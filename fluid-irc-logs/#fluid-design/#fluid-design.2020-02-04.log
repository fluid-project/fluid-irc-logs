2020-02-04T18:03:27  <danayo> cherylhjli, greatislander, jhung, michelled: Re: Michael’s emails about rescheduling shall I suggest 2-2:30 for the PC team checkin tomorrow?  We have another meeting scheduled at 1 for our platform brainstorming.
2020-02-04T18:03:41  <greatislander> Yeah, that would be good danayo
2020-02-04T18:05:30  <erictheise> 3-3:30 would be better for me, danayo, but I can make it work if that’s all that’s available.
2020-02-04T18:05:57  <danayo> erictheise: we have our community meeting then (2:30-4ET)
2020-02-04T18:06:28  <erictheise> ok, 2-2:30 will work.
2020-02-04T18:07:06  <danayo> erictheise: I don’t think we all need to be at the meeting anyway, so we should probably decide who’s attending
2020-02-04T18:11:42  <danayo> but also cherylhjli, greatislander, jhung, michelled I see that Justin has schedule the 1Password meeting at 2…I wonder if we should just cancel until next week? or are there pressing things we need to discuss?
2020-02-04T18:11:50  <danayo> and erictheise^ sorry
2020-02-04T18:12:32  <cherylhjli> I dont have anything pressing danayo
2020-02-04T18:15:20  <greatislander> imho we can skip it
2020-02-04T18:16:09  <greatislander> For myself, I've used 1Password for years so worst case scenario I could join a meeting with them at that time if necessary. But I'd rather not given how much work I've got underway.
2020-02-04T18:18:40  <danayo> thanks cherylhjli, greatislander
2020-02-04T18:35:30  <danayo> gmoss: I can’t remember if you’ve seen this doc or not? michelled put it together - I find tracking the issues in a spreadsheet much easier https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_MYdS2ASPERITszN7bmdvnsrfRtdRb2hmZGTJkOc7WM/edit?usp=sharing
2020-02-04T18:35:57  <danayo> it’s based on the “task master” doc, but I suggest we use this one going forward, if that works for you
2020-02-04T18:36:41  <gmoss> danayo: yes I have seen it, thanks for checking! I filled in a little bit about the technical issues in the lower rows. I agree that this is easier than a text doc :)
2020-02-04T18:36:53  <danayo> ah ok! thanks gmoss

2020-02-04T21:28:21  <michelled> greatislander: when Michael is creating a blog post, is he able to add alt text for images?
2020-02-04T21:28:39  <greatislander> Yes, but he chooses not to…
2020-02-04T21:29:25  <greatislander> This is what he'd see when inserting an image
2020-02-04T21:29:35  <greatislander> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/cCVuU93R/Alt%20text
2020-02-04T21:30:09  <michelled> yeah, that's a pretty obvious spot to put in alt text!
2020-02-04T21:30:16  <greatislander> There's a great thing I saw lately— someone created a starter CSS reset which adds a 10px radius blur to any image that doesn't have alt text
2020-02-04T21:30:18  <greatislander> :)
2020-02-04T21:30:31  <michelled> haha, that's great
2020-02-04T21:33:44  <greatislander> maybe I'll add that to pinecone
