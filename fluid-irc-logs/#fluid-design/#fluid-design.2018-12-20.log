2018-12-20T18:51:14  <caren> michelled: colinclark everyone I have Osmo coding in my desk, would you like to hang on to it for any projects?
2018-12-20T18:54:24  <michelled> sounds like it'll be useful for the Coding project! maybe simonjb would be interested in taking a look caren
2018-12-20T18:55:39  <simonjb> thanks caren michelled, it would be great to have a look at it (we also have one in our budget to buy for ourselves)
2018-12-20T18:55:53  <simonjb> I won't be in the office again now until Jan
2018-12-20T18:56:56  <avtar> cherylhjli, colinclark, michelled: are we using vidyo at 2:00 for the platform co-op call?

2018-12-20T19:15:45  <cherylhjli> avtar: can you direct me to the document that contains the sentences he's talking about?
2018-12-20T19:19:04  <avtar> yup

2018-12-20T19:19:37  <avtar> and the text that he was referring to earlier was pasted in the zoom chat:
2018-12-20T19:19:43  <avtar> LANGUAGE: Platform co-ops build a humane, diversified, and democratic digital economy through shared ownership for better paid work worldwide.
2018-12-20T19:19:43  <avtar> The Platform Co-op Consortium is a hub that supports the growth of platform co-ops through stakeholder-centered innovation. We provide policy analysis, research, education, movement building, and open source tools.
2018-12-20T19:21:06  <cherylhjli> avtar: Thanks! it's is quite academic language

2018-12-20T19:43:03  <simonjb> caren: good question, maybe leave with someone in the office and they could keep in their locker?
2018-12-20T19:46:01  <caren> I’ve had them locked in my desk drawer but our paths don’t cross oftern simonjb. Maybe michelled has a spot that could give you better access.
2018-12-20T19:46:15  <michelled> yep! for sure
2018-12-20T19:46:32  <caren> michelled: awesome, I’ll drop the boxes with you
