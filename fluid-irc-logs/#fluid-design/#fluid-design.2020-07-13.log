2020-07-13T16:31:09  <cindyli> Uttara: thanks for updating the figma with the hover/focus style for unchecked checkboxes when "enhance inputs" is enabled. I probably didn't make it clear last Friday. I was looking for the hover/focus style for CHECKED checkboxes when "enhance inputs" is enabled.

2020-07-13T17:28:17  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2020-07-13T17:44:11  <jhung> greatislander The graph always shows the data as 100% Unknown (i.e. 195 Unknown, and 0 for the rest).
2020-07-13T17:44:25  <greatislander> That's correct, there's no scope data in the production database.
2020-07-13T17:44:28  <greatislander> :(
2020-07-13T17:44:41  <jhung> Ah ok.
