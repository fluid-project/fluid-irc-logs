2019-11-15T17:38:09  <michelled> gmoss: you might as well remove the storybuilder how to from the SJRK story collection
2019-11-15T17:39:18  <gmoss> michelled: I'll delete it, but I suspect it will reappear on the next CI build. Maybe we should remove it from the db config grade
2019-11-15T17:39:44  <gmoss> I'm fairly certain I've seen it reappear in the past
2019-11-15T17:39:57  <michelled> hmmm‚Ä¶ we shouldn't have CI for a live site - do we?
2019-11-15T17:41:05  <gmoss> Well it's an idempotent process, so I'm not concerned about losing stories, but all of our deployed versions are built by Jenkins iirc

2019-11-15T17:41:43  <gmoss> I think it's a good measure to prevent non-passing builds from making it to prod, assuming our tests catch the right things :)

2019-11-15T20:45:54  <gmoss> greatislander: thanks for finding that MDN reference for your SJRK-292 PR! funny thing: I was a .net dev for 6.5 years before coming to the IDRC, and I keep reading "MDN" as "MSDN" and getting mildly confused for a half-second hahaha
2019-11-15T20:46:04  <greatislander> lol
2019-11-15T20:46:07  <greatislander> That's hilarious
2019-11-15T20:46:08  <greatislander> !
2019-11-15T20:46:26  <gmoss> both are incredibly useful resources, but quite different :)
2019-11-15T20:46:33  <greatislander> indeed :)
2019-11-15T20:47:56  <gmoss> greatislander: also kind of funny that what I thought would be a two-character fix for that issue has blossomed into a fruitful discussion about l10n :) I do appreciate that you're putting the time into it
2019-11-15T20:48:04  <greatislander> My instinct is to not modify case for any of the non-English message files for View, Grid, List‚Ä¶ I don't know if you have any thoughts on that gmoss or cindyli1
2019-11-15T20:48:38  <greatislander> Indeed! It's nice to have a little side task to clear my mind now and again :)
2019-11-15T20:48:51  <gmoss> greatislander: it should be fine to update it for French, otherwise I agree that it would be best to leave them alone.
2019-11-15T20:49:17  <greatislander> sounds good
2019-11-15T20:49:50  <greatislander> actually, those strings aren't present in the French file!
2019-11-15T20:49:54  <gmoss> greatislander: that said, most of the message bundles are woefully out of date and aren't lined up with English either way, and the option to switch locales isn't currently enabledf
2019-11-15T20:50:02  <greatislander> gotcha
2019-11-15T20:50:09  <gmoss> I feel like we have a Jira for that
2019-11-15T20:50:11  <gmoss> checking...

2019-11-15T20:52:53  <gmoss> we didn't, we do now: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-314
2019-11-15T20:54:51  <greatislander> üëç
2019-11-15T21:24:12  <gmoss> thanks cindyli1 for merging that PR :) I'm working on your SJRK-297 suggestion, but I'm getting some buggy behaviour from the distributeOptions for authoringEnabled
2019-11-15T21:25:06  <cindyli1> no problem, gmoss. let me know if you need help with the distributeOptions
2019-11-15T21:26:54  <gmoss> cindyli1: actually yes please! it would be helpful to know if my IoCSS is correctly targeting every `ui` subcomponent of a given page grade: https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blob/b5ca23057776dbd001ae86efa5ce567ff8f0e3e0/src/ui/base-page.js#L29
2019-11-15T21:28:17  <gmoss> cindyli1: I'll have to investigate to see if this is affecting more than just this branch. I blew away my node_modules folder just in case there was some leftover stuff from working on SJRK-255, but that didn't seem to make much difference
2019-11-15T21:34:43  <gmoss> cindyli1: the odd thing is that it seems to work fine on the Edit page, but not View or Browse
2019-11-15T21:51:19  <cindyli1> gmoss: having a look but seems I need more time to understand the component structure. I have to run right now. is it too late to look into this on Monday?
2019-11-15T21:54:58  <gmoss> cindyli1: no worries at all :)
2019-11-15T21:55:14  <gmoss> it can wait for sure. I'll dig around some more
2019-11-15T21:55:52  <cindyli1> ok. thanks, gmoss
