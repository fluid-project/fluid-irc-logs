2020-03-11T17:56:15  <Justin_o> greatislander: how do you see the style values in the figma site. I can see the visual designs but not sure how to bring up the details.
2020-03-11T17:56:31  <greatislander>  if you click them there should be an inspector that appears in the sidebar
2020-03-11T17:56:40  <greatislander> (click individual elements, that is)
2020-03-11T17:56:53  <Justin_o> not getting that.. maybe I need an account
2020-03-11T17:57:24  <Teddy___> yeah you need to an account or you can sign in through gmail

2020-03-11T19:00:41  <michelled> Caren_: what's your question?
2020-03-11T19:03:34  <Teddy___> Thanks cindyli
2020-03-11T19:03:54  <Caren_> hi michelled is there a limit to the story length / number of blocks ? An extensive story with photos was shared with me recently. I was going to suggest it for the storytelling site but wanted to check first.
2020-03-11T19:04:36  <michelled> Caren_: there shouldn't be
2020-03-11T19:04:55  <michelled> or rather, I should say that the limit should be so large that you shouldn't hit it
2020-03-11T19:05:07  <michelled> alanharnum, gmoss: do you agree with that?  ^
2020-03-11T19:05:50  <alanharnum> michelled gmoss: I'd generally agree with that, there's not an overall limit
2020-03-11T19:06:18  <Caren_> thank you michelled alanharnum
2020-03-11T19:06:25  <gmoss> Caren_: I don't think there's a limit to the number of blocks, but I can confirm this. I.e. there is probably a VERY high number maximum, in the hundreds of thousands or more :) There is currently a limit of 100 stories, which we'll be working on
2020-03-11T19:06:51  <gmoss> i.e. if there are more than 100 stories in the database, they won't be reachable other than directly by ID on the view page
2020-03-11T19:07:04  <gmoss> it will only load in the top 100 ordered alphabetically by ID
2020-03-11T19:08:01  <Caren_> ah, gmoss I’m wondering about an individual story length.
2020-03-11T19:08:17  <gmoss> Caren_: right, i don't think there's a practical limit
2020-03-11T19:08:17  <Caren_> not the number of stories on the site
2020-03-11T19:08:44  <michelled> gmoss: is that issue captured in the priorities? I don't think I was aware of it - or I've forgotten
2020-03-11T19:08:45  <gmoss> oh. actually now that I think of it, there might be a maximum of 10 media files...
2020-03-11T19:09:03  <gmoss> michelled: there's a Jira for it, i don't think it's included on the planning spreadsheet
2020-03-11T19:09:22  <gmoss> Caren_: ^ I believe there is a maximum number of files
2020-03-11T19:09:37  <gmoss> I will confirm this, is it okay if i check after the community meeting?
2020-03-11T19:10:03  <Caren_> for sure, that would be great. Thanks gmoss
2020-03-11T19:10:21  <gmoss> Caren_: of course :) I'll fire off an email about all the related numbers
2020-03-11T19:12:34  <Caren_> yay. I’m going to start that Storytelling Manual and include the info you send along gmoss michelled alanharnum
2020-03-11T19:18:25  <michelled> Caren_: I can't remember what the storytelling manual is, can you remind me?
2020-03-11T19:27:09  <Caren_> michelled: I suggested we document items that support various interactions with the stie/tool—similar to what Eloisa and Jon started and I worked on for SNOW. I understand SNOW was more about giveing me autonomy with the site as a whole but I think It could be useful for the Storytelling tool as a reference for questions that come up like length of stories, what URL to use to post stories, process for having the
2020-03-11T19:27:09  <Caren_> opened for posting/workshop, and so on. It could help support someone unfamiliar with the tool that needs take the reigns and minimize repetitive quesitons (from me :-) ).
2020-03-11T19:31:06  <michelled> ah right, thx Caren_
2020-03-11T19:32:02  <Caren_> np michelled
2020-03-11T19:33:31  <Caren_> michelled: sorry I have another question, not sure if you’re the right person to ask.
2020-03-11T19:34:57  <michelled> I can generaly point out the correct person so I'm a good person to ask regardless :)
2020-03-11T19:37:28  <Caren_> thanks michelled :-)
2020-03-11T19:38:28  <Caren_> hi alanharnum is it possible to give me access to stories email inbox/address?
2020-03-11T19:39:05  <alanharnum> hi Caren_, let me look into what's needed for that
2020-03-11T19:39:24  <Caren_> thanks alanharnum

2020-03-11T20:09:00  <Justin_o> lliskovoi___: what do you think of the example search input used here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search
2020-03-11T20:09:25  <Justin_o> specifically having a label and an aria-label
2020-03-11T20:14:44  <lliskovoi___> Justin_o: I think it's a good idea to differentiate the site search from other searches if the site has multiple, but since the visible label is also 'search the site' I don't see the point of having both, the aria-label will just override the regular label with slightly different text
2020-03-11T20:15:30  <Justin_o> lliskovoi___: thanks, that's what I was thinking. I guess maybe they did that here because they wanted something more descriptive for the AT than for the visual user.
2020-03-11T20:16:47  <lliskovoi___> Justin_o: yeah it sort of makes sense, I think they just need a better example
2020-03-11T20:17:02  <Justin_o> true :) thanks
