2020-02-10T18:44:36  <michelled> danielcho, simonjb: is this bug something we want to schedule? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/C2LC-20
2020-02-10T18:45:01  <michelled> also this one? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/C2LC-6
2020-02-10T18:45:35  <michelled> and this task? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/C2LC-23
2020-02-10T18:46:00  <simonjb> for C2LC-20, speech recognition isn't enabled in the current release, so not currently revelant
2020-02-10T18:46:30  <simonjb> C2LC-6, we don't have Step in the current interface
2020-02-10T18:47:30  <simonjb> C2LC-23, I think is done. Let's schedule it for 0.2.1 and I can verify and close
2020-02-10T18:49:57  <michelled> great, I've added the NeedsDesign label to the unscheduled features now
2020-02-10T18:50:03  <simonjb> thanks for going through the issues michelled
2020-02-10T18:50:09  <michelled> np
2020-02-10T18:51:33  <simonjb> michelled: I'll add the non-design features that we discussed with Colin last week -- those will not have NeedsDesign and won't need
2020-02-10T18:52:48  <michelled> makes sense

2020-02-10T18:59:26  <simonjb> michelled: or make in a task for making the release?
2020-02-10T18:59:36  <simonjb> *make it
2020-02-10T19:00:08  <michelled> let's make it the release task
2020-02-10T19:00:24  <michelled> I think it would be helpful to have
2020-02-10T19:00:38  <simonjb> sounds good

2020-02-10T20:53:36  <jhung> greatislander - just to give you an update, cherylhjli1 and I worked out the styling. We won't be using a :focus:active style, but instead just :focus and :active. Focus will add a border / box-shadow only (other changes to text or background). Active will have both a box shadow, color, and background change.
2020-02-10T20:54:22  <jhung> cherylhjli1 will be updating the state table.
