2019-08-08T13:51:02  <simonjb> Kendraf: would it be available at the moment for danielcho to use?
2019-08-08T14:14:26  <Kendraf> hi hi yes
2019-08-08T14:15:36  <Kendraf> he has it now :)

2019-08-08T15:00:36  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: missing standup due to SJRK partners meeting. Yesterday I was off the whole day on account of a headache. Today my plan is basically what I said in standup yesterday :D (SJRK-263, some Community Meeting things)
2019-08-08T15:06:13  <jhung> sepidehshahi, crystalchan, kendraf - how did you get a release for the photos / videos from the C2LC camps? Did you secure it in advance, or did you ask for it after the fact?
2019-08-08T15:06:48  <jhung> *or was it included in the CC4.0 / CLA?
2019-08-08T15:07:15  <sepidehshahi> jhung: all the parents had to sign a media release form prior to attending the camp

2019-08-08T15:09:01  <sepidehshahi> some of the parents didn’t sign those forms or didn’t give permission. So during our sessions we tried to not take those kids photos or videos or if we had accidentally taken their photos we removed them from our files.
2019-08-08T15:09:17  <sepidehshahi> for sure jhung
2019-08-08T15:09:40  <jhung> good to know, and thanks!

2019-08-08T18:32:52  <greatislander> jhung I found this today. I'd heard of it before but it seems incredibly relevant to what we are trying to do with learning commons: https://facetwp.com/
2019-08-08T18:32:52  <greatislander> Not open source, unfortunately.

2019-08-08T19:04:54  <jhung> cherylhjli - question about the sub-topics for the Learning Commons... is it possible that a sub-topic appear in more than one topic? For example, I can see items under Labour rights also be applicable to Policy and Law. Then what happens if you check one sub-topic, does it check in the other topic?
2019-08-08T19:08:10  <cherylhjli> hmmm that's a good question!
2019-08-08T19:08:20  <cherylhjli> I mean I think ideally it wouldn't have an overlap… but I don't know how realistic that is
2019-08-08T19:10:14  <jhung> Yeah. A worker may see the sub-topic of Unionization under Labour Rights, whereas someone else may see it as a Legal issue. To me where you will look largely depends on your context.
2019-08-08T19:12:14  <cherylhjli> yeah I have no doubt of that
2019-08-08T19:12:19  <cherylhjli> all depends on your mental model
2019-08-08T19:12:26  <cherylhjli> I think we were thinking about doing card sorting during some of these co-design chats too
2019-08-08T19:12:32  <greatislander> cherylhjli jhung danayo_ colinclark I'm off my call with Toni and Damian if you want to regroup
2019-08-08T19:12:37  <greatislander> (or need to)
2019-08-08T19:12:48  <cherylhjli> I think colinclark jhung and I have a brief meeting about the IDRC website
2019-08-08T19:12:55  <greatislander> ah okay
2019-08-08T19:12:56  <cherylhjli> do folks feel like we need to do a quick regroup tho?
2019-08-08T19:13:11  <cherylhjli> we covered a lot today
2019-08-08T19:13:14  * greatislander shrugs
2019-08-08T19:13:21  <greatislander> How did the conversation about topics go?
2019-08-08T19:13:27  <greatislander> Did it make sense to them?
2019-08-08T19:13:56  <greatislander> Re: jhung's question about topics appearing under multiple parents, I don't think WordPress supports that but I will have to check
2019-08-08T19:14:09  <colinclark> i’m happy to debrief if you’d like
2019-08-08T19:14:21  <cherylhjli> I think Trebor didn't anticipate needing to even tag the new resources that people were gathering, and was overwhelmed by the amount of work that is needed - but I think Michael got it pretty clearly that figuring out a workflow for moderation is needed
2019-08-08T19:14:24  <cherylhjli> sure, my room?

2019-08-08T19:35:11  <sepidehshahi> hi alanharnum, do you know who the admin is for the Community mailing list?
2019-08-08T19:36:23  <sepidehshahi> I have tried sending out an emial twice today, it shows up in my sent emails but no one receives it. I was wondering maybe something needs to be done at the admin level alanharnum
2019-08-08T19:38:02  <alanharnum> sepidedshahi: colinclark and jessmitchell are the admins officially, but I can admin any list if need be. What address are you sending to? We've had issues in the past with Outlook saving and using the community-bounces@lists.idrc.ocadu.ca email (which won't work) instead of the community@lists.idrc.ocadu.ca email
2019-08-08T19:39:52  <alanharnum> There are no pending moderator requests, so I don't think it's getting held up for admin or similar.

2019-08-08T20:41:46  <sepidehshahi> thanks alanharnum for checking. I have been sending it through the  community@lists.idrc.ocadu.ca I’ll retry one more time and hopefully it will work
2019-08-08T20:42:26  <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: can you forward a copy of the email you're trying to send to me as well? it's possible something in it is triggering our SpamHero filter or similar; I'll investigate further.
2019-08-08T20:42:51  <sepidehshahi> sure, I’ll send a copy to you
2019-08-08T20:44:34  <sepidehshahi> I just sent it alanharnum, I sent a copy tomyself and it was delivered fine
2019-08-08T20:52:43  <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I don't see it getting quarantined by SpamHero either - the only odd thing I do notice in the email you sent me is that it has "Signed By - There are problems with the signature. Click the signature button for details." in the headers, which seems to be connected to your emails having a self-signed encryption certificate attached. Does that sound at all familiar?
2019-08-08T20:54:33  <sepidehshahi> yes, I don’t know how I have got that certificate. I deleted it from my keychain but it still shows up in my emails. Thanks for looking into this. Tomorrow I will do further research on this and hopefully can send out the email
2019-08-08T20:54:38  <sepidehshahi> thanks alanharnum
2019-08-08T20:54:46  <alanharnum> in the meantime, since it looks like this is time-sensitive, do you want me to send the email on your behalf?
2019-08-08T20:56:46  <alanharnum> the other thing you might try is sending the email from the outlook.ocadu.ca web client (assuming you're sending from Outlook desktop client due to the cert issue)
