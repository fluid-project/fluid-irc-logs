2018-10-23T15:22:19  <Justin_o> jhung, carenwatkins_ : i wonder if the index just needs to be flushed. Maybe something has been cached or it hasn't been updated or something. Not sure how to do that though.
2018-10-23T15:24:32  <carenwatkins_> ok, thanks Justin_o
2018-10-23T15:24:39  <carenwatkins_> I'll try it incognito
2018-10-23T15:26:09  <jhung> Justin_o, carenwatkins_ - I'm thinking the same. There used to be a way to reindex a WP site. I can't seem to find it right now. I'll dig a little and see what I can find.
2018-10-23T15:28:11  <carenwatkins_> Justin_o jhung  When I search the site incognito, nothing shows...so you're correct. Does it mean that WP still need to be "flushed"?
2018-10-23T15:31:39  <jhung> carenwatkins_: try logging out of SNOW and logging back in. Sometimes that might help.
2018-10-23T15:34:03  <carenwatkins_> jhung: I'm curious if it affects external users, if they might get dead links showing up when searching. If not I'm not worried about how it renders on my system.
2018-10-23T15:34:40  <jhung> Yeah. I'm looking for a way to fix this.

2018-10-23T19:42:14  <danayo_> colinclark, michelled: wanted to update you where I'm at with the deliverables graphic. I think it's just about done - I need to tweak the text (spread out the letters a bit) and add white background to the remaining illustrations. There is a wide and narrow version https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Kk9Ngg2RJ7R4QJT
2018-10-23T19:42:47  <danayo_> all feedback welcome (from anyone) :)
2018-10-23T19:48:50  <michelled> I love this danayo
2018-10-23T19:49:26  <michelled> the only thing I would say is that the customizable & open source governance tools pic looks like people are asking a question or answering a teacher
2018-10-23T19:49:51  <michelled> but I dont know what would better depict that
2018-10-23T19:51:15  <danayo> yeah…that one is tricky
2018-10-23T19:51:18  <danayo> thanks michelled
2018-10-23T19:51:54  <danayo> I had a kind of toolbox in the clouds at one point
2018-10-23T19:53:31  <danayo> sepidehshahi, jhung: would welcome your thoughts on the graphic above if you have time ^
2018-10-23T19:59:59  <jhung> danayo: for Governance Tools, maybe two hands linking gears / cogs together? I think of governance as something that helps get work down between people.
2018-10-23T20:01:57  <jhung> For cooperative curriculum, the effectiveness of the graphic relies on being able to read the letters on the books. It'd be cool if there were a more graphical way of representing that danayo.
2018-10-23T20:02:53  <danayo> thanks jhung!
2018-10-23T20:04:37  <colinclark> danayo, danayo: I'm trying to come up with any constructive criticism for it
2018-10-23T20:04:42  <colinclark> but the thing is that I really like it :)
2018-10-23T20:04:54  <danayo> :D thanks colinclark
2018-10-23T20:05:11  <colinclark> Most of my comments might be minor details, and probably not important
2018-10-23T20:05:18  <danayo> jhung that’s a good point about the text on the notebooks
2018-10-23T20:05:27  <colinclark> there's something about the quality of the line in the Community Engagement Calls illustration
2018-10-23T20:05:36  <colinclark> that is a little "dustier" than most of the others
2018-10-23T20:05:46  <jhung> danayo: maybe Roman numerals I, II, and III might suffice?
2018-10-23T20:05:55  <colinclark> in a funny way, I think it actually illustrates the glitchiness of video conferencing pretty well
2018-10-23T20:05:59  <colinclark> but it does stand out slightly because of it
2018-10-23T20:06:03  <jhung> or maybe shapes (triangle, circle, square)
2018-10-23T20:06:21  <colinclark> I do love the "Global Co-Written Narrative"
2018-10-23T20:06:27  <danayo> yes colinclark - my first illustrations were much “sketchier” - similar to the laptop. but that’s true about the glitchiness, hadn’t thought of that
2018-10-23T20:06:29  <colinclark> both the title and your illustration
2018-10-23T20:07:09  <colinclark> If you had tons of spare time, I think I'd say it might be worth exploring redrawing that one with the same pen style as the money bags and global book, etc.
2018-10-23T20:07:41  <colinclark> the mobile phone in the centre of Customizeable & Open has kind of a different line style too, from the other styles
2018-10-23T20:07:55  <colinclark> but I'm quite okay with the fact that they're all slighlty different
2018-10-23T20:08:16  <colinclark> I like the way the colour of the bubbles bleeds into the negative space of some of the illustrations a little bit
2018-10-23T20:08:30  <danayo> colinclark: agreed - I realised that there is quite a mix of line styles in it
2018-10-23T20:09:17  <colinclark> it speaks to the hand-drawn and eclectic style, so I don't think it's a big deal
2018-10-23T20:09:55  <michelled> danayo: I'm wondering about the legibility of the narrow one on a phone screen - I just looked on mine. but the thing is that there is really a lot in this illustration and collapsing to two columns doesn't seem like a great idea
2018-10-23T20:09:57  <danayo> I think there are some small tweaks I can make colinclark
2018-10-23T20:10:10  <danayo> jhung: I like the roman numerals idea
2018-10-23T20:10:24  <colinclark> michelled: Like it's too small on your phone?
2018-10-23T20:10:27  <danayo> michelled: yeah, i’m not sure what to do about mobile

2018-10-23T20:51:44  <sepidehshahi> danayo: I love the illustration for platform coop. Awesome job :)
2018-10-23T20:52:11  <carenwatkins_> Hi danayo great looking interface design!
2018-10-23T20:53:00  <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi, carenwatkins_
2018-10-23T20:53:14  <carenwatkins_> I had a couple of thoughts but totally understand if you're "done" so to speak
2018-10-23T20:54:07  <carenwatkins_> 1. all caps on long headers is challenging to read. Perhaps the headers could be shortened to keep the caps?
2018-10-23T20:55:00  <danayo> carenwatkins_: more than happy to hear your feedback :)
2018-10-23T20:55:41  <carenwatkins_> 2. I really like the illustrations sitting on white. The white visually brings them forward and separates them from the headers, possibly allowing the eye to scan images separately from the words.
2018-10-23T20:56:34  <carenwatkins_> And vice versa
2018-10-23T20:56:58  <danayo> thanks carenwatkins_. My plan is definitely to add white background to all illustrations
2018-10-23T20:57:22  <carenwatkins_> :)
2018-10-23T20:57:23  <danayo> for the caps - I wonder - it would be nice to have shorter headers
2018-10-23T20:57:56  <carenwatkins_> it feels like a lot to read on an entry page
2018-10-23T20:58:18  <danayo> I’m kind of attached to the all-caps look so I’d rather shorten them
2018-10-23T20:58:24  <danayo> it’s true it’s alot to read
2018-10-23T20:58:40  <danayo> and the details can be found elsewhere

2018-10-23T21:01:56  <danayo> that would be cool carenwatkins_
2018-10-23T21:02:36  <danayo> carenwatkins_: I also plan to clean up/spread out some of the letters and increase spacing between the lines
2018-10-23T21:03:03  <danayo> I whipped that text in there and need to go back and make it consistent and tidy it up

2018-10-23T21:06:34  <carenwatkins_> Sweet! I really like the feel. The organic "blobs" are so cool and can be a fun element. I keep thinking of the blobs in a lava lamp and the ever changing positions and sizes as the blobs interact with each other.
