2020-09-09T15:01:28  <Uttara> Teddy__ and cindyli: Do you have some time to meet up? May b at 12? After the stand up. This is about the Badges tile
2020-09-09T15:05:14  <cindyli> sure, Uttara. we're in a wecount meeting right now and will skip the standup. we'll ping you when the wecount meeting is over
2020-09-09T15:05:37  <cindyli> philip: are you coming to the wecount meeting?
2020-09-09T15:06:23  <philip> cindyli: yes, thanks for the reminder. I misread the scheduled time
2020-09-09T15:18:55  <cindyli> colinclark: in our discussion with Bosmon and philip yesterday, you mentioned some points that AI could possibly be applied to the data framework. can you restate what those points are?
2020-09-09T15:19:22  <colinclark> I’ll try to remember what I was thinking aloud about…
2020-09-09T15:20:07  <colinclark> My first point was that I think there’s a part of our inclusive data toolkit that should not only allow communities and individuals to have their own personal collections of data
2020-09-09T15:20:34  <colinclark> but to also choose what kinds of algorithms and techniques are used to make sense of that data, and to make decisions with it
2020-09-09T15:21:06  <colinclark> Choosing, for example, the degree to which automated decisions are appropriate with their data, and what kinds
2020-09-09T15:21:45  <colinclark> I also started to think about the idea of tools for data science, which would allow people to better explore the “gaps” and “noise” within data sets, which may in fact be significant
2020-09-09T15:22:11  <colinclark> these may not be pure ML tools, but rather ways to explore, browse, and visualize large data sets from non-normative perspectives
2020-09-09T15:23:12  <colinclark> I guess, still, the most thinking we’ve done about this is in terms of personal “thick” data sets in learning with MyL3
2020-09-09T15:23:41  <colinclark> where you might have the ability to choose what data to gather, but also what kinds of inferences get made and displayed to you (e.g. as “goals”)
2020-09-09T15:26:29  <cindyli> great points. thanks
2020-09-09T16:14:16  <cindyli> Uttara: Teddy___ and i are ready to chat whenever you are ready
2020-09-09T16:15:01  <Uttara> cindyli: yes I am in the wecount room
2020-09-09T16:15:15  <cindyli> coming
2020-09-09T16:54:50  <cindyli> Uttara: i'm looking at the badgets page you created in the wordpress. where do you want it to show on the top nav bar?
2020-09-09T17:11:59  <cindyli> Uttara: i've added it in between "Learn" and "Inclusion Challenges" - https://dev--wecount.netlify.app/. but now the top nav bar is more crowdy, on the ipad pro, the search box gets pushed out of the screen. this can be fixed by using the menu icon as on other smaller screens. what do you think?
2020-09-09T17:23:54  <cindyli> i renamed "stackable badges" to "badges", still the same issue with the ipad pro portrait
