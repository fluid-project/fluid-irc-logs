2020-07-15T14:43:48  <jhung> colinclark and michelled on the Floe site, some of the partnerships are out of date. Any suggestions as to an updated partners list?
2020-07-15T14:47:17  <colinclark> Not sure about this, just thinking, but I wonder if our approach has broadened, such that a dedicated partner list might not make sense
2020-07-15T14:47:24  <colinclark> we work with so many different groups now on Floe
2020-07-15T14:49:12  <jhung> colinclark That's very true. I think if we keep up to date on news activities, the spirit of partnerships is conveyed.
2020-07-15T14:49:21  <colinclark> Yeah, that’s a good point
2020-07-15T14:49:46  <colinclark> I figure Partners pages are best in cases where you’ve got a project with formal partnerships, but I’m not sure
2020-07-15T14:55:59  <jhung> colinclark ok. I'll reply to JT's thread and propose removing the Partnerships section, or at the very least an updated list from her if we need to keep it.
2020-07-15T14:58:50  <colinclark> cool, she may have a very different idea
2020-07-15T15:06:25  <jhung> colinclark that's definitely a possibility. I'm mentally prepared for that. :)
2020-07-15T15:06:30  <colinclark> hahaha
2020-07-15T15:06:42  <colinclark> I’ll mentally prepare myself too :)
2020-07-15T15:51:20  <michelled> gmoss: will there be a storytelling check in today?
2020-07-15T15:51:30  <gmoss> michelled: yep, I'm planning to!
2020-07-15T15:51:46  <michelled> cool
2020-07-15T15:51:47  <gmoss> at 12:30, if that works for everyone else
2020-07-15T15:52:53  <danayo> works for me gmoss
2020-07-15T16:01:20  <danayo> hi jhung, I assigned this to you but not sure if that’s appropriate, it’s a small content change to the design guide https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-587
2020-07-15T16:03:05  <danayo> There will likely be lots more changes to the guide if/when we get to it, but this one stuck out to me when I was looking through the guide yesterday
2020-07-15T16:05:46  <danayo> I remember this issue came up possibly in one of Jutta’s classes or elsewhere - the use of the word “targeted” having negative/violent associations for many
2020-07-15T16:06:02  <colinclark> yes, that’s a good point danayo
2020-07-15T16:06:26  <colinclark> words really do matter
2020-07-15T16:06:39  <danayo> yes colinclark!
2020-07-15T16:08:58  <danayo> cherylhjli: not sure if you saw this but this is the wiki page where I put the Guide for Embedded Co-Design https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Guide+for+Embedded+Co-design
2020-07-15T16:09:18  <danayo> Just FYI for future work on a guide/kit
2020-07-15T16:10:24  <cherylhjli> thanks danayo - do you want to check in on embedded co-design work tomorrow? now that the diagrams for Jutta are done I should have a lot more free time
2020-07-15T16:12:00  <danayo> sure cherylhjli
2020-07-15T16:13:58  <jhung> danayo ok cool. I'll take a look at it.
2020-07-15T16:22:09  <danayo> thanks jhung
2020-07-15T16:26:44  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: ST check-in at 12:30?
2020-07-15T16:26:55  <michelled> yup
2020-07-15T16:27:33  <Justin_o> okay
2020-07-15T16:27:45  <cindyli> sure
2020-07-15T16:27:57  <danayo> see you soon
