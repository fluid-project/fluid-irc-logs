2019-09-20T14:00:08  <simonjb> danielcho: I've started some notes on "Coding Conventions" for the C2LC coding environment https://github.com/simonbates/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/C2LC-14/CONTRIBUTING.md
2019-09-20T14:00:43  <simonjb> they are very terse right now but I will fill them out as we evolve the code
2019-09-20T14:02:18  <danielcho> simonjb: thanks for letting me know! I am also watching your git repo, so I will check whenever there's notifications
2019-09-20T14:02:31  <simonjb> ok, awesome

2019-09-20T19:03:08  <greatislander> Does anyone know if having a list of items randomize every page load without user choosing to randomize it would be considered a violation of the WCAG predictability criteria (https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior.html)? My instinct is that it would be… jhung or anyone else have thoughts on that?

2019-09-20T19:11:12  <jhung> greatislander I think predictability has more to do with the structure and cognitive understanding of the content. What you're describing isn't quite that. I think if it's understood that the list is random or dynamic in nature it should be okay. The header or description should communicate or imply its dynamic nature (like "Current weather" on a news site).
2019-09-20T19:13:02  <greatislander> Okay. Context is that the desired behaviour for the list of participants is for it *not* to be alphabetical order so that people can discover participants more organically and those with names later in the alphabet won't be stuck at the bottom. Trying to figure out how to do that in a way that isn't confusing—I think your suggestion is good.

2019-09-20T19:18:15  <jhung> Yeah, I think it will come down to how the list is communicated to the user. A good label / description I think should help.
