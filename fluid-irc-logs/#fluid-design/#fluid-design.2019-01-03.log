2019-01-03T16:30:05  <cherylhjli> good morning danayo! I've done some organizing and restructuring of the platform coop folder. I've started by sorting the top level by projects, and then within each project folder there are different folders for different design activities. let me know what you think!
2019-01-03T16:33:04  <danayo> that sounds great cherylhjli, thanks, I’ll take a look
2019-01-03T17:00:04  <cherylhjli> also, here's my brain dump on ideas for how to make the website seem more dynamic / alive. feel free to add to it. https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/xCRdl2nygyoQ3PG
2019-01-03T17:10:33  <danayo> thanks cherylhjli
2019-01-03T17:20:33  <colinclark> cherylhjli: your brainstorming doc would make a great wiki page
2019-01-03T17:20:59  <colinclark> just thinkig in terms of open studio methods, a wiki page is easily findable and linkable, and can be contributed to by others
2019-01-03T17:21:28  <cherylhjli> colinclark - can definitely put it on wiki! out of curiosity, what should go up on wiki and what can stay in a word doc somewhere?
2019-01-03T17:23:44  <colinclark> well, that's a great question :)
2019-01-03T17:24:20  <colinclark> I think a lot of it is contextual
2019-01-03T17:24:51  <colinclark> but the idea of designing in an open studio is that we're extending the opportunities for low-investment participation
2019-01-03T17:25:09  <colinclark> by giving people a way to follow along with our thoughts and work in progress
2019-01-03T17:26:47  <colinclark> I think, in general, if it's something that someone else might like follow along to understand our thought process or design motivations, or potentially contribute to—like, say, danayo or me—then it's probably a good candidate for a wiki page
2019-01-03T17:27:48  <colinclark> A big goal fo the Platform Cooperative Development Kit project is to catalyze a community of contributors who can help sustain the tools and resources we design
2019-01-03T17:27:51  *** danayo_ <danayo_!~danayo@S01069050ca694f23.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-design
2019-01-03T17:28:13  <colinclark> and part of the way to do that is build up that history of practice in a way that they can access it
2019-01-03T17:28:22  <colinclark> this happens in different ways, depending on the kind of thing it is
2019-01-03T17:28:48  <colinclark> Bosmon, for example, writes essay-length JIRAs in which he describes his thoughts-in-progress and motivations for features of our Infusio framework
2019-01-03T17:29:17  <colinclark> I try to post my ideas-in-progress about co-design or community building in the wiki
2019-01-03T17:31:08  <danayo_> thanks for this colinclark - I agree that it would be great to post these thoughts on the wiki cherylhjli
2019-01-03T17:31:12  <danayo_>  and I will have to check out some of Bosmon's JIRA essays! :)

2019-01-03T17:31:47  <colinclark> I think we should create a wiki page some time that gathers together different Open Studio Methods
2019-01-03T17:31:50  <colinclark> with capital letters
2019-01-03T17:32:02  <danayo_> YES :)
2019-01-03T17:32:02  <colinclark> Including the community crits
2019-01-03T17:32:50  <colinclark> I had really wanted, before the holidays, to write down some reflections on co-design for 2019 and beyond
2019-01-03T17:32:55  <cherylhjli> that makes a lot of sense colinclark! so anything that would lend itself well to the spirit and action of open participation. and big yes to open studio methods!!
2019-01-03T17:33:27  <colinclark> yup, exactly cherylhjli
2019-01-03T17:33:45  <colinclark> I'm really interested in ways that we can experiment with shifting away from workshop-style events to more day-to-day practices
2019-01-03T17:34:26  <danayo_> that reminds me colinclark: cherylhjli and I were thinking that a good way to gather feedback on the platform.coop site re-design would be to hold a crit to which we invite all the folks who participated in the survey - once we have some mockups to share with them
2019-01-03T17:34:43  <danayo_> as well as solicit their feedback through email
2019-01-03T17:34:45  <colinclark> that's a great idea
2019-01-03T17:34:55  <colinclark> it'll be interesting, too ;)
2019-01-03T17:35:27  <danayo_> definitely
2019-01-03T17:35:51  <colinclark> cherylhjli: This paper that Dana and I wrote gets at a few of these kinds of issues, though it's not particularly detailed: https://github.com/colinbdclark/papers/blob/master/hcii-2016/hcii-2016.pdf
2019-01-03T17:36:29  <colinclark> and Bosmon
2019-01-03T17:36:45  <colinclark> he wrote the "technology" section at the end
2019-01-03T17:37:11  <cherylhjli> thanks for sharing! :)

2019-01-03T17:58:44  <danayo_> cherylhjli: also wanted to say that the content of your "bring it alive" doc looks great
2019-01-03T17:59:04  <danayo_> and I had a look at your owncloud file re-org
2019-01-03T17:59:32  <danayo_> one thing I think I'd like to change is rather than organiing things under "co-design sessions", or perhaps in addition to that, is that we have folders for all the different partners
2019-01-03T18:00:10  <cherylhjli> right, because not all work with partners is exclusively co-design?
2019-01-03T18:01:17  <danayo_> well, it is, hopefully :) but it's more that, for example, I found that the SEWA website design files got a bit buried under the co-design folder
2019-01-03T18:02:08  <cherylhjli> ahhhh
2019-01-03T18:02:36  <cherylhjli> yes, of course. If you'd like you can just go ahead and move it around to what makes sense to you!
2019-01-03T18:02:37  <danayo_> I think it would work better if we had a folder for each partner, and then sub-folders for co-design notes, mockups (maybe) ...
2019-01-03T18:02:46  <danayo_> sure, I can do that
2019-01-03T18:03:00  <cherylhjli> thanks :)
2019-01-03T18:03:34  <cherylhjli> Also, if you have a chance take a peek at the prioritization spreadsheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqLDM-9nwYsDqWboYnsDV1PyeM147-PUlpRok-5AXJw/edit?usp=sharing
2019-01-03T18:03:52  <danayo_> ok
2019-01-03T18:03:55  <danayo_> will do
2019-01-03T18:04:08  <danayo_> also cherylhjli if you have any questions about posting to the wiki don't hesitate to ask
2019-01-03T18:04:08  <cherylhjli> I've just put my best guess at what the priorities for users are… but again, feel free to change things around :)
2019-01-03T18:04:21  <cherylhjli> danayo - will do!

2019-01-03T18:57:14  <danayo> emailed it to you cherylhjli
2019-01-03T18:57:25  <cherylhjli> thank you danayo!
2019-01-03T18:57:43  <danayo> I've made a few changes to the spreadsheet - so far mostly re-naming it as well as re-labelling some of the columns- for clarity
2019-01-03T18:58:29  <danayo> cherylhjli ^
2019-01-03T18:58:41  <cherylhjli> looks great!
2019-01-03T18:59:07  <danayo> I think we'll probably also need to discuss feasibilty from a content perspective - what will be ready to post on the stie
2019-01-03T18:59:10  <danayo> *site
2019-01-03T19:01:54  <danayo> cherylhjli, colinclark: are you getting a message that the host has another meeting in progress?
2019-01-03T19:01:59  <colinclark> yup
2019-01-03T19:02:02  <danayo> cool
2019-01-03T19:02:06  <colinclark> We were in, and then we got kicked out
2019-01-03T19:02:10  <danayo> oops
2019-01-03T19:02:28  <cherylhjli> hmmmm, ended again?
2019-01-03T19:02:30  <colinclark> and again :)
2019-01-03T19:02:33  <cherylhjli> haha
2019-01-03T19:02:34  <danayo> oh dear
2019-01-03T19:39:05  <colinclark> cherylhjli, danayo: I think this might be the contributors list Trebor is referring to: http://platformcoop.newschool.edu/index.php/contributors/
2019-01-03T19:40:23  <colinclark> when he mentioned "another site"
2019-01-03T20:16:24  <cherylhjli> danayo, want to debrief in 5?
