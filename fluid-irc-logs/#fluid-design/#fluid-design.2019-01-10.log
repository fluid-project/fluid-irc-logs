2019-01-10T17:09:27  <cherylhjli> danayo, michelled, colinclark: this is the clickeable prototype I put together with the wires. Hoping to show this to Trebor later. If you click around and find anything that doesn't work please let me know! :)
2019-01-10T17:09:29  <cherylhjli> https://invis.io/JMPX498CW7H#/340267216_01-Landing_Page
2019-01-10T17:14:21  <danayo> thanks cherylhjli, taking a look now
2019-01-10T17:14:42  <cherylhjli> I believe there's also a commenting feature on invision, so feel free to leave comments there.
2019-01-10T17:16:00  <danayo> I don't see a way to comment when I open it in Chrome cherylhjli
2019-01-10T17:16:11  <danayo> but I can just make some notes
2019-01-10T17:17:13  <cherylhjli> Try clicking "0 comments" on the bottom right corner - that should activate the comment mode. (I know, it's so hard to find...)
2019-01-10T17:17:42  <danayo> ah I see it cherylhjli
2019-01-10T17:17:50  <danayo> it comes up really small for me, so I have to zoom way in
2019-01-10T17:18:01  <danayo> so I missed that
2019-01-10T17:18:27  <cherylhjli> Yikes! That sucks. I'll be sure to call it out. :\

2019-01-10T17:20:11  <danayo> I see that you've prioritized "Join a coop" on the landing page cherylhjli, assuming that was intentional? It will be a good point to discuss today I think
2019-01-10T17:20:27  <cherylhjli> yes, that was intentional. We should definitely discuss that today!

2019-01-10T17:24:01  <danayo> also cherylhjli, when you send it out more widely I think it would be good to note some of the limitations of the prototype for clarity - like the fact that you can't open multiple menu items at once - just to avoid any unnecessary discussion about the interaction

2019-01-10T17:28:21  <cherylhjli> great idea danayo!
2019-01-10T17:28:54  <cherylhjli> I'm also hoping to share this process diagram with Trebor and Michael. Not sure if they know this already but I think it'd help them get a sense of when we'll be getting to what design activities. https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/4uGuO7oUbc8jkJy
2019-01-10T17:29:02  <cherylhjli> again, feedback is super welcome!

2019-01-10T18:01:19  <danayo> cherylhjli: re: your process diagram, I can see how it might be helpful in communicating a general process to the team
2019-01-10T18:01:37  <danayo> but more generally it might be good to capture a little more flexibility in the process
2019-01-10T18:02:04  <danayo> for example - at the IDRC anyway - developers might well be involved at step 2
2019-01-10T18:02:36  <danayo> or elsewhere
2019-01-10T18:03:31  <danayo> especially too when we're considering accessibility
2019-01-10T18:04:15  <danayo> I think there is more back and forth and discussion in that regard
2019-01-10T18:05:39  <cherylhjli> yes! I wonder if it's worth saying that this diagram is just the steps, but in terms of the people involved, they can be at any / all stages.
