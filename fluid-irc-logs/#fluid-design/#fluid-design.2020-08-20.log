2020-08-20T15:04:01  <alanharnum> Hi Cheryl we are just downstairs
2020-08-20T15:17:43  <cindyli> Uttara: at Monday's check in, you mentioned there are new svgs for 3 tiles on the wecount website. are they ready?
2020-08-20T15:18:23  <cindyli> sorry, i mean for 3 tiles on the wecount website home page
2020-08-20T15:18:27  <Uttara> cindyli: No havent gotten to working on that yet. I will let u know once they are done
2020-08-20T15:18:36  <cindyli> ok. thanks
2020-08-20T16:13:40  <danayo> cherylhjli: re: weighted stack, I was also thinking that being comfortable with silence is important, as I have found that quieter folks sometimes speak up if that space is provided
2020-08-20T16:13:55  <danayo> and also providing a number of different ways to contribute, other than speaking
2020-08-20T16:14:19  <greatislander> +1 danayo
2020-08-20T16:16:14  <cherylhjli> for sure danayo! silence is so improtant
2020-08-20T16:16:18  <cherylhjli> important*
2020-08-20T16:16:44  <cherylhjli> my partner is in this online writing group and it's super cute because sometimes she doesn't feel like speaking, but she'll type, and someone in the group will read out what she's saying
2020-08-20T16:16:56  <danayo> :)
2020-08-20T16:17:02  <cherylhjli> I find it difficult to multi-task sometimes, so it's always helpful when it's in a larger zoom room when multiple ppl can keep an eye on the chat
2020-08-20T16:17:09  <colinclark> oh, that’s a great point
2020-08-20T16:17:13  <colinclark> silence
2020-08-20T16:17:18  <danayo> and I should say maybe that it’s not about being comfortable with silence, but sitting with the discomfort!
2020-08-20T16:17:19  <colinclark> and multiple ways to contribute
2020-08-20T16:17:38  <colinclark> different things also have different power to communicate
2020-08-20T16:17:48  <colinclark> a work of art is so different from a speech or a panel talk :)
2020-08-20T16:17:57  <danayo> for sure colinclark
2020-08-20T16:18:13  <colinclark> i love when people are sketching pictures in their notebooks during an event, and share it
2020-08-20T16:18:19  <danayo> yes!
2020-08-20T16:18:30  <danayo> cherylhjli: also agree about multi-tasking with the zoom chat
2020-08-20T16:18:35  <danayo> I find that challenging
2020-08-20T16:18:50  <colinclark> Serveral of our Bodies in Translation events had an official illustrator participating
2020-08-20T16:19:10  <danayo> oh nice
