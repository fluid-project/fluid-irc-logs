2019-12-05T18:17:38  <danayo> greatislander: looking at PR#78 and wondering - when is a link (or button etc) in active/pressed state but not focused? it looks like focus moves to the link/button as soon as it’s pressed, right? I don’t see an active state happening with the links…
2019-12-05T18:18:02  <greatislander> danayo it varies from browser to browser— which one are you using?
2019-12-05T18:18:06  <danayo> (referencing the state table)
2019-12-05T18:18:08  <danayo> ah ok
2019-12-05T18:18:10  <danayo> I’m in Chrome
2019-12-05T18:18:18  <danayo> I’ll try others
2019-12-05T18:18:21  <greatislander> I think Chrome focuses on click— hang on
2019-12-05T18:18:53  <greatislander> Yeah Safari doesn't focus when the link is active

2019-12-05T21:33:00  <gmoss> ping jhung
2019-12-05T21:33:09  <jhung> hey gmoss
2019-12-05T21:33:28  <gmoss> jhung: do you know if there's a shared notes doc for the design crit we did on September 17th?
2019-12-05T21:33:55  <gmoss> I didn't put a link in my notes and I don't see one on the Design Crit wiki page
2019-12-05T21:34:54  <jhung> gmoss I'
2019-12-05T21:35:08  <jhung> I'm taking a look at my Google Docs to see if I took any notes.
2019-12-05T21:35:18  <gmoss> jhung: thanks! I wasn't able to find anything in my Drive
2019-12-05T21:35:36  <gmoss> I took notes in OneNote, so if there's nothing then I'll make a new doc and link it to the Design Crit page
2019-12-05T21:35:53  <gmoss> but I was hoping to integrate them into an existing doc, if possible :)
2019-12-05T21:36:18  <jhung> gmoss I just searched - I don't have anything.
