2020-09-15T17:08:09  <cindyli> Justin_o: when you have time, could you do me a favour to test this page with safari: https://deploy-preview-378--wecount.netlify.app/initiatives/recsgefszz0nhe2qg/. i wonder if you can reproduce this issue - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/378#issuecomment-692705894
2020-09-15T17:08:27  <cindyli> i know you are in a meeting right now. no rush. thanks.
2020-09-15T17:08:51  <Justin_o> cindyli: will do.. opening them up in a new window so I won't forget

2020-09-15T17:17:22  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2020-09-15T17:29:32  <Justin_o> cindyli: seems the same issue on iPhone SE and iPhone 8 sizes
2020-09-15T17:30:16  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. Teddy___, fyi ^
2020-09-15T17:38:49  <Bosmon> Hey cindyli, philip - so my nagging netlify-pre-insight just came into focus as I was playing trains with Binghams
2020-09-15T17:39:13  <Bosmon> I think we can attempt to massively abuse netlify's "pull request preview build" functionality to build our entire architecture on : P
2020-09-15T17:39:37  <Bosmon> Given that we already verified that Github's API is sufficiently rich to allow us to create synthetic pull requests
2020-09-15T17:39:52  <Bosmon> Sorry to talk in the wrong channel, follups to #fluid-tech : P
2020-09-15T19:36:34  <cindyli> Teddy___: can you review my pull request when you have a chance - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/393. thanks
2020-09-15T19:39:09  <Teddy___> Yup currently in the middle of that
2020-09-15T19:40:34  <cindyli> thanks
2020-09-15T19:41:49  <Teddy___> Uttara: cindyli I feel like the purple can be more purple right now it looks very similar to the blue tile colour. I want to know what you guys think?
2020-09-15T19:42:16  <Uttara> Teddy__ Thanks let me have a quick look
2020-09-15T19:42:40  <Uttara> I dont see it on the dev website yet Teddy__
2020-09-15T19:43:11  <Teddy___> It hasn't been merged to the dev site yet. I am currently reviewing it
2020-09-15T19:43:24  <Teddy___> you can check it out at the deploy preview here: https://deploy-preview-393--wecount.netlify.app/
2020-09-15T19:44:53  <cindyli> Teddy___: "purple" is just the name I use. i agree the svg is actually another shade of blue ;)
2020-09-15T19:56:41  <cindyli> Teddy___: when you finish the review, can you start to test the whole website in preparation for the next release. I will work on this issue - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/391. this issue will affect the initiatives page, so please skip this page during testing. but its subsequent comment page is not affected and can be tested.
2020-09-15T19:57:24  <cindyli> as usual, make sure to test: 1. across browser; 2. various screen sizes; 3. all UIO settings
2020-09-15T20:15:34  <Teddy___> Okay sound good cindyli
