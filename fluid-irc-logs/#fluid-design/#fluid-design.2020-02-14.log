2020-02-14T15:41:24  <sepidehshahi> Hi danielcho I have updated the labels in figma
2020-02-14T15:41:44  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: thank you for the quick update!
2020-02-14T15:42:13  <sepidehshahi> danielcho: in 0.3 final design we don’t have Delete all button. It’s more of a refresh/restart button. did you mean that button doesn’t have enough contrast?
2020-02-14T15:42:39  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: I was talking about the current design for the delete all button
2020-02-14T15:42:58  <danielcho> one used on the production site: http://build.codelearncreate.org/
2020-02-14T15:43:32  <danielcho> ^ simonjb, should we talk about 0.3 tasks when you have time?

2020-02-14T15:49:50  <sepidehshahi> danielcho: I have made the changes - A0311F passes the contrast requirement
2020-02-14T15:50:09  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: thank you :)
