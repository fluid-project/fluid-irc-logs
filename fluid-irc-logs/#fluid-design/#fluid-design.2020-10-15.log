2020-10-15T12:17:52  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o, I've reworked the stylesheet processing to use Webpack as well. I think it's a lot more flexible. PR is here: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/37
2020-10-15T12:22:56  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks, I'll try to review that today
2020-10-15T13:17:56  * greatislander takes dog for a walk
2020-10-15T14:37:39  <greatislander> Justin_o do you have a moment for a call?
2020-10-15T14:37:50  <greatislander> Oh, never mind, I just remembered you are at the GSoC thing.
2020-10-15T14:38:13  <Justin_o> GSoC starts at 11 but I'm sitting in the wecount call right now. I think I can break away from that though.
2020-10-15T14:38:16  <Justin_o> greatislander:
2020-10-15T14:38:18  <Justin_o> greatislander: ^
2020-10-15T14:38:26  <greatislander> okay. General room?
2020-10-15T14:38:45  <Justin_o> sure
2020-10-15T17:02:05  <danayo> cherylhjli: sepidehshahi and I are in the daily connections room, are you somewhere else?
2020-10-15T17:03:09  <michelled> oh, I thought it was the general room?
2020-10-15T17:03:12  <michelled> I'll come there
2020-10-15T17:35:46  <Justin_o> greatislander: I'm running into an odd issue with the fluid-11ty PR for style processing. https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/37#discussion_r505720322
2020-10-15T17:36:17  <greatislander> Justin_o I just saw your comment. Can you give me steps to reproduce, e.g. what the source files are when you encounter this issue?
2020-10-15T17:51:24  <Justin_o> greatislander: I just made new files in the styles.assets directory nothing major.. I started off by just adding back the files that you removed for styl and scss with new names..
2020-10-15T17:51:44  <Justin_o> then I just added some .css files named things like "test", "other" etc.. just random names really.
2020-10-15T17:51:55  <greatislander> Did you do that while running `start`?
2020-10-15T17:51:58  <Justin_o> they just included simple things like styling the background-colour and etc.
2020-10-15T17:52:13  <greatislander> or did you modify the src/assets/styles content, then run start or build?
2020-10-15T17:52:32  <Justin_o> I used `npm start` but I did just shut down the server and restarted instead of relying on browser sync, which seemed to have problems if I changed the file name by the wya.
2020-10-15T17:53:15  <greatislander> Yeah, you can't add and remove files in assets while webpack is running. When it starts it globs the files so if you change them it won't pick up changes.
2020-10-15T17:54:29  <Justin_o> greatislander: yes.. so I did stop and restart the server and the files weren't picked up.. I even tried that multiple times without changing files and same issue.
2020-10-15T17:54:38  <greatislander> hmm
2020-10-15T17:55:18  <greatislander> I'm heads down on ILDH conversion to Eleventy right now but will look later.
2020-10-15T17:55:48  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks
