2020-04-06T16:09:56  <gmoss> danielcho: the Storytelling Tool has a custom-styled checkbox, but it doesn't work across all browsers. If you have a good solution it would be great to know more! :)
2020-04-06T16:10:47  <danielcho> gmoss: do you have a link to the source code? I would like to see it as well :)
2020-04-06T16:12:25  <greatislander> gmoss danielcho we had to make a custom checkbox for Pinecone (Platform Co-op) as well! Maybe we could all compare notes!
2020-04-06T16:12:35  <cherylhjli> coop check in?
2020-04-06T16:12:41  <greatislander> yep, give me a moment
2020-04-06T16:12:44  <gmoss> danielcho: here's what I came up with, not the most elegant solution: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/themes/base/css/storyTelling.css#L304-L314
2020-04-06T16:12:51  <gmoss> greatislander: yeah that would be awesome!
2020-04-06T16:14:01  <greatislander> cool, maybe let's schedule a time tomorrow if you are both available
2020-04-06T16:14:15  <danayo> cherylhjli: just need a minute
2020-04-06T16:15:39  <gmoss> danielcho, greatislander: so my solution is basically "make it X units wide and move it X/2 units to put it back in the original position". it doesn't work in Firefox, notably
2020-04-06T16:16:25  <gmoss> danielcho, greatislander: tomorrow is good for me any time outside of Planning or a Crit if there is one.
2020-04-06T16:16:30  <greatislander> okay cool
2020-04-06T16:16:34  <greatislander> I will send an invite
2020-04-06T16:16:39  <gmoss> awesome, thanks :)
2020-04-06T16:16:51  <greatislander> Is there a crit tomorrow Justin_o?
2020-04-06T16:18:15  <Justin_o> greatislander: I don't think so. I don't see anything schedule either https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=79560733
2020-04-06T16:18:19  <gmoss> jhung would generally be the one handing that, greatislander, and the new policy was not to send a cancellation email if there wasn't one. I haven't seen one mentioned
2020-04-06T16:18:24  <greatislander> ah okay cool
2020-04-06T16:18:32  <greatislander> so maybe crit time gmoss danielcho?
2020-04-06T16:18:52  <gmoss> greatislander: works for me :) if there ends up being a crit we can always reconvene
2020-04-06T16:20:15  <Justin_o> greatislander, gmoss, danielcho: you could even propose that as the crit topic
2020-04-06T16:20:23  <greatislander> oh that's true!
2020-04-06T16:21:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: not a bad idea :)
2020-04-06T16:22:12  <gmoss> seems like a pretty low-pressure crit topic
2020-04-06T16:22:47  <gmoss> not that I ever felt there were any particularly high-pressure crit topics, of course :) but it seems straightforward, and I'd be happy to talk about my work
2020-04-06T16:22:53  <gmoss> it just might only last a few minutes

2020-04-06T16:53:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: maybe something like "We will be discussing approaches for HTML checkbox custom styling and browser compatibility". danielcho, greatislander: do you have any thoughts?
2020-04-06T16:54:05  <greatislander> That sounds great, and maybe mention that we will be comparing/contrasting approaches from the Storytelling Tool, the Platform Co-op Development Kit, and C2LC?
2020-04-06T16:55:12  <michelled> danielcho, simonjb: did you want to check in today? or simonjb are you heads down with Kettle?
2020-04-06T16:55:45  <simonjb> michelled: I'm happy to check in on C2LC
2020-04-06T16:55:46  <danielcho> gmoss: I can't say what I implemented is a checkbox though — I implemented a checkbox like component with a toggle buttons with react state
2020-04-06T16:56:02  <danielcho> michelled: sure I am happy to checkin as well
2020-04-06T16:56:26  <michelled> great, we can meet at 1 danielcho, simonjb
2020-04-06T16:56:36  <danielcho> sounds good, talk to you soon!
2020-04-06T16:56:41  <michelled> gmoss: have you had a storytelling checkin today?
2020-04-06T16:57:04  <gmoss> danielcho: I think it would be interesting to compare your approach and results with those of greatislander and me :)
2020-04-06T16:57:05  <gmoss> michelled: not yet!
2020-04-06T16:57:18  <gmoss> michelled: I'm good any time you and cindyli are :)
2020-04-06T16:57:34  <michelled> I can ping you both when I'm done my c2lc check in
2020-04-06T16:57:54  <danielcho> gmoss: sure, I am happy to share my approach :)
2020-04-06T16:58:25  <Justin_o> greatislander, gmoss: thanks
2020-04-06T16:58:36  <danielcho> so yeah, I think what you initially suggested as a topic with greatislander suggestion would be a good title topic for the chat
2020-04-06T16:59:08  <simonjb> michelled, danielcho: would you be okay with us doing our C2LC check in on skype? I can create a group for us
2020-04-06T16:59:23  <michelled> sure
2020-04-06T16:59:25  <danielcho> simonjb: sure, I am fine with that
2020-04-06T17:02:02  <gmoss> michelled, cindyli: I'll be afk for the next half hour or so
2020-04-06T17:03:11  <cindyli> ok

2020-04-06T17:58:17  <danayo> jhung, erictheise could we meet at 10 after the hour?
2020-04-06T17:58:39  <jhung> danayo, erictheise - works for me.
2020-04-06T17:59:33  <erictheise> sure.
2020-04-06T18:00:28  <cherylhjli> sure
2020-04-06T18:04:09  <lliskovoi____> cindyli, Teddy___ greatislander, the hover/focus styles for pagination are now on Figma below the Style guide
2020-04-06T18:04:33  <Teddy___> Awesome
2020-04-06T18:04:34  <cindyli> thanks, lliskovoi____
2020-04-06T18:09:07  <cherylhjli> jhung danayo greatislander - just saw that there's a design crit tomorrow, let's move our accessibility meeting for the tool lib? maybe to 12:30-1:30?
2020-04-06T18:09:57  <danayo> we’d have to move the arch meeting too cherylhjli
2020-04-06T18:09:57  <jhung> cherylhjli I totally did not catch that during our checkin earlier. *sigh*
2020-04-06T18:10:53  <cherylhjli> arch meeting is 3:30-4:30 so it doesn't overlap, unless we think its too many meetings for 1 day
2020-04-06T18:13:13  <danayo> sorry cherylhjli time zone confusion!
2020-04-06T18:14:52  <danayo> cherylhjli: 12:30 ET works for me
2020-04-06T18:15:06  <cherylhjli> jhung greatislander we're in the zoom room!
2020-04-06T18:26:53  <greatislander> cheryhjli I have a We Count meeting, sorry! so many meetings

2020-04-06T20:31:44  <greatislander> Hi Teddy___, I added a bit more CSS-based styling for those SVGs in https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/130/commits/db82c4e303b3a9cd4282f7d3d5ffb98aceb1716e
2020-04-06T20:31:52  <greatislander> I'm going to approve and merge the PR now :)
2020-04-06T20:31:59  <greatislander> But take a look to see what I did
2020-04-06T20:32:12  <Teddy___> Okay I'll check it out
2020-04-06T20:32:17  <Teddy___> thank you
2020-04-06T20:43:04  <greatislander> cindyli Teddy___ I found one more blocker:
2020-04-06T20:44:02  <greatislander> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/PfLoJl3m/caption.mp4
2020-04-06T20:44:31  <greatislander> Colour contrast is insufficient for the caption, and it has a weird hover style which I don't think it should since it isn't interactive.
2020-04-06T20:46:38  <greatislander> https://whocanuse.com/?b=ffffff&c=dddddd&f=12
2020-04-06T20:46:53  <cindyli> good catch, greatislander. let's tackle it.
2020-04-06T20:47:02  <greatislander> Opening a ticket cindyli
2020-04-06T20:47:31  <cindyli> ok. thanks.
2020-04-06T20:48:02  <cindyli> lliskovoi____ may have idea of what color captions should use
2020-04-06T20:48:38  <greatislander> I believe she's in a meeting. My instinct is that we should use the standard body text colour and leave it as a smaller font size.
2020-04-06T20:48:47  <greatislander> We can always return to this later to adjust.
2020-04-06T20:49:47  <lliskovoi____> I think either standard body text or #465D8B if we want to have a bit more of an accent
2020-04-06T20:50:19  <cindyli> thanks, lliskovoi____
2020-04-06T20:50:31  <cindyli> greatislander: is the caption a part of the content from wordpress api, does it have a wordpress css class associated? shall we re-define these classes in we count like what we did for images in contents?
2020-04-06T20:51:18  <cindyli> ok, see your issue ticket. now i know where to look
2020-04-06T20:54:23  <cindyli> got it. the color is what we inherited from Wordpress - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/master/assets/css/layout/_layout.scss#L67
2020-04-06T20:54:31  <cindyli> hover styling at line 76 too
2020-04-06T20:54:50  <Teddy___> Yes
2020-04-06T20:55:11  <Teddy___> is the answer to all of those
2020-04-06T20:55:21  <greatislander> That's from the WordPress theme we installed on the WordPress site, but that doesn't mean it's good :)
2020-04-06T20:55:50  <Teddy___> Yeah we can always change it
2020-04-06T20:56:20  <Teddy___> I put  comment " Default WP Alignment Classes" in the _layout.scss file
2020-04-06T20:56:37  <Teddy___> classes underneath are wordpress css classes
2020-04-06T20:57:57  <greatislander> Where did you get those from in WordPress, Teddy___?
2020-04-06T20:57:59  <greatislander> Just curious
2020-04-06T20:58:19  <greatislander> I'm seeing this:
2020-04-06T20:58:24  <greatislander> ```
2020-04-06T20:58:24  <greatislander> font-size: 1.5rem;
2020-04-06T20:58:24  <greatislander> font-weight: 500;
2020-04-06T20:58:24  <greatislander> line-height: 1.2;
2020-04-06T20:58:24  <greatislander> ```
2020-04-06T20:58:33  <greatislander> (In the theme we are using on the WordPress side)
2020-04-06T20:58:40  <greatislander> It's not a big deal but I am curious
2020-04-06T21:00:40  <Teddy___> got them from the links you in last Wednesdays check-in:
2020-04-06T21:00:42  <Teddy___> https://gist.github.com/jlengstorf/5043207
2020-04-06T21:00:53  <Teddy___> https://codex.wordpress.org/Styling_Images_in_Posts_and_Pages
2020-04-06T21:01:13  <greatislander> Those were for the alignment classes
2020-04-06T21:01:17  <greatislander> Not the caption styling
2020-04-06T21:01:25  <greatislander> But thanks for clarifying
2020-04-06T21:01:48  <Teddy___> np, I ended using it for both

2020-04-06T21:43:17  <greatislander> yeah!
2020-04-06T21:43:37  <greatislander> hi colinclark
2020-04-06T21:43:46  <greatislander> I'm wondering if there
2020-04-06T21:43:50  <greatislander> oops
2020-04-06T21:44:12  <colinclark> hey greatislander
2020-04-06T21:44:13  <greatislander> if there's a tweet-length description of We Count anywhere that you know if. Working on adding meta info to the site for SEO etc.
2020-04-06T21:44:21  <colinclark> hmm
2020-04-06T21:44:25  <colinclark> that’s a good question
2020-04-06T21:44:40  <colinclark> i think actually the feds usually ask for a one sentence summary of the project at the top of the proposal
2020-04-06T21:44:43  <colinclark> let me see what I have
2020-04-06T21:44:49  <greatislander> "We Count, a project of the Inclusive Design Research Centre, works to remove bias and exclusion within the data economy."
2020-04-06T21:44:57  <greatislander> That's what I came up with based on site content
2020-04-06T21:45:07  <greatislander> For Google etc. it needs to be < 160 characters
2020-04-06T21:45:10  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-04-06T21:46:51  <colinclark> lol, classic Jutta
2020-04-06T21:46:58  <colinclark> “In 2-3 sentences provide a succinct, high-level summary of your projects main objectives and deliverables.”
2020-04-06T21:47:10  <colinclark> Project We Count will address barriers to participation and employment for persons with disabilities in the rapidly growing data economy. At the same time, the project will tackle bias and exclusion of persons with disabilities in data systems and ensure that these systems (including artificial intelligence, smart technologies, data-driven decision making and data analytics) recognize, understand and serv
2020-04-06T21:47:10  <colinclark> disabilities by creating innovative machine learning strategies and addressing data gaps. Project We Count will increase knowledge, establish skills, develop inclusive data tools and create a forum whereby the Canadian disability community can help shape the rapidly evolving data economy in more inclusive directions.
2020-04-06T21:47:17  <colinclark> I’m not 100% sure that will fit in a tweet
2020-04-06T21:47:21  <greatislander> same lol
2020-04-06T21:47:32  <greatislander> Project We Count will address barriers to participation and employment for persons with disabilities in the rapidly growing data economy
2020-04-06T21:47:37  <greatislander> That seems like a good start?
2020-04-06T21:47:42  <greatislander> I dunno, we can always edit
2020-04-06T21:47:52  <greatislander> I just need something relatively descriptive
2020-04-06T21:50:38  <greatislander> "We Count works to address barriers to participation and employment for persons with disabilities in the rapidly growing data economy."

2020-04-06T21:59:21  <colinclark> seems reasonable
2020-04-06T21:59:40  <colinclark> if it’s for SEO we may want some key words like inclusive and artificial intelligence in there too?
2020-04-06T22:02:45  <greatislander> Yeah true
