2020-05-26T15:30:44  <cherylhjli> hey michelled, is there any chance we can push back iteration planning next week to 2pm eastern? danayo, colinclark, and I are trying to meet with Greg Brodsky from start.coop at 1
2020-05-26T15:56:21  <michelled> for sure cherylhjli!
2020-05-26T15:57:11  <danayo> michelled, cindyli, gmoss can we have storytelling standup right after planning?
2020-05-26T15:57:22  <cherylhjli> thanks michelled!
2020-05-26T15:57:25  <gmoss> danayo: works for me if it works for michelled and cindyli
2020-05-26T15:57:32  <gmoss> :)
2020-05-26T15:57:34  <cindyli> danayo: i have a call with Justin and Ted after this
2020-05-26T15:57:39  <michelled> danayo: I need a short break - I've been in non-stop meetings since 9:30
2020-05-26T15:58:04  <danayo> ok cindyli, michelled, gmoss, let’s keep it at 12:30 then
2020-05-26T15:58:10  <gmoss> sounds good!
2020-05-26T15:58:12  <cindyli> sure
2020-05-26T16:00:05  <cindyli> greatislander: i wonder if you have time to review my pull rquest - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/238. merging it requires the approval from at least one person with write permission to the repo, and I cannot approve my own pull request ;) If you don't have time, i will ask for Justin_o's help
2020-05-26T16:00:41  <michelled> cindyli: for websites we don't hold to that rule
2020-05-26T16:01:00  <michelled> we get code review if we feel we'd like some, but otherwise, we've been merging our own pull requests
2020-05-26T16:04:06  <cindyli> michelled: if so, i will use my admin privilege to merge it once it passes Teddy___'s review. good to know it's not an abuse of the admin priv ;)
2020-05-26T16:05:28  <Teddy___> ahaha
2020-05-26T16:05:28  <greatislander> done cindyli

2020-05-26T16:15:12  <jhung> cherylhjli danayo greatislander can we start the filters chat in 15 (12:30ET)?
2020-05-26T16:15:46  <greatislander> I think danayo is busy with a storytelling meeting
2020-05-26T16:15:54  <greatislander> so we may need to push it back a bit jhung
2020-05-26T16:16:25  <jhung> Ok.
2020-05-26T16:17:50  <jhung> Just heads up that I'll be AFK around 2:30p to 3:30p. But you all can start and I'll just as soon as I can.
2020-05-26T16:18:31  <greatislander> I think cherylhjli was suggesting we meet at 1:15 or so. is that right, cherylhjli ?
2020-05-26T16:20:32  <cherylhjli> yep! danayo and I will check in quickly at 1 about them, and then once we figure a few things out we'll ping you - probably around 1:15-1:30
2020-05-26T16:22:39  <greatislander> okay, thanks

2020-05-26T16:23:44  <colinclark> gmoss, danayo: One point of clarification, regarding the Storytelling Tool...
2020-05-26T16:23:57  <colinclark> I don’t think we need to (or should) drop everything to work on things like story reordering
2020-05-26T16:24:06  <colinclark> I think the key is to be accountable to the roadmap
2020-05-26T16:24:28  <colinclark> which involves dropping any distractions and focusing on the plan
2020-05-26T16:24:38  <colinclark> finishing up what’s in progress and then moving on to the next highest priority
2020-05-26T16:25:11  <colinclark> and having clear timelines for the missing features that are causing some pain, making sure we can meet those deadlines, and communicating them clearly
2020-05-26T16:26:49  <danayo> thanks colinclark, right now the estimate for autosave work takes us to June 15
2020-05-26T16:26:53  <gmoss> colinclark: fair enough. so, to be clear, we should continue work on the autosave feature (as we've prioritized it), and once that's wrapped up we should move onto the next highest priorities, which by the sounds of it should be the reordering and then editing
2020-05-26T16:27:34  <danayo> it sounded to me like Jutta wanted the other issues addressed sooner than that
2020-05-26T16:29:14  <colinclark> are there some other things we can not do in order to focus on this work, gmoss?
2020-05-26T16:31:02  <gmoss> colinclark: as in are there tasks in the SJRK-289 work we could shelve in order to wrap it up sooner? In that case, if we want, I can leave the duplication I was cutting out, I can allow previewing and publishing during file upload (I recommend against this), I can leave the test coverage as it is (present, but lacking), and I can postpone the docs updates
2020-05-26T16:31:45  <gmoss> the tasks that remain are detailed here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-289?focusedCommentId=41525&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-41525
2020-05-26T16:33:18  <michelled> gmoss, danayo: let's use the floe room for storytelling today
2020-05-26T16:33:39  <danayo> ok michelled
2020-05-26T16:33:40  <gmoss> michelled: okay, sounds good!
2020-05-26T16:34:11  <gmoss> michelled: could you share the room ID with me, please? I don't have it handy
2020-05-26T16:34:30  <danayo> me too please michelled
2020-05-26T16:34:35  <michelled> https://ocadu.zoom.us/j/571057718?pwd=Y0pVanNjU0RndnduYVdISFBBRzY4QT09
2020-05-26T16:37:58  <gmoss> colinclark: would you like to join us right now, if you have time?
2020-05-26T16:38:18  <colinclark> I’m in a meeting
2020-05-26T16:38:50  <colinclark> gmoss: I was suggesting instead, are there tasks that aren’t related to the Storytelling Tool that you could delegate or avoid?
2020-05-26T16:54:37  <danayo> colinclark, it sounds like the June 15 date for autosave can’t move
2020-05-26T16:54:50  <danayo> In that case, my call would be to switch gears to the things that have come up in the AIHEC workshops

2020-05-26T17:26:13  <jhung> cherylhjli I opened a PR for the inline link styles. See https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/pull/358
2020-05-26T17:26:54  <jhung> greatislander going to look into the other 2 PRs now.
2020-05-26T17:28:30  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-05-26T17:29:40  <gmoss> colinclark: sorry, didn't mean to leave your question hanging, we were in the middle of discussing the matter. The only tasks I could clear off my plate to make more room for ST things would be GSoC and attending Community Meetings and the like, hence the estimated delivery date not being movable.
2020-05-26T17:29:40  <gmoss> For now, I'm going to get the SJRK-289 branch into a place where it's easy to come back to, and then I'll start planning the work on SJRK-288 (block reordering) and will give some thought to how editing could be implemented
2020-05-26T17:38:41  <cherylhjli> greatislander jhung we're good now
2020-05-26T17:38:42  <cherylhjli> coop room?
2020-05-26T17:38:50  <jhung> sure
2020-05-26T17:38:55  <greatislander> gimme a moment
2020-05-26T17:59:22  <cindyli> hi gmoss, is there anything I need to catch up with sjrk check in today?
2020-05-26T18:02:58  <gmoss> cindyli: most of it happened in here haha. The plan right now is to refocus on block reordering, so that involves a little bit of design work followed by estimation, and I'm working on getting SJRK-289 in a place where I can leave it for a while and come back to it without too much difficulty
2020-05-26T18:04:24  <cindyli> great. thanks for the update, gmoss

2020-05-26T20:44:30  <cherylhjli> hey greatislander - danayo and I are trying to figure out the difference between 2nd level coops and coops of coops. We know what 2nd level coops are (when coops band together for a shared common purpose like cobranding, lobbying, etc) but we're a little stumped on what coops of coops are - do you happen to know?
2020-05-26T20:47:02  <greatislander> a coop of coops is a cooperative whose members are cooperatives
2020-05-26T20:47:13  <cherylhjli> so a second level coop is a type of coop of coops?
2020-05-26T20:47:17  <greatislander> yep
2020-05-26T20:47:19  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@207.136.100.151> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-05-26T20:47:45  <cherylhjli> cool! I wonder if it's worth it to just have coop of coops as an option then, danayo? I'm not sure why we would call out second level coop if it's a subgroup of coop of coops
2020-05-26T20:48:31  <greatislander> In your understanding, is a second level co-op always legally structured as a co-op?
2020-05-26T20:48:46  <greatislander> That's how I read your definition
2020-05-26T20:49:39  <greatislander> the other terminology I'm familiar with is federation of co-ops (co-operative federation)
2020-05-26T20:49:41  <cherylhjli> i'm not sure - according to Stephanie it depends on legislation in the region on what a coop of coop / second level coop can or can't be
2020-05-26T20:50:05  <cherylhjli> yeah, I think a federation is the other terminology as well
2020-05-26T20:50:12  <greatislander> e.g. Gujarat State Mahila SEWA Cooperative Federation
2020-05-26T20:51:39  <danayo> greatislander, cherylhjli - my understanding is that a co-op of co-ops (or federation) is the co-op that is the umbrella for all the others (like SEWA), where a 2nd-level co-op would be one of the co-ops in the federation, in which case it seems to me to be a useful distinction
2020-05-26T20:51:56  <greatislander> oh, right
2020-05-26T20:52:12  <greatislander> so a second-level co-op would be a SEWA dairy co-op, for example
2020-05-26T20:52:20  <greatislander> whereas the co-op of co-ops is SEWA itself
2020-05-26T20:52:51  <cherylhjli> oh weird, I thought 1st level was the one who interacted with the members themselves
2020-05-26T20:53:16  <cherylhjli> and 2nd level would be 1st level coops getting together to organize
2020-05-26T20:54:21  <greatislander> danayo is right
2020-05-26T20:54:51  <greatislander> wait no
2020-05-26T20:54:54  <danayo> :p

2020-05-26T20:55:38  <cherylhjli> oh dear
2020-05-26T20:56:00  <greatislander> I think the conclusion here is that we need to table this for the day and review tomorrow morning :)

2020-05-26T20:57:31  <danayo> it was so fun to be right for a minute there :D
2020-05-26T20:57:39  <cherylhjli> hahahah
2020-05-26T20:57:47  <cherylhjli> tomorrow morning sounds good
2020-05-26T20:57:47  <greatislander> lol
2020-05-26T20:58:10  <greatislander> I think the takeaway here is that we should probably use cooperative of cooperatives
2020-05-26T20:58:19  <greatislander> because that explains _what_ it is
2020-05-26T20:58:36  <greatislander> and the specific terminology varies (second-level, second-tier, federation, etc)
2020-05-26T21:03:00  <danayo> that sounds good to me greatislander
2020-05-26T21:05:01  <cherylhjli> ok!
2020-05-26T21:18:38  <gtirloni> erictheise greatislander: I'd like to do the migration tomorrow morning, if that's okay... around 7-9am EDT. Please let me know if there'll be any impediments
2020-05-26T21:25:55  <erictheise> fine with me gtirloni. I will be doing database work tonight but 7-9 Eastern I will be asleep.
2020-05-26T21:30:41  <gtirloni> cool, thanks :)
2020-05-26T21:30:52  <gtirloni> erictheise: if you could send me your public SSH key, I can enable your access tomorrow during the migration
2020-05-26T21:32:31  <erictheise> three possible “gotchas” I can think of gtirloni. 1) need a replacement strategy for EMAIL_BACKEND & DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL in cmdi/settings.py. 2) you should look at settings.py on the AWS server and set ALLOWED_HOSTS for your infrastructure. 3) you might want to generate a new SECRET_KEY.
2020-05-26T21:33:32  <gtirloni> got it
2020-05-26T21:34:29  <erictheise> if you want to migrate later in the morning I can help you with any debugging but if you’re confident, go for it.
2020-05-26T21:35:13  <gtirloni> ok, I think I'll try it and, in the worst case, I just revert the DNS change. You're in Pacific timezone?
2020-05-26T21:35:55  <erictheise> if you switch the domain name demo. and directory.platform.coop can both be up.
2020-05-26T21:36:08  <erictheise> yes, San Francisco/Pacific time.
2020-05-26T21:36:19  <gtirloni> cool
