2020-05-29T15:38:14  <gtirloni> I'm not able to join the Zoom meeting right now, having network issues (on the phone with my ISP). My update is that I was out yesterday, worked on the platform coop directory continuous deployment (github actions and changes to the server). I'll continue to work on that depending how the review goes and if there's some free time I'll look into Matomo to host our own web analytics service
2020-05-29T15:43:08  <cindyli> Teddy___: how is it going with this experiment - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/230#issuecomment-635625344
2020-05-29T15:44:03  <Teddy___> Going good, I did all the testing yesterday and I am writing the final report
2020-05-29T15:44:16  <cindyli> great. thanks, Teddy___
2020-05-29T15:48:52  <jhung> greatislander do we need to checkin today? I don't have anything. I'm reviewing GSOC PRs and other stuff today.
2020-05-29T15:50:54  <greatislander> I could do a quick oneâ€” on a call but I'll ping you after
2020-05-29T15:51:05  <jhung> ok

2020-05-29T16:59:38  <Teddy___> @cindyli the accessibility score has dropped from 100 to 98 because we are now using the `tabindex` attribute to force the tab order of the link in the brand component precede  the uio tab https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GzzxF4pl/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-29%20at%209.55.18%20AM.png
2020-05-29T17:00:18  <Teddy___> currently looking for ways around this
2020-05-29T17:00:44  <cindyli> good catch, Teddy___
2020-05-29T17:02:20  <cindyli> Teddy___: one solution is to place the container for rendering UIO after the wecount logo, so the order of these 2 page elements match their visual order
2020-05-29T17:16:38  <Teddy___> The appearance of the site is faltered when I attempt that
2020-05-29T17:18:09  <Teddy___> @cindyli I am thinking maybe the uio tab should be first in index order because when I user that is need of uio comes to the site that is the first place they would want to go
2020-05-29T17:20:20  <cindyli> Teddy___: the problem is it would be different from the visual order. one of the accessibility rule is non-sighted users who use keyboard should receive the same information as sighted users
2020-05-29T17:20:42  <cindyli> let me give a try on reordering containers
2020-05-29T17:20:46  <Teddy___> right I see
2020-05-29T17:21:02  <Teddy___> I am going to check how the uio demos handle this problem
2020-05-29T17:23:26  <cindyli> ya, good point
2020-05-29T17:44:12  <cindyli> Teddy___: it seems switching containers don't work. on the mobile layout, UIO button is the first visual element and the logo is the 2nd element, which is vice versa with the desktop layout. no matter which element is the first on the page, we run into problems with one layout
2020-05-29T17:44:32  <cindyli> let's use tabindex for now and discuss this issue with Lisa and Justin next time
2020-05-29T17:49:40  <Teddy___> sounds good

2020-05-29T18:34:00  <Teddy___> Okay
2020-05-29T18:34:18  <cindyli> Teddy___: https://helpdeskgeek.com/networking/simulate-slow-internet-connection-testing/
2020-05-29T19:07:25  <cindyli> gtirloni: i got your email. what is Matomo instance?
2020-05-29T19:07:54  <gtirloni> cindyli: it's a replacement for google analytics, see https://matomo.org
2020-05-29T19:08:11  <cindyli> ah. i see. you are fast, gtirloni
2020-05-29T19:08:22  <gtirloni> ours is hosted at https://analytics.inclusivedesign.ca -- I'm writing an email about it right now
2020-05-29T19:08:25  <gtirloni> :)
2020-05-29T19:21:45  <cindyli> gtirloni: in the code you send, is this line correct:
2020-05-29T19:21:46  <cindyli> var u="//analytics.inclusivedesign.ca/";
2020-05-29T19:21:52  <cindyli> without having "https"?
2020-05-29T19:22:46  <gtirloni> I think it's saying that it'll use whatever the website is using, without specifying the protocol. That's okay because we're have a redirect from http to https for all websites
2020-05-29T19:22:47  <cindyli> it generates code like:
2020-05-29T19:22:48  <cindyli> <script type="text/javascript" async="" defer="" src="//analytics.inclusivedesign.ca/matomo.js"></script>
2020-05-29T19:23:39  <cindyli> gtirloni: have a look at the "src" value. i doubt if it would automatically pick up "http" or "https"
2020-05-29T19:24:58  <gtirloni> it should be fine, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#prurl
