2020-01-21T17:04:34  <Teddy__> greatislander
2020-01-21T17:05:06  <greatislander> Yes @Teddy__
2020-01-21T17:05:35  <greatislander> Also, you should address this one as part of your global styling: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/9
2020-01-21T17:07:00  <Teddy__> Okay I will include it in the styling branch
2020-01-21T17:10:21  <cherylhjli> greatislander jhung - we're debriefing the codesign in the platform coop room, you're welcome to join
2020-01-21T17:10:45  <jhung> sure cherylhjli
2020-01-21T17:35:00  <greatislander> oh, forgot to ask: quick poll for coop folks. Should the resource library be:
2020-01-21T17:35:00  <greatislander> A: resources.platform.coop
2020-01-21T17:35:00  <greatislander> B: library.platform.coop
2020-01-21T17:35:01  <greatislander> cherylhjli colinclark danayo jhung michelled ^
2020-01-21T17:35:09  <greatislander> Trebor has no preference :)
2020-01-21T17:35:19  <colinclark> I say A
2020-01-21T17:35:26  <colinclark> but what do others think?
2020-01-21T17:35:36  <cherylhjli> I like A too
2020-01-21T17:35:40  <greatislander> I was thinking B but I have come around to A
2020-01-21T17:36:46  <erictheise> resources is more open-ended which might be good. define 'library' in the dns and do a redirect to it.
2020-01-21T17:36:48  <michelled> I like A - resources feels a bit more expansive
2020-01-21T17:36:49  <danayo> greatislander: I’m waffling, but I think I’d go with A, since I think it reflects the variety of items in the libarry
2020-01-21T17:36:55  <greatislander> :)
2020-01-21T17:37:04  <danayo> yeah what michelled said :)
2020-01-21T17:37:07  <greatislander> A it is!
2020-01-21T17:37:11  <danayo> and erictheise
2020-01-21T17:37:19  <greatislander> And I think there is some value to having an alias from 'Library'
2020-01-21T17:45:23  <gmoss> danayo: I'm about to start work on SJRK-104. I gave it some thought yesterday and briefly conferred with lliskovoi, and I think the interaction will be something like this: from editor page 1 (story blocks), I click "continue" and go to editor page 2 (metadata), then I click the "back" link on the page which would take me back to page 1.
2020-01-21T17:45:23  <gmoss> This would create a browser history entry for each action, so if I hit the browser's "back" button, it would take me to page 2, and one more click would take me back to my original state at page 1. What do you think about this? It would be great to get your input before I forge ahead with developing it :)
2020-01-21T17:45:23  <gmoss> The other option I considered seemed more complicated and less expected, which was to have forward and back take you through the three Editor pages in a more linear and absolute fashion, not relative to what page the user had just been on
2020-01-21T17:45:37  <gmoss> (anyone else, please feel free to weigh in!)
2020-01-21T17:47:00  <danayo> erictheise, greatislander, jhung, cherylhjli I am hoping to set up a meeting with this person who is working on the Australian Visual Atlas of coops as well as a taxonomy of platform coops https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/olivera.marjanovic (re: the email thread from Jan 14).
2020-01-21T17:47:03  <danayo> given the time zone difference I was going to suggest 4pm EST which is 8am for her, one day next week, Mon-Thurs. Do you want to join that meeting and are there any days that work best for you?
2020-01-21T17:47:13  <danayo> and does that time work for you?
2020-01-21T17:47:31  <greatislander> danayo that time works for me, and any of those days would be fine.
2020-01-21T17:47:47  <danayo> colinclark: let me know if you’d like to join as well ^
2020-01-21T17:47:52  <danayo> ok greatislander
2020-01-21T17:48:04  <erictheise> thanks danayo, I've been meaning to dig into my notes as to who the taxonomy person was.
2020-01-21T17:48:06  <danayo> and michelled! ^
2020-01-21T17:48:44  <cherylhjli> danayo: I think Thursday next week we're supposed to talk to Mike Bass re: the directory at 4:30, and Wednesday I have that research methods class
2020-01-21T17:48:53  <cherylhjli> so maybe Monday & Tuesday?
2020-01-21T17:49:00  <danayo> ok thanks cherylhjli
2020-01-21T17:49:32  <erictheise> i fly home tuesday and will be in the air all day but mo, we, th would work for me.
2020-01-21T17:49:34  <colinclark> danayo: I’m good unless you’d like me to be there
2020-01-21T17:49:43  <colinclark> oh cool, erictheise is here! :)
2020-01-21T17:49:54  <danayo> ok colinclark
2020-01-21T17:49:54  <erictheise> hey colinclark!
2020-01-21T17:50:07  <colinclark> hiya
2020-01-21T17:51:06  <michelled> danayo: if you'd like me there, I can make it, otherwise I'd just like to hear the outcomes
2020-01-21T17:51:33  <jhung> danayo Tuesday and Thursday work best for me. But can do ther other days if others find that more convenient.
2020-01-21T17:51:47  <danayo> gmoss: I agree with your first option - browser back/forward should take the user to whatever page they were last on
2020-01-21T17:52:25  <danayo> or at least browser back gmoss, as you describe
2020-01-21T17:52:31  <danayo> thanks jhung
2020-01-21T17:52:37  <danayo> thanks michelled !
2020-01-21T17:54:19  <danayo> erictheise: sorry just saw your ping - sounds like Monday is the best day for everyone
2020-01-21T17:54:27  <danielcho> michelled: do we have meeting at 1 for C2LC or are we just meeting at 3:30 for Milestone 3 planning?
2020-01-21T17:54:53  <michelled> danielcho: we'll meet at 3:30 for sure
2020-01-21T17:55:12  <michelled> we might meet earlier to do some 0.21 planning, but I'm not sure what time
2020-01-21T17:55:20  <danielcho> ah I see
2020-01-21T17:55:27  <michelled> we'll just ping in the channel and meet when everyone is available
2020-01-21T17:55:51  <danielcho> I told Colin wrong time for the planning meeting then, I will let him know the correct time
2020-01-21T17:56:27  <danielcho> colinclark: sorry, the meeting's at 3:30
2020-01-21T17:58:21  <gmoss> danayo: I was thinking the "continue" and "back" buttons on the page should behave as they do currently, so both interactions are available. I'm glad you agree :)
2020-01-21T18:00:11  <danayo> cherylhjli, greatislander, jhung, erictheise - one more option, sorry, would this Thursday work for all so I can suggest an alternative to monday 27th?
2020-01-21T18:00:33  <greatislander> Yep
2020-01-21T18:01:07  <danayo> guess this is what Doodle Polls are for :p
2020-01-21T18:01:42  <erictheise> danayo, on tues I'm scheduled to have a layover from ~10:44-14:40 central time so I could be available between 11:30 and 14:00 but I'm free anytime mo/we/th next week. th this week is also okay before 17:00 central.
2020-01-21T18:03:21  <danayo> thanks erictheise
