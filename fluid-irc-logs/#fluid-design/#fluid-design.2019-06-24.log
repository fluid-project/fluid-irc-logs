2019-06-24T15:18:51  <colinclark> i think there’s a chance we’ll get an extension and in the meantime I’ll write what I can

2019-06-24T15:19:40  <simonjb> it's going well so far
2019-06-24T15:20:06  <simonjb> we gave our main presentation yesdterday and another shorter one this morning
2019-06-24T15:20:45  <simonjb> and we have a hands on session tomorrow

2019-06-24T17:34:09  <danayo_> sepidehshahi: the BiT site map looks great. your colour coding is super helpful :) I made a bunch of comments
2019-06-24T17:35:27  *** jhung_away is now known as jhung
2019-06-24T17:38:28  <sepidehshahi> Thanks so much danayo_ for taking the time to go through it. I’ll go through your comments and maybe if michelled is available later this week or next week we could have an internal meeting just three of us.
2019-06-24T17:39:04  <danayo_> sounds good sepidehshahi - thanks for putting it together!
2019-06-24T17:39:05  <michelled> sounds good to me!
2019-06-24T17:47:21  <michelled> danayo, sepidehshahi: do you want to meet at 2:30 on Wednesday to talk about BiT?
2019-06-24T17:47:31  <michelled> it looks like there's no community meeting
2019-06-24T17:47:54  <danayo_> works for me michelled
2019-06-24T17:48:09  <sepidehshahi> sounds good to me michelled. If Cheryl doesn’t want to talk about the learning commons
2019-06-24T17:50:04  <michelled> sepidehshahi: was there another meeting scheduled then? I didn't see it in the calendar
2019-06-24T17:51:29  <sepidehshahi> I think they just mentioned it in the stand up last week but nothing has been confirmed yet. So, maybe we could schedule our BiT meeting for now at 2:30
2019-06-24T17:51:57  <michelled> yeah, let's - there's a lot of coop related meeting on tuesday and thursday so I think wednesday is good for BiT

2019-06-24T18:13:48  <cindyli> gmoss: i think i figured out the the problem with serving SJRK /node_modules and /tests directories: https://github.com/cindyli/sjrk-story-telling/commit/53513345bd7a55401be0e910a5d82b1ff8a1e6f5
2019-06-24T18:14:47  <gmoss> cindyli: so the issue is that the root route needs to be placed last in the component tree?
2019-06-24T18:14:54  <gmoss> seems so arbitrary
2019-06-24T18:15:04  <cindyli> the trick is, kettle will go thru request handlers defined here https://github.com/cindyli/sjrk-story-telling/blob/53513345bd7a55401be0e910a5d82b1ff8a1e6f5/src/server/serverSetup.js#L165 from the first to the last, so the themeHandler that serves the root has to be the last on the list
2019-06-24T18:15:06  <gmoss> but I'll test it out shortly!

2019-06-24T18:18:29  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm just putting some USB sticks with video from Pat's retirement together, and I'll test your changes out and see what I can figure out :) I'm glad you found a fix!
2019-06-24T18:18:33  <gmoss> progress, finally.. haha
2019-06-24T18:19:12  <cindyli> no rush
2019-06-24T18:21:01  <cindyli> i'm switching back to work on GPII. ping me if you need me, gmoss

2019-06-24T18:50:02  <michelled> gmoss, cindyli: congrats! this sounds like something that should be documented in the kettle docs
2019-06-24T18:50:15  <michelled> gmoss, maybe after your pull is in you could make one against those docs?
2019-06-24T18:50:59  <gmoss> michelled: great idea, I'll do that for sure. I don't think it mentions it, I checked briefly after Cindy mentioned her solution

2019-06-24T19:25:41  <cindyli> gmoss: will you issue a pull request against the production branch to turn off the editing? let me know if you want me to do it

2019-06-24T20:15:21  <colinclark> sepidehshahi: well, as expected, we are a small data point in justifying Sidewalk Labs’ “Robust Public Engagement Process” :)
2019-06-24T20:15:40  <colinclark> “In the latter half of 2018, Sidewalk Labs reached out to groups whose voices had been missing and brought them to the design and planning table, and also sought to meet people in their own communities. Teams worked with members of the Indig- enous community for a design workshop; engaged seniors in a charrette around housing; travelled to middle schools to ask children and youth for their ideas; and held a series of co-design sessions with
2019-06-24T20:15:41  <colinclark> members of the accessibility community and with people with lived experience of addiction and mental health challenges, in collaboration with the Inclusive Design Research Centre at the Ontario College of Art and Design University.” (69)
2019-06-24T20:16:27  <colinclark> I think it’s a reasonable representation, so I’m happy

2019-06-24T20:17:57  <sepidehshahi> that’s good colinclark. What they are reporting is accurate but I’m not sure what they are justifying with these facts. did they release the plan?
