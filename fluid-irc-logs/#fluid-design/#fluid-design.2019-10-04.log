2019-10-04T15:52:09  <greatislander> alanharnum and colinclark -- your comments reminded me of this which I saw recently: https://css-tricks.com/web-developer-search-history/
2019-10-04T15:52:49  <alanharnum> greatislander: that is fascinating
2019-10-04T15:53:10  <alanharnum> i think i search "revise Git log" at least weekly ^^;
2019-10-04T15:53:48  <colinclark> hahaha
2019-10-04T15:54:24  <colinclark> I feel like my entire knowledge of git involves memorizing a few commands and then asking justin_o or michelled when i get stuck
2019-10-04T15:55:38  <alanharnum> eternal classic: https://m.xkcd.com/1597/
2019-10-04T15:57:23  <greatislander> :)
2019-10-04T16:00:45  <greatislander> cherylhjli colinclark jhung where shall we meet for conference planning?
2019-10-04T16:01:27  <colinclark> anywhere is cool with me
2019-10-04T16:01:35  <jhung> my room?
2019-10-04T16:01:40  <greatislander> sounds good
2019-10-04T16:02:52  <jhung> cherylhjli colinclark we're meeting in my room.

2019-10-04T16:28:29  <cherylhjli> greatislander jhung - I'm going thru the notes from yesterday, so do we have 3h for this? 12-3?
2019-10-04T16:28:37  <greatislander> yep
2019-10-04T16:29:00  <michelled> cherylhjli: but they'll be having lunch at the same time
2019-10-04T16:29:33  <cherylhjli> okay, so they might be working a bit slower if its a working lunch?
2019-10-04T16:29:41  <cherylhjli> I guess we'll also have to factor in the time for them to line up and get lunch
2019-10-04T16:29:44  <michelled> I imagine so for the first bit anyway
2019-10-04T16:30:06  <cherylhjli> I think that's fine, we can do our introductions when everyone's eating
