2019-07-19T16:21:37  <colinclark> cherylhjli: I think you might have the same email autocomplete issue that greatislander had a few months ago…
2019-07-19T16:21:47  <colinclark> sometimes our mailing list software can be really annoying in this regard
2019-07-19T16:22:12  <colinclark> but your notes somehow got sent to the “bounces” email address, rather than the list itself
2019-07-19T16:23:03  <cherylhjli> ahhhh yes that's happened again hasn't it… thank you for catching it colinclark!
2019-07-19T16:23:19  <colinclark> i don’t know how it all gets started
2019-07-19T16:23:48  <colinclark> happened to me years ago, and then my email would always suggest that address, every time
2019-07-19T16:23:53  <colinclark> so annoying :)
2019-07-19T16:24:09  <sepidehshahi> Hi simonjb, I’m not sure if you have seen this already but this web based environment has very inetersting features and supports designing apps, darwing animations, etc.
2019-07-19T16:24:46  <cherylhjli> yeah, my outlook UI truncates long email addresses so it's a guessing game :)
2019-07-19T16:24:55  <simonjb> which environment sepidehshahi ?
2019-07-19T16:25:17  <sepidehshahi> sorry I forgot to paste the link: code.org

2019-07-19T16:26:06  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: ^
2019-07-19T16:26:15  <simonjb> thanks sepidehshahi, I've looked at it but should spend more time with it
2019-07-19T16:26:24  <sepidehshahi> cool
2019-07-19T16:26:43  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: but we should include it in our list of resources
2019-07-19T16:27:19  <sepidehshahi> for sure simonjb, I think their work is really interesting, they support different languages as well
2019-07-19T16:27:28  <simonjb> cool

2019-07-19T17:57:14  <sepidehshahi> this is really cool crystalchan! does this mean we don’t need to wrap it?
2019-07-19T17:58:11  <gmoss> crystalchan: fun!
2019-07-19T18:00:30  <sepidehshahi> crystalchan: they even put it in a container filled with water to wash the paint off! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sroZqLzLiBU
2019-07-19T18:00:48  <crystalchan> I believe so sepidehshahi! This "trusted" review indicates it is scratch resistant and has a waterproof shell.
2019-07-19T18:01:18  <sepidehshahi> great! let’s try it without a cover next time :)

2019-07-19T21:24:22  <colinclark> hey greatislander
2019-07-19T21:24:24  <colinclark> your stuff is great

2019-07-19T21:24:51  <colinclark> any edits or suggestions are very much appreciated
2019-07-19T21:25:01  <michelled1> sorry cherylhjli - I didn't realize you were working on something else too!
2019-07-19T21:25:01  <colinclark> i want to ship this in 30 minutes and then confetti
2019-07-19T21:25:18  <cherylhjli> no worries michelled1 :)
2019-07-19T21:25:20  <colinclark> michelled1, cherylhjli I’m editing the design process page
2019-07-19T21:25:24  <colinclark> so don’t sweat it yet cherylhjli
2019-07-19T21:25:35  <colinclark> the one michelled1 whipped up from the google doc
2019-07-19T21:25:37  <michelled1> ah, cool
2019-07-19T21:26:06  <cherylhjli> ok colinclark, let me know when you're done / need me to take a look!
2019-07-19T21:26:28  <colinclark> almost there
2019-07-19T21:27:03  <colinclark> go for it, cherylhjli: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Iterative+Design+Process
2019-07-19T21:27:20  <colinclark> your summary page, cherylhjli, is wicked, thanks
2019-07-19T21:28:04  <michelled1> colinclark: I'm not sure how to get a better url for this, but this is the co-design guide from the REB: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpageattachments.action?pageId=175669467&preview=/175669467/180945108/Platform%20Coop%20Guide%20for%20Embedded%20Co-design.docx

2019-07-19T21:28:54  <michelled1> greatislander: np :)
2019-07-19T21:29:10  <greatislander> colinclark thanks! reading the draft now, it looks really great
2019-07-19T21:29:16  <colinclark> Can I safely link to the “Platform Co-op Embedded Co-Design Activities” google doc, michelled1?
2019-07-19T21:29:49  <michelled1> yep!
2019-07-19T21:29:57  <michelled1> it's the link that dana gave out to the partners coops
2019-07-19T21:29:59  <colinclark> ugh, it’s an edit link
2019-07-19T21:30:04  <colinclark> but i guess she must have given them the same access
2019-07-19T21:30:06  <colinclark> so that’s fine
2019-07-19T21:30:09  <colinclark> google docs is hilarious
2019-07-19T21:30:15  <michelled1> yeah
2019-07-19T21:30:23  <colinclark> i tried to generate a read-only link and it told me if i did that, i’d lose my own editing access
2019-07-19T21:30:35  <michelled1> hahaha

2019-07-19T21:35:58  <colinclark> We really need to add Embedded Co-Design as a practice in our Guide
2019-07-19T21:36:10  <colinclark> I have nowhere really to link to that defines what embedded co-design is
2019-07-19T21:36:12  <michelled1> yeah
2019-07-19T21:36:16  <colinclark> I’m sure I wrote something at some point

2019-07-19T21:36:25  <colinclark> or did i just talk and now it’s forever lost?
2019-07-19T21:36:35  <colinclark> we do seem to pretty much have invented the term
2019-07-19T21:36:42  <michelled1> you had a presentation that sepi made you a pic for

2019-07-19T21:36:54  <colinclark> since top hits on google seem to point to our or sidewalk’s sites

2019-07-19T21:43:38  <colinclark> wow confluence gave me a terrifying conflict page
2019-07-19T21:43:42  <colinclark> and yet it was all good, i think
2019-07-19T21:44:45  <cherylhjli> phew!!
2019-07-19T21:44:59  <colinclark> michelled1 and cherylhjli: are one of dana’s diagrams appropriate for the design process page, or what do you think?
2019-07-19T21:45:08  <colinclark> maybe not the one where the pcc is outside the circle
2019-07-19T21:45:15  <colinclark> though it is quite apt in a certain sense ;)
2019-07-19T21:46:05  <colinclark> I really like this first paragraph, i hope it explains what we do in useful way
2019-07-19T21:46:15  <michelled1> I was just looking at adding that colinclark
2019-07-19T21:46:32  <michelled1> the pdf looks terrible so I think I should make an image out of it :)
2019-07-19T21:47:41  <cherylhjli> haha colinclark: if not the one where the PCC is outside the circle, then I think the 2nd version she sent is good!
2019-07-19T21:48:01  <colinclark> looks terrible in the wiki you mean?
2019-07-19T21:48:25  <colinclark> i was actually thinking some day i’d love to see a diagram of how a design evolves through our process
2019-07-19T21:48:33  <colinclark> dana’s diagram is great and shows the different contributors to the process
2019-07-19T21:48:35  <michelled1> yeah, in the wiki
2019-07-19T21:48:43  <michelled1> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Iterative+Design+Process
2019-07-19T21:48:58  <colinclark> but it would be cool to see how we start from a tiny rough sketch and keep growing it with all these touch points and iterations
2019-07-19T21:49:12  <colinclark> i’m starting to speak in buzzwords, someone help me
2019-07-19T21:49:32  <colinclark> michelled1: yeah, a png might be better
2019-07-19T21:49:33  <colinclark> this isn’t terrible
2019-07-19T21:49:55  <colinclark> but it is illegible unitl you click on it
2019-07-19T21:51:29  <michelled1> try reloading colinclark
2019-07-19T21:52:04  <cherylhjli> ohh thats much better now michelled1
2019-07-19T21:52:14  <colinclark> ace
2019-07-19T21:52:17  <michelled1> cool  :)
2019-07-19T21:52:27  <colinclark> ok
2019-07-19T21:52:39  <colinclark> so what’s everyone’s final take? should i ship this?
2019-07-19T21:52:52  <colinclark> do you feel it accurately represents what we’ve all done?
2019-07-19T21:53:58  <michelled1> just rereading
2019-07-19T22:02:22  <colinclark> greatislander: It’s possible that my merge conflict did actually clobber some of your changes
2019-07-19T22:02:23  <colinclark> i hope not
2019-07-19T22:07:55  <michelled1> colinclark: it looks great!
2019-07-19T22:08:08  <cherylhjli> colinclark: this looks great! i just tweaked the link for the learning commons prototype - it initially was just linking to a page the home page
2019-07-19T22:08:13  <michelled1> and yes, I think it represents both what we've done and what we plan to do
2019-07-19T22:08:29  <colinclark> thanks cherylhjli
2019-07-19T22:09:06  <colinclark> well, if you’re cool with it, i think i’ll move it into Trebor’s mess of a Google Doc
2019-07-19T22:09:42  <colinclark> i’m looking forward to doing this again next week
2019-07-19T22:10:13  <michelled1> haha,
2019-07-19T22:10:41  <michelled1> good luck colinclark
2019-07-19T22:10:46  <colinclark> thanks
2019-07-19T22:10:51  <colinclark> thank you for all your help
2019-07-19T22:11:12  <cherylhjli> thanks colinclark for doing so much writing and getting this out the door!
2019-07-19T22:11:35  <colinclark> no problem
2019-07-19T22:11:47  <colinclark> it’s much easier than doing the actual work
2019-07-19T22:11:49  <colinclark> so thank you
2019-07-19T22:13:40  <cherylhjli> alright i'm logging off, have a great weekend everyone :)

2019-07-19T22:39:38  <greatislander> hi colinclark, my only changes were lower-casing the "b" in "Pressbooks" (my former coworkers would have killed me!) and one other single-word typo fix and they seem to have survived any merge issues :)
2019-07-19T22:40:01  <colinclark> i caught the pressbooks case issue
2019-07-19T22:40:02  <colinclark> that’s why i figured the merge failed
2019-07-19T22:40:08  <colinclark> but i guess i’ve caught everything else
2019-07-19T22:40:21  <colinclark> thank you so much for writing all that material about our architectural approach btw
2019-07-19T22:40:24  <colinclark> it’s really good
2019-07-19T22:40:40  <colinclark> and i’m super excited to see how it gets implemented
2019-07-19T22:57:00  <greatislander> my pleasure!
