2020-07-07T15:57:41  <cherylhjli> greatislander jhung alanharnum danayo - do we need to check in for coop?
2020-07-07T15:58:00  <cherylhjli> if you messaged already, I might've not seen it - sorry! I accidentally closed my chat..
2020-07-07T15:58:03  <alanharnum> cheryhjli: I'm good myself, just wrapping a few bits up before PR
2020-07-07T15:58:24  <greatislander> I don't think so
2020-07-07T15:58:28  <jhung> I don't need to meet. Just prioritizing leftover Pinecone bugs and wrapping those up.
2020-07-07T15:58:44  <greatislander> @alanharnum when you are ready if there's anything specific you want to touch base about just let me know!
2020-07-07T15:59:43  <cherylhjli> sounds good all
2020-07-07T15:59:47  <danayo> +1
2020-07-07T15:59:51  <jhung> cherylhjli danayo greatislander alanharnum - is it okay if I remove the repeating Co-op meetings from the common calendar. Going forward, we'll just schedule as needed. Does that work for you all?
2020-07-07T16:00:00  <alanharnum> jhung: that works for me
2020-07-07T16:00:42  <cherylhjli> yep! thanks
2020-07-07T16:02:09  <greatislander> makes sense, thanks jhung!
2020-07-07T16:16:42  <danayo> thanks jhung
2020-07-07T16:22:16  * jhung stepping away
2020-07-07T16:30:31  <gmoss> danayo: our technical discussion is ongoing, I can ping you when we're all wrapped up, if you like :)
2020-07-07T16:31:15  <danayo> ok gmoss
2020-07-07T16:42:46  <gmoss> danayo colinclark: shall we meet in standup in a couple minutes for our Storytelling Tool discussion?
2020-07-07T16:43:55  <danayo> ok gmoss. Justin_o too? and cindyli? ^ not sure if all need to be there
2020-07-07T16:44:22  <gmoss> danayo: yep,  sorry cindyli and Justin_o are still in the room from our last call :)
2020-07-07T16:44:24  <gmoss> so I didn't ping them
2020-07-07T16:44:28  <danayo> ah
2020-07-07T16:45:18  <colinclark> i just need a sec
2020-07-07T16:45:30  <colinclark> we’re using this session to talk about the future of the Tool, right?>
2020-07-07T16:45:36  <colinclark> so we definitely want Justin_o and cindyli
2020-07-07T16:45:55  <gmoss> colinclark: no worries, and yes that was the planned topic
2020-07-07T16:47:39  <colinclark> great
2020-07-07T16:47:59  <colinclark> can someone share the zoom url with me?
2020-07-07T16:48:12  <colinclark> oh, it’s the standup room
2020-07-07T18:21:58  <gtirloni> greatislander colinclark: I won't be able to attend our meeting with collab. Just got a call that my car broke and my partner needs some help. I don't think I can be back in time :/ sorry about that. I think the meeting will probably be more around development efforts, since they seem to have the VM/k8s support we would need in any case
2020-07-07T18:23:35  <colinclark> oh no!
2020-07-07T18:23:37  <colinclark> no worries
2020-07-07T18:23:41  <colinclark> we’ll manage
2020-07-07T18:23:57  <gtirloni> thanks and sorry again. leaving now, I'll be back later
2020-07-07T18:24:05  <colinclark> ok cool
2020-07-07T18:32:00  <greatislander> thanks for letting us know, gtirloni! hope you are able to get everything sorted out without too much hassle!
2020-07-07T19:37:14  * gtirloni back
2020-07-07T19:37:44  <gtirloni> greatislander: thanks, it was a battery issue.. i'm too old to push a car up the avenue #destroyed
2020-07-07T19:38:03  <gtirloni> colinclark greatislander: everything sorted with collab?
2020-07-07T19:38:42  <colinclark> yes!
2020-07-07T19:38:48  <colinclark> do you want to debrief with us?  https://ocadu.zoom.us/j/8292896712
2020-07-07T19:39:51  <gtirloni> joining!
2020-07-07T19:57:49  <colinclark> danayo: I just got a note from one of the founders of Pie for Providers!
2020-07-07T19:58:16  <colinclark> she’s hoping to talk with us sometime—they’re transitioning to a non profit organization and going open source
2020-07-07T19:58:31  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-07-07T20:02:34  <danayo> colinclark: cool, yes, Anne had put us in touch and I had tried to set up a meeting with her back in April
2020-07-07T20:02:41  <danayo> glad she got in touch
2020-07-07T20:02:44  <colinclark> oh good
2020-07-07T20:02:52  <colinclark> I think I even remember you mentioning this :)
2020-07-07T20:03:49  <danayo> yeah, I didn’t have her direct contact so was communicating through Anne
