2019-03-04T20:08:15  <sepidehshahi> gmoss: do have a specific page on the wiki for the storytelling tool?
2019-03-04T20:08:28  <gmoss> sepidehshahi: we do, I'll find the link..
2019-03-04T20:08:39  <sepidehshahi> tanks gmoss
2019-03-04T20:10:11  <gmoss> sepidehshahi: I thought we did, but the pages we have are geared more towards storytelling in general with some mentions of the Tool's designs and older versions of it. Nothing exists afaik for the tool on its own.
2019-03-04T20:10:35  <gmoss> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/SJRK+Web+Storytelling+Tools and https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Storytelling+and+Story-gathering+Resources%2C+Tools+and+Examples are the pages that I know of
2019-03-04T20:10:47  <gmoss> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit also links to a few design files
2019-03-04T20:11:20  <gmoss> perhaps we should make the dedicated page michelled mentioned, separately from the SJRK or FLOE 'tree' on the wiki site

2019-03-04T20:12:06  <danayo> sepidehshahi, gmoss I think the idea was that weâ€™d keep this site up to date https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/SJRK+Web+Storytelling+Tools
2019-03-04T20:12:17  <danayo> but we havenâ€™t :(

2019-03-04T20:13:10  <gmoss> danayo: I agree! what do you think about moving it out from under the SJRK umbrella?
2019-03-04T20:13:12  <sepidehshahi> danayo: and gmoss I think thatâ€™s a good place for it. I can add a section there for the storytelling workshops and add those documents there
2019-03-04T20:13:29  <danayo> sure gmoss - and we can link to it from SJRK page
2019-03-04T20:13:40  <gmoss> danayo: the dedicated page i'm referring to does not yet exist, or otherwise it's the one you've mentioned and it needs to be up to date
2019-03-04T20:13:49  <danayo> gotcha
2019-03-04T20:14:48  <gmoss> danayo sepidehshahi michelled: okay, so I'll fiddle with the Wiki right now and try to move that page into its own top-level area, I'll rename it (the old link will no longer work) and I'll update the link from the SJRK main wiki page
2019-03-04T20:16:01  <gmoss> and then, sepidehshahi, you can make the changes you'd like to. does that sound like a reasonable plan?
2019-03-04T20:16:16  <sepidehshahi> sounds good gmoss
2019-03-04T20:16:24  <danayo> sepidehshahi, gmoss: maybe I will also move or copy some of the design file links from the SJRK page to this renewed page as well, to better reflect the design process
2019-03-04T20:16:39  <danayo> what do you think?
2019-03-04T20:17:06  <gmoss> danayo: yes, that sounds like a good idea :) everything related to the tool in one place, and anywhere that needs to make mention of that can link to this page
