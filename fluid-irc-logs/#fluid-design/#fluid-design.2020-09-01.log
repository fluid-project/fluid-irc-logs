2020-09-01T14:38:50  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o! I'm looking at eslint-config-fluid and did a bit of spelunking and now I'm curious about the use of fluid's fork of eslint. Is there a compelling reason to stick with that fork, or has the upstream issue that necessitated it been resolved now?
2020-09-01T14:43:51  <Justin_o> greatislander: I filed an issue about that which is captured in fluid-grunt-lint-all https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/issues/14
2020-09-01T14:44:22  <greatislander> ah cool, thanks!
2020-09-01T14:45:18  <Justin_o> greatislander: I started looking into this some time prior to my vacation. A couple issues are that we need to sort out the formatter, picking an existing one that suits our needs or writing our own. Also eslint has deprecated JSDoc linting support https://eslint.org/blog/2018/11/jsdoc-end-of-life
2020-09-01T14:45:58  <Justin_o> There is a plugin that can be used to add it back, but using plugins with sharable configs is problematic.
2020-09-01T14:46:20  <greatislander> yeah, looks like there would be a fair bit of work to update. I think maybe a good starting point would be seeing how the existing shared config file from eslint-config-fluid works with the current ESlint version
2020-09-01T14:48:33  <Justin_o> greatislander: I think that should be okay as is. I'm not sure what will happen to the JSDoc rule, it hasn't been removed yet but will eventually.
2020-09-01T14:49:04  <greatislander> cool.
2020-09-01T14:49:25  <Justin_o> greatislander: the updating issues are more of a concern for using it with grunt and specifically with fluid-grunt-lint-all
2020-09-01T14:49:35  <greatislander> yeah, that makes sense
2020-09-01T15:30:23  <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning will start soon
2020-09-01T16:30:25  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o: are you available for ST check-in, or would you like a break after the lightning talk?
2020-09-01T16:30:42  <cindyli> gmoss: i'm fine either way
2020-09-01T16:31:38  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm good to do it now if you it works for others
2020-09-01T16:32:02  <gmoss> works for me :)
2020-09-01T16:35:23  <danayo> gmoss, Justin_o, cindyli sorry for delay Iâ€™m available!
2020-09-01T16:35:42  <gmoss> danayo cindyli michelled: Justin_o and I are in the standup room if you'd like to join now :)
2020-09-01T16:35:49  <gmoss> no worries on the delay!
2020-09-01T17:51:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon2: I left a comment on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6538 I'm not sure if we came to a conclusion of what approach to take for the fluid.focus issue. Or I might just be forgetting.
2020-09-01T17:51:39  <Justin_o> bosmon: ^
2020-09-01T18:59:42  <Justin_o> alanharnum: could you please share the link to the clusive prefs editor, I would like to reference it in an issue I'm filing about vertical presentation for UIO+
