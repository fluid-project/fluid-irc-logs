2019-04-17T14:47:38  <greatislander> Hi colinclark! Just to check— our hosting meeting is 12 Eastern, right?
2019-04-17T14:47:46  <greatislander> Are we using Vidyo or something else?
2019-04-17T14:47:57  <colinclark> yeah, noon EDT
2019-04-17T14:48:02  <colinclark> I have no idea how we’ll meet
2019-04-17T14:48:14  <colinclark> Can you send Rylan a quick note and see if he’s got something we can use?
2019-04-17T14:48:22  <greatislander> Sure thing!
2019-04-17T14:48:38  <colinclark> We’ve used Vidyo in the past with CoLab, but I think it’s probably not viable
2019-04-17T14:48:59  <colinclark> Our Zoom adoption plan is progressing, so this is temporary
2019-04-17T14:49:38  <colinclark> thanks  so much, greatislander
2019-04-17T14:49:46  <greatislander> sounds good!
2019-04-17T14:50:13  <greatislander> on my end I have found Vidyo fairly unreliable but I think it’s more to do with my aging laptop than the connection :(
2019-04-17T14:52:20  <greatislander> colinclark oops it looks like Rylan thought we were doing 11 Eastern
2019-04-17T14:52:22  <colinclark> no, i think vidyo has become quite unreliable
2019-04-17T14:52:24  <greatislander> Is that okay for you?
2019-04-17T14:52:24  <colinclark> it looks like it
2019-04-17T14:52:27  <colinclark> yeah, i can do that
2019-04-17T14:52:34  <greatislander> Okay, talk soon
2019-04-17T14:52:47  <colinclark> it just takes away my window for travelling into the office
2019-04-17T14:52:54  <colinclark> so i’ll settle in here at home
2019-04-17T14:52:59  <greatislander> ah okay
2019-04-17T14:54:23  <colinclark> btw, greatislander and cherylhjli, I got a private note from Trebor last night asking “does this mean we won’t be ready for the 22nd?”—so I confirmed that it wasn’t practical
2019-04-17T14:54:39  <greatislander> thanks colinclark
2019-04-17T14:54:59  <colinclark> and if you feel like a trip to NYC, I think there’s the opportunity to attend the institute launch event
2019-04-17T14:55:13  <colinclark> it’s looking like i can’t do it, and jutta is in montreal that day
2019-04-17T14:55:23  <greatislander> Is that the 22nd?
2019-04-17T14:55:27  <colinclark> yup
2019-04-17T14:55:28  <colinclark> monday :)
2019-04-17T14:55:37  <greatislander> hah, too short notice for me i think
2019-04-17T14:56:16  <cherylhjli> thanks for sending that note to Trebor colinclark! have a good meeting with colab.
2019-04-17T14:59:23  <colinclark> greatislander: Looks like I’ll be a couple minutes late, this one is going on long
2019-04-17T14:59:32  <colinclark> I’m just waiting for the appropriate opportunity to bail out
2019-04-17T14:59:33  <greatislander> okay colinclark

2019-04-17T15:16:13  <colinclark> cherylhjli: ok, it sounds like we’re all set
2019-04-17T15:16:34  <colinclark> greatislander and Tomasz from CoLab will follow up about the technical details and getting a staging server setup
2019-04-17T15:16:49  <colinclark> Trebor and Rylan will follow up in terms of the business relationship
2019-04-17T15:17:11  <colinclark> And I think we should just keep going
2019-04-17T15:17:32  <cherylhjli> sounds good colinclark, let's just keep going!
2019-04-17T15:17:36  <colinclark> we should probably do some tasking at some, cherylhjli and greatislander, so we can come up with our own set of dates and milestones
2019-04-17T15:17:40  <colinclark> at some point
2019-04-17T15:17:44  <greatislander> Agreed
2019-04-17T15:17:51  <cherylhjli> ^same
2019-04-17T15:18:16  <colinclark> greatislander: It’s so awesome to have you developing this
2019-04-17T15:18:37  <colinclark> and it sounds like your approach is nicely aligned with what Tomasz is familiar with
2019-04-17T15:19:02  <greatislander> colinclark cherylhjli it’s been a lot of fun! I’m really happy with how it’s coming along and yeah, sounds like we are on the same page with is excellent
2019-04-17T15:19:39  <colinclark> i’m sorry to have been so scarce recently in regards to meetings etc., but that will clear up soon
2019-04-17T15:19:45  <greatislander> no worries!
2019-04-17T15:20:23  <colinclark> cherylhjli: Rylan did mention that he’d like to catch up with us more generally, to hear what we’re working on and have planned
2019-04-17T15:20:44  <colinclark> so it’ll be great to talk more with them about our plans for the labour tools and co-designing them with our partner cooperatives at some point
2019-04-17T15:21:04  <cherylhjli> colinclark: that sounds like a really great opportunity! yes definitely lets see how we can collab
2019-04-17T15:21:18  <cherylhjli> and no worries about the meetings :) life happens!

2019-04-17T18:13:36  <greatislander> colinclark I don’t have a strong opinion— has he worked with them before?
2019-04-17T18:15:39  <greatislander> colinclark From their site: “If you are an organization interested in hosting with us and need someone to help design, develop, or maintain your web site, we likely know the freelancer or consultant business that is right for you.“ So it sounds like they do less of the maintenance side then CoLab would
2019-04-17T18:15:52  <greatislander> That seems to be an important factor to consider
2019-04-17T18:15:55  <carenwatkins_> gmoss: I have to change our meeting this afternoon. I will ping you tomorrow about rescheduling. Sorry for the short notice.
2019-04-17T18:16:06  <colinclark> yeah
2019-04-17T18:16:19  <colinclark> greatislander: and yet they do have a $15/mo WordPress maintenance package
2019-04-17T18:16:28  <colinclark> so it’s not clear
2019-04-17T18:16:29  <gmoss> carenwatkins_: no worries! tomorrow may be an early day for me, actually
2019-04-17T18:16:32  <greatislander> Right, plugin updates etc.
2019-04-17T18:16:37  <colinclark> but it does look like old-fashioned VPS hosting
2019-04-17T18:16:57  <colinclark> but who knows, they seem to do custom stuff too

2019-04-17T18:23:45  <greatislander> Yeah. Personally I’d go for CoLab just based on what I learned about their workflow. But I’m sure a different option would work well too.
2019-04-17T18:26:40  <colinclark> yeah, me too
2019-04-17T18:26:45  <colinclark> I think he wants multiple quotes
2019-04-17T18:27:25  <colinclark> I was pretty impressed with CoLab when we spoke with them today—I think it will be a good collaboration
2019-04-17T18:27:31  <colinclark> as opposed to a more traditional host
2019-04-17T18:54:26  <greatislander> colinclark I feel very much the same way
