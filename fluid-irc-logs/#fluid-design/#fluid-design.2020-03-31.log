2020-03-31T16:27:59  <jhung> Justin_o maybe around 1pm?
2020-03-31T16:29:30  <Justin_o> sure
2020-03-31T16:29:51  <cindyli> lliskovoi_, michelled, on the WeCount website footer, there are links to facebook, youtube, twitter, instagram. do you know what href they should point to?
2020-03-31T16:30:13  <Justin_o> cindyli: I wonder if David or vera would know
2020-03-31T16:30:14  <lliskovoi_> cindyli: I'll ask Vera and David

2020-03-31T16:36:36  <lliskovoi_> maybe we should just hide the social media icons for now?
2020-03-31T16:36:53  <lliskovoi_> I should have a better idea of a timeline on Thursday during the marketing meeting
2020-03-31T16:37:47  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: shall i hide the entire "follow me on social media" section? that will leave the top right corner of the footer empty
2020-03-31T16:38:07  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: what timeline is that?
2020-03-31T16:38:30  <lliskovoi_> For when we'll have these social media accounts set up
2020-03-31T16:38:40  <lliskovoi_> I think that would work as a temporary thing

2020-03-31T19:57:33  <lliskovoi_> Hey greatislander, Teddy___ I'm trying to figure out the optimal settings for svgs when I export them since Cindy was having an issue with the previous versions. I'm now exporting in a different way and wanted to run some settings by you. When you have a minute, could you have a look at the settings section under "Export As Method"? I chose Presentation Attributes for the last versions I exported, but wondering
2020-03-31T19:57:34  <lliskovoi_> if there's a different option that works better.
2020-03-31T19:57:43  <lliskovoi_> https://css-tricks.com/illustrator-to-svg/
2020-03-31T19:58:43  <greatislander> lliskovoi_ my general approach has been to use Export for Screens
2020-03-31T19:59:17  <greatislander> then run the resulting SVG through ImageOptim: https://imageoptim.com/mac
2020-03-31T20:00:38  <lliskovoi_> ok cool greatislander, I'll give that a try
2020-03-31T20:01:03  <lliskovoi_> it seems to be similar to the export as method, but maybe doesn't give you as many options for how it outputs the css
2020-03-31T20:04:22  <jhung> greatislander let me know when you're free. Looking at PR #246.
2020-03-31T20:04:39  <greatislander> okay, will probably be a half hour or so
2020-03-31T20:07:02  <jhung> no prob.
