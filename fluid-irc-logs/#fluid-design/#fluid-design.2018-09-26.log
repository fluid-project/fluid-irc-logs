2018-09-26T15:33:18  <jhung> carenwatkins_: Found the footer.
2018-09-26T15:33:45  <carenwatkins_> Ah, great. jhung Can I access it?
2018-09-26T15:33:59  <jhung> carenwatkins_: you can edit it using the Theme Editor. Go to Sidebar > Appearance > Editor.
2018-09-26T15:34:01  <jhung> then...
2018-09-26T15:34:37  <jhung> carenwatkins_: in the right sidebar that shows different theme files, choose "Theme Footer (footer.php)".
2018-09-26T15:35:02  <jhung> Then in the editor on Line 46, you can see the footer text there.

2018-09-26T19:41:31  <Justin_o> danayo: sorry i got distracted with a work conversation during your question, so you may have covered this. I wonder if we need to have a style guide for our work to capture some things. Like focus styling and etc. I wonder if that would simplify the creation of mockups and wireframes.

2018-09-26T20:13:20  <danayo> hey Justin_o: I think we’ve considered a style guide before…I think keeping it more general could work - like “ensure the visible focus state is clearly visible and in high contrast” etc
2018-09-26T20:15:24  <danayo> it could be combined with something like “documenting a11y considerations in wireframes” as an ILDH entry perhaps - something like what you were suggesting michelled
2018-09-26T20:16:25  <Justin_o> danayo: that seems reasonable
