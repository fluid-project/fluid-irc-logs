2020-04-29T15:32:46  <cindyli> greatislander: it seems `npm run lint` in the eleventy branch doesn't lint .njk files
2020-04-29T15:33:05  <greatislander> that's correct— are you looking at the JavaScript in search.njk?
2020-04-29T15:33:28  <greatislander> I think it should be moved into a javascript file in `/src/js` but I didn't get around to that when I was working on the proof of concept
2020-04-29T15:33:35  <cindyli> ya, the search via index.json is done. working on the page layout
2020-04-29T15:33:40  <greatislander> awesome!
2020-04-29T15:33:50  <cindyli> ok, i see. shall i move it, greatislander
2020-04-29T15:34:12  <greatislander> If you want to leave it as is for now we could pair up to look at it tomorrow
2020-04-29T15:34:37  <cindyli> ok. i will give a try first
2020-04-29T15:34:44  <greatislander> sounds good!
2020-04-29T15:34:54  <greatislander> docs for the build system: https://laravel-mix.com
2020-04-29T15:35:18  <greatislander> and ideally we'd only load that script on that page, so it should be its own JS file
2020-04-29T15:35:23  <greatislander> thanks cindyli
2020-04-29T15:36:03  <cindyli> cool. thank YOU!

2020-04-29T15:56:40  <jhung> greatislander ready now. I'll be in coop rm
2020-04-29T15:56:43  <greatislander> Teddy___: something good for you to start researching, as it'll be the priority as soon as the updated We Count site is launched, is UIO integration
2020-04-29T15:56:56  <greatislander> here's a good place to start: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html
2020-04-29T16:06:44  <Teddy___> Okay thanks greatislander
2020-04-29T16:10:44  <greatislander> cherylhjli colinclark Let me know if there's a window of time tomorrow or Friday when I can walk through the new IDRC site's CMS with both of you. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
2020-04-29T16:11:12  <colinclark> if friday is okay, that’d be my preference
2020-04-29T16:11:25  <colinclark> just so i can finish these reports
2020-04-29T16:12:54  <cherylhjli> friday works for me!

2020-04-29T16:44:12  <Caren_> hi Justin_o UIO+ check-in at 1:30 works for me if that is still ok for you
2020-04-29T16:50:55  <Justin_o> Caren_: thanks, that should work for me still
2020-04-29T16:51:57  <danayo> greatislander: I’m working on the Log In/Sign up typography - was just going to annotate the mockups in Figma, unless you have a preference for a different way to document it?

2020-04-29T18:25:29  <cindyli> i upgraded my node and npm to the latest version for we count and cannot `npm install` sjrk repo :(
2020-04-29T18:27:18  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm running 10.15.3
2020-04-29T18:27:37  <cindyli> ok. trying it
2020-04-29T18:28:10  <gmoss> are you getting error messages? I think there were some issues that I'd previously run into trying to upgrade to Node v12, but it's been a while and I've forgotten exactly what issues
2020-04-29T18:28:24  <gmoss> something about particular versions of infusion, maybe
2020-04-29T18:36:42  <cindyli> gmoss: still fails with 10.15.3. there's a long list of deprecated message such as
2020-04-29T18:37:09  <cindyli> inline V8_DEPRECATED("Use maybe version", Local<Object> ToObject() const);
2020-04-29T18:38:04  <gmoss> cindyli: hmm that one doesn't seem familiar to me..
2020-04-29T18:38:08  <gmoss> what version of NPM?
2020-04-29T18:38:19  <cindyli> 6.4.1
2020-04-29T18:38:28  <cindyli> what do you have
2020-04-29T18:39:00  <gmoss> same
2020-04-29T18:39:06  <gmoss> curious
2020-04-29T18:40:13  <cindyli> gmoss: nvm, seems all those messages are warnings, not errors. so i still can start the sjrk server.
2020-04-29T18:40:27  <gmoss> cindyli: phew, that's reassuring!
2020-04-29T18:41:01  <cindyli> but it's confirmed sjrk doesn't work with node 12, gmoss. seems it's a known issue
2020-04-29T18:44:40  <gmoss> cindyli: yes, I've run into that before. we'll have to deal with this at some point in order to weed out vulnerabilities. I'm usually tempted to update all the deps, but that's out of scope for most Jiras so I don't :)
2020-04-29T18:45:05  <gtirloni> cindyli gmoss: looks like the github actions workflow ran successfully.. can you confirm the deploy is fine?

2020-04-29T18:48:41  <gmoss> cindyli: I've just noticed an issue with the Floe stories theme that I missed during my testing after hiding the Table of Contents container
2020-04-29T18:49:01  <gmoss> should be a quick fix, I'll file a new PR shortly
