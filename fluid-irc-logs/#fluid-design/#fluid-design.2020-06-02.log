2020-06-02T16:52:37  <greatislander> Adds "Unwrapped" variants for a number of form elements, adds multiple select element, generally makes all of Pinecone's form styles compatible with Django and django-formtools
2020-06-02T16:53:07  <greatislander> It's a blocker for continuing work on the organization creation flow so the sooner you can get to it the better. Thanks! :)

2020-06-02T20:24:48  <gtirloni> gmoss et all: what's our strategy for moving changes from the Story Telling master branch over to other branches? Do we cherry pick and push to the repository directly? I'd like to get this PR merged and then the change applied to all branches, if that's okay -- https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/78
2020-06-02T20:34:15  <gmoss> gtirloni: when we're doing a "release", we just merge master into those other branches, but generally we like to do some testing to make sure there are no regressions. That said your PR is pretty simple, so if the staging site continues to work after it's merged into master, I'm good with it getting pushed out
2020-06-02T20:35:45  <gmoss> gtirloni: we should revisit this once we start working on SJRK-343 (https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-343)
2020-06-02T20:36:40  <gmoss> SJRK-266 will also be relevant in the future: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-266
2020-06-02T20:47:48  <gtirloni> cool, thanks!
2020-06-02T20:47:57  <gtirloni> gmoss: and should the push out be done through separate PR's?
2020-06-02T20:48:23  <gmoss> gtirloni: I don't think it's necessary, though I'd see what cindyli has to say on the matter :)
2020-06-02T20:48:42  <gmoss> I think the initial push to master is the important one since that's going to be thoroughly reviewed, etc
2020-06-02T20:48:54  <gmoss> (it's all important, obviously)
2020-06-02T20:49:22  <gtirloni> ok
2020-06-02T21:24:52  <greatislander> cherylhjli, danayo where is the best place to find out which fields you consider as required for the individual and organizational profile creation flows? Wires in Figma?
2020-06-02T21:33:57  <cherylhjli> I think they're all in figma, right danayo?
2020-06-02T22:15:03  <greatislander> thanks
