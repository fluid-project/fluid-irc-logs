2019-10-10T19:57:34  <gmoss> Bosmon: In fixing a bug with IE11, I've implemented a variation on some of the review you left on your SJRK-255 PR. It would be great if you could take a look at it when you have a spare cycle or two. https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/46
2019-10-10T19:57:42  <gmoss> for reference, here's the feedback you left: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#pullrequestreview-270696714
2019-10-10T19:58:27  <Bosmon> Thanks, gmoss, I'll take a look
2019-10-10T19:58:36  <Bosmon> It wasn't clear how the comment was related to the IE11 issue
2019-10-10T19:58:38  <gmoss> Thanks, Bosmon!
2019-10-10T19:58:47  <Bosmon> Which seemed to centre on the use of .includes() or so?
2019-10-10T19:59:07  <gmoss> Bosmon: that's correct, .includes isn't implemented by Trident, so IE can't use it
2019-10-10T19:59:25  <Bosmon> Oh yes
2019-10-10T19:59:27  <gmoss> your proposed fix circumvents the issue
2019-10-10T19:59:29  <Bosmon> I see it in there on line 186
2019-10-10T20:00:00  <Bosmon> A cheap fix would have just been to replace it with .indexOf() thing !== -1, but I'm glad to see the wider issue fixed :)
2019-10-10T20:00:26  <Bosmon> I think your fix looks good
2019-10-10T20:00:55  <gmoss> Bosmon: excellent :)
2019-10-10T20:01:03  <gmoss> thanks for taking a look!
2019-10-10T20:01:20  <Bosmon> Another option would have kept your existing logic structure and replaced the manual check with an call to fluid.queryIoCSelector()
