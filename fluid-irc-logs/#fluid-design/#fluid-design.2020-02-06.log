2020-02-06T21:18:55  <Caren_> michelled: gmoss There are 3 stories by a learner that they would like to publish. When might that be able to happen?
2020-02-06T21:27:24  <gmoss> Caren_: which site would they like to publish them to? if they're ready to be published (organized into blocks, etc), then it would be a matter of having alanharnum reach into the server configuration to enable editing, then once the stories are to your satisfaction the editing can be turned off once more :)
2020-02-06T21:28:56  <Caren_> the stories are for this site, gmoss : https://stories.floeproject.org/storyBrowse.html

2020-02-06T21:47:00  <gmoss> colinclark: I'll definitely add it to the list! We used to have these values configured in the codebase, but we decided at the time that it might be better to have them stored in a configuration file that's independent of the code. this is a common sticking point and key person dependency, so I think it's time to revisit that decision
2020-02-06T21:47:03  <gmoss> thanks alanharnum!

2020-02-06T21:47:26  <alanharnum> gmoss Caren_: I've unlocked editing on https://stories.floeproject.org/ but the "Explore Tool" link still goes to the staging server - does something else need to be changed to make this work?
2020-02-06T21:47:53  <colinclark> a config file seems fine, gmoss
2020-02-06T21:47:57  <alanharnum> Going to https://stories.floeproject.org/storyEdit.html does seem to work
2020-02-06T21:48:17  <colinclark> I think the thing is to have the environment set up so you can make a change to it, push it to a repo, and the server will redeploy the app
2020-02-06T21:48:18  <gmoss> colinclark: said config file isn't versioned, currently, do you think it would make sense to just add it back into the repo?
2020-02-06T21:48:50  <colinclark> well, i guess itâ€™s a question of what to do about multiple instances
2020-02-06T21:49:09  <colinclark> because youâ€™ve got, what, three different sites running this codebase?
2020-02-06T21:49:13  <alanharnum> colinclark gmoss: for maximum eventual utility I would consider taking the Wordpress approach of having a configuration file that also has options editable via the web interface - I know administrative functions like that are also on the eventual future plan.
2020-02-06T21:49:18  <colinclark> so you need a repo that contains configuration for those sites
2020-02-06T21:49:36  <colinclark> alanharnum: Sure, having a nice editable web interface for admin stuff would be great
2020-02-06T21:49:36  <gmoss> colinclark: indeed.. they're all being built from their own branches anyway. four flavours running currently :)
2020-02-06T21:49:58  <alanharnum> exit
2020-02-06T21:49:59  <colinclark> but is predicated on having lots of things we wonâ€™t have for a bit, like an account management system
2020-02-06T21:50:30  <colinclark> gmoss: aha, ok
2020-02-06T21:50:30  <colinclark> so we'
2020-02-06T21:50:35  <gmoss> colinclark: i think that could be achieved with basic auth, though I'd want to look into the security of that
2020-02-06T21:50:40  <colinclark> weâ€™ve got a branch-per-site deployment
2020-02-06T21:50:43  <gmoss> colinclark: correct
2020-02-06T21:50:54  <colinclark> gmoss: seems like we could solve this particular issue more easily than with web interface
2020-02-06T21:51:23  <colinclark> what would need to happen to just have everything needed to configure a site within the repo, and have that be automated?
2020-02-06T21:51:35  <colinclark> i.e. you push a change to a branch, and CI builds and deploys everything
2020-02-06T21:51:42  <colinclark> I imagine thatâ€™s very close to what we already have?
2020-02-06T21:52:05  <gmoss> colinclark: that is exactly what we have currently, in fact
2020-02-06T21:52:16  <gmoss> except the config file not being tracked, obv
2020-02-06T21:52:25  <colinclark> ok, thatâ€™s great
2020-02-06T21:52:28  <colinclark> so if the file were tracked
2020-02-06T21:52:33  <colinclark> and if it werenâ€™t filled with secrets or anything
2020-02-06T21:52:37  <colinclark> this would just work?
2020-02-06T21:52:44  <colinclark> without requiring us to ping alanharnum?
2020-02-06T21:52:50  <gmoss> colinclark: yep, I think so! we have a secrets.json for secrets, btw ;)
2020-02-06T21:52:51  <alanharnum> IIRC there's a separate "config" file and a separate "secrets" file
2020-02-06T21:53:02  <alanharnum> so there's no harm in having the config files versioned on a per-repo basis
2020-02-06T21:53:04  <colinclark> cool, so theyâ€™re already separate
2020-02-06T21:53:14  <gmoss> I'll whip up a Jira for this and add it to the tasklist
