2020-08-04T14:16:37  <michelled> hey Justin_o, Lisa just mentioned this article as having really good guidance - thought you'd find it interesting https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/09/building-inclusive-toggle-buttons/
2020-08-04T14:17:59  <Justin_o> michelled: thanks
2020-08-04T14:35:08  <Justin_o> michelled: that was a thorough article that captured different options and use cases for implanting toggle buttons or similar UI elements. The switch component in Infusion is implemented similar to the recommendations, although it doesn't use a button element by default; or at least the demo doesn't. I'm not sure if that's related to styling, or if we could change to using a button element.
2020-08-04T14:36:25  <michelled> I can't remember Justin_o
2020-08-04T14:36:30  <michelled> might be something to look into
2020-08-04T14:39:43  <Justin_o> michelled: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6539
2020-08-04T14:51:22  <michelled> cool
2020-08-04T14:51:55  <michelled> we should do some infusion planning at some point to prioritize and schedule some of that work
2020-08-04T14:53:04  <Justin_o> michelled: that makes sense, there are a bunch of infusion things we should get to, and I've been trying to knock some things off here and there when I have a spare moment or two.
2020-08-04T14:53:43  <michelled> Justin_o: let me know when you want to do it - I generally have time on Thursdays
2020-08-04T14:55:14  <Justin_o> michelled: I should be able to make time this Thursday. I'll be away the following 3 weeks though. Also we may want to involve Bosmon in that planning
2020-08-04T15:03:10  <jhung> Justin_o just for your reference, here's the toggle button we made in Pinecone: https://pinecone.netlify.app/components/detail/button--toggle-button.html
2020-08-04T15:04:09  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. out of curiosity how does one know what state that is in?
2020-08-04T15:04:37  <jhung> Programatically or visually Justin_o ?
2020-08-04T15:04:49  <Justin_o> jhung: visually.. as a user
2020-08-04T15:06:46  <jhung> In Pinecone we're using a consistent visual language to indicate active or selected states. In this case it's a button with an inverted style. Out of context it may be hard to tell, but in context with the application / website, it works a bit better.
2020-08-04T15:07:14  <Justin_o> jhung: okay, thanks
2020-08-04T15:07:36  <Justin_o> I added a link to that example as a comment on the JIRA
2020-08-04T15:07:51  <jhung> The Also it's just a template, so the actual implementation can customize it (i.e. add a checkmark for aria-checked=true state, change the button text etc.)
2020-08-04T15:15:41  <michelled> good idea, Justin_o, and maybe let's wait until you're back so it'll be fresh for you :)
2020-08-04T15:15:53  <Justin_o> michelled: sounds good thanks
2020-08-04T15:30:59  <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning is starting soon
2020-08-04T16:12:30  <cherylhjli> jhung justin_o philip - I don't have an opinion on when community meetings and design crits should be - just let me know what y'all decide on! The only thing I will note is that the community meeting i'm proposing does need a 90-min time slot
2020-08-04T16:13:21  <Justin_o> cherylhjli: thanks for letting us know.. is there any urgency or timeline for when that needs to happen?
2020-08-04T16:16:38  <cherylhjli> the community meeting - no. for the design crit, i'd rather sooner than later since I'm trying to get as much IDRC work done as possible before I'm put on a new project :P
2020-08-04T16:24:52  <Justin_o> cherylhjli: thanks. I think jhung and Philip were also going in the same direction for the scheduling.
2020-08-04T16:31:19  <gmoss> cindyli Justin_o michelled: are you available for ST check-in? I need a couple minutes, so let's say 12:35?
2020-08-04T16:31:34  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2020-08-04T16:31:44  *** jhung is now known as jhung_away
2020-08-04T16:34:04  <cindyli> sure
2020-08-04T16:34:20  <michelled> yup
2020-08-04T17:44:43  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-08-04T20:47:06  <cindyli> greatislander: i wonder if you ever ran into this airtable issue: I issued a pull request - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/367, which needs to fetch data from Airtable. AIRTABLE_API_KEY has been defined in netlify as an environment variable. the build of this pull request fails with the error: "Error: An API key is required to connect to Airtable". but the deploy preview of this pull request did
2020-08-04T20:47:06  <cindyli>  fetch data successfully from Airtable and constructed the target pag - https://deploy-preview-367--wecount.netlify.app/initiatives/
2020-08-04T20:47:46  <cindyli> did you run into this problem with Airtable + netlify?
