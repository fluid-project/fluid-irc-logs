2019-08-29T14:40:00  <Justin_o> danielcho, sepidehshahi: I came across this project yesterday. It's a prototype driven development tool for Vuejs. It's still pretty early on for it though, so they are still building out features for it. Anyways, it looks like an interesting idea https://www.overvue.io

2019-08-29T14:43:36  <danielcho> Justin_o: I tried its demo on the bottom of the site and it looks really easy to use! I will also let Simon know when he is back!
2019-08-29T14:43:53  <Justin_o> cool thanks

2019-08-29T15:11:54  <sepidehshahi> thanks Justin_o, I installed the app and I’m trying to play with it to better understand its different features
2019-08-29T15:17:27  <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: here's a blog post about it, https://medium.com/better-programming/overvue-a-vue-prototyping-tool-f2b8a2f0c229

2019-08-29T19:27:51  <sepidehshahi> Hi cherylhjli, is it possible to see the wireframes you were after you went through the card sorting activity for the platform coop?
2019-08-29T19:28:27  <sepidehshahi> I am thinking about BiT project and I am not sure how refine I should make the wireframes
2019-08-29T19:28:27  <cherylhjli> hey sepidehshahi, we just did the card sorting and haven't changed the wireframes to reflect that yet
2019-08-29T19:28:46  <cherylhjli> oh, are you looking for what fidelity the wireframes are in sepidehshahi?
2019-08-29T19:29:34  <sepidehshahi> that’s right, I want to build something that has enough features for our next co-design sessions cherylhjli and I thought maybe I could get inspiration from your work
2019-08-29T19:30:04  <cherylhjli> sepidehshahi - here is the figma file for our wireframes: https://www.figma.com/file/mFX3VNjxVdrW6A0tUGqQ9B/Resource-Library-Community-feedback-Aug-2019?node-id=12%3A105
2019-08-29T19:30:28  <cherylhjli> as you know unfortunately figma doesn't do the "sketchy line" look or else we might've used that, but this is definitely one fidelity level higher
2019-08-29T19:30:32  <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot
2019-08-29T19:30:34  <cherylhjli> np!
2019-08-29T19:31:14  <sepidehshahi> this is very helpful
2019-08-29T19:31:24  <cherylhjli> :)
2019-08-29T19:31:32  <cherylhjli> lemme know if you have any more q's or need anything else!

2019-08-29T20:11:08  <gmoss> ping sepidehshahi
2019-08-29T20:11:19  <sepidehshahi> hi gmoss
2019-08-29T20:11:55  <gmoss> hi sepidehshahi :) I just remembered what you mentioned in standup this morning, that David may reach out to me next week for some help in using the storytelling tool. is he aware that I'll be away most of the week?
2019-08-29T20:12:35  <sepidehshahi> no gmoss, and I totally forgot about that
2019-08-29T20:12:54  <gmoss> sepidehshahi: no worries at all. I can reach out to him and let him know my availability
2019-08-29T20:13:02  <sepidehshahi> but that should be ok, I have also given him a link to the user guide for the storytelling
2019-08-29T20:13:23  <sepidehshahi> sure gmoss
2019-08-29T20:16:45  <gmoss> sepidehshahi: hopefully the guide is sufficient, but I'll let him know that I'm around on Tuesday :)
2019-08-29T20:17:03  <sepidehshahi> that would be great, thanks gmoss
