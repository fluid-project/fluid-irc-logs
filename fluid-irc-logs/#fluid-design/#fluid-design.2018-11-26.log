2018-11-26T15:55:10  <Justin_o> jhung: the custom build can do both, but the general build does just infusion..
2018-11-26T15:55:12  <Justin_o> should we do both
2018-11-26T15:55:19  <Justin_o> i guess i should also set it up to do by folder

2018-11-26T15:57:41  <Justin_o> but i don't know if you'd want separate font files for each
2018-11-26T15:57:48  <Justin_o> wouldn't you want a single file?
2018-11-26T15:58:14  <Justin_o> do you want to talk this over quickly

2018-11-26T16:54:46  <jhung> Justin_o: infusion-icons-all?
2018-11-26T16:55:10  <jhung> I would match the vocabulary used in the build / grunt file.
2018-11-26T16:55:26  <Justin_o> currently have i have Infusion-Icons, FontAwesome-Icons
2018-11-26T16:55:55  <Justin_o> how about Infusion-All-Icons?

2018-11-26T16:57:35  <jhung> Justin_o: Ah, I see. Infusion-All-Icons fits the pattern.
2018-11-26T16:58:34  <jhung> Justin_o: I guess that's ok. Would "All-Icons" not be specific enough? I wonder if "Infusion-All" would imply just infusion and not the FA icons?
2018-11-26T16:59:50  <Justin_o> I think you're right, but it might be confusing if you were to use that in a project.
2018-11-26T17:00:02  <Justin_o> Would you understand what All-Icons.woff was for?
2018-11-26T17:00:13  <Justin_o> or where it was from..
2018-11-26T17:00:19  <Justin_o> if you think so, then it should be fine
2018-11-26T17:01:59  <jhung> All-icons can be too generic Justin_o.Also could be confusing in situations where All-icons is not the only icon set being used.
2018-11-26T17:03:35  <Justin_o> jhung: any other thoughts on a name?
2018-11-26T17:04:26  <jhung> Justin_o: let me think...
2018-11-26T17:05:44  <Justin_o> thanks, cause i' having trouble ;)
2018-11-26T17:10:10  <Justin_o> jhung: maybe going to the other scheme you mentioned is better
2018-11-26T17:10:11  <jhung> basically we want the name to convey the source of the font (i.e. "infusion icons"), and the contents ("infusion", "all", "font-awesome").
2018-11-26T17:10:18  <Justin_o> jhung: yes
2018-11-26T17:10:57  <jhung> Part of the problem is the repo name - it overlaps with the contents.
2018-11-26T17:11:07  <Justin_o> jhung: that's true
2018-11-26T17:11:34  <Justin_o> i wonder if going back to your earlier suggestion may be good.. infusion-icons, infusion-icons-all, infusion-icons-fontAwesome
2018-11-26T17:12:02  <Justin_o> for custom icon fonts we currently let them be called anything
2018-11-26T17:13:50  <jhung> I'm having an issue with "infusion-icons" not sure if it's clear it's just the infusion icons, and not all'
2018-11-26T17:14:39  <Justin_o> infusion-icons-some
2018-11-26T17:15:29  <Justin_o> infusion-icons-firstParty?
2018-11-26T17:16:31  <Justin_o> infusion-icons-original?
2018-11-26T17:19:33  <jhung> I keep feeling the naming should match both the grunt build flags and the sub directory names Justin_o. Because of this, I think we might want to entertain the idea of renaming the repoâ€¦ am I crazy?
2018-11-26T17:20:16  <Justin_o> moderately.. ;)
2018-11-26T17:20:20  <Justin_o> what would you want to call it?
2018-11-26T17:25:32  <jhung> Justin_o: lol I have no idea!
2018-11-26T17:26:25  <jhung> "project-icons"
2018-11-26T17:26:27  <jhung> ?
2018-11-26T17:27:20  <jhung> Justin_o: In github it would be infusion-project > project-icons. The built files would be project-icons-infusion, project-icons-all, project-icons-fontAwesome?
2018-11-26T17:27:53  <Justin_o> project icons is a bit generic too
2018-11-26T17:28:03  <Justin_o> fluid-icons maybe.. but that also could have problems
2018-11-26T17:28:17  <Justin_o> the other issue with renaming is around the rpm package that was published ;(
2018-11-26T17:29:20  <jhung> Justin_o: maybe go with "infusion-all, infusion-fontAwesome, infusion-only"?
2018-11-26T17:29:49  <Justin_o> that's better
2018-11-26T17:30:19  <Justin_o> what do you think of infusion-icons, infusion-icons-extended, infusion-icons-fontAwesome
2018-11-26T17:30:50  <jhung> Not clear to me when "extended" icons mean and how that's different from "infusion-icons"
2018-11-26T17:32:48  <Justin_o> so in your suggestion, are you saying we should leave off the word Icons?

2018-11-26T17:34:17  <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2018-11-26T17:39:41  <Justin_o> jhung: also there are at least 2 name collisions with the icons. play and pause both appear in infusion and fontaweseom
2018-11-26T17:40:14  <Justin_o> so 1 option is to not have an all.. it will only do infusion, font awesome or a custom one
2018-11-26T17:40:16  <Justin_o> what do you think
2018-11-26T17:40:28  <jhung> Justin_o: I'm fine with including or dropping "icons" from the name. maybe include it to be explicit?
2018-11-26T17:40:33  <Justin_o> the other option would be to fix the collisions and or namespace the infusion ones
2018-11-26T17:41:39  <jhung> Justin_o: namespacing our own seems like a good thing to do regardless.
2018-11-26T17:42:23  <Justin_o> true.. like fluid-play
2018-11-26T17:42:29  <Justin_o> or infusion-play
2018-11-26T17:42:32  <Justin_o> for fl-play
2018-11-26T17:44:15  <Justin_o> for should have been or
2018-11-26T17:44:23  <jhung> infusion-play works. it would go nicely with the new output filenames,
2018-11-26T17:45:04  <Justin_o> okay so what did we say for file names?
2018-11-26T17:47:03  <jhung> lol
2018-11-26T17:47:25  <jhung> Justin_o: I think it was infusion-icons-all / only / fontAwesome
2018-11-26T17:47:43  <Justin_o> okay
2018-11-26T17:47:52  <Justin_o> can you rename the icons in the ai file
2018-11-26T17:47:55  <Justin_o> i'll rename them in the repo
2018-11-26T17:49:55  <jhung> ok so with the prefix "infusion-" Justin_o?
2018-11-26T17:50:06  <Justin_o> jhung: yes pease
2018-11-26T17:50:07  <Justin_o> please
2018-11-26T17:50:14  <Justin_o> jhung: what about the one you just added.. fluid-start
2018-11-26T17:50:24  <Justin_o> should that be left or renamed to infusion-fluid-star
2018-11-26T17:50:31  <Justin_o> or infusion-logo
2018-11-26T17:50:37  <Justin_o> or infusion-logo-star
2018-11-26T17:50:45  <jhung> infusion-logo-star makes sense.
2018-11-26T17:51:23  <Justin_o> or infusion-star-logo?
2018-11-26T17:51:33  <Justin_o> maybe logo-star is better
2018-11-26T17:52:34  <Justin_o> jhung: while we're renaming things.. maybe we should also rename the uploader icons
2018-11-26T17:52:55  <Justin_o> which are uploader-button-01 and etc
2018-11-26T17:52:59  <Justin_o> maybe to something more descriptive
2018-11-26T17:53:58  <jhung> ok I'll take a look at those Justin_o
