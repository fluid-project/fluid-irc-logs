2020-10-05T16:34:01  <Justin_o> sorry, on my way
2020-10-05T16:51:36  <colinclark> cherylhjli and sepidehshahi: Do you have a bit of time today to talk through some ideas for the Accessibility in Action project with me?
2020-10-05T16:52:13  <colinclark> I’m free after 330 pm today, but I know it’s short notice and you’re both super busy too—so we can also talk tomorrow if that’s easier
2020-10-05T16:52:36  <sepidehshahi> I’m available 3:40-4:30 if that works
2020-10-05T16:57:28  <cherylhjli> i'm free after 3:30!
2020-10-05T17:11:13  <colinclark> ok perfect!
2020-10-05T17:30:24  <gmoss> cindyli Justin_o: where had you planned on meeting?
2020-10-05T17:31:58  <cindyli> yes, gmoss

2020-10-05T17:32:54  <cindyli> Justin_o: we are in the stand up room
2020-10-05T18:11:09  <cherylhjli> hey sepidehshahi, danayo and I just talked to our new volunteer on the embedded co-design kit, Titania, about helping out with case studies
2020-10-05T18:12:50  <cherylhjli> she's done some work with organizations writing or co-writing their case studies - so if she's a resource you can leverage and not write all the case studies yourself, we can get you connected
2020-10-05T19:31:02  <cherylhjli> colinclark, where would you like to meet?
2020-10-05T19:31:05  <cherylhjli> also, hi tveda :)
