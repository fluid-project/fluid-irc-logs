2020-07-31T16:00:30  <colinclark> gmoss: Remind me if Google posts advice or guidelines for students about how to engage with communities?
2020-07-31T16:02:46  <gmoss> colinclark: I believe so... let me take a look
2020-07-31T16:03:07  <colinclark> thanks
2020-07-31T16:03:21  <colinclark> i’d like to have some links to share that are more general about etiquette etc.
2020-07-31T16:03:28  <gmoss> colinclark: at the very least, there's the mentors mailing list that we/you can send queries to, Stephanie Taylor (who runs GSoC) is usually very good at replying
2020-07-31T16:03:35  <gmoss> gotcha, i'll see what I can dig up
2020-07-31T16:03:48  <colinclark> yeah, i’m more hoping for good pre-wriitten advice for contributing
2020-07-31T16:04:00  <colinclark> especially guidelines that aren’t “old school” open source
2020-07-31T16:04:11  <colinclark> you probably know what I mean :)
2020-07-31T16:04:29  <colinclark> the sort of rtfm kind of stuff that was popular in the linux community etc.
2020-07-31T16:06:21  <gmoss> yep :)
2020-07-31T16:06:44  <gmoss> GSoC's docs and guidelines tend not to be that way, as far as I've seen
2020-07-31T16:07:06  <colinclark> right, exactly
2020-07-31T16:08:06  <gmoss> The student guide is a good place to start, I'm still reading through it to see if there are any specifics about etiquette, but here it is: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/
2020-07-31T16:09:08  <colinclark> this looks pretty good, yes
2020-07-31T16:09:20  <gmoss> again not specifically about etiquette, but includes links to the rules and FAQ pages: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/communication-best-practices
2020-07-31T16:21:39  <gmoss> cherylhjli or greatislander or someone else, I found a link on the wiki to a page on the IDRC site called "Get Involved", but it's returning a 404. Do you know off-hand if there's a new home for this page? https://idrc.ocadu.ca/index.php/about-the-idrc/getinvolved
2020-07-31T16:22:10  <gmoss> Trying to see if there's any IDRC- or Fluid Project-specific guidelines
2020-07-31T16:22:17  <greatislander> there is not
2020-07-31T16:22:29  <greatislander> it is on the road map
2020-07-31T16:22:41  <gmoss> greatislander: okay, thanks!
2020-07-31T16:22:43  <greatislander> https://github.com/inclusive-design/idrc/projects/2
2020-07-31T16:23:13  <gmoss> oo very neat
2020-07-31T16:25:22  <gmoss> colinclark: there's always the "Inclusion in the Fluid Community" page on the wiki: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusion+in+the+Fluid+Community
2020-07-31T16:26:10  <colinclark> yeah, not quite what I’m looking for
2020-07-31T16:26:19  <colinclark> but it is nice to have for some cases for sure
2020-07-31T16:26:26  <gmoss> yeah I'm having trouble finding anything that deals with this sort of situationm
2020-07-31T16:26:30  <colinclark> that’s ok
2020-07-31T16:26:38  <colinclark> i figured we didn’t have those sorts of resources ourselves
2020-07-31T16:26:42  <colinclark> they’re very hard to write
2020-07-31T16:26:43  <gmoss> mhmm
2020-07-31T16:26:47  <colinclark> because they require nuance
2020-07-31T16:26:52  <colinclark> and, particularly, social nuance
2020-07-31T16:27:02  <colinclark> for some engineers, that’s a difficult prospect :)
2020-07-31T16:27:18  <gmoss> I think the best bet is the GSoC student guide that encourages lurking for a bit rather than jumping in with PR's and Issues
2020-07-31T16:27:21  <gmoss> indeed
2020-07-31T16:27:41  <colinclark> that guide is pretty good, you’re right
2020-07-31T16:29:13  <gmoss> colinclark: maybe we should consider drafting something to address situations like this. it reminds me of what we saw in February, and it would be good to have something handy to point to
2020-07-31T16:30:10  <gmoss> maybe just amending the Get Involved page to include a bit more text around contribution etiquette
2020-07-31T16:30:25  <gmoss> cindyli: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-07-31T16:32:09  <cindyli> yes, gmoss
2020-07-31T16:32:19  <gmoss> cindyli: awesome :) I'm in the standup room
2020-07-31T16:32:34  <colinclark> I think I wrote something during the initial GSoC this period
2020-07-31T16:32:36  <colinclark> about what we expect
2020-07-31T16:32:43  <colinclark> getting to know our community first, etc.
2020-07-31T16:32:51  <colinclark> Perhaps that’s already in our wiki page
2020-07-31T16:32:56  <colinclark> if not, we could definitely add it
2020-07-31T16:34:18  <gmoss> colinclark: yeah that sounds like a very valuable thing to have, if it isn't already on a page
2020-07-31T16:42:16  <cindyli> gmoss: sjrk master has been merged into other production branches including karisma
2020-07-31T16:42:53  <cindyli> and all pushed up. let's wait for deployments to complete
2020-07-31T16:43:15  <gmoss> colinclark: the revisions we made to the GSoC page for this year are material, I think: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-07-31T16:43:15  <gmoss> Specifically the section "Read about Inclusion": https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project#GoogleSummerofCode2020withtheFluidProject-ReadaboutInclusion
2020-07-31T16:43:15  <gmoss> (just tell me if you want me to stop finding links :P)
2020-07-31T16:43:15  <gmoss> cindyli: awesome! I'll start testing as soon as that's done
2020-07-31T16:43:23  <gmoss> thanks :)
2020-07-31T16:44:44  <colinclark> yeah, totally gmoss
2020-07-31T17:10:18  <philip> Question to the ether: we have the accessible survey platforms workshop in the design crit slot on Tuesday, and a lightning talk from Gregor on Thursday. Have we established a preference that we do not want both a post-standup talk and a design crit-type thing on the same day?
2020-07-31T17:12:42  <gmoss> philip: that is an excellent question! my preference would be not to have both on the same day, but it isn't a strong preference
2020-07-31T17:13:21  <philip> I guess it's a leading question, gmoss :)
2020-07-31T17:14:18  <gmoss> philip: I suppose so :P I think the quick answer is "no, we haven't established a preference", btw
2020-07-31T17:15:04  <philip> Thanks gmoss. I think I will act as if we have for now
2020-07-31T20:35:52  <Teddy___> Uttara: do you have a minute to join me and Cindy in the we count room
