2020-07-09T12:51:52  <michelled> good morning Justin_o
2020-07-09T12:52:54  <michelled> good morning philip
2020-07-09T12:53:39  <Justin_o> michelled: hello
2020-07-09T12:54:09  <michelled> Justin_o: can you please add some details about what was done for UIO & UIO+ in the last year to the Floe report notes?
2020-07-09T13:01:08  <Justin_o> michelled: related to UIO+ release, based on Greggs timeline for winding down Morphic Classic. Sounds like there will be pilots through the summer still running Morphic Classic and I think there will be a re-install/update at some point to have them point to a different server. The problem right now is that if I update UIO+ it will break any new installs for the connection between it and morphic.
2020-07-09T13:01:50  <michelled> ok, Justin_o were no new features added from July 2019 to now?
2020-07-09T13:02:52  <michelled> for example, in last years report we said this:
2020-07-09T13:02:53  <michelled> The User Interface Options Chrome browser extension had several beta releases which included many bug fixes and new features such as:
2020-07-09T13:02:53  <michelled>     • new character spacing preference
2020-07-09T13:02:53  <michelled>     • new captions preference for embedded YouTube videos
2020-07-09T13:02:53  <michelled>     • new syllables preferences
2020-07-09T13:02:53  <michelled>     • additional low contrast themes (Gray on White, Black on Brown, Light Gray on Dark Gray)
2020-07-09T13:02:53  <michelled>     • the ability for Zoom to both increase and decrease the text size using the browsers zoom change inputs
2020-07-09T13:02:54  <michelled>     • improvements to the “Reading Mode”
2020-07-09T13:04:02  <Justin_o> michelled: it's basically the changes from v0.1.0-beta.12 and onwards. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/releases
2020-07-09T13:04:33  <Justin_o> mostly fixes, the only features added were the context menu, reset, and keyboard shortcut to open the adjuster panel
2020-07-09T13:04:46  <michelled> cool, thx
2020-07-09T13:05:18  <michelled> thx for updating the doc too! :)
2020-07-09T13:05:26  <Justin_o> no problem :)
2020-07-09T13:08:09  <Justin_o> michelled: there was also work on UIO/Prefs Framework in Infusion but those haven't been merged into master yet, but are in Bosmon's branch
2020-07-09T13:08:31  <michelled> ok, well, maybe that's for next year then
2020-07-09T13:08:36  <michelled> next year's repot
2020-07-09T13:08:43  <michelled> report
2020-07-09T13:10:13  <Justin_o> okay
2020-07-09T14:39:34  <greatislander> hi alanharnum, are you available to do a bit of review on some Directory PRs today?
2020-07-09T15:02:03  <michelled> hi philip
2020-07-09T15:02:53  <philip> Hi michelled. Looks like my IRC client is happy to show me as online when I'm not
2020-07-09T15:03:02  <michelled> ha, silly :)
2020-07-09T15:03:25  <philip> Is there something you'd like me to write up for the Floe report?
2020-07-09T15:03:45  <michelled> yep! :) I was hoping to get a little more detail on your Nexus work
2020-07-09T15:04:02  <michelled> and maybe a concrete example of what it would support in a learning context
2020-07-09T15:04:17  <philip> I had assumed it was not close enough to the realm of education (yet)
2020-07-09T15:05:13  <philip> But I can certainly write a little bit about the goal of letting students work with data in different modalities, extending the efforts of the previous Inclusive Science Lab demo
2020-07-09T15:05:31  <michelled> yeah, that would be great
2020-07-09T15:05:37  <michelled> just a couple sentences is all we need
2020-07-09T15:05:47  <michelled> Right now we've got "The Infusion Nexus is being updated to support personal data analytics projects"
2020-07-09T15:05:53  <michelled> which feels a little thin
2020-07-09T15:06:44  <philip> I'll flesh that out a little then
2020-07-09T15:07:58  <michelled> thanks philip, and if you've got a link to something that's always good
2020-07-09T15:08:09  <michelled> I'm not sure if you're at the point of having a regular demo build
2020-07-09T15:08:15  <michelled> or if you've got a demo video
2020-07-09T15:08:56  <michelled> hi danayo - I've got another floe report request :)
2020-07-09T15:16:09  <danayo> ok michelled!
2020-07-09T15:17:55  <michelled> danayo: can you put your Guide for Embedded Co-Design somewhere that I can link to it? I think you'll want to remove your email address from it first
2020-07-09T15:18:08  <michelled> the wiki would be fine
2020-07-09T15:21:07  <danayo> michelled: which guide are you referring to?
2020-07-09T15:21:39  <michelled> the one you sent around to platform coop partners
2020-07-09T15:21:50  <danayo> ah! ok
2020-07-09T15:22:10  <michelled> I didn't want to put something in the report with your email address in it - unless you wanted that
2020-07-09T15:25:01  <michelled> gmoss, do you have a list of the new features in the storytelling tool from the last year starting July 1, 2019
2020-07-09T15:25:25  <gmoss> michelled: I don't think I have such a list handy, but I can produce it
2020-07-09T15:25:27  <michelled> right now we are saying "Many improvements have been made to the Storytelling Tool in preparation for expanded use" but we should be more specific
2020-07-09T15:26:04  <gmoss> michelled: okay, should be able to find some time to whip that up today :)
2020-07-09T15:27:18  <michelled> great
2020-07-09T15:28:44  <danayo> got it michelled , it was the formal Word doc I sent out in relation to the REB. I’ll take my contact info out and think I’ll transfer it to a google doc
2020-07-09T15:29:24  <michelled> perfect!
2020-07-09T15:31:54  <colinclark> could it go in a wiki page, or is that too difficult because of formatting?
2020-07-09T15:35:37  <michelled> danayo: ^
2020-07-09T15:35:49  <danayo> colinclark: for sure!
2020-07-09T15:36:01  <danayo> a little more formatting but it’s fine
2020-07-09T15:36:08  <colinclark> only if it’s not inconvenience
2020-07-09T15:36:11  <colinclark> an inconvenience
2020-07-09T15:39:17  <michelled> cherylhjli, danayo, jhung: I was looking at the Floe resources and realized that we had started to organize these by themes - maybe it'll help with the new design https://floeproject.org/resources.html
2020-07-09T15:39:49  <danayo> good idea michelled
2020-07-09T15:40:52  <cherylhjli> thanks michelled!
2020-07-09T15:41:43  <danayo> colinclark, michelled where on the wiki do you recommend I put the guide?
2020-07-09T15:41:57  <colinclark> That’s a good question
2020-07-09T15:42:33  <michelled> maybe under this https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusive+Design+Toolkit
2020-07-09T15:42:50  <michelled> even though it came out of coop, I feel like we are going to take it into the future?
2020-07-09T15:42:54  <colinclark> yeah, that’s not a bad idea
2020-07-09T15:43:33  <danayo> for sure michelled
2020-07-09T15:43:40  <danayo> ok thanks michelled colinclark will do
2020-07-09T15:43:50  <michelled> thx!
2020-07-09T15:43:51  <colinclark> thank you!
2020-07-09T15:44:55  <greatislander> cindyli I am not sure if this is what you are looking for but I found this example code of how to edit ACF custom meta fields via the WordPress REST API: https://github.com/airesvsg/acf-to-rest-api-example
2020-07-09T15:45:02  <greatislander> We can discuss more at the meeting though
2020-07-09T15:45:31  <cindyli> super, greatislander. i'll have a look
2020-07-09T16:08:35  <alanharnum> greatislander:  sure - this one here? https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/138
2020-07-09T16:09:27  <greatislander> alanharnum: I actually went ahead and merged them— that one needs Eric's input specifically. so no worries. I will probably ask you to look at the summary of impact PR I am working on once it is done.
2020-07-09T16:09:45  <alanharnum> greatislander: ok!
2020-07-09T16:31:21  <danayo> gmoss: are you still in the laser checklist meeting?
2020-07-09T16:33:16  <gmoss> danayo: sorry I had to step away from my computer for a few minutes there. it's all wrapped up, I'm ready to meet about the storytelling tool now
2020-07-09T16:33:28  <gmoss> cindyli colinclark Justin_o michelled are you ready to meet now as well?

2020-07-09T17:43:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome. talk to you then

2020-07-09T18:00:40  <jhung> gmoss sure. Let's see if the Standup room is free.

2020-07-09T18:11:35  <greatislander> michelled Colin had sent him an email yesterday about hosting suggesting we discuss during our time slot and he didn't respond
2020-07-09T18:11:48  <greatislander> if Colin is not available I don't want to have that conversation without him.

2020-07-09T19:31:22  <cindyli> thanks
2020-07-09T20:13:37  <cherylhjli> greatislander - did you still want to meet with danayo and I? we're done our meeting now so I'm free, not sure about danayo
2020-07-09T20:14:05  <greatislander> es please
2020-07-09T20:14:11  <greatislander> *yes please
2020-07-09T20:15:01  <greatislander> cindyli I sent you an Airtable invite link
2020-07-09T20:15:05  <greatislander> so you can experiment
2020-07-09T20:15:19  <greatislander> If you create a base, then visit `/api` you can test out the API for it
2020-07-09T20:15:41  <cindyli> thanks, greatislander
2020-07-09T20:16:01  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo I have joined the co-op room, come by whenever :)
2020-07-09T20:16:31  <danayo> ok
2020-07-09T20:39:30  <cindyli> greatislander: did you send the Airtable invite to my ocadu email? I didn't receive it
2020-07-09T20:39:40  <greatislander> cli@ocadu.ca, right?
2020-07-09T20:39:47  <cindyli> that's right
2020-07-09T20:39:49  <greatislander> hmmm
2020-07-09T20:39:50  <greatislander> weir
2020-07-09T20:39:51  <greatislander> d
2020-07-09T20:39:56  <greatislander> check your spam maybe?
2020-07-09T20:40:10  <cindyli> checked, not in junk mail
2020-07-09T20:40:26  <cindyli> do i need an invite to play with its API, greatislander
2020-07-09T20:40:42  <greatislander> you need to sign up for a free account and create a base
2020-07-09T20:40:51  <greatislander> hang on
2020-07-09T21:33:26  <cherylhjli> greatislander - danayo and I noticed that currently on the directory site, my profiles is just a page rather than a dropdown
2020-07-09T21:33:39  <cherylhjli> did we have a conversation already where we decided to keep it all on the page, instead of making that drop down menu?
2020-07-09T21:33:41  <greatislander> correct, I discussed this with Dana a while back
2020-07-09T21:33:46  <cherylhjli> ahh
2020-07-09T21:34:04  <greatislander> because we don't have the ability to include items in dropdowns that aren't links without new design/css work
2020-07-09T21:34:26  <greatislander> it was a conversation that maybe wasn't documented
2020-07-09T21:34:30  <danayo> thanks for refreshing mh memory greatislander !
2020-07-09T21:34:38  <greatislander> no problem :)
2020-07-09T21:34:43  <cherylhjli> thanks!
