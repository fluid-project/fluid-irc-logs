2018-09-25T14:16:14  <danayo> jhung: that sounds great
2018-09-25T14:17:18  <danayo> and makes so much sense - since we had so many discussions with them about semantic structure and relation to the keypad
2018-09-25T14:29:19  <jhung> yeah. Maybe we can start talking about how the keypad was created, then I can segue into my trip to the museum and seeing the keypad and inclusive exhibits there.
2018-09-25T14:29:23  <jhung> ^danayo
2018-09-25T14:31:36  <danayo> sounds good jhung

2018-09-25T16:56:55  <clown> carenwatkins_:  did it work for you?  I can't get the applet to run.
2018-09-25T16:59:54  <carenwatkins_> no didn't get it to work clown but knowing about this work is awesome (I'm relativly new so will be learning about a lot of what you guys have done over the years) Word prediction is so so helpful in the learning enviro and is a crucial inclusive tool!
2018-09-25T17:02:55  <carenwatkins_> ...and the clown on your page!! You should get a button made with that and wear it a the open house :-)
2018-09-25T17:03:43  <clown> carenwatkins_:  at the time, word prediction tools were available for PCs (and maybe Macs) but somone at Sun contacted us and said "how's about showing a demo of word prediction using Java?)
