2020-07-14T15:27:03  <danayo> colinclark, michelled it occurred to me that that Guide for Embedded Co-design wiki page probably needs a definition up top of what exactly we mean by embedded co-design
2020-07-14T15:27:18  <colinclark> Yes :)
2020-07-14T15:27:31  <colinclark> even, perhaps, a better name—I’m not sure
2020-07-14T15:27:34  <danayo> yes
2020-07-14T15:27:57  <danayo> I’m not sure either, but agree it’s worth considering
2020-07-14T15:28:24  <danayo> Community-led?
2020-07-14T15:29:11  <danayo> anyways I’ll put together a short definition colinclark and run it by you
2020-07-14T15:29:18  <danayo> I think I wrote something up in emails to partners
2020-07-14T15:31:52  <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning will start soon

2020-07-14T15:36:52  <alanharnum> michelled: I'm getting a password prompt for the Zoom room from the calendar link,  guessing I missed something being updated?
2020-07-14T15:38:49  <michelled> Justin_o: is there a password?
