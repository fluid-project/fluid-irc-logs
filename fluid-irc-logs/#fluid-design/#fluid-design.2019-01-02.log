2019-01-02T16:14:37  <danayo> hello cherylhjli!
2019-01-02T16:15:17  <cherylhjli> Hi danayo! :)
2019-01-02T16:16:05  <danayo> happy new year! how’s it going?
2019-01-02T16:16:26  <danayo> hope you got settled in well before the holidays
2019-01-02T16:17:34  <cherylhjli> yes! Did lots of reading on platform coop and the inclusive design guide.
2019-01-02T16:17:48  <cherylhjli> would love to pick your brain today about platform coop
2019-01-02T16:19:39  <danayo> for sure cherylhjli - how about we meet at 12:30 T.O. time? does that work for you?
2019-01-02T16:19:51  <cherylhjli> works for me!
2019-01-02T16:20:15  <danayo> great

2019-01-02T16:23:08  <colinclark> Happy new year, danayo and cherylhjli!
2019-01-02T16:23:32  <colinclark> I'm glad to hear you two will check in about the PCDK work today
2019-01-02T16:24:04  <colinclark> I was thinking that when Michelle is back next week, we'll organize daily standups for the project and do some iteration planning
2019-01-02T16:25:01  <colinclark> but in the meantime, I think our biggest priority is to explore some more focused design options for the PCC website for Trebor to consider.
2019-01-02T16:25:42  <colinclark> danayo, did you ever hear back from Namya about your SEWA website mockups?
2019-01-02T16:30:25  <danayo> hi colinclark! happy new year!
2019-01-02T16:30:56  <danayo> I haven’t heard from Namya at all colinclark
2019-01-02T16:31:11  <colinclark> how odd
2019-01-02T16:31:15  <danayo> yeah
2019-01-02T16:40:22  <danayo> colinclark: don’t know if you saw my message in Vidyo but let me know if I can help with that PC report at all
2019-01-02T16:40:34  <colinclark> thanks so much
2019-01-02T16:40:41  <colinclark> i'll write something up in the wiki and then you can review it
2019-01-02T16:41:05  <colinclark> I think it should be fairly straightforward—just adding to our last quarterly update
2019-01-02T16:41:10  <danayo> great, sounds good
2019-01-02T16:42:46  <danayo> cherylhjli, colinclark: did avtar give you any links to his platform coop site mockups or sketches?
2019-01-02T16:49:14  <cherylhjli> danayo: yep, Avtar sent me his working files in sketch
2019-01-02T16:50:37  <cherylhjli> I do not have a sketch license (my trial has expired)j but I can still open them in Adobe XD
2019-01-02T16:50:41  <danayo> ah - I think I just found the email cherylhjli
2019-01-02T16:50:57  <cherylhjli> https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/rZt4WPvTpkDTtwP
2019-01-02T16:51:12  <cherylhjli> mobile version: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/rp0caUu6NzUXPXB
2019-01-02T16:51:41  <danayo> thanks cherylhjli - I don’t have Sketch either :(
2019-01-02T16:51:50  <colinclark> cherylhjli: We included some Sketch licenses in a new grant proposal budget
2019-01-02T16:52:01  <colinclark> but in the meantime I'll see what we can do about getting a couple now
2019-01-02T16:55:30  <cherylhjli> that'd be great, thanks colinclark!
2019-01-02T17:00:25  <danayo> thanks colinclark
