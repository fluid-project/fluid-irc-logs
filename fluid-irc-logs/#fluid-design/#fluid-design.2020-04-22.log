2020-04-22T16:03:11  <cherylhjli> but I do want to add that I know we were supposed to have a copy session today, but I think we can push that to next week due to 1. wellness wednesdays and 2. haven't finished all the feedback sessions yet

2020-04-22T18:35:42  <michelled> Teddy___, gtirloni, greatislander, cindyli1: the wecount site is showing the dev data again
2020-04-22T18:35:47  <michelled> https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views
2020-04-22T18:35:52  <michelled> any ideas on why?
2020-04-22T18:36:03  <michelled> https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/
2020-04-22T18:36:41  <michelled> we saw this yesterday too, but it resolved itself
2020-04-22T18:36:54  <Teddy___> Me and Cindy noticed that earlier today while on a call but it resolved itself
2020-04-22T18:37:17  <michelled> there must be a setting somewhere that we need to fix
2020-04-22T18:39:06  <colinclark> yikes
2020-04-22T18:40:20  <michelled> yesterday I saw the issue very briefly right around the time when I was having issues loading the site and gtirloni had mentioned issues with netlify. I couldn't recreate it later so assumed it was related
2020-04-22T18:40:25  <michelled> but this doesn't seem like it is
2020-04-22T18:40:45  <cindyli1> greatislander: These test posts only exist in the dev WP site https://wecount-dev.inclusivedesign.ca/ but not in the production WP. seems there's a deploy problem at checking the flag of "production" or "dev" - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/assets/config.js#L12
2020-04-22T18:41:28  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-04-22T18:41:33  <michelled> cindyli1: if you look at the root site, you can see it's the dev site being deployed at the moment
2020-04-22T18:41:49  <cindyli> good to know
2020-04-22T18:42:17  <cindyli> unfortunately, i don't know how to redeploy :(
2020-04-22T18:42:29  <greatislander> the strange thing about this is it appears the first time you load, then if you refresh the page it shows the production data.
2020-04-22T18:42:49  <greatislander> I’m honestly quite confused.
2020-04-22T18:42:55  <cindyli> greatislander: is it because the static pages are generated using dev data?
2020-04-22T18:43:32  <greatislander> could be, I supposed? But that doesn’t really make sense because the store uses the same endpoint as the generate routine
2020-04-22T18:43:54  <michelled> oh! no wonder I couldn't reproduce :(
2020-04-22T18:44:11  <cindyli> greatislander: to check, i think you can check index.html files in the "dist" dir on the production server
2020-04-22T18:44:34  <greatislander> I’m on my phone walking the dog right now but will look when I get back
2020-04-22T18:44:51  <cindyli> cool. thanks, greatislander
2020-04-22T18:46:04  <greatislander> I feel pretty frustrated with Nuxt, to be honest. It seems like it’s a lot more complicated than we need/than it needs to be. This hybrid static/client-side model feels really unintuitive to me and I’d like to discuss this further tomorrow.
2020-04-22T18:46:26  <greatislander> </rant> :)
2020-04-22T18:47:40  <colinclark> greatislander: I hear your rant :)
2020-04-22T18:48:18  <colinclark> and thanks for taking the time to look into it, even while juggling everything else
2020-04-22T18:48:19  <greatislander> erictheise jhung can we push the Django training back 30 min? Need to put out a fire when I get back from walking Aisha
2020-04-22T18:49:20  <jhung> greatislander I'm fine with that.
2020-04-22T18:49:42  <erictheise> checking my calendar, hang on.
2020-04-22T18:50:20  <greatislander> :)
2020-04-22T18:51:34  <erictheise> should be okay greatislander, jhung, may need to start a few minutes late. things I was going to do afterward need to get done before.
2020-04-22T18:52:19  <jhung> ok
2020-04-22T18:53:06  <michelled> alanharnum: I think you were also interested in the django training - it'll be starting later because of a wecount website fire

2020-04-22T19:24:35  <greatislander> cindyli michelled Teddy___ I've removed the dev/production API code and now all branches are building from the production backend. Can I get you to test for this weird behaviour again and see if it's working for you? Seems to be working for me
2020-04-22T19:25:43  <cindyli> https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views looks good to me. thanks, greatislander
2020-04-22T19:26:14  <greatislander> cindyli we are back to where we started in terms of the dev deploys, unfortunately. I have reopened the ticket.
2020-04-22T19:27:13  <cindyli> greatislander: understand. it's the quickest fix we could put in
2020-04-22T19:28:15  <Teddy___> Works for me as well
2020-04-22T19:28:47  <Teddy___> It is also very strange that it is just the views page using the dev data
2020-04-22T19:29:01  <greatislander> I was also seeing the same issue on the home page periodically
2020-04-22T19:29:04  <Teddy___> for the home page was still pulling from production

2020-04-22T21:06:24  <greatislander> could do Monday from 9-10 pacific if that works?
