2020-06-17T14:24:04  <greatislander> danayo and cherylhjli, are you available to look at something?

2020-06-17T14:31:28  <cherylhjli> coop room greatislander?
2020-06-17T14:31:32  <greatislander> yep
2020-06-17T14:52:52  <carenwatkins_> Hi jhung: am I able to access the Handbook to make changes to some content?
2020-06-17T14:54:28  <jhung> carenwatkins_ yes you can. I'd have to walk you through the process though.
2020-06-17T14:56:31  <carenwatkins_> Ah, ok, jhung. Do you have time this afternoon or tomorrow?
2020-06-17T14:56:58  <jhung> How about tomorrow carenwatkins_ ?
2020-06-17T14:57:51  <carenwatkins_> sure, what time works for you jhung ?
2020-06-17T14:58:23  <jhung> Early morning or after lunch 1p-2p works.
2020-06-17T15:00:14  <carenwatkins_> Let's grab 1pm tomorrow jhung. I'll try to make a guide so it is documented and I can follow it in the future! Thank you
2020-06-17T15:00:28  <jhung> sounds good carenwatkins_
2020-06-17T15:53:56  <cherylhjli> alanharnum did you want to check in with the coop team? cc greatislander danayo
2020-06-17T15:53:59  <cherylhjli> jhung
2020-06-17T15:54:05  <greatislander> yep, one sec
2020-06-17T15:56:02  <michelled> cherylhjli: coop room?
2020-06-17T16:04:13  <danayo> cherylhjli, michelled and all sorry to miss checkin - have to leave for an appointment now
2020-06-17T16:04:59  <danayo> gmoss: I’ll have to miss storytelling checkin today as well
2020-06-17T16:05:21  <gmoss> danayo: no worries. Today seems to be shaping up to be a very GSoC day anyway :)
2020-06-17T16:05:29  <gmoss> for me, that is
2020-06-17T16:31:24  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-06-17T16:31:35  <gmoss> probably a quick one
2020-06-17T16:31:43  <michelled> I'm not at the moment gmoss
2020-06-17T16:31:59  <michelled> if it's quick, want to just update here?
2020-06-17T16:32:09  <gmoss> michelled: sure
2020-06-17T16:35:41  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: quick update - yesterday I solved the CSS issues we mentioned, I added some aria-labels to the new buttons, tested with NVDA (which we discussed a little in here yesterday), reviewed danayo's updates to the "How-to" story, and finally added some more tests. Today I'm going to add a few more tests and start updating the how-to story
2020-06-17T16:36:39  <Justin_o> gmoss: my other meeting just finished but I guess there won't be a story telling meeting anyways... however, what was the issue that you and dana ran into yesterday?
2020-06-17T16:36:48  <michelled> sounds good gmoss - when are you expecting to be ready to do the release?
2020-06-17T16:39:40  <gmoss> Justin_o: it was relating to UIO and disabled buttons, iirc
2020-06-17T16:39:40  <gmoss> michelled: considering I also intend to do some GSoC stuff today, I don't think it will be ready for merging today. I'll still need to do the minimal testing at that point, so I think Friday, but I suppose if history has been an indication, Monday might be a better choice
2020-06-17T16:51:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you get everything merged tomorrow let me know and I can help with some of the testing.
2020-06-17T16:52:16  <gmoss> Justin_o: that would be great, thanks!
2020-06-17T16:52:22  <gmoss> I'll keep you posted
2020-06-17T16:56:07  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, I'll be away on Friday as usual but will be around tomorrow and Monday.
2020-06-17T18:34:35  <erictheise> greatislander is there anyway to get laravel to reuse the same brower tab on restart? removing font awesome broke the api and (temporarily) and I inadvertently opened a half dozen “Welcome” windows before realizing there was a new migration.
2020-06-17T18:35:00  <greatislander> There's a way to keep it from opening a new window, hang on
2020-06-17T18:37:30  <greatislander> @erictheise, replace line 5 of `webpack.mix.js` with:
2020-06-17T18:37:34  <greatislander> ```
2020-06-17T18:37:34  <greatislander> mix.browserSync({
2020-06-17T18:37:34  <greatislander>     proxy: 'localhost:8000',
2020-06-17T18:37:34  <greatislander>     open: false
2020-06-17T18:37:34  <greatislander> });
2020-06-17T18:37:35  <greatislander> ```
2020-06-17T18:37:44  <greatislander> then restarting won't open a new window
2020-06-17T18:38:22  <erictheise> will give it a try, greatislander, thanks.
2020-06-17T18:38:56  <greatislander> no prob. I'm committing this change to dev right now as well, it's been an annoyance that I've been ignoring.
