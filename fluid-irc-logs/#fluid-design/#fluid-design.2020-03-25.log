2020-03-25T14:28:35  <sepidehshahi> Hi philip and danayo, I went over the old MyL3 files this morning to refresh my mind about them. Is there anything in particular that youâ€™d like to talk about today? How can I help?
2020-03-25T14:34:30  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: danayo)
2020-03-25T14:39:28  <philip> Hi sepidehshahi, to begin with I'd just like to hear a bit about the history and thinking behind the design. For the discussion, I'm particularly interested in talking about what a collective-oriented MyL3 might look like, i.e. how multiple people might co-reflect, or occupy different roles in a reflective learning process
2020-03-25T14:43:04  <sepidehshahi> For sure philip. When I was working on MyL3 we were focusing more on an individual and self-reflection. Co-reflection sounds very interesting, Iâ€™m looking forward to the conversation today
2020-03-25T14:43:52  <philip> Me too :)

2020-03-25T15:27:38  <danayo> Iâ€™ll try to pick out some mockups to show (there are a lot!)

2020-03-25T16:41:27  <erictheise> greatislander it was actually an easy day of flying. little bit of weirdness getting food at DFW but the local chain that has decent barbecue and is not chik-fil-a or other national chain was open. and BART is shutting down at 9p these days so I had to fork over for a lyft.

2020-03-25T18:06:16  <sepidehshahi> danayo: I think you have captured everything in the doc, I just added a lik to the latest designs
2020-03-25T18:07:22  <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi thatâ€™s great, I was thinking that the latest designs might be a bit too detailed to address fully today, what do you think?
2020-03-25T18:07:37  <danayo> but that we should mention some of the developments there
2020-03-25T18:09:23  <danayo> I was finding that some of the older mockups show various concepts in simpler ways (for purposes of our discussion)
2020-03-25T18:09:38  <sepidehshahi> I totally agree, I wasnâ€™t even sure if we wanted to talk about the designs at all. maybe just talking about the ideas and reasoning behind those designs? Iâ€™m open to anything
2020-03-25T18:09:56  <sepidehshahi> For sure danayo
2020-03-25T18:10:07  <danayo> I agree, I think with the time we have thatâ€™s the best approach. We can use the mockups for reference in the summary and discussion
