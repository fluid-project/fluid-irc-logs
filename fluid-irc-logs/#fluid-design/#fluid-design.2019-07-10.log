2019-07-10T15:43:08  <greatislander> Do we want to have our co-op standup once cherylhjli and danayo_ are off the call with Stephanie?
2019-07-10T15:43:23  <jhung> works for me greatislander
2019-07-10T15:43:31  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.102> has joined #fluid-design
2019-07-10T15:44:05  <greatislander> michelled I just suggested we have our co-op standup after cherylhjli and danayo_ finish their call with Stephanie in 15 minutes
2019-07-10T15:44:12  <greatislander> Let me know what you think
2019-07-10T15:45:09  <michelled> sounds good!
2019-07-10T15:45:31  <michelled> jhung: Knowledge Platform is what we are making in Bodies in Translation
2019-07-10T15:46:15  <jhung> michelled thanks! The terms are blending in my head.
2019-07-10T15:46:25  <michelled> understandably!
2019-07-10T15:46:38  <michelled> who knows, maybe Trebor would like that name :)
2019-07-10T15:47:22  <greatislander> jhung we also have a Labour Platform so there's a bit more to muddy the aters
2019-07-10T15:47:25  <greatislander> *waters
2019-07-10T15:49:14  <jhung> haha... I think we need more projects with the word "framework" in it. Seems like we're good on "platforms". :)
2019-07-10T15:49:58  <greatislander> lol
2019-07-10T15:53:16  <gmoss> "The framework formerly known as Labour Platform"
2019-07-10T15:54:35  <jhung> lol
2019-07-10T15:56:47  <cherylhjli> ack, all these names! I struggle with them all too
2019-07-10T15:57:11  <cherylhjli> "Learning Launchpad" came to me in an attempt at alliteration one day
2019-07-10T15:57:23  <cherylhjli> anyways, danayo_ and I are done our call. We can meet in say.. 5 min?
2019-07-10T15:57:36  <danayo_> just about enough time to make coffee!!
2019-07-10T15:57:38  <danayo_> :)
2019-07-10T15:57:41  <michelled> yep!
2019-07-10T15:59:05  <greatislander> Sounds good!
2019-07-10T15:59:19  <greatislander> michelled your Vidyo room okay?
2019-07-10T15:59:45  <michelled> yup!

2019-07-10T17:08:09  <avtar> ok, hanging up
