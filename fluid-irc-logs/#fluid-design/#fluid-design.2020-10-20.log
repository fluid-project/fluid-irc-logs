2020-10-20T15:31:35  <danayo> fluid-everyone: I’m in a meeting with my WeCount group, will be late to planning
2020-10-20T16:09:11  <Justin_o> danayo: did you want to meet nowish for storytelling or after the crit?
2020-10-20T16:12:06  <gmoss> danayo Justin_o michelled: I'm good to meet now if that's good for everyone, though before or after the crit are equally good on my end
2020-10-20T16:17:37  <danayo> gmoss just wrapping up my meeting

2020-10-20T16:19:03  <sepidehshahi> Hi cherylhjli and greatislander I missed the debrief after our meeting yesterday. Is there anything particular I should be aware of? I went through all the docs Katie shared yesterday
2020-10-20T16:19:20  <Justin_o> danayo: if it's a bit rushed for you now, I don't mind to meet after the crit.
2020-10-20T16:20:24  <danayo> gmoss, Justin_o, michelled how about we meet now for a bit to check in and then figure out when/if to meet again later
2020-10-20T16:20:28  <danayo> i’m done my other meeting
2020-10-20T16:20:34  <gmoss> Sounds good :)
