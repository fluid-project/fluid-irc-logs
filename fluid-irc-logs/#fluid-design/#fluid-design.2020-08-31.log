2020-08-31T19:33:56  <cindyli> philip_: are you coming to the wecount check in today?
2020-08-31T20:37:47  <cindyli> hi philip_, as i rmb, things we need Vera for are: 1. prioritize the map work and the website work; 2. prioritize accessibility features for assessment centre data collection. is that all? i feel i forget one thing
2020-08-31T20:39:02  <philip_> That's all I remember too. Regarding accessibility feature prioritization, I meant that I'd like for Vera to participate in that discussion
2020-08-31T20:39:20  <philip_> *cindyli
2020-08-31T20:39:26  <cindyli> ok. thanks
2020-08-31T20:40:21  <cindyli> philip_: do you mean participate in the discussion about what accessibility features should be included in the data collection?
2020-08-31T20:41:05  <cindyli> would it be a discussion outside of tech checkins?
2020-08-31T20:41:33  <philip_> cindyli: When and how they should be included in data collection yeah. I think the tech checkin is the right environment for that discussion
2020-08-31T20:42:07  <cindyli> cool. thanks, philip_
2020-08-31T20:42:29  <philip_> np, cindyli
