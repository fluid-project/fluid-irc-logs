2020-02-07T14:38:28  <simonjb> I made this quick hack last night: https://colouryear.now.sh/
2020-02-07T14:38:43  <simonjb> it's a clock that counts from colour #000000 at the start of the year to colour #FFFFFF at the end of the year. the clock increments approx every 1.9 seconds (year/16,777,216)
2020-02-07T14:39:26  <simonjb> I'll clean up the code and add some improvements (such as calculating the text colour automatically for the background colour) and put it up on GitHub this weekend
2020-02-07T14:39:26  <danielcho> oo that's awesome! :)
2020-02-07T14:47:39  <simonjb> thanks :)

2020-02-07T17:41:44  <greatislander> cherylhjli Turns out I had to figure out that "allow the background color of the container to be used as a border color" issue in order to fix the problem jhung pointed out, so, I did
2020-02-07T17:41:50  <greatislander> no need to open a ticket after all
