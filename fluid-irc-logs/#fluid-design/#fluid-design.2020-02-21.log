2020-02-21T20:00:31  <greatislander> Hi jhung! Sorry, was out this morning. I could check in if needed? I saw you opened a PR, just looking at it now.
2020-02-21T20:02:44  <jhung> greatislander no worries. I started a PR for it.
2020-02-21T20:03:07  <greatislander> I'm just looking now. I found a bug which prevented the home layout from rendering, pushing a commit in the same branch for that.
2020-02-21T20:03:18  <jhung> ok
2020-02-21T20:04:06  <greatislander> Ah, I see the issue
2020-02-21T20:04:17  <greatislander> Okay so your fix address the problem with cards but it has this side effect:
2020-02-21T20:05:20  <greatislander> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/E3bEMinL/feed%20header
2020-02-21T20:05:35  <jhung> Ah.
2020-02-21T20:06:57  <greatislander> I think we can fix it by restoring the flex layout but ensuring that it's only applied to the header that is a direct descendent of `.home__feed`, e.g.
2020-02-21T20:07:11  <jhung> Yeah. I was thinking that.
2020-02-21T20:07:13  <greatislander> ```
2020-02-21T20:07:13  <greatislander> .home__feed > header { /* Rules. */ }
2020-02-21T20:07:13  <greatislander> ```
2020-02-21T20:07:42  <greatislander> Just pushed
2020-02-21T20:09:32  <jhung> testing it now.
2020-02-21T20:10:33  <greatislander> great!
2020-02-21T20:12:18  <greatislander> Looking good on my end
2020-02-21T20:15:52  <jhung> greatislander confirmed working. You can go and merge that
2020-02-21T20:15:55  <greatislander> Awesome!
2020-02-21T20:16:03  <greatislander> Another thing you can start looking at is https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-library/pull/193
2020-02-21T20:16:33  <jhung> ok
2020-02-21T20:16:54  <greatislander> There's a couple outstanding todos but the core functionality is there. Once you check it out, run `npm install` and `npm run build:production`, you'll need to create a page called 'Saved searches' and assign the 'Saved Searches' template to it to view the saved searches.
2020-02-21T20:17:11  <greatislander> I'll add some testing notes

2020-02-21T20:18:47  <greatislander> Teddy__ hey! Thanks for the detailed explanation on https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/68.
2020-02-21T20:19:17  <greatislander> I'd like to find a solution that avoids the need for an extra wrapper but I am happy to approve the PR as is.
2020-02-21T20:20:54  <Teddy__> Okay sounds good
2020-02-21T20:21:04  <Teddy__> About to go for lunch
2020-02-21T20:21:21  <Teddy__> Free to meet if need to when I get back
2020-02-21T20:22:36  <greatislander> Okay!
2020-02-21T20:22:42  <greatislander> Actually I'm going to make one change and then merge
2020-02-21T20:22:54  <greatislander> The NewsItem link should be within the `<h2>`
2020-02-21T20:23:15  <greatislander> so, `<h2><a ..>` rather than `<a ..><h2>`
2020-02-21T20:23:26  <Teddy__> Okay awesome
