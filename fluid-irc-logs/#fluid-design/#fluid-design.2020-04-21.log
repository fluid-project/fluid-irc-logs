2020-04-21T17:04:32  <gmoss> danayo: one thing I meant to mention in our check-in but forgot was SJRK-342, which is for contrast themes to apply to the AIHEC logo (they don't, currently). Their SVG file is basically just PNG data shoved into an SVG container, so I can't just add a fill colour like I usually do. Do you feel this is something I should prioritize?

2020-04-21T17:13:21  <danayo> gmoss: I wouldn’t prioritize it over the auto-save work right now. I’ll request an svg logo file in the meantime. How long would it take to fix it if we had the appropriate image file?
2020-04-21T17:13:42  <gmoss> danayo: I'd estimate that fix at 2 hours maximum, probably more like 30 mins
2020-04-21T17:13:49  <gmoss> assuming I had a properly-formatted SVG
2020-04-21T17:13:53  <danayo> ok
2020-04-21T17:15:26  <gmoss> danayo colinclark michelled: I triggered a manual rebuild of the AIHEC site, the welcome page is now the landing page. I realized that the server no longer restarts itself because it isn't crashing any more, and a restart is required for config changes to take effect

2020-04-21T18:32:32  <jhung> erictheise no worries. Can we reschedule the meeting for tomorrow?
2020-04-21T18:32:50  <erictheise> sure, we (me, jhung, greatlslander) can meet up at the same time tomorrow.
2020-04-21T18:33:09  <jhung> great. thanks erictheise
2020-04-21T18:34:06  <erictheise> jhung, you can record the meeting right?
2020-04-21T18:34:19  <jhung> yep.

2020-04-21T18:56:39  <gmoss> danayo: I'm still ideating about file autosaving for the storytelling tool, and I'm considering a process that will immediately upload any selected file to the server, then use that uploaded copy for the preview. What do you think about having a progress indicator in place of the preview while it's still uploading? This is very similar to the way Facebook handles posting photos or videos
2020-04-21T18:56:52  <erictheise> there was a Directory Icon review today cherylhjli & danayo?
2020-04-21T18:57:31  <cherylhjli> erictheise yep there was, you can see the icons here under "directory": https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Q4OwSPK9RYBb3SZ
2020-04-21T18:57:57  <michelled> Teddy___, cindyli: I think we'd best delete the test posts from the wecount site https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views
2020-04-21T18:58:06  <gtirloni> michelled: it looks like netlify might be having some trouble -- https://www.netlifystatus.com
2020-04-21T18:58:08  <michelled> I was going to suggest Jutta put her slides up there
2020-04-21T18:59:26  <Teddy___> That was very strange the test post are gone now
2020-04-21T18:59:48  <michelled> !
2020-04-21T19:00:44  <Teddy___> The website was always loading for me but with the test posts. Now I’m the test posts are gone. Maybe someone is working on it
2020-04-21T19:00:56  <Teddy___> Anyways everything looks good now
2020-04-21T19:02:04  <michelled> yeah, it's loading fine for me now
2020-04-21T19:03:57  <michelled> Teddy___: shall we check in?
2020-04-21T19:05:00  <Teddy___> Yep
2020-04-21T19:05:00  <danayo> gmoss: when you say in place of the preview, you mean it will open the preview once it has finished uploading, yes?
2020-04-21T19:05:11  <Teddy___> We count room in 5 min?
2020-04-21T19:05:16  <michelled> yup
2020-04-21T19:05:57  <gmoss> danayo: yeah that's what I was envisioning :) currently, the preview is loaded from the user's machine
2020-04-21T19:06:34  <gmoss> danayo: so I would choose a file, I would see a progress indicator, and then once the upload finishes, the progress indicator goes away and the preview is downloaded

2020-04-21T19:21:43  <danayo> gmoss: I’m not clear on which “preview” you mean, I guess. You’re not refering to the overall story preview, rather, previewing the image within the editor?
2020-04-21T19:22:00  <gmoss> danayo: sorry! I meant the individual preview for that block only
2020-04-21T19:22:16  <danayo> got it gmoss
2020-04-21T19:22:37  <gmoss> but, as a consequence, the images in the story preview would also be loaded from the server, but the upload would hopefully be done by that point (i suppose I could add a new image and jump ahead to the preview right away)
2020-04-21T19:22:48  <danayo> right gmoss
2020-04-21T19:22:53  <danayo> seems unlikely, but posssible
2020-04-21T19:23:03  <gmoss> something for me to consider, at least :)
2020-04-21T19:23:12  <danayo> your suggestion sounds good to me: having a progress indicator in place of the preview while it's still uploading
2020-04-21T19:23:24  <danayo> within the block
2020-04-21T19:23:24  <gmoss> danayo: great. I'll keep rolling with that idea
2020-04-21T19:23:27  <danayo> ok
2020-04-21T19:28:27  <gmoss> danayo: I might have some more considerations to share; I'll add them to the "design questions" tab in the priorities doc

2020-04-21T20:50:56  <cindyli> gmoss: i saw your update on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-289 about auto saving the story and any associated files on the server. my concern is, the auto save happens at every model change, which means, every letter the user types into the story will trigger a trip to the server. depending on the connection, this might trigger performance issues such as lagging
2020-04-21T20:51:51  <gmoss> cindyli: indeed, i was thinking about implementing some debouncing, or potentially continuing to use the localStorage autosave, and an autosave to server every X minutes, for instance
2020-04-21T20:52:20  <gmoss> and my plan was to share the files to the server only when a change is made to that field, so changes to text don't try to re-upload files
2020-04-21T20:52:32  <cindyli> ya, i'm thinking the same. we could still save the string content to the local storage but save uploaded files to the server
2020-04-21T20:52:58  <cindyli> the href for media blocks auto saved can point to the href from the server
2020-04-21T20:53:37  <gmoss> cindyli: yep that's the plan :) so this would mean no more blob manipulation on the client side, the image rotation can move to the server if we want, etc.
2020-04-21T20:53:52  <gmoss> compression, file resizing, etc can also be implemented later on, in that case
2020-04-21T20:54:02  <cindyli> ok. cool. great you have thought about it
2020-04-21T20:54:09  <gmoss> :)
