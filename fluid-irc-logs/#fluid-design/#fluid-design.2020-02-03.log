2020-02-03T16:24:23  <jhung> ok Justin_o good to know.
2020-02-03T16:24:41  <Justin_o> They will also be providing some alternate designs for UIO+ in a vertical layout. I asked them to present that at a design crit as well, so that may be coming up sometime this month. Although not sure when exactly

2020-02-03T21:10:49  <Caren_> hi gmoss! hope all is well. Can you let me know where the stories we collected last year during storytelling workshops live? I thought they were on the Browse Stories page, but maybe that has changed?
2020-02-03T21:11:21  <michelled> which ones, Caren_?
2020-02-03T21:11:36  <michelled> these ones? https://stories.floeproject.org/storyBrowse.html
2020-02-03T21:11:49  <Caren_> Learning to learn…
2020-02-03T21:12:29  <michelled> yeah, that's where they are
2020-02-03T21:12:40  <michelled> do you see them?
2020-02-03T21:13:00  <Caren_> yes michelled those are them, but they don’t seem to link from Browse stories. I tried on FF and Chrome. I’ll try again
2020-02-03T21:13:37  <michelled> maybe you're looking at the development version of the tool, Caren_?
2020-02-03T21:13:46  <michelled> on that version, the stories are cleared every night
2020-02-03T21:14:09  <colinclark> yeah, I think it’s because of the way we’ve set this “Explore Tool” thing up
2020-02-03T21:14:24  <colinclark> you click on that, and you go to a site that looks totally identical to the one you were just on
2020-02-03T21:14:31  <colinclark> but it’s a different site—it’s the staging site

2020-02-03T21:17:35  <colinclark> It seems like if we’re going to have a little Storytelling Tool “sandbox,” where it’s a separate thing entirely, it should be clear you’re going somewhere else
