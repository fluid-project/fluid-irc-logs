2020-08-06T13:10:56  <michelled> good morning cindyli
2020-08-06T13:13:25  <cindyli> hi michelled
2020-08-06T13:15:16  <michelled> cindyli: I just wanted to let you know that I won't be coming to WeCount checkins anymore unless you want me there and also just let me know if there's anything I can do to help with wecount
2020-08-06T13:15:38  <cindyli> i see. thanks for letting me know, michelled
2020-08-06T15:55:50  <jhung> gmoss I'm looking through the Floe site pr now... I have some concerns about the attention to detail.
2020-08-06T15:56:11  <jhung> If you have time later today I'd like to chat with you about that gmoss
2020-08-06T15:56:51  <gmoss> jhung: that's a bit discouraging. For sure I can make the time to chat with you about that. I have a meeting from 12:30 until maybe 1:30~2:00, then 3:30 until 4:30
2020-08-06T16:00:02  <jhung> How about around 2:15 - 2:30p gmoss ?
2020-08-06T16:00:45  <gmoss> jhung: sure, that works great
2020-08-06T16:02:13  <jhung> I'll put it on the calendar and send you an invite gmoss  :)
2020-08-06T16:02:28  <gmoss> jhung: awesome thanks :) I was just adding it to my own calendar haha
2020-08-06T16:26:23  <gtirloni> jhung: hi! do you know if this is still used? https://github.com/inclusive-design/snow-2016 -- I wonder if we want to archive, deleted it or something else
2020-08-06T16:27:24  <jhung> that's not being used anymore gtirloni - definitely should be archived.
2020-08-06T16:32:25  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: are you available for our daily check-in and jellybean estimation session? :)
2020-08-06T16:33:08  <michelled> yup
2020-08-06T16:33:15  <cindyli> ya
2020-08-06T16:33:38  <cindyli> i will join in 2 mins
2020-08-06T16:34:33  <gtirloni> jhung: thanks
2020-08-06T17:29:53  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: hey folks, is anyone working with this repository (it's empty) -- https://github.com/inclusive-design/look-and-feel
2020-08-06T17:44:53  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I had a similar question on the my spreadsheet of repos i'm using to try to organize our issue tracking. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xKLW8rQC-JN-TI9sL0ojeLXNRoqk4DfPwFd51jAuRJo/edit#
2020-08-06T17:45:09  <Justin_o> gtirloni: would you be able to update that spreadsheet with any updates as you move things around too.
2020-08-06T17:45:36  <gtirloni> Justin_o: yep, will do! I just noticed the repo was crated and 2011 and it doesn't have any commits
2020-08-06T17:46:10  <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, seems unlikely we'd need it.. we're probably the only ones who've looked at it in years.
2020-08-06T17:50:05  <gtirloni> ha! :)
2020-08-06T17:55:55  <gtirloni> I've updated the spreadsheet
2020-08-06T17:56:44  <gtirloni> There were a bunch of really old repos with the installation files for Mediawiki and Wordpress. I think Heidi and Anastasia maybe hoped to do something with that.. but it was just vanilla files (that we can get from the official repos)
2020-08-06T17:57:00  <gtirloni> WP installation files for the IDRC website.. but the IDRC website never used WP
2020-08-06T17:57:16  <gtirloni> MediaWiki installation files for the IDI's Wiki.. but there isn't an IDI wiki :)
2020-08-06T17:57:36  <gtirloni> and so on
2020-08-06T18:23:58  <Justin_o> gtirloni: you must be right about that... I don't have any recollection of plans for that, but I wasn't really involved in that work back then. It's nice to clean things up though.
2020-08-06T19:00:56  <jhung> cherylhjli are you still able to meet re: IDRC website?
2020-08-06T19:01:19  <cherylhjli> yes! give me one second :)
