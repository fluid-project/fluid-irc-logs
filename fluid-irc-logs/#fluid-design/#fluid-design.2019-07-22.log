2019-07-22T17:42:18  <jhung> greatislander I can certainly help with getting the new developer on-ramped if you're away. I feel like we should set up a resource / Wiki page that documents how to contribute.
2019-07-22T17:42:36  <lliskovoi_> Hey jhung, greatislander: I have a client that's building a WP site and on the home page they have video content presented as tabs (there are three different videos each with its own tab, the "tabpanel" content is an embedded YouTube video. They were saying they're looking for a plugin to create those tabs. Any thoughts on this? Have you come across any accessible tab plugins? (disclaimer: I'm not familiar with how
2019-07-22T17:42:37  <lliskovoi_> plugins work in WP, so if this is not the right approach in this case, show me the way haha)
2019-07-22T17:43:11  <greatislander> lliskovoi_ Do you know if they are using the Classic Editor or Gutenberg? The answer would be different depending…
2019-07-22T17:43:37  <lliskovoi_> no, but I'll email them right now and ask
2019-07-22T17:43:41  <greatislander> jhung yeah, a contributing page would be great. I also think setting up issue / PR templates for the github org would be reat
2019-07-22T17:43:43  <greatislander> *great
2019-07-22T17:44:23  <jhung> Awesome. I remember the template you had set up for the a11y issues on Pressbooks was really helpful greatislander. We should use more of those in other projects. :)
2019-07-22T17:45:15  <greatislander> lliskovoi_ I have always created tabbed content using themes when building WordPress sites but I know there are some options available as Gutenberg blocks and also potentially as custom content plugins for the Classic Editor. It would be cool to see which if any implement the tabbed content pattern in an inclusive way (and if there isn't one… maybe a cool project :))
2019-07-22T17:45:37  <greatislander> Yeah jhung I am very fond of the GitHub templates! And you can set them up for an entire org by creating a repo called .github
2019-07-22T17:45:49  <greatislander> e.g.: https://github.com/roots/.github/
2019-07-22T17:45:51  <jhung> lliskovoi_ Often you can create tabbed interfaces that appear visually as tabs, but exist as lists in the markup. The plugin they choose will need to be tested to ensure it's semantically correct and accessible.
2019-07-22T17:47:55  <lliskovoi_> thanks greatislander! I would love to look into that, this is something that will likely come up again. Do you know of any themes that have accessible tab content included (only if you happen to know off the top of your head). Since they haven't started the work yet, they might be open to either Gutenberg or the Classic Editor, but I emailed them to make sure
2019-07-22T17:48:20  <greatislander> Not off the top of my head, I built a custom one for a client project last year
2019-07-22T17:48:32  <greatislander> So it would not be hard to reproduce
2019-07-22T17:49:29  <greatislander> I can reach out to WP a11y/inclusive design folks I know if you would like!
2019-07-22T17:51:31  <lliskovoi_> greatislander, that would be great, though I'm going to poke around a bit first to see if I can get a general sense of the accessibility of what's available
2019-07-22T17:59:52  <lliskovoi_> I haven't found a demo, but this does say that the tabpanel block is ARIA-compliant: https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/components/tab-panel/
2019-07-22T18:07:19  <greatislander> Ah, so that’s the tab panel within the editor UI itself

2019-07-22T18:11:11  <lliskovoi_> oooh
2019-07-22T18:12:44  <lliskovoi_> rookie question: are there different kinds of blocks that depend on which plugin is used or is there a standard set of blocks and the plugin blocks are an addition?
2019-07-22T18:14:08  <lliskovoi_> for example, I found this blocks plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-blocks/ which has a tabbed content block (which is not accessible), but I'm not sure how representative it is of tab blocks in general
