2020-01-16T17:17:02  <jhung> cherylhjli danayo - when you get a chance, take a look at the disclosure component on Pinecone. I wonder if we should try to synchronize the triangle animation with the text appearing. i.e. maybe speed up the animation for the triangle? https://deploy-preview-154--pinecone.netlify.com/components/preview/disclosure-button.html
2020-01-16T17:18:37  <danayo> jhung, not sure - might be good to see what it looks like when it’s faster - I think the animation effect might be lost if it’s too fast?
2020-01-16T17:19:33  <danayo> I don’t mind it the way it is now jhung, what do you think cherylhjli ?
2020-01-16T17:21:58  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.101> has joined #fluid-design
2020-01-16T17:25:23  <greatislander> jhung cherylhjli danayo the animation is set to 0.5s, same as the icon animation for dropdown menus, menu buttons and accordions. If we speed it up here we should probably do the same there as well.
2020-01-16T17:26:42  <jhung> I think 0.3s may be fast enough and still show the animation.

2020-01-16T17:28:16  <jhung> It works well at 0.2s.

2020-01-16T17:29:05  <jhung> For me, it's noticeable that the text appears first before the animation completes. I know I'm nitpicking. :)
