2020-02-18T15:17:13  <cindyli> yes, colinclark
2020-02-18T15:17:44  <colinclark> any chance we have a computer running a recent version of Morphic still kicking around somewhere
2020-02-18T15:18:35  <colinclark> that I can use for this demo tonight?
2020-02-18T15:19:19  <cindyli> colinclark: we do have Windows Surface running a Morphic version that was upgraded probably a year ago. or do you want a more recent version?
2020-02-18T15:19:37  <colinclark> would it be a ton of work to upgrade it?
2020-02-18T15:20:29  <cindyli> colinclark: i need to check with Javi about the new installer etc. haven't upgraded one since the last upgrade on Surface
2020-02-18T15:20:37  <colinclark> ok
2020-02-18T15:20:44  <colinclark> check with Javi and let me know if it seems doable
2020-02-18T15:20:48  <colinclark> if not, i can demo the older version
2020-02-18T15:20:52  <cindyli> ok
2020-02-18T15:27:05  <cindyli> colinclark: Javi is dealing with a family issue right now. Sandra said he should be back online later today. i will check with him at then.
2020-02-18T15:27:15  <colinclark> ok cool

2020-02-18T17:31:57  <greatislander> @cherylhjli are there designs for the UI to add a saved search somewhere? I don't see them
2020-02-18T17:32:53  <cherylhjli> greatislander let me take a look
2020-02-18T17:33:34  *** cindyli <cindyli!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-czcxakbxdjxjtmwc> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-02-18T17:36:21  <cherylhjli> greatislander: they are currently in the wireframes, but I think we haven't revisited it in awhile. currently we're using a modal to get people to enter a name for their search, not sure if that's a pattern we still want to use.
2020-02-18T17:37:06  <greatislander> hmm
