2019-10-31T14:28:43  <jhung> cherylhjli where is the short title for a resource used exactly?
2019-10-31T14:30:31  <cherylhjli> greatislander - i remember you were explaining the utility of a short title?
2019-10-31T14:33:04  <greatislander> jhung cherylhjli The short title is for browse views: so, say you have a resource with the full title "The impact of platform cooperativism on workplace democracy in the digital age: a comparitive analysis of non-traditional governance mechanisms", you might want to provider a shorter title, e.g. "Platform Cooperativism and Workplace Democracy" and show the full title on the resource page.
2019-10-31T14:33:19  <greatislander> The short title is optional; if not provided the full title will be used in all views
2019-10-31T14:36:27  <jhung> greatislander when you say "browse view", do you mean it shows on pages where multiple resources are listed? More specifically, the short title shown to visitors on every page except when viewing the "resource" itself (the "longer" title is used in this case)?
2019-10-31T14:36:44  <greatislander> Yes, that was what we had discussed
2019-10-31T14:37:03  <greatislander> (cherylhjli and I)
2019-10-31T14:37:15  <greatislander> A number of the existing resources had short titles
2019-10-31T14:37:23  <jhung> Ok thanks. That helps me with coming up with labels and help text.

2019-10-31T16:45:24  <danayo_> jhung, michelled, colinclark and everyone: in my meeting with Suara they mentioned that they are planning to start their co-design session by creating personas (since they will be a mixed group of participants including members who will use the platform, managers, HR staff, tech staff).
2019-10-31T16:45:31  <danayo_> I told them we don’t typcially do this, since the point of co-design is to work directly with “users” so there’s no need for personas. But I was looking for good resources to send them about co-design, designing for the edge, something cautionary about personas
2019-10-31T16:45:42  <danayo_> was going to send them this https://handbook.floeproject.org/TheThreeDimensionsPartTwo.html
2019-10-31T16:45:52  <danayo_> and maybe our guide entry on personas
2019-10-31T16:46:03  <danayo_> wondered if you can think of anything else that might be good to send
