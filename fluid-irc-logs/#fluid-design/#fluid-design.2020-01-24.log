2020-01-24T17:02:40  <jhung> greatislander yeah, looks good. May need to add some padding so the Share button doesn't shift.
2020-01-24T17:03:32  <greatislander> jhung it'll be hard to make that work consistently with different localizations, but maybe we can make each button 25% width so it's consistent?
2020-01-24T17:03:39  <greatislander> (of the container)
2020-01-24T17:04:58  <jhung> Or move Share to the beginning to avoid the problem.
2020-01-24T17:05:15  <greatislander> right, if favorite is at the end then it can adjust as needed
2020-01-24T17:05:23  <jhung> yep

2020-01-24T17:09:22  <cherylhjli> greatislander: it looks great! small thing - I do think it's not suuuper obvious when it changes states. Seeing it now, the only thing that changes is the text and I wonder if there's something else that can change (icon, colour, etc) to indicate change. I can explore this later today too
2020-01-24T17:12:49  <cherylhjli> maybe we can just fill in the heart? don't have to make it red
2020-01-24T17:15:13  <greatislander> could do that

2020-01-24T17:33:23  <jhung> greatislander I'm good on my end. Thanks!
2020-01-24T17:33:28  <greatislander> cheers, talk later
2020-01-24T17:33:44  <cherylhjli> nope! safe travels
