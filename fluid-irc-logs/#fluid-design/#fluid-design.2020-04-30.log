2020-04-30T14:41:32  <Justin_o> I think the presentations are more external presentations
2020-04-30T14:41:52  <Justin_o> jhung: but it sounds like the Django stuff was more tutorial/learning.. is that correct?

2020-04-30T14:44:24  <Justin_o> Yah, not sure it fits there because that's kind of specific. I think you should at least put a link to it from the platform co-op space
2020-04-30T14:44:50  <Justin_o>  I wonder if we could use a general spot on the wiki for these kinds of things, and link to the different pages in the wiki and etc that contain other helpful information
2020-04-30T14:47:02  <jhung> Justin_o there's this page that's linked from the Sidebar https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusive+Design+Resources
2020-04-30T14:52:23  <Justin_o> jhung: I'm not sure of the contents and focus of the Django video so not sure if it fits with that page or not
2020-04-30T14:53:05  <jhung> ok. For now I'll link it from the Platform Coop Page.
2020-04-30T14:56:01  <Justin_o> okay, we really do need to do some wiki gardening at some point

2020-04-30T18:05:32  <erictheise> she’s emailed what I needed for now but I was planning to ask her and/or her volunteers to post about any issues w/the survey to GitHub. appears there’s only one volunteer and they are occupied with content creation for the resource library so I’ll be scripting and finessing an import.

2020-04-30T19:34:33  <gmoss> danayo: for the task listed as "Adding video using an URL", does this differ from what we have described further down as "Embed Youtube and other videos" (SJRK-311) or "Automatically turn YouTube URLS into embedded videos"? (for reference: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-311)
2020-04-30T19:36:07  <danayo> gmoss: I’m guessing there are steps to this 1. being able to add a direct/active link, and 2. embedding the video (such that you can see/play it within the story frame). Does that sound right / make sense?
2020-04-30T19:38:01  <gmoss> danayo: it does sound right. To clarify, which block type(s) do you imagine this being added to? I can see a case for both text and video blocks, or for simplicity's sake we can restrict it to one or the other (i'm leaning towards video only)
2020-04-30T19:43:10  <danayo> gmoss: I’m thinking video blocks.
2020-04-30T19:43:42  <danayo> we can’t / don’t want to stop authors from adding URLs to text blocks, but we can prompt for video links/files from video blocks only
2020-04-30T19:44:46  <gmoss> danayo: okay. so this sounds a lot like what we had for SJRK-311.  I'm not sure what you mean exactly when you say "prompt for video links". does that mean if a user pastes in a video link in a text block, we would suggest that they use a video block instead?

2020-04-30T19:45:18  <danayo> gmoss no I just mean that a video block will be the obvious place to add a video
2020-04-30T19:45:18  <gmoss> this is all very helpful :) just trying to get a clearer idea so I can better estimate it
2020-04-30T19:45:41  <gmoss> danayo: ah okay, yeah I agree in that case
2020-04-30T19:45:51  <gmoss> thank you!
2020-04-30T19:48:34  <gmoss> danayo: if it's alright, I'll remove the row that had SJRK-311 mentioned
2020-04-30T19:48:47  <gmoss> (row 21)
2020-04-30T19:49:48  <danayo> gmoss we need to define the two steps / two issues, no?
2020-04-30T19:49:59  <danayo> separate those out
2020-04-30T19:50:10  <danayo> you’ve grouped them on line 6
2020-04-30T19:52:13  <gmoss> danayo: hmm.. I think I may not understand the distinction, then. As I understand it, the first step is to allow the embedding via a URL but no preview, and the second step is to show an embedded preview of the video within the editor. Is that right?
2020-04-30T19:54:20  <gmoss> danayo: do you have some time this afternoon to have a quick call about this?
2020-04-30T19:54:41  <danayo> I’m in a meeting now gmoss and have another one in 5
2020-04-30T19:55:21  <gmoss> danayo: oops, okay. sorry to disturb you! I'll try to figure this out, we can reconnect on Monday then

2020-04-30T19:55:57  <danayo> if you think that those two steps are part of the same chunk of work that’s fine, I’m just thinking that if the first step can be put into place quickly (a URL) we should separate them out
