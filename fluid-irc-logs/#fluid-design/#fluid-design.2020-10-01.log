2020-10-01T12:18:32  <michelled> omg, this hacktoberfest spam is hilarious
2020-10-01T12:18:47  <michelled> I wonder how we got on people's radar - I don't remember this from other years Justin_o
2020-10-01T12:20:15  <Justin_o> michelled: I don't recall from past years either. Perhaps related to our involvement in GSoC this year. I wonder if the pandemic is also elevating contributions to open source communities as well.
2020-10-01T12:20:28  <michelled> oh that's possible
2020-10-01T12:27:10  <Justin_o> gtirloni: if I use that site, will it use my image for anything else?
2020-10-01T12:27:48  <gtirloni> it says it won't but who knows
2020-10-01T12:30:47  <sbates> Justin_o, michelled: are other repos getting spam also?
2020-10-01T12:31:04  <Justin_o> sbates: there were at least two of our that I noticed spam for
2020-10-01T12:31:57  <michelled> greatislander found some too https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/201
2020-10-01T12:32:13  <greatislander> I did indeed
2020-10-01T12:32:13  <Justin_o> I guess that's actually at least 3 repos then
2020-10-01T12:32:41  <Justin_o> sbates and greatislander: thanks for taking care of them so far
2020-10-01T12:32:52  <greatislander> this is the best one
2020-10-01T12:32:53  <greatislander> https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/65/files
2020-10-01T12:33:07  <sbates> wow
2020-10-01T12:33:17  <michelled> truly Amazing!
2020-10-01T12:33:18  <greatislander> This one is right on the line but I think it should be closed too‚Ä¶ thoughts? https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/64
2020-10-01T12:33:41  <greatislander> also haha https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/63/files
2020-10-01T12:33:49  <greatislander> "Fluid web as an Amazing Project"
2020-10-01T12:34:14  <Justin_o> I mean I like how it makes me think of Spider-man
2020-10-01T12:34:29  <greatislander> hahah
2020-10-01T12:34:43  <sbates> DigitalOcean really needs to change the program
2020-10-01T12:34:54  <greatislander> yeah‚Ä¶
2020-10-01T12:35:01  <Justin_o> PR #64 is at least a valid change.. for the missing "the".
2020-10-01T12:35:01  <michelled> yeah, at this point it's just make work for open source projects
2020-10-01T12:35:27  <sbates> yeah, it's putting all of the work on project maintainers
2020-10-01T12:35:41  <Justin_o> michelled, sbates: I thought I read somewhere that they'd get blocked from receiving any incentive if they made to many spam PRs but I can't find that now, so I might be mistaken
2020-10-01T12:36:20  <sbates> the way the program is set up, it's encouraging bad behaviour
2020-10-01T12:37:15  <sbates> by making any repo eligible, rather than opt in
2020-10-01T12:37:56  <greatislander> this dovetails in an interesting way with our design crit conversation from Tuesday
2020-10-01T12:38:01  <sbates> it's very possible that lots of project maintainers don't know about Hacktoberfest and haven't taken the time to read about their rules for marking spam PRs
2020-10-01T12:38:44  <Justin_o> greatislander: yes, it's amazing how quickly things came up. I guess just timing.
2020-10-01T12:38:45  <sbates> I was looking at the person who made the cities PR and 3 other PRs against other repos have been closed, but not labelled as 'invalid' or 'spam'
2020-10-01T12:38:49  <Justin_o> sbates: that's a very good point
2020-10-01T12:39:08  <greatislander> they should add wontfix to the list
2020-10-01T12:39:16  <greatislander> or just disqualify if the PR is closed
2020-10-01T12:39:37  <greatislander> also I think a three-strike rule would help‚Äî three PRs get marked as spam, you're out
2020-10-01T12:40:04  <sbates> yeah, they need to do something
2020-10-01T12:40:13  <Justin_o> sbates, greatislander: this has some more info that they sent out https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details
2020-10-01T12:41:23  <greatislander> oh I know all the rules, I get a t-shirt every year ;)
2020-10-01T12:41:51  <greatislander> it's easy if you actually work on open source projects as your day job haha
2020-10-01T12:42:53  <Justin_o> greatislander: it's very true.. this year you can get trees planted in lieu of the t-shirt but I'm not sure if you'll still get the stickers.. I'd guess not.
2020-10-01T12:43:02  <greatislander> I guess not
2020-10-01T12:43:07  <Justin_o> greatislander: also this part was in the Participation rules "If a maintainer reports behavior that‚Äôs not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate"
2020-10-01T12:43:12  <greatislander> aha
2020-10-01T12:43:16  <greatislander> how does one do that?
2020-10-01T12:43:30  <greatislander> I really don't want to spend my time reporting these people
2020-10-01T12:43:35  <Justin_o> I was just going to say I'm not sure how one actually does that
2020-10-01T12:43:55  <Justin_o> yep.. although we might be able to create a GitHub action to do that
2020-10-01T12:44:13  <Justin_o> although that's also not the best use of time
2020-10-01T12:44:45  <sbates> it's a real problem that the program isn't opt-in, all of the rules are reasonable if you want to participant as a project maintainer, but pushing all of this work on every GitHub repo is problematic
2020-10-01T12:47:35  <greatislander> There used to be a thing which I don't see encouraged this year where you could add a `hacktoberfest` label to issues to encourage participants to work on those
2020-10-01T12:47:40  <greatislander> kind of like `good-first-issue`
2020-10-01T12:48:11  <greatislander> And if that were the process‚Äî maintainers could opt in by labelling issues that they'd accept PRs for‚Äî that could be cool
2020-10-01T12:48:15  <gtirloni> michelled: re: hacktoberfest spam, people are already getting mad :) https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/
2020-10-01T12:54:16  <michelled> ha 'a corporate-sponsored distributed denial of service attack'
2020-10-01T12:57:36  <sbates> and this is just the first day of the month (though today is maybe likely to be the worst)
2020-10-01T12:59:34  <michelled> and it really doesn't do anyone any good. I'm going to guess that the folks trying to get the t-shirts don't realize the repercussions to being seen as a spammer in the OS communities they are making pulls to. it's unlikely they realize the effect they are having
2020-10-01T12:59:58  <michelled> both on other people and on their future work
2020-10-01T13:01:26  <Justin_o> they do still recommend adding the `Hacktoberfest` label, although maybe that recommendation isn't as prominent as before.. but those are just for starters, then your primary contributors would not get credit for all their work. It's sort of a question of convenience and etc, but there are so many levels and etc to consider.
2020-10-01T13:01:44  <Justin_o> I guess there is a question of what is the program really trying to encourage and are they achieving that
2020-10-01T13:01:50  <Justin_o> and at what cost
2020-10-01T13:46:44  <sbates> a query to find Hacktoberfest closed spam PRs: https://github.com/search?p=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aspam+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-30&type=Issues (from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24650196)
2020-10-01T13:47:19  <sbates> 867 so far
2020-10-01T13:47:53  <sbates> PRs closed with label 'spam' created after Sept 30
2020-10-01T13:54:47  <sbates> wow, some people are actively breaking projects
2020-10-01T13:54:49  <sbates> https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/website/pull/102/files
2020-10-01T13:55:21  <danielcho> wow.. :o
2020-10-01T13:56:44  <danielcho> did they really name PR "Just ignore"
2020-10-01T13:56:50  <sbates> yep
2020-10-01T14:04:41  <gtirloni> https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/pull/2866
2020-10-01T14:06:25  <danielcho> lol
2020-10-01T14:06:31  <Justin_o> üôÅ
2020-10-01T14:14:44  <sbates> https://github.com/Gadgetoid/Pinout.xyz/pull/383/files
2020-10-01T14:15:35  <danielcho> spammers are creative
2020-10-01T14:17:02  <sbates> could be a bot
2020-10-01T14:18:13  <Justin_o> "amazing project" seems to be very popular, does seem like a bot
2020-10-01T14:18:19  <gtirloni> hacktoberfest should be "Make a PR to a DigitalOcean-owned repository and win a t-shirt"... :-)
2020-10-01T14:18:36  <danielcho> haha good idea
2020-10-01T14:18:51  <sbates> yeah, the non-opt-in is really a problem
2020-10-01T14:19:37  <Justin_o> gtirloni: maybe this repo https://github.com/digitalocean/hacktoberfest
2020-10-01T14:20:08  <gtirloni> lol
2020-10-01T14:20:45  <gtirloni> incentives are really hard.. https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_our_loss_of_wisdom/transcript?language=en
2020-10-01T14:20:47  <Justin_o> sbates: here are the PRs closed as invalid https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Ainvalid+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-30
2020-10-01T14:21:36  <sbates> that's an even bigger number
2020-10-01T14:22:01  <greatislander> lol https://github.com/digitalocean/hacktoberfest/commit/7e506132843dff1a70c2a532cb8bbf7aceaabc30
2020-10-01T14:24:27  <sbates> ha
2020-10-01T14:24:34  <greatislander> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/pCcEQRFZ/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-01%20at%2011.24.21%20AM.png
2020-10-01T14:24:44  <greatislander> I'm tempted
2020-10-01T14:24:58  <sbates> lol
2020-10-01T14:25:04  <danielcho> :)
2020-10-01T14:25:22  <Justin_o> so they are making a shortcut by allowing PRs to your own repos now. So those that just want a T-Shirt can stop spamming others... they are still effectively steeling t-shirts from people who want to contribute but I guess that's less impact
2020-10-01T14:25:42  <greatislander> if they want to give away a bunch of t-shirts I guess that's on them
2020-10-01T14:26:04  <greatislander> I can imagine that no one will want to sponsor Hacktoberfest after this debacle
2020-10-01T14:26:08  <Justin_o> but only the first 70k get t-shirts so some people will get locked out.. but oh well.
2020-10-01T14:26:14  <greatislander> yeah
2020-10-01T14:26:32  <Justin_o> on the other hand, maybe a lot of trees will get planted
2020-10-01T14:27:09  <greatislander> Justin_o: I think I've addressed all of your review comments‚Äî still running into an ESLint issue with the async keyword which is puzzling me (on the CSS processing branch)
2020-10-01T14:38:21  <Justin_o> greatislander: yes, async won't work with fluid-grunt-lint-all until https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/pull/15 is merged and a new package published. After that happens and you updated to it, you may need to configure the parser to a newer version. e.g. https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/pull/15/files#diff-df39304d828831c44a2b9f38cd45289cR4
2020-10-01T14:43:07  <greatislander> ah, thanks, it was the parser version‚Äî  I'd set it to 7 but I think it needed to be 8
2020-10-01T15:03:27  <Justin_o> greatislander: just going to take a look at this https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/30#discussion_r498250149 what's the process for reproducing?
2020-10-01T15:19:46  <greatislander> added a comment, Justin_o
2020-10-01T15:22:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks.. are the local build instructions updated in another PR? https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/blob/master/README.md#to-build-locally
2020-10-01T15:22:51  <Justin_o> It suggests to use `npm run start` and doesn't mention `npm run build` as you did the in the comment. Also not sure what `fluid-website` directory is referring to.
2020-10-01T15:23:20  <greatislander> Justin_o yes, they are updated in a earlier PR (you reviewed them from newest to oldest :))
2020-10-01T15:23:46  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks
2020-10-01T15:24:01  <Justin_o> I'm off to another meeting but I'll try to take a look at this between meetings today
2020-10-01T15:24:20  <greatislander> That file you linked does include a reference to npm run build, though‚Äî start is dev mode with live reloading, build is build files for deployment

2020-10-01T16:26:31  <cindyli> Teddy___: i think i sent your another invite to https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres. let me know if you don't receive. thanks
2020-10-01T16:26:59  <cindyli> i used your github account "TeddTech" for this invite
2020-10-01T16:33:13  <Teddy___> cindyli: got it, thanks
2020-10-01T16:35:34  <cindyli> great
2020-10-01T16:35:42  <greatislander> cindyli Teddy___ I have a question about UIO on the We Count site. Is the reason the script is both preloaded and loaded with script tag to support browsers which can't handle `<link rel="preload">`?
2020-10-01T16:36:02  <greatislander> I'm looking at https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/src/_includes/layouts/base.njk#L12 and https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/src/_includes/layouts/base.njk#L21
2020-10-01T16:37:21  <cindyli> greatislander: yes
2020-10-01T16:37:26  <greatislander> great, thanks

2020-10-01T17:04:52  <michelled> danielcho, sbates: were we going to meet now?
2020-10-01T17:05:16  <danielcho> michelled: I think so
2020-10-01T17:06:07  <sbates> danielcho, michelled: I'll start a skype call
2020-10-01T17:06:19  <danielcho> sounds good :)
