2020-05-27T13:59:56  <greatislander> gtirloni thanks for taking care of the migration! Only issue I've noticed is that it appears that dev.directory.platform.coop is being served with the SSL cert for demo.directory.platform.coop. Not urgent but something to look at when you have a chance
2020-05-27T14:00:14  <greatislander> cherylhjli jhung did y'all want to touch base about the Pinecone stuff?
2020-05-27T14:00:27  <gtirloni> greatislander: oh, that's true. i'll fix it

2020-05-27T16:12:22  <cherylhjli> greatislander did we do a 404 for the tool library at some point? what's the copy there?
2020-05-27T16:12:33  <greatislander> I don't think we did
2020-05-27T16:12:38  <greatislander> But resource library has one

2020-05-27T16:14:18  <cherylhjli> no worries - is there any reason why we can't recycle this for the directory and tool lib both?
2020-05-27T16:14:43  <danayo> thanks for the Nextcloud link gtirloni, I think it’s more about how I synced the folders but I’ll get back to you in a bit!

2020-05-27T16:57:55  <cherylhjli> greatislander erictheise - any idea if changing colour of the map itself is something that's relatively easy? danayo and I were just looking at the contrast and realized both the light and dark version aren't super great for contrast

2020-05-27T17:11:41  <danayo> just to clarify cherylhjli’s comment above greatislander, erictheise (sorry if this is obvious) but we were looking at the “Light”, “Dark” and “Streets” options in Mapbox, none of which have great type/background contrast and wondered if the colours are customizable to any degree
2020-05-27T17:13:41  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2020-05-27T17:16:19  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo I believe so: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-a-custom-style/#adjust-the-color-palette
2020-05-27T17:16:19  <greatislander> erictheise, I think there was an issue (or at any rate, a line in iteration planning) about refining the map colour scheme. Was that the case?
2020-05-27T17:37:06  <erictheise> danayo greatislander the cartography is the reason I was asked to work on this project and if I don’t get to work on that and the accessibility issues I am going to be crestfallen.

2020-05-27T18:19:52  <greatislander> hi erictheise, I had one more question I meant to ask which was: is this okay with you? https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/issues/68
2020-05-27T18:20:20  <greatislander> TL:DR; create a dev branch which is deployed to dev.directory.platform.coop; make it the default branch; keep master as the "production" / "stable" branch
2020-05-27T18:21:23  <greatislander> no urgency in responding, i am taking the dog for a walk at the moment.
