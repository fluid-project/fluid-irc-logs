2019-12-16T16:08:53  <cherylhjli> jhung greatislander michelled dont know if you folks have seen this on modo's website:
2019-12-16T16:08:55  <cherylhjli> "We also make our proprietary booking software available to others, in order to grow the carshare movement. Over a dozen carshare operators around the world use our system. Some are paying customers, while others such as non-profits and Canadian co-ops access it without licensing fees."
2019-12-16T16:09:50  <cherylhjli> it seems their API is also open: https://bookit.modo.coop/api/v2

2019-12-16T18:03:10  <cherylhjli> greatislander jhung danayo - hey you all, as I quickly mentioned in standup there are a few loose ends around filtering that Ned and I thought we should check in together about as a team when we talked last thu/fri. I also know today is packed, did we want to squeeze that in today or do it tomorrow?
2019-12-16T18:03:56  <greatislander> I don't think it's feasible to fit that in today for me. Can we do tomorrow?
2019-12-16T18:04:33  <jhung> Tomorrow morning ET before standup works for me cherylhjli
2019-12-16T18:10:43  <danayo> cherylhjli, greatislander, jhung would meeting after planning tomorrow work? or perhaps right after index planning?
2019-12-16T18:11:21  <jhung> yeah that works danayo
