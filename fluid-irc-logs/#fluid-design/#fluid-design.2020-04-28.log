2020-04-28T19:01:54  <simonjb> danayo: if we split the location search from the filter, it might make sense to have the filter UI between the map and the results: map (with search, zoom), filters, results
2020-04-28T19:03:02  <simonjb> the map provides the data set for the selected region, the filters filter the set and the results are the output of the filtering
2020-04-28T19:09:11  <danayo> thanks simonjb, I think that would be a good flow
2020-04-28T19:15:34  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: There's an issue with some PHP websites, I'm working on a fix
2020-04-28T19:19:26  <danielcho> danayo: for the case where users forget to save filter options, maybe having a modal to ask confirmation from users when the filtering options are selected but not saved. Constantly updating map might cause sync problem with the map
2020-04-28T19:21:49  <danayo> thanks danielcho
2020-04-28T19:22:17  <danayo> I was also thinking about how to let the user know they haven’t yet applied their filters
2020-04-28T19:23:30  <simonjb> danayo: thinking some more, if the location seach is part of the map, then I think the map and filters could be in either order, as long as they are both before the results
2020-04-28T19:24:38  <simonjb> the map and filters are both inputs into the results and maybe there isn't a clear order
2020-04-28T19:24:55  <simonjb> so I think either could work
2020-04-28T19:25:14  <danayo> yes! I was thinking, simonjb, that zoom and location are essentially filtering the results
2020-04-28T19:25:27  <danayo> so like you say, similar inputs
2020-04-28T19:25:29  <simonjb> yeah, exactly
2020-04-28T19:27:05  <danielcho> yeah, using a modal can help let the user know that the filter is not applied, as well as providing options to either save or clear the filter, just an idea :)
2020-04-28T19:38:09  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: Issue with PHP websites is fixed

2020-04-28T19:51:29  <gtirloni> :)
2020-04-28T19:52:53  <gtirloni> I have a basic question about our story telling website and text-to-speech: Is it possible to introduce a pause/comma somewhere without actually adding a comma in the text? For example, in this page it reads very quick as "by Nate Keywords" without a pause (reads like Nate's lastname is "Keywords") -- https://aihec.inclusivedesign.ca/storyView.html?id=62a05120-8989-11ea-bd2f-dfa1b38c1b47
2020-04-28T19:59:54  <gmoss> gtirloni: this is a little trickier to control, now that we're using the Orator component for TTS. Let me poke around a little more
2020-04-28T20:00:21  <gmoss> Justin_o may be able to provide further insight :)
2020-04-28T20:00:47  <gtirloni> no rush, i really know close to zero about this but I was using the tts and felt hard to follow... but people with screen readers probably are used to it, I don't know
2020-04-28T20:00:48  <gtirloni> thanks :)
2020-04-28T20:06:14  <Justin_o> gtirloni, gmoss: it probably also has to do with the specific synthesizer user. Which may vary depending on language and platform
2020-04-28T20:06:53  <Justin_o> I just tried in Safari on macOS and it did pause between Nate and Keywords. It's sort of how the synthesizer is interpreting/deciding what to do with the whitespace
2020-04-28T20:07:08  <gtirloni> makes sense (linux/chrome here)
2020-04-28T20:07:47  <Justin_o> It could also depend on how the particular browser is feeding that text into the Orator. That is, are we getting a new line versus a single space.. but I think that's more standard at this point.
2020-04-28T20:07:50  <gmoss> gtirloni, Justin_o: I've also just tried it, and it pauses for me as well (Win10/Chrome81)
2020-04-28T20:08:09  <gtirloni> in firefox it paused just fine (except the voice is old school robotic)
2020-04-28T20:08:30  <gtirloni> interesting
2020-04-28T20:08:32  <gtirloni> thanks folks
2020-04-28T20:08:36  <gmoss> :)
2020-04-28T20:09:13  <gmoss> We used to have much more fine-grained control over the flow of that content, but it also came with some bugs, so this setup is much better. That said, gtirloni you've highlighted an issue
