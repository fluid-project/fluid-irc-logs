2019-11-26T15:13:27  <michelled> cool
2019-11-26T15:13:53  <michelled> it's kind of interesting how they are framing it as something they did for one family - this is very much like what we talk about - solve for the edge etc.

2019-11-26T20:43:00  <sepidehshahi> great! thanks danayo_ is this in the BiT folder as well?
2019-11-26T20:43:43  <danayo_> not yet sepidehshahi ! :) I’ll put it there
2019-11-26T20:44:05  <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks danayo_
2019-11-26T20:45:17  <sepidehshahi> danielcho: how difficult it is to add a vertical scroll to the program view on the current prototype?
2019-11-26T20:46:38  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: I haven't used a scroll component yet, let me check if React Bootstrap have scroll component
2019-11-26T20:47:18  <sepidehshahi> sure, because if that’s difficult I can come up with an alternative
2019-11-26T20:50:36  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: unfortunately, they don't have any scroll properties for the container we are using for the block editor, but I can take some time to see if I can just apply that if you like to
2019-11-26T20:51:12  <sepidehshahi> no worries danielcho
2019-11-26T20:51:19  <danielcho> most likely it will be just a css overflow property

2019-11-26T20:58:05  <greatislander> sure!
2019-11-26T20:58:15  <michelled> thx!
2019-11-26T20:58:31  <sepidehshahi> michelled: I have to pick up Sepehr at that time
2019-11-26T20:58:34  <sepidehshahi> sorry
2019-11-26T20:58:41  <michelled> no worries!
2019-11-26T20:58:52  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: I can add scroll bar easily, just need to set fixed height for the program block editor
2019-11-26T20:59:06  <danielcho> ^I just tried and is simple fix
2019-11-26T20:59:07  <sepidehshahi> perfect danielcho
2019-11-26T20:59:17  <sepidehshahi> so I add that to the wireframes
2019-11-26T20:59:24  <danielcho> sounds good :)
2019-11-26T20:59:53  <greatislander> jhung meant to pass this on to you (I showed it to Cheryl a while back): https://when.works/
2019-11-26T20:59:53  <greatislander> It's iOS only but I like the simplicity (I've used it for freelance appointments in the past)
2019-11-26T21:01:57  <jhung> thanks greatislander! I'll add it to the list.
