2018-11-08T17:40:32  <colinclark> danayo, michelled: Someone pointed me to this tool on Twitter: https://pol.is/home
2018-11-08T17:42:49  <colinclark> "There's an open-source version of Polis if you have a team technical enough to set up your own deploy. Some features are not included in the open source version, including the report and Monitor view."
2018-11-08T17:42:57  <colinclark> I always find that proviso interesting
2018-11-08T17:43:01  <colinclark> it's the mark of a business model
2018-11-08T17:44:00  <michelled> yeah, and it usually means that the things you most want aren't available for open source
