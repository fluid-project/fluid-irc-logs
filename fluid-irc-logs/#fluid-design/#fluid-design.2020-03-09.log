2020-03-09T14:39:20  <greatislander> hey Justin_o, is there an IDRC Netlify team we can move the We Count site into?
2020-03-09T14:40:27  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-design
2020-03-09T14:40:40  <Justin_o> greatislander: not that I'm aware of. I think avtar was looking into that, but last I recall it wasn't created.
2020-03-09T14:40:54  <greatislander> Okay, thanks.
2020-03-09T14:41:19  <greatislander> I was able to get an Open Source account for Platform Co-op. I could pursue that avenue for We Count too…
2020-03-09T14:41:22  <Justin_o> greatislander: maybe colinclark would know too.
2020-03-09T14:41:50  <Justin_o> greatislander: is that only good for a single site/github repo?
2020-03-09T14:42:12  <greatislander> No it's good for many sites.
2020-03-09T14:42:30  <Justin_o> greatislander: can you apply for one for the idrc?
2020-03-09T14:42:44  <Justin_o> or the fluid-project GitHub org maybe
2020-03-09T14:43:02  <Justin_o> and inclusive-design GitHub org, depending on how it works on their end
2020-03-09T14:43:02  <greatislander> I could, yes.
2020-03-09T14:43:15  <greatislander> I don't think it's limited to a single GitHub org
2020-03-09T14:43:42  <Justin_o> ah okay.. if that's the case, then an idrc or fluid one would probably be the way to go.. maybe check with colinclark about that
2020-03-09T14:43:59  *** michelled <michelled!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-qobcdrtyoqxdtinv> has joined #fluid-design
2020-03-09T14:44:23  <greatislander> There's a couple prerequisites: if we are hosting anything on Netlify now (I think there's a couple sites— SJRK and maybe another? as well as the We Count dev site) we would need to add some sort of "hosted on Netlify" badge to the README and maybe something discreet in the site footer along the lines of this
2020-03-09T14:44:55  <greatislander> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xG1n2Sgo/IDRC%20site%20credits
2020-03-09T14:45:01  <greatislander> (from the IDRC site)

2020-03-09T14:46:14  <Justin_o> colinclark: greatislander and I are just talking about netlify and could use your input. If you look back at the last few minutes of the logs you should be able to catch up on the conversation
2020-03-09T14:46:39  <Justin_o> in short we're talking about applying for an open-source netlify account
2020-03-09T14:48:28  <colinclark> I have read the logs
2020-03-09T14:48:33  <colinclark> what can I help with?
2020-03-09T14:50:57  <greatislander> So, colinclark, the question is:
2020-03-09T14:50:57  <greatislander> 1. Which projects are using Netlify now that would be moved into this team account? (I believe SJRK + We Count but not sure what else.
2020-03-09T14:50:57  <greatislander> 2. Is it okay to add credits to these sites/project readmes indicating that they are hosted with Netlify?
2020-03-09T14:51:49  <avtar> greatislander: c2lc uses netlify as well
2020-03-09T14:51:58  <colinclark> 2. Yes, for sure
2020-03-09T14:52:00  <greatislander> Right on
2020-03-09T14:52:04  <greatislander> thanks avtar
2020-03-09T14:52:07  <colinclark> eco-op.inclusivedesign.ca now too
2020-03-09T14:52:09  <greatislander> and colinclark!
2020-03-09T14:52:13  <colinclark> also uses Netlify
2020-03-09T14:52:48  <greatislander> Okay, so first steps would be: 1. I open PRs on these projects to add the readme badge and credit; 2. Once merged I can apply for a Netlify Open Source account for the IDRC.
2020-03-09T14:52:59  <colinclark> I think that seems reasonable
2020-03-09T14:53:03  <greatislander> Awesome.
2020-03-09T14:53:11  <colinclark> the only question is what to do about the one-org-per issue
2020-03-09T14:53:17  <greatislander> ?
2020-03-09T14:53:31  <colinclark> I thought Justin_o was saying that all the repos had to be in same org?
2020-03-09T14:53:35  <colinclark> or was I confused
2020-03-09T14:53:44  <greatislander> Nope they don't
2020-03-09T14:53:44  <Justin_o> colinclark: that was more of a question on my part
2020-03-09T14:53:47  <colinclark> ah ok
2020-03-09T14:53:48  <colinclark> great
2020-03-09T14:54:00  <colinclark> yes, definitely go for it
2020-03-09T14:54:07  <greatislander> Yeah, you can pick any GitHub repo, personal or in an org to add to a Netlify account
2020-03-09T14:54:09  <greatislander> great!
2020-03-09T14:54:10  <greatislander> will do
2020-03-09T14:54:19  <Justin_o> eco-op.inclusivedesign.ca  this sounds like an interesting project
2020-03-09T14:54:34  <colinclark> https://eco-op.inclusivedesign.ca/
2020-03-09T14:54:50  <colinclark> I’m excited about it too, Justin_o
2020-03-09T14:55:01  <Justin_o> greatislander: what, if any, restrictions are there for open source netlify accounts?
2020-03-09T14:55:13  <greatislander> Hang on, let me double check

2020-03-09T15:21:20  <greatislander> if you hit the usage limits they’ll bill you automatically
2020-03-09T15:22:21  <Justin_o> greatislander: can we get a notification before hand or otherwise prevent that from happening. I doubt that would be an issue, but if we run into a bug or some DoS or something that triggers them we might have an issue
2020-03-09T15:26:05  <greatislander> Yes, I believe so

2020-03-09T16:07:04  <michelled> Justin_o, jhung - do you know what we need to do to let people other than the zoom account owner to record?
2020-03-09T16:07:22  <michelled> Bert and I need to do that for the C2LC and WeCount rooms
2020-03-09T16:10:14  <Justin_o> michelled: the host can record, or the host can give access to someone to record
2020-03-09T16:10:39  <michelled> how do you give access to someone?
2020-03-09T16:11:14  <Justin_o> michelled: you can join the meeting and someone can request access I believe. Also I believe if the host joins and leaves, someone else is bumped up to being the host
2020-03-09T16:11:23  <Justin_o> so you could try that too
2020-03-09T16:14:31  <michelled> cindyli: unfortunately it looks like you'd need to co-ordinate with Bert in order to record in the meeting room :(

2020-03-09T19:14:27  <greatislander> what Teddy___ said, michelled
2020-03-09T19:15:30  <colinclark> oh sorry, just catching up michelled and greatislander
2020-03-09T19:15:42  <colinclark> yes, the Nexus has a long history
2020-03-09T19:15:52  <colinclark> and is very closely aligned with other aspects of Fluid’s goals
2020-03-09T19:16:31  <colinclark> “inventing design practices and technologies that support inclusion”
2020-03-09T19:16:46  <colinclark> and given its proximity to Infusion, I think it makes thee most sense there
2020-03-09T19:17:26  <colinclark> I need to spend some time reworking the Fluid site so that this is all clearer
2020-03-09T19:18:11  <colinclark> but I think in general, Fluid is where our open source work happens, especially if it doesn’t have to be closely “branded” for a particular project
2020-03-09T19:25:15  <greatislander> okay, makes sense! Thanks for clarifying, colinclark
2020-03-09T19:31:25  <cindyli> colinclark, Teddy___, weCount meeting is starting

2020-03-09T21:14:39  <erictheise> cherylhjli danayo do you know if you can create dropdowns in Google forms like Trebor & Angela are using? I'd like to give them a list of countries rather than have people key them in.
2020-03-09T21:15:09  <cherylhjli> yeah i'm pretty sure you can create dropdowns in google forms erictheise
2020-03-09T21:15:15  <cherylhjli> if not dropdown, then maybe radio buttons might be good too
2020-03-09T21:15:39  <erictheise> there are a lot of countries for radio buttons!
2020-03-09T21:16:32  <cherylhjli> ahhhh true
2020-03-09T21:17:00  <cherylhjli> yeah there's a drop down option

2020-03-09T21:20:41  <erictheise> huh. when I click on the "request edit access" it just goes to the busted robot page.
2020-03-09T21:25:08  <cherylhjli> for Trebor
2020-03-09T21:25:10  <cherylhjli> 's survey?
2020-03-09T21:25:15  <cherylhjli> or the google doc?

2020-03-09T21:38:41  <erictheise> for Trebor's survey.
2020-03-09T21:39:14  <erictheise> I didn't think I could edit it but I'm surprised that the link for requesting edit capability is broken.
