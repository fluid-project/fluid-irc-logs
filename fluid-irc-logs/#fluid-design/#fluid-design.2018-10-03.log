2018-10-03T17:57:42  <Justin_o> okay sure
2018-10-03T18:03:11  <jhung> fluid-everyone: never mind. I just used the Display settings and scaled one of my displays to 1920x1080.

2018-10-03T18:08:26  <avtar> ah nm
2018-10-03T18:10:15  <avtar> for future reference in case anyone's searching the logs, you can either use obs and set the resolution in settings -> video
2018-10-03T18:10:53  <avtar> or change the display resolution like you did
2018-10-03T18:11:12  <avtar> or if using quicktime player you can drag and select the recording area and set it to 1920x1080
2018-10-03T18:11:58  <jhung> avtar: that's super helpful. Perhaps dropping that somewhere in the wiki? Not sure where it should go however.
