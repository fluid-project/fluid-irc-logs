2020-07-22T15:23:09  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-07-22T15:50:27  <cindyli> Uttara: i found font sizes for texts on 3 cards on the home page are not same on the Figma. the first column of mockup uses 18px while the 2nd column uses 24 px
2020-07-22T15:50:44  <cindyli> could you sync up them? thanks
2020-07-22T15:51:09  <cindyli> and let Teddy___ and I know which size you prefer. thanks
2020-07-22T15:51:17  <Uttara> cindyli:yes will sync them up
2020-07-22T15:52:12  <cindyli> thanks
2020-07-22T16:31:58  <gmoss> cindyli michelled Justin_o: would you like to do a Storytelling check-in? I see Dana isn't online at the moment. I also don't plan to do much ST work today, mainly GSoC
2020-07-22T16:33:36  <michelled> gmoss: dana has today off. let's just meet tomorrow
2020-07-22T16:34:57  <gmoss> michelled: right, I see her email now :) I'm planning to take tomorrow and Friday off, so I won't be able to do a check-in tomorrow. Feel free to meet without me, of course, and I'll prepare for the jellybean estimate session on Monday
2020-07-22T16:36:11  <michelled> cool, monday it is :)
2020-07-22T17:34:41  <michelled> alanharnum: do you have a couple minutes to talk?
2020-07-22T17:35:22  <alanharnum> michelled: sure, if you don't mind me eating my lunch while it's happening - or I can chat in like 20 :)
2020-07-22T17:35:33  <michelled> I don't mind at all, if you dont :)
2020-07-22T17:35:41  <michelled> what ever you'd prefer
2020-07-22T17:36:21  <alanharnum> let's chat now, which Zoom room?
2020-07-22T17:36:34  <michelled> let's try standup
2020-07-22T19:50:38  <michelled> Teddy___: did you see the request from Vera?
2020-07-22T19:53:39  <michelled> Justin_o: did you see the request from Vera?
2020-07-22T19:54:16  <Justin_o> michelled: about the footer?
2020-07-22T19:54:35  <michelled> yeah, is it something you can do?
2020-07-22T19:54:47  <michelled> or do we need to wait for cindy?
2020-07-22T19:55:43  <Teddy___> michelled: no checking it out now
2020-07-22T19:56:57  <Teddy___> Finished reading
2020-07-22T19:57:00  <Teddy___> I can do it
2020-07-22T19:57:33  <michelled> oh great - will you be able to deploy it too?
2020-07-22T19:57:47  <Teddy___> I’ll have to learn how to do that
2020-07-22T19:58:08  <michelled> Teddy___: I wonder if you'd have the correct perms for that. Justin_o, do you know?
2020-07-22T19:58:16  <Teddy___> I’m thinking it should have to do with pushing the changes to the master branch
2020-07-22T19:59:19  <Justin_o> michelled: sorry, my computer froze, I had to reboot. I can look at merging the changes if you can submit a PR Teddy___
2020-07-22T19:59:34  <michelled> oh excellent!
2020-07-22T19:59:46  <Justin_o> michelled, Teddy___: however, we'd need to push it to master, and I'm guessing there are a bunch of changes queued up in dev at the moment
2020-07-22T20:00:11  <Justin_o> michelled: is cindyli away today?
2020-07-22T20:00:26  <michelled> Justin_o, Teddy___: I think we should only make the footer change
2020-07-22T20:00:31  <michelled> so branch off master
2020-07-22T20:00:43  <michelled> Justin_o: I'm guessing she's wellness wednesdaying :)
2020-07-22T20:01:14  <Justin_o> Teddy___: can you branch off of master and submit the PR against the master branch?
2020-07-22T20:01:25  <Justin_o> michelled: okay, thanks.. that makes sense
2020-07-22T20:01:40  <michelled> thank you! and please respond to vera's message when it's done
2020-07-22T20:01:43  <michelled> thanks so much!
2020-07-22T20:01:52  <Justin_o> sute
2020-07-22T20:01:57  <Justin_o> sure
2020-07-22T20:02:02  <Teddy___> Yeah that’s what I assumed the solution was. And then netlify should take care of the rest
2020-07-22T20:02:27  <Justin_o>   Teddy___: I think so.. once we merge the PR into master it should push out the deploy
2020-07-22T20:03:31  <Justin_o> Teddy___: can you please ping me when the PR is ready for review?
2020-07-22T20:04:46  <Teddy___> will do
2020-07-22T20:05:25  <Justin_o> Teddy___: thanks :)
2020-07-22T20:09:34  <michelled> cindyli: did you see that Teddy___ and Justin_o were going to handle the footer change?
2020-07-22T20:10:09  <cindyli> just saw Teddy___'s reply. that's why i hopped on and wanna clarify who'll work on it
2020-07-22T20:11:44  <cindyli> Teddy___, Justin_o: are you already on it?
2020-07-22T20:12:04  <Teddy___> I've added the statement. It looks like we need to wait for designers for images? cindyli
2020-07-22T20:12:23  <cindyli> Teddy___: the svg image is attached in Vera's email
2020-07-22T20:13:35  <Teddy___> Okay i'll continue with that
2020-07-22T20:14:01  <cindyli> thanks, Teddy___. i'll stay online. let me know if you need help
2020-07-22T20:16:12  <Justin_o> cindyli, Teddy___: let me know if you need anything.
2020-07-22T20:21:39  <Teddy___> the `npm run start` command is not working the master branch. I believe running `npm i` will solve this but I do not want to add any extra changes to dependencies in this PR
2020-07-22T20:23:00  <Teddy___> I want to use `npm run start` to check the changes I made before pushing cindyli Justin_o
2020-07-22T20:23:06  <cindyli> Teddy___: u add it to the dev branch. i will push dev to the master branch
2020-07-22T20:23:53  <Teddy___> okay I'll redo it in the dev branch
2020-07-22T20:40:38  <Teddy___> cindyli: regardless of the uio contrast theme the text of the logo is showing white
2020-07-22T20:40:55  <Teddy___> how do I get the logo to change with the contrast theme?
2020-07-22T20:41:11  <Teddy___> as of now only the background of the logo is changing
2020-07-22T20:42:50  <Justin_o> Teddy___: how are you adding it to the site?
2020-07-22T20:43:05  <Teddy___> the svg?
2020-07-22T20:43:08  <Justin_o> yes
2020-07-22T20:43:15  <Teddy___> ```
2020-07-22T20:43:22  <Justin_o> are you adding the it as an image or embedding the svg in directly?
2020-07-22T20:43:30  <Teddy___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wBcohIQW/
2020-07-22T20:44:03  <Teddy___> I believe this is embedding?
2020-07-22T20:46:35  <cindyli> Teddy___: if you open hewlett svg file, there's a "fill" attribute being set to #fff (white), you need to use var() to customize it. if you've pushed up your branch, i can take over from there
2020-07-22T20:58:53  <Teddy___> cindyli: okay think I figured it out about to push the branch up
2020-07-22T20:59:19  <cindyli> cool
2020-07-22T21:01:34  <Teddy___> cindyli: now that there will be multiple funders on the site I think it will look better if the funder statement and logo were side by side instead of on top of each other. I will bring this for designers to decide at the we count check-in tomorrow
2020-07-22T21:05:37  <cindyli> makes sense. thanks, Teddy___
2020-07-22T21:19:12  <Teddy___> np
2020-07-22T23:00:48  <cindyli> Teddy___: all pushed up. thanks for the good work!
2020-07-22T23:01:49  <Teddy___> Awesome!
