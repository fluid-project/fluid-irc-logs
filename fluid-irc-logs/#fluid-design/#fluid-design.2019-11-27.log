2019-11-27T20:17:12  <michelled> simonjb: can I get your opinion on something?
2019-11-27T20:17:26  <simonjb> sure michelled
2019-11-27T20:18:04  <michelled> I've added a 'design' field to our JIRAs that is an url. I wanted to get your feedback on it. I've got two examples
2019-11-27T20:18:05  <michelled> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/TEST-44
2019-11-27T20:18:11  <michelled> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/TEST-37
2019-11-27T20:18:32  <michelled> I think we'd go with the first one
2019-11-27T20:19:09  <michelled> it means when update that field you need the url to the design JIRA - you won't get that helpful search you get in other contexts

2019-11-27T20:22:06  <simonjb> michelled: does that mean we would need to set the link twice? once in the Design field and once in the related issues?
2019-11-27T20:22:38  <simonjb> and empty Design field == 'design needed'?
2019-11-27T20:23:00  <michelled> we could not bother with the related issues - just use the design field I think
2019-11-27T20:23:13  <michelled> and yes, empty means 'design needed'
2019-11-27T20:23:26  <simonjb> would we get back links then? from design to feature?
2019-11-27T20:23:40  <michelled> ah, no, we wouldn't
2019-11-27T20:23:42  <michelled> good point
2019-11-27T20:24:14  <michelled> so maybe we are better with a boolean then
2019-11-27T20:24:21  <simonjb> yeah, maybe
2019-11-27T20:44:44  <michelled> simonjb: turns out there isn't a boolean option for custom fields so I'm thinking a label is best. For example https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/TEST-23
2019-11-27T20:45:15  <simonjb> looks good michelled
2019-11-27T20:45:19  <michelled> great!
