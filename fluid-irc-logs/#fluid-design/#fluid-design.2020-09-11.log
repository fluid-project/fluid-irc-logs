2020-09-11T15:48:54  <gmoss> danielcho: shall we pick up your chessboard question here? I don't know the answer, but I thought people tended to name the piece and a number
2020-09-11T15:49:15  <gmoss> like "rook 5" or something like that
2020-09-11T15:49:45  <danielcho> ah, right chess pieces have specific movements, so maybe they can omit which column it's moving to maybe?
2020-09-11T15:50:31  <danielcho> when I think about it, I remember hearing the number first as well when playing chess
2020-09-11T15:50:37  <danielcho> 5E
2020-09-11T15:50:40  <danielcho> something like that
2020-09-11T15:50:53  <gmoss> danielcho: again I'm not familiar with it at all, but this Wikipedia page shows the letter first and then number: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)
2020-09-11T15:50:53  <gmoss> maybe there are different systems
2020-09-11T15:51:02  <gmoss> I hope this is helpful!
2020-09-11T15:52:06  <danielcho> thanks gmoss :)
2020-09-11T16:45:09  <cindyli> greatislander: i'm going to write a wiki page about the architecture of the wecount website. One question is why it was decided to only use wordpress as the authoring tool rather than directly using WordPress to build the wecount site?
2020-09-11T16:45:32  <greatislander> quick call cindyli?
2020-09-11T16:45:41  <cindyli> sure, wecount room, greatislander?
2020-09-11T16:45:44  <greatislander> yep
