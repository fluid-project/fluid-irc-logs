2020-07-03T19:29:22  <greatislander> alanharnum: just so I can track it, I'm going to open a PR from the `filters` branch (which I believe is where you are working) to the `dev` branch, and once you're done with your work on glossary stuff you can request my review. Sound good?
2020-07-03T19:30:17  <greatislander> actually maybe it makes sense for you to open it as I won't be able to request my own review if I do
2020-07-03T19:30:19  <alanharnum> greatislander: is there an existing dev branch? I've now switched to a branch called 'development' for the work based on our conversation, since it made more sense than 'filters'.
2020-07-03T19:30:34  <greatislander> oh there is a remote branch called `dev`
2020-07-03T19:30:43  <greatislander> https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-tool-library/tree/dev
2020-07-03T19:31:15  <alanharnum> ah i see - it's only a local name so far, so let me rename my branch to something and I'll PR from that one to dev when the time comes
2020-07-03T19:32:16  <alanharnum> renamed local branch to "mvp", will PR from that one to "dev"
2020-07-03T19:36:11  <greatislander> awesome thanks!
