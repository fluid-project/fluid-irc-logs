2019-11-12T16:28:52  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: shall we do planning in a few minutes? Michelle is away today
2019-11-12T16:29:09  <clown> sure gmoss.  zoom?
2019-11-12T16:29:10  <gmoss> say 11:35?
2019-11-12T16:29:16  <cindyli> sure
2019-11-12T16:29:18  <danielcho> sure
2019-11-12T16:29:20  <gmoss> I'll be connecting to the Zoom meeting in the collab room
2019-11-12T16:31:38  <clown> gmoss: , I don't have the collab room coordinates.  I just have the fluid standup zoom room
2019-11-12T16:32:04  <gmoss> clown: I'll be connecting via the computer in the collab room, so there's no need to dial the room as with Vidyo
2019-11-12T16:32:30  <gmoss> *collab room = the physical space here at 205
2019-11-12T16:33:05  <jhung> danayo_ and I are in the Zoom room https://ocadu.zoom.us/j/727986784
2019-11-12T17:04:44  <jhung> cherylhjli when do you want to debrief about the conference? Maybe when Ned and Michelle are back?
2019-11-12T17:08:52  <cherylhjli> jhung - I think we can do at least a little debriefing when Ned is online, and then maybe when Michelle is back when can fill her in on the important parts? I feel like I'm going to forget a few things by Thursday! What does everyone else think? danayo_ colinclark?
2019-11-12T17:09:35  <colinclark> Yes, sooner rather than later sounds like a good plan
2019-11-12T17:09:35  <danayo_> michelle is back tomorrow cherylhjli
2019-11-12T17:09:47  <danayo_> but I’m happy to meet today
2019-11-12T17:09:49  <colinclark> but yes, good point danayo_
2019-11-12T17:09:52  <colinclark> Michelle will be back soon
2019-11-12T17:10:00  <cherylhjli> oh! in that case we can wait until tomorrow
2019-11-12T17:10:04  <cherylhjli> sorry I must have misread her email
2019-11-12T17:10:35  <cherylhjli> in that case are we not doing iteration planning today then?
2019-11-12T17:11:35  <colinclark> I think it would be reasonable to wait for this
2019-11-12T17:11:42  <colinclark> if Ned and Michelle will both miss it
2019-11-12T17:12:14  <colinclark> but I’d like to check in with you today, cherylhjli if you’ve got some time
2019-11-12T17:12:17  <cherylhjli> I think Ned mentioned he'd be online by 1 EDT so he'd make iteration planning, but if Michelle is back tomorrow then let's wait until tomorrow
2019-11-12T17:12:20  <cherylhjli> yes colinclark let's check in today
2019-11-12T17:12:35  <cherylhjli> in terms of the vice article situation - it would also be good to check in on that today as well, perhaps after Ned hops online?
2019-11-12T17:12:52  <colinclark> Let’s you and I talk about it first, and then go from there
2019-11-12T17:13:01  <cherylhjli> sure colinclark, do you want to talk now?
2019-11-12T17:13:24  <colinclark> no, i’m going to head into the office shortly
2019-11-12T17:13:26  <colinclark> we can talk then
2019-11-12T17:13:29  <cherylhjli> sure
2019-11-12T17:13:39  <colinclark> I just need to make sure Darcie’s all set for the rest of her day here
2019-11-12T17:13:54  <colinclark> She had her appendix out this weekend, so still needs help with a few things
2019-11-12T17:13:59  <cherylhjli> ouch! yeah of course

2019-11-12T17:44:34  <gmoss> danayo_: I've added the new resources (thanks for those last descriptions :)) and fixed a couple of dead links, and I've opened a pull request to merge that in. I think before it's merged in, we could show Liam the build preview instead of pushing it to production right away. what do you think?
2019-11-12T17:44:36  <gmoss> danayo_: https://deploy-preview-68--social-justice-repair-kit.netlify.com/
2019-11-12T17:46:42  <danayo_> good idea gmoss - one thing I noticed was the formatting of the headers (resource titles) is insconsistent for some of them
2019-11-12T17:46:50  <danayo_> *inconsistent
2019-11-12T17:47:15  <gmoss> danayo_: I attempted to introduce the italicizing that is in the word doc, I can remove that if you'd prefer the consistency :)
2019-11-12T17:47:54  <danayo_> that would be great gmoss, the google doc formatting was purely happenstance
2019-11-12T17:47:55  <danayo_> :)
2019-11-12T17:50:18  <gmoss> danayo_: that should be solved on the build site now :)
2019-11-12T17:50:29  <gmoss> *deploy preview
2019-11-12T17:51:05  <gmoss> danayo_: I'm going to head out and grab a bite to eat, now, but please let me know if you have any other changes to make!
2019-11-12T17:51:37  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo_ jhung I'm online now!
2019-11-12T17:51:53  <danayo_> thanks gmoss
2019-11-12T17:51:56  <greatislander> I gather we are postponing co-op iteration planning until tomorrow but do we still want to check in?
2019-11-12T17:51:58  <danayo_> hello greatislander!
2019-11-12T17:52:02  <jhung> greatislander welcome back
2019-11-12T17:52:08  <greatislander> thanks!
2019-11-12T17:56:50  <danayo_> fluid-everyone: a great video about artist artist Persimmon Blackbridge, accessible art, disability art https://vimeo.com/353625283
2019-11-12T17:57:40  <greatislander> danayo_ that is an awesome name. Also this looks really cool!
2019-11-12T17:58:21  <danayo_> greatislander: yeah her work is really interesting
2019-11-12T17:59:07  <danayo_> greatislander: I’m super eager to hear about the conference! but wonder if it would be best to wait until tomorrow to include michelle? also happy to meet if there are pressing things you and/or cherylhjli want to check in about
2019-11-12T17:59:39  <danayo_> I think colin is on his way into office as well
2019-11-12T17:59:41  <greatislander> Yes, agreed it would make sense to do a proper check-in tomorrow. I don't know that there's anything pressing

2019-11-12T20:37:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2019-11-12T20:38:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome. greatislander please feel free to join us if you're free
