2020-07-27T13:27:48  <michelled> hey gtirloni, vera and caren manage snow so if you don't get a reply to your message you might want to ask them directly
2020-07-27T13:36:18  <gtirloni> michelled: thanks!
2020-07-27T13:40:39  <michelled> np
2020-07-27T14:07:05  <gtirloni> michelled: I was wondering if this website has been superseded by the fluid's build website, any ideas? https://demo.floeproject.org/demos/
2020-07-27T14:08:06  <michelled> oh my, been a long time since I saw that
2020-07-27T14:08:26  <michelled> I can't remember what it is exactly :) Justin_o do you remember?
2020-07-27T14:12:11  <Justin_o> gtirloni, michelled: I didn't realize that was still up
2020-07-27T14:13:02  <michelled> was that part of infusion at one point?
2020-07-27T14:13:16  <Justin_o> the contents would have originated from some infusion build, and we replace the portal with just direct linking to the demos on the build site. However, I don't know if this particular link was for a grant and etc.
2020-07-27T14:13:38  <Justin_o> the portal itself used to be included in infusion
2020-07-27T14:13:47  <michelled> but it isn't anymore?
2020-07-27T14:13:59  <michelled> my cursory check didn't lead to anywhere that links to it
2020-07-27T14:14:17  <Justin_o> nope we don't use the portal in infusion any more
2020-07-27T14:14:23  <Justin_o> looks like this came from Infusion 1.5
2020-07-27T14:14:43  <Justin_o> We also used to host demos from releases so that you could see stable vs nightly
2020-07-27T14:16:25  <michelled> gtirloni: let's ask colin when he's around in case he remembers a reason we should keep that up. otherwise, I'd suggest we take it down
2020-07-27T14:16:30  <michelled> Justin_o: do you agree?
2020-07-27T14:17:31  <Justin_o> michelled: if we're not linking to it anywhere, I don't think we need it
2020-07-27T14:23:58  <gtirloni> ok, thanks
2020-07-27T14:27:07  <gtirloni> :)
2020-07-27T14:30:54  <cindyli> Justin_o: regarding your wecount pull request for integrating lighthouse CI - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/293, can you merge in the dev branch that now has the fix for the accessibility test failure. thanks
2020-07-27T14:32:13  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, I'll do that shortly
2020-07-27T14:33:48  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2020-07-27T14:49:24  <Justin_o> cindyli: I've updated the PR, but the mobile check is failing due to best practices. Probably around the image size.
2020-07-27T14:49:38  <Justin_o> cindyli: https://storage.googleapis.com/lighthouse-infrastructure.appspot.com/reports/1595861188950-84493.report.html#best-practices
2020-07-27T14:49:46  <cindyli> thanks, having a look
2020-07-27T16:17:59  <cindyli> Justin_o, Teddy___: what lighthouse complaints about is a bit strange to me - https://storage.googleapis.com/lighthouse-infrastructure.appspot.com/reports/1595861188950-84493.report.html#best-practices. Lighthouse reports that the image aspect ratio is not maintained at the display. According to the lighthouse suggestion about this failure - https://web.dev/image-aspect-ratio/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools, this failure
2020-07-27T16:17:59  <cindyli>  is reported when any image has a rendered aspect ratio 5 percent or more different from its natural ratio. if we looked at the report, the displayed size is 306 x 160 with a aspect ratio 1.9125 and the expected size is 804 x 420 which has aspect ratio 1.914. the difference between these ratios is nowhere near 5%.
2020-07-27T16:18:05  <cindyli> i wonder if i missed anything
2020-07-27T16:19:25  <cindyli> Justin_o: you also mentioned at the standup that this might be lighthouse expecting a larger image. but displaying a size of 804 x 420 on mobile is not reasonable
2020-07-27T16:19:28  <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. interesting.. let see
2020-07-27T16:19:50  <Justin_o> cindyli: I was thinking we could go the other way, that is, supply a smaller image to mobile than the native
2020-07-27T16:20:13  <Justin_o> so smaller image to mobile, and larger image to desktop
2020-07-27T16:21:29  <Justin_o> if we are only going to show it at a smaller size, then we are potentially sending down a large file over a mobile network for no reason.
2020-07-27T16:27:12  <cindyli> Justin_o: the size of the image is controlled by the content creator in WordPress and WP will send the selected size. also, the size of the image should have nothing to do with the displayed aspect ratio
2020-07-27T16:31:06  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-07-27T16:31:21  <michelled> yup

2020-07-27T17:30:04  <Justin_o> cindyli: I'm looking at the dev site now, and it does look like you supply different sized images based on the media query using the srcset attripute

2020-07-27T17:36:55  <gtirloni> colinclark: hi, welcome back! We were discussing if the demo.floeproject.org website is still needed, any thoughts? previous discussion: http://irc-logs.fluidproject.org/%23fluid-design/%23fluid-design.2020-07-27.log
