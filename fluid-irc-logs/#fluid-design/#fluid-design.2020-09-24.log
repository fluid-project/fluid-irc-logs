2020-09-24T12:48:02  <greatislander> Morning, Justin_o. I'm wondering if there's any agreed-upon style rules for CSS/SCSS used in Fluid projects? I was thinking it might be beneficial to establish a shared configuration for Stylelint which could be included in fluid-grunt-lint-all.
2020-09-24T12:48:46  <greatislander> This is what cindyli, Teddy and I used for We Count: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/stylelint.config.js
2020-09-24T12:50:50  <Justin_o> greatislander: hmm.. there's this for naming. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards#CodingandCommitStandards-CSSNamingConventions
2020-09-24T12:51:46  <Justin_o> I'm not sure there's much else formally defined, but we can look at how we've been doing things in our various projects to see a pattern
2020-09-24T12:52:00  <Justin_o> greatislander: what's included in stylelint-config-standard-scss
2020-09-24T12:52:58  <greatislander> It's this configuration plus SCSS support (@-rules etc): https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard/blob/master/index.js
2020-09-24T12:53:14  <greatislander> Lots of rules but I've found that I agree with them as a whole
2020-09-24T12:54:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks, I'll talk a look at that.. we should also talk to the-t-in_ if you want more linting including in fluid-grunt-lint-all
2020-09-24T12:54:41  <greatislander> Sounds good. I found https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-stylelint so it looks like adding support for stylesheet linting should be fairly straightforward
2020-09-24T12:58:23  <Justin_o> greatislander: looks like stylelint works with SCSS, do you know if it works with stylus?
2020-09-24T13:00:35  <greatislander> I’m not entirely sure, Justin_o. I’ll look into it.
2020-09-24T13:00:41  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-09-24T13:02:42  <greatislander> Appears not because Stylus can be used in a way that does not resemble CSS syntax. I know we don’t use it that way but it appears that Stylelint doesn’t support it.
2020-09-24T13:03:30  <greatislander> I stand corrected: there is an experimental plugin. https://github.com/ota-meshi/stylelint-plugin-stylus
2020-09-24T13:17:31  <greatislander> Justin_o I filed a JIRA about this: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6555
2020-09-24T13:28:56  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks.. although I think you probably should file that at https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/issues instead.
2020-09-24T13:30:26  <greatislander> ah, okay. My thought process was that the shareable configuration would need to be created and then integrated into fluid-grunt-lint-all (much like we have a separate repository for eslint-config-fluid
2020-09-24T13:30:47  <Justin_o> greatislander: you might also want to make a proposal on the fluid-work list about it and specifically about the rules that you want to adopt by default. It would be helpful to include reasons where necessary too.
2020-09-24T13:30:57  <greatislander> okay, makes sense
2020-09-24T13:31:11  <Justin_o> sure if the shareable configs work like eslint a separate repo for that part makes sense.
2020-09-24T13:33:11  <Justin_o> so I guess the portion that would be needed to update fluid-grunt-lint-all you could write a ticket in its own issue tracker.. I guess we can keep the one you filed as a task for the new repo and start tracking the issues for it in Github once it has been established.. But we'd probably do that after we sort things out through the proposal on the mailing list I guess.
2020-09-24T13:34:34  <greatislander> makes sense.
2020-09-24T13:37:33  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks for looking into this
2020-09-24T13:37:39  <greatislander> no problem!
2020-09-24T13:41:53  <greatislander> Also Justin_o I switched to `infusion-uio.min.js` as per your suggestion, I think that PR is good to go now.
2020-09-24T13:59:19  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks, I'll try to take a look at that today
2020-09-24T14:06:25  <greatislander> awesome, thanks Justin_o
2020-09-24T16:13:16  <michelled> sepidehshahi: do you have a few minutes to check in?
2020-09-24T16:13:35  <sepidehshahi> Sure michelled
2020-09-24T16:13:50  <michelled> I'll call you on skype
2020-09-24T16:13:54  <sepidehshahi> sure
2020-09-24T17:37:56  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o, I'm wondering if you have a few moments to look at something with me before end of day?
2020-09-24T17:39:37  <Justin_o> greatislander: sure, i can make time for the next hour
2020-09-24T17:39:58  <greatislander> okay great! General room?
2020-09-24T17:40:38  <Justin_o> sure
2020-09-24T17:47:24  <Justin_o> greatislander: you've probably noticed this already, but there are some additional places where we need to correct links back to the repo, where they used to point at Sachin's I guess that's another thing to keep an eye out for as you make changes.
2020-09-24T17:47:42  <greatislander> yep, caught another when I looked at Authors.md
2020-09-24T17:51:57  <greatislander> Justin_o: I think I've addressed all your comments. Thanks again!
2020-09-24T17:52:26  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks.. I'll take another look
2020-09-24T18:17:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - is the 11ty version of the fluid-docs being pushed forward?
2020-09-24T18:21:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, I believe jhung is going to be continuing that work
2020-09-24T18:22:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we were having some discussions about trying to get open PRs triaged and merging what we can
2020-09-24T18:24:17  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you are able to take a pass over them and sort them out that would really helpful
2020-09-24T18:24:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  we were also talking about the versioning and your suggestion for using the style similar to what jQuery does to show which version a change was introduced in.
2020-09-24T18:25:11  <Justin_o> but I think that might have to come with some future changes after we've already migrated to 11ty
2020-09-24T18:35:05  <jhung> Bosmon I started to look at it, but it may be a while before I have some cycles to dedicate toward it. If others have time to pick up that work, it would be great.
2020-09-24T18:37:16  <Bosmon> Sure, I will try to take a look and see how things stand
2020-09-24T19:07:46  <greatislander> Hi jhung, do you have a few minutes for a check-in?
2020-09-24T19:21:06  <jhung> greatislander general room?
2020-09-24T19:21:11  <greatislander> sure!
