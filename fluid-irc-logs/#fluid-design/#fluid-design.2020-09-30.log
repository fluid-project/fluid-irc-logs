2020-09-30T14:24:48  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o, I am working on an Eleventy plugin that will be incorporated into the Fluidic Eleventy starter kit. what's the most efficient way to get it transferred into fluid-project? I transfer it to you? Currently it's here: https://github.com/greatislander/eleventy-plugin-fluid
2020-09-30T14:25:13  <Justin_o> greatislander: yes, I can help with that.
2020-09-30T14:25:21  <Justin_o> you can transfer to me and I can transfer it in
2020-09-30T14:25:26  <Justin_o> what does the plugin do?
2020-09-30T14:26:54  <greatislander> jhung and I had been talking about how whenever we add new functionality (filters, shortcodes, etc) to fluidic-11ty, sites based on it will have to copy/paste a bunch of configuration boilerplate and files into their project to get the new features. An Eleventy Plugin lets you register shortcodes, transforms, filters, etc and enable them all by loading the plugin.
2020-09-30T14:27:43  <greatislander> So basically what this will let us do is move a bunch of the functionality from fluidic-11ty into this plugin so updating sites based on fluidic-11ty with new features and capabilities can happen via a package update instead of copy/pasting from the starter kit
2020-09-30T14:28:02  <greatislander> Here's an example of what that looks like: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/33
2020-09-30T14:29:08  <greatislander> I've requested the transfer, Justin_o
2020-09-30T14:31:08  <Justin_o> greatislander: so basically fluidic-11ty is just a template that includes plugins. and the core features are primarily handled by through the plugin itself?
2020-09-30T14:31:56  <greatislander> fluidic-11ty provides the project structure and a sensible templating starting point, yes
2020-09-30T14:32:05  <greatislander> and the features are brought in through the plugin
2020-09-30T14:33:10  <colinclark> I’m so excited that we have this, greatislander
2020-09-30T14:33:13  <colinclark> thank you :)
2020-09-30T14:33:23  <greatislander> :) I think it's going to work really nicely!
2020-09-30T14:35:35  <greatislander> Justin_o once it's transferred into fluid-project, let me know and I will update that branch with the correct NPM reference (https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/33/files#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R26)
2020-09-30T14:36:19  <Justin_o> greatislander: I wonder if we should call this repo 11ty-plugin-fluid or is there some naming convention for eleventy plugins
2020-09-30T14:36:45  <Justin_o> okay, does look like there is a naming convention
2020-09-30T14:39:44  <Justin_o> greatislander: https://github.com/fluid-project/eleventy-plugin-fluid
2020-09-30T14:43:56  <greatislander> awesome, thanks!
2020-09-30T15:10:29  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: the standup room URL has changed. The new URL is included in the calendar event.
2020-09-30T15:11:20  <clown> Justin_o:   I take it you don't want to publish it here for security reasons.
2020-09-30T15:11:38  <Justin_o> I'm not sure it matters entirely, but yet just in case
2020-09-30T15:11:41  * clown looks at calendar
2020-09-30T15:11:50  <clown> got it, thanks Justin_o
2020-09-30T15:12:00  <Justin_o> clown: if you could also test the link to makes sure it works, that would be helpful
2020-09-30T15:12:06  <clown> yes, it's good to be cautious.
2020-09-30T15:12:12  <clown> okay
2020-09-30T15:13:30  <clown> It comes up as "Weekly Coding Zoom Meeting", Justin_o
2020-09-30T15:14:07  <clown> never mind,  I got the wrong link from the calendar.
2020-09-30T15:14:11  <clown> Just a second.
2020-09-30T15:14:52  <greatislander> Justin_o for me I'm still seeing the old link in the "Where" field, and the new one is in the body of the invite
2020-09-30T15:15:06  <danielcho> clown: Bridges team was confused and told us there's a person named Joseph in the waiting room haha
2020-09-30T15:15:10  <Justin_o> greatislander: I just updated that a few seconds ago..
2020-09-30T15:15:15  <greatislander> ah perfect
2020-09-30T15:15:17  <Justin_o> so it might take a minute to come across
2020-09-30T15:15:27  <greatislander> just got it, thanks Justin_o
2020-09-30T15:15:47  <Justin_o> :)
2020-09-30T15:15:51  * clown waves at Bridges team
2020-09-30T15:16:00  <danielcho> :)
2020-09-30T15:16:32  <greatislander> Hi gtirloni, I'm running into a puzzling issue with a Docker build. Specifically running npm install fails to install a dependency referenced via a GitHub repository (the dependency is not published to NPM yet). Have you ever encountered this? Logs are here: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/15/checks
2020-09-30T15:16:42  * clown more specifically wave goodbye to Bridges team
2020-09-30T15:19:23  <gtirloni> greatislander: yeah, you may need to install git in the builder stage: `RUN apk add --no-cache git`
2020-09-30T15:19:27  <gtirloni> before npm install
2020-09-30T15:19:34  <greatislander> ah thanks! :)
2020-09-30T15:19:37  <greatislander> I'll try that
2020-09-30T16:02:13  <colinclark> clown: i’m loving this Les Mis song, thanks :)
2020-09-30T16:04:23  <clown> colinclark: :-)
2020-09-30T16:05:18  <clown> can't explain it, but at yesterday's meeting, Kasper said, "we are down to one more day", and that song immediately popped into my head.
2020-09-30T16:14:37  <colinclark> it makes perfect sense
2020-09-30T16:19:36  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I've updated the standup room passcode again. The calendar and wiki links have been updated.
2020-09-30T16:28:08  <clown> colinclark:  and now, "Tomorrow" from Annie just popped into my head.
2020-09-30T16:28:10  <clown> sheesh

2020-09-30T16:28:42  <colinclark> clown: gotta say, i love that song
2020-09-30T16:29:40  <colinclark> greatislander: lol, i sent it to the group fo current and former GPIIers
2020-09-30T16:33:25  <clown> greatislander:  perfect.
