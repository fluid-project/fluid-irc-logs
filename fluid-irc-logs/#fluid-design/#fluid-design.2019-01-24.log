2019-01-24T15:26:15  <gmoss> simonjb michelled: I'm currently in transit, I should be at the IDRC by 11 barring any unexpected delays. If not I'll join remotely from a cafe or something

2019-01-24T16:15:47  <caren> hello all. Noticed on a subway poster that the IDRC is a partner in the Toronto Kids Digital Festival : https://www.kidsdigitalfestival.com/ Will we be contributing anything over the three days in March (12-14)?
2019-01-24T16:51:54  <danayo> everyone: for those who weren’t at standup - saw this incredible show last night from Toronto theatre company Why Not Theatre that incorporates sign language in the most amazing way https://www.theatrewhynot.org/project/prince-hamlet/
2019-01-24T16:53:01  <danayo> and they also used sound in a really cool way - I think much of it was designed with vibration in mind
2019-01-24T16:53:43  <danayo> looks like they’re in Toronto in Feb
2019-01-24T17:00:00  <sepidehshahi> caren I have been talking to one of the presenters and she is hoping to have a community meeting on Feb 6th. I’m not aware of any other IDRC involvement in that festival

2019-01-24T20:22:38  <colinclark> will do, thanks sepidehshahi
2019-01-24T20:22:47  <sepidehshahi> Thank you so much!

2019-01-24T20:32:37  <danayo> sepidehshahi, caren - sorry, just a few minutes
2019-01-24T20:32:57  <caren> np danayo !
2019-01-24T20:32:57  <sepidehshahi> no rush
2019-01-24T20:33:15  <colinclark> I'm just going to reread the CC license real quick regarding irrevocability
2019-01-24T20:35:08  <colinclark> sepidehshahi: I love it, nice work
2019-01-24T20:35:21  <colinclark> it's so hard to communicate these concepts in simple terms
2019-01-24T20:35:37  <sepidehshahi> Thanks so much colinclark for reviewing it and your edits
2019-01-24T20:35:38  <colinclark> For a printable version, should we also make sure that the URL of the CC license is visible?
2019-01-24T20:36:19  <sepidehshahi> I know … particularly most of our participants are second language. I’ll send these forms to them tomorrow so they will have almost 10 days before the workshop to read and understand the terms
2019-01-24T20:36:50  <colinclark> great
2019-01-24T20:37:03  <danayo> sepidehshahi, caren, michelled1, I can meet anytime
2019-01-24T20:37:10  <colinclark> I mean, i'm trying to think if maybe we could distill down into a form that would fit on a business card
2019-01-24T20:37:28  <colinclark> "Others can share your work freely"
2019-01-24T20:37:36  <sepidehshahi> yes!
2019-01-24T20:37:37  <colinclark> "They can also modify it or make changes to it"
2019-01-24T20:37:42  <colinclark> "They have to give you credit"
2019-01-24T20:38:04  <sepidehshahi> great! thanks colinclark
2019-01-24T20:38:11  <colinclark> something along those lines
2019-01-24T20:38:26  <sepidehshahi> sure, I’ll modify it
2019-01-24T20:38:36  <colinclark> these things are never a substitute for providing the full license, but they might help people navigate them better
2019-01-24T20:38:51  <sepidehshahi> for sure
2019-01-24T20:39:05  <sepidehshahi> caren: danayo and michelled1 I have unlocked my room
2019-01-24T20:40:41  <michelled1> sepidehshahi: I'm sorry, I have another meeting, can you catch me up tomorrow?
2019-01-24T20:41:04  <sepidehshahi> no worries michelled1
2019-01-24T20:41:10  <sepidehshahi> danayo: we are in my room
