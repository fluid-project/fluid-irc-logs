2020-06-01T17:46:56  <erictheise> greatislander & gtirloni my morning is back to back phone calls but I will review your pull requests shortly after noon Pacific.
2020-06-01T17:48:40  <greatislander> thanks erictheise!
2020-06-01T17:52:44  <colinclark> cherylhjli, danayo: Just to be clear, I donâ€™t think we need to add additional scope to our last month
2020-06-01T17:53:07  <colinclark> but thinking through that workflow might help in terms of knowing a) whether we can do squeeze it in and b) what it would take for us or someone else to add it later
2020-06-01T17:53:53  <danayo> colinclark: that makes sense to me
2020-06-01T17:54:36  <cherylhjli> yep makes sense to me!
2020-06-01T17:56:15  <cherylhjli> can we debrief real quick? there are still a few things i'm not super clear on
2020-06-01T17:56:20  <cherylhjli> danayo colinclark
2020-06-01T17:56:33  <colinclark> sure
2020-06-01T17:56:50  <cherylhjli> back in the coop room?
2020-06-01T17:56:55  <danayo> sure
2020-06-01T17:58:54  <jhung> greatislander just a heads up, the inline link PR that was merge wasn't complete.
2020-06-01T17:59:28  <jhung> I'll submit a new PR with the remaining changes.
2020-06-01T17:59:42  <greatislander> oh, sorry jhung.
2020-06-01T18:00:00  <jhung> no worries. It was functional, just not complete. :)
2020-06-01T18:00:40  <greatislander> hah, okay.
2020-06-01T18:06:24  <cherylhjli> iteration planning michelled jhung?
