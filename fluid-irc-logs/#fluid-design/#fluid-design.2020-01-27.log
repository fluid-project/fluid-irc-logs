2020-01-27T17:42:52  <erictheise> I need to head out, my last day in Oaxaca. Today I'll finish removing some credentials from my codebase and push to your repo. I'll add link up one more db table (for Activites) and will see how that confomrs with the finalized taxonomy doc that was emailed last week.
2020-01-27T17:43:31  <erictheise> Planning to listen in on the SEWA meeting later tonight.
2020-01-27T17:49:29  <cherylhjli> jhung greatislander erictheise: could we meet at 3 about the designs?
2020-01-27T17:49:38  <greatislander> works for me

2020-01-27T17:50:54  <erictheise> sorry, stepped away.
2020-01-27T17:52:06  <erictheise> tomorrow would be better when i'm laying over in dallas/fort worth, that' should be between 11 CST and the chat with Olivera.
2020-01-27T17:52:50  <erictheise> We-Fr I'm home and become much more flexible.
2020-01-27T17:54:32  <cherylhjli> yep 3 eastern! eric it's for the resource library not the directory though, so if you'd like to be there no prob we can find a time but if not we can fill you in too
2020-01-27T17:54:46  <cherylhjli> sorry I should've clarified!
2020-01-27T17:55:12  <greatislander> there is a We Count meeting at 3:30 which I need to attend
2020-01-27T17:59:34  <cherylhjli> i think danayo requested we do it at 3 instead of earlier. perhaps we can talk as much as we can today and then resume tomorrow

2020-01-27T18:16:37  <greatislander> I'm actually back online now but have hesitated to say anything in case I jinx it
2020-01-27T18:16:43  <greatislander> could try for a check in if you would like?
2020-01-27T18:17:11  <jhung> I promise not to bring up the Wifi in case it unravels when I say it.

2020-01-27T21:36:06  <jhung> greatislander I tested the middle-dot character and NVDA does not give any feedback. The behaviour is like it's ignored.
2020-01-27T21:36:18  <greatislander> that sounds like what we want!
2020-01-27T21:37:18  <jhung> greatislander  Yeah. I think we should mark it as presentation anyway to be sure. Not sure how other ATs treat it.
