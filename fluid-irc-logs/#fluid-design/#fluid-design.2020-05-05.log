2020-05-05T14:38:17  <cindyli> greatislander: regarding adding the pagination to the search result page, my original thought, which we talked yesterday, was to try to reuse "pagination.njk" by passing in a dynamically generated pagination object in the structure required by Eleventy pagination - https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/#paging-an-object. after some experiments, i found this solution won't work because Eleventy pagination is designed to work with sta
2020-05-05T14:38:17  <cindyli> tic data. I cannot expect this code - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/src/views.njk#L28-L30 can consume a dynamic "pagination" object. so my next solution is to write a new pagination layout in vue (hopefully by modifying the pagination.vue in the nuxt branch) to handle the dynamic data. before i dive into this solution, i figure your opinion is valuable in case you have a better solution.
2020-05-05T14:42:53  <greatislander> Hi cindyli, I think using a Vue pagination layout makes sense. What I would suggest is using the same pagination data model as Eleventy (see the section here right after "Here's what's in `pagination`: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/#paging-an-array)
2020-05-05T14:43:26  <greatislander> Then we can replace the Nunjucks pagination template with the Vue pagination template once https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-vue is released!
2020-05-05T14:43:38  <greatislander> Let me know if that makes sense
2020-05-05T14:44:55  <cindyli> cool, greatislander, is the data model in the 2nd script block in your link:
2020-05-05T14:45:00  <cindyli> {
2020-05-05T14:45:00  <cindyli>   items: [], // Array of current page’s chunk of data
2020-05-05T14:45:00  <cindyli>   pageNumber: 0, // current page number, 0 indexed
2020-05-05T14:45:00  <cindyli>   // Cool URLs, new in v0.10.0
2020-05-05T14:45:00  <cindyli>   hrefs: [], // Array of all page hrefs (in order)
2020-05-05T14:45:00  <cindyli> …
2020-05-05T14:45:07  <greatislander> Exactly cindyli
2020-05-05T14:45:09  <cindyli> yes, that's the structure i looked at
2020-05-05T14:45:13  <cindyli> great. thanks

2020-05-05T16:08:08  <Justin_o> michelled, jhung, gmoss: just looking through the my GSoC related docs. I think in the past we've only post news items for 1) about GSoC project ideas to request applications ( we don't do that any more or haven't for a while ) and 2) after the completion of GSoC to summarize the students work. Do we also want to do one to announce our participating in GSoC and what we'll be working on. Or just hold off on the

I think it'll be good to get some granular feedback so that these screens can be "done enough".
