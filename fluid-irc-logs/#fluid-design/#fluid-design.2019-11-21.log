2019-11-21T12:58:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: still working on FLUID-6420 and the issues I'm having with getting the subcomponents.. I think the issue may actually be that the "loaderGrade" isn't being passed along at all.. that might just be part of the problem though.
2019-11-21T12:58:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the issue I'm seeing is that my distribution isn't working.
2019-11-21T12:59:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - what kind of not working is it? : P
2019-11-21T12:59:24  <Justin_o> sorry, getting something to show you
2019-11-21T12:59:45  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/va8M6Bd0/
2019-11-21T12:59:49  <Justin_o> so that's the distribution
2019-11-21T13:00:02  <Justin_o> and it doesn't appear to be passing along the value from the source.
2019-11-21T13:00:22  <Justin_o> I did a simple test of targeting a new option, and it didn't appear
2019-11-21T13:00:55  <Justin_o> however, if I changed the source to "{that}.options.auxSchema" I do get the whole auxSchema object distributed and it includes the loaderGrades property
2019-11-21T13:02:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-11-21T13:12:58  *** alanharnum <alanharnum!uid363993@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-vgvarauurmgekiek> has joined #fluid-design
2019-11-21T13:14:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's pretty odd
2019-11-21T13:14:38  <Bosmon> And you're in master's framework?
2019-11-21T13:14:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2019-11-21T13:16:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - "by eye" this actually looks like it might be a bug
2019-11-21T13:16:37  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L212
2019-11-21T13:18:06  <Bosmon> It looks like it only throws in the material from the block if it is an exact match with the source structure
2019-11-21T13:19:14  <Justin_o> but isn't it a match?
2019-11-21T13:19:17  <Justin_o> in my case
2019-11-21T13:19:39  <Bosmon> Well, I imagine that you have no configuration explicitly written with the path {that}.options.auxSchema.loaderGrades
2019-11-21T13:20:57  <Bosmon> Don't you have an issue in any case that ordinarily this stuff is evaluated at the target rather than at the source?
2019-11-21T13:23:05  <Bosmon> "source" options distributions are really pretty literal-minded and simply move the entire source configuration from place to place
2019-11-21T13:24:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so you mean that it would have to actually be directly written into the defaults of a grade?
2019-11-21T13:25:05  <Bosmon> This may not always be what people want, there is a lot of discussion worrying about "source" distributions here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5836
2019-11-21T13:25:29  <Justin_o> the auxSchema property currently is created through a mergePolicy that just copies basically distributes the objected stored at the expandedAuxSchema property
2019-11-21T13:25:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it may be safer, although look a bit nutty, to instead distribute a "record" which resolves upwards onto where you know the gradeName has been computed
2019-11-21T13:25:47  <Justin_o> which is itself created from an expander that takes in the auxiliarySchema property as an argument
2019-11-21T13:26:29  <Bosmon> "source" distributions are primarily meant for facade-type applications where you want some component to behave as if it had directly received some INPUT configuration which had been written elsewhere
2019-11-21T13:26:49  <Bosmon> Right now if you want to consume "output", that is, some fully expanded/evaluated material, it is better to just reference it in place
2019-11-21T13:27:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: well, this stuff was done before with an IoC expression in the gradeNames
2019-11-21T13:27:20  <Justin_o> maybe I'll try that again
2019-11-21T13:29:02  <Bosmon> Justin_o - note that we are in fluid-design : P
2019-11-21T13:29:11  <Justin_o> oh :(
2019-11-21T13:29:17  <Justin_o> thanks
2019-11-21T13:29:56  <Justin_o> we had a recent meeting about the IDRC site and it was mentioned that we might want to open a new more general channel, and I mentioned how I often talk about things in the wrong channel already

2019-11-21T20:03:34  <cindyli> i hope it's not because I pushed the entire stories-floe-dev instead of just GPII-297 pull request. I looked at the difference btw stories-floe-dev and stories-floe-production before the push, seemed safe but i could be wrong â€¦
