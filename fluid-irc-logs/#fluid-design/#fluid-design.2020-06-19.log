2020-06-19T14:41:47  <alanharnum> cherylhjli greatislander: looking at Pinecone for the accordion (going to try to implement the side filtering design for the Tool Library) and seeing differences between the sample HTML and the rendered, specifically that the control button doesn't appear in the sample HTML but does if I examine the source in Pinecone's display. Also wondering how I can access the interactivity Javascript to adapt for Svelte.
2020-06-19T14:42:07  <alanharnum> this is the accordion I'm referring to: https://pinecone.platform.coop/components/detail/accordion--default.html
2020-06-19T15:02:44  <greatislander> Morning alanharnum, here's the source for the Accordion JS: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/blob/dev/src/assets/scripts/Pinecone/Accordion/index.js
2020-06-19T15:03:52  <greatislander> The reason for the difference in source and rendered HTML is that the accordion component in Pinecone uses progressive enhancement, so the control is added by Javascript (if Javascript is disabled it's a list of headers/sections).
2020-06-19T15:04:02  <greatislander> Let me know if there's anything else you need@
2020-06-19T15:04:24  <alanharnum> ah, got it
2020-06-19T15:04:29  <alanharnum> thanks! that should do it
2020-06-19T15:05:06  <alanharnum> wasn't clear on exatly what Pinecone was doing, but straightforward now :)
2020-06-19T15:06:11  <alanharnum> greatislander: one other question: do we have a layout in Pinecone or elsewhere for the sidebar style we see in cherylhjli's XD designs? I can make one easily enough, but don't want to duplicate work. I looked around in Pinecone and didn't see an example.
2020-06-19T15:08:06  <greatislander> Hi alanharnum, there isn't a generic sidebar layout but if you look at Layouts â†’ Archive (and the corresponding SCSS file) you should be able to borrow and adapt. https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/blob/dev/src/assets/styles/layouts/_archive.scss
