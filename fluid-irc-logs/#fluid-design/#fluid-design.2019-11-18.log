2019-11-18T21:44:04  <danayo_> greatislander, jhung: putting together this email to CoRise and wondering if you could provide some input into which of these tools might actually be feasible for us to work on? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rix3p1BULVdcuaE2Hu5Qqv76fV0Rk9BA9Qzfr2CF298/edit?usp=sharing
2019-11-18T21:45:10  <danayo_> was worried that if we ask them to suggest one it might be one that we can‚Äôt actually build
2019-11-18T21:45:29  <jhung> danayo_ I was just about to head offline. Can I take a look at this tomorrow morning?
2019-11-18T21:46:26  <danayo_> no worries jhung, we should probably send this email today as we have a meeting with them tomorrow, but we‚Äôll figure something out

2019-11-18T22:00:38  <danayo_> ok thanks greatislander
2019-11-18T22:00:49  <greatislander> This comment re: hub is interesting/complicating "Ideally would include package deals for providers rather than providers having to pay monthly fees for each tool"
2019-11-18T22:01:41  <greatislander> Not sure if I understand that‚Äî seems like a purchasing question rather than a technical one, i.e. the interest is in having the hub be the point of service and have the other tools be purchased by using the hub?

2019-11-18T22:57:28  <danayo_> is it fixed?
2019-11-18T22:57:37  <gmoss> I wasn't able to sign up for an account even though avtar gave me permission. I'm not sure if it is :(
2019-11-18T22:57:47  <gmoss> danayo_: fwiw, if any content disappears, we'll always have the previous version
2019-11-18T22:58:38  <danayo_> for sure gmoss. but were changes made to Netlify to try and fix it?
2019-11-18T23:00:02  <gmoss> danayo_: we found a bug with the way the "weight" field was set up (that's how the entries are ordered), and the fix for that has been merged in
2019-11-18T23:00:22  <danayo_> ok gmoss just realised the time and gotta walk the dog before dark! I‚Äôll try changing the link in Netlify when I get back
2019-11-18T23:00:24  <gmoss> so assuming that was the main issue, I would think it's solved, but I can't say for sure since I wasn't able to get in there and test it out
