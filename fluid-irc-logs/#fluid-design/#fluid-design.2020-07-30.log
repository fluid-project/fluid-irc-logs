2020-07-30T14:26:23  <cindyli> hi Teddy___, i guess you probably have read raunak's comments on github issues. he wants to contribute to we count project. looking thru our issues, the only one that's pure html/css is https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/256. i know you worked on it a couple of days ago. what's the progress? if there isn't much done, raunak probably can take over. if you are about to get it done, we can find him s
2020-07-30T14:26:24  <cindyli> omething else.
2020-07-30T14:28:00  <Teddy___> No theres still quite some work to be done. I have switched my focus to working on https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/350
2020-07-30T14:28:22  <Teddy___> raunak is free to help out by working on the hyphenate issue
2020-07-30T14:30:39  <cindyli> cool. Teddy___, can you update the ticket with steps to reproduce the problem?
2020-07-30T14:30:58  <Teddy___> Okay will do
2020-07-30T14:31:06  <cindyli> thanks
2020-07-30T14:57:21  <greatislander> cherylhjli michelled where shall we meet? just grabbing some water
2020-07-30T15:00:42  <cherylhjli> maybe we can use that spare room jon set up?
2020-07-30T15:00:50  <michelled> oh good idea, let's try it
2020-07-30T15:00:53  <greatislander> sure
2020-07-30T15:39:01  <danayo> colinclark: have you seen this? https://www.eyemole.io/
2020-07-30T15:39:17  <danayo> I like the How to start a co-op cartoon a lot
2020-07-30T16:24:44  * clown kicked out of the zoom meeting
2020-07-30T16:32:44  <danayo> gmoss, Justin_o, cindyli, michelled : just finished ligtening talk, can we start estimation meeting in 5?
2020-07-30T16:32:48  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: I'll need a few minutes before we jump into our estimation session
2020-07-30T16:32:51  <danayo> :D
2020-07-30T16:32:55  <gmoss> :)
2020-07-30T16:33:17  <gmoss> shall we say 12:40 EDT / 9:40 PT?
2020-07-30T16:33:22  <cindyli> sure
2020-07-30T16:33:39  <danayo> sure
2020-07-30T16:41:42  <gmoss> Sorry nearly ready, just switching computers
2020-07-30T16:52:30  <colinclark> I hear I was somehow responsible for causing your session to end today
2020-07-30T16:52:36  <colinclark> For the record, I hate Zoom
2020-07-30T16:52:38  <colinclark> and sorry about that
2020-07-30T16:53:01  <colinclark> is there some way we can make sure that there’s only one Host, who is actually able to stay for the duration of the meeting?
2020-07-30T16:53:17  <colinclark> I got an important Skype call I had to take about our new subaward with RtF-I, so bailed out early
2020-07-30T16:53:19  <colinclark> not sure how it happened
2020-07-30T16:53:28  <colinclark> Also, I have no donuts
2020-07-30T16:53:33  <colinclark> but how about some broccoli?
2020-07-30T16:53:35  <michelled> colinclark: the reason we made several people hosts was so people had the ability to kick out people if required
2020-07-30T16:53:45  <colinclark> I really don’t want to be a host :)
2020-07-30T16:54:06  <michelled> Justin_o: can you make colin not a host on the standup room?
2020-07-30T16:54:15  <colinclark> too much pressure
2020-07-30T16:54:23  <colinclark> :)
2020-07-30T16:54:26  <michelled> we can only make people who have full zoom accounts hosts
2020-07-30T16:54:34  <colinclark> that’s so idiotic
2020-07-30T16:54:38  <colinclark> i hate zoom
2020-07-30T16:54:42  <colinclark> or ocad’s zoom
2020-07-30T16:54:42  <michelled> so, as far as I know, me, justin, jon
2020-07-30T16:54:43  <colinclark> or whatever it is
2020-07-30T16:55:02  <michelled> if one of us joins, then we can assign someone else to be host
2020-07-30T16:55:30  <michelled> if there's anyone else with a full account who goes to the meetings, please speak up so we can get more folks able to handle moderation
2020-07-30T16:57:12  <colinclark> anyway, i’m really sorry for ending the meeting :)
2020-07-30T16:59:49  <colinclark> free broccoli for all, on me?
2020-07-30T17:10:25  <Justin_o> colinclark: no worries, if you encounter that situation again there is an option to-reassign host before leaving. I think this is a new security feature from zoom
2020-07-30T17:37:50  <gmoss> michelled: I have an account associated with my ocadu email address, I'm not sure what the distinction would be between that and a "full account". if that's sufficient, I don't mind being added to the mod list
2020-07-30T17:38:12  <gmoss> Justin_o ^
2020-07-30T17:39:29  <michelled> gmoss: are you able to create meetings that last longer than 40min?
2020-07-30T17:39:41  <michelled> that's the easiest way to tell
2020-07-30T17:39:45  <gmoss> michelled: I'll try it right now...
2020-07-30T17:39:58  * clown just finished lunch, but … broccoli?  yummmm
2020-07-30T17:40:25  <michelled> danielcho: let's check in please
2020-07-30T17:40:33  <danielcho> michelled: sure
2020-07-30T17:40:37  <danielcho> skype?
2020-07-30T17:40:40  <michelled> sure
2020-07-30T17:41:17  <gmoss> michelled, Justin_o (or others): if there was a 40-minute limit, would that be indicated somehow? I just made a meeting but I didn't see anything about a time limit
2020-07-30T17:43:27  <Justin_o> michelled: you mean right way on a zoom call.. I don't know for sure, but I think you might just get the notice a few minutes before your time expires.
2020-07-30T17:44:56  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you login to the zoom website you should be able to see what type of account you have. If it's a pro account you can be added as co-host to the meeting.
2020-07-30T17:45:37  <gmoss> Justin_o: "User Type: Basic"
2020-07-30T17:45:43  <gmoss> looks like I'm not host material :( haha
2020-07-30T17:46:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: :) you can still be made a host in the meeting
2020-07-30T17:59:34  <Justin_o> gmoss and cindyli: can you confirm that this is the last merge into master before the last release. I want to tag it as v0.8.0
2020-07-30T17:59:35  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/commit/9d75ec1a99cfce50e65c9e6d95c0e2a45f005654
2020-07-30T18:01:33  <Justin_o> gmoss: actually never mind, we can't tag that as v0.8.0.. the package.json file lists the version as 0.2.0
2020-07-30T18:01:44  <gmoss> Justin_o: oh, well then
2020-07-30T18:02:03  <Justin_o> gmoss: so we could release that as 0.2.0 or just not tag it at all
2020-07-30T18:02:15  <gmoss> 0.8.0 was an arbitrary starting point anyway, so I'm fine with 0.2.0. SJRK-289 will be a "major" change anyway, I think
2020-07-30T18:02:23  <Justin_o> gmoss, cindyli: should we get in a quick version bump for this release to 0.9.0?
2020-07-30T18:03:08  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm fine with that, or 0.3.0
2020-07-30T18:03:21  <gmoss> I don't have a preference
2020-07-30T18:03:32  <Justin_o> gmoss: I don't either.. cindyli any thoughts?
2020-07-30T18:05:02  <cindyli> fine with me too
2020-07-30T18:05:26  <gmoss> Justin_o: btw yes, I believe `9d75ec1` is the last commit that was deployed, it's the latest commit other than the merge from master in each of the production branches
2020-07-30T18:06:04  <cindyli> Justin_o, gmoss, where's the version? don't see it in github
2020-07-30T18:06:16  <gmoss> cindyli: I believe it's in the package.json
2020-07-30T18:06:39  <gmoss> (brb)
2020-07-30T18:07:19  <Justin_o> cindyli: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/9d75ec1a99cfce50e65c9e6d95c0e2a45f005654/package.json#L3
2020-07-30T18:07:26  <cindyli> gmoss: thanks. see it. it seems more reasonable to bump to 0.3.0. Justin_o, is there a reason you suggest 0.9.0
2020-07-30T18:07:48  <Justin_o> cindyli: we talked about that before because the next one will be 1.0.0
2020-07-30T18:07:53  <cindyli> i also wonder if we should tag a github release to map what's in package.json
2020-07-30T18:07:58  <Justin_o> so that's the only reason, so in general it doesn't matter I think
2020-07-30T18:08:14  <cindyli> i see.
2020-07-30T18:08:24  <Justin_o> cindyli: you mean this release, or the previous one.. I was going to go back and tag the last release as well
2020-07-30T18:08:42  <Justin_o> if we do that, I'll need to bump our current release to 0.3.0 or whatever in the package.json
2020-07-30T18:08:44  <cindyli> Justin_o: it would be great to tag all releases
2020-07-30T18:09:17  <Justin_o> cindyli: I don't think we can go prior to the previous release, it would depend on when the package.json was updated. Assuming we want to keep those in sync
2020-07-30T18:09:44  <cindyli> agree
2020-07-30T18:11:06  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, so I'll tag the previous release as 0.2.0 and I'll submit a PR to update the current package version to 0.3.0
2020-07-30T18:11:09  <Justin_o> sound okay?
2020-07-30T18:11:32  <cindyli> sounds good to me
2020-07-30T18:12:19  <cindyli> Justin_o, gmoss: just fyi, wecount uses a npm package "release" to do these updates - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/package.json#L52
2020-07-30T18:12:37  <cindyli> it includes tag the branch, update package.json etc
2020-07-30T18:14:00  <cindyli> it would be good to update CONTRIBUTING.md to explain the release process
2020-07-30T18:14:16  <cindyli> no matter which approach we take
2020-07-30T18:15:18  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for sharing, I was also looking at https://www.npmjs.com/package/np before as well
2020-07-30T18:15:53  <Justin_o> I'll tag the previous release manually and look into one of these as an option for this release.
2020-07-30T18:16:05  <gmoss> cindyli: that's a pretty neat package, I don't recall seeing it before. seems quite helpful! in the meantime, I agree with Justin_o's plan to tag the current production version as 0.2.0 in GitHub, then hopefully we can squeeze in a quick update to set the package.json version to 0.3.0 in `master` which will then be pushed out to production branches when we deploy tomorroiw
2020-07-30T18:16:05  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2020-07-30T18:16:29  <cindyli> agree, gmoss
2020-07-30T18:17:21  <Justin_o> cindyli, gmoss: any preference for v0.2.0 vs 0.2.0 for the tag name?
2020-07-30T18:17:32  <gmoss> hmm
2020-07-30T18:18:05  <gmoss> Justin_o: what would it affect, beyond sort order in the case that we have any other kinds of tag?
2020-07-30T18:18:21  <gmoss> do we want other kinds of tag to show up before or after these regularly tagged releases?
2020-07-30T18:18:38  <cindyli> i prefer 0.2.0
2020-07-30T18:18:40  <gmoss> I think I'm leaning towards "0.2.0"
2020-07-30T18:18:54  <Justin_o> I think the automatic tools will also not use the "v" prefix so lets just go with that
2020-07-30T18:19:07  <gmoss> perfect :)
2020-07-30T18:19:19  <cindyli> umm.. Justin_o: "release" doesn't seem to include "v" prefix
2020-07-30T18:19:31  <cindyli> https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/commit/8ebb47159186da6671abbf33e933be5d9c0b281e
2020-07-30T18:19:51  <cindyli> this is tagged by "release"
2020-07-30T18:20:07  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. I'll leave the "v" off
2020-07-30T18:23:57  <Justin_o> gmoss: here's the release page for 0.2.0 tagged release. https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/releases/tag/0.2.0
2020-07-30T18:24:12  <Justin_o> gmoss: let me know if you have anything we should add to the description
2020-07-30T18:25:05  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome, thanks! I'll think about what we could add there..
2020-07-30T18:25:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks.. for this next one we should include a change log in the description, which shouldn't be too much I think
2020-07-30T18:26:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: agreed. I think that log should mention what Jiras have been addressed, maybe link to those
2020-07-30T18:26:57  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm going to put my head down and start the testing, will report back when I'm all done :)
2020-07-30T18:30:49  <Justin_o> cindyli: I'm going to file a JIRA about adding the automated release tool. There are quite a few out there so it will take a bit of time to decide on one to use.
2020-07-30T18:32:44  <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please merge this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/93
2020-07-30T18:36:32  <Justin_o> cindyli, gmoss: I've filed the new issue to add release tooling at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-382
2020-07-30T18:48:31  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. the pull request is merged
2020-07-30T18:48:42  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2020-07-30T18:48:50  <Justin_o> gmoss, cindyli: when is the staging server updated?
2020-07-30T18:49:29  <gmoss> Justin_o: any commits to `master` trigger a deployment to the staging server
2020-07-30T18:49:53  <gmoss> to the upstream master, that is
2020-07-30T18:50:03  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, so we should have the latest version on the staging site in a couple minutes?
2020-07-30T18:50:27  <gmoss> Justin_o: has there been a change since the SJRK-370 PR was merged?
2020-07-30T18:50:31  <Justin_o> gmoss: also I was running the tests just now on Safari and they are stalling when running from the staging site, but running fine from the server started on my machine locally.
2020-07-30T18:50:35  <gmoss> nm I see it now :)_
2020-07-30T18:50:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: yah, cindyli just merged the version number change
2020-07-30T18:50:48  <gmoss> Justin_o: was it the Page grade tests?
2020-07-30T18:51:07  <Justin_o> gmoss: base-page-Tests.html
2020-07-30T18:51:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's a known issue: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-372
2020-07-30T18:51:30  <gmoss> (I think it's #1 on the list from the last round of tests)
2020-07-30T18:51:35  <Justin_o> lol it is the first one
2020-07-30T18:51:46  <Justin_o> I thought I broke something.. I wonder why it works locally
2020-07-30T18:51:53  <gmoss> yeah it's interesting!
2020-07-30T18:52:10  <gmoss> maybe the latency becomes a factor and exposes a race conditioon
2020-07-30T18:54:12  <Justin_o> possibly.. or it just takes long enough for that resource that it times out the test.. it's a wonder.
2020-07-30T18:54:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: once SJRK-122 goes in we might want to check with gtirloni about deploying the browser and manual tests like we do for Infusion.
2020-07-30T18:55:27  <Justin_o> or if the config needs to happen in the repo, maybe along with the PR
2020-07-30T18:57:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'll need to familiarize myself with how infusion tests are deployed currently, I don't remember at the moment
2020-07-30T18:58:08  <gmoss> do you mean including them as part of CI/CD?
2020-07-30T18:58:10  <Justin_o> gmoss: basically infusion is built and deployed on a web server, so we can access the demos and tests.
2020-07-30T18:58:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: ah, so we'd have a separate URL to access a publicly-available version of the browser and manual tests?
2020-07-30T18:58:44  <Justin_o> gmoss: the tests will run as part Ci with the SJRK-122 work. That part is happening in my PR already actually.
2020-07-30T18:58:47  <gmoss> not connected to DB
2020-07-30T18:58:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: yep that's right
2020-07-30T18:59:00  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, I like that idea
2020-07-30T18:59:22  <gmoss> and it satisfies the spirit of SJRK-300
2020-07-30T19:00:27  <Justin_o> cool
2020-07-30T19:04:40  <cindyli> Teddy___: the check in is starting now
2020-07-30T19:06:48  <cindyli> colinclark: are you coming to today's we count meeting? it's starting now.
2020-07-30T19:07:06  <colinclark> i am going to try to join soon, cindyli
2020-07-30T19:07:10  <colinclark> i’m stuck in another meeting
2020-07-30T19:07:15  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2020-07-30T19:07:17  <colinclark> philip managed to get out of it, but i did not
