2020-10-06T13:50:24  <greatislander> morning, cindyli! have you run into any issues similar to the one gtirloni reported on the IDRC site with the We Count site? I think you are also using `eleventy-plugin-pwa`, yes?
2020-10-06T13:55:24  <cindyli> yes, greatislander, i use firefox as the default browser and it doesn't have a convenient tool as chrome for developers to bypass the service worker. the problem gtirloni had occurs in firefox. what i do is to clear the local storage. but i didn't find the solution to programmatically force the service worker to reload, which i think is reasonable as service workers are designed for offline caching
2020-10-06T13:58:24  <greatislander> thanks, cindyli. What I want to try to do is find a way to have the service worker detect if there's been an update to those files and load them directly from the network if so, otherwise load from cache. That way if we've deployed a new version of the website it will load immediately for all users and then load more quickly (from cache) on subsequent visits
2020-10-06T13:59:26  <cindyli> make sense
2020-10-06T15:30:49  <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning will start soon
2020-10-06T15:33:13  <greatislander> FYI the link in the calendar doesn't have the password but if you use the connection meeting link for yesterday it is the same room with the password!

2020-10-06T15:41:11  <Uttara> fluid-everyone: can someone share the room password
2020-10-06T15:42:07  <sbates> Uttara: the link on the calendar has been updated and now includes the password
2020-10-06T16:32:08  <gmoss> danayo Justin_o: shall we meet for ST check-in?
2020-10-06T16:32:18  <danayo> yep
2020-10-06T17:24:09  <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo: do you have a link to the Part2 activity worksheet for tomorrow?
2020-10-06T17:30:23  <danayo> I think so sepidehshahi, one sec
2020-10-06T17:30:32  <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo
2020-10-06T17:31:06  <colinclark> cherylhjli, sepidehshahi, greatislander: Should we check in sometime later today or tomorrow to talk about how we want to start orienting people to our co-design practices in Accessibility in Action?
2020-10-06T17:32:38  <sepidehshahi> colinclark: I’m available 2-3 today. Tomorrow I have to WeCount workshop

2020-10-06T17:35:31  <danayo> sepidehshahi: I think I just sent you a link to a folder by email :)
2020-10-06T17:35:44  <danayo> I’m not very familiar with Sharepoint
2020-10-06T17:35:50  <danayo> let me know if that worked
2020-10-06T17:35:55  <greatislander> i'm good for 2pm colinclark sepidehshahi

2020-10-06T17:39:45  <colinclark> i’ll set up a zoom url
2020-10-06T17:41:32  <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo! it worked :)
2020-10-06T17:41:41  <danayo> hooray
2020-10-06T17:58:10  <colinclark> cherylhjli, sepidehshahi, greatislander: For our meeting in two minutes, https://ocadu.zoom.us/j/83509393095
2020-10-06T19:34:11  <danayo> Justin_o: mockups of Story Tool Log in / Sign up https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/nCHcHDWmWPDqNJf
2020-10-06T19:34:21  <danayo> I added the link to our spreadsheet as well
2020-10-06T19:34:43  <danayo> Let me know if you have any questions / thoughts and if you want to talk through them at some point
2020-10-06T19:35:27  <danayo> I should really say let me know WHEN you have any questions/thought :)
2020-10-06T19:36:08  <Justin_o> danayo: I'll take a look at it, thanks for sharing
2020-10-06T19:37:49  <Justin_o> danayo: just did a quick skim, do you have mockups for an interface to view your published  or in progress stories?
2020-10-06T19:38:00  <Justin_o> so that you'll be able to edit/delete them?
2020-10-06T19:38:30  <danayo> Justin_o: not yet - theres a note in there, “to be mocked up” :)
2020-10-06T19:38:42  <danayo> That’s next
2020-10-06T19:39:08  <danayo> I had imagined a couple of options
2020-10-06T19:39:24  <danayo> that stories authored by you appear editable/deleteable from the Browse page
2020-10-06T19:39:34  <danayo> but also (or alternatively) there is a Manage my Stories page
2020-10-06T19:39:48  <danayo> I think both would be nice to have
2020-10-06T19:42:27  <Justin_o> danayo: yes, sounds like good options..
2020-10-06T19:44:33  <gmoss> danayo Justin_o: I recall one of the more recent times we discussed this, we thought it might be easier (at least initially) to implement edit and delete buttons on the browse page for stories the current user is the author of, rather than a standalone "manage my stories" page
2020-10-06T19:44:35  <Justin_o> danayo: actually that reminds me.. gmoss, cindyli and myself also talked a bit about the  differences between environments that have authoring enabled vs disabled. So we may want to consider how the designs/interactions will differ in the two cases. More longer term we were discussing having the authoring disabled case just output a fully static site. However, at any rate we'll need to be able to modify the UI to
2020-10-06T19:44:35  <Justin_o> not have anything that requires a login I guess.
2020-10-06T19:45:42  <danayo> yes I recall that too gmoss
2020-10-06T19:46:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: a good point! I was also thinking last night (and this is something I believe we discussed in 2017(!)) that it might be neat to have published stories immediately build to static files rather than serving them dynamically every time. we would still want them in the DB for editing purposes. This would really only work if the build can be done incrementally, it would be too resource-intensive to build all
2020-10-06T19:46:28  <gmoss> stories any time a new one was added or edited
2020-10-06T19:47:04  <gmoss> the original version of this idea was to use GH pages to serve stories, iirc
2020-10-06T19:49:01  <Justin_o> gmoss: I was talking with cindyli about incremental (diff builds) the other day related to this and the wecount site.. if we could do that it might make sense. But yes, at the moment if we need to rebuild all stories all the time, it'll just be too much of a burden.
2020-10-06T19:49:13  <danayo> Justin_o, gmoss maybe we can discuss at tomorrow’s checkin? I’m not sure exactly what you mean about designs for authoring disabled case
2020-10-06T19:50:11  <gmoss> danayo: definitely!
2020-10-06T19:50:21  <Justin_o> danayo: sure, we can talk more tomorrow.. as a quick summary, when you disable authoring, you won't be able to edit any of the stories. And if we move to static site you won't be able to login and etc.
2020-10-06T19:51:44  <danayo> thanks Justin_o. And I guess teh Story Tool wouldn’t be available at all
2020-10-06T19:51:48  <danayo> ?
2020-10-06T19:53:02  <Justin_o> the editing, no.. you would still be able to browse and view stories though
2020-10-06T19:54:03  <danayo> yes
