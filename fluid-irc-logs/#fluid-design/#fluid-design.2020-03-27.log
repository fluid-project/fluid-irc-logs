2020-03-27T15:50:32  <cherylhjli> yep greatislander
2020-03-27T15:50:43  <michelled> I have a meeting at noon

2020-03-27T15:54:24  <erictheise> I’ve got a narrow window in which to get groceries this morning so I can’t make standup if we’re having one.
2020-03-27T15:54:25  <michelled> actually my meeting got pushed 15 minutes so I can join for a bit
2020-03-27T15:54:35  <cherylhjli> no worries erictheise
2020-03-27T15:54:57  <erictheise> I assume Trebor’s email is about the Directory and not the Library and I can answer his question when I return in a few hours.

2020-03-27T15:56:56  <gmoss> cindyli: during standup you asked about whether we would talk about storytelling tool things. I'd like to get my ducks a bit more in a row at this point, namely a little bit of work prepping some CI jobs and the branch pull requests, then I plan to send an email to you, alanharnum, and michelled to go over the PRs, laying out my plan for deploying this work :)
2020-03-27T15:57:39  <cindyli> sounds great. thanks for letting me know, gmoss

2020-03-27T16:08:12  <colinclark> philip: There was something that rankled me a bit about your assertion that the “demos worked by accident” at standup today
2020-03-27T16:08:47  <michelled> cherylhjli: do you have a link to the resource library mockups?
2020-03-27T16:08:58  <philip> Yeah, it's a careless phrase. I've just been talking to simonjb about it
2020-03-27T16:09:39  <colinclark> ah, i don’t see the logs for that
2020-03-27T16:10:26  <colinclark> anyway, I think there’s a certain historicity that is helpful when working with code like this, which depends on a framework that is constantly changing, evolving
2020-03-27T16:11:54  <simonjb> colinclark: it was in a private chat
2020-03-27T16:12:09  <colinclark> nice
2020-03-27T16:12:18  <colinclark> there’s a lot of that going on with the Nexus these days
2020-03-27T16:12:24  <philip> That's a good way of putting it. My sense is that the now-misbehaving code is completely Infusion-appropriate, but over time has not been recaptured as constituting a "blessed technique"
2020-03-27T16:12:38  <colinclark> what do startups call it
2020-03-27T16:12:41  <colinclark> submarine mode or something
2020-03-27T16:13:16  <colinclark> The priestliness of this is so boring
2020-03-27T16:13:27  <colinclark> “Blessed” anything
2020-03-27T16:13:53  <philip> Sorry for the rude phrasing, simonjb in particular
2020-03-27T16:15:13  <philip> I do feel a little stuck in a web of dependencies, but it's not really anyone's fault
2020-03-27T16:15:26  <colinclark> Welcome to JavaScript
2020-03-27T16:16:04  <philip> Worldly programming
2020-03-27T16:18:59  <colinclark> If it wasn’t clear by my earlier comments, I’m very uncomfortable with this concept of “blessed technique”
2020-03-27T16:19:25  <colinclark> it doesn’t feel like the sort of perspective an inclusive design community would foster
2020-03-27T16:19:40  <colinclark> that classic doctor who quote comes to mind
2020-03-27T16:19:59  <colinclark> “Are you a doctor of law? Of Philosophy?”
2020-03-27T16:20:14  <colinclark> “Which laws?! Whose philophoshy?!"
2020-03-27T16:20:56  <philip> I agree, but I also wonder if to some extent that development is unavoidable when people are working with an evolving tool
2020-03-27T16:20:59  *** jhung <jhung!~jhung@CPE0c473dc371c3-CM0c473dc371c0.cpe.net.fido.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2020-03-27T16:21:36  <philip> The tool's continued design is informed by what people do with it, but then there are also purposeful or unintentional decisions that exclude some patterns of use
2020-03-27T16:23:52  <colinclark> Precisely why the metaphor may not be apt
2020-03-27T16:24:16  <philip> This smells like a failure of "ownability" and "materiality" in terms of some papers we are familiar with
2020-03-27T16:34:23  <cherylhjli> hey michelled, my mockups don't have the latest visual designs but I believe greatislander has incorporated them into the staging site already
2020-03-27T16:36:18  <michelled> cherylhjli: cool, yeah, I *love* how that site looks :)
2020-03-27T16:36:51  <michelled> cherylhjli: just to clarify, was the visual design communicated on github? It's not super important - I'm just curious
2020-03-27T16:36:57  <cherylhjli> me too!! I love dana's illustrations
2020-03-27T16:37:12  <cherylhjli> umm I think there might've been a few github issues to incorporate them, and some to add alterations
2020-03-27T16:39:22  <michelled> cool, thx
2020-03-27T16:40:38  <colinclark> so greatislander, cherylhjli, Jutta’s response was “Ignore it and I will deal with it next week. In the list of demands, it doesn’t deserve priority.”
2020-03-27T16:40:54  <cherylhjli> sounds good, thanks colinclark
2020-03-27T16:40:54  <colinclark> so I think we’re all on the same page here :)
2020-03-27T16:40:58  <cherylhjli> awesome
2020-03-27T16:42:48  <colinclark> philip: In terms of the issue of Flocking not working with more recent development builds of Infusion, I’ll do my best to finish those fixes asap
2020-03-27T16:42:54  <colinclark> hopefully this afternoon if all goes well
2020-03-27T16:43:42  <colinclark> I’d recommend just moving on to something else in the meantime
2020-03-27T16:45:45  <philip> Awesome to hear, colinclark
