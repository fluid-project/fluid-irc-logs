2019-12-18T19:54:14  <michelled> just under Dash for now sepidehshahi -
2019-12-18T19:54:26  <michelled> when we add other robot support we can put our activities in general

2019-12-18T21:37:27  <michelled> but maybe it was when I switched focus?
2019-12-18T21:37:32  <michelled> I didn't test it closely
2019-12-18T21:37:35  <danielcho> oh yeah, probably
