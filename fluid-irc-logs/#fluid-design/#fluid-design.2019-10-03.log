2019-10-03T17:00:58  <michelled> danielcho: my current meeting is running a bit longer than I expected
2019-10-03T17:01:05  <michelled> can I ping you when it's done?
2019-10-03T17:01:41  <danielcho> oh okay, sure, we are all gathered together at the table at the back, so just let me know when your meeting is over

2019-10-03T18:15:55  <gmoss> I thought it might be a quick fix, clearly it's much more complicated than that :)

2019-10-03T19:00:07  <gmoss> I'm noticing bugs in the example code
2019-10-03T19:00:20  <gmoss> but I'm not sure if it's the code or an issue with my environment

2019-10-03T19:02:51  <gmoss> greatislander: if you have any insight on the above, it would be great to know :) I don't know if you completed this course using WSL and VSCode, though
2019-10-03T19:05:40  <jhung> gmoss I haven't done that LinkedIn Learning course. If you have debugging on, is there any output?
2019-10-03T19:06:32  <greatislander> Hey gmoss, I haven’t done it either. I am on VS Code too, but on Mac. Might be able to help if you send me any debugging info!
2019-10-03T19:06:35  <gmoss> jhung: there is. it's a null ref error, there's supposed to be a particular named image size added on image upload, but it's not being defined
2019-10-03T19:06:46  <gmoss> greatislander: ^
2019-10-03T19:07:25  <gmoss> I think I'll pore over the WP docs for the add_image_size function, just to make sure it hasn't changed since this course code was created
2019-10-03T19:07:38  <gmoss> I wanted to see if either of you had encountered this before :)
