2020-04-23T21:54:52  <Teddy___> greatislander: cindyli: Is there a definitive way to know if the site is running completely statically or not?
2020-04-23T21:55:08  <greatislander> that's a good question, and I don't know the answer.
2020-04-23T21:55:33  <Teddy___> aha I'll keep look
2020-04-23T21:55:38  <Teddy___> looking*
2020-04-23T21:55:52  <Teddy___> what was that tool that you used to asses the size of  jsdom
2020-04-23T21:56:15  <Teddy___> greatislander: the one that let you know it was using 4mb
2020-04-23T21:56:38  <Teddy___> looked like some sort of browser extention
2020-04-23T21:56:39  <greatislander> I looked at the console when running build
2020-04-23T21:56:40  <greatislander> or dev
2020-04-23T21:56:46  <Teddy___> okay
2020-04-23T21:56:50  <greatislander> Oh, that was the network tools in dev tools
2020-04-23T21:56:59  <greatislander> If you load the page it'll show you how big everything is
