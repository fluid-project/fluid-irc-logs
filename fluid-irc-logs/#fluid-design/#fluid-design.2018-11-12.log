2018-11-12T20:24:17  <jhung> fluid-everyone: sorry for the late query, but does anyone have a topic for tomorrow's design crit?
2018-11-12T20:24:41  <sepidehshahi> I don’t jhung
2018-11-12T20:25:26  <michelled> jhung: we didn't get to the platform coop site last week - were we planning to do it this week?
2018-11-12T20:26:01  <danayo_> jhung, michelled: I think I’d like to hold off on the platform coop site crit until Avtar is here
2018-11-12T20:26:13  <michelled> oh right, makes sense
2018-11-12T20:26:16  <danayo_> I guess that means waiting until we’re back
2018-11-12T20:26:25  <danayo_> Dec 4
2018-11-12T20:26:41  <danayo_> perhaps we can put that in the schedule jhung?
2018-11-12T20:27:11  <danayo_> in that case I don’t have anything for tomorrow jhung
2018-11-12T20:28:23  <danayo_> by that time Avtar might have some sketches we could talk about too
2018-11-12T20:29:52  <jhung> ok. So there's nothing tomorrow danayo. I'll put in platform co-op on Dec 4.

2018-11-12T20:33:01  <jhung> michelled: I got an email from Vera about the IDRC site. She wants to send Heidiv the designs. But I wonder if it's a good idea to update the design a little first?
2018-11-12T20:33:12  <danayo_> thanks jhung
2018-11-12T20:33:47  <jhung> maybe that can be the crit tomorrow? The IDRC site.
2018-11-12T20:35:17  <michelled> jhung: interesting - yes, I think we said that for sure we needed to update the designs because we need to focus on resources
2018-11-12T20:35:30  <michelled> that's been on Jutta's mind for a long time
2018-11-12T20:35:54  <michelled> the Floe site resources are standing in for now, but she wants the IDRC page to have a cohesive set
2018-11-12T20:36:15  <michelled> jhung, do you know if heidi was going to be doing some design as well?
2018-11-12T20:36:24  <jhung> Perfect michelled. Could you and I pair on facilitating the crit tomorrow?
2018-11-12T20:36:32  <michelled> yep!
2018-11-12T20:37:24  <jhung> michelled: I don't know. I was under the impression Heidi was going to help build, but I don't think I should assume that. Maybe there's time / resources for design as well
2018-11-12T20:41:50  <michelled> ok, well, regardless a crit seems timely :)
2018-11-12T20:45:10  <michelled> jhung: lisa isn't able to make it to the crit tomorrow and those are her designs, right? it feels weird to have a crit on them without her
2018-11-12T20:46:41  <michelled> jhung, maybe we should move the crit time this week so it works for her
2018-11-12T20:46:46  <jhung> michelled: Maybe if it's just information gathering then and not specific to the designs?
2018-11-12T20:47:52  <jhung> If we want to move it, when would be a good day and time michelled?
2018-11-12T20:51:55  <michelled> jhung: how about Wednesday before the community meeting?
2018-11-12T20:52:51  <jhung> michelled: so 1:30p to 2:30p?
2018-11-12T20:52:55  <michelled> yeah
2018-11-12T20:53:17  <jhung> ok I'll send a follow-up
