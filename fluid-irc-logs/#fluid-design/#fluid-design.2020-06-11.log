2020-06-11T19:05:04  <danayo> greatislander, cherylhjli, jhung - I made some notes during our PC meeting (I’ll add these to the project folder, we didn’t have an agenda set up today), there are a couple of things we should check in about at some point https://docs.google.com/document/d/17KJqPh9v9LnPi9-I6z2UCcmcjcACK3cm4J996yvKlF8/edit?usp=sharing
2020-06-11T19:58:03  <greatislander> hi jhung, around now if you are free
2020-06-11T20:03:14  <jhung> greatislander It's ok. Justin_o helped me figure it out.
2020-06-11T20:04:50  <greatislander> okay cool
2020-06-11T20:52:31  <michelled> Teddy___: can we try for 2:00 pm eastern to do the tasking we talked about?
2020-06-11T20:52:37  <michelled> on Monday that is :D
2020-06-11T21:06:59  <Teddy___> Okay, Monday works
2020-06-11T21:07:12  <Teddy___> see you then michelled
2020-06-11T21:21:22  <greatislander> hi erictheise, I'm finishing up the organization flow and this issue is outstanding, which is preventing the Geographic Scope field from being saved. Do you have any preferences as to how to address it? https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/issues/64
2020-06-11T21:21:31  <greatislander> thanks in advance.
2020-06-11T21:30:28  <erictheise> greatislander it’s fresher in your mind than mine so I’d say bring the choices in line with what you’ve done in other more recently added fields.
2020-06-11T21:36:30  <greatislander> okay. I'll check and see if there are any records with geo_scope. My guess is there aren't. Will open a specific PR for this.
2020-06-11T21:36:34  <greatislander> thanks erictheise
2020-06-11T21:37:37  <erictheise> greatislander there are dozens having a value.
2020-06-11T21:37:50  <greatislander> ok.
2020-06-11T21:45:07  <greatislander> doesn't appear that any have a value at least in my local copy of the database. I haven't pulled from the demo site in the last couple of days. happy to be corrected if I'm missing something erictheise
2020-06-11T21:47:14  <greatislander> (tested by running this in the shell: `Organization.objects.filter(geo_scope__gte=0)`
2020-06-11T21:47:17  <greatislander> )
2020-06-11T21:50:14  <greatislander> in any case, I'm wrapping up my work for the moment, but i'll be back at it tomorrow.
2020-06-11T21:52:08  <erictheise> I’ll dig into it tonight greatislander, not sure what’s going on there.
