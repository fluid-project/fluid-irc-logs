2019-08-09T14:36:02  <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I saw your email came through, did you figure out what the problem was, or did it just work today?
2019-08-09T14:37:42  <sepidehshahi> hi alanharnum, I just used my computer at home to send out the email. I think you were right, there is some sort of problem related to privacy certificates at my work computer that blocks my emails to community list. I’ll ask Bert to look into it next week.

2019-08-09T14:39:06  <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: yeah, I suspect something in the chain is swallowing the email due to the self-signed certificate - I didn't see an obvious issue with Mailman or SpamHero, but I didn't dig into the server logs, etc.

2019-08-09T14:40:22  <sepidehshahi> Thanks alanharnum for your help. For now we are good and hopefully Bert can fix the issue next week :)
2019-08-09T14:42:36  <sepidehshahi> Hi colinclark, kendraf crystalchan and I have made some changes to the blog posts. can you please send us a link to the github repo, so we can make a pull request? thanks
2019-08-09T14:43:06  <colinclark> hi sepidehshahi
2019-08-09T14:43:17  <colinclark> As far as I know, Avtar put the blog pages here: https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-website/tree/master/content/blog
2019-08-09T14:43:21  <colinclark> in the website repository
2019-08-09T14:44:14  <sepidehshahi> perfect! thanks colinclark
2019-08-09T14:54:10  <colinclark> cherylhjli: Wow, related to our conversation yesterday, I was quite wrong…
2019-08-09T14:54:18  <colinclark> Apparently Uber lost $5 billion last quarter
2019-08-09T14:54:26  <colinclark> not just half a billion like they used to lose :)
2019-08-09T14:54:37  <cherylhjli> WOW
2019-08-09T14:54:42  <cherylhjli> how are they still standing?
2019-08-09T14:54:43  <cherylhjli> that's wild

2019-08-09T15:12:25  <colinclark> so one wonders how long this will all last
2019-08-09T15:12:56  <alanharnum> interesting, looks like 4 billion of that is stock-based compenstation payouts
