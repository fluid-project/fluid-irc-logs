2019-12-10T17:58:46  <simonjb> hi sepidehshahi, thanks for the updated SVGs -- the Add_NoBackgroud.svg has a <style> element with a class, would you be able to export with the "inline" CSS setting please?
2019-12-10T17:58:51  <simonjb> danielcho ^
2019-12-10T17:59:49  <simonjb> there's a small difference in the size, but that is easy to change on our side (18 vs 18.27)
2019-12-10T17:59:52  <sepidehshahi> sorry I forgot. sure
2019-12-10T17:59:56  <simonjb> thanks sepidehshahi
2019-12-10T18:02:02  <simonjb> the size difference is only 1.5% so it's probably not noticable
2019-12-10T18:06:16  <danielcho> thanks sepidehshahi :)
2019-12-10T18:06:23  <danielcho> simonjb: should I change 18 to 18.27?
2019-12-10T18:07:09  <danielcho> not noticeable at all
2019-12-10T18:07:12  <simonjb> danielcho: let's leave at 18
2019-12-10T18:07:20  <danielcho> ok
2019-12-10T18:07:29  <simonjb> not noticeable at 18 or 18.27?
2019-12-10T18:07:45  <danielcho> I tried with 18.27
2019-12-10T18:08:02  <danielcho> and I don't see any noticeable changes from 18
2019-12-10T18:08:03  <simonjb> that will add a little padding to the right hand side
2019-12-10T18:08:09  <danielcho> ah
2019-12-10T18:08:17  <simonjb> ok, let's leave at 18 for now
2019-12-10T18:08:27  <danielcho> will do :)
2019-12-10T18:08:31  <simonjb> thanks!

2019-12-10T18:34:30  <avtar> danielcho: specifically that todo item for now ^
2019-12-10T18:35:04  <avtar> depending on the activity we may need some assets like a physical map
2019-12-10T18:35:44  <avtar> so knowing how far dash will travel for each movement block will help in knowing the size of paper required
2019-12-10T18:36:03  <danielcho> ah, I think Simon knows how to control that
2019-12-10T18:37:24  <danielcho> but for now, I can measure how far Dash moves on forward?
2019-12-10T18:38:29  <avtar> that would be great
2019-12-10T18:38:34  <avtar> danielcho, sepidehshahi ^
2019-12-10T18:39:37  <danielcho> I can do that tomorrow since I am wfh today, or maybe Simon can help when he comes back from the appointment

2019-12-10T20:34:48  <gmoss> michelled danayo: should we meet about the Storytelling Tool? I'm still working through SJRK-255 so I don't have much to add re the other issues on the Task List. it also seems michelled is still in a call (which is fine, of course)
2019-12-10T20:36:27  <danayo> gmoss: I donâ€™t have anything to update or discuss at this point so maybe makes sense to meet later
2019-12-10T20:36:44  <gmoss> danayo: okay, thanks! that seems like the most reasonable choice
2019-12-10T20:36:45  <gmoss> :)
2019-12-10T20:38:45  <michelled> sorry gmoss - maybe 1/2 an hour isn't quite enough!
2019-12-10T20:38:57  <gmoss> michelled: no worries at all :)
2019-12-10T20:39:25  <michelled> gmoss: we can just check in here :) in terms of SJRK-255 - hows that going? I saw you talking to justin and antranig
2019-12-10T20:39:37  <michelled> are you good or are there things that you're stuck with?
2019-12-10T20:40:37  <gmoss> michelled: yep! so Bosmon and I chatted yesterday about my options merging issue, he filed GPII-4259 as I mentioned at planning today, and I implemented an override of the mergePolicy to get around it until that Jira is dealt with. I'm now working on fixing UIO multilingual things since options are now immutable and that all broke
2019-12-10T20:41:06  <gmoss> michelled: Justin_o has been helping me out with that, and while I wouldn't say I'm stuck it is a little challenging :)
2019-12-10T20:41:07  <michelled> oh, right!
2019-12-10T20:41:34  <michelled> Justin_o: I wonder if it's worth writing up some docs as you help gmoss with that - sounds like something lots of people will hit
2019-12-10T20:42:11  <gmoss> michelled: the work is mainly a matter of converting options distributions blocks and turn them into model relays where applicable, and cutting out now-obsolete bits
2019-12-10T20:43:09  <michelled> cool! sounds like progress
