2018-10-01T15:46:55  <jhung> michelled: I thought there was going to be a combination of talks and videos? Maybe I misunderstood.
2018-10-01T15:47:19  <michelled> I thought vera said there would be no place for talks?
2018-10-01T15:47:29  <michelled> because of needing to set the room up in a particular way
2018-10-01T15:47:52  <michelled> and then there was conversation about having the talks in the black box theatre which we felt would mean talking to an empty room
2018-10-01T15:47:59  <michelled> and then we came up with the idea of the videos
2018-10-01T15:48:19  <michelled> anyway, I don't want Avtar and I to spend a bunch of time making this compilation if that's not the plan :)
2018-10-01T15:50:00  <jhung> I'll email Vera and Jess to get clarification.
2018-10-01T15:50:09  <michelled> great! maybe cc the everyone list?
2018-10-01T15:50:12  <michelled> thank you!

2018-10-01T21:04:26  <gmoss> michelled: I was about to share the GSoC article with my students, but I noticed the link on the FLOE news page has a typo: https://floeproject.org/news/2018-09-17-GSoc2018.html should be https://floeproject.org/news/2018-09-17-GSoC2018.html

2018-10-01T21:07:14  <gmoss> I also noticed that Spifind isn't hosted yet, I guess we never sorted that out
2018-10-01T21:07:27  <michelled> no, and we aren't going to spend time trying to do that right now
2018-10-01T21:07:53  <gmoss> michelled: maybe it depends on the hosting system. iirc some servers are case-sensitive while others are not
