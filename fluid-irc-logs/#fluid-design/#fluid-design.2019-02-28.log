2019-02-28T18:25:59  <sepidehshahi> sure, sorry about that
2019-02-28T18:31:01  <gmoss> sepidehshahi: if it's decided that March 20th is the day for the visit, I'll mark that community meeting as cancelled
2019-02-28T18:32:47  <avtar> sepidehshahi: i'm free on the 20th
2019-02-28T18:33:28  <sepidehshahi> awesome! thanks avtar
2019-02-28T18:33:30  <avtar> also, this might be a good opportunity to suggest 49 mccaul for the beverley meeting
2019-02-28T18:33:59  <avtar> due to logistical issues with the elevator at 205 richmond
2019-02-28T18:34:11  <sepidehshahi> I’m not sure if that space is available, I can check and also is there anything here that we want to show them?
2019-02-28T18:34:34  <avtar> i'm assuming the usual demos?
2019-02-28T18:35:50  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: Susie mentioned two different mailing list one was inclusive something. Do you happen to remember which mailing lists they were?
2019-02-28T18:37:19  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I don't know, was it inclusive network and stem network?
