2019-01-04T18:36:58  <sominee> Hello Everyone! I am Sominee, i'm a student from India. I have experience in web development  I wanted contribute to IDI's projects.
2019-01-04T18:37:32  <sominee> Is this the right channel I should be on ?

2019-01-04T18:41:40  <gmoss> hi sominee, welcome. this, #fluid-work and #fluid-tech are the IRC channels we use. If you're interested in contributing to GSoC projects, I would suggest checking out this page on our Wiki: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Getting+Started+on+GSoC
2019-01-04T18:42:32  <gmoss> We're still sorting out 2019 GSoC details, so please bear with us
2019-01-04T18:43:59  <sominee> Sure @gmoss, Thanks! Is there a slack channel too that I could join to stay updated ?
2019-01-04T18:47:24  <gmoss> sominee: I'm not sure if we'll be using slack this year, so I would stick to IRC :)
2019-01-04T18:47:47  <gmoss> sominee: or you could join the community mailing list if you haven't already. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved
2019-01-04T18:55:52  <sominee> I have joined the mailing list. I'll go through the links you sent, too much information there, thanks :)

2019-01-04T20:03:28  <sominee> can I contribute to any project on github's fluid-lab, fluidproject, inclusive-design pages ? Including the previous year's GSoC projects ?
2019-01-04T20:15:19  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.122.106.129> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-01-04T20:27:10  <gmoss> sominee: as long as you follow the code contribution guidelines, you're welcome to contribute to any of our public projects, including previous year's GSoC projects
2019-01-04T20:27:11  <gmoss> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Contributing+Code
2019-01-04T20:27:47  <gmoss> Please note that this does not mean that if you make a proposal for a GSoC project that we will accept it. Any contributions are greatly appreciated all the same

2019-01-04T20:36:11  <sominee> Alright! I also wanted to ask that the issues on the most of the github repositories are not listed, should I only refer to issuse.fluidprojects.org and ask my doubts regarding those there ?
2019-01-04T20:40:22  <colinclark> sominee: That's correct. We use JIRA for our issue tracker, rather than Github Issues. So you can find all the issues for different projects and components at https://issues.fluidproject.org.
2019-01-04T20:41:19  <sominee> colinclark : Thanks, got it!
