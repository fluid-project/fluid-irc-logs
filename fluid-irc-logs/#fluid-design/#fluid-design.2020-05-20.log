2020-05-20T14:21:44  <danielcho> Hey clown, do you know how to leave a group chat and disable auto join in Adium?
2020-05-20T14:22:40  <clown> Hey danielcho.  I used to know how to disable auto join…  What is a "group chat" — is this IRC channel a "group chat"?
2020-05-20T14:22:58  <danielcho> yeah, one of this IRC channel
2020-05-20T14:23:30  <clown> I have my UI set up such that each channel is a different tab.  To leave, you close the tab
2020-05-20T14:24:16  <danielcho> ah, that's how my UI set up is, but it seems like it auto joins when I login again
2020-05-20T14:24:18  <clown> but that does not disconnect you from the server (irc.freenode.net)
2020-05-20T14:26:52  <clown> This might be it:  Preferences… -> Accounts shows a list of the servers (irc and others)
2020-05-20T14:27:06  <clown> open the "freenode.irc.net" if that is the server you use.
2020-05-20T14:27:40  <clown> Under its "Account" tab, there is a "Connect when Adium opens" checkbox in the lower left
2020-05-20T14:27:47  <clown> Uncheck it.
2020-05-20T14:28:17  <danielcho> oh, I think I disabled by removing the autojoin command for the channel in the accounts tab
2020-05-20T14:29:39  <danielcho> it's just a channel, so I think removing the autojoin command would help for my case
2020-05-20T14:29:45  <danielcho> thanks clown :)
2020-05-20T14:29:56  <clown> no problem.  I hope I helped :-)

2020-05-20T15:27:35  <cindyli> greatislander: i ran into a problem with styling placeholder svgs on the "views" page and would like to ask for your suggestion. these placeholder svgs are placed to the page using svg <symbol> then referred by <use> - https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/. those svgs are created as closed shadow-root DOMs that are not stylable via page css. It means I cannot use css to reach into their "path" tags to change the "fil
2020-05-20T15:27:35  <cindyli> l" attribute values for high contrast themes. Using straight inline svg with {% include 'svg/placeholder.svg' %} would bypass the closed shadow-root situation but eventually, when the "view" page becomes a dynamic vue page at implementing its search and filtering features, we still need to go back to the <symbol> & <use> method because nunjucks syntax as "include" is not supported inside the vue syntax. I wonder if you have thought
2020-05-20T15:27:35  <cindyli> s on how to solve this problem?
2020-05-20T15:29:50  <greatislander> I have an idea, cindyli, but it's not fully fleshed out yet
2020-05-20T15:30:40  <cindyli> cool. love to hear when it's ready

2020-05-20T15:39:51  <greatislander> cindyli it looks like you can add stroke and fill directly to the `<use />` element
2020-05-20T15:40:16  <greatislander> Demo: https://codepen.io/greatislander/pen/YzydJVN
2020-05-20T15:40:43  <greatislander> If you edit the html and add a `by` class to the `.content` div, the `use` element picks up the new color
2020-05-20T15:40:49  <greatislander> let me know if this makes sense
2020-05-20T15:46:24  <cindyli> greatislander: it does make sense. one difference from the placeholder svg is the placeholder svgs are colourful with all "path" tags having a "fill" colour. this solution cannot override the path specific colours. I made a little adjustment to your demo by adding a fill colour to one path element. not sure if you can see my change - https://codepen.io/greatislander/pen/YzydJVN
2020-05-20T15:46:43  <greatislander> ah, right
2020-05-20T15:46:53  <greatislander> Let me grab that svg and add it. I can't see your change
2020-05-20T15:47:00  <cindyli> ah ok
2020-05-20T15:47:03  <cindyli> thanks

2020-05-20T16:10:35  <cindyli> Justin_o: thanks for adding the example page for FLUID-6499. i tried it but didn't see much difference with each option. with slow network connection, the page is lagging at the load and showing a blank page. but once loaded, all font families in the first option are applied. we probably should have a call to share screen when you have time ;)
2020-05-20T16:11:04  <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, after the GPII meeting I can connect with you
2020-05-20T16:11:20  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2020-05-20T16:17:58  <greatislander> okay cindyli https://codepen.io/greatislander/pen/YzydJVN
2020-05-20T16:18:12  <greatislander> it involves adding a class for each shade of the logo but it works with two test themes
2020-05-20T16:18:21  <greatislander> CSS custom properties to the rescue!
2020-05-20T16:20:31  <cindyli> you are genius! thanks, greatislander
2020-05-20T16:20:59  <greatislander> i'm sure it can be improved a bit but this should work generally
2020-05-20T16:21:43  <cindyli> super!
