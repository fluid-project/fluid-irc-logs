2019-02-14T14:21:17  <cindyli> jhung and others, I have some diagrams created using OmniGraffle. as now we don't have licenses for OmniGraffle, I cannot edit those diagrams. do you know any free tools that can open and edit OmniGraffle diagrams? The only one i found is https://www.lucidchart.com/. but it requires to create a free trial premium account that will be valid for 7 days. Wonder if there are other long term options.
2019-02-14T14:22:04  <jhung> cindyli: I've used Google Drawings in the past for simple diagrams.
2019-02-14T14:22:18  <cindyli> cool. trying.. thanks
2019-02-14T14:22:47  <jhung> It's super basic, but does the job if all you need is the ability to connect boxes and have different shapes and connectors cindyli
2019-02-14T14:22:48  <cindyli> btw, can Google Drawings import OmniGraffle files, or I need to redraw from scratch?
2019-02-14T14:23:17  <jhung> cindyli: I've been redrawing them. Sometimes I would use Illustrator if I need it to look a little nicer.
2019-02-14T14:23:41  <cindyli> ok. i use draw.io but it also cannot import OmniGraffle files
2019-02-14T14:25:15  <jhung> That brings up a good point… I think we should keep an SVG of the drawings we create so we can have some sort of continuity between applications cindyli.
2019-02-14T14:26:07  <cindyli> ya, good point.

2019-02-14T16:24:33  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: looks like the TTC delays today are a bit worse than usual, so I don't think I'll make it in time for standup. Here's my update, assuming I don't make it. Yesterday we had Colin showing us his work in the community meeting, then I met with Michelle to review the Google doc we've been using to plan development of the storytelling tool and devised a plan to move away from it. I filed a few jiras, made some
2019-02-14T16:24:33  <gmoss> filters and otherwise reorganized things. I spent a little time trying to fix a blocking issue I ran into with SJRK-216 but had no luck solving it. Today I plan to keep trying and to address Cindy's feedback on my many pull requests
