2020-09-29T13:13:22  <greatislander> hi justin_o, if you have a chance to look at any of the other PRs on fluidic-11ty today that would be greatly appreciated (specifically https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/24 and https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/30). I'm realizing that some of the changes in those are blocking my work on https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/issues/28 to some extent.
2020-09-29T13:13:46  <greatislander> It's not a big deal if you don't have time to look at them but of you do that would be fantastic.
2020-09-29T13:13:57  <Justin_o> greatislander: I'll add them to my list for today
2020-09-29T13:14:12  <greatislander> thanks so much justin_o
2020-09-29T14:02:40  <sepidehshahi> danayo: and Cheryl, I went through all the content that was taged “Reviewed” on the Embedded Co-design kit and left comments
2020-09-29T14:03:27  <sepidehshahi> As I’m not aware of your entire process, some of my comments may be irrelevant, so please discard those ones and let me know if any of the comments is not clear :)
2020-09-29T14:03:51  <sepidehshahi> You have done an awesome Job! there is so much great content there!
2020-09-29T14:09:00  <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you use a specific structure of template that I can follow to create a case study for remote co-design?
2020-09-29T15:20:40  <danayo> hi sepidehshahi! sorry I missed your pings, thank you so much for all the feedback!
2020-09-29T15:21:12  <danayo> we don’t really have a case study template, not yet, but let me see what we’ve got
2020-09-29T15:22:19  <sepidehshahi> no worries danayo! sure, just let me know the text limits and I’ll prepare the content based on that
2020-09-29T15:27:00  <danayo> sepidehshahi: there are no text limits exactly, we’re just trying to keep it as concise as possible :)
2020-09-29T15:28:03  <sepidehshahi> For sure! thanks danayo :)
