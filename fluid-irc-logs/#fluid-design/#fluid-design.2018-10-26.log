2018-10-26T13:02:37  <carenwatkins_> Hi all, quickly checking in and see there was a request for photos from DEEP. There are a few from the 25th event filed under IDRC-Event-Images in a folder called 25th Anniversary (pls check with Justin about using any pics of Hannah--I'm not sure if he's reviewed and removed them yet).

2018-10-26T18:04:41  <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung, do you know if we have a topic for next week design crit?
2018-10-26T18:08:39  <jhung> Hi sepidehshahi - nothing yet. Do you have something?
2018-10-26T18:09:27  <avtar> jhung, sepidehshahi: if there's time i'd like to squeeze in the sjrk site as a topic https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/MQ5n1mlALfb86Nw#pdfviewer
2018-10-26T18:09:39  <avtar> i'll have a couple revisions
2018-10-26T18:09:39  <sepidehshahi> yes jhung, could we use the time to share our sketches for the inclusive cities toolkit?
2018-10-26T18:10:16  <sepidehshahi> avtar: maybe we could split the session. We won’t need more than half hour
2018-10-26T18:10:39  <sepidehshahi> or we can talk about the cities toolkit in the community meeting so avtar can take the design crit
2018-10-26T18:11:16  <avtar> splitting the session sounds good
2018-10-26T18:13:24  <jhung> great. avtar and sepidehshahi, could you both give me a short description what is being discussed and what you hope to get out of the discussion?
2018-10-26T18:13:46  <sepidehshahi> sure jhung
2018-10-26T18:13:48  <jhung> You can tell me here or email it to me. I'm fine either way
2018-10-26T18:13:53  <sepidehshahi> I’ll email that to you
2018-10-26T18:13:57  <jhung> ok
2018-10-26T18:20:33  <avtar> jhung: i'll email as well

2018-10-26T20:03:22  <alanharnum> late Friday video of interest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5-bHJqtQS0 - Google's Creatability project, similar to some of the work we've done with the Nexus
2018-10-26T20:03:31  <alanharnum> colinclark simonjb in particular ^
2018-10-26T20:04:15  <colinclark> oh yes
2018-10-26T20:04:27  <colinclark> this just hit the news yesterday and I've been meaning to take some time to look at it
2018-10-26T20:05:59  <alanharnum> one of the interesting claims is that the machine learning is all browser-side using https://js.tensorflow.org/, so it can learn an individual's body models without needing to push any images to a remote server
2018-10-26T20:06:14  <colinclark> that's interesting

2018-10-26T20:10:55  <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: this is incredible! thanks for sharing. One of the biggest challenges we dealt with in our co-design sessions were when people with different abilities wanted to sketch or build something together, and our tools were really inaccessible… I can see how in the future actual collaboration can be made possible
