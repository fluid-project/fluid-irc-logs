2019-01-14T18:19:56  <danayo> hi cherylhjli, noon will def be best - I’ll respond now
2019-01-14T18:21:39  <cherylhjli> thanks danayo!

2019-01-14T18:31:41  <sepidehshahi> sure jhun
2019-01-14T18:31:46  <sepidehshahi> jhung:
2019-01-14T18:50:39  <gmoss> jhung: we're still nailing down the particulars of the process for tomorrow, and we have a meeting early tomorrow morning with Justin_o, so for your email I think this will work: "We'll be conducting some user testing of the latest version of the Storytelling Tool and discussing the outcomes of that process"
2019-01-14T18:50:49  <gmoss> what do you think, sepidehshahi, michelled, simonjb?
2019-01-14T18:51:12  <michelled> sounds good!
2019-01-14T18:51:20  <sepidehshahi> I think it sounds good gmoss

2019-01-14T19:34:23  <jhung> colinclark - I have a question for you about CLAs. In the case where the participants are minors, the legal guardian would be the ones signing the CLA?
2019-01-14T19:34:34  <colinclark> hi jhung
2019-01-14T19:34:45  <colinclark> I think that is the case, yes
2019-01-14T19:35:03  <colinclark> A legal guardian would have to sign it
2019-01-14T19:35:37  <colinclark> in those cases, it might be easier to a) do events with parents present or b) don't gather contributions directly from minors
2019-01-14T19:36:03  <colinclark> parents or legal guardians, that is
2019-01-14T19:42:59  <jhung> colinclark: ok Thanks. I think we'll be doing work with minors as part of CISL. So I want to make sure all the forms are clear for the REB.
2019-01-14T19:43:31  <colinclark> yup, that makes sense
2019-01-14T19:43:50  <colinclark> I'm sure it would be reasonable also to create a little package for parents and guardians
2019-01-14T19:44:02  <colinclark> explaining what we're doing, what's being contributed to, etc.
2019-01-14T19:44:51  <jhung> Definitely colinclark.
2019-01-14T19:45:33  <colinclark> sepidehshahi recently responded to some feedback on the REB for storytelling that may be helpful, too
2019-01-14T19:46:33  <jhung> colinclark: yep. I checked in with her last week. I'd already incorporated some of that.I was thinking we'll need to include some age appropriate documentation so it can be communicated clearly to minors what they will be asked to be involved in.
2019-01-14T19:46:46  <colinclark> That's a great idea, jhung
2019-01-14T19:47:10  <jhung> Can anyone make a version of a CLA or an Assent Form using pictures?
2019-01-14T19:47:13  <jhung> :)
2019-01-14T19:47:22  <colinclark> Something we can start to build up and share templates for across CISL, the storytelling work, and Coding to Learn and Create
2019-01-14T19:47:34  <colinclark> since they all have similar concerns
2019-01-14T19:49:06  <sepidehshahi> jhung: I think creating a visual version of the CLA is a great idea and that could be useful for many people
2019-01-14T19:50:28  <jhung> sepidehshahi: Yes! I'll see what I can do about making at least a simpler version of some of the documentation for different age groups.
2019-01-14T19:51:21  <sepidehshahi> that would be great! please share the results with us and let me know if you needed any  help
2019-01-14T19:51:54  <colinclark> avtar could make a little comic book :)
2019-01-14T20:24:32  <danayo_> cherylhjli: not sure what happened there
2019-01-14T20:24:46  <danayo_> probably my wifi :(

2019-01-14T22:45:53  <cherylhjli> danayo, I'm about to send the spreadsheet off. A few minor changes… for each example of content, I also have an associated column asking for "what need is it missing", just like the features. I do think that if there is content there, it should also be fulfilling a need (ex. narratives from co-op members fulfill the need of potential co-op members understanding it from someone who they consider a peer, podcast fulfill the need of
2019-01-14T22:45:53  <cherylhjli>  multimedia content to accommodate different learning needs, etc).
2019-01-14T22:47:09  <danayo> agree cherylhjli, that sounds good (assumin you mean what need is it meeting)
2019-01-14T22:47:21  <cherylhjli> hahahah yes!!
