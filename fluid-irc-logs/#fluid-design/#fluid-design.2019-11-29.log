2019-11-29T16:28:26  <sepidehshahi> Hi simonjb and danielcho, for the error state, do you prefer a static note on the main interface that switches to ‚ÄúNot connected‚Äù staus after a specific time or a modal that requires user confirmation and then the status will be ‚ÄúNot connected‚Äù
2019-11-29T16:29:46  <sepidehshahi> a static note might be missed by some users
2019-11-29T16:31:31  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I think a modal is a good idea
2019-11-29T16:32:01  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: shouldn't Not connected be the default status?
2019-11-29T16:32:30  <sepidehshahi> great simonjb ! I‚Äôll add that frame to the wires
2019-11-29T16:32:45  <simonjb> thanks very much sepidehshahi
2019-11-29T16:35:11  <sepidehshahi> Yes danielcho, ‚ÄúNot Connected‚Äù is the default. and after a connection is not established, a modal is shown. Once that modal is closed, the status will be ‚ÄúNot Connected‚Äù again
2019-11-29T16:39:15  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: simonjb suggested having another state called "Something went wrong", so shouldn't we show that after the modal is closed?
2019-11-29T16:40:19  <sepidehshahi> I think we can show that nformation on the modal, is that correct simonjb?
2019-11-29T16:41:43  <simonjb> yes, I think your suggestion of using a modal is better and in that case, we wouldn't need the "something went wrong"
2019-11-29T16:42:41  <simonjb> and after the model is dismissed, we show the state as "not connected"
2019-11-29T16:42:46  <simonjb> sepidehshahi, danielcho ^
2019-11-29T16:42:51  <cherylhjli> michelled you want to touch base right now?
2019-11-29T16:43:04  <michelled> sepidehshahi: can you send a message to Tracy to schedule that meeting?
2019-11-29T16:43:08  <danielcho> ah, that makes sense
2019-11-29T16:43:12  <michelled> cherylhjli: yeah, that would be great

2019-11-29T16:50:05  <simonjb> hi michelled, are you doing work on JIRA at the moment? danielcho is unable to assign a JIRA issue to himself and wondering if it could be related to work that you might be doing?
2019-11-29T16:51:20  <michelled> hey simonjb, probably - sorry about that
2019-11-29T16:51:33  <michelled> I won't be able to address it for a little while but I'll message when I manage to
2019-11-29T16:51:44  <simonjb> thanks michelled
2019-11-29T16:51:46  <simonjb> danielcho ^
2019-11-29T16:52:15  <danielcho> thanks michelled!
2019-11-29T17:04:04  <michelled> danielcho: can you try now?
2019-11-29T17:04:45  <danielcho> michelled: still not able to
2019-11-29T17:04:55  <michelled> what happens when you try?
2019-11-29T17:06:04  <danielcho> michelled: I don't see an option to assign task to myself under people tab
2019-11-29T17:06:16  <danielcho> that's where it should be, right?
2019-11-29T17:07:13  <michelled> which JIRA?
2019-11-29T17:07:24  <danielcho> C2LC-36 https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/C2LC/issues/C2LC-36?filter=allissues
2019-11-29T17:07:44  <danielcho> you think it could be cache not updating?
2019-11-29T17:10:50  <michelled> danielcho: try again now please
2019-11-29T17:11:10  <danielcho> michelled: it's working now, thanks for the fix :)
2019-11-29T17:11:17  <michelled> np!
2019-11-29T17:11:57  <michelled> danielcho, simonjb, avtar, colinclark, sepidehshahi: please let me know if you see any odd or unexpected behaviour in the C2LC JIRA. I'm in the midst of working on it and I don't have everything set up correctly yet
2019-11-29T17:12:11  <avtar> michelled: sounds good
2019-11-29T17:12:12  <michelled> and I also don't have a chunk of time to test it all right now :)

2019-11-29T17:12:24  <michelled> I'll test slowly over time, but if you see something, please tell me

2019-11-29T17:50:00  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: and danielcho I have added the modal. When you can please have a look and let me know if that‚Äôs ok
2019-11-29T17:53:39  <simonjb> looks good sepidehshahi. the notes "Status: Not Connected" and such on the first screen are just notes on the design and not shown in the UI, is that correct? In the UI we just show the icon?
2019-11-29T17:54:30  <sepidehshahi> that‚Äôs correct. And I think the screen reader will also read the status information
2019-11-29T17:54:35  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: yeah, the modal looks great :)

2019-11-29T18:37:40  <colinclark> michelled, greatislander: Any chance I could borrow some of your time for 10 minutes?
2019-11-29T18:46:09  <michelled> colinclark: I can meet right now
2019-11-29T18:49:54  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I'm thinking should we disable the "Run" button when no robot is connected? Or leave enabled and do nothing? Or show a dialog saying "please connect to Dash"?
2019-11-29T18:50:03  <simonjb> danielcho ^
2019-11-29T18:50:28  <colinclark> great, michelled. greatislander are you free?
2019-11-29T18:50:46  <michelled> yup
2019-11-29T18:50:50  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: maybe we keep it disabled
2019-11-29T18:51:11  <danielcho> simonjb: ah it's about the condition check I included on C2LC-37
2019-11-29T18:51:19  <simonjb> danielcho: yes :)
2019-11-29T18:51:58  <danielcho> disable would prevent users from clicking run button
2019-11-29T18:52:08  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: so run is enabled when Dash is connected and disabled when not?
2019-11-29T18:52:26  <simonjb> (and in the future, we can generalize to 'any robot is connected')
2019-11-29T18:54:04  <sepidehshahi> that‚Äôs correct. If you want we can add a text label to the Play button to a text form like ‚ÄúMove Dash‚Äù, so it becomes clearer what the button does
2019-11-29T18:54:25  <greatislander> colinclark michelled just getting back from lunch, are you meeting now?

2019-11-29T18:55:53  <simonjb> danielcho: let's do the Run button disabling as part of C2LC-37 -- I'll add a note to the PR
2019-11-29T18:56:02  <danielcho> sure :)

2019-11-29T19:15:25  <simonjb> sepidehshahi, danielcho: I just though of something -- what do we do on non-Chrome browsers?
2019-11-29T19:15:49  <simonjb> Chrome is the only browser that Dash connection works on
2019-11-29T19:16:01  <sepidehshahi> In non-chrme browser we don‚Äôt support robot connection, right?
2019-11-29T19:16:15  <simonjb> right now you can still use the turtle i other browsers
2019-11-29T19:16:22  <sepidehshahi> I know‚Ä¶
2019-11-29T19:16:30  <simonjb> but when we remove, you won't be able to do anything
2019-11-29T19:17:26  <sepidehshahi> So, should we just restrict to chrome for this version, because otherwise there is no point
2019-11-29T19:17:54  <simonjb> show a message "The Coding Environment only works in Chrome"?
2019-11-29T19:18:42  <sepidehshahi> is it possible to connect to Sphero on non chrome browsers?
2019-11-29T19:18:50  <simonjb> no, same issue
2019-11-29T19:19:17  <simonjb> robot connection only works in chrome because it's the only one with the bluetooth functionality
2019-11-29T19:20:39  <sepidehshahi> I see! sure then we can add the message. Should we disable all UI or still they can play with UI but the message appears at the top?
2019-11-29T19:21:19  <simonjb> good question

2019-11-29T19:27:05  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: maybe we try initially showing a prominent message at the top and leaving the UI still there?
2019-11-29T19:27:27  <simonjb> explaining that a browser with bluetooth support is needed
2019-11-29T19:27:56  <simonjb> and if that's too confusing, we instead just show the message and hide the UI
2019-11-29T19:32:54  <simonjb> colinclark: we're just thinking about with the Turtle removed, the coding envrionment won't do anything useful on browsers without bluetooth and we're thinking about how to handle. My initial thought is to show a prominent message explaining that a browser with bluetooth is needed (Chrome) and to leave the UI otherwise present (but unable to connect to Dash or run a program)
2019-11-29T19:35:10  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: or how about showing the UI but with an overlay explaining that Chrome is needed? you can see the UI underneath but can't use it
2019-11-29T19:39:07  <colinclark> I think I agree with the idea of leaving the UI visible and usable, but with the prominent message
2019-11-29T19:39:31  <colinclark> And maybe something that says we‚Äôre working on more support
2019-11-29T19:41:42  <danielcho> what about detect if browser in use is supporting bluetooth and if not shows a modal on page load with messages? users can still use UI features with connect to dash and run button disabled?
2019-11-29T19:44:16  <sepidehshahi> I like what colinclark is suggesting and we should still show the ‚Äúconnect to dash‚Äù button but in disbaled state
2019-11-29T19:44:43  <colinclark> yup, that makes sense, sepidehshahi
2019-11-29T19:45:08  <colinclark> I‚Äôm really thinking we want to avoid modals if possible, so that people can still see the application, even if they can‚Äôt use it
2019-11-29T19:45:30  <colinclark> or at least those kinds of modals that grey out or hide things behind them
2019-11-29T19:45:49  <simonjb> sounds good to me: prominent message with 'connect to dash' control present but disabled?
2019-11-29T19:47:27  <danielcho> oh I was thinking modal that can be closed, modal is just to deliver message about the browser they are using is not supporting bluetooth API, and suggest using the app on Chrome
2019-11-29T19:48:03  <danielcho> users can still see and interact with block editor after they close the modal
2019-11-29T19:48:13  <colinclark> ah, i see
2019-11-29T19:49:22  <danielcho> the message is only required for other browsers than Chrome, so I was thinking we can use condition check to display the message or not
