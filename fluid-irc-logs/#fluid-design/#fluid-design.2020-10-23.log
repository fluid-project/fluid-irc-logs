2020-10-23T13:53:58  <greatislander> Hi gtirloni! I'm wondering if there's a good way to set up internal redirects for the static sites (e.g. guide.inclusivedesign.ca and handbook.floeproject.org) that are hosted on our infrastructure. It looks like guide.inclusivedesign.ca is using the Docpad redirector plugin: https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/main/docpad.js#L48-L63
2020-10-23T13:55:05  <gtirloni> greatislander: hi! We have some sites with redirects but that's done at the load balancing layer, before it reaches the webserver/app itself. I think that'd work in this case
2020-10-23T13:55:06  <greatislander> I could probably replicate this functionality in Eleventy (that Docpad plugin creates html files at the source urls with 0-second meta refresh tags pointing to the destination url) but not sure if that's the best approach
2020-10-23T13:55:39  <greatislander> Ah, yeah, that would be great, because then we would be able to provide a proper redirect code, yes?
2020-10-23T13:55:56  <gtirloni> yep
2020-10-23T13:55:59  <greatislander> Is there a good standard format for me to provide redirect mapping for you, gtirloni?
2020-10-23T13:56:13  <gtirloni> can you see this? https://github.com/inclusive-design/ops/blob/main/environments/production/group_vars/load_balancers#L374-L397
2020-10-23T13:56:23  <greatislander> Nope, I cannot
2020-10-23T13:56:32  <gtirloni> one sec
2020-10-23T13:56:37  <greatislander> cool!
2020-10-23T13:59:04  <gtirloni> ok, try again please. I've added the "WebDev" team with read access to the ops repo
2020-10-23T14:01:26  <greatislander> that's great, thanks gtirloni
2020-10-23T14:06:53  <greatislander> okay here's a question, gtirloni: looking at those redirects, I assume they are 301 permanent redirects. Is there a way to define a 302?
2020-10-23T14:08:56  <gtirloni> greatislander: yep, where it says "last", you can replace with "redirect".. that will be a 302
2020-10-23T14:09:06  <greatislander> ah great, thanks!
2020-10-23T14:10:05  <gtirloni> :)
2020-10-23T14:24:40  <greatislander> gtirloni I've just opened https://github.com/inclusive-design/ops/pull/27. You should be able to safely merge it before the Eleventy conversion is completed as it will just bypass the redirects that Docpad generates. Let me know if you see any issues, I think I got the syntax right :)
2020-10-23T14:25:36  <gtirloni> greatislander: awesome!! thanks for contributing to the ops repo :)
2020-10-23T14:26:17  <greatislander> my pleasure! looks like some cool Ansible stuff you have going on there. As an Ursula Le Guin fan I've always enjoyed that Ansible exists and has that name :)
2020-10-23T14:26:56  <gtirloni> hahaha nice
2020-10-23T14:27:16  <gtirloni> soon that repo will have terraform stuff.. to make it more sci-fi-y
2020-10-23T14:34:30  <greatislander> yesss
2020-10-23T15:05:28  <sepidehshahi> hi greatislander, I’m not sure if we have decided to use Matrix for our daily chats. If that’s the case, could you please share the link here so I can join the team chat? thx
2020-10-23T15:06:44  <greatislander> Hi sepidehshahi, I think we are still in an evaluation process and will be trying it out— I believe Justin is going to send an email out to that effect on Monday. For now, here is the link so you can join the community: http://matrix.to/#/+fluid-project:matrix.org
2020-10-23T15:07:07  <sepidehshahi> Great! thanks so much
