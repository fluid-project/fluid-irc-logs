2019-12-20T15:29:55  <michelled> hey cherylhjli I updated the visual roadmap this morning https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ExVQ4YiS9PtQPNzWPAPdsEzOZHmZ_94WxKBFk07C0ME/edit#gid=0
2019-12-20T15:30:54  <cherylhjli> thanks michelled!
2019-12-20T15:31:48  <alanharnum> michelled danielcho1 avtar: so https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/ and other C2LC sites are currently hosted and deployed via Netlify - it should be no problem to set the 0.1 release up to do the same, but I think the repo will need to be configured for this. I can tackle this myself if someone can give me admin rights to the repo at https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment
2019-12-20T15:31:55  <alanharnum> simonjb ^
2019-12-20T15:33:10  <danielcho1> alanharnum: thanks Alan for setting the environment up! I think michelled or simonjb can help you with the permission
2019-12-20T15:33:46  <simonjb> alanharnum: I can give you admin rights, what changes will you need to make?
2019-12-20T15:35:05  <alanharnum> Netlify needs to generate an API key for the organization / repo, I think - I believe avtar set up the other sites, so he might be able to do this as well
2019-12-20T15:35:28  <avtar> yup i can
2019-12-20T15:35:38  <avtar> simonjb: i'll be in the office after standup
2019-12-20T15:36:38  <simonjb> alanharnum: do you still need the admin access, or will avtar be making the necessary changes to the repo?
2019-12-20T15:36:39  <alanharnum> ok - if avtar can do that I should then just have to set up the domain config. (sorry, I should have checked this yesterday - I thought prototype was running on our Docker host for some reason, but now I remember we set it up on Netlify)
2019-12-20T15:36:46  <alanharnum> avtar can make the necessary changes
2019-12-20T15:37:01  <simonjb> ok, cool, I'll work with avtar when he's in the office
2019-12-20T15:37:07  <alanharnum> i am happy not to have more admin access to manage
2019-12-20T15:37:13  <alanharnum> :)
2019-12-20T15:37:14  <simonjb> :)
2019-12-20T15:37:47  <alanharnum> once this is set up on Netlify you'll also have more flexibility to manage it yourselves in terms of changing repo, branch etc without going through me (the basis for using Netlify to begin with)
2019-12-20T15:38:01  <simonjb> cool
2019-12-20T15:39:28  <simonjb> alanharnum, avtar: so we should be able to get the deployment set up this afternoon?
2019-12-20T15:39:37  <avtar> sounds good

2019-12-20T15:43:48  <alanharnum> simonjb: yeah I don't think that will be any issue - once Avtar sets it up in Netlify I just make a CNAME record in our DNS to point to the Netlify domain, same as we do for all the other C2LC sites.
2019-12-20T15:44:13  <simonjb> alanharnum: what will trigger the build and deployment?
2019-12-20T15:44:35  <alanharnum> simonjb: pushes to the designated branch, same as other static sites
2019-12-20T15:45:17  <simonjb> In Jenkins? I'm wondering if we should use GitHub Actions as we have that in place for our CI and deployment of master dev branch
2019-12-20T15:45:37  <alanharnum> Jenkins isn't in the mix on this at all - all done by Netlify
2019-12-20T15:45:51  <simonjb> ah, Netlify watches and runs the build?
2019-12-20T15:46:03  <alanharnum> yup
2019-12-20T15:46:06  <simonjb> cool

2019-12-20T15:47:15  <alanharnum> Netlify handles https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-exploratory -> https://prototype.codelearncreate.org/ in this way, FE
2019-12-20T15:49:29  <simonjb> alanharnum, avtar: it looks like Netlify provides GitHub Actions integration, let's chat avtar when you are here about our options to compare what we have in place for the prototype vs a GitHub Actions driven alternative
2019-12-20T15:49:34  <simonjb> https://github.com/netlify/actions
2019-12-20T15:50:06  <alanharnum> I think Actions wasn't out of beta last time we set up some Netlify things, so definitely worth looking at
2019-12-20T15:51:42  <simonjb> for the master dev deployment, we are using Firebase -- it might make sense to also move that to Netlify (not today)
2019-12-20T15:52:01  <simonjb> dev.codelearncreate.org or such
2019-12-20T15:52:22  <simonjb> it's currently https://c2lc-dev.web.app/
2019-12-20T15:52:29  <alanharnum> interesting, how is Firebase being used? (I did a bunch of stuff with Firebase early on when it launched, before Google acquired it)
2019-12-20T15:52:41  <simonjb> https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml
2019-12-20T15:53:06  <simonjb> we're just using its free-tier static hosting
2019-12-20T15:53:16  <simonjb> no database or other server-side functionality
2019-12-20T15:53:19  <alanharnum> i feel so out of the loops on GitHub actions, have barely even looked at them
2019-12-20T15:53:48  <simonjb> I'm really liking them for c2lc
2019-12-20T15:54:14  <simonjb> it's really nice to have CI on every commit and merge, directly in GitHub

2019-12-20T16:47:38  <simonjb> thanks sepidehshahi, it looks like Michelle is managing the resources site. I'll let her know if she's online later

2019-12-20T17:13:23  <jhung> cherylhjli I came across this map / index for OERs. It may give you some ideas for the PC Index. It has an "Story" filter so you can learn from other people's experiences which I thought was interesting. https://oerworldmap.org/resource/

2019-12-20T17:27:27  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: for this version, we are targeting Windows, Mac, and Chromebook. It won't work on iPhone Chrome, I believe, but it might work on Android Chrome. Would you like me to check?
2019-12-20T17:28:54  <sepidehshahi> Iâ€™m just adding a line about required technologies for the activities. So I wanted to include accurate info. If you can check it would be great
2019-12-20T17:29:43  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I'll check on my phone now and let you know
2019-12-20T17:30:42  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: though it might be safest in this version to just say Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Chromebook
2019-12-20T17:30:50  <simonjb> but let me do a quick check and let you knpw
2019-12-20T17:30:53  <simonjb> know
2019-12-20T17:32:00  <sepidehshahi> for sure simonjb I can just include Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Chromebook
2019-12-20T17:36:44  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I tested on Chrome on Android and while it does work, the experience isn't awesome: 1. you can only see 2 program blocks at a time 2. the Dash error dialog doesn't fit on the screen 3. the editor controls overlap the "Program" heading
2019-12-20T17:37:04  <simonjb> (on my phone, a Pixel 3)
2019-12-20T17:37:49  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I think for this release, we should say we support Windows, Mac, and Chromebook, and add a better phone experience in the future
2019-12-20T17:40:15  <simonjb> but maybe don't say that we will add a better phone experience so we aren't committing to it -- but it's something we should discuss the priority of and design for
2019-12-20T17:44:32  <colinclark> That makes sense to me, simonjb
2019-12-20T17:44:44  <colinclark> Iâ€™d love for our environment to work great on a phone
2019-12-20T17:45:19  <colinclark> but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s our top priority. I think supporting the devices that are most prominently in schoolsâ€”especially Chromebooksâ€”is the best place to start and grow from
2019-12-20T17:45:52  <colinclark> as you say, it makes sense not to commit to it until weâ€™re sure we can put it on our roadmap and do a good job of it
2019-12-20T17:46:33  <sepidehshahi> thanks simonjb for checking it with your phone. Sure we will try to improve the mobile experience for the following versions

2019-12-20T18:39:49  <michelled> I'd like to add it to the sidebar but I wont do so until it's filled out more
2019-12-20T18:40:23  <sepidehshahi> avtar should we upload them in our youtube channel?

2019-12-20T18:42:01  <Teddy_> what else needs to be filled out before you add it
2019-12-20T18:42:31  <michelled> well, it should be useful for someone not working on the project
2019-12-20T18:42:37  <michelled> right now there's no information on it
2019-12-20T18:45:25  <michelled> if you flip through the project links in the left nav you see what I mean - it's different for different projects, but someone not working on the project could get a sense of what the project is and where to look for more information

2019-12-20T20:26:47  <michelled> sepidehshahi: I switched to using a Hugo shortcode to embed the videos in your activities. When I was testing locally, the width seemed fine, but now it seems a little wide. are you ok with this? https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/dash-and-dot/tracing/
