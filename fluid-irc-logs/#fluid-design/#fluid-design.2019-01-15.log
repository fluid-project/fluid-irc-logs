2019-01-15T15:04:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do we have any utilities that would do something like this. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L385
2019-01-15T15:05:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this particular line doesn't seem to work as one would like anymore because of the other values in the model that aren't saved for the remoteModel. I think instead i'd look at the model.local path, but there should usually be a preferences object even though it might be empty.
2019-01-15T15:05:32  <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, but this logic isn't really correct anyway
2019-01-15T15:05:44  <Justin_o> haha.. okay so we're getting to the same point :)
2019-01-15T15:05:51  <Bosmon> Instead we have to have some kind of independent record of which settings the user has changed away from their initial values or defaults

2019-01-15T15:10:13  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - so I get the same behaviour either on trunk or with your GPII-3594 branch which I was testing
2019-01-15T15:10:28  <cindyli> ah ha. great discovery
2019-01-15T15:10:52  <Bosmon> I notice that under Linux by the time of the hang the process has allocated 2.6G virtual memory and has about 1.1G resident
2019-01-15T15:11:10  <Bosmon> Your branch doesn't seem to make any difference so I guess I may as well merge it
2019-01-15T15:12:06  <cindyli> yay! thanks. i'm investigating to see if there's a way to bypass this load issue in the code

Today I have meetings most of the day starting at noon-2 (alumni inclusive design program evaluation meeting) followed by the community meeting. See you soon.

2019-01-15T21:10:30  <cherylhjli> Happy to do a walkthrough sometime!

2019-01-15T21:26:30  <danayo_> ok avtar, thanks
2019-01-15T21:28:45  <jhung> cherylhjli: thanks! I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

2019-01-15T22:11:50  <danayo_> cherylhjli: just came across this interesting calendar interaction and thought of the p coop events calendar https://pushfestival.ca/festival-events/?calendar#view
2019-01-15T22:12:10  <danayo_> try selecting some dates
2019-01-15T22:12:39  <danayo_> it seems useful in a circumstance where there are many events
2019-01-15T22:12:44  <danayo_> probably not so if the list is short
2019-01-15T22:14:03  <cherylhjli> oh wow! I like the use of these accordions
2019-01-15T22:14:34  <alanharnum> I was wrong (IDRC office conversation), it was JT who was the expert testimony in the Australia web accessibility case in 2000: https://www.humanrights.gov.au/bruce-lindsay-maguire-v-sydney-organising-committee-olympic-games
2019-01-15T22:14:56  <cherylhjli> something to consider when we bring the event calendar back for a later version, or if trebor has a lot of events to park under each institution page.
2019-01-15T22:15:14  <danayo_> yes. I particularly liked that it started by crossing out dates, rather than selecting
2019-01-15T22:15:15  <gmoss> alanharnum: that's awesome! thanks for sharing :)
2019-01-15T22:15:22  <danayo_> I was surprised by that
2019-01-15T22:15:27  <alanharnum> it's quite fascinating to see how big commercial companies (IBM, in this case) talked about web accessibility in that era as something that was incredibly resource-consuming and difficult
2019-01-15T22:15:27  <danayo_> but found it quite useful
2019-01-15T22:15:34  <danayo_> cherylhjli ^
2019-01-15T22:15:53  <alanharnum> also fascinating for the attempt to claim HTML source code as proprietary and not subject to outside review
2019-01-15T22:16:32  <gmoss> alanharnum: favourite quote: "There is no sound basis for questioning the expertise of ... Ms Treviranus."
2019-01-15T22:16:32  <cherylhjli> danayo: I was surprised by that too! At first I was weirded out about it, but now that I think about it it makes sense - people would tend to know more what day they're not available / have another thing already. It almost encourages people to go to multiple events because by default you have more dates selected.. than just selecting one particular day you're interested in
2019-01-15T22:17:29  <danayo_> that's true cherylhjli
2019-01-15T22:17:41  <cherylhjli> danayo: I've also been trying to write some rationale for not having all 8 narratives on the home page, in case we have that conversation tomorrow.
2019-01-15T22:17:51  <danayo_> great cherylhjli

2019-01-15T22:44:18  <avtar> specifically https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/#dns-configuration
2019-01-15T22:45:10  <alanharnum> avtar: at first glance, looks a lot like the custom subdomain setup for Github pages
2019-01-15T22:45:13  <avtar> i'm about to point sojustrepairit.org to 104.198.14.52 and www.sojustrepairit.org to social-justice-repair-kit.netlify.com
2019-01-15T22:45:59  <alanharnum> is the outcome of this that SJRK is now hosted on Netlify's servers, not ours? (this is fine, just want to be clear on what's going to happen)
2019-01-15T22:46:09  <avtar> yup
2019-01-15T22:46:41  <avtar> netlify will redirect visitors to a site generated and hosted by them
