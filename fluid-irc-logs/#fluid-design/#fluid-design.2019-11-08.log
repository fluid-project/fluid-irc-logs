2019-11-08T15:59:09  <michelled> gmoss: I merged your pull request that adds the Stories tab to the sjrk site
2019-11-08T15:59:28  <michelled> do you also have one that fixes the logo on the stories site so that we can navigate back?

2019-11-08T16:09:51  <gmoss> Thanks, michelled! By "fixes", do you mean make it a link to the SJRK site? I thought I mentioned both PR's in my email, but let me find you the link
2019-11-08T16:10:16  <michelled> yes, that's what I meant

2019-11-08T16:12:13  <gmoss> This should be the one, michelled: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/48
2019-11-08T16:12:30  <gmoss> I guess I didn't send them along after all, I thought I had. Sorry!
2019-11-08T16:12:37  <michelled> no worries
2019-11-08T16:14:02  <gmoss> btw michelled I'll have to look into why/how the 'weight' fields were removed, it seems odd
2019-11-08T16:14:44  <michelled> yeah, and I don't like changing things underneath that should be controlled by netlify especially if we don't understand how the two are interacting
2019-11-08T16:19:14  <gmoss> michelled: that's a reasonable concern. I'll try to find out what may be causing that. I might need credentials for the repro at some point

2019-11-08T21:59:14  <gmoss> ping michelled
2019-11-08T21:59:23  <michelled> hi gmoss
2019-11-08T22:00:52  <gmoss> avtar and I weren't able to get me access to the Netlify interface, but I watched him use it and noticed some odd things. I also found some lines in the admin directory's config.yml that explain how the extra fields got there. I'm still not sure why the weight got removed, but it seems promising.
2019-11-08T22:01:27  <gmoss> I wanted to ask if you can recall why the imgURL, imgCap and imgAlt fields were added to the "resources"-type pages
2019-11-08T22:01:49  <gmoss> https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/blob/master/static/admin/config.yml#L55
2019-11-08T22:02:12  <gmoss> following the git-blame didn't clear everything up for me, I guess
2019-11-08T22:03:52  <michelled> it might have been so that dana could add an image to the top level resources page
2019-11-08T22:06:19  <gmoss> michelled: okay, that seems to line up with the commit messages. I'm trying to see if it's necessary to specify it there, since it's only for the top-level page. those 3 fields also show up in each sub-page's editor (each accordion piece)
2019-11-08T22:07:06  <michelled> does that cause any issue gmoss?
2019-11-08T22:07:07  <gmoss> anyway, the weird thing was that even though the weight is specified, when avtar went to edit a particular page, the weight field showed as empty, and once he began to edit it, the "type" field changed from "resource" to the same number as the weight field, as if they're linked somehow. this could be a factor
2019-11-08T22:07:20  <gmoss> michelled: I'm not sure that it causes an issue, but it may be related
2019-11-08T22:07:28  <gmoss> i.e. if they're left blank, maybe it does weird things to the weight
2019-11-08T22:07:43  <gmoss> still exploring :)
2019-11-08T22:07:59  <michelled> yeah, that's possible
2019-11-08T22:08:26  *** clown <clown!clown@nat/ocadu/x-kagwmsczvenicecu> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-11-08T22:08:30  <gmoss> (unrelated, I've opened a PR for 286! huzzah)
2019-11-08T22:08:41  <michelled> great!
2019-11-08T22:11:12  <gmoss> michelled: I think I may have found part of the issue: https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/blob/03f40d7cc9bbc40d220583b37e44329b83278c64/static/admin/config.yml#L54 the "name" is "type" instead of "weight"
2019-11-08T22:11:54  <michelled> ugh!
2019-11-08T22:11:55  <gmoss> explains the weirdness I witnessed. may not explain how weight disappeared. anyway, I'll make a note on the PR and fix that
2019-11-08T22:11:56  <michelled> good catch
2019-11-08T22:12:04  <michelled> thx
2019-11-08T22:19:31  <gmoss> michelled: I've updated the PR with my fix and a note summarizing what I've said in here: https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/pull/67
2019-11-08T22:20:10  <michelled> thx gmoss
2019-11-08T22:22:20  <michelled> gmoss: I'm fairly certain that's fixed it!
2019-11-08T22:22:30  <gmoss> michelled: awesome!
2019-11-08T22:23:06  <gmoss> a little bit of testing in production? haha
2019-11-08T22:23:40  <gmoss> btw if the proper workflow is to do PR's into the dev branch, I can do that next time. I chose the master branch since it was vastly more up to date
2019-11-08T22:24:00  <michelled> I don't think we use the dev branch
2019-11-08T22:24:06  <michelled> Netlify works directly on master
2019-11-08T22:24:21  <michelled> I suspect the dev branch predates our use of netlify
2019-11-08T22:24:35  <gmoss> michelled: makes sense
