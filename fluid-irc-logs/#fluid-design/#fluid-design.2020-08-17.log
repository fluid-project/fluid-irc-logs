2020-08-17T15:06:14  <jhung> cherylhjli for tomorrow's design crit, can you give me a quick description of the topic?
2020-08-17T15:10:08  <cherylhjli> yep jhung - i'll send one to you
2020-08-17T15:10:20  <jhung> thanks cherylhjli
2020-08-17T15:15:07  <cindyli> greatislander: i'm using https://www.integromat.com to set up a chain that changes to wecount airtable will trigger a netlify deploy. To do so, Integromat requires a netlify access token to establish a connection with netlify. I found my role on the netlify for the wecount site is a collaborator and don't have the privilege to request such a token for the site. I wonder if you have the privilege to help me create a token. this is t
2020-08-17T15:15:07  <cindyli> he integromat doc of how to connect netlify with it - https://support.integromat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014833720-Netlify
2020-08-17T15:15:48  <greatislander> Hi cindyli, I'll make you an admin as you should have those privileges!
2020-08-17T15:16:23  <cindyli> cool. thanks, greatislander
2020-08-17T15:18:25  <greatislander> hmm, I'm puzzled as you appear to be set as a team owner for the Inclusive Design Research Centre Netlify team cindyli
2020-08-17T15:18:50  <cindyli> ah ha
2020-08-17T15:18:53  <greatislander> You don't have the option to create a token from your profile, or the token is not valid for the We Count site?
2020-08-17T15:19:29  <cindyli> i can create a token but using this token can only see the project for myself in integromat, not the wecount site, greatislander
2020-08-17T15:19:39  <greatislander> hmm
2020-08-17T15:19:46  <cindyli> let me try again
2020-08-17T15:19:58  <greatislander> That doesn't make sense to me, because we appear to have the same privileges for the We Count site
2020-08-17T15:22:50  <cindyli> umm.. ok. tried again, still cannot see IDRC projects in integromat. searching if other ppl have the same issue...
2020-08-17T15:30:08  <greatislander> weird!
2020-08-17T15:30:39  <greatislander> do you see this page, cindyli? https://app.netlify.com/teams/inclusive-design/members
2020-08-17T15:31:29  <cindyli> nice, i have owner state ;)
2020-08-17T15:32:13  <cindyli> greatislander: i found i only see projects under my default team, which is auto-created when I created my netlify account
2020-08-17T15:32:28  <greatislander> ah, interesting
2020-08-17T15:32:35  <cindyli> i cannot see IDRC projects because they belong to IDRC team
2020-08-17T15:32:37  <greatislander> might be worth contacting Integromat support
2020-08-17T15:32:48  <cindyli> good point
2020-08-17T15:32:48  <greatislander> maybe they only let you integrate with your own team
2020-08-17T15:33:04  <greatislander> in which case Zapier is a good alternative, I know they support other teams
2020-08-17T15:34:28  <cindyli> that's great. thanks. I will try Zapier too. I pick integromat first because its free plan offers 1000 actions per month and Zapier free plan offers 100 actions per month. 10 times difference :)
2020-08-17T15:35:00  <cindyli> i will contact integromat support too when trying Zapier. maybe i missed something
2020-08-17T15:48:17  <cindyli> Teddy___: see you in the wecount room?

2020-08-17T16:24:01  <gmoss> cindyli: do you mind if we don't do ST check-in today, or maybe later on? I'm not feeling great at the moment
2020-08-17T16:25:20  <cindyli> sure, gmoss. let's skip today's check in. take care!
