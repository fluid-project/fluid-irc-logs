2020-08-18T12:22:28  <gtirloni> the cities.inclusivedesign.ca website will be down for a moment while I transition it from Jenkins to GitHub Actions
2020-08-18T12:29:15  <greatislander> morning gmoss! when you are online, if you have a moment, I've finally addressed https://github.com/inclusive-design/idrc/issues/30 and would love you to test in Edge 44 :)
2020-08-18T14:12:52  <gtirloni> gmoss cindyli: which version of nodejs do you use to develop the SJRK website? 10 or 12?
2020-08-18T14:24:10  <cindyli> sorry, gtirloni, just saw ur msg. mine is v10.15.3
2020-08-18T14:24:24  <gtirloni> cindyli: thanks
2020-08-18T14:24:27  <cindyli> np
2020-08-18T14:25:52  <greatislander> Hi gtirloni, shall we use the general Zoom room for our call in five min?
2020-08-18T14:28:51  <gtirloni> greatislander: yep, that's fine
2020-08-18T14:29:07  <greatislander> okay sounds good, be right there
2020-08-18T14:52:12  <cindyli> greatislander: will you have time today to chat about the map created in the platform coop project?
2020-08-18T14:52:24  <greatislander> yes!
2020-08-18T14:52:27  <greatislander> after standup?
2020-08-18T14:52:35  <cindyli> sure. thanks, greatislander
2020-08-18T14:52:53  <greatislander> sounds good cindyli
2020-08-18T15:18:28  <gmoss> gtirloni: I run Node v10.15.3 as well. There were previously some obstacles to running v12, but those may have been dealt with. I can confirm later today, if you like
2020-08-18T15:18:52  <gtirloni> gmoss: awesome, thanks
2020-08-18T15:19:16  <gmoss> greatislander: sadly, I don't run Edge 44 any more! Microsoft began pushing out to regular users in June, so we decided no longer to support it in the Storytelling Tool and I updated to the latest Chromium-based Edge :(
2020-08-18T15:32:08  <greatislander> ah, okay. No worries. If you want to check out the PR anyway I'd value any feedback!
2020-08-18T15:32:21  <gmoss> greatislander: sure, I'll check it out after planning :)
2020-08-18T15:35:14  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: the Iteration Planning meeting is starting soon
2020-08-18T16:01:51  <cindyli> greatislander: shall we stay in the standup room after the planning meeting for our map chat?
2020-08-18T16:02:03  <greatislander> sounds good, I will need to take a quick break
2020-08-18T16:02:35  <cindyli> sure.
2020-08-18T16:30:11  <gmoss> cindyli danayo: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-08-18T16:31:04  <danayo> gmoss: I’m in the PPIG session
2020-08-18T16:31:07  <danayo> for a while longer I think
2020-08-18T16:31:11  <gmoss> danayo: no worries :)
2020-08-18T16:32:05  <gmoss> I don't mind holding off until later, or we can skip today. I have a small collection of non-Storytelling tasks on my plate
2020-08-18T16:32:39  <cindyli> i'm fine either way, gmoss
2020-08-18T16:33:02  <danayo> let’s meet up tomorrow gmoss, cindyli
2020-08-18T16:34:15  <gmoss> danayo: sounds good :)
2020-08-18T16:34:15  <gmoss> cindyli: I'll just update here. I've been working my way through SJRK-289 merge conflicts, only requestHandlers.js is left but there are a few knots to untangle. Hopefully I can get to that today :)
2020-08-18T16:34:49  <cindyli> good to know. thanks, gmoss
2020-08-18T16:44:58  <gmoss> greatislander: I just tested out your PR, looks like it's working as intended in the browsers on my machine. I've left a comment to that effect on the PR
2020-08-18T16:45:08  <greatislander> awesome, thanks gmoss!
2020-08-18T17:29:31  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-08-18T17:46:08  <greatislander> jhung I have a semantics/ARIA (?) question for you
2020-08-18T17:47:48  <greatislander> not urgent, but maybe after the design crit if you have 10 minutes?
2020-08-18T17:51:21  <jhung> Sure greatislander remind me to hang back.
2020-08-18T17:51:40  <greatislander> will do!
2020-08-18T17:51:53  <jhung> fluid-everyone - design crit will be starting in about 8 minutes. Today we're talking about the IDRC projects / tools page redesign.
2020-08-18T18:22:04  <michelled> colinclark, philip: thanks for letting me crash the tour :) I enjoyed it a lot!
2020-08-18T18:22:16  <colinclark> that was awesome
2020-08-18T18:22:25  <colinclark> thanks for your contributions
2020-08-18T18:22:25  <michelled> .,,,,,,
2020-08-18T18:22:31  <colinclark> it’s a weird and wonderful way to see our city
2020-08-18T18:22:40  <michelled> sorry, Mowg wants to participate too
2020-08-18T18:23:30  <philip> That was really neat, thanks for joining Michelle
2020-08-18T18:24:33  <michelled> :)
2020-08-18T18:59:16  <gmoss> colinclark philip: was the tour recorded? I would love to learn more about my city :)
2020-08-18T18:59:47  <colinclark> Hi gmoss, sorry, we decided not to record any of the sessions
2020-08-18T19:00:04  <gmoss> colinclark: gotcha :)
2020-08-18T19:10:45  <greatislander> jhung free for that quick chat?
2020-08-18T19:10:55  <jhung> greatislander give me 5 minutes?
2020-08-18T19:10:58  <greatislander> cherylhjli: I am also available for a quick debrief :)
2020-08-18T19:11:00  <greatislander> sure jhung!
2020-08-18T19:11:15  <cherylhjli> lol sure greatislander - let's chat when you're done chatting with Jon
2020-08-18T19:11:16  <greatislander> cherylhjli, let's chat now and then jhung can jump in when he is ready
2020-08-18T19:11:45  <greatislander> I'm in the general room cherylhjli
2020-08-18T19:12:02  <cherylhjli> ok!
2020-08-18T20:09:48  <cindyli> gtirloni: you added a Dockerfile for the wecount website repo a couple of month ago - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca#how-to-deploy-using-docker. it stops working because the recent change adds 2 more dependencies:
2020-08-18T20:09:59  <cindyli> 1. a netlify function that serves a server side API;
2020-08-18T20:10:35  <cindyli> 2. Airtable structures for saving data on a remote relational database - airtable.com
2020-08-18T20:11:55  <cindyli> to get the local docker back to work, I think we need to be able to run netlify dev environment and an airtable simulator in the docker. i have no luck with my search for these 2 things
2020-08-18T20:14:10  <cindyli> not sure if you have experience with them. for now, i'm thinking to remove the deploy with docker from the repo
2020-08-18T20:20:11  <gtirloni> I've never run into netlify local dev or airtable simulator, unfortunately :(
2020-08-18T20:22:27  <gtirloni> is there any open source alternative we could use locally?
2020-08-18T20:30:42  <cindyli> i haven't found any. this is one i found related to airtable - https://hub.docker.com/r/aafrey/submit-to-airtable/. but without description and a how-to, it doesn't look promising
2020-08-18T20:32:55  <cindyli> gtirloni: airtable support page says it has no plan on offering an on-premise or self-hosted solution. sad…
2020-08-18T20:33:35  <gtirloni> sad indeed
2020-08-18T20:33:46  <gtirloni> that kind of limited our CI options
2020-08-18T20:33:50  <gtirloni> *limits
2020-08-18T20:33:55  <cindyli> ya
2020-08-18T20:34:07  <gtirloni> is airtable like google sheets? I need to read about it
2020-08-18T20:34:51  <cindyli> sort of but more, it offers a cloud of hosting relational databases.
2020-08-18T20:36:36  <cindyli> for now, i will remove the docker support from the repo
2020-08-18T20:37:13  <gtirloni> ok
2020-08-18T20:39:33  <gtirloni> are airtable and netlify functions hard requirements or could we swap them?
2020-08-18T21:00:47  <cindyli> gtirloni: with our current implementation, they are hard requirements. we can swap them by using our own server programming language and database such as php/mysql, which means we need to host our own server. with airtable and netlify functions, the website is lighter and serverless
2020-08-18T21:01:18  <cindyli> apparently, the drawback is the dependency
2020-08-18T21:02:51  <gtirloni> got it, thanks
