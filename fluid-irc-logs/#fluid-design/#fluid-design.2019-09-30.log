2019-09-30T15:27:59  <cherylhjli> sounds good to me michelled

2019-09-30T15:30:31  <greatislander> but I might need to leave a little bit early (by 2:45 at the latest)
2019-09-30T15:30:39  <michelled1> I think we'd be done by then
2019-09-30T15:30:45  <greatislander> cool cool
2019-09-30T15:33:54  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: i continue to experience issues with Vidyo both on my laptop and my phone, so I may not be joining standup today
2019-09-30T15:48:29  <greatislander> michelled1 cherylhjli jhung check in when we do the planning?
2019-09-30T15:48:38  <greatislander> (if that works)

2019-09-30T18:44:39  <jhung_2> Justin_o, gmoss - do we have a plan for tomorrow's design crit on storytelling?
2019-09-30T18:44:44  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2019-09-30T18:48:28  <gmoss>  jhung: I don't have any solid description on-hand, but I figured we could discuss, among other things: the use of the current block setup; the workflow and order of the various parts of the editor (block editing, title/author/tags, preview, publish); whether a wysiwyg, rich text or markdown editor would make sense
2019-09-30T18:48:43  <gmoss> it would be great if colinclark would be able to join us, I imagine he has some thoughts on the matter
2019-09-30T18:48:59  <colinclark> tomorrow’s crit?
2019-09-30T18:49:24  <gmoss> colinclark: yes
2019-09-30T18:49:34  <colinclark> I am indeed free
2019-09-30T18:49:36  <colinclark> until 3 pm
2019-09-30T18:50:57  <gmoss> excellent :) perfect timing. Justin_o do you have any input on the agenda for tomorrow? this is all based on the Ulysses tool you mentioned last week
2019-09-30T18:56:47  <jhung> gmoss For now I will say that the design crit will be continuing the discussion on new ideas and improvements for the storytelling tool?
2019-09-30T19:03:29  *** clown is now known as clown_afk
2019-09-30T19:11:56  <gmoss> jhung: that sounds good! Thanks :) leaves things broad enough to take the discussion where we need to
2019-09-30T19:28:39  <michelled> jhung, gmoss: I wonder if we should wait until dana is available? she was the original designer on the tool
2019-09-30T19:29:15  <gmoss> michelled: I had a similar thought earlier. It seems prudent
2019-09-30T19:29:16  <michelled> sepi and caren also did some work on it but neither of them are likely to be at the crit either
2019-09-30T19:29:32  <gmoss> I don't have any problems with postponing
2019-09-30T19:30:33  <jhung> Makes sense. I can send out a follow-up email.
2019-09-30T19:31:23  <jhung> fluid-everyone - Since we're postponing the discussion on the Storytelling tool, is there any other topics people want to discuss?
2019-09-30T19:45:14  <danielcho> jhung: hey, could we use the time to discuss and have a little sketch session for c2lc prototype?
2019-09-30T19:46:18  <jhung> danielcho sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about it (so I can put the info in the email)?
2019-09-30T19:50:38  <danielcho> jhung: sure! C2LC team members had a sketch session to come up with ideas of how we can make interaction with the coding robots more fun and engaging; some idea we came up with includes, ways to interact with the robots, gamify the interaction like RPG with stories, and some system design — was really abstract ideas, and we though it would be nice to have such sketch session with many other people and I think this is perfect oppo
2019-09-30T19:50:38  <danielcho> rtunity for us
2019-09-30T19:51:01  <danielcho> we thought*
2019-09-30T19:51:10  <jhung> awesome. Thanks danielcho!
2019-09-30T19:51:38  <danielcho> Thank you for the planning!
