2020-04-20T13:57:46  <michelled> but I think coop needs the room at 10:30
2020-04-20T13:58:24  <michelled> snow should either use the floe room or the standup room

2020-04-20T14:07:35  <Caren_> Hi jhung , michelled so I shouldn’t use the room? Can I book floe recurring for up to 2 hours (may need some working time down the road).
2020-04-20T14:09:05  <michelled> Caren_: the floe room is managed by bert is is shared with wecount
2020-04-20T14:09:17  <michelled> as long as you coordinate with the wecount team, I'm sure that would be fine
2020-04-20T14:09:54  <Caren_> blerp…I guess it’s skype today :-) thanks
2020-04-20T14:19:16  <jhung> thanks for catching that michelled. This will be an issue we'll constantly have to deal with.
2020-04-20T14:20:00  <michelled> jhung, I just figure that you, me, justin and bert can't make other meetings

2020-04-20T15:17:15  <michelled> cindyli: do you know if the aihec storytelling site was updated to include the increased story limit?
2020-04-20T15:17:38  <cindyli> checking..
2020-04-20T15:19:07  <cindyli> michelled: no, i will merge the master into stories-aihec-production, which should trigger the deploy with that feature
2020-04-20T15:19:15  <michelled> thanks cindyli
2020-04-20T15:22:10  <cindyli> done
2020-04-20T15:22:34  <michelled> thx! cindyli, I'm guessing the auto-save never got finished, right?
2020-04-20T15:23:12  <cindyli> not yet, michelled. gmoss is working on a temp solution that hopefully can be merged and deployed today
2020-04-20T15:23:37  <michelled> well, given his email, we should probably assume that won't happen.
2020-04-20T15:23:46  <cindyli> michelled: is today the last day for setting up the AIHEC storytelling site?
2020-04-20T15:24:00  <michelled> cindyli: yeah, Jutta said she needs it tomorrow
2020-04-20T15:24:14  <cindyli> ok. let's see
2020-04-20T15:24:28  <michelled> danayo: to my understanding, the AIHEC site currently has the max stories set to 500 and the max files per story set to 50
2020-04-20T15:24:38  <michelled> danayo: the auto-save isn't complete
2020-04-20T15:25:08  <michelled> I think it makes sense to update your docs for Jutta to include that issue and I assume we'll want to tell her about it at standup
2020-04-20T15:29:04  <danayo> ok michelled thanks
2020-04-20T15:29:23  <michelled> np
2020-04-20T15:29:58  <gmoss> michelled: Working on Cindy's review for SJRK-289, hopefully that's all it needs before merging
2020-04-20T15:30:05  <gmoss> then we can start deploying
2020-04-20T15:30:31  <gmoss> auto-save won't include files today, that was a much more complicated prospect and will require some more planning
2020-04-20T15:31:08  <danayo> gmoss: what does that mean from a user’s perspective?
2020-04-20T15:31:20  <danayo> it will auto-save any text content
2020-04-20T15:31:21  <danayo> ?
2020-04-20T15:31:53  <gmoss> danayo: it means that if they include images in their image block, for example, the block will be there with all of the text that was added, but the image file that was uploaded won't be
2020-04-20T15:32:22  <gmoss> so they'll have to re-add it. the worst case is if an image was captured on the mobile device, since it isn't necessarily saved to the Camera Roll and may need to be taken again
2020-04-20T15:32:35  <gmoss> this applies to audio, image and video blocks
2020-04-20T15:32:53  <gmoss> otherwise all the functionality we planned is there. empty blocks are saving, clear on publish, loads on page load, etc
2020-04-20T15:39:30  <gmoss> cindyli: I left a comment on one of your review suggestions :)
2020-04-20T15:40:03  <cindyli> saw it. a reasonable point. thanks, gmoss

2020-04-20T16:33:01  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks for that! the CI build has finished, so autosave and the new limits should be deployed now. I'm running tests currently.

2020-04-20T19:15:54  <danayo> gmoss, michelled we have a landing page, no?
2020-04-20T19:16:08  <danayo> to which we can add this content
2020-04-20T19:16:21  <gmoss> danayo: the root page of the site right now is the browse page, iirc
2020-04-20T19:16:32  <danayo> ah, right
2020-04-20T19:17:11  <danayo> but we could use that page as the landing page, with this content, and move Browse stories to the browse stories page, yes?
2020-04-20T19:17:21  <danayo> *with this new content
2020-04-20T19:17:54  <gmoss> danayo: we can make a new page that shows this message and is otherwise identical to the browse page, yes
2020-04-20T19:17:56  <gmoss> :)
2020-04-20T19:18:09  <gmoss> And make that the landing page
2020-04-20T19:18:13  <michelled> that seems like a good strategy to me
2020-04-20T19:18:49  <gmoss> Okay, I'll get cracking on that. Will do the work under SJRK-337
2020-04-20T19:19:22  <danayo> gmoss, not identical to the browse page, in that stories don’t appear there, right?
2020-04-20T19:20:18  <danayo> I’ll mock something up quickly, I think the logo needs to appear on all pages
2020-04-20T19:21:42  <gmoss> danayo: that's what I was imagining, yeah. But okay, I'll start with the non-user-facing bits and wait for your mock up before proceeding with the rest
2020-04-20T19:22:28  <gmoss> If we use their logo, should we consider the footer content as well?
2020-04-20T19:24:17  <danayo> I don’t think the footer needs to change gmoss

2020-04-20T19:37:58  <danayo> while the AIHEC logo reflects a specific group of stories / specific application of the tool

2020-04-20T20:19:14  <danayo> sorry I mean “The Storytelling Project” text
2020-04-20T20:20:31  <gmoss> danayo: I think it looks good! I'm trying it out on my machine to see how it behaves at various sizes
2020-04-20T20:25:25  <danayo> gmoss: it seems to me that the issue we identified previously (replace Explore Tool button with Home nav link) will be more important now that we’re adding a landing page. Do you think you can make that change? It also means replacing “Start Your Story” button on story tool page with “Browse Stories”
2020-04-20T20:25:34  <danayo> I can create an issue
2020-04-20T20:25:37  <danayo> if you lik
2020-04-20T20:25:38  <danayo> e
2020-04-20T20:26:23  <danayo> best woudl be to have consistent nav, with “current page” indicator
2020-04-20T20:26:38  <danayo> but maybe not possible for tomorrow, I’m guessing
2020-04-20T20:27:32  <gmoss> danayo: I'll think about how I can do that quickly. An issue would be welcome, but isn't necessary :)
2020-04-20T20:28:18  <danayo> ok
2020-04-20T20:28:50  <gmoss> danayo: would your intent be that the "Home" link goes to the welcome page?
2020-04-20T20:28:58  <danayo> yes
2020-04-20T20:29:01  <gmoss> okay

2020-04-20T21:02:29  <gmoss> danayo: I think I've mostly implemented your design, I just need a vector copy of the AIHEC logo
2020-04-20T21:02:36  <gmoss> Do you know where I can find one?
2020-04-20T21:03:01  <gmoss> (it doesn't have to be vector, it'll just look nicer if that's the case)
2020-04-20T21:03:17  <danayo> gmoss they sent a tif
2020-04-20T21:03:25  <danayo> I can ask Jutta if she can get an svg, or ?
2020-04-20T21:03:36  <gmoss> danayo: oh, it's a broken jpeg in my email :(
2020-04-20T21:03:45  <danayo> oh weird
2020-04-20T21:04:07  <gmoss> danayo: I can look around on the internets or on their wiki page
2020-04-20T21:04:41  <danayo> just a sec gmoss
2020-04-20T21:08:30  <danayo> just emailed you gmoss

2020-04-20T22:23:13  <gmoss> it's ready to be merged, once someone is ready to review :)
2020-04-20T22:23:35  <gmoss> I'll email gtirloni with instructions on how to point the landing page at the new Welcome page
2020-04-20T22:24:17  <danayo> ok gmoss, can I preview it somehow?
2020-04-20T22:25:17  <gmoss> danayo: I can try to set up the tunneling service that greatislander uses, so you'd be seeing it hosted from my computer
2020-04-20T22:25:28  <gmoss> let me find that info....
2020-04-20T22:25:56  <danayo> if it’s not too much work gmoss
