2019-04-04T14:41:11  <michelled> hey carenwatkins_
2019-04-04T14:41:53  <carenwatkins_> Hi michelled
2019-04-04T14:42:09  <michelled> I thought it would be good to check in today if you're up fo rit
2019-04-04T14:43:59  <michelled> carenwatkins_:  ^
2019-04-04T14:45:07  <carenwatkins_> How about after lunch sometime michelled ? I'm scheduled to chat with Dana after 3...
2019-04-04T14:45:25  <michelled> I've got meetings from 1-3
2019-04-04T14:45:36  <michelled> so we could talk at 12:30?
2019-04-04T14:46:28  <carenwatkins_> Ok michelled

2019-04-04T14:50:20  <sepidehshahi> Hi carenwatkins_: the landing page on the wiki looks great. Do you mind if I change the layout to a two column so it reads faster and modify the structure of the section about design so I can add the reports about the storytelling workshops?
2019-04-04T14:53:58  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-design
2019-04-04T14:57:19  <carenwatkins_> hi sepidehshahi I was considering the structure yesterday as the content expanded. I agree two columns is better, I also think it should be in blocks and not running as continuous text. I also changed some PDF docs to Word docs (actually we could include both) so they are editable if someone wanted to adapt (OERs). What do you think?
2019-04-04T14:58:40  <sepidehshahi> I totally agree carenwatkins_ I can summarize the info you have about the design and development in the second column and add subpafes for additional information if needed
2019-04-04T15:00:51  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@205.211.168.103> has joined #fluid-design
2019-04-04T15:03:27  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: that might be doubling up work. I have been working through the content/summary. Are you thinking of something else?
2019-04-04T15:05:58  <sepidehshahi> carenwatkins_: Actually I’m not thinking about creating new content it’s just how it is currently organized. For example, in the Outreach and workshops section we have guides, presentations, activities, etc. I don’t think they are needed on the landing page. I’m thinking of moving them to a sub page and just having a link to that page on the landing page, similar to what we have for the environmental scan section
2019-04-04T15:11:18  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: agree...I was thinking of child pages as well. As the content was expanded I was going to further organize in a manageable format. I'm working through it...if you have the time and want to dig in, ok.
2019-04-04T15:12:54  <sepidehshahi> carenwatkins_: do you have time for a qucik chat?
2019-04-04T15:16:35  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: can we chat at noon? I need to finish a design/writing task on the storytelling tool landing page
2019-04-04T15:16:53  <sepidehshahi> for sure carenwatkins_

2019-04-04T16:00:10  <colinclark> sepidehshahi, avtar: I have to leave here around 1230, but do you want to talk for a few minutes before then about your experiences yesterday in class?
2019-04-04T16:01:00  <sepidehshahi> colinclark: I’m going to talk with carenwatkins_
2019-04-04T16:01:39  <sepidehshahi> carenwatkins_: should I join your room?
2019-04-04T16:02:13  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: yes, it's open
2019-04-04T16:02:18  <sepidehshahi> thanks
2019-04-04T16:04:06  <avtar> colinclark: i can chat right now
2019-04-04T16:04:13  <avtar> unless you wanna wait until sepidehshahi is free
2019-04-04T16:04:45  <colinclark> i’d be curious to hear from both of you, yes
2019-04-04T16:04:53  <colinclark> not that i don’t like meeting with you, avtar :)
2019-04-04T16:04:57  <avtar> :(
2019-04-04T16:05:10  <avtar> i think sepidehshahi said earlier that after 2:00 would be good
2019-04-04T16:05:16  <colinclark> ok, i’ll be out then
2019-04-04T16:05:17  <michelled> colinclark, avtar, simonjb, sepidehshahi: maybe we can do a C2LC check in when colin's in later?
2019-04-04T16:05:44  <colinclark> i believe i’m done at Norway between 3-330pm
2019-04-04T16:05:55  <colinclark> and michelled you’d probably know better than me how long it will take me to get to the office from there
2019-04-04T16:05:58  <colinclark> woodbine and kingston rd
2019-04-04T16:06:06  <michelled> about 40 min
2019-04-04T16:06:13  <colinclark> ok
2019-04-04T16:06:26  <michelled> maybe 50 actually - since you aren't on the subway line itself
