2020-01-07T18:42:57  <greatislander> jhung ^
2020-01-07T18:47:47  <lliskovoi___> simonjb_: the problem with the html disabled attribute is that it removes focus from the control, aria-disabled doesn't do that so if we could use that attribute instead we would be able to keep focus on the button while also communicating that it's disabled
2020-01-07T18:49:48  <simonjb_> lliskovoi___: yes, we could definitely use aria-disabled instead -- do you think we should use aria-disabled for other controls also?
2020-01-07T18:50:10  <simonjb_> so that all disabled controls stay focusable?
2020-01-07T18:50:14  <danielcho> simonjb_: seems like React Bootstrap Button component doesn't support aria-disabled
2020-01-07T18:50:42  <simonjb_> danielcho: we should be able to easily add
2020-01-07T18:51:11  <simonjb_> (I hope anyway)
2020-01-07T18:52:33  <danielcho> or I was thinking, since we are going to investigate other component libraries for the modal component, do you think it's reasonable to check button component as well?
2020-01-07T18:54:33  <simonjb_> danielcho: it should just be a matter of providing the "aria-disabled" attribute on the component. When you say "seems like React Bootstrap Button component doesn't support aria-disabled", what do you mean specifically?
2020-01-07T18:54:52  <lliskovoi___> simonjb_, danielcho personally I prefer the aria-disabled approach because it keeps controls discoverable in the tab order. There doesn't seem to be a general consensus on this, some people argue that it makes sense to remove disabled controls from the tab order. But I think especially in this case, considering the issue you mentioned yesterday with the user losing focus when the button is disabled, it makes
2020-01-07T18:54:52  <lliskovoi___> more sense to use aria-disabled. We can use it throughout to keep it consistent, or treat it on a case by case basis if there are certain controls that we do want to remove from the tab order when they're disabled
2020-01-07T18:54:55  <danielcho> I tried providing the aria-disavbled attribute
2020-01-07T18:55:17  <danielcho> and the button was not disabled
2020-01-07T18:56:15  <simonjb_> danielcho: but was aria-disabled on the html element? just setting aria-disabled will only set the attribute, not affect the behaviour
2020-01-07T18:57:15  <danielcho> oh, I will check that and let you know
2020-01-07T18:57:19  <simonjb_> we would need to implement the disabled bahaviour
2020-01-07T18:58:07  <danielcho> right
2020-01-07T18:59:08  <simonjb_> lliskovoi___: do you think aria-disabled is preferable over a run/stop toggle button?
2020-01-07T18:59:40  <danielcho> simonjb_: yeah, aria-disabled is on the html element
2020-01-07T18:59:50  <simonjb_> cool, thanks danielcho
2020-01-07T19:00:04  <danielcho> np!
2020-01-07T19:01:01  <lliskovoi___> simonjb_: I'd like to give it some further thought, but my initial thinking is yes it's better than having a button that changes functions. It's challenging to change the visual, label and state consistently and clearly.
2020-01-07T19:01:19  <lliskovoi___> There is also an issue with labelling impacting voice activation which I just learned about today
2020-01-07T19:01:26  <simonjb_> lliskovoi___: cool, thanks
2020-01-07T19:02:02  <lliskovoi___> have a look at the Changing Labels section here: https://inclusive-components.design/toggle-button/#changinglabels
2020-01-07T19:06:57  <simonjb_> lliskovoi___: another combination that might work (though I've not tested it yet) is: disabled tabindex=0 (that is, HTML disabled, but with tabindex set to say it should be in the tab order)

2020-01-07T19:07:33  <simonjb_> lliskovoi___: do you have experience that the practicality of that approach?
2020-01-07T19:10:12  <lliskovoi___> I've never encountered that, we'd need to test it since there's a chance the disabled attribute will override the tabindex (I'm not basing this assumption on much, just thinking that if it overrides regular tab order it might also override tab index)
2020-01-07T19:11:53  <simonjb_> lliskovoi___: yeah, totally, I've not tried it either

2020-01-07T20:26:38  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: sure :)
2020-01-07T20:26:50  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: yep
2020-01-07T20:26:54  <sepidehshahi> thanks
2020-01-07T20:38:07  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: are we expecting any animation when Delete All button appears?
2020-01-07T20:39:02  <sepidehshahi> no danielcho, once the delete icon is selected, the delete all button also appears in the program area
2020-01-07T20:40:35  <danielcho> ah, I was thinking maybe including subtle animation would look nice like the smooth collapse example from https://react-bootstrap.github.io/utilities/transitions/
2020-01-07T20:40:41  <michelled1> simonjb: can you link me that ai tool you'd shown us yesterday?
2020-01-07T20:41:23  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: on the screen between the red Delete All button and the confirmation dialog, where the button is black -- is that indicating a mousedown press, before releasing? or is something else going on there?
2020-01-07T20:41:44  <sepidehshahi> sure danielcho, if that doesn’t add to your work, I think that would be a nice addition
2020-01-07T20:42:24  <danielcho> sepidehshahi: seems straight forward, so I will try to add and see how it looks :)
2020-01-07T20:42:37  <sepidehshahi> great, thanks
2020-01-07T20:42:54  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: and danielcho do you have any questions?
2020-01-07T20:43:30  <danielcho> Simon has a question about the delete all button: on the screen between the red Delete All button and the confirmation dialog, where the button is black -- is that indicating a mousedown press, before releasing? or is something else going on there?
2020-01-07T20:43:32  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: question above
2020-01-07T20:44:15  <simonjb> michelled1: it's https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ but it seems to not be working today -- I'm getting a form requesting authentication
2020-01-07T20:44:40  <simonjb> michelled1: ah, working now :)
2020-01-07T20:44:52  <michelled1> thx simonjb!
2020-01-07T20:45:01  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: the black color indicates hover state. I can add another state for mousedown press
2020-01-07T20:45:03  <simonjb> maybe they were in the middle of an update
2020-01-07T20:45:04  <michelled1> Teddy_: check that link out
2020-01-07T20:45:21  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: ah hover, cool, thanks
2020-01-07T20:45:38  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I'm not sure how feasible it will be to implement the scrollbar
2020-01-07T20:45:42  <michelled1> Teddy_: this is the type of tool that you could try out and then assess for accessibility
2020-01-07T20:47:00  <Teddy_> Okay, I'll take a look
2020-01-07T20:47:02  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: but we can definitely look into it
2020-01-07T20:47:33  <sepidehshahi> which parts of it are difficult? maybe I could simplify it a bit more
2020-01-07T20:47:52  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: in the shorter term, it looks like we might be able to style the existing browser scrollbar fairly easily -- make in larger for example
2020-01-07T20:48:16  <simonjb> but a custom scrollbar will need some work, that could take a while
2020-01-07T20:48:53  <danielcho> simonjb: I found an example for button scrolling on: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EKoVOj?editors=0010 and width of the scroll bar is modifiable, so I guess we can create two buttons next to the scrollbar with onClick event to handle the scrolling as the example, but yeah, I agree that we will have to see how feasible it is
2020-01-07T20:49:04  <sepidehshahi> no worries, let’s work with what we have. Would you be able to change the color of the scrubber and the timeline?
2020-01-07T20:51:04  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: yes, it looks like Chrome at least has custom CSS properties that should make it possible to style most parts of the scrollbar
2020-01-07T20:51:35  <Teddy_> michelled1 simonjb this is so cool
2020-01-07T20:52:08  <sepidehshahi> ok, let me try simplifying it and see how it looks simonjb
2020-01-07T20:52:21  <michelled1> yeah!
2020-01-07T20:52:31  <simonjb> danielcho, sepidehshahi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar
2020-01-07T20:53:07  <simonjb> https://webkit.org/blog/363/styling-scrollbars/
2020-01-07T20:53:35  <sepidehshahi> and I just noticed that we don’t hover state for any of our other controls. Something to add in the future but for now, you can consider the black color of Delete All button as for mousedown state simonjb and danielcho
2020-01-07T20:53:52  <simonjb> and then Firefox supports some styling, but not as much as WebKit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-width

2020-01-07T20:54:11  <danielcho> simonjb: thanks for the reference!
2020-01-07T20:56:15  <simonjb> sepidehshahi, danielcho: https://css-tricks.com/the-current-state-of-styling-scrollbars/
2020-01-07T20:56:38  <simonjb> so, we should be able to get some way with just CSS
2020-01-07T20:57:06  <simonjb> for now, I'd like to avoid doing too much work on a custom JavaScript scrollbar
2020-01-07T20:57:32  <simonjb> as that has the potential to have lots of edgecases
2020-01-07T20:58:06  <sepidehshahi> that’s reasonable simonjb, so I think we can just play with width and colors to make the current version more accessible
2020-01-07T20:58:15  <danielcho> right, that's a good idea
2020-01-07T20:58:35  <sepidehshahi> in the future if we could include the buttons we should bring them in
2020-01-07T20:59:00  <simonjb> sepidehshahi, danielcho: sounds good, I'll add some notes to the jira
2020-01-07T20:59:19  <danielcho> thanks sepidehshahi and simonjb :)
2020-01-07T20:59:24  <sepidehshahi> as lliskovoi___ mentioned that the buttons are helpful for keyboard users
2020-01-07T21:00:57  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: there's the design of the scrollbar, but Leanne also suggests some automatic scrolling -- what do we think of that?

2020-01-07T21:05:18  <sepidehshahi> I agree with Leanne. In the current build when you add new steps, you don’t see them unless you manually scroll, and this could be confusing for some users. So, if we could include auto scrolling to always see the last few steps woud be very helpful I think
2020-01-07T21:05:45  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: ^
2020-01-07T21:06:01  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: ok, let's try that also
2020-01-07T21:06:19  <sepidehshahi> great, thanks

2020-01-07T21:07:36  <simonjb> danielcho, sepidehshahi: I added some notes to https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/C2LC-117
2020-01-07T21:07:39  <simonjb> reasonable?

2020-01-07T21:11:18  <sepidehshahi> yes, that’s reasonable simonjb
2020-01-07T21:12:50  <sepidehshahi> danielcho: and simonjb can we support a scrubber that its width larger than width of its timeline?
2020-01-07T21:14:55  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: it looks like there's ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb for Chrome (and other WebKit browsers) but we'll need to see how it works

2020-01-07T21:17:04  <simonjb> lliskovoi___ and sepidehshahi: I've added comments to the jiras regarding the new designs and removed the NeedsDesign labels -- thanks very much for your work
2020-01-07T21:17:29  <simonjb> for the Run button, we'll use aria-disabled

2020-01-07T21:34:47  <simonjb> Teddy_: yeah, the Teachable Machine project looks neat, do you have experience with Tensorflow.js?
2020-01-07T21:37:10  <Teddy_> I have used the version for python but not for javascript yet
2020-01-07T21:37:22  <simonjb> Teddy_: cool
2020-01-07T21:37:31  <Teddy_> hopefully there is a keras wrapper for it
2020-01-07T21:37:43  <Teddy_> makes things alot easier aha

2020-01-07T21:44:11  <simonjb> looks like it can do bi-directional conversion of models
