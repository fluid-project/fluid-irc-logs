2019-10-08T18:13:20  <colinclark> alanharnum, cherylhjli1: I’ve tweaked our blurb a tiny bit and written a little “provocative intro” sentence. Any thoughts or edits?
2019-10-08T18:13:25  <colinclark> Data and algorithms aren't neutral—they reflect our biases, hidden assumptions, and systemic exclusions. Want to use your development skills to address these issues of equity and inclusion? Project WeCount will examine issues of discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities in the field of AI and machine learning, in collaboration with the people who have direct experience of this. You will help to build new systems that show how
2019-10-08T18:13:25  <colinclark> can creatively address inequities in this rapidly growing field. Your job will include collaborating with other developers and designers to build interfaces for inclusive AI, participating and supporting co-design sessions, and  building project websites.
