2020-03-26T14:53:04  <lliskovoi_> greatislander, cindyli, I have a few options for the footer in the Figma file, would love to get your thoughts when you have a chance. (if anyone else would like to have a look and give some input, the Figma file is: https://www.figma.com/file/0lcLol3X5MmOXackT2YbHJ/WeCount-website?node-id=239%3A0
2020-03-26T14:59:40  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: where are descriptions for "about", "tools" etc on the footer from?

2020-03-26T15:00:17  <lliskovoi_> cindyli: those are the secondary nav items
2020-03-26T15:00:43  <lliskovoi_> they're the same as what you'd find in side navigation
2020-03-26T15:01:18  <lliskovoi_> the secondary items are from the Website planning content document in teams that Vera created

2020-03-26T15:40:21  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: in terms of the footer design, i like option 1 & 2. another design in my mind is to have all navigation items at the first row and "contact", "follow us", "funders" at the second row. this will create a clearer separation between nav items and other infos. it's sort of like a combination of option 1 and 2.
2020-03-26T15:42:23  <lliskovoi_> thanks cindyli, I did try that but it looked a bit weird because Home, News and Views don't have any secondary items, it also took up a bit too much horizontal space. I'll mock it up. So far everyone seems to like #2 :)
2020-03-26T15:47:19  <lliskovoi_> cindyli, greatislander, have a look at the option Cindy suggested, I think it looks nice
2020-03-26T15:47:33  <lliskovoi_> Vera's vote is still for #2 though haha
2020-03-26T15:48:27  <greatislander> I think I still prefer #2
2020-03-26T15:49:11  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: if we are sure "home", "news", "views" will never have secondary nav items, option 2 does look better
2020-03-26T15:49:38  <lliskovoi_> we're never sure of anything cindyli ðŸ˜‚
2020-03-26T15:50:15  <cindyli> haha. reasonable

2020-03-26T20:41:18  <Teddy___> okay cindyli, I will also add that area when hovering over the previous button is a different size when hovering over the next button
