2020-06-23T16:26:16  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo just sent you a Google Sheet invite to clarify field display on organizational profiles. Let me know if you are available to look at it together.
2020-06-23T16:29:48  <danayo> thanks greatislander I can meet after storytelling checkin, should be done by 1ET
2020-06-23T16:30:30  <greatislander> okay, let's meet in the co-op room then if that works for cherylhjli too
2020-06-23T16:30:43  <cherylhjli> yep
2020-06-23T16:58:25  <danayo> greatislander, cherylhjli I’ll probably need a few more minutes, can I ping you when ready?
2020-06-23T16:58:42  <cherylhjli> yep danayo
2020-06-23T16:59:39  <greatislander> no prob
2020-06-23T17:11:03  <greatislander> I'm just hanging out in the platform co-op room, so I'll see you there whenever cherylhjli danayo
2020-06-23T17:11:24  <danayo> on my way
2020-06-23T19:01:00  <Teddy___> colinclark: michelled: are you free to meet?
2020-06-23T19:01:11  <michelled> yup! shall we meet in the wecount room?
2020-06-23T19:01:19  <Teddy___> okay
2020-06-23T19:03:25  <colinclark> i’ll be a few minutes late, sorry
2020-06-23T19:03:28  <colinclark> but i’ll be there
2020-06-23T19:31:37  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo it looks like there is no differentiation between members and founders in the Members tab for a co-op. Is that correct?
2020-06-23T19:33:59  <danayo> greatislander: I think there should be distinct categories
2020-06-23T19:34:32  <greatislander> Both in the overview and the members tab?
2020-06-23T19:34:56  <cherylhjli> maybe they can be in one tab, with two headings?
2020-06-23T19:35:03  <cherylhjli> "Founders" and "members" as headings
2020-06-23T19:35:13  <greatislander> I agree they should be in one tab.
2020-06-23T19:35:15  <danayo> yes greatislander. And I agree, one tab
2020-06-23T19:37:23  <greatislander> So what should the title of the tab and the section on overview be? "Founders and members"?
2020-06-23T19:40:11  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo ^
2020-06-23T19:41:18  <cherylhjli> works for me
2020-06-23T20:09:15  <danayo> sorry I missed this greatislander, that suggestion sounds good to me to
2020-06-23T20:09:16  <danayo> too
