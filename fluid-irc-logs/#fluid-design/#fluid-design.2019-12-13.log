2019-12-13T16:23:59  <michelled> or you can just tell me here
2019-12-13T16:24:18  <danielcho> oh sure, I just thought about something for #1

2019-12-13T16:25:49  <danielcho> michelled: Web Bluetooth API is only supported on Chrome and Opera, but not all other browsers — so I think specifying that 'connect to dash' button will be only disabled on FF & Safari might not be a good idea
2019-12-13T16:26:16  <danielcho> Also, run button should be disabled until dash is connected as well
2019-12-13T16:28:07  <michelled> oh, danielcho it doesn't look disabled right now
2019-12-13T16:28:29  <danielcho> on https://c2lc-dev.web.app/ ?
2019-12-13T16:28:53  <michelled> yeah, I guess it must be, but it doesn't look it

2019-12-13T16:49:10  <danielcho> clown: haha it's going forever
2019-12-13T16:49:45  <clown> then is't not really "recursive".  it diverges
2019-12-13T16:50:24  <danielcho> clown: I think it stops at some point and I was trying to inspect that :)
2019-12-13T16:50:25  <cherylhjli> check in danayo?
2019-12-13T16:50:58  <clown> keep looking, danielcho.  you'll find it. *crosses fingers*
2019-12-13T16:51:02  <danayo> yes cherylhjli
2019-12-13T16:52:16  <danielcho> clown: haha thanks!
2019-12-13T16:53:40  <danielcho> michelled: there will be some behaviour changes to the run button while program is running, which we should be testing for 0.1 release as well — once simonjb reviews C2LC-100 and merge the change
2019-12-13T16:54:37  <simonjb> danielcho, michelled: can we do a C2LC checkin at 1?
2019-12-13T16:54:39  <michelled> danielcho: what are the behaviour changes?
2019-12-13T16:54:44  <michelled> yup!

2019-12-13T16:55:45  <danielcho> michelled: one I talked about during the stand up — right now, you can just press run button while program is running and multiple runs interrupt commands with each other, so we should disable run button while program is running
2019-12-13T16:57:08  <danielcho> maybe we should talk with simonjb where to implement this during today's meeting but I filed Jira issue https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/C2LC-100 and submitted a pull request for that
