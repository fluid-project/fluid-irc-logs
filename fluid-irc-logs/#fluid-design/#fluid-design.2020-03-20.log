2020-03-20T17:37:04  <greatislander> FYI colinclark cherylhjli, I'm stepping back from styling a little bit to set up the backend a bit more
2020-03-20T17:37:19  <colinclark> cool greatislander
2020-03-20T17:37:28  <greatislander> Using Netlify CMS for the moment but we can change that in future as the site grows
2020-03-20T17:42:03  <colinclark> I think that’s a reasonable compromise
2020-03-20T17:42:08  <colinclark> Netlify’s good enough for now
2020-03-20T17:42:33  <colinclark> I’ve been doing other writing yesterday and today so far, greatislander, but has Jutta put anything into the Google Doc
2020-03-20T17:42:44  <greatislander> not yet that I'm aware of
2020-03-20T17:42:47  <colinclark> ok
2020-03-20T17:42:53  <colinclark> we’ll need to encourage her on monday
2020-03-20T17:43:12  <colinclark> I can add some sections, but I need to finish this document and then I’m scheduled to help philip with something he’s writing for the We Count site
2020-03-20T17:43:23  <greatislander> I think she said on standup that she'd be doing so later today though
2020-03-20T17:43:26  <colinclark> oh great
2020-03-20T17:43:41  <colinclark> I took a long walk along the Humber River this morning, which should help keep my head clear for writing :)
2020-03-20T17:53:29  <erictheise> nice.

2020-03-20T19:18:44  <cindyli> hi greatislander, using css selector: button[aria-expanded="true"] + nav works great at toggling the navigation menu on the mobile design. but this selector is so specific that it take precedence over the style for "nav" selector on the desktop design, is there a way to override it with a more generic style?
2020-03-20T19:19:43  <greatislander> cindyli if you use the button[aria-expanded="true"] + nav selector only for visibility on the mobile design, and then add the other styles to the mobile nav rule, then they should be able to be overridden by the desktop nav selector
2020-03-20T19:19:46  <greatislander> something like:
2020-03-20T19:20:20  <greatislander> ```
2020-03-20T19:20:20  <greatislander> // mobile
2020-03-20T19:20:20  <greatislander> nav { // Nav styles for mobile }}
2020-03-20T19:20:20  <greatislander> button[aria-expanded="true"] + nav { display: block; }
2020-03-20T19:20:20  <greatislander> ```
2020-03-20T19:20:38  <greatislander> ```
2020-03-20T19:20:38  <greatislander> // desktop
2020-03-20T19:20:38  <greatislander> nav { // Nav styles for desktop
2020-03-20T19:20:38  <greatislander> ```
2020-03-20T19:20:49  <greatislander> Let me know if that works
2020-03-20T19:20:50  <greatislander> !
2020-03-20T19:20:58  <cindyli> ok thanks

2020-03-20T19:24:20  <cindyli> very smart to only control the showing/hiding in a more specific selector. works like a charm! thanks, greatislander
