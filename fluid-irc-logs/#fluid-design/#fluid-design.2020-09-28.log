2020-09-28T14:31:31  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o— looking at https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/pull/15 am I correct in understanding that the current release of fluid-grunt-lint-all will throw a linting error if it encounters the `async` keyword in front of an asynchronous function?
2020-09-28T14:32:40  <Justin_o> greatislander: it will throw a parsing error as the parsers available to the included fluid-eslint fork do not support async/await syntax
2020-09-28T14:32:48  <greatislander> okay, that's what I thought, thanks
2020-09-28T14:33:05  <greatislander> Is there any testing/review I can do to help with that PR?
2020-09-28T14:33:40  <greatislander> I mean, I can test it but is there anything in particular you'd like me to look at?
2020-09-28T14:34:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks.. please do.. I think we'll need to wait for the-t-in-rtf to merge it, but any testing and review would likely speed up that process.. same for the eslint-config-fluid PR I have submitted.. although perhaps Bosmon can merge that one
2020-09-28T14:34:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm sure that Antranig can as well.
2020-09-28T14:34:24  <greatislander> sounds good, I'll check it out
2020-09-28T14:34:32  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'll put it on my calendar for tomorrow just in case
2020-09-28T14:34:42  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks :)
2020-09-28T14:34:52  <greatislander> thanks the-t-in-rtf!
2020-09-28T14:35:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I would have got to it today, but someone finally came to install light fixtures.
2020-09-28T14:35:50  <the-t-in-rtf> we've been using our phones to get around the house after dark.
2020-09-28T14:35:51  <Justin_o> greatislander: I think a general test of making sure that things that should have failed or passed still work as expected and that new syntax can be supported (note you might have to set up the eslint parser in the config).
2020-09-28T14:36:22  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: that's extreme.. glad you'll be getting your light fixtures in.. the days are probably starting to get short
2020-09-28T14:36:39  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, especially once daylight savings kicks in in a few weeks
2020-09-28T14:37:25  <Justin_o> greatislander: you should also verify that if there are no lint errors that then number of files checked is still reported by the eslint task
2020-09-28T14:37:33  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I was thinking perhaps we should add a warning about valid-jsdoc to our task.
2020-09-28T14:37:40  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'll comment on the pull if you haven't already done that.
2020-09-28T14:38:36  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: if you could leave a comment on the PR that would be great.. I'm not 100% what you'd like as a warning
2020-09-28T14:39:09  <the-t-in-rtf> Depends if ESLint shows a warning about the deprecation.
2020-09-28T14:39:38  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: oh yes, it does show a warning in the output. That's how I found out about it actually.
2020-09-28T14:40:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I was just thinking a line to point out how to migrate, perhaps to a section in our README or separate migration notes.
2020-09-28T14:40:11  <the-t-in-rtf> a warning is fine.
2020-09-28T14:40:26  <the-t-in-rtf> or did you silently evolve that setting for them?
2020-09-28T14:41:06  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I think linking to a README is fine for now.
2020-09-28T14:41:41  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: well depends.. I made the change in eslint-config-fluid https://github.com/fluid-project/eslint-config-fluid/pull/8 but there is no automated translation of configuration in fluid-grunt-lint-all
2020-09-28T14:41:57  <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, makes sense.
2020-09-28T14:42:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess it's fine, we didn't create the problem and "most people" will pick up a good fix automatically when they update
2020-09-28T14:42:38  <the-t-in-rtf> did you add a note in the associated eslint-config-fluid pull?
2020-09-28T14:43:03  <the-t-in-rtf> don't see one.
2020-09-28T14:43:15  <the-t-in-rtf> As long as it's mentioned somewhere that makes sense, that's fine
2020-09-28T14:43:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't expect you to put in a warning infrastructure for problematic settings
2020-09-28T14:43:42  <the-t-in-rtf> but it'd be nice to have something that comes up in issue searches
2020-09-28T14:44:05  <the-t-in-rtf> which probably we have at this point.
2020-09-28T15:31:38  <Justin_o> that makes sense.. I think I've mentioned it in the tickets, so hopefully that covers the searches.

2020-09-28T17:04:28  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks
2020-09-28T17:04:34  <greatislander> (by which I mean myself and gtirloni)
2020-09-28T17:08:06  <colinclark> awesome, i’ll be there in a sec
2020-09-28T17:08:08  <colinclark> sorry for the delay

2020-09-28T17:51:34  <cindyli> Uttara: when you have time, can we have a call to look at the size of tile images on the wecount site home page?
2020-09-28T18:05:33  <Uttara> Hi cindyli: can we do it at 3? just about to grab lunch n\
2020-09-28T18:06:07  <cindyli> sure, Uttara. ping me when you are ready. thanks
2020-09-28T18:10:10  <greatislander> Justin_o: meant to follow up on your question from standup. My intention was only to process site-specific JavaScript as the Infusion/UIO package is copied over in its minified form. Let me know if you think that makes sense
2020-09-28T18:10:13  <cindyli> oh, btw, Uttara, the position change can be seen here - https://deploy-preview-412--wecount.netlify.app/. if they look good, just let me know. I will merge. If it needs furthur adjustments, we can have a call to adjust it together
2020-09-28T18:11:18  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks.. what about initialization and configuration code for adding UIO to the site. This probably limited enough that it shouldn't be affected much/at all.
2020-09-28T18:14:30  <greatislander> yeah, that would be processed.
2020-09-28T18:28:35  <greatislander> hi jhung, is there anything we should check in about today?
2020-09-28T18:29:25  <jhung> greatislander nothing today. I'm focusing on IUI today. Let's checkin tomorrow morning about the crit?
2020-09-28T18:29:33  <greatislander> sounds great.
2020-09-28T19:02:53  <Uttara> cindyli: actually they look just perfect! :)
2020-09-28T19:04:15  <cindyli> cool. thank, Uttara. there's another deploy preview for fixing the size of badge images - https://deploy-preview-414--wecount.netlify.app/badges/. let me know if they look good enough or you'd like some further adjustments?
2020-09-28T19:04:49  <Uttara> cindyli: these also look good to me. I will also send them along to Vera and David to view
2020-09-28T19:05:19  <cindyli> ok. thanks, Uttara. Let me know…
2020-09-28T20:22:17  <Uttara> hi cindyli: can we meet? I have some updates from Vera
2020-09-28T20:23:20  <Uttara> actually can we do tomorrow? I might wanna change some things in workpress before cindyli
2020-09-28T20:23:33  <cindyli> sure, Uttara
