2020-01-23T16:53:51  <greatislander> danielcho you mentioned disabling controls behind modals — I'm curious what method you're using?
2020-01-23T17:00:45  <danielcho> greatislander: I used two different method to disabling controls, depends on type of buttons we are using: — first case is disabling buttons those are just html buttons, which I used disabled property to the buttons, and the second case is disabling custom button components those have aria-disabled property, which I used logic to set tabIndex='-1' to disable the buttons
2020-01-23T17:01:44  <greatislander> cool. I encountered this recently— thought it might be of interest: https://github.com/WICG/inert
2020-01-23T17:02:19  <danielcho> Simon implemented the custom button with aria-disabled, because there are buttons we want to make focusable even when the buttons are disabled
2020-01-23T17:02:54  <danielcho> thanks, I will take a look after :)
2020-01-23T17:05:22  <greatislander> cool :)
2020-01-23T17:05:57  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo erictheise jhung michelled Co-op check in? I would like to make a cup of tea first.
2020-01-23T17:06:38  <danayo> perfect, I’ll make coffee :)
2020-01-23T17:07:13  <cherylhjli> sure
2020-01-23T17:09:14  <erictheise> I actually need to duck out soon for an appt at the frida kahlo house.

2020-01-23T17:12:42  <simonjb> thanks greatislander, I didn't know about the inert attribute
2020-01-23T17:13:10  <simonjb> it looks like Chrome, and related browsers, have support https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_htmlelement_inert

2020-01-23T17:14:20  <simonjb> greatislander: do you know how the polyfill is implemented?
2020-01-23T17:16:12  <greatislander> simonjb I believe it uses tabindex and some other things

2020-01-23T17:22:39  <simonjb> danielcho, michelled: I'm thinking what I will do is to write up a jira issue documenting the Node 12 Window 10 issues, but not investigate it too far at this point. Reasonable?
2020-01-23T17:23:02  <simonjb> danielcho: am I correct in thinking that you are running Node 10 on Mac?
2020-01-23T17:23:19  <danielcho> simonjb: yep
2020-01-23T17:23:23  <danielcho> that's correct
2020-01-23T17:23:28  <simonjb> thanks
2020-01-23T17:23:43  <Justin_o> simonjb: as a quick test, have you tried expanding the GitHub Actions to also test on windows and Mac?

2020-01-23T17:37:37  <michelled> sounds reasonable simonjb
2020-01-23T17:44:28  <simonjb> michelled: I'll write up a jira and make a branch that expands the CI build to build on Windows and Mac. That will show if the issue is specific to my computer. One factor that could raise the urgency of addressing this is that Node 12 is now the default offered at download. So if potential contributors are downloading the default Node version, C2LC will fail to build. But we don't have
2020-01-23T17:44:28  <simonjb> external developers (yet).
2020-01-23T17:45:05  <michelled> true, but good to be on top of this
2020-01-23T17:45:23  <michelled> and it's a good time right now as we wait for 0.3 and 0.5 designs
2020-01-23T17:45:35  <simonjb> true
