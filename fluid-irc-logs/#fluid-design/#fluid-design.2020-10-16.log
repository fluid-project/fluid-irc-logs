2020-10-16T14:50:45  <sepidehshahi> Hi cherylhjli re: AinA one pager, do you want me to directly edit or leave comments?
2020-10-16T14:51:36  <cherylhjli> please directly edit! thanks sepidehshahi!
2020-10-16T14:52:24  <sepidehshahi> sure, I can also start a new page at the end and write there and you can take anything that’s good from there
2020-10-16T15:54:16  <cherylhjli1> colinclark sepidehshahi - do we need a check in on the one pager, or are you folks still writing?
2020-10-16T15:54:23  <cherylhjli1> AinA one-pager *
2020-10-16T15:54:37  <colinclark> I’ve been in meetings all morning, just starting to look now
2020-10-16T15:54:41  <colinclark> happy to talk if that’s helpful
2020-10-16T15:57:38  <colinclark> cherylhjli1: on another note, there’s quite an interesting note from Emma Back on the platform co-op mailing list about cooperative governance
2020-10-16T15:57:56  <sepidehshahi> I’m stillwriting cherylhjli1 can I have another 30 min?
2020-10-16T15:58:04  <cherylhjli1> yeah for sure sepidehshahi!
2020-10-16T15:58:32  <cherylhjli1> honestly colinclark I just dumped a bunch of stuff in there - it'd be so helpful to have you take a good scrub at it, feel free to keep what is good and take out what doesn't feel right for now
2020-10-16T15:58:50  <colinclark> ok
2020-10-16T15:59:05  <colinclark> I think this is a case where we’ll have to write to our audience
2020-10-16T15:59:10  <colinclark> these aren’t tech or design people at all
2020-10-16T16:28:42  *** jhung is now known as jhung_mtg
2020-10-16T16:33:06  <sepidehshahi> cherylhjli1: and colinclark I’m running out of ideas now and ready to talk :)
2020-10-16T16:35:28  <cherylhjli1> i'm good to chat! colinclark?
2020-10-16T16:48:31  *** jhung_mtg is now known as jhung
2020-10-16T16:53:51  <colinclark> I’m available now, yes
2020-10-16T16:54:51  <colinclark> should i share a zoom link, sepidehshahi and cherylhjli1?
2020-10-16T16:55:13  <cherylhjli1> sure thanks colinclark!
2020-10-16T16:55:41  <colinclark> https://ocadu.zoom.us/j/87673420376
2020-10-16T16:56:21  <colinclark> looks like sepi is still writing :)
2020-10-16T17:56:01  <colinclark> cherylhjli1, sepidehshahi: Amazingly, even that Platform Design Toolkit never defines what a platform is
2020-10-16T17:56:05  <colinclark> they even have a glossary
2020-10-16T17:56:16  <colinclark> with definitions like this:
2020-10-16T17:56:18  <colinclark> Platform (strategy)​ ​— a strategy, run by a "platform shaper" that wants to mobilize and help an ecosystem in creating value, with the aim of capturing part of this value. A platform strategy is made of a combination of different elements: narrative, technologies, rules, channels, contexts, enabling services, protocols and more.
2020-10-16T17:56:31  <colinclark> but they never seem to address “what’s a platform?”
2020-10-16T18:00:16  <cherylhjli1> that's a lotta jargon!
2020-10-16T18:04:06  <colinclark> yeah, whole lotta jargon
2020-10-16T18:04:20  <colinclark> it’s pretty off-putting
2020-10-16T18:04:42  <colinclark> also why hasn’t the Platform Co-op Directory been made public by Cooper Systems yet?
2020-10-16T18:04:46  <colinclark> I would have liked to share a link to it
2020-10-16T18:05:18  <colinclark> amazingly, i think Trebor’s definition of a platform may be my best starting point for this
2020-10-16T18:05:25  <colinclark> “A platform is an online application or website used by individuals or groups to connect to one another or to organize services. “
2020-10-16T18:29:56  <cherylhjli1> sepidehshahi + colinclark, what do you think of providing examples of full co-design sessions, in addition to what we already have, which are examples of activities themselves? I dropped the blog I wrote about CoRise, and sepideh it looks like you have tons for inclusive cities
2020-10-16T18:35:54  <sepidehshahi> cherylhjli1: sure
2020-10-16T18:36:26  <cherylhjli1> I popped one in the doc, but sepideh please pick whichever entry you think is appropriate
2020-10-16T18:40:12  <colinclark> This is starting to look really good
2020-10-16T18:40:19  <colinclark> Katie is asking if she can send something at 4 pm today
2020-10-16T18:40:28  <colinclark> which normally I’d lol, but we did say we’d timebox it
2020-10-16T18:40:35  <cherylhjli1> hahah
2020-10-16T18:40:39  <cherylhjli1> I think we can do it
2020-10-16T18:40:43  <colinclark> cherylhjli1, sepidehshahi: Do we want to talk for two minutes?
2020-10-16T18:40:57  <colinclark> i’ve got my next meeting in 20 minutes, so now’s a good time for me
2020-10-16T18:41:10  <colinclark> (two minutes should be all we need)
2020-10-16T18:47:23  <cherylhjli1> sure thing
2020-10-16T18:47:28  <cherylhjli1> same link as before?
2020-10-16T18:48:06  <colinclark> yup
2020-10-16T18:48:15  <colinclark> sepidehshahi, cherylhjli1 ^
2020-10-16T19:24:22  <cherylhjli1> colinclark: sepideh and I got it down to just over 2 pages - sending now!
2020-10-16T19:24:54  <sepidehshahi> cherylhjli1: we didn’t fix the headings
2020-10-16T19:30:08  <cherylhjli1> I can make them the right headings!
