2020-06-18T16:59:03  <carenwatkins_> Hi jhung are you still good for 1? Skype?
2020-06-18T16:59:33  <jhung> carenwatkins_ yep. Skype. Give me 5 mins? I'll ping you
2020-06-18T17:56:09  <carenwatkins_> jhung: I found my password :-). I've made the change and it seems I can commit directly to the master branch. Should I still choose to do it as a pull request at this stage?
2020-06-18T17:57:01  <jhung> carenwatkins_ Yeah. Make a pull request for it still.
2020-06-18T17:57:21  <carenwatkins_> thumbs up jhung
2020-06-18T18:39:47  <carenwatkins_> jhung: jhung_2 I've made 4 changes in one document and sent out a pull request...I fear I may have previously committed changes due to some challenges with the interface I was having. Let me know if you receive a pull request email.
2020-06-18T18:44:45  <jhung_2> carenwatkins_ I looks like you made a commit to your own copy, and also made a pull request to your own copy. This is all okay. I can review the pull request in your copy, but we'd have to make another pull request to the main version once you're done.
2020-06-18T18:44:51  <jhung_2> *it
2020-06-18T18:44:55  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-06-18T18:45:59  <carenwatkins_> Ah, ok. Can I copy the file over to the main version once you've reviewed my copy?
2020-06-18T18:46:45  <jhung> carenwatkins_ only you can do that. What you need to do now is merge this Pull Request: https://github.com/carenwatkins/docs-inclusive-learning/pull/1
2020-06-18T18:46:55  <jhung> Then I'll tell you the next step after that
2020-06-18T18:47:48  <carenwatkins_> ok, I've confirmed the merge jhung
2020-06-18T18:48:18  <jhung> carenwatkins_ want to hope on skype for the next part?
2020-06-18T18:48:27  <carenwatkins_> Please!
2020-06-18T18:48:43  <jhung> ok logging on
2020-06-18T19:32:17  <cindyli> Justin_o: are you available for the wecount meeting?
2020-06-18T19:36:03  <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry, I'm there now
2020-06-18T19:36:16  <cindyli> thanks
2020-06-18T20:01:15  <danayo> gmoss: is this js file what I should be editing? https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/src/server/db/story-dbConfiguration.js
2020-06-18T20:02:45  <gmoss> danayo: yep that's the one! starting at line 4 is the "object" that represents the story, where you can see the type, heading and text for each block
2020-06-18T20:03:02  <gmoss> *40
2020-06-18T20:03:04  <gmoss> not 4 :)
2020-06-18T20:03:35  <gmoss> (well actually 38.. anwyay :))
2020-06-18T20:04:34  <danayo> thanks gmoss, it’s sort of just occurring to me that it’s not html :p
2020-06-18T20:04:51  <danayo> think I need some help with headings
2020-06-18T20:07:36  <gmoss> danayo: for sure! let me find a cheat sheet...
2020-06-18T20:07:53  <gmoss> though if it's the same headings that are in there now, just adding a new block and filling in the heading field will do
2020-06-18T20:08:21  <gmoss> danayo: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
2020-06-18T20:08:40  <danayo> I added nested headings gmoss
2020-06-18T20:08:43  <danayo> to a few of the sections
2020-06-18T20:09:16  <gmoss> danayo: gotcha. Those you can do with hashmarks. # = h1, ## = h2, ### = h3 and so on, making sure to leave a single space for the heading text after the ###
2020-06-18T20:09:32  <gmoss> up to H6 I believe :)
2020-06-18T20:09:41  <danayo> gmoss, right now there is no heading level indicated, just "heading"
2020-06-18T20:10:04  <gmoss> oh, let me confirm what a block heading's level is, but I think h2
2020-06-18T20:10:04  <danayo> is that cuz they’re all H1?
2020-06-18T20:10:30  <gmoss> they are all h3, i stand corrected
2020-06-18T20:11:02  <gmoss> danayo: oh, right. the "\n" you'll see here and there is a new line
2020-06-18T20:11:37  <gmoss> If you'd like to run a few things by me in a call, just let me know
2020-06-18T20:24:18  <carenwatkins_> jhung: is this correct: I can only make a branch of a page once I've made changes and commit those changes by selecting the "new branch" radio button in the commit changes dialogue area? OR can I branch before making changes?  :P
2020-06-18T20:25:02  <jhung> carenwatkins_ let me check.
2020-06-18T20:26:55  <jhung> carenwatkins_ if you're editing the files directly from the Github site, a branch is created when you're ready to commit those changes. But if you want to make multiple changes to a single branch (this is the usual, preferred way), you would have to work "offline" by cloning your copy to your local computer and working from there.
2020-06-18T20:27:49  <carenwatkins_> OK! Got it, thank so much jhung
2020-06-18T20:27:58  <jhung> No problem carenwatkins_
2020-06-18T20:32:29  <carenwatkins_> You should receive a new email for the pull request jhung. Just finished it up and that's it for this week.
2020-06-18T20:33:28  <jhung> ok carenwatkins_ Will look for it.
2020-06-18T21:56:59  <greatislander> FYI, alanharnum, I've completed my work on https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/84 and it's now ready for a look.
