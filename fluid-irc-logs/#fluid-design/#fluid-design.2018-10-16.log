2018-10-16T17:04:13  <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - I've just rolled 3.0.0-dev.20181016T162126Z.b1a1d8e8d from the current state of Infusion master
2018-10-16T17:04:28  <Bosmon> Please update for anyone who is interested
2018-10-16T17:05:06  <Bosmon> I'm imagining that this will be one of the last couple of releases before the big merge of https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/824
2018-10-16T17:08:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  Do you think the big merge will affect UIO+ much?
2018-10-16T17:08:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it oughtn't to, but you should definitely do a test
2018-10-16T17:09:00  <Bosmon> I did have to adjust the tests for the prefs framework a bit in my branch
2018-10-16T17:09:09  <Bosmon> I think for the Orator, where they needed to be de-sinonified a bit
2018-10-16T17:09:19  <Justin_o> oh
2018-10-16T17:09:22  <Bosmon> Since it is no longer possible to intercept the construction of invokers, and one shouldn't really try
2018-10-16T17:09:30  <Justin_o> ah okay
2018-10-16T17:09:57  <Bosmon> I converted the things which needed to be stubbed into events and just added the traditional "recording listeners" that we use elsewhere
2018-10-16T17:11:20  <Justin_o> okay.. i don't remember if i didn't anything like that in UIO+ ðŸ¤ž
2018-10-16T17:11:53  <Bosmon> The other areas of major incompatibility are i) code which introspects on options.components, ii) code which relies on components which are listed as createOnEvent to be fully constructed at the point their listener fires
2018-10-16T17:12:09  *** carenwatkins__ <carenwatkins__!~carenwatk@2607:fea8:13e0:872:90bf:3bba:9e9a:7eac> has joined #fluid-design
2018-10-16T17:12:32  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf had a couple of examples of i) in his code
2018-10-16T17:12:38  <Bosmon> And the GPII and prefs framework had one example each of ii)
2018-10-16T17:14:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  for ii) you mean if i listen to the same event that the createOnEvent was using?
2018-10-16T17:14:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2018-10-16T17:14:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so now you just wait on the onCreate event for that subcomponent instead?
2018-10-16T17:14:58  <Bosmon> In rare cases, people would add a further listener to the same event, and expect it to be already constructed by that point
2018-10-16T17:15:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that's certainly one way

2018-10-16T17:15:43  <Justin_o> okay... seems like the changes are straight forward enough, at least in theory.
2018-10-16T17:16:05  <Bosmon> Although increasingly we'll encourage people to use the new "workflow" features for this purpose - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/136/files#diff-0c099a4c200e7727078bf30288a73f01R223
2018-10-16T17:16:08  <carenwatkins_> Hi sepidehshahi Do you have time to chat today about your learning around co-designing a co-design session?
2018-10-16T17:16:15  <cindyli> Justin_o: another example - https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/47e53b95ca4e1e8b48b1a47009ba1eaa47316165#diff-2a48866aecf7478e0d32381b8179c327R54
2018-10-16T17:16:25  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it should usually be pretty easy to have code which is compatible with the old framework and the new, with a couple of minor tweaks
2018-10-16T17:17:29  <Bosmon> This was the purpose of the tweak which cindyli just committed to universal - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/687/files#diff-2a48866aecf7478e0d32381b8179c327R91
2018-10-16T17:19:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: does this solve the issue where we want to use an invoker within another invoker but it hasn't resolved yet so we have to refer to it in the arguments.. example function (that) {that.someInvoker()}
2018-10-16T17:20:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in general, no
2018-10-16T17:20:33  <Bosmon> If you make use of any part of another component during construct time, in general you will need to force it to resolve with a reference
2018-10-16T17:21:04  <Bosmon> But construct time is now ordered a lot better than before, for example with the important ability to expect that the "init" model event definitely happens before "onCreate" for every component
