2019-09-11T16:43:00  <colinclark> oh yes, the Skoog
2019-09-11T16:43:06  <colinclark> I met the CEO of the company years ago
2019-09-11T16:43:17  <simonjb> avtar: they were at ISTE also
2019-09-11T16:43:38  <simonjb> they were at Wonder Workshop's booth
2019-09-11T16:43:47  <simonjb> it's neat
2019-09-11T16:43:50  <colinclark> Also a technologist who worked for Drake Music building adaptive instruments
2019-09-11T16:44:20  <colinclark> the one thing Gowain said about the Skoog that was interesting is that it’s soft
2019-09-11T16:44:27  <colinclark> so it tends to be something that gets chewed on :) :)
2019-09-11T16:45:20  <avtar> oh boy

2019-09-11T17:43:02  <Justin_o> jhung: I'm talking with gmoss and lliskovoi and we have a topic for the Design Crit. We'd like to talk about notifications for content changes. and perhaps notifications in general.
2019-09-11T17:49:06  <jhung> Justin_o Sure. When were you thinking? Next week?
2019-09-11T18:02:53  *** danayo_ <danayo_!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-design
2019-09-11T18:09:53  <Justin_o> jhung: yes, I think next week would work
2019-09-11T18:12:10  <jhung> Justin_o ok. So the crit is to talk about techniques for managing notifications. This includes alerts, new messages, form validation and stuff like that?
2019-09-11T18:12:44  <jhung> Or is it notifications about changes in dynamic content like a chat, carousel, etc?
2019-09-11T18:13:07  <Justin_o> I guess more like the former
2019-09-11T18:13:15  <jhung> ok
2019-09-11T18:13:18  <Justin_o> the concrete example is here https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-281
2019-09-11T18:13:22  <gmoss> well it's a little bit of both
2019-09-11T18:13:51  <gmoss> as blocks are added to and removed from the storytelling tool, we'd like to provide meaningful feedback to the user that a thing has happened
2019-09-11T18:14:06  <jhung> ok
2019-09-11T18:15:46  <gmoss> Justin_o: since we're planning to (temporarily, anyway) remove the transcript from the video and audio block types, the simplifiedText input from the text block serves a similar purpose
2019-09-11T18:15:52  <gmoss> aka the summary
2019-09-11T18:16:03  <gmoss> it's simply rendered immediately after the regular text content
2019-09-11T18:16:22  <gmoss> do you think it would be reasonable to remove that as well?

2019-09-11T18:17:35  <Justin_o> gmoss: does it get styled differently and put into a special container?
2019-09-11T18:17:54  <gmoss> Justin_o: no
2019-09-11T18:17:58  <gmoss> not currently, anyway
2019-09-11T18:18:01  <gmoss> it looks the same
2019-09-11T18:18:06  <gmoss> there was a dream, once :)
2019-09-11T18:18:14  <Justin_o> haha
2019-09-11T18:18:18  <Justin_o> yah, probably okay to remove.
2019-09-11T18:18:34  <gmoss> okay, I'll do that as well
2019-09-11T18:19:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: there were many things that we added and have been captured without any solid designs to determine what we'd do with them. I think if we're just putting them out in the page in the same style as other content, they may only serve to confuse users

2019-09-11T18:28:24  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, that's possible. if they can't distinguish them when the story is rendered, it seems like it would cause confusion.
2019-09-11T18:29:15  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm trying to look into the issue cindyli saw in SJRK-274 with the position of the play button. If I can't figure it out soon, I'll look into just disabling that part.
2019-09-11T18:29:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: that sounds reasonable
2019-09-11T18:29:53  <gmoss> Justin_o: with that part disabled, the tool would have exactly the functionality that it currently has anyway
2019-09-11T18:30:24  <Justin_o> gmoss: pretty much.. just a few difference but the same idea anyways.
2019-09-11T18:31:02  <Justin_o> gmoss: so the button in the control can play/pause. It won't restart until you finish playing. Or you could reload the page and start again. It will also highlight the text as it reads.
2019-09-11T18:32:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: right, so it's an improvement
2019-09-11T18:32:31  <gmoss> even if the select-and-play isn't an option
2019-09-11T18:33:23  <gmoss> my use of the word "exactly" was misleading :P what I meant was that it would be a superset of the current functionality
2019-09-11T18:35:36  <Justin_o> gmoss: well it's a bit different.. in the previous case it would restart from the beginning if you hit the play button again. so for anyone who wants that behaviour you'll have to restart or let it play through.. just something to be aware of as it may come up tomorrow
2019-09-11T18:36:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: fair enough

2019-09-11T18:52:33  <Justin_o> gmoss: I think the positioning issue in SJRK-274 is related to some of the relative positioning. But I don't think I'm going to have time to sort all those parts out, so I'm just going to disable that feature. I think later we could probably come back and sort things out.
2019-09-11T18:53:08  <gmoss> Justin_o: that sounds good. I think we should add a comment on the Jira or edit the description of it
2019-09-11T18:53:13  <gmoss> so we don't lose track of this
