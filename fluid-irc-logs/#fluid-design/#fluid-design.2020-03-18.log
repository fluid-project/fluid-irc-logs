2020-03-18T14:12:19  <michelled1> great, let's use the coding room
2020-03-18T14:16:27  <cindyli> greatislander: some wordpress APIs returns "x-wp-totalpages" in response headers. these APIs include /tags, /posts, /categories, /posts?categories=1 etc. as long as this "x-wp-totalpages" is returned, can i always use "?page={pageNum}" to fetch the data for a particular page and each page will contain a maximum of 10 records?

2020-03-18T14:34:58  <greatislander> hi cindyli, that's correct. the other option is that you can add a `per_page` parameter (any integer up to 100) and each page will contain that number

2020-03-18T14:35:57  <cindyli> great. thanks, greatislander
