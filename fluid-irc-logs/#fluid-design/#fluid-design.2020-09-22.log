2020-09-22T18:02:06  <Justin_o> greatislander: are you free to chat now about UIO?
2020-09-22T18:05:55  <greatislander> yep!
2020-09-22T18:06:04  <Justin_o> greatislander: standup?
2020-09-22T18:06:07  <greatislander> sure

2020-09-22T18:42:16  <Justin_o> greatislander: I just remembered I filed a JIRA about browser list before https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6479
2020-09-22T18:51:02  <greatislander> ah cool!
2020-09-22T18:55:39  <greatislander> the plot thickens, justin_o
2020-09-22T18:56:08  <greatislander> I think there's some prefs editor specific styles for the switch control
2020-09-22T18:56:37  <greatislander> actually it imports the stylus file
2020-09-22T18:57:34  <Justin_o> greatislander: I wonder if that's really necessary. I guess it's just a convenience, but might mean we add the styles to the page twice
2020-09-22T18:57:46  <greatislander> yeah, I'm going to see if it is
2020-09-22T18:57:49  <greatislander> I suspect not?
2020-09-22T18:57:58  <Justin_o> thanks for tracking all this down
2020-09-22T18:58:24  <Justin_o> greatislander: you might need to update the CSS imports for the HTML I guess.
2020-09-22T19:00:34  <greatislander> yeah
2020-09-22T19:01:21  <greatislander> michelled jhung colinclark where shall we meet?
2020-09-22T19:01:41  <michelled> connections room?
2020-09-22T19:01:56  <greatislander> sure!
2020-09-22T19:02:06  <colinclark> ok, be there in a sec
2020-09-22T19:02:11  <colinclark> sorry for the delay
2020-09-22T19:02:21  <jhung> Which one is the "connections room"?
2020-09-22T19:02:37  <michelled> standup :)
2020-09-22T19:37:07  <greatislander> hey Justin_o, I think it's good to go now
2020-09-22T19:37:24  <greatislander> I am opening the follow-up JIRA about contrast theme styles in individual components and will add a link to the PR momentarily
2020-09-22T19:38:41  <colinclark> hey cherylhjli, danayo, do either of you know any freelance web designer/developers who are interested in working with non-profit arts organizations?
2020-09-22T19:39:27  <colinclark> I’ve had a few groups contact me interested in working with us, but I didn’t feel like we had capacity to do development
2020-09-22T19:39:40  <colinclark> as opposed to helping with advice, co-design support, and accessibility review etc., which I think we can always help with
2020-09-22T19:42:04  <danayo> colinclark: I can’t think of any off the top of my head but am poking around
2020-09-22T19:42:19  <colinclark> thank you!
2020-09-22T19:49:41  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o, can you grant me permissions to label issues, merge etc on this repo? I'm going to be doing some work on the FLOE Project site over the next couple weeks. https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/
2020-09-22T20:31:54  <jhung> Justin_o I added greatislander now as a Maintainer on floeproject.org. He shows up as an "outside collaborator" though. We can take a look at this tomorrow.
