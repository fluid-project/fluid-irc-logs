2019-06-20T20:43:39  <danayo> cherylhjli: I'm thinking about how this object-oriented UX design process could be turned into a co-design activity somehow ...
2019-06-20T20:44:30  <cherylhjli> :O
2019-06-20T20:44:33  <cherylhjli> that woudl be super cool danayo!!
2019-06-20T20:46:02  <cherylhjli> I definitely think that's doable, we can start by making the language around it a little less technical
2019-06-20T20:46:10  <cherylhjli> are you thinking of this for the co-design with our partners?
2019-06-20T20:47:19  <danayo> not necessarily cherylhjli - was just thinking in general, as I read through it, since it starts with user research and personas I was thinking how it could be transformed into the co-design process
2019-06-20T20:48:34  <cherylhjli> yeah, I think sequentially this would make a lot of sense after a concept is more defined - this seems to be good at shaping out the pieces of a concept
