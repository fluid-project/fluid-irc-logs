2019-05-15T14:18:40  <alanharnum> colinclark: I remember we were talking about Don Norman a few months back - this was just published in fast company: https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me
2019-05-15T14:18:53  <alanharnum> mentions Kat Holmes' inclusive design book, among other things
2019-05-15T14:19:09  <colinclark> yeah
2019-05-15T14:19:14  <colinclark> i saw that
2019-05-15T14:19:25  <colinclark> it’s all very interesting
2019-05-15T14:19:30  <colinclark> and a bit ambivalent-feeling
2019-05-15T14:19:52  <alanharnum> yes
2019-05-15T14:21:22  <alanharnum> It feels like, among other things, some lack of reckoning with his own role (and the Nielsen-Norman Group's role) in history of UX design in the last two decades, which has arguably contributed to exactly these circumstances with the emphasis on statistical testing, lack of interest in customization because it's "complex", etc
2019-05-15T14:22:54  <colinclark> yes
2019-05-15T14:23:12  <colinclark> it is interesting how aging changes one’s perspective, too
2019-05-15T14:23:20  <alanharnum> it's maybe too harsh a take, but I feel like NNG played a major role in popularizing methods of testing and design that treated outliers and edge cases as something to be dismissed and ignored
2019-05-15T14:23:28  <colinclark> yes, I agree
2019-05-15T14:24:23  <alanharnum> yeah - to a certain extent it reads like  a latecoming to awareness because of no longer being the target audience of the mainstream design methods he did a lot to systematize and popularize
2019-05-15T14:25:26  <alanharnum> i am glad it's being written, but i share the ambivalence

2019-05-15T18:24:21  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: looks like we won't have a tonne of time before the Community Meeting today. Here's my update since yesterday's ST planning: have been working on some of the features that are independent of the design, like adding the workshops page and researching how to implement pull quotes in an easy and accessible way
2019-05-15T18:25:25  <michelled> sounds good gmoss

2019-05-15T18:34:33  <michelled> caren: did you decide on which design you're going with? I realize with the long weekend we've only got around 6 days to implement

2019-05-15T20:06:55  <gmoss> it's helpful to have the back-and-forth about what's easiest to program, etc.
2019-05-15T20:07:23  <michelled> great!
