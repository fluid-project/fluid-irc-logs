2019-12-11T14:36:03  <simonjb> hi sepidehshahi, we've added the Start indicator to C2LC: https://c2lc-dev.web.app/
2019-12-11T14:36:24  <simonjb> right now we show at least 6 steps -- should we reduce to 4 maybe?
2019-12-11T14:36:53  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: I was just playing with the environment. It looks great!
2019-12-11T14:37:19  <sepidehshahi> the start indicator is great and I think we should keep the 6 steps as it shows you can scroll and add more
2019-12-11T14:37:36  <simonjb> cool, thanks! will leave as is

2019-12-11T14:42:52  <avtar> simonjb: np
2019-12-11T14:43:03  <simonjb> we have a task to add the current active step as the program is running -- the last screen in Sepi's design
2019-12-11T14:43:15  <simonjb> but it won't be changing focus
2019-12-11T14:43:31  <avtar> ah ok
2019-12-11T14:43:35  <danielcho> avtar: sepidehshahi oh, dash moves about 19.5cm on forward
2019-12-11T14:43:58  <avtar> thanks for confirming
2019-12-11T14:44:11  <danielcho> np :)
2019-12-11T14:44:24  <sepidehshahi> thanks danielcho
2019-12-11T14:44:58  <danielcho> üëç
2019-12-11T14:45:00  <sepidehshahi> danielcho did you have a chance to try the updated add icon?
2019-12-11T14:45:25  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: it's on the dev site
2019-12-11T14:45:27  <simonjb> https://c2lc-dev.web.app/
2019-12-11T14:45:28  <danielcho> oh yeah, the add icon is being used on the live one
2019-12-11T14:45:37  <danielcho> ^
2019-12-11T14:46:34  <sepidehshahi> add and delete still look different on the live site, maybe I should export them in a different way
2019-12-11T14:46:51  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: ^
2019-12-11T14:47:51  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: could you maybe take a screenshot or export as a bitmap of some type so I can see? and then we can figure out how to get to look like what you would like?
2019-12-11T14:48:26  <sepidehshahi> for sure
2019-12-11T14:48:30  <simonjb> thanks!

2019-12-11T19:04:26  <danayo> oh and our roadmap planning on Monday

2019-12-11T19:13:59  <jhung> would that work for you greatislander, danayo, cherylhjli ?
2019-12-11T19:14:18  <danayo> yep jhung
2019-12-11T19:14:55  <greatislander> michelled wouldn't 2pm ET conflict with the PCC checkin?
