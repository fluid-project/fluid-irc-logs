2020-07-17T19:36:43  <cindyli> Teddy___: regarding your new pull request https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/334, did you get the new design for it?
2020-07-17T19:37:42  <Teddy___> Yup Uttara: confirmed the design is ready
2020-07-17T19:38:14  <Teddy___> Copied what is currently on figa
2020-07-17T19:38:18  <Teddy___> figma*
2020-07-17T19:39:06  <cindyli> oh, i think Uttara and Lisa will comment on the ticket (https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/322) with a list of changed items. It's hard to go thru every page to find all font size changes
2020-07-17T19:39:39  <Teddy___> Okay
2020-07-17T19:40:11  <Uttara> Cindyli, Teddy__ yes I will upload the comments on github. Just finishing up with lunch. I will ping you once that is done
2020-07-17T19:41:50  <cindyli> cool. thanks, Uttara
2020-07-17T20:01:47  <Uttara> Cindyli, Teddy__ : I have added comments and screenshots under that issue. Can you please have a look and let me know if anything is missing?
2020-07-17T20:02:08  <cindyli> sure. thanks, Uttara
2020-07-17T20:10:16  <cindyli> Uttara: in these comments, you used a combination of "pt" and "em", for example: 18pt/1em. our current base font size for wecount site is 16px. do you mean to change the base font size to 18pt which is an equivalent to 13.5px?
2020-07-17T20:11:11  <Uttara> Cindyli: yes. We decided to change the mobile base font to 14, and the desktop one to 18
2020-07-17T20:11:13  <cindyli> looking at the figma, the unit used there are "18px" for the article body text
2020-07-17T20:11:37  <cindyli> Uttara: you mean 18px right? not "pt"
2020-07-17T20:11:44  <cindyli> they are 2 different units
2020-07-17T20:13:40  <cindyli> Uttara: moreover, the current base font for desktop is 16px. changing it to 18px will increase the font size. is that what you want?
2020-07-17T20:14:50  <cindyli> can we sync up the unit to use "px". it's confusing to have different units
2020-07-17T20:38:49  <Uttara> @cindyli: yes you are correct. increasing it for desktop and decreasing for mobile
2020-07-17T20:41:43  <Uttara> @cidnyli: yes syncing the units in figma to pixel
