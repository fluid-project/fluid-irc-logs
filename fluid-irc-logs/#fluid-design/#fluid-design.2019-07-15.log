2019-07-15T16:46:52  <danayo_> cherylhjli, greatislander did either of you take any notes during our sketch sharing/discussion about the dashboard/labour platform? I thought I did, but can’t seem to find anything. Was interested particularly in the more tech side of the discussion about pulling data from different places/apps - something I think we can discuss with CoRise today
2019-07-15T16:47:38  <greatislander> danayo_ I did not, sorry! But I can write something up
2019-07-15T16:47:45  <greatislander> Or share my thoughts on the call
2019-07-15T16:48:22  <cherylhjli> sorry danayo_ I did not! :(
2019-07-15T16:50:32  <danayo_> no worries thanks cherylhjli greatislander - will take some notes during the call today and then if we need to discuss further we can!

2019-07-15T19:10:40  <Justin_o> jhung: hmm.. let me know think.. in general want to check in on which of the new prefs framework features should be added as UIO preferences.
2019-07-15T19:11:32  <Justin_o> also I want to talk about some new CSS media features to see if they make sense to work into the prefs framework and if so in what way. prefers-color-scheme and prefers-reduced-motion
2019-07-15T19:12:01  <jhung> ok Justin_o.
2019-07-15T19:12:06  <Justin_o> let me see if I can write that up into something you can use as a description
2019-07-15T19:12:20  <jhung> thanks Justin_o
2019-07-15T19:16:55  <Justin_o> jhung: how does this sound?
2019-07-15T19:17:00  <Justin_o> Review new Prefs Framework and UIO+ preferences (letter spacing, word spacing, syllables, text-to-speech, simplify, captions, localization) to determine which should be added to the standard UIO configuration.
2019-07-15T19:17:00  <Justin_o> Discuss the “prefers-color-scheme” and “prefers-reduced-motion” CSS media features in relation to their use with the preferences framework.
2019-07-15T19:17:36  <jhung> Justin_o that sounds good. I'll send that out with the email. Thanks!
2019-07-15T19:17:57  <Justin_o> thanks
