2020-04-03T19:49:06  <erictheise> cherylhjli greatislander what is the general patter for displaying a warning from a link in Pinecone sites? I see the Notification->Warning markup but am not sure how it should make its presence known in the window.
2020-04-03T19:49:55  <cherylhjli> warning from a link? could you explain a bit more?
2020-04-03T19:50:07  <cherylhjli> what's the interaction that happens that triggers this warning?
2020-04-03T19:50:24  <erictheise> https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/issues/7#issuecomment-608531539
2020-04-03T20:25:44  <erictheise> I’ve figured something out that’ll work for now cherylhjli sorry for the interruption.
2020-04-03T20:26:09  <cherylhjli> ah sorry I didn't get the last message!
2020-04-03T20:26:39  <cherylhjli> ohh I see
2020-04-03T20:26:47  <cherylhjli> there's a modal pattern in pincone
2020-04-03T20:26:49  <cherylhjli> pinecone*
2020-04-03T20:27:13  <cherylhjli> I'm imagining dana's warning dialog will say something like "are you sure you want to leave this page?" or something like that
2020-04-03T20:27:19  <cherylhjli> sorry for the delay erictheise!
2020-04-03T20:27:34  <erictheise> np.
2020-04-03T20:28:57  <erictheise> it’s not the text i know that will come later, it’s whether it pops a modal or expands below the link or… want to implment whatever the Pinecone way is.

2020-04-03T20:42:31  <cherylhjli> I think a modal would be a good fit for the interaction, since modals tend to be used for a "full stop" scenario where the user shouldn't be able to proceed without answering the question, which it sounds like is the case here
2020-04-03T20:52:44  <greatislander> erictheise for the dialog (modal), this is the way to implement it: https://pinecone.platform.coop/components/detail/dialog--default.html

2020-04-03T21:40:03  <cindyli> Teddy___: the "style page content" pull request is ready to be merged. regarding your comment - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/134#issuecomment-608680668, would it be a problem if I merge it before the "home page style" pull request?
2020-04-03T21:42:43  <Teddy___> I believe so
2020-04-03T21:43:14  <Teddy___> theres only one more thing that needs to be added to homepage style and that is the card hover styling
2020-04-03T21:43:31  <Teddy___> and then it will be ready to merge as well
2020-04-03T21:54:18  <cindyli> greatislander: "we should remove the test content in <Aside> component." - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/134
