2020-10-14T14:52:09  <greatislander> Hi Justin_o, I've been asked to start converting the ILDH site from Docpad to 11ty. Can you give me some GitHub permissions for that repo? (I think it needs to be added to the web team.)
2020-10-14T14:52:35  <Justin_o> greatislander: sure I'll take a look at that
2020-10-14T14:52:39  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-10-14T14:55:00  <Justin_o> greatislander, jhung: It seems that the ILDH repo is one where we should consider if the issues are tracked in GitHub Issues or JIRA. It  looks like there are a couple of issues in GitHub Issues, and others in JIRA at https://issues.fluidproject.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20FLOE%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Inclusive%20Design%20Guide%22
2020-10-14T14:55:44  <greatislander> Justin_o aren't those for guide.inclusivedesign.ca as opposed to handbook.floeproject.org?
2020-10-14T14:56:21  <greatislander> I could be wrong but it's not clear to me
2020-10-14T14:56:43  <greatislander> according to the GitHub repo for docs-inclusive-learning, the bugs link is https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID/component/10080/
2020-10-14T14:57:16  <greatislander> It's a broken link but if I filter by component 10080 I only get this one JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20FLUID%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%2010080%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC
2020-10-14T14:58:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: seems like there's lots of confusion. There's actually a whole project for the ILDH if I'm not confusing things https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/ILDH/issues/ILDH-36?filter=allopenissues
2020-10-14T14:58:23  <Justin_o> but seems that there were also issues filed under FLOE
2020-10-14T14:58:35  <Justin_o> you were also right about the other component type
2020-10-14T14:58:46  <greatislander> aha
2020-10-14T14:59:01  <greatislander> also some of these JIRAs are from 10 years ago so may not be relevant anymoreâ€¦
2020-10-14T14:59:41  <greatislander> (references to PRs in the archived MediaWiki repo: https://github.com/fluid-project/handbook.floeproject.org/) Justin_o
2020-10-14T14:59:42  <Justin_o> yes, definitely should be pruned
2020-10-14T15:00:26  <Justin_o> greatislander: depending on what the redesign is, all/most of these may be able to be closed off
2020-10-14T15:00:36  <greatislander> yep
2020-10-14T15:01:04  <greatislander> Right now I am going to focus on converting to 11ty and I will address FLOE-552 at the same time Justin_o
2020-10-14T15:01:12  <greatislander> (see: https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/pull/18)
2020-10-14T15:02:10  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-10-14T15:02:37  <Justin_o> greatislander: permissions have been updated
2020-10-14T15:02:41  <greatislander> thanks!

2020-10-14T18:15:46  <greatislander> Justin_o I'm not happy with how the 11ty.js templating approach to CSS/Sass/Stylus is working. I think it might be better to use webpack. If you are able to do so, can you do a final review of the JS processing PR? I'd like to get that merged and then expand the approach to handle stylesheets as well.
2020-10-14T18:16:13  <Justin_o> greatislander: actually just testing that out now and hoping to merge soon
2020-10-14T18:17:11  <greatislander> fantastic, thanks!
2020-10-14T18:33:33  <Justin_o> greatislander: merged https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/31
2020-10-14T18:35:42  <greatislander> awesome, thanks Justin_o
