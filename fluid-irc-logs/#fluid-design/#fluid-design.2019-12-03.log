2019-12-03T17:14:14  <danayo> sepidehshahi: you mean a proper calendar invite? (I sent an email confirming)
2019-12-03T17:14:52  <sepidehshahi> an email invite would be great and if you can generate a zoom link
2019-12-03T17:15:08  <danayo> sure sepidehshahi, what zoom room should we use?

2019-12-03T17:15:51  <sepidehshahi> I’m not familiar with zoom and how we use it at IDRC. do we have specific rooms we can use?
2019-12-03T17:16:12  <sepidehshahi> michelled: ^
2019-12-03T17:17:12  <danayo> sepidehshahi: I think there are a couple we can use - jhung, Justin_o ?

2019-12-03T17:49:10  <danayo> jhung: I’d like to schedule a zoom meeting for Bodies in Translation. I signed into my zoom account but I’m not sure if I can use a room other than my personal (40-min limit) room to schedule a meeting from my account?
2019-12-03T17:49:22  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.105> has joined #fluid-design
2019-12-03T17:53:46  <michelled> sepidehshahi: I'm not sure how we are supposed to use it either. I think jhung and Justin_o are working that out. I tried to create a standing zoom meeting for the c2lc project, but I'm not sure it's set up ok
2019-12-03T17:54:06  <michelled> it's in the calendar event for the daily c2lc meeting at 1:00
2019-12-03T17:54:36  <sepidehshahi> Let’s try it today michelled
2019-12-03T17:54:47  <michelled> sounds good!
2019-12-03T17:55:25  <Justin_o> michelled, sepidehshahi: we're still waiting on the zoom room account for the collaboration room. It seems it hasn't been setup properly yet. We'll have a better idea once we sort that part out. For now setting up standing meetings from our own accounts or one off meetings is probably the best we can do
2019-12-03T17:56:31  <danayo> Justin_o: is there any way for me to create a calendar invite through zoom, using a room other than  my personal room?
2019-12-03T17:56:58  <Justin_o> danayo: do you have a pro account?
2019-12-03T17:57:01  <danayo> no
2019-12-03T17:57:22  <Justin_o> danayo: sadly I don't think so then
2019-12-03T17:57:45  <danayo> michelled: how did you set up your standing meeting? using the ocad Zoom account you have?
2019-12-03T17:58:02  <michelled> yeah, that's what I tried to do
2019-12-03T17:58:08  <michelled> feel free to try danayo :)
2019-12-03T17:58:21  <Justin_o> danayo: you could try the instructions from here to see if they work for you https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214973206-Scheduling-Recurring-Meetings
2019-12-03T17:58:25  <danayo> you mean with your accoutn michelled ?
2019-12-03T17:58:39  <michelled> yes
2019-12-03T18:00:08  <jhung> sepidehshahi danayo I can set up a room for BiT similar to how we have it for Platform Coop. It's just a meeting that never ends. You have a Zoom URL that you can use and share.
2019-12-03T18:00:45  <sepidehshahi> that would be great! thanks jhung
2019-12-03T18:01:22  <danayo> thanks jhung
2019-12-03T18:02:22  <sepidehshahi> michelled: the zoom link worked. I’m in the meeting now if we have one today
2019-12-03T18:03:01  <michelled> simonjb, danielcho, avtar: want to check in?
2019-12-03T18:03:24  <avtar> michelled: yup, joining
2019-12-03T18:04:27  <jhung> sepidehshahi danayo - is there a recurring schedule for BiT meetings?
2019-12-03T18:04:39  <danayo> no jhung
2019-12-03T18:05:26  <jhung> ok. For now I will just put it as Tuesdays 3pm. But you can join that meeting any time you want. I'll email you the details shortly.
2019-12-03T18:06:14  <danielcho> michelled: sure
2019-12-03T18:06:20  <danielcho> on zoom?
2019-12-03T18:06:22  <michelled> danielcho: are you able to join us?
2019-12-03T18:06:23  <michelled> yes
2019-12-03T18:06:31  <danielcho> yep
2019-12-03T18:06:53  <danayo> ok thanks jhung, we’re going to meet at 1pm, but I guess like you said we can join any time
