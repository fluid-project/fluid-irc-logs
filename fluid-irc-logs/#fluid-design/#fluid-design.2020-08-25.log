2020-08-25T15:31:58  <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning will start soon
2020-08-25T16:30:32  <gmoss> danayo: are you available for Storytelling Tool check-in?
2020-08-25T16:30:50  <gmoss> perhaps it's worth waiting for michelled to return
2020-08-25T16:31:50  <danayo> gmoss it would be good to wait for michelled, however, I do have a meeting at 1
2020-08-25T16:32:14  <gmoss> danayo: hmm okay. I don't have anything else today, iirc, so if we'd like to meet later on, that's fine with me!
2020-08-25T16:32:18  <gmoss> or we can skip it today
2020-08-25T16:34:01  <danayo> ok gmoss, letâ€™s wait and see if michelled wants to meet today to catch up on where things are at, and if not we can do that tomorrow
2020-08-25T16:34:18  <gmoss> danayo: sounds like a plan :)

2020-08-25T16:40:34  <gmoss> would you like the honours of letting dogeman know in #fluid-work or would you prefer I do that?
2020-08-25T16:42:04  <gtirloni> go ahead :)
2020-08-25T20:09:35  <sbates> Sony work to identify users through how they hold/use a PlayStation controller: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/sony-could-detect-playstation-users-based-on-how-they-hold-a-controller/
2020-08-25T20:14:13  <gmoss> Very interesting idea! Equal parts fascinating and creepy
