2019-02-22T15:37:18  <sepidehshahi> Hi colinclark, do you think I should include Bridges logo on the post card?
2019-02-22T15:37:24  <colinclark> yes, I think so
2019-02-22T15:37:29  <sepidehshahi> great thanks
2019-02-22T15:37:30  <colinclark> it seems only fair
2019-02-22T15:37:36  <colinclark> sepidehshahi: My sister's advice was to flip the structure of the text
2019-02-22T15:37:37  <sepidehshahi> yes!
2019-02-22T15:38:03  <colinclark> so to put "Are you a parent, educator, or learner with a disability? We need your help to make coding education more inclusive for all kids" right at the beginning
2019-02-22T15:38:15  <colinclark> what are your thoughts?
2019-02-22T15:38:23  <colinclark> My brother-in-law, the principal loved it
2019-02-22T15:38:38  <colinclark> asked if we wanted to be more specific about types of disabilities, which I don't think we do yet
2019-02-22T15:38:53  <colinclark> and then invited us to be a judge in a grade 6 coding competition
2019-02-22T16:35:58  <sepidehshahi> colinclark: I really like your sister’s suggestion about changing the order!
2019-02-22T16:36:15  <colinclark> cool, i flipped it around in the wiki to see what it looks like
2019-02-22T16:36:19  <colinclark> so it's there if you need it
2019-02-22T16:37:02  <sepidehshahi> I think being judges for grade 6 coding competion will give and simonjb some idea about students and teachers challenges and tools used in school. So it’s a great opportunity!
2019-02-22T16:37:17  <sepidehshahi> awesome, thanks colinclark

2019-02-22T17:18:21  <simonjb> colinclark and sepidehshahi: I'll periodically update a GitHub pages deployment of my work-in-progress, so others can see it without needed to run the code locally https://simonbates.github.io/c2lc-exploratory/
2019-02-22T17:18:50  <sepidehshahi> that’s great simonjb
2019-02-22T17:18:52  <sepidehshahi> tanks
2019-02-22T17:18:56  <sepidehshahi> thanks
2019-02-22T17:18:56  <simonjb> my next work is to draw the 'turtle' and add a button to step throught the program
2019-02-22T17:19:25  <simonjb> through the program
2019-02-22T17:21:44  <colinclark> simonjb: nice work

2019-02-22T18:56:53  <colinclark> sepidehshahi: I raised the message size on the email list to 25 MB so that you won't have problems with messages needing to be moderated when you send images and stuff :)
2019-02-22T18:57:36  <sepidehshahi> thanks colinclark, michelled also changed the message size so hopefully you are not overwriting each others work :)
2019-02-22T18:57:45  <colinclark> oh
2019-02-22T18:57:53  <colinclark> it still looked to me like it was set at 2MB
2019-02-22T18:57:59  <colinclark> fascinating
2019-02-22T18:58:15  <sepidehshahi> 25 MB is great, before it was 40 kb
2019-02-22T18:59:25  <sepidehshahi> jhung: and lliskovoi, next Wednesday, we have a visit from the Beverley school that is exactly at the same time as the community meeting. Many of us should go to that meeting and miss the community meeting. I was wondering if it’s possible to change the date the community meeting with the National Farmers Coallition, or maybe move it to a design crit in the same week.

2019-02-22T19:01:03  <jhung> sepidehshahi: Jutta was going to share something at the crit this tuesday which might have an impact on vision / direction of some of our projects.
2019-02-22T19:02:24  <sepidehshahi> sure jhung, maybe we could move to the crit in the following week
2019-02-22T19:07:41  <jhung> Might want to talk to Lisa when she's back online about the National Farmers Coalition. Not sure how much they need and what the discussion is about sepidehshahi.

2019-02-22T19:59:44  <michelled> simonjb: we think you might be best positioned to fill in this card: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/Technology+Infrastructure+Environmental+Scan
2019-02-22T19:59:59  <michelled> I've just been making some placeholders so feel free to change what ever you want in it
2019-02-22T20:00:27  <colinclark> this is the card related to doing research on existing coding educational technology—like things we want to integrate with or approaches that are really promising
2019-02-22T20:01:15  <simonjb> cools, thanks michelled, colinclark
2019-02-22T20:02:43  <michelled> simonjb: we've got a card already related to coding environments: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/C2LC/Create+and+share+a+summary+of+the+accessibility+issues+and+strengths+of+existing+coding+environments

2019-02-22T20:10:40  <simonjb> yes sepidehshahi, when?
2019-02-22T20:10:51  <sepidehshahi> I’m available any time before 4:30
