2020-04-15T15:47:57  <danayo> gmoss, colinclark, michelled: I didn’t find any issues that are blockers to using the tool, but this issue worries me a bit, wondering what your thoughts are on it https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-307
2020-04-15T15:52:51  <michelled> danayo: I think it's an important thing to do, but if we tell people to only use a particular browser then i suppose we could let them use it still?
2020-04-15T15:52:58  <michelled> it's so much harder when everyone is remote
2020-04-15T15:53:10  <michelled> if we were in the same space, we could easily do this
2020-04-15T15:53:24  <danayo> right michelled - you mean it’s harder to control how they’re using the tool?
2020-04-15T15:54:07  <michelled> yeah, it it'll be so confusing for people
2020-04-15T16:02:52  <danayo> michelled: might be good if we could be available in some way for tech support
2020-04-15T16:04:48  <greatislander> colinclark, gtirloni -- just making a cup of tea
2020-04-15T16:04:54  <gtirloni> ok
2020-04-15T16:04:58  <colinclark> i’m getting us a zoom link
2020-04-15T16:07:35  <gmoss> danayo, michelled, colinclark: sorry just seeing this now. I can put Modernizr or another feature detection method into the tool, but I'd have to pause work on autosave to do that, of course.
2020-04-15T16:07:54  <gmoss> as far as tech support goes, I'm happy to make myself available for support on the tool
2020-04-15T16:08:13  <colinclark> why do you need modernizr, gmoss?
2020-04-15T16:08:30  <gmoss> I also had some thoughts about editing and deleting stories. I'm certain with 20 tech representatives and multiple users at each college, we'll have need for that. I can also handle that
2020-04-15T16:08:31  <colinclark> It seems to me that some basic feature detection and Infusion’s context awareness features should do exactly what you need
2020-04-15T16:08:50  <gmoss> colinclark: just as a quick way to add feature detection. but yes, ContextAware grades would do the trick too :)
2020-04-15T16:09:08  <gmoss> it's the way I'm familiar with from my previous role, no other reason
2020-04-15T16:09:20  <colinclark> yeah, also a quick way to add additional complexity
2020-04-15T16:09:27  <gmoss> true, another dependency
2020-04-15T16:09:36  <colinclark> I feel a need to say this again
2020-04-15T16:09:39  <colinclark> We’re not in a rush
2020-04-15T16:09:47  <colinclark> we’re not looking for quick fixes to anything
2020-04-15T16:10:08  <colinclark> The Storytelling Tool has suffered, I think, from the impression that we’re rushing
2020-04-15T16:10:26  <colinclark> steady and focussed is the theme of the day
2020-04-15T16:10:28  <greatislander> colinclark gtirloni Ready now, thanks for your patience

2020-04-15T18:04:24  <michelled> I'm in a meeting now, but could be available at 3 if we'd like to check in
2020-04-15T18:04:44  <gmoss> I'm also available at 3 if we'd still like to meet
2020-04-15T18:05:42  <danayo> I think a quick check-in at 3 would be good gmoss, michelled, colinclark
2020-04-15T18:05:56  <michelled> great!
2020-04-15T18:05:59  <colinclark> yes cool
2020-04-15T18:06:07  <gmoss> see you then :)
2020-04-15T18:06:29  <erictheise> michelled, when it first came up the notion of a “django primer” was that it’d be open to others in the idrc, do we still want to do that?
2020-04-15T18:07:24  <michelled> erictheise: I think the priority is greatislander and jhung. We'll mention it at one of the IDRC standup meetings and see if anyone feels like lurking
2020-04-15T18:07:25  <erictheise> I’m fine either way but I’d probably prep a little more background if it’s open beyond greatislander and jhung.
2020-04-15T18:07:31  <erictheise> k.
2020-04-15T18:07:36  <michelled> no need to prep extra :)
2020-04-15T18:08:01  <michelled> erictheise: are you available tomorrow at 4 eastern for some directory planning?
2020-04-15T18:09:36  <erictheise> yes michelled I am available at that time.

2020-04-15T18:50:17  <greatislander> erictheise 1) I am hoping to wait for jhung's PR for form elements to get merged, but then I plan to 2) I don't think there ever has been. What kind of context would you be using it in?
2020-04-15T18:58:22  <erictheise> cool on the release, greatislander, I haven’t updated for a while but will wait as my stuff’s getting very form heavy. open.svg shows in my logs and it just seemed that I would’ve noticed it before. not something I need, just puzzling over how I ever got the idea that such a thing existed.
2020-04-15T18:58:51  <greatislander> I can check and see if there's anything in history.
2020-04-15T19:00:28  <greatislander> aaah I remember what it was. The menu hamburger icon used to be `open.svg` but I renamed it to `menu.svg` as it wasn't very descriptive.
2020-04-15T19:00:44  <greatislander> erictheise ^

2020-04-15T19:04:04  <greatislander> you know erictheise I think I may be wrong about that, looks like the old version was 'hamburger.svg'… I'm stumped
2020-04-15T19:04:04  <colinclark> on my way
2020-04-15T19:34:23  <erictheise> don’t waste any more cycles on it greatisander, just wondered if it sounded familiar.

2020-04-15T19:37:27  <greatislander> jhung, cherylhjli, danayo: got the global nav ready for review: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/pull/309
2020-04-15T19:38:09  <greatislander> jhung— would like your feedback on the best way to label this nav region. I used "global navigation" but that might be ambiguous. It's kind of weird because it's not a navigation within the scope of the site.
2020-04-15T19:38:34  <greatislander> If there are any best practices for communicating this kind of nuance, I'd be interested in learning more.
2020-04-15T19:50:49  <jhung> greatislander sure I'll take a look at that.
2020-04-15T20:00:37  <gmoss> colinclark, danayo, michelled: I've added donut estimates to our list, factoring in a little padding for unexpected things

2020-04-15T20:18:22  <colinclark> gmoss: Thanks!
2020-04-15T20:19:01  <colinclark> So danayo, gmoss if I am understanding it right, the autosave feature is in the ballpark for this release
2020-04-15T20:19:41  <gmoss> colinclark: if my estimate is accurate, the PR would be opened midday Friday
2020-04-15T20:19:55  <gmoss> I should add that I haven't included review in my estimate

2020-04-15T20:23:55  <danayo> copy that gmoss, colinclark, that’s great
2020-04-15T20:25:04  <colinclark> danayo: do you think it is indeed the first priority, then?
2020-04-15T20:25:12  <colinclark> and we’ll live with the browser issues?
2020-04-15T20:41:48  <danayo> yes, I think so colinclark

2020-04-15T21:10:58  <colinclark> perfect
2020-04-15T21:11:29  <colinclark> do we need to do any additional testing with Safari in particular, gmoss, or do you think the user experience will be reasonable with it?

2020-04-15T21:16:11  <gmoss> colinclark: I think if we have time, it would be prudent, but I did some fairly extensive testing in March (the latest results on the grid)
2020-04-15T21:16:42  <gmoss> so I think it will be reasonable as-is

2020-04-15T21:38:53  <Caren_> hi Justin_o I have a Q about UIO+ when you have a moment.
2020-04-15T21:58:12  <colinclark> gmoss: Okay, sounds good
2020-04-15T22:01:18  <colinclark> gmoss: should I be testing on the aihec site itself? will we easily be able to reset the database prior to sharing it with them?
