2020-06-15T18:57:39  <cindyli> greatislander: this is my first time to do a release for the wecount website. wonder what release process did you use? i noticed there are some release commands defined in the package.json - "release major/minor/patch". do you usually use them? or do you use the github release interface: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/releases? or both?
2020-06-15T19:22:20  <greatislander> cindyli here is the process I use: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#milestones-and-releases
2020-06-15T19:23:27  <cindyli> cool. thanks, greatislander
2020-06-15T19:51:04  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo can I get your input on something?
2020-06-15T19:53:42  <cherylhjli> yep greatislander
2020-06-15T19:55:04  <greatislander> k, coop room?
2020-06-15T20:09:47  <danayo> greatislander: just seeing this sorry, are you done?
2020-06-15T20:10:03  <greatislander> Yeah but I can give you a quick update
2020-06-15T20:10:13  <danayo> ok
2020-06-15T20:58:24  <gmoss> danayo: I have a design-related question about the reorderer. Currently, we have the buttons, drag-and-drop and keyboard reordering working as we intend, but there are some quirks. first, the up/down buttons start out disabled when a block is added (via either autosave or one of the add-block buttons), and then when the user focuses on one of the blocks, all of them are updated to enable/disable the buttons
2020-06-15T20:58:24  <gmoss> according to its order in the editor. second, there's a little bit of strange behaviour with reordering occasionally not autosaving properly. I'm still trying to figure out the circumstances to reproduce this, but all of the blocks and text associated with them seem to be saving okay, just not the last reorder operation. I've seen that bug twice now. (Justin_o was witness to it as well)
2020-06-15T20:58:24  <gmoss> The question for you: do you think it would be acceptable to get it into production in this current state, or should I attempt to find a way to set those buttons to enabled/disabled on page load and when blocks are added? if we choose the latter, it's going to add some time since the solution that Justin_o and I came up with is a little complicated.
2020-06-15T21:07:44  <danayo> gmoss: I see this, just need to get back to you in a bit
2020-06-15T21:07:50  <gmoss> danayo: no worries!
2020-06-15T21:08:31  <gmoss> I have to take care of a couple of things right now anyway, i'll go do that and be back online in a couple hours. If you've answered then great, and if not I'll just get cracking on the solution :)
2020-06-15T21:08:43  <danayo> ok gmoss
2020-06-15T22:09:16  <greatislander> hi alanharnum, I moved the code over to https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-tool-library. It's now deploying here: https://coop-tool-library.vercel.app/
2020-06-15T22:30:23  <danayo> gmoss: sent you an emal about the issue, going offline shortly, let’s discuss tomorrow
