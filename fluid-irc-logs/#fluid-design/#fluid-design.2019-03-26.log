2019-03-26T15:45:58  <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo: do we have the "Inclusive Who What Where When How" documented anywhere more formally aside from the slides that Jutta shared at the crit last month?

2019-03-26T15:49:22  <danayo> jhung - I don’t think so - I think we started a google doc when we met that I was looking for
2019-03-26T15:49:45  <danayo> otherwise I don’t know of anything
2019-03-26T15:50:27  <jhung> thanks. I'll email Jutta and CC the list asking if she has written anything describing it.

2019-03-26T15:52:33  <jhung> Awesome. THere's a recording too. I'll review it and update the doc. I'd like to formalize this a bit as I'm going to start creating a lunchbox in my spare time and wonder if the 5W format might be a logical way to structure it.

2019-03-26T16:04:23  <colinclark> why not change the time of our wednesday meeting?
2019-03-26T16:04:45  <michelled> let's ask them tomorrow? I think it was difficult to find a time for the weekly meeting
2019-03-26T16:04:47  <sepidehshahi> is that ok colinclark?
2019-03-26T16:05:03  <colinclark> I don’t see why not
2019-03-26T16:06:54  <sepidehshahi> ok, I can confirm Wednesdays with Rob, and if we couldn’t change the partners meeting time, I’ll try to catch up by listening to recordings and sending out my updates ahead of time michelled and colinclark
2019-03-26T16:07:43  <colinclark> yup, that seems fine

2019-03-26T21:15:35  <danayo> cherylhjli1: are you planning to have photos for all the headers, or to mix it up with the offset highlight bars (like what you’ve got for Jobs and Blog)?
2019-03-26T21:17:23  <cherylhjli1> danayo: I'll be mixing it up! I think what I have there is what I'm thinking for which pages use photos and which pages use the text and highlight bars.
2019-03-26T21:23:49  <danayo> cherylhjli1: there’s something I find a bit jarring about landing on a page without a photo, after seeing the other pages with photos.
2019-03-26T21:24:02  <danayo> I’m not sure if its also related to the highlight bars or not. I wonder if there is a way to incorporate the line and circle instead of the highlight bar somehow? just a thought
2019-03-26T21:24:57  <cherylhjli1> danayo: hmmm interesting, so it sounds like the two are a little too different eh?
2019-03-26T21:25:02  <danayo> some way to make it look more intentional
2019-03-26T21:25:04  <danayo> yeah i think so
2019-03-26T21:25:23  <danayo> too much white space maybe after all those lovely photos :)
2019-03-26T21:25:28  <cherylhjli1> yeah danayo I can see that now
2019-03-26T21:25:28  <cherylhjli1> ahahha
