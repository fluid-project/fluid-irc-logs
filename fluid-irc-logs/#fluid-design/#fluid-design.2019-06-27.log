2019-06-27T14:25:08  <sepidehshahi> Hi michelled, do you have some time to help me fork the repo?
2019-06-27T14:25:24  <michelled> hi sepidehshahi can you wait about half an hour
2019-06-27T14:25:36  <michelled> I'm restructuring a bit so it would be better to get this done before you start up
2019-06-27T14:25:38  <sepidehshahi> for sure michelled
2019-06-27T14:26:06  <sepidehshahi> yesterday I have made some changes but I think I can easily ransfer them over
2019-06-27T14:30:36  <greatislander> cherylhjli michelled My internet link is down and we’ve had a few cloudy days so the solar power is down too. FYI I will try to connect to all our calls by phone.
2019-06-27T14:32:38  <cherylhjli> greatislander: no problem, would you like me to move our chat with ella to zoom so you can dial?
2019-06-27T14:32:45  <michelled> sepidehshahi: if you push them up to your repo then I can merge them in probably
2019-06-27T14:32:52  <greatislander> That would be awesome, thanks!
2019-06-27T14:34:27  <sepidehshahi> michelled: I just pushed the changes
2019-06-27T14:36:25  <michelled> thx sepidehshahi!

2019-06-27T15:00:23  <michelled> simonjb: I restructured the resource repo so we can use the Cupper figure shortcode. would you mind taking a glance at it? https://github.com/michelled/c2lc-open-repository/commit/86ca79c89c90e64b5be774c52bd312babd4269fb
2019-06-27T15:00:47  <michelled> it renders fine - I'm mostly wondering about naming, although I guess we could rename things later too
2019-06-27T15:04:55  <simonjb> yes michelled, I will take a look now
2019-06-27T15:05:19  <michelled> thx simonjb!
2019-06-27T15:12:03  <michelled> simonjb: I opened a pull request if that's easier https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-open-repository/pull/1
2019-06-27T15:24:36  <simonjb> it looks good michelled
2019-06-27T15:26:07  <michelled> thx!
2019-06-27T15:26:11  <simonjb> michelled: we have some inconsistency in naming of resources: "3 Step Building A Snowman" vs "3 Step Sequence - Brushing Teeth" vs "4-step-sequence-carving-a-jack-o-lantern"
2019-06-27T15:26:29  <michelled> sepidehshahi: do you have an opinion on that naming?
2019-06-27T15:28:03  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: and michelled I have also noticed that one and it’s in my list of fixes to do. I wasn’t able to see my changes on the site befoew, thus there some issues that I am planning to fix today
2019-06-27T15:28:39  <sepidehshahi> so the name would be 4 Step Sequence - Carving a Jack O Lantern
2019-06-27T15:29:43  <sepidehshahi> michelled: do you think if I can fork it now, so I can start making those edits
2019-06-27T15:29:47  <simonjb> is the idea with the duplication between the 4 robots (they all have the same sequence pages) to have a complete set for each robot so a teacher wouldn't have to refer elsewhere (if we had a common 'sequencing activities' section or such)?
2019-06-27T15:31:21  <michelled> sepidehshahi: yes, you can fork now and start making changes
2019-06-27T15:31:31  <michelled> I'm just in a meeting right now so can help you when it ends
2019-06-27T15:32:31  <sepidehshahi> simonjb: Bridges team has tagged some of the files as generic and they want those files to be available for all applications. They mentioned that a teacher who has Sphero may never look into the Cubetto folder and asked me to make sure they are included for each application
2019-06-27T15:32:56  <simonjb> ok, thanks sepidehshahi
2019-06-27T15:33:51  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@192-0-158-138.cpe.teksavvy.com> has joined #fluid-design
2019-06-27T15:36:31  <michelled> sepidehshahi: I'm sorry, I'm multi tasking so maybe not following but we really shouldn't have mulitple copies of a resource in the repo
2019-06-27T15:36:48  <michelled> it's very easy for them to get out of sync and it increases the maintenance burden
2019-06-27T15:37:59  <sepidehshahi> I agree, but Bridges concern is also reasonable. Another way we can address this is to create a generic folder and add those common files to that folder. But then there is a risk for teachers to never check out those resources
2019-06-27T15:38:45  <simonjb> we could link from the robot-specific pages to the generic resources
2019-06-27T15:38:50  <simonjb> sepidehshahi, michelled ^
2019-06-27T15:38:55  <sepidehshahi> Is there any way that we can automate this? so we tag specific files as generic and once we update them they are reflected for different applications
2019-06-27T15:38:57  <michelled> yeah, that sounds good
2019-06-27T15:39:47  <michelled> sepidehshahi: the way to automate would be to have only 1 copy of it in the repository and then we can link to it in each of the robots
2019-06-27T15:40:07  <sepidehshahi> that sounds good michelled
2019-06-27T15:42:18  <sepidehshahi> michelled: and simonjb I don’t know how to do the linking so I may need your help for that
2019-06-27T15:42:39  <simonjb> sepidehshahi, michelled: could we meet to brainstorm potential approaches?
2019-06-27T15:44:19  <michelled> yep! I can ping you two when I'm done meetings
2019-06-27T15:45:52  <sepidehshahi> for sure simonjb
2019-06-27T15:55:34  <cherylhjli> greatislander michelled danayo_ - quick stand up?
2019-06-27T15:56:13  <michelled> cherylhjli: yes, our meeting just ended
2019-06-27T15:56:31  <sepidehshahi> michelled: where should I fork it from, your repo, mine or simonjb?
2019-06-27T15:56:40  <greatislander> My internet is back!

2019-06-27T15:57:05  <michelled> sepidehshahi: from the central one here: https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-open-repository
2019-06-27T15:57:35  <michelled> sepidehshahi: avtar is working on getting that repository served up at resources.codelearncreate.org
2019-06-27T15:58:31  <avtar> michelled: it's online https://resources.codelearncreate.org/
2019-06-27T15:58:47  <danayo_> we’re all in your room cherylhjli :)
2019-06-27T15:59:00  <avtar> and gets redeployed when changes are pushed to the master branch here https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-open-repository
2019-06-27T15:59:07  <michelled> oh wow!

2019-06-27T16:02:13  <simonjb> avtar: looks like we have a font rendering issue for the titles
2019-06-27T16:03:23  <simonjb> titles should be "Miriam Libre"
2019-06-27T16:03:30  <simonjb> not sure what's going wrong
2019-06-27T16:06:19  <avtar> maybe due to there being two static directories?

2019-06-27T16:11:45  <michelled> sepidehshahi: I can just help you - let's screen share after I'm done this call
2019-06-27T16:11:55  <michelled> I think it will be more confusing to add more people :)
2019-06-27T16:12:35  <gmoss> michelled: I'm just coming into it now, I thought her first repo was a fork so I suggested she delete the new fork she'd just made, not realizing the first one wasn't *really* a fork, just a copy
2019-06-27T16:13:06  <gmoss> But okay I'll leave it alone haha
2019-06-27T16:13:54  <michelled> gmoss: I've done some changing underneath - her's was a fork of simon's repo I think but he probably deleted that repo and reforked by now
2019-06-27T16:14:31  <sepidehshahi> michelled: I just wait for you then to help me fork the right thing
2019-06-27T16:14:45  <sepidehshahi> please let me know when you have time

2019-06-27T16:15:23  <gmoss> michelled: if it helps, I suggested maybe renaming Sepi's current repo, then re-forking the C2LC repo and it'll have the 'correct' name
2019-06-27T16:15:42  <sepidehshahi> avtar and simonjb some of the icons and the logo are also not rendering

2019-06-27T16:20:03  <simonjb> avtar: having 2 static directories is fine -- hugo will override the theme files with the repo-specific files
2019-06-27T16:20:17  <simonjb> if you run hugo server locally, it renders fine
2019-06-27T16:22:24  <simonjb> I'm just eating lunch now, but I can investigate in a bit
2019-06-27T16:24:30  <michelled> simonjb, sepidehshahi: when would you like to meet?
2019-06-27T16:24:30  <avtar> michelled, sepidehshahi, simonjb: looking at the url for the logo on the home page and it looks good https://resources.codelearncreate.org/images/logo.svg
2019-06-27T16:24:53  <sepidehshahi> I’m available michelled
2019-06-27T16:24:54  <avtar> but the url changes on the other pages https://resources.codelearncreate.org/accessible-coding-basics/
2019-06-27T16:25:02  <avtar> on that page the url seems to be https://resources.codelearncreate.org/accessible-coding-basics/images/logo.svg

2019-06-27T16:26:22  <gmoss> tidier
2019-06-27T16:26:59  <simonjb> yes avtar, it looks like it's rendering a relative url: "images/logo.svg"
2019-06-27T16:27:12  <simonjb> but on hugo server, it's not, interesting
2019-06-27T16:28:14  <simonjb> michelled, sepidehshahi: I can meet now, if you don't mind me eating while we talk
2019-06-27T16:28:29  <sepidehshahi> not at all simonjb :)

2019-06-27T16:29:00  <simonjb> avtar: we'll need to look at the theme, maybe it's relying on us setting the deployment root?

2019-06-27T16:41:37  <avtar> simonjb: looks like the theme includes a netlfy.toml config https://github.com/avtar/c2lc-open-repository/blob/master/themes/cupper-hugo-theme/netlify.toml#L3

2019-06-27T16:51:12  <avtar> sweet!
2019-06-27T16:52:00  <simonjb> the cupper theme is using Hugo's absURL function: https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-open-repository/blob/master/themes/cupper-hugo-theme/layouts/partials/header.html#L5
2019-06-27T16:52:34  <simonjb> this relies on setting the baseURL config option (which we aren't doing) https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/
2019-06-27T16:53:10  <simonjb> so, we could fix by setting this in our config.toml
2019-06-27T16:53:58  <simonjb> or, it looks like we might be able to also set in the netlify.toml: https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-open-repository/blob/master/themes/cupper-hugo-theme/netlify.toml#L8

2019-06-27T16:55:17  <simonjb> I like the option of specifying it external to our repo (the netlify.toml option if it works)
2019-06-27T16:55:43  <simonjb> we could also update the theme to use relative URLs, but I'd rather not
2019-06-27T16:55:59  <simonjb> I'd rather make minimal changes to the theme
2019-06-27T16:56:06  <avtar> makes sense

2019-06-27T17:18:11  <simonjb> avtar: ah, hold on
2019-06-27T17:18:38  <avtar> sorry, this window was minimized
2019-06-27T17:18:52  <simonjb> I ran hugo locally with just the baseURL addition and I'm seeing the CSS being rendered as expected
2019-06-27T17:19:29  <simonjb> I wonder if the double "css" is an arifact from before
2019-06-27T17:19:42  <simonjb> let's just merge in the baseURL change and see what happens
2019-06-27T17:20:11  <simonjb> I'm optimistic that's all we need
2019-06-27T17:21:03  <simonjb> avtar: if you remove the template-styles.css change and just leave the config.toml, I'll merge it now

2019-06-27T17:22:19  <simonjb> avtar: sure, I can merge locally and squash

2019-06-27T19:26:11  <michelled> sepidehshahi: I merged your changes - should there be any resources for code-and-go or sphero? https://resources.codelearncreate.org/lesson-plans-and-materials/
2019-06-27T19:27:49  <sepidehshahi> As of now, we don’t have anything specific for Sphero and Code and Go but the general resources should be rendered in those folders. So, they will have some content
