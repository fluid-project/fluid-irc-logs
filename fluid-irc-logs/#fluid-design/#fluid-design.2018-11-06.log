2018-11-06T15:55:15  <Justin_o> not the best example but this is sort of why the dark background reminded me of a carpet https://goo.gl/images/5JSvVi
2018-11-06T15:55:55  <Justin_o> it's almost like the confetti is in the air on the white and on the floor in the dark..

2018-11-06T16:10:54  <Caren_> Justin_o: avtar I was also reminded of the Mephis design movement from the 80s and the popular patterns that evolved at the time…the carpet design is likely influenced by that movement.

2018-11-06T16:21:56  <danayo> it made me think it would be such a cool way to create a personal privacy policy

2018-11-06T20:52:50  <danayo> sepidehshahi: did you do any kind of “journey mapping” aCT
2018-11-06T20:54:36  <sepidehshahi> danayo: we tried a kind of journey mapping in one of our co-design sessions
2018-11-06T20:55:29  <sepidehshahi> danayo: here is the structure we used. If you scroll down you will see our journey map: https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/ideas/co-design-session-1/
2018-11-06T20:56:51  <sepidehshahi> for our participants using journey maps was a bit confusing as they were trying to imagine a journey and map it out. But in your case if they are mapping an actual day of their life, it should be easier to use journey maps
2018-11-06T20:56:55  <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2018-11-06T20:57:19  <sepidehshahi> Lisa has also used journey mapping in a couple of Big Idea workshops danayo
2018-11-06T21:01:16  <danayo> sepidehshahi: Actually my cat hit enter in IRC before I finished typing that!!
2018-11-06T21:01:17  <danayo> thank you
2018-11-06T21:01:55  <danayo> yes, we want to map a kind of “day in the life"
2018-11-06T21:02:00  <danayo> and wondered if you’d done something similar
2018-11-06T21:02:16  <danayo> sepidehshahi: I will look at your maps
2018-11-06T21:03:58  <sepidehshahi> danayo: I have done journey mapping in the past
2018-11-06T21:04:09  <sepidehshahi> how can I help you?
2018-11-06T21:07:18  <danayo> you have sepidehshahi :)
