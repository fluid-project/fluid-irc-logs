2020-02-19T20:49:11  <colinclark> greatislander: I didn’t want to impose more discussion so late in the conversation, but your example is really fascinating
2020-02-19T20:49:18  <jhung> greatislander sure. Give me 5 minutes?
2020-02-19T20:49:27  <colinclark> I was thinking how one of the “tools for accessibility” in my mind is CSS itself
2020-02-19T20:49:35  <greatislander> Yeah! Absolutely
2020-02-19T20:49:42  <colinclark> It is just so amazing that we have this kind of a system
2020-02-19T20:49:47  <greatislander> There's a bunch of other CSS things like that one I've seen
2020-02-19T20:49:55  <colinclark> in which a system can be modified live
2020-02-19T20:50:16  <colinclark> Comparing and contrasting the tool that cherylhjli showed with the alt text tool is really enlightening, from a systems design perspective
2020-02-19T20:50:33  <colinclark> one is a separate application that can only have an effect from a distance
2020-02-19T20:50:50  <colinclark> the other is a way of specifying customizations within a live system
2020-02-19T20:50:54  <colinclark> serendipitious change
2020-02-19T20:51:07  <greatislander> One of the many reasons I love CSS :)
2020-02-19T20:51:27  <colinclark> when the web was made, everyone thought it was broken
2020-02-19T20:51:32  <colinclark> but this is such a brilliant architecture
2020-02-19T20:51:56  <greatislander> Also colinclark are you familiar with the general sibling combinator?
2020-02-19T20:52:16  <colinclark> I don’t know that I am
2020-02-19T20:52:24  <greatislander> ```css
2020-02-19T20:52:24  <greatislander> h2 ~ h1 {
2020-02-19T20:52:24  <greatislander>   color: red;
2020-02-19T20:52:24  <greatislander> }
2020-02-19T20:52:24  <greatislander> ```
2020-02-19T20:52:28  <greatislander> ```
2020-02-19T20:52:28  <greatislander> h2 ~ h1 {
2020-02-19T20:52:28  <greatislander>   color: red;
2020-02-19T20:52:28  <greatislander> }
2020-02-19T20:52:28  <greatislander> ```
2020-02-19T20:52:31  <greatislander> oops
2020-02-19T20:52:46  <greatislander> So what that does is if an h1 follows an h2 in the flow order, you can highlight it
2020-02-19T20:53:08  <greatislander> There's lots of use cases but I like that one— if someone is breaking the heading order, the CSS itself can call it out
2020-02-19T20:53:14  <greatislander> Magic tilde!
2020-02-19T20:53:34  <greatislander> jhung I'll be in the co-op room
2020-02-19T20:53:35  <danayo> that’s so great, greatislander
2020-02-19T20:54:10  <greatislander> yeah, it's super cool :)
2020-02-19T20:54:32  <danayo> colinclark, greatislander: ok if I add your chat here into today’s notes? I think it would be good to capture this discussion - it’s super interesting
2020-02-19T20:54:37  <greatislander> Yes!
