2020-01-13T17:57:40  <erictheise> Hi everyone, I'm on a flaky connection as I change planes. On Friday, Ned, Jon, and I met and talked about my mapping toolkits and some possible architectures that would allow coops to keep their index info current in passive and more active ways.
2020-01-13T17:58:18  <jhung> Thanks erictheise. Have a safe flight!
2020-01-13T17:58:29  <erictheise> Sorry I'll miss the sketch meeting later but Jon said he'd try and record it so I'll catch up tonight and will be on a regular standup schedule for the rest of the week.
