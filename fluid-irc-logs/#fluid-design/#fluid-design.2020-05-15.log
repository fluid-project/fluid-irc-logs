2020-05-15T16:17:51  <cindyli> greatislander: search.svg is used as a background image for the search box on the we count site. as it's not an inline svg, its colour cannot be adjusted when a high theme kicks in. here are my 2 solutions: 1. change colour by swapping search icons in different colours, which means we need to keep a number of search svgs in different colors; 2. move away from using it as a background image and change it to an inline svg. I started
2020-05-15T16:17:51  <cindyli> with this method but ran into some issues with getting the inline looked correct on the mobile layout. but i can give another try on this.
2020-05-15T16:18:11  <cindyli> wonder which way would you recommend or do you have a 3rd solution?
2020-05-15T16:18:14  <greatislander> I think inline is best if it's doable!
2020-05-15T16:18:39  <cindyli> ok. will try inline
2020-05-15T16:19:00  <greatislander> The other option is using the SVG as a mask-image and changing the background colour (see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image)
2020-05-15T16:19:07  <greatislander> but that's not supported in some older browsers
2020-05-15T16:20:02  <cindyli> great. i will try inline first and have this as a backup. thanks, greatislander
2020-05-15T16:31:58  <gmoss> cindyli: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-05-15T16:35:19  <cindyli> ya, gmoss
2020-05-15T16:36:01  <gmoss> cindyli: okay, I'm in the standup room
2020-05-15T16:36:07  <cindyli> ok

2020-05-15T19:38:00  <erictheise> off-topic, but if youâ€™re bored with narratives an abstract cameraless 16mm film I made long ago will be in a zoom screening of handmade films tonight from 7-9p eastern.
