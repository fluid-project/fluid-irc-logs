2019-02-04T14:39:18  <jhung> hi cherylhjli. I got your email about the design crit. Next week's crit is open. Maybe confirm that's a good day for danayo when she's online?
2019-02-04T14:39:53  <cherylhjli> jhung - great to know, sounds good! will confirm with you later today.
2019-02-04T14:40:19  <jhung> ok. I've changed it tentatively for Feb 12 cherylhjli
2019-02-04T14:40:32  <cherylhjli> thank you jhung!

2019-02-04T15:47:04  <michelled> gmoss: how are things?
2019-02-04T15:49:42  <gmoss> michelled: good! I'm awfully tired from my weekend so I've only just got my day started. Do we have a cutoff for development today?
2019-02-04T15:50:38  <michelled> yes, but also we are planning to do some testing on production once simonjb merges the 205 pull request
2019-02-04T15:50:47  <michelled> will you be able to help with testing?
2019-02-04T15:54:17  <michelled> gmoss: ^
2019-02-04T15:55:02  <gmoss> michelled: for sure. My plan was to come into the IDRC after standup so I can run through the testing grid
2019-02-04T15:57:15  <michelled> gmoss: if you're able to come in sooner I think that would be better given that alan is leaving at 4:00 today - maybe don't worry about going to standup
2019-02-04T16:03:31  <gmoss> michelled: okay, I'll be there ASAP!
2019-02-04T16:03:56  <michelled> thx gmoss!
2019-02-04T16:20:10  <michelled> hey cindyli
2019-02-04T16:21:57  <cindyli> hi michelled
2019-02-04T16:22:28  <michelled> no rush on this, but when you get a chance can you take over code review for these two repos? https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/pulls https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pulls
2019-02-04T16:23:14  <michelled> cindyli: SJRK-205 will be merged soon, but I think the others need some review
2019-02-04T16:23:23  <cindyli> sure
2019-02-04T16:23:26  <michelled> thx!
2019-02-04T16:23:29  <cindyli> np
2019-02-04T16:29:27  <simonjb> cindyli: I will also merge Alan's PR https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/pull/11
2019-02-04T16:30:04  <simonjb> I will merge that one together with SJRK-205
2019-02-04T16:30:23  <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2019-02-04T16:30:25  <simonjb> and some fixes I made to SJRK-205
2019-02-04T16:30:35  <simonjb> https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/compare/learning-to-learn...simonbates:SJRK-205
2019-02-04T16:30:38  <michelled> cindyli: one more thing - today it's fine to merge things, but we are going to freeze at end of day today - so no more merging for a few days
2019-02-04T16:30:38  <simonjb> cindyli: ^
2019-02-04T16:30:57  <cindyli> ok. thanks for letting me know
