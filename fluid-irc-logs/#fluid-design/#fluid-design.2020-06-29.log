2020-06-29T16:30:53  <cherylhjli> danayo - I think I have enough in the other screens to give it a first pass, and then we can check in about it?
2020-06-29T16:31:27  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o: are you available for ST check-in?

2020-06-29T17:07:44  <cherylhjli> yep
2020-06-29T17:07:52  <cherylhjli> greatislander ^
2020-06-29T17:08:41  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm ready to pair up, now
2020-06-29T17:08:55  <cindyli> gmoss: see you in the standup room
2020-06-29T18:53:20  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo ready to chat!
2020-06-29T18:53:51  <cherylhjli> greatislander - it looks like dana is offline now, we can chat though
2020-06-29T18:54:30  <greatislander> okay!
2020-06-29T19:01:08  <cherylhjli> greatislander - i saved the directory XD file, it should update in a bit
2020-06-29T19:01:30  <greatislander> it has updated!
2020-06-29T19:01:33  <greatislander> thanks Cheryl
2020-06-29T19:38:21  <michelled1> jhung, Justin_o: could one of you create a new wiki space for the NRC project?
2020-06-29T19:38:35  <michelled1> it would be good to get them a link to the wiki with a little structure in it soonish
2020-06-29T19:44:31  <Justin_o> michelled1: I can setup the space, but we should probably decide how we want to the landing page of that space to look and etc.
2020-06-29T19:44:43  <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2020-06-29T19:45:24  <jhung> michelled1 sure. I'll talk this over with Justin_o. Do we need to pre-populate that space with some project related info (i.e. grant info etc.)?
2020-06-29T19:45:45  <michelled1> I think we should pre-populate a bit so they have a sense
2020-06-29T19:46:09  <michelled1> probably not the whole grant - but maybe the descriptions?
2020-06-29T19:46:19  <michelled1> I wonder if Lisa would have some ideas of what would be good
2020-06-29T19:47:12  <jhung> ok michelled1. What Justin_o and I can do is set up a space, and ask Lisa and Vera to populate some relevant bits before we share it.
2020-06-29T19:48:08  <Justin_o> michelled1: is there a name for this project?
2020-06-29T19:48:44  <michelled1> Intelligent User Interfaces and Guidelines for Vulnerable Populations
2020-06-29T19:49:23  <michelled1> sounds good jhung!
2020-06-29T19:49:36  <Justin_o> michelled1: thanks, is the what we want to call the space, or is there something more appropriate for that
2020-06-29T19:49:53  <michelled1> good question :)
2020-06-29T19:50:15  <michelled1> I'm not sure
2020-06-29T19:50:25  <michelled1> do you have an opinion?
2020-06-29T19:51:00  <Justin_o> Not really.. the name seems long to use as the space name, but I'm not sure it actually matters.
2020-06-29T20:00:11  * gtirloni errand, be back in 1 hour or so
2020-06-29T20:26:47  <greatislander> colinclark, cherylhjli I think we can use the co-op room when ready to meet.
2020-06-29T20:32:09  <colinclark> one sec greatislander!
2020-06-29T21:13:29  <greatislander> meant to tell you— I got an email back from Jill at Sassafras and she said that they don't have capacity to take on hosting/maintenance for PCC for the forseeable future.
2020-06-29T21:13:43  <greatislander> She asked if we'd been in touch with Colab :)
2020-06-29T21:14:24  <greatislander> colinclark ^
2020-06-29T21:14:43  <colinclark> ah interesting
2020-06-29T21:15:02  <colinclark> Well, I wonder if we should have a Zoom call with McKenzie and one of their technical people
2020-06-29T21:15:23  <colinclark> talk them through what we’ve got and ideally what we’d like
2020-06-29T21:15:23  <greatislander> yeah, might be a good idea. perhaps you and gtirloni and I can propose that for early next week
2020-06-29T21:15:37  <colinclark> ultimately it’s Trebor’s decision—we can just make a recommendation
2020-06-29T21:15:46  <colinclark> I’l respond to McKenzie’s email
2020-06-29T21:17:50  <greatislander> okay great!
2020-06-29T22:43:52  <erictheise> greatislander I may not be able to review #119 & #123 until after you knock off for the day but will get to them tonight.
2020-06-29T22:44:02  <greatislander> thanks erictheise!
2020-06-29T22:44:30  <erictheise> are there mocks of where maps go on the profile pages or has that feature been dropped greatislander?
2020-06-29T22:45:44  <greatislander> Dropped for the time being, but we can plan for them appearing on the contact tab, e.g: https://demo.directory.platform.coop/organizations/1307
2020-06-29T22:46:03  <greatislander> (co-op picked from the map at random)
2020-06-29T22:47:11  <greatislander> I'm signing off to go on a grocery run, will check back later.
