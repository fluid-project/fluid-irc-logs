2020-06-16T14:42:57  <greatislander> cherylhjli: I'm not seeing the new icons. In NextCloud it looks like that Illustrator file hasn't been updated recently. Is yours syncing properly?
2020-06-16T14:45:29  <cherylhjli> ughh no! give me a min
2020-06-16T14:45:49  <cherylhjli> greatislander - i'll send you the illustrator file manually in the meantime
2020-06-16T14:51:55  <greatislander> thanks cherylhjli
2020-06-16T15:31:12  <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC plannign will start soon
2020-06-16T15:57:06  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo jhung quick review needed if you have capacity: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/pull/393
2020-06-16T16:19:50  <gtirloni> gmoss: FYI https://github.com/sachin10101998/fluidproject.org/pull/1
2020-06-16T16:22:01  <gmoss> gtirloni: oh nice, thanks for opening that! I was going to let Sachin know about that work after your 6288 PR was merged in (which I see it is now)
2020-06-16T16:25:40  <gtirloni> np
2020-06-16T16:27:28  <erictheise> greatislander, all the Category Groups are “Cooperatives”?
2020-06-16T16:28:40  <greatislander> Sorry, can you clarify?
2020-06-16T16:29:28  <erictheise> thought you were going to populate the demo database with the new Category Groups but I expected some variance across categories.
2020-06-16T16:30:07  <erictheise> like “Organization exploring transition to a co-op” should be “potential-cooperatives”?
2020-06-16T16:30:43  <greatislander> It should. I didn't go in and make those changes from the shell because I'm not that comfortable with the shell and don't want to push my luck with production data, and I don't have admin privileges in the demo database to do this yet.
2020-06-16T16:31:43  <erictheise> you should have CRUD on everything at this point, my mistake. I remember offering but not the outcome.
2020-06-16T16:32:56  <erictheise> you are a superuser now.
2020-06-16T16:32:59  <greatislander> Thanks!
2020-06-16T16:33:04  <greatislander> Will make those adjustments.
2020-06-16T16:33:16  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: are you available for ST check-in? maybe 12:40 so we have a short break
2020-06-16T16:33:17  <gmoss> ?
2020-06-16T16:33:31  <erictheise> should’ve done that after the move from AWS, really sorry.
2020-06-16T16:33:36  <greatislander> no worries!
2020-06-16T16:34:08  <greatislander> I just closed this: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/issues/90
2020-06-16T16:34:49  <greatislander> I think we still need the type. I'm going to open a new ticket to clarify, will solicit your feedback as well as danayo and cherylhjli's feedback.
2020-06-16T16:34:53  <danayo> sure gmoss 12:40 works
2020-06-16T16:35:00  <cindyli> sure, gmoss
2020-06-16T16:36:10  <michelled> works for me
2020-06-16T16:40:53  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo quick chat?
2020-06-16T16:41:20  <greatislander> oh, never mind, I see you are in a call right now danayo

2020-06-16T17:06:32  <greatislander> current mood (cc cherylhjli danayo erictheise): https://twitter.com/williampietri/status/1249026903802966016
2020-06-16T17:06:46  <cherylhjli> too true!
2020-06-16T17:07:03  <cherylhjli> greatislander - sorry if I missed this, did you and danayo meet already?
2020-06-16T17:07:11  <jhung> ROFL. This is why people in my household never load the dishwasher.
2020-06-16T17:37:22  <gmoss> danayo: the CSS bug is no more :)
2020-06-16T17:37:28  <danayo> greatislander, cherylhjli just finished storytelling meeting and need to eat something, can we meet at 2?
2020-06-16T17:37:33  <danayo> gmoss: awesome!
2020-06-16T17:37:48  <greatislander> hey danayo, just chatted with cherylhjli, let's talk at 2
2020-06-16T17:37:52  <danayo> ok
2020-06-16T17:54:31  <danayo> gmoss, michelled, Justin_o, cindyli: added notes from our meeting today to this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUvW6PnQAcOntArrrUUyHp2Lxs3dENnAZxMbR9cZgsQ/edit?usp=sharing
2020-06-16T17:54:48  <danayo> please let me know / edit or comment if I missed anything
2020-06-16T17:55:09  <danayo> colinclark ^
2020-06-16T17:55:24  <danayo> colinclark: storytelling notes
2020-06-16T17:56:06  <michelled> thx danayo
2020-06-16T17:57:48  <gmoss> danayo: I've had a thought - what if we just always hide the disabled reorder buttons?
2020-06-16T17:57:52  <gmoss> not only in contrast themes
2020-06-16T18:00:49  <gmoss> danayo: btw I'm heading offline for an hour or so, hopefully back at 3 :)
2020-06-16T18:01:21  <danayo> ok gmoss
2020-06-16T18:01:26  <danayo> greatislander: ready in 2!
2020-06-16T18:03:08  <greatislander> danayo I'm in the  co-op room
2020-06-16T18:32:41  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo erictheise for your consideration: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/issues/94
2020-06-16T18:32:46  <greatislander> Taking my lunch break.
2020-06-16T20:01:39  <danayo> gmoss: I’m editing the help doc content in a Google doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z4IrV_oJdKwdL_LxwPe99EADHx09fROz_uBK-3fvCMc/edit?usp=sharing
2020-06-16T20:02:26  <gmoss> danayo: awesome :) if you want me to review or anything just let me know!
2020-06-16T20:02:45  <danayo> please do gmoss
2020-06-16T20:02:50  <danayo> and cindyli, Justin_o, michelled ^ as well
2020-06-16T20:09:29  <danayo> gmoss: especially the sections I’ve tagged you in comments on
2020-06-16T20:10:32  <gmoss> danayo: sure thing! I'll take a look shortly :) just wrangling some CSS while a cat is sitting on my hand haha
2020-06-16T20:29:51  <greatislander> Hi erictheise, I initially requested your review on this but I'm just going to go ahead and merge it; it is a pretty minor, hopefully non-controversial change to the data model for Roles which blocks the larger task  I'm working on at the moment. https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/95
2020-06-16T20:32:11  <danayo> gmoss: re: your previous comment to remove the inactive-state buttons even in regular contrast mode, I would prefer to keep them visible (but greyed-out)
2020-06-16T20:33:18  <gmoss> danayo: okay, thanks. that's easier anyway
2020-06-16T20:33:20  <danayo> I was looking at UIO behaviour, it’s interesting, in that case the button remains but the control label is removed in the inactive state
2020-06-16T20:33:51  <danayo> I actually think the control label should be visible (but greyed out) - it’s kind of an in-between state
2020-06-16T20:33:52  <danayo> anyway
2020-06-16T20:34:08  <danayo> something to mention perhaps to you Justin_o ^
2020-06-16T20:34:32  <danayo> oops looks like Justin_o  is away
2020-06-16T20:42:39  <gmoss> he'll see it when he connects again :)
2020-06-16T20:43:20  <gmoss> that's pretty interesting. I also just tested out the reordering using NVDA, and it doesn't play super well with the built-in keyboard controls of the reorderer component. It's a good thing we added the buttons!
2020-06-16T20:43:31  <gmoss> danayo ^
2020-06-16T20:44:26  <danayo> good catch gmoss
2020-06-16T20:45:32  <danayo> I put a comment in the doc about using the up/down arrow keys to control the block up/down buttons, but I wonder if that might cause some NVDA or other screenreader KB shortcut conflict as well gmoos
2020-06-16T20:45:36  <danayo> gmoss!
2020-06-16T20:48:35  <gmoss> danayo: yeah it seems to, unfortunately.
2020-06-16T20:49:36  <danayo> good to know gmoss
2020-06-16T20:50:31  <gmoss> I think the controls are still valuable to share, but we could mention that it may conflict with screen reader software. Going to review the doc now :)_
2020-06-16T20:51:44  <danayo> gmoss for the re-order buttons, I think that means it would be better if the buttons were individually focusable, and use Enter to select - I think that’s what you have implemented now is that right?
2020-06-16T20:54:56  <gmoss> danayo: I think I may have misunderstood what you meant by "a comment in the doc about using the up/down arrow keys...". I didn't notice that you wrote the word "buttons" in there. Currently, the up/down buttons are individually focusable and can be used with Enter or Space (using Enter makes Edge 44 do odd things to the focus order, not sure if that persists in Chromium Edge)
2020-06-16T20:56:15  <gmoss> NVDA keyboard shortcuts and the reorderer keyboard shortcuts (up/down or i/m to select whole blocks) do seem to conflict, with the NVDA shortcuts working and the reorderer ones not
2020-06-16T20:57:50  <gmoss> it'll be interesting to see how the drag-and-drop works on mobile devices
2020-06-16T20:57:56  <gmoss> how/if
2020-06-16T20:58:22  <danayo> yes I tried the demo on my phone gmoss but it didn’t work
2020-06-16T21:00:38  <gmoss> danayo: hmm, what were you experiencing? drag-and-drop in the layoutReorderer demo works alright for me on my phone: https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/reorderer/layoutReorderer/
2020-06-16T21:01:33  <danayo>  ah actually it does work gmoss
2020-06-16T21:01:37  <gmoss> oh wonderful!
2020-06-16T21:01:42  <danayo> I think I was grabbing the wrong spot on the block
2020-06-16T21:02:25  <gmoss> danayo: were you trying this with the layout demo or with the tool, somehow? would it be helpful for me to host the site with ngrok again, so you can try it out "for real"?
2020-06-16T21:11:24  <danayo> I was trying the layout demo on my phone gmoss
2020-06-16T21:11:47  <danayo> testing a live version always helps gmoss
2020-06-16T21:12:02  <gmoss> danayo: okay, I'll spin up the server and send you a link
2020-06-16T21:12:17  <danayo> thanks gmoss, need to walk the dog now, back later
2020-06-16T21:12:31  <gmoss> danayo: okay, let me know when you're ready to test and i'll do that :)
2020-06-16T21:13:10  <danayo> ok
2020-06-16T21:48:42  <greatislander> erictheise quick call to clarify this?
2020-06-16T21:54:13  <erictheise> sure; where?
2020-06-16T21:54:25  <greatislander> co-op Zoom room
