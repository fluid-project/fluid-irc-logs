2019-05-31T18:32:09  <carenwatkins_> Hi danayo_ michelled colinclark gmoss I've updated the storytelling doc to include some pics and reflections from the workshop this morning. I took pics of all the creatures the kids created...they absolutely LOVED the activity! Calum facilitated and the class also enjoyed that...
2019-05-31T18:32:42  <gmoss> carenwatkins_: that's great! looking forward to looking at them :)
2019-05-31T18:33:32  <carenwatkins_> gmoss I'm going back on Wednesday because there wasn't enough time to finish up. Can the tool stay open if we monitor the activity?
2019-05-31T18:34:18  <gmoss> carenwatkins_: I think as long as someone is willing to commit to daily moderation/monitoring, that should be okay. Do you know the method for deleting stories?
2019-05-31T18:34:45  <carenwatkins_> gmoss: I don't, can you walk me through that?
2019-05-31T18:35:13  <gmoss> michelled: do you have any thoughts on this? carenwatkins_ I can send you instructions and walk you through it, for sure. we can use the test story as an example :)
2019-05-31T18:35:33  <carenwatkins_> Sounds great, gmoss
2019-05-31T18:38:06  <gmoss> carenwatkins_: to confirm, does this mean that you are volunteering to keep an eye on the stories until we've locked it down again?
2019-05-31T18:38:40  <carenwatkins_> yes, gmoss
2019-05-31T18:38:47  <colinclark> carenwatkins_: it sounds like it was an amazing event!
2019-05-31T18:40:26  <gmoss> carenwatkins_: let me know when you're ready to walk through deleting a story
2019-05-31T18:45:20  <carenwatkins_> gmoss: I can open my room now. Are you available?
2019-05-31T18:46:09  <gmoss> carenwatkins_: I can join you there in 5 mins :)
2019-05-31T19:03:51  <carenwatkins_> It was lovely, colinclark ... and we get to go back on Wed to publish and critique :-)

2019-05-31T19:42:52  <gmoss> hopefully it all goes smoothly :)
