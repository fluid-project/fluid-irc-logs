2020-04-07T15:28:13  <cindyli> greatislander: the IDRC logo is still on the wecount home page - https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/, which causes the overflow on mobile devices. we talked about this at yesterday's meeting. I'm thinking to remove it from the post. would there be a problem if i remove it?
2020-04-07T15:28:38  <greatislander> No but I have to do a bunch of WordPress content work so I can do that at the same time
2020-04-07T15:28:44  <greatislander> If you want to do it now, go ahead though!
