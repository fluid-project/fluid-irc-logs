2020-04-14T13:11:28  <michelled> danielcho, colinclark: given that simonjb is away today, I think we should push C2LC iteration planning until tomorrow
2020-04-14T13:11:39  <colinclark> ok, that sounds fine to me

2020-04-14T13:11:57  <colinclark> which is cool
2020-04-14T13:12:05  <michelled> oh great!
2020-04-14T13:12:16  <michelled> do you think we should still do our design jam?
2020-04-14T13:12:21  <michelled> today, I mean
2020-04-14T13:12:32  <danielcho> I can share that during the design meeting today, or I can just share it on skype
2020-04-14T13:12:52  <danielcho> I made a google doc for that

2020-04-14T15:32:21  <colinclark> lemme check
2020-04-14T15:32:42  <colinclark> 12-1 EDT works for me, greatislander

2020-04-14T15:40:08  <Justin_o> greatislander: you just reminded me, during our planning, about the tabs vs spaces point you brought up. I wonder if you'd be willing to share that with the fluid-work mailing list. I think it's an interesting point for us to discuss or at least to be aware of for other projects.

2020-04-14T15:47:29  <Teddy___> not in github yet
2020-04-14T15:47:45  <Teddy___> I can make a PR for it
2020-04-14T15:48:28  <greatislander> I wouldn't do that yet— can you push your branch, then share a link via email with me, Cindy, and Justin?
2020-04-14T15:50:11  <Teddy___> okay
2020-04-14T16:01:47  <gmoss> danayo, colinclark, michelled: should we meet today to talk about Storytelling Tool things, rather than tomorrow?
2020-04-14T16:02:00  <colinclark> i think that would be wise, yes
2020-04-14T16:05:32  <danayo> colinclark, michelled, gmoss meet now?
2020-04-14T16:05:38  <gmoss> I'm good now

2020-04-14T16:06:05  <danayo> ok
2020-04-14T16:07:57  <colinclark> cindyli: Since simonjb is away today, do you have time to review and merge the Kettle pull request?
2020-04-14T16:08:47  <cindyli> colinclark: which pull requests are they? i thought bosmon has merged them
2020-04-14T16:08:48  <Teddy___> cindyli: can you send me the fix for the fs module error when using jsdom
2020-04-14T16:09:12  <cindyli> sure, Teddy___. digging up
2020-04-14T16:09:18  <colinclark> ah you’re right

2020-04-14T16:49:18  <danayo> colinclark, gmoss: is there a reason SJRK stories site security should be prioritised above some of the useability issues? I was going to move it down in the list but wanted to double-check first
2020-04-14T16:49:54  <colinclark> which item?
2020-04-14T16:49:58  <colinclark> oh oh
2020-04-14T16:50:14  <colinclark> no, no reason—except that it needn’t involve anyone but gtirloni to fix, I think
2020-04-14T16:50:15  <colinclark> so it can happen in parallel
2020-04-14T16:50:28  <colinclark> but from a purely functional perspective, you’re entirely right

2020-04-14T17:34:20  <gmoss> colinclark, danayo, michelled: do we have a particular URL in mind? I'm preparing an email to gtirloni with technical details on the work
2020-04-14T17:37:02  <michelled> I'm tempted to say stories.aihec.inclusivedesign.ca what do others think?
2020-04-14T17:37:27  <danayo> +1 michelled
2020-04-14T17:37:48  <michelled> colinclark: do you have an opinion? ^
2020-04-14T17:38:20  <gmoss> michelled: I concur!
2020-04-14T17:38:54  <colinclark> i’ll just catch up sorry
2020-04-14T17:39:06  <colinclark> it’s a lot of dots :)
2020-04-14T17:39:11  <colinclark> but i’m not averse to it
2020-04-14T17:39:14  <gmoss> aihec.inclusivedesign.ca?
2020-04-14T17:39:21  <colinclark> that’d be okay for me
2020-04-14T17:39:41  <gmoss> it would preclude us from making anything else for them at such a friendly URL, but it is a friendly URL :)
2020-04-14T17:39:46  <colinclark> they seem to be calling themselves the “Mixed Media Collective”
2020-04-14T17:39:59  <gmoss> maybe we should confirm with Jutta?
2020-04-14T17:40:07  <colinclark> that might not be a bad thing
2020-04-14T17:40:17  <colinclark> i think let’s just go with aihec.inclusivedesign.ca
2020-04-14T17:40:29  <gmoss> okay, will put that in the email, we can revise as necessary :)
2020-04-14T17:40:40  <michelled> they have their own site, so they probably won't want us to host anything else http://www.aihec.org/
2020-04-14T17:41:52  <colinclark> right
2020-04-14T17:42:47  <colinclark> i almost wonder if we might want to register inclusive-stories.org or something like that
2020-04-14T17:43:03  <gmoss> colinclark: I like that name! is it available?
2020-04-14T17:43:55  <colinclark> it is
2020-04-14T17:44:16  <colinclark> as is inclusive-storytelling.org
2020-04-14T17:44:26  <colinclark> I’ll mention it to gtirloni today when we talk
2020-04-14T17:50:17  <colinclark> gmoss: I just read your email
2020-04-14T17:50:26  <colinclark> I want to be clear: we shouldn’t be scrambling here
2020-04-14T17:50:45  <colinclark> we’re working slow and steady on one thing
2020-04-14T17:50:49  <colinclark> i.e. focussing
2020-04-14T17:50:55  <colinclark> which is perhaps the opposite of scrambling

2020-04-14T18:06:09  <colinclark> wowza that’s a lot of duplication, gmoss

2020-04-14T18:06:45  <gmoss> In fact some of my work in SJRK-289 is removing a large amount of it

2020-04-14T18:30:18  <gmoss> gtirloni: awesome, thanks very much :) feel free to ping me if you have any questions
2020-04-14T18:30:27  <gmoss> I have one for you, when you're ready, but it's not as urgent :)

2020-04-14T18:33:09  <cindyli> got it, gmoss
2020-04-14T18:42:43  <danayo> gmoss: to confirm, I am testing this?  https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/storyEdit.html
2020-04-14T18:43:36  <gmoss> danayo: yep that's the version with the stability fix :)
2020-04-14T18:44:27  <danayo> thanks
2020-04-14T18:52:58  <danayo> gmoss: any stories I publish while testing will be removed overnight, yes?
2020-04-14T18:53:22  <gmoss> danayo: they'll be removed at 22:30 Eastern, I think
2020-04-14T18:53:30  <danayo> thanks
2020-04-14T19:05:12  <greatislander> Hi cindyli, I could take between now and 4pm
2020-04-14T19:05:17  <greatislander> does that work for you?
2020-04-14T19:05:36  <cindyli> yes, meet now in the wecount room? greatislander

2020-04-14T19:17:44  <Teddy___> yeah
2020-04-14T19:17:56  <Teddy___> we count room?
2020-04-14T19:18:54  <michelled> sure!
2020-04-14T19:20:49  <gtirloni> gmoss: i've got the aihc definitions in place but i'm having some trouble with jenkins AND trying to get my access to the AWS console.. but i'm working on that. i'm ready for your question :)
2020-04-14T19:22:09  <gmoss> gtirloni: I saw, thanks for getting those in so quickly!  my question is Jenkins-related, mentioned above. I used to be able to run the backup jobs, but the "Build Now" link doesn't seem to appear any more. if it's a rights restriction, maybe we can talk about it in PM. if it's unintended, I wonder what's going on
2020-04-14T19:22:42  <gmoss> we need to back up each site before we push out the SJRK-335 fix to the other sites. This is, I would say, less important than the AIHEC thing
2020-04-14T19:22:43  <gtirloni> gmoss: probably unintended, and i suspect it might be related to the problem i'm having as well... i'll fix that
2020-04-14T19:22:58  <gmoss> gtirloni: awesome :) if I can be of help just let me know!
2020-04-14T19:23:04  <gtirloni> thanks!

2020-04-14T19:27:31  <gmoss> gtirloni: it worked without issue :)
2020-04-14T19:27:32  <gmoss> thanks!
2020-04-14T19:28:03  <gmoss> cindyli: the remaining SJRK-335 pull requests can be merged in. I'll run browser tests and poke around to confirm the fix works
2020-04-14T19:28:19  <cindyli> ok, gmoss
2020-04-14T19:34:32  <cindyli> all merged, gmoss

2020-04-14T20:01:16  <gmoss> gtirloni: excellent, thanks for the update
2020-04-14T20:01:40  <gmoss> I'm testing the other three versions of the site in the meantime
2020-04-14T20:02:48  <gtirloni> I think I hit the error Alan was having, interesting.. well, that's a start

2020-04-14T20:13:10  <gtirloni> gmoss: I think it's all deployed but the app is restarting because it can't find the config file: `FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Could not find a config file at any of the paths /usr/src/app/sjrk.storyTelling.server.config, /usr/src/app/sjrk.storyTelling.server.config.json, /usr/src/app/sjrk.storyTelling.server.config.json5`
2020-04-14T20:13:58  <gtirloni> gmoss: the folder `sjrk.storyTelling.server.config.json5` seems empty. I'm not sure what's happening but I'm looking around
2020-04-14T20:14:21  <gmoss> gtirloni: sorry, I should have given more detail in my email. two files need to be present in the root, the file you just mentioned and a "secrets.json"
2020-04-14T20:14:50  <gmoss> I'll send you some further detail in an email

2020-04-14T20:25:47  <gmoss> gtirloni: amazing! thanks for that :) colinclark danayo: looks like it's ready for sharing
2020-04-14T20:26:29  <gmoss> gtirloni: Oh one last very important detail! There's a setting on nginx that needs to be updated, will email details (sorry, it just came to mind while I was testing)
2020-04-14T20:29:01  <colinclark> gmoss, gtirloni: nice work
2020-04-14T20:29:12  <colinclark> out of curiosity, how come it shows so many 404s in the console?
2020-04-14T20:29:23  <gmoss> colinclark: that's the resourceLoader doing l10n fallback
2020-04-14T20:29:35  <colinclark> i see
2020-04-14T20:29:58  <gmoss> it's probably 404ing on the files that don't have a locale at the end of the filename
2020-04-14T20:30:13  <gmoss> if it's something else, then we may have a problem haha
2020-04-14T20:31:16  <gtirloni> looks like that
2020-04-14T20:31:28  <colinclark> brutal
2020-04-14T20:31:30  <colinclark> oh well
2020-04-14T20:32:57  <gmoss> another thing that will go away in the future, hopefully
2020-04-14T20:33:09  <colinclark> indeed
2020-04-14T20:34:04  <gmoss> thanks again for your speedy work, gtirloni, I appreciate it
2020-04-14T20:35:46  <gtirloni> thank you
