2020-05-04T19:24:32  <erictheise> apologies if this is inappropriate but Martin Atkins, former drummer for Public Image Ltd, is running a music industry conference via Zoom next weekend and he is looking to contract with an ASL signer for four hours of paid work on Saturday, possibly additional hours on Friday. seemed possible you all might know freelancers looking to pick up extra work.
2020-05-04T19:24:38  <erictheise> the event is https://midwestmusicexpo.com/
2020-05-04T19:25:02  <erictheise> Martin can be contacted at matkins@millikin.edu or via Twitter as @marteeeen.
2020-05-04T19:25:42  <erictheise> one of the people they‚Äôd be signing for is Lol Tolhurst, an early member of The Cure, so sort of cool for any old punks. 8-)
2020-05-04T19:32:04  <gtirloni> üëç
2020-05-04T19:35:39  <gmoss> erictheise: that seems like something that would be perfect to send to the Community mailing list! https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Mailing+Lists
2020-05-04T19:37:48  <erictheise> thanks gmoss did not know about those lists.
2020-05-04T19:37:58  <gmoss> yw!
2020-05-04T19:38:28  <erictheise> can I post without being a member?
2020-05-04T19:38:47  <gmoss> erictheise: you'll have to subscribe to the list in order to send to it
2020-05-04T19:38:50  <gmoss> iirc
2020-05-04T19:43:37  <erictheise> done, thanks.

2020-05-04T21:31:20  <greatislander> FYI erictheise, PCC folks are using a new email address (info@platform.coop is no more). I've updated the Pinecone footer to reflect this. https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/commit/56727894c743eec818f46afc906ccedcbeb80c4b

2020-05-04T22:08:39  <erictheise> greatislander feel free to open an issue or two or pull requests. the footer on the `survey-work` branch should be straight out of the Pinecone documentation but because there actually needs to be a privacy policy and terms of use on the Directory that footer differs on `master`.
2020-05-04T22:09:13  <greatislander> okay, happy to do that. you'll see it incoming later today or tomorrow AM.
2020-05-04T22:09:24  <greatislander> have a good rest of your day!
2020-05-04T22:09:40  <erictheise> all survey all the time.
2020-05-04T22:19:52  <erictheise> greatislander does Pinecone do any styling with the `required` attribute of an `input` tag?
