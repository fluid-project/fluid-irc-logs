2019-12-09T16:22:43  <Justin_o> jhung: would you be able to help me with some images. For the UIO+ icons I need to have a 24x24 size. I suppose in the ownCloud folder that might correspond to 23x23.  https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/apps/files/?dir=/IDRC-Design/Projects/UIO/UIO%20Icon/UIO%20Icon%20Assets&fileid=34133
2019-12-09T16:24:13  <jhung> Sure Justin_o. Which icon in particular do you want resized? There are different colour versions.
2019-12-09T16:25:05  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, specifically the mixed one, but if it's easy to do, we may want to go ahead and do all of them for consistency and in case we need it for the future
2019-12-09T16:28:20  <jhung> Justin_o I'm assuming you need this particular size because you can't resize it using CSS?
2019-12-09T16:29:05  <Justin_o> jhung: yes, it's for the UIO+ extension. You need to provide a range of static sizes and they'll automatically swap between them based on the screen resolution and pixel density I think
2019-12-09T16:54:57  <cherylhjli> jhung greatislander michelled - do you folks want to do a quick PC check in?
