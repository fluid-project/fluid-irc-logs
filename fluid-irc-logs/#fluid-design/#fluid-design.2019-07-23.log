2019-07-23T14:50:32  <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: would you be able to review this PR of mine to address the random syllabification test failures.. the issue seems to be negatively affecting other PRs during their CI checks. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/958

2019-07-23T14:51:45  <cindyli> sure. having a look
2019-07-23T14:59:06  <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks very suspicious to me, but I guess we'll have to go through this in detail ....
2019-07-23T14:59:36  <Bosmon> To start with, there is only one SyllabificationEnactor created in the component tree at one time, right?
2019-07-23T15:00:47  *** danayo_ <danayo_!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-design
2019-07-23T15:01:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that should be the case
2019-07-23T15:01:23  <Justin_o> but there may be multiple pattern files injected based on what languages are available on the page
2019-07-23T15:02:16  <Justin_o> in the tests we load the en-US and en-GB patterns but there are actually three different language codes (en, en-US, and en-CA) that will all actually pull in the en-US pattern.
2019-07-23T15:02:23  <Justin_o> or rather all need to use that pattern
2019-07-23T15:03:29  <Bosmon> Oh yeah
2019-07-23T15:03:33  <Bosmon> I think I see the race
2019-07-23T15:03:57  <Bosmon> Classic "enlatening" bug .... https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/86f543cd916db1aa339a7971d8995d69eb2e7998/src/framework/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactor.js#L166
2019-07-23T15:04:09  <Bosmon> You create this sequence at the point of examining the hyphenators member
2019-07-23T15:04:20  <Bosmon> But then a further one arrives, and you fail to delay the event in order to take account of it

2019-07-23T15:07:06  <Justin_o> hmm.. possibly... although in the case in the test it's that the first one isn't there yet always, so it tries to add it again, but it's actually in the process of being loaded.
2019-07-23T15:08:12  <Justin_o> but maybe what you're mentioning is sort of the mechanism that is causing the error because the sequence is being resolved and triggering the afterSyllabification event when it shouldn't

2019-07-23T16:23:57  <greatislander> It's the latter. WordPress 5.x includes a set of core blocks (listed here: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/block-library/src) and others can be installed via plugins.
