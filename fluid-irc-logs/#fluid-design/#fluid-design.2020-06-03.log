2020-06-03T14:00:32  <Caren_> happy to meet elsewhere!
2020-06-03T14:18:05  <jhung> ping gtirloni are you there?
2020-06-03T14:18:11  <gtirloni> hi
2020-06-03T14:18:51  <jhung> gtirloni I was wondering where I can find the docker container + instructions for getting the Coop Directory dev environment?
2020-06-03T14:26:27  <gtirloni> jhung: you'll need docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2020-06-03T14:27:36  <gtirloni> after you clone the repo, you follow these steps: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/blob/dev/.github/workflows/stack_dev.yml#L29-L35
2020-06-03T14:28:07  <jhung> Awesome. Thanks gtirloni! I'll try to get to that this afternoon. Will ping you if I have any issues.
2020-06-03T14:28:37  <gtirloni> the deploy.env file just contains environment variables, for example:

2020-06-03T14:29:00  <gtirloni> jhung: cool, i'll be around :)
2020-06-03T15:10:17  <Caren_> everyone: something you may find is fun to interact with: https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Experiments
2020-06-03T16:09:20  <cherylhjli> greatislander - did you want to check in?
2020-06-03T16:09:34  <greatislander> yep, gimme 5?
2020-06-03T16:09:36  <gmoss> Caren_: I'm getting a blank page, sadly, and the dev console shows an error :(
2020-06-03T16:10:14  <gmoss> cindyli danayo michelled: I mentioned I'd be going "offline" shortly, but I still intend to do the ST check-in if any/all of you would like to
2020-06-03T16:10:41  <michelled> I'm available
2020-06-03T16:10:51  <gmoss> *at 12:30, i mean
2020-06-03T16:11:00  <gmoss> (now is fine too :))
2020-06-03T16:11:03  <Caren_> oh, no, gmoss. I tried the link on my mac in firefox and it worked. I’m sorry it’s not working for you
2020-06-03T16:11:35  <gmoss> Caren_: it seems to work in Firefox actually, but not Chrome
2020-06-03T16:11:36  <cindyli> gmoss: either now or 12:30 works for me
2020-06-03T16:15:14  <cherylhjli> yep greatislander I can meet, danayo?
2020-06-03T16:19:25  <danayo> cherylhjli, greatislander, will be there in a minute
2020-06-03T16:19:47  <greatislander> ready
2020-06-03T16:35:03  <gmoss> cindyli danayo: we're in standup room if you're able to join us :)
2020-06-03T16:36:23  <danayo> greatislander, cherylhjli - sorry about that, have storytelling meeting now but can check in again after that if needed
2020-06-03T16:36:38  <danayo> greatislander: the profile creation flow looks so great!
2020-06-03T16:37:31  <greatislander> :)
2020-06-03T17:07:27  <gmoss> cindyli danayo michelled: I remembered a thing I meant to mention at our check-in today. I added the minimal testing suite page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Storytelling+Tool+Minimal+Testing+Grid
2020-06-03T17:14:39  <michelled> oh great, thx gmoss
2020-06-03T17:17:25  <michelled> Justin_o: you might find that interesting - gmoss had a very elaborate testing grid for the storytelling tool which meant a week of testing before release. Now that we are moving the smaller releases, we didn't want to spend that amount of time testing each time
2020-06-03T17:20:06  <greatislander> gmoss michelled Justin_o is this all done manually? I have been meaning to experiment with an automated testing tool (e.g. cypress.io) for a while. Would love to look at this some time after the platform co-op project wraps up :)
2020-06-03T17:20:59  <michelled> yeah, it's manual testing right now. There are unit tests that are run on each commit - but it's not quite enough to know if the system as a whole is working
2020-06-03T17:21:39  <michelled> that looks cool greatislander - could save us a lot of time!
2020-06-03T17:21:40  <gmoss> greatislander: yeah it's done manually on each of the devices listed, the idea being some of these would be difficult to automate or put in a VM. For sure some of the tests could be, with improved coverage :)
2020-06-03T17:22:32  <greatislander> My understanding is Cypress and other such tools take a while to set up but once it's done it saves lots of time. wouldn't help with device-specific but it covers Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge) quite nicely.
2020-06-03T17:24:38  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-06-03T17:27:07  <Justin_o> greatislander: here is an example of a manual test plan for an Infusion widget https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Reorderer+QA+Test+Plan+-+Image+Reorderer it would be good to convert something like that into an automated test. I think there will always be some level of a manual testing needed, but having more automation would allow us to test more on merges, as well as minimize the time it would take to
2020-06-03T17:27:07  <Justin_o> do a release.
2020-06-03T17:27:30  <greatislander> would love to work on something like this down the road :)
2020-06-03T17:27:39  <Justin_o> greatislander: please let me know how you get along with cypress or any other tool that you may find yourself trying. the-t-in-rtf has also looked into webdriver
2020-06-03T17:28:10  <greatislander> yeah, webdriver + selenium is another combo I've heard about.
2020-06-03T17:28:16  <greatislander> At Rebus they were using https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/
2020-06-03T17:28:42  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo can we touch base again quickly?
2020-06-03T17:28:47  <greatislander> If you are still both available.
2020-06-03T17:29:11  <Justin_o> greatislander: that looks interesting too, thanks for sharing
2020-06-03T17:35:25  <cherylhjli> greatislander - danayo and I are going thru some designs, ping you after?
2020-06-03T17:36:56  <greatislander> okay. I'm taking off pretty soon. I guess my question is just: what is the canonical order/structure for the individual profile flow? Figma again?
2020-06-03T17:38:55  <greatislander> I want to align them as much as possible between org and individual so I might tweak it a bit if that's okay
2020-06-03T18:07:08  <cherylhjli> you can reference it in figma greatislander
2020-06-03T18:07:30  <cherylhjli> if you have time we can meet now to chat quickly
2020-06-03T18:07:34  <cherylhjli> if not we can chat tomorrow too
2020-06-03T18:10:04  <greatislander> let's chat quickly now
