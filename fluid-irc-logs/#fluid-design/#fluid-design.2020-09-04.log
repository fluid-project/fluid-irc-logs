2020-09-04T13:37:31  <clown> Good morning gtirloni!
2020-09-04T13:38:07  <clown> I saw late yesterday that you changed the infrastructure repositories to use a 'main' branch -- awesome.
2020-09-04T13:38:46  <clown> I think we need to notify anyone who may have cloned those repos and tell them about the change and what they need to do.
2020-09-04T13:38:51  <clown> If that's possible
2020-09-04T13:38:57  <clown> to notify, I mean.
2020-09-04T13:39:29  <clown> What they need to do is documented here, under the heading "Updating local clones":

2020-09-04T13:40:40  <clown> And, I think any of their pull requests need to be re-done to request merging with 'main" now.
2020-09-04T13:47:10  <gtirloni> thanks, will do!
2020-09-04T13:53:18  <clown> thanks gtirloni!
2020-09-04T14:19:17  <greatislander> Hi gmoss! When you are online, I was wondering if you have permissions to create repos in the Fluid Project Github org? I was thinking it would be good to fork Sachin's Eleventy starter there so I can open a couple PRs on it. Let me know :)
2020-09-04T15:31:54  <gmoss> greatislander: I can confirm that I do not have those permissions. I do have permissions in fluid-lab GitHub org, which is where we tend to keep our GSoC repos, but this is a special case and I think it makes more sense to have it in fluid-project
2020-09-04T15:32:25  <greatislander> cindyli perhaps? :)
2020-09-04T15:32:53  <cindyli> let me try...
2020-09-04T15:34:17  <cindyli> greatislander: sorry, i don't have permission to create new repos too
2020-09-04T16:34:21  <gmoss> cindyli: it's just us today, do you want to do a ST check-in? I don't have much to report, basically just preparing for our chat with greatislander :)
2020-09-04T16:34:41  <cindyli> gmoss: let's skip today
2020-09-04T16:34:50  <cindyli> is the chat at 1:30?
2020-09-04T16:35:02  <gmoss> cindyli: I think it's scheduled for "whenever you're free" haha
2020-09-04T16:35:23  <gmoss> but if you want a break after your 1:00 meeting, we can pick a specific time
2020-09-04T16:35:52  <cindyli> thanks very much. i will ping your guys when my 1pm meeting is over
2020-09-04T16:36:00  <cindyli> gmoss, greatislander: ^
2020-09-04T16:36:02  <gmoss> cindyli: sounds good :)
2020-09-04T16:37:21  <greatislander> great cindyli gmoss!
2020-09-04T17:53:23  <cindyli> gmoss, greatislander: i'm ready to meet whenever you are
2020-09-04T17:53:41  <gmoss> cindyli greatislander: i'm good now as well
2020-09-04T17:54:45  <greatislander> great!
