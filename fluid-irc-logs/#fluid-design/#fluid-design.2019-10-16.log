2019-10-16T18:10:21  <greatislander> cherylhjli1 danayo_ jhung did we figure out whether there's going to be a PCC meeting tomorrow?
2019-10-16T18:11:56  <jhung> greatislander, michelled was saying that colinclark may be able to attend
2019-10-16T18:12:35  <greatislander> okay. I notice there's a couple website-related points on there, thinking I could provide a bit of guidance to whoever is participating so that relevant info can be obtained in my absence
2019-10-16T18:12:47  <greatislander> colinclark if you are attending and want to check in quickly about this let me know
2019-10-16T18:14:06  <colinclark> yeah, i can go
2019-10-16T18:14:19  <colinclark> just prime me on whatever i need to convey
2019-10-16T18:14:27  <colinclark> and i will do my besty
2019-10-16T18:14:32  <colinclark> best
2019-10-16T18:15:06  <greatislander> great! email best or do you want to do a 5min call?

2019-10-16T18:23:09  <cherylhjli1> greatislander I was thinking of going to talk to michael about logistics of conference co-design too
2019-10-16T18:23:14  <cherylhjli1> things like room setup, catering, etc etc
2019-10-16T18:23:45  <greatislander> okay cool!
2019-10-16T18:23:55  <greatislander> I can pass on the website info (questions to ask) to you then
2019-10-16T18:24:00  <cherylhjli1> sounds good
2019-10-16T18:27:40  <greatislander> Maybe just before the IDRC website chat at 4?

2019-10-16T19:33:18  <cherylhjli1> danayo_ greatislander jhung: I drafted an email invite to our partners for the co-design potluck, would folks please read this over and edit if anything comes to mind? https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BFQoQ5hoIAzfjqY0vc8xhq20998VPSKp7P9VccIq2o/edit?usp=sharing
2019-10-16T19:35:54  <greatislander> This looks great, cherylhjli1— my only comment would be that it reads a bit like this is the first we are communicating to these partners about the fact that we'll be running a workshop so maybe the intro could begin with something like "As we've discussed in earlier correspondence, the IDRC is going to be…" etc
2019-10-16T19:37:48  <cherylhjli1> lol true! I think we've mentioned it to everyone on that list besides Jordi. I'll add that sentence to everyone else's.
