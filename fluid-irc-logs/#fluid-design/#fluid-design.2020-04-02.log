2020-04-02T15:25:13  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: the colour code of the link text on the figma design for "active tags" on the single views page is #5E82AE, which is the old colour. shall it be changed to the new one - #5c81a9? thanks.
2020-04-02T15:33:57  <lliskovoi_> cindyli: yes, it should be 5c81a9, looks like i didn't change it in a couple of instances. Thanks for spotting it!
2020-04-02T15:36:05  <cindyli> cool. thanks

2020-04-02T16:19:11  <cindyli> lliskovoi_: have you added focus/hover styling for active tags? it's ok if you haven't. just in case you've added but I have trouble finding it on figma
2020-04-02T16:29:22  <lliskovoi_> cindyli: the hover/focus for those is just an underline. I added it to the Figma file

2020-04-02T18:37:17  <cherylhjli> I'm good without a debrief. I'm low key annoyed at the amount of times trebor interrupted everyone but its ok :)
2020-04-02T18:37:27  <danayo> i’m with you cherylhjli
2020-04-02T18:37:45  <danayo> I’m going to drink MORE COFFEE
2020-04-02T18:37:50  <colinclark> :) :)
2020-04-02T18:37:52  <cherylhjli> hahahha
2020-04-02T18:37:57  <colinclark> we’re all with you
2020-04-02T18:38:23  <greatislander> +1
2020-04-02T18:38:38  <greatislander> cherylhjli meet in 20 min, coop room? for tool library stuff?
2020-04-02T18:38:45  <cherylhjli> yep
2020-04-02T18:38:52  <greatislander> sweet
2020-04-02T18:39:39  <danayo> greatislander, cherylhjli meeting is at 3:30ET, no?
2020-04-02T18:40:04  <greatislander> oh yeah, so it is
2020-04-02T18:40:14  <danayo> ok cool, just need to fit in a short dog walk
2020-04-02T18:43:43  <cherylhjli> ok!
2020-04-02T18:45:07  <colinclark> i think our compromise can be quite simple… a small “meta-header” with the twin pines icon...
2020-04-02T18:45:45  <colinclark> and then a bit more branding for the resource library (perhaps its own icon) that is more prominent in the same spot (and with the same function) as the current pines icon
2020-04-02T18:47:04  <colinclark> It’s perhaps not ideal, but I think it addresses a legitimate issue, which is that some people may not quite see that, if we’re uising twin pines icon, that they’ve gone “somewhere else”
2020-04-02T18:47:23  <colinclark> does that seem viable to you in some form, cherylhjli?
2020-04-02T18:48:45  <colinclark> perhaps we can integrate greatislander’s dog into the icon for the resource library
2020-04-02T18:48:52  <greatislander> ^^
2020-04-02T18:51:48  <danayo> +1 colinclark
2020-04-02T18:59:54  <greatislander> colinclark cherylhjli are you both available to discuss this quickly?
2020-04-02T19:00:12  <colinclark> i am, i just need 30 seconds
2020-04-02T19:00:17  <greatislander> or, sometime between now and 3:30
2020-04-02T19:00:37  <cherylhjli> sorry i just got back from washing dishes
2020-04-02T19:00:43  <cherylhjli> yeah, something like that sounds good
2020-04-02T19:00:44  <greatislander> no worries
2020-04-02T19:00:45  <cherylhjli> +1 for aisha
