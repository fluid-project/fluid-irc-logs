2020-01-14T21:20:22  <michelled> Lisa is going to work on the visual design over the next little while
2020-01-14T21:21:25  <michelled> Justin_o: I just put in the OT student placement offers. I'm expected two students this summer that will work together on the C2LC project
2020-01-14T21:22:29  <greatislander> Thanks michelled!
2020-01-14T21:22:40  <michelled> np
2020-01-14T21:22:44  <Justin_o> michelled: that's great, we've had such good experiences with the OT students.
2020-01-14T21:22:53  <michelled> yeah!
2020-01-14T21:23:00  <Justin_o> also thanks for the designs.. will Lisa be annotating them with the a11y info too?
2020-01-14T21:23:22  <michelled> she will likely be doing that Justin_o - for now she's given ted some ARIA reading to do
2020-01-14T21:23:50  <michelled> Justin_o: we could actually get more OT students, but I think the mentorship burden will be too high
2020-01-14T21:23:59  <michelled> we can consider it for years we don't do gsoc maybe
2020-01-14T21:25:20  <Justin_o> michelled: sure, too bad the applications seem to be at a similar time.. or can we modify it later? We'll find out if we've been accepted as a GSoC org on Feb 20
