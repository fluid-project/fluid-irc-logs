2020-03-23T16:47:25  <colinclark> greatislander: yeah i’m around
2020-03-23T16:47:28  <colinclark> i need a few minutes
2020-03-23T16:47:38  <greatislander> sure thing, just send us a Zoom link when you're ready
2020-03-23T16:47:43  <colinclark> trying to get an organizational bio for IDRC in time for a grant deadline
2020-03-23T16:47:48  <colinclark> almost finished
2020-03-23T16:48:24  <colinclark> and I think that text you just highlighted should be good for the website :)
2020-03-23T16:50:08  <greatislander> :)
2020-03-23T16:51:46  <greatislander> alanharnum or others: what's the best link to the CISL project? This is what's on the IDRC site: http://www.cast.org/whats-new/news/2017/center-for-inclusive-software-for-learning.html
2020-03-23T16:52:17  <alanharnum> greatislander: http://cisl.cast.org/
2020-03-23T16:52:24  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-03-23T16:52:38  <greatislander> also Justin_o or jhung, is there a good canonical link for UI Options?
2020-03-23T16:53:17  <Justin_o> greatislander: hmm.. what's the audience?
2020-03-23T16:53:27  <greatislander> Someone visiting the IDRC site
2020-03-23T16:53:45  <Justin_o> greatislander: I suppose in time it will be the lunchbox so maybe https://floeproject.org/ui-options.html
2020-03-23T16:54:00  <greatislander> awesome, thanks
2020-03-23T16:54:14  <colinclark> yikes
2020-03-23T16:54:18  <greatislander> And gmoss, does the Storytelling tool have its own page?
2020-03-23T16:54:19  <colinclark> we need to work on that page :)

2020-03-23T16:56:35  <gmoss> greatislander: sorry, looking for context for your question
2020-03-23T16:56:55  <gmoss> greatislander: do you mean "does the Storytelling Tool have a page dedicated to it"?
2020-03-23T16:56:58  <greatislander> oh yeah so it's listed on the "Tools" section of the new IDRC mini site
2020-03-23T16:57:18  <greatislander> so I'm wondering if it has a page that talks about it as a tool apart from the stories.sojustrepairit.org page
2020-03-23T16:57:46  <greatislander> so gmoss, yes to your helpful reframing of my question :)
2020-03-23T16:58:26  <Justin_o> colinclark: i think this is just the start, we need to get a bunch of stuff in place. I'm trying to remember now, but I think part of the issue is that there are a lot of changes coming to UIO, and we need to get the docs fixed up.
2020-03-23T16:58:27  <gmoss> greatislander: there's more information on at least one of the contexts at stories.floeproject.org, and the rest is basically just spread across various wiki pages but centred on this hub: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Web+Storytelling+Tools
2020-03-23T16:58:49  <greatislander> ah okay, the first link seems good
2020-03-23T16:59:04  <Justin_o> colinclark: also, I think this page or what will be on it in the future will be in the new IDRC site, so there might be some designs there that we haven't gotten to yet, but I could be mistake on that.
2020-03-23T16:59:10  <gmoss> greatislander: there's info on the hosted versions here: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/docs/BRANCHES.md
2020-03-23T16:59:56  <gmoss> greatislander: it's an interesting question to ask haha.. since it's a tool we've used in several different contexts now, there's the matter of separating the software used from the work done
2020-03-23T16:59:57  <colinclark> I think the Floe storytelling site is probably the best place to link to, gmoss and greatislander
2020-03-23T17:00:04  <gmoss> colinclark: I agree
2020-03-23T17:00:07  <greatislander> that makes sense to me

2020-03-23T17:02:59  <michelled> danielcho: shall we check in?
