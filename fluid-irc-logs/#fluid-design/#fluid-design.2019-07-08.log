2019-07-08T15:08:30  <jhung> michelled, greatislander, cherylhjli - I see on the calendar there's a pending Coop design crit tomorrow with Max?
2019-07-08T15:09:16  <cherylhjli> jhung - the design crit isn't our IDRC design crit, but rather these small meetings we've been doing with folks in the platform coop community to get their feedback on things
2019-07-08T15:09:55  <cherylhjli> pending because I think as a team we still need to clarify what time is best to meet Max, this time isn't confirmed yet :)
2019-07-08T15:10:39  <jhung> cherylhjli ok awesome. Thanks! :)
2019-07-08T15:18:44  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: shall we do a storytelling check-in?
2019-07-08T15:19:13  <cindyli> sure, gmoss
2019-07-08T15:19:15  <michelled> sure!
2019-07-08T15:19:41  <gmoss> michelled cindyli shall we go in fluid_standup?
2019-07-08T15:19:44  <michelled> yup
2019-07-08T15:19:47  <cindyli> ok
2019-07-08T15:20:13  <cindyli> my internet is super slow today
2019-07-08T15:20:23  <cindyli> failed to join
2019-07-08T15:20:25  <cindyli> trying again
2019-07-08T15:21:20  <gmoss> cindyli: okay, hopefully it sorts itself out!
2019-07-08T15:21:48  <gmoss> I forgot we decided to do 3:30 instead
2019-07-08T15:21:53  <gmoss> we can try again then?

2019-07-08T15:37:12  <danayo_> cherylhjli: do you know what the coop “pre-meeting meeting” is that I see in the calendar on Wednesday?
2019-07-08T15:38:22  <cherylhjli> danayo_ - yeah, so last week we were mentioning whether / how we should bring up a few things on the website, ie the "vision & advantages" and the new copy about the origination of platform cooperativism… the meeting is to chat through how we want to approach those conversations
2019-07-08T15:39:16  <danayo_> thanks
2019-07-08T15:47:17  <danayo_> cherylhjli: where can I find the QA tickets?
2019-07-08T15:47:44  <cherylhjli> danayo_: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pcc/issues
2019-07-08T15:47:55  <danayo_> thanks
2019-07-08T15:48:13  <cherylhjli> danayo_ greatislander want to check in on QA tickets right now?

2019-07-08T15:48:32  <cherylhjli> my room?
2019-07-08T15:48:36  <greatislander> k!
2019-07-08T15:49:03  <danayo_> cherylhjli, greatislander I could really use a coffee but don’t want to hold you up - so will join asap
2019-07-08T15:49:36  <cherylhjli> ok!
2019-07-08T15:50:40  <jhung> cherylhjli and greatislander should I join you?

2019-07-08T16:28:24  <jhung> greatislander here are two articles I used to talk about semantic structure (includes use of headings). https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML
2019-07-08T16:29:07  <jhung> May be good for web devs, but not sure if appropriate for the audience you had in mind.
2019-07-08T16:43:28  <danayo_> alanharnum I’m looking for a prototyping tool that creates really sketchy looking prototypes, and I thought maybe it was you that sent a link to something a while back?
2019-07-08T16:44:19  <greatislander> @danayo_ maybe it was me?
2019-07-08T16:44:27  <alanharnum> danayo_: It might have been https://balsamiq.com
2019-07-08T16:44:35  <danayo_> greatislander: thanks, it’s not balsamiq
2019-07-08T16:44:45  <danayo_> oops
2019-07-08T16:44:49  <greatislander> https://wiredjs.com/
2019-07-08T16:44:56  <greatislander> This is the one I was talking about
2019-07-08T16:45:02  <greatislander> A month or two ago…
2019-07-08T16:45:30  <danayo_> greatislander: fabulous that’s the one - I thought it was before your IDRC time :)
2019-07-08T16:45:35  <danayo_> thanks alanharnum
2019-07-08T16:45:39  <greatislander> early days :)

2019-07-08T16:48:39  <greatislander> @jhung I like those but I think this might be more appropriate for the audience: https://yoast.com/how-to-use-headings-on-your-site/
2019-07-08T16:50:23  <caren> jhung: do you recall where the 25th anniversary photos are housed on ownCloud? I’m looking for images of our work photographed on screens and thought there were some from the event
2019-07-08T16:51:27  <michelled> cherylhjli, danayo_, greatislander, jhung: I've opened my room for our 1:00 meeting
2019-07-08T16:52:08  <greatislander> Thanks michelled, see you soon!
2019-07-08T16:54:00  <jhung> greatislander awesome! I like that article. A lot less technical. I'll add that to my bookmarks.
2019-07-08T16:56:23  <jhung> caren yes I think they're on OwnCloud under IDRC-Event-Images -> 25th anniversary.
2019-07-08T16:57:54  <caren> jhung: that folder doesn’t seem to show up for me. Maybe it got moved. I’ll look.
2019-07-08T16:59:00  <caren> jhung: got it…I was in the Events folder
