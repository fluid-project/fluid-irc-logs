2020-06-26T14:23:12  <jhung> cherylhjli got a minute to take a look at the styling of the stories listing?
2020-06-26T14:27:08  <cherylhjli> yep one second!
2020-06-26T14:27:28  <jhung> ok I'll be in coop
2020-06-26T15:20:48  <greatislander> Hi cherylhjli, is there a full list of tool categories/subcategories somewhere?
2020-06-26T15:21:04  <greatislander> I checked the synonym ringâ€¦ but I feel like there was a different list somewhere else
2020-06-26T15:21:44  <cherylhjli> yep greatislander

2020-06-26T15:25:13  <greatislander> thanks cherylhjli. is there a reason we removed budgeting?
2020-06-26T15:26:37  <cherylhjli> no, don't think so! must've slipped through - let's add it back in
2020-06-26T15:26:54  <greatislander> okay thanks
2020-06-26T15:52:13  <greatislander> alanharnum I would suggest setting aside the styling issue with full width and prioritizing search if that works for you
2020-06-26T15:53:38  <alanharnum> greatislander: yup, works for me - I'll pivot onto that for afternoon. Pushed up what I've got done so far at https://coop-tool-library-b1qmnnwmj.vercel.app/
