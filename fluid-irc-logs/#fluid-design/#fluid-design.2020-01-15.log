2020-01-15T17:12:32  <jhung> greatislander erictheise In theory I quite like the decentralized approach - similar to how Google would populate their own results and you can claim it and update the item with updated info. When you update the info it would be good to get a structured data (schema.org md) that you can copy and paste into the website you run.
2020-01-15T17:12:53  <greatislander> +1
2020-01-15T17:12:58  <erictheise> agreed.
2020-01-15T17:13:27  <jhung> In theory it sounds nice. I'll be curious to see how it plays out as a user experience.
2020-01-15T17:13:42  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: danayo)
2020-01-15T17:17:54  <erictheise> But I still think the decentralized upkeep/maintenance needs to integrate with an initial centralized relational data model for accounts, associated organizations, profiles, roles, interests, needs, geo, etc. I'm going to try and tease that out of Cheryl's mocks once I've gotten all the way through the video recording.

2020-01-15T17:36:46  <danayo> Caren_: yes for sure
2020-01-15T17:37:44  <michelled> erictheise: you might want to join this mailing list - it's pretty low traffic https://lists.inclusivedesign.ca/mailman/listinfo/platform-coop-development-kit
2020-01-15T17:38:46  <danayo> jhung can you say more about why you think zoom breakout groups won’t be useful for remote co-design?
2020-01-15T17:40:03  <jhung> danayo my comment was about them not being practical for scheduling multiple meetings that occur at the same time. They're perfectly fine as a tool to split a single meeting into two sub groups.
2020-01-15T17:40:41  <danayo> ah, thanks jhung, I misunderstood
