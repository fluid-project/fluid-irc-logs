2020-05-12T17:40:20  <greatislander> we should check in. I don't know if we can properly do planning but it would be good to touch base.

2020-05-12T17:57:19  <gtirloni> greatislander: website activated, could you verify it looks as expected? i've already enabled the redirects
2020-05-12T17:59:47  <greatislander> looking good, gtirloni!
2020-05-12T17:59:55  <gtirloni> greatislander: also, i'd like to add a redirect from idrc.ocad.ca -> idrc.ocadu.ca, do you know where I can do that in the WP admin panel? ---> https://idrc.ocad.ca/* https://idrc.ocadu.ca/:splat 301!
2020-05-12T18:00:21  <greatislander> sorry, not sure I follow
2020-05-12T18:00:30  <greatislander> oooh
2020-05-12T18:00:37  <greatislander> You mean for the new site?
2020-05-12T18:01:03  <gtirloni> yep
2020-05-12T18:01:09  <gtirloni> it's something we had on the old site
2020-05-12T18:01:28  <gtirloni> because there are a lot of idrc.OCAD.ca links out there, and we redirect them all to idrc.OCADU.ca
2020-05-12T18:01:32  <greatislander> Going into a meeting right now but I can look at this after
2020-05-12T18:01:37  <gtirloni> cool, no rush

2020-05-12T20:43:51  <gmoss> ooo gotcha
2020-05-12T20:44:23  <gmoss> it probably doesn't look that way in Edge 79+
