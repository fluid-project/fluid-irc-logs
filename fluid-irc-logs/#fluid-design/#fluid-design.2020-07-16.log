2020-07-16T16:46:37  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o michelled: shall we do ST check-in?
2020-07-16T16:46:47  <gmoss> or do we need a break?
2020-07-16T16:46:55  <cindyli> i'm fine either way
2020-07-16T16:46:57  <gmoss> same
2020-07-16T16:48:34  <michelled> I'm available
2020-07-16T16:48:46  <danayo> yes
2020-07-16T16:50:02  <gmoss> okay, we're in the Standup room
2020-07-16T19:06:40  <michelled> danielcho: so, I should be able to drag movements into my program - should I also be able to drag them out?
2020-07-16T19:07:25  <danielcho> michelled: no, just drag them in
2020-07-16T19:07:40  <sbates> you need to use the control panel to remove
2020-07-16T19:07:44  <sbates> michelled ^
2020-07-16T19:08:30  <michelled> cool, thx
2020-07-16T19:10:00  <michelled> sbates: when you said test with a screenreader, did you mean the self voicing or the basic interface?
2020-07-16T19:11:01  <sbates> michelled: with VoiceOver or other screen reader
2020-07-16T19:11:51  <sbates> the audio feedback that we have is limited and isn't a full self-voicing interface
2020-07-16T19:12:09  <sbates> it's more an augmentation to the visual interface
2020-07-16T19:16:27  <michelled> I think it's working well with voiceover on the ipad - my main issue is that I'm not sure how people use voiceover on an ipad
2020-07-16T19:16:34  <michelled> I'm tapping things and they are being read out
2020-07-16T19:17:54  <michelled> oh, I see - you swipe :)
2020-07-16T19:18:11  <michelled> I guess I know what I want lisa to cover when she does her lightening talk ;)
2020-07-16T19:38:29  <michelled> danielcho, sbates: I think I'm done testing unless there's something else you want to me test out
2020-07-16T20:06:07  <danayo> gmoss, Justin_o, cindyli here’s what I’ve written up about creating links with markdown for the Story Tool How-to, feel free to edit or comment https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWxeffufTxBv48H6WOuqy29oz2-u0x5YVTI7xt_N9GE/edit?usp=sharing
2020-07-16T20:06:44  <cindyli> thanks, danayo
2020-07-16T20:10:16  <gmoss> thanks danayo :) taking a look right now
2020-07-16T20:18:37  <gmoss> danayo: I think it looks great! assuming everyone else approves, I'll start adding it into the how-to story in code
2020-07-16T20:18:54  <gmoss> I actually didn't know about the link title feature, so I learned a thing :)
2020-07-16T20:19:15  <danayo> 8)
2020-07-16T20:20:14  <danayo> gmoss: wasn’t entirely sure if this is accurate about link titles: “which in some browsers will appear on hover, and will be read by screen readers”
2020-07-16T20:20:41  <gmoss> danayo: I suppose that's worth testing a little before we include it. I'll try it out with NVDA real quick
2020-07-16T20:24:07  <danayo> gmoss: I think I’ll add a link to this to the help doc https://www.nngroup.com/articles/title-attribute/
2020-07-16T20:26:29  <gmoss> danayo: that sounds like a good idea! NVDA announces the title in Edge 44, Chrome 84 and Firefox 78, btw
2020-07-16T20:26:41  <danayo> thanks gmoss
2020-07-16T20:29:43  <gmoss> danayo: Where do you feel this new content should be placed within the how-to story? Between "Remove Content Blocks" and "Add Descriptions (Metadata) to Content Blocks" seems to me like a good place
2020-07-16T20:30:53  <gmoss> since the flow of the instructions seem to be something like: "how to add blocks", "how to manipulate blocks", "how to fill in blocks", "how to fill in other details", "how to publish and see your story", and "bugs"
2020-07-16T20:31:47  <danayo> good question gmoss, since we refer to the description field, let’s put it after that, and before “Add Story Title...
2020-07-16T20:31:49  <danayo> "
2020-07-16T20:33:10  <gmoss> danayo: sure, sounds good!
2020-07-16T20:34:10  <gmoss> I like the fact that this instruction set is itself a story, though as we add more and more content to it, I wonder if it makes sense to make it its own full-fledged page
2020-07-16T20:34:15  <gmoss> not today, of course
2020-07-16T20:36:47  <danayo> yep gmoss
