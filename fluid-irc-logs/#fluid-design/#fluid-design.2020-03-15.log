2020-03-15T05:38:45  <Shoaib_IN> gmoss I was hoping to work on Migrating to Modern Static Site Generator project as a GSOC-2020 intern. I have experience with web development but not with DocPad. Is the intern going to work on both FLOE and Fluid projects?
2020-03-15T05:39:54  <Shoaib_IN> or are you going to hand the project to multiple interns
