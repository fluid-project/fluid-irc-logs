2020-05-21T16:30:17  <michelled1> should be - just in a meeting that isn't quite done
2020-05-21T16:30:23  <gmoss> no worries!
2020-05-21T16:30:24  <cindyli> sure
2020-05-21T16:30:38  <danayo> gmoss, michelled1 I need a few minutes after this - perhaps we can say 12:45?
2020-05-21T16:30:47  <danayo> cindyli ^
2020-05-21T16:31:08  <gmoss> danayo: sure, 12:45 works, though we'll have to keep it brief as I'll need the room for the Community Meeting at 1:00 EDT

2020-05-21T16:35:03  <colinclark> danayo, there’s also Revathi from CoLab…
2020-05-21T16:35:21  <colinclark> who has been investigating joint EU/Canada funding opportunities, all related to elder care in particualr
2020-05-21T16:35:52  <colinclark> i’ve been losing track of more emails than I’d like to admit, but I’m meeting with her tomorrow to talk about a few options
2020-05-21T16:36:02  <colinclark> so that’s another place where we’d really want to bring Equal Care in
2020-05-21T16:36:23  <colinclark> especially if it’s still viable for UK groups to participate in European-focused projects
2020-05-21T16:40:11  <danayo> colinclark: for sure, that sounds good
2020-05-21T16:41:58  <danayo> colinclark: I wonder…is there any possible path for bringing CoRise and EqualCare in on the same project? Could be some useful overlap
2020-05-21T16:42:21  <danayo> or maybe things are too different in US and UK for it to be useful
2020-05-21T16:45:45  <colinclark> I really don’t know, but let’s see
2020-05-21T16:46:03  <colinclark> if we get a better sense of Anne’s priorities’ that will help
2020-05-21T16:46:43  <danayo> for sure colinclark

2020-05-21T17:58:48  <cherylhjli> michelled1 did he say specifically what kind? did he want to see things?
2020-05-21T17:59:04  <michelled1> cherylhjli: I think just a quick summary is fine
2020-05-21T17:59:14  <michelled1> unless there are things you feel like showing
2020-05-21T17:59:23  <cherylhjli> no that's great, thanks :)
2020-05-21T18:26:48  <gtirloni> erictheise greatislander: Hi! Do you know from where I can get the scratch/cmdi.sql.bz2 file for the coop directory site?
2020-05-21T18:28:15  <erictheise> short term solution, gtirloni, I will email it to you. what is your address?
2020-05-21T18:28:26  <gtirloni> gtirloni@ocadu.ca
2020-05-21T18:28:28  <gtirloni> thanks a lot
2020-05-21T18:29:17  <erictheise> medium term solution: either move the site from my AWS account to heroku or wherever and manage it from there or give me your AWS pem identities so you can log in. been waiting on greatislander’s for weeks, need jhung’s when he gets back, need yours.
2020-05-21T18:33:01  <greatislander> sorry erictheise, I wasn't clear on what's needed to convert my existing key to PEM format and it fell off my radar. I assume the instructions are those here? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws
2020-05-21T18:33:48  <greatislander> I guess the easiest is to generate a new private/public key pair in the PEM format rather than trying to convert my existing key, so I'll do that.

2020-05-21T22:29:35  <erictheise> was glad to see the split divider had been added, hoping their are no ill effects on radio buttons and checkboxes WRT the directory.

2020-05-21T22:31:49  <erictheise> a PR for getting releases via npm would satisfy a need, greatislander, if you have the cycles.
