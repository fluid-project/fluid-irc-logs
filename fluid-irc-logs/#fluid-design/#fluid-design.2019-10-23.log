2019-10-23T19:30:35  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: quick design question... for the orator component when you select some text on a page.. if you scroll the page would you rather have the button stay in the same place and have the content scroll behind it, or do you want it to scroll with selected content on the page?
2019-10-23T19:30:42  <Justin_o> you can test out the current demo of the orator here https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/orator/
2019-10-23T19:37:37  <cindyli1> i vote for the former

2019-10-23T20:07:20  <cindyli> Justin_o: having button stay at the top gives a feel of top menu bar where someone can always approach to for actions needed
2019-10-23T20:08:15  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. I guess we might want to consider that as part of a redesign, which I think we may want to do at some point.
2019-10-23T20:08:58  <cindyli> ok
2019-10-23T20:09:14  <Justin_o> There is a persistent button at the top of the page, although it's not fixed or sticky, but it controls only the page level reading at the moment. I think there is some talk about having that button and the "pop up" one performing the same action, and either reading from the top of the page or from the selection
2019-10-23T20:09:35  <Justin_o> I think that would be more of something that you would like, is that correct?
2019-10-23T20:11:22  <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2019-10-23T20:11:23  <cindyli> that's true, more consistent behavior of 2 buttons
2019-10-23T20:13:58  <Justin_o> thanks
2019-10-23T20:14:05  <Justin_o> for the feedback
2019-10-23T20:15:27  <gmoss> cindyli michelled yes sorry! I got into the zone and didn't notice your messages. I just rebooted my computer, ready in a minute or two!
