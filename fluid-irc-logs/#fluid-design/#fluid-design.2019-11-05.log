2019-11-05T15:08:29  <colinclark> ok
2019-11-05T15:08:30  <avtar> are you getting started with the iteration meeting?

2019-11-05T15:08:55  <danielcho> soon I think
2019-11-05T15:10:00  <michelled> avtar: when do you think your call will be done?
2019-11-05T15:10:30  <avtar> i think by 10:30
2019-11-05T15:17:50  <colinclark> I have an 11 am meeting I can’t get out of
2019-11-05T15:18:08  <michelled> colinclark: do you want to be at planning this week?
2019-11-05T15:18:26  <colinclark> which planning
2019-11-05T15:18:31  <colinclark> it’s tuesday, i’m confused
2019-11-05T15:18:31  <michelled> C2LC
2019-11-05T15:18:39  <colinclark> yes
2019-11-05T15:18:41  <colinclark> I’d like to
2019-11-05T15:18:48  <michelled> ok, what time works?
2019-11-05T15:19:05  <colinclark> 18 minutes ago worked pretty good :)
2019-11-05T15:19:08  <colinclark> but noon should be fine
2019-11-05T15:19:26  <michelled> IDRC planning might not quite be done
2019-11-05T15:19:38  <michelled> but we can starte C2LC planning right after
2019-11-05T15:19:51  <michelled> simonjb, avtar, danielcho, sepidehshahi: does that work for you?
2019-11-05T15:20:09  <simonjb> I'll need to get lunch after IDRC planning
2019-11-05T15:20:31  <simonjb> or skip the end
2019-11-05T15:20:43  <simonjb> and we had planned to meet at 1:30
2019-11-05T15:22:18  <simonjb> I can be ready at 12 with food for C2LC planning and then bump our other meeting to 2? that gives 1 hour C2LC planning and 1 hour meta-planning before 3
2019-11-05T15:22:34  <simonjb> with a break 1-2
2019-11-05T15:23:06  <simonjb> or 1:30-2 if C2LC planning goes 1.5 hours
2019-11-05T15:23:13  <danielcho> michelled: 12 works for me too
2019-11-05T15:23:30  <michelled> we can start it as close to 12 as possible but of course I can't rush IDRC planning
2019-11-05T15:32:34  <avtar> we're done our call
2019-11-05T15:32:49  <avtar> sorry, all.. it took longer than we expected
2019-11-05T15:33:21  <avtar> noon works for me as well
2019-11-05T15:33:37  <sepidehshahi> noon should be fine for me
2019-11-05T15:34:55  <michelled> ok great - let's make it noon
2019-11-05T15:35:00  <michelled> noonish

2019-11-05T16:06:44  <michelled> Justin_o: thx for making the Floe news story for Caren - we've moved to a process where if you want review on something particular for the site you should ask someone about that and otherwise you should go ahead and merge it yourself
2019-11-05T16:06:48  <clown> michelled:  we can use vidyo, I don't have any preference.  Others might.
2019-11-05T16:13:42  <Justin_o> michelled: thanks. I'd like to get Caren to look it over first, to make sure it's what she wanted.
2019-11-05T16:13:52  <Justin_o> clown, michelled: I'd prefer to use zoom if that's okay
2019-11-05T16:14:08  <michelled> great Justin_o and yeah, let's use zoom
