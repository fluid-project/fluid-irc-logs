2019-12-19T15:48:33  <simonjb> yes danielcho
2019-12-19T15:48:37  <danielcho> got it!
2019-12-19T15:48:43  <alanharnum> simonjb: thanks, will have a look this aft; might not have time to finish until tomorrow, trying to wrap up some stuff
2019-12-19T15:48:54  <simonjb> and I will delete the dev-0.1 branch from the upstream rep

2019-12-19T16:54:19  <jhung> gmoss could you be running Acrylic? Try disabling that service and reboot.
2019-12-19T16:54:41  <greatislander> justin_o are you available to chat with me and Teddy_?
2019-12-19T16:54:49  <gmoss> jhung: that was one of the things we tried yesterday. I disabled Acrylic and reset my DNS settings, no effect :(
2019-12-19T16:54:58  <gmoss> though I didn't reboot, perhaps that was it
2019-12-19T16:55:18  <gmoss> I even added an entry to my hosts file explicitly linking 127.0.0.1 to localhost
2019-12-19T16:55:36  *** clown_mtg is now known as clown
2019-12-19T16:55:41  <gmoss> jhung: if it were Acrylic then it wouldn't work in incognito, though, right?
2019-12-19T16:58:41  <jhung> gmoss I'm not sure how Acrylic would affect incognito. Rebooting can't hurt especially if you've tried multiple things already. :)
2019-12-19T16:59:05  <gmoss> jhung: very true, especially with Windows being Windows :) I'll give it a shot tomorrow when I'm using my work machine (on my desktop today)
2019-12-19T16:59:16  <jhung> ok cool.
2019-12-19T16:59:37  <jhung> greatislander michelled danayo should we check in on Co-op?
2019-12-19T16:59:40  <gmoss> jhung: thanks for the help :)

2019-12-19T17:01:33  <danayo> jhung: I don’t have anything in particular to check in about, but am happy to if others want/need!
2019-12-19T17:02:00  <jhung> wondering about this afternoon's meeting
2019-12-19T17:02:07  <danayo> yeah I was just going to say
2019-12-19T17:02:15  <danayo> wonder if we need to check in before that about anything?
2019-12-19T17:02:50  <jhung> I'm not sure either danayo - maybe worth a quick checkin to figure that out?
2019-12-19T17:02:59  <danayo> I know we wanted to ask Trebor about the map/directory survey results
2019-12-19T17:04:52  <danayo> greatislander, michelled? ^

2019-12-19T17:55:13  <cindyli> fine with me
2019-12-19T17:55:23  <gmoss> michelled cindyli: works for me too!
2019-12-19T17:56:39  <gmoss> I've worked in Bosmon's latest dev release from today, and it didn't seem to introduce any new issues. I got most of the base page tests to pass last night, but the very last check was failing, where it tried to drop the cookie by setting the expiry date to epoch. this used to work but doesn't seem to any more. And now, mysteriously, the cookie test sequence doesn't even get that far, and is hanging waiting for the
2019-12-19T17:56:39  <gmoss> cookieStore.events.onWriteResponse event
2019-12-19T17:56:45  <gmoss> so that's what I'm looking into at the moment
2019-12-19T17:57:17  <gmoss> I think the Edit and Browse page tests also need some adjustment, so I may do this while I let my subconscious pick away at the cookie conundrum
2019-12-19T17:57:38  <michelled> odd, has the cookiestore changed at all with the new updates?
2019-12-19T17:58:06  <gmoss> michelled: I switched back to the previous dev release from a couple of days ago, that had no effect
2019-12-19T17:59:44  <gmoss> but it's possible, actually pretty likely, that changes in FLUID-6148/6145 have affected things
2019-12-19T18:00:20  <michelled> I'm assuming the cookiestore tests themselves are passing fine?
2019-12-19T18:02:54  <gmoss> michelled: I'll have to check, I don't usually run the Infusion tests
2019-12-19T18:04:01  <greatislander> danayo, jhung, michelled, colinclark -- Michael indicated that they don't need a co-op meeting today. I think we can probably send a couple notes/questions by email and do without. Thoughts?
2019-12-19T18:04:12  <michelled> sounds good
2019-12-19T18:04:23  <jhung> Works for me.
2019-12-19T18:04:38  <colinclark> Seems ok to me
2019-12-19T18:04:42  <colinclark> too bad they cancelled
2019-12-19T18:07:45  <michelled> gmoss: probably worth checking they pass for you just in case
2019-12-19T18:07:58  <gmoss> michelled: on it :)
2019-12-19T18:11:01  <gmoss> michelled: I'm going to bring this discussion to #fluid-work since this is more programming related than design hah
