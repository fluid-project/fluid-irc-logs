2019-01-31T15:30:56  <cherylhjli> michelled: yes that you for the reminder! sending now
2019-01-31T15:31:08  <michelled> thx!
2019-01-31T15:31:53  <cherylhjli> michelled: https://invis.io/JMPX498CW7H#/344034811_26_-_Conference
2019-01-31T15:31:59  <cherylhjli> This screen and the next 3 screens
2019-01-31T15:34:10  <michelled> cherylhjli: when you say the next 3 screens, do you mean Program and Participants?

2019-01-31T15:34:48  <cherylhjli> yes, and the page titled "lecture - joseph blasi" - that is a detail page if you click into an event from the program page.
2019-01-31T15:35:47  *** caren <caren!carenwatki@nat/ocadu/x-tzwyapdcezsscpgr> has joined #fluid-design
2019-01-31T15:37:34  <michelled> cherylhjli: the only part I'm not certain about is the actual conference schedule. I think for that we will use an existing plugin so the details of how it would look might not be easily modified
2019-01-31T15:37:50  <michelled> but I think we can just say that to Trebor - I'm happy with you showing this to him today
2019-01-31T15:39:09  <cherylhjli> michelled: Yes, that makes sense - agree that we can show this to trebor and caveat with that little bit around how it will look. Out of curiosity, can you expand a bit more on what plugin that section may use?
2019-01-31T15:40:39  <michelled> cherylhjli: possible something like this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/conference-scheduler/
2019-01-31T15:43:03  <cherylhjli> thanks michelled!
2019-01-31T15:44:03  <michelled> cherylhjli: or maybe this: https://mpttdemo.getmotopress.com/
2019-01-31T15:45:50  <cherylhjli> michelled: and just so I can understand plugins, is the purpose of using a plugin just so that it's way faster and easier to implement?
2019-01-31T15:46:21  <michelled> yes and so that we aren't creating a lot of code that would need to be maintained by the site maintainer
2019-01-31T15:47:26  <michelled> that's an important consideration for this site since we will not be maintaining it long term

2019-01-31T15:59:04  <cherylhjli> also out of curiosity, are there any analytics wordpress already captures?
2019-01-31T16:00:37  <michelled> cherylhjli: I believe there are wordpress plugins for that as well
2019-01-31T16:01:17  <cherylhjli> I'd be curious to poke around those. I know metrics is something important to capture for the report, wondering if our website can help with that thru the analytics.
2019-01-31T16:01:25  <cherylhjli> michelled^
2019-01-31T16:02:24  <michelled> sounds like a good idea cherylhjli
