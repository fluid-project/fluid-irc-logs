2020-07-20T16:30:22  <gmoss> Justin_o danayo: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-07-20T16:30:30  <Justin_o> gmoss: I am
2020-07-20T16:31:06  <danayo> yes
2020-07-20T16:31:19  <gmoss> great :) I'm in standup, when you're ready
2020-07-20T17:05:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: shall we say 1:30 for pairing? I have to eat a little breakfast so I'm not quite ready at the moment :)
2020-07-20T17:05:18  <Justin_o> gmoss: sounds good
2020-07-20T17:05:25  <Justin_o> ping me when you're ready
2020-07-20T17:13:01  <Justin_o> danayo: this is all I could find for notes from the design crits https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+Options+for+Orator+%28text-to-speech%29+widget
2020-07-20T17:34:27  <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2020-07-20T17:44:05  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm ready to pair up whenever you are
2020-07-20T17:46:20  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, I'm ready now.. should we go back to the standup room?
2020-07-20T17:47:02  <gmoss> Justin_o: assuming it's available, it seems like the best choice :)
2020-07-20T17:47:57  <Justin_o> I'm there now.. seems empty
2020-07-20T17:48:07  <Justin_o> gmoss: ^
