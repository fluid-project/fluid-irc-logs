2020-04-16T17:24:34  <colinclark> i can’t make it today, unfortunately
2020-04-16T17:25:21  <greatislander> oaky colinclark
2020-04-16T17:25:23  <greatislander> *okay
2020-04-16T17:27:42  <jhung> greatislander I don't have anything to report and would prefer to use the time doing reviews of those PRs before the feedback session.
2020-04-16T17:28:10  <danielcho> michelled: yeah, 3 works for me too
2020-04-16T17:28:22  <greatislander> makes sense jhung
2020-04-16T17:37:25  <michelled> greatislander: can you link me the agenda?
2020-04-16T17:39:55  <gmoss> danayo: .mov and .mp4 seem to work fine for me: https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/storyView.html?id=1d4fa000-8009-11ea-becb-f17212d391e9
2020-04-16T17:40:53  <danayo> ok gmoss
2020-04-16T17:40:58  <danayo> nice videos :)
2020-04-16T17:41:13  <gmoss> thanks :)
2020-04-16T17:41:27  <danayo> can we add “mp4s are generally supported” to the doc, do you think?
2020-04-16T17:41:27  <greatislander> michelled https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N7tyaB6-k35i6m6TkQ_yT1MPSoP7hlNxDGA9eP4TLmI
2020-04-16T17:41:28  <gmoss> the mp4 one is actually already part of the browser test suite, has been for over a year
2020-04-16T17:41:37  <gmoss> danayo: yes I think that would be safe
2020-04-16T17:41:39  <danayo> ok
2020-04-16T17:41:51  <gmoss> it's just that they may not show up in the list of files on iOS
2020-04-16T17:42:01  <gmoss> as described in SJRK-222
2020-04-16T17:42:07  <danayo> right
2020-04-16T17:42:36  <danayo> gmoss: “MP4s are generally supported (though they may not show up when browsing for video files)”
2020-04-16T17:42:50  <gmoss> danayo: that works for me :)
2020-04-16T17:42:58  <danayo> 8)
2020-04-16T17:45:27  <gmoss> danayo: is it okay if we keep the admin username the same but change only the password? changing the username requires code changes
2020-04-16T17:45:55  <cherylhjli> I can never seem to find the PCC agenda - can someone send it along? jhung greatislander danayo michelled
2020-04-16T17:46:04  <danayo> gmoss: I can’t think of a reason why not

2020-04-16T18:22:46  <greatislander> cool!
2020-04-16T18:22:55  <michelled> he says as soon as it's ready it will have world wide usage
2020-04-16T18:24:29  <colinclark> woah
2020-04-16T18:24:32  <colinclark> how nice!
2020-04-16T18:24:58  <michelled> he also mentioned that he'd love to be more involved in the co-design of it
2020-04-16T18:25:00  <cherylhjli> woah that's cool
2020-04-16T18:25:05  <cherylhjli> mondragon, or trebor?

2020-04-16T18:25:44  <cherylhjli> we can give him a walkthrough of the wires next meeting
2020-04-16T18:25:50  <michelled> perhaps something to put on an agenda in the next couple weeks?
2020-04-16T18:25:55  <cherylhjli> jinx! yep
2020-04-16T18:26:00  <michelled> :)

2020-04-16T18:26:13  <cherylhjli> maybe we can talk to them to get their feedback
2020-04-16T18:26:52  <michelled> I think they expect it to be useful to the individual coops
2020-04-16T18:31:35  <greatislander> cherylhjli, jhung do you have a few minutes before your next session to talk about global nav?
2020-04-16T18:31:49  <greatislander> I think it would be easier to discuss in a conversation rather than via GitHub comments

2020-04-16T19:06:18  <danayo> cherylhjli, greatislander, jhung I just came across this http://digicoop.io/en/
2020-04-16T19:07:39  <danayo> looks like they just have one product - Kantree - a collaborative management platform
2020-04-16T19:08:04  <cherylhjli> yeah I was looking at Kantree as well - that looks really interesting
2020-04-16T19:08:11  <danayo> cool cherylhjli
2020-04-16T19:08:22  <cherylhjli> looks like trello and github had a mash up haha
2020-04-16T19:08:37  <danayo> I was trying to figure out what a “Startup Co-op” was cherylhjli, and they came up
2020-04-16T19:08:45  <cherylhjli> btw danayo greatislander - our feedback sesh got cancelled so the coop room is free for the rest of the day
2020-04-16T19:08:51  <cherylhjli> startup coop - is that a co-op just in their early stages?

2020-04-16T19:10:43  <danayo> cherylhjli:  http://www.startup-coop.fr/
