2019-08-19T20:09:11  <lliskovoi_> @cherylhjli @danayo_ so I didn't find any language selector specific roles that could be identified by assistive technologies. But, I realized that while it's likely not possible to identify the language the AT is using, it is possible to detect the language used by the browser. So perhaps that can be used to control the initial settings.
2019-08-19T20:09:28  <lliskovoi_> Also I came across an article that used the format "English, select your language" which I thought was useful since it contains both 'English' and 'language', two words users could be keeping an ear out for.
2019-08-19T20:17:05  <danayo_> thanks lliskovoi_ ! That makes a lot of sense to me (“English, select your language”). We are planning to incorporate detection of browser language for sure.
