2020-09-03T17:00:27  <danayo> gmoss, michelled, Justin_o I am so sorry I got completely caught up in what I was doing!
2020-09-03T17:01:12  <Justin_o> danayo: no problem. were there things you wanted to discuss today?
2020-09-03T17:02:55  <danayo> Justin_o, gmoss I don’t have anything pressing, I know we were going to keep talking about autosave and draft load etc, but I can do some work on my own on some design ideas based on our previous discussion and we can talk on Monday. But if you want to meet now or later today I’m available
2020-09-03T17:03:11  <michelled> tuesday :)
2020-09-03T17:03:14  <michelled> long weekend
2020-09-03T17:03:19  <danayo> Tuesday, yes! :)
2020-09-03T17:03:41  <Justin_o> danayo: one other thing came up about preventing publishing and preview while a file is uploading.
2020-09-03T17:03:49  <Justin_o> there is a possibility that an error occurs with the upload.
2020-09-03T17:03:54  <gmoss> danayo Justin_o: I'm good to discuss now or on Tuesday :)
2020-09-03T17:03:57  <gmoss> or later today
2020-09-03T17:04:14  <Justin_o> I can talk for the next 30 min today, but will be offline after and not sure when I'll be back
2020-09-03T17:07:51  <danayo> Justin_o, gmoss if you need my input I’m happy to meet now
2020-09-03T17:08:18  <gmoss> danayo: I think it would be helpful, since it pertains to what I'm working on now

2020-09-03T18:45:38  <Teddy___> Thanks Cindy! this helps alot
2020-09-03T18:48:24  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2020-09-03T18:51:00  <cindyli> hi gmoss, i read the notes for the storytelling check in today. is that enough for a catch up?
2020-09-03T18:52:38  <gmoss> cindyli: I haven't yet double-checked it for accuracy, but I believe the notes capture everything we talked about today :)
2020-09-03T18:52:59  <gmoss> including the part where gtirloni popped in to answer some questions about server storage
2020-09-03T18:53:29  <cindyli> that's great. thanks, gmoss
2020-09-03T19:10:44  <greatislander> hey michelled, I expect not but let me know if there's anything you'd like to touch base about before our call with Trebor and Aman
2020-09-03T19:11:01  <greatislander> gmoss want to talk about BackstopJS at some point? I've got a pretty open schedule tomorrow
2020-09-03T19:12:23  <gmoss> greatislander: sure, I have time tomorrow as well. Say 1:30 PM EDT/2:30 ADT?
2020-09-03T19:12:40  <greatislander> that would be great, want to send a calendar invite?
2020-09-03T19:13:26  <gmoss> I'd briefly looked at it a couple years ago when contemplating some visual regression testing for the Storytelling Tool, but I don't remember what I determined at the time. I'm looking forward to seeing what you've come up with :)
2020-09-03T19:13:26  <gmoss> greatislander: sure
2020-09-03T19:13:36  <greatislander> perfect!
2020-09-03T19:16:01  <gmoss> Others are, of course, welcome to join us :)
2020-09-03T19:24:33  <greatislander> +1!
2020-09-03T19:24:42  * greatislander runs quick errand
2020-09-03T20:16:58  <gtirloni> I've changed all the infrastructure-related repos to use the `main` branch. It was relatively effortless (git branch -m master main; git push; change default branch in the UI; git push origin --delete master).
2020-09-03T20:49:19  <cindyli> gmoss, greatislander: i'm interested in the BackstopJS meeting too. i have another meeting at 1. if it ends early enough, I will join your guys. which zoom room will you have the BackstopJS meeting?
2020-09-03T20:59:02  <greatislander> cindyli gmoss I expect we will use the IDRC General room if it's available!
2020-09-03T20:59:22  <greatislander> We could also push it back a little bit perhaps, I'll wait to see what gmoss says in the morning :)
2020-09-03T20:59:22  <michelled> hey philip are you in the middle of things?
2020-09-03T20:59:22  <cindyli> cool. thanks, greatislander
2020-09-03T20:59:53  <philip> Hey michelled, I'm fighting with Infusion at the moment. What's up?
2020-09-03T21:00:04  <michelled> do you have a few minutes to check in?
2020-09-03T21:00:17  <michelled> wecount room perhaps?
2020-09-03T21:02:28  <philip> Sure thing, give me a minute
2020-09-03T21:05:21  <michelled> yup, for sure
2020-09-03T21:07:52  <gmoss> greatislander: (and cindyli when you're back online) we can definitely reschedule it to later in the afternoon! And yes the plan was to use the IDRC General meeting room :)
2020-09-03T21:14:49  <greatislander> okay great, let's move it back to start as soon as cindyli is free.
