2019-08-30T13:58:48  <danielcho> alanharnum: I am trying to connect to wifi with this arduino board, and it requires SSID and password; though connection at the office is 802.1X, which requires additional authentication process of entering username and password, I was wondering if there's a password I can use to by pass the authentication?
2019-08-30T14:00:23  <alanharnum> danielcho: you should be able to use your OCAD credentials to connect to the OCAD wifi (not OCAD Guest) - there are instructions on the IT helpdesk site. I'd dig them up but about to start an interview with michelled - check in with me later if you can't get it working?
2019-08-30T14:01:16  <danielcho> alanharnum: oh got it, I will check the IT helpdesk and check in with you later if I can't figure it out, thanks!

2019-08-30T17:30:18  <michelled> gmoss: has lisa ever taking a look at the storytelling tool with her a11y expert opinion?
2019-08-30T17:32:34  <gmoss> michelled: not yet, as far as I know! I wasn't sure how charging that would be handled haha.. and she's normally quite busy. I can ask her to take a look, of course
2019-08-30T17:32:43  <gmoss> it seems valuable
2019-08-30T17:33:04  <gmoss> i.e. getting her expert opinion seems worthwhile
2019-08-30T17:34:23  <michelled> yeah, I think it's worth doing before we have screen reader users trying it out in a couple weeks!
2019-08-30T17:35:00  <michelled> lisa has c2lc in her time assist and any core work on storytelling is considered that
2019-08-30T17:35:48  <gmoss> michelled: okay, I'll put a little email together. Shall I copy you?
2019-08-30T17:36:01  <michelled> yeah, sounds great! thx
2019-08-30T17:36:17  <gmoss> no problem at all :) it's a great idea
2019-08-30T17:37:53  <michelled> it wasn't mine :) I finally got to check in with colin while they drove from the conference to their next location ;)
