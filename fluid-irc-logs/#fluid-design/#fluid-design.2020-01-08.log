2020-01-08T14:42:46  <sepidehshahi> I can try moving the items added to the list to Jira michelled if that’s helpful
2020-01-08T14:43:11  <avtar> michelled: sounds good
2020-01-08T14:43:19  <michelled> it's ok - I'll do it - but in the future it'll be less work if we just do this once
2020-01-08T14:43:35  <avtar> i added a task yesterday

2020-01-08T15:44:34  <michelled> since all I'm doing now is copy and pasting in to JIRAS

2020-01-08T19:06:34  <michelled> avtar, colinclark, danielcho, simonjb: would you be ok with doing the C2LC milestone 3 planning before our next iteration planning? so Jan 21 at 10:00 am eastern for milestone planning and then iteration planning after that?
2020-01-08T19:06:46  <michelled> that might mean picking up the iteration planning again at 12:30 eastern
2020-01-08T19:07:49  <colinclark> I have a standing meeting with Gregg and Sandra then
2020-01-08T19:07:55  <colinclark> but I could reschedule it
2020-01-08T19:09:52  <michelled> is there another time that day that works better, colinclark? maybe 3:30 eastern?
2020-01-08T19:10:07  <colinclark> any time after 12 pm is good
2020-01-08T19:10:24  <colinclark> but as I say, it’s not a meeting I’d feel disappointed to cancel
2020-01-08T19:10:33  <michelled> :)
2020-01-08T19:11:32  <danielcho> michelled: yep, I am okay with that or anytime after 12 :)
