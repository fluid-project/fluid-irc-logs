2019-10-02T18:50:03  <greatislander> Fine with me cherylhjli
2019-10-02T19:09:16  <jhung> cherylhjli works for me. That probably means we should checkin earlier to go over the agenda
2019-10-02T19:22:51  <cherylhjli> ah sorry colinclark I see that we sent conflicting emails to michael at the same time
2019-10-02T19:23:06  <cherylhjli> would you like to join tomorrow's meeting?
2019-10-02T19:23:11  <cherylhjli> if so we can find another time
2019-10-02T19:23:33  <colinclark> it doesn’t matter to me
2019-10-02T19:23:41  <colinclark> let’s see how the time works for everyone else
2019-10-02T19:24:24  <colinclark> simonjb or danielcho: Can one of your prep a Photon kit for Bridges for me? I’m going to drop it by their office on Friday afternoon.
2019-10-02T19:24:44  <danielcho> colinclark: sure, I can do that
2019-10-02T19:24:56  <colinclark> thanks so much
2019-10-02T19:25:09  <danielcho> no problem!

2019-10-02T19:55:05  <michelled> colinclark, danielcho, simonjb: I want to restart our daily checkin for C2LC
2019-10-02T19:55:32  <michelled> it looks like 1:00 might be good according to the calendar - except for wednesday when we have the all team check in with Bridges
2019-10-02T19:55:36  <michelled> what do you think?
2019-10-02T19:55:55  <colinclark> i never want to have another meeting ever again
2019-10-02T19:56:04  <danielcho> hahaha
2019-10-02T19:56:13  <colinclark> unless it’s with the four of you
2019-10-02T19:56:16  <colinclark> then i’m in
2019-10-02T19:56:27  <colinclark> or, if i’m honest, anyone
2019-10-02T19:56:46  <simonjb> michelled: 1pm is good for me
2019-10-02T19:56:48  <danielcho> michelled: I am fine with it if others are okay
2019-10-02T19:57:17  <simonjb> but only if colinclark joins it everyday!
2019-10-02T19:57:19  <colinclark> in general 1 pm is ok for me; i’ll miss occasionally ut i’m sure that’s ok
2019-10-02T19:57:28  <colinclark> simonjb: twice a day maybe?
2019-10-02T19:57:44  <colinclark> let’s meet every hour
2019-10-02T19:57:48  <simonjb> even better!
2019-10-02T19:57:49  <colinclark> super agile
2019-10-02T19:57:56  <michelled> ha!
2019-10-02T19:58:05  <colinclark> I really feel like meetings are what we do well
2019-10-02T19:58:09  <colinclark> so let’s do more of that
2019-10-02T19:58:20  <colinclark> i’m kidding of course
2019-10-02T19:59:06  <danielcho> oh I was going to tag Avtar too but he is not on this channel
2019-10-02T19:59:17  <michelled> yeah, that's why I didn' tmessage him yet
2019-10-02T19:59:21  <colinclark> More seriously, I feel like meetings where we sit and draw are pretty much peak meeting awesomeness
