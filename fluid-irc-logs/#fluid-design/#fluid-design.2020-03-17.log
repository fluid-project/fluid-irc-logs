Could you update this table with your work when you have a chance? Thanks.

2020-03-17T15:29:16  <Justin_o> surprisingly the floeproject.org didn't do so well... maybe something that we can fix up with the site migration
2020-03-17T15:30:20  <gmoss> awesome greatislander!

2020-03-17T15:35:13  <Justin_o> well done!
2020-03-17T15:45:18  <Teddy___> how does visiting a website produce carbon?
2020-03-17T15:45:29  <greatislander> Websites running on servers
2020-03-17T15:45:40  <Teddy___> ahh right
2020-03-17T15:45:49  <greatislander> Loading data takes energy so the less data your website transmits, the better!
2020-03-17T15:45:56  <gmoss> so dirty energy = more carbon, bigger payload = more carbon, etc
2020-03-17T15:54:45  <gmoss> relevant links: https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/  and  https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/
2020-03-17T15:57:36  <Teddy___> cool thanks guys
2020-03-17T15:59:02  <greatislander> another great post about this recently https://dannyvankooten.com/website-carbon-emissions/
2020-03-17T16:26:43  <cherylhjli> michelled i might be a few min behind on joining the planning!
2020-03-17T16:27:57  <cindyli> Teddy___, greatislander, i thought about how to fetch and store posts and static pages data for sharing across components. please correct me if it doesn't make sense. we can use Store Getters instead of Actions. Getters will fetch all required data at the first time. this static set of data will be exposed via $store.state. This will fix the performance issue with using Actions where the data will be fetched over and over at every
2020-03-17T16:27:57  <cindyli> action call. what do you think about this approach?
2020-03-17T16:29:02  <greatislander> Hi cindyli, that makes good sense to me!
2020-03-17T16:29:58  <Teddy___> yeah sounds like that would work
2020-03-17T16:32:39  <colinclark> hey Justin_o, do you have any good pointers to the work you did to come up with a privacy policy for our Chrome Extension?
2020-03-17T16:32:59  <colinclark> erictheise is looking into a privacy policy for the platform co-op directory, which is required in order to connect with third-party authentication like Google
2020-03-17T16:33:09  <colinclark> and I thought maybe your policy (and the research you did) might be helpful
2020-03-17T16:33:19  <colinclark> indeed, perhaps we can even reuse the UIO+ policy as a template for this?
2020-03-17T16:37:57  <erictheise> iteration planners, my connection is very poor today, trying to join but not having much luck cherylhjli danayo greatislander jhung michelled
2020-03-17T16:41:07  <gmoss> erictheise: I think the time difference has affected things again :) it was an hour ago
2020-03-17T16:41:45  <gmoss> *unless you're talking about a different iteration plan meeting
2020-03-17T16:42:01  <colinclark> gmoss: He is indeed
2020-03-17T16:42:14  <colinclark> An interation planning meeting for the platform co-op development kit
2020-03-17T16:42:23  <gmoss> gotcha :) disregard everything I said, then
2020-03-17T16:47:21  <Justin_o> colinclark, erictheise: here is the JIRA I filed for the privacy policy. https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4043
2020-03-17T16:48:15  <Justin_o> colinclark, erictheise: this is the privacy policy we use for UIO+ https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md
2020-03-17T16:48:31  <colinclark> Thanks, Justin_o
2020-03-17T16:48:56  <erictheise> yes, thanks Justin_o, will check it out after my meeting.
2020-03-17T16:50:19  <Justin_o> The privacy policy for UIO+ is more or less structured to answer the questions from the Privacy Policy Guidlines for extensions. And is structured similar to the Mozilla one.
2020-03-17T17:12:41  <cherylhjli> greatislander danayo do you two have some time today to look at some tool library wires?
