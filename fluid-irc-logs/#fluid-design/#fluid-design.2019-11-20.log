2019-11-20T16:50:26  <simonjb> michelled: I used jira subtasks this time, as an alternative to subtasks in the spreadsheet, to try out moving more tracking work to jira
2019-11-20T16:51:03  <simonjb> michelled: it might work better with your jira features modeling
2019-11-20T16:51:19  <michelled> maybe! let's see
2019-11-20T16:51:30  <michelled> hopefully I can have something to show you today

2019-11-20T19:09:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: it's a little tricky since I'm connected through the collab room and would have to open a window over the presentation in order to grab the links
2019-11-20T19:09:50  <Justin_o> ah jhung do you have a good reference to drop in ^
2019-11-20T19:10:01  <Justin_o> not sure what the web savvy site is

2019-11-20T20:09:19  <Justin_o> gmoss: it's probably worth getting in touch, just to see what it would be and how the tool might work for us
2019-11-20T20:09:51  <gmoss> Justin_o: I agree! who would be the best person to take that on? I don't mind, just might need some guidance
2019-11-20T20:10:26  <Justin_o> I usually ask avtar because he's been quite successful at contacting various places for us

2019-11-20T20:42:42  <gmoss> an audio-only file was also generated, so we could share that instead
