2020-03-13T16:27:49  <greatislander> I'm just deploying the latest version to pinecone.platform.coop so you don't have to worry about it.
2020-03-13T16:27:55  <greatislander> Give it about five minutes.

2020-03-13T19:29:33  <Teddy___> `pages/index.vue` specifically generates the home page but `pages/_slug.vue/index.vue` should be able to generate all pages including the home page

2020-03-13T19:46:08  <greatislander> @Teddy___ @cindyli I've added some comments to the button/link styles. Maybe helpful to look at together on Monday if we have time after our other items :)
2020-03-13T19:46:26  <cindyli> sure
2020-03-13T19:46:27  <Teddy___> Okay :)
2020-03-13T19:47:25  <greatislander> Teddy___ most of the comments are about relative units in CSS, this is a helpful article: https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/relative-sizing-with-em-units/
2020-03-13T19:47:44  <greatislander> And this too :) https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/px-to-em-functions/
2020-03-13T19:48:27  <Teddy___> thanks, I'll check it out
2020-03-13T19:54:41  <cindyli> Teddy___, greatislander, i found when accessing the root of the site "http://localhost:3000/", `pages/_slug/index.vue` is never reached because there isn't a `_slug`. one approach to make our home page "http://localhost:3000/home/" by adding a path "/home". do you think if this approach is acceptable?

2020-03-13T19:55:57  <cindyli> or we'd prefer to have users visit "https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/" as the home page rather than "https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/home"?

2020-03-13T19:56:45  <Teddy___> "https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/home" is not the most aesthetic url
2020-03-13T19:56:57  <cindyli> ok. make sense
2020-03-13T19:57:04  <Teddy___> I think there is a way to achieve "https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/"
2020-03-13T19:57:14  <Teddy___> I currently testing it out right now
2020-03-13T19:57:24  <cindyli> thanks
2020-03-13T20:00:49  <greatislander> cindyli Teddy___ one other thing I just thought of— the home page will have a different layout (see Figma file) so having it share the same vue file as the other pages probably isn't what we want anyway.
2020-03-13T20:01:16  <Teddy___> okay never mind than
2020-03-13T20:01:28  <Teddy___> thank you for pointing that out Ned!
2020-03-13T20:01:32  <greatislander> No prob!
2020-03-13T20:01:38  <greatislander> We should keep `pages/index.vue`
2020-03-13T20:01:50  <greatislander> We will need to make some changes to it soon, but we can leave it for now
2020-03-13T20:02:58  <cindyli> i see. thanks guys
2020-03-13T20:12:27  <cindyli> Teddy___, greatislander: regarding splitting /news-and-views into /news and /views pages, I'm thinking about sharing the same template for these 2 pages as they are identical except the content. but now we already have one shared template using `pages/_slug/index.vue` for all other pages except /news-and-views. I don't think it's a good idea to present 2 very different templates in it. so, a work around I think of is to use `pages/
2020-03-13T20:12:27  <cindyli> news-and-views/_category/index.vue` to hold the template shared by news and views. but this will turn the urls for these pages to "/news-and-views/news" and "/news-and-views/views". do you think if this is acceptable? or are there better solutions?
2020-03-13T20:14:25  <greatislander> cindyli I would need to check the documentation but I think it should be possible to have a template for a specific route which overrides the `_slug` template. So any page would be displayed using `_slug/index.vue, but if you provide a template for a specific route that would be used instead.
2020-03-13T20:17:29  <cindyli> greatislander: yes, but now we have 2 routes: /news and /views and i don't want to copy the same template into each. the goal is to share the same template for this 2 routes
2020-03-13T20:17:40  <greatislander> Oh I see.
2020-03-13T20:18:19  <Teddy___> cindlyli the solution you suggested should work
2020-03-13T20:18:19  <greatislander> I think they might need to be a little bit different so maybe that's okay to have two different templates? The archive page for News has a different preview for news items (external links) than the views page
2020-03-13T20:18:40  <Teddy___> "/news-and-views/_news"
2020-03-13T20:18:51  <Teddy___> "/news-and-views/_views"
2020-03-13T20:19:31  <cindyli> ok, checking the wireframe first
2020-03-13T20:24:17  <cindyli> Teddy___, greatislander: yes, the designs for news and views are slightly different. views page has "search", "filter" and thumbnail preview pictures for fetched items. i will use different templates then. thanks
2020-03-13T20:24:25  <greatislander> sounds good!
2020-03-13T20:25:32  <Teddy___> perfect
