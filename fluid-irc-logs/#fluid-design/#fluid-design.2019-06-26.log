2019-06-26T15:38:47  <jhung> michelled back when I was looking into Cupper for the CMHR work, I decided not to use Cupper because of the bizarre way the theme structured the templates. I found some things contrary to what the accepted best practices were (are) for Hugo themes.
2019-06-26T15:39:10  <cherylhjli> danayo michelled: quick PC check in?

2019-06-26T15:50:15  <cherylhjli> Probably not so much on what we're doing, but I did have a quick question that's been rattling around in my head re: learning commons
2019-06-26T15:50:58  <cherylhjli> danayo^
2019-06-26T15:53:07  <cherylhjli> its not time sensitive, so if you prefer heads down time on sketching today we can check in another day
2019-06-26T15:56:27  <danayo> cherylhjli: why don't we meet quickly now then
2019-06-26T16:03:30  <colinclark> cherylhjli, danayo: What do you think the most visually-compelling instantiation of our work on platform cooperatives is so far?

2019-06-26T16:29:28  <michelled> jhung: thx for the info about Cupper
2019-06-26T16:29:42  <michelled> I might switch themes, but I think it would be good for me to learn a bit more about hugo first

2019-06-26T18:23:04  <michelled> jhung: we are going to build our own theme after we've had a chance to work on the design more so for now I've found an interim solution using the cupper theme
