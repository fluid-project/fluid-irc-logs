2019-03-18T14:11:50  <michelled> gmoss, cindyli, sepidehshahi: can we turn editing off on the site now?
2019-03-18T14:11:51  *** alanharnum <alanharnum!~alanharnu@2607:fea8:12a0:b9b:8c43:3a4c:eb7f:803c> has joined #fluid-design
2019-03-18T14:12:12  <sepidehshahi> good story michelled
2019-03-18T14:12:26  <sepidehshahi> Sure, I thought it has been turned off on the 15th
2019-03-18T14:12:39  <michelled> no, not yet
2019-03-18T14:14:25  <michelled> sepidehshahi: I think there are two options for turning it off today - in terms of what the UI is like. 1. we can have the landing page redirect to the browse page and remove the 'build your story' button from it. 2. we can remove the editor from the landing page and slightly rework the text so it doesn't invite people to create a story
2019-03-18T14:14:34  <michelled> sepidehshahi: which do you think is better?
2019-03-18T14:14:44  <sepidehshahi> I’m ok with turning that off. Even for the deaf culture we had given them a deadline of March 15th for uploading their stories
2019-03-18T14:15:07  <michelled> this is only the interim solution of course - we'll change to having the next framing that you and caren are working on
2019-03-18T14:15:15  <michelled> when it's ready
2019-03-18T14:16:10  <sepidehshahi> I think I prefer the second option. Taking them directly to the browse stories might be confusing and also not consistent with what we want to do later on
2019-03-18T14:16:38  <sepidehshahi> So if you can change the text a little bit and hide the editor would be great and later we will give you the content for the landing page
2019-03-18T14:16:50  <michelled> perfect
2019-03-18T14:16:59  <michelled> gmoss: does that work for you?
2019-03-18T14:24:32  <gmoss> michelled: that sounds workable! Omw in, we can discuss once I've arrived :)
2019-03-18T14:26:01  <cindyli> michelled, gmoss, sepidehshahi, we should prevent the case when someone accesses the edit story page by accessing its url directly, such as https://stories.floeproject.org/storyEdit.html. A redirection to the landing page might be helpful in this case
2019-03-18T14:26:25  <michelled> good idea cindyli
2019-03-18T14:26:43  <gmoss> cindyli: indeed, we'll also want to turn off the http endpoint for posting a story form
2019-03-18T14:26:54  <michelled> yes, that's the most important gmoss :)
2019-03-18T14:26:58  <cindyli> good idea
2019-03-18T14:27:00  <gmoss> Much like alanharnum did with the karisma site
2019-03-18T14:27:15  <gmoss> *much like = exactly like :)
2019-03-18T14:27:35  <michelled> gmoss: maybe when you get in you can make a jira that captures all this?

2019-03-18T14:28:06  <gmoss> I can start whipping one up right now and post when I have reception
2019-03-18T14:28:17  <michelled> :)
2019-03-18T14:31:41  <michelled> sepidehshahi: can we tentatively say 3:00 to talk about BiT and we can see if it works for Dana when she comes online?
2019-03-18T14:31:55  <sepidehshahi> sounds good to me michelled
2019-03-18T14:32:01  <michelled> thx!
