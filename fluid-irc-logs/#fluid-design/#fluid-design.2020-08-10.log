2020-08-10T12:05:23  <greatislander> Hi gtirloni, no rush as I know it'
2020-08-10T12:05:56  <greatislander> *it's early for you. I was looking at https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/issues/43 and I can't find the corresponding Mapbox key in 1Password. Can you confirm it's in the Platform Co-op vault?
2020-08-10T13:15:43  <gtirloni> greatislander: Hi, I think we're using our own key for the fluidproject so it's in the "Fluid" vault. Do you have access for it?
2020-08-10T13:16:23  <greatislander> gtirloni I don't have access to that one.
2020-08-10T13:17:17  <gtirloni> I moved it to the platform co-op vault
2020-08-10T13:17:46  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-08-10T13:26:09  <gtirloni> yw :)
2020-08-10T15:09:55  <jhung> greatislander and cherylhjli - did the breakout room work out okay for you.
2020-08-10T15:13:00  <cherylhjli> jhung - the breakout room worked great!
2020-08-10T15:13:22  <jhung> ok cool. Just checking. :)
2020-08-10T15:21:19  <greatislander> yep!
2020-08-10T15:39:53  <jhung> cherylhjli I moved the Coop retro and crit on the Fluid calendar. Hope that's okay. Also which room should we use for the Coop retro?
2020-08-10T15:41:42  <cherylhjli> jhung - thanks for moving them :)
2020-08-10T15:41:43  <cherylhjli> hmm
2020-08-10T15:41:51  <cherylhjli> maybe the general idrc room?
2020-08-10T15:49:42  <jhung> cherylhjli ok sounds good. I'll add it to the calendar.
2020-08-10T15:49:50  <cherylhjli> thanks jhung!
2020-08-10T15:50:53  <greatislander> okay one last design question for cherylhjli and danayo: are there designs for the map popup cards somewhere?
2020-08-10T15:51:21  <cherylhjli> yes.. let me dig it up
2020-08-10T15:51:49  <greatislander> found it I think
2020-08-10T15:52:01  <greatislander> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/qpKpqLiR/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-10%20at%2012.51.52%20PM.png
2020-08-10T15:52:03  <greatislander> This?
2020-08-10T15:59:25  <cherylhjli> greatislander - yep!
2020-08-10T15:59:30  <greatislander> thanks
2020-08-10T15:59:32  <cherylhjli> I just updated the design to be with the accurate map
2020-08-10T15:59:35  <cherylhjli> but the card itself is accurate
2020-08-10T16:00:03  <greatislander> okay thanks
2020-08-10T16:00:05  <danayo> thanks cherylhjli and greatislander!
2020-08-10T16:02:19  <greatislander> okay I have ONE more question
2020-08-10T16:02:20  <greatislander> lol
2020-08-10T16:03:37  <greatislander> it appears from my cursory exploration of the Mapbox APIs that I can't create clusters of both individuals and organizations since they come from different sources. I have to create clusters of each. It seems like it would be a good idea to have clusters of people appear differently from clusters of organizations, so I'm wondering if you think we should use a different colour scheme cherylhjli?
2020-08-10T16:03:40  <greatislander> danayo ^
2020-08-10T16:04:52  <greatislander> nevermind, figured out how to cluster them together I think cherylhjli danayo :)
2020-08-10T16:09:06  <cherylhjli> ok greatislander!
2020-08-10T16:10:26  <danayo> :)
2020-08-10T16:30:56  <gmoss> cindyli1 danayo michelled: are you available for Storytelling Tool check-in?

2020-08-10T16:31:57  <michelled> Teddy___, colinclark: we haven't checked in for a while - does tomorrow at 3:00 eastern work?

2020-08-10T16:56:19  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo I take it back. I can't cluster both together. so if you can provide a colour scheme for individual clusters that would be great :)
2020-08-10T16:57:29  <cherylhjli> sure greatislander!
2020-08-10T16:57:47  <cherylhjli> I will look at it a bit later this afternoon
2020-08-10T16:59:39  <danayo> ok greatislander

2020-08-10T18:09:28  <gmoss> cindyli danayo michelled: I just found this article on MDN about "better" ways of doing browser and feature detection. I think this will be useful for SJRK-307 so I'll leave a link to it on the Jira, and I thought you might all be interested in checking it out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent
