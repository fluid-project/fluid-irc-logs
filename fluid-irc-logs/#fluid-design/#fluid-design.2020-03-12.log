2020-03-12T18:10:03  <philip> gmoss: Do I understands correctly that the board doesn't come with any sensors?
2020-03-12T18:10:29  <gmoss> philip: iirc it comes with a handful on board, but there's the option to plug more in
2020-03-12T18:11:21  <gmoss> it also has to be physically connected to your device to use it, unlike the TI Sensortag
2020-03-12T18:11:42  <philip> I see
2020-03-12T18:11:46  <gmoss> from PSLab site: "PSLab comes with a built-in Oscilloscope, Multimeter, Wave Generator, Logic Analyzer, Power Source, and many more instruments"
2020-03-12T18:12:13  <gmoss> The main advantage is that it's FOSS and open hardware
2020-03-12T18:13:22  <philip> Yeah, I wouldn't know how to do anything with those components. I know next to nothing about electronics, to the continued disappointment of my father
2020-03-12T18:42:38  <michelled> simonjb, danielcho: are you available now ?

2020-03-12T18:53:35  <greatislander> just figured I
2020-03-12T18:53:41  <greatislander> *I'd check :)
2020-03-12T18:53:41  <erictheise> no pressing need for me although greatislander I'm curious about timeline for npm release and jhung curious about timeline for signup flow feedback.
2020-03-12T18:53:53  <greatislander> @erictheise I'm working on that right now!
2020-03-12T18:54:01  <erictheise> excellent, thanks.
2020-03-12T18:54:47  <jhung> erictheise it's on my todo. Please don't wait for me. Hopefully any feedback I give can be addressed later.
