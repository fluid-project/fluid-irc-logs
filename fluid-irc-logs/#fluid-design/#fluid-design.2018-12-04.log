2018-12-04T19:01:09  <carenwatkins_> hi everyone: I've recently used https://www.mindmup.com/  for mapping. Wondering if you have any experience with a good, free online mind mapping app or site.
2018-12-04T19:01:55  <lliskovoi> carenwatkins_: I think Julia was using a tool that she really liked, might be worth sending her an email

2018-12-04T20:20:26  <danayo> carenwatkins_: mindmup seems pretty great - is there a reason you want something different? is it about accessibility?
2018-12-04T20:42:23  <danayo> sepidehshahi, simonjb, colinclark (and everyone else who worked on it): I’ve been looking through the cities co-design toolkit and it’s really great! There’s an amazing amount of content there so I’ve just scratched the surface, but I’m especially finding the reflections super interesting and helpful. Nice work :)
2018-12-04T20:43:39  <sepidehshahi> Thanks danayo, I’m really glad you find it useful :)

2018-12-04T22:13:27  <colinclark> danayo: Possibly the most succinct definition of a platform cooperative that I've seen is in this document: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8y4bvs0w7RdUGp3RS1hQ1hfenFaTDlUTVNfVGdxVEdmdmQ0/view
2018-12-04T22:17:14  <colinclark> A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a cooperatively owned, democratically governed business that establishes a computing platform, and uses a protocol, website or mobile app to facilitate the sale of goods and services. Platform cooperatives are an alternative to traditional venture capital funded platforms insofar as they are owned and governed by those who depend on them most—workers, users, and other relevant
2018-12-04T22:17:14  <colinclark> stakeholders. Platform cooperatives differ from traditional cooperatives not only due to their use of digital technologies, but also by their contribution to the commons for the purpose of fostering an equitable social and economic landscape.
