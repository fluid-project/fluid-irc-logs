2019-12-17T19:43:09  <danayo> jhung, greatislander, michelled: I added a Map/Index section to the main project wiki page, for consistency with what we have there now (we have sections there for Learning Commons, Labour Platform, Website). I could create a separate page for the Index if you think thatâ€™s a better approach? In that case we might want to do some wiki gardening at some point to create separate pages for the other tools too
