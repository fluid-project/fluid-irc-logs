2020-03-03T15:24:30  <greatislander> Hi alanharnum, wanted to follow up on my question about the We Count wordpress site. I'm still getting a number of errors (right now an out of memory error).
2020-03-03T15:25:02  <greatislander> Can we connect on this sometime today when it works for you?

2020-03-03T15:47:21  <alanharnum> greatislander: yes, let's try and talk this afternoon - I haven't had a chance to dig into the logs yet myself
2020-03-03T15:47:27  <greatislander> sure thing
2020-03-03T15:47:58  <greatislander> looks like there were some memory issuesâ€” I disabled a few plugins that I'm pretty sure weren't being used and it seems to have stabilized so maybe one of them was the culprit
2020-03-03T15:48:42  <alanharnum> greatislander: it's possible - I will also check if there's a PHP version update, make sure the server isn't running out of resources, etc
2020-03-03T15:48:50  <greatislander> sounds good!

2020-03-03T16:05:36  <gmoss> Not sure what the context for Live being mentioned is, but I think it's great :) lots of professional electronic music artists use it. I haven't touched it since version 5 so it's been a while :O
2020-03-03T16:07:02  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: this looks like quite a good intro video to Ableton Live https://youtu.be/25Zcy8Uu4dw
2020-03-03T16:08:41  <simonjb> gmoss: we're adding multiple characters to the C2LC coding environment with a timeline-like view and I was thinking that Live might be a good existing UI to look at for existing software
2020-03-03T16:09:14  <simonjb> particularly is 'live' editing features

2020-03-03T16:11:53  <gmoss> gmoss: very interesting idea!
2020-03-03T16:12:36  <gmoss> the multitrack model from Live or another DAW makes sense to adapt for controlling multiple robots
2020-03-03T16:12:51  <gmoss> DAWs also often handle automation tasks :)
2020-03-03T16:13:10  <simonjb> (DAW = Digital Audio Workstation)
2020-03-03T16:13:22  <gmoss> sorry, yes, thanks simonjb
2020-03-03T16:17:27  <gmoss> It makes me wonder what other aspects could be reinterpreted from the music production world. MIDI in/out and VST-style plugins are things that could be handled by the Nexus, I suppose!
2020-03-03T16:17:39  <gmoss> very neta

2020-03-03T16:58:50  <danielcho> thanks michelled, brainstorming meeting will be done before that, so I think we are fine :)
2020-03-03T17:00:59  <danayo> jhung, erictheise know we were going to meet now but maybe a quick debrief on the crit with cherylhjli first?
2020-03-03T17:01:06  <danayo> and greatislander ^ ?
