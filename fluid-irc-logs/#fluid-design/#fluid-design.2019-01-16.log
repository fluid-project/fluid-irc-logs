2019-01-16T21:15:41  <carenwatkins_> Hello all. We are adding a storytelling safety and etiquette pop-up on the StoryTelling Project site. Here are a few items we've considered so far--any other suggestions? • Avoid identifying information such as names or locations in your story.
2019-01-16T21:15:41  <carenwatkins_> • Don’t publish photos of other people without explicit consent.
2019-01-16T21:15:41  <carenwatkins_> • Do write about your story and not someone else's.
2019-01-16T21:25:25  <jhung> carenwatkins_: is content / language a concern? Also what happens if stories are found that break any of those guidelines?
2019-01-16T21:25:41  <jhung> *questionable content / language
2019-01-16T21:26:02  <avtar> michelled: please take a look when you have time https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/pull/38
2019-01-16T21:27:51  <carenwatkins_> Jhung: those are really good and important questions. I wonder if we need to have a terms page.
2019-01-16T21:28:39  <carenwatkins_> A terms of agreement page
2019-01-16T21:29:47  <simonjb> hi there carenwatkins_ , would you have any time to chat about the Story Telling design?
2019-01-16T21:30:08  <carenwatkins_> I wonder if we have crafted participation terms for any other projects?
2019-01-16T21:30:21  <jhung> carenwatkins_: it also gets into some very murky waters very quickly as you can imagine. Do we limit self expression? What are those limits? etc. I think some of this could be avoided by setting up a scope for the activity or tool (i.e. "Stories about empowerment and learning" and "not a free-for-all" etc.).
2019-01-16T21:31:37  <michelled> avtar, danayo: I can meet now if you'd like
2019-01-16T21:31:43  <carenwatkins_> Agree, jhung. We've been crafting the intro copy to attempt that scoping
2019-01-16T21:31:52  <carenwatkins_> Hi simonjb yes, sure. Vidyo?
2019-01-16T21:32:21  <simonjb> carenwatkins_: awesome, in 15 mins? 4:45? yeah, Vidyo is good for me
2019-01-16T21:32:50  <carenwatkins_> Yes, simonjb ! My room is open whenever you're ready.

2019-01-16T23:08:51  <avtar> alanharnum: i'll finish adding the netlify documentation on monday, although perhaps on the wiki instead of the ops repo
