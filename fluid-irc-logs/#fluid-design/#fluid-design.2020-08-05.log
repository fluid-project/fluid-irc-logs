2020-08-05T14:10:27  <greatislander> Hi cindyli! I sent you an email about your question from yesterday, let me know if you need anything else :)
2020-08-05T14:12:23  <cindyli> thanks, greatislander. yes i got the email. it looks very helpful. i will try it soon
2020-08-05T14:18:04  <greatislander> great!
2020-08-05T14:35:15  <cindyli> greatislander: i tried with github repo secrets and found the pull request CI triggered from my forked wecount repo cannot access secrets defined in the main wecount repo. the github actions doc mentions it: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow
2020-08-05T14:35:17  <cindyli> "With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository.
2020-08-05T14:35:29  <greatislander> Ah, right.
2020-08-05T14:35:56  <greatislander> That's the standard IDRC practice, right? That everyone works in forks as opposed to branches of the main repository?
2020-08-05T14:36:01  <cindyli> ya
2020-08-05T14:36:09  <cindyli> i think i will remove "npm run build" from github CI.
2020-08-05T14:36:37  <cindyli> the build step will be tested with the netlify deploy preview anyway :)
2020-08-05T14:36:53  <greatislander> true.
2020-08-05T14:38:06  <cindyli> thanks, greatislander. now I learnt github repo secrets. Cheers!
2020-08-05T14:38:13  <greatislander> most welcome! :)
