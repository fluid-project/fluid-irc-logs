2020-04-09T17:22:04  <greatislander> I want to go to the one with Stéph :)
2020-04-09T17:22:21  <danayo> cherylhjli: greatislander beat me to it :)
2020-04-09T17:22:27  <greatislander> hahaha
2020-04-09T17:22:30  <cherylhjli> hahaha
2020-04-09T17:22:32  <danayo> :D
2020-04-09T17:22:39  <danayo> I’m fine to do the one with Brandon

2020-04-09T18:28:09  <colinclark> cherylhjli, greatislander, danayo: Trebor is on his best behaviour these days…
2020-04-09T18:28:21  <colinclark> He LOVED the new “meta header” design
2020-04-09T18:28:29  <colinclark> thought it was perfect and addressed all his concerns
2020-04-09T18:28:33  <danayo> fantastic colinclark :D
2020-04-09T18:28:35  <colinclark> (I think it looks great too)
2020-04-09T18:28:53  <cherylhjli> wow
2020-04-09T18:29:09  <colinclark> The only thing I think we have to figure out is what’s up with this whole images issue with Community Voices
2020-04-09T18:29:11  <colinclark> he seemed really confused
2020-04-09T18:29:24  <colinclark> and I hadn’t yet seen Cheryl’s latest email because of the lists being down
2020-04-09T18:29:47  <colinclark> So I think we just need to clarify in simple terms which images are needed and in which sizes
2020-04-09T18:30:10  <colinclark> he also said that he thought we could not have the “Testimonials” section of the site, since the Community Voices have all those nice quotes from different people
2020-04-09T18:30:12  <greatislander> nice!
2020-04-09T18:30:16  <colinclark> he felt it served the same purpose
2020-04-09T18:30:30  <greatislander> Okay cherylhjli and I can clarify the image issues
2020-04-09T18:30:30  <colinclark> so I ran with that, figuring that making one less section of the site was a good thing for all involved
2020-04-09T18:30:32  <greatislander> we will discuss later
2020-04-09T18:30:34  <greatislander> yes!
2020-04-09T18:30:42  <colinclark> thanks, that would be awesome if it’s not too much trouble
2020-04-09T18:31:00  <colinclark> Angela admitted that she probably has about three more weeks of work on the resources
2020-04-09T18:31:17  <colinclark> so they happily agreed that Nathan’s list can wait
2020-04-09T18:31:31  <colinclark> they were just confused because Angela said that it had conmpletely dropped off her radar
2020-04-09T18:31:41  <colinclark> I reassured them that it hadn’t fallen off ours ;)
2020-04-09T18:31:59  <colinclark> and then michelled said “it’s not a priority yet, but we will get to it when it’s needed”
2020-04-09T18:32:21  <colinclark> and the message about contacting CanTrust first for site issues was received loud and clear
2020-04-09T18:32:25  <colinclark> and without any protest
2020-04-09T18:32:45  <colinclark> “Great, no problem. I just wasn’t sure who” was Trebor’s response.
2020-04-09T18:33:42  <cherylhjli> okay, great
2020-04-09T18:33:45  <cherylhjli> and yes no problem at the community voices
2020-04-09T18:33:56  <cherylhjli> thanks ned for saying you'd email trebor
2020-04-09T18:34:06  <cherylhjli> trebor sounds so agreeable this week
2020-04-09T18:34:34  <colinclark> he’s very docile
2020-04-09T18:34:37  <danayo> d:)
2020-04-09T18:34:45  <colinclark> maybe that’s the wrong word
2020-04-09T18:34:46  <colinclark> mild
2020-04-09T18:34:51  <colinclark> he’s never docile
2020-04-09T18:37:20  <cherylhjli> haha definitely not

2020-04-09T22:07:00  <erictheise> hi all, just saw that OpenStreetMap US is focusing tonight’s “mappy hour” on accessibility. note this is about users contributing sidewalk, curbcut, and other realworld accessiblity features into OpenStreetMap and not about making accessible maps. still thought it might be of interest.
