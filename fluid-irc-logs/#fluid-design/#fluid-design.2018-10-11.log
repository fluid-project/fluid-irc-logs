2018-10-11T13:30:01  <danayo> hi Justin_o: A Cloud4All demo is listed in the spreadsheet for DEEP - I guess we could demo the PMT? would that be possible?
2018-10-11T13:32:18  <michelled> I'd say that would be difficult at this point danayo
2018-10-11T13:32:35  <michelled> if we want to demo something GPII related it should probably be APCP
2018-10-11T13:32:42  <michelled> since that's regularly being built and tested
2018-10-11T13:32:52  <michelled> I think trying to get C4A working at this point will be a lot of work
2018-10-11T13:32:57  <Justin_o> danayo: I agree with michelled about PMT
2018-10-11T13:33:02  <danayo> ok michelled, Justin_o
2018-10-11T13:33:17  <danayo> should we switch it to an APCP demo?
2018-10-11T13:33:21  <danayo> or just leave it?
2018-10-11T13:33:37  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@198.178.118.18> has joined #fluid-design
2018-10-11T13:33:57  <Justin_o> danayo, michelled: it would be nice to have a GPII demo if possible. And also to show the integration with UIO+ would be nice.
2018-10-11T13:34:06  <michelled> cindyli: what do you think? you'd be the obvious person to set up an APCP demo
2018-10-11T13:34:31  <michelled> or maybe clown?
2018-10-11T13:38:00  <cindyli> michelled: I can set it up on my windows VM. but it won't be able to connect to an NFC reader. as I remember, Alan set up a windows machine in the lab area with NFC reader and some NFC cards. i can check with Alan when he is online
2018-10-11T13:39:57  <cindyli> or, we can demo QSS and PSP with my windows VM, which doesn't require any external devices

2018-10-11T15:39:58  <carenwatkins_> Hi avtar
2018-10-11T15:40:37  <avtar> just wanted to check in regarding the video you were working on
2018-10-11T15:40:48  <avtar> is it okay if i hand that version to bert?
2018-10-11T15:42:54  <avtar> carenwatkins_: ^
2018-10-11T15:43:10  <jhung> danayo: the video I made for CMHR can be found here https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/XKdh86QKdpIRREZ
2018-10-11T15:43:27  <danayo> thanks jhung
2018-10-11T15:49:10  <carenwatkins_> avtar: is it being uploaded to the individual desktop computer for the demo room? I haven't changed the captioning contrast for projection so it shouldn't be part of the Black Box loop. Is that ok?
2018-10-11T15:49:57  <michelled> carenwatkins_: I think avtar is working on the set of videos for the black box theatre - I'm not sure who is working on the demo machines
2018-10-11T15:51:26  <Justin_o> carenwatkins_: if Lisa isn't able to write the years out for the timeline, is that something you'd be willing and able to do?
2018-10-11T15:51:55  <carenwatkins_> michelled: avtar when is the latest I can get a final video for insertion into the Black Box loop?
2018-10-11T15:52:51  <avtar> carenwatkins_: i'm handing a drive to bert today with all the other videos on it
2018-10-11T15:53:09  <danayo> avtar: WHAT TIME??
2018-10-11T15:53:20  <avtar> you could give him your video anytime and he'll be able to add yours to the playlist?
2018-10-11T15:53:27  <avtar> danayo: 3:01
2018-10-11T15:53:33  <carenwatkins_> Justin_o: what is the vision for the Timeline years? Hand written in a particular style?
2018-10-11T15:53:47  <danayo> perfect avtar. I’ll get mine to you at 3:00
2018-10-11T15:53:59  <avtar> just in time
2018-10-11T15:54:38  <carenwatkins_> Thanks avtar michelled
2018-10-11T15:54:47  <jhung> danayo: 3:00:59 to give some breathing room.
2018-10-11T15:55:00  <danayo> :D
2018-10-11T16:01:01  <danayo> jhung: the video looks good! I really don’t think we need to add anything, given the time we have
2018-10-11T16:03:00  <jhung> danayo: ok. Sounds fine to me. I'll get it together now.

2018-10-11T16:28:57  <carenwatkins_> Justin_o: to follow up re the Timeline, my bandwidth is a little tight but if we're looking for efficiencies perhaps we could print out 11x17 of each year. Maybe outline the type and colour in or add pattern by hand...or leave white.
2018-10-11T16:29:36  <Justin_o> carenwatkins_: sorry, missed your earlier message. Yes
2018-10-11T16:29:52  <Justin_o> i think we should fall back to printing them off if Lisa isn't able to do the writing.
2018-10-11T16:30:00  <Justin_o> I'm not exactly sure what her vision was for the style of it
2018-10-11T16:32:46  <carenwatkins_> Ok, once the main signage is finalized with the typesetting/size/etc. I'll add a file with the same specs for the timeline years so it's ready to go if needed.
2018-10-11T16:33:45  <carenwatkins_> Justin_o: ^
2018-10-11T16:36:04  <Justin_o> carenwatkins_: excellent thanks.. i have to head offline now, please e-mail me if you need anything though
