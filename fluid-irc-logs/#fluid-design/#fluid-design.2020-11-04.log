2020-11-04T12:22:19  <jhung> ping Justin_o you there?
2020-11-04T12:22:27  <Justin_o> jhung: hello
2020-11-04T12:22:46  <jhung> Can we chat in 10 minutes about the netlify checks Justin_o ?
2020-11-04T12:23:09  <Justin_o> jhung: sure, I'm assuming this is related to the UIO lunchbox PR you have
2020-11-04T12:23:47  <jhung> yep. I'm wondering if it's possible to do those checks before committing Justin_o
2020-11-04T12:23:49  <Justin_o> jhung: Also I have an 8am meeting, so I'll only be able to talk till then, but can pick it up again afterwards if needed
2020-11-04T12:24:30  <Justin_o> jhung: I don't think so, as they are done through a GitHub App.. I suppose you could install that on your own fork and deploy your branches as well
2020-11-04T12:26:12  <jhung> Justin_o interesting. It would be good to be able to run those checks like during lint, but it seems we need to commit first.
2020-11-04T12:31:05  <Justin_o> jhung: https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#run-builds-locally
2020-11-04T12:31:38  <Justin_o> jhung: you might be able to do `netlify build --dry`
2020-11-04T12:37:51  <jhung> I'll give that a try Justin_o
2020-11-04T12:38:31  <Justin_o> jhung: sounds good.. let me know if you need to chat still
