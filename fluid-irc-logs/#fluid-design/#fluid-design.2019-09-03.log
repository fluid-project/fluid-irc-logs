2019-09-03T19:19:31  <jhung> gmoss - do you want to sync up about ILDH dev today?
2019-09-03T19:20:20  <gmoss> jhung: what time do you think you'll head offline? I'm currently tied up with something and I have another meeting at 4 PM. maybe we can schedule some time next week?
2019-09-03T19:21:55  <jhung> I'll be online until 5p gmoss. I'd like to check in with you as there's an ILDH meeting Thursday and I want to make sure to get your thoughts before that meeting.
2019-09-03T19:24:51  <gmoss> jhung: okay, is 3:45 good for you, in that case?
2019-09-03T19:25:20  <jhung> gmoss sure. That works for me. It shouldn't take long.
2019-09-03T19:25:53  <michelled> cherylhjli, greatislander, jhung, danayo_: can we move our coop conference meeting to either 1 or 3 on Thursday?
2019-09-03T19:30:18  <cherylhjli> michelled: yes I'm fine with either!
2019-09-03T19:31:39  <danayo_> michelled: sure, my pref would be for 3
2019-09-03T19:32:13  <jhung> I'm fine with either michelled/
2019-09-03T19:38:22  <jhung> greatislander I'm looking at https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/learning-commons-framework/issues/6 and I'm trying to recall what we meant by "academic features". The data sketching notes isn't jogging my memory. Do you remember what this was? Was it the abstract generation?
2019-09-03T19:39:07  <greatislander> jhung I believe the idea was that that mainly covered the ability to generate a citation, links to DOI/resource records etc
2019-09-03T19:41:22  <jhung> Ah. That's right. The whole perma.cc discussion. I'll update that issue. Thanks greatislander.
