2020-06-25T12:43:09  <michelled> hey Justin_o - what's the status of the new floe project site?
2020-06-25T12:44:32  <Justin_o> michelled: I believe that there is a PR that is under review https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/163
2020-06-25T12:46:09  <michelled> is there an estimate of when it will land?
2020-06-25T12:47:52  <Justin_o> michelled: I'm not sure, I haven't personally reviewed it. I imagine things are going a bit slower based on gmoss and jhung's current priorities. Which I believe will relax a bit soon.
2020-06-25T12:48:34  <michelled> so, if I want to put in some new floe news, I should do that on the old site?
2020-06-25T12:59:38  <Justin_o> michelled: Yes, I think that should be fine, and the PR will just need to be updated.
2020-06-25T12:59:48  <Justin_o> maybe leave a note about it on the PR to make sure we don't miss it.
