2020-01-20T16:42:55  <erictheise> good morning all. today is going to be a little crazy here in Mexico City with an earthquake preparedness drill in a few minutes and later a tour of the house of architect Luis Barrag√°n.
2020-01-20T16:44:04  <erictheise> on Friday I pulled the ioo.coop data into a local Django installation with geo bells & whistles. have been trying to push it to heroku as that's usually easy for prototyping but the buildpacks have changed since I last did this. later this afternoon I'll complete that task and put up a prelimary map that draws from the styles outlined in pinecone.
