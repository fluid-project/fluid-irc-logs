2020-03-19T15:35:02  <colinclark> cherylhjli, greatislander: I think I’ve put all the sections that need copy into the Google Doc
2020-03-19T15:35:22  <colinclark> I can start writing some of the inner sections, like descriptions for projects and tools
2020-03-19T15:35:38  <colinclark> but I can see Jutta wanting to write the bulk of the rest of the site
2020-03-19T15:36:05  <colinclark> As with the We Count, seeing it up on the web with less-than-ideal content will be a big motivator, I think :)
2020-03-19T15:44:22  <erictheise> cherylhjli danayo greatlislander jhung check in now or wait unti top of the hour?
2020-03-19T15:45:22  <danayo> erictheise: we’re just in our daily check in meeting now
2020-03-19T15:45:24  <cherylhjli> hey erictheise unfortunately I can't check in today, going heads down on the idrc website
2020-03-19T15:45:48  <danayo> and I believe greatislander is heads down on that site too erictheise
2020-03-19T15:45:55  <danayo> but I”m happy to have a check in with you in a bit
2020-03-19T15:46:26  <danayo> I can ping you erictheise
2020-03-19T15:50:11  <erictheise> ok. cherylhjli & greatislander, microsite it up. danayo jhung mostly wanted to check in ahead of the new school meeting.

2020-03-19T16:11:57  <erictheise> I at least need to talk with them.
