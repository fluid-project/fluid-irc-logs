2020-06-22T14:16:41  <jhung> greatislander do you have a moment to chat about community voices? I have a question about filtering and other things.
2020-06-22T14:39:15  <greatislander> hi jhung, yep, gimme a moment
2020-06-22T15:21:43  <greatislander> jhung looks like there are a couple blocking items on that Pinecone PR (thanks to cherylhjli for catching them). I've added a comment about how I think they can be addressed, let me know if you have any questions.
2020-06-22T15:22:49  <jhung> greatislander ok. I'll take a look at it later today when I need a break from the Community Stories.
2020-06-22T15:22:55  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-06-22T15:56:35  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-06-22T15:59:16  <cherylhjli> do we need to check in greatislander danayo jhung?
2020-06-22T15:59:38  <jhung> cherylhjli - no I'm good. Caught up w greatislander earlier this morning.
2020-06-22T15:59:40  <greatislander> I do not need to
2020-06-22T16:00:15  <greatislander> Will hopefully have something to show you and danayo in terms of individual profile by the time you return from your appointment, cherylhjli
2020-06-22T16:00:37  <danayo> sounds great greatislander
2020-06-22T16:00:41  <cherylhjli> sounds good
2020-06-22T16:01:08  <cherylhjli> danayo - the mockups for individual profile is in the XD file, if you want to take a look
2020-06-22T16:01:43  <danayo> great thanks cherylhjli
2020-06-22T16:30:10  <gmoss> cindyli danayo Justin_o: are you available for ST check-in?
2020-06-22T16:30:19  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2020-06-22T16:30:41  <cindyli> yes, gmoss
2020-06-22T16:30:59  <gmoss> awesome :) I'm in the standup room
2020-06-22T16:33:38  <danayo> gmoss: be there in a minute!
2020-06-22T17:41:51  <danayo> gmoss: i had noted that at the moment, tabbing from delete button lands focus on the whole block, but I think it actually lands focus on the delete check box first, right?
2020-06-22T17:42:35  <gmoss> danayo: I'll confirm right now, but I believe it's the former. tabbing from delete button goes to whole block first, then reorder buttons, then checkbox
2020-06-22T17:43:31  <gmoss> it is as I described :)
2020-06-22T17:44:28  <danayo> ok thanks
2020-06-22T17:58:06  <danayo> gmoss, cindyli, Justin_o: I created 2 issues describing the Story Tool focus issues. It made sense to me to separate these out, please let me know if I missed anything or if something isn’t clear https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-365, https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-366
2020-06-22T17:58:16  <gmoss> danayo: thanks! checking them out now :)
2020-06-22T18:01:19  <gmoss> danayo: those both look great. I've added a link between 366 and 364, since they're related
2020-06-22T18:01:33  <danayo> ok gmoss
2020-06-22T18:01:49  <danayo> I just added a bit to 366 about disabling the re-order buttons appropriately
2020-06-22T18:02:12  <cindyli> thanks, danayo and gmoss
2020-06-22T18:04:27  <danayo> gmoss: I can’t remember if I said I’d create a JIRA for the disabled buttons contrast theme behaviour. I can’t find an existing JIRA, shall I create one?
2020-06-22T18:09:12  <michelled1> colinclark, Teddy___: I think we said we'd check in this week
2020-06-22T18:09:21  <michelled1> can we say tentatively at 3:00 eastern tomorrow?
2020-06-22T18:09:33  <michelled1> there's a chance I won't be around but hopefully I will be
2020-06-22T18:09:34  <colinclark> i’m free then, yup
2020-06-22T18:09:46  <Teddy___> Okay I am also free then
2020-06-22T18:10:06  <michelled1> great, thanks!
2020-06-22T18:57:00  <danayo> cherylhjli: do you have time now to check in?
2020-06-22T18:57:32  <cherylhjli> yep danayo! give me a few min, i'm just getting some lunch heated
2020-06-22T18:58:04  <danayo> ok cherylhjli, happy to meet when you’re done eating!
2020-06-22T18:59:48  <cherylhjli> aw thanks danayo! that'd be great. shouldn't take more than 10 min
2020-06-22T19:12:55  <cherylhjli> ok danayo - coop room?
2020-06-22T19:14:28  <danayo> cherylhjli: now I need 5, just meeting a delivery person
2020-06-22T19:14:32  <cherylhjli> yep!
2020-06-22T19:38:10  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo if you are looking at the Ngrok URL, please note I have to take it down for a moment
2020-06-22T19:38:29  <cherylhjli> ok greatislander
2020-06-22T19:38:33  <cherylhjli> thanks for the heads up
2020-06-22T19:39:06  <gmoss> danayo: Justin_o came up with a fix to SJRK-365
2020-06-22T19:39:13  <gmoss> seems to work great on my end
2020-06-22T19:39:31  <danayo> great gmoss, thanks Justin_o!
2020-06-22T19:40:04  <Justin_o> danayo: no problem, fortunately the reorderer component already provided a way to do the configuring we needed.
2020-06-22T19:40:13  <danayo> cool
2020-06-22T20:04:33  <cherylhjli> greatislander - danayo and I are done, let us know when you want us to hop back on
2020-06-22T20:06:11  <greatislander> k one moment
2020-06-22T20:11:12  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo ready
2020-06-22T20:11:14  <danayo> ok
2020-06-22T20:12:28  <gtirloni> cindyli: the wecount website is configured in netlify to build with `npm run generate` but I don't see that command in package.json. And yet, the deploys seem to be working. Do you have any idea how that's working?
2020-06-22T20:13:03  <cindyli> i thought it's built using "npm run build". let me check...
2020-06-22T20:13:09  <cindyli> gtirloni: ^
2020-06-22T20:13:51  <greatislander> hi cindyli and gtirloni, the Netlify configuration is overriden by this: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/netlify.toml#L2
2020-06-22T20:14:15  <cindyli> thanks, greatislander
2020-06-22T20:14:34  <gtirloni> ah mystery solved, thanks
2020-06-22T20:22:00  <cindyli> Teddy___: i found i wasn't using google account to login figma. I've been using a figma account
2020-06-22T20:22:52  <Teddy___> Okay thanks for letting me know, I just created a figma account myself
2020-06-22T20:23:22  <Teddy___> Never needed an account before. I'm guessing they must've changed their policy
2020-06-22T20:30:30  <cindyli> ya
2020-06-22T20:32:37  <erictheise> greatislander & gtirloni I got an email about a failed build after merging the big #84 pull request. apparently a problem with collectstatic. do you get these alerts too?
2020-06-22T20:33:58  <erictheise> error seems to be related to the removal of autocomplete light.
2020-06-22T20:34:15  <greatislander> erictheise I am not subscribed to those which is an oversight. Let me take a look.
2020-06-22T20:34:41  <erictheise> in merging the PR your branch became mine greatislander.
2020-06-22T20:36:00  <greatislander> aha, that makes sense
2020-06-22T20:41:03  <greatislander> erictheise https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/104
2020-06-22T20:43:32  <danayo> greatislander: added one item to the list in my comment re: labelling/description for Clients section
2020-06-22T20:43:48  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-06-22T20:44:09  <greatislander> erictheise looks like last deploy failed because of modified files on the server.
2020-06-22T20:51:55  <cindyli> gtirloni: thanks for the pr that adds docker to wecount webiste. I ran into this problem when testing it locally:
2020-06-22T20:51:57  <cindyli> $ docker build -t wecount .
2020-06-22T20:51:57  <cindyli> Sending build context to Docker daemon  1.147MB
2020-06-22T20:51:57  <cindyli> Step 1/8 : FROM node:12.18.0-alpine AS builder
2020-06-22T20:51:57  <cindyli> Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/node/manifests/12.18.0-alpine: unauthorized: incorrect username or password
2020-06-22T20:52:26  <gtirloni> greatislander erictheise: we probably need separate/segmented settings.py's so they can be specified for the environment the app is running on
2020-06-22T20:52:58  <danayo> gmoss I think you missed this earlier: I can’t remember if I said I’d create a JIRA for the disabled buttons contrast theme behaviour. I can’t find an existing JIRA, shall I create one?
2020-06-22T20:53:11  <gtirloni> cindyli: can you try to pull the image manually just to see if it finds it? I can't reproduce the error here
2020-06-22T20:53:16  <gtirloni> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/RnBEvDWM/
2020-06-22T20:53:28  <cindyli> ok
2020-06-22T20:53:33  <greatislander> gtirloni not sure I follow
2020-06-22T20:53:52  <gmoss> danayo: sorry, to clarify, do you mean the disabled reorderer up/down buttons or the other issue you noticed with the UIO panel?
2020-06-22T20:53:53  <cindyli> gtirloni: works
2020-06-22T20:54:22  <cindyli> gtirloni: thanks, proceeding with other steps
2020-06-22T20:54:58  <gtirloni> greatislander: I had to modify cmdi/settings.py because of the email changes that were required to work in the IDRC environment. If we commit those changes, someone deploying this somewhere else will probably have problems. The way I've worked with Django apps is to have various settings.py files with specific configuration (usually dev/prod/local, for instance)
2020-06-22T20:55:59  <gtirloni> greatislander eritctheise ^^ https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/lbR4awkg/
2020-06-22T20:56:44  <greatislander> gtirloni I see, thanks for clarifying
2020-06-22T20:57:20  <greatislander> Can you stash those changes so we can run the deploy for both environments, then reapply the stash?
2020-06-22T20:57:28  <gtirloni> ok, one sec
2020-06-22T20:57:32  <greatislander> I'd like to get dev deployed and also merge to master and deploy that to demo
2020-06-22T20:57:35  <greatislander> thanks
2020-06-22T21:00:19  <gtirloni> greatislander: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/runs/796940750?check_suite_focus=true
2020-06-22T21:00:43  <greatislander> thanks gtirloni! one second and I will do a merge to master
2020-06-22T21:01:37  <greatislander> okay, master is pushed
2020-06-22T21:04:40  <erictheise> gtirloni & greatislander, the mutliple settings files is common but I feel it’s an antiquated approach. this writer talks about 12 factor approach and the use of environment variables. https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/
2020-06-22T21:05:15  <greatislander> Environment variables would be ideal.
2020-06-22T21:05:18  <gtirloni> there's just too much configuration to put into env vars
2020-06-22T21:06:01  <gtirloni> I usually only put into env vars the configuration that changes per environment
2020-06-22T21:06:30  <gtirloni> so I've worked with, say, a base.py and local.py, dev.py, prod.py .. and those define certain env vars but not everything
2020-06-22T21:09:42  <greatislander> Is there a way to load just the email configuration from environment variables, gtirloni?
2020-06-22T21:11:08  <gtirloni> yep, let's start with that. I'll submit a PR
2020-06-22T21:19:19  <gtirloni> https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/105
2020-06-22T21:24:40  <greatislander> cherylhjli danayo can you check out the Ngrok site again? added some "clients" and the show more button so you can test that. Other adjustments are finished as well.
2020-06-22T21:25:41  <danayo> ok greatislander thanks
2020-06-22T21:27:22  <cherylhjli> looks great greatislander
2020-06-22T21:28:11  <danayo> it looks fabulous to me greatislander!
2020-06-22T21:28:46  <greatislander> okay, if one of you wants to hit the ol' approve button I'll get it merged :)
2020-06-22T21:30:04  <greatislander> danayo cherylhjli
2020-06-22T21:30:06  <greatislander> ^
2020-06-22T21:33:02  <danayo> done greatislander!
