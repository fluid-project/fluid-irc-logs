2019-03-19T18:18:59  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I had a look at your scenarios and they look great. I made some minor edits. I think the details of these scenarios will evolve as we do co-design and work with students, but I think what you have are excellent starting points.
2019-03-19T18:19:23  <sepidehshahi> great! thanks so much simonjb

2019-03-19T18:21:03  <simonjb> sepidehshahi: one of the things that I'm really interested in exploring is the relationship and connection between your sketchpad and coding modes of the 2nd scenario
2019-03-19T18:22:24  <sepidehshahi> same here! when I was writing the scenario, it seemed very inetersting to be able to switch between different input modes
