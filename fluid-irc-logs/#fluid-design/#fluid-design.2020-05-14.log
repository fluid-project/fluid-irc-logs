2020-05-14T13:22:22  <danielcho> simonjb: sounds good, I will continue on styling the toggle button — I am thinking of just creating a custom toggle button because customizing react bootstrap toggle button seems a lot of work
2020-05-14T13:25:00  <simonjb> danielcho: could we chat a little about the toggle button before you create your own? I'd like to understand the issues before we make our own component

2020-05-14T15:36:38  <danayo> michelled: I was going to ask you and gmoss if we could do storytelling checkin right after standup

2020-05-14T15:39:21  <michelled> danayo: maybe I can skip storytelling today? or join it late depending on how long it goes
2020-05-14T15:39:33  <danielcho> michelled: yeah, Simon and I can meet today
2020-05-14T15:40:18  <danayo> sure michelled

2020-05-14T17:33:26  <gmoss> Caren_: I just read your email asking about whether it makes sense for you to join the discussion about Static Site Generators next week. I think it would be great to have you there if you have time, especially if you have any feedback to offer about using any of the CMS's we're evaluating
2020-05-14T17:34:26  <gmoss> I don't think it has much direct impact on SNOW, fwiw, though it might influence our choices for future sites

2020-05-14T20:12:54  <jhung> erictheise I am setting up my .env configuration file. There's a line for a Here API key. Is this needed? I'm assuming this is different from the mapbox key?
2020-05-14T20:17:14  <erictheise> it is different from the Mapbox key, jhung; Mapbox’s terms of use don’t allow saving geocoded coordinates but I could not find that restriction with Here. my initial use was in a script that is not part of the app and I don’t think the app code that uses it is in master, or that it would block the app from loading. let me know if I’m wrong. should definitely track that in the next week.
2020-05-14T20:20:57  <jhung> erictheise ok. I'll sign up for a key now.
2020-05-14T20:24:20  <erictheise> this’ll be part of the project writeup I’m working on this weekend but we’re going to need institutional accounts for mapbox, here, google analytics, new relic … don’t know if those will reside with IDRC or New School but we shouldn’t wait until the last minute.
