2020-05-22T15:59:30  <greatislander> colinclark, alanharnum where should we meet?
2020-05-22T15:59:41  <colinclark> i’ll paste you a zoom link
2020-05-22T15:59:48  <alanharnum> greatislander colinclark: I may be a few minutes late, just finishing up another meeting
2020-05-22T15:59:55  <greatislander> sure thing
2020-05-22T15:59:55  <colinclark> no problem alanharnum
2020-05-22T16:27:29  <greatislander> erictheise I'm working on a build process that handles the CMDI-specific CSS and JS and also builds Pinecone. Wondering about the use of `envify` — what's it doing?

2020-05-22T16:30:06  <greatislander> oh, sure
2020-05-22T16:30:15  <erictheise> looking back to see about envify…

2020-05-22T16:54:12  <colinclark> alanharnum, greatislander I’m soooooo sorry!
2020-05-22T16:54:24  <colinclark> it’s hard to dodge a spontaneous Jutta call
2020-05-22T16:54:27  <colinclark> just got out now
2020-05-22T16:54:33  <colinclark> do we need to follow up on any logistics?
2020-05-22T16:56:12  <greatislander> nope, we're all good
2020-05-22T16:56:16  <greatislander> thanks colinclark
2020-05-22T16:57:41  <colinclark> that’s awesome
2020-05-22T16:57:54  <colinclark> so alanharnum, you’ll work half time on it wherever possible?
2020-05-22T16:59:01  <alanharnum> colinclark: yup, it sounded like greatislander's main need (correct me if I'm wrong) was to have someone with a bit more Django working experience to consult with and work on certain things - I'll attend the meeting on Monday as well, and am looking at codebase / documents
2020-05-22T16:59:19  <colinclark> perfect
2020-05-22T16:59:46  <colinclark> thank you so much
2020-05-22T17:17:01  <cindyli> Teddy___: have you started to work on improving the "tags" page - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/227? If not, i will start on it
2020-05-22T17:17:56  <Teddy___> Okay, no writing up the final results for the performance test in a matrix
2020-05-22T17:23:35  <cindyli> ok. i will start on it

2020-05-22T17:56:49  <erictheise> greatislander & gtirloni, the AWS server will be up and down for the next few minutes while I test the laravel branch with collectstatic.
2020-05-22T17:57:30  <greatislander> thanks erictheise
2020-05-22T17:58:02  <greatislander> I'll be off for the rest of the afternoon but will be doing some work later or tomorrow, most likely.
2020-05-22T17:58:35  <erictheise> coud you stick around for another 10 until I verify this in prod?
2020-05-22T18:01:31  <greatislander> sure!
2020-05-22T18:02:48  <erictheise> one momentary panic but looking better.
2020-05-22T18:03:46  <erictheise> can’t believe I’m installing PHP as a dependency for NPM as a dependency for a Python product.
2020-05-22T18:04:02  <greatislander> PHP?
2020-05-22T18:04:11  <erictheise> for laravel
2020-05-22T18:04:15  <greatislander> there's no PHP dependency, erictheise, unless I'm missing something
2020-05-22T18:04:32  <erictheise> oh, thought I needed it locally back in January.
2020-05-22T18:04:40  <erictheise> cool, I’ll drop it.
2020-05-22T18:04:43  <greatislander> nope.
2020-05-22T18:05:17  <greatislander> Laravel Mix is an asset-management NPM package which (as the name suggests) was created for the Laravel framework. But it's JS.
2020-05-22T18:06:56  <erictheise> got it. January was a long time ago. also tried to look at some WP stuff at the same time and muddled things in my mind.
2020-05-22T18:07:14  <erictheise> I’m going to merge and push to prod.
2020-05-22T18:07:17  <greatislander> January was a verrrrry long time ago
2020-05-22T18:07:21  <greatislander> sounds great!
2020-05-22T18:13:11  <greatislander> erictheise: looks like the deploy worked?
2020-05-22T18:13:42  <erictheise> think you may still have seen the branch deploy but now master is deployed
2020-05-22T18:14:38  <erictheise> get outta here greatislander.

2020-05-22T19:50:29  <cindyli> Teddy___: i thought about how to track performance in the table. having a screenshot for each test would still be hard to tell the difference. I think it might be better to track those 4 scores and having one extra "error" columns where you write down special error reported for that test case
2020-05-22T19:51:19  <cindyli> in this error, you can write down details by expanding that error on the screen
2020-05-22T19:53:32  <cindyli> for common errors such as not having "font-display: swap", you can skip that in the "error" column but write a generic section that applies to all test cases. using this way might be easier for ppl to tell the difference between each test case. what do you think?
2020-05-22T19:55:46  <Teddy___> Yeah that works
2020-05-22T19:56:12  <cindyli> ok. thanks
2020-05-22T19:56:42  <Teddy___> I added the those columns in the example on the google doc
2020-05-22T19:56:47  <Teddy___> let me know if I did it right
2020-05-22T19:58:45  <cindyli> Teddy___: i made changes. let me know if it makes sense
2020-05-22T19:59:18  <Teddy___> Oh okay I see what you mean thanks!
2020-05-22T20:00:01  <cindyli> the last 2 columns should be filled only when there are special info for that test case, Teddy___
2020-05-22T20:01:16  <Teddy___> okay
