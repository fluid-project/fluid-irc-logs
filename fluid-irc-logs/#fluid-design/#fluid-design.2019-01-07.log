2019-01-07T16:50:50  <cherylhjli> danayo & colinclark, FYI this is the iteration of Trebor's nav that I've been working through: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1mBhJG7_u5CNEnx1f9TxqPhpTtQYjzlXaflKsIr6BAZw/edit?usp=sharing

2019-01-07T16:54:12  <cherylhjli> danayo, Trebor also made a note in his new document regarding the learning commons - it seems that he's calling it the library now. I'm not 100% clear on what it is / how it's different from this "community voices" section he's added, but I've pushed for it a bit in the comments.
2019-01-07T16:59:55  <danayo> ok cherylhjli, I’ll take a look at that

2019-01-07T19:34:24  <cherylhjli> hey danayo, I've given my first go at the nav in the google draw I shared above. I'm still waiting for Trebor to go through and respond to my comments in his own nav document before I share the google draw. If you (and colinclark) have any thoughts or feedback before I share with Trebor, I'd love to hear them. :)

2019-01-07T19:43:31  <colinclark> cherylhjli: I think your approach is right—we can give Trebor a bit more time to elaborate in the comments
2019-01-07T19:43:37  <colinclark> but this diagram seems very good to me
2019-01-07T19:43:58  <colinclark> The only thing that stands out to me is the term "Library," which I realize is Trebor's
2019-01-07T19:44:36  <colinclark> though I can't say that I've liked the other names either—such as Learning Commons
2019-01-07T19:45:01  <colinclark> I wonder whether the "Start a local chapter" should be yellow instead of red?
2019-01-07T19:53:31  <danayo> thanks cherylhjli - I'm going to take a closer look at your doc now. I think it's really helpful to have it mapped out!
2019-01-07T19:54:47  <danayo> and cherylhjli, colinclark: I think I'd be more comfortable refering to our "first iteration" rather than our "Feb release"  :)
2019-01-07T19:55:09  <colinclark> sure, that seems reasonable
2019-01-07T19:55:11  <colinclark> maybe "first version"
2019-01-07T19:55:41  <colinclark> I know it's a minor point, but "iteration" is such a weird noun :)
2019-01-07T19:56:18  <cherylhjli> colinclark: yeah "library' is still super ambiguous… I think I'm still grappling with that concept, and the difference between that and "community voices". and good point re: local chapters
2019-01-07T19:56:37  <cherylhjli> hah, I remember when I was learning design I thought "iteration" was such a weird word
2019-01-07T19:56:46  <cherylhjli> very niche to design, maybe?
2019-01-07T19:56:57  <colinclark> Yeah, I think it's a bit of a technical buzzword
2019-01-07T19:58:11  <colinclark> iteration also has a funny implication, at least without its friend—incrementalism
2019-01-07T19:58:17  <colinclark> like spinning wheels :)
2019-01-07T19:58:43  <danayo> our first increment haha
2019-01-07T19:58:48  <danayo> first version sounds good to me :)
2019-01-07T20:03:33  <cherylhjli> first version it is! haha

2019-01-07T20:09:04  <cherylhjli> Re: Trebor's email, I'm assuming he means the interactive map?
2019-01-07T20:11:06  <michelled> cherylhjli: yes, I think so
2019-01-07T20:11:55  <michelled> cherylhjli: my original thoughts were that we would tackle the map in the summer
2019-01-07T20:12:31  <michelled> so I think you can suggest that we wait a bit, unless you think it's better to get a start right away
2019-01-07T20:13:58  <colinclark> Yeah, right now we've got it pencilled into our rough plan in later Q2 2019
2019-01-07T20:13:59  <colinclark> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+and+Technical+Roadmap+-+Platform+Co-op+Development+Kit
2019-01-07T20:14:10  <colinclark> the map, I mean
2019-01-07T20:15:44  <cherylhjli> hey michelled! hope you enjoyed your holidays :) If it's pencilled in for later in 2019 then let's keep it that way. Is it worth creating an "MVP" version of the map for now though, like just a simple list? Is it feasible from a development POV?
2019-01-07T20:19:17  <michelled> thanks! I did!
2019-01-07T20:19:45  <michelled> do you mean feasible as in prototyping it? we need to hire a developer, so we are going to be slow with development of any sort

2019-01-07T20:33:20  <danayo> cherylhjli: I think your nav map looks great
2019-01-07T20:33:33  <danayo> I don't see the interactive map in there - assuming it's part of the directory?
2019-01-07T20:33:39  <danayo> I think we should make that explicit
2019-01-07T20:34:07  <danayo> also - thinking perhaps "Our organisations" could be more clearly labelled as "Who we are" ?
2019-01-07T20:36:55  <cherylhjli> ah yes I like "who we are" so much better
2019-01-07T20:37:03  <cherylhjli> yes its a part of the directory - I can make that clear!
2019-01-07T20:37:13  <danayo> cherylhjli: great. the more I look at this the more I like your nav structure - it's really clear
2019-01-07T20:38:40  <cherylhjli> michelled, yes I was referring to actually prototyping it. Is it feasible for our first version to get something like a directory out, minus the map itself? I'm just seeing if there's a way to retain the intended goal of the map (finding a co-op), without actually doing the map - and if that'd be easier to do for the first version.
2019-01-07T20:39:02  <danayo> cherylhjli: and I think your "About Platform Coops" section answers to my comment at the top of Trebor's doc about needing a definition of platform coops on the landing page, or an obvious way to get to one quickly
2019-01-07T20:40:55  <michelled1> a simple list seems doable cherylhjli
2019-01-07T20:41:09  <michelled1> I'll be in the office tomorrow for sure, maybe we can talk a little more about it?
2019-01-07T20:43:04  <cherylhjli> danayo: Yes, and now that I'm sketching out ideas for the landing page, I think there's definitely an opportunity to include a 3-up right below the big splash image re: what a platform coop is
2019-01-07T20:43:32  <cherylhjli> michelled1: yes please! I'd love to go over all the site map with you and figure out what's feasible
