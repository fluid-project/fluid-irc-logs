2020-06-12T16:15:45  <erictheise> greatislander, there are 144 Organizations having geo_scope in the production database and they have been in there since before the transfer from AWS.
2020-06-12T16:16:27  <erictheise> you must be working with an old snapshot.
2020-06-12T16:26:38  <greatislander> yeah, I came to that conclusion looking at the database earlier. I'm currently updating my local copy.
2020-06-12T17:40:43  <greatislander> erictheise so it looks like the geo_scopes have been saved as 'Local, 'Regional', 'National', and 'International'. I'm going to open a PR to create a migration for the model to reflect the data.
2020-06-12T18:11:56  <greatislander> erictheise if you have a chance to review and merge these, they are blockers to the Organization flow work I'm doing: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/91, https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/92
2020-06-12T18:12:02  <greatislander> I'm taking the dog for a walk.
