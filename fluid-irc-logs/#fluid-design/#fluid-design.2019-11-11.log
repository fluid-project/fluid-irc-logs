2019-11-11T16:18:08  <Justin_o> danayo_: hello, just want to double check that you'll be able to join the Design Crit tomorrow
2019-11-11T16:21:43  <danayo_> thanks Justin_o - yes
2019-11-11T16:21:52  <danayo_> I have a meeting right after but I’ll be there!
2019-11-11T16:21:55  <danayo_> storytelling tool?
2019-11-11T16:22:04  <Justin_o> okay, great. yes, to talk about story telling

2019-11-11T16:51:56  <clown> jhung: the pop up to choose the IDRC meeing room (in zoom) is in the second dialog that you get after you click the "Join a Meeting" button on the first dialog
2019-11-11T16:52:40  <clown> there's a text entry for entering a meeting id or personal link.  On the right is a down arrow for popping up a list of choices.
2019-11-11T16:53:10  <clown> It looks like it's just a history list, no a list of bookmarks.
2019-11-11T16:53:16  <clown> *not
2019-11-11T16:53:18  <jhung> ok. I also found the room in the Contacts under "Company Directory" > "Zoom Rooms"
2019-11-11T16:53:56  <jhung> From there you can "Star" the room so it's under your starred contacts.
2019-11-11T16:57:49  <clown> whre is the is the "Company Directory", jhung?
2019-11-11T16:59:08  <jhung> clown it's located in the Contacts tab for me. It could be because I have an OCAD license this shows up?
2019-11-11T17:01:52  <clown> maybe, or you have an account.  I haven't gotten around to that partly because I can join the meeting/zoom room without signing in.

2019-11-11T18:49:44  <gmoss> danayo_: do you want to spend a little time today to chat about the new TIG resources for the SJRK site? I'm free all afternoon and into the evening
2019-11-11T18:49:54  <gmoss> no pressure to do that today, of course
2019-11-11T18:50:18  <danayo_> gmoss: I haven’t had a chance to go through them yet - I’ll do that today and then I likely will need to ask Liam for some input
2019-11-11T18:50:35  <gmoss> danayo_: sounds good :)
2019-11-11T18:50:39  <gmoss> I will wait patiently

2019-11-11T20:04:52  <danayo_> gmoss I went through the resources and pulled descriptions from each of the sites (for the ones that had no description). These should be good to go on the site now but let me know if you have any questions. Once their up I'll ask Liam to check them over.

2019-11-11T21:52:07  <gmoss> thanks danayo_! I still can't access the admin interface for the site, so the only way for me to add these new resources would be via the repo directly, but if that's okay I'll proceed with that right now :)
2019-11-11T21:54:04  <danayo_> gmoss I have no idea :p
2019-11-11T21:55:24  <gmoss> danayo_: well I only bring it up because Michelle mentioned in my last pull request that it would be ideal not to make changes via the code directly but to use the Netlify CMS interface instead, and I agree with that sentiment. just that this is my only option haha.. I don't think it's a critical problem in this particular case, so I'm inclined to make the change in code
2019-11-11T21:59:41  <danayo_> ok gmoss
2019-11-11T21:59:43  <danayo_> thanks
2019-11-11T22:01:53  <danayo_> gmoss I think michelle was suggesting that we need to fix the Netlify interface at some point so that the non-coders among us can make changes (not necessarily that it’s bad to make changes via the code)
