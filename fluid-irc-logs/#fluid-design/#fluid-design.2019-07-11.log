2019-07-11T17:24:12  <caren> sepidehshahi: further to our chat about Proprioception and kids: “Proprioception (or kinesthesia) is the sense though which we perceive the position and movement of our body, including our sense of equilibrium and balance, senses that depend on the notion of force (Jones, 2000).” Therefore weighted activities, hands/body on floor can be soothing.
2019-07-11T17:24:57  <caren> …and calming :-)
2019-07-11T17:25:21  <sepidehshahi> this is great thanks! kendraf and crystalchan please have a look at what caren has shared

2019-07-11T17:35:54  <jhung> hey gmoss, greatislander and I will be chatting about Wordpress development next week. Would you like to join us since it's possible that the new IDRC will be in WP.
2019-07-11T17:39:19  <caren> np crystalchan You and kendraf had  mentioned sensory integration and we talked fine and gross motor skills briefly at our desks…when we all chat  maybe we can consider ways to include these needs into the design of the activities. sepidehshahi
2019-07-11T17:39:36  <jhung> gmoss correction... the IDRC site may not be in WP, but the ILDH might be.
2019-07-11T17:39:59  <caren> within reason :-) sepidehshahi kendraf crystalchan
2019-07-11T17:40:09  <sepidehshahi> for sure

2019-07-11T18:10:56  <gmoss> jhung: yeah I'd like to join you and greatislander to talk about the website situation. I think we were planning on having a bit of discussion about that at the July 24th community meeting after the design crit part, but it would be great to be involved if it would help
2019-07-11T18:13:38  <jhung> gmoss yeah there might be some overlap, but I think the discussion next week is more about development tools and setting up an environment.
2019-07-11T18:15:28  <gmoss> jhung: hmm okay. how about you and greatislander find a time that works for both of you, and then if I'm able to join then I will :)
2019-07-11T18:16:15  <jhung> ok sounds good gmoss. I'll also be taking notes, so you can always refer to those if needed.
