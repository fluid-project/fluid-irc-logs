2020-09-16T13:31:06  <greatislander> Hi cindyli, I noticed https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/391 and I think the alternative of using WordPress will get the content editable much more quickly. Would you be open to a pull request?
2020-09-16T13:35:10  <cindyli> greatislander: good to know. yes, i will work on it but haven't started. the reason i was thinking to use Airtable as the first option is all content for the initiatives page can be edited at one spot, which might be more convenient for editors.
2020-09-16T13:36:54  <greatislander> Yes, that does make sense. I think the inability to edit page content in the expected way (rich text, etc) might be limiting.
2020-09-16T13:40:08  <cindyli> greatislander: yes, we thought about that. at the moment, there are only texts for the part that needs to be edited. if that part needs to have richer content in the future, we need to re-implement with WP + Airtable for the initiatives page. ya, maybe I should just implement WP now.
2020-09-16T13:40:14  <greatislander> My thinking was that this block could be added to the `page.njk` template between the home page layout and the general page layout, and the custom initiatives template could be eliminated:
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander> ```
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander> {% elif page.url === '/initiatives' %}
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander> <article class="page initiatives">
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander>   <h1>{{ pageTitle }}</h1>
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander> 	<div class="api-content">
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander>         {{ pageItem.content | safe }}
2020-09-16T13:40:30  <greatislander>     </div>
2020-09-16T13:40:31  <greatislander> 	<div>
2020-09-16T13:40:31  <greatislander> 		{% for workshop in collections.workshops %}
2020-09-16T13:40:32  <greatislander> 		<div class="api-content">
2020-09-16T13:40:32  <greatislander> 			{% include 'components/workshop.njk' %}
2020-09-16T13:40:33  <greatislander> 		</div>
2020-09-16T13:40:58  <greatislander> Then all that's required to pull that content from WP is a page with the title / slug "Initiatives" / "initiatives"
2020-09-16T13:41:13  <greatislander> let me know what you think, cindyli!
2020-09-16T13:43:53  <cindyli> greatislander: ya, looks even simpler than fetching from Airtable. i'm convinced with taking this approach :) thanks
2020-09-16T13:44:09  <greatislander> no problem!
2020-09-16T13:51:17  <greatislander> The new version of the IDRC site is live! https://idrc.ocadu.ca
