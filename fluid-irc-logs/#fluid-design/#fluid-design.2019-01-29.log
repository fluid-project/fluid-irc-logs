2019-01-29T14:40:12  <sepidehshahi> Caren he has mentioned their staff meeting is either at 11:00 or 12:00. I just sent him an email and asked him to let us know what time we should be there.
2019-01-29T14:42:21  <sepidehshahi> Caren are you available to meet this afternoon to go over things we need for tomorrow?

2019-01-29T14:47:11  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: I wonder if we could meet this morning in case there is some prep that needs some time. Also: is the workshop supposed to happen during the staff meeting--sorry, I'm attempting to schedule a meeting tomorrow and don't want it to be anywhere near the workshop time.
2019-01-29T14:48:36  <sepidehshahi> sure, what time is good for you to meet? I’ll be in the office in the afternoon to prepare anything needed for tomorrow
2019-01-29T14:49:18  <sepidehshahi> I’d say we should leave 10:30 to 2:30 open tomorrow carenwatkins_
2019-01-29T14:51:08  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: how about 10am to meet? (And thanks for the time span)
2019-01-29T14:52:39  <michelled> hi simonjb, do you have a few minutes to talk?

2019-01-29T15:15:31  <alanharnum> michelled colinclark: this may be relevant to some of the platform co-op tools: https://www.mapzen.com/
2019-01-29T15:16:22  <alanharnum> I wasn't aware of it previously, but it appears to be built on top of Open Street Map, and aiming to provide routing directions and other features that have been a bit more lacking in the open-source mapping platforms
2019-01-29T15:19:55  <michelled> awesome! thanks alanharnum
2019-01-29T15:20:46  <alanharnum> that said, looking more closely, I'm not sure how much that's available in "pure" open source form - but it looks promising and has a free tier for requests

2019-01-29T20:11:50  <carenwatkins_> sepidehshahi: I put it right at the end of the letter, post signature. If you think it's ok to keep the info, I vote to keep it to build awareness where possible. In fact, I think that "boiler plate" info from he site should include Since 1993 somewhere :-)
2019-01-29T20:12:41  <sepidehshahi> I just had a look at the document and it looks great. I also vote for keeping it and I like it’s new placement :)
