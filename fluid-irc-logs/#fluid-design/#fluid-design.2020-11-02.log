2020-11-02T16:40:58  <danayo> cherylhjli, gmoss what is the alt-text activity?
2020-11-02T16:42:34  <cherylhjli> danayo: have you ever played telestrations, the board game? it's like broken telephone with a group of people, but you go from drawing to word to drawing to word
2020-11-02T16:42:54  <cherylhjli> ex. I am given the word "elephant", I have to draw an elephant, and the next person can only see my drawing (but not the word), and has to guess what it is
2020-11-02T16:43:10  <cherylhjli> I think Lisa wants to use this as a way to run an alt text activity, to teach people how to write alt text
2020-11-02T16:43:29  <cherylhjli> a group of us are test running this activity to see how it works
2020-11-02T16:43:38  <danayo> cool cherylhjli, thanks!
2020-11-02T16:43:41  <gmoss> cherylhjli: nailed it! thanks for that. I was having trouble listening and crafting a reply haha
2020-11-02T16:44:05  <danayo> i’ve never played telestrations, but broken telephone is always fun :)
2020-11-02T16:44:44  <cherylhjli> haha yeah it's a really fun party game
2020-11-02T16:44:53  <cherylhjli> and by "party" i mean 6+ people :P
2020-11-02T16:47:56  <gmoss> I think that qualifies as a raucous reunion, these days
2020-11-02T17:02:54  <Justin_o> danayo: look what gtirloni was able to deploy https://build-discoverycat.fluidproject.org/demo/
2020-11-02T17:05:49  <greatislander[m]> I played telestrations at a conference once and one of the resulting phrases ("truck sheep") ended becoming the semi-official conference mascot going forward
2020-11-02T17:05:55  <greatislander[m]> (it was supposed to be a toy poodle)
2020-11-02T17:08:32  <danayo> Justin_o !!!!!
2020-11-02T17:08:38  <danayo> that’s so great
2020-11-02T17:08:42  <michelled> DISCOVERY CATS!!! :)
2020-11-02T17:08:43  <danayo> thanks gtirloni :D
2020-11-02T17:08:59  <danayo> omg I love it so
2020-11-02T17:09:21  <danayo> I forgot about the music :D
2020-11-02T17:10:00  <gtirloni> :D
2020-11-02T17:53:29  <greatislander[m]> Justin_o: pinging you here as well just in case you aren't in Matrix
2020-11-02T17:53:37  <greatislander[m]> I've got a couple questions about the index for the Infusion builds
2020-11-02T19:01:01  <gmoss> Justin_o michelled: shall we meet for Storytelling Check-in? hopefully danayo comes back online soon
2020-11-02T19:01:16  <gmoss> I'm free until 16:00 either way
2020-11-02T19:01:16  <michelled> yeah, I wonder if she lost internet or something
2020-11-02T19:01:25  <gmoss> seems likely! she said she was tethering
