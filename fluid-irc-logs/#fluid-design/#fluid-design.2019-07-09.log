2019-07-09T15:53:51  <cherylhjli> I don't think we do, but I was just going to chat with danayo about a few questions I had re: SEWA (and maybe other little bits and bobs of design updates). y'all are welcome to join either way :)
2019-07-09T15:54:00  <cherylhjli> danayo_ I just need a moment.. i'm starving haha

2019-07-09T15:55:16  <jhung> I don't have anything to update. Looks like we have a few meetings scheduled this afternoon already.
2019-07-09T15:55:44  <jhung> caren which meeting were you referring to about the ILDH? What time is that?
2019-07-09T15:58:29  <caren> jhung: the 3pm meeting named Storytelling Planning. We are talking ILDH in that weekly meeting…for now. Gregor, Dana, Michelle, Colin (away) are the usuals.
2019-07-09T15:59:49  <michelled> I'll change the name in the calendar :)
2019-07-09T15:59:57  <jhung> ok caren I have another meeting at 3:30p. Is it possible to talk about the ILDH first before I have to leave?
2019-07-09T16:00:16  <caren> thanks, michelled !
2019-07-09T16:00:40  <cherylhjli> danayo_ - my room?
2019-07-09T16:00:50  <danayo_> caren: I will also need to leave the meeting at 3:30, sorry about that - we scheduled a coop community checkin meeting
2019-07-09T16:01:34  <caren> jhung: the whole meeting will be ILDH and I’ll be showing some designs.
2019-07-09T16:04:23  <danayo_> sorry cherylhjli just give me a few minutes
2019-07-09T16:04:25  <danayo_> I’ll ping you
2019-07-09T16:04:25  <jhung> caren ok. I'll manage this somehow (might show up a little late to the next meeting).
2019-07-09T16:04:34  <cherylhjli> take your time danayo_
2019-07-09T16:05:35  <caren> ok, jhung.
2019-07-09T16:05:47  <caren> ok, danayo_
2019-07-09T16:06:51  <jhung> cherylhjli danayo_ michelled greatislander - for platform coop meetings on the schedule, could the meeting venue be included in the info? I'm finding it challenging to track where these meetings are being hosted.
2019-07-09T16:07:21  <danayo_> good idea jhung :)
2019-07-09T16:07:23  <danayo_> for sure
2019-07-09T16:07:30  <jhung> thanks! :)
2019-07-09T16:07:52  <danayo_> sorry for any confusion this morning jhung
2019-07-09T16:14:25  <jhung> danayo_ nothing to apologize for. Saw that meeting was on Skype, but I was late and didn't feel comfortable jumping in so late.
2019-07-09T16:19:46  <danayo_> cherylhjli: quick chat now?

2019-07-09T17:00:38  <danayo_> michelled: the SJRK site background looks a bit odd with the doubling-up of the background image, but I think it’s better than what was happening before
2019-07-09T17:01:21  <michelled> cool, thx danayo_ - I think making a new background image might help with that but I'd need to learn new skills or steal avtar's time
2019-07-09T17:01:47  <danayo_> why does it need a new background image michelled ? maybe I can do it?
2019-07-09T17:01:54  <danayo_> just need to understand the issue
2019-07-09T17:03:52  *** clown <clown!clown@nat/ocadu/x-hpehpxdydfaujrbd> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2019-07-09T17:04:00  <michelled> cherylhjli: thanks for taking those notes and sharing them - it's so helpful!
2019-07-09T17:06:26  <michelled> danayo_: I'm not certain that it necessarily does - my fix was to change the image so that it doesn't scale because that isn't something we want and so instead it uses the background image 'repeat'
2019-07-09T17:06:57  <michelled> I'm wondering if the size of the image is causing that overlap in the repeat - or if maybe the image itself has some overlap - I haven't looked at it closely enough
2019-07-09T17:07:58  <michelled> danayo_: yeah, look at the image - it does have some overlapping pieces of confetti https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/blob/master/static/images/background.png
2019-07-09T17:09:30  <danayo_> michelled: I think the overlap is ok, it’s the repeat that I think looks a bit odd
2019-07-09T17:10:01  <danayo_> michelled: on the right hand side of the screen
2019-07-09T17:10:12  <danayo_> I see that the image is shifted/repeating
2019-07-09T17:10:18  <danayo_> do you see what I mean?
2019-07-09T17:11:05  <danayo_> not shifted, sorry
2019-07-09T17:11:07  <danayo_> just repeating :)
2019-07-09T17:11:10  <danayo_> as you said
2019-07-09T17:11:12  <danayo_> :)
2019-07-09T17:11:45  <michelled> yeah, that's the strategy
2019-07-09T17:12:05  <michelled> repeat instead of scale
2019-07-09T17:12:14  <michelled> I don't know if there are other alternatives
2019-07-09T17:12:18  <danayo_> got it
2019-07-09T17:12:20  <danayo_> yeah
2019-07-09T17:12:54  <danayo_> a bigger image I suppose might not help, unless it were implemented differently? (cut off in a frame, rather than filling the whole background?)
2019-07-09T17:13:04  <danayo_> if that makes sense, michelled
2019-07-09T17:13:10  <michelled> I think that would work danayo_
2019-07-09T17:14:38  <danayo_> ok michelled - so it would need both a larger image and a different implementation?
2019-07-09T17:15:08  <danayo_> or we scale it up a bit to begin with
2019-07-09T17:15:12  <michelled> no, I think the implementation would stay the same
2019-07-09T17:18:47  <danayo_> michelled - looking closer, I’m seeing that it’s doing a double-repeat on the right edge.  if it were to just repeat once, I think it would look fine
2019-07-09T17:20:19  <michelled> I'm not seeing a double repeat - what browser are you using?
2019-07-09T17:23:28  <danayo_> both chrome and firefox michelled
2019-07-09T17:23:36  <danayo_> i just added an attachment to the JIRA
2019-07-09T17:23:41  <michelled> thx
2019-07-09T17:26:14  <danayo_> michelled: updated the attachment for clarity
2019-07-09T17:27:31  <michelled> so weird danayo_ - it doesn't look like that for me at all!
2019-07-09T17:27:39  <danayo_> oh wow michelled
2019-07-09T17:27:41  <danayo_> hmmm
2019-07-09T17:29:23  <danayo_> and it’s not the width of your screen michelled? that’s maybe not revealing that edge?
2019-07-09T17:29:56  <danayo_> if it’s wide enuf michelled , the main content blocks that repeat edge
2019-07-09T17:30:07  <danayo_> and if narrow enuf, it’s off-screen
2019-07-09T17:31:12  <michelled> I'll look again tomorrow on a bigger screen danayo_ - maybe this screen is too narrow to show it
2019-07-09T17:31:32  <danayo_> ok michelled thanks, definitely no rush

2019-07-09T19:05:05  <greatislander> yes, you're right
2019-07-09T19:05:12  <greatislander> time zones are the bane of my existence
2019-07-09T19:05:23  <danayo_> I”m feeling that greatislander
2019-07-09T19:05:35  <gmoss> (greatislander btw we're in EDT right now, not EST :P)
2019-07-09T19:06:07  <cherylhjli> oh my goodness I didnt even know the dfiference between EDT and EST
2019-07-09T19:06:18  <gmoss> UTC is best haha
2019-07-09T19:06:18  <greatislander> sigh
2019-07-09T19:06:57  <jhung> I propose we start using star dates.
2019-07-09T19:07:20  <greatislander> I'm reminding myself to bookmark this again: https://everytimezone.com/
2019-07-09T19:07:54  <danayo_> oooooh I like that greatislander
2019-07-09T19:08:22  <greatislander> yeah, it helps to map them out that way
2019-07-09T19:10:23  <danayo_> I also think star dates are a good idea jhung :D

2019-07-09T20:24:34  <gmoss> jhung: re star dates, UTC (and the SI definition for a second) is based on (iirc) the oscillations of EM radiation from electronics transferring between levels of a caesium atom, so this is something that could reasonably used as a stardate :) at least when we're talking non-relativistic speeds within a given frame of reference
2019-07-09T20:25:09  <gmoss> stretching my memory real hard there haha.. this is the extent of what a minor in astrophysics gets you
2019-07-09T20:26:33  <gmoss> caren jhung danayo_: I discussed with Justin_o and lliskovoi, we can use the July 24th Community Meeting slot for a design crit about the ILDH and subsequent technical discussion
2019-07-09T20:26:58  <caren> ok, thanks gmoss
2019-07-09T20:27:12  <gmoss> caren: are you okay being listed as the "Facilitator" on the wiki page? it's just a formality
2019-07-09T20:27:59  <caren> yes, that’s ok. Thanks for asking :-)
2019-07-09T20:28:11  <gmoss> great, thanks caren :)
2019-07-09T20:30:04  <jhung> thanks gmoss.
2019-07-09T20:34:01  <gmoss> *I wrote "electronics", I meant "electrons"
