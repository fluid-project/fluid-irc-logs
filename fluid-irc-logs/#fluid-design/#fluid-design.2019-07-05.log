2019-07-05T16:10:50  <michelled> sepidehshahi: do you have a preference for timing of the BiT meeting the week of the 15th?
2019-07-05T16:10:59  <michelled> if not, I can organize with Dana on Monday and respond
2019-07-05T16:11:58  <sepidehshahi> Hi michelled, I’m available at all those dates
2019-07-05T16:12:10  <michelled> cool!
2019-07-05T16:19:07  <avtar1> sepidehshahi, simonjb: do you have any thoughts regarding suzie's question about iste attendants having received postcards with or without stickers?
2019-07-05T16:21:03  <avtar1> either way i think we should probably decide on a promotional email schedule and what developments warrant newsletter type emails
2019-07-05T16:22:03  <sepidehshahi> Hi avtar1, there has been one response added after the ISTE to the old survey
2019-07-05T16:23:13  <sepidehshahi> it’s an educator who wants to receive updates about the project and accessed the survey on 23rd of June. I just saw that response and I can send it to you
2019-07-05T16:24:18  <sepidehshahi> avtar1: I just sent it to you on Skype
2019-07-05T16:24:23  <avtar1> thanks

2019-07-05T16:25:16  <avtar1> i was wondering due to suzie having asked that question and not having enough context to answer :)

2019-07-05T20:22:45  <colinclark> or blue
2019-07-05T20:22:47  <colinclark> or cyan
2019-07-05T20:23:37  <cherylhjli> haha I can't even tell anymore colinclark
2019-07-05T20:24:25  <colinclark> it reminds me of the kind of colour you should use when you’re writing emails in Comic Sans
