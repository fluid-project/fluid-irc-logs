2020-09-14T13:52:45  <greatislander> morning Justin_o, I've opened a pull request which uses CSS custom properties for the contrast themes. Are you available for a quick chat about it?
2020-09-14T14:16:23  <Justin_o> greatislander: sorry, I didn't notice your message till now. I'm free to chat now if you like
2020-09-14T14:20:15  <greatislander> okay great!
2020-09-14T14:20:20  <greatislander> general room?
2020-09-14T14:24:58  <greatislander> justin_o ^
2020-09-14T14:26:45  <Justin_o> sure
2020-09-14T14:26:49  <Justin_o> greatislander: ^
2020-09-14T14:41:49  <greatislander> gmoss throwback to a conversation I had with you and Justin_o when I was at the office last fall after DEEP: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1007 :)
2020-09-14T14:43:21  <gmoss> greatislander: :) thanks for doing that work! hopefully we can take advantage of it in the Storytelling Tool
2020-09-14T14:44:30  <greatislander> indeed!
2020-09-14T14:44:33  <gmoss> it's always jarring to see "colour" written the American way, though it makes perfect sense given the CSS property is too
2020-09-14T14:44:41  <greatislander> yeah…
2020-09-14T14:45:55  <gmoss> (reading your notes now)
2020-09-14T14:55:04  <gmoss> greatislander: I'm excited for this. I think it will allow us to cut quite a few lines out of the ST's base theme CSS file
2020-09-14T14:55:51  <greatislander> nice!
2020-09-14T14:56:04  <greatislander> let me know if there's anything I can do to help with that, gmoss
2020-09-14T14:57:10  <gmoss> greatislander: many thanks :)
2020-09-14T14:57:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: just to confirm, there won't be a storytelling check-in today?
2020-09-14T14:58:57  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2020-09-14T14:59:29  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm unable to make it, and I think everyone else is on vacation or otherwise indisposed, so that's correct
2020-09-14T14:59:44  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-09-14T15:03:07  <cindyli> hi philip, are you coming to the wecount meeting?
2020-09-14T15:03:56  <cindyli> Uttara: ^
2020-09-14T15:07:48  <Uttara> cindyli: yes in 2 minutes. My internet is resetting
2020-09-14T16:25:30  <Teddy___> cindyli: Uttara should I add the fourth tile that was sent in the email?
2020-09-14T16:26:36  <cindyli> Teddy___: i will do it. please focus on completing the comment page. thanks
2020-09-14T16:29:35  <Teddy___> Okay
2020-09-14T16:33:25  <cindyli> thanks
2020-09-14T17:45:24  <sbates> alanharnum: danielcho is currently working on making the "scene" area of the C2LC coding environment accessible, would I be right in remembering that you did a bunch of research and work in the past on SVG accessibility?
2020-09-14T17:46:26  <alanharnum> sbates danielcho: yes, it's summarized in this ILDH article (https://handbook.floeproject.org/SVGAndAccessibility.html) - though it may need updating
2020-09-14T17:47:12  <alanharnum> Sara Soueidan's material on SVG accessibility and SVG generally is very useful: https://www.sarasoueidan.com/tags/svg/
2020-09-14T17:48:24  <sbates> awesome, thanks Alan. did you do work with SVGs consisting of smaller pieces that you wanted to make browseable as independent pieces?
2020-09-14T17:48:42  <danielcho> thanks alanharnum for the links!
2020-09-14T17:49:06  <sbates> in our case, our scene consists of a grid of 9x5 cells and we'd like to have descriptions for each of the grid cells https://develop-0-4--c2lc-build.netlify.app/
2020-09-14T17:50:23  <Justin_o> sbates, danielcho, alanharnum: regarding Sara Soueidan, I came across this recently. I haven't had a chance to read it yet though. https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accessible-data-charts-for-khan-academy-2018-annual-report/
2020-09-14T17:51:16  <alanharnum> sbates: we didn't do that for the work we did on the chart tool, but IIRC a big part is the use of appropriate role attributes for different parts of the SVG
2020-09-14T17:52:05  <alanharnum> this is an older article, but still helpful with the guidelines: https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/12/using-aria-enhance-svg-accessibility/
2020-09-14T17:52:17  <sbates> thanks alanharnum
2020-09-14T17:52:57  <alanharnum> the <desc> element is also important: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc
2020-09-14T17:53:35  <alanharnum> some of the challenge is the usual "what's in the spec vs. how it works in the browser" :/
2020-09-14T17:54:25  <danielcho> thanks Justin_o, the difference between aria-describedby and aria-labelledby is very interesting in that post
2020-09-14T18:01:09  <Uttara> Actually Philip, me and Lisa are meeting at 5 to brainstorm some design things. Would you wanna join then instead?
2020-09-14T18:01:48  <Justin_o> danielcho: I'm not sure, but I wonder if there is configuration for ATs to not announce the description. Sometimes things get too verbose and some users may like to skip over some announcements.
2020-09-14T18:02:35  <philip> Uttara: That sounds perfect, except I have a non-work meeting at 5pm
2020-09-14T18:02:41  <sbates> thanks alanharnum and Justin_o for your help
2020-09-14T18:07:29  <philip> Uttara: If there's any way that could happen earlier I would love to join
2020-09-14T18:07:36  <danielcho> Justin_o: yeah, that's a good point, Lorna might have some answers to configuration for ATs
2020-09-14T18:22:29  <Uttara> Philip: Unfortunately Lisa has a doctor s appointment and will be back by 4,30. Should you can I get started at 4.30 and then she can join whenever she gets back? Does that work?
2020-09-14T18:24:08  <philip> Uttara: Yeah, sounds like a good compromise
2020-09-14T20:28:45  <Uttara> philip: I will see you in the wecount room
