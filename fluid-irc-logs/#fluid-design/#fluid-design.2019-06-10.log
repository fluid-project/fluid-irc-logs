2019-06-10T16:21:06  <danayo_> cherylhjli: can you meet at 2:30?
2019-06-10T16:21:16  <cherylhjli> sure danayo!
2019-06-10T16:21:20  <danayo_> great
2019-06-10T16:22:58  <danayo_> michelled: I just noticed that the SJRK background image also scales up when any of the UIO sizing preferences are set (font size, line spacing, enhance inputs)
2019-06-10T16:23:06  <danayo_> should I create a separate JIRA for that?
2019-06-10T16:23:17  <michelled> no, please add a comment to the one you created
2019-06-10T16:23:22  <danayo_> ok will do

2019-06-10T17:01:40  <michelled> danayo_: you can add the resources and partners images now https://www.sojustrepairit.org/resources/
2019-06-10T17:02:31  <michelled> danayo_: if you get a message ever that you need to fill in a field before publishing, try putting in a couple spaces. I haven't figured out yet how to configure a main page for a section differently from the subpages for the section
2019-06-10T17:02:51  <danayo_> ok michelled
2019-06-10T17:04:25  <danayo_> michelled:  I can’t find the image url in Netlify
2019-06-10T17:05:05  <michelled> danayo_: https://www.sojustrepairit.org/admin/#/collections/partners/entries/_index
2019-06-10T17:05:09  <michelled> do you see it there?
2019-06-10T17:05:13  <michelled> it's the last item
2019-06-10T17:05:21  <michelled> before the body
2019-06-10T17:06:06  <danayo_> i see it there michelled - I was looking on the resources page
2019-06-10T17:06:33  <michelled> I see it as the last item before the body on the resources page too https://www.sojustrepairit.org/admin/#/collections/resources/entries/_index
2019-06-10T17:07:19  <danayo_> so weird michelled
2019-06-10T17:07:26  <danayo_> i see it at the links you provided
2019-06-10T17:07:39  <michelled> maybe your browser was caching?
2019-06-10T17:07:42  <danayo_> but when I tried to just go there in Netlify it didn’t show the IMGURL
2019-06-10T17:07:46  <danayo_> yeah maybe
2019-06-10T17:14:16  <danayo_> great michelled - now we have all the partners represented by the photos :)
2019-06-10T17:14:26  <michelled> nice!
2019-06-10T17:17:08  <danayo_> and the site feels so much more alive to me michelled - hurrah
2019-06-10T17:18:12  <danayo_> oh michelled - just realised - I can’t see a way to add descriptions and captions
2019-06-10T17:18:34  <michelled> ah, good point danayo_ I think I'll need to add those as front matter fields too
2019-06-10T17:18:38  <danayo_> ok cool
2019-06-10T17:19:51  <danayo_> one more thing michelled - I noticed that the photos on the Partners and Resources pages are larger than / outside the text margins
2019-06-10T17:20:07  <michelled> oh! good catch

2019-06-10T19:57:55  <jhung> gmoss do you mean the contrast design for the Storytelling website, or the practice of creating contrast themes into designs in general?
2019-06-10T19:58:05  <gmoss> jhung: I meant in general
2019-06-10T19:58:34  <gmoss> to see what people thought of the idea, how it might be best implemented, etc
2019-06-10T19:59:07  <gmoss> jhung: but we could also look at the tool if we want a concrete example! I don't mind showing my latest work
2019-06-10T20:01:16  <jhung> gmoss I think it would help if we had a concrete example to work from. I'll see if I can dig up prior examples as well.
2019-06-10T20:02:57  <jhung> I'll put that into this into the schedule and send out the email. Do you mind taking the lead on the discussion gmoss?
