2019-07-16T19:19:16  <simonjb> if the web content doesn't match the language of the system, we may be using a font with missing glyphs or font variations
2019-07-16T19:23:56  <simonjb> or that is optimised for a laying out a different language
2019-07-16T19:31:18  <michelled> cindyli, gmoss: storytelling?

2019-07-16T19:32:33  <Justin_o> simonjb: a language mismatch is really interesting issue, but I wonder if we already have that issue with any of our font choices
2019-07-16T19:32:37  <gmoss> Can we meet at 4?
2019-07-16T19:32:42  <michelled> no, I have another meeting

2019-07-16T19:49:02  <simonjb> simonjb: the whole download for Noto is big though
2019-07-16T19:49:11  <Justin_o> simonjb: I was reading this article just now https://tech.busuu.com/handling-css-font-stacks-for-multi-language-websites-cf852e321f06
2019-07-16T19:49:24  <Justin_o> one of the critiques for using fonts that support all languages is that they are big
2019-07-16T19:49:34  <Justin_o> they used separate font stacks per language
2019-07-16T19:49:38  <simonjb> yeah
2019-07-16T19:50:28  <Justin_o> which I guess we could just start by handling the languages we have localization for, as we don't know all the languages that users may want to use it with
2019-07-16T19:50:32  <simonjb> I guess that's an advantage of using fonts that come with the OSes -- they don't need to be downloaded
2019-07-16T19:50:41  <Justin_o> simonjb: yes, that's true
2019-07-16T19:50:49  <simonjb> agreed
2019-07-16T19:51:12  <Justin_o> although I've heard that comic sans isn't supported across all OSs.
2019-07-16T19:51:46  <Justin_o> which leads to my next question, but having the specific name in the text style selection, it may be misleading when the page doesn't actually render in the request typeface
2019-07-16T19:52:08  <Justin_o> maybe we should have more generic names for them that capture some quality of the font rather that suggesting a specific font is going to be used
2019-07-16T19:52:43  <alanharnum> simonjb Justin_o: I wonder if it's possible to detect if a font is available on a platform
2019-07-16T19:52:54  <alanharnum> So you could do a similar presentation to the user like the CSS font cascade
2019-07-16T19:53:00  <Justin_o> simonjb: I have to run now, but I'd like to hear more of your thoughts. I'll either catch up here or chat with you tomorrow
