2018-10-02T19:46:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: the Presentation Translation works well enough. I ran through an old presentation I'd made a few years ago about HTML best practices and it correctly transcribed about 90% of it. It had a delay of a second or two before it provided subtitles, and it's fairly configurable. I didn't try speaking to it in French and seeing if it translated to English accurately (or vice versa) but maybe when you're feeling better we
2018-10-02T19:46:52  <gmoss> can give it a go
2018-10-02T19:49:01  <gmoss> I also didn't try running it without an internet connection
