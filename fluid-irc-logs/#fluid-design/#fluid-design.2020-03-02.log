2020-03-02T21:28:41  <colinclark> amazing!!!
2020-03-02T21:28:43  <colinclark> yes
2020-03-02T21:28:50  <michelled> thanks so much greatislander!
2020-03-02T21:28:53  <colinclark> Thank you so much
2020-03-02T21:28:57  <michelled> are you able to add a couple news pieces?
2020-03-02T21:29:00  <greatislander> no prob!
2020-03-02T21:29:13  <greatislander> I saw the email you forwarded, Michelle— those ones?
2020-03-02T21:29:27  <michelled> yeah, let me forward another - it has some text related
2020-03-02T21:29:31  <greatislander> okay
2020-03-02T21:29:36  <michelled> colinclark: is there anything more, or just that thread?
2020-03-02T21:29:58  <colinclark> yup, just those three news articles
2020-03-02T21:30:45  <colinclark> nice little micro news posts
2020-03-02T21:30:48  <greatislander> cool!
2020-03-02T21:30:51  <colinclark> one sentence each with a link
2020-03-02T21:30:56  <colinclark> in one case, unfortunately, it’s a PDF
2020-03-02T21:31:01  <colinclark> is that hard to somehow provide?
2020-03-02T21:31:23  <colinclark> Tomorrow during our technical meeting, can we do a little debrief about what happened...
2020-03-02T21:31:36  <colinclark> and then to set up some roles and responsibilities for the sites (old and new)?
2020-03-02T21:31:55  <colinclark> (none of which will involve pinging you in a panic, greatislander) :) :)
2020-03-02T21:32:05  <greatislander> :)
2020-03-02T21:32:08  <greatislander> sounds good
2020-03-02T21:32:24  <colinclark> I’d like Teddy___ to take over the news and site updates, and we’ll talk about next steps for the development effort
2020-03-02T21:32:30  <colinclark> fortunately with a bigger team :)
2020-03-02T21:34:21  <Teddy___> looking forward to the meeting tomorrow
2020-03-02T21:39:32  <greatislander> colinclark just to clarify, should the Google Doc and PDF be linked separately or in one post?
2020-03-02T21:39:48  <colinclark> I think she was asking for separate posts
2020-03-02T21:39:51  <greatislander> okay
2020-03-02T21:39:56  <colinclark> let me rereaad just to double check
2020-03-02T21:40:56  <colinclark> maybe this is just one post?
2020-03-02T21:41:07  <colinclark> i’m confused now—shall i double check with Jutta?
2020-03-02T21:43:31  <colinclark> greatislander: “You could separate the two reports and put the twitter summary and link to the full report with the second one.”
2020-03-02T21:43:40  <greatislander> Okay makes sense
2020-03-02T21:43:47  <colinclark> yeah, seems reasonable
2020-03-02T21:43:54  <colinclark> thank you SO much again for this

2020-03-02T22:08:50  <greatislander> yeah
2020-03-02T22:08:59  <greatislander> preview images really need to be kind of art directed
