2020-06-04T20:46:14  <greatislander> danayo— just to clarify, I notice that First and Last Name are not marked as required, and neither are languages you speak— is that an oversight, or you just didn't mark them because they were already required?
2020-06-04T20:47:03  <danayo> oversight greatislander !
2020-06-04T20:47:04  <greatislander> Also for now this text is being used as help text for multiple selects. I may be able to replace them with a better option but wanted to run it by you anyway
2020-06-04T20:47:05  <danayo> sorry
