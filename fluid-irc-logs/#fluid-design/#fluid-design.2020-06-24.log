2020-06-24T15:05:06  <greatislander> cherylhjli: are you available to go over your review comments?
2020-06-24T15:06:10  <cherylhjli> yep
2020-06-24T15:28:10  <greatislander> cherylhjli: ready for another look
2020-06-24T15:28:45  <jhung> danayo cherylhjli greatislander if you both have time, I'd like to show you where I'm at with community voices.
2020-06-24T15:28:57  <greatislander> sure, right after standup jhung?
2020-06-24T15:29:07  <greatislander> I am also going to take a look at that checkbox issue in Pinecone
2020-06-24T15:29:46  <jhung> greatislander sure.
2020-06-24T15:31:27  <cherylhjli> greatislander - the changes look great
2020-06-24T15:31:42  <cherylhjli> I just noticed that the border below challenges is a bit tight with the text
2020-06-24T15:31:46  <cherylhjli> can we add some padding there?
2020-06-24T15:37:22  <greatislander> fixed now cherylhjli
2020-06-24T15:38:05  <greatislander> please approve if there are no other adjustments needed :)
2020-06-24T15:57:23  <gtirloni> gmoss: re: SJRK-367 -- Do you know where I could add the Matomo code so it's added to the <head> of every page? I think I'd need to do that on a per-theme basis (actually, per website basis, so if they reuse the theme.. that would be a problem) and I'm having some trouble understanding where it would go
2020-06-24T16:05:06  <greatislander> jhung: https://github.com/jhung/pinecone/pull/1
2020-06-24T16:06:08  <greatislander> co-op check in?
2020-06-24T16:06:14  <danayo> sure
2020-06-24T16:06:22  <cherylhjli> yep
2020-06-24T16:06:44  <gmoss> gtirloni: there isn't (yet) a single layout template, so it would have to be on each html file (there are 3 for base theme and some themes have one or two additional pages). Would the code need to differ from domain to domain? I know that's how it would work in Google Analytics land, assuming a similar setup for Matomo
2020-06-24T16:07:09  <gtirloni> gmoss: yeah, it'd differ for each domain/website
2020-06-24T16:07:19  <gmoss> gtirloni: that complicates things a little...
2020-06-24T16:08:13  <gmoss> let me think on this for a bit. there might be a way to do this for each theme specifically without introducing duplication
2020-06-24T16:08:19  <gtirloni> we can have a single code for all deployments, maybe in the base theme. but then the numbers would be aggreated
2020-06-24T16:08:35  <gtirloni> cool, thanks! there's no rush and I'm not planning to work on it today/tomorrow anyway
2020-06-24T16:08:50  <gmoss> gtirloni: okay, I'll just let it roll around in my head for a day or two, in that case :)
2020-06-24T16:08:55  <gtirloni> awesome, thx
2020-06-24T16:14:41  <cherylhjli> jhung alanharnum are you folks joining us for coop checkin?
