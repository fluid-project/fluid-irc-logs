2019-09-05T13:28:05  <jhung> michelled, greatislander, cherylhjli - do we want to meet about JT's email once danayo comes online?
2019-09-05T13:28:40  <greatislander> Can we do so right after the SEWA call?

2019-09-05T13:33:11  <greatislander> I’m pretty flexible so that works
2019-09-05T13:33:32  <michelled> I'm going to respond on the list to the email
2019-09-05T13:40:52  <jhung> ok sounds good.

2019-09-05T15:09:57  <jhung> greatislander I'm looking at the data validation PR now.
2019-09-05T15:10:13  <greatislander> awesome
2019-09-05T15:10:17  <greatislander> thanks jhung
2019-09-05T15:16:27  <michelled> jhung, cherylhjli, danayo_, greatislander: please chime in on that thread if I missed anything
2019-09-05T15:22:17  <greatislander> michelled I think you covered it very well.

2019-09-05T16:20:39  <jhung> greatislander I have encountered some bugs with the date validation on the form. But otherwise the validation catches instances where there's no data in either field. I'm not sure how deep the validation is supposed to be and if it should be catching date format issues.
2019-09-05T16:24:38  <danayo_> greatislander: do you think it makes sense to include a point in the doc about how we want the resource library to have reusable “pieces” that might be used by our partners in building their context-dependent learning commons? do you think this is realistic/true of what we will build?
2019-09-05T16:24:41  <greatislander> It's only supposed to catch missing required fields at this point. It would be worth documenting/opening an issue for the date validation you noticed.
2019-09-05T16:24:52  <greatislander> jhung ^
2019-09-05T16:26:40  <greatislander> danayo_ I think it's worth noting that we are trying to build it in such a way that others might be able to repurpose it for their needs, yes
2019-09-05T16:31:29  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.103> has joined #fluid-design
2019-09-05T16:34:07  <jhung> greatislander ok will do.
2019-09-05T16:38:04  <cherylhjli> michelled - danayo_ and I were debating whether showing trebor the rough prototype we have of the resource library would help give him a sense of all the work involved, or whether that would be a can of worms. any thoughts on this? jhung greatislander any thoughts on this as well?
2019-09-05T16:38:27  <michelled> it's probably both :)
2019-09-05T16:38:43  <michelled> let's show it and just be vigilant about saying 'yes, these are things we are working on'
2019-09-05T16:39:03  <danayo_> cherylhjli: I wasn’t thinking of the protoypte ,actually, but the google draw doc
2019-09-05T16:39:40  <danayo_> which reflects all the work of the co-design chats and synthesis
2019-09-05T16:40:04  <cherylhjli> oh! apologies, danayo_
2019-09-05T16:40:17  <cherylhjli> yes, I think that would be more harmless to show for sure :)
2019-09-05T16:40:41  <danayo_> np
2019-09-05T16:42:00  <cherylhjli> in that case danayo_ I'm going to scrub all the names on the top of our doc to just "P1" "P2" etc
2019-09-05T16:42:14  <danayo_> cherylhjli: right, good idea
2019-09-05T16:43:52  <jhung> greatislander PR merged
2019-09-05T16:46:52  <greatislander> amazing thanks jhung

2019-09-05T17:21:50  <alanharnum> michelled: I'm just about done with the wecount WP setup (have had to take copious notes along the way, a lot of the process is still manual and not automated), I could try for 2:30 or tomorrow
2019-09-05T17:22:30  <michelled> I'm not working tomorrow. Any chance for 4:00 today?
2019-09-05T17:22:47  <michelled> I'm super glad you took notes!
2019-09-05T17:26:03  <alanharnum> michelled: I have an appointment at 3:30 but I should be back by 4:30? Or we can do Monday, or maybe write up our thoughts separately.

2019-09-05T17:27:12  <michelled> I'm not back until Wednesday - we can try 4:30 today
2019-09-05T17:27:28  <alanharnum> ok - sorry, this week has been totally eaten by various infra things :/
2019-09-05T17:27:48  <alanharnum> i'll email you if my appointment runs long
2019-09-05T17:31:12  <michelled> alanharnum: you aren't allowed to apologize for singlehandedly handling all our infrastructure on the side of all your project work!
2019-09-05T17:32:05  <michelled> and yeah, just keep in touch - it's not the end of the world if we get back to candidates late next week - I warned them during the interview that we'd be slow
