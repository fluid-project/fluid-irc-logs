This, combined with the task he's working on for 0.2.1 should keep him busy until Monday when simonjb is back at work

2020-02-20T20:26:15  <jhung> erictheise the closest thing to a bookmark in Zoom is the "Join" button. It will show a list of past rooms you've been in. You can pick the different meetings based on the room name.
2020-02-20T20:27:57  <erictheise> good approach jhung, thanks.

2020-02-20T20:29:39  <michelled> Caren_ and danayo are talking through your design questions on the tool and it would probably be good if you're able to join
