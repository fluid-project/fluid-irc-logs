2020-04-17T16:04:50  <gmoss> cindyli: I would hold off for now, I meant to merge in latest master after SJRK-289 to make sure nothing breaks
2020-04-17T16:05:07  <cindyli> good to know. thanks, gmoss
2020-04-17T16:05:08  <gmoss> we could always handle that the other way 'round, of course :)_
2020-04-17T16:06:30  <gmoss> cindyli: I don't foresee any conflicts, for what it's worth
2020-04-17T16:09:28  <cindyli> i agree either way should be fine.

2020-04-17T16:30:22  <gmoss> cindyli: are you good to meet for Storytelling check-in?
2020-04-17T16:30:36  <gmoss> looks like it's just us today (colinclark you're welcome to join, if you like!)
2020-04-17T16:31:08  <colinclark> I am in the midst of something at the moment
2020-04-17T16:31:16  <colinclark> but i’d love a status update before you hit the road for the weekend, gmoss
2020-04-17T16:32:38  <gmoss> colinclark: for sure. Cindy has started reviewing the SJRK-289 PR (https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/71), which I filed early so she could do so. It seems like getting files associated with media blocks (images, audio, video) to save and load is a little more complicated than I anticipated. Otherwise the functionality is there, just a few more tests to add
2020-04-17T16:33:14  <gmoss> I feel there's value to the autosave function even if it doesn't keep the files
2020-04-17T16:33:21  <gmoss> but I'm going to try to get it working today
2020-04-17T16:36:05  <gmoss> colinclark: I just realized you probably meant later :)
2020-04-17T16:37:05  <cindyli> gmoss: i'm good to meet for check in anytime. just let me know. thanks
2020-04-17T16:37:34  <gmoss> cindyli: let's meet now then
2020-04-17T16:37:42  <cindyli> ok
2020-04-17T16:37:51  <cindyli> standup room
2020-04-17T16:37:58  <gmoss> yep!
2020-04-17T16:38:15  <colinclark> ha, gmoss, that’s fine
2020-04-17T16:38:37  <colinclark> I think you can probably arrange to get files as Blobs, but the issue is going to be storying them locally, yes
2020-04-17T16:38:52  <colinclark> they’re likely too big for most of the typical browser restrictions on local storage
2020-04-17T16:38:59  *** sepidehshahi <sepidehshahi!~sepidehsh@CPEe0553d68e035-CM64777d56f120.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has quit IRC (Quit: sepidehshahi)
2020-04-17T17:03:09  <gmoss> colinclark: yeah the issue is persisting the blobs beyond the current session. they stick around on a page refresh, but once the window/tab is closed, they disappear. My current approach (as I was just telling Cindy) was to convert the blobs to base64 strings representing their data, but that inflates the file size by a factor of 5(!). I hadn't written the load code yet, but it may work.
2020-04-17T17:03:09  <gmoss> And yes, it seems you're correct about the size limits of localStorage. the MDN pages I'd read a couple of months ago suggested the limit was quite high, but that was the overall limit, and there are restrictions per origin (between 10MB and 2GB). I guess I'll have to think of another solution for those files
2020-04-17T17:03:59  <colinclark> can you not store a typed array in local data storage? Only strings?
2020-04-17T17:04:09  <colinclark> Last I heard, Safari’s limit was 25 MB
2020-04-17T17:04:29  <colinclark> It may be that we have to prioritize the content that people typically create inside the tool itself
2020-04-17T17:04:42  <colinclark> so the block structure, the text within blocks
2020-04-17T17:04:43  <gmoss> colinclark: localStorage is only strings, yeah
2020-04-17T17:04:49  <colinclark> and then if we do in-application recording of audio, that
2020-04-17T17:05:17  <colinclark> Blob to data URL is probably what you want
2020-04-17T17:05:22  <colinclark> but it’ll be big still
2020-04-17T17:06:12  <colinclark> do we record audio directly in the Storytelling interface? or only uploading of audio files?
2020-04-17T17:06:35  <gmoss> colinclark: only uploading so far, as far as the tool is concerned. there's no audio editing yet
2020-04-17T17:06:40  <colinclark> ok
2020-04-17T17:06:41  <colinclark> pictures/
2020-04-17T17:06:43  <colinclark> video?
2020-04-17T17:06:44  <gmoss> (SJRK-10, one of yours I believe :))
2020-04-17T17:06:45  <gmoss> same
2020-04-17T17:06:55  <colinclark> ok
2020-04-17T17:07:12  <colinclark> so if our main goal is to avoid users losing content they’ve created, we could afford to not persist files that they uploaded
2020-04-17T17:07:15  <gmoss> colinclark: those can all be captured on compatible devices, but they're still treated as regular files from the tool's perspective
2020-04-17T17:07:20  <colinclark> it would sort of suck
2020-04-17T17:07:21  <colinclark> ah right
2020-04-17T17:07:41  <colinclark> meaning if someone captures a photo on their mobile device, it will also end up in their photo collection?
2020-04-17T17:07:53  <colinclark> so that they would be able to upload it again later
2020-04-17T17:07:58  <gmoss> colinclark: that's what I've experienced, yep
2020-04-17T17:08:03  <gmoss> I can confirm
2020-04-17T17:08:27  <gmoss> it's possible iOS doesn't keep them around if they're captured
2020-04-17T17:08:59  <gmoss> I feel the autosave feature is still very helpful even if the files aren't recreated. empty blocks are persisted, so you keep any text content and structure you've created
2020-04-17T17:09:13  <gmoss> but it would be nice to get files in there too, of course
2020-04-17T17:10:36  <gmoss> (confirming on an iPad mini right now)

2020-04-17T17:13:57  <gmoss> colinclark: it seems iOS treats photos captured within the tool differently from those captured from the camera, so those would not be recoverable if they aren't saved with the story
2020-04-17T17:14:08  <gmoss> *from the camera = within the camera app
2020-04-17T17:16:06  <colinclark> bummer
2020-04-17T17:16:12  <gmoss> yeah :(
2020-04-17T17:16:25  <colinclark> It sounds like we need “true” autosave
2020-04-17T17:16:52  <colinclark> i.e. persistence on the server for unpublished drafts, as you go
2020-04-17T17:17:53  <gmoss> colinclark: indeed, it sounds like that's what we need for the functionality we intend to have. I had thought about that in the past and wondered about bandwidth and transfer cap on the user's end
2020-04-17T17:18:00  <gmoss> it comes with its own set of complications
2020-04-17T17:18:32  <gmoss> I'm going to give this some more thought..
2020-04-17T17:24:20  <gmoss> colinclark cindyli: For this upcoming release, maybe it would be best to exclude files from the autosave feature until we figure out a better way to store and retrieve them. I can git-revert the commit that adds file saving, clear media block URLs on load and just focus on tests for what's there already. what do you think?
2020-04-17T17:24:46  <colinclark> I think that’s probably a reasonable approach
2020-04-17T17:24:57  <colinclark> assuming what you’ve got in that commit for file saving doesn’t work yet
2020-04-17T17:25:11  <colinclark> I imagine the ideal short-term case might be to show a little message for all media we couldn’t save
2020-04-17T17:25:21  <colinclark> in the case that someone has navigated away and back and lost the files
2020-04-17T17:25:33  <colinclark> at least we could say sorry
2020-04-17T17:25:38  <gmoss> well it saves smaller things to the localStorage, but there isn't code to retrieve that yet. yeah a notice to the user would be good, I agree
2020-04-17T17:25:39  <colinclark> but Dana will need to think about that
2020-04-17T17:25:44  <colinclark> and saving something is better than nothing
2020-04-17T17:26:23  <gmoss> okay, I'll cut that part out for now. we can put it all back in again once we're ready
2020-04-17T17:31:55  <colinclark> bummer
