2019-09-23T13:41:06  <Justin_o> jhung: I was looking at Ulysses on the weekend. https://ulysses.app
2019-09-23T13:47:15  <Justin_o> It got me thinking about the Story Telling tool. One of the nice things about Ulysses is that it's not really concerned about content presentation as you write. You provide the content and can use a form of Markdown to provide the directives. Styling is applied at the export phase. So, thinking about the storytelling tool, maybe something more along those lines would improve the overall workflow. We could remove
2019-09-23T13:47:15  <Justin_o> the block concept, there by not having to worry about the block insertion issues we discussed at the community meeting.

2019-09-23T13:48:52  <Justin_o> the story telling tool isn't currently wysiwyg and neither is this suggestion, but I think it would help with the flow of writing. The caveat would be the need for entering and potentially viewing some markup. However, with good keyboard shortcuts and a toolbar for applying that markup, maybe it will be okay. Any thoughts?
2019-09-23T13:48:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: You may also have thoughts on this.

2019-09-23T15:11:51  <greatislander> Justin_o I'm very fond of Ulysses. I've been using it for a few years now.
2019-09-23T15:14:30  <Justin_o> greatislander: cool, I have a copy from before they switched to a subscription model, but haven't used it much. I'm not sure what the latests feature.
2019-09-23T15:15:34  <Justin_o> in practice do you mind waiting on export or preview to see how things will look?
2019-09-23T15:15:44  <greatislander> I have used it extensively for writing documentation‚Äî they added support in the last year or two for Markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting which is really nice for that use case.
2019-09-23T15:16:24  <greatislander> In practice, I find that I write much more fluidly without getting hung up on the design, so keeping that phase separate really helps my process.
2019-09-23T15:16:45  <greatislander> (I'm one of the people who is liable to get hung up on typographical choices as a form of procrastination‚Ä¶)
2019-09-23T15:17:10  <Justin_o> :)
2019-09-23T15:17:23  <Justin_o> that's an interesting point though
2019-09-23T15:17:34  <Justin_o> I guess that really is a bit of potential distraction
2019-09-23T15:18:00  <greatislander> Yeah, generally once I have a draft I preview it and see if I need to tweak anything to make it flow better in the real design
2019-09-23T15:18:57  <greatislander> For the most part over the last few years that's mainly been making sure all the headings scan well once it's rendered to HTML with GitHub's stylesheet but I used to use it for papers in my BFA as well and I found it was really helpful for that in terms of setting word count goals.
2019-09-23T15:20:41  <Justin_o> greatislander: and were you able to tweek things just in the content, or did you have to create/modify the output engine
2019-09-23T15:21:18  <greatislander> I only ever really tweaked in content. I think the themes are not overly difficult to modify, though‚Äîthat said I have never tried.
2019-09-23T15:23:32  <Justin_o> greatislander: okay, I was just thinking the story telling tool doesn't really provide a means of affecting the styling. Other than content entry..so was curious how often you tried something like that in your experience.
2019-09-23T15:23:40  <greatislander> Yep
2019-09-23T15:24:00  <Justin_o> greatislander: by the way, when would be a good time for you to chat about BEM?
2019-09-23T15:24:31  <greatislander> My day is pretty open after the co-op check in which usually runs 11:45-12 or 12:15 Eastern, so let me know what works for you!
2019-09-23T15:25:29  <Justin_o> greatislander: I'm pretty much open today too.. lets say 12:15 Eastern?

2019-09-23T19:50:47  <gmoss> Justin_o: I just read your discussion about Ulysses and the possibility of adding styling/markup/markdown to the Storytelling Tool. I think the way the ST is, with content entry being literally content only, was a deliberate choice, though I'm open to discussing other options. I think it would be a great topic for a another design crit. jhung what do you think?
2019-09-23T19:52:44  <gmoss> I think I mentioned at the crit last week that there was one individual who was unsure about how his content would appear once it was rendered. I let him know about the preview capability before publishing, but he didn't know the whole creation-metadata-preview-publish workflow. there are perhaps other ways to address that issue that are less drastic, like using tabs or a small menu to switch between the editor's
