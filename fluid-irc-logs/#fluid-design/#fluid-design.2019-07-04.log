2019-07-04T13:34:51  <michelled> simonjb: this is the presentation about git that justino put together years ago: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/GIT+Tips+and+Tricks?preview=/23562089/23691384/gitPrimer.pdf
2019-07-04T13:35:47  <michelled> I'm thinking that it goes nicely with the diagrams you've been making
2019-07-04T13:37:32  <michelled> although I realize that it assumes you'll use the command line for working and I think that's not the best for people who are used to command line interfaces

2019-07-04T13:38:03  <michelled> np
2019-07-04T13:50:44  <michelled> jhung: what did you decide about this page? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/git+and+github+for+Designers
2019-07-04T13:52:22  <simonjb> michelled: it's really interesting to see the names that are used for the thing I'm currently calling "Commits & Refs". in the diagram on page 18 of Justin's presentation it's called "local repository" which I don't think is accurate. the git book defines a "bare repository" as "a repository that doesn’t contain a working directory". so I think it's reasonable to describe the working
2019-07-04T13:52:22  <simonjb> directory as part of the repository. but the git book also used "git directory (repository)" in its introduction. which also isn't accurate as the index is in the git directory. I guess there's no good standard name?
2019-07-04T13:53:51  <michelled> interesting, I'm not sure

2019-07-04T14:08:59  <simonjb> michelled: I use the git command line sometimes but mostly I use a GUI now instead
2019-07-04T14:09:28  <simonjb> (with reference to your comment above regarding command line)
2019-07-04T14:09:36  <michelled> ah, I always use the command line - I guess because I have a lot of muscle memory for it

2019-07-04T14:15:05  <simonjb> michelled: there are definitely things I find easier/clearer on the command line but for the more common things like seeing diffs of working directory and index, staging, commiting, pushing, pulling/fetching, I really like a GUI
2019-07-04T14:15:30  <simonjb> and seeing repo history
2019-07-04T14:15:46  <simonjb> and where branches are at
2019-07-04T14:16:13  <simonjb> it's really nice to have a visual graph
2019-07-04T14:16:21  <michelled> that's true

2019-07-04T17:04:12  <cherylhjli> danayo_ - do we want to make some time to talk about the design crit? (you're off tomorrow, right?)
2019-07-04T17:07:49  <danayo_> cherylhjli: why don’t we check in about it on Monday cherylhjli ? I think it will make more sense to spend some more time on the sketching first
