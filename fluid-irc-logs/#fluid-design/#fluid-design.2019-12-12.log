2019-12-12T15:33:02  <danielcho> Justin_o: Hey Justin, have you ever write test cases for auto scrolling? I am using Element.scrollIntoView() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView

2019-12-12T15:34:50  <danielcho> thanks colinclark :)
2019-12-12T15:35:25  <colinclark> Is there a PR where I can share some feedback?
2019-12-12T15:35:54  <danielcho> I think I didn't submit a pull request for that one yet, I will create one now
2019-12-12T15:36:09  <colinclark> thanks!
2019-12-12T15:37:19  <danielcho> colinclark: https://github.com/codelearncreate/c2lc-coding-environment/pull/23 thanks for reviewing it!
2019-12-12T15:39:48  <Justin_o> danielcho: hello, what is the issue you are running into with writing the unit tests?
2019-12-12T15:41:02  <danielcho> Justin_o: oh, I haven't written one yet, but I was wondering what can test for such case, I need an advice on how should I start it
2019-12-12T15:42:00  <danielcho> auto scrolling involves changes in DOM element, and not sure how I can simulate that
2019-12-12T15:44:41  <Justin_o> danielcho: I guess you can put the items to scroll inside of a scrolling element, so that you aren't relying on the scrolling of the entire page.
2019-12-12T15:45:18  <Justin_o> And then you can probably test that the position relative to the parent is where you expect it to be
2019-12-12T15:45:48  <Justin_o> danielcho: does that seem doable for your use case?
2019-12-12T15:48:03  <danielcho> I think that can be one, I guess it really depends on the use case for the auto scrolling, but I think that's a good starting point
2019-12-12T15:48:23  <danielcho> Justin_o: thanks for the advice
2019-12-12T15:49:06  <Justin_o> danielcho: okay,  hope it works. let me know if you have any other questions. Also if you really do need to test the whole page, you can try stuffing it in an iframe
2019-12-12T15:52:48  <danielcho> Justin_o: when I think about it, testing for whole page is not required, but if I need to test the whole page, I will ask you about how to use iframe for testing :)
2019-12-12T15:53:17  <Justin_o> sounds good
2019-12-12T16:03:41  <colinclark> danielcho: I made some comments, hopefully they seem reasonable to you
2019-12-12T16:04:00  <danielcho> thanks colinclark, I will check them now
2019-12-12T16:08:10  <danielcho> colinclark: I don't see any comments on the PR, where did you make the comments?
2019-12-12T16:10:20  <colinclark> oh shoot
2019-12-12T16:10:23  <colinclark> i didn’t press the finish button :)
