2020-09-18T15:44:41  <alanharnum> oh this is an interesting controller concept: https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/09/15/magpie-midi-is-an-adaptive-harmonica-style-computer-interface/ - harmonica-inspired sip-and-puff controller
2020-09-18T15:59:23  <gmoss> alanharnum: this is so thoroughly cool. signal boosting for sure
2020-09-18T16:07:03  <colinclark> oh cool, alanharnum
2020-09-18T16:12:58  <danielcho> yeah, very interesting :)
2020-09-18T16:35:24  <the-t-in-rtf> Very interesting, @alanharnum
2020-09-18T16:36:13  <the-t-in-rtf> Just watching the video and preso.
2020-09-18T16:36:38  <the-t-in-rtf> Making the base a directional input is pretty brilliant.
2020-09-18T16:37:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I was remembering @philip and others commenting on our gamepad work and thinking about chording
2020-09-18T16:37:29  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: the bit where they discuss using it as a game input made me think of the work dmahajan980 and you did on the Gamepad Navigator
2020-09-18T16:37:40  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, there's a lot of overlap
2020-09-18T16:38:32  <the-t-in-rtf> But I was thinking a lot about (fairly expensive) MIDI wind instruments, where there's one breath input and the fingers "chord" with that to make a note.
2020-09-18T16:38:57  <the-t-in-rtf> The sweet spot for me would be what they're describing with maybe 2-4 pluggable inputs.
2020-09-18T16:39:13  <the-t-in-rtf> so you have 26 inputs with their scheme, but you multiply that with every switch
2020-09-18T16:39:38  <the-t-in-rtf> so your total inputs are breath inputs times non-breath
2020-09-18T16:40:03  <the-t-in-rtf> (of course in their case it's already more complicated because of the joystick functionality)
2020-09-18T16:40:35  <the-t-in-rtf> So, for example, I was thinking of a three pedal arrangement for piano
2020-09-18T16:41:05  <the-t-in-rtf> for music you could do things like shift the octave range up or down
2020-09-18T16:41:16  <the-t-in-rtf> and perhaps toggle sustain when both are hit at the same time
2020-09-18T16:41:50  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: it would be even cooler if this device had velocity sensitivity on the sip/puff, even more potential for such combinations
2020-09-18T16:42:05  <the-t-in-rtf> if you have three pedals like some units, you can map two octaves down to the far left, one octave down to the middle and left at the same time
2020-09-18T16:42:13  <the-t-in-rtf> I didn't realize it didn't
2020-09-18T16:42:19  <the-t-in-rtf> that's half the point of wind instruments, IMO
2020-09-18T16:42:27  <the-t-in-rtf> the expressiveness of breath
2020-09-18T16:42:42  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: maybe it does have it, I don't recall them mentioning it
2020-09-18T16:42:58  <the-t-in-rtf> so you'd put the chording stuff on insensitive parameters like octave or sustain
2020-09-18T16:43:10  <the-t-in-rtf> and use the breath inputs for more expressive stuff like note velocity
2020-09-18T16:43:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I was also thinking about tibetan throat singing
2020-09-18T16:43:30  <the-t-in-rtf> like, the inhale could be an octave higher.
2020-09-18T16:43:58  <the-t-in-rtf> the inhaled notes tend to sound higher
2020-09-18T16:44:14  <the-t-in-rtf> although skilled performers can balance to sustain a note across both
2020-09-18T16:44:58  <the-t-in-rtf> I just had the thought of making inhaled toggle switches and making exhale momentary
2020-09-18T16:45:11  <the-t-in-rtf> so you could set a backing chord with inhales and then play along with it with exhales
2020-09-18T16:45:53  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I hope they sell a kit at some point, obviously I'm interested enough to give it a try
2020-09-18T16:56:17  <the-t-in-rtf> Another thought, if it could somehow monitor for pitch, then it becomes a whole other instrument
2020-09-18T16:56:42  <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess it's probably pressure switches
2020-09-18T16:57:25  <the-t-in-rtf> but just think of how much you could do with pitch and velocity times 26
2020-09-18T16:58:28  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: looks like this is the sensor they're using, it seems like velocity sensitivity is a possibility, though I'm unsure if they have coded for that: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Atmospheric-pressure-sensor-MPS-2407-015AD-/254553301354
2020-09-18T16:58:49  <gmoss> but yeah even if it's the standard 128 velocity values * 26
2020-09-18T16:58:55  <the-t-in-rtf> very interesting.
2020-09-18T16:59:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess it's mapping the complexity to something natural that is interesting to me.
2020-09-18T16:59:38  <the-t-in-rtf> like I was wondering about a button to simulate holding your hand over the back of a harmonica.
2020-09-18T16:59:46  <the-t-in-rtf> the kind of thing that generations of performers have made us of
2020-09-18T17:00:26  <the-t-in-rtf> use
2020-09-18T17:01:25  <gmoss> Very neat idea :D
2020-09-18T17:01:31  <the-t-in-rtf> so, like a three pedal/buttton setup where one dampens the sound and two affect the octave range
2020-09-18T17:03:30  <the-t-in-rtf> and maybe the side switches are a kind of navigation
2020-09-18T17:03:34  <the-t-in-rtf> octave up and down
2020-09-18T17:03:59  <the-t-in-rtf> it doesn't take a lot of controls to really open up possibilities
2020-09-18T17:34:16  <cindyli> hi Uttara, thanks for sending out the email of data monitor updates. it seems you forgot to include the figma link in it
2020-09-18T17:34:54  <Uttara> cindyli: Oops! thanks for noticing it! I will resend it!
2020-09-18T17:36:15  <cindyli> thanks, Uttara.
2020-09-18T17:59:28  <cindyli> Teddy___: can you review my pull request when you have time - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/404? thanks
2020-09-18T18:16:16  <Teddy___> cindyli: yeah currently working on it
2020-09-18T18:18:23  <cindyli> thanks, Teddy___
