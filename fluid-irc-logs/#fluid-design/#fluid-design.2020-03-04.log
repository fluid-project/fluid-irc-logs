2020-03-04T15:16:27  <sepidehshahi> do you need the little nodes with plus icon?
2020-03-04T15:17:02  <sepidehshahi> and for the controls, do you need different states e.g. selected, hover, disabled?
2020-03-04T15:17:17  <danielcho> I was able to reuse the plus icon we were using before for those nodes, so I think ones you mentioned are good :)
2020-03-04T15:18:11  <danielcho> we were handling different states with css, so I don't think so

2020-03-04T15:58:08  <greatislander> erictheise I believe that's been fixed in the dev branch

2020-03-04T16:39:48  <erictheise> cherylhjli danayo I'm going to need social media icons and wonder if those are on the roadmap for pinecone. "social" should include github, maybe bitbucket, as well as the usual suspects (linkedin, twitter, facebook, instagram … not sure how longtail we'd want to go).

2020-03-04T16:48:11  <greatislander> Thanks! It hasn't been discussed that I'm aware of but definitely makes sense. I can probably grab them from https://forkaweso.me/Fork-Awesome/

2020-03-04T17:57:55  <greatislander> I think it's been addressed in recent versions but if you are seeing this in dev please open a ticket erictheise
2020-03-04T17:58:20  <erictheise> greatislander, sorry if I've asked before but are there alignment classes in pinecone or is that separate styling, e.g,, our "View full profile" links are right justified.
2020-03-04T17:58:52  <erictheise> the 404s I'm seeing in current master but will pull dev and see how it goes. it's just an fyi, not any blocker for me.
2020-03-04T17:59:30  <greatislander> there is an align-right utility class which was recently added in dev: https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/pinecone/blob/56978165b5191e93c32088619a1c4ce381329f92/src/assets/styles/common/_global.scss#L92

2020-03-04T20:48:02  <AghaSaad> Hello everyone, This is Agha Saad Fraz, pursuing Software Engineering. I am interested in applying to Inclusive Design Institute for GSoC'20. I have seen all the interesting ideas. The idea that has attracted me the most is "Migrate FLOE and Fluid project websites to Hugo Static Site Generator". I have been using HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery in my
2020-03-04T20:48:03  <AghaSaad> projects for more than a year. I am very interested to work and contribute to Inclusive Design Institute. Kindly guide me on how to start? Thanks

2020-03-04T21:13:38  <gmoss> welcome, AghaSaad! I'm one of the mentors on that project. A great starting point would be to familiarize yourself with the two sites we plan to convert to Hugo. The Wiki page for our GSoC projects has a "How to get started" section for each project as well as links to the repositories.
2020-03-04T21:14:07  <gmoss> AghaSaad: we also try to keep development-related discussions in the #fluid-work channel, so please feel free to reply to me there :)
2020-03-04T21:15:03  <AghaSaad> Perfect. Thank you gmoss. I will look into the wiki page and will surely contact if I face any issue. :)
