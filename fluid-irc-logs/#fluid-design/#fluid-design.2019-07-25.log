2019-07-25T14:09:02  <jhung> greatislander - some other fields I thought of we may want to track: coop affiliation, and locale? I recall this being something that has come up in conversations.
2019-07-25T14:09:26  <greatislander> yes!
2019-07-25T14:09:35  <greatislander> Also available translations and language
2019-07-25T14:10:06  <jhung> and each of those translations will need a different URL. So probably another key-value pair.
2019-07-25T14:11:30  <greatislander> yep
2019-07-25T14:11:43  <greatislander> We need to assess how Polylang would handle that, actually

2019-07-25T14:27:28  <danayo_> thanks for joining the meeting cherylhjli, jhung, greatislander - I was hoping we’d be able to look at something today and discuss in more detail, but there you go

2019-07-25T15:53:07  <greatislander> My vidyo room?
2019-07-25T15:54:11  <danayo_> sure
2019-07-25T16:17:25  <jhung> Sorry greatislander and danayo_ I was afk.
2019-07-25T16:17:29  <jhung> Still meeting?
2019-07-25T16:18:10  <greatislander> I just caught up danayo_ on our chat this morning jhung
2019-07-25T16:18:28  <jhung> ok great greatislander - sorry I missed the meeting.
2019-07-25T16:18:47  <greatislander> Also we talked about user profile-based features and possibility of orienting the first launch of the Learning Commons around anonymous use, with creating a profile coming in the next iteration
2019-07-25T16:18:56  <greatislander> To discuss further
2019-07-25T16:19:01  <greatislander> no worries!

2019-07-25T17:19:11  <jhung> greatislander I was wondering - why are citations something we're tracking on the Learning Commons?
2019-07-25T17:19:54  <greatislander> They don’t need to be!
2019-07-25T17:23:50  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@lan2.penham.iasl.com> has quit IRC (Quit: colinclark)
2019-07-25T17:30:50  <jhung> Ah ok. After talking this morning, it didn't occur to me to ask the purpose of citations, since the resource itself would probably track it?
2019-07-25T17:31:15  <jhung> The only reason I see to track it is if there's a reason to be able to search by citation... which seems like an edge case?

2019-07-25T17:38:54  <greatislander> I was going by the TASCHA publication link I'd shared— which provided a ready-made citation for researchers. As we discussed, that's not necessarily data we would need to track; it could be generated from the other data (author, publisher, etc)
2019-07-25T17:40:31  <jhung> Ok great. Thanks for clarifying. I thought it was a req. :)
2019-07-25T17:47:16  <greatislander> nope!
2019-07-25T17:50:21  <jhung> cherylhjli, danayo_ - do you expect to have thumbnails for resources on the Learning Commons?
2019-07-25T17:51:09  <danayo_> possibly jhung - or something more like cards
2019-07-25T17:51:18  <cherylhjli> jhung yeah maybe something like a card? where there's pieces of info like name of resource, who posted it, when its been posted, some associated tags (topics/goals), maybe a short description… is that what you meant by a thumbnail?
2019-07-25T17:51:28  <cherylhjli> lol yeah what danayo_ said :)
2019-07-25T17:52:35  <jhung> cherylhjli, danayo_ - more like a visual representation of the actual resource. Either a screen capture, image from the resource, or something else.
2019-07-25T17:53:14  <cherylhjli> oh! hmm, I'm not sure jhung, since my assumption is most resources may not have a good image to be associated with it
2019-07-25T17:53:25  <cherylhjli> ex. an academic article or a wiki page
2019-07-25T17:53:40  <cherylhjli> so I'm tempted to say no… what do you think dananyo_?
2019-07-25T17:53:44  <cherylhjli> danayo_*
2019-07-25T17:54:09  *** Kendraf1 <Kendraf1!~Adium@205.211.168.105> has joined #fluid-design
2019-07-25T17:55:55  <danayo_> cherylhjli, jhung -  I suppose if there is an associated image (like for a video) we could use that, but otherwise, might need some kind of placeholder?
2019-07-25T17:56:24  <cherylhjli> can we have certain cards have images, and others not to have images? perhaps only videos have images and articles don't, or something like that
2019-07-25T17:57:40  <jhung> cherylhjli, danayo_ - that's possible. I can investigate. It's also possible to generate a random SVG thumbnail for resources that don't have a good thumbnail.
2019-07-25T17:58:21  <cherylhjli> is there a big implication on loading time for having images, jhung?
2019-07-25T17:59:24  <jhung> Good question cherylhjli - it will definitely add to the load time. Probably more noticeable on low-bandwidth situations.
2019-07-25T18:00:59  <jhung> Also depends on how many items we're displaying at a time.

2019-07-25T18:37:45  <jhung> cherylhjli, danayo_ re: thumbnails - so basically what I'm hearing is that there's currently no design need for thumbnails. It was on my todo to investigate for the backend, but I will shelve it until it becomes a desired feature.
