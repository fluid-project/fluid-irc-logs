2020-06-23T15:16:18  <gtirloni> i-0023: Installed Docker CE and Rancher.io admin panel
2020-06-23T18:50:57  <gtirloni> legacy website: Removed some top-level redirects (to the new website) so people can still navigate the content
2020-06-23T19:54:19  <colinclark> gtirloni: interesting
2020-06-23T19:54:31  <colinclark> out of curiosity, which content from the old site was it?
2020-06-23T19:54:47  <colinclark> and how did you hear about them needing it?
2020-06-23T19:59:26  <gtirloni> colinclark: jutta mentioned it in today's call. when someone clicks on 'About', they get redirects to the new website immediately... but there are subtopics below it and they became inacessible
2020-06-23T20:13:31  <colinclark> ah,  interesting
2020-06-23T20:13:47  <colinclark> well, thanks for doing that :)
