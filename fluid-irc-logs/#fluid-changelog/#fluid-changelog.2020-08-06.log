2020-08-06T17:37:49  <clown> gtirloni:  FWIW, jan.idrc.ocadu.ca was Jan Richards personal IDRC site.  He now works with metrolinx, and I might have an email for him.  Should I try and find it?
2020-08-06T17:38:36  <gtirloni> clown: if you hav it, that'd be great. I can notify him he's website is at https://github.com/inclusive-design/archived-sites/tree/master/jan.idrc.ocadu.ca now
2020-08-06T17:39:10  <gtirloni> is he still associated with the IDRC at any capacity?
2020-08-06T17:39:22  <gtirloni> his website mentioned the ATRC O_o
2020-08-06T17:42:49  <clown> I don't think he has an official relationship, but he came to the 25th anniversary in 2018.  And, he drops by every once in a while (when the offices were open).
