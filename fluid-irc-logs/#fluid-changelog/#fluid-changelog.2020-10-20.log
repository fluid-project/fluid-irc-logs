2020-10-20T18:31:31  <colinclark> thank you for your hard work, gtirloni :)
2020-10-20T18:31:33  <colinclark> updating everything
2020-10-20T18:31:40  <gtirloni> :D
2020-10-20T18:31:42  <gtirloni> np
2020-10-20T18:33:59  <colinclark> gtirloni: I was thinking...
2020-10-20T18:34:22  <colinclark> it looks like weâ€™re going to have to basically apply for a grant from MS now, in order ot access the in-kind they had committed to We Count
2020-10-20T18:34:27  <colinclark> which is sort of funny
2020-10-20T18:34:37  <gtirloni> yeah, that was my impression as well
2020-10-20T18:34:41  <colinclark> but there is still that Research Credits program, right?
2020-10-20T18:35:09  <colinclark> I am now adjunct faculty, so if it would help we could just apply for some research credits to get started with moving our infrastructure
2020-10-20T18:35:23  <colinclark> and then if we need more, we can apply for Jutta too :)
2020-10-20T18:36:27  <gtirloni> yeah, theoretically they would grant us a "subscription" in Azure and, theoretically, we can move resources between subscriptions pretty easily without disruption... so I think that would work!
2020-10-20T18:36:49  <gtirloni> (an organization can have multiple subscriptions, it's a M:N thing)
2020-10-20T18:37:12  <colinclark> ah ok
2020-10-20T18:37:25  <colinclark> let me know if we get to the point where you want me to fill out a form :)
2020-10-20T18:38:19  <gtirloni> I'll have to revisit that page about the research credits and try to make a sense of it.. and will bug you for sure, thanks :D
