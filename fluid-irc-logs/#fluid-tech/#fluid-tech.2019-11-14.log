2019-11-14T16:01:50  <cindyli> errors are too long and rejected by irc
2019-11-14T16:02:01  <cindyli> one error example is:
2019-11-14T16:02:03  <cindyli> [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) (favicon.ico, line 0)
2019-11-14T16:04:23  <cindyli> all errors are complaining about missing message bundles although messages are showing fine. the browser was trying to load message bundles from wrong directory such as http://localhost:8081/messages/storyMessages.json
2019-11-14T16:05:18  <cindyli> this happens with stories-floe-dev and of course your branches too. is this a known issue? I cannot find a JIRA for it
2019-11-14T16:06:41  <cindyli> if there isn't one for it, i will create one

2019-11-14T16:14:14  <gmoss> cindyli: there will be a certain amount of error messages generated while the resource loader is going through its fallback rules to load the correct localization
2019-11-14T16:14:30  <gmoss> But that seems like more than usual. Normally, uio won't generate those
2019-11-14T16:14:53  <gmoss> I can look into it later on (I'm not feeling super great at the moment)
2019-11-14T16:18:54  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss, i will create a jira so it doesn't go off our radar. don't worry, take care
2019-11-14T16:26:38  <cindyli> gmoss: i looked a bit more into the call stack. you are right that they are reported from the resource load fallback rules. I won't create a jira
