2019-10-08T15:14:32  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: we probably should consider to load "solution-schema-codex.json" into a more generic place for it to be shared across GPII modules.
2019-10-08T15:18:14  <cindyli> btw, "solution-schema-codex.json" still contains schemas both common terms and app terms. the difference is for the app terms, the new one uses the proper url such as "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.freedomscientific.jaws" while the old one simply use "com.freedomscientific.jaws"
2019-10-08T15:18:53  <cindyli> it seems i can read it for getting all schemas rather than reading it and flat.json5
2019-10-08T15:19:07  <cindyli> that's great

2019-10-08T18:59:09  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, it's built on postinstall by universal, so it's available to anything that uses universal.
2019-10-08T18:59:21  <the-t-in-rtf> If you can think of anything, well, more universal, I'm all ears.
2019-10-08T18:59:52  <the-t-in-rtf> Glad you like the format, I wanted it to directly match the keys used in prefs/settings payloads.
2019-10-08T19:02:44  <cindyli> it's very useful, thanks, the-t-in-rtf. in terms of being more universal, I was thinking to load it once like how  flat.json is loaded into ontologyMetadata.flat and all other modules can refer to it. Having different modules load it separately will create many copies of the data. of course, since there are only 2 modules using it right now, this may not be a big issue at the moment
2019-10-08T19:03:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I think that's a fair idea, having one component that houses the codex in memory.
2019-10-08T19:03:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I did something smaller scale or similar in the upcoming pull to reduce the memory footprint per request
2019-10-08T19:04:03  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. moved the solutions registry data to the parent middleware rather than the request handler.
2019-10-08T19:04:53  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll consider it as I work to make whatever assembles the next codex out of the smaller bits of data in the Live Solutions Registry.
2019-10-08T19:05:40  <cindyli> cool. thanks, the-t-in-rtf
