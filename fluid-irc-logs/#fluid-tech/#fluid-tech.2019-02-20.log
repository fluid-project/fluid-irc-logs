2019-02-20T16:04:01  <simonjb> colinclark: what license do you think would be best for the C2LC work I'm doing?
2019-02-20T16:04:09  <colinclark> Good question
2019-02-20T16:04:17  <simonjb> this is the repo: https://github.com/simonbates/c2lc-exploratory
2019-02-20T16:04:24  <colinclark> cooool
2019-02-20T16:04:32  <colinclark> I think generally we suggest 3-BSD for new projects
2019-02-20T16:04:39  <simonjb> cool
2019-02-20T16:04:50  <colinclark> I don't have any particular preference between it, MIT, and Apache at this point
2019-02-20T16:05:12  <colinclark> 3-BSD is a really simple license
2019-02-20T16:05:16  <simonjb> yes
2019-02-20T16:05:20  <colinclark> can be used by people who love the GPL, too
2019-02-20T16:05:42  <colinclark> so it's pretty universally compatible, just with the exception that it doesn't have quite the same level of patent protection as Apache
2019-02-20T16:05:51  <simonjb> yeah
2019-02-20T16:08:06  <simonjb> colinclark: would the story telling tool provide a good model to copy? https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/blob/learning-to-learn/LICENSE.txt
2019-02-20T16:08:10  <colinclark> there's templates here if you need them, simonjb https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Licensing
2019-02-20T16:08:37  <simonjb> thanks
2019-02-20T16:09:08  <simonjb> I'll use this template you linked
2019-02-20T16:09:15  <colinclark> It seems we don't have a little template for the embedded license that is suitable for modern project, but all you'd have to do is simplify this a bit: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Embedded+Infusion+license
2019-02-20T16:09:25  <colinclark> by simply removing reference to ECL
2019-02-20T16:10:33  <simonjb> theres a sample source code header for BSD at the bottom of the first page you linked
2019-02-20T16:10:41  <colinclark> oh perfect
2019-02-20T16:10:44  <colinclark> sorry, i missed that
2019-02-20T16:10:47  <simonjb> np!
2019-02-20T16:11:18  <simonjb> do you have thoughts on the repo name? I called it c2lc-exploratory for now
2019-02-20T16:11:25  <colinclark> seems fine to me
2019-02-20T16:11:29  <simonjb> cool
2019-02-20T16:11:44  <colinclark> once we have a thing, we can think of names for the thing
2019-02-20T16:11:50  <simonjb> yes
2019-02-20T16:12:30  <simonjb> colinclark: thanks, I'll put the licensing in place now
2019-02-20T16:12:37  <colinclark> simonjb: Just in terms of boilerplatey things, in new projects I've stopped with stuff like wrapping my files in an IIFE
2019-02-20T16:12:50  <colinclark> I guess this is something debatable, but I think these days it just isn't really needed
2019-02-20T16:13:36  <colinclark> Here's a file from Bubbles as an example just in case you're curious: https://github.com/colinbdclark/bubbles/blob/master/src/renderer-process/js/bubbles-composition.js
2019-02-20T16:13:58  <simonjb> ok, great
2019-02-20T16:14:07  <colinclark> Not that I'm saying you should follow this convention
2019-02-20T16:14:13  <colinclark> it just occurred to me as I was reading
2019-02-20T16:14:18  <colinclark> less indenting is nice :)
2019-02-20T16:14:59  <simonjb> yes, agreed
2019-02-20T16:15:01  <simonjb> I'll need some preamble as I want it to run in node also
2019-02-20T16:15:55  <simonjb> (I like running tests on the command line)
2019-02-20T16:16:41  <colinclark> ah yes, understandably
2019-02-20T16:19:49  <simonjb> right now the tests only run under node, but I'll set up a browser test runner also
