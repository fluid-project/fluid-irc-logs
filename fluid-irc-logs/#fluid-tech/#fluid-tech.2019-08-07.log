2019-08-07T14:38:55  <colinclark> hey the-t-in-rtf
2019-08-07T14:38:57  <colinclark> how’s it?
2019-08-07T14:39:56  <the-t-in-rtf> good
2019-08-07T14:45:03  <colinclark> awesome
2019-08-07T14:45:06  <colinclark> I have a question for you
2019-08-07T14:45:17  <the-t-in-rtf> fire away
2019-08-07T14:45:42  <colinclark> Do you feel like you have sufficient knowledge of the system to address this JIRA? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4062
2019-08-07T14:46:09  <colinclark> assuming Bosmon and cindyli helped you out, of course
2019-08-07T14:47:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I believe some of it may have already been handled in my work under review.
2019-08-07T14:47:39  <the-t-in-rtf> but certainly I have been working with @Bosmon to refactor similarly bloated per-request material.
2019-08-07T14:48:16  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/794
2019-08-07T14:49:00  <the-t-in-rtf> That includes refactored grades that keep the parts of the SR needed for validation in middleware rather than in requests.
2019-08-07T14:49:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I would need help identifying additional places to fix, but I assume the solution is very similar.
2019-08-07T14:49:20  <colinclark> if you were tasked with fixing the whole issue, any guesses on how long it would take you?
2019-08-07T14:49:23  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, it will be very similar
2019-08-07T14:49:47  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - whereas you were dealing with the instance of the SR used for validation, this is the one attached to the request grade which is used for matchmaking
2019-08-07T14:49:52  <Bosmon> Which really doesn't need to be read on every request
2019-08-07T14:50:02  <the-t-in-rtf> right
2019-08-07T14:50:13  <the-t-in-rtf> is there just the one endpoint, or are there multiples?
2019-08-07T14:50:27  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - there's just the one request grade
2019-08-07T14:51:01  <the-t-in-rtf> If I was only working on that, I guess it'd take a couple of my working days?
2019-08-07T14:51:08  <the-t-in-rtf> I say that because tomorrow and Friday are both shortish.
2019-08-07T14:51:16  <the-t-in-rtf> And then however long for the review.
2019-08-07T14:51:27  <colinclark> ok
2019-08-07T14:51:45  <colinclark> I’m trying to figure out what the best avenue is for addressing this as quickly as possible
2019-08-07T14:52:03  <colinclark> It sounds like we’re juggling a lot
2019-08-07T14:52:16  <the-t-in-rtf> thankfully things aren't broken up tomorrow, so even my short day is five solid hours
2019-08-07T14:52:45  <the-t-in-rtf> If I can get a link to the request handler I can read up in the meeting and ask whatever related questions of people
2019-08-07T14:52:48  <colinclark> ok
2019-08-07T14:52:48  <the-t-in-rtf> and then start on it in the morning
2019-08-07T14:52:53  <colinclark> I’d say just dive in, the-t-in-rtf
2019-08-07T14:53:08  <colinclark> we have some “sizing” work that is coming up
2019-08-07T14:53:29  <colinclark> and unfortunately I don’t think there’s a lot of thought or design going into it
2019-08-07T14:53:57  <colinclark> so I think if we can speed up our system with some immediate simple wins, that will be good

2019-08-07T14:58:35  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - here is the point where the SR is fetched and then filtered: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/MatchMaking.js#L96
2019-08-07T14:58:56  <Bosmon> I think it would make a huge difference if this filtering were done against a static, immutable copy of the SR
2019-08-07T15:01:43  <the-t-in-rtf> right, and whatever later work to make the SR "live" would be "near live", i.e. a periodic refresh of the static copy.
2019-08-07T15:01:53  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - indeed
2019-08-07T15:02:18  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will look through that and chat with questions.
2019-08-07T15:02:30  <the-t-in-rtf> and review my previous work to refresh my memory.
2019-08-07T15:02:33  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - brilliant!
2019-08-07T15:02:46  <the-t-in-rtf> It's still fine just using requestMiddleware and not any newer framework concept?
2019-08-07T15:03:35  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - there's not even middleware, this is simply the main request handler body

2019-08-07T15:04:45  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the main mixin grade is defined here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/MatchMaking.js#L136

2019-08-07T15:09:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Just just have a grade that sits at the app level that is injected by IoC reference in that handleRequest call?
2019-08-07T15:09:42  <the-t-in-rtf> s/just just/so, just/
2019-08-07T15:10:38  <the-t-in-rtf> similar to our work with the global validator in other areas?
2019-08-07T15:11:09  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I was imagining just changing the way the solutionsRegistryDataSource worked, plus any hardening we need in the filtering pipeline to account for the fact that the SR return is now immutable
2019-08-07T15:12:17  <the-t-in-rtf> that's another place I need more details, like areas where we currently try to change the SR data.
2019-08-07T15:12:51  <the-t-in-rtf> also, I may need help understanding the "filtering pipeline"
2019-08-07T15:14:48  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - perhaps the best way of driving the understanding might be to call fluid.freezeRecursive() on the payload and see what blows up first : P

2019-08-07T15:15:50  <the-t-in-rtf> that approach is very familiar from my work with validation tests.  Add the ability to see evil, then eradicate.

2019-08-07T15:19:51  <the-t-in-rtf> So, looking through the data source, the problem is that the data source loads the SR on each call to get?
2019-08-07T15:20:09  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. a caching dataSource that checked a member variable first would be a solution?
2019-08-07T15:20:59  <the-t-in-rtf> and that perhaps loaded things once on startup, with a hook for the future to reload on demand
2019-08-07T15:22:34  <the-t-in-rtf> And I guess that the request handler needs to avoid copying too much material?
2019-08-07T15:26:33  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - basically, yes
2019-08-07T15:27:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Right, so here:
2019-08-07T15:27:01  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/37264a5359fffe4242509ebd79152253814b6933/gpii/node_modules/matchMakerFramework/src/MatchMakerFramework.js#L68
2019-08-07T15:27:22  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - but I think that once we have filtered the SR down to just those solutions reported by the client, we will have solved > 90% of the problem
2019-08-07T15:27:23  <the-t-in-rtf> That should assemble a parallel object that only refers to the  existing SR data.
2019-08-07T15:27:42  <the-t-in-rtf> or it could if you wanted to ensure that you aren't even spiking those smaller filtered bumps
2019-08-07T15:27:52  <the-t-in-rtf> of memory wastage
2019-08-07T15:28:06  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - after we dealt with the up-front leak, we could then experiment with removing the copy()
2019-08-07T15:28:20  <Bosmon> Depending on the Object freeze to warn us of downstream unauthorised modifications
2019-08-07T15:28:48  <Bosmon> But yes, this is certainly horrible - already by this point we know we have just thrashed GC with 2 complete copies of the SR per request
2019-08-07T15:28:52  <Bosmon> Well spotted
2019-08-07T15:29:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I'm not seeing the leak just yet, I see the frequent wasted reload
2019-08-07T15:29:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I will look for other copies
2019-08-07T15:29:12  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - there is no leak, it is just a performance risk
2019-08-07T15:29:31  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I think I get it
2019-08-07T15:29:42  <Bosmon> JJ's reports were on memory exhaustion under high concurrent load
2019-08-07T15:29:54  <Bosmon> So when you have 20 requests outstanding, we now know we will have 40 copies of the SR in memory
2019-08-07T15:29:59  <Bosmon> Or more
2019-08-07T15:30:06  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@205.211.168.104> has joined #fluid-tech
2019-08-07T15:30:24  <Bosmon> They will all be cleaned up in time, but they represent a high resource exhaustion risk under load, and seriously damage request throughput
2019-08-07T15:32:35  <the-t-in-rtf> so that bit I pointed out, just make my own object and only add relevant entries, rather than copying the full thing and then pruning
2019-08-07T15:33:09  <the-t-in-rtf> and where is the other copy?
2019-08-07T15:34:19  *** danielcho1 <danielcho1!~Adium@205.211.168.103> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-08-07T15:34:57  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the first copy is the one produced by solutionsRegistry.get()
2019-08-07T15:35:01  <Bosmon> The 2nd one is the one you just found

2019-08-07T15:35:42  <the-t-in-rtf> That and the related bit below.
2019-08-07T15:36:14  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - oh wow this is mad
2019-08-07T15:36:23  <Bosmon> OK so we have FOUR copies per request :)
2019-08-07T15:36:24  <the-t-in-rtf> why are we resolving the promise with a string?
2019-08-07T15:36:32  <Bosmon> This is starting to make JJ's findings make much more sense
2019-08-07T15:36:41  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - "Pure incompetence, madam"
2019-08-07T15:37:19  <the-t-in-rtf> is there any sane reason to convert to a string?
2019-08-07T15:37:25  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - none whatsoever
2019-08-07T15:37:28  <the-t-in-rtf> ugh.
2019-08-07T15:37:33  <the-t-in-rtf> TODO: Kill it with fire
2019-08-07T15:38:04  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - this is just a remnant of the point where it was pretending to behave just like a remote dataSource backed by HTTP
2019-08-07T15:39:00  <the-t-in-rtf> So, I can stuff the SR in a member variable of the dataSource or in a model variable if you prefer.
2019-08-07T15:39:13  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the former, please
2019-08-07T15:39:17  <the-t-in-rtf> will do.
2019-08-07T15:39:30  <Bosmon> Given our plan is to keep any data processing mitts off it by making it strongly immutable
2019-08-07T15:40:07  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a fair point
2019-08-07T15:40:48  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the future model system will actually work that way, but for the time being we will just have to stick our feet through the bottom of the car
2019-08-07T15:40:54  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, it's already a member variable
2019-08-07T15:41:29  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - right, we just need to trash the majority of code in this file
