2020-07-21T18:21:57  <gtirloni> Interesting article about security in GitHub Actions but also about repo security -- https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2020/07/safely-use-github-actions-in-organizations/
2020-07-21T18:22:46  <gtirloni> it would be great to have all of our repos' configuration in code -- https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/github/index.html
2020-07-21T18:24:49  <gtirloni> Justin_o: it could be a nice project after we review all perms/configs ^^^
2020-07-21T18:45:51  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for sharing, I'll take a look
2020-07-21T18:49:38  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I skimmed through the first article. I think we're mostly good there. We do have a task to review teams and user permissions. I guess we could require PRs, we sort of do that informally.
2020-07-21T18:50:12  <Justin_o> or maybe implicitly is a better word. It's just enforced through GitHub, more by convention I guess.
2020-07-21T18:51:25  <Justin_o> gtirloni: could you explain a bit about the benefit of Terraform
2020-07-21T18:59:35  <gtirloni> it's basically applying the 'infrastructure as code' principles to the github configuration
2020-07-21T18:59:49  <gtirloni> instead of point/click in the interface, we'd edit code and apply through terraform
2020-07-21T19:00:22  <gtirloni> this is how we manage the infrastructure, it'd just extend the concept to github.. to consider it as infrastructure as well
2020-07-21T19:00:41  <gtirloni> terraform can be scheduled to run periodically, find deviations from the config, etc
2020-07-21T19:47:43  <Justin_o> gtirloni: where would the configuration/code be stored?
2020-07-21T19:49:04  <gtirloni> in any git repo. it could be a directory inside some infra repo, or have its own repo, etc
2020-07-21T19:49:57  <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay.. any chance that we could accidentally lock ourselves out?
2020-07-21T19:51:20  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I'm not sure.. maybe, if GitHub allows us to remove all members from an org.. I'm unsure
