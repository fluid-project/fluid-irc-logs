2019-04-04T13:56:00  <simonjb> hi alanharnum, I'm looking at your infusion-docs PR now and I was wondering about the removal of the Deploy notes from README.md and the changes to docpad.js -- those appear to be unrelated to the changes to support Node 10? or are they related?
2019-04-04T14:02:03  <alanharnum> simonjb: those look to be from Justin_o's work on the branch before I took it over, so the answer is unfortunately "I'm not sure"
2019-04-04T14:03:16  <simonjb> alanharnum: are we still hosting on GitHub pages?
2019-04-04T14:03:32  <alanharnum> simonjb: No
2019-04-04T14:04:14  <alanharnum> but the deployment instructions should still be in there - it's possible they were removed with intention to rewrite them and that got missed
2019-04-04T14:04:39  <simonjb> ok, so all this copying stuff that we did to move stuff around for GitHub pages can probably be removed
2019-04-04T14:04:39  <alanharnum> I will have a look and see what should be retained
2019-04-04T14:04:48  <alanharnum> yeah I suspect that is why
2019-04-04T14:05:08  <simonjb> we should remove rather than comment out though, I think
2019-04-04T14:06:05  <simonjb> alanharnum: that would be great if you could have a look, could you ping me when ready and I can take another look then?
2019-04-04T14:08:41  <alanharnum> simonjb: will do - I want to make sure there isn't a missing piece here, as I know gtirloni was working on something to have the CI responsible for building the DocPad based site, but I believe that was blocked by the same plugin issues
2019-04-04T14:09:01  <simonjb> understood
