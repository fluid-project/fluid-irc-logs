2019-07-09T14:40:32  <alanharnum> a friend of mine mentioned this to me on the weekend & it's rather interesting to look at: https://stampit.js.org/ - closest other thing I've seen in certain respects (not that I am familiar with everything in the "a new framework a day" world of modern JS) to how Infusion grades work (the "composable factory function" concept in particular)

2019-07-09T15:07:25  <gmoss> alanharnum: neato! I admit I read only the first half of your message, clicked the link, saw the diagram and thought to myself: "hey, that looks a lot like infusion!", then saw that you covered that already :) I like their naming/terminology. I think "grade" is a tricky word to grok wrt what it really is, personally.
2019-07-09T15:07:52  <gmoss> also interesting how the merging extends to functions, properties, etc.
2019-07-09T15:08:01  <gmoss> *methods, not functions
