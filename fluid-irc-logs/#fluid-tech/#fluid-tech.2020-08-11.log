2020-08-11T15:04:20  <sbates> the-t-in-rtf: another input mechanism that might be interesting to explore would be a radial menu, are you familiar with those?
2020-08-11T15:04:46  <the-t-in-rtf> that's what I was thinking of when I mentioned Animal Crossing
2020-08-11T15:04:51  <sbates> cool
2020-08-11T15:05:08  <sbates> super neat project
2020-08-11T15:05:09  <the-t-in-rtf> they have several
2020-08-11T15:05:47  <the-t-in-rtf> they also have lots of smart stuff like the dpad providing quick access to different things in different contexts
2020-08-11T15:05:49  <the-t-in-rtf> with onscreen hints
2020-08-11T15:06:01  <the-t-in-rtf> and hotkeys that trigger radial menus
2020-08-11T15:06:07  <the-t-in-rtf> hotkey combos that trigger radial menus
2020-08-11T15:06:09  <sbates> yeah, nintendo does a really good job of UI
2020-08-11T15:06:53  <the-t-in-rtf> and at completely stripping away the bits you really don't need for a given context.
2020-08-11T15:07:04  <the-t-in-rtf> like half the complex deep menus disappear when you're swiming/diving
2020-08-11T15:07:26  <sbates> I remember using Mario Maker on the Wii U and being really impressed by how they communicated modes
2020-08-11T15:07:29  <the-t-in-rtf> it's very natural
2020-08-11T15:07:41  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, that's for later in the year, very curious about maker 2
2020-08-11T15:07:56  <the-t-in-rtf> especially seeing what kind of less-mario-like content you can create
2020-08-11T15:08:26  <sbates> there was a delete mode, if I remember correctly, and when you entered it, they had an animation and persistent sound effect to remind you that you are in the mode
2020-08-11T15:09:07  <sbates> they made it just annoying enough so that you couldn't ignore it
2020-08-11T15:09:18  <sbates> but not so annoying that it was unpleasant
2020-08-11T15:09:32  <sbates> it's those kind of details that they are very strong at
2020-08-11T15:15:03  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I'm very curious to try Origami King for the kind of puzzle encounters.
2020-08-11T15:15:15  <the-t-in-rtf> like somehow they keep finding neat new UIs that are pretty intuitive
2020-08-11T15:16:02  <sbates> I've been watching some of Origami King on Twitch, I don't have a Switch but getting closer and closer to getting one
2020-08-11T15:16:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I got it before the start of my holiday
2020-08-11T15:16:38  <the-t-in-rtf> like two weeks ago
2020-08-11T15:17:17  <the-t-in-rtf> vs. the cost of flying somewhere it's a good vacation spot
2020-08-11T15:17:23  <the-t-in-rtf> and the risk, man.
2020-08-11T15:17:23  <sbates> I switched from Windows to Linux on my main computer and I've been missing playing games, so I might get a Switch
2020-08-11T15:17:33  <sbates> totally
2020-08-11T15:18:10  <the-t-in-rtf> they tend to get triple A games less often and late, and their controllers are the worst of the three (even if they can do novel and interesting things)
2020-08-11T15:18:15  <the-t-in-rtf> but otherwise I'm happy
2020-08-11T15:19:04  <the-t-in-rtf> apparently you can use a DNS hack to open the browser on the switch that's used for some of the online content
2020-08-11T15:19:25  <the-t-in-rtf> it obviously supports the gamepad API, but I believe it also supports WebAudio
2020-08-11T15:19:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm idly thinking of making pages for it just to finally make the pokeball plus theremin I have in mind
2020-08-11T15:21:28  <colinclark> lol
2020-08-11T15:22:28  <sbates> the problem with getting a Switch right now in this part of the world, is that they are sold out everywhere
2020-08-11T15:22:42  <sbates> the Switch Lite is easier to get
2020-08-11T15:22:51  <the-t-in-rtf> German Amazon had them, but I did have to look around a bit.
2020-08-11T15:22:52  <sbates> but the regular ones are hard to find
2020-08-11T15:23:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to give up on the Animal Crossing edition.
2020-08-11T15:24:07  <the-t-in-rtf> but multiple friends here have hunkered down with one, maybe they supplied this market better somehow
2020-08-11T15:27:59  <gmoss> sbates: if you do get a Switch (or Switch Lite), I recommend getting the Pro controller as well, makes a big difference in hand comfort :)
2020-08-11T15:29:17  <sbates> thanks gmoss, I've been missing Nintendo games recently (I sold my Wii U and 3DS years ago)
2020-08-11T15:30:04  <sbates> there are some games on Linux, but the experience is pretty bad
2020-08-11T15:48:37  <the-t-in-rtf> ++ on the pro controller
