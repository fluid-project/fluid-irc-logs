2020-08-28T10:55:55  <percival> Hi Everyone, I'm new here but I've seen some of your projects via GSOC and would like to contribute. Could you help me out on how to start ?
2020-08-28T12:15:01  <gtirloni> percival: Hi there, that's great that you want to get involved. My advice is to start by reading the following pages: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3900010  and  https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved
2020-08-28T12:15:47  <gtirloni> percival: it'd be nice to subscribe to the fluid-work mailing list and send an email introducing your self and how you could contribute.. that would help figure out some initial tasks :)
