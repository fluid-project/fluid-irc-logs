2020-02-26T14:12:09  <kasparnet3> Bosmon, jhernandez: I'm embarrassingly not succeeding at installing the GPII
2020-02-26T14:12:28  <kasparnet3> I downloaded the latest gpii-app and running vagrant up
2020-02-26T14:12:36  <kasparnet3> and it fails with https://pastebin.com/5bz032Ba
2020-02-26T14:17:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I think there is a known issue at the moment, perhaps @stegru or @bosmon can comment
2020-02-26T14:17:47  <jhernandez> kasparnet3: well, we need to get both repos in sync after the last box update
2020-02-26T14:18:07  <kasparnet3> oh ok
2020-02-26T14:18:20  <kasparnet3> so if I want to install everything, I'd use an installer instead
2020-02-26T14:18:24  <jhernandez> that's my point in last arch meeting, getting ci back on track
2020-02-26T14:18:56  <stegru> kasparnet3, you could try javi's GPII-4004 branch... that's what is currently released
2020-02-26T14:20:01  <jhernandez> well, actually the last installer came from my gpii-app/GPII-4214.GPII-3572 branch
2020-02-26T14:20:26  <jhernandez> which I'm not sure it'll build in the last released vagrant box
2020-02-26T14:21:31  <jhernandez> that branch includes the 4 state on/off switch - among many other stuff
2020-02-26T14:22:17  <jhernandez> FYI, here's my WIP tech debt list
2020-02-26T14:22:47  <jhernandez> hm
2020-02-26T14:24:08  <jhernandez> ok, gnome online pasting tool not working

2020-02-26T16:38:56  <dmahajan980> Hello @Aarsh! You can try installing the extension on your browser and start playing with it.
2020-02-26T16:39:51  <dmahajan980> You can set up the repository on your local machine from the following: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/
2020-02-26T16:41:05  <dmahajan980> Do check out the existing issues and try to solve them after discussion with the mentors.
2020-02-26T16:41:31  <dmahajan980> For any other doubts that you have, feel free to put them here!
