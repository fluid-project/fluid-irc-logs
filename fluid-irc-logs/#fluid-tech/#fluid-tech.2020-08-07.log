2020-08-07T19:12:14  <philip> gmoss: The test issue is getting weirder still. It appears for some reason running jqUnit.asyncTest does...something...which breaks the resourceLoader I mentioned before
2020-08-07T19:14:11  <gmoss> philip: hmm.. are you using jqUnit.start() and jqUnit.stop() in matched pairs, as well? how is it breaking?
2020-08-07T19:14:40  <gmoss> or is this what breaks it in the way you mentioned earlier today?
2020-08-07T19:15:25  <philip> gmoss: same issue as earlier. There's a particular resourceLoader that never produces the onResourcesLoaded event when a particular set of test files are run together
2020-08-07T19:17:47  <philip> It's a little involved to explain here. Are you still up for pairing, gmoss?
2020-08-07T19:18:55  <gmoss> philip: sure! I'm just looking at some storytelling tool code real quick to see what it uses to test the TemplateManager component (which has TWO resourceLoaders! :P)
2020-08-07T19:18:55  <gmoss> I also want to refill my water, so shall we plan to pair at 15:25?
2020-08-07T19:20:05  <philip> Maybe 15:35? I'm trying to remove everything that isn't contributing to the weirdness, so it's a little easier to review
2020-08-07T19:21:03  <gmoss> philip: sure :)
2020-08-07T19:35:29  <gmoss> philip: looks like the standup room is available
