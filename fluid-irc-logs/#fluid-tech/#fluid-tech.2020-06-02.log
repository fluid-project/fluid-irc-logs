2020-06-02T17:50:24  <philip> Justin_o, gmoss, simonjb: I am looking for an Infusion method to get a reference to a component with a uniquely identifying grade name given a reference to another component in the same tree. Essentially, I want to execute an IoCSS query like "{that kettle.server} nexusComponentRoot" in javascript. In the DOM API, it would be something like somDOMElement.closest('body').querySelector('.nexusComponentRoot'). I thought fluid.queryIoCSelector w
2020-06-02T17:50:24  <philip> as what I needed, but it seems not. Any ideas?
2020-06-02T17:52:36  <Justin_o> philip: does it have to be in JavaScript and not provided through the IoC framework?
2020-06-02T17:54:29  <gmoss> philip: assuming you need to have this reference to do some sort of manipulation of it in JS, is it not enough to call the manipulator function (whatever it is) and pass in the IoC reference from Infusion?
2020-06-02T17:54:37  <philip> Justin_o, are you suggesting that I attach the query I want to process to a component and pass it into the function where I need the reference?
2020-06-02T17:55:33  <Justin_o> philip: yes, maybe as part of the invoker definition of that function.. but I'm not sure of the specific case you have
2020-06-02T17:55:49  <philip> That sounds like a good idiomatic solution, Justin_o, gmoss. Thanks!
2020-06-02T17:56:01  <philip> Let me see if I can get that working
2020-06-02T17:56:03  <gmoss> philip: np, hopefully that solves your question :)
2020-06-02T17:56:07  <Justin_o> good luck

2020-06-02T19:11:28  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: I've created a channel #fluid-changelog to record the changes I do to our infrastructure. It's something I've seen/used at other workplaces and it helps with communication and keeping everybody on the loop. If you're interested in those topics and/or want to contribute (e.g. added/removed someone in github, rebooted server, etc), feel free to join. The channel is logged at
