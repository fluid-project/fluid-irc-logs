2020-02-27T01:07:33  <theIYD> I have a question regarding the use case of the project. What is the purpose of using a gamepad controller to navigate a website ? Why would anybody use an Xbox controller to navigate through a normal website unless it's a game ?

2020-02-27T10:28:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Quick update, @Bosmon and @javjarfer[m].  There are so many values that aren't right at the tests that I was suspecting something deeper was going on.

2020-02-27T10:31:54  <the-t-in-rtf> did you figure out which setting was incorrect?
2020-02-27T10:35:08  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: no, at that point is when I thought that maybe the problem was with master and opened the other issue
2020-02-27T10:35:33  <javjarfer[m]> I think that it may be related to FILTER_KEYS but it's just a guess, could be more offending ones
2020-02-27T10:35:52  <the-t-in-rtf> I think I may need to add checks for everything in tests/data/preferences

2020-02-27T10:51:57  <the-t-in-rtf> here's an example of setting it:

2020-02-27T10:52:17  <the-t-in-rtf> it's obviously supposed to be a string, I just need a sane default.
2020-02-27T10:52:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume you entered that one?
2020-02-27T10:56:25  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: hey there, yes that was me, it's an error for copy pasting another schema, https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/f6cb781da5a30921a4ec116ee851b07385bc58db/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L9509
2020-02-27T10:56:28  <javjarfer[m]> that one I think
2020-02-27T10:57:09  <javjarfer[m]> the value in the preference set is correct, the color needs to be expressed in hexadecimal format like that
2020-02-27T10:57:42  <javjarfer[m]> normally, the preference set values are correct, because they have been tested, the schema definitions have been added later, and had no tests until now
2020-02-27T10:57:58  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I could guess that's how it got there
2020-02-27T10:58:07  <the-t-in-rtf> (copy and paste, I mean)
2020-02-27T10:58:09  <the-t-in-rtf> any guess at the default?
2020-02-27T11:00:23  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: no idea, will need to pick it from the AT files themselves

2020-02-27T11:08:57  <the-t-in-rtf> They all now match the schema at least

2020-02-27T11:37:39  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: defaults are good to have, but I think that probably missing ones should go into new tickets, probably when doing the AT builds for testing in QA is a good time to revisit the missing ones
2020-02-27T11:38:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I put them in if I can when I find them

2020-02-27T11:39:04  <the-t-in-rtf> even if sometimes we have to file a ticket and leave it for later
2020-02-27T11:52:17  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I got the login errors down to zero in the acceptance test runs
2020-02-27T11:52:24  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully what's left is just adjusting expected values
2020-02-27T11:53:26  <the-t-in-rtf> ugh, nope, tricked by my console
2020-02-27T11:55:27  <the-t-in-rtf> so, even if I comment out every setting in os_win, I get the same error, which to me suggests that there's a setting coming from the defaults that triggers the error
2020-02-27T11:59:17  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @bosmon, is there something that goes through the capability transforms and chooses not to transform them if the necessary inputs (referenced settings) are missing?
2020-02-27T12:06:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm seeing a lot of undefined settiings that aren't in the original payload, I think they're coming from transforms
2020-02-27T12:06:10  <the-t-in-rtf> of default values

2020-02-27T12:16:29  <the-t-in-rtf> and I'm setting those set to "undefined" in the logs
2020-02-27T12:20:05  <the-t-in-rtf> what's very interesting is that if I set that common term to something, say ["mouse"] the SPI login errors disappear
2020-02-27T12:20:34  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the default for the common term
2020-02-27T12:21:08  <the-t-in-rtf> so the lack of a value is resulting in those SPI login errors, because the SPI settings handler is trying to work with undefined values.
2020-02-27T12:21:19  <the-t-in-rtf> or at least it seems that way.
