2020-04-14T17:40:52  <philip> Extremely basic question about the Infusion API: how do I programmatically get the component or model material at a particular path? It seems like fluid.get should be what I'm looking for, but I don't understand what is meant by "indirecting into a model object" in the documentation at https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluidgetmodel-path
2020-04-14T17:43:02  <philip> So far I've relied completely on logging from inside listener functions etc, but for debugging purposes, I'd like to be able to get and set component state from the global scope in Node
2020-04-14T17:44:36  <colinclark> hey philip
2020-04-14T17:45:10  <colinclark> fluid.get just takes an object, and a path, and gives you the value
2020-04-14T17:45:38  <colinclark> var m = { barn: { cat: “meow” } };
2020-04-14T17:45:51  <colinclark> fluid.get(m, “barn.cat”)
2020-04-14T17:45:54  <colinclark> will return "meow"
2020-04-14T17:46:41  <gmoss> you can also pass in the second arg as an array, if that's easier for some reason, so fluid.get(m, ["barn", "cat"]);
2020-04-14T17:46:54  <colinclark> yeah, the path segments
2020-04-14T17:47:02  <philip> Okay, so can I get a hold of the component root to pass in as the model object?
2020-04-14T17:47:17  <colinclark> Nearly everywhere, path segments are accepted anywhere an EL path string is
2020-04-14T17:47:53  <colinclark> yeah, anything object-like should be fine in that first argument to fluid.get()
2020-04-14T17:48:42  <colinclark> I am curious about what you’re implementing—I’m not sure I’ve typically used fluid.get directly like this except in certain circumstances
2020-04-14T17:50:11  <philip> It's purely for debugging at the moment, for inspecting component models "from the outside", to convince myself they're real :P
2020-04-14T17:51:19  *** clown <clown!~clown@ckvlon1747w-140-01-65-94-143-173.dsl.bell.ca> has joined #fluid-tech
2020-04-14T17:51:19  <gmoss> philip: here's an example of using it the 'proper' way with the model being passed in: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/tests/ui/js/binderTests.js#L85
2020-04-14T17:51:19  <gmoss> I would also suggest being wary of the timing when you call get, i.e. make sure the component is fully constructed and not destroyed yet, etc etc
2020-04-14T17:54:38  <colinclark> philip: for debugging, you can often just use an IoC reference
2020-04-14T17:54:44  <colinclark> e.g.
2020-04-14T17:55:13  <colinclark> {“this”: “console”, method: “log”, args: [“{myComponent}.model.barn.cat”]} etc.
2020-04-14T17:55:44  <philip> Ah, I'd been trying to do something like that, but had the keys wrong
2020-04-14T17:56:57  <philip> Related question: fluid.log doesn't log anything to the Node console by default, am I missing some bit of configuration to make it forward to console.log? Or should I just use console.log directly?
2020-04-14T17:57:05  <colinclark> hmm
2020-04-14T17:57:27  <colinclark> that surprises me, actually
2020-04-14T17:57:35  <gmoss> philip: it might be related to your logging level
2020-04-14T17:57:43  <gmoss> the first argument to fluid.log
2020-04-14T17:58:15  <gmoss> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-316
2020-04-14T17:58:17  <gmoss> whoops
2020-04-14T17:58:20  <gmoss> https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluidloglevel
2020-04-14T17:58:34  <philip> I experimented with different logging levels, don't seem to be making a difference
2020-04-14T18:00:03  <colinclark> philip: Does a call to fluid.setLogging() help at all?
2020-04-14T18:00:36  <colinclark> you could start with true for its argument
2020-04-14T18:00:56  <philip> There's what I was looking for :)
2020-04-14T18:01:10  <colinclark> which sets it to a log level of fluid.logLevel.INFO
2020-04-14T18:02:09  <colinclark> https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluidsetloggingloglevel
2020-04-14T18:02:13  <philip> There's not a lot of "situated examples", making it tricky for me to interpret the documentation a lot of the time. Good thing I can ask you all :)
2020-04-14T18:03:29  <colinclark> philip: It looks like the framework defaults to the IMPORTANT level
2020-04-14T18:03:58  <colinclark> philip: This is the “situated example” I used to learn about it, so that I was sure I was advising you correctly: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UnderstandingInfusionComponents.html
2020-04-14T18:04:12  <colinclark> but alan’s tutorial is quite good

2020-04-14T18:05:44  <philip> Ah great, thanks. I have looked at those before, but years ago
2020-04-14T18:09:40  <philip> Just to clarify about fluid.get, my intuition is that fluid.get(fluid.rootComponent, "some.path.to.a.component") should allow me inspect arbitrary components, but fluid.rootComponent does not appear to be what I want
2020-04-14T18:12:33  <colinclark> probably not :)

2020-04-14T18:16:09  <philip> I feel like I need a mechanism to inspect the tree from the node console, because I'm still at the stage where I get the declarative code wrong several times before I get it right, and I often have no clue what's going on in the tree
2020-04-14T18:23:16  <colinclark> what aspect of the tree do you want to inspect?
2020-04-14T18:23:27  <colinclark> what kinds of mistakes are you encounting that you want to debug better?

2020-04-14T18:37:33  <colinclark> philip: one of the things I like VS Code for is that I can use the Node debugger with it
2020-04-14T18:38:02  <colinclark> so I’ll often stick a breakpoint somewhere so I can poke around with a particular component to see its state
2020-04-14T18:42:59  <philip> Currently, I have a model listener that doesn't seem to do anything at all
2020-04-14T18:43:44  <philip> Thanks for the tips. I'll try going over the tutorials again and using the debugger
2020-04-14T18:46:04  <colinclark> in a case of a model listener not working, for example, i might create a “dummy listener” function so I can throw a breakpoint in there and confirm that it’s being called
2020-04-14T18:46:10  <colinclark> inspect the state of components etc.
2020-04-14T18:47:10  <colinclark> so something like modelListeners: { “barn.cat”: { funcName: “my.listenerFunc”, args: [{that}]}, along with a little function like my.listenerFunc = function (that) { console.log(that); };
2020-04-14T18:47:16  <colinclark> and then i can stick a breakpoint in there and poke around
2020-04-14T18:47:34  <colinclark> i’m not a particularly sophisticated debugger of infusion apps in this regard
2020-04-14T18:47:51  <colinclark> but it’s helpful to have a place to stick a breakpoint to see what’s what
