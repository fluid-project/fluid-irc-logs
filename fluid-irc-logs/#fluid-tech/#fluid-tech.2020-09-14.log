2020-09-14T16:37:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: Any thoughts on this? https://github.com/qunitjs/qunitjs.com/issues/163#issuecomment-691709701
2020-09-14T16:38:04  <Bosmon> Well it's a little awkward, yes
2020-09-14T16:38:10  <Justin_o> I think the mention on their site is fine, wondering if the node-jqUnit mention is quite accurate, but maybe accurate enough. And also not sure of all the reasons why we have the forked version of qunit and if we can bring that up with them for help upgrading?
2020-09-14T16:38:10  <Bosmon> Our use of Qunit is incredibly backward
2020-09-14T16:39:14  <Bosmon> But we have patched it for some concurrency issues it had, and it would be a fair amount of work to check whether we can upgrade safely or not
2020-09-14T16:39:39  <Bosmon> The IoC testing framework hooks into its lifecycle in fairly intimate ways
2020-09-14T16:39:58  <Bosmon> I imagine we have no objection to being listed as users of QUnit ...
2020-09-14T16:41:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. I'll mention that we are okay with being listed. If you have an articulation of why we have forked that I can share back, or just want to comment on the ticket please do so. It would be great to have this updated if it's something that we could actually feasibly achieve. I haven't tracked their latest versions though, so not sure what's changed.
2020-09-14T16:42:04  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I checked some while ago and found I couldn't really locate the equivalents of the code sites I had patched
2020-09-14T16:42:16  <Bosmon> So it's not going to be a trivial thing
2020-09-14T16:43:01  <Bosmon> I guess I can try to write a short high-level description of why we have a fork of such an old version
2020-09-14T16:47:53  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for doing that
2020-09-14T16:48:07  <Justin_o> probably useful for our future selves too
2020-09-14T16:50:24  <Bosmon> Yes
2020-09-14T18:46:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I left this comment https://github.com/qunitjs/qunitjs.com/issues/163#issuecomment-692242200
