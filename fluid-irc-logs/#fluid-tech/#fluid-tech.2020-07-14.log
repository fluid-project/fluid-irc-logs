2020-07-14T14:59:26  <philip> Does anyone use VSCode and its ESLint extension? gmoss? I'm trying to set it up to continuously lint using the local configuration for e.g. Kettle, but I think I'm missing a step
2020-07-14T15:02:59  <the-t-in_> VSCode or VSCodium?
2020-07-14T15:02:59  <philip> aaand it works. Clearly giving up and asking is a mandatory part of the setup process
2020-07-14T15:03:04  <the-t-in_> haaa
2020-07-14T15:03:08  <philip> VSCodium :)
2020-07-14T15:03:18  <the-t-in_> I ask because I was planning to install VSCodium like all the cool kids.
2020-07-14T15:03:35  <philip> It works a treat for me
2020-07-14T15:03:39  <the-t-in_> I gave up on VSCode after three days
2020-07-14T15:03:53  * gtirloni just learned vscodium exists
2020-07-14T15:03:54  <the-t-in_> but probably I should use it exclusively for a single project for a while.
2020-07-14T15:04:46  <philip> Why do you think VSCodium would be different the-t-in_? Just ready to try again?
2020-07-14T15:05:22  <the-t-in_> need to learn a new framework (React) and was considering trying it there
2020-07-14T15:05:41  <the-t-in_> I think my previous experience was just down to not sticking with it to learn the strengths
2020-07-14T15:05:47  <gmoss> philip: glad you got it working! I use prettier in VSCode, but Atom is my primary "IDE"
2020-07-14T15:05:50  <the-t-in_> kind of like sticking with emacs for text editing
2020-07-14T15:06:03  <the-t-in_> I gave up on Atom after two days for similar reasons
2020-07-14T15:06:17  <philip> Yeah, I am a strong believer in pushing myself to acquire tastes
2020-07-14T15:06:17  <the-t-in_> I need to stick with one for long enough to really "get" the things it helps with.
2020-07-14T15:06:43  <the-t-in_> although there's also something to be said about having a space in your brain that's just for key combos
2020-07-14T15:06:47  <the-t-in_> emacs is like a fighting game
2020-07-14T15:07:03  <philip> "like a fighting game" is an interesting endorsement of an editor
2020-07-14T15:07:25  <the-t-in_> you have to memorise complex patterns for a few months and then it's fun
2020-07-14T15:07:54  <the-t-in_> I had a friend who was a die-hard vim user who wanted to make an escape key pedal for under his desk
2020-07-14T15:07:54  <philip> Yeah, I guess the fact that I'm competent in vim is proof to myself that I *could* be a proficient starcraft player :P
2020-07-14T15:08:10  <the-t-in_> since he kept knocking them off his normal keyboards
2020-07-14T15:08:18  <the-t-in_> at least emacs distributes the load
2020-07-14T15:08:33  <philip> right onto your pinky finger
2020-07-14T15:09:09  <the-t-in_> I remember training for WCIII builds, serious starcraft is like training yourself to be  a computer
2020-07-14T15:09:27  <the-t-in_> do exactly the right steps in the right order, build up thousand step macros for scenarios
2020-07-14T15:09:38  <the-t-in_> and then multitasking through them
2020-07-14T15:09:45  <the-t-in_> it's exhausting
2020-07-14T15:09:50  <the-t-in_> I prefer turn based
2020-07-14T15:10:13  <the-t-in_> you can use the restroom
2020-07-14T15:11:27  <philip> Hah, I feel like it's a choice between overloading my brain with anxiety (real-time) or paralyzing trying to evaluate combinatoric scenarios (turn-based)
2020-07-14T15:12:15  <philip> paralyzing it*
2020-07-14T15:17:34  <colinclark> i vastly prefer the latter
2020-07-14T15:29:26  <sbates> the-t-in_: I've considered getting foot pedals for Emacs modifiers
2020-07-14T15:30:26  <sbates> but have resisted so far
2020-07-14T15:35:26  <gmoss> sbates: I have a Stinkyboard prototype at the office if you'd like to give that a try: http://www.stinkyboard.com/
2020-07-14T15:36:19  <sbates> gmoss: neat
2020-07-14T15:39:25  <sbates> gmoss: it looks like it needs some Windows software to configure, is that right? can it output any key? including modifiers?
2020-07-14T15:50:17  <gmoss> sbates: sorry, Planning meeting in progress :) the software requirement sounds familiar, and yes I believe it works with modifiers. it's been a few years since I've used it
