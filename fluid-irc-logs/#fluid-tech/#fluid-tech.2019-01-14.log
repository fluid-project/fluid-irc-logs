2019-01-14T17:06:22  <simonjb> avtar: Justin_o and I have been documenting approaches to using UIO in projects: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Managing+UIO+in+a+project
2019-01-14T17:07:16  <simonjb> I'm thinking that you have been using option 2 "Check out the project source code and use Grunt to make a custom build" -- or have you been doing something different that we haven't included yet?
