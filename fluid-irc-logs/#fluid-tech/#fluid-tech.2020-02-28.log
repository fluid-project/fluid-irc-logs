2020-02-28T15:26:01  <cindyli1> Bosmon: regarding https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4379, i have a few questions:
2020-02-28T15:27:55  *** dmahajan980 <dmahajan980!uid411152@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-mhqvjkysyajvbtey> has quit IRC (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
2020-02-28T15:28:37  <cindyli1> 1. the spec says the system will not reset at key-out. in fact, keyout never calls reset to default at keyout. it was because the reset to default was called at key-in, which are then stored in the lifecycle manager session model.originalSettings. at the key out, restoring originalSettings looks like re-performing reset to default. so disabling the reset at key-in will automatically disable the reset at keyout
2020-02-28T15:30:51  <cindyli1> but the other part is, even when reset to default is not performed at key in, if users change some settings after key in, at key out, these setting will be restored to their original values. so with quick start turned on, these changed settings should no longer be restored, right?
2020-02-28T15:30:53  *** iqbalsyamilayas <iqbalsyamilayas!~iqbalsyam@36.69.199.206> has joined #fluid-tech
2020-02-28T15:31:57  <Bosmon> cindyli1 - as I understand it, the behaviour is about reset at system shutdown, not at key-out
2020-02-28T15:32:09  <Bosmon> Of course, under some deployment scenarios, the two times coincide
2020-02-28T15:32:58  <Bosmon> But further work is underway right now on GPII-4370 by stegru, javjarfer[m] and jhernandez so we should probably wait for the outcome of that work first
2020-02-28T15:33:15  <cindyli1> ok
2020-02-28T15:33:40  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-02-28T15:35:39  <Bosmon> cindyli - I'd been meaning to talk to you about the reset to standard from URL -> "noUser" race condition that you were talking about last week
2020-02-28T15:35:52  <Bosmon> Is this written up as a JIRA yet?
2020-02-28T15:36:08  <cindyli> no Bosmon. i can write one
2020-02-28T15:36:13  <Bosmon> And do you think it could be responsible for the race test failure that we sometimes have in gpii-app ?
2020-02-28T15:36:29  <Bosmon> cindyli - where did you observe the problem, is it in some universal test runs?
2020-02-28T15:36:42  <cindyli> Bosmon: it's in the production config test
2020-02-28T15:37:30  <cindyli> most regular node universal tests won't run into this problem because setting up couchdb docker takes much longer than fetching from a remote url
2020-02-28T15:38:49  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you have an example of the race test failure in gpii-app? i believe some recent failures were because the model path that gpii-app reads from pspchannel output was not correct
2020-02-28T15:39:01  <Bosmon> cindyli - here is one that I mean: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/176#issuecomment-584646888
2020-02-28T15:39:11  <Bosmon> Do you think this bug could be responsible for this race?
2020-02-28T15:39:39  <Bosmon> There is one other pull we saw this issue in recently but I don't find it quickly
2020-02-28T15:40:22  <cindyli> Bosmon: this one should be the mode path problem
2020-02-28T15:41:01  <cindyli> renaming all "activeContextName" -> "activePrefsSetName" should fix it
2020-02-28T15:41:59  <Bosmon> cindyli - but actually we received this failure on your own pull itself :)
2020-02-28T15:42:00  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/178#issuecomment-584648828
2020-02-28T15:42:28  <Bosmon> Ah
2020-02-28T15:42:33  <Bosmon> It was before your adjustment
2020-02-28T15:42:34  <Bosmon> OK good
2020-02-28T15:42:36  <cindyli> right
2020-02-28T15:42:48  <Bosmon> So if we are lucky we are just left with the ffi-napi issue
2020-02-28T15:43:02  <Bosmon> I guess I need to understand stegru's fix a bit better
2020-02-28T15:43:10  <Bosmon> Why do we build this "from another drive" ....
2020-02-28T15:43:24  *** clown <clown!~clown@ckvlon1747w-lp140-05-70-49-156-238.dsl.bell.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-02-28T15:43:30  <cindyli> Bosmon: i think so. gpii-app testing framework already has noUserLoggedIn included to prevent the race: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L158-L163
2020-02-28T15:44:02  *** clown <clown!~clown@ckvlon1747w-lp140-05-70-49-156-238.dsl.bell.ca> has joined #fluid-tech
2020-02-28T15:45:55  <stegru> because it pulls packages from the parent's node_modules, Bosmon. I'm not sure why that matters, however.
2020-02-28T15:47:47  <stegru> ah, perhaps because gpii-app's native modules are built for electron
2020-02-28T15:50:22  <cindyli> Bosmon: i have more questions about "quick start" implementation. the spec says: "When a user logs into the operating system, the system will NOT do a clean-up reset IFF Quick Start is enabled". other than the clean up at auto key-in, flow manager also supports a "resetAtStart" flag. when it's set to true, reset to default will be performed at the system startup.
2020-02-28T15:50:43  <cindyli> so shall quickStart.enabled === true defeats resetAtStart === true?
2020-02-28T15:51:14  <cindyli> so when quickStart is enabled, both reset at system start and key in will be disabled?

2020-02-28T16:27:08  <Bosmon> stegru - ok yes, I see
2020-02-28T16:33:13  <jhernandez> Bosmon: sorry, skype's on fire
2020-02-28T16:33:33  <jhernandez> I see that you already merged grudel's fix for GPII-4370
2020-02-28T16:34:02  <jhernandez> but yet, we have settings that won't get restored when shutting down/signing out
2020-02-28T16:34:09  <Bosmon> OK
2020-02-28T16:34:21  <jhernandez> but hey, we're experiencing this with high contrast
2020-02-28T16:34:51  <Bosmon> But that one is well-known to start a process, right?
2020-02-28T16:35:00  <jhernandez> and other stuff, but they don't block the user to sign out of the user session as far as we can tell
2020-02-28T16:35:04  <jhernandez> yup
2020-02-28T16:38:39  <jhernandez> and I'd say that, for this reason, killing reset-to-std at startup might not be a good idea -but I think we all already know about it
2020-02-28T16:39:09  <Bosmon> jhernandez - right
2020-02-28T16:39:32  <Bosmon> I did think with cindyli above that we should wait for the resolution of this issue first
2020-02-28T16:41:11  <cindyli> cool
2020-02-28T16:46:32  * jhernandez nods

2020-02-28T19:41:39  <gmoss> Welcome, taz. the-t-in-rtf is the mentor on that project, though he's currently offline. If you haven't checked it out yet, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the Wiki page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-02-28T19:42:08  <gmoss> beyond that, if you have any specific questions, you could ask them in #fluid-work and mention the-t-in-rtf in your message, or you can mail the fluid-work mailing list
