2019-04-09T13:46:52  <simonjb> alanharnum: I'm wondering about all this work to update docpad stuff -- could we just stay on Node 8? are all our issues related to Node 10?
2019-04-09T13:48:16  <simonjb> Node 8 will be supported until December 2019
2019-04-09T13:48:35  <simonjb> https://github.com/nodejs/Release
2019-04-09T13:49:47  <simonjb> but as we are running dodpad internally -- only the output is public -- it's probably fine to keep using it?
2019-04-09T13:50:29  <simonjb> and we've discussed migrating to Hugo or readthedocs, though we don't know when this might be
2019-04-09T13:51:04  <simonjb> thinking about our options here
2019-04-09T13:54:29  <alanharnum> simonjb: we could probably just stay on Node 8 for now - trying to get this all to work on Node 10 has been a rabbit hole
2019-04-09T13:55:11  <alanharnum> as you point out, we essentially just use it internally to generate a static site
2019-04-09T13:55:13  <colinclark> …a container or vagrant box set up with the appropriate older dependencies would make this a viable compromise, I imagine
2019-04-09T13:55:36  <alanharnum> colinclark: yes, we could implement a process using a builder container pinned on Node 8
2019-04-09T13:55:45  <colinclark> right
2019-04-09T13:56:16  <alanharnum> we do need a longer term strategy for moving off Docpad, as the project appears to be functionally dead
2019-04-09T13:57:01  <colinclark> yes
2019-04-09T13:57:19  <simonjb> maybe in the short/medium term, we manage by running with Node 8 with what works, rather than doing all the work to migrate to Node 10
2019-04-09T13:57:26  <colinclark> First step in that strategy is to avoid making new sites with Docpad, which we’re doing
2019-04-09T13:57:36  <colinclark> and then yep, simonjb’s point seems like step #2
2019-04-09T13:57:45  <colinclark> and then step 3 is to migrate existing sites off it
2019-04-09T13:58:00  <alanharnum> simonjb: yeah, I think the hope had been that this would be relatively straightforward, but it's not; one of those "each issue resolved surfaces a new one" situations
2019-04-09T13:58:08  <simonjb> yeah
2019-04-09T13:58:38  <colinclark> often there’s only one way to find that sort of thing out, which is to try it. so now we know :)
2019-04-09T13:59:00  <alanharnum> I suspect we can simply adapt prior work by gtirloni for a builder container pinned to Node 8: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/138/files
2019-04-09T14:00:48  <alanharnum> will look into this as priority rather than continuing to yak-shave on Node 10
2019-04-09T14:02:38  <simonjb> sounds good alanharnum

2019-04-09T17:08:56  <the-t-in-rtf> very good to know @alanharnum, I was starting research on static site searching earlier
2019-04-09T17:09:04  <the-t-in-rtf> I had thought docpad support was a plus
2019-04-09T17:09:38  <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess it's a plus in the short term
