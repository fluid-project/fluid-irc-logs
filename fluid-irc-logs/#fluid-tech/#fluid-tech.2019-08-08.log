2019-08-08T17:24:11  <cindyli> Bosmon: what's the best way to return a promise to push this call to the top level - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-4014-2/scripts/migration/schema-0.2-GPII-4014/createSimulatedGpiiKeys.js#L194 (and line 197), with the recursive call of this function itself at line 189? i've tried:
2019-08-08T17:24:18  <cindyli> 1. use fluid.promise.sequence() to sequence up promises generated by line 189 with the final togo promise. It didn't work: only the first promise from calling createRecursive at line 207 gets returned.
2019-08-08T17:26:02  <cindyli> 2. only call togo.resolve or togo.reject in the block of 192. but togo will still be returned too early that nothing gets resolved in its caller of gpii.migration.GPII4014.createKeys()

2019-08-08T18:58:07  <Bosmon> cindyli - did you mean deleteRecursive rather than createRecursive?
2019-08-08T18:58:33  <Bosmon> I guess they are both quite similar
2019-08-08T18:58:41  <cindyli> exactly
2019-08-08T18:59:07  <cindyli> they all have process.exit() called in the recursive function
2019-08-08T18:59:11  <Bosmon> cindyli - the problem is that neither of them actually return a promise
2019-08-08T18:59:34  <Bosmon> Rather than sticking "then" in the body, the recursion function should just append a promise to the sequence
2019-08-08T19:00:43  <cindyli> Bosmon: without "then", how can the next recursion know when to start?
2019-08-08T19:01:20  <cindyli> the recursions should follow each other
2019-08-08T19:01:58  <Bosmon> cindyli yes, ok, you must apply "then" but you must actually return a promise
2019-08-08T19:02:10  <Bosmon> And then a promise which chains its rejection to the one which you just constructed
2019-08-08T19:04:08  <Bosmon> The problem is that your current invocation of gpii.migration.GPII4014.createRecursive is unconnected to the promise calculus - it just gets invoked as a callback to "then"
2019-08-08T19:04:14  <cindyli> Bosmon: if i return a promise from this recursive function, the top caller always receives the first promise
2019-08-08T19:05:14  <Bosmon> cindyli - you don't return the first promise, you return the derived promise
2019-08-08T19:06:36  <Bosmon> Each function tacks its promise onto the head of the chain, and then you return whatever promise you derived by concatenating your new one with the work promise
2019-08-08T19:06:51  <Bosmon> And then all the "returns" bomb down the stack, ending up returning the most derived promise to the original caller
2019-08-08T19:07:25  <Bosmon> But, nonetheless, one which rejects as soon as there is any rejection
2019-08-08T19:08:16  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you mean this: derivedPromise === fluid.promise.sequence([recursion1Promise, recursion2Promiseâ€¦. donePromise])?
2019-08-08T19:08:34  <Bosmon> cindyli well in practice you don't need sequence since you only ever have 2 promises in your hands
2019-08-08T19:08:43  <Bosmon> You can just chain them together by hand
