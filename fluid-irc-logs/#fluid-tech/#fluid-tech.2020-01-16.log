2020-01-16T15:18:03  <clown> good morning cindyli
2020-01-16T15:18:10  <cindyli> hi clown
2020-01-16T15:18:51  <clown> I have a question:  I was thinking about using a kettle.dataSource as the means to access the gpii-version.json file.  But, it that overkill?
2020-01-16T15:19:04  <clown> *is that overkill?
2020-01-16T15:20:25  <clown> or is that too vague a question? :-)
2020-01-16T15:22:42  <cindyli> i would use content = require(fileName); or content = fs.readFileSync(fileName, "utf-8")
2020-01-16T15:23:21  <cindyli> the latter function ensures the file loading is a sync action
2020-01-16T15:24:39  <clown> I was thinking of doing that in the implementation of the data source's getImpl() function.  (I'm already doing something similar in my current code).
2020-01-16T15:26:54  <clown> maybe I should have been more specific:  use a kettle.dataSource.file component.
2020-01-16T15:30:20  <clown> if you want to see the current implementation:  https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/GPII-4273/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FullSHAGetHandler.js#L46
2020-01-16T15:34:09  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.120.225.182> has joined #fluid-tech
2020-01-16T15:35:23  <cindyli> clown: i think your current implementation is ok
2020-01-16T15:35:38  <clown> Cool…
2020-01-16T15:36:28  <clown> But, two things, cindyli:
2020-01-16T15:37:03  <clown> 1. The filename should really be something like "%gpii-unifersal/gpii-revision.json", and
2020-01-16T15:37:24  <clown> 2.  we were discussing yesterday about changing the file path to the json file using distributeOptions.   How does on do that with a simple string member?
2020-01-16T15:38:58  <cindyli> for 1, you can use fluid.module.resolvePath("%gpii-unifersal/gpii-revision.json") to expand this gpii special form to the absolution path
2020-01-16T15:40:21  <cindyli> for 2, i'm not sure if i understand your question. but i think the distributeOptions will distribute the full string of "%gpii-unifersal/gpii-revision.json", is there a problem with it?
2020-01-16T15:43:17  <cindyli> btw, clown, i feel the component name "gpii.flowManager.cloudBased.fullSHA" is unclear. would it be better to use something like "gitVersionFinder" or "commitHashRetriever"?
2020-01-16T15:44:28  <clown> I don't know if there is a problem with it — I haven't tried to use distributeOptions yet.  But, my understanding of distributeOptions is that it works on components, and this is a "member" and just  string.
2020-01-16T15:45:08  <clown> re:  names of things — thanks for the suggestions.  but, this code is still preliminary, and I'm changing the names hourly…
2020-01-16T15:45:24  <cindyli> lol
2020-01-16T15:46:23  <cindyli> i see. clown, for member options, you can set the distribution target to "{component}.options.members.fileName"
2020-01-16T15:46:36  <clown> I see — thanks!
2020-01-16T15:46:41  <cindyli> anytime
2020-01-16T15:47:19  <clown> and the name of the member is about to change to  "path" or "fullPath".
2020-01-16T15:47:26  <clown> ;-)
2020-01-16T15:47:30  <cindyli> :)

2020-01-16T15:53:22  <cindyli> clown: it just comes to me that the fileName in your component doesn't have to be a member option. it'll be set at the system start and won't change after that, so might make more sense for it to be a regular option
2020-01-16T15:55:22  <clown> cindyli:  what's a "regular option"?
2020-01-16T15:56:02  <cindyli> clown: one level up, outside of "members" block
