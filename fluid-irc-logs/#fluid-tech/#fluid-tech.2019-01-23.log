2019-01-23T14:13:27  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, Khalid, yes, although you should know that most of the people involved won't be coming online for a few minutes
2019-01-23T14:13:53  <the-t-in-rtf> also, you should use an IRC client that can take messages while you're offline, as you might get a response while you're not connected
2019-01-23T14:14:07  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, go ahead and ask, there are people here and in the other channel
2019-01-23T14:14:45  <the-t-in-rtf> @khalid, see above
2019-01-23T14:19:20  <khalid> ok I'm sorry my first time using irc but I will , I have read about fluid and i am interested in it specially about "builds Web tools" and I want to take part in your next project in gsoc but I don't howto start I have a good background in computer science fundamentals and a little in web development

2019-01-23T14:26:07  <the-t-in-rtf> no,  it's good, I just mention it because some students don't get to hear our answers because they're offline.
2019-01-23T14:26:16  <alanharnum> hi khalid - what information we've got so far for 2019 is at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2019+with+the+Fluid+Project - we're still in the process of deciding if we'll apply this year and won't know if we're an accepted organization until late February
2019-01-23T14:27:05  <alanharnum> I typically recommend everyone have a look at our beginner Infusion tutorial at https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-developerIntroduction/DeveloperIntroductionToInfusionFramework-OpeningRemarks.html - this is the Javascript framework we do most of our work with in the community
2019-01-23T14:27:59  <alanharnum> aside from a few specific projects, we are typically looking for students with a relatively high level of Javascript experience, as projects tend to be either browser-based or Node-based JS development

2019-01-23T14:34:24  <khalid> thank you, I took a look of links you sent I can start learning this framework and my js knowledge is not that high or low I currently improve my skills in it in react native i'm learning it now and i can learn node.js in parallel this won't be a problem at all for me so what else can I do?

We'll post information about them on that page when we know and they'll have more details about the desirable skills and technology.
2019-01-23T14:38:53  <alanharnum> The one other thing to do if you're interested in our community is to read about web accessibility, as that's often an important part of our projects
2019-01-23T14:39:28  <alanharnum> https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ is a good starting point
2019-01-23T14:39:58  <khalid> I'm higly intersted even if you don't get accepted at gsoc , I will start with it thanks for your time
2019-01-23T14:40:25  <alanharnum> you're welcome

2019-01-23T20:16:22  <simonjb> gmoss: I have a theory on SJRK-184 (while investigating and trying to reproduce the untranslated url issue)
2019-01-23T20:16:43  <simonjb> if the captured images all had the same filename, we would see this behaviour
2019-01-23T20:17:01  <simonjb> because we match block images to file uploads by filename
2019-01-23T20:17:02  <simonjb> https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/blob/learning-to-learn/src/js/requestHandlers.js#L142
2019-01-23T20:17:27  <simonjb> if they all had the name capture.jpeg for example
2019-01-23T20:18:06  <simonjb> and it's just the filename without any path information
2019-01-23T20:18:11  <gmoss> simonjb: yes, when they're uploaded to the server, they do all end up with the same filename stored in the database. What you're suggesting makes perfect sense
2019-01-23T20:18:40  <gmoss> I wonder how much of that is within our control, or what else we could do to circumvent this issue
2019-01-23T20:18:56  <gmoss> assuming this is the case
2019-01-23T20:20:07  <simonjb> at this point, I don't know enough, we'd need some way of differentiating and match them that was not just filename
2019-01-23T20:21:15  <simonjb> I'll add a comment to SJRK-184
2019-01-23T20:21:20  <simonjb> gmoss ^
2019-01-23T20:21:23  <gmoss> great, thanks simonjb :)
2019-01-23T20:22:01  <simonjb> gmoss: I've not yet been able to reproduce the untranslated URL issue, but it definitely happened :(
2019-01-23T20:22:35  <gmoss> simonjb: yeah it's so curious... i really hope we can reproduce it and solve it before it manifests itself during a session
2019-01-23T20:23:09  <gmoss> i think sepi's intention to have people compile their stories before entering them in the tool should help with alleviate the problem
2019-01-23T20:23:33  <simonjb> yes

2019-01-23T20:48:56  <gmoss> simonjb: I don't recall what it said in the blob URLs while i was debugging on the iPad, but once they get published the image URL is the new uuid format as they're stored in the db, but each captured image has the same URL
2019-01-23T20:50:25  <simonjb> gmoss: it would be if the originalnames were the same

2019-01-23T20:52:47  <gmoss> to confirm this
2019-01-23T20:54:31  <simonjb> gmoss: not a big rush, as we have a workaround, but if it's convenient some time to check and see if the theory is good -- I have verified that we see the behaviour by uploading 2 different images with the same name (from different directoried)
2019-01-23T20:54:49  <simonjb> directories

2019-01-23T21:51:13  <gmoss> will have to look into that
2019-01-23T21:51:33  <gmoss> simonjb: btw, I've spoke with alanharnum about our server questions and added notes to our task list
2019-01-23T21:51:41  <simonjb> it's because block.fileDetails is null
2019-01-23T21:51:55  <simonjb> so block.fileDetails.name fails
2019-01-23T21:51:59  <gmoss> ah, null ref exceptionm
2019-01-23T21:52:01  <simonjb> gmoss ^
2019-01-23T21:52:04  <simonjb> yes
2019-01-23T21:52:05  <gmoss> makes sense
2019-01-23T21:52:11  <simonjb> it's a small fix
2019-01-23T21:52:23  <gmoss> mhmm
2019-01-23T21:52:47  <simonjb> though I'm looking at this code in more detail now and it's misleading that it's using fluid.transform
2019-01-23T21:52:57  <simonjb> and it doesn't use the results at all
2019-01-23T21:53:05  <simonjb> it iterates and modified in place
2019-01-23T21:53:28  <simonjb> the "return block;" statement does nothing as the return is ignored
2019-01-23T21:53:33  <gmoss> ah, yes, is that not appropriate usage of fluid.transform?
2019-01-23T21:53:38  <simonjb> no
2019-01-23T21:54:04  <simonjb> fluid.each would be better

2019-01-23T22:06:18  <simonjb> what about when the server code is deployed?
2019-01-23T22:06:37  <gmoss> simonjb: if it's just the CI job rebuilding the containers, the db and files are persisted
2019-01-23T22:06:52  <gmoss> if i correctly understood what alanharnum was saying
2019-01-23T22:07:01  <gmoss> as those things are mapped to folders on the host machien\
2019-01-23T22:07:02  <gmoss> *machine
2019-01-23T22:07:11  <gmoss> the reset job clears those folders out
2019-01-23T22:07:14  <simonjb> great, could you add a comment to that effect? and please clarify, as it's pretty important to know this for sure
2019-01-23T22:07:30  <gmoss> sure, I think i mention it elsewhere but meant to finish writing something and got distracted
2019-01-23T22:07:34  <gmoss> i'll do that now simonjb

2019-01-23T22:19:58  <alanharnum> if we're looking for assurance, the Karisma Stories site gets its containers rebuilt nightly, and has persisted its contents since the Colombia trip
2019-01-23T22:20:00  <simonjb> awesome, thanks alanharnum
2019-01-23T22:20:52  <alanharnum> and it uses the same configuration as the FLOE Stories site - the only difference is the FLOE Stories site has the clean-up job that runs nightly and removes the bind mount directories.

2019-01-23T23:29:19  <sgithens> I don't know how much it really helps
2019-01-23T23:29:32  <sgithens> but it's always been around as a thing to do
2019-01-23T23:30:06  <avtar> sgithens: i don't think that needs to be done anymore
2019-01-23T23:31:12  <avtar> they don't even mention it https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/
2019-01-23T23:32:00  <sgithens> avtar: cool thanks for the input!
2019-01-23T23:32:02  <avtar> this they do mention though: "Do not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life."
2019-01-23T23:32:47  <sgithens> what the heck?
2019-01-23T23:33:04  <sgithens> so during the work day are you just supposed to constatnly plug it in and out?
2019-01-23T23:33:06  <avtar> :genius-shrugging:
2019-01-23T23:33:28  <avtar> no
2019-01-23T23:34:07  <avtar> i think the above applies for when you're not going to use your device for an extended period of time
2019-01-23T23:34:23  <avtar> which in our case is never the case so no need to worry
2019-01-23T23:34:24  <sgithens> oh I see now down the page
2019-01-23T23:34:58  <sgithens> thanks
2019-01-23T23:35:01  <avtar> np
