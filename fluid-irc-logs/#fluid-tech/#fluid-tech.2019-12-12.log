2019-12-12T16:32:26  <cindyli> gmoss: I'm trying the language change with your branch https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/tree/SJRK-255 and it seems working. what I did was using the default theme by setting

2019-12-12T17:44:28  <gmoss> cindyli: the issues that I was experiencing were related to uio and the table of contents header. The language change is working (slower than before, mind you), but if the uio panel is open it will close itself on the language change since we're recreating the separatedPanel component in order to get the text on the tab to update. Another thing is that the table of contents header doesn't always set properly and is
2019-12-12T17:44:29  <gmoss> sometimes an object instead of a string, so there's a race condition there. And beyond that, the issues that are keeping the browser tests from passing
2019-12-12T17:47:08  <cindyli> gmoss: what's the right behaviour for the uio panel when it's open at the language change? it shouldn't close itself?
2019-12-12T17:47:52  <gmoss> cindyli: that's correct, the panels should update without the sliding panel closing. That's what it used to do
2019-12-12T17:48:43  <cindyli> ok. thanks
