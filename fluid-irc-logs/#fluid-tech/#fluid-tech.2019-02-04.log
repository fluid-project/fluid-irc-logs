2019-02-04T18:02:26  <gmoss> simonjb: everything in your SJRK-205 branch looks great, though I noticed a pretty minor typo in the readme on this line: https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling-server/compare/SJRK-205...simonbates:SJRK-205#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R53
2019-02-04T18:02:58  <gmoss> "this is a idempotent operation" --> "this is an ..."
2019-02-04T18:03:14  <simonjb> ah, yes
2019-02-04T18:03:43  <gmoss> i'm going to clone it now and make sure the node tests pass
2019-02-04T18:03:53  <simonjb> ok, cool
2019-02-04T18:03:57  <simonjb> thanks
2019-02-04T18:04:24  <simonjb> I'll leave the typo as is, and make a separate PR for it
2019-02-04T18:04:29  <gmoss> okay
2019-02-04T18:10:14  <gmoss> looks good :)
2019-02-04T18:10:27  <simonjb> awesome, thanks gmoss! good to merge?
2019-02-04T18:11:21  <gmoss> well I think it would be good to test out the server config, ideally, but that will take some time to set up. my preference, considering we have a backup and we're pressed for time, would be to do the cowboy approach in this case and test in production
2019-02-04T18:11:31  <gmoss> *it would take time to set up locally, that is
2019-02-04T18:11:54  <simonjb> ok, merging now...

2019-02-04T18:22:23  <alanharnum> gmoss simonjb: looks like the deploy occured no problem, and I can see the host volume directory for deleted_uploads has been successfully created
2019-02-04T18:22:42  <simonjb> that's great, thanks alanharnum
2019-02-04T18:22:57  <simonjb> michelled: ^
2019-02-04T18:22:59  <gmoss> alanharnum: great! I'll be doing some testing based on our test grid, now
2019-02-04T18:23:22  <alanharnum> i suspect the main thing i'll need to confirm is that files appear in deleted_uploads when a story is deleted
2019-02-04T18:23:40  <alanharnum> so let me know when you hit the point that would happen
2019-02-04T18:24:13  <michelled> I guess we'd also want to make sure that those files aren't still in the original place

2019-02-04T19:09:31  <gmoss> alanharnum: about to start deleting some stories. Is there a way for me to see what's in the host folder, or would I rely on you or someone else with permissions to check for me?
2019-02-04T19:10:02  <alanharnum> gmoss: unfortunately not an easy way for me to give you access quickly, so you'll need to rely on me
2019-02-04T19:11:02  <gmoss> alanharnum: okay, let me count the number of files I expect to be moved to the recovery folder
2019-02-04T19:11:20  <gmoss> and then I'll let you know when I'm done deleting those test stories
2019-02-04T19:11:29  <alanharnum> gmoss: OK
2019-02-04T19:19:41  <gmoss> alanharnum: I've deleted my test stories (13 of them) and there should be 21 files in the folder
2019-02-04T19:19:46  <gmoss> could you please confirm?
2019-02-04T19:19:47  <gmoss> :)
2019-02-04T19:20:48  <alanharnum> gmoss: confirmed
2019-02-04T19:21:04  <gmoss> alanharnum: awesome. I have also confirmed that none of the media from the previous stories is broken
2019-02-04T19:21:12  <gmoss> *is = are
2019-02-04T19:21:32  <simonjb> alanharnum: and the deleted files are no longer in uploads?
2019-02-04T19:22:06  <alanharnum> simonjb gmoss: there's only five files in uploads/ now, which are the ones that were there before gmoss started his tests
2019-02-04T19:22:14  <gmoss> excellent alanharnum
2019-02-04T19:22:18  <simonjb> great
2019-02-04T19:23:07  <gmoss> simonjb alanharnum: I'll attempt to upload a story without a matching file, now, to test our saving changes
2019-02-04T19:23:15  <simonjb> thanks gmoss
