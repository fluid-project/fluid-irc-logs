2019-11-18T15:27:16  <christopher> Hello stegru, quick question on ffi-napi over on the Windows side.
2019-11-18T15:27:28  <stegru> yes?
2019-11-18T15:27:32  <christopher> I'm running into stability issues with ffi-napi's "ffi.Callback" and "ffi.Function" features.

2019-11-18T15:27:42  <christopher> Have you used ffi-napi callbacks before?
2019-11-18T15:27:47  <christopher> Hello hello :)
2019-11-18T15:27:48  <stegru> yes..
2019-11-18T15:27:57  <christopher> Are we using them currently in gpii-windows?
2019-11-18T15:28:05  <christopher> I'm getting intermittent segfaults with callbacks.
2019-11-18T15:28:29  *** the-t-in-rtf <the-t-in-rtf!~Adium@212.123.218.234> has joined #fluid-tech
2019-11-18T15:28:36  <christopher> I know that ffi-napi has to copy the payload of the callback, queue it up for the main thread, and then call the actual JS code on the main node thread.
2019-11-18T15:28:58  <christopher> I also know that the ffi project says "it's all thread safe; no worries!" and the ffi-napi project says "no, not thread safe...there be sharks."
2019-11-18T15:29:56  <christopher> I got rid of my payload arguments so that the callbacks are just pure ffi function pointers (void return arg, void params), and I'm still getting segfaults.  Sometimes the segfaults are in the process address range of node, and sometimes they're like "0x0000047" which is definitely wrong.  It's really weird and random.  And it's an intermittent failure.
2019-11-18T15:29:57  <stegru> here's one example: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/windowsMetrics/src/windowsMetrics.js#L679-L679
2019-11-18T15:30:06  <christopher> Okay, let me go see really quickly.
2019-11-18T15:30:34  <christopher> I even saved references to the ffi.Callback and ffi.Function instances in the "global" node variable, just to make sure it wasn't a GC issue.
2019-11-18T15:31:20  <stegru> heres' the callback definition: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms644985(v%3Dvs.85)
2019-11-18T15:31:37  <christopher> Hmm, yes, I see.
2019-11-18T15:31:49  <christopher> Have we had any intermittent crashes or problems with it?
2019-11-18T15:31:55  <christopher> I wonder if it's Mac-specific.
2019-11-18T15:32:04  <stegru> no, not that I'm aware of
2019-11-18T15:32:42  <christopher> Hmm, okay.  Thank you.
2019-11-18T15:32:45  <stegru> this particular callback gets invoked whenever the mouse or keyboard is used.. so it's probably the mostly used code
2019-11-18T15:32:52  <christopher> Yeah, for sure.
2019-11-18T15:33:38  <stegru> another example: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/windowMessages/src/windowMessages.js#L219-L219
2019-11-18T15:34:58  <stegru> I've had random ffi crashes due to using wrongly sized buffers
2019-11-18T15:35:18  <christopher> A dangerous world :)
2019-11-18T15:35:21  <stegru> usually crashing in unrelated parts
2019-11-18T15:35:25  <christopher> Ugh.
2019-11-18T15:35:35  <christopher> Have you dealt with passing data via callbacks as pointers?
2019-11-18T15:35:48  <christopher> And the finalization/cleanup requirements that go with deallocating those objects from the heap?
2019-11-18T15:36:42  <stegru> well, if i did, then I'd just keep a global reference until i knew it was finished with
2019-11-18T15:36:49  <christopher> Gotcha.
2019-11-18T15:37:06  <christopher> Okay.  I'm going to debug down into napi and see if I can figure out what's going on.
2019-11-18T15:37:22  <christopher> The weird thing is that I generally don't get any crashes when the ffi-napi callbacks are running within node...
2019-11-18T15:37:42  <christopher> But once Electron renames the primary thread (to Browser or whatever it's called) and takes over...things get very crashy very quickly.
2019-11-18T15:37:48  <christopher> I'm wondering if there's some state getting lost.
2019-11-18T15:37:50  <christopher> In any case...
2019-11-18T15:37:52  <christopher> I'll keep digging.
2019-11-18T15:37:55  <christopher> Thank you for the insights!
2019-11-18T15:38:03  <stegru> that's ok
