2019-01-15T18:05:07  <cindyli> Bosmon: i ran all-tests.js again in the linux VM and hit the exactly same result as earlier: all passed at the first time; hit the exactly same "No space left on device" error at the second run. overall, i didn't successfully reproduced the GPII-3636 issue. As you hit the 3636 issue constantly, wonder if it's ok i tell you how to change the debounce time in the test and you do some experiment to find out what debounce time slot is lo
2019-01-15T18:05:07  <cindyli> ng enough to satisfy your VM?
2019-01-15T18:05:51  <cindyli> 2 steps to change debounce time for node tests:
2019-01-15T18:06:14  <cindyli> 1. increase the value 3000 to for example 4000
2019-01-15T18:06:50  <cindyli> 2. replace all appearance of the value "3500" in the code to a value that is greater than 4000, for example: 4100
2019-01-15T18:07:04  <cindyli> that's it
2019-01-15T18:08:44  <cindyli> the trick is the value set in step 2 must be bigger than the value set in step 1, so that after sending the first proximityTriggered request, the test wait long it to pass the debounce time rule before sending the second proximityTriggered

2019-01-15T18:10:46  <Bosmon> cindyli - I wonder if we can work out what the failure mode actually is
2019-01-15T18:11:03  <Bosmon> And whether the issue is that the test timeout isn't big enough relative to the proximity timeout
2019-01-15T18:11:11  <Bosmon> Or whether it is that the proximity timeout is too small

2019-01-15T18:18:00  <cindyli> Bosmon: i suspect the failure might be from this line of debounce timeout wait: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/shared/UserLogonHandlersTestDefs.js#L214-L215
2019-01-15T18:18:12  <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks, I'll give it a try
2019-01-15T18:18:39  <cindyli> it's supposed to wait a short time to have the next proximityTrigger request rejected
2019-01-15T18:19:09  <cindyli> but the test run might be too slow that when the test reaches the event at line 223, 3000 has passed
2019-01-15T18:19:22  <cindyli> so the next request was accepted instead of being rejected
2019-01-15T18:21:03  <Bosmon> cindyli - it's interesting that I can't see the sequence element in my JIRA in this file ...
2019-01-15T18:21:28  <cindyli> increasing the debounce time is to accommodate this slowness that varies from system to system
2019-01-15T18:21:58  <cindyli> the jira says "at sequence pos 14 of 18 sequence element"
2019-01-15T18:22:09  <cindyli> i will be back in half an hour
2019-01-15T18:22:19  <Bosmon> The name agrees with the sequence at line 329
2019-01-15T18:22:27  <Bosmon> I'll try tinkering with the timeout in that one
2019-01-15T18:23:31  <Bosmon> Ah I am in the wrong file
2019-01-15T18:24:11  <Bosmon> Well this is crazy, in this sequence there is a timeout of 100 ms!

2019-01-15T19:39:55  <cindyli> Bosmon: how is it going with the test?
2019-01-15T19:41:06  <Bosmon> cindyli - I've been having dinner instead
2019-01-15T19:41:10  <Bosmon> But I think the failure mode is pretty clear
2019-01-15T19:41:28  <Bosmon> This test fixture attempts to pause for 100ms, and then there is no doubt a huge GC pause of > 3 seconds
2019-01-15T19:42:14  <cindyli> exactly same suspect here
2019-01-15T19:42:44  <Bosmon> The test then fails since it is expecting the debounce failure notification which never comes
2019-01-15T19:42:46  <cindyli> hope you've proved this is the cause
2019-01-15T19:43:57  <Bosmon> cindyli - how could I prove it :)
2019-01-15T19:44:28  <Bosmon> We can try increasing the timeout and see if the issue goes away
2019-01-15T19:44:40  <cindyli> exactly
2019-01-15T19:44:46  <Bosmon> But in general it is largely impossible to "prove" the cause of something not happening
2019-01-15T19:45:06  <Bosmon> Yes, unfortunately this means changing the timeouts throughout this file,e tc.
2019-01-15T19:45:17  <cindyli> right
2019-01-15T19:45:45  <cindyli> throughout every test file actually if you were running all-tests. there are 3 of them
2019-01-15T19:46:02  <Bosmon> Indeed
2019-01-15T19:46:11  <Bosmon> I don't think I have time for this at this point before going out to the cinema
2019-01-15T19:46:22  <cindyli> haha, enjoy the movie

2019-01-15T20:09:14  <colinclark> I wanted to hide my "Add Video" button in the case that a video has been successfully added to a layer
2019-01-15T20:09:44  <colinclark> so I think I'm on the verge of lensing the video's URL—which is either undefined or a string URL—into the button's isHidden model boolean
