2020-07-28T16:52:24  <gtirloni> List of interesting GH Actions features that are in progress (from GitHub's public roadmap).. for anyone interested in CI/CD -- https://gist.github.com/gtirloni/07b7117cef0bc5060855212c90a9a241
2020-07-28T20:12:27  <sbates> gtirloni: for GitHub Actions, I'd love to see some convenient mechanism for static hosting of web content built during a GitHub workflow. Such as designating a directory as a web content output directory, and at the end of the job, the contents of that directory are served. GitHub Pages predates Actions and doesn't fit in any convenient manner
2020-07-28T20:13:30  <sbates> similar to how Netlify works, but within GitHub. they offer GitHub Pages static hosting but something integrated with Actions would be really good
2020-07-28T20:26:36  <gtirloni> that's a nice idea and, indeed, they don't integrate well today. you have to create a token, call git, etc, not very convenient. it might be worth posting it here: https://support.github.com/contact/feedback
2020-07-28T20:30:17  <sbates> yeah, that's a good idea to offer feedback -- it's something that I just assumed that they would have thought of and are either working on or decided not to. but providing feedback in case it helps is a really good idea
2020-07-28T20:42:35  <sbates> gtirloni: feedback sent :)
