2020-10-15T20:12:25  <philip> Hey cindyli, I want to push the data-update stuff to a repo in the inclusive-design org, but I don't have the right to create repositories there
2020-10-15T20:13:24  <philip> Can you make one? I've named it data-update-github locally, though I don't think it's the most informative name
2020-10-15T20:13:28  <cindyli> philip: i can create a repo in there
2020-10-15T20:13:47  <cindyli> what name should we use
2020-10-15T20:14:41  <philip> cindyli: data-update-github, unless you have a better suggestion. Or maybe Bosmon does?
2020-10-15T20:16:04  <cindyli> philip: i'm not good at names too. let's use data-update-github first and modify later if someone comes up with a better name
2020-10-15T20:16:18  <philip> cindyli: sounds good :)
2020-10-15T20:19:08  <cindyli> philip: here it is - https://github.com/inclusive-design/data-update-github/blob/main/README.md
2020-10-15T20:19:18  <cindyli> well https://github.com/inclusive-design/data-update-github
2020-10-15T20:21:10  <philip> ok, what I've scratched together based on today's tech checkin is at https://github.com/ptcher/data-update-github
2020-10-15T20:22:16  <philip> cindyli: Do you have time to talk through it in the We Count room?
2020-10-15T20:23:52  <cindyli> philip: sure, can we meet in 5 mins. i'm finishing up a pull request soon
2020-10-15T20:29:42  <cindyli> philip: i'm ready to meet whenever you are
