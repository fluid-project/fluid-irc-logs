2019-01-24T17:04:26  <clown> cindyli:  do you have time for that problem I mentioned at standup?
2019-01-24T17:15:47  <simonjb> gmoss, michelled: I have an idea for our deletion code -- how about we do something similar to desktop GUIs and email clients, and make a directory "trash" or such that isn't served up on the internet. We move files there rather that deleting. That way, we can recover if we need to.
2019-01-24T17:16:24  <michelled> simonjb: that's a good idea
2019-01-24T17:16:56  <simonjb> "deleted_uploads" maybe
2019-01-24T17:18:01  <cindyli> sorry, clown, just saw your message. yes.
2019-01-24T17:19:40  <clown> no problem, cindyli.  There may be a quick answer
2019-01-24T17:20:00  <clown> can one have a gpiiKey with no corresponding prefsSafe (not even an emtpy one)
2019-01-24T17:20:01  <clown> ?
2019-01-24T17:20:33  <clown> is that scenario allowed?
2019-01-24T17:20:45  <cindyli> yes, gpiiKey.prefsSafeId could be null
2019-01-24T17:21:16  <clown> ah, that may be my problem.  I have it set to "prefsSafe-chrome_and_firefox"
2019-01-24T17:21:43  <clown> but no actual prefs safe with that id in couch
2019-01-24T17:21:51  <cindyli> ok
2019-01-24T17:21:58  <gmoss> simonjb: an interesting idea! I'm a little wary of preserving those files, since it's possible they'll be things we want to get rid of permanently ASAP, and moving them to another folder would require us to go in and clean it up every so often (or to set up a job that does that). I'm not saying no, of course! only that I'm not sure :)
2019-01-24T17:22:14  <clown> I'll try setting the prefsSafeId to null and see if that fixed things.
2019-01-24T17:22:23  <cindyli> ok
2019-01-24T17:26:08  <clown> nope, I still get the same failure, cindyli
2019-01-24T17:26:43  <clown> "Cannot find the GPII key "chrome_and_firefox" while executing HTTP PUT on url http://preferences:9081/preferences/%gpiiKey?merge=%merge"
2019-01-24T17:27:38  <clown> This is for the test case that attempts to update "chrome_and_firefox" preferences where it has no prefsSafe to begin with.
2019-01-24T17:28:03  <cindyli> there's one issue that the-t-in-rtf found with using couchdb, which might be related. let me dig out
2019-01-24T17:28:20  <clown> sure.
2019-01-24T17:29:00  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, any view that emits an object with a non-existent _id will return null rather than an empty object merged with whatever else you emit
2019-01-24T17:29:11  <clown> jhernandez, javjarfer[m]  FYI:  a fire truck just drove by the building with its siren/buzzer going strong.
2019-01-24T17:29:16  <the-t-in-rtf> PouchDB lets you get away with it, CouchDB doesn't
2019-01-24T17:30:10  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3628
2019-01-24T17:30:13  <javjarfer[m]> clown: it's time for you to reveal you secret identity
2019-01-24T17:30:30  <clown> thanks the-t-in-rtf.  That suggests that the test definition cannot be shared in the two scenarios.  Or, that the expected outcome be redefined to use just the couch case since you are removing pouch.
2019-01-24T17:31:35  <cindyli> cool. thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2019-01-24T17:32:32  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  ignore my previous "solution".  I'll update the _design/views to use the one suggested in the JIRA
2019-01-24T17:33:14  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:   re: your comment "My strong suspicion is that we would eventually have encountered problems in production related to this, assuming there are any use cases in which we have a key that isn't associated with a preferences safe."
2019-01-24T17:33:24  <clown> Yup, that time has arrivedâ€¦
2019-01-24T17:33:49  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: as to the solution you suggested in the jira, did you try it with pouch?
2019-01-24T17:34:22  <cindyli> thinking we might find a solution that works for both
2019-01-24T17:35:32  <clown> cindyli:  I can test that in the current situation.  Everytime I make a change to the "developement" tests to work with a "production" configuration, I re-run them in a "developement" config to make sure I didn't break anything.
2019-01-24T17:35:50  <cindyli> cool. thanks, clown
2019-01-24T17:36:42  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  is that change to "findPrefsSafeByGpiiKey" in a pull request that I can cherry pick?  Or, shall I just copy and paste from the JIRA?
2019-01-24T17:37:45  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, delivery
2019-01-24T17:37:50  <the-t-in-rtf> I was just finding a link to the commit
2019-01-24T17:37:52  <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2019-01-24T17:38:15  <the-t-in-rtf> doesn't get any cleaner than that: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/728/commits/91ffd07bbdd5023b7a71faea24dee3f09a723cc9
2019-01-24T17:38:20  <the-t-in-rtf> it's just the fix, and for all three views
2019-01-24T17:38:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I searched the whole repo for additional affected views, those were the only three I found
2019-01-24T17:38:55  <the-t-in-rtf> the solution does work with pouch as far as I know
2019-01-24T17:39:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I expressly made sure to emit the rest of the material either way.
2019-01-24T17:39:28  <the-t-in-rtf> So with Pouch you'll still get the non-prefssafe material as expected
2019-01-24T17:40:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I manually tested it with Pouch while developing the fix.
2019-01-24T17:41:18  <clown> thanks the-t-in-rtf
2019-01-24T17:43:57  <jhernandez> clown: heh, glad to hear that they're still there :P
2019-01-24T17:44:14  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: quick question, after your last updates to JAWS ...
2019-01-24T17:44:26  <jhernandez> does this prefsSet looks "good" to you? https://preferences.prd.gcp.gpii.net/preferences/129bc341-0025-417e-8107-cb567ab419d0
2019-01-24T17:46:15  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, eventually I will make a quick function we can use to answer that question automatically.
2019-01-24T17:46:22  <the-t-in-rtf> for now, I say, it seems plausible
2019-01-24T17:46:26  <the-t-in-rtf> my only question is the language stuff
2019-01-24T17:46:37  <the-t-in-rtf> just a moment, let me look at the enum and enumLabels for those
2019-01-24T17:47:06  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: okay
2019-01-24T17:48:28  <jhernandez> FYI, we're putting a demo build for next week and we found out that we don't have any other prefsSet than "jaws", which isn't very helpful for demo
2019-01-24T17:49:21  <the-t-in-rtf> based on the transforms, it seems legit, but let me check the later pulls that I believe fleshed that out
2019-01-24T17:50:26  <jhernandez> in the sense that, when demoing, is great to see that, i.e., the synth has changed and is even using a different language
2019-01-24T17:50:39  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: cool, thanks
2019-01-24T17:50:48  <the-t-in-rtf> no, I didn't break it down further
2019-01-24T17:51:05  <the-t-in-rtf> so those values seem as sane as any
2019-01-24T17:52:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I think  you might be able to just set ENU-Global.SynthLangString in your test prefs set
2019-01-24T17:52:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I think that changes everything, the others are opt-outs for individual types of announcements
2019-01-24T18:11:58  *** avtar <avtar!~avtar@ip-24-50-160-101.user.start.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-01-24T18:16:18  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  that new view fixed my problem.  Works equally using development and production configurations (pouch vs couch, respecitvely)
2019-01-24T18:16:23  <clown> cindyli ^
2019-01-24T18:17:04  <the-t-in-rtf> that's good to hear
2019-01-24T18:17:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I designed it with that in mind, but had only tested it locally
2019-01-24T18:18:58  <clown> to be clear:  the "production" configuration I'm using is four docker containers:  flowmanage, preferences server, couchdb, and a container to run the tests in.
2019-01-24T18:19:23  <cindyli> cheers
2019-01-24T18:20:13  <clown> And now that I've seen your PR, the-t-in-rtf, I see we are changing the same files in some cases.  I see a merge issue in my future.  C'est la vie!
2019-01-24T18:22:45  <the-t-in-rtf> full fathom five universal master lies

2019-01-24T18:23:37  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, it's not that dramatic
2019-01-24T18:23:48  <clown> but are there sea nymphs?  that's important
2019-01-24T18:23:49  <the-t-in-rtf> but yes, there will be a bit of a dance

2019-01-24T18:44:52  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: okay, will try later
2019-01-24T19:05:52  <simonjb> gmoss, michelled: I just had https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-199 happen again while testing SJRK-191
2019-01-24T19:06:11  <simonjb> the preview was good, but when I published the files were missing
2019-01-24T19:06:30  <gmoss> simonjb: curious. did you notice anything in particular about the timing?
2019-01-24T19:06:36  <simonjb> no
2019-01-24T19:06:48  <simonjb> the files aren't in the uploads directory
2019-01-24T19:07:51  <simonjb> all was looking good in the preview, I was able to play audio and video
2019-01-24T19:08:16  <gmoss> hmm...
2019-01-24T19:10:57  <gmoss> simonjb: what environment are you running the server app in? just node in the command line? I might suggest using VS Code's debugger... this is going to be a tedious process without a reliable way to reproduce the issue, mind you
2019-01-24T19:13:50  <simonjb> gmoss: yes, command line on Windows
2019-01-24T19:14:24  <simonjb> michelled: I'm thinking that this is worth spending some time investigating -- what do you think?
2019-01-24T19:14:48  <michelled> yes, that makes sense to me
2019-01-24T19:15:03  <simonjb> ok, thanks michelled

2019-01-24T19:44:38  <jhernandez> will let you know how it goes
2019-01-24T19:44:41  <jhernandez> ;)
2019-01-24T19:51:59  <simonjb> gmoss, michelled1: I figured out how to reproduce -- it's the language switching https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-199?focusedCommentId=40359&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40359
2019-01-24T19:52:33  <gmoss> simonjb: that's good news!
2019-01-24T19:52:38  <gmoss> awesome :)
2019-01-24T19:52:55  <simonjb> I'll update the jira title
2019-01-24T19:54:32  <michelled1> oh wow, I wonder why that is
2019-01-24T19:55:36  <simonjb> I suspect that we switch templates and that replaces the file dom elements
2019-01-24T19:55:45  <simonjb> gmoss ^ ?
2019-01-24T19:58:55  <simonjb> michelled1: what do you think of addresses SJRK-199 in some way in terms of priority? it's near the very bottom now
2019-01-24T19:59:15  <simonjb> a fix might be in the short term to remove language switching?
2019-01-24T19:59:52  <michelled1> that seems like a good short term fix
2019-01-24T20:00:13  <michelled1> since we don't expect spanish language speakers in these rounds of storytelling events
2019-01-24T20:00:15  <gmoss> simonjb: that would do it. switching languages redraws the dynamic view components, i.e. creates fresh ones
2019-01-24T20:00:33  <gmoss> I agree with the short term fix
