2019-12-10T09:12:02  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], did you arrange a time to talk yet?
2019-12-10T10:03:05  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru and @bosmon, just reviewing the error message Kavya saw again
2019-12-10T10:03:10  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/secure/attachment/24404/24404_log-2019-12-06T144809.711Z.txt
2019-12-10T10:03:42  <the-t-in-rtf> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/language": "pl-PL"
2019-12-10T10:03:55  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the value that was passed to the flow manager and rejected
2019-12-10T10:04:13  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, your gist lowercased all of the keys
2019-12-10T10:04:14  <the-t-in-rtf> https://gist.github.com/stegru/050bc8c86704f388090f4c13022569e3
2019-12-10T10:04:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume I should preserve the case from the MS document instead of lowercasing them
2019-12-10T10:05:03  <the-t-in-rtf> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/available-language-packs-for-windows
2019-12-10T10:10:15  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf:  I'm available the whole morning
2019-12-10T10:10:29  <javjarfer[m]> whenever Bosmon and you feel like it's a good time for you
2019-12-10T10:10:57  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, mainly we need to see when @bosmon is available
2019-12-10T10:11:12  <the-t-in-rtf> his morning parental responsibilities end an hour later than my own, he may still be busy
2019-12-10T10:14:34  <stegru> it's case insensitive, the-t-in-rtf - also, I didn't use that list; my list is from the langauge pack files I have ...
2019-12-10T10:15:00  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but the QSS tried to pass it with the case
2019-12-10T10:15:33  <the-t-in-rtf> so I assume that it's safe to define the schema with the case and have you ignore it
2019-12-10T10:15:42  <the-t-in-rtf> rather than ignoring it in the schema
2019-12-10T10:16:07  <stegru> yes, if you like
2019-12-10T10:16:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I'd rather not have to push a change all the way through to the QSS if we can help it
2019-12-10T10:16:24  <the-t-in-rtf> so, yes, I like
2019-12-10T10:16:44  <the-t-in-rtf> :P
2019-12-10T10:17:06  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks for confirming
2019-12-10T10:17:52  <stegru> would you like a list with the correct case?
2019-12-10T10:18:13  <the-t-in-rtf> nah
2019-12-10T10:18:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I already created one
2019-12-10T10:18:37  <the-t-in-rtf> I also need the descriptions, so I just scraped and munged the contents of the MS list
2019-12-10T10:18:59  <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise I'm here all day looking up descriptions on that page anyway
2019-12-10T10:19:21  <the-t-in-rtf> on the plus side we will be able to support Cherokee when I'm done
2019-12-10T10:19:23  <stegru> ok great
2019-12-10T10:30:50  <the-t-in-rtf> So, next question.
2019-12-10T10:30:59  <the-t-in-rtf> The default for common/language is currently "en"
2019-12-10T10:31:05  <the-t-in-rtf> which isn't an option
2019-12-10T10:31:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume we're not doing any kind of locale/language failover and that I should just make that "en-US"
2019-12-10T10:32:02  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, @bosmon?
2019-12-10T10:32:33  <stegru> where does "en" come from?
2019-12-10T10:32:43  <the-t-in-rtf> how the F should I know
2019-12-10T10:32:45  <stegru> i mean, what is making it the default?
2019-12-10T10:32:49  <stegru> oh ok ha
2019-12-10T10:32:59  <the-t-in-rtf> seriously, I think it was aspirational, left over from earlier cross-platform work?
2019-12-10T10:33:33  <the-t-in-rtf> it's just defined as the default for common/language in the schema
2019-12-10T10:33:40  <stegru> maybe having a fixed list of languages isn't the right way to go... "en" is a valid language code
2019-12-10T10:33:59  <the-t-in-rtf> sure
2019-12-10T10:34:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I could add the non-locale variants without too much difficulty
2019-12-10T10:34:35  <the-t-in-rtf> but we have to have something
2019-12-10T10:34:48  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, a schema can't be programmed to check anything other than a list
2019-12-10T10:35:08  <the-t-in-rtf> so we could agree that any old nonsense is allowed, or we make a list
2019-12-10T10:35:14  <stegru> ahh ok!
2019-12-10T10:35:30  <the-t-in-rtf> eventually the "common" variant should be based on a standard with a mapping to/from what windows provides
2019-12-10T10:35:48  <the-t-in-rtf> and each platform will have its own language setting that's transformed to/from the common settings
2019-12-10T10:35:57  <stegru> yes
2019-12-10T10:36:39  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'm not agreeing to tackle that just now
2019-12-10T10:37:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I left a good TODO in the neighbourhood
2019-12-10T10:37:13  <stegru> so is the "en" coming from us?
2019-12-10T10:37:20  <stegru> (us, not "the US")
2019-12-10T10:37:21  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-12-10T10:37:23  <stegru> ok
2019-12-10T10:37:25  <the-t-in-rtf> and ha
2019-12-10T10:37:57  <the-t-in-rtf> So, just to confirm, you can ask windows to set the language to "en"?
2019-12-10T10:38:20  <the-t-in-rtf> second question, would the QSS ever make it possible to do so?
2019-12-10T10:38:45  <the-t-in-rtf> if the answer to the second is "no", I'd argue for leaving out the shorter variants for now
2019-12-10T10:39:04  <the-t-in-rtf> until I refactor enum/enumLabels, it's really awful managing a list of this size
2019-12-10T10:39:31  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3964?focusedCommentId=38908&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-38908
2019-12-10T10:39:46  <the-t-in-rtf> That's a slightly longer term thing, but I could certainly do it as part of the LSR work.
2019-12-10T10:40:04  <stegru> 1. I think you can set the language to "en" (well, you can set it to "dog" if you wanted)
2019-12-10T10:40:06  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. instead of defining enum and enumLabels you'd have each label next to its value
2019-12-10T10:40:21  <the-t-in-rtf> and the QSS?
2019-12-10T10:40:24  <stegru> 2. the QSS will only list what windows has installed.. so "no"
2019-12-10T10:40:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if it can't possibly set it to that or take it as an input, IMO we should leave it out.
2019-12-10T10:41:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if someone somehow managed to get "en" in their list, the QSS wouldn't be able to make sense of it anyway.
2019-12-10T10:43:27  <stegru> so how is "en" getting in there now ..?
2019-12-10T10:43:42  <the-t-in-rtf> it's just set as the default, which would only matter for something like Githens work.
2019-12-10T10:43:52  <the-t-in-rtf> the QSS ignores it
2019-12-10T10:43:57  <stegru> ok ok
2019-12-10T10:43:58  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it's the default in the schema
2019-12-10T10:44:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I could set it to zh-HK if I wanted
2019-12-10T10:45:05  <stegru> ok got it
2019-12-10T10:45:09  <the-t-in-rtf> I left the deprecated ones in just in case, they lump them in with zh-TW these days
2019-12-10T10:47:01  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm
2019-12-10T10:47:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I need to regenerate the list, it should be sorted by description I guess
2019-12-10T10:47:18  <the-t-in-rtf> rather than language code.
2019-12-10T10:47:28  <the-t-in-rtf> other than that I think I'm close
2019-12-10T10:50:53  <stegru> fyi, RFC-5646 describes the language code format
2019-12-10T10:52:53  <stegru> looking at the code for getting the installed languages, it's *possible* to get "en", but that's only if Windows reports "en" as an installed language pack - but it wouldn't because there isn't one
2019-12-10T10:56:01  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, I'll add the RFC to the TODO for properly fixing the "common" setting

2019-12-10T11:11:51  <Bosmon> stegru, the-t-in-rtf - bear in mind that we will also want to accept language encodings reported from other platforms such as MacOS
2019-12-10T11:11:55  <Bosmon> So we can afford to be generous
2019-12-10T11:17:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you have a chance to look into the issue I was having with the defaultGrades for contextAwareness?
2019-12-10T11:17:53  <Bosmon> Justin_o - not yet
2019-12-10T11:18:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, I'll press forward with the other examples in the meantime and cycle back to that one later. The code is checked in and I'll leave that example broken so we remember to fix it
2019-12-10T11:19:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, I'll be able to take a look in a couple of hours
2019-12-10T11:21:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, that's quicker than I was expecting
2019-12-10T11:21:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for chatting with gmoss about the "nomerge" merge policy too.
2019-12-10T11:22:11  <Bosmon> Justin_o - no worries, I'll write that up for the-t-in-rtf shortly
2019-12-10T11:22:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2019-12-10T11:27:38  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I hadn't forgotten that, I'll leave a good TODO.  Once we can move on to the LSR work, I think it's fair to fix it properly then.

2019-12-10T11:40:09  <the-t-in-rtf> We have a similar lurking problem with the contrast themes, I'll leave another TODO there.
2019-12-10T11:43:15  <the-t-in-rtf> speaking of which, we need to discuss how to handle the failing "regular-contrast" theme which basically disables the theme
2019-12-10T11:43:50  <the-t-in-rtf> for now we probably just have to allow it as an option, longer term we need to figure out how enabled/disabled might relate to something like this.
2019-12-10T11:48:42  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I have both fixes ready to test in my dev cloud, hopefully I'll put in the pull today for review.

2019-12-10T16:34:11  <Bosmon> gmoss, Justin_o - I've written up the gpii-binder issue for ADTKINS as https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4259
2019-12-10T16:34:22  <Bosmon> Now looking at Justin_o 's defaultGradeNames issue
2019-12-10T16:38:07  <gmoss> Thanks, Bosmon!
2019-12-10T16:38:10  <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks like your remaining issue is now a simple typo, which I remember seeing the first time round
2019-12-10T16:38:27  <Bosmon> You've got a redundant layer of containment in that grade of "auxiliarySchema":
2019-12-10T16:38:28  <Bosmon>     fluid.defaults("demo.prefsEditor.speakNotSupported", {
2019-12-10T16:38:28  <Bosmon>         auxiliarySchema: {
2019-12-10T16:38:28  <Bosmon>             auxiliarySchema: {
2019-12-10T16:38:28  <Bosmon>                 template: "html/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.html"
2019-12-10T16:38:28  <Bosmon>             }

2019-12-10T16:38:29  <Bosmon>     });
2019-12-10T16:38:45  <Bosmon> Well, that was quick : P
2019-12-10T16:39:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, I'll double check that
2019-12-10T16:40:01  <Justin_o> Teddy, michelled: new repo https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca
2019-12-10T16:40:03  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think checking it once will be sufficient :)
2019-12-10T16:40:53  <Justin_o> Teddy, michelled: I didn't add a .gitignore file because the technology used hasn't been decided yet. I also didn't add license file yet, so you'll need to decide which one you want. Maybe a CC license
2019-12-10T16:41:39  <michelled> Justin_o: what do we usually do with for licensing our websites?
2019-12-10T16:43:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep that was it, thanks :)
2019-12-10T16:43:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also the examples and many of the manual tests are broken in the FLUID-6148 branch because of the includes. I've fixed those in my FLUID-6420 branch though because I figure you'll need to merge my branch into yours anyways
2019-12-10T16:45:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks a lot

2019-12-10T17:09:11  <cindyli> Bosmon, stegru, to use windows settings handler get() API to read settings, "gpii.windows.spiSettingsHandler" such as for reading windows high contrast theme expects a slightly different payload - https://pastebin.com/KJhSzLhv

2019-12-10T17:09:42  <stegru> ok
2019-12-10T17:09:51  <cindyli> in the solution registry, this information right now is defined in "capabilitiesTransformations" block - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6570-L6575
2019-12-10T17:10:35  <cindyli> and the lifecycle manager converter doesn't yet have ability to extract this piece of information
2019-12-10T17:11:47  <cindyli> so, a fix i think about is, when generating this payload, run the "capabilitiesTransformations" block to create this settings.path info

2019-12-10T17:12:42  <stegru> i'm sorry, I'm lost on what the problem is
2019-12-10T17:14:20  <cindyli> stegru: the problem is i need to implement a proper solution to remove this chunk of windows specific code from the universal - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/826/files#diff-2a48866aecf7478e0d32381b8179c327R1343-R1356
2019-12-10T17:15:20  <cindyli> a problem with the fix i mentioned is, for settings with "noMatch" defined in "capabilitiesTransformations" block such as - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L2750-L2752
2019-12-10T17:15:37  <cindyli> they will be output into "setting" block too
2019-12-10T17:18:15  <stegru> what file are you refering to, in the PR? the link doesn't work well for me
2019-12-10T17:19:10  <cindyli> stegru: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4423456fd3293a1bea953326312d1c645a5ba0a5/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L1343-L1357
2019-12-10T17:19:24  <stegru> ah great ok
2019-12-10T17:19:33  <stegru> yes, i see what you mean now
2019-12-10T17:20:49  <cindyli> stegru: with this solution, in your get() implementation, you will receive a payload like - https://pastebin.com/VT4XL9mA
2019-12-10T17:21:11  <cindyli> is that ok?
2019-12-10T17:21:57  <cindyli> it's a bit ridiculous to see "settings.{oneSetting}.value" to be set because that's what your get() API should return
2019-12-10T17:22:53  <cindyli> Bosmon, stegru: other solutions are welcome too
2019-12-10T17:23:33  <cindyli> one solution sgithens suggested is to change the solution registry to add the line of
2019-12-10T17:23:34  <cindyli> "path": "pvParam.dwFlags.HCF_HIGHCONTRASTON"
2019-12-10T17:23:43  <cindyli> directly into the solution registry
2019-12-10T17:24:36  <stegru> yes, "path" is the path within some structure that gets sent to the OS
2019-12-10T17:25:33  <cindyli> ok, you do require that info in the payload passing into get()
2019-12-10T17:26:03  <cindyli> stegru: is it ok if that payload looks like https://pastebin.com/VT4XL9mA?
2019-12-10T17:26:49  <stegru> yes, ti's required
2019-12-10T17:27:35  <stegru> this is where it's used: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/src/SpiSettingsHandler.js#L280-L280
2019-12-10T17:28:43  <cindyli> stegru: but you don't care if there's a value being set because you line 288 will overwrite the value anyway
2019-12-10T17:29:33  <cindyli> ah, you created a new result empty object to start with, which is even better - https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/src/SpiSettingsHandler.js#L277
2019-12-10T17:31:20  <stegru> yes
2019-12-10T17:31:36  <stegru> of course, you're "getting"

2019-12-10T17:35:01  <cindyli> ok, i will try with my solution. windows acceptance tests will tell us if this solution breaks other things. ;)
2019-12-10T17:35:23  <stegru> yes, you can count on that

2019-12-10T18:15:41  <Justin_o> michelled: regarding the license. It doesn't look like we have a license file in many of our site repos. We probably should though. I think we've settled on BSD3 for code and CC by 4.0 for documentation and the like (e.g. wiki) which seems like a good choice for the website too. What do you think?
2019-12-10T18:15:51  <Justin_o> colinclark might have some thoughts too
2019-12-10T18:16:07  <michelled> I like the idea of CC by 4.0
2019-12-10T18:20:44  <Justin_o> michelled: cool, we should probably also make a note of that in the footer of the website or somewhere on the website anyways
2019-12-10T18:21:00  <michelled> right, good point

2019-12-10T19:14:16  <sgithens> cindyli Bosmon stegru I'm in the process of moving that from the capabiities transform up to the actual setting object in supportedSettings. This works right now for the capture tool so I was able to remove the custom SPI hacks from the snapshotter:  https://github.com/sgithens/universal/tree/GPII-3119-part2
2019-12-10T19:15:27  <sgithens> I'm still looking at some reason why the spi acceptance tests don't quite work when I actually remove it from the transform. All the specsToSettings handler type functions during the lifecycle actually seem to just put it there in the settings anyways, so there wasn't any actual change needed to the spi settings handler for it
2019-12-10T19:16:46  <sgithens> it is slightly odd having to make custom presentation handlers to display for the value for them since they are in "value" rather than the top level object
2019-12-10T19:17:00  <sgithens> I believe the `nativeSettingsHandler` requires this formatting as well
2019-12-10T19:20:09  <cindyli> sgithens: what are specsToSettings handler type functions? an example will be helpful
2019-12-10T19:21:45  <sgithens> cindyli: Let me see if I can find them again, they are just some utility functions floating around that adjust the payloads slightly. I think one of them might deal with adding/removing the extra `value` property.
2019-12-10T19:21:59  <sgithens> I had went through it in a lot of depth last week
2019-12-10T19:22:02  <sgithens> with the SPI stuff
2019-12-10T19:22:50  <sgithens> and suddenly in the debugger I realized is was already putting the supportedSettings information in the payload to the settingshandler, so it was pretty easy to just move the path there, which is were it should be anyways
2019-12-10T19:24:00  <sgithens> however, I think the failure I was running in to in the acceptance tests may have just been that the json schema for solutions needed a small update, so I'm going to go back to the first 3119 branch in a sec and see if it works
2019-12-10T19:24:14  <sgithens> if it does it should be a pretty easy merge I think
2019-12-10T19:29:38  <cindyli> sgithens: failing acceptance tests are from the windows repo or the unversal?
2019-12-10T19:30:01  <sgithens> Windows repo, but it may have been because of that issue
2019-12-10T19:30:09  <sgithens> I mean the tests are actually in universal
2019-12-10T19:30:16  <sgithens> just the regular `builtIn` ones
2019-12-10T19:30:20  <cindyli> i see
2019-12-10T19:30:25  <sgithens> which has all SPI ones

2019-12-10T19:31:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm fiddling around with the old multilingual UIO in the ST, and I'd like to get it working in a way that doesn't try to mutate options. Is there a way to update the Table of Contents header in UIO without options distribution or modifying? i.e. is there a model value i can hook into or an invoker i can call
2019-12-10T19:32:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: from my UIO component: "{that fluid.tableOfContents}.options.strings.tocHeader" is no longer viable
2019-12-10T19:32:13  <cindyli> sgithens: ya, saw Sandra's invite
2019-12-10T19:32:37  <gmoss> Justin_o: maybe it's time to reintegrate the localized UIO now... what a big task though
2019-12-10T19:32:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: why can't you use options distributions?
2019-12-10T19:32:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: the value I was previously using is no longer an option, beyond which it will change with the language
2019-12-10T19:33:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm storing tocHeader in the model now
2019-12-10T19:33:21  <sgithens> do you think cockroach is a serious option? Is it based on postgres? I saw that it has a compatible wire protocol, so I was wondering if you can the json fields and same plugins and things as postgres
2019-12-10T19:33:22  <gmoss> on my end that is

2019-12-10T19:33:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: because ToC isn't localized already? let me double check that, because I thought I had fixed that
2019-12-10T19:34:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: you may have, but this code hasn't been updated since our work on FLUID-6300
2019-12-10T19:34:26  <gmoss> and 6303
2019-12-10T19:34:46  <gmoss> besides which I don't recall what state we left things in, I was working on trying to get the l10n enactor to play nice but gave up
2019-12-10T19:36:07  <gmoss> Justin_o: so I guess I have a few potential choices: rip out the l10n until we get it working (least desired), find a way to get it working using what's already in Infusion (middle) and find a way to get it working with minimal code changes (most desired at this point)
2019-12-10T19:36:37  <gmoss> Justin_o: I digress. thanks for checking, looking forward to the answer :)

2019-12-10T19:39:16  <gmoss> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/937 is still open
2019-12-10T19:39:42  <gmoss> and woefully out of date
2019-12-10T19:40:19  <Justin_o> gmoss: With the code base now being based off of the FLUID-6148 work, you'll probably need to migrate it and potentially make a lot of changes because Bosmon changed how the resource loader works
2019-12-10T19:40:39  <cindyli> sgithens: clown is evaluating cockroach. i didn't look deep into it
2019-12-10T19:40:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: it should hopefully address a bunch of those issues of updating the bundles based on changes to the language
2019-12-10T19:41:30  <Justin_o> gmoss: also the table of contents enactor does now have a resource loader https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L434-L471
2019-12-10T19:41:52  <Justin_o> and related message bundles https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/messages/tableOfContents-enactor.json
2019-12-10T19:41:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: to be clear, when you say "migrate it" do you mean "migrate the UIO l10n functionality to infusion" or "use what's in infusion already" or some combination or the two?

2019-12-10T19:43:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: probably the latter. I can't quite remember what's in the UIO l10n but I think you may have had some code to handle user interaction for setting the language.. I'd hope that the internal parts for changing the language would be mostly doable with the updates in Bosmon's branch
2019-12-10T19:44:26  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay. so it looks like the time to ditch UIOMultilingualDemo.js may have finally come

2019-12-10T19:45:02  <Justin_o> gmoss: also the language preference is now in Infusion as well, so you could make use of that, but I think you'll have to use the scheme of tapping into the stored model and I think you didn't want to have a language preference panel
2019-12-10T19:45:20  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's correct, we don't want a language panel at this point

2019-12-10T19:46:15  <Justin_o> gmoss: you could probably still do all that using the language preference and just not having a panel associated with it. Then it would save to the store, but you'd need to wire up your UI to the enhancer and/or store yourself
2019-12-10T19:46:39  <Justin_o> it mostly depends on if you want to save it to the same cookie store or not, I think
2019-12-10T19:48:21  <gmoss> Justin_o: I think where it's stored is of less consequence than the fact that it is being stored at all, so this sounds doable
2019-12-10T19:49:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm feeling apprehensive about wiring up the enactor because of my previous experience, but I'll give it a shot ;)
2019-12-10T19:50:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: you can just use this enactor https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/LocalizationEnactor.js#L29-L58
2019-12-10T19:51:31  <Justin_o> it's resolvable from the root, so you can setup a model relay to it, to be notified of changes.
2019-12-10T19:52:19  <Justin_o> you'll also need to setup something to save values to the store though. I'll have to think about that part
2019-12-10T19:52:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: would I also need to include this panel in the preferences schema, since it's not in the starter set?
2019-12-10T19:53:17  <gmoss> Justin_o: that in particular is what I was most apprehensive about
2019-12-10T19:53:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, you'd need to add an auxiliary schema entry for it.  You can just merge this grade on top https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/LocalizationSchemas.js
2019-12-10T19:53:59  <gmoss> the last time I looked at this, I didn't find an easy way to say "give me UIO plus this one extra panel"
2019-12-10T19:54:01  <Justin_o> but you'll want to remove the panel
2019-12-10T19:54:21  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm working on that part :)
2019-12-10T19:54:23  <Justin_o> right tnow
2019-12-10T19:54:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: indeed :)
2019-12-10T19:54:55  <Justin_o> So if you can wait, I'll hopefully have FLUID-6420 done in the not too distant future
2019-12-10T19:55:10  <gmoss> Justin_o: this is blocking tests now that I've updated to immutable options
2019-12-10T19:55:21  <gmoss> Justin_o: so waiting may not be an option
2019-12-10T19:55:31  <gmoss> depending on how distant or not said future is ;)
2019-12-10T19:56:06  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, in that case you should just switch from using ui options to using the prefs framework directly
2019-12-10T19:56:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: just for this l10n, you mean?
2019-12-10T19:56:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: and then how do I get UIO to update when the locale changes
2019-12-10T19:57:02  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you need to modify UIO in a substantial way, currently it's best to use the prefs framework directly
2019-12-10T19:57:16  <Justin_o> UIO was just a convenience package that had the base set
2019-12-10T19:57:28  <Justin_o> but I'm making all this stuff more flexible now in FLUID-6420
2019-12-10T19:57:53  <gmoss> Justin_o: perhaps it would be easier to do a quick call about this haha.. do you have a couple mins?
2019-12-10T19:58:18  <Justin_o> sure

2019-12-10T21:09:51  <Justin_o> michelled: sure, sounds good
2019-12-10T21:11:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm back now for a bit, how are things going?
2019-12-10T21:12:21  <gmoss> Justin_o: making progress. I've got UIO panels to reload dynamically, but the tab isn't changing dynamically only on page load
2019-12-10T21:12:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: yah, that's not a renderer component
2019-12-10T21:13:07  <gmoss> Justin_o: beyond that I've discovered that the TOC isn't working anyway because the requests to the TOC enactor message bundles are pointing to the wrong folders
2019-12-10T21:13:14  <gmoss> ignoring my override of messagePrefix
2019-12-10T21:13:35  <Justin_o> interesting.. could be a merge issue but not sure
2019-12-10T21:13:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: i'm also unsure. it's what I was digging into when you messaged just now :)
2019-12-10T21:14:10  <gmoss> ResourceLoader-browser.js:71, apparently
2019-12-10T21:14:36  <Justin_o> ah okay.. I'm going to quickly check if there's an easy to refresh the tab and will come back to this other issue
2019-12-10T21:14:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good! i'll continue to focus on the TOC messages :)
2019-12-10T21:16:01  <gmoss> Justin_o: fwiw my code differs substantially from what's in my remote branch
2019-12-10T21:16:12  <gmoss> i.e. all options mutation is gone
2019-12-10T21:16:26  <gmoss> and I've removed large bits of the UIOMultilingualDemo file
2019-12-10T21:17:05  <Justin_o> gmoss: so quite different I guess, but if it's mostly removing things, that's good
2019-12-10T21:17:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, for the tab you can try to call this event again (onCreateSlidingPanelReady) to reinstantiate the sliding panel.

2019-12-10T21:18:06  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, giving it a shot
2019-12-10T21:26:08  <gmoss> Justin_o: it reloads the tab, but now the sliding panel isn't working properly. UIO won't open if it isn't already open, and if it is open the panels will rerender out of flow and the tab disappears
2019-12-10T21:26:25  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-omledjdymgsqvvjb> has joined #fluid-work
2019-12-10T21:26:35  <Justin_o> gmoss: hmm.. that doesn't sound good
2019-12-10T21:27:59  <gmoss> Justin_o: maybe this is a timing issue.. also I've noticed that the tool's performance has taken a huge hit with the latest round of updates, especially with the inspector open. changing languages with the inspector closed is 1s+, with it open it's like several seconds to reload all the messages. also it doesn't seem to have cached the messages and attempts to reload them every time
2019-12-10T21:28:11  <gmoss> it could be related
2019-12-10T21:28:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: could be.. that's worth mentioning to Bosmon too
2019-12-10T21:28:56  <gmoss> Bosmon: please see above :P
2019-12-10T21:29:33  <gmoss> Bosmon: I noticed yesterday and continue to notice today that the tool is very slow to load, especially with chrome's inspector open. i haven't tested to see if this issue exists across browsers
2019-12-10T21:30:28  <gmoss> Bosmon Justin_o: can confirm things are lightning-fast in Firefox. maybe a chrome issue
2019-12-10T21:31:34  <gmoss> Justin_o: if you'd like to pair, I'm available :) i can show you what's going on with the panel
2019-12-10T21:32:34  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2019-12-10T21:32:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: same zoom room as last time

2019-12-10T21:45:40  <Bosmon> gmoss - thanks
2019-12-10T21:45:51  <Bosmon> We should try profiling it to see where most of the hit is
2019-12-10T21:46:06  <Bosmon> We did have a similar issue back in the old days
2019-12-10T21:46:29  <Bosmon> One interesting cause was that we uncovered a set of event thrashing that was causing the whole set of panels to reload themselves about 8 times for every one refresh
2019-12-10T21:47:15  <Bosmon> Another useful savings might be trying to keep the message bundles in the "resources" area and not pass them through the model apparatus, although this could be seen as a bit anti-religious
