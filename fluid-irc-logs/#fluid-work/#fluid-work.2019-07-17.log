2019-07-17T14:55:49  <kendraf> sepidehshahi: if you search Karma in the drive photos from camp karma come up because they have been re-named with Karma in the title
2019-07-17T14:55:52  <Justin_o> cindyli: are you able to run the infusion tests through the vagrant VM. They keep stalling at the syllabification tests in Chrome for me
2019-07-17T14:56:00  <Justin_o> I'm just running them from master
2019-07-17T14:56:29  <sepidehshahi> kendraf I just found them. Leanne has moved them to a folder called Week 1- July 8-12
2019-07-17T14:56:41  <Justin_o> cindyli: this was happening to me earlier in the week when I was updating a PR, but the CI was able to run all the tests. I was also able to run them directly in Chrome on the VM too.
2019-07-17T14:57:00  <crystalchan> It seems to be in the folder 'Week 1 - July 8-12' sepidehshahi

2019-07-17T14:58:18  <Justin_o> cindyli: master
2019-07-17T14:58:20  <cindyli> ok
2019-07-17T14:58:38  <Justin_o> I merged from upstream before running the tests too
2019-07-17T15:02:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think I've seen stalls like that, although never locally
2019-07-17T15:02:37  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, you'll make me a favor if you don't show up :P
2019-07-17T15:02:51  <Bosmon> jhernandez - OK, I'll let Sandra know we should can it

2019-07-17T15:04:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon: after forcing it through by clicking on "rerun" test in the VM, it runs through the rest of the tests but I get an error from NPM. "Failed at the infusion@3.0.0 test:browser script"
2019-07-17T15:04:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: does that seem familiar too?

2019-07-17T15:06:39  <Justin_o> okay
2019-07-17T15:06:40  <Bosmon> There have been a lot of odd burps and explosions in CI recently
2019-07-17T15:07:10  <Bosmon> One of them was apparently explainable as a localised github to AWS routing outage or something like that
2019-07-17T15:08:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. do you remember when that was.. I mean was it around 5 days ago?
2019-07-17T15:08:12  <Bosmon> Justin_o - but, for example, here are a couple of aborted runs of mine which I think were indeed in the Syllabification Enactor
2019-07-17T15:08:14  <Bosmon> https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-tests/9/console

2019-07-17T15:10:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it doesn't look like the changes you made between the test runs for PR 824 should have caused the tests to start passing again
2019-07-17T15:11:02  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's right, the failures are simply random
2019-07-17T15:11:16  <Justin_o> ;(
2019-07-17T15:11:19  <Bosmon> Especially given how very different my branch is to master, this suggests something fairly intimately tied to the tests themselves
2019-07-17T15:12:15  <Justin_o> thankfully that narrows things down a bit. I guess I'll try to see if I can reproduce from running the all-tests directly
2019-07-17T15:12:42  <Bosmon> If I were to make a random guess, I would say that the failure is that it is possible sometimes for the promise dispensed from fluid.prefs.enactor.syllabification.injectScript to never resolve
2019-07-17T15:12:46  <Justin_o> I wonder if it's related to some chrome update too, I don't remember having this issue prior to my leave, but maybe I'm forgetting something or just happened to not catch it then

2019-07-17T15:13:20  <Justin_o> hmm.. that seems plausible
2019-07-17T15:14:04  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can't see an enormously clear cause for that, but then $.ajax is notoriously dicy... you could test this hypothesis by attaching, say, a 5 second timer to it that automatically rejects so that at least we'd see a specific cause of failure in the logs
2019-07-17T15:14:26  <Bosmon> Note that in my upcoming branch I have axed all uses of $.ajax from the core framework and you might want to consider the same : P
2019-07-17T15:14:38  <Justin_o> what did you do instead
2019-07-17T15:14:59  <Bosmon> I've replaced it all with raw XHR which I think is by now stable and standardised enough
2019-07-17T15:15:13  <Bosmon> It also means that we don't have to jump through all these ridiculous hoops whenever we want binary XHR
2019-07-17T15:16:23  <Justin_o> well the tests passed on my second run through :( I'll try to get them to fail again and test out your theory
2019-07-17T15:16:32  <cindyli> Justin_o: running "npm run test:vagrantBrowser" has all tests passed on my machine. running the 2nd time to see if it's a random failure
2019-07-17T15:16:41  <Bosmon> It's certainly random
2019-07-17T15:17:03  <Justin_o> cindyli: also you may want to try on a clean vm. i.e. vagrant destroy before running the tests
2019-07-17T15:18:51  <cindyli> Justin_o: as i haven't run the infusion vm quite a while, "vagrant up" did rebuild the vm. but i will do a fresh destroy -> up next time to ensure
2019-07-17T15:19:03  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay thanks
2019-07-17T15:19:32  <cindyli> one failure with firefox in vm:

2019-07-17T15:21:01  <Justin_o> oh actually that may be an old one.. do the tests still run and all show up as passing. I remember we had random errors popping up but they didn't affect the test runs

2019-07-17T21:20:22  <gmoss> Bosmon: I saw your comment on SJRK-255, and I'm putting together a somewhat-detailed reply for you, but the short answer is I'm not 100% sure whether it's UIO (since iirc it doesn't have an event to indicate the msgResolver has finished its work) or my use of it (since my use of onUioReady is too early)
2019-07-17T21:20:31  <gmoss> likely some combination thereof
2019-07-17T21:21:03  <gmoss> I'll be signing off for the day in 10 minutes or so, but I intend to reply in detail tomorrow as well as file the requestHandlers issue we spoke about
