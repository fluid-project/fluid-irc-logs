2020-10-07T12:14:07  <Bosmon> Hey Justin_o - thanks for making all those linting fixes
2020-10-07T12:14:10  <Bosmon> I was dreading that task : P
2020-10-07T12:14:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) np happy to do so, especially because I updated the related linting infrastructure.
2020-10-07T12:32:21  <Justin_o> greatislander, gmoss: in the presentation about automated visual validation testing, I believe they mentioned applitools which uses ai/ml to spot relevant differences. It looks like they offer a free license for open source projects. https://applitools.com/open-source/ might be worth looking into.
2020-10-07T12:32:40  <Justin_o> it looks like it works with a bunch of existing testing tools, including cypress, but I don't see any integration with backstop
2020-10-07T12:36:41  <greatislander> Justin_o yeah, I'm just looking into it now! looks like it's an alternative to Backstop rather than a supplenent

2020-10-07T12:37:53  <Justin_o> I don't know enough about these tools yet.. would be interested to know what you think about it.
2020-10-07T12:45:37  <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you know if there is something that replaced this https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments
2020-10-07T12:47:32  <gtirloni> AFAIK, no
2020-10-07T13:00:57  <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you or someone else maintain the images we use for vagrant. for example for running infusions tests in a vagrant vm?
2020-10-07T13:01:59  <gtirloni> yep, I maintain the fedora bo

2020-10-07T13:03:11  <Justin_o> gtirloni: great thanks.. not sure if they need it or not, but do you know if they are using node 10 or later?
2020-10-07T13:05:54  <gtirloni> Justin_o: they are using 10. I'm just waiting for the 15.x repo to be created so I can update the ansible role.. later this week
2020-10-07T13:06:20  <gtirloni> I've got the PR ready to submit
2020-10-07T13:06:53  <Justin_o> gtirloni: excellent, thanks for being on top of all these things
2020-10-07T13:07:04  <gtirloni> np :)

2020-10-07T14:20:04  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: after some initial interest, it doesn't seem like eslint will incorporate my changes to outputting a summary on successful linting. https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13725
2020-10-07T14:21:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  the general suggestion is to just use a custom formatter, as we have already done. Another option is to use the multiple ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-formatter-multiple ) and summary ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-summary ) formatters.
2020-10-07T14:21:40  <the-t-in-rtf> good to know.
2020-10-07T14:21:47  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks for working on that.
2020-10-07T14:22:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess there's a bunch of refactoring coming.
2020-10-07T14:23:35  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: no problem.. I think we should probably just stick with the custom formatter I have there already, and update it as needed in the future.
2020-10-07T14:26:07  <Bosmon> The summary is incredibly helpful - only yesterday I spotted that several of my files weren't being caught by the glob properly

2020-10-07T14:26:42  <Bosmon> Well, actually what I caught is that fluid-grunt-lint-all will silently do nothing if you don't have a .eslintrc.json file
2020-10-07T14:27:22  <Bosmon> Probably not what we desire in practice - but at least the fact that we expect a summary output alerted me that something wasn't right
2020-10-07T14:37:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so of historical interest for us oldsters - I just added a test into my branch verifying what one might call "CollectionSpace-style rendering" for templateRenderingView : P

2020-10-07T14:37:45  <Bosmon> This only took about 11 years since Anastasia implemented her "funny thing"...
2020-10-07T14:37:55  <Bosmon> And then I implemented an even funnier thing in response
2020-10-07T14:54:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for sharing :)
2020-10-07T14:54:46  <Justin_o> are there other injectionTypes?
2020-10-07T14:55:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also will the new renderer be able to just re-render portions that are tied to a specific model value that has changed, in stead of re-rendering the entire DOM structure
2020-10-07T14:55:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that is its main purpose : P
2020-10-07T14:56:06  <Bosmon> Justin_o - there are all the injection types that you allowed for : P
2020-10-07T14:56:17  <Bosmon> The original skeleton of this component was written by you ....
2020-10-07T14:56:24  <Justin_o> really?
2020-10-07T14:56:48  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/NewViewSupport.js#L64
2020-10-07T14:56:49  <Bosmon> Yes
2020-10-07T14:57:27  <Bosmon> Just check out git blame : P
2020-10-07T14:58:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh this grade.. yes forgot about that
2020-10-07T15:10:35  <Bosmon> This isn't the "renderer proper" but we may as well assure that if people continue to produce markup by blinding banging on the document with jQuery like a psychopath, that it works as expected : P
2020-10-07T15:11:03  <Bosmon> It does use the same "workflow" scheme to ensure that all I/O is done and all models are computed before generating markup, as the real renderer does
2020-10-07T15:11:24  <Bosmon> You will notice that these components are blissfully free of "afterRender" and "afterResourcesFetched" event junk of all kinds
2020-10-07T15:12:05  <Bosmon> You simply say MAKE IT SO
2020-10-07T15:23:46  <gmoss> Justin_o: thanks for finding the Open Source info page on applitools' website! I tried finding it yesterday during the talk, and asked during Q&A, but I didn't dig too hard as it was distracting me from the talk, and they didn't answer the question. Now we know :) I'd also tried asking about GHA integration, and she was just like "yeah it'll work with all of your CI software".
2020-10-07T15:23:46  <gmoss> But yeah it seems to be intended as an alternative to (or even an improvement over) BackstopJS. I think it's worth exploring for sure.
2020-10-07T15:23:55  <gmoss> greatislander ^^
2020-10-07T15:25:12  <greatislander> yeah, it looks very interesting! I intend to check it out sometime in the next week or so
2020-10-07T15:28:21  <Justin_o> gmoss: it would be interesting to see how well it works and what the integration with Github Actions is like.
2020-10-07T15:28:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: definitely :) glad they have an open source licence so we can find out :)
2020-10-07T15:51:18  <alanharnum> I will say if anyone wants a Hacktoberfest shirt and wants to learn a bit of Haskell / functional programming, this repo has been specifically set up for that (I haven't worked through it yet but it seems pretty cool): https://github.com/kowainik/learn4haskell
2020-10-07T15:54:37  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks for sharing
2020-10-07T15:55:06  <Justin_o> gmoss: you'll need to add the appropriate label to the PR if you want it to qualify for Hacktoberfest. I don't think we'll be adding the topic to our repos to avoid spam.
2020-10-07T15:55:31  <gmoss> Justin_o: ah, I wasn't sure I was able to label
2020-10-07T15:55:48  <gmoss> I don't see an option to do so in the edit fields on the PR
2020-10-07T15:56:06  <gmoss> I can only change the title and target branch
2020-10-07T16:00:23  <Justin_o> gmoss: I added a label, could you please verify if it is correct
2020-10-07T16:01:32  <gmoss> Justin_o: it is correct, thanks!
2020-10-07T16:03:05  <gmoss> the current rules are outlined on this page (the section in pink) https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update

2020-10-07T17:44:28  <Justin_o> I can merge if you are happy with them
2020-10-07T17:59:36  <gtirloni> Justin_o: looks okay to me
