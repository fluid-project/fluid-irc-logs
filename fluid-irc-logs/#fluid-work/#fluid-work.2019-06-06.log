2019-06-06T16:37:52  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @cindyli.  Just pulling up my IDE and looking at the tests for the validation.
2019-06-06T16:37:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll send a link in a minute
2019-06-06T16:38:14  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2019-06-06T16:41:00  <the-t-in-rtf> So, it's the preferences get handler, post handler, and put handler that now validate.
2019-06-06T16:41:37  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: what about /settings GET, PUT endpoints?

2019-06-06T16:43:04  <the-t-in-rtf> the GET is secured

2019-06-06T16:43:31  <the-t-in-rtf> so yes
2019-06-06T16:43:35  <the-t-in-rtf> that should work
2019-06-06T16:43:45  <the-t-in-rtf> just send {}, or false, or null
2019-06-06T16:43:47  <the-t-in-rtf> that should be enough
2019-06-06T16:44:25  <the-t-in-rtf> or "cindy rules"
2019-06-06T16:44:30  <the-t-in-rtf> anything other than a valid payload
2019-06-06T16:46:43  <the-t-in-rtf> Is that enough, or do you need more?
2019-06-06T16:46:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I can stick around for another 15 or so depending.
2019-06-06T16:50:28  <cindyli> trying..
