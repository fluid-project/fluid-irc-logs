2019-12-30T22:39:22  <sgithens> Bosmon: It seems I have may have gotten the pouchdb session store working by just adding a `path` option to it's configuration. It seems as if if was creating a separate cookie for each path request... like one for `/` one for `/ppt/home` and for static directories... `/static/stuff.html`. Which is a little wierd. need to test more, but at least I can log in and stuff
2019-12-30T22:39:51  <sgithens> none of the other session stores I used required that option
2019-12-30T22:40:27  <sgithens> I guess I'll try and put it up to my cluster now....
