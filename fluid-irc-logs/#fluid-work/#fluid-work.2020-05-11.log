2020-05-11T13:22:13  <christop_> stegru -- In Morphic Classic, how are we dealing with the differences in defaults for various Windows AT settings across various versions of Windows?  [For instance: FollowCaret and FollowFocus are both FALSE (0) in build 1809, but they are TRUE (1) in builds 1903 and 1909.]
2020-05-11T13:23:28  <christop_> Of note: at install time, there are no ScreenMagnifier settings written out to the registry, so we have to assume defaults.  I guess what I'm looking for is: where are we storing the differences in defaults (for when no registry entries are available) for different builds of Windows 10?  Or is that something which hasn't been built out yet?

2020-05-11T13:24:48  <christop_> I understand if we built our defaults around one specific version of Windows 10.  I'm working on the Morphic Lite side of things to analyze core and edge cases for owen, so any/all insights you have from the Morphic Classic side are greatly appreciated :)

2020-05-11T14:58:59  <Bosmon> christop_ - yes, indeed our current defaults are built around one version of Windows 10, but I believe that OS version-specific defaults are a facility that is upcoming in the-t-in-rtf 's reorganisation of the solutions registry
2020-05-11T14:59:16  <Bosmon> So yes, this is definitely currently a rather raw edge case : P
2020-05-11T14:59:42  <christop_> :D
2020-05-11T15:00:30  <christop_> Okay cool.  I just sent you and Bosmon and Kasper some notes, for when the-t-in-rtf's Solutions Registry reorganization is ready :). I'll forward that e-mail to the-t-in-rtf now too.
