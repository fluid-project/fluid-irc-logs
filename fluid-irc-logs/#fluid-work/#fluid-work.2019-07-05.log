2019-07-05T11:37:08  <Bosmon> jhernandez - The revert seemed to look good, but perhaps we made a mistake
2019-07-05T11:37:13  <Bosmon> Do you have an active branch?

2019-07-05T11:42:22  <jhernandez> that will pull everything
2019-07-05T11:42:55  <jhernandez> but I was in the middle of going back in universal to see what exactly originated this

2019-07-05T14:03:43  <crystalchan> thanks michelled!
2019-07-05T14:04:03  <michelled> I'm going to work at home today so ping me here or by email if you need anything :)
2019-07-05T14:09:00  <crystalchan> Sounds good! We'll be working with Sepideh and Simon today :)
2019-07-05T14:09:17  <michelled> great!
2019-07-05T14:15:31  *** crystalchan <crystalchan!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-hmwxtflbmgezqrxb> has left #fluid-work
2019-07-05T14:16:02  <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes, I can reproduce the problem
2019-07-05T14:16:14  <Bosmon> Bizarre that it is still here even after withdrawing cindyli's defaultSettings pull
2019-07-05T14:16:21  <Bosmon> I'll debug in to try to discover what the circle is this time
2019-07-05T14:23:45  <Bosmon> cindyli, jhernandez - there is still lots of bad stuff in trunk: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L287
2019-07-05T14:24:13  <Bosmon> We've got a seemingly asynchronous thing that then assigns back into the component's options
2019-07-05T14:25:28  <cindyli> Bosmon: only options can be distributed down to subcomponents
2019-07-05T14:25:39  <Bosmon> cindyli - but options can never be assigned to
2019-07-05T14:25:46  <Bosmon> As usual, it seems that I reviewed this pull myself : P
2019-07-05T14:25:47  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/708
2019-07-05T14:26:04  <Bosmon> And merged it myself
2019-07-05T14:26:08  <Bosmon> I should be killed : P
2019-07-05T14:26:25  <cindyli> nah, you did the right thing ;)
2019-07-05T14:27:46  <cindyli> Bosmon: how can a calculated value be distributed if it cannot be assigned to an option?
2019-07-05T14:28:16  <cindyli> and this has been there for quite a while and hasn't caused problems
2019-07-05T14:28:47  <Bosmon> So, here is our current circle: server tries to construct flatMatchMaker -> it needs {flowManager}.ontologyHandler -> starts to construct flowManager -> its onCreate fires, loading the defaultSettings -> invokes the privateMatchMaker to construct them -> matchMakerDispatcher fires, demanding {ontologyHandler}, which has not loaded yet
2019-07-05T14:29:01  <Bosmon> It's actually totally unaffected by the pull request we reverted
2019-07-05T14:29:40  <cindyli> we can fix it by creating ontologyHandler as the first thing
2019-07-05T14:29:52  <cindyli> if the main thing it does is to load the transformSpec
2019-07-05T14:29:57  <cindyli> from the file system
2019-07-05T14:30:17  <Bosmon> cindyli - well the framework doesn't encourage you to do things "first", it just goes around the chain of references in a data-driven way : P
2019-07-05T14:31:06  <Bosmon> But perhaps one way out is to move out the ontologyHandler to top level
2019-07-05T14:32:04  <Bosmon> It doesn't appear to depend on anything else
2019-07-05T14:32:23  <Bosmon> Then we can just refer to it as {ontologyHandler} rather than {flowManager}.ontologyHandler
2019-07-05T14:34:18  <cindyli> nice solution

2019-07-05T15:24:51  <jhernandez> hmm, interesting
2019-07-05T15:25:44  <jhernandez> so, it's been there for long time but now we're hitting it for the first time
2019-07-05T15:25:46  <jhernandez> weird
2019-07-05T15:27:03  <jhernandez> so, we'd need to provide a config for the ontologyHandler and then merge that config in where required?
2019-07-05T15:27:46  <cindyli> jhernandez: no, ontologyHandler is always required, we just need to move it to the top level of the component tree
2019-07-05T15:28:08  <jhernandez> oh, I see
2019-07-05T15:28:10  <cindyli> Bosmon: all review comments for GPII-3988 have been addressed. it's ready for another look: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/795
2019-07-05T15:28:25  <cindyli> are you working on GPII-4005? if not, i will start on it
2019-07-05T15:29:28  <jhernandez> nope, i was trying to figure out how this can become a top level component
2019-07-05T15:30:00  <cindyli> ah, i see, if it has to been at the same level of flowManager. good question
2019-07-05T15:30:08  <jhernandez> top level .. of the app, right?
2019-07-05T15:30:10  <jhernandez> yeah
2019-07-05T15:30:53  <jhernandez> I mean, I somehow remember myself doing such thing when working on the deviceReporter
2019-07-05T15:31:37  <jhernandez> sorry, didn't want to bring in more confusion :P
2019-07-05T15:33:05  <cindyli> nah, it actually un-confuses me. ya, an extra config file seems the way for it, unless Bosmon has a better solution
2019-07-05T15:33:21  * jhernandez gives it a quick try

2019-07-05T15:37:52  <jhernandez> at least, I'm not getting the error and the defaultSettings.json file gets copied into the roaming folder

2019-07-05T16:03:35  <jhernandez> oh, okay, running the universal tests locally now requires couchdb
2019-07-05T16:03:40  <jhernandez> pulling the vagrant box
2019-07-05T16:20:04  <jhernandez> cindyli: question
2019-07-05T16:20:13  <jhernandez> doesn't the vm bring couchdb in?
2019-07-05T16:22:30  <cindyli> universal vm?
2019-07-05T16:22:39  <cindyli> it does bring couchdb in
2019-07-05T16:23:31  <cindyli> universal vm uses fedora which supports docker
2019-07-05T16:23:49  <jhernandez> and .... how should I run the node tests?
2019-07-05T16:23:57  <jhernandez> do I need to supply any env variable or the like?
2019-07-05T16:24:45  <cindyli> on you host machine, in the universal root dir, run "npm run test:vagrantNode"

2019-07-05T16:30:07  <jhernandez> I guess I'd need to also merge the ontologyHandler config into a few more config files
2019-07-05T16:41:04  <Bosmon> jhernandez - can't we just stick it into gpii.flowManager.config.base.json5 ?
2019-07-05T16:41:11  <Bosmon> Sounds like it would involve touching less stuff
2019-07-05T16:42:42  <Bosmon> jhernandez - just stick it in at line 28 after the flowManager
2019-07-05T16:50:11  <jhernandez> hmm, yeah, but I wasn't sure it was the right place
2019-07-05T16:50:44  <jhernandez> okay, let me finish the last test pass I'm doing
2019-07-05T16:50:57  <jhernandez> and will try that
2019-07-05T16:51:39  <jhernandez> because it's true that I'm finally merging the new config into a few different places

2019-07-05T20:06:04  <sgithens> Bosmon: Is kettle.config.loadConfig the only thing we ever use to load all of these json5 configurations into the system? In all our config, shared, tests/configs dirs, etc?  I'm wondering if there is a similar to mechanism to load all these config files in so their defaults are registered, but not actually start any of them up, so that they could be  included statically or dynamically as subcomponents on other things. Or
2019-07-05T20:06:04  <sgithens> just so they could be inspected in dev tools.
2019-07-05T20:06:33  <sgithens> it looks like `loadConfig` always creates the top level thing as part of the loading
2019-07-05T20:06:44  <sgithens> I just want to load all the defaults in to the system
2019-07-05T20:08:19  <sgithens> partially because I also want to carefully create sets of these components as direct members on testCaseHolders, and not as separate kettle applications

2019-07-05T20:09:40  <sgithens> :p
2019-07-05T20:10:45  <sgithens> I guess they can be passed straight to `defaults`? I'm not sure if all of this is part of the straight infusion syntax, or if some of it was added as pieces of kettle
2019-07-05T20:11:02  <sgithens> like these `mergeConfigs` sections, are they part of vanilla infusion defaults syntax?
2019-07-05T20:12:11  <sgithens> it didn't show up in a infusion-docs search, so I was assuming this extra processing kettle does
2019-07-05T20:12:24  <sgithens> just sort of looking into the code for them now
2019-07-05T20:16:16  <sgithens> ok, it looks like you just need to use `kettle.config.createDefaults` instead of `loadConfig`
