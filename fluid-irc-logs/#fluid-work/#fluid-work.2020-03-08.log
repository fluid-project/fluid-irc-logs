2020-03-08T06:03:35  <batey96> thanks aashimgarg[m].It looks like the idea list page has been updated recently because on it,the mentors have given an option "Migrate the FLOE Project and Fluid Project websites to use a modern static site generator (like Hugo, Jekyll, etc.)"
2020-03-08T06:05:56  <batey96> and for the infusion documentation and refactoring, mentors stated "Update the Infusion Documentation to be generated using Hugo or another actively-maintained site/documentation generator instead of DocPad". My doubt was if among all the SSGs,the mentors have prioritize a particular SSG..Thanks
