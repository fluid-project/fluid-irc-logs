2019-10-08T11:28:58  <the-t-in-rtf1> @sgithens and @cindyli, just chatting with @bosmon, he'll be with us in a few
2019-10-08T11:29:04  <the-t-in-rtf1> I'll fire up Skype whenever you're both around

2019-10-08T11:30:10  <cindyli> sure. i'm around anyway
2019-10-08T11:32:17  <sgithens> good morning!
2019-10-08T11:39:10  <the-t-in-rtf1> I'm getting constant connection errors trying to edit the "New Database Requirements" doc, but you can at least see my new notes while we wait.

2019-10-08T11:41:27  <the-t-in-rtf1> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
2019-10-08T11:41:31  <sgithens> is there a pirate pad for raw technical notes, or are we putting everything in there?
2019-10-08T11:41:32  <sgithens> hahhahaa
2019-10-08T11:41:35  *** the-t-in-rtf1 is now known as the-t-in-rtf-1
2019-10-08T11:42:06  <sgithens> I did a bit of exploration by shoving all our couch records in to postgreSQL and then seeing what the queries would be.  https://github.com/GPII/universal/compare/master...sgithens:postgre-prototype
2019-10-08T11:42:34  <sgithens> It needs another hour or two to finish out the queries
2019-10-08T11:42:41  <the-t-in-rtf-1> ah, cool, so you were using the JSONB stuff
2019-10-08T11:43:03  <sgithens> you have to if you want to index properties
2019-10-08T11:43:06  <the-t-in-rtf-1> I only read about it, hadn't tried it lately
2019-10-08T11:43:18  <the-t-in-rtf-1> I know you were using it because of that -> syntax
2019-10-08T11:43:24  <the-t-in-rtf-1> s/lately/at all/
2019-10-08T11:44:20  <sgithens> the queries are in progress still.  BUt I did put the 300-ish docs from my local test Couch into postgre with the script
2019-10-08T11:46:28  <the-t-in-rtf-1> how did you handle the JOINs?
2019-10-08T11:46:44  <the-t-in-rtf-1> nm,
2019-10-08T11:46:46  <the-t-in-rtf-1> I see it
2019-10-08T11:47:10  <sgithens> I'm still working through them, I don't expect them all to work yet
2019-10-08T11:47:13  <the-t-in-rtf-1> I guess I was assuming we'd segment types as separate tables, but I see what you did for now.
2019-10-08T11:47:29  <sgithens> that will be the second approach below
2019-10-08T11:47:45  <the-t-in-rtf-1> I think stuffing the main payload in docs as JSONB is perfectly fine
2019-10-08T11:48:02  <the-t-in-rtf-1> I was going to argue for doing that for settings and prefs rather than making those a massive table of individual settings/prefs
2019-10-08T11:48:11  <sgithens> I stubbed out separate tables but haven't filled them in
2019-10-08T11:48:18  <the-t-in-rtf-1> Yeah, I see that.
2019-10-08T11:48:19  <sgithens> oh yeah
2019-10-08T11:48:25  <sgithens> that should def be json I think
2019-10-08T11:49:13  <sgithens> honestly, depending on the performance of jsonb indexes, it could all actually probably stay has payloads.  I feel like if we make separate tables it might be more for out personal mental cognition :)

2019-10-08T14:20:46  <cindyli> Bosmon: while working on the complexity of https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3958 to add the "pullModel" API, I feel https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3828 should be easier to tackle because it shouldn't need to go thru the reading process GPII-3958 provides in order just to receive the setting schema. after looking around in the code base, I noticed a schema file generated at "%gpii-universal/build/schemas/settings-schema.json".
2019-10-08T14:20:47  <cindyli>  It includes all schemas for common terms and application terms. "%gpii-universal/testData/ontologies/flat.json5" appears as a subset of this file. Looking into the code base, this file currently is only used by the-t-in-rtf's request validation. I'm thinking to use this file to fix one issue that the old GPII-3828 pull request has.

2019-10-08T14:26:18  <the-t-in-rtf> If you have a new enough universal, there is a combined file in the build directory.
2019-10-08T14:26:41  <the-t-in-rtf> %gpii-universal/build/schemas/solution-schema-codex.json
2019-10-08T14:27:33  <the-t-in-rtf> That's what later validation work uses instead of the other files.

2019-10-08T14:28:35  <the-t-in-rtf> In fact that's also what's used in master:
2019-10-08T14:28:35  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/66d03869533c5308dba87511ba9e61093e0f9a7a/gpii/node_modules/solutionsRegistry/src/js/sr-validation-middleware.js#L112
2019-10-08T14:29:13  <the-t-in-rtf> If you're still trying to look at both "common" and "application" stuff, that's what I'd use, @cindyli.
2019-10-08T14:29:30  <the-t-in-rtf> The other file you mention is also old.
2019-10-08T14:29:43  <the-t-in-rtf> (in the build dir)
2019-10-08T14:31:30  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: is the commit# in one of your branches? I don't see it in the master
2019-10-08T14:32:07  <the-t-in-rtf> just a minute
2019-10-08T14:33:02  <the-t-in-rtf> my IDE tricked me, just a sec
2019-10-08T14:36:14  <the-t-in-rtf> Or rather, it didn't.
2019-10-08T14:36:15  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/794
2019-10-08T14:36:26  <the-t-in-rtf> It was merged, but I think it's parked off to the side somewhere until it's safe to deploy.
2019-10-08T14:36:56  <the-t-in-rtf> Hopefully @Bosmon can comment on where that is at the moment.
2019-10-08T14:37:40  <cindyli> ok. thanks. is the content of "solution-schema-codex.json" same as the old "settings-schema.json", or they are different?
2019-10-08T14:38:29  <the-t-in-rtf> As they are generated, I can't just look, but I think they are different.
2019-10-08T14:38:41  <the-t-in-rtf> As you have pointed out to me, once it's a settings schema there are no "common" terms.
2019-10-08T14:38:55  <cindyli> ok. i see. that makes sense too
2019-10-08T14:39:34  <cindyli> i will try with your branch to generate one to understand what to expect
2019-10-08T14:39:37  <cindyli> thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2019-10-08T14:40:29  <the-t-in-rtf> You're welcome, if we don't talk about it before, bring it up in tomorrow's meeting so we can coordinate.
2019-10-08T14:41:02  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that sounds like a reasonable simplification
2019-10-08T14:41:31  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - as for https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/794 , I understand that this was parked at our general request until we were able to merge stuff
2019-10-08T14:41:55  <Bosmon> In fact this is what I have really been asking about all these meetings, but I guess the question has been misunderstood as to be about something more ambitious
2019-10-08T14:42:07  <Bosmon> When I ask, "When can we start pushing stuff to staging", I was really asking about pull 794
2019-10-08T14:42:46  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, the good news is I have new smoke tests, but we need to briefly discuss tomorrow.
2019-10-08T14:43:04  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i think you need to have a deployment plan and also show your deployment result in your dev cluster to convince the ops that this pull is safe to be merged and deployed
2019-10-08T14:43:05  <the-t-in-rtf> once that's in we should be able to fairly evaluate further efforts
2019-10-08T14:43:26  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, @cindyli, but we can't do that until my pull to update the smoke tests is merged.
2019-10-08T14:43:40  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. my changes would sneak right past as they aren't tested by the old smoke tests.
2019-10-08T14:44:05  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I hope we can easily move forward after tomorrow's meeting.
2019-10-08T14:44:05  <cindyli> i see. good to bring it up tomorrow if your pull to update the smoke tests is waiting for reviews from ops
2019-10-08T14:44:17  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I just wanted to talk about one point, i.e. the "write" tests.
2019-10-08T14:44:35  <the-t-in-rtf> we'll definitely go through it tomorrow.

2019-10-08T15:09:16  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that
2019-10-08T15:09:24  <Bosmon> That thing which must absolutely never happen : P
2019-10-08T15:09:28  <Justin_o> it's not even a member
2019-10-08T15:09:32  <Bosmon> Right
2019-10-08T15:09:43  <Bosmon> It's a 100% monstrosity : P
2019-10-08T15:10:46  <Justin_o> haha
2019-10-08T15:11:07  <Justin_o> I wonder if parentBundles are regularly accessed like this but with the component passed along
2019-10-08T15:11:16  <Justin_o> or if this was just trying to package things up for the test
2019-10-08T15:11:50  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, who knows
2019-10-08T15:12:04  <Bosmon> But I guess my mission right now is to make the failure mode of this at least bearable
2019-10-08T15:12:11  <Bosmon> Before we ban the practice outright : P
2019-10-08T15:12:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: how did you find it?
2019-10-08T15:13:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I'm trying to resolve https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6406
2019-10-08T15:13:58  <Bosmon> And whilst I now resolve the original issue, this site popped out of the woodwork as a fresh source of failure in the "new new new new world"
2019-10-08T15:14:26  <Bosmon> The result currently is that the "new workflow for old renderer components" ends up observing a lot of unevaluated options
2019-10-08T15:14:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we should probably fix this too https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L125
2019-10-08T15:15:00  <Bosmon> And the reason turns out to be that the process of observing its own options ends up kicking off the construction of this fresh component which then confuses its workflow
2019-10-08T15:15:30  <Bosmon> But whilst we want to ban the practice of instantiating components during options evaluation, it would be better for the workflow system to be bulletproof first
2019-10-08T15:16:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes sense.. couldn't we check that the component creation was inside of a components  /dynamicComponents block
2019-10-08T15:16:19  <Justin_o> and through an error otherwise
2019-10-08T15:16:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, we will probably do that
2019-10-08T15:17:09  <Bosmon> Although I'd like to get this upgrade through with as few further required changes to people's designs as possible
2019-10-08T15:18:38  <Bosmon> Even if this is a horrifying practice which causes a guaranteed memory leak, I'd like to get it working again if possible : P
2019-10-08T15:18:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'd hope no one else is doing that
2019-10-08T15:19:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, we have no very easy way of knowing until we put the error check in :)
2019-10-08T15:19:43  <Justin_o> yes, true
2019-10-08T15:20:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - one other interesting consequence struck me recently of implementing https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6372
2019-10-08T15:20:56  <Bosmon> Which is that this would enable us to write the so-called "Infusion coverage checker"
2019-10-08T15:21:21  <Bosmon> I've been worried from time to time that as we implement a new model for programming, we need to reimplement all the tools which we used to rely on in the old world
2019-10-08T15:22:07  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf is hard at work on linting tools in the guise of his "component validator" etc., but I have noticed from time to time the number of components we have which have a lot of options which are never actually evaluated during their main lifetime
2019-10-08T15:22:19  <Bosmon> And the more logic we start to write declaratively, the harder it becomes to track this
2019-10-08T15:22:37  <Justin_o> yes, that's true
2019-10-08T15:23:06  <Justin_o> any chance that proxies will make debugging easier?
2019-10-08T15:23:32  <Bosmon> Justin_o - not really
2019-10-08T15:23:38  <Bosmon> Only our dreamed-of authoring tools will do that
2019-10-08T15:25:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, looking forward to that reality :)

2019-10-08T19:12:17  <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli the-t-in-rtf : From our discussion this morning, this is my existing PR, that despite the name, has the stuff for username/password clientCredential documents. I put the larger migration framework I was working on in a derived pull so it wouldn't clutter this up (luckily).  Depending on what the plan is, I can bring this up to master and add a simpler one-off migration like the other one in
2019-10-08T19:12:17  <sgithens> universal/scripts and then we should be able to use it for the account logins.
