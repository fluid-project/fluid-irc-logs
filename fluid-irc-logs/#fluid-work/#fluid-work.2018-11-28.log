2018-11-28T08:07:15  <dandimitrov> hey, jhernandez, the gpii-universal is needed for the error messages
2018-11-28T08:10:06  <dandimitrov> and using a simple script without Grunt sounds reasonable as weâ€™re not using much of gruntâ€™s toolkit

2018-11-28T08:21:23  <jhernandez> FYI, in relation to the problem when compiling the message bundles we discussed yesterday
2018-11-28T08:22:13  <jhernandez> I issued a pull request that moves the compiling out of the gruntfile
2018-11-28T08:22:36  <jhernandez> this way we can call directly the script from electron
2018-11-28T08:23:13  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/68
2018-11-28T08:23:59  <jhernandez> let me know if you see any inconvenient with using this approach
2018-11-28T08:40:18  <dandimitrov> jhernandez: great, thanks
2018-11-28T09:29:12  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: hey, thanks for the feedback

2018-11-28T09:30:17  <jhernandez> anything against creating a folder called "scripts" that include these two new files?
2018-11-28T09:31:31  <dandimitrov> yep, we should probably have a dedicated folder for executable scripts
2018-11-28T09:55:54  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: okay, I've updated the pr, let me know if that works better for you
2018-11-28T10:01:07  <jhernandez> thanks for the review, hope that it helps you to keep going :)

2018-11-28T12:04:18  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: should I remove the tags form the pulls which reviews have been addressed? I think we don't have a convention yet for that
2018-11-28T12:12:43  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, the convention is that you remove the tag :)
2018-11-28T12:13:04  <Bosmon> Do let me know which ones are ready for another look
2018-11-28T12:13:39  <javjarfer[m]> great! Didn't knew it, will remove the tags and paste here the names, thanks!

2018-11-28T14:21:09  <the-t-in-rtf> It does a few small things behind the scenes that will also be handled for you in real life, namely appending the schema URL for our GSS language, and then transforming the message bundles in the output into user-facing wording.
2018-11-28T14:21:39  <the-t-in-rtf> you should just be able to write schema definitions there in the same way they'd appear in the SR.

2018-11-28T21:28:21  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: not sure if you are online at the moment. I just noticed that there was a linting issue in one of the JSON files that I updated, but it wasn't caught by our linting. It was caught when i tried to make a dev release though.  You can see that there is a missing comma at the end of this line https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/lib/thirdPartyDependencies.json#L88
2018-11-28T21:28:32  <Justin_o> is that something that we can check with linting?
2018-11-28T21:29:32  <the-t-in-rtf1> it is, the only reason it's not caught is probably an overly broad "lib" exclusion
2018-11-28T21:29:45  <the-t-in-rtf1> (that'd be my guess at any rate)
2018-11-28T21:30:47  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: ah.. that's interesting
2018-11-28T21:32:15  <Justin_o> let me see if i can modify the lintAll config to catch that file
2018-11-28T21:32:23  <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, that would be my advice
2018-11-28T21:34:12  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: we have ""!./src/**/lib/**/*.json"" which seems to be skipping it even though I'm explicitly adding it
2018-11-28T21:34:21  <Justin_o> does the order in the array matter?
2018-11-28T21:34:32  <the-t-in-rtf1> depends who's doing the filtering
2018-11-28T21:34:42  <the-t-in-rtf1> minimatch prioritises negated first
2018-11-28T21:34:43  <Justin_o> hmm
2018-11-28T21:34:54  <the-t-in-rtf1> so it trumps other stuff
2018-11-28T21:35:07  <the-t-in-rtf1> there is an excludes option within the lint-all plugin that you can use
2018-11-28T21:36:34  <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all#global-ignores
2018-11-28T21:36:40  <the-t-in-rtf1> not sure if that will make things any easier
2018-11-28T21:36:55  <the-t-in-rtf1> probably you need to break out the list of things to exclude more finely.
2018-11-28T21:37:18  <the-t-in-rtf1> in rare cases we end up almost with a full listing, like in the nyc config in universal
2018-11-28T21:37:40  <Justin_o> yes, i guess what i want is to exclude everything from the lib directory except that one file

2018-11-28T21:48:00  <the-t-in-rtf1> there are only so many levels of negation and exceptions
2018-11-28T21:48:06  <the-t-in-rtf1> the bang operator is the last line
2018-11-28T21:48:15  <the-t-in-rtf1> you can't make exceptions once you get to that point.
2018-11-28T21:49:41  <the-t-in-rtf1> probably a more verbose listing is your only way past it
2018-11-28T21:49:48  <the-t-in-rtf1> but you can at least limit that to the json config
2018-11-28T21:50:09  <the-t-in-rtf1> anyway, very late here, good luck, send me a note if you can't get it working
