2020-05-20T12:53:59  <Justin_o> greatislander: you might be interested in this issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=933519
2020-05-20T12:56:06  <Justin_o> so it sounds like chrome will translate aria-label and other translatable attributes now. However, the Google translate API still doesn't. I hope that in time these translation services will support translating these attributes https://w3c.github.io/aria/#translatable-states-and-properties but I suppose time will tell.

2020-05-20T14:07:08  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'm inclined to start with the aria-hidden approach and we can see how things work with some testing. We may also want to file a new issue about having the component handle more parts and may want to incorporate the icons with that work. What do you think about that?

2020-05-20T14:49:16  <sachin10101998> I'm keeping the '>' and '<' out of the <a> tag as the documentation states that aria-hidden cannot be used on focusable elements. Would that be ok?

2020-05-20T14:51:42  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I was reading that too, but I think it's okay because it isn't the only item within the focusable element. But we'll need to test the experience. The problem with removing it from the `<a>` is that you won't be able to interact with it to trigger a page change. I think if the aria-hidden in the `<a>` is a problem we'll need to look at either another option and/or using an icon.
2020-05-20T14:52:31  <sachin10101998> I'll make the commit for you to test and if i doesn't suit our needs we can switch to icons.

2020-05-20T16:06:10  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: taking a look at the issue you filed, but in a meeting at the moment.. might be a bit delayed
2020-05-20T16:08:15  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: regarding FLUID-6502 I was actually thinking of something more along the lines of what's in the "In the long term..." paragraph of this comment https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6454?focusedCommentId=41524&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-41524
2020-05-20T16:08:44  <sachin10101998> No problem. I'd look at it.
2020-05-20T16:10:16  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: that may or may not include using icons

2020-05-20T16:57:05  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: at the moment the expectation is that the previous and next buttons are provided completely through the markup to the component. The only thing the component does is bind event handlers. We could expand the component to also render the text, possibly add classes for styling, and set aria attributes as needed

2020-05-20T19:42:26  <sachin10101998> Justin_o The Search logic is somehow trimming only the last part of url and adding search.html/?qs="query-string" to it. It seems that in order to show results it has to strip the URL first till it's equal to infusion/development. The search logic is being handled by mini-search.js where the submitOnEnter function gives the query input and searchURL to perform the search
2020-05-20T19:43:12  <sachin10101998> havea a look at this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/static/js/mini-search.js

2020-05-20T20:01:23  <Justin_o> is there a specific line in that file that you'd like me to look at?
2020-05-20T20:03:00  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: ^

2020-05-20T20:07:34  <sachin10101998> not yet. still understanding how the search is working. I was wondering if you already figured out why is it showing not found when the URL had parts beyond infusion/development.
2020-05-20T20:10:05  <sachin10101998> the problem is probably with line 16 of mini-search.js
2020-05-20T20:15:40  <sachin10101998> or maybe it's in the layout itself
2020-05-20T20:21:53  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: you're probably right about line 16 and 17. Or that the targetUrl option should be set based one the page it's used on. It looks like it doesn't take into consideration that some pages are nested in subdirectory
2020-05-20T20:22:40  <gmoss> sachin10101998: since line 16 of mini-search is appending the search term querystring to the `targetUrl` option, and since `targetUrl` is only ever configured as "search.html", the redirect is relative to the current page, as Justin_o said
2020-05-20T20:22:49  <gmoss> (i started writing that before he replied :P)
2020-05-20T20:23:12  <sachin10101998> haha yes
2020-05-20T20:23:38  <Justin_o> gmoss: :) thanks, your explanation is more detailed anyways
2020-05-20T20:28:16  <sachin10101998> although it's interesting to nite that mini search works at https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/index-tutorials.html
2020-05-20T20:28:25  <sachin10101998> and https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/index-components.html
2020-05-20T20:29:03  <sachin10101998> it's just sub directories which cause the problem
2020-05-20T20:32:36  <sachin10101998> let me see if I can get a work around for redirecting it to root

2020-05-20T21:50:10  <sachin10101998> I found a workaround but I don't know why it is working
2020-05-20T21:50:16  <sachin10101998> or why it should be working
2020-05-20T21:50:39  <gmoss> sachin10101998: you've piqued my interest. what's the workaround?
2020-05-20T21:50:58  <sachin10101998> I added search.md file to the sub directories
2020-05-20T21:51:28  <sachin10101998> the lunr is supposed to be searching in the root of the folder for considering all search possibilities
2020-05-20T21:51:38  <sachin10101998> But still it shows all the possible results with this
2020-05-20T21:53:34  <gmoss> curious
2020-05-20T21:53:35  <sachin10101998> I am not even sure if it would work on some other environment or is it just mine
2020-05-20T21:53:50  <sachin10101998> I've sent a PR though for the same. It would be great if you could test if it works for you too

2020-05-20T21:57:21  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I haven't tested it yet, but I think it's working because the "category" value in those search.md files is set to "Search", so it satisfies this condition in the default layout: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/113cbd7b9ef106c821698fea4f6503d601ba2a02/src/layouts/default.html.handlebars#L27-L33
2020-05-20T21:57:21  <gmoss> From there, it loads in the scripts with the correct relative URLs
2020-05-20T21:58:15  <sachin10101998> Yeah I guess that's why
2020-05-20T21:58:40  <sachin10101998> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fWhNJE2zhyoioRgOfaEcNjstNEC1l7f-/view
2020-05-20T22:02:09  <sachin10101998> Another surprising thing is that now if I delete newly created search.md from one of the folders, it still works !!!
2020-05-20T22:02:25  <gmoss> hmm that's weird. Maybe there's some caching happening in your browser or the server?
2020-05-20T22:02:40  <sachin10101998> I checked the cache and cleared everything
2020-05-20T22:02:50  <sachin10101998> restarted the server too

2020-05-20T22:04:51  <sachin10101998> It's weird that the number of folders in src/documents/ is more than number of subsections in the left hand column of navbar on clicking tutorials on top right side of  the website
2020-05-20T22:04:54  <sachin10101998> maybe that's why
2020-05-20T22:10:14  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I believe the table of contents on the left-hand side of the page is determined by `site-structure.json`, so it seems it's hardcoded
2020-05-20T22:10:59  <sachin10101998> Alright. That's why creating search.md files everywhere makes everything works.
2020-05-20T22:11:38  <sachin10101998> if floe and fluid gets migrated fast and the project is completed soon, I can start working on migrating infusion docs
2020-05-20T22:12:04  <sachin10101998> I tried to find some plugin to some partials to make this work but there was none
2020-05-20T22:12:27  <gmoss> sachin10101998: https://docpad.bevry.me/start/overview#the-out-directory
2020-05-20T22:12:37  <gmoss> this explains why it continued to work
2020-05-20T22:12:53  <sachin10101998> woahhhhh
2020-05-20T22:13:02  <sachin10101998> Good catch gmoss
2020-05-20T22:13:12  <gmoss> :)
2020-05-20T22:13:27  <gmoss> I think I've run into this in the past, years ago
2020-05-20T22:13:38  <gmoss> *this = a file was deleted but continued to wrok
2020-05-20T22:13:41  <gmoss> *work
2020-05-20T22:13:56  <sachin10101998> ohhh yeah got it
2020-05-20T22:15:06  <gmoss> anyway, don't stress too much over fixing this bug, since it may simply go away once we update the docs site to another SSG. It's possible we'll have someone else working on that site, btw, so you can focus on Fluid and FLOE sites :)
2020-05-20T22:15:20  <sachin10101998> That's great.
2020-05-20T22:15:35  <sachin10101998> We have the meeting scheduled for today, right?
2020-05-20T22:15:42  <sachin10101998> (tomorrow for EDT i guess)
2020-05-20T22:16:20  <gmoss> sachin10101998: tomorrow for me ;) but yes, 13:00 EDT, so I think that's 22:30 IST
2020-05-20T22:16:42  <sachin10101998> Yeah. Its around 4am yet. I'll see you soon
2020-05-20T22:16:52  <gmoss> sachin10101998: cheers, talk to you "tomorrow" :)
