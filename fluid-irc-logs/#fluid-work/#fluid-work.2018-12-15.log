2018-12-15T12:23:25  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - so, I think one leak is in our defaults cache, which we can fix
2018-12-15T12:23:37  <Bosmon> Another leak is within pouchDB itself, right in the core: https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/packages/node_modules/pouchdb-mapreduce/src/evalFunctionInVm.js#L42
2018-12-15T12:23:48  <Bosmon> As far as I can tell, every map function sent into here will leak
2018-12-15T12:24:34  <Bosmon> My suggestion is that we abandon the use of pouchDB immediately : P
2018-12-15T12:53:55  <Bosmon> OK
2018-12-15T12:54:12  <Bosmon> Looks like the main leak source isn't entirely unrelated to Windows
2018-12-15T12:54:24  <Bosmon> In that I imagine what is happening is that under Windows, this branch never executes: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/blob/master/src/js/pouchdb-node.js#L145
2018-12-15T12:54:38  <Bosmon> The component should destroy itself, but never does
2018-12-15T12:55:20  <Bosmon> These "dbComponents" just pile up endlessly: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/blob/master/src/js/pouch-express.js#L154
