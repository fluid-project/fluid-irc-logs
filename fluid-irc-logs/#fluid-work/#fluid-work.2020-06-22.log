2020-06-22T15:35:44  <dogeman> gmoss the first phase evaluations are closing in. Is there anything else you want me to do apart from the already submitted PRs for the first phase? I am currently working on the starter kit for 11ty based fluidic sites.

2020-06-22T16:00:42  <gmoss> dogeman: I can't think of anything that I would require prior to the first evals! I'm likely to re-review your PR's in the next day or two, but I won't say that you "need" to have everything solved for the evaluation, since we seem to be quite a bit ahead of schedule :)
2020-06-22T16:00:42  <gmoss> jhung and colinclark may have other thoughts on the matter, of course
2020-06-22T16:01:05  <jhung> dogeman thanks for keeping me in the loop. I'm occupied with another project that's finishing at the end of this month. I'm going to have to rely on the others to pick up where I'm unable to.
2020-06-22T16:15:23  <dogeman> gmoss that's great.
2020-06-22T16:17:17  <dogeman> not a problem jhung. Iam maintaining github gists for the work being done. You can go through them to quickly pick up details about the project.
2020-06-22T17:00:30  <Justin_o> gtirloni: by the way, this is the site performance tool I mentioned at standup... might be interesting for you https://www.sitespeed.io
2020-06-22T18:46:50  <gtirloni> Justin_o: thanks, pretty cool. If you need to test from various places, https://webpagetest.org is nice too
2020-06-22T18:55:00  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for sharing
2020-06-22T19:14:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: I sent you a PR for the Reorderer focusing https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/pull/32
2020-06-22T19:14:50  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome, I'll check it out right now
2020-06-22T19:16:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: it's a small change, but I think it provides the desired behaviour
2020-06-22T19:17:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: works great in Chrome! going to test Firefox and Edge 44 now
2020-06-22T19:17:50  <gmoss> I'm glad it's such a quick fix. I was fiddling with the `selectables` selector and wasn't making any headway, I guess I missed that option
2020-06-22T19:19:03  <gmoss> Justin_o: works great in the other browsers too. Awesome :)
2020-06-22T19:20:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm glad the option existed, I though I was going to have to rewrite a bunch of the functions, but someone factored that part nicely :)
2020-06-22T22:04:03  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: a quick tip about docker, if you're running out of disk space maybe try running `docker system prune`. it'll remove unused images, containers, etc
2020-06-22T22:04:12  <gtirloni> i've just freed 35GB here O_o
