2019-04-10T14:49:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to give you a shout out after your discussion yesterday on static sites.
2019-04-10T14:49:51  <the-t-in-rtf> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Technology_Evaluation_-_Static_Site_Searchhttps://wiki.gpii.net/w/Technology_Evaluation_-_Static_Site_Search

2019-04-10T14:50:30  <the-t-in-rtf> Although I know you are on the mailing lists I sent the note to earlier, I was hoping in particular to get your input.
2019-04-10T14:53:07  <alanharnum> thanks t-in-rtf, having a look

2019-04-10T17:30:31  <sgithens> bryan_: I was thinking from yesterday, and to simplify things you really just need the windows and universal repo's for this.  If you can take the same branches from the gpii-app, and just check them out on their own, it will probably simplifiy your setup for this

2019-04-10T17:38:27  <bryan_> You mean the windows and universal branches that get installed as part of your branch for gpii-app?
2019-04-10T17:38:31  <bryan_> Makes sense
