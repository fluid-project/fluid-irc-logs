2019-08-29T15:21:37  <Bosmon3> Hey there christop_ :)
2019-08-29T15:21:46  <christop_> Hello hello!
2019-08-29T15:21:52  <Bosmon3> Wanted to welcome you here, to start with, in case noone had done so so far : P
2019-08-29T15:22:18  <christop_> Thanks!
2019-08-29T15:22:28  <Bosmon3> So, stegru - christop_ had a question about how we accurately characterise inserted USB devices in order to determine whether they are relevant holders of user keys
2019-08-29T15:22:36  <Bosmon3> And what I can do so far is to point him at this bit of code - https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/usb.js#L65
2019-08-29T15:22:53  <Bosmon3> But I thought you might have a bit more to say about the issue, especially in a cross-platform sense which might make sense on MacOS
2019-08-29T15:23:08  <stegru> ok
2019-08-29T15:23:17  <Bosmon3> And I think this issue is also subtly different to the related issue of what USB drives we open based on the funny button which Gregg asked for in the QS
2019-08-29T15:24:45  <stegru> I can't think of anything to say, do you have a specific question?
2019-08-29T15:25:11  <stegru> I mean, I don't imagine this to be a good candidate for cross-platform
2019-08-29T15:26:01  <Bosmon3> christop_ - and, in parallel, here is the current implementation for proximity detection - https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/proximity.cs#L60
2019-08-29T15:26:19  <christop_> Hi stegru, just reviewed the code...
2019-08-29T15:26:29  <stegru> this detects if a device is added, and checks if the device is some type of volume
2019-08-29T15:26:33  <christop_> It looks like, for USB devices, we're specifically looking for mass storage devices (drives), correct?
2019-08-29T15:26:59  <stegru> yes - any type of storage device
2019-08-29T15:27:12  <christop_> Okay, super.
2019-08-29T15:27:13  <Bosmon3> And, christop_ - here's the getUserUsbDrives you were asking about - https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js#L1876
2019-08-29T15:27:14  <stegru> which can be added on-the-fly
2019-08-29T15:28:18  <christop_> Thanks stegru and Bosmon3.
2019-08-29T15:28:37  <stegru> both the usb and proximity ask (in different ways) the OS to send some sort of notification when one of these devices have arrived
2019-08-29T15:29:06  <christop_> NFC on macOS might be a little bit different than on Windows depending on whether the card appears as an input to an already-enumerated NFC reader device...or as a new device itself.
2019-08-29T15:29:16  <stegru> well..
2019-08-29T15:29:24  <stegru> (hold on)
2019-08-29T15:29:29  <christop_> Holding.  Thanks :)

2019-08-29T15:30:54  <stegru> you can ignore the "proximity" listener, as this was specific to built-in NFC listeners on windows
2019-08-29T15:31:07  <stegru> the "pcsc" uses external listeners.. https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/pcsc.js

2019-08-29T15:31:16  <stegru> and that's probably cross-platform
2019-08-29T15:31:34  <Bosmon3> awesome, thanks stegru
2019-08-29T15:31:35  <stegru> external readers, i meant
2019-08-29T15:31:49  <christop_> Okay, so it's using PCSC...
2019-08-29T15:31:53  <stegru> yep
2019-08-29T15:32:53  <stegru> the actual library is loaded in the windows repo: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/pcsc.js
2019-08-29T15:33:29  <christop_> xplat, pcsc-lite.
2019-08-29T15:33:31  <stegru> because it required a windows-specific check on a services
2019-08-29T15:33:37  <christop_> Okay, the work may already be done, which would be awesome.
2019-08-29T15:34:06  <stegru> "his library uses system PC/SC API. On Windows and macOS it works out of the box, but on Linux you have to do some steps as described here"
2019-08-29T15:34:14  <christop_> I'll focus on the USB side for now, and then when we hook up the auto-personalization code from Morphic we can address any macOS peculiarities, if there are any.
2019-08-29T15:34:20  <christop_> Okay, that's great info stegru.
2019-08-29T15:34:24  <christop_> Thanks so much for the pointers!
2019-08-29T15:34:32  <stegru> ok
2019-08-29T15:34:42  <christop_> Do we have any plans to support custom USB devices (WinUSB or HID) that aren't drives?
2019-08-29T15:35:03  <Bosmon3> My feeling is, not within the scope of this project
2019-08-29T15:35:08  <christop_> Okay, super.
2019-08-29T15:35:09  <christop_> I'm all set.
2019-08-29T15:35:12  <christop_> Thanks again to both of you.
2019-08-29T15:35:30  <Bosmon3> Simply getting feature parity in MacOS with what we have on Windows would be simply astonishing : P
2019-08-29T15:36:15  <stegru> just a single feature would be great
2019-08-29T15:36:27  <Bosmon3> Indeed
2019-08-29T15:36:34  <christop_> We have "open USB drives" and "eject USB drives" in the test mule now.  At last a good start?
2019-08-29T15:36:41  <christop_> * at least
2019-08-29T15:37:09  <Bosmon3> Even getting the system to simply start up, with a set of completely non-functional buttons but with an operable UI, would be great :)
2019-08-29T15:37:12  <Bosmon3> Great start, yes
2019-08-29T15:39:19  <Justin_o> christop_: thanks for the demo at the architecture meeting yesterday. Where can I download the test mule from?
2019-08-29T15:39:34  <christop_> "BUILD > macOS > API Test Mule > bin"
2019-08-29T15:39:50  <christop_> Or " ../src/latest" if you prefer.
2019-08-29T15:40:25  <christop_> Also: hello, Justin_o.  Glad to meet you yesterday too.

2019-08-29T15:49:15  <gmoss> IIRC this is the method that fluid.textToSpeech uses to generate the speech
2019-08-29T15:51:31  <gmoss> Justin_o: can confirm it is working in Edge 44 on both the production and dev storytelling tool sites
2019-08-29T15:56:28  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, I'll test those out, and see if it works. it could be something with my vm.. also yes, I test out Infusion's orator and related tts in Edge and it does work there
2019-08-29T15:59:27  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah maybe it's VM related, either way hopefully it's nothing too complicated to figure out!
2019-08-29T16:01:08  <Justin_o> haha I hope not

2019-08-29T16:27:55  <Justin_o> I'm guessing that something from the tests is messing up the TTS. But not sure.
