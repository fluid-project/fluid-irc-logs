2020-03-21T11:50:09  <sachin10101998> HarshSingh[m]: Incremental SSGs are those which can help us migrate our website in a step wise process. You can migrate half of site an incremental SSG and the other half would keep working with the present framework or technologies.
2020-03-21T11:50:21  <dmahajan980> @dev-shubham1 Mentors are not available during the weekends. Try contacting them on Monday.
2020-03-21T11:50:47  <dev-shubham1> Okay thanks !
2020-03-21T11:50:58  <sachin10101998> HarshSingh[m] what you did in https://github.com/Harshmaster/Migrate-Floe_Project_HUGO is not what's considered under incremental approach.This is because skipped rest of the content from the main FLOE repo and only migrated half of the websie.
2020-03-21T11:51:50  <sachin10101998> HarshSingh[m] : FLUID project is built using Docpad which hasn't been maintained after 2014 and its servers were taken down in 2018
2020-03-21T11:52:28  <sachin10101998> This led to a lot of dependency issues and its non compatible with lots of new version of 'things'. therefore the project aims at migrating to a new and modern SSG
2020-03-21T11:53:04  <sachin10101998> Hope that helps.

2020-03-21T12:23:02  <sachin10101998> that's something we have to figure out and propose. HarshSingh[m]
2020-03-21T12:24:33  <HarshSingh[m]> sachin10101998: and could you please tell me a little more about incremental approch ? I was just automatingNEWS and Resources tabs in my proposal. ? Is there something more to in incremental approach with FLOE Project .
2020-03-21T12:28:35  <sachin10101998> HarshSingh[m] I am myself working on the project just like you. If you want to know about incremental approach, gatsby and 11ty are a few examples. Although since we have enough time during the gsoc period, i'm not sure if the incremental property of gatsby or 11ty should be a major factor in deciding ssg as the sites would stay live from their current sources only
2020-03-21T12:29:01  <sachin10101998> I'm not sure what exactly you mean by automating news hough
