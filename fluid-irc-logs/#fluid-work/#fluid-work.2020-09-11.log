2020-09-11T15:50:39  <clown> danielcho:  according to wikipedia, chess boards are, e.g., a1, c5, etc.  Rows are numbered, and columns are lettered.

2020-09-11T15:51:12  <danielcho> thanks clown! :)
2020-09-11T15:51:17  <clown> no problem.
2020-09-11T16:33:47  <Uttara> philip: Hey! are you around today?
2020-09-11T16:34:09  <philip> Uttara: Yep. Do you want to meet?
2020-09-11T16:34:59  <Uttara>  philip: can you share your design sketch from Tuesday with me.  I am implementing some changes in Figma
2020-09-11T16:36:16  <philip> Uttara: I've put some pictures in the accessibility map google doc under "Data workflow". Are those good enough?
2020-09-11T16:36:46  <Uttara> philip: yes that works!
2020-09-11T16:36:54  <Uttara> thanks
2020-09-11T16:39:55  <philip> Uttara: Great. If you have any time today, I'd like to meet and talk about how I can be helpful in the design process for the map
2020-09-11T16:41:02  <Uttara> Philip: I was actually thinking of finishing off early today and use some of my welness wednesday hours. Does Monday work for you? MAy be after the standup?
2020-09-11T16:41:25  <philip> Uttara: Yep, no problem
2020-09-11T19:14:39  <Bosmon> WELNES!
2020-09-11T19:15:02  <Bosmon> I wonder how chess notation came up
2020-09-11T20:06:03  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: could someone give me access to edit fluid's calendar?
2020-09-11T20:10:58  <cindyli> i can view permission settings of fluid team calendar but don't have privilege to grant permission. sorry
2020-09-11T20:15:03  <gtirloni> np
2020-09-11T20:18:51  <gmoss> Bosmon: danielcho had encountered some odd text-to-speech patterns with a grid system he's been developing, where it would read "2 C" as "2 degrees Celsius", and we were discussing alternatives in the daily check-in call. Just before we signed off, he'd asked what chess notation used :)
2020-09-11T20:19:39  <danielcho> Coding to Learn and Create project's coding environment has a board that looks like a chees board :)
2020-09-11T20:19:49  <danielcho> chess*
2020-09-11T20:20:40  <danielcho> it was Mac's VoiceOver's unexpected behaviour on US English locale
2020-09-11T20:21:45  <Bosmon> Hahaha
2020-09-11T20:22:09  <Bosmon> Interestingly algebraic chess notation uses just the same system that spreadsheets use.... just the coordinates are the other way up
2020-09-11T20:22:26  <Bosmon> I doubt you'd want to read out grid coordinates using "descriptive" notation : P
2020-09-11T20:23:22  <danielcho> yeah, gmoss mentioned about spreadsheets notation during today standup as well
2020-09-11T20:24:33  <gtirloni> quite the stretch from voiceover to think that 2C is 2 degrees Celsius, I'd say
2020-09-11T20:24:48  <Bosmon> People love to make systems that are "intelligent" :)
2020-09-11T20:25:20  <danielcho> interestingly enough, the behaviour was different based on which voice I choose
2020-09-11T20:26:07  <Bosmon> I've just escaped from a project that would put features like that into a system at the drop of a hat ....
2020-09-11T20:26:09  <danielcho> this is what I documented: "Alex, Victoria and Fred read character ‘C’ or ‘F’ after a numerical value as “Degree Celcious” and “Degree Fahrenheit”."
2020-09-11T20:26:14  <gtirloni> reading 2°C as Celsius would be very nice though..  but there's clearly a different symbol there
2020-09-11T20:26:31  <Bosmon> Noone knows how to type that symbol : P
2020-09-11T20:26:36  <gtirloni> LOL
2020-09-11T20:26:40  <danielcho> haha
2020-09-11T20:26:43  <Bosmon> Much like the one that denotes the European currency, that I always cut and paste from a web page
2020-09-11T20:26:47  * gtirloni laughs in pt_BR keyboard layout
2020-09-11T20:27:24  <Bosmon> I even have that symbol floating next to the number 4 on this keyboard but I gave no idea how to produce it
2020-09-11T20:27:49  <Bosmon> Oh there it is, it's just that this IRC client is too old to reproduce it : P
2020-09-11T20:27:59  <gtirloni> to be honest, I googled it
2020-09-11T20:28:00  <gtirloni> :)
2020-09-11T20:28:26  <gtirloni> pt_BR layout is supposed to have it, but I'm using an american keyboard with dead keys enabled
2020-09-11T20:29:40  <gtirloni> danielcho: do Alex, Victoria and Fred ready 0x123 as hexadecimal? :)
2020-09-11T20:29:44  <gtirloni> *read
2020-09-11T20:29:55  <danielcho> lol I wonder
2020-09-11T20:33:45  <gmoss> It'll probably just throw in a "degrees Celsius" :P
2020-09-11T20:34:48  <danielcho> read as "Zero by one hundred twenty three" :P
2020-09-11T20:35:43  <gmoss> :D
2020-09-11T20:36:09  <danielcho> also space made a difference where "2C" gets read as expected, and "2 C" is what gets read as degrees celsius
2020-09-11T20:36:27  <danielcho> but I changed the notation to Column first and the number now :)
