2020-02-29T07:51:45  <the-t-in-rtf> @chaitanya, the IDRC is where a lot of members of the Fluid community work, but the Fluid project is used in other places as well.
2020-02-29T07:52:19  <the-t-in-rtf> The team at the IDRC kindly have organised the community's participation in GSoC, but community members from around the world are participating.
