2020-04-07T11:56:44  <the-t-in-rtf> @dmahajan980 had a question I wanted to answer here
2020-04-07T11:56:55  *** Bosmon3 <Bosmon3!~Bosmon3@148.252.29.206> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-07T11:57:04  <the-t-in-rtf> "I had a doubt about injecting listeners to an event from somewhere else in the tree.
2020-04-07T11:57:04  <the-t-in-rtf> What would happen if multiple subcomponents inject different listeners to the same event? I mean, will only one of them be attached to the event and which one would it be?"
2020-04-07T11:57:15  <the-t-in-rtf> The key is to "namespace" the listener
2020-04-07T11:57:28  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if you always use "onEvent" as you listener definition "key"
2020-04-07T11:57:55  <the-t-in-rtf> then the event listener definition will be a combination of the original and whatever grade is overriding that
2020-04-07T11:58:29  <the-t-in-rtf> So if you namespace that, as in "onEvent.doMyThing", you avoid a lot of potential collisions
2020-04-07T11:59:05  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. someone has to really want to change your specific listener/behaviour rather than running into problems simply adding their own listener
2020-04-07T11:59:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I can paste examples later if it would be helpful

2020-04-07T12:03:32  <dmahajan980> Thanks @the-t-in-rtf for the answer. But I wanted to know if someone does it without using namespaces then will there be any error? And if not, then what would be the possible listener to the event?
2020-04-07T12:09:27  <dmahajan980> By error, I mean the errors that the program will throw. Although, this practice will definitely create collisions and doesn't seem appropriate, but just wanted to know more about Infusion's mechanism.

2020-04-07T12:48:35  <the-t-in-rtf> sure, it's also possible that you would want to update a listener in place
2020-04-07T12:48:45  <the-t-in-rtf> which isn't an error
2020-04-07T12:49:15  <the-t-in-rtf> so you might distribute a listener to all your child components for example, that fires after their onCreate event and does something
2020-04-07T12:49:59  <the-t-in-rtf> that's probably not a great example
2020-04-07T12:50:08  <the-t-in-rtf> as people commonly bind to onCreate, and you'd really want to namespace that one

2020-04-07T15:01:05  <philip> colinclark, gmoss: picking up on yesterday's conversation, I think I'm in need of another mechanism. In the example at https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs, there's an execution path where users need to finish client authorization by visiting a URL and pasting a code from there into the console. Since this component will be running on a Nexus server, likely inside a VM, I'm not sure how I would get the code in there
2020-04-07T15:03:39  <philip> (The relevant bit of the example code is the function getNewToken)

2020-04-07T16:35:55  <simonjb> thanks
2020-04-07T16:36:56  <gmoss> colinclark simonjb: we do have design crit today. I proposed in planning that we could use the time then to discuss the matter if we get through the primary topic in good time (i'm assuming we're talking about the security thing). either way, just letting you know the crit is happening :)
2020-04-07T16:37:12  <colinclark> I’d like to catch up with simonjb
2020-04-07T16:37:26  <colinclark> and then we can come up with a time for a meeting with those who are impacted
2020-04-07T16:37:31  <colinclark> including you gmoss
2020-04-07T16:37:32  <colinclark> later today
2020-04-07T16:37:39  <colinclark> I’m aware of the crit
2020-04-07T16:38:45  <philip> cindyli, did you have time today to take a look at my asynchronous Infusion code?
2020-04-07T16:39:57  <philip> *do you have time today
2020-04-07T16:40:37  <cindyli> sure, philip
2020-04-07T16:41:23  <philip> I'm going to do lunch now. I'm up for it any time after that
2020-04-07T16:42:16  <cindyli> same here, philip. i will ping you when i'm ready. you can ping me too when you are

2020-04-07T17:25:43  <Justin_o> cindyli, greatislander: I have a couple of comments related to https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/155 I don't think they are blockers for the site though, and may require some investigation. How would you like to track those. I can just leave them as a comment on the PR and we can look into later, we can discuss here, or something else
2020-04-07T17:31:11  <cindyli> Justin_o: either way sounds good. i feel if the comments needs back and forth discussion, let's talk here and add comments or tickets once things are clarified. otherwise, leaving comments on the pull request sounds good too

2020-04-07T17:39:52  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, I'll just leave them as things we can look into later.
2020-04-07T17:40:34  <greatislander> Justin_o that PR needs a follow-up ticket, so if you would be willing to start one with any non-blocking comments that would be awesome
2020-04-07T17:41:28  <Justin_o> greatislander: what's the follow up for?
2020-04-07T17:43:40  <greatislander> Supporting custom preview images for each post if the post has a featured image, creating custom og descriptions, etc
2020-04-07T17:43:46  <greatislander> Haven’t opened it yet
2020-04-07T17:44:41  <Justin_o> greatislander: okay, I'll start something and you can modify as needed.
2020-04-07T17:44:41  <greatislander> Also related: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/158
2020-04-07T17:46:35  <Justin_o> greatislander: I might just leave my comment there actually.. it wasn't exactly what that ticket is for, but related to that part
2020-04-07T17:46:49  <Justin_o> oh actually maybe not

2020-04-07T18:00:17  <Bosmon3> Have the permissions been changed because we regard it as a sensitive vulnerability?

2020-04-07T19:45:33  <Justin_o> also I'm finding that I can't run the about page through the online validator.. is it built in a different way
2020-04-07T19:45:34  <cindyli> html?
2020-04-07T19:46:30  <greatislander> Hi justin_o et al, I'm on a platform co-op call
2020-04-07T19:46:35  <greatislander> but will check this out later
2020-04-07T19:46:36  <cindyli> it's not a static page at the moment. but it will be
2020-04-07T19:47:09  <Teddy___> https://wecount.netlify.com/ should be static
2020-04-07T19:47:26  <Justin_o> okay, so "about" and "inclusion challenges" aren't static at the moment?
2020-04-07T19:47:32  <Justin_o> but the rest are?
2020-04-07T19:47:41  <cindyli> none of them are

2020-04-07T19:50:27  <cindyli> the validator does get the content of the page. i turned on "show source" option

2020-04-07T19:55:38  <Justin_o> cindyli: did you want to review it as well, or should I just go ahead and merge?
2020-04-07T19:57:22  <sgithens> Bosmon3: For the common event bindings, I put in this example with the shorthand invoker syntax... but I'm wondering if I can put a full invoker structure in here:
2020-04-07T19:57:22  <sgithens> paragraphClick: { method: "click",
2020-04-07T19:57:22  <sgithens>     args: ["gpii.tests.binder.commonEventBindings.handleParagraphClick({arguments}.0)"]
2020-04-07T19:57:22  <sgithens> }
2020-04-07T19:58:12  <sgithens> I have this anti-pattern where I'm creating a bunch of invokers, just for the purpose of passing them in to the event bindings.  It would be nice to just put the full loaded/curried functions here
2020-04-07T19:58:47  <sgithens> as some of them need IoC resolution for their arguments outside the event object
