2019-04-23T15:14:55  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - I think that GPII-3759 just needs a few tests
2019-04-23T15:15:02  <Bosmon> I hope you had a great holiday - welcome back!
2019-04-23T15:15:11  <Bosmon> Do you think you could take a look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/955 ? Thanks!
2019-04-23T15:16:29  <gmoss> michelled cindyli: should we check in on the Storytelling Tool ahead of planning?
2019-04-23T15:16:48  <gmoss> michelled cindyli: nm i see that we've moved that to 12:30
2019-04-23T15:16:58  <michelled> gmoss: I suspect it will be slightly longer today since neither cindy nor I was around for a while ;)
2019-04-23T15:17:04  <michelled> so lets meet after
2019-04-23T15:17:09  <gmoss> sounds good

2019-04-23T20:22:43  <sgithens> Bosmon the-t-in-rtf : I'm wondering if you could take a look at this issue I'm having with some tests.  I'm trying to start-up just the local flow manager so I can test the settings capture, I'm not sure if the issue is that it can't actually resolve the component at all, or if it can resolve it, but maybe I'm not giving it the correct initialization. Or something else.
2019-04-23T20:22:43  <sgithens> https://gist.github.com/sgithens/ffb25f4f59876aaee188281d933a5d8b
2019-04-23T20:28:59  <Bosmon> sgithens - you seem to be confused between grades and instances
2019-04-23T20:31:41  <Bosmon> In general it seems something fairly dreadful has happened and someone has corrupted the creator function ....
2019-04-23T20:32:46  <Bosmon> Ah no, this is what it should look like :)
2019-04-23T20:32:57  <Bosmon> It's one of those funny creator functions that get used as namespaces, ignore my earlier remarks
2019-04-23T20:33:04  <Bosmon> Still, you have managed to corrupt the grade hierarchy somehow
2019-04-23T20:33:45  <Bosmon> Why don't you dump the defaults and take a look at what is in them
2019-04-23T20:34:21  <Bosmon> Oh wait
2019-04-23T20:34:26  <Bosmon> gpii.flowManager.local is not a component
2019-04-23T20:35:33  <Bosmon> You should really use one of the configs otherwise it is quite likely that things will become cabberwonky
2019-04-23T20:36:00  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.config.local.base.json5
2019-04-23T20:38:23  <sgithens> Bosmon: ok, but I mean, you should be able to create it as a sub component right... it just woulnd't use any of the fancy device reporter stuff or whatnot
2019-04-23T20:40:30  <sgithens> but I do want to understand the error I'm getting, looking at the defination, it inherits from fluid.contextAware, and otherwise seems like a normal thing you should be able to create a component from
2019-04-23T20:40:49  <sgithens> this is similar to how the prefserver is created in the preferencesServiceTests
2019-04-23T20:40:59  <sgithens> that need to call invokers directory from the service to test them

2019-04-23T22:38:47  <sgithens> Bosmon: You mean `fluid.contextAware` isn't a compont?
2019-04-23T22:39:04  <sgithens> I guess searching through `infusion` for it's defaults blocks I'm not seeing one
2019-04-23T22:39:59  <sgithens> oh wait here it is
2019-04-23T22:40:11  <sgithens> it's grade is.... ["{that}.check"]
2019-04-23T22:40:52  <sgithens> ok
