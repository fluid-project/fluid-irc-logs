2020-03-27T15:52:29  <mafanytande> I am Myles, a junior studying computer engineering at the University of Buea in Cameroon. I know I'm late but I'm a hardworking person. I am interested in the 'Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid' project and have completed the how to get started requirements. I look forward to working on this project. I'm ready to begin the next step.

2020-03-27T19:39:58  <batey96_> can i consider script files,layouts as part of content?..or do we leave that responsibilty to the rendering framework..blocking stone not all generators follow same pattern of laying out their content

2020-03-27T19:44:16  <batey96_> i was suggesting of allowing each generator to bring its own scripts(thereby not tight coupling the content and scripts).switching to any generator at any means that the generator is responsible for bringing its own logics(e.g its own ways of search,precaching,etc)..I dont know if am making sense

2020-03-27T19:45:50  <gmoss> batey96_: I believe you have selected a particular generator in your proposal, so I would only worry about what to do in that case. Keeping the content and scripts loosely coupled is generally always a good idea, though!
