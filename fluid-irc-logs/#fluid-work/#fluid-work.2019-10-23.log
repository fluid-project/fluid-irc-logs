2019-10-23T07:53:59  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Hi good morning! sorry, I didn't see the message yesterday
2019-10-23T07:54:17  <javjarfer[m]> I haven't forgotten it, it's just I have been focused in the new native solution I'm going to demo today!
2019-10-23T08:05:03  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - awesome!
2019-10-23T08:07:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: spoiler alert, there will be assembly and some meme about it
2019-10-23T08:07:21  <Bosmon> yow
2019-10-23T08:07:40  <javjarfer[m]> sadly I have spoiled a lot to stegru
2019-10-23T08:08:21  <javjarfer[m]> But I know he will be able to forgive me somehow
2019-10-23T08:08:50  <stegru> doubtful
2019-10-23T08:09:44  <Bosmon> OK, if you are busy preparing, we can skip the Windows meeting today
2019-10-23T08:20:50  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: that would be awesome, I'm rushing a little bit
2019-10-23T08:21:07  <javjarfer[m]> If it's okay we can have it tomorrow

2019-10-23T11:15:24  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/962#discussion_r337986436
2019-10-23T11:16:20  <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2019-10-23T11:16:26  <Bosmon> Just studying it now
2019-10-23T11:18:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, let me know if you need any more info
2019-10-23T11:24:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think this would have to be a framework bug
2019-10-23T11:24:33  <Bosmon> Although it seems we fixed https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5266 quite some time ago
2019-10-23T11:25:16  <Bosmon> Perhaps it was only fixed for static createOnEvent components rather than dynamic ones
2019-10-23T11:26:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: possibly, what about this comment from the JIRA "we might make an exception for an exact reference to just the subcomponent in question but it's hard to think of a reasonable use case for this"
2019-10-23T11:27:16  <Justin_o> Is it possible that the direct reference case wasn't handled as part of the work specified in this JIRA?
2019-10-23T11:28:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that comment is pretty strange, I can't imagine now why we might have wanted to make that exception
2019-10-23T11:29:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the merge commit for that work https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/c93609021fba9c798489df95e35164fd55f5c64a
2019-10-23T11:31:04  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, very interesting - it just looks into "components" rather than "dynamicComponents"
2019-10-23T11:31:15  <Bosmon> Another great reason why this kind of introspection is dodgy
2019-10-23T11:31:53  <Bosmon> Anyway, I'll clear out my working copy once I have fixed FLUID-6414 and take a look in more detail
2019-10-23T11:35:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks

2019-10-23T12:33:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I was just going to run to a room and open the meeting.
2019-10-23T12:33:19  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m] @Bosmon
2019-10-23T12:33:53  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, its
2019-10-23T12:34:06  <the-t-in-rtf> great!
2019-10-23T12:34:19  <javjarfer[m]> sorry about that, we talked about this is morning in the chat
2019-10-23T12:34:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I am arm deep in the logs from the last smoke tests and would rather keep working.
2019-10-23T12:34:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I see it now, thanks.
2019-10-23T12:35:14  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: haha glad that was received as good news, I should have pinged everyone this morning
2019-10-23T12:36:44  <the-t-in-rtf> My friend, I only go to those in case you need help.
2019-10-23T12:36:59  <the-t-in-rtf> If you're good without it, I am certainly good without it.

2019-10-23T12:58:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - any idea why https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/37/files/6188757f6d737e20ce64dc8e4623f894302f00f8..0dff90c0697b849aba7369b2c1e83db755dd3c07 was not necessary before?
2019-10-23T12:59:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm assume that the modelListener was fired on init
2019-10-23T12:59:46  <Bosmon> And it isn't now?
2019-10-23T13:00:04  <Justin_o> it seems that, at least now, the modelListener is only fires when a change occurs
2019-10-23T13:00:14  <Justin_o> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/37/files/6188757f6d737e20ce64dc8e4623f894302f00f8..0dff90c0697b849aba7369b2c1e83db755dd3c07#diff-a8a8430d2c6b1dccc71f80c058ccf590L100
2019-10-23T13:00:30  <Justin_o> the model listener is referencing the model from the parent component.. not sure if that's what's causing it

2019-10-23T13:04:09  <Bosmon> Seems like a likely framework bug again
2019-10-23T13:04:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. I thought that might have been an intentional change
2019-10-23T13:04:47  <Bosmon> modelListeners should always fire on init unless you have said not to
2019-10-23T13:05:01  <Bosmon> Unless the initial model value is undefined, that is, which I assume is not true in this caase

2019-10-23T13:05:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: no that is not true in this case
2019-10-23T13:05:42  <Justin_o> it does have a model value
2019-10-23T13:05:53  <Bosmon> OK, well I have two bugs to investigate now :)
2019-10-23T13:05:57  <Justin_o> :)
2019-10-23T13:06:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon: should I revert that change in my branch?
2019-10-23T13:06:45  <Bosmon> It's fine, it will just help to focus my attention where to look : P
2019-10-23T13:08:14  <Bosmon> Nunavut has just 1 MP!
2019-10-23T13:08:52  <Bosmon> And comprises 20% of Canada's land area ....

2019-10-23T13:12:32  <Justin_o> That does sound really strange. The population is under 40k though, so I wonder how spread out the population is. I could imagine that it would be hard for 1 person to travel around and meet with all the people.
2019-10-23T13:13:18  <Bosmon> Well, there are 10% as many people in Nunavut as there are in Walthamstow .......
2019-10-23T13:15:18  <Justin_o> This is old now, but also interesting. Nunavut had the second lowest population, fewest electors, but by far the largest area
2019-10-23T13:15:20  <Justin_o> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_of_Canadian_federal_ridings
2019-10-23T13:16:47  <Justin_o> contrast that with the Toronto Centre riding that is only 6km2 and has over double the population of Nunavut
2019-10-23T13:18:14  <Justin_o> it does make you wonder about representation in government though. Depending on the perspective you look at it from, it may or may not look fair.
2019-10-23T13:20:34  <Justin_o> And looking at the election results for example, https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/federal/2019/results/ you can see the regional divisions.
2019-10-23T13:21:32  <Justin_o> But if you look at the vote share, the NDP get twice as many votes as the Bloc but only about 2/3 the seats. The Green Party has almost as many votes as the Bloc but 10% of the seats.
