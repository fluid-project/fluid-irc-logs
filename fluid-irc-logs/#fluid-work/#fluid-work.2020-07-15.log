2020-07-15T11:12:43  <Justin_o> gtirloni: it looks like the wiki is down. Is it being updated?
2020-07-15T11:31:09  <gtirloni> Justin_o: not being updated, it crashed. i'm starting it again
2020-07-15T11:31:51  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-07-15T11:31:54  <gtirloni> it's back now
2020-07-15T11:32:08  <Justin_o> thanks for fixing it so quickly
2020-07-15T11:33:05  <gtirloni> np
2020-07-15T11:33:26  <gtirloni> there were many stuck threads, tomcat tried to restarted them and crashed with a stacktrace of >10 pages O_o
2020-07-15T11:57:13  <the-t-in_> @Justin_o, just making coffee and then I'll be ready
2020-07-15T11:59:17  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: okay, sounds good
2020-07-15T12:00:28  <Justin_o> cindyli, gmoss: will you still be joining us?
2020-07-15T14:22:17  <gmoss> Justin_o: I was re-reading the description for FLUID-6523 just now, and I think the issue we identified just a few minutes ago is still covered under that Jira number. I'll leave a comment on it instead of filing a new one, as they would be nearly identical
2020-07-15T14:23:57  <Justin_o> okay thanks
2020-07-15T14:26:21  <gmoss> In fact one of the original screenshots shows that issue
2020-07-15T14:26:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'll try to take a look into that specific case today. Maybe there will be something we can do prevent it.
2020-07-15T14:27:06  <gmoss> Justin_o: hopefully it's an easy fix!
2020-07-15T14:27:14  <Justin_o> hopefully ;)

2020-07-15T15:16:16  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I merged your pr from the command line, but it doesn't look like your PR merged? Is there a commit missing in what I merged? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/996
2020-07-15T15:17:50  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I had to bring FLUID-6520 into FLUID-6519 so it would build. That one is merged already... I don't see why the PR wouldn't merge though. Here it seems GitHub is stuck "Checking for ability to merge automaticallyâ€¦"
2020-07-15T15:20:35  <gtirloni> hmm quick search looks like some people have had their PR in that state for some time before it clears
2020-07-15T15:23:48  <Justin_o> gtirloni: so it should clear on its own?
2020-07-15T15:24:26  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I think so. I don't see any reason for it not clearing... the commits seem right to me. I've found some people that say it cleared after 45min, for example
2020-07-15T15:26:06  <gtirloni> really weird
2020-07-15T15:32:55  <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay, lets check back later and see what happens. I guess worse case we file an issue with GitHub
2020-07-15T15:34:02  <Justin_o> gtirloni: hmm.. seems like the same thing on this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/999
2020-07-15T15:34:11  <Justin_o> I wonder if it's related to the merge or just something on GitHub's end
2020-07-15T15:35:12  <gtirloni> status.github.com might show something soon :)
2020-07-15T15:36:58  <Justin_o> gtirloni: looks like it's only related to GitHub Actions, but maybe it's somehow related
2020-07-15T15:37:21  <Justin_o> it looks like the checks didn't run for the merge into mastert
2020-07-15T15:37:23  <Justin_o> master
2020-07-15T15:39:44  <gtirloni> yeah, status.github.com is showing degradation
2020-07-15T15:40:42  <Justin_o> if only I had merged it a few minutes earlier :(
2020-07-15T15:48:59  <Justin_o> gtirloni: now it says there is a merge conflict https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/996
2020-07-15T15:49:15  <Justin_o> let me see if I can do the merge again
2020-07-15T15:50:22  <Justin_o> gtirloni: hmm.. can't do anything maybe you can try merging master into your branch? I'm not sure..
2020-07-15T15:50:48  <gtirloni> yeah, i just ran a diff from an updated master and didn't see any differences. I'll try to merge master and push again
2020-07-15T15:51:20  <dmahajan980> The one that I created a few minutes ago still has the same status: https://github.com/fluid-lab/gamepad-navigator/pull/33
2020-07-15T15:51:52  <Justin_o>  dmahajan980: thanks.. so it does seem to be more than just the Infusion repo then
2020-07-15T15:52:02  <gtirloni> Justin_o: master merged cleaning (simple fast-forward only). pushing worked fine (without force).. PR still says there are conflicts. Super weird
2020-07-15T15:52:20  <gtirloni> s/cleaning/cleanly/
2020-07-15T15:53:01  <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay.. lets wait this out a bit longer.. I'm guessing it's a false conflict message.. it would be interesting to see what happens to my other PR and dmahajan980's.. if they both get the conflict message or just stall for a long time
2020-07-15T15:53:21  <Justin_o> gtirloni: interestingly my other one cleared https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/999
2020-07-15T15:54:19  <dmahajan980> @Justin_o: I don't think mine will show a conflict message as it already has the latest changes from the master branch.
2020-07-15T15:54:37  <gtirloni> yeah, let's wait
2020-07-15T15:54:41  <gtirloni> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/3lZFLmXI/
2020-07-15T15:55:11  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: hopefully it won't.. gtirloni's PR was literally the last one to be merged into the Infusion master which could also be why it is having an issue.
2020-07-15T15:55:47  <Justin_o> gtirloni: everything is up-to-date, if only the PR would believe that ;)
2020-07-15T15:56:18  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I wonder if it will clear on the next merge to master?
2020-07-15T15:56:37  <gtirloni> yeah, good question
2020-07-15T15:59:29  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Oh! I see. Let's wait for this for a while.
2020-07-15T16:21:25  <gtirloni> Justin_o: it doesn't look like it's going to clear itself. I checked master and everything seems to be there already. Is it fine if I close the PR?
2020-07-15T16:22:40  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I wonder if we should just wait till after the next merge to master from another PR and see if that gets it to clear itself, and if that doesn't work we just close it. Hopefully we won't have to wait too long.
2020-07-15T16:22:52  <Justin_o> cindyli: do you think you'll merge my FLUID-6525 PR?
2020-07-15T16:23:07  <gmoss> Justin_o: I've added a new commit to my SJRK-374 branch, but the PR isn't recognizing it (not yet anyway). GitHub sure is funky today
2020-07-15T16:23:35  <Justin_o> :(
2020-07-15T16:23:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: I left a comment detailing the commit either way
2020-07-15T16:24:14  <gmoss> Hopefully this gets sorted out soon! c'mon Microsoft :P
2020-07-15T16:24:18  <gtirloni> Justin_o: makes sense!
2020-07-15T16:25:01  <gtirloni> the funny thing is that they're only listing an outage for github actions, not PR's or git
2020-07-15T16:25:25  <Justin_o> gmoss: I was just thinking that since Microsoft has taken over their have been more issues and it's harder to get a hold of their support. I've sent a couple of requests to them recently and haven't had any help. But the other side is that we have a worldwide pandemic and there are a lot more features available in GitHub now.. so it's probably a bunch of factors.
2020-07-15T16:25:57  <Justin_o> ;)
2020-07-15T16:26:16  <gtirloni> it UPDATEDDD!
2020-07-15T16:26:17  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah I'm sure there are many factors we aren't even aware of
2020-07-15T16:26:50  <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, it's really strange.. I mean I guess there is some cross over but I don't know how GitHub Actions would affect determining if a PR is mergeable and what commits have been added.. but maybe they just shut down the whole pipeline to deal with the GitHub Actions issue?
2020-07-15T16:27:16  <Justin_o> gtirloni: YEAH!!!!!
2020-07-15T16:27:18  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I think I've read somewhere that they've an unified event pipeline, so yeah.. could be that
2020-07-15T16:27:40  <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, i will do some more testing on contrast ratios. if it looks fine, i'll merge it
2020-07-15T16:31:50  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. I was asking to see if that would fix the PR issue that we were seeing, but that's cleared up now.
2020-07-15T16:32:19  <Justin_o> gmoss: which browser were you using to demonstrate the issue with the FLUID-6523
2020-07-15T16:32:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: Chrome 83
2020-07-15T16:32:37  <gmoss> Win10 Pro v1909
2020-07-15T16:32:58  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-07-15T17:19:15  <sbates> When did GitHub change the "Clone or download" button to "Code"? Do you it's to subtly advertise VS Code?
2020-07-15T17:20:30  <Justin_o> sbates: I think they did a redesign of the UI a week or two ago.. I keep struggling to find where they moved everything
2020-07-15T17:22:53  <sbates> yes, maybe it was part of that redesign, I just noticed it earlier this week
2020-07-15T17:23:57  <sbates> "Clone or download" was much clearer :(
2020-07-15T17:25:00  <sbates> maybe it was too many words
2020-07-15T17:25:11  <sbates> and they wanted something shorter
2020-07-15T17:25:37  <sbates> and it just happened to match the name of one of their other products
2020-07-15T17:30:11  <dogeman> hey gmoss , we might have to rewrite the markdown posts in fluidproject because the styling is messed up in latest commit
2020-07-15T17:30:35  <dogeman> The CSS style tags which style the posts can't be added in md
2020-07-15T17:31:42  <dogeman> jhung i did the requested changes in the floe project PR. Please check
2020-07-15T17:32:45  <jhung> dogeman thanks! I'll take a look.
2020-07-15T17:32:52  <dogeman> np
2020-07-15T17:33:29  <dogeman> gmoss I added the markdown linting and it's passing as required.  Made other required changestoo in the fluid PR. Please check.
2020-07-15T17:34:45  <Justin_o> sbates: just think if Microsoft didn't buy them, it would have been called Atom
2020-07-15T17:35:02  <sbates> :)
2020-07-15T17:35:47  <Justin_o> sbates: in general I'm not a huge fan of their changes.. it took me a while to find where the link to all the commits is
2020-07-15T17:36:20  <Justin_o> but I guess it is a simpler ui now
2020-07-15T17:37:12  <gmoss> dogeman: that's great, I'll probably check it tomorrow :)
2020-07-15T17:37:18  <sbates> Justin_o: there's another update coming that's on preview at the moment
2020-07-15T17:37:38  <Justin_o> oh really.. where do you see that?
2020-07-15T17:37:45  <Justin_o> sbates: ^
2020-07-15T17:37:59  <gmoss> *the MD linter passing is great, the CSS issues are less great haha
2020-07-15T17:38:02  <Justin_o> sbates: or rather, how would I be able to see that
2020-07-15T17:38:59  <sbates> Justin_o: for me, if I click my profile icon in the top right to open the menu, there's a menu entry "Feature preview" that lets me enable and disable upcoming changes
2020-07-15T17:39:13  <Justin_o> ah okay.. let me check
2020-07-15T17:39:42  <dogeman> I'll pass the linter too. I got a hack.
2020-07-15T17:39:54  <sbates> Justin_o: this one changes where the branch and tag navigation is located
2020-07-15T17:40:20  <Justin_o> sbates: ah I think I have the feature preview enabled on mine
2020-07-15T17:40:26  <dogeman> md linter is passing in floeproject as well. I added it there too
2020-07-15T17:46:09  <gmoss> dogeman: awesome!
2020-07-15T17:47:27  <gmoss> Justin_o: The more I think about the wording and repro steps for this new Jira, the more it looks exactly like FLUID-6523. considering the aim of creating a new Jira is to say something like "part of the issue persists, but we'd like to merge in the PR", what do you think about adding an update to 6523's description and then we can merge in the PR and simply leave 6523 open?
2020-07-15T17:48:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: that's another possibility actually
2020-07-15T17:48:29  <Justin_o> just to say part was fixed and that something  is still left. I'm going to take another look at the event being sent to see if that gives any thoughts on other approaches
2020-07-15T17:49:01  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah exactly. okay, hopefully something reveals itself :) I'll add that update now and then sign off for the day
2020-07-15T17:49:20  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, have a good rest of the day
2020-07-15T17:49:25  <gmoss> cheers ;)
2020-07-15T18:37:24  <Bosmon> Wow, cindyli got pull #999 : P
2020-07-15T18:53:49  <Bosmon> Hi there gtirloni - I got a lot of what look like bogus results on my recent addition to https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/972
2020-07-15T18:54:13  <Bosmon> Is there a way to re-trigger CI like the old "ok to test" system, or some other way to get details on what went wrong?
2020-07-15T18:54:59  <gtirloni> Bosmon: hi! Yeah, on the top right corner you should see "Re-run all jobs" -- https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/972/checks?check_run_id=874636825
2020-07-15T18:55:18  <gtirloni> Bosmon: it looks like the jobs were skipped once the linter failed in one of them
2020-07-15T18:55:43  <Bosmon> gtirloni - but the linter didn't fail for a good reason
2020-07-15T18:56:10  <Bosmon> Well... perhaps there were bad linebreaks in the gruntfile that got fixed in trunk .....
2020-07-15T18:56:16  <Bosmon> I guess I should remerge and try again
2020-07-15T18:57:58  <gtirloni> I'm checking.. I remember a step to fix that
2020-07-15T18:59:59  <gtirloni> I think you're right, that's the crlf shenanigans that got fixed in the Kettle repo but I forgot to add them to the infusion PR.. I wonder why they didn't feel before though since we ran this on Windows multiple times
2020-07-15T19:00:07  <gtirloni> I'll submit a PR asap
2020-07-15T19:04:22  <gtirloni> running tests now -- https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1001
2020-07-15T20:13:49  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I merged your PR for the line endings
2020-07-15T20:36:57  <Bosmon> Thanks very much gtirloni - I merged it into my branch and the CI pass ran fine
