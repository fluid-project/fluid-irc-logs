2020-03-24T17:44:48  <colinclark> Y_OU_MN_aA_M_ALi: You were asking about whether or not you need to work on specific bugs
2020-03-24T17:44:58  <colinclark> And the answer to that question is also up to you
2020-03-24T17:45:22  <colinclark> A strong proposal will need to show evidence of knowledge of the code base you will be working in
2020-03-24T17:45:36  <colinclark> Fixing bugs is one way to gain that knowledge, but there may be other ways for you to do so
2020-03-24T17:46:25  <sgithens> cindyli: Wow, do we really cram the entire OS Device Json into the URL?  I wonder if we have a POST version of this as well?  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/FlowManager.md#get-lifecycle-instructions-from-cloud-based-flow-manager-get-gpiikeysettingsdevice
2020-03-24T17:46:49  <colinclark> Also note that a key criteria for students is that they have shown that they can do research independently and make appropriate decisions and technical recommendations
2020-03-24T17:47:02  <sachin10101998> hey colinclark, when will we get reviews on our draft proposal. I know there's already lots of work pending for you guys, but still could we get a tentative date as the number of days left to make whatever changes would be required after reviews is decreasing.
2020-03-24T17:47:25  <colinclark> Hi sachin10101998, I’m sorry, I don’t know the answer to that question
2020-03-24T17:47:57  <sachin10101998> It's fine. We'll wait

2020-03-24T18:03:44  <SemicolonExp> i also looked at some archived messages on the irc and found that there are "phases" could someone direct me to where those are posted?
2020-03-24T18:03:45  <SemicolonExp> thanks
2020-03-24T18:04:55  <Justin_o> batey96_: hello, is there something specific you'd like to talk about?
2020-03-24T18:05:58  <sachin10101998> SemicolonExp during the CB phase, communications are done regarding the projec with other community members and tech stack is finalized along with how things would be implemented.
2020-03-24T18:06:05  <sachin10101998> In general ^
2020-03-24T18:06:22  <SemicolonExp> Ah so that is the "choosing technologies" part
2020-03-24T18:06:30  <sachin10101998> Not exactly.

2020-03-24T18:09:42  <cindyli> sgithens: the universal only has this GET version right now. did you run into problem with it?
2020-03-24T18:10:50  <batey96_> yes Justin_o, as separation of concerns(placing content in a diff repo,the static generator in another repo and at build time,link the external repo)..
2020-03-24T18:11:18  <batey96_> is submoduling perfect for this??
2020-03-24T18:14:15  <Justin_o> batey96_: so you have understood the situation correctly. The specific method for achieving it is something you'll need to research and weigh the pro and cons with. Using a submodule is one option that could be investigated.
2020-03-24T18:15:32  <batey96_> okay Justin_o because there is a feasibiot
2020-03-24T18:15:48  <sgithens> cindyli: Not yet, but I'm going to make a script that puts in all the solutions from the solutions registry as a debug utility against the dev/prod clusters. I'm not sure if the 2k or 3k URL limit is really enforced, but it will be interesting to see
2020-03-24T18:15:51  <batey96_> feasibility of automating deploys with submidules
2020-03-24T18:16:44  <Justin_o> automating deploys is something we'd also want
2020-03-24T18:17:13  <batey96_> thanks Justin_o while waiting for reviews on my migration of fluid/floe to a modern static site gen..i will do more research on the other project
2020-03-24T18:17:37  <Justin_o> batey96_: sounds good
