2019-03-25T10:47:39  <jhernandez> stegru: morning!
2019-03-25T10:47:51  <stegru> hello
2019-03-25T10:57:02  <jhernandez> hey, did you see Gregg's report about "phantom usbs"?
2019-03-25T10:58:40  <stegru> ah yes
2019-03-25T10:59:57  <jhernandez> I wonder if this is something related to his vms
2019-03-25T11:00:16  <jhernandez> ?
2019-03-25T11:01:31  <stegru> well, by the looks of it, they could be SD card readers
2019-03-25T11:03:30  <jhernandez> hmm, yeah, or empty cd rom drives ?
2019-03-25T11:07:56  <stegru> yes similar to that, but no
2019-03-25T11:09:51  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/255
2019-03-25T11:10:01  <stegru> oh wait, I didn't update the tests
2019-03-25T11:11:58  <stegru> yes! got it in before gpii-bot noticed :)
2019-03-25T11:12:57  <stegru> this is the type of drive: "The drive has removable media; for example, a floppy drive, thumb drive, or flash card reader."

2019-03-25T12:28:10  <jhernandez> stegru: btw, I remember that you made some changes around the qss handleBlur thing in gpii-app when implementing the trayButton
2019-03-25T12:28:37  <stegru> I think so, jhernandez
2019-03-25T12:28:51  <jhernandez> did I ever tell you that the qss isn't hiding when you click outside of the qss?
2019-03-25T12:29:05  <jhernandez> I think I even reported a JIRA, let me check
2019-03-25T12:29:11  <stegru> yes, you did

2019-03-25T12:30:48  <jhernandez> here we go - right https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3665
2019-03-25T12:31:05  <jhernandez> ok, it's assigned to Dido
2019-03-25T12:31:21  <jhernandez> I'll let him know if he has time to look at this
2019-03-25T12:32:25  <jhernandez> it might be a stupid thing after changes that arrived after the trayButton got into trunk
2019-03-25T12:33:08  <stegru> I know there was a check to see if the mouse was inside the tray icon, and not to hide if it's there
2019-03-25T12:33:33  <stegru> but since the tray icon is no longer used, i'm not sure if that check is still performed
2019-03-25T12:34:17  <jhernandez> I've been debugging, and it reaches that area of code
2019-03-25T12:34:32  <jhernandez> but it returns "undefined"
2019-03-25T12:36:26  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/tray.js#L106 results in undefined
2019-03-25T12:36:29  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/dialogs/quickSetStrip/qssDialog.js#L314
2019-03-25T12:38:37  <stegru> it should be !tray.isMouseOver()
2019-03-25T12:39:17  <stegru> damn, it has my name on it
2019-03-25T12:42:56  <jhernandez> doh!
2019-03-25T12:47:11  <jhernandez> stegru: yes, it's that
2019-03-25T12:47:20  <jhernandez> do you want to provide a fix? or shall I?
2019-03-25T12:48:35  <stegru> it's inconvenient for me to do it immediately, I'll do it if you can wait
2019-03-25T12:48:44  <jhernandez> I was focused in the isMouseOverTray end - didn't realize the condition in the early place
2019-03-25T12:48:51  <jhernandez> stegru: I can do it right away
2019-03-25T12:49:08  <jhernandez> it's a tiny change
2019-03-25T12:50:36  <stegru> let me know if you need help with it ;)
2019-03-25T12:50:48  <jhernandez> sure, thanks

2019-03-25T14:06:59  <Bosmon> stegru, jhernandez - my feeling that what we've got is a race between the following two events in the app: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L349
2019-03-25T14:07:09  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L377
2019-03-25T14:07:29  <Bosmon> It is perfectly possible for the onSessionStart event to be fielded whilst most of the GPII app isn't constructed
2019-03-25T14:07:53  *** clown <clown!clown@nat/ocadu/x-odfawlbfwwbsgcaf> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-25T14:08:27  <Bosmon> So a first pass super-stupid hack fix would be to just add a promise in the app that is checked by the onSessionStart listener which is then tacked onto if it exists rather than DO IT NOW
2019-03-25T14:09:30  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@192-0-159-124.cpe.teksavvy.com> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-25T14:09:46  <Bosmon> But it would be useful to get some confirmation that this is the particular race we are interested in
2019-03-25T14:10:01  <Bosmon> Since the important race might well be a completely different one
2019-03-25T14:11:49  <Bosmon> It's not clear why we're facing any races wrt. "reset to standard", but it's not really clear that we are
2019-03-25T14:15:22  <Bosmon> jhernandez - is there a JIRA specifically for J1?
2019-03-25T14:15:41  <jhernandez> nope, since it was unclear what was happening
2019-03-25T14:16:10  <stegru> what does this have to do with "reset to standard"? is this another race?
2019-03-25T14:16:23  <jhernandez> I don't know either why we're having problems with reset to std now
2019-03-25T14:17:07  <kris_HA> Hey Bosmon, I checked the reset to standard issue and I see that the response from core is empty on reset.
2019-03-25T14:18:00  <Bosmon> Hi kris_HA, that's interesting
2019-03-25T14:18:04  <Bosmon> cindyli, is that as expected?
2019-03-25T14:18:14  <kris_HA> and when the response is empty are used the default settings gpiiConnector,js line 803
2019-03-25T14:18:21  <Bosmon> That would explain why Danail's fix is effective
2019-03-25T14:19:11  <Bosmon> OK, so we're just left with the login race
2019-03-25T14:19:17  <Bosmon> Which I see is https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3818
2019-03-25T14:19:47  <Bosmon> I'll make an "indicative pull" to sketch what I think might work here
2019-03-25T14:20:06  <Bosmon> It's a bit like an "indicative vote" about Brexit in that it doesn't necessarily mean anything :)
2019-03-25T14:20:21  <jhernandez> yes, that's what I reported as I got it, I thought it was just the save button
2019-03-25T14:21:06  <jhernandez> "indicative" is the right term here, yes

2019-03-25T14:27:58  <cindyli> kris_HA, Bosmon, it's expected that gpii-app receives an empty payload after a reset.

2019-03-25T14:55:57  <stegru> ok, Bosmon - that sort of fixes the login race. But, only when the "noUser" login is removed
2019-03-25T14:56:34  <stegru> which, I guess is ok - unless the noUser causes some special initialisation

2019-03-25T15:43:18  <Bosmon> Ok
2019-03-25T15:43:56  <Bosmon> So what we need to wait for is the latest of this event - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L215 , and the onPSPPrerequisitesReady event
2019-03-25T15:44:23  <Bosmon> This is probably the first moment the system is credibly ready for someone to key in

2019-03-25T16:18:23  <jhernandez> but now I can notice the following
2019-03-25T16:19:13  <jhernandez> when I start the windows session, the tray icon becomes green (that means that auto-key-in) and the icon tooltip says: Morphic: Ready, but a few seconds later, the tooltip says "Morphic: undefined"

2019-03-25T16:28:17  <jhernandez> then I can sign out/sign in
2019-03-25T16:29:06  <jhernandez> this way I see how auto-key-in behaves
2019-03-25T16:30:46  <jhernandez> because auto-key-in is (in general) working fine when starting the service manually and without any windows sign out/in process
2019-03-25T16:46:04  <Bosmon> jhernandez - what does it mean to have auto-key-in "without any windows sign out/in process"
2019-03-25T16:47:07  <jhernandez> when you start gpii-app, your user gets auto-keyed-in
2019-03-25T16:47:21  <Bosmon> And that works ok?
2019-03-25T16:47:49  <jhernandez> most of the times, yes
2019-03-25T16:47:53  <Bosmon> That's odd
2019-03-25T16:48:07  <jhernandez> but sometimes it happens the same as when you sign out/back into windows
2019-03-25T16:48:13  <jhernandez> yes
2019-03-25T16:48:17  <jhernandez> very
2019-03-25T16:48:19  <Bosmon> I guess it's just that the system is less congested without windows signon in process
2019-03-25T16:48:31  <jhernandez> I guess so
2019-03-25T16:48:32  <Bosmon> And so whatever race condition already exists is less mild
2019-03-25T16:48:38  <Bosmon> More mild
2019-03-25T16:48:40  * jhernandez nods
2019-03-25T16:49:06  <Bosmon> Has my "indicative fix" made it any visibly more reliable?
2019-03-25T16:49:13  <Bosmon> Or does it still just generally not work
2019-03-25T16:55:14  <stegru> it's made a theoretical improvement
2019-03-25T16:55:29  <stegru> but nothing practical, for me
2019-03-25T16:57:38  <Bosmon> As a wild hack, try a fluid.invokeLater() here...... https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/117/files#diff-bc658f47466ba31df21972f46d3f02d4R459

2019-03-25T20:27:26  <sgithens> When you build the gpii-app from scratch, where is it config'd or going by default to find it's flowmanager server?  It doesn't seem to have a GPII_CLOUD_URL env like the installed morphic version does?

2019-03-25T22:56:09  <sgithens> jhernandez stegru: What I mean is, what code actually reads the GPII_CLOUD_URL env variable to configure where to send the requests?  I don't see it anywhere in github:  https://github.com/search?p=1&q=GPII_CLOUD_URL&type=Code   All the results are either README's or scripts which start it up. But I don't see any other tangible scripts or js files that actually use teh variable?
2019-03-25T22:56:51  <sgithens> Maybe this work is still in a branch which is why it's not showing up in the global search... but I thought it was all merged in trunk.  I grepped my local repo's as well
2019-03-25T22:56:59  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.config.untrusted.base.json5#L15

2019-03-25T23:04:20  <bryan_> So we've got our answer about where the url is...what's the next step?
2019-03-25T23:05:22  <sgithens> bryan_: Figure out what the default or current value of that value is on your gpii-app vm instance
2019-03-25T23:06:46  <sgithens> I'm guessing it's going to be the value on line 11 of the file stegru posted
2019-03-25T23:07:45  <sgithens> and then see if you can just hit that with a browser, and then also see if you get the value of the cloudURL from the started instance in a debugger or log or something
2019-03-25T23:09:16  <bryan_> Ok let me try that
2019-03-25T23:10:00  <sgithens> then you could also just try using the gcp production account and see if it works when it's not pointing to your local machine, set GPII_CLOUD_URL=https://flowmanager.prd.gcp.gpii.net
2019-03-25T23:10:14  <sgithens> but we should be able to get it working self contained as well
2019-03-25T23:25:09  <bryan_> At what point should GPII_CLOUD_URL be defined?
2019-03-25T23:25:28  <bryan_> It seems to be undefined wherever I check for it
2019-03-25T23:25:34  <sgithens> just in your terminal before you call `npm run dev`
2019-03-25T23:25:43  <sgithens> as an environement variable
2019-03-25T23:25:58  <sgithens> I think the syntax above is for the cmd dos one.  The powershell syntax is a little different
2019-03-25T23:26:19  <sgithens> but it gets set to a different variable from the settings
2019-03-25T23:26:30  <jhernandez> sgithens: right, in powershell use $env:GPII_CLOUD_URL=""
2019-03-25T23:26:51  <jhernandez> you can also run everything locally
2019-03-25T23:27:44  <jhernandez> if you're using gpii-app/master, there's the dev config, which runs everything locally
2019-03-25T23:27:53  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/package.json#L40
2019-03-25T23:28:19  <jhernandez> which uses this universal config https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/configs/app.dev.json#L14
2019-03-25T23:31:40  <sgithens> reading the snippet from above with the distributeOptions ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/d9201cb05f9d93938b5d1c0b9a43c933b902b5c9/src/documents/IoCSS.md ), you can see that it uses that env variable to set the `cloudURL` variable on the settingsDataSource in the flowManager.  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/SettingsDataSource.js#L33
2019-03-25T23:31:40  <sgithens> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L40
2019-03-25T23:33:57  <jhernandez> sgithens: yup, and will be overwrite later if GPII_CLOUD_URL variable is set
2019-03-25T23:34:16  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.config.untrusted.base.json5#L14-L18
