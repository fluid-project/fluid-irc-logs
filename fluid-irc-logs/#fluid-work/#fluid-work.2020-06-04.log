2020-06-04T13:54:00  <Justin_o> cindyli1, greatislander: Lighthouse provides a Github Actions integrated CI task https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#prerequisites
2020-06-04T13:54:21  <Justin_o> sorry, better link https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
2020-06-04T13:55:32  <cindyli1> Justin_o: ya, it would be nice to have the Lighthouse test as a part of CI
2020-06-04T13:56:35  <Justin_o> cindyli1: I can file a ticket about that.. I might also have a bit of time to look at that if you like.
2020-06-04T13:57:03  <cindyli1> that would be great. thanks, Justin_o

2020-06-04T13:58:45  <Justin_o> cindyli: let me file a ticket for now
2020-06-04T13:58:51  <cindyli> thanks
2020-06-04T14:11:00  <Justin_o> cindyli: here's the ticket https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/267 I don't know what if any projects and milestones it should be added to
2020-06-04T14:13:30  <cindyli> Justin_o: i'm thinking to add it to 2.2 so it doesn't hold off the release of adding UIO
2020-06-04T14:13:56  <cindyli> if it gets done sooner, we move it to 2.1 ;)
2020-06-04T14:14:03  <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds reasonable
2020-06-04T14:56:06  <Justin_o> colinclark: could you please take a look at the first draft of the privacy policy https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Privacy+Policy
2020-06-04T14:56:28  <Justin_o> I think gtirloni will probably need to review and update the "Website Usage" section
2020-06-04T15:06:15  <colinclark> Justin_o: I made some edits, just to further simplify the prose
2020-06-04T15:14:42  <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks for the changes, looks good. I made a couple more minor word changes related to typos/word usage that came from my original draft.
2020-06-04T15:14:58  <colinclark> perfect thanks
2020-06-04T15:16:02  <Justin_o> colinclark: I'll send a note the fluid-work list about the privacy policy and ask those building sites to link to it.
2020-06-04T15:16:22  <colinclark> thank you
2020-06-04T15:16:47  <Justin_o> thanks for the help with it
2020-06-04T16:27:30  <Bosmon> Justin_o - is it a known issue that UIO+ tends to flicker a lot if you use the scrollbar with the mouse?
2020-06-04T16:40:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. don't think so
2020-06-04T16:40:03  <Justin_o> what do you mean by flicker?
2020-06-04T16:41:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: on macOS I don't see any flickering
2020-06-04T16:41:10  <Justin_o> but might not be sure what you mean exactly
2020-06-04T16:47:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I also tried with the gpii-app vagrant VM and didn't notice any flickering.. again I might be misinterpreting what you mean by flicker or how to reproduce the issue
2020-06-04T17:02:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - as you drag the scrollbar the pane occasionally judders back to the nearest panel and then judders back again
2020-06-04T17:02:53  <Bosmon> Will be very hard to produce a screenshot given it just happens for a couple of frames : P
2020-06-04T17:11:53  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah, maybe it depends on the speed with which you are scrolling. I believe the panels will attempt to snap to the correct position.
2020-06-04T17:12:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the general logic in the arrow scrolling could probably be improved or reconsidered..
2020-06-04T17:23:32  <gmoss> Bosmon: ping

2020-06-04T19:46:23  <Bosmon> Hi there gmoss
2020-06-04T19:46:37  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think they shouldn't try to snap until you release the mouse button
2020-06-04T19:48:34  <clown> Justin_o:  are you around tomorrow?
2020-06-04T19:49:11  <Justin_o> clown: I am not, I'll be away on Monday too
2020-06-04T19:50:21  <clown> Okay, I'm stuck on a problem, but I'd like your (quick) opinion on other transformations that I've yet to really study.  Do you have time now or sometime before your quit for the day?
2020-06-04T19:50:46  <Justin_o> I'm in a meeting for wecount right now. what time are you off today?
2020-06-04T19:51:05  <clown> 5:30pm
2020-06-04T19:51:53  * clown checks calendar and sees the wecount meeting ends at 4:30.
2020-06-04T19:52:32  <Justin_o> okay, I'll try to meet up with you after the wecount meeting
2020-06-04T19:52:38  <clown> thanks!
2020-06-04T19:52:41  <gmoss> Hi Bosmon, sorry I'm in the middle of an errand :) I was going to ask you if you had time to cut a new release of your 6145 branch that incorporates Justin_o's fix for FLUID-6512 (latest infusion master)
2020-06-04T19:53:00  <gmoss> I'll have to check your reply later on haha.. but if you're able to it would be very much appreciated
2020-06-04T19:54:46  <Bosmon> gmoss - sure - 3.0.0-dev.20200604T195400Z.dddc6a2.FLUID-6145
2020-06-04T20:25:18  <Justin_o> clown: okay, ready to meet
2020-06-04T20:25:41  <clown> Justin_o:  zoom?  standup room?
2020-06-04T20:25:44  <Justin_o> sure
