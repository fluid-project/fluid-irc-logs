2019-06-26T10:06:38  <jhernandez> Bosmon: morning
2019-06-26T10:06:43  <jhernandez> by when you're around
2019-06-26T10:07:38  <Bosmon> Hi there
2019-06-26T10:07:40  <Bosmon> VVERNNANVVEZZ
2019-06-26T10:08:27  <jhernandez> will we need this gpii-app pull (https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/115) after https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/764 gets in?
2019-06-26T10:09:08  <jhernandez> I'm not completely sure, just wanted to double check
2019-06-26T10:09:42  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, they are related
2019-06-26T10:09:51  <jhernandez> yeah, that's why I asked
2019-06-26T10:09:54  <Bosmon> But I suspect that 115 will actually get reworked and simplified after 764 gets in
2019-06-26T10:10:31  <jhernandez> ok, esa era mi SOSPECHA
2019-06-26T10:10:34  <jhernandez> :P
2019-06-26T10:11:53  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-06-26T10:12:25  <Bosmon> jhernandez - hopefully putting in 764 doesn't disturb anything
2019-06-26T10:12:35  <Bosmon> It just means that the reported schema defaults will be "more accurate"
2019-06-26T10:12:49  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~yanachkov@185.97.75.80> has joined #fluid-work
2019-06-26T10:12:50  <Bosmon> And it then means that the gpii-app code doesn't have to keep grubbing about loading the defaults file by itself
2019-06-26T10:13:07  <Bosmon> kris_HA can perhaps scroll back and confirm that he agrees with my description of the situation :)
2019-06-26T10:13:34  <jhernandez> yes, and probably we would like to test how gpii-app behaves after 764 gets in
2019-06-26T10:14:26  <jhernandez> and see if we still need to do something else around gpii-app

2019-06-26T10:34:46  <Bosmon> kris_HA, Danail_Dido - what do you think about this morning's discussion? http://irc-logs.fluidproject.org/%23fluid-work/%23fluid-work.2019-06-26.log
2019-06-26T10:35:17  <kris_HA> Hi, I'll check it now.
2019-06-26T10:37:16  <Danail_Dido> @Bosmon, sounds good, so I guess we will postpone the new reset logic until see what your changes will do, and decide what to do next.
2019-06-26T10:39:42  *** jhernandez <jhernandez!~jhernande@2a02:a03f:3e5a:900:d9e0:6594:11c4:1e82> has quit IRC (Quit: jhernandez)
2019-06-26T10:41:03  <kris_HA> Yup, sounds good to me too.
2019-06-26T10:48:19  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - so the new reset logic wasn't planned to get in for the upcoming release?
2019-06-26T10:48:28  <Bosmon> That is, the one in 2 days? : P
2019-06-26T11:02:56  <Danail_Dido> @Bosmon well, the current version (which loads the file from the location) its fully functional and was planned to get into the release.
2019-06-26T11:03:09  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - cool, ok
2019-06-26T11:03:10  <Danail_Dido> But after these changes, I don't know how it will be affected and I can't say.
2019-06-26T11:34:54  <stegru> Bosmon, funny how we both wrote up the multi-user thing on the same day
2019-06-26T11:39:26  <Bosmon> stegru - I guess not so funny given we were working up to the "JIRA purge festival" later on : P
2019-06-26T11:39:29  <Bosmon> stegru - what is your #?
2019-06-26T11:40:38  <stegru> GPII-3934, but that will cover all tasks related to the multisession work

2019-06-26T12:08:02  <stegru> jhernandez: como estas?
2019-06-26T12:08:25  <jhernandez> can't complain
2019-06-26T12:08:29  <jhernandez> :)
2019-06-26T12:08:30  <stegru> then don't
2019-06-26T12:09:05  <jhernandez> FYI, reviewing the WIP from HA this morning I realized that they'll be calling the app-specific office prefs
2019-06-26T12:09:32  <jhernandez> and I'd say that for it to work we need to provide a common term for that
2019-06-26T12:10:23  <jhernandez> this is because the PSP channel only deals with common/generic terms - Bosmon correct me if I'm wrong
2019-06-26T12:10:34  <stegru> what's wrong with  http://registry\.gpii\.net/applications/com\.microsoft\.office.word-ribbon ?
2019-06-26T12:11:24  <jhernandez> it's app-specific
2019-06-26T12:12:05  <jhernandez> it happened to us the same when adding the brightness thing and JJ added a common term for it to work

2019-06-26T12:12:29  <stegru> ok ok
2019-06-26T12:17:36  <Bosmon> jhernandez - still not totally clear
2019-06-26T12:17:41  <Bosmon> What's the form of the preference they want?

2019-06-26T12:19:17  <stegru> so, adding something to flat will make it work, jhernandez ?
2019-06-26T12:19:37  <stegru> flat.json5
2019-06-26T12:20:12  <stegru> (just looking for references to the brightness)
2019-06-26T12:20:37  <jhernandez> yup, that's what we did for the brightness to work
2019-06-26T12:21:59  <stegru> ok that's fine (not multa), but this setting IS application specific
2019-06-26T12:23:09  <jhernandez> Bosmon: didn't we figure out that dealing with mixed app-specific and generic terms was a bit awkward from the PSP channel perspective?
2019-06-26T12:23:25  <stegru>  /common/wordRibbon
2019-06-26T12:24:20  <Bosmon> jhernandez - shouldn't be any reason it shouldn't work
2019-06-26T12:25:15  <Bosmon> "wordRibbon" is a pretty strange kind of "common term" given it mentions an application in its name : P
2019-06-26T12:25:25  <stegru> well, that's my point :)
2019-06-26T12:26:18  <stegru>  /common/officeRibbon - generic to all office applications ;)
2019-06-26T12:26:25  <jhernandez> well, that's my feeling too, but can't remember the details why the app-specific terms weren't fine for the PSP channel
2019-06-26T12:27:45  <jhernandez> stegru: I almost buy your common term :P - but yeah, I'm with Bosmon
2019-06-26T12:27:50  <jhernandez> xD
2019-06-26T12:29:00  <jhernandez> but yeah, can't think a better common term for it
2019-06-26T12:29:14  * jhernandez shrugs
2019-06-26T12:29:19  <stegru> because it's an application specific setting
2019-06-26T12:29:26  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I think it's just that they were using them when they shouldn't, e.g. for highContast
2019-06-26T12:30:05  <jhernandez> hmm, no, it happened with brightness
2019-06-26T12:30:15  <jhernandez> (before JJ created the common term)
2019-06-26T12:31:10  <jhernandez> in any case, I can grab HA's code and check if it works with the app-specific
2019-06-26T12:32:18  <jhernandez> gotta walk the dogs and have lunch - will be back in an hour or so

2019-06-26T14:32:10  <cindyli> hi colinclark, i heard from michelled that you are giving a Morphic demo today and would like to demonstrate a different set of preferences than we demoed last time. are there any specific preferences you'd like to demo this time? if not, i can provision a usb with a different GPII key that has different set of preferences than the last time.
2019-06-26T14:32:31  <colinclark> hey cindyli, thanks so much
2019-06-26T14:32:59  <colinclark> I think mostly I’m looking for something that’s interactive—meaning the Minister can try it out himself with a few different preference sets
2019-06-26T14:33:15  <colinclark> and where the result is very noticeably different from the standard Windows
2019-06-26T14:33:27  <colinclark> perhaps a screen reader, etc.
2019-06-26T14:39:38  <cindyli> colinclark: I believe "read aloud" is the only audio preference that Morphic supports at the moment. it turns on "enable self voicing" in UIO+ within Chrome, but does not turn on windows screen reader. this is great to demo but may not be easy enough for the Minster to try out by herself
2019-06-26T14:40:59  <colinclark> why no screenreaders?
2019-06-26T14:41:02  <cindyli> "language" preference to switch between english and french is noticeable when windows explorer is opened
2019-06-26T14:41:05  <colinclark> where did they go? :)
2019-06-26T14:42:30  <cindyli> I believe that preference should still be available with USB key-in. It's just not on Morphic menu
2019-06-26T14:42:59  <cindyli> but i need to give a try to make sure
2019-06-26T14:43:43  <cindyli> colinclark: do you have the Windows Surface with you? the one that has Morhpic installed ?
2019-06-26T14:44:07  <cindyli> don't see it in the locker where it used to be
2019-06-26T14:44:08  <clown> colinclark, cindy;o:  there was a screen reader prefs set for "orca" when looked into the demo for the minister's visit.  But I doubt Morphic/linux works.  And you are likely using Windows for your demo.
2019-06-26T14:44:26  <michelled> cindyli: it's possible simon has it at ISTE
2019-06-26T14:44:31  * clown wha?  who is "cindy:o"?
2019-06-26T14:45:14  <clown> I think part of the problem is that JAWS isn't on the demo machine.
2019-06-26T14:46:33  <clown> There is a key that starts the magnifier — looks very different from standard Windows.  I'm not sure which magnifier it is.
2019-06-26T14:46:43  <avtar> michelled: i _think_ simon only took an ipad with him
2019-06-26T14:47:05  <cindyli> double check the locker
2019-06-26T14:47:30  <colinclark> cindyli: I don’t have the surface, no
2019-06-26T14:47:50  <avtar> cindyli, michelled: perhaps try the left corner of bert's lab as well?
2019-06-26T14:48:03  <cindyli> ok. thanks, avtar
2019-06-26T14:48:08  <avtar> i think i saw a surface charging cable there when we were doing the video
2019-06-26T14:49:06  <stegru> would you like me to quickly fix the proximity listener, colinclark?
2019-06-26T14:49:27  <cindyli> stegru: is the preference for enabling the windows built in screen reader still supported by GPII? seems we do support windows built in magnifier.
2019-06-26T14:50:26  <stegru> I think so cindyli - no reason why not
2019-06-26T14:50:52  <stegru> naomi is the test user, let me check
2019-06-26T14:52:13  <stegru> yes it *looks* like it works, but my vm has no audio
2019-06-26T14:52:34  <clown> good to know stegru
2019-06-26T14:52:40  <stegru> they should make a screen reader for people with no audio
2019-06-26T14:54:22  <clown> default volume == 0?
2019-06-26T14:55:36  <cindyli> haha
2019-06-26T14:56:18  <cindyli> avtar, colinclark, michelled, found Windows Surface with Bert's help. trying naomi now

2019-06-26T15:04:52  <colinclark> i have to go to Beverly school at noon with sepidehshahi and then i’ll be in the office to try things out
2019-06-26T15:05:21  <cindyli> colinclark: do you want me to be there?
2019-06-26T15:08:39  <colinclark> you know, that’s a pretty good idea :)
2019-06-26T15:08:40  <colinclark> if you don’t mind
2019-06-26T15:11:20  <colinclark> were you planning to be around until then, cindyli?
2019-06-26T15:11:22  <cindyli> ok. there are 2 usb keys at the moment. one is what we used last time: to start magnifier and set the high contrast to white on black. the other is "naomi" that starts the screen reader (windows narrator)

2019-06-26T15:41:42  <colinclark> some day, it’d be nice, but there are so many other priorities
2019-06-26T15:41:50  <colinclark> but I really appreciate the offer :)
2019-06-26T15:42:35  <stegru> that's ok

2019-06-26T16:21:41  <jhernandez> cindyli: I've been reading the log so, whenever there's a demo, please contact JJ and/or me
2019-06-26T16:22:20  <jhernandez> we "more or less" know what is working, what's not, etc
2019-06-26T16:22:23  <jhernandez> ;)
2019-06-26T16:23:09  <cindyli> sure. thanks for letting me know, jhernandez
2019-06-26T16:23:46  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: ^ there's a Morphic demo at IDRC this afternoon with the Minister
2019-06-26T16:24:56  <javjarfer[m]>  Hi cindyli ! Is anything specific that you will want to demo?
2019-06-26T16:26:52  <cindyli> i believe we'll demo Morphic QSS, key in with USBs. One preference we'll demo but not on the Morphic menu is: key in "naomi" to start windows built in screen reader
2019-06-26T16:28:14  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: great, which Morphic installer were you planning to use? or will you use the gpii-master?

2019-06-26T16:39:34  <Bosmon> Hey there alanharnum - WAHHARRNNUM!
2019-06-26T16:39:48  <Bosmon> Did you ever see this highly interesting talk by a chap from the depths of the NY public library system? https://www.crummy.com/writing/speaking/2015-RESTFest/

2019-06-26T17:15:36  <alanharnum> I love this: "For purposes of this talk you can think of NYPL as a small tech company which has some odd budgeting rules and which happens to be 120 years old."

2019-06-26T17:21:59  <alanharnum> this is quite cool - I've actually had to touch some OPDS things on the CISL project due to the work with Readium (which some NYPL devs have also had a hand in in the past)
