2019-12-20T19:34:05  <gmoss> cindyli: there are still four or five review comments left by you and Bosmon on the PR, but two of them in particular stand out to me as good candidates for deferral to fresh Jiras:
2019-12-20T19:34:05  <gmoss> https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#pullrequestreview-270700397
2019-12-20T19:34:05  <gmoss> https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#pullrequestreview-270701074
2019-12-20T19:34:05  <gmoss> I plan to tackle the other as-yet-unaddressed comments today

2019-12-20T20:14:09  <cindyli> thanks for letting me know, gmoss. go ahead to create new jiras
2019-12-20T20:15:52  <gmoss> cindyli: okay :) I've been trying to address your feedback from here: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#pullrequestreview-332103970
2019-12-20T20:16:30  <gmoss>  but I'm having issues targeting the tableOfContents component from that point, my IoCSS isn't sharp enough, apparently
2019-12-20T20:19:17  <gmoss> I can target the UIO component ("{fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor}"), but even though "enhancer" is a subcomponent of it and exists at that very moment, "{fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor enhancer}" doesn't work
2019-12-20T20:19:41  <gmoss> same with using the > between the two

2019-12-20T20:25:56  <cindyli> gmoss: does what you have now at line 36 not work - https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35/files#diff-8d2014003434d9502a4871590ada6c4eR40
2019-12-20T20:26:33  <cindyli> oh, line 40
2019-12-20T20:27:27  <gmoss> cindyli: it does, but considering your review I thought I would make an effort to move it into the listener on the messageLoader onResourcesLoaded event
2019-12-20T20:29:00  <gmoss> cindyli: oh, do you mean to ask whether that IoC reference works within the listeners for {messageLoader}.events.onResourcesLoaded? if so, no it doesn't resolve
2019-12-20T20:33:04  <cindyli> gmoss: actually you can ignore this review comment because "onCreateTOCReady" is an aggregate event including "onMessagesLoaded" - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L482-L487
2019-12-20T20:34:20  <gmoss> cindyli: ah, that would make my job easier then :)
2019-12-20T20:34:43  <gmoss> I'll leave that code as it was
2019-12-20T20:35:20  <cindyli> sure. sorry, i will add another comment for why it can be ignored.
2019-12-20T20:35:41  <gmoss> cindyli: no worries. Thank you!
2019-12-20T20:35:59  <gmoss> I'll attempt to solve the last one before filing those Jiras
2019-12-20T20:36:15  <gmoss> which would be this: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#pullrequestreview-334102139
