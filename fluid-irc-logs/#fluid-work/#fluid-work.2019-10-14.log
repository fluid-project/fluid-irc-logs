2019-10-14T10:03:51  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon ! Good morning
2019-10-14T10:04:06  <Bosmon> Morning javjarfer[m]!
2019-10-14T10:05:20  <javjarfer[m]> Hi! I was writing the transform I need for R&W, and I found some lines inside infusion transforms I don't understand
2019-10-14T10:05:34  <javjarfer[m]> for instance, why is this check needed? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/132aa848c1c55f88dac7e8ebd996c67bca8d482e/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L364
2019-10-14T10:06:04  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I have to say that is some pretty terrible code
2019-10-14T10:06:17  <Bosmon> Unfortunately KASPARDNIETT is no longer around for us to curse him for it directly
2019-10-14T10:06:28  <Bosmon> But I will be sure to damn him on the next occasion that we meet
2019-10-14T10:07:05  <Bosmon> There's absolutely no way a transformer should be writing back to its transformSpec
2019-10-14T10:08:02  <Bosmon> All this seems to be trying to do is defaulting the values as required by this example: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#example-2-not-defining-presentvalue-and-missingvalue
2019-10-14T10:08:07  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: hahaha okay, that makes much more sense
2019-10-14T10:09:18  <javjarfer[m]> also, is there any place in which the nature of the "transformer" parameter is documented?
2019-10-14T10:09:50  <javjarfer[m]> I haven't been able to completely guess its responsibilities
2019-10-14T10:12:50  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - sadly KASPARDNIETT conked out before he could produce any docs on how to actually write transforms ....
2019-10-14T10:13:53  <Bosmon> You will have to form your guesses from the uses you see in the existing transforms : P
2019-10-14T10:14:12  <Bosmon> But most of what it is good for is keeping track of the current input and output prefixes, and being asked to expand things
2019-10-14T10:14:59  <Bosmon> In extremely special cases as a last resort I guess you can use it to bash on the output document directly : P https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/132aa848c1c55f88dac7e8ebd996c67bca8d482e/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L114
2019-10-14T10:16:46  <Bosmon> Here are where a lot of its user-useful functions are constructed: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/132aa848c1c55f88dac7e8ebd996c67bca8d482e/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L480
2019-10-14T10:17:31  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I see! So its responsibilities are dynamic depending on the use case

2019-10-14T15:05:02  <javjarfer[m]> I'm having this message right now regarding the transform "Transformation record is missing a type name: undefined"
2019-10-14T15:05:09  <javjarfer[m]> Do you know to what is this referring?
