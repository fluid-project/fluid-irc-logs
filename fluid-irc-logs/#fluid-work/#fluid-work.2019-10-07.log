2019-10-07T14:47:37  <cindyli> sgithens: are you able to read these settings using the capture tool:
2019-10-07T14:47:50  <cindyli> 1. the language settings on Windows
2019-10-07T14:48:00  <cindyli> 2. the high contrast theme on Windows
2019-10-07T14:48:26  <cindyli> 3. Microsoft Office "word-ribbon" setting
2019-10-07T14:49:00  <cindyli> 4. Chrome UIO+ "selfVoicingEnabled" setting
2019-10-07T14:51:32  <cindyli> The function I use to read is pretty much a copy of your capture tool function - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3958/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L1369-L1400
2019-10-07T14:51:53  <cindyli> For the first 3, I receive nothing
2019-10-07T14:52:29  <cindyli> For the last "selfVoicingEnabled", I receive {"selfVoicingEnabled": undefined}
2019-10-07T14:53:29  <cindyli> before I dig further into the read function, wonder if you've gone thru same issues and already have some insights?

2019-10-07T15:49:17  <Justin_o> Standup update: was off on Friday. On Thursday afternoon and this morning was taking care of some websavvy tasks. Helping and prepping for backing up Lisa. Also continuing work on FLUID-6278. I found a couple issues with MS Edge. I fixed one this morning and am looking into the other issue now. When that wraps up I'll do some more testing and file a PR.

2019-10-07T16:09:33  <sgithens> cindyli: I will check in just a sec when I get the capture env set back up
2019-10-07T16:10:01  <cindyli> thanks, sgithens
2019-10-07T16:10:36  <cindyli> sgithens: for 1, I found the language setting value does get returned from the read function. Since changing a language for "com.microsoft.windows.language" requires 3 setting handlers, there are 3 settings read and returned from each setting handler, seems we need a way to define which setting handler's get() returns the value we care. let me know if you already have a work around for it
2019-10-07T16:12:24  <cindyli> fyi, the return of the read function for "com.microsoft.windows.language": https://pastebin.com/jKDfL3xR. what we care is the value at line 15
