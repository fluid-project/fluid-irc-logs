2020-05-13T14:00:55  <cindyli> Justin_o: i'm going to host my own FLUID-6145 branch and publish a dev release to npmjs.com. can you help me to check if my publish steps are correct:
2020-05-13T14:00:57  <cindyli> npm run prepublishOnly
2020-05-13T14:01:20  <cindyli> npm install fluid-publish --save-dev
2020-05-13T14:01:20  <cindyli> ./node_modules/.bin/fluid-publish
2020-05-13T14:02:34  <cindyli> that's all. is it correct? thanks
2020-05-13T14:03:16  <Justin_o> cindyli: you can install fluid-publish globally if you want.. or maybe try using npx
2020-05-13T14:03:36  <cindyli> ok
2020-05-13T14:03:38  <Justin_o> you don't need to run prepublishOnly yourself that will run as part of publishing to npm
2020-05-13T14:03:46  <cindyli> good to know
2020-05-13T14:04:12  <cindyli> Justin_o: so it will look like:
2020-05-13T14:04:14  <cindyli> npm install fluid-publish -g
2020-05-13T14:04:18  <cindyli> fluid-publish
2020-05-13T14:04:32  <Justin_o> yes, calling fluid-publish from the root of the infusion directory
2020-05-13T14:04:51  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2020-05-13T14:05:09  <Justin_o> you should probably run npm install there first to make sure you have all the dependencies for that branch version
2020-05-13T14:06:53  <cindyli> i did
2020-05-13T14:07:13  <sachin10101998> A quick but probably silly question. Justin_o which repo do you guys refer to when you talk about fluid in general.
2020-05-13T14:07:25  <sachin10101998> For example Fluid-6145 branch
2020-05-13T14:07:50  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, well that should be it then. you  can run "fluid-publish --test" first if you want to test things out, this will create a package instead. so you should delete that first before running the publish for real
2020-05-13T14:08:32  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: often it's related to https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion
2020-05-13T14:08:49  <Justin_o> FLUID-6145 is a JIRA issue number https://issues.fluidproject.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa
2020-05-13T14:09:19  <sachin10101998> Ohh alright. I thought cindyli was referring to some branch in infusion which I couldn't find. Hence, the question. Thanks for info.
2020-05-13T14:09:27  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. you've published it ;)
2020-05-13T14:09:31  <Justin_o> there are some other repos that make use of the same JIRA space and also fall under the FLUID- JIRA namespace though.. so it's best to check what the JIRA number refers to if you are confused
2020-05-13T14:09:52  <sachin10101998> got it Justin_o
2020-05-13T14:10:04  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: yes, she is referring a branch, there is a PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/972
2020-05-13T14:10:34  <Justin_o> typically we don't keep these working branches in the projects repository, rather they are on the forks of those working on the issues and PR is submitted to the project repo from there
2020-05-13T14:11:05  <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, I've accidentally published the package a few times ;(
2020-05-13T14:11:07  <sachin10101998> yeah. Found it now. Thanks
2020-05-13T14:11:12  <Justin_o> np
2020-05-13T14:11:54  <cindyli> sorry, Justin_o, a typo in my sentence, it was "I" rather than "you": I've just published it
2020-05-13T14:12:07  <Justin_o> cindyli: oh :) congrats
2020-05-13T14:12:11  <cindyli> but it's a good idea to test with a local package rather than publishing to npmjs.com
2020-05-13T14:12:28  <cindyli> i will suggest to Ted
2020-05-13T14:12:50  <Justin_o> cindyli: I mostly use the local package to make sure the name and other things are correct, but you could also use that package for testing the actual code it's up to you
2020-05-13T14:13:15  <cindyli> ok
2020-05-13T14:13:21  <Justin_o> cindyli: also for Ted he wouldn't be able to publish to NPM but he could use that test package I guess if he wanted to create his own
2020-05-13T14:14:02  <cindyli> ya, he doesn't have the publish access
2020-05-13T14:14:14  <Justin_o> cindyli: that's a handy idea though, now that I think about it, because npm link doesn't work with our dedupe-infusion so one could use that trick instead I guess
2020-05-13T14:16:26  <cindyli> Justin_o: what does it mean "npm link doesn't work with our dedupe-infusion"? i know dedupe-infusion is to take multiple versions of infusion from various dependencies down to one. but how it relates to npm links
2020-05-13T14:18:08  *** yzen <yzen!~yzen@2607:f2c0:e352:6b:fc67:b0ee:dfc0:af8> has joined #fluid-work
2020-05-13T14:19:08  <Justin_o> cindyli: you can use npm link to create a symbolic link to a local copy of a dependency.. so for example if you are working on project B that requires project A and you need to make changes in project A to support the work in Project B. You use npm link to use your local copy of project A without having to change anything in your package.json folder
2020-05-13T14:20:02  <Justin_o> however it doesn't seem that dedupe-infusion will navigate through the symlinks, which sort of makes sense.
2020-05-13T14:22:04  <cindyli> ah ha. good to know, using "npm link" is great for pointing to infusion dir from WeCount dir
2020-05-13T14:25:08  <Justin_o> https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html:
2020-05-13T14:25:56  <Justin_o> cindyli: it's not hard to use, but I find it a bit confusing at first.. also if you run npm install after setting up the link, it will point the repo using it back to the one from npm
2020-05-13T14:26:24  <cindyli> ok

2020-05-13T16:22:11  <Bosmon> So jhernandez - re slimming down the gpii-app installer - there are  whole heap of dependencies that we only bring in because they are dependencies of the CBFM - eg. oauth2orize, passport, and all the tree below them, etc.
2020-05-13T16:22:21  <Bosmon> We could get together and try to make a BIG MAP OF UNNECESSARY MODULES
2020-05-13T16:22:39  <Bosmon> Also there are all the dev dependencies like grunt etc.

2020-05-13T19:30:59  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf jhernandez stegru Bosmon : Ok, there is an SPI setting that doesn't have a capabilities transform, which it has to have since that is where the SPI path comes from (until the SPI settings refactoring to schemas ever gets in).  It either needs to be removed or have the path added for it. I don't know what the path is, but I could remove it in a PR really quick, or add the path if someone knows what it
2020-05-13T19:31:00  <sgithens> is.
2020-05-13T19:31:03  <sgithens> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L7825-L7840
2020-05-13T19:31:26  <sgithens> After commenting out just that highlighted block, the snapshotter and capture tool work fine.
2020-05-13T19:35:13  <sgithens> Bosmon: Also, if you felt comfortable merging in GPII-1908, there's no reason we have to wait for the metrics stuff to get merged in, since the entire app doesn't work anyways. It's not going to break anything, and will start working as soon as this Acceleration item above is fixed in teh SR data

2020-05-13T20:22:05  <Bosmon> sgithens - we can't really merge stuff in that we can't verify because the entire app is broken : P
2020-05-13T20:22:18  <Bosmon> The only things we can merge in when the app is broken is stuff that we have a credible belief will stop it being broken : P
