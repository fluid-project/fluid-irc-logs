2020-03-13T14:25:13  <trhiana> colinclark: Hello Colin. I am Rhiana Latifah Nakalemba. I am a Ugandan and a second year Computer Science student at Ashesi University in Ghana. I am interested participating in GSoC 2020 and I want to cotribute to the Migrate the FLOE Project and Fluid Project websites to use a modern static site generator project. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, NodeJS and ReactJS. However, I am new to open
2020-03-13T14:25:13  <trhiana> source. Could you please guide me on how I should get started?
2020-03-13T14:25:38  <colinclark> Hi trhiana, nice to meet you.
2020-03-13T14:25:55  <colinclark> Have you had a look at our wiki page with a list of starting points and things to look into?
2020-03-13T14:26:15  <colinclark> This page has lots of information: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-03-13T14:27:01  <colinclark> From there, you may want to spend some time familiarizing yourself with how the sites are currently designed and built, and start putting together a plan for how you’d implement the project
2020-03-13T14:30:56  <trhiana> colinclark: So I don't have to start working on the project immediately? I have looked at the wiki page and I am currently looking through the github repositories
2020-03-13T14:37:08  <colinclark> trhiana: Yes, the next step in the process is to familiarize yourself and to create a proposal outlining how and when you’ll accomplish the project.
2020-03-13T14:37:26  <colinclark> This is something that jhung_2 and gmoss and I can share feedback on when you’ve started to think through your plan

2020-03-13T14:43:30  <colinclark> I think most of the mentors for the project you’re interested in are typically here in the IRC channel during Eastern time business hours

2020-03-13T16:41:04  <kasparnet> hey stegru As i mentioned on wednesday, Bosmon talked about one of the issues that is blocking the master branches from passing CI
2020-03-13T16:41:22  <stegru> yes, kasparnet
2020-03-13T16:41:23  <kasparnet> one releated to the gpii-app and windows repos
2020-03-13T16:41:36  <kasparnet> would you happen to have a pull request or a JIRA for that?
2020-03-13T16:41:53  <kasparnet> or do you have no idea what the hell i'm on about?
2020-03-13T16:41:55  <kasparnet> :)
2020-03-13T16:41:56  <stegru> well, I still don't know what the issue was

2020-03-13T17:34:41  <Bosmon> stegru, kasparnet3 - actually he does know what the issue was/is, and he issued a pull about it
2020-03-13T17:34:58  <Bosmon> BUt I was too afraid to merge it unless it disturbed something else, e.g. the stuff that Atkins was working on
2020-03-13T17:35:09  <kasparnet3> ok
2020-03-13T17:35:12  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@205.211.168.101> has joined #fluid-work
2020-03-13T17:35:15  <Bosmon> But given it looks like that is going to be of even greater scope than we fearued, I should try to merge it and get stuff unblocked
2020-03-13T17:35:25  <Bosmon> And work on the assumption that we are going to go backwards with universal rather than forwards
2020-03-13T17:35:26  <kasparnet3> do you have a link somewhere
2020-03-13T17:35:38  <kasparnet3> what is the increased scope?
2020-03-13T17:35:44  <kasparnet3> and how go backwards?
2020-03-13T17:35:48  <Bosmon> kasparnet3 - this one: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/298]
2020-03-13T17:35:50  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/298
2020-03-13T17:36:01  <stegru> oh yes, that
2020-03-13T17:36:06  <Bosmon> You can see that it is rather unique in that CI actually passed it on Windows
2020-03-13T17:36:13  <Bosmon> And my belief is that if we combined this with this pull request:
2020-03-13T17:36:32  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/184
2020-03-13T17:36:40  <Bosmon> We would succeed in unsticking the windows/app blockage

2020-03-13T17:39:00  <kasparnet3> Do you have a sense of how much it (or if it) will interfere with Hatkins' work?
2020-03-13T17:39:09  <Bosmon> kasparnet3 - I think it will be totally independent to Hatkins work
2020-03-13T17:39:21  <kasparnet3> that's great
2020-03-13T17:39:25  <Bosmon> BUt I always expected that Hatkins work would go forward rather than backwards and so I was afraid of disturbing it
2020-03-13T17:39:44  <Bosmon> But I think we decided last night that the problem with our solutions registry schemas is that they are simply wrong
2020-03-13T17:39:50  <Bosmon> And that it is the actual values that are right
2020-03-13T17:40:05  <Bosmon> But unfortunately all his work to date has been expecting that the schemas are right and the values are wrong
2020-03-13T17:40:31  <kasparnet3> "Hatkins work would go forward rather than backwards" ... sounds like something that would be said at the mad hatters tea party
2020-03-13T17:40:41  <sgithens> stegru Is your gpiikey-mover actually in github somewhere already, or just on your hardrive somewhere?
2020-03-13T17:40:47  <kasparnet3> oh shit, I'm sorry to hear that
2020-03-13T17:41:10  <stegru> sgithens - hard drive
2020-03-13T17:42:01  <Bosmon> So I think his/our current plan is to do a diff based on the "last known good" version of universal referenced from gpii-windows package.json and then try to reconstruct the best SR we can out of that so that we can do some kind of update to gpii-universal to get it unstuck
2020-03-13T17:44:19  <sgithens> do you have a better name than `gpiiKey-mover`? Otherwise I'll just use that to create the stub folder for you to add it. gpiiKey-relocater?
2020-03-13T17:46:09  <kasparnet3> I see
2020-03-13T17:46:42  <stegru> sgithens, call it whatever you wish - and here it is: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1DOWzzWfAvw4USRYkF9DwPLgVRAsLUSHL
2020-03-13T17:47:19  <kasparnet3> Should we wait until Hatkins get back tuesday, and set up a call between whoever is needed to talk through what's involved? Or is this something that you'd "just" do?
2020-03-13T17:47:23  <sgithens> stegru ,thanks.  userkey-transfer sounds way better
2020-03-13T17:47:39  <Bosmon> kasparnet3 - I will make an attempt at the windows/app unblock byself
2020-03-13T17:47:40  <Bosmon> myself
2020-03-13T17:47:45  <Bosmon> The universal/windows unblock needs lots of us
2020-03-13T17:47:56  <kasparnet3> ok
2020-03-13T17:50:22  <kasparnet3> so this would be something along the lines of you, me, Hatkins, stegru, sgithens, cindy?
2020-03-13T17:50:34  <kasparnet3> anyone else?
2020-03-13T17:50:45  <Bosmon> We can probably spare cindyli1 since she will be below 1 day/week for the rest of the month
2020-03-13T17:50:50  <Bosmon> Btw when are you out yourself?
2020-03-13T17:50:54  <Bosmon> I assume not starting on Monday
2020-03-13T17:51:15  <kasparnet3> well, I'll be working till Maja spits out the monster
2020-03-13T17:51:35  <kasparnet3> her due date is Tuesday
2020-03-13T17:51:37  <kasparnet3> but who knows
2020-03-13T17:52:01  <kasparnet3> it's getting close enough that I think it's hear saying it has started every time my phone ring :)

2020-03-13T17:53:32  <kasparnet3> yeah, totally
2020-03-13T17:53:35  <sgithens> nice
2020-03-13T17:53:41  <sgithens> with a birthing tank/tub?
2020-03-13T17:53:45  <kasparnet3> we have a bathtub in the living room and everyhing
2020-03-13T17:53:48  <kasparnet3> yeah, exactly
2020-03-13T17:53:48  <sgithens> YES
2020-03-13T17:53:51  <kasparnet3> haha
2020-03-13T17:53:52  <sgithens> so awesome
2020-03-13T17:53:59  <kasparnet3> ... flowers and candles all over, etc
2020-03-13T17:54:00  <sgithens> and a DOUOLA
2020-03-13T17:54:43  <kasparnet3> haha, not a douola though... I guess Majas mom could be considered such, as she'll be present and is a nurse at the maternity ward
2020-03-13T17:55:20  <kasparnet3> but I'm pretty happy that we've chosen a granola commune home birth, in these crazy corona times

2020-03-13T23:15:14  <Shyamal> Hello everyone! I was working on my draft proposal. So I was wondering whether I shall put my other open source contributions apart from this organisation to the proposal? Does Fluid consider other open source contributions as well?
2020-03-13T23:17:59  <gmoss> Hi Shyamal, great question. I think your proposal should focus on the work you plan to do for the project, but if you think your previous contributions are relevant then please feel free to include it. We can provide more formal feedback once you've submitted it via the GSoC website. Generally speaking, however, I don't imagine it would affect your chances as much as something like your understanding of the project
2020-03-13T23:19:09  <Shyamal> Thanks for the response @gmoss! I'll note it.
