2019-02-19T08:59:49  <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf ! I was again working in the ZoomText pull, I remember we delayed several flags settings implementation because we didn't have a way to represent them yet. Should I continue without adding proper schema or transforms to that settings?
2019-02-19T09:03:00  <javjarfer[m]> I thought  of the two possible approach being, represent the flag as an array of settings or use transforms to map the unique flag setting into multiple settings
2019-02-19T09:19:44  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I think we probably need a transform
2019-02-19T10:00:03  <stegru> jhernandez - the secret installer works really well
2019-02-19T10:01:50  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, I think so, so, one possible approach could be, create settings that will receive individual values of that flags, and then having a transform that folds all that individual settings values into the real setting
2019-02-19T10:02:48  <javjarfer[m]> that will be easy to map for anyone using the settings, because he would use the settings as any other normal ones, and leave us room to hide the real flag setting, with the attribute the-t-in-rtf and I were talking about yesterday
2019-02-19T10:03:11  <javjarfer[m]> will follow with that and paste you a link of the result in the pull

2019-02-19T10:29:13  <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, JJ, had my nose to a different grindstone and just saw your message.
2019-02-19T10:29:29  <javjarfer[m]> Unique issue with this approach is that, I can't be explicit in the schema definition of the real setting holding the flag values, at least in a JSON compatible way, because I will need to list all the possible outcomes
2019-02-19T10:30:09  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, this is something we have discussed, representing the settings in a way that is more JSON-friendly and then transforming to how the application actually stores it
2019-02-19T10:30:09  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: np, discussion still going, haven't done anything yet
2019-02-19T10:30:16  <javjarfer[m]> was reading this https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/518
2019-02-19T10:30:27  <the-t-in-rtf> ooo
2019-02-19T10:30:30  <the-t-in-rtf> neat!
2019-02-19T10:31:43  <the-t-in-rtf> It's definitely interesting, but I wouldn't hold your breath, draft 8 is a long way out as far as I know
2019-02-19T10:32:40  <the-t-in-rtf> and they're only talking about tackling that afterwards
2019-02-19T10:33:29  <the-t-in-rtf> we will definitely need some way to represent bitwise values in a range of places
2019-02-19T10:33:36  <the-t-in-rtf> JAWS is also lousy (in all senses) with those
2019-02-19T10:34:10  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe we can schedule an overlap meeting with Steve Githens, @Bosmon and myself in the next week or so?
2019-02-19T10:34:23  <javjarfer[m]> yes... it looks like there is no "standard" accepted answer, so we will need to figure it out one while they still deciding what to do
2019-02-19T10:34:24  <the-t-in-rtf> to talk it through, make more notes, and discuss what to do when
2019-02-19T10:34:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I think a super long enum is a good approach for now
2019-02-19T10:34:47  <javjarfer[m]> yes, that would be great
2019-02-19T10:34:48  <the-t-in-rtf> orr
2019-02-19T10:34:59  <the-t-in-rtf> what I've done, which is to only support a subset of what's possible
2019-02-19T10:35:11  <the-t-in-rtf> like "all on" or "all off" for those settings
2019-02-19T10:35:21  <the-t-in-rtf> or just to say that we can't support those settings now
2019-02-19T10:35:48  <javjarfer[m]> yes, that is one possibility but with a long "enum" comes a long "enumLabels" and I don't know how to specify the labels of that enum
2019-02-19T10:35:49  <the-t-in-rtf> so, what's the bitmasked setting you're trying to onboard?
2019-02-19T10:35:51  <Bosmon> Well, it's faulty that the place we write the schema is at the settings handler's end
2019-02-19T10:36:13  <Bosmon> We had a long-standing work item to reform the SR so that we schematised all settings in the way we currently do for "common term"
2019-02-19T10:36:15  <Bosmon> terms
2019-02-19T10:36:26  <javjarfer[m]> and array of the settings that are triggered? and string with the names of the settings that are triggered split with a delimiter?
2019-02-19T10:36:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess my question is, what's the setting and can we live without it for now?
2019-02-19T10:36:52  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "Well, it's faulty that the place"> yes, this is a good issue to talk about
2019-02-19T10:37:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I  mean, I just flat out told Gregg that we couldn't support the JAWS bitmasked settings without more engineering effort
2019-02-19T10:37:15  <the-t-in-rtf> and he accepted that
2019-02-19T10:37:25  <the-t-in-rtf> we will definitely need to address the larger issue eventually
2019-02-19T10:37:40  <the-t-in-rtf> the question is always whether this has to be addressed right now
2019-02-19T10:38:01  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, do you know of any showstoppers that require us to tackle this now?
2019-02-19T10:38:28  <javjarfer[m]> Right now, the settings from ZoomText that require this, are part of the Navigation settings
2019-02-19T10:38:31  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - no, none
2019-02-19T10:38:43  <Bosmon> We can certainly just leave on the floor any settings we can't ontologise well
2019-02-19T10:38:46  <javjarfer[m]> Tracking and Alignment, with I think are pretty common for AT
2019-02-19T10:38:52  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that has  been my strategy
2019-02-19T10:38:53  <Bosmon> It's not like these are being rolled out to any pilots imminently
2019-02-19T10:40:14  <javjarfer[m]> Okay, then I will do that, for any flag related setting I will write it informally in the PR
2019-02-19T10:40:26  <javjarfer[m]> do we have an issue for this? I could write one and link the PR with it
2019-02-19T10:58:30  <jhernandez> sgithens: I assume you already figured it out, if not - 1) Yes, GPII_CLOUD_URL is the only thing you need to change 2) AppData/Roaming/gpii/
2019-02-19T10:58:42  <jhernandez> stegru: morning
2019-02-19T10:58:59  <stegru> hi
2019-02-19T10:59:19  <jhernandez> does your windoes service like that file? is it fine with those permissions?
2019-02-19T11:00:27  <stegru> yes - I haven't tested it with the service, but it runs as "root" so I'd imagine it would work
2019-02-19T11:00:47  <jhernandez> if so, I'll add a minimal UI and create a repo with that
2019-02-19T11:01:43  <stegru> ok.. I can read it from an admin command line
2019-02-19T11:02:18  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I've written up https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3734
2019-02-19T11:15:03  <jhernandez> stegru: okay, just wanted to double check, because with my vagrant user (who is in the admin group) can't read the file
2019-02-19T11:16:53  <stegru> jhernandez, I think that's the same is being in the sudoers group - if you start an admin command line (or run notepad as administrator), you should be able to read it
2019-02-19T11:36:36  <jhernandez> yeah, that was my guess but ... you know, it's windows :P
2019-02-19T11:36:41  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-02-19T11:37:44  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: thanks for the writing, I will link that issue
2019-02-19T11:38:23  <jhernandez> btw, stegru, can you give https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/244 a quick laser eye review? I can merge if you are happy with it
2019-02-19T11:45:34  <stegru> looks ok jhernandez
2019-02-19T11:50:02  <jhernandez> great, thanks!!!
2019-02-19T12:03:38  <jhernandez> stegru: Bosmon here's the SICRET BLOWA https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-credentials-installer
2019-02-19T12:03:50  <Bosmon> Crikey!
2019-02-19T12:04:12  <Bosmon> Interesting
2019-02-19T12:04:16  <Bosmon> So you built it right into the .msi
2019-02-19T12:04:31  <jhernandez> let me know if that fits our expectations or needs more love
2019-02-19T12:04:48  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yup, that was the plan, right?
2019-02-19T12:05:14  <stegru> copies a file, sets the permissions.. I don't believe anything else is needed
2019-02-19T12:05:28  <Bosmon> jhernandez - right, but I guess .msi is powerful enough to do everything in itself without even needing a separate script
2019-02-19T12:05:32  <Bosmon> Yup, this looks absolutely great
2019-02-19T12:05:41  <Bosmon> Very good job
2019-02-19T12:09:29  <jhernandez> yeah, I'm setting the permissions here https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-credentials-installer/blob/master/MorphicCredentials.wxs#L72-L73
2019-02-19T12:10:24  <stegru> jhernandez, the permission might be able to be tightened further to just allow local services - I'll confirm that later. for now, this is good enough
2019-02-19T12:10:38  <jhernandez> I wasn't confident enough since there are people setting permissions with custom scripts, but I guess it's for very particular use cases
2019-02-19T12:10:53  <jhernandez> stegru: yes, I thought about that
2019-02-19T12:11:30  <jhernandez> let me know after you figure it out

2019-02-19T14:15:58  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - thanks for the super-quick and great implementation for GPII-3726
2019-02-19T14:16:01  <Bosmon> What are you looking at now?
2019-02-19T14:16:55  <cindyli> will start on GPII-3721 soon, now looking at tyler's comments on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3729 and thinking what suggestions i should give, Bosmon
2019-02-19T14:19:35  <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess we need to try this out locally and produce a few heap snapshots
2019-02-19T14:20:44  <Bosmon> It is relatively easy in the Chrome inspector these days, which I tried when I was investigating https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3630
2019-02-19T14:21:31  <Bosmon> It's peculiar that there seems to be some kind of memory leak when not serving requests, the only route I can think for that is the contextManager's action every 20 seconds, and that doesn't even create any Infusion components ....
2019-02-19T14:23:29  <Bosmon> It's unclear that this is really a "leak" though since this may well be memory that will be reclaimed when there is a GC run
2019-02-19T14:24:40  <cindyli> that's possible too. this chart https://issues.gpii.net/secure/attachment/21702/flowmanager-memory-restart.png shows a drop on the memory usage which is likely from GC kick-in if tyler didn't do anything manually
2019-02-19T14:25:10  <cindyli> i'm replying tyler on that JIRA, will include you in
2019-02-19T14:25:15  <Bosmon> Thanks
2019-02-19T14:25:34  <Bosmon> The figures involved are so small it's not clear that there really is a memory leak at all
2019-02-19T14:25:53  <Bosmon> Although "preferences-memory-health" is a bit suspicious in that the leak appears to accumulate over days
2019-02-19T14:26:01  <Bosmon> We should certainly perform some local experiments at some point
2019-02-19T14:26:21  <cindyli> agree
2019-02-19T14:27:04  <cindyli> Bosmon: the local experiments won't be able to last for days
2019-02-19T14:28:08  <Bosmon> cindyli - if there is a real memory leak, it will be visible in the heap monitor after a single request : P
2019-02-19T14:28:19  <cindyli> ok
2019-02-19T14:28:35  <Bosmon> But just to make it show up better we can bombard it with a few hundred requests to the "health" endpoint
