2019-04-28T23:13:46  <sgithens> Bosmon: Are model relay DELETEs not propated by default on a shorthand modelRelay configuration?
2019-04-28T23:18:16  <Bosmon> sgithens - they should be propagated just the same - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L720
2019-04-28T23:21:46  <sgithens> Bosmon: Cool thanks, I'll take a closer look at why this isn't propagating after switching the change to applier on the relay
