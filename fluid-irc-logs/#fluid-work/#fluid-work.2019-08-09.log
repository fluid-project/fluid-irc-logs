2019-08-09T16:06:10  <jhernandez> Justin_o: hey there
2019-08-09T16:06:25  <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello
2019-08-09T16:06:32  <jhernandez> I was going to test your PR against gpii-chrome-extension
2019-08-09T16:06:53  <jhernandez> and I see that there is a problem with the browser tests
2019-08-09T16:06:57  <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/3RHk17JJ
2019-08-09T16:10:32  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks, will take a look.. how did you run the tests?
2019-08-09T16:12:20  <jhernandez> cloned - merged your branch in and ran vagrant run test:vagrant
2019-08-09T16:12:39  <Justin_o> jhernandez: did you run "grunt buildDev" or "grunt build" before running the tests.. and also "npm install" before doing any of that
2019-08-09T16:12:50  <jhernandez> ohhh
2019-08-09T16:12:53  <jhernandez> wait
2019-08-09T16:13:46  <jhernandez> didn't run grunt build
2019-08-09T16:13:55  <jhernandez> only npm install
2019-08-09T16:14:02  <jhernandez> which shouldn't be a problem ..... right?
2019-08-09T16:15:40  <jhernandez> sorry, don't remember if we needed to grunt build before running the tests
2019-08-09T16:16:00  <jhernandez> it's been a long time since I deal with this repo, sorry
2019-08-09T16:16:51  <Justin_o> yah we do, to makes sure all the dependencies are built I believe
2019-08-09T16:17:22  <jhernandez> ok
2019-08-09T16:17:25  <jhernandez> trying now
2019-08-09T16:17:47  <Justin_o> hmm.. maybe I cleaned that up.. I can't remember anymore now either
2019-08-09T16:18:27  <Justin_o> also, I'm assuming you meant you ran "npm run test:vagrant"
2019-08-09T16:18:30  <Justin_o> which should work
2019-08-09T16:22:11  <jhernandez> yes yes, npm run ....
2019-08-09T16:22:22  <jhernandez> and, having same failing test
2019-08-09T16:23:04  <Justin_o> jhernandez: so the test command should actually be running a build for you anyways, so you shouldn't have to worry about it either
2019-08-09T16:23:29  <Justin_o> it's strange though that I'm not getting that error on my end
2019-08-09T16:23:36  <jhernandez> hm
2019-08-09T16:23:41  <jhernandez> interesting
2019-08-09T16:23:46  <jhernandez> version of chrome?
2019-08-09T16:24:22  <jhernandez> mine is Chrome 76.0
2019-08-09T16:24:54  <Justin_o> I'm running it through vagrant as well.. looks like version 76
2019-08-09T16:24:58  <Justin_o> I'm going to destroy the VM now
2019-08-09T16:31:34  <jhernandez> hm
2019-08-09T16:31:56  <jhernandez> Justin_o: can't I load the unpacked extension anymore?
2019-08-09T16:32:15  <Justin_o> jhernandez: yes, you should still be able to do that too
2019-08-09T16:32:41  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I have to run to an appointment, but please let me know how things go and I'll try to look at it some more when I get back. Thanks for testing.
2019-08-09T16:33:17  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-08-09T16:33:19  <jhernandez> no problem
2019-08-09T16:33:23  <Justin_o> I think I just hit the same error in my fresh VM.. will take a look later
2019-08-09T16:33:28  <jhernandez> I'll keep investigating

2019-08-09T17:06:15  <Bosmon4> cindyli - thanks for all of your careful work on the migration script
2019-08-09T17:06:34  <Bosmon4> Sorry that the review might have been more fussy than it could have been, but I imagine we might find ourselves writing quite a few of these
2019-08-09T17:06:44  <Bosmon4> So it might be good to establish a good baseline : P
2019-08-09T17:08:09  <cindyli> agree. thanks for the merge, Bosmon4
2019-08-09T17:18:47  <cindyli> clown: my universal pull request has been merged into the master. Could you update your gpii-infra pull request to point to the new tag - https://ci.gpii.net/job/docker-gpii-universal-master-calculate-tag/33/console
2019-08-09T17:23:34  <jhernandez> Justin_o: well, the bug is certainly solved - but still can't get the tests passing
2019-08-09T17:26:16  <jhernandez> I also tested with the previous version of infusion and the failure is still there
2019-08-09T17:26:23  <clown> can do, cindyli
2019-08-09T17:26:30  <cindyli> thanks, clown

2019-08-09T17:38:14  <cindyli> thanks
2019-08-09T18:07:26  <gmoss> cindyli: hi Cindy, sorry I've been feeling unwell again and was lying down. My internet is still out so I don't think I can check in on video anyway
2019-08-09T18:07:52  <gmoss> Thanks for merging 253
2019-08-09T18:09:08  <cindyli> no problem, gmoss. we can skip the check in if you are not feeling well
2019-08-09T18:20:59  <jhernandez> Justin_o: okay, I'm merging the PR as the test failure is unrelated
2019-08-09T18:21:37  <jhernandez> I'll create a JIRA and assign it to you
