2020-10-13T13:33:41  <gmoss> clown: can you remind me when the prefs framework meeting is? I'm having trouble finding details
2020-10-13T13:34:09  <gmoss> (good morning!)
2020-10-13T13:34:44  <clown> gmoss good morning.
2020-10-13T13:34:49  <clown> Its' 10 - 11 am
2020-10-13T13:34:53  <clown> today
2020-10-13T13:35:32  <gmoss> Okay, thanks! That lines up with my memory of what you said :)
2020-10-13T13:37:47  <clown> I sent email last Friday to fluid-work .  I'll send it again as a reminder.
2020-10-13T13:50:54  <gtirloni> clown: I think it didn't arrive (the email)
2020-10-13T13:51:02  <gtirloni> (from last Friday)
2020-10-13T13:51:18  <Justin_o> clown: I also didn't receive that e-mail
2020-10-13T13:51:28  <clown> oh.  how about my reminder that I just sent about 15 min ago?
2020-10-13T13:51:54  <Justin_o> clown:  I didn't get that either
2020-10-13T13:52:17  <clown> gtirloni, any idea why not?
2020-10-13T13:54:15  <clown> okay, I sent the reminder again, but I used my ocadu email this time.
2020-10-13T13:55:08  <gtirloni> clown: "Oct 08 04:32:08 2020 (1611) post to everyone from clown", this is the last email we got from you
2020-10-13T13:56:02  <clown> this time I got a "could not deliver message" â€” "fluid-work wasn't found at fluidproject.org. "
2020-10-13T13:56:44  <clown> I sent to "fluid-work@fluidproject.org"
2020-10-13T13:58:15  <clown> looking at other messages, should it be "fluid-work@lists.idrc.ocad.ca"?  I'll try that.
2020-10-13T13:58:35  <Justin_o> gtirloni: your e-mail just came throughh
2020-10-13T13:59:02  <gtirloni> I think we haven't been using fluidproject.org for emails for a while, that might be it
2020-10-13T13:59:37  <gtirloni> Received! "Oct 13 13:59:15 2020 (1611) post to fluid-work from clown"
2020-10-13T14:02:33  <clown> colinclark, gmoss, Bosmon, cindyli1, Preferences Service meeting starting now in standup room
2020-10-13T14:02:50  <colinclark> on my way
2020-10-13T14:09:14  <jhernandez> clown: is the prefs server meeting happening?
2020-10-13T14:09:34  <clown> jhernandez, yes.  It's in the IDRC standup room
2020-10-13T14:10:04  <jhernandez> in zoom ... is there a possibility to join using the web client?
2020-10-13T14:10:04  <clown> https://ocadu.zoom.us/j/727986784
2020-10-13T14:10:27  <colinclark> jhernandez: !!!
2020-10-13T14:10:28  <colinclark> yes
2020-10-13T14:10:32  <colinclark> you click the link...
2020-10-13T14:10:39  <colinclark> it will try to coerce you into installing the native client
2020-10-13T14:10:53  <colinclark> and you can click another link on the page that says something about opening it in your web browser
2020-10-13T14:11:05  <colinclark> Zoom has a reasonably good WebRTC client
2020-10-13T14:11:43  <jhernandez> passcode?
2020-10-13T14:11:53  <jhernandez> clown, colinclark: ?

2020-10-13T15:31:57  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: our weekly planning meeting is starting soon
2020-10-13T16:10:07  <alanharnum> oh, this is quite soothing for working from home feelings of isolation: https://window-swap.com/
2020-10-13T16:10:35  <alanharnum> especially if you have extra screen real estate that's not super ergonomic (I have it at top of my portrait-mode 4k side monitor)
2020-10-13T16:11:53  <alanharnum> i'm watching a very good cat sleeping in front of a window in Groton, NY right now when I look away from my main monitor
2020-10-13T16:18:04  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks for sharing.. that fun to look at
2020-10-13T16:21:50  <gmoss> very cool alanharnum
2020-10-13T16:24:43  <clown> gtirloni:  what is the url for our pirate pad.  I'm going to move our notes from the earlier meeting over to "our" space.
2020-10-13T16:24:45  <clown> ?
2020-10-13T16:25:05  <gtirloni> clown: https://pad.inclusivedesign.ca
2020-10-13T16:25:39  <clown> thanks!
2020-10-13T16:26:33  <clown> it looks eerily familiar.
2020-10-13T16:28:27  <gtirloni> :)
2020-10-13T16:29:01  <clown> do you know if there is any way to keep the original colour coding, that shows who wrote what?
2020-10-13T16:29:17  <clown> probably not possible, but just in case.
2020-10-13T16:29:29  <gtirloni> I don't think so... copy/paste erases it
2020-10-13T16:30:28  <clown> yeah.  I'll spend some time putting in some initials.
