2018-11-05T09:29:41  <dandimitrov> Hey, the-t-in-rtf, I was thinking of merging https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/51 in case you don’t have any additional comments :?
2018-11-05T09:30:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm fine with merging it.
2018-11-05T09:36:21  <dandimitrov> Great, thanks
2018-11-05T11:44:42  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf: Do you know whether there’s a way to see Jenkin’s coverage report details (I’m able to see only the console output)?

2018-11-05T12:22:27  <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov - your coverage for the branch now looks great
2018-11-05T12:22:38  <Bosmon> I've added a small further report for a puzzling issue: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3499
2018-11-05T12:22:47  <Bosmon> I think we have seen something like this before but I'm puzzled we don't see it all the time

2018-11-05T12:37:38  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: I’ll might go on and use you’re first suggestion - requiring the gpii-windows
2018-11-05T12:37:46  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - sounds good to me
2018-11-05T12:37:53  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - Any ideas why you don't see this?
2018-11-05T12:38:24  <dandimitrov> I’m a bit frustrated with something else - gpii-glob takes a lot of time to load
2018-11-05T12:38:38  <Bosmon> Very wierd
2018-11-05T12:39:38  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: well, when we run a `npm install` all dependent modules’ dependencies are installed equally in the node_modules folder
2018-11-05T12:39:56  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - I see
2018-11-05T12:40:06  <Bosmon> In theory I am running the same vagrant box as CI
2018-11-05T12:40:08  <dandimitrov> meaining that gpii-app/node_modules/gpii-universal is present
2018-11-05T12:40:19  <Bosmon> So I don't know why my npm is doing it differently
2018-11-05T12:40:33  <Bosmon> Perhaps my box is slightly old
2018-11-05T12:40:40  <dandimitrov> hmm, don’t have clue either...

2018-11-05T12:41:25  <dandimitrov> hmm, what version of npm is it using?

2018-11-05T12:42:51  <Bosmon> npm 5.6.0
2018-11-05T12:43:06  <Bosmon> But I guess this module layout decision is essentially unstable anyway so we should be resistant to it
2018-11-05T12:44:07  <dandimitrov> yep, we’d definatelly have to change it
2018-11-05T12:44:29  <dandimitrov> it’s am interesting questoin though

2018-11-05T13:36:11  <stegru> I've also had the "Cannot find gpii-universal" error - I thought it was my own fault

2018-11-05T15:59:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I was really ready to accept total blame for it as an integration problem, turns out it was just a variable name that needed to be updated.
2018-11-05T15:59:31  <the-t-in-rtf> smallest. pull. ever.
2018-11-05T15:59:42  <the-t-in-rtf> well, maybe not, but very tiny.
