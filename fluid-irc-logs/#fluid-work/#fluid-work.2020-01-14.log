2020-01-14T15:22:18  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I read through the JSDocs docs this morning in some depth
2020-01-14T15:22:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I really don't think there's a way to say "only these properties are allowed here" or "other properties are also allowed"
2020-01-14T15:23:14  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for reading through that
2020-01-14T15:23:31  <the-t-in-rtf> you can really only document specific named required or optional propertiies
2020-01-14T15:23:53  <the-t-in-rtf> no worries, I wanted to follow up to make sure
2020-01-14T15:24:16  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: does that imply that those are the only valid properties, or just that they are the only documented properties
2020-01-14T15:24:36  <the-t-in-rtf> the latter
2020-01-14T15:24:46  <the-t-in-rtf> (at least in my reading)
2020-01-14T15:25:13  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, thanks.. I believe that would be the better case anyways
2020-01-14T15:25:15  <the-t-in-rtf> really, there's no way of saying anything else outside of a textual comment somewhere
2020-01-14T15:25:57  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: after our talk yesterday, I removed the odd syntax I was trying to use and just moved those into parts into the description
2020-01-14T15:26:06  <Justin_o> so only documented the named properties
2020-01-14T15:26:14  <the-t-in-rtf> makes perfect sense, but it was.a good discussion for the future
2020-01-14T15:26:44  <Justin_o> cool :)
2020-01-14T15:27:03  <the-t-in-rtf> Antranig and I have talked about generating one from the other, it's good to see which of the two is clearly the lower fideliity
2020-01-14T15:27:30  <the-t-in-rtf> in theory we could generate low fidelity schemas from the JSDocs if needed, but it seems clear to me that we have a lot more nuance going the other way.
2020-01-14T15:28:01  <the-t-in-rtf> we could even choose to generate boilerplate text in the description like "only the properties specified are allowed" or "additional properties are allowed"
2020-01-14T15:29:33  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, the timing fix for the payload validation tests was merged earlier
2020-01-14T15:29:45  <Justin_o> that's a good point and would be helpful too. Is there a way in JSON Schema to add a test description as well?
2020-01-14T15:30:27  <the-t-in-rtf> very much so
2020-01-14T15:30:36  <the-t-in-rtf> there's a title and description element at each level
2020-01-14T15:30:44  <the-t-in-rtf> we discussed using these as UI hints, but decided not to
2020-01-14T15:30:53  <the-t-in-rtf> but they are there to provide context for elements in the schema
2020-01-14T15:33:24  <Justin_o> Great, that sounds really promising that we'll at least be able to generate the typedefs from the JSON Schemas.. although I guess that would require us to have something that modifies the files in place.
2020-01-14T15:34:37  <Justin_o> assuming we want something that can be seen in an editor and not just docs that are generated to the documentation site
2020-01-14T15:48:19  <the-t-in-rtf> we might have something that simply suggests a typedef that you can copy/paste in
2020-01-14T15:48:42  <the-t-in-rtf> based on any schema
2020-01-14T15:48:47  <the-t-in-rtf> that seems more generally useful
2020-01-14T15:49:05  <Justin_o> okay, so you run something and it generates the typedef out to the terminal for example
2020-01-14T15:49:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I'd rather not have to come up with a structure to handle the mapping and incorporation automatically if we can help it
2020-01-14T15:49:14  <the-t-in-rtf> right, something like that
