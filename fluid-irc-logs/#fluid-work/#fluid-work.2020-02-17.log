2020-02-17T10:33:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, all.
2020-02-17T10:34:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm adding even more checks for our transforms, and have found 50 validation errors that can result from transforms.
2020-02-17T10:34:38  <the-t-in-rtf> We had no way of checking these before, so I'm not too surprised
2020-02-17T10:34:47  <the-t-in-rtf> just to give an illustrative example
2020-02-17T10:34:47  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/657f7c344f167f182e49e66f72719105a11eb3c0/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4905
2020-02-17T10:35:24  <the-t-in-rtf> That valueMapper produces "numbers as strings"
2020-02-17T10:35:30  <the-t-in-rtf> The actual schema expects a number:

2020-02-17T10:35:45  <the-t-in-rtf> This is the kind of thing that tests are very good at catching but people are not as great at

2020-02-17T14:30:56  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m] or @stegru, do either of you know the range of values for this setting?
2020-02-17T14:30:57  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/657f7c344f167f182e49e66f72719105a11eb3c0/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L7718
2020-02-17T14:31:45  <the-t-in-rtf> This makes it seem like the scale is quite large:
2020-02-17T14:31:45  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/657f7c344f167f182e49e66f72719105a11eb3c0/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L7754
2020-02-17T14:32:10  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the (also undocumented) range of the common term gets multiplied by 350 and has 10 added to it.
2020-02-17T14:32:17  <stegru> "Valid values are from 10 to 360."
2020-02-17T14:32:24  <stegru> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-mousekeys
2020-02-17T14:32:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.
2020-02-17T14:32:53  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm doing some rosetta stone work here, trying to figure out two defaults from a single transform.
2020-02-17T14:32:56  <the-t-in-rtf> that really helps.
2020-02-17T14:33:13  <the-t-in-rtf> so the common term is obviously 0 to 1
2020-02-17T14:34:08  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, so what's the default?
2020-02-17T14:39:00  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: microsoft docs says nothing about a default value for it, that could mean, that is system or device dependent

2020-02-17T14:42:47  <the-t-in-rtf1> Yeah, that's not what I was hoping for, but it does make sense that that might be the case.
2020-02-17T14:43:04  <the-t-in-rtf1> I will just pick one for the common term, say 0.5
2020-02-17T14:45:07  *** christop_ <christop_!~textual@24.50.234.55> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-17T14:47:56  <the-t-in-rtf1> sooo
2020-02-17T14:48:31  <the-t-in-rtf1> where did we get the idea that it had to be a multiple of ten?
2020-02-17T14:48:42  <the-t-in-rtf1> seems like that can go?
2020-02-17T14:49:27  <stegru> I don't think I wrote it, but if i did, it may be to match the granularity in control panel
2020-02-17T14:50:21  <stegru> although, I'm not aware that setting is in control panel
2020-02-17T14:52:14  <the-t-in-rtf1> fair enough
2020-02-17T14:52:18  <the-t-in-rtf1> So, next customer
2020-02-17T14:52:18  <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/657f7c344f167f182e49e66f72719105a11eb3c0/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6985
2020-02-17T14:52:31  <the-t-in-rtf1> You'll note that the schema expects a string and the transform produces an array of strings.
2020-02-17T14:52:34  <the-t-in-rtf1> which is it?
2020-02-17T14:52:46  <the-t-in-rtf1> I assume that Languages is an array, right?
2020-02-17T15:18:17  <Bosmon> So, in chatting with christop_ it has emerged that changes have been merged to respective masters that have broken "set" settings handlers
2020-02-17T15:18:19  <christop_> Hey bosmon -- do you know why the "Set" settings handlers don't fire after the recent #gpii-universal checkin?
2020-02-17T15:18:35  <Bosmon> Which I would have thought was impossible since this should be being verified by the acceptance tests
2020-02-17T15:18:37  <christop_> gpii-universal 0.3.0-dev.20200128T170154Z.eaac9112e specifically.
2020-02-17T15:18:55  <christop_> Yeah, it surprised me too.
2020-02-17T15:19:58  <christop_> Maybe I have something odd in my dev environment, but I tested this on two different computers and got the same results.  I had to switch back to JavierJF/universal#GPII-3810 temporarily to be able to continue working with "set" handlers (i.e. changing the language, changing the screen zoom/resolution, etc.)
2020-02-17T15:20:20  <Bosmon> christop_ - looking at recent list of closed pulls https://github.com/GPII/universal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed - I don't see anything that leaps out as being potentially responsible
2020-02-17T15:21:28  <Bosmon> This is the one which had the deepest impact on the core settings lifecycle: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/841
2020-02-17T15:21:53  <Bosmon> christop_ - but perhaps the issue in question is the change in the "PSP API"?
2020-02-17T15:22:18  <Bosmon> But this shouldn't have been picked up because the relevant masters are not meant to be in step
2020-02-17T15:22:31  <Bosmon> It is a known issue that the current gpii-app master is not compatible with the current gpii-universal master
2020-02-17T15:23:55  <Bosmon> christop_ - this is the pull which is meant to restore compatibility: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/178
2020-02-17T15:24:41  <Bosmon> But it's not clear that this is the phenomenon you are talking about
2020-02-17T15:24:59  <Bosmon> You are saying that the current configuration as addressed from gpii-app master and its current dependencies is broken?
2020-02-17T15:25:17  <christop_> I'm rebuilding ATM; one moment please :)
2020-02-17T15:25:54  <christop_> "It is a known issue that the current gpii-app master is not compatible with the current gpii-universal master"
2020-02-17T15:25:58  <christop_> Ah, that may explain everything.
2020-02-17T15:26:27  <christop_> "But this shouldn't have been picked up because the relevant masters are not meant to be in step" <-- makes sense, since the dependencies are linked by NPM tags, and not by pulling the most recent source.
2020-02-17T15:26:34  <Bosmon> We only ever update the dependencies as referenced by the upstream projects once they are actually compatible..... so gpii-app is only guaranteed to be compatible with the particular npm tags that it references
2020-02-17T15:27:38  <christop_> Bosmon -- okay, so I see now that gpii-app is still referencing the December GPII-4253 build.
2020-02-17T15:27:54  <Bosmon> christop_ - right
2020-02-17T15:27:56  <christop_> I just learned something new.  This appears to be my bad assumption that the latest source from each was the way to go.
2020-02-17T15:27:57  <christop_> My bad :)
2020-02-17T15:28:43  <Bosmon> christop_ - it was, in retrospect, an error to structure the project around independent git repos, but in practice a mistake that we found we didn't have the resources to correct
2020-02-17T15:29:09  <christop_> I understand.
2020-02-17T15:29:20  <Bosmon> On the one hand, it does give us slightly more agility in allowing work to progress in some areas without expecting everything to move in lockstep
2020-02-17T15:29:36  <christop_> I did update the gpii-universal reference in my GPII-4355 branch to use the same commit level.
2020-02-17T15:29:37  <christop_> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/295/commits/bb1983e54b2db2abfabd2efe73b309b703d3842b
2020-02-17T15:29:40  <Bosmon> But on the other hand we end up with the costs of more limited and less timely integration testing than we really should have
2020-02-17T15:29:46  <christop_> Understood.
2020-02-17T15:30:09  <Bosmon> I know that Google, for example, uses exactly the opposite approach - they have one single GIGANTIC repo against which everything has to be integrated in real time
2020-02-17T15:32:01  <Bosmon> And when we started this project, the "monorepo" pattern that many large git/npm projects use to structure their work wasn't yet described
2020-02-17T15:32:58  <Bosmon> In fact, when we started, it was mildly controversial that gpii-universal was just one single "giant" repo rather than the 20 that its classically described structure would have recommended it be : P
2020-02-17T15:33:24  <Bosmon> Under the "micromodule" thinking that was so fashionable back then, each of these https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules should have been its own git repo
2020-02-17T15:33:34  <Bosmon> So at least we didn't make the very largest blunder that we could possible have made : P
2020-02-17T15:36:12  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf1: I'm afraid I don't know about that particular setting
2020-02-17T15:36:57  <the-t-in-rtf1> well
2020-02-17T15:37:05  <the-t-in-rtf1> I guess we'll find out… ;)
2020-02-17T15:37:17  <javjarfer[m]> but I think that it may just that the registry settings handler needs a array of string to map it to the "REG_MULTI_SZ" type, I'm just guessing
2020-02-17T15:37:24  <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, we can't go around expecting one thing and transforming common terms into the other
2020-02-17T15:37:39  <the-t-in-rtf1> looking at all the other language settings it seems like array is safe
2020-02-17T15:47:53  *** the-t-in-rtf1 is now known as the-t-in-rtf
2020-02-17T15:48:15  <christop_> I'm glad we didn't make each folder in ./gpii/node_modules into different modules.  Holy cow that would have a lot of nano-modules :)
2020-02-17T15:57:45  <Bosmon> christop_ - so it seems that this mysterious absence of the 4.5.1 SDK might be a relatively recent phenomenon: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/178
2020-02-17T15:57:51  <Bosmon> "Not so long ago", pulls like this would actually build : P
2020-02-17T16:05:47  <christop_> Bosmon -- oh wow.
2020-02-17T16:07:08  <Bosmon> Like, two weeks ago
2020-02-17T16:07:19  <Bosmon> It looks like those "gremlins" have both given and taken away
