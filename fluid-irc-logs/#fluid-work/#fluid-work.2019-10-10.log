2019-10-10T13:08:00  <jhernandez> Bosmon: https://pastebin.com/EhujbJcj
2019-10-10T13:08:24  <jhernandez> there's something wrong going on
2019-10-10T13:08:37  <jhernandez> also, the QS interface is completely empty
2019-10-10T13:08:49  <jhernandez> it's there, but no buttons
2019-10-10T13:08:59  <jhernandez> just a big blank rectangle
2019-10-10T13:09:40  <jhernandez> I will keep going later and see if I can figure out what's going on
2019-10-10T13:09:52  <jhernandez> but the infusion failure is .... weird

2019-10-10T13:52:12  <jhernandez> right
2019-10-10T13:53:19  <jhernandez> in fact I checked just in case there was an infusion change around
2019-10-10T13:53:40  <jhernandez> and seems to be the "right one"

2019-10-10T13:54:04  <jhernandez> the funny thing is that it only appears when trying to run the tests
2019-10-10T13:54:43  <jhernandez> I can run the app without getting that error (but the app is not functional as I said earlier)
2019-10-10T13:57:04  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: just to make sure we are on the same page, is the google cloud database to evaluate the Cloud Firestore - https://cloud.google.com/firestore/, which is the next generation of Cloud Datastore
2019-10-10T14:08:53  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, I think it's the opposite, the new Datastore is a specially configured version of Firestore

2019-10-10T14:09:30  <the-t-in-rtf> https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/
2019-10-10T14:09:47  <the-t-in-rtf> That's the one we need to evaluate in terms of writing/reading data, supported structures, searching, etc.
2019-10-10T14:11:20  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i see what you mean, it's "Cloud Firestore in Datastore mode"
2019-10-10T14:11:24  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-10-10T14:12:20  <cindyli> great. thanks
