2019-07-24T09:23:07  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @Bosmon or anyone else keeping score, I have confirmed that if I switch the PSP channel tests to use the windows grades, it works, but only if I run the integration and dev tests first.
2019-07-24T09:24:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I will try to narrow it down, but it seems like we'll need at least two rounds of fixes, one to get the mocks the right kind of dirty to pass CI, another to reset the mocks and fix any errors revealed.
2019-07-24T09:29:56  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, running just the integration tests first allows it to pass.
2019-07-24T09:30:14  <the-t-in-rtf> Trying now with just the dev tests.
2019-07-24T09:30:32  <the-t-in-rtf> that was fast, with just the dev tests dies as usual.
2019-07-24T09:34:32  <the-t-in-rtf> As you might expect, seems like it's tests/platform/index-windows.js that primes the mocks.
2019-07-24T09:38:37  <the-t-in-rtf> jackpot.
2019-07-24T09:38:56  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/dea903d5192668f59323d385534c5cc704c6e0f1/tests/platform/index-windows.js#L26
2019-07-24T09:39:20  <the-t-in-rtf> Only running the builtIn test spec primes the mocks well enough for the PSP channel tests to pass.
2019-07-24T09:39:37  <the-t-in-rtf> continuing down the well
2019-07-24T09:41:40  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/aa30145076127c33e2b274bae51a704dd01e6570/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L1792
2019-07-24T09:41:57  <the-t-in-rtf> The tests fail if I only run the builtIn ones, but pass if I only run the high contrast.
2019-07-24T09:48:15  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I can get the PSP channel tests working in isolation
2019-07-24T09:48:33  <the-t-in-rtf> by adding gpii.test.integration.actionHandlersAware.windows to the context's gradeNames
2019-07-24T09:49:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I will tidy up what I have and submit for review shortly.  I hope it will be adequate until mock-clearing work is done.

2019-07-24T10:49:53  <the-t-in-rtf> setting up for a local vagrant run, but those tests have always worked in isolation for me.
2019-07-24T10:59:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to move the listener tests forward, I left a TODO about cleaning up the order once the mocks are isolated between tests.
2019-07-24T10:59:21  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the user listener tests work on their own but fail if run last.

2019-07-24T14:07:37  <alanharnum> Justin_o: I guess I don't really understand what is being suggested, aside from the general "make more Grunt-like".
2019-07-24T14:08:49  <alanharnum> Q1: Should we be generating the list of files to check in /dist/ programatically? Q2: What would this look like, run-wise? Targets like verifyDistFiles:JS, verifyDistFiles:CSS, etc?
2019-07-24T14:09:14  <Justin_o> alanharnum: I guess that is the gist of it :) It would be more consistent to configure the files in the standard config location in grunt. for example if we add another font or remove one we'd have to modify the function instead of the config.
2019-07-24T14:10:12  <Justin_o> alanharnum: I'm not sure if this is exactly possible because there are distinction between the CSS, JS, and font tests, but it would be ideal if they were actually a single verification task that you just had targets for with the specific config for each.
2019-07-24T14:10:42  <Justin_o> then if we need to validate templates, message bundles, etc, it would just be adding another target.
2019-07-24T14:11:03  <alanharnum> Justin_o: OK, I think we're on the same page then - I'll factor towards that.
2019-07-24T14:11:41  <Justin_o> alanharnum: okay great... thinking now though how would changes for https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6359 affect this
2019-07-24T14:12:44  *** jhung is now known as jhung_away
2019-07-24T14:12:55  <Justin_o> I'm not entirely sure where we'll go with that yet, it could be copying over the entire src dir into dist, it could be only putting templates and messages into related directories in dist, or copying over src minus the JS files used to create the infusion-all.js
2019-07-24T14:13:03  <Justin_o> could be something else too, but probably one of those
2019-07-24T14:13:07  <Justin_o> alanharnum: ^
2019-07-24T14:15:03  <alanharnum> Justin_o: I don't think it will change it too significantly (at least while we still have current build process). A change to the /dist directory structure / files will require changes to any code that verifies the /dist directory structure / files. I think what I can do for now is refactor what we currently have to make that change easier in the future by putting what's possible to configure on the grunt config, etc.
2019-07-24T14:17:27  <Justin_o> alanharnum: awesome thanks... if there is going to be too much throw away work though, don't worry, we can tackle it in that other JIRA instead.
2019-07-24T14:18:11  <alanharnum> Justin_o: No, I had a similar thought along these lines yesterday - I remember (like two years ago) writing those "verifyDist" tasks quickly because we had some issues with the dist build process, and thinking then "these should be more grunt-like".
2019-07-24T14:18:40  <alanharnum> So I'll tackle them now while they're in front of me, shouldn't take too long.
2019-07-24T14:19:16  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks so much :)

2019-07-24T18:09:26  <Justin_o> colinclark: but another interesting thing is that I don't see any contributors from Berkeley on the contributors list.
2019-07-24T18:09:41  <colinclark> That doesn’t actually surprise me
2019-07-24T18:10:09  <colinclark> I suppose it’s possible that there’s still some of Eli’s code deep in the uploader, but it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s been removed over the years
2019-07-24T18:10:46  <Justin_o> colinclark: although running this command against the repo  does show 536 lines authored by Eli.
2019-07-24T18:10:47  <Justin_o> git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD | grep -E './' | xargs -n1 git blame -w --line-porcelain | grep "^author "|sort|uniq -c|sort -nr
2019-07-24T18:10:53  <Justin_o> that ignores whitespace changes.
2019-07-24T18:11:06  <Justin_o> in terms of authorship
2019-07-24T18:11:16  <colinclark> interesting
2019-07-24T18:11:55  <Justin_o> however, I don't know what those lines were. They could all be comments, or something like that, or html files.
2019-07-24T18:12:00  <Justin_o> Or could be real code
2019-07-24T18:12:39  <Justin_o> colinclark: it could be something like this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blame/master/src/components/textfieldControl/js/TextfieldStepper.js
2019-07-24T18:13:35  <Justin_o> I removed the copyright for this because I believe it was refactored/replaced enough.. although let me know if I'm wrong about that.
2019-07-24T18:13:40  <colinclark> Imagine being the exclusive author of some whitespace? :)
2019-07-24T18:13:46  <Justin_o> lol
2019-07-24T18:13:59  <colinclark> 
2019-07-24T18:15:19  <Justin_o> colinclark: it's funny, if you look at the number of changes I have made, it looks like I've done as much as Bosmon, but it's probably mostly due to project wide refactoring of directories and things like he copyrights ;)
2019-07-24T18:16:20  <colinclark> you’ve done so much work on Infusion
2019-07-24T18:17:04  <Justin_o> colinclark: so in this file it looks like the only changes left are related to braces and whitespace https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blame/master/src/components/uploader/js/FileQueue.js
2019-07-24T18:17:15  <Justin_o> but I guess it's hard to determine if the logic is still present but was just moved around
2019-07-24T18:19:02  <colinclark> I’m SO proud of that }; I contributed on line 119
2019-07-24T18:21:18  <Justin_o> lol
