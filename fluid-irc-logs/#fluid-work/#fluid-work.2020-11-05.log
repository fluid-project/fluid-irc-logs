2020-11-05T17:00:48  <gmoss> Justin_o: sure. My next step is to remind myself why the audioBlockEditor has the explicit turn on/off logic for its placeholder, I can't quite remember and my notes from when I added it are quite vague, so I need to rack my brain. Beyond that, it's a matter of adding new tests
2020-11-05T17:01:00  <gmoss> so any missing test coverage from the changes, really
2020-11-05T17:12:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, and has everything been pushed up to your branch?
2020-11-05T17:14:18  <gmoss> Justin_o: checking..
2020-11-05T17:14:23  <gmoss> (I think so)
2020-11-05T17:14:34  <Justin_o> okay, thanks.. I'll try to take a look this afternoon
2020-11-05T17:15:20  <gmoss> Justin_o: excellent. thank you! confirmed: my SJRK-289 branch latest work has been pushed up to my remote
2020-11-05T17:15:30  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
