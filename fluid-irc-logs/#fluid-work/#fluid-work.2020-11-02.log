2020-11-02T13:40:45  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I think you were the one looking into Snyk originally.. is that something we still need given the built in checks from GitHub?
2020-11-02T14:38:46  <Justin_o> greatislander: I'm looking over https://github.com/fluid-project/build.fluidproject.org/pull/25
2020-11-02T14:39:16  <greatislander[m]> Yes?
2020-11-02T14:39:24  <Justin_o> greatislander: so there are some missing links, they are also missing from the current build site. Did you want to add those in now, or will you be updating that page to automatically find the URLs for demos, examples, and tests
2020-11-02T14:40:03  <greatislander[m]> That change needs some more consideration, so it should be addressed separately.
2020-11-02T14:41:31  <greatislander[m]> I'd like to keep the scope of this PR narrowly defined, just to update the existing links if that's okay
2020-11-02T14:42:18  <Justin_o> greatislander[m]: we should plan to add the missing links in shortly, if the redesign is going to take a while longer
2020-11-02T14:42:54  <Justin_o> greatislander[m]: Also what exactly is deployed and exposed through netlify?
2020-11-02T14:43:54  <Justin_o> For example I'm noticing that Infusion PRs are getting a status checks for the Netlify deploy but clicking details returns https://deploy-preview-1030--build-infusion.netlify.app
2020-11-02T14:44:10  <greatislander[m]> The same build process that was used in the old Jenkins task is now run on Netlify and the results are deployed to https://build-infusion.netlify.app
2020-11-02T14:44:20  <greatislander[m]> Infusion doesn't create an index.html file for itself
2020-11-02T14:44:45  <Justin_o> I can see how it would actually be useful to have access to the demos and etc on PRs, but if the links are broken it might be better to just not run the deploy previews on PRs.
2020-11-02T14:45:14  <greatislander[m]> Justin_o: The links aren't broken
2020-11-02T14:45:40  <Justin_o> greatislander[m]: well I guess it requires someone to know how to construct the URL themselves
2020-11-02T14:45:48  <greatislander[m]> Yes, that's correct
2020-11-02T14:46:40  <Justin_o> but you can appreciate how clicking on the "details" link in the status check makes it look broken
2020-11-02T14:46:44  <Justin_o> by returning a 404
2020-11-02T14:47:07  <greatislander[m]> I think the solution to this would be to generate a simple index for the infusion build
2020-11-02T14:47:13  <greatislander[m]> And deploy that as part of the Netlify process
2020-11-02T14:47:44  <greatislander[m]> The same process could be used to provide the list of links to the build site to generate the homepage there
2020-11-02T14:48:21  <greatislander[m]> We can turn off the deploy previews though, in the meantime
2020-11-02T14:48:41  <Justin_o> greatislander[m]: sounds like a good plan, thanks.
2020-11-02T14:49:03  <greatislander[m]> which one? :)
2020-11-02T14:49:15  <greatislander[m]> I've done this for now:
2020-11-02T14:49:16  <greatislander[m]> > We can turn off the deploy previews though, in the meantime
2020-11-02T14:50:09  <Justin_o> the whole thing :) turn off for now and add the generation step that you mentioned, which would help for both this case and the build site. And we can turn the deploy previews back on once the index generation is in place.
2020-11-02T14:50:17  <greatislander[m]> okay, sounds good
2020-11-02T14:50:24  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-11-02T14:51:21  <Justin_o> greatislander[m]: how long do the deploys stay up on Netlify, the ones from master that is?
2020-11-02T14:51:46  <greatislander[m]> The production deploys?
2020-11-02T14:51:46  <Justin_o> wondering if we'd be able to view past deploys, or does it overwrite deploys from the same branch?
2020-11-02T14:52:11  <greatislander[m]> It's essentially a production site so no, you wouldn't be able to view past deploys
2020-11-02T14:53:21  <Justin_o> okay, and the PR ones will hang around until the branch for the PR is removed?
2020-11-02T14:53:28  <greatislander[m]> I believe so, yes
2020-11-02T14:53:36  <greatislander[m]> I think they may hang around for an extra week or so
2020-11-02T14:53:40  <greatislander[m]> but not too long
2020-11-02T14:54:10  <Justin_o> okay.. we might want to look at building our tags so we can access demos for the stable releases, but we don't have to worry about that till we finally do another release
2020-11-02T14:55:10  <Justin_o> or maybe when we update the docs site to output version docs, that might also be a good time to re-explore this
2020-11-02T14:55:16  <greatislander[m]> I think that would be a separate project altogetherâ€” gtirloni and my goal with this was simply to get the "nightly builds" off of Jenkins. But it would be good to make a JIRA for that.
2020-11-02T14:58:50  <gtirloni> agreed. I think building on Netlify is achieving the same that was achieved with our Jenkins pipeline (that is, not much.. it just builds and copies files)
2020-11-02T14:59:14  <gtirloni> it'd be nice to improve on that, involve GitHub Actions in deploying things to npm through tags, etc.. but it's a separate project, I agree
2020-11-02T15:36:33  <Justin_o> greatislander[m], gtirloni: I've filed a new JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6572
