2019-01-21T15:29:50  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i was poking into your GPII-3619 branch (replace pouch to couch for universal node tests) to see if I can help with the problems you are having. it seems the couchDB docker container, or test harness, doesn't start automatically when running a node test, for example "node gpii/node_modules/couchConnector/test/couchConnectorTests.js", so hitting this error - https://pastebin.com/e3AFrLxW. Is there a step I need to do to
2019-01-21T15:29:51  <cindyli> get couch harness start before running a node test?

2019-01-21T15:54:44  <the-t-in-rtf> and thanks for trying to run the tests
2019-01-21T15:54:57  <the-t-in-rtf> the error in the logs very much looks like it can't even try to start the container
2019-01-21T15:55:12  <the-t-in-rtf> docker needs to be installed, running, and part of your path
2019-01-21T15:55:31  <the-t-in-rtf> by "running", I mean the daemon
2019-01-21T15:59:09  <cindyli> thanks, the-t-in-rtf. giving a try
2019-01-21T16:04:36  <cindyli> having docker running does solve the problem.

2019-01-21T16:18:05  <the-t-in-rtf> that's awesome to hear @cindyli
2019-01-21T16:18:30  <the-t-in-rtf> it's supposed to be pretty straightforward
2019-01-21T16:23:36  <cindyli> agree, quite straightforward so far
2019-01-21T16:24:04  <alanharnum> they've made a lot of improvements to the local dev experience of Docker in the last few years
2019-01-21T16:24:38  <alanharnum> interesting to hear it's at a point where the test harness is switching over to Docker-based Couch rather than Pouch (if I am understanding correctly)
2019-01-21T16:26:04  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S01069050ca694f23.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-21T16:27:31  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, there were memory issues especially with the large suites of tests like we have in universal
2019-01-21T16:27:48  <the-t-in-rtf> plus it turns out pouch isn't a 100% faithful mock of couchdb
2019-01-21T16:28:25  <the-t-in-rtf> CouchDB is stricter about bringing docs into view output by emiting docs with an _id value
2019-01-21T16:28:52  <colinclark> it sounds like Pouch is still probably quite interesting from the perspective of making client-side software that can persist locally and then sync with a remote CouchDB...
2019-01-21T16:29:00  <colinclark> but its Node.js implementation doesn't sound awesome
2019-01-21T16:29:11  <colinclark> and hence not the best as a mock for a real Couch server

2019-01-21T16:29:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess the syncing bit is a bit tricky
2019-01-21T16:30:17  <colinclark> interesting; how so, the-t-in-rtf?
2019-01-21T16:30:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not sure if you can call the sync from a browser-based pouch instance
2019-01-21T16:30:53  <the-t-in-rtf> you interact with a browser-based pouch instance more as an object than as a REST endpoint
2019-01-21T16:30:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I'd have to read up on it
2019-01-21T16:30:59  <the-t-in-rtf> it very well may be possible
2019-01-21T16:31:43  <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2019-01-21T16:31:43  <the-t-in-rtf> https://pouchdb.com/api.html#replication
2019-01-21T16:32:09  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.102> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-21T16:33:53  <the-t-in-rtf> so you could reuse views and non-view data, certainly
2019-01-21T16:34:10  <colinclark> I'm confused how it's tricky
2019-01-21T16:34:24  <the-t-in-rtf> well, tricky in that you need two approaches
2019-01-21T16:34:26  <colinclark> isn't that a one-liner to replicate from a browser-based Pouch instance to a Couch server?
2019-01-21T16:34:28  <colinclark> :)
2019-01-21T16:35:26  <colinclark> you're thinking more of wanting to reuse the same components on client and server, and have them transparently persist to either Pouch when running the browser or to Couch when in Node or something?
2019-01-21T16:37:57  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I was also thinking about the differences between pulling data from each, but you could certainly use pouchdb to make most things possible offline, as long as you can retrigger and communicate the sync status
2019-01-21T16:39:20  <the-t-in-rtf> then you're mainly concerned about whatever the performance impact and security concerns around syncing your whole db with the user's browser
2019-01-21T16:39:45  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. there are only certain types of data you would want the user to potentially have complete access to from the dev console
2019-01-21T16:40:16  <the-t-in-rtf> and then on the sync end you'd have to decide how to compartmentalise things on the server such that people can't blow away or see each other's data
2019-01-21T16:40:35  <the-t-in-rtf> so if you had one couch db with its own credentials per user, that might work
2019-01-21T16:42:35  <stegru> jhernandez: so, after 1.5 hours we ended up with 2 bugs that have already been fixed :)
2019-01-21T16:42:46  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah
2019-01-21T16:43:04  <jhernandez> those two that we previously announced that in fact were bugs
2019-01-21T16:43:20  <jhernandez> and both pushed to 1.1
2019-01-21T16:43:31  * jhernandez shrugs
2019-01-21T16:46:52  <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: That makes sense to me
2019-01-21T16:47:03  *** jhung is now known as jhung_away
2019-01-21T16:47:07  <colinclark> thanks for the summary
2019-01-21T16:48:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I know it's possible, a friend did something similar with point-of-sale terminals on airplanes
2019-01-21T16:49:19  <the-t-in-rtf> probably they did the syncing "per plane", as they had a server closet for the wifi solution they provided
2019-01-21T16:49:41  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the plane had its own sale data for the data, and that would be synced when possible, but keep racking up transactions in flight
2019-01-21T16:49:48  <the-t-in-rtf> literally
2019-01-21T17:06:53  <the-t-in-rtf> @colinclark, thinking about it further, you might model a proper couchdb instance as a collection of all known data, and then provision a per-user instance based on a skeleton with your common material (views and non-volatile data), plus only the data that belongs to that uer
2019-01-21T17:07:16  <the-t-in-rtf> you could make that a single db that the user can sync at will and leave it there
2019-01-21T17:08:14  <the-t-in-rtf> or you can have some kind of mechanism that controls the flow of data to and from into the larger pool depending on what you want to retain
2019-01-21T17:11:09  <colinclark> yes, I think that's typical in what I've read back when "offline first" with pouch/couch was being written about
2019-01-21T17:11:21  <colinclark> that you should consider that the "local" database is entirely the user's own

2019-01-21T18:12:11  <colinclark> hey jhernandez, can you remind me where i'd find a release of Morphic?
2019-01-21T18:12:30  <colinclark> I'm interested in having a look at how you handle the file system layout of the resources required by the Morphic app
2019-01-21T18:13:09  <colinclark> I've noticed that there's an asymmetric with Electron apps, where the packager moves everything into a "resources\app" directory, and so the Kettle loader, etc. can't find configs when it tries to load them
2019-01-21T18:13:35  <colinclark> I'm thinking that you probably get around this by some manual copying in the installer process?

2019-01-21T18:19:16  <jhernandez> but yeah, we manually copy the folder
2019-01-21T18:19:49  <colinclark> so basically, you arrange so that the source/configs/everything is not located inside resources\app?
2019-01-21T18:20:09  <jhernandez> colinclark: the copying magic happens here https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/provisioning/Installer.ps1
2019-01-21T18:20:32  <jhernandez> we put everything into resources/app
2019-01-21T18:21:22  <jhernandez> the thing is that we needed to run the electron packager against a different folder than the repo, that caused some problems

2019-01-21T18:22:20  <colinclark> when you say "everything in resources/app" do you mean that you also copy the exe in there?
2019-01-21T18:23:59  <jhernandez> not exactly
2019-01-21T18:24:27  <colinclark> ok
2019-01-21T18:25:00  <jhernandez> the exe goes into a different folder

2019-01-21T19:32:45  <alanharnum> rbhatia46: hello Rahul, thanks for your interest - you can have a look at what information we have available so far at this page on our wiki: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2019+with+the+Fluid+Project

2019-01-21T19:37:42  <rbhatia46> Thanks for the reply. I was going through the projects and would like to contribute to FLOE project
2019-01-21T19:38:00  <rbhatia46> Can you give me the GitHub link to the same so that I can have a look ?

2019-01-21T19:47:53  <alanharnum> rbhatia46: FLOE has a number of different codebases; I'd suggest getting started by looking at Infusion, the Javascript framework we use to do most of our work: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion
2019-01-21T19:48:18  <alanharnum> rbhatia46: a good starting point is the tutorial at https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-developerIntroduction/DeveloperIntroductionToInfusionFramework-OpeningRemarks.html

2019-01-21T20:50:28  <gmoss> simonjb: I've confirmed that the SJRK-174 front-end PR doesn't require any changes to the server project
2019-01-21T20:50:38  <gmoss> and have left a comment to that effect
2019-01-21T20:51:25  <gmoss> I expect that once that is merged in, it won't be long for a PR for SJRK-190 to be filed
2019-01-21T20:52:24  <simonjb> thanks gmoss
2019-01-21T20:54:17  <simonjb> gmoss, michelled: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/pull/5
2019-01-21T20:54:37  <gmoss> simonjb: awesome, I'll take a look now

2019-01-21T21:30:46  <gmoss> otherwise it looks good
2019-01-21T21:31:17  <gmoss> that is to say it looks good either way :)
