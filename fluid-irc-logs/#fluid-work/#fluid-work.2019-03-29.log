2019-03-29T10:11:16  <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon !
2019-03-29T10:12:35  <Bosmon> stegru - thanks for that pull - I imagine it signals an Infusion bug
2019-03-29T10:12:42  <Bosmon> Morning javjarfer[m]!

2019-03-29T10:22:44  <Bosmon> There's an appalling sentence if there ever was one
2019-03-29T10:28:58  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: hi! sorry I was taking a final look to this before asking you

2019-03-29T10:45:22  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  well, no, still in the same spot, so thing is that I put a breakpoint here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L749
2019-03-29T10:49:35  <javjarfer[m]> expecting to see when the solution was called with the "handlerType" "SettingsHandler", but it never happens! Also, I discovered that changing the https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/1abe12465d4f5b63d9d247756b4d52cca05346ea/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6091
2019-03-29T11:07:46  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - what did you find when changing what?
2019-03-29T11:08:37  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - and so I imagine the next step is to trace this to the next spot upstream
2019-03-29T11:08:50  <Bosmon> Is the settingsHandler block present during executeActions here? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L897
2019-03-29T11:09:47  <Bosmon> And then of course finally upstream to this site where we accept the original "lifecycleInstructions" - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L1245

2019-03-29T11:17:19  <javjarfer[m]> sorry Bosmon I thought I ended the sentence, changing the block "configureCursorThickness" in favor of a one using "spiSettingsHandler" instead of "registrySettingsHandler" again, makes the solution work
2019-03-29T11:21:29  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that's certainly pretty odd, I can't see any obvious logic in the lifecycleManager deduplicating on that
2019-03-29T11:21:51  <Bosmon> It will be best to trace it through gpii.lifecycleManager.executeActions and find out what happens to it
2019-03-29T11:25:52  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: true? When I saw that yesterday at the end of day I was like: WHAT?
2019-03-29T11:25:57  <javjarfer[m]> A final punch to my brain
2019-03-29T11:39:57  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I think I found it, so when actionBlock is "configure" for this solution, the configure block from the 'solutionRecord' is empty, as you can see here

2019-03-29T11:44:46  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that's odd, why is it?
2019-03-29T11:44:53  <Bosmon> I see there is a block named "configure" registered
2019-03-29T11:49:03  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, I thought the oddity was it being empty
2019-03-29T11:51:15  <javjarfer[m]> it's there, but I thought it should contains ["settings.configure",
2019-03-29T11:51:15  <javjarfer[m]> "settings.configureCursorThickness"], like the "isRunning" block contains ["launchers.launcher"]

2019-03-29T14:15:17  <javjarfer[m]> because there is a value for "cursorSize" I don't know why "cursorThickness" not having a value should affect "cursorSize"
2019-03-29T14:15:45  <Bosmon> I thought it was the "configureCursorThickness" settingsHandler block which was gone?
2019-03-29T14:16:07  <javjarfer[m]> oh no, it's the other one
2019-03-29T14:16:07  <javjarfer[m]> the first one
2019-03-29T14:16:30  <javjarfer[m]> my fault, I should have been more explicit about that
2019-03-29T14:16:32  <Bosmon> Your screenshot shows it was still there
2019-03-29T14:18:40  <Bosmon> Earlier you pasted a screenshot showing that there was one settingsHandler block in the instructions, the first one for "configure"
2019-03-29T14:18:43  <Bosmon> Which seems correct to me
2019-03-29T14:18:57  <Bosmon> And the "configureCursorThickness" block has been weeded out

2019-03-29T14:38:52  <Bosmon> I was thinking we wouldn't want to go into production without trying to fix the leak
2019-03-29T14:39:10  <jhernandez> aside from the leak that both you and cindyli found, is there anything else that you can think this leak might affect"??
2019-03-29T14:39:20  <Bosmon> jhernandez - should be no other effect
2019-03-29T14:39:24  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-29T14:39:29  <Bosmon> The leak is extremely tiny and relevant only in a very long-lived context
2019-03-29T14:39:36  <Bosmon> It leaks 272 bytes per dynamically created component
2019-03-29T14:39:58  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-29T14:40:47  <jhernandez> hmmm, but now that is pushed, it might end up in prd
2019-03-29T14:42:02  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: sry, out of the meeting now
2019-03-29T14:42:57  <javjarfer[m]> yes, that's correct but "settings.configure" is also removed from the array
2019-03-29T14:45:25  <javjarfer[m]> so the array looks like this, prior to the call of "gpii.transformer.arrayDifference" ["settings.configure", "settings.configureCursorThickness"], and it's called with "elementToRemove" being "settings.configureCursorThickness" and the resulting array is []
2019-03-29T14:55:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I can't see how

2019-03-29T18:28:21  <cindyli> have time, sorry
2019-03-29T18:37:21  <clown> sure.
2019-03-29T18:37:29  * clown getting headphones ready
2019-03-29T18:39:32  <clown> just a minute cindyli…
2019-03-29T18:45:49  <clown> okay cindyli, I'm ready.  What are we using?  Vidyo?
2019-03-29T18:46:07  <cindyli> sure. calling you, clown
2019-03-29T18:57:42  <clown> cindyli:  GPII-3832

2019-03-29T19:01:13  *** colinclark <colinclark!colinclark@nat/ocadu/x-piepjzqlnduipxlh> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-29T19:17:27  <cindyli> gmoss: regarding your thoughts in https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-241: "Similarly, the browser tests for the UI-side flag should also check both values. This may require reworking how the UI-side flag works (e.g. turning it into a model value and using relays)"
2019-03-29T19:17:51  <cindyli> you may wanna rethink if this flag should be passed into the model
2019-03-29T19:18:50  <cindyli> i feel this flag is more like an option of the app. once it's set to a value, this value will stay as is
2019-03-29T19:18:52  <gmoss> cindyli: I vaguely recall it's something we discussed yesterday or the day before. Do you think it may not be wise? I can foresee a couple of complications with making that change. I can take that part out of the Jira description if you like
2019-03-29T19:18:53  <gmoss> yeah
2019-03-29T19:19:23  <gmoss> semantically it does fit being an option more than being a mutable value
2019-03-29T19:19:25  <cindyli> the model is more like to react to changing values during the app usage
2019-03-29T19:19:32  <cindyli> exactly
2019-03-29T19:19:54  <cindyli> seems to be it's more appropriate to treat as an option rather than a model value
2019-03-29T19:19:59  <cindyli> to be -> to me
2019-03-29T19:21:12  <gmoss> cindyli: i concur
2019-03-29T19:21:15  <gmoss> I'll remove that comment :)
2019-03-29T19:21:25  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
2019-03-29T19:24:31  <cindyli> gmoss, michelled, i've merged the pull request into the dev branch. happy testing...
2019-03-29T19:26:17  <gmoss> thanks, cindyli!
2019-03-29T19:26:44  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: I've created this wiki page based on our discussion earlier: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Storytelling+Tool+update+process
2019-03-29T19:31:59  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss. i made a little adjustment at (6)
2019-03-29T19:34:09  <gmoss> thanks cindyli :)
2019-03-29T19:45:47  <cindyli> gmoss, michelled, the staging site looks good to me. let me know when it's ok to merge dev into prod. thanks
2019-03-29T19:46:47  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: I ran the browser tests for the staging site in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE11 with only IE11 bugging out (it doesn't really work in that browser anyway, this is something we're aware of). I also ran the CI backup job
2019-03-29T19:47:09  <gmoss> alanharnum: it looks like the storytelling backup job removed the previous backup, which was not expected
2019-03-29T19:47:23  <gmoss> alanharnum: I can send you a link to the console output if you like
2019-03-29T19:49:50  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: I think I'm comfortable with merging this into prod, or at least as comfortable as I should reasonably be ;)
2019-03-29T19:51:25  <cindyli> gmoss: hope today's back up is till there ;)
2019-03-29T19:51:35  <cindyli> still
2019-03-29T19:52:05  <gmoss> "Backed up to /srv/...." so it says it is haha.. i have no way of checking

2019-03-29T19:59:10  <cindyli> ok, merging into production branch
2019-03-29T19:59:38  <gmoss> cindyli: okay! alanharnum2 I've opened a PR to update the prod site CI to point to the correct repo
2019-03-29T20:00:33  <cindyli> done
2019-03-29T20:01:14  <cindyli> i guess the prod site won't be updated until your PR is merged, gmoss?
2019-03-29T20:01:47  <gmoss> cindyli: that's right
2019-03-29T20:02:01  <cindyli> ok. thanks.
2019-03-29T20:02:05  <gmoss> since the prod site in the server repo points to a particular commit of the UI repo
2019-03-29T20:02:20  <cindyli> ah interesting
2019-03-29T20:04:20  <alanharnum2> gmoss: I can merge that now or wait until Monday, depending on your read on the safety of doing so
2019-03-29T20:04:52  <gmoss> alanharnum2: I'm feeling lucky :) before you do, though, would you be able to check the server backup files just to make sure they exist?
2019-03-29T20:05:14  <gmoss> I'm wearing my metaphorical cowboy hat today
2019-03-29T20:06:30  <alanharnum2> gmoss: checking now - btw to your earlier question, removing one older backup would be expected for the script - it retains the newest five backups only
2019-03-29T20:07:05  <gmoss> alanharnum2: I figured since the job had only been run twice, I would expect zero files to be removed this time. it looks like it removed the previous backup file
2019-03-29T20:07:40  <alanharnum2> gmoss: that would be based on the assumption that I removed all the testing backups that got made when I was making sure the script worked, which I did not :)
2019-03-29T20:07:45  <gmoss> alanharnum2: but I was basing this on the timestamp. there must be files in there not associated with the CI job
2019-03-29T20:07:46  <gmoss> yes
2019-03-29T20:07:47  <gmoss> that :)
2019-03-29T20:07:59  <gmoss> okay good haha
2019-03-29T20:08:19  <gmoss> in that case, I feel confident in the process. cindyli, michelled: any thoughts?
2019-03-29T20:08:54  <michelled> gmoss: I wasn't folowing - has the backup been made?
2019-03-29T20:09:04  <gmoss> michelled: to the best of my knowledge, yes
2019-03-29T20:09:15  <michelled> ok then I feel good with doing the merge
2019-03-29T20:09:36  <alanharnum2> gmoss: there's five backups currently - the one removed was the oldest one
2019-03-29T20:09:43  <gmoss> alanharnum2: perfect
2019-03-29T20:11:06  <alanharnum2> they're a bit cryptic to read, but the files themselves are timestamped (yearmonthday-hourminutesecond) btw
2019-03-29T20:11:37  <gmoss> alanharnum2: i did notice that, but I admit I was not willing to convert the timestamp from server time (UTC?) to EDT
2019-03-29T20:11:57  <alanharnum2> gmoss: merged
2019-03-29T20:12:47  <gmoss> @alanharnum2: thanks! I think I will need to run the job manually to update the deployed server
2019-03-29T20:12:53  <alanharnum2> Jenkins jobs have updated successfully, should now be able to run a deploy manually to deploy the new code
2019-03-29T20:13:02  <alanharnum2> gmoss: that's correct
