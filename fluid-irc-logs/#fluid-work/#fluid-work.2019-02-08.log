2019-02-08T16:45:18  <clown> fluid-everyone:  I received a security message from github about a known low severtiy vulnerability in lodash as used by the fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles, with a recommended fix.
2019-02-08T16:45:39  <clown> Did anyone else receive such a message?
2019-02-08T16:46:19  <clown> I know nothing about the "grunt-modules" repository.  I suspect this is something Justin would handle, but he is away.
2019-02-08T16:46:36  <clown> Any else care to look into it?
2019-02-08T17:03:58  <bryan_> clown: what is the version of lodash, and what is the recommended fix?
2019-02-08T17:15:13  <clown> bryan_, "security vulnerability detected in lodash < 4.17.11 … update suggested: lodash ~> 4.17.11."
2019-02-08T17:17:35  <bryan_> Ah then that's an easy one, just update package.json to require 4.17.11

2019-02-08T17:18:11  <clown> bryan_, I'm looking for a maintainer of that repository to make the change.
2019-02-08T17:19:00  <cindyli> gmoss, michelle, here comes the bad news: i don't have push access to fluid-project/SJRK repos
2019-02-08T17:19:54  <gmoss> cindyli: dang... I guess we need to find someone who does and is willing to help us out
2019-02-08T17:20:36  <cindyli> simonjb is not working today. I don't know who else has push access
2019-02-08T17:20:47  <bryan_> In the movies someone would just hack in and make the change
2019-02-08T17:21:52  <jhernandez> clown: maybe you can just provide a pr with the updated lodash ref?
2019-02-08T17:23:16  <cindyli> haha, LOVE the freedom in movies.
2019-02-08T17:23:31  <bryan_> Who could approve such a PR?
2019-02-08T17:24:59  <bryan_> The vulnerability sounds fairly benign (regex DOS and prototype pollution). Actually typing that out sounds more severe
2019-02-08T17:25:10  <clown> jhernandez, bryan_:  good idea, although it will be low priority for me.  and approval would come from one of the maintainers of that repo who has push access, and know what that repo is all about.
2019-02-08T17:26:16  <clown> <sarcasm>prototype pollution??  Oh nOOOO!!!</sarcasm>
2019-02-08T17:27:00  <bryan_> "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The functions merge, mergeWith, and defaultsDeep could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype."
2019-02-08T17:27:14  <bryan_> Basically the worst parts of the bible
2019-02-08T17:27:48  <jhernandez> fluid-modulefiles, contributors: jobara, cindyli and amb26 (a.k.a. Bosmon)
2019-02-08T17:27:51  <bryan_> I'll do the PR and submit it
2019-02-08T17:27:55  <jhernandez> clown: ^
2019-02-08T17:28:10  <clown> either one of the seven deadly sins or the plagues of Egypt
2019-02-08T17:28:19  <clown> thanks bryan_!
2019-02-08T17:29:01  <clown> jhernandez:  yes, I saw the contributors, and asked Cindy yesterday, but she said she didn't have push access.  Maybe Bosmon does.
2019-02-08T17:29:26  <clown> and jobara is away until July.
2019-02-08T17:31:34  <jhernandez> clown: yeah, looks like Bosmon is the last resort
2019-02-08T17:31:59  <Bosmon> clown, sure
2019-02-08T17:32:26  <Bosmon> In practice, this particular class of vulnerability isn't very important
2019-02-08T17:32:33  <Bosmon> Since they are exposed only at dev time
2019-02-08T17:32:46  <Bosmon> We've got several, for example, inherited through merely continuing to use grunt at all
2019-02-08T17:32:53  <Bosmon> But by all means do submit the pull!
2019-02-08T17:33:20  <clown> Thanks Bosmon.
2019-02-08T17:33:39  <clown> bryan_:  are you doing the pull?  Just make sure.
2019-02-08T17:33:53  <clown> and thanks again if you are.
2019-02-08T17:33:56  <bryan_> I volunteer as tribute! Yes I'll do it

2019-02-08T17:56:22  <colinclark> so anyone who is currently a Fluid committer should be able to administer those two repositories

2019-02-08T18:16:34  <clown> sgithens:  if it helps, the package.json for gpii-universal does not mention lodash, but universal does use it
2019-02-08T18:16:48  <clown> package.json does not mention grunt-modules either.
2019-02-08T18:18:40  <sgithens> clown: cool thanks.  The output from my `npm list lodash` makes it look like all the rest of the deps are already updgraded
2019-02-08T18:18:41  <clown> maybe there is some dependant dependency somewhere.  that is, installing, e.g., infusion causes lodash to be loaded.
2019-02-08T18:19:03  <clown> no problem, sgithens
2019-02-08T18:19:21  <sgithens> oh, I guess I do see a couple older ones in here

2019-02-08T20:20:30  <gmoss> cindyli michelled: I've moved all of my PRs for both the UI and server projects to point to the new stories-floe-dev branches. GitHub made it surprisingly easy to do in a way that preserves existing review. There's still one more PR from simonjb that I wasn't able to edit: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling-server/pull/12
2019-02-08T20:21:12  <cindyli> great. thanks, gmoss
2019-02-08T20:21:26  <gmoss> cindyli: are you able to edit the base branch for that PR?
2019-02-08T20:21:32  <gmoss> also yw!
2019-02-08T20:21:41  <michelled> that's cool that you were able to preserve the review
2019-02-08T20:21:57  <gmoss> yeah I was pleasantly surprised
2019-02-08T20:25:05  <cindyli> gmoss: i did a refetch of your repo and nothing new coming up, which is not surprising. i don't think there's edit needed at my end. I hope being careful to merge pulls into the correct branch is enough
2019-02-08T20:26:36  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm not sure I understand. I haven't made a new branch for simonjb's PR, not yet anyway. I was hoping someone with access could make the same operation through GitHub to change the branch the PR is being merged into
2019-02-08T20:27:00  <cindyli> oh, i see
2019-02-08T20:27:07  <gmoss> if it's simpler, I can make the same fix and open my own PR, though
2019-02-08T20:28:32  <cindyli> gmoss: i've change the base branch of simon's PR
2019-02-08T20:28:41  <cindyli> changed
2019-02-08T20:29:04  <gmoss> cindyli: perfect! thanks :)
