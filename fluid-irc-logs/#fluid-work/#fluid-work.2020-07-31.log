2020-07-31T14:14:35  <Uttara> cindyli, Teddy__ : I have added the necessary things to the comments section in figma. Please have a look
2020-07-31T14:14:56  <cindyli1> thanks, Uttara. having a look..
2020-07-31T14:17:12  <cindyli1> Uttara: can you update the side menu on Initiatives page
2020-07-31T14:17:34  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-07-31T14:19:47  <cindyli> Uttara: what's the difference between the first and the second slides?
2020-07-31T14:21:29  <cindyli> a few other things, Uttara:
2020-07-31T14:22:28  <cindyli> 1. the "required" indicator for the name and comment fields are not same across the last 3 slides. the one in the middle has the star sign and "Required" text while other two only have the start sign;
2020-07-31T14:23:49  <cindyli> 2. if we do show the text "required" in red, please think about how this text should look like when UIO contrast theme is applied. most of those themes only have 1 text color and 1 background color;
2020-07-31T14:25:08  <Uttara> cindyli: the 2nd page is the hover style , I will add the "required" text styling for UIO inside the style guide section
2020-07-31T14:25:39  <cindyli> thanks, Uttara
2020-07-31T14:26:02  <cindyli> 3. If a user submits a post with "name" or/and "comment" fields empty, how should the error message look like
2020-07-31T14:26:18  <Uttara> cindyli: the"required" text only appears if you enter a blank comment. Where as the * sign always remains constant
2020-07-31T14:27:05  <Uttara> cindyli: that would be the error message. You will only be able to see "required" if you submit a blank comment
2020-07-31T14:27:21  <cindyli> i see. Uttara. could you add this explanation to that slide too. thanks
2020-07-31T14:27:43  <Uttara> cindyli: just did
2020-07-31T14:28:00  <cindyli> thanks, Uttara. btw, typo on that slide: black -> blank
2020-07-31T14:29:07  <cindyli> Uttara: one last question, the last slide shows, when a user submits a comment, will his comment be visible to himself?
2020-07-31T14:29:48  <Uttara> cindyli: I added that to the notes.
2020-07-31T14:30:09  <cindyli> i think what we discussed yesterday was, it will be visible to himself on that page, but the explanation will tell him his post will not be visible out of that page
2020-07-31T14:31:09  <Uttara> cindyli: okay we can keep it in black , let me change that
2020-07-31T14:31:34  <cindyli> sorry, Uttara, keep what in black?
2020-07-31T14:32:38  <Uttara> @cindyli: give me a minute, just changing things in figma
2020-07-31T14:34:36  <Uttara> @cindyli: speaking with Lisa. I will get back to you
2020-07-31T15:41:34  <raunak>  (cindyli ) i fixed #354 issue  can you review ??? ----------- https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/354
2020-07-31T15:46:52  <colinclark> raunak: Could we talk for a few minutes?
2020-07-31T15:49:03  <raunak> ya sure
2020-07-31T15:49:25  <colinclark> So I’m concerned about the approach you’ve been taking to contributing to our community
2020-07-31T15:50:14  <colinclark> Can I ask, first, why you’re interested in contributing to our We Count project in particular?
2020-07-31T15:53:15  <raunak> in this issue #354  i fixed with   white-space:nonwrap;
2020-07-31T15:53:34  <colinclark> raunak: That wasn’t my question
2020-07-31T15:54:02  <colinclark> I’m asking about your interests; why in particular are you motivated to work on We Count?
2020-07-31T15:54:39  <colinclark> I’d like to get a better idea about your background, motivations, and interests in contributing to our community
2020-07-31T15:57:10  <raunak> i am interested in this project because this project is similar to my stack and i can  understand the codebase of this project
2020-07-31T15:57:25  <colinclark> What’s your stack?
2020-07-31T15:58:42  <raunak> like i am interested in nodejs ,express and mongodb with html , css and javascript and i am a full stack developer
2020-07-31T15:59:24  <colinclark> That’s great!
2020-07-31T15:59:29  <colinclark> My next question is to ask if you’ve spent any time familiarizing yourself with the We Count project, its goals, and priorities?
2020-07-31T16:01:26  <raunak> i can make a html pages or styling the pages of the we count project
2020-07-31T16:02:19  <colinclark> That also wasn’t my question, raunak :)
2020-07-31T16:07:35  <colinclark> raunak: Are you still there?
2020-07-31T16:09:55  <raunak> i cannot get your question
2020-07-31T16:10:03  <colinclark> Ok, no problem
2020-07-31T16:10:15  <colinclark> What I’m asking about is whether you’ve spent any time familiarizing yourself with the project itself
2020-07-31T16:10:26  <colinclark> why we’re doing it, what our goals are, and how we work
2020-07-31T16:10:36  <colinclark> but it sounds like the answer is “not yet”
2020-07-31T16:10:47  <colinclark> So raunak, I need to be honest here, your contributions haven’t been very effective so far
2020-07-31T16:11:41  <colinclark> And I think there are probably some skills you should learn about before diving too much into contributing
2020-07-31T16:12:12  <colinclark> I wonder if you’ve had a chance to closely read this documentation from the Google Summer of Code program? https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/
2020-07-31T16:12:25  <colinclark> It has a lot of helpful advice about how to get to know a new open source community, and how to communicate
2020-07-31T16:13:16  <colinclark> Right now, your contributions aren’t very helpful, and yet it’s taken our team a lot of time to respond to them
2020-07-31T16:13:46  <colinclark> I know that you’re clearly looking to make some contributions and improve your portfolio of open source work, but generally quick, one-line fixes aren’t going to be very useful
2020-07-31T16:14:29  <colinclark> and I think cindyli has pointed out to you several times how there is an etiquette to learning about a project, communicating effectively, and taking the time to dig deeper into a problem is crucial for an effective contribution
2020-07-31T16:15:08  <colinclark> So far, your pull requests seem to have been hastily assembled without enough considerations of what will appropriately fix the issue
2020-07-31T16:15:34  <colinclark> and you’ve been demanding a lot of time from contributors to respond to your requests
2020-07-31T16:15:51  <colinclark> seemingly without having taken the time yourself to look iinto the issues more closely on your own
2020-07-31T16:16:13  <colinclark> raunak: Do you understand my feedback here?
2020-07-31T16:24:12  <colinclark> raunak: Are you still there?
2020-07-31T16:48:40  <raunak> i am a  student and beginner in this field i can do  easliy task in like here are my some pr which is merged in fossaisa.org
2020-07-31T16:49:07  <raunak> here are i providing you my pr links you can viewed it

2020-07-31T16:49:18  <raunak> https://github.com/fossasia/fossasia.org/pull/743

2020-07-31T16:49:53  <raunak> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/5DczONqx/fossaisa.org%20%2314.PNG
2020-07-31T16:50:39  <colinclark> Hi raunak, yes I see those contributions
2020-07-31T16:50:49  <raunak> i can do easy task  because right now i am a beginner
2020-07-31T16:51:06  <colinclark> raunak: I understand you’re a beginner, yes
2020-07-31T16:51:24  <colinclark> Right now, I feel that you’d be best served doing a few things before contributing:
2020-07-31T16:51:32  <raunak> if you guide me how i apporach to issue i can easly fixed   it
2020-07-31T16:51:43  <colinclark> 1. Carefully read Google Summer of Code’s guidelines, which I linked to above
2020-07-31T16:51:56  <colinclark> 2. Read our own advice about how to get involved: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-07-31T16:52:21  <colinclark> 3. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the We Count team’s process—watch and listen before making fixes
2020-07-31T16:52:58  <colinclark> 4. Be respectful of our contributor’s time, and listen to them when they provide you with feedback—don’t just demand their time over and over again
2020-07-31T16:53:50  <colinclark> 5. Take the time to understand an issue in depth before making simple one-line fixes that might not fully solve the problem
2020-07-31T16:53:56  <colinclark> raunak: Does this make sense?
2020-07-31T16:59:56  <raunak> now i always listen to the mentors and ask them how i approach to fixed this issue
2020-07-31T17:00:42  <raunak> if anyone can guide me i can easly solve any bug or issue
2020-07-31T17:03:17  <raunak> i always  respect my mentors and coach
2020-07-31T17:06:21  <dmahajan980> raunak: It's not just about solving a bug/issue. Part of contributing is about understanding how the community works, their values, maintaining the communication etiquette, and respecting other members' time. And as colinclark said, you should try acknowledging these first (refer to the links he attached).
2020-07-31T17:06:52  <colinclark> that’s a great point, thanks dmahajan980
2020-07-31T17:07:25  <raunak> sure
2020-07-31T17:07:30  <dmahajan980> You're welcome colinclark.
2020-07-31T17:10:17  <dmahajan980> raunak: I think colinclark has left you good feedback. You should spend some time there and ask if you still have some doubts.
2020-07-31T17:16:57  <raunak> from now i fixed my mistake
2020-07-31T17:17:04  <raunak> thanks for feedback
2020-07-31T17:28:41  <cindyli> hi Bosmon, i just sent you invites to WeCount tech check in meetings every Monday and Thursday. but next Monday is a public holiday in Canada so that meeting is cancelled
2020-07-31T17:34:20  <colinclark> Thanks, raunak
2020-07-31T17:34:43  <colinclark> cindyli: Just in case, and to be way too official sounding…
2020-07-31T17:34:58  <colinclark> Bosmon can’t officially start working with us until the subaward with RtF-I gets signed
2020-07-31T17:35:01  <colinclark> which we’re really close to
2020-07-31T17:35:09  <colinclark> probably sometime next week, definitely no later than Aug 15
2020-07-31T17:35:34  <colinclark> (but I have a feeling he might nonetheless like to drop by some team meetings on his own time before then)
2020-07-31T17:43:51  <cindyli> ah ha. i see. thanks for the information, colinclark
2020-07-31T17:44:15  <colinclark> no problem
2020-07-31T17:44:22  <colinclark> and again, sorry to be all official sounding :)
2020-07-31T18:02:28  <gmoss> cindyli: done all my post-deploy testing, things look great: all the stories are there and working, editor bugs that were solved seem to be gone
2020-07-31T18:02:53  <cindyli> awesome. thanks for all the testing, gmoss
2020-07-31T18:03:14  <gmoss> all in a day's work :) thanks for pushing the release out!
2020-07-31T19:18:28  <Uttara> cindyli: just spoke to Lisa, I have made the necessary changes.
2020-07-31T19:18:50  <cindyli> great. thanks, Uttara
2020-07-31T19:32:43  <cindyli> Uttara: i wonder if it's ok to switch the position of "Initiatives" and "Inclusion Challenges" on the top navigation bar?
2020-07-31T19:33:13  <cindyli> the reason is, the "Initiatives" will no longer be fetched from wordpress
2020-07-31T19:33:31  <Uttara> @cindyli: yes, I dont think thats a problem
2020-07-31T19:33:40  <cindyli> cool. thanks, Uttara
2020-07-31T20:34:47  <colinclark> well folks, i hope you have a nice long weekend
2020-07-31T20:34:55  <colinclark> i think i’ll go sailing soon :)
2020-07-31T20:35:03  <danielcho> Have fun Colin :)
2020-07-31T20:35:09  <danielcho> and have a nice long weekend!
2020-07-31T20:35:17  <colinclark> you too danielcho!
