2020-06-03T13:43:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. I had a thought over the weekend related to performance of Infusion. It might be something you've already thought about, and not sure the feasibility. I'm wondering if we'd be able to have a sort of "compilation" option/setting that could be run as part of the build process and/or by a consumer of Infusion before deploying their own code. One thing that it could do would be to pre-merge all of the
2020-06-03T13:43:36  <Justin_o> static grade definitions within a particular component/grade.
2020-06-03T13:54:01  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the "framework after the next" will indeed facilitate just that
2020-06-03T13:54:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah cool, is that Infusion v4?
2020-06-03T13:54:52  <Bosmon> Justin_o - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5304
2020-06-03T13:55:02  <Bosmon> It's now a rather out-of-date description but the basic plan is still valid
2020-06-03T13:55:12  <Bosmon> Yes, I guess it will be v4
2020-06-03T13:55:25  <Justin_o> you're a full 6 years ahead of me
2020-06-03T14:16:27  <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have time to review this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/993?
2020-06-03T14:18:19  <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2020-06-03T14:18:36  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2020-06-03T14:18:39  <cindyli> np
2020-06-03T15:00:41  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: for infusion/kettle, we have been running with GitHub Actions for more than a month now... I feel like it's time disable the webhook that triggers builds in Jenkins. Any concerns? Has our experience so far been mostly positive?

2020-06-03T16:29:02  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I haven't noticed any issues with the GitHub Actions
2020-06-03T16:29:16  <Justin_o> jhernandez: this is the error I'm getting
2020-06-03T16:29:52  <Justin_o> 'electron' is not recognized as an internal or external command
2020-06-03T16:30:08  <Justin_o> I'll try to get the rest of message in a minute once I figure out how to copy out of the vm
2020-06-03T16:32:47  <Justin_o> Sorry, I couldn't copy and paste the error message out of the VM, so here's a screen shot https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/E54uVtg6/gpii-app%20error.png

2020-06-03T16:37:53  <dogeman> gmoss jhung Justin_o did you start looking at old standing PRs in floe and fluid repos?
2020-06-03T16:40:15  <Justin_o> dogeman: sorry, I haven't had a chance. not sure about the others
2020-06-03T16:43:51  <jhernandez> Justin_o: hmmm
2020-06-03T16:44:06  <jhernandez> 1st, can you try running it from V:?
2020-06-03T16:44:12  <jhernandez> this is cd v:
2020-06-03T16:44:33  <jhernandez> and try running npm run dev again
2020-06-03T16:45:12  <jhernandez> if it still complains about electron, I'd say npm install failed
2020-06-03T16:45:45  <gmoss> dogeman: likewise, I also haven't taken a look yet. I was planning to do so tomorrow
2020-06-03T16:46:48  <dogeman> alright
2020-06-03T16:50:30  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I'm in the middle of rebuilding the VM again, but will try your suggestion when it's finished
2020-06-03T16:59:28  <jhernandez> Justin_o: ok ok
2020-06-03T16:59:31  <jhernandez> let me know how it goes
2020-06-03T17:02:01  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks, sorry, taking a long time to rebuild the VM

2020-06-03T18:51:19  <dmahajan980> Hi everyone! I have been recently looking into the project structure of UIO+ Chrome Extension and I was wondering about how it uses node_modules or the infusion npm package without bundling? I wanted to get an idea about it as the same strategy could be used in the gamepad-navigator.
2020-06-03T19:27:25  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: hello
2020-06-03T19:28:24  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: if you aren't you'll probably want to look at this repo https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus
2020-06-03T19:28:46  <Justin_o> the one from the GPII org is being restricted to consume it, which will make the structure even more different.
2020-06-03T19:29:33  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: so in short we use grunt to copy the files to the correct place. https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L57-L73
2020-06-03T19:39:00  <dmahajan980> Hi @Justin_o, thanks for sharing it. I was checking the particular lines in the gruntfile which copies all those files. What I'm confused with is that the gruntfile copies those files into the `dist` folder while the `manifest.json` file is trying to access those from the `src` folder itself. Are the files from the `src` folder also copied into the `dist` folder?
2020-06-03T19:42:57  <dmahajan980> Sorry, I just checked the grunt task that copies the files from the `src` folder as well. It was above the same task and I didn't see it earlier.
2020-06-03T19:43:20  <dmahajan980> Thanks again @Justin_o
2020-06-03T19:44:02  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: no problem, that's not the only way to set things up, but it's how I've sorted things there for now.
2020-06-03T19:45:30  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: in the open-in-same-tab extension, we copy third party files to a lib directory https://github.com/GPII/gpii-open-same-tab-extension/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
2020-06-03T19:46:33  <Justin_o> in this case we aren't using infusion, but you could consider doing something similar. Note that the lib directory is added to the gitignore because we don't want to commit it. Also there is a prepare script to ensure that the third party dependencies are copied on npm install https://github.com/GPII/gpii-open-same-tab-extension/blob/master/package.json#L6
2020-06-03T19:51:40  <dmahajan980> Thanks for sharing it @Justin_o. I'll go through it.
2020-06-03T19:53:14  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: no problem, good luck.. let me know if you have any more questions or if you find better solutions
2020-06-03T19:54:39  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: I was looking into this before and someone had suggested to use Webpack - https://stackoverflow.com/a/43684769/11736311
2020-06-03T19:54:58  <dmahajan980> But I wasn't really sure if the community uses Webpack
2020-06-03T19:56:15  <dmahajan980> Here's one extension specified by the same user: https://github.com/lusakasa/saka-key
2020-06-03T19:57:11  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: there are a few projects that make use of it, but infusion needs to be loaded statically, so not sure how much weback would help in this case.
2020-06-03T19:58:17  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: you can talk to the-t-in-rtf, but it might be easier to start with a more basic approach and see over time if you need something more extensive like webpack or other bundler
2020-06-03T20:01:55  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: I think I should start off with the similar approach and then evaluate Webpack for the project, as you said.
2020-06-03T20:05:05  <Justin_o> sounds good
2020-06-03T21:38:55  *** christopher is now known as Guest65744
2020-06-03T22:38:40  <dogeman> dmahajan980 you can also have a look at the most recent PRs in floe and fluid project. The PRs too have used a similar process for use of infusion by copying files into the dist directory from src directory using 11ty though.
