2020-06-16T11:16:22  <gtirloni> nice
2020-06-16T11:34:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm having serious issues with Skype, I assume we're in room 2 or something?
2020-06-16T11:34:50  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez? @Bosmon? @sgithens ?
2020-06-16T11:35:06  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Javi is trying to open the room
2020-06-16T11:35:22  <sgithens> but having difficulties with the gotomeeting
2020-06-16T11:41:51  <jhernandez> the internet is broken today
2020-06-16T11:41:57  <jhernandez> ?
2020-06-16T11:43:15  <the-t-in-rtf> let's try room 3 then
2020-06-16T11:44:19  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I see
2020-06-16T11:44:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I really don't want to attend from my phone
2020-06-16T11:44:43  <the-t-in-rtf> both rooms are requiring gregg's email verification now, which is awesome
2020-06-16T11:44:46  <the-t-in-rtf> google meet?
2020-06-16T11:44:47  <the-t-in-rtf> slack?
2020-06-16T11:44:48  <the-t-in-rtf> something
2020-06-16T11:45:07  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: can't you use web-based skype?
2020-06-16T11:45:16  <the-t-in-rtf> let me see
2020-06-16T11:45:22  <jhernandez> web.skype.com
2020-06-16T11:45:24  <jhernandez> :P
2020-06-16T12:31:47  <Justin_o> gtirloni: did you get the issue with the archived repos that are deployed sorted out? Is there anything you needed from me for that?
2020-06-16T12:34:26  <gtirloni> Justin_o: not yet, I don't have permission to unarchive them. Would you be able to do that?
2020-06-16T12:35:24  <Justin_o> gtirloni: sure, so these repos are only going to have changes related to deployment.
2020-06-16T12:35:33  <Justin_o> I'm just trying to think of how best to update the description.
2020-06-16T12:35:43  <gtirloni> yeah, only deployment
2020-06-16T12:41:42  <Justin_o> gtirloni: could you please review the my issue tracker sheet and note any repos that I've asked to archive, if they fall into a similar category as these.
2020-06-16T12:41:45  <Justin_o> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xKLW8rQC-JN-TI9sL0ojeLXNRoqk4DfPwFd51jAuRJo/edit#gid=1186936983
2020-06-16T12:41:54  <Justin_o> that way I don't accidentally archive it on you
2020-06-16T12:42:17  <gtirloni> will do, thanks!
2020-06-16T12:43:30  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-06-16T12:47:31  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I've unarchived https://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer
2020-06-16T12:47:51  <Justin_o> however, I just noticed that https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors is in the GPII GitHub org.
2020-06-16T12:47:58  <gtirloni> yeah
2020-06-16T12:48:06  <Justin_o> I don't have access to that, you could talk to Bosmon maybe.
2020-06-16T12:48:18  <gtirloni> ok, thanks for checking
2020-06-16T12:48:20  <Justin_o> However, I guess we can guarantee that it will stick around
2020-06-16T12:48:34  <Justin_o> can't
2020-06-16T12:49:40  <Justin_o> and you'd need to have someone from that community handle your PRs. I wonder if this is something we should handle differently. We could fork it into the fluid-project space
2020-06-16T12:49:46  <Justin_o> gtirloni: ^
2020-06-16T12:50:27  <gtirloni> forking seems fine, it's only for the builds website. btw, we should have metrics about access to builds website soon
2020-06-16T12:50:34  <Justin_o> colinclark: ^ do yo have a thought on what's best to do with that repo?
2020-06-16T12:52:00  <Justin_o> gtirloni: that's great thanks.. I wonder if there are metrics that we want to make more public and if so, if there is a way for us to do that easily.
2020-06-16T13:02:22  <gtirloni> hmm you mean from Matomo?
2020-06-16T13:02:37  <gtirloni> it supports anonymous users if we want to make things more public
2020-06-16T13:03:12  <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay thanks, not sure if there is anything, was just curious.
2020-06-16T13:03:32  <gtirloni> you should have an user at https://analytics.inclusivedesign.ca
2020-06-16T13:03:46  <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, I'm just looking at things now. Thanks
2020-06-16T13:03:50  <gtirloni> cool :)
2020-06-16T13:07:39  <Justin_o> achecker.ca is by far the most popular site
2020-06-16T13:31:31  <colinclark> Justin_o: We should have a GPII committer migrate it to the Fluid org
2020-06-16T13:31:49  <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, that seems reasonable, I'll delete the fork
2020-06-16T13:31:55  <colinclark> I think we’ll probably be taking on some other repositories like that too
2020-06-16T13:32:13  <Justin_o> colinclark: makes sense
2020-06-16T13:32:14  <colinclark> we might want to give this a different name though, when we migrate it
2020-06-16T13:32:21  <Justin_o> colinclark: I agree
2020-06-16T13:32:38  <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: are either of you able to migrate a repo from GPII to fluid-project?
2020-06-16T13:32:43  <colinclark> sorry to make extra work for you, Justin_o
2020-06-16T13:32:59  <Justin_o> colinclark: no worries, I was expecting to have to do some cleanup on it at some point
2020-06-16T13:33:23  <clown> Good morning Justin_o:  by "able" do you mean, "have the relevant permissions"?
2020-06-16T13:33:33  <clown> If so, I think so.
2020-06-16T13:33:36  <cindyli> Justin_o: i don't know if I have the permission, but I can give a try
2020-06-16T13:34:05  <clown> Would you know the relevant git commands?
2020-06-16T13:34:36  <Justin_o> clown, cindyli: yes permissions. You basically just go the repo https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors
2020-06-16T13:34:50  <Justin_o> click on the settings tab, and scroll to the danger zone and transfer ownership
2020-06-16T13:34:57  <clown> I think I have "committer emeritus" for the fluid-project.
2020-06-16T13:35:13  <Justin_o> clown, cindyli: I can handle the repo renaming once its in the fluid-project space
2020-06-16T13:35:26  <Justin_o> clown: hmm.. let me see
2020-06-16T13:36:08  <Justin_o> clown: you still have regular maintainer privileges
2020-06-16T13:36:40  <clown> I don't know if this matters, but when I go to that repo, it says near the top:  "This repository has been archived by the owner. It is now read-only. "
2020-06-16T13:37:16  <Justin_o> clown: that's partly why we need to take it over :) but in terms of matter, you might have to unarchive it first, I'm not sure.
2020-06-16T13:37:33  <Justin_o> but that's done in the same general area of the settings
2020-06-16T13:38:14  <clown> I don't see a "settings" tab.  That might be because I don't have the authority.  Or, I'm looking in the wrong place.
2020-06-16T13:38:40  <colinclark> I’ll take a look
2020-06-16T13:38:44  <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2020-06-16T13:38:52  <Justin_o> clown: could be you don't have access
2020-06-16T13:39:13  <clown> Justin_o:  where would it be if I did have access?
2020-06-16T13:39:18  <colinclark> done
2020-06-16T13:40:01  <colinclark> Justin_o: I’m particularly keen to take on some of the-t-in-rtf’s libraries that we use a lot
2020-06-16T13:40:08  <Justin_o> clown: thanks for looking, it would be at the far right of the set of tabs for things like "Code" "Pull Requests" and etc.
2020-06-16T13:40:41  <colinclark> like, let’s call them infusion-handlebars, infusion-binder, and infusion-express :)
2020-06-16T13:40:50  <gtirloni> lol
2020-06-16T13:41:04  <clown> Okay, I don't see a "settings" tab.  I have:  Code, Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, and Insights
2020-06-16T13:41:09  <gtirloni> just renamed the GPII org too :P
2020-06-16T13:41:10  <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, it would make sense to pull some of those repos in
2020-06-16T13:41:17  <gtirloni> *rename!
2020-06-16T13:41:28  <colinclark> :)
2020-06-16T13:41:42  <clown> Okay Justin_o — glad you got it started with colinclark's help.  Back to work.
2020-06-16T13:41:44  <Justin_o> clown: it would have been immediately to the right of "insights"
2020-06-16T13:42:05  <clown> yes, nothing to the right of "Insights".
2020-06-16T13:42:11  <clown> for me
2020-06-16T13:42:32  <Justin_o> clown: thanks, also I updated my PR for UIO for Morphic related to GPII-4218. It would be a big difference but it fires an event when it receives the response from the server.. although it doesn't do anything with it
2020-06-16T13:43:34  <clown> I noticed your changes this morning.  I have a couple of other cleanups on my end to do first; then I'll get your latest changes and see if anything breaks.
2020-06-16T13:44:03  <Justin_o> colinclark:  any suggestions for a new name for this repo, I forgot it had PCP and PMT in it as well. https://github.com/fluid-project/prefsEditors
2020-06-16T13:45:04  <colinclark> something with the word “prototypes” in it? :)
2020-06-16T13:45:32  <colinclark> I’m trying to remember...
2020-06-16T13:45:46  <colinclark> so it’s got the PGA-era exploration tool in it
2020-06-16T13:46:05  <colinclark> and then is it the Cloud4All era PCP/PMT?
2020-06-16T13:46:20  <colinclark> looks like it
2020-06-16T13:46:52  <colinclark> yeah, it’d call it something like preferences-editor-prototypes
2020-06-16T13:47:01  <Justin_o> looks like it, I thought first discovery would be here, but I guess that's somewhere else
2020-06-16T13:47:06  <colinclark> yup
2020-06-16T13:48:00  <colinclark> It’s clearly still “archive”-level stuff for us
2020-06-16T13:48:29  <colinclark> but at least this way we don’t have to bug the Morphic team for fixes like the one gtirloni is doing, and we can demo it as needed
2020-06-16T13:48:48  <colinclark> it’s good to keep a record of the “AccessForAll approach” as Jutta calls it
2020-06-16T13:51:20  <Justin_o> yes, that all makes sense..
2020-06-16T14:06:35  <Justin_o> colinclark: here are some thoughts for the name of the repo: "prefsEditors-prototypes", "prefsEditor-explorations", "gpii-prefsEditors", or instead of "prefsEditors" you can "preference-editing-exploration" and etc.
2020-06-16T14:07:01  <colinclark> I think “exploration” will be confusing since there is an exploration tool in there :)
2020-06-16T14:07:08  <colinclark> the first one seems fine to me
2020-06-16T14:07:21  <colinclark> prefs-editors-prototypes
2020-06-16T14:07:48  <Justin_o> lets go with that, thanks
2020-06-16T14:16:06  <colinclark> cool
2020-06-16T14:16:06  <colinclark> by the way, Justin_o, i don’t mind wrt to kebab vs. camel case
2020-06-16T14:16:06  <colinclark> i just like the kebabs
2020-06-16T14:18:17  <Justin_o> cindyli, gtirloni: will a docker container be added for the wecount site.. I'm wondering if that will affect how the Lighthouse CI integration should work.
2020-06-16T14:19:25  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I need to catch on how we're doing headless WordPress but I'd say, yes. I haven't heard about Lighthouse CI before
2020-06-16T14:19:54  <Justin_o> gtirloni: this is the issue I'm working on https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/267
2020-06-16T14:20:47  <gtirloni> i think it shouldn't affect that
2020-06-16T14:20:52  <Justin_o> there are a bunch of links there that should help. Basically I'm trying to integrate the Lighthouse auditor tool into the GitHub Actions.
2020-06-16T14:22:27  <Justin_o> gtirloni: right now I'm running a build and then pointing at the static files.. getting about 1/2 the performance score as running Lighthouse from the Chrome Dev tools against the we count dev site though.. so I'm not sure if there is a configuration issue, if it has something do with the way the integrated Lighthouse server is serving the static files or something else
2020-06-16T14:23:10  <Justin_o> gtirloni: if it turns out we start using/needing lighthouse more what are your thoughts on deploying our own server for it. https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#the-lighthouse-ci-server
2020-06-16T14:23:39  <Justin_o> particularly it would help us to track changes in the scores over time and identify regressions
2020-06-16T16:16:44  <Bosmon> I never knew they were kebabs
2020-06-16T16:26:14  <michelled> you're making me hungry
2020-06-16T16:26:37  <michelled> I made these delicious paneer tikka kebabs on the weekend and they got over too quickly ;)
2020-06-16T16:26:44  <colinclark> omg
2020-06-16T16:26:49  <colinclark> that sounds sooooo delicious
2020-06-16T16:27:21  <michelled> it's a good use of the green egg :D
2020-06-16T16:28:55  <gtirloni> Justin_o: thanks, I'll check lighthouse CI and let you know
2020-06-16T16:31:13  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-06-16T18:03:14  <sachin10101998> gmoss did you look at the PRs?
2020-06-16T18:03:27  *** sachin10101998 is now known as dogeman
2020-06-16T18:03:46  <dogeman> jhung^
2020-06-16T19:09:24  <gtirloni> I'd like to disable Jenkins builds for Infusion and Kettle since we have been running with GitHub Actions for over a month now without issues, AFAIK. Does anyone have any objections?
