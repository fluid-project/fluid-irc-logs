2019-09-16T14:18:35  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the table of contents enactor isn't working properly. I believe it's because I'm trying to inject a container before the component is created, but perform both actions off of the same event. https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/FLUID-6148/extension/src/content_scripts/domEnactor.js#L411-L415
2019-09-16T14:19:41  <Justin_o> I might be able to work around this by 1) making use of the newViewComponent to render it's own container, or 2) changing the events up a bit
2019-09-16T14:20:16  <Justin_o> but I'm wondering if something changed in FLUID-6148 that prevents prioritizing an event listener ahead of the component construction for a createOnEvent subcomponent
2019-09-16T14:20:26  <Bosmon2> Justin_o - yes, it did
2019-09-16T14:20:44  <Bosmon2> Although rather it happened the other way round
2019-09-16T14:20:58  <Bosmon2> component construction now happens after notification of the last listener for an event
2019-09-16T14:21:00  *** Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2019-09-16T14:22:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: strange, so it should still be working?
2019-09-16T14:22:32  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it should be, if you are depending on the listener being before the component construction
2019-09-16T14:22:36  <Justin_o> maybe it's something else then.. I'm not getting any errors, the component simply doesn't seem to be created
2019-09-16T14:22:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - where's the createOnEvent?
2019-09-16T14:23:12  <Justin_o> it's in Infusion
2019-09-16T14:24:06  <Justin_o> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L461
2019-09-16T14:24:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-09-16T14:26:02  <Justin_o> I figured it must have something to do with the container timing because it does get injected, but the subcomponent doesn't seem to be created. however on a page that does have the container already provided, it works fine

2019-09-16T15:59:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon: So I dug deeper and it seemed the issue was around multiple containers being injected. This happened for example in cases where there are many articles on a page. Each article would get a Table of Contents container injected.
2019-09-16T16:00:55  *** michelled1 <michelled1!~Adium@205.211.168.102> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-09-16T16:04:12  <Bosmon> Justin_o - they should still all get injected before the component creation - or is there something else going on?
2019-09-16T16:04:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so the component creation simply never happens at all?
2019-09-16T16:04:39  <Justin_o> I think one of the subcomponents was quietly failing because it was getting passed in a selector that matched to multiple containers
2019-09-16T16:05:15  <Justin_o> It's a bit strange because the create on even of the direct subcomponent "tableOfContents" was being fired, but it didn't show up as a member on the parent.
2019-09-16T16:06:01  <Justin_o> this container https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/src/components/tableOfContents/js/TableOfContents.js#L66 was matching multiple elements
2019-09-16T16:06:24  <Justin_o> which is created with "onCreate" would fail
2019-09-16T16:08:14  <Justin_o> This was probably always a problem, but perhaps the order of subcomponent creation happened differently before, the check for the direct subcomponent "tableOfContents" was probably still passing the conditional as expected. https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L514
2019-09-16T16:09:35  <Justin_o> I had thought there weren't any appropriate headers on the page I was testing before, and was getting an empty ToC because of that. But I guess the rendering was failing.. However, this time I noticed a difference because the empty ToC container wasn't being removed when the ToC preference was turned off
2019-09-16T16:17:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here are the changes I made to UIO+ https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/commit/40073a14ed44fbcd12a481f7b844b41f70d2d3c1
2019-09-16T16:17:14  <Justin_o> for the ToC
