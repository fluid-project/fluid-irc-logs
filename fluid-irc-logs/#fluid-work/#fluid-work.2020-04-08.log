2020-04-08T15:38:24  <michelled> it's not the community meeting - based on who's talking, it must be a Morphic meeting :)
2020-04-08T15:42:10  <chaitanya> oh..thank you michelled.
2020-04-08T15:42:42  <chaitanya> So is it going to take place on IRC?

2020-04-08T19:18:36  <HarshSingh[m]> gmoss Hii Gregor can you assign me  some kind of task as the GSOC proposal result would be declared late and I have a lot of free time during this lockdown. So it would be really great if I could get some task.

2020-04-08T20:36:28  <simonjb> cindyli, Justin_o: could I ask you for some help with kettle and infusion? I'd like to run the SJRK app with a customized kettle on my local filesystem. I've updated the sjrk package.json to use kettle from a file: url and I'm able to npm install my local kettle. however, when I try to run the sjrk server, I get an error "infusion has already been loaded from the path" but I can't figure
2020-04-08T20:36:28  <simonjb> out the right steps to get it to run
2020-04-08T20:37:26  <simonjb> I've tried deleting the infusion from kettle but then it says that infusion cannot be found at all
2020-04-08T20:37:55  <simonjb> gmoss, maybe also? ^
2020-04-08T20:38:21  <gmoss> hi HarshSingh[m], we're pretty busy with other work and reviewing proposals at the moment, but if you'd like something to work on that is related to the IDI, I would suggest doing some reading about web accessibility and inclusive design :) there's a whole world of information out there, but some good places to start would be WCAG https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ and our Inclusive Design Guide
2020-04-08T20:38:21  <gmoss> https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/
2020-04-08T20:40:03  <gmoss> simonjb: you could pull from a particular branch of your personal fork of Kettle on GitHub, if you're willing to upload this customized version. Other than that, you could try doing an npm link to point your SJRK site node modules folder for Kettle at your local directory?
2020-04-08T20:40:11  <gmoss> https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html

2020-04-08T20:47:53  <gmoss> simonjb: does Kettle have to be built for distribution the same way Infusion does, and if so did you follow that process with your custom version? I'm not familiar with deploying new releases of Kettle
2020-04-08T20:48:25  *** Bosmon3 <Bosmon3!~Bosmon3@148.252.29.206> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-08T20:48:39  <Justin_o> simonjb: sorry, catching up here..
2020-04-08T20:50:02  <simonjb> thanks Justin_o
2020-04-08T20:50:09  <Justin_o> simonjb, gmoss: is infusion used in node outside of kettle?
2020-04-08T20:50:15  <Justin_o> in SJRK
2020-04-08T20:51:09  <gmoss> Justin_o simonjb: the only usage outside of kettle is on the client side, iirc, but I'll check
2020-04-08T20:51:37  <simonjb> it depends on what "outside of Kettle" means
2020-04-08T20:51:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: that's what I was assuming, so not sure why it would be pulled in multiple times.. although I guess you might be pulling it in from NPM to load on the client
2020-04-08T20:52:30  *** philip <philip!~philip@142.120.64.92> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2020-04-08T20:52:34  <gmoss> Justin_o: the client does load infusion-all.js from the node_modules dir, does that count as "pulling it in from NPM"?
2020-04-08T20:53:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes and in particular if you have it in your package.json
2020-04-08T20:53:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: it is most definitely in the package.json
2020-04-08T20:53:19  <Justin_o> simonjb: are you working form the master branch of SJRK?
2020-04-08T20:53:25  <simonjb> yes
2020-04-08T20:53:30  <Justin_o> I'm just trying to see if I can reproduce it locally
2020-04-08T20:53:41  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-04-08T20:53:48  <simonjb> thanks very much Justin_o

2020-04-08T20:54:02  <gmoss> Justin_o simonjb: are they running incompatible versions of infusion?
2020-04-08T20:54:02  <Justin_o> simonjb: and how did you modify kettle.. did you just make changes in node_modules or somewhere else?
2020-04-08T20:54:22  <gmoss> https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/b886c18b792ea90b4a85cfc8b0e8a7028ea11361/package.json#L29
2020-04-08T20:54:57  <gmoss> Justin_o simonjb: I'm using a late-ish version of Infusion that incorporates Potentia II and immutable options: "3.0.0-dev.20191219T155607Z.32876d29c.FLUID-6145"
2020-04-08T20:55:10  <gmoss> and Kettle 1.11.0
2020-04-08T20:55:13  <simonjb> Justin_o, gmoss: my end goal to be able to experiment with changes to kettle while running sjrk on it, and any way of accomplishing that would be great (I would prefer not to commit to github as I want to make little local changes)
2020-04-08T20:55:37  <gmoss> simonjb: I'm surprised that npm link didn't do the trick!
2020-04-08T20:55:54  <simonjb> Justin_o: my modifications currently are only to add logging statements
2020-04-08T20:56:09  <Justin_o> simonjb: if you aren't committing and just making small changes, I usually find it easy enough use to modify the file in the node_modules directory
2020-04-08T20:56:11  <simonjb> so nothing significant
2020-04-08T20:56:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: good idea! I've done this in the past, didn't occur to me just now
2020-04-08T20:56:37  <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, that's a good suggestion
2020-04-08T20:56:38  <Justin_o> simonjb: the benefit/danger is that you'll lose everything if you npm install again
2020-04-08T20:58:15  <simonjb> if I could have a way to have my own local clone of kettle, that would be preferable, but editing the copy that gets installed inside sjrk node_modules is a good fall back option

2020-04-08T20:59:46  <Justin_o> simonjb: for local copies, I have used npm link before.. but I wonder if there is an issue with the deduping of infusion.. or something with the version of kettle that you're using
2020-04-08T21:00:40  <gmoss> this is a bit of a head-scratcher...
2020-04-08T21:00:46  <Justin_o> I'd imagine the deduce should work because rpm-link is kind of like a redirect to your local repo..
2020-04-08T21:01:52  <gmoss> simonjb: not to be painfully cliché, but assuming you're doing this work on windows, maybe it just needs a reboot? :)
2020-04-08T21:02:27  <simonjb> gmoss: windows, yes, needing a reboot, I hope not
2020-04-08T21:03:01  <simonjb> gmoss: reboot at what stage?
2020-04-08T21:03:06  <Justin_o> simonjb, gmoss: it doesn't look like kettle has a build step like infusion. The Gruntfile is just for linting
2020-04-08T21:03:09  <gmoss> simonjb: those days are few and far between now, fortunately, but not totally gone. It happened to me at least once last year that strange Docker behaviour was solved with a reboot
2020-04-08T21:03:16  <Justin_o> and there isn't dist directory in npm
2020-04-08T21:04:52  <gmoss> simonjb: reboot as in just a general system restart. it's a long shot, for sure, and may solve nothing at all
2020-04-08T21:04:53  <gmoss> Justin_o: hmm..
2020-04-08T21:05:27  <Justin_o> simonjb: where's a good place to put a log in kettle
2020-04-08T21:05:36  <Justin_o> I'm going to test npm link in my setup
2020-04-08T21:06:30  <simonjb> Justin_o: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleRequest.js#L70
2020-04-08T21:06:38  <gmoss> simonjb: another thing to consider, are you using cmd, powershell or WSL? I usually use PS
2020-04-08T21:06:52  <simonjb> gmoss: PS
2020-04-08T21:11:24  <gmoss> simonjb: short of Justin_o confirming that using npm link works for him, I'm at a bit of a loss for the moment
2020-04-08T21:12:07  <gmoss> would it be helpful to pair?
2020-04-08T21:12:21  <simonjb> thanks gmoss, depending on what Justin_o finds, I do have the suggestion of editing inside node_modules
2020-04-08T21:13:12  <simonjb> gmoss: I think I'd prefer to explore myself for now, but I'll let you know if pairing would be helpful, thanks
2020-04-08T21:13:43  <gmoss> simonjb: okay, good luck! I'll be afk for about a half-hour right now, but then I'll be on into the evening if you'd like to reach out
2020-04-08T21:13:55  <simonjb> awesome, thanks gmoss

2020-04-08T21:28:36  <colinclark> I have Node 12 on my windows box I could test with
2020-04-08T21:28:47  <colinclark> but I probably should be writing

2020-04-08T21:28:57  <colinclark> aha
2020-04-08T21:28:59  <Justin_o> 1) I needed to update some command line tools from xcode
2020-04-08T21:29:25  <Justin_o> 2) for node >= 12 you need level down v5+

2020-04-08T21:46:46  <Bosmon3> simonjb, gmoss - I'm just working on the Kettle test for the fix and I ran into this interesting response: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/362187/can-a-caller-abort-an-execution-of-code-invoked-by-http-request/362245#362245
2020-04-08T21:47:07  <Bosmon3> Which sheds a little bit of light on the strange terrain we seemed to be walking over
2020-04-08T21:47:16  <Bosmon3> I hadn't realised that request cancellation was actually out of the scope of HTTP
