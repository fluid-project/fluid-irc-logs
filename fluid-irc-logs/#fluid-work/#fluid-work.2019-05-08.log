2019-05-08T15:49:22  <cindyli> bryan_: i have 2 pads for you actually ;) one is for our check-ins with a little draft for the first one this afternoon - https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/others-s0o4ntk/pad/view/check-in-with-bryan-e81d4n5a
2019-05-08T15:49:45  <cindyli> the other is for you to pick up tasks in the universal repo: https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/others-s0o4ntk/pad/view/bryan-starts-on-universal-vu1c4nd7
2019-05-08T15:50:19  <cindyli> let me know if you have problem accessing them. thanks
2019-05-08T15:51:23  <bryan_> Excellent...I am able to see them. I'll take a look before our meeting today
2019-05-08T15:52:16  <cindyli> great. thanks, bryan_. for some items in the 2nd pad, such as "Walkthru the Universal Code Structure" will require us sitting together walking thru the code base, probably via a screen share
2019-05-08T15:55:17  <bryan_> Makes sense..."walkthru the universal code structure" sounds very poetic!
2019-05-08T15:57:46  <sgithens> cindyli: Everything that used to be in the gpii-dataloader repo is in universal now right?
2019-05-08T15:58:31  <cindyli> i believe yes, sgithens. clown, please correct me if i'm wrong ^
2019-05-08T15:59:31  <clown> sgithens, cindyli, that's right. gpii-dataloader repo is defunct
2019-05-08T15:59:55  <sgithens> clown: And all of it functionally moved to universal?
2019-05-08T16:00:01  <sgithens> not anything else in gpii-ops?
2019-05-08T16:00:19  <clown> yes, sgithens, and the functionality was modified (improved).
2019-05-08T16:00:26  <sgithens> cool, thx
2019-05-08T16:00:52  <clown> not sure what you mean by gpii-ops — there are templates and configuration files to run the dataloader in the cloud.
2019-05-08T16:01:00  <clown> maybe you mean gpii-infra?
2019-05-08T16:01:38  <sgithens> mostly, but it could be any repo.  Basically I just want to know that anything that had been in gpii-dataloader historically can now be found in gpii/universal
2019-05-08T16:02:06  <clown> historically or hysterically?
2019-05-08T16:02:09  <clown> :-)
2019-05-08T16:02:15  <sgithens> or just period :)
2019-05-08T16:02:24  <sgithens> there wouldn't be any other repos to grep
2019-05-08T16:02:32  <clown> yes, anything that had been in gpii-dataloader is now in universal.
2019-05-08T16:02:37  <sgithens> awesome, thanks!
2019-05-08T16:03:00  <sgithens> I'm working on document migration scripts, and wanted to review the dataloader code again
2019-05-08T16:03:20  <clown> gpii-dataloader, when it existed, was just a subset of universal and we realized we could just use universal for the docker image rather than create a special dataloader image.
2019-05-08T16:03:48  <clown> gotcha.  the dataloader code is in universal.

2019-05-08T18:19:39  *** clown <clown!clown@nat/ocadu/x-qhexqxsmkwgjzavg> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2019-05-08T18:25:00  <bryan_> sgithens: my fix for 3119/3677 involved changing Capture.js instead of changing the solutions registry like the ticket suggested. I did this because the SPI settings worked in the app but not the capture tool so I made my fix capture tool specific. Bosmon suggested making an isolated PR with just this fix (implying it should be moved out of capture tool code). Thoughts?

2019-05-08T18:34:44  <cindyli> sgithens, Bosmon, to add to bryan_'s question, Bosmon suggested to create a self contained pull request for 3119 (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3119) that is to modify spi settings in win32.json5. is this the first step for fixing 3677?
2019-05-08T18:35:07  <cindyli> bryan_: you didn't touch win32.json5 for fixing 3677, right?
2019-05-08T18:42:03  <bryan_>  Correct I did not touch win32.json5

2019-05-08T20:18:36  <sgithens> bryan_ cindyli It probably makes sense for it to be self contained.  It would probably be simpler to review and test.  I just happened to be doing all of this in the context of getting the settings to snapshot correctly
2019-05-08T20:21:48  <cindyli> sgithens: i'm not very familiar with the solution registry and I could be wrong: 3119 looks like an improvement to me rather than a bug. is it a bug that should be fixed?
2019-05-08T20:22:20  <cindyli> btw, could you fix links in the description. they now point to wrong places due to recent changes to win32.json5

2019-05-08T20:54:18  <bryan_> Looks pretty straightforward to change the shape of the json to move the path from one block to the other. Are we sure there are no adverse consequences to doing that? Are there areas of the code that expect the path in capabilitiesTransform that would complain after I remove them?

2019-05-08T20:57:44  <cindyli> bryan_: sgithens might know better where this block is used and why it should be moved. but one way to discover the consequences is to run universal and windows tests.

2019-05-08T21:08:37  <sgithens> cindyli: ok, sorry. to answer your question, it could be possible that the refactoring of the paths isn't necessary to actually fix, but I linked to it to the original ticket, since I remembered from a previous talk we had a long time ago that it may be a source of the issues.  The real concern I have is just being able to retrieve and verify some settings from `gpii.flowManager.capture.getSystemSettingsCapture` which is
2019-05-08T21:08:37  <sgithens> why I had been emphasizing creating some windows acceptance tests the past few weeks

2019-05-08T21:09:26  <sgithens> for instance, if we could get some tests showing that https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5007 or really any SPI backed solutions could be effectly returned from getSystemSettingsCapture, then I'd be happy
2019-05-08T21:10:09  <sgithens> but I don't believe any of the regular unit tests are going to demonstrate that, because they aren't calling a legit windows implementation of those solutions
2019-05-08T21:11:52  <sgithens> high contrast would actually be a better one since it's in active use in the pilots https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6351

2019-05-08T21:17:49  <bryan_> I think we need to refactor the paths to prevent the capture tool from throwing an error every time it tries to access spi settings, either by moving the path (what I'm trying now) or by modifying the data after the fact in Capture.js (what I tried before). Once this is done, the tests will run and pass, and then we can be assured that we can get spi settings from that call
