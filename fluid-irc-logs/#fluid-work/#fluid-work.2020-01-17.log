2020-01-17T17:28:56  <gmoss> cindyli: curiously, the issue doesn't seem to have much to do with the script injection. it looks like it's the UIO messageResolver for the table of contents that's causing the issue, somehow. I can't reproduce it on other page tests, nor outside of the test fixtures themselves. very strange!
2020-01-17T17:29:14  <gmoss> I'll keep digging
2020-01-17T17:29:56  <cindyli> interesting

2020-01-17T18:06:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: just seeing your message from yesterday evening about the cancellable promises. I updated my FLUID-6420 to the latest FLUID-6145 branch and didn't notice any issues. I'm planning to test the latest dev release of FLUID-6145 with UIO+ later, I'm only on for about an hour more today, but will try to get to that if I can.

2020-01-17T21:08:44  <gmoss> cindyli: I found a solution to the race condition and all tests are passing
2020-01-17T21:09:01  <cindyli> yay!
2020-01-17T21:09:17  <gmoss> this is the fix: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35/commits/2093595d585209d23f7bbcf1be2cf9c884720622
2020-01-17T21:10:13  <cindyli> nice
2020-01-17T21:11:39  <gmoss> I think that since the locale for the page and therefore the messageLoader is being set on init, it then tried to create the TOC, but sometimes it was too early, I guess. I'm still not fully at ease with the setup as it is, but this is enough to get rid of the symptom
2020-01-17T21:12:12  <gmoss> later on we should give careful consideration (hopefully with input from Justin_o and Bosmon) on which events can reliably be waited on to indicate that UIO is "done" setting itself up and rendering on the page
2020-01-17T21:12:19  <gmoss> if any such events exist
2020-01-17T21:15:57  <gmoss> cindyli: officially ready for more review :)
2020-01-17T21:16:29  <gmoss> I think maybe merging should wait until Bosmon has had a chance to weigh in on the purposes of this re-review branch
2020-01-17T21:19:26  <cindyli> cool. thanks, gmoss
