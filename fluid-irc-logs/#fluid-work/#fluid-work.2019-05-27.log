2019-05-27T19:40:24  <gmoss> i'm currently working on recolouring the footer logos for contrast themes

2019-05-27T19:40:37  <gmoss> but michelled suggested we merge without that for now

2019-05-27T20:29:44  <cindyli> gmoss, can you clarify this reply: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/25#issuecomment-496299399? if i merge the PR as is into stories-floe-production branch, "explore tool" link on the production site will be pointing to the staging site, isn't that weird?
2019-05-27T20:31:33  <cindyli> i think i understand what you meant.
2019-05-27T20:32:09  <cindyli> as editing on the production is disabled, the only place to try editing is the staging site
2019-05-27T20:32:16  <cindyli> sorry and thanks.
2019-05-27T20:35:44  <gmoss> cindyli: your understanding is correct, editing on production site will be disabled (as it is now) and the only place to try it will be staging (after it is re-enabled)
2019-05-27T20:35:59  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm going to sign off for now, back on in an hour if need be
