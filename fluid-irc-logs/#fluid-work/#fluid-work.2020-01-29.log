2020-01-29T09:53:17  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, I tried a few variations on the "mangled closing brace" pattern Gregor found.
2020-01-29T09:53:18  <the-t-in-rtf> https://pastebin.com/cdrhxg1Q
2020-01-29T09:53:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I never see the type of error you seemed to expect.
2020-01-29T09:53:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to ask what should be catching that and whether/where I should report a bug.
2020-01-29T09:54:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I am trying this with 3.0.0-dev.20191220T163226Z.db83ce0ef.FLUID-6145, BTW.
2020-01-29T10:04:09  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you should receive that error at the point the component is instantiated
2020-01-29T10:04:22  <Bosmon> You should report it in the Infusion JIRA
2020-01-29T10:09:16  <the-t-in-rtf> will do
2020-01-29T10:14:50  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6450
2020-01-29T10:52:10  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - thanks very much
2020-01-29T11:02:51  <the-t-in-rtf> no problem.  I'm glad I found it this way, my bug coincidentally was canceled out by the behaviour of Infusion.
2020-01-29T11:04:11  <the-t-in-rtf> so now instead of two wrongs making a right, my code is one right making a right
2020-01-29T11:04:39  <Bosmon> I guess you had a test problem too
2020-01-29T11:16:23  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, in that I provide toggles for others that I don't myself use or test.
2020-01-29T11:17:00  <the-t-in-rtf> like that "new state" option, which could never have actually worked
2020-01-29T11:18:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I am already thinking about how to improve that, if you meant something else, now's a good time to pile one
2020-01-29T11:27:23  <the-t-in-rtf> pile on, even

2020-01-29T13:18:58  <gmoss> Bosmon: I notice there are two PR's on the Storytelling Tool for dependency updates. is this something that happens automagically in fluid-project repos? do you know how this got here? just trying to get a little context before I test out these branches and leave my stamp of approval :)
2020-01-29T13:22:03  <Bosmon> gmoss - there is a github bot that produces them automatically
2020-01-29T13:22:06  <Bosmon> You can opt out of them
2020-01-29T13:22:14  <Bosmon> I think somehow you also have to sign the CLA on its behalf : P
2020-01-29T13:22:25  <gmoss> Bosmon: I don't mind! I'll look into the CLA haha I did notice that as well
2020-01-29T13:23:03  <gmoss> as long as we're reasonably confident it isn't malicious ;)

2020-01-29T14:04:25  <Bosmon> gmoss - I found the following note about what to do re CLA assistant and dependabot
2020-01-29T14:04:27  <Bosmon> https://github.com/dependabot/feedback/issues/615
2020-01-29T14:04:37  <Bosmon> Of course it is all very awkward when one's bots pick fights amongst themselves
2020-01-29T14:05:08  <Bosmon> It seems that we can probably just whitelist dependabot if we want to ... but that implies whoever set up the CLA assistant needs to whitelist it
2020-01-29T14:06:18  <Bosmon> https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant/issues/173
2020-01-29T14:06:53  <gmoss> Bosmon: I think even if it weren't for that non-exclusive, worldwide license granted by the company to the bot's contributions, I believe non-human work is not copyrightable (at time of writing) so it wouldn't really be litigable anyway :)
2020-01-29T14:07:05  <gmoss> yeah I was going to talk to Justin_o once he got in about whitelisting it
2020-01-29T14:07:25  <gmoss> It may be something we can control on a repo-specific basis

2020-01-29T15:03:31  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli, sgithens - I have raised a new Worrying Issue: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4329
2020-01-29T15:03:49  *** the-t-in-rtf <the-t-in-rtf!~Adium@212.123.218.234> has joined #fluid-work
2020-01-29T15:06:38  <cindyli> Bosmon: i wonder what's the backwards-incompatible problem this jira will address. is it when the cloud has the new SR implemented but the local Morphic installations (LFMs) are still using the old code that doesn't include the change in GPII-3119 PRs?
2020-01-29T15:06:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - correct
2020-01-29T15:06:53  <Bosmon> But not the new SR
2020-01-29T15:07:29  <Bosmon> sgithens GPII-3119 makes an immediate change to the structure of the SR
2020-01-29T15:07:39  <Bosmon> If this ever gets deployed into the cloud, it will destroy all current clients

2020-01-29T15:09:47  <cindyli> Bosmon: i agree. however, once we implement https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4329, all clients also need to be updated to have the new change, otherwise they will still be not compatible with the new cloud. isn't it the same as updating all clients when sgithens' change gets deployed into the cloud?

2020-01-29T15:10:31  <Bosmon> We need to fix this now
2020-01-29T15:12:14  <cindyli> Bosmon: ok, i see, in the GPII-4329 you said "If this field is missing, the value will default to "1" indicating the current, now legacy format", old clients will have the field missing so the oldest format of SR will be delivered. cool
