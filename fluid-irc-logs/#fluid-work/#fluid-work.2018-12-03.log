2018-12-03T08:55:57  <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon , I'm addressing your Friday reviews, thanks for the feedback. Also, were you able to take a look to this https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-2986/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L282 to confirm if that was your suggestion?

2018-12-03T10:48:47  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, is the statement at the bottom of this file accurate?
2018-12-03T10:48:47  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-nvda-testSpec.txt
2018-12-03T10:49:09  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. do you actually have to have NVDA installed?
2018-12-03T10:50:02  <the-t-in-rtf> or is it all handled with the fakey installedSolutions.json setup?
2018-12-03T11:09:13  <stegru> dandimitrov, I've updated the language branch to return the full language code (bg-BG)
2018-12-03T11:09:21  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - something like that, yes, although the extra function level doesn't seem necessary
2018-12-03T11:09:28  <Bosmon> It's a shame to take bryan's exercise away from him : P
2018-12-03T11:09:50  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - how could we make tests of NVDA without having it installed?
2018-12-03T11:09:58  <Bosmon> Here we are talking of acceptance tests rather than integration tests, right?
2018-12-03T11:10:19  <the-t-in-rtf> so, I guess someone runs those manually, is my point.
2018-12-03T11:10:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the windows image doesn't have actual AT installed, so we can't be testing that in CI.
2018-12-03T11:11:14  <the-t-in-rtf> Asking because I am onboarding MAGIC at the moment and want to know what the expectation is for acceptance tests.
2018-12-03T11:11:51  <the-t-in-rtf> All my previous work was updating existing solutions, so I got to be more lazy and ignorant than usual.
2018-12-03T11:17:04  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, the expectation was that someone, perhaps, "from QA", would be responsible for running these acceptance tests against real AT manually
2018-12-03T11:17:12  <Bosmon> I don't think that in practice this has ever been done other than informally
2018-12-03T11:17:57  <the-t-in-rtf> Good to know where we stand.
2018-12-03T11:18:32  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - we also planned, "in the fulness of time", for real vagrant boxes to be built which actually contained the the AT so that they could be run in CI
2018-12-03T11:18:44  <Bosmon> But naturally this requires us to solve the respective licencing issues, etc.
2018-12-03T11:18:57  <Bosmon> I imagine we could extend our existing CI tests to free software like NVDA fairly easily
2018-12-03T11:19:14  <the-t-in-rtf> yes.  someone made a chocolatey installer for JAWS in demo mode for example, but it's horribly out of date
2018-12-03T11:20:22  <the-t-in-rtf> and there isn't one for MAGIC for example
2018-12-03T11:21:30  <the-t-in-rtf> there's one for NVDA , and it's up to date
2018-12-03T11:22:18  <the-t-in-rtf> on a side note, they are super unfortunate to have third or fourth tier domain name and to share an acronym with Nvidia's stock symbol.
2018-12-03T11:22:31  <the-t-in-rtf> took me ages to actually find them and not dentists in Nevada.
2018-12-03T11:22:47  <the-t-in-rtf> or stock tickers for NVidia
2018-12-03T11:33:40  <the-t-in-rtf> MAGIC is a really fun one to test, you can only change a lot of the settings with it on.
2018-12-03T11:34:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I was just trying to find the upper range for magnification, which is super tough if you can only do so while magnifying by 50x
2018-12-03T11:34:18  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "javjarfer - something like that,"> yeah, seems useless now
2018-12-03T11:34:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll try setting it to something insane and seeing if it rounds down
2018-12-03T11:35:14  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "It's a shame to take bryan's exe"> Bosmon: Oh, yeah of course, didn't meant to, the last commit for that was 9 days ago, that's why I god confused. Maybe the update was not properly visualized in the pull request
2018-12-03T11:35:26  <javjarfer[m]> got confused*
2018-12-03T11:55:02  <dandimitrov> Hey, stegru, thanks. I’ve already tested and it works great

2018-12-03T15:56:29  <jhernandez> dunno
2018-12-03T15:56:37  <jhernandez> I was wondering about the electron3 slowness
2018-12-03T15:57:24  <jhernandez> you said the slowness was coming from the process reporter
2018-12-03T15:57:46  <jhernandez> and I'm wondering if it's just an edge-related thing
2018-12-03T15:58:45  <stegru> no, I don't think so - I replaced the c# code with just 'return', and it went faster
2018-12-03T15:59:02  <stegru> so, it's the actual code.. rather than edge-js
2018-12-03T15:59:16  <stegru> yes, i thought it was edge taking a while to start

2018-12-03T16:36:27  <Bosmon> jhernandez - so javjarfer[m] and I have bombed out on our "sample task" for bryan, given javjarfer[m] had largely resolved it
2018-12-03T16:36:37  <Bosmon> Any further suggests for some kind of bite-sized piece of work he can do to get going?
2018-12-03T16:37:38  <Bosmon> Anyone else involved with the GPII here, please also do contribute some suggestion for some piece of work suitable for someone new to the project which will help them get through the workflow of formulating and submitting a PR without too much contextual knowledge about the rest of the system
2018-12-03T16:39:45  <javjarfer[m]> Oh! Bosmon what about documenting the transforms which are available inside "fluid.transforms"?
2018-12-03T16:40:14  <javjarfer[m]> That looks like something which could be nice for getting someone familiar with the core framework
2018-12-03T16:40:53  <Bosmon> Probably an implementation task would be more helpful, than a docs task for something which the writer doesn't yet understand : P
2018-12-03T16:42:20  <Bosmon> I did file this as I was looking at the WMI settings handler impl: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3554
2018-12-03T16:42:24  <Bosmon> Perhaps this is doable
2018-12-03T16:44:28  <javjarfer[m]> yeah, that looks really doable
2018-12-03T16:45:19  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "Probably an implementation task "> well, you totally got a point there. It's better to choose impl then
2018-12-03T16:45:49  <javjarfer[m]> Also, which tool did you use for seeing the coverage there?
2018-12-03T16:46:10  <javjarfer[m]> Should we accept only pulls in the future that have 100% coverage Bosmon ?
2018-12-03T16:46:27  <michelled> colinclark, sepidehshahi: my room?
2018-12-03T16:46:38  <colinclark> yup, can you give me a couple minutes?
2018-12-03T16:46:43  <michelled> yep!
2018-12-03T16:46:54  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - 100% isn't necessary, but we have a sort of informal target of > 90% branch coverage
2018-12-03T16:47:27  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - our standard build of the core projects now always outputs coverage information into the "/reports" directly of the project on a successful test run, thanks to the-t-in-rtf
2018-12-03T16:47:28  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "javjarfer - 100% isn't necessary"> that is really ncie
2018-12-03T16:48:42  <Bosmon> We expect every implementation branch visited in normal use to be covered, but usually make exceptions for very small error-handling paths
2018-12-03T16:49:14  <colinclark> ok, i'm all set michelled
2018-12-03T16:50:01  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: great, is that in master? I haven't seen that information and I think I have my current branch even with master
2018-12-03T16:52:45  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - it's been in master for some time
2018-12-03T16:53:06  <javjarfer[m]> Then, I'm not doing what is necessary for getting the report
2018-12-03T16:53:34  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - "npm test" should be fine
2018-12-03T16:56:23  *** jhung is now known as jhung_away
2018-12-03T16:56:39  <javjarfer[m]> oh, thanks Bosmon I see the instanbul references in the package.json, my bad for always executing the tests using the bare "node command + the particular target test file"
2018-12-03T16:57:25  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yeah, I saw https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3554
2018-12-03T16:57:34  <jhernandez> and I thought it could be a good one for Bryan, right
2018-12-03T16:58:01  <jhernandez> this task involves learning a bit about our testing infrastructure

2018-12-03T18:54:55  <stegru> ok
2018-12-03T18:55:25  <jhernandez> and can't tell what's the best approach to get it fixed after looking your last comment on the JIRA
2018-12-03T18:56:23  <stegru> well, I do know what's making the c# slow - but I don't think there's any way to fix it, without losing information
2018-12-03T18:56:49  <jhernandez> first thing that comes to my mind is, why UI is affected? aren't we async and non-blocking when executing .net code?
2018-12-03T18:56:50  <stegru> but, that information isn't required for where this slowdown occurs.
2018-12-03T18:57:07  <stegru> ah good point

2018-12-03T18:58:13  <stegru> but, all the metrics needs is pid => exe name
2018-12-03T19:00:11  <jhernandez> I mean, I can live with a 3rd party performance-related limitation, but why on hell is it somehow causing a delay in the UI?
2018-12-03T19:00:38  <stegru> because node only has 1 thread :)
2018-12-03T19:00:49  <jhernandez> yeah
2018-12-03T19:01:17  <stegru> the .net code can put in its own thread, however

2018-12-03T19:03:26  <stegru> but this is the main slowdown: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/processReporter/dotNetProcesses.csx#L81
2018-12-03T19:04:17  <stegru> it enumerates the processes, inside an enumeration of processes
2018-12-03T19:07:03  <stegru> so, it's performing the operation process-count ^ 2 times (as well as other stuff), when the metrics only needs it 1 time

2018-12-03T21:22:28  <Justin_o> jhung: i was going to look at something on the fluid project site, but i can't seem to build DocPad for it
2018-12-03T21:22:52  <Justin_o> i'm not sure if it's something with my setup or if it has just become too out of date for newer versions of docpad
2018-12-03T21:23:09  <jhung> Justin_o: did you check the Readme for instructions?
2018-12-03T21:23:29  <jhung> The configuration may have been different for Fluid
2018-12-03T21:23:56  <Justin_o> jhung: yes.. i did.. i'm just trying to run "docpad run"
2018-12-03T21:24:10  <Justin_o> but i get an error TypeError: _ref.dispose is not a function
2018-12-03T21:25:08  <jhung> Justin_o: yeah could be an issue with the version being old. We might have to update the project to work with newer version of docked.
2018-12-03T21:25:12  <jhung> *docpad
2018-12-03T21:25:34  <alanharnum> Justin_o: it looks good to me, lliskovoi's going to check it tomorrow & then we can merge
