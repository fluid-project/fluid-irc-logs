2020-08-10T13:55:32  <raunak> colinbdclark  can you give me 5 minutes to discuss this   issue https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/issues/176#issuecomment-671367225
2020-08-10T13:58:49  <colinclark> raunak: What’s on your mind?
2020-08-10T14:05:19  <raunak> as i check this issue is  visible in all types of devices
2020-08-10T14:05:39  <colinclark> raunak: I can’t reproduce it on my phone
2020-08-10T14:05:53  <colinclark> Which doesn’t mean it’s not an issue, but likely means it’s only an issue sometimes
2020-08-10T14:06:03  <colinclark> Did you test all on “all types of devices?”
2020-08-10T14:13:46  <raunak> see https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/eHxOuYbq/now.PNG

2020-08-10T14:16:39  <colinclark> raunak: I don’t doubt that you fixed something, in some environment
2020-08-10T14:16:55  <colinclark> But I just want to double-check that you read and understood my comment on the issue you filed
2020-08-10T14:17:03  <colinclark> as well as the comment on the pull request
2020-08-10T14:17:16  <colinclark> Right now the site is in the midst of being partially redesigned, especially the front page
2020-08-10T14:17:43  <colinclark> this means the styling is already changing, and so we don’t want to introduce new changes in the old site until the new site is finished
2020-08-10T14:18:05  <colinclark> It’s also in the midst of being ported to a static site generator by a GSoC student this year, which will change the way the site is styled and built
2020-08-10T14:18:27  <colinclark> So right now, we’re not going to merge your pull request, or spend much time testing it, unfortunately
2020-08-10T14:31:41  <dogeman> hey gmoss did you look into that timezone issue?
