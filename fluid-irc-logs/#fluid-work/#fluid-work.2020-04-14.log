2020-04-14T17:47:37  <Justin_o> colinclark: hi Colin, regarding https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4345 I started work on this to create a build that would build extensions for both UIO+ and UIO+ for Morphic from the same repo. https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/GPII-4345/Gruntfile.js#L180-L200
2020-04-14T17:49:02  <Justin_o> I'm wondering though, if I should just split these into separate repos, and have UIO+ for Morphic pull in UIO+ from NPM. In this case we'd have the Morphic specific code in UIO+ for morphic repo and merge that into the UIO+ code with some build step.
2020-04-14T17:49:39  <colinclark> Justin_o: I’d say we should split them, yes
2020-04-14T17:49:46  <colinclark> and have a dependency via npm if possible
2020-04-14T17:50:10  <colinclark> as soon as we get some weird features in the “for Morphic” version that we don’t want to include in the standard version, we’ll be happy about that, I think?

2020-04-14T17:52:18  <Justin_o> colinclark: currently the only morphic specific part is the consumption of the preferences from morphic, via the webhook... coming down the pipe shortly are sending prefs back to morphic ( https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4218 ) and opening URLs for morphic (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4410). I'd like to get this split down before those parts go in.
2020-04-14T17:53:16  <colinclark> yes
2020-04-14T17:53:20  <colinclark> I completely agree, Justin_o
2020-04-14T17:53:33  <colinclark> If it’s not super complex to do so, I strongly support separate repositories
2020-04-14T17:53:44  <colinclark> and this is exactly how I explained it to Gregg
2020-04-14T17:54:56  <Justin_o> colinclark: here's what I think I'll do.. let me know if you think this is okay or if there is a better approach. I'm going to create a new empty repo in the fluid-project space called UIO+ or something like that. Then I'll push to that from my current checkout of the gpii-chrome-extension repo. That way we'll keep all the history in both repos. From there I'll clean up the UIO+ repo to remove any morphic stuff and
2020-04-14T17:54:56  <Justin_o> publish to NPM
2020-04-14T17:55:26  <Justin_o> Then I'll clean up the gpii-chrome-extension to consume UIO+
2020-04-14T17:55:55  <colinclark> that seems fine
2020-04-14T17:56:10  <Justin_o> once they are both done, I guess I'll publish a new beta release for both of them. I guess publishing the UIO+ for Morphic as a new extension, and keeping the existing one for UIO+

2020-04-14T19:30:34  <gmoss> batey96_: you're welcome :)
2020-04-14T19:33:30  <Justin_o> Teddy___: I'm looking at the Vuex but not seeing anything for sitePages in the debugger.. should I be seeing something there, or is it located somewhere else?
2020-04-14T19:35:40  <batey96_> One more thing i realised on the infusion documentation framework.Pageload time on without cache mechanism is high(noticed it on some pages).Can i file this as an issue??
2020-04-14T19:35:53  <Teddy___> Justin_o: No they are not supposed to be empty arrays
2020-04-14T19:36:14  <Teddy___> and all the `isFetched` should be `true`
2020-04-14T19:36:28  <Justin_o> okay, so there is something further upstream that is not working
2020-04-14T19:36:45  <Teddy___> for some reason this is not the case but I havn't figured that out yet
2020-04-14T19:36:59  <Justin_o> okay, so you are seeing the same problem
2020-04-14T19:38:24  <Teddy___> Justin_o: it doesn't load instantly but after clicking around to News and Views pages it will fetch the arrays for the state
2020-04-14T19:40:16  <gmoss> batey96_: please do feel free to file an issue, though it may not be tackled for quite a while
2020-04-14T19:40:54  <gmoss> I imagine, if we do the work for GSoC, that the performance will be improved with whatever new SSG we end up using
2020-04-14T19:43:22  <sachin10101998> gmoss batey96_ hugo provides partial caching system to cache partials thus avoiding re rendering of stuff
2020-04-14T19:43:59  <sachin10101998> in case we go for hugo
2020-04-14T19:47:27  <batey96_> Okay thanks gmoss.Atleast for the few months while its still on the web,we could improve(though it costs nothing)

2020-04-14T20:21:28  <Justin_o> Teddy___: same with the news page.. from the News page, it looks like it is being run against the contents of the news item blocks but not the full page
2020-04-14T20:21:44  <Justin_o> sorry, not sure I'm explaining it well, but hopefully that means something to you
2020-04-14T20:27:58  <Justin_o> Teddy___: it looks like the headers are actually added from the NewsItem.vue component ( https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/components/NewsItem.vue#L8 )
2020-04-14T20:28:13  <greatislander> Justin_o Teddy___ One thing to be aware of is that we shouldn't be trying to process the content for News/Views
2020-04-14T20:28:48  <greatislander> The sidebar should only appear for generic pages and Views items (e.g. this one: https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/the-importance-of-peripheral-vision)
2020-04-14T20:29:06  <greatislander> And if there are no headers, I think the sidebar should be empty.
2020-04-14T20:29:24  <Justin_o> greatislander: I see, not the views page, but an actual view
2020-04-14T20:29:34  <greatislander> Correct
2020-04-14T20:30:03  <greatislander> I think the best way to think of that sidebar is it is kind of like UIO's table of contents
2020-04-14T20:30:26  <Justin_o> greatislander: it doesn't  look like there are any h2's in the views.. so the about page would be the best to test with?
2020-04-14T20:30:32  <Teddy___> greatislander: that is currently being handled by the v-if directive, <nav v-if="headers.length>0>
2020-04-14T20:30:45  <greatislander> Yeah, About/Inclusion Challenges (which has one)
2020-04-14T20:30:58  <greatislander> thanks Teddy___, that's great
2020-04-14T20:31:15  <Justin_o> Teddy___: I don't seem to be getting any of the console logs for those pages.. are they setup to run with your code?
2020-04-14T20:31:41  <Teddy___> yes they are
2020-04-14T20:31:57  <Teddy___> maybe the sitePages array in the state is empty
2020-04-14T20:34:14  <Justin_o> Teddy___: yes, that's what I'm seeing in the console
2020-04-14T20:35:58  <Teddy___> that array only gets filled with items after store.dispatch("fetchSitePages") is called
2020-04-14T20:36:12  <Teddy___> it only gets called on the search page

2020-04-14T20:43:15  <Justin_o> Teddy___: is that because the store is only used for dynamic content?
2020-04-14T20:44:10  <Justin_o> Teddy___, cindyli: I thought we weren't using the WP search api because we were going to check the store.. but it looks like the store is making requests out to WP.. is that correct, or am I mistaking something
2020-04-14T20:46:00  <cindyli> Justin_o: yes, the store makes requests to WP to fetch news posts, views posts and site pages when needed.
2020-04-14T20:46:23  <Teddy___> we are not using it to do searches
2020-04-14T20:46:36  <Teddy___> just grabbing content
2020-04-14T20:46:54  <cindyli> it only fetches them once and reuse fetched data afterwards since the wecount website will always work with static set of data
2020-04-14T20:47:20  <cindyli> whenever someone changes the data via WP admin site, the wecount website will be redeployed to reflect the new data
2020-04-14T20:47:35  <Justin_o> cindyli: why not do the fetch at build time
2020-04-14T20:47:55  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.120.220.187> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-14T20:48:00  <Justin_o> Teddy___: ^
2020-04-14T20:48:11  <cindyli> Justin_o: we could but not necessary
2020-04-14T20:48:23  <cindyli> most pages will have static pages
2020-04-14T20:48:45  <Justin_o> cindyli: where is the store cached?
2020-04-14T20:48:45  <cindyli> if someone only visits those static pages, the fetch from the backend is unnecessary
2020-04-14T20:49:02  <cindyli> in memory as variables i believe
2020-04-14T20:50:45  <Justin_o> cindyli: so I guess that means that 1) if we go to the search page we are potentially loading all of the news, views, and site pages into memory
2020-04-14T20:51:01  <Justin_o> Teddy___: ^
2020-04-14T20:51:09  <cindyli> that's true
2020-04-14T20:51:52  <Justin_o> cindyli, Teddy___: also it seems that the current scheme for checking the headings requires that we load all of the site pages for most of the pages.. with the exception of the news and views page
2020-04-14T20:52:22  <Justin_o> I'm not actually sure what site pages are though..
2020-04-14T20:52:36  <cindyli> Justin_o: yes. but it will only be loaded once
2020-04-14T20:53:04  <cindyli> like "about" page, "inclusion challenges" etc
2020-04-14T20:53:08  <cindyli> and home page too
2020-04-14T20:53:25  <Justin_o> cindyli: so just those 3 pages, what about the individual views, are those included in the site pages?
2020-04-14T20:53:49  <cindyli> Justin_o: no, they are from different WP APIs
2020-04-14T20:53:56  <Justin_o> okay
2020-04-14T20:54:33  <cindyli> API for getting news and views posts - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/shared/DataFetcher.js#L38
2020-04-14T20:54:54  <cindyli> site pages are fetched from /pages API - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/shared/DataFetcher.js#L61
2020-04-14T20:55:02  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-14T20:55:50  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. so what I'm worried about is the initial load of the page will be slow if store hasn't been cached.. maybe that won't be too much of an issue for the about page.. what if you direct link to a view.. does it have to load in all of the views before the first one will show up.. for example if we direct linked to this one https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/continuing-our-work-during-covid-19
2020-04-14T20:56:09  <Justin_o> how will this work on slow connections and when we have many views
2020-04-14T20:56:46  <cindyli> there will be static pages for all posts such as https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/views/continuing-our-work-during-covid-19
2020-04-14T20:57:07  <cindyli> and for /views, /views/page/1 etc. same for news pages
2020-04-14T20:57:45  <cindyli> the fetch of views from WP will be performed at: search, filter
2020-04-14T20:58:20  <Justin_o> cindyli, Teddy___: but it's also being used for the headers though, so maybe the answer is that we can't look into the store for the headers
2020-04-14T20:58:48  <greatislander> Justin_o, cindli, Teddy___ it seems to me like we shouldn't use the store for the headers
2020-04-14T20:59:06  <cindyli> Justin_o: i'm working on it right now. the fetch of headings will be performed at this action - https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store#the-nuxtserverinit-action
2020-04-14T20:59:17  <cindyli> once the site starts up
2020-04-14T20:59:42  <greatislander> can't we do the parsing and prepare the headers when we generate the pages statically? cindyli?
2020-04-14T20:59:47  <cindyli> but as always, the fetch will happen once and be reused after that
2020-04-14T21:00:10  <greatislander> Would be part of this issue
2020-04-14T21:00:11  <greatislander> https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/90
2020-04-14T21:01:46  <cindyli> greatislander: my research and experiment so far shows the use of headers data is different from what's in page components
2020-04-14T21:02:15  <cindyli> the header data is required in the Header component which is not a page component
2020-04-14T21:02:46  <greatislander> isn't the aside?
2020-04-14T21:03:00  <greatislander> *it
2020-04-14T21:03:26  <cindyli> header is the same. both header and aside are in default.vue
2020-04-14T21:03:30  <cindyli> and footer
2020-04-14T21:03:31  <cindyli> too
2020-04-14T21:03:38  <Teddy___> Yes it is the Aside component
2020-04-14T21:04:15  <cindyli> so i'm not sure if the header data can be generated as part of static pages because page components don't expect the input of the header data
2020-04-14T21:04:48  <cindyli> header data will be fetched at `nuxtServerInit` and directly pass to "header" component
2020-04-14T21:05:06  <cindyli> it won't go thru page components at all
2020-04-14T21:05:25  <Justin_o> cindyli, Teddy___: how does a "page" know which content to actually display
2020-04-14T21:07:32  <Teddy___> for the Aside?
2020-04-14T21:08:00  <cindyli> Justin_o: each page should tell via data(), asyncData() or computed blocks. one example - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/pages/views/index.vue#L14-L19
2020-04-14T21:09:39  <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry, I have to head off.. I'm wondering if there is a way, that doesn't use the store, to pass the data.. similar to how the non view pages might know what contents to show.
2020-04-14T21:09:46  <Justin_o> but I'm not sure how those mechanisms work
2020-04-14T21:12:33  <cindyli> Justin_o: there is another way i know of, which is much more difficult because we need to pass data around in parent and children components
2020-04-14T21:12:42  <cindyli> there might be other ways that i don't know of
2020-04-14T21:13:02  <cindyli> the store is the easiest way to share data among components
2020-04-14T21:13:36  <cindyli> as you know, every page can contain any number of components and subcomponents and sub-sub… :)
2020-04-14T21:13:58  <cindyli> don't want to hold you off. see you tomorrow. I'm heading offline soon too
