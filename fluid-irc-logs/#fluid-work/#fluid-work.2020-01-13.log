2020-01-13T15:19:00  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's a pretty long-term comment so yes it's fine to leave
2020-01-13T15:19:10  <Bosmon> I don't expect we will come up with quick or clear answers to that question :)
2020-01-13T15:19:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, are you saying I shouldn't bother to add a JSDoc comment to it either?
2020-01-13T15:20:06  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well it would certainly help, if you felt you had time to add a comment that was informative : P

2020-01-13T15:21:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. I'll poke around at it for a bit and see if I can figure out something useful/informative to add

2020-01-13T15:42:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  hmm.. just noticed that fluid.stringTemplate uses this syntax https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/972/files#diff-eb23eba7203e400016bc578a4faf8ddbR3093 for defining these unknown property names. I believe we discussed using a syntax like https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/967/files#diff-19c203c361f631c67ddd05938a3f1a01R49
2020-01-13T15:42:52  <Justin_o> did you prefer one over the other, and/or am I misunderstanding something
2020-01-13T15:44:02  <Justin_o> maybe the cases are slightly different
2020-01-13T15:44:31  <Justin_o> the former being the type, and the latter being the property name
2020-01-13T15:49:50  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm not quite sure what this syntax is:  @property {Any} [key: String]
2020-01-13T15:53:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon: was trying indicate a property for which we don't know the value
2020-01-13T15:53:18  <Justin_o> or the name for that matter
2020-01-13T15:53:28  <Justin_o> we spoke a bit about this the other day and you were pointing me at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56225401/dynamic-keys-in-jsdoc-typedef
2020-01-13T15:53:43  <Justin_o> and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59063496/document-structure-of-a-value-for-arbitrary-keys-in-an-object-in-jsdoc
2020-01-13T15:53:46  <Justin_o> as possible examples
2020-01-13T15:54:20  <Justin_o> the example from my code is related to trying to provide some JSDocs for the auxiliary schema, in particular for the preference configuration supplied there
2020-01-13T15:54:52  <Justin_o> and similarly for other options that can be provided to the enactors and panels through the auxiliary schema
2020-01-13T15:54:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2020-01-13T15:57:06  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I did point you at it, but I am wondering if that syntax is actually supported by the JSDocs spec
2020-01-13T15:57:10  <Justin_o> at any rate, I guess if you don't understand what it means, there is something wrong with it
2020-01-13T15:57:20  <Bosmon> I'm not immediately seeing it amongst https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/tags-property
2020-01-13T15:57:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it looks like it's actually typescript and not  JSDocs from what I could tell
2020-01-13T15:58:00  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess it passes our linting at least?
2020-01-13T15:58:14  <Justin_o> I think the general recommendations in stackoverflow are related to visual studio code not complaining about that syntax, but complaining about other options that people have used to specify such things
2020-01-13T15:58:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it does, but not sure we lint the JSDocs
2020-01-13T15:58:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the-t-in-rtf's rules apply some processing to them
2020-01-13T15:58:50  <Bosmon> Try making a mistake : P
2020-01-13T15:58:57  <Bosmon> Like not documenting a function parameter
2020-01-13T15:59:08  <Bosmon> I guess the rules are a lot looser for freeform docs not attached to a function
2020-01-13T15:59:11  <Justin_o> oh right, yes.. those things do get checked
2020-01-13T15:59:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon: right, could be that it doesn't validate the typedef
2020-01-13T15:59:53  <the-t-in-rtf> I think you get a carriage return or so between the /** */ block and the function
2020-01-13T16:00:12  <the-t-in-rtf> before it doesn't consider them as related
2020-01-13T16:01:24  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks, that's good to know.. and would explain why the typedef wouldn't be validated
2020-01-13T16:02:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I think I've put typedefs in their own blocks independently of any function
2020-01-13T16:02:50  <the-t-in-rtf> in the past
2020-01-13T16:04:16  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  that's what I've typically done too. I don't recall getting any validation errors on them, but I might just always be writing them correctly.
2020-01-13T16:04:30  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-json-schema/blob/master/src/js/common/validator.js#L66
2020-01-13T16:04:32  <the-t-in-rtf> there's an example
2020-01-13T16:05:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: another question. I'm looking at this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/AuxBuilder.js#L107 and it appears that the `return false` is an attempt to break out of the `fluid.each`. Do you recall if this is correct? If so I don't believe that you can actually terminate a `fluid.each` call early, and that this is really just a bug.
2020-01-13T16:07:12  <Bosmon> Justin_o - really not sure what that is trying to do at all...
2020-01-13T16:07:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean, it does have the effect of skipping the rest of the code in the block
2020-01-13T16:07:46  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the example. It's interesting you're using {Array<String>} and what I'm seeing in Infusion is {String[]}. Also do you have any examples of cases where you have indeterminate property names? That is where any key/value can be used
2020-01-13T16:08:00  <the-t-in-rtf> <Any>
2020-01-13T16:08:07  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, sorry
2020-01-13T16:08:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it looks like it is dead code to me
2020-01-13T16:08:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess sometimes we just leave it at object
2020-01-13T16:08:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it does skip the rest of the code block, but that would also include the final fluid.set call at the end, which is outside of the fluid.each loop
2020-01-13T16:08:52  <Justin_o> what do you mean by "dead code"
2020-01-13T16:09:10  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean, that this is code which no longer does anything, that has got left behind by some previous incomplete factoring
2020-01-13T16:09:30  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: so you'd write something like @property {Object} <Any>
2020-01-13T16:09:39  <Bosmon> It's what tends to happen when you accumulate a lot of convoluted, poorly documented code which noone clearly understands any more : P
2020-01-13T16:10:26  <the-t-in-rtf> in that case you don't need <Any>
2020-01-13T16:10:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think it is trying to guard against applying the container property to grades that aren't viewComponents

2020-01-13T16:11:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: from what I can tell in the debugger there are two general cases where the function are used, when applying options to sub component definitions and model definitions.. I think for implicit model relays.
2020-01-13T16:11:57  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: oh so you basically just don't name the property?
2020-01-13T16:13:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I don't understand what you're going for yet.
2020-01-13T16:14:06  <the-t-in-rtf> You don't seem to have a name at all in the example you sent
2020-01-13T16:14:16  <the-t-in-rtf> As <Any> is not a real name
2020-01-13T16:15:16  <the-t-in-rtf> If you're trying to say that the object can contain values of any type, that's implied
2020-01-13T16:15:50  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm assuming you'd replace "<Any>" with "options" or whatever the actual name is
2020-01-13T16:19:04  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: the thing is that it's trying to indicate that you can provide bare options for the enactor component. We don't know what those options are though

2020-01-13T16:21:39  <the-t-in-rtf> uh
2020-01-13T16:21:47  <the-t-in-rtf> @property is for object properties?
2020-01-13T16:22:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I think you're trying to express that anything goes within an object?
2020-01-13T16:22:21  <the-t-in-rtf> my point is you step up in the hierarchy and get that for free with the enclosing {Object}
2020-01-13T16:23:04  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: some of the property names are defined, but others aren't. So it's easy to mention the ones that are defined, but I'd like to also capture the fact that more can be added  as well.
2020-01-13T16:23:16  <the-t-in-rtf> I know exactly what you mean
2020-01-13T16:23:27  <the-t-in-rtf> there is syntax for this in JSON Schemas
2020-01-13T16:23:37  <the-t-in-rtf> but I don't know if there is a good equivalent in JSDocs
2020-01-13T16:24:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, I haven't been able to find one either
2020-01-13T16:24:22  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: out of curiosity, how does it look in JSON schema?
2020-01-13T16:24:36  <the-t-in-rtf> look up additionalProperties
2020-01-13T16:24:47  <the-t-in-rtf> it can be "true" for the fact that you allow anything
2020-01-13T16:24:58  <the-t-in-rtf> "false" to indicate that no additional properties are allowed
2020-01-13T16:25:01  <the-t-in-rtf> or a full schema
2020-01-13T16:25:15  <the-t-in-rtf> so, for example, you can just specify things about the namespace used for additional properties
2020-01-13T16:25:41  <the-t-in-rtf> or you can say they all have to have strings as values, you can express a lot
2020-01-13T16:26:02  <Justin_o> ah, I see
2020-01-13T16:26:05  <the-t-in-rtf> by namespace, I just mean that the key has to match some pattern you specify
2020-01-13T16:26:41  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay.. so I guess we could just leave some more information in the description of the typedef instead of trying to put it into an actual property
2020-01-13T16:26:44  <the-t-in-rtf> It's a good impulse to want to express that in your docs, remember that when you are writing schemas for the aux stuff… ;)
2020-01-13T16:26:53  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that seems reasonable to me
2020-01-13T16:27:38  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I guess the only risk is if something tries to use the typedef for validation.. I don't think we'll have that problem per se, but I wonder if some editors may be doing that
2020-01-13T16:28:24  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  :) I was just wonder about the schemas.. I wonder if there is a way to tie them and the JSDocs together

2020-01-13T18:02:17  <Teddy__> okay sounds good
2020-01-13T18:03:22  <clown> Teddy__, I'm getting out the Surface demo machine and getting it set up.  I then need to explore how it might be shared via Zoom.
2020-01-13T18:03:43  <clown> I'll let you know how it goes…
2020-01-13T18:04:46  <Teddy__> okay

2020-01-13T18:17:41  <Justin_o> clown: I guess you could install zoom on the Surface and just screen share from there. Or you could go to the collaboration room and point a camera at it.. I guess it depends what/how you want show things
2020-01-13T18:17:51  <Justin_o> clown: when do you plan on doing the demo, and mind if I sit in?
2020-01-13T18:18:09  <clown1> Justin_o:  Bert suggested I don't need to install anything, but to just use the web based version of Zoom.

2020-01-13T18:19:41  <gmoss> cindyli clown1: if there's an appetite to produce a more polished and/or up-to-date demonstration of Morphic and UIO+, perhaps we could explore that! Avtar has been working on his video chops and I'm certain he could make better title cards than I could :)
2020-01-13T18:19:54  <gmoss> *demonstration video
2020-01-13T18:20:24  <Justin_o> gmoss: not sure.. maybe when we have UIO+ out of beta might be a good time
2020-01-13T18:20:34  <gmoss> Justin_o: that seems reasonable
2020-01-13T18:20:48  <Justin_o> not sure exactly how long that will be though.. probably on the order of months
2020-01-13T18:21:14  <gmoss> Justin_o: we can cross that bridge when we get to it :)

2020-01-13T21:01:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: quick infusion question: if an invoker is set up to call a function but no arguments are explicitly specified, are any passed along  to the function when the invoker is called? specifically wondering about this feller: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/2e487c617e8f57a067a37b9d6aed82fb7a26d87a/src/framework/core/js/DataSource.js#L215
2020-01-13T21:03:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: never mind, sorry, I see they're injected into the component later on by the function called by onRead.impl
2020-01-13T21:13:04  <clown> Teddy__, Justin_o, Pardon the interruption:  I have the Morphic demo machine set up, and figured out how to share a demo using zoom.  But, I see you are still in a meeting.  When does your meeting end?
2020-01-13T21:17:37  <Justin_o> clown: scheduled to end at 4:30pm
2020-01-13T21:17:56  <Justin_o> clown: will you still be around after that, if not maybe we can plan for a time tomorrow?
2020-01-13T21:18:11  <clown> Okay.  I can do a quick demo then, if you like.  But I have to start my exist around 5pm
2020-01-13T21:18:15  <clown> *exit
2020-01-13T21:20:59  <clown> actually a little earlier since I have to pack up and store the demo machine.
2020-01-13T21:22:58  <Justin_o> clown: okay, maybe check in to see if we are actually done at 4:30 and if not, maybe we should push off for later
2020-01-13T21:23:21  <Justin_o> clown: also not sure if Teddy__ is available after the meeting
2020-01-13T21:25:43  <clown> Thanks Justin_o:  FYI, if it's tomorrow, cindyli will do the demo since I'm WFH.  Or, we can wait until Wed. when I'm back.
2020-01-13T21:26:11  <Justin_o> clown: okay, thanks for the heads up.
2020-01-13T21:30:01  <michelled> clown: if you can join us in the standup room ted is available for a demo
2020-01-13T21:30:33  <clown> on my way, michelled
