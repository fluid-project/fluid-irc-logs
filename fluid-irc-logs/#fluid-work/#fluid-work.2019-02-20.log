2019-02-20T13:10:06  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], check this out: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5293
2019-02-20T13:10:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm merging in recent changes to master and cleaning up some stuff in that area.
2019-02-20T13:10:35  <the-t-in-rtf> To me it looks like 0 and 1 are the actual values being stores
2019-02-20T13:10:37  <the-t-in-rtf> stored
2019-02-20T13:10:53  <the-t-in-rtf> which doesn't match this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5133
2019-02-20T13:11:07  <the-t-in-rtf> When I see stuff like that, I've been fixing it to match what gets stored in the registry.
2019-02-20T13:11:17  <the-t-in-rtf> So my question is, what gets stored in the registry in that case?
2019-02-20T13:11:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I can change whichever end is misleading to match.
2019-02-20T13:12:00  <the-t-in-rtf> they might technically both be OK, as 0 evaluates to false, but we should be a bit more specific
2019-02-20T13:17:51  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: you are right there are a few ones of that misleading settings schema in the SR, most of them are because of the conversations we had about "we should expose what it's really stored" and other may simply be typos
2019-02-20T13:17:59  <javjarfer[m]> but a cleanup of those is needed
2019-02-20T13:18:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm going to make them store as 0s and 1s, we should address the underlying issue in the ticket Antranig created
2019-02-20T13:19:03  <the-t-in-rtf> until then IMO it's far safer to store what we save rather than leave it to falsiness or toString() to convert things for us
2019-02-20T13:20:29  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I agree, we should do that,

2019-02-20T14:39:57  <cindyli> the version of this module in package.json:

2019-02-20T14:52:13  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @cindyli.  that's the latest version I see when I run npm info gpii-couchdb-test-harness versions.
2019-02-20T14:53:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I see that the npm landing page is definitely out of date, though.
2019-02-20T14:53:45  <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpii-couchdb-test-harness
2019-02-20T14:54:10  <the-t-in-rtf> looks like it's down to the dev or latest tag
2019-02-20T14:54:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess that one was the full release I had to use to populate the entry on npm
2019-02-20T14:54:32  <the-t-in-rtf> you want the latest dev one, which you should be able to retrieve
2019-02-20T14:54:53  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean that the "public" version was just "public" because I had to create the entry and didn't manually tag it.

2019-02-20T15:34:16  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  do you have a minute?  This is in regards to merging your testing changes into my GPII-3333 branch.
2019-02-20T15:34:29  <clown> it's going pretty well, btw.
2019-02-20T15:34:33  <the-t-in-rtf> cool
2019-02-20T15:34:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm here
2019-02-20T15:35:14  <clown> but, one of my tests involves trying to update a snapset (carla), but the databse is configured such that carla is a 'user' prefs safe.
2019-02-20T15:35:30  <clown> What I'd like is this config:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/86167675313f759032f24c48e8256d3b3b29b705/gpii/node_modules/couchConnector/configs/gpii.couchConnector.config.base.json5
2019-02-20T15:35:44  <clown> but, I'm unsure how to get there.
2019-02-20T15:37:03  <the-t-in-rtf> the db is reset for each test suite, so you just need to pull in "your" data instead.  Let me find a good example of one that uses totally different test data.
2019-02-20T15:37:25  <clown> sounds good.
2019-02-20T15:37:52  <the-t-in-rtf> It's a smidge ugly, but here's an example: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/86167675313f759032f24c48e8256d3b3b29b705/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTests.js#L1582
2019-02-20T15:38:12  <the-t-in-rtf> basically you have to define a new test environment and then make a stub to unpack your test defs and use that environment with them.
2019-02-20T15:38:47  <the-t-in-rtf> if you're using a test environment directly, you don't need the callback yoga
2019-02-20T15:39:13  * clown pondering….
2019-02-20T15:39:50  <the-t-in-rtf> if you link to the test that uses that config, I can help you ponder...
2019-02-20T15:40:25  <clown> what do you mean by "link to the test that uses that config"?  You want a link to my code?
2019-02-20T15:41:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess you were saying you wanted to do something like that
2019-02-20T15:42:09  <the-t-in-rtf> what I mean is, if you have anything checked in that even attempts it, I can help you review it
2019-02-20T15:42:40  <clown> I have something checked that uses the system "out of the box" — I'll show you that…
2019-02-20T15:42:44  <the-t-in-rtf> but the pattern I sent you is the way I did it for the tests that had their own data
2019-02-20T15:42:45  <clown> someplace to start.
2019-02-20T15:42:59  <the-t-in-rtf> the out of the box data should be much much simpler
2019-02-20T15:43:10  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you don't need to define your own little function or environment
2019-02-20T15:43:17  <the-t-in-rtf> but go ahead
2019-02-20T15:43:55  <clown> This is where is starts:  https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/GPII-3333_GPII-3619/tests/platform/cloud/SettingsPutTests.js
2019-02-20T15:44:38  <clown> It's the one at line 33 that doesn't work.
2019-02-20T15:46:33  <clown> and by "out of the box", I mean I'm not doing anything specific to configure the database; I'm just going with what I get running that code.
2019-02-20T15:50:39  * clown notes:  10 min until the APCP meeting.
2019-02-20T15:50:41  <clown> brb
2019-02-20T15:51:50  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, joy, disrupted tests
2019-02-20T15:54:27  <clown> you feel my pain?
2019-02-20T15:57:21  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I'll have to review and dig up a good example of how I handled that
2019-02-20T15:57:36  <the-t-in-rtf> which I can't do in the three minutes before a meeting I'm presenting at.... :|
2019-02-20T15:57:54  <the-t-in-rtf> expect a link during the updates section of the next meeting... ;)

2019-02-20T17:28:31  <the-t-in-rtf> @clown, I think I changed the signature of the disrupted test runner, here's an example: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/cloud/SettingsGetTests.js#L391
2019-02-20T17:28:44  <the-t-in-rtf> you might just need to twiddle your arguments around a bit
2019-02-20T17:29:24  <the-t-in-rtf> Here's the same line from the tests you're working on: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/cloud/SettingsPutTests.js#L260
2019-02-20T17:29:46  <clown> Well, we both changed that signature — that was one of the merge conflicts.
2019-02-20T17:30:14  <clown> Let me try another tact, the-t-in-rtf.
2019-02-20T17:30:18  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, and I rewrote the bits as test sequence steps
2019-02-20T17:30:21  <the-t-in-rtf> which you'll need to do
2019-02-20T17:30:36  <the-t-in-rtf> sure
2019-02-20T17:30:50  <clown> Before your changes, this is what I had to change to get snapsets into the database:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/718/files#diff-9a09cbe02e1a616b46e9ff110b1b1452
2019-02-20T17:31:09  <clown> But, the "PouchTestCaseHolder" is now gone.
2019-02-20T17:31:17  <clown> What replaced this?
2019-02-20T17:31:23  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the first test environment link I sent you much earlier today
2019-02-20T17:31:34  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/86167675313f759032f24c48e8256d3b3b29b705/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTests.js#L1582
2019-02-20T17:31:41  <the-t-in-rtf> that'
2019-02-20T17:31:43  <clown> okay.
2019-02-20T17:31:48  <the-t-in-rtf> that's a test that uses custom data
2019-02-20T17:32:27  <clown> So, I might be able to make an analogous change there.  Analagous to the change in PouchTestCaseHolder..  I'll try that.
2019-02-20T17:32:48  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully, but to use non-standard settings you need to create and mix in an environment grade
2019-02-20T17:33:01  <the-t-in-rtf> at least non-standard couch settings
2019-02-20T17:33:41  <clown> What do you mean by "non-standard settings"?
2019-02-20T17:50:42  <the-t-in-rtf> other data, in this case
2019-02-20T18:08:28  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  well, I found what I needed to change and now my test passes.
2019-02-20T18:08:57  <clown> The analogous change to PouchTestCaseHolder is now in Fixtures.js.
2019-02-20T18:09:20  <clown> The next question is if my change breaks something else.   I'll test that after lunch.
2019-02-20T18:09:26  <clown> or during, even.
2019-02-20T18:24:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect it might.
2019-02-20T18:24:55  <the-t-in-rtf> which is why I shared the pattern for doing stuff with that little overlay
2019-02-20T18:25:06  <the-t-in-rtf> but see where you get, I'll be around tomorrow if you need more help

2019-02-20T19:23:26  <cindyli> sgithens: i feel device reporter needs some rewriting to get around the requirement of the "{request}" argument that is a component having onResponse and onError events - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/deviceReporter/src/DeviceReporter.js#L99. wonder if you had to rewrite this part at calling deviceReporter functions directly.

2019-02-20T20:50:59  <cindyli> Bosmon: i wonder if i should get rid of the http endpoint from deviceReporter completely?
2019-02-20T20:52:38  <cindyli> rather than having device reporter responding to the "suppressHttpEndpoints" flag to hide this endpoint in production config
