2019-11-11T14:36:02  <Bosmon3> You might be glad to know future versions of the framework will be able to guard against problems like this once we make the contents of the model immutable

2019-11-11T15:43:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: last week you asked about the FLUID-6426 "can we determine whether these combined selectors are consumed just by the renderer or whether they are also used for general DOM binding during the lifetime of the component?"
2019-11-11T15:44:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: This is one of the panels that gets rendered as a sub panel in the example. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/examples/framework/preferences/shared/js/panels.js#L58-L101
2019-11-11T15:50:30  <Justin_o> interesting that in that case the we use a selectorToIgnore to block the container of the textfieldslider subcomponent from being handed by the renderer
2019-11-11T15:51:11  <Justin_o> so I'm assuming that the rebased selectors are only consumed by the renderer
2019-11-11T15:53:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: although I don't think we can guarantee that. For example if a theme picker (e.g. contrast preference) was used as a sub panel, it would make use of the dom binder as well. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L760-L774

2019-11-11T16:07:44  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - that's pretty awkward
2019-11-11T16:08:21  <Bosmon3> It suggests that there would be no backward-compatible way of solving the problem, since in the old framework we don't have enough control over the order of instantiation of components
2019-11-11T16:08:58  <Bosmon3> Perhaps there is no alternative to using a new-style "workflow function" just to resolve the race between the composite panel and its children, just before we delete all this stuff....
2019-11-11T16:10:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: what would that entail?
2019-11-11T16:10:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon3:  also, I'm trying to think of an alternative with the current/old framework.
2019-11-11T16:11:51  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - actually it probably would not require that, we could probably do it in the new framework with a fairly ordinary kind of expander that issues a fluid.queryIoCSelector to find its children

2019-11-11T16:12:36  <Bosmon3> If we only had to patch the use of the selectors by the "old renderer" I think it would be fairly easy to just hack it
2019-11-11T16:12:53  <Bosmon3> Well, I suppose we could hack the DOM binder's selectors too, it isn't going to mind : p
2019-11-11T16:13:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I think it already sort of hacks the Dom binder's selectors. we have to reset the Dom binder
2019-11-11T16:13:33  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - that's true, but that only hacks the container, not the selectors : p
2019-11-11T16:13:40  <Bosmon3> But yes, perhaps we should do it this way
2019-11-11T16:13:50  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L145-L175
2019-11-11T16:14:00  <Bosmon3> This set of hacks will only heighten the correct impression that the composite panel system is a place where undesirable things go on that we want to eliminate : p

2019-11-11T16:40:26  <Justin_o> the composite panel system is also very confusing, I'm constantly amazed that it actually works.
2019-11-11T16:40:34  <Justin_o> any improvements to it are more than welcome

2019-11-11T18:16:01  <gmoss> cindyli or Justin_o: would one of you be willing to review my SJRK-286 PR? it would be much appreciated :) or anyone else with fluid-project commit rights, really :) https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/50
2019-11-11T18:22:44  <cindyli> sure, gmoss, i'll review
2019-11-11T18:23:15  <gmoss> thanks cindyli!
2019-11-11T18:26:14  <cindyli> np, gmoss. is it possible for you to fill up the section of "_<add reliable reproduction steps here>_ in the jira - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-286?
2019-11-11T18:26:30  <gmoss> cindyli: sure
2019-11-11T18:27:21  <cindyli> gmoss: it would also be helpful to attach a couple of images that can help with reproducing the problem
2019-11-11T18:27:24  <cindyli> thanks
2019-11-11T18:28:39  <gmoss> cindyli: there are some images that satisfy in the testData directory in my PR, would those be sufficient? the manual tests for the imageBlockEditor show instructions now, too. I can just refer to those in the Jira repro steps, would that work for you?
2019-11-11T18:29:19  <gmoss> otherwise I have to describe how to find or produce such an image
2019-11-11T18:29:35  <gmoss> probably why I never filled that step in ;P
2019-11-11T18:30:41  <cindyli> that's totally fine. thanks, gmoss
2019-11-11T18:33:00  <gmoss> cindyli: I have added reproduction instructions :)
2019-11-11T18:33:26  <gmoss> Thanks again for taking a look, let me know if you need any more detail
2019-11-11T18:36:22  <cindyli> sure. thanks
