2019-07-12T13:05:43  <Bosmon> yanachkov__ - perhaps for your problem there is a way you can invoke the chrome dev tools embedded in electron in order to see how the CSS engine is making its height calculation
2019-07-12T13:06:24  <Bosmon> But as I remember this is rather complex and involves patching some of the code to include some form of hotkey listener to enable them
2019-07-12T13:08:23  <Bosmon> yanachkov__ - it looks like you can use a snippet a bit like this one: https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-make-developer-tools-appear/16232

2019-07-12T15:17:17  <jhernandez> using this defaultSettings.json5 does not harm the reset to std functionality, right?
2019-07-12T15:17:21  <jhernandez> https://paste.gnome.org/pgv0czfdo
2019-07-12T15:19:09  <jhernandez> Kris didn't have time to deal with https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/828f511192ff5cddb5646cbd5c278c60081788e5/testData/defaultSettings/defaultSettings.win32.json5#L9-L11
2019-07-12T15:19:59  <jhernandez> and by using the defaultSettings.json above + a quick change in gpii-app code seems to be working fine
2019-07-12T15:22:09  <cindyli> jhernandez: it should be fine. i will do some testing to confirm

2019-07-12T15:58:02  <cindyli> Bosmon: the long form is like: "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/applications/com\\.microsoft\\.office.word-ribbon"
2019-07-12T15:58:24  <cindyli> the nested form is like:

2019-07-12T16:04:16  <Bosmon> cindyli - I see now, thanks
2019-07-12T16:04:29  <Bosmon> Can the equivalent "long form" for common terms be interpreted by the matchmaker?
2019-07-12T16:07:17  <cindyli> let me try
2019-07-12T16:07:29  <jhernandez> cindyli: well, reset to std is resetting word well this way, but not sure what are the implications for that
2019-07-12T16:09:02  <jhernandez> to give you some background on this, this is the way that gpii-app doesn't gt out of sync when resetting to std with the nested-like term
2019-07-12T16:11:29  <jhernandez> so the quick workaround from kris on this round was to use the format used in https://paste.gnome.org/pgv0czfdo along with this quick fix in gpii-app code
2019-07-12T16:11:33  <jhernandez> https://paste.gnome.org/ptjt3tpjs
2019-07-12T16:12:25  <cindyli> jhernandez: reset to std uses this calculated "defaultSnapshot" (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L284) to reset prefs. from my debugging output, the long form won't produce any output for "com.microsoft.office" solution in this value, while the nested form will
2019-07-12T16:12:43  <jhernandez> and he didn't have the time to take a closer look at it, but it's in our next things to fix
2019-07-12T16:12:54  <jhernandez> cindyli: thanks for the info

2019-07-12T16:14:14  <cindyli> jhernandez: i see, this code https://paste.gnome.org/ptjt3tpjs tries to convert the long form into the nested form. that's good
2019-07-12T16:14:53  <jhernandez> then we should fix gpii-app to deal with the nested  form, because it's only having problems with the office setting

2019-07-12T16:55:42  <jhernandez> cindyli, Bosmon: I just created a patch that "just works"
2019-07-12T16:55:46  <jhernandez> https://paste.gnome.org/pebplym78
2019-07-12T16:56:55  <jhernandez> if the value is an object, then it goes over the settings in that path and adds them in the flavor that gpii-app likes
2019-07-12T16:59:19  <cindyli> i see, gpii-app prefers to have all pref values in objects in the format of {"value": a-pref-value}
2019-07-12T17:00:23  <jhernandez> yup, if I add a second setting to office, I get this output
2019-07-12T17:00:26  <jhernandez> https://paste.gnome.org/pmsrraft8
2019-07-12T17:00:43  <cindyli> ok
2019-07-12T17:00:56  <jhernandez> which I think is what we should do this
2019-07-12T17:01:33  <cindyli> hope one day gpii-app doesn't need to read defaultSettings.json5 directly
2019-07-12T17:02:32  <jhernandez> yes, I guess that at some point it'll just receive the settings from the PSP channel, thanks to this https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/803 and some adjustments in gpii-app
2019-07-12T17:02:40  <jhernandez> maybe next week?
2019-07-12T17:02:44  <jhernandez> :)

2019-07-12T17:04:00  <jhernandez> okay, then I'll create a PR with this workaround and ship it into my building branch for today's installer

2019-07-12T19:50:19  <sgithens> I have finally got the SPI settings working in the snapshotter
2019-07-12T19:50:34  <sgithens> it ended up taking me about 2 solid focused days
2019-07-12T19:50:55  <Bosmon> sgithens - what difficulties have you encountered?
2019-07-12T19:50:59  <sgithens> well
2019-07-12T19:52:39  <sgithens> it's just the extra registry path information is kept in the capabilitiesTransforms, rather than the supported settings. To see if this was the correct problem, I sort of manually added the material back in. The correct way to fix it... there must just be an extra transform in the chain that happens during the entire key-in-out process, that you need apply before calling these functions
2019-07-12T19:53:08  <sgithens> I need to pull that out, and maybe put a comment on the functions saying you need to run that to get the proper final payload that the function requires
2019-07-12T19:53:16  <sgithens> well, I need to find it
2019-07-12T19:53:25  <sgithens> but either way, I just captured all the SPI settings
2019-07-12T19:53:35  <sgithens> so I know it works
2019-07-12T19:55:47  <sgithens> I meticously set my gpii-app VM next to my gpii-windows VM and watched the payloads go through side by side
2019-07-12T19:56:24  <sgithens> there is also some insane bug with VitualBox at the moment, which causes my kernel to freeze and my computer to turn off instantly sometimes
2019-07-12T19:56:38  <sgithens> but I'm afraid to upgrade it until I finish this build for next week
