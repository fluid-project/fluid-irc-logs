2020-07-28T11:30:39  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: reminder that the 2nd evaluation for GSoC is due at the end of the week.
2020-07-28T11:30:50  <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2020-07-28T11:31:09  <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to ask about signing up for a design crit next week or the week after.
2020-07-28T11:31:19  <the-t-in-rtf> You said that was Jonathan?
2020-07-28T11:32:23  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yes, jhung would be the best to talk to about that. We'll be using the time slot (probably next week, although waiting on confirmation of availability) for a community meeting about accessible survey tools.
2020-07-28T11:32:44  <Justin_o> so I'm not sure yet which one will be available, but we'll probably know by tomorrow or thursday
2020-07-28T11:32:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I was going to ask if we could get an earlier time slot for the week after.
2020-07-28T11:32:55  <the-t-in-rtf> or next week depending.
2020-07-28T11:33:02  <Justin_o> ah, earlier in the day?
2020-07-28T11:33:04  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2020-07-28T11:33:18  <the-t-in-rtf> The presenter is 9.5 hours ahead of you, and I'm 6.
2020-07-28T11:33:25  <Justin_o> we have our planning meeting at 11:30 so it would have to finish up by then
2020-07-28T11:33:31  <the-t-in-rtf> no worries
2020-07-28T11:33:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I was thinking like 10:00 CET
2020-07-28T11:34:04  <Justin_o> did you mean 10 ET
2020-07-28T11:34:35  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2020-07-28T11:34:43  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, yes
2020-07-28T11:34:46  <the-t-in-rtf> 16:00 CET
2020-07-28T11:35:09  <the-t-in-rtf> 10:00 your time
2020-07-28T11:36:37  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I think that would be possible, probably on the week that doesn't have the community meeting, but we should double check with jhung. He'll probably be online in an hour or two
2020-07-28T11:36:55  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds good
2020-07-28T12:35:49  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I'm noticing an error when trying to run some tests in the storytelling tool. It's complaining about rimraf being missing and looks like it's related to fluid-pouchdb
2020-07-28T12:36:23  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: if I'm understanding things correctly, fluid-pouchdb declares it as a devDependency https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-pouchdb/blob/da22b15f06ce93c2464965b16fa2ddac90cd2d74/package.json#L42
2020-07-28T12:36:51  <Justin_o> but uses it in the src file https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-pouchdb/blob/master/src/js/timelyRimraf.js#L10
2020-07-28T12:39:41  <Justin_o> And that file is referenced from the index.js file https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-pouchdb/blob/master/index.js#L7
2020-07-28T12:47:54  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I've filed a bug for this https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-pouchdb/issues/27
2020-07-28T13:53:48  <the-t-in-rtf> cool, should be easy to address.
2020-07-28T14:21:31  <Justin_o> gmoss: I've been looking into the issue with the markdown-it dependency. I think the best solution will be to just declare it as a dependency directly. It's used directly in the theme files ( https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/c24654b4de6d8f38707a79c3b0cba957e80f0b7e/themes/base/storyBrowse.html#L15 ).
2020-07-28T14:28:36  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-07-28T14:52:51  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah I agree, it's not the most elegant solution, but it works and we already do this with handlebars
2020-07-28T14:54:07  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks.. I've pushed up the changes to my branch.
2020-07-28T14:54:45  <gmoss> Justin_o: great, I'll give it a test after planning
2020-07-28T15:01:45  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-07-28T15:21:48  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hello, are you available for a testem question?
2020-07-28T15:54:49  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, go ahead.  I may have to punt and do some research, but not harm in asking.
2020-07-28T15:55:31  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks.. I'm getting "No coverage data, firing Testem callback immediately..."
2020-07-28T15:55:50  <Justin_o> Which I believe is being triggered by each of the browser tests.
2020-07-28T15:56:07  <Justin_o> any idea what the usual cause is for this
2020-07-28T15:56:25  <Justin_o> I'm assuming I must have misconfigured something or maybe I'm missing a dependency
2020-07-28T15:56:39  <Justin_o> the coverageSender and testem.js are linked in the test files though
2020-07-28T16:17:02  <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, the-t-in-rtf is hoping to schedule a Design Crit related to the GSoC project he is mentoring.
2020-07-28T16:17:37  <the-t-in-rtf> well, one cause would simply be running testem against the uninstrumented code
2020-07-28T16:17:56  <the-t-in-rtf> any easy way to confirm is simply to use testem in "non CI" mode and open it in your browser
2020-07-28T16:18:02  <the-t-in-rtf> if you see the instrumented code, something else is happening
2020-07-28T16:18:16  <Justin_o> how do I do that?
2020-07-28T16:18:34  <the-t-in-rtf> node node_modules/testem/testem.js --file tests/testem.js
2020-07-28T16:18:43  <the-t-in-rtf> it will tell you what port it's running on
2020-07-28T16:18:46  <the-t-in-rtf> open that in a browser
2020-07-28T16:19:10  <the-t-in-rtf> if you look at the npm script, you just leave off the "ci" part
2020-07-28T16:19:15  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: assuming that's the problem, it would be an issue with my configuration in the testem.js file?
2020-07-28T16:19:24  <the-t-in-rtf> possibly yes
2020-07-28T16:19:47  <the-t-in-rtf> in fact it's the first thing I would check if something similar happened to me
2020-07-28T16:19:58  <the-t-in-rtf> happy to look at your config if you've got a branch checked in.
2020-07-28T16:20:33  <jhung> Justin_o, the-t-in-rtf - ok sounds good. Did you have a date in mind for the crit?
2020-07-28T16:22:25  <Justin_o> jhung: the crit will also need to be at an earlier time, he's hoping for 10am ET.
2020-07-28T16:23:06  <jhung> So 10am ET Tuesday Aug 4 Justin_o?
2020-07-28T16:24:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: unsurprisingly, adding markdown-it to the deps has solved the issue I encountered yesterday. I'm going to leave a comment on the PR indicating that I think it's good to merge
2020-07-28T16:25:58  <Justin_o> jhung: I think the wecount community meeting about the accessible surveys will happen that day, so might be better to move it to the following week
2020-07-28T16:26:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-07-28T16:26:38  <jhung> Justin_o ok. I'll put it on the calendar and send out the emails as the date gets closer.
2020-07-28T16:27:40  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the help, here is branch with the testem work in progress https://github.com/jobara/sjrk-story-telling/tree/SJRK-122
2020-07-28T16:28:09  <Justin_o> please note that vagrant isn't setup to work yet, so you'll have to run all the tests on the host.
2020-07-28T16:28:46  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, and we should double check with the-t-in-rtf that the time and date works.
2020-07-28T16:28:51  <the-t-in-rtf> so, nesting deeply like that is not for the faint of heart
2020-07-28T16:29:12  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully as long as you run it from the root of the repo, you're fine
2020-07-28T16:29:27  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: you mean the testem.js file?
2020-07-28T16:29:28  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhung, that time is great.
2020-07-28T16:29:30  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2020-07-28T16:29:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to do funny stuff wrt the working dir for the tests in the package itself, although probably "it's fine"
2020-07-28T16:29:56  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I guess I could move it up higher, it just fit more with those specific tests.
2020-07-28T16:29:57  <the-t-in-rtf> just a moment
2020-07-28T16:30:06  <Justin_o> okay
2020-07-28T16:34:05  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, two things about the config.
2020-07-28T16:34:17  <the-t-in-rtf> First, I had to disable your launch block to avoid having two browsers launch immediately
2020-07-28T16:34:22  <the-t-in-rtf> not sure if that behaviour has changed
2020-07-28T16:34:25  <the-t-in-rtf> but in any case, I was correct
2020-07-28T16:34:41  <the-t-in-rtf> change your paths to start with a slash and it should resolve it, just a moment and I'll confirm
2020-07-28T16:35:55  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, or maybe it's the path in the script tags that's wrong
2020-07-28T16:38:57  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I was able to get it working if I used ../tests instead of tests, and there's coverage data, but then it never completes the run.
2020-07-28T16:42:23  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, my gut feel was correct
2020-07-28T16:42:33  <the-t-in-rtf> your tests work unaltered if you simply move them up a directory
2020-07-28T16:42:42  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. tests/testem.json instead of tests/ui/testem.json
2020-07-28T16:42:47  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o
2020-07-28T16:43:53  <the-t-in-rtf> you'll also need to update your script definition in package.json
2020-07-28T16:45:39  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for looking into that for me. I'll make those changes.
2020-07-28T16:46:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to bypass your node tests to get a full run to work to confirm the coverage reporting working.
2020-07-28T16:46:09  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume you knew about that.
2020-07-28T16:46:38  <the-t-in-rtf> Feel free to put in a ticket against fluid-testem, "testem.js behaves oddly if stored in a deep test directory" or something
2020-07-28T16:46:47  <the-t-in-rtf> dang
2020-07-28T16:46:50  <the-t-in-rtf> still didn't work
2020-07-28T16:46:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I saw it sending the reporting data
2020-07-28T16:47:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll have to look at it tomorrow
2020-07-28T16:52:37  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhung, I assume you can send an invite with the connection details or announce it on the list?
2020-07-28T17:52:49  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-07-28T17:54:03  <jhung> the-t-in-rtf sorry I stepped away for a bit. Yes. As the date gets closer, I'll ask you for a description of the crit, and I'll send emails / invites to the mailing lists.
2020-07-28T17:54:15  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds good
2020-07-28T18:00:38  <jhung> gmoss or Justin_o - do either of you have a moment to help me with the Floe PR?
2020-07-28T18:00:53  <Justin_o> jhung: we're both in a Storytelling meeting at the moment
2020-07-28T18:01:00  <jhung> ah ok no prob.
2020-07-28T18:42:50  <Justin_o> jhung: I can chat in a couple minutes
2020-07-28T18:45:16  <jhung> Justin_o ok. Ping me when you're free.
2020-07-28T18:45:39  <Justin_o> jhung: I'm free now
2020-07-28T18:45:54  <jhung> ok. Standup room Justin_o ?
2020-07-28T18:46:01  <Justin_o> sure
2020-07-28T18:46:35  <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2020-07-28T19:15:17  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: sorry, was in a couple meetings and just seeing your follow up messages. I'll try to poke around a bit more today and will follow up with you tomorrow.
2020-07-28T19:22:52  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, I have a little time set aside in the morning to poke around as well
2020-07-28T19:25:21  <Justin_o> thanks for the help
2020-07-28T19:30:37  <gmoss> Justin_o: are you basing your SJRK-122 work off your SJRK-370 branch or off upstream master?
2020-07-28T19:30:51  <Justin_o> gmoss: off SJRK-370
2020-07-28T19:31:37  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay great :)
