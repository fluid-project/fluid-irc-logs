2018-12-19T15:16:00  <javjarfer[m]> that's great, I will be doing it for all the stuff that is already in and also for the ones coming

2018-12-19T17:14:55  <Justin_o> haha, yes, i think there is a line in the file about that
2018-12-19T17:15:09  <Bosmon> In practice I've managed to salvage much more than I expected
2018-12-19T17:15:34  <Bosmon> Given that things will survive with the names fluid.fetchResources and fluid.resourceLoader which still satisfy the same ostensible APIs
2018-12-19T17:15:40  <Bosmon> At least to the extent we published any : P

2018-12-19T19:10:16  <Justin_o> gmoss: which branch would you like me to try
2018-12-19T19:25:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, to a certain extent : P
2018-12-19T19:25:54  <Bosmon> Other than, of course, the everything that will need to be thrown away
2018-12-19T19:26:15  <Bosmon> It just means, I guess, that we will be throwing away slightly fewer things that are in our minds : P
2018-12-19T19:28:00  <Justin_o> haha. okay.. will this change how the language bundle locales are resolved?
2018-12-19T19:30:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, i have a context awareness question. do all the checks run or only the first that passes?
2018-12-19T19:30:52  <Bosmon> Justin_o - locales should resolve in the same way - although I decided to make that change on priority of "defaultLocale" that I was floating with gmoss and waharnum the other day
2018-12-19T19:31:09  <Bosmon> it doesn't seem like there was anything other than pure accident behind the original order
2018-12-19T19:31:16  <Bosmon> As I recall a lot of this code was written pretty hurriedly in 2008
2018-12-19T19:31:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o - as for contextAwareness, what do you mean by "run"? : P
2018-12-19T19:32:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for the explanation about the locales.
2018-12-19T19:32:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  for the contextawareness i'll tell you want i'm trying to do. At least for the case where we change the localization by changing the URL, I don't want that to run in the separate panel. Which has it's own enhancer and copies over all of the enactors.
2018-12-19T19:33:05  <Justin_o> So i want to say, if you're running in the panel, don't try to change the URL.
2018-12-19T19:33:31  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/H3SCjEwt/
2018-12-19T19:34:12  <Justin_o> However, I'd like to take out the no-op grade and move the modelListener to be part of the urlPathLocale grade instead.
2018-12-19T19:34:28  <Justin_o> however, I'm not sure what to do with the case for the panel
2018-12-19T19:35:11  <Justin_o> i basically don't want the contextCheck for urlPath to pass.. although it will because it will still have the same localizationScheme option passed in
2018-12-19T19:35:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess I'll give you the advice I gave gmoss the other day, and advise to get rid of all of this invoker, get and set 1990s style stuff in favour of putting this material in a model
2018-12-19T19:35:41  <Bosmon> At least as far as "localization.urlPathLocale" goes
2018-12-19T19:36:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure i'm completely following. So the Lang itself is in the model.
2018-12-19T19:36:45  <Bosmon> Your "urlPathLocale.changeLocale" is an unhealthy mixture of state lensing and imperative stuff
2018-12-19T19:37:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah so you'd want all the "options" from that grade to be in the model?
2018-12-19T19:37:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the thing called "URLPathname" should also be in the model
2018-12-19T19:38:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. interesting.. that is pulled from the window location actually
2018-12-19T19:38:25  <Bosmon> Justin_o - even more reason to modelise it :)
2018-12-19T19:38:38  <Justin_o> i suppose we could add it onCreate
2018-12-19T19:38:58  <Justin_o> the get and set methods were really just added to support testing
2018-12-19T19:39:15  <Justin_o> because we can't actually change the url in the test
2018-12-19T19:39:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - see my previous response : P
2018-12-19T19:44:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it would still have to call location.pathname underneath to get/set the url. We'd still have to abstract it in some way so that we could mock out that part in the tests. Even as a model value.
2018-12-19T19:45:07  <Justin_o> I guess it depends on how the refactoring goes if those points of access may be easier to mock.
2018-12-19T19:45:39  <Justin_o> for example i suppose the get would only be called once and as part of an onCreate listener or something, so this could be replaced.
2018-12-19T19:49:21  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine you would put the modelListeners which bind to this value in their own grade
2018-12-19T19:49:43  <Bosmon> You might like to think of this activity as analogous to an "enactor"
2018-12-19T19:49:51  <Bosmon> Or any other thing which "materializes" a model value
2018-12-19T19:52:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this seems reasonable. So the urlPathLocale grade would contain a modelListener for lang that modifies that urlPath model value (that it also contributes). The urlPath would initially be set by an onCreate event, and the location.pathname would be set when the urlPath changes; making use of a modelListener.
2018-12-19T19:52:49  <Justin_o> all this would come from the urlPathLocate grade
2018-12-19T19:53:00  <Justin_o> and the langMap would be there too
2018-12-19T19:54:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: still not sure how to best handle not running this in the panel though
2018-12-19T19:54:52  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-svqplesgecckdlmq> has joined #fluid-work
2018-12-19T19:56:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: sorry we were out to lunch (hah). SJRK-91 is the branch in question
2018-12-19T19:57:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I think I didn't quite grasp the "not running it in the panel" business
2018-12-19T20:02:41  <Justin_o> gmoss: do i just need to npm install that branch and open the from my web server?
2018-12-19T20:02:47  <gmoss> yep
2018-12-19T20:02:49  <gmoss> should work
2018-12-19T20:02:57  <gmoss> Justin_o:
2018-12-19T20:02:59  <gmoss> ^
2018-12-19T20:03:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the issue there is that we don't want to change the URL in the separated panel based on locale. The prefs framework already handles the localization there with the message bundles, if the URL in the iframe is changed, it will get a 404
2018-12-19T20:03:31  <Justin_o> so we don't want to run the enactor there
2018-12-19T20:04:19  <Justin_o> but right now the prefs framework is setup to copy over all enactors to the enhancer that is run in the panel. Ideally we'd have a way to filter this or something because don't want/need all of the enactors to run there. Another example would be Table of Contents, but at the moment we just hide the result of it.
2018-12-19T20:04:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sounds like ContextAwareness is needed here too
2018-12-19T20:05:09  <Bosmon> The panel's Infusion context would have a different root grade applied to it than the main page
2018-12-19T20:05:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, want to use contextAwarness for this too.. i've tried that so far with inPanel check that is there now
2018-12-19T20:05:57  <Bosmon> Ah ok
2018-12-19T20:06:03  <Justin_o> but i thought there was probably a better approach
2018-12-19T20:06:20  <Justin_o> hmm.. didn't know there was a different root grade, i added in an option instead
2018-12-19T20:07:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I meant one of the flags that are created by APIs like this one: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ContextAwareness.html#making-contexts-visible-and-removing-them-with-fluidcontextawaremakechecks-and-fluidcontextawareforgetchecks
2018-12-19T20:07:19  <Bosmon> I imagine you don't want to be responsible for routing this option to every possible consumer of it
2018-12-19T20:11:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon: you're suggesting calling this in the  iframe for the panel?
2018-12-19T20:11:44  <Justin_o> and if so, would that work because there isn't an instance of fluid in the panel. All the work sort of happens from the parent and takes place in the iframe
2018-12-19T20:12:40  <Bosmon> bryan_ - congrats on the great work - are you ok to confer with stegru on strategies for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3596 ?
2018-12-19T20:13:06  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, so in that case I'm a bit puzzled by "the prefs framework is setup to copy over all enactors to the enhancer that is run in the panel"
2018-12-19T20:13:12  <Bosmon> How does it do this without an Infusion there?
2018-12-19T20:13:41  <Bosmon> Forgive me if I have forgotten these incredibly obvious details of how the prefs framework works, it's been a while since I looked at that impl : P
2018-12-19T20:15:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm pretty sure it all works on some ancient magic. I routinely can't remember how any of this works either ;)
2018-12-19T20:15:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.js#L119-L139
2018-12-19T20:16:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh yes, I see
2018-12-19T20:17:04  <Bosmon> OK, well the checks would then be entered as children of this iframeRenderer then, rather than at the global component tree root
2018-12-19T20:17:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so we check if there is an iframeRenderer parent
2018-12-19T20:20:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, well I guess that could do
2018-12-19T20:21:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  so what's the appropriate way to set this up. So that in the panel it doesn't add the urlPath grade. I was finding that that check would also pass because the localizationScheme option is passed along to the enhancer in the iframe
2018-12-19T20:24:02  <Bosmon> Justin_o - Yes, these docs really aren't clear are they
2018-12-19T20:25:50  <Bosmon> Justin_o - but yes, indeed the model is that only one of these checks is selected - somehow the docs are not completely clear on this point
2018-12-19T20:26:29  <Bosmon> I think the reason that your impl looks odd is that the semantic functions of the checks are not really comparable
2018-12-19T20:26:42  <Bosmon> "inPanel" isn't really a natural peer for "urlPath"
2018-12-19T20:28:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess ideally i'd like to get rid of the no-op version completely
2018-12-19T20:28:38  <Bosmon> But I think what you've written is probably the best expression in the current ContextAwareness system of "apply the urlPathLocale grade if it has been asked for via the localizationScheme and we are NOT in an iframe"
2018-12-19T20:28:55  <Bosmon> But you can certainly get rid of the no-op
2018-12-19T20:29:23  <Bosmon> Since once you modelise this, you will just move the listener definition into the "urlPathLocale" grade
2018-12-19T20:29:38  <Bosmon> You will still need a block in contextAwareness though - it will just output no grades
2018-12-19T20:30:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. so i'll still the check but it will only have the contextValue
2018-12-19T20:30:26  <Justin_o> ?
2018-12-19T20:30:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, so, why don't you just axe the generic modelListener at line 51
2018-12-19T20:31:04  <Bosmon> And just replace it with a specific one in the urlPathLocale grade, and also axe the invoker that it references
2018-12-19T20:31:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, was planning to do that with the refactoring.. i'd want the base grade to be pretty much just a bare enactor that has a model and context awareness
2018-12-19T20:31:36  <Bosmon> Always look for avenues for getting rid of invokers and replacing them with listeners, and always look for avenues for getting rid of both invokers and listeners and replacing them with stuff in models : P
2018-12-19T20:32:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we will also have one case where we just make use of this enactor through the global instance (resolveRoot). The use case for this is when there are other components on the page that will localize things. E.g. in the story telling tool that gmoss is working on.
2018-12-19T20:32:37  <Justin_o> in that case there will be no localizationScheme and the bare enactor will just be used to setup a model relay in the other compents
2018-12-19T20:33:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  model > listener > invoker
2018-12-19T20:33:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2018-12-19T20:33:20  <Bosmon> That sounds idea, if it is workable
2018-12-19T20:35:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we'll see, after i get this cleaned up I'm going to pass it along to gmoss to try in the story telling tool
2018-12-19T20:35:12  <gmoss> :)
2018-12-19T20:35:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome
2018-12-19T20:35:29  <Bosmon> Well I'm glad I've given the two of you consistent advice, at least
2018-12-19T20:35:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) thanks for that
2018-12-19T20:35:42  <Bosmon> Since as it seems, he had a bunch of invokers chained off a locale change event as well
2018-12-19T20:36:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  also can you think of any other ways that someone would want to enact a localization change. gmoss and I thought of 1) url path 2) query parameter 3) model relay
2018-12-19T20:36:51  <Justin_o> i haven't implemented 2 yet, will do that after making changes for what we talked about today
2018-12-19T20:37:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, if it's in a model, you've done all you need

2018-12-19T20:41:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - speaking of ancient forgotten impls I just ran into this: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L468
2018-12-19T20:41:45  <Bosmon> The things we did in the absence of a renderer ......................
2018-12-19T20:43:18  <Justin_o> that's another big that i'm amazed actually works the who sub panel system really. but that stuff hasn't been exercised too much, outside of some examples. It used to be used in the PCP i think; which i suppose is all gone now.
2018-12-19T20:49:26  <Justin_o> gmoss: tried to run your SJRK-91 branch and am getting a bunch of errors related to the template
2018-12-19T20:49:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: "Assertion failure - check console for more details: Can't find template 'templateName'..."
2018-12-19T20:49:59  <gmoss> hmm
2018-12-19T20:50:43  <gmoss> can you send me the full error message, please? Justin_o
2018-12-19T20:51:16  <Justin_o> gmoss: that was the full message even the ... was part of it
2018-12-19T20:51:30  <Justin_o> gmoss: here's the stack
2018-12-19T20:51:40  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/n0o921hS/
2018-12-19T20:55:00  <gmoss> Justin_o: weird... are there any 404's in the network tab?
2018-12-19T20:55:20  <gmoss> maybe your larger server setup isn't playing nice, it could be a pathing issue
2018-12-19T20:55:26  <Justin_o> there are a lot of 404 errors in the console
2018-12-19T20:55:34  <gmoss> i.e. it's expecting to start from site root and you're hosting from a subdir
2018-12-19T20:55:47  <gmoss> this is a good limitation to overcome, though
2018-12-19T20:56:03  <Justin_o> i thought it was just the localized messages but i scrolled up now and it seems there are 404 for templates too
2018-12-19T20:56:22  <Justin_o> also for http://localhost:8888/src/karisma/templates/karisma-menu.handlebars
2018-12-19T20:56:43  <Justin_o> actually there are other karisma handlebars files with 404 errors
2018-12-19T20:57:10  <gmoss> right, i bet they're called from "/src/..."
2018-12-19T20:57:51  <gmoss> which on your machine would fail, since it should be "/sjrk-story-telling/src/..."
2018-12-19T20:58:03  <Justin_o> yep that's right
2018-12-19T20:58:40  <gmoss> I've seen this issue many times over the years haha... it's especially tricky in .Net land. can't believe I let it slip by me
2018-12-19T21:00:08  <gmoss> Justin_o: I guess we should file a Jira and fix this at some point
2018-12-19T21:01:34  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes.. how is your server setup
2018-12-19T21:01:42  <Justin_o> i'm curious to know the difference
2018-12-19T21:02:16  <gmoss> I run browsersync from within the repo folder, whereas you're running your server from one level up where you can access several "sites"
2018-12-19T21:02:29  <gmoss> so it's really just a matter of what site root is

2018-12-19T21:02:47  <gmoss> ideally the files should be relative across the board, not pinned to site root

2018-12-19T21:04:42  <bryan_> Bosmon: thanks, yeah I'll connect with stegru to see what we can come up with
2018-12-19T21:05:52  <Justin_o> gmoss: makes sense
2018-12-19T21:06:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i guess i'm still going to to need to have wrappers for location.pathname to set and get the value because it's a setter/getter property
2018-12-19T21:07:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, when you say "wrappers"
2018-12-19T21:07:51  <Bosmon> I imagine you mean.... model listeners : P
2018-12-19T21:08:42  <Justin_o> i guess i mean some stick them in a function that gets called as a modelListener.. does that make sense
2018-12-19T21:09:19  <Justin_o> i was hoping to use it directly, but i don't think the declarative this-ism supports those types of properties, or maybe i'm wrong
2018-12-19T21:10:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - A wrapper function will be fine
2018-12-19T21:12:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)

2018-12-19T21:50:18  <stegru> bryan_, I had a quick look at the coverage the other day, and I think most of the red can be moved into their own functions, and tested in isolation (rather than mocking the world and its dog)

2018-12-19T21:51:18  <stegru> the enumerate windows will need a real window - I havae something in mind, but let's get it into a function first

2018-12-19T21:52:38  <bryan_> Hehehe, mock the world
2018-12-19T21:53:33  <bryan_> So is there a ticket to reactor into separate functions?
2018-12-19T21:54:05  <stegru> well, you can do it under the existing one if you like
2018-12-19T21:54:20  <stegru> unless you get paid by the ticket - then fill your boots

2018-12-19T22:14:34  <bryan_> Ok I'll do as much as I can in that same ticket
