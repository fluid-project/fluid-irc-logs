2018-11-13T12:22:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello... I was just about to submit a PR for the syllabification preference in Infusion yesterday, but did some testing and found that it is running slow in Safari. I did some investigation and and it looks like the promises are taking an increasing amount of time to return. In safari the last one takes over 6s. Most of these promises are created from fluid.promise.follow as the page is all in the same language so
2018-11-13T12:22:36  <Justin_o> uses the same hyphenator. We only inject that once, so the only real asynchronous promise takes about 90ms.
2018-11-13T12:22:57  <Justin_o> I wonder if you have any thoughts about this?
2018-11-13T12:25:36  *** stegru <stegru!~ste@cpc120296-warr7-2-0-cust79.1-1.cable.virginm.net> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2018-11-13T12:26:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - no thoughts about what could take 6 seconds, no
2018-11-13T12:26:48  <Bosmon> Have you created perhaps a million promises?
2018-11-13T12:26:56  <Justin_o> in chrome it takes increasingly longer too, but it only gets up to just over 1s
2018-11-13T12:27:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: probably yes
2018-11-13T12:27:10  <Justin_o> well not a million, but a lot
2018-11-13T12:27:16  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I recommend not doing that :)
2018-11-13T12:27:37  <Justin_o> would it be better to share the promise instead of using follows?
2018-11-13T12:27:56  <Bosmon> yes
2018-11-13T12:28:06  <Bosmon> Or at least to only create a fresh promise when there is a fresh asynchronous operation

2018-11-13T13:37:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so things are still taking about 6s to run even with sharing the promise. I think the issue is that everything is happening synchronously. so the promise resolves then the work to do the syllabification for the given text node happens, then the promise resolves again for the text node and we syllabify that one, and so on and so on
2018-11-13T13:39:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I thought it unlikely you had really created 1 million promises
2018-11-13T13:39:55  <Justin_o> we go text node by text node so that we can 1) get the correct language for each node as a page may comprise of more than one language 2) to be able to easily inject the separator
2018-11-13T13:40:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep, so with smaller page contents it will be faster and longer, slower.. etc.
2018-11-13T13:41:02  <Bosmon> It sounds like you may have to follow a hybrid approach where you interate over the page multiple times
2018-11-13T13:44:03  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.177.167> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2018-11-13T13:44:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean, one pass to collect all of the text nodes, and another pass to update them..
2018-11-13T13:44:30  <Bosmon> Justin_o - something like that, yes
2018-11-13T13:44:36  <Bosmon> I was imagining one pass to collect all the languages
2018-11-13T13:44:39  <Justin_o> i guess that sort of happens because of the promises to create the hyphenators
2018-11-13T13:44:42  <Bosmon> And then another pass to syllabify all of them
2018-11-13T13:44:43  <Justin_o> oh

2018-11-13T13:46:01  <Justin_o> well i guess that might still sort of already happen.. when i console log, all of the logs for the text and hyphenator creation happens at the top.. and the syllabification and waiting for the the hyphenator promises all happen together at the bottom
2018-11-13T13:46:25  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, but that doesn't mean that the performance impact will be the same
2018-11-13T13:47:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you're thinking.. analyze the content first for example search for all the lang attributes and instantiate the relevant hyphenators. Then parse the textnodes and apply the syllabification?
2018-11-13T13:47:45  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2018-11-13T13:48:05  <Justin_o> okay, i'll look into that

2018-11-13T14:12:52  <Bosmon> Shouldn't make too much of a difference

2018-11-13T14:14:37  <Bosmon> A fluid.log before and after this line would be interesting to see what the cost of the actual hypenation is
2018-11-13T14:14:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i got rid of that one in my working copy, as per your previous suggestion. I also made another small change to make sure that i don't try to hyphenate whitespace only strings.. which shaved off a few executions.
2018-11-13T14:16:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: from my working copy this is what the logging code for that spot looks like
2018-11-13T14:16:22  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/DdrXOjr6/
2018-11-13T14:16:45  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2018-11-13T14:16:49  <Justin_o> and that is what is outputting most of the logs in the previous paste
2018-11-13T14:16:57  <Bosmon> So it seems reasonable that the vast majority of the time is actually spent in the library
2018-11-13T14:17:02  <Bosmon> Perhaps it is just a really terrible library
2018-11-13T14:17:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm puzzled about the name of the library
2018-11-13T14:18:04  <Bosmon> In your research notes you say it is named "hypher"
2018-11-13T14:18:24  <Bosmon> But what is included as a dev dependency is named "hyphen"
2018-11-13T14:19:28  <Bosmon> Perhaps you changed your mind after this evaluation?

2018-11-13T14:37:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I just did a test in the console in Safari. I took the entire text content from the components container.  which is probably most/everything on the page. In this way i syllabified all of the content at once and it took about 8s
2018-11-13T14:37:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so yah, i guess that is probably as good as we'll get from this library :(
2018-11-13T14:38:00  <Justin_o> rather what we have now is probably as good as we'll get
2018-11-13T14:38:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - seems entirely inadequate
2018-11-13T14:38:33  <Bosmon> The user isn't going to be willing to pay 8s in CPU time to syllabify a modest-sized page
2018-11-13T14:38:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it works much faster everywhere else though
2018-11-13T14:38:38  <Justin_o> that is, other than safari
2018-11-13T14:39:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it's probably faster with the console not open, but it's still going to be slow
2018-11-13T14:40:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i was thinking of using a web workers but 1) haven't used them before so not sure how the dependencies and script injection would work 2) the overhead of the messaging may negate any improvements anyways 3) if the workers all run in the same thread it won't help anyways
2018-11-13T14:41:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i guess i'll try to update my test page that compared accuracies to also calculate execution time
2018-11-13T14:46:27  <Bosmon> Justin_o - perhaps you could extend your test page at https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/infusion/FLUID-6240-syllables/demos/syllables/index.html to take a few benchmarks
2018-11-13T14:48:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, looking at that now to at least calculate the execution time for them.

2018-11-13T16:02:54  <cindyli> georgitodorov: just saw the discussion. not sure if you've figured out. if "{that}.options.siteConfig.qssScaleFactor" is expected to be resolved from the source component where this distributeOptions block belongs to, replace "record" to "source" should solve the problem

2018-11-13T16:37:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the en-US pattern for hyper https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns/blob/master/dist/browser/en-us.js and for hy-phen https://github.com/ytiurin/hyphen/blob/master/patterns/en-us.js

2018-11-13T16:42:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so we could fork their pattern en-us pattern library, but i'm not at this point sure of how exactly to change it to make it better
2018-11-13T16:43:26  <Justin_o> i can't do a direct swap because you can see that both pattern files add in information that is specific to the libraries using them.

2018-11-13T16:45:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, it sounds better to have a library which is 38x faster and 5% less accurate, which we could then table improvements in a future release
