2020-03-18T12:26:30  <akhillll9096> @Justin_o: @gmoss  Also, will we be working on the build.fluidproject.org?
2020-03-18T12:26:49  <akhillll9096> 12:27 PM <akhillll9096> Sir, for the migration project - do we follow the same design guidelines, that the website currently has or will there be a new implementation that will be followed?
2020-03-18T12:29:07  <Justin_o> akhillll9096: build.fluidproject.org is a separate site, at least for now. That might change, but not sure if it would be included with the fluidproject site or not. Maybe colinclark, jhung or gmoss would have a better idea when they are online.
2020-03-18T12:29:44  <akhillll9096> Yeah. I have sent a DM to @gmoss .
2020-03-18T12:29:58  <Justin_o> akhillll9096: regarding the design of the existing sites, the fluidproject site will need to be updated and probably redesigned. Not sure about floe project. I'd suggest you start with the migration and leave room in your proposal to address site changes/redesign/etc.
2020-03-18T12:30:41  <Justin_o> akhillll9096: try to avoid private messages, if the mentors aren't available, it's better to e-mail the fluid-work list
2020-03-18T12:31:06  <akhillll9096> Oh, Alright. Sure, ill keep thatbin mind.
2020-03-18T12:31:08  <Justin_o> It keeps things public, and in IRC if you both people aren't online you can't send messages back and forth
2020-03-18T12:31:23  <akhillll9096> Yeah, sure :)

2020-03-18T13:30:28  <Justin_o> akhillll9096: you can add that to your proposal if you  like, some of these final decisions will need to be made with the involvement of others in the community though. So I'd suggest leaving room for exploration/investigation and discussion

2020-03-18T16:00:16  <Justin_o> alanharnum: I have a couple of questions, 1) how do you feel about talking about the vertical layout for clusive's UIO instance as part of a discussion on a native vertical layout for UIO and/or UIO+
2020-03-18T16:00:35  <Justin_o> alanharnum: also, any luck with determining URLs for JIRA and Confluence if we migrate
2020-03-18T16:01:55  <alanharnum> Justin_o: 1) I'm happy to talk about the vertical layout at some point (are there things you're specifically interested in?); 2) Haven't had a chance to look into it closely, but I believe (for Jira) that ticket IDs will stay the same betweensystems, so it would be possible to set up a redirect
2020-03-18T16:04:42  <Justin_o> alanharnum: not sure exactly, but I believe it's our only current example of a vertical layout so maybe you can talk a bit about why you made it that way, and design decisions.. things that are better or you like about it, things we should improve on.. stuff like that.. I'm thinking we can use it as a starting point to get to a design to implement for UIO and/or UIO+.
2020-03-18T16:04:56  <Justin_o> perhaps it will even end up looking quite similar to what you have
2020-03-18T16:05:35  <alanharnum> Justin_o: OK, if you're interested in the design considerations, I can see about bringing in the design folks from CAST - I just did the implementation to wire it to UIO
2020-03-18T16:06:02  <Justin_o> regarding JIRA, that's good news. It was something there's been worry about regarding changing issue trackers. Do you have some time later today for a quick chat, maybe between 1pm and 2:30pm.. I have a task to do some clean up of our various issue trackers so want to co-ordinate with you on that
2020-03-18T16:06:35  <Justin_o> alanharnum: sounds good.. would this coming Tuesday work? jhung is that time slot available for a Design Crit?

2020-03-18T16:07:23  <alanharnum> Justin_o: I'll have to check if people from CAST are available for the upcoming Tuesday
2020-03-18T16:07:48  <Justin_o> alanharnum: sure, tomorrow is fine I'm free pretty much anytime before 3:30. Let me know what works for you
2020-03-18T16:08:42  <Justin_o> alanharnum: regarding the Design Crit, if you and the CAST folks are available this Tuesday we can do then, otherwise we can try to pick a week that works for you all

2020-03-18T17:42:45  <sgithens> stegru cindyli Does using a local client credential require the windows service, or is there a startup option I can use when just running `npm start` or `npm run dev` ?
2020-03-18T17:42:58  <sgithens> I need to test with a custom one for the capture tool
2020-03-18T17:43:19  <sgithens> I guess I should look at the secret blower as well.  What actual repo is that in?
2020-03-18T17:46:02  <stegru> I think it does need the service to be running.. you can run `npm run service` from gpii-windows to get it running, you'll need to update %gpii-windows/gpii-service/test-secret.json5
2020-03-18T17:46:43  <stegru> look in the release directories on gdrive for the credentials installers
2020-03-18T17:47:25  <sgithens> stegru cool thanks. So the code to build the credentials installer is on drive? Is it another wix project?
2020-03-18T17:47:51  <stegru> well... that's something that should go into gpii-tools :)
2020-03-18T17:48:07  <sgithens> cool, but it is a wix project then?
2020-03-18T17:48:37  <stegru> yes... but all that does is copy `secret.txt` to c:\programdata\Morphic Credentials
2020-03-18T17:48:50  <sgithens> ah, cool
2020-03-18T17:49:12  <sgithens> do you have any outstanding changes to it to upload before I add it to gpii-tools?
2020-03-18T17:49:58  <Shyamal> Hello everyone! A quick question. Who is the current org admin? I have to add their name in the proposal.
2020-03-18T17:50:49  <stegru> sgithens, I tihnk javi will have the most up to date version
2020-03-18T17:51:24  <stegru> he builds them
2020-03-18T17:51:35  <sgithens> stegru: Hmm, ok, since it does very little, hopefully it hasn't really changed much
2020-03-18T17:51:57  <stegru> also, it looks like you can put the credentials in this file: %gpii-universal/testData/clientCredentials/pilot.json
2020-03-18T17:52:06  <stegru> instead of using the service
2020-03-18T17:52:32  <sgithens> perfect
2020-03-18T17:53:18  <stegru> not sure if it works, but this was my clue: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/8b55353d9c065a487cd7fd1d3e282de940e0d4ec/gpii/node_modules/gpii-service-handler/src/serviceHandler.js#L320

2020-03-18T22:24:09  <sachin10101998> Justin_o could you look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/172
2020-03-18T22:24:28  <sachin10101998> images were not rendering in that infusion doc chapter
2020-03-18T22:28:44  <sachin10101998> images do not get rendered if they are used in md format links inside a semantic html tag
2020-03-18T22:29:33  <sachin10101998> i included them inside <img> tag , (could have been solved by removing <figure> tag too)
