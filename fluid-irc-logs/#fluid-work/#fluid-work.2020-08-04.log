2020-08-04T15:37:25  <raunak> cindyli can you give me 5 minutes to dicuss the 1 part of this issue----------- https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/256#issuecomment-668667902
2020-08-04T15:42:35  <cindyli> sure, raunak. what's your question?
2020-08-04T15:43:09  <raunak> i already fixed this issue here the screenshot
2020-08-04T15:43:22  <raunak> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/En4TGqrL/%231%20after.PNG
2020-08-04T15:43:42  <raunak> but for this i need to excess the DIST folder what this DIST folder this ignore by the .GITIGNORE FILT ....
2020-08-04T15:44:05  <raunak> so can i remove this folder from .gitignore file ?????????
2020-08-04T15:45:24  <raunak> beacuse for this i need a only html file and that html file is only available in DIST FOLDER
2020-08-04T15:47:09  <cindyli> i don't think you should remove /dist from .gitignore. please read eleventy doc (https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) to understand why /dist is created and should not be committed into github
2020-08-04T15:47:26  <cindyli> raunak: ^
2020-08-04T15:51:45  <raunak> ok  but ,you can only  fixed this issue only from there html files  and this html file is only available in DIST folder
2020-08-04T15:54:47  <cindyli> raunak: all html files in the /dist folder are generated by Eleventy, a static site generator. The original files for generating these html files are in /src folder
2020-08-04T15:57:13  <raunak> ok i will find that file and fixed this bug and create the pr for this thanks...........
2020-08-04T16:05:57  <cindyli> thanks, raunak, please keep in mind that the fix is not about one or two appearances of this problem in a single html file, the solution should be applied across the system

2020-08-04T17:31:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: I noticed that testem doesn't run the ST browser tests in Edge 84 (Chromium), is it only meant to run headless browsers, or should I expect that it will detect and run all browsers that are installed?
2020-08-04T17:32:20  <Justin_o> gmoss: I don't believe there are any runners for Edge, and it may be considered the same as chrome now.
2020-08-04T17:32:59  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah that's consistent with the GitHub issue I just found: https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/996
2020-08-04T17:32:59  <gmoss> I think it makes sense, though I suppose it's possible the two will have differing results
2020-08-04T17:33:37  <gmoss> wait, gtirloni worked on this, I forgot: https://github.com/testem/testem/pull/1410
2020-08-04T17:35:43  <Justin_o> gmoss: can you run this "npx testem launchers"
2020-08-04T17:37:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: I wonder also if we'll ever be able to surface SJRK-372 now that browser tests are handled by testem...
2020-08-04T17:37:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: that command does not list Edge for me, though it does list IE! The whole list is: Firefox; Headless Firefox; Chrome; Headless Chrome; IE
2020-08-04T17:38:02  <gmoss> IE tests are not run (not an issue), but I wonder if I should expect them to
2020-08-04T17:38:20  <Justin_o> gmoss: only Headless Firefox and Headless Chrome are run
2020-08-04T17:38:31  <Justin_o> but we could look at trying adding Headless Edge
2020-08-04T17:39:10  <gtirloni> it works but testem hasn't released a new version with it yet.. unless we want to point to the commit that added Edge directly in package.json
2020-08-04T17:39:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay. yeah I think it makes sense to include Edge, even if the results are identical to Chrome, since the codebases may diverge in the future.
2020-08-04T17:39:28  <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, I was just looking at that.. they haven't released since April
2020-08-04T17:39:29  <gmoss> gtirloni: I don't think it's a priority, so maybe we can just wait for a version
2020-08-04T17:39:34  <gtirloni> ok
2020-08-04T17:39:38  <gmoss> just trying to figure out what happened haha
2020-08-04T17:40:22  <gmoss> thanks Justin_o and gtirloni for your work on this and for helping me understand just now :)
2020-08-04T17:40:25  <Justin_o> gmoss: would you be able to file a JIRA about adding Headless Edge after the next testem release.
2020-08-04T17:40:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: sure
2020-08-04T17:40:36  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-08-04T17:41:39  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm going to try to add a new component to the project, since this doesn't quite count as strictly UI or Server any more
2020-08-04T17:41:48  <gtirloni> they don't seem to keep github releases and npm release in sync, so maybe check the npm site directly
2020-08-04T17:42:14  <gmoss> looks like this was 2 months ago: https://www.npmjs.com/package/testem/v/3.2.0
2020-08-04T17:42:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: maybe a CI component?
2020-08-04T17:42:35  <gmoss> Justin_o: good idea!
2020-08-04T17:44:01  <Justin_o> gmoss: can you just try to add "Headless Edge" to this line https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/tests/ui/testem.js#L35
2020-08-04T17:44:20  <Justin_o> You may not be able to add a space between the "," and the next browser name in the string
2020-08-04T17:44:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: sure, I'll give it a shot
2020-08-04T17:44:43  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-08-04T17:44:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: I don't think I can add components to the Jira project, I guess I don't have rights. I'll file the new Jira under UI for the time being
2020-08-04T17:45:31  <jhung> philip and Justin_o - I've updated the Community workshop page to also include design crits. Please take a look at it and make any edits. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops+and+design+crits
2020-08-04T17:46:10  <philip> jhung: Thanks! Will do
2020-08-04T17:47:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: adding "Headless Edge" to the list had no effect
2020-08-04T17:47:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: sorry, we'll have to wait for the update then :(
2020-08-04T17:48:06  <Justin_o> or rather, an upate
2020-08-04T17:49:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: yep, no problem :)
2020-08-04T17:50:15  <Justin_o> gmoss: we also don't support Safari because there is an issue with the launcher for Safari 13
2020-08-04T17:50:38  <gmoss> Justin_o: noted. I wouldn't have seen that on my machine either way, but it's good to know
2020-08-04T17:52:35  <gmoss> Justin_o: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-383
2020-08-04T17:52:44  <gmoss> short and sweet :) I can add more detail if you like
2020-08-04T17:52:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks for filing that
2020-08-04T17:53:52  <gmoss> :)
2020-08-04T17:54:00  <gmoss> I'll add it to the spreadsheet now as well
2020-08-04T18:02:04  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks...
2020-08-04T18:02:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: I think I forgot to register for the webinar, do you have the link handy?
2020-08-04T18:03:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: rather, is there a link to join without first registering?
2020-08-04T18:03:28  <Justin_o> gmoss: taking a look.. I think I had a unique url
