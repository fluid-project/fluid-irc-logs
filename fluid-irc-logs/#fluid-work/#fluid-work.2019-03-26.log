2019-03-26T10:28:48  <javjarfer[m]> Hi good morning Bosmon
2019-03-26T10:29:27  <javjarfer[m]> Do you have time for a issue that I'm having since yesterday? It may be related with https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3784
2019-03-26T10:35:50  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - sorry, rather busy with the CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE this morning : P
2019-03-26T10:36:14  <Bosmon> What do you think of cindyli's fix?
2019-03-26T10:36:35  <Bosmon> I have to say I still didn't fully understand why the tail path segment should be a top level filter in its own right
2019-03-26T10:36:44  <Bosmon> Which is one of the various reasons I left the fix on the table for now
2019-03-26T10:49:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: of course, that sounds more urgent xd. I can try the fix in my branch to see if that solves this issue
2019-03-26T10:49:33  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I can take a look to that too, I haven't looked the fix into that detail

2019-03-26T11:21:29  <Bosmon> Hi there stegru, sgithens, I'll have to punt on the meeting in 10 mins since I am busy debugging the auto-key-in problem
2019-03-26T11:21:50  <stegru> fine with me, Bosmon
2019-03-26T11:22:33  <Bosmon> My findings so far - strongly suspect that the problem is actually nothing to do with autokeyin at all, but some kind of standing race condition that has always been there in the gpii-app code
2019-03-26T11:22:51  <Bosmon> So there is not really any way we can push the autologin to be "late enough" by just delaying longer
2019-03-26T11:22:53  <stegru> ok
2019-03-26T11:23:23  <Bosmon> So far what I observe is that everything on the main process model is correct, but somehow the model on the renderer side has got out of step and believes noone is logged on
2019-03-26T11:23:43  <Bosmon> So this seems like some kind of cross-process race mediated presumably by some kind of IPC blunder
2019-03-26T11:23:56  <Bosmon> Right now I can't think this could happen except through IPC messages being delivered out of order, which is presumably impossible
2019-03-26T11:29:17  <sgithens> Be there in like 5 mins

2019-03-26T11:35:06  <sgithens> Actually, I don't see where we are meeting on the calendar entry
2019-03-26T11:35:13  <cindyli> Bosmon, sgithens, stegru, ready to meet? skype?
2019-03-26T11:35:25  <sgithens> for sure
2019-03-26T11:35:27  <Bosmon> cindyli - I'll have to bail today
2019-03-26T11:35:31  <cindyli> javi is not online
2019-03-26T11:35:33  <Bosmon> I'm busy debugging the autokeyin issue
2019-03-26T11:35:45  <sgithens> should we move to tomorrow or thursday?
2019-03-26T11:35:46  <cindyli> ok. shall we move it to tomorrow morning?
2019-03-26T11:35:57  <Bosmon> Could do
2019-03-26T11:36:00  <Bosmon> I might still be busy tomorrow : P
2019-03-26T11:36:13  <cindyli> thursday?
2019-03-26T11:36:20  <Bosmon> Well who knows : P
2019-03-26T11:36:26  <sgithens> ...
2019-03-26T11:36:36  <sgithens> let's tentatively try for thursday?
2019-03-26T11:37:00  <sgithens> once the race condition is worked out, this is to actually talk about the NOVA keying in and out right?
2019-03-26T11:37:20  <sgithens> so I'm assuming it sort of next-ish in priority once thats worked out?
2019-03-26T11:37:50  <cindyli> let's try thursday then.
2019-03-26T11:37:57  <sgithens> that sounds great
2019-03-26T11:38:16  <sgithens> cindyli, thanks for all your review so far.  I'll use this time to go work on your comments :)
2019-03-26T11:39:52  <cindyli> thank, sgithens. i haven't finished reviewing this huge pull request. you did lots of work!!!

2019-03-26T12:05:35  <jhernandez> I see that you're with "THE THING"
2019-03-26T12:05:37  <Bosmon> jhernandez - ENSIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ!
2019-03-26T12:05:44  <Bosmon> Yes
2019-03-26T12:05:48  <Bosmon> We are in room ..... TWO
2019-03-26T12:05:51  <jhernandez> ohh
2019-03-26T12:05:57  <jhernandez> heading there
2019-03-26T12:07:35  <jhernandez> sorry, this morning had to do some workpaper in the commune
2019-03-26T12:08:55  <jhernandez> and just got home
2019-03-26T12:18:23  <jhernandez> Bosmon: shall we mention that last resort shorcut?
2019-03-26T12:18:41  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I wasn't aware of a last resort shortcut
2019-03-26T12:18:42  <jhernandez> a setTimeout in the right spot
2019-03-26T12:18:48  <Bosmon> jhernandez - it doesn't work
2019-03-26T12:18:58  <jhernandez> it does for me
2019-03-26T12:19:02  <Danail_Dido> It will work, if its long enough :-)
2019-03-26T12:19:11  <Bosmon> I see
2019-03-26T12:19:16  <Bosmon> Where do you put it, and how long does it need to be
2019-03-26T12:19:31  <jhernandez> 3.5 seconds was my best guess
2019-03-26T12:19:33  <Danail_Dido> I managed to brake it for me too, just put a bushit .bat file that copies some files on boot.
2019-03-26T12:19:50  <jhernandez> which isn't terrible if you're logging into windows
2019-03-26T12:19:53  <Danail_Dido> 3~5 seconds if the Windows its not too broken, way longer if it is.
2019-03-26T12:20:09  <Danail_Dido> My vote is for 5s.
2019-03-26T12:20:45  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/155/files#diff-740552bcf8bd9d31886138b241b1ffb6R53
2019-03-26T12:20:51  <Bosmon> Fine ....
2019-03-26T12:21:12  <jhernandez> if you wrap that with a setTImeout, it works all the time here
2019-03-26T12:22:00  <jhernandez> not sure if there's a better place for it
2019-03-26T12:22:03  <jhernandez> stegru: ?
2019-03-26T12:23:27  <stegru> yes?
2019-03-26T12:23:49  <jhernandez> if we decide to use the setTimeout bullet
2019-03-26T12:24:13  <jhernandez> where would you say is the best place for it?
2019-03-26T12:24:19  <stegru> that place
2019-03-26T12:24:23  <jhernandez> I added it in the link above
2019-03-26T12:24:24  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-26T12:24:26  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-03-26T12:24:57  <stegru> ok i have a pie to eat
2019-03-26T12:25:20  <jhernandez> Bosmon: and btw, yesterday I added a onQssReady event, I got it propagated up in the app and added as one of the onPSPPrerequisitesReady
2019-03-26T12:25:50  <Bosmon> jhernandez - thanks
2019-03-26T12:25:58  <Bosmon> Unfortunately it all appears to be a sea of red herrings
2019-03-26T12:26:11  <jhernandez> but that event is being fired way too late and make things not to start up correctly
2019-03-26T12:26:14  <Bosmon> As you said yesterday, this is a race condition that has probably been with us right since the beginning
2019-03-26T12:26:19  <jhernandez> yup
2019-03-26T12:26:28  <jhernandez> :(
2019-03-26T12:27:48  <Danail_Dido> @stegru, what kind of pie? Shoot me a picture!
2019-03-26T12:28:03  <Danail_Dido> I still haven't eat today (and its almost 3pm) :-(

2019-03-26T12:32:26  <javjarfer[m]> oh comen on, stegru , haven't eat yet too
2019-03-26T12:32:55  <stegru> you all need to get a good wife, who brings them home for you :D

2019-03-26T12:33:11  <Danail_Dido> Hehehe, @stegru you just killed us!
2019-03-26T12:34:08  <Danail_Dido> @Bosmon, can we use the keyout for now?
2019-03-26T12:34:48  <jhernandez> "stegru: you all need to get a good wife, who brings them home for you :D"
2019-03-26T12:35:18  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - use the kyout for what?
2019-03-26T12:35:20  <jhernandez> there's also uber food
2019-03-26T12:35:42  <stegru> true, and it's probably cheaper - but I don't think we have that around here
2019-03-26T12:35:47  <Danail_Dido> Yeah, @stegru is making fun of all of us what don't have a good wife (or wife at all) ;-)
2019-03-26T12:37:32  <Danail_Dido> @Bosmon, I'm not sure if its OK for the app itself to look into a files in the Windows's system folders.
2019-03-26T12:37:55  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - well sure
2019-03-26T12:38:03  <Bosmon> But I don't feel we have any more time to fix the issue better
2019-03-26T12:38:52  <Danail_Dido> Sure, sure :-). And my question was if we can just use the keyout call in the reset instead.
2019-03-26T12:38:59  <Bosmon> But it is not in the system folder, it's in the user's area
2019-03-26T12:39:22  <Danail_Dido> They are using the same call, just different data, "reset" for the one "keyout" for the other.
2019-03-26T12:39:41  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - not sure what the question is there
2019-03-26T12:40:25  <Danail_Dido> Do you think if will work (and its appropriate) to send the "keyout" call on the reset button?
2019-03-26T12:40:45  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - not really, since we want the user to stay keyed in
2019-03-26T12:41:09  <Danail_Dido> Ohhh, yeah, yeah!
2019-03-26T12:41:36  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: I didn't wanted but I'm finally using justeat because of you (like uber foods here)
2019-03-26T12:42:04  <stegru> haha why me?
2019-03-26T12:42:18  <javjarfer[m]> because I want pie now
2019-03-26T12:44:44  <stegru> damn, uber can't feed me: https://i.imgur.com/ZWHThTQ.png
2019-03-26T12:45:07  <Danail_Dido> I want pie as well, but there is no way to even order one... there is no place that sells pies in my city (or even county) :-(
2019-03-26T12:45:30  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: so close...
2019-03-26T12:45:36  <jhernandez> stegru: https://i.imgur.com/b0DFaUQ.jpg
2019-03-26T12:45:38  <stegru> so what do you eat, Danail_Dido?
2019-03-26T12:45:49  <javjarfer[m]> I'm not being able to find pies in justeat btw, so thanks again stegru
2019-03-26T12:47:47  <Danail_Dido> @stegru, I guess I will go grab a hotdog or something (there is a hotdog place just below my building).
2019-03-26T12:48:20  <Danail_Dido> And for the pies they are not popular in my country, so I need to force my mom (or my sister) to bake me one ;-)
2019-03-26T12:48:29  <stegru> use my account, javjarfer[m]: https://i.imgur.com/BA8bmF8.png
2019-03-26T12:48:35  <Danail_Dido> Well, or maybe @stegru 's amazing wife can bake me one too :-P
2019-03-26T12:48:50  <stegru> heh
2019-03-26T12:48:57  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: really?
2019-03-26T12:49:40  <javjarfer[m]> okay, found it, no just eat tho, need to call... going back to 1995
2019-03-26T12:50:15  <stegru> ugh, i want to eat - not talk
2019-03-26T12:50:54  <Danail_Dido> Well @stegru, that's good for you, we are forced to talk because we all are in the call except for you :-P

2019-03-26T13:08:26  <jhernandez> Bosmon: btw - I'm seeing that after applying the setTimeout, now I can see the "wait" spinning morphic when auto-keying-in, which is a "good sign"
2019-03-26T13:08:55  <jhernandez> without the timeout I never get the wait dialog
2019-03-26T13:09:22  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well that's something : P
2019-03-26T13:09:42  <Bosmon> cindyli - I wonder if you could move this to the top of your queue? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3828
2019-03-26T13:09:48  <Bosmon> It arose in our meeting just now with Gregg
2019-03-26T13:09:57  <jhernandez> that confirms that, yes, it's too early for gpii-app to notice about core messages
2019-03-26T13:10:18  <cindyli> ok
2019-03-26T13:10:36  <Bosmon> kris_HA and Danail_Dido will implement a hack for now which reads the reset to standard file directly
2019-03-26T13:10:40  <jhernandez> and I guess that this also affects the reset to STD functionality too
2019-03-26T13:11:29  <jhernandez> the system resets to std, but the renderer process isn't noticing such model update
2019-03-26T13:12:42  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@198.178.118.18> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-26T13:13:06  <Bosmon> jhernandez - so my thinking is that the main QSS renderer process just takes much longer to actually be ready than we know
2019-03-26T13:13:22  <Bosmon> And this is also suggested by that weird state we sometimes see it in when its button images haven't loaded
2019-03-26T13:13:47  <jhernandez> nice guess, yes
2019-03-26T13:14:05  <jhernandez> I've seen that thing too, yes
2019-03-26T13:15:11  <jhernandez> so, FYI, my test last night was to wait for gpii.app.qss's onDialogReady event
2019-03-26T13:15:54  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/dialogs/basic/dialog.js#L76
2019-03-26T13:16:03  <Bosmon> Yes, I think even this will be too early
2019-03-26T13:16:12  <jhernandez> in fact it's too late
2019-03-26T13:16:17  <Bosmon> ?!
2019-03-26T13:16:20  <jhernandez> xDDD
2019-03-26T13:16:21  <Bosmon> What do you mean, too late
2019-03-26T13:17:00  <jhernandez> I propagated such event all the way up through the app's main component
2019-03-26T13:17:54  <jhernandez> and added to the bottom  here, https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L353
2019-03-26T13:18:05  <Bosmon> Yes
2019-03-26T13:18:07  <jhernandez> and I end up with the tray not showing
2019-03-26T13:18:24  <jhernandez> *ended up
2019-03-26T13:18:32  <Bosmon> Well, how did you propagate it
2019-03-26T13:19:01  <Bosmon> Anyway yes, you can't delaly THIS event on that
2019-03-26T13:19:10  <jhernandez> I created an onQssReeady event that was being fired when onDialogReady is fired
2019-03-26T13:19:20  <Bosmon> because this is the event that times the creation of all the dialogs
2019-03-26T13:19:26  <jhernandez> exactly
2019-03-26T13:19:27  <Bosmon> You could delay my new "indicative" event on this
2019-03-26T13:19:32  <Bosmon> But as I say, I think even this will be too early
2019-03-26T13:20:29  <jhernandez> hmm, I didn't tested as part of your indicative event
2019-03-26T13:20:47  <jhernandez> *didn't test it
2019-03-26T13:20:59  <Bosmon> Oh no, you're right
2019-03-26T13:21:05  <Bosmon> They have already implemented what we want
2019-03-26T13:21:06  <Bosmon> This is a help
2019-03-26T13:21:25  <Bosmon> I was going to say, "the only surefire way to wait to be ready is to lob an IPC event back from the renderer process when it is done"
2019-03-26T13:21:30  <Bosmon> But this is exactly what they have done
2019-03-26T13:22:06  <Bosmon> What's hilarious is that this event is currently only used to make test cases run reliably :)
2019-03-26T13:22:16  <jhernandez> ha!
2019-03-26T13:22:35  <simonjb> maybe somthing is needed that is both "indicative" and "meaningful"?
2019-03-26T13:22:37  <Bosmon> OK, so this suggests a good line of improvement for the "indicative fix"
2019-03-26T13:23:05  <Bosmon> simonjb - if only they had such profound thinking available in the Commons today :)

2019-03-26T13:48:23  <Bosmon> jhernandez - this is looking more plausible now
2019-03-26T13:48:44  <Bosmon> The time between overall startup and attempting to key in the user to the QSS is a full 20 seconds
2019-03-26T14:05:29  <jhernandez> wow, 20 secs
2019-03-26T14:05:49  <jhernandez> Bosmon: btw, this is how I propagated the event https://pastebin.com/RzQAbsf0
2019-03-26T14:06:31  <Bosmon> jhernandez - cheers, yes
2019-03-26T14:06:34  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-26T14:06:36  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-03-26T14:06:38  <Bosmon> So my improved fix has half-worked
2019-03-26T14:06:50  <Bosmon> Now I am in the state where the Save button is correct but the state of the button isn't
2019-03-26T14:06:57  <jhernandez> haha
2019-03-26T14:06:59  <jhernandez> almost there!
2019-03-26T14:07:01  <Bosmon> So we need to do the same thing all over again for settings messages
2019-03-26T14:07:22  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3828, if resetAtStart flag is false meaning the reset to standard is not performed at the system start, do you think PSP channel should still send back default values from the reset to standard file?
2019-03-26T14:07:39  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, it should
2019-03-26T14:07:58  <Bosmon> They are still the defaults that will be enacted at any time where there actually *is* a reset to standard
2019-03-26T14:08:12  <cindyli> ok, all empty payloads should be replaced by these default values, right?
2019-03-26T14:08:38  <cindyli> which usually happens when noUser keys back in
2019-03-26T14:08:43  <Bosmon> cindyli - oh, I see...
2019-03-26T14:09:01  <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, so remind me on what basis we send an empty payload after reset to standard?
2019-03-26T14:09:12  <Bosmon> That is ..... why? : P
2019-03-26T14:09:35  <cindyli> when reset completes and noUser keys back in, empty payload is sent back
2019-03-26T14:18:39  <cindyli> i feel the default settings should only be sent back when these settings do get applied. it includes these cases:
2019-03-26T14:19:31  <cindyli> 1. if resetAtStart === true, default settings are applied at the system start, when noUsers keys in, defaults are sent to gpii-app
2019-03-26T14:20:15  <cindyli> 2. when a reset request completes and defaults are applied, noUsers keys in and defaults are sent to gpii-app
2019-03-26T14:21:04  <cindyli> in other cases, for example, resetAtStart === false, default settings are NOT applied at the system start, the defaults probably should not be sent out
2019-03-26T14:22:03  <cindyli> Bosmon: would love to hear your thoughts
2019-03-26T14:22:44  <Bosmon> cindyli yes, this sounds correct
2019-03-26T14:22:59  <Bosmon> But WHY do we send an empty payload when the reset completes and noUser keys back in?
2019-03-26T14:23:58  <cindyli> i believe it's 'cuz the session for noUser is initialized
2019-03-26T14:24:26  <cindyli> which triggers the model relay from lifecycle manager session component to psp channel component
2019-03-26T14:25:27  <jhernandez> and because we decided that gpii-app should use gpii-app's defaults rather that whatever was applied at core level after receiving an empty payload? just speculating ... leaving with dogz for a walk :)
2019-03-26T14:25:33  <cindyli> i will have to figure out how to send back the defaults without messing up session.model for noUser
2019-03-26T14:25:54  <Bosmon> cindyli - you can just write all the material in sessionToPSP
2019-03-26T14:26:08  <Bosmon> It's effectively a relay rule which relays out of nothing into something
2019-03-26T14:26:57  <cindyli> the problem is at the system start, if defaults are not applied, we should still send back the empty payload, right
2019-03-26T14:27:00  <cindyli> ?
2019-03-26T14:27:56  <cindyli> in sessionToPSP, i have no way to determine if defaults are applied or not without info from lifecycle manager

2019-03-26T15:03:14  <cindyli> congrats!!
2019-03-26T15:05:03  <cindyli> Bosmon: reset to defaults is performed by restoreSession that doesn't have a model relay with psp channel. you must have some ideas of how to get info from lifecycleManager when defaults are applied

2019-03-26T16:11:27  <Bosmon> Cool
2019-03-26T16:11:30  <Bosmon> In terms of "a lot"
2019-03-26T16:11:33  <Bosmon> Have you seen it fail yet?
2019-03-26T16:12:22  <jhernandez> not yet
2019-03-26T16:12:44  <jhernandez> but I'll keep trying a bit more before calling it "a fix"!!
2019-03-26T16:16:23  <jhernandez> interesting that I'm not seeing the morphic spinner when auto-keying-in now - which I think it's okay as long as the qss has the right values

2019-03-26T16:16:38  <jhernandez> okay
2019-03-26T16:16:56  <Bosmon> But why does Gregg talk about it being "blue" when it is green?
2019-03-26T16:17:01  <jhernandez> there might be things in the renderer side that aren't yet there
2019-03-26T16:17:17  <jhernandez> but I guess it's fine
2019-03-26T16:17:28  <jhernandez> it is green, maybe he's color blind ?

2019-03-26T17:16:02  <Bosmon> They are not in step?
2019-03-26T17:16:45  <jhernandez> nope, seems that the save button is on his "thread" - the green indicators are there, but save remains green

2019-03-26T19:03:10  <cindyli> you know what it means
2019-03-26T19:05:06  <cindyli> or is there a way to pass "source" value of the model change to "singleTransform" function?
2019-03-26T19:08:29  <cindyli> nvm. seems "includeSource" does do the trick. thanks
2019-03-26T19:09:51  <cindyli> I think the mistake i made was having both "includeSource" and "excludeSource" inside "forward" object. only "excludeSource" takes effect as it was listed as the first one

2019-03-26T21:19:56  <colinclark> gmoss do we have a brief description of what kinds of things happen at the community?
2019-03-26T21:20:23  <gmoss> colinclark: there's a blurb at the top of the wiki page, here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops
2019-03-26T21:20:52  <colinclark> Cool. Maybe I’ll send him the recording of the one I gave as an example
2019-03-26T21:20:53  <gmoss> the format is flexible, as you know, and topics vary pretty widely, but I would suggest Chris could check out that page and see some previous topics

2019-03-26T22:13:22  <stegru> jhernandez, as you know, the vs runtime install is a turd.. however, there is already a merge module available for it in C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Merge Modules
2019-03-26T22:14:33  <stegru> but merge modules can't be bundled inside another merge module - however, I'm about to find out if we really need to install it, since we already install another version of the runtime in the main wix file
2019-03-26T22:20:49  <jhernandez> thanks for reporting
2019-03-26T22:20:55  <jhernandez> stegru: Bosmon
2019-03-26T22:20:57  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-03-26T22:21:08  <stegru> handy tip for everyone: to double your download speed, don't click the download button twice
2019-03-26T22:21:20  <jhernandez> but with that installer we're not installing t
2019-03-26T22:21:56  <stegru> what installer?

2019-03-26T22:22:28  <jhernandez> that's .... weird
2019-03-26T22:22:37  <jhernandez> very
2019-03-26T22:22:58  <stegru> perhaps when you ran it, you already had the runtime installed? I did it on a clean vm
2019-03-26T22:23:10  <jhernandez> because I was said that, if you don't have that dep installed, the installer just complains about it and never gets installed
2019-03-26T22:23:40  <stegru> oh
2019-03-26T22:23:44  <jhernandez> Han reported that
2019-03-26T22:23:55  <stegru> ah yes, I remember - sorry, i didn't give it much attention
2019-03-26T22:24:27  <jhernandez> and to fix that, I'm already including that dep as part of our merge module, but I haven't delivered any installer that bundles the dep yet
2019-03-26T22:24:52  <stegru> so where is my error coming from?
2019-03-26T22:25:18  <jhernandez> not a clue
2019-03-26T22:25:28  <jhernandez> honestly
2019-03-26T22:25:47  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-03-26T22:26:00  <jhernandez> and that happens with the our vm?
2019-03-26T22:26:11  <stegru> I don't know
2019-03-26T22:26:37  <stegru> i'll let you know in a few minutes
2019-03-26T22:26:40  <jhernandez> the clean vm is our vagrant box?
2019-03-26T22:26:45  <jhernandez> ah
2019-03-26T22:26:45  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-26T22:26:48  <stegru> no
2019-03-26T22:27:13  <stegru> it has nothing installed, except virtual box guest additions
2019-03-26T22:27:28  <stegru> but i'm making one now with nothing at all on it
2019-03-26T22:28:11  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-26T22:28:21  <jhernandez> FYI, this is the sharex-module code
2019-03-26T22:28:22  <jhernandez> https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-sharex-installer
2019-03-26T22:28:24  <stegru> Morphic-1.0.1-dev.20190321T003453Z.9b4cbba.GPII-3806.loginSolution
2019-03-26T22:28:29  <stegru> yes, got it
2019-03-26T22:29:14  <jhernandez> right, that Morphic installer version is not yet shipping the bits I added to automatically install the damned visual c++ redistributable
2019-03-26T22:32:50  <stegru> ok well, what I'm going to do is 1) determine if we actually need this redist, and 2) see if including the ready-made merge module for it is enough
2019-03-26T22:33:58  <jhernandez> nice, thanks
2019-03-26T22:34:39  <jhernandez> AFAIK, the module is required by ShareX
2019-03-26T22:35:21  <jhernandez> and it complains about not having that visual c++ lib and rejects to install (that's what Han reported)
2019-03-26T22:35:51  <jhernandez> re 2) I searched the msm module of that redist and couldn't find one
2019-03-26T22:36:13  <jhernandez> that's why I added in the merge module the bits to bundle and install such thing

2019-03-26T22:36:35  <stegru> ok - that does surprise me, considering shareX is .NET, but perhap's it has another dependency, I thought it was for ffmpeg or node
2019-03-26T22:36:59  <jhernandez> my merge module downloads it here: https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-sharex-installer/blob/master/getDependencies.ps1#L34
2019-03-26T22:37:22  <jhernandez> and it installs it here: https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-sharex-installer/blob/master/sharex.wxs#L39
2019-03-26T22:37:51  <stegru> yep, but it looks like that installer can't be installed from our installer - because only 1 msi installer can be ran at a time
2019-03-26T22:37:58  <jhernandez> and I had to add this horrible condition https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-sharex-installer/blob/master/sharex.wxs#L11-L15
2019-03-26T22:38:09  <jhernandez> it's not an msi, it's an exe file
2019-03-26T22:38:50  <stegru> ok
2019-03-26T22:39:55  <jhernandez> stegru: I have an installer here that has the bits to install the vcredist
2019-03-26T22:40:07  <jhernandez> do you want it and give it a try too?

2019-03-26T23:06:15  <jhernandez> i'm completely puzzled
2019-03-26T23:07:33  <jhernandez> can you install it manually and get the log?

2019-03-26T23:10:57  <jhernandez> but .... I don't have a clue why it's autoinstalling
2019-03-26T23:12:09  <stegru> well, I've installed the runtime separately (from the deps directory) and it worked - installing gpii now..
2019-03-26T23:15:44  <stegru> meanwhile, I've just installed windows and I can run sharex without installing any runtime
2019-03-26T23:18:34  <jhernandez> well, it's not sharex
2019-03-26T23:18:55  <jhernandez> it's a sharex thing what complains about it
2019-03-26T23:19:06  <jhernandez> the Recorder Devices Setup.exe
2019-03-26T23:20:12  <jhernandez> https://github.com/javihernandez/morphic-sharex-installer/blob/master/sharex.wxs#L29
2019-03-26T23:21:01  <stegru> well, I ran it and it didn't complain for me.. it told me it was about to download the redistributable, then just did it
2019-03-26T23:21:41  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-03-26T23:26:19  <stegru> oh it's the recorder setup that's running the redist installer, not you jhernandez
2019-03-26T23:26:28  <jhernandez> exactly
2019-03-26T23:26:47  <stegru> well, that's shit
2019-03-26T23:26:55  <jhernandez> but I thought it was failing all the time as Han reported
2019-03-26T23:26:56  <jhernandez> :/
2019-03-26T23:27:02  <stegru> where is this report?
2019-03-26T23:27:03  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-03-26T23:27:25  <stegru> we could change the Return to asyncNoWait, or whatever it is
2019-03-26T23:27:32  <jhernandez> the first one was here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDutrsQlks4VZpVEuZCMUgJMsYyujfDr27cwO0Pn7mE/edit#
2019-03-26T23:27:38  <jhernandez> reported as H1
2019-03-26T23:28:40  <jhernandez> stegru: but we do need to wait until this is done because is a pre-requisite to auto-configure the microphone in sharex
2019-03-26T23:29:03  <stegru> ok
2019-03-26T23:29:25  <jhernandez> and then, Bern reported it too, but I didn't notice that he's getting the same as you
2019-03-26T23:29:32  <jhernandez> (not the error as Han)
2019-03-26T23:30:02  <jhernandez> here's Bern's report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAt8T5nQMSORcesv0lFXutWVCjuF3pP8gLm7DAgELWM/edit#heading=h.ynlgr9wasrd
2019-03-26T23:30:04  <jhernandez> B1
2019-03-26T23:30:05  <stegru> well, i'll see if adding the runtime merge module to the main installer works
2019-03-26T23:30:32  <jhernandez> did you find the msm?
2019-03-26T23:30:53  <stegru> yeh it's in c:\program files (x86)\common\merge modules
2019-03-26T23:30:58  <jhernandez> I couldn't find it
2019-03-26T23:31:11  <jhernandez> let me search again
2019-03-26T23:31:45  <jhernandez> nope, only VC140, not VC100
2019-03-26T23:32:25  <jhernandez> and I've got the 2010 redist installed
2019-03-26T23:32:26  <stegru> oh that's right
2019-03-26T23:32:35  <jhernandez> at least, it's listed as installed on Windows
2019-03-26T23:35:24  <jhernandez> so, as long as I can tell, my installation of the redist should avoid the other thing to try downloading it - which we know that fails :/
2019-03-26T23:39:41  <jhernandez> here we go
2019-03-26T23:39:50  <jhernandez> https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.Setup/InnoSetup/Recorder-devices-setup.iss#L38
2019-03-26T23:40:39  <stegru> haha why didn't I think of that? I was about to decompile the installer
2019-03-26T23:40:57  <jhernandez> which points to https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.Setup/InnoSetup/Scripts/products/vcredist2010.iss#L21
2019-03-26T23:41:10  <jhernandez> and tries to install it - exactly the same way I do
2019-03-26T23:41:11  <jhernandez> :P
2019-03-26T23:41:22  <jhernandez> ok
2019-03-26T23:42:20  <jhernandez> stegru: I also just find it, I wasn't expecting to see the source files at all :)
2019-03-26T23:43:09  <stegru> so what was wrong with how you installed the runtime?
2019-03-26T23:47:57  <jhernandez> it's nothing wrong, got installed in my case
2019-03-26T23:49:04  <jhernandez> but looks like the recorder devices installer is not detecting it as installed and tries to install it automatically
2019-03-26T23:49:17  <stegru> ok
2019-03-26T23:51:48  <stegru> fuck it, i'm going bed.. tomorrow I'll get the merge modules from somewhere and use them.. then put the dlls from the recorder setup into the sharex module
2019-03-26T23:52:07  <jhernandez> well, I think we can try building our own version of the recorder devices installer (and removing the vcredist-related thing)
2019-03-26T23:52:13  <stegru> yeh
2019-03-26T23:52:22  <jhernandez> yesh, go to bed
2019-03-26T23:52:28  <jhernandez> I couldn't find an msm file
2019-03-26T23:52:28  <stegru> good night :*
2019-03-26T23:52:35  <jhernandez> but good luck with that
2019-03-26T23:52:40  <jhernandez> :P
