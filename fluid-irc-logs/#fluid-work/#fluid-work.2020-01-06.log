2020-01-06T13:20:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @Bosmon and @gmoss
2020-01-06T13:21:01  *** jhung <jhung!~jhung@CPE0c473dc371c3-CM0c473dc371c0.cpe.net.fido.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2020-01-06T13:21:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm looking into a quick fix for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4259
2020-01-06T13:21:29  <the-t-in-rtf> Just wanted to confirm whether I need to use a recent mainstream infusion or (I assume) the potentia-ii branch
2020-01-06T13:23:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume 3.0.0-dev.20191107T164711Z.332e92c33.FLUID-6148 is enough to see the problem?
2020-01-06T13:24:31  <the-t-in-rtf> seems like it, things blew up suitably when I updated to that
2020-01-06T13:26:19  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, or maybe it's unrelated
2020-01-06T13:27:37  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the FLUID-6145 branches are now current
2020-01-06T13:27:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Gregor's work uses the one I pasted
2020-01-06T13:27:58  <the-t-in-rtf> but fair enough
2020-01-06T13:28:11  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully the colour of the flames will change if I move to the latest
2020-01-06T13:28:32  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - they are still in sync, but FLUID-6145 now contains additional fixes in addition to the baseline immutability features
2020-01-06T13:41:45  <the-t-in-rtf> nearly every test fails with either, I'll have to pick through a couple of examples
2020-01-06T13:47:04  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has joined #fluid-work
2020-01-06T13:49:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm getting lots of variations on "FluidIoC.js:2374 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'pendingPotentiae' of undefined"
2020-01-06T13:50:27  <the-t-in-rtf> with a little bit of this sprinkled in "FluidIoC.js:2292 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'makeSequencer' of undefined"
2020-01-06T13:51:19  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe 10% of the flames are that colour, the rest are pendingPotentiae purple

2020-01-06T13:51:39  <the-t-in-rtf> makeSequencer magenta?
2020-01-06T13:52:45  <gmoss> I appreciate that you're looking into it, the-t-in-rtf. I'm off today so I won't be able to do any testing today of fixes that you release
2020-01-06T13:52:48  <the-t-in-rtf> yay, no new lint errors, I can just commit and show you.
2020-01-06T13:52:57  <the-t-in-rtf> Canadian new year's?
2020-01-06T13:53:03  <gmoss> Sick day :(
2020-01-06T13:53:07  <the-t-in-rtf> or Canadian Lincoln's birthday?
2020-01-06T13:53:12  <the-t-in-rtf> aww, sorry
2020-01-06T13:53:34  <the-t-in-rtf> it's fine, I'd have to fix this in any case, and with luck I'll have it before you're back
2020-01-06T13:53:50  <the-t-in-rtf> I hope you feel better soon.
2020-01-06T13:56:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @Bosmon, https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-binder/tree/GPII-4259
2020-01-06T13:56:35  <the-t-in-rtf> "npm test"
2020-01-06T13:57:03  <the-t-in-rtf> that's enough to demonstrate the issues.
2020-01-06T13:57:49  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you should have cleared out your includes issues by now
2020-01-06T13:58:00  <Bosmon> FluidPromises.js has been a required dependency of the new framework for about a year
2020-01-06T13:58:17  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, you mean I need to use the rollup rather than cherry picking
2020-01-06T13:58:21  <the-t-in-rtf> fair enough
2020-01-06T13:58:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I used to think it was worth it to demonstrate which parts of Infusion were actually required
2020-01-06T13:59:05  <Bosmon> Well, it's still helpful
2020-01-06T13:59:08  <Bosmon> As long as it is up to date : P

2020-01-06T14:04:10  <the-t-in-rtf> That fixed nearly everything, I think the last goof was just leaving a manual Testem window open while the CI run was going.
2020-01-06T14:05:01  <the-t-in-rtf> yup, it's fine, committing now and putting in a pull.
2020-01-06T14:08:34  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-binder/pull/15
2020-01-06T14:08:46  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - great, super-quick fix
2020-01-06T14:09:24  <the-t-in-rtf> that's kind, I guess you're not counting the limp through late December and holidays
2020-01-06T14:09:39  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'm glad to start off with something
2020-01-06T14:09:46  <Bosmon> Yes, I am fairer than the officials in the TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT
2020-01-06T14:10:08  <Bosmon> Who refused to allow the trial to be restarted because the police had stopped the train
2020-01-06T14:10:27  <Bosmon> This is BINGGEHEAMMES all-time favorite film which he must have watched over 30 times by now
2020-01-06T14:10:41  <Bosmon> And it was also his grandfather's favorite film in his time
2020-01-06T14:11:04  <the-t-in-rtf> that's nice
2020-01-06T14:11:50  <the-t-in-rtf> LP is into the full 33 minute version of Stravinsky's "rite of spring"

2020-01-06T14:11:52  <Bosmon> "Official time of departure: Twelve oh three", he states in his official sing-song tones
2020-01-06T14:12:04  <the-t-in-rtf> He has somehow managed to watch that at least a dozen times.
2020-01-06T14:12:09  <Bosmon> We know it is the official time of departure because it has been stated by an OFFICIAL
2020-01-06T14:12:21  <the-t-in-rtf> he calls it "WASK"ing, and "WASK"s along with the most cacophonous parts
