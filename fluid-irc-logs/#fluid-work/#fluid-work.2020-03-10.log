2020-03-10T05:59:13  <zaidbj> hi shoaib_ ,as from what @the-t-in-rtf  has told me, you need to write up your thoughts on using only keyboard for navigation for about 30 min, including how you are thinking to tackle those probems using chrome ex or electron framework.

2020-03-10T06:01:59  <zaidbj> hope this helps
2020-03-10T06:06:55  <shoaib_> zaidbj:  thanks a lot!!!...where do i get the source code ?
2020-03-10T06:08:33  <zaidbj> there isn't any source code
2020-03-10T06:10:19  <shoaib_> zaidbj: oh okay..thanks!
2020-03-10T06:10:23  <zaidbj> you need to write up your thoughts on how you will be doing the project , and i guess this will be more of  a research based project

2020-03-10T06:16:03  <zaidbj> @the-t-in-rtf also proposed of a solution to relay keystroke from os to the browser, something similar to the working of steam controllers, @the-t-in-rtf is the mentor for this project, you can discuss more about this once he is online(US working hours)
2020-03-10T06:18:23  <zaidbj> as for infusion source code , you can check out this repo-  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion

2020-03-10T13:03:14  <aashimgarg[m]> jhung: what are the additional features that you want on the static site for examle search option from the whole text.
2020-03-10T13:06:13  <jhung> aashimgarg[m] searching is a good feature to have, but privacy is a concern. We do not want data being sent back to a 3rd party (i.e. a Google search widget won't be a good solution).
2020-03-10T13:06:57  <jhung> aashimgarg[m] so whatever search feature we add, it must be done in a way that respects privacy. Ideally it would be a solution we can easily host ourselves.
2020-03-10T13:07:25  <jhung> The docs.fluidproject.org has a search feature and is a static site. You may want to look at that.

2020-03-10T13:08:54  <jhung> Other features we'd want is simple process of authoring, easily reconfigurable (i.e. it should be easy to restructure the site if needed), and build process can be automated.
2020-03-10T13:09:17  <jhung> perhaps gmoss or Justin_o  may have thoughts too

2020-03-10T14:32:05  <sachin10101998> jhung: A search feature completely independent of third party widgets can be developed using JS only to avoid privacy concern. I worked on it in my past year's GSoC project too and I've added it in my draft proposal.

2020-03-10T14:33:19  <sachin10101998> jhung: a similar feature of adding comments too can be added without the use of disqus or any third party apps since they increase load time of the site and data has to be sent to third party apps.
2020-03-10T14:34:20  <sachin10101998> jhung: I have modules already built as separate projects for search and comments to a static site using open source software only.
2020-03-10T14:35:41  <sachin10101998> jhung: I'd send a draft proposal and implementation tricks behind open source search and comment feature without third party integration by the end of week probably for review.

2020-03-10T14:54:43  <Saad> Hey, Cindyli! As you suggested, I looked up the issues on the UIO+ chrome extension. Most of them are feature improvements. I am thinking of adding them in my GSoC proposal as well. There was an issue that caught my eyes about the UIO+ current logo. Someone said it's too small. I am thinking of making a new logo for the extension so I wanted to ask, what kind of logo the extension should have? Like logo represent something, and as far as I have unders
2020-03-10T14:54:43  <Saad> tood from the codebase and extension itself, it's an accessbility extension providing some of the features similar to morphic but on web browsers..

2020-03-10T14:56:57  <Justin_o> Saad:  there's been some discussion about the icon https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oe48dN-3gTdaJgF0XeLT03laHubBHmpMJsbyZyNa2S0/edit
2020-03-10T14:57:09  <Saad> Also, when I was reading Preference Editor documentation, I found some markdown issue there. Pictures were not loading. I thought it was a simple fix considering the page's been written in markdown, I tried to fix it but for some reason, it's not working. I thought I should mention it to you as well about it. Here is the link https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-prefsFramework/CreatingAPrefsEditor.html
2020-03-10T14:57:15  <Justin_o> you should probably talk to jhung if you are thinking about contributing to the icon in particular
2020-03-10T14:59:15  <Justin_o> alanharnum: do you know how the fluidproject website is deployed?
2020-03-10T14:59:23  <Saad> Thank you, Justin! I am reading the discussion now. Also, I am thinking of adding it to my proposal as well since it's related to the project I am planning to work in GSoC.
2020-03-10T14:59:57  <Justin_o> Saad: sure, but that might be an issue that we need to address prior to the GSoC project. However, feel free to add it incase we don't get to it
2020-03-10T15:00:33  <Saad> If that's the case, I should then get to it right away then.
2020-03-10T15:01:54  <sachin10101998> Justin_o: Correct me if I'm wrong but fluidproject is hosted on private servers run by idrc, right?

2020-03-10T15:06:22  <sachin10101998> Justin_o: jhung mentioned that we use webhooks for automatic deployments. Then why didn't Fluid project website update even after few PRs were merged which affected the content of the site?
2020-03-10T15:08:39  <jhung> sachin10101998 thanks for pointing that out. The fluidproject site is one of the exceptions. The webhook is triggered when changes are made to the gh-pages branch. This is an old process that was never changed. Many of the other sites are rebuilt when changes are made to master.
2020-03-10T15:09:47  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I can confirm that there was a rebuild after this commit was merged: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/commit/2574c194cd390ea16f2cbd6bff8a749e3548801d
2020-03-10T15:09:52  <gmoss> just checked the CI logs
2020-03-10T15:09:59  <gmoss> jhung: ^^^

2020-03-10T15:11:37  <jhung> sachin10101998 so what happens now is that someone (usually Justin_o or myself) will build the html and manually commit to the gh-pages branch. This isn't a good process and maybe a GSOC project can help address this too.

2020-03-10T15:19:01  <sachin10101998> jhung I already sensed this issue and was trying to address this issue in my draft proposal. This problem can be solved if choose Jekyll as our static site generator since it's readily gh-pages compatible and every commit triggers a new build and the site is updated.

2020-03-10T15:32:01  <jhung> sachin10101998 Yes that's the desire. The more that can be automated the better.
2020-03-10T15:33:40  <sachin10101998> jhung last question. Are we already using an automation server like jenkins or travis in other projects which build automatically for CI? If yes, which one?
2020-03-10T15:37:00  <jhung> sachin10101998 the floeproject uses automation properly. I am not sure what integration service is being used though. gmoss do you know what is being used?
2020-03-10T15:37:16  <gmoss> jhung: we're using Jenkins, currently

2020-03-10T16:04:40  <sachin10101998> jhung if you manually build the fluidproject website and commit changes to gh-pages branch and the site is updated, that means that the fluidproject website is hosted using gh-pages. Then why did Justin_o said that we use private servers for hosting it?
2020-03-10T16:05:19  <jhung> sachin10101998 the automation actually seems to be broken.
2020-03-10T16:06:28  <jhung> we're trying to figure out why it's broken (is it accidental or intentional?), and how do we fix it.

2020-03-10T16:08:35  <jhung> sachin10101998 broken as in nothing is triggered regardless of the branch. We know this because changes in master haven't been pushed to production. Also there's an error in the encoded URLs in gh-pages branch which aren't seen on the production site. So we know that the automation isn't working.

2020-03-10T17:27:27  <the-t-in-rtf> You should read up a bit.
2020-03-10T17:27:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Infusion actually uses jQuery
2020-03-10T17:27:35  <the-t-in-rtf> in part
2020-03-10T17:27:43  <sachin10101998> dmahajan980 We are already using third party jquery
2020-03-10T17:28:02  <sachin10101998> exactly the-t-in-rtf
2020-03-10T17:28:06  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you don't need to bring that in per se.
2020-03-10T17:28:40  <the-t-in-rtf> For other libraries, we usually review that as part of the pull, but it's good to talk up front.
2020-03-10T17:28:42  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf @sachin10101998 Pardon me! I am not done with reading Infusion, so I wasn't sure about it.
2020-03-10T17:29:10  <the-t-in-rtf> For big decisions where someone will have to support a library, we talk through the alternatives and make the case based on how well the library suits our needs, how well supported it is, etc.
2020-03-10T17:29:38  <the-t-in-rtf> For smaller projects you would probably have more flexibility, but it's still a good idea to talk about what you're thinking
2020-03-10T17:29:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I have to admit that many times I have used libraries and then discovered that Infusion already had a pattern for handling a given problem
2020-03-10T17:30:23  <the-t-in-rtf> Thankfully the documentation is searchable now, so it's slightly harder to miss things.
2020-03-10T17:31:12  <the-t-in-rtf> but it's still good just to mention what you're thinking, share links to libraries

2020-03-10T17:33:33  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf I was actually trying to do some navigation from my gamepad and writing some code for producing the functionality. I got stuck at opening a dropdown using normal JavaScript methods which JQuery seems to handle well.

2020-03-10T17:35:29  <gmoss> sachin10101998: indeed, the last build attempt failed. it looks like the Docpad issue that Justin_o has solved

2020-03-10T17:43:01  <sachin10101998> gmoss Justin_o if there's no build log for the recent builds, then the problem lies in webhook settings and not in ci-jobs.
2020-03-10T17:43:22  <gmoss> sachin10101998: that seems plausible
2020-03-10T17:43:33  <the-t-in-rtf> @zaidbj[m], I would strongly suggest starting by going through a few infusion tutorials.
2020-03-10T17:43:44  <the-t-in-rtf> That's probably better at this stage.
2020-03-10T17:44:25  <zaidbj[m]> I am doing the same, just wanted to ask if I should get familiar with electron as well
2020-03-10T17:45:24  <the-t-in-rtf> It wouldn't hurt, but I wouldn't go much further than reading the docs and trying a short tutorial.
2020-03-10T17:45:38  <the-t-in-rtf> (the electron docs, I mean)

2020-03-10T17:48:31  <sachin10101998> Docpad run halts with docpad generate --env static
2020-03-10T17:57:25  <gmoss> sachin10101998: thanks, we'll look into that! we'll keep looking into the CI situation in the meantime and hopefully have a solution soon, so we can see everyone's latest contributions

2020-03-10T19:37:01  <sgithens> Bosmon8 stegru I guess we never ended up using the IP filters for any of the pilots?
2020-03-10T19:37:16  <sgithens> Is there any plan to make use of it coming up?
2020-03-10T19:37:39  <sgithens> I'm looking through the client credentials on stage/prod and thinking about the one for the capture tool
2020-03-10T19:37:57  <sgithens> just curious, I don't anticipate using any IP stuff

2020-03-10T20:00:34  <sgithens> well, we added this `"allowedIPBlocks": null,` field to clientCredentials to allow only connecting from certain IP ranges, but if you haven't seen it lately, then I'm sure we have no intent of using it

2020-03-10T20:21:12  <Justin_o> gmoss, alanharnum: I'm thinking the gh-pages branch isn't used for the fluid project website anymore.. at least according to https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/website-fluidproject.org.yml
2020-03-10T20:21:15  <Justin_o> is that correct?
2020-03-10T20:22:25  <Justin_o> secondly we need to modify these two lines https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/website-fluidproject.org.yml#L17-L18
2020-03-10T20:22:52  <Justin_o> to just be `npm run generate`
2020-03-10T20:35:31  <gmoss> Justin_o: that sounds plausible, I don't know enough about the Jenkins API at this point to say with certainty. This situation seems to be scratching something deep in my memory, I'll let you know if I can retrieve it
2020-03-10T20:36:58  <Justin_o> gmoss, alanharnum: I have a PR for the CI scripts https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/pull/40

2020-03-10T20:37:11  <gmoss> the second update seems reasonable, though I wonder if what sachin10101998 pointed out will still affect things, since the `generate` task seems to contain the `--env static` bit
2020-03-10T20:37:16  <gmoss> Justin_o: taking a look
2020-03-10T20:37:17  <Justin_o> from the script it looks like it's pulling from master and doing a build. I'm going to delete he gh-pages branch for the repo
2020-03-10T20:39:24  <gmoss> Justin_o: the PR looks reasonable to me
