2019-11-14T13:44:39  <cindyli> morning, Bosmon
2019-11-14T13:53:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: in relation to fluid-6426 I notice that there are many places where we are prefetching the sub panel options... I'm thinking that rather than doing that repeatedly, to store it in a member on the composite panel and just refer to the prefetched values from there. Is there any issue with doing that?
2019-11-14T13:53:54  <Bosmon> Justin_o - what do you mean by "prefetching"?
2019-11-14T13:55:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L298-L306
2019-11-14T13:55:59  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so terrible
2019-11-14T13:56:02  <Bosmon> I'd just leave it : P
2019-11-14T13:56:09  <Justin_o> okay
2019-11-14T13:56:11  <Justin_o> haha
2019-11-14T13:56:25  <Justin_o> I guess it won't be worse that it already is, if we just leave it
2019-11-14T13:58:20  <Bosmon> We shouldn't really spend more than the bare minimum of effort on this code to get us over the hump
2019-11-14T13:58:23  <Bosmon> It is beyond saving : P
2019-11-14T13:58:41  <Justin_o> it's hard to argue with that

2019-11-14T14:21:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. I think I've run into another problem. So the rebasing of the selectors from the sub panel needs access to the sub panel's container selector. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L516
2019-11-14T14:21:44  *** danielcho <danielcho!~Adium@hmtnon1497w-130-02-65-95-64-90.dsl.bell.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2019-11-14T14:21:55  <Justin_o> that way we can scope the selectors inside of the sub panels container, so that we don't accidentally break out and effect other panels.
2019-11-14T14:22:26  <Justin_o> however, if I access the container property from the components block, it may be an IoC expression..
2019-11-14T14:22:53  <Justin_o> if I access the composite panel's selectors, they seem to already evaluate and don't accept the merge from the grade I'm synthesizing
2019-11-14T14:22:56  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-11-14T14:23:41  <Bosmon> Justin_o - how is the situation different from where we executed this via onCreate?
2019-11-14T14:24:53  <Bosmon> Justin_o - Ok, I guess I can see what is happening :(
2019-11-14T14:25:25  <Bosmon> All the selectors are munged together inside options.selectors in the composite panel's options?
2019-11-14T14:25:48  <Bosmon> And we need to consume some of these whilst at the same time we are trying to contribute to them?
2019-11-14T14:27:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep that's basically the situation
2019-11-14T14:28:04  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2019-11-14T14:28:11  <Justin_o> we need to know the selectors used for the containers of the sub panels
2019-11-14T14:28:43  <Bosmon> What you can try is rather than trying to consume the selectors via {that}.options.selectors, to force the framework to just evaluate the ones you need
2019-11-14T14:29:05  <Bosmon> via selectorIWant = fluid.getForComponent(that, ["options", "selectors", name])
2019-11-14T14:30:19  <Bosmon> It's true that if you send "{that}.options.selectors" in as a direct argument to the expander it will consider it fully evaluated and not attempt to consider the contents of the expander once it arrives
2019-11-14T14:31:06  <Bosmon> If this doesn't work I think we will probably just have to give up on this idea of immutable options until we can axe the prefs framework : P
2019-11-14T14:31:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah.. could I just pass in "{that}" and access that.options.selectors internally.. would that be safe?
2019-11-14T14:31:27  <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, no good
2019-11-14T14:31:30  <Bosmon> Because you will see it unevaluated
2019-11-14T14:31:43  <Bosmon> But yes, you will need to pass in {that} otherwise you can't get anything done
2019-11-14T14:32:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also we have the components block passed into the function. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L403

2019-11-14T14:32:59  <Justin_o> would it be possible and safer to expand the container property from each component?
2019-11-14T14:33:38  <Bosmon> Justin_o - could do that, but a bit tricky because of the special status of "container" in the old framework
2019-11-14T14:34:10  <Bosmon> And it will only amount to the same thing in the end since the framework will have to do the same work of special expansion
2019-11-14T14:34:23  <Bosmon> In any case, a call to fluid.getForComponent is hugely preferable to a call to fluid.expandOptions
2019-11-14T14:34:32  <Bosmon> The former just schedules work that was always going to be done anyway
2019-11-14T14:34:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, I'll give that a go
2019-11-14T14:34:53  <Justin_o> thanks

2019-11-14T14:38:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I seem to be getting the same problem
2019-11-14T14:38:36  <Bosmon> :(
2019-11-14T14:39:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to add this with an IoC expression?
2019-11-14T14:39:42  <Justin_o> or maybe an expander?
2019-11-14T14:39:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, so here's a final idea
2019-11-14T14:39:59  <Bosmon> Rather than adding one big expander, try to add a bunch of little expanders, one for each selector you want to generate
2019-11-14T14:40:09  <Bosmon> And supply it exactly the arguments it needs as IoC expressions
2019-11-14T14:40:17  <Justin_o> okay, good.. I was just thinking of that too
2019-11-14T14:41:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so I'm thinking in my synthesized grade, I'll create a selectors block that has an expander for each injected selector that takes in the composite panel's selector as an argument
2019-11-14T14:43:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that seems right
