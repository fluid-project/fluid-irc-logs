2019-11-01T13:13:40  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I've rolled a fresh FLUID-6148 dev release 3.0.0-dev.20191031T204937Z.333e99049.FLUID-6148 which is fully merged up with trunk

2019-11-01T13:18:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: excellent thanks :) I'll update that into UIO+. I can't remember do we typically do PRs for just the dependency update?
2019-11-01T13:21:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you have any thoughts on the comment I left on this JIRA? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6420

2019-11-01T17:11:37  <sgithens> cindyli: All the oauth stuff we have is currently using for authorizing machines in labs and users on them right?  Or is that even oauth?
2019-11-01T17:12:30  <sgithens> We don't have any demo's or implementations of the scenerios anymore that involve a 3rd party service, like facebook or a wordpress site being given access to your preferences do we?

2019-11-01T17:19:30  <cindyli> sgithens: correct. oauth for 3rd party service support has been removed from the code base. we only have the oauth for authorizing machines that have GPII installed
2019-11-01T17:20:03  <sgithens> cindyli: Cool, thanks!

2019-11-01T20:05:22  <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli : There hasn't been any other work going on in the project for users to log in with a username and password outside of my PPT work and universal 2966 branch right?
2019-11-01T20:05:53  <sgithens> and there hasn't been any sort of things that try to authenticate a user when they open a web link from a Morphic QSS web link?
2019-11-01T20:06:12  <sgithens> just double checking before I send this email ;)
2019-11-01T20:08:07  <cindyli> sgithens: i'm not aware of any of such work outside of your pull requests
2019-11-01T20:08:38  <sgithens> cindyli: Great thanks!
2019-11-01T20:08:56  <sgithens> and nothing to like authenticate things automatically from the quickstrip
2019-11-01T20:09:01  <sgithens> outside of it's own save button
