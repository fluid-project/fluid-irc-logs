2019-04-09T08:26:37  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens we can't meaningfully change it and there's no good way of knowing the acceptable values.  I have warnings for missing schemas at the moment, eventually we should talk about either adding very crude rules based on transforms and test data, or simply purging some of the older solutions as unsupported.
2019-04-09T08:26:50  <the-t-in-rtf> Then we could require schemas for all the things.

2019-04-09T12:53:08  <jhernandez> ok, so
2019-04-09T12:53:56  <jhernandez> having a problem here with highContrast + language
2019-04-09T12:55:43  <jhernandez> after you switch language, the high contrast theme does not change, it only enables/disables and always uses the whiteOnBlack theme
2019-04-09T12:56:35  <jhernandez> when you're back in the default language, then high contrast works just fine

2019-04-09T12:59:51  <jhernandez> so, I'd say it's something related to the "bodge" priority fix and how we configure high contrast
2019-04-09T13:04:07  <jhernandez> oh, and JJ's yesterday fix is not guilty for that

2019-04-09T14:02:10  <greatislander> Sounds good colinclark!
2019-04-09T14:03:00  <colinclark> awesome
2019-04-09T14:04:56  <alanharnum> greatislander colinclark jhung: flipping around channels, sorry - we were going to meet at 1:30 to discuss wordpress infra stuff
2019-04-09T14:05:19  <alanharnum> if you're going to talk about CMS options this afternoon, we should perhaps defer or combine those meetings
2019-04-09T14:06:47  <alanharnum> colinclark greatislander: I can do any time this afternoon - the CISL meeting has been cancelled, so I'm pretty much clear. I have to run to take my cats to the vet shortly, just let me know

2019-04-09T17:52:40  <jhernandez> we figured out things
2019-04-09T17:52:46  <stegru> ok, good
2019-04-09T17:53:03  <jhernandez> but not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel yet
2019-04-09T17:53:34  <jhernandez> so, high contrast theme changes only work in the default language
2019-04-09T17:54:15  <bryan_> sgithens: our usual time is 1pm...can you do that time?
2019-04-09T17:54:33  <stegru> yes, because windows wants the localised name of the theme
2019-04-09T17:54:34  <jhernandez> after you switch language, you can only enable/disable high contrast
2019-04-09T17:54:36  <jhernandez> yes
2019-04-09T17:54:48  <jhernandez> and we're there, trying to figure out how to ask Windows for the right string
2019-04-09T17:55:25  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/260/files#diff-e388fb861fe79246f42dc8de824ec1b0R562
2019-04-09T17:56:41  <jhernandez> yeah
2019-04-09T17:56:54  <jhernandez> but it's always coming in english language
2019-04-09T17:57:01  <stegru> oh ffs
2019-04-09T17:57:05  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: such a master move there
2019-04-09T17:57:21  <stegru> is this on 1809?
2019-04-09T17:57:34  <jhernandez> yes
2019-04-09T17:57:44  <sgithens> bryan_: Sure, I think my other meeting should be done by then
2019-04-09T17:58:25  <bryan_> Ok sounds good
2019-04-09T18:00:12  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: yes, it's we are going to change the index that you are using in your code in favor of another one
2019-04-09T18:00:21  <javjarfer[m]> just checking if it's enough
2019-04-09T18:01:27  <stegru> ok sorry if I'm slowing you down by making you explain things to me :)

2019-04-09T18:03:49  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: ehhh not the case because your existing code has speed the debugging several times
2019-04-09T18:04:04  <javjarfer[m]> we were going to use a much more crappy API you were using
2019-04-09T18:04:30  <jhernandez> stegru: it's fine, we have a "guess"
2019-04-09T18:12:02  <stegru> ohh.. jhernandez javjarfer[m], I know why it doesn't work - the new language only applies to new processes
2019-04-09T18:12:20  <stegru> so it will always be in english!
2019-04-09T18:14:29  <stegru> i used a child process in the past for this
2019-04-09T18:14:54  <jhernandez> ok
2019-04-09T18:15:16  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: that's a great, we have a fix then
2019-04-09T18:15:29  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-localisation/src/language.js#L193
2019-04-09T18:15:32  <stegru> ok good
2019-04-09T18:15:48  <jhernandez> that was one of our suspicious, that we, as a running process, will always get the same string back
2019-04-09T18:17:11  <stegru> storing a setting in a localised string makes me wonder how you could have a highcontrast theme and change the language even using the normal methods
