2019-01-22T16:32:14  <javjarfer[m]> so basically the settings are composed of several switches that are encoded in binary masks
2019-01-22T16:32:50  <javjarfer[m]> so, they are a map of "several switches" -> number

2019-01-22T17:38:13  <Bosmon> Have you started to grapple with sgithens pull for the Capture tool?

2019-01-22T18:08:38  <sgithens> the last 2 pages of the wizard are still going through some UX changes, and I'm still waiting to hear back if "currently running" applications means windows settings or not
2019-01-22T18:09:13  <sgithens> the universal component of the snapshotter GPII-228 certainly could use some eyes from anyone with knowledge of SPI stuff
2019-01-22T18:09:22  <sgithens> because currently it breaks on capturing SPI settings
2019-01-22T18:09:55  <bryan_> Let me know if there is something you'd like me to work on

2019-01-22T18:50:13  <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli anyone:  Does the kettle.test.request.http we use for most of our http tests carry a session on it's own if you use it in multiple steps of the IoC test sequence?  I'm working on some perms tests, and trying to load a page before and after I send the login credentials will be part of the sequence steps
