2018-11-27T13:07:50  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon , thanks you, I will remove the transform as it looks it's no longer needed
2018-11-27T13:08:34  <javjarfer[m]> also, does anyone of you Bosmon , or stegru , why the transform is also present in GPII-3145?https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-3145/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6502
2018-11-27T13:08:58  <javjarfer[m]> I can't remember if I introduced it there for something in particular
2018-11-27T13:09:32  <javjarfer[m]> But I can't really think in anything of why is it needed
2018-11-27T13:09:55  <stegru> it was you, javjarfer[m] - https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/commit/cfa0ce6e24d124d2604ae28d55a585e184d6d8f8
2018-11-27T13:10:16  <Bosmon> it was you!
2018-11-27T13:10:21  <javjarfer[m]> yes, yes, it was me, but I don't know why I did it xD
2018-11-27T13:10:29  <stegru> oh ffs
2018-11-27T13:10:30  <Bosmon> Note that in all cases you can abbreviate literalValue "transforms" by just using the key "literalValue"
2018-11-27T13:10:43  <Bosmon> e.g. https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-3145/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L2488
2018-11-27T13:11:26  <javjarfer[m]> that's much more nicer, thanks you Bosmon , will do that
2018-11-27T13:11:29  <Bosmon> Ok indeed, well do clean up the mouse button swapping in your pull as well
2018-11-27T13:12:29  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_ste "oh ffs"> indeed
2018-11-27T13:13:28  <javjarfer[m]> as it looks that there is no need for that transform I will be cleaning up the pull of it
2018-11-27T13:15:27  <javjarfer[m]> correct me if I'm wrong Bosmon if the matchmaker selects a solution the settings are not filled with empty values and passed to the setting handler if they are not present true'

2018-11-27T13:16:26  <javjarfer[m]> then that is the reason for the transform to exist
2018-11-27T13:16:49  <javjarfer[m]> If not, all that settings should be split into multiple solutions
2018-11-27T13:17:45  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I don't understand you
2018-11-27T13:19:51  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: maybe I haven't understand the answer, so you said me, that the settings handler is not called with the empty settings  that the user has not select from a particular solution
2018-11-27T13:22:35  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - if there is no value in "SwapMouseButtons" then this settings handler is not going to be called at all

2018-11-27T14:06:55  <dandimitrov> Hey, jhernandez, I forgot to ask yesterday, have you had any troubles running the Electron 3 code? I experienced a problem with missing node_modules such as “gpii-universal”. Have you seen something similar?
2018-11-27T14:34:13  <alanharnum> server maintenance is finished, one issue I'm currently investigating (the VM that hosts https://ci.fluidproject.org/ is nonresponsive)
2018-11-27T14:34:20  <alanharnum> please let me know if you see any issues
2018-11-27T14:37:15  <javjarfer[m]> Sorry Bosmon , are you still around?
2018-11-27T14:38:46  <javjarfer[m]> I forgot to ask you a question regarding to a review I have from you, and a conversation I had yesterday with the-t-in-rtf , in which he suggested us a new schema for a setting specification
2018-11-27T14:39:53  <Bosmon> hi
2018-11-27T14:42:38  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: hey, nothing relevant so far with electron 3
2018-11-27T14:42:51  <jhernandez> (besides the delay we talked about yesterday)
2018-11-27T14:43:36  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: ensure to delete the node_modules folder AND the package-lock.json before running npm install
2018-11-27T14:44:50  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: in any case, which branch are you working on? should I give it a try?
2018-11-27T14:53:27  <javjarfer[m]> hi there Bosmon !
2018-11-27T14:53:52  <javjarfer[m]> So as you can see, the spec for this setting has changed since the inclusion of the new schema: https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-3145/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6535
2018-11-27T14:56:21  <stegru> dandimitrov , I've also had trouble with gpii-universal.. I just added a reference to it in package.json
2018-11-27T14:56:26  <javjarfer[m]> To my understanding, we should honor this schemas as much as possible, so, now, the transforms should not include any kind of bound checks or provide any special convenience value, to select the special meaning of the setting
2018-11-27T14:56:34  <javjarfer[m]> Because that information is already provided in the schema
2018-11-27T14:59:54  <jhung> fluid-everyone: there is no design crit today.
2018-11-27T15:01:18  <jhernandez> stegru: you added the ref to universal to the gpii-app's package.json file? if so, why?
2018-11-27T15:01:36  <stegru> to make it work, jhernandez :)
2018-11-27T15:01:49  <stegru> it complained about gpii-universal not being found
2018-11-27T15:02:08  <stegru> I just put a sticker over the warning light
2018-11-27T15:02:12  <jhernandez> did you removed node_modules folder and package-lock.json file before re-npm installing?
2018-11-27T15:02:23  <Bosmon> stegru - I thought that dandimitrov etc. resolved that by requesting gpii-windows instead
2018-11-27T15:02:25  <jhernandez> stegru: heh, okay
2018-11-27T15:02:29  <Bosmon> Perhaps their stuff isn't merged yet
2018-11-27T15:02:34  <stegru> maybe not the lock file
2018-11-27T15:02:50  <Bosmon> It's just an annoyance to have universal in gpii-app since it just means that we have two giant version numbers to paste rather than one
2018-11-27T15:03:07  <stegru> oh yes, I know.. but i just wanted the thing to run
2018-11-27T15:03:29  <Bosmon> ok
2018-11-27T15:06:02  <jhernandez> I have to say that, even though I don't know the reason, npm does weird things when you npm install after updating your refs in the package.json file from npm to git and viceversa - and when I have hit this kind of weird can't load gpii-universal errors, the problem went away after deleting both node_modules and package-lock.json

2018-11-27T16:16:17  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: hmm, interesting
2018-11-27T16:16:45  <jhernandez> so, it works normally when you run npm start and it fails when running a grunt (npm maybe?) task?
2018-11-27T16:17:07  <dandimitrov> yep, `npm run build`
2018-11-27T16:17:20  <jhernandez> okay, let me try it here
2018-11-27T16:18:41  <dandimitrov> jhernandez: And a side note, the problem on my side with Electron 3 seemed to be relevant to the problem that was reported for the Grunt task (gpii-universal missing)
2018-11-27T16:18:58  <dandimitrov> And for some reason `npm install` doesn’t install any top-level gpii-universal module (which it previously did) on my vm now…
2018-11-27T16:19:40  <jhernandez> hm
2018-11-27T16:19:46  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: are you using a custom git ref?
2018-11-27T16:19:48  <dandimitrov> Probably it has to do with package-lock.json as you mentioned
2018-11-27T16:19:55  <jhernandez> maybe
2018-11-27T16:20:02  <jhernandez> npm run build works fine for me
2018-11-27T16:20:46  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: please, delete both node_modules and package-lock.json and re-run npm install
2018-11-27T16:20:50  <jhernandez> let me know how it goes
2018-11-27T16:20:57  <dandimitrov> I haven’t included the code for the Grunt task yet because of the error
2018-11-27T16:21:19  <jhernandez> ok ok, no problem
2018-11-27T16:21:22  <alanharnum> ci.fluidproject.org should be back - its host VM had a yum update interruption that left it configured to use new kernel, but without all the necessary kernel files. Uninstallation and reinstallation of newest kernel via yum eventually fixed it.
2018-11-27T16:21:37  <dandimitrov> would you try editting the Gruntfile and adding a `require(“gpii-windows”)` line in the task for the messages compiling
2018-11-27T16:24:06  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: it is not already there?
2018-11-27T16:24:41  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L46
2018-11-27T16:25:57  <dandimitrov> jhernandez: no, the suggested approach was using `require(“gpii-windows”);  fluid.require(“%gpii-universal)` as gpii-universal isn’t a direct dependency of the gpii-app
2018-11-27T16:26:32  <dandimitrov> but it fails on requiring `gpii-windows`
2018-11-27T16:28:43  <Bosmon> hmm
2018-11-27T16:28:59  <Bosmon> I guess all of the binaries in the tree are really wrt. electron's ABI
2018-11-27T16:30:00  <Bosmon> Perhaps there's no reason to expect *any* particular version of released node to correspond to them
2018-11-27T16:30:10  <Bosmon> But one would have thought that going for napi versions of everything would resolve this issue

2018-11-27T16:44:04  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - well the issue is that all the native modules in your tree were built against Electron
2018-11-27T16:44:08  <jhernandez> okay

2018-11-27T17:32:04  <jhernandez> Bosmon: I'm looking into the problem and I'm wondering whether we should make the messagesBundleCompiler a script that can be called from electron rather than grunt
2018-11-27T17:33:04  <jhernandez> in the same way we call, let's say, the tests, https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/package.json#L45
2018-11-27T17:35:58  <Bosmon> jhernandez sure yes, why not
2018-11-27T17:39:33  <jhernandez> I'm also seeing that there is one "grunt-electron" package, but I'm not sure if we really need it
2018-11-27T17:39:48  <Bosmon> jhernandez - +1 for a plain electron script
2018-11-27T17:39:59  <jhernandez> yeh
