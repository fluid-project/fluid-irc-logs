2019-03-19T09:31:07  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning @Bosmon.
2019-03-19T09:31:31  <the-t-in-rtf> Just pondering how to implement the "filtered megaschema" validation middleware
2019-03-19T09:31:55  <the-t-in-rtf> kind of a philisophical question about where that should live
2019-03-19T09:32:08  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume that all the settings checking is OK to stay in the new solutionsRegistry module for now?
2019-03-19T09:32:36  <Bosmon> We can keep the validation in the new SR module too
2019-03-19T09:32:49  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's what I meant
2019-03-19T09:33:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I think the schemas for other specific endpoints might need to live in other sub-modules
2019-03-19T09:33:10  <Bosmon> sure
2019-03-19T09:33:15  <the-t-in-rtf> if we end up having to use similar patterns across them then we can discuss making a validation module.
2019-03-19T09:33:33  <the-t-in-rtf> but I think I can just drop in the new validation middleware for everything but settings
2019-03-19T09:33:50  <the-t-in-rtf> thankfully because the component is per-request, I can handle the filtering with an invoker
2019-03-19T09:33:57  <the-t-in-rtf> so I just need a small component for the settings middleware
2019-03-19T09:34:02  <the-t-in-rtf> everything else can just use options.
2019-03-19T09:34:55  <the-t-in-rtf> we might need another variant for the prefs safe, but it should be 1-2 small functions to back the invoker, not terrible
2019-03-19T09:37:37  <the-t-in-rtf> by filtering I mean, having the validation limit itself to the settings in the payload, the approach we discussed yesterday
2019-03-19T10:00:52  <the-t-in-rtf> so, the prefs safe schema is going to have to be so closely related that it seems like it should also just live in the SR sub-module.
2019-03-19T10:01:38  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it contains the settings schema entirely.
2019-03-19T10:01:58  <the-t-in-rtf> the others probably do belong near their endpoints.

2019-03-19T12:39:07  <jhernandez> and in general, works great

2019-03-19T12:39:24  <jhernandez> :P
2019-03-19T12:39:37  <jhernandez> I took some notes during my testing
2019-03-19T12:40:28  <jhernandez> would you like to have a call later to talk about it?

2019-03-19T17:45:55  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Looking forward to this validation stuff.  Most of the actual function is in gpii-json-schema and then we'll be calling from the various points all aroudn the system to validate is that right?
2019-03-19T17:46:16  <sgithens> I'd like to try it out in the PPT to validate the side editing widget with the actual schema's in the sol registry
2019-03-19T17:46:55  <the-t-in-rtf> well, the validators are in gpii-json-schema
2019-03-19T17:47:05  <the-t-in-rtf> the actual rules (schemas) are in universal, in my pull
2019-03-19T17:47:11  <the-t-in-rtf> you could in theory try them out with things now
2019-03-19T17:47:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I just generalised some of the key bits, namely the "filtered megaschema" approach
2019-03-19T17:47:58  <sgithens> are these schemas though for other larger payloads, like the prefssafe format in general though? The schema's for individual settings have been in the sol reg for a bit now, ast least for new onboarded items right?
2019-03-19T17:48:10  <the-t-in-rtf> the full SR-derived settings schema is too large to be performant, I have a means of filtering for just the settings in the payload
2019-03-19T17:48:36  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I am testing with the prefs in testData/preferences
2019-03-19T17:48:42  <sgithens> right on

2019-03-19T19:05:56  <sgithens> cindyli1: So we don't put `isError` on our error blocks anymore? I thought that was a standard thing you could test a return payload against to see if it was an error.
2019-03-19T19:06:09  <sgithens> Maybe I'm just dreaming and that was a convention I made up
2019-03-19T19:07:44  <cindyli1> sgithens: you are totally correct that "isError" is always included in the error responses, although they are usually added by request handler components
2019-03-19T19:07:58  <cindyli1> see preferencesGetHandler.js
2019-03-19T19:08:04  <cindyli1> or putHandler
2019-03-19T19:08:30  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2019-03-19T19:08:45  <sgithens> cindyli1: So you wouldn't want to be able to use that field if you were putting together a scripting pipeline or batch job that called the API's ?
2019-03-19T19:09:00  <sgithens> only if you're going over the external HTTP routes?
2019-03-19T19:09:40  <sgithens> I understand moving the raw HTTP code to just the handlers, that makes sense
2019-03-19T19:18:26  <cindyli> sgithens: very good question. my understanding is isError only appears in http error responses. but i could be wrong

2019-03-19T22:20:36  <stegru> jhernandez - been looking into the high-contrast problem, and I've not had any success
2019-03-19T22:21:04  <stegru> tomorrow I'll just read the colours from the theme files and set them manually - it will take less time than what I've already spent on it
2019-03-19T22:21:59  <stegru> (I mean, I'll write the code to do that)
