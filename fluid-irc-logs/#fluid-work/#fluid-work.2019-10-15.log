2019-10-15T07:12:04  <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon !
2019-10-15T07:12:39  <javjarfer[m]> Do you know where I can start looking for a transform that is being filtered but I don't know why?
2019-10-15T07:17:07  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~yanachkov@185.97.75.80> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2019-10-15T07:26:57  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - what do you mean by filtered?
2019-10-15T07:27:42  <javjarfer[m]> The setting doesn't get selected, even If I can see in the logs that the payload from the user is correct
2019-10-15T07:27:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - what do you mean by the setting? : P
2019-10-15T07:30:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: haha, well, the input path of the transform seems correct, and the payload have that input path, but the setting handler which should be called with the result of that transform for that input path, is never called
2019-10-15T07:32:52  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, surely you need to check the output payload of the transform first?
2019-10-15T07:33:46  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~yanachkov@185.97.75.80> has joined #fluid-work
2019-10-15T07:35:18  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: that should be here true? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/matchMakerFramework/src/MatchMakerUtilities.js#L181
2019-10-15T07:35:30  <Bosmon> Yes, there
2019-10-15T07:38:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Thanks!
2019-10-15T08:36:41  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: looks like the issue is that nothing is being selected
2019-10-15T08:36:47  * javjarfer[m] uploaded an image: image.png (25KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TlknDEfBXrVVGcVQYIrdISqu >
2019-10-15T08:37:13  <javjarfer[m]> the result of the transform is empty, but it's also empty with any other transform I have tried
2019-10-15T08:40:36  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - so it doesn't appear in the output of transformWithRules at all?
2019-10-15T08:43:36  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: it doesn't
2019-10-15T08:43:42  * javjarfer[m] uploaded an image: image.png (20KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/IFsKPsWCWnWtHenRSSecTWxw >
2019-10-15T08:44:17  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, what does your transform look like?
2019-10-15T08:46:05  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: It also does the same with other transforms, but I'm going to upload the last changes and paste it here
2019-10-15T08:48:37  <javjarfer[m]> I fear that it's something related with the input path, but I'm not sure
2019-10-15T10:52:32  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: here you can check the transform https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10507
2019-10-15T10:55:22  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - perhaps the reason it is failing is because the transform doesn't get its path contributed into inputPaths?
2019-10-15T10:55:23  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L398
2019-10-15T10:55:28  <Bosmon> What grades have you registered it with?
2019-10-15T10:55:38  <Bosmon> You can see the various strategies that are used to deduce input paths in this function
2019-10-15T10:55:50  <Bosmon> Although this wouldn't explain why you get no output
2019-10-15T10:55:54  <Bosmon> Can you link to your impl?
2019-10-15T10:56:06  <Bosmon> If you put a breakpoint in your impl, do you see it activated?
2019-10-15T11:02:57  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: here is the impl https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/gpii/node_modules/transformer/src/js/Transformer.js#L302
2019-10-15T11:03:28  <javjarfer[m]> breakpoints don't get triggered
2019-10-15T11:03:32  <javjarfer[m]> it's never called
2019-10-15T11:03:51  <javjarfer[m]> (the impl is wrong, needs to be changed, but I just wanted to know why isn't being called)
2019-10-15T11:03:51  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - your inversion function is wrong
2019-10-15T11:04:14  <Bosmon> Compare it against other inversion functions
2019-10-15T11:04:22  <Bosmon> The inversion inverts the configuration, not the transform
2019-10-15T11:04:57  <Bosmon> This is why the member is carefully named "invertConfiguration" : P
2019-10-15T11:06:29  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I see, so, that could be a reason on why it's not called? I recall removing the invertConfiguration and causing no effect into being called or not
2019-10-15T11:06:43  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - no, it is probably not the cause of the current problem
2019-10-15T11:06:53  <Bosmon> So, you confirm you get as far as this line - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/matchMakerFramework/src/MatchMakerUtilities.js#L181 ?
2019-10-15T11:08:15  <Bosmon> What are the contents of solutionIdObj and transformSpec at this point?
2019-10-15T11:09:19  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - although my suspicion is that you are looking at the wrong site totally
2019-10-15T11:09:22  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes I can reach that line
2019-10-15T11:09:28  <Bosmon> Firstly you should check that this site is working properly: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/transformer/src/js/Transformer.js#L137
2019-10-15T11:09:57  <Bosmon> Or most importantly, that the hasSupportedSetting check passes

2019-10-15T11:21:55  <kris_HA> Hi :))
2019-10-15T11:22:01  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, this indeed suggests to me you are looking in the wrong place
2019-10-15T11:22:11  <kris_HA> @Bosmon: If we will have a Mac version of the gpii app, should automation tests need to work both on Windows and Mac?
2019-10-15T11:22:24  <Bosmon> kris_HA - yes, eventually they should ....
2019-10-15T11:22:47  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - you don't have a common term for your solution so this branch is irrelevant
2019-10-15T11:22:54  <Bosmon> You should be looking in the Transformer instead
2019-10-15T11:24:11  <Bosmon> In any case, this is all good training for you in working up to being our next KASPARDDNIETT :)

2019-10-15T11:29:04  <kris_HA> Is Javascript is mandatory for the AT language or it's good to be because we all have experience with it?
2019-10-15T11:29:33  <Bosmon> kris_HA - it's not mandatory, no
2019-10-15T11:29:46  <Bosmon> For AT you mean that automated testing software, not the accessibility technology? : P
2019-10-15T11:29:53  <kris_HA> yup
2019-10-15T11:29:56  <Bosmon> What testing software is currently under consideration?

2019-10-15T11:46:30  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: you were right, I have been looking into Transformer.js and settingsHandlers are being deleted for the solution here https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/gpii/node_modules/transformer/src/js/Transformer.js#L227
2019-10-15T11:47:20  <javjarfer[m]> <Bosmon "In any case, this is all good tr"> haha I would need more time to check all of this then!
2019-10-15T12:01:52  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I know where the problem could be, but I don't quite understand the cause, here https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/settingsHandlerUtilities.js#L69
2019-10-15T12:03:09  <javjarfer[m]> the setting passed as parameter is "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems" while the supported setting is "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems.$t"
2019-10-15T12:19:08  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, you can adjust the supported setting, right? : P
2019-10-15T12:20:19  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems" is just the input path I use for the transform
2019-10-15T12:22:22  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - then that is likely your supported setting as well
2019-10-15T12:22:53  <Bosmon> Likely we don't want to surface encoding-specific details such as "$t" in the advertised setting name
2019-10-15T12:22:57  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I don't understand I use that path as a proxy to send the correct value to the setting
2019-10-15T12:24:03  <javjarfer[m]> I agree with that, but that has been the case for all the other previous settings exposed using the XMLSettingsHandler
2019-10-15T12:25:53  <javjarfer[m]> also, the proxy technique I said before has been used previously in other solutions, I don't know why it isn't working in this case
2019-10-15T12:29:02  <javjarfer[m]> Have we recently remove the ability to use this proxy-paths to expose settings?

2019-10-15T12:29:51  <javjarfer[m]> if that is the case, this kind of operations should be done using common terms true? I think that's the only alternative

2019-10-15T12:40:43  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i don't have an idea about "proxy-paths", but if you can create a branch to demonstrate the problem, I can help to debug
2019-10-15T12:42:27  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli , what I meant is to use a path as a input path of a transform for a setting, that isn't a common term
2019-10-15T12:42:43  <javjarfer[m]> With the only purpose of hiding some settings details to the user of the setting
2019-10-15T12:46:20  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i don't quite understand what you said about "using an application term would help to hide some settings details"?
2019-10-15T12:46:57  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli , let me find an example, just a sec
2019-10-15T12:47:16  <cindyli> ok. thanks
2019-10-15T12:48:24  <cindyli> btw, is this an example of using an application term in a transformation - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L16143

2019-10-15T13:03:55  <cindyli> javjarfer[m], the transformation below at line 4900 uses the exact same application term, is that correct?
2019-10-15T13:04:50  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli , yes it's
2019-10-15T13:04:59  <cindyli> ok. what's the problem?
2019-10-15T13:08:21  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i'm still confused about how sharing the same app term by 2 settings would work. for example, if the input preference is:
2019-10-15T13:08:23  <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.windows.desktopBackground": {
2019-10-15T13:08:23  <cindyli>     "Scaling": "Fill"
2019-10-15T13:08:23  <cindyli> }
2019-10-15T13:09:52  <cindyli> i see. it will work by generating transformation result of:
2019-10-15T13:09:53  <cindyli> {
2019-10-15T13:09:53  <cindyli>     "TileWallpaper": "0",

2019-10-15T14:37:52  <javjarfer> I thought you were disconnected but looks like Riot, the matrix client I use, have some problem with its servers
2019-10-15T14:38:44  <cindyli> ah, that's why
2019-10-15T14:39:46  <javjarfer> cindyli, yes... I have been in the dark for an hour until a message of "connectivity to the server have been lost" have showed
2019-10-15T14:40:07  <javjarfer> so, I think that your last question was "which was the problem with it"
2019-10-15T14:40:28  <cindyli> ya, that's right
2019-10-15T14:41:15  <javjarfer> cindyli, my problem is that I have wrote a new transform, that I have been using here https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10508
2019-10-15T14:41:35  <javjarfer> the problem is that, the transform is never called
2019-10-15T14:42:08  <cindyli> ok. checking...
2019-10-15T14:42:21  <javjarfer> because the selected setting appears to be "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems", and not "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems.$t"
2019-10-15T14:43:16  <javjarfer> but "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems" is not a setting, is the "inputPath" I used for the transform, the same way I used it in the previous setting for wallpaper that you checked before

2019-10-15T14:53:28  <javjarfer> cindyli, but my intention is that the setting could be used through "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems" so I can transform the array into the proper array the XML settings handler needs to receive
2019-10-15T14:53:52  <javjarfer> if I use the "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems.$t" nothing will be transformed

2019-10-15T14:55:15  <cindyli> e
2019-10-15T14:58:30  <cindyli> javjarfer: is there a reason that you cannot add ".$t" into the input path?
2019-10-15T14:59:55  <javjarfer> cindyli, well... I don't feel like the name of the setting should be the same as the name of the input path for it's transform, that would make end-to-end testing really difficult no?
2019-10-15T15:02:21  <cindyli> javjarfer: i searched thru win32.json5 and didn't find another "capabilitiesTransformations" for a "xxx.$t" setting. I'm not sure what the design purpose of this ".$t" was and I don't have suggestions

2019-10-15T15:03:59  <cindyli> Bosmon, javjarfer: do you know where this ".$t" suffix was originated from?
2019-10-15T15:08:47  <javjarfer> cindyli, yes, I know, it's basically the notation the key of a json value that will be transformed into the value inside a XML element
2019-10-15T15:10:39  <javjarfer> so, if you have a json object that is { "isReady": true, "years": 20, "$t": "Alice" } in XML would be <element isReady="True" years="20">Alice</element>
2019-10-15T15:10:52  <javjarfer> that's the whole purpose of that I think

2019-10-15T15:12:10  <cindyli> thanks, javjarfer. i don't think universal supports the unmatched setting and input path for application terms. 2 solutions off the top of my head:
2019-10-15T15:12:19  <cindyli> 1. add ".$t" into the input path
2019-10-15T15:12:54  <cindyli> 2. add the support for ".$t" mismatch between the setting name and the input path
2019-10-15T15:13:08  <cindyli> i lean towards 1
2019-10-15T15:13:24  <javjarfer> cindyli, sorry, but then why is this transform working? https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L9020
2019-10-15T15:13:37  <javjarfer> is the same approach
2019-10-15T15:14:25  <Bosmon> cindyli - $t just arises naturally from the strategy of our XML to JSON mapping library
2019-10-15T15:15:57  <cindyli> javjarfer: i will verify that transformation
2019-10-15T15:16:59  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you know if this mapping is already supported by the universal? is there a test case to demonstrate how it should be used?
2019-10-15T15:22:33  <cindyli> Bosmon, javjarfer: my search thru the code base doesn't show a helpful test case

2019-10-15T15:27:35  <javjarfer>  cindyli, yes, I recently saw that all the acceptanceTests regarding this settings are not exercising the transforms, but the settings themselves
2019-10-15T15:27:54  <javjarfer> but any preference set for a demoUser will be enough
2019-10-15T15:28:35  <javjarfer> those preference sets are exercising the transforms

2019-10-15T15:37:01  <javjarfer> cindyli, mmm that's interesting, the transform for DuckAudio should be present in naomi.json5 preference set, but looks like it was removed in this commit by the-t-in-rtf https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/commit/12bdc17a3cad10d92e16b1e19ea90dc162a36fa1
2019-10-15T15:44:45  <cindyli> Bosmon, javjarfer, the "xml-mapping" library is used by "gpii.settingsHandlers.XMLHandler" to convert json to xml. but this doesn't seem to require the setting name has ".$t" suffix. if it's decided to have".$t" in the name to distinguish this type of settings, we still could have it as a part of the input path
2019-10-15T15:44:54  <cindyli> Bosmon: what would you suggest?
2019-10-15T15:47:16  <Bosmon> cindyli - well of course we can name the setting what we like, after a transformation step
2019-10-15T15:47:32  <Bosmon> I was just explaining why the setting before transformation includes $t
2019-10-15T15:48:44  <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon
2019-10-15T15:48:47  <cindyli> javjarfer, seems you could remove ".$t" from the setting name - https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10507
2019-10-15T15:54:28  <javjarfer> cindyli, I think what Bosmon is saying is that we can put any name we want after the transform step
2019-10-15T15:54:52  <javjarfer> but the setting itself needs the $, at least in the current impl of the XMLSettingsHandler
2019-10-15T15:55:12  <javjarfer> without it, you are not referring to the actual value that is going to be placed in the XML
2019-10-15T15:57:22  <javjarfer> But I don't know if we have lost the ability to add this transforms, why otherwise would them be removed from naomi.json5 preference set?
2019-10-15T15:57:35  <cindyli> javjarfer: right. but i feel there are some tricks with nested application terms. I need to run some tests to figure out if the universal supports unmatched setting name/path for app terms
2019-10-15T15:58:35  <cindyli> i will keep updated with my findings
2019-10-15T15:58:40  <javjarfer> cindyli, okay, thanks, if we do not longer support this transforms there are many settings we need to change
2019-10-15T15:58:57  <cindyli> :(
2019-10-15T15:58:59  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer, if you look at ControlContextVerbosity as an example of the settings I trimmed from naomi.
2019-10-15T15:59:14  <the-t-in-rtf> then look at win32.json, there wasn't a setting for that any more I believe.
2019-10-15T15:59:34  <the-t-in-rtf> basically I removed anything that didn't match the settings handler, I assumed it was outdated legacy data.
2019-10-15T16:02:30  <javjarfer> cindyli, but I have recently used them for the wallpaper as you saw before, and they are working, and I also have them in this pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/809/files and they are also working from this preference set https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/809/files#diff-860e118987b7791d0e137789a473988a
2019-10-15T16:02:57  <javjarfer> the-t-in-rtf, those are settings that are valid today, https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L9008
2019-10-15T16:04:04  <javjarfer> if you check that link, the setting is exposed through a transform as many others, to improve their readability or to expose them in a easier way
2019-10-15T16:05:28  <cindyli> great to know, javjarfer.
2019-10-15T16:07:55  <javjarfer> cindyli, let me know if I can help
2019-10-15T16:08:12  <cindyli> sure. thanks

2019-10-15T16:15:22  <cindyli> javjarfer: i think i figured out. we do support unmatched setting name with the input path. i believe your problem was because you escaped the dot in between "ApplicationSettings" and "Speech" at this line - https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-4183/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10510
