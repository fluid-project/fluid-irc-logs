2020-09-16T12:11:47  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hello, I've scheduled a GSoC retrospective during our crit time next week.  2pm ET. Are you interested and able to join?
2020-09-16T12:12:49  <the-t-in-rtf> That's right around the time I put my son down usually.
2020-09-16T12:12:56  <the-t-in-rtf> So although I am interested that's challenging.
2020-09-16T12:13:16  <the-t-in-rtf> as I would be making noise even if his mom puts him down, and he has super hearing.
2020-09-16T12:13:28  <the-t-in-rtf> even an hour earlier is much more doable
2020-09-16T12:13:33  <the-t-in-rtf> or a half hour if you think it's a 30 minute discussion
2020-09-16T12:15:44  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I'll see if I can schedule it earlier. I'll check with others today.
2020-09-16T12:15:48  <Justin_o> it would be great to have you there
2020-09-16T12:16:17  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, I'd love to join if I can.
2020-09-16T12:16:42  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: by the way I'm working on updates to eslint-config-fluid and https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/issues/14
2020-09-16T12:18:21  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I was talking with @Bosmon
2020-09-16T12:18:24  <the-t-in-rtf> just a moment.
2020-09-16T12:18:29  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/wiki/Comparison-with-deprecated-JSdoc-related-ESLint-rules
2020-09-16T12:18:49  <the-t-in-rtf> That's a guide to replacing the valid-jsdoc rule with the equivalent from the plugin
2020-09-16T12:19:05  <the-t-in-rtf> my thinking is that we'd just need a pull against fluid-grunt-lint-all to tweak that task
2020-09-16T12:19:52  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'm not working on an infusion project or anything that uses it, so I was hoping you could take it on with advice and review from my end.
2020-09-16T12:20:26  <Justin_o> yep, I should have something for you to look at today actually, if you are around for a bit. I've spent some time over the past few days tracking down some issues for both of those repos.
2020-09-16T12:20:41  <Justin_o> thanks for the camparison doc I'll double check the rules I've used against that.
