2019-11-25T16:49:05  <cindyli> clown: npm package for cockroachdb - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cockroachdb. i'm surprised that the last release was from a year ago.
2019-11-25T16:49:54  *** michelled <michelled!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-envekloqfsjkrqfy> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-11-25T16:50:27  <clown> thanks cindyli.  I *think* i get those installed as a side effect of installing Sequelize.  Let me check
2019-11-25T16:51:35  <cindyli> clown: ya, your way is what's suggested in the cockroachdb documentation - https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb-sequelize.html
2019-11-25T16:51:54  <cindyli> your way should be better
2019-11-25T16:52:47  <clown> well, I can't tell easisly.  I'm installing this:  https://github.com/cockroachdb/sequelize-cockroachdb
2019-11-25T16:53:24  <clown> or "easily" even
2019-11-25T16:54:13  <cindyli> this is the repo pointed in the cockroachdb documentation
2019-11-25T16:58:14  <clown> so is the one I'm installing:  https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb-sequelize.html

2019-11-25T20:36:21  <cindyli> hi sgithens, have you started to work on your snapshotter pull request to move the special handling for windows settings handlers such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/616/files#diff-ccff73df5921887c4a3f5dbbb5182496R170 into the gpii/windows repo?
2019-11-25T20:38:02  <sgithens> cindyli: A bit yes, I'm sort of in the middle of reworking things
2019-11-25T20:38:16  <sgithens> I'm hoping to have it ready for another review by the end of tuesday
2019-11-25T20:38:26  <cindyli> cool. thanks, sgithens
2019-11-25T20:38:32  <sgithens> thank you!  :)
2019-11-25T20:39:08  <sgithens> cindyli: I aquired a VM Ware license and got that set up before starting
2019-11-25T20:39:23  <sgithens> which blew about a day, but at least my machine isn't constantly crashing now
2019-11-25T20:39:45  <cindyli> what a great news!
2019-11-25T20:40:12  <sgithens> upgrading to Catalina seems to have fixed it for Justin_o , but I'm really not ready to make that jump yet after all the reports of wierd stuff
2019-11-25T20:40:53  <cindyli> ya, i'm holding off on the upgrade too ;)

2019-11-25T20:44:39  <Justin_o> sgithens: other than some initial incompatibilities everything has been fine for me on Catalina so far.
2019-11-25T20:44:51  <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2019-11-25T20:45:07  <Justin_o> They also support zsh now for the terminal so I've switched to that too
2019-11-25T20:54:00  <cindyli> i'll be spoiled by zsh's auto correction. would be harder to find typos ;)
2019-11-25T20:54:21  <Justin_o> haha
2019-11-25T20:59:12  <sgithens> cindyli: That would be sad, since you're very good at pointing out my grammar errors in jsdocs
