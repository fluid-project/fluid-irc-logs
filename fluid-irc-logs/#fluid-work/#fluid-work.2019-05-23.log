2019-05-23T15:58:09  <jhernandez> Bosmon: cindyli or any other more familiar with screen-reader-related issues - can you take a look at this JIRA and provide some comments if Gregg's proposed solution is not the optimal?
2019-05-23T15:58:10  <jhernandez> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3944
2019-05-23T16:08:12  <Bosmon> jhernandez - perhaps at least something from an icon font rather than an image per se
2019-05-23T16:08:35  <Bosmon> Someone at the IDRC such as alanharnum, gmoss may have an opinion also
2019-05-23T16:08:44  <jhernandez> yeah, I think that an image can be problematic when rescaling the qss
2019-05-23T16:08:49  <jhernandez> good point
2019-05-23T16:08:58  <jhernandez> :)

2019-05-23T16:17:23  <gmoss> Bosmon jhernandez: if they're using the × character, it would likely resolve as "times". Here's a table that shows which SR's will behave that way. I'm no expert, but personally I think the suggested fix of an image with alt text would be fine
2019-05-23T16:17:56  <gmoss> And more consistently styled across browsers (since fonts can change). An SVG may be the best option
2019-05-23T16:18:14  <gmoss> https://www.deque.com/blog/dont-screen-readers-read-whats-screen-part-1-punctuation-typographic-symbols/#math
2019-05-23T16:18:41  <gmoss> ^ Bosmon jhernandez: I forgot the link
2019-05-23T16:27:00  <jhernandez> gmoss: thanks for your advice - will copy/paste into the JIRA as a comment for others to see

2019-05-23T16:46:39  <colinclark> jhernandez: Is this an example of the sort of button we’re talking about? https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/renderer/aboutDialog/index.html#L29
2019-05-23T16:47:53  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2019-05-23T16:48:17  <colinclark> if so, the WCAG 2.1 working examples show the use of an aria-label attribute to address this, I think: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/working-examples/aria-label-invisible-label-box/#box
2019-05-23T16:51:39  <jhernandez> colinclark: good point
2019-05-23T16:52:02  <colinclark> I think that’s probably your best option given that this element already has an aria role associated with it
2019-05-23T16:52:36  <jhernandez> I think that Amarja is talking about other X button, the one that is supposed to close the QSS - not the about dialog (which is the one you sent to me in the link above)
2019-05-23T16:53:16  <jhernandez> but also, take into account that the process is being rendered by electron, and yeah, it's chrome somehow, but not sure if there's a difference
2019-05-23T16:54:44  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@205.211.168.101> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-05-23T16:55:08  <jhernandez> but yes, maybe we should ensure that all those X close buttons in gpii-app need to follow the same right approach
2019-05-23T16:55:24  <jhernandez> colinclark: do you mind commenting on the JIRA?
2019-05-23T16:55:32  <colinclark> sure
2019-05-23T16:55:51  <colinclark> do you know where the source to that close button is?
2019-05-23T16:55:51  <colinclark> jhernandez: ^
2019-05-23T16:55:59  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-05-23T16:56:12  <jhernandez> yes, I think so, let me find it
2019-05-23T16:58:54  <jhernandez> colinclark: src//renderer/qss/js/qssButtons.js

2019-05-23T17:05:24  <javjarfer[m]> wanted to ask you if there is something I could do in the short-term for this https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/772
2019-05-23T17:08:29  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, we should fix Mocks.js so that it doesn't silently fail over on an unknown action
2019-05-23T17:08:42  <Bosmon> But GPII-3652 is a higher priority, I think
2019-05-23T17:08:48  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf validation pull is still held up on that

2019-05-23T17:09:47  <jhernandez> colinclark: and yeah, that's the only thing I forgot sending
2019-05-23T17:09:53  <jhernandez> the X is defined in that settings file
2019-05-23T17:09:59  <jhernandez> sorry
2019-05-23T17:10:07  <colinclark> no problem
2019-05-23T17:10:10  <colinclark> Bosmon helped me find it
2019-05-23T17:10:41  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  Okay, do you think that fixing Mocks.js in that way will trigger more errors?
2019-05-23T17:11:02  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - it's possible, yes
2019-05-23T17:11:09  <Bosmon> That would be one of the aims of the activity : P
2019-05-23T17:11:18  <Bosmon> Until we do, we don't know how many other tests are passing "for no good reason"
2019-05-23T17:11:51  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay, I received priority for this ones today so, will be my first thing doing tomorrow
