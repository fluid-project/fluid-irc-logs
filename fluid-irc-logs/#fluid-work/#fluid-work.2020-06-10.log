2020-06-10T11:53:07  <Bosmon> jhernandez - other than your latest merge of GPII-4500, is there any remaining difference between your universal 1.3.5 branch and master?
2020-06-10T13:59:13  <jhernandez> Bosmon: nope, it's just that one

2020-06-10T14:24:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: I've updated your issue tracking spreadsheet for the Storytelling Tool repos
2020-06-10T14:24:38  <gmoss> let me know if you need any further detail :)
2020-06-10T14:26:24  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, I'll take a look
2020-06-10T14:49:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we're in the process of migrating the Infusion-Docs repo to 11ty. It might be a good idea to get as many of the Open PRs sorted out before the migration. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pulls

2020-06-10T15:43:05  <Justin_o> gtirloni: could you please review the Infusion-Docs PR related to infrastructure and see if they can be closed or if they need to be merged. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pulls
2020-06-10T15:52:37  <gtirloni> Justin_o: will do
2020-06-10T15:52:57  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-06-10T16:18:52  <colinclark> Justin_o: Can I ask you a dumb question?
2020-06-10T16:23:43  <Justin_o> colinclark: hello, sure
2020-06-10T16:23:55  <colinclark> I’m trying to best understand the fluid-publish idiom
2020-06-10T16:24:07  <colinclark> (though I’ve used it lots in the past, I want to understand the practice of it)
2020-06-10T16:24:23  <colinclark> so I currently have a library that I’ve split off a portion of into a new repository
2020-06-10T16:24:29  <colinclark> so now i have two libraries :)
2020-06-10T16:24:45  <colinclark> library B has some dependencies on library A
2020-06-10T16:25:04  <colinclark> so I did a little bit of refactoring of library A so that library B is happy
2020-06-10T16:25:46  <colinclark> separating library B from library A is API breaking, and I’d like to have library B fully working and a release of it before cutting a stable release of library A
2020-06-10T16:26:08  <colinclark> so i will publish a dev release of library A, get library B all sorted out, and then release both of them
2020-06-10T16:26:46  <colinclark> is the standard practice with fluid-publish to always set your version number in package.json to the n+1?
2020-06-10T16:27:05  <colinclark> so say my latest stable version of libary A is 2.0.0, and the next release is 3.0.0
2020-06-10T16:27:29  <colinclark> my package.json should declare 3.0.0, and then after i cut that stable release i bump it to 4.0.0, etc?
2020-06-10T16:27:56  <Justin_o> colinclark: basically yes, you need to manage the version number yourself, other than the pre-release portion. It basically just adds that on. So you'll want to make sure that in your package.json file before you run fluid-publish that you've bumped the version number to what ever the thing is a pre-release of
2020-06-10T16:28:07  <colinclark> ok, cool
2020-06-10T16:28:13  <colinclark> i told you it was a dumb question :)
2020-06-10T16:28:16  <colinclark> i just wanted to make sure
2020-06-10T16:28:44  <Justin_o> colinclark: no problem we actually had a couple missteps with publishing infusion dev releases because of that.
2020-06-10T16:29:17  <Justin_o> colinclark: I'm actually not sure it's an ideal workflow because you really don't necessarily know ahead of time what you really want the next version to be.
2020-06-10T16:30:29  <colinclark> yeah, exactly
2020-06-10T16:30:47  <Justin_o> colinclark: I believe I've mentioned to you in the past that it might be better to make use of fluid-publish only for sorting out the pre-release part of the version and to use np ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/np ) to do the rest. It will allow you to bump the version number during the publish step and you can choose which you want, major, minor, patch
2020-06-10T16:30:58  <colinclark> In my case here, I know Library A is going to have a whole bunch of API breaking changes coming over the next little while, so I guess it’s a bit more predictable
2020-06-10T16:31:05  <colinclark> oh yes
2020-06-10T16:31:10  <colinclark> interesting

2020-06-10T16:33:27  <Justin_o> colinclark: i'd have to see how hard it would be to pass the pre-release version number along to CI and have it all run as npm scripts defined in a projects package.json file.
