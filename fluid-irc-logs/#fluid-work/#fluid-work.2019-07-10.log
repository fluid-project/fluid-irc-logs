2019-07-10T12:17:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure if you saw my message in the channel yesterday. I saw you mention some stats on IE 11 adoption on a JIRA. I'm wondering what source you used for that, and also do we have any plans/options for cases where we may have to support legacy browsers for a specific project.

2019-07-10T13:28:48  <cindyli> jhernandez: i issued a pull request that includes a change to defaultSettings.json5 - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/801/files#diff-8c77fd0e3722740d22305a89c939bfacR9 - because your change you made in this pull request (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/800) may not be correct. I wonder if you could test defaultSettings.json5 in the pull request #801 using a windows computer or windows VM that has MS Word installed?
2019-07-10T13:33:52  <cindyli> Bosmon: i issued another pull request for GPII-3988: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/799. It adjusts the performProximityTriggered() to accept the "isEnvironmentalLogin" flag. The first pull request that has been merged for GPII-3988 only modified performLogin() and missed the proximity login. Can you review this second pull request when you have a chance?

2019-07-10T13:33:57  <cindyli> thanks, guys
2019-07-10T13:34:12  <Bosmon> cindyli - I saw the pull request and meant to ask you about it
2019-07-10T13:34:24  <cindyli> great.
2019-07-10T13:34:33  <Bosmon> I think, based on our conversations when the pull was first discussed, that this implementation is unnecessary
2019-07-10T13:34:47  <Bosmon> Since I think it is impossible that a login could both be "environmental" and "proximity triggered"
2019-07-10T13:35:21  <cindyli> the use case I thought about is: windows auto login -> user listener login -> windows auto login again
2019-07-10T13:37:06  <cindyli> also, i feel, if we have 2 login APIs, it's better to change both to accommodate this feature, even though the use case above is not in real use at the moment.
2019-07-10T13:37:44  <Bosmon> cindyli - I'm not sure I see how the use case works?
2019-07-10T13:38:01  <Bosmon> Also, I don't think it's a matter of the use case being "not in real use", I think it is probably inherently contradictory
2019-07-10T13:38:35  <Bosmon> And so my feeling is that at the moment we should not implement code paths that cater to scenarios that are not meaningful
2019-07-10T13:38:57  <cindyli> ok. if so we can close this pull request
2019-07-10T13:39:04  <Bosmon> Can you talk some more about your use case?
2019-07-10T13:39:14  <Bosmon> The one you described as "windows auto login -> user listener login -> windows auto login again"?
2019-07-10T13:39:37  <cindyli> in the case that NOVA computers can be used for both windows auto login and USB logins
2019-07-10T13:39:51  <Bosmon> cindyli - they may well be, yes
2019-07-10T13:39:59  <Bosmon> But only the windows auto logins will count as "environmental"
2019-07-10T13:40:48  <Bosmon> cindyli - but how would that relate to the implementation in your pull request?
2019-07-10T13:41:51  <cindyli> 1. a user logs into a NOVA computer: performLogin() is called to track this environmental login
2019-07-10T13:42:36  <Bosmon> cindyli - ah, ok I think I know where this is going
2019-07-10T13:42:37  <cindyli> 2. this person inserts a usb: performProximityTriggered() is called to logout 1 and login 2
2019-07-10T13:42:53  <cindyli> 3. this person logs out of windows
2019-07-10T13:44:10  <Bosmon> Actually no, I don't : P
2019-07-10T13:44:15  <cindyli> no, 3 should be: someone logs in the same computer using a different user id, performProximityTriggered() is called to logout 2 and login 3
2019-07-10T13:44:20  <Bosmon> Isn't the impl correct in this situation?
2019-07-10T13:45:43  <Bosmon> Throughout all of the scenario, the only value stored in lastEnvironmentalLoginGpiiKey is the correct one, the one which was received from the very first login
2019-07-10T13:46:03  <Bosmon> And I don't believe any of the subsequent steps disturb it
2019-07-10T13:46:19  <cindyli> shouldn't we track the last environmental login? in this case should be the user who logs in at step 3?
2019-07-10T13:46:40  <Bosmon> cindyli - but that step 3 is no environmental login
2019-07-10T13:46:51  <Bosmon> The only environmental one is the one at step 1
2019-07-10T13:47:01  <cindyli> that person at the step 3 also triggers the windows auto login
2019-07-10T13:47:31  <Bosmon> cindyli - but you corrected your step 3
2019-07-10T13:47:34  <cindyli> my concern is, whenever an environmental login is triggered via performProximityTriggered(), it will not be tracked
2019-07-10T13:47:46  <Bosmon> cindyli - but it can never be triggered that way
2019-07-10T13:48:02  <Bosmon> cindyli - or did you still mean in your step 3 that someone logged out of Windows?
2019-07-10T13:48:21  <Bosmon> If they log out of Windows, they trash the entire local FlowManager, which gets a fresh environmental login in the next session
2019-07-10T13:49:01  <cindyli> nah, step 3 would be someone uses the windows feature like "switch to another user" to login the windows
2019-07-10T13:49:14  <cindyli> will this trash the entire local FlowManager too?
2019-07-10T13:49:40  <Bosmon> cindyli - when stegru implements this, he will indeed schedule the Windows service to allocate a fresh FlowManager instance
2019-07-10T13:49:54  <cindyli> ok. cool

2019-07-10T13:51:23  <jhernandez> cindyli: sorry, reading this now
2019-07-10T13:51:25  <cindyli> however, Bosmon, with a fresh flow manager, the windows auto login could also happen by calling performProximityTriggered()
2019-07-10T13:51:41  <Bosmon> cindyli - but how!!
2019-07-10T13:51:43  <cindyli> jhernandez: please look at my very first message for you
2019-07-10T13:51:57  <jhernandez> yes, I realized about that thing earlier in the morning
2019-07-10T13:51:58  <Bosmon> cindyli - the windows auto login is only ever triggered by stegru 's windows service code
2019-07-10T13:52:04  <Bosmon> And it will never call that method

2019-07-10T13:52:14  <jhernandez> and yeah, your fix is the good one
2019-07-10T13:53:02  <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez, it would be safer if we can test it with a MS Word. i don't have such windows VM
2019-07-10T13:53:07  <stegru> switch to another user would just mean each user has their own instance of gpii

2019-07-10T13:53:29  <cindyli> Bosmon: who knows. have a look at stegru's pull request - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/798/files#diff-badd143eac3a550d1192d59693baf03aR160
2019-07-10T13:54:05  <cindyli> stegru: looking at your code, it depends on the flag of "proximity"
2019-07-10T13:54:27  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I guess in theory it is possible
2019-07-10T13:54:36  <jhernandez> cindyli: yes, will do
2019-07-10T13:54:41  <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez
2019-07-10T13:54:45  <Bosmon> But to deploy a listener with proximity: true and environmental: true would be senseless
2019-07-10T13:54:46  <jhernandez> thanks to you!
2019-07-10T13:54:49  <stegru> that flag is set for the NFC proximity device
2019-07-10T13:54:59  <stegru> yes, Bosmon
2019-07-10T13:55:35  <cindyli> well, as said, calling performProximityTriggered() and performLogin() has the same result
2019-07-10T13:55:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - what do you mean "has the same result"?
2019-07-10T13:55:57  <cindyli> for the first windows login
2019-07-10T13:56:43  <cindyli> anyway, if we don't change performProximityTriggered(), we need to keep in mind that only performLogin() can track environmental logins
2019-07-10T13:56:55  <cindyli> if your guys have no problem with it, I'm totally fine
2019-07-10T13:57:38  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think it is fine - I don't think we will need to "keep it in mind" since currently the alternative is inconceivable
2019-07-10T13:58:01  <Bosmon> "proximity" logins can only be those which are mediated by a physical token which can be brought to and from the local device
2019-07-10T13:58:19  <Bosmon> "environmental" logins are logins resulting from an inherent property of the local device itself which can never be taken away from it
2019-07-10T13:58:32  <Bosmon> I can't see a reasonable way in which the two kinds could coincide
2019-07-10T13:58:35  <cindyli> ok. great. let's close this pull request
2019-07-10T13:59:12  <stegru> cindyli, we could add a check "(!proximity || !environmental)" if it would help you sleep better
2019-07-10T14:00:20  <stegru> or
2019-07-10T14:00:39  <stegru> if (proximity && environmental) { fluid.fail("cindy told us so"); }
2019-07-10T14:00:47  <cindyli> haha
2019-07-10T14:01:24  <stegru> or perhaps check for isEnvironmental in proximityTriggered?
2019-07-10T14:02:18  <stegru> it would be fun to make a proximity auto-login listener, however
2019-07-10T14:02:23  <cindyli> honestly, i would prefer to have these checks to stop the error earlier.
2019-07-10T14:02:53  <cindyli> but it should be ok without them if the workflow that Bosmon described does get followed
2019-07-10T14:04:04  <stegru> but then the checks would be in the same place that the bug is.. if I couldn't resist making a rogue listener, then nothing can stop me
2019-07-10T14:13:16  <stegru> cindyli, i've updated the PR: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/798/commits/93fbf86c800b725b0778b4bab64bdc3fedd5ef5e

2019-07-10T14:46:39  <jhernandez> yes, yanachkov__, let's say that you have more settings for word to be included in the reset to std profile
2019-07-10T14:47:12  <yanachkov__> this changes the things

2019-07-10T14:47:36  <jhernandez> it's more readable
2019-07-10T14:47:44  <yanachkov__> This new form will be for the this build?
2019-07-10T14:47:45  <jhernandez> but yeah, I guess it changes things on the gpii-app side

2019-07-10T18:31:52  <gmoss> ping Justin_o
2019-07-10T18:32:56  <Justin_o> gmoss: hello
2019-07-10T18:33:16  <gmoss> Justin_o: i'm ready to pair up on the community meeting stuff in about 5 mins
2019-07-10T18:34:32  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay sounds good
2019-07-10T18:37:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: ready!
2019-07-10T18:38:37  <Justin_o> yep
2019-07-10T18:47:26  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: I'm putting together a new refreshed capture tool build, and lost track of where you were with the most up to date filled in version of teh solutions registry with schema's.  Did that go in to master along with the work (the might be reverted) or is it still in a branch somewhere?
2019-07-10T18:47:58  <the-t-in-rtf> you were at the meeting, right?
2019-07-10T18:48:03  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway.
2019-07-10T18:48:15  <the-t-in-rtf> the question is not, is it in master yet, but will it be in master tomorrow?
2019-07-10T18:48:27  <the-t-in-rtf> the schemas are part of the validation pull.
2019-07-10T18:48:42  <the-t-in-rtf> it's in master right now, but will likely be moved off to the side.
2019-07-10T18:49:12  <the-t-in-rtf> probably you and @Bosmon and I should just agree on how the schema work is to be parked, perhaps in a branch that you can pull from.
2019-07-10T18:49:26  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: right, well, I never know ifthere are bunch of updates that you and JJ have been working on to add even more stuff
2019-07-10T18:49:38  <the-t-in-rtf> but if you were to pin to a recent dev release and stay there, you'd probably be safe until we sort things out
2019-07-10T18:49:53  <sgithens> I'll just stick with today's version of universal master, which is what is merged in to my branch anyways
2019-07-10T18:49:53  <the-t-in-rtf> JJ has been working to add new stuff, and perhaps stegru
2019-07-10T18:50:03  <sgithens> I won't merge and updates in to it for a while
2019-07-10T18:50:18  <the-t-in-rtf> Yeah, probably Dr. Boz is the man to check with before you move forwards.
2019-07-10T18:50:56  <the-t-in-rtf> No idea which of the recent onboarding efforts is in master, but I saw a few in recent closed pulls.
2019-07-10T18:51:17  <the-t-in-rtf> you may just have to put a pin in it and let people know that you won't be able to support everything we support until we get through the traffic jam.
2019-07-10T18:51:50  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Yeah.. I'm just not going to merge any more updates
2019-07-10T18:51:58  <sgithens> it's all in my current GPII-228 branch
2019-07-10T18:52:07  <sgithens> I merged it up to master yesterday
