2020-07-03T15:41:54  <Uttara> Cindyli: Do you have time for a quick meet? I was able to address some of the questions from yesterday
2020-07-03T15:42:47  <cindyli> sure, Uttara. we count room?
2020-07-03T15:42:52  <Uttara> yes
2020-07-03T15:42:55  <Uttara> will be right there
2020-07-03T15:43:52  <gmoss> cindyli: I'd like to begin executing the "SHIP IT" part of the plan :) Should I file PR's for each branch, or is there any action required on my part at all in order to get master pushed out?
2020-07-03T15:48:15  <gmoss> oh yeah, gtirloni I meant to ask, we used to have a db backup job that we would run before deploying to production branches. the build process should be idempotent, but we did it just in case. is there any sort of backup job being run on the docker volumes?
2020-07-03T15:49:09  <gtirloni> gmoss: yeah, we have daily backups
2020-07-03T15:49:13  <gmoss> awesome :)
2020-07-03T15:50:47  <cindyli> gmoss: i will push master into each production branch. no action required on your part for that.
2020-07-03T15:50:57  <gmoss> cindyli: okay great. thank you!
2020-07-03T15:51:27  <cindyli> gmoss, gtirloni: are daily backups good enough for this deploy? or do we need an extra backup before I push?
2020-07-03T15:52:24  <cindyli> gtirloni: just saw your email. sorry to hear it. hope you will feel better soon
2020-07-03T15:52:27  <gmoss> cindyli: there haven't been any new stories added anywhere in a couple months, so I think if there's a backup file available from the last 24 hours, that should be good enough
2020-07-03T15:52:52  <cindyli> great. pushing nowâ€¦
2020-07-03T15:53:00  * gmoss holds breath
2020-07-03T15:53:29  <gtirloni> of anything breaks, I'm still here ðŸ¤ž
2020-07-03T16:00:10  <cindyli> all pushed
2020-07-03T16:01:20  <gmoss> cindyli: awesome! I'll test them all out
2020-07-03T16:02:17  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
2020-07-03T16:16:08  <gmoss> cindyli: it looks like the Karisma site is broken, I'm investigating https://karisma-stories.floeproject.org/
2020-07-03T16:16:08  <gmoss> my initial hunch is it's an environment difference, since it's running fine when I host the server locally. I'll let you know if I find anything
2020-07-03T16:16:25  <gmoss> all other sites are working fine
2020-07-03T16:19:20  <gmoss> cindyli: looks like there was a build error https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/runs/834953268#step:3:41
2020-07-03T16:27:14  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss. the build script for karisma looks good tho
2020-07-03T16:30:02  <gmoss> Indeed. it's a little puzzling. shall we check-in?
2020-07-03T16:30:30  <cindyli> sure, gmoss
2020-07-03T16:30:49  <cindyli> i'm in stansup
2020-07-03T16:57:26  <gmoss> cindyli: just to be sure, I did a file-by-file comparison (automated, of course) for the entire Karisma branch vs the AIHEC branch, and they're identical
2020-07-03T16:59:33  <gmoss> cindyli: are you able to re-run the deploy action?  I don't have permissions. maybe that'll fix it?
2020-07-03T17:06:47  <cindyli> gmoss: just re-ran, same error - https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/runs/835119932
2020-07-03T17:07:06  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks. well, at least it's consistent :)
2020-07-03T17:07:20  <cindyli> :)
2020-07-03T17:51:07  <gtirloni> back
2020-07-03T17:51:27  <gtirloni> cindyli gmoss: want me to check it?
2020-07-03T17:51:46  <cindyli> that would be great, gtirloni
2020-07-03T17:52:02  <gtirloni> ok
2020-07-03T17:52:21  <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni. no rush
2020-07-03T17:59:12  <gmoss> gtirloni: thank you! Hope you're feeling better
2020-07-03T18:05:14  <gtirloni> gmoss: thanks, still got a headache but it's bearable now :)
2020-07-03T18:05:17  <gtirloni> cindyli gmoss: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/runs/835237764
2020-07-03T18:05:23  <gtirloni> two problems:
2020-07-03T18:05:53  <gtirloni> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ljCreBAI/first%20problem%2C%20it%20was%20pointing%20to%20alan's%20repo%20where%20I%20think%20karisma%20existed%20exclusively%20before
2020-07-03T18:06:23  <gtirloni> second problem was lack of a config file.. I created one using an example and set it to the karisma theme. please let me know if it looks okay
2020-07-03T18:06:37  <gtirloni> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bc4oUyra/
2020-07-03T18:09:23  <cindyli> gtirloni: "themeIndexFile" for karisma should be "karismaWelcome.html"
2020-07-03T18:09:34  <gmoss> gtirloni: that's surprising! I thought we'd "moved" the job off of alan's repo, but I'm glad it's an easy fix. The config file looks good, except `themeIndexFile` should be `karismaWelcome.html`
2020-07-03T18:09:41  <gmoss> whoops cindyli beat me to it ;)
2020-07-03T18:10:17  <cindyli> gmoss: should the authoring be enabled for karisma site?
2020-07-03T18:10:27  <gmoss> cindyli: oh, sorry good catch. no it should not
2020-07-03T18:10:30  <gmoss> gtirloni ^
2020-07-03T18:10:47  <cindyli> gtirloni: the last line in the config file: "authoringEnabled": false
2020-07-03T18:10:47  <gmoss> only AIHEC should have authoringEnabled set to true
2020-07-03T18:10:54  <gmoss> and staging site
2020-07-03T18:10:54  <cindyli> ok
2020-07-03T18:16:04  <gtirloni> ok changed and redeployed
2020-07-03T18:16:52  <gmoss> gtirloni: awesome! Thanks very much :) it all looks good
2020-07-03T18:17:41  <gtirloni> great! :)
2020-07-03T20:14:15  <colinclark> howâ€™s your awesome new fixie, philip?
2020-07-03T20:14:52  <philip> It's parked for the moment, as getting a helmet is currently tricky
2020-07-03T20:16:15  <colinclark> oh shoot, how come?
2020-07-03T20:17:18  <philip> Our local bike shop is taking some pretty serious precautions: they can't really sanitize their products so you can't touch anything before buying it
2020-07-03T20:21:05  <philip> so I'm not sure I want to roll the dice and maybe buy a helmet that doesn't fit my noggin
2020-07-03T20:23:37  <gtirloni> fixie uh
2020-07-03T20:23:48  * gtirloni laughs in 12 speeds
2020-07-03T20:23:52  <gtirloni> :)
2020-07-03T20:28:50  <philip> Look, the person who sold it to me was extremely convincing
2020-07-03T20:32:58  <philip> and I got a good enough deal that I'm willing to be made a little fun of
2020-07-03T20:43:01  <colinclark> hahaha
2020-07-03T20:43:03  <colinclark> I have a single speed bike
2020-07-03T20:43:05  <colinclark> I love it
2020-07-03T20:43:19  <colinclark> gtirloniâ€™s just jealous
2020-07-03T20:43:41  <colinclark> Also, would anyone like to buy a single speed bike?
2020-07-03T20:50:51  <gtirloni> LOL
2020-07-03T20:51:03  <gtirloni> jk ;)
2020-07-03T21:02:44  <colinclark> :)
2020-07-03T21:02:53  <colinclark> Seriously
2020-07-03T21:02:56  <colinclark> The hills are too much
2020-07-03T21:03:00  <colinclark> I need a bike with gears
2020-07-03T21:21:46  <gtirloni> I had one with 27 gears and I switched to 12 gears this week (no gear on the front, just the back). Much easier to switch gears and stuff. Also less maintenance. I recommend
2020-07-03T21:39:20  <colinclark> thatâ€™s exactly the kind of bike i want, gtirloni
