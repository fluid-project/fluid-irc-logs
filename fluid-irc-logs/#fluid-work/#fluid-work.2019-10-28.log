2019-10-28T16:13:32  <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: do you ever have issues running "vagrant up". I'm finding with my new machine it crashes a lot, but my older machine is fine
2019-10-28T16:16:53  <clown> yes, Justin_o.  Not a lot, but sometimes.
2019-10-28T16:17:09  <clown> The fan go very loud briefly and then a complete shutdown.
2019-10-28T16:17:42  <clown> I've told Bert about it.  He said that Iris has a similar problem, but in her case it's not starting a VM
2019-10-28T16:17:59  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@12.226.198.2> has quit IRC (Quit: colinclark)
2019-10-28T16:18:32  <clown> I've found that if I run "vagrant up" just after logging in, it's less likely to happen.  That is, the more apps running, the more likely it is to happen.
2019-10-28T16:19:15  <Justin_o> clown: thanks.. I wonder if it's related to the number of apps, or maybe which ones are running or what they are doing.
2019-10-28T16:20:00  <clown> Justin_o:  I've wondered if it's the version of VirtualBox.  I'm running 5.2.16 r123759
2019-10-28T16:20:15  <clown> Are you running more recent version?
2019-10-28T16:21:11  <Justin_o> I have the latest VirtualBox (v6.0.14 r133895 (Qt5.6.3))and Vagrant (v2.2.6) running.
2019-10-28T16:21:28  <Justin_o> it looks like my vm is running again now
2019-10-28T16:21:44  <Justin_o> well it's in the process of booting anyways
2019-10-28T16:22:13  <clown> okay, so it's not the version of VituralBox and Vagrant (I'm running Vagrant 2.1.2
2019-10-28T16:22:32  <cindyli> i'm running the same version as clown and has been lucky without having this issue. sgithens has this problem too
2019-10-28T16:22:54  <cindyli> i have vagrant 2.0.2
2019-10-28T16:23:15  <Justin_o> cindyli: interesting.. makes me want to do a clean install and restore from your machine ;)
2019-10-28T16:23:56  <Justin_o> by the way, if you upgrade to macOS Catalina, you'll need to update to the latest Virtual Box, but on my newer machine, I'm still on Mojave
2019-10-28T16:26:00  <cindyli> Justin_o: does the latest Virtual Box with macOS Catalina work better?
2019-10-28T16:26:08  <cindyli> with less crashes?
2019-10-28T16:27:17  <Justin_o> cindyli: I don't think VirtualBox really works on macOS Catalina without the latest version.
2019-10-28T16:27:46  <Justin_o> but after updating it worked fine, but on that machine VirtualBox had been working fine in Mojave, so not sure it would solve this current issue or not
2019-10-28T16:28:43  <cindyli> i see
2019-10-28T16:30:46  <clown> Justin_o, cindyli I'm still using Mojave
2019-10-28T16:33:43  <cindyli> here are some discussions online about the crash issue. some ppl have the problem that Virtualbox VM crashes MacOS causing the computer to restart. seems it could be worse. ;)
2019-10-28T16:33:51  <cindyli> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/361418/why-does-virtualbox-crash-macos
2019-10-28T16:34:06  <cindyli> this thread says: This is commonly due to bugs in VirtualBox.
2019-10-28T16:34:07  <cindyli> VirtualBox installs itself as a kernel extension directly into the lowest level of kernel software running on your Mac affecting stability of the system as a whole.
2019-10-28T16:36:35  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for sharing, so potentially it's just a fact of using VirtualBox? Or maybe a problem when it first installed?
2019-10-28T16:37:28  <cindyli> very possible

2019-10-28T19:28:38  <Bosmon> sgithens, Justin_o - at least I find one of Windows 7's virtues is that it is a perfectly stable host VM for Windows 10 vagrant : P
2019-10-28T19:29:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o, it is imponderable whether we might have a 3.0 release this year although I think it is still possible
2019-10-28T19:29:17  <Bosmon> We have now tackled one of the BIG THREE, which were, SJRK, UIO+, and gpii-app
2019-10-28T19:29:23  <Bosmon> I think I am getting reasonably close on gpii-app
2019-10-28T19:29:39  <Bosmon> But I haven't checked in with gmoss in a while as to how much of a train wreck FLUID-6148 has left SJRK in
2019-10-28T19:30:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that's a good question about SJRK. I'm not sure where that is at. I think gross had to do other fixes/changes and probably hasn't had time to explore FLUID-6148 there for a while
2019-10-28T19:31:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, I've started to work on FLUID-6400
2019-10-28T19:32:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's great
2019-10-28T19:32:48  <Justin_o> the change to multipleOf from divisibleBy was easy
2019-10-28T19:33:27  <Justin_o> I'm changing things up to source the stringArrayIndex from the schema. That actually works pretty well and I'm just fixing up the tests now.
2019-10-28T19:33:53  <Justin_o> I think we might want to schedule a meeting to talk about next steps soon
2019-10-28T19:37:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-10-28T19:39:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's awesome, let's loop the-t-in-rtf in too
2019-10-28T19:40:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: when would you be free fro another discussion about the prefs framework refactoring.
2019-10-28T19:41:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, do you think we should do https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6360 as part of this work. Either the refactoring work as a whole, or the FLUID-6400 specifically
2019-10-28T19:41:46  <Justin_o> I guess maybe separate from FLUID-6400 but maybe shortly after
