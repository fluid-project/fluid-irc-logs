2019-07-29T14:37:38  <Justin_o> colinclark: do you know if the person you recommended for the community meeting this week is able to make it?
2019-07-29T14:37:50  <colinclark> Luke Church, you mean?
2019-07-29T14:44:58  <colinclark> If so, yes. He texted this weekend and said he was free on Wednesday, and would be happy to talk about his work with Africa’s Voices.
2019-07-29T14:45:15  <colinclark> He was curious to know more about the audience, so I just sent him an email and cc’ed you, Justin_o.
2019-07-29T14:45:18  <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, yes I believe that's who I meant
2019-07-29T14:45:25  <Justin_o> thanks
2019-07-29T14:46:08  <colinclark> I have a feeling people might also be quite interested in his work designing programming languages, and his experience working on the Dart team at Google
2019-07-29T14:46:11  <colinclark> and so on :)

2019-07-29T14:46:53  <Justin_o> yes, probably.. I want to send out a meeting notice.. not sure exactly what to put in that.. I guess I can send a follow up e-mail in the thread you started
2019-07-29T14:47:45  <colinclark> Or we could just say something like
2019-07-29T14:50:12  <colinclark> “Luke Church (http://lukechurchnet.appspot.com/) will speak to us about his recent work on big data and AI for with Africa’s Voices Foundation (https://www.africasvoices.org/) and his research as a human-centric programming language designer.”
2019-07-29T14:51:25  <Justin_o> Sounds good.. for topic title does "Big Data and AI for Africa's Voices Foundation" sound okay?
2019-07-29T14:51:38  <colinclark> sure
2019-07-29T14:52:24  <colinclark> I’m sure he’ll find both terms—big data and AI—suitably contentious :)
2019-07-29T14:53:55  <Justin_o> that should make things more interesting :)
2019-07-29T14:54:01  <Justin_o> maybe I should put them in quotes :)
2019-07-29T14:54:07  <colinclark> :)
2019-07-29T14:54:27  <colinclark> I have resolved to always put quotes around both “artificial” and “intelligence” when I use them
2019-07-29T14:54:52  <colinclark> since i think that when we talk about this sort of a thing, we’re talking about something which is neither artificial nor intelligence
2019-07-29T14:55:06  <colinclark> but of course all that quoting can get pretty tedious

2019-07-29T17:47:31  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2019-07-29T17:55:00  <Justin_o> alanharnum: I merged https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/956
2019-07-29T17:55:36  <alanharnum> thanks Justin_o - I think we can close https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6361 as part of this, right?
2019-07-29T17:55:59  <Justin_o> yes, we can close that one too.. did you want to do that or would you like me to?
2019-07-29T17:56:08  <alanharnum> Justin_o: nope, doing it now
2019-07-29T17:56:13  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks :)
2019-07-29T17:56:59  <Justin_o> alanharnum: have you heard anything about when the chromium version of MS Edge will be officially released
2019-07-29T17:58:29  <alanharnum> Justin_o: "Fall 2019" is the language right now for wide release - it's been available in  beta since April
2019-07-29T17:59:30  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks.. I've been investigating https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6385
2019-07-29T17:59:40  <Justin_o> where the all-tests stall in MS Edge
2019-07-29T18:00:46  <Justin_o> you can see the details in the comments, but it looks like it's related to the "selectionchange" event not firing correctly when in an iframe. However, it works in the Dev Channel version of Edge.
2019-07-29T18:02:33  <alanharnum> Yeah, I'd assume that issue will a) Not be fixed in the EdgeHTML version and b) Will go away when the Chromium-based Edge is widely released.
2019-07-29T18:02:47  <alanharnum> Today is in fact Edge's fourth birthday (for public release).
2019-07-29T18:03:54  <Justin_o> wow really
2019-07-29T18:04:03  <Justin_o> too bad they didn't coincide the update with the birthday
2019-07-29T18:05:17  <Justin_o> jhung: which repo did you say you've updated to address the docpad generation issue?
2019-07-29T18:06:33  <jhung> Justin_o let me check...
2019-07-29T18:06:45  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2019-07-29T18:13:10  <jhung> Justin_o the changes I haven't merged into master on docs-inclusive-learning. If I create a PR, can you test it with the work you're doing and merge if it works for you?
2019-07-29T18:15:13  <Justin_o> jhung: I'm not really doing any work at the moment, but wanted to update the related JIRA
2019-07-29T18:15:29  <Justin_o> if your work is ready to be reviewed though, I can do that.
