2019-12-02T13:30:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have to run out soon, but just wanted to ask while I can. Do arrays merge? I thought they always replaced, but it looks like the they are just being merged based on the position.
2019-12-02T13:32:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - they don't merge
2019-12-02T13:32:47  <Bosmon> Although if you want anything useful to happen to them you will have to write a mergePolicy
2019-12-02T13:34:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so they should be replacing?
2019-12-02T13:35:21  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I guess that's what you want to happen to them?
2019-12-02T13:36:05  <Justin_o> so something strange must be happening in my code then because I have a default like this [a, b, c, d] and then when initializing I supply [f, g] to replace the original and I'm getting [f, g, c, d]
2019-12-02T13:36:12  <Justin_o> is that what's supposed to happen?
2019-12-02T13:36:36  <Justin_o> I guess I just need to understand what is expected to happen, and that will inform how I arrange things.

2019-12-02T14:24:58  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, @Bosmon can comment better, but what you saw is exactly why I am largely transitioning away from arrays in favour of maps.
2019-12-02T14:25:23  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. merging [0,1,2] with [3] ends up with [3,1,2]
2019-12-02T14:26:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well what is meant to happen is what you want to happen :)
2019-12-02T14:26:07  <the-t-in-rtf> you still have the problem of removing material with maps, but the merging is a lot clearer
2019-12-02T14:26:14  <Bosmon> I'm not sure that what you reported was what you wanted?

2019-12-02T15:33:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, there you are, @clown.
2019-12-02T15:34:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to check with you briefly on QA work in staging.
2019-12-02T15:34:46  <the-t-in-rtf> It sounded from earlier chats like you had a better idea of how to exercise the cloud flowmanager and prefs server from the client install.
2019-12-02T15:35:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I'd like to write that up for Kavya shortly.
2019-12-02T15:35:49  <clown> Hi the-t-in-rtf.  *reading log, and connecting to slack*
2019-12-02T15:36:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: just got back. I was expecting the whole array to be replaced
2019-12-02T15:36:15  <clown> Well, actually I don't.
2019-12-02T15:36:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, sounds like a mergePolicy: "replace" is what you want
2019-12-02T15:37:11  <clown> I asked stepan if there was a way for me to run the tests in the flowmanager container (unit and integration tests), the-t-in-rtf
2019-12-02T15:37:18  <clown> He said no.
2019-12-02T15:37:41  <the-t-in-rtf> So was I correct in my assumption that you can't exercise those endpoints using anything in the app at the moment?
2019-12-02T15:37:42  <clown> I then asked if they are run simply at deployment.  Again, no, only the rake tests
2019-12-02T15:38:17  <clown> I then said, I guess Kavya will find whether the changes to the ContextManager will have negative effect, but...
2019-12-02T15:39:00  <clown> there I am assuming she checks the QSS to see if preferences there are realized in the UI.
2019-12-02T15:39:01  <the-t-in-rtf> Same question about the context manager, could the client ever have communicated with it?
2019-12-02T15:39:24  <clown> My understanding is that the PSPChannel is invovled, and that's the locus of the changes to the CM.
2019-12-02T15:40:15  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, it would be good to narrow it down to buttons, menus, etc that she could try.
2019-12-02T15:40:16  <clown> Put another way.  The removal of the CM was done, but the communication to changes settings via the PSPChannel was adjusted to as to work without the CM.
2019-12-02T15:40:45  <the-t-in-rtf> in my testing I turned off the VM's networking altogether and couldn't find any buttons that complained
2019-12-02T15:41:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, yes, i might just add the replace merge policy. I wasn't sure if I had messed something up with all my tinkering though.
2019-12-02T15:41:06  <clown> cindyli, do you know the relationship between the QSS and the PSPChannel?
2019-12-02T15:41:18  <the-t-in-rtf> so I guess I'm asking, if the cloud falls in the forest, does anything on the client side currently hear it?
2019-12-02T15:41:24  <Justin_o> but I'm also not sure if I really want to deviate from how other options are merged, but we don't deal too much with arrays so it's probably okay I guess.
2019-12-02T15:41:37  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, good idea, @cindyli would also probably have a good idea.
2019-12-02T15:42:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess these merge policies are another one of those pieces that is a bit opaque in the framework at the moment.
2019-12-02T15:43:23  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, we are only going to have more of them, rather than less : P
2019-12-02T15:43:31  <Bosmon> Although hopefully ones which are a bit mroe logically arranged
2019-12-02T15:43:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay :)
2019-12-02T15:43:54  <Bosmon> The current mergePolicies are a bit of a blunt instrument
2019-12-02T15:43:56  <cindyli> clown: QSS uses the PSPChannel web socket provided by the universal to talk to the local flow manager
2019-12-02T15:44:06  *** jhung <jhung!~jhung@72.143.28.202> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2019-12-02T15:44:46  <clown> okay, cindyli, does that have anything to do with the work I did on removing the CM, but keeping the PSPChannel "intact"?
2019-12-02T15:45:20  <clown> Or, more specifically, what can kavya tests on the QSS that will show that "everything still works" without a CM?
2019-12-02T15:45:53  <clown> *what can kavya TEST
2019-12-02T15:47:11  <cindyli> clown: kavya can test her regular QSS test cases to make sure everything works fine as usual
2019-12-02T15:48:10  <clown> that's what I thought.  the-t-in-rtf, is wanting to specify which buttons/menus in QSS to look into.  Perhaps kavya already has that in her test protocol.
2019-12-02T15:48:23  <clown> She is not in this room.  *checking slack*
2019-12-02T15:48:44  <clown> she is not there either.
2019-12-02T15:53:02  *** christop_ <christop_!~textual@24.54.251.55> has quit IRC (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2019-12-02T15:53:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so I'm trying to solve that problem for FLUID-6420. I think I have an idea that's similar to the approach you mentioned on Friday but would rely on an expander instead of merge policies
2019-12-02T15:53:50  <Justin_o> I'll keep the preferences array for supplying the preferences directly. I'll probably add the "replace" merge policy to that.
2019-12-02T15:54:07  <cindyli> clown: your change to PSPChannel is at updating context - https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/d141625cad9e8809482e0b68b152f6b04a1ad60c#diff-e28b72dafa8f53a9b7285f6ed50f7449L161, so a specific test Kavya should perform is to switch to a different preferences set. I'm not sure if she still has that test case tho
2019-12-02T15:55:12  <clown> cindyli, by "switch to a different preferences set", I imagine there is something in QSS that allows the user to choose between "bright" vs. "noisyandbright", etc.
2019-12-02T15:55:25  <cindyli> yes
2019-12-02T15:55:26  <clown> Or whatever prefs sets are available to that particular use.
2019-12-02T15:55:33  <cindyli> ya
2019-12-02T15:55:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: Next I'll have an option called contextAwarePrefs that takes an object. This intended to be the locate that contextAware preferences are supplied as an object, in the expanded form. (preference.name: {priority: "after:someOtherPref})
2019-12-02T15:56:12  <clown> it's been a long time since I looked at an actual QSS.  So, what that something is that allows the switch is beyond me.
2019-12-02T15:56:40  <cindyli> clown: I think the PCP UI (not 100% sure if it was called PCP) had a dropdown menu for this switch. it's not part of QSS. so I don't know if kavya still can test it
2019-12-02T15:57:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: Next I'll have the expander on prefsPrioritized that take in the preference and contextAwarePrefs as arguments and will convert the array to an object and merge the contextAwarePrefs ontop unless the value was null at which point it will remove it.
2019-12-02T15:57:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the prefsPrioritized is what is fed into the other parts for sourcing the schemas. How does that sound?
2019-12-02T15:57:57  <clown> ah, good not know, cindyli.  Thanks.  I'll try to keep an eye open for kavya and ask her when I see her, here, on in slack/ops
2019-12-02T15:58:12  <cindyli> thanks, clown
2019-12-02T15:58:39  <javjarfer[m]>  hi the-t-in-rtf ! Good afternoon
2019-12-02T15:59:21  <clown> "good not know"????  I meant "good to know".  I hate this keyboard.

2019-12-02T18:44:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the idea I had mentioned above didn't work. I believe it's because I'm passing in the IoC Reference  for the contaxtAwareness supplied option and it is being resolved before the context awareness is run.

2019-12-02T19:48:15  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I wasn't quite sure what the idea was : P
2019-12-02T19:48:24  <Bosmon> I still think the mergePolicy will be the clearest option : P
2019-12-02T19:48:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm trying to do the mergePolicy one now, but am not having much success
2019-12-02T19:48:47  <Justin_o> but it could be related to my setup
2019-12-02T19:49:23  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you could copy the mergePolicy code into your own named copy, just so you can trace through how it is acting
2019-12-02T19:49:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's my merge policy
2019-12-02T19:49:55  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/BB7Y4pyc/
2019-12-02T19:50:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the prefsPrioritized option

2019-12-02T19:54:00  <Bosmon2> [19:52] <Bosmon> And so your job will then be to expand all the elements by hand

2019-12-02T19:54:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the result of which is to have something like expander: [funcName: "fluid.prefs.builder.prioritizePrefs", args: ["{that}.options.preferences"]]

2019-12-02T19:56:04  <Justin_o> here's my test expander
2019-12-02T19:56:29  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/GEsgl4xL/
2019-12-02T19:56:59  <Justin_o> also the options provided through context awareness doesn't show up in the prioritizedPrefs, only the original expander is there.

2019-12-02T20:07:24  <Bosmon2> Justin_o - what you've written is pretty strange
2019-12-02T20:07:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon2: okay, that could explain why it doesn't work :)
2019-12-02T20:07:43  <Bosmon2> The contents of prioritizedPrefs will be an array, not prioritizedPrefs.expander
2019-12-02T20:07:47  *** Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2019-12-02T20:08:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that was me testing things out, because I'm actually not getting an array back. the array is actually being added to the expander property
2019-12-02T20:08:33  <Justin_o> I also found this strange
2019-12-02T20:08:45  <Bosmon> Justin_o - also it seems the arguments to fluid.expandImmediate are the wrong way round
2019-12-02T20:09:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I thought that might be the case, but tried this because on Friday you had mentioned "fluid.expandImmediate(that, <stuff>)"
2019-12-02T20:09:27  <Justin_o> http://irc-logs.fluidproject.org/%23fluid-work/%23fluid-work.2019-11-29.log
2019-12-02T20:09:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, I have had a cold recently : P
2019-12-02T20:09:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2019-12-02T20:10:00  <Bosmon> Getting an array inside prioritizedPrefs.expander is very badly wrong
2019-12-02T20:10:04  <Justin_o> neither was working for me anyways, but I think it's because of the array being applied to the expander property instead of to the prefsPrioritized itself
2019-12-02T20:10:05  <Bosmon> I can't think of anything that would achieve that
2019-12-02T20:11:35  <Justin_o> Bosmon: is it a bug with the expander?
2019-12-02T20:11:50  <Bosmon> Justin_o - seems impossible
2019-12-02T20:11:55  <Bosmon> Can you check it in and I will lok
2019-12-02T20:12:01  <Bosmon> Sadly probably not before Wednesday
2019-12-02T20:12:14  <Bosmon> Maybe I'll get some time on the train tomorrow
2019-12-02T20:13:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, I'll do that. I'm also getting it with a plain object being passed to prefPrioritized, the array is set to the property inside of prefPrioritized
2019-12-02T20:13:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, I wonder if this will work at all because I'm still not seeing the value supplied from the context awareness supplied grade
2019-12-02T20:13:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh wait, I remember now
2019-12-02T20:13:49  <Bosmon> This mergePolicy is a higher-order one
2019-12-02T20:14:03  <Bosmon> It is expecting to produce a whole hash-worth of mergePolicies rather than a single one
2019-12-02T20:14:23  <Justin_o> oh
2019-12-02T20:14:51  <Bosmon> You will need to write your own mergePolicy that just contains the inner loop of it
2019-12-02T20:14:51  <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/src/framework/core/js/Fluid.js#L2759-L2769
2019-12-02T20:14:54  <Bosmon> The part within fluid.each
2019-12-02T20:16:05  <Justin_o> okay, I'll give that a go

2019-12-02T20:20:08  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in case a little orientation helps about what is going on, recall that mergePolicies are actually reduce functions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
2019-12-02T20:20:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. I'll take a look at that
2019-12-02T20:21:09  <Bosmon> You can ignore anything beyond the first two arguments in both versions
2019-12-02T20:21:22  <Bosmon> You won't need the mergePolicyHolder bit in your slimline function
2019-12-02T20:22:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, I had that commented out and converted all the target[key] to target and one source to source
2019-12-02T20:22:19  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yup, sounds good
2019-12-02T20:22:37  <Justin_o> that seems to have solved the mergePolicy issue
