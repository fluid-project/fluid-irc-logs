2020-10-22T11:28:01  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I updated this repo to use "main" instead of "master", but I can't tell how it's deployed. https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org
2020-10-22T11:28:08  <Justin_o> not sure if something else needs to be updated
2020-10-22T12:29:23  <Justin_o> gtirloni: can the ci-service repo be archived? if not what do we need to update related to the master->main changes? https://github.com/fluid-project/ci-service
2020-10-22T13:25:44  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, the pair of pulls to add CSS linting to fluid-grunt-lint-all and infusion seems ready.
2020-10-22T13:30:39  <the-t-in-rtf> There's also still the other one to update ESLint.
2020-10-22T13:30:48  <the-t-in-rtf> if we're cuttitng 2.x, we'd need to agree on the lot.
2020-10-22T13:30:56  <the-t-in-rtf> There was some last feedback for you on that one.
2020-10-22T13:31:18  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, on the infusion pull associated with the ESLint update to fluid-grunt-lint-all.
2020-10-22T13:31:28  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1013
2020-10-22T13:50:02  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that pull looks ok in general, but weren't we waiting for there to be a release to validate it against?
2020-10-22T13:57:39  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but there was uncommented feedback from Justin
2020-10-22T13:57:40  <the-t-in-rtf> mainly notes
2020-10-22T13:57:50  <the-t-in-rtf> just wanted to confirm that you are otherwise happy with my cutting the release
2020-10-22T13:58:05  <the-t-in-rtf> and merging the two fluid-grunt-lint-all pulls
2020-10-22T13:58:20  <Uttara> cindyli: do you have time for a quick call before the check-in? want to run some things by you
2020-10-22T13:59:28  <cindyli> sure, Uttara. see you in the wecount room?
2020-10-22T13:59:44  <Uttara> SINDYLI: YES SEE YOU
2020-10-22T14:00:09  <Uttara> sorry!! yes cindyli: see you
2020-10-22T14:01:13  <cindyli> ok. i'm in there
2020-10-22T14:02:11  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I'm looking at the two "main" pulls against fluid-express and fluid-glob.
2020-10-22T14:02:41  <the-t-in-rtf> Just to confirm, I assume this is the kind of change that can be incorporated into the next release rather than requiring one just for its own sake.
2020-10-22T14:03:12  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. once the pulls are merged the next pull will be compared against and have CI run against the renamed "main" branch, but the code is otherwise unchanged.
2020-10-22T14:03:55  <the-t-in-rtf> testing compatibility with node is a little greyer, but given that you didn't have to change anything in the code, I'd argue, same for that.
2020-10-22T14:04:37  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it doesn't affect my feedback on the pull, just confirming whether we want/need releases at the end.
2020-10-22T14:04:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I see the third one now.
2020-10-22T14:04:49  <the-t-in-rtf> Thank you for doing that, BTW.
2020-10-22T14:05:07  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yes, I don't think we'd need to cut a release for these changes.
2020-10-22T14:05:19  <the-t-in-rtf> Great, I'll work my way through them.
2020-10-22T14:05:56  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks... I probably have some more PRs coming for the other repos.. so you may see some more along the same lines today.
2020-10-22T14:06:12  <the-t-in-rtf> no worries, those are easy to handle.
2020-10-22T14:06:26  <the-t-in-rtf> not even as knotty as a typical dependency version bump
2020-10-22T14:07:21  <Justin_o> :) that's good to hear
2020-10-22T14:11:08  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: regarding your comment about the reference to infusion master, I left that because that repo hasn't been updated yet. Also it seems that GitHub is redirecting links to "master" to "main" for us.. so the link will still work after the update.
2020-10-22T14:11:30  <the-t-in-rtf> great, I'd still like a TODO with a link to the Infusion ticket if there is one.
2020-10-22T14:12:59  <Justin_o> there isn't yet.. let me see what needs to be updated in infusion
2020-10-22T14:13:16  <the-t-in-rtf> cool
2020-10-22T14:13:29  <the-t-in-rtf> unfortunately the fluid-testem one fails on node@14, just retrying that now
2020-10-22T14:14:55  <Justin_o> :( I wonder why
2020-10-22T14:15:38  <the-t-in-rtf> Well, I'm checking to see if stderr is empty, maybe that behaviour has changed.
2020-10-22T14:15:48  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll update and see what the error is.
2020-10-22T14:20:48  <the-t-in-rtf> same failure locally with node@14 and main
2020-10-22T14:21:12  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for looking into it
2020-10-22T14:21:31  <the-t-in-rtf> took me a minute, apple disabled chromedriver, I allowed it, then got to the error about the version not matching Chrome
2020-10-22T14:21:36  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I think I might just update infusion to main now and then I can just update the reference in the other PRs.
2020-10-22T14:21:53  <the-t-in-rtf> and then had to enable chromedriver again
2020-10-22T14:22:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, that sounds like a good idea
2020-10-22T14:22:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I was searching for the old wording as a check, it's better if we can just do the whole lot.
2020-10-22T14:24:20  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, so the check fails because there's now a trivial message to stderr.
2020-10-22T14:24:32  <the-t-in-rtf> "Debugger listening on ws://...."
2020-10-22T14:26:31  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: if you can point me to where to fix that I can add it to this PR if you like
2020-10-22T14:26:41  <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanks.
2020-10-22T14:28:35  <the-t-in-rtf> it should be an utterly trivial fix, I linked to the line to remove.
2020-10-22T14:41:59  <gtirloni> Justin_o: re: sojustrepairit.org, it seems to be deployed with Netlify but it's not in our main Netlify account. I'll check with Alan/Avtar about it
2020-10-22T14:42:12  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-10-22T14:42:14  <gtirloni> Justin_o: re: ci-service, it's still needed. I'll update the CI definitions to work with main
2020-10-22T14:42:21  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-10-22T15:24:34  <greatislander> morning gtirloni! I am wondering if you can tell me where guide.inclusivedesign.ca is deployed? There's a `gh-pages` branch but it seems quite outdated and I'm wondering if it can be safely deleted (I'm in the process of converting from Docpad to 11ty)
2020-10-22T15:26:19  <gtirloni> greatislander: hi! That one is generated from the master branch and the output of the `out` dir copied to the web server --- https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/blob/main/jenkins_jobs/website-guide.inclusivedesign.ca.yml#L14
2020-10-22T15:27:12  <gtirloni> I think gh-pages can be deleted
2020-10-22T15:28:11  <greatislander> okay, thanks!
2020-10-22T15:30:52  <greatislander> I will probably have more questions for you about this later, gtirloni :)
2020-10-22T15:31:24  <gtirloni> np :) there's a lot of stuff caught in different phases of migrations.. it's great we get the opportunity to standardize and fix them
2020-10-22T15:34:10  <Justin_o> greatislander, gtirloni: I was thinking that we might want to update build.fluidproject.org to be an 11ty site that can auto generate and deploy based on pushes to infusion and other referenced projects.. or maybe have each project have it's own build site.. not urgent but maybe something to think about
2020-10-22T15:34:32  <greatislander> Justin_o, gtirloni, definitely keen on that
2020-10-22T15:37:03  <gtirloni> Justin_o greatislander: that'd be great. I was considering each "build component" a separate site since they're so different.. I was planning on having something like build-videoplayer.fluidproject.org, build-infusion.fluidproject.org .. and link to them from the main site. That way they can have separate releases...  just an idea. But it would be awesome to tackle that. Most of them have Dockerfiles and I just need
2020-10-22T15:37:03  <gtirloni> to finish the deployment stages
2020-10-22T15:39:39  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I think that should be fine.. we might need to consider breaking URLs. If it isn't possible to preserve them, we may need to check with the community about that issue.
2020-10-22T15:39:50  <gtirloni> good point
2020-10-22T16:11:42  <Bosmon> Justin_o - is our talk about IRC/element upcoming?
2020-10-22T16:11:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it's happening now in the standup room
2020-10-22T16:11:54  <Bosmon> Ah oops
2020-10-22T16:11:57  <Justin_o> did you need a link?
2020-10-22T16:11:58  <Bosmon> Still on in the other room
2020-10-22T16:12:12  <Justin_o> ah.. is there anything you'd like to specifically bring up?
2020-10-22T16:12:15  <Justin_o> I can relay something
2020-10-22T16:12:38  <Bosmon> Well, perhaps not a great deal
2020-10-22T16:13:15  <Bosmon> I'd be generally interested if it would be feasible for us to create a relay from the new rooms back to IRC, which I believe is something that matrix can do ....
2020-10-22T16:14:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it's technically possible yes.. we were talking about that in some of our conversations... I'll bring it up in the meeting
2020-10-22T16:14:13  <Bosmon> Should be able to join in a minute or two
2020-10-22T16:16:14  <Justin_o> ah okay.. I'll leave it to you then, we're still talking about other things
2020-10-22T16:16:19  <Justin_o> related to matrix
2020-10-22T17:07:30  <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you think it would be possible to setup the matrix-irc bridge. I'm wondering if we should have it in place for the trial/proposal period
2020-10-22T17:16:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: would you be able to review this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1015 it just updates things to use "main" instead of "master"
2020-10-22T17:16:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I am already reviewing it : P
2020-10-22T17:16:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thank you :)
2020-10-22T17:29:24  *** jhung is now known as jhung_away
2020-10-22T17:31:32  <Justin_o> clown: did you still want to meet?
2020-10-22T17:31:58  <clown> yup, just gettin settled.  zoom?
2020-10-22T17:32:07  <Justin_o> clown: sure
2020-10-22T17:49:55  <colinclark> Justin_o: Iâ€™m not averse to setting up an IRC bridge for matrix...
2020-10-22T17:50:01  <colinclark> but I wonder if itâ€™s something we need to do now?
2020-10-22T17:50:34  <colinclark> Since it isnâ€™t a trivial technical taskâ€™
2020-10-22T17:51:11  <colinclark> I also wonder if it will get confusing while trying out Matrix
2020-10-22T17:52:30  <Justin_o> colinclark: I was worried about the latter too
2020-10-22T17:52:41  <Justin_o> unless we have a playground of sorts in matrix
2020-10-22T17:52:47  <colinclark> Iâ€™m also mindful of gtirloniâ€™s time while heâ€™s in the midst of planning our cloud migration
2020-10-22T17:52:49  <Justin_o> but it could still be confusing for those logged into both
2020-10-22T17:52:55  <colinclark> yeah, exactly
2020-10-22T17:53:17  <Justin_o> colinclark: anyways, the question was more around the proposal.. so I can mention it as something we can setup if we move over
2020-10-22T17:53:27  <colinclark> yeah, that seems reasonable
2020-10-22T17:53:28  <colinclark> ok cool
2020-10-22T17:53:36  <colinclark> I know Bosmon was interested in the idea
2020-10-22T18:09:16  *** jhung_away is now known as jhung
2020-10-22T18:18:18  <gtirloni> colinclark: thanks! yeah, it would require some time here.. I have no idea how it works or how to implement it. consider it a separate project for me if possible
2020-10-22T18:24:09  <colinclark> yup
2020-10-22T18:24:19  <colinclark> I figure letâ€™s only do it if we really need to
2020-10-22T18:24:26  <colinclark> itâ€™s there as a possibility if needed
2020-10-22T20:27:40  <gmoss> Justin_o: I had to take care of a couple of things around the house, so I'm going to be working into the evening. I don't think I'll have the updates to the Storytelling Tool's GitHub Actions workflows until after you're done for the day, in case you were waiting on them
2020-10-22T20:28:24  <gmoss> (I'm focusing on filing issues for SJRK-20 first)
2020-10-22T20:35:43  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay no problem, thanks for letting me know
2020-10-22T21:56:43  <gmoss> Justin_o: filed for whenever you're ready to merge: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/97
2020-10-22T21:56:47  <gmoss> and the associated Jira: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-412
