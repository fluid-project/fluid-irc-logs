2019-05-28T12:36:55  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: hi there!
2019-05-28T12:36:57  <javjarfer[m]> I have been working into the Mocks.js issue regarding configure actions, initial work is here https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/772/files
2019-05-28T12:37:06  <javjarfer[m]> I can't yet figure out, why I get this error: "Cannot look up name gpii.test.integration.actionHandlersAware.mockActionsHandlers.gpii.windows.rm to a function with registered argumentMap - got defaults undefined", for me function looks properly defined
2019-05-28T12:39:59  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - did you issue some defaults for it?
2019-05-28T12:42:22  <stegru> Bosmon: open usb: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/f430f8fde29e64d6145007fd2c3ebb1cbaff1ad0/src/main/common/utils.js#L200
2019-05-28T12:42:32  <stegru> eject is not merged, but very similar
2019-05-28T12:45:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I thought so, this line https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/772/files#diff-1e7b4157b5f31fe3620025d10feab28fR596
2019-05-28T12:50:51  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - looks reasonable - does the defaults block actually execute? : P
2019-05-28T12:51:46  <Bosmon> I think you can get rid of the path segment "actionHandlersAware" from the overall big name, but other than that, this seems reasonable
2019-05-28T12:51:53  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - from what stack frame do you get the error?
2019-05-28T12:52:52  <Bosmon> Also - can't we fold the "mockExecHandler" into the same scheme?

2019-05-28T15:46:48  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - what was the idea?
2019-05-28T15:47:30  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the issue should in theory be fairly straightforward - if the defaults have been registered before you query them, and they have not been overwritten, you should be able to retrieve them : P
2019-05-28T15:47:50  <Bosmon> Why don't you put a conditional breakpoint in fluid.defaults that stops when the name matches?
2019-05-28T15:48:02  <Bosmon> Or you can just put a conditional logging statement in there
2019-05-28T15:48:43  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I think I have it working, I think it was sadly a typo in the grade name I should put in the tests definition....
