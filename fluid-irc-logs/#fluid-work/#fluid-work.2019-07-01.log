2019-07-01T13:15:12  <stegru> hi jhernandez, do I have time to slip in a fix for the tray icon not always showing?
2019-07-01T13:21:19  <jhernandez> stegru: of course
2019-07-01T13:21:30  <jhernandez> we're not buliding the installer yet
2019-07-01T13:21:53  <jhernandez> as I said to Sandra, I started putting things together locally and seeing that there are no terrible conflicts or breaking anything
2019-07-01T13:27:16  <stegru> ok that's good
2019-07-01T13:33:03  <jhernandez> stegru: tomorrow we're meeting to see if we're good to create the installer
2019-07-01T13:33:08  <jhernandez> ;)

2019-07-01T15:41:42  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey, I see that you merged Cindy's enhancements on the security checks for NOVA
2019-07-01T15:42:48  <jhernandez> question, shall we draft a plan for testing this before taking it to production? shall we add this one to the pending one that includes the last changes from Tony?
2019-07-01T15:43:12  <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes, what stage is the testing at for ADTKIN's pull?
2019-07-01T15:44:16  <jhernandez> and I also wanted to double check with you/Cindy about the security checks? what will happen to the clients using the old schema when the new one is deployed? will they keep working normally?
2019-07-01T15:45:01  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I'm wondering now if it might not have been a bit soon to merge it, given we still need to think about the migration plan
2019-07-01T15:46:27  <jhernandez> last news from Tony about his last improvements is: "I think the performance problems have been dealt with, but would like to review
2019-07-01T15:46:31  <jhernandez> and then I need to put in a new ticket/pull with more details than before
2019-07-01T15:46:33  <jhernandez> I can put the pull in tomorrow morning"
2019-07-01T15:46:40  <jhernandez> that was on Thursday
2019-07-01T15:46:52  <jhernandez> I'll check with him tomorrow
2019-07-01T15:47:00  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I guess this would be the pull against the infrastructure?
2019-07-01T15:47:31  <jhernandez> about being merged Cindy's pull - not a big deal, we have control over what veersion of unniversal gets deployed to prd
2019-07-01T15:47:43  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yeah, that's the pull against gpii-infra
2019-07-01T15:48:11  <jhernandez> but can't see it around - I'll check with Tony tomorrow morning
2019-07-01T15:49:02  <Bosmon> ok no worries
2019-07-01T15:49:48  <jhernandez> yup
2019-07-01T15:49:51  <jhernandez> thanks
