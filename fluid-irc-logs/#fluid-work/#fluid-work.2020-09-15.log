2020-09-15T14:05:54  <cindyli> Justin_o: only hosts of a zoom meeting can record the meeting. When we have wecount team meetings, none of us are hosts. do you know if it's possible that someone or even everyone in a zoom meeting still be able to record the meeting?
2020-09-15T14:07:33  <jhung> cindyli tenporary Host privs can be given so you can record the meeting.
2020-09-15T14:08:47  <Justin_o> cindyli: who usually attends those meetings?
2020-09-15T14:12:35  <cindyli> Justin_o: Antranig, Philip, Ted, myself usually attend all meetings. Vera, David, Uttara and Lisa will join Monday meetings
2020-09-15T14:13:06  <cindyli> great to know there's a temporary host priv
2020-09-15T14:17:30  <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. I can update so that David and vera can also have host privileges. However, if I update I have to change the room password.
2020-09-15T14:17:40  <Justin_o> If that's okay, I can PM it to you.
2020-09-15T14:18:01  <cindyli> sure. thanks, Justin_o
2020-09-15T14:18:10  <Justin_o> cindyli: right now colinclark, michelled, and myself have host privileges for that room.
2020-09-15T14:18:44  <cindyli> michelled no longer comes to wecount meetings
2020-09-15T14:19:21  <Justin_o> cindyli: I aded jhung as well and Bert also has permissions.
2020-09-15T14:25:36  <michelled> cindyli: when I'm available, I can join the meeting just long enough to make you a host
2020-09-15T14:25:46  <michelled> I know this isn't ideal, but we can try that for a bit
2020-09-15T14:27:53  <cindyli> thanks, michelled. we don't need to record every meeting. when there's one that needs to be recorded, I will ping one of you to join and grant permissions
2020-09-15T15:10:33  <Justin_o> jhung: I addressed your comments for https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/149

2020-09-15T16:05:13  <Justin_o> jhung, colinclark, michelled: do you have time this week to chat about the IUI project?
2020-09-15T16:05:40  <michelled> yup! when is good?
2020-09-15T16:06:15  <Justin_o> michelled: good question :)
2020-09-15T16:06:50  <michelled> maybe after standup on Thursday?
2020-09-15T16:07:10  <Justin_o> that could work.. let me see if there is a talk planned for then
2020-09-15T16:08:11  <Justin_o> I'll send out an e-mail to everyone to see if that time works.
