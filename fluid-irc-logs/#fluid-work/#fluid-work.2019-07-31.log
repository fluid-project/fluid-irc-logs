2019-07-31T12:36:10  <javjarfer[m]> Hi! There was a scheduled onboarding meeting now true?
2019-07-31T12:36:30  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m] - yes, I think since most of us are away we can push it out
2019-07-31T12:36:35  <Bosmon> Was there anything you wanted to talk about?
2019-07-31T12:37:30  <javjarfer[m]> not particularly, if you can in an async way take a look to my new priority list, which is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vhhzs0pLCYPyLDPXpWNVUrwVvTv8IoGhRHsUUiA7gJk/edit#gid=1519274796
2019-07-31T12:37:57  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: you know, just to make sure that the team knows what I'm doing right now
2019-07-31T12:38:47  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - sure - we should go back to our old pirate pad and check what happened to any previous outstanding work
2019-07-31T12:39:32  <javjarfer[m]> yes, agree
2019-07-31T12:39:36  <Bosmon> But the top 3 priorities on that sheet look reasonable
2019-07-31T12:40:11  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I'm mostly done with the first 3
2019-07-31T12:40:48  <javjarfer[m]> I mean, there's one setting left of the Read&Write impl, but we have some technical debt for making it work with gpii-app that I don't know if reached master
2019-07-31T12:41:08  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/pull/3
2019-07-31T12:41:18  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - as I understood there is a fix needed in core which cindyli will work on shortly
2019-07-31T12:41:48  <javjarfer[m]> oh, for this particular one? okay
2019-07-31T12:41:58  <Bosmon> I dunno, for RWG in general
2019-07-31T12:43:11  <javjarfer[m]> okay, will be talking with cindyli about it then, and I just need to finish a pull I have for the mouse one, and simply update the ones for the magnifier
2019-07-31T12:43:18  <javjarfer[m]> so, most of it should be ready today

2019-07-31T13:03:18  <Justin_o> cindyli: do you remember if you published a version of UIO+ while I was away?
2019-07-31T13:09:32  <cindyli> let me check…
2019-07-31T13:12:26  <cindyli> Justin_o: i think yes since the updated date for beta 11 is Mar 8, 2019: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek
2019-07-31T13:13:15  <Justin_o> Thanks.. yes.. I saw that, which is why I asked.. I don't see any changes in the repo around that time though

2019-07-31T13:32:20  <Justin_o> cindyli: can you do me a favour and test UIO+ in chrome on macOS. I'm finding that the adjusters seem to work, but don't always update their own state. For example you increase size and them numbers don't change but the content does. Or you toggle a switch and it does't move, but the change is enacted.
2019-07-31T13:36:17  <cindyli> ok

2019-07-31T13:40:46  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, that's good.. I think there must be something wrong with my setup.. the performance is not good... it's actually gotten worse and I've removed other extenisions and reinstalled everything ;(
2019-07-31T13:40:52  <Justin_o> cindyli: are you on the new or old Mac?

2019-07-31T14:43:15  <cindyli> sorry, was distracted to another thing, Justin_o. reinstalled and tested. all adjusters work fine. there were 2 UIO+ icons on the toolbar was because I had both beta 10 and 11 installed. how do you find the monitor issue?
2019-07-31T14:44:38  <Justin_o> I just thought it might be a rendering issue, and opened chrome on my laptop screen instead of the external monitor. Things worked fine there
2019-07-31T14:44:50  <Justin_o> I can move it back and forth and see the issue in the external monitor but not on the laptop's screen
