2020-06-28T13:36:51  <dmahajan980> Hi everyone, are the hooks in jqUnit passed in a different format than what QUnit has specified in their documentation?
2020-06-28T13:48:01  <stegru> dmahajan980: I'm not an expert in either, but here's an example I've done: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/4ef4cecd84e44e984ff59ae11db3c9e27e383ca2/gpii/node_modules/processHandling/test/testProcessHandling.js#L38
2020-06-28T13:54:39  <dmahajan980> Thanks @stegru. I've been trying to do the same, but the hooks won't run.
2020-06-28T13:55:11  <dmahajan980> I guess you're using custom hooks.
2020-06-28T14:41:54  <sbates> dmahajan980: you may already be aware of these resources, but these may help, if not. jqUnit HTML docs: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/jqUnit.html and the source code: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/jqUnit/js/jqUnit.js
2020-06-28T14:44:10  <dmahajan980> Thanks @sbates for sharing these links. These might help with what I'm missing.
