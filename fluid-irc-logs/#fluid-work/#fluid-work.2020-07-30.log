2020-07-30T13:47:02  <cindyli> hi raunak, regarding your question at https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/350#issuecomment-666231798, I'm only on IRC during my work hours: 9-4:30 EST weekdays.
2020-07-30T13:50:38  <cindyli> regarding what issues you can work on, I'll discuss with _Teddy today when he's online to figure out what you can work on. to help us make decision on that, do you have knowledge on any of these:
2020-07-30T13:50:44  <cindyli> 1. Eleventy (https://www.11ty.dev/)
2020-07-30T13:50:50  <cindyli> 2. netlify functions (https://functions.netlify.com/tutorials/)
2020-07-30T13:50:58  <cindyli> 3. vue.js (https://vuejs.org/)
2020-07-30T15:07:14  <Justin_o> cindyli, Teddy___, gtirloni: it might be worth tracking this https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/16177
2020-07-30T15:07:43  <Justin_o> It will allow us to track some real world performance along with the other metrics covered by Matomo
2020-07-30T15:13:03  <cindyli> Justin_o: thanks. it would be really useful if Matomo as a tracking server can track web vitals in real life
2020-07-30T15:15:37  <gtirloni> Justin_o: nice! subscribed
2020-07-30T15:16:19  <cindyli> google analytics already tracks it
2020-07-30T15:16:38  <cindyli> https://www.virendrachandak.com/techtalk/how-to-track-web-vitals-in-google-analytics/
2020-07-30T15:17:52  <Justin_o> cindyli: Google makes the web-vitals tool so they also have info on the integration right on the repo https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-analytics
2020-07-30T15:18:54  <Justin_o> cindyli: although the argument that Findus23 makes on the Matomo issue is worth considering https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/16177#issuecomment-653897109
2020-07-30T15:38:13  <Justin_o> colinclark, greatislander: I found this comparison of chat tools. Not sure how up-to-date it is though, but could help as a starting point for comparing things. Or another means of gathering some info on a specific tool(s) https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_on_open_source_team_communication_tools
2020-07-30T16:00:25  <greatislander> thanks for sharing that, Justin_o!
2020-07-30T16:05:15  <colinclark> gmoss: You mentioned that gpii-location-bar-relay was removed from the npm registry, but itâ€™s still there. Just deprecated in favour of the fluid- equivalent.
2020-07-30T16:05:25  <colinclark> So it can still be installed as needed, etc.
2020-07-30T16:05:37  <colinclark> seems like that was the right approach
2020-07-30T16:05:38  <gmoss> colinclark: oh, I wasn't able to find it when I searched yesterday, curious
2020-07-30T16:05:45  <colinclark> https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpii-location-bar-relay/v/1.0.5-dev.20200128T132941Z.86c73d0.GPII-2131
2020-07-30T16:06:16  <gmoss> maybe I entered the name incorrectly. Glad to know it's still there, I agree that's the best approach :)
2020-07-30T16:06:29  <cindyli> raunak: you can work on this issue: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/256
2020-07-30T16:07:48  <cindyli> i cannot assign the ticket to you yet as you are not a IDRC team member. but you probably can assign it to yourself, or once you have a comment or contribute to this issue, you will appear in the "assignees" list. thanks
2020-07-30T18:41:01  <dogeman> gmoss have you filled the phase 2 evaluations?
2020-07-30T18:42:19  <gmoss> dogeman: I will let you know when I have submitted the evaluation. Once again, rest assured it will be submitted before the deadline
2020-07-30T19:24:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: I've tested Story telling tool in Safari. It's basically the same as last time except I believe we can close SJRK-186 https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-186
2020-07-30T19:26:01  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome :) 186 is no longer an issue on Windows Chrome, but I'll keep an eye out in the other environments to see if it persists
2020-07-30T19:27:17  <Justin_o> gmoss: sounds good
2020-07-30T19:27:34  <Justin_o> gmoss: also let me know if we're good to push up the tag
2020-07-30T19:27:41  <Justin_o> if/when
2020-07-30T19:30:59  <gmoss> Justin_o: as in when we're good to tag the current master with 0.3.0? I think that should wait until after the package.json is updated
2020-07-30T19:31:43  <gmoss> but I suppose it should also wait until testing is complete and we know we don't have any blockers
2020-07-30T19:32:36  <Justin_o> gmoss: package.json has been updateed
2020-07-30T19:32:43  <Justin_o> updated so just waiting on the testing
2020-07-30T19:33:06  <Justin_o> gmoss: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/package.json#L3
2020-07-30T19:35:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome :) thanks for doing that!
2020-07-30T19:39:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: no problem. I'm sort of going offline now, but I'll come back and check on things later and will push the tag if you give me the green light
2020-07-30T19:41:01  <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good, thanks
2020-07-30T19:41:11  <gmoss> nearly done Chrome tests, Firefox and iPad after that
2020-07-30T19:41:22  <gmoss> so far so good
2020-07-30T20:24:35  <gmoss> cindyli Justin_o: testing complete, no new issues, some of the previous ones didn't appear again (woohoo). I give my approval for tagging and deployment :)
2020-07-30T20:24:40  <gmoss> I will also close SJRK-186
2020-07-30T20:28:47  <gmoss> just prepping the release notes right now
2020-07-30T20:35:51  <gmoss> cindyli Justin_o: here are some draft release notes for 0.3.0: https://gist.github.com/BlueSlug/f59daba1bb15e665a6e7ef9795eae2d4
2020-07-30T21:13:14  <colinclark> congrats, gmoss
2020-07-30T21:13:21  <gmoss> thanks colinclark :)
2020-07-30T21:50:22  <Justin_o> gmoss: tag and GitHub Release created https://github.com/jobara/sjrk-story-telling/releases/tag/0.3.0
2020-07-30T21:51:02  <gmoss> Justin_o: is it possible to amend the release notes? I added a comment to my gist mentioning FLUID-6512
2020-07-30T21:51:14  <gmoss> also, thanks! :)
2020-07-30T21:51:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, the GitHub releases can be modified after the fact
2020-07-30T21:53:03  <gmoss> Justin_o: great :) I'm going to go afk to buy a part for my bicycle, I'll check in again later on this evening
2020-07-30T21:53:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, it's updated
