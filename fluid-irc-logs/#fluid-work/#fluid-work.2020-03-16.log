2020-03-16T09:28:04  <zaidbj[m]> I  have been using the infusion doc website ,and I wonder if It could be a SPA, I know that  we are using docpad as the SSG,but  don't know much about SSGs, can someone let me know more about this
2020-03-16T09:28:28  <sachin10101998> More about what zaiddbj[m]
2020-03-16T09:30:07  <zaidbj[m]> If the website could be a SPA with the current SSG
2020-03-16T09:30:31  <sachin10101998> SPA?
2020-03-16T09:30:39  <zaidbj[m]> Single page app
2020-03-16T09:31:07  <sachin10101998> we don't need one
2020-03-16T09:31:15  <sachin10101998> SSGs serve the purpose without overhead costs
2020-03-16T09:31:34  <sachin10101998> Justin_o or gmoss would be able to shed better light on this though
2020-03-16T09:32:26  <zaidbj[m]> I googled and found that Gatsby provides a similar experience of SPA
2020-03-16T09:33:02  <sachin10101998> Gatsby is framework dependent and community guys would require good hold on react to work with it
2020-03-16T09:33:40  <sachin10101998> I researched about different SSgs for the migration project and that was one of the major cons of gatsby. It's an overkill for the migration project
2020-03-16T09:33:52  <sachin10101998> Which project are you working on though?
2020-03-16T09:34:33  <zaidbj[m]> Using a game controller as a Navigation aid
2020-03-16T09:35:18  <sachin10101998> I haven't read the details of that one. Why do you need to switch the SSG for that project?

2020-03-16T09:46:36  <nakul78> Hi, I am Nakul Tyagi an aspirant of GSOC 2020, currently a 3rd year BTech student of Bharati Vidyapeeth's College Of Engineering . I am a Web Developer and also loves developing games . I am interested to work on the Gamepad Navigation Aid project during Inclusive Design Institute's GSoC'20 program.We face problem of using mouse in between games or
2020-03-16T09:46:37  <nakul78> videos many times which really gets frustrating as it just breaks the rhythm of the player or the viewer. Now with increasing gaming and streaming reach this problem needs to be solved quickly to provide users a better experience .I would like to help solving this problem as it is affecting a large group of community members and users.My 30 minutes
2020-03-16T09:46:37  <nakul78> of experience of browsing the web without a mouse can be found here:https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-introductory-experience-of-browsing-the-web-for-30-minutes-with-only-a-keyboard/answer/Nakul-Tyagi-9?prompt_topic_bio=1Technical Aspects and Solution,1. During my analysis I experienced that navigating on a particular application or site with a lot
2020-03-16T09:46:38  <nakul78> of content is tough , going to the content directly really needs some hard work so it is better to use search bar if available or using javascript we can add feature to access different elements on page at a time. 2.Shortcuts for switching applications and tabs must be mapped with the gamepad for easy navigation.3.For easy and accurate search
2020-03-16T09:46:38  <nakul78> search by voice feature can help .4. Voice to text feature can help in filling forms and other fields.As far as my exploration goes till now we can use Gamepad API that allows us to access the state of connected gamepads using JavaScript,with the help of this these games can now be played on the web with the same gamepads that are used for
2020-03-16T09:46:39  <nakul78> consoles.The Chrome functionalities can be added using Chrome Extension -chrome.tabs API.For mapping the keys to a gamepad we can use javascript in frontend to handle the mapping and Gamepad.mapping feature of the Gamepad.I hope you like my inputs and solutions. I am eagerly waiting for mentors reviews and suggestions . I would really like to
2020-03-16T09:46:39  <nakul78> contribute to this projects as it matches my skills set perfectly.
2020-03-16T09:47:24  <sachin10101998> nakul78 you should consider sending this on the fluid work mailing list

2020-03-16T10:41:10  <kasparnet> Bosmon, morning
2020-03-16T10:41:28  <Bosmon> kasparnet!

2020-03-16T10:43:10  <kasparnet> I wanted to check in with you on 3 things:
2020-03-16T10:44:32  <kasparnet> Are we in more panic now, than we were in friday wrt to the broken CI? Or do we still trust in the plan of merging cindy and stegru's work, and then looking at universal/hatkins stuff afterwards

2020-03-16T10:44:59  <kasparnet> also, would you be up for meeting with HA to talk about onboarding the morphic QSS
2020-03-16T10:46:02  <kasparnet> or would it make more sense to have someone else do that (who?) given the huge amount of pull requests and fire extinguishing on your plate?
2020-03-16T10:46:27  <ghyjkhu> But how to contact them personally.
2020-03-16T10:46:45  <kasparnet> and finally, hope you and the family are good and well, despite your govenments tactics of ignoring the corona, hoping it'll go away :)
2020-03-16T10:46:48  <kasparnet> Bosmon, ^
2020-03-16T10:48:33  <Bosmon> kasparnet - I'm experimenting with stegru's stuff now, I'll let you know in a bit
2020-03-16T10:48:49  <Bosmon> As per ADTKINS we are very lucky that his school has not closed so he'll be able to look at the universal stuff tomorrow
2020-03-16T10:49:10  <Bosmon> kasparnet - likewise for you and hope you are keeping quiet and well

2020-03-16T13:18:07  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I just saw that, but not sure I have time right now, sorry.  I'll try to look at it again later, but it's one that may drop off if we are switching the underlying platform anyways.
2020-03-16T13:18:24  <sachin10101998> Sure
2020-03-16T13:19:56  <Saad> Justin_o: There are two types of Safari extension. One is Safari legacy extension (old type) and the other one is Safari App Extension. Apple has depreciated the Safari Legacy Extension since Safari 12. Safari App Extension is limited. It does not supports Tab API. Also, in it, we can use same content scripts but background scripts need to be written in  Swift or Objective C. Are we going with the legacy extensions or Safari App extension. And if Safa
2020-03-16T13:19:56  <Saad> ri App Extension, won't it be a problem as we want to use the same codebase as much as possible?
2020-03-16T13:22:59  <Justin_o> Saad: so this is good research. It may be that we have to do something different for safari, so it's good to look into it and include as much information as possible. Given how frequently users tend to update macOS I don't think we'll be supporting legacy extensions. Part of the project is to research and investigate any potential issues.
2020-03-16T13:25:00  <Saad> Justin_o: I will do more research on it and add it in my proposal then.
2020-03-16T13:25:10  <Justin_o> Saad: sounds good, thanks

2020-03-16T14:59:40  <colinclark> Next, you’ll want to start thinking about what your project’s plan and roadmap might look like, for your proposal

2020-03-16T17:39:20  <amankumar> instead of hugo
2020-03-16T17:40:48  <amankumar> with certain research work i think gatsby will be much better than hugo or jekyll

2020-03-16T18:04:49  <sachin10101998> Would it be a good idea o shift from Jenkins to GA given that our repos are already present on github
2020-03-16T18:05:21  <sachin10101998> Or is there something already discussed before Jenkins was chosen which I might have missed
2020-03-16T18:06:02  <sachin10101998> Older Mailing list only gave hints about choice of CMS for few projects and I was writing about the choice of Automation server and stumbled upon GA
2020-03-16T18:06:40  <sachin10101998> Isn't GA a more viable option for FLOE and Fluid
2020-03-16T18:07:09  <Justin_o> we've been using Jenkins for a while. GitHub Actions only recently became available in a stable form.
2020-03-16T18:07:47  <sachin10101998> Do you have issues that migrating to GA might cause which you can think on top of your head
2020-03-16T18:07:54  <Justin_o> GitHub Actions is something we could and may consider switching too, but is something would need to be discussed more

However, I think it might make more sense to look at it in the context of the related GSoC projects and see where those go. There may be some dependencies on the technology used, if the hosting location changes, and etc.

2020-03-16T18:58:25  <sachin10101998> Alright, I'd research more about it and try to accommodate it in the proposed work timeline.

2020-03-16T18:59:53  <sachin10101998> colinclark can you think of some dependencies which might be affected by migrating to GA that I should take care of as Junstin_o mentioned
2020-03-16T19:03:16  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I concur, it's worth exploring at the very least! In addition to researching possible dependency issues, it would also be good to consider what effect that migration would have on the scope of the work
2020-03-16T19:03:46  <gmoss> *the scope of the GSoC project
2020-03-16T19:05:30  <sachin10101998> Hmm , I'd look into it. I have prioritized various tasks in the draft proposal and successful migration to a modern SSG is at top and should be completed by end of phase 1 evaluation.
2020-03-16T19:06:06  <sachin10101998> I'm not sure what you meant by scope of the project. I believe you mean that migration to GA should not affect the main goal of the project. Am I right?

2020-03-16T19:08:11  <gmoss> sachin10101998: that's right, but also that the work of doing that migration, whether alongside or after the main goal, doesn't take too long to complete, i.e. that it can be done within the GSoC timeline

2020-03-16T19:09:20  <sachin10101998> gmoss Ahh I see. I haven't worked with Github Actions before this and I'd have to research more about the time it would take for successful migration. I'd keep you posted about it.
2020-03-16T19:10:01  <sachin10101998> jhung views?
2020-03-16T19:11:29  <gmoss> Rehan: welcome, please feel free to ask your questions here in this channel or on our mailing list!
2020-03-16T19:11:38  <jhung> sachin10101998 what gmoss said makes sense to me. You would have to prioritize that migration to GH Actions against other goals you have in the project. You may want to priotize it lower / later in the project depending on the outcome of the other priorities.
2020-03-16T19:12:08  <sachin10101998> sure thing. I'd keep a check on that jhung
2020-03-16T19:13:01  <Rehan>  so we have to make a chrome extension which will assist us in using a gaming pad as a navigation air on all other websites ?
2020-03-16T19:13:19  <Justin_o> jhung, gmoss, sachin10101998: it's probably worth weighing in the cost of updating the existing CI to work with whatever is changed post SSG migration
2020-03-16T19:14:18  <Justin_o> Rehan: you'll need to talk to the-t-in-rtf about that project; however the-t-in-rtf is not currently online. It might be better to send the question to the fluid-work mailing list.
2020-03-16T19:15:56  <sachin10101998> Justin_o cost as in? Github actions is free for public repos
2020-03-16T19:16:19  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I mean time/effort cost
2020-03-16T19:16:29  <sachin10101998> Ohhh.
2020-03-16T19:16:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: I agree, it's possible that GA will take as much or less time to implement as adjusting the current Jenkins jobs

2020-03-16T20:13:11  <the-t-in-rtf> Hii, @Shyamal, Electron is only a candidate technology, part of the project is evaluating a range of options and picking the technology to use.
2020-03-16T20:13:42  <the-t-in-rtf> So don't focus on it too much, especially implementation details.
2020-03-16T20:14:03  <the-t-in-rtf> Right now you just need to look for things that can a) accept input from a gamepad and b) send key presses to a browser
2020-03-16T20:16:52  <Shyamal> Okay. Thanks! Since I was working on the proposal, so should I specify the available options that we can use in the proposal?

2020-03-16T21:48:24  <SemicolonExp> the-t-in-rtf re: the discussion re: technologies, I was wondering what the difference between using a web based technologies vs application based technologies and why we would be using web. What I mean by that is that it should not be hard at all to develop a windows or linux application that maps gamepad keys to keyboard keys.
2020-03-16T21:49:05  <SemicolonExp> Shortcuts should still work in browser, but you would have the added benefits of using windows or linux commands too with the gamepad
2020-03-16T21:49:32  <SemicolonExp> aw man I just missed him
2020-03-16T21:51:20  <zaidbj[m]> SemicolonExp: a similar technology is https://keysticks.net/
2020-03-16T21:51:34  <zaidbj[m]> Or a steam controller
2020-03-16T21:52:01  <SemicolonExp> Right but my question is why we're doing web specific vs general os application
2020-03-16T21:53:10  <zaidbj[m]> But I doubt if it is really that easy to make a windows for the same
2020-03-16T21:53:11  <SemicolonExp> because as the steam controller shows you an easily have an application that takes a game controller and map keys/ functionalities to buttons and joysticks
2020-03-16T21:54:18  <zaidbj[m]> I don't know much about windows apps, but will it really be that simple

2020-03-16T22:06:07  <SemicolonExp> the one i can think of is that a browser extension is functionally easier for the end user and they might be more willing to download an extention vs installing a program
2020-03-16T22:06:17  <SemicolonExp> and automatic launching
2020-03-16T22:07:22  <zaidbj[m]> SemicolonExp: time could be a factor, as steam controller also took quite a time to develop ,same shall be the case with others, so here we might be trying to focus just on the browsers
2020-03-16T22:08:22  <SemicolonExp> I thought the time involved with the development of the steam controller was more hardware related than software
2020-03-16T22:08:28  <SemicolonExp> but I can see how time might be an issue
2020-03-16T22:08:28  <zaidbj[m]> SemicolonExp: for the browser navigation even I think the same , extension is a more suitable solution, we can later port it to Firefox
2020-03-16T22:08:59  <SemicolonExp> I definitely like the chrome extension idea vs a universal extension
2020-03-16T22:09:48  <zaidbj[m]> Apart from time , difficulty level of the project would have surely be an issue😅, at least for me
2020-03-16T22:10:26  <SemicolonExp> Are you more of a web developer vs application?
2020-03-16T22:11:24  <zaidbj[m]> I don't have much experience with windows application
2020-03-16T22:12:03  <SemicolonExp> Linux applications?
2020-03-16T22:12:17  <zaidbj[m]> Same
2020-03-16T22:13:01  <zaidbj[m]> SemicolonExp: do you have any experience with it?
2020-03-16T22:15:08  <SemicolonExp> A little bit, but it was mainly writing them in a linux environment and then turning them into exes that can run on windows (I do admit that its annoying process and i didn't like setting up the environment to be able to do so)
2020-03-16T22:15:25  <SemicolonExp> I think if you can write it in csharp however it makes things a lot easier
2020-03-16T22:16:51  <zaidbj[m]> We can clarify on this issue further once the-t-in-rtf  is online
