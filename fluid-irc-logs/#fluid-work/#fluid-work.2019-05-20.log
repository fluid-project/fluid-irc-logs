2019-05-20T13:47:36  <stegru> fyi jhernand_ , my "fix" is just to add the service settings to the installer (haven't done it yet)
2019-05-20T13:47:57  <jhernand_> stegru: hey, I thought it was just that
2019-05-20T13:48:32  <jhernand_> don't worry, it's something either you or I can do when it's the "right time"
2019-05-20T13:48:36  <stegru> do you know if maureen is still there?
2019-05-20T13:49:06  <stegru> yes, in fact I've already made an installer which just performs the fix, so we cna just copy+paste it
2019-05-20T13:49:07  <jhernand_> not sure - I think she was flying back to Cali on Friday
2019-05-20T13:49:44  <jhernand_> stegru: yeah - we can just copy/paste that

2019-05-20T23:48:50  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf1: Hey Tony.  I'm trying to spin up a proper VM to run the gpii-handlebars tests as it says to in the README, but I don't see a Vagrantfile in the repo, and it's asking me to manually perform some other init steps to initialize the VM environment.  Is that expected? I've never actually used Vagrant outside of a repo that doens't have a Vagrantfile?
2019-05-20T23:49:04  <sgithens> I merged master into my branch so it should be up to date
2019-05-20T23:49:45  <sgithens> I'm looking at the lint comments to you added GPII-3698
