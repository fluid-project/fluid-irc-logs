2020-10-06T15:19:52  <cindyli> i see. got it. working on..
2020-10-06T16:15:20  <gmoss> cindyli Justin_o (and greatislander): yesterday we were chatting about which talks from Jamstack Conf we might want to attend, but it looks like they'll all be recorded and links are going to be distributed to attendees
2020-10-06T16:15:32  <greatislander> gmoss cool cool
2020-10-06T16:15:39  <cindyli> that's great
2020-10-06T16:15:44  <gmoss> yeah :) so we don't have to split ourselves in 4 haha
2020-10-06T16:15:51  <greatislander> I am admittedly curious about the Matt vs. Matt fireside talk (WordPress Matt vs. Netlify Matt)
2020-10-06T16:26:08  <Justin_o> gmoss: that's good news thanks for letting us know.
2020-10-06T17:31:46  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, I think we're about a sentence away from merging your docs pull, just took a look a it.
2020-10-06T17:33:28  <cindyli> good suggestions, the-t-in-rtf. just addressed them and pushed up.
2020-10-06T17:33:46  <the-t-in-rtf> awesome, nice working with you however briefly.
2020-10-06T17:34:42  <the-t-in-rtf> merged.
2020-10-06T17:35:06  <cindyli> thanks for the merge, the-t-in-rtf. cheers!
2020-10-06T17:35:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I will celebrate by opening my stash of huamei.
2020-10-06T17:38:04  <the-t-in-rtf> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_hing_mui
2020-10-06T17:39:21  <cindyli> haha, it took me a little while to figure out what huamei is. i thought only women like this kind of snack ;)
2020-10-06T17:40:02  <the-t-in-rtf> it was very popular in Hawaii
2020-10-06T17:40:15  <cindyli> ah ha. good to know
2020-10-06T18:33:05  <cindyli> Justin_o: i'm having an interesting issue with your FLUID-6554 PR. can we have a quick chat when you have time, so i can share my screen?
2020-10-06T18:44:22  <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, did you want to chat now?
2020-10-06T18:46:14  <cindyli> Justin_o: i just removed the version of the infusion i need for it. give me a couple of minutes to put it back. i'll ping u when it's ready. sorry
2020-10-06T18:46:37  <Justin_o> cindyli: no problem, ping me when you're ready
2020-10-06T18:49:14  <cindyli> Justin_o: ok, i'm ready
2020-10-06T18:50:57  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2020-10-06T18:51:09  <cindyli> standup room, Justin_o?
2020-10-06T18:57:50  <gmoss> greatislander: fireside chat time in the conf :) we'll see what they have to say
2020-10-06T19:12:52  * greatislander grabs popcorn
2020-10-06T19:13:04  <greatislander> gmoss I forgot to register, will be curious to hear about it!
2020-10-06T19:13:14  <gmoss> it's a very popcorn-worth talk
2020-10-06T19:13:24  <gmoss> you'll see haha... moments of tension for sure
2020-10-06T19:17:36  <gmoss> greatislander: I thought it would be a chat about the ways you can combine Netlify & WP, but it's turned into a Netlify vs. WordPress debate, static vs. dynamic, benchmarking stats, etc.
2020-10-06T19:18:02  <greatislander> hah, I figured it was going to be a showdown
2020-10-06T19:19:11  <gmoss> it is definitely that
2020-10-06T19:19:15  <gmoss> :)
2020-10-06T19:20:55  <Justin_o> greatislander: talks are being posted to https://www.youtube.com/c/JAMstackConf/videos
2020-10-06T19:21:06  <Justin_o> I think it'll be up soon after it's finished
2020-10-06T19:21:33  <Justin_o> The Matts are both looking a bit red
2020-10-06T19:30:36  <greatislander> hahaha
2020-10-06T19:48:52  <gmoss> greatislander: you might get a kick out of this: https://twitter.com/AJSturrock/status/1313564787490553860?s=20
2020-10-06T19:51:38  <gmoss> Justin_o: unrelated, but I'm trying to run all tests in the ST after updating to Node 14, but I can't seem to access the manual tests. I thought I was able to reach them after your SJRK-122 work relocated them, maybe I was mistaken or had been working in a different branch
2020-10-06T19:52:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: If I remember correctly, you'll have to server those up yourself, they aren't served through the storytelling site anymore
2020-10-06T19:54:08  <gmoss> Justin_o: right, I used browser-sync last time. it's coming back to me now :)
2020-10-06T19:54:10  <gmoss> thanks!
2020-10-06T19:54:35  <Justin_o> gmoss: np
2020-10-06T19:55:31  <gmoss> Justin_o: I even missed the new line in the docs: "You'll need to use a webserver to serve the project in order to access the manual tests."
2020-10-06T19:55:47  <Justin_o> haha.. I forgot I added that
2020-10-06T19:55:50  <Justin_o> to the docs
2020-10-06T20:48:14  <gmoss> greatislander: this talk is great so far, relevant to our discussion about BackstopJS last month: https://youtu.be/spyKZ-p3UgE
2020-10-06T21:01:09  <gmoss> cindyli gtirloni: I've updated the ST to Node 14.13.0, everything seems to be okay! I didn't poke through my email archives, but I think there were previously some issues with Node 12 and either Infusion or Kettle, but there don't seem to be any issues now.
2020-10-06T21:01:09  <gmoss> I've opened a PR, it would be great to have some more eyes on it: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/96
2020-10-06T21:01:30  <gmoss> (also updated my dev env :))
2020-10-06T21:06:00  <gtirloni> awesome!!
2020-10-06T21:07:48  <gmoss> gtirloni: something funky seems to be happening with the docker image build step. Did I miss something? https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/actions/runs/292193886
2020-10-06T21:10:52  <gtirloni> ah internal errors are weird.. I just re-ran the jobs and it seems to be building now
2020-10-06T21:11:07  <gmoss> gtirloni: yeah I saw it start up again, figured you were in there :)
2020-10-06T21:11:17  <gmoss> looks like it worked. I wonder what happened
2020-10-06T21:13:31  <gtirloni> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-10-06T21:16:13  <gmoss> also looks like the browser tests are hanging for macOS/Node 12.x :(
2020-10-06T21:19:42  <gtirloni> looks like there's an incident going on
2020-10-06T21:19:45  <gtirloni> https://www.githubstatus.com/
2020-10-06T21:21:48  <gmoss> thanks! glad to know it might not be my fault haha
2020-10-06T21:22:55  <gtirloni> :)
