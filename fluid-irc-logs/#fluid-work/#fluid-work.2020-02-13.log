2020-02-13T12:28:07  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - would you be able to look at a small pull I made for the-t-in-rtf? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/978
2020-02-13T12:28:14  <Bosmon> I realise I owe you some review too :)
2020-02-13T12:34:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, I can take a look at that
2020-02-13T13:11:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: merged your PR into master
2020-02-13T13:11:23  <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks so much!
2020-02-13T13:20:28  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - here is an "old-fashioned" release for you including the fix: 3.0.0-dev.20200213T130945Z.c3c22dc4c
2020-02-13T13:20:48  <the-t-in-rtf> cheers
2020-02-13T13:24:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this reminds me of something that greatislander brought up the other day. In looking at our dev releases it's confusing to 1) know what changed in between dev releases 2) because dev releases can originate from master or from a fork, there is further confusion because of a potential lack of continuity i.e. a later dev release may have older work than a previous dev release. All dev releases use the "dev"
2020-02-13T13:24:43  <Justin_o> tag, although it doesn't seem that NPM actually does anything with them anyways. https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag

2020-02-13T13:36:13  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], did you work on the "mute" button in the QSS?
2020-02-13T13:36:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because we found a bug and I wanted to see if it's been reported.
2020-02-13T13:36:36  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if. you mute and then "reset to standard", the mute doesn't get cleared
2020-02-13T13:38:17  <the-t-in-rtf> this happens in production

2020-02-13T13:53:37  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: volume/mute is not a setting per se
2020-02-13T13:53:57  <jhernandez> it's a command we send to the system
2020-02-13T13:55:16  <jhernandez> so it's not being treated as a setting such as high contrast or the like
2020-02-13T13:55:41  <jhernandez> so, reset-to-std won't affect it
2020-02-13T13:56:09  <jhernandez> not sure if at some point Gregg wanted it to reset when reset-to-std is triggered
2020-02-13T13:57:12  <the-t-in-rtf> is there any other non-setting like this on the QSS?
2020-02-13T13:57:26  <the-t-in-rtf> something that doesn't get saved or reset.
2020-02-13T13:57:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess the volume as well?
2020-02-13T13:58:12  <jhernandez> volume/mute and zoom top window

2020-02-13T14:21:37  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: btw, I remember suggesting that we should tell the users that volume/mute is not a setting in the same way we do for zoom top window
2020-02-13T14:22:01  <the-t-in-rtf> that would be very nice
2020-02-13T14:22:03  <jhernandez> but not sure whether that was taken into consideration
2020-02-13T14:22:51  <the-t-in-rtf> uh, how do we tell users that zoom top window is also not a setting?

2020-02-13T18:23:08  <sgithens> that makes sense with the behavior I'm seeing.  Do we have a list of what we're setting it to for the different deployments right now?

2020-02-13T18:24:36  <sgithens> I've been testing the capture tool with it null, so anything can get captured and saved, but I'm realizing in Bern's case studies only part of them may be able to get captured
2020-02-13T18:24:42  <sgithens> need to test that
2020-02-13T18:26:57  <cindyli> sgithens: the "null" use case is to continue to support the old use case of using the non-NOVA client credential to save preferences. let me know if you find potential problems
2020-02-13T18:29:47  <sgithens> Hmm.  Every single machine that runs morphic and needs to save settings to the cloud needs to have some sort of client credential, and a corresponding one in the cloud correct? Or is there a "default" one that handles any other machine coming in from the outside world?
2020-02-13T18:30:45  <sgithens> although I'm noticing that in my local `gpii-app` with `npm run dev` I can save settings ok, and I'm not sure how it's secret is configured, especially since it's not starting up a windows service
2020-02-13T18:31:19  <sgithens> at least `get-service` in powershell doens't seem to list one
2020-02-13T18:34:24  <cindyli> sgithens: there's always this public client credential to be used - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/clientCredentials/pilot.json
2020-02-13T18:35:08  <cindyli> it's used for previous deployments before NOVA
2020-02-13T18:35:27  <sgithens> cindyli: And whatever operates the pspchannel and saving uses that if no other secrets files are available
2020-02-13T18:36:04  <cindyli> i don't think so, the universal core doesn't do any fall back on client credential
2020-02-13T18:36:35  <cindyli> i mean for windows auto key in installations
2020-02-13T18:44:34  <jhernandez> right
2020-02-13T18:45:21  <jhernandez> so, the sites credentials are only meant to control who and how can populate the gpiiKey/prefsSafes pair in the cloud
2020-02-13T18:46:44  <jhernandez> if you manually key-in (with a uuid that you generate) by any other means that the windows auto-key-in, you shouldn't be able to populate such uuid in the cloud
2020-02-13T18:46:49  <jhernandez> and

2020-02-13T18:52:34  <sgithens> jhernandez: thanks! So, when Bern gets a morphic build from you, and tests it against the production cloud, I"m a guessing he's doing it with one of the client credentials that has this limited amount of `allowedPrefsToWrite` settings?
2020-02-13T18:53:12  <jhernandez> right
2020-02-13T18:54:16  <jhernandez> so that's why I suggested the other day in the email, that maybe we will need to deploy a dev cluster for the use cases study

2020-02-13T18:55:33  <jhernandez> another option would be to update umd's client credentials to allow any of the solutions that are going to be tested along with the capture tool
2020-02-13T18:55:36  <jhernandez> makes sense?
2020-02-13T18:55:46  <sgithens> well I think he actually wants to capture settings for use with their morphic accounts.. if we needed to, could we create a client credential just for case study captures
2020-02-13T18:55:56  <jhernandez> right
2020-02-13T18:56:15  <jhernandez> that's another (and great) alternative
2020-02-13T18:56:21  <jhernandez> so
2020-02-13T18:56:32  <jhernandez> we also have the "testers credentials"
2020-02-13T18:56:55  <jhernandez> but, I think that it could be a good idea to create such credentials for the case studies
2020-02-13T18:56:56  <sgithens> are the testers credentials wide open with no limitations
2020-02-13T18:57:06  <jhernandez> sgithens: nope, exactly the same as the others
2020-02-13T18:57:15  <jhernandez> (as the other pilot sites, I mean)
2020-02-13T18:57:27  <sgithens> they would need to be very limited, since I'm not sure we are certain of all the validation and issuews with everything else in the solutions registry
2020-02-13T18:57:36  <jhernandez> yup
2020-02-13T18:57:43  <sgithens> and security issues with just capturing everything
2020-02-13T18:58:21  <jhernandez> so, we can revoke the credentials for the case study any time
2020-02-13T18:58:31  <sgithens> oh yeah that's right
2020-02-13T18:58:42  <sgithens> so as soon as he's done testing with them
2020-02-13T18:58:47  <sgithens> it could be switched off
2020-02-13T18:59:13  <jhernandez> right, and won't be valid anymore - people can't use them anymore to auto-populate gpiiKeys in our shiny cloud
2020-02-13T18:59:15  <jhernandez> :)
2020-02-13T18:59:25  <jhernandez> would that work ?
2020-02-13T19:01:24  <sgithens> I think so, let me run this past Bern.  I think making a separate client credential for the capture tool makes sense, since he will want to capture much more than just these settings.  Although I'm not even sure if they should be allowed in to their real accounts since they haven't been super thorooughly tested with actual morphic usage
2020-02-13T19:01:41  <sgithens> but I guess maybe soem of that testing can happen in the next few weeks
2020-02-13T19:01:54  <sgithens> I'm not sure yet
2020-02-13T19:02:15  <jhernandez> right
2020-02-13T19:03:07  <jhernandez> so, my fear with the capture tool is that we start capturing things and then we get into troubles - validation issues, or, solutions that just don't work well, etc
2020-02-13T19:03:26  <jhernandez> exploding stuff, you know
2020-02-13T19:03:31  <jhernandez> :P
2020-02-13T19:03:40  <sgithens> yeah, we might still want to restrict teh solutions, but at least add af ew more they are interested in
2020-02-13T19:04:03  <sgithens> I'm definately aware of this... since just running the capture tool will often explode the settings handlers
2020-02-13T19:04:14  <sgithens> since it's trying out every single one we have
2020-02-13T19:04:25  <sgithens> that the device reporter reports as installed
2020-02-13T19:04:46  <jhernandez> yup
2020-02-13T19:04:54  <sgithens> but I will see if maybe we can restrict the number of solutions and just configure the capture tool with those
2020-02-13T19:05:08  <sgithens> but I know we will want to throw in a few more like JAWS or something
2020-02-13T19:05:23  <jhernandez> well, we can always "ban" some solutions from being reported as installed
2020-02-13T19:05:31  <jhernandez> :P

2020-02-13T19:05:34  <sgithens> hahahahahahah
2020-02-13T19:05:37  <jhernandez> (in the worst case, I mean)
2020-02-13T19:06:00  <sgithens> it's not too hard to limit the ones captures
2020-02-13T19:06:05  <jhernandez> ok ok
2020-02-13T19:06:23  <sgithens> I used to have a screen in the workflow where you selected the installed solutions you wanted captured
2020-02-13T19:06:25  <jhernandez> I wasn't sure how difficult would be on your side, that's why I suggested that
2020-02-13T19:06:43  <sgithens> and that array is still around, we just took the screen off because everyone just kept them all selected
2020-02-13T19:07:20  <sgithens> the screen is there too hidden, since I'm sure UX will want it again someday
2020-02-13T19:08:22  <jhernandez> right, if you take a kid to a candy store and you say him "you can take one or two candies, but you can also take everything you want ..." - what do you think the kid would do? :P
