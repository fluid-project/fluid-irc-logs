2020-01-16T20:13:27  <gmoss> Bosmon is tagged in it
2020-01-16T20:13:58  <gmoss> the_t_in_rtf may also be interested in it since he's the one who filed KETTLE-61
2020-01-16T20:14:35  <gmoss> *the-t-in-rtf
2020-01-16T20:17:15  <gmoss> cindyli: considering the SJRK-255 PR is merging into a new "re-review" branch, should we consider merging it from there into master? then we can treat master the way we currently treat stories-floe-dev. what do you think?
2020-01-16T20:17:31  <gmoss> michelled: do you have thoughts on that? ^
2020-01-16T20:17:55  <gmoss> it seems odd to have master just sitting empty like that
2020-01-16T20:20:11  <michelled> gmoss: what is the re-review branch?
2020-01-16T20:20:46  <gmoss> michelled: it's a branch that Bosmon created for the purposes of his review, as far as I can tell
2020-01-16T20:20:58  <gmoss> I'm not 100% sure what designs he might have for it
2020-01-16T20:21:27  <gmoss> my guess is to be able to do a holistic review in order to find the race condition for SJRK-255
2020-01-16T20:22:11  <michelled> does this mean that the branch hasn't passed review right now?
2020-01-16T20:24:54  <gmoss> michelled: It's been given a fairly thorough review, though I had asked Bosmon last week to take another look (to which he agreed) and cindyli was going to give it another glance before okaying the merge iirc. So I think the answer to your question is yes, but I'm not 100% sure I understand your question. It would be prudent to hold off merging right now, but I'm trying to think ahead about what happens to the work
2020-01-16T20:24:54  <gmoss> once it's merged into "re-review". does it go into stories-floe-dev only? or master? both?
2020-01-16T20:25:57  <cindyli> i think it's a good idea to merge things into the master that will replace stories-floe-dev branch
2020-01-16T20:27:00  <cindyli> i didn't realize there's a "re-review" branch.
2020-01-16T20:27:03  <michelled> I can't remember what stories-floe-dev is - is it going away?
2020-01-16T20:31:09  <gmoss> michelled: it only goes away if we decide it should. it is effectively our master branch, though I know we were holding off merging into master until the codebase met our fluid-project standards (there's a Jira to make those more flexible). At this point, however, I feel we may as well just use master instead of a proxy branch. right now the only other thing it is used for is as the basis for the FLOE Staging version
2020-01-16T20:31:09  <gmoss> of the Storytelling Tool
2020-01-16T20:31:15  <gmoss> but that's easily reconfigured
2020-01-16T20:32:08  <gmoss> i.e. CI will build the staging site directly from that branch whenever a commit is made
2020-01-16T20:32:53  <michelled> seems reasonable to me to switch to master and get rid of the dev branch - cindyli do you agree?
2020-01-16T20:33:40  <michelled> but going back to your original question - I think we need to know what the re-review branch is before we know if it should be merged here
2020-01-16T20:33:47  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-01-16T20:35:36  <gmoss> michelled: it does seem prudent to wait and find out more about the intentions for that branch
2020-01-16T20:35:41  <gmoss> *re-review
2020-01-16T20:36:28  <cindyli> gmoss, michelled: ya, a good idea to get rid of the dev branch. we might also add a section in the master README to explain what other branches are for
2020-01-16T20:37:16  <gmoss> cindyli: that's a good idea. I think I'll create another Jira to "migrate" from stories-floe-dev to master and include this README requirement
2020-01-16T20:37:26  <gmoss> so we can deal with that issue separately from the SJRK-255 PR
2020-01-16T20:37:30  <cindyli> +1
2020-01-16T20:37:43  <michelled> sounds good
2020-01-16T20:37:56  <gmoss> I'm also trying to plan which branch my SJRK-104 work will be based on
2020-01-16T20:38:35  <gmoss> I might just branch directly off my SJRK-255 if you think that's okay in this case. I believe Bosmon is away for another few days
2020-01-16T20:39:21  <michelled> that seems reasonable to me - there's so much change in that branch
2020-01-16T20:39:27  <cindyli> agree
2020-01-16T20:39:37  <gmoss> michelled cindyli: awesome. Thanks for your feedback! :)

2020-01-16T22:00:43  <gmoss> Justin_o: have you implemented the cancellable promises changes, yet? I updated the Storytelling Tool to the latest version of infusion (3.0.0-dev.20191220T163226Z.db83ce0ef.FLUID-6145) and found that it broke my Node server tests, not sure what changes I'd need to make yet
2020-01-16T22:00:55  <gmoss> in the meantime I've reverted back to 3.0.0-dev.20191219T155607Z.32876d29c.FLUID-6145
