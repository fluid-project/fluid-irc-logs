2019-04-04T15:40:14  <Bosmon> Hi there javjarfer[m]
2019-04-04T15:48:46  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon
2019-04-04T15:49:24  <javjarfer[m]> I wanted to ask you about a behavior I saw yesterday while working into reported issues
2019-04-04T15:49:56  <javjarfer[m]> so, Morphic entered into a constant booting loop apparently because another application was taking the same port
2019-04-04T15:50:39  <javjarfer[m]> I think that isn't the desirable behavior, and that if the application can't start in the proper port, shouldn't be trying to boot itself again and again
2019-04-04T15:53:18  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: of course
2019-04-04T15:53:54  <jhernandez> I guess that there should be some kind of timeout when the service tries to start morphic
2019-04-04T15:54:36  <jhernandez> but, can you determine why it is not starting in your case?

2019-04-04T19:50:02  <simonjb> thanks alanharnum, and the deploy branch is then published on a webserver that we manage? (rather than github pages)
2019-04-04T19:50:42  <alanharnum> simonjb: yes, it's moved to the static web server - it's been that way for a while now.
2019-04-04T19:50:49  <simonjb> cool
2019-04-04T19:51:36  <alanharnum> what the ghpages plugin was doing was basically committing and pushing the contents of the out directory to the deploy branch of the origin repo
2019-04-04T19:51:50  <alanharnum> CI then picks up that change to the branch and deploys it to our server
2019-04-04T19:52:06  <simonjb> got it, thanks
