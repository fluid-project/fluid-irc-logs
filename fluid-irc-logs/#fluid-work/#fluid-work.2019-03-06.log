2019-03-06T11:31:19  <Bosmon> Hay there stegru
2019-03-06T11:31:23  <Bosmon> How's it looking today?
2019-03-06T11:31:40  <stegru> hello, all right.. you?
2019-03-06T11:33:38  <Bosmon> not bad : P
2019-03-06T11:34:18  <Bosmon> What's on your plate for the rest of the week?
2019-03-06T11:34:46  <stegru> finishing the access requester thing
2019-03-06T11:35:28  <stegru> I've done the linkage from core to the service so far
2019-03-06T11:35:55  <Bosmon> Awesome
2019-03-06T11:36:14  <Bosmon> So is it going to work the way that the core makes an API call with an "HTTP request template" and it gets back a promise for the response?
2019-03-06T11:36:40  <stegru> well, that's what I'm deciding now
2019-03-06T11:36:54  <Bosmon> ok
2019-03-06T11:37:02  <Bosmon> If it saves time we can easily just have it hand the secret back
2019-03-06T11:37:22  <stegru> yes, I think it would do
2019-03-06T11:37:54  <stegru> I'm against letting the secret out of the service - but, there's probably more things to worry about than someone reading the process memory
2019-03-06T11:39:38  <stegru> my suggestion would be in future just to not support SSO without some type of per-user storage
2019-03-06T11:43:59  <Bosmon> Yes
2019-03-06T11:45:10  <Bosmon> Gregg was pretty hopping yesterday that we are up against the deployment deadline, so we had better take whatever shortcuts we can for now to an at least slightly secure and stable product
2019-03-06T11:45:23  <Bosmon> If we can get this out the door, we'll have over the summer to iterate on something better

2019-03-06T13:53:43  <stegru> morning cindyli - for now, I'm just going to make the service return the secret, rather than make the request.. so, would this be where the secret is injected:
2019-03-06T13:53:45  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/accessRequester/src/accessRequester.js#L75
2019-03-06T13:54:12  <stegru> (not urgent, if you're still waking up)
2019-03-06T13:58:34  <cindyli> the line above, line 74, the variable "clientCredential" is where the secret is stored, stegru
2019-03-06T13:59:07  <stegru> clientCredential is the secret?

2019-03-06T14:02:20  <stegru> cindyli
2019-03-06T14:08:48  <stegru> Bosmon jhernandez, I'll be keeping the authentication it in the same branch as the existing service PR (unless there's any problem with that)
2019-03-06T14:09:05  <jhernandez> stegru: it's fine
2019-03-06T14:11:00  <jhernandez> unless we think that is better to merge the service first and then provide another pr for the auth thing
2019-03-06T14:11:10  <Bosmon> No, let's do it all at once
2019-03-06T14:11:23  <jhernandez> yeah, I agree with that
2019-03-06T14:11:48  <jhernandez> having everything in the same branch doesn't hurt
2019-03-06T14:12:03  <jhernandez> I was telling just in case
2019-03-06T14:16:07  <stegru> if the auth turns out to be a dog's dinner, you could just the commit as of now
2019-03-06T14:17:30  <Bosmon> Well, we can't roll out without at least some bog-level auth, and the auth is the main value of having the service at all
2019-03-06T14:19:25  <stegru> haha yes of course
2019-03-06T14:21:10  <Bosmon> jhernandez, cindyli, the-t-in-rtf - shall we think about https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/93 ?
2019-03-06T14:21:36  <Bosmon> I think we are clear that the config we inherit from in tests/configs/gpii.tests.all.config.json5 is "wrong"
2019-03-06T14:21:54  <Bosmon> The first question is - do we know what the right config to inherit from is - or, that it even exists?
2019-03-06T14:22:30  <Bosmon> Based on my comment here - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/93#issuecomment-469221812 - it seems likely that we might need to break up this config in universal called "production"
2019-03-06T14:22:43  <Bosmon> Since it couples together a few things that might not always go together
2019-03-06T14:23:00  <Bosmon> I think the general assumption until now is that "any config used by gpii-app should be called/considered 'production'"
2019-03-06T14:23:30  <jhernandez> yes
2019-03-06T14:23:38  <Bosmon> But I think there are some problems with this view - the most concrete of which is the idea that many people will do manual testing of the app using the HTTP endpoints which have now been removed
2019-03-06T14:23:55  <Bosmon> But there are no doubt some other problems : P
2019-03-06T14:23:57  <jhernandez> so, in terms of supressing the http endpoints
2019-03-06T14:24:40  <jhernandez> I received explicit orders from Gregg that any installers that are coming out of core shouldn't include any dev-related stuff
2019-03-06T14:25:44  <jhernandez> it's a long story, but I only create this kind of installers either for us or Kavya, that's all
2019-03-06T14:25:45  <cindyli> so, suppressing will be and only be applied to production configs, while resetting all will be applied to both dev and production configs
2019-03-06T14:26:30  <jhernandez> but I do agree with your point, that the configs must be flexible enough
2019-03-06T14:26:37  <jhernandez> and of course, that they make sense
2019-03-06T14:26:41  <jhernandez> :P
2019-03-06T14:26:48  <cindyli> i can split these two cases into 2 base config files

2019-03-06T14:30:25  <jhernandez> I can update the gpii-app configs according to our needs but first, as Bosmon said, we need to figure out the configs that gpii-app should use and if they exist
2019-03-06T14:32:10  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@192.0.159.124> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-06T14:37:22  <cindyli> jhernandez, Bosmon, i'm not clear why using manualTesting config causes "client credential not found" error. If this is the only config gpii-app tests use, wouldn't CouchDB be loaded with a full set of data at the start and be used till the end.
2019-03-06T14:37:43  <Bosmon> cindyli - the issue is that gpii-app tests run both acceptance tests and its own internal tests
2019-03-06T14:38:21  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/tests.js#L44
2019-03-06T14:38:24  <Bosmon> This is what it runs
2019-03-06T14:41:01  <jhernandez> but it runs the apptests first, and then the windows acceptance ones
2019-03-06T14:41:11  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/package.json#L44
2019-03-06T14:41:24  <Bosmon> Yes, this is odd
2019-03-06T14:41:52  <jhernandez> that's why I wasn't sure why manualTesting wasn't the right config to use
2019-03-06T14:42:35  <cindyli> probably the log can tell which one runs first indeed
2019-03-06T14:42:47  <Bosmon> I'm getting pretty puzzled reading these logs because it seems that some tests run twice
2019-03-06T14:43:08  <Bosmon> I see two lots of these: jq: Test concluded - Module "GPII Preferences Parsing Tests" Test name "Parse key out message": 4/4 passed - PASS
2019-03-06T14:44:44  <Bosmon> I can't even really understand what test is running at the point of failure
2019-03-06T14:45:53  <Bosmon> Well, somehow it does seem from this run as if the entire test run has run twice - https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/534/console
2019-03-06T14:46:11  <Bosmon> There is one of these at the top: > gpii-app@1.0.1 test:psp C:\vagrant
2019-03-06T14:46:11  <Bosmon> > set GPII_TEST_COUCH_USE_EXTERNAL=TRUE && electron ./instrumented/tests.js
2019-03-06T14:46:56  <Bosmon> And then there is another one - is this perhaps some vagrant thing that is just retrying the test run because it timed out?
2019-03-06T14:47:04  <Bosmon> There is a 2nd invocation of do.ps1 -c 'npm test'
2019-03-06T14:47:06  <Bosmon> Halfway down
2019-03-06T14:49:35  <cindyli> searching "testsGpiiWindows.js" in the log shows no result. It never reached the point to run windows acceptance tests
2019-03-06T14:49:51  <Bosmon> cindyli - to me it looks like it has failed when running its own integration tests
2019-03-06T14:49:59  <cindyli> exactly
2019-03-06T14:50:07  <Bosmon> jhernandez - "manualTesting" will never be the right form of config for any kind of automated test
2019-03-06T14:50:14  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf 's improved naming has made this clear to us all now : P
2019-03-06T14:50:35  <jhernandez> well, yeah, that's true
2019-03-06T14:51:01  <the-t-in-rtf> IMO we should only ever have test configs elsewhere as well
2019-03-06T14:51:16  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if you were reusing one straight up, you should be reusing it from tests/configs
2019-03-06T14:51:24  <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps reusing bits from gpii/configs/shared
2019-03-06T14:51:46  <the-t-in-rtf> we should not store the blanks next to the live ammo for various reasons.
2019-03-06T14:52:05  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - it's suddenly striking me that the GPII app's entire integration testing system may no longer be valid/compatible with what we have in core - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L53
2019-03-06T14:52:38  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that is way out of date.
2019-03-06T14:53:09  <the-t-in-rtf> but it has its own awful sequence munger
2019-03-06T14:53:19  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L117
2019-03-06T14:53:21  <jhernandez> but, in terms of the config that gpii-app tests needs to use, I guess that it just needs the gpii up & running so they can perform key-ins/outs against it
2019-03-06T14:53:24  <jhernandez> right?
2019-03-06T14:53:56  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, it needs the same one that is used by Windows Acceptance Tests
2019-03-06T14:53:59  <Bosmon> Whatever that is
2019-03-06T14:54:04  <Bosmon> That will solve our problem to 1st order
2019-03-06T14:54:10  <jhernandez> ok
2019-03-06T14:54:16  <jhernandez> and that is ...
2019-03-06T14:54:19  <Bosmon> The one that clears out the database and reinitialises it to one that just contains the snapsets
2019-03-06T14:55:55  <Bosmon> So it looks like the current most basic integration tests bind against this one - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/configs/gpii.tests.production.config.json5
2019-03-06T14:56:15  <Bosmon> Which indeed then binds against gpii.tests.all.config.json5 , the one you then bound to manualTesting
2019-03-06T14:57:58  <Bosmon> jhernandez - so the windows acceptance tests builtins bind here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L1713
2019-03-06T14:58:01  <Bosmon> So let's follow this up the tree
2019-03-06T14:58:38  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/configs/gpii.tests.acceptance.windows.builtIn.config.json
2019-03-06T14:58:54  <Bosmon> Looks like the first BIG CONFIG it hits is gpii.config.development.local.json5
2019-03-06T14:59:52  <Bosmon> Which is a little odd because it is not "untrusted"
2019-03-06T15:00:04  <jhernandez> sorry - jumped into a call with Gregg

2019-03-06T17:04:27  <the-t-in-rtf> are we not in room 2?
2019-03-06T17:04:33  <the-t-in-rtf> dang it!

2019-03-06T17:05:14  <the-t-in-rtf> but if room 3 is empty, can we move back
2019-03-06T17:05:15  <the-t-in-rtf> so comfy
2019-03-06T17:05:32  <jhernandez> Bosmon: stegru ?

2019-03-06T17:56:13  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, @javjarfer[m] or @bosmon
2019-03-06T17:56:14  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6948
2019-03-06T17:56:19  <the-t-in-rtf> Is that really what that setting means?
2019-03-06T17:56:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the "active z order" label seems very different
2019-03-06T17:56:51  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, they mean the z order is the focus, i.e. on top
2019-03-06T17:58:13  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, your last guess is correct
2019-03-06T17:59:04  <jhernandez> Bosmon: I'm puzzled - how is that the windows acceptance tests are passing by using the gpii.tests.acceptance.windows.builtIn.config ?
2019-03-06T17:59:57  <Bosmon> Well jhernandez - thank you for your question : P
2019-03-06T18:01:30  <jhernandez> ???
2019-03-06T18:01:48  <cindyli> jhernandez: that config uses gpii.config.development.local.json5 which is an all-in-local config
2019-03-06T18:02:08  <cindyli> it starts both cloud and local flow managers with static device reporter
2019-03-06T18:02:25  <Bosmon> Here is the relevant config - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/shared/gpii.config.development.local.json5
2019-03-06T18:02:27  <cindyli> in terms of the backend couchdb, couch db test harness takes care of that
2019-03-06T18:02:38  <Bosmon> I guess we should review whether this file comment is now accurate
2019-03-06T18:02:50  <Bosmon> It says "It doesn't start any backend database for data persistence." which I believe is now false
2019-03-06T18:02:53  *** lliskovoi_ <lliskovoi_!~lliskovoi@205.211.168.104> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-06T18:04:14  <Bosmon> But I do wonder
2019-03-06T18:04:18  <cindyli> it does, which i feel it's wrong - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/shared/gpii.config.development.base.local.json5#L32
2019-03-06T18:04:23  <Bosmon> So all the "manualTesting" configs inherit through this one - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/shared/gpii.config.couch.development.base.json5
2019-03-06T18:04:30  <Bosmon> Which includes the description of all these databases
2019-03-06T18:04:48  <Bosmon> But surely we also require these databases to be present using gpii.config.development.local too?
2019-03-06T18:04:56  <Bosmon> So I am completely confused, just like jhernandez
2019-03-06T18:05:28  <Bosmon> Where do all the databases come from, if we do not have a "gpii.test.couchdb.harness.persistent"
2019-03-06T18:05:38  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf, your observations welcome too : P
2019-03-06T18:06:17  <jhernandez> I mean, I've been going back and forth into this between calls, skype, etc ... and I'm more confused

2019-03-06T18:07:20  <jhernandez> don't worry
2019-03-06T18:08:19  <jhernandez> my last test was, "okay, let's remove the gpii db manually and start the system with gpii.tests.acceptance.windows.builtIn.config"
2019-03-06T18:08:29  <jhernandez> and the db is NOT being created
2019-03-06T18:08:31  <jhernandez> as expected
2019-03-06T18:08:33  <jhernandez> okay
2019-03-06T18:08:35  <jhernandez> BUT
2019-03-06T18:09:06  <jhernandez> why do they pass CI on windows?
2019-03-06T18:09:09  <cindyli> jhernandez, Bosmon: the database and its data for running tests should come from https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Fixtures.js#L183-L199

2019-03-06T18:52:26  <Bosmon> I wonder why the list in Fixtures.js is different from the list in https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/shared/gpii.config.couch.development.base.json5
2019-03-06T18:52:38  <Bosmon> At the very least, we should add a comment mutually referring between these two sites

2019-03-06T18:55:44  <cindyli> yes, i agree a comment is needed. the list in Fixtures.js contain much more test data while the one in the gpii.config.couch.development.base.json5 is to simulate a cleaner production environment
