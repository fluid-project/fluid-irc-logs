2019-05-02T11:29:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm a little concerned that Antranig doesn't seem to be around
2019-05-02T11:29:53  <sgithens> yeah
2019-05-02T11:30:10  <sgithens> even if he's not around... it's odd that zero of his machines are logged on to IRC
2019-05-02T11:31:14  <cindyli> very odd
2019-05-02T11:32:36  <sgithens> Hi Cindy!
2019-05-02T11:32:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I pinged him on IM
2019-05-02T11:32:55  <cindyli> hey GITHENS
2019-05-02T11:32:56  <sgithens> not sure if you were on the channel for the link: https://pad.gpii.net/p/data-model-migrations-for-gpii-schemas-zb154n6e
2019-05-02T11:33:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I have ideas about a lot of them, but I'd rather not race to far ahead without Ant
2019-05-02T11:33:41  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a shame as we bumped to get this time
2019-05-02T11:33:43  <cindyli> looks great, thanks
2019-05-02T11:33:46  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, give it a few minutes?
2019-05-02T11:34:01  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i heard either you or Alan are working on making the docpad work with the new node version?
2019-05-02T11:34:29  <cindyli> are you working on it? is this work included in your pull request that adds search component for infusion-docs?
2019-05-02T11:34:47  <the-t-in-rtf> my pull includes work to pin the docpad version to something old enough
2019-05-02T11:34:57  <the-t-in-rtf> the only problems I was aware of were in using newer versions of docpad
2019-05-02T11:35:22  <the-t-in-rtf> that may imply compatibility only with a particular version of node, but I've been testing my pull with node@10 with no problems
2019-05-02T11:36:46  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: ah, so older versions of docpad work fine with node 10 but not newer versions
2019-05-02T11:37:03  <cindyli> that's odd
2019-05-02T11:37:40  <the-t-in-rtf> no idea, I was responding to the problems with running newer globally installed docpads
2019-05-02T11:37:53  <the-t-in-rtf> so using our config with a newer docpad will definitely blow up
2019-05-02T11:38:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I hadn't heard anything at all about node versions being a problem
2019-05-02T11:38:17  <cindyli> i see.
2019-05-02T11:38:18  <the-t-in-rtf> so maybe the problem was mischaracterised at some point
2019-05-02T11:39:35  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: How is the your new search engine work going?   Is there a particular repo for it already?
2019-05-02T11:39:48  <the-t-in-rtf> there's a pull
2019-05-02T11:39:51  <sgithens> I think I was switching audio during your update yesterday
2019-05-02T11:40:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I finished the tests this morning, just adding a "mini" search from every page's sidebar
2019-05-02T11:40:53  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: ok it is part of infusion-docs
2019-05-02T11:41:30  <sgithens> I thought you might be building some other standalone thing from previous discussions. I think maybe from the comments that people weren't super worried about it being docpad specific
2019-05-02T11:41:32  <sgithens> that's awesome
2019-05-02T11:42:25  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I just fixed the other problem because I already had an incompatible version of docpad and I'm nice like that
2019-05-02T11:42:40  <sgithens> :)
2019-05-02T11:42:44  <the-t-in-rtf> and my approach is not specific at all to docpad
2019-05-02T11:42:59  <sgithens> What did you like about fuze  compared to like lunr.js?
2019-05-02T11:43:16  <the-t-in-rtf> did you read the technical review?
2019-05-02T11:43:18  <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2019-05-02T11:43:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, neither are terribly well documented, Fuse.js performed better for what we needed.
2019-05-02T11:44:16  <sgithens> sorry, I didn't. I'll go look it up
2019-05-02T11:44:19  <the-t-in-rtf> it's cool
2019-05-02T11:44:25  <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2019-05-02T11:44:50  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/147
2019-05-02T11:45:02  <the-t-in-rtf> that links to the ticket, which links to the technical review
2019-05-02T11:45:43  <sgithens> thanks!
2019-05-02T11:45:47  <the-t-in-rtf> So, even with a cached index, lunr.js was slower, is the point
2019-05-02T11:46:12  <the-t-in-rtf> the stuff I ended up with typically searches in 75ms or less.
2019-05-02T11:46:26  <the-t-in-rtf> where lunr.js took nearly 400ms to load its index
2019-05-02T11:46:44  <sgithens> huh
2019-05-02T11:47:03  <sgithens> and there wasn't anything major feature wise you were missign out on
2019-05-02T11:47:28  <the-t-in-rtf> no, sadly neither of them have decent phrase handling or handling for "must have" (+) and "can't have" (-)
2019-05-02T11:47:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I wrote up my ideas on adding that
2019-05-02T11:47:48  <the-t-in-rtf> but otherwise they are comparable
2019-05-02T11:48:01  <the-t-in-rtf> I thought lunr.js would be the winner because of the index caching  until I actually tested the speed
2019-05-02T11:48:14  <the-t-in-rtf> fuse.js indexes our whole docs site in less than 1ms, typically
2019-05-02T11:48:29  <the-t-in-rtf> so even if it's search is slower, it has a big lead already
2019-05-02T11:48:49  <sgithens> is that on a different write-up or is it in this page as well? (the phrase handling ideas)
2019-05-02T11:48:57  <the-t-in-rtf> it's linked to the pull
2019-05-02T11:49:12  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6378
2019-05-02T11:49:17  <the-t-in-rtf> just to save you hunting around
2019-05-02T11:49:47  <the-t-in-rtf> it may be that that ticket is a good reason to switch to lunr.js
2019-05-02T11:50:00  <the-t-in-rtf> as searching a bunch of times for 3-5ms is better than searching a bunch of times at 75ms
2019-05-02T11:50:33  <the-t-in-rtf> but since my search is a view component with its own abstractions, we can swap out the search engine later without changing much I hope.
2019-05-02T11:51:42  <sgithens> are you pre-building indexes at all for these?
2019-05-02T11:51:53  <sgithens> Since it's a static site, it seems like we could do that
2019-05-02T11:52:04  <sgithens> pegged to a revision number or something
2019-05-02T11:52:16  <the-t-in-rtf> fuse.js doesn't support caching indexes
2019-05-02T11:52:22  <the-t-in-rtf> and it was too slow doing it with lunr.js
2019-05-02T11:52:23  <sgithens> oh right
2019-05-02T11:52:34  <sgithens> huh
2019-05-02T11:52:48  <the-t-in-rtf> but if we went back to lunr.js it'd be easy to extend my digest script to also index it.
2019-05-02T11:53:07  <sgithens> the api's are so simple these days, hopefully it'd be an easy switch
2019-05-02T11:53:21  <the-t-in-rtf> as I did try that out, the node version of lunr.js can index stuff that the browser can use
2019-05-02T11:55:56  <sgithens> I'm gonna hang out for a bit anyways, but do you want to go ahead and reschedule this for Tuesday?
2019-05-02T12:00:40  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-05-02T12:01:38  <the-t-in-rtf> had to bump to thursday
2019-05-02T12:01:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I have a very hard stop about a half hour early
2019-05-02T12:01:58  <the-t-in-rtf> if Ant resurfaces I can also meet tomorrow
2019-05-02T12:02:01  <the-t-in-rtf> or Monday
2019-05-02T12:07:52  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, Antranig says tomorrow is good
2019-05-02T12:08:41  <sgithens> great
2019-05-02T12:08:43  <sgithens> thanks!
2019-05-02T12:09:50  <cindyli> cool
