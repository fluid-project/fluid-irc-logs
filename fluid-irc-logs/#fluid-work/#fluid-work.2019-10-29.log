2019-10-29T14:37:32  <cindyli> stegru: wonder how Windows auto key-in generates GPII keys. is GPII key a combination of "username" + "a unique machine id"?
2019-10-29T14:38:00  <stegru> it's "username" + "a unique site id", cindyli
2019-10-29T14:38:18  <stegru> (or user id, depending on siteconfig)
2019-10-29T14:38:24  <cindyli> ok, so the same NOVA user will always uses the same GPII key
2019-10-29T14:38:36  <cindyli> across all computers in campus
2019-10-29T14:38:39  <stegru> yes
2019-10-29T14:38:45  <cindyli> great. thanks
2019-10-29T14:39:54  <stegru> it's in here: https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/GPII-2338/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/windowsLogin.js
2019-10-29T14:42:34  <cindyli> thanks, stegru. what if a user uses a computer at home? would each home installation have its own unique site id? not sure if this use case has ever been discussed.
2019-10-29T14:46:30  <stegru> that's right, cindyli. I'm not sure if having a unique site-id for each installation is the way to go (maybe they should all have the same one?) - this hasn't been thought about yet
2019-10-29T14:46:53  <cindyli> ok. thanks
2019-10-29T14:47:05  <stegru> if they installed on a new computer, their key would be different
2019-10-29T14:47:31  <cindyli> because the site id would be different?
2019-10-29T14:48:04  <stegru> that's right
2019-10-29T14:48:16  <cindyli> got it. thanks
2019-10-29T14:49:17  <stegru> perhaps they would have a key generated by us... when they first log in using the email/username + password, some sort of token can be stored on their computer

I'm working on SJRK-286 at the moment, though SJRK-255 is next on the docket. I'll let you know and Justin_o know once I get back to it :)

2019-10-29T16:35:05  <Bosmon> gmoss - great, no worries, I assume you just reverted that merge of my work-in-progress update into your branch
2019-10-29T16:36:03  <Bosmon> There's no huge hurry since it will take me a while to finish migrating gpii-app
2019-10-29T16:37:40  <gmoss> Bosmon: I haven't done much to that branch since the merge, actually :) since it's a branch dedicated to that issue, there wasn't any real consequence outside of it. the trick will be reconciling that work with changes to the latest version of the storytelling tool as well as whatever changes you've made for FLUID-6148
2019-10-29T16:39:25  <Bosmon> gmoss - in theory, updating to FLUID-6148 should allow you to eliminate a lot of tedious onResourceLoaded boilerplate junk
2019-10-29T16:39:42  <Bosmon> But we also need to get to a point where we have a harmonised release of gpii-handlebars first
2019-10-29T16:40:05  <Bosmon> But I am still ping-ponging between gpii-app and the FLUID-6148 branch itself, successively fixing issues that it raises
2019-10-29T16:40:18  <Bosmon> So it'll be a little while still before we have a fully stabilised release candidate
2019-10-29T16:41:08  <gmoss> Bosmon: gotcha. should I hold off working on SJRK-255 until such time?
2019-10-29T16:41:48  <gmoss> i.e. would working on it now be superseded by more work later anyway, and would you recommend simply waiting?
2019-10-29T16:42:03  <Bosmon> gmoss - I think any destabilising changes from here on will be pretty minor
2019-10-29T16:42:18  <Bosmon> I don't think I've made a change for several months that broke someone's code that was previously working with the branch
2019-10-29T16:42:36  <Bosmon> So any time you have to devote to looking at it at any point will likely be worthwhile
2019-10-29T16:42:56  <gmoss> Bosmon: okay, great :) thanks!

2019-10-29T19:34:55  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, not at the moment, I think I stopped at adding a warning to the SR tests about settings missing defaults
2019-10-29T19:35:06  <the-t-in-rtf> It's great that you're doing that.
2019-10-29T19:40:47  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Is that in master? Is it a test or report or something I trigger from `npm test xyzed...`?
2019-10-29T19:40:53  <sgithens> the missing defaults thing
2019-10-29T19:41:47  <the-t-in-rtf> ugh
2019-10-29T19:41:50  <the-t-in-rtf> right, it was merged
2019-10-29T19:42:03  <the-t-in-rtf> and then banished to a pocket dimension
2019-10-29T19:42:21  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: right, and so it can't fail the tests otherwise the builds wouldn't be passing
2019-10-29T19:42:44  <sgithens> so it must be a utility right? Maybe it's obvious if I just go back through the solutions markdown docs
2019-10-29T19:42:57  <the-t-in-rtf> It's not really obvious until that branch is back

2019-10-29T19:43:28  <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe it is, I think maybe Ant just neutered the validated endpoints and left the other stuff, just a sec
2019-10-29T19:43:42  <sgithens> oh i see, it happens at runtime
2019-10-29T19:43:46  <sgithens> on endpoints
2019-10-29T19:44:03  <sgithens> I mean, I have my `jq` report which pulls out things without defaults
2019-10-29T19:44:05  <sgithens> although..
2019-10-29T19:44:41  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/solutionsRegistry/test/SolutionsRegistryFileTests.js#L85
2019-10-29T19:44:53  <the-t-in-rtf> looks like I do that for title and description but not defaults.
2019-10-29T19:44:54  <sgithens> it just looks for a `default` property, there are other slightly subtle ways to set a default value in json schema right... none of my stuff really checks for other ways a default is set
2019-10-29T19:45:03  <sgithens> sometimes it appears to be another block of stuff
2019-10-29T19:45:15  <sgithens> ah cool
2019-10-29T19:46:02  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I think we should refrain from using those subtler ways for defaults, like mixing defaults and anyOfs is probably a bad idea.
2019-10-29T19:46:20  <sgithens> like I see this:   {"title":"Desktop background wallpaper","description":"The path to the image to be set as the new desktop wallpaper.","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"value":{"type":"string","default":"%SystemRoot%\\Web\\Wallpaper\\Windows\\img0.jpg"}}}
2019-10-29T19:46:21  <the-t-in-rtf> for your authoring and also for the sanity of anyone reading the schema
2019-10-29T19:46:30  <sgithens> definately, I agree
2019-10-29T19:47:37  <sgithens> like, for that, would it work if default was moved to top level? Or does it have to be in that structure for it to work?
2019-10-29T19:47:41  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's the right level of atomicity as well, i.e. we don't have some insane default as an object higher up
2019-10-29T19:47:53  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, I just answered your question in reverse
2019-10-29T19:48:11  <the-t-in-rtf> leave the defaults as primitives deeper within the structure, I think
2019-10-29T19:48:37  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you shouldn't have a default as an object living at the same level as the properties
2019-10-29T19:49:02  <the-t-in-rtf> { type: "object", default: { foo: "bar"}, properties: { baz: { type: "string"}}{
2019-10-29T19:49:07  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the bad way
2019-10-29T19:49:18  <sgithens> ok, so the one above I pasted is correct
2019-10-29T19:49:19  <the-t-in-rtf> as you can incredibly easily express defaults that would be invalid
2019-10-29T19:49:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-10-29T19:49:35  <the-t-in-rtf> that's in fact why I added the check
2019-10-29T19:49:38  <sgithens> which means we do sort of need to traverse structures and pick out `default` properties
2019-10-29T19:50:12  <the-t-in-rtf> Or you could say that we need to have a way to handle settings as objects
2019-10-29T19:50:15  <sgithens> did you add a canonical global function we can use in universal to do that?  Something I can always call with a schema to get the default value?
2019-10-29T19:50:23  <the-t-in-rtf> not really, no
2019-10-29T19:50:57  <sgithens> I can already imagine all my tools separately traversing this for defaults properties which seems bad
2019-10-29T19:50:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I think my approach would actually fail to check settings that are represented as objects
2019-10-29T19:51:17  <sgithens> we should probably add a central function to grab at least the edge cases we care about
2019-10-29T19:51:26  <the-t-in-rtf> you could argue that we should be trying to represent nearly all settings as primitivewws
2019-10-29T19:51:30  <the-t-in-rtf> primitives, even
2019-10-29T19:51:46  <sgithens> it would make life easier
2019-10-29T19:52:23  <sgithens> but their are some crazy things like screen resolution which seem to make sense as an object
2019-10-29T19:52:38  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-10-29T19:52:47  <sgithens> however that's also the type  of thing that often doesn't have a default value that makes sense
2019-10-29T19:52:52  <the-t-in-rtf> unless you were to have two settings, one for width and one for height
2019-10-29T19:52:53  <sgithens> but some might
2019-10-29T19:53:26  <the-t-in-rtf> but that seems brittle in its own way, like you could end up with 1024x1024 or something bonkers, you want them to be a reasonable pair
2019-10-29T19:53:40  <sgithens> I'm gonna go through this list, I think we probably have like 10 settings in the whole lot were the default is down a level in an object
2019-10-29T19:54:01  <the-t-in-rtf> great, I look forward to hearing what you find when I'm awake again
2019-10-29T19:54:03  <sgithens> if we just handle those I think we'll cover like 98% of our stuff without anything cray
2019-10-29T19:54:08  <sgithens> :)
2019-10-29T19:54:18  <the-t-in-rtf> Yeah, I think just handling defaults in one level of properties is enough
2019-10-29T19:54:31  <the-t-in-rtf> If you find anything deeper it seems like we should refactor
2019-10-29T19:54:49  <the-t-in-rtf> keep that in mind while you look and share anything that seems to need more
2019-10-29T19:54:57  <sgithens> for sure
2019-10-29T19:55:17  <sgithens> thanks for the late night input
2019-10-29T19:55:22  <sgithens> :)
2019-10-29T19:56:05  <the-t-in-rtf> it's not as late as it would have been last week... ;)
2019-10-29T19:56:17  <sgithens> hhaahha, that's right!
2019-10-29T19:56:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I wish we had more overlap, it was my pleasure to talk with you
2019-10-29T19:56:34  <sgithens> I wish we always had this extra hour difference
2019-10-29T19:56:54  <the-t-in-rtf> move to colorado?
2019-10-29T19:58:26  <sgithens> hahahahhahaa
2019-10-29T19:58:46  <sgithens> the air is so dry
2019-10-29T19:58:59  <sgithens> I guess eventually you don't feel desicated all the time
2019-10-29T20:00:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I think so.  I moved to LA after Hawaii, I got nose bleeds from the dry air for a year, and then was fine.

2019-10-29T20:00:53  <sgithens> I didn't know you lived in Hawaii
2019-10-29T20:01:06  <sgithens> or maybe I vaguely remember the story from the old days...
2019-10-29T20:01:23  <sgithens> i saw some old sakai folks at Educause presenting...
2019-10-29T20:01:28  <sgithens> it was kind of wierd
2019-10-29T20:02:02  <the-t-in-rtf> Oahu, the one with Honolulu
2019-10-29T20:02:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I had a work conversation years later with a colleague who was like, "oh, that's interesting, my mechanic grew up in Hawaii"
2019-10-29T20:02:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm like "that's my brother" (it was)
2019-10-29T20:03:07  <sgithens> OMG
2019-10-29T20:03:10  <sgithens> that's awesome
2019-10-29T20:03:47  <sgithens> you got that sweet xbox a11y controller right?
2019-10-29T20:03:52  <sgithens> is it cool?
2019-10-29T20:04:20  <the-t-in-rtf> It is, and I was just dusting it off for a new project.
2019-10-29T20:04:37  <the-t-in-rtf> What's great is that you can use nearly any kind of switch for like 12 of the 16 buttons
2019-10-29T20:04:56  <the-t-in-rtf> the analog buttons are more challenging, you need something with 200k ohm resistance, and most analog buttons have like 10k

2019-10-29T20:06:26  <the-t-in-rtf> so if you're making something where you don't need the triggers, you're fine
2019-10-29T20:06:35  <sgithens> can you just use it as a usb device and map it to stuff
2019-10-29T20:06:52  <the-t-in-rtf> well, the device itself has a d-pad and a few buttons
2019-10-29T20:06:56  <sgithens> like could I map these pedals to control an meta for using emacs?
2019-10-29T20:07:03  <the-t-in-rtf> sure you could
2019-10-29T20:07:17  <the-t-in-rtf> and making a foot pedal on/off switch would be trivial
2019-10-29T20:07:20  <sgithens> I've always wanted to do that with a device that made it really easy to map things to regular keyboard stuff
2019-10-29T20:07:33  <sgithens> without compiling c libraries and stuff
2019-10-29T20:07:38  <the-t-in-rtf> the keyboard bit might take a little more doing, but I know there are utilities
2019-10-29T20:07:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I mainly use the HTML5 gamepad API
2019-10-29T20:08:52  <sgithens> I wonder, do we have a flag or something that marks a setting as not having any reasonalbe default value
2019-10-29T20:09:08  <the-t-in-rtf> define reasonable
2019-10-29T20:09:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I do check to make sure it matches the schema
2019-10-29T20:09:32  <the-t-in-rtf> and if it's invalid according to the schema I throw an error
2019-10-29T20:09:37  <the-t-in-rtf> at least for primitives
2019-10-29T20:09:39  <sgithens> well, something that after several hour long meetings we couldn't decide on what the default value should be
2019-10-29T20:10:10  <the-t-in-rtf> it's json5 for now and will be JS or something later, leave a comment, man.
2019-10-29T20:10:25  <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess you'd want to know programatically.
2019-10-29T20:10:37  <sgithens> yeah, but starting with a comment would be fine
2019-10-29T20:10:43  <sgithens> eventually the tool would need to parse it
2019-10-29T20:10:52  <sgithens> not a big deal
2019-10-29T20:21:00  <the-t-in-rtf> so, I was having a similar discussion with JJ
2019-10-29T20:21:14  <the-t-in-rtf> you can park any old metadata you like outside the "schema" block
2019-10-29T20:21:30  <the-t-in-rtf> so for individual settings that have no sensible default you can make whatever tag you like
2019-10-29T20:21:43  <the-t-in-rtf> { tough: true, schema: { //... } )
