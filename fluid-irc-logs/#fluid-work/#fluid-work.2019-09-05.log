2019-09-05T15:52:36  <Justin_o> cindyli: when you have some free time, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/960 is ready for more review.
2019-09-05T15:52:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you are available, https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/35 is ready for more review.
2019-09-05T15:53:41  <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2019-09-05T15:53:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also should we schedule some time to talk about Prefs Framework refactoring. Specifically around making it easier/possible to configure which preferences and adjusters are available, and what order they appear in on the panel.
2019-09-05T15:54:08  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2019-09-05T15:54:23  <Bosmon> Although I'm thinking that anything we do in the medium term will just have to be done in terms of the existing aux schema
2019-09-05T15:54:27  <Bosmon> Which I think is probably powerful enough
2019-09-05T15:54:39  <Bosmon> I mean, that is why it was invented : P
2019-09-05T15:55:07  <Bosmon> The only bigger challenge is the overall page template, which we'll have to come up with some interim solution for
2019-09-05T15:55:17  <Bosmon> But I believe that itself could also be generated from the aux schema
2019-09-05T15:55:47  <Justin_o> for the medium term it might just be breaking up https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js into more compassable grades
2019-09-05T15:56:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we might be able to use the new view supports. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/NewViewSupport.js
2019-09-05T15:56:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - What grades do you imagine breaking up there?
2019-09-05T15:57:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: providing individual schemas for each https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/SelfVoicingSchemas.js
2019-09-05T15:57:31  <Justin_o> sorry I guess I really should have linked to the starter schemas
2019-09-05T15:58:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so this would work for the integrator, but not sure how the end user could specify these things
2019-09-05T16:01:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: anyways, when would be a good time to talk about this in more depth?
2019-09-05T16:02:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the end user can just use a tool or supply a JSON file which encodes an aux schema, and then the builder takes it from there
2019-09-05T16:02:20  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm available most times from tomorrow
2019-09-05T16:03:46  <Justin_o> I could do from about 7 - 10am my time tomorrow, or sometime next week
2019-09-05T16:04:58  <Justin_o> I'm free most of the day on Monday. 8:30am - 4:30pm except for 11am-12pm.
2019-09-05T16:05:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: any of those times work for you?
2019-09-05T16:06:56  <Bosmon> How about Monday 10am?
2019-09-05T16:08:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, sounds good.
2019-09-05T16:09:10  <Justin_o> I added it to the fluid calendar

2019-09-05T16:42:48  <cindyli> Bosmon: shall we talk about the solution for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4036 when you have time? in case you didn't see it, what's causing the problem is described in this comment - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4036?focusedCommentId=40003&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40003
2019-09-05T16:44:07  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I saw that issue going by
2019-09-05T16:44:18  <Bosmon> I had trouble following what the problem was : P
2019-09-05T16:46:47  <cindyli> the problem was, if a key-in triggers the start of an application such as "Windows Magnifier" or "Read & Write" -> use QSS to adjust any settings even though these settings are not relevant to these application ->  when the changed settings applied, these applications will restart
2019-09-05T16:48:17  <cindyli> Bosmon: one feature of these applications is, in the solution registry, values for "settingsHandlers.configure.liveness" are set to https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6814 or https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4036?focusedCommentId=40003&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#L6814
2019-09-05T16:49:00  <cindyli> correction of above: values for "settingsHandlers.configure.liveness" are set to "liveRestart" or "manualRestart"
2019-09-05T16:50:32  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think your explanation is very good
2019-09-05T16:50:39  <Bosmon> It's just that the issue is quite hard to understand : P
2019-09-05T16:52:16  <cindyli> i see, i can adjust the jira description if stegru, the creator of this jira, approves it ;)
2019-09-05T17:00:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: for https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCAPI.html#fluidqueryiocselectorroot-selector-flat
2019-09-05T17:00:25  <Justin_o> how can I get the member name for the compoenent?
2019-09-05T17:00:30  <Justin_o> so that I can use that as the namespace
2019-09-05T17:01:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can throw it into fluid.pathForComponent and extract the last array element
2019-09-05T17:02:10  <Bosmon> Sorry that this seems a bit roundabout compared to just introspecting into options.components but I promise it will work out better in the long run :)
2019-09-05T17:02:34  <Justin_o> haha okay thanks
2019-09-05T17:03:36  <Bosmon> options.components was always going to be the source of endless obscure bugs anyway - for example https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5614 which is now fixed
2019-09-05T17:03:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also for fluid.queryIoCSelector is there a way to say only look at the direct children
2019-09-05T17:04:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, you can supply "true" for the 3rd argument, "flat"
2019-09-05T17:04:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay thought so, but it said it was going to be slow so wasn't sure if that was actually doing something else
2019-09-05T17:05:14  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, the comment is the wrong way round, just fixing it in my branch : P
2019-09-05T17:05:36  *** avtar <avtar!~avtar@ip-24-50-175-83.user.start.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-09-05T17:05:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks
2019-09-05T17:05:42  <Bosmon> It should say it will be slow if flat is falsy
2019-09-05T17:06:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes more sense now. thanks
2019-09-05T17:06:38  <Bosmon> Justin_o - to continue on the previous theme, there were always going to be numerous reasons why introspecting on options.components is bad
2019-09-05T17:07:13  <Bosmon> Given it is just a static snapshot of one author's view of what is meant to be in the component tree, it will always be at risk of not capturing all the other sources of information, e.g. options distributions targetting the components
2019-09-05T17:07:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this isn't something I need anymore, but I had been exploring using dynamic components for this current work, but wasn't sure how to set up a model relay that was specific to each dynamic component. Is there a way to do that?
2019-09-05T17:07:34  <Bosmon> The only really sound way to know what is there is to look at what actually arrives
2019-09-05T17:08:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was worried about that actually, so glad there is a way around it. I wasn't aware that we could find out the components by some other mechanism. It might be nice to surface this as method on the component directly, but then again maybe it's not worth the overhead for something that isn't used much
2019-09-05T17:09:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - for your per-dynamic component relay, you could try using "lensed components" which I am at this moment trying to get working : P
2019-09-05T17:09:37  <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L3742
2019-09-05T17:09:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - but could you say a little more about how you wanted each relay to be different?
2019-09-05T17:10:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also I ran into an issue when I accidentally named a member and component the same. Took me a while to figure out what I had done. Perhaps some better diagnostics or some separation in how each are accessed.
2019-09-05T17:10:16  <Justin_o> not sure
2019-09-05T17:10:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that one is written up as https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5761
2019-09-05T17:11:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in practice, lensed components would solve all the design issues you are currently facing
2019-09-05T17:11:32  <Justin_o> Bosmon: they sound amazing :)
2019-09-05T17:11:33  <Bosmon> Since you'd just set up the relevant material in the top-level component's model and then just say "off you go"
2019-09-05T17:12:30  <Justin_o> sounds great.. your test case does look like what I wanted to do
2019-09-05T17:14:05  <Justin_o> Would this also work the other way, that is create a model path in the parent from the dynamic component.
2019-09-05T17:14:43  <Justin_o> Perhaps this wouldn't be necessary, but maybe for collecting all these model paths from dynamic components might be helpful
2019-09-05T17:15:15  <Justin_o> actually I guess that might work already
2019-09-05T17:15:31  <stegru> cindyli, anything you do is fine with me
