2020-02-21T00:21:19  <SemicolonExp> Hi, I'm interested in the GSoC game controller project. I noticed on the page it says to do a write up on using just your keyboard to browse the internet. I was wondering how and where to submit that.
2020-02-21T00:21:42  <SemicolonExp> Also is "the-t-in-rtf" listed after irc for the project a person or a channel for the project?

2020-02-21T13:47:54  <jhung> Aashim a good place to start would be to look at the github repos for the current FLOE and Fluid websites. This way you can understand how they're currently structured.
2020-02-21T13:49:00  <jhung> Then start looking into how Hugo it is used to generate static websites.
2020-02-21T13:57:04  <Aashim> If i find any issue should in these repo. should i submit as an issue and send a pr for this?
