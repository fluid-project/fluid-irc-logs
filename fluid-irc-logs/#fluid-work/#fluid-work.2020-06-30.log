2020-06-30T11:58:53  <gtirloni> Justin_o: thanks for the review on the CI PRs so far. should I wait for more feedback or do you think it's okay to merge?
2020-06-30T12:06:20  <Justin_o> gtirloni: will we be shutting down Jenkins once those get in?
2020-06-30T12:06:47  <Justin_o> and if so, is there any functionality that we're still missing?
2020-06-30T12:07:14  <Justin_o> I'm guessing browser test coverage will sort of actually improve with GitHub Actions as we're testing on more platforms, but with the same browsers
2020-06-30T12:07:54  <gtirloni> not entirely. jenkins still has some CD pipelines for the build website and other things... it'll still be up for the foreseeable future while the CD situation isn't worked on (which I'm working on). I think we'd like to at least remove the webhooks from the kettle/infusion repos to avoid unnecessary builds (the jenkins builds do take longer)
2020-06-30T12:27:31  <Justin_o> gtirloni: so CD still in Jenkins, CI all in GitHub.. not loss of functionality for CI during the move.
2020-06-30T12:27:38  <Justin_o> ?
2020-06-30T12:29:54  <gtirloni> yep, seems like it
2020-06-30T12:36:00  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, I'll take a look at the PRs.
2020-06-30T12:36:46  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I think in the future we may want to look at something like https://coveralls.io and something similar that will also show the test results (not sure if coveralls does that). So that it's easier to track changes over time and clearly see the results without having to dig through the console logs of the action.
2020-06-30T12:37:24  <gtirloni> +1
2020-06-30T12:39:52  <Justin_o> gtirloni: by the way, have you figured out a way to test GitHub Actions without having to actually push them up to GitHub?
2020-06-30T12:41:53  <gtirloni> I've been pushing to my own fork/branch and, if the workflow doesn't have a big IF blocking me, I build in my fork first.. I open a PR from my fork's feature branch to my fork's master branch and see how that goes
2020-06-30T12:42:32  <gtirloni> so no, nothing locally
2020-06-30T12:42:49  <gtirloni> I've found that editing the workflows through the GitHub UI is better too
2020-06-30T12:42:59  <gtirloni> the editor provides a lot of code completion and error checking
2020-06-30T12:43:08  <Justin_o> gtirloni: oh, that's interesting
2020-06-30T12:43:21  <Justin_o> I wonder if they have a plugin for IDEs
2020-06-30T12:43:38  <gtirloni> sometimes I'll push the workflow and it breaks, but there's no information at all in the UI... I've contacted support about it many times and, although they promise to talk to the developers, they say that if I had edited in the Web UI, I'd see the error more easily
2020-06-30T12:43:54  <Justin_o> :(
2020-06-30T12:44:42  <Justin_o> yah when I was trying to get the Lighthouse stuff tested, it was pretty much a black box for the errors I was getting. Some tasks were just skipped and didn't indicate why at all, and no console logs either.
2020-06-30T12:46:52  <Justin_o> Well this won't help with those issues but it looks like a useful extension for VSCode https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cschleiden.vscode-github-actions
2020-06-30T12:48:56  <gtirloni> agreed, it's a blackbox sometimes and if you submit incorrect YAML, more so.. they don't seem to report formatting error and the like
2020-06-30T12:49:01  <gtirloni> I don't like that aspect of it much
2020-06-30T12:49:10  <Justin_o> gtirloni: So I'm noticing something with the GitHub CI runs. Here's an example from building your PR. https://github.com/jobara/infusion/runs/822396439
2020-06-30T12:49:50  <Justin_o> so you've split the node and browser tests, which on one had make things easier to parse and read, but the negative result is that we don't get the summary with the coverage report
2020-06-30T12:51:08  <gtirloni> the one at the end of the browser tests?
2020-06-30T12:51:18  <gtirloni> does it include the node.js tests if run together?
2020-06-30T12:53:45  <Justin_o> yes
2020-06-30T12:54:20  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I think the testem run will consolidate the reports
2020-06-30T12:55:15  <Justin_o> gtirloni: actually there's a post test run https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/package.json#L31
2020-06-30T12:55:42  <Justin_o> so maybe we just need to add that as a task after the other two
2020-06-30T12:58:08  <Justin_o> I wonder if it would also be better to just call the npm scripts instead of replicating the calls in the GitHub action.. anyways, I think you can look into those in your second PR because that one touches the workflow file
2020-06-30T12:58:12  <Justin_o> what do you think?
2020-06-30T12:58:29  <Justin_o> gtirloni: ^
2020-06-30T14:01:56  <gtirloni> Justin_o: sorry for the delay, yep, i agree. I'll work on it

2020-06-30T18:28:38  <gtirloni> \o/
2020-06-30T18:34:54  <Justin_o> clown: congrats :)
2020-06-30T18:34:58  <Justin_o> thanks for the update too
2020-06-30T18:35:55  <clown> thanks gtirloni Justin_o.   And, I hope that helps with your work on UIO+ for Morphic, Justin_o
2020-06-30T18:48:38  <Justin_o> clown: thanks.. I just need to get my PR in now.
2020-06-30T18:49:27  <Justin_o> clown, cindyli: do either of you have access to change the description of this repo https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension It should say "UIO+ For Morphic" instead of "UI Options Plus Chrome Extension"
2020-06-30T18:51:45  <cindyli> Justin_o: the description has been changed, probably clown did it
2020-06-30T18:52:17  <cindyli> the readme needs a pull request. there are many appearance of "UIO+ For Morphic" in it
2020-06-30T18:52:55  <Justin_o> cindyli: it should say "UIO+ for Morphic"
2020-06-30T18:53:48  <cindyli> ah i see
2020-06-30T18:54:20  <cindyli> let's see if i have access. trying...
2020-06-30T18:54:49  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2020-06-30T18:56:53  <cindyli> Justin_o: unfortunately, i don't have access. i can change this description for my own repos but not GPII repos
2020-06-30T18:59:07  <clown> okay, just catching up to this Justin_o.  Let me see if I can change itâ€¦
2020-06-30T19:00:59  <clown> nope, I don't have access either, Justin_o
2020-06-30T19:01:33  <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: thanks for checking
2020-06-30T19:19:48  <gmoss> Justin_o: is there a demo page for the Orator component? I feel like I've seen it but haven't found a link yet
2020-06-30T19:20:14  <gmoss> I'm just filing a Jira now for the bug we found earlier
2020-06-30T19:20:19  <gmoss> *discussed
2020-06-30T19:20:27  <Justin_o> gmoss: https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/orator/
2020-06-30T19:20:34  <gmoss> awesome thanks Justin_o :)
2020-06-30T19:20:38  <Justin_o> np
2020-06-30T19:20:42  <Justin_o> thanks for filing the issue
2020-06-30T19:26:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6523
2020-06-30T19:27:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-06-30T19:39:51  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I changed the repo description
2020-06-30T19:39:59  <Bosmon> You don't think it should read "UIO+ for Morphic Chrome Extension"?
2020-06-30T19:58:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure that sounds good too
2020-06-30T19:58:20  <Justin_o> and thanks for updating the repo description for me
2020-06-30T21:06:16  <gmoss> gtirloni: it looks like the Storytelling Tool didn't redeploy after my SJRK-288 PR got merged just over an hour ago. I think it may be because this line says "fluidproject" and not "fluid-project": https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/124ca75934d39db06645c1cd017a7966efa6da49/.github/workflows/stack_master.yml#L14
2020-06-30T21:06:16  <gmoss> I guess I missed this from your SJRK-362 PR (it was merged before I got a chance to review, I didn't check afterwards)
2020-06-30T21:06:56  <gmoss> I can make the fix, I just want to run it by you since I don't know if there's any special configuration which that line refers to that I'm not aware of
2020-06-30T21:24:12  <gmoss> gtirloni: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/86
2020-06-30T22:16:23  <gmoss> gtirloni: I've also noticed the staging site smoketest URL is returning an error, maybe related to the same deploy issue: https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/stories
