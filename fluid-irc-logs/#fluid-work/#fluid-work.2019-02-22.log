2019-02-22T08:43:30  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning.  I have locally verified the new "external" mode for gpii-couchdb-test-harness that we'll need to unstick the windows acceptance tests.
2019-02-22T08:43:54  <the-t-in-rtf> Moving on to writing the provisioning steps and tests to verify that we can get it to work in a Windows VM.
2019-02-22T08:44:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I have good notes from our discussions yesterday, I'll verify it once manually and then write a script.
2019-02-22T08:44:38  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2019-02-22T08:59:54  <the-t-in-rtf> Testing universal in a Windows VM with the new version and environment variable.
2019-02-22T09:13:24  <the-t-in-rtf> Here's the pull to bring the new version into universal: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/743
2019-02-22T09:14:48  <the-t-in-rtf> working on the provisioning scripts now.
2019-02-22T09:47:32  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru (or anyone) is there an easy downloader installed on our Vagrant VMs, like wget or curl?
2019-02-22T09:51:38  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, both throw errors when attempting to download stuff
2019-02-22T09:51:58  <the-t-in-rtf> nm, just need to not use HTTPS for whatever reason
2019-02-22T09:52:02  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a download, so no biggie
2019-02-22T10:20:31  <the-t-in-rtf> testing automatic provisioning now
2019-02-22T10:31:19  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, you around  yet?
2019-02-22T10:31:30  <the-t-in-rtf> trying to make the curl call block until it completes
2019-02-22T10:31:42  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a wrapper around Invoke-Webrequest
2019-02-22T10:36:49  <the-t-in-rtf> nm, just installed wget
2019-02-22T10:37:17  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, your /passive trick worked well
2019-02-22T10:37:26  <the-t-in-rtf> just testing my configuration script manually
2019-02-22T10:49:04  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: hey
2019-02-22T10:49:15  <jhernandez> yeh, it worked
2019-02-22T10:49:41  <jhernandez> btw, the-t-in-rtf, I have everything ready
2019-02-22T10:49:45  <jhernandez> in a windows pr
2019-02-22T10:50:14  <the-t-in-rtf> awesome
2019-02-22T10:50:16  <jhernandez> it's only missing the last couple of things
2019-02-22T10:50:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I have the provisioning bits you need
2019-02-22T10:50:25  <jhernandez> changing the default listening port
2019-02-22T10:50:28  <the-t-in-rtf> I am just testing those
2019-02-22T10:50:30  <the-t-in-rtf> already taken care of
2019-02-22T10:50:31  <jhernandez> and restarting the service
2019-02-22T10:50:36  <the-t-in-rtf> doesn't need to
2019-02-22T10:50:44  <jhernandez> doesn't need what?
2019-02-22T10:50:48  <the-t-in-rtf> couch reconfigures itself without a restart
2019-02-22T10:52:23  <jhernandez> hmmm, not what I experienced yesterday
2019-02-22T10:52:48  <the-t-in-rtf> don't know what to tell you, but maybe I'm using another method
2019-02-22T10:52:57  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I hit the _config REST endpoint
2019-02-22T10:54:38  <jhernandez> okay, I just pushed those 2 last steps
2019-02-22T10:54:53  <jhernandez> we can remove afterwards
2019-02-22T10:54:56  <jhernandez> if we want
2019-02-22T10:55:27  <the-t-in-rtf> it's fine to have two examples of a working config and then decide how to fix it long term
2019-02-22T10:55:30  <the-t-in-rtf> better than having zero
2019-02-22T10:56:18  <jhernandez> do we need to set an env variable or the like?
2019-02-22T10:57:37  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-02-22T10:57:53  <the-t-in-rtf> in fact my tests failed because I forgot to do that in the VM provisioning
2019-02-22T10:58:10  <the-t-in-rtf> GPII_TEST_COUCH_USE_EXTERNAL
2019-02-22T11:00:04  <the-t-in-rtf> what's the easiest way to set an environment variable from the command line?>
2019-02-22T11:00:39  <jhernandez> $env:VAR="whatever"
2019-02-22T11:00:56  <jhernandez> but, I was thinking
2019-02-22T11:01:05  <jhernandez> ....
2019-02-22T11:01:34  <jhernandez> we also want to run the system in addition to run tests
2019-02-22T11:02:30  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the flag has test in it, but you can use the harness for other things
2019-02-22T11:03:05  <jhernandez> I'm wondering if we just need to supply a more generic variable to running the tests AND the gpii
2019-02-22T11:05:29  <the-t-in-rtf> Cindy, Antranig and I were planning to meet at 15:00 CET
2019-02-22T11:05:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it would be good to discuss there
2019-02-22T11:05:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I asked for it to be at 15:00 because I'm leaving for a lunch appointment in five minutes
2019-02-22T11:05:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I got up early to get the fix in.
2019-02-22T11:07:56  <jhernandez> cool
2019-02-22T11:08:14  <jhernandez> I'll test my pr against your windows branch
2019-02-22T11:08:20  <jhernandez> s/windows/universal
2019-02-22T11:09:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I put it in so you could easily cut a dev release
2019-02-22T11:10:08  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll commit an updated version shortly, but the only change is tests
2019-02-22T11:10:14  <the-t-in-rtf> so you should  have what you need for now
2019-02-22T11:10:18  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, back in a bit
2019-02-22T11:10:31  <jhernandez> sure, enjoy your lunch!
2019-02-22T11:10:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a driving lesson, but I hope it will be OK
2019-02-22T11:11:03  <jhernandez> let's hope that
2019-02-22T11:11:04  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-22T11:11:09  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], if you're attending the onboarding meeting, I need you to report for me
2019-02-22T11:11:17  <the-t-in-rtf> a) the big pull blocking onboarding is in
2019-02-22T11:11:23  <the-t-in-rtf> b) my magic and nvda pulls are in
2019-02-22T11:11:34  <the-t-in-rtf> c) I'm working on unblocking windows acceptance tests with the rest of the team
2019-02-22T11:11:46  <the-t-in-rtf> d) I'll move on to validating payloads as soon as c) is addressed
2019-02-22T11:12:11  <the-t-in-rtf> the big pull that unblocks onboarding, I mean for a)
2019-02-22T11:12:58  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: great, I will report for you, if anything important arises, I will write you an email with it.
2019-02-22T12:38:07  <Bosmon> Hi jhernandez - why now 35984 rather than 25984 ?
2019-02-22T12:38:21  <jhernandez> that's what I saw in the-t-in-rtf's PR
2019-02-22T12:38:36  <Bosmon> ok
2019-02-22T12:39:33  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-couchdb-test-harness/pull/1/files#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R19
2019-02-22T12:39:35  <Bosmon> You're becoming quite the PowerShell "Hotliner" : P
2019-02-22T12:39:47  <jhernandez> heh
2019-02-22T12:40:03  <jhernandez> HOT PS LINES!
2019-02-22T12:40:04  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-22T12:40:33  <jhernandez> well, the PR is only missing the bits to add the env variable
2019-02-22T12:41:09  <jhernandez> I can't get the tests to run even by manually setting the env variable
2019-02-22T12:42:00  <jhernandez> I'll add it to the PR so we can see it failing on CI
2019-02-22T12:42:03  <Bosmon> What failure do you get now?
2019-02-22T12:45:23  <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/MWN7dEE9
2019-02-22T13:04:28  <jhernandez> just updated the PR with the env variable
2019-02-22T13:04:46  <jhernandez> but I guess it's a provisional way to set it until we figure out the best way/place to do it
2019-02-22T13:17:53  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I'm not sure you can set environment variables from an npm script like that? : P
2019-02-22T13:19:58  <jhernandez> Bosmon: I AM
2019-02-22T13:20:19  <Bosmon> jhernandez - it works?
2019-02-22T13:20:19  <jhernandez> I mean, it worked here
2019-02-22T13:20:23  <Bosmon> Incredible
2019-02-22T13:20:30  <jhernandez> let's see if it works on CI

2019-02-22T13:22:32  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, guys, 35984 is only for the gpii-couchdb-test-harness package
2019-02-22T13:22:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I can make the provisioning script take a parameter
2019-02-22T13:23:08  <Bosmon> Let's just pick a port
2019-02-22T13:23:26  <the-t-in-rtf> I can also just update the gpii-couchdb-test-harness package to match universal
2019-02-22T13:23:29  <the-t-in-rtf> less work
2019-02-22T13:23:34  <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2019-02-22T13:24:16  <Bosmon> I was just reading up about the meaning of &&, it seems that these scripts are indeed executed by the OS shell directly and are not interpreted by npm
2019-02-22T13:24:20  <Bosmon> In this case, by cmd.exe
2019-02-22T13:24:38  <Bosmon> I find it totally miraculous that there is a && operator at all, but it seems there is : P
2019-02-22T13:25:02  <jhernandez> yeah, I think we make use of them in universal already, right?
2019-02-22T13:25:10  <Bosmon> This thread indicates that the behaviour is somewhat buggy in that the 2nd script is always run even if the first fails - https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4040
2019-02-22T13:25:28  <Bosmon> Yes, I know we use them, but the fact you were able to set environment variables from them raises interesting questions about how they actually WORK : P
2019-02-22T13:25:57  * jhernandez nods
2019-02-22T13:25:58  <Bosmon> I had always thought that npm would never do anything so insane as to just literally sling the arguments to the OS shell which will be different on every platform
2019-02-22T13:26:19  <Bosmon> But it seems this behaviour is consistent with their general love of quality that they show in all areas
2019-02-22T13:27:34  <jhernandez> yeah, deep inside of me, there are a lof of things about node/npm/electron that I prefer not trying to understand - I'm happy if it just works :P

2019-02-22T15:04:33  <Bosmon> We are trying to get the Windows acceptance tests running again running against CouchDB and we get this error from within spiSettingsHandler.setHighContrastTheme
2019-02-22T15:05:22  <Bosmon> I was speculating if GPII-2809 could be involved but I haven't merged either part of that

2019-02-22T15:29:25  <Bosmon> jhernandez - so I think that there is some fault earlier in the matchmaking process, and that the system shouldn't be expecting to update this theme file
2019-02-22T15:29:48  <Bosmon> The date on my version of aero.theme is April 11 2018 suggesting it has not been rewritten since the VM was installed
2019-02-22T15:29:57  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-02-22T15:35:59  <javjarfer[m]> sry I was in a meeting, I think the last merge in my pulls was 16 days ago and was GPII-3644: Additional pointer options, apart from that, I don't see anything else
2019-02-22T15:41:08  <Bosmon> jhernandez, the-t-in-rtf - I'm suspecting this might be to do with the-t-in-rtf running from a git-based release rather than from npm
2019-02-22T15:41:13  <Bosmon> that is, a git-based release of universal
2019-02-22T15:43:55  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I've published 0.3.0-dev.20190222T143201Z.8ce0bde5.GPII-3741 from the latest state of his branch to check this out
2019-02-22T15:48:41  <Bosmon> jhernandez - it has not helped :(

2019-02-22T15:49:10  <jhernandez> I happened to have a morphic version installed in the vm
2019-02-22T15:49:21  <jhernandez> turned highContrast on and off with no problems
2019-02-22T15:49:37  <jhernandez> now there is no such EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Windows\resources\Themes\aero.theme'
2019-02-22T15:50:16  <jhernandez> running the tests again to see if they now pass
2019-02-22T15:50:58  <jhernandez> (if windows allows me to do so) - waiting
2019-02-22T15:56:14  <jhernandez> ok, now running tests
2019-02-22T15:56:31  <jhernandez> I see that Alfredo just applied the change to CI
2019-02-22T15:57:25  <jhernandez> ok to test-ing again
2019-02-22T16:02:57  <jhernandez> ok, local tests are still failing, but not giving the EPERM error anymore, so I think it's more related to recent changes in universal/windows
2019-02-22T16:34:33  <jhernandez> ok
2019-02-22T16:34:40  <jhernandez> now CI is setting the env variable
2019-02-22T16:35:02  <jhernandez> and is indeed hitting the EPERM error https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/815/console
2019-02-22T16:35:14  <jhernandez> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/815/consoleText
2019-02-22T16:40:11  <jhernandez> so yeah, might be something related to a recent change in universal/windows
2019-02-22T16:44:47  <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2019-02-22T16:45:35  <Bosmon> jhernandez - i'm now starting to suspect that it is some linkage which the-t-in-rtf 's work has cut between some of the crucial grades, perhaps the resolvers
2019-02-22T16:45:51  <Bosmon> We need to look at what the inputs are to that SPI function and find out why it thinks it should try to rewrite that file
2019-02-22T16:45:51  <jhernandez> really?
2019-02-22T16:46:03  <jhernandez> hm
2019-02-22T16:46:12  <jhernandez> interesting
2019-02-22T16:53:53  *** michelled <michelled!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-wpmphnevmlaakiki> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-02-22T16:57:58  <jhernandez> as far as I can tell, it's trying to save the theme because saving the theme is part of our workflow when dealing with any highContrast change
2019-02-22T16:58:10  <jhernandez> so we don't mess up the system (too much)
2019-02-22T16:58:11  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-22T16:58:33  <jhernandez> so, the reason why is being saved is there
2019-02-22T16:58:47  <jhernandez> os_win7 prefset enables highContrast theme
2019-02-22T17:00:45  <jhernandez> what I can see from os_win7 is that it only sets highContrast, and not setting any theme
2019-02-22T17:02:06  <jhernandez> this hasn't been a problem so far
2019-02-22T17:02:18  <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2019-02-22T17:02:59  <Bosmon> jhernandez - but I strongly suspect it has never tried to save this theme at all
2019-02-22T17:03:09  <jhernandez> maybe you are absolutely right
2019-02-22T17:03:13  <Bosmon> I bet if we trace through into this function call in current trunk, we will find that it tries to do something else
2019-02-22T17:03:15  <jhernandez> and we were living a lie
2019-02-22T17:03:21  <Bosmon> Either save a different file elsewhere, or not save it at all
2019-02-22T17:03:37  <jhernandez> and now, some of recent changes has exposed this
2019-02-22T17:04:40  <jhernandez> let me check one thing
2019-02-22T17:06:16  <jhernandez> need to destroy my vm - need to test with a fresh win
2019-02-22T17:14:46  <jhernandez> meanwhile ... stegru any thoughts? we're trying to figure out the EPERM failure here https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/815/consoleText
2019-02-22T17:16:04  <stegru> as you can see, jhernandez, it's trying to write to a file when it has no permission to
2019-02-22T17:16:33  <stegru> why is it writing to this file? i don't yet know

2019-02-22T17:34:52  <stegru> sorry, ubuntu decided to perform its weekly crash
2019-02-22T17:35:12  <jhernandez> heh
2019-02-22T17:35:13  <stegru> or gnome
2019-02-22T17:35:52  <jhernandez> as far as I can tell, saveAs is "blablabla ... resources/aero.theme"
2019-02-22T17:36:06  <jhernandez> when calling the spi function
2019-02-22T17:36:14  <stegru> pr link?
2019-02-22T17:36:46  <jhernandez> sure
2019-02-22T17:37:04  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/245
2019-02-22T17:37:21  <jhernandez> you will need to provision the vm from scratch to get couchdb installed
2019-02-22T17:37:31  <stegru> oh - nothing has changed

2019-02-22T17:52:05  <stegru> it doesn't fix the cause of the fault, but it stops it from happening
2019-02-22T17:56:17  <jhernandez> aha
