2019-08-12T13:22:20  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], you're back today?
2019-08-12T13:22:34  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I've been working with your performance scripts, thanks again for those.
2019-08-12T13:22:49  <javjarfer[m]> hi there the-t-in-rtf yes, I'm back!
2019-08-12T13:22:53  <the-t-in-rtf> great
2019-08-12T13:22:58  <javjarfer[m]> that's great, yw!
2019-08-12T13:23:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I am testing a broader suite of settings tests in your repo, I may submit a pull just so you have those.
2019-08-12T13:23:25  <the-t-in-rtf> and then I'll use that as the basis of a pull against gpii-infra
2019-08-12T13:24:04  <the-t-in-rtf> the new suite logs in as a snapset user, copies and tweaks their settings, then logs in as a real user and saves them
2019-08-12T13:24:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I also added a couple of invalid PUTs so that we check both our validation and our checks to prevent updating read-only snapsets
2019-08-12T13:25:28  <the-t-in-rtf> you must have written this a while back, it still had a bunch of snapsets that are gone
2019-08-12T13:25:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I also pruned those

2019-08-12T13:27:36  <jhernandez> Justin_o: hey
2019-08-12T13:27:58  <jhernandez> last release (1.2) comes from my GPII-4004 branch
2019-08-12T13:30:05  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks
2019-08-12T13:33:17  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: that's great, those complete more real life workflows we are going to experience
2019-08-12T13:34:54  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, right now we only test GETs without logging in, testing logins alone is a huge improvement.
2019-08-12T13:35:11  <the-t-in-rtf> speaking of which, need to add a TODO to try getting a safe without logging in
2019-08-12T13:35:40  <the-t-in-rtf> we can talk about breaking these down into various "nice" and "naughty" scenarios and choosing which to run when
2019-08-12T13:35:48  <the-t-in-rtf> but it's good to know we can test more of them now

2019-08-12T17:27:19  <gmoss> Bosmon: I'm not sure if you're working today, but I'm finally taking a look at your pull request into my SJRK-255 branch. I see that there are a few missing js file refs in the html files. I think since you're not working on this issue this week (according to what you said Thursday last), I'll merge your PR and then I'll fix those things and any resulting 404s
2019-08-12T17:28:04  <gmoss> I think the changes are great though, much less smelly and race-prone

2019-08-12T17:59:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: hello
2019-08-12T17:59:03  <sgithens> maybe I should try going back even further.... I'm on 5.3.0
2019-08-12T17:59:16  <sgithens> it is getting really pretty annoying
2019-08-12T17:59:33  <sgithens> it's almost a 1/3 chance now that starting up the VM will freeze my machine

2019-08-12T20:05:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: continuing looking at FLUID-6148 in UIO+. I'm finding now that this line ( https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/src/content_scripts/contentView.js#L87 ) is getting an error "that.locate is not a function".
2019-08-12T20:07:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I assume it's because it's resolving the "content" member ( https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/src/content_scripts/contentView.js#L49-L54 ) before the "dom" member has been resolved.
