2020-04-23T11:59:12  <jhernandez> yesterday, I had a live session with HA to figure out why they weren't getting the "right" default values out of the pspChannel
2020-04-23T11:59:37  <jhernandez> so, apparently, it was a result of several issues
2020-04-23T11:59:53  <jhernandez> and I spent the morning trying to figure out things

2020-04-23T12:01:23  <jhernandez> I still need to check whether the default values are coming from the pspChannel (which I assume it'll be okay), but so far, I see two problems when fetching the remote defaultSettings
2020-04-23T12:01:42  <jhernandez> so, we were trying to pull a json5 file
2020-04-23T12:03:09  <jhernandez> which resulted in an error
2020-04-23T12:04:00  <jhernandez> but the error is not being logged

2020-04-23T15:29:42  <jhernandez> just created a tiny PR
2020-04-23T15:40:56  <jhernandez> cindyli, Bosmon: also, another question regarding the PSPChannel
2020-04-23T15:41:27  <jhernandez> I'm getting the following payload from the qss
2020-04-23T15:41:49  <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/fAuq9hLa
2020-04-23T15:45:50  <jhernandez> we have settingsControls, then we have settingGroups (where we have another settingsControls) and finally we have qssSettingControls
2020-04-23T15:48:58  <jhernandez> what's the difference between (or purpose of) all these 3 blocks?
2020-04-23T15:49:23  <cindyli> jhernandez: "settingsControls" block is the output from the PSPChannel, but not "settingGroups"
2020-04-23T15:49:44  <cindyli> the search in gpii-app repo shows "settingGroups" is generated in there
2020-04-23T15:49:58  <cindyli> "qssSettingControls" is from gpii-app too
2020-04-23T15:51:19  <jhernandez> so, somehow, gpii-app is messing up the model hold at the pspchannel component?
2020-04-23T15:52:11  <cindyli> jhernandez: gpii-app might generate those blocks for its own reason, which i don't know
2020-04-23T15:52:44  <jhernandez> because I'm receiving this payload from https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/gpiiConnector.js#L202

2020-04-23T16:49:17  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm planning to close my SJRK-334 PR on the CI repo, since gtirloni's work on FLUID-6495 will supersede it. Is that okay?
2020-04-23T16:49:39  <gmoss> (not that I expected you to review that PR)
2020-04-23T16:51:54  <cindyli> sure, gmoss
2020-04-23T16:52:02  <cindyli> go for it
2020-04-23T16:52:45  <gmoss> done :)
2020-04-23T16:52:55  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
