2019-05-17T15:26:24  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2019-05-17T16:02:52  <cindyli> hi jhernand_, stegru, in the windows VM from gpii/windows repo, how can I start GPII manually and all locally, including LFM, CBFM and local couchdb docker image? what i'm doing now is:
2019-05-17T16:02:54  <cindyli> cd v:
2019-05-17T16:02:59  <cindyli> set GPII_TEST_COUCH_USE_EXTERNAL=TRUE
2019-05-17T16:03:02  <cindyli> node gpii.js
2019-05-17T16:03:36  <cindyli> LFM and CBFM starts locally but the test data is not loaded into couchdb docker image
2019-05-17T16:04:00  <cindyli> accessing couchdb fouton doesn't show "gpii" database
2019-05-17T16:05:21  <cindyli> and login requests are complaining about "cannot find the GPII key" although keys i'm using are typical snapsets from testData/preferences dir
2019-05-17T16:05:27  <cindyli> any ideas?
2019-05-17T16:08:02  <stegru> type "v:" instead of "cd v:" ?
2019-05-17T16:08:34  <stegru> oh, don't you need to delete + rebuilt the database?

2019-05-17T16:17:55  <cindyli> stegru: how to delete + rebuilt the database on windows? it's not using docker
2019-05-17T16:18:27  <cindyli> looking up windows repo readme
2019-05-17T16:19:00  <cindyli> ummâ€¦ not mentioned
2019-05-17T16:21:13  <stegru> i do this:
2019-05-17T16:21:28  <stegru>     rm -rf $universal/build
2019-05-17T16:21:28  <stegru>     pushd /cygdrive/c/Users/vagrant/AppData/Roaming/gpii
2019-05-17T16:21:28  <stegru>     rm -rf 00*.log *.ldb CURRENT LOG* LOCK MANIFE* ../gpii-mrview-e13bcd31bf8a647045b3e1b597b79eb1/ ../pouch__all_dbs__/
2019-05-17T16:21:28  <stegru>     popd
2019-05-17T16:21:47  <stegru> ok, it's not a windows command line, but you get the idea
2019-05-17T16:21:58  <cindyli> trying
2019-05-17T16:32:05  <cindyli> stegru: tried but didn't help. these commands seem to remove interim files. are there other commands being cut off by irc? the last command i can see is "popd". it feels there should be command to repopulate $universal/build and load data into db
2019-05-17T16:32:26  <stegru> pasted 4 lines
2019-05-17T16:32:35  <cindyli> do see 4
2019-05-17T16:33:07  <cindyli> which one in 4 is to rebuild db?
2019-05-17T16:33:32  <stegru> delete directories gpii, pouch__all_dbs__ and gpii-mrview-* that are in c:users/vagrant/appdata/roaming
2019-05-17T16:33:54  <stegru> oh, to rebuild:
2019-05-17T16:33:56  <stegru>     node scripts/convertPrefs.js testData/preferences/ build/dbData/snapset/ snapset
2019-05-17T16:33:57  <stegru>     node scripts/convertPrefs.js testData/preferences/ build/dbData/user/ user
2019-05-17T16:33:57  <stegru>     node scripts/convertPrefs.js tests/data/preferences/ build/tests/dbData/ user
2019-05-17T16:34:00  <stegru> (3 lines)
2019-05-17T16:34:26  <cindyli> then running "node gpii.js" will load converted data into couchdb?
2019-05-17T16:35:12  <stegru> I think so, yes.. I thought you worked on this
2019-05-17T16:36:22  <cindyli> the problem i have is none of the gpii data was loaded into couchdb
2019-05-17T16:40:06  <cindyli> looking into gpii-app repo which seems working fine locally
2019-05-17T16:41:13  <jhernand_> cindyli:
2019-05-17T16:41:15  <stegru> hmm, there used to be something logged
2019-05-17T16:41:16  <jhernand_> npm run dev
2019-05-17T16:41:51  <cindyli> will try it. destroying and rebuilding vm
2019-05-17T16:41:55  <jhernand_> this will use your local couchdb
2019-05-17T16:42:00  <jhernand_> (sorry, was afk)
2019-05-17T16:42:16  <jhernand_> and there's no docker vm on windows
2019-05-17T16:42:36  <jhernand_> we install couchdb on windows as a provisioning step
2019-05-17T16:43:10  <cindyli> jhernand_: "npm run dev" is for starting morphic in gpii-app VM
2019-05-17T16:43:17  <jhernand_> yup
2019-05-17T16:43:33  <cindyli> is there a way to start GPII locally in gpii/windows repo vm
2019-05-17T16:43:34  <jhernand_> with the dev config that runs everything locally
2019-05-17T16:45:29  <jhernand_> yes, vagrant winrm -c 'do.ps1 -c '\''npm run dev'\'''
2019-05-17T16:45:54  <jhernand_> but ctrl+c locally won't make gpii-app to stop in the VM
2019-05-17T16:46:33  <jhernand_> that's why I recommended you just run "npm run dev" inside the VM
2019-05-17T16:47:09  <jhernand_> it's a personal taste
2019-05-17T16:47:28  <jhernand_> I prefer to start from the VM because I can stop it by doing a ctrl+c
2019-05-17T16:47:32  <cindyli> ok, i will use gpii-app vm. we can figure out things with windows repo later. thanks, guys
2019-05-17T16:47:51  <jhernand_> let me know if need any help
2019-05-17T16:48:00  <cindyli> sure
2019-05-17T16:48:00  <jhernand_> I'll be around a bit more
2019-05-17T16:48:05  <cindyli> thanks
