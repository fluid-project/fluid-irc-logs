2020-05-27T15:46:16  <sachin10101998> I was merging infusion with fluid project website and this showed up
2020-05-27T15:47:09  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'm not sure, it might have something to do with your server setup
2020-05-27T15:47:19  <Justin_o> what are the other files that are having issues?

2020-05-27T15:48:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: I meant to ask, the Infusion Reorderer docs I read are on the old docs site, are there any more current docs anywhere? I didn't see any in a PR like with DataSource/Remote Model. Alternatively, have there been any changes since the old docs were last edited?

2020-05-27T15:54:26  <Bosmon> Justin_o, philip__, colinclark - I had just started musing about ES6 proxies again
2020-05-27T15:54:35  <Bosmon> And decided to run through https://jsperf.com/es6-proxy/3
2020-05-27T15:55:08  <Bosmon> Interestingly, proxy access is 35x slower than direct access on Chrome, and 100x slower on Firefox
2020-05-27T15:56:12  <colinclark> what purpose were you think of proxies for?
2020-05-27T15:56:21  <Bosmon> Well, for everything :)
2020-05-27T15:57:04  <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6372
2020-05-27T15:57:37  <Bosmon> It had always seemed that waiting for us to ditch IE11 was the main barrier to such a thing
2020-05-27T15:57:39  <Bosmon> But perhaps it isn't
