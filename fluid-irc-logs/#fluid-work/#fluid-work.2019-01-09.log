2019-01-09T10:00:03  <jhernandez> stegru: morning
2019-01-09T10:00:16  <stegru> hello jhernandez
2019-01-09T10:00:31  <jhernandez> yeah, https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/234 works great
2019-01-09T10:00:35  <jhernandez> :)
2019-01-09T10:00:54  <jhernandez> such a tiny change ...
2019-01-09T10:01:05  <stegru> ah i'm glad about that
2019-01-09T10:01:31  <jhernandez> but yeah, you have to be stegru to think about that tiny change
2019-01-09T10:01:37  <jhernandez> :;
2019-01-09T10:01:40  <jhernandez> ;)
2019-01-09T10:03:51  <jhernandez> can't think of any side effect from applying this
2019-01-09T10:04:38  <stegru> me neither
2019-01-09T10:05:10  <stegru> unless, if high-contrast is already set and there's a custom wallpaper
2019-01-09T10:06:17  <stegru> but I don't think we'll have that - where computers start up in high-contrast
2019-01-09T10:07:05  <jhernandez> right

2019-01-09T10:23:49  <stegru> jhernandez, for the language persists fix, could you a number out of 10 on how much it has fixed? just so I can set gregg's expectations
2019-01-09T10:24:31  <jhernandez> heh
2019-01-09T10:25:37  <jhernandez> as I said to you yesterday, looks like sometimes there's cached stuff as recent matches when searching for an app with cortana and thing like that
2019-01-09T10:26:00  <stegru> yes! I saw that - but only once
2019-01-09T10:26:40  <jhernandez> they stop being shown at some point, not sure exactly when
2019-01-09T10:27:07  <jhernandez> I'd sat it's a 7.5 out of 10
2019-01-09T10:27:23  <jhernandez> including our two fixes
2019-01-09T10:28:09  <jhernandez> however, I'd be more conservative and wait until more people test it
2019-01-09T10:29:03  <stegru> yes, if I say it's fully fixed.. then they might not look hard for the left overs
2019-01-09T10:29:23  <jhernandez> I guess we can't do much about cached stuff, like the news feed and things like that
2019-01-09T10:30:11  <jhernandez> but as far as I can tell, now I am no longer ending up with mixed languages
2019-01-09T10:30:29  <stegru> same here
2019-01-09T10:30:33  <jhernandez> in the way Gregg was experiencing
2019-01-09T10:31:01  <jhernandez> so I'd say that both are "good enough"
2019-01-09T10:31:34  <stegru> not for kavya ;)
2019-01-09T10:31:42  <jhernandez> yeh
2019-01-09T10:31:45  <jhernandez> let's see
2019-01-09T10:32:25  <jhernandez> it's true that I only play around with Hindi, Afrikaans, Spanish and English
2019-01-09T10:33:15  <jhernandez> so not sure if other languages might be causing more problems
2019-01-09T10:33:54  <jhernandez> probably Russian involves more problems because it's ... Russian :P
2019-01-09T10:34:58  <jhernandez> okay, I'll update our 1.0.1 pad with updates
2019-01-09T10:52:02  <jhernandez> Bosmon stegru, I just updated our 1.0.1 pad with the list of things that still need review/merge
2019-01-09T10:52:03  <jhernandez> https://pad.gpii.net/p/morphic-1-0-1-5oa4n0y
2019-01-09T10:52:21  <jhernandez> last updates starting in line 55
2019-01-09T10:52:57  <jhernandez> feel free to add any comment to it
2019-01-09T10:56:57  <stegru> great
2019-01-09T11:15:02  <stegru> jhernandez, I've just spotted a "New installer Bugs  { SG-Priority 0}" in the timeline - is this just the slowness (G1)?
2019-01-09T11:20:54  <jhernandez> do you mean in 1.1? if so, yes, the slowness one in addition to GPII-3608
2019-01-09T11:22:31  <stegru> oh, 1.1.. that's ok
2019-01-09T11:24:04  <Bosmon> stegru, jhernandez - we could have done with a link to the JIRA in a comment on this one - https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/234/files
2019-01-09T11:24:10  <Bosmon> Given the reasoning is a bit obscure
2019-01-09T11:28:35  <stegru> i'll add one
2019-01-09T11:29:00  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, my bad
2019-01-09T11:29:12  <stegru> yes, javi's fault
2019-01-09T11:30:09  <Bosmon> cheers

2019-01-09T13:43:19  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon or anyone else with a bit more history, is there any good reason why tests like this have their test sequence steps in a nested array?

2019-01-09T13:47:38  <the-t-in-rtf> My gut feel was that the previous sequence-munging somehow collapsed these into a single level, but I wanted to make sure there wasn't some secret reason for doing that.
2019-01-09T13:49:45  <the-t-in-rtf> Was it for interoperability with this sequenceSegments concept?

2019-01-09T14:14:21  <simonjb> where do you think a good place might be for such a page?

2019-01-09T14:16:18  <simonjb> thanks
2019-01-09T14:16:43  <Justin_o> simonjb: also, we've been not committing the package-lock files to the git repo lately. it seemed to be causing more issues and didn't seem necessary because we pick specific versions in the package.json file
2019-01-09T14:17:42  <simonjb> Justin_o: it's true that we pick specific versions of dependencies, but those dependencies might not
2019-01-09T14:20:03  <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess as a child of this page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Infusion
2019-01-09T14:20:16  <Justin_o> although i wonder if we should just put it into the Infusion Docs
2019-01-09T14:20:17  <simonjb> my package.json has only 4 dependencies, but the package-lock.json has about 100 versioned dependencies
2019-01-09T14:21:12  <Justin_o> they really grow quite a bit
2019-01-09T14:21:34  <simonjb> Justin_o: let's start in the wiki and then move to Infusion Docs if it seems like a good fit

2019-01-09T14:22:04  <Justin_o> I'm not sure how much it matters to have it or not, just thought I'd mention what we've been doing elsewhere. Bosmon and the-t-in-rtf may have more thoughts on it as I think they ran into the issues.. but can't quite recall
2019-01-09T14:22:23  <simonjb> cool
2019-01-09T14:22:42  <Justin_o> simonjb: sure, we still need to fix the docpad issues anyways
