2018-12-21T13:08:10  <jhernandez> stegru: FYI, I've been playing around with languages
2018-12-21T13:09:25  <jhernandez> and I could more or less reproduce GPII-3558

2018-12-21T13:14:21  <Bosmon> Hi jhernandez - javjarfer[m] - do we want one?
2018-12-21T13:14:56  <jhernandez> if I delete it, the problem goes away - but I don't know how ideal this is
2018-12-21T13:15:13  <jhernandez> Bosmon: not specially, I was asking just in case

2018-12-21T13:16:55  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: that's interesting, in which places does it persist?
2018-12-21T13:16:56  <jhernandez> what I could confirm that works, is what I already commented on GPII-3558 about setting the HKCU\Control Panel\International\User Profile\Languages
2018-12-21T13:17:08  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: see GPII-3558
2018-12-21T13:17:32  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Not on my side, but maybe someone has something that he wants to share
2018-12-21T13:17:42  <jhernandez> what I can't reproduce is the input language thing, not happening on my vm anymore :/
2018-12-21T13:18:37  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: "The windows built-in apps (Calculator, Calendar, etc) from the start menu are shown in Spanish language"
2018-12-21T13:18:54  <javjarfer[m]> have we considered that this have something to do with the special permissions needed for UWP registry keys?
2018-12-21T13:19:07  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: yeah, changing the registry key I just mentioned and restarting the explorer make this go away
2018-12-21T13:19:33  <jhernandez> not a clue about UWP registry keys
2018-12-21T13:21:32  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: looks like that registry key needs the same permissions as the Windows Captions pull
2018-12-21T13:21:36  * javjarfer[m] uploaded an image: image.png (25KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/HVASchfGRuMBxShkQJLYZvLQ >
2018-12-21T13:22:10  <javjarfer[m]> that special permission is now available to set through the registry settings handler using a switch
2018-12-21T13:22:26  <javjarfer[m]> maybe setting the key with the permission in first instance makes the reboot not needed
2018-12-21T13:25:13  <stegru> ok jhernandez
2018-12-21T13:26:49  <jhernandez> stegru: this made the trick about the "built-in apps" thing https://pastebin.com/N1u13Ccx
2018-12-21T13:27:13  <jhernandez> do you want a pr?
2018-12-21T13:28:32  <stegru> yes, ok jhernandez
2018-12-21T13:28:42  <jhernandez> about the uwp keys javjarfer[m] mentions, not a clue about it
2018-12-21T13:29:01  <jhernandez> the problem is that it's hard to reproduce the issue 100%
2018-12-21T13:29:50  <stegru> by the way, gregg has asked about making a language installation thing - possibly in response to the problem you both had yesterday.. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oOTv7xK219yT1-gbQQYLcl7q647BozcJ7bOq293d7C0/edit#heading=h.gonzm190zwuo
2018-12-21T13:30:28  <stegru> I haven't started to reproduce it yet, but I suspect it's a configuration issue
2018-12-21T13:30:31  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: for setting the key with the special permissions you just need to add:
2018-12-21T13:30:32  <javjarfer[m]>  "uwp": "true"
2018-12-21T13:30:32  <javjarfer[m]> to the "options" block of the registrySettingsHandler
2018-12-21T13:30:59  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: is it harmless?
2018-12-21T13:31:10  <jhernandez> I mean, can this be done in every registry key?
2018-12-21T13:31:20  <stegru> javjarfer[m], feel free to update the PR
2018-12-21T13:31:23  <jhernandez> what does it mean?
2018-12-21T13:32:15  <javjarfer[m]> yes, in principle it should be harmless, but I wouldn't do it for every registry key, basically it adds a "group" to the key permissions, which is the group of the "UWP" apps
2018-12-21T13:32:25  <javjarfer[m]> so they can have access to the registry key
2018-12-21T13:33:04  <stegru> hmm
2018-12-21T13:33:36  <stegru> javjarfer[m], would it not be better to make the registry handler detect if it already has that permission? if so, keep it while writing
2018-12-21T13:34:24  <stegru> me and javi aren't in the habbit of checking.. and neither would anyone else
2018-12-21T13:34:28  <stegru> (apart from you)
2018-12-21T13:34:56  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: hahaha I have it after I see something broken, post-mortem check
2018-12-21T13:34:58  <stegru> jhernandez, some registry keys have a special permission that let UWP apps access them
2018-12-21T13:35:31  <javjarfer[m]> it could be a good rewrite, but sometimes, we create keys that didn't existed before, like in the case of the Windows Captions pull
2018-12-21T13:35:45  <stegru> ah, i see
2018-12-21T13:35:56  <javjarfer[m]> in that case, there is no way for that detection to work, so I went with the easiest way for the implementation
2018-12-21T13:36:16  <stegru> so how will we know?
2018-12-21T13:37:08  <javjarfer[m]> Or we check, or we need to have a way to detect if a particular application is a UWP while onboarding it's settings
2018-12-21T13:37:57  <jhernandez> +1 for having something in place that checks for permissions - if it's possible, of course
2018-12-21T13:38:53  <stegru> I wonder if it's safe to say "uwp = true", unless there's an existing key and it doesn't have that permission?
2018-12-21T13:38:55  <jhernandez> ok, here's the pr https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/723
2018-12-21T13:39:32  <jhernandez> regarding the preferredUILanguagesPending ... I'm not sure what to do here
2018-12-21T13:40:18  <jhernandez> since that one is meant to tell windows the language that must be enabled in the next reboot
2018-12-21T13:41:46  <jhernandez> I assume that in a shared PC like in the AJCs or the libraries, we shouldn't run into this problem, since the users shouldn't be allowed to change the OS display language
2018-12-21T13:43:31  <stegru> yes
2018-12-21T13:44:59  <jhernandez> I'm not sure if we (morphic) are triggering this pending registry key to be created
2018-12-21T13:45:25  <jhernandez> I can't tell at this moment, or at least, I didn't see it with a fresh vm
2018-12-21T13:45:32  <stegru> I don't think so
2018-12-21T13:45:42  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_jhe "+1 for having something in place"> I was wondering if we just open the key and write, I think we don't modify any permissions for existing keys true stegru ?
2018-12-21T13:45:53  <javjarfer[m]> That's is worth to verify
2018-12-21T13:46:15  <stegru> the less thinking we need to do, javjarfer[m], the better
2018-12-21T13:46:39  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: that's always the better
2018-12-21T13:46:47  <stegru> if you where not reading our conversation, then we wouldn't have thought about this permission
2018-12-21T13:47:52  <javjarfer[m]> Yes, stalker
2018-12-21T13:48:36  <javjarfer[m]> stalker here*, I agree is not the best option, but how do we guarantee it to be create just for the right ones?
2018-12-21T13:49:17  <javjarfer[m]> I'm going to try to verify if the permission is removed during a simple write operation
2018-12-21T13:49:19  <stegru> would you mind pointing to the part of win32.json on the PR where to put the thing

2018-12-21T14:02:00  <stegru> jhernandez, when you noticed the languages uninstalled - where they also off the list in qss?
2018-12-21T14:02:29  <stegru> and it was every language except english?
2018-12-21T14:03:17  <jhernandez> stegru: good question
2018-12-21T14:03:45  <jhernandez> all the languages were gone from the QSS except English and Afrikaans
2018-12-21T14:04:13  <jhernandez> but Afrikaans is not listed as installed on Windows
2018-12-21T14:04:14  <stegru> what did control panel say?

2018-12-21T14:04:32  <jhernandez> btw
2018-12-21T14:06:03  <jhernandez> I also observed one thing when playing around with the HKCU\Control Panel\International\User Profile\Languages registry key
2018-12-21T14:08:00  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.122.106.129> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2018-12-21T14:08:01  <jhernandez> when I first added the change I submitted in the pr, I was using REG_SZ as the type, when it should be a REG_MULTI_SZ one
2018-12-21T14:08:35  <jhernandez> after setting the language, I could see that a registry key was created in that same path
2018-12-21T14:09:20  <jhernandez> it was called languageListRangeOptOut or something like that
2018-12-21T14:09:30  <stegru> ok
2018-12-21T14:09:44  <jhernandez> which I think that this may trigger windows to restore the profile

2018-12-21T14:10:35  <jhernandez> the pr uses the right type of course, but yeah, I observed that, not sure how relevant it is

2018-12-21T14:11:02  <stegru> by the way, REG_MULTI_SZ is new
2018-12-21T14:11:07  <stegru> new to GPII, that is
2018-12-21T14:11:27  <stegru> it means the value is an array (stored as a c array)
2018-12-21T14:12:04  <jhernandez> I can maybe think that we, at some point, do something weird with one registry key and windows detects that and triggers something to resolve this "conflict" and restores the language profile
2018-12-21T14:12:15  <stegru> hmm maybe
2018-12-21T14:12:24  <jhernandez> dunno
2018-12-21T14:12:55  <jhernandez> it's just an speculation
2018-12-21T14:13:49  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, I missed that REG_MULTI_SZ that I remember it wasn't there a few months ago
2018-12-21T14:14:07  <jhernandez> and yesterday I night found it on a test
2018-12-21T14:14:18  <jhernandez> :)

2018-12-21T14:15:31  <stegru> actually, you are the first to use it - I added it for the language detection, until you found a the better location

2018-12-21T16:46:39  <gmoss> clown cindyli1 nobody was in the room when I joined, so I left hah.. caffeine time. If it didn't end up happening, I don't mind doing a standup at any time later today
2018-12-21T16:47:08  <clown> gmoss, it happened.
2018-12-21T16:47:57  <clown> we waited until about 11:35, but there were only three of us (colin, jhung, and myself), so it went pretty quick

2018-12-21T16:54:04  <gmoss> clown: looks like I just missed it. Ah well! Might as well give a little update: yesterday I worked on integrating Justin's FLUID-6303 work back into the storytelling tool but hit a small snag, so I switched to SJRK-27 and aged more tests for the video/time-based block grades. Discovered that Chrome and Firefox block autoplay for video and audio elements without prior user interaction, which threw a wrench into my tests
2018-12-21T16:54:26  <gmoss> Going to keep working on those two items today

2018-12-21T17:51:33  <stegru> ok jhernandez
2018-12-21T17:51:59  <jhernandez> stegru: hey, now that you're around
2018-12-21T17:52:15  <stegru> yes?
2018-12-21T17:52:27  <jhernandez> I left you some clues on the highContrast thing not restoring the right wallpaper
2018-12-21T17:52:57  <jhernandez> they are in the doc, as a comment of K2
2018-12-21T17:53:58  <jhernandez> hope they ring a bell ...
2018-12-21T17:54:01  <jhernandez> :)
2018-12-21T17:57:07  <stegru> ok, 1: "restore" restores to how the system was before morphic was started
2018-12-21T17:57:55  <stegru> 2: oh.. actually, it always restores to the default one
2018-12-21T17:59:36  <stegru> ok, jhernandez, I think it's because the high-contrast gets turned off even if it's already off
2018-12-21T18:02:08  <jhernandez> do you mean, it passes twice?
2018-12-21T18:02:09  <stegru> when we turn it on.. the background is saved, and restored upon key-out
2018-12-21T18:02:40  <stegru> not twice.. just once, but it doesn't need to be turn off
2018-12-21T18:03:07  <stegru> when we turn it off at key-out, the background was saved at key-in
2018-12-21T18:03:18  <stegru> but, when it's turned off via reset, there was no background saved
2018-12-21T18:03:35  <stegru> (I'm guessing)
2018-12-21T18:05:51  <jhernandez> okay, got it
2018-12-21T18:06:36  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4861
2018-12-21T18:20:48  <clown> gmoss, back from lunch and just noticed the aged vs added comment.  :-)
2018-12-21T18:26:29  <jhernandez> stegru: hmm, I'm not sure about the order of the actions in the configure and restore blocks
2018-12-21T18:27:20  <jhernandez> I mean, I'm sure the order matters
2018-12-21T18:27:47  <jhernandez> gotta leave

2018-12-21T18:35:14  <colinclark> gmoss: https://github.com/colinbdclark/aconite/blob/master/src/video.js#L191-L209
2018-12-21T18:35:31  <colinclark> In Aconite, I defer playback until the video is guaranteed to be able to play right through
2018-12-21T18:35:45  <colinclark> but this is due to the nature of itâ€”for glitch-free live video
2018-12-21T18:35:52  <colinclark> you'll want "canplay," I believe
2018-12-21T18:36:28  <gmoss> colinclark: that's very helpful. I was binding listeners to "loadeddata", "play" and "ended", so i'll swap out loadeddata for canplay.
2018-12-21T18:36:50  <colinclark> https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/video.html#mediaevents
2018-12-21T18:36:50  <gmoss> as you suspected, loadeddata fires when the first frame is loaded, so it's not necessarily a good representation of what i was going for: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Media_events
2018-12-21T18:36:54  <gmoss> :)
2018-12-21T18:37:03  <colinclark> yup
2018-12-21T18:37:17  <colinclark> it's very earlyâ€”good enough to do stuff if you've got logic related to, say showing a poster frame or something
2018-12-21T18:37:20  <colinclark> but not enough for playback
2018-12-21T18:37:35  <gmoss> mhmm

2018-12-21T18:37:39  <colinclark> if you want to know when the browser can play fully without stopping partway, it's "canplaythrough"
2018-12-21T18:37:55  <gmoss> I think for my needs, "canplay" is what i'm looking for
2018-12-21T18:37:58  <gmoss> since videos may be large
2018-12-21T18:38:07  <gmoss> and connections may be slow
2018-12-21T18:39:21  <gmoss> colinclark: do you think i should scrap my "play" invoker altogether? since it won't really be useful to anyone
2018-12-21T18:39:46  <gmoss> i'll leave the events
2018-12-21T18:39:47  <colinclark> Personally, I'd leave it
2018-12-21T18:39:49  <gmoss> okay
2018-12-21T18:39:54  <colinclark> It's a reasonable thing for a video component to be able to do
2018-12-21T18:40:18  <colinclark> it's just the sort of thing that should only be invoked as the result of a user action :)
2018-12-21T18:40:20  <colinclark> sadly
2018-12-21T18:40:21  <gmoss> agreed, I just wonder if it will be usable without user interaction
2018-12-21T18:40:23  <gmoss> mhmm
2018-12-21T18:40:28  <colinclark> I mean, I guess it's not sad
2018-12-21T18:40:33  <colinclark> i hate autoplaying videos
2018-12-21T18:40:42  <colinclark> but does make integration testing harder
2018-12-21T18:40:58  <gmoss> indeed
