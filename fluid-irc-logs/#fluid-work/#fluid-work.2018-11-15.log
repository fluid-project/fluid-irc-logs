2018-11-15T14:04:43  <Justin_o> alanharnum, cindyli: do you mind if we push our meeting back to about 10:45 instead of 10:30. I had thought my other meeting was starting earlier.
2018-11-15T14:07:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i need to use these patterns for hypher. However, this repo isn't published to NPM and doesn't come with a package.json file. https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns
2018-11-15T14:08:57  <Justin_o> I've temporarily forked it and put in a package.json file in my own repo space so that I can work on developing with it, but am getting close to being ready to submit a PR. Should I fork this to the fluid-project space, if so, should i publish it to NPM or pull in from a git endpoint.
2018-11-15T14:10:19  <Bosmon> Justin_o - do publish it to npm as a scoped package
2018-11-15T14:10:33  <Bosmon> git-based dependencies just cause too many problems for npm in the long run
2018-11-15T14:10:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, what should i call it.. fluid-hyphenation-patterns?
2018-11-15T14:11:15  <Justin_o> i figure i should leave the original name in case he decides to publish it himself later
2018-11-15T14:11:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the idea with scoped packages on npm is that you can use the original name without taking up the one in the global namespace
2018-11-15T14:11:45  <Bosmon> https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope
2018-11-15T14:11:55  <Justin_o> i don't think i've heard of that before, thanks for sharing
2018-11-15T14:12:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it's a standard approach that the-t-in-rtf and I have been using for a while for the numerous packages we have had to fork
2018-11-15T14:13:27  <cindyli> Justin_o, alanharnum, i'm fine with 10:45
2018-11-15T14:13:36  <the-t-in-rtf> IMO if we do it again we should be using @fluid-project instead of individual accounts
2018-11-15T14:13:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I think the pouch-express one I made is @the-t-in-rtf
2018-11-15T14:14:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume that's possible.
2018-11-15T14:14:32  <the-t-in-rtf> (using the shared account)
2018-11-15T14:15:18  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon: i don't quite see how you identify a scope when you publish
2018-11-15T14:15:37  <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec, I will share an example
2018-11-15T14:15:40  <Justin_o> thanks
2018-11-15T14:16:29  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/pouchdb-all-dbs/blob/master/package.json#L2
2018-11-15T14:16:40  <the-t-in-rtf> Literally all I did in my fork was change the name in the package.json
2018-11-15T14:16:41  <alanharnum> Justin_o cindy_li: sure, that's fine
2018-11-15T14:16:46  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean to get the scoped name
2018-11-15T14:16:51  <the-t-in-rtf> there are other code changes, but you get the idea
2018-11-15T14:16:55  <Justin_o> ah okay, that's easy.. i was looking for a command line flag or something
2018-11-15T14:18:24  <the-t-in-rtf> There probably is one, but the advantage here is that the scope is part of the reviewed codebase.
2018-11-15T14:18:51  <the-t-in-rtf> there is the chance that someone encountering the work later can understand what you've done
2018-11-15T14:19:03  <the-t-in-rtf> in my case that person is often me a couple weeks or months later... ;)
2018-11-15T14:20:42  <Justin_o> haha yah... i hate it when i go back to my work and realize that the docs weren't as good as i thought they were at the time

2018-11-15T19:07:22  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - so BryanYoung2 was saying that he might be ready to start looking at the system in a bit more detail
2018-11-15T19:07:51  <Bosmon> I was thinking perhaps he could follow along some of your recent work to get an idea of what are current issues
2018-11-15T19:08:28  <Bosmon> I guess https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/708/files for GPII-3434 is a somewhat interesting one, currently under review
2018-11-15T19:09:09  <Bosmon> For a more bite-sized and self-contained piece of work there is https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/699 which is perhaps a better starting point
2018-11-15T19:09:34  <Bosmon> BryanYoung2 - why don't you take a look at these diffs and see if you can get a sense of what is going on, and then perhaps come back with some questions or requests for pointers to docs
2018-11-15T19:09:47  <Bosmon> And of course any review comments are welcome too

2018-11-15T20:30:55  <stegru> Bosmon, what's your view of using settings handles via code? (y/n)
2018-11-15T20:31:10  <Bosmon> stegru - dunno what you mean
2018-11-15T20:31:56  <stegru> like, passing a payload into .setImpl() - are settings handlers just for the solutions registry?
2018-11-15T20:33:58  <Bosmon> Well I dunno, you can do what you like : P
2018-11-15T20:34:00  <Bosmon> What's the use case?
2018-11-15T20:35:04  <stegru> not sure, I'm reviewing windows 197
2018-11-15T20:36:10  <stegru> I just feel payloads belong on the SR, especially static ones
2018-11-15T20:36:12  <Bosmon> No point reviewing it until he addresses the existing 3 month old feedback : P
2018-11-15T20:36:16  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] ^^
2018-11-15T20:37:17  <Bosmon> Well, you're right, this is all a bit of a hotchpotch
2018-11-15T20:37:39  <stegru> well, i'm trying to avoid debugging some windows theme problem :)
2018-11-15T20:39:23  <Bosmon> Where is the line where he invokes a settings handler manually?

2018-11-15T21:32:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the scoped npm packages. have you done an initial publish as a dev release
2018-11-15T21:32:59  <Justin_o> i seem to be having some problems getting it to work with fluid-publish and that is even with specifying the publishDevCmd option to include the "--access public" flag.

2018-11-15T21:55:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i figured it out. I needed to escape the $ using \ for the token in the publishDevCmd
2018-11-15T21:55:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - great discovery
2018-11-15T21:55:27  <Bosmon> What kind of expansion was the $ being exposed to?
2018-11-15T21:56:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think it's only an issue when overriding the command via command line. The publishDevCmd defaults to "npm publish --tag ${devTag}"
2018-11-15T21:57:06  <Justin_o> which gets replaced by    dev
2018-11-15T21:57:26  <Bosmon> Ah

2018-11-15T21:57:37  <Bosmon> I think that IRC itself mangled that through some kind of substitution :)
2018-11-15T21:57:37  <Justin_o> In my override i wanted to just append "--access public" for the initial publishing of the scoped package
2018-11-15T21:57:59  <Justin_o> really :(

2018-11-15T22:01:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's another question.. regarding npm.. so i published it, but it won't let me pull it down.. i think the issue is with the licence specified.. in the original repo it just had "LGPL" but that's not valid SPDX license code
2018-11-15T22:01:28  <Bosmon> ?!
2018-11-15T22:01:31  <Justin_o> the problem is that i don't know which version of LGPL it is
2018-11-15T22:01:41  <Bosmon> It may be just a propagation delay
2018-11-15T22:01:52  <Bosmon> I don't think that the npm transport really cares about licences
2018-11-15T22:01:54  <Justin_o> it says the package.json file doesn't exist
2018-11-15T22:02:01  <Bosmon> wow
2018-11-15T22:02:23  <Justin_o> i think i had a similar issue when i was doing this with the github endpoint before.. but i forget about it
2018-11-15T22:02:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the error message "Could not install from "@fluid-project/hyphenation-patterns@0.2.2-dev.20181115T211247Z.d313a52" as it does not contain a package.json file."
2018-11-15T22:02:55  <Justin_o> i'm guessing it's failing some validation, although I expected that it would have validated the package file before it let me publish
2018-11-15T22:03:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yet amazingly it is up on npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluid-project/hyphenation-patterns
2018-11-15T22:04:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the original repo https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns. You can see in the README it just says LGPL (unless otherwise noted)
2018-11-15T22:06:47  <Bosmon> Yes
2018-11-15T22:06:54  <Bosmon> I managed to download the latest tarball and extract it
2018-11-15T22:06:59  <Bosmon> There is definitely a package.json in there

2018-11-15T22:08:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for verifying that
2018-11-15T22:10:09  <Bosmon> I think what you could infer from "LGPL" is reasonably LGPL-2.1-or-later
2018-11-15T22:10:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: rather unusual situation eh.. i wonder if i should just guess at which version of LGPL it is. I'm assuming that this repo got licensed as LGLP because of this pattern https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns/blob/master/patterns/be.js which also doesn't specify which version it is
2018-11-15T22:11:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, related to your previous question the other day about using a different pattern file.. we could convert the ones from here https://ctan.org/pkg/hyph-utf8
2018-11-15T22:11:54  <Justin_o> specifically this portion of the repo https://github.com/hyphenation/tex-hyphen/tree/master/hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/tex
2018-11-15T22:11:56  <Bosmon> cool
2018-11-15T22:12:12  <Bosmon> I imagine it will be a low priority compared to just getting the thing working in a way that looks acceptable
2018-11-15T22:12:14  <Justin_o> at least one of these was used to create a pattern that hypher uses.
2018-11-15T22:12:37  <Bosmon> On a related note, I was starting to get concerned about introducing a new core dependency to Infusion and thinking that this rather increases our urgency in thinking about modularisation
2018-11-15T22:13:00  <Justin_o> yep.. i looked into it a bit and ended up with the same results for the en-US anyways.. so it would probably just buy us updates, clearer license, and more languages..
2018-11-15T22:13:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah.. well at least these are all pulled in via NPM now
2018-11-15T22:13:52  <Justin_o> and i'm not going to include the pattern files in the infusion-all
2018-11-15T22:14:06  <Bosmon> How will they get loaded
2018-11-15T22:14:36  <Justin_o> the syllabification enactor lazy loads them.. or you could manually load it in yourself
2018-11-15T22:15:04  <Justin_o> the integrator would have to specify a path for at init similar to what we do for the templates and etc.
