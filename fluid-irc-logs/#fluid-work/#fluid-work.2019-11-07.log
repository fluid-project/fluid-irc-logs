2019-11-07T13:39:43  <Bosmon> I need to understand why we have all these new distributions though

2019-11-07T13:42:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: regarding the distributions, it used to be that you would provide an auxiliarySchema directly to the builder for any necessary overrides.. typically for setting the terms. Actually it was the builders own auxiliarySchema option that you were setting before, and the other auxiliary schema wrapping grades just merged onto of this
2019-11-07T13:43:24  <Justin_o> the underlying part is the same, but it seemed strange to provide an auxiliary schema in fluid.prefs.create, plus a list of schema grades

2019-11-07T16:25:55  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - given you currently have the prefs framework loaded into your mind, I wondered if I could assign you a small task : P
2019-11-07T16:26:20  <Bosmon> I'd thought a useful next step, given that we are having to rewrite a lot of stuff to upgrade it, might be to go to implementing FLUID-6145 immediately and make all component options immutable
2019-11-07T16:26:48  <Bosmon> I found this surprisingly a bit easier than I'd feared and there only seem to be a couple of black spots in the framework after I cleared a few sites where it surreptitiously manages to mutate its own options ....
2019-11-07T16:27:00  <Bosmon> One of them is https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6426 which I wonder if I could assign to you
2019-11-07T16:27:08  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@rrcs-172-254-237-202.nyc.biz.rr.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-11-07T16:27:24  <Bosmon> You can see the problem easily if you check out https://github.com/amb26/infusion/tree/FLUID-6145 and try to run BuilderTests.js or indeed anything which tries to render a prefs panel
2019-11-07T16:27:47  *** cindyli1 <cindyli1!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-11-07T16:27:53  <Bosmon> I think this will make a good improvement in reliability anyway since the few sites I found where this happened were in practice just bugs waiting to happen
2019-11-07T16:28:27  <Bosmon> And this is an important stepping stone to implementing the INFUSION COMPILER which will be essential to get any acceptable performance out of the framework ...
2019-11-07T16:28:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, I can take a look at that.. I take it this should be done prior to my FLUID-6420 PR being merged?
2019-11-07T16:30:03  <Bosmon> Justin_o - Ok well let me look at how much of a train wreck FLUID-6420 leaves if I merge it into FLUID-6148 : P
2019-11-07T16:30:24  <Bosmon> I see that cindy merged FLUID-6422 yesterday so I can at least roll you a new release of FLUID-6148 to test against now
2019-11-07T16:31:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that would be helpful, as I'd like to update UIO+ and put out another beta release
2019-11-07T16:35:11  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, great news, FLUID-6420 actually merges surprisingly cleanly except for some of the HTML drivers for the examples and the only test failures are in BuilderTests.js which look fairly minor
2019-11-07T16:35:22  <Bosmon> But let me deal with FLUID-6422 first
2019-11-07T16:38:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2019-11-07T16:43:15  <Bosmon> Justin_o - actually one of the BuilderTests.js failures is not so clear after all
2019-11-07T16:43:26  <Justin_o> :(
2019-11-07T16:43:34  <Bosmon> For some reason the fluid.prefs.create tests all fail for reasons I'm not really clear about
2019-11-07T16:43:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it's probably because of the grade name look up
2019-11-07T16:44:07  <Bosmon> But basically there is no prefs editor at all for some reason
2019-11-07T16:44:17  <Bosmon> I will need to refresh my memory on what "fluid.prefs.assembler.prefsEd" actually is .......
2019-11-07T16:44:17  <Justin_o> oh
2019-11-07T16:44:33  <Justin_o> it's the assembled prefs editor grade
2019-11-07T16:45:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if I'm remembering correctly ;) Part of the problem with the current state of the prefs editor is that there are many levels, and so many things called prefs editor or similar
2019-11-07T16:46:17  <Bosmon> Yes
2019-11-07T16:46:24  <Bosmon> We should certainly abolish this in the new version : P
2019-11-07T16:49:45  <Justin_o> definitely
2019-11-07T16:49:49  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, new FLUID-6148 release based on current master is up: 3.0.0-dev.20191107T164711Z.332e92c33.FLUID-6148
2019-11-07T16:50:25  <Bosmon> This one features LENSED SELF-RENDERING!
2019-11-07T16:50:26  <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCViewTests.js#L200
2019-11-07T16:50:49  <Bosmon> I tidied up the old "fluid.containerRenderingView" grade we used to have to make it suitable for the new world
2019-11-07T16:55:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: excellent!!
2019-11-07T16:56:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you have time to look at FLUID-6421, I left some comments on the JIRA. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to handle the self rendering of the panels into the prefs editor.
2019-11-07T16:56:45  *** yzen <yzen!~yzen@2620:101:80f2:224:807f:9965:b000:be8e> has quit IRC (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2019-11-07T16:57:00  <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh yes, thanks, I knew you had added some notes for me to look at somewhere
2019-11-07T16:59:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6421
2019-11-07T17:00:08  <Bosmon> Yes, puzzling over it now ...
2019-11-07T17:00:37  <Bosmon> the FullPreviewPrefsEditor.html is pretty tough, isnt' it
2019-11-07T17:00:45  <Bosmon> This is exactly the flexibility we wanted to give integrators
2019-11-07T17:01:40  <Justin_o> yes
2019-11-07T17:02:46  <Justin_o> with the self rendering, even if we require sections for containers, the configuration gets harder
2019-11-07T17:03:52  <Bosmon> My current suggestion is that we could do something even simpler than 1a) and enable, via a new top-level configuration option, an extremely rudimentary renderer which bashes the HTML together for a template exactly of the kinds we already have via some string-bashing
2019-11-07T17:05:24  <Bosmon> It would accept as its raw materials a "template template" of exactly the form of the outside of https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/html/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.html only with the interior represented by %panels which it then interpolates via repeated use of fluid.stringTemplate, and a further option indicating what tag it generates, which
2019-11-07T17:05:24  <Bosmon> defaults to "li"
2019-11-07T17:07:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: what about this example where there are different styling classes applied to each as well https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/html/FullNoPreviewPrefsEditor.html
2019-11-07T17:08:10  <Bosmon> Justin_o - we wouldn't support generating a template of that kind automatically
2019-11-07T17:08:14  <Justin_o> I'm not entirely clear how necessary they are for that example, but I guess that might be a use case for others
2019-11-07T17:08:18  <Bosmon> If the user wants that kind of template they can supply it by hand
2019-11-07T17:09:13  <Bosmon> Our main use case is reducing pain points such as waharnum's who would say, "In order to simply add a new panel to the system I always need to touch the configuration in 6 places"
2019-11-07T17:10:04  <Bosmon> We want to deliver an "out of the box" configuration which is as far as possible totally automated, and then supply options which branch off from there which allow them to take control of different parts of the process if needed
2019-11-07T17:10:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so the template template is still an html file? and we serialize it to use string template with it?

2019-11-07T21:40:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: is there a demo of the storytelling tool?
2019-11-07T21:40:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: yep, people can use the staging site which resets itself every 24hrs
2019-11-07T21:40:39  <gmoss> https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/
2019-11-07T21:40:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: excellent thanks

2019-11-07T21:41:05  <Justin_o> gmoss: are we still good to do the Design Crit on Tuesday related to the story telling tool?
2019-11-07T21:41:14  <Justin_o> someone is planning on joining
2019-11-07T21:41:25  <gmoss> Justin_o: np! btw this builds from the dev branch, so it could potentially be buggy (we try to avoid this in the review process, of course)
2019-11-07T21:41:47  <gmoss> Justin_o: yep, still good!
2019-11-07T21:42:42  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks.. np.. I'm just passing this along so that the person can try it out ahead of the meeting
2019-11-07T21:46:16  <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good :) thanks for the heads-up!
2019-11-07T21:46:25  <gmoss> if they have any trouble, feel free to reach out
2019-11-07T21:46:41  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, I'll let you know if they mention anything.

2019-11-07T23:08:45  <Bosmon> Justin_o - interesting that jQuery appear to have managed to make yet another compatibility breaking update in what should have been a minor update
2019-11-07T23:09:09  <Bosmon> It probably is about time we set about removing jQuery from our dependencies : P
2019-11-07T23:15:20  <Justin_o> really... what did they break?
2019-11-07T23:16:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, I guess we can get by fairly well without it at this point. We'll probably want to decide what to do with the keyboard a11y stuff though
2019-11-07T23:16:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I wonder if we need to drop IE 11 though.. not sure what its support for querying the DOM is like
2019-11-07T23:16:59  <Justin_o> but I'm hoping we can drop IE 11 after the new Edge is released in January
2019-11-07T23:17:05  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/965
2019-11-07T23:17:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sounds good
2019-11-07T23:19:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting that it's the keyboard a11y tests that are failing
2019-11-07T23:31:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I published a new beta of UIO+ but because of the permissions it uses, it now needs to be reviewed. It is pending review before the publish will be complete. Hopefully it goes through okay.
