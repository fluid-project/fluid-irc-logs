2019-07-09T15:46:43  <cindyli> ok. good to know. if so, we need to change the data migration script too: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/migration/migration-GPII-3711.js#L41-L46
2019-07-09T15:46:54  <yanachkov__> Yup just started looking on it.
2019-07-09T15:47:11  <jhernandez> cindyli: yes
2019-07-09T15:47:26  <jhernandez> hmm, I'd say we also need highContrastTheme to be included in that list
2019-07-09T15:47:30  <yanachkov__> Do you have on your build reset to standart logic, because I see on pulls is not merged?
2019-07-09T15:47:48  <stegru> well, the settings handler doesn't detect which value the ribbon should be - so I don't think you'll get far with it, yzen

2019-07-09T18:50:47  <the-t-in-rtf1> Antranig also requested that I find something with better stemming, so the new version will use lunr.js and "references" won't also match "preferences".

2019-07-09T20:16:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i'm travelling through time, trying to catch up to the present as I read through months worth of e-mails. I'm seeing this JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6372 where you mention the market share for IE 11 and use that as a basis for suggesting that we can ditch support for it when the feature being worked on is ready. I'm wondering a couple things 1) where did you obtain those statistics, could you
2019-07-09T20:16:55  <Justin_o> add a link for future reference. 2) Have we considered how we'll support old legacy systems that want to deploy our code. I believe we ran into some issues with that on some of our projects.

2019-07-09T20:19:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  in general I'm interested in moving off support for IE 11 and to only latest browsers. We are being held back both in terms of JS and CSS. However, I think we need to understand potential negative impacts of such a decision and if there are ways to mitigate them without causing undo overhead.
