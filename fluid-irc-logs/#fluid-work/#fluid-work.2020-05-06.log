2020-05-06T14:37:17  <clown> Justin_o:   no problem.
2020-05-06T14:37:33  <clown> Justin_o:  a question about GPII-4218…
2020-05-06T14:38:00  <Justin_o> clown: sure
2020-05-06T14:38:01  <clown> You've added an item to the arch meeting agenda about it, and say this is relevant to the BrowserChannel.
2020-05-06T14:38:10  <Justin_o> yes
2020-05-06T14:38:11  <clown> But, the JIRA says it's about the PSPChannel.
2020-05-06T14:38:25  <Justin_o> we might need cindyli to clarify that part.
2020-05-06T14:38:29  <clown> Is it because they are both based on websockets?
2020-05-06T14:38:54  <cindyli> checking..
2020-05-06T14:38:59  <Justin_o> I'm not sure, exactly.. UIO+ only communicates over the Browser Channel
2020-05-06T14:39:26  <clown> I'm even less sure.  :-)
2020-05-06T14:41:38  <clown> and, thank you for chaning your colour in the pirate pad, Justin_o
2020-05-06T14:41:42  <clown> *changin
2020-05-06T14:41:46  <clown> *changinG
2020-05-06T14:43:48  <cindyli> clown, Justin_o: GPII-4218 is related to both. PSPChannel is used by gpii-app to communicate between the Morphic front end (gpii-app) with LFM. one PSPChannel API that gpii-app uses is to read settings. one of these settings is UIO+ settings. PSPChannel calls get() method provided by UIO+ solution to read and it doesn't care how get() is implemented by UIO+. in fact, UIO+ is using browser channel to communicate with LFM for get() and
2020-05-06T14:43:48  <cindyli>  set()
2020-05-06T14:44:13  <cindyli> so both PSPChannel and browser channel are involved but for different aspects
2020-05-06T14:45:02  <Justin_o> clown: I think from what cindyli and I looked at before, the communication from PSPChannel to BrowserChannel is setup to work already
2020-05-06T14:45:11  <Justin_o> if I'm not mistaken
2020-05-06T14:46:41  <clown> yes, it sounds like it:  UIO+ gives PSPChannel a get() "spec".  That "get" spec is actually implemented using the BrowserChannel.  That may be a really naive rough way of putting it.
