2020-01-07T18:04:32  <greatislander> Teddy_ there is no meeting scheduled yet, I'll keep you posted
2020-01-07T18:05:15  <Teddy_> Okay thank you
2020-01-07T18:06:56  <greatislander> Teddy_ are you able to add me to your Netlify test deploy? If you go under Settings -> General -> Site members on Netlify
2020-01-07T18:07:03  <greatislander> Using my OCAD email
2020-01-07T18:10:36  <Teddy_> it says
2020-01-07T18:10:37  <Teddy_> Inviting 1 new member will add 1 extra seat at $15/month to your monthly bill.
2020-01-07T18:11:19  <Teddy_> So it will bill my account when adding new members
2020-01-07T18:20:50  <greatislander> Okay never mind
2020-01-07T18:21:11  <greatislander> Teddy_ can you merge the latest upstream commit from your local upstream branch into nuxt_poc?
2020-01-07T18:21:15  <greatislander> To do so:
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> ```
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> git checkout upstream
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> git pull
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> git checkout nuxt_poc
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> git merge upstream
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> git push
2020-01-07T18:21:40  <greatislander> ```
2020-01-07T18:21:45  <greatislander> Thanks in advance!
2020-01-07T18:30:10  <Teddy_> I got this error
2020-01-07T18:30:20  <Teddy_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/mxKE45ef/
2020-01-07T18:30:43  <Teddy_> even tried setting the upstream first
2020-01-07T18:31:01  <michelled> Teddy_: we often create a remote in our git repos where 'upstream' is the project repo
2020-01-07T18:31:13  <michelled> how did you try to set upstream?
2020-01-07T18:31:34  <Teddy_> `git push --set-upstream origin nuxt_poc`
2020-01-07T18:31:47  <greatislander> Teddy_ I thought we'd set up the upstream branch

2020-01-07T19:51:50  <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli : For the user account (ie. username/passwords along keys) do we anything even close to a definitive document that lists what operations can be performed either: anonymously, key-ed, or fully logged in?

2020-01-07T21:19:32  <Teddy_> Loading page, initial title page? or maybe theres a way to have it loaded already
2020-01-07T21:25:01  <greatislander> Teddy_ have you had any luck researching this?
2020-01-07T21:25:18  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-01-07T21:26:03  <Teddy_> Yeah I think there may be a solution using lifecycle methods
2020-01-07T21:26:20  <greatislander> This seems like it might be relevant https://vueschool.io/courses/static-site-generation-with-nuxtjs?friend=nuxt
2020-01-07T21:26:22  <Teddy_> particularly `beforeMount`
2020-01-07T21:26:45  <greatislander> I don't think that will help
2020-01-07T21:27:32  <greatislander> Well, maybe?
2020-01-07T21:28:14  <greatislander> But I think if there's any way you can load the data for those pages when generating the static site that's probably better.
2020-01-07T21:28:25  <greatislander> Rather than loading a blank page in the client and then fetching data from the API
2020-01-07T21:28:34  <greatislander> That's just my instinct though
2020-01-07T21:29:09  <greatislander> I think this should be used for all the pages if it isn't already https://nuxtjs.org/guide/async-data
2020-01-07T21:29:50  <greatislander> (Caveat to all of this is that I haven't reviewed your PR yet so I'm not sure about what you're doing)
2020-01-07T21:32:32  <Teddy_> Haven't tried those yet. checking them out
2020-01-07T21:33:25  <Teddy_> i'll try asyncData then the material on the course
