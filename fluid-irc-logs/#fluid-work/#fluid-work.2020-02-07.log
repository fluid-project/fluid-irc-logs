2020-02-07T13:39:19  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, I need to componentise the contexts in the SR so that I can filter the whole range of solutions down to Windows, et cetera
2020-02-07T13:39:30  <the-t-in-rtf> quick question about things like UiO+
2020-02-07T13:40:01  <the-t-in-rtf> (digging up a link for context, just a sec)
2020-02-07T13:40:22  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L12411
2020-02-07T13:40:41  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/linux.json5#L1461
2020-02-07T13:40:57  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/web.json5#L4
2020-02-07T13:41:48  <the-t-in-rtf> If the solution is configured in the same way on all three, I was thinking we should have multiple OS entries.
2020-02-07T13:42:00  <the-t-in-rtf> my question is twofold
2020-02-07T13:42:19  <the-t-in-rtf> can we meaningfully interpret multiple entries in that array?
2020-02-07T13:42:28  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-07T13:42:45  <the-t-in-rtf> and 2) can I transition that to be a hash to improve options merging?
2020-02-07T13:43:16  <the-t-in-rtf> or is that OS information just ignored and really the filename does all the context filtering at the moment

2020-02-07T13:54:02  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - be aware that a central issue here is filed as https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1256
2020-02-07T13:54:19  <Bosmon> ON which Javi's most recent comment is "This work should be achieved at some point after Tony's done with his solutions registry work." : P
2020-02-07T13:54:33  <Bosmon> I believe that the OS information is currently ignored, which is why we duplicate the solution everywhere
2020-02-07T13:55:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm modeling it as a series of marker grades, one for each OS, that only contain the context definition
2020-02-07T13:57:47  <Bosmon> ok
2020-02-07T13:58:09  <the-t-in-rtf> seems fine to me to leave it there for the future but go ahead and map-ise it
2020-02-07T14:00:47  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks

2020-02-07T14:38:29  <the-t-in-rtf> There are some very detailed windows contexts, like >5.0 in a lot of places, >6.2 in at least one
2020-02-07T14:38:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I am very much assuming that's just aspirational, and not actually meaningful
2020-02-07T14:39:14  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. we intended to support multiple verisons of operating systems in our vision, but nothing enforces that
2020-02-07T14:39:26  <the-t-in-rtf> nor do we test on anything other than our current target platform
2020-02-07T14:39:48  <the-t-in-rtf> I was planning to unify all the windows contexts for now

2020-02-07T15:02:43  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I've made a first pass at converting the entire legacy registry to the new JSON5 structure
2020-02-07T15:03:02  <the-t-in-rtf> The legacy data has 911,669 characters
2020-02-07T15:03:09  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@lnsm3-torontoxn-142-116-177-193.internet.virginmobile.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-07T15:03:27  <the-t-in-rtf> With proper inheritance of basic stuff like contexts, that's down to 597,181 characters
2020-02-07T15:04:38  <the-t-in-rtf> Lots of that comes from things like the JAWS true/false settings, which all inherit much of their schema from a base grade
2020-02-07T15:05:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I will look for other similar savings for a bit and then work on the thing that generates the legacy files from the "live" solutions registry
2020-02-07T15:06:12  <the-t-in-rtf> See, this is fun, I can just reuse that grade in MAGic as well
