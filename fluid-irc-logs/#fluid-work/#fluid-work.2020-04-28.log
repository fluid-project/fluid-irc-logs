2020-04-28T16:15:07  <colinclark_> cindyli1, Bosmon, Bosmon3, clown, michelled all seem like good options

2020-04-28T16:34:46  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I'm just looking at https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus/pull/5 and it seems some odd option is enabled on the repository which makes ordinary merges not possible via the UI?
2020-04-28T16:38:20  *** kasparnet <kasparnet!~kasper2@192038135118.mbb.telenor.dk> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-28T16:38:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, I've set that up to do squash merges.. Here's my reasoning for that. 1) Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues 2) we are using the conventional commits ( https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ ) for commit logs. It's harder to track which each individual commit relates to which issue. Squashing will group them all together
2020-04-28T16:40:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: what do you think?
2020-04-28T16:46:22  <Bosmon> Justin_o - what happened to our existing community standards for commit messages, where they got prefixed with a JIRA number? : P
2020-04-28T16:46:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: there is no JIRA number, uio-plus uses GitHub issues
2020-04-28T16:49:47  <colinclark> sweet, sweet github issues
2020-04-28T16:49:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I probably don't have time to review at this moment how this might impact things we have historically depended on
2020-04-28T16:50:04  <Bosmon> For example, with the following pull: https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus/pull/8
2020-04-28T16:50:26  <Bosmon> You have 21 commits which are a variety of "fix", "docs" and "build"
2020-04-28T16:50:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you mean the commit logs or that change in general
2020-04-28T16:50:41  <Bosmon> What sense would it make for these to be squashed into a single commit, and what "conventional" notation would that end up with?
2020-04-28T16:51:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: well that does include changes from 3 other PRs, but I needed them in that one so that I can continue working. I think the other PRs should be merged independently first
2020-04-28T16:51:26  <Bosmon> And once someone had had this merged in, how could they tell in retrospect what issues had been addressed?
2020-04-28T16:51:53  <Bosmon> Does this method depend that github be available for all time, and that we no longer expect to be able to reconstruct our activities just from git commit messages?
2020-04-28T16:54:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's an example of a larger squash from the wecount site https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/commit/66849530ff955d4a5b13872a1fc3d5c8c3f0536d
2020-04-28T16:55:40  <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks, that's helpful
2020-04-28T16:56:39  <colinclark> that squash is still full of information, Justin_o
2020-04-28T16:57:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's an example of the blame from the README https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blame/dev/README.md
2020-04-28T16:57:11  <colinclark> i’ve never understood the desire to squash commits, especially at our scale, but at least it’s still informative

2020-04-28T16:59:50  <Justin_o> colinclark: i think there are pros and cons, so it's not necessarily the way that every project/repo should work. One thing, and this can be a pro or con, is that it does force you to have smaller PRs. That is, you'd want to avoid doing lots of different work in a single PR.
2020-04-28T17:00:26  <colinclark> right
2020-04-28T17:00:37  <Bosmon> Like the way I have been doing for the last 3 years : P
2020-04-28T17:01:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, so we probably wouldn't do this for infusion.
2020-04-28T17:01:39  <Justin_o> and I think there is a need in infusion, at least with the current big PR to have an umbrella of changes
2020-04-28T17:02:55  <Bosmon> Justin_o - could this have used the docs: prefix rather than fix? : https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus/pull/5/files
2020-04-28T17:05:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. that's interesting.. I guess so. I was viewing it as a bug with the way the License was specified, as opposed to documenting what the License is.
2020-04-28T17:06:57  <Justin_o> I'm still learning the conventional commits spec, it seems like mostly it's pretty flexible to use how you like. however, there is implied meaning to others for things like fix and feat, and the prefix can also be used for auto generating change logs and identifying when what the next version number should be (i.e. patch, minor, major) based on the changes.
2020-04-28T17:11:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also you raise a good point about my monolithic PR https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus/pull/8 I've converted it to a draft PR for now, that way it's communicated that it isn't ready to go in.
