2019-04-27T00:29:53  <sgithens> Bosmon, I've ran in to the issue where I can't inject them because they probably don't exist at the time it's queued up or something, I'm still a bit foggy as to how the entire test harness is spun up.   For example here, the argument `c` which was injected comes in as undefined, but if I look it up in the method itself while it's running, it finds it ok.

2019-04-27T00:31:58  <sgithens> it was interesting to sift through the test config setup in the debugger repl, and see how all the server items are structured in the tree
