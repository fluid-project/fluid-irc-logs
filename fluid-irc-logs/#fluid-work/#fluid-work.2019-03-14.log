2019-03-14T18:57:15  <sgithens> cindyli: Do you think we should have an early morning meeting next week to go over these NOVA data model improvments you're working on? Bosmon the-t-in-rtf
2019-03-14T18:58:43  <sgithens> gmoss: Actually, it's maybe not super related to the talk yesterday, but I was wondering, if you're deaf and go to a loud rave or something like that... should you still wear earplugs?  Does loud music potentially effect/damage other ear functions like maintaining balance and stuff?
2019-03-14T18:59:32  <cindyli> sgithens: sounds a good idea to me.
2019-03-14T18:59:49  <sgithens> cindyli: Cool, maybe our tuesday morning time?
2019-03-14T19:00:27  <cindyli> fine with me, sgithens.
2019-03-14T19:03:19  <michelled> gmoss, cindyli, simonjb: I'll be another 10 minutes for so
2019-03-14T19:03:30  <simonjb> michelled: np
2019-03-14T19:04:43  <cindyli> ok
2019-03-14T19:05:48  <gmoss> sgithens: that's a very interesting question. I'm also interested in the answer!
2019-03-14T19:06:16  <gmoss> michelled: no worries :) I need to set Vidyo up on this loaner machine I'm using currently
2019-03-14T19:08:21  <jhernandez> sgithens: gmoss don't have much idea, but I assume that it might depend on the kind of deafness ?
2019-03-14T19:10:20  <jhernandez> Bosmon: cindyli stegru FYI, haven't had the time to test all the login stuff together :(
2019-03-14T19:11:32  <jhernandez> I can only say that cindyli's side is ok since I can login with a user that doesn't exist and that the key/prefsSafe pair is being created in the db
2019-03-14T19:11:46  <jhernandez> (which I assume is "fine")
2019-03-14T19:12:28  <gmoss> jhernandez sgithens: I don't know enough about various mechanisms of deafness in general so I can't really say, but I think this would be a concern that applies to many people whether they're hard of hearing or otherwise.
2019-03-14T19:12:41  <jhernandez> if no other "rush" installer is needed for tomorrow, I might have time to completely test the entire login solution
2019-03-14T19:15:35  <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez
2019-03-14T19:22:08  <michelled> gmoss, simonjb, cindyli: I'm ready now - sorry about that - I'm going to see if the collab room is available

2019-03-14T19:37:09  <bryan_> sgithens: I just asked my friend who is deaf and he said rock concert probably not but, directing traffic at an airport definitely because the pain receptors still work. Also if the deafness is neurological (like his) you want to keep the eardrums in good shape in case there is a neurological fix down the road.
2019-03-14T19:40:37  <sgithens> bryan_: Awesome, thanks!
