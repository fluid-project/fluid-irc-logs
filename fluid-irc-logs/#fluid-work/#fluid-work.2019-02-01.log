2019-02-01T12:55:56  <javjarfer[m]> Hi Bosmon ! Sorry for the delay, I was outside today. I have left a comment of GPII-3644, hope it's everything that is needed

2019-02-01T13:30:16  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m] - when you say "both branches" do you mean that one of them is the GPII-3644 branch for universal?
2019-02-01T13:30:27  <Bosmon> If so I guess that pull needs to be regenerated
2019-02-01T13:59:25  <javjarfer[m]> @Bosmon yes, I meant that, but CI have just passed against the that updated branch of universal, if you like I can resubmit the pull
2019-02-01T13:59:59  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - sure, it would be just to check that the internal CI for the universal branch still passes
2019-02-01T14:02:48  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon, great I will resubmit it (It may be in a couple of hours, just so you can know about timing)

2019-02-01T16:57:14  <cindyli> Bosmon, javjarfer[m], jhernandez, it seems there are 2 ways to define "update" array in a solution registry:
2019-02-01T16:57:33  <cindyli> 1. "update": ["settings.configure"]
2019-02-01T16:57:38  <cindyli> such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4460-L4464
2019-02-01T16:57:48  <cindyli> 2. "update": ["configure"]
2019-02-01T16:58:04  <cindyli> such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6963-L6966
2019-02-01T16:58:17  <cindyli> are they both valid?
2019-02-01T17:00:31  <cindyli> I'm working on removing elements from this array if the corresponding settingsHandler has empty settings payload. i guess i should support both formats until the onboarding team reaches a consensus.
2019-02-01T17:01:21  <jhernandez> cindyli: yes, and I "think" that both are "valid"

2019-02-01T17:02:24  <jhernandez> but yeah, looks that we have to come to a consensus that is valid without double quotes :)
2019-02-01T17:05:49  <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhernandez

2019-02-01T21:02:21  <Bosmon> cindyli, jhernandez - sorry to miss the question earlier
2019-02-01T21:02:34  <Bosmon> I don't actually think we should continue with both ways of expressing the same thing
2019-02-01T21:03:18  <Bosmon> Is there any other kind of "container" that could take the place of "settings" before the period?
2019-02-01T21:05:24  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m] - I found that the state of your universal GPII-3644 branch is actually identical with master

2019-02-01T21:10:50  <cindyli> Bosmon: why do we need another kind of "container" to replace "settings". can we sync up through all these "update", "restore", "config" arrays by either adding or removing "settings." prefix

2019-02-01T21:28:19  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, this is my question
2019-02-01T21:28:37  <Bosmon> I'm just asking what else this prefix could be - if the answer is nothing, then we don't need it : P
2019-02-01T21:31:27  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - interestingly enough, my pull gives just the same error in CI that it does locally - https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/243
2019-02-01T21:31:42  <cindyli> i see. "settings." is the only one I've seen so far. but jhernandez certainly knows better
