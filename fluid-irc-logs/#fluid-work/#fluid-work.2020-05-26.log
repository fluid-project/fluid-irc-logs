2020-05-26T12:22:39  <Sachinn10101998> I've migrated it as a node package.

2020-05-26T17:45:47  <sachin10101998> Justin_o could you explain more by what you meant by adding prepare script for front end dependencies?
2020-05-26T17:46:25  <sachin10101998> I have addressed all other review comments apart from that one.
2020-05-26T17:48:16  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: if you look at https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts
2020-05-26T17:48:32  <Justin_o> it describes the scripts block for a package.json file
2020-05-26T17:48:52  <Justin_o> some scripts have special meanings, and prepare is one of those. Notice that it runs before publish and on local npm install.
2020-05-26T17:49:31  <sachin10101998> mm hmm
2020-05-26T17:50:05  <sachin10101998> but are there anhy such front end dependencies which need to be installed before npm install?
2020-05-26T17:51:19  <Justin_o> so you can add `prepare: grunt installFrontEnd`
2020-05-26T17:51:57  <sachin10101998> for copying the files from infusion?
2020-05-26T17:52:11  <Justin_o> yes, make sure you have all the dependencies in the right place
2020-05-26T17:52:17  <sachin10101998> got it
2020-05-26T17:52:59  <sachin10101998> also infusion-custom.js file does not have a default newline at end which is reported in lint script
2020-05-26T17:53:38  <sachin10101998> I have excluded testing of infusion-all.js file but should a new line be added to it by default?
2020-05-26T17:58:45  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I think linting shouldn't apply to any minified or otherwise bundled code, i.e. anything in Infusion's `dist` directory
2020-05-26T17:58:57  <gmoss> *anything in or from Infusion's `dist` directory
2020-05-26T17:59:03  <sachin10101998> It's not in the dist directory
2020-05-26T17:59:14  <sachin10101998> it's in src/lib/infusion/infusion-all.js
2020-05-26T18:01:06  <gmoss> sachin10101998: right, but at some point it's copied into there from dist, maybe not by you :) the main point is that since it's "external" code you're using but not developing, I think it's safe not to lint in within the context of the Fluid Project site work
2020-05-26T18:01:34  <gmoss> (others may disagree :))
2020-05-26T18:01:37  <sachin10101998> yeah. I have excluded it from source files to be linted
2020-05-26T18:03:28  <gmoss> great!
2020-05-26T18:04:25  <gmoss> (btw, I agree that it should have the newline, but it's a moot point)
2020-05-26T18:05:15  <sachin10101998> hmm no newline can be troubling at times
2020-05-26T18:05:56  <gmoss> sachin10101998: perhaps it's worth filing an issue on the Infusion repo to point that out, since it's likely a symptom of the build process in that codebase
2020-05-26T18:06:20  <sachin10101998> Alright, will do.
2020-05-26T18:08:18  <Justin_o> gmoss, sachin10101998: I agree that 3rd party lib files should not be linted. Also not sure if the infusion-all should have a newline at the end. but curious to know your thoughts. In the future we may just ship the. minified file and the source map, but not sure yet.

2020-05-26T18:27:52  <sgithens> intense
2020-05-26T18:28:13  <philip__> So I'm working on a little tool that connects to google spreadsheets and lets you visualize them and set up persistent data relationships
2020-05-26T18:29:20  <philip__> So far it's been slow going getting comfortable with the Infusion technology stack, though `:-D
2020-05-26T18:31:59  <sgithens> that's pretty cool
2020-05-26T18:32:26  <sgithens> love to try it out when it's ready for a try out
2020-05-26T18:35:03  <philip__> Sure thing. Any reason why you're thinking about nexus stuff?
2020-05-26T18:39:09  <gmoss> philip__: tangential to your comments about the SensorTag, and I've mentioned it before when we chatted about SensorTag pre-lockdown: would you be interested in getting your hands on the PSLab dev board? (https://pslab.io/) Mine is just taking up space in my desk drawer, fully sealed and unopened. If so, just let me know! I could deliver it to you outside of work hours, gives me an excuse to take the bike out :)

2020-05-26T20:32:23  <sachin10101998> All the blog posts are present in the news folder anyway then why have a separate folder for blogs
2020-05-26T20:33:30  <sachin10101998> not all blog posts are present in the news *
2020-05-26T20:33:43  <sachin10101998> but the website shows only links to news archive
2020-05-26T20:36:54  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'm not really sure, jhung would probably know best, but he doesn't appear to be online right now
2020-05-26T20:37:29  <sachin10101998> I'll be creating md files for both and keep everything as it is right now. We can delete it later if it's not required.
2020-05-26T20:37:45  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: sounds good
2020-05-26T20:45:32  <gmoss> sachin10101998: nice catch! I agree with your current approach, we can decide later on what to do with the blog content. Someone made the decision not to show this content, it would be good to find out why
2020-05-26T20:45:32  <gmoss> Fwiw, I don't see any way to access the blog content through the site as it is currently. There does seem to be a fair amount of blog content that isn't in the news folder, though, in fact there's almost no duplication from what I can see
2020-05-26T20:45:32  <gmoss> From a standpoint of history preservation, it would be nice to hold onto this stuff, but if we don't intend for it to be visible within the site as it's presented to users, then it may not make sense to keep it in the repo. Whatever content is there will persist in old commits, if we decide to delete it

2020-05-26T20:48:45  <sachin10101998> The site would look similar to what it is now.

2020-05-26T20:53:17  <sachin10101998> We can decide upon the date

2020-05-26T21:03:46  <gmoss> sachin10101998: yeah I was hoping we would discuss the CMS a little last week. let me think about what forum we should use for any further discussion on that choice... sending an email to the fluid-work mailing list would be a good starting point to collect feedback on experience with various headless CMS's, what their accessibility is like, etc. I know we're using Netlify CMS and headless WordPress for current sites
2020-05-26T21:03:46  <gmoss> Whatever CMS we choose should be as accessible as possible (WCAG compliance at any level would be great), and you could look into how customizable the output of them is from the author's point of view. I.e. the more use of semantic markup and the less obfuscated the resulting markup is, the better.
2020-05-26T21:07:12  <gmoss> *i realize I'm confusing myself. the CMS wouldn't be outputting the markup
2020-05-26T21:07:22  <gmoss> anyway, the accessibility concerns still hold :)

2020-05-26T21:39:53  <gmoss> sachin10101998: ah yes, that one :)
2020-05-26T21:40:04  <gmoss> I wonder if and how anyone's answer may have changed
2020-05-26T21:40:32  <sachin10101998> But then everyone settled with Wordpress I believe.
2020-05-26T21:40:45  <sachin10101998> and Netlify cms was projected in bad light somehow
2020-05-26T21:40:59  <sachin10101998> I haven't worked a lot with cms before so Id have to research again a bit.
2020-05-26T21:41:37  <sachin10101998> I looked into the basics of it while preparing the proposal, but if everyone else in the community prefers wordpress over netlify cms , maybe we should reopen the discussion and see if something comes up
2020-05-26T21:42:18  <gmoss> sachin10101998: indeed, that's what we went with, though we also weren't planning on using an SSG for that work. I think Netlify CMS was seen as a little troublesome to use, so we shied away from it for that particular site.
2020-05-26T21:42:36  <sachin10101998> Hmm.
2020-05-26T21:42:48  <sachin10101998> How do we go ahead with this, then?
2020-05-26T21:42:54  <gmoss> I think it's worth revisiting the question with the FLOE and Fluid Project sites in mind. It would also be good to refer to last year's discussion
2020-05-26T21:43:12  <gmoss> as a community, we've got a little more experience with these CMS's now than we did then
2020-05-26T21:43:28  <gmoss> and other options may be available now that weren't considered previously

2020-05-26T21:47:29  <gmoss> sachin10101998: in the email thread you found, we were planning work for the IDRC site and a redesign of the Inclusive Learning Design Handbook
2020-05-26T21:47:54  <gmoss> the IDRC site has since launched, and ILDH has been put on hold for the time being

2020-05-26T21:50:11  <sachin10101998> ildh one?
2020-05-26T21:50:29  <sachin10101998> so no code was written?
2020-05-26T21:51:09  <gmoss> sachin10101998: no new code was written last year. the old repo is here, it runs on DocPad: https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning
2020-05-26T21:51:51  <sachin10101998> alright. the idrc site uses 11ty+netlify-cms, right?
2020-05-26T21:52:03  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I believe so! greatislander can confirm
2020-05-26T21:52:11  <greatislander> yep
2020-05-26T21:52:56  <greatislander> there's another option i'd like to explore for Git-backed CMSes which is https://forestry.io but I haven't had the opportunity yet
2020-05-26T21:54:59  <gmoss> greatislander: cool! I got a kick out of this quote: "Your editing team won’t even realize they’re writing Markdown and committing to your repo." as if it's some dastardly deception :P
2020-05-26T21:55:08  <greatislander> hahahaha
2020-05-26T21:55:17  <sachin10101998> lol
2020-05-26T21:56:14  <sachin10101998> I did touch upon a very basic difference between forestry netlify cms and netlify but there's not much in the proposal.
2020-05-26T22:03:17  <colinclark> I think it’s also quite reasonable to ask if we need a CMS at all for these sites :)
2020-05-26T22:03:46  <sachin10101998> Depends on how frequently e have to update the news section
2020-05-26T22:04:29  <colinclark> Well, I think more importantly, the question is who has to update the news section
2020-05-26T22:05:03  <sachin10101998> Not non developers probably.
2020-05-26T22:08:48  <gmoss> sachin10101998: it's likely that someone who isn't primarily a developer, or a developer at all, will be making content changes to both of these sites. Given what colinclark said during our discussion last week about doing what we can to make this easier for those who aren't programmers, whatever we can do to that end will be good
2020-05-26T22:10:58  <colinclark> i think you may be over editorializing my comments, gmoss
2020-05-26T22:11:10  <colinclark> Obviously easy for non-programmers is amazing
2020-05-26T22:11:24  <colinclark> but I was getting at something a bit deeper than the CMS
2020-05-26T22:12:17  <colinclark> Forestry does look quite interesting, though
2020-05-26T22:12:46  <colinclark> especially if they have open source plans
2020-05-26T22:13:05  <colinclark> it’s just so hard to read what the exit plans are for a lot of these startups
2020-05-26T22:13:09  <sachin10101998> I guess not.
2020-05-26T22:13:12  <colinclark> Netlify in pafrticular worries me
2020-05-26T22:13:18  <colinclark> particular
2020-05-26T22:13:32  <sachin10101998> Netlify itself is a commercial service but netlify-cms would remain open source for sure
2020-05-26T22:13:46  <colinclark> Right
2020-05-26T22:14:02  <colinclark> but a huge amount of the value of Netlify’s service is their seamlessness
2020-05-26T22:14:11  <colinclark> I mean, for the eco-op site, it was just so easy
2020-05-26T22:14:25  <colinclark> but when IBM buys them, for example, what then?
2020-05-26T22:14:34  <colinclark> (who knows if they will)
2020-05-26T22:14:50  <colinclark> but it can be difficult in this climate for startups to know who’s going to be around in a decade
2020-05-26T22:14:55  <colinclark> these sites are nearly that old :)
2020-05-26T22:15:18  <colinclark> And yet there are a very different set of costs to hosting, say, a headless CMS

2020-05-26T22:20:05  <sachin10101998> I am still not sure of what you might be suggesting colinclark
2020-05-26T22:20:41  <sachin10101998> Are you saying that we do away with cms stuff or we go with an option that would remain FOSS for sure in foreseeable future
2020-05-26T22:21:02  <colinclark> Well, I was just thinking aloud, sachin10101998
2020-05-26T22:21:09  <sachin10101998> haha
2020-05-26T22:21:16  <colinclark> One totally reasonable option might be to have no CMS at all
2020-05-26T22:22:00  <colinclark> if there is a relatively easy process for adding new items to the website by writing some markdown and committing it to a Git repo, that’s a good start for these sites
2020-05-26T22:22:26  <colinclark> I think it would be quite nice to have a good CMS backend at least for editing news stories and the like, especially on the FLOE website
2020-05-26T22:23:03  <colinclark> my feeling there is that we may want to spend some time finding a CMS that will be something we can potentially host ourselves, but which represents a lower cost of maintenance than WordPress
2020-05-26T22:23:31  <colinclark> this is an issue I’ve talked with gtirloni about in the past, but there are a lot of moving pieces
2020-05-26T22:23:34  <colinclark> and a lot of things to be done first
2020-05-26T22:24:10  <colinclark> So I think the biggest part of the job is to have a set of goals…
2020-05-26T22:24:13  <colinclark> short term, medium term, long term
2020-05-26T22:24:54  <colinclark> Short term, perhaps we’re not so worried about a CMS, and more focussed on making sure the basic experience of editing and maintaining the site using just markdown and Git is good
2020-05-26T22:25:25  <colinclark> medium term, we might choose to bootstrap site editing and hosting using something like Netlify, since it’s so good and we do have an open source account for it
2020-05-26T22:26:04  <colinclark> The long term vision, which should be thought through with gtirloni and greatislander, would involve an open source CMS that is viable for us to use and self-host at scale
2020-05-26T22:26:32  <colinclark> when I say “at scale,” I mean something in particular, which was part of what I was getting at in my email and comments at the meeting we had
2020-05-26T22:27:15  <colinclark> meaning, if we can find technologies that work really nicely for these sites, but that we can also easily automate and build some infrastructure around so that it will be much easier for the next developer who comes along and wants to build a new site
2020-05-26T22:27:59  <colinclark> I think having a general way of approaching these problems is helpful…
2020-05-26T22:28:31  <colinclark> in general, where there’s a very strong, open, affordable, highly usable hosted service that we think has a sustainable model, we should use it
2020-05-26T22:28:41  <colinclark> there aren’t many tools like that out there, sadly
2020-05-26T22:28:47  <colinclark> Github is the best example I can think of :)
2020-05-26T22:29:06  <colinclark> What’s great about Github is that it’s foundation is Git—something that’s very very portable and open
2020-05-26T22:29:31  <colinclark> so worst case, let’s say Github is gone on turns “evil” (they probably won’t)
2020-05-26T22:29:55  <colinclark> at least you know that a huge part of the value of your project is portable—a git repository can be hosted in many different ways
2020-05-26T22:30:02  <colinclark> Secondly, it’s a very sustainable business
2020-05-26T22:30:23  <colinclark> Now that they’ve been bought by Microsoft, I think they’re very stable
2020-05-26T22:30:31  <colinclark> they’re not likely to disappear in the next decade
2020-05-26T22:30:52  <colinclark> theyr’e not likely to suddenly have to switch to a more extractive business model that non-profits and open source communities like us can’t handle
2020-05-26T22:31:02  <colinclark> or to start mining and extracting data in creepy ways
2020-05-26T22:31:22  <colinclark> So for those rare situation, commercial hosted solutions are perfect for us
2020-05-26T22:31:33  <colinclark> In other cases, we  might take some risks
2020-05-26T22:32:08  <colinclark> we don’t know the future of Netlify, but we know what the offer is extremely useable and we’re still loosely integrated so that if we had to migrate, it might hurt but it wouldn’t be impossible
2020-05-26T22:32:16  <colinclark> Small, light, self hosted technologies are also ideal
2020-05-26T22:32:34  <colinclark> As a little community, and very much grant funded, we can’t afford to host everything
2020-05-26T22:32:54  <colinclark> but we do have the capacity to build around some great open technologies, and share them across projects and with like-minded communitties
2020-05-26T22:32:58  <colinclark> communities
2020-05-26T22:33:04  <colinclark> this macbook keyboard is terrible to type on :)
2020-05-26T22:33:20  <colinclark> anyway, that’s my thinking about how to think about technologies decisions from that perspective
2020-05-26T22:33:47  <colinclark> sometime we can maybe talk more about what I was getting at in our Zoom meeting
2020-05-26T22:34:00  <colinclark> which was, as gmoss said, aboout making things easier for non-programmers
2020-05-26T22:34:40  <colinclark> but it wasn’t just about “easy to use"
2020-05-26T22:34:44  <colinclark> but rather “power to create”
2020-05-26T22:35:03  <colinclark> anyway, that’s for our next episode, sachin10101998 :) :)
2020-05-26T22:38:03  <gmoss> colinclark: I oversimplified, for sure :) as I recall you were also advocating for the ability for non-programmers to be able to make design changes to a site as well, and what has led to the philosophical underpinnings of Infusion. It's fascinating stuff, to me, and I think I'll give it a bit more time to digest. I appreciate your outline, just now!
2020-05-26T22:38:39  <colinclark> no problem
2020-05-26T22:39:50  <colinclark> sorry, i didn’t mean to suggest you oversimplified
2020-05-26T22:40:01  <colinclark> both issues matter
2020-05-26T22:40:36  <sachin10101998> that's lot of insight tbh.
2020-05-26T22:40:47  <colinclark> lol
2020-05-26T22:41:04  <colinclark> it’s a lot of something, sachin10101998 ;)
2020-05-26T22:41:16  <sachin10101998> It's still helpful though
2020-05-26T22:43:43  <sachin10101998> Presently, after the migration, we'd have md template which can be edited locally and on Github website too and it would itself be added to the news list and stuff. the way I implemented it also has options for scheduling posts for future and preparing drafts. So the short term goal of being able to edit blogs using md and git has pretty much been achieved.
2020-05-26T22:45:40  <sachin10101998> Comparing the mid term and long term goals, I'd always suggest against the use of any commercial third party service for both FLOE and Fluid projects. Open source projects should be self sustainable to the maximum capacity. Talking of medium term goals , we can play around with github api.
2020-05-26T22:47:43  <sachin10101998> in case we don't specifically want to go ahead with cms. We can create short forms where things like title data and date can be provided by us. And using auth tokens we can post that to our git repo using a service.
2020-05-26T22:48:35  <sachin10101998> One such example of a service is staticman which takes data through forms(comments generally) and then posts it to github repo at appropriate places .
2020-05-26T22:49:30  <sachin10101998> We can host our own such instances. The benefit with using them is that instead of charging us for the total time that the sevice stays online (on Heroku) , they charge for the number of hits.
2020-05-26T22:50:12  <sachin10101998> The limit for the same is around 500 comments per month I guess.
2020-05-26T22:50:37  <sachin10101998> comments = hits to the service
2020-05-26T22:51:23  <sachin10101998> So in case we don't have more than 500 posts to make per month, that could help us.
2020-05-26T22:51:33  <colinclark> that’s very interesting, sachin10101998
2020-05-26T22:52:48  <sachin10101998> https://staticmanlove.herokuapp.com/ I hosted this service last year
2020-05-26T22:52:51  <gmoss> sachin10101998: very cool! I'll take a look at Staticman tomorrow and weigh in then. So far, I like that it's FOSS
2020-05-26T22:53:20  <sachin10101998> take at look at this. the service is still up even after an year.
2020-05-26T22:53:53  <sachin10101998> Reason being 500 hits were not made to the service and I didn't have to pay a penny either
2020-05-26T22:54:00  <sachin10101998> sure gmoss
2020-05-26T22:57:11  <sachin10101998> There's another benefit of using service similar to this. we can tweak this bot to send a PR to the required repo and this we can monitor who posts using the form we create. ( We can always keep the link private though) Still in case we need, we can either turn the moderation on (PR would be created) or turn it off ( stuff would be directly committed to the repo.
