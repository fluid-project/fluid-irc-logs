2019-12-12T14:49:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so I'm running into a situation with minimalEditor prefs framework example.
2019-12-12T14:50:28  <Justin_o> In my FLUID-6420 branch, which is now based off your FLUID-6148 work. I've updated it to use the changes from FLUID-6420 but the prefs editor is not appearing. Doing some digging it seems that the "onCreatePrefsEditorReady" event isn't firing. This event is needed to trigger the creation of the prefsEditor sub component.
2019-12-12T14:50:51  <Justin_o> onCreatePrefsEditorReady is a composite event made up of onPrefsEditorTemplatesLoaded and onPrefsEditorMessagesLoaded
2019-12-12T14:51:32  <Justin_o> so the interesting thing with this demo is that it doesn't make use of any message bundles and just relies on the text built into the templates
2019-12-12T14:51:51  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, so I guess there may be an issue that the event does not fire if there are no resources to be loaded?
2019-12-12T14:51:58  <Bosmon> I guess this is a bug which needs fixing
2019-12-12T14:52:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, I believe that's the case, but I'm not sure why this example is working in master. https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/minimalEditor/
2019-12-12T14:52:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - there have been so many changes in the implementation, this could easily have fallen through the cracks
2019-12-12T14:52:52  <Bosmon> If you check in what you've got I'll look it over and derive a test case and fix from it
2019-12-12T14:53:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2019-12-12T14:53:20  <Justin_o> I'll push up shortly.. all the other demos, examples, and manual tests should be working
2019-12-12T14:54:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well that's great, it looks like we are extremely close
2019-12-12T14:54:40  <Bosmon> Also it sounds like gmoss has also resolved the majority of the SJRK issues
2019-12-12T14:55:14  <Bosmon> That just leaves the GPII as a holdout, cindyli1 has issued a good fix for the frontline options modification in the FlowManager but I will now need to go back and retest to find what the next problem is
2019-12-12T14:56:03  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2019-12-12T14:56:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, hopefully we've eradicated all or at least most of the issues holding FLUID-6148 up.
2019-12-12T14:56:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also gmoss and I were pairing the other night and while he was able to get the localization mostly working, there were a lot of things that could be improved throughout the prefs framework.
2019-12-12T14:57:44  <Justin_o> I wonder if we can devise a generalized approach, pre-renderer 2.0, of having components respond to localization changes

2019-12-12T15:02:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, it's all pushed up to my FLUID-6420 branch
2019-12-12T15:02:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers, I'll take a look shortly
2019-12-12T15:03:08  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the new approach to localisation is simply to issue a model update to model.resourceLoader.locale
2019-12-12T15:04:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sadly not all of our components have message loaders  of their own and rely on values passed along.. But also they need to be able to re-render their UI
2019-12-12T15:04:40  <Justin_o> which for things that aren't renderer components, may all be done in different ways :(

2019-12-12T15:06:16  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess they are not "passed along" in models then?
2019-12-12T15:06:31  <Bosmon> There's a stopgap approach I've rewritten in my FLUID-6148 branch of the gpii-app that looks like this: https://github.com/amb26/gpii-app/blob/FLUID-6148/src/shared/messageBundles.js#L229
2019-12-12T15:06:51  <Bosmon> A component that wants to opt into dynamically relocalised messages can inherit from this grade
2019-12-12T15:07:18  <Bosmon> Although there are some special pieces of the setup here, in that the HA team have adopted a bundle naming scheme where the first part of a bundle key is a grade name
2019-12-12T15:07:25  <Bosmon> Which helps the messages get routed to where they need to go
2019-12-12T15:11:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, I'll take a look at it
2019-12-12T15:12:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it's likely not usable directly but it might be helpful for inspiration
2019-12-12T15:12:35  <Bosmon> I guess we should take an inventory of all the different approaches we can find to receiving messages in the prefs framework
2019-12-12T15:12:43  <Bosmon> What components do we have that are not renderer components?
2019-12-12T15:13:46  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@c-73-107-162-68.hsd1.fl.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: colinclark)
2019-12-12T15:14:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: in the prefs framework there are at least a few cases, 1) where the message loader at the top level fetches all of the messages and passes them down. These are then handled by the message resolvers in the panels. 2) the sliding panel makes uses of one of these prefetched values, but is not itself a renderer component and just passes the value along 3) enactors haven't been able to benefit from the
2019-12-12T15:14:09  <Justin_o> prefetching of the message loader. The ToC enactor now has it's own message loader and passes off the relevant strings into the strings block of the component.
2019-12-12T15:14:38  <Justin_o> amazingly I was writing up the answer to your question as you were asking it :)
2019-12-12T15:15:28  <Justin_o> I imagine TTS is in a similar situation as ToC, but I don't think we've actually tried to localize it

2019-12-12T15:15:55  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's really great, thanks
2019-12-12T15:15:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-12-12T15:16:07  <Bosmon> I guess it's worth just switching everything over to being a ResourceLoader
2019-12-12T15:16:34  <Bosmon> Although we should check what is behind gmoss' performance issues
2019-12-12T15:16:36  <Justin_o> when you say switching everything over to being a ResourceLoader, what does that mean exactly?
2019-12-12T15:16:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, good point about the performance
2019-12-12T15:16:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean, inheriting all these components from fluid.resourceLoader : P
2019-12-12T15:17:07  <Bosmon> And then they can just load their own stuff however, and be localised in the standard way
2019-12-12T15:17:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so they'd have grades of [fluid.rendererComponent, fluid.resourceLoader]?
2019-12-12T15:17:34  <Bosmon> Re. performance - I know that the model system will copy the message bundles a couple of times per update
2019-12-12T15:17:41  <Bosmon> But hopefully this won't be the show-stopper it was in 2009
2019-12-12T15:17:50  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that will be the standard approach going forward, yes
2019-12-12T15:18:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess for the other components it would be [fluid.resourceLoader, fluid.viewComponent]
2019-12-12T15:19:11  <Justin_o> will being resoureLoader have any affect on the strings block?
2019-12-12T15:20:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well we will have to abandon strings blocks I think, they're a nice idea
2019-12-12T15:20:28  <Bosmon> Although I guess leapfrogging to a "hyper-modern" renderer we would be able to retain them with the approach of destroying the component and recreating it
2019-12-12T15:20:48  <Bosmon> But I can't see how, in the short term, we can localise a component which sources stuff from its "strings" block
2019-12-12T15:23:18  <Justin_o> okay
2019-12-12T15:23:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks,
2019-12-12T15:23:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: where do you think this all falls in the priority of things for UIO and UIO+?
2019-12-12T15:23:41  <Bosmon> It's a bit annoying how solutions to this problem are emerging on two fronts at once, that is, i) the "Queen of Sheba" model where any static adaptation can happen through destroying and recreating the tree, ii) the "immutable application" model that will stop model material from being endlessly copies
2019-12-12T15:24:02  <Bosmon> But in terms of the impact of repeated changes on the codebase, it seems that planning for option ii) is more promising
2019-12-12T15:24:32  <Bosmon> In that anything that *can* be adapted in the model probably should be, since it will always be more inefficient and possibly less accessible to be constantly destroying and recreating stuff
2019-12-12T15:24:51  <Bosmon> So I suggest our best route is to modelise everything and to see what we can do in the short term to minimise the performance impact
2019-12-12T15:25:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2019-12-12T15:25:12  <Bosmon> endlessly copies - > endlessly copied
2019-12-12T15:25:19  <Justin_o> seams reasonable.
2019-12-12T15:25:36  <Bosmon> Rewriting the model system should have zero effect on implementation code that is already well-behaved and modifies the model only through the ChangeApplier
2019-12-12T15:25:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so anything that might be modified is a model value, and anything static is an option
2019-12-12T15:25:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well that was always the idiom : P
2019-12-12T15:26:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: are we going to drop support for members?
2019-12-12T15:26:07  <Bosmon> Although we have to note, as a fundamental philosophical point, it forces a bit of a puzzling design on the user
2019-12-12T15:26:19  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, we can't drop support for them since the user will always need an "escape hatch" of some kind
2019-12-12T15:26:33  <Bosmon> We can't let the framework completely paint them into a corner as regards mutability
2019-12-12T15:26:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that's nice of us :)
2019-12-12T15:27:00  <Bosmon> But they will become more and more of a sore thumb in a design as the framework starts to have better answers to standard design questions
2019-12-12T15:27:47  <Bosmon> At some point, once we have properly immutable models to go with our now immutable options, and a robust "Queen of Sheba" system, we finally start to think about closing up the design gap between model material and ordinary options, but that's a pretty profound issue that is many years away
2019-12-12T15:27:53  <Bosmon> But I think we can't avoid it, in the very long term
2019-12-12T15:28:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: at least we're progressing towards
2019-12-12T15:28:38  <Justin_o> it
2019-12-12T15:28:52  <Bosmon> I notice though that a somewhat similar design gap remains in React between the things they call "props" and the things they call "state"
2019-12-12T15:29:18  <Bosmon> So it may not be absolutely necessary to do something about it, who knows... I'm still not really sure what it would look like

2019-12-12T15:29:44  <Bosmon> I just worry about the design "viscosity" of forcing the user to commit at a very early stage to a decision about stuff which they expect to be mutable and stuff which they expect to be immutable

2019-12-12T15:31:19  <Bosmon> Our notion of "model" was directly transferred from MVC which was certainly all about enforcing a very clear design separation of this kind
