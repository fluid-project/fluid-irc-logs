2018-10-25T08:38:38  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez (or anyone), is there a dev release of universal that uses the new package name?
2018-10-25T08:39:06  <the-t-in-rtf> or is that only for the npm package name?
2018-10-25T08:39:06  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: which new package name?
2018-10-25T08:39:11  <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-universal

2018-10-25T08:41:03  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: right, it's the npm package name
2018-10-25T08:41:26  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will keep using universal for other stuff, but that's a bit confusing.
2018-10-25T08:41:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we should be used to it with fluid = require("infusion") and all

2018-10-25T08:45:14  <jhernandez> s/it/in
2018-10-25T08:45:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I realise that now.  I was just having to update a package.json in an older repo to use gpii-universal and just assumed it was across the board from a particular version
2018-10-25T08:46:15  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. that the name change was not just in the npm package name.
2018-10-25T08:46:31  <the-t-in-rtf> what do you have to do to publish it with a name other than the name in the package.json?
2018-10-25T08:46:48  <the-t-in-rtf> are there extra args that you have to use for fluid-publish, or do you do it manually or something?
2018-10-25T08:47:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess you must be using fluid-publish from the dev releases.

2018-10-25T13:42:10  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: sorry the-t-in-rtf, I had to leave for paperwork and I'm just reading this
2018-10-25T13:42:53  <jhernandez> no extra magic, look at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L2
2018-10-25T13:43:25  <jhernandez> so I just run fluid-publish, that's all
2018-10-25T13:44:26  <jhernandez> the repo is called universal but the package is called gpii-universal
2018-10-25T13:45:51  <jhernandez> and by having fluid=require("gpii-universal") is enough

2018-10-25T14:17:56  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, my point is that fluid.require("%universal") is still a thing.
2018-10-25T14:18:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I use that and fluid.module.resolvePath a lot to pick up sub-modules, test fixtures, etc
2018-10-25T14:19:09  <the-t-in-rtf> if the idea is that everything but the repo should be gpii-universal, then index.js also needs to be updated.
2018-10-25T14:19:51  <the-t-in-rtf> there's no reason we couldn't register it as both as a transitional approach

2018-10-25T15:21:17  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do we have a method or is there a recommended approach for injecting scripts and waiting for them to load before trying to execute its code
2018-10-25T15:21:41  <Bosmon> Justin_o - there's the approaches we used in Fluid Engage in 2008 :)
2018-10-25T15:21:53  <Justin_o> i'm currently trying to inject the script tag and use jQuery's .on("load", func) to resolve a promise, but the event doesn't seem to be firing

2018-10-25T15:25:19  <Bosmon> Justin_o - perhaps you have done the registration in the wrong order
2018-10-25T15:25:29  <Bosmon> Have you tried experimenting with a raw "onload" attribute?
2018-10-25T15:25:52  <Justin_o> this is my latest attempt
2018-10-25T15:26:02  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CryfEmSQ/
2018-10-25T15:26:12  <Justin_o> i haven't tried the raw "unload" attribute
2018-10-25T15:27:44  <Justin_o> with the above snippet the tag is injected and the src file does show up. If i resolve outside of the load event i can access the code
2018-10-25T15:49:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - don't see any reason why that shouldn't work
2018-10-25T15:54:48  <Bosmon> Just for anyone who this might be relevant to, I'm getting very slow downloads from idrc.cachefly.net
2018-10-25T15:55:16  <Bosmon> Less than 1MB/sec which is less than 10% of what I might expect
2018-10-25T15:55:56  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. i thought it looked okay.. thanks for verifying
