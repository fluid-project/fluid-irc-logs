2020-10-08T12:45:42  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli, Justin_o - I've rolled a new release from my branch merged up with Justin_o's hyphenation fixes - 3.0.0-dev.20201007T193943Z.440be20ec.FLUID-6145
2020-10-08T12:46:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2020-10-08T12:46:40  <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2020-10-08T12:47:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: regarding FLUID-6538 where we are updating to the latest version of jQuery. Do you think it's worthwhile to go through and remove cases, where possible, where we are using deprecated jQuery functions.
2020-10-08T12:47:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure - what kinds of cases have you found?
2020-10-08T12:47:28  <Bosmon> And what is the state of your branch now?
2020-10-08T12:49:26  <Justin_o> The branch is waiting on the eslint config and fluid-grunt-lint-all prs to merged. As the linting will break currently
2020-10-08T12:49:28  <Justin_o> otherwise it's ready
2020-10-08T12:49:33  <Bosmon> Oh right, I see
2020-10-08T12:51:23  <Justin_o> in regards to deprecation I think it's some of the ways we are calling events, also I tried out the jQuery migrate https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/#readme on the inline edit demo and it came up with a bunch of other things probably related to https://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
2020-10-08T12:51:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2020-10-08T12:52:33  <Bosmon> Does the-t-in-rtf think that https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/pull/15/files is ready to go?
2020-10-08T12:52:43  <Bosmon> I guess when merged we would make this a 2.0.0 release
2020-10-08T12:52:53  <Bosmon> And I guess it would be wise to take a 1.x branch of the project from its current master
2020-10-08T12:53:59  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I guess if we can migrate them in a way that doesn't break stuff, we should do it : P
2020-10-08T12:54:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think the eslint-config-fluid should probably be merged first, followed by fluid-grunt-lint-all and versions and branches made as you suggest
2020-10-08T12:55:20  <Bosmon> Oh right
2020-10-08T12:55:35  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think the-t-in-rtf is waiting to see if the parallel infusion branch for addressing the linting is good and then the linting prs can be merged.
2020-10-08T12:55:50  <Bosmon> Oh right
2020-10-08T12:55:53  <Bosmon> It's all a bit circular : P
2020-10-08T12:56:38  <Justin_o> haha yes actually
2020-10-08T12:57:06  <Justin_o> there are about 4 related PRs
2020-10-08T12:57:07  <Bosmon> I'd say that given https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1013/files passes linting we should say that the others are good to go
2020-10-08T12:57:14  <Bosmon> Even if we find a few anomalies later
2020-10-08T12:57:25  <Bosmon> Obviously we can't actually merge https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1013/files until we have proper releases of all the others : P
2020-10-08T12:58:14  <Justin_o> sounds reasonable
2020-10-08T12:59:13  <Bosmon> I see you got around the global var issue by removing these lines completely: var fluid_3_0_0 = fluid_3_0_0 || {};
2020-10-08T12:59:56  <Justin_o> yes.. I figure in those cases they should already be include already. I've tried to only keep the cases where the file might be used without Fluid.js for example.
2020-10-08T13:00:02  <Bosmon> Does the linter really insist on all these blank lines?
2020-10-08T13:00:03  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1013/files#diff-eb23eba7203e400016bc578a4faf8ddbR352
2020-10-08T13:01:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a specific example you are referring to?
2020-10-08T13:02:09  <Bosmon> The one I linked there
2020-10-08T13:02:18  <Bosmon> It's inside Fluid.js
2020-10-08T13:03:04  <Justin_o> it was only opening the whole diff for me. let me try again.
2020-10-08T13:06:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the link isn't working. I think because Fluid.js starts collapsed in the diff on GitHub. Is there a line you can point me at?
2020-10-08T13:08:01  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yeah, there are a lot of extra blank comment lines such as at new lines 330, 340, 352, 378, 397, etc.
2020-10-08T13:08:18  <Justin_o> If you are referring to the single line space between the jsDoc description and @param. That isn't required, but I added them to try to make them more readable and consistent with other jsDoc blocks. We have a mixed use of style. There are some other things we may want to clean up later, like the use of `<code>` vs backticks
2020-10-08T13:09:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, those lines are as I mentioned above
2020-10-08T13:10:17  <Bosmon> ok
2020-10-08T13:11:20  <Justin_o> oh another thing to clean up later is how we specify optional parameters
2020-10-08T14:02:51  *** clown is now known as clown_afk
2020-10-08T14:58:54  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - I took the liberty of inviting sgithens to our tech checkin since I think we are discussing things that are of general interest to him
2020-10-08T15:01:30  <cindyli> sure, Bosmon. sgithens is very welcome
2020-10-08T15:04:04  <cindyli> Uttara: i'm not sure if you saw my email. i have some questions about the advisory panel page. i wonder if you  have time this afternoon to have a quick call to discuss?
2020-10-08T15:07:30  *** clown_afk is now known as clown
2020-10-08T15:11:21  <Uttara> Cindyli: I might have missed the email. Yes lets meet in the afternoon. Would 3 work?
2020-10-08T15:11:51  <cindyli> yes, Uttara. see you then in the wecount zoom room
2020-10-08T15:12:03  <Uttara> okay see you cindyli
2020-10-08T15:20:08  <clown> good morning, colinclark
2020-10-08T15:20:26  <clown> I'm about ready for a preferences server meeting, sometime tomorrow.
2020-10-08T15:20:48  <clown> You suggested Bosmon and cindyli atttend.
2020-10-08T15:20:57  <clown> Anyone else?  alanharnum, for example?
2020-10-08T15:21:53  <clown> Anyone that I've alerted by mentioning their names:  do you have a preferred time for said meeting (tomorrow)?
2020-10-08T15:30:20  <colinclark> hiya clown
2020-10-08T15:30:44  <colinclark> I think anyone who is interested, or you think would be good to have there, should be invited
2020-10-08T15:31:15  <colinclark> As for timing, 3 pm EDT is my preference tomorrow...
2020-10-08T15:31:23  <colinclark> but that might be a bit late for Bosmon, I’m not sure
2020-10-08T15:31:29  <colinclark> philip_ may be interested too
2020-10-08T15:31:34  <alanharnum> My meeting calendar is free tomorrow
2020-10-08T15:31:41  <alanharnum> so I can do any time that works for others
2020-10-08T15:31:50  <clown> yes, I was thinking the afternoon would not be good for Bosmon
2020-10-08T15:31:52  <colinclark> definitely Justin_o, because of the the IUI connection, but he may not be working on Friday
2020-10-08T15:32:02  <clown> but, it's up to him :-)
2020-10-08T15:32:10  <clown> standup!!!
2020-10-08T15:33:06  <Justin_o> colinclark, clown: I wasn't planning on working tomorrow. Depending on the time, I might be able to make it, but not sure. Let me know when you decide though.
2020-10-08T15:42:25  <Bosmon> I could possibly meet at 4pm EDT tomorrow but would prefer a morning slot some other day
2020-10-08T15:49:24  <clown> Bosmon, what other day?
2020-10-08T15:49:28  * clown maybe make a doodle poll…
2020-10-08T15:51:17  <Bosmon> Monday?
2020-10-08T15:52:11  <clown> Monday is a holiday here — Thanksgiving.
2020-10-08T15:52:17  <clown> Tuesday?
2020-10-08T15:56:47  <Justin_o> clown: I could do tuesday
2020-10-08T15:59:25  <clown> Justin_o:  the only day I can't do is next Friday, and I have meetings on Wed and Thu.  Tuesday is wide open at the moment.
2020-10-08T15:59:33  <clown> But, I'll make a doodle poll
2020-10-08T16:00:28  <Justin_o> clown: thanks, I'll fill the poll out
2020-10-08T16:18:05  <clown> fluid-everyone:  here is the poll for the preferences server meeting: https://doodle.com/poll/afhfmyfu2sy3vpvs
2020-10-08T16:19:04  <clown> and the calendar view, if that's your preference:  https://doodle.com/poll/afhfmyfu2sy3vpvs#calendar
2020-10-08T16:29:54  <gmoss> thanks, clown!
2020-10-08T16:30:09  <clown> no problem gmoss!
2020-10-08T17:36:14  <gmoss> clown: are we blocking your use of the standup room?
2020-10-08T17:36:27  <gmoss> we're just pairing, we can jump out
2020-10-08T17:40:44  <gmoss> all done with the room :)
2020-10-08T17:42:41  <clown> gmoss: sorry didn't see this.
2020-10-08T17:42:46  <clown> no, not blocking me.
2020-10-08T17:43:06  <clown> I just read Lorna's email and wanted to check it out.  I ended up using my zoom room
2020-10-08T17:43:44  <clown> And, I don't get what she means by "it has been applied to all IDRC staff.   "
2020-10-08T17:45:44  <gmoss> The ability to use a virtual background while logged in with your OCAD account is based on a setting that you have to change on the settings page on the Zoom website. When I did this for my account, I saw that it said something about the account owner being Alastair, so I'm betting there was previously a blanket setting to disable virtual backgrounds and that Lorna's request may have switched it to enable
2020-10-08T17:45:53  <gmoss> total speculation on my part, mind you ;)
2020-10-08T17:48:45  <clown> good as explanation gmoss.  Thanks
2020-10-08T17:49:00  <clown> good as *any ...
2020-10-08T19:03:04  <cindyli> Uttara: are you ready to meet? i'm in the wecount room
2020-10-08T19:03:59  <Uttara> cindyli: yes be right there
2020-10-08T20:16:17  <Uttara> cindyli: I made changes to the figma advisory page. DO you need the link to the photographs and the summery for every advisor?
2020-10-08T20:17:20  <cindyli> Uttara: yes. thanks
2020-10-08T20:41:51  <sgithens> Any suggested cylon party alternatives these days for hosting videos outside of youtube?
2020-10-08T20:49:15  <gmoss> sgithens: does Vimeo fit the bill? I'm not sure I get the BSG reference :P
2020-10-08T20:50:09  <sgithens> gmoss, oh yeah it totally would, it's been a while since I used anything so wasn't sure if there wasn't something better, more popular or something yet
2020-10-08T20:50:21  <sgithens> I'm not sure I understand the reference either
2020-10-08T20:50:52  <sgithens> but Bosmon had noted that I hadn't been to enough parties the other day when I mentioned i had no idea what Jamstack was (and actually thought it was a joke at first)
2020-10-08T20:51:44  <gmoss> sgithens: haha well I think we're all suffering from a bit of a party deficit, these days, so you're off the hook
2020-10-08T21:08:09  <cindyli> Uttara: do you have time to have a quick chat about the fix for badge images on mobile screens?
2020-10-08T21:25:01  <cindyli> Uttara: i'm going offline soon. i've created a github issue ticket for badge images: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/419, so you don't need to do it again. i've fixed the issue here - https://deploy-preview-420--wecount.netlify.app/badges/
2020-10-08T21:27:16  <cindyli> Uttara: could you take a look at the fix. please let me know if it's good enough. I guess you may find badge images look quite small now. this is because the proportion of text and image remain same as the desktop version, in this preview, the image take 12% of the width
2020-10-08T21:27:17  <cindyli> thanks
2020-10-08T21:32:07  <cindyli> btw, Uttara, i've created a github ticket for home page tiles so don't create one on your side - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/421
2020-10-08T21:44:30  <Uttara> cindyli: thanks I will have a look
2020-10-08T22:40:01  <Bosmon> gmoss - you remember the scene when Brother Cavil argues that someone couldn't be a proper Cylon because he hadn't seen them any of the good Cylon parties : P
2020-10-08T22:41:36  <gmoss> Gotcha :D I don't think I'd seen that far into the series, sadly
