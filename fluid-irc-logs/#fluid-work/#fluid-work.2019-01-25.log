2019-01-25T11:39:54  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: did you see me email last night?
2019-01-25T11:40:02  <jhernandez> any thoughts on it??
2019-01-25T11:41:30  <the-t-in-rtf> no, I decided to start the day working on tests and haven't looked up]
2019-01-25T11:41:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll check it now
2019-01-25T11:42:01  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: ok ok
2019-01-25T11:42:18  <jhernandez> I can give you a bit more of context if needed
2019-01-25T11:42:38  <the-t-in-rtf> my lunch just arrived, I'll ping you in a half hour?

2019-01-25T12:12:17  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @jhernandez, just to rule out the simple stuff, what version of JAWS do you have installed?
2019-01-25T12:18:09  <jhernandez> 2018
2019-01-25T12:18:27  <jhernandez> last one available at their website
2019-01-25T12:20:15  <the-t-in-rtf> And are you working with universal master?
2019-01-25T12:20:26  <the-t-in-rtf> (also, 2019 is available on their web site)
2019-01-25T12:20:38  <the-t-in-rtf> master is hard-coded for JAWS 2018
2019-01-25T12:20:59  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, check the version in the SR you have
2019-01-25T12:21:02  <the-t-in-rtf> and then check that folder
2019-01-25T12:21:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm assuming you did that, but wanted to ask if it was writing to the directory
2019-01-25T12:22:06  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, are you testing in bare iron, or in a VM?
2019-01-25T12:22:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because I did recently test JAWS in a Windows 10 VM with the settings in master
2019-01-25T12:23:04  <the-t-in-rtf> but it was long enough ago that if you're using the VM i can try firing that up to see if I can reproduce
2019-01-25T12:24:38  <the-t-in-rtf> also, I guess, what prefs set are you using?
2019-01-25T12:25:03  <the-t-in-rtf> and does JAWS launch itself?
2019-01-25T12:25:58  *** jhung1 <jhung1!~Adium@tnhlon4048w-lp140-01-76-70-92-165.dsl.bell.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-01-25T12:30:56  <jhernandez> yup
2019-01-25T12:31:11  <jhernandez> jaws 2018 + universal master
2019-01-25T12:31:48  <jhernandez> these are the prefs I'm using
2019-01-25T12:32:06  <jhernandez> a) quint: https://preferences.prd.gcp.gpii.net/preferences/129bc341-0025-417e-8107-cb567ab419d0
2019-01-25T12:32:41  <jhernandez> b) roy: https://preferences.prd.gcp.gpii.net/preferences/132922e6-569b-404c-9db2-c207544cc959
2019-01-25T12:32:54  <jhernandez> and yes, JAWS gets launched
2019-01-25T12:35:13  <jhernandez> to be more precise, I'm using a demo branch, but it's based on current master
2019-01-25T12:35:52  <jhernandez> here's the branch: https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/demo-ATIA-2019
2019-01-25T12:36:09  <jhernandez> the prefs are also included in that branch
2019-01-25T12:40:00  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2019-01-25T12:40:48  <jhernandez> so, to be clear, there are currently 2 problems
2019-01-25T12:42:08  <jhernandez> 1) Either a) we are not writing the settings in the right file OR b) JAWS is supposed to read from that file and is not working
2019-01-25T12:42:28  <the-t-in-rtf> what happens if you change settings in JAWS?
2019-01-25T12:42:33  <the-t-in-rtf> in the settings center?
2019-01-25T12:43:03  <jhernandez> 2) When we update the SR to use the folder $programData, it gets "half" configured
2019-01-25T12:43:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I think it pulls some stuff from there, those are the defaults
2019-01-25T12:43:27  <the-t-in-rtf> so you're basically clobbering the defaults I think
2019-01-25T12:43:41  <jhernandez> yeh, that's for sure
2019-01-25T12:43:42  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, try changing all the things in the settings center and see what gets updated
2019-01-25T12:44:01  <jhernandez> okay, let me try
2019-01-25T12:44:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I usually just whip down a panel changing a whole column, should be enough to show you what's up
2019-01-25T12:44:36  <the-t-in-rtf> you didn't answer bare iron vs. VM
2019-01-25T12:44:50  <the-t-in-rtf> on thought is that it's writing somewhere outside that roaming dir
2019-01-25T12:45:04  <the-t-in-rtf> s/on/one/
2019-01-25T12:45:11  <jhernandez> it is indeed writing in in the roaming dir
2019-01-25T12:45:25  <jhernandez> a.k.a.: $AppData
2019-01-25T12:45:30  <the-t-in-rtf> cool
2019-01-25T12:45:47  <the-t-in-rtf> what happens if you key in after that?
2019-01-25T12:46:20  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, just to clarify as we have a couple threads going
2019-01-25T12:46:33  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean JAWS is now reading/writing from somewhere else
2019-01-25T12:46:39  <jhernandez> I mean, this is what we're getting after keying-in
2019-01-25T12:46:45  <jhernandez> let me make that test
2019-01-25T12:46:48  <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2019-01-25T12:46:55  <jhernandez> I'm using the trial version and had to reboot the vm
2019-01-25T12:47:04  <the-t-in-rtf> supposedly we do have licenses
2019-01-25T12:47:13  <the-t-in-rtf> I think Eugene of GtM fame has them
2019-01-25T12:47:23  <the-t-in-rtf> or can get them if we need them
2019-01-25T12:50:12  <jhernandez> yes, changing settings from JAWS' interface stores the stuff in $AppData
2019-01-25T12:52:23  <the-t-in-rtf> so, do any of the settings get picked up?
2019-01-25T12:53:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I'd start with whatever JAWS setting you changed in the settings center and work from there
2019-01-25T12:53:17  <the-t-in-rtf> see what if anything is different
2019-01-25T12:53:52  <the-t-in-rtf> Oh.
2019-01-25T12:54:01  <the-t-in-rtf> And the keys are case sensitive
2019-01-25T12:54:09  <the-t-in-rtf> you should fix the ones that use lower case options
2019-01-25T12:55:00  <the-t-in-rtf> you have a mix of upper and lower
2019-01-25T12:55:08  <the-t-in-rtf> you might have an [options] block somewhere
2019-01-25T12:55:14  <the-t-in-rtf> which Jaws will probably ignore
2019-01-25T12:55:36  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-01-25T12:55:40  <the-t-in-rtf> also, your say all ignore shift keys setting is just wrong
2019-01-25T12:55:47  <the-t-in-rtf> that setting doesn't take true/false
2019-01-25T12:55:51  <the-t-in-rtf> 0 or 1
2019-01-25T12:55:54  <jhernandez> yeah, I didn't make those prefs
2019-01-25T12:56:10  <the-t-in-rtf> this sandwich I found on the street is terrible!
2019-01-25T12:56:19  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, don't take preferences from strangers, man
2019-01-25T12:56:20  <jhernandez> they came from sgithens via Bern
2019-01-25T12:56:22  <the-t-in-rtf> ha
2019-01-25T12:56:28  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, here's a good cheat sheet: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/jaws.json5#L96
2019-01-25T12:56:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I set each of those to a non-default value and I confirmed them working when I submitted the pull
2019-01-25T12:56:51  <jhernandez> and these 2 prefs worked in previous demos
2019-01-25T12:57:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I believe you
2019-01-25T12:57:20  <the-t-in-rtf> just pointing out things that I know probably won't work as expected based on recent experience
2019-01-25T12:57:40  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. probably SOME of the settings worked in previous demos
2019-01-25T12:57:40  <jhernandez> yeah, I had to take those two because there aren't prefs that use jaws other than "jaws"
2019-01-25T12:57:54  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, they'll need to be updated then
2019-01-25T12:58:04  <the-t-in-rtf> jaws was also hugely broken when I started working on that pull
2019-01-25T12:58:08  <jhernandez> I'd say that we should update them and get them merged into master
2019-01-25T12:58:09  <the-t-in-rtf> try the caps thing for starters
2019-01-25T12:58:47  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: will try, right? :P
2019-01-25T13:03:30  <jhernandez> we only need a prefSet that changes the synth language, speech rate and pitch - maybe provide different values than the default for things like punctuation verbosity or the like
2019-01-25T13:03:40  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: however, now it's working for me
2019-01-25T13:03:54  <jhernandez> how come?
2019-01-25T13:03:57  <jhernandez> magic?
2019-01-25T13:04:25  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: sorry, anything I should try?
2019-01-25T13:04:49  <jhernandez> does it mean that I need to perform a manual "save" in JAWS before being able to be configured by the GPII?
2019-01-25T13:04:52  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2019-01-25T13:06:35  <the-t-in-rtf> well, that was one of my theories
2019-01-25T13:06:56  <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps we expected JAWS to create that file
2019-01-25T13:07:03  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.122.106.129> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-25T13:07:03  <the-t-in-rtf> we should check to see if we're creating it ourselves
2019-01-25T13:07:12  <the-t-in-rtf> if you rename it and key in, what happens?
2019-01-25T13:07:46  <the-t-in-rtf> if the file is still created, then it's a failure to create the dir
2019-01-25T13:07:57  <the-t-in-rtf> which JAWS creates the first time you save settings
2019-01-25T13:08:04  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf:
2019-01-25T13:08:05  <jhernandez> right
2019-01-25T13:08:13  <jhernandez> it is indeed being created by JAWS
2019-01-25T13:08:20  <the-t-in-rtf> but JAWS creates both
2019-01-25T13:08:25  <the-t-in-rtf> so you need to also try renaming the dir
2019-01-25T13:08:33  <jhernandez> I already did it
2019-01-25T13:08:33  <the-t-in-rtf> our solution should be robust enough to create both as needed
2019-01-25T13:08:40  <jhernandez> that's why I know it
2019-01-25T13:08:41  <jhernandez> :)
2019-01-25T13:08:46  <the-t-in-rtf> cool
2019-01-25T13:08:50  <the-t-in-rtf> well, that's clear then
2019-01-25T13:09:09  <jhernandez> yeah, but now I no longer have a JAWS that recently got installed
2019-01-25T13:09:25  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I think we just need a mkdirp call somewhere in the ini file writing logic
2019-01-25T13:09:34  <the-t-in-rtf> or to understand why that didn't work
2019-01-25T13:09:45  <the-t-in-rtf> if there is code that should do that
2019-01-25T13:10:00  <jhernandez> I'll reinstall, clean folders etc and see what happens
2019-01-25T13:10:35  <jhernandez> what happened yesterday, related to "half" applied settings
2019-01-25T13:10:47  <jhernandez> I could see the voice profile "GPII"
2019-01-25T13:10:51  <jhernandez> but it wasn't the default one
2019-01-25T13:11:39  <javjarfer[m]> Trying here, I can confirm that caps make some settings work, and also that for changing language for synthesizer to one that doesn't match the UI language needs of the setting "Options.PrimaryLanguage" being set to the target language
2019-01-25T13:15:05  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: great, can you please send a pr with those changes for Quint against my demo-ATIA-2019 branch? https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/demo-ATIA-2019
2019-01-25T13:15:09  <the-t-in-rtf> good catch on that one

2019-01-25T16:54:58  <cindyli> Bosmon: in the meeting yesterday for fixing GPII-3651, the solution we thought was to enhance the matchmaker utility gpii.matchMakerFramework.utils.computeCapabilitiesFromSolution() to specially marked settingsHandlers that don't have matched capability path for preferences. After looking more into the code, this solution might be problematic because the lifecycle instructions are generated based on the received match maker output. t
2019-01-25T16:54:58  <cindyli> his code (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L447) shows, lifecycleInstructions are generated by the transformer based on matchMaker output "activeConfiguration.inferredConfiguration" block and solution registry.
2019-01-25T16:55:39  <cindyli> "activeConfiguration.inferredConfiguration" block from the match maker is correct in this case - https://pastebin.com/3f6kApu5
2019-01-25T16:56:36  <cindyli> so the planned solution of changing matchmaker is too early in the process because it doesn't generate any output that tells which settingsHandlers are matched or unmatched
2019-01-25T16:57:08  <cindyli> The transformer seems the right place to do settingsHandler filtering
2019-01-25T16:57:29  <cindyli> i'm going ahead with making changes to the transformer.

2019-01-25T16:58:15  <cindyli> Bosmon: if you feel the transformer is not the right place to do this filtering, please let me know
2019-01-25T16:59:07  <cindyli> thanks

2019-01-25T17:57:33  <Bosmon> cindyli - transformer could be good, but I think we were just more widely thinking we should just invoke collectInputPaths once and then use the information through the two different routes

2019-01-25T18:06:29  <cindyli> Bosmon: collectInputPaths is currently called by Matchmaker. with the untrusted config, the matchmaking is performed in the cloud. The generation of lifecycle instructions happens on the local flow manager. if we'd like to share the result of collectInputPaths, shall we add this result to the matchmaker output?

2019-01-25T18:46:31  <Bosmon> cindyli well it's ok to do it once per machine : P
2019-01-25T18:46:41  <Bosmon> I don't think it's worth adding this stuff to the payload
2019-01-25T18:46:57  <cindyli> ok, Bosmon
