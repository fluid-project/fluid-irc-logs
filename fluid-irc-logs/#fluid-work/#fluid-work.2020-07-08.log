2020-07-08T14:50:30  <Uttara> cindyli: Do you wanna meet after the webinar?
2020-07-08T14:53:45  *** clown is now known as clown_mtg
2020-07-08T14:54:14  <cindyli> Uttara: that's ok. yesterday i felt the hover/focus styles for "apply" and "reset buttons are a bit odd. but i think i will just follow the design, so we don't need to meet after the webinar
2020-07-08T17:11:21  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: does anyone have commit access to fluid-lab org? I need to merge a few PR's and would appreciate any help

2020-07-08T21:18:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: hello
2020-07-08T21:18:17  <Justin_o> are you online at the moment?
2020-07-08T21:18:38  <gmoss> Justin_o: yep!
2020-07-08T21:18:39  <gmoss> what's up?
2020-07-08T21:18:51  <Justin_o> were you the mentor for playtown and music-mania
2020-07-08T21:18:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: I was one of the mentors, yes
2020-07-08T21:19:06  <gmoss> and spifind
2020-07-08T21:19:10  <Justin_o> gmoss: can you remind me who mentored that project with you?
2020-07-08T21:19:15  <Justin_o> Jess, you and Alan?
2020-07-08T21:20:47  <gmoss> Justin_o: Jess and alanharnum for sure.I think danayo and michelled were also involved, if I recall correctly, but let me confirm this
2020-07-08T21:21:07  <gmoss> (michelled does that sound right?)
2020-07-08T21:21:24  <Justin_o> There's an Inclusive Game for Kids team for that GitHub org.. but there are no repos.. I assume that is the GSoC related project though
2020-07-08T21:21:33  <Justin_o> and I think we ran it for two students is that right?
2020-07-08T21:22:01  <michelled> I wasn't involved
2020-07-08T21:22:19  <gmoss> Justin_o: yes that was the project name for both students. michelled okay, thanks! sorry to disturb :)
2020-07-08T21:22:39  <michelled> no worries!
2020-07-08T21:23:20  <gmoss> Justin_o: danayo was indeed another mentor on that project
2020-07-08T21:23:24  <gmoss> 4 total
2020-07-08T21:23:45  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, I think we just didn't finish setting up the teams and etc for that, so I've done it now. You should have access to merge into those repos.
2020-07-08T21:23:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome! thanks :)
2020-07-08T21:23:58  <Justin_o> are you able to look at the PRs for gtirloni?
2020-07-08T21:24:16  <gmoss> Justin_o: I took a look this morning, but I'll double-check before merging
2020-07-08T21:24:43  <Justin_o> gmoss: great, thanks
2020-07-08T21:24:58  <gmoss> gtirloni: do you plan to containerize Spifind as well? I see you have a fork of that repo https://github.com/fluid-lab/spifind
