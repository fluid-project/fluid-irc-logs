2020-08-17T11:01:59  <greatislander> Hi gtirloni, still trying to track down this deployment issueâ€” do you have a couple moments?
2020-08-17T11:02:33  <greatislander> I'm just making more coffee but available whenever
2020-08-17T11:14:17  <gtirloni> greatislander: hey, I was looking at the code and I couldn't find something in the Python code that actually reads that environment variable
2020-08-17T11:14:49  <gtirloni> e.g. like the other stuff in cmdi/settings.py
2020-08-17T11:20:30  <greatislander> so the place where it needs to be read is in the `npm run build` script in the Dockerfile
2020-08-17T11:20:54  <greatislander> https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/blob/dev/Dockerfile#L11
2020-08-17T11:21:19  <greatislander> so I think that's the issue, we need to make sure those variables get passed to that script as well
2020-08-17T11:21:36  <greatislander> (accessible as `process.env.SOME_VAR`)
2020-08-17T11:21:39  <gtirloni> oh, I see
2020-08-17T11:21:55  <greatislander> is that a straightforward fix?
2020-08-17T11:23:38  <gtirloni> I'm not sure, just reviewing some build parameters to see if we can do that
2020-08-17T11:24:04  <greatislander> okay, thanks so much! let me know if there is anything else I can do to help
2020-08-17T11:24:13  <gtirloni> ok
2020-08-17T11:37:15  <gtirloni> greatislander: I tested a solution here that seems to work for me .. https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/pull/154/files
2020-08-17T11:37:51  <gtirloni> it uses Docker's ARGs to pass the information into the container during build time
2020-08-17T11:37:55  <greatislander> awesome!
2020-08-17T11:44:07  <gtirloni> did it work?
2020-08-17T11:46:46  <greatislander> like a charm! thanks so much, gtirloni :)
2020-08-17T11:46:52  <gtirloni> niice!
2020-08-17T14:31:29  <gmoss> jhung: are you around for our GSoC check-in?
2020-08-17T14:31:30  <dogeman> jhung it's time for the gsoc meeting
2020-08-17T14:31:52  <jhung> thanks! Be right tehre gmoss dogeman
2020-08-17T15:19:29  <gmoss> dogeman: the CONTRIBUTING.md still has a reference to port number 9778, can you please update that to 8080?
2020-08-17T15:19:29  <gmoss> Also, I meant to bring this up before, but the commit messages are a little obscure. When I make a commit, I like to give a sense of *why* a change was made or to give some historical context, since what was changed can be seen in the diff. I also recommend checking this out when you get a chance: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ :) (props to philip for showing me that write-up)
2020-08-17T15:52:54  *** jhung is now known as jhung_afk
2020-08-17T18:00:52  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-08-17T19:15:18  <dogeman> gmoss i updatedcontributing.md.
2020-08-17T19:15:35  <dogeman> Alright, will add the reason why a cimmit was made fromnow on.
2020-08-17T19:15:42  <dogeman> commit*
2020-08-17T19:17:27  <gmoss> dogeman: great, thanks :)
2020-08-17T19:17:43  <gmoss> for the commit messages, it's just something that takes practice. I'm still learning
2020-08-17T19:18:52  <gmoss> The main point is to imagine that you're another person returning to this code years from now, when you might not be around to answer any questions about the commit, and to be able to read the message and understand the purpose of the change :)
2020-08-17T19:19:15  <gmoss> (this is only one approach, there are many)
2020-08-17T19:20:24  <dogeman> Hmm, wll keep this in mind. Thanks :)
2020-08-17T19:25:18  <dogeman> jhung i made the requested changes
2020-08-17T19:26:03  <jhung> dogeman thanks. Will take a look.
2020-08-17T19:47:06  <gmoss> dogeman: I have a change to request in Fluid Project: the News template file is ending up in the output folder and is being served with the rest of the site (at `http://localhost:8080/YYYY-MM-DD-newsArticleName.html`). This isn't a critical problem, especially since there's no way to reach it, but if you can fix it that would be awesome!
2020-08-17T19:53:09  <dogeman> alright will figure it out
2020-08-17T19:56:23  <gmoss> Great, thanks!
2020-08-17T20:05:21  <dogeman> done gmoss
2020-08-17T20:05:41  <gmoss> dogeman: Awesome, checking now :)
2020-08-17T20:05:53  <dogeman> ok
2020-08-17T20:06:13  <gmoss> Looks like it's fixed!
2020-08-17T20:07:07  <dogeman> yes
