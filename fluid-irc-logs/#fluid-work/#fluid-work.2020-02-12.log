2020-02-12T16:38:09  <sgithens> cindyli: I'm setting up a fresh gpii-app VM to test saving settings, and I've forgotten exactly what I need to do to set up the client credentials again... I know I need to have a couch clientCredential document with isCreateGpiiKeyAllowed and isCreatePrefsSafeAllowed set to true, but I'm forgetting where the secret and clientId need to go in the gpii-app config... do we have a document with the setup steps again?

2020-02-12T16:40:17  <sgithens> cindyli: To be certain though, you can't just save settings out of the box if you `vagrant up` gpii-app, you do have to configure something along these lines correct?

2020-02-12T16:53:42  <the-t-in-rtf> @Shyamal, the best thing you can do is to try working with some of the underlying technologies.
2020-02-12T16:54:39  <the-t-in-rtf> The first among these is Infusion itself.
2020-02-12T16:54:47  <the-t-in-rtf> http://fluidproject.org/
2020-02-12T16:56:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I also left some suggested exercises on the project page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-02-12T16:57:01  <the-t-in-rtf> if you have questions, that's fine, part of getting to know each other is seeing how you make sense of new technologies and how well you ask for help and apply what you learn
2020-02-12T16:57:46  <the-t-in-rtf> FYI, @sgithens, this is very timely, I was just pasting my instructions for performing QA against a dev cloud
2020-02-12T16:57:52  <the-t-in-rtf> which include all the steps you were discussing
2020-02-12T16:57:56  <the-t-in-rtf> and more
