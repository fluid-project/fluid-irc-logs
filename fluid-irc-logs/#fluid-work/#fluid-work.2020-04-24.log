2020-04-24T14:10:00  <the-t-in-rtf> not liking the domino-like vibe that's building up on the webdriver issues
2020-04-24T14:10:25  <the-t-in-rtf> might have to rewrite the tests in Testem depending

2020-04-24T14:10:58  <sgithens> Are they similar at all? You'd have to restructure things quite a bit no?
2020-04-24T14:12:15  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but I've done it a few times
2020-04-24T14:12:33  <the-t-in-rtf> the first test is somewhat painful, and then you just get back into the rhythm

2020-04-24T17:05:26  <sgithens> stegru: Were you or javi planning on merging in the installer file size optimizations on? You used them to make the most recent installer right? So it's a lot smaller and runs faster?
2020-04-24T17:05:53  <sgithens> Just looking at gpii/gpii-wix-installer but didn't see any updates on the master or hst branches
2020-04-24T17:06:12  <sgithens> oh
2020-04-24T17:06:16  <stegru> sgithens, i know javi has been deduping and removing redundant things
2020-04-24T17:06:31  <stegru> try the GPII-4004 branch.. that's the "official" one
2020-04-24T17:07:03  <sgithens> off of javi's repo or yours?
