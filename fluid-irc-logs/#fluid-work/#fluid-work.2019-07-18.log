2019-07-18T19:39:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I've been doing exploration into those random test failures we are seeing with the syllabification tests. I added a JIRA, which I'll update shortly, but from what I can tell it's actually related to this line https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactorTests.js#L276
2019-07-18T19:39:51  <Justin_o> with childNode being undefined
2019-07-18T19:40:18  *** jhung <jhung!~jhung@205.211.168.103> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2019-07-18T19:40:20  <Justin_o> I can't quite figure out why it's undefined in some cases though.
2019-07-18T19:42:14  <Justin_o> It's probably somehow related to the syllabification, which is applying the markup to split up the words into syllables. However, when I added a listener to log the HTML, it appeared that this was done before the above line of code executed. Perhaps the nodeList isn't populated yet, but I'm not sure there is any way to actually determine that. Do you have any thoughts?
2019-07-18T19:47:45  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can't see how that line would be responsible
2019-07-18T19:47:49  <Bosmon> All it could do is cause a test failure
2019-07-18T19:47:53  <Bosmon> Rather than an endless hang
2019-07-18T19:48:51  <Justin_o> well an exception is thrown in the console, I think it might just be stopping the execution of the script there
2019-07-18T19:49:37  <Justin_o> it happens in this sequence https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactorTests.js#L202-L205
2019-07-18T19:50:21  <Justin_o> Not exactly sure how these sequences wait for things, but I'm guessing that what ever tells it to keep going doesn't happen.
2019-07-18T19:50:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the only "thing that would keep it going" is whether the afterSyllabification event fires or not
2019-07-18T19:51:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that does fire, or the error wouldn't even be hit
2019-07-18T19:51:19  <Justin_o> and I used that event output the markup to the console too
2019-07-18T19:51:59  <Bosmon> Justin_o - right, well I think there's no way that the sequence can hang because of a problem at that line, without a test failure too
2019-07-18T19:52:04  <Bosmon> Does no test failure appear in the logs?
2019-07-18T19:53:27  <Justin_o> I don't think so. I don't think the test actually completes though. I'll try to reproduce it again. I've switched to another machine right now, so need to setup a few things. However, I was able to reproduce locally just by running the syllabificationEnactor tests. Although it was still only randomly happening
