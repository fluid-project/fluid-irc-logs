2019-04-26T23:06:10  <sgithens> Bosmon the-t-in-rtf : just to follow up from earlier in the week. When I'm writing a test like this, now using the premade configs, how do I actually reference the components from the system in the sequence? Especially in an instance such as this where it's starting both cloud and local flowmanagers? How would you reference a component from the local flowManager vs the cloud one (or anyone at, as this lookup currently
2019-04-26T23:06:10  <sgithens> isn't working)  https://gist.github.com/sgithens/f5501a58ac55058016675e73eee9f9a3
2019-04-26T23:07:02  <sgithens> in this specific case I'd like to grab the local flowmanager that has a device reporter and stuff
2019-04-26T23:42:25  <Bosmon> sgithens - you can just reference it via its full grade
2019-04-26T23:42:29  <Bosmon> Which you should really be doing anyway
