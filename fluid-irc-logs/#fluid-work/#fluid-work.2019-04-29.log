2019-04-29T15:49:17  <alanharn_> jhung: I believe the best solution for DocPad we've found so far has been from the-t-in-rtf's work, which is to stop using DocPad as a global install, and pin it to the last version that our dependent plugins work with (6.79.4): https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6324?focusedCommentId=40439&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40439
2019-04-29T15:49:47  *** alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum2
2019-04-29T15:49:59  <jhung> ok alanharnum2 I'll give that a try.

2019-04-29T16:51:01  <gmoss> cindyli: ahead of our pairing, here's my latest in a non-working state: https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/commit/3fbf5f0c41f831d67d44f6950ab5273540deea4b
2019-04-29T16:51:01  <gmoss> what I expect is the model relay to activate and update the editor's model. once you run the server, go to http://localhost:8081/tests/html/storyTelling-page-storyEdit-Tests.html to see
2019-04-29T16:57:37  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhung, a key tip is that npm scripts work really well with binaries coming from dependencies.
2019-04-29T16:57:52  <the-t-in-rtf> in many cases you can just use the same "docpad arg1 arg2" syntax with literally no changes
2019-04-29T16:57:57  <the-t-in-rtf> it handles the pathing for you.
2019-04-29T16:58:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, as long as you're calling docpad from npm scripts, like we do with the infusion docs.

2019-04-29T17:01:18  <cindyli> great. thanks, gmoss. will have a look soon
2019-04-29T17:02:26  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks! :) would it be okay to push our pairing back to 3 PM? I'm meant to meet a friend for lunch today and they're running late. I'm working on the test sequence element that's commented out, in the meantime
2019-04-29T17:02:34  <gmoss> (which also had issues :))
2019-04-29T17:02:38  <cindyli> sure, no problem
2019-04-29T17:02:43  <gmoss> thanks cindyli!
2019-04-29T17:05:43  <jhung> thanks the-t-in-rtf. I'll keep that in mind. I'll try to get to trying this tomorrow.

2019-04-29T17:29:16  <colinclark> simonjb, michelled: I made another round of edits to the movie script, hopefully they’re already.
2019-04-29T17:29:27  <colinclark> hopefully they’re alright, sorry
2019-04-29T17:30:01  <colinclark> My goal was to just use slightly simpler, more conversational language

2019-04-29T20:59:17  <sgithens> Bosmon: Do you think the PSP is actually not going to be used anymore?
2019-04-29T20:59:26  <sgithens> Like... for reals?
2019-04-29T21:00:19  <sgithens> I have these buttons in the PPT that control metadata related to it... which my initial reaction would be to just temporarily remove them from the UI since we seem to switch directions a lot
2019-04-29T21:00:56  <sgithens> but if it seems likely that we really actually aren't going to use it again, I can just take them flat out

2019-04-29T21:11:06  <Bosmon> It's been scheduled to be abolished for months
2019-04-29T21:11:29  <Bosmon> The only reason it wasn't deleted was that Gregg didn't want to risk destabilising the system
2019-04-29T21:12:48  <sgithens> so it's been long enough
2019-04-29T21:12:56  <Bosmon> Yes
