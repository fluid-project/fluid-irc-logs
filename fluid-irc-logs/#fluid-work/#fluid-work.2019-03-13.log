2019-03-13T12:57:46  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - this probably a genuine error/mismatch
2019-03-13T12:58:19  <Bosmon> The real failure occurs on line 872
2019-03-13T12:58:34  <Bosmon> The system tries to log in with an "invalid" GPII key, but as a result of Cindy's recent improvements, this is no longer an error
2019-03-13T12:58:48  <the-t-in-rtf> ah
2019-03-13T12:58:52  <Bosmon> So I think in this case best resolved by simply removing the test
2019-03-13T12:58:56  <the-t-in-rtf> will do
2019-03-13T12:59:29  <the-t-in-rtf> so.
2019-03-13T12:59:38  <the-t-in-rtf> just to confirm, that's the only test in that suite
2019-03-13T12:59:43  <the-t-in-rtf> so, remove the whole file?
2019-03-13T13:00:27  <the-t-in-rtf> or can we do something that results in a meaningful error along the same lines?
2019-03-13T13:00:36  <the-t-in-rtf> like an invalid username/password?
2019-03-13T13:00:52  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm.

2019-03-13T13:01:08  <Bosmon> We should test the case where no connection can be made to the preferences server at all
2019-03-13T13:01:19  <Bosmon> Which is one of the few ways left to provoke a user error
2019-03-13T13:01:28  <Bosmon> This should be simple enough by just configuring it to listen on the wrong port
2019-03-13T13:02:16  <the-t-in-rtf> so create a gpii.tests.dev.config.missingPrefsServer config or the like?
2019-03-13T13:03:26  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that sounds right
2019-03-13T13:03:48  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the relevant JIRA for cindyli's recent work is https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3721
2019-03-13T13:04:29  <Bosmon> But we need not refer to it if we just cleanly turn this into a "can't contact prefs server" test

2019-03-13T13:06:51  <cindyli> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf, starting flow manager config only will create an environment without a prefs server. a similar test case in the universal - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/cloud/CloudStatusTests.js#L29-L32
2019-03-13T13:07:47  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, cindy.
2019-03-13T13:07:51  <cindyli> np
2019-03-13T13:08:05  <the-t-in-rtf> but if it's all the same to you, I'd rather break the devil I know than start over with a new one
2019-03-13T13:08:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we can talk about it in the review, and I will look at the link to see
2019-03-13T13:08:55  <Bosmon> Yes
2019-03-13T13:08:56  <cindyli> sure. do whatever makes more sense to you
2019-03-13T13:09:10  <Bosmon> You could just write a distribution in the test case to fiddle the port if you like
2019-03-13T13:14:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I did so, but in a clearly named config.
2019-03-13T13:14:46  <Bosmon> v.good
2019-03-13T13:14:47  <the-t-in-rtf> and the tests now pass

2019-03-13T15:12:58  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - we're just tracking down the last test case failure in gpii-app
2019-03-13T15:13:10  <Bosmon> A frequent cause of failure (3 times in 5) is now this kind of thing - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/100
2019-03-13T15:13:29  <Bosmon> It seems somehow there is a strange route whereby a session could start without a valid "createTime" field
2019-03-13T15:13:45  <Bosmon> Can you think of a way this could happen, or perhaps be caused by some recent work on the LifecycleManager?

2019-03-13T15:53:33  <Bosmon> The system is in the middle of "gpii.lifecycleManager.processActionQueue", but actually the relevant session has already been "destroyed"
2019-03-13T15:54:20  <Bosmon> It then processes {lifecycleManager}.events.onSessionSnapshotUpdate when there is actually no session
2019-03-13T15:54:35  <Bosmon> I am thinking that this is another of the unwelcome side-effects in destroying the dynamic session component in the LifecycleManager

2019-03-13T15:55:21  <Bosmon> This was one of the reasons I was recommending you to actually destroy the session component in between sessions

2019-03-13T16:00:55  <cindyli> Bosmon: i'm in a meeting right now. will catch up more later. what do you mean by "destroy the session component in between sessions"
2019-03-13T16:02:26  <Bosmon> cindyli - to make the session a "createOnEvent" subcomponent of the LifecycleManager, rather than a static one
2019-03-13T16:02:35  <Bosmon> Such that it actually got fully destroyed
2019-03-13T16:02:43  <Bosmon> As far as I can see, the point of test case failure is here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/PspTestDefs.js#L212
2019-03-13T16:03:10  <Bosmon> I think what is happening is that the tests react to an onSettingUpdated message, and then fairly soon triggers a key-out
2019-03-13T16:04:29  <Bosmon> Ah no, it is a change in preference set
2019-03-13T16:04:45  <Bosmon> Which then triggers a change in settings, but the user keys out whilst the change in settings is still in progress
2019-03-13T16:04:52  <Bosmon> I think this actually represents a real failure mode of the real system

2019-03-13T16:24:57  <the-t-in-rtf> great
2019-03-13T16:31:52  <cindyli1> Bosmon: meeting's over. thanks for the investigation. i see what you mean. in the jira you mentioned "we could perform checks via fluid.isDestroyed() rather than some ad hoc mechanism", do you think if it's ok to provide a lifecycle manager API isUserSessionDestroyed() to substitute fluid.isDestroyed() to deal with this case?
2019-03-13T16:32:15  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2019-03-13T16:32:24  <Bosmon> cindyli - this isn't an API issue, it is that the impl is broken
2019-03-13T16:32:35  <Bosmon> Any mechanisms we provided for checking the session would be primarily for our own use
2019-03-13T16:39:30  <cindyli> Bosmon: you are right, providing another API may not be enough. but i also doubt if having userSession onCreateEvent would solve the problem.  {gpii.lifecycleManager}.events.onSessionSnapshotUpdate.fire is called when the system is restored to original settings. this is a part of the keyout action. setting createTime to "undefined" is in the callback of restorePromise - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4ca4ebfc25fe0eff25c93a663

2019-03-13T16:40:05  <cindyli> i suspect the destroyed userSession was caused by the destroy of GPII when the test sequence completes
2019-03-13T16:41:59  <cindyli> anyway, i can write a universal test in the sequence you described in JIRA to see if this issue is reproducible in your theroy

2019-03-13T16:58:02  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon , good afternoon, I have reached this issue while trying to apply a defaultDestop background to the default GPII-App settings
2019-03-13T16:58:02  <javjarfer[m]> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3792
2019-03-13T16:58:28  <javjarfer[m]> I don't know if settings application order is something we have plan to support at all

2019-03-13T17:00:23  <jhernand_> heads up: arch meeting time!
2019-03-13T17:03:07  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the intention is that this is supported by attaching multiple separate settingsHandler blocks to the same solution
2019-03-13T17:03:18  <Bosmon> The system will guarantee to serialise the application of these
2019-03-13T17:06:49  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, I know, but in this case, the conflicting settings are represented in different solutions, as the conflicting part is a consequence of a setting, and not directly a setting we expose.
2019-03-13T17:07:48  <javjarfer[m]> you suggest we should join this settings into a unified solution like "com.microsoft.windows.personalization"?
2019-03-13T17:08:59  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - oh, that is very interesting
2019-03-13T17:09:02  <Bosmon> Sorry I misunderstood
2019-03-13T17:09:13  <Bosmon> Yes, we certainly need to apply "priority" annotations for solutions
2019-03-13T17:09:32  <Bosmon> I think we had already filed this issue
2019-03-13T17:18:40  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: then sorry for the issue duplication, I didn't found the other one
2019-03-13T17:20:11  <cindyli> javjarfer[m], Bosmon: is it this one - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3759
2019-03-13T17:20:13  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that's fine, there are thousands of JIRAs : P
2019-03-13T17:20:20  <Bosmon> cindyli I linked it on the issue already
2019-03-13T17:20:31  <cindyli> cool.
2019-03-13T17:21:48  <javjarfer[m]> oh, great, thanks Bosmon , cindyli , let me know if I can help with something

2019-03-13T17:55:28  <cindyli> Bosmon: i reproduced the gpii-app test failure on my machine and looked into it. this is the log i captured with a bigger log buffer - https://pastebin.com/XbZVdSBm. at line 120, you can see the prefs update that was rejected is the turning off of magnification rather than changing the magnification to another value. this turning-off is a part of the keyout process and the failure is because the test sequence reaches the end and is k
2019-03-13T17:55:28  <cindyli> illing GPII when the keyout is still in process
2019-03-13T17:55:47  <cindyli> i added a little timeout at the end of the test sequence https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-app/compare/GPII-3744...cindyli:GPII-3744#diff-9fcf07c8eddee015cbfaf4094980c016R217
2019-03-13T17:56:10  <cindyli> to give a bit more time for the keyout to complete
2019-03-13T17:56:14  <cindyli> this fixes the test failure
2019-03-13T17:56:31  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I think all of my "wait for child component" strategies were basically an overly complicated timeout
2019-03-13T17:56:38  <cindyli> so i don't think making userSession a dynamic component will help with the fix at all
2019-03-13T18:00:04  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i agree. what's the best way to deal with this situation when GPII is tearing down.? do we expect any ongoing actions don't complaint and just quit silently?
2019-03-13T18:01:16  <cindyli> i'm not sure that is a right response?

2019-03-13T18:49:01  <the-t-in-rtf> IMO we should be able to finish all conversations in flight with at least an error response.
2019-03-13T18:49:29  <the-t-in-rtf> tests kind of exercise things in a way the system itself usually doesn't, lots of activity and frequent shutdowns, so it's kind of an artificial situation

2019-03-13T18:50:35  <the-t-in-rtf> we can add checks to avoid dealing with destroyed material or performing actions after shutdown, but on reflection, if the problem is mainly seen in tests, the solution is really to ensure that we have hooks where we can wait for things to be safe
2019-03-13T18:50:41  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. that we can wait for activity to complete
