2020-05-28T01:10:03  <sachin10101998> Justin_o Are you there?
2020-05-28T01:16:24  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'm sort of here, but won't be here for long
2020-05-28T01:16:40  <sachin10101998> Just wanted to update that I migrated fluid project too.
2020-05-28T01:16:52  <sachin10101998> what should I do next
2020-05-28T01:17:11  <sachin10101998> I've sent the PR too
2020-05-28T01:19:40  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: thanks for that. I guess next steps will be co-ordinating with gmoss, jhung, and colinclark about code review. I don't fully remember what the project plan was, in terms of next steps.
2020-05-28T01:20:02  <Justin_o> I believe colinclark wanted to redesign the fluid project site, so there will be some work there, but not sure the timeline for that.
2020-05-28T01:20:48  <Justin_o> we'll also have to do a final look over the open PRs for those sites to make sure everything is in order, but thanks for doing a first pass. I saw some comments that you left.
2020-05-28T01:20:51  <sachin10101998> Addition of CMS and CI/CD. Although colin wasn't really sure of whether we need cms yet. should I add github actions workflow ? I have already created them. Just need to push
2020-05-28T01:21:46  <sachin10101998> Not a problem. I'd review rest of PRs too in the meantime. I'll wait for jhung and gmoss to come online and discuss what to do next as I really don't want to commit the github actions in the same PR
2020-05-28T01:21:56  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: maybe check in with gtirloni tomorrow to see what his plans are for hosting the sites. We may need to switch things up.
2020-05-28T01:22:29  <sachin10101998> Alright. Does he too come online as per EDT working hours?
2020-05-28T01:23:18  <Justin_o> Regarding CI/CD, since you have extra time, maybe look into some automated testing that we could add as part of that. e.g. broken links, css linting, html validation, performance reports and etc.
2020-05-28T01:23:45  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: yes, he usually works around that time, although his schedule may be different from time to time
2020-05-28T01:23:46  <sachin10101998> Testing integrated in Github actions, right?
2020-05-28T01:23:59  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: yes
2020-05-28T01:24:13  <sachin10101998> seems cool. I'd see how read about it.
2020-05-28T01:25:06  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: take a look through the issues for the wecount site, there were some things mentioned there https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca
2020-05-28T01:25:41  <sachin10101998> regarding improvements?
2020-05-28T01:25:56  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: sorry, no, regarding ideas for testing tools that you could explore.
2020-05-28T01:26:17  <Justin_o> there are some "Tooling" related Issues filed there that might provide some ideas of things to test and tools to explore.
2020-05-28T01:26:23  <Justin_o> There may be others as well
2020-05-28T01:26:37  <sachin10101998> Alright. I'd go through them too. Thanks a lot.
2020-05-28T01:30:08  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: also, did you see Yash's e-mail to the fluid-work e-mail list. Feel free to provide some feedback if you have ideas about that as well.
2020-05-28T01:31:46  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'll be heading off now, but hopefully that will give you a few things to look at in the meantime.

2020-05-28T11:47:23  <stegru> Justin_o, could you check if it looks ok?
2020-05-28T11:49:33  <Justin_o> stegru: sure
2020-05-28T11:50:46  <stegru> you can review it, because you know most about this type of thing, then @ Bosmon or jhernandez for the merge

2020-05-28T15:23:59  <sachin10101998> jhung colinclark gmoss Justin_o greatislander Could you review https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/56. Also Justin_o said that we have to review he pending PRs before we start merging 11ty code . Can I help with that somehow to accelerate the process? Also should I start working on integration of Netlify-CMS or would we want to look into staticman more?
2020-05-28T15:26:07  <sachin10101998> Also jhung, there is a blog folder in the fluid project website repo , but those posts are nowhere shown on fluidproject.org website. do you want to kee them in the repo or can we do away with them?
2020-05-28T15:26:10  <jhung> sachin10101998 thanks! I'll take a look at it when I can today or tomorrow.
2020-05-28T15:29:09  <jhung> sachin10101998 that's a good question. I think we should migrate the documents even if they're not being rendered to the public-facing site. I wonder if it makes sense to make them appear as old news articles so at least they're accessible through that timeline. colinclark do you have any thoughts?
2020-05-28T15:29:36  <colinclark> hmm, interesting
2020-05-28T15:29:40  <colinclark> what do the pages actually contain?
2020-05-28T15:29:48  <sachin10101998> Some old blogs
2020-05-28T15:29:49  <jhung> Blog posts in question are here: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/tree/master/src/documents/blog colinclark
2020-05-28T15:30:00  <colinclark> ooooh
2020-05-28T15:30:19  <colinclark> this is an archive of the old Fluid Project Wordpress blog!
2020-05-28T15:30:26  <jhung> Yeah!
2020-05-28T15:30:32  <colinclark> I’ve always wondered if we still had these! :)
2020-05-28T15:30:41  <sachin10101998> I've excluded them from eleventy processing for now.
2020-05-28T15:30:53  <colinclark> hmmm
2020-05-28T15:31:00  <colinclark> let me think about this for a few minutes
2020-05-28T15:31:07  <colinclark> they’re largely historical
2020-05-28T15:31:12  <colinclark> but i like history :)
2020-05-28T15:31:25  <colinclark> i almost wonder if they could just go into the wiki
2020-05-28T15:34:11  <sachin10101998> For now, they are present in the repo but do not have any permalinks
2020-05-28T15:34:20  <colinclark> jhung: here’s the interesting question...
2020-05-28T15:34:29  <colinclark> when, in this process, should we redesign the site?
2020-05-28T15:34:43  <colinclark> It seems to me that we should get a nice stable port to 11ty first
2020-05-28T15:34:56  <colinclark> but maybe before worrying about CMS, etc., we should consider the new infromation architecture and content?
2020-05-28T15:35:15  <sachin10101998> I've sent PRs for migration of both the sites . We can go ahead once they are reviewed and merged
2020-05-28T15:36:35  <Justin_o> colinclark, gtirloni: are we planning to change where the hosting of the sites are. That might be something that could be done  in the short term, along with the 11ty port.
2020-05-28T15:36:48  <sachin10101998> gtirloni is away
2020-05-28T15:36:51  <colinclark> well
2020-05-28T15:36:59  <colinclark> let’s say yes, sort of
2020-05-28T15:37:07  <colinclark> I mean, we’ll always still have our own infrastructure
2020-05-28T15:37:23  <sachin10101998> colinclark I have github actions workflow ready to push but should I push them in the same PR?
2020-05-28T15:38:14  <sachin10101998> gmoss said that we'd be migrating from Jenkins to Github actions in one of his initial mails after the programme started.
2020-05-28T15:38:41  <colinclark> what’s going to change in that regard is that our infrastructure won’t be hosted on our own physical servers
2020-05-28T15:39:11  <colinclark> we’ll move everything currently in the OCADU data centre to AWS or Azure
2020-05-28T15:39:30  <sachin10101998> Why so, though?
2020-05-28T15:39:30  <colinclark> but we might well also just chose to host our static sites with Netlify
2020-05-28T15:40:03  <colinclark> yeah, we should definitely be using Github Actions wherever possible
2020-05-28T15:40:20  <colinclark> I think we won’t quite be able to shut off our Jenkins server, but I hope we can get very close :)
2020-05-28T15:40:28  <sachin10101998> I see.
2020-05-28T15:40:30  <Bosmon> colinclark - amazing - perhaps it means that this absurd blog posting will one day return : https://fluidproject.org/blog/2008/07/21/about-this-and-that/
2020-05-28T15:40:31  <colinclark> we’re moving to the cloud for various reasons
2020-05-28T15:40:35  <colinclark> cheaper, etc.
2020-05-28T15:40:50  <colinclark> the source code of it is clearly there, Bosmon
2020-05-28T15:40:52  <sachin10101998> yeah right
2020-05-28T15:41:24  <Justin_o> colinclark, sachin10101998: the netlify deploys of PRs is also really handy
2020-05-28T15:42:21  <sachin10101998> Netlify will simplify things a lot but again it's not FOSS

2020-05-28T15:44:44  *** kasparnet <kasparnet!~kasper2@193.89.98.158> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2020-05-28T15:45:39  <sachin10101998> Bosmon were you referring to this link https://fluidproject.org/blog/2008-07-21-about-this-and-that.html?
2020-05-28T15:46:52  <colinclark> sachin10101998: But Netlify is a very good short to medium term option
2020-05-28T15:47:05  <Bosmon> Oh wow it is still there
2020-05-28T15:47:08  <Bosmon> How can it be : P
2020-05-28T15:47:29  <colinclark> What I dream of in the longer term is that gtirloni will be able to come up with some tools that we can host in our own infrastructure that can replicate the parts of Netlify we like best
2020-05-28T15:48:07  <sachin10101998> Bosmon: The blog posts are there but the links are different. Docpad rendered them as expected but the links to these are not available on website
2020-05-28T15:48:31  <Bosmon> Oh I see
2020-05-28T15:48:41  <Bosmon> Well, very funny all the same
2020-05-28T15:48:52  <Bosmon> Btw do not follow any of the opinions in this posting : P
2020-05-28T15:49:03  <sachin10101998> haha I was actually going through it
2020-05-28T15:49:31  <Bosmon> It's remarkable how almost every point in it is in one way or another entirely wrong
2020-05-28T15:49:59  <sachin10101998> colinclark: so what should i really work upon now?
2020-05-28T15:50:22  <colinclark> Bosmon: lol
2020-05-28T15:50:30  <colinclark> well, i guess that tells us what we want to do with the old posts ;)
2020-05-28T15:50:42  <sachin10101998> Bosmon: the blog was written in 2008. It's maazing to see how long you guys have been around.
2020-05-28T15:51:02  <Bosmon> sachin10101998 - if we succeed in being around for a further 12 years we might actually achieve something : P
2020-05-28T15:51:16  <colinclark> sachin10101998: Could you create a “Fluid Archive” page in the wiki, and move the text of these hidden blog posts into child pages of it?
2020-05-28T15:51:25  <colinclark> and then we can remove those from your 11ty PR if you haven’t already
2020-05-28T15:51:45  <sachin10101998> lol that's a lot of achievements already in your bucket
2020-05-28T15:52:11  <Bosmon> Unfortunately in 2008 we weren't even capable of formulating the important questions to answer, and most of the questions that are answered in this posting are answered wrongly
2020-05-28T15:52:26  <sachin10101998> colinclark: By wiki you mean https://wiki.fluidproject.org/, right?
2020-05-28T15:52:44  <colinclark> yup
2020-05-28T15:52:48  <colinclark> sachin10101998: also, did you already do the GA automation for this site?
2020-05-28T15:53:00  <sachin10101998> yes, I did
2020-05-28T15:53:31  <sachin10101998> https://github.com/sachin10101998/floeproject.org/actions/runs/115232253

2020-05-28T15:54:52  <sachin10101998> Bosmon: Do you guys still write blogs on related topic like this now though?
2020-05-28T15:54:54  <Bosmon> To start with, i) "that-ism" is manifestly a bucket less performant than all the other options, ii) the "Prototype hijacking" facility of this-ism is actually precisely the kind of capability that we *do* want, and iii) and "regaining the 3rd leg of encapsulation" is exactly what we don't want
2020-05-28T15:55:12  <Bosmon> sachin10101998 - we no longer have the huge expanses of time we had in the decade before last : P
2020-05-28T15:55:24  <Bosmon> It's hard enough just keeping on top of the backlog of 10 years of urgent work
2020-05-28T15:55:31  <sachin10101998> haha
2020-05-28T15:56:11  <Bosmon> We do write papers though
2020-05-28T15:56:33  <sachin10101998> papers as in research papers?
2020-05-28T15:56:35  <Bosmon> You can see a bunch in here: https://github.com/amb26/papers
2020-05-28T15:56:39  <colinclark> that’s one of the things i want to highlight on the new Fluid Project site, Bosmon
2020-05-28T15:57:03  <Bosmon> In case you are interested, the first really usefully modern one is this: https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/ppig-2016a/ppig2016a.pdf
2020-05-28T15:57:38  <Bosmon> Although this one also contains several important ideas which are still not delivered on: https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/ppig-2015/ppig-2015-basman.pdf
2020-05-28T15:57:44  <colinclark> I want to restructure it around the idea of a “community of practice for co-design and participatory technologies”
2020-05-28T15:58:19  <sachin10101998> Bosmon: I've starred the repo and would go through them. Thanks for sharing
2020-05-28T15:58:22  <colinclark> and have a section that discusses what’s unique about our approach to technology, with links to papers and other things
2020-05-28T16:00:06  <Bosmon> colinclark - that sounds great
2020-05-28T16:00:16  <sachin10101998> Justin_o How does the fluid wiki work though? Is it similar to having a git repo to push stuff to?
2020-05-28T16:00:34  <colinclark> A new Infusion page that describes it not as a product, but as a long-term research practice
2020-05-28T16:00:37  <Bosmon> If only the site would allow ourselves to have conversations with our selves from 12 years ago and save ourselves a lot of time : P
2020-05-28T16:00:39  <colinclark> etc.

2020-05-28T16:00:56  <colinclark> sachin10101998: Can you add a time machine feature to the website?
2020-05-28T16:01:01  <colinclark> that shouldn’t take much work at all, I think
2020-05-28T16:01:16  <sachin10101998> haha am afraid that's really out of my expertise for now.
2020-05-28T16:01:20  <Bosmon> I mean, it doesn't need to send *us* back in time, it just needs to send our PRs back in time
2020-05-28T16:01:24  <Bosmon> That would be quite sufficient
2020-05-28T16:01:39  <sachin10101998> Well, we can just change the commit dates , if that's what you want
2020-05-28T16:01:43  <Bosmon> hahahaha
2020-05-28T16:04:35  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: the wiki isn't really a repo although it has versioning. It is a Confluence instance. You'll need to create an account there before you can add content.
2020-05-28T16:05:18  <sachin10101998> I do see a create blog posts and blank pages section there.
2020-05-28T16:05:33  <sachin10101998> Would I need some access rights to post after writing them?
2020-05-28T16:05:49  <sachin10101998> (I've created an account there)
2020-05-28T16:08:03  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I think you should be able to create pages.
2020-05-28T16:08:52  <sachin10101998> colinclark wanted a subsection on the old blog posts. If I create blog posts individually, is there a way to cluster them up somewhere. Or provide a lit of them as it's there in the left hand column of wiwki?
2020-05-28T16:13:17  <sachin10101998> And does the editor support markdown or html tags?
2020-05-28T16:22:27  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: are you looking at a specific page at the moment, if so, could you send me a link
2020-05-28T16:22:44  *** philip <philip!~philip@142.118.77.87> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2020-05-28T16:22:50  <sachin10101998> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/
2020-05-28T16:23:10  <sachin10101998> there's a column on left showing About, Projects, Past Projects, Resources
2020-05-28T16:23:19  <sachin10101998> At the bottom there's a child pages link
2020-05-28T16:23:26  <sachin10101998> In the same column
2020-05-28T16:24:03  <sachin10101998> There are around 46 child pages link under the Fluid Project Wiki
2020-05-28T16:24:37  <sachin10101998> I was looking for making something like that. where instead of "Fluid roject Wiki" we could name it Blog Archives or something and then have the blog posts under it.
2020-05-28T16:25:02  <sachin10101998> I've removed the blog folder from my PR as discussed above
2020-05-28T16:25:55  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I think it can just be part of the fluid project wiki.. that alternative would be to create a new space, but it would be harder to find that way
2020-05-28T16:26:03  <Justin_o> michelled: what is this page used for https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Archive
2020-05-28T16:26:32  <colinclark> that seems like it could be a very appropriate place :)
2020-05-28T16:26:59  *** philip <philip!~philip@142.118.77.87> has joined #fluid-work
2020-05-28T16:27:07  <michelled> Justin_o: I used to keep links to things we'd reported on for Floe etc there
2020-05-28T16:27:12  <michelled> so I could easily find them
2020-05-28T16:27:24  <michelled> I still use it to find links to things we've made
2020-05-28T16:27:46  <Justin_o> michelled: we're looking for a place in the wiki to add the old blog posts
2020-05-28T16:28:15  <michelled> seems like a good place
2020-05-28T16:28:21  <michelled> you can reorganize it how ever you want
2020-05-28T16:28:26  <Justin_o> michelled: thanks
2020-05-28T16:28:34  <michelled> I don't really use keep it up to date anymore but I think I should
2020-05-28T16:28:38  <michelled> it really has been usful
2020-05-28T16:28:42  <michelled> if only I had more time ;)
2020-05-28T16:29:00  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: so you can add links to https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Archive and add child pages for each of the blog posts that you are migrating over
2020-05-28T16:29:30  *** philip <philip!~philip@142.118.77.87> has quit IRC (Read error: No route to host)

2020-05-28T16:29:42  <sachin10101998> Can I edit it just like that?
2020-05-28T16:29:56  <Justin_o> michelled: it's a good idea to have something to index everthing.. I'm often searching for things we did many years ago just for reference
2020-05-28T16:30:21  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: there should be an edit button at the top of the page, but make the child pages (migrate the blog posts) first
2020-05-28T16:30:41  <Justin_o> I think you should just be able to go the archive page and press "c" and it should open to creating a child pgae
2020-05-28T16:30:53  <sachin10101998> Yeah , the edit button is there. but Would things go live if any random account edits pages?
2020-05-28T16:35:05  <sachin10101998> And does it support markdown?
2020-05-28T16:35:23  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: well basically yes, but there are some things that can't be done bye some accounts. We get reports about changes so we moderate those.
2020-05-28T16:35:30  <Justin_o> and no it doesn't support markdown
2020-05-28T16:35:44  <Justin_o> it has it's own wiki syntax, but you can just use the wysiwyg editor
2020-05-28T16:35:55  <sachin10101998> Alright
2020-05-28T16:36:02  *** the-t-in-rtf <the-t-in-rtf!~textual@2a02:a210:9c0:2f80:d08f:1653:c87a:4893> has quit IRC (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2020-05-28T16:36:30  <Justin_o> you might be able to import some document types
2020-05-28T16:36:44  <sachin10101998> So I have to click on archive link above -> press c -> create blog posts -> go back to archive page and add links toe child pages that I created individually. right?
2020-05-28T16:37:38  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: yes, but when you go to create the link it will pop up a dialog that will let you choose a recently viewed page, so the link creation will be pretty easy
2020-05-28T16:38:15  <Justin_o> although that being said, it might be tricky as this is a completely new system for you.. maybe ping me after you get the first one done and I'll look it over.
2020-05-28T16:38:30  <sachin10101998> Ok thanks

2020-05-28T17:05:00  <dogeman> It's worth noticing that Infusion 1.0 was released 11 years ago on 26 May. That's day before yesterday. This post by colinclark https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/blob/master/src/documents/blog/2009-05-26-infusion-10-has-been-released.html.md states that
2020-05-28T17:05:11  <colinclark> wowza
2020-05-28T17:05:15  <colinclark> 11 years!
2020-05-28T17:05:29  <dogeman> yep
2020-05-28T17:09:16  <Justin_o> dogeman, colinclark: hard to believe it's been so long
2020-05-28T17:15:41  <dogeman> Justin_o colinclark I have removed the blogs folder from the PR and added them to fluid wiki
2020-05-28T17:15:49  <dogeman> You can check them out here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Archive
2020-05-28T17:16:31  <dogeman> You'll find a section "Fluid Project Old Blog Posts" at the end of the page.
2020-05-28T17:18:02  <Justin_o> dogeman: thanks for adding those. Regarding the blog posts. I think it's good that you included the original author and date, but I don't think those should be headings.
2020-05-28T17:18:29  <dogeman> I copied the titles from blog posts
2020-05-28T17:19:39  <Justin_o> maybe you could add an "info" box using the "info" macro (click on the "+" symbol in the toolbar) and add that information there instead.
2020-05-28T17:20:04  <dogeman> Which information to be precise?
2020-05-28T17:20:08  <Justin_o> that is, add the original author and publication date into the info box instead of being a heading
2020-05-28T17:20:24  <dogeman> Alright
2020-05-28T17:21:28  <Justin_o> thanks.. any chance you could also track down the broken links, and if you can't find what the new one should be, maybe compile a list of them and what blog post they came from and send it to the fluid-work list for others to look for
2020-05-28T17:21:57  <dogeman> Sure, will do. You do refer to the links which are mentioned in the news articles, right?
2020-05-28T17:23:14  <Justin_o> dogeman: I mean in the blog posts you just added to the wiki
2020-05-28T17:23:29  <dogeman> Yeah like the clown.atrc link?
2020-05-28T17:23:30  <Justin_o> but I guess that's also true for the news articles that are going up on the site too
2020-05-28T17:24:31  <dogeman> Btw, which macro do I need to add out of these in order to add author info and date?

2020-05-28T18:43:19  <clown> Okay, Justin_o I will see what I get by downloading the source from the Way Back Machine.   If it is off, this might take a while.  I'll let you know when it's done.
2020-05-28T18:44:32  <Justin_o> dogeman: thanks for doing that, could you send the google doc to the fluid-work list, some of these might be hard to find, but hopefully there will be people that know where the resources have been moved to
2020-05-28T18:44:47  <Justin_o> clown: thanks
2020-05-28T18:44:55  <dogeman> fluid work Mailing list, right?
2020-05-28T18:45:46  <Justin_o> dogeman: yes, that one
2020-05-28T18:46:27  <dogeman> sure
2020-05-28T18:52:10  <dogeman> Justin_o Is yash working on infusion docs migration?
2020-05-28T18:57:25  <Justin_o> dogeman: yes, he's looking into that

2020-05-28T21:54:43  <gmoss> I'm just catching up on today's discussions, very interesting stuff :) clown's old blog post about accessible drag-and-drop is relevant again with our eventual work on the freshly-filed SJRK-359 (https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-359).
2020-05-28T21:54:43  <gmoss> dogeman: awesome work compiling the broken links and migrating the blog posts to the wiki! I'll be taking a look at your PR shortly and will leave any feedback there

2020-05-28T23:08:00  <dogeman> gmoss thanks.
2020-05-28T23:12:57  <dogeman> We also need to discuss what should I do next. Migration has already been completed. I have github actions workflow  too ready to push. We need to discuss if we'll be going to use netlify-cms or not. If not, thn the project s almost finished and we need to explore more what we can do in coming months.
2020-05-28T23:14:46  <dogeman> We can also look into staticman for pushing content to github repo using forms
2020-05-28T23:15:18  <dogeman> or maybe we can look into integration of new features like comments, search , rss feed in FLOE and Fluid
2020-05-28T23:15:57  <dogeman> I'm presently looking into ways to integrate testing, html validation, linting with Github actions itself as suggested in issues of we count repo
