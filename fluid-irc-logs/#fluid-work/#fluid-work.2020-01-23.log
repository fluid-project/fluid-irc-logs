2020-01-23T15:27:43  <cindyli> is this a known issue, or did I do something wrong?
2020-01-23T15:28:04  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, thanks for the heads up.. I'm currently working on GPII-4269 and was thinking about removing the CRX stuff because we don't really use it anymore anyways
2020-01-23T15:28:38  <cindyli> ok
2020-01-23T15:30:01  <Justin_o> cindyli: I'm not really sure why you'd get that error though. it's not something I've noticed.
2020-01-23T15:30:51  <Justin_o> maybe something got missed or didn't work during the NPM install?
2020-01-23T15:31:05  <cindyli> interesting. trying again...

2020-01-23T15:42:12  <cindyli> re-ran npm install, same error. actually last time i also rebuilt npm dependencies. not sure where "mkdir" comes from. the only "mkdir" in our repo is from "Vagrantfile" that has nothing to do with the grunt build. i suspect it's crx that's performing its own task
2020-01-23T15:44:15  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, but you aren't calling the crx grunt task all?
2020-01-23T15:44:57  <cindyli> Justin_o: not at all
2020-01-23T15:45:13  <cindyli> i was running "grunt build" and "grunt buildDev"
2020-01-23T15:45:24  <Justin_o> those shouldn't be calling the CRX task

2020-01-23T16:26:19  <javjarfer[m]> also, it was interesting for me to see that "com.freedomscientific.magic" was selected when the preference set only targeted "com.freedomscientific.jaws" solution
2020-01-23T16:34:50  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i sort of agree with you that when the requested app is set to "com.freedomscientific.jaws", other applications probably should not be selected. But from the other hand, i noticed matchMaker converts app-specific prefs into common terms and tries to finds matches for those common terms in other installed applications, which seems reasonable too. we should talk to Bosmon about what's the appropriate way to handle this ca

2020-01-23T16:36:36  <Bosmon> cindyli - I thought we stopped the matchmaker doing this years ago
2020-01-23T16:37:11  <cindyli> Bosmon: doing what? converting app specific terms to common terms?
