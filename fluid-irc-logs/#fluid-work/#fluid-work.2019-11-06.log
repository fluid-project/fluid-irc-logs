2019-11-06T11:55:48  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], @Bosmon, @stegru, Sandra isn't available today and left it to us to decide whether we need a Windows onboarding meeting.
2019-11-06T11:55:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Just seeing if we need to meet.
2019-11-06T11:57:18  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I think we should have a chat
2019-11-06T11:57:25  <Bosmon> It's been a while, and would be interesting to see what javjarfer[m] is up to
2019-11-06T11:58:17  <the-t-in-rtf> No worries, I'll open Room 3 at the appointed hour.
2019-11-06T12:04:04  <stegru> i can't wait
2019-11-06T12:07:34  <javjarfer[m]> stegru the-t-in-rtf Bosmon ok, great, see you soon

2019-11-06T19:53:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have a PR for one of the Prefs Framework refactoring tasks that we talked about. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/967
2019-11-06T19:54:35  <Justin_o> I found that in order to make use of the split apart starter schema, we'd need to refactor UIO and really, the fluid.prefs.create mechanism. I'm sure we'll have more work to do on all of these as we progress, but this seemed like a good start.

2019-11-06T20:40:30  <Bosmon> I'm terrified it's going to conflict horribly with the potentia branch....
