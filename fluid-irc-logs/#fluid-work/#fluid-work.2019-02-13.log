2019-02-13T11:33:38  <jhernandez> got it
2019-02-13T11:35:51  <jhernandez> no, I don't think there's much progress since I didn't trigger any action in the onboarding team than having a talk with JJ about it
2019-02-13T11:36:02  <jhernandez> in any case
2019-02-13T11:37:35  <jhernandez> Danail_Dido: which settings specifically do you need to be adjusted? the ones that you mention in your email?
2019-02-13T11:45:52  <Danail_Dido> jhernandez - Yup, basically even using your PR's as a base none of the mouse settings worked, for some of them I don't even know what to use as a settings.
2019-02-13T11:46:15  <jhernandez> ok
2019-02-13T11:47:12  * jhernandez looking for the UX designs for the mouse stuff

2019-02-13T17:12:57  <sgithens> and about hardware compatibility
2019-02-13T17:13:15  <sgithens> I'm thinking about putting electrical tape around the edge of my trackpad to make it smaller
2019-02-13T17:13:38  <sgithens> I've found one github project that does this in software, but it requires nutty kernel stuff to install
2019-02-13T17:15:07  <colinclark> SMALLER?

2019-02-13T17:17:08  <sgithens> I turned off all the extra stuff, gestures, and tried it for a month, and I'm still afraid to type becauase I hit it all the time

2019-02-13T18:58:53  <jhernandez> in fact, these days we're working on a waltz at the guitar classes
2019-02-13T18:59:23  <jhernandez> I have some recordings, but for practicing, I can
2019-02-13T18:59:40  <jhernandez> I can't still play it at the right BPM
2019-02-13T18:59:49  <sgithens> :)
2019-02-13T19:00:12  <sgithens> are you teaching the guitar class or taking it?
2019-02-13T19:00:20  <jhernandez> taking
2019-02-13T19:00:33  <sgithens> you're like a professional musician already right?
2019-02-13T19:00:37  <jhernandez> haha
2019-02-13T19:00:46  <jhernandez> no
2019-02-13T19:01:22  <sgithens> jazz is pretty technically advanced
2019-02-13T19:01:50  <jhernandez> but for some period I was paid for that - I used to play in a band in spain for marriages, parties and all those kind of events
2019-02-13T19:02:36  <sgithens> I remember you had to go play some gigs after the last face to face
2019-02-13T19:03:13  <jhernandez> yeah, in classes we're learning gypsy jazz, which in fact is jazz, but the way they harmonize things is quite particular from the gypsy jazz
2019-02-13T19:03:57  <sgithens> that sounds vastly more complicated than the folk music waltz'es I play :)
2019-02-13T19:04:03  <jhernandez> oh yeah, that was with the soul/funk cover band I play with in brussels
