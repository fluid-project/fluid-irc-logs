2020-04-10T12:23:44  <stegru> hola jhernandez
2020-04-10T12:23:44  <jhernandez> given that Bosmon's not around
2020-04-10T12:23:48  <jhernandez> quick question
2020-04-10T12:24:46  <jhernandez> do we have a JIRA for the acceptance tests failures we're having these days?
2020-04-10T12:24:57  <stegru> I think so..
2020-04-10T12:24:57  <jhernandez> i.e.: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/311#issuecomment-611469403
2020-04-10T12:25:02  <jhernandez> ok ok
2020-04-10T12:25:14  <jhernandez> which one is it?
2020-04-10T12:26:53  <stegru> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4239
2020-04-10T12:27:02  <stegru> that covers manu failures
2020-04-10T12:27:56  <stegru> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3388
2020-04-10T12:28:17  <stegru> that's for the stickykeys one, i think

2020-04-10T14:37:33  <stegru> yes
2020-04-10T14:37:39  <kasparnet> I probably github spammed you with assignment in pull requests
2020-04-10T14:38:00  <stegru> yes, it did
2020-04-10T14:38:05  <stegru> thanks
2020-04-10T14:38:21  <kasparnet> haha yw
2020-04-10T14:38:29  <kasparnet> but I *think* I just assigned the ones that had work pending, or wasn't passing CI
2020-04-10T14:39:07  <stegru> yeh, i think so too - each one gave me a bad feeling
2020-04-10T14:39:18  <kasparnet> anyway, if I got any of them wrong, or when you finish those I got right and they're ready for review, just assign the reviewer to them and remove yourself from the assigned list
2020-04-10T14:39:30  <kasparnet> then I'll know who to harass
2020-04-10T14:39:40  <stegru> yes, no problem

2020-04-10T14:40:58  <kasparnet> if it's any consolation, I spammed bosmon3 and jhernandez a bit as well, I think
2020-04-10T14:42:05  <stegru> i hope you did
2020-04-10T14:56:29  <kasparnet> hey there the-t-in-rtf
2020-04-10T14:56:34  <kasparnet> are you still working
2020-04-10T14:56:37  <kasparnet> or are you eastering?
2020-04-10T14:56:49  <kasparnet> Hmm.... is everyone actually eastering?
2020-04-10T14:57:15  <kasparnet> "eastering is not a thing" ... yeah yeah, I know, but you know what I mean
2020-04-10T14:59:52  <the-t-in-rtf> it's 17:00, so easter or no I am feeding my family shortly
2020-04-10T15:00:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I am strongly considering taking the day off on Monday
2020-04-10T15:00:23  <the-t-in-rtf> but make your pitch, what's up?  Maybe you can motivate me to sneak in a few hours to help.
2020-04-10T15:03:39  <kasparnet> I wanted to ask for your super jedi JIRA skills.. but I actually think I found out
2020-04-10T15:03:57  <kasparnet> I wanted permission to change status of a JIRA to "In Progress" even if I wasn't owner
2020-04-10T15:04:11  <kasparnet> and have managed to allow admins to do so (along with the owner of the JIRA)
2020-04-10T15:04:14  <kasparnet> so I'm happy
2020-04-10T15:04:25  <kasparnet> thanks though, the-t-in-rtf
2020-04-10T15:04:30  <kasparnet> and happy easter :)
2020-04-10T15:15:40  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
2020-04-10T15:15:44  <the-t-in-rtf> JIRA questions are easy
2020-04-10T15:15:57  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'm glad to transition to a cocktail and spatula at this point
