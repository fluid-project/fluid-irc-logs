2019-03-05T09:41:32  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone with enough history.  I know we don't use any platforms but win32.json in practise, but I'd like to drag along as much of the cross-platform stuff as I can in my work on the SR.
2019-03-05T09:41:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I see that we have the same keys in use across multiple platforms.
2019-03-05T09:41:55  <the-t-in-rtf> (example to come shortly)
2019-03-05T09:43:59  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/linux.json5#L1295
2019-03-05T09:44:04  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L9619
2019-03-05T09:44:31  <the-t-in-rtf> So, long term I will work to remove the redundancy there.
2019-03-05T09:44:43  <the-t-in-rtf> My question is a bit different.
2019-03-05T09:45:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I am assuming that whatever the schemas are across all files, any test settings payload in testData/preferences should match ALL of the schemas for that setting
2019-03-05T09:45:30  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. that it should be valid data for all  platforms
2019-03-05T09:46:23  <the-t-in-rtf> Right now we would only be catching cruft from older work, but if we put those checks in place before we expand to other platforms, it will protect us in creating portable settings.
2019-03-05T09:46:27  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2019-03-05T10:13:14  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I'm just gonna keep commenting here, apparently we no longer support telegu, which is used in one of our test preferences.  I'm going to remove it, as that's the only setting under test in that file:
2019-03-05T10:13:14  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/telugu.json5
2019-03-05T10:23:51  <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, neat, I found a bug in AJV in testing with our data.
2019-03-05T10:24:01  <the-t-in-rtf> multiples of 0.1 don't work, researching now.
2019-03-05T10:26:30  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv#advanced-options
2019-03-05T10:26:41  <the-t-in-rtf> apparently it only works for integers unless you configure it
2019-03-05T10:27:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll need to update gpii-json-schema to support some sane precision by default.
2019-03-05T10:27:25  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone else, do we have any settings that need to be expressed using less than a tenth?
2019-03-05T10:27:40  <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps a hundredth?
2019-03-05T10:28:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I can make it fairly deep and see what the performance impact is.
2019-03-05T10:29:07  <the-t-in-rtf> this is the kind of thing that's really awesome to find out with test data and less awesome to find out with real data, glad I'm validating our old payloads even if we choose to throw lots of them out.

2019-03-05T12:50:40  <jhernandez> funny one
2019-03-05T12:52:23  <Bosmon> jhernandez - terrible
2019-03-05T12:52:28  <Bosmon> I guess stegru has seen this one before
2019-03-05T12:52:30  * jhernandez nods
2019-03-05T12:52:32  <Bosmon> I think it is something to do with asynchrony
2019-03-05T12:52:53  <jhernandez> yes, applying a similar fix to what we did on gpii-app did the problem to go away
2019-03-05T12:53:04  <Bosmon> But I wonder why this is USB drive specific
2019-03-05T12:53:50  <jhernandez> I'm not sure why, since gpii-app is triggering keyouts via function calls to the lifecycleManager
2019-03-05T12:54:32  <jhernandez> but in this case, the keyout is being triggered from gpii.userListeners
2019-03-05T12:54:45  <Bosmon> Perhaps this has happened directly because of that - given when we used to use HTTP endpoints the notification would be asynchronous
2019-03-05T12:55:00  <Bosmon> Perhaps it is objecting that some existing Windows API call is on its stack
2019-03-05T12:55:06  <Bosmon> Although that doesn't quite make a lot of sense
2019-03-05T12:55:40  <stegru> yes, this is the same error that we got with the reset desktop icon
2019-03-05T12:57:00  <stegru> and yes, I suspect it's to do with the current stack - considering the usb key-out is invoked as a result of some windows api callback
2019-03-05T12:57:07  <jhernandez> stegru: right, I wrapped https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/listeners.js#L169 into a setTimeout(f, 0) function and the problem goes away
2019-03-05T12:59:45  <stegru> I remember being suspicious of the process reporter - but a quick look didn't uncover anything
2019-03-05T13:01:33  <stegru> ah yes, the stack dump confirms this
2019-03-05T13:19:29  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/explodeLaunchHandlerStart.json5#L8
2019-03-05T13:19:45  <the-t-in-rtf> That no longer corresponds to an allowed value, currently only "get" and "set" are allowed.
2019-03-05T13:19:56  <the-t-in-rtf> just seeing if there are other "explodeOn" values that are meaningful.
