2020-10-16T13:33:55  <gtirloni> This was announced yesterday and it looks really interesting as a micro-PaaS solution... I think we'd benefit from using it in the future. However, I've tried a few examples and it's a bit buggy for now.. version 0.1.1, we can't ask much but I'll be keeping an eye on this as a way to simplify our development workflow: https://www.waypointproject.io
2020-10-16T14:03:56  <cindyli> philip: i issued this pull request - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/pull/6 - to renamed the ODS datasets. can you take a look. we know the most recent dataset was published on Aug 20. I suspect the attached date for "ODS/https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/blob/master/ODS/assessment_centre_locations_2020_08_06.csv" should be changed too but i cannot find its published date. do yo
2020-10-16T14:03:56  <cindyli> u have a trace of the published date?
2020-10-16T14:04:50  <philip> cindyli: I will take a look, and see if I can figure out the date for the older version
2020-10-16T14:05:33  <cindyli> thanks, philip
2020-10-16T14:48:31  <cindyli> philip: thanks for figuring out the publication date. it has been applied. can you review my pull request when you have a chance - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/pull/6. thanks
2020-10-16T14:48:47  <philip> cindyli: Yep, in progress
2020-10-16T14:50:35  <cindyli> cool. thanks

2020-10-16T16:51:51  <cindyli> gtirloni, colinclark: David sends a request for adding Facebook Pixel tracking code to the WeCount website. my research shows facebook pixel is a marketing tool that measures website visitors' actions, calculates who else might be interested in the WeCount project, then advertise the site to them. this reminds how Google analytics are replaced by Mamoto server that gtirloni set up in order to protect visitors' data. So i wonder: 1. a
2020-10-16T16:51:51  <cindyli> re there concerns too add Facebook Pixel tracking code? 2. does IDRC have a generic account for facebook business manager and event manager?
2020-10-16T17:04:25  <gtirloni> cindyli: I fully agree... adopting Matomo was done exactly due to that reason and adding Facebook Pixel seems like a step in the wrong direction
2020-10-16T17:05:41  <cindyli> ok
2020-10-16T17:08:04  <cindyli> gtirloni: it sounds like we don't have an IDRC account for facebook business manager, right?
2020-10-16T17:08:24  <cindyli> i rmb we used to have an IDRC account for google analytics
2020-10-16T17:10:22  <gtirloni> cindyli: I think the fluid.project.team@ account might have some website under it, but I'm not sure about other accounts...
2020-10-16T17:11:24  <cindyli> ok. thanks, gtirloni
2020-10-16T18:11:21  <colinclark> I’m really not sure that we should be uncritically adding Facebook trackers to the We Count website, cindyli
2020-10-16T18:11:52  <colinclark> These are exactly the approaches to personal data gathering that are at stake with the project
2020-10-16T18:12:12  <colinclark> I’m not averse to it, but I feel like somehow we should be reflective of these issues
2020-10-16T18:12:41  <colinclark> this may just be reality of any kind of social media marketing at this point
2020-10-16T18:12:53  <colinclark> and of course we want people to know about our project
2020-10-16T18:15:41  <cindyli> i agree
2020-10-16T18:17:09  <colinclark> Maybe have a conversation with David and ask if he thinks personal data tracking might be an issue for We Count?
2020-10-16T18:17:13  <cindyli> i've explained the situation to David. he agreed and decided not to add the facebook tracking. WeCount site will only have Mamoto tracking at least for now, colinclark, gtirloni
2020-10-16T18:17:17  <colinclark> ah ok
2020-10-16T18:17:19  <colinclark> great
2020-10-16T18:17:23  <colinclark> you’re miles ahead of me!
2020-10-16T18:17:41  <colinclark> nice work, cindyli
2020-10-16T18:17:57  <cindyli> nah, it's great to hear opinions of all you!
2020-10-16T20:25:05  <cindyli> philip: your update script used to have a function to run git actions - https://github.com/ptcher/data-update-github/blob/main/auto-update.js#L66. which library did you use for this "Git"?
2020-10-16T20:27:28  <philip> cindyli: I used nodegit https://www.nodegit.org/ https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodegit
2020-10-16T20:27:55  <philip> cindyli: Sorry, should have commented out the dependency instead of removing it
2020-10-16T20:28:24  <cindyli> not a problem. thanks. having a look...
2020-10-16T20:28:50  <philip> cindyli: Here's the folder of more detailed examples I mentioned in our meeting yesterday: https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/tree/master/examples
2020-10-16T20:30:27  <cindyli> cool. thanks, philip
2020-10-16T20:32:03  <cindyli> philip: it seems this library doesn't provide an operation for issuing pull requests
2020-10-16T20:32:48  <cindyli> "isomorphic-git" library that Bosmon found has the same issue
2020-10-16T20:33:53  <cindyli> the only library i found so far that can issue pull requests is https://www.npmjs.com/package/octokat
2020-10-16T20:34:56  <philip> cindyli: Yes, I was looking at that too, and I realize even the code I had in there to "create a pull request" actually doesn't finish the job, it still requires someone to interact with a browser as the final step
2020-10-16T20:36:03  <cindyli> for authorization probably
2020-10-16T20:36:21  <cindyli> philip: did you looked into or tried https://www.npmjs.com/package/octokat
2020-10-16T20:36:55  <cindyli> or do you mean this is the one you tried but requires an interaction?
2020-10-16T20:37:17  <philip> cindyli: I had octokat as a dependency, but didn't get far enough to have to figure out how to use it
2020-10-16T20:37:42  <philip> cindyli: the part that requires interaction is what was at the bottom of the doUpdate.sh script
2020-10-16T20:38:30  <cindyli> i see
2020-10-16T20:38:59  <philip> cindyli: which generates the URL that compares the relevant branches, which has the "create a PR" button on Github
2020-10-16T20:46:09  <cindyli> philip: does the last step "open https://github.com/$repo/pull/new/$branchName" opens the "create a pull request" webpage?
2020-10-16T20:47:08  <philip> cindyli: that is the intent, yeah, but it doesn't make sense outside of a manual use context
2020-10-16T20:48:38  <cindyli> great to know. thanks, philip
2020-10-16T22:09:17  <sgithens> The idea of having a pull request is something sort of specific to github or a similar site right? It doesn't really exist in vanilla git by itself? I mean you can add remotes and pull branches and merge them, but the idea of a "request to do so" is an added feature from social platforms like github?
2020-10-16T22:10:14  <Bosmon> sgithens - yes
2020-10-16T22:10:23  <Bosmon> I mean, git is just a DVCS, right ...
2020-10-16T22:10:25  <Bosmon> All it has is branches
2020-10-16T22:11:18  <sgithens> yeah, I was just asking because it'd make sense that something like nodegit wouldn't have that sort of feature
2020-10-16T22:32:34  <sgithens> reading this link of a link of a link from something on hacker news made me appreciate the algorithms spreadsheet reconciliation algorithms we've been talking about on the wecount chats  http://www.eusprig.org/horror-stories.htm
