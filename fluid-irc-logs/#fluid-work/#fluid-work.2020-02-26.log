2020-02-26T08:34:10  <the-t-in-rtf> @SemicolonExp, very nice writeup.
2020-02-26T08:34:31  <the-t-in-rtf> For anyone else who'd like to read it: https://medium.com/@semicolonexpected/30-minute-keyboard-challenge-9cc09ee7d874
2020-02-26T08:35:20  <the-t-in-rtf> As for next steps, the other mentors and I are meeting today to discuss, but in general, it's time to familiarise yourself with the community, its practices, and Infusion.
2020-02-26T08:43:20  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @kasparnet
2020-02-26T08:43:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Just wanted to mention that Sandra would previously call off the regular APCP meeting unless there were topics to discuss.
2020-02-26T08:44:07  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez, stegru , Bosmon , the-t-in-rtf yesterday I researched the problems that I was seeing in CI regarding the Windows version of my pulls, they looked unrelated and weird. So after I determined that couldn't be related to the pull itself I tried to test current master stability, and current master stability for Windows is fine against the fixed version we have for universal, **but ** is currently broken
2020-02-26T08:44:07  <javjarfer[m]> against the master version of universal
2020-02-26T08:44:30  <javjarfer[m]> This is the pull request of the new issue for researching the problem https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/299
2020-02-26T08:44:31  <the-t-in-rtf> it's still on the agenda for today
2020-02-26T08:44:45  <the-t-in-rtf> if it's happening I assume you're running it?
2020-02-26T08:46:24  <javjarfer[m]> Looks like the new changes introduced to universal recently have created inconsistencies with the acceptanceTests, for this reason, every time I make a pull to universal that changes the SR or other relevant parts, I try to make an empty pull for Windows, pointing to the new version of universal, to increase the certainty of not breaking anything on the other side
2020-02-26T08:47:54  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], it's a fair point, I'm looking at the test failures now.
2020-02-26T08:49:28  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: great, thanks! I will be onboarding the final settings for JAWS as sgithens seems to have interest into them, and the AT testing build
2020-02-26T08:50:19  <the-t-in-rtf> Did you get your colour vision pull working?
2020-02-26T08:50:56  <kasparnet> morning @the-t-in-rtf
2020-02-26T08:51:20  <kasparnet> thanks for the heads up
2020-02-26T08:51:36  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: universal side of the pull is working, and acceptance tests regarding the features introduced there too, but I haven't updated the Windows side of the pull since it's going to fail anyway with this issues
2020-02-26T08:51:43  <kasparnet> i dont really have a sense yet of whether there are topics to discuss
2020-02-26T08:51:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume Gregg or someone can change the ownership of the events she created?
2020-02-26T08:52:05  <the-t-in-rtf> Usually one of us would get in touch with her if we had something, and she'd call it off if she didn't hear from anyone.
2020-02-26T08:52:28  <the-t-in-rtf> Maybe we can have a short meeting then to confirm how we want to work things post-Sandara.
2020-02-26T08:53:43  <kasparnet> yeah, that's a good idea
2020-02-26T08:53:47  <the-t-in-rtf> Just to fill in some gaps, that meeting tends to be stuff that's more squarely focused on the APCP, like the devops pipeline and how developers can use that.
2020-02-26T08:54:03  <kasparnet> ok
2020-02-26T08:54:07  <the-t-in-rtf> we often cancelled it because there was so much overlap with the later GPII meeting
2020-02-26T08:54:17  <kasparnet> yeah, I could imagine
2020-02-26T08:54:24  <kasparnet> and who usually attends the apcp meeting?
2020-02-26T08:54:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Sandra would also make the go/no go call on the Windows onboarding meeting every other Wednesday
2020-02-26T08:55:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I invited you to tonight's so you can see the attendee list.
2020-02-26T08:55:33  <the-t-in-rtf> usually it's RtF devs and devops.
2020-02-26T08:56:05  <the-t-in-rtf> with the usual smattering of IDRC folks
2020-02-26T08:56:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I invited you to the next Windows onboarding meeting so you can see that
2020-02-26T08:56:55  <the-t-in-rtf> you have longer to avoid that iceberg, the next one is next week
2020-02-26T08:57:05  <the-t-in-rtf> but at least you can see that one coming from further out
2020-02-26T08:58:03  *** Aarsh <Aarsh!a995c596@169.149.197.150> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-26T08:58:19  <the-t-in-rtf> One last thing for now, Sandra would also have cancelled our meetings that conflict with the face-to-face, so really nearly everything next week needs to go.
2020-02-26T08:58:52  <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry to pile on, @kasparnet, but I figured you'd want to know.

2020-02-26T09:04:15  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], I'm creating a JIRA ticket and will work on universal and windows in combination to fix things.
2020-02-26T09:04:24  <the-t-in-rtf> Lots and lots of expected values are just wildly off.
2020-02-26T09:05:00  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf:  I already created a JIRA ticket for it yesterday https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4382
2020-02-26T09:05:06  <the-t-in-rtf> like many are missing (end up undefined)
2020-02-26T09:05:14  <the-t-in-rtf> great, I'll assign that to myself
2020-02-26T09:05:49  <kasparnet> thanks the-t-in-rtf, that's really helpful
2020-02-26T09:06:48  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: the undefined and wild values is something that happens a lot in the acceptance tests, because the operation doesn't complete when something fails, so, the only important part of the "expected" vs "actual" diff, is the first thing that have failed, usually I look for the solution in alphabetical order and I check which is the one that present the first failure
2020-02-26T09:07:09  <the-t-in-rtf> good to know
2020-02-26T09:07:32  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully it's something as simple as the initial expected values, I already have those up side-by-side
2020-02-26T09:08:09  <the-t-in-rtf> like DoubleClickTimeConfig and DoubleClickWidthConfig are the first ones that are off
2020-02-26T09:08:22  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, not time
2020-02-26T09:08:22  *** ikehakinyemi <ikehakinyemi!c5d33dbb@197.211.61.187> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-26T09:08:27  <the-t-in-rtf> DoubleClickHeightConfig
2020-02-26T09:09:05  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: but those are the first values that are off in the "expected" vs "actual" comparison, the order of application is not the order in which the values are presented in that diff
2020-02-26T09:09:32  <the-t-in-rtf> go on
2020-02-26T09:09:54  <the-t-in-rtf> it's definitely in alphabetical order?
2020-02-26T09:10:19  <javjarfer[m]> what I usually do, is check the payload, for example, "os_win" an see which are the payload solutions that are applied in alphabetical order, and check for the first failure
2020-02-26T09:10:35  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: I can't guarantee that
2020-02-26T09:11:07  <the-t-in-rtf> the os_win one is a good tip
2020-02-26T09:11:17  <javjarfer[m]> from my previous experiences that procedure is the one that worked me most efficiently for finding the issue
2020-02-26T09:12:30  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: sorry, now I can't remember is it's alphabetical or orden of appearance in the SR, it may be the second
2020-02-26T09:12:30  *** Aarsh <Aarsh!a995c596@169.149.197.150> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2020-02-26T09:13:12  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, no.
2020-02-26T09:13:23  <javjarfer[m]> I can also tell you that yesterday I isolated failures regarding this specific payload for os_win
2020-02-26T09:13:25  <the-t-in-rtf> we really need finer grained tests than mega payloads then.
2020-02-26T09:13:43  <the-t-in-rtf> but anyway, when you isolated them, what did you learn?
2020-02-26T09:13:53  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: searching for it
2020-02-26T09:13:57  <javjarfer[m]> one sec
2020-02-26T09:13:58  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
2020-02-26T09:45:02  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, JJ and I are starting work on downstream acceptance test failures in the windows repo following the merge of my latest transform/schema fixes.
2020-02-26T09:45:18  <the-t-in-rtf> it would help to get a dev release with those if you have a moment.
2020-02-26T09:46:21  <the-t-in-rtf> aaah
2020-02-26T09:46:49  <the-t-in-rtf> The latest is correct, the dates are just off because you did it right on the cusp of midnight
2020-02-26T09:47:37  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the dev release from the 24th is associated with this commit (that on GitHub I see as having happened on the 25th).
2020-02-26T09:47:45  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/359e5b5514da055b0650da98873a3c5f009c7045
2020-02-26T09:48:05  <the-t-in-rtf> Having the short commit hash in the dev release is pretty useful in cases like this.

2020-02-26T10:03:11  <the-t-in-rtf> is it your client truncating that, or the IRC server?

2020-02-26T10:05:23  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'm confused by the last link, the test output
2020-02-26T10:05:38  <the-t-in-rtf> are those the original failures, or failures that also happen with the commented out material?

2020-02-26T10:06:21  <javjarfer[m]> those are failures that happens with the commented out material
2020-02-26T10:06:33  <javjarfer[m]> I was trying to isolate the source of failure
2020-02-26T10:07:25  <the-t-in-rtf> were you also adjusting the expected output in the tests?
2020-02-26T10:08:06  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. commenting out the expected values for the commented out settings?
2020-02-26T10:09:02  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf , yes exactly
2020-02-26T10:10:03  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I can continue that effort
2020-02-26T10:10:15  <the-t-in-rtf> finally got the new vagrant image downloaded

2020-02-26T14:17:35  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], I added tests, it caught the two broken settings that caused the test failures

2020-02-26T14:17:48  <the-t-in-rtf> still worth writing the tests to confirm
2020-02-26T14:17:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll have a pull in shortly

2020-02-26T14:25:34  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon @javjarfer[m], here's the fix: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/852
2020-02-26T14:27:47  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - looks good - isn't this something that actually goes in the schema?
2020-02-26T14:28:05  <the-t-in-rtf> nope
2020-02-26T14:28:31  <the-t-in-rtf> these are options the settings handler needs to be able to operate
2020-02-26T14:28:41  <the-t-in-rtf> they do not describe what the user actually needs to pass
2020-02-26T14:29:19  <Bosmon> Shouldn't we have some schematic material for that, at least in your upcoming refactoring?
2020-02-26T14:29:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I absolutely agree and am already thinking about it
2020-02-26T14:29:56  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf, great! For this pull to be complete it needs a windows pull, pointing to this new universal version, to check in CI that all acceptance tests are passing
2020-02-26T14:29:56  <the-t-in-rtf> we will need to talk a few times and also give my brain time to churn

2020-02-26T14:39:45  <HarshSingh> gmoss jhung Hello !! I am Harsh Willing to work on the project "Migrate FLOE and Fluid project websites to Hugo Static Site Generator" under GSOC 2020. Will be glad to seek your further help and get started.
2020-02-26T14:39:50  <the-t-in-rtf> the tests already pass in windows with the same changes made manually
2020-02-26T14:39:55  <javjarfer[m]> "Scaling" setting isn't a setting at that the settingsHandler needs to be aware of, it's an endpoint for accessing both of the other settings, "TileWallpaper" and "WallpaperStyle", "Scaling" is never stored in the registry
2020-02-26T14:40:37  <the-t-in-rtf> so this is pretty terrible then
2020-02-26T14:40:46  <the-t-in-rtf> we have no way of telling blanks from live ammo
2020-02-26T14:41:00  <the-t-in-rtf> is it harmful in any way to leave it in?
2020-02-26T14:41:09  <the-t-in-rtf> (the entry for "Scaling")?
2020-02-26T14:41:46  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf:  I don't know, the setting and the transform will have the same "endpoint" I don't know if the transform takes preference, but that could be dangerous
2020-02-26T14:42:38  <the-t-in-rtf> The solution then is to make "Scaling" an intra-application transform.
2020-02-26T14:42:51  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if it's meant to be stored by the settings handler, it should be a supported setting
2020-02-26T14:43:05  <the-t-in-rtf> if it's not, it should be like any of the other SPI settings we infer via transforms
2020-02-26T14:43:56  <the-t-in-rtf> we will need a better concept for all of this, but it's not safe to have someone onboard a registry setting incorrectly and not know about it

2020-02-26T14:45:44  <colinclark> Hi HarshSingh, nice to meet you
2020-02-26T14:46:41  <colinclark> Have you read our wiki pages for information about the project and how to get started?

2020-02-26T14:48:22  <HarshSingh> colinclark Just wanted to know if this project is available and do i need to have a contribution history before applying for the same. I am a newbie and can do this project
2020-02-26T14:48:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, very good catch, @javjarfer[m], that's exactly the kind of thing I needed to think about for the LSR work.
2020-02-26T14:48:52  <HarshSingh> do i need to do anything else before applying for this
2020-02-26T14:49:09  <colinclark> HarshSingh: We’re still in the phase where we’re accepting proposals for the project, yes
2020-02-26T14:50:21  <colinclark> As for a contribution history, no, you don’t need to have contributed before
2020-02-26T14:50:45  <colinclark> but you’ll need to put together a proposal that explains your plan for how to accomplish the work and why you’re able to do so

2020-02-26T18:33:07  <sachin10101998> Created a ticket against infusion (https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6458) . Can I assign it to myself on my own or only some moderator or admin can do that
2020-02-26T18:34:49  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I don't think you can assign it yourself. I'll take a look.
2020-02-26T18:35:02  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: maybe just leave a comment for now
2020-02-26T18:38:11  <sachin10101998> alright
2020-02-26T18:39:08  <sachin10101998> Justin_o is there some particular protocol or coding style I need to follow to complete this task?
2020-02-26T18:39:33  <sachin10101998> Do I add my code to the same store.js file which you linked to earlier in a comment.
2020-02-26T18:39:45  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf Alright! Thanks
2020-02-26T18:40:07  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: you should read through https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

2020-02-26T18:53:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: using the "question" label makes sense, especially if it's already available. good find!
