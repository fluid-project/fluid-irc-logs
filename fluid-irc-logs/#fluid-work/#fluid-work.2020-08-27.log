2020-08-27T15:14:39  <philip> Teddy___, Uttara: are you joining the Fable onboarding meeting?
2020-08-27T15:15:11  <philip> I only just got the email about it, it's started and we're doing introductions
2020-08-27T15:16:14  <Teddy___> I signed up for the 2pm session
2020-08-27T15:19:00  <philip> Oh, right!
2020-08-27T15:19:52  <Uttara> philip: yes I am at 2 as well
2020-08-27T15:20:36  <philip> OK :)
2020-08-27T15:46:41  <gmoss> philip: I've opted to push the talk about commit messages to next week :D I thought it might be a more fruitful discussion with more people present haha.. there isn't anything planned for Tuesday the 1st, is there?
2020-08-27T15:53:09  <philip> Doesn't look like it gmoss, though I think we have yet to schedule the Care for the Future screening cherylhjli proposed
2020-08-27T15:53:57  <gmoss> philip: okay, well I can always take the 3rd :) just wait, we'll find another reason to push it back hahaha
2020-08-27T15:54:09  <philip> -___-
2020-08-27T15:54:43  <gmoss> :P
2020-08-27T16:31:20  <michelled> gmoss: did you want a storytelling checkin today? or did we cover it in standup?
2020-08-27T16:31:59  <gmoss> michelled: I'd be happy to! I'm just checking something out with Teddy___ at the moment, can we do a quick one at 12:45?
2020-08-27T16:32:07  <michelled> yup!
2020-08-27T16:47:48  <gmoss> michelled: I'm good to meet now :)

2020-08-27T17:19:32  <Uttara> Teddy__ : I am email you the updated svg files for the homepage tiles. Let me know once you receive them
2020-08-27T17:19:42  <Uttara> Teddy__ : *emailing
2020-08-27T17:56:35  <gmoss> Bosmon: if I had a set of components, each having their own boolean model value, and I wanted to create a model relay with transform that was effectively a logical OR on all of those boolean values, is there a built-in infusion transform that you would suggest using? If not, my plan would be to use a free transform calling a function which uses `array.some` on the collection of values
2020-08-27T20:53:20  <gtirloni> has anyone ever used OCAD's VPN? Lorna/Gloria might need it and I was wondering if anyone had experience with that
2020-08-27T20:59:13  <gmoss> I never used the old or new VPN, unfortunately. I found an email from Iris in 2018 asking for details on who might need access to it, and a little discussion about it from just before lockdown started, but that's all that's relevant in my inbox :( I'd suggest contacting Yong or Alea from IT
2020-08-27T21:22:58  <gtirloni> thanks gmoss :)
2020-08-27T21:23:48  <gmoss> Not really the answer you're looking for, I'm sure, but I'm glad to be of any help :) good luck!
