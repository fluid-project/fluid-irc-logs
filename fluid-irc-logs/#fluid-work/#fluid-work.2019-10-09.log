2019-10-09T15:43:00  <jhung> danielcho what browser are you using to test Voiceover?
2019-10-09T15:43:22  <danielcho> jhung: I am using it on Chrome
2019-10-09T15:43:34  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@135-23-85-27.cpe.pppoe.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-10-09T15:44:44  <jhung> Try Safari and see if the behaviour is as expected danielcho. Screen readers behave different in different browsers. Generally speaking, JAWS works well with Chrome, NVDA with Firefox, and Voiceover with Safari.
2019-10-09T15:45:43  <danielcho> oh I didn't know that, I will try it on Safari. Thanks for the info!

2019-10-09T15:47:42  <jhung> No problem. Getting good experience in all screen readers and browsers may be very difficult to attain. A lot of time can be spent experimenting with different code and implementation... it can be very challenging and time consuming.
2019-10-09T15:56:54  <danielcho> jhung: Yeah it sure does look like a challenging task, especially with no previous experience on testing accessibility; the issue I mentioned during the stand-up is resolved on Safari, thanks again!

2019-10-09T20:05:02  <Justin_o> @michelled: do you mean FLUID-6412? I’ll probably need to see if there is a way to test it without an android device. Is there a timeline for when it needs to be addressed? Also it would be worth testing my FLUID-6278 PR which does make changes to the highlighting. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/962
2019-10-09T20:05:51  <michelled> Justin_o: I don't have a specific timeframe but I think it would be a good thing to fix at some point
