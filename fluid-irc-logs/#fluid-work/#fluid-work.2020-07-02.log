2020-07-02T13:51:35  <gtirloni> Bosmon Justin_o sbates: I've pushed a PR for kettle to run on Linux, Windows and macOS as well. There was a minor issue on Windows which had me add a .gitattributes file that fixed the issue with eslint complaining about CRLF endings though. https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/62
2020-07-02T13:52:22  <Bosmon> gtirloni - thanks, although I think we had decided that eslint probably should complain about CRLF endings?
2020-07-02T13:52:59  <Bosmon> That is - there should be none in the repo
2020-07-02T13:58:53  <gtirloni> yep, it'll complain but on Windows if we let git do the autocrlf thingie, it'll convert the LF's to CRLF's automatically... it's just at checkout time. There's none of that when running on Linux or macOS.. so CRLF's will certainly get caught
2020-07-02T14:00:51  <gtirloni> hmm or won't they.. now i'm confused. let me read on gitattributes a bit more
2020-07-02T14:03:32  <Bosmon> gtirloni - I think, remembering early conversations with Justin_o and the like, that our community standard was not to let git do the autocrlf thing
2020-07-02T14:03:45  <Bosmon> And to insist that all files as they sit in repos have UNIX line endings
2020-07-02T14:04:12  <Bosmon> I believe this involves setting the git config flag of "core.autocrlf=input"
2020-07-02T14:04:18  <gtirloni> yeah, makes sense. I need to change the "* text eol=lf" to "* text=false" to disable autocrlf.. I'll modify that. That should ensure git inside GH Actions is not being smarter than we want it
2020-07-02T14:07:06  <gtirloni> (or anywhere else)
2020-07-02T14:09:26  <the-t-in_> @gmoss and others I've heard from about the use of gpii-X libraries, I have created a ticket to cover migrating some of the packages used within the Fluid community to the fluidproject organisation.
2020-07-02T14:09:27  <the-t-in_> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6524
2020-07-02T14:09:44  <the-t-in_> Please comment there if my list is missing things that are needed for the work you do.
2020-07-02T14:10:12  <the-t-in_> by gpii-X I mean helper libraries like gpii-binder, gpii-testem, and many others, a longer list is on the ticket.
2020-07-02T14:10:57  <gtirloni> Bosmon Justin_o sbates: I'm just pondering now if I should just run the git command that sets core.autocrlf=input inside CI and forget about .gitattributes.. it seems gitattributes will mess with people's configurations (e.g. I'm telling it to disable autocrlf entirely.. whilst someone might have it set to autocrlf=yeah! eol=lf and expect it to work
2020-07-02T14:11:53  <Bosmon> gtirloni - yes, I think that seems reasonable (to just run the command), if that is what .gitattributes does
2020-07-02T14:12:03  <gtirloni> ok
2020-07-02T14:17:18  <colinclark> gtirloni: yeah, I ran into this kind of thing recently myself
2020-07-02T14:17:33  <colinclark> Getting set up with a new project that used the Fluid eslint standards on Windows
2020-07-02T14:17:41  <colinclark> it seems we should document this better
2020-07-02T14:18:16  <colinclark> but our linting rules unequivocally require Windows users to set Git up to always use Unix line endings
2020-07-02T14:21:17  <colinclark> the-t-in_: It’ll be so great to carry these libraries forward as part of Fluid
2020-07-02T14:21:20  <colinclark> thanks for looking into othis
2020-07-02T14:21:54  <colinclark> Defniitely I use your linting tools, webdriver, and binder
2020-07-02T14:22:03  <colinclark> but your whole list seems reasonable to migrate
2020-07-02T14:23:24  <the-t-in_> Yeah, I was just checking all of their usage graphs on npm ton confirm
2020-07-02T14:23:27  <the-t-in_> to
2020-07-02T14:23:29  <sbates> gtirloni, Bosmon, Justin_o: there has been some discussion regarding making line ending conversion an option to the GitHub Actions checkout step: https://github.community/t/git-config-core-autocrlf-should-default-to-false/16140 and https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/135
2020-07-02T14:23:42  <the-t-in_> The ones I left off only lead to my projects
2020-07-02T14:23:55  *** the-t-in_ is now known as the-t-in-rtf
2020-07-02T14:25:16  <sbates> but at the moment I believe that we would need to either set .gitattributes in the repo, or config the CI git instance prior to checking out the code
2020-07-02T14:26:13  <gtirloni> sbates: I'm proposing we configure it in CI only to be less intrusive to other peoples' local configurations.. waiting on the PR to build now: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/62/checks?check_run_id=830982005
2020-07-02T14:26:50  <sbates> gtirloni: that seems like a reasonable solution to me
2020-07-02T15:40:25  <dogeman> colinclark if we remove the news sectrion completely from the fluid project, wer wouldn't be left with much.
2020-07-02T15:40:32  <dogeman> It would be just 4 html pages in total
2020-07-02T15:40:42  <dogeman> and that would beat the purpose of shifting to a static site generator
2020-07-02T15:46:10  <dogeman> Moreover, the boilerplate code for fluidic sites using 11ty is almost ready. Will show a demo of it on coming Monday.
2020-07-02T15:52:09  <Uttara> cindyli: Hi, we are still having the tech meeting right?
2020-07-02T15:52:47  <colinclark> dogeman: Well, let’s think about it for a second...
2020-07-02T15:53:11  <colinclark> Put yourself in the position of a visitor to the site, who wants to learn more about Fluid
2020-07-02T15:53:29  <colinclark> and what does a site filled with very very old news articles suggest to you?
2020-07-02T15:57:07  <cindyli> yes, Uttara. it'll likely be a quick update
2020-07-02T16:03:36  <dogeman> That's correct. But if we have just a few html pages, using an ssg would be overkill.
2020-07-02T16:04:01  <dogeman> colinclark
2020-07-02T16:05:39  <colinclark> I’m not sure what to say, dogeman
2020-07-02T16:06:01  <colinclark> You didn’t really answer my question—it was an actual question, not rhetorical
2020-07-02T16:06:27  <colinclark> and I just can’t see why it’s worth your time to port over news stories that are largely over a decade old
2020-07-02T16:06:35  <colinclark> just for quantity’s sake
2020-07-02T16:11:24  <dogeman> Yeah, that's totally fine. If the news articles aren't useful anymore( as one of them is a job posting from years ago) , there's no point in keeping them there. When I first looked at fluidproject.org when I was drafting my proposal , I didn't even look at the news articles because all the information I needed to know about fluid project was available on the homepage and about page itself.
2020-07-02T16:11:54  <dogeman> It makes sense to remove the articles which are not useful anymore.
2020-07-02T16:12:14  <dogeman> But there are a few articles like blog posts for older gsoc projects written there which can be continued.
2020-07-02T16:13:13  <dogeman> sorry, just checked that the gsoc blog posts are on floeproject news section and not on fluid
2020-07-02T16:13:27  <colinclark> ah right
2020-07-02T16:13:40  <colinclark> I mean, I’m flexible
2020-07-02T16:13:56  <colinclark> but I think a much simpler Fluid Project site isn’t a bad thing
2020-07-02T16:14:04  <colinclark> and the next step is that we’re going to rewrite the site
2020-07-02T16:14:27  <colinclark> possibly redesign it, but at very least, to rewrite the content and change the structure of it to better reflect what we’re doing these days
2020-07-02T16:14:49  <dogeman> Just check the news section again. There is no blog post which I find necessary or required in 2020. Most of the blogs are several years old and need not be present anymore on the website
2020-07-02T16:14:57  <colinclark> yeah
2020-07-02T16:15:05  <colinclark> I think that’s probably true, for better or worse
2020-07-02T16:15:17  <dogeman> That seems interesting. By rewriting do you mean design changes or content addition/updation?
2020-07-02T16:15:29  <colinclark> well, I’d love to redesign the site
2020-07-02T16:15:43  <colinclark> I’m not sure if we’ll have the resources or not, but hopefully jhung might have some cycles at some point
2020-07-02T16:15:53  <colinclark> But basically rewriting all the content
2020-07-02T16:16:01  <colinclark> and changing the information architecture
2020-07-02T16:16:32  <dogeman> 11ty provides a few starter template designs, but it makes more sense to chose one from hugo or jekyll who have a wider library  of templates and then convert it to something that 11ty can support too.
2020-07-02T16:16:33  <colinclark> I’d like it to better reflect us as a community of practice around inclusive co-design and user-continued design
2020-07-02T16:17:18  <dogeman> I talked to jhung about  this and he said that he has something in mind for new content for the site and has been working with few design guys too if I remember correctly.
2020-07-02T16:19:03  <gmoss> gtirloni: thanks for merging my 362 PR :)
2020-07-02T16:19:03  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for filing FLUID-6524! Everything used by the Storytelling Tool is included on your list, including gpii-handlebars (there's a question about whether that is used).
2020-07-02T16:21:40  <sbates> colinclark, dogeman: sorry to jump into the middle of your conversation. I was thinking about old news and one of the positive qualities they have is to give a sense of the history of the project and I think that can be valuable
2020-07-02T16:22:00  <colinclark> even when there’s nothing new? :)
2020-07-02T16:22:45  <colinclark> and would a kind of “highlghts” or “timelines” page capture some of this in a similar way:
2020-07-02T16:22:47  <colinclark> ?
2020-07-02T16:23:35  <sbates> the risk of having nothing new is that it looks like there's no current work and there is overhead in constantly adding news
2020-07-02T16:24:18  <colinclark> yeah
2020-07-02T16:24:20  <sbates> I think an alternate like a timelines page would definitely be an option
2020-07-02T16:24:31  <colinclark> the latter is always challenging—keeping a news site up to date
2020-07-02T16:24:37  <sbates> agreed
2020-07-02T16:24:51  <colinclark> Given the re-framing of the Fluid site, I think we could have lots of news stories to add on a regular basis
2020-07-02T16:25:12  <Justin_o> sbates, colinclark: something that I sometimes find confusing is to understand where some things should be. i.e IDRC site vs Fluid vs etc..
2020-07-02T16:25:16  <colinclark> documenting our co-design activities on various projects, things related to UIO and recent work on Infusion, etc.
2020-07-02T16:25:22  <colinclark> it’s just a question of keeping on it, which is a lot of work
2020-07-02T16:25:43  <Justin_o> the reframing might help with the confusion I mentioned above
2020-07-02T16:25:50  <colinclark> yes
2020-07-02T16:26:21  <colinclark> it will help a lot
2020-07-02T16:30:01  <colinclark> The short version is that I see Fluid as focusing on “open practices,” broadly speaking
2020-07-02T16:30:15  <colinclark> Fluid is a part of the IDRC’s work
2020-07-02T16:30:45  <colinclark> so there will naturally be overlap
2020-07-02T16:31:18  <colinclark> but often what we put on the Fluid site will be a) from a broader community perspective and b) more focused on certain technologies and design approaches
2020-07-02T16:31:27  <colinclark> the details :)
2020-07-02T16:43:00  <gmoss> gtirloni: it looks like the DB container may still having issues on the Storytelling Tool staging site: https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/stories
2020-07-02T16:43:54  <gtirloni> gmoss: thanks, I'll take a look. I think I'll change our monitoring from pinging / to /stories, what do you think?
2020-07-02T16:44:24  <dogeman> colinclark: So what should be the next step to update fluid website?
2020-07-02T16:44:51  <gmoss> gtirloni: sure, /stories is already the smoketest URL so that seems pretty reasonable to me. It's interesting that it worked just fine after build but isn't now
2020-07-02T16:45:49  <colinclark> dogeman: Why not start by choosing which news articles on the Fluid site are more ephemeral vs. historical (i.e. to sbates’ point)?
2020-07-02T16:46:05  <colinclark> remove the ones that aren’t really needed
2020-07-02T16:46:10  <gtirloni> gmoss: thanks, changed. i'll check the error now
2020-07-02T16:46:18  <gmoss> gtirloni: thank you!
2020-07-02T16:46:21  <colinclark> and keep the ones that reflect major milestones or achievements
2020-07-02T16:46:38  <colinclark> where you find broken links in the latter, link to the Wayback Machine
2020-07-02T16:46:59  <colinclark> or, if that’s not possible, remove the link
2020-07-02T16:47:06  <colinclark> Does that seem reasonable, dogeman?
2020-07-02T16:57:04  <gtirloni> gmoss: it's back. for some reason the docker volume that holds the couchdb data was gone O_o .. I've never seen this happen. I've restored it from backup now
2020-07-02T16:58:08  <gmoss> gtirloni: I wonder what's going on... is the volume persistent between builds?
2020-07-02T16:58:21  <gmoss> *is it meant to be
2020-07-02T16:58:22  <gtirloni> gmoss: yep
2020-07-02T16:58:26  <gmoss> strange
2020-07-02T16:58:28  <gtirloni> very
2020-07-02T16:59:27  <gmoss> gtirloni: the weirdest part to me is that it must have been there when the deploy happened yesterday: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/runs/826336771?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:13
2020-07-02T16:59:34  <gmoss> that line would have shown the error otherwise
2020-07-02T16:59:40  <gtirloni> yeah
2020-07-02T16:59:51  <gmoss> so it seems like something caused it to go down
2020-07-02T16:59:51  <gtirloni> I'll have a thorough look at this server
2020-07-02T17:00:22  <gmoss> gtirloni: much appreciated :) if there's anything you need from me, just let me know!
2020-07-02T17:00:27  <gtirloni> thanks!
2020-07-02T17:17:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: let me know if you need any help with the testing
2020-07-02T17:21:46  <gmoss> Justin_o: Much appreciated :) I was just poking around in the browser tests and updating the testing grid before I begin in earnest. If you'd like to do the tests for MacOS, that would save me a little bit of time. The other four environments might be trickier for you :P
2020-07-02T17:22:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: let me know if you have any questions about how the grid works
2020-07-02T17:27:55  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure, can you send me a link to the testing grid
2020-07-02T17:28:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Storytelling+Tool+Minimal+Testing+Grid
2020-07-02T17:28:31  <gmoss> we're just doing the minimal grid today, the full grid is going to be done less often since it takes days
2020-07-02T17:29:09  <Justin_o> I have a different version of macOS, is it okay if I just update the grid to reflect that
2020-07-02T17:29:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: ^
2020-07-02T17:30:45  <Justin_o> gmoss: and is this the site we're testing against https://staging-stories.floeproject.org
2020-07-02T17:31:22  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for clarifying about gpii-handlebars, @gmoss.
2020-07-02T17:31:37  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll plan to move it as well.
2020-07-02T17:32:18  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's fine, yes. and that is the correct URL
2020-07-02T17:32:18  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: excellent :)
2020-07-02T17:32:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: for test stories, I like to indicate what test number and what environment it is, so something like "mac test 6" or similar
2020-07-02T17:33:02  <gmoss> in the story title, that is
2020-07-02T17:34:11  <Justin_o> okay
2020-07-02T17:34:48  <gmoss> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/p4V78Hc9/
2020-07-02T17:34:55  <gmoss> whoops those were meant to be messages
2020-07-02T17:34:56  <gmoss> Justin_o:
2020-07-02T17:35:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: haha I was wondering what happened there
2020-07-02T17:35:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: I think I'm good for now, but will ping you if necessary
2020-07-02T17:37:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good :)
2020-07-02T17:42:18  <dogeman> colinclark yeah that makes sense.
2020-07-02T17:42:30  <colinclark> cool
2020-07-02T17:42:46  <dogeman> It's not a lot of work. Will add commits within an hour.
2020-07-02T17:42:51  <colinclark> thanks!
2020-07-02T17:43:03  <dogeman> np
2020-07-02T17:43:47  <colinclark> gmoss, Justin_o, cindyli: Once the latest Storytelling release is out, I think we should have a conversation about our general approach and to reflect a bit on our long-term technical roadmap
2020-07-02T17:44:09  <colinclark> Can we schedule a meeting to have a brainstorming session after the release is done?
2020-07-02T17:44:21  <colinclark> That was a funny sentence…
2020-07-02T17:44:32  <colinclark> Schedule a meeting to brainstorm together, I mean
2020-07-02T17:46:08  <gmoss> colinclark: haha it's an interesting combination of words :) yes I think that would be valuable to have that conversation. I'm available all week next week except the usual times and on the 8th at 11:00. cindyli and Justin_o?
2020-07-02T17:50:42  <cindyli> gmoss, my availability is almost same as yours except i won't be available every Monday and Thursday 3:30-4:30PM
2020-07-02T17:56:41  <Justin_o> gmoss, colinclark, cindyli: I should be able to make time next week as well, except Friday.
2020-07-02T17:57:07  <colinclark> Tuesday’s pretty good for me
2020-07-02T18:00:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: could you explain what this issue is "Race condition in Page grade event tests" I'm not sure if I'm hitting it.
2020-07-02T18:01:03  <Justin_o> The Story Page Tests are stalling for me
2020-07-02T18:01:18  *** christopher is now known as Guest9739
2020-07-02T18:01:37  <gmoss> Justin_o: I've noticed the same
2020-07-02T18:01:50  <gmoss> I have a couple screenshots and was going to file a Jira after getting through the other tests
2020-07-02T18:02:24  <gmoss> Justin_o: the stalling is the "race condition", my description may have jumped to conclusions :)
2020-07-02T18:03:04  <gmoss> depending on the browser/device they will stall more or less reliably. in Edge 44 it's ~90% of the time, while in Firefox for me it's ~30% and Chrome almost never
2020-07-02T18:03:46  <gmoss> colinclark: do you intend for michelled and danayo to join us in the conversation as well?
2020-07-02T18:03:49  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, thanks, I'll mark it with the same number
2020-07-02T18:04:21  <colinclark> gmoss: I’d definitely like danayo to be there, yes
2020-07-02T18:08:08  <gmoss> colinclark: In that case, I propose we just use the regular ST check-in time (12:30), or whenever Tuesday's Lightning Talk has wrapped up
2020-07-02T18:23:25  <Justin_o> colinclark, gmoss, cindyli: that should work for me
2020-07-02T18:23:37  <Justin_o> gmoss: how are the stories sorted in the browser stories list?
2020-07-02T18:25:06  <colinclark> tuesday 1230 is good for me too
2020-07-02T18:27:26  <gmoss> Justin_o: they're sorted by their internal db ID. Sorry I have to take care of something here at home, afk for a little bit
2020-07-02T18:27:42  *** Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2020-07-02T18:34:06  <cindyli> tuesday 1230 is good for me too
2020-07-02T18:34:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: back, sorry about that
2020-07-02T18:38:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: no problem. I'm asking because one of my stories appeared far down the list. See macOS Test 8
2020-07-02T18:39:03  <Justin_o> https://staging-stories.floeproject.org/storyBrowse.html
2020-07-02T18:40:49  <Justin_o> gmoss: also what video formats are supported?
2020-07-02T18:44:29  <gmoss> Justin_o: I don't think we have any "officially" supported formats. strictly speaking, whatever the browser you're viewing the story with supports. The upload element currently allows "video/*", though there are issues with .mov in MacOS, I believe
2020-07-02T18:44:46  <gmoss> I'll have to refresh my memory to be sure
2020-07-02T18:45:09  <Justin_o> gmoss: I was trying to upload an mp4 video but the the file open dialog won't let me select them
2020-07-02T18:45:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: that sounds familiar. I feel like there may be a Jira for that already
2020-07-02T18:46:17  <gmoss> Justin_o: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-222 and https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-354
2020-07-02T18:46:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-07-02T18:57:04  <Uttara> cindyli and Teddy___ is it possible to met at 3 instead?
2020-07-02T18:58:03  <cindyli> fine with me, Uttara
2020-07-02T18:58:41  <Teddy___> Sure lets do it
2020-07-02T18:59:01  <Uttara> okay will be right there
2020-07-02T19:34:15  <Justin_o> gmoss: for Test 17 when it says "state is not remembered on page reload", does that mean all state or just which screen of the workflow it is on?
2020-07-02T19:34:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: just the screen, i.e. forward/back history. This line was added before autosave was a thing, so it's a little confusing now. I'll rephrase it to clarify :)
2020-07-02T20:04:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: I saw that you filed FLUID-6525, it's a duplicate of SJRK-186 but I think we should keep yours, since as you say it's likely an issue with the prefs framework and not the Storytelling Tool
2020-07-02T20:05:06  <gmoss> I can put my details into the FLUID one once I'm done my testing
2020-07-02T20:05:14  <Justin_o> gmoss: we can link them together for now.. it's probably worth having an SJRK related issue in case anyone looks there for it
2020-07-02T20:05:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: fair enough. I've added a link, I'll just leave both alone then :)
2020-07-02T20:05:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: cool thanks
2020-07-02T20:06:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: so I'm noticing that the uploaded media disappears when the page is refreshed.. I didn't see a jira about this but checking in case I missed it
2020-07-02T20:07:26  <gmoss> Justin_o: this is related to how we rolled out autosave. SJRK-289 pull request will solve that, once it's ready
2020-07-02T20:07:55  <gmoss> right now it only saves text content, but we had to do some server-side refactoring to get files to persist
2020-07-02T20:08:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, I left a note pointing at that JIRA in the test grid
2020-07-02T20:09:05  <gmoss> Justin_o: great, thanks :)
