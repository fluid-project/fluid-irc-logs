2020-10-01T11:57:16  <Justin_o> sbates: thanks for the e-mail about Hacktoberfest. Do you think we should send that out to the fluid-work mailing list as well?
2020-10-01T12:20:52  <sbates> Justin_o: we could, how would you feel about forwarding it?
2020-10-01T12:25:25  <sbates> or would it be better if I just sent it directly?
2020-10-01T12:26:08  <Justin_o> sbates: whatever you prefer is fine with me.
2020-10-01T12:27:07  <sbates> Justin_o: if you could forward it, that would be great, thanks
2020-10-01T12:27:33  <Justin_o> sbates: no problem, will do. and thanks for the detailed write up about it.
2020-10-01T14:21:46  <clown> Good morning colinclark
2020-10-01T14:21:53  <clown> There was a meeting about the next steps and Floe the other day.  Was there a pirate pad or other notes taken?  I'd like to stay in the loop.
2020-10-01T14:22:22  <colinclark> morning, clown
2020-10-01T14:22:39  <colinclark> I haven’t been taking notes, aside from my page in the wiki
2020-10-01T14:23:04  <colinclark> just trying to gather peoples’ thoughts and where the ideas fit with their projects (i.e. We Count, UIO, etc.)
2020-10-01T14:24:50  <clown> Okay, michelled gave me the link to the wiki page, so I have that.
2020-10-01T14:26:08  <michelled> clown: let me know if I can help at all
2020-10-01T14:26:27  <michelled> I wasn't at that meeting and may not have good answers, but I'm generally good at figuring out who will :)
2020-10-01T14:26:29  <clown> thanks michelled
2020-10-01T14:28:04  <clown> I'm going to start by reminding myself about what the GPII prefs service does now, get that clear in my mind so I can communicate to others and compare with their needs
2020-10-01T14:28:34  <clown> and any other things I might think of about that service
2020-10-01T14:29:37  <clown> a kind of brainstorming
2020-10-01T14:31:02  <michelled> that sounds great clown
2020-10-01T15:04:06  <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon3, Teddy___: are you coming to tech check in?
2020-10-01T15:54:06  <colinclark> clown: that’s perfect
2020-10-01T15:54:23  <colinclark> and then maybe we can have a call with Cindy and Antranig to talk about what the priorities might look like
2020-10-01T15:54:34  <colinclark> what parts of the old implementation we can get rid of
2020-10-01T15:54:39  <clown> sure, colinclark
2020-10-01T15:54:51  <colinclark> potentially whether we need to replace the backend with Postgres instead of Couch
2020-10-01T15:54:56  <colinclark> and then the question of auth
2020-10-01T15:55:13  <clown> yes, and other questions.
2020-10-01T15:55:28  <colinclark> both user authentication and how we verify that a web app has permission to act on a user’s behalf
2020-10-01T15:55:32  <colinclark> yes, lots of quetsions
2020-10-01T15:55:57  <colinclark> maybe start by writing down the questions that we should think about in a wiki page?
2020-10-01T15:56:06  <clown> do we need the ontology handler?  should the code be moved to the fluid-projecct?  keep/change the prefs safes/prefs sets data structure?
2020-10-01T15:56:22  <colinclark> i think we can likely lose the ontology stuff, but that we should talk with cindyli and Bosmon about
2020-10-01T15:56:36  <colinclark> probably simplify the data structure, yes
2020-10-01T15:56:42  <clown> For now, I've stared a pirate pad, but that's just for me to scrawl somewhere.  I can move that to a wiki page when it's more coherent?
2020-10-01T15:56:47  <colinclark> perfect
2020-10-01T15:56:49  <colinclark> sounds great
2020-10-01T15:57:56  <clown> I'm thinking I might be ready for some kind of meeting by Mon (but prefer later).  I may use some wellness hours tomorrow, and quit early — still feeling the effects of grinding out code from the past few days.
2020-10-01T15:58:13  <colinclark> ok cool
2020-10-01T15:58:23  <colinclark> you pick the day that works for you, and we’ll meet up
2020-10-01T15:59:05  <clown> cool, I'll do that.  I"ll see how far I get today and propose a date tomorrow sometime.
2020-10-01T15:59:25  <clown> It's amazing how much I've forgotten in just two months.
2020-10-01T16:02:15  <Bosmon> Well, we can get rid of practically anything
2020-10-01T16:02:22  <Bosmon> Er everything
2020-10-01T16:02:35  <Bosmon> I was speculating to the extent this should just be a ground-up rewrite ....
2020-10-01T16:05:21  <sgithens> Ahhhh
2020-10-01T16:05:41  <sgithens> Good morning #fluid-work
2020-10-01T16:08:14  <Bosmon> GOOD MORNING GITHENS
2020-10-01T16:08:32  <Bosmon> You have arrived just in time to hear us planning to rewrite the preferences server for the 7th time :)
2020-10-01T16:08:48  <sgithens> :)
2020-10-01T16:09:28  <sgithens> Will it coincide with a rewrite of the flowManager, or be merged in to the flowmanager itself?
2020-10-01T16:09:39  <sgithens> or just be its own thing with a login
2020-10-01T16:09:52  <Bosmon> It will just be its own thing with a bunch of oauth
2020-10-01T16:10:14  <sgithens> cool
2020-10-01T16:11:01  <Bosmon> It will be the thing that we had in 2013, with the bit of oauth that cindyli wrote in 2016, but minus all the insanity of "your preferences never leave the cloud" that we had to put in in 2015 : P
2020-10-01T16:11:02  <sgithens> phew
2020-10-01T16:11:06  <sgithens> that was a long winter
2020-10-01T16:11:56  <Bosmon> I mean, the whole idea of a "cloud based flow manager" was an insanity, based on the idea that there is anything to have a flow of in the cloud
2020-10-01T16:12:37  <sgithens> yes, unless you were trying to orchestrate a personalization across multiple devices or something
2020-10-01T16:13:22  <Bosmon> Yes, and based on this central religion that we suffered under for a full 5 years that "What comes down from the cloud is SETTINGS"
2020-10-01T16:13:33  <Bosmon> Which must never have been questioned
2020-10-01T16:14:02  <Bosmon> Which had to never have been questioned
2020-10-01T16:14:24  <sgithens> Some would recommend against it's usage all together
2020-10-01T16:14:36  <Bosmon> We need Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's "Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations" in order to talk about the condition of this project which is now in our past
2020-10-01T16:20:35  <Bosmon> So colinclark, clown - an answer to something I was musing about over the last couple of days - https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-http
2020-10-01T16:21:16  <Bosmon> It appears that it's totally trivial to take any express app and wrap it suitable for use in Lambda
2020-10-01T16:21:24  <Bosmon> Presumably there must the Azure equivalent of this too
2020-10-01T16:23:29  <Bosmon> Given that websockets is dead in this new world, there seems to be little upside into making this into a Kettle app especially if startup time is at a premium, so my current guess is that a bare-metal express app will be just fine
2020-10-01T16:24:20  <Bosmon> Well, here it is: https://github.com/yvele/azure-function-express
2020-10-01T16:24:56  <Bosmon> Despite the fact that Microsoft, predictably, would prefer that you abandon your existing idioms : P https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/shift-expressjs
2020-10-01T16:37:33  <Bosmon> Teddy___, philip_ - well, here's a paper : P https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vldb2010/pvldb_vol3/R72.pdf
2020-10-01T16:37:39  <Bosmon> But I think we don't need anything remotely this sophisticated
2020-10-01T16:37:51  <Bosmon> We don't need to recover the *actual* , or an actual, primary key
2020-10-01T16:38:21  <Bosmon> All we need is a column or collection of columns that functions well enough as a primary key, given two spreadsheets, that it causes them to become maximally aligned
2020-10-01T16:39:49  <Teddy___> Bosmon: I'll take a look
2020-10-01T16:39:59  <Bosmon> Teddy___ - don't look too hard, it's a pretty nutty paper :)
2020-10-01T16:45:55  *** jhung_2 is now known as jhung
2020-10-01T16:49:01  <gtirloni> Bosmon Justin_o: I haven't kept up with all the discussions around async/await but I was wondering if there's any value in running CI against Node.js 14.x to get access to new features. Any thoughts? Today we test with v10 (soon to enter maintenance mode) and v12.
2020-10-01T16:50:03  <Bosmon> gtirloni - no particular interest in the new features but I guess it will be good to get notice of any upcoming breakage
2020-10-01T16:50:22  <Bosmon> Looks like it is LTS shortly?
2020-10-01T16:50:50  <Bosmon> 27th
2020-10-01T16:52:17  <sgithens> colinclark: Are you still a fan of 11ty for publishing?
2020-10-01T16:52:58  <gtirloni> Bosmon: yep, for reference: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/
2020-10-01T17:01:01  <colinclark> sgithens: I think I’d say yes?
2020-10-01T17:01:11  <colinclark> We’ve certainly been doing a lot with it recently
2020-10-01T17:01:26  <colinclark> including greatislander’s work on the fluidic-11ty scaffolding
2020-10-01T17:02:02  <colinclark> btw sgithens, welcome home :)
2020-10-01T17:02:24  <sgithens> colinclark: Thanks
2020-10-01T17:02:30  <sgithens> it feels good to be back
2020-10-01T17:02:45  <sgithens> oh cool
2020-10-01T17:02:50  <sgithens> I should look at that
2020-10-01T17:05:48  <greatislander> colinclark sgithens building on initial GSoC work by Sachin Chopra + gmoss + jhung_2 + justin_o :)
2020-10-01T17:07:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon, gtirloni: I think adding node 14 makes sense.. and I guess dropping 10 when it leaves LTS
2020-10-01T17:08:43  <gtirloni> Justin_o: v10 is in 'maintenance' mode since May. I'll be dropped only on April '21. It might make the tests take a long time if we keep 10,12,14 across macOS/Win/Linux
2020-10-01T17:08:56  <gtirloni> s/I'll/it'll/
2020-10-01T17:12:34  <Justin_o> gtirloni: hmm.. good question... what do you think Bosmon? If we do that, we should send a message out to the community that we are only supporting 12 and 14 now.
2020-10-01T17:32:21  <Bosmon> We could drop 10 .... I can't think of anyone or anything in particular depending on it
2020-10-01T17:32:45  <Bosmon> The "old GPII" is on 10 I believe, but that has ceased to run in CI for a while, and I imagine its versions of things will never be updated again in any case
2020-10-01T17:33:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: there may be some of us in the community still developing with node 10 on our own machines.. but I can't think of any requirements for us to use 10 specifically.
2020-10-01T17:38:50  <gtirloni> SJRK Story Telling Tool is using Node 10 for some reason.. something breaks in newer versions I think. cindyli, do you remember that? Greg mentioned it to me once
2020-10-01T17:46:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: does Kettle have a dependency on Node 10?
2020-10-01T17:46:11  <Justin_o> gtirloni: ^
2020-10-01T17:46:35  <cindyli> gtirloni: i remember Gregor mentioned it but don't remember the detail
2020-10-01T17:46:52  <gtirloni> cindyli: np, I can check with him when he's back. thanks!
2020-10-01T17:47:11  <cindyli> sorry and thanks
2020-10-01T18:08:52  * clown waves at sgithens
2020-10-01T18:09:00  <clown> it been a long time, no?
2020-10-01T18:09:05  <clown> seems like just yesterday
2020-10-01T18:12:13  <Bosmon> Justin_o - Kettle runs fine in Node 12
2020-10-01T18:12:19  <Bosmon> I don't know about 14, but I guess we'll find out :)
2020-10-01T18:28:13  * clown waves at kasparnet
2020-10-01T18:28:22  <clown> long time, no see … not
2020-10-01T18:57:34  <sgithens> clown: It already seems like another life
2020-10-01T19:04:58  <clown> are you going to the Final Get Togther on Mon, sgithens?
2020-10-01T19:05:08  <clown> kasparnet ^
2020-10-01T19:06:02  <clown> "another life" sound like a Good Thing (tm)
2020-10-01T19:23:00  <sgithens> I think it is
2020-10-01T19:23:08  <sgithens> ;)
2020-10-01T19:25:18  <sgithens> clown: I'm not really sure, it's pretty early and during my usual yoga time
2020-10-01T19:25:26  <sgithens> I might play it by ear
2020-10-01T19:25:38  <clown> right pacific time for you.
