2019-09-19T15:52:40  <jhung> Justin_o - http://getbem.com/naming/
2019-09-19T15:52:56  <jhung> or http://getbem.com/
2019-09-19T15:53:05  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks I was skimming through that during standup
2019-09-19T15:53:22  <Justin_o> greatislander, simonjb: here's a reference to the fluid naming scheme. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards#CodingandCommitStandards-CSSNamingConventions
2019-09-19T15:53:53  *** danielcho <danielcho!~Adium@205.211.168.104> has joined #fluid-work
2019-09-19T15:54:13  <Justin_o> it came up quite a while ago, so I'm curious to know BEM aligns with it. Should we have one scheme for all of our projects, are different cases requiring different schemes, should we update fluid's or is it already the same?
2019-09-19T15:54:20  <greatislander> @justin_o I can quickly throw together an example of what those demo classes would look like with BEM
2019-09-19T15:54:32  <Justin_o> greatislander: sounds good thanks :)
2019-09-19T15:54:40  <greatislander> It's not that far off :)
2019-09-19T15:55:11  <Justin_o> greatislander: one of the things that we are concerned about for infusion is DOM agnosticism
2019-09-19T15:55:46  <greatislander> makes sense
2019-09-19T15:56:22  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.103> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-09-19T15:58:03  <greatislander> @justin_o I think this is a rough translation to "pure" BEM: https://gist.github.com/greatislander/803f42eaf923ec399a7aa9938bab0695
2019-09-19T15:58:05  <simonjb> Justin_o: BEM is pretty similar to the Infusion convention. Here's and example I made this morning (with no modifiers -- the 'M' in BEM) https://github.com/simonbates/c2lc-coding-environment/blob/C2LC-13/src/TurtleGraphics.css
2019-09-19T15:59:55  <simonjb> Justin_o: http://getbem.com/naming/
2019-09-19T16:00:14  <greatislander> Main distinction from Infusion convention is no `fl-`/`flc-` prefixes, different separators depending on whether a suffix represents an element within a parent (e.g. `.widget__titlebar`) or a modifier of an element (a variant, eg. `.col--flex`).
2019-09-19T16:00:41  <greatislander> Happy to chat about this at some point too if that would be useful/interesting
2019-09-19T16:00:50  <greatislander> +1 what simonjb shared
2019-09-19T16:04:38  <simonjb> Justin_o: the BEM approach also includes recommended structural organization for modifiers. So, one uses "block block--modifier" rather than "block--modifier". That is, the modifications are layered on. So BEM is naming but also some organizational principles.

2019-09-19T16:46:26  <Justin_o> simonjb, greatislander: sorry, I thought I typed something here, but it didn't show up.. so not sure where I wrote that message :(
2019-09-19T16:48:24  <Justin_o> anyways, thanks for the examples. at first look I was. a bit surprised at the lack of namespace. Particularly for things that are themselves frameworks and/or things that make use of frameworks or other libraries. Mostly to prevent naming collisions.. but I suppose there isn't really anything from keeping you from naming you block as "fl-progress" vs "progress"
2019-09-19T16:49:50  <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, it would seem reasonable to me to add a prefix for things that have a scope of use outside of a particular project
2019-09-19T16:52:18  <simonjb> I've been thinking over using a prefix for C2LC but have decided not to initially (to keep names as concise/simple as I reasonably can)
2019-09-19T16:54:15  <Justin_o> simonjb: there's probably a lower chance of naming collisions as you have more control than say an infusion widget would.
2019-09-19T16:54:41  <Justin_o> so it's probably safe, and your block element in the example you shared seems a less common name too
2019-09-19T16:59:25  <Justin_o> simonjb, greatislander: without having actually used this myself, it does look like it would simplify the CSS and force you to think more about how you are writing your styles and what they are affecting.
2019-09-19T17:00:46  <Justin_o> do you get really long lists of classes on elements? and does it ever become a chore for composition to manage overrides. For example I have an element this is  class="block1 block2".  What happens if those styles are both affecting the same property?
2019-09-19T17:02:05  <Justin_o> there does seem to be a provision in the spec to do something like .block1.block2 {}

2019-09-19T17:30:55  <colinclark> oh danielcho, I did a quick Google Scholar search and there seem to be a couple of papers that describe clap detection. I don’t know if any of them would be useful for you, but it’s worth checking.
2019-09-19T17:31:47  <danielcho> colinclark: oh I could take a look, where can I access them?
2019-09-19T17:32:29  <danielcho> or just general search result from Google Scholar?
2019-09-19T17:32:52  <colinclark> Here’s a student thesis: https://pub.tik.ee.ethz.ch/students/2013-FS/GA-2013-03.pdf
2019-09-19T17:33:23  <danielcho> Thanks!
2019-09-19T17:33:30  <colinclark> trying to find the other two I saw
2019-09-19T17:33:59  <colinclark> https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8G450K8/download
2019-09-19T17:34:46  <colinclark> you might be able to use this miltary paper for peaceful purposes: http://www.ime.eb.br/~apolin/papers/ITS2010Izabela.pdf
2019-09-19T17:35:15  <colinclark> and I think you can probably get this one via the OCADU library site: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1520452
2019-09-19T17:35:32  <colinclark> I have no idea if any will be useful
2019-09-19T17:35:36  <colinclark> but worth a quick skim, just in case
2019-09-19T17:35:44  <danielcho> yeah definitely

2019-09-19T17:40:30  <danielcho> oh that would be a great help if I could get some feedback on my approach
2019-09-19T17:40:44  <danielcho> thank you for all your help
2019-09-19T17:41:30  <colinclark> He says:
2019-09-19T17:41:38  <colinclark> “I would look for spectral flatness as a starting point. It is great for transient detection and then sustained across an impulse will be different than a drum. If you look for the contour across the segment it will do pretty well.”
2019-09-19T17:41:56  <colinclark> “Simon Dixon has some awesome papers on the topic (though more onsets in general instead of clap specific)”
2019-09-19T17:42:16  <colinclark> I think he’s coming to visit the lab next Thursday, so you could talk with him then if it’s not too late
2019-09-19T17:42:27  <colinclark> Adam is, I mean
2019-09-19T17:42:40  <danielcho> sounds good!
2019-09-19T17:43:34  <colinclark> If you want to get super into DSP, it sounds like Dixon has lots of interesting work: https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9GvyqXEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao
