2020-04-09T11:09:56  <Bosmon3> Hi there - the-t-in-rtf, jhernandez
2020-04-09T11:10:24  <Bosmon3> With jhernandez help I got to the point that javjarfer[m] 's color vision filter windows pull can somewhat get through CI
2020-04-09T11:10:37  <Bosmon3> But the bad news is that there are actually no acceptance tests which verify the new settings
2020-04-09T11:10:47  <Bosmon3> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/311
2020-04-09T11:35:11  <jhernandez> Bosmon3: hey
2020-04-09T11:35:36  <jhernandez> happy that now it's "buliding"
2020-04-09T11:36:02  <jhernandez> adding acceptance tests is not that bad news
2020-04-09T11:36:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: do you know if simonjb got the npm-link issue sorted out?
2020-04-09T11:36:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: also when I was trying to test this yesterday I was having trouble running `npm install` for kettle because it has a dependency on lockdown v3 which doesn't working in newer versions of node

2020-04-09T12:21:19  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - I think you might have the virus on the brain
2020-04-09T12:21:23  <Bosmon3> Perhaps you meant leveldown? : P
2020-04-09T12:24:14  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - you're right that we can't currently npm install kettle on node v12 because gpii-pouchdb -> pouchdb -> leveldown ties us to leveldown 3.0.0
2020-04-09T12:24:38  <Bosmon3> But this is only a dev dependency of kettle so not too dangerous a problem in the short term
2020-04-09T12:25:02  <Bosmon3> Hopefully it will be fairly easy for the-t-in-rtf to cut a release of gpii-pouchdb that updates to pouchdb version 7.1.1

2020-04-09T13:58:23  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - I've not tried to use npm link for a very long while
2020-04-09T13:58:27  <Bosmon3> What is your use case?
2020-04-09T13:58:49  <Bosmon3> I suspect infusion is indeed unable to traverse the directory tree above the symlink location in order to find other copies of itself
2020-04-09T14:08:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: simonjb was trying to test some local changes to kettle with SJRK... The alternative that I suggested was to just modify the kettle instance in the SJRK's node-modules directory.. I suppose the fall back for more substantive changes would require committing to a git repo and changing the package file to point at that

2020-04-09T14:10:29  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: also rehashing an old conversation about converting Infusion to use ES6 modules. I assume doing so would address the need to dedupe but I might be missing something. Also are there any other barriers that would prevent doing such a thing. I wonder if we could at least file a JIRA about it.

2020-04-09T14:11:46  <Justin_o> simonjb: that's great :) not sure if you saw the previous conversation, but the issue you were running into looks like it's because the dedupe-infusion doesn't look like it will work running across symlinks

2020-04-09T14:13:14  <simonjb> Justin_o: I didn't create a symlink explicitly, but if that's what npm link is using then there would be a symlink

2020-04-09T14:15:23  <simonjb> Justin_o: I also initially tried just using "kettle": "file:../kettle" and npm install, but that seemed to also link the directories rather than copy (this may be a configuration option somewhere, possibly)
2020-04-09T14:16:22  <Justin_o> hmm.. yah, not sure about how that works.. but maybe.. I think it might just link to anything local. I read something about them not packing and just linking now, but not sure that was related to what you mentioned
2020-04-09T14:18:26  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - I think we decided that it might be possible to support Infusion on ES6 modules after all, since we discovered that dynamic import API that hadn't been particularly well advertised
2020-04-09T14:18:40  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - I've written up the gpii-pouchdb update issue for the-t-in-rtf as https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4442
2020-04-09T14:19:27  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - nothing is going to remove our need for Infusion's self-deduping since Infusion always needs to subvert the module loader's insulation in order to ensure there's just a single one of it in an entire application
2020-04-09T14:21:00  <simonjb> Justin_o: in docs for "npm install <folder>": "Install the package in the directory as a symlink in the current project" https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install
2020-04-09T14:21:52  <Bosmon3> simonjb, gmoss - I've published a dev release of Kettle which I believe fixes the issue as far as we had characterised it on Tuesday - kettle@1.12.0-dev.20200409T141107Z.a00af3d.KETTLE-82
2020-04-09T14:22:13  <Bosmon3> I'd be interested in the results of your passing it through any of the failure modes you have observed : P
2020-04-09T14:22:28  <simonjb> that's great, thanks Bosmon3
2020-04-09T14:23:01  <simonjb> I can update my local sjrk to use this new Kettle and run my tests against
2020-04-09T14:23:36  <gmoss> Bosmon3: excellent :) I'm looking forward to throwing it at my browser test! Thanks very much

2020-04-09T14:34:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: regarding needing a single instance of infusion. Is that basically so you can add something into onto the `fluid` namespace from one file/module and then access it in another, without also having to import that original file/module into the second place?

2020-04-09T14:47:00  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - as well as that, the fact that there is a single component tree
2020-04-09T14:47:05  <Bosmon3> And a single defaults registry
2020-04-09T14:49:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I guess on the web this isn't an issue because I already had to manually import all the parts that I wanted to access.. but it sounds like in node we've been doing things differently.
2020-04-09T14:50:11  <Justin_o> I should probably say in the browser instead of on the web
2020-04-09T14:54:48  <colinclark> Justin_o: yeah, Node’s whole architecture was designed around the idea that they would not follow the original JavaScript model of a shared global namespace
2020-04-09T14:54:56  <colinclark> I think it’s quite disappointing
2020-04-09T14:55:08  <colinclark> and the fashion for isolation and privacy has grown massively since then
2020-04-09T14:55:30  <colinclark> with ES6 modules being the most extreme manifestion of this “don’t trust anyone” mentality yet
2020-04-09T14:56:05  <colinclark> but at the heart of Infusion is the idea that applications can be changed, adapted, modified, after their original point of development

2020-04-09T15:06:35  <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, we would definitely want to maintain that ability to adapt and modify. I don't think I fully grasp all of the challenges yet, for needing the deduping, but it's probably that I'm forgetting a use case or would need to know more about the underlying mechanisms of the IoC framework.
2020-04-09T15:07:08  <colinclark> I don’t think it has anything to do with IoC
2020-04-09T15:07:36  <colinclark> it’s just that we have a bunch of (inherently) somewhat brittle infrastructure to work around the nature of the Node module loader
2020-04-09T15:08:11  <colinclark> and at the filesystem level, npm is just doing its job trying to make sure that two different versions of Infusion are indeed available

2020-04-09T19:19:05  <dmahajan980> Hi everyone, I have a doubt regarding the Preferences framework. As the docs say, three types of editors can be accessed using the loader grade. The docs specify the exact keywords that can be passed to `loaderGrades` property for only two out of the three types and no keyword is specified for the `full page, with preview` type. I tried searching through the docs but couldn't find it.
2020-04-09T19:19:05  <dmahajan980> So I wanted to know what would be the exact keyword for this type of preference editor that can be passed to `loaderGrades`?
2020-04-09T19:21:11  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: this is probably the one you want https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/FullPreviewPrefsEditor.js
2020-04-09T19:22:20  <dmahajan980> Thanks @Justin_o

2020-04-09T19:46:48  <colinclark> Justin_o: I sort of wonder about what we should do with Kettle and modern Node.js versions
2020-04-09T19:47:23  <colinclark> I’m assuming Kettle depends on gpii-pouchdb (which depends on leveldown) in order to test the CouchDB data sources
2020-04-09T19:47:48  <colinclark> which the-t-in-rtf pointed out turned out to be not very viable in the context of testing the GPII’s use of CouchDB
2020-04-09T19:48:14  <colinclark> he solution is to use anoother tool he has created, which will take care of launching a real instance of CouchDB in a Docker container, and orchestrating it with the tests
2020-04-09T19:48:29  <colinclark> but then I wonder if that will impact our ability to switch from Jenkins to Github Actions in the future

2020-04-09T19:58:40  <the-t-in-rtf> we can also close the loop on your GitHub Actions research, I'd like to hear about that (but not now)

2020-04-09T20:13:44  <Justin_o> I guess it will be something we need to research a bit. However, you can run GitHub actions against docker images, you don't have to use their hosted solutions. Or you could host your own runners.
2020-04-09T20:14:15  <Justin_o> https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action
2020-04-09T20:18:50  <Justin_o> colinclark, the-t-in-rtf: I'll be away till Tuesday, but we can talk again then if that works. I suppose we could also just experiment with converting something that uses the new approach, to GitHub actions.

2020-04-09T20:24:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: wondering where the conversion for naming branches with the "/" comes from.. and reason for that. I'm curious to know more. To me I find it a bit confusing because to access a remote branch you write like "remoteName/branch"
2020-04-09T20:27:13  <greatislander> Justin_o I've grown fond of it in my own work because it corresponds to the conventional commit standard (`feat: do something` = `feat/do-something`), and using the forward slash delimits the nature of the branch (feat, fix, try, etc) from the subject
2020-04-09T20:27:35  <greatislander> I don't know if it's a convention per se and if others don't want to use it that's fine, we can remove it

I don't mind the idea of the prefix, actually that seems reasonable. I'm more just not sold on the "/" part; maybe a "-" or something. Anyways, that's just my 2 cents. I'll leave things as is for the PR and you guys can follow up as needed.
2020-04-09T20:33:15  <Justin_o> greatislander: is there a way I can test the "release" options without actually creating a release
