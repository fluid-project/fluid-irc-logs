2020-02-04T13:08:30  <sgithens> with the SPI hacks still in the lifecycle manager from previous work, it should actually work without GPII-3119

2020-02-04T18:32:55  <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli1 : Just to recap from our early meeting today, do we think we can merge in GPII-228 since it can use the workaround in master for now, and only operates in the local flowmanager to capture settings? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/616
2020-02-04T18:36:50  <cindyli1> Bosmon's call ;)

2020-02-04T18:37:48  <sgithens> there's no reason why this should cause any issues
2020-02-04T18:38:20  <cindyli> sgithens: ya, i don't see issues for it to be merged
