2019-04-05T04:54:44  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, they're all drafts at this point, and I believe AJV (the underlying engine) is using draft v7
2019-04-05T04:55:09  <the-t-in-rtf> but we use our own variant, GSS, which is closer in some ways to draft 3
2019-04-05T04:55:39  <the-t-in-rtf> (we make "required" an attribute of the property that's required, rather than an attribute of its paren)
2019-04-05T04:56:15  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, if you're trying to research and actual problem or language usage question, hit me up with details

2019-04-05T11:59:25  <Bosmon> Hey there jhernandez
2019-04-05T11:59:30  <Bosmon> VVANTUNNETTH :)
2019-04-05T11:59:38  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey!
2019-04-05T12:00:07  <jhernandez> sup?!
2019-04-05T12:00:24  <jhernandez> ¿¿¿¿¿?????
2019-04-05T12:00:54  <Bosmon> hahaha
2019-04-05T12:01:05  <Bosmon> I hope that the fix is helpful : P
2019-04-05T12:01:27  <Bosmon> I think in terms of the code it is pretty much what we would want but it needs some kinds of test cases if we would want to get it into master
2019-04-05T12:10:02  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, the fix is helpful
2019-04-05T12:10:37  <jhernandez> or at least, it doesn't break anything and indeed pushes the language switch to the end
2019-04-05T12:10:43  <jhernandez> which is great
2019-04-05T12:11:48  <jhernandez> I'd say that now, "visually", looks like the way it works now is more appropriate
2019-04-05T12:13:57  <jhernandez> this is, when the explorer is finally restarted, there's nothing else
2019-04-05T12:14:40  <jhernandez> sometimes I could see the highContrast theme or DPI scaling changing right after the explorer was restarted

2019-04-05T17:14:59  <jhung> gmoss, alanharnum: Do either of you know if the UIO Wordpress Plugin is up to date with the latest UIO version in Infusion? I want to refer someone to it, but unsure what state it's in.
2019-04-05T17:20:42  <gmoss> jhung: I don't recall ever working on the WordPress plugin, sorry!
2019-04-05T17:21:03  <gmoss> My gut says no, fwiw
2019-04-05T17:32:51  <jhung> gmoss: ok. That's my guess too.
2019-04-05T17:46:31  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Ok, thanks draft or no draft though it's the default version that is on the json-schema.org examples on their website
2019-04-05T17:47:52  <sgithens> ALso, from this capture tool review yesterday I got a list of a bunch of questions about our solutions schema from lynn and bern, so it might be nice to go over those early next week at one of our 'early' meetings
2019-04-05T17:49:50  <the-t-in-rtf> some of the examples
2019-04-05T17:49:58  <the-t-in-rtf> a lot of the best examples didn't survive draft v5
2019-04-05T17:50:05  <the-t-in-rtf> there was a really good one from an astronomy group
2019-04-05T17:50:17  <the-t-in-rtf> but yes, "modern" is v7 for I think a few more months
2019-04-05T17:51:18  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, write to v7, AJV is really pretty friendly about the versioning, you can pretty easily pin to an older version temporarily if you need to
2019-04-05T17:51:33  <the-t-in-rtf> so even if v8 pulls the rug out from under us somewhat we have time to adjust
2019-04-05T17:51:39  <the-t-in-rtf> without giving up security, etc. updates
2019-04-05T18:09:46  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: I'll email you the notes and questions in just a sec, but some of the ones off the top of my head were like, whats the difference between divisibleBy and multipleOf, both of which we use in win32.json

2019-04-05T18:29:29  <the-t-in-rtf> which is the only thing you should use

2019-04-05T18:31:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I see some leftover instances
2019-04-05T18:31:26  <the-t-in-rtf> we might need to turn on additionalProperties: false to reject extraneous material in schemas
2019-04-05T18:31:47  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, good catch

2019-04-05T18:32:16  <the-t-in-rtf> there were also a bunch of "min" and "max" instance previously, which additionalProperties would catch.
2019-04-05T18:33:10  <the-t-in-rtf> just leaving myself notes to fix that on Monday
2019-04-05T18:40:53  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, obviously the GSS schema needs more teeth.  Just leaving myself notes for Monday.
2019-04-05T18:41:13  <the-t-in-rtf> For now, just know that if you see "min", "max", "divisibleBy", those are all wrong
2019-04-05T18:41:16  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens
2019-04-05T18:43:39  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: You can thank lynn and bern
2019-04-05T18:43:55  <sgithens> they went through the entire solutions json with an extremely fine comb
2019-04-05T18:44:29  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, the validation pull was meant to catch all the cruft, I can see the hole in the fence now
2019-04-05T18:44:46  <the-t-in-rtf> it's good to have people checking things
2019-04-05T18:45:07  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I really hope they weren't just going through master, that would make me pretty sad
2019-04-05T18:45:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I have much much better data in my pull.
2019-04-05T18:45:24  <sgithens> hmm
2019-04-05T18:45:27  <sgithens> which jira is that?
2019-04-05T18:45:32  <sgithens> it was pretty craZ
2019-04-05T18:45:38  <the-t-in-rtf> it's the branch I just pinged you with
2019-04-05T18:45:44  <sgithens> oh right
2019-04-05T18:45:44  <the-t-in-rtf> the link above
2019-04-05T18:45:46  <sgithens> thx
2019-04-05T18:46:08  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/730
2019-04-05T18:46:08  <sgithens> the pasted the ENTIRE json file into Google Word or whatever it's called, and annotated it from there
2019-04-05T18:46:15  <the-t-in-rtf> le sigh
2019-04-05T18:46:32  <the-t-in-rtf> google ennui
2019-04-05T18:46:46  <the-t-in-rtf> they should just name it that
2019-04-05T18:48:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I am almost scared to ask, but link to their annotated JSON?
2019-04-05T18:48:41  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe they filled in some defaults I'm missing
2019-04-05T18:51:02  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Cool, so I'm about to generate a report from win32.json, and for all practical purposes I should do it based off your GPII-2839 branch today rather than master?
2019-04-05T19:00:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I really think so
2019-04-05T19:01:10  <the-t-in-rtf> I have cleaned up a lot of stuff even if I apparently didn't get all of the cruft
