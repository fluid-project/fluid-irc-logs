2018-12-05T11:31:26  <stegru> ah :)
2018-12-05T11:31:39  <dandimitrov> stegru, hi there:)
2018-12-05T11:31:45  <stegru> hello!
2018-12-05T11:31:56  <dandimitrov> ciao
2018-12-05T11:32:21  <stegru> I can make the changes you need, for the language names.. however, it will need to return a promise - would that be ok with you?
2018-12-05T11:32:59  <dandimitrov> Hmm
2018-12-05T11:33:22  <stegru> I need to spawn a new process to get the names in the current language
2018-12-05T11:33:32  <dandimitrov> Currently I’m listening for model changes of the two properties
2018-12-05T11:33:57  <dandimitrov> Interesting
2018-12-05T11:34:18  <dandimitrov> Yep I suppose it wouldn’t be a problem
2018-12-05T11:34:19  <stegru> the model on gpii.windows.language? or something else?
2018-12-05T11:34:45  <dandimitrov> yep, its model
2018-12-05T11:35:20  <stegru> well, that's interesting.. because I can update the model whenever the display language is changed
2018-12-05T11:35:28  <dandimitrov> Here’s my current approach https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/59/files#diff-bc658f47466ba31df21972f46d3f02d4R186
2018-12-05T11:35:56  <dandimitrov> Were you thinking of some other way of listening for changes :?
2018-12-05T11:36:22  <stegru> no, this looks ok to me
2018-12-05T11:36:41  <stegru> I just thought you where calling one of the functions
2018-12-05T11:37:41  <dandimitrov> well, I needed something to notify me when there are changes
2018-12-05T11:38:02  <stegru> oh wait, I already detect language changes - nevermind
2018-12-05T11:38:08  <stegru> no changes are required :)
2018-12-05T11:38:10  <stegru> from you
2018-12-05T11:38:16  <dandimitrov> great
2018-12-05T11:38:47  <dandimitrov> you’d probaly need simply to update the model once the promise is resoved :?
2018-12-05T11:39:10  <stegru> yes

2018-12-05T17:44:28  <javjarfer[m]> hi Bosmon ! Can I borrow you a couple of min?
2018-12-05T17:44:47  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m]
2018-12-05T17:45:30  <javjarfer[m]> hi! sorry, before I said I wanted to ask you a couple of things, but I wanted to have ready the last pull before
2018-12-05T17:45:37  <javjarfer[m]> but we are reaching end of day and you know
2018-12-05T17:46:06  <javjarfer[m]> better ask now
2018-12-05T17:46:50  <javjarfer[m]> So, issue is that yesterday I saw a weird behavior while executing the acceptance tests for GPII-3145, the pull that you reviewed to me today
2018-12-05T17:47:10  <javjarfer[m]> tests where passing flawlessly, but, since I updated with master yesterday, they start failing
2018-12-05T17:48:22  <Bosmon> Yes, what do you see?
2018-12-05T17:48:39  *** jhung <jhung!~Adium@dhcp-108-168-100-210.cable.user.start.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2018-12-05T17:50:52  <javjarfer[m]> then I realized (being 'then' a frame of more than an hour, in which I wanted to throw the pc) that it was a setting missing in the acceptance test payload
2018-12-05T17:51:43  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/636/commits/3f096d6ee09be8a5845a825d89e79faf24c58ed5
2018-12-05T17:51:49  <javjarfer[m]> which are reflected into that commit
2018-12-05T17:52:24  <javjarfer[m]> thing is, that without that, spiSettingsHandler was receiving a payload for the setting with no value
2018-12-05T17:52:38  <javjarfer[m]> and failing after the 12 expected retries
2018-12-05T17:53:08  <javjarfer[m]> and after that, the next settingsHandler for being called, which was the nativeSettingsHandler, was called with an empty payload
2018-12-05T17:54:18  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: any of that makes any sense? Or am I missing something here?
2018-12-05T17:54:23  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: I am pysched to talk about datablocks in the morning
2018-12-05T17:55:00  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - do you have a log?
2018-12-05T17:55:36  <the-t-in-rtf> me too, man.
2018-12-05T17:57:23  <javjarfer[m]> I can reproduce the fail and make one log for you Bosmon , it will take me a couple of min
2018-12-05T17:58:06  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - ok - and just perhaps to make an early guess at one cause, did you ensure to call "npm install" after updating from master?
2018-12-05T17:58:11  <Bosmon> Even if you saw no changes in package.json?
2018-12-05T18:01:01  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I don't think I make it the fist time, but then I delete the "node_modules" and "package-lock.json" for a complete clean install, and I continued seeing the same behavior
2018-12-05T18:02:09  <Bosmon> I did just run the integration tests on universal several times earlier today when I merged your retryingSettingsHandler pull and they seemed fine
2018-12-05T18:05:02  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "I did just run the integration t"> Oh, yes, this pull doesn't have today's master, is yesterdays master, I need to update it
2018-12-05T18:06:05  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I did also test against yesterday's master : P
2018-12-05T18:08:50  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: haha yes, I'm sure that master is okay, is this particular behavior what I don't understand, and I wanted to know, if it was expected or not

2018-12-05T18:11:03  <javjarfer[m]> well, this is my fault, I'm not being able to reproduce the same error as yesterday removing just that commit, I should have kept the logs
2018-12-05T18:11:23  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] ?! but if it results in a test failure, surely the behaviour is not expected : P
2018-12-05T18:12:53  <javjarfer[m]> right now is resulting in a test failure
2018-12-05T18:13:15  <javjarfer[m]> and the only thing I have done, is removing that last commit from universal
2018-12-05T18:13:25  <javjarfer[m]> I can pass you the tests file
2018-12-05T18:14:14  * javjarfer[m] posted a file: acceptance.txt (3570KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/ufdOJDOrvlFnxMUwoXBfCjoc >

2018-12-05T18:15:48  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I see it, yes
2018-12-05T18:16:24  <Bosmon> But which is the "last commit" you mean?
2018-12-05T18:16:34  <Bosmon> Not my last commit 2fdd2244 merging your settings handler fix?
2018-12-05T18:20:25  <javjarfer[m]> no, my last commit was fixing that problem
2018-12-05T18:20:51  <javjarfer[m]> I removed the changes present here https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/636/commits/3f096d6ee09be8a5845a825d89e79faf24c58ed5
2018-12-05T18:20:53  <javjarfer[m]> that triggers that failure
2018-12-05T18:21:25  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - but that commit hasn't been merged!
2018-12-05T18:21:43  <javjarfer[m]> of course! none of them are!
2018-12-05T18:21:56  <javjarfer[m]> this is something I have observed in this pull request
2018-12-05T18:22:03  <Bosmon> Well right - but I thought you were saying something crazy was happening in that you found historical test failures in master : P
2018-12-05T18:22:16  <Bosmon> ok
2018-12-05T18:22:38  <javjarfer[m]> ooooooh sorry, no. I just want to understand that behavior, and to know if we have something to fix there
2018-12-05T18:22:48  <Bosmon> So, javjarfer[m] - did you ensure to run npm install again after making your changes in the prefs sets?
2018-12-05T18:22:49  <javjarfer[m]> if this is expected
2018-12-05T18:23:21  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - and of course it is expected you will get test failures if you make changes in the core prefs sets without updating the acceptance tests to match them
2018-12-05T18:23:28  <Bosmon> Since these are what drive the acceptance tests : P
2018-12-05T18:30:51  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I was confirming that I did it, and the results are the same I saw yesterday, I have repeated the process right now
2018-12-05T18:31:06  * javjarfer[m] posted a file: acceptance.txt (3644KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/mViYpXLFNyPriEHjnHJkhuDv >
2018-12-05T18:32:09  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  that is from an execution done right now, with the modified preferences and further npm install

2018-12-05T19:13:31  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I will have to look in detail later, but yes, a change to the os_win7.json5 preferences is expected to cause an acceptance test failure
2018-12-05T19:13:41  <Bosmon> Oddly the failure doesn't mention the setting which you added, WindowsArrangement
2018-12-05T19:13:55  <Bosmon> I can't easily see what the diff is in this case - so what is the residual material in your pull if this commit is removed?

2018-12-05T19:38:51  <javjarfer[m]> Yes Bosmon , that's the weird thing, the setting is not mentioned and else there are another ones that appears wrongly or undefined
2018-12-05T19:42:43  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - a useful task might be a good patch for jqUnit.assertDeepEq : P
2018-12-05T19:42:43  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/jqUnit/js/jqUnit.js#L176
2018-12-05T19:43:06  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes well, you'll have to assess the residual content of the patch to see what you have changed.....
2018-12-05T19:45:01  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon , I see, so that is due to 'deepAssertEquals'? Is that the reason also for the spiSettingsHandler to keep retrying to set the setting?
2018-12-05T19:45:51  <javjarfer[m]> > javjarfer - yes well, you'll have to assess the residual content of the patch to see what you have changed....
2018-12-05T19:45:51  <javjarfer[m]> That's the actual code patch? Or the settings that are not displayed in the logs?
2018-12-05T19:53:44  <sgithens> Bosmon or really anyone.  Do you think there is a good spot in an existing repo to put this:  https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-provision/blob/master/gpii-provision.ps1    It's just for flashing a pile of USB Drives

2018-12-05T20:53:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I mean, you will have to understand what is in your branch, minus that commit .....
2018-12-05T20:54:17  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - all I was saying about deepAssrtEquals is that its console output is not very readable

2018-12-05T21:02:10  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "javjarfer - I mean, you will hav"> yes, I understand that, but it's expected that a setting from a solution which is not listed in the acceptanceTest, is checked against the payload? Because that's what I can interpret from the output
2018-12-05T21:02:30  <javjarfer[m]> that the settingsHandler fails because one setting, which is not listed, doesn't have a expected value
2018-12-05T21:02:55  <javjarfer[m]> but there is no expected value for that setting because it's not listed and is never specified in the acceptanceTest
2018-12-05T21:03:15  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "javjarfer - all I was saying abo"> agree, maybe we can open a ticket for that

2018-12-05T21:05:28  <javjarfer[m]> which makes no sense, why is that being called without settings?
2018-12-05T21:05:54  <javjarfer[m]> and why everything is fixed, when all the settings for the solution have a value specified in the acceptanceTest?

2018-12-05T21:08:18  <stegru> sgithens, I also have something vaguely similar - we need a "utils" repo
2018-12-05T21:09:09  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - so what is the diff between expected and actual - which solution is having its settings chacked?
2018-12-05T21:09:39  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - ok, I see it in your paste
2018-12-05T21:10:02  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I can't really help you until you can explain what you changed : P

2018-12-05T22:55:58  <sgithens> javjarfer[m]: Somewhere in the windows repo might make sense... though I think that directory  is for provisioning the testing VM's
