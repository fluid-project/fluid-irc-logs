2020-07-24T14:28:36  <Guest67712> Hello guys any news on the next years GSoC ?
2020-07-24T17:19:49  <Bosmon> cindyli, philip, the-t-in-rtf - was just looking through data assimilation libraries for We Count
2020-07-24T17:19:58  <Bosmon> I referenced "Frictionless data" in my PPIG 2019 paper
2020-07-24T17:20:12  <Bosmon> Looking through their source, I find they have some weird schema stuff of their own: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-js/blob/master/src/schema.js
2020-07-24T17:21:46  <Bosmon> gtirloni - I was noticing that the MacOS CI for my latest pull seems to be jammed - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/972/checks?check_run_id=907262900
2020-07-24T17:21:54  <Bosmon> Do you think this is likely to be a genuine failure or a provisioning problem?
2020-07-24T17:22:04  <Bosmon> I can't unfold the "Browser Tests" dropdown to get any feedback
2020-07-24T17:22:29  <gtirloni> when I had that behavior, it was usually something on GitHub's side
2020-07-24T17:22:36  <Bosmon> ok cool
2020-07-24T17:22:47  <gtirloni> you can cancel the workflow and try again, if it continues, I can try the support folks
2020-07-24T17:24:42  <Bosmon> I still can't see where in the UI to try again : P
2020-07-24T17:25:14  <Bosmon> For some reason the Cancel button is still there
2020-07-24T17:25:17  <Bosmon> Is that where it is meant to appear?
2020-07-24T17:27:57  <gtirloni> yeah, 're-run all jobs'
2020-07-24T17:28:07  <gtirloni> in the dropdown
2020-07-24T17:29:01  <gtirloni> do you see it? maybe it's a permissions problem
2020-07-24T17:44:08  <philip> Bosmon: that table/schema library looks kind of neat. Are you thinking we might build pragmatic schema transformation lenses on top of (something like) this?
2020-07-24T17:48:03  <Bosmon> philip: Well, not specifically
2020-07-24T17:48:12  <Bosmon> This is just a "survey the territory" type thing for now
2020-07-24T17:49:12  <Bosmon> gtirloni - where's the dropdown?
2020-07-24T17:49:56  <gtirloni> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/I4Tz0rvD/image.png
2020-07-24T17:50:02  <gtirloni> it's there, but i've already re-run it..
2020-07-24T17:50:08  <Bosmon> philip - But yes, I imagine the "visualisation" would attempt to suggest renderings based on some schematic information
2020-07-24T17:50:22  <Bosmon> It might even be the role for a limited kind of .... mACCHINE LURNING.... that might make Jutta happy
2020-07-24T17:50:33  <gtirloni> i could briefly see the results from the browser tests on macOS, but it seems stuck again now.. I've noticed this behavior in other builds (on non-macOS tasks)
2020-07-24T17:54:51  <philip> Bosmon: Maybe it's because I've recently been annoyed by inferred cell types in spreadsheets, but I'm interested in developing good UI examples of "soft schema", like Luke Church's "forgiving relations"
2020-07-24T17:55:06  <Bosmon> Yes, exactly
2020-07-24T17:55:11  <Bosmon> I think that would be highly interesting
2020-07-24T17:58:02  <gtirloni> Bosmon: it's stuck again, I'll contact support
2020-07-24T17:58:40  <Bosmon> gtirloni - thanks very much
