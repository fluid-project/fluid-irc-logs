2020-02-10T09:23:28  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I'm looking into the validation errors Amarja reported.

2020-02-10T09:26:51  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, IRC blocked the full content, but the problem setting is: "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.windows.mouseSettings": {

2020-02-10T09:27:31  <the-t-in-rtf> The validation error indicates that "additionalProperties" fails, which means it saw a field it wasn't expecting
2020-02-10T09:28:03  <the-t-in-rtf> Which makes total sense, as the field name has changed.
2020-02-10T09:28:07  <the-t-in-rtf> to "SwapMouseButtonsConfig"
2020-02-10T09:29:20  <the-t-in-rtf> Checking to see when that changed, but the solution is either to push the name change through to the client, or to change the name in the cloud back.

2020-02-10T15:37:02  <Shyamal> Thanks @the-t-in-rtf! I have shortlisted a few projects from the ideas list of GSOC 2020. Can you guide me as to how shall I proceed further with it?
2020-02-10T15:38:48  <the-t-in-rtf> depends on the project, but in general, talk to us about which topics are of interest, learn about how we work, get to know the community
2020-02-10T15:39:26  <the-t-in-rtf> which projects were you interested in?
2020-02-10T15:40:19  <Shyamal> I am interested in the following:
2020-02-10T15:40:19  <Shyamal> 1. Port UIO+ Chrome Extension to Firefox and Safari
2020-02-10T15:40:19  <Shyamal> 2. Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid
2020-02-10T15:44:28  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o can talk to you about the first
2020-02-10T15:44:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm the one to talk to about the second

2020-02-10T15:51:56  <Shyamal> Thanks @Justin_o. I have started to explore both these projects so I don't have any particular questions related to both of them. Maybe I should explore a bit more.
2020-02-10T15:51:56  <Shyamal> But I do have a question. Will my code contributions before the GSOC period be counted as a criteria of selection for GSOC?

2020-02-10T16:01:52  <Shyamal> Okay. Thanks for answering my questions!
2020-02-10T16:02:32  <Justin_o> Shyamal: If we are accepted, during the student application period we will expect that you are involved in the community and showing an understanding of the project, code, and etc.

2020-02-10T16:26:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm looking into GPII-4218 regarding the discussion we had last week about producing two extensions for UIO+. This has lead me down to start exploring bundlers to see if they would make things easier. I haven't used them before and after some initial research I'm still unclear if they would actually help with this case. If you have any thoughts please let me know.
2020-02-10T16:28:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also with this I was looking at ES6 modules. I'm thinking that post Infusion 3.0 we should re-write Infusion as an ES6 module(s). Any thoughts on that?
2020-02-10T16:34:53  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, my thoughts are that it will be both impossible and self-defeating :)
2020-02-10T16:36:42  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm not sure about bundlers - do we need to do more than change a metadata option supplied to the extension?
2020-02-10T16:39:32  <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the code switch it will probably just be some config changes to not include the WebSocket portion.. maybe using context awareness. So the UIO+ with morphic may just contain 1 additional JS file that is run in the background portion.
2020-02-10T16:39:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: however, we'll need to actually package separate extensions which will also include a new manifest file with a different extension name
2020-02-10T16:40:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  so at a minimum there will be two files different. But possibly different icons used as well, not sure about that yet.

2020-02-10T16:43:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so I'll have to at least re-write the current build, which I already partially re-wrote in the directory restructuring PR to output two builds. Largely these will be identical, so I'm trying to reduce duplication as much as possible.
2020-02-10T16:45:09  <javjarfer[m]> hi there Bosmon !
2020-02-10T16:45:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: regarding ES6 modules, I think we should look into them at least for Infusion as they are part of the spec and are supported in all modern browsers. I think increasingly we'll see a shift to users expecting to use infusion as a module. I think we could probably just export fluid as a module. What do you think makes it impossible and self-defeating?
2020-02-10T16:46:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o - because it will prevent us from accessing globals in the user's space, or from any form of dynamic imports
2020-02-10T16:46:25  <Bosmon> ES6 modules will forever be a closed book to us, because the entire ideology they are based on is opposed to Infusion's

2020-02-10T16:46:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also node is starting to support ESM modules so in theory we'll be able to more easily move between browser and server, possibly making use of something like https://www.snowpack.dev/#runs-in-every-browser to make referring to node dependencies in the browser easier.
2020-02-10T16:46:39  <Bosmon> Thankfully node's module system will always remain as a countervailing power centre
2020-02-10T16:47:11  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in theory, yes, but in practice, only at the cost of defeating each one of our architectural and technosocial aims : P
2020-02-10T16:47:31  <Bosmon> Node will start to support ESM modules but thankfully it will never be able to afford dropping its own ones
2020-02-10T16:48:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: not really sure how this is different than the node system already, I mean, we already have to support Infusion as a module there right?
2020-02-10T16:48:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the module systems are extremely different
2020-02-10T16:49:16  <Bosmon> We're not saying Infusion can't coexist with and support module systems, this is specially about ES6 modules
2020-02-10T16:50:08  <Bosmon> This was a system invented by Google to make sure that they can stamp on any possible dynamism in the web platform, as they once tried before with "Web Components"
2020-02-10T16:50:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess what I want is for Infusion to work in a module system.. that is my system can import Infusion as an ES6 module
2020-02-10T16:52:06  <Bosmon> Justin_o - but then Infusion would stop working : P
2020-02-10T16:52:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you also elaborate more on what in the ES6 modules causes the specific issue.. it would be good to write this up somewhere too I think if we have any limitations or special conditions for working in systems with them

2020-02-10T16:57:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon: Is there no way around it not working? I don't know what the problem is exactly so it's a bit unclear to me.
2020-02-10T17:09:08  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it looks like they have allowed for there to be a programmatic loader, but they have not specified it ..... https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_module-loader-api
2020-02-10T17:10:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: from what I read there is an api via System which can be used and returns a promise
2020-02-10T17:11:32  <Justin_o> okay, yes the thing you linked to is the method I've seen
2020-02-10T17:12:05  <Bosmon> The "System" global is not listed on MDN

2020-02-10T17:19:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think they may have just gotten rid of the "System" namespace
2020-02-10T17:19:58  <Justin_o> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
2020-02-10T17:20:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yowch : P
2020-02-10T17:20:34  <Justin_o> if you look at the dynamic imports section, sorry couldn't link directly to it
2020-02-10T17:20:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - this motivation section is pretty hilarious - "The goal for ECMAScript 6 modules was to create a format that both users of CommonJS and of AMD are happy with"
2020-02-10T17:21:17  <Bosmon> So they then list the features of CommonJS which they then supported, and then the features of AMD which they then rejected : P
2020-02-10T17:21:41  <Bosmon> It's a bit Trumpian in its notion of creating a format with which two communities can be happy : P

2020-02-10T17:22:14  <Justin_o> I think it's mostly the asynchronous part, and removal of some dynamic features that are more amd like
2020-02-10T17:23:03  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, those were the features of AMD that they list, tending to make AMD users happy : P
2020-02-10T17:23:04  <Bosmon> https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_modules-in-javascript
2020-02-10T17:23:38  <Bosmon> "Similarly to AMD, they have direct support for asynchronous loading and configurable module loading." - only, in practice, they don't
2020-02-10T17:25:19  <Justin_o> they don't?
2020-02-10T17:25:23  <Bosmon> Ah no, it looks like something did get implemented - https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module-dynamic-import
2020-02-10T17:25:33  <Bosmon> I guess it's just this book is out of date about the expected syntax
2020-02-10T17:30:23  <Justin_o> looks like the support is really good for that too
