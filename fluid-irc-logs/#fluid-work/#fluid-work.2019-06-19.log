2019-06-19T13:01:07  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon2, is there a way to look up a fluid.resolveRootSingle instance that you know should already exist outside of an IoC reference?
2019-06-19T13:01:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I am updating universal to use the new global validator, the previous tests were non-Fluid-IoC tests
2019-06-19T13:01:46  <the-t-in-rtf> I can of course rewrite them, but I thought I'd ask.

2019-06-19T13:22:54  <the-t-in-rtf> Even thought they weren't full Fluid IoC tests, all of the affected tests were components with their own runner.

2019-06-19T17:06:28  <sgithens> where you saying my name on the meeting?
2019-06-19T17:06:42  <sgithens> cindyli
2019-06-19T17:06:45  <cindyli> line 33
2019-06-19T17:06:48  <cindyli> in the pad
2019-06-19T17:07:04  <cindyli> the detail is down below from line 138, in the same pad
2019-06-19T17:07:42  <cindyli> is Friday a good time for you to have a meeting about this, sgithens?
2019-06-19T17:07:47  <cindyli> and Bosmon2
2019-06-19T17:07:56  <sgithens> would it be possible to do it at my early time?
2019-06-19T17:08:16  <cindyli> 4:30AM your time, 7:30 AM my time?
2019-06-19T17:08:17  <cindyli> sure
2019-06-19T17:08:18  <sgithens> 4:30 PST / 7:30 EST ?
2019-06-19T17:08:19  <sgithens> awesome
2019-06-19T17:08:22  <sgithens> for sure
2019-06-19T17:08:41  <sgithens> thanks much cindyli
2019-06-19T17:09:03  <sgithens> this requires migrating the existing data in Couch right?
2019-06-19T17:09:05  <cindyli> sgithens: i will double check with Tyler. this might be his early time too ;)
2019-06-19T17:09:07  <sgithens> looking at your notes
2019-06-19T17:09:08  <cindyli> yes
2019-06-19T17:09:23  <sgithens> I think it would be 8:30AM for tyler
2019-06-19T17:09:33  <cindyli> ok
2019-06-19T17:09:42  <sgithens> cool, I'll look at it today to see if I can whip it up with the migration stuff I'm working on
2019-06-19T17:09:54  <sgithens> I believe he's in mountain time
2019-06-19T17:10:00  <cindyli> thanks, sgithens
2019-06-19T17:10:09  <cindyli> Bosmon2: is this time good for you on Friday ^
2019-06-19T17:10:10  <jhernandez> sgithens: yes, Tyler is in mountain time
2019-06-19T17:11:14  <cindyli> sgithens: man, that's tyler's 5:30AM
2019-06-19T17:11:35  <cindyli> it doesn't work for him
2019-06-19T17:11:46  <sgithens> oh right oops
2019-06-19T17:11:54  <sgithens> somehow I added 3 hours
2019-06-19T17:13:01  <cindyli> sgithens: would there be a later time work for you?
2019-06-19T17:13:41  <sgithens> how about 7 PST 8 Mountain 10 EST
2019-06-19T17:14:08  <cindyli> good for me. checking with tyler...
2019-06-19T17:15:15  <cindyli> cheers, it works for him. i will send an invite
2019-06-19T17:15:17  <michelled> the-t-in-rtf: it looks like we've got some JIRA spam :( https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6379
2019-06-19T17:15:24  <sgithens> cindyli: thanks!
2019-06-19T17:15:42  <cindyli> thank YOU!
2019-06-19T17:16:39  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that's one of the downsides of allowing self-signup
2019-06-19T17:17:01  <michelled> I guess that's the only strategy? disallowing self sign up?
2019-06-19T17:17:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not sure if there are newer strategies, I'd have to look around
2019-06-19T17:17:44  <the-t-in-rtf> it'd be nice if there's a plugin to add email validation or something
2019-06-19T17:18:21  <michelled> don't worry about it- it doesn't look like it's too bad yet
2019-06-19T17:18:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I see that we do have the incredibly old Captcha layer that comes with JIRA
2019-06-19T17:18:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Let's make it a bigger thing if it comes up more often?
2019-06-19T17:18:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I don't mind looking around over a cup of coffee and making recommendations
2019-06-19T17:19:03  <michelled> sounds good
2019-06-19T17:20:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't think we have the kinds of problems you'd have if (for example) you were using JIRA to create tickets based on emails
2019-06-19T17:20:18  <the-t-in-rtf> so at least there's that
2019-06-19T17:20:40  <michelled> right
2019-06-19T17:21:19  <the-t-in-rtf> that was definitely a headache back in the day

2019-06-19T20:02:30  <gmoss> cindyli: I didn't a few days ago, iirc, but I can try again! I'm going to be back online a little later today, I'll try that out. It's possible it wasn't working but I usually run node and browser tests before opening a PR..
2019-06-19T20:07:20  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss

2019-06-19T20:47:16  <alanharnum> simonjb: everything look all right at http://prototype.codelearncreate.org/?
2019-06-19T20:49:47  <simonjb> can we do https alanharnum? I believe that it is needed for Bluetooh and for PWA support
2019-06-19T20:50:46  <alanharnum> simonjb: hm. I am uncertain whether or not our cert renewal process with letsencrypt would play well with whatever avtar set up for Netlify.
2019-06-19T20:51:09  <alanharnum> where the https://www.codelearncreate.org/ site is hosted.
2019-06-19T20:51:50  <simonjb> what do we need to do to figure that out?
2019-06-19T20:52:28  <alanharnum> I'll need to consult with Avtar on what he did for Netlify
2019-06-19T20:52:38  <simonjb> ok, cool
2019-06-19T20:53:06  <alanharnum> I am fairly certain if we issue a letsencrypt certificate using our process for the codelearncreate.org domain it will expire the certificate issued via netlify
2019-06-19T20:53:22  <alanharnum> which is not desirable
2019-06-19T20:53:45  <simonjb> keeping the main site happy is definitely higher priority than this new one :)
2019-06-19T20:54:44  <simonjb> ok, let's chat with Avtar when he's available and see what we can do
2019-06-19T20:55:06  <simonjb> michelled ^
2019-06-19T20:55:43  <alanharnum> simonjb: does the prototype need Bluetooth and PWA now, or is this for the future?
2019-06-19T20:59:14  <simonjb> alanharnum: we need bluetooth now, for talking to the robots, for example if you go to https://simonbates.github.io/c2lc-exploratory/ in Chrome you'll see buttons to connect to Dash and Sphero, whereas those are not displayed at http://prototype.codelearncreate.org/ (navigator.bluetooth is undefined)
2019-06-19T20:59:34  <simonjb> the PWA support is not yet in master but is ready to merge
2019-06-19T21:00:08  <alanharnum> OK - I'll talk to Avtar about this as I don't know enough about how he configured the Netlify setup (or have access to it)
2019-06-19T21:00:45  <simonjb> sounds good, thanks
