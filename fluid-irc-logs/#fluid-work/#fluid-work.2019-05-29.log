2019-05-29T07:43:21  <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon !
2019-05-29T07:44:56  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, JJ.
2019-05-29T07:45:12  <javjarfer[m]> Hey the-t-in-rtf
2019-05-29T07:45:23  <the-t-in-rtf> Not sure he's around yet, but you might get lucky depending.
2019-05-29T07:48:08  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks, np, I'm not in a rush
2019-05-29T08:17:54  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], where's the google sheet for RwG?
2019-05-29T08:19:04  <the-t-in-rtf> is this it?
2019-05-29T08:19:05  <the-t-in-rtf> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1orN-VYPY09UK1I6jld3GujQhPJrOVqM-vCBrsHxJbng/edit?usp=sharing
2019-05-29T08:19:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it looks empty
2019-05-29T08:19:48  <the-t-in-rtf> did you use one in your recent onboarding work with RwG?
2019-05-29T08:20:02  <the-t-in-rtf> Lynn is asking "why some settings and not others", I was hoping to show here the prioritised list.
2019-05-29T08:20:10  <the-t-in-rtf> s/here/her/
2019-05-29T08:23:43  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: I'm afraid there have never been a R&W spreadsheet of all onboarded features
2019-05-29T08:23:53  <javjarfer[m]> it's something that remains to be done
2019-05-29T08:25:30  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds like a great thing to do in the background during your next few meetings
2019-05-29T08:25:34  <the-t-in-rtf> and sounds like it's time
2019-05-29T08:26:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll copy you on the note from Lynn, she's reviewing the RWG settings based on a capture and asking why we have some and not others.
2019-05-29T08:26:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I think it'd be good to dump the full list of settings into the template and then fill out the ones you did
2019-05-29T08:26:35  <the-t-in-rtf> everything else is for the group to discuss in the onboarding meeting
2019-05-29T08:26:54  <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe just fill out the ones you onboarded
2019-05-29T08:27:02  <the-t-in-rtf> and then she can add any she thinks are missing
2019-05-29T08:33:42  <javjarfer[m]> > I'll copy you on the note from Lynn, she's reviewing the RWG settings based on a capture and asking why we have some and not others.
2019-05-29T08:33:43  <javjarfer[m]> anything we don't have is probably because it wasn't trivial to onboard with our current implementation of the XML settings handler, or wasn't exposed
2019-05-29T08:36:03  <javjarfer[m]> > I think it'd be good to dump the full list of settings into the template and then fill out the ones you did
2019-05-29T08:36:03  <javjarfer[m]> I agree, but I won't be able to attend it until before a couple of days, I'm right now with my pulls listed on tech-debt, maybe after I could try to address it, or we can discuss it in today's meeting

2019-05-29T09:01:31  <javjarfer[m]> I don't know why, but this function https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/772/files#diff-1e7b4157b5f31fe3620025d10feab28fR590 which is defined as a grade below, receives the correct parameters
2019-05-29T09:01:52  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/772/files#diff-1e7b4157b5f31fe3620025d10feab28fR590 while all of this other ones, doesn't
2019-05-29T09:01:58  <javjarfer[m]> they receive undefined for it's input values
2019-05-29T09:04:00  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: ^
2019-05-29T09:06:10  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - so which one for example receives undefined?
2019-05-29T09:07:18  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  setHighContrastTheme, applyCustomTheme, updateLanguage
2019-05-29T09:08:02  <javjarfer[m]> only one that receives it's proper values is "rm"
2019-05-29T09:09:20  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I think you are continuing to use the wrong grade names
2019-05-29T09:09:40  <Bosmon> The point of the "resolveName" system is that the tests are expressed using the real names
2019-05-29T09:10:49  <Bosmon> So gpii.test.integration.actionHandlersAware.windows should not appear in the test specification
2019-05-29T09:11:49  <Bosmon> Well, I doubt that this is the real problem you are facing
2019-05-29T09:12:14  <Bosmon> But in any case, before you finish refactoring, the funny "scaffolding grades" should be inferred automatically
2019-05-29T09:13:56  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - you'll just have to check whether the arguments are still there when the LifecycleManager comes to invoke the action here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L666
2019-05-29T09:18:30  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: great, thanks I will check there, I followed that pattern because I saw it here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-dynamicDeviceReporter-testSpec.js#L204
2019-05-29T09:19:01  <javjarfer[m]> so, do you think that part could be removed from test specification?
2019-05-29T09:19:24  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, it's perhaps not the best pattern to follow - the point is that the tests should be a realistic specification of what is tested in the real system
2019-05-29T09:19:40  <Bosmon> It is better to follow the pattern used by the settingsHandler mocks that infer the proper configuration automatically
2019-05-29T09:20:25  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay, will try to follow the settings handlers pattern after discovering what is happening with my arguments xd
2019-05-29T09:20:49  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - awesome, catch you in a bit!
2019-05-29T09:32:14  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I think I already know the issue, we can talk of it later if you are busy now

2019-05-29T12:28:10  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: so, the issue was regarding the lifecyclemanager session.localResolver from here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L936 get the values from the registry, these values are of kinds: ${{registry}HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\etc...."
2019-05-29T12:28:28  <javjarfer[m]> so, it returns undefined for them
2019-05-29T12:29:17  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - ah right, highly interesting
2019-05-29T12:29:55  <Bosmon> OK, so now you need some mock registry contents too : P

2019-05-29T12:32:29  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I didn't knew we have the ability to mock that resolver from the Mocks.js side
2019-05-29T12:38:09  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - you can stick a further mock alongside the env resolver here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L104
2019-05-29T12:59:34  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: Bosmon found the brightness issue - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/784
2019-05-29T12:59:39  <jhernandez> it was that
2019-05-29T13:01:28  <Bosmon> jhernandez - brilliant, it is now merged
2019-05-29T13:01:33  <jhernandez> great
2019-05-29T13:01:35  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-05-29T13:01:58  <jhernandez> will roll up a new dev release
2019-05-29T13:02:17  <jhernandez> for both universal and windows
2019-05-29T13:02:50  <jhernandez> and this will finally be out of our way :)
2019-05-29T13:14:23  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: knowing that I can mock that, I want to try it xd
2019-05-29T13:14:51  <javjarfer[m]> how would it be decided between the two env resolvers?
2019-05-29T13:21:51  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - but there will only be one env resolver, the other one is the registry resolver
2019-05-29T13:25:03  <jhernandez> Bosmon: there's also this tiny thing - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/130
2019-05-29T13:25:48  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, the validation pull passed following the merge with upstream.
2019-05-29T13:25:52  <the-t-in-rtf> it's as ready as I can make it.
2019-05-29T13:26:01  <the-t-in-rtf> (passed CI, I mean)
2019-05-29T13:27:59  <Bosmon> jhernandez - now merged
2019-05-29T13:35:25  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: but, then if current env resolver is fluid.identity... why it changes the paths?
2019-05-29T13:37:51  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I can't explain it - perhaps there is a bug in activating the standardResolverConfig in the correct test environments?
2019-05-29T13:37:55  <Bosmon> But - what paths does it change?
2019-05-29T13:38:33  <Bosmon> Cheers the-t-in-rtf, checking out now
2019-05-29T13:42:39  <javjarfer[m]> it changes the paths like this  ${{registry}HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\etc...." when are received as params
2019-05-29T13:42:45  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: ^
2019-05-29T13:43:31  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: if such bug exists, then maybe it's worth to take a look to it
2019-05-29T13:44:29  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - no, that is not a bug - variable interpolation happens before commands are passed to the resolver
2019-05-29T13:44:30  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L936
2019-05-29T13:45:20  <Bosmon> via this implementation: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/Resolvers.js#L67
2019-05-29T13:48:56  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay great, so this general resolution prior to the local mock resolution is intended behavior
2019-05-29T13:49:59  <javjarfer[m]> is this still a reality? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/Resolvers.js#L79

2019-05-29T13:52:42  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - it is still a reality, yes - although in fact this API has remained stable for 7 years, and will continue to do so : P
2019-05-29T13:53:30  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: haha well, after 7 years we can consider it pretty stable yes
2019-05-29T13:53:49  <Bosmon> Nonetheless the comment is accurate : P
2019-05-29T13:54:18  <Bosmon> Well interestingly the implementation comment is here actually claims the API is stable - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L2389
2019-05-29T13:54:23  <Bosmon> Although this particular usage of it isn't
2019-05-29T13:54:26  <javjarfer[m]> haha okay, then I wont dig more into this and solve it as we talked previously
2019-05-29T13:55:08  <javjarfer[m]> oh, extra hidden magic usages
2019-05-29T13:55:36  <Bosmon> I mean, it is not helpful that the comment claims it is a stable public API and then does not go on to document what it does and what arguments it accepts
2019-05-29T13:56:27  <Bosmon> Although I see there is at least some description of it in our public API docs: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCAPI.html#fluidexpandmaterial-that
2019-05-29T13:57:19  <Bosmon> Note that this week we have decided to deprecate the entire term "IoC" with respect to Infusion and instead to speak of its "Integration Language"
2019-05-29T14:03:18  <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks for the merge! :)
2019-05-29T14:10:19  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I agree that an example of usage will be great for that particular function
2019-05-29T14:10:20  <javjarfer[m]> also, wow, that's a huge deprecation
2019-05-29T14:14:15  <Bosmon> "IoC" was already unfashionable 10 years ago : P

2019-05-29T14:20:21  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I agree that infusion have enough differences with classic IoC for not being called like that
2019-05-29T14:21:15  <Bosmon> Our usage will follow this legendary paper of KELL which hopefully got off your reading list by now : P

2019-05-29T14:21:25  <javjarfer[m]> mostly because regular IoC is closed in it's extensions points, and infusion is not

2019-05-29T15:06:32  <michelled> Bosmon: we got the most amazing comment about the Nexus - it made it into the minister's speech! She said that she learned about pH from our science lab today :) and asked where we were when she was in school
2019-05-29T15:06:43  <Bosmon> That's just great
2019-05-29T15:06:50  <michelled> it was just a great moment!

2019-05-29T15:41:51  <Bosmon> I think the NOVA implementation is more important

2019-05-29T18:11:56  <cindyli> stegru: bryan_ is hitting this error at running windows tests in windows VM from gpii/windows repo:
2019-05-29T18:11:57  <cindyli> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Windows\resources\Themes\aero.theme'
2019-05-29T18:12:02  <cindyli> does it look familiar to you?
2019-05-29T18:12:33  <cindyli> jhernandez: ^
2019-05-29T18:15:16  <bryan_> Hmmm maybe windows is expired...I see that even when I try to change the theme manually it doesn't work because I need to activate windows. Could that manifest as a permissions issue?
2019-05-29T18:17:33  <cindyli> bryan_: in the directory where you started the windows VM, run this command: vagrant box outdated
2019-05-29T18:17:45  <cindyli> it will show if your vagrant box is outdated
2019-05-29T18:18:22  <cindyli> i believe ops team always publishes new box when an old box expires
2019-05-29T18:18:49  <bryan_> The daily's check if box is up to date... then back to the command prompt
2019-05-29T18:19:02  <bryan_> Should it be more verbose than that?
2019-05-29T18:19:39  <bryan_> vagrant box update says I have the latest version
2019-05-29T18:19:44  <cindyli> ok
2019-05-29T18:20:25  <cindyli> trying here…
2019-05-29T18:24:11  <cindyli> bryan_: when did you hit this error? at the start of running "npm test" or in the middle?
2019-05-29T18:26:32  <bryan_> Switching back to the regular version of universal seems to fix the permissions error (so far) so it is something in my PR that is causing it
2019-05-29T18:27:00  <cindyli> good discovery, bryan_
2019-05-29T18:27:10  <bryan_> Which is both reassuring and unsettling
2019-05-29T18:27:12  <bryan_> Haha
2019-05-29T18:27:30  <cindyli> agree :)
2019-05-29T18:28:12  <bryan_> At least I know where to start looking
2019-05-29T18:29:10  <cindyli> seems related to the high contrast theme, might be with "com.microsoft.windows.highContrast" solution
2019-05-29T18:29:54  <bryan_> I'll check there first
