2019-12-11T15:38:05  <cindyli1> Bosmon: regarding your comment - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/820, the first point of your suggestion is: i) Create a further event for the resolution of the default setting controls
2019-12-11T15:38:19  <cindyli1> the default setting controls is generated and used in pspChannel
2019-12-11T15:38:35  <cindyli1> while other suggestions are about handling all I/O in flowManager
2019-12-11T15:39:18  <Bosmon> cindyli1 - yes I see, I got this a bit upside down
2019-12-11T15:39:24  <cindyli1> my understanding about the first point was to handle the resolution of all default settings data in the flowManager
2019-12-11T15:39:34  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2019-12-11T15:39:57  <cindyli> right now, flowManager generates and distributes "defaultSettingsDataPromise" - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L118
2019-12-11T15:40:19  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, so you should make sure to resolve that promise in the flowManager too
2019-12-11T15:40:24  <cindyli> cool
2019-12-11T15:40:25  <Bosmon> Before you even attempt to create the PSPChannel
2019-12-11T15:40:34  <cindyli> make sense
2019-12-11T15:41:05  <Bosmon> Right now, we run a significant risk of failing on our core use case, which is to display the correct set of unchanged setting indicators in the QSS on system startup
2019-12-11T15:41:06  <cindyli> then flowManager can distribute resolved values down to pspChannel and stateChangeHandler

2019-12-11T20:58:19  <cindyli> ok. thanks, gmoss. will have a look
2019-12-11T20:58:23  <gmoss> Bosmon: hopefully we're not experiencing that same issue again, but I'll keep an eye on it! I'd first like to get the site working properly, then I will concern myself with performance afterwards
2019-12-11T20:58:30  <gmoss> cindyli: awesome, thanks!
2019-12-11T20:58:45  <Bosmon> gmoss - cool
2019-12-11T20:59:13  <Bosmon> A "finger in the air" thing to test is to try to see if the component tree is constructing multiple times, or if the bundles are loading multiple times
2019-12-11T20:59:25  <Bosmon> Since that was a big cause of the performance issues that Justin_o ran into a few years back
2019-12-11T21:00:01  <gmoss> Bosmon: i believe the bundles were loading every time we change locales, whereas before this update the bundles only loaded the first time they were needed, and seemed to be cached or held in memory after that
2019-12-11T21:00:09  <gmoss> Bosmon: I'll confirm this afternoon :)
