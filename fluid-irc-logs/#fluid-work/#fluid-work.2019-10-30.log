2019-10-30T17:03:26  <jhernandez> hey GPII'ers, arch meeting time!
2019-10-30T17:03:29  <jhernandez> :)
2019-10-30T17:07:23  <gmoss> ping the-t-in-rtf (if it's not too late on your end)
2019-10-30T17:07:37  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm in a meeting, so no?
2019-10-30T17:07:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I may take a bit to respond
2019-10-30T17:07:57  <the-t-in-rtf> we're an hour closer this week, BTW
2019-10-30T17:08:03  <the-t-in-rtf> so even if we don't get to it today we have options
2019-10-30T17:08:16  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: oops, sorry! it's not critical, I have a question about eslint-config-fluid
2019-10-30T17:08:25  <the-t-in-rtf> no, I meant, I'm stuck in a meeting
2019-10-30T17:08:28  <the-t-in-rtf> please go ahead
2019-10-30T17:08:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm here anyway!
2019-10-30T17:09:10  <gmoss> gotcha :) well I've been hacking away and some promise things, and I wanted to use .catch and .finally, but eslint is telling me those are syntax errors. I traced it back to this line in the config: https://github.com/fluid-project/eslint-config-fluid/blob/041cd0f476fc02d0293914962c14912750e753f5/.eslintrc.json#L26
2019-10-30T17:09:44  <gmoss> I was hoping to understand better why this is set to false, or to see if you (or anyone else here) had alternatives to suggest
2019-10-30T17:09:53  <gmoss> *and some = on some
2019-10-30T17:10:03  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a fair question, I think that was inherited slash translated from our JSHint days
2019-10-30T17:10:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I usually use the ["catch"] notation for those
2019-10-30T17:10:55  <the-t-in-rtf> longer term we should indeed discuss whether that check is valuable
2019-10-30T17:11:07  <the-t-in-rtf> or whether we should stop using keywords... ;)
2019-10-30T17:11:14  <the-t-in-rtf> (as variables, function names)
2019-10-30T17:11:20  <gmoss> :)
2019-10-30T17:11:33  <gmoss> if ["catch"] is acceptable then I'll use that in the short term
2019-10-30T17:11:50  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'd suggest filing a ticket and cc:ing myself and @Bosmon
2019-10-30T17:11:57  <gmoss> will do!
2019-10-30T17:12:13  <gmoss> thanks for taking the time to answer :)

2019-10-30T21:43:34  <the-t-in-rtf> cool, just at mention me
2019-10-30T21:43:45  <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise it's fine work for a Friday, not hard, just time consuming
