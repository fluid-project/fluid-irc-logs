2018-12-17T10:43:51  <jhernandez> Bosmon: stegru morning
2018-12-17T10:43:59  <stegru> hi
2018-12-17T10:44:16  <Bosmon> Morning
2018-12-17T10:44:29  <jhernandez> last Friday I continued diving into the high CPU load in electron
2018-12-17T10:45:04  <jhernandez> and as stegru poninted out a few days ago, the SVG animation is 100% guilty for that
2018-12-17T10:45:59  <jhernandez> I opened https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3597 and provided a pr to replace the svg animation with an animated gif
2018-12-17T10:46:34  <stegru> great
2018-12-17T10:46:47  <jhernandez> with this, the CPU load now is "normal"
2018-12-17T10:47:08  <jhernandez> it stopped growing
2018-12-17T10:48:35  <jhernandez> and now, when idling, the CPU load of the main process stays around 0%
2018-12-17T10:48:47  <stegru> wow
2018-12-17T10:48:57  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, that's great
2018-12-17T10:49:16  <Bosmon> But has this addressed the headline issue, of the perceived "slowness" in rendering the button UI?
2018-12-17T10:50:01  <jhernandez> Bosmon: not entirely :(
2018-12-17T10:50:42  <jhernandez> I can still see some delay when the machine has limited resources
2018-12-17T10:50:55  <stegru> well, jhernandez, you said the slowness got worse the more times you used it - has that problem gone?
2018-12-17T10:51:12  <jhernandez> stegru: oh yes, this is gone now
2018-12-17T10:51:19  <stegru> well, that's something
2018-12-17T10:51:25  * jhernandez nods
2018-12-17T10:54:22  <jhernandez> stegru: wait, I'm using my GPII-3597 branch, which does not include your improvements
2018-12-17T10:54:58  <stegru> ha
2018-12-17T10:55:04  <stegru> *face palm*
2018-12-17T10:55:13  <jhernandez> npm re-installing
2018-12-17T10:55:56  <stegru> they're in master
2018-12-17T10:58:40  <jhernandez> yeah, but gpii-app/master is not pulling the last windows/master
2018-12-17T10:59:09  <stegru> ok, that's good
2018-12-17T10:59:33  *** georgit <georgit!~georgi.to@37.157.190.158> has joined #fluid-work
2018-12-17T11:01:07  <georgit> jhernandez, Bosmon or anyone: I deleted the node-modules for the GPII app and tried to reinstall them. However, now I am always getting this error: https://pastebin.com/xhca4B0j
2018-12-17T11:01:30  <georgit> I tried removing the npm cache, removed the gyp cache but nothing seemed to work
2018-12-17T11:01:36  <georgit> Any ideas?
2018-12-17T11:01:43  <georgit> Have you encountered this issue?
2018-12-17T11:01:47  <stegru> georgit, that's just happened in CI
2018-12-17T11:02:13  <jhernandez> heh
2018-12-17T11:02:14  <stegru> oh no, not quite
2018-12-17T11:02:28  <stegru> ah, yes.. the same thing
2018-12-17T11:02:34  <jhernandez> and I'm also unable to complete the npm install locally
2018-12-17T11:02:44  <jhernandez> hmmm
2018-12-17T11:03:08  <jhernandez> on Friday it was working fine
2018-12-17T11:04:11  <stegru> so, what's changed? the wind direction?
2018-12-17T11:05:38  <georgit> actually, I haven't tried to reinstall the modules recently so I can't confirm whether "npm install" was working fine last week
2018-12-17T11:13:04  <jhernandez> doesn't make sense
2018-12-17T11:13:19  <stegru> builds ok for me.. twice
2018-12-17T11:13:41  <stegru> clearing the cache
2018-12-17T11:14:45  <stegru> master works for me
2018-12-17T11:15:07  <stegru> i must be doing something wrong ;)
2018-12-17T11:16:15  <stegru> G:\>node --version & npm --version
2018-12-17T11:16:15  <stegru> v10.11.0

2018-12-17T11:17:41  <georgit> v10.14.1 and 6.4.1 for me
2018-12-17T11:18:28  <stegru> CI uses 10.11.0
2018-12-17T11:19:01  <Bosmon> It would be a mean trick, to change the ABI in a minor release
2018-12-17T11:19:03  <Bosmon> But who knows : P
2018-12-17T11:21:36  <jhernandez> cleared my cache
2018-12-17T11:21:43  <jhernandez> and still having the problem
2018-12-17T11:21:46  <jhernandez> I have to leave now
2018-12-17T11:21:50  <jhernandez> :/
2018-12-17T11:22:09  <jhernandez> will be back in the afternoon
2018-12-17T11:22:17  <stegru> when the going gets tough, javi gets going ;)

2018-12-17T11:32:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm looking at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6303
2018-12-17T11:33:35  <Justin_o> gross started work on it, earlier and i'm continuing it.
2018-12-17T11:33:41  <Justin_o> gmoss
2018-12-17T11:34:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: something that I noticed is that by following the typical pattern we put the potential languages in the enum section of the primary schema https://github.com/BlueSlug/infusion/blob/FLUID-6303/src/framework/preferences/js/LocalizationSchemas.js#L68
2018-12-17T11:34:54  <Justin_o> however, it seems that most integrators would have to override this for the language options they have on their particular site
2018-12-17T11:35:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that seems correct
2018-12-17T11:37:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. so that's probably the best we can do at this point.. have a default primary schema containing an enum of the languages we have translations for the prefs framework in, and expect the integrator to override it
2018-12-17T11:41:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess they wouldn't override it, they'd actually have to always provide their own primary schema
2018-12-17T11:41:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, what do you mean by "not override"?
2018-12-17T11:41:36  <Bosmon> They'd have to get their schema in place somehow
2018-12-17T11:42:17  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it's picked up automatically during the prefs framework builder process. It's not really specified directly in the auxiliary schema
2018-12-17T11:42:33  <Justin_o> so i'm not sure what would happen if two primary schemas for the same type are found
2018-12-17T11:42:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - there could never be two, since it is stored in a grade
2018-12-17T11:43:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. I think we might be out of sync on this.. or maybe i'm just missing something
2018-12-17T11:46:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is how the primary schemas are pulled in when using the schema version of the prefs framework https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrimaryBuilder.js
2018-12-17T11:47:33  <stegru> georgit, try adding this dependency to package.json: "nan": "2.10.0"
2018-12-17T11:49:22  <Bosmon> stegru - wild
2018-12-17T11:49:38  <Bosmon> So I just did a clean build in my current VM after deleting the npm package cache, and it was ok
2018-12-17T11:50:01  <stegru> yes, then i deleted package-lock.json
2018-12-17T11:50:15  <Bosmon> It shows nan at 2.11.1
2018-12-17T11:50:31  <Bosmon> Except for leveldown in pouchdb which is at 2.8.0
2018-12-17T11:51:36  <stegru> mine was 2.12.x - a known good (in gpii-windows) was 2.10.0
2018-12-17T11:51:41  <Bosmon> ok
2018-12-17T11:51:50  <Bosmon> Very wild
2018-12-17T11:52:08  <stegru> ah, https://github.com/nodejs/nan/issues/832
2018-12-17T11:53:16  <Bosmon> Looks like it affects more versions of node than Flarna states]
2018-12-17T11:53:27  <Bosmon> Given we are on 10.11.0
2018-12-17T12:02:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this function ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrimaryBuilder.js#L109-L113 ) is used as the indexFunc in a call to fluid.indexDefaults

2018-12-17T12:02:38  <Justin_o> wouldn't that only retain a single reference to a given "type" that is, if we have more than one primary schema grade with the same "type" it would only pick up one
2018-12-17T12:02:45  <Justin_o> and i'm not sure which one it would find last

2018-12-17T12:03:16  <Bosmon> stegru, georgit - I can verify that manually adding nan 2.11.1 fixes the build
2018-12-17T12:03:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here is where fluid.indexDefaults is called https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrimaryBuilder.js#L48-L56
2018-12-17T12:03:38  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, the override would have to hit the built version of the schema
2018-12-17T12:03:48  <Bosmon> Which is a bit awkward, but there it is

2018-12-17T12:11:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: in addition to this the actual method of enacting will likely be different for different sites. In gmoss' implementation there is an event that is used https://github.com/BlueSlug/infusion/blob/FLUID-6303/src/framework/preferences/js/LocalizationEnactor.js#L30-L39 Which I guess we might need to make it globally visible though to make it easier to access. Another option would be to have an integrator provide the
2018-12-17T12:11:50  <Justin_o> implementation by referencing a specific function when configuring the enactor through the schema
2018-12-17T12:12:09  <Justin_o> or maybe we could make use of contextAwareness, but we'd probably need to pre-make a few options.
2018-12-17T12:12:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: any thoughts on that
2018-12-17T13:24:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, contextAwareness for enacting

2018-12-17T13:45:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: was also looking at this issue https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6312
2018-12-17T13:45:17  <Justin_o> about where to store the locale model value
2018-12-17T13:45:53  <Bosmon> Justin_o - are you going to have time to deal with this in 3 days? : P
2018-12-17T13:45:58  <Justin_o> if you look at the comments it's suggested that it goes to preferences.locale. however, when we use the schema the model values are keyed based on the type
2018-12-17T13:46:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) probably not, but i'll actually be around for the first two weeks in January too :)
2018-12-17T13:46:19  <Bosmon> ok great
2018-12-17T13:46:35  <Justin_o> my leave got pushed back by a couple weeks
2018-12-17T13:47:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it makes sense for it to go where the schema says it should go
2018-12-17T13:47:12  <Justin_o> related to where the preference gets stored, we have another issue where the grade and schema versions store their values in different spots https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5928
2018-12-17T13:47:27  <Bosmon> You can always add a relay rule if some other part of the architecture needs it to appear somewhere else
2018-12-17T13:48:08  *** georgit <georgit!~georgi.to@37.157.190.158> has joined #fluid-work
2018-12-17T13:48:29  <Justin_o> Bosmon: The problem is that we need to know what the type is ahead of time and also to know what's used and how to transform that from the type "fluid.prefs.localization" to what is used in the model "fluid_prefs_localization"
2018-12-17T13:49:11  <Justin_o> but the schema could also use a custom language type, similar to how things that need different schemas in UIO+ will use a different type.
2018-12-17T13:50:07  <Justin_o> so i'm wondering if we should take in another map into the schema that maps types to some value.. so something like {"fluid.prefs.localization": "locale", "fluid.prefs.fontSize": "fontSize", ...}
2018-12-17T13:50:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o - if there is an order of initialisation issue that the current framework can't deal with, it might be time to update to the FLUID_6148 branch
2018-12-17T13:50:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon: not really an issue with the framework per say, more for the person working with it
2018-12-17T13:50:55  <Justin_o> they have to know all these things that are being automated by the framework
2018-12-17T13:50:59  <Justin_o> to setup the config

2018-12-17T17:45:15  <jhernandez> there's already a pr that fixes the issue

2018-12-17T21:03:24  <Bosmon> Hi there bryan_ - how are you getting on?
2018-12-17T21:03:29  <Bosmon> Do you need help/a chat?
2018-12-17T21:06:18  <bryan_> I'm working on GPII-3595, the subtask of 3554...I was thinking, since the unit test is only concerned with the wmiSettingsHandler code, can I use proxyquire to mock the c# code? Seems more straightforward than hacking it to return a fake query
2018-12-17T21:06:18  <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, changing the animation really makes a difference
2018-12-17T21:07:42  <Bosmon> bryan_ - sure - was the "get buildnumber from os" route a nonstarter?
2018-12-17T21:08:11  <bryan_> It kept giving me error "invalid class"
2018-12-17T21:08:15  <Bosmon> arg
2018-12-17T21:08:27  <stegru> why not just only display it when the window is open via css, jhernandez ?
2018-12-17T21:10:30  <jhernandez> stegru: yes, but as far as I understand, all the windows are created (and hidden) at startup
2018-12-17T21:11:00  <Bosmon> bryan_ - sure, do go for proxyquire
2018-12-17T21:11:25  <bryan_> Ok I'll do that
2018-12-17T21:12:26  <jhernandez> stegru: I guess that we should ask Astea if that's a possibility
2018-12-17T21:14:10  <stegru> I don't see why not, jhernandez
2018-12-17T21:15:07  <jhernandez> stegru: feel free to comment on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3597
2018-12-17T21:15:38  <jhernandez> tonight I will provide another fix with a newer svg so we can compare results
2018-12-17T21:16:11  <stegru> ok.. I just removed the css rule in the inspector when I tested it
2018-12-17T21:17:00  <stegru> and by the way, it's actually 100% of a single core - windows reports the percentage of all the cpus added together
2018-12-17T21:17:00  <jhernandez> well, I will provide it after Bern gets an approval from UX - needs to go through it
2018-12-17T21:18:11  <jhernandez> it's in fact a new spinner
2018-12-17T21:18:15  <jhernandez> with the new logo
2018-12-17T21:18:16  <stegru> approval for removing something when it's hidden?
2018-12-17T21:18:19  <stegru> oh ok
2018-12-17T21:18:57  <jhernandez> the first one he gave to me had the same problem
2018-12-17T21:19:39  <jhernandez> but after changing the animation a bit, I found out that the CPU load wasn't there anymore
2018-12-17T21:19:49  <stegru> oh right
2018-12-17T21:20:27  <stegru> chrome doesn't have the same behaviour
2018-12-17T21:20:50  <jhernandez> stegru: I've just forwarded it to you in case you want to compare
2018-12-17T21:20:57  <jhernandez> ;)
2018-12-17T21:21:05  <stegru> that looks better

2018-12-17T21:41:34  <stegru> it's increasing for me, jhernandez - but it starts much lower
2018-12-17T21:43:25  <jhernandez> for me, it increases a bit in the beginning, but a few seconds after, it becomes to decrease until reaching ~1% CPU load
2018-12-17T21:43:38  <jhernandez> and it remains there

2018-12-17T22:02:45  <stegru> ok jhernandez - when morphic first starts (and I don't click anything), the cpu usage increases... but as soon as I display the spinner (clicking reset), it goes to <1% and remains there
