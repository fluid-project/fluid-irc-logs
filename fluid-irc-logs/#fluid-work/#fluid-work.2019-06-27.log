2019-06-27T13:56:41  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez, Bosmon , Hi there!
2019-06-27T13:57:15  <javjarfer[m]> I'm in a meeting with Amarja regarding his demo the other day
2019-06-27T13:57:36  <javjarfer[m]> and he got and error, that she keeps experiencing, I think she also got it with the
2019-06-27T13:57:47  <javjarfer[m]> last installer that she tried
2019-06-27T13:58:24  * javjarfer[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/snPiGTnicYlgqoIzhiOJnnGn >
2019-06-27T14:04:33  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: can we get more context of the failure? this is, the full trace?
2019-06-27T14:05:03  <jhernandez> and yeah
2019-06-27T14:05:29  <jhernandez> is she getting this when doing a prticular task?
2019-06-27T14:05:36  <jhernandez> is it at startup?
2019-06-27T14:05:59  <jhernandez> does it make the app to malfunction in any particular way?
2019-06-27T14:06:26  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: sure, I can send you the complete log, but that seems like the complete trace for it
2019-06-27T14:07:07  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: I'm in a debugging session with her, we are going to try to reproduce her steps, so, with luck I will be able to answer the rest of your questions
2019-06-27T14:07:20  <jhernandez> I only see this

2019-06-27T14:08:00  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I pasted you the complete file now
2019-06-27T14:08:53  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: ^
2019-06-27T14:09:43  <jhernandez> oh, I see
2019-06-27T14:09:49  <jhernandez> yeah, no more context
2019-06-27T14:10:01  <stegru> well, the stack is somewhere in the metrics
2019-06-27T14:10:23  <jhernandez> stegru: I was going to ask, yes
2019-06-27T14:10:43  <jhernandez> hmmmm
2019-06-27T14:11:03  <jhernandez> although ... I don't think her installer is reporting the metrics

2019-06-27T14:29:29  <stegru> of the last 500 errors, this has occured 115 times
2019-06-27T14:29:54  <jhernandez> interesting
2019-06-27T14:30:53  <stegru> we should be exporting these errors to a proper database, for our inspection
2019-06-27T14:31:16  <jhernandez> yes, kibana is not for us
2019-06-27T14:31:37  <jhernandez> stegru: in any case, I think that this line is more accurate https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/blob/GPII-3806.loginSolution/main.js#L55
2019-06-27T14:31:58  <stegru> yes, thought so
2019-06-27T14:32:09  <jhernandez> this is the branch that the last installer was built from
2019-06-27T14:32:28  <stegru> i did wonder why the line was off
2019-06-27T14:33:39  <stegru> ok, it looks like people are clicking the morphic (or reset) icon while morphic is loading
2019-06-27T14:33:48  <jhernandez> yup
2019-06-27T14:33:56  <stegru> they're eager to use it :)
2019-06-27T14:33:59  <jhernandez> haha
2019-06-27T14:34:33  <stegru> or they've renamed the desktop icon to something else ;)
2019-06-27T14:36:42  <stegru> btw jhernandez, I've changed that area of code in my metrics pull, so you'll get a conflict. do you think I should merge your branch into mine?
2019-06-27T14:38:06  <jhernandez> I'm not sure at this point what's the best strategy
2019-06-27T14:38:15  <jhernandez> I'd say, keep it updated with current master
2019-06-27T14:38:59  <jhernandez> because I'm going to start integrating from master branches
2019-06-27T14:39:05  <stegru> ok
2019-06-27T14:39:33  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-06-27T14:44:40  <stegru> you're right about the common term thing yesterday
2019-06-27T14:45:40  <stegru> or half right... it only works when first setting the preference, any updates don't work
2019-06-27T14:48:33  <javjarfer[m]> stegru,jhernandez  wow....
2019-06-27T14:48:46  <javjarfer[m]> I was in a call
2019-06-27T14:48:50  <javjarfer[m]> and you already solved this?
2019-06-27T14:49:06  <javjarfer[m]> so, it's a non-yet initialized thing?
2019-06-27T14:49:17  <stegru> user error
2019-06-27T14:49:44  <stegru> impatient to use morphic
2019-06-27T14:49:52  <javjarfer[m]> okay, I see it, we can just try-catch it, and display 'not-loaded yet'
2019-06-27T14:50:01  <javjarfer[m]> ðŸ˜†
2019-06-27T14:50:42  <stegru> well, the user interface isn't loaded at that point so you'll get another error trying to display that message :D
2019-06-27T14:51:28  <stegru> but it's happened 115 times since the 14th
2019-06-27T14:52:43  <jhernandez> stegru: I like the term "impatient user error"
2019-06-27T14:52:48  <jhernandez> xD
2019-06-27T14:53:03  <jhernandez> we should coin it
2019-06-27T14:53:06  <jhernandez> :P
2019-06-27T14:53:45  <jhernandez> and re the common term :/

2019-06-27T14:55:25  <stegru> if i add || true to the if expression, it works
2019-06-27T14:55:28  <stegru> Bosmon
2019-06-27T14:55:53  <stegru> in other words, if i make it think it's a common term

2019-06-27T14:56:47  <jhernandez> ok, so the PSP channel indeed receives the update from the qss but the it's the MM which is filtering this out?
2019-06-27T14:56:49  <stegru> but, the solution for this moment is to think of a common term that relates to the word ribbon

2019-06-27T14:57:41  <stegru> yes, psp is doing the right thing... the setting handler is getting the right value for the first time it's hit.. but for the next times it receives the same value as the first
2019-06-27T14:57:41  <Bosmon> cindyli - so it looks like the expectation here is that we are only prepared to support application terms which then go on to have a common term nested there?
2019-06-27T14:58:31  <Bosmon> We should really just make an explicit check for whether the term is composite, rather than the top level being common

2019-06-27T15:00:20  <Bosmon> That has no common term within it

2019-06-27T15:04:07  <cindyli> i think 1 is already supported: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/simon.json5#L19-L21
2019-06-27T15:04:13  <stegru> notice the unescaped .
2019-06-27T15:04:29  <Bosmon> It is probably supported, but it seems not as a result of updates over the PSP channel
2019-06-27T15:04:42  <stegru> yes, right
2019-06-27T15:04:50  <stegru> it's the updates that make it cry
2019-06-27T15:08:12  <cindyli> Bosmon, stegru: what does it mean by "updates over the PSP channel"? does it mean the input of 1 into the PSP channel in the core doesn't produce the expected output?
2019-06-27T15:08:47  <Bosmon> cindyli - right, an update of such a preference value doesn't produce the right output
2019-06-27T15:08:55  <cindyli> ok
2019-06-27T15:09:21  <cindyli> Bosmon: shall i create a jira and try to fix it now? how urgent is it?
2019-06-27T15:09:31  <cindyli> or NOVA should come first?
2019-06-27T15:09:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - this is more urgent
2019-06-27T15:09:57  <cindyli> ok. working on it
2019-06-27T15:10:05  <Bosmon> Since it affects the installer which is being built for Monday or so
2019-06-27T15:14:15  <javjarfer[m]> > but it's happened 115 times since the 14th
2019-06-27T15:14:16  <javjarfer[m]> woow that is a lot of time

2019-06-27T15:14:47  <javjarfer[m]> but then, stegru how is the error message "OOps something went wrong" pop up wen this errro happens
2019-06-27T15:15:26  <javjarfer[m]> Is that handled differently in any way?
