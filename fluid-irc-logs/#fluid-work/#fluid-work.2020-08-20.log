2020-08-20T10:18:19  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: I need to take Jira down for 10min to update it in order to fix an issue with the GitHub connector
2020-08-20T10:29:02  <gtirloni> done, jira is back
2020-08-20T10:32:13  <gtirloni> uh oh, GPII's JIRA cert has expired... and it uses HSTS so you can't bypass that. I've emailed Alfredo.

2020-08-20T16:13:38  <alanharnum> cherylhjli greatislander: this document has a great section on "fear of open conflict" as an oppressive practice, including an "antidotes" section about working against that: http://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/whitesupcul13.pdf
2020-08-20T16:14:02  <greatislander> hey I was just reading this a few weeks ago!
2020-08-20T16:14:07  <greatislander> thanks for sharing alanharnum
2020-08-20T16:33:56  <cherylhjli> wow alanharnum that's a great resource. I've seen the listicle version but this is definitely more in depth
2020-08-20T19:29:08  <Bosmon> alanharnum - that is indeed pretty interesting
2020-08-20T19:30:39  <Bosmon> Especially those of us at what seems like an endless series of training in being "conflict averse"
