2019-01-12T13:14:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I don't know of anyone using the starter grades from the prefs framework. We do have a lot of examples and tests that make use of them though, so there will be some clean up and changes to do throughout
2019-01-12T13:15:15  <Bosmon> I guess we won't really have time to do that review very soon
2019-01-12T13:15:31  <Bosmon> Perhaps we should have a meeting next week to assess the state of the various prefs framework options?
2019-01-12T13:16:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, sounds like a good idea.
2019-01-12T13:16:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have a time in mind?
2019-01-12T13:23:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the new JIRA for removing the grades. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6360
