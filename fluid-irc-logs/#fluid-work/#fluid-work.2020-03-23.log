2020-03-23T13:31:56  <batey96_> yes i do but thought it wise to first get more details from you.It wil help me better narrow the question

2020-03-23T13:34:49  <batey96_> the whole idea is based on multi version documentation..that is to say each tags(master,infusion x.x etc) have its own docs..but i got more confused when on the idea page it indicates that the documentation should reside ina different repository.
2020-03-23T13:35:49  <Justin_o> batey96_: have you checked out the existing infusion-docs repo and got it up and running locally?
2020-03-23T13:37:15  <batey96_> yes i have and i am currently working on how to submit a PR to support pretty urls for the project(assumig my proposal writing time doesnt beat me down).
2020-03-23T13:38:45  <Justin_o> batey96_: so you'll notice that the content and the static site generator bits are all mixed together in the same repo. What this project aims to do is to have the content in a separate repo from the parts needed for the static site generator. That way if we change between static site generators we don't have to modify the content at all
2020-03-23T13:40:35  <batey96_> ohh okay..am cleared..thanks for the pointer
2020-03-23T13:42:33  <batey96_> but it looks each Ssg has its own way of content structure
2020-03-23T13:44:02  <batey96_> havx a generic content structure that will work with any plugged in static site generator.shouldnt that be a blocking stone
2020-03-23T13:50:02  <Justin_o> batey96_: sorry, not sure if you were making a statement or asking a question

2020-03-23T19:02:26  <sunn-e> Thanks for replying. I will look forward to that.
2020-03-23T19:03:43  <Saad> Justin_o: Thank you for the feedback! I wanted to ask that you mentioned the saving preferences issue already exists. So should I add it in my proposal or not? I see it is still open and not been resolved.
2020-03-23T19:04:30  <Justin_o> you can add it if you like, but it is another that may end up getting addressed before you are able to address it as part of your GSoC project
2020-03-23T19:05:44  <Saad> If it gets addressed, won't it be a problem during the porting since new features are being added?
2020-03-23T19:06:43  <Justin_o> I'm not sure, but you would have to make sure you're staying in sync with the main repo. The project is still in active development.
2020-03-23T19:07:36  <Justin_o> I guess you are referring to saving to the user's google account. so yes, you'd have to be able to address different types of saving across extensions if that is the method used

2020-03-23T19:09:26  <Saad> Yes. I want to sync UIO+ settings with the user's google account so that wherever they log in and have UIO+ installed, they can get there required preferences with a single click.
2020-03-23T19:13:55  <Saad> Justin_o you mentioned that the new adaptions may need to be discussed with the community. I want to bring in a Screen Capture feature which will let the users to take the screenshot of the webpage and can then download it.
2020-03-23T19:16:20  *** dins <dins!af9dd296@175.157.210.150> has joined #fluid-work
2020-03-23T19:16:41  <Saad> All of the current implementations are either modifying the web page of interacting with it specifically like right click to select, text-to-speech. Keeping this in mind, I want to add the Screen Capture feature which will allow the user to capture the portion of the webpage they are viewing. What's your take on this?

2020-03-23T19:19:43  <Saad> Justin_o: This feature can have lots of benefits like if user wants to save news or something which is on the page for example the current stats of corona virus to compare them after a week.

2020-03-23T19:20:33  <Justin_o> Saad: honestly I don't see how that fits with UIO+ but I'm open for you to make a case for it. In regards to my comments about new adaptations being discussed with the community. You should probably allot time in your proposal for deciding which features specifically to implement.
2020-03-23T19:20:57  <Justin_o> Saad: I don't think it's a bad tool to have per se, I'm just not sure it fits with UIO+

2020-03-23T19:25:10  <Haider> the-t-in-rtf : You said me that phase 1 is just for selecting the potential technologies we'll use in the project. Does that means there's no coding in Phase 1? Is it really the project timeline, I am a bit confused about it.
2020-03-23T19:25:43  <Haider> the-t-in-rtf
2020-03-23T19:26:27  <Saad> I see your point Justin_o. I will try my best to make a case. If I couldn't, I will remove it from the proposal. Plus your reply "You should probably allot time in your proposal for deciding which features specifically to implement" cleared a lot things in my mind. So I should propose features in my proposal and after porting to Safari during the
2020-03-23T19:26:28  <Saad> GSoC, allot some time to discuss which proposed features we should proceed with. Right?
2020-03-23T19:27:31  <Justin_o> Saad: that sounds right
2020-03-23T19:27:54  <Saad> Awesome! Thank you for all the help Justin_o
2020-03-23T19:28:25  <Saad> Haider I think the-t-in-rtf is offline right now.
2020-03-23T19:29:35  <Haider> Hmmm, I guess so,  Saad
2020-03-23T19:31:41  <dmahajan980> @Haider as far as I know, Phase 1 won't be only about choosing the technologies. Choosing technologies would be a part of it along with the other things you'll be doing in the project.

2020-03-23T19:34:51  <dev-shubham1> Justin_o: what are the adaptations that needs to be added after porting the UIO+ chrome extension ?
2020-03-23T19:37:47  <Justin_o> dev-shubham1: you can suggest some. you'll also probably need to discuss specifics with the community before implementing. So leave room for that discussion in the project proposal

2020-03-23T20:08:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Phase one is a month long.
2020-03-23T20:09:04  <the-t-in-rtf> you would definitely not be evaluating technologie for that long
2020-03-23T20:09:23  <the-t-in-rtf> but you would be spending the first week, two if needed on that.
2020-03-23T20:10:12  <Haider> OK, I got it. Thanks the-t-in-rtf
2020-03-23T20:11:10  <the-t-in-rtf> To give you an example, when faced with similar requirements to select an appropriate technology, I typically take a day or two to research, write up, and then meet with my peers.
2020-03-23T20:11:28  <the-t-in-rtf> A week is a fair estimate.
2020-03-23T20:13:20  <Haider> Yep. I am also conducting some more research work.
