2020-07-20T13:58:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you be able to update your FLUID-6145 PR with master and publish a new dev release? Would like to get these changes ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1000 ) into the StoryTelling tool
2020-07-20T13:59:32  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, will do shortly
2020-07-20T13:59:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2020-07-20T15:41:37  <jhung> alanharnum the issue you were describing about asynchronous messages reminds me of an issue PhET was working through when I was on the project. Basically they needed a way to queue text updates, but also a way of determining whether or not the messages were 'stale'. The crux of the issue was that by the time the message was presented, the user could have performed another action that makes the update irrelevant.
2020-07-20T15:58:29  <alanharnum> jhung: yeah, we're dealing with a similar issue in a few areas, primarily because the research aspect wants to know when users take particular actions (like toggling preferences back and forth) and save that as a timestamped stream of events, but the UI  and other pieces only really need to care about the user's current state

2020-07-20T19:26:58  <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: i think the issue with starting the couchdb container as a service in github actions is mostly related to changes in the couchdb container itself: it refuses to start if you don't specify a username/password. take a look here: https://github.com/gtirloni/test-actions-with-services/runs/891342444?check_suite_focus=true
2020-07-20T19:27:45  <the-t-in-rtf> awesome, thanks!  That matches what I saw in testing that setup couchdb action
2020-07-20T19:27:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll give it a look tomorrow
2020-07-20T19:27:57  <gtirloni> nice
2020-07-20T19:38:02  <the-t-in-rtf> Just looked at the YAML, super helpful.
2020-07-20T19:38:05  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks again!
2020-07-20T19:38:08  <gtirloni> :)
2020-07-20T20:07:18  <gmoss> gtirloni: is your issue because you're using CouchDB 3.0+? They removed Admin Party mode in 3.0.0, iirc, but if you need a fix that doesn't involve configuring admin credentials, I've been skirting the issue in the Storytelling Tool by pinning to "apache/couchdb:2.3.1"
2020-07-20T20:07:37  <gmoss> (we'll want to solve this at some point, of course)
2020-07-20T20:07:39  <gtirloni> yeah, that's it
