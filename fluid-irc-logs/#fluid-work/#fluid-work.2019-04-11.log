2019-04-11T10:18:27  <jhernandez> stegru: hellcome back!
2019-04-11T10:18:38  <jhernandez> :)
2019-04-11T10:20:18  <stegru> hello jhernandez!
2019-04-11T10:20:29  <jhernandez> back in the north?
2019-04-11T10:21:09  <stegru> well, south - I went to scotland
2019-04-11T10:22:00  <jhernandez> hah
2019-04-11T10:23:11  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-04-11T10:23:36  <jhernandez> hope you enjoyed scotland
2019-04-11T10:23:50  <stegru> it was ok
2019-04-11T10:24:54  <stegru> glad to have my own toilet to sit on
2019-04-11T10:25:22  <jhernandez> heh, why that?
2019-04-11T10:25:41  <stegru> I don't know.. someone else's isn't as comfy
2019-04-11T10:26:14  <jhernandez> right
2019-04-11T10:46:50  <jhernandez> stegru: so, finally, we made the damned high contrast work in 1809
2019-04-11T10:47:30  <stegru> yes, it's not very good - not the fix, the reason for the fix
2019-04-11T10:47:54  <jhernandez> yeah, it's awful
2019-04-11T10:48:51  <jhernandez> I don't know what's the best thing to do here right now
2019-04-11T10:49:22  <stegru> I've just had an idea
2019-04-11T10:50:12  <stegru> we already use another process to get a localised list of language names - we could add another call into that process which also gets the theme names
2019-04-11T10:50:32  <jhernandez> but yeah, I guess that as part of the Nova's 1.1.0 post-mortem, you and javjarfer[m] already have ideas for upcoming stuff
2019-04-11T10:50:35  <stegru> this is performed when the qss start up
2019-04-11T10:50:48  <stegru> yeh
2019-04-11T10:50:52  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-04-11T10:51:25  <jhernandez> yes, but we need to get the localised names at any time
2019-04-11T10:53:05  <stegru> i mean, the names can be stored for when they're needed
2019-04-11T10:53:27  <jhernandez> the "fork" approach was "running late" (couldn't figure out why), that's why JJ made a c# script that we can call synchronously to get the localised name
2019-04-11T10:53:41  <jhernandez> stegru: hmm
2019-04-11T10:54:18  <jhernandez> you saying that you can get the loclised strings without switching language?
2019-04-11T10:55:40  <jhernandez> also, we figured out that our code works better when using our themes - so we added custom themes for the rest of high contrast themes
2019-04-11T10:56:30  <jhernandez> things become "ugly" when we deal with MS' themes
2019-04-11T10:56:40  <stegru> ok
2019-04-11T10:57:20  <stegru> I don't know why - I think the custom themes are uglier
2019-04-11T10:57:32  <stegru> unless, you mean having to deal with two types - yes
2019-04-11T10:59:02  <stegru> this gets called for every language installed: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/e35332c1731d120fa6b8199608883c6bf92c15c8/gpii/node_modules/gpii-localisation/src/language.js#L184
2019-04-11T10:59:06  <jhernandez> without JJ's c# sync thing (using the fork approach), the high contrast theme changes worked after a language switch, but we weren't setting the right theme
2019-04-11T10:59:44  <stegru> ok
2019-04-11T10:59:54  <jhernandez> yeah, JJ did exactly the same
2019-04-11T10:59:59  <stegru> yes, it's too late
2019-04-11T11:00:56  <stegru> anyway, that function gets called at the start-up (or if it thinks the list has changed) and gets the localised language names for the qss
2019-04-11T11:01:22  <stegru> the child process can also be modified to also get the localised names for the built-in themes
2019-04-11T11:01:55  <jhernandez> yes, and then retrieve them from a model or the like
2019-04-11T11:02:00  <stegru> yeh
2019-04-11T11:02:08  <stegru> javjarfer[m]
2019-04-11T11:02:32  <stegru> it's still ugly - but at least the ugliness is only getting invoked once
2019-04-11T11:02:36  <jhernandez> but we need to trigger things in windows with data coming from gpii-app
2019-04-11T11:03:16  <jhernandez> well, you know what I mean
2019-04-11T11:03:21  <stegru> yes
2019-04-11T11:04:01  <jhernandez> we might need to hold a model in gpii-app that can be shared with spiStettingsHandler or something
2019-04-11T11:06:05  <stegru> the model can be kept in gpii.windows.language
2019-04-11T11:06:15  <jhernandez> and then called from spi
2019-04-11T11:06:19  <stegru> yeh
2019-04-11T11:06:30  <jhernandez> yes
2019-04-11T11:08:21  <stegru> I can do that when I fix the way it gets the list of languages
2019-04-11T11:10:50  <jhernandez> sweet
2019-04-11T11:12:13  <jhernandez> I'm wondering that, in addition to the technical debt that we already know we have, if we meet Gregg and talk about next imminent steps/priorities
2019-04-11T11:13:27  <jhernandez> I guess that HIS priority right now is taking this last installer to the IT staff and wait for feedback
2019-04-11T11:13:40  <stegru> yeh
2019-04-11T11:18:11  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: yes, at least we have localized ugliness
2019-04-11T11:18:41  <javjarfer[m]> we need to debug why the promise from the configure block wasn't holding for next block to be executed
2019-04-11T11:19:18  <javjarfer[m]> and of course, after that we can have the same approach as for language, using a forked process, which is obviously much more cleaner than all of this

2019-04-11T13:23:43  <jhernandez> stegru: well, I'd say so
2019-04-11T13:24:32  <jhernandez> there are things that we or people are still experiencing, but not sure what should be tackled first
2019-04-11T13:25:13  <jhernandez> i.e.: gregg's having random "Remote procedure call" errors
2019-04-11T13:25:32  <jhernandez> but so far I think he's the only one experiencing that
2019-04-11T13:25:47  <jhernandez> not sure if it's caused by his copy of Windows
2019-04-11T13:26:07  <jhernandez> but when it happens to him, it's during a language switch
2019-04-11T13:26:28  <jhernandez> I've seen it happening on his pc during a live testing session
2019-04-11T13:27:57  <stegru> yes, I've added a comment about that - I think his vm is broken
2019-04-11T13:28:16  <jhernandez> but for example, I think this one is a "nice to" if we have time for it unless more people start experiencing it more often
2019-04-11T13:28:40  <jhernandez> yeah, that's my guess too, that his vm has something wrong
2019-04-11T13:29:11  <jhernandez> if you ask me, I'd say that sometimes Morphic doesn't get launched
2019-04-11T13:29:21  <jhernandez> and that we should take a look at that
2019-04-11T13:29:35  <jhernandez> or doesn't get launched, or the icon doesn't pop up
2019-04-11T13:30:51  <jhernandez> one thing is that sometimes, the service doesn't respond in a timely fashion (what Windows say in the logs)
2019-04-11T13:32:10  <jhernandez> which "makes sense" if Windows is taking too long to start
2019-04-11T13:33:01  <jhernandez> and that there are policies on Windows services that might help us to handle this kind of situations on slower machines
2019-04-11T13:34:00  <jhernandez> but if there are more problems beyond being running on a slow machine or a slow startup (due to windows updates or the like), can't tell
