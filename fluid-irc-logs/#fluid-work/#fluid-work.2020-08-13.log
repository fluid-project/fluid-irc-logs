2020-08-13T16:22:15  <gmoss> philip: I was just thinking about your version number question from your FLUID-6504 PR. is there a reason 2.0 is not desired? I'm in a similar position with a major update to the Storytelling Tool that I'm working on (SJRK-289), and it's going to bump us to 1.0.0.
2020-08-13T16:22:15  <gmoss> The reason I'm a little apprehensive about my situation is perhaps a feeling that it "doesn't deserve" a full number jump just yet since it's still in development and not many people are using it, but at the end of the day it's just a number, right? Chrome is at version 84 now, after all.
2020-08-13T16:26:26  <colinclark> it’s just a number, yes
2020-08-13T16:27:16  <colinclark> and i think it’s worth trying to communicate breaking changes to users if you’re a library or framework
2020-08-13T16:27:30  <colinclark> even if that means having a four digit major revision number :)
2020-08-13T16:27:47  <colinclark> in your case, gmoss, it’s slightly different in that you don’t provide an API for which you have clients or users
2020-08-13T16:28:03  <gmoss> colinclark: that's a fair point
2020-08-13T16:28:05  <colinclark> so you can afford to be a bit more flexible with the semantics
2020-08-13T16:28:25  <colinclark> but I agree with you—it’s just a number, and there’s nothing wrong with incrementing it
2020-08-13T16:28:29  <colinclark> if it communicates something useful
2020-08-13T16:31:11  <philip> gmoss: you summed up my feelings on the matter pretty perfectly
2020-08-13T16:36:47  <philip> gmoss: It feels like overkill to bump major version numbers when the API is still very unstable, i.e. there'll probably be several more breaking changes like this one before there are any real Nexus users
2020-08-13T17:00:14  <gmoss> philip: I can totally empathize with your sense of the major version bump being overkill.
2020-08-13T17:00:14  <gmoss> As part of my prep for the commit messages lightning talk, I was reading through the Conventional Commits site, and they suggest treating the project from the very beginning as if it has already been released. It means pretending for the first little while, but it might also be a good time to experiment with what the threshold is for a 'breaking' change while there aren't any "real" Nexus users.
2020-08-13T17:00:14  <gmoss> I've experienced instances of trying to trace through a git blame and hitting the first commit that says "initial commit" where 50% of the lines first appeared. This isn't quite the same issue, but my point is that early development can still affect the future ;P
2020-08-13T17:02:31  <philip> What room is design crit happening in?
2020-08-13T17:02:36  <gmoss> standup room
2020-08-13T17:02:39  <philip> Thanks
2020-08-13T17:02:41  <gmoss> :)
