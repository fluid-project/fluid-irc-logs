2018-11-22T15:54:03  <cindyli> hi jhernandez, to set up QSS in gpii-app vagrant VM, can I use the latest master branch of gpii/windows and gpii/gpii-app, rather than ajc3 branch?
2018-11-22T15:54:18  <jhernandez> cindyli: sure
2018-11-22T15:54:22  <jhernandez> you can use gpii-app master
2018-11-22T15:54:32  <jhernandez> is already using the latest of both universal and windows
2018-11-22T15:54:42  <jhernandez> ;)

2018-11-22T15:56:08  <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez. i'm getting this error at running "npm install" on gpii-app:
2018-11-22T15:56:09  <cindyli> ..\src\binding.cc(5): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'napi.h': No such file or directory [C:\vagrant\node

2018-11-22T15:56:13  <jhernandez> cindyli: btw, remove your node_modules
2018-11-22T15:56:14  <cindyli> does it look familiar to you?
2018-11-22T15:56:16  <jhernandez> heh
2018-11-22T15:56:27  <jhernandez> that's it
2018-11-22T15:56:31  <cindyli> yes, i did remove node_modules before npm install
2018-11-22T15:56:44  <jhernandez> remove your node_modules folder AND the package-lock.json
2018-11-22T15:56:50  <jhernandez> then
2018-11-22T15:56:52  <jhernandez> inside the vm
2018-11-22T15:57:00  <jhernandez> go to v:\
2018-11-22T15:57:07  <jhernandez> and run the npm install from there
2018-11-22T15:57:19  <cindyli> line gets cut on "go to v"
2018-11-22T15:57:37  <jhernandez> yeah, go to v:\
2018-11-22T15:57:41  <cindyli> v : \ vagrant?
2018-11-22T15:57:44  <jhernandez> nope
2018-11-22T15:57:51  <jhernandez> just v:\
2018-11-22T15:57:56  <jhernandez> the "drive"
2018-11-22T15:58:02  <jhernandez> cd v:\
2018-11-22T15:58:04  <cindyli> ok. v : \
2018-11-22T15:58:24  <cindyli> i only see "v" with a emoji
2018-11-22T15:58:27  <jhernandez> let me know if it works for you
2018-11-22T15:58:28  <jhernandez> oh
2018-11-22T15:58:34  <jhernandez> I see, sorry, didn't know that
2018-11-22T15:59:28  <cindyli> so, just go to v drive and run "npm install"
2018-11-22T15:59:31  <jhernandez> yup
2018-11-22T15:59:31  <cindyli> right?
2018-11-22T15:59:33  <cindyli> ok
2018-11-22T16:00:22  <jhernandez> cindyli: does it look better now?
2018-11-22T16:03:06  <cindyli> getting a different error. creating a paste
2018-11-22T16:04:25  <cindyli> jhernandez: failed at building node-gyp: https://pastebin.com/YGaDgiip
2018-11-22T16:04:53  <cindyli> this is to run "npm install" from v drive
2018-11-22T16:05:07  <cindyli> the previous error was when running "npm install" from c: \ vagrant
2018-11-22T16:05:21  <cindyli> both have package-lock.json and node_modules/ removed
2018-11-22T16:05:36  <jhernandez> oh
2018-11-22T16:05:37  <jhernandez> okay
2018-11-22T16:05:42  <jhernandez> I do know what's going on
2018-11-22T16:05:51  <cindyli> cool!
2018-11-22T16:06:00  <jhernandez> you are building on node 8
2018-11-22T16:06:06  <jhernandez> and you should be building on node 10
2018-11-22T16:06:08  <cindyli> ah ha
2018-11-22T16:06:22  <jhernandez> vagrant halt && vagrant provision should do the trick
2018-11-22T16:06:25  <jhernandez> sorry
2018-11-22T16:06:30  <cindyli> great
2018-11-22T16:06:37  <jhernandez> vagrant destroy -f && vagrant provision

2018-11-22T16:28:11  <jhernandez> wait
2018-11-22T16:28:16  <jhernandez> node 6.9.1?
2018-11-22T16:28:42  <cindyli> jhernandez: my Chocolatey.ps1 has this line
2018-11-22T16:28:46  <cindyli> $nodeVersion = "6.9.1"
2018-11-22T16:29:00  <jhernandez> hmmm
2018-11-22T16:29:05  <cindyli> how to get "Chocolatey.ps1" updated
2018-11-22T16:29:19  <cindyli> seems it's generated on the fly
2018-11-22T16:29:21  <jhernandez> which branch are you in?
2018-11-22T16:29:45  <jhernandez> let me check one thing
2018-11-22T16:30:03  <cindyli> master with a change on package.json that points to my windows branch
2018-11-22T16:30:17  <cindyli> both my windows and gpii-app are based on the master
2018-11-22T16:30:21  <cindyli> double checking..
2018-11-22T16:30:37  <Bosmon> cindyli - mine says $nodeVersion = "8.9.4"
2018-11-22T16:31:07  <Bosmon> But it's a good question why it doesn't say 10
2018-11-22T16:31:18  <jhernandez> and mine says $nodeVersion = "10.11.0"
2018-11-22T16:31:34  <Bosmon> Oh, I didn't realise it was autogenerated
2018-11-22T16:31:43  <jhernandez> I guess that after the last update yesterday you have to reprovision your vm
2018-11-22T16:31:48  <jhernandez> from gpii-app master
2018-11-22T16:31:58  <Bosmon> How on earth it is generated
2018-11-22T16:32:02  <jhernandez> I guess no, you have to
2018-11-22T16:32:14  <jhernandez> it's not generated, it's taken from windows/master
2018-11-22T16:32:23  <Bosmon> aha
2018-11-22T16:32:39  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Chocolatey.ps1#L18
2018-11-22T16:32:47  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I wonder how I ran your electron 3 tests then
2018-11-22T16:32:52  <Bosmon> Perhaps node 8.9 is still good enough
2018-11-22T16:33:19  <cindyli> i'm using wrong branch. sorry guys
2018-11-22T16:34:32  <jhernandez> Bosmon: good question, in theory yes, it should work
2018-11-22T16:34:35  <Bosmon> jhernandez, javjarfer[m], stegru - is it ok to move up our Windows meeting a bit and have it in about half an hour?
2018-11-22T16:34:44  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I think we have to say that, in practice, it does : P
2018-11-22T16:34:53  <Bosmon> I guess node 8.x is already nappy-compliant
2018-11-22T16:35:59  <jhernandez> cindyli: don't worry, probably I should have announced the electron 3 update and that you better reprovision your vm from gpii-app/master
2018-11-22T16:36:11  <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok to move up the windows meeting
2018-11-22T16:36:18  <stegru> that time would be inconvenient for me

2018-11-22T16:38:26  <Bosmon> stegru - doesn't 5.30 cut into teatime even worse? : P

2018-11-22T16:38:37  <jhernandez> xDDD
2018-11-22T16:38:48  <stegru> well, it did
2018-11-22T16:39:20  <jhernandez> I thought teatime doesn't take more than 30 mins
2018-11-22T16:39:27  <jhernandez> (unlike our spanish siesta)
2018-11-22T16:39:40  <jhernandez> :P
2018-11-22T16:39:42  <stegru> it depends on how greedy you are
2018-11-22T16:40:53  <jhernandez> does also depend on the amount of butter cookies ?
2018-11-22T16:42:28  <Bosmon> butter cookies....
2018-11-22T16:42:34  <Bosmon> jhernandez you are talking to a NORTHERNER

2018-11-22T16:44:17  <jhernandez> xD

2018-11-22T18:53:04  <cindyli> jhernandez: thanks for helping with setting up gpii-app vm. "vagrant provision" quits with this error: "npm ERR! Failed at the gpii-app@0.3.0 build script.". but running "npm install" inside VM passed so I ignored this error.
2018-11-22T18:53:20  <cindyli> however, i got this error at starting QSS by running "npm start" - https://pastebin.com/L6WEECLV
2018-11-22T18:53:25  <cindyli> does it look familiar to you?
2018-11-22T18:53:41  <cindyli> i'm using the gpii-app master branch

2018-11-22T19:10:35  <alanharnum> does anyone have any quick pointers, especially to prior art or documentation, about getting UIO to apply enactors to content that's in another iframe, rather than the main document?
2018-11-22T19:11:11  <alanharnum> ^ Justin_o cindyli jhung especially (I can dig into source code, but figured it was worth asking first, since we've probably encountered this before)
2018-11-22T19:15:38  <cindyli> alanharnum: is the iframe a part of the main content?
2018-11-22T19:16:02  <alanharnum> cindyli: yes, part of the main content, no same-origin concerns
2018-11-22T19:17:31  <cindyli> so, the desired result is to apply enactors to both main content and the content within the iframe?
2018-11-22T19:18:21  <cindyli> oh, your original question says "rather than the main document"
2018-11-22T19:18:24  <alanharnum> cindyli: yes - I'm particularly looking at the contrast enactor right now, since that's a very obvious one - I can get it to "work" by injecting the Enactor CSS into the iframe content and then manually applying the contrast theme classes via jQuery
2018-11-22T19:18:37  <alanharnum> sorry, that's bad wording - it should be "in addition to the main document"
2018-11-22T19:18:46  <cindyli> i see

2018-11-22T19:21:07  <cindyli> Justin_o would be more knowledgeable about the ways to do it with the latest prefs framework. with my knowledge, this requires injecting enactors, along with css, into the iframe
2018-11-22T19:21:21  <cindyli> the full page version of UIO is a good example - https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/fullPage/
2018-11-22T19:21:42  <alanharnum> ok, thanks cindyli - I think I can answer this all myself by digging into source a little, so if no one's memory is triggering of "yes, we had to do this on project <x>", I'll just keep tracing
2018-11-22T19:23:32  <alanharnum> digging down I think this is where I need to look: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/78e76b7a5efa4016c24dba92a77ed25787deffc4/src/framework/preferences/js/UIEnhancer.js#L107
2018-11-22T19:24:34  <alanharnum> and probably write some custom code that will select both the main body and the iframe content body
2018-11-22T19:31:51  <cindyli> alanharnum: i think in order to have 2 set of enactors, one for the main content, one for the iframe, to react synchronously to the UIO panel prefs change, you will need to inject the same uiEnhancer instance that's used by the main page into the iframe
2018-11-22T19:32:03  <cindyli> probably by using distributeOptions
2018-11-22T19:32:43  <cindyli> this is not a trivial work, i feel
2018-11-22T19:37:48  <alanharnum> cindyli: I'm not sure it needs to go down that road, provided we're dealing with same-origin content - it is possible to address iframe content directly with jQuery selectors, so (in theory) you could do this with an enactor / enhancer structure that doesn't limit itself to just the main document body.
2018-11-22T19:39:06  <alanharnum> Digging in further I can see that that fluid.prefs.enactor.classSwapper (used for contrast) currently swaps the classes in its own container, and is used in UIO by referencing the UIEnhancer container, which is set to the whole (main) 'body'.
2018-11-22T19:39:34  <cindyli> alanharnum: i could be wrong. what i'm thinking is, to have UIO panel, 2 UIEnhancers sync up, they will need to share model that has prefs info
2018-11-22T19:40:24  <alanharnum> cindyli: yeah, I think that could also work if I'm understanding what you're describing
2018-11-22T19:40:52  <cindyli> haha, sorry.
2018-11-22T19:41:08  <cindyli> you will have one UIO panel that users adjust preferences
2018-11-22T19:41:37  <cindyli> when one pref is adjusted, both main page and iframe content will react to this change
2018-11-22T19:42:34  <alanharnum> I'd basically want to try injecting the UIEhancer from the created UIO in the main document into the iframe, and do whatever else is necessary to maintain linkage between them?
2018-11-22T19:42:35  <cindyli> so, there will be 3 models in this case: UIO panel, UI enhancer hooked up with the main page body element, and UI enhancer for the iframe body element
2018-11-22T19:42:45  <cindyli> cool
2018-11-22T19:42:59  <cindyli> i think that's the right way to go
2018-11-22T19:43:17  <alanharnum> OK, I'll give that a try first, as it sounds like it would take less new code
2018-11-22T19:44:19  <cindyli> good luck
2018-11-22T19:45:20  <alanharnum> thanks cindyli!

2018-11-22T21:45:04  <Justin_o> gmoss: that's okay, but please let me know when it's up. Someone has requested to watch it.
2018-11-22T21:46:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: ah okay, that's great! I'll try to squeeze it in tonight before I head out of town, but I have the day off tomorrow so I won't be able to work on it then if I don't finish. Would Monday be too late?
2018-11-22T21:46:53  <Justin_o> I think it should be fine.. i'll just e-mail them tomorrow about it.

2018-11-22T21:53:48  <jhernandez> maybe you have to run the build script manually?

2018-11-22T21:54:22  <cindyli> will try it. thanks, jhernandez
