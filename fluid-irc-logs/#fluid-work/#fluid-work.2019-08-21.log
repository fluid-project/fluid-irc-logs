2019-08-21T12:48:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I'm running into some trouble with models and model relays in UIO+. I'm setting up the context menu (right click on the extension icon) to provide a menu for setting on/off prefs and adding a reset button. Do you know what usually causes this error?
2019-08-21T12:48:50  <Justin_o> Error in event handler: Error: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Error in model relay specification at component [object Object] - operated more than 100 relays without model value settling - current model contents are undefined
2019-08-21T13:13:29  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - yes, it is cause by having written a bad relay rule which doesn't invert properly
2019-08-21T13:13:42  <Bosmon3> Or a collection of relay rules which endlessly try to rewrite each others output

2019-08-21T13:16:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: hmm.. I'm guessing it's the latter, but not entirely sure. It doesn't happen all the time either.
2019-08-21T13:17:46  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - what do the relevant relays look like?
2019-08-21T13:20:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I seem to be able to get it to break in the current beta version, so you can try that out.. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek or use the latest master
2019-08-21T13:20:52  <Justin_o> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension
2019-08-21T13:21:18  <Justin_o> it isn't as easy to break there, but it can still happen from what I just tested.

2019-08-21T13:21:50  <Justin_o> I got it to break by clicking through the adjuster panels fast, in both directions, and changing the zoom fast as well. and then changing the panels again.
2019-08-21T13:22:23  <Justin_o> It's hard to tell when it is broken, but you'll eventually notice that the adjusters don't work anymore or that re-opening the panel opens to the wrong adjuster
2019-08-21T13:22:34  <Justin_o> if you use master you can see the error thrown on the background page
2019-08-21T13:22:48  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - best to look at the relay rules by eye first - also, do we have a useful console in the extension which gives us a better dump than [object Object]?
2019-08-21T13:22:55  <Justin_o> The relays are all those related to the prefs framework model
2019-08-21T13:23:00  <Bosmon3> I see
2019-08-21T13:23:01  <Justin_o> for settings and the panel index I guess
2019-08-21T13:23:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: unfortunately not, sometimes the model is undefined sometimes it has values in it, but they look okay

2019-08-21T13:25:04  <Justin_o> I'm stashing my in progress work and going back to master to test things out, to make sure we're on the same page. be one minute
2019-08-21T13:26:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: also there are three potential debuggers you may need for UIO+ 1) the background page 2) the browser_action (right click on the extension icon to see that) 3) the content scripts and injected scripts on the page using the standard debugger in the web page
2019-08-21T13:26:31  <Justin_o> I think for this case you'll probably only need the first and maybe second one.

2019-08-21T13:29:56  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - well, that's good : P
2019-08-21T13:30:10  <Bosmon3> It implies the problem might be in some new relay rules you have written?
2019-08-21T13:30:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I wonder if I'm having some caching issues with npm or something, I did blow away my node_modules before rebuilding, but I'm not sure that is reasonable.
2019-08-21T13:31:01  <Justin_o> or maybe caching with chrome for some code it's pulling for my extension
2019-08-21T13:33:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: okay, I've switched back to my dev work and got it to break again.
2019-08-21T13:34:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: here's the error this time, with a model, but still [object, object]
2019-08-21T13:34:11  <Justin_o> Error in event handler: Error: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Error in model relay specification at component [object Object] - operated more than 100 relays without model value settling - current model contents are
2019-08-21T13:34:11  <Justin_o> {"panelIndex":1,"settings":{"fontSize":0.25,"lineSpace":1,"wordSpace":1,"contrastTheme":"default","characterSpace":1,"selectionTheme":"default","captionsEnabled":false,"selfVoicingEnabled":false,"inputsLargerEnabled":false,"simplifiedUiEnabled":false,"clickToSelectEnabled":false,"syllabificationEnabled":false,"tableOfContentsEnabled":false}}
2019-08-21T13:35:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: the strange thing is that there isn't really a new model relay at the moment. There is a new component added to setup the context menu, but I've commented out the model binding portions
2019-08-21T13:37:42  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - my suspicion is that this might be something involving the panelIndex model field
2019-08-21T13:38:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: seems likely as I seem to get these errors when moving around the panel

2019-08-21T14:39:23  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - can't see it there either - should I do anything special?
2019-08-21T14:39:31  <Bosmon3> I'm zooming in and out and clicking up and down the panels rapidly
2019-08-21T14:39:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: did you go to one of the pages I mentioned above?
2019-08-21T14:41:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: would you like me to commit my current code to look at?
2019-08-21T14:42:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I think it's easier to see in mine because there are more relays setup.. maybe from the model listeners.. not sure
2019-08-21T14:42:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I think the issue is related to this https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/src/lib/domSettingsApplier.js#L48-L57
2019-08-21T14:43:25  <Justin_o> when a page has many iframes, and potentially this may also be related to the number of tabs or windows open, but I haven't tested that.
2019-08-21T14:44:20  <Justin_o> anyways, when there are many iframes, the content scripts get injected into all of them and they create connections via messaging, which probably ends up triggering a lot of model updates and relays.
2019-08-21T14:44:35  <Justin_o> which likely goes over the 100 limit
2019-08-21T14:44:41  <Justin_o> even though they may all be valid
2019-08-21T14:46:10  <Justin_o> I made a sample page with many iframes and ran it against my in progress code. I found that with 10 iframes or fewer it was working, but as soon as I went above that it would break on the first panel transition. On real sites its probably more random because of all the dynamic injection of iframes for the ads and analytics
2019-08-21T14:46:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: ^
2019-08-21T14:54:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I tried with the beta version of UIO+ on the chrome web store and it broke with 22 iframes

2019-08-21T17:03:27  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - Ok thanks, I managed to reproduce the issue with this branch
2019-08-21T17:04:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: thanks.. I'm adding in some more console logs.. I added one DataBinding.js from node_modules to see what the target it. The target is that is showing up as [object, object]. It's gpii.chrome.domSettingsApplier
2019-08-21T17:05:04  <Justin_o> which is the component that holds the ports

2019-08-21T18:24:49  <Justin_o> gmoss: maybe this would be a helpful example for the transformation. it's something I worked on a while back https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L68-L87
2019-08-21T18:25:15  <Justin_o> the extra config is sourced through the transformSpec
2019-08-21T18:25:57  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's very helpful, including setting up the inverse
2019-08-21T18:26:10  <gmoss> Justin_o: do you know where I could see some usage of this transform?
2019-08-21T18:26:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: never mind, found this in the docs https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#fluidtransformsnumbertostring
2019-08-21T18:28:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you also want to see a running example it's used by the textfield steppers in UIO
2019-08-21T18:28:30  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textfieldControl/js/Textfield.js#L118
2019-08-21T18:29:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: perfect. thanks!

2019-08-21T21:02:25  <Bosmon3> Hi there Justin_o
2019-08-21T21:02:38  <Bosmon3> So I've done a first pass of investigation at the relay issue
2019-08-21T21:03:02  <Bosmon3> To start with, I see that this CNN page generates 44 dynamic subcomponents, one for each "port" : P
2019-08-21T21:03:52  <Bosmon3> I believe that what is happening is that the system is getting overwhelmed by the number of models which are being put into bidirectional synchronisation by the definition                 model: "{domSettingsApplier}.model", on line 53 of domSettingsApplier.js
2019-08-21T21:04:38  <Bosmon3> Unfortunately this is currently done by a very inefficient algorithm that relays every change between each pair
2019-08-21T21:05:21  <Bosmon3> So what happens is that your sequence of updates on lines 119-121 wash up and down the collection of models until the system has had enough
2019-08-21T21:06:13  <Bosmon3> It's pretty interesting that the system doesn't seem to be so bad that the explosion of updates isn't quadratic, but must be some smallish linear factor, otherwise 44 linked models wouldn't have been coped with by raising the link count to 1000

2019-08-21T21:08:07  <Bosmon3> In any case, my best idea how to work around the problem right now is to replace your implicit relay definition on line 53 with an explicit unidirectional relay using fluid.transforms.identity
2019-08-21T21:08:14  <Bosmon3> I'll actually give this a try now and see what happens ....
2019-08-21T21:11:54  <Bosmon3> Well, wait.... the portConnector doesn't accept writes to the model as well, does it ....?
2019-08-21T21:14:41  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - ok, so the failure is gone - but unfortunately the extension doesn't seem capable of changing anything any more : P
2019-08-21T21:14:49  <Bosmon3> Perhaps there's something about the design I haven't grasped
2019-08-21T21:17:12  <Bosmon3> In any case - here's my gist for the suggested update - https://gist.github.com/amb26/3b23709e90de48a6b7675a05b615fb56
2019-08-21T21:17:16  <Bosmon3> See if it gives you any ideas
2019-08-21T21:19:07  <Bosmon3> I'll keep plugging away to see if I can find some kind of straightforward reason to stop the framework sloshing the updates up and down
2019-08-21T21:19:30  <Bosmon3> Unfortunately since you apply a DELETE and an full update within the same transaction it can't really reason that they aren't required
2019-08-21T21:20:27  <Bosmon3> But in the absence of anything else, I think that raising the link saturation count to 1000 isn't actually a terrible idea
2019-08-21T21:29:55  <Bosmon3> But Justin_o - something about this setup seems backwards to me.... one is there 1 DomSettingsApplier with 44 ports, rather than the other way round?
