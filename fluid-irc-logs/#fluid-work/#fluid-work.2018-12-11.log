2018-12-11T13:53:58  <javjarfer[m]> anything special on why you think UWP is the issue?
2018-12-11T13:57:24  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: no idea
2018-12-11T13:57:40  <jhernandez> at this moment I can't reproduce the issue 100% anymore
2018-12-11T13:58:12  <jhernandez> the vm was restarted and now I got into GPII-3558
2018-12-11T13:58:41  <jhernandez> I've just added some information
2018-12-11T13:58:42  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: have you experienced it even with stegru 's pull?

2018-12-11T14:00:01  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_jhe "yup"> okay, then we can conclude the failure should be elsewhere
2018-12-11T14:00:59  <jhernandez> yes
2018-12-11T14:01:34  <jhernandez> but, during my tests, it seems that this allocation https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/registrySettingsHandler/test/testRegistrySettingsHandler.js#L500 triggers the problem
2018-12-11T14:02:21  <javjarfer[m]> the allocation itself?
2018-12-11T14:02:28  <jhernandez> yeah
2018-12-11T14:03:10  <jhernandez> to me, the allocation itself shouldn't be a problem

2018-12-11T14:37:39  <Bosmon2> the-t-in-rtf - I notice our version of pouchdb in trunk is pretty stale, 6.4.3 compared to current 7.0.0

2018-12-11T17:23:19  <Bosmon> Awesome, thanks cindyli
2018-12-11T17:23:25  <jhernandez> I should get a survey when I first save settings, right?

2018-12-11T17:24:50  <jhernandez> yup, I just did that

2018-12-11T17:34:40  <jhernandez> why on hell is the contextManager doing such thing?
2018-12-11T17:36:41  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I think the message is just wrongly worded
2018-12-11T17:36:46  <Bosmon> cindyli added it in quite recently

2018-12-11T17:37:51  <cindyli> the line is probably added at the wrong spot because the next line in jhernandez's log says: Active contexts calculated to be: gpii-default

2018-12-11T19:21:48  <bryan_> I'm getting errors when running tests - unable to locate bindings file (ffi-napi)  https://pastebin.com/W5aqLvkz (relevant error) https://pastebin.com/cuh8JcGx (whole output)
2018-12-11T19:22:20  <bryan_> This is running inside the latest windows VM
2018-12-11T19:29:17  <Bosmon> Hey there bryan_ - thanks for pasting this
2018-12-11T19:29:46  <Bosmon> This is all pretty bizarre since the paths that you have done this from are shown as follows: C:\Users\byoun\projects\gpii\gpii-app
2018-12-11T19:29:52  <Bosmon> This path will not exist within the VM
2018-12-11T19:30:16  <Bosmon> Did you customise the VM in some way by setting up some kind of account, checking out some code, etc?
2018-12-11T19:30:23  <Bosmon> Otherwise, this looks like it is a path in your host VM
2018-12-11T19:30:30  <Bosmon> Either way, this is problematic : P
2018-12-11T19:33:56  <bryan_> That is a new VM, no modifications...but I did run the test locally to see if it worked there...maybe I copied from the wrong window
2018-12-11T19:35:33  <Bosmon> ok
2018-12-11T19:35:52  <Bosmon> If you ran it locally, the binaries would certainly fail
2018-12-11T19:36:20  <Bosmon> See if you can get the paste from inside the VM
2018-12-11T19:36:30  <Bosmon> You will need to enable the bidirectional clipboard in the VM's options menu
2018-12-11T19:36:32  <bryan_> I'm creating a new pastebin...same errors in both
2018-12-11T19:39:00  <bryan_> https://pastebin.com/b3tRtRvl
2018-12-11T19:39:31  <Bosmon> Cheers bryan_
2018-12-11T19:39:38  <Bosmon> Can you try doing the run from v:\ instead?
2018-12-11T19:39:49  <Bosmon> This is a network drive that automatically gets mounted inside the VM

2018-12-11T19:45:08  <bryan_> Hmmm...the system cannot find the drive specified
2018-12-11T19:45:14  <Bosmon> Ah
2018-12-11T19:45:21  <Bosmon> Well that's a suspicious sign
2018-12-11T19:46:06  <bryan_> Yeah maybe a virtual cable is unplugged lol
2018-12-11T19:46:15  <Bosmon> OK, so how did you get this VM started?
2018-12-11T19:46:19  *** avtar <avtar!~avtar@192-0-151-7.cpe.teksavvy.com> has joined #fluid-work
2018-12-11T19:47:09  <bryan_> Vagrant destroy, vagrant box update, vagrant up
2018-12-11T19:47:49  <bryan_> Let me restart it
2018-12-11T19:47:51  <bryan_> The vm
2018-12-11T19:49:08  <stegru> metrics kill switch is doable, Bosmon
2018-12-11T19:49:27  <bryan_> I have a feeling restarting it will clear out any cobwebs
2018-12-11T19:49:36  <Bosmon> bryan_ - ok - the fact that there is no V: drive is extremely puzzling
2018-12-11T19:49:46  <Bosmon> You didn't get any errors during the vagrant up process?
2018-12-11T19:49:52  <Bosmon> It can take an extremely long time
2018-12-11T19:50:47  <bryan_> No errors...it started up very quickly...<2 min and now I have access to the v: drive
2018-12-11T19:51:14  <Bosmon> bryan_ - ok great
2018-12-11T19:51:18  <bryan_> The test is running now, fingers crossed
2018-12-11T19:51:54  <Bosmon> vagrant up will only be very slow the very first time as it provisions the machine
2018-12-11T19:52:45  <stegru> you might want to take a snapshot of it, bryan_, so you don't need to do all this again
2018-12-11T19:52:56  <Bosmon> snapshot?
2018-12-11T19:53:05  <stegru> yes
2018-12-11T19:53:17  <stegru> host+t
2018-12-11T19:55:50  <bryan_> Thanks stegru I'll do that
2018-12-11T20:02:48  <Bosmon> bryan_ - test should be done by now I guess - did it pass?
2018-12-11T20:04:06  <bryan_> Just failed with the same error...unable to locate bindings
2018-12-11T20:05:13  <bryan_> Maybe I have to blow away node_modules and reinstall
2018-12-11T20:05:19  <bryan_> Let me try that
2018-12-11T20:05:23  <Bosmon> Sure
2018-12-11T20:05:37  <Bosmon> Also capture the output from npm install in the pastebin
2018-12-11T20:20:22  <Bosmon> bryan_ - how did it go?
2018-12-11T20:25:53  <bryan_> npm install looks like maybe 60% done...no errors so far
2018-12-11T20:26:31  <bryan_> I should have done --verbose though
2018-12-11T20:26:48  <Bosmon> 60% done!
2018-12-11T20:26:51  <Bosmon> In 20 minutes?
2018-12-11T20:26:56  <Bosmon> And I thought my machine was slow ....
2018-12-11T20:35:46  <bryan_> Could be the internet...I'm at lunch so I'm tethered to my phone
2018-12-11T20:37:14  <bryan_> I see some errors EBUSY: resource busy or locked
2018-12-11T20:37:29  <bryan_> I'll wait til it finishes and post the whole output
2018-12-11T20:37:34  <Bosmon> ok
2018-12-11T20:37:43  <Bosmon> Which dir did you run npm install from?

2018-12-11T20:49:21  <Bosmon> ok
2018-12-11T20:49:27  <Bosmon> EBUSY is worrisome
2018-12-11T20:52:29  <bryan_> It is stalling here https://pastebin.com/FiyyrH2S

2018-12-11T20:52:56  <Bosmon> That's pretty interesting
2018-12-11T20:53:06  <Bosmon> My first thought is that the npm package cache is corrupt somehow
2018-12-11T20:53:39  <Bosmon> But perhaps you just got a lot of broken transfers to the npm registry because of your tethering

2018-12-11T20:57:38  <bryan_> I'll be back home soon and I'll try it again on a better connection
2018-12-11T20:57:58  <Bosmon> As well as doing rm -rf node_modules in V: you should also blow away your npm cache
2018-12-11T20:58:06  <Bosmon> I'm just trying to find out where it is in the VM
2018-12-11T20:59:14  <Bosmon> Looks like it's in C:\Users\vagrant\AppData\Roaming\npm-cache
2018-12-11T20:59:34  <Bosmon> Destroy that completely too, and then do an npm install from V: on a good connection and see what happens
2018-12-11T20:59:53  <Bosmon> What versions of vagrant and virtualBox do you have installed?
2018-12-11T21:12:47  <bryan_> Vagrant 2.2.2, VirtualBox 5.2.22
2018-12-11T21:13:04  <Bosmon> Seems reasonable
2018-12-11T21:13:15  <bryan_> I'll try clearing the npm cache at home
2018-12-11T21:13:50  <Bosmon> My best guess is that you've just ended up with some corrupt tarballs from some broken transfers
2018-12-11T21:13:56  <Bosmon> But the EBUSY stuff is a bit baffling
2018-12-11T21:14:03  <Bosmon> Your outer OS is Windows 10 now, right?
2018-12-11T21:20:03  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - just a last bit of consolidation for https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/186 I think
2018-12-11T21:20:08  <bryan_> Yeah windows 10
2018-12-11T21:20:38  <bryan_> Maybe a full restart for good measure
2018-12-11T21:27:17  <stegru> EBUSY types of errors are sometimes related to anti-virus
2018-12-11T21:28:00  <stegru> (I think it's disabled in the vm)
