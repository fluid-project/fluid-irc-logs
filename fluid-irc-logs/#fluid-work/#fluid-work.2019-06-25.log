2019-06-25T04:50:04  <the-t-in-rtf> I am working on it, @sgithens, but unfortunately it's a lot deeper surgery than just updating a version.
2019-06-25T04:50:12  <the-t-in-rtf> the new gpii-json-schema is the big update
2019-06-25T04:50:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I stopped working on it when the universal performance problems came up.
2019-06-25T04:50:51  <the-t-in-rtf> it might require actually updating to use data loaders as well, which will add even more time.
2019-06-25T04:51:04  <the-t-in-rtf> the deduping of infusion seems really really odd though.
2019-06-25T04:51:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I would review at least that with Antranig, maybe there is something else going on there.

2019-06-25T09:30:16  <jhernandez> stegru: buenos dias
2019-06-25T09:30:55  <jhernandez> I've just created a pull request for the USB behavior, https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/788
2019-06-25T09:56:51  <stegru> ok jhernandez
2019-06-25T10:07:15  <stegru> so, jhernandez, after removing the second token and it keys out, the first token is still present
2019-06-25T10:07:36  <stegru> I wonder if that should be keyed in again?
2019-06-25T10:08:08  <stegru> I guess it's a question for UX
2019-06-25T10:08:45  <jhernandez> For USB: USB1 in –> key-in Prefs1; USB2 in –> key-out Prefs1, key-in Prefs2; USB2 out –> key-out Prefs2 (do NOT key-in Prefs1)
2019-06-25T10:08:48  <stegru> or maybe not ask them, because it would complicate things
2019-06-25T10:09:02  <stegru> ok ok
2019-06-25T10:09:05  <jhernandez> do NOT key-in Prefs1
2019-06-25T10:09:32  <stegru> ah yes, reading the specs is helpful
2019-06-25T10:10:26  <jhernandez> yeah, keying Prefs1 back in involves several things and yes, can complicate things a bit
2019-06-25T10:10:45  <stegru> and then there's this: "If a Key is read when GPII starts (with boot), then key-in happens."
2019-06-25T10:11:33  <jhernandez> I can try to see what happens, but I don't think is happening right now
2019-06-25T10:11:53  <stegru> well, I didn't implement that
2019-06-25T10:11:53  <jhernandez> (if I have a usb inserted when booting the computer)
2019-06-25T10:12:23  <jhernandez> I mean, we read for usb add events, right?
2019-06-25T10:12:43  <stegru> right
2019-06-25T10:12:50  <jhernandez> my gut feeling is that by when the gpii starts we've missed that event
2019-06-25T10:12:55  <jhernandez> (just guessing)
2019-06-25T10:13:00  <stegru> yes
2019-06-25T10:13:27  <stegru> especially if the usb key is inserted when the computer is off
2019-06-25T10:13:40  <jhernandez> yes
2019-06-25T10:14:55  <jhernandez> well, I can test that to ensure that we're not messing around with users
2019-06-25T10:15:33  <jhernandez> but I'd need to undust the vaio again - it'll start updating like crazy making the system unusable for an hour or so
2019-06-25T10:16:07  <jhernandez> not sure testing in parallels or vbox honors the use case
2019-06-25T10:16:11  <jhernandez> :P
2019-06-25T10:19:52  <jhernandez> ok, made linter happy

2019-06-25T17:43:31  <sgithens> cindyli: How's the credential migration script going? You're going to bump every schemaVersion in the repo to 0.2 for this right? I'm assuming that will be done before my GPII-2966 password field removal migration, so I'll plan on bumping everything to 0.3 for that
2019-06-25T17:43:59  <sgithens> I will include your migration as an example in the package though, so there is an example of 2 full migrations in the tests
2019-06-25T17:44:05  <sgithens> 0.1 -> 0.2 -> 0.3
2019-06-25T17:46:25  <cindyli> sgithens: i haven't started to write the migration script. working on GPII-3828 right now. but i will start on it pretty soon in the next a couple of days. yes, i will bump the schema version to 0.2. I will let you know when it's done so you can include it
2019-06-25T17:46:45  <sgithens> cindyli: awesome thanks
