2020-02-06T14:27:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: cindyli and I talked about some of the technical aspects and cindyli updated the JIRA with information about how to test.
2020-02-06T14:29:24  <Justin_o> So one question is, is this allowing UIO+ to set common terms values of just application specific values that will be stored.
2020-02-06T14:29:51  <Justin_o> I'm not entirely clear on the necessity for reading data from UIO+ so that might help answer the above and other questions I have.
2020-02-06T14:30:27  <Justin_o> the other issue is one of privacy. UIO+ requires a privacy statement which can be found here https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md
2020-02-06T14:32:54  <Justin_o> So any changes related to this issue and https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4242 would require an update to the Privacy Policy and should also provide a means for a user to opt in/out of the mechanism
2020-02-06T14:32:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think Gregg's increasing understanding is that apps would only set their own terms
2020-02-06T14:33:21  <Bosmon> If we want to enable future translation between common terms as applied to different apps this would occur at some other part of the system
2020-02-06T14:35:10  <javjarfer[m]> Hi, good afternoon everyone, Bosmon , cindyli
2020-02-06T14:35:23  <javjarfer[m]> I'm seeing a weird failure in the CI for my new pull for JAWS
2020-02-06T14:35:43  <javjarfer[m]> https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/2073/consoleText
2020-02-06T14:37:12  <javjarfer[m]> Looks like all the new additions to the solution are making the tests take too long, or something like that
2020-02-06T14:37:32  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the first failure I see is "12:24:55.613:  jq: Test concluded - Module "gpii.tests.multiScreenreader.config tests" Test name "Only one screenreader is launched": 18/19 passed - FAIL" ?
2020-02-06T14:38:00  <Bosmon> 2:24:55.004:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.multiScreenreader.config tests" Test name "Only one screenreader is launched" - Message: Checking that settings are set - at sequence position 18 of 30
2020-02-06T14:38:00  <Bosmon> 12:24:55.004:  jq: Expected: {
2020-02-06T14:38:00  <Bosmon>     "gpii.settingsHandlers.INISettingsHandler": {
2020-02-06T14:38:01  <Bosmon> etc
2020-02-06T14:39:43  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, I see it, can that failure make the rest of the tests to hang?
2020-02-06T14:40:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - there's no hang, just ordinary failures
2020-02-06T14:41:08  <Bosmon> For example: 2:26:15.106:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Error in settings handler mock configuration - handler gpii.settingsHandlers.JAWSSettingsHandler is not registered
2020-02-06T14:41:55  <javjarfer[m]> ```12:28:14.037:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.acceptance.windows.jaws.config tests" Test name "Testing preference set "jaws_application"" - Message: Error making request to /user/jaws_application/login: socket hang up```
2020-02-06T14:42:31  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, but the system has already failed
2020-02-06T14:42:40  <Bosmon> We really need to stop logging entire solutions to the console
2020-02-06T14:43:02  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I see I lack of the mock for that settingsHandler

2020-02-06T14:44:48  <javjarfer[m]> haha well, we need a "quiet" flag
2020-02-06T14:46:30  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I don't think we really need to log these "final" payloads fully, they have got a lot bigger since the days we used to think we wanted to see them

2020-02-06T15:57:22  <Bosmon> Justin_o - shouldn't it report settings made via its own UI back over its webSockets bus?
2020-02-06T15:58:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but why :)
2020-02-06T15:58:08  <Bosmon> !!!!
2020-02-06T15:58:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so to be clearer, I need to understand that clearly because we'll need to update the Privacy Policy that is used
2020-02-06T15:58:26  <Justin_o> by UO+
2020-02-06T15:58:27  <Justin_o> UIO+
2020-02-06T15:58:46  <Justin_o> right now at least, the connection to morphic is one way, so we don't share users data back
2020-02-06T15:59:03  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so that i) other UIs, such as the QSS could be responsive to their values, and ii) so that tools such as sgithens Capture Tool could snapshot their values
2020-02-06T15:59:10  <Justin_o> it seems, at least the way things are currently, that UIO+ is separate from Morphic, so sharing user data back would be like sharing with a 3rd party
2020-02-06T16:00:22  <Justin_o> we'll need to accompany any changes with some mechanism in UIO+ that informs users about this and allow them to opt in/out
2020-02-06T16:00:42  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sounds very odd, no other desktop app on their system does this : P
2020-02-06T16:01:40  <Justin_o> Chrome extensions now are required to have privacy policies and get reviewed based now. Part of the problem is that UIO+ needs to have a lot of access to make all of it's adaptations
2020-02-06T16:02:00  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok

2020-02-06T16:03:10  <colinclark> There’s a little part of me that thinks we should fork UIO+ into two
2020-02-06T16:03:18  <colinclark> even if that doesn’t involve a structural separation
2020-02-06T16:04:02  <colinclark> i.e. the one that is bi-directionally Morphic connected, which includes, well, a more profound impact on user data
2020-02-06T16:04:30  <colinclark> and regular old UIO+ which is more representative of the current reality of most peoples’ computers...
2020-02-06T16:04:36  <colinclark> i.e. they don’t have Morphic installed on them

2020-02-06T16:05:57  <colinclark> I mean, even if it’s not done in a modular way :)
2020-02-06T16:06:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I am guessing that what colinclark means is that the difference would just be enacted by some flag set in the extension's manifest
2020-02-06T16:06:29  <colinclark> yeah, or something simple
2020-02-06T16:06:54  <colinclark> My point is just that UIO+ actually gets a lot of interest, regardless of one’s interest in Morphic
2020-02-06T16:06:59  <colinclark> together they are great
2020-02-06T16:07:18  <colinclark> but UIO+ can still stand alone, and might have a little less intense privacy policy in the case where it does
2020-02-06T16:08:41  <Justin_o> In this case we'd be publishing two extensions 1) UIO+ which is what it is now but with the morphic connection removed 2) UIO+ with Morphic (need better name) that includes a bi-directional UIO+
2020-02-06T16:08:59  <Bosmon> "UIO+ for Morphic"? : P
2020-02-06T16:09:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that is an improvement over mine
2020-02-06T16:10:16  <colinclark> yes
2020-02-06T16:10:20  <colinclark> that’s exactly what I was thinking
2020-02-06T16:10:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: Another option would be to keep one extension but have an option to opt-into connecting to morphic. However, you'd have to have the same privacy policy.

2020-02-06T17:17:15  <colinclark> have you looked at just using either the linearScale or binaryOp transforms to do your negate?
2020-02-06T17:17:19  <colinclark> rather than writing one from scratch?
2020-02-06T17:17:55  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: good question. checking...
2020-02-06T17:19:28  <gmoss> colinclark: I hadn't considered linearScale! Justin_o and I did look into binaryOp and there wasn't support for a ! type operation (which isn't binary, though binaryOp has a lot of boolean operations)
2020-02-06T17:20:05  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: sorry, did I pasted a link to the test cases? it doesn't appear in my chat, I meant this ones https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/CloseConflictingAppsTests.js#L103
2020-02-06T17:20:17  <gmoss> After standup I chatted with michelled and cindyli, and we're going to try achieving the hiding/showing functionality by using just one model value to represent the visibility rather than coordinating two discrete values
2020-02-06T17:20:26  <colinclark> that seems reasonable
2020-02-06T17:20:39  <colinclark> should be able to use linearScale with a factor of -1
2020-02-06T17:20:50  <gmoss> colinclark: I was probably focusing too much on catering for cases that don't exist yet
2020-02-06T17:20:54  <colinclark> or binaryOp, multiplying by -1
2020-02-06T17:21:09  <colinclark> or subtracting with an offset of 0
2020-02-06T17:21:10  <colinclark> etc.
2020-02-06T17:21:26  <gmoss> colinclark: okay, I can try that out pretty quickly :) I'm still very entrenched in my strongly-typed Java roots, doing math things to boolean values is something I didn't consider
2020-02-06T17:21:45  <gmoss> true + true = 2, of cours
2020-02-06T17:21:46  <colinclark> I’d go with cindyli’s advice
2020-02-06T17:22:08  <colinclark> but there are options should you find yourself in a similar situation at some point in the future
2020-02-06T17:22:18  <gmoss> colinclark: okay, that's what I'll do then. we'll cross that bridge when we get to it :)
2020-02-06T17:28:05  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: checking the log from the matchmaking process before the failure occurs helps
2020-02-06T17:28:55  <cindyli> in the log you sent - https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/2073/consoleText, at 12:24:54.227, the prefs set  retrieved from the prefs server for "screenreader_common" seems right
2020-02-06T17:31:19  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I can pass you a reduced fail output
2020-02-06T17:31:39  <cindyli> the log of the matchmaking result after that is truncated so i cannot tell what the settings handlers received. what you can do is to run the failed test on your computer by setting fluid.logObjectRenderChars to a large number so you can check the matchmaking result and lifecycleInstructions sent to settings handlers. from there, you would be able to tell it's a matchmaking problem or settings handler problem
2020-02-06T17:32:33  <cindyli> run that single test only, it takes time to filter out log for th failed one
2020-02-06T17:32:39  <cindyli> th -> the
2020-02-06T17:34:03  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes, that's the one, but can't find "screendreader_common"
2020-02-06T17:34:45  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: at the line before 12:24:53.986:
2020-02-06T17:34:52  <cindyli> "search": "?key=%22screenreader_common%22&include_docs=true"
2020-02-06T17:36:02  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: the first failure is from this test - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/CloseConflictingAppsTests.js#L102-L155
2020-02-06T17:37:20  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes, exactly, but I thought that the "actual" value for "screenreader_common" was retrieved from other file, or was defined in other place
2020-02-06T17:37:50  <javjarfer[m]> but for your explanation, now I think it's the result of exercising this payload against the SR true?
2020-02-06T17:38:02  <cindyli> i think so
2020-02-06T17:39:02  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes, that's my issue, I can't see what the test "does"
2020-02-06T17:39:58  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: this test performs the full cycle of keying in "screenreader_common" although it uses mock settings handlers
2020-02-06T17:40:53  <cindyli> another place to check is to make sure the test uses the right Solution Registry you modified, javjarfer[m]
2020-02-06T17:41:23  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: interesting, how could they be using an outdated one?
2020-02-06T17:42:17  <cindyli> just to make sure, from my experience, some integration tests use linux solution registry or others, but this one should not as it's testing jaws
2020-02-06T17:42:52  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: interesting, yes, it should be working against windows one
2020-02-06T17:43:12  <cindyli> still make sure it's not using a SR sourced from test/ directory or unexpected elsewhere
2020-02-06T17:43:40  <javjarfer[m]> so... jaws works when exercising normal keying cycles, this may be related to the mocked settingshandlers?
2020-02-06T17:44:48  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I found it, don't know why my search didn't returned the "screenreader_common.json5" preference file, sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks!
2020-02-06T17:45:10  <cindyli> np. congrats!
2020-02-06T17:45:24  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I misspelled it twice during the search...
2020-02-06T17:45:35  <javjarfer[m]> brilliant of me
2020-02-06T17:45:36  <cindyli> i do that often too ;)
