2020-01-27T07:50:10  <Shubham> So I was going through the list of projects drafted for GSoC '20 and found 'Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid' as interesting. @the-t-in-rtf could you please guide me further about this?
2020-01-27T07:50:10  <Shubham> Thanks in advance

2020-01-27T14:19:43  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: good morning, are you in today?
2020-01-27T14:21:26  <cindyli> yes, javjarfer[m]

2020-01-27T14:24:48  <javjarfer[m]> hi there! I just wanted to ask you if you remember which is the config to work with the local web endpoint for testing preference sets
2020-01-27T14:25:23  <the-t-in-rtf> dunno
2020-01-27T14:25:28  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: has that endpoint being removed completely? I can remember that you told me there was a config for using it
2020-01-27T14:25:35  <the-t-in-rtf> if you mean manual testing, you can just use node ./gpii.js
2020-01-27T14:26:36  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: the showing/hiding of those endpoints are controlled by this config - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.config.suppressHttpEndpoints.base.json5
2020-01-27T14:28:43  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I see, I see my error now, thanks you
2020-01-27T14:29:19  <cindyli> anytime, javjarfer[m]
2020-01-27T14:29:53  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: wait, no... I still have this error "Unauthorized while executing HTTP GET on url"
2020-01-27T14:30:32  <javjarfer[m]> even if I'm using "gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.manualTesting"
2020-01-27T14:30:35  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: what endpoint are you using and how do you use it?
2020-01-27T14:30:50  <javjarfer[m]> the "login" endpoint
2020-01-27T14:32:03  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: you need to use "gpii.config.untrusted.production.dynamicDR", only config files for the production env have this special config included
2020-01-27T14:32:10  <cindyli> no, wrong
2020-01-27T14:32:21  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: *
2020-01-27T14:32:33  <cindyli> actually you are using the right one. dev configs have http endpoints exposed

2020-01-27T14:34:41  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: it's weird, the login endpoint appears not to be exposed
2020-01-27T14:35:13  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: did you start GPII from the command line?
2020-01-27T14:36:10  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli:  yes, this is the command I used: $env:GPII_TEST_COUCH_USE_EXTERNAL="TRUE"; $env:NODE_ENV="gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.manualTesting"; node .\gp
2020-01-27T14:36:10  <javjarfer[m]> ii.js
2020-01-27T14:37:03  <cindyli> great, at start, the console will have a bunch of output showing what server has been started with what endpoints attached, check it or copy/paste it and send to me
2020-01-27T14:37:13  <cindyli> i'm trying this command too

2020-01-27T14:38:57  <cindyli> login endpoints are exposed by local flow manager running on http://localhost:8081
2020-01-27T14:39:13  <cindyli> the cloud server is running on http://localhost:8084
2020-01-27T14:39:19  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes, for me also it says so https://pastebin.com/8g4t4ANh
2020-01-27T14:39:41  <cindyli> to use login you need to send a command such as: curl http://localhost:8081/user/carla/login

2020-01-27T14:44:45  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: found out. at least it works for me: stop GPII -> remove your couchdb docker container -> restart GPII
2020-01-27T14:45:25  <cindyli> very likely your local couchdb is also populated with wrong set of data, probably from running gpii tests
2020-01-27T14:45:38  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: oh, okay, great, I have couchdb local in windows, so... I'm going to nuke it
2020-01-27T14:45:47  <cindyli> ok. let me know

2020-01-27T14:47:58  <cindyli> cheers!
2020-01-27T14:50:36  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes! there is another thing I would like to ask you, because I think it could be a bug, can you think in anything why this transform could not be working? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/735/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R6189 . It was working back in the day, but now seems to be ignored
2020-01-27T14:52:04  <javjarfer[m]> It's very important for being able to smoothly closing the AT
2020-01-27T14:52:12  <javjarfer[m]> but looks like it's being filtered
2020-01-27T14:54:42  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: "being filtered" means the transformer ignores this transformation?
2020-01-27T14:55:34  <cindyli> do other transformation down below work fine such as "PRIMARY\\.magPower"? is this the only one being ignored?
2020-01-27T14:56:42  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I think so, haven't tried the other ones in the solution
2020-01-27T14:56:48  <javjarfer[m]> trying it
2020-01-27T14:56:52  <cindyli> thanks

2020-01-27T15:13:27  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli:  do you think it's possible that it's getting filtered because it's not in the preference set?
2020-01-27T15:14:28  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: which preference set are you using? there are a few modified prefs sets in your pull request
2020-01-27T15:15:42  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I'm using "zack.json5"
2020-01-27T15:17:36  <cindyli> ya, the setting needs to be in the prefs set, javjarfer[m]
2020-01-27T15:20:35  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: so, literalValue transforms doesn't work at all anymore?
2020-01-27T15:22:39  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: do you expect literalValue transforms to work even this setting is not included in the prefs set?
2020-01-27T15:24:06  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: there is no way to set a fixed value for a setting otherwise
2020-01-27T15:24:23  <javjarfer[m]> sometimes like in this case, is something we want to be able to do
2020-01-27T15:24:50  <cindyli> ok. let me check

2020-01-27T19:30:15  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: cool, in progress writing a reply to your zoomtext pull request… i figured out why that transformation is ignored. it was because your prefs set was under application term "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.aisquared.zoomtext". the "capabilitiesTransformations" only runs for terms either specified in "capabilities" array or input paths in transformations, which in your case are all "http://registry\\.gpii\\.ne
2020-01-27T19:30:15  <cindyli> t/common/magnification"
2020-01-27T19:30:33  <cindyli> in short, the transformation only runs for common terms
2020-01-27T19:30:44  <cindyli> if you'd like to have
