2018-11-30T11:10:16  <dandimitrov> Hi there Bosmon, stegru, jhernandez. I’d like to ask for your thoughts regarding something related to listing only installed languages
2018-11-30T11:10:25  <dandimitrov> Currently the GPII-3548 is with high priority but https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/220 (GPII-3544) is based on a gpii-windows version that is incompatible with Electron 1.8.8 on which our morphic-1.0.1 code is based
2018-11-30T11:10:42  <dandimitrov> stegru, how hard would it be to base your GPII-3544 work on a previous gpii-windows version that doesn’t include the changes for node 10?
2018-11-30T11:10:54  <dandimitrov> Currently we’re using gpii-windows version - 0.3.0-dev.20181120T145240Z.c46b4be
2018-11-30T11:11:03  <dandimitrov> I’m asking because I believe we should postpone full migration to Electron 3.x until GPII-3471(slowness caused by windowsMetrics) is fixed and we have fully tested our morphic-1.0.1 code with Electron 3. There might be some unexpected problems that haven’t been detected yet, so if the plan for 1.0.1 is to be released within a week or so, then I suppose it would be best if we used Electron 1.8.8 for it.
2018-11-30T11:15:47  <stegru> well, dandimitrov, I think it would be more efficient for me to fix the slowness
2018-11-30T11:21:54  <stegru> dandimitrov, i'll see what I can do about making it work for you, for now
2018-11-30T11:29:42  <dandimitrov> Great, stegru, thanks. Sandra was asking about that task and I believe they’d like to create the next release soon
2018-11-30T11:31:02  <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/windows/tree/GPII-3544%2B0.3.0-dev.20181120T145240Z.c46b4be
2018-11-30T11:31:08  <stegru> there you go, dandimitrov
2018-11-30T11:31:29  <stegru> stergru/windows#GPII-3544+0.3.0-dev.20181120T145240Z.c46b4be

2018-11-30T11:47:49  <Bosmon> Cheers, stegru - I've merged your main pull

2018-11-30T11:50:23  <the-t-in-rtf> are you talking about Frosted Flakes?
2018-11-30T11:50:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Imagine how much you'd hate them if your name was the same as the blasted tiger.
2018-11-30T11:52:52  <stegru> haha
2018-11-30T11:53:14  <the-t-in-rtf> It'd be like being named snap, crackle, or pop.

2018-11-30T14:48:50  <Bosmon> Please add any other outstanding pulls you are working on as well
2018-11-30T14:52:07  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon, thanks, was looking to the mails while you continued. Great to have the resume. I think I updated #611 with your suggestion
2018-11-30T14:52:11  <javjarfer[m]> Didn't I?

2018-11-30T17:20:56  <dandimitrov> cindyli, stegru: Do you know whether there are any restrictions in the possible values that the language setting can have? Should I be able to set it to a language such as "bg" (Bulgarian) because I'm having troubles with that?
2018-11-30T17:21:19  <dandimitrov> This is related to GPII-3548 - if we're displaying all installed languages it might include such values

2018-11-30T17:26:48  <stegru> grab what you like, jhernand_
2018-11-30T17:27:45  <stegru> looks like the tests are passing (gpii-app's failure is due to a windows fail that is now fixed)
2018-11-30T17:27:54  <stegru> dandimitrov, did you try: "bg-BG"?
2018-11-30T17:28:24  <dandimitrov> stegru: In a moment
2018-11-30T17:29:49  <jhernand_> dandimitrov: I guess that stegru's implementation already provides the right language codes, but in case you need to check it, here's the ms list of language packs (with codes) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/available-language-packs-for-windows
2018-11-30T17:30:14  <jhernand_> stegru: okay, grabbing now
2018-11-30T17:30:55  <jhernand_> do I need to do anything extra to use the tray button? or the default tray "thing" used by gpii-app?
2018-11-30T17:31:13  <jhernand_> *or is it already the default ...
2018-11-30T17:31:21  <stegru> you need to pour water on your head
2018-11-30T17:31:32  <jhernand_> how much?
2018-11-30T17:31:45  <stegru> just a cup will do
2018-11-30T17:32:20  <stegru> it's configured in the siteconfig.. currently both the button and icon are enabled
2018-11-30T17:34:28  <jhernand_> I see, great
2018-11-30T17:36:48  <dandimitrov> jhernand_, thanks. stegru, yep with bg-BG it works
2018-11-30T17:37:05  <stegru> good to know

2018-11-30T17:39:41  <dandimitrov> Looks like the codes that I’m using come from https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/220/files#diff-b8128a6dc487ee35bc314cb3433919d7R125
2018-11-30T17:41:55  <jhernand_> dandimitrov: and what are you getting from there? just "bg"?
2018-11-30T17:42:35  <dandimitrov> yes, this also applies for Russian. It is simply “ru”
2018-11-30T17:44:07  <jhernand_> stegru: hmm, not getting the region side?
2018-11-30T17:45:13  <dandimitrov> jhernand_: not exactly. For Spanish (Spain) I have the locale - it is es-ES

2018-11-30T18:03:03  <dandimitrov> we might work it around with something like: code = code + “_” + code.toUpperCase()
2018-11-30T18:03:10  <dandimitrov> if it is missing the regiion
2018-11-30T18:06:10  <jhernand_> dandimitrov: yeah, but for example, armenian is hy-AM
2018-11-30T18:12:03  <jhernand_> stegru: your tray button works GREAT!!!
2018-11-30T18:28:49  <jhernand_> stegru: wrt the language codes, there's this thing Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\MUI\UILanguages

2018-11-30T18:44:02  <jhernand_> and does it also show all the available languages with the region codes?

2018-11-30T21:24:41  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I'm still noticing a bit of whole-page jank when loading the inclusive cities site at https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/
2018-11-30T21:24:51  <Bosmon> This is on Chrome on Windows, I wonder if you can see it too
2018-11-30T21:25:03  <Bosmon> I can see it a little when the page is zoomed to 100% on the title
2018-11-30T21:25:13  <Bosmon> But if I zoom to 125% I see the entire page text jank
2018-11-30T21:25:31  <Bosmon> To me it looks like it is line spacing jank

2018-11-30T21:40:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I just tested it with Chrome on macOS. I notice the quote moving a bit on page load. I'm going to guess that it's related to the line-spacing and some interaction with that and UIO, but that's just a guess
2018-11-30T21:41:38  <Justin_o> Yes, i think it is. It seems that UIO is setting a line-height of 1.2 when it loads
2018-11-30T21:41:46  <Justin_o> which is probably why you are seeing things shift
2018-11-30T21:41:51  <Justin_o> i thought we looked at that before
2018-11-30T21:46:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6279?jql=text%20~%20%22line-height%20normal%22
2018-11-30T21:48:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: is the cities site using the latest infusion?
2018-11-30T21:49:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: from looking through the source code it appears to be using an older version
2018-11-30T21:51:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the version of infusion being used is from Nov 18, 2017 https://github.com/inclusive-design/website-cities/blob/master/static/js/lib/infusion/infusion-custom.js
2018-11-30T21:51:44  <Justin_o> I think they just need to update to the latest release and things should be good
2018-11-30T21:51:48  <Justin_o> or at least one would hope so
