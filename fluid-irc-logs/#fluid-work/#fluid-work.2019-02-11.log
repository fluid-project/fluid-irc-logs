2019-02-11T12:11:53  <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru good day!
2019-02-11T12:12:05  <stegru> hi
2019-02-11T12:12:14  <jhernandez> FYI, I've just reported https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3704
2019-02-11T12:13:18  <jhernandez> sorry for such a poorly report, but I couldn't gather more evidence than that
2019-02-11T12:16:40  <stegru> ok jh
2019-02-11T12:16:42  <stegru> jhernandez
2019-02-11T12:17:38  <jhernandez> stegru: also, I'm about to report another one
2019-02-11T12:17:42  <stegru> both times the computer went to sleep?
2019-02-11T12:18:12  <jhernandez> which is about the trayButton disappearing from the toolbar, although you can still key-in/out - so I guess it's a problem with the trayButton itself
2019-02-11T12:18:31  <stegru> yes, probably
2019-02-11T12:20:49  <jhernandez> stegru: the first time it happened to me I'm pretty sure that the computer stayed up overnight - but maybe macOs decided to have a power nap, dunno. In the morning I just moved the mouse around and it popped up really fast, so I assume it didn't go to sleep
2019-02-11T12:21:05  * jhernandez shrugs
2019-02-11T12:21:21  <stegru> ok
2019-02-11T12:22:45  <jhernandez> re the missing trayButton - shall I go ahead and report it?
2019-02-11T12:22:49  <stegru> yes
2019-02-11T12:36:28  <jhernandez> stegru: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3705

2019-02-11T13:41:59  <Bosmon> jhernandez - hi there!
2019-02-11T13:42:20  <Bosmon> I was wondering whether we need to talk about whether stegru 's Windows Service work raises any issues for you in building the installer?
2019-02-11T13:43:03  <stegru> not really, changes have been made in the build script for it
2019-02-11T13:44:01  <jhernandez> Bosmon: stegru I would be happy to give it a try if there is a "GO" from stegru
2019-02-11T13:44:55  <jhernandez> stegru: I guess that you're still finishing the last touches - shall I wait or just "ship it"?
2019-02-11T13:45:00  <stegru> ah, I didn't make a PR for the installer
2019-02-11T13:45:24  <stegru> I tihnk it's done, but i need to double check before you waste time on it
2019-02-11T13:45:45  <Bosmon> I'll also give it a little spin
2019-02-11T13:48:22  <jhernandez> stegru: okay - even without the bits for the installer ... is it in shape for us to pull and test? Shall we have a small meeting later so you can show to us how all this fit together?
2019-02-11T13:48:28  <stegru> jhernandez, https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/58
2019-02-11T13:48:38  <stegru> yes yes
2019-02-11T13:49:40  <jhernandez> oh, okay, I see that it was just a matter of updating your wix-installer bbranch, greeat

2019-02-11T14:53:10  <stegru> jhernandez, is the latest installer from 1st feb? if so, I can't reproduce the high-contrast theme bgu
2019-02-11T14:54:58  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, last one is from Feb 1st
2019-02-11T14:56:22  <jhernandez> which one are you trying to reproduce?
2019-02-11T14:57:05  <stegru> the one where some themes don't work - like, brown
2019-02-11T14:57:45  <stegru> oh ffs, i might need to update windows - sorry
2019-02-11T14:57:51  <jhernandez> the one that Kavya show us last Friday, right?
2019-02-11T14:57:56  <stegru> yess
2019-02-11T14:58:10  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-02-11T14:58:25  <jhernandez> that's a weird one
2019-02-11T15:38:08  <Bosmon> stegru - so I'm just trying to puzzle over what we would indeed write to the user's folder if we wanted to actually turn this into some kind of moderately secure authentication scheme
2019-02-11T15:38:36  <Bosmon> I'm guessing it will have to be some hash of the user's ID signed by a secret held by the server
2019-02-11T15:38:56  <stegru> yes.. something like that
2019-02-11T15:39:13  <Bosmon> But then there still remains the issue of how that ever gets there in the first place
2019-02-11T15:39:13  <stegru> or, something like an oauth token that gets renewed
2019-02-11T15:39:18  <stegru> yep
2019-02-11T15:40:16  <Bosmon> They could go through some kind of signup process and then receive an email with a code in it, but they then still need to go through some kind of UX of putting it somewhere
2019-02-11T15:40:39  <stegru> if it's just the user's ID signed by the server.. then there's no point in having it in a file where it can be copied
2019-02-11T15:41:05  <Bosmon> stegru - it's still better than having it in plaintext and allowing them to impersonate any user they like :)
2019-02-11T15:41:20  <stegru> well, yes
2019-02-11T15:41:36  <stegru> but anyway, this auto-login is just the ground work for the real windows-based login
2019-02-11T15:41:45  <Bosmon> If they "lose" the file through having it copied etc. it is just their own funeral
2019-02-11T15:41:48  <Bosmon> Rather than everyone's
2019-02-11T15:41:57  <stegru> yes
2019-02-11T15:42:05  <Bosmon> But the real windows-based login requires SPNEGO or similar, right?
2019-02-11T15:42:25  <Bosmon> And we've got no confidence that that will generally be deployed or available
2019-02-11T15:42:40  <stegru> i meant, the windows user id thing that we've invented
2019-02-11T15:42:58  <Bosmon> Wot thing have we invented?
2019-02-11T15:43:15  <stegru> the thing we've been talking about these past 5 months
2019-02-11T15:43:28  <stegru> hash(user id + secret)
2019-02-11T15:43:36  <Bosmon> Oh, that thing
2019-02-11T15:43:49  <Bosmon> I don't believe Gregg+Sandra are seeing it that way
2019-02-11T15:43:59  <Bosmon> I believe they are considering it as a fully effective authentication scheme in its own right
2019-02-11T15:44:09  <Bosmon> Which we have from time to time mentioned that it could be
2019-02-11T15:44:49  <Bosmon> And wouldn't these two schemes store the file in different places?
2019-02-11T15:45:04  <Bosmon> The "windows user id" thing needs to store a machine secret in a place where the user can't read it
2019-02-11T15:45:13  <Bosmon> Whereas this one stores a per-user secret in a place where the user *can* read it
2019-02-11T15:45:18  <stegru> "the file"? with the user/secrect hash there is no file
2019-02-11T15:45:32  <stegru> oh i see
2019-02-11T15:45:49  <stegru> these files are two different files..
2019-02-11T15:45:58  <Bosmon> They are, indeed, two very different files
2019-02-11T15:46:45  <stegru> What I mean is, currently there is a "get user key" function, which reads a file.. that function can be repleaced with one that gets the signed user id
2019-02-11T15:47:18  <Bosmon> Could be, yes
2019-02-11T15:47:38  <stegru> that's what I mean by the groundwork is done.. my branch keys in with "something" on startup
2019-02-11T15:50:20  <stegru> but yes, it is currently no good
2019-02-11T15:51:24  <Bosmon> That's ok
2019-02-11T15:51:32  <Bosmon> Let's try and get some specs on how this feature is actually meant to work
2019-02-11T15:51:36  <stegru> yep
2019-02-11T15:52:24  <stegru> but, you say that anyone can impersonate anyone with that file.. you're right, but if the key is a guid.. it can't be guessed
2019-02-11T15:52:46  <stegru> not practically, anyway
2019-02-11T15:52:55  <Bosmon> It would only be a guid if someone had already allocated it
2019-02-11T15:53:04  <Bosmon> For which I currently see no provision
2019-02-11T15:53:44  <stegru> can't we allocate on the fly?
2019-02-11T15:54:21  <stegru> the client pulls one out of the air
2019-02-11T15:54:35  <Bosmon> i) there is currently no code for provisioning a fresh preference safe from the client end, ii) allowing this in an unrestricted way opens us up to trivial DoS attacks
2019-02-11T15:54:57  <stegru> yes, right
2019-02-11T15:55:58  <Bosmon> We're only prepared to allow our "crappy" route to provision new tokens based on the existence of the machine secret
2019-02-11T15:56:02  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2019-02-11T15:56:07  <Bosmon> Which would then make this work dependent on that work
2019-02-11T15:56:20  <stegru> yes

2019-02-11T16:41:49  <stegru> ok
2019-02-11T16:42:30  <jhernandez> how do I make gpii-app to run the service?
2019-02-11T16:43:25  <jhernandez> are you that fancy that it's already running and I didn't figure out? :P
2019-02-11T16:43:46  <stegru> ha!
2019-02-11T16:43:49  <jhernandez> I mean, gpii-app uses a kettle conf that includes the universal config
2019-02-11T16:43:54  <jhernandez> so .....
2019-02-11T16:44:10  <stegru> well, I should have made a PR for gpii-app

2019-02-11T16:44:24  <jhernandez> I see
2019-02-11T16:44:26  <jhernandez> :)
2019-02-11T16:48:30  <stegru> hmm, I thought I added an instruction for npm - give me a moment, and i'll have something ready
2019-02-11T16:50:24  <stegru> well, for now you can start it from gpii-windows/service, there's a README.md that will explain
2019-02-11T16:51:40  <stegru> npm run service-install,   npm run service-start,  npm run service-stop,  npm run service-uninstall
2019-02-11T16:53:31  <stegru> jhernandez, this is the PR https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/89 - you'll only need it now if you want to build the installer
2019-02-11T16:53:49  <jhernandez> okay okay, yes, I saw the README file
2019-02-11T16:57:33  <jhernandez> and yeah, thanks for the PR, I was only missing the bits that build the service
2019-02-11T16:58:33  <jhernandez> but ... shouldn't that be part of the windows "npm install" step?
2019-02-11T16:59:35  <stegru> well, it is also part of that
2019-02-11T16:59:56  <stegru> "npm install" in windows does build the service
2019-02-11T17:00:32  <stegru> but in gpii-app, it builds the service in a different way for the installer
2019-02-11T17:01:03  <jhernandez> ok, got it

2019-02-11T19:37:03  <cindyli> Bosmon: i'm working on GPII-3117 again to remove the environment reporter and some of the context manager. my list to remove:
2019-02-11T19:37:17  <cindyli> 1. the environment report every 20 seconds;
2019-02-11T19:37:34  <cindyli> 2. PUT /environmentChanged endpoint: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ContextManager.md#reporting-changes-in-environment-put-environmentchanged
2019-02-11T19:38:46  <cindyli> 3. stop to support conditions defined in prefs sets such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/condTest.json5#L35-L39, which is to remove the functionality described here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ContextManager.md#supported-condition-transformations
