2020-01-09T14:35:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you think I should be writing a typedef for the auxiliary schema and primary schema. and if so, what's the best way to capture all of the properties that are undetermined because they are keyed off of the preference name
2020-01-09T14:35:51  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think writing a typedef for it would be pretty tough
2020-01-09T14:36:36  <Bosmon> Well, for the whole thing
2020-01-09T14:36:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that's what I'm experiencing
2020-01-09T14:36:49  <Bosmon> You can write a typedef at the lower levels of containment
2020-01-09T14:37:01  <Bosmon> Here is the stackoverflow guide I am finding: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56225401/dynamic-keys-in-jsdoc-typedef
2020-01-09T14:37:26  <Bosmon> Well
2020-01-09T14:37:29  <Bosmon> Lack of guide : P

2020-01-09T14:43:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you say lower levels of containment, you mean for example the thing that configures a preferences. It would have panel, and enactor properties
2020-01-09T14:43:45  <Justin_o> and write a type def for that?
2020-01-09T14:43:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2020-01-09T14:44:09  <Bosmon> It would help at least to write typedefs for the levels of the structure which are regular

2020-01-09T14:46:31  <Justin_o> okay, I'll give it a go thanks
2020-01-09T14:46:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: what about the primary schema.. that one is based on jsonschema should I still document that or is it enough that we mentioned it
2020-01-09T14:47:08  <Justin_o> also I can't remember where version of json schema we are using
2020-01-09T14:47:17  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: ^ maybe you recall
2020-01-09T14:58:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you made updates to Infusion recently to make sure that we were in line with the latest version of json schema
2020-01-09T15:00:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, remember.. I wasn't sure if we did some customizations or borrowed from an alternate version of the spec
2020-01-09T15:00:24  <Justin_o> or maybe we just talked about things that didn't make it into the spec

2020-01-09T15:11:49  <the-t-in-rtf1> The current gpii-schema uses draft 7
2020-01-09T15:12:19  <the-t-in-rtf1> we have our own variant of that schema which is transformed to draftv7 for actual validation
2020-01-09T15:12:41  <the-t-in-rtf1> Anything in the 2.0 line should not vary in that respect
2020-01-09T15:14:43  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: thanks for the details on that
2020-01-09T15:14:49  <the-t-in-rtf1> This should still be accurate
2020-01-09T15:14:49  <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-json-schema/blob/master/docs/gss.md
2020-01-09T15:15:06  <the-t-in-rtf1> i.e. you're writing in a language we support and not the very similar raw draft v7
2020-01-09T15:15:12  <the-t-in-rtf1> that page covers the small differences
2020-01-09T15:15:41  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: thanks for the link, I'll just link to that document in my comment
2020-01-09T15:15:58  <the-t-in-rtf1> So, @Bosmon and @jhernandez, Kavya is seeing unique errors about a closed pipe when using Morphic to connect to my dev cloud.
2020-01-09T15:16:16  <the-t-in-rtf1> I cannot reproduce things at all in a. VM and could use help understanding how to proceed (pastie in a moment)
2020-01-09T15:16:31  <the-t-in-rtf1> https://pastebin.com/ATh0j5Vm
2020-01-09T15:16:45  <the-t-in-rtf1> it looks like the local flow manager dies mid-request
2020-01-09T15:16:54  <the-t-in-rtf1> but there are no useful details
2020-01-09T15:17:08  <the-t-in-rtf1> I was hoping you might have seen something like this before or otherwise have suggestions
2020-01-09T15:17:22  <the-t-in-rtf1> failing that, I was hoping to get you in a meeting early tomorrow
2020-01-09T15:24:45  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - I've never seen anything like that
2020-01-09T15:24:54  <Bosmon> It looks like an issue for stegru, who has created all our pipes : P
2020-01-09T15:26:30  <the-t-in-rtf1> it's frankly bizarre, as it doesn't happen in a Windows VM, but only on Kavya and Janne's machines.
2020-01-09T15:26:54  <stegru> that error can be ignored.. it just means you don't have the service running
2020-01-09T15:26:54  <the-t-in-rtf1> I have no means of troubleshooting this, but we honestly need to understand it before we can proceed with the deployment.
2020-01-09T15:27:01  <stegru> the pipe error, that is

2020-01-09T15:27:19  <the-t-in-rtf1> is there anything upstream to explain why the service isn't running then?
2020-01-09T15:27:27  <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, this occurs as part of a restart, but the icon never shows up
2020-01-09T15:28:09  <stegru> oh - this is a deployment
2020-01-09T15:28:26  <stegru> well, the service should start morphic
2020-01-09T15:29:51  <stegru> c:\programdata\morphic\ contains a log for the service
2020-01-09T15:31:13  <stegru> wait no.. this *was* started by the service (maybe i should read the log downwards)
2020-01-09T15:31:36  <stegru> and it looks like the user was logging out
2020-01-09T15:31:51  <Bosmon> The shutdown requested by the service is interesting - 08:52:37.938:  Service: request{
