2020-10-05T13:33:40  <Justin_o> gtirloni: for the current fluid logs, is it possible to have the most recent logs show up at the top instead of the bottom
2020-10-05T13:41:00  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I don't see a sort option in the config
2020-10-05T13:41:38  <Justin_o> gtirloni: :( okay no worries.. maybe if we update the logs site in the future we will be able to address this.
2020-10-05T13:42:13  <Justin_o> gtirloni: hmm.. any change that it may be related to the sorting order of the directory the logs are in, and not the server config
2020-10-05T13:48:02  <Justin_o> cindyli: when do you think you'll have time to continue our pair code review?
2020-10-05T13:49:18  <cindyli> Justin_o: do you have time this afternoon/
2020-10-05T13:49:40  <Justin_o> cindyli: I should yes.. until about 4:30
2020-10-05T13:50:17  <gtirloni> Justin_o: the server directory is generated on the fly by the bot.. it has a built-in web server
2020-10-05T13:50:26  <cindyli> Justin_o: i'm available anytime this afternoon. what about 1-2PM?
2020-10-05T13:50:40  <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah okay, thanks
2020-10-05T13:50:49  <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds good
2020-10-05T13:50:58  <cindyli> great
2020-10-05T14:02:29  <Justin_o> cindyli: looking at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1010#discussion_r498496265 what CSS does the wecount site use for specifying the hyphens and word breaks
2020-10-05T14:12:25  <cindyli> Justin_o: wecount doesn't use css to specify hyphens. soft hyphens are added directly as part of the content. for example, to hyphenate the word "development", it was written as "develop&shy;ment"
2020-10-05T14:19:53  <Justin_o> cindyli: and do you leave the hyphens as auto? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens
2020-10-05T14:23:23  <cindyli> Justin_o: wecount doesn't define the "hyphens" attribute, so it uses whatever the default value that the browser picks
2020-10-05T14:24:10  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2020-10-05T14:24:15  <cindyli> np
2020-10-05T14:43:04  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I'm reviewing https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1011  Would you mind to send a message out to the fluid-work list about us switching off of Node 10.x and the reasons why. That way others will be notified to update their development machines if need be.
2020-10-05T14:59:33  <gtirloni> Justin_o: sure! will do
2020-10-05T15:01:48  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-10-05T15:02:27  <Justin_o> gtirloni: merged
2020-10-05T15:02:50  <gtirloni> thank you!
2020-10-05T15:12:46  <gtirloni> Bosmon: I'm also glad there were no issues enabling node 14.x :) I still remember the 0.10/0.12/4.0 days, haha not fun
2020-10-05T15:13:01  <Bosmon> node is so boring these days : P
2020-10-05T15:13:05  <Bosmon> That has upsides and downsides :)
2020-10-05T15:14:16  <gtirloni> lol
2020-10-05T15:34:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: how do we want to handle the no-redeclare for the fluid_3_0_0 namespace. We can either not declare it in the eslintrc file, or we can add ignores to all the files
2020-10-05T15:35:03  <Justin_o> I think the former is better, but let me know if you think otherwise
2020-10-05T15:35:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine if we don't declare it in the eslintrc file, we will get a different error
2020-10-05T15:35:40  <Bosmon> Have you tried it out?
2020-10-05T15:36:00  <Bosmon> If it works, I'm fully in favour of it : P
2020-10-05T15:37:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'll try it out now
2020-10-05T15:39:00  <Bosmon> eslintrc *ought* then to complain that fluid_3_0_0 is used before it is defined, but perhaps it is not smart enough to
