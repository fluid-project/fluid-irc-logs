2018-09-28T08:52:57  <georgitodorov> Hey, Bosmon, jhernandez! Any news regarding the strange test failing behavior that we observed yesterday?

2018-09-28T09:52:11  <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov - I've written up the problem at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3409 and I think cindy could be able to look at it when she gets in
2018-09-28T09:52:36  <Bosmon> Unfortunately I will be out during the daytime here but will be able to help out during her afternoon
2018-09-28T09:53:11  <Bosmon> The good news is that her "reset" functionality pull is pretty much ready so if you have a moment you could experiment integrating with it to see if it raises any issues at your end
2018-09-28T09:53:35  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/675
2018-09-28T09:55:33  <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, I will take a look. I guess we can use our fork of `gpii-windows` and make its universal refer to Cindy's pull?
2018-09-28T09:55:37  <georgitodorov> Will that work?
2018-09-28T09:55:42  <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, should do
2018-09-28T09:55:53  <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Great, thank you
2018-09-28T10:29:19  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: hey there - re your question about GPII-3302, the wix-installer side is ready but not merged yet. Yesterday I updated it with the morphic branding (which is already merged)
2018-09-28T10:33:05  <jhernandez> if you want to test it, you can use this pr (https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/41) and then by manually pointing to javihernandez/gpii-wix-installer/GPII-3302 in provisioning/Installer.ps1

2018-09-28T13:10:52  <georgitodorov> I see that there is this "defaultSettings.json5" which resides in "%gpii-universal/testData/solutions"
2018-09-28T13:11:29  <georgitodorov> What should I write in this file so that I can control the default values of the QSS settings (e.g. the DPIScale or the language settings)?
2018-09-28T13:12:00  <georgitodorov> Also, is the work on snapshotting the settings of interest to the PSP/QSS done in a separate branch?

2018-09-28T13:24:48  <cindyli> for each settings, the trick is to set the desired value to settingsHandlers.config.settings.[setting].value

2018-09-28T13:34:29  <georgitodorov> I edited the snippet that you sent to me to include only the DPI scale and put the file in "%gpii-universal/testData/solutions" folder
2018-09-28T13:35:15  <georgitodorov> I change the "Read Aloud" setting and hit the "Reset All" button (which I have now changed to make a request to /login for the "reset" token)

2018-09-28T14:25:46  <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone actually tried using NVDA lately?  I only don't see any preference sets in gpii-universal that do anything beyond launching it.
2018-09-28T14:26:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we only exercise them by setting generic terms?
2018-09-28T14:26:24  <jhernandez__> stegru: okay, thanks! will try to test the filebeat thing later
2018-09-28T14:27:26  <jhernandez__> the-t-in-rtf: yes, couple of months ago IIRC
2018-09-28T14:27:47  <jhernandez__> it's the same situation with JAWS
2018-09-28T14:27:52  <jhernandez__> we need to update the version
2018-09-28T14:27:53  <the-t-in-rtf> well, it WAS.
2018-09-28T14:27:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I have tested that extensively
2018-09-28T14:28:00  <jhernandez__> right
2018-09-28T14:28:03  <the-t-in-rtf> and updated the version in my pull.
2018-09-28T14:28:16  <the-t-in-rtf> happy to do the same for NVDA, just making sure there wasn't useful prior art or anyone else working there.

2018-09-28T14:28:43  <jhernandez__> and we need to check that it actually works, specially after having reworked the iniSettingsHandler
2018-09-28T14:28:57  <the-t-in-rtf> NVDA should be a gentle breeze by comparison, there's a chocolatey package for it and everything.
2018-09-28T14:29:11  <the-t-in-rtf> and it won't restart the VM every 40 minutes.
2018-09-28T14:29:19  <jhernandez__> exactly
2018-09-28T14:29:42  <jhernandez__> it's a matter of taking the time to test with last versions of both nvda and the gpii
2018-09-28T14:30:04  <jhernandez__> and I don't think that javjarfer[m] or stegru are actually working on it
2018-09-28T14:30:07  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, blowing away my JAWS testing rig and converting that to test NVDA
2018-09-28T14:30:17  <the-t-in-rtf> I hope not, as I just met with JJ and agreed to do it.
2018-09-28T14:30:19  <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2018-09-28T14:30:28  <stegru> I'm not
2018-09-28T14:30:55  <the-t-in-rtf> Great, keep on not working on it, and we're good.
2018-09-28T14:31:44  <jhernandez__> but if you are looking for something to onboard and that it's a "nice to have", probably you could try taking over this one (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/606) - if Antranig thinks it's worth
2018-09-28T14:32:10  <jhernandez__> I don't see him around at this moment though
2018-09-28T14:32:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll probably start with NVDA, as we have a bunch of data that will let me populate most of the settings in a very short amount of time.
2018-09-28T14:33:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I would have to learn a lot about the PSP to get that far.
2018-09-28T14:34:02  <jhernandez__> the-t-in-rtf: I don't think so, AFAIK right now it only follows the language setting, but not sure about the priority of it
2018-09-28T14:34:22  <jhernandez__> but I'd say it's a "nice to have" if possible
2018-09-28T14:34:45  <jhernandez__> just saying :)
2018-09-28T14:35:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll keep it open for Monday and subscribe to it.

2018-09-28T16:03:03  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli, dandimitrov - how are things standing with the "reset" implementation?
2018-09-28T16:03:13  <Bosmon> Does it look like it integrates well with the app?
2018-09-28T16:03:24  <cindyli> yes, it works well
2018-09-28T16:03:50  <cindyli> the problem georgi had was caused by a wrong defaultSettings.json5 in the setting dir
2018-09-28T16:03:59  <cindyli> removing it fixed the problem
2018-09-28T16:04:52  <cindyli> Bosmon: thanks for your comments on the "reset" pull request. all addressed. ready for another look
2018-09-28T16:05:18  <cindyli> one sec, CI failed
2018-09-28T16:07:52  <cindyli> from journal test, might be related to GPII-3396
2018-09-28T16:08:30  <jhernandez__> stegru: FYI, I've been playing around with the App/Text Zoom and chrome and it works great

2018-09-28T16:17:57  <jhernandez__> dandimitrov, cindyli: I've just reported https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3415
2018-09-28T16:18:34  <jhernandez__> let me know if it's already in your radar or whether we need to take a closer look at it
2018-09-28T16:19:46  <cindyli> jhernandez__: it's not, but i probably know why. snapset_2a uses application specific preferences rather than the top level common term. QSS only recognize the top level common term
2018-09-28T16:20:00  <jhernandez__> ahá
2018-09-28T16:20:18  <jhernandez__> interesting
2018-09-28T16:20:38  <cindyli> if the highcontrast prefs in snapset_2a are changed to

2018-09-28T16:20:53  <cindyli> things should work
