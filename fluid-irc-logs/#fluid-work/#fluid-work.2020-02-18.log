2020-02-18T14:14:40  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - re the use of "/enabled" preferences
2020-02-18T14:14:53  <Bosmon> There was definitely a decision made, but I am not finding a single JIRA that encodes this
2020-02-18T14:15:00  <Bosmon> But, for example, this JIRA is clearly from the "old" era: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2685
2020-02-18T14:15:41  <Bosmon> Whereas this one is from the new era: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3204
2020-02-18T14:16:07  <Bosmon> Hmm, GPII-3204 is probably still "old"
2020-02-18T14:18:34  <Bosmon> This is "new" :https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3753
2020-02-18T14:19:28  <Bosmon> Ah here we go: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3435
2020-02-18T14:19:42  <Bosmon> From cindyli: "Do I miss anything? If not, I will start implementing the handling of "/enabled" preferences in this branch. The preference above should produce a "lifecycleInstructions" like:"
2020-02-18T14:21:06  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will standardise the outliers in flat.json5
2020-02-18T14:24:50  *** cindyli <cindyli!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-czcxakbxdjxjtmwc> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-18T14:25:03  <Bosmon> Morning, cindyli!
2020-02-18T14:25:11  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf and I were just reminding ourselves about https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3435
2020-02-18T14:25:57  <cindyli> Bosmon: any problem with it?
2020-02-18T14:26:20  <cindyli> catching up your conversation...
2020-02-18T14:26:31  <the-t-in-rtf> No, just evidence that some common terms were never updated
2020-02-18T14:26:39  <Bosmon> cindyli - not really a problem as such, we were just reminding ourselves how/when we decided to move over to the "/enabled" form of preference
2020-02-18T14:26:45  <Bosmon> Since there never seemed to be a dedicated JIRA about it
2020-02-18T14:26:55  <the-t-in-rtf> or some transforms that refer to them
2020-02-18T14:31:21  <cindyli> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: the test for using "/enabled" with defaultSettings.json5 - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/shared/ResetDefaultSettingsTestDefs.js#L38
2020-02-18T14:31:26  <cindyli> looking into the source code...
2020-02-18T14:33:29  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L205
2020-02-18T14:33:37  <the-t-in-rtf> That's an example of one that needs to be updated
2020-02-18T14:34:07  <the-t-in-rtf> it may be the only living example
2020-02-18T14:34:17  <the-t-in-rtf> the rest are zombies still referred to from transforms
2020-02-18T14:35:06  <cindyli> "debounceEnable" is not defined in the win32.json5
2020-02-18T14:35:15  <cindyli> and it's not using /enabled term
2020-02-18T14:35:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, because it's a common term
2020-02-18T14:35:30  <the-t-in-rtf> and your example used a common term with /enabled
2020-02-18T14:35:55  <cindyli> right
2020-02-18T14:36:06  <the-t-in-rtf> the question is, why isn't it using /enabled?  Because someone forgot?
2020-02-18T14:36:11  <the-t-in-rtf> seems like it
2020-02-18T14:36:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, look at this?
2020-02-18T14:36:32  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6357
2020-02-18T14:36:41  <the-t-in-rtf> the transform points to the /enabled variant
2020-02-18T14:36:49  <the-t-in-rtf> we have to fix one side of things
2020-02-18T14:36:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm voting for fixing the term itself
2020-02-18T14:41:48  <cindyli> "/debounceEnable" was added 2 years ago by Bosmon for GPII-2556 - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/549/files#diff-d4ee43b21b85bf07d0e584bd09c02350R274
2020-02-18T14:42:19  <cindyli> i doubt if anyone can still remember the intention of it
2020-02-18T14:42:43  <Bosmon> hahahaha
2020-02-18T14:43:22  <the-t-in-rtf> whoever wrote the transform was confused by the convention, so unless there's a reason not to, I'm fixing the entry in flat.json5
2020-02-18T14:43:56  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @Justin_o, now that you're here, I'm trying to clean up the UIO+ settings
2020-02-18T14:44:10  <the-t-in-rtf> your transforms expect there to be a wordSpace common term, and there isn't
2020-02-18T14:44:12  <Bosmon> God knows how all this material got into this pull
2020-02-18T14:44:20  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@CPE0011329d5706-CMbc3e0737d1c0.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-18T14:44:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume that's still a working feature and that I should try to recover that common term
2020-02-18T14:44:47  <Bosmon> I have a feeling that this pull was bassed on some old work of sgithens
2020-02-18T14:45:08  <Bosmon> Since the original flat.json5 might have been incorporated from his initial schematisation
2020-02-18T14:45:11  *** sepidehshahi <sepidehshahi!~sepidehsh@CPEe0553d68e035-CM64777d56f120.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-18T14:45:34  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: all of those should correspond to features in UIO+ except I have a PR to remove the captions setting from UIO+ https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/838
2020-02-18T14:46:02  <the-t-in-rtf> Another question about your fontSize setting
2020-02-18T14:46:03  <Bosmon> Looks like jhernandez contributed the original contents of that file which I suspect he got from sgithens
2020-02-18T14:46:12  <the-t-in-rtf> you divide the common term by 12
2020-02-18T14:46:32  <the-t-in-rtf> which results in a setting of 1 with the default
2020-02-18T14:46:43  <the-t-in-rtf> but the schema starts at 3.
2020-02-18T14:46:59  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L12596
2020-02-18T14:47:15  <the-t-in-rtf> So the default from the common terms results in invalid data when run through your transform
2020-02-18T14:47:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I need to know which to fix
2020-02-18T14:47:23  <the-t-in-rtf> the schema or the transform
2020-02-18T14:51:22  <Justin_o> the schema should reflect the values post transform?
2020-02-18T14:51:26  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2020-02-18T14:51:56  <Justin_o> that is, the value space of the solution as opposed to the common term

2020-02-18T14:52:11  <the-t-in-rtf> yes!
2020-02-18T14:52:26  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if I store it under your namespace, it follows your rules
2020-02-18T14:52:31  <the-t-in-rtf> the common term has its own rules
2020-02-18T14:52:46  <the-t-in-rtf> and UIO+ has its own rules
2020-02-18T14:53:07  <the-t-in-rtf> so, I'm already there and can fix it if the schema is wrong
2020-02-18T14:53:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I just need to know max/min/any restrictions on what it has to be a multiple of
2020-02-18T14:54:57  <Justin_o> okay, so the schema sounds wrong in this case... should be from 0.25 to 5
2020-02-18T14:55:00  <Justin_o> with default being 1
2020-02-18T14:55:43  <the-t-in-rtf> does it have to be a multiple of 0.25 or anything?
2020-02-18T14:57:07  <Justin_o> the UI steps in increments of 0.1 but you could enter values in increments of 0.01
2020-02-18T14:57:31  <the-t-in-rtf> hmmm
2020-02-18T14:57:38  <Justin_o> it's based off of chrome's magnification/zoom which you can set as percentage values
2020-02-18T14:57:46  <the-t-in-rtf> so I guess only 0.2 is reachable via the UI?
2020-02-18T14:58:08  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, 0.3
2020-02-18T14:58:31  <Justin_o> 0.2 is never reachable because the minimum is 0.25
2020-02-18T14:58:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I'd rather slightly constrain the space and keep it closer to the UI, so that whatever Steve Githens creates is reasonable
2020-02-18T14:58:47  <the-t-in-rtf> right
2020-02-18T14:58:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I meant 0.3
2020-02-18T14:59:16  <the-t-in-rtf> if we claim a minimum of 0.3 and a multipleOf of 0.1, that's much cleaner
2020-02-18T14:59:23  <Justin_o> well it can be entered using the +/- steppers which move in increments of 0.1 until it reaches an extreme then it will go to the closest valid value..
2020-02-18T14:59:28  <the-t-in-rtf> even though we give up on that 0.05 of extra room on one end
2020-02-18T14:59:30  <Justin_o> there's also a text field to enter the values in
2020-02-18T14:59:35  <Justin_o> which you could put in whatever you want
2020-02-18T14:59:44  <the-t-in-rtf> can you type in 0.25?
2020-02-18T14:59:48  <the-t-in-rtf> ah
2020-02-18T14:59:49  <Justin_o> and you could also use keyboard shortcuts of the chrome zoom ui itself
2020-02-18T15:00:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I think I'll leave the multipleOf out then
2020-02-18T15:00:07  <the-t-in-rtf> that's only an artifact of your UI
2020-02-18T15:00:30  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. we just need to represent the range of values, which is an integer from 0.25 to 5
2020-02-18T15:00:35  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, a number!
2020-02-18T15:00:38  <the-t-in-rtf> not an integer
2020-02-18T15:01:02  <Justin_o> yes, but we will just round anything beyond 2 decimal points..
2020-02-18T15:01:37  <Justin_o> 0.259 will become 0.26
2020-02-18T15:03:09  <the-t-in-rtf> if you're doing that anyway, I'd leave the multiple out
2020-02-18T15:03:18  <Justin_o> okay
2020-02-18T15:03:20  <the-t-in-rtf> the transform stays simple
2020-02-18T15:03:36  <Justin_o> I see
2020-02-18T15:04:09  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: the transform is doing a round already https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L12754
2020-02-18T15:04:13  <Justin_o> but it might also be wrong ;(
2020-02-18T15:04:26  <the-t-in-rtf> be of good cheer
2020-02-18T15:04:35  <the-t-in-rtf> it will be right by the time I'm done with it
2020-02-18T15:04:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I was just waiting for. you to return from the day off
2020-02-18T15:05:19  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks :)
2020-02-18T15:06:18  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  this scale should be 2 https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L12755 based on our early conversation, or removed if we don't want to restrict the multipleOf
2020-02-18T15:06:37  <Justin_o> or rather that the number of decimals in an acceptable value
2020-02-18T15:07:03  <Justin_o> removed, meaning the whole fluid.transforms.round transformation
2020-02-18T15:07:39  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I'd prefer that
2020-02-18T15:09:00  <the-t-in-rtf> so, we still have a problem

2020-02-18T15:09:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I was doing the maths twice
2020-02-18T15:09:20  <the-t-in-rtf> let me just double-check the range on the common term, though
2020-02-18T15:09:48  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L236
2020-02-18T15:10:15  <the-t-in-rtf> so, the minimum divided by twelve is 0.1 / 12, or 0.0083
2020-02-18T15:10:23  <the-t-in-rtf> we still need to address that somehow
2020-02-18T15:10:33  <the-t-in-rtf> no rounding will fix that for us
2020-02-18T15:11:35  <the-t-in-rtf> we may end up with a lossy pair of transforms, i.e. we might have to just nudge up anything from the transform that's below 3.
2020-02-18T15:11:42  <the-t-in-rtf> 3/12 = 0.25
2020-02-18T15:13:37  <the-t-in-rtf> we could also just agree that we're not letting people go below 3pt fonts
2020-02-18T15:13:49  <the-t-in-rtf> which I am totally fine with

2020-02-18T15:16:32  <Justin_o> yes, I think so, in practice for UIO (not the extension) we set the minimum to 0.5
2020-02-18T15:16:43  <Justin_o> which would likely be 6px or 8px depending on the base font
2020-02-18T15:17:36  <Justin_o> in UIO the fontSize is enacted by changing the root font size, in the extension (UIO+) we change the browser zoom

2020-02-18T19:41:21  <the-t-in-rtf> actually, all told it's only one setting that needed to be changed
2020-02-18T19:41:47  <the-t-in-rtf> there were a bunch of zombies from another solution with that pattern, but Boz and I agreed to dispose of them
2020-02-18T19:42:13  <sgithens> cindyli: I was just about to update my gpii-app capture code to master universal, but I just noticed that we've removed the utility methods for inferring common settings from application specific settings. I was in the progress of using those to hopefully also save common settings based on the system capture of application settings.
2020-02-18T19:42:20  <sgithens> Is there another way to do this now?
2020-02-18T19:42:25  <sgithens> or a preferred way
2020-02-18T19:43:07  <the-t-in-rtf> (very interested in hearing the answer)
2020-02-18T19:48:17  <cindyli> sgithens: this function will transform app settings to common terms - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L650-L651. it requires "inverseCapabilitiesTransformations" to be defined in the win32.json5 for any special handlings
2020-02-18T19:49:54  <sgithens> cindyli: Thanks, will take a look at it now
2020-02-18T19:50:11  <cindyli> hope it helps

2020-02-18T20:55:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, cindyli and I are looking at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4218
2020-02-18T20:55:53  <Justin_o> should it be something that is kept up to date with UIO+ changes constantly, or something that just sends a request to UIO+ for its current settings.
2020-02-18T20:56:41  <Justin_o> Also if you are just capturing this on startup, the browser may not be open, so it wouldn't be able to connect to UIO+ to get the settings

2020-02-18T21:13:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the websockets bus is intended to keep this live
2020-02-18T21:13:54  <Bosmon> I'm not sure what you mean by "the browser"
2020-02-18T21:14:01  <Bosmon> Isn't the browser the thing that hosts UIO+?
2020-02-18T21:14:34  <Justin_o> Yes, so if chrome isn't launched/open when you try to perform a read, you won't be able to get anything back
2020-02-18T21:14:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's quite correct, yes
2020-02-18T21:15:12  <Bosmon> But the nature of the bus is that the LFM end of it keeps a constantly updating snapshot of the current settings state
2020-02-18T21:15:24  <Bosmon> Once the UIO+ does connect, it obtains this snapshot
2020-02-18T21:15:34  <Bosmon> After that, changes can be initiated from either end, as long as the bus is live
2020-02-18T21:15:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so we do always want to send back changes as they are made from UIO+
2020-02-18T21:16:18  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, this is what the JIRA describes
2020-02-18T21:16:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: where does the WebSocket actually get its initial model from. I haven't figured that part out yet
2020-02-18T21:18:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. so currently the way things work is that when UIO+ launches it establishes a WebSocket connection to morphic. It gets the initial settings from morphic and any future updates. That way if someone has keyed in it will update the settings in UIO+
2020-02-18T21:19:13  <Justin_o> so now we also have, on updates to UIO+ send messages over the WebSocket to say we have changes you should take them?
2020-02-18T21:19:21  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it's in here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/WebSocketsSettingsHandler.js#L29
2020-02-18T21:19:33  <Justin_o> or will morphic be asking UIO+ periodically for it's current model value
2020-02-18T21:19:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it's a bidirectional bus :)
2020-02-18T21:19:56  <Bosmon> Web technologies have moved on a bit since the 2000s : P
2020-02-18T21:20:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it's still message relays, its not like a shared model I don't think
2020-02-18T21:20:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, how does that model in the code path you sent me get set?
2020-02-18T21:22:30  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it gets set here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/WebSocketsSettingsHandler.js#L121
2020-02-18T21:22:38  <Bosmon> The impl in practice is not terribly elaborate
2020-02-18T21:25:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm trying to figure out what calls that set
2020-02-18T21:25:26  <Bosmon> Justin_o - it is the natural action of the settings handler itself!
2020-02-18T21:25:35  <Bosmon> What you are looking at is the "set" action of the settings handler
2020-02-18T21:26:16  <Justin_o> I'm not entirely sure what that means.
2020-02-18T21:26:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - when someone calls the "set" action for a solution which is governed by the webSocketsSettingsHandler, e.g. UIO+, this is the method that gets called

2020-02-18T21:27:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, and the model values presumable come from the users preference?
2020-02-18T21:28:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the settings, yes : P
2020-02-18T21:32:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so at the moment it looks like the WS connection from UIO+ to morphic will on startup ask morphic for the settings, and will receive messages whenever there are changes to the settings. Now we'll also send a message to morphic to cause it to update its related settings.
