2019-01-23T14:12:44  <cindyli> Bosmon, javjarfer[m], after looking into https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3651, the issue with empty payload being sent to settingsHandler, I have some questions about whether the fix should be made in the solution registry for "com.microsoft.windows.mouseSettings" solution, or matchmaker, or both. can we meet to talk about this?
2019-01-23T14:13:55  <javjarfer[m]> Hi cindyli , sure, could we setup a meeting for tomorrow? Or were you thinking in today?
2019-01-23T14:14:46  <cindyli> better today, but i'm fine with tomorrow.
2019-01-23T14:15:14  <cindyli> depending on how urgent you want this to be solved, javjarfer[m] ;)
2019-01-23T14:16:03  <cindyli> you are the bug reporter, javjarfer[m]. just don't wanna block your work
2019-01-23T14:17:10  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli:  thanks, yes it's true. But I need to ask jhernandez about the time he wants something today, we are in a hurry for the ATIA demo and I was finishing work on ZoomText
2019-01-23T14:17:30  <cindyli> sure. let me know what time works for you.
2019-01-23T14:18:01  <cindyli> Bosmon: let us know what time works for you too
2019-01-23T14:18:19  <cindyli> i'm available anytime tomorrow

2019-01-23T14:25:35  <stegru> the-t-in-rtf Bosmon - for the suggestion box: win32.json could do with being split into files, it's soon to be >10k lines
2019-01-23T14:26:36  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I plan to do that once the validation  pull is merged and the pouch work is done
2019-01-23T14:27:07  <the-t-in-rtf> that file would be built from multiple smaller bits, likely one per solution

2019-01-23T14:32:18  <jhernandez> it's true that our win32 is becoming considerably large
2019-01-23T14:33:40  <the-t-in-rtf> we could choose to test solutions in isolation better, but might not want or need to up front
2019-01-23T14:33:45  <Bosmon> Yes
2019-01-23T14:33:50  <Bosmon> Of course it could be much worse
2019-01-23T14:33:52  <the-t-in-rtf> once we're using the couch harness,  you should notice the size a bit less
2019-01-23T14:34:00  <Bosmon> It could have been >10k lines of Java : P

2019-01-23T14:41:57  <alanharnum> stegru jhernandez: do we know when the Jaz drive image of Morphic will be ready for production use?
2019-01-23T14:43:26  <the-t-in-rtf> there's a name I haven't heard in a while.  I think I have like one of everything from my studies
2019-01-23T14:43:31  <the-t-in-rtf> like a syquest drive somewhere
2019-01-23T14:43:37  <the-t-in-rtf> various jaz and zip drives
2019-01-23T14:44:10  <alanharnum> It may reveal the excessive effort i put into that joke that i wrote "Zip drive" first, then replaced it with "Jaz drive" because that seemed more obscure
2019-01-23T14:44:45  <stegru> I doubt the installation could even fit on a zip drive
2019-01-23T14:45:07  <alanharnum> that's why you need that Jaz drive, with UP TO A GIGABYTE of storage
2019-01-23T14:48:51  <sgithens> alanharnum: hahahahaha
2019-01-23T14:49:18  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for super detailed write up and branch
2019-01-23T14:49:36  <the-t-in-rtf> you're welcome, sorry it was so long in coming
2019-01-23T14:49:52  <the-t-in-rtf> If I'd known you were going on holidays I'd have made the time earlier
2019-01-23T14:50:02  <the-t-in-rtf> or at least felt guiltier about it
2019-01-23T14:50:05  <the-t-in-rtf> earlier
2019-01-23T14:50:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I already feel guilty now, I just thought I had a little more time
2019-01-23T14:50:43  <sgithens>  No worries, the pouch stuff is pretty high priority
2019-01-23T14:52:46  <jhernandez> alanharnum: haha - in fact, I had to look for the "Jaz" drive xDDD
2019-01-23T14:53:59  <jhernandez> here we called it "zip" drive
2019-01-23T14:54:03  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: sorry, which is the time that best suits for you for that meeting?

2019-01-23T15:03:34  <Bosmon> yup
2019-01-23T15:03:51  <cindyli> great. thanks.
2019-01-23T15:09:54  <sgithens> bryan_: Iâ€™m still working on getting that task list ready today
2019-01-23T15:10:24  <bryan_> Thanks
2019-01-23T15:13:36  <bryan_> Bosmon: looks like I had a build failure https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-tests/850/
2019-01-23T15:13:52  <bryan_> Works in dev!
2019-01-23T15:14:03  <Bosmon> bryan_ well it's merged now anyway, too late for that : P
2019-01-23T15:14:14  <Bosmon> It worked fine locally
2019-01-23T15:16:02  <bryan_> The console output said vagrant was locked
2019-01-23T15:16:20  <bryan_> Vagrant can't use the requested machine because it is locked!
2019-01-23T15:16:32  <bryan_> So not code related
2019-01-23T15:16:39  <Bosmon> bryan_ - we seem to get such junk quite often with our Windows CI builds
2019-01-23T15:17:20  <Bosmon> Thanks for your work improving the coverage there
2019-01-23T15:17:49  <Bosmon> We've got a few other black spots across the repo but I don't see any particularly low-hanging looking fruit
2019-01-23T15:18:06  <Bosmon> So it is probably time to get you partnered on sgithens work :)
2019-01-23T15:20:13  <bryan_> I'm looking through the docs and then I'll dive into the task list later
2019-01-23T15:20:50  <bryan_> In my free time I'd like to get all coverage to 100% just for fun
2019-01-23T15:21:28  <bryan_> It's like being able to solve a Rubiks cube :)
2019-01-23T15:22:32  <Bosmon> bryan_ - well one gets involved in increasingly silly things the closer one gets to 100%.... such as provoking every possible subcase of every error-triggering pathway : P
2019-01-23T15:23:02  <Bosmon> I'd be happier once gpii-windows as a whole was above 80% branch coverage, but a good deal of what's left is "rejects"
2019-01-23T15:23:15  <Bosmon> And handlings of various OS-specific messages that it's hard to know if they are really every triggered
2019-01-23T15:24:06  <bryan_> Yeah I stopped short of triggering every branch of ternary operators
2019-01-23T15:27:17  <sgithens> Iâ€™m about to go in the air, but will be back down in 5 hours

2019-01-23T20:45:35  <colinclark> I'd like to set up a new mailing list
2019-01-23T20:45:45  <colinclark> is that something that I can do, or do you have to do it for me?
2019-01-23T20:50:22  <colinclark> michelled, simonjb: What do you think we should call the Coding to Learn and Create mailing list? (It's a rather long name, isn't it?)
2019-01-23T20:51:41  <simonjb> colinclark: c2lc is maybe too cryptic?
2019-01-23T20:51:53  <colinclark> it's a cool acronym
2019-01-23T20:51:57  <colinclark> but maybe cryptic

2019-01-23T20:56:57  <simonjb> or just coding@lists.inclusivedesign.ca ?
