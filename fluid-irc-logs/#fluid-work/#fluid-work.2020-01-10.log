2020-01-10T16:38:47  <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, the problem was the wrong type of quote around a json value: “0” vs "0"
2020-01-10T16:38:57  <stegru> in service.json5
2020-01-10T16:39:20  <stegru> that's why the service couldn't start morphic
2020-01-10T16:40:15  <stegru> when the desktop icon was licked, it started morphic in "peasant mode", where the secrets file could not be accessed (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4301)
2020-01-10T16:41:28  <stegru> I think the quotation thing is mac related, not that anyone is pointing a finger at you, the-t-in-rtf

2020-01-10T19:09:30  <cindyli> hi gmoss
2020-01-10T19:09:31  <gmoss> I have an infusion promises question: is it possible to call a promise in an invoker record in the same style as the "task" fixture in the IoC test framework?
2020-01-10T19:09:45  <gmoss> i'm drawing a blank and having trouble finding anything relevant in the docs
2020-01-10T19:09:59  <gmoss> I'm trying to avoid passing in a completion event or callback reference
2020-01-10T19:10:09  <greatislander> Hi avtar, if you have any luck with Netlify let me know— I'm hitting my build limits for one of the Platform Co-op projects
2020-01-10T19:10:31  <greatislander> It's currently on a free plan and I've exceeded 300 minutes in the past 30 days
2020-01-10T19:11:13  <avtar> greatislander: i haven't heard back yet :/
2020-01-10T19:11:20  <greatislander> okay no worries!
2020-01-10T19:11:48  <cindyli> gmoss: i don't think you can do the same with invokers. the only auto resolution for promises I know of is via the listener chain fired thru fluid.promise.fireTransformEvent()
2020-01-10T19:11:50  <Justin_o> gmoss: as far as I know there aren't tasks in the regular IoC framework.
2020-01-10T19:12:04  <Justin_o> gmoss: what is it that you are trying to do exactly

2020-01-10T19:16:11  <gmoss> Justin_o: sorry, I should have provided some context. I'm trying to address this review comment from Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#pullrequestreview-270700397
2020-01-10T19:16:11  <gmoss> what I'm attempting to do is make a new grade that will be a subcomponent of the page grade that will instantiate, load in the various required values from the server and then get rid of itself
2020-01-10T19:17:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: on first glance at your code I'm seeing the get requests. I'm thinking you may want to use https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataSource.js instead, which already makes use of the promise chains and synthetic events that cindyli mentioned
2020-01-10T19:18:11  *** christop_ <christop_!~textual@24.50.234.31> has quit IRC (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2020-01-10T19:18:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: the thought had crossed my mind.. am I able to configure a datasource to be a particular URL? I would need at least one of these per component
2020-01-10T19:18:47  <gmoss> like I would need a separate one for the View page in order to load the model for a single story from the server
2020-01-10T19:18:57  <gmoss> one for the clientConfig data
2020-01-10T19:18:58  <gmoss> and so on
2020-01-10T19:19:49  <Justin_o> gmoss: I don't believe so, but it might depend on the exact structure of your URLs. But you should be able make some of those changes through the directModel
2020-01-10T19:20:05  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataSource.js#L61-L79
2020-01-10T19:21:49  <gmoss> Justin_o: in the case of clientConfig, the URL is pretty straightforward: "/clientConfig", and for story data it would be "/stories" or "/stories/{a story ID}"
2020-01-10T19:23:08  <Justin_o> gmoss: if I'm not mistaking anything, you should be able to handle that with a change to the directModel
2020-01-10T19:23:24  <Justin_o> are the data types returned from all those sources the same
2020-01-10T19:23:36  <gmoss> they are consistent
2020-01-10T19:23:42  <gmoss> sorry, not with each other
2020-01-10T19:23:50  <Justin_o> I mean are they all json
2020-01-10T19:23:54  <gmoss> ah, yes
2020-01-10T19:24:15  <Justin_o> and or is there any other processing that needs to happen before reading/writing to the source that may differ between endpoints
2020-01-10T19:24:26  <Justin_o> if so, you may need different datasources for those
2020-01-10T19:26:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: there wouldn't be any further processing of the return value, short of some potential validation (which doesn't yet exist). I should mention that the data returned is a JSON string, not actual JSON, so it would need to be parsed
2020-01-10T19:26:43  <Justin_o> also I'm still not sure how this all relates to that comment. Maybe because I don't know what the "see below" in the comment is referencing. What exactly is "storyBrowseComponent"?
2020-01-10T19:26:58  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah it relates to the comment immediately below as well

2020-01-10T19:27:52  <Justin_o> gmoss: yep makes sense to be a stringified version for the transmission. The data source can parse that automatically in and out. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataSource.js#L23-L59
2020-01-10T19:28:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: storyBrowseComponent is an instance of a new Browse page component that is created with the model data grabbed from the server call, and then storyBrowseComponent is returned in a promise

2020-01-10T19:29:24  <Justin_o> gmoss: are you destroying that component in the tests?
2020-01-10T19:29:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: I am not, hence the review comment ;)

2020-01-10T19:29:58  <gmoss> so the plan is to set up a new grade that does all that lifting and then gets rid of itself, and i can test for its destruction
2020-01-10T19:30:14  <gmoss> and I can also create it on demand independently of the page grade
2020-01-10T19:30:23  <gmoss> which will make mocking it in the tests simpler

2020-01-10T19:30:59  <gmoss> this is all very exploratory at this point, so I may not be going down the right path
2020-01-10T19:31:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay
2020-01-10T19:32:30  <Justin_o> gmoss: I take it you are working on https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35#discussion_r310558525
2020-01-10T19:33:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's right, sorry would have been more accurate to link you to that comment, but i thought seeing all three together might be better
2020-01-10T19:33:32  <Justin_o> gmoss: good to see them all, thanks..

2020-01-10T19:35:29  <gmoss> Justin_o: this new "pageLoader" is the disposable component I've been trying to create
2020-01-10T19:35:34  <Justin_o> gmoss: I think what he might be suggesting, but I could be wrong, is something kind of like the prefsLoader in the prefs framework. Where instead of having "sjrk.storyTelling.loadBrowse" be a simple function that returns a promise resolved with an instantiated component, you'd make it a component itself. It would have a subcomponent of the storyBrowser component that is created after all the configuration has been
2020-01-10T19:35:34  <Justin_o> fetched.

2020-01-10T19:35:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: right, that makes sense
2020-01-10T19:36:09  <gmoss> It's the how of it that I'm tripping over haha
2020-01-10T19:36:48  <gmoss> my goal with my initial question wasn't to call loadBrowse, but to have an invoker that can make the call to the server to get the data
2020-01-10T19:37:07  <gmoss> and then put that in a model value and go from there
2020-01-10T19:37:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: ah okay.. well maybe start with the datasource for that.. it should take care of the broad strokes, with you just filling in the details of things.. like where to fetch the data and what do with it
2020-01-10T19:38:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'll give it a shot :) thanks!
2020-01-10T19:38:28  <Justin_o> gmoss: good luck :)
2020-01-10T19:38:39  <Justin_o> I'm heading offline now, but we can chat more on Monday if you'd liek

2020-01-10T19:38:48  <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good. have a great weekend!
2020-01-10T19:38:52  <Justin_o> you too
2020-01-10T19:39:16  <Bosmon> Justin_o, gmoss- sounds like you have this all in hand : P
2020-01-10T19:39:21  <Bosmon> Have a great weekend, Justin_o :)
2020-01-10T19:39:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks you too :)
2020-01-10T19:39:53  <gmoss> Bosmon: we'll see how far I get haha. I have a good starting point at least. does it seem to you that I have understood your review correctly?
2020-01-10T19:40:15  <Bosmon> gmoss - yes, looks like it
2020-01-10T19:40:19  <gmoss> great
2020-01-10T19:40:29  <gmoss> I'll proceed with hax0ring, then
2020-01-10T19:40:32  <Bosmon> You need to express the contruction of your component as a subcomponent construction
2020-01-10T19:40:47  <Bosmon> And that way the natural action of the IoC testing framework will tear it down automatically when the fixtures are done
2020-01-10T19:40:55  <Bosmon> As long as it is a subcomponent of your test environment
2020-01-10T19:41:41  <gmoss> Bosmon: right, so given a grade pageLoader that does all the things we've described, i make a testEnvironment that has a pageLoader subcomponent and it all falls into place
