2019-07-19T08:47:25  <the-t-in-rtf> that payload is no longer valid, I think you got away with it because my old checks didn't have the allowBollocks setting disabled
2019-07-19T08:47:39  <the-t-in-rtf> just looking for a valid sample payload to replace it with
2019-07-19T08:56:33  <the-t-in-rtf> or to confirm that I can feed Daniel to the lions
2019-07-19T09:06:09  <stegru> i don't know, the-t-in-rtf
2019-07-19T09:12:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I am renaming the bad stuff for now, we can discuss in a wider context.
2019-07-19T09:18:16  <the-t-in-rtf> franklin is in bad shape, that's a RWG one
2019-07-19T09:18:47  <the-t-in-rtf> from now on it should be clear when you change an app and leave an old test preference set behind
2019-07-19T09:20:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I hope @javjarfer[m] is around
2019-07-19T09:21:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I just found an issue with a badly copied and pasted setting in the SR itself.
2019-07-19T09:21:51  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/dc02ce69ad667d929ab5b15ba570ebe2c3038d95/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10594
2019-07-19T09:22:10  <the-t-in-rtf> It's an exact copy of the previous setting and makes zero sense in context.
2019-07-19T09:22:34  <the-t-in-rtf> I will file a bug and assign it to @javjarfer[m] unless someone else wants to own up to that.
2019-07-19T09:26:05  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4035
2019-07-19T09:27:14  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, that's all the madness at least until I merge with upstream.
2019-07-19T09:27:52  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the only one that needs real fixing, I just cut out the bogus individual settings for the rest.

2019-07-19T11:28:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon2: related to our conversation yesterday about the random test failures, you can simulate the issue by https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactorTests.js#L275 changing it to var childNode = undefined;
2019-07-19T11:28:36  <Justin_o> In this way you can see the test run stalling
2019-07-19T11:38:54  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon2, the flow manager settings put tests seem to be broken in master.
2019-07-19T11:39:48  <the-t-in-rtf> they fail when requiring the put test defs
2019-07-19T11:41:03  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, I guess something else performs the require that fixes that, might just be an ordering thing
2019-07-19T11:41:29  <the-t-in-rtf> In any case you can't just require the put test defs on their own, which seems sub-optimal

2019-07-19T14:45:57  <alanharnum> Justin_o: I think I have found the source of the intermittent CI failures you and I (and possibly others) have been seeing. I've opened a separate JIRA and PR for the issue: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6383
2019-07-19T14:50:05  <alanharnum> Short form: Chrome and Headless Chrome both get run under current Infusion Testem config. Headless Chrome appears to cause some consistent issues running the Syllabification tests. I'd advocate removing Headless Chrome from what testem runs unless we have a definite reason to include it alongside regular Chrome.
2019-07-19T14:51:57  <alanharnum> (this is the cause of the longstanding "Chrome runs twice with testem" issue - testem doesn't distinguish between Chrome and Headless Chrome in the reporting, but does if you run 'node .\node_modules\testem\testem.js launchers' to see the list of launchers)
2019-07-19T14:55:27  <jhernandez> cindyli: that works for me ;)
2019-07-19T14:57:53  <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez. i'm sending an email so everyone involved in that meeting can pick a time.
2019-07-19T15:06:15  <stegru> Here's the "readwrite gold + office no worky" bug: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4036 - it actually involves a combination of updating a preference while having non-live liveness solutions
2019-07-19T15:06:32  <stegru> cindyli Bosmon2 jhernandez might be more interested in this than I
2019-07-19T15:10:00  <cindyli> stegru: the jira says "Change a setting in the quick strip, such as the office simplification or volume". does the restart only happens when changing these 2 settings?
2019-07-19T15:10:40  <stegru> no, any - like the screen zoom.. it's just that those two setting don't cause much fuss with the display
2019-07-19T15:10:51  <stegru> they're fairly inert
2019-07-19T15:10:57  <cindyli> ok

2019-07-19T15:15:05  <stegru> ok cindyli , it might only be the settings who use the launchhandler - because keying in with catalina doesn't cause the language to be re-applied
2019-07-19T15:15:38  <stegru> i mean, the launch-handler settings get re-applied even if they don't need to be
2019-07-19T15:15:51  <cindyli> ok
2019-07-19T15:20:14  <colinclark> Justin_o, gmoss: My friend Luke Church is visiting Toronto from Cambridge during the week of July 29th
2019-07-19T15:20:28  <cindyli> stegru: "com.microsoft.windows.magnifier" used by carla also has launch handler settings
2019-07-19T15:20:31  <colinclark> could we potentially earmark the community workshop that week for him?
2019-07-19T15:20:33  <gmoss> colinclark: are you thinking of inviting him to present?

2019-07-19T16:00:19  <Justin_o> @alanharnum: the issue I’m seeing might be slightly different but could be exasperated by things running twice. I’m tracking it at https://issues.fluidproject.org/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/FLUID-6382
2019-07-19T16:01:05  <alanharnum> Justin_o: If they consistently fail on the second time Chrome runs, that's headless Chrome. Do the first set of Chrome tests always pass?
2019-07-19T16:01:30  <alanharnum> That's what I've been seeing on the failures of my PR - Chrome passes, Headless Chrome hangs and fails at the Syllabification tests
2019-07-19T16:04:23  <Justin_o> alanharnum: I’m actually can reproduce on macOS just running the syllabification enactor tests in Chrome incognito. Very random though.
2019-07-19T16:06:18  <Justin_o> gmoss, colinclark: I think July 31 should be fine. I don’t know of anything else booked for then.
2019-07-19T16:07:10  <colinclark> great, thanks
2019-07-19T16:24:23  <gmoss> Justin_o colinclark: I've marked that date as "to be confirmed"
