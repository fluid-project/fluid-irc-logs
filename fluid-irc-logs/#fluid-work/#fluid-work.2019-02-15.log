2019-02-15T11:41:59  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there the-t-in-rtf ! Are you available for a fast schema question?
2019-02-15T11:42:24  <the-t-in-rtf> sure
2019-02-15T11:44:10  <javjarfer[m]> nice, so we are currently using this schema for representing a object holding rgb valueshttps://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/657/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R3921
2019-02-15T11:44:51  * javjarfer[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/HVpHMgegAZWgJxqlRDUHgCkH >
2019-02-15T11:45:07  <javjarfer[m]> but I don't know how to represent such enum
2019-02-15T11:46:20  <the-t-in-rtf> what do you mean, "such enum"?
2019-02-15T11:46:55  <javjarfer[m]> the one I wrote, holding a "rgbObject" of that kind
2019-02-15T11:47:05  <the-t-in-rtf> why are you using an enum?
2019-02-15T11:47:14  <the-t-in-rtf> is there another completely different type of value?
2019-02-15T11:47:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, enum is literal values
2019-02-15T11:47:42  <the-t-in-rtf> there are other constructs when you have multiple completely different data types
2019-02-15T11:48:13  <javjarfer[m]> Okay, I wasn't using a enum yet, I wasn't using anything really because I didn't know how to express it
2019-02-15T11:48:24  <the-t-in-rtf> describe it in words and I can talk you through it
2019-02-15T11:48:54  <the-t-in-rtf> links to examples of values would be good if you have any
2019-02-15T11:49:28  <javjarfer[m]> okay, so basically is a object holding two possible types, or it holds the "rgbObject" described above, or it holds the literal "auto"
2019-02-15T11:51:39  <the-t-in-rtf> then you need the "oneOf" construct
2019-02-15T11:51:57  <the-t-in-rtf> where you have two definitions, one for the string, one for the object
2019-02-15T11:52:20  <the-t-in-rtf> you should add titles and descriptions, as Steve Githens won't have enum labels or anything to work with.
2019-02-15T11:52:35  <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec, link for oneOf is coming
2019-02-15T11:52:49  <javjarfer[m]> nice, was about to ask
2019-02-15T11:53:01  <javjarfer[m]> another tool in the box for describing settings
2019-02-15T11:53:22  <the-t-in-rtf> http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.7.3
2019-02-15T11:53:42  <the-t-in-rtf> you should at mention Steve Githens once you've committed your work and get his feedback
2019-02-15T11:53:56  <the-t-in-rtf> as he'll have to figure out whether and how people can enter those
2019-02-15T11:54:50  <the-t-in-rtf> since only "auto" is allowed, I'm going to suggest something a little counterintuitive
2019-02-15T11:55:02  <the-t-in-rtf> each part of your oneOf is a "sub schema"
2019-02-15T11:55:11  <the-t-in-rtf> one "sub schema" will simply describe the rgb object
2019-02-15T11:55:17  <the-t-in-rtf> the other will be a one-item enum
2019-02-15T11:55:32  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. enum: ["auto"], enumLabels:["Auto"]
2019-02-15T11:56:08  <the-t-in-rtf> you could also do it with a pattern, but it seems clearer to use enum for literal values even if there's only one
2019-02-15T11:57:22  <the-t-in-rtf> so your overall structure is something like: { oneOf: [ { // enum definition for 'auto' }, { // rgb object definition} ] }
2019-02-15T11:57:25  <the-t-in-rtf> make sense?
2019-02-15T12:00:33  <javjarfer[m]> yes, it's exactly was I was thinking, I was not thinking into restricting the first one with enum tho, but it's what makes more sense, since it's a literal value
2019-02-15T12:03:11  <the-t-in-rtf> cool, let me know if you need more help
2019-02-15T12:04:01  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf:  well, I was just going to pass you this https://pastebin.com/duG4MX9Z
2019-02-15T12:04:13  <javjarfer[m]> so, I left it like that
2019-02-15T12:04:36  <the-t-in-rtf> looks great
2019-02-15T12:05:03  <the-t-in-rtf> do please at mention Steve Githens to get him thinking about how to enter that
2019-02-15T12:05:05  <javjarfer[m]> nice
2019-02-15T12:05:19  <the-t-in-rtf> he may just come back to me, but it's the kind of thing he and I need to be talking about anyway
2019-02-15T12:06:07  <javjarfer[m]> of course, I will mention him in Github once I have updated the pull with this
2019-02-15T12:18:31  <javjarfer[m]> Hi the-t-in-rtf , another question that may become relevant soon
2019-02-15T12:19:08  <javjarfer[m]> do we have any tag to put inside the settings schema to specify that the setting is just for internal usage?
2019-02-15T12:20:53  <the-t-in-rtf> no, that metadata will have to live outside of the schema for the allowed values
2019-02-15T12:21:20  <the-t-in-rtf> so, think of the setting definition, that also has rules that govern what you can enter
2019-02-15T12:21:40  <the-t-in-rtf> we would add a rule to say that you can specific "internal": true optionally, or something like that
2019-02-15T12:21:54  <javjarfer[m]> okay, what about leaving that setting without schema? Could that mean that we are "not exposing it"?
2019-02-15T12:22:02  <the-t-in-rtf> no, that means I have to killyou
2019-02-15T12:22:17  <javjarfer[m]> then that's not the best option
2019-02-15T12:22:26  <the-t-in-rtf> just kidding, but there should be no settings that we ourselves don't know enough about to describe
2019-02-15T12:22:27  <javjarfer[m]> xdddd
2019-02-15T12:22:41  <the-t-in-rtf> someone might stuff whatever they like in there
2019-02-15T12:23:22  <the-t-in-rtf> https://gifer.com/en/91t
2019-02-15T12:24:04  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, think of it as a bit of metadata for our use, like "liveness"
2019-02-15T12:24:32  <the-t-in-rtf> although in your case the metadata would be in the setting rather than the configuration level
2019-02-15T12:24:48  <the-t-in-rtf> this is another good one to hit Steve Githens up about
2019-02-15T12:24:58  <the-t-in-rtf> as he'd have to know about and decide not to expose the setting
2019-02-15T12:25:07  <the-t-in-rtf> he may already be using a similar convention in his work
2019-02-15T12:25:57  <javjarfer[m]> yes... he might be already doing that
2019-02-15T12:26:00  <the-t-in-rtf> exactly
2019-02-15T12:26:31  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, that "schema" field within a setting is only used to describe the allowed values that can be passed around
2019-02-15T12:26:31  <javjarfer[m]> great, so I will leave it like that, and mention him in the pull too
2019-02-15T12:26:38  <javjarfer[m]> let's move the conversation to Github
2019-02-15T12:26:40  <the-t-in-rtf> we shouldn't be stuffing any other info in there, IMO
2019-02-15T12:26:43  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds great
2019-02-15T12:26:58  <the-t-in-rtf> since he and I have such limited overlap that's better for that particular conversation
2019-02-15T12:27:04  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "we shouldn't be stuffing any oth"> makes total sense
2019-02-15T12:27:24  <javjarfer[m]> for us or for anyone, the spec still being the spec
2019-02-15T12:27:48  <the-t-in-rtf> the only bits of metadata in the schema are those that describe how it should be presented as a UI
2019-02-15T12:28:01  <the-t-in-rtf> which is another key use for the schema data
2019-02-15T12:28:28  <javjarfer[m]> agree
2019-02-15T12:28:38  <the-t-in-rtf> any other metadata like how to configure the setting, etc. belongs higher up and not in the schema
2019-02-15T12:28:57  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, we're agreeing, just spelling it out in case anyone is listening who didn't already know or had another opinino
2019-02-15T12:28:59  <the-t-in-rtf> opinion
2019-02-15T12:29:33  <the-t-in-rtf> opiniño sounds like an opiononated boy.
2019-02-15T12:32:00  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "anyway, we're agreeing, just spe"> yes, totally
2019-02-15T12:32:22  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "opiniño sounds like an opiononat"> haha it sounds at least in Spanish

2019-02-15T17:16:03  <jhernandez> cindyli, Bosmon: hey there
2019-02-15T17:16:14  <jhernandez> I have a quick question regarding the "Reset to STD" file
2019-02-15T17:16:15  <sepidehshahi> this is unbelievable colinclark! this puts them in a more difficult situation
2019-02-15T17:17:11  <jhernandez> we copy the defaultSettings.json5 file to the user's Roaming folder
2019-02-15T17:17:53  <jhernandez> but, what if the site admins want to update that file?
2019-02-15T17:18:09  <jhernandez> (after there is one that has been used for some time)
2019-02-15T17:18:51  <cindyli> jhernandez: the admin edit defaultSettings.json5 in the user's Roaming folder
2019-02-15T17:19:05  <jhernandez> for every user in the computer, right?
2019-02-15T17:19:06  <cindyli> should edit
2019-02-15T17:19:32  <cindyli> because every user has its own roaming folder? if so, would be a yes
2019-02-15T17:20:21  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@192.0.159.124> has quit IRC (Quit: colinclark)
2019-02-15T17:21:15  <jhernandez> okay, my question then is: wouldn't be easier for them if we can say "oh, there's a new defaultSettings.json5, let's replace the old with the new one" ?
2019-02-15T17:22:16  <jhernandez> I'm okay with the current behavior, we can always provide a script to siteadmins that does that
2019-02-15T17:24:06  <cindyli> jhernandez: so, what's your suggestion about pushing the new defaultSettings.json5? detect the change of defaultSettings.json5 automatically in the universal/testData/defaultSettings folder?
2019-02-15T17:24:42  <jhernandez> dunno
2019-02-15T17:25:24  <jhernandez> maybe, we can assume that the right defaultSettings.json5 file is whatever is in the app's folder, not the user's one ?
2019-02-15T17:25:29  <jhernandez> by a diff?
2019-02-15T17:26:11  <jhernandez> this is
2019-02-15T17:27:38  <jhernandez> the system starts and check if the user's defaultSettings.json5 file is there AND that it is in fact the one that is under the app's folder (a.k.a. universal/testData/defaultSettings)
2019-02-15T17:29:05  <jhernandez> if it doesn't exist or is different than the one in the app's folder, copy it there
2019-02-15T17:30:26  <cindyli> one drawback of this approach is, at a gpii-app reinstall, universal folder will be replaced and whatever changes to universal/testData/defaultSettings will be lost
2019-02-15T17:32:48  <cindyli> i think this is the main reason that it's decided to copy defaultSettings.json5 from universal folder to user's own folder at implementing this feature. Users have controls of their own defaultSettings but the one in the universal folder will be in sync with the suggested defaults
2019-02-15T17:40:40  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-02-15T17:40:45  <jhernandez> right
2019-02-15T17:41:34  <jhernandez> okay
2019-02-15T17:42:52  <jhernandez> well, in any case, I guess that we might revisit this once the "Reset to STD" prefSet is retrieved from the prefs server, as planned (not sure by when, but yeah)
2019-02-15T17:44:59  <jhernandez> cindyli: thanks for the help! :)
2019-02-15T17:59:16  <cindyli> np :)
2019-02-15T18:00:26  <cindyli> umm.. didn't know the "Reset to STD" prefSet is planned to be retrieved from the cloud. good to be aware. thanks.

2019-02-15T18:33:09  <gmoss> cindyli: let me double-check real quick, but yes I believe that's right, we just need to make a Jira for the styling bug and the firefox spacebar issue
2019-02-15T18:33:17  <gmoss> I can file themn
2019-02-15T18:33:18  <cindyli> can you leave comments on those pull requests with new jiras once they are created? thanks
2019-02-15T18:33:18  <gmoss> *themn
2019-02-15T18:33:23  <cindyli> cool
2019-02-15T18:33:32  <gmoss> gah *them lol...  Yes I'll make them now and do that
2019-02-15T18:42:56  <gmoss> cindyli: both PR's have comments linking to their respective Jiras, now
2019-02-15T18:43:05  <cindyli> great. thanks, gmoss
2019-02-15T18:43:21  <gmoss> I suspect SJRK-225 may have to be escalated to Mozilla
2019-02-15T18:43:22  <gmoss> but we'll see
2019-02-15T18:43:26  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@205.211.168.101> has joined #fluid-work
2019-02-15T18:47:24  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm thinking, today, about the combining of the repos, and I feel that it might be best to wait until the current PR's are merged in before I go ahead with that. what do you think?
2019-02-15T18:50:12  <cindyli> i agree, gmoss
2019-02-15T18:53:04  <gmoss> cindyli: Okay great :) in that case, I'll continue reading about the best way to do it, and will plan for today. I'll probably hold off the actual merging work until I'm back on the 25th
2019-02-15T18:54:39  <cindyli> sounds a good plan. thanks, gmoss

2019-02-15T18:58:07  <sgithens> javjarfer[m] the-t-in-rtf Just catching up on the IRC from early today.  Which branch / ticket are the oneOf's you're working on for?  Along with why the setting is internal use only?
2019-02-15T18:59:24  <the-t-in-rtf> there are a few that have TODOs and comments about their not being for public use, but yes, context is good
2019-02-15T19:00:04  <sgithens> I guess we don't really have any concept about settings that aren't for public use...
2019-02-15T19:00:18  <sgithens> what does mean?  That they are too difficult to understand for a person to set up?
2019-02-15T19:00:33  <sgithens> That would apply to a vast numder of settings in on our solutions :)
2019-02-15T19:01:04  <the-t-in-rtf> well, some of them we hard-code
2019-02-15T19:01:22  <the-t-in-rtf> those are perfect examples of ones we need to set but that we can't allow people to change
2019-02-15T19:01:29  <sgithens> ah
2019-02-15T19:01:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the voice profile for JAWS is a prime example
2019-02-15T19:01:37  <sgithens> oh i see
2019-02-15T19:01:51  <sgithens> so does the schema for it have only possible value?
2019-02-15T19:01:58  <sgithens> in that event, even if it showed up in an editor
2019-02-15T19:01:59  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, it's a single-value enum
2019-02-15T19:02:03  <sgithens> it would be the only option
2019-02-15T19:02:06  <the-t-in-rtf> right
2019-02-15T19:02:09  <sgithens> although I guess it could still be deleted
2019-02-15T19:02:26  <the-t-in-rtf> but we have talked about having metadata to make circles of configurability
2019-02-15T19:02:35  <the-t-in-rtf> like a first circle that's stuff most people care about
2019-02-15T19:02:44  <the-t-in-rtf> and eventually a circle where you can edit absolutely everything
2019-02-15T19:02:50  <sgithens> I think that it is the name of your next electronic album
2019-02-15T19:03:01  <the-t-in-rtf> you're not wrong
2019-02-15T19:03:30  <sgithens> :)
2019-02-15T19:03:52  <sgithens> But the first circle is something that would show up in a reasonable tool, like the PSP or QSS, and then everything would show up in the PPT
2019-02-15T19:04:41  <the-t-in-rtf> you could also talk about metadata to group settings, which we haven't really done yet
2019-02-15T19:04:51  <the-t-in-rtf> there's a whole range of stuff we could do to categorise settings
2019-02-15T19:05:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm remembering now our earlier discussions, visibility might be stored elsewhere as a layer over the SR
2019-02-15T19:05:38  <the-t-in-rtf> like a list of settings that are visible at a given level of complexity
2019-02-15T19:05:58  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Did your big Jaws pull make it in to master yet?
2019-02-15T19:06:00  <the-t-in-rtf> my point with JJ was that the visibility was definitely not part of the schema
2019-02-15T19:06:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I think the first one did
2019-02-15T19:06:17  <the-t-in-rtf> the smaller aftershocks are stalled behind the couch pull
2019-02-15T19:06:49  <the-t-in-rtf> as are the NVDA and MAGic pulls
2019-02-15T19:06:54  <sgithens> I want to get Amarja set up with editing RWG, JAWS, and Zoomtext next week, and trying to figure out which solutions registry branches I might need to pull in for the schema drving the PPT she's using
2019-02-15T19:07:11  <the-t-in-rtf> my hope is that we can unstick a bunch of stuff once the couch pull is in
2019-02-15T19:09:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I believe master has most of the settings
2019-02-15T19:09:33  <the-t-in-rtf> the pulls cover new stuff for JAWS 2019
2019-02-15T19:09:56  <the-t-in-rtf> JJ would be better able to comment on the other two
2019-02-15T19:10:23  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe hit him up when you're making coffee before yoga, I'm sure he's already off to enjoy his evening
2019-02-15T19:10:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm only here by pure coincidence
2019-02-15T19:12:23  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I happened to sit down to research weekend stuff
2019-02-15T19:16:54  <sgithens> :)
2019-02-15T19:17:03  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Big plans?
2019-02-15T19:17:23  <the-t-in-rtf> biking around various playgrounds, nice lunch, building new instruments
2019-02-15T19:17:32  <sgithens> nice
2019-02-15T19:17:33  <the-t-in-rtf> the usual

2019-02-15T21:46:22  <cindyli> clown: is there an example of how to use aria attributes for a busy animation spinner?
2019-02-15T21:47:05  <clown> cindyli:  thinking …
2019-02-15T21:47:28  <clown> what does the spinning tell the user?
2019-02-15T21:47:51  <clown> is this a visual cue that the app is doing something, and the user is to wait?
2019-02-15T21:48:25  <cindyli> it has a spinner with a text "publishing, please wait…" besides
2019-02-15T21:49:46  <clown> okay.  that's what would be captured in aria as an "indeterminate progress bar".  There's progress, but no indication of how much remains.
2019-02-15T21:49:59  <gmoss> clown: (I think it's safe to assume cindyli is reviewing my SJRK-216 PR's) indeed, the intention is that the user is alerted that their submission is being processed and that they should wait until it completes. this does not disable any other aspects of the page
2019-02-15T21:50:07  <cindyli> exactly, gmoss
2019-02-15T21:50:12  <clown> Here is the aria specification for that:  https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#progressbar
2019-02-15T21:50:33  <gmoss> cindyli clown: lliskovoi was suggesting perhaps using aria-role="alert" but somehow it didn't seem right to me
2019-02-15T21:51:12  <gmoss> clown: I had trouble grokking the progressbar in the case where I wouldn't have a max, min or currentvalue, but i'll give it another look :) thanks!
2019-02-15T21:51:28  <cindyli> my search shows an use of - role="alert" aria-busy="true"
2019-02-15T21:51:34  <cindyli> but not sure if it's right
2019-02-15T21:51:52  <clown> yes, gmoss look closely at the description for the word "indeterminate" and how to set min/max/now for that case.
2019-02-15T21:54:09  <gmoss> clown: I think this was the source of my confusion. in this case, it looks like I should omit the aria-valuenow attribute, but what about aria-valuemax and aria-valuemin? would it be appropriate to set them both to 0 or some other value?
2019-02-15T21:55:00  <clown> gmoss, I'd set them to 0% and 100%
2019-02-15T21:55:31  <clown> in essence, saying, that progress starts at nothing and is complete when progress is finished.
2019-02-15T21:56:43  <clown> or, actually  aria-valuemin="0" and aria-valuemax="100"
2019-02-15T21:58:01  <gmoss> clown: thanks! I'll give that a shot
2019-02-15T21:59:02  <clown> gmoss, does the page change when progress is complete?  There's stuff in the aria spec about the progress bar showing the status of some other region of the page.  Does that apply to your case?
2019-02-15T21:59:41  <gmoss> clown: if progress completes successfully, the user is redirected to another page. if it fails, the progress bar is hidden and a message is displayed
2019-02-15T22:00:18  <gmoss> clown: it's not loading other parts of the page, if that's what you're asking about
2019-02-15T22:00:54  <clown> okay, then the stuff in the spec about using aria-desribedby and aria-busy on the region that is updating does *not* apply.  You can ignore that part.
2019-02-15T22:02:21  <gmoss> clown: indeed, I found some posts on SO suggesting using both of those attributes, but then I read the docs on W3C and, like you say, ignored it :)
2019-02-15T22:02:43  <gmoss> it's tricky stuff
2019-02-15T22:02:52  <gmoss> well, for the uninitiated
2019-02-15T22:02:53  <stegru> jhernandez, I can't reproduce the service related instability - I'd love it if you could see if you still get it next week
2019-02-15T22:03:22  <clown> nah, it's tricky stuff period.
2019-02-15T22:03:52  <clown> okay, gmoss — it's past 5pm and my carriage is about to turn back into a pumpkin.  Time to split.
2019-02-15T22:04:02  <gmoss> clown: thanks for your help!
2019-02-15T22:04:17  <gmoss> sorry to hijack your review cindyli  :)
2019-02-15T22:05:08  <cindyli> nah, i'm glad you explained in such a great detail. thanks, gmoss. i'm going to leave a comment on the pull for this part as a reminder
2019-02-15T22:07:25  <clown> no problem, gmoss.  have a nice weekend everyone.
