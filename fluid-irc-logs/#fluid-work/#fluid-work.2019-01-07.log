2019-01-07T13:02:47  <jhernandez> stegru: hey there
2019-01-07T13:02:55  <stegru> hello!
2019-01-07T13:03:00  <jhernandez> happy new year BTW
2019-01-07T13:03:08  <stegru> you too
2019-01-07T13:03:19  <stegru> have a nice break?
2019-01-07T13:03:39  <jhernandez> really nice, yeah
2019-01-07T13:03:46  <jhernandez> although it ended up with a spanish flu
2019-01-07T13:03:53  <jhernandez> (as always)
2019-01-07T13:03:56  <jhernandez> :/
2019-01-07T13:03:59  <stegru> you always get that
2019-01-07T13:04:33  <jhernandez> yeh, I should consider stop going to Spain for holidays
2019-01-07T13:05:09  <jhernandez> how about you? Santa was fair?
2019-01-07T13:05:33  <stegru> no, I'm on the naughty list
2019-01-07T13:05:37  <jhernandez> haha
2019-01-07T13:05:52  <jhernandez> I knew it!
2019-01-07T13:05:56  <stegru> :(
2019-01-07T13:06:47  <jhernandez> in Spain, bad boys get charcoal
2019-01-07T13:06:47  <stegru> I do have a late present for you.. I may have fixed the language problem ;)
2019-01-07T13:07:04  <jhernandez> ohh
2019-01-07T13:07:12  <stegru> yes, same here... in fact, a few years ago I pretended that my daughter got some
2019-01-07T13:07:19  <jhernandez> that's sweet!
2019-01-07T13:07:21  <jhernandez> :P
2019-01-07T13:07:48  <stegru> it's a valuable fuel
2019-01-07T13:08:00  <jhernandez> sweet = your present, not the charcoal for your daughter
2019-01-07T13:08:06  <stegru> ah haha
2019-01-07T13:08:30  <jhernandez> but yeah, charcoal might be valuable in the future, who knows
2019-01-07T13:08:34  <jhernandez> :P
2019-01-07T13:09:00  <jhernandez> okay, in fact I've just compiled a list of things for the 1.0.1 release
2019-01-07T13:09:09  <stegru> ok
2019-01-07T13:09:12  <jhernandez> stegru: https://pad.gpii.net/p/morphic-1-0-1-5oa4n0y
2019-01-07T13:15:19  <stegru> jhernandez, finished commenting. I think this list covers everything
2019-01-07T13:16:13  <stegru> as far as i'm aware
2019-01-07T13:17:34  <stegru> I'll do the capitalised regions in a bit (3605) - it shouldn't take long
2019-01-07T13:22:30  <jhernandez> stegru: okay, thanks for commenting
2019-01-07T13:24:35  <jhernandez> wrt 3605, where is that thing coming from? I thought that windows was including the capitalised region

2019-01-07T13:29:24  <stegru> I think it came from the registry, jhernandez
2019-01-07T13:30:30  <stegru> I'm not sure if we should change it - perhaps just use the upper case when displaying it in QSS

2019-01-07T13:32:17  <stegru> <stegru> I think it came from the registry, jhernandez

2019-01-07T13:43:09  <jhernandez> stegru: do you mean displaying or using the upper case when setting the value from the QSS?
2019-01-07T13:44:25  <stegru> I'm not sure yet, jhernandez - I mean, if the registry says "es-es".. and we apply the setting as "es-ES".. would that break things?
2019-01-07T13:44:36  <stegru> who knows
2019-01-07T13:45:06  <jhernandez> as far as I remember, the registry always use the upper case region
2019-01-07T13:45:15  <jhernandez> but I might be wrong

2019-01-07T14:57:22  <stegru> it's ok - better late than never ;)
2019-01-07T14:57:42  <dandimitrov> Weâ€™re not displaying the code but rather use them as values for the different options
2019-01-07T14:58:48  <stegru> ahh! ok, in the psp?
2019-01-07T14:59:23  <dandimitrov> oh, the PSP simply uses the user language preference :?
2019-01-07T15:00:53  <dandimitrov> I think the optoins for the language settings in general are not computed using the installed languages but hardcoded instead
2019-01-07T15:01:10  <stegru> ok

2019-01-07T22:33:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, before the winter break I remember we were talking about changes you were making to the resourceLoader. I can't remember all the details now, but I'm checking because I'm looking into FLUID-6332 which seems to require me to add another message loader to the table of contents enactor. That's the quick solution. The better solution would probably involve some major refactoring of the whole prefs framework, but
2019-01-07T22:33:04  <Justin_o> not entirely sure.
2019-01-07T22:33:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: anyways, in looking at the resource loader for that, I'm wondering if the locale should be in a model instead of an option.
2019-01-07T22:33:45  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I feel sure that the locale should be in a model
2019-01-07T22:33:59  <Bosmon> The resourceLoader refactoring is a little bit long-term since it is in my big framework branch
2019-01-07T22:34:06  <Bosmon> So it shouldn't impact any ongoing work for a while
2019-01-07T22:34:38  <Bosmon> The idea is that I am constantly tracking current trunk and keeping everything working wrt to it, until there is some suitable point to unveil all the ongoing work in a "big bang"
2019-01-07T22:35:37  <Bosmon> This bang might be triggered by i) some ongoing work that would be desperately improved by having the new functionality, and/or ii) some lull in our other ongoing work where we would have more resources to deal with unexpected breakages
2019-01-07T22:38:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for the update, and that all makes sense. Also sounds like it isn't something that I'll see before my leave starts in 2 weeks ;)
2019-01-07T22:39:11  <Bosmon> Justin_o - for sure - one would hope you would at least see it on the point you come back :)
2019-01-07T22:39:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh.. something to look forward to :)
2019-01-07T22:39:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if your big branch does manage to do a large refactoring of the prefs framework, it's something we should look into as well.
2019-01-07T22:43:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, it's a big question right now how much of that will get done
2019-01-07T22:43:54  <Bosmon> I got wrongfooted just before Christmas by the "template rendering" thing that looked a lot like a resourceLoader built for the compositePanel
2019-01-07T22:44:16  <Bosmon> But I realised that this is nothing to do with an actual resourceLoader, it is just "something else" that stores a bunch of templates in an option named "resources"

2019-01-07T22:44:29  <Bosmon> So I managed to keep everything working with pretty minimal changes so far
2019-01-07T22:44:57  <Bosmon> I did rename the use of "resourceText" in these many historical cases where it was inaccurate - for example where it refers to something that is no longer text but has already been parsed as JSON or XML
2019-01-07T22:50:01  <Justin_o> thanks, that will help with a lot of confusion down the line i think
2019-01-07T22:54:13  <sgithens> Has anyone tried using VIrtualBox 6 on macOS with our vagrant setup yet?
