2019-10-04T10:27:09  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I'm starting to see these types of errors pretty often: rec.event.removeListener
2019-10-04T10:27:14  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry
2019-10-04T10:27:15  <the-t-in-rtf> TypeError: rec.event.removeListener is not a function
2019-10-04T10:28:22  <the-t-in-rtf> If you refresh the gpii-handlebars pull in progress, here's a handy block to set a breakpoint in: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/blob/c14d795ca61c711b54fa8d63e51736fba8ca3907/tests/browser-fixtures/js/tests-renderer-serverResourceAware.js#L190
2019-10-04T10:29:01  <the-t-in-rtf> When I first saw it I worked around by calling fluid.destroy myself, but now it seems I need to call destroy wrapped in a try/catch block.
2019-10-04T10:29:39  <the-t-in-rtf> This is about the third repo I'm updating to use the latest potentia-ii Infusion where I've seen some variation on this.

2019-10-04T11:47:02  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you shouldn't ever need to call fluid.destroy by yourself
2019-10-04T11:47:06  <Bosmon> What is on the stack frame when this happens?
2019-10-04T11:51:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Let me dig for a moment, the latest tests are webdriver ones, which complicates the troubleshooting
2019-10-04T11:51:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I think if you comment out the stop sequence in those tests you should see the error.
2019-10-04T11:55:26  <the-t-in-rtf> Let me put it in a gist or something
2019-10-04T11:56:34  <the-t-in-rtf> https://pastebin.com/ChKfAr2h
2019-10-04T11:56:47  <the-t-in-rtf> Jeez their Captcha is just awful
2019-10-04T11:56:54  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, there it is.
2019-10-04T12:00:05  <the-t-in-rtf> if you comment out the stop sequence, you should see the context in the gpii-handlebars browser tests
2019-10-04T12:00:33  <the-t-in-rtf> it starts complaining about jqUnit start being called again at the end of the first test run, and displays the error at the start of the second test run
2019-10-04T12:07:53  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that won't be the location of the first error
2019-10-04T12:07:58  <Bosmon> See if you can track it down more accurately

2019-10-04T16:44:53  <colinclark> greatislander: Just for context, I’m largely editing for brevity at this point—I love what we’ve got
2019-10-04T16:45:14  <greatislander> colinclark sounds good!
2019-10-04T16:46:22  <colinclark> still 33 words over
2019-10-04T16:49:55  <colinclark> I love the “The outcome…” paragraph
2019-10-04T16:51:00  <colinclark> down to 23 over
2019-10-04T16:53:54  <colinclark> greatislander, cherylhjli: maybe take another look? somehow i added an extra word. we’re close; 224 words right now
2019-10-04T16:55:39  <greatislander> colinclark I am getting 198 words!
2019-10-04T16:55:52  <greatislander> Having accepted all your suggestions :)
2019-10-04T16:56:11  <colinclark> oh wow
2019-10-04T16:56:16  <colinclark> how did i miscount?
2019-10-04T16:56:26  <greatislander> I think the wordcount double counts if you have suggestions that aren't accepted
2019-10-04T16:56:31  <greatislander> e.g. it counts the before and after
2019-10-04T16:56:37  <greatislander> but who knows
2019-10-04T16:56:40  <colinclark> yeah, 196 now
2019-10-04T16:56:47  <colinclark> if there are four words you really miss here, feel free to add them :)
2019-10-04T16:57:06  <greatislander> I think it looks great-- cherylhjli jhung michelled want to give a last pass? Then I can send to Trebor & Michael
2019-10-04T16:58:06  <colinclark> thanks for your help greatislander
2019-10-04T16:59:22  <michelled> nice! I like it a lot!
2019-10-04T16:59:51  <greatislander> my pleasure!

2019-10-04T17:01:43  <colinclark> I’m not sure the answer to it
2019-10-04T17:01:55  <colinclark> Do we want to bill this as being about our project? Or is our project just one of the contributors?

2019-10-04T17:07:27  <cherylhjli> colinclark I like the idea of again getting away from the idea that we're the centralized hub - perhaps we can "host" aka initiate and facilitate, and be a contributor, but not necessarily be about our project
2019-10-04T17:08:28  <colinclark>  right, that makes sense

2019-10-04T17:08:36  <colinclark> “hosting” is great, and works perfectly with our metaphor
2019-10-04T17:08:56  <colinclark> so the question is just if our title should be slightly different, or not
2019-10-04T17:09:01  <colinclark> i dunno :)
2019-10-04T17:10:40  <greatislander> I like your suggested title change colinclark
2019-10-04T17:10:58  <greatislander> "Designing technologies for the cooperative ecosystem"
2019-10-04T17:14:06  <colinclark> I’ll leave it to you and cherylhjli
