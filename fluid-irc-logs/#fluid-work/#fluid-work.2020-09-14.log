2020-09-14T12:36:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: update on FLUID-6538. I went to lint my current work and ran into an issue with our version of eslint not supporting async/await. I should have remember this because I ran into that in work on an extension for APCP. Which is why I had filed https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/issues/14
2020-09-14T12:37:28  <Justin_o> So I'm looking into that now too, and ran into another issue.. which I had encountered when looking into this a while back, which is that jsdoc validation has been deprecated. It throws a bunch of warnings now. So I'm going to remove that fluid-eslint-config and maybe make a new shareable config that can be mixed in on top for configuring a jsdoc validation plugin for eslint. I've filed that under
2020-09-14T12:37:28  <Justin_o> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6548
2020-09-14T12:37:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - this is something we should consider together with the-t-in-rtf
2020-09-14T12:38:05  <Bosmon> I'm puzzled that JSDoc validation has been deprecated
2020-09-14T12:38:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/valid-jsdoc
2020-09-14T12:39:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this might be a better link https://eslint.org/blog/2018/11/jsdoc-end-of-life
2020-09-14T12:40:24  <Bosmon> Yes, I see
2020-09-14T12:40:29  <Bosmon> It seems we need to adopt this plugin
2020-09-14T12:40:54  <Bosmon> Wow there's been a lot of releases of ESLint since this happened : P
2020-09-14T12:41:37  <Justin_o> it shouldn't be too difficult, but maybe you can review the recommended settings for the plugin. I'm just modifying a few things to keep the names of types and using "return" instead of "returns" like we currently have configured. And picking up the recommended settings otherwise
2020-09-14T12:41:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. it's been a while.
2020-09-14T12:45:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also another thing with eslint plugins is that can't really be shared through the shareable config, so the consumer of that shared config will need to manually install the plugin. I'm not sure, and maybe the-t-in-rtf can confirm, but it might be enough to just have fluid-grunt-lint-all include the plugin.
2020-09-14T14:26:24  <Justin_o> danielcho: hello
2020-09-14T14:26:36  <Justin_o> sorry, danielcho wrong auto complete, didn't mean to ping you.
2020-09-14T14:26:41  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: hello
2020-09-14T14:26:42  <danielcho> no worries :)
2020-09-14T14:27:19  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Hi
2020-09-14T14:31:49  <dmahajan980> Just saw your reply on the mail thread. I'll send the updated description in a few minutes.
2020-09-14T14:33:03  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: if you want to send me a zip file to test out before update and create new releases you can do that too. Then if that works, we can do the new release and I'll use the zip from that to actually do the release.
2020-09-14T14:37:29  <Uttara> philip: do you want me meet after the standup?
2020-09-14T14:37:53  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Thanks, that sounds great. I'll follow up with you next time before creating any new release.
2020-09-14T14:38:44  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: sounds good.. just figure it would save you some time. It's unfortunate that there isn't a better way. Actually you could try to use web-ext https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext
2020-09-14T14:39:24  <Justin_o> I used it in this package. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-open-same-tab-extension
2020-09-14T14:49:57  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Sorry! I missed your messages.
2020-09-14T14:50:36  <dmahajan980> Thanks for sharing the package. I'll check that out shortly.
2020-09-14T14:51:16  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Also, I've sent you the updated description. Kindly check that out.
2020-09-14T14:52:03  <dmahajan980> If there's any other issue you face during publishing, please let me know.
2020-09-14T14:58:57  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2020-09-14T15:00:04  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: sorry, I actually meant the description within the manifest file.
2020-09-14T15:00:22  <Justin_o> I'm unable to upload the package at all because of this.
2020-09-14T15:00:54  <dmahajan980> Oh! I see. Give me a few minutes.
2020-09-14T15:00:59  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-09-14T15:21:34  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Here's the updated release: https://github.com/fluid-lab/gamepad-navigator/releases/tag/v0.1.1-dev
2020-09-14T15:21:42  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: thanks
2020-09-14T15:24:49  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Thanks to you for working out on this and the-t-in_ for reviewing the pull in such a short time.
2020-09-14T15:25:33  <dmahajan980> By the way, please use the old details for the web store listing (in case you're referring to the ones I sent a few minutes ago).
2020-09-14T15:26:04  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: this version uploaded to the store :) I'll use the old details for filling out the fields for the web store.
2020-09-14T15:28:26  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: That's great! Is there any verification process, or do they list the extension immediately after submitting?
2020-09-14T15:30:44  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: if there are permissions requested they will need to review before it is fully published. I believe that will be the case for this extension.
2020-09-14T15:31:17  <Justin_o> It could take up to several weeks for the review, but it's been about a day for the UIO+, although that had already been published before and the last was just an updated.
2020-09-14T15:31:19  <Justin_o> update
2020-09-14T15:40:33  <dmahajan980> I see, that might take some good amount of time. But I'm happy and excited for the extension getting published :D
2020-09-14T15:43:29  <Justin_o> danielcho: hello, this message is actually for you ;) do you happen to have any experience with React Native?
2020-09-14T15:43:37  <Justin_o> sbates: ^
2020-09-14T15:49:06  <danielcho> Justin_o: we looked into React native in the early stage of C2LC project, but not in details
2020-09-14T15:49:44  <danielcho> just tested how we could import a sample react project into IOS, I remember
2020-09-14T15:51:53  <sbates> Justin_o: as danielcho said, we looked into React Native a little when looking at technology options but didn't go very far with it
2020-09-14T16:02:27  <Justin_o> danielcho, sbates: okay, thanks. I'm just going to look into seeing if it's possible to integrate UIO into it. If you have thoughts on this please share. I've done some preliminary investigation at this point, just going through the tutorial, but that's about it.
2020-09-14T16:28:45  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: hello, I also need the justification for the host permissions.
2020-09-14T16:29:01  <Justin_o> https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns
2020-09-14T16:38:16  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Hi, would a short statement work, like the justification for other permissions?
2020-09-14T16:38:31  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: yes, should be enough
2020-09-14T16:38:47  <dmahajan980> Cool. Just a moment.
2020-09-14T16:39:09  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: by the way "A host permission is any match pattern specified in the "permissions" and "content_scripts" fields of the extension manifest"
2020-09-14T16:39:18  <Justin_o> not sure if the link I sent before made that clear
2020-09-14T16:39:47  <dmahajan980> Yes, I read on that through the link your sent.
2020-09-14T16:45:00  <dmahajan980> Justion_o: Please check your email.
2020-09-14T16:45:07  <dmahajan980> Justin_o ^
2020-09-14T16:45:42  <dmahajan980> Sorry, that was a typing error.
2020-09-14T16:53:53  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: I've submitted the extension for review. Thanks :)
2020-09-14T16:54:37  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Amazing! Thanks for helping us with that :)
2020-09-14T16:55:02  <dmahajan980> I'm super excited.
2020-09-14T16:55:03  <Justin_o> no problem, happy to help.
2020-09-14T16:58:25  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: thanks for all the works you've done on this project :)
2020-09-14T17:00:49  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: You're very welcome. It's been a lot of fun.
2020-09-14T17:02:43  <dmahajan980> Wouldn't have been possible without the-t-in_, you, and other community members.
2020-09-14T17:21:46  <Justin_o> :)
