2019-10-11T08:08:58  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there! Good morning Bosmon !
2019-10-11T08:21:53  <Bosmon> Morning javjarfer[m]!
2019-10-11T08:23:04  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~yanachkov@185.97.75.80> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2019-10-11T08:35:44  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Hi! I wanted to talk you some changes I need to make to the XMLSettingsHandler because we need to support array-like settings
2019-10-11T08:36:57  <javjarfer[m]> I have been taking a look to it, and my best guess, is that, those settings needs to be in separate configure blocks, with special options
2019-10-11T08:37:08  <javjarfer[m]> how do you feel about that?
2019-10-11T08:37:51  <javjarfer[m]> the problem basically is that you need to generate the XML entries for the array, not just "accessing" the values, so you need to have the XML tags to be used placed somewhere
2019-10-11T08:46:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - can you give an example of such a setting?
2019-10-11T08:47:04  <Bosmon> For what solution will this be implemented?
2019-10-11T08:48:01  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  "ApplicationSettings.Speech.ScreenReadingItems.$t" from Read&Write is a setting that accepts a XML array as input, specifying the elements that the screen reader should read
2019-10-11T08:48:59  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - can't this be done by just including a schema structure in the settingsHandler "options"?

2019-10-11T08:52:13  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  but that would mean that in the options block I need to specify data for a specific setting
2019-10-11T08:52:23  <javjarfer[m]> or for all the array settings in the solution
2019-10-11T08:53:23  <javjarfer[m]> the schema structure could be something like { "arraySettingId": setting, "xmlTags": [tags] }
2019-10-11T08:57:02  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - it looks to me that this really needs to be done via transformations
2019-10-11T08:57:06  <Bosmon> That is what the system was built fot
2019-10-11T08:57:06  <Bosmon> for
2019-10-11T09:00:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: so, I would need to expose the setting through a transform that receives an array of strings, and produce an XML array?
2019-10-11T09:00:50  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, at least an XML array in the JSON-equivalent form accepted by the settingsHandler, yes
2019-10-11T09:01:08  <Bosmon> We already have transforms a bit like this, but this one would be a touch more elaborate
2019-10-11T09:01:49  <Bosmon> In fact many of these were generated precisely to deal with such recalcitrant XML data: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#fluidtransformsarraytosetmembership
2019-10-11T09:01:57  <Bosmon> We puzzled over why KASPARNETT ever wrote this one : P
2019-10-11T09:02:33  <Bosmon> Ah, actually this one is even more XML-y: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#creates-an-object-indexed-with-keys-from-array-entries-fluidtransformsindexarraybykey

2019-10-11T09:03:18  <Bosmon> Your strange client : P
2019-10-11T09:05:54  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: those transforms look really useful, I need to take a look to their impls, they will be a good guide for sure for this new one
2019-10-11T09:06:18  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - cool
2019-10-11T09:06:33  <Bosmon> You can channel the ghost of long-departed KASPARDNIETT
2019-10-11T09:06:42  <Bosmon> KASPARD the FRIENDLY GHOST
2019-10-11T09:10:39  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: xddd I would make a spiritual visit to him through Skype; which feels pretty appropriate, because Skype user experience is like going back to the past
2019-10-11T09:55:13  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - not now they have updated it to an electron app : P
2019-10-11T10:03:34  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: A new mask!!
2019-10-11T10:04:31  <Bosmon> I only wish the user experience WAS like going back to the past
2019-10-11T10:05:07  <Bosmon> I kept managing to use Skype 6 for years by means of creating a read-only zero byte file named "SkypeSetup.exe"
2019-10-11T10:05:11  <javjarfer[m]> Also, sorry Bosmon I have submitted another pull regarding the Windows 10 magnifier, since a setting was recently added to the requirements for it, but it was down in my priorities and I didn't tackle it until today
2019-10-11T10:05:22  <Bosmon> But they have eventually banned this client from the network
2019-10-11T10:05:35  <Bosmon> Thanks, javjarfer[m]
2019-10-11T10:05:38  <javjarfer[m]> I kept managing to use Skype 6 for years by means of creating a read-only zero byte file named "SkypeSetup.exe"
2019-10-11T10:05:39  <javjarfer[m]> HAHA really?
2019-10-11T10:05:50  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - this was a fully effective technique!
2019-10-11T10:06:47  <javjarfer[m]> I believe you! You know you are doing it right when your users fill a binary with zeroes to stop you from updating your software
