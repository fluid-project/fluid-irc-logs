2020-03-06T12:15:49  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @Shahda.   Most of our work is specifically written using Infusion, you should look at that.
2020-03-06T12:16:36  <the-t-in-rtf> You should also look at Chrome Extension tutorials to see if that seems like something you can handle.
2020-03-06T12:16:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Not that we'd use that, but it's a candidate, and is a good indication of the level of technical depth you'd need to have.
2020-03-06T12:17:12  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, if you haven't done so already, It's also a really good idea to read up on our community practices
2020-03-06T12:18:00  <the-t-in-rtf> One of the mentors just updated our help page, there's lots of good links there:
2020-03-06T12:18:01  <the-t-in-rtf> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-03-06T12:18:41  <the-t-in-rtf> Reading up on the community in general is also useful.

2020-03-06T16:01:22  <nefeli> @the-t-in-rtf For the application proposal, is a design solution targeted at a specific group sufficient or are you looking for a more general interface between the controllers and the navigation keys?
2020-03-06T16:01:59  *** kasparnet <kasparnet!~kasper2@192038133104.mbb.telenor.dk> has joined #fluid-work
2020-03-06T16:05:07  <the-t-in-rtf> The core use case is browsing using a web browser, which I had imagined doing using navigation keys.
2020-03-06T16:05:20  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, navigating while using a web browser
2020-03-06T16:05:35  <the-t-in-rtf> But others have pointed out things like mouse emulation, which a controller like the Steam Controller does
2020-03-06T16:05:48  <the-t-in-rtf> and there are solutions like that that work with any program, not just a browser
2020-03-06T16:06:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I'd say that it's likely that we'd focus on navigation in a browser, but that we're not trying to intentionally exclude other uses if we can help it
2020-03-06T16:07:39  <the-t-in-rtf> that's part of what we'd explore in the project, seeing what things can accept input from a gamepad, seeing how they can translate that into keyboard/mouse inputs, and in what context
2020-03-06T16:09:52  <nefeli> the-t-in-rtf: I see from a technical perspective it is quite open and that is very nice. From a more human-based perspective is this solution (using a controller) targeted to a specific group of people? (for example people with parkinsons) or is it again open?
2020-03-06T16:10:14  <the-t-in-rtf> it's open, but in part I picked game pads because there is a lot of work to make them open to a range of peole
2020-03-06T16:10:27  <the-t-in-rtf> for example, the Microsoft Adaptive Xbox Controller
2020-03-06T16:10:48  <the-t-in-rtf> but they're also so inexpensive and widely available that people make their own solutions out of used controllers.
2020-03-06T16:11:05  <the-t-in-rtf> (gamepads in general, I mean)
2020-03-06T16:11:28  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean that there is a lot of work that has already been done to make them open
2020-03-06T16:11:37  <the-t-in-rtf> and we can build on that
2020-03-06T16:11:48  <the-t-in-rtf> by making it possible to control a browser in addition to playing games
2020-03-06T16:16:43  <nefeli> I see it makes a lot of sense to move it towards that direction.
2020-03-06T16:19:44  <the-t-in-rtf> Check out Ben Heck's one handed controllers on YouTube for an example of what I mean about modifying an existing controller.
2020-03-06T16:19:58  <the-t-in-rtf> There are also similar kits you can buy and premodified ones.
2020-03-06T16:20:35  <nefeli> Making a browser extension seems to be straight-forward enough and I see you also propose the use of  electron for creating a cross-platform desktop app. Do you plan on having that app "feeding" the keys from the controler input?

2020-03-06T16:22:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I honestly don't know, that's part of what we'd figure out
2020-03-06T16:22:54  <the-t-in-rtf> what will allow us to read the gamepad inputs and then send the keys to a browser
2020-03-06T16:23:05  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe a chrome extension is enough
2020-03-06T16:24:13  <the-t-in-rtf> but if an electron window gives us the ability to control all browsers, then maybe we'd go that way
2020-03-06T16:26:13  <nefeli> Great then I checked the one handed controller example. It is a rather smart idea and a mouse simulation could work in a similar way.
2020-03-06T16:27:27  <nefeli> I am trying to figure out how extended should the application be.
2020-03-06T16:29:50  <nefeli> Is a concept enough or should I add a code diagram and UI mockup?
2020-03-06T16:30:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I think writing up your thoughts is enough
2020-03-06T16:30:18  <the-t-in-rtf> it's also very important to get to know the community and especially Infusion
2020-03-06T16:30:59  <the-t-in-rtf> so write up your ideas and share them, some candidates wrote blog posts, others posted to the mailing list
2020-03-06T16:31:01  <the-t-in-rtf> that's fine
2020-03-06T16:31:28  <nefeli> great then thanks a lot for the information

2020-03-06T22:47:55  <gmoss> batey96: we can discuss in here for the benefit of people who are not present. Pretty much everyone is off for the weekend right now :)

2020-03-06T22:48:39  <gmoss> batey96: I'm going to try to reproduce your issue right now by building the site from scratch. Can you tell me what version of Node you're using?
2020-03-06T22:49:39  <batey96> i tried with v10.48
2020-03-06T22:52:47  <batey96> v0.10.48 i mean to say and then switched to v12

2020-03-06T22:56:18  <gmoss> batey96: okay, I'm running v10.15.3. I believe Docpad requires an older version of Node to run properly, I'm trying to remember the details . This is the main reason we would like to move away from Docpad :)
2020-03-06T22:56:47  <gmoss> I'm also getting errors on run and then Docpad shutting down
2020-03-06T22:57:11  <batey96> did some googling on the docpad project and its been dropped off for mainatinants

2020-03-06T23:04:23  <batey96> can i cleanup the project still with the Docpad while waiting for gsoc implementation??
2020-03-06T23:04:47  <gmoss> batey96: yes, it doesn't seem like it's being maintained. I think it would be good to hold off for now
2020-03-06T23:08:06  <batey96> okay.how do i go about doing something reasonable as contribution to the inclusive design institute(floe and fluid projects) to outstand myself for this gsoc
2020-03-06T23:09:29  <gmoss> batey96: it isn't required that we get a local instance the old version of the site working before moving ahead with the gsoc implementation.
2020-03-06T23:09:29  <gmoss> at this stage it would be better to familiarize yourself with the content of the two sites, learn about different static site generators if you haven't already, and look at a couple of our other sites that currently use Hugo (there are links on the wiki page)
2020-03-06T23:09:54  <gmoss> if you haven't started working on your application, I would also recommend doing so :)
2020-03-06T23:11:02  <batey96> okay thanks alot for the pointers gmoss
