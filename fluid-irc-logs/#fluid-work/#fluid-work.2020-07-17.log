2020-07-17T12:23:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @gtirloni, wondered if you'd started using services or found anything that might help with getting a CouchDB service set up as part of a GitHub Actions workflow.
2020-07-17T13:10:55  <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: morning, I haven't used services yet but I have a use case that might need them. I'm not at home right now.. but I'll try it later and report back (sorry for duplicated messages, cellphone coverage here is terrible)
2020-07-17T13:13:56  <the-t-in-rtf> it's cool.
2020-07-17T13:14:06  <the-t-in-rtf> if you want to pair on it and try things early next week, that'd be great
2020-07-17T13:26:09  <sbates> Justin_o, gmoss: am I right in remembering that Gregor you are going to talk about commit messages at our Tue and Thu discussions?
2020-07-17T13:26:58  <sbates> I know I said that I preferred not to host a topic, but I had a related topic that I thought it might be interesting to discuss, that I could facilitate
2020-07-17T13:27:15  <sbates> and that is git history management
2020-07-17T13:31:46  <sbates> is history a record of every working commit? or is history reworked to organize the work into completed parts? does one use merge commits, squashed merge commits, or history rewriting tools such as commit --amend and rebase
2020-07-17T13:34:13  <sbates> and how that is related to tooling such as GitHub Pull Requests vs a patch submission workflow
2020-07-17T13:38:55  <sbates> and tools for viewing git history
2020-07-17T15:05:57  <gmoss> sbates: I was going to limit my talk to the messages only :) it's scheduled for the 30th. I'm interested in one on history management as well, considering our recent discussion of it on the mailing list

2020-07-17T18:09:44  <Uttara> Cindyli and Teddy__ : Do we have a open ticket for the font sized? Me and Lisa just finished finalizing the new sizes so I was wondering if I should submit a new ticket
2020-07-17T18:10:14  <cindyli> Uttara: here's the ticket for it - https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/322
2020-07-17T18:10:20  <cindyli> you don't need to create a new one
