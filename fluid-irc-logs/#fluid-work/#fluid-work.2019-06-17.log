2019-06-17T08:44:36  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens and @bosmon, in much of my integration work, I follow the opposite strategy, i.e. retrieve all records to be updated from a view, transform them, and then assemble them together in a form that can be used with CouchDB's bulk update.

2019-06-17T11:32:53  <javjarfer[m]> hey the-t-in-rtf, I'm back today
2019-06-17T11:33:00  <javjarfer[m]> is there any results of you last week meeting I can read??
2019-06-17T11:33:35  <the-t-in-rtf> we ended up not meeting
2019-06-17T11:33:45  <the-t-in-rtf> my son's childcare fell through unexpectedly.
2019-06-17T11:34:08  <the-t-in-rtf> and then we needed to focus on the performance of universal
2019-06-17T11:34:23  <the-t-in-rtf> while you were out we had to roll back the deployment because the new endpoints were slower
2019-06-17T11:34:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm working on that at the moment
2019-06-17T11:34:44  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully we'll get back to the LSR work once that's addressed
2019-06-17T11:39:39  <javjarfer[m]> oh, I see, thanks for the update, working in performance stuff is cool always tho
2019-06-17T11:52:37  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, last week we talked about there being a fluid.resolveRootSingle grade that would handle the caching of compiled templates.  Is it acceptable for this to be created automatically when requiring gpii-json-schema itself?
2019-06-17T11:52:53  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. for there always to be a cache even if no one is using it.
2019-06-17T11:53:03  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes
2019-06-17T11:53:28  <the-t-in-rtf> great, there's still the issue of including it on the client side, but that should make most things easier.
2019-06-17T11:53:42  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks.

2019-06-17T14:36:02  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss. having a lookâ€¦

2019-06-17T15:28:23  <gmoss> cindyli: hmm.. I think I've seen that before. the JS is running before jQuery is ready, I suppose, but it's likely something related to my code rather than jQuery itself
2019-06-17T15:28:54  <cindyli> also, the learningReflections theme is linked with "introduction.html" (https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blob/SJRK-237/src/server/serverSetup.js#L146) that doesn't exist in "./themes/learningReflections" or "./themes/base" directory. if you change this line to:
2019-06-17T15:28:55  <cindyli> index: "html/introduction.html"
2019-06-17T15:29:11  <cindyli> the intro page will be served with the same error
