2019-06-11T11:44:21  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, all, just labeling body parts in the existing solutions registry before its upcoming surgery.
2019-06-11T11:44:50  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], @stegru, @Bosmon, I think we could actually collapse single-setting entries like this back into a combined Windows entry:
2019-06-11T11:44:51  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4263b14b24f747c7aff59d747d27ce27d2bc6d4c/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4745
2019-06-11T11:44:56  <the-t-in-rtf> That's for brightness
2019-06-11T11:45:52  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't see anything that would prevent us from collapsing that down into a single-entry settings handler block within a combined windows solution.
2019-06-11T11:47:18  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, we can leave it for now, just educating myself about things that might potentially be possible to clean up
2019-06-11T11:49:17  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - but it is a single-entry settings handler block
2019-06-11T11:49:22  <Bosmon> How are you imagining it might be collapsed?
2019-06-11T11:49:34  <the-t-in-rtf> making a combined windows entry with multiple settings handler blocks
2019-06-11T11:50:05  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - how would the matchmaker then choose whether to activate this one solution or not?
2019-06-11T11:50:24  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, so it's about how we launch them
2019-06-11T11:50:34  <Bosmon> Well, that is sort of what the SR is about, yes : P
2019-06-11T11:50:34  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. they have to be separate entries for that specific reason
2019-06-11T11:50:48  <the-t-in-rtf> well, we could combine the ones that never need to be launched
2019-06-11T11:51:02  <Bosmon> What solutions might we have that might never need to be launched........
2019-06-11T11:51:28  <the-t-in-rtf> desktop background
2019-06-11T11:51:30  <the-t-in-rtf> scroll down
2019-06-11T11:51:33  <the-t-in-rtf> next entry
2019-06-11T11:51:37  <the-t-in-rtf> it's always installed
2019-06-11T11:51:58  <the-t-in-rtf> well, two entries down
2019-06-11T11:52:23  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, even that one the configure block is distinct
2019-06-11T11:52:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll leave it for now, just looking around for patterns at this point
2019-06-11T11:52:57  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - whether it has an "installed" block or not isn't relevant to whether the matchmaker can decide to activate it individually or n ot
2019-06-11T11:53:49  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but desktop background colour is still a good example of what I mean
2019-06-11T11:53:55  <the-t-in-rtf> it has no launch handler either
2019-06-11T11:54:10  <Bosmon> Yes, "launch" perhaps wasn't the most accurate term to use
2019-06-11T11:54:45  <Bosmon> I guess we should remind ourselves whether the current matchmaker is intelligent enough to avoid activating settings handlers for which all the inputs have been transformed away
2019-06-11T11:54:52  <Bosmon> I guess it probably is, with cindyli's recent work
2019-06-11T11:55:09  <Bosmon> In any case, I'd be very surprised to find entries in the SR which could be coalesced
2019-06-11T11:56:17  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I should explain that I'm thinking of adding the capability to deliver different schemas for different purposes
2019-06-11T11:56:20  <the-t-in-rtf> obviously, validation
2019-06-11T11:56:50  <the-t-in-rtf> but for example we might want to display all settings for a solution at once regardless of which settings handler they belong to
2019-06-11T11:57:09  <the-t-in-rtf> so that someone like Steve is just working with a list of settings rather than having to group them by how they are configured
2019-06-11T11:57:34  <the-t-in-rtf> so I'm thinking about how we might reorganise material in general
2019-06-11T11:57:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I think you're right about the current solutions needing to stay distinct
2019-06-11T12:02:54  <the-t-in-rtf> right now we have something that just iterates through that part of the solution definition: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/b4353e0f9f9c66ca4d79a7b0a11668fa9dc75269/gpii/node_modules/solutionsRegistry/src/js/generate-schemas.js#L64
2019-06-11T12:03:45  <the-t-in-rtf> if we are to componentise settings handlers and settings, we need a strategy for gathering up and organising sub-component-provided material
2019-06-11T12:07:08  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm thinking that a solution might operate a bit like express and make a register of its descendant settings, which it can deliver back to answer the question "what settings do I support"
2019-06-11T12:07:37  <the-t-in-rtf> but it seems like we will need something new to require that there be at least one settingsHandler component, at least one setting component within that.

2019-06-11T12:08:38  <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps some way of representing the material within a schema definition that will be provided by a child component
2019-06-11T12:09:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I will keep sketching, it'll definitely take until Thursday to have something digested enough to discuss

2019-06-11T12:27:05  <the-t-in-rtf> so, completely separate question, why doesn't JAWS have a restore and configure block?  is there some kind of default acton that takes place when a custom restore and configure block aren't defined for a solution?
2019-06-11T12:27:36  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4263b14b24f747c7aff59d747d27ce27d2bc6d4c/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L2
2019-06-11T12:27:50  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because I was wondering if the solutions schema validation was missing something.
2019-06-11T12:28:00  <the-t-in-rtf> even the noSettings handler has an empty array for those
2019-06-11T12:29:16  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4263b14b24f747c7aff59d747d27ce27d2bc6d4c/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L11772
2019-06-11T12:29:32  <the-t-in-rtf> And then there are some that just seem to blindly list all of their settings handlers for each block.
2019-06-11T12:29:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask in part because if I am going to model settings handlers as components, we have the option to generate boilerplate like this by default
2019-06-11T12:34:50  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/93e00ab5a36f4895c38943045bd728212269cabb/documentation/SolutionsRegistryFormat.md#lifecycle-blocks-configure-restore-start-stop-update-and-isrunning
2019-06-11T12:34:59  <the-t-in-rtf> So, that's the docs, if it's omitted, all are called.
2019-06-11T12:35:18  <the-t-in-rtf> so I assume that we could safely lose the ones that basically do the default themselves (digs for example)
2019-06-11T12:36:07  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4263b14b24f747c7aff59d747d27ce27d2bc6d4c/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4783
2019-06-11T12:36:09  <the-t-in-rtf> like that one

2019-06-11T12:38:56  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, I believe there are default configure and restore actions
2019-06-11T12:39:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I rubbed my own nose in the docs
2019-06-11T12:39:27  <the-t-in-rtf> my question is now, what about the ones that appear to ape the defaults
2019-06-11T12:39:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume I could safely clean those up while the patient is under the knife
2019-06-11T12:41:06  <the-t-in-rtf> and other boilerplate such as launchers: ["launchers.launcher"]
2019-06-11T12:41:28  <the-t-in-rtf> I may just comment out the suspicious stuff and run the tests overnight
2019-06-11T12:41:46  <the-t-in-rtf> my theory is that we can lose a lot of belts and/or braces that we don't then have to carry around into the new paradigm.
2019-06-11T12:42:28  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, I mean start: ["launchers.launcher"]
2019-06-11T12:43:26  <the-t-in-rtf> OMG, maybe we should use the windows onboarding meeting this week to review some of these
2019-06-11T12:43:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, this seems very wrong: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/4263b14b24f747c7aff59d747d27ce27d2bc6d4c/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6219
2019-06-11T12:44:07  <the-t-in-rtf> both "isInstalled" and "start" call the launcher
2019-06-11T12:44:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess one is a harmless noop or something?
2019-06-11T12:44:30  <the-t-in-rtf> presumably "start"
2019-06-11T12:44:37  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean it'd be very bad if it were the other way round
2019-06-11T12:44:44  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. checking to see if it's installed starts it
2019-06-11T12:45:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if everyone else is game maybe that's a good use of the windows meeting tomorrow
2019-06-11T12:45:40  <the-t-in-rtf> or part of it
2019-06-11T12:46:18  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, isRunning
2019-06-11T12:46:33  <the-t-in-rtf> still seems a little off
