2020-05-14T16:15:13  <gmoss> greatislander: the word you used to describe these icons was "inscrutable", right? I agree
2020-05-14T16:15:26  <greatislander> yep
2020-05-14T16:15:31  <greatislander> it's very weird
2020-05-14T16:15:52  <greatislander> I personally find reading the raw RDF data easier to interpret, which is… maybe a bad sign
2020-05-14T16:17:10  <gmoss> greatislander: yeah that doesn't bode well for their UI
2020-05-14T16:17:41  <greatislander> colinclark has some theories about the UI being automatically generated from the data in some fashion, which might explain things a bit
2020-05-14T16:19:05  <colinclark> greatislander: hahaha
2020-05-14T16:21:17  <colinclark> the world’s most unreadable data format, more comprehensible than the UI used to render it
