2018-11-21T10:14:58  <Bosmon> Does it seem to work ok?
2018-11-21T10:15:09  <jhernandez> testing it right now
2018-11-21T10:15:12  <Bosmon> Other than the failed CI of course :)
2018-11-21T10:15:16  <Bosmon> Awesome
2018-11-21T10:16:23  <jhernandez> oh, didn't realize
2018-11-21T10:16:26  <jhernandez> stupid CI
2018-11-21T10:16:27  <jhernandez> :P
2018-11-21T10:22:24  <jhernandez> okay, it seems to be working fine but I want to build an installer and test that there are no surprises when the app is packaged
2018-11-21T10:24:39  <Bosmon> brilliant, jhernandez
2018-11-21T10:27:02  <jhernandez> CI failed again, it's throwing a 503 when trying to install nodejs via chocolatey, so I'll wait a few minutes before triggering the test again

2018-11-21T12:18:10  <jhernandez> this is, everything seems to be working fine, tested all the settings in the QSS, kyed in with a key, performed changes and tested that it saves to the cloud, restoring to standard works, usb user listener is working fine ...
2018-11-21T12:18:35  <jhernandez> let's SHIP IT
2018-11-21T12:20:27  <jhernandez> it's already pointing to the last dev release of windows that I created earlier
2018-11-21T12:24:28  <Bosmon> jhernandez - sounds great
2018-11-21T12:24:36  <Bosmon> Really good work
2018-11-21T12:29:02  <jhernandez> I guess we all wanted to see this update happening
2018-11-21T12:30:49  <jhernandez> kudos for all involved, specially to the Astea team for their careful testing of electron 3
2018-11-21T12:32:03  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I notice that all our Windows vagrant boxes have expired
2018-11-21T12:32:10  <Bosmon> Is it alfredo responsible for building these?
2018-11-21T12:32:41  <jhernandez> yes
2018-11-21T12:32:51  <jhernandez> in fact he's already building them
2018-11-21T12:33:02  <jhernandez> I guess they will be available soon

2018-11-21T12:34:05  <jhernandez> that's the pipeline ;)
2018-11-21T12:35:46  <Bosmon> jhernandez - wow, awesome!
2018-11-21T12:35:58  <Bosmon> Such miraculous technology
2018-11-21T12:36:47  <Bosmon> Very odd-looking pipeline
2018-11-21T12:36:57  <Bosmon> It looks like all the x86 tasks depend on the x64 ones
2018-11-21T12:37:07  <Bosmon> I guess it's just that we want the x64 ones done first...
2018-11-21T12:37:12  <jhernandez> yeah .... but it's there
2018-11-21T12:37:17  <jhernandez> dunno

2018-11-21T13:07:29  <gtirloni> alanharnum: ^^ not sure if we need new vbox images as well, I think the fix is entirely on the hypervisor side of things (i.e. guest additions might not be playing a role there), so updating the CI node might be enough

2018-11-21T13:08:55  <georgit> Hey, stegru. I left a comment about the tray icon PoC that you created: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3540?focusedCommentId=35810&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-35810
2018-11-21T13:09:11  <stegru> yes georgit - I read it
2018-11-21T13:09:24  <jhernandez> georgit: stegru now that you're talking about that
2018-11-21T13:09:35  <stegru> in fact, I don't think you will have anything to worry about
2018-11-21T13:09:56  <jhernandez> stegru: ?
2018-11-21T13:10:56  <georgit> stegru: What do you have in mind regarding the IPC between your app and the GPII app?
2018-11-21T13:11:51  <stegru> well, I was originally going to use the same thing that electron does to display the tray icon... meaning there would be very little work involved for gpii-app
2018-11-21T13:13:15  <stegru> I might not put it in a separate process, but I don't really want to write it in node
2018-11-21T13:14:01  <stegru> but anyway, to receive events (like click), it will be received in the same way the tray icon gets them
2018-11-21T13:14:06  <stegru> so no extra work for that
2018-11-21T13:16:31  <georgit> stegru: I am confused
2018-11-21T13:16:44  <stegru> good
2018-11-21T13:16:59  <stegru> with anything in particular?
2018-11-21T13:18:09  <javjarfer[m]> Hi Bosmon !
2018-11-21T13:18:42  <javjarfer[m]> Are you available for a quick question about something I have face in the SR?
2018-11-21T13:18:52  <georgit> stegru: You won't be using the Tray API provided by Electron but something which resembles it, correct?
2018-11-21T13:19:14  <stegru> I'll be (ab)using the API that electron uses
2018-11-21T13:20:02  <stegru> behind the scenes, explorer just sends windows messages to electron when the user interacts with the icon
2018-11-21T13:22:05  <georgit> stegru: What about hover messages and context menus?
2018-11-21T13:22:42  <georgit> And will we abandon the current tray icon?
2018-11-21T13:27:05  <stegru> no, I don't think the current tray will be abandoned, but there may be a site configuration option for it
2018-11-21T13:27:52  <stegru> the context menu should still work, but I don't know about the hover message
2018-11-21T13:28:04  <stegru> (i'm making it up as i go along)
2018-11-21T13:29:06  <georgit> stegru: Okay, so you will basically provide an API for a TrayButton which we can use instead of (or in addition to) the current Tray object that we use?
2018-11-21T13:31:00  <stegru> I think just adding an option to gpii.app.tray of "icon", "button", or "both" is enough

2018-11-21T13:53:49  <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, I'll take another look at it
2018-11-21T13:54:06  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m], what are you thinking?
2018-11-21T13:54:33  <Bosmon> stegru - ok, I didn't realise that the "Baseline" would continue to have a tray icon
2018-11-21T13:54:43  <Bosmon> I thought the idea was that it wouldn't?
2018-11-21T13:55:28  <stegru> I don't know if it will or not (I didn't think so either)
2018-11-21T13:56:19  <stegru> I wasn't discussing the baseline thing, with georgit
2018-11-21T13:56:48  <Bosmon> Oh I see
2018-11-21T13:56:56  <Bosmon> What is "your app" then?
2018-11-21T13:57:23  <stegru> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3540
2018-11-21T13:57:34  <stegru> it's a tray button, rather than an icon
2018-11-21T13:58:35  <Bosmon> Wow
2018-11-21T13:58:47  <Bosmon> This is to evade the issue with the icon being hidden?
2018-11-21T14:00:46  <stegru> yeh, and the white icon being invisible on the white H/C theme
2018-11-21T14:01:04  <Bosmon> Is a "tray button" some kind of standard Windows control or did you invent it?
2018-11-21T14:01:15  <stegru> invented
2018-11-21T14:01:23  <Bosmon> Incredible
2018-11-21T14:01:30  <Bosmon> How did you encourage the OS to allocate space for it?
2018-11-21T14:01:31  <stegru> well, it's just a window inside another window.. 80's technology
2018-11-21T14:01:37  <stegru> i just told it to
2018-11-21T14:01:40  <Bosmon> ....
2018-11-21T14:02:06  <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/tray-button/blob/master/tray-button.c#L79
2018-11-21T14:02:10  <Bosmon> Yes
2018-11-21T14:02:18  <Bosmon> I knew you were going to tell me to just look at the damn source
2018-11-21T14:02:22  <Bosmon> So I was there already : P
2018-11-21T14:02:22  <stegru> haha
2018-11-21T14:02:43  <stegru> rtfc
2018-11-21T14:02:47  <Bosmon> But I mean, this is nuts, isn't it?
2018-11-21T14:02:50  <javjarfer[m]> > Is a "tray button" some kind of standard Windows control or did you invent it?
2018-11-21T14:02:51  <javjarfer[m]> isn't really a standard Windows tray button?? Or it's because it's only exposed through the .Net APIs?
2018-11-21T14:02:52  <Bosmon> Doesn't the thing have some kind of layout algorithm
2018-11-21T14:03:03  <Bosmon> Why is it going to stay where you size it?
2018-11-21T14:03:06  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "I knew you were going to tell me"> hahahaha
2018-11-21T14:03:23  <stegru> yes, it stays that size, until the whole bar resizes
2018-11-21T14:04:13  <stegru> the taskbar looks like this: [window list][our button][icons+clock]
2018-11-21T14:05:21  <javjarfer[m]> Answering your previous question Bosmon I was trying to do this: https://pastebin.com/UXmBm8f1
2018-11-21T14:05:40  <stegru> it's a standard windows window, javjarfer[m]
2018-11-21T14:06:03  <javjarfer[m]> Problem is that "true" condition always expand to 0
2018-11-21T14:06:04  <simonjb> stegru: what if taskbar is vertical?
2018-11-21T14:06:26  <stegru> today it breaks, simonjb
2018-11-21T14:07:02  <stegru> but it's just an algorithm change
2018-11-21T14:07:22  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_ste "it's a standard windows window, "> really awkward that there is not derived controlled from the standard Windows construction that fits better there
2018-11-21T14:09:19  <javjarfer[m]> Could that be a issue regarding the conditional transform Bosmon ? Or am I doing something wrong there?
2018-11-21T14:10:28  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - it looks plausible
2018-11-21T14:12:09  <Bosmon> Can't see any obvious reason why it shouldn't work
2018-11-21T14:16:17  <javjarfer[m]> Okay, then I feel more confident than the code there is okay
2018-11-21T14:16:45  <javjarfer[m]> If I set a "outputPath": "value" to the final transform "true"
2018-11-21T14:17:06  <javjarfer[m]> I get "http://registry\.gpii\.net/applications/com\.microsoft\.windows\.mouseSettings.ScrollLines" as the output value
2018-11-21T14:17:31  <javjarfer[m]> Don't know if that gives you additional information about what could be happening
