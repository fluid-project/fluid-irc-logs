2018-09-25T11:51:47  <Bosmon4> I don't know if you had seen that there were new builds of universal and gpii-windows published over the weekend
2018-09-25T11:52:42  <Bosmon4> In theory they should resolve our integration issues with gpii-app but when jhernandez tried to merge them all straightforwardly
2018-09-25T11:52:42  <Bosmon4> there were still some test failures
2018-09-25T11:52:42  <Bosmon4> Perhaps you could take a look and try to produce an integrated build?

2018-09-25T13:26:34  <jhernandez> stegru: do you think that we should also consider removing the HST tools (that folder in the desktop with inventory scripts) if we also have the time for it?
2018-09-25T13:27:51  <stegru> yes jhernandez - are they required for the pilots? does anyone use them? I don't think so.
2018-09-25T13:27:55  <jhernandez> (or relocate them out of the desktop, in Program Files/GPII folder or the like)
2018-09-25T13:28:07  <stegru> yes moving them would be best
