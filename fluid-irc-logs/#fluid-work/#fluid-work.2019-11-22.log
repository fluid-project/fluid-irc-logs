2019-11-22T12:25:33  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - your and klown's pulls are now merged and I have issued 0.3.0-dev.20191122T122441Z.d141625ca of universal in advance of the BIG PUSH on Monday
2019-11-22T12:27:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  did my PR fix up all the issues in your PR?
2019-11-22T12:27:10  <Bosmon> Justin_o - just checking now
2019-11-22T12:27:42  *** jhernandez <jhernandez!~jhernande@2a02:a03f:3e72:c800:afce:ea01:d362:3594> has joined #fluid-work
2019-11-22T12:28:09  <Bosmon> Actually I had found exactly the same issue in my previous adjustment to the enactor tests here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/970/commits/e45140a6dd6d064ed24b2cf1670d2b2a519b7d3a#diff-0322b3f60fc2ecfad187809947f88218R370
2019-11-22T12:28:20  <Bosmon> I just failed to spot that in your case it was the faulty name that had been resolved FIRST : P
2019-11-22T12:33:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess this is a new change to the framework. Is there a way to guard against this, or to have the member name be the first resolvable value.
2019-11-22T12:34:11  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm just filing an issue : P
2019-11-22T12:34:17  <Justin_o> and what happens if there is another grade name on the component that is used as the type, that happens to match the member name.. that is, it wouldn't be visible in the defaults block. would that affect the name resolution?
2019-11-22T12:34:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2019-11-22T12:34:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you happen to also see the issue with testem that I was getting with your branch?
2019-11-22T12:35:03  <Bosmon> We've always had this ambiguity, but there wasn't a possibility for inconsistent behaviour until we created the "fast path" for scope resolution for "fast invokers" etc.
2019-11-22T12:35:28  <Bosmon> In order to fix the FLUID-6426 aliasing issues I finished moving over the last remaining sites from their faulty use of "fluid.expandOptions" to "fluid.expandImmediate"
2019-11-22T12:35:48  <Bosmon> Which created new sites where it is possible to observe the "other" scope resolution rules
2019-11-22T13:09:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6433
2019-11-22T13:09:40  <Bosmon> Just pushing your pulls through my various branches now ....
2019-11-22T13:11:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. and the JIRA looks good too. I wonder if we should create a dev tool plugin/extension at some point
2019-11-22T13:11:31  <Justin_o> maybe that would help as an intermediate step between what we have now and a full authoring tool
2019-11-22T13:12:23  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, once we start to have some "new rendering" stuff in master this tool could be helpful
2019-11-22T13:13:15  <Bosmon> For example we could stuff a more souped-up version of this interface into the extension: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidViewDebugging.js
2019-11-22T13:13:46  <Bosmon> You may remember I gave a little demo of this interface in 2015 : P
2019-11-22T13:15:47  <Justin_o> Right I think you were in Toronto at the time, if I'm not mistaken.
2019-11-22T13:21:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yesterday we had been talking a bit about how to pass down the configuration for things like the TableOfContents templates and message bundles. It would also cover any other configuration that someone using the tool wants to supply outside of values in the schema.
2019-11-22T13:22:32  <Justin_o> I was remember how things used to work for the builder, and is actually still present, which is that you can supply an auxiliary schema directly to the options when you are instantiating the component. Before this was passed through fluid.prefs.create, but now I'm making the builder be that create grade. Anyways, what are you thoughts on this configuration at instantiation?
2019-11-22T13:22:40  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/guGsAsOz/
2019-11-22T13:23:23  <Bosmon> Justin_o - perhaps a relatively clean and not too intrusive scheme might introduce top-level component options areas named after the names of nested grades, e.g. ....
2019-11-22T13:23:27  <Bosmon> Yes, quite similar to what I was thinking
2019-11-22T13:23:29  <Justin_o> I had written distribute options for the items at the top level of the auxiliarySchema (e.g. terms, defeaultLocale) so those could be passed as top level options, but maybe those should be left in the auxiliarySchema as is depicted here
2019-11-22T13:23:41  <Bosmon> Perhaps we could name the options area after the full grade name, since they have just used it anyway in the configuration at the bottom
2019-11-22T13:23:49  <Bosmon> "fluid.prefs.tableOfContents"
2019-11-22T13:24:05  <Bosmon> It would help to tie things together in their mind, and also keep the top-level options a bit less crowded-looking
2019-11-22T13:24:32  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I believe I've been thinking the same thing.. instead of keying it tableOfContents, we'd key it fluid.prefs.tableOfContents, which is the pref that they have to specify anyways, so we can expect them to know what it is
2019-11-22T13:24:50  <Justin_o> currently they would have to find the related auxiliarySchema to know the path to the options to set
2019-11-22T13:25:23  <Bosmon> awesome
2019-11-22T13:25:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so are you suggesting that I remove the "auxiliarySchema" wrapper from the options?
2019-11-22T13:26:08  <Justin_o> or when you say top-level did you mean inside of the auxiliaryShema options?
2019-11-22T13:27:16  <Bosmon> Justin_o - top level in there, yes
2019-11-22T13:27:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool.. so I think that this change would also mean we can drop the "type" field from those blocks in the auxiliarySchemas, because the key is the type
2019-11-22T13:28:27  <Bosmon> Although I think it would be better if the auxSchema stuff were itself more clearly attached to a grade of some kind
2019-11-22T13:28:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: what do you mean?
2019-11-22T13:29:50  <Bosmon> Well I guess it's ok the way it is for now, but eventually people will want to compose these things somehow.... the-t-in-rtf will deal with similar kinds of issues in his "live solutions registry"
2019-11-22T13:30:36  <Bosmon> "typeFilter" is named pretty strangely
2019-11-22T13:31:15  <Bosmon> I don't think any user will grasp what that does from its name : P
2019-11-22T13:31:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here are the split out schema holding grades. https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6420/src/framework/preferences/js/StarterSchemas.js
2019-11-22T13:32:01  <Bosmon> Justin_o - right, I forgot we have these already : P
2019-11-22T13:32:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, the typeFilter is legacy from the primaryBuilder, I'm going to rename that to preferences or something like that when I've gotten all the parts working and start the clean up
2019-11-22T13:33:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so one wrinkle is that I'm now using a similar approach that the primary builder does to source the auxiliary schemas using fluid.indexDefaults
2019-11-22T13:33:29  <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6420/src/framework/preferences/js/PrimaryBuilder.js
2019-11-22T13:33:46  <Justin_o> I'll need to do some clean up here to reduce duplication, but haven't done that yet either.
2019-11-22T13:34:24  <Justin_o> anyways, the issue would be that if you create another grade with a previous schema as a base grade, I think fluid.indexDefaults would find both
2019-11-22T13:34:34  <Justin_o> I'm not sure we want that, but also it may not make a differnce
2019-11-22T13:35:26  <Justin_o> because we just add all of these as gradeNames onto the top level component to merge all of the options.
2019-11-22T13:35:41  <Justin_o> also if there is a better way to do all of this now, I'm open to just switching everything
2019-11-22T13:35:47  <Justin_o> related to this part anyways

2019-11-22T16:25:03  <jhernandez> cindyli: hey
2019-11-22T16:25:07  <jhernandez> are you around?
2019-11-22T16:25:20  <cindyli> yes, jhernandez
2019-11-22T16:25:27  <jhernandez> have a question about the allowedPrefsToWrite block
2019-11-22T16:26:15  <jhernandez> so, as we are including new controls to deal with recently onboarded stuff
2019-11-22T16:26:58  <jhernandez> I guess that we need to update our allowedPrefsToWrite block in our client credentials to allow users to save those new settings
2019-11-22T16:28:07  <cindyli> yes, jhernandez
2019-11-22T16:28:27  <jhernandez> Gregg asked me if there was a way to not having to update such field each time we add new settings
2019-11-22T16:28:41  <jhernandez> :)
2019-11-22T16:29:10  <cindyli> this is a security check. removing it means removing a layer of guard, jhernandez
2019-11-22T16:29:18  <jhernandez> and skip the step of updating the credentials that are already in the cloud
2019-11-22T16:29:23  <jhernandez> exactly
2019-11-22T16:29:28  <jhernandez> I know what that means
2019-11-22T16:29:39  <jhernandez> that's exactly what I told him
2019-11-22T16:31:21  <cindyli> jhernandez: it's easy to remove it from the code, but i hope his decision is not to…
2019-11-22T16:31:45  <cindyli> it's not hard to add a new setting to the cloud, there's only a couple of credentials need to be updated
2019-11-22T16:31:58  <jhernandez> yes
2019-11-22T16:32:08  <cindyli> and once we have UI for editing these records, it would be even easier
2019-11-22T16:32:26  <jhernandez> for now we should be ok with that
2019-11-22T16:33:03  <jhernandez> so, in order to update the credentials
2019-11-22T16:33:50  <jhernandez> do you recommend creating a script that updates them?
2019-11-22T16:33:51  <cindyli> start couchdb_ui -> open fauxton in a browser -> update credential records
2019-11-22T16:33:55  <jhernandez> well, yes
2019-11-22T16:34:00  <jhernandez> that's the other option
2019-11-22T16:34:07  <cindyli> we can write a script too
2019-11-22T16:34:13  <jhernandez> but, will devops be happy with thay approach?
2019-11-22T16:34:19  <jhernandez> s/thay/that
2019-11-22T16:34:22  <jhernandez> :P
2019-11-22T16:34:26  <cindyli> maybe not ;)
2019-11-22T16:34:29  <jhernandez> ok
2019-11-22T16:34:44  <jhernandez> I'll ask in #devops on slack
