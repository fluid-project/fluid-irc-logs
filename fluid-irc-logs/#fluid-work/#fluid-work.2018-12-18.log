2018-12-18T13:40:19  <dandimitrov> Hey stegru, Bosmon: Currently the language setting displayed in the PSP uses language codes with capitalized regions whereas the QS language setting uses lowercase. I suppose we should synchronize the format of the language setting values. Probably use the capitalized version in both?
2018-12-18T13:41:56  <stegru> i have no preference
2018-12-18T13:42:34  <stegru> do you mean the language code? es-MX?
2018-12-18T13:43:01  <stegru> yes you do
2018-12-18T13:43:17  <Bosmon> If you do, it looks like these should be capitalised
2018-12-18T13:43:28  <Bosmon> Here are some language settings which the-t-in-rtf onboarded for JAWS: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3154
2018-12-18T13:52:43  <dandimitrov> stegru: yep, that’s type of code
2018-12-18T13:53:08  <dandimitrov> should this go to the gpii.windows.language?
2018-12-18T13:53:14  <stegru> yes sorry, I didn't fully read your message

2018-12-18T13:56:45  <stegru> dandimitrov, windows.language already returns the capitalised version (en-US)
2018-12-18T13:59:36  <dandimitrov> well, yes, but its kind of a mix
2018-12-18T13:59:49  <dandimitrov> just let me make you a snippet
2018-12-18T14:00:31  <dandimitrov> Here you are: https://pastebin.com/RE1X1bp8  I have a few languages installed
2018-12-18T14:01:35  <stegru> dandimitrov, ah ok - yes, I can change that in windows.langauges
2018-12-18T14:03:44  <dandimitrov> great, thanks

2018-12-18T14:07:52  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Just one more thing about the language setting - I’m not sure what the expected behaviour for the PSP language setting is with the “Installed languages” functionality. At the moment only the QSS uses the installed languages list whereas the PSP language setting uses a predefined list. Probably they should both use the installed languages list?
2018-12-18T14:08:51  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - I imagine they should use the installed language list yes, although it is naturally something that should be confirmed by UX
2018-12-18T14:18:02  <dandimitrov> Ok, I can add a comment to the GPII-3544 with this question

2018-12-18T14:42:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have a contextAwareness check setup that looks at the value of one of the components options (localizationScheme). That seemed to be working. However, I'm not try to set that value using distributeOptions and it doesn't seem to be picked up. If i look in the component though the option has been set.

2018-12-18T14:50:21  <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - what do you mean by the discrepancy between "doesn't seem to be picked up" and "the option has been set"
2018-12-18T14:56:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the contextAwareness isn't kicking in

2018-12-18T14:56:32  <Justin_o> but if i look into the component options, the value that the contextAwareness is supposed to be looking for is there
2018-12-18T14:56:54  <Justin_o> I wonder if it is being set too late?
2018-12-18T14:57:16  <Justin_o> let me know if you'd like to screen share or anything to see it running

2018-12-18T15:00:47  <Bosmon> Could you put what you have written in a pastie or check it in or so?
2018-12-18T15:00:55  <Bosmon> In general these checks, at the client end, can only look at grades
2018-12-18T15:01:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: similar to this example https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ContextAwareness.html#example-contextawareness-record
