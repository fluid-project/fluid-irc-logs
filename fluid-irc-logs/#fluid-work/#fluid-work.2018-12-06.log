2018-12-06T08:49:03  <dandimitrov> I tested the latest state of the GPII-3544 branch but something isn’t quite right. The `configuredLanguage` model property doesn’t get updated when the system’s language changes :/

2018-12-06T10:31:42  <stegru> georgit: I've just updated the branch
2018-12-06T10:59:43  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon and @javjarfer[m], there is a new dev release of gpii-pouchdb that should address the directory renaming and cleanup failure issues: 1.0.13-dev.20181206T105853Z.8e5279c
2018-12-06T10:59:55  <the-t-in-rtf> this time I'll actually submit it for review... :|
2018-12-06T11:01:31  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/pull/22
2018-12-06T11:02:03  <georgit> stegru: Thanks, it is working now. However, I am still seeing the slowness. Did you try your work in the GPII app? Try to open a QSS menu and see if the QSS button becomes white instantly or if there is a delay
2018-12-06T11:02:33  <georgit> On my VM there is still a delay when applying the white background
2018-12-06T11:03:10  <georgit> On the other hand, I am not sure how significant this issue is as the UX is not affected that much.
2018-12-06T11:08:07  <georgit> Bosmon, stegru, anyone else: I see that the item with the highest priority for Morphic 1.1 is the Morphic Switch. There are various ideas mentioned in the first draft document - about the mechanism for implementing the switch as well as for whether the GPII app and the metrics application should be one or separate app.
2018-12-06T11:08:56  <georgit> Have you reached an agreement on these items so that we can start the implementation on our end?
2018-12-06T11:18:05  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S01069050ca694f23.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2018-12-06T11:20:53  <jhernandez> georgit: how slow is it? stegru's fix didn't make any difference for you?
2018-12-06T11:24:00  <georgit> jhernandez: The behavior is the same as before. Maybe 300 ms slower than it has to be
2018-12-06T11:28:15  <javjarfer[m]> hi there the-t-in-rtf do you think that could be related with the issue we were seeing yesterday?
2018-12-06T11:54:36  <jhernandez> georgit: heh, funny behavior here
2018-12-06T11:56:09  <jhernandez> when you start the app, there is no slowness in the first 5/6 interactions
2018-12-06T11:56:28  <jhernandez> then, you can start noticing it as you open/close more popups
2018-12-06T11:56:46  <jhernandez> hmmm
2018-12-06T12:00:07  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], I seriously doubt it, the problem I was addressing only occurs when attempting to reset express-pouchdb
2018-12-06T12:00:14  <the-t-in-rtf> and even that fails instantly
2018-12-06T12:00:24  <the-t-in-rtf> or would fail instantly until the fix I just made... ;)
2018-12-06T12:02:38  <javjarfer[m]> oh great the-t-in-rtf , anyway, thanks for letting us know
2018-12-06T12:08:34  <jhernandez> stegru: question
2018-12-06T12:09:06  <jhernandez> do I expect the metrics to be doing anything if filebeat is not installed?

2018-12-06T12:52:15  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: can you remind me why we switched from docpad-plugin-marked to docpad-plugin-markit? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/commit/e715c76b89120ecaec2d7af9c6bc6ea30f878831
2018-12-06T12:52:33  <the-t-in-rtf> marked was a horrible security vulnerability
2018-12-06T12:52:42  <the-t-in-rtf> that never ever ever was patched in a timely fashion
2018-12-06T12:53:08  <the-t-in-rtf> it maters less for the docpad stuff per se, but for handlebars (where I support renderering markdown, it was a real issue)
2018-12-06T12:53:16  <the-t-in-rtf> s/maters/matters/
2018-12-06T12:53:52  <the-t-in-rtf> like the last two snyk vulnerabilities against marked had open PRs to fix them that were never reviewed for months or even years on end
2018-12-06T12:54:02  <the-t-in-rtf> which is not a good sign about its health in general
2018-12-06T12:54:14  <the-t-in-rtf> why do you ask, is there something you haven't been able to do with markdown-it?
2018-12-06T12:55:01  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: that makes sense.. So i'm finding that I can no longer run the Infusion-Docs docpad on my machine, probably because I'm running Node 10 and the latest DocPad.. I've updated the dependencies but it seems that markit hasn't been updated in 2 years.
2018-12-06T12:55:22  <Justin_o> DocPad switched to using CoffeeScript v2 so any plugin that is still using v1 seems to break
2018-12-06T12:55:43  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon
2018-12-06T12:56:00  <the-t-in-rtf> we are giving up and rescheduling so that Steve can get on with his morning
2018-12-06T12:56:08  <sgithens> hahahahaha
2018-12-06T12:56:18  <sgithens> It was still a useful chat :)
2018-12-06T12:56:22  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: seems that change happened at v6.80.0-beta 2018 March 7
2018-12-06T12:56:31  <Justin_o> they are now at v6.82.5
2018-12-06T12:58:09  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: You can see that the markit plugin is now quite stale https://github.com/tbusser/docpad-plugin-markit
2018-12-06T12:59:44  <Justin_o> marked has at least upgraded to CoffeeScript v2 but it doesn't look like they've changed anything else since the time we switched to markit https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-marked/commits/master
2018-12-06T13:05:38  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: perhaps my search is poor but this is not looking promising https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=docpad%20markdown
2018-12-06T13:09:42  <Bosmon> Oh the-t-in-rtf, sgithens - sorry
2018-12-06T13:10:00  <the-t-in-rtf> it's fine, Cindy wasn't there either, I sent an invite for Tuesday

2018-12-06T13:10:49  <Bosmon> Didn't expect it to run until now ...
2018-12-06T13:13:16  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @Justin_o, here's what I'm talking about.
2018-12-06T13:13:18  <the-t-in-rtf> https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:marked
2018-12-06T13:13:48  <the-t-in-rtf> six high priority vulnerabilities, three medium, and some of them are ancient
2018-12-06T13:14:18  <the-t-in-rtf> https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:markdown-it
2018-12-06T13:14:29  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, I see, weird
2018-12-06T13:14:36  <the-t-in-rtf> snyk now shows you "all time" in one view
2018-12-06T13:14:53  <Bosmon> stegru - do you want to do the "Morphic Switch"? I think it just needs you to write an appropriate "config" that includes just your metrics

2018-12-06T13:16:31  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, tracking it back, looks like marked has improved its fortunes since the switch
2018-12-06T13:16:43  <the-t-in-rtf> they have a new site and it seems like a more active team since January
2018-12-06T13:17:15  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/v0.3.12
2018-12-06T13:17:25  <the-t-in-rtf> Their release cadence is much much better now
2018-12-06T13:18:21  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, I meant to link to this one: https://github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/0.3.14
2018-12-06T13:20:23  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  okay, that looks good..
2018-12-06T13:20:57  <Justin_o> the docpad-plugin-marked was updated to point at marked v0.4.0 https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-marked/blob/master/package.json#L97
2018-12-06T13:21:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, they haven't had any vulnerabilities yet in the 4.0 line
2018-12-06T13:21:23  <the-t-in-rtf> 0.4.0
2018-12-06T13:21:43  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: great.. so i should be safe to switch back to the marked plugin then
2018-12-06T13:21:59  <Justin_o> not that these docpad plugins are very active though ;(
2018-12-06T13:22:06  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, that was my next point
2018-12-06T13:22:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, maybe dust off the last technical review of publishing platforms and revisit that briefly
2018-12-06T13:22:33  <the-t-in-rtf> just to see if there's a healthier community working in the same space
2018-12-06T13:22:50  <the-t-in-rtf> especially if you can find one with key improvements that would justify the time in updating
2018-12-06T13:22:55  <the-t-in-rtf> for example, integrated search
2018-12-06T13:24:23  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: avtar and simonjb have been looking into another one for the sites they have been building. I'm not sure we have time or are ready to the make the switch yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if we do at some point. Also Avtar was showing me a service yesterday that provides free searching for open source.. i can't remember the name at the moment though
2018-12-06T13:24:50  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  sorry off topic but i've finally remember to ask you if you've heard of this https://www.hackyourfuture.net
2018-12-06T13:25:09  <Justin_o> of course now i can't remember who mentioned it to me either, so hopefully it wasn't you ;)
2018-12-06T13:25:48  <the-t-in-rtf> no, it wasn't me, and that's very interesting
2018-12-06T13:26:00  <the-t-in-rtf> so, thanks.
2018-12-06T13:26:17  <Justin_o> :)
2018-12-06T13:30:17  <stegru> Bosmon, yes I'll do the switch
2018-12-06T13:30:52  <Bosmon> stegru - I guess the only oddity is the electron process business - I assume it will make the least upheaval if the top-level process is still an electron one
2018-12-06T13:30:57  <stegru> jhernandez, yes the metrics will still be working if filebeat isn't running
2018-12-06T13:32:02  <stegru> I intend on just having a config to just shut things off from the outside, Bosmon
2018-12-06T13:32:23  <Bosmon> What do you mean, "shut things off from the outside"?
2018-12-06T13:32:27  <stegru> ie, no icon and not listening

2018-12-06T13:34:40  <stegru> I've made a seperate source tree for just the metrics, but it's an arse to keep it inline with the real gpii
2018-12-06T13:36:47  <Bosmon> stegru - right, just packaging the existing metrics stuff in a mostly empty tree will be much smoother
2018-12-06T13:36:53  <Bosmon> But I was wondering what you meant by "from the outside"
2018-12-06T13:37:35  <stegru> ah, i meant.. disable things that are visible from the outside
2018-12-06T13:37:47  <stegru> things that make morphic appear to exist

2018-12-06T13:44:20  <stegru> but there's no "switch flipping" ability, and there's a maintenance cost of keeping it inline with master

2018-12-06T15:08:24  <jhernandez> georgit: I see an improvement when scrlk is on
2018-12-06T15:08:39  <jhernandez> but still the slowness is noticeable
2018-12-06T15:11:13  <stegru> I only notice it when clicking a different button than the last one
2018-12-06T15:11:37  <georgit> jhernandez: maybe I need to allocate less resources to my VM
2018-12-06T15:12:55  <jhernandez> georgit: yup
2018-12-06T15:15:47  <stegru> after a while, one of the processes is always using ~40% cpu (out of 2 cores)
2018-12-06T15:17:51  <jhernandez> stegru: is it the main process?
2018-12-06T15:18:08  <jhernandez> or one of the n morphic-app processes
2018-12-06T15:18:09  <jhernandez> ?
2018-12-06T15:18:11  <stegru> it's the one with the most memory
2018-12-06T15:18:17  <jhernandez> :)
2018-12-06T15:26:25  <jhernandez> yeah, it's the main process
2018-12-06T15:26:29  <Justin_o> jhung, alanharn_: so looks like they removed the server functionality from docpad. I didn't really need it anyways, but it was useful for testing. https://github.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1081
2018-12-06T15:29:16  <alanharn_> Justin_o: and per the comments on the project's potential defunctness: https://github.com/docpad/docpad/issues/1072

2018-12-06T15:51:40  <the-t-in-rtf> Can someone who hasn't updated to the latest Windows 10 Vagrant VM confirm the size of the old x64 "Apps" box?
2018-12-06T15:52:00  <the-t-in-rtf> the latest version is 18 Gb, which seems much bigger than it should be
2018-12-06T15:53:22  <dandimitrov>  the-t-in-rtf: The old once seems to be 10 Gb
2018-12-06T15:53:39  <the-t-in-rtf> thank you
2018-12-06T15:53:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I will reply to Alfredo's note to the group then.
2018-12-06T15:54:01  <the-t-in-rtf> with the base image itself I can only keep one VM alive at a time now

2018-12-06T16:20:35  <Bosmon> alanharnum, Justin_o - could hugo be a reasonable replacement for docpad? Does it have some kind of feature parity?
2018-12-06T16:21:16  <Bosmon> stegru - if you break into the high CPU process with the debuggger, what does it seem to be doing?
2018-12-06T16:21:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: avtar and simonjb have been working with it and could probably answer that better. we do have some custom helpers and do some other pre-processing with the docpad.
2018-12-06T16:22:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i'm in the process of just trying to be able to build the infusion-docs with the latest docpad and node at the moment
2018-12-06T16:22:33  <stegru> nothing, Bosmon - the break just waits, then it stops at a timeout callback.
2018-12-06T16:23:30  <Bosmon> stegru - really wierd - so the CPU usage might be hidden in some native process?
2018-12-06T16:23:54  <alanharnum> Bosmon: Hugo has feature parity in every area I'm aware of except CSS preprocessing
2018-12-06T16:24:11  <Bosmon> alanharnum - awesome, it would be really great if we could all move to the same platform
2018-12-06T16:24:19  <stegru> yes, perhaps. I'm now using a native debugger - just trying to get the debug symbols for electron
2018-12-06T16:24:44  <avtar> alanharnum: they have this new pipes feature https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/
2018-12-06T16:25:29  <avtar> i'm using it here https://github.com/avtar/sojustrepairit.org/blob/SJRK-166/layouts/_default/baseof.html#L8
2018-12-06T16:25:32  <alanharnum> avtar: yes, just saw that looking around at least updates
2018-12-06T16:25:57  <alanharnum> Bosmon: I must retract that statement, as it looks like they recently added SASS/SCSS processing: https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/
2018-12-06T16:26:14  <Bosmon> amazing
2018-12-06T16:26:47  <alanharnum> I can say from my own experience of converting a static site from Jekyll to Hugo that it was reasonably straightforward
2018-12-06T16:27:11  <alanharnum> didn't have to do too much processing of the document-based content, just the layouts

2018-12-06T17:21:22  <stegru> Bosmon jhernandez, cpu usage was due to the animated svg in the wait page - when I disabled it in css (or removed the animation tag from the svg), cpu usage dropped
2018-12-06T17:23:52  <stegru> normal chrome doesn't require a whole core to render it

2018-12-06T21:27:13  <Bosmon> bryan_  is getting the standard old chestnut "Unable to locate the bindigs file" for ffi-napi" when trying to run the gpii-app tests
2018-12-06T21:27:21  <Bosmon> He has switched to a Windows host for a Windows VM, I think?
2018-12-06T21:27:34  <Bosmon> My best guess is that the node_modules tree has become polluted with binaries built from outside the VM
2018-12-06T21:27:42  <Bosmon> And recommending removing the node_modules tree and trying again

2018-12-06T21:31:53  <Bosmon> Do you have some Windows-only dev tools?
2018-12-06T21:32:06  <bryan_> Photoshop lol
2018-12-06T21:32:41  <bryan_> Every night I was rebooting to work on personal projects
2018-12-06T21:32:44  <Bosmon> ha!
2018-12-06T21:32:50  <Bosmon> Yeah, I understand
2018-12-06T21:32:57  <bryan_> Gimp isnt quite the same
2018-12-06T21:33:05  <Bosmon> People do make fun of me for running Windows 7 as my main desktop OS
2018-12-06T21:33:14  <Bosmon> But there's just too much stuff I don't want to lose hold of
2018-12-06T21:34:16  <bryan_> Wow 7...that's a classic
2018-12-06T21:34:46  <Bosmon> Amazingly it's still just about viable - with a lot of shoe-horning and bashing, I managed to get drivers working for it on all-new hardware
2018-12-06T21:35:22  <Bosmon> When the-t-in-rtf makes his new Docker containers to hold CouchDB though, it will make life a little tougher for me
2018-12-06T21:35:35  <Bosmon> Since one of the main things that doesn't work natively on Windows 7 is Docker for Windows
2018-12-06T21:36:05  <bryan_> Ah...time to let go of the past
2018-12-06T21:36:42  <Bosmon> Never!
2018-12-06T21:38:25  <sgithens> hahahahahahahaha
2018-12-06T21:38:47  <bryan_> I'm deleting node_modules...28,793 files in there
2018-12-06T21:38:55  <sgithens> Maybe you should run Widnows 10 in a VM to get the docker support

2018-12-06T21:58:17  <Bosmon> bryan_ - the deletion can run a lot faster from the outer VM I guess, the FS has a lot lower latency
2018-12-06T21:59:48  <bryan_> It didnt take long...I was just amazed at the number of files. I did npm install and then the VM started installing windows updates and shut down. Waiting for it to start up again

2018-12-06T23:43:10  <Bosmon> Actually Alfredo has released a more recent box in the last few days so you could do an update at some point
2018-12-06T23:43:19  <Bosmon> Leave it for a quiet moment since it will take forever :)
2018-12-06T23:43:30  <Bosmon> I believe the route is i) vagrant destroy, ii) vagrant box update, iii) vagrant up
2018-12-06T23:52:02  <bryan_> Ok I'm at the dentist now but I'll try the updated box later. Before I left I was getting a different error about not finding  python in the path
