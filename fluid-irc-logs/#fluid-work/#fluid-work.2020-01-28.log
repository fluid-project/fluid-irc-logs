2020-01-28T13:40:03  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: amazing! Such quick work :) much appreciated. Indeed I wasn't able to get my page to load yesterday, and I could only get my browser tests to work if I set the querystring relays to false. We've got a few hours of meetings this morning, I'll give it a shot after that and give feedback there
2020-01-28T13:41:18  <the-t-in-rtf> cool, glad my fix didn't make you sick this time.

2020-01-28T15:56:47  <Bosmon> Hi there gmoss, michelled - the state of the SJRK branch is looking pretty good so I merged it in, congrats on your excellent and careful long-term work on this!
2020-01-28T15:56:59  <Bosmon> I think I ran into the "Kettle crash" which you mentioned last week and I have filed it as https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-322

2020-01-28T16:00:02  <Bosmon> Now we are back into a regular workflow you may want to enlist the project into some kind of CI
2020-01-28T16:00:14  <Bosmon> I hear from Justin_o that "Github Actions" is popular these days : P

2020-01-28T16:11:44  <colinclark> hey, thatâ€™s cool Bosmon, thanks for looking at it and merging
2020-01-28T16:12:19  <colinclark> and yes, Github Actions is a nice place to look for CI support these days. I know that C2LC and the platform co-op projects use it and like it
2020-01-28T16:23:49  <gmoss> Bosmon: awesome, thanks! I have to take a look at SJRK-322 after our meetings, but there is already a Jira for that issue that simonjb filed, SJRK-187 iirc. I can reconcile them if you haven't the time :)
2020-01-28T16:25:08  <Bosmon> gmoss oh wow, 187, it is as old as this ....
2020-01-28T16:26:01  <Bosmon> Quite surprising that the framework upgrade has not affected it in the least
2020-01-28T16:26:56  <gmoss> Bosmon: yeah we noticed it when we really started testing heavily this time last year. In fact the framework upgrade has made the issue more common! I think as our code is getting faster, it's increasing the chances of this cropping up
2020-01-28T16:27:33  <Bosmon> Well, super-helpful to be able to see the full stack again

2020-01-28T16:30:53  <Bosmon> hmm, no, I don't
2020-01-28T16:31:08  <Bosmon> Its assumption that fluid.fail will throw an exception is valid
2020-01-28T16:31:32  <gmoss> Bosmon: my attempts at discovering the source involved finding another project running Kettle in the same way I use it, but I could only find Bubbles and had trouble getting that to run
2020-01-28T16:31:35  <gmoss> but I digress...
2020-01-28T16:33:03  <gmoss> Bosmon: I plan to close 322 as a  duplicate, would you mind pasting your description as a comment on SJRK-187 at some point?
2020-01-28T16:33:21  <Bosmon> gmoss sure, will do
2020-01-28T16:33:27  <gmoss> Thanks :)
2020-01-28T17:03:08  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I've merged the-t-in-rtf's https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/842/files - could you remerge your Colour Vision pull and see if it now passes validation? Cheers!

2020-01-28T19:13:39  <sgithens> cindyli: On this processRead invoker, it says to use the manually created 'read' invoker instead. Where does that come from on? I don't see it in the grades, and I don't believe it comes from it's inherited grades. Does it come from a mix-in or something? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L228
2020-01-28T19:14:13  <sgithens> I'm combining our code right now as you suggest in the PR
2020-01-28T19:14:44  <cindyli> thanks, sgithens. it comes from here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L118
2020-01-28T19:15:09  <sgithens> oh
2020-01-28T19:15:20  <sgithens> interesting
2020-01-28T19:15:48  <sgithens> so that expander syntax creates invokers from everything in the value property
2020-01-28T19:16:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: yes, I believe it's the same as the one documented in SJRK-187 and that I mentioned the other day before realizing 187 existed
2020-01-28T19:16:16  <cindyli> yes, sgithens. here's the function that creates new invokers - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L491
2020-01-28T19:19:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, I linked those two issues together. Hopefully all the info you have on the problem will help Bosmon track down the source
2020-01-28T19:20:07  <gmoss> Justin_o: should we not just close 322 as a duplicate and keep the work in 187? or is this in case they aren't the same? the stack trace in 187 (both simon's and my log) contain the call that Bosmon mentioned in his filing
2020-01-28T19:32:15  <Justin_o> gmoss: it should be safe to close then... and we can always re-open if needed anyways.
2020-01-28T19:32:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: good point :) I'll close it now
2020-01-28T19:32:35  <Justin_o> thanks
2020-01-28T19:34:16  <gmoss> Bosmon: tangentially related to this, you have merged your PR into the branch "re-review". Do you have any designs for this branch? also, how do you feel about merging the same code into the master branch? (there's a Jira for that last task)
2020-01-28T19:37:37  <Bosmon> gmoss - but it was merged into the master branch!
2020-01-28T19:37:42  <gmoss> Bosmon: :O
2020-01-28T19:37:53  <gmoss> so it was!
2020-01-28T19:37:55  <gmoss> well then
2020-01-28T19:38:03  <gmoss> today is a big day haha
2020-01-28T19:39:14  <gmoss> michelled cindyli ^^
2020-01-28T19:39:28  <michelled> :)
2020-01-28T19:39:44  <Bosmon> sgithens - this isn't a technique for general use, mind, don't get any ideas : P
2020-01-28T19:40:55  <sgithens> yeah... even after reading the comments, I only sort of understand why it was done... it seems a bit confusing
2020-01-28T19:42:18  <Bosmon> sgithens - well, there's just a pretty regular pattern in the structure of the LifecycleManager, that it has a bunch of invokers that each have the effect of queueing a unit of work which produces a promise from a method of a related name

2020-01-28T19:51:28  <Bosmon> gmoss - starting to get an idea about the Kettle crash....
2020-01-28T19:51:42  <Bosmon> The crucial thing is not what is on the stack, but what is not on it : P
2020-01-28T19:53:45  <Bosmon> Although I think in practice the best plan is to down grade this particular site from fluid.fail to a log since I think it doesn't represent a design failure of the application
2020-01-28T19:53:57  <Bosmon> Which is primarily what fluid.fail is meant to represent
2020-01-28T19:54:21  <Bosmon> gmoss - have you seen these failure in ordinary use of the application, rather than just in the test cases?
2020-01-28T19:54:46  <gmoss> Bosmon: I have
2020-01-28T19:54:53  <gmoss> In fact that was the first place I encountered it
2020-01-28T19:55:42  <gmoss> Bosmon: scratch that, I remember now, it was testing.
2020-01-28T19:56:02  <gmoss> I think I have though... i'm less sure now of my memory and will attempt to reproduce it presently :)

2020-01-28T19:59:42  <gmoss> Bosmon: confirmed, it happens in the Browse page as well
2020-01-28T20:00:25  <Bosmon> ok
2020-01-28T20:00:29  <Bosmon> I wish I could see it happening
2020-01-28T20:00:38  <Bosmon> But I guess I will just need to keep thinking
2020-01-28T20:00:55  <Bosmon> But I think it is true that this does not necessarily represent a design failure
2020-01-28T20:01:07  <Bosmon> There are all kinds of reasons a request may end before all of the I/O issued by its middleware completes
2020-01-28T20:01:16  <Bosmon> I'm just puzzled what the reason actually *is* that this request completes
2020-01-28T20:02:32  <Bosmon> I mean, that request is only headed for a further failure anyway - once it notices that its request has somehow issued a response, it will kick up a further fuss as the middleware tries to write one
2020-01-28T20:02:39  <Bosmon> But there's no way this should terminate the server
2020-01-28T20:08:47  <gmoss> Bosmon: it is very curious. I poked around with the tests to see it was a particular test suite that would trigger this (i.e. if it's a design flaw in the page grade), but i was able to make it happen with the test sequences for the templateManager and the transforms as well. I'm still not totally sure this *isn't* an issue with the Storytelling Tool

2020-01-28T20:09:59  <gmoss> Bosmon: how are you trying to reproduce the issue?
2020-01-28T20:10:47  <Bosmon> gmoss - I only ever saw it once, when running the test cases
2020-01-28T20:10:56  <Bosmon> I ran them another 10 times and it had vanished
2020-01-28T20:11:22  <gmoss> Bosmon: I had good luck reproducing it if i tried to load several identical tabs simultaneously :)
2020-01-28T20:11:24  <Bosmon> gmoss - it's extremely likely a Kettle issue, but it's hard to be completely sure without understanding why the request concludes
2020-01-28T20:12:01  <Bosmon> It should be impossible for there to be an alternative between having its response served by the static middleware and having it served by some other means
2020-01-28T20:12:40  <Bosmon> gmoss - ok, I'll give that a go : P
2020-01-28T20:13:33  <gmoss> Bosmon: I got very good at holding Ctrl and furiously alternating between Tab and F5 hah.. best of luck

2020-01-28T21:04:15  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: I found what looks to be a typo in gpii-location-bar-relay: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-location-bar-relay/blame/63a2db091824a5accd8636a34b4b61623ab195bd/src/js/locationBar.js#L131
2020-01-28T21:04:15  <gmoss> otherwise your PR looks good and node tests are passing for me. That said, the dev release hasn't solved my issues on the Storytelling Tool. Browser tests pass just fine, but the page doesn't seem to load properly for some reason. Still investigating
2020-01-28T21:04:34  *** clown1 is now known as clown

2020-01-28T21:13:24  <Bosmon> gmoss - that's a pretty horrifying typo
2020-01-28T21:13:40  <Bosmon> It surely causes a failure at runtime?
2020-01-28T21:13:43  <gmoss> Bosmon: do we have linter rules to catch such infusion-specific issues?
2020-01-28T21:14:13  <gmoss> Bosmon: well I can't seem to run the site proper, but the browser tests work. I'm not sure if I'd consider this a runtime issue
2020-01-28T21:14:26  <gmoss> *the site proper = the Storytelling Tool, locally
2020-01-28T21:14:54  <gmoss> fixing that typo in my node_modules copy of gpii-location-bar-relay doesn't seem to affect anything
2020-01-28T21:15:05  <Bosmon> gmoss - that typo should trigger the following: fluid.fail("Cannot parse context reference \"" + reference + "\": Malformed context reference without }");
2020-01-28T21:16:08  <gmoss> Bosmon: I'll run the npm tests for the component again and check the log for that error. I don't recall seeing it as all tests passed
2020-01-28T21:16:14  <Bosmon> I have this feeling that this entire listener must be dead code
2020-01-28T21:18:00  <gmoss> that would explain it. trying to see how that could be the case
2020-01-28T21:18:05  <Bosmon> There's a further faulti n that it listens to "*" rather than ""
2020-01-28T21:19:08  <Bosmon> Yes, there, will be proper authoring supports for this kind of Infusion configuration in time : P
2020-01-28T21:24:50  <gmoss> Bosmon: I feel a touch foolish, the reason it worked in tests but not in practice is that I forgot to add JS file references to the new package :) glad it was an easy one hahaha
2020-01-28T21:24:58  <gmoss> no pressure on the linter, of course!
2020-01-28T21:25:27  <gmoss> *forgot to add said references to the Edit page proper, I did so for the tests
2020-01-28T21:25:54  <gmoss> odd that it failed silently
2020-01-28T21:31:00  <Bosmon> gmoss - well, that's most likely another ancient Infusion convention that needs to be fixed up
2020-01-28T21:31:20  <Bosmon> If you had mentioned the grade as a mixin to some other component, and it wasn't resolved, it would simply remove it silently
2020-01-28T21:31:37  <Bosmon> You only get a hard failure if you mention a non-existent grade as the "principal type" of a component in type: Xxxxxxx
2020-01-28T21:31:51  <gmoss> Bosmon: it was mentioned as the principal type
2020-01-28T21:31:54  <gmoss> *is
2020-01-28T21:32:06  <gmoss> but that is very useful information :)
2020-01-28T21:32:11  <Bosmon> gmoss well, it should have blown up then : P
2020-01-28T21:32:16  <gmoss> ;)
2020-01-28T21:33:06  <Bosmon> You had a component ordinarily written out as a subcomponent, which said plain as day, type: gpii.locationBar?
2020-01-28T21:33:31  <gmoss> yep!
2020-01-28T21:33:50  <Bosmon> and it didn't explode?
2020-01-28T21:33:52  <Bosmon> Very odd
2020-01-28T21:34:05  <gmoss> indeed
2020-01-28T21:34:56  <gmoss> I have it working now which satisfies my needs for the time being :) but it is a curious issue

2020-01-28T23:42:36  <Justin_o> gmoss, Bosmon: just realized I mentioned this morning. GitHub Actions seems like a nice alternative for CI. We have a few projects making use of it now. I'm happy to chat about it more if you like.
2020-01-28T23:55:28  <gmoss> Justin_o, Bosmon: I had a brief chat with simonjb this evening about GitHub Actions and some of its virtues (borne of the mention in here earlier today). I'm going to take a look into it for sure and I'd love to know your thoughts on it. We currently have some Jenkins jobs set up to run tests on build, but that only happens when one of our deployment branches has a commit. simonjb was saying some very interesting
2020-01-28T23:55:28  <gmoss> things about GitHub Actions that could convince me to migrate
2020-01-28T23:57:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'd say it's easier and more transparent to work with than our Jenkins setups and it gives access to other contributors/collaborators to participate in CI as well. I should be in the office tomorrow afternoon, if you'd like to chat more about it.
