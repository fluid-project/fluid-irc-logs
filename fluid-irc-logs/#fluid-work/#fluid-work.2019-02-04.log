2019-02-04T16:23:53  <javjarfer[m]> Hi Bosmon I added a comment in the pull about the issue you were facing
2019-02-04T16:24:47  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] ok thanks, I'm not sure why I didn't consider this simple possibility : P
2019-02-04T16:26:17  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: well, simple options are never so simple when you are in front of so many changes
2019-02-04T16:26:25  <javjarfer[m]> hopefully less changes each day
2019-02-04T16:26:44  <javjarfer[m]> üòÉ
2019-02-04T16:31:21  <javjarfer[m]> (I meant, took me three tests pass failing to remember that the error I was saying was the one prior to writing the Narrator pull, and it was about Narrator settings, and only then, I though... "But.... I already solved this one!!!")
2019-02-04T16:31:45  <javjarfer[m]> "I was seeing"*
2019-02-04T16:35:49  <javjarfer[m]> So, I didn't reached the error by git, but by prior knowledge of the error itself, which makes me think if I should include another paths to my reasoning in the future

2019-02-04T17:26:31  <sgithens>  bryan_ sorry I missed catching up with you before the end of the week on the snapshoter/capture.  I need to hike down in to this volcano crater this morning, but should be back online later in the day.
2019-02-04T17:27:33  <stegru> "sorry I can't work today, I'm entering a volcano"
2019-02-04T17:28:18  <bryan_> sgithens: no worries...I grabbed GPII-3675 and started working in tests

2019-02-04T18:01:43  <bryan_> Sounds awesome...I'm going to Maui in May. I hiked Taal volcano in the Philippines, which is the smallest active volcano in the world, with the largest 3rd order island (island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island in the sea) inside it.
