2020-01-24T11:15:18  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], I was hoping to grab you and @Bosmon at 14:00 CET to talk through how to move forward with "aliases" or whatever we agree to call them
2020-01-24T11:16:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I sent an invite
2020-01-24T11:21:20  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: good morning, sure, it's totally fine with me

2020-01-24T13:00:54  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon and @javjarfer[m], should we do Skype?
2020-01-24T13:03:12  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: Skype is fine for me
2020-01-24T13:03:44  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon?
2020-01-24T13:05:12  <Bosmon> Sure

2020-01-24T13:42:56  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @Bosmon and @javjarfer[m], we do have a small issue in that there's nothing in master that hits the problem at the moment.
2020-01-24T13:43:04  <the-t-in-rtf> Are any of those pulls otherwise ready to merge?
2020-01-24T13:43:15  <Bosmon> Why is that a problem?
2020-01-24T13:43:21  <Bosmon> I am sure you will write adequate tests for it : P
2020-01-24T13:43:21  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@135-23-104-71.cpe.pppoe.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2020-01-24T13:43:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Or I guess I'll have to make a synthetic solution that gets merged in for the tests.
2020-01-24T13:44:00  <the-t-in-rtf> right, I guess the payload tests are mainly what I mean
2020-01-24T13:44:33  <the-t-in-rtf> if there are currently no intra-application transforms, then I'd have to make a sample somewhere
2020-01-24T13:44:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I can stuff one into one of the test solutions.
2020-01-24T13:45:01  <Bosmon> I think there are lots of the simple sort
2020-01-24T13:45:01  <Bosmon> ?
2020-01-24T13:46:20  <the-t-in-rtf> an example would be handy
2020-01-24T13:47:39  <the-t-in-rtf> found one I think
2020-01-24T13:47:40  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/32759c38f9e1a5a38072f8c5e60b02a5d20969d7/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4999
2020-01-24T13:53:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Yup, I can trivially introduce an error by setting the property on the left side.

2020-01-24T18:37:21  <gmoss> michelled cindyli: I have updated the ST spreadsheet and did a few Jira things:
2020-01-24T18:37:21  <gmoss> - SJRK-264 still makes sense, but I've refined its scope a little and proposed a solution
2020-01-24T18:37:21  <gmoss> - SJRK-260 is done, closed it and left a comment about the templates
2020-01-24T18:37:21  <gmoss> - SJRK-265 and SJRK-320 are indeed effectively duplicates, and since I started work on 320 already, I closed 265
2020-01-24T18:37:47  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
2020-01-24T18:37:52  <gmoss> I haven't rearranged anything in the list, mind you, only updated the value in the Priority column
2020-01-24T18:38:17  <michelled> great, thx
