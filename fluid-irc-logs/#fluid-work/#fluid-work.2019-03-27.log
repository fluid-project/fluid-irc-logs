2019-03-27T00:16:27  <jhernandez> stegru: ok, created a recorder-devices installer without the vcredist thing
2019-03-27T00:17:37  <jhernandez> we should be fine now
2019-03-27T00:20:43  <jhernandez> Bosmon: in case you're around - I'm going to build an installer ... how do you feel about including "indicative fix" vs 5 secs timeout?

2019-03-27T12:54:13  <javjarfer[m]> if that configure block is removed, even from "configure" and "restore" only

2019-03-27T12:55:15  <javjarfer[m]> but, if that configure block is present, then every of the expected settings are "undefined"

2019-03-27T13:04:59  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - shouldn't it be in the "update" block as well?
2019-03-27T13:06:08  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - also, I wonder why it is reported as "neverRunning"
2019-03-27T13:06:55  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: didn't knew that the redundancy in the "update" block was mandatory, I can try that
2019-03-27T13:07:05  <javjarfer[m]> oh, the "neverRunning" is older than this pull
2019-03-27T13:07:18  <javjarfer[m]> I don't know how since when that's there
2019-03-27T13:08:54  <Bosmon> OK
2019-03-27T13:09:01  <Bosmon> We could do with understanding what that is for
2019-03-27T13:10:11  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - I was wondering about your strategy for the reset to std PSP transducer
2019-03-27T13:10:22  <Bosmon> Why did it seem that a 2nd relay rule was necessary?
2019-03-27T13:13:16  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: do you have any idea why the cursors implementation have this particular detection implementation? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/5342316164e610628853af66b9ce01b86cf19a0e/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6138
2019-03-27T13:14:23  <Bosmon> This might be a question which only KASPARNET might be able to answer, if he can remember
2019-03-27T13:14:37  <Bosmon> But we should certainly try to experiment with replacing this with "alwaysInstalled" and see what breaks
2019-03-27T13:19:14  <stegru> dunno, javjarfer[m]
2019-03-27T13:22:29  <cindyli> Bosmon: the 2nd relay rule is to know the reset to default is happening, which is when the default settings will be sent to gpii app
2019-03-27T13:24:13  <Bosmon> cindyli - it seems undesirable to special case this
2019-03-27T13:24:14  <cindyli> this is cover the case when resetAtStart is set to false, in which case the reset to standard will not be performed at the system start. in this case i think we should NOT return default settings to gpii app
2019-03-27T13:24:24  <cindyli> ok
2019-03-27T13:24:26  <Bosmon> Why wouldn't we always send the default settings to the GPII app, if they were not recorded in the session?
2019-03-27T13:25:18  <cindyli> because if reset to default is not perfomed, the core doesn't really know what default settings the computer has
2019-03-27T13:25:21  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think there's no point having a special case since in practice resetAtStart = false will never be deployed in production, and in future we will have a better solution for this
2019-03-27T13:25:32  <cindyli> ok

2019-03-27T13:26:12  <cindyli> so, what you are thinking is to replace the empty payload, which happens whenever "noUser" keys in, with default settings?
2019-03-27T13:26:20  <cindyli> Bosmon: ^
2019-03-27T13:27:10  <Bosmon> Just leave a note next to the implementation indicating that we plan to replace it soon with https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3318

2019-03-27T13:27:28  <cindyli> ah ok
2019-03-27T13:27:30  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, just make the most straighforward implementation for now with a link to GPII-3318
2019-03-27T13:27:41  <cindyli> cool. much simpler :)
2019-03-27T13:28:04  <cindyli> dumping my relay work from yesterday...
2019-03-27T13:28:53  <Bosmon> I see you had already implemented GPII-3318 with a mostly complete pull request
2019-03-27T13:29:28  <Bosmon> But in any case, if we ever deploy with resetAtStart = false, our preference will be to implement GPII-3318 properly rather than implement a special-cased relay
2019-03-27T13:29:39  <cindyli> ok
2019-03-27T13:30:21  <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli!
2019-03-27T13:31:14  <cindyli> thank you, Bosmon! for correcting my thoughts
2019-03-27T13:36:28  <Bosmon> Hey there jhernandez - what option did you decide to go with in the end in your installer?
2019-03-27T13:36:51  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey
2019-03-27T13:36:58  <jhernandez> in the end I added both
2019-03-27T13:37:00  <jhernandez> :P
2019-03-27T13:37:19  <Bosmon> jhernandez hahahaha
2019-03-27T13:37:23  <jhernandez> the 5 secs thing "seems" to increase our chances
2019-03-27T13:37:29  <jhernandez> but can't really tell
2019-03-27T13:37:40  <Bosmon> Got time in a bit for a bit of debugging re indicative solution?
2019-03-27T13:37:49  <Bosmon> Since I can't see by eye a way it can fail and I can't make it fail locally any more
2019-03-27T13:37:57  <jhernandez> I think it's a no-op when your indicative fix works fine
2019-03-27T13:38:44  <jhernandez> sure - I was about to leave with dogs now
2019-03-27T13:38:49  <Bosmon> OK, no worries
2019-03-27T13:38:53  <Bosmon> Catch you on ANTI-DOGE
2019-03-27T13:38:56  <jhernandez> so we can meet afterwards
2019-03-27T13:39:01  <jhernandez> sure
2019-03-27T13:39:02  <Bosmon> Also do you have a list of all the branches you merged for the installer?
2019-03-27T13:39:09  <Bosmon> Do any of them look particularly easy to go in master?
2019-03-27T13:40:11  <jhernandez> didn't compile a list (can compile it easily), but yes, some of them can go into master easily for sure
2019-03-27T13:41:09  <jhernandez> I'll compile that list later so we can see our "master" technical debt

2019-03-27T15:43:10  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/761 and https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/254
2019-03-27T15:43:39  <jhernandez> I'd say for now we only need the universal one to get in
2019-03-27T15:43:54  <Bosmon> jhernandez yeah, they'll go in - waiting for stegru to address a couple of minor comments
2019-03-27T15:44:00  <Bosmon> Will the universal one work without the windows one?
2019-03-27T15:44:08  <jhernandez> which in my opinion looks good enough
2019-03-27T15:44:09  <stegru> ok ok
2019-03-27T15:44:24  <jhernandez> Bosmon: it will because the installer includes the windows side
2019-03-27T15:44:49  <jhernandez> (THE CLIENT)
2019-03-27T15:45:05  <jhernandez> and the universal side it's the SR that runs in THE SERVER
2019-03-27T15:45:21  <Bosmon> jhernandez - there is no SR in the server
2019-03-27T15:45:30  <jhernandez> in the cloud-based flowmanager?

2019-03-27T18:29:41  <javjarfer[m]> I think that the fact of including it in the second configure block of that solution, makes the first common term used in the previous configure block be badly detected
2019-03-27T18:30:09  <javjarfer[m]> I don't know if it could a bug in the transformations
2019-03-27T18:32:46  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: the community meeting is starting soon :)

2019-03-27T18:35:02  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i'm not sure where are "the second configure block of that solution" and "the previous configure block" you referred to. but this "capabilities" is unnecessary because it's already specified in the "capabilitiesTransformations" block https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/5342316164e610628853af66b9ce01b86cf19a0e/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6120

2019-03-27T18:36:11  <cindyli> the "capabilities" definition is only required when the common or application specific terms you'd like to be handled in the settings are not showing in the transformation defined in the "capabilitiesTransformations"
2019-03-27T18:36:26  <cindyli> such as windows high contrast
2019-03-27T18:37:09  <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/5342316164e610628853af66b9ce01b86cf19a0e/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6521-L6548

2019-03-27T18:38:57  <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok, I see that stegru has addressed your comments on https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/254
2019-03-27T18:44:00  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli , okay, I see, I just used the capabilities block there because of being desperate of finding something that influenced the result.   The previous configuration block I am referring is "configure" block, and the next one is "configureMouseThickness"
2019-03-27T18:45:02  <javjarfer[m]> So, I think including a transform into the second block is influencing the first one
2019-03-27T18:45:12  <javjarfer[m]> Hope that's better stated

2019-03-27T18:47:51  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: do you mean "capabilitiesTransformations" block defined in "configureCursorThickness" block is affecting the transformation result of "capabilitiesTransformations" from the "configure" block?
2019-03-27T18:48:19  <cindyli> if it does, i think there's a bug
2019-03-27T18:49:22  <cindyli> it would be really helpful if you could create a branch to demonstrate the problem, javjarfer[m]

2019-03-27T19:09:29  <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes I and the CATE will jump on it!
2019-03-27T19:10:24  <jhernandez> and the CATE!!!!
2019-03-27T19:14:23  <stegru> jhernandez, the shutdown option wouldn't be a documented thing, or have a desktop icon - just something that the installer would run before starting
2019-03-27T19:18:48  <jhernandez> stegru: ok ok, I wasn't sure about your intentions in this
2019-03-27T19:19:09  <jhernandez> yes, that's something we can definitely do
2019-03-27T19:28:58  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli , yes, that very same pull failed in CI with the issue I was describing
2019-03-27T19:33:10  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: which pull is it?
2019-03-27T20:01:42  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes, sry for the delay, it's pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/762/files
2019-03-27T20:03:30  <cindyli> ok, thanks, javjarfer[m], how urgent is it?

2019-03-27T20:10:22  <javjarfer[m]> But I wanted to understand the source of the issue, just in case can affect other things
2019-03-27T20:10:51  <javjarfer[m]> I can try to confirm the source of the source of the issue
2019-03-27T20:11:10  <javjarfer[m]> Or fix the bug if confirmed
2019-03-27T20:14:36  <jhernandez> stegru: I was testing the new installer in a rotten parallels vm and I stumbled upon this https://pastebin.com/L3pDd77z

2019-03-27T20:14:58  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i may not have time to get to it before leaving next week. if you have time to debug, you probably wanna pay attention to this function - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/transformer/src/js/Transformer.js#L55-L84
2019-03-27T20:15:22  <cindyli> line 75-77 is where "capabilities" block is handled
2019-03-27T20:22:01  <jhernandez> stegru: let me know if you want further info, the problem happens all the time and it results in an endless morphic crashing-restarting cycle
2019-03-27T20:24:31  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: that's great, thanks a lot for the pointer, I will be taking a look to it tomorrow!!!
