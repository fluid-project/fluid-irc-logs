2019-04-15T08:12:00  <javjarfer> hi there, good morning stegru
2019-04-15T09:06:34  <stegru> hi javjarfer
2019-04-15T09:37:23  *** jhernandez <jhernandez!~jhernande@2a02:a03f:3ee2:5d00:cce0:9e64:d388:2db1> has joined #fluid-work
2019-04-15T10:29:49  <javjarfer> hi stegru sorry, needed to leave for 30 min
2019-04-15T10:29:59  <stegru> it's ok
2019-04-15T10:30:57  <javjarfer> Just wanted to talk with you about the new settings, the volume and brightness
2019-04-15T10:31:43  <javjarfer> so, I just made a couple of little changes to the "brightness" solution, in the "isInstalled" block
2019-04-15T10:31:49  <stegru> ok
2019-04-15T10:32:00  <javjarfer> so device reporter informs when the solution isn't available in the system
2019-04-15T10:32:07  <javjarfer> I think it's the best approach
2019-04-15T10:32:26  <stegru> yes, I also think so
2019-04-15T10:32:31  <javjarfer> Gregg asked me if we can inform the user when the feature is not available due to system limitations, and I think that's the best change for that
2019-04-15T10:32:43  <javjarfer> okay, then I will create a small issue with the patch
2019-04-15T10:33:51  <stegru> I'm not sure how that can be done
2019-04-15T10:33:59  <stegru> informing the user
2019-04-15T10:36:02  <javjarfer> I think that should be done from UI consuming device reporter output and modifying QSS behavior
2019-04-15T10:38:42  <jhernandez> javjarfer: stegru are there any UI specs for these controls?
2019-04-15T10:38:56  <jhernandez> (brightness and volume)
2019-04-15T10:39:28  <javjarfer> ``` If we can then we can just dim out that control or show a message that “This monitor’s brightness cannot be controlled from this computer. ```
2019-04-15T10:40:06  <javjarfer> that's the only information about it I have, it's from I mail I shared with Gregg about the feature on Friday
2019-04-15T10:41:33  <javjarfer> also stegru, I have been started writing the volumeup, I think the easiest approach is forgetting about API for audio devices (or audio streams whatever), and going for "keybd_event"
2019-04-15T10:46:29  <javjarfer> sorry jhernandez , I didn't completed my answer, they are supposed to work like current "scaling" menu of QSS
2019-04-15T10:47:00  <stegru> keybd_event to sent the volume key presses?
2019-04-15T10:47:20  <javjarfer> stegru, yes
2019-04-15T10:47:27  <javjarfer> what do you think about it?
2019-04-15T10:48:28  <stegru> well, it's a shit idea unless you don't care about what the current volume is
2019-04-15T10:48:47  <javjarfer> stegru, the specs says nothing about the current volume
2019-04-15T10:48:57  <javjarfer> just volume up, volume down, and mute
2019-04-15T10:49:19  <stegru> shouldn't there be some feedback if the volume is all the way up and the button is pressed?
2019-04-15T10:49:36  <javjarfer> stegru, windows doesn't do that
2019-04-15T10:50:02  <javjarfer> well, I think if we use that, windows will be responsible of the feedback displaying the current volume
2019-04-15T10:51:23  <javjarfer> but you gave me some thoughts stegru, Gregg has been talking of volume as a setting... this would make it a command in our terminology
2019-04-15T10:51:36  <stegru> yes
2019-04-15T10:51:55  <javjarfer> even if the spec of the current use matches this, I don't know if it will be required to be a setting in the future
2019-04-15T10:52:16  <stegru> but I think they'll want the up/down button to flash red when it's at the end of the scale
2019-04-15T10:52:40  <javjarfer> okay, that detail changes everything
2019-04-15T10:52:56  <javjarfer> going for the audio API then, thanks stegru

2019-04-15T10:59:50  <javjarfer> stegru, thanks for the link, EndpointVolume API was my first choice
2019-04-15T11:33:16  <javjarfer> stegru, since this API is not native to the .Net Framework and should be accessed using CoCreateInstance(https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/desktop/CoreAudio/header-files-and-system-components)
2019-04-15T11:33:27  <javjarfer> I think we should go full native with it
2019-04-15T11:48:10  <stegru> in a separate executable?
2019-04-15T11:53:09  <javjarfer> that would be the faster approach yes, but maybe I can manage to move it to C#... but since it should be ready within beginning this week...
2019-04-15T11:55:06  <javjarfer> stegru, have you moved something not native to .NET Framework to C# before?

2019-04-15T12:08:46  <stegru> yes.. sort of
2019-04-15T12:09:12  <stegru> jhernandez, if he wants this in by next week maybe it would be ok to just have the key press?
2019-04-15T12:09:18  <stegru> sorry, i mean javjarfer
2019-04-15T12:10:22  <stegru> or I think using WM_APPCOMMAND (not sure on the details of this)
2019-04-15T12:11:24  <javjarfer> stegru, yes, that was another possible approach, I left the messages/keys implementation in favor of this, I think I can even have the executable approach ready for today
2019-04-15T12:11:38  <javjarfer> but... I wont for sure have the C# version so soon
2019-04-15T12:12:30  <javjarfer> I can check the specs in a mail with Gregg asking for the current requirements, if a setting is not required yet, the keypress/messages should be enough

2019-04-15T13:23:04  <stegru> do whatever pleases you the most, javjarfer.. and what you think will best match Gregg's expectations
2019-04-15T13:23:23  <stegru> binary for what, anyway?
2019-04-15T13:28:33  <javjarfer> getting/setting system volume
2019-04-15T13:45:55  <javjarfer> stegru, sorry, didn't mentioned you
2019-04-15T13:46:09  <stegru> ok
2019-04-15T13:51:44  <stegru> ah javjarfer.. I wonder if implementing this would be quicker than implementing the child-process handling:
2019-04-15T13:51:45  <stegru> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4640106/get-the-current-system-volume-in-windows-7/21056089#21056089
2019-04-15T13:52:05  <stegru> I think this has the com crap you need
2019-04-15T13:52:51  <stegru> why must a simple thing be so difficult
2019-04-15T13:53:02  <javjarfer> hahaha yes stegru , exactly
2019-04-15T13:53:15  <javjarfer> that needs the COM stuff...
2019-04-15T13:53:32  <javjarfer> didn't expected it really, but you know, they always surprise
2019-04-15T13:53:51  <javjarfer> so it looks like after Vista the access to this stuff was moved to COM interfaces
2019-04-15T13:54:15  <javjarfer> I was really surprised to see that wasn't added to .Net to accessing the stuff from C#
2019-04-15T13:54:17  <javjarfer> but....
2019-04-15T13:54:35  <stegru> yeh, same here
2019-04-15T13:57:57  <stegru> ah, I think "MCI" was the thing that was used in windows 3.11, when I last did this
2019-04-15T13:58:30  <stegru> oh no, that's for playing media

2019-04-15T14:01:23  <stegru> doesn't look simple

2019-04-15T15:41:35  <greatislander> colinclark this afternoon is not great; I have a number of appointments basically every two hours starting at 1 Eastern. Tomorrow I have nothing scheduled so that would probably be better
2019-04-15T15:41:45  <greatislander> easier to find a time!
2019-04-15T15:41:48  <colinclark> yeah

2019-04-15T15:42:13  <colinclark> worst case, i’ll defer to you to meet with Rylan and you can fill me in
2019-04-15T15:42:15  <greatislander> Okay. I could do between 2pm-2pm Eastern today
2019-04-15T15:42:20  <greatislander> in a pinch!
2019-04-15T15:42:24  <colinclark> hahaha
