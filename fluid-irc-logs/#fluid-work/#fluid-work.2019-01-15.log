2019-01-15T12:34:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I think we should talk about account management first
2019-01-15T12:34:11  <the-t-in-rtf> and then if we don't have much to discuss you can go
2019-01-15T12:34:20  <cindyli> cool. thanks

2019-01-15T13:03:34  <Bosmon> Hi everyone - worryingly, I am now totally unable to run the universal test suite in its own Linux VM
2019-01-15T13:03:41  <Bosmon> I get the following timing-related failure: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3636
2019-01-15T13:04:59  <Bosmon> Which is something I've sometimes seen in Windows, but more usually when I have run into memory exhaustion

2019-01-15T13:34:49  <Bosmon> OK, I have got GPII-3636 three times in a row now in Linux
2019-01-15T13:35:48  <Bosmon> But I can actually run the UserLogonHandlersTests.js tests by themselves in isolation
2019-01-15T13:36:13  <Bosmon> So this does suggest that we are running into a load-dependent timing failure like the one I was hunting in GPII-3630

2019-01-15T14:00:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems i was mistaken about there being an issue between the schema and starter grades version. well i guess there may still be an issue, but the problem exists in the UIO demo (using the schema) without any interaction with the starter grades. If i make change to the preferences, they are applied. Reloading the page keeps them. But when I open the sliding panel (this is when the prefs editor is created because of
2019-01-15T14:00:57  <Justin_o> the lazy loading option) the settings are reset. I'm still digging through things. What I've observed so far is that the settings from the cookie don't seem to be getting applied to the model. So the initial model is being saved back to the cookie in effect; which is to say an empty model. I wonder if the model relays I setup are having some side effects with the remote model component.
2019-01-15T14:01:49  <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool, good investigation!
2019-01-15T14:04:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the other thing I noticed was that if you set the preference in the starter grade version, it doesn't apply to the schema version. However, the reverse is true ( when the aliases are setup to match the starter grades).
2019-01-15T14:05:09  <Justin_o> This seems due to the fact that the starter grades only store to a single model value location, and the schema version prioritizes the generated model path over the alias.

2019-01-15T14:21:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i'm looking at the component tree in the browser console. I see that in the options there is a model and it has an array. It looks like this array is the order to merge the various model values. So I see at index 3 there is the implicit model relays I've setup for the alias values. at index 4 is a general model relays to share the model values up to the separatedPanel parent grade including `preferences:
2019-01-15T14:21:48  <Justin_o> "{separatedPanel}.model.preferences"`
2019-01-15T14:22:38  <Justin_o> would that last declaration at wipe out the implicit model relays?
2019-01-15T14:23:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that declaration *is* an implicit model relay
2019-01-15T14:24:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i mean the previous ones from index 3.
2019-01-15T14:24:22  <Justin_o> The aliases are all inside of the `preferences` model path.
2019-01-15T14:24:40  <Bosmon> Justin_o - all the relays will be active, none will get wiped out
2019-01-15T14:24:57  <Justin_o> okay thanks, so i'll check somewhere else for what might be the cause
2019-01-15T14:25:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, does that mean you can't override an implicit model relay?
2019-01-15T14:25:27  <Bosmon> Justin_o - correct, yes
2019-01-15T14:25:48  <Bosmon> Rather upsetting limitation of the system, but there it is
2019-01-15T14:25:55  <Justin_o> okay, that's good to know.. maybe we've chatted about that before.. it's starting to ring a bell

2019-01-15T17:55:38  <Bosmon> Hi there bryan_ - I am thinking that a good place to assign you next is to pair up with sgithens in his current work on the Capture Tool
2019-01-15T17:55:47  <Bosmon> It could work quite well because the two of you are in the same timezone
2019-01-15T17:56:10  <Bosmon> And I think it would be very helpful for him to give someone a tour of his code, and for him to get some help in getting it commit- and review-worthy
2019-01-15T17:56:37  <sgithens> Bosmon: sure
2019-01-15T17:56:44  <Bosmon> sgithens, bryan_ - do you think the two of you could come up with a slot where the two of you can pair?
2019-01-15T17:56:55  <Bosmon> And also come up with some notes from your session in a gpii pad :)
2019-01-15T17:57:25  <bryan_> Sounds like a plan
2019-01-15T17:57:33  <Bosmon> That's great
2019-01-15T17:58:02  <Bosmon> It looks like Astea's new partners are likely to have the QS work covered for a while
2019-01-15T17:58:19  <Bosmon> And so the next area we are thin is in the Capture Tool, since we have only one dev familiar with the code so far
2019-01-15T17:58:38  <sgithens> Bosmon bryan_ I'm assembling it up, along with some of the gpii-handebars changes for colinclark today, but maybe in another day or so I should be ready to meet and run through it
2019-01-15T17:59:48  <bryan_> Ok let me know. Is there a ticket or doc I can look at first?
2019-01-15T18:00:15  <sgithens> bryan_ there are some specs
2019-01-15T18:00:30  <sgithens> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mAP3sZYVV1extBQ3f3HwEPgb3K-S7PFn5BNBBH2aFRo/edit#heading=h.8oq71zyzqvvr
2019-01-15T18:00:47  <bryan_> Thanks
2019-01-15T18:00:53  <Bosmon> sgithens - and you've got some old stuff checked in somewhere, right, that bryan_ could be looking at in the meantime?
2019-01-15T18:01:08  <sgithens> and it's a bit older, but there is working, mostly accurate prototype
2019-01-15T18:01:10  <sgithens> https://vjv8j9.axshare.com/#g=1&p=capture_tool
2019-01-15T18:01:18  <sgithens> old stuff?
2019-01-15T18:02:05  <bryan_> Like any committed code
2019-01-15T18:02:13  <Bosmon> Yeah, that :)
2019-01-15T18:02:19  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@205.211.168.102> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-15T18:02:41  <sgithens> I just finished that prototype for the arch meeting last week.   Should have it pushed up in the next couple hours
2019-01-15T18:02:51  <Bosmon> Ah yes
2019-01-15T18:02:57  <Bosmon> But he could look at the PPT code, right?
2019-01-15T18:03:05  <Bosmon> Which is based on quite similar patterns?
2019-01-15T18:03:05  <sgithens> oh sure
2019-01-15T18:03:10  <sgithens> sort of
2019-01-15T18:03:16  <sgithens> except it's a webapp
2019-01-15T18:03:37  <bryan_> I'll get started with the docs and the prototype for now
2019-01-15T18:03:40  <sgithens> there are two parts:
2019-01-15T18:04:01  <colinclark> thanks sgithens, I'm really looking forward to see how you've integrated gpii-handlebars/binder with Electron
2019-01-15T18:04:12  <sgithens> this universal pull, which cindyli just left me some new comments on:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/634
2019-01-15T18:05:40  <sgithens> and then this, which once I'm finished upgrading to the new gpii-handelbars, will submit for another review:  https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-devpmt/tree/GPII-2452-proofing
2019-01-15T18:05:55  <sgithens> I'm working through a few things with the-t-in-rtf on it at the moment
2019-01-15T18:07:11  <colinclark> we're so lucky to have the-t-in-rtf and Bosmon working on these reusable libraries for us
2019-01-15T18:07:38  <colinclark> even if I am still using fluid.stringTemplate as my renderer, I know I can always switch at a moment's notice
2019-01-15T18:08:02  <sgithens> colinclark: Or like a day or twos notice for sure
2019-01-15T18:08:10  <colinclark> ha, yes
2019-01-15T18:08:25  <colinclark> these things take time, as I am being reminded during this residency

2019-01-15T18:17:50  <sgithens> should also be pushed up by the end of the day

2019-01-15T19:32:28  <cindyli> hi jhernandez, r u there?
2019-01-15T19:34:00  <colinclark> sgithens: I finally got burned again by the Electron node integration issues...
2019-01-15T19:34:36  <colinclark> with AMD-style scripts that attempt to use Electron's exposed require/define/module globals
2019-01-15T19:34:38  <colinclark> such as jQuery and Flocking, etc.
2019-01-15T19:35:11  <colinclark> infusion-electron now ships by default with nodeIntegration: false for security reasons, by I finally had the need to access the Electron API from the renderer process (to open a file dialog)
2019-01-15T19:35:27  <colinclark> so my current solution is simply to namespace all of Electron's node integration globals
2019-01-15T19:35:40  <colinclark> and then to delete them
2019-01-15T19:36:00  <colinclark> window.electronNodeIntegration = { require: require, etc.
2019-01-15T19:36:21  <jhernandez> cindyli: more or less
2019-01-15T19:36:21  <colinclark> I'll roll up a script in infusion-electron intended to be included in all pages that does this
2019-01-15T19:36:32  <colinclark> Or do you have a more generalized solution, sgithens?
2019-01-15T19:36:52  <jhernandez> sup?
2019-01-15T19:37:56  <cindyli> jhernandez: nvm. i figured out. thanks

2019-01-15T20:49:09  <colinclark> It seems to me that, in the Renderer process, one simply shouldn't be using Electron's require at all...
2019-01-15T20:49:25  <colinclark> unless the script explicitly knows that it's Electron's weird implementation
2019-01-15T20:49:37  <colinclark> and not what's provided in a standard Chromium browser, for example
2019-01-15T20:49:45  <colinclark> but perhaps I'm missing a use case somewhere
2019-01-15T20:50:22  <colinclark> this is my script: https://github.com/colinbdclark/bubbles/blob/gh-7-ii/src/renderer-process/js/namespace-electron-globals.js
