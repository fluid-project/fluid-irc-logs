2019-02-18T08:50:04  <Danail_Dido> Bosmon, I know that you are probably quite busy, but can you spend a bit of time on the "default setting" PR - this one is very small, but we needed for amost every other task, so it will be great if its part of the master branch. Pretty please!
2019-02-18T08:52:14  <Danail_Dido> jhernandez, thank you for the update last week, the cursor size setting its working just fine indeed! So we have a working setting in the Adjust Menu now!

2019-02-18T10:41:12  <jhernandez> Danail_Dido: hey, so glad to hear that!
2019-02-18T10:44:08  <jhernandez> regarding the other mouse settings, we have a PR almost ready to be merged -> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/741
2019-02-18T10:47:58  <jhernandez> after that one is merged (along with the windows side of it), you will need to update a few things in your side
2019-02-18T10:49:36  <jhernandez> 1) SwapMouseButtons should receive either 0 or 1 (rather than true a false)
2019-02-18T10:52:03  <jhernandez> 2) Easier double click involves dealing with 3 settings: MouseDoubleClickTime, MouseDoubleClickWidth and MouseDoubleClickHeight
2019-02-18T10:53:22  <jhernandez> the rest should be working as expected
2019-02-18T10:53:28  <jhernandez> Danail_Dido: ^

2019-02-18T11:18:07  <jhernandez> sure, let's see if we can get that one merged for tomorrow so you don't have to do any juggling with git branches to test it ;)
2019-02-18T11:43:04  <jhernandez> stegru: hey there
2019-02-18T11:43:13  <stegru> hola
2019-02-18T11:43:35  <jhernandez> re windows service instability, yeah, I will find the time
2019-02-18T11:44:30  <stegru> ok, no rush. I think I've found one problem, related to the firewall warning - and I can also reproduce the tray button not showing
2019-02-18T11:44:45  <jhernandez> but, one problem, that is not only related to the windows service, and that I think is worth looking at, is that the trayButton disappears
2019-02-18T11:45:18  <stegru> yep - haven't looked into it yet, but it happened after I updated windows
2019-02-18T11:45:49  <jhernandez> did you see my last comment on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3705?focusedCommentId=37102&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-37102
2019-02-18T11:45:53  <jhernandez> ?
2019-02-18T11:46:18  <jhernandez> maybe we should just wait a bit more to launch the trayButton?
2019-02-18T11:47:05  <jhernandez> oh, the firewall warning thing, interesting
2019-02-18T11:47:14  <jhernandez> didn't get any of it
2019-02-18T11:48:07  <jhernandez> the other thing that happens with and without the service is https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3704
2019-02-18T11:49:13  <stegru> ok
2019-02-18T12:17:22  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there stegru
2019-02-18T12:17:28  <javjarfer[m]> Are you available?
2019-02-18T12:17:31  <stegru> hola
2019-02-18T12:17:34  <stegru> yes?
2019-02-18T12:19:29  <javjarfer[m]> hi there! Just wondering if we should unify the mouseSettings in the SR
2019-02-18T12:19:52  <javjarfer[m]> I saw that there are 3 different solutions that we could unify in "windows.mouseSettings"
2019-02-18T12:20:18  <javjarfer[m]> like this one https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5829
2019-02-18T12:20:31  <javjarfer[m]> and this one https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5695
2019-02-18T12:22:11  <stegru> I have no preference either way. what problem would it solve?
2019-02-18T12:22:46  <javjarfer[m]> well, none, but looks kind of weird having those preferences outside the common block of mouse options
2019-02-18T12:24:56  <stegru> it doesn't bother me, see what the-t-in-rtf1 thinks
2019-02-18T12:25:51  <javjarfer[m]> me neither but was thinking that it may make sgithens life more easy, what do you think the-t-in-rtf1 ?

2019-02-18T12:26:51  <the-t-in-rtf1> you could make the same argument for consolidating all OS settings, as we don't for example break down how JAWS handles one type of setting versus another.
2019-02-18T12:27:06  <the-t-in-rtf1> I would indeed run it by Steve Githens
2019-02-18T12:27:36  <the-t-in-rtf1> it may be that his work would benefit from more solutions with less settings, or less solutions with more settings
2019-02-18T12:28:14  <the-t-in-rtf1> right now there's nothing to force us to act in either way, we can do what's most convenient for those involved.
2019-02-18T12:29:06  <the-t-in-rtf1> I have my own opinion about what's tidier, but I think Steve is a better arbiter in this case... ;)
2019-02-18T12:30:22  <the-t-in-rtf1> if he doesn't care, then it's what makes it easiest to read and maintain them among the team doing it, IMO
2019-02-18T12:30:35  <the-t-in-rtf1> eventually I'll have to make some system of reuse and break things down, and then it'll matter more
2019-02-18T12:30:57  <the-t-in-rtf1> but the decisions that will need to be made then shouldn't slow anyone down now
2019-02-18T12:31:47  <the-t-in-rtf1> In other words, if Steve Githens doesn't need it one way or another, I'm fine with your proposal.
2019-02-18T12:32:51  <the-t-in-rtf1> we have lots of options in the "generated solutions registry" era to remap and reorganise stuff
2019-02-18T12:33:19  <the-t-in-rtf1> so if we for example decide to group all windows settings, we have a new version of our schemas and a simple transform to migrate the reorganised settings
2019-02-18T12:37:10  <the-t-in-rtf1> We might also want to discuss having some kind of grouping metadata as an additional layer, we've discussed that with him.
2019-02-18T12:37:54  <the-t-in-rtf1> it'd be good to see if he's done anything there as well.
2019-02-18T12:39:25  <the-t-in-rtf1> by grouping metadata I mean like making a list of all mouse-related solutions and settings and presenting that to the user instead of a list of solutions and their settings

2019-02-18T13:57:05  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, I am writing up some stuff on deployment management for the Wednesday meeting.
2019-02-18T13:57:19  <the-t-in-rtf> just wanted to confirm how much info about the cloud endpoints lives in the installer you create.
2019-02-18T13:57:43  <the-t-in-rtf> so, for example, if we had a QA cloud, would you need to make a QA client, or can QA set some environment variables?
2019-02-18T13:57:55  <the-t-in-rtf> on each machine that's being used for testing, I mean
2019-02-18T13:59:01  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, I also want to know if Steve has done similar job into that, I guess will be better to hear directly from him in this case before taking action. Thanks
2019-02-18T13:59:13  <the-t-in-rtf> which Steve?
2019-02-18T13:59:31  <javjarfer[m]> Githens
2019-02-18T14:00:15  <the-t-in-rtf> so maybe you can explain what you mean by "similar job"
2019-02-18T14:00:26  <the-t-in-rtf> using the standard installer with a dev environment or QA cloud?
2019-02-18T14:00:31  <the-t-in-rtf> creating installers?
2019-02-18T14:01:18  <javjarfer[m]> no,  sorry, the-t-in-rtf I was talking of the previos messages about grouping settings in the SR
2019-02-18T14:01:25  <the-t-in-rtf> oooooo
2019-02-18T14:01:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I was VERY confused
2019-02-18T14:01:37  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, dang it!
2019-02-18T14:01:41  <javjarfer[m]> not about your question to jhernandez
2019-02-18T14:01:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I was at mentioning the other JJ and got excited
2019-02-18T14:01:50  <the-t-in-rtf> I understand now
2019-02-18T14:02:23  <the-t-in-rtf> If there's ever another Tony he and I will wrestle for it and the other will use their middle name.
2019-02-18T14:02:36  <the-t-in-rtf> or I guess she, but ladies usually use an "i"
2019-02-18T14:06:07  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, the other Javi, thankfully we only have one JJ
2019-02-18T14:06:11  <the-t-in-rtf> that'd be bonkers
2019-02-18T14:08:57  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "sorry, the other Javi, thankfull"> hahaha
2019-02-18T14:09:39  <javjarfer[m]> 2 Javis, and 2 JJs that would never lead to confusion
2019-02-18T14:13:21  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, you around yet, I already have the next question
2019-02-18T14:14:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Maybe someone else knows, I just want to know if we generally publish our installers so that they can be downloaded from somewhere.
2019-02-18T14:17:04  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: re your first question - we only point our client to point to flowmanager.prd.gcp.gpii.net
2019-02-18T14:17:14  <jhernandez> *to use
2019-02-18T14:17:42  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, good to know.
2019-02-18T14:18:11  <jhernandez> that's all - so yes, you can change en env variable and perform tests against a particular cloud, i.e.: flowmanager.dev-jhernandez.gcp.gpii.net
2019-02-18T14:19:12  <jhernandez> re the 2nd question, no, at this moment, we don't have a public "Get Morphic" place since, you know, it's not ready yet
2019-02-18T14:20:31  <jhernandez> at this moment, the installers are living in Goggle Drive
2019-02-18T14:20:39  <jhernandez> *Google
2019-02-18T14:20:57  <the-t-in-rtf> ok, but there's still a URL QA could presumably use to download the client?
2019-02-18T14:21:06  <jhernandez> always
2019-02-18T14:21:08  <jhernandez> :)
2019-02-18T14:21:14  <the-t-in-rtf> great, that's what I want to build into the process
2019-02-18T14:21:27  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. they shouldn't be notified that there's a new client and then have to wait to bug you
2019-02-18T14:21:30  <jhernandez> I mean, at this moment, the client comes from my computer
2019-02-18T14:21:35  <the-t-in-rtf> you should be able to say "here"
2019-02-18T14:21:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't care how the release gets to a URL, only that there is one
2019-02-18T14:21:52  <the-t-in-rtf> we can mature that process as needed
2019-02-18T14:21:52  <jhernandez> yup
2019-02-18T14:22:04  <jhernandez> it was just an FYI
2019-02-18T14:22:53  <the-t-in-rtf> no, it's good info, I just mean, nothing there that I'm trying to change until you want it to change
2019-02-18T14:23:17  <jhernandez> yeah, my goal is to automate this as much as possible when the process is "stable"
2019-02-18T14:23:21  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-02-18T14:23:38  <jhernandez> there are always loose ends that prevent us from doing such thing
2019-02-18T14:23:54  <jhernandez> but step by step, we're getting closer and closre
2019-02-18T14:26:03  <the-t-in-rtf> so, this might be slightly controversial, as it implies having more tickets, but I'm thinking of making a "forward or fail" workflow instead of a constant "back and forth" workflow
2019-02-18T14:26:58  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. there is a specific version of the client and cloud under test, and either we reach the point where that version is ready to deploy to production, or we kick it back to the devs to make a new release
2019-02-18T14:27:15  <the-t-in-rtf> no fussing around under the hood and then shouting "try it now!"
2019-02-18T14:27:34  <the-t-in-rtf> it'll be much easier to automate, for starters, and also avoids these head-breakingly long tickets
2019-02-18T14:28:40  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I know we don't have a process for this yet, but I guess the way things work we'd need a "create QA client" step with the QA cloud settings, and a later "create prod client" step?
2019-02-18T14:29:01  <the-t-in-rtf> or could we have environment variables on a QA machine that use the prod client with QA?
2019-02-18T14:30:02  <jhernandez> yeah, that's what we do right now - when there is a no go, we create a new client and ask QA to test again when it's ready
2019-02-18T14:30:11  <the-t-in-rtf> perfect
2019-02-18T14:30:20  <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess they currently test against the prod cloud
2019-02-18T14:30:27  <jhernandez> yup
2019-02-18T14:30:29  <the-t-in-rtf> my question is, if we had a QA cloud, how could it work?
2019-02-18T14:30:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm hoping they can just test with the prod client and environment variables
2019-02-18T14:31:18  <jhernandez> I'd say that before testing the client, there could be a battery of tests in universal that can be ran against the cloud
2019-02-18T14:32:34  <jhernandez> and then, yeah, installing the client and try to come up with a battery of tests that exercises the client with that cloud
2019-02-18T14:34:40  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a good point for the QA deployment
2019-02-18T14:35:06  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds like a good step between that and asking QA to test
2019-02-18T14:36:42  <the-t-in-rtf> so in whatever order the client and qa deployment happen, before manual QA we have an automated step where you run the client tests against the QA cloud
2019-02-18T14:39:07  * jhernandez nods
2019-02-18T14:39:21  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: in any case, let me know if you want to have a call about this
2019-02-18T14:39:36  <the-t-in-rtf> sure, just making myself notes now
2019-02-18T14:39:48  <the-t-in-rtf> I also need to refresh my memory about what's currently possible to track
2019-02-18T14:39:53  <jhernandez> yeah, sure
2019-02-18T14:40:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I may write it up as a keynote diagram for the meeting
2019-02-18T14:40:11  <the-t-in-rtf> rather than actually making an issue type yet
2019-02-18T14:40:13  <the-t-in-rtf> we'll see
