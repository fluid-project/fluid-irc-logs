2019-12-18T13:53:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have a couple of base grades that have an option set to an empty array. In the grade that is using them, I want to override the option with an expander.
2019-12-18T13:53:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it seems that the expander is being ignore and the original array is being returned. Is this expected?

2019-12-18T14:10:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I tried a setting prop to just a plain object in the parent. The result is the same. So I guess you can't override an array with any object. But I'm still not sure if that is expected behaviour.

I'm fixing the tests and realized that there was some expectations of options supplied from the builder baked into the base grades, that I'm trying

2019-12-18T16:20:22  <Bosmon> gmoss - just looking into your failure to relocalise the UIO panels live
2019-12-18T16:20:35  <Bosmon> I notice in your "demo" file there's a priority reference to a namespace which isn't defined anywhere - https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/d6b05186d0f962a5d6c1d1ef4f0723675a4a142d/src/ui/UIOMultilingualDemo.js#L49
2019-12-18T16:20:41  <Bosmon> Perhaps there's a bit of incomplete infrastructure here?
2019-12-18T16:22:46  <gmoss> Bosmon: good spotting! That there is a bit of cruft. The namespace used to exist but no longer does. I was also looking yesterday and planned to continue today into the IOC reference for the listener being distributed in the base page grade
2019-12-18T16:23:09  <gmoss> (on the subway or I'd send line links)
2019-12-18T16:24:19  <gmoss> I'd very much like to either remove or rename that file and grade
2019-12-18T16:24:28  <Bosmon> Yes, the name is a bit misleading
2019-12-18T16:25:47  <gmoss> Bosmon: it was one of those things from early on in development that never got solved, other work was always more important. We'll solve this before we merge into master, of course
2019-12-18T16:25:57  <Bosmon> No worries
2019-12-18T16:26:04  <Bosmon> It looks like we are very close to having this working in any case
2019-12-18T16:26:09  <gmoss> Excellent!
2019-12-18T16:26:17  <Bosmon> Then we can focus on streamlining the process a bit

2019-12-18T16:43:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o, gmoss - so I can see what is preventing UIO from relocalising live
2019-12-18T16:43:51  <Bosmon> Which is probably indeed connected to gmoss' missing event listener
2019-12-18T16:44:51  <Bosmon> Right now there are two ways of using ResourceLoader resources - the "dynamic path" involves referring to them regardless of whether they have loaded, via a model reference or a messageResolver reference, etc.
2019-12-18T16:45:19  <Bosmon> And the "static path" involves the pattern that we generally use in UIO since its usage of ResourceLoaders is based on the legacy system, whereby you explicitly wait for the onResourcesLoaded event to fire
2019-12-18T16:45:35  <Bosmon> In the static path you simply get the value of the resource as it has loaded and don't get the benefit of any dynamic updates

2019-12-18T16:46:38  <Bosmon> So every UIO panel has one of these attached: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L74

2019-12-18T16:49:15  <Bosmon> It gets its "messageBase" via this distribution: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L82
2019-12-18T16:50:53  <Bosmon> Now all of these messageBase values get baked into the component via the AuxBuilder here: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6145/src/framework/preferences/js/AuxBuilder.js#L474
2019-12-18T16:52:28  <Bosmon> Although there seems to be some confusion here since it looks like these panels separately inherit directly from the parent bundle via the prefsEditorConnections grade: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L655
2019-12-18T16:52:57  <Bosmon> I think the best thing to do would be to hoist an actual test case demonstrating relocalisation into the core framework, which would then be more than a "demo" : p
2019-12-18T16:53:43  <Bosmon> My suspicion that the best way of fixing this is to improve the strategy in the AuxBuilder which implies some core work by Justin_o

2019-12-18T16:54:07  <Bosmon> I'm not quite clear how/if this relocalisation ever worked in the SJRK demo, I can't see a mechanism for it at present : P
2019-12-18T16:54:42  <Bosmon> The only way I could see it could work if the entirety of UIO were destroyed and then recreated by the localisation
2019-12-18T16:54:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you happen to have a chance to see my reply to you about the uio+ tasks? I was wondering if we should tackle some localization work or not. although regardless I think you're right in that we need to fix things in the prefs framework
2019-12-18T16:55:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think there's been a bunch of clever rerendering in the SJRK work.. which is to say lots of hoops to jump through and workarounds for things lacking in the prefs framework itself
2019-12-18T16:57:28  <Bosmon> I see that the "demo" does reach in and directly fire the PrefsEditorLoader "onReady" event

2019-12-18T17:00:05  <Bosmon> In any case, with the post FLUID-6148 framework we should be able to do a lot better, including not having to reset the sliding panel state

2019-12-18T17:02:49  <Bosmon> Probably the most direct approach is to create a kind of "dynamic path" cut-through that resolves the root message bundle dynamically and early, and then rewire all the references to bind into that, so that even if the current rendering model makes the components look as if they have to wait for the I/O to finish, they can bind to another component that doesn't
2019-12-18T17:03:22  <Bosmon> This involves the least upheaval, I think, and lets us keep our existing clunky "strings" model that the old renderer relies on

2019-12-18T17:21:16  <gmoss> Bosmon: It was indeed working pre-6148, with the reach-in-and-make-things-happen-manually system :) it was never ideal, and the set of Jiras from FLUID-6299 to 6312 or so were meant to address the matter. So for the time being, perhaps we'll leave out the ability to switch languages on the fly. the UI is still localized just fine on a global at page load, and that will have to be good enough until the framework is
2019-12-18T17:21:16  <gmoss> ready for me to use it the way I'd prefer :)

2019-12-18T19:52:58  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3936, the jira says "have some kind of table here which can then be directed in order to determine which credential to supply". i understand this table will create a mapping between the key-in method and the type of client credential to be used. key in methods like "usb" and "pcsc" will map to "public client credential" while "auto key-in" will map to "private(nova) client credent
2019-12-18T19:52:58  <cindyli> ial".
2019-12-18T19:54:17  <cindyli> however, right now in the code, there's already an option "environmental" to distinguish windows auto key in and non-auto key in - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/listeners.js#L114-L115
2019-12-18T19:55:03  <cindyli> it's set to false for usb and pcsc key in methods and set to true for windows auto key in
2019-12-18T19:56:14  <cindyli> it's used to re-login the last windows key. details can be found in https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3988
2019-12-18T19:58:20  <cindyli> do you think if it makes sense to re-use this "environmental" for GPII-3939, or i should still create a separate table so that it doesn't create dependency between solutions for these 2 issues?
2019-12-18T20:01:47  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.102> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-12-18T20:06:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think it was already noted in the JIRA that there is a clear commonality between these two use cases
2019-12-18T20:07:11  <Bosmon> But yes, i) there should be one table, ii) you shouldn't simply "reuse" the same one named "environmental" because the name is inappropriate
2019-12-18T20:07:30  <Bosmon> The value of the "environmental" flag just becomes an element in the lookup table, alongside the credential type

2019-12-18T20:14:06  <cindyli> it's set to false for usb and pcsc key in methods and set to true for windows auto key in

2019-12-18T20:16:28  <cindyli> it makes sense for the replay of last windows key in
2019-12-18T20:16:36  <cindyli> but does't make sense to use in a lookup table
2019-12-18T20:18:01  <cindyli> i could either: replace the "environmental" flag in boolean to "keyInMethod" in string
2019-12-18T20:19:18  <cindyli> or: keep the "environmental" flag in boolean and check it to decide which client credential type should be used.
2019-12-18T20:19:41  <cindyli> the latter is against what u said about "you shouldn't simply "reuse" the same one named "environmental" because the name is inappropriate"
2019-12-18T20:19:57  <cindyli> so, shall i implement the former?

2019-12-18T20:31:03  <cindyli> for now, i will take the easy route to use a function like:
2019-12-18T20:31:09  <cindyli> function getClientCredentialDataSource (environmental) {
2019-12-18T20:31:09  <cindyli>     return environmental ? "privateClientCredentialDataSource" : "publicClientCredentialDataSource";

2019-12-18T20:52:44  <Bosmon> cindyli - no
2019-12-18T20:52:52  <Bosmon> The contents of the lookup table should be intelligible
2019-12-18T20:53:16  <Bosmon> e.g. usb: {environmental: false, credential: "local"} etc.
2019-12-18T20:54:11  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you mean the key in type "usb" should be passed in from the user listeners too?
2019-12-18T20:54:33  <cindyli> i started with it then found "environmental" has already been passed in from user listeners
2019-12-18T20:54:48  <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess it makes more sense for the lookup for each listener to be stored in the listener itself
2019-12-18T20:55:07  <cindyli> oh, ok
2019-12-18T20:55:09  <Bosmon> Although the author of the listener may not be able to anticipate all possible lookup values
2019-12-18T20:55:14  <Bosmon> Still, it's a start : P
2019-12-18T20:55:25  <Bosmon> If they have grades, we can always contribute stuff in later
2019-12-18T20:55:41  <Bosmon> I can't remember if they do or not
2019-12-18T20:55:49  <Bosmon> Or how they get instantiated, or if they even do...
2019-12-18T20:55:59  <Bosmon> Infusion was pretty unambitious in the days when these things were designed
2019-12-18T20:56:17  <cindyli> ya, each listener type has its own grade
2019-12-18T20:56:57  <cindyli> i think i know what you mean. thanks, Bosmon
2019-12-18T20:57:04  <Bosmon> Not giving settingsHandlers grades was one of our biggest blunders
2019-12-18T20:57:27  <Bosmon> But I had no confidence in Infusion's component model in 2012
2019-12-18T20:58:14  <cindyli> Bosmon: it should be ok to use member options for {environmental: false, credential: "local"}?
2019-12-18T20:58:27  <Bosmon> cindyli - I don't see why they can't be ordinary options
2019-12-18T20:58:37  <Bosmon> There's absolutely no possibility the value could change during the lifetime of the component
2019-12-18T20:59:06  <cindyli> yes, but should they be available for integrators to override these values?
2019-12-18T20:59:16  <Bosmon> cindyli - well they always are, via options distributions
2019-12-18T20:59:44  <cindyli> ok. will use regular options
2019-12-18T20:59:48  <Bosmon> This is why I asked whether listeners are actually components or not : P
2019-12-18T20:59:58  <cindyli> they are
2019-12-18T21:00:01  <Bosmon> good
