2019-12-03T14:34:12  <the-t-in-rtf1> Since we're changing various cloud endpoints, I wanted to focus on things that actually use the cloud endpoints.

2019-12-03T14:34:38  <the-t-in-rtf1> I have tried both with a checkout of gpii-app and with the standalone installer, I haven't found any combination of QSS strip buttons that results in a cloud read/write.

2019-12-03T14:35:19  <the-t-in-rtf1> In fact I have completely disabled networking on the test VMs, and the behaviour of the buttons doesn't change at all.
2019-12-03T14:35:52  <the-t-in-rtf1> So, my question once again is, is there anything an end user can do through Morphic that results in read/writing from the cloud.

2019-12-03T14:43:22  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf1: Javi is certainly the better person to answer this question. here's what i know about but it may not be comprehensive:
2019-12-03T14:43:36  <cindyli> 1. specify the env var GPII_CLOUD_URL
2019-12-03T14:43:54  <cindyli> with windows powershell, the command looks like:
2019-12-03T14:43:59  <cindyli> $env:GPII_CLOUD_URL="http://flowmanager.dev-jhernandez.gpii.net/"
2019-12-03T14:44:09  <the-t-in-rtf> right, but by default it should point to prod?
2019-12-03T14:44:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, unless it's configured to point to localhost by default it's not doing anything.
2019-12-03T14:44:38  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I completely disabled networking and nothing in the QSS ever complained
2019-12-03T14:45:07  <the-t-in-rtf> Are our production and other tests the only way we have of exercising the cloud?
2019-12-03T14:45:24  <the-t-in-rtf> or is there anything in the QSS that will result at least in a GET from the cloud?
2019-12-03T14:45:39  <cindyli> it seems your Morphic is using the local CouchDB
2019-12-03T14:45:52  <the-t-in-rtf> I used the installer in a clean VM!
2019-12-03T14:46:04  <cindyli> i'm not sure where GPII_CLOUD_URL is defined in the installer. i don't find it in the gpii-app repo
2019-12-03T14:46:13  <the-t-in-rtf> so if there is something the installer set it up.
2019-12-03T14:46:29  <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, I tracked that down a while back on my own, it's deep in universal
2019-12-03T14:46:35  <the-t-in-rtf> the environment I mean
2019-12-03T14:46:37  <cindyli> 2. you need to use app.production config file
2019-12-03T14:47:43  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: the universal consumes GPII_CLOUD_URL but the url should not be defined there
2019-12-03T14:47:46  <the-t-in-rtf> with the installer?
2019-12-03T14:48:14  <the-t-in-rtf> so the installer installs couchdb and our data locally?
2019-12-03T14:48:51  <cindyli> at least the installer I used before does install couchdb locally so you can switch in between dev and prod
2019-12-03T14:49:14  <cindyli> but i'm not sure if there are different installers
2019-12-03T14:49:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I used the one gpii-app downloads
2019-12-03T14:49:38  <the-t-in-rtf> and I don't see CouchDB running
2019-12-03T14:49:55  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, or maybe it did.
2019-12-03T14:50:35  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: is there a file named "service.json5" in gpii-app/provisioning directory?
2019-12-03T14:51:14  <the-t-in-rtf> not in the repo, no
2019-12-03T14:52:22  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: ya, repo doesn't have this file. did you install via Morphic installer?
2019-12-03T14:52:41  <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2019-12-03T14:54:19  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: is there a service.json5 file anywhere in gpii-app/ dir
2019-12-03T14:55:04  <the-t-in-rtf> I would have to find where the installer creates that
2019-12-03T14:55:14  <the-t-in-rtf> or do you mean in the repo I copied the installer from?
2019-12-03T14:55:47  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway the repo doesn't have one
2019-12-03T14:55:58  <cindyli> actually, there was one before in the repo
2019-12-03T14:56:04  <the-t-in-rtf> cool?
2019-12-03T14:56:11  <the-t-in-rtf> there isn't one in master now.
2019-12-03T14:56:20  <cindyli> but no longer in there :(
2019-12-03T14:57:40  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, this is seeming like a big agenda item for tomorrow.
2019-12-03T14:58:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I have a lot of data points that suggest that the QSS doesn't use the cloud at all, which I suspect is not going to surprise a few people who aren't around, but is news to some of us.
2019-12-03T15:00:03  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. probably Javi and Bosmon won't be surprised by this
2019-12-03T15:05:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I wasn't able to find a service.json5 file at all on the machine where I installed Morphic using the installer, BTW

I wrote this test case: https://pastebin.com/FrpqU5yd. It currently works by specifying "priority" at line 36. however, if I commented line 10, 36 and expected the overriding happens by the namespace, the test would fail by returning "override first", rather than
2019-12-03T19:04:59  <cindyli> {
2019-12-03T19:04:59  <cindyli>   "step1": "override first",
2019-12-03T19:04:59  <cindyli>   "step2": "second"
2019-12-03T19:04:59  <cindyli> }
2019-12-03T19:05:15  <cindyli> is this expected behaviour?
