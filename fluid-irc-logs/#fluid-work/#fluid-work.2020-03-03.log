2020-03-03T19:29:06  <Justin_o> a4aditya20: have you read over the project descriptions and the getting started wiki pages?
2020-03-03T19:33:53  <a4aditya20> Justin_o Yes, I have and had gone through the Repositories as well. I really like the idea for migrating the floe and the fluid project to Hugo static site generator and had some doubt about the same
