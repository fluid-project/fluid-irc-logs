2019-01-02T19:51:04  <cherylhjli> hey folks, do we have a keynote license? if not, what do we typically use to build decks?

2019-01-02T21:28:35  <colinclark> cherylhjli: Hey, sorry, I just saw your question from earlier. You can ask Bert if we have any Keynote licenses floating aroundâ€”they used to come free with new Macs, but I don't know if that's still the case. I used to be a big Keynote user but switched back to PowerPoint after I had some compatibility issues. The font rendering and layout in PPT is so much worse, but oh well :)

2019-01-02T23:00:05  <gmoss> colinclark Bosmon: I have made a fresh PR for the storytelling tool which would pull in our latest "working master" into the fluid-project fork's master branch proper: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/3
2019-01-02T23:00:18  <colinclark> Thanks, gmoss
2019-01-02T23:00:45  <colinclark> It's nice to have that JIRA board to refer to with our outstanding issues
2019-01-02T23:01:11  <gmoss> colinclark: for sure! there are also those smaller boards we made to cover the 'spikes' I've been working on lately
