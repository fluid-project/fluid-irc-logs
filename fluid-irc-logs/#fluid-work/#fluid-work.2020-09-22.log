2020-09-22T16:43:10  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip, Teddy___, regarding the new github repo i will create, shall i create one for the entire map work or just for the diffing tool? i lean towards the former. what do you think?
2020-09-22T16:43:57  <Bosmon> cindyli - this is just a temporary-ish repo to house data relating to the assessment centres
2020-09-22T16:44:10  <Bosmon> The diffing tool is some ways off from having anything that is worth building a repo for : P
2020-09-22T16:45:44  <philip> Bosmon, cindyli: So should it be named e.g. covid-assessment-centres?
2020-09-22T16:49:10  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip: ok, a data repo. or ontario-covid-assessment-centres? probably covid-assessment-centres is better in case someday it's extended out of Ontrario ;)
2020-09-22T16:49:31  <philip> cindyli: Sounds good
2020-09-22T16:50:40  <Teddy___> cindyli: agreed
2020-09-22T16:51:31  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip, Teddy___: here's the repo - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres
2020-09-22T16:51:58  <Teddy___> cindyli: Thanks!
2020-09-22T16:54:14  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip, Teddy___: i'm thinking to create a "versions" directory to hold dataset versions. will commit the first version and the live version. philip, once that is ready, could you create a pull request to commit the version you have?
2020-09-22T16:55:20  <philip> cindyli: yep
2020-09-22T17:04:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you have time could you please review https://github.com/fluid-project/eslint-config-fluid/pull/8 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1008
2020-09-22T17:10:03  <cindyli> philip: what's your github repo? i need your id to grant access to the new repo
2020-09-22T17:13:37  <philip> cindyli: my github id is ptcher
2020-09-22T17:13:52  <cindyli> philip: great. thanks. i'm done with pushing up 2 versions I have - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres
2020-09-22T17:16:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, will do
2020-09-22T17:17:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)

2020-09-22T17:57:57  <cindyli> colinclark: thanks for bringing up the license question - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/commit/cf46f769d3981f8c742a8593efdb922b82a68576#commitcomment-42633068. looking at the description of OGL-O license and CC license, they are all pretty open and suits our needs. how do we usually decide which license should be used?
2020-09-22T18:02:30  <colinclark> just in a call, but i’ll respond soon
2020-09-22T18:42:10  *** clown_afk is now known as clown
2020-09-22T18:54:44  <colinclark> cindyli: ok, i have a couple minutes, sorry for the delay
2020-09-22T18:54:51  <colinclark> philip too if you’re around
2020-09-22T18:55:17  <colinclark> the OGL-O is quite nice
2020-09-22T18:55:47  <colinclark> the key issue I look at with licenses is like this is not only if we have the right to use the data, but if we can freely combine it with other sources of data and our own
2020-09-22T18:56:01  <colinclark> and secondly, if there are any restrictions on “re-licensing”
2020-09-22T18:56:21  <colinclark> i.e. to take the derived work that we created, and distribute it under a different license
2020-09-22T18:56:38  <colinclark> it looks like there are no such restrictions, which is great
2020-09-22T18:56:50  <colinclark> I also often ask myself, “why does this license exist?” :)
2020-09-22T18:57:13  <colinclark> when it’s a license that isn’t super familiar (e.g. Creative Commons, BSD, MIT, GPL, etc.)
2020-09-22T18:58:15  <colinclark> It’s clear that this license exists because lawyers from the Province wanted to make sure that use of the data wasn’t in anyway confused as an endorsement or as being by the government themselves
2020-09-22T18:58:21  <colinclark> this is often the reason for unique licenses
2020-09-22T18:59:00  <colinclark> Typically we use CC-BY 4.0 International for our “content” licenses (i.e. non-code)
2020-09-22T18:59:15  <colinclark> the OGL-O license clearly places no restrictions on our ability to do this
2020-09-22T19:00:30  <colinclark> In an ideal case, what philip is recommending is always nice… to keep the original data in a separate directory with the appropriate license placed alongside it, either in a LICENSE file or just in the README
2020-09-22T19:00:50  <colinclark> but if it’s impractical, that’s okay—I don’t see any legal reason why any kind of distinction or alignment needs to be preserved
2020-09-22T19:01:12  <colinclark> there may, however, be other reasons (and I suspect there are)
2020-09-22T19:01:38  <philip> colinclark: what would it mean for the same file to be under multiple licenses though?
2020-09-22T19:01:57  <colinclark> I think the simplest approach is to license our repo as CC-BY-4 and include the acknowledgement of the OGL-O data in the README, and bonus points if we can keep it physically distinct in the repo but no big deal
2020-09-22T19:02:25  <colinclark> It wouldn’t be :)
2020-09-22T19:03:05  <colinclark> the data, as distributed by us, would be licensed under CC-BY
2020-09-22T19:03:15  <colinclark> with an acknowledgement of the source of the ODS data
2020-09-22T19:03:56  <philip> colinclark: Right, that sounds good
2020-09-22T19:04:37  <colinclark> just to confirm, philip, do you imagine that “their data” and “our data” will end up in the same CSV file in the repository at some point?
2020-09-22T19:04:46  <colinclark> or is this physical separation possible
2020-09-22T19:05:10  <colinclark> e.g. like how we have jQuery in the Infusion repository, but it’s in its own directory and file, with appropriate licensing information contained in there
2020-09-22T19:06:09  <philip> colinclark: Well, I wonder how separate we can make them, and what the usability cost would be
2020-09-22T19:07:31  <cindyli> colinclark, philip: we could keep ODS data files in a separate folder. (i'm thinking to rename "versions" folder to "ODS"). our merged core file could output to a separate folder like "core" or just use the root folder
2020-09-22T19:08:04  <cindyli> philip: what do you think?
2020-09-22T19:08:30  <colinclark> they don’t need to be separate
2020-09-22T19:08:33  <colinclark> we’ll be fine
2020-09-22T19:08:36  <colinclark> it’s like a kind of ideal
2020-09-22T19:09:23  <philip> colinclark, cindyli: right, but there has to be some overlap to be able to reconnect them. So when is our data a version of the ODS data versus a separate thing?
2020-09-22T19:10:02  <cindyli> colinclark: "they don’t need to be separate". do you mean data files don't need to be in separate folders or it doesn't matter the file content is a mix of ODS data + our data?
2020-09-22T19:12:53  <colinclark> the latter
2020-09-22T19:13:00  <colinclark> in an ideal state, you’d have them separate
2020-09-22T19:13:12  <colinclark> and i can imagine our data infrastructure may some day support this kind of separatin
2020-09-22T19:13:23  <colinclark> but prior to that, if it all has to get mixed together, that’s fiine
2020-09-22T19:13:36  <colinclark> and the license we have from ODS is appropriate for that
2020-09-22T19:14:14  <cindyli> great
2020-09-22T19:16:58  <philip> cindyli, colinclark: agreed
2020-09-22T19:17:35  <cindyli> philip: i will create a pull request to add a LICENSE.txt with cc-by-4
2020-09-22T19:17:43  <cindyli> colinclark: thanks so much
2020-09-22T19:18:00  <colinclark> i hope it was helpful
2020-09-22T19:18:13  <colinclark> the only reason i’m suggesting cc-by is because it’s one we already use a lot
2020-09-22T19:18:19  <colinclark> it’s very permissive
2020-09-22T19:20:01  <cindyli> it IS very helpful. thanks
