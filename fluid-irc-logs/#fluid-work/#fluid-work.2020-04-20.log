2020-04-20T12:04:02  <Bosmon> Hi there stegru - I was wondering about JJ's C++ rewrite of the system settings handler - https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/311/files
2020-04-20T12:04:12  <Bosmon> Do you remember why this was necessary - is it really impossible to do this in C#?

2020-04-20T12:04:48  <Bosmon> It seems a bit of a liability, assuming that the Morphic Lite people might ever want to bind to this handler
2020-04-20T12:05:00  <Bosmon> As well as having introduced this instability ....

2020-04-20T13:47:32  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @jhernandez, your theory led me to try disabling everything but the resolution setting in the os_win acceptance tests.
2020-04-20T13:47:38  <the-t-in-rtf> That passes
2020-04-20T13:47:45  <the-t-in-rtf> as does just resolution and screen dpi
2020-04-20T13:47:57  <the-t-in-rtf> so my theory is that we have a rotten apple somewhere in the barrel
2020-04-20T13:48:04  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm going to use the rule of halves until I find the culprit

2020-04-20T17:34:25  <the-t-in-rtf> If you bet on screen mirroring breaking things, pat yourself on the back and then wash your hands for 30 seconds.
2020-04-20T17:34:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I will look for an explanation on the morrow.
2020-04-20T17:35:40  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, @Bosmon, anyone with context, how vital to our mission is the screen mirroring stuff?
2020-04-20T17:36:08  <the-t-in-rtf> If I can't fix it, I may end up luring it into the basement with the promise of some fine sherry and walling it up.

2020-04-20T20:47:41  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: I've configured Github Actions CI builds on the Infusion repository. Your new PRs (and updates to the old PRs) will trigger a CI build in both Jenkins and GitHub Actions for now. Please let me know if you notice any issues, the process should be seamless.
2020-04-20T20:48:47  <gtirloni> for now please consider this is an experiment, just like we had with Buildkite in the past. We'll see if it works as we expect or not
