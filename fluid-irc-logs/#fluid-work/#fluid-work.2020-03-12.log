2020-03-12T06:23:10  <sachin10101998> Justin_o I updated the PR https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/41 as per the fix you suggested using the partials plugin. It's working perfectly . Please review
2020-03-12T06:24:28  <sachin10101998> We were already using the plugin version 2.9.2. So , I didn't have to add it separately.

2020-03-12T17:35:32  <gmoss> hi Nakul! when you're back online you should try contacting the-t-in-rtf who is the mentor for that project. We tend to work North American business hours, though the-t-in-rtf will be online during Central European hours. If you have difficulty reaching us, try the fluid-work mailing list.
2020-03-12T17:35:32  <gmoss> ayush23dash: my IRC client is permanently connected, so I might be in the channel but not actually around. I'm most reliably reached between 11:00 and 18:00 EDT (UTC-4)

2020-03-12T17:47:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so I've mentioned this in a few spots, but wondering if you have any ideas. In looking at GPII-4218. So we have a datasource in Infusion which handles outbound requests (read/write) but we don't seem to have the opposite, something that handles inbound requests. In general it probably wasn't needed, but with the messaging systems like websockets it seems useful. Any thoughts?
2020-03-12T17:49:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: part of the issue I had when looking at refactoring the portbinding to something more generalizable is that the function to transmit the message is different and the parameters it takes too.
2020-03-12T17:49:00  <Justin_o> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/src/lib/portBinding.js#L218-L235
2020-03-12T17:49:23  <Justin_o> so in the ports we can send Objects, for the web socket we'll need to serialize it first

2020-03-12T18:14:48  <amankumar> Justin_o ,sir ca you please tell me where you are referring to make the changes https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/169
2020-03-12T18:17:57  <Justin_o> amankumar: the `for`attribute in the `label` needs to point at the `id` of the `input` it is labelling. You may need to do some more research into setting labels for inputs in HTML.
2020-03-12T18:18:27  <amankumar> okay Justin_o

2020-03-12T18:25:37  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in general we need to reorganise DataSource a bit so it is better at being asymmetric
2020-03-12T18:25:41  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf has noted this a few times
2020-03-12T18:27:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: is that something I should look at with this work, or should I just look for other ways

2020-03-12T19:13:38  <Bosmon> Well, fixing that would be a big task
2020-03-12T19:13:52  <Bosmon> I'm not quite sure of the best way to factor it
2020-03-12T19:14:37  <Bosmon> I guess we would have to make new grades with funny names, such as ReadDataSource and WriteDataSource
2020-03-12T19:14:53  <Bosmon> And then plain "DataSource" would become an alias for something like SymmetricDataSource

2020-03-12T19:17:38  <chaitanya> @aashimgarg   like Hugo, Jekyll, etc. i guess we can choose.
2020-03-12T19:24:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm getting a bit confused about the symmetry part. What I'm seeing as one asymmetry is that the datasource only handles outgoing messages and not incoming ones
2020-03-12T19:25:11  <Justin_o> and the further confusing part is that reading and writing can happen in either direction
2020-03-12T19:26:14  <Justin_o> but I'm also thinking now for my current situation if I really have to care about all this, and can just use the simple web socket and use exclude source to not have the model changes triggered by a socket request, sent back across the socket
2020-03-12T19:28:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: although I'm not sure if we'll have potential issues on a UIO+ change happening at the same time as key in/out and on the initial connection. If there is both a local change to UIO+ and a change from the prefs set who wins?
2020-03-12T19:28:42  <Justin_o> who should win?
2020-03-12T19:30:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, it's hard to say, although we could reduce the risk of races by the "rebasing" trick that we are already doing in a few places
2020-03-12T19:31:19  <Bosmon> The risk of a collision is very low
2020-03-12T19:31:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean like the remoteModel component?
2020-03-12T19:31:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2020-03-12T19:31:35  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you mean the risk is low without the rebasing?
2020-03-12T19:32:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think the biggest likely hood is what happens on load. Currently the web socket is setup to get an initial model from morphic and applies that to UIO+. So in this case any local changes will get wiped out.
