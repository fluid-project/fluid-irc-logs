2019-06-24T12:07:10  <jhernandez> stegru: hey there
2019-06-24T12:07:13  <jhernandez> you around?
2019-06-24T12:07:18  <stegru> yes
2019-06-24T12:07:38  <jhernandez> I was taking a look at this one: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3978
2019-06-24T12:08:00  <jhernandez> and in code, we ignore new usb keys whenever they arrive
2019-06-24T12:08:39  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/usb.js#L77
2019-06-24T12:09:00  <jhernandez> do you remember if we discussed the expected behavior?
2019-06-24T12:09:23  <jhernandez> maybe Bosmon knows?
2019-06-24T12:09:56  <stegru> I can't remember what the expected behaviour was
2019-06-24T12:10:11  <jhernandez> well, in code is very well documented
2019-06-24T12:10:14  <jhernandez> :P
2019-06-24T12:10:22  <jhernandez> that's why I was asking
2019-06-24T12:10:33  <stegru> yes, there must have been a reason why I coded it that way
2019-06-24T12:10:42  <stegru> i mean, it's not accidental
2019-06-24T12:10:45  <jhernandez> exactly
2019-06-24T12:11:09  <jhernandez> let's see if Bosmon's memory is better than ours :P
2019-06-24T12:11:16  <stegru> it usually is
2019-06-24T12:11:57  <stegru> ok, imagine I'm keyed in.. then you give me a usb drive with some pictures of your dog, but it contains your gpii key
2019-06-24T12:12:10  <stegru> should it key you in?
2019-06-24T12:12:13  <jhernandez> yes
2019-06-24T12:12:32  <stegru> but that would make my computer turn spanish
2019-06-24T12:12:36  <jhernandez> but I guess that it should be the user who decides that
2019-06-24T12:13:06  <jhernandez> (for which we don't have such user intervention)
2019-06-24T12:13:39  <jhernandez> dunno
2019-06-24T12:13:48  <jhernandez> maybe a problem for UX
2019-06-24T12:13:56  <stegru> yeh
2019-06-24T12:14:13  <jhernandez> then we can do whatever they think is the expected behavior
2019-06-24T12:14:16  <jhernandez> ok
2019-06-24T12:14:24  <jhernandez> I'll reassign that one to Bern
2019-06-24T12:14:34  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-06-24T12:14:38  <jhernandez> :*
2019-06-24T12:14:47  <stegru> but you're right - the code is very explicit, so there must have been a decision made somewhere

2019-06-24T12:22:26  <stegru> now we just need to hack jira so it looks like bern wrote it
2019-06-24T12:23:45  <jhernandez> hahaha
2019-06-24T12:29:30  <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - looks like we are facing global failures in all CI due to chocolatey being up the fritz
2019-06-24T12:30:07  <stegru> https://status.chocolatey.org/
2019-06-24T12:30:27  <Bosmon> stegru - yeah, they are liars
2019-06-24T12:30:34  <Bosmon> Oh wow
2019-06-24T12:30:37  <Bosmon> There is an announcement now
2019-06-24T12:30:43  <stegru> that wasn't there before
2019-06-24T12:31:07  <Bosmon> But I didn't know that our CI ran from AWS ....
2019-06-24T12:31:34  <Bosmon> jhernandez - this is why it's so important to write JIRA references in code comments explaining unusual behaviour : P
2019-06-24T12:32:18  <Bosmon> jhernandez - but notice that Bern's comment from 2 years ago states that our implemented behaviour is incorrect
2019-06-24T12:32:34  <Bosmon> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2682?focusedCommentId=29918&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-29918

2019-06-24T17:59:13  <jhernandez> stegru, Bosmon: I took a quick look at the usb behavior
2019-06-24T18:00:03  <jhernandez> what should happen if the 2nd inserted key has the same key? let's say userA
2019-06-24T18:00:37  <stegru> I'd expect nothing to happen
2019-06-24T18:00:44  <jhernandez> is the flowmanager handling this situation? if not - shall we ask UX?
2019-06-24T18:00:54  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, me too
2019-06-24T18:01:41  <jhernandez> not sure if the flowmanager is already ignoring it or whether we should ignore it from the user listener side

2019-06-24T18:05:06  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/9bd021f95b3fe64a6a9d1fdcd18b8e8044007187/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L354-L354
2019-06-24T18:09:22  <jhernandez> ok, then if the 2nd usb has the same token it'll key-out and key it back in
2019-06-24T18:10:16  <stegru> currently it will do nothing with a 2nd key - but if you removed that check, then yes.
2019-06-24T18:11:05  <jhernandez> oh yes, exactly, taking into account that I removed that check
2019-06-24T18:11:38  <jhernandez> okay, then I'll add a check to not trigger the user key-in if it's the same

2019-06-24T22:44:52  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Do you have any pending updates or dev releases of gpii-express-user? I just realized my tests were failing because it was using the copies of `infusion` and `gpii-json-schema` from it... although I'm not sure why `infusion` didn't get dudped. Either way, I can take a quick look at bumping the versions in it for a dev release, unless you're already working on that
