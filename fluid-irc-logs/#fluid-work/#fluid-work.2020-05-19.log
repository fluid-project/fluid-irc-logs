2020-05-19T11:40:55  <the-t-in-rtf> My theory is still that either something important isn't being copied into the instrumented subdir or that there's some basic problem with running instrumented code at all

2020-05-19T17:27:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: I have a quick infusion question I'm hoping you may be able to help with. for model relays and model listeners, is there any sort of batching and/or debouncing that happens, or should I expect a given model listener to fire on every single change to the specified path, regardless of interval?
2020-05-19T17:28:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: I believe the latter, although I'm not completely sure if that's the case with code changes in FLUID-6148/FLUID-6145 branches.. are you running into an issue where you are losing changes or you want debounce?
2020-05-19T17:28:34  *** kasparnet <kasparnet!~kasper2@193.89.98.158> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2020-05-19T17:29:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: nope, just planning some work, considering whether I will want to implement some debouncing myself if it isn't already present
2020-05-19T17:30:11  <gmoss> TL;DR is that we have a timestamp for last modified on a story, weighing the potential overhead on the client side of updating the timestamp on every keystroke, for instance
2020-05-19T17:31:27  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you use the remote model component it does debouncing
2020-05-19T17:31:53  <gmoss> Justin_o: this is a field on the component's model proper, would that be an appropriate use case?
2020-05-19T17:32:04  <Justin_o> well sort of, it just waits for an operation to complete before starting another one and will merge any pending operations
2020-05-19T17:32:18  <Justin_o> gmoss: hmm.. not sure
2020-05-19T17:32:28  <sachin10101998> greatislander gmoss in the solution you suggested for FLUID-6454, what text do we need the screen reader to read?
2020-05-19T17:32:45  <sachin10101998> <a href="#"><span class="aria-hidden">< </span>Previous <span class="screen-reader-text">Page </span></a>
2020-05-19T17:32:47  <Justin_o> gmoss: I guess that's related to the autosaving
2020-05-19T17:32:57  <gmoss> sachin10101998: that's a good question, I think I will leave that to someone more familiar with that component. Justin_o?
2020-05-19T17:33:02  <gmoss> Justin_o: yep, related to autosaving
2020-05-19T17:33:04  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'm leaving a comment on the JIRA ticket right now too
2020-05-19T17:33:26  <Justin_o> gmoss: where does it save to?
2020-05-19T17:33:43  <sachin10101998> You suggested this ^ but this will only read page. and theres no such class as screen-reader-text in infusion I guess. Creating a new class shouldn't be riht for this small issue I guess.
2020-05-19T17:33:50  <sachin10101998> Justin_o: Ohh alright
2020-05-19T17:34:29  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.120.220.187> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-05-19T17:35:50  <gmoss> Justin_o: this particular field is stored in the story component's model, which is saved to the browser's localStorage along with all text content, block's files are saving to the server (once SJRK-289 is done). this timestamp is going to be used for things like determining stale stories, so it doesn't need to be 100% to the millisecond
2020-05-19T17:36:31  <gmoss> The value as we plan it to be used is only going to be referenced on the server side, afaik
2020-05-19T17:36:37  <gmoss> so maybe remoteModel does make sense here..
2020-05-19T17:38:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, from your explanation I think so
2020-05-19T17:39:44  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, I'll keep that in mind for the work, when the time comes :) thanks!
2020-05-19T17:40:33  <colinclark> or just update the timestamp on a slow timer, gmoss
2020-05-19T17:40:37  <colinclark> rather than on every keystroke
2020-05-19T17:41:55  <gmoss> colinclark: yeah the solution may end up being that. I was hoping not to have to roll my own, but it seems that may end up being the case
2020-05-19T17:42:10  <colinclark> Why would you have to roll your own?
2020-05-19T17:43:08  <colinclark> Debouncing is a very different thing than simply keeping track of time slowly :)
2020-05-19T17:43:08  <gmoss> if there isn't currently any debouncing or timer built into the way model listeners operate, then I'd be adding some code to handle that
2020-05-19T17:44:44  <gmoss> colinclark: I think I don't understand what you mean by a slow timer, in that case
2020-05-19T17:45:11  <colinclark> indeed

2020-05-19T18:49:35  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: as this is only a change in demo, you'll have to do manual testing. If you were changing code you could also run through the unit tests (e.g. running "npm run test:vagrant")

2020-05-19T18:53:35  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: it's probably worth while to get at least a basic understanding of how the screen reader works.
2020-05-19T18:53:51  <sachin10101998> Hmm, reading about it.
2020-05-19T18:54:17  <Justin_o> there are also some automated tools you can use to test the accessible markup. Although they won't necessarily catch all the potential issues.
2020-05-19T18:55:12  <sachin10101998> Can you refer some blog post or articles where i can get a good understanding of how screen readers work?

2020-05-19T18:58:48  <Justin_o> these look like the docs, but I'm not sure how easy it will be to understand them https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/
2020-05-19T18:59:59  <Justin_o> clown: do you know if there is good, easy to understand, guide for using Orca?
2020-05-19T19:04:02  <clown> Justin_o:  there used to be, but it's been years.
2020-05-19T19:04:26  <clown> Let me look around at where I thought it was and see if anything is still there anymore/
2020-05-19T19:04:36  <sachin10101998> Thanks clown
2020-05-19T19:04:39  <Justin_o> clown: thanks
2020-05-19T19:06:27  <clown> This looks recent.  The last update is listed as Aug 2019:  https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca

2020-05-19T19:11:25  <sachin10101998> I wonder how do people who can't read without screen readers but hasn't used them before start using it. There's lots of information here specifying how to use it. Do they need someone else to explain it to them or is there some existing workaround for it?
2020-05-19T19:18:26  <gmoss> colinclark Justin_o: following up on my question about debouncing, etc. I looked into how gpii.binder is implemented and wrote a quick proof-of-concept. It won't be necessary to add any special coding for a model listener to update timestampLastModified, since gpii.binder uses jQuery.change() to bind DOM to model changes, which for `input` and `textarea` elements only fires once focus is lost, not on every keystroke
2020-05-19T19:20:37  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I'm not completely sure of the exact process, but I'd assume that there is some process where they initially work with someone else to learn how to use a tool. However, someone might migrate from one screen reader to another on their own. It also probably depends on when they have lost their vision, their prior knowledge and etc.
2020-05-19T19:21:19  <sachin10101998> Got it. thanks Justin_o
2020-05-19T19:22:20  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you reload the page, does it trigger that event before the page unloads?
2020-05-19T19:22:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: Let me test that...
2020-05-19T19:23:03  <gmoss> Justin_o: no it does not
2020-05-19T19:23:28  <gmoss> i.e. I changed the contents of the textarea, closed the tab and reloaded the page, and that last change was not saved
2020-05-19T19:24:15  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, I guess you could also bind to the pages unload event to trigger another save if that's something you want to capture as well, but I guess it depends on what the tool needs
2020-05-19T19:25:14  <gmoss> Justin_o: since the idea behind this feature is to retain the author's work in case of accidents or to allow them to come back to their work, I think your idea would be good to implement
2020-05-19T19:27:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: I guess that wouldn't catch cases where the browser crashes, computer crashes ( or power outage), and not sure if you just close the browser completely... but I'm not sure how we could capture all those without saving with higher frequency.
2020-05-19T19:27:49  <gmoss> Justin_o: indeed, or saving in a way that exists alongside or instead of the gpii.binder
2020-05-19T19:28:00  <Justin_o> right
2020-05-19T19:28:42  <gmoss> that seems like a whole other can of worms
2020-05-19T19:28:45  <gmoss> I'll give this some thought
2020-05-19T19:28:50  <gmoss> thanks for your help so far, either way :)

2020-05-19T20:02:20  <Teddy___> Hey everyone! While working on this PR: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/230 I have been merging the dev changes in so that branch can be up to date and ready to merge when done. I now want squash those merges so the commit history looks cleaner but when I enter `git rebase -i HEAD~28` those merge commits do not show up. Instead the the commits from the original commiter appear.
2020-05-19T20:02:20  <Teddy___> Any advice?

2020-05-19T21:39:38  <greatislander> gtirloni, I'm seeing a connectivity issue with my ownCloud desktop application — it is saying that files.inclusivedesign.ca is in maintenance mode. Are you working on something at the moment?
2020-05-19T21:40:08  <gtirloni> greatislander: yes, I was. it's out of maintenance mode. could you try closing/opening it again?
2020-05-19T21:40:17  <greatislander> Sure, will do
2020-05-19T21:41:26  <greatislander> that did it, thanks!
2020-05-19T21:42:28  <gtirloni> awesome, I've converted us from ownCloud to nextCloud v12 as a first step. I'll have to work on upgrading it all the way to v18 tomorrow and then move everything to a new server. I'll warn everybody in advance (I didn't today because it was supposed to be a fast process, you got lucky!)
2020-05-19T21:49:46  <gtirloni> just emailed everyone with details
2020-05-19T21:52:45  <greatislander> hahah
