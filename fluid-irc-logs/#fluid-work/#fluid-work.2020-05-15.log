2020-05-15T13:56:51  <jhernandez> sgithens, Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: hey there
2020-05-15T13:57:37  <jhernandez> how do you feel about building an installer today? - even by knowing that we'll miss lots of tech debt
2020-05-15T13:58:26  <jhernandez> my cluster is up & running and I was pulling the last dep update that Bosmon sent to gpii-app
2020-05-15T13:58:40  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, my question was, what's in the update
2020-05-15T13:59:09  <the-t-in-rtf> and then who needs it soon enough that it has to be rolled today
2020-05-15T13:59:46  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2020-05-15T14:00:34  <jhernandez> we all know who needs it soon enough
2020-05-15T14:00:43  <jhernandez> but QA won't put their hands on it until Monday
2020-05-15T14:01:36  <jhernandez> you know that I'm not for creating anything that we all know that is incomplete in many ways
2020-05-15T14:03:55  <jhernandez> so it's fine if you want me to put things together (even some of them that aren't in master yet) and create a sneak peek build
2020-05-15T14:04:14  <Bosmon> jhernandez - sure
2020-05-15T14:04:20  <jhernandez> I'm also fine not doing anything
2020-05-15T14:04:22  <Bosmon> Also I think #198 can be merged : P
2020-05-15T14:04:22  <jhernandez> :P
2020-05-15T14:04:38  <Bosmon> I was thinking of merging in the capture branch at least, "pro forma"
2020-05-15T14:04:40  <Bosmon> If its tests pass
2020-05-15T14:04:44  <Bosmon> Even if the app doesn't start
2020-05-15T14:04:56  <Bosmon> Out of interest, do you know how the app built by your installer starts? : P
2020-05-15T14:05:54  <jhernandez> yes, #198 can go in, I just gave him another try while I set up other things
2020-05-15T14:06:08  <jhernandez> didn't create any installer yet
2020-05-15T14:06:15  <Bosmon> Well you made one before
2020-05-15T14:06:18  <jhernandez> the other day I created one but it wasn't starting
2020-05-15T14:06:22  <Bosmon> Out of "1.3.x" stuff
2020-05-15T14:06:28  <jhernandez> yup, out of 1.3.x
2020-05-15T14:07:14  <jhernandez> right now I'm building from source and I'll give it a try
2020-05-15T14:12:22  <the-t-in-rtf> as long as it's a sneak peek and isn't somehow knighted as 1.3.5 I'm fine
2020-05-15T14:30:41  <gmoss> jhung: will you be joining sachin10101998 and me for a quick chat?
2020-05-15T14:30:45  <sachin10101998> gmoss would you be available for the meeting

2020-05-15T15:57:16  <greatislander> gmoss My initial thought is that rather than adding an aria-label it might be better to wrap the symbol in `<span aria-hidden="true">` so that only the text content of the link is read by screen readers.
2020-05-15T15:57:40  <greatislander> (this is re: your FLUID-6454 pr, sachin10101998)
2020-05-15T15:58:57  <sachin10101998> ^ the solution by greatislander seems more plausible gmoss
2020-05-15T15:59:32  <greatislander> My rationale for this is that it means that we don't need to have the same text in two places (as text content and as an aria-label), and also aria-labels aren't translated by webpage translation tools like Google Translate so using the element's text content makes it easier for non-English speakers to have a good experience if they translate the page
2020-05-15T16:01:00  <greatislander> (see: https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/aria-label-does-not-translate.html)
2020-05-15T16:01:22  <sachin10101998> Not to mention, the navbars are currently present on top and bottom of the page but only the top one has title attribute and the bottom one does not have it.

2020-05-15T16:16:55  <gmoss> greatislander: sorry I was afk. I think I'd misunderstood what you were suggesting in your initial comment on the Jira. I thought you were suggesting having a hidden span with the text we want to read out, which I thought wouldn't work :) but the approach you're suggesting sounds reasonable! My reasoning for suggesting `aria-label` was to maintain the "page" part of the announcement, but that may not be critical
2020-05-15T16:17:50  <greatislander> oh yeah, looking back now… that could still be done too
2020-05-15T16:20:20  <greatislander> ```html<a href="#"><span class="aria-hidden">< </span>Previous <span class="screen-reader-text">Page </span></a>```
2020-05-15T16:20:25  <greatislander> oops
2020-05-15T16:20:33  <greatislander> ```html
2020-05-15T16:20:33  <greatislander> <a href="#"><span class="aria-hidden">< </span>Previous <span class="screen-reader-text">Page </span></a>
2020-05-15T16:20:33  <greatislander> ```
2020-05-15T16:20:53  <greatislander> and the following rule for `.screen-reader-text`:
2020-05-15T16:21:11  <greatislander> ```
2020-05-15T16:21:11  <greatislander> position: absolute;
2020-05-15T16:21:12  <greatislander> width: 1px;
2020-05-15T16:21:12  <greatislander> height: 1px;
2020-05-15T16:21:12  <greatislander> padding: 0;
2020-05-15T16:21:12  <greatislander> margin: -1px;
2020-05-15T16:21:12  <greatislander> overflow: hidden;
2020-05-15T16:21:13  <greatislander> clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);

2020-05-15T16:21:14  <greatislander> border-width: 0;
2020-05-15T16:21:14  <greatislander> ```
2020-05-15T16:21:21  <greatislander> (hides visually, leaves accessible for AT)
2020-05-15T16:23:43  <sachin10101998> <a href="#"><span class="aria-hidden">< Previous</span> <span class="screen-reader-text">Page </span></a
2020-05-15T16:23:48  <sachin10101998> Is this what you mean?
2020-05-15T16:25:23  <sachin10101998> What's the use of <span class="aria-hidden">< </span> if there's nothing inside the span? greatislander
2020-05-15T16:26:26  <greatislander> sachin10101998: the markup you are showing would appear visually as "< Previous" but would be read by a screen reader as "Page".
2020-05-15T16:26:59  <greatislander> ```<span class="aria-hidden">< </span>``` prevents the "lesser than" symbol (<) from being read by the screen reader.
2020-05-15T16:27:26  <sachin10101998> Oops. Missed the "<" there. Sorry, my bad

2020-05-15T20:01:04  <Teddy___> Is there a recommended way to mention jira issues in github PRs?
2020-05-15T20:01:32  <Teddy___> for now I just pasted the link inside the PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/991
2020-05-15T20:03:22  <sachin10101998> you can just begin the title of the Pr with the jira issue number
2020-05-15T20:03:43  <sachin10101998> it will automatically update the status in issue tracker too
2020-05-15T20:04:10  <Teddy___> nice!
2020-05-15T20:04:13  <Teddy___> thank you
2020-05-15T20:04:54  <sachin10101998> you can change the title to "FLUID-6499: added font display swap for font faces"

2020-05-15T21:48:42  <gmoss> Teddy___ sachin10101998: I think the automatic updating of Jira status is actually based on the commit messages, not necessarily the PR title alone (I can't confirm if title does anything or not, though it is very helpful). Also, the exact workflow changes/updates in Jira based on GitHub actions are customizable per project, so it will also depend on those settings iirc
2020-05-15T21:48:59  <gmoss> *GitHub actions = things you do on GitHub, I don't mean GitHub Actions :)
2020-05-15T21:51:42  <Teddy___> Okay thanks gmoss good to know
2020-05-15T21:52:30  <Teddy___> When I changed the title of my PR it updates the status of the Jira from “open” to “pull request”
2020-05-15T21:55:04  <sachin10101998> Teddy___ something doesn't seem correct with your PR
2020-05-15T21:55:23  <sachin10101998> Your commits have commits which have already been merged with master branch
2020-05-15T21:55:37  <sachin10101998> Did you update or sync your fork with master before sending PR?
2020-05-15T22:01:25  <sachin10101998> gmoss Teddy___ the triggers which update JIRA status can be put into action either by pull request title or commit messages . It all depends on which triggers have been set up in the JIRA settings. All the PRs which i sent till now have had JIRA issue number both i n title and commit, so I can't really comment on which triggers are enabled but if teddy says that the status changed in JIRA only after he edited the PR title, I guess only the PR
2020-05-15T22:01:26  <sachin10101998> trigger has been set up or enabled in settings.
2020-05-15T22:03:20  <gmoss> sachin10101998: yeah it would seem that's the case for Infusion, at least! in my repo (sjrk-story-telling), if my PR has a message that starts with a Jira number different from the title of the PR, that issue also gets updated, hence my comment.

2020-05-15T22:03:49  <gmoss> *if a commit message contains a Jira number, sorry, it doesn't have to start with it
2020-05-15T22:04:08  <gmoss> I've had issues update unintentionally in the past
2020-05-15T22:04:25  <sachin10101998> Ohhh
2020-05-15T22:10:04  <sachin10101998> Teddy___ there's something terribly wrong with the commits in your PR. The commit
2020-05-15T22:10:04  <sachin10101998> 7138650 to 19c8943 have already been merged to master and they should not be present here. This is probably because you didn't sync your fork with the master before sending a PR or the head was not correctly set before you sent PR. You can't edit commits after a PR has been sent, but you can keep a check on commits by using GUI clients like smartGit.
2020-05-15T22:11:22  <Teddy___> It’s because I rebased the last 10 commits instead of just my own
2020-05-15T22:12:03  <Teddy___> But I think github will just ignore the commits that are duplicates and just merge the new ones
2020-05-15T22:12:15  <sachin10101998> I'm not sure of it.
2020-05-15T22:12:35  <sachin10101998> gmoss?
2020-05-15T22:12:43  <Teddy___> Should I do another rebase?

2020-05-15T22:14:09  <gmoss> Teddy___ sachin10101998: I'll have to take a close look at the commit contents to be sure, but GitHub is pretty clever about not merging in changes that are already present. checking the "files changed" can be a good way to "preview" what effect merging the PR into its target branch will have.
2020-05-15T22:14:26  <gmoss> fwiw, I tend not to rebase, I usually just merge master into my dev branch when I want to update
2020-05-15T22:14:58  <gmoss> I'm also one of those people that never deletes branches, so you may not necessarily want to follow my git habits :)
2020-05-15T22:15:12  <sachin10101998> Files changed shows duplicate content though.
2020-05-15T22:15:17  <sachin10101998> haha ^
2020-05-15T22:16:04  <sachin10101998> contents that have been changed already in earlier commits is present again.
2020-05-15T22:19:58  <gmoss> sachin10101998: hmm sure enough, the same commit seems to be there with different hashes
2020-05-15T22:20:02  <gmoss> very interesting

2020-05-15T22:20:38  <sachin10101998> I wonder what would happen if the PR is merged haha
2020-05-15T22:21:11  <gmoss> SO to the rescue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16306012/github-pull-request-showing-commits-that-are-already-in-target-branch
2020-05-15T22:21:23  <gmoss> I'm going to see if going to the URL suggested in the fix sheds any light on what will happen
2020-05-15T22:22:20  <gmoss> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/compare/master...TeddTech:master
2020-05-15T22:22:35  <gmoss> still looks like those changes are going to be merged in. very curious
2020-05-15T22:23:15  <sachin10101998> if new hashes have been created how will the diffing algo work when the initial files are similar to final files.
2020-05-15T22:23:55  <gmoss> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-05-15T22:24:00  <gmoss> that's a very good question haha
2020-05-15T22:24:25  <sachin10101998> haha
2020-05-15T22:24:46  <sachin10101998> is there any specific git expert in the community?
2020-05-15T22:24:51  <gmoss> Whomever is reviewing this PR is likely to have very strong git skills, hopefully they can solve the mystery :)
2020-05-15T22:25:12  <Teddy___> Should I do a rebase where I remove those duplicate commits and only keep my own
2020-05-15T22:25:36  <gmoss> Teddy___: that might do the trick!
2020-05-15T22:25:43  <sachin10101998> yeah. I'd make a dummy repo and see what happens. Just for experimentation
2020-05-15T22:26:16  <sachin10101998> cindyli is reviewing it but she didn't leave any comment regarding the commit history
2020-05-15T22:27:31  <gmoss> O'
2020-05-15T22:27:50  <gmoss> * I'm betting she hasn't done a full review at this point, since it's the weekend for most people now

2020-05-15T22:56:41  <sachin10101998> Teddy___ you should avoid sending PRs from main branch of your fork.Best practice is to create a feature branch for suggesting changes or sending PRs and in case the PR gets merged you can update the main by git fetch upstream
