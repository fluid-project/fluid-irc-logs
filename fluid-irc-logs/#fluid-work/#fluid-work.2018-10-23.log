2018-10-23T12:51:33  <georgitodorov> Bosmon, jhernandez: I have been investigating the issue with the GPII app slowness when using Electron 3
2018-10-23T12:52:41  <georgitodorov> The only slowness which I have noticed is when opening the QSS dialog - in this case the button becomes white half a second later
2018-10-23T12:53:45  <georgitodorov> I have come to the conclusion that this slowness is not caused by Electron 3. Today I deleted the node_modules folder and while using Electron 1.8.8 the same slowness is observed. Also, I tried out the latest installer and the issue is present there as well
2018-10-23T12:55:01  <georgitodorov> I went back our git history to check where the problem started to appear. This is the place: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/commit/4f0723f42def7a9a6d5ba0de0ce59bfa6fe9e46a
2018-10-23T12:55:47  <georgitodorov> When we changed the "gpii-windows" version from a "feds-audit" version to a later (dev) one
2018-10-23T12:56:53  <georgitodorov> As I am not familiar with the gpii-windows and gpii-universal code, I am not sure what may be causing such a noticeable delay in the PSP. Any ideas?
2018-10-23T12:57:16  <georgitodorov> stegru, can you also think of something regarding this ^ ?
2018-10-23T12:57:44  <jhernandez> georgitodorov: oh wow, interesting
2018-10-23T12:58:16  <jhernandez> thanks a lot for taking a closer look at this
2018-10-23T12:58:20  <jhernandez> :)
2018-10-23T12:58:34  <stegru> it's probably something I've done - it usually is :(
2018-10-23T12:59:13  <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello... has the installer for the pilots been built?
2018-10-23T12:59:43  <jhernandez> Justin_o: hey. I delivered one on last Frifay
2018-10-23T13:00:09  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks.. do you know when the next one will be built?
2018-10-23T13:00:17  <jhernandez> no, not yet
2018-10-23T13:00:24  *** cindyli <cindyli!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-qdbrkwelbyvmleol> has joined #fluid-work
2018-10-23T13:00:33  <jhernandez> I guess that we'll decide over the day/tomorrow
2018-10-23T13:01:01  <Justin_o> jhernandez: okay thanks... the reason i ask is that an onboarding change i made related to the contrasts was merged. However, the corresponding UIO+ PR has not been merged yet and is waiting on an Infusion PR to be merged first.
2018-10-23T13:01:18  <jhernandez> we need to see what needs to go in, what not, etc
2018-10-23T13:02:01  <stegru> georgitodorov - what is going slow?
2018-10-23T13:02:10  <Justin_o> jhernandez: okay great.. I just need to sort of time the UIO+ PR merging for the contrasts because if it is out-of-sync with Universal one of the contrast settings will not work
2018-10-23T13:02:25  <jhernandez> so, I don't see a new installer build coming until Friday or even next week. not sure
2018-10-23T13:03:01  <jhernandez> Justin_o: yeah, I knew that for the last one you would need a small update on universal
2018-10-23T13:03:13  <jhernandez> it's on my radar
2018-10-23T13:03:20  <jhernandez> ;)
2018-10-23T13:03:54  <jhernandez> Justin_o: oh, and btw, about https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3470
2018-10-23T13:04:02  <jhernandez> this one was initially reported by Maureen
2018-10-23T13:04:08  <georgitodorov> stegru: When you click a QSS button which displays a menu (e.g. "High / Low Contrast", "Language", "App / Text Zoom", "Screen Zoom"), the QSS menu appears instantly but the QSS button becomes activated (e.g. blue text on white background) some time later (500 ms on my machine)
2018-10-23T13:04:45  <stegru> ok
2018-10-23T13:05:11  <georgitodorov> I tried the current GPII app code with a feds-audit gpii-windows and it was working without this slowness
2018-10-23T13:05:30  <stegru> yes, because you knew we'd blame you ;)
2018-10-23T13:05:36  <jhernandez> hmm
2018-10-23T13:05:43  <georgitodorov> I am beyond confused how a change in gpii-windows can influence the PSP in such a way
2018-10-23T13:06:42  <jhernandez> well, let's say that the feds-audit branch is significantly different to what it's in master now
2018-10-23T13:07:04  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/compare/feds-audit...b61e5d183f0957fa016322ba736e699d3157b365?expand=1
2018-10-23T13:07:08  <jhernandez> the noUser implementation
2018-10-23T13:07:36  <jhernandez> is different
2018-10-23T13:08:24  <jhernandez> I can't think of any particular change that may affect that particular slowness when opening the QSS menu
2018-10-23T13:08:41  <jhernandez> metrics stuff?
2018-10-23T13:08:45  * jhernandez shrugs
2018-10-23T13:08:51  <stegru> that's my suspicion
2018-10-23T13:09:25  <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Do you see the slowness when trying the installer from Friday?
2018-10-23T13:09:36  <jhernandez> stegru: I told you, you were writing malware
2018-10-23T13:10:53  <georgitodorov> jhernandez, stegru: What are the metrics you are talking about?
2018-10-23T13:11:59  <stegru> well, the one in particular that I'm thinking of, is where it's listening to windows messages
2018-10-23T13:13:17  <georgitodorov> stegru: weren't these implemented after 2nd October?
2018-10-23T13:13:32  <georgitodorov> or rather merged into master?
2018-10-23T13:14:08  <stegru> there's the window activation, which I changed to listen for messages (instead of polling).
2018-10-23T13:14:32  <jhernandez> georgitodorov: I can see a small delay, yes, but can't remember how it behaves with the feds-audit build
2018-10-23T13:14:56  <georgitodorov> jhernandez: it's immediate there
2018-10-23T13:15:14  <georgitodorov> jhernandez: And the delay you see with the installer - is it the same as with Electron 3?
2018-10-23T13:15:55  <jhernandez> heh, interesting, which installer did you use to test feds-audit? or did you just build from source?
2018-10-23T13:16:15  <georgitodorov> jhernandez: from source, yes
2018-10-23T13:16:36  <jhernandez> georgitodorov: can't tell, when I tried electron 3 the slowness was very noticeable to me
2018-10-23T13:17:54  <jhernandez> my concern about the update to electron 3 is that we are also replacing the ffi module with ffi-napi
2018-10-23T13:18:38  <stegru> georgitodorov, can I produce a branch of gpii-windows for you to try?
2018-10-23T13:19:00  <georgitodorov> stegru: sure
2018-10-23T13:19:22  <jhernandez> and given that I didn't have much time to dig into the electron 3 thing (we had to put a build together) I stopped there
2018-10-23T13:19:42  <jhernandez> that's why I created the ajc3 branch of windows
2018-10-23T13:20:03  <jhernandez> to avoid ffi-napi and electron 3, just in case
2018-10-23T13:20:47  <jhernandez> but looks like stegru's has some ideas already
2018-10-23T13:21:16  <jhernandez> we both thought about the metrics ... which is a THING
2018-10-23T13:21:18  <jhernandez> xDD
2018-10-23T13:24:39  <stegru> yes, ffi-napi could make a difference
2018-10-23T13:29:30  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks,  and thanks for pointing me at the issue about the play button. I'll take a look.
2018-10-23T13:35:35  <stegru> georgitodorov, try "stegru/windows#slowness-test" for the "gpii-windows" dependency
2018-10-23T13:35:58  <stegru> I've removed some code which I think is slowing it down

2018-10-23T13:39:34  <georgitodorov> stegru: I will try only the QSS menu opening which was the only slow thing I noticed

2018-10-23T13:42:12  <stegru> ok
2018-10-23T13:42:25  <stegru> can you try it with GPII_TEST=1 set in the environment?
2018-10-23T13:43:10  <stegru> that shouldn't make a difference to the speed
2018-10-23T13:44:27  <stegru> and then try with GPII_TEST=2, if it's still fast then try GPII_TEST=3

2018-10-23T14:48:49  <cindyli> Bosmon: need your suggestion again. i'm working on adding readiness and liveness endpoints for the prefs server and the cloud based flow manager. There are 2 cases I need to handle:
2018-10-23T14:49:30  <cindyli> 1. when CBFM and PS (preferences server) are running as one kettle server, the liveness on this server checks the db connection
2018-10-23T14:50:08  <cindyli> 2. when they are running as separate kettle servers, the liveness on PS checks the db connection and the one on CBFM checks the connection to PS
2018-10-23T14:50:35  <cindyli> I'm thinking to use "fluid.contextAware.makeChecks" to distinguish these 2 cases
2018-10-23T14:51:33  <cindyli> by checking the gradenames that the current kettle server is composed of
2018-10-23T14:52:34  <cindyli> such as, when "gpii.preferencesServer" and "gpii.flowManager.cloudBased" are both detected on the kettle, case 1 is detected. otherwise, case 2
2018-10-23T14:53:05  <cindyli> my first question is, is this correct or the easiest solution?
2018-10-23T14:53:27  <cindyli> the 2nd question is, from the example of contextAware:
2018-10-23T14:53:29  <cindyli> fluid.contextAware.makeChecks({
2018-10-23T14:53:29  <cindyli>     "fluid.supportsTTS": "fluid.textToSpeech.isSupported"
2018-10-23T14:53:29  <cindyli> });
2018-10-23T14:54:06  <cindyli> the check function "fluid.textToSpeech.isSupported" looks like a standalone. how can i pass "{kettle}" to it?

2018-10-23T17:27:19  <clown> jhung, Justin_o: I'm finally getting back to this — autocomplete.
2018-10-23T17:27:41  <clown> Here is the link to the APG section on comboboxes (a case where autocomplete is sometimes used):  https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#combobox
2018-10-23T17:28:02  <clown> There's a set of links to working examples within that section…
2018-10-23T17:28:15  <jhung> thanks clown. I'll take a look.
2018-10-23T17:28:46  <clown> but the link to the examples is not working (sigh).  Scroll down to "Examples".
2018-10-23T17:28:54  <clown> your welcome, jhug
