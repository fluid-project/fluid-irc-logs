2019-12-17T13:17:57  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey there
2019-12-17T13:18:36  <jhernandez> I was finally coming back to GPII-4065 (download the reset-to-std file at startup)
2019-12-17T13:19:07  <jhernandez> but I was wondering whether we should do this from the service instead
2019-12-17T13:19:43  <jhernandez> right now, the service is pulling the siteconfig
2019-12-17T13:20:33  <jhernandez> and not sure if it's a good idea or we should stick to the plan and do it from universal
2019-12-17T13:21:30  <Bosmon> I wonder why the service is pulling it
2019-12-17T13:22:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o, gmoss - I've pushed a fix for the framework issue you uncovered in SJRK-318 to the FLUID-6148 and FLUID-6145 branches
2019-12-17T13:24:58  <jhernandez> Bosmon: well, this is how stegru implemented it - which made sense to me :P
2019-12-17T13:26:05  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well sure, but why? : P
2019-12-17T13:29:20  <jhernandez> well, the need for downloading it + the fact that gpii-app needs to startup in a particular way depending on the metrics switch
2019-12-17T13:29:41  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I see
2019-12-17T13:29:46  <Bosmon> What gets passed along to it when it starts?
2019-12-17T13:33:10  <jhernandez> this is the service.json5 file for the last version of the service
2019-12-17T13:33:14  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-morphic-site-resources/blob/d10262f8f9bda14dc67f37734bb07c241edefb39/ajc3/1.3.0-dev.20191205T114812Z.268bb94b.GPII-4214.GPII-3572/service.json5

2019-12-17T13:33:54  <jhernandez> and gpii-app uses a different config according to this block https://github.com/GPII/gpii-morphic-site-resources/blob/d10262f8f9bda14dc67f37734bb07c241edefb39/ajc3/1.3.0-dev.20191205T114812Z.268bb94b.GPII-4214.GPII-3572/service.json5#L35-L44
2019-12-17T13:45:50  <jhernandez> this is, it sets up the NODE_ENV to launch gpii-app

2019-12-17T14:20:30  <cindyli> Bosmon: my pull request for GPII-3828 is ready for another review - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/820. thanks. for the next task, i have other 2 jiras on my to do list:
2019-12-17T14:20:31  <cindyli> GPII-3936: Prevent the security issue with using a USB with NOVA computers to create GPII key and prefs safe
2019-12-17T14:20:31  <cindyli> GPII-4063: Ensure that QuickStrip stores only application-specific terms scoped to applications
2019-12-17T14:20:48  <cindyli> i'm thinking to start working on GPII-3939
2019-12-17T14:21:08  <cindyli> if you feel GPII-4063 or any other items have higher priority, please let me know. thanks

2019-12-17T16:10:33  <cindyli> ok. thanks, Bosmon
2019-12-17T16:12:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: this doesn't seem to work, but I wanted to check that it was expected.

2019-12-17T16:13:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - no chance for that to work, no
2019-12-17T16:14:34  <Bosmon> Perhaps you expect the framework to spot you getting out of bed in the morning and work out whether you look like you need a cup of tea : P
2019-12-17T16:16:18  <michelled> I mean, I should assume so! ;)

2019-12-17T17:00:27  <gmoss> Teddy_: we like to attach a one-liner subject to the schedule, what would you like me to put on it? It can just be "TBD" for now if you'd rather think about it later
2019-12-17T17:00:48  <Justin_o> gmoss, Teddy_: thanks, sounds great.
2019-12-17T17:01:24  <Teddy_> "Machine Learning: What it can and can't do"

2019-12-17T17:04:43  <Teddy_> @gmoss how long should it be?
2019-12-17T17:09:05  <gmoss> Teddy_: the time slot is 2:30 to 4:00 EST, so 1.5hr would be your maximum, ideally. It can certainly be shorter, you can leave room for discussion, etc.

2019-12-17T20:26:38  <Bosmon> Hi there gmoss - I rolled a release 3.0.0-dev.20191217T132155Z.129800677.FLUID-6145 and checked out your branch with it and I seemed to be able to change the language fine
2019-12-17T20:26:47  <Bosmon> Also I could see any huge slowdown - what should I do to provoke this?
2019-12-17T20:28:16  <gmoss> Bosmon: thanks for the release! I'll try that out presently. So for me to see the slowdown issue, I open up a new tab in Chrome, hit F12 for DevTools and navigate to the site (this is with a docker db container and the Kettle server running)
2019-12-17T20:28:20  <gmoss> (not via docker-compose)
2019-12-17T20:28:38  <gmoss> Bosmon: it's not every time, but about 3/4 of the time
2019-12-17T20:30:33  <gmoss> Bosmon: I just tried to load the browse page and it's hanging, nearly a minute of 20% CPU usage and the page isn't loading, Kettle isn't saying anything :(

2019-12-17T20:32:09  <michelled> I'm free now :)
2019-12-17T20:32:50  <michelled> standup room?
2019-12-17T20:32:56  <gmoss> michelled: sounds good to me. cindyli ?
2019-12-17T20:40:08  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-12-17T20:41:35  <gmoss> Bosmon: if it helps, my env is Windows 10 v1903
2019-12-17T20:41:39  <gmoss> Chrome 79
2019-12-17T20:43:18  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has joined #fluid-work
2019-12-17T20:43:54  <cindyli> gmoss, michelled, sorry, missed your message, let me know if you are still waiting for me
2019-12-17T20:44:29  <michelled> cindyli: we did a quick check in - gmoss is going to try out Bosmon's latest updates to see if it fixes things for him
2019-12-17T20:44:31  <gmoss> cindyli: no worries at all. michelled and I met up and I updated her on the situation of the work re SJRK-255
2019-12-17T20:44:40  <gmoss> also what she just said :)
2019-12-17T20:44:45  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2019-12-17T20:44:54  <michelled> I should have guessed with both of us typing at the same time :D
2019-12-17T20:46:30  <gmoss> Bosmon: what does your config file look like?
2019-12-17T20:47:51  <gmoss> Bosmon: I've been using the base theme (no "theme" key in the config) to test mutlilingual things, so I suppose it's possible that's a factor
2019-12-17T20:48:09  <gmoss> But I don't think so, based on testing that just now
2019-12-17T20:51:41  <gmoss> Bosmon: can confirm that your dev release behaves the same as when I built dist from your branch. TOC bug is gone, but panels no longer update on language change
2019-12-17T20:52:04  <gmoss> sorry to bombard you, btw, just want to give as much detail as possible in case something is pertinent
2019-12-17T21:00:44  <Bosmon> gmoss - oh yes, I see
2019-12-17T21:01:04  <Bosmon> Only the TOC and the show/hide controls localise
2019-12-17T21:01:11  <Bosmon> And the panels don't, is that what you see?
2019-12-17T21:01:57  <gmoss> Bosmon: that's correct
2019-12-17T21:02:03  <gmoss> in addition to the page also localizing
2019-12-17T21:02:12  <gmoss> but from UIO's perspective, yes just the TOC and tab
2019-12-17T21:02:41  <Bosmon> gmoss - although I do see that UIO relocalises if I reload the page
2019-12-17T21:02:41  <gmoss> and of course the sliding panel closing every time because we have to recreate it for the locale change to work
2019-12-17T21:02:44  <Bosmon> Do you see that too?
2019-12-17T21:03:04  <gmoss> Bosmon: let me confirm, page is hanging again hahaha
2019-12-17T21:03:11  <Bosmon> Very odd
2019-12-17T21:03:14  <Bosmon> I never see the hanging
2019-12-17T21:03:28  <Bosmon> I assume it looks like the client is using the CPU rather than the server?
2019-12-17T21:03:38  <gmoss> Bosmon: confirmed, UIO panels are localized properly on page load
2019-12-17T21:04:03  <gmoss> Bosmon: right, in the Task Manager it's Chrome that's using all my CPU and ram, not Kettle/PowerShell
2019-12-17T21:04:23  <gmoss> and no log messages on the server
2019-12-17T21:04:44  <Bosmon> gmoss - very odd
2019-12-17T21:04:56  <Bosmon> The page doesn't load terribly slowly for me and doesn't produce any abnormal-looking memory load
2019-12-17T21:05:46  <Bosmon> Perhaps I need to create some more content?
2019-12-17T21:05:51  <gmoss> Bosmon: do you have the DevTools open while you load? it only happens then, for me
2019-12-17T21:05:59  <colinclark> gmoss: while you’re both here, here is a link to Antranig’s paper, which I mentioned earlier: https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf
2019-12-17T21:06:14  <gmoss> Bosmon: this happens on the browse page with only the example story present
2019-12-17T21:06:16  <gmoss> colinclark: thanks!
2019-12-17T21:06:35  <Bosmon> gmoss - yes, I have them open
2019-12-17T21:06:48  <gmoss> Bosmon: very strange
2019-12-17T21:06:52  <Bosmon> Rather essential in order to debug your issue from yesterday
2019-12-17T21:07:12  <gmoss> Bosmon: I would have assumed as much! :) maybe it's environmental then... but windows hasn't changed, only Chrome has updated recently
2019-12-17T21:07:15  <Bosmon> This paper might shed some light on why it is that we find ourselves working in this peculiar-looking way :)
2019-12-17T21:07:21  <colinclark> gmoss: This one is also very good, in terms of looking at some of the values that Infusion proposes, but from the perspective of several different programming languages: https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/ppig-2016a/ppig2016a.pdf
2019-12-17T21:07:56  <Bosmon> gmoss - I've tried in two different versions of Chrome now
2019-12-17T21:08:26  <Bosmon> The current version 79 and my captive version of Chromium 73 ....
2019-12-17T21:08:42  <colinclark> And lastly, the Webstrates page which has some great videos of Clemen’s work: https://webstrates.net/
2019-12-17T21:09:11  <gmoss> Bosmon: it's very strange. it loads within 1 or 2 seconds, but the moment I open DevTools it drops the ball and won't load at all, or will take several minutes
2019-12-17T21:09:38  <gmoss> colinclark: thanks for those links! I think I have read the first paper, but i'll give it another read since this isn't the same version, and I'll check out the other two links :)
2019-12-17T21:10:09  <Bosmon> gmoss - sometimes slowdowns I've seen like this are due to Chrome trying to debug into some environmental, minified or injected scripts
2019-12-17T21:10:32  <Bosmon> Perhaps you managed to accidentally dump a breakpoint into some huge pile of minified garbage someday : P
2019-12-17T21:10:46  <Bosmon> This is part of the reason I tend to debug with my captive Chromium rather than my workaday Chrome ....
2019-12-17T21:10:52  <gmoss> Bosmon: hmm... my breakpoints list is empty and no other scripts are open. otherwise we're loading the same scripts, yes?
2019-12-17T21:11:21  <Bosmon> gmoss - right, unless you have some extensions
2019-12-17T21:11:27  <Bosmon> I have one very badly-behaved extension, LastPass
2019-12-17T21:11:38  <Bosmon> Which injects all manner of garbage, even on localhost, and even when you tell it not to
2019-12-17T21:11:49  <gmoss> Bosmon: I don't run many extensions at all, but let me make sure UIO+ is off :P
2019-12-17T21:13:41  <gmoss> Bosmon: UIO+ was off. I had EditThisCookie on, it has never caused issues in the past, that didn't make a difference when turned off sadly. Otherwise the only non-Google extensions I have are uBlock Origin and Postman, which I'll try presently
2019-12-17T21:14:34  <gmoss> no effect, as expectedf
2019-12-17T21:14:37  <gmoss> was worth a shot :)
2019-12-17T21:14:42  <Bosmon> gmoss - does anyone else see the slowdown?
2019-12-17T21:15:00  <gmoss> Bosmon: not as far as I'm aware. Only cindyli and perhaps Justin_o have been running it, as far as I know
2019-12-17T21:15:41  <gmoss> Bosmon: this hasn't been an issue in the past, so I suspect it may have to do with the recent changes. Pinning it down may prove very difficult
2019-12-17T21:16:00  <Bosmon> gmoss - well, the profiler is always a good port of call
2019-12-17T21:16:12  <Bosmon> But if the issue only manifests with the dev tools, it's going to be something pretty peculiar
2019-12-17T21:16:21  *** christop_ <christop_!~textual@24.54.251.55> has joined #fluid-work
2019-12-17T21:16:26  <gmoss> Bosmon: sadly the profiler is also hanging, and when it finally un-hangs, the page runs just fine
2019-12-17T21:16:36  <gmoss> it's quite curious
2019-12-17T21:17:15  <gmoss> I tried opening DevTools on http://stories.sojustrepairit.org/ to see if it affected that, and it seemed to run fine
2019-12-17T21:17:36  <Bosmon> very very odd
2019-12-17T21:17:41  <Bosmon> Are you always doing this in a docker image?
2019-12-17T21:17:45  <Bosmon> Or on your baremetal machine?
2019-12-17T21:17:51  <gmoss> Bosmon: I'm going to switch to the stories-floe-dev branch to see if it's my env or the code
2019-12-17T21:18:08  <gmoss> bare metal, usually. I run the docker-compose process when I test before opening PR's
2019-12-17T21:18:48  <gmoss> Bosmon: i'll run docker-compose and see if it still happens, before I try the old code
2019-12-17T21:24:59  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-12-17T21:27:56  <gmoss> Bosmon: still hangs even hosted from a docker container. the issue DOES persist even running on pre-6148/6145 code, but I do see server activity this time and the page loads eventually (still 20s or so).
2019-12-17T21:28:22  <Bosmon> I really wonder what it is doing in that time
2019-12-17T21:28:25  <Bosmon> How about Firefox?
2019-12-17T21:32:38  <gmoss> Bosmon: Firefox seems unaffected. in fact the problem with Firefox is that it requests so quickly that it takes the server down hahaha
2019-12-17T21:33:16  <gmoss> this is a different known issue, one that Justin_o and I were in the process of trying to repro before filing a Jira. I think we got caught up in other work and never filed it, but I think *that* is an issue with Kettle
2019-12-17T21:37:58  <gmoss> Bosmon: Edge is also fine

2019-12-17T22:58:35  <Bosmon> gmoss - the issue only manifests on Windows?
