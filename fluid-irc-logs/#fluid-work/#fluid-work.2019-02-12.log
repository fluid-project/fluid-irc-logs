2019-02-12T11:19:06  <jhernandez> stegru: Bosmon hey there
2019-02-12T11:19:13  <stegru> hi
2019-02-12T11:19:36  <jhernandez> FYI, I've got an installer with the windows service
2019-02-12T11:19:41  <jhernandez> awesome!!
2019-02-12T11:19:56  <stegru> oh great
2019-02-12T11:19:59  <jhernandez> gpii-app pops up first - which is great
2019-02-12T11:20:15  <jhernandez> you kill it, it gets restarted
2019-02-12T11:20:29  <jhernandez> BUT
2019-02-12T11:21:05  <jhernandez> I'm experiencing very weird behaviors when using "reset all to std"
2019-02-12T11:22:16  <stegru> ok
2019-02-12T11:22:19  <jhernandez> at some point, gpii-app crashed and the service got it restarted
2019-02-12T11:25:24  <jhernandez> also, after keying in with a user, the OS ended up like this: https://pasteboard.co/I0OeDmb.png
2019-02-12T11:25:53  <Bosmon> Crikey!
2019-02-12T11:25:55  <Bosmon> So terrifying
2019-02-12T11:26:11  <stegru> ugh, it speaks to them in spanish?
2019-02-12T11:26:24  <Bosmon> Looks like Dutch to me
2019-02-12T11:26:32  <stegru> ah yes, i just assumed
2019-02-12T11:28:30  <jhernandez> yes, belgian dutch a.k.a. flemish
2019-02-12T11:28:52  <stegru> I thought we voted out of this!
2019-02-12T11:28:57  <jhernandez> hahaha
2019-02-12T11:30:16  <stegru> so gpii-app crashed completely? I don't think we've ever managed that
2019-02-12T11:30:22  <jhernandez> and one another thing, not sure if related - but my vbox at some point stopped working and the VM entered the "Guru meditation" mode
2019-02-12T11:30:49  <stegru> what's that?
2019-02-12T11:30:49  <jhernandez> which is the very first time I've ever seen it
2019-02-12T11:31:19  <jhernandez> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Meditation
2019-02-12T11:31:51  <stegru> ok
2019-02-12T11:33:07  <jhernandez> I guess it's a wink to Amiga's crash - but yeah, I got an error dialog coming from VM saying that vbox has crashed
2019-02-12T11:33:56  <jhernandez> and that if I wanted to either shutdown the vm or to leave it running for debugging
2019-02-12T11:35:47  <jhernandez> I chose the 2nd option and the vm was unresponsive and in the title bar you can see gpii-app_default_xxxxyyyyzzz [Guru Meditation]
2019-02-12T11:39:30  <jhernandez> here's the log line: 18:27:24.529592 Changing the VM state from 'RUNNING' to 'GURU_MEDITATION'
2019-02-12T11:40:00  <stegru> ok
2019-02-12T11:45:17  <jhernandez> here's the full vbox log, just in case it helps: https://pastebin.com/wHP2GpHh
2019-02-12T11:46:34  <jhernandez> as you can see, the VM got suspended and the error came when trying to resume it
2019-02-12T11:47:37  <jhernandez> stegru: do you want me to send you the installer I'm using?
2019-02-12T11:47:58  <stegru> yes, ok
2019-02-12T11:48:53  <jhernandez> the only different thing is that I applied this change https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/155#discussion_r255747554
2019-02-12T11:51:44  <stegru> ok
2019-02-12T11:52:08  <stegru> by the way, the NODE_ENV is there so I can say I've implemented the metrics on/off switch
2019-02-12T11:52:42  <stegru> that's the "switch" - a different config is used for turning it off (this is in another pr)
2019-02-12T11:57:15  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon , I was just updating the pull for the magnifier, and I found new settings to it, and I wanted to ask you about how to procede with a specific one that we could onboard, but may require of a special transform or a special settings handler, and wanted to know about which will be your criteria for deciding which path take
2019-02-12T11:57:45  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - what's the requirement?
2019-02-12T11:58:55  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there! Well, the settings in particular let's you position the magnifier window "anywhere in the screen" but the unit the use is pixels, so I wanted to use relative units for it, like "viewports" so we can make it portable
2019-02-12T12:00:22  <jhernandez> stegru: re NODE_ENV, ok got it, thanks
2019-02-12T12:00:26  <javjarfer[m]> So, for doing that I need the actual size of the screen, and for that I will need a special transform, so question will be, if I choose the special transform path, where should I put it? Should I declare it in universal, and let anyone implement it in Windows or other impl? Or should I follow embedding the behavior into a settings handler?
2019-02-12T12:01:24  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: also, I should mention that this settings *are not required* the only reason I was onboarding them was because I met then in the process of addressing the typo in your review comment
2019-02-12T12:10:42  <stegru> hmm.. there could be a resolver to get the screen dimensions.. ${{screen}.height}
2019-02-12T12:12:17  <stegru> javjarfer[m], when you set the value to be off the screen, see what happens if you manually change the resolution/dpi
2019-02-12T12:12:50  <stegru> if the window moves back into view, then we could try to send some window message to it
2019-02-12T12:13:26  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: that looks like another good approach, okay, will try that
2019-02-12T12:13:33  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I'd push that out for now since we need a solution for various issues such as https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3634 , https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2654 etc
2019-02-12T12:14:03  <Bosmon> And indeed, the system will run into difficulties when there is a change in screen size
2019-02-12T12:14:16  <Bosmon> So I would just punt on that and write up the requirement in a fresh JIRA linked to one of these

2019-02-12T13:34:50  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: thanks you, then I think we should wait for onboard this settings for when we have those features in place
2019-02-12T13:35:28  <javjarfer[m]> I will update the onboarding-sheet with the new features and link the issue that will mention those ones
