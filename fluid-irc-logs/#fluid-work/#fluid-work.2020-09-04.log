2020-09-04T17:41:33  <raunak> colin clark can you give me 5 minutes to discuss an issue in floe project and i found this issue after this website migrated to static site generator
2020-09-04T17:50:20  <gmoss> raunak: colinclark is offline for a few days. floeproject.org is going to have a redesign in the near future, so if it's a styling-related issue, then we probably aren't going to do much about it right now.
2020-09-04T17:50:31  <gmoss> thank you for finding it, either way!
