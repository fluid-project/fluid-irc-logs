2020-10-15T11:36:16  <Bosmon> Hey there greatislander - I was wondering if I could get some advice on where the cool kids are hosting WordPress sites these days
2020-10-15T11:40:25  <greatislander> Hi Bosmon, I'm a huge fan of using Trellis (https://roots.io/trellis/) with a $5/month virtual private server (I use Digital Ocean). It's a lot more technical than conventional WordPress shared hosting but the performance and security is fantastic.
2020-10-15T12:31:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in_: wondering if my lint related PRs are good to be merged. I'm reviewing a PR from greatislander and it also needs the updates to fluid-grunt-lint-all (see: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/37/files#diff-7ae45ad102eab3b6d7e7896acd08c427a9b25b346470d7bc6507b6481575d519R43)
2020-10-15T12:33:49  <the-t-in_> I think the pull against fluid-grunt-lint-all is ready, assuming that the new settings don't force any unwanted changes in the Infusion pull
2020-10-15T12:34:49  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: thanks, so we just need Bosmon to  sign off on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1013, and merge https://github.com/fluid-project/eslint-config-fluid/pull/8 then we can merge in https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/pull/15
2020-10-15T12:34:58  <the-t-in_> Seems like it to me.
2020-10-15T12:35:15  <the-t-in_> I did look at @greatislander's work earlier and left some feedback
2020-10-15T12:35:24  <the-t-in_> (on the CSS linting)
2020-10-15T12:35:56  <the-t-in_> but I think @Bosmon needs to take a look at the infusion pull related to that as well.
2020-10-15T12:36:03  <greatislander> the-t-in_: I think I've addressed it all now. I do think we will want to create a shared config for Stylelint along the lines of eslint-config-fluid which we can import and extend
2020-10-15T12:36:18  <the-t-in_> ah, great, I'll check my notifications
2020-10-15T12:38:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: does that configuration come through eslint's configuration or is it completely separated. Wondering if we can add it to the eslint-config-fluid or if we need a new repo.
2020-10-15T12:41:47  <greatislander> no, it's completely separate, Justin_o
2020-10-15T12:42:46  <Justin_o> greatislander: okay, is that something you are going to add as part of the CSS linting PR or an update after it is merged?
2020-10-15T12:43:28  <greatislander> It will necessitate creating a new repository and NPM package, so I think it should be a follow up to the CSS linting PR.
2020-10-15T12:43:40  <Justin_o> okay,
2020-10-15T12:53:42  <Bosmon> Oh, thanks so much greatislander - I'll poke around in it - actually my wife's site was already hosted as a Digital Ocean droplet, but I think basically from one of their standard "marketplace" WordPress instances
2020-10-15T12:54:42  <greatislander> No problem Bosmon! This involves Ansible and some other things that may be overkill. Another good option for managing a droplet with WordPress is https://spinupwp.com
2020-10-15T13:03:24  <Bosmon> Gosh wow
2020-10-15T13:03:30  <Bosmon> Such a bewildering array of options : P
2020-10-15T13:03:40  <Bosmon> Even for a "droplet" hosted in the same place ...
2020-10-15T13:03:58  <Bosmon> Ah wait, spinup does the hosting too
2020-10-15T13:17:24  <greatislander> I don't think Spinup does the hostingâ€” it provides an admin panel for a Droplet (so it handles all the WordPress configuration, databases, Nginx etc)
2020-10-15T13:17:40  <greatislander> Less command-line oriented alternative to Trellis, Bosmon :)
2020-10-15T15:08:00  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip, Teddy___, do you wanna have a little break before our tech check in?
2020-10-15T15:08:20  <Teddy___> cindyli yes please
2020-10-15T15:09:05  <cindyli> sure, Bosmon, philip, Teddy___: let meet at 11:15
2020-10-15T15:09:48  <Teddy___> cindyli okay
2020-10-15T15:10:00  <philip> cindyli: ok
2020-10-15T15:22:23  <cindyli> Bosmon: are you coming to the tech check in?
2020-10-15T15:37:03  <Teddy___> Bosmon, philip, cindyli: my apologies laptop died. I have received a medical phone call I have to take will be back on later
2020-10-15T17:04:17  <cindyli> philip: i found pharmacies that provide covid-19 tests are already listed on the testing locations webpage - https://covid-19.ontario.ca/assessment-centre-locations/, but I didn't find the open dataset for it
