2019-03-04T11:38:10  <Bosmon> Hi there jhernandez
2019-03-04T11:39:14  <Bosmon> We are working our way through https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/93 and seeing that things have got a bit tangled with our configs
2019-03-04T11:40:48  <Bosmon> Ah I see jhernandez you have just issued https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/749/files
2019-03-04T11:41:01  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey
2019-03-04T11:41:16  <Bosmon> My head is spinning a bit now
2019-03-04T11:41:19  <jhernandez> just seeing the update on pull/93
2019-03-04T11:41:39  <the-t-in-rtf> that's awesome, the shared directory is exactly for this kind of reuse
2019-03-04T11:42:32  <the-t-in-rtf> although it's for reuse between environments
2019-03-04T11:42:40  <Bosmon> But I am lost, what does this pull actually do :)
2019-03-04T11:43:50  <the-t-in-rtf> the second bit seems to now pull from the newer location of gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR
2019-03-04T11:44:00  <Bosmon> Was gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.local.json5 simply invalid before?
2019-03-04T11:44:08  <Bosmon> And if so, what did the failure look like?
2019-03-04T11:46:42  <jhernandez> I was getting this: Error: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Could not find a config file at any of the paths V:\node_modules\gpii-universal\gpii\configs\gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR
2019-03-04T11:47:15  <the-t-in-rtf> that is exactly what I would have expected
2019-03-04T11:47:27  <the-t-in-rtf> as it doesn't exist in that location in master now.
2019-03-04T11:47:28  <jhernandez> after digging in, I found out that the dynamicDR.local was pointing to the wrong config
2019-03-04T11:47:56  <jhernandez> well, not to the wrong config but the wrong location "configs" rather than "configs/shared"
2019-03-04T11:49:02  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/749/files#diff-04e9762f1dcd29ec14dc085592cdfcd2R27 "should" be a noop, but added the .json5 at the end for consistency with other configs
2019-03-04T11:57:22  <Bosmon> jhernandez - yeah, that sounds like a reasonable error - but what were you doing when you got the error?
2019-03-04T11:57:34  <Bosmon> I'm trying to think what the "natural" use of this config is : P
2019-03-04T11:57:48  <jhernandez> oh
2019-03-04T11:58:14  <jhernandez> instead of using the untrusted production config I wanted to run everything local
2019-03-04T11:58:56  <jhernandez> this is, untrusted.development.dynamicDR.manualTesting (formerly known as all.local)
2019-03-04T11:58:57  <Bosmon> OK, so you were just doing it by hand using the command line?
2019-03-04T11:59:05  <jhernandez> yup
2019-03-04T11:59:05  <Bosmon> And were you just running gpii-universal or some higher project?
2019-03-04T11:59:35  <jhernandez> doing it from gpii-app
2019-03-04T12:00:00  <Bosmon> OK
2019-03-04T12:00:18  <jhernandez> manually editing gpii-app/configs/app.base.json5
2019-03-04T12:00:22  <Bosmon> oh ok
2019-03-04T12:00:30  <jhernandez> and yes, we need to revisit gpii-app configs

2019-03-04T14:59:39  <Bosmon> Hey there stegru, jhernandez - what's the situation these days with the Windows Service?
2019-03-04T15:00:37  <stegru> it's going ok, Bosmon - I think it works
2019-03-04T15:00:49  <Bosmon> Awesome
2019-03-04T15:00:52  <jhernandez> Bosmon: stegru yeah, it works
2019-03-04T15:00:57  <Bosmon> What kinds of causes did you seem to find for the stability problems?
2019-03-04T15:01:15  <jhernandez> in fact, I think that we should have a quick call on it
2019-03-04T15:01:57  <stegru> I think it was due to the windows firewall prompt.. but also a few other things, such as the service incorrectly thinking gpii had crashed
2019-03-04T15:02:23  <jhernandez> there were several problems, like the firwall thing as stegru said
2019-03-04T15:02:52  <Bosmon> Was there another cause of it thinking GPII had crashed in addition to the firewall prompt?
2019-03-04T15:02:55  <stegru> i'm not confident with that, because you, javi, didn't get that prompt

2019-03-04T15:03:52  <jhernandez> stegru: yes, but it's true that I sometimes install and the firewall rule is already there (because I already installed another version of morphic)
2019-03-04T15:03:56  <stegru> well, the service sends a ping every 20 seconds - I think that wasn't long enough for during the startup
2019-03-04T15:04:49  <jhernandez> we are also suffering from a) task tray not appearing and b) morphic becomes unresponsive - but none of them are caused by the service at all
2019-03-04T15:05:23  <stegru> oh yes, that
2019-03-04T15:05:26  <Bosmon> ok
2019-03-04T15:05:57  <stegru> you said killiing the taskbutton process made it work, jhernandez ?
2019-03-04T15:06:09  <jhernandez> yes

2019-03-04T15:06:27  <jhernandez> a or b?
2019-03-04T15:06:29  <stegru> a

2019-03-04T15:06:34  <jhernandez> a
2019-03-04T15:06:43  <stegru> oh, you mean the whole task tray?
2019-03-04T15:07:55  <jhernandez> in fact it's the whole tray thing since we were also experiencing these problems before
2019-03-04T15:08:54  <stegru> i'm tired of this now
2019-03-04T15:09:05  <jhernandez> of what

2019-03-04T20:31:35  <sgithens> and it does have somethign to do with it attaching extra bits to the payload or get method signature
2019-03-04T20:31:59  <sgithens> also, if you havne't read them yet, the general documenation for how settings handlers work is good
2019-03-04T20:32:12  <sgithens> I can't remember if that's on the old wiki or in md readme's now
2019-03-04T20:32:25  <bryan_> Yeah that was my hunch that the path was missing from the payload but there is still more breaking it
2019-03-04T20:32:44  <bryan_> I'll dig up the docs too
