2019-12-13T14:32:52  <Bosmon> Hi there the-t-in-rtf - christop_ has created a new repo at https://github.com/GPII/gpii-no-os
2019-12-13T14:32:59  <Bosmon> Do we recall the steps necessary to enlist this in CI?
2019-12-13T14:34:04  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@c-73-107-162-68.hsd1.fl.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: colinclark)
2019-12-13T14:35:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I do, just a moment while I orient myself to what he already has.
2019-12-13T14:36:15  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, that didn't take long.
2019-12-13T14:36:56  <the-t-in-rtf> So, in all my recent work I have been starting with repos that already had a working means of setting up a Vagrant VM for testing.
2019-12-13T14:37:26  <the-t-in-rtf> And then it's a matter of creating a job for the project in the (GPII) ci-service repo
2019-12-13T14:37:58  <the-t-in-rtf> In all recent work I have used Alfredo's Vagrant CI plugin and a .vagrant.yml file in each repo.
2019-12-13T14:38:07  <the-t-in-rtf> just a second and I will provide a pair of links
2019-12-13T14:38:49  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars
2019-12-13T14:38:56  <the-t-in-rtf> That project has the .vagrant.yml file
2019-12-13T14:39:28  <the-t-in-rtf> And here is the corresponding Jenkins job definition:
2019-12-13T14:39:29  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/gpii-handlebars.yml
2019-12-13T14:40:52  <the-t-in-rtf> And here are the docs for installing the Vagrant CI plugin for local testing: https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci/tree/NOJIRA-review
2019-12-13T14:41:23  <the-t-in-rtf> so, get a working config file that can be used with "vagrant up && vagrant ci test", then create a pull against ci-service to add the project to CI.

2019-12-13T14:51:23  <the-t-in-rtf> we will have to eventually discuss how to handle his direct work, probably we'd have no choice but to use another type of CI
2019-12-13T14:51:35  <the-t-in-rtf> but for his "no os" work, that should be adequate
2019-12-13T14:52:16  <Bosmon> Awesome, I've directed him to your instructions on his pull https://github.com/GPII/gpii-no-os/pull/1

2019-12-13T18:48:28  <sgithens> cindyli or anyone. Do you know if there is a flag to our `test:browser` with the embedded testem or whatever to *not* close the browser window when they are done?
2019-12-13T18:49:23  <cindyli> sgithens: i don't know such as flag
2019-12-13T18:50:00  <sgithens> it's interesting that the terminal output doesn't serialize the comparison objects
2019-12-13T18:50:09  <cindyli> sgithens: if you are fixing the browser tests in your pull request for fixing spiSettingsHandler, the same failure can be reproduced locally
2019-12-13T18:50:20  <sgithens> ( I've been in the bad habit of not running the locally browser tests :p )
2019-12-13T18:50:27  <sgithens> yeah
2019-12-13T18:50:41  <sgithens> not ok 3 Firefox 71.0 - [41833 ms] - Composition #1: /gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/test/html/LifecycleManagerTest.html

2019-12-13T18:51:05  <sgithens> I'll just ctrl-\ the tests right before they finish
2019-12-13T18:51:36  <cindyli> running in local browser will be much easier to see the diff btw the actual and the expected
2019-12-13T18:51:47  *** avtar <avtar!~avtar@205.211.168.105> has joined #fluid-work
2019-12-13T18:51:53  <cindyli> it's all about "supportSettings" block that are not censored anymore
2019-12-13T18:52:02  <sgithens> oh, you mean not running it from `npm run test:browser`?
2019-12-13T18:52:26  <sgithens> Can I just the load the file from it's path manually and it will work?
2019-12-13T18:52:39  <cindyli> ya, i mean if you have a local web server hosting universal, just run that single LifecycleManagerTest.html in a local browser
2019-12-13T18:52:58  <sgithens> oh ok
2019-12-13T18:53:07  <sgithens> that makes sense
2019-12-13T18:53:26  <sgithens> I vaguely remember doing that in the past
2019-12-13T18:53:26  <cindyli> never tried without a web server, but if there's no resource loading involved, it might work too
2019-12-13T18:54:09  <sgithens> I should remember to ask atkins though if there is an option to not close the browser windows
2019-12-13T18:54:19  <sgithens> I don't see anything immediately in the list of testem options
2019-12-13T18:54:24  <sgithens> it would be cool
2019-12-13T18:54:25  <cindyli> ya, let me know too if you figured out
2019-12-13T18:54:41  <cindyli> would be very useful

2019-12-13T20:37:37  <Teddy> @michelled, @greatislander Looks like I do not have permission to push to this repo
2019-12-13T20:37:48  <Teddy> do you know who I will get in contact for this?
2019-12-13T20:39:35  <michelled> Teddy: we generally do a two step process - you would fork the repo into your personal space, make what ever changes you want and then make a pull request
2019-12-13T20:39:46  <michelled> then someone else would review the pull request and merge it
2019-12-13T20:39:58  <Teddy> Oh right!
2019-12-13T20:40:02  <Teddy> thank you
2019-12-13T20:40:09  <michelled> np!
2019-12-13T20:40:38  <michelled> for the time being, justin, greatislander and I will be reviewing for you so just ping us and we can decide between ourselves who'll take it on
