2018-11-12T11:02:06  <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon, regarding GPII-3527 (failed to run tests) this looks really strange. The `test:noCoverage` script doesn’t use the `instrumented` folder at all… Is it possible that the `src` folder is missing in the root folder of the gpii-app?
2018-11-12T11:25:33  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes sorry, the fault was caused by some silly working copy corruption
2018-11-12T11:25:37  <Bosmon> I've closed the issue
2018-11-12T11:26:35  <dandimitrov> Great, thanks
2018-11-12T11:32:57  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m]
2018-11-12T11:32:58  <the-t-in-rtf> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vhhzs0pLCYPyLDPXpWNVUrwVvTv8IoGhRHsUUiA7gJk/edit?usp=sharing
2018-11-12T11:33:14  <the-t-in-rtf> Which rows in the spreadsheet does "additional keyboard features" relate to?
2018-11-12T11:33:14  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3139
2018-11-12T11:34:13  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, where on that list do the personalization pulls fit in?
2018-11-12T11:34:18  <the-t-in-rtf> (the spreadsheet, I mean)_
2018-11-12T11:34:45  <the-t-in-rtf> Same for "mouse additional features"
2018-11-12T11:35:07  <the-t-in-rtf> and "touchpad sensitivity"
2018-11-12T11:35:13  <javjarfer[m]> Hi! the-t-in-rtf , you mean the rows from the All Waves?
2018-11-12T11:35:23  <the-t-in-rtf> "master status and priorities"
2018-11-12T11:35:35  <javjarfer[m]> it's the issue description https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3139, "from row 78 to 85 from the Onboarding status sheet"
2018-11-12T11:36:16  <javjarfer[m]> I don't know if that settings were added to the "master status and priorities"
2018-11-12T11:36:33  <javjarfer[m]> I haven't added any rows to that document
2018-11-12T11:36:39  <the-t-in-rtf> "onboarding status sheet" to me means the first tab
2018-11-12T11:36:49  <the-t-in-rtf> but yes, there's a disconnect, which is why I was asking
2018-11-12T11:37:19  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I should be able to flag your work in the first "master" tab as being in progress or in a pull request.
2018-11-12T11:37:50  <javjarfer[m]> Maybe they belong to row 17, "Windows 10 - All accessibility related features"
2018-11-12T11:38:26  <the-t-in-rtf> but there's also entries for mousekeys, stickykeys, etc
2018-11-12T11:38:28  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: that's true, but I think that as you said, there are no links between the two documents
2018-11-12T11:38:35  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, it's a bit of a mess
2018-11-12T11:38:47  <the-t-in-rtf> glad we talked though, now I know to look in  both
2018-11-12T11:49:24  <jhernandez> Bosmon: ohh, QSS1.1 is in master!
2018-11-12T11:49:41  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: congrats!!!

2018-11-12T13:31:26  <dandimitrov> Bosmon, sorry to bother you again, but we were thinking on starting work on the https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2653
2018-11-12T13:31:27  <dandimitrov> Wanted to check whether the provided approach is still valid :?
2018-11-12T13:39:42  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: I’ve also created an issue for gpii-app’s occasional test failures - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3528

2018-11-12T15:27:33  <cindyli> Bosmon: when you have a chance, can you review my two pull requests:
2018-11-12T15:27:34  <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/706
2018-11-12T15:27:38  <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/708
2018-11-12T15:28:29  <cindyli> Going thru my todo list for the next work, these 2 seem to have relatively higher priority:
2018-11-12T15:28:37  <cindyli> GPII-3318 - Implement a snapshotter to provide initial setting values to QSS
2018-11-12T15:28:37  <cindyli> GPII-3424 - Eliminate the possibility for more than one active session to be keyed in GPII
2018-11-12T15:29:45  <cindyli> is the snapshotter still high priority? if not, shall I do the bug fix of GPII-3424
2018-11-12T15:38:05  <cindyli> working on GPII-3424 for now
2018-11-12T15:39:30  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think the snapshotter has gone off the boil
2018-11-12T15:39:35  <Bosmon> 3424 is good
2018-11-12T15:40:05  <Bosmon> It would be great if you had a time for a quick look at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3396 as well
2018-11-12T15:44:33  <cindyli> ok
