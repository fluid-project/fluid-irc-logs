2020-04-27T12:10:18  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I'm going through e-mails right now. I see you are looking into GitHub Actions and some things with Testem. Another thing to be aware of us that I've had issues using Testem with the Safari 13. See https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/1387
2020-04-27T12:11:00  <gtirloni> ah, interesting!
2020-04-27T12:11:10  <Justin_o> Safari isn't something we currently support in CI with Jenkins, but it would be nice if we could get it running with GitHub Actions at some point. Although I'm not sure what we could do about this.
2020-04-27T12:31:40  <chaitanya> Justin_o: Thank you for merging my PR the other day.
