2018-10-22T11:51:04  <dandimitrov> Could you take a look at my progress on coverage report for the renderer processes?
2018-10-22T11:51:16  <dandimitrov> Here’s a PR: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/51
2018-10-22T11:51:22  <the-t-in-rtf1> sure
2018-10-22T11:51:48  <dandimitrov> I’ve included descriptions with the basic idea of the approach
2018-10-22T11:52:48  <dandimitrov> If you have some problem with github use: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/51/files to see the diff
2018-10-22T11:53:51  <dandimitrov> Something strange is happening with gihub there all morning…
2018-10-22T11:55:38  <the-t-in-rtf1> well, it'll be a bit before I'm there
2018-10-22T11:55:51  <the-t-in-rtf1> I have to provision a Windows VM before I can even run npm install against your work... :)
2018-10-22T11:56:33  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: I was wondering whether you can take a look at the code
2018-10-22T11:56:52  <the-t-in-rtf1> Sure, but I also want to look at the report.
2018-10-22T11:56:55  <dandimitrov> I’m still having trouble with stability (it hangs sometimes)
2018-10-22T11:57:08  <the-t-in-rtf1> if you wanted to save some time, I often put reports on my github pages site.
2018-10-22T11:57:39  <the-t-in-rtf1> that way I can look at completeness while I'm looking at your settings, etc.
2018-10-22T11:59:26  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: ok then, I’ll generate one and include it in the branch
2018-10-22T12:00:05  <the-t-in-rtf1> cool
2018-10-22T12:00:11  <the-t-in-rtf1> why did you have to fork the coverage sender?
2018-10-22T12:00:31  <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, it should have worked with the right options passed to the client-serving middleware?
2018-10-22T12:00:48  <the-t-in-rtf1> I can comment on the pull as to what options you'd need, but wanted to know if you tried it.

2018-10-22T12:04:13  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: I’ve included the report as well
2018-10-22T12:05:19  <the-t-in-rtf1> I see it.
2018-10-22T12:05:59  <dandimitrov> from what I understood the coverage sender hooks to the qunit in the BrowserWindow, but we don’t have it there
2018-10-22T12:17:01  <the-t-in-rtf1> interesting, what are your tests written in, then?
2018-10-22T12:19:11  <dandimitrov> I was thinking of collecting coverage on the basis of the tests in the main process
2018-10-22T12:24:29  <the-t-in-rtf1> so, right now the "afterCallback" that sends the data is only designed to hook into Testem or QUnit, but if that's the only reason you use it, I could update the bit that creates the coverage sender to expose a function you could use to trigger the sending.
2018-10-22T12:24:54  <the-t-in-rtf1> trying to see if we can avoid your having to figure out the IPC stuff and write a new client.
2018-10-22T12:25:09  <the-t-in-rtf1> just figuring out the IPC stuff will be headache enough.
2018-10-22T12:25:50  <the-t-in-rtf1> if the coverage sending function was available, could you just trigger that from the master process?
2018-10-22T12:26:07  <dandimitrov> that sound reasonable
2018-10-22T12:26:42  <dandimitrov> yes, sending function with a callback argument

2018-10-22T12:28:50  <the-t-in-rtf1> I can probably have it stash the callback in its existing namespace

2018-10-22T12:29:10  <the-t-in-rtf1> so that way you're not having to assign variables and I don't have to return anything.
2018-10-22T12:36:00  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: hmm, adding an options arg and binding it in the current usages might be enough :?
2018-10-22T12:37:21  <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, something like options.exposeCallback?
2018-10-22T12:43:49  <Bosmon> Hi there the-t-in-rtf1 - it looks like our CI has gone mad and is rebuilding the same jobs endlessly?
2018-10-22T12:44:15  <the-t-in-rtf1> sorry to hear it.
2018-10-22T12:44:40  <the-t-in-rtf1> if you can give an example I can confirm whether I have any access to help (likely not)
2018-10-22T12:45:09  <the-t-in-rtf1> I had escalated powers for various proof-of-concept setups, but not really for the main builds.
2018-10-22T12:45:25  <the-t-in-rtf1> @dandimitrov https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3467
2018-10-22T12:45:37  <the-t-in-rtf1> I've already actually done the work, it'll take a few minutes to write the tests.
2018-10-22T12:46:20  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pull-request/
2018-10-22T12:48:01  <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, @Bosmon, I can disable the jobs, apparently.
2018-10-22T12:48:09  <the-t-in-rtf1> should I kill the ones waiting?
2018-10-22T12:48:13  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - please
2018-10-22T12:48:43  <the-t-in-rtf1> should I leave 103 running?
2018-10-22T12:48:59  <the-t-in-rtf1> does it serve a purpose, or is it retesting something we already know is good or bad?
2018-10-22T12:49:34  <the-t-in-rtf1> (the others are already dead)
2018-10-22T12:51:41  <the-t-in-rtf1> argh, the github outage is making it hard to actually look at the PR itself.
2018-10-22T12:52:03  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - it passed many times in the past
2018-10-22T12:52:17  <Bosmon> It was only ever a minor update to move our CI to node 10.x
2018-10-22T12:52:58  <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, that one is gone as well.
2018-10-22T12:53:03  <the-t-in-rtf1> I don't see it triggering new ones
2018-10-22T12:55:50  <Bosmon> phew
2018-10-22T12:55:52  <Bosmon> Thanks for that
2018-10-22T13:01:41  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - looks like it is continuing to endlessly trigger new jobs
2018-10-22T13:02:55  <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, I see that.
2018-10-22T13:03:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o - who is in charge of the IDRC CI these days?
2018-10-22T13:03:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: Alan is, but he's away today
2018-10-22T13:03:29  <Bosmon> Justin_o - oops
2018-10-22T13:03:31  <the-t-in-rtf1> I can disable it for the day.
2018-10-22T13:03:36  <the-t-in-rtf1> but I know that's not handy.
2018-10-22T13:06:00  <Bosmon> Actually it seems to be a global phenomenon
2018-10-22T13:06:05  <Bosmon> I think GPII pulls are rebuilding endlessly too
2018-10-22T13:06:17  <Bosmon> Look at https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/153#issuecomment-431829246
2018-10-22T13:06:37  <Bosmon> We've had a build every 15 minutes for the last 3 hours
2018-10-22T13:07:03  <Justin_o> the robots are taking over
2018-10-22T13:07:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: i wonder if it's related to the github issues.. maybe they are sending the web hook continuously
2018-10-22T13:09:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: looking at the recent deliveries for infusion's web hook there were quite a few sent recently.. So i'm thinking it may be an issue from the GitHub side.

2018-10-22T14:05:13  <the-t-in-rtf1> the tests should be much more instructive this time, they use the same options you'll need to when configuring the middleware that serves up the client.
