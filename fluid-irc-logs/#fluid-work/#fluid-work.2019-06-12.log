2019-06-12T08:58:46  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru and @bosmon, I am investigating some stuff on my own with win32.json, we don't need to meet today.
2019-06-12T08:58:54  <the-t-in-rtf> we have a similar meeting tomorrow anyway.
2019-06-12T09:13:09  <stegru> ok the-t-in-rtf
2019-06-12T09:13:35  <the-t-in-rtf> I answered my own rhetorical question, most of the options in win32.json that mimick the defaults can be safely removed.
2019-06-12T09:14:36  <the-t-in-rtf> It's "only" 111 lines out of 15501, but the less cruft we drag around, the better
2019-06-12T09:17:26  <the-t-in-rtf> we'll lose more from proper inheritance, about 240 lines just from inheriting the OS context stuff alone
2019-06-12T09:18:30  <the-t-in-rtf> 120 or so from making a grade for "always installed" solutions, etc.

2019-06-12T13:58:54  <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, I'm looking forward to the SR changes you're doing - will the solutions be put into their own files?
2019-06-12T14:03:15  <the-t-in-rtf> many solutions and their settings will be split apart into files.
2019-06-12T14:04:04  <the-t-in-rtf> but there's no hard requirement that each file only describe one setting
2019-06-12T14:04:12  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. we can group them together if it makes things more readable
2019-06-12T14:05:03  <stegru> well, that sounds interesting

2019-06-12T16:47:39  <sgithens> Bosmon: Is there a reason logLevelStack is private, or at least why we don't have a way to fetch the current level, other than testing a bunch of values with passLogLevel?

2019-06-12T17:14:27  <Bosmon> sgithens - well, this thinking stems from the days when one had "APIs"
2019-06-12T17:14:49  <Bosmon> In which the API would ordinarily state, "The only purpose a user might wish to examine the logging level would be to determine whether something should be logged"
2019-06-12T17:15:04  <Bosmon> Do you have a reason to examine the logging level other than to determine whether something should be logged? : P
