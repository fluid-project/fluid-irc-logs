2018-09-21T21:11:58  <gmoss> Bosmon: I think the issue I'm experiencing with my tests in FLUID-6300 may be due to my aggregate event upon which I am waiting to fire my tests. One of its sub-events, onSlidingPanelUpdated, will fire the first time UIO is loaded, which means that when onUioPanelsUpdated is fired after the first language change, the aggregate event will fire prematurely and trigger the tests before the change has actually finished
2018-09-21T21:12:06  <gmoss> in case you were still thinking about that issue :)
2018-09-21T21:12:34  <Bosmon> gmoss - that's pretty interesting
2018-09-21T21:12:43  <Bosmon> But I'm not sure I remember that there was an existing issue with aggregate events
2018-09-21T21:13:00  <gmoss> I don't think it's misbehaving, it's more that I've set it up in an unwise fashion
2018-09-21T21:13:55  <clown> fluid-bot: bye, and have a nice weekend

2018-09-21T21:14:49  <Bosmon> Wow, so quick
2018-09-21T21:15:46  <Bosmon> gmoss - what should be the signal that the change has actually finished?
2018-09-21T21:17:29  <gmoss> for the slidingPanel component, it's one of the two possible events that fire after its refreshView function has happened. I have listeners on those which escalate to onSlidingPanelUpdated. for the other panels, I have a listener that fires "last" in a sequence which includes a call to fluid.prefs.separatedPanel.updateView. this seems to work as intended, when examining the timing
2018-09-21T21:17:54  <gmoss> but if, as I suspect, the initial firing of onSlidingPanelUpdated is making the aggregate event fire too soon, things will get tripped up
2018-09-21T21:18:49  <gmoss> I'm just trying to think of a way to "ignore" onSlidingPanelUpdated when it shouldn't apply, or if that even makes sense
2018-09-21T21:20:58  <gmoss> is there a way to "reset" an aggregate event's counting?
2018-09-21T21:21:17  <gmoss> a jedi mind trick to say "you haven't heard this event fire yet"
2018-09-21T21:25:14  <Bosmon> gmoss - unfortunately not
2018-09-21T21:25:18  <gmoss> Bosmon: :(
2018-09-21T21:25:19  <Bosmon> I suggest you make a further event
2018-09-21T21:27:12  <gmoss> Bosmon: I've started to go down this road a couple of times, Justin_o suggested it as well, but I got stuck at the point where  I'm adding it to the list of the aggregate event. When should it fire? what will keep it from triggering the aggregate event the next time, since onSlidingPanelUpdated will still be counted early?
2018-09-21T21:27:31  <gmoss> I think I've been looking at this far too long haha

2018-09-21T21:28:31  <Bosmon> gmoss - you just need to fire a further event at the time when the update corresponds to an update you are going to be interested in ....
2018-09-21T21:28:44  <sgithens> fluid-bot: shuffle step shuffle step
2018-09-21T21:28:44  <fluid-bot> sgithens: shuffle step step
2018-09-21T21:28:58  <sgithens> nice fluid-bot!
2018-09-21T21:30:48  <gmoss> Bosmon: at the risk of seeming obtuse, how does this differ from the update event that I'm already listening for?
2018-09-21T21:31:41  <Bosmon> gmoss - well, someone must know that it is the right one :)
2018-09-21T21:31:54  <Bosmon> So tell me what are the components of this aggregate event?
2018-09-21T21:31:55  <gmoss> i.e. if I have "afterPanelHide.slidingPanelUpdated": "{fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor.localized}.events.onSlidingPanelUpdated", which listens to the event for that component that I'm interested in, how do I fire an event at that time in a way that is materially different from what is already happening?

2018-09-21T21:34:06  <michelled> sgithens: I support teaching fluid-bot to dance
2018-09-21T21:34:19  <Bosmon> OK, and what is the situation which leads to this "false dawn"?
2018-09-21T21:34:24  <sgithens> :)
2018-09-21T21:36:27  <gmoss> Bosmon: I thought I had a good handle on the answer to your question, but it has given me pause
2018-09-21T21:39:31  <gmoss> I thought "the individual UIO panels weren't created until the language has changed", but this is not true. the prefsEditor component of prefsEditorLoader waits for templatesAndIframeReady before being created, so perhaps that's part of the answer
2018-09-21T21:39:49  <gmoss> there are many moving parts
2018-09-21T21:41:57  <gmoss> I think I'm all out of brain juice for the day. Bosmon as always I appreciate your assistance
2018-09-21T21:42:06  <Bosmon> Sorry I haven't given much yet
2018-09-21T21:42:18  <gmoss> you have indeed
2018-09-21T21:42:28  <gmoss> the socratic questioning is useful

2018-09-21T21:44:05  <gmoss> Bosmon: hah, perfect
2018-09-21T21:44:58  <gmoss> with that I'm signing off for now (I'm present in the channel 24/7, but usually not working off-hours)
2018-09-21T21:45:05  <gmoss> thanks again!
2018-09-21T21:45:14  <Bosmon> OK, sorry it's so complex
2018-09-21T21:45:22  <Bosmon> I promise it will go away eventually : P
2018-09-21T21:45:45  <gmoss> hahaha no worries. I think my relative lack of understanding of the system has contributed, not only the nature of the system
2018-09-21T21:46:17  <Bosmon> Well, it should just work
2018-09-21T21:46:25  <Bosmon> Without any of this nonsensical "recreating panels" etc.
