2018-12-20T09:29:10  <dandimitrov> Hey, stegru, I’m looking at GPII-3597. From what we've seen in Electron, once a BrowserWindow is hidden its DOM is frozen. From testing it locally it seems to me that when the waitDialog is hidden there's no CPU load coming from :/
2018-12-20T09:30:40  <dandimitrov> Probably the spinner animation gets frozen utill re-showing the its BrowerWindow

2018-12-20T13:05:19  <stegru> hi dandimitrov, that explains why I only had high CPU usage before I made the spinner show - after it was displayed, CPU was low. So, it looks like it freezes only after it's hidden - but not when it's initially hidden
2018-12-20T13:06:37  <stegru> I've made a quick fix in https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/76, but I might make it be initially not-animated until it's shown
2018-12-20T13:08:37  <dandimitrov> Hmm, strange, let me give it a try again
2018-12-20T13:09:26  <stegru> the cpu usage isn't instant, it takes a few minutes to increase
2018-12-20T13:09:41  <stegru> this is probably a chromium bug
2018-12-20T13:11:19  <stegru> 5 minutes: https://i.imgur.com/zoDBexv.png
2018-12-20T13:12:03  <stegru> and the gap in this one is where I disabled the image in chrome inspector: https://i.imgur.com/Jsp1UjE.png
2018-12-20T13:12:45  <stegru> I didn't touch the QSS

2018-12-20T14:25:54  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: stegru (and to anyone using the win vagrant box)
2018-12-20T14:27:00  <jhernandez> did you miss your installed languages pack after a recent windows update?
2018-12-20T14:27:47  <jhernandez> just happened to me and Gregg has just experienced the same with his windows vm
2018-12-20T14:27:51  <jhernandez> just curious
2018-12-20T14:33:14  <jhernandez> this is the last one my vm received https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4471324/windows-10-update-kb4471324
2018-12-20T14:38:01  <dandimitrov> jhernandez, meaning that there were no languages listed in the language setting in the QS :?
2018-12-20T14:38:54  <jhernandez> in the OS
2018-12-20T14:38:59  <jhernandez> :)
2018-12-20T14:39:24  <jhernandez> so yeah, the QS displays whatever is available at OS level, which is fine
2018-12-20T14:39:49  <dandimitrov> hmm, no I haven’t but I’m still using the old VM
2018-12-20T14:41:20  <jhernandez> I stumbled upon this https://thinksmartbox.com/answer/languages-reset-windows-10-anniversary-update/ so I wouldn't be surprised if that is happening again
2018-12-20T14:41:57  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: is your vm up to date on Windows Updates?
2018-12-20T14:43:23  <dandimitrov> yep, I think it is
2018-12-20T14:43:29  <dandimitrov> I haven’t disabled it
2018-12-20T14:43:40  <jhernandez> and you had installed languages and they're still there, right?
2018-12-20T14:43:43  <jhernandez> okay okay
2018-12-20T14:44:08  <dandimitrov> looks like a new update is on the way - KB4483234 - I’ll install it and see what happens
2018-12-20T14:49:03  <stegru> can't they get anything right?
2018-12-20T14:51:52  <dandimitrov> jhernandez: with the latest update I have all the installed languages listed. One thing to note is that the OS language that was set when installing the update was not English (not Bulgarian)
