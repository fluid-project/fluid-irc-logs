2019-09-09T13:44:00  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I'm updating the copyrights for UIO+. It looks like you put some in before as RtF-US is that correct, or should it have been RtF-International?

2019-09-09T13:50:19  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks, I'll just leave it as that
2019-09-09T13:50:42  <jhernandez> but I don't see any problem in updating it to be RtF-International

2019-09-09T15:02:03  <Justin_o> alanharnum: I was just talking to bosmon about prefs framework refactoring. Do you think you could give a description of some of the issues/difficulties/challenges/etc. you've been running into while setting up instances of UIO/Prefs Framework. You can add it to this pad we are using. https://pad.gpii.net/p/uio-and-prefs-framework-requirements-2u194n92
2019-09-09T15:03:36  <alanharnum> Justin_o: Yes, I'll put in some comments.
2019-09-09T15:03:44  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks :)
2019-09-09T15:21:12  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks for the writeup, are you able to share a link to your code?
2019-09-09T15:22:46  <alanharnum> Justin_o: I dropped a link into the pad

2019-09-09T16:15:16  <gmoss> cindyli: Justin_o and I are reviewing some accessibility issues with the Storytelling Tool and planning our work to address them. Would you be able to provide review for our work when the time comes? it's relatively urgent since the tool will be used on the 12th
2019-09-09T16:21:37  <cindyli> sure, gmoss
2019-09-09T16:23:50  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks! we'll let you know when we have something :)

2019-09-09T16:50:19  <gmoss> cindyli: I've created an Epic Jira to capture this work, we'll be filing a PR under that

2019-09-09T17:54:33  <Justin_o> gmoss: so trying to update to latest infusion. The server tests passed. Running the browser tests, the first error is from the Story Page tests, which don't run because Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
2019-09-09T17:54:52  <Justin_o> which I guess is probably an error with a template or message bundle.. I'm thinking a template
2019-09-09T17:54:57  <Justin_o> is that what you were expecting?
2019-09-09T17:55:03  <gmoss> Justin_o: that may be the SJRK-255 bug rearing its head
2019-09-09T17:55:23  <gmoss> Justin_o: if you can wait a few minutes, I can take a look
2019-09-09T17:55:33  <Justin_o> sure thanks

2019-09-09T21:00:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks.. I tried in a few browsers and it seemed to work. I also tried an image which looked like it uploaded fine too. It would be good to ensure that things behave as you expect though. I might not be realizing something.
2019-09-09T21:01:54  <sgithens> stegru: the-t-in-rtf did mean me last friday about the JAWS stuff. I'll catch up with him in the morning
