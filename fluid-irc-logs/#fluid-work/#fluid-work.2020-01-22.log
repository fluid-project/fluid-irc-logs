2020-01-22T15:23:33  <Shubham> Thank you @gmoss
2020-01-22T15:24:10  <gmoss> You're welcome, Shubham, best of luck!

2020-01-22T17:10:48  <Justin_o> I don't think it's changed
2020-01-22T17:10:55  <Justin_o> at least not the dev release
2020-01-22T17:11:11  <gmoss> since 2019-12-20?
2020-01-22T17:11:20  <Justin_o> I believe so
2020-01-22T17:11:43  <gmoss> i'm still running the 2019-12-19, but I have made some minor changes to the tool since the last time I tried 12-20
2020-01-22T17:11:56  <gmoss> Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to try
2020-01-22T17:12:25  <Justin_o> I used this release 3.0.0-dev.20191220T163226Z.db83ce0ef.FLUID-6145
2020-01-22T17:13:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's the one that had failed for me. pending confirmation :)
2020-01-22T17:13:37  <Justin_o> I had to make some changes to get things all working
2020-01-22T17:14:12  <Justin_o> but I was updating from an FLUID-6148 and having tested in the past with an older version of FLUID-61145
2020-01-22T17:14:14  <Justin_o> 6145
2020-01-22T17:15:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: hmm.. what changes did you make? I just tried again and it's still broken, it crashes trying to start Kettle or running the node server tests
2020-01-22T17:15:59  <gmoss> maybe it's a matter of updating my kettle version
2020-01-22T17:16:09  <Justin_o> gmoss: could be, I don't use kettle

2020-01-22T17:16:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, I'd give that a shot

2020-01-22T17:18:57  <Justin_o> also we should chat later about GSoC admin stuff

2020-01-22T17:39:56  <gmoss> other than the occasional kettle crash of course, which persists (I will file a Jira for that today, it's about time)

2020-01-22T17:58:16  <Justin_o> jhung: simonjb mentioned this as another option for the infusion-docs if we change technologies https://docusaurus.iohttps://docusaurus.io
2020-01-22T17:58:36  <Justin_o> it's actually interesting because it seems to handle versioning of documentation. not sure how though
2020-01-22T18:01:21  <javjarfer[m]> Hi the-t-in-rtf , sorry, Sandra pinged telling me that the validation work for allowing "Application specific terms" in preference sets is done, is that true? was that work contained in your last validation pull?
2020-01-22T18:01:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm going offline very soon, we should probably talk tomorrow.
2020-01-22T18:02:04  <the-t-in-rtf> but
2020-01-22T18:02:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I did nothing to make it more or less possiible to use settings (application specific) vs. preferences (possibly generic)
2020-01-22T18:03:01  <the-t-in-rtf> I just added rules to validate what the system currently can handle
2020-01-22T18:04:09  <the-t-in-rtf> there is also some earlier work to make a combined "codex" of both common terms and solutiions-related settings
2020-01-22T18:04:17  <the-t-in-rtf> but that's been in for a while
2020-01-22T18:04:18  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: Okay, I understand so there is no support for renamed settings in preferences set yet true?
2020-01-22T18:04:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I wouldn't be the person to ask, but I assume not
2020-01-22T18:04:45  <the-t-in-rtf> well, I MIGHT be the person to ask
2020-01-22T18:04:56  <the-t-in-rtf> if we assume that I'd have to fix that as part of the upcoming Live Solutions Registry work
2020-01-22T18:05:13  <the-t-in-rtf> ditto for representing versions and bunches of other stuff
2020-01-22T18:05:38  <the-t-in-rtf> but you need to be very careful about calling that applicaiton specific settinigs
2020-01-22T18:05:43  <the-t-in-rtf> that has a specific meaning with a long history
2020-01-22T18:06:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume what you mean is transforms between the setting as it needs to be read/written by the settings handler and some "alias"
2020-01-22T18:07:18  <the-t-in-rtf> if that's what you mean by renamed, then I'm aware of that issue
2020-01-22T18:07:22  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, I understand, we have been calling those transforms "application specific terms" since it's the only way to introduce logic that represent dependencies between the settings
2020-01-22T18:07:50  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I have to take over my son and set my wife free for her own meeting
2020-01-22T18:08:02  <the-t-in-rtf> If it's not clear in the morning, you and I are working the same hours, plenty of time to talk
2020-01-22T18:08:15  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: have a nice evening
2020-01-22T18:08:19  <javjarfer[m]> talk you tomorrow
2020-01-22T18:08:28  <the-t-in-rtf> we need to find a new name, then, as Gregg also uses "application specific terms" for the settings themselves
2020-01-22T18:08:43  <the-t-in-rtf> application generic sounds nice to me
2020-01-22T18:08:56  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes... I'm aware of that too, it's really confusing
2020-01-22T18:09:12  <javjarfer[m]> having the 3 meanings in the same terms
2020-01-22T18:09:35  <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe the aliases will become what we think of as the application specific terms and we'll then have "settings handler terms" or something like that
2020-01-22T18:09:47  <the-t-in-rtf> we should have another meeting say next Tuesday

2020-01-22T18:10:41  <javjarfer[m]> maybe should call the alias, simply "alias" the new generated endpoints with logic, like the one for the "color vision filters", "application specific terms" and if it's something that covers multiple settings from the same application "application generic term" as you suggest

2020-01-22T18:20:44  <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o, regarding Docusaurus, I've not used it at all so we would need to do some investigation into its suitability (a11y and such). I think there are good reasons to standardise on Hugo as our static site generator. But wanted to mention this as it's potentially interesting as a documentation-specific site generator with some flexibility
2020-01-22T18:21:14  <simonjb> though certainly less flexibility than Hugo

2020-01-22T19:09:32  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
2020-01-22T19:10:21  <gmoss> Bosmon: fyi ^^^ hopefully that isn't a concern. this is so we can continue on from those changes and you'll be able to get back to it once you have time. I'm sure many people are currently waiting patiently for your attention :)

2020-01-22T21:16:39  <Justin_o> Teddy__: thanks for leading the community meeting today.
2020-01-22T21:19:24  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks for reviewing my new PR!
2020-01-22T21:19:42  <gmoss> re that error you found, is it possible that you're running an older version of some dependencies? did you do a fresh npm install?
2020-01-22T21:19:54  <gmoss> it looks like the error i was getting with the binder before the-t-in-rtf fixed it up
2020-01-22T21:20:11  <gmoss> (thanks again, Tony!)
2020-01-22T21:31:27  <Teddy__> np Justin_o enjoyed doing it :)
2020-01-22T21:32:12  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss. it was because I didn't do a fresh npm install

2020-01-22T21:33:25  <Justin_o> cindyli: which version of node are you running?
2020-01-22T21:33:27  <gmoss> Justin_o and I were trying to reproduce it just now :)

2020-01-22T21:34:01  <cindyli> node v8.13.0
2020-01-22T21:34:50  <cindyli> sure, gmoss
2020-01-22T21:35:40  <cindyli> another issue i had was, when running browser all-tests.html in chrome, the server constantly terminates with this error:
2020-01-22T21:35:41  <cindyli> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Error marking thread to request 8b1f7pgf-18821 which has already been destroyed
2020-01-22T21:35:41  <cindyli> Error: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Error marking thread to request 8b1f7pgf-18821 which has already been destroyed
2020-01-22T21:36:09  <cindyli> this is a known issue so I didn't mention it in the review
2020-01-22T21:39:06  <cindyli> but i don't think this termination appeared so often before at running tests. probably because the new chrome is fast enough that kettle requests are sent in shorter intervals

2020-01-22T21:48:26  <gmoss> cindyli: yeah I've been getting that a lot more lately! Like you said it's a known issue,  we've been aware of it since June last year when Justin_o and simonjb had tried to help me reproduce it, and I moved onto other work before I got to filing a Jira. It's reassuring to be aware it happens in non-windows hosted servers as well :) it does seem much more frequent as both browser and site performance increase, for
