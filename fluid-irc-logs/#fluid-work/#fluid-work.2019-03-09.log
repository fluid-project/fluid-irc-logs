2019-03-09T08:29:43  <kris_HA> Bosmon: Hey Bosmon, conflicts are resolved. I see one thing that I don't like. Now the Quick Folders and Screen Capture are with tabindex 0. The quick fix for this is to make it like fixtures/qssSettings.json.

2019-03-09T08:29:43  <kris_HA> What do you think?
2019-03-09T08:31:47  <Bosmon> kris_HA - sounds reasonable
2019-03-09T08:32:25  <kris_HA> Nice, in the same pull request?
2019-03-09T08:36:28  <Bosmon> yes
2019-03-09T09:09:05  <kris_HA> Bosmon: What position is good for screen capture, at the front or before more button. What do you think?
2019-03-09T09:27:50  <kris_HA> Bosmon: I need to go. Will send you an email with positions I think to set for buttons. Have a nice day!
