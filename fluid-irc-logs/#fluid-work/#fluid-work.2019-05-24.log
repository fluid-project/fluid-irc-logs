2019-05-24T15:59:41  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: you are welcome!!! thanks for that fast merges!
2019-05-24T16:00:45  <javjarfer[m]> also, sorry for the delay, I pretended it to be faster, but got into crossfire with other stuff
2019-05-24T16:00:55  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yeeee, congrats!!!!
2019-05-24T16:01:28  <Bosmon> And then we can even direct Tyler to withdraw his pinned version of universal and then retire to a safe distance : P

2019-05-24T17:06:57  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: haha well, that will be more good news, we are in a good time frame for testing and see what happens
2019-05-24T17:09:20  <javjarfer[m]> btw I have discovered that this code https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L486, is never reached, since "that.options.deviceReporters" is always undefined when function is called
2019-05-24T17:23:01  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that's pretty interesting - and also with respect to the pull request of cindyli that was just merged
2019-05-24T17:34:04  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i can take a look on this. is there a specific test that you expect this line to be reached. just wanna know how I can reproduce the problem
2019-05-24T17:40:04  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@205.211.168.101> has joined #fluid-work
2019-05-24T18:23:35  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli , i made the debugging while running the integration tests
2019-05-24T18:23:50  <javjarfer[m]> I supposed that it should be filled there
2019-05-24T18:27:05  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: my search shows only ""windows/windows-dynamicDeviceReporter-testSpec.js" and "linux/linux-dynamicDeviceReporter-testSpec.js" uses the mock "deviceReporterAware" grade. I assume you found "that.options.deviceReporters === undefined" in there. i will give a try later

2019-05-24T18:46:58  <javjarfer[m]> Sry, I will take a look again later, I was trying to take a look to that impl to complete the new one for actions
2019-05-24T18:59:26  <cindyli> ok. thanks, javjarfer[m]
2019-05-24T19:32:07  <javjarfer[m]> haha no, thanks you cindyli , you pointed me there the mistake
2019-05-24T20:07:32  <sgithens> Bosmon: Should listeners for fluid.promise.fireTransformEvents be namespaced the same as typical listeners? It seems like we don't namespace them in a number of places?
2019-05-24T20:09:38  <sgithens> and by that, I mean the top level key for the entire transform
2019-05-24T20:09:55  <sgithens> we do namespace some of the individual ones inside the array that goes with it
2019-05-24T20:12:03  <Bosmon> sgithens - they should be namespaced even more than typical listeners
2019-05-24T20:12:10  <Bosmon> Since their ordering is typically far more crucial
2019-05-24T20:12:23  <Bosmon> I don't believe that there are places where we don't namespace them
2019-05-24T20:12:32  <sgithens> cheers, that's what I though
2019-05-24T20:12:33  <sgithens> t
2019-05-24T20:12:37  <sgithens> in the preferencesService
2019-05-24T20:12:48  <sgithens> we have like `onCreatePreferences` and stuff
2019-05-24T20:13:10  <sgithens> I'm making the chains now for... Migrating Couch Docs!
2019-05-24T20:14:11  <Bosmon> sgithens - every one of those listeners is namespaced
2019-05-24T20:16:19  <sgithens> I mean the top level key that references a transform chain: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesService.js#L55
2019-05-24T20:16:40  <sgithens> `onCreatePreferences.shouldThisBeANamespace`: [{
2019-05-24T20:16:42  <sgithens> Bosmon
2019-05-24T20:17:16  <sgithens> so you could replace the entire chain
2019-05-24T20:26:05  <Bosmon> sgithens - that would be meaningless
2019-05-24T20:26:13  <Bosmon> if all the chain had the same namespace, it wouldn't be a chain
2019-05-24T20:26:28  <Bosmon> If you wrote what you had said there, every element would then be discarded except for the last one

2019-05-24T20:27:43  <Bosmon> The whole point of having namespaces is that there is exactly one listener with each namespace

2019-05-24T21:04:10  <sgithens> hmm, so does onCreatePreferences not show up as it's own event? Can you not `thing.events.onCreatePreferences.fire` it?
2019-05-24T21:04:43  <sgithens> I understand it's on ordering and aggregation of other events, but does it become it's own separate event?
2019-05-24T21:05:07  <sgithens> I guess I could set the debugger and look

2019-05-24T21:07:52  <sgithens> For instance, say you had another transform chain, that did strictly analytics and reporting, in general and not for a specific safe, and you wanted it to be `onCreatePreferences.reporting`: { priority: "after:prefsSafeConstruction" }
2019-05-24T21:08:12  <sgithens> then the first chain would be `onCreatePreferences:prefsSafeConstruction`
