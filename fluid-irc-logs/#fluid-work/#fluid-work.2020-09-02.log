2020-09-02T13:18:25  <Justin_o> michelled: hello, when would you like to schedule our UIO planning chat for? I should have time today and tomorrow for it.
2020-09-02T13:18:50  <michelled> will you be working this afternoon Justin_o?
2020-09-02T13:21:12  <Justin_o> michelled: yes, I plan to work this afternoon.
2020-09-02T13:21:23  <michelled> cool, how about 2:00?
2020-09-02T13:21:30  <Justin_o> sure sounds good
2020-09-02T13:38:21  <cindyli> Justin_o: are pull requests in fluid-project/uio-plus repo using "squash and merge" or "git merge —no-ff" to merge? it seems recent merges used the former and older merges used the latter?
2020-09-02T13:38:43  <Justin_o> cindyli: I think it depended on who did the merge
2020-09-02T13:38:59  <cindyli> ok. which way is proper, Justin_o?
2020-09-02T13:40:00  <Justin_o> cindyli: I had intended to do squash and merge in that repo, but I'm not really sure how much it matters right now. I'm still debating that. I think you can do whichever you feel more comfortable with.
2020-09-02T13:40:03  <Justin_o> thanks for checking though
2020-09-02T13:41:13  <cindyli> ok. thanks, Justin_o. i think i will use "git merge —no-ff" for now before you make the decision because the majority of pull requests were merged this way
2020-09-02T13:41:35  <Justin_o> that makes sense
2020-09-02T13:50:58  <cindyli> Justin_o: i don't have push access to fluid-project/uio-plus
2020-09-02T13:51:14  <Justin_o> cindyli: one second, I thought I fixed that this morning, but might have missed something
2020-09-02T13:51:34  <cindyli> ok. thanks
2020-09-02T13:51:55  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, should be working now
2020-09-02T13:52:16  <Justin_o> I added the repo to the maintainer team but forgot to update the permissions
2020-09-02T13:52:16  <cindyli> ya. works great. thanks
2020-09-02T13:52:34  <cindyli> your pull request has been merged
2020-09-02T13:53:05  <Justin_o> cindyli: excellent thanks :)
2020-09-02T16:42:06  <Teddy___> Justin_o when making comments for functions what would be the best data type to declare an DOM element parameter?
2020-09-02T16:42:22  <Teddy___> for example here: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/src/js/utils.js#L5-L9
2020-09-02T16:43:08  <Teddy___> is uses `@param {String}` because the parameter is of string type
2020-09-02T16:43:29  <Teddy___> I want to know what to enter in the `{}` if your parameter is a DOM element
2020-09-02T16:44:23  <Teddy___> when I use `Typeof`  on a DOM element it returns `"object"`
2020-09-02T16:44:48  <Teddy___> so I was thinking  `@param {Object}`
2020-09-02T17:27:22  <Justin_o> Teddy___: hi Teddy, it's better to be more specific if possible. I think for infusion we've used DOM Element or DOM Node.. let me see if I can find an example
2020-09-02T17:28:39  <Justin_o> Teddy___: in this case I used DomElement https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/orator/js/Orator.js#L1016
2020-09-02T17:28:57  <Justin_o> Teddy___: in this case I used DomNode https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/orator/js/Orator.js#L553
2020-09-02T17:29:48  <Justin_o> elements can have nodes so I believe I made a distinction here to denote what is expect.. so for example a <p> tag would correspond to an element but the text node inside would be a node
2020-09-02T17:29:54  <Justin_o> so it would depend on what you are using it for
2020-09-02T17:30:08  <Teddy___> I see, Thanks Justin_o
2020-09-02T17:30:24  <Justin_o> you could also setup a TypeDef to define whatever it is that you use https://jsdoc.app/tags-typedef.html
2020-09-02T17:30:52  <Justin_o> That's particularly useful if you have a complex object structure that is being passed in.
