2018-11-19T09:56:18  <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon, I’d like to ask something about the Onboarding of the PSP - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2653
2018-11-19T09:56:37  <dandimitrov> From what I’ve understood the idea is to introduce a new solution (a settings group) that is specifically for the PSP - net.gpii.psp. As it defines a new language setting, are we going to have this setting synced with the language setting we're using for the QSS?
2018-11-19T09:57:05  <dandimitrov> And do we expect that in the future we’d have the ability to change the PSP and the System languages independently?
2018-11-19T10:26:22  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes, well that is largely a matter of matchmaking
2018-11-19T10:26:41  <Bosmon> We will make a solutions registry entry for the PSP that has a similar transform to all the other consumers of the language setting

2018-11-19T11:36:43  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: hmm and that way we’ll keep them synced
2018-11-19T11:37:02  <dandimitrov> We were wondering why it is necessary to use an additional language setting instead of listening for the existing one but we're probably missing something
2018-11-19T11:44:19  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - there is no "existing language setting"
2018-11-19T11:44:29  <Bosmon> Each setting is routed to each application separately

2018-11-19T15:04:54  <Bosmon> Just looking around for it .....
2018-11-19T15:05:39  <stegru> no, that's not something I've done, Bosmon
2018-11-19T15:06:11  <stegru> i might have said I'll do it, but I haven't done it
2018-11-19T15:08:31  <jhernandez> IIRC the list of installed languages can be found in a registry key

2018-11-19T16:30:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm attempting to override some listeners ( https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/src/lib/portBinding.js#L368-L373 ) that were originally defined in a parent grade ( https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/src/lib/portBinding.js#L112-L121 ). I was hoping that the args would merge across, but they seem to be lost. Is that expected.
