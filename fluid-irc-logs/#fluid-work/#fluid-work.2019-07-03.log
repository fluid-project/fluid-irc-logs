2019-07-03T11:56:15  <stegru> jhernandez, the wix 4 thing.. are you getting an error?
2019-07-03T11:57:03  <stegru> oh wait.. sorry, i didn't realise I changed it
2019-07-03T12:00:35  <stegru> ok yes, I'm not sure if it's required.. I changed it while adding the util namespace. I didn't think it would matter
2019-07-03T12:02:20  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah
2019-07-03T12:02:40  <jhernandez> I moved it back to 3
2019-07-03T12:02:54  <jhernandez> but then had another problem
2019-07-03T12:02:58  <stegru> ok

2019-07-03T12:03:26  <jhernandez> apparently, I had to pass the -ext WixExtensionUtils to both light and candle commands
2019-07-03T12:03:36  <stegru> oh right
2019-07-03T12:04:22  <jhernandez> and after that, it complained about "a component (the service one) has more than 1 KeyPath"
2019-07-03T12:04:59  <jhernandez> and I figured out that the problem is the thing that prevents windows to remove languages
2019-07-03T12:05:16  <jhernandez> so I disabled that and continued building - other than that, no prob
2019-07-03T12:05:36  <jhernandez> not sure what's the best path - didn't spend a lot taking a look at it
2019-07-03T12:05:46  <stegru> ok
2019-07-03T12:06:00  <jhernandez> I checked if wix 4 was available via choco, but it's not
2019-07-03T12:06:13  <stegru> I thought I tested this, but it turns out i tested something else instead
2019-07-03T12:06:28  <jhernandez> dunno
2019-07-03T12:07:00  <stegru> well, I think just scrap that commit
2019-07-03T12:07:10  <jhernandez> but the installer I have right now doesn't include that feature - which is not "good"
2019-07-03T12:07:33  <stegru> the restart feature?
2019-07-03T12:08:01  <jhernandez> nope, it's missing the "prevent windows to remove languages" only
2019-07-03T12:08:05  <jhernandez> the restart feature is there
2019-07-03T12:08:13  <stegru> ok
2019-07-03T12:08:33  <stegru> I'll work on a fix
2019-07-03T12:08:48  <jhernandez> I can share with you what I made to continue building
2019-07-03T12:09:01  <jhernandez> in case you're interested in taking a look at it
2019-07-03T12:09:06  <stegru> i'll get a whipping if the languages start removing themselves again
2019-07-03T12:09:28  <stegru> yes, might save me some time
2019-07-03T12:12:01  <stegru> ok.. there's 2 ways of disabling the language removal, the installer does both. I guess you've just removed one of them
2019-07-03T12:13:10  <stegru> this is nothing to get upset over, today
2019-07-03T12:13:28  <jhernandez> let me fish up Product.wxs and setup.msbuild files from the vm
2019-07-03T12:13:43  <stegru> no, itr's ok.. i see the problem already
2019-07-03T12:14:07  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-07-03T12:14:25  <stegru> how soon would you like a fix?
2019-07-03T12:16:59  <jhernandez> dunno
2019-07-03T12:17:14  <jhernandez> I guess that you still have more urgent stuff to do, right?
2019-07-03T12:18:43  <stegru> well, nothing that's stopping the installer build
2019-07-03T12:18:50  <jhernandez> btw, here's the change: https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-wix-installer/commit/1ba4c56b33476808992e0b29f05b6213df6bed5d
2019-07-03T12:19:57  <stegru> ok thanks, I'll scrap the service recovery in favour of the method I've actually tested
2019-07-03T12:20:48  <jhernandez> oh, and btw, I'm using the GPII-4004 branches
2019-07-03T12:20:54  <stegru> ok
2019-07-03T12:20:56  <jhernandez> (just in case you want to build the whole thing)
2019-07-03T12:21:14  <jhernandez> everything's up except that change, which I applied manually in the vm

2019-07-03T16:56:09  <javjarfer[m]> hi Bosmon ! sorry, do you know if we have a transform like https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#create-string-from-template-fluidtransformsstringtemplate
2019-07-03T16:56:23  <javjarfer[m]> but that is able to receive the value to inject into the string?
2019-07-03T16:57:23  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - can you elaborate your question please :)
2019-07-03T16:57:35  <javjarfer[m]> I mean, should i be able to use the output path of other transform as the input for a term of that particular transform?
2019-07-03T16:58:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - currently no, the "terms" argument of that transform must be static
2019-07-03T16:59:30  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L705
2019-07-03T16:59:35  <Bosmon> It's a very simple transform

2019-07-03T17:03:43  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: sure, I basically wanted to transform the input value from a setting and inject it into a string like this one: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Speech\Recognizers\Tokens\MS-XXXX-80-DESK
2019-07-03T17:03:53  <javjarfer[m]> you know, where XXXX stands for the part of the string to substitute
2019-07-03T17:04:44  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay... so maybe I should go with a free function
