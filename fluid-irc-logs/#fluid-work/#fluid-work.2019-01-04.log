2019-01-04T09:10:33  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, all. I am sifting through JIRA issues in preparation for beginning my work in the new year.
2019-01-04T09:10:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm closing out stuff that really seems to have been merged.
2019-01-04T09:11:28  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll post questions here as I have them
2019-01-04T09:11:34  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, are you online yet?
2019-01-04T09:11:35  <the-t-in-rtf> issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1826
2019-01-04T09:11:47  <the-t-in-rtf> just confirming that's ready to close
2019-01-04T10:23:28  *** dandimitrov <dandimitrov!~danailbd@37.157.190.158> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-04T12:33:10  <stegru> yes it's probably fixed by now, the-t-in-rtf

2019-01-04T14:40:30  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, is there a practical reason why the current pouch harness is a sub-component of the caseHolder and not the environment?
2019-01-04T14:40:32  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/PouchTestCaseHolder.js#L69
2019-01-04T14:40:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I am converting the tests to use Docker and Couch and writing new test environments, etc
2019-01-04T14:42:45  <the-t-in-rtf> ugh, I fell for it again
2019-01-04T14:42:52  <the-t-in-rtf> the grade has "case holder" in the name but isn't one.
2019-01-04T14:50:02  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i'm stil finding "gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder" as a grade for test case holder.
2019-01-04T14:52:45  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I'm working in a branch... :P
2019-01-04T14:52:49  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a big project!
2019-01-04T14:53:06  <the-t-in-rtf> and is it a case holder?
2019-01-04T14:53:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, it's only got fluid.component
2019-01-04T14:53:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess the rest gets mixed in somewhere?
2019-01-04T14:53:24  <cindyli> cool. thanks, the-t-in-rtf. i don't recall a particular reason that pouch harness was added as a sub-component of the caseHolder. i believe this way is just easier to attach with test definitions.
2019-01-04T14:53:46  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm reworking the bits that generate the case holder and environment from defs, so I can easily rearrange it
2019-01-04T14:53:50  <cindyli> right. locating where it's added into test definition. one sec â€¦
2019-01-04T14:53:59  <the-t-in-rtf> just wanted to see if there was something about the test lifecycle that was important
2019-01-04T14:54:32  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Testing.js#L488
2019-01-04T14:55:12  <the-t-in-rtf> that part is leaving us
2019-01-04T14:55:16  <the-t-in-rtf> say your goodbyes
2019-01-04T14:55:21  <cindyli> haha. ok
2019-01-04T14:55:22  <the-t-in-rtf> it'll all be sequence grades
2019-01-04T14:55:44  <the-t-in-rtf> which will allow us to cleanly express these levels of sequence insertion using just grades and options
2019-01-04T14:56:03  <cindyli> cool. more flexible
2019-01-04T14:56:35  <the-t-in-rtf> https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html#example-of-sequence-building-using-sequencegrade
2019-01-04T14:56:39  <the-t-in-rtf> much
2019-01-04T14:57:18  <the-t-in-rtf> it'll hopefully let us throw out a layer or two of test generation infrastructure to get from test defs to running tests
2019-01-04T14:57:21  <the-t-in-rtf> fingers crossed
2019-01-04T14:57:53  <cindyli> yes, used it only once. it will be lots of work to refactor all universal tests to use this approach tho
2019-01-04T14:58:26  <the-t-in-rtf> well, I'm writing the next-gen to work with the "testDef" concept
2019-01-04T14:58:43  <the-t-in-rtf> so although I'm sure it will be painful, hopefully I only really have to nail down that part well
2019-01-04T14:58:51  <the-t-in-rtf> rather than rewriting individual testdefs
2019-01-04T14:59:12  <cindyli> looking forward to seeing it
2019-01-04T15:45:44  <bryan_> the-t-in-rtf: my ticket GPII-3554 (and subtask GPII-3595) were merged and can be closed. I didnt see a way to close it myself though

2019-01-04T16:54:16  <the-t-in-rtf> do you see any workflow actions on the ticket?
2019-01-04T16:56:22  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, try it now
