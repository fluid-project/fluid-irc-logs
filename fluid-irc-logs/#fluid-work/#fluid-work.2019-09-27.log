2019-09-27T12:18:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm not sure if I'm reading this comment correctly, but it sounds like it is saying you can use assertNode with assertDeepEq. If that's the case, could you explain how to do that?

2019-09-27T18:32:45  <sgithens> clown: oh yeah... I had spent some time on that about a year ago, but it looked like part of it was still being used so I never proceeded
2019-09-27T18:32:50  <sgithens> might be different now

2019-09-27T18:32:53  <sgithens> thanks for picking it up
2019-09-27T18:33:38  <sgithens> just make sure to create a tag of it or something at the point before removal in case we ever need it back or want to look at it fro R&D

2019-09-27T18:44:24  <clown> sgithens:  re: tag â€” sure.  I saw a comment in the JIRA about that and Cindy pointed it out.
2019-09-27T18:44:44  <clown>  I think the tag should be on the master universal branch just before my pull request is merged.
2019-09-27T18:45:18  <clown> if so, someone else will be making tag as I don't have those privileges
2019-09-27T18:46:25  <clown> on another note:  at Wed CouchDB teleconference, you were going to create a document listing all the Couch APIs we use.
2019-09-27T18:46:44  <clown> Did you start that yet?  Is there a document I can contribute to?

2019-09-27T20:25:52  <sgithens> cindyli: We have a page listing all our prefs server/ cloudbased flowmanager REST Urls right? Is the most up to date stuff in our markdown in git or on the old wiki?
2019-09-27T20:26:11  <sgithens> I know we have them for some of the specific markdown docs for the prefs server and stuff
2019-09-27T20:26:35  <sgithens> I was going to start there by going through them all to make the list of what DB query/lookup is performed for each one
2019-09-27T20:28:10  <sgithens> maybe just the combination of PreferencesServer.md and FlowManager.md + @clown scripts would capture them all
2019-09-27T20:29:15  <sgithens> ah, it looks like AuthServer.md too
2019-09-27T20:29:22  <cindyli> sgithens: the latest of those are in the universal repo "documentation" directory
2019-09-27T20:29:46  <cindyli> ah. you've got all of them
2019-09-27T20:30:43  <sgithens> @cindyli I think so yeah
