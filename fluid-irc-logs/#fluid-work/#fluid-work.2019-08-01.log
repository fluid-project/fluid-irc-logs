2019-08-01T14:54:12  <Justin_o> cindyli, jhernandez: If I want to test this issue https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3480, what's the best way to get things setup. Can I just run vagrant from the windows repo?
2019-08-01T14:54:56  <cindyli> Justin_o: you need to run vagrant from gpii-app repo
2019-08-01T14:56:10  <cindyli> the new installer is built from jhernandez's GPII-4004 branch - https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/tree/GPII-4004

2019-08-01T16:00:53  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I'm not on a windows machine, so I'm trying to run gpii-app through the vagrant vm. however when I run "npm start" it complains that "'electron' is not recognized as an internal or external command"
2019-08-01T16:01:10  <Justin_o> same when I try to run npm install from inside the vm
2019-08-01T16:02:23  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-08-01T16:02:46  <jhernandez> Justin_o: is it a new vagrant box?
2019-08-01T16:03:27  <jhernandez> if so, did the provisioning end fine?
2019-08-01T16:04:01  <jhernandez> also, remember that if you want to run npm install inside the vm, ensure that you do that from the v: folder
2019-08-01T16:04:13  <jhernandez> better said, the v: drive
2019-08-01T16:05:32  <Justin_o> oh not c:\vagrant
2019-08-01T16:06:25  <Justin_o> jhernandez: also yes it was a new VM and it did look fine.. maybe I'll destroy and try again
2019-08-01T16:07:05  <jhernandez> switch into v:
2019-08-01T16:07:18  <jhernandez> and see if npm start works fine

2019-08-01T16:07:41  <jhernandez> if you get the same error, maybe npm install didn't complete well or the like - not sure
2019-08-01T16:13:47  <Justin_o> jhernandez: could have been because I ran npm install first from macOS before it stopped and I figured out I needed to be using Windows. I've deleted the local node_modules folder and am trying to build the vm again
2019-08-01T16:16:01  <jhernandez> yeah, that happens to me sometimes :P

2019-08-01T17:09:58  <cindyli> in case you didn't see it
2019-08-01T17:10:14  <clown> thanks, cindyli.  (no I didn't see it).
2019-08-01T17:10:27  <cindyli> np
2019-08-01T17:10:53  <clown> cindyli, is it "Again, anything, in particular, to verify here?"
2019-08-01T17:11:17  <cindyli> nah. "https://issues.gpii.net/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=clown Should the dataloader/Istio PR #442 (https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/442) be also merged as part of this, or not?"
2019-08-01T17:11:23  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. I might have gotten further with the steps in the README now, after removing the local node_modules directory from the host machine. But will see how far it gets
2019-08-01T17:11:41  <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2019-08-01T17:12:12  <cindyli> clown: the last sentence in the comment
2019-08-01T17:20:24  <clown> cindyli, this is a double check:  the tag for the universal docker image is 20190801163411-26be63f, correct?  And the repository is gpii/universal?
2019-08-01T17:22:31  <cindyli> yes, clown. how i usually check is to make sure it points to the latest commit hash in the universal master: 26be63f

2019-08-01T17:25:44  <clown> okay, so looking up latest commit hash on github
2019-08-01T17:27:00  <clown> and they match (latest is a merge of jhernandez/GPII-2210)

2019-08-01T18:25:35  <jhernandez> Justin_o: hmmm
2019-08-01T18:25:56  <jhernandez> are you using a weird screen resolution or the like?
2019-08-01T18:27:03  <jhernandez> can you 1) ctrl-c to stop gpii-app 2) set the vm to full screen mode 3) try again ?
2019-08-01T18:29:26  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I'll give that a shot..
2019-08-01T18:30:16  <Justin_o> I had tried to change the audio settings of the vm through virtual box before, but it was reverted when I launched through vagrant, so I assume all of the settings are being taken care of automatically.
2019-08-01T18:30:34  <jhernandez> it's weird, I'm not getting that with our vagrant box
2019-08-01T18:30:56  <jhernandez> yeah, that should be gone if the machine was destroyed
2019-08-01T18:31:34  <Justin_o> jhernandez: seems you were right about launch in full screen mode first
2019-08-01T18:31:48  <Justin_o> I'm able to change the zoom level now
2019-08-01T18:32:25  <jhernandez> ok, cool
2019-08-01T18:37:27  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I can't seem to reproduce this issue, when you have a chance could you double check if you are still able to reproduce it. https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3480
2019-08-01T18:39:54  <jhernandez> Justin_o: did you increase chrome's content zoom with the app/text zoom thing?
2019-08-01T18:40:46  <Justin_o> jhernandez: I increased it with the chrome's built in zoom feature.. which is also controlled via UIO+ is that what you meant, or was there something else to use
2019-08-01T18:41:03  <jhernandez> yes, there is the qss app/text zoom
2019-08-01T18:41:21  <jhernandez> which does the same
2019-08-01T18:41:36  <jhernandez> but not sure to what degree that matters at all
2019-08-01T18:43:57  <jhernandez> ok, tried to reproduce it and my chrome is not responding :P
2019-08-01T18:45:17  <Justin_o> haha.. I hope that's not UIO+ bug
2019-08-01T18:45:43  <Justin_o> regarding the qss app/text zoom, do you mean "Zoom Top Window"?
2019-08-01T18:46:42  <jhernandez> yes
2019-08-01T18:46:51  <jhernandez> that button
2019-08-01T18:49:17  *** crystalchan <crystalchan!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-ttwpogeluehilnit> has joined #fluid-work
2019-08-01T18:50:10  <Justin_o> okay, still not reproducing it... honestly it's hard to test because the http://www.myskillsource.org has some UI elements that float over the page and block most of the content when the window is small and everything zoomed in.. but I'm still getting the play button below the text and don't see the randomly changing positions
2019-08-01T18:50:35  <Justin_o> does the browser window need to be a certain size? I made it as narrow as it would go.
2019-08-01T18:51:10  <jhernandez> not sure, can't reproduce it either
2019-08-01T18:52:45  <Justin_o> okay.. could have been something that updated with chrome.. should I just close this one as can't reproduce for now?
2019-08-01T18:52:55  <jhernandez> and i see the same, the UI elements that float over the page are very annoying
2019-08-01T18:53:44  <Justin_o> ironic that it's for accessibility
2019-08-01T18:54:13  <jhernandez> I'd say that yes, you can close it as "can't reproduce"
2019-08-01T18:54:28  <jhernandez> or maybe an update they made to the web itself
2019-08-01T18:54:56  <jhernandez> I think I have the same version of google chrome - but can't tell
2019-08-01T18:59:09  <jhernandez> and yeah, trying harder to reproduce the issue
2019-08-01T19:00:26  <jhernandez> for the record, in my case, the play button appears above the text
2019-08-01T19:11:08  <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks.. the play button will appear over or below depending the selected text.. I can't remember all the rules though.. but  it's supposed to try not to go over the text that you want to read
2019-08-01T19:36:17  <jhernandez> sure, I wasn't worried about that
2019-08-01T19:37:10  <jhernandez> I suspected it appears where there is some space left for it

2019-08-01T21:09:53  <gmoss> alanharnum: I've just noticed the staging Storytelling site is down, listing a 502. The CI build has completed successfully, but I think it may be related to the new config file, since the host machine won't have that file present and I neglected to update the docker-compose file with that. I'm running a couple of tests locally to confirm my theory
