2019-11-27T14:48:37  <cindyli> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: I discovered a problem while merging the master, which includes the-t-in-rtf's schema validation work, into my GPII-3828 pull request (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/820). one form of the preference the universal supports is:
2019-11-27T14:48:38  <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier": {
2019-11-27T14:48:38  <cindyli>     http://registry.gpii.net/common/magnification": 3
2019-11-27T14:48:38  <cindyli> }
2019-11-27T14:49:30  <cindyli> as long as "capabilitiesTransformations" and "inverseCapabilitiesTransformations" is defined properly: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/linux.json5#L64
2019-11-27T14:50:25  <Bosmon> Hmm
2019-11-27T14:50:32  <cindyli> as you can see, the nested path is a common term rather than the string "mag-factor" defined in the "supportedSettings" block - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/linux.json5#L23
2019-11-27T14:50:37  <Bosmon> I have a memory that we had decided to abandon this form of preference?
2019-11-27T14:50:43  <cindyli> really?
2019-11-27T14:50:51  <cindyli> if so, my question is answered
2019-11-27T14:51:00  <cindyli> i will remove the test cases for this form

2019-11-27T14:51:29  <Bosmon> Well, not quite yet, since the QSS generates them
2019-11-27T14:51:53  <Bosmon> This JIRA explains a 3-step process we decided to go through : P
2019-11-27T14:54:27  <cindyli> cool. Bosmon, regarding this statement in GPII-4063: "We should review whatever limitations there were, including whether it was difficult to guard against activation of numerous unwanted applications, that stopped us doing this before", i thought we've fixed it
2019-11-27T14:54:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - how so?
2019-11-27T14:55:45  <cindyli> i rmb it happened on windows with high contrast then I fixed it. but i don't rmb what the fix was :(
2019-11-27T14:57:00  <cindyli> but that could be a different issue. we should double check when going thru the 3 steps
2019-11-27T14:57:31  <Bosmon> cindyli - I imagine this would be something to do with kasparnet's "apptology"
2019-11-27T14:58:08  <cindyli> ya, sounds right
2019-11-27T14:58:19  <Bosmon> But, for example, with high contrast, we need to remember how it is established whether all solutions providing high contrast should be activated or not
2019-11-27T14:58:28  <Bosmon> I guess this is also something to do with the meaning of the new "/enabled" term

2019-11-27T15:02:19  <cindyli> ok, i don't rmb if there's such a connection with the "/enabled" term. need to figure it out when working on 4063

2019-11-27T17:51:50  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: is it possible with testem to say, only launch Chrome and only try if it is an available launcher. I'm finding that if chrome isn't installed it throws an error. I saw this while trying to setup CI with GitHub Actions for UIO+
2019-11-27T17:52:24  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, there is a "launch" option and a "skip" option
2019-11-27T17:52:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I think the skip is safest
2019-11-27T17:52:52  <the-t-in-rtf> but as far as I know it should be OK with ignoring unlaunchable stuff unless you try to force it
2019-11-27T17:53:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, but for skip I'd have to list all of the test runners that could possibly be hit?
2019-11-27T17:53:17  <the-t-in-rtf> well, I don't think you should have to
2019-11-27T17:54:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: oh is there a simpler way?
2019-11-27T17:54:10  <Justin_o> this is the list of launchers that I've found, https://github.com/testem/testem/blob/master/docs/browser_args.md#launchers
2019-11-27T17:54:10  <the-t-in-rtf> to answer your question, though, node node_modules/testem/testem.js ci --file tests/testem.js --launch Chrome
2019-11-27T17:54:38  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks, I'm using the "launch" option in the testem.js file
2019-11-27T17:54:55  <Justin_o> but it was still trying to hit "Chrome" on the macOS runner even though Chrome isn't available there
2019-11-27T17:55:19  *** jhung_2 <jhung_2!~jhung@CPE18e829ac96f5-CMa84e3f431590.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #fluid-work
2019-11-27T17:55:40  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I also tried to run Chrome headless, but it keeps hanging https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/commit/efe54d45c17ac7da13fa64310ec396f7075aa58c/checks?check_suite_id=331883000
2019-11-27T17:55:58  <Justin_o> that's my test runs from GitHub Actions that were attempting to use chrome headless
2019-11-27T17:56:10  <Justin_o> it times out on both Ubuntu and Windows
2019-11-27T17:56:19  <the-t-in-rtf> ok, too many issues at once
2019-11-27T17:56:28  <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess the one is trying to work around the other
2019-11-27T17:56:31  <the-t-in-rtf> let's deal with the launcher
2019-11-27T17:57:10  <Justin_o> not exactly working around the other, but similar.. the Ubuntu runner can run chrome because of a GTK error it was getting.. so was trying to just use Chrome Headless instead
2019-11-27T17:57:12  <the-t-in-rtf> is your branch checked in where I can see the file?
2019-11-27T17:57:32  <the-t-in-rtf> the launcher is one issue
2019-11-27T17:57:34  <the-t-in-rtf> headless is another
2019-11-27T17:57:45  <the-t-in-rtf> each environment other than native is its own issue
2019-11-27T17:57:47  <Justin_o> yah.. I'm playing in my repo's master branch so I can see all the Actions stuff running.. I'm going to blow it all away when I figure out how to get it to work and can add it properly to the repo.
2019-11-27T17:57:52  <the-t-in-rtf> let's stick to the launcher for a bit

2019-11-27T17:58:22  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry
2019-11-27T17:58:31  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the ticket for known problems with headless chrome
2019-11-27T17:58:51  <the-t-in-rtf> there is a workaround in that ticket
2019-11-27T18:00:29  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: so I did run into the issue when trying to use the Headless Chrome launcher, but the hanging issue I mentioned was using the HEADLESS environment variable
2019-11-27T18:00:35  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, for now I would suggest skipping everything you don't want
2019-11-27T18:00:40  <the-t-in-rtf> including Headless Chrome
2019-11-27T18:00:48  <the-t-in-rtf> the HEADLESS fix won't really work without that I think
2019-11-27T18:00:49  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/blob/master/tests/testem.js#L45
2019-11-27T18:00:52  <the-t-in-rtf> that's an example
2019-11-27T18:00:55  <the-t-in-rtf> skip everything you don't want
2019-11-27T18:01:13  <the-t-in-rtf> and if you need to test with a single browser, launch testem yourself without CI or add --launch on the command line
2019-11-27T18:01:21  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: here's the commit I tried the headless environment variable https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/commit/728e3911894741f082003bfecdcf181823a9f784
2019-11-27T18:02:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: actually trying all of this stuff explicitly for creating CI for UIO+
2019-11-27T18:02:20  <the-t-in-rtf> a worthy goal
2019-11-27T18:02:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I think you should write up the problems with launch but rely on skip for now
2019-11-27T18:02:41  <the-t-in-rtf> and you at least need to skip "Headless Chrome"
2019-11-27T18:04:11  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, thanks
2019-11-27T18:08:34  <sgithens> cindyli: Could you paste me once more where it is that you had to cut and paste the SPI hacks from my GPII-228 branch?

2019-11-27T19:39:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I've tried configuring testem with launch: "Chrome" and skip: "Headless Chrome" but get the timeouts when setting the "HEADLESS" environment variable. https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/runs/323582568
2019-11-27T19:39:57  <the-t-in-rtf> why are you launching Chrome?
2019-11-27T19:40:05  <the-t-in-rtf> it's enough to skip the other.
2019-11-27T19:41:18  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, I assume you mean you get timeouts in GitHub Actions?
2019-11-27T19:41:26  <the-t-in-rtf> does it work on a normal machine?
2019-11-27T19:48:15  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if you're still stuck at the end of the day, commit what you have and at mention or email me.
2019-11-27T19:48:25  <the-t-in-rtf> It's very late here but I'm game to look at it in more depth tomorrow.

2019-11-27T20:36:00  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for getting back to me. It looks like it's actually timing out on a failed test.
2019-11-27T20:36:47  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: reason to target chrome is that it is currently the only place that the tests run, UIO+ is only supported on Chrome. I'll probably open this up more, there is only one set of tests that requires chrome, so I'll see if I can fix that up.
2019-11-27T20:37:59  <Justin_o> interestingly it is the same test that is causing this problem. So it runs in chrome on windows, but not chrome with the HEADLESS environment variable.

2019-11-27T21:13:52  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  also just tried locally and the same issue happens.
2019-11-27T21:30:19  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe just a smidge more about "locally" would be good.
2019-11-27T21:30:23  <the-t-in-rtf> OS?
2019-11-27T21:30:50  <the-t-in-rtf> With that and the branch I can try things out tomorrow
