Then you can chime in with your thoughts about it. Does that make sense?

2020-04-29T15:15:10  <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: do you have thoughts on creating an NPM org? I think originally we didn't create one when they came out because they were only for paid orgs.. It looks like now you can have unlimited public repos for free. https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
2020-04-29T15:15:47  <Justin_o> I sort of came into that because I need to create node module for uio-plus and I was trying to remember how to setup permissions
2020-04-29T15:16:17  <Justin_o> and I guess we could also decide if we want to use scopes more

2020-04-29T15:45:09  <greatislander> Justin_o we have an NPM organization for the Platform Co-op project. One gotcha I noticed was that when publishing a scoped package, you must use `--access public` on free organizations otherwise it will try to publish it privately and bug you to upgrade to a paid plan.
2020-04-29T15:45:41  <greatislander> (minor thing, sharing so it doesn't trip you up the way it did with me :) )
2020-04-29T15:47:31  <Justin_o> that's annoying.. I think you can add a property to your package.json file as well. I think I read that today.. I'll see if I can find that again.
2020-04-29T15:48:04  *** Teddy___ <Teddy___!uid407930@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-ngidajwgcbxcbdgh> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-29T15:48:42  <greatislander> perhaps it goes in .npmrc, Justin_o
2020-04-29T15:49:05  <greatislander> I haven't looked into it too much because I added an npm script for publishing which includes that flag so I don't have to worry about it anymore
2020-04-29T15:49:34  <Justin_o> regarding npmrc you can do this https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-your-npm-client-with-your-org-settings
2020-04-29T15:49:45  <Justin_o> I'm having trouble finding what I was thinking about, so I might have been thinking of something else
2020-04-29T15:52:56  <Justin_o> greatislander: it was something different that I was looking at, although related. It's part of the np tool https://www.npmjs.com/package/np#public-scoped-packages
2020-04-29T15:53:13  <greatislander> oh right on
2020-04-29T15:53:31  <Justin_o> so thanks for the tip, I hadn't noticed that as a requirement for publishing scopes to NPM
2020-04-29T15:53:45  <greatislander> glad to help!
2020-04-29T15:55:51  <colinclark> Justin_o: I don’t have a particular opinion
2020-04-29T15:56:00  <colinclark> if it’s helpful, go for it
2020-04-29T15:58:05  <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks.. I think it might be helpful just for grouping things and assigning permissions. Also you don't have to use scopes for orgs
2020-04-29T15:58:18  <colinclark> sounds good to me
2020-04-29T15:58:30  <colinclark> and easier than having to assign permissions per module
2020-04-29T16:02:53  <jhernandez> arch meeting time guys!
2020-04-29T16:03:34  <Justin_o> colinclark: that's what I'm hoping. greatislander is that how things work in your experience with NPM orgs?
2020-04-29T16:03:44  <colinclark> jhernandez: good luck!
2020-04-29T16:03:56  <colinclark> i’m sure your socks will be knocked off
2020-04-29T16:03:58  <colinclark> :P
2020-04-29T16:04:31  <greatislander> Justin_o I'm not quite sure I am grasping the question-- quick call to clarify?
2020-04-29T16:05:36  <Justin_o> greatislander: sorry, heading into another meeting now.
2020-04-29T16:05:41  <Justin_o> greatislander: do you have time later today?
2020-04-29T16:05:57  <greatislander> Yeah, I'll be around until 2 eastern so let me know anytime you are free and we can chat quickly
