2018-11-09T08:21:34  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru and @javjarfer[m], if you don't already know, you're both hitting the same test failure in universal branches
2018-11-09T08:21:50  <the-t-in-rtf> If the solution is known, now's the time to close the loop
2018-11-09T08:21:56  <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise I'm investigating the problem
2018-11-09T08:23:25  <the-t-in-rtf> (the "isError" failure in UserLogonStateChange.js)
2018-11-09T08:37:20  <the-t-in-rtf> Hope everyone likes red herring for breakfast, that failure is just masking an upstream error.
2018-11-09T08:37:50  <the-t-in-rtf> running the tests now with the fix I suggested on the universal pull @stegru submitted: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/705#issuecomment-437287897
2018-11-09T08:46:30  <the-t-in-rtf> my theory is that someone added code to the device reporter but didn't update the nyc config
2018-11-09T08:46:47  <the-t-in-rtf> so the device reporter is horking silently under some conditions and we just weren't set up to hear it
2018-11-09T08:47:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm running the tests without nyc at the moment to confirm
2018-11-09T08:47:37  <the-t-in-rtf> by "code" I mean a new file, as in a new config or new code
2018-11-09T08:55:53  <the-t-in-rtf> that or a file was removed but is still referenced indirectly, like in a kettle config require
2018-11-09T08:57:10  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I already see that the gpii-ini-file content isn't included in the instrumentation
2018-11-09T08:57:14  <the-t-in-rtf> that alone could explain it
2018-11-09T08:58:10  <the-t-in-rtf> also the user errors
2018-11-09T08:58:14  <the-t-in-rtf> ... :|
2018-11-09T09:00:53  <the-t-in-rtf> also the exploding settings handler
2018-11-09T09:01:14  <the-t-in-rtf> and the launch settings handler
2018-11-09T09:05:07  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I added everything missing, running with nyc now
2018-11-09T09:05:21  <the-t-in-rtf> as I suspected, the error doesn't occur when running the node tests outside of nyc
2018-11-09T09:05:25  <the-t-in-rtf> this strongly supports my theory
2018-11-09T09:06:54  <the-t-in-rtf> So, @stegru and @javjarfer[m], I can submit the small fix as a pull against one of your existing branches
2018-11-09T09:07:13  <the-t-in-rtf> we can either play it "first come first served", or you can talk amongst yourselves and agree which would be least disruptive
2018-11-09T09:14:57  <javjarfer[m]> hey the-t-in-rtf (IRC) that's nice
2018-11-09T09:15:50  <javjarfer[m]> well, I'm confortable with simply merging your branch into my existing ones, you don't need to submit a pull against mines
2018-11-09T09:16:00  <javjarfer[m]> so if that works for you, it works for me :)
2018-11-09T09:16:09  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will start with @stegru's branch, which is where I'm working now
2018-11-09T09:17:20  <javjarfer[m]> great, I will wait then for your confirmation to update several branches I have against master
2018-11-09T09:20:13  <the-t-in-rtf> it passes.
2018-11-09T09:20:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll need a minute to patch a branch and give you something clean to merge changes from
2018-11-09T09:34:13  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru and @javjarfer[m], here's a branch that should fix the failure you're seeing: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/tree/GPII-3469
2018-11-09T09:36:28  <the-t-in-rtf> It adds handling for undefined device reporter payloads and updates Steve's list of excludes to include all missing files.
2018-11-09T09:36:54  <the-t-in-rtf> It's based on Steve's branch, which is where I was investigating, I hope that's not going to make things difficult for you, @javjarfer[m].
2018-11-09T09:37:11  <the-t-in-rtf> See if you can add me as a remote and merge without problems, happy to help if needed.
2018-11-09T09:42:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to alphabetise the gpii/node_modules includes to review them without driving myself crazy.
2018-11-09T09:42:33  <the-t-in-rtf> so it'll seem more disruptive than it actually is.
2018-11-09T09:42:59  <the-t-in-rtf> s/includes/excludes
2018-11-09T09:43:33  <the-t-in-rtf> the other change should be no problem unless you're specifically updating the logon state change code

2018-11-09T10:10:52  <javjarfer[m]> hi the-t-in-rtf (IRC) , thanks I was checking if that pull is very conflicting with the pulls that I have
2018-11-09T10:11:17  <javjarfer[m]> I don't really know, if you don't mind I might cherry-picks the commits instead of a full merge
2018-11-09T10:11:31  <javjarfer[m]> what you think about that jhernandez ?
2018-11-09T10:13:58  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: cherry pick what?
2018-11-09T10:15:47  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf (IRC) added some commits to a stegru (IRC) pull to fix the issues with the CI error "(the "isError" failure in UserLogonStateChange.js)"
2018-11-09T10:16:05  <javjarfer[m]> that pull may be conflicting with mine until it get merged
2018-11-09T10:20:53  <stegru> ok
2018-11-09T10:21:17  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: which one?
2018-11-09T10:27:12  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/tree/GPII-3469
2018-11-09T10:27:24  <jhernandez> yeah, I was reading back the log
2018-11-09T10:27:42  <stegru> I just picked the last 2
2018-11-09T10:29:31  <jhernandez> ahhhh
2018-11-09T10:29:36  <jhernandez> my karma
2018-11-09T10:29:41  <jhernandez> !!
2018-11-09T10:29:42  <jhernandez> xDD
2018-11-09T10:29:56  <jhernandez> why just not having different things in different branches?
2018-11-09T10:29:57  <jhernandez> xDD
2018-11-09T10:31:06  <jhernandez> and not mixing them?
2018-11-09T10:31:18  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: I guess that you can cherry pick them in the same way stegru did
2018-11-09T10:31:57  <jhernandez> having a conflict is not a problem, since CI will continue running either
2018-11-09T10:32:03  <jhernandez> if that was your concern
2018-11-09T10:33:12  <stegru> ¿que?
2018-11-09T10:33:24  <jhernandez> what?
2018-11-09T10:33:53  <stegru> i have a ¿ key
2018-11-09T10:34:15  <stegru> alt gr + shift + -
2018-11-09T10:34:24  <jhernandez> + -
2018-11-09T10:34:26  <jhernandez> ?
2018-11-09T10:34:54  <jhernandez> so the combination is alt gr + shift, more or less ?
2018-11-09T10:35:02  <jhernandez> :P
2018-11-09T10:35:08  <stegru> heh

2018-11-09T13:41:07  <jhernandez> and the provisioning worked fine, right?
2018-11-09T13:41:22  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I definitely created VMs and ran tests a few times.
2018-11-09T13:41:38  <jhernandez> IIRC, I had it working a couple of months ago, but today with the most recent vagrant box it doesn't

2018-11-09T13:42:20  <the-t-in-rtf> there was a recent change to provisioning.ps1
2018-11-09T13:42:25  <jhernandez> yup
2018-11-09T13:42:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I just pulled that down from master
2018-11-09T13:42:49  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, rebuilding my VM to see if I can reproduce
2018-11-09T13:42:50  <the-t-in-rtf> it'll be a bit

2018-11-09T13:59:38  <the-t-in-rtf> by that you mean it works from v:/?
2018-11-09T14:01:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, more details?
2018-11-09T14:01:13  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, when you said provisioning I wasn't a 100% sure what you meant
2018-11-09T14:01:25  <the-t-in-rtf> If you meant vagrant, mine definitely provisioned correctly
2018-11-09T14:01:35  <jhernandez> yup, vagrant
2018-11-09T14:01:38  <jhernandez> hmm

2018-11-09T15:45:39  <jhernandez> okay, and we can do this in a custom action as well, right?
2018-11-09T15:45:42  <stegru> yes
2018-11-09T15:46:38  <stegru> maybe we should just run a "install.ps1" script?
2018-11-09T15:47:07  <jhernandez> yeah, that is what I was thinking about
2018-11-09T15:47:28  <stegru> oh, your process killing thing would happen before it's installed, not after
2018-11-09T15:47:38  <jhernandez> if we are about to start adding custom actions, yes, maybe we should just add a single thing that does all this
2018-11-09T15:47:47  <jhernandez> haha
2018-11-09T15:48:57  <jhernandez> I guess that I've made it the right way
2018-11-09T15:49:01  <jhernandez> Custom Action=”KillApp” Before=”InstallValidate”
2018-11-09T15:49:25  <stegru> there's one way of finding out

2018-11-09T16:35:25  <jhernandez> okay, just installed on top of a previous version and it killed the app before proceeding with the installation step
2018-11-09T16:35:51  <jhernandez> the only thing, I'm seeing a cmd prompt window flashing
2018-11-09T16:36:54  <jhernandez> but it does work

2018-11-09T16:56:40  <jhernandez> stegru: testing was slow (install, uninstall, install on top, etc), but here's the pull request https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/49
2018-11-09T16:58:42  <jhernandez> if we are going to add more things, maybe I should create a bug pull request that includes a script that include this one, the change to remove the folders and the firewall rule
2018-11-09T16:59:46  <stegru> maybe
2018-11-09T17:02:14  <jhernandez> okay, I gotta leave now
2018-11-09T17:02:43  <jhernandez> more on this on Monday
2018-11-09T17:02:44  <stegru> i'll give it a quick test and merge this
2018-11-09T17:02:48  <jhernandez> okay
