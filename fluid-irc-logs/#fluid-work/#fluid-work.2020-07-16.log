2020-07-16T15:20:46  <colinclark> hey philip, congratulations on your Kettle release!
2020-07-16T15:22:16  <philip> Thanks colinclark. Hopefully, if it was done right, no other Kettle users should notice anything's changed :P
2020-07-16T15:26:36  <colinclark> I’m sure it’ll be fine
2020-07-16T15:30:04  <gmoss> philip: am I the only other Kettle user at this point? ;)
2020-07-16T15:32:13  <philip> gmoss you want to join the even more exclusive club of Nexus users?
2020-07-16T15:32:26  <philip> Because we have a hot new 1.2.0 release
2020-07-16T16:20:04  <gmoss> did the call just get ended?
2020-07-16T16:20:09  <clown> philip, I was kicked out of the meeting.
2020-07-16T16:20:16  <clown> "ended by host"
2020-07-16T16:20:21  * clown on my way back.
2020-07-16T16:20:35  <philip> I suspect Colin had to run and accidentally nuked the meeting
2020-07-16T16:46:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: it just occurred to me that greatislander might have some input to share for the commit logs topic, but I think he's away next week.. did you want to defer your talk to later?
2020-07-16T16:47:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah that's true, he uses a very different style
2020-07-16T16:47:18  <gmoss> I think that's prudent
2020-07-16T16:47:44  <gmoss> Justin_o: feel free to slot me in any date after his return
2020-07-16T16:48:45  <gmoss> philip: while it's still top of mind, do you have a link to the page that suggested commit messages in the imperative mood?
2020-07-16T16:51:23  <philip> Yeah gmoss, I think this is it https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative
2020-07-16T16:51:38  <gmoss> philip: awesome, thanks :)
2020-07-16T16:52:26  <philip> The reasons given are "it's how git generates messages" and "if you think about it, this describes what a commit 'does'"
2020-07-16T16:52:34  <philip> Neither of which I find very convincing in retrospect
2020-07-16T18:00:06  <Justin_o> gmoss: would you like to do July 30th for the commit logs talk?
2020-07-16T18:05:03  <gmoss> Justin_o: sorry I'd stepped away for a moment. the 30th is good on my end!
2020-07-16T18:06:22  <Justin_o> thanks.. I'll add it to the document and try to remember
2020-07-16T18:06:26  <Justin_o> gmoss: ^
2020-07-16T18:07:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: thanks :) I'll add it to my calendar either way
2020-07-16T18:10:03  <Justin_o> gmoss: great thanks :)
2020-07-16T22:07:35  <colinclark> Justin_o: are you still around, by chance?
