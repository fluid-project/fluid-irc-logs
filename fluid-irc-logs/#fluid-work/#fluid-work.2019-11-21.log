2019-11-21T13:33:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: continuing our conversation from fluid-design that should have been here. I switched the distributeOptions call to just be an IoC expression in the gradeNames. That seems to have moved me past that hurdle. This approach wasn't working before, because there had been an intermediate distribution of that value, which the IoC expression had been pointing at. Which is to say, that it was pointing at nothing due
2019-11-21T13:33:11  <Justin_o> to the problem we saw with the options distribution.
2019-11-21T13:33:18  <Justin_o> anyways, on to the next problem :)

2019-11-21T14:37:55  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, I think @clown will be around to talk in a minute if you're able to meet.
2019-11-21T14:48:37  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, I've toughened up checks to catch prolapsed "enabled" settings, just confirming whether "conditions" are still supported?
2019-11-21T14:48:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm also seeing all the orphaned "metadata" blocks, which I assume can be removed?
2019-11-21T14:50:58  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  conditions are not supported in the ContextManager changes pull
2019-11-21T14:51:05  <clown> in fact, they are gone.
2019-11-21T14:51:11  <the-t-in-rtf> great
2019-11-21T14:51:25  <clown> But, that pull has not been merged, as you know
2019-11-21T14:51:35  <the-t-in-rtf> in our earlier meeting we were noticing preferences that were outside of the preferences block
2019-11-21T14:51:57  <clown> "earlier meeting" means yesterday's arch meeting?
2019-11-21T14:51:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I added a check to prevent additional material outside that block, and started noticing the conditions
2019-11-21T14:52:06  <the-t-in-rtf> no, "versioned solutions", a bit earlier
2019-11-21T14:52:14  <clown> oh, okay that one.
2019-11-21T14:53:26  <the-t-in-rtf> Once we can agree on a deployment sequence, I may pull your context changes in the branch for the LSR work.
2019-11-21T14:53:39  <the-t-in-rtf> as I suspect you got rid of a lot of the cruft I can suddenly see.
2019-11-21T14:54:26  <clown> I imagine there is also some effects on cindyli's work since the changes to the CM involved the PSPChannel
2019-11-21T14:54:36  <clown> *everything connects*
2019-11-21T14:56:04  <cindyli> clown, the-t-in-rtf, don't worry about my branches. i will resolve conflicts in them once your branches are merged

2019-11-21T15:00:22  <the-t-in-rtf> We can schedule a time for tomorrow if he's in meeting.
2019-11-21T15:00:26  <Bosmon> Hi yes, I am here
2019-11-21T15:00:32  <the-t-in-rtf> oops.
2019-11-21T15:00:34  <Justin_o> I guess you guys can start while we wait for colinclark
2019-11-21T15:00:35  <Bosmon> Is there much to talk about re. clown's pull?
2019-11-21T15:00:59  <clown> I don't think so, but I'll defer to Tony
2019-11-21T15:01:02  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, we have to agree on which things to merge, how to push them to gpii-infra, and how to test them.
2019-11-21T15:01:10  <the-t-in-rtf> I think we have a good sense of the first and third
2019-11-21T15:01:17  <the-t-in-rtf> just wanted to check with @clown on the second
2019-11-21T15:01:29  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. why did he need to know which universal to use in his "production tests" pull
2019-11-21T15:01:38  <the-t-in-rtf> were there associated changes in universal?
2019-11-21T15:02:15  <clown> it has to do with gpii-infra;s "versions.yml" file that declares the verison of the universal docker image to use
2019-11-21T15:02:19  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I know
2019-11-21T15:02:23  <Bosmon> I believe that nothing in his branch could ever be exercised by the production tests
2019-11-21T15:02:24  <the-t-in-rtf> but why did you have to change it at all?
2019-11-21T15:02:39  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if you're not changing universal, just pull whatever is in master of gpii-infra
2019-11-21T15:02:40  <clown> My pull uses 20190920182823-c3cc79b
2019-11-21T15:02:53  <clown> that is more recent than the one currently in production.
2019-11-21T15:03:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I see, so there are changes you need that aren't in production.
2019-11-21T15:03:25  <clown> and, I imagine after you merge your changes into universal, there will be another version created.
2019-11-21T15:03:32  <the-t-in-rtf> right
2019-11-21T15:03:41  <clown> I can use that one, but I need to know what the tag is etc to change versions,yml.
2019-11-21T15:03:53  <the-t-in-rtf> so what you have doesn't work with what's in production?
2019-11-21T15:04:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume not, otherwise we wouldn't need to have this conversation.
2019-11-21T15:04:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if I understand correctly, seems clear.  We merge what we plan to push to production, then a new container is created.
2019-11-21T15:04:41  <clown> No, it doesn't.  I discovered that running the production tests in the cloud required mods to the production test code in universal.
2019-11-21T15:04:46  <the-t-in-rtf> aha
2019-11-21T15:05:06  <the-t-in-rtf> that's what I thought must be the case.
2019-11-21T15:05:18  <clown> those changes were made in a pull against universal, and merged into master a while back.
2019-11-21T15:05:34  <the-t-in-rtf> we had previously discussed merging my validation/performance work and your context manager stuff, then using that release moving forward

2019-11-21T15:05:45  <clown> that resulted in a new docker image in gpii/universal, and that's the one I currently use,..
2019-11-21T15:05:49  <the-t-in-rtf> right
2019-11-21T15:06:08  <clown> side note:  I just looked at the docker repo, and that are even more recent images since then.
2019-11-21T15:06:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not surprised
2019-11-21T15:06:30  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I guess it's down to when @Bosmon can merge the two key universal pulls
2019-11-21T15:06:53  <clown> anyhow, that's the basis of my question:  what version of universal is my gpii-infra pull supposed to use?
2019-11-21T15:07:07  <Bosmon> I can merge them this afternoon
2019-11-21T15:07:14  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I guess whatever gets cut after those two merges
2019-11-21T15:07:18  <clown> one that doesn't currently exist, but will soon.
2019-11-21T15:07:23  <clown> apparently this afternoon...
2019-11-21T15:07:26  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-11-21T15:08:02  <the-t-in-rtf> and we can discuss the ordering of the infra merges later.  I guess if we do one to test the new container then your production tests one is a low-stakes merge late next week?
2019-11-21T15:08:36  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I'll put in a fresh one with the version of universal we intend to deploy and we can just focus on documenting what's changed for Kavya and ourselves to test in staging.
2019-11-21T15:08:44  <colinclark> Justin_o, Bosmon, cindyli: Please go ahead and meet without me. I don’t know how long this will take.
2019-11-21T15:09:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: are you meeting with the-t-in-rtf and clown at the moment?

2019-11-21T15:09:36  <Justin_o> thanks
2019-11-21T15:10:19  <clown> you made that suggestion in your email from yesterday.
2019-11-21T15:10:35  <clown> if I read it correctly :-)
2019-11-21T15:10:35  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but I wanted to understand what version your gpii-infra pull actually *needed*
2019-11-21T15:10:39  <the-t-in-rtf> which I do now
2019-11-21T15:10:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: let me know when you're ready to start.

2019-11-21T15:11:08  <cindyli> Justin_o, Bosmon, i'm ready
2019-11-21T15:11:15  <clown> the answer is at least '20190920182823-c3cc79b" and anything thereafter, the-t-in-rtf
2019-11-21T15:11:58  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
2019-11-21T15:12:12  <clown> caveat:  on the assumption that you are not touching any of the production test code or data it relies on.
2019-11-21T15:12:23  <the-t-in-rtf> nope
2019-11-21T15:12:40  <the-t-in-rtf> well, "code or data it relies on" is a bit nebulous

2019-11-21T15:25:24  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  just browsing your pull.  There are changes to test defs that the prod tests uses.  But CI says they passed (https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-tests/1986/)
2019-11-21T15:25:29  <clown> so, that's likely fine.
2019-11-21T15:26:33  <clown> There are also changes to PSPChannel tests, which relates to the ContextManager changes.  It will be interesting to see how the two pulls merge.

2019-11-21T15:49:22  <clown> Bosmon:  a heads-up regarding the ContextManager pull
2019-11-21T15:50:06  <clown> The JIRA suggests tagging universal just before merging the changes so as to have a way to find the ContextManager code if we ever want it in the future.
2019-11-21T15:50:40  <clown> I don't know if that still applies, but I believe only someone with commit access could make such a tag,

2019-11-21T16:37:11  <cindyli> clown: what we usually do when removing module(s) from the universal is: 1. set the jira "labels" to "RetiredCode"; 2. Add the link pointing to the last commit hash right before the pull request merged into the JIRA

2019-11-21T16:38:08  <cindyli> we should double check with sgithens about it
2019-11-21T16:38:14  <cindyli> right, forgot about the standup

2019-11-21T18:05:07  <sgithens> clown , cindyli So exciting to have a tag so that it can be brought back to life when we inevitably make an IoT sensor or something!
2019-11-21T18:07:26  <cindyli> sgithens: as long as there's a commit hash, we can run "git reset —hard {hash}" to bring the repo back to that commit
2019-11-21T18:09:36  <sgithens> it's very exciting :)
2019-11-21T18:10:09  <sgithens> I think I had recommeded tags, just so they wouldn't get lost in case the jira got lost, but it probably doens't matter
2019-11-21T18:10:51  <sgithens> it will be like the resurgence in vinyl, when the people demand the PSP and Context and Environment reporter again

2019-11-21T19:56:16  <cindyli> sgithens, clown, i have no objection against creating a github tag for the last appearance of the context manager, but since previous retired code were using "RetiredCode" jira label + a tracked commit hash and had no complaint…
2019-11-21T19:56:32  <cindyli> Bosmon, can you please make the call ^
2019-11-21T19:59:46  <clown> cindyli:  to be clear, I'm happy with a label on the JIRA of "RetiredCode" and recording the sha in the JIRA.  I'm suggesting also adding a human readable tag.
2019-11-21T20:05:54  <clown> also:  the tag can be added or deleted at any time, with no side effects
