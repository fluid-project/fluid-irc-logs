2018-11-23T08:40:34  <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon !
2018-11-23T08:47:03  <Bosmon> Hi there javjarfer[m]
2018-11-23T08:48:13  <javjarfer[m]> HI there! I just wanted to ask you about your comment of 'fluid.lens'
2018-11-23T08:48:25  <javjarfer[m]> is there any place where I can find more information about that?
2018-11-23T08:58:03  *** georgitodorov <georgitodorov!~georgitod@37.157.190.158> has joined #fluid-work
2018-11-23T09:08:19  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:
2018-11-23T09:20:06  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m] - unfortunately our pal KASPARNET didn't quite finish the explanation of what the different grades do.... other than the reference in this paragraph: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#structure-of-a-transformation-document
2018-11-23T09:20:44  <Bosmon> You'll have to consult the source in this case - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L49
2018-11-23T09:21:41  <Bosmon> Which isn't terrible informative apart from suggesting that you need to implement the invertConfiguration function
2018-11-23T09:23:21  <Bosmon> And then consulting some examples - one of the clearest pair to understand is perhaps numberToString/stringToNumber: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L54
2018-11-23T09:30:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: great, I reached the paragraph but was the unique transform that was not mentioned. It's good to know where to look for that
2018-11-23T09:30:41  <Bosmon> Do feel free to submit an infusion-docs PR, I know we should get round to this soon :)
2018-11-23T09:31:03  <javjarfer[m]> oh, well that would be cool, completing that doc
2018-11-23T09:32:00  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: do you saw any other problems with the way I wrote that transform?
2018-11-23T09:32:10  <javjarfer[m]> It's good to know that I can write one in case of needing it
2018-11-23T09:34:13  <Bosmon> Can you remind me which pull it is in?
2018-11-23T09:34:31  <Bosmon> In general if you write a new transform you should write a dedicated unit test just for the transform
2018-11-23T09:37:32  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/636/files/6c5be5c4d86b11a21cdc6c457a678078234198e5#diff-4761d2a2cd6f9783a0e0a35a5507df70R175
2018-11-23T09:37:49  <javjarfer[m]> I think I don't have unit tests for that transform
2018-11-23T09:39:26  <Bosmon> If we were considering this for inclusion, we'd notice that it is expressed in a rather low-level way
2018-11-23T09:39:45  <Bosmon> In general only the most unusual and complex transforms manipulate outputPrefixOp directly etc.
2018-11-23T09:40:06  <Bosmon> You might consider the base grade "multiInputTransform" which automates some of the work
2018-11-23T09:40:25  <Bosmon> Also the transform is expressed in a rather "un-functional" way, with repeated assignments to the same variables and no use of "else" clauses
2018-11-23T09:40:35  <Bosmon> There's no need to forget absolutely everything you learned coding in Haskell : P
2018-11-23T09:48:34  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_Bos "There's no need to forget absolu"> hahah great, this is all good to know, I used GPII style guide, if I need to write another one in the future I will take all this into account

2018-11-23T13:00:05  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon , do you have time to take a look to the solution for using "fluid.transforms.firstValue"
2018-11-23T13:00:10  <javjarfer[m]> that I talked you about yesterday?

2018-11-23T13:46:40  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, probably ok
2018-11-23T13:47:32  <Bosmon> You can probably express a bit more compactly by moving "value" into the path - e.g. "DefaultColorConfig.value": {literalValue: {r: 0, g: 0, b: 0} } etc
