2019-06-07T13:51:30  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @cindyli, did you get any further with testing?
2019-06-07T13:51:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I was hoping to get the payload, etc. syntax for the auth request from you so I could also try testing things
2019-06-07T14:02:32  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  FYI:  although the meeting has not officially started, Vidyo is up and feel free to join anytime.
2019-06-07T14:02:39  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i can certainly send you requests and payloads for testing. the universal image that was deployed to the staging yesterday is for the previous commit hash before the merge of your validation pull. the correct one should be https://ci.gpii.net/view/Docker/job/docker-gpii-universal-master/181

2019-06-07T14:05:50  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, great, that explains it
2019-06-07T14:06:18  <the-t-in-rtf> and thanks, @clown, I've been here for 2 hours, just waiting for the word

2019-06-07T14:08:07  <clown> word, the-t-in-rtf
2019-06-07T14:10:29  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli1, did anyone already put in a new pull?
2019-06-07T14:12:18  <the-t-in-rtf> @clown, the vidyo client is just atrocious again, I'm going to try using the web interface
2019-06-07T14:13:37  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  :-(
2019-06-07T14:13:47  <the-t-in-rtf> can someone send the web link?
2019-06-07T14:13:55  <the-t-in-rtf> the one I have from a couple days ago says "invalid portal"
2019-06-07T14:14:02  <the-t-in-rtf> "invalid conference portal"
2019-06-07T14:14:53  <the-t-in-rtf> nm, figured it out
2019-06-07T14:14:58  <the-t-in-rtf> one of the redirects didn't use https
2019-06-07T14:16:50  <the-t-in-rtf> me
2019-06-07T14:22:15  <cindyli1> the-t-in-rtf: no one has put in the new pull yet. do you wanna issue it, with the new tag?
2019-06-07T14:22:32  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2019-06-07T14:26:18  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's why I asked
2019-06-07T14:26:19  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
