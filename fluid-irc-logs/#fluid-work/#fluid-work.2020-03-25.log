2020-03-25T03:43:33  <batey96_> justin_o: , gmoss: assuming the static site generator's repository is properly synced with documentation repository during build(all things being equal with with continous integration and deployment),how does the developer manage the documentation when he is running the static site generator locally??.
2020-03-25T03:46:07  <batey96_> because it will not be likely for the developer to manage content separately(practically impossible unless he is symlynking).At the end, it shows tha
2020-03-25T03:51:00  <batey96_> that the developer still needs the content repo(folder) mixed with the static site generator(eventhough at a later time in could still be .gitignored) which brings us back to the our current state(mixed content and ssg)

I faced the some problem today and after some research what worked for me was I deleted all the current

2020-03-25T13:47:20  <batey96_> decoupling content from the static site generator will imply that we set an outgoing webhook on the content repo,create a plugin that will add the content as submodule(during build).Does this simple workflow make sense?.A change triggered from any source will trigger the build system,it means that if we edit content repo directly,a build will ne triggered on the static site generator .

I don't know what the best approach is yet, that's something worth exploring in your proposal and can be nailed down during implementation. A demo probably help you work through the feasibility and etc too.

2020-03-25T15:44:19  <Justin_o> amankumar: I'm not sure what you mean by link, but the infusion-docs site should include documentation for tagged versions and master. Currently it just shows master.

2020-03-25T16:53:43  <amankumar> sir i think we can have infusion 1.5,2.0 option in the navbar and when one is selected it will give the details for the same
2020-03-25T16:53:56  <amankumar> Justin_o
2020-03-25T16:54:13  <amankumar> what your views?
2020-03-25T16:54:43  <Justin_o> amankumar: when you say nav bar which part of the Current UI are you specifically referring to?
2020-03-25T16:55:21  <amankumar> for the infusion docs

2020-03-25T16:58:53  <amankumar> navigation links at the top
2020-03-25T16:59:08  <amankumar> i think it will be much better to be placed there
2020-03-25T17:00:13  <Justin_o> amankumar: thanks.. so some things to think about.  what happens when we have more versions? the other links at the top will also need to point at docs from the version selected, will it be understandable which version those links refer to?

2020-03-25T17:07:37  <amankumar> Justin_o : i mean that we can make a option in the navigation link under which there will be all infusion 1.5,2.0 or the upcoming versions
2020-03-25T17:07:53  <amankumar> which can be selected
2020-03-25T17:11:19  <apshada1> Justin_o: i think it's better to place infusion versions at side bar,  navigation from top may increase confusion between versions
2020-03-25T17:13:19  <amankumar> but i think it would be easy for the users to go to the version directly without scrolling down.
2020-03-25T17:13:58  <Justin_o> amankumar, apshada1: I'm having some trouble visualizing this. If you can explain in detail and provide some mockups in the proposal that would help. Also be aware that the specific implementation will need to go through design with the community, but it's good to have though about this first.
2020-03-25T17:14:50  <amankumar> okay i will be including this in my proposal :)
2020-03-25T17:14:56  <amankumar> thank you.

2020-03-25T20:27:16  <sgithens> cindyli: Well, it turns out the entire URI encoded device payload with every solution ID in win32.json and newlines stripped is 2211 characters, plus like the 30 characters for the rest of URL aren't long enough for the server to get cranky, and thus my command line script to fetch all your possible settings from the cloud based flow manager works
2020-03-25T20:27:56  <cindyli> YAY! we are lucky, sgithens
2020-03-25T20:28:23  <cindyli> however, when more solutions are onboarded, sooner or later we'll hit the limit
2020-03-25T20:29:16  <sgithens> yeah, we'll have to make a post version eventually
2020-03-25T20:29:25  <sachin10101998> gmoss alright. I'd keep that in mind. Also could you look at my draft proposal and suggest changes or improvements that should be made to it.
