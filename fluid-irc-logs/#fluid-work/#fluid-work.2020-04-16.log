2020-04-16T11:11:16  <jhernandez> and yeah, as far as I can tell, we didn't have to include it again
2020-04-16T11:11:28  <stegru> well, no one has complained :)
2020-04-16T11:11:34  <jhernandez> exactly
2020-04-16T11:12:42  <jhernandez> my approach when adding this kind of workarounds is not adding them when I start a new release branch from scratch and see if people complains
2020-04-16T11:12:45  <jhernandez> :P
2020-04-16T11:13:19  <jhernandez> same applies for the workaround in universal to make the language change applied last
2020-04-16T11:13:29  <jhernandez> which is not part of the 1.3.x series
2020-04-16T11:13:36  <jhernandez> and nobody complained about it

2020-04-16T12:54:23  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, do you have a minute?
2020-04-16T12:54:34  <the-t-in-rtf> Still grinding on the failing screen resolution setting in my pull.
2020-04-16T12:54:39  <the-t-in-rtf> could use a second pair of eyes.
2020-04-16T12:55:09  <the-t-in-rtf> here's my windows branch that's paired with the updated universal branch
2020-04-16T12:55:10  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/306/files
2020-04-16T12:55:42  <the-t-in-rtf> what's odd is there are no differences I can see between the test data and the SR entries vs. universal master, but it still fails to set the resolution

2020-04-16T12:56:27  <the-t-in-rtf> If I manually set the resolution in the VM to the expected target, the tests "pass" in that no one checked the starting point, so it really seems like it's just failing to update the resolution
2020-04-16T12:56:31  <the-t-in-rtf> and I have no idea why

2020-04-16T14:21:05  <the-t-in-rtf> well, first, when you say I'm getting it, what do you mean?
2020-04-16T14:21:14  <the-t-in-rtf> You mean you looked at a particular CI run?
2020-04-16T14:21:24  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe that would help us make sure we're even talking about the same thing

2020-04-16T14:22:11  <the-t-in-rtf> cool?

2020-04-16T14:22:36  <jhernandez> I see that settings haven't been set/restored

2020-04-16T14:26:36  <the-t-in-rtf> like there is meant to be timeout handling in the SPI settings handler and there are tests for that
2020-04-16T14:26:51  <the-t-in-rtf> and other times it's just timing based, something takes a little long
2020-04-16T14:27:07  <the-t-in-rtf> There is only one FAIL, and the run completes
2020-04-16T14:27:21  <jhernandez> hmm

2020-04-16T14:28:04  <jhernandez> but can't remember a PR that fails that way every time
2020-04-16T14:28:10  <jhernandez> there should be something
2020-04-16T14:28:12  <the-t-in-rtf> If I manually change the resolution in the VM, the tests "pass"
2020-04-16T14:28:16  <the-t-in-rtf> they really shouldn't
2020-04-16T14:28:26  <the-t-in-rtf> but it's a sign that the setting just isn't being applieid
2020-04-16T14:28:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I know, it's bizarre
2020-04-16T14:28:36  <the-t-in-rtf> which is why I need help
2020-04-16T14:28:52  <the-t-in-rtf> If you look at my pull, I'm not changing anything that should affect that setting
2020-04-16T14:29:57  <the-t-in-rtf> If you want we can jump on a video call and I can show you some side by side comparisons
2020-04-16T14:30:56  <jhernandez> though the unit tests for the screen resolution are passing fine
2020-04-16T14:31:41  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, it's just the acceptance tests that fail.
2020-04-16T14:32:12  <the-t-in-rtf> and I have tried comparing my work a dozen ways with various working setups, like Antranig's "sanity" branch
2020-04-16T14:32:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I can't find anything that would explain this
2020-04-16T14:33:53  <the-t-in-rtf> let me try running gpii.js from my VM and keying in as "elmer"
2020-04-16T14:34:14  <the-t-in-rtf> just to confirm whether it's working in some other way than staring at the same test runs again
2020-04-16T14:35:01  <jhernandez> is it always in the same test?
2020-04-16T14:35:06  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: danayo)
2020-04-16T14:37:09  <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2020-04-16T14:37:19  <the-t-in-rtf> always when testing os_win with the default matchmaker
2020-04-16T14:37:27  <jhernandez> yeah, that one
2020-04-16T14:38:23  <the-t-in-rtf> holy crap!
2020-04-16T14:38:28  <the-t-in-rtf> logging in as elmer works
2020-04-16T14:38:57  <jhernandez> yeah, the screen resolution change is working
2020-04-16T14:39:36  <jhernandez> so, you're getting exactly the same failure locally, right?
2020-04-16T14:39:42  <jhernandez> (as in CI, I mean)
2020-04-16T14:40:02  <jhernandez> as a test, can you not apply screen-dpi in os_win?
2020-04-16T14:40:23  <the-t-in-rtf> sure thing
2020-04-16T14:40:30  <the-t-in-rtf> and thanks for looking into it with me
2020-04-16T14:40:36  <jhernandez> you'd need to update both the os_win prefset and the testDef
2020-04-16T14:41:22  <jhernandez> tests/data/preferences/os_win.json5 and tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js
2020-04-16T14:41:26  <jhernandez> just remove the dpi thing
2020-04-16T14:41:42  <jhernandez> and let's see if that makes it pass
2020-04-16T14:43:11  <the-t-in-rtf> yup, running now
2020-04-16T14:47:15  <jhernandez> no party?
2020-04-16T14:50:26  <the-t-in-rtf> still churning
2020-04-16T14:50:37  <jhernandez> ok ok
2020-04-16T14:50:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I ran all the tests as there are some prep steps I don't like to skip out of paranoia
2020-04-16T14:50:50  <jhernandez> now on call
2020-04-16T14:51:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I often am twiddling the SR itself, which requires extra prep
2020-04-16T14:51:05  <the-t-in-rtf> cool
2020-04-16T14:51:10  <jhernandez> but I'm around
2020-04-16T14:51:11  <the-t-in-rtf> will let you know
2020-04-16T14:51:14  <jhernandez> cool
2020-04-16T14:51:29  <the-t-in-rtf> hope it's one of those where someone is double-booked and everyone else leaves silently
2020-04-16T14:52:12  <the-t-in-rtf> same failure
2020-04-16T14:52:24  <jhernandez> ok, that's weird
2020-04-16T14:52:30  <jhernandez> that I failed
2020-04-16T14:52:37  <jhernandez> s/I/It
2020-04-16T14:53:56  <jhernandez> I'm going over your changes in universal in case I can spot anything
2020-04-16T14:54:04  <the-t-in-rtf> Trying with a little extra voodoo, running npm postinstall from the edited gpii-universal
2020-04-16T14:54:09  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
2020-04-16T14:57:40  <jhernandez> hmmm
2020-04-16T14:57:48  <jhernandez> ok ok
2020-04-16T14:57:54  <the-t-in-rtf> nope, same failure
2020-04-16T14:58:04  <jhernandez> now I have to pay some attention to the call
2020-04-16T14:58:07  <jhernandez> he's sharing the screen
2020-04-16T14:58:12  <the-t-in-rtf> gotta run out for a minute, let me know if you think of anything else
2020-04-16T14:58:15  <jhernandez> but I'll take a look at your changes
2020-04-16T14:58:17  <jhernandez> sure
2020-04-16T14:58:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yup, I'm done anyway
2020-04-16T14:58:23  <jhernandez> cool
2020-04-16T14:58:30  <jhernandez> enjoy the rest of the day
2020-04-16T14:58:33  <the-t-in-rtf> we can continue async on chat as and when we each have a moment
2020-04-16T14:58:43  <jhernandez> and have fun with your son ;)
2020-04-16T14:58:46  <the-t-in-rtf> good luck with the call
2020-04-16T14:58:47  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
2020-04-16T14:58:49  <the-t-in-rtf> you too!

2020-04-16T15:25:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon4, gtirloni: I've been looking into https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6488
2020-04-16T15:25:43  <Justin_o> I thought it was going to be an easy fix, but sadly it's taken longer than I would have liked. However, I'm close to having a fix in place
2020-04-16T15:26:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon4: I've also filed a related JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6492
2020-04-16T15:31:36  <Bosmon4> Justin_o - thanks, it's a very interesting investigation
2020-04-16T15:31:49  <Bosmon4> It does indeed seem as if it's impossible to simulate a tab press, doesn't it
2020-04-16T15:32:02  <Bosmon4> I seem to vaguely remember the-t-in-rtf running into such a thing before

2020-04-16T20:16:24  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I need to update a dependency in infusion (grunt-contrib-compress) because the current version we're using is giving me some trouble with dependencies inside a container. The newest version works fine (container builds, infusion passes all tests, etc). What's the best way to go about updating this dependency? Just a PR? Should I take the time to update all other dependencies as well?
2020-04-16T20:17:27  <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, please to the PR.. if you can update other dependencies that would be great. Although I think upgrading jQuery might cause an issue. I haven't really looked into it though.
2020-04-16T20:20:19  <gtirloni> Justin_o: cool, i'll do it. thanks!
