2019-02-14T13:18:04  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey there
2019-02-14T13:19:13  <jhernandez> I see that you're in a MIITIN' right now, but would like to ask you about this pr: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/740
2019-02-14T13:20:50  <jhernandez> I hit that issue when testing the QS button for the mouse settings - planned for 1.1
2019-02-14T13:21:22  <jhernandez> Danail_Dido: hey
2019-02-14T13:22:10  <jhernandez> I've been taking a closer look at the mouse settings - and yes, there's some work that needs to be done for it to work fine
2019-02-14T13:23:22  <jhernandez> javjarfer[m] and I are already working on identifying the different sources of problems
2019-02-14T13:26:14  <Danail_Dido> Thanks jhernandez , keep my updated, and if you need any changes on my part just let me know.
2019-02-14T13:26:34  <Danail_Dido> stegru, that was a late morning, any time for me to the rest of the day? :-D
2019-02-14T13:28:02  <stegru> ah Danail_Dido - I forgot about you.. I'll get back in about half hour, after my current call is over
2019-02-14T13:28:24  <Danail_Dido> Great, I'm waiting, just ping me when you are ready.

2019-02-14T13:40:54  <Danail_Dido> That sounds great :-D
2019-02-14T13:42:24  <jhernandez> cindyli: 你好
2019-02-14T13:43:12  <cindyli> 早上好，jhernandez
2019-02-14T13:43:45  <jhernandez> :)
2019-02-14T13:43:53  <jhernandez> got a question for you
2019-02-14T13:44:00  <cindyli> sure
2019-02-14T13:44:55  <jhernandez> regarding https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/734
2019-02-14T13:46:02  <jhernandez> it's fine but, I've accidentally keyed-in with the same user that was actually keyed-in and it did all the mumbo jumbo
2019-02-14T13:46:23  <cindyli> key out and key back in?
2019-02-14T13:46:29  <jhernandez> yup
2019-02-14T13:46:49  <cindyli> you expect the key-out should not happen for the same user?
2019-02-14T13:47:07  <jhernandez> and when you have a language setting and high contrast theme enabled, it's a bummer
2019-02-14T13:47:30  <jhernandez> too many explorer restarts for "nothing"?
2019-02-14T13:47:45  <cindyli> jhernandez: how do you key in the same user without an explicit key out?
2019-02-14T13:48:01  <cindyli> via http login endpoint?
2019-02-14T13:48:13  <jhernandez> yeah, I would expect that, if the user is already keyed-in, do nothing
2019-02-14T13:48:16  <jhernandez> cindyli: yes
2019-02-14T13:48:48  <jhernandez> it's true that a user with a USB key shouldn't hit this use case ever
2019-02-14T13:49:32  <cindyli> http endpoints on localhost will be removed from the production config soon. but i guess another possible way to key in without a key out is to use gpii-app key-in menu
2019-02-14T13:49:54  <cindyli> i can make the change to not key out for the same user. Bosmon, what do you think?
2019-02-14T13:50:03  <jhernandez> but I was wondering whether we could prevent us from that
2019-02-14T13:50:09  <jhernandez> yeah, not sure what's best here
2019-02-14T13:50:24  <jhernandez> let's wait for Bosmon's advice
2019-02-14T13:50:27  <cindyli> ok
2019-02-14T13:50:57  <jhernandez> I need to leave now, but will be back in about an hour
2019-02-14T13:51:00  <jhernandez> FYI
2019-02-14T13:51:12  <cindyli> ok. thanks for letting me know
2019-02-14T13:51:13  <jhernandez> oh, and thanks cindyli!!

2019-02-14T16:07:08  <simonjb> hi Bosmon, quick question: is the Infusion change applier synchronous? I want to test an invoker that might change model state, but I want to test a case where it should leave the model alone -- if I check the model after calling the invoker, can I be sure that any changes that might have been made have been made?
2019-02-14T16:07:27  <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, it is synchronous
2019-02-14T16:07:35  <simonjb> awesome, thanks!

2019-02-14T16:15:29  <stegru> no problem
2019-02-14T16:15:34  <jhernandez> ACK received
2019-02-14T16:15:36  <cindyli> sure
2019-02-14T16:15:37  <jhernandez> :)
2019-02-14T16:17:20  <cindyli> Bosmon: Sandra has scheduled a meeting tomorrow morning 8AM EST to talk about this: "Cont'd - Alternate strategy for key-in discussion". we should let her know if we will have the call today
2019-02-14T16:17:46  <Bosmon> cindyli - that is the meeting where we will report to Gregg on any reflections from this meeting :)
2019-02-14T16:17:52  <cindyli> ah i see
2019-02-14T16:18:01  <cindyli> ok, we do need a call today

2019-02-14T17:19:33  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: does anyone have experience debugging promises on a node server in VSCode? my breakpoints in the resolve/error callbacks aren't getting hit
2019-02-14T17:19:54  <gmoss> *callbacks which are args for the then() function
2019-02-14T17:20:43  <Bosmon> gmoss - I don't, I always just use the chrome inspector
2019-02-14T17:20:54  <gmoss> Bosmon: even for server-side code?
2019-02-14T17:21:02  <Bosmon> gmoss especially for server-side code!
2019-02-14T17:21:07  <gmoss> Bosmon: I would love to learn how!
2019-02-14T17:21:17  <Bosmon> https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/
2019-02-14T17:21:22  <Bosmon> It is super-easy
2019-02-14T17:21:35  <gmoss> Bosmon: amazing, thank you! I'll check this out and give it a shot :)
2019-02-14T17:21:46  <Bosmon>  --inspect-brk is the normal scheme
2019-02-14T17:21:47  <gmoss> SO searches were not bearing any fruit
2019-02-14T17:22:04  <Bosmon> You then just point Chrome to chrome://inspect and any local processes will show up automatically
2019-02-14T17:22:23  <Bosmon> cindyli, jhernandez, stegru - does pretty soon work?
2019-02-14T17:23:58  <jhernandez> sure
2019-02-14T17:24:59  <jhernandez> if "pretty soon" means "within the next hour and a half/two hours"
2019-02-14T17:25:01  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-14T17:25:14  <Bosmon> I was thinking more like within the next 10 minutes : p
2019-02-14T17:25:19  <jhernandez> in Spain that is possible
2019-02-14T17:25:20  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-14T17:26:43  <cindyli> possible in Canada too
2019-02-14T17:27:15  <Bosmon> ok great
