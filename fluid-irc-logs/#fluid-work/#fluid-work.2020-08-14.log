2020-08-14T14:45:42  <greatislander> Hi gtirloni, I have a question for you if you are available
2020-08-14T14:46:43  <gtirloni> sure
2020-08-14T14:47:21  <greatislander> I need to set a couple of non-secret environment variables and make them available to the build process for deploying the directory
2020-08-14T14:48:03  <greatislander> would the best place to do that be here? https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml#L8
2020-08-14T14:48:35  <gtirloni> yeah, that would map the env vars from the OS environment into the container.. so yes, you need to add them there
2020-08-14T14:48:46  <gtirloni> then on the server there's a deploy.env files with the actual values
2020-08-14T14:48:49  <greatislander> okay perfect. and if I need environment-specific ones?
2020-08-14T14:49:05  <greatislander> is it possible to add them to stack_<env>.yml?
2020-08-14T14:49:46  <gtirloni> the way it's right now, you'd need to just add the mapping to the docker-compose and then edit the deploy.env for each environment on the server itself, to add the values
2020-08-14T14:49:55  <gtirloni> (i can add them to the deploy.env files if you want)
2020-08-14T14:50:01  <greatislander> ah, okay
2020-08-14T14:50:23  <greatislander> so what we need is environment variables like this:
2020-08-14T14:50:32  <greatislander> MAP_ASSETS_BASE_URL="https://directory.platform.coop"
2020-08-14T14:50:40  <gtirloni> you could add the actual values to the docker-compose file if you want.. it's just that we're using the deploy.env files for everything else
2020-08-14T14:50:45  <greatislander> and for dev, MAP_ASSETS_BASE_URL="https://dev.directory.platform.coop"
2020-08-14T14:51:05  <gtirloni> got it, yeah, just add the mapping to the docker-compose and i can edit the deploy.env's
2020-08-14T14:51:42  <greatislander> like this?
2020-08-14T14:51:45  <greatislander> ```
2020-08-14T14:51:45  <greatislander> - MAP_ASSETS_BASE_URL=${MAP_ASSETS_BASE_URL}
2020-08-14T14:51:45  <greatislander> ```
2020-08-14T14:51:50  <gtirloni> yep!
2020-08-14T14:52:10  <greatislander> great, committing that now
2020-08-14T14:52:22  <gtirloni> is that the only env var you need to add?
2020-08-14T14:52:41  <greatislander> yes, the other one is consistent between environments so I added it directly to docker-compose.yml
2020-08-14T14:52:46  <greatislander> https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml#L15
2020-08-14T14:53:03  <gtirloni> ok
2020-08-14T14:53:12  <gtirloni> i've edited the deploy.env's for each env and added that
2020-08-14T14:53:18  <greatislander> great!
2020-08-14T14:53:54  <greatislander> gonna see if the deploy works now :)_
2020-08-14T14:53:58  <gtirloni> cool!
2020-08-14T14:55:03  <greatislander> hmm, didn't work
2020-08-14T14:55:12  <greatislander> looks like that one I added to docker-compose wasn't picked up
2020-08-14T14:55:31  <greatislander> can you try editing the .env file and add this? https://github.com/platform-coop-toolkit/coop-map-directory-index/blob/dev/docker-compose.yml#L15
2020-08-14T14:55:40  <greatislander> and then I'll try running the deploy again gtirloni?
2020-08-14T14:56:19  <gtirloni> ok, one sec
2020-08-14T14:57:00  <gtirloni> added
2020-08-14T14:59:54  <gtirloni> the way we're managing secrets isn't ideal :( ... there's deploy.env, .env files, secrets in github.. but well, it's all going to move somewhere soon so not worth messing with it, i think
2020-08-14T15:00:04  <greatislander> okay that worked
2020-08-14T15:00:12  <greatislander> who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-08-14T15:00:17  <greatislander> thanks gio!
2020-08-14T15:00:25  <gtirloni> yw
2020-08-14T16:05:02  <jhung> dogeman I've added a review. I'm not done reviewing and will come back to it later in the day. Thanks!
2020-08-14T16:08:53  <dogeman> thanks jhung. I'll look into it.
2020-08-14T16:09:14  <jhung> Thanks!
