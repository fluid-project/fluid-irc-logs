2020-09-23T12:39:16  <Justin_o> greatislander: I merged https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1007 thanks for the improvement
2020-09-23T12:41:36  <greatislander> Thanks Justin_o!
2020-09-23T12:43:47  <greatislander> Justin_o I'm wondering if I can get permissions to triage some issues on the Fluid Project JIRA. Specifically jhung and I are working on the FLOE website and there's some issues in the backlog I'd like to close/assign etc. (On this list:
2020-09-23T12:43:48  <greatislander> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-585?jql=project%20%3D%20FLOE%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%2C%20%22Pull%20Request%22)%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22FLOE%20Website%22)
2020-09-23T12:44:19  <Justin_o> greatislander: should just take a couple minutes
2020-09-23T12:44:24  <greatislander> thanks!
2020-09-23T12:45:04  <Justin_o> greatislander: please check now, not sure if you'll need to log out first
2020-09-23T12:46:16  <greatislander> looks like I'm good now, thanks Justin_o
2020-09-23T12:46:28  <Justin_o> greatislander: np

2020-09-23T14:50:53  <cindyli> colinclark, philip: when you have time, can you take a look at my pull request that adds LICENSE.md to covid-assessment-centres repo - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/pull/2. thanks
2020-09-23T15:12:22  <colinclark> i think i just did
2020-09-23T15:12:30  <colinclark> with a suggestion on perhaps how to word it
2020-09-23T15:18:05  <Bosmon> colinclark, cindyli1 and all - just a wrinkle about the data licensing issue
2020-09-23T15:18:10  <colinclark> ah?
2020-09-23T15:18:15  <Bosmon> colinclark asked yesterday about whether we could keep the data separate
2020-09-23T15:18:26  <Bosmon> One of the wrinkles is that the data is, in effect, already irretrievably mixed up
2020-09-23T15:18:30  <colinclark> right
2020-09-23T15:18:35  <colinclark> Which I noted was fine
2020-09-23T15:18:42  <Bosmon> Given the data that we consider "our own" has already incorporated some of the ODS data
2020-09-23T15:18:42  <colinclark> I was just pursuing a certain kind of ideal
2020-09-23T15:18:44  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-09-23T15:18:46  <colinclark> that’s fine
2020-09-23T15:18:49  <Bosmon> ok
2020-09-23T15:19:10  <colinclark> Presumably some day your tooling may help people be very clear about which parts of mixed data sets are attributable to which sources
2020-09-23T15:19:15  <Bosmon> I mean, when we have our final brilliant data provenance system, we'll be able to use "daff" or something similar to determine data provenance on a cell by cell basis : P
2020-09-23T15:19:20  <Bosmon> snap :)
2020-09-23T15:19:25  <colinclark> :)
2020-09-23T15:19:36  <colinclark> there’s nothing in the OGL-O that prevents us from redistributing their data and ours under CC-BY
2020-09-23T15:20:11  <colinclark> which is great
2020-09-23T15:20:24  <colinclark> we just have to be sure to attribute them according to the license’s terms
2020-09-23T15:27:01  <Bosmon> That's cool
2020-09-23T15:27:23  <Bosmon> I guess our "dynamic repository spawning thing" will also have to take care to accumulate any licences too

2020-09-23T18:54:43  <cindyli> Justin_o: i ran into a problem with using UIO toc + syllable settings. If a heading has one or more special chars, this combined setting will get into an infinite loop. i created a JIRA for it - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6554
