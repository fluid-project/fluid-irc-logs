2019-02-28T14:41:46  <cindyli> jhernandez: the issue with gpii-app not applying high contrast theme is because the dynamic device reporter didn't return "com.microsoft.windows.highContrast" as an installed solution.
2019-02-28T14:42:57  <cindyli> as a test, i tried switching gpii-app to use the dev config - gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json5, which uses the static device reporter, applying high contrast is fine
2019-02-28T14:43:14  <jhernandez> cindyli: really?
2019-02-28T14:43:17  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-02-28T14:43:30  <jhernandez> I've been dealing with an installer issue
2019-02-28T14:43:40  <jhernandez> I'll check later if I get the same here
2019-02-28T14:44:15  <cindyli> ok
2019-02-28T14:46:38  <cindyli> just for your reference, the solution list returned by the dynamic device reporter - https://pastebin.com/rSzKsZPw

2019-02-28T15:30:24  * jhernandez facepalm
2019-02-28T15:31:35  <jhernandez> according to this (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6215-L6223) we expect to find NVDA to tell that highContrast is installed
2019-02-28T15:31:37  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-28T15:31:57  <jhernandez> looks like a wrong merge conflict
2019-02-28T15:32:17  <jhernandez> that wasn't properly resolved
2019-02-28T15:32:27  * jhernandez digging a bit
2019-02-28T15:33:00  <jhernandez> ok, coming from this commit https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/2742421e3915d1997093dfa63e5f5a0cc7da55f5
2019-02-28T15:33:27  <jhernandez> I will provide a pr to fix that ASAP
2019-02-28T15:34:03  <jhernandez> I will also see if there are more solutions affected by that conflict resolution
2019-02-28T15:34:36  <cindyli> great!
