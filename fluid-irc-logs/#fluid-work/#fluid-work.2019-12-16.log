2019-12-16T14:07:57  <Bosmon2> cindyli - great news, with your latest fix I just successfully ran the development tests for FlowManager with the FLUID-6145 branch :)
2019-12-16T14:08:11  <cindyli> YAY!
2019-12-16T14:08:20  <Bosmon2> Justin_o - I don't know if you saw on Friday, but I issued a fix for your resourceLoader callback issue into FLUID-6145
2019-12-16T14:08:33  *** Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2019-12-16T14:10:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, I did see that. I pulled down your code but the example still isn't running for me. It might be some other update I need to do for the prefs framework though. I haven't had a chance to look into it yet. I'll spend a few minutes to check that soon. I'll be taking a sick day today though, so will be offline in about 20 min after I tie up some tasks I need to get done for today.
2019-12-16T14:10:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - no worries, sorry you are not well
2019-12-16T14:10:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. been fighting a cold for the past week, but it's not going away ;(
2019-12-16T14:11:08  <Bosmon> Justin_o - we have the same one
2019-12-16T14:11:25  <Bosmon> I guess it must be cursing the entire world
2019-12-16T14:11:33  <Bosmon> I really wonder why it doesn't get better
2019-12-16T14:12:29  <Justin_o> :( I hope you're getting better
2019-12-16T14:21:39  <the-t-in-rtf> Even NPM is sick.

2019-12-16T14:24:13  <Justin_o> lol thanks.. I was just installing something from npm, I hope I didn't infect it
2019-12-16T14:24:59  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm experiencing issues npm installing, it's clearly related
2019-12-16T14:25:02  <gmoss> :P
2019-12-16T14:25:12  <Justin_o> oh no
2019-12-16T14:27:25  <the-t-in-rtf> my advice is to subscribe for updates and walk to your favourite coffee spot
2019-12-16T14:27:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, what else can you do?

2019-12-16T15:20:34  <gmoss> Bosmon: I've updated fluid-couch-config to use the latest dev release of infusion, it seems to solve the error message you were getting when looking into SJRK-318
2019-12-16T15:21:09  <gmoss> Bosmon: I also made a few other little changes like linting and copyright dates which will clutter up the review process a little
2019-12-16T15:21:29  <Bosmon> gmoss - that's awesome, thanks
2019-12-16T15:21:32  <Bosmon> I'll update and retest
2019-12-16T15:23:41  <Bosmon> Ah, looks like your SJRK pull is still bound to waharnum's fork?

2019-12-16T15:23:58  <gmoss> Bosmon: btw, I don't think I understand the comments you've left on SJRK-318 and my SJRK-41 PR. The values at the options you highlighted are only ever read, iirc.
2019-12-16T15:24:16  <gmoss> Bosmon: yes, I've just updated that in my local branch (pointed to my master) and was preparing to commit & push
2019-12-16T15:25:38  <Bosmon> gmoss - well your initial use of options.dbDocuments looks like a read, but in practice you only read the value in order to write to it : P
2019-12-16T15:25:52  <Bosmon> I meant, that there seem to be no other readers of the option than the functions which put values there
2019-12-16T15:26:03  <Bosmon> So it doesn't seem clear why the documents are in options at all
2019-12-16T15:27:25  <the-t-in-rtf> npm is back
2019-12-16T15:28:31  <gmoss> Bosmon: once they're read from dbDocuments, those values are then written to the db if the document in question either doesn't exist or has changed from the spec/schema defined in the dbDocuments option
2019-12-16T15:28:40  <gmoss> there shouldn't be any writing back to that option
2019-12-16T15:29:47  <Bosmon> gmoss - oh, I see... the documents were meant to be put there by the overrider of fluid.couchConfig?
2019-12-16T15:29:56  <Bosmon> So the writing back to the option was a bug
2019-12-16T15:29:59  <gmoss> Bosmon: that's correct
2019-12-16T15:30:15  <gmoss> which I believe I've solved by making a deep copy
2019-12-16T15:30:22  <Bosmon> ok, got it
2019-12-16T15:30:24  <Bosmon> Cheers
2019-12-16T15:30:26  <gmoss> :)
2019-12-16T15:30:44  <gmoss> (at least I hope I've solved it!)
2019-12-16T15:31:44  <gmoss> Bosmon: thanks for looking into SJRK-318 btw, I hope it's an easy fix
2019-12-16T15:33:10  <Bosmon> gmoss - I hope so too - the reported symptoms are frankly bizarre : P
2019-12-16T15:33:50  <gmoss> Bosmon: just a bit! I hope it's something in my code and not the prefs framework :O
2019-12-16T15:34:38  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@198.178.118.18> has quit IRC ()
2019-12-16T15:36:05  <Bosmon> gmoss ok cool, I am now getting SUCCESS from dbSetup...
2019-12-16T15:36:13  <gmoss> Bosmon: excellent
2019-12-16T15:50:17  <Bosmon> gmoss - ok, I can reproduce your issue
2019-12-16T15:50:44  <Bosmon> gmoss - in terms of general performance concerns, I am seeing that the way that gpii-binder is currently working/is being integrated, it involves creating 10 binder components for every renderer component
2019-12-16T15:52:09  <gmoss> Bosmon: do you think that could be why it's got so bad so suddenly?
2019-12-16T15:52:13  <Bosmon> Each of your components has a templateManager which then has a templateLoader, a templateRenderer with a bunch of helpers
2019-12-16T15:52:45  <Bosmon> gmoss - probably not, I remember your component tree always being this way
2019-12-16T15:53:01  <gmoss> Bosmon: ah yes, that one is something we've been meaning to address. there's a Jira for that: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-262
2019-12-16T15:53:45  <gmoss> Bosmon: brb coffee time
2019-12-16T15:54:36  <Bosmon> gmoss - ok yes, fascinating bug with the ToC resourceLoading which is almost certainly mine .....
2019-12-16T16:07:28  <gmoss> Bosmon: It sure is interesting :)

2019-12-16T17:18:01  <gmoss> @cindyli unrelated to the SJRK-255 work, would you be able to give this one a quick review? super simple update, I don't expect it to conflict with SJRK-255: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/52
2019-12-16T17:18:13  <Bosmon> gmoss, Justin_o - it looks like the ToC issue is just the one that Justin was talking about on Thursday
2019-12-16T17:18:14  <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6145/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L467
2019-12-16T17:18:34  <Bosmon> At this site we have a plain option which depends on a value which may be available asynchronously
2019-12-16T17:18:39  <Bosmon> Which isn't currently supported
2019-12-16T17:18:53  <Bosmon> This raises the issue of why the ToC ever renders correclty at all, about which I have my suspicions
2019-12-16T17:18:59  <Bosmon> I notice that there is this helpful comment here:
2019-12-16T17:19:11  <Bosmon> "            // TODO: When FLUID-6312 and FLUID-6300 are addressed, make sure that this message loader is updated when
2019-12-16T17:20:13  <Bosmon> I see that FLUID-6300 is closed despite https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/937 still being open
2019-12-16T17:20:36  <Bosmon> I was explaining to Justin_o that the "strings" approach to sourcing message bundles isn't really workable
2019-12-16T17:21:41  <Bosmon> My suspicion about why this ever renders correctly is that because the string hash actually ultimately ends up inside a MessageResolver, it is sometimes able to win this race: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6145/src/framework/core/js/MessageResolver.js#L85
2019-12-16T17:22:02  <Bosmon> And sometimes it isn't ....
2019-12-16T17:22:44  <Bosmon> hmm...........

2019-12-16T17:23:19  <Bosmon> That can't be the reason, since it seems we do indeed boil on onMessagesLoaded here: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6145/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L485
2019-12-16T17:24:41  <Bosmon> OK, so I'm back to investigating why this doesn't work, rather than why it does .....

2019-12-16T17:33:35  <Bosmon> gmoss - well it should be addressed, once we actually resolve this bug : P
2019-12-16T17:33:45  <gmoss> Bosmon: fair enough :)
2019-12-16T17:33:48  <Bosmon> Although the comment in the impl there still needs to be addressed
2019-12-16T17:38:37  <Bosmon> Argh, now I see it.... it is the most grotty race imaginable: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6145/src/framework/core/js/ResourceLoader.js#L817
2019-12-16T17:39:06  <Bosmon> If we win the race, a normal resource entry gets dumped into resources
2019-12-16T17:39:12  <Bosmon> If we lose it, we get the promise structure
2019-12-16T17:39:33  <Bosmon> There still remains the mystery of why we ever lose the race, given that ToC boils on resourcesLoaded
