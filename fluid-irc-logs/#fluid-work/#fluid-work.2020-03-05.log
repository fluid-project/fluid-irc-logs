2020-03-05T18:28:43  <arteevraina[m]> Hi i want to contribute to this org. May i know the priority of the projects.
2020-03-05T18:31:14  <Justin_o> arteevraina[m]: I assume you are talking about GSoC. Is that correct? and not sure what you mean by priority of projects.
2020-03-05T18:33:08  <gmoss> arteevraina[m]: if you haven't checked out our list of projects yet, I recommend you do so: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/m/view-rendered-page.action?abstractPageId=187891727
2020-03-05T18:33:08  <gmoss> There is a lot of information on that page and on other pages linked from it, so I definitely recommend reading it :)
2020-03-05T18:40:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon, Bosmon2: this is going to be a bit of a distraction from the current meeting, but when yo have a chance to think about it. I've been puzzling over the portBinding in UIO+ and seeing if we can refactor it as a generalized system to handle web sockets both on the server and client. Mainly for reducing potential race conditions about model changes causing infinite loops.
2020-03-05T18:41:15  <Justin_o> What I've also been wondering is why we have RemoteModel, DataSource, and what is currently called PortBinding in UIO+.
2020-03-05T18:41:22  <Justin_o> I wrote this up to compare them.
2020-03-05T18:41:32  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/j5k9GQSr/
2020-03-05T18:43:48  <Justin_o> So I'm thinking that the port binding is really just a wrapper around the messaging protocol to handle sending and waiting for receipts. Generalization is hard though because of the differences in the various messaging protocols like ports vs websockets. But we might be able to do something to rationalize the mapping and sending receiving of receipts, which seems the most important parts.
2020-03-05T18:45:13  <Justin_o> The issue of using dataSource and remoteModel with the web socket  used between UIO+ and morphic is that the implementation is all outgoing writes. UIO+ writes to morphic, morphic writes to UIO+, but the dataSource and RemoteModel components both work by only sending out writes and reads. So they don't handle half of the situation.

2020-03-05T19:59:01  <Justin_o> amankumar: okay, what would you like to know about that. Also have you gotten an instance of the current one up and running?
