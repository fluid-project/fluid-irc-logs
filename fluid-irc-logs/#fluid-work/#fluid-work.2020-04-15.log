2020-04-15T14:48:36  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: any objections to me adding default community health files for the fluid-project and inclusive-design GitHub orgs. https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file
2020-04-15T14:49:05  <Justin_o> They can be overridden within a specific repo, but will at least provide us with some coverage by default.
2020-04-15T14:50:00  <Justin_o> I haven't been able to fully test the issue templates, because they currently aren't working at the account level... but the hope is that they would also get projects that use GitHub Issues setup easier and more consistently.
2020-04-15T14:51:12  <Justin_o> I'm thinking of adding the following files: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, Issue templates, SECURITY.md and SUPPORT.md

2020-04-15T14:59:18  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks.. I guess I'll wait till after stand up to see if there are any objections and if not I'll go for it.
2020-04-15T15:01:02  <greatislander> Justin_o that would be great!
2020-04-15T15:01:32  <Justin_o> gtirloni: also I've been planning to sort through our repos and fix some things up related to issue tracking. Basically we've run into some cases where a project has issues filed in both JIRA and GitHub Issues. We want to settle on one or the other on project by project basis. That might mean migrating from GitHub Issues to JIRA in some cases and vice-versa in others.

2020-04-15T16:57:49  <colinclark> but somehow Darcie’s uploading of a new video to YouTube for her business at the same time as me on Zoom was enough to do it
2020-04-15T16:59:12  <gtirloni> colinclark: xDSL?
2020-04-15T16:59:17  <colinclark> cable
2020-04-15T16:59:20  <gtirloni> ah
2020-04-15T16:59:58  <gtirloni> you might try enabling QoS in your router so uploads get throttled, if rogers allows access
2020-04-15T17:00:03  <jhernandez> colinclark: Darcie's business go first!!! :P
2020-04-15T17:00:09  <jhernandez> gtirloni: !!!
2020-04-15T17:00:14  <gtirloni> jhernandez: hey hey :)
2020-04-15T17:00:15  <colinclark> jhernandez: seriously
2020-04-15T17:00:25  <colinclark> i actually did almost set QoS to prioritize Darcie’s uploads first
2020-04-15T17:00:36  <gtirloni> lol
2020-04-15T17:00:39  <colinclark> in that if she’s giving a Zoom yoga class and it crashes, she’s immediately having to refund her clients
2020-04-15T17:00:44  <jhernandez> gtirloni: soooo nice to you see around again :)
2020-04-15T17:00:50  <colinclark> whereas I can tether to my phone and chat on IRC instead :)
2020-04-15T17:00:52  <gtirloni> jhernandez: nice to see you too :)
2020-04-15T17:00:57  <colinclark> jhernandez: GTIRLONI IS BACK!
2020-04-15T17:01:01  <jhernandez> colinclark: then I wasn't wrong about that :P
2020-04-15T17:01:07  <jhernandez> can't believe my eyes!!
2020-04-15T17:01:10  <jhernandez> totally back?!

2020-04-15T19:34:31  <Teddy___> greatislander: cindyli: Justin_o: michelled: We count check-in anyone?
2020-04-15T19:34:41  <greatislander> It's in a half an hour, right?
2020-04-15T19:34:48  <cindyli> Teddy___: i thought it's at 4
2020-04-15T19:34:56  <cindyli> 4 eastern i mean
2020-04-15T19:34:56  <greatislander> Yeah, it's 3:35
2020-04-15T19:35:00  <greatislander> eastern
2020-04-15T19:35:04  <greatislander> so it's in 25 minutes :)
2020-04-15T19:35:18  <Teddy___> Oh thats right, my bad everyone
2020-04-15T19:35:31  <Teddy___> we changed the date AS WELL as the time for the meeting
2020-04-15T19:35:38  <greatislander> yep
2020-04-15T19:35:42  <Teddy___> makes sense
2020-04-15T19:36:12  <cindyli> it's cuz community meetings on Wednesdays end at 4 eastern

2020-04-15T20:12:44  <gmoss> ping Justin_o
2020-04-15T20:13:12  <Justin_o> gmoss: hello
2020-04-15T20:13:58  <gmoss> do you know, off hand, if there's a model transformation function that I can use to take multiple other models and consolidate them to a single key on another model?
2020-04-15T20:14:06  <gmoss> *another model key
2020-04-15T20:14:53  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.120.220.187> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-04-15T20:14:54  <Justin_o> gmoss: you want to nest them under a single key in the other model?
2020-04-15T20:14:56  <gmoss> e.g. i have model data on three components, and I want to track all changes to any of them using a model relay that compiles the values of all of three models to another key
2020-04-15T20:14:59  <gmoss> yes
2020-04-15T20:15:12  <Justin_o> I think you could probably use the valuemapper for that
2020-04-15T20:15:17  <Justin_o> what's the use case?
2020-04-15T20:15:35  <gmoss> okay, I'll take a look at it :) the use case is to replace the function/invoker we were looking at earlier with a model relay
2020-04-15T20:15:48  <gmoss> which should alleviate timing issues and be a little tidier
2020-04-15T20:23:02  <gmoss> clarifying a little more: I want to be able to have block models relayed into the story model `content` key automatically and vice versa
2020-04-15T20:23:21  <gmoss> the "vice versa" part might require the use of a free transfortm
2020-04-15T20:24:20  <Justin_o> you want to mode a relay between modelA: {a: "a"} and modelB: { collection: {a: "a"}}
2020-04-15T20:24:25  <Justin_o> something like that?
2020-04-15T20:32:46  *** batey96_ <batey96_!uid429003@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-mlrkkjayajxuoflf> has quit IRC (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
2020-04-15T20:32:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah something like that.  let's say modelA: {a: "a"} and modelB: {b: "b"}, I want any change to a and b to update modelC: {c: [a: "a", b: "b"]}
2020-04-15T20:33:10  <gmoss> *any change to a or b
2020-04-15T20:33:36  <Justin_o> gmoss: where is model c?
2020-04-15T20:33:56  <gmoss> A and B represent block models, C represents story model
2020-04-15T20:34:20  <Justin_o> gmoss: I think it's just a straight model relay to the paths you want
2020-04-15T20:34:32  <gmoss> Justin_o: like a short-form relay?
2020-04-15T20:34:39  <Justin_o> gmoss: but if it's just the change event, I think you can bind a listener to trigger on the change of multiple model paths
2020-04-15T20:34:40  <gmoss> so each block has a reference to the story model?
2020-04-15T20:35:05  <Justin_o> gmoss: possibly I'm not sure which direction makes most sense
2020-04-15T20:35:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: I have a couple of things to consider, at least. thanks for the help so far :)
2020-04-15T20:35:39  <Justin_o> gmoss: np
