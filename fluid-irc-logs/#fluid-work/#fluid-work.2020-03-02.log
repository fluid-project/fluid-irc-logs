2020-03-02T09:28:31  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @batey96.  Welcome.
2020-03-02T09:28:39  <the-t-in-rtf> There is no slack channel for these discussions.
2020-03-02T09:28:45  <the-t-in-rtf> We use IRC, and you're already there!
2020-03-02T09:29:16  <the-t-in-rtf> The mentors for those projects are in North America, and will probably be coming online in around four and a half hours.
2020-03-02T09:29:27  <batey96> ok the-t-in-rtf thanks i appreciate for the response.
2020-03-02T09:30:01  <batey96> while waiting,i will dive around the codebases to acquaint myself
2020-03-02T09:30:23  <the-t-in-rtf> Good idea!

2020-03-02T09:31:02  <the-t-in-rtf> @kasparnet, not sure if you've coordinate with Greg, but two points about the weekly arch meeting.
2020-03-02T09:31:27  <the-t-in-rtf> 1) Are we having this week, or is it cancelled because of the face-to-face meeting many of us are attending?
2020-03-02T09:32:19  <the-t-in-rtf> 2) The US has daylight savings this weekend.  In the past we've pinned the time to European hours, but next week's seems to be based on US hours, and is an hour earlier.
2020-03-02T09:32:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, just looking at my calendar for the week and calling out any "icebergs" up ahead.

2020-03-02T09:46:21  <dmahajan980> Hi @the-t-in-rtf! I'm having my university exams these days. So I'll start working again full time by 7th March. Meanwhile, I'd been learning infusion and was working on familiarizing myself more with the Gamepad API.
2020-03-02T09:47:13  <the-t-in-rtf> @dmahajan980, sounds good.
2020-03-02T09:48:39  <dmahajan980> I had a few questions as well, but I think it'll be better if we discuss that after my exams finish (on 7th March).
2020-03-02T09:48:40  <the-t-in-rtf> If you want an example of using Infusion and the Gamepad API together, here's a project I work on in in my spare time.
2020-03-02T09:48:41  <the-t-in-rtf> https://bitbucket.org/duhrer/gamepad-to-midi/src/master/
2020-03-02T09:49:27  <the-t-in-rtf> Once you read up on Infusion, you'll see that I use its concepts of "events" and "model listeners" to track changes to the gamepad inputs.
2020-03-02T09:49:28  <dmahajan980> Amazing! I'll definitely check it out.
2020-03-02T09:49:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Not that we have to do it that way for this project, it's more an example of making both work together.
2020-03-02T09:52:16  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf it'll be really helpful in the better understanding of role of infusion here. Thanks for sharing it!
2020-03-02T09:53:47  <the-t-in-rtf> Hopefully that will give you an idea of how we use infusion to produce work that can be extended by simply adding options.
2020-03-02T09:53:58  <the-t-in-rtf> or by adding an overlay of new options and functions
2020-03-02T09:55:04  <the-t-in-rtf> you can see that a lot of the projects in that repo have a common "harness" grade that takes care of some of the basic wiring, for example.
2020-03-02T09:55:23  <the-t-in-rtf> and depending on the "instrument", they choose to do different things with the axis and button input.

2020-03-02T09:57:45  <the-t-in-rtf> The "PS4chestra" demo is the best one to try if you want a practical demo, as you can see it work onscreen without a MIDI instrument.
2020-03-02T09:58:23  <the-t-in-rtf> however, because of the MIDI support you do need to use a Chrome-derivative such as Chrome, Opera, Edge (I think)
2020-03-02T10:06:24  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf: Noted, with thanks!
2020-03-02T10:07:04  <the-t-in-rtf> You are very welcome.

2020-03-02T12:14:37  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: just seeing your message about the infusion name. Trunk would have been language used from when the code base was in an SVN repository. Also the .project file was for working with the Eclipse IDE, if I'm remembering correctly. So it isn't really something that affected the code at all.

2020-03-02T17:04:29  <Obate> Oh wow...So I guess we will be using only this IRC channel for conversations as regards the fluid project
