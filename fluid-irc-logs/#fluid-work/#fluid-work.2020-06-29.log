2020-06-29T14:45:41  <alanharnum> greatislander gtirloni: looks like https://demo.directory.platform.coop/ is down
2020-06-29T14:46:10  <gtirloni> checking
2020-06-29T14:46:38  <greatislander> alanharnum thanks for catching that
2020-06-29T14:46:55  <greatislander> I noticed there was a JSON error on the tool library but didn't think to attribute it to the demo site
2020-06-29T14:51:09  <gtirloni> it's back
2020-06-29T14:51:22  <gtirloni> it was a SELinux setting that got reset over the weekend. I've made it permanent
2020-06-29T14:51:52  <alanharnum> thanks gtirloni
2020-06-29T16:23:38  *** clown1 is now known as clown
2020-06-29T17:26:01  <gtirloni> colinclark: not sure if this will get accepted but here it is: https://github.com/testem/testem/pull/1410
2020-06-29T17:26:51  <colinclark> woah
2020-06-29T17:26:52  <colinclark> you did!
2020-06-29T17:26:54  <colinclark> did it
2020-06-29T17:27:18  <colinclark> Microsoft has some kind of an Edge launcher module
2020-06-29T17:27:27  <colinclark> I don’t know if it would help with properly locating Edge
2020-06-29T17:27:35  <colinclark> and if the new version of Edge has changed that issue
2020-06-29T17:27:52  <colinclark> https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/edge-launcher
2020-06-29T17:27:55  <colinclark> Maybe you’ve already seen it
2020-06-29T17:28:02  <colinclark> anyway, either way, nice work!
2020-06-29T17:28:03  <gtirloni> yeah, the original issue complaints that edge is a UWP app, that it can't be launched directly, etc... but I had no problem with the latest version
2020-06-29T17:28:08  <colinclark> ah good
2020-06-29T17:28:19  <colinclark> I guess the Chrome-based version might not be UWP any more?
2020-06-29T17:28:25  <gtirloni> yeah, probably that
2020-06-29T17:29:36  <gtirloni> everything works fine here but I only tested on a single machine..   Their CI is failing with some obscure error on macOS but there are no error messages. But their CI has been failing for a long time, it seems. I'll wait for a reviewer to chime in
2020-06-29T20:29:58  <gmoss> cindyli: I've pushed up the bug fix we discovered as well as some input-checking on the sort function, looking into adding a test to catch the double-load bug, now
2020-06-29T20:34:45  <cindyli> cool. thanks, gmoss
2020-06-29T22:03:55  <dogeman> the phase 1 evaluation for gsoc starts today.
