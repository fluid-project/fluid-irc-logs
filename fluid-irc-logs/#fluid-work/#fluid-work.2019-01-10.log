2019-01-10T15:15:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I wonder if you have thoughts on this https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6312?focusedCommentId=40321&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40321
2019-01-10T15:16:52  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I did have that one open ...
2019-01-10T15:17:10  <Bosmon> Wouldn't you set up a model relay between the two locations?
2019-01-10T15:17:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but we don't know what that path would be
2019-01-10T15:17:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - why not?
2019-01-10T15:18:46  <Justin_o> the builders for the schema create the model relays between the actual panels and enactors with the general model used to tie them together and the store.
2019-01-10T15:19:11  <Justin_o> The more general model converts the preference type, as found in the preference maps for example, into that general model key.
2019-01-10T15:19:33  <Justin_o> So for example the preference type may be fluid.prefs.localization and it would get converted to fluid_prefs_localization
2019-01-10T15:19:52  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, the builder would need to know about it
2019-01-10T15:20:10  <Justin_o> but that is only for the schema version, for the grade version the  mapping is setup differently, so it might actually be "locale" instead
2019-01-10T15:20:13  <Bosmon> This relay requirement would have to be encoded in the aux schema somehow, I imagine
2019-01-10T15:20:54  <Justin_o> additionally, the exact preference type used for localization could be different.. i user could setup their own preference for it and call it "my.prefs.locale" or something
2019-01-10T15:21:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so you think we should have another options somewhere in the aux scheme just for mapping the locale. or do you think we should have a more general way of specifying what the model relay will be, instead of automating it with the prefs types?
2019-01-10T15:22:10  <Justin_o> for all of the preferences
2019-01-10T15:22:27  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, this sounds like a feature one could broadly call "aliasing" - and so we should provide a general facility for the user to encode extra paths that a preference is available at
2019-01-10T15:23:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting.. so it may show up both at fluid_prefs_localization and locale for instance

2019-01-10T19:56:52  <sgithens> Bosmon: Back from our conversation about "Registering module XYZed from path /someones/node_modules", if the same infusion module is registered twice or more, which one wins again? The first one registered or the last one?
2019-01-10T20:09:47  <Bosmon> sgithens - well neither really
2019-01-10T20:09:52  <Bosmon> But the last one mostly wins : P
