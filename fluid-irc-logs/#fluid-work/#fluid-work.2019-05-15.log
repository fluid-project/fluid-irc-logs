2019-05-15T10:41:31  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru or @javjarfer[m], which of you onboarded the language settings?
2019-05-15T10:41:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I see a lot of "languages" settings that are represented as single values.
2019-05-15T10:41:43  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/fa470c92ae1079229367ed4c888916dbdbb364a7/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6648
2019-05-15T10:41:47  <stegru> me
2019-05-15T10:41:56  <the-t-in-rtf> In looking at my registry, I see that those are actually stored as reg_multi_sz
2019-05-15T10:42:03  <the-t-in-rtf> is that something that sometimes or always happens?
2019-05-15T10:42:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I noticed it looking at the machine preferred ui language
2019-05-15T10:42:46  <stegru> well, at the time we didn't have special support for REG_SZ
2019-05-15T10:43:15  <the-t-in-rtf> so it should be reg_multi_sz?
2019-05-15T10:43:17  <stegru> I don't think it matters, because both types are stored the same
2019-05-15T10:43:21  <the-t-in-rtf> well
2019-05-15T10:43:29  <the-t-in-rtf> why do we even enter it then?
2019-05-15T10:44:20  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I can leave an appropriate TODO nearby and leave it for now
2019-05-15T10:44:24  <stegru> the type? so the handler knows it's a string and stores it accordingly
2019-05-15T10:44:40  <the-t-in-rtf> but how does that work for reg_multi_sz values?
2019-05-15T10:45:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, why is it safe to indicate that the "languages" are stored as single strings in this case?
2019-05-15T10:45:44  <stegru> reg_multi_sz values are just C arrays, reg_sz are strings (which can have null characters)
2019-05-15T10:45:57  <stegru> it's probably not
2019-05-15T10:46:07  <the-t-in-rtf> So I should make the attempt to clean it up then?
2019-05-15T10:46:08  <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2019-05-15T10:46:36  <stegru> sure
2019-05-15T10:46:38  <the-t-in-rtf> All I'd do is make the field accurate and then make the transforms output a single-element array
2019-05-15T10:47:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I am happy to tidy up as long as I know they aren't mangled for a particular reason.
2019-05-15T10:47:54  <stegru> there's no good reason for it to be like that
2019-05-15T10:48:15  <stegru> apart from "if it's not broke, don't fix it" ;)
2019-05-15T10:50:51  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, I may just leave it
2019-05-15T10:51:06  <the-t-in-rtf> we also detect the language by trying to read it as a REG_SZ
2019-05-15T10:51:07  <the-t-in-rtf> it's a mess
2019-05-15T10:51:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I will leave a TODO for the future
2019-05-15T10:51:23  <the-t-in-rtf> if, for example we end up having problems when someone sets an array, then fine
2019-05-15T10:51:37  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'd assume we get the "most preferred" single value with our strategy or things just wouldn't work
2019-05-15T10:52:37  <stegru> yes, that's right

2019-05-15T11:03:07  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru (actually hitting tab instead of enter)

2019-05-15T11:03:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not as familiar with the SPI settings handler, usually I can intuit the actual format from the transforms, but not in this case
2019-05-15T11:04:14  *** jhernandez <jhernandez!~jhernande@2a02:a03f:3ec7:7b00:5861:de51:7a31:21b8> has joined #fluid-work
2019-05-15T11:04:17  <stegru> ok
2019-05-15T11:04:29  <the-t-in-rtf> so, it's an object with a path and value?
2019-05-15T11:04:33  <the-t-in-rtf> (just found the test data)
2019-05-15T11:04:45  <the-t-in-rtf> and in this case the value is true or false?
2019-05-15T11:05:24  <stegru> this is like saying: pvParam.dwFlags |= SKF_STICKYKEYSON, pvParam is a STICKYKEYS structure that gets passed to the SPI api call
2019-05-15T11:05:47  <stegru> yes, if true then set the bit, otherwise don't
2019-05-15T11:06:17  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/f0de96f0b520cd2e1782c205847e88b5d2df08ec/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L394
2019-05-15T11:08:11  <the-t-in-rtf> so, confessional time, do we ever omit the value instead of specifying it as false?
2019-05-15T11:08:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I want to know whether I can safely require the value
2019-05-15T11:08:29  <stegru> hmm
2019-05-15T11:08:31  <the-t-in-rtf> if we should be setting the value, I can add the check and fix whatever data is broken
2019-05-15T11:09:29  <stegru> so, you want to determine it's broke if it's undefined?
2019-05-15T11:10:25  <stegru> the only thing that the value comes from is the preferences
2019-05-15T11:12:18  <the-t-in-rtf> so, what would the SPI settings handler do if the value was not set?  Is it a simple falsey check?
2019-05-15T11:12:32  <stegru> yes, i presume so
2019-05-15T11:12:35  <the-t-in-rtf> just curious, I think it's still better to try and require it if we can
2019-05-15T11:13:25  <the-t-in-rtf> so, I'm afraid I've discovered another can of worms then.
2019-05-15T11:13:37  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, that setting is just the one that hadn't been sketched out
2019-05-15T11:13:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I see many others that are represented as "type": "boolean"
2019-05-15T11:13:57  <the-t-in-rtf> are those also actually using paths and values?
2019-05-15T11:14:39  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, no
2019-05-15T11:14:40  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/f0de96f0b520cd2e1782c205847e88b5d2df08ec/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L413

2019-05-15T11:15:23  <the-t-in-rtf> either the test data is wrong or the schema is
2019-05-15T11:15:29  <the-t-in-rtf> you make it sound like the schema is
2019-05-15T11:15:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I will add that pocket of madness to my test data checks.
2019-05-15T11:16:08  <the-t-in-rtf> the schemas are only really useful if valid means valid
2019-05-15T11:17:06  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, please confirm that all those settings do indeed need to have paths and values, or if the path/value stuff is only used if the path is non-standard
2019-05-15T11:17:50  <stegru> yes, the path is to a field within the structure which is passed to the API call
2019-05-15T11:18:42  <stegru> well, it's a path to a bit of a field in a structure
2019-05-15T11:19:04  <stegru> (bit as in 8th of a byte)
2019-05-15T11:19:21  <the-t-in-rtf> just to confirm, the schemas are wrong.
2019-05-15T11:19:51  <the-t-in-rtf> or can you also simply pass a boolean instead of {path: "string", value: true}?
2019-05-15T11:21:56  <stegru> I think the intention here (i'm looking at FilterKeysEnable) is the schema is related to the value
2019-05-15T11:22:19  <stegru> the value of the value field
2019-05-15T11:23:02  <the-t-in-rtf> uhhh
2019-05-15T11:23:04  <the-t-in-rtf> it can't be
2019-05-15T11:23:12  <the-t-in-rtf> the schema is related to what's stored in the prefssafe
2019-05-15T11:23:18  <the-t-in-rtf> and what's passed when setting and getting the value
2019-05-15T11:23:44  <the-t-in-rtf> so the observed data in windows-builtIn-testSpec is a prime example
2019-05-15T11:24:22  <stegru> yes, you mean this thing? http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/common/debounce/enabled
2019-05-15T11:24:23  <the-t-in-rtf> if we pass the more complex structure around when getting/setting prefs, then we either need for the schema to reflect that, or to have a documented means of going from entered values to what the settings handler needs
2019-05-15T11:24:56  <the-t-in-rtf> no, I'm talking about the one I sent earlier
2019-05-15T11:24:56  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/f0de96f0b520cd2e1782c205847e88b5d2df08ec/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L413
2019-05-15T11:25:13  <stegru> ok ok
2019-05-15T11:25:14  <the-t-in-rtf> that's a sample settings payload from the windows tests
2019-05-15T11:25:20  <the-t-in-rtf> and it's stored using the deep structure
2019-05-15T11:26:43  <stegru> hmm!
2019-05-15T11:26:45  <the-t-in-rtf> Which suggests to me that if you just passed "FilterKeysEnable": false to the settings handler, it would barf
2019-05-15T11:27:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I will leave some TODOs in the right area for now and we can discuss as we push validation further into the guts of things
2019-05-15T11:27:40  <stegru> yes, which is why there's a transform in the SR? to transform "bool" into {path:xx, value:bool}
2019-05-15T11:27:41  <the-t-in-rtf> although my inclination is to have the schema match the test data and have the TODO talk about making it easier to actually enter a value in a UI
2019-05-15T11:28:06  <stegru> yes ok
2019-05-15T11:29:38  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, thanks for your help, it's good to find and flag this stuff even if we agree to leave it be
2019-05-15T11:30:34  <the-t-in-rtf> so, my next question is, which things do I need to add the paths for for it to accurately describe what's stored in the prefs safe?
2019-05-15T11:31:04  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/fa470c92ae1079229367ed4c888916dbdbb364a7/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4961
2019-05-15T11:31:16  <the-t-in-rtf> like, are there circumstances in which path/value are/aren't used?
2019-05-15T11:31:45  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, well, the test data is making this clear as well
2019-05-15T11:32:04  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/f0de96f0b520cd2e1782c205847e88b5d2df08ec/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L730
2019-05-15T11:32:14  <the-t-in-rtf> it's the same deep structure but with a string for the value.
2019-05-15T11:39:54  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon has advocated for transform tests, which would have caught this mismatch.
2019-05-15T11:43:56  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if we'd gone from a boolean `true` for a common setting to one of the SPI settings we were discussing, it would not have been valid according to the old schema

2019-05-15T17:54:02  <sgithens> Bosmon: expanders currently must be syncronous right?
2019-05-15T18:04:22  <Bosmon> sgithens - the whole framework is synchronous
2019-05-15T18:04:51  <Bosmon> The upcoming framework will allow asynchronous actions, but only at special points in the workflow
2019-05-15T18:05:03  <Bosmon> We will still not have arbitrary asynchronous expanders, and perhaps never will

2019-05-15T19:41:07  <sgithens> Bosmon: So it can return a promise, and then that is the value that is assigned in to the model or options or whatever?
2019-05-15T19:41:56  <sgithens> Would this work?
2019-05-15T19:41:56  <sgithens> ```
2019-05-15T19:41:57  <sgithens>     model: {
2019-05-15T19:41:57  <sgithens>         messages: {},
2019-05-15T19:41:57  <sgithens>         solutions: "@expand:gpii.devpmt.loadAllSolutions({that}.options.osList, {that}.solutionsDataSource)"
2019-05-15T19:41:57  <sgithens>     },
2019-05-15T19:41:57  <sgithens> ```
2019-05-15T19:42:11  <sgithens> it seems like the dataSource is undefined at this point when I'm trying to run it
2019-05-15T19:43:20  <sgithens> oh wait
2019-05-15T19:43:23  <sgithens> it seems to be ok
2019-05-15T19:46:52  <sgithens> ok
2019-05-15T19:46:58  <sgithens> the wiring is working
2019-05-15T19:47:10  <sgithens> but
2019-05-15T19:47:27  <sgithens> the actual promise object is what is being assigned to the model value
2019-05-15T19:47:57  <sgithens> so I still need to figure out how to make the expander handle it asynchronously, rather than just use teh returned result verbatim
2019-05-15T19:50:23  <sgithens> I don't see anything in the expansion docs about having something other than just the raw return value be the value that is assigned to the option/model path

2019-05-15T20:16:26  <Bosmon> sgithens - as we just answered your question - the framework is synchronous : P
2019-05-15T20:16:34  <sgithens> oh!
2019-05-15T20:16:40  <sgithens> sorry, I misread that
2019-05-15T20:16:43  <Bosmon> There is simply no way you can have an expander which evaluates to an asynchronously available result
2019-05-15T20:17:10  <sgithens> that's what I thought.  It is something you were hacking on iwth potII though maybe?
2019-05-15T20:17:25  <Bosmon> Our standard pattern for this in the "old framework" is to use the ResourceLoader component at a higher level of containment, wait for it to do its stuff, and then have the stuff which depends on the I/O in a createOnEvent component
2019-05-15T20:17:36  <Bosmon> sgithens - it is, as I mentioned above : P
2019-05-15T20:18:10  <sgithens> upcoming == potentiaII
2019-05-15T20:18:14  <Bosmon> That one
2019-05-15T20:18:25  <Bosmon> There is only one active gigantic framework branch : P
2019-05-15T20:19:10  <sgithens> sure, but there are many upcoming versions of the framework :)
2019-05-15T20:22:43  <Bosmon> I was just going to say that I thought that it might never be possible to support async expanders - but actually in the upcoming framework branch, it would be pretty easy to support them within models
2019-05-15T20:22:54  <Bosmon> The model initialisation logic is already fully broken out into workflows
2019-05-15T20:23:01  <sgithens> excellent
