2019-08-26T14:54:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for filing https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6395 and https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6396 I'm going to look the unidirectional model relay today to see if I can get that to work. Do you have an ETA for when FLUID-6395 might be addressed? It sounds like it is a large change.
2019-08-26T14:56:17  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also I read through https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/New+New+Notes+on+the+ChangeApplier In the "Simplified and more appropriate transaction semantics" section, is there a typo for the ChangeEvent type. Specifically for endTransaction
2019-08-26T14:56:52  <Justin_o> or are they really defined by the "level" field, and if so, what is the type used for?
2019-08-26T15:03:21  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, this will be a large change and I don't expect it to land in time to help you
2019-08-26T15:03:36  *** danayo_ <danayo_!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2019-08-26T15:04:11  <Bosmon> I think if we can't get the unidirectional stuff to work I think the best approach will be to refactor your collection of cooperating components so that they just make use of a single modelComponent
2019-08-26T15:04:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, other than getting the unidirectional model relay working for the ports.. and destroying disconnected ports, do you have any other thoughts on how to minimize the number of relays?
2019-08-26T15:04:35  <Bosmon> I think I still need to get my head around the semantic a bit to understand how you have set stuff up
2019-08-26T15:04:47  <Bosmon> Since I seem to see "writes" coming in from the portBinding components and I'm not quite sure why this might be
2019-08-26T15:05:04  <Justin_o> it could be the responses
2019-08-26T15:05:22  <Bosmon> I think it should be possible to rewrite your portBinding implementation so that in practice all the operations get forwarded to a single central applier
2019-08-26T15:05:29  <Bosmon> And this will be hugely beneficial for performance anyway
2019-08-26T15:05:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: you may recall that the messaging system in chrome does not return a receipt, it's only a request. So we created a system where by the port will send a receipt of a request.
2019-08-26T15:06:20  <Bosmon> Justin_o - right - but it doesn't seem that we need to perform any update to the model based on this receipt, if it is as expected
2019-08-26T15:06:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: well there is a single applier that has ports for each connection..
2019-08-26T15:06:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, it shouldn't
2019-08-26T15:07:10  <Bosmon> Justin_o - right, but I think we should be able to do away with all the individual models attached to each of the portBinding components
2019-08-26T15:07:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean to source the model values from the parent instead
2019-08-26T15:08:13  <Justin_o> and the ports are strictly communication channels?
2019-08-26T15:08:30  <Bosmon> Justin_o - exactly
2019-08-26T15:08:31  <Justin_o> I think that makes sense.. I'll have to double check how they are used in other contexts
2019-08-26T15:08:52  <Justin_o> but that should eliminate the issu
2019-08-26T15:09:23  <Bosmon> Yes, I think faced with the possibility that we might have 1000 iframes across a browser, it is the only viable option
2019-08-26T15:09:44  <Bosmon> I mean, right now I already have 123 Chrome tabs open, just think if each of these were showing cnn.com with 44 iframes ....
2019-08-26T15:11:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you mentioned before that in future the Orator might have to issue writes back from a frame, could you say a bit more about that possibility?
2019-08-26T15:11:24  <Justin_o> yep exactly.. we'd have no chance, and in theory there may be sites that are worse than cnn.com
2019-08-26T15:12:56  <Justin_o> yes, regarding the orator. In the future it will have options for displaying the text highlight and setting the colour of that highlight. You can see from the original designs that the component itself has a settings menu https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+UI+Options+Design+Walkthrough%2C+C.1
2019-08-26T15:13:49  <Justin_o> If we follow that design, the component will need to send back its settings values so that they can be transmitted to each instance across pages
2019-08-26T15:14:43  <Bosmon> OK, I see
2019-08-26T15:14:54  <Bosmon> There will be a kind of "flyweight" settings UI embedded into the iframe?
2019-08-26T15:16:34  <Bosmon> Hi there gmoss - I will be going away for a bit so I wanted to check in how much of a mess merging in my branch had made of your work? : P

2019-08-26T15:27:56  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, well there is a UI for the Orator already embedded. It will also include settings in the future. At the moment though, this work is all on hold because of the Chrome pause bug.
2019-08-26T15:28:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh yes, I remember hearing an update about needing to make a fix to the Chrome source?

2019-08-26T15:29:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that's something I'm looking into here and there. So far I've only gotten as far as pulling down the source and creating a build of Chrome (it takes a long time). I still need to sort out how to setup the debugger for it though.
2019-08-26T15:30:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - is there a JIRA?
2019-08-26T15:30:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6320
2019-08-26T15:31:05  <Justin_o> that has links to the related GPII JIRA and the chrome bug I filed
2019-08-26T15:31:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: even if we do manage to fix this ourselves, or it gets fixed by someone else, we're probably still 2 - 3 months out on it being released to the stable channel.
2019-08-26T15:32:23  <Bosmon> Justin_o :(
2019-08-26T15:34:29  <Justin_o> I filed that bug over a year ago, I'm a bit surprised it hasn't come up more, but I guess there aren't a lot of uses of the web speech api at the moment.
2019-08-26T15:34:36  <Bosmon> Oh wow
2019-08-26T15:34:44  <Bosmon> I was puzzling over how it managed to receive a comment 3 weeks before it was filed
2019-08-26T15:34:51  <Bosmon> But I forgot to check the year field : P
2019-08-26T15:35:01  <Justin_o> haha
2019-08-26T15:35:50  <Justin_o> amazingly I retested the issue just 1 year + 1 day after having filed the original
