2020-04-02T15:03:01  <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb :)
2020-04-02T15:03:13  <Bosmon> I just had your nice note relayed to me by colinclark
2020-04-02T15:03:21  <simonjb> hey Bosmon
2020-04-02T15:03:26  <Bosmon> Thanks so much for offering to help
2020-04-02T15:03:34  <Bosmon> Happy to collaborate with you on this :)
2020-04-02T15:04:12  <simonjb> I'm really happy to help and it's really good for me personally right now to have a hard technical problem to be able to dig into :)
2020-04-02T15:04:30  <Bosmon> Cheers simonjb - hopefully not too hard, but just somewhat annoying : P
2020-04-02T15:04:41  <simonjb> I don't want to duplicate any work that you are working on
2020-04-02T15:04:54  <Bosmon> Well, my time to actually get to a machine these days is still pretty limited
2020-04-02T15:05:13  <simonjb> right now, I trying to reliably reproduce the problem
2020-04-02T15:05:13  <Bosmon> Very shortly I am going to journey up the hill again with my newly ebayed battery-powered pump in an attempt to restore water to the house : P
2020-04-02T15:05:33  <Bosmon> I am quite astonished by the capacity of delivery drivers to find this place
2020-04-02T15:05:52  <simonjb> I hope you get your water set up :)
2020-04-02T15:06:10  <Bosmon> Well, this is going to be one of those problems that is unlikely to get solved permanently
2020-04-02T15:06:34  <Bosmon> My feeling is that these kinds of journeys are going to be a regular feature of my life whenever dry weather reappears : P
2020-04-02T15:06:49  <simonjb> :)
2020-04-02T15:09:35  <simonjb> Bosmon: I will update the JIRA with any progress I make. initially, I'm working on a program that will reliably cause the crash
2020-04-02T15:10:36  <Bosmon> simonjb - that is brilliantly helpful, thanks
2020-04-02T15:11:23  <Bosmon> I think that it is pretty clear that the uncaught exception handler is inappropriate and should not terminate the process, and so there are some low-hanging fruit in just fixing that
2020-04-02T15:11:34  <Bosmon> But the more puzzling issue is why the concurrency issue happens in the first place

2020-04-02T18:21:53  <gmoss> simonjb, Bosmon: I appreciate that you're both putting time into solving this issue! :) I'm now able to confirm that the issue is happening in the production environment, so it's almost certainly the cause for the recent issues I mentioned in my email. If there's anything I can do in the bug-hunting process, please let me know.
2020-04-02T18:25:47  <simonjb> gmoss: I'm making some progress in reproducing, I have a Python program that is able to crash the server in about 5 seconds by sending batches of 500 requests from 8 processes to /css/storyTelling.css

2020-04-02T18:26:39  <gmoss> simonjb: great!
2020-04-02T18:27:22  <simonjb> gmoss: it's still early days and I'm defintiely still experimenting, but I can push what I have so you could try on your computer also
2020-04-02T18:27:55  <simonjb> gmoss: it uses Python 3. do you have Python installed?
2020-04-02T18:28:23  <gmoss> simonjb: sure! I don't on this machine, but that can be changed :)
2020-04-02T18:28:57  <simonjb> I started with Python, rather than node, because it has some nice async within a process together with easy spawning of multiple processes
2020-04-02T18:29:39  <simonjb> ok, give me a few mins to clean up and push to github
2020-04-02T18:29:40  <gmoss> simonjb: makes sense. I just checked, I was thinking of my other machine. I have 2.7 and 3.7

2020-04-02T18:45:21  <gmoss> simonjb: love the name haha. thanks I'll try it out
2020-04-02T18:45:53  <simonjb> gmoss: please let me know what you see on your computer. you're running Windows right?
2020-04-02T18:46:36  <gmoss> simonjb: yep, win 10 build 1903
2020-04-02T18:47:09  <simonjb> one thing that I'm still experimenting with is that sometimes, my load-generating program is unable to make a connection. which could be a that I'm hitting an OS limit on max number of connections
2020-04-02T18:48:14  <simonjb> but my current program is able to reliably crash the sjrk server in about 5 seconds on my computer. Windows 10 1909
2020-04-02T18:49:31  <simonjb> gmoss: the instructions in the README assume py is python 3
2020-04-02T18:50:07  <gmoss> simonjb: pip install seemed to go smoothly :)
2020-04-02T18:50:35  <simonjb> cool
2020-04-02T18:51:48  <gmoss> simonjb: I just ran it, the script spat out an exception with a very long stack trace, but the server was crashed after 8s or so
2020-04-02T18:51:55  <gmoss> so it works as intended :)
2020-04-02T18:52:16  <simonjb> yes, my program will crash when it can't connect to the server
2020-04-02T18:52:32  <gmoss> my kettle crash message came after the script stopped, oddly

2020-04-02T18:55:07  <simonjb> gmoss: yeah, that's interesting. I definitely don't have a good understanding yet of the crashing mechanism
2020-04-02T18:55:22  <gmoss> simonjb: I'll run it again, see if the results are the same

2020-04-02T18:56:52  <gmoss> simonjb: Kettle seems to continue to receive requests after the py script has halted, but Kettle is 3/3 crashes after running the script
2020-04-02T18:57:35  <gmoss> maybe it'll happen faster if we request infusion-all.js
2020-04-02T19:00:31  <simonjb> gmoss: this is really interesting. I'm now in a state where I can't load /resources.html at all in a browser
2020-04-02T19:00:51  <simonjb> I start the server, start load in the browser, and server crashes
2020-04-02T19:01:20  *** shash13 <shash13!~shashank1@45.252.77.120> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-02T19:01:47  <simonjb> the server crashes before the page is fully loaded. I haven't seen this before
2020-04-02T19:01:59  <gmoss> simonjb: curious.. I can load that page, but now the script isn't crashing Kettle as reliably
2020-04-02T19:02:07  <gmoss> simonjb: I've seen it once or twice, but not today
2020-04-02T19:02:28  <simonjb> I wonder if some OS resources are tied up
2020-04-02T19:02:36  <gmoss> seems plausible
2020-04-02T19:02:55  <gmoss> one thing that's painfully evident while debugging this issue is the sheer number of requests made on page load
2020-04-02T19:02:57  <simonjb> now it's loading
2020-04-02T19:03:07  <simonjb> interesting

2020-04-02T19:04:53  <simonjb> with unable to connect
2020-04-02T19:05:40  <simonjb> my current working theory is that I'm hitting some OS limit in max connections, but still very early in the investigation
2020-04-02T19:06:39  <simonjb> gmoss: I'll continue working on it and keep you updated
2020-04-02T19:06:45  <gmoss> simonjb: to clarify, you mean this might be why your script is crashing, correct?
2020-04-02T19:06:47  <gmoss> okay :)
2020-04-02T19:07:26  <simonjb> gmoss: yes, I think my script is hitting some OS limit and crashing -- if I reduce the number of requests and processes, it doesn't crash

2020-04-02T19:13:58  <gmoss> simonjb: that seems to hold true. I just very hackily changed line 12 to read `conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=20)`, and now both programs are chugging along happily. maybe there's a sweet spot between the OS limit and the number of concurrent requests required to trigger the Kettle crash
2020-04-02T19:14:59  <simonjb> gmoss: yeah, that's what I think also. but I'm not confident yet that I understand what is happening

2020-04-02T19:16:13  <gmoss> simonjb: at the very least, Kettle can be crashed semi-reliably :)
2020-04-02T19:16:34  <simonjb> gmoss: yes, it's a start anyway

2020-04-02T19:21:05  <gmoss> simonjb: this file sets up the Kettle server component: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/src/server/serverSetup.js
2020-04-02T19:21:05  <gmoss> and this file does the heavy lifting: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/src/server/requestHandlers.js
2020-04-02T19:22:09  <simonjb> gmoss: and specifically what code serves /css requests?

2020-04-02T19:25:04  <gmoss> simonjb: baseTheme is what will be responding to the request for `storyTelling.css`
