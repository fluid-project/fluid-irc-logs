2018-10-01T11:57:12  <jhernandez> FYI, the installer is working fine (including the reset desktop icon)
2018-10-01T11:57:33  <Bosmon> jhernandez - completely awesome!
2018-10-01T11:58:09  <jhernandez> also, I've performed some tasks and so far, it's working very good
2018-10-01T11:59:08  <jhernandez> I still need to check thee tests after the updates made yesterday
2018-10-01T11:59:12  <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks for that ^
2018-10-01T12:00:39  <jhernandez> the only "thing" is that, in the PSP, the highcontrast theme is being shown 3 times (even though the prefs set only contains the generic high contrast theme term)
2018-10-01T12:01:15  <jhernandez> and changing the application-specific values from the PSP leads to problems
2018-10-01T12:06:48  <jhernandez> other than that, no problems, no errors, no unexpected behaviors, keying-in/out with snapsets works fine, saving the prefs into the cloud is working, etc
2018-10-01T12:07:07  <jhernandez> I also reported some wording-related issues to Bern and Gregg
2018-10-01T12:21:22  <Bosmon> jhernandez - really, really good
2018-10-01T12:21:30  <Bosmon> Thanks so much for putting it all together

2018-10-01T12:36:32  <dandimitrov> jhernandez: Great! I tried creating an installer once again but strangely the installation again was problematic… Looks like it’s a problem on my side :/
2018-10-01T12:37:15  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: yeah, probably it's because you're missing the bits from https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/41/files#diff-6232a0f8fc22eca92f00dd5bc94a4f28R101

2018-10-01T13:33:11  <Bosmon> Hi dandimitrov, cindyli - so it looks like we have both come to the same conclusion about the cause of the test failure in the QSS + DR branch
2018-10-01T13:33:53  <Bosmon> My version of the fix was just slightly different to cindyli's, which I did test as working - my version is to add an extra element into the selector which selects the flowManager in the config file, so that it reads as follows: {that localConfig flowManager}
2018-10-01T13:34:31  <Bosmon> Here is my version of the config file: https://gist.github.com/amb26/a92ea051c9e02e65c638f197a67308bb
2018-10-01T13:34:54  <Bosmon> It will be interesting if cindy's fix does produce different results to mine since it would suggest some kind of error in the inheritance structure of the flowManager
2018-10-01T13:35:03  <Bosmon> But please do test both of them and see what happens
2018-10-01T13:35:09  <cindyli> Bosmon: let me try if your version would fix another failure down below - https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/44#issuecomment-425887389
2018-10-01T13:35:23  <Bosmon> With my fix I get past the {lifecycleManager} and then get a different failure in the QSS itself
2018-10-01T13:35:42  <Bosmon> The failure I get is this:
2018-10-01T13:35:44  <Bosmon> 05:06:44.473:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot read property 'common-language' of undefined

2018-10-01T13:36:47  <cindyli> a different one …
2018-10-01T13:39:26  <Bosmon> cindyli - you get a different one to this?
2018-10-01T13:40:19  <cindyli> Bosmon: i got the same one as georgitodorov reported - https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/44#issuecomment-425887389

2018-10-01T13:42:20  <cindyli> i got the same as my fix:

2018-10-01T13:42:27  <Bosmon> Doesn't make sense
2018-10-01T13:42:40  <Bosmon> If it can resolve {lifecycleManager} on startup, it should be able to resolve it at any other time
2018-10-01T13:43:28  <Bosmon> Ah I see, this is happening at destroy time
2018-10-01T13:44:43  <Bosmon> I imagine there is a race condition which means that the lifecycleManager has already been destroyed
2018-10-01T13:45:26  <cindyli> destroy time? looks to me it happens at a key out
2018-10-01T13:45:44  <Bosmon> cindyli - look at the stack in dandimitrov 's log file
2018-10-01T13:45:57  <Bosmon> They have the following listener:
2018-10-01T13:45:58  <Bosmon>         "onDestroy.beforeExit": {
2018-10-01T13:45:58  <Bosmon>             listener: "{that}.keyOut"
2018-10-01T13:45:58  <Bosmon>         }
2018-10-01T13:46:16  <Bosmon> I think they will just have to remove it
2018-10-01T13:46:31  <cindyli> ah i see
2018-10-01T13:46:38  <Bosmon> Or else schedule it on the lifecycleManager's destroy and not their own one
2018-10-01T13:46:53  <Bosmon> In practice, better for any such listener to be encoded in the core in any case
2018-10-01T13:47:21  <Bosmon> Anyway, I think this is enough info for everyone to get unstuck :)

2018-10-01T13:52:39  <cindyli> this change to that listener will fix the problem:
2018-10-01T13:52:40  <cindyli>         "{lifecycleManager}.events.onDestroy": {
2018-10-01T13:52:41  <cindyli>             listener: "{that}.keyOut",
2018-10-01T13:52:41  <cindyli>             priority: "first",
2018-10-01T13:52:41  <cindyli>             namespace: "beforeExit"
2018-10-01T13:52:41  <cindyli>         }
2018-10-01T13:53:43  <cindyli> but the magnifier doesn't seem to be stopped when the entire test run completes
2018-10-01T13:56:31  <cindyli> i think it's probably because performLogout() is async, and {lifecycleManager}.events.onDestroy won't wait for the key out to complete
2018-10-01T14:00:12  <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The "Cannot read property 'common-language' of undefined" is due to message bundles being not created
2018-10-01T14:00:45  <georgitodorov> So, I guess we should alter the `package.json` so that it performs `npm run build` as a first step in the testing process
2018-10-01T14:01:24  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, I have a question about the INI file handing if you're around.
2018-10-01T14:01:33  <the-t-in-rtf> Take this small example of a nested category:
2018-10-01T14:01:33  <stegru> yes, the-t-in-rtf ?
2018-10-01T14:01:34  <the-t-in-rtf> [speech]
2018-10-01T14:01:34  <the-t-in-rtf> 	synth = oneCore
2018-10-01T14:01:34  <the-t-in-rtf> 	[[oneCore]]
2018-10-01T14:01:34  <the-t-in-rtf> 		voice = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft
2018-10-01T14:01:48  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess you expect the setting key to be speech.oneCore.voice?
2018-10-01T14:02:03  <the-t-in-rtf> and that the INI settings handler will take care of indenting, et cetera?
2018-10-01T14:02:03  <stegru> up until now, yes
2018-10-01T14:02:10  <the-t-in-rtf> please expand on that.
2018-10-01T14:02:19  <the-t-in-rtf> do we plan to change it?
2018-10-01T14:02:39  <stegru> well, I mean it probably isn't doing as it's supposed to otherwise you wouldn't ask ;)
2018-10-01T14:02:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because NVDA has a bunch of nested settings like that and I'm working on onboarding 140+ settings.
2018-10-01T14:02:51  <the-t-in-rtf> no, I ask because I've never had to enter it before.
2018-10-01T14:03:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll put it in the way that *should* work, and then we'll talk if it doesn't... ;)
2018-10-01T14:03:08  <stegru> if it updates an existing ini file, it should respect the indentation

2018-10-01T14:03:32  <stegru> If it adds a new setting, then it wouldn't be indented
2018-10-01T14:03:39  <stegru> is the indentation important?
2018-10-01T14:03:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I meant the fact that [[oneCore]] was indented further and double enclosed
2018-10-01T14:03:58  <stegru> double enclosed, yes
2018-10-01T14:04:06  <the-t-in-rtf> but the indentation is just sugar?
2018-10-01T14:04:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we'll find out soon enough.
2018-10-01T14:04:15  <stegru> I think so
2018-10-01T14:04:30  <the-t-in-rtf> to paraphrase Sam Jackson, hold on to your vape pens.
2018-10-01T14:04:46  <stegru> although, NVDA is written in python.. so indentation may matter.. who knows
2018-10-01T14:04:55  <the-t-in-rtf> thankfully its source is open
2018-10-01T14:05:07  <the-t-in-rtf> parsing the python aside we can find out what it does precisely.
2018-10-01T14:05:38  <the-t-in-rtf> it takes so much guess work out of figuring out complex supported values.
2018-10-01T14:05:50  <the-t-in-rtf> They also have OK documentation, much better than JAWS.
2018-10-01T14:05:55  <stegru> yes
2018-10-01T14:07:54  <stegru> no, indentation does not matter - the previous ini file did not indent at all

2018-10-01T14:13:21  <the-t-in-rtf> so, if I deindent the file while NVDA is not running and then run, it indents it.
2018-10-01T14:13:26  <the-t-in-rtf> and properly.
2018-10-01T14:13:29  <the-t-in-rtf> so I think we're good.
2018-10-01T14:13:59  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it seems to care, but it also doesn't assume that the file is already indented.
2018-10-01T14:22:27  <stegru> ok great

2018-10-01T17:25:23  <jhernandez> *I guess* that we're fine merging it

2018-10-01T17:41:54  <cindyli> jhernandez: are you there?
2018-10-01T17:53:04  <cindyli> Bosmon, jhernandez, we should talk about the proper fix for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3416
2018-10-01T17:53:46  *** clown is now known as clown_mtg
2018-10-01T17:56:22  <cindyli> jhernandez: i don't get 3 controls on PSP when keying in snapset_2a. I only get 2 set of controls on PSP for high contrast: one for windows, one for UIO+
2018-10-01T17:57:40  <cindyli> the solution that Bosmon suggested I believe was also based on the assumption that there are 3 matchmaking results were returned to PSP for high contrast, one for the top level common term, the other 2 are for application specific
2018-10-01T17:57:53  <cindyli> i've double checked this is not true
2018-10-01T17:58:39  <cindyli> there are only 2 set of application specific matches were returned:
2018-10-01T17:58:40  <cindyli> 1. http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.windows.highContrast
2018-10-01T17:58:48  <cindyli> 2. http://registry.gpii.net/applications/net.gpii.uioPlus
2018-10-01T17:59:46  <cindyli> this is correct because snapset_2a only contains application level high contrast prefs
2018-10-01T18:03:16  <cindyli> however, if someone keys in with snapset_2a -> use QSS to adjust the high contrast -> save. now 3 high contrast controls will be displayed because QSS sends request on top level common term and now 1 top level plus 2 application level are in snapset_2a prefs set
2018-10-01T18:04:26  <cindyli> anyway, the original solution will need some adjustments at least. we should talk, Bosmon, jhernandez

2018-10-01T18:10:50  <cindyli> oh, aother problem that jhernandez mentioned is reproducible: when snapset_2a first keys in, the white on black high contrast applies but QSS still shows "regular contrast"
2018-10-01T18:11:34  <cindyli> all these 2 problems are cuz of the mismatch between the top level common term and application specific terms:
2018-10-01T18:11:49  <cindyli> 1. application specific terms are only application specific;
2018-10-01T18:12:14  <cindyli> 2. the top level common term implies 2 application specific
