2019-05-09T11:58:23  <Bosmon> jhernandez - why were you thinking that this one could be skipped? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/773/files
2019-05-09T11:58:35  <Bosmon> "GPII-3851: Updated highContrast solution to use our custom themes"
2019-05-09T12:00:58  <jhernandez> this was yet another "fallback" thing to "ensure" that the right high contrast theme was applied
2019-05-09T12:01:47  <jhernandez> before finding the real solution for one of the problems we had with high contrast on 1809
2019-05-09T12:02:20  <jhernandez> that is, getting the localised highcontrast theme name
2019-05-09T12:02:53  <jhernandez> when I say 1809 I mean Windows 1809 (not a JIRA or the like)
2019-05-09T12:03:00  <Bosmon> jhernandez - right
2019-05-09T12:03:56  <jhernandez> Bosmon: oh and thanks for merging https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/757, this was a non-poisoned lowest hanging fruit
2019-05-09T12:03:59  <jhernandez> :)
2019-05-09T12:04:20  <Bosmon> But this pull just looks like it normalises the names of some desktop themes.... I'm a bit puzzled though
2019-05-09T12:04:30  <Bosmon> Are we just storing "our own" themes in the same directory along with the builtin ones?
2019-05-09T12:04:36  <jhernandez> yes
2019-05-09T12:04:59  <Bosmon> So "hc1" is a builtin scheme?
2019-05-09T12:05:01  <jhernandez> but as stegru indicated, our themes are "uglier" than the ones from MS
2019-05-09T12:05:04  <jhernandez> yes

2019-05-09T12:07:57  <jhernandez> that's why in one hand, I thought it was a good idea to use our own custom themes - in the other hand, wasn't sure it was such good idea, why shipping our custom themes if they're supposed to be there?
2019-05-09T12:08:50  <jhernandez> don't have a strong opinion, so will be happy with either decision we take

2019-05-09T15:04:53  <cindyli> sure, javjarfer[m]. Bosmon, what time works for you next week?

2019-05-09T15:07:56  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli, sorry again for the delay
2019-05-09T15:08:26  <cindyli> nah, not a problem, javjarfer[m], don't apologize :)
2019-05-09T15:09:51  <javjarfer[m]> Great, thanks cindyli !
2019-05-09T15:10:26  <stegru> jhernandez, I've managed to reproduce the "nothing gets started" problem that Gregg's seeing at nova. I think it's because the service is taking too long on the shitty computers
2019-05-09T15:10:41  <Bosmon> cindyli, javjarfer[m] - later on Monday afternoon is good
2019-05-09T15:10:55  <Bosmon> Perhaps 4ish GMT?
2019-05-09T15:11:30  <stegru> I've made a slow computer, and that's what I sometimes see - I can fix it by making it restart upon failure (I think you suggested using this in the past)
2019-05-09T15:12:31  <cindyli> np. works for me, Bosmon. javjarfer[m]: ^

2019-05-09T15:34:47  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, the service times out and then nothing else happens
2019-05-09T15:35:00  <stegru> yeh
2019-05-09T15:35:59  <jhernandez> yes, I suggested restarting it - but not sure if we could add such directive to the service (if not doing in code)
2019-05-09T15:36:05  <stegru> apart from that little thing, I can't reproduce anything else - I've even made a windows domain server where I can log in with domain users and it works ok
2019-05-09T15:36:45  <stegru> well, we can - there's an option in the service property sheet and there's something that can be done in wix
2019-05-09T15:38:16  <jhernandez> re the windows domain server test - tested with the slow machine?
2019-05-09T15:38:21  <stegru> yes
2019-05-09T15:39:09  <stegru> and I've tried with 4 combinations of slow/fast + hdd/cpu
2019-05-09T15:40:43  <stegru> you can also slow down the disk in virtualbox
2019-05-09T15:41:28  <jhernandez> true
2019-05-09T15:41:43  <stegru> it would be nice to have one of their disk images, or at least a list of installed software
2019-05-09T15:41:59  <jhernandez> I already asked for an image
2019-05-09T15:42:08  <stegru> remember the script we had for the HST? that would be nice
2019-05-09T15:43:32  <jhernandez> but we would need to ask again for it if possible
2019-05-09T15:45:21  <jhernandez> yes, we can ask Gregg to tell to whoever at nova who's going to perform the tests for us to also run the HST scripts and see what's going on there
2019-05-09T15:45:32  <stegru> yes, i'm doing that now
2019-05-09T15:45:36  <jhernandez> ok, great
2019-05-09T15:45:51  <stegru> I should have asked for it months ago
2019-05-09T15:46:45  <jhernandez> for what - the image?
