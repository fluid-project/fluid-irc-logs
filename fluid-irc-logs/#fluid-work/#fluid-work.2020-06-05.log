2020-06-05T20:14:30  <sgithens> Bosmon: It's not actually possible to have a common term scoped to just a particular application in a preference set is it?
2020-06-05T20:14:43  <sgithens> if you have a common term it's just exposed as a top level preference
2020-06-05T20:15:12  <sgithens> you can't embed different values for the same common term inside 2 different applications within a prefset
