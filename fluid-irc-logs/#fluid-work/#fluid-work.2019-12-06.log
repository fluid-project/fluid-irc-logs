2019-12-06T13:13:49  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the prefs framework demo works
2019-12-06T13:13:53  <Bosmon> Are there some failing for you?

2019-12-06T13:14:15  <Bosmon> Ah, UIOptions demo fails
2019-12-06T13:14:34  <Bosmon> Although this looks like a failure in FluidViewDebugging
2019-12-06T13:14:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: all of the demos I've tried other than the prefs framework are broken for me
2019-12-06T13:15:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks like I haven't updated the includes properly
2019-12-06T13:16:04  <Bosmon> They all need FluidPromises added etc.
2019-12-06T13:16:27  <Bosmon> And looks like there is a specific failure in FluidViewDebugging which I'll tackle, that was always quite closely tied to framework internals
2019-12-06T13:16:45  <Justin_o> thanks

2019-12-06T13:59:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: :( so now I'm running into the opposite issue of what I had the other day prior to the grade name changes. That is, the context aware grade that I'm supplying also contributes the pathing for the new template to use by the prefs editor. This is being overwritten because the auxiliary schemas that are sourced all have a base grade that includes a default value for this. Additionally the demo supplied a
2019-12-06T13:59:50  <Justin_o> template path in the options at instantiation that pointed to the template used when text-to-speech is not supported. This latter case I addressed by moving the option into a new grade and setting it as the default grade in the contextAwareness. However, this seems to point out how difficult it will be to use the contextAwareness to override existing preferences.

2019-12-06T21:21:38  <sgithens> cindyli: I almost forgot to ask you, from the the meeting yesterday, you were talking about one of your branches pulling default values, and I had meant to follow up with how you are doing that. Remember I had that one function in GPII-228 that you had commented on (which actually belonged to another branch I have open for adding more default values in the solutions registry) But I had made that function to cover at
2019-12-06T21:21:38  <sgithens> least the cases we have in the solutions registry to get the default value from a schema
2019-12-06T21:28:41  <sgithens> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/824/files#diff-f18dc1e98ab05ec53c64c5a565addcd7R68
2019-12-06T21:34:02  <cindyli> sgithens: my work for pulling default values might be a bit different - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3828
2019-12-06T21:34:12  <cindyli> the pull request is https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/820
2019-12-06T21:34:59  <cindyli> the goal of it is to read default setting values from the "reset to default" file - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/defaultSettings/defaultSettings.win32.json5

2019-12-06T21:36:29  <cindyli> and output it to the pspChannel clients by overriding the schema default such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10067
2019-12-06T21:37:08  <cindyli> it's more for pspChannel APIs rather than changes to the solution registry
2019-12-06T21:43:19  <cindyli> gmoss: the model relay transformation example we talked - https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/master/src/components/metadata/js/videoMetadataPanel.js#L78-L100
2019-12-06T21:44:04  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks for sharing it! hmm, this is kind of the opposite of what I'm looking for haha. multiple input values distilled into a single output
2019-12-06T21:44:20  <sgithens> cindyli: Ah I see, so you're not trying to see what the default value would be just from looking at the json schema
2019-12-06T21:44:41  <gmoss> what I need is a single input mapped to multiple outputs. Bosmon does anything come to mind for you as a quick, easy way to achieve that with model values?
2019-12-06T21:44:43  <cindyli> gmoss: exactly. hopefully flipping "input" and "output" would work the similar in your case
2019-12-06T21:44:57  <cindyli> sgithens: yes, that's true
2019-12-06T21:45:06  <sgithens> cool, thx
2019-12-06T21:45:10  <gmoss> cindyli: fingers crossed :) and hopefully it doesn't clobber the input value
2019-12-06T21:45:10  <cindyli> np
2019-12-06T21:46:48  <cindyli> gmoss: let me know if it doesn't work
