2020-10-23T13:25:58  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, Just seeing if you're ready for the set of merges and releases for fluid-grunt-lint-all
2020-10-23T13:26:00  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/1013#pullrequestreview-503366474
2020-10-23T13:26:19  <the-t-in-rtf> There are two responses from Justin around there, which to me suggested it still needed your OK.
2020-10-23T13:27:01  <the-t-in-rtf> All I need is to confirm that you're happy for the releases to proceed on the fluiid-grunt-lint-all side, i.e. that there don't seem to be undesired effects downstream.
2020-10-23T14:07:24  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yeah, I think all good on your side
2020-10-23T14:07:41  <the-t-in-rtf> great, I'll take care of it in a few
2020-10-23T14:10:31  <the-t-in-rtf> @greatislander, I merged Justin's older pull first, there are conflicts in the package.json in your pull now.
2020-10-23T14:10:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I can fix them, or if you have a moment I assume it'll be fairly straightforward for a non-robot.
2020-10-23T14:11:08  <greatislander> the-t-in-rtf yep, I'll take a look right now :)
2020-10-23T14:11:33  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, that's helpful, I have a parent/teacher zoom call in three minutes.  back in a few.
2020-10-23T14:15:29  <greatislander> the-t-in-rtf conflict is resolved now
2020-10-23T15:09:28  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/releases/tag/v2.0.0
2020-10-23T15:09:46  <the-t-in-rtf> Both merged, released to npm, and a release on github.
2020-10-23T15:10:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I just noticed that we still need a "main" PR for fluid-grunt-lint-all, now that the two feature PRs are merged, it would be a good time for that.
2020-10-23T15:23:10  <gtirloni> congrats on the release
2020-10-23T15:29:32  <gmoss> congratulations, the-t-in-rtf and greatislander!
2020-10-23T15:29:51  <greatislander> thanks! I realize I need to add README info for the CSS/SCSS linting, the-t-in-rtf
2020-10-23T15:30:03  <greatislander> I'll hopefully tackle that today or Monday
