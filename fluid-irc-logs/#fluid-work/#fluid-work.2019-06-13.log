2019-06-13T12:19:18  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, just to confirm, when you try to submit a validated URL missing params but that includes double-slashes, you get a 404 and not a validation error?
2019-06-13T12:19:47  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. instead of /path/:param1/more/:param2 you might send /path//more/
2019-06-13T12:20:24  <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps for simplicity just try omitting one that's surrounded by slashes
2019-06-13T12:20:35  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. /path//more/param2

2019-06-13T16:03:21  <sgithens> @the-t-in-rtf @Bosmon Really sorry to have missed you this morning, I had meant to touch base yesterday saying I might be able to make it.
2019-06-13T16:04:08  <sgithens> @Bosmon Well, part of the reason is for creating debugging and development tools, it's useful to be able to report the current loglevel, or even the entire loglevel stack
2019-06-13T16:04:56  <sgithens> Also, I'd like to try and exercise part of our flexibility now by adding a number of steps to an existing promiseTransformChain
2019-06-13T16:05:28  <sgithens> I'm getting some error from the couch {harness} in my unit tests, and I can't tell which step of the chain the error is quite coming from
2019-06-13T16:06:13  <sgithens> after comparing it very closely to the tests I based it off of for boilerplate I can't see any differences.  It's running my tests, but failing on part of the harness
2019-06-13T16:11:54  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@205.211.168.104> has joined #fluid-work
2019-06-13T16:17:56  <Bosmon> sgithens - the best way to debug into this would be to hop up the stack to some level where you can see the "sequencer" machine that manages the chain
2019-06-13T16:18:00  <Bosmon> It has a structure like this: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidPromises.js#L134
2019-06-13T16:18:21  <Bosmon> In particular, in "returns" you will be able to see the returned value from each member of the chain
2019-06-13T16:18:46  <Bosmon> Of course, once we abolish invokers and events, these machines will be entirely public and just sit there on members of "gyre components" : P
2019-06-13T16:24:47  <sgithens> Bosmon: cool.  If I wanted to though, it should be possible to distribute something in between them all correct? It's a little tricky, because you'd have to know the names of all the "before:Xyzeds" and "after:Xyzeds"....   I have a sort of standard little utility that I stuff between steps in my personal code that returns the value unaltered in another promise, but only after spitting out all the diagnostics I want and
2019-06-13T16:24:47  <sgithens> allowing other hooks.
2019-06-13T16:25:11  <sgithens> similar with events and listeners to sprinkle them all over the place from lichen
2019-06-13T16:29:47  <Bosmon> sgithens - in practice you just need to know the name of one thing you want to be distributed "in between" next to
2019-06-13T16:30:02  <Bosmon> That is, it's enough to know either the name of something before it, OR the name of something after it

2019-06-13T20:12:36  <gmoss> Bosmon: sorry I was afk for a little bit there. I'm trying to set up a trio of static middleware components on my kettle server, all on the same route, expecting that each will fall back to the next when it can't satisfy a request (much as described in the Express docs https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static#multiple-roots), but it only tries the first middleware component and then 404's without trying the next
2019-06-13T20:13:33  <gmoss> have I misunderstood either the Express or Kettle functionality?
2019-06-13T20:14:20  <gmoss> TLDR: I want to serve at site root from three different folders on the host FS, but it's only looking in one of them for the requested file

2019-06-13T20:34:36  <Bosmon> gmoss - pretty interesting
2019-06-13T20:34:58  <Bosmon> I'm just looking at the docs for serve-static - there is the following option which defaults to "true" https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static#fallthrough
2019-06-13T20:35:48  <Bosmon> As far as I can understand, this default is what we want
2019-06-13T20:36:05  <gmoss> Bosmon: that's also my understanding
2019-06-13T20:37:27  <Bosmon> So, as long as the static middleware is not passing to next(err), the next middleware in the sequence should be tried as per usual
2019-06-13T20:38:01  <Bosmon> Do you want to check in your code to show how you have configured it?
2019-06-13T20:38:24  <gmoss> Bosmon: sure, I'll make a branch with my current setup

2019-06-13T20:48:27  <gmoss> this is the way I had been doing it based on alanharnum's prior work, but I'm still learning, of course ;)

2019-06-13T20:49:30  <Bosmon> For your static files, you just want one handler - and then stack all the three middleware onto it using the "requestMiddleware" option as shown in https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/Middleware.md
2019-06-13T20:49:52  <Bosmon> As in the example shown following the text "Our handler:"

2019-06-13T21:33:27  <gmoss> it says "If any of the middleware in this sequence signals an error, the entire sequence will be aborted and an error returned to the client."
2019-06-13T21:45:42  <Bosmon> gmoss - that's correct, but by the description of the "fallthrough" option for the middleware, it ought not signal an error on a missing file if it is set to true
