2020-04-22T15:30:11  <christopher> Hey stegru, on the PRs: do you have time to chat about VolumeControl.cpp?
2020-04-22T15:30:34  <stegru> yes.. i can type, but not talk
2020-04-22T15:30:38  <christopher> Okay :)
2020-04-22T15:31:06  <christopher> Do you prefer to do this here, or over in Skype/Slack?
2020-04-22T15:31:12  <christopher> I ported the code over to C#...
2020-04-22T15:31:14  <christopher> https://github.com/oregondesignservices/MorphicLiteClientWindows/blob/working/christopher/Morphic.Windows.Native/Audio/AudioEndpoint.cs
2020-04-22T15:31:21  <christopher> https://github.com/oregondesignservices/MorphicLiteClientWindows/tree/working/christopher/Morphic.Windows.Native/WindowsCoreAudio
2020-04-22T15:31:34  <christopher> And made some notes on the "setmute/getmute" and also on releasing objects in memory.
2020-04-22T15:31:42  <stegru> nice! i was going to do that
2020-04-22T15:31:44  <christopher> [for the C++ code]
2020-04-22T15:32:03  <christopher> You're the man, stegru :)
2020-04-22T15:33:40  <christopher> Do you think it's within scope to add "GetMute" and "SetMute" to the VolumeControl.cpp file, and wire those up in gpii-app?
2020-04-22T15:34:06  <stegru> no...
2020-04-22T15:34:13  <christopher> With the newer versions of Windows, we can treat those two items discretely (instead of setting volume to zero and detecting a volume level of zero...which doesn't match the "mute" icon on the app).
2020-04-22T15:34:27  <stegru> i'm going to replace the c++ implementation with your c# one
2020-04-22T15:34:30  <christopher> OH :)
2020-04-22T15:35:04  <stegru> call it via edge.js, rather than an external process
2020-04-22T15:35:14  <christopher> Cool.  Then I have no further notes :)
2020-04-22T15:35:35  <stegru> nice one
2020-04-22T15:35:35  <stegru> thanks
2020-04-22T15:35:42  <christopher> The one thing to maybe do when switching over...is to maybe also call "GetVolumeLevelScalar" in the set function, to get back a verification that the volume is set.
2020-04-22T15:35:56  <christopher> Right now we've been returning "0" as the response.
2020-04-22T15:36:06  <stegru> ok, yes makes sense
2020-04-22T15:41:43  <stegru> christopher, just mentioning it because we had this problem.. you might want to check how if works with no sound card
2020-04-22T15:41:58  <christopher> I added an exception for that.
2020-04-22T15:41:59  <stegru> "works" as in, it doesn't explode :)
2020-04-22T15:42:43  <christopher> https://github.com/oregondesignservices/MorphicLiteClientWindows/blob/working/christopher/Morphic.Windows.Native/WindowsCoreAudio/Exceptions/NoDeviceIsAvailableException.cs
2020-04-22T15:43:15  <christopher> We should test to make sure we get that exception thrown (when calling GetDefaultAudioEndpoint) in the specific scenario you were seeing.
2020-04-22T15:44:43  <christopher> That's a great issue to bring up, stegru, something to explicitly verify is being detected properly; blowing up would definitely not be muy bueno. :)
2020-04-22T15:45:22  <stegru> well, yes.. we had a deployment to a bunch of machines with no sound card :)

2020-04-22T21:14:24  <greatislander> Teddy___: what version of node are you running?
2020-04-22T21:14:27  <greatislander> `node -v` should tell you
2020-04-22T21:15:16  <Teddy___> `v12.16.1`
2020-04-22T21:23:33  <greatislander> Teddy___: did you try adding all four dependencies (`child_process`, `fs`, `net`, and `tls`) to the node config in nuxt.config.js? You should be able to remove them from package.json if you do that.
2020-04-22T21:24:13  <greatislander> Also, in your last commit I think you deleted the dependencies from `package.json` but didn't update the `package-lock.json` file.
2020-04-22T21:24:36  <Teddy___> Okay I'll try that
