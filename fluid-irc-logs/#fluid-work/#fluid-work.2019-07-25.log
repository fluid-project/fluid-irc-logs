2019-07-25T12:34:11  <jhung> Justin_o - greatislander showed this to me and I thought it may be an interesting way of generating summaries / text-reduced versions of content. Could be useful for UIO and even CISL.

2019-07-25T12:44:58  <jhung> sorry Justin_o https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser
2019-07-25T12:48:52  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. actually I looked at that before when working on content simplification. In the end we decided to write our own for UIO+. Although that was a while ago. Where is the summary generation, that could be interesting
2019-07-25T12:50:33  <Justin_o> okay, so reader is what I looked at before, and the parser is the thing that makes the summaries I guess
2019-07-25T12:50:39  <jhung> Justin_o it can generate an abstract... but not sure how that's done. I wonder if it will be good enough for a summary.
2019-07-25T12:51:41  <Justin_o> I wonder if it would work in the browser?

2019-07-25T12:56:05  <Justin_o> from this post it sounds like it should work in the browser. https://postlight.com/trackchanges/mercury-goes-open-source
2019-07-25T12:56:26  <Justin_o> that's interesting... could be useful as an option to provide a summary of the content at the top of the page or maybe in a dialog.
2019-07-25T12:56:40  <Justin_o> I wonder how well it works with dynamic content thoug
2019-07-25T13:02:23  <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2019-07-25T13:06:43  <Justin_o> jhung, greatislander: I filed a JIRA to look into it https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6386
2019-07-25T13:06:54  <Justin_o> not sure when I'll have time to get to it, but it would be good to keep track of.

2019-07-25T16:17:54  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: Hi there! Good afternoon, I wanted to ask you if you know how a request can be make programmatically to retrieve a specific user preference set from my own cluster
2019-07-25T16:18:16  <cindyli> i have a notes for it. one sec...
2019-07-25T16:18:18  <javjarfer[m]> I have been looking into the "preferencesGetHandler.js" but I think I miss the big picture
2019-07-25T16:18:34  <javjarfer[m]> thanks!!!

2019-07-25T16:22:53  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli:  oooh that would be awesome, also, is there any docs of how the query is performed against the cloud based flowmanager from client side?

2019-07-25T16:24:13  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: stepan recently fix the cloud that we can even use Fauxton, the web UI, to access CouchDB in the dev cluster. you may wanna check with him on how to do it

2019-07-25T17:48:06  <Justin_o> gmoss: I was talking to simonjb about the race condition you had with the tests. Perhaps you can look at using puppeteer ( https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer ) with headless chrome to see if you can programmatically reproduce the race condition.
2019-07-25T17:48:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: cool! I'll check it out, thanks :)
2019-07-25T17:49:17  <gmoss> just doing some last-minute review of my SJRK-237 PR, will spend a little time checking out Puppeteer after that. so many fun framework/library names out there

2019-07-25T18:02:21  <simonjb> gmoss: remote controlling a browser /should/ be closer to what you are doing manually to trigger the crash and hopefully it will be easier to reproduce than what we tried with the 'ab' load testing tool
2019-07-25T18:03:53  <gmoss> simonjb: indeed, closer at least than curl or postman. we'll see :) once i can repro it reliably i'll have more info for a jira (which i have yet to file)

2019-07-25T18:05:36  <simonjb> it's still super-interesting that we only see it so far when the browser is running on Windows
