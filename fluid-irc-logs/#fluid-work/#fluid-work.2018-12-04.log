2018-12-04T13:31:56  <stegru> hola
2018-12-04T13:32:06  <jhernandez> yesterday I tested your slowness fix but had a problem
2018-12-04T13:32:39  <stegru> oh ok
2018-12-04T13:33:01  <jhernandez> today I started over again - just in case I was doing something wrong yesterday night
2018-12-04T13:33:19  <jhernandez> but I'm still getting the same problem and can't tell what's going on
2018-12-04T13:33:22  <jhernandez> here's the problem
2018-12-04T13:33:24  <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/B2kyktje
2018-12-04T13:34:16  <jhernandez> stegru: okay, hold a sec, maybe I'm in a wrong gpii-app branch
2018-12-04T13:34:24  <stegru> ok
2018-12-04T13:37:11  <jhernandez> yes, I was in a temp branch, npm installing again from master and pointing to your branch of windows
2018-12-04T13:40:45  <jhernandez> stegru: works perfect
2018-12-04T13:40:48  <jhernandez> :)
2018-12-04T13:41:12  <stegru> ahh great, ok :)
2018-12-04T13:42:32  <jhernandez> stegru: the pull request looks good to me
2018-12-04T13:45:35  <jhernandez> however, it's weird two have two differnt getProcessPath functions
2018-12-04T13:46:17  <stegru> yes, that's right
2018-12-04T13:46:38  <stegru> i'll remove or combine
2018-12-04T13:47:15  <jhernandez> I mean, I'm fine (I think)
2018-12-04T13:48:06  <jhernandez> I was wondering whether we could just document such thing
2018-12-04T13:49:16  <jhernandez> (in case where remove or combine is not a good alternative)
2018-12-04T13:49:42  <stegru> it's ok, javjarfer[m], I'll just make the windows grade use this new one
2018-12-04T13:49:47  <stegru> jhernandez, i mean
2018-12-04T13:49:55  <stegru> get back in your cage, jj
2018-12-04T13:50:13  <javjarfer[m]> going back into the cage stegru , sunlight was hurting me

2018-12-04T13:58:10  <stegru> aye
2018-12-04T13:59:06  <jhernandez> yesterday I tested the last from the 3.0.x series and the slowness is still there

2018-12-04T14:14:56  <jhernandez> no no, the patch is fine
2018-12-04T14:15:20  <stegru> rapido
2018-12-04T14:15:51  <jhernandez> yesterday I tested the last electron 3.0.x series without your patch, and the slowness was still there

2018-12-04T15:27:59  <the-t-in-rtf> so, one of the old timers, when's the last time you tried the magnification generic preference?
2018-12-04T15:28:15  <the-t-in-rtf> It's not in the flat.json5 file, but it's in the apptology one
2018-12-04T15:28:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because I'm working on MAGic and might as well test/fix that while I'm there
2018-12-04T15:28:37  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon? ^^^^
2018-12-04T15:29:13  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/mappings/flat-apptology.json5#L5
2018-12-04T15:30:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I see test sets that reference it, I just want to know what the minimum I have to do is to make the association between the missing magnification enabled setting and launching MAGic
2018-12-04T15:31:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume it's just adding the entry to flat.json5, adding the capability to the solution, and then adding the "required" metadata to my preference set?
2018-12-04T15:39:22  <the-t-in-rtf> or does the required metadata not work either any more
2018-12-04T15:39:27  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli?

2018-12-04T15:49:58  <jhernandez> which magnification generic preference?
2018-12-04T15:50:13  <jhernandez> I see that both are in the flat.json5 file
2018-12-04T15:50:14  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L167-L180
2018-12-04T15:50:40  <the-t-in-rtf> huh, must need to pull that then
2018-12-04T15:50:56  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, that's the one, just asking if I can use it to launch MAGic by adding metadata to my prefs set
2018-12-04T15:52:16  <jhernandez> yes you can
2018-12-04T15:52:48  <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanksk
2018-12-04T15:53:57  <jhernandez> I don't see any problem with that, although, I'm not sure if both magic and the windows magnifier will be enabled

2018-12-04T15:55:18  <jhernandez> maybe cindyli and Bosmon know better what's the expected behavior since we stepped away of the canopy matchmaker, right?
2018-12-04T15:57:23  <Bosmon> Oh sorry, the CATT scrolled me to the top of my buffer
2018-12-04T15:57:31  <Bosmon> But I guess better to get an answer later rather than never : P
2018-12-04T15:58:11  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you can assume that if a preference is not in the QSS, it has not been tried for a pretty long while, unless Kavya has tested some recent onboarding
2018-12-04T15:58:22  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - required metadata does not function, right
2018-12-04T15:58:54  <Bosmon> jhernandez, stegru - MUY RAPPIDO!!
2018-12-04T15:59:09  <jhernandez> Bosmon: maybe the CATT had a good reason for doing that :P
2018-12-04T15:59:21  <the-t-in-rtf> great, I'll keep testing and let you know
2018-12-04T15:59:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm just at the point where I can try my new MAGic settings, not entirely convinced we're past my own insanity yet
2018-12-04T15:59:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll keep asking which fires and gushing pipes are normal and which are just me
2018-12-04T16:00:06  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully they'll cancel each other out

2018-12-04T16:13:19  <dandimitrov> - Can the `english` property also include the region of the language?
2018-12-04T16:13:32  <dandimitrov> - I've noticed that changing the language through the QS doesn't alter the `local` values returned for the installed languages. Shouldn't they be changed according to the new language?

2018-12-04T16:54:55  <the-t-in-rtf> it depends on the project, but in most cases there is a report stored in a "reports" subdirectory, it's generated and not checked in anywhere
2018-12-04T16:55:15  <the-t-in-rtf> there is also generally raw coverage data in "coverage" that's blown away at the start of each "npm test" run

2018-12-04T17:48:55  <jhung> Justin_o: I wonder if the plugin is all that necessary. Would it be bad if we just removed it and used the date format already in the file?
2018-12-04T17:49:10  <jhung> Otherwise we can write a helper that does the formatting for us.
2018-12-04T17:49:33  <Justin_o> jhung: i'm not exactly sure how it's formatting the dates or how we want it to show up
2018-12-04T17:49:42  <Justin_o> there may be a newer plugin, or as you say, we don't need it
2018-12-04T17:52:37  <jhung> Justin_o: If there's a newer plugin, then let's see if it does what we need. Otherwise I'll be fine with not using one.
2018-12-04T17:53:03  <Justin_o> okay, will have to do some hunting around.. don't have time at the moment, but maybe later today
2018-12-04T18:04:39  <sgithens> Bosmon Hahahahaha, it must have been a pretty long scroll

2018-12-04T19:12:10  <Justin_o> jhung: trying to take another look at the issue with docpad.. for the moment plugin, am i reading it correct that it is just trying to format the date, but that date is already in the correct format ?

2018-12-04T20:28:17  <Bosmon> sgithens - unfortunately my message timestamps don't have dates on them : P
2018-12-04T20:28:34  <sgithens> Bosmon: What IRC client do you use?
2018-12-04T20:28:43  <Bosmon> mIRC
2018-12-04T20:40:23  <jhernandez> Bosmon: mIRC?!?! is it still alive?
2018-12-04T20:41:10  <gmoss> the dream of the 90s is alive in mIRC
2018-12-04T20:43:12  <gmoss> I remember using that heavily back in my days on EFnet. IRC cloud is much nicer IMO :)
2018-12-04T20:48:17  <sgithens> gmoss: MOstly because it's always running in the background :)
2018-12-04T20:48:45  <sgithens> I do sometimes miss a more bare metal client, but their electron app is ok
2018-12-04T20:48:47  <gmoss> sgithens: indeed, being able to "listen" for mentions while not actively online is great
2018-12-04T20:50:36  <gmoss> though sometimes I miss the wild ASCII art and text colours we used to use, not sure IRC cloud supports that (nor should it be in this channel, probably)
