2019-07-26T14:37:50  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey there
2019-07-26T14:38:30  <jhernandez> have a question regarding javjarfer[m]'s https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/261
2019-07-26T14:39:19  <jhernandez> so, I see that his gpii.windows.rm is returning a promise, which won't be properly handled when passing over the lifecycleManager, right?
2019-07-26T14:40:08  <jhernandez> look the exchanges we had earlier today https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/261#pullrequestreview-267094955

2019-07-26T14:41:28  <jhernandez> so I suspect that the function should just return true or fail (in case of an error) instead of returning a promise, isn't it?
2019-07-26T14:53:00  <jhernandez> ok, I "think" we should be just fine, since all the actions end up in a promise.sequence  and the promise is already going to be either resolved or rejected - right?
2019-07-26T14:54:58  <jhernandez> but yeah, we'll wait for your advice on that before keep going

2019-07-26T15:41:51  <alanharnum> jhung: if you haven't done so, you may want to check out the Windows Subsystem for Linux under Windows 10 - that's how I currently do all of my bash-type CLI work. At this point in time they've done a lot to make things well-bridged - you can run things from WSL (web apps, etc) and connect to their ports from Windows in the browser. Also a very nice bridge in the Code editor for working on code in WSL.
2019-07-26T15:46:13  <jhung> Yeah Linux subsystem makes everything so much better alanharnum. The spot where I got hung up is getting wp-cli installed on Windows. The online documentation wasn't complete and there was some nuance with setting up Windows 10 environment variables and batch files.
2019-07-26T15:48:20  <alanharnum> jhung: Yeah - WSL is basically a means of avoiding having to set it up on Windows 10 altogether by running it in WSL. I've done that with some things (like Ansible) that are painful to run in Powershell or cmd.
2019-07-26T15:48:51  <alanharnum> it does require additional setup investment and with something like wp-cli you have to run Wordpress, etc from WSL as well.

2019-07-26T16:41:40  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there!
2019-07-26T16:41:56  <cindyli> hi
2019-07-26T16:42:13  <javjarfer[m]> sorry, I had a fail in CI regarding this pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/754
2019-07-26T16:43:14  <javjarfer[m]> and I think it's related to some transformation, but not just some, it could be related to the transformations that were fixed a couple months ago by your pull https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3784
2019-07-26T16:44:10  <javjarfer[m]> Even if the transformation for the setting ImageConfig, is really simple, as you can see here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/754/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R5047
2019-07-26T16:44:35  <javjarfer[m]> I get an undefined when the following payload is supplied to the solution
2019-07-26T16:45:33  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/754/files#diff-3dc8b45a7cc34ea47a9d8f7a9c753c1fR7
2019-07-26T16:47:02  <cindyli> ok. would it be related to the change to the transformation block for "ImageConfig", the line you showed me?
2019-07-26T16:47:38  <cindyli> did you try running the test with the transformation before the change - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/754/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2L5049-L5050?

2019-07-26T16:51:54  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: yes, I tried locally resulting in the same fail as in the previous build of the CI, with the transformation being this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/754/commits/4888c7b463ab816a67cf284238339972ad44f220#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R5034, and with the new one, the simplified, both of them failed
2019-07-26T16:52:22  <javjarfer[m]> thing is that this pull passed CI with that transformation back in the day, so I was just wondering if was some kind of regression

In your test case why do you expect "ImageConfig" to be configed?

2019-07-26T17:38:02  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: because the other blocks is supposed to be executed always, I need that in order to the second block to work
2019-07-26T17:39:02  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: what other blocks? "configureSolidColor" block?
2019-07-26T17:40:42  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli:  yes, for that block being able to work, I first need to set the system image to "" which is done by the previous configure block
2019-07-26T17:41:11  <javjarfer[m]> this was suggested to be done that way, since there is no other way to invoque another setting we support from the solution registry
2019-07-26T17:41:41  <javjarfer[m]> this was previously working, is the behavior now different?
2019-07-26T17:41:59  <cindyli> i don't know. this is the first time i heard about this behavior
2019-07-26T17:42:29  <cindyli> do you know another win32 definition that works like this?
2019-07-26T17:43:00  <cindyli> searching win32.json5 …
2019-07-26T17:45:09  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: no, I think that's the unique example in the file
2019-07-26T17:45:16  <cindyli> ok
2019-07-26T17:47:22  <javjarfer[m]> So, if the setting is not invoked in the preference set, the 'configure block' isn't supposed to work even if it inputs doesn't depend on any paths, and it's explicitly set in the 'configure', 'restore' blocks?
2019-07-26T17:48:14  <javjarfer[m]> if so, the unique solution for this problem, will be to make a native call in the implementation replacing the call to the "spiSettingsHandler"
2019-07-26T17:48:55  <javjarfer[m]> thing I can totally do, but since I was suggested to express this dependency this way, I wanted just to confirm before hiding the implementation the other way

2019-07-26T17:52:21  <cindyli> i think the transformer function is ok. it's just the transformation you defined at line 5049-5050 is not yet good enough. there's no way this transformation can set the empty string to the path "value"

2019-07-26T18:26:49  <cindyli> keep in mind that, if you wanna define a transformation to handle a preference that doesn't have setting name matched between the preferences and solution registry, define a "capabilities" block in win32.json5 for it - https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/pull/1/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R5046

2019-07-26T18:27:08  <cindyli> and set the "outputPath"
2019-07-26T18:27:23  <cindyli> the latter is more obvious than the former
