2019-01-08T15:07:45  <simonjb> hi Justin_o, thanks very much for the note on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/CITY-42 Would you have some time to chat with me about it and maybe walk me through the update?
2019-01-08T15:09:03  <Justin_o> simonjb: sure, i should be able to do that today. I'm basically just busy during the planning meeting and from about 1 - 2pm today.
2019-01-08T15:10:26  <simonjb> Justin_o: do you maybe want to start chatting about it now?
2019-01-08T15:10:35  <simonjb> (I'm at home)
2019-01-08T15:10:44  <Justin_o> simonjb: sure

2019-01-08T15:40:48  <stegru> Bosmon the-t-in-rtf, the word on the street is that the data blocks thing is now solved - but I'm guessing it's currently vapourware?
2019-01-08T15:41:03  <Bosmon> stegru - got it in one
2019-01-08T15:41:09  <stegru> according to my planning, in a few weeks I'm due to apply it to the office simplification
2019-01-08T15:41:49  <stegru> the solution is the external url, you written in some PR comment?
2019-01-08T15:42:07  <Bosmon> I guess the two key missing moving parts are i) a simple "URL suffix settings handler" that grabs things from a URL based on a variable suffix, ii) somewhere to put these things - where ii) could easily just be GitHub Pages or something similar
2019-01-08T15:42:41  <stegru> ahh yes, github. great

2019-01-08T15:51:21  <Justin_o> simonjb: chartAuthoring ( https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring ) pulls in Infusion through NPM. https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L37-L41
2019-01-08T15:52:19  <Justin_o> However it doesn't seem like UIO is being used. It would require that the generated CSS be pulled from the dist/assets directory.
2019-01-08T15:53:13  <simonjb> thanks Justin_o

2019-01-08T15:56:31  <jhernandez> stegru: hey, I'm testing https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/724 and I'm not sure it fixes the issue - maybe I have a buggy windows update?
2019-01-08T15:56:56  <Justin_o> however, it references Infusion 2.0. https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L29-L89 Back then we didn't have all the current distributions included in the npm package
2019-01-08T15:57:05  <stegru> ok jhernandez - you mean it still doesn't work after the fix?
2019-01-08T15:57:13  <simonjb> Justin_o: I've added a comment to the JIRA issue: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/CITY-42?focusedCommentId=40332&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40332

2019-01-08T15:57:18  <jhernandez> at least for me
2019-01-08T15:57:51  <stegru> could you pastebin the environment block?

2019-01-08T16:18:33  <jhernandez> stegru: what "fine" means to you? that it isn't really fixed yet?
2019-01-08T16:18:35  <stegru> jhernandez, ok - I was testing it with "reset to standard", rather than putting it back to "regular contrast"
2019-01-08T16:18:42  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-01-08T16:18:44  <jhernandez> interesting
2019-01-08T16:18:47  <stegru> i meant, what you pasted was fine - nothing wrong
2019-01-08T16:18:55  <jhernandez> oh, okay
2019-01-08T16:19:29  <stegru> right, my computer doesn't have some environment variables set - not sure why.. but that's what my pr fixed :)
2019-01-08T16:19:58  <jhernandez> I assume that we might get different behaviors when disabling highContrast in different ways
2019-01-08T16:20:05  <stegru> yes
2019-01-08T16:20:38  <stegru> when changing via "regular contrast", it doesn't actually restore

2019-01-08T16:24:53  <jhernandez> I assume that's because we don't perform a get/set flow but just a set action when setting the highContrast theme via the QS and that we don't keep the original theme from an initial get action, right?
2019-01-08T16:24:56  <Justin_o> avtar: out of curiosity how do you pull in Infusion for the websites you've been working on recently?
2019-01-08T16:25:59  <avtar> Justin_o: using npm

2019-01-08T16:26:16  <stegru> that's right, jhernandez
2019-01-08T16:26:55  <avtar> i take a look at all the different versions and pick the latest one, grunt song and dance, and then place the resulting build in a site's directory
2019-01-08T16:27:39  <Justin_o> avtar: cool, I was just talking with simonjb about doing that for the cities site. I wonder if you could share a link to an example of the work you have. The examples I've found from our other work doing that were a bit older.
2019-01-08T16:29:45  <avtar> Justin_o: by "link to an example" do you mean a site that's using a newer version of uio and infusion?
2019-01-08T16:30:04  <Justin_o> avtar: yes, well actually the code/configuration for setting that up
2019-01-08T16:32:13  <jhernandez> stegru: okay, issuing the reset action via the "Reset to Standard" QS button also ends up with the wrong wallpaper
2019-01-08T16:35:55  <avtar> Justin_o: the sjrk site comes to mind

2019-01-08T16:36:45  <stegru> jhernandez: yes, me too - but it works if you change the high-contrast only once

2019-01-08T16:37:20  <jhernandez> :/
2019-01-08T16:37:49  <stegru> I have a feeling I might need to make a high-contrast settings handler
2019-01-08T16:38:34  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: hey, regarding your question about reset to STD, I can confirm that the functionality is working for me with the last installer and after putting the defaultPrefSet in the right place, so I wouldn't worry about it
2019-01-08T16:38:36  <avtar> Justin_o: https://github.com/simonbates/website-cities/blob/CITY-46/layouts/partials/uio.html

2019-01-08T16:39:30  <dandimitrov> jhernandez, great to hear that : )
2019-01-08T16:39:33  <jhernandez> and release 1.0.1 with that highContrast bug?
2019-01-08T16:39:43  <stegru> yes
2019-01-08T16:39:46  <jhernandez> stegru: not saying that the PR is crap
2019-01-08T16:39:49  <avtar> i used simonjb's hugo examples in my sjrk branch
2019-01-08T16:39:51  <jhernandez> :*
2019-01-08T16:40:47  <avtar> except like so https://github.com/avtar/sojustrepairit.org/blob/SJRK-166/layouts/_default/baseof.html
2019-01-08T16:41:23  <dandimitrov> jhernandez, where should we have the defaultPrefSet :?
2019-01-08T16:41:26  <jhernandez> okay, now I'm switching over to test the fixes on the "language persists in some places" thing
2019-01-08T16:41:29  <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2019-01-08T16:41:43  <stegru> ok, good luck with that one!
2019-01-08T16:42:19  <jhernandez> yeah, testing this is a nightmare :/
2019-01-08T16:42:58  <stegru> my opinion on this fix, jhernandez, is that it might not fix everything, but it will fix most things
2019-01-08T16:43:08  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: the prefSet needs to go into the node_modules/gpii-universal/testData/defaultSettings/ folder
2019-01-08T16:43:57  <dandimitrov> hmm, isn’t it there already? - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/defaultSettings/defaultSettings.win32.json5
2019-01-08T16:43:58  <jhernandez> stegru: okay, I'll spend some time playing around with it and see if I happen to end up with mixed languages
2019-01-08T16:46:06  <jhernandez> dandimitrov: that's a pre-created file and it needs to be renamed, take a look at this https://github.com/GPII/universal/blame/master/documentation/ResetComputer.md#L29-L35

2019-01-08T17:14:28  <simonjb> Justin_o, avtar: I don't think any of those are actually using NPM, though right? NPM/Grunt might have been used in making the UIO build, but that wasn't documented or automated -- the SJRK site just contains the UIO build: https://github.com/avtar/sojustrepairit.org/tree/SJRK-166/static/js/lib/infusion
2019-01-08T17:15:12  <simonjb> there's no package.json or Gruntfile.js: https://github.com/avtar/sojustrepairit.org/tree/SJRK-166
2019-01-08T17:16:07  <Justin_o> gmoss: Would you be able to review the localizations in this PR. I can't quite remember.. maybe you set them up originally. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/949/files#diff-8c489801d86d7e1d3630448619b39f34
2019-01-08T17:17:16  <gmoss> Justin_o: yep that was my handiwork, I'll take a look at it later today :)
2019-01-08T17:17:57  <avtar> simonjb: that's correct
2019-01-08T17:17:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks.. i don't think i changed any of the language.. I think i just moved things around a bit so that the language name always appears in its own language.
2019-01-08T17:18:22  <avtar> npm usage is covered here https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html#full-infusion-library-via-npm

2019-01-08T17:23:07  <Justin_o> avtar: thanks, actually simonjb and I were talking about something a bit different. We are talking about using NPM right from the repo, along with Grunt, to pull in Infusion and copy over any needed files in place. This would automate the process for future updates.

2019-01-08T18:35:56  <sgithens> stegru, No, but I'm about to implement an option in the capture tool to only capture solutions from "Running applications only".  I haven't looking at any of the isRunning stuff lately. Which component would i use to return like a list of ID's for the currently running solutions?

2019-01-08T20:02:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: i hadn't thought about localizing the html templates.. also reminds me that we need to fix the reset button to be localized with the rest of the prefs framework.
2019-01-08T20:03:09  <gmoss> Justin_o: indeed!
2019-01-08T20:03:17  <gmoss> easier said than done haha
2019-01-08T20:04:19  <Justin_o> I have the ToC header localizing now, but still need to go through and make sure all the tests work and that all the various versions of the prefs framework support it..  If I can get through that in time, I'll try to cycle back to look at the reset button too
2019-01-08T20:06:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: oh cool!
2019-01-08T20:06:39  <gmoss> fingers crossed :) good luck
2019-01-08T20:07:15  <Justin_o> thanks.. if it all works out it will still just be a stop gap, we really do need to do some larger scale refactoring/rewriting of the prefs framework.
