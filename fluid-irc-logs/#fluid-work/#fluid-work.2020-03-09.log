2020-03-09T11:06:44  <dmahajan980> Hi @the-t-in-rtf! So I was looking out for ways by which we can make the controller work on all the browsers and not just chrome/chromium. I recalled that it was mentioned somewhere on the ideas page that we might use an electron app as well. So I have started to go through various electron tutorials. Still, I am not sure whether the electron framework offers the flexibility to manipulate other browser windows
2020-03-09T11:06:44  <dmahajan980> or inject our custom scripts to it. What would you suggest?

2020-03-09T12:04:36  <Justin_o> mohitgouti: I'd suggest that you work through the "How to get started" steps for the project as indicated from https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project#GoogleSummerofCode2020withtheFluidProject-RefactorandAutomateInfusionDocumentation

2020-03-09T12:10:04  <Justin_o> mohitgouti: not 100% sure what you mean, so please feel free to elaborate or correct. However, at least for now, you can just imagine that the outputted site will look and behave the same or similar.

2020-03-09T13:04:19  <dmahajan980> So I was looking out for ways by which we can make the controller work on all the available browsers by using something other than a Chrome extension as it will restrict the functionality to Chrome/Chromium. I recalled that it was mentioned somewhere on the ideas page that we might use ElectronJs for this purpose as well. So I have started to go through various ElectronJs tutorials. Still, I am not sure whether
2020-03-09T13:04:19  <dmahajan980> ElectronJs is capable of manipulating other browser windows or injecting custom scripts to the webpages/browsers. I would appreciate it if you have any advice regarding the same.

2020-03-09T14:03:27  <sachin10101998> hello jhung. I had a few queries about the migration to static site. I posted them on mailing list. Could you please check it once and answer them. It would be really helpful in drafting my proposal.

2020-03-09T14:05:27  <jhung> hi sachin10101998 I have a few tasks that are occupying my time right now, but I will try to get to it. Thanks for letting me know.
2020-03-09T14:06:02  <sachin10101998> Sure. Thanks jhung
2020-03-09T14:06:55  <obate> @jhung @Justin_o Quick question:  I have a few ideas on how we can make the Infusion Documentation page more UI friendly and easily accessible. Is it advisable for me to revamp the existing the UI by adding new features to the page?
2020-03-09T14:09:38  <jhung> hi obate. The focus is on the backend and making sure the technology supports the needs of the project. However, if you think you have ideas for the front end that will make it better, feel free to include it in your proposal and make sure to explain the reasons.

2020-03-09T15:35:53  <Arthur_Ox> @the-t-in-rtf Hi! A question regarding the game controller project - you mentioned both Electron and Chrome extension. Do I understand correctly that I would have to create either a desktop app with Electron or an extension? Is there a preference to one of those? Or do you expect a Chrome extension that would be later "ported" to desktop? Thanks!

2020-03-09T15:54:34  <Justin_o> danielcho: I didn't quite catch the solution you were describing, something about aria-live and a div. Could you say more about that, and what it was needed for
2020-03-09T15:55:14  <jhung> danielcho I'm interested in hearing more as well. If I understood, you were using an aria-live div and showing / hiding something in that container to trigger a response from a screen reader?
2020-03-09T15:56:50  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~yanachkov@185.97.75.80> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2020-03-09T15:57:28  <danielcho> Justin_o: oh, sure — there's a button that locks focus to components in other container when pressed, and we want to announce that tab order has changed to user. A solution I was thinking is to have a div with messages at the bottom or the application, initially hidden, and when the tab order changes, set aria-live='assertive' to the div, so screen readers can detect that and announce messages in the div
2020-03-09T15:57:38  <danielcho> jhung: ^

2020-03-09T16:00:04  <Justin_o> danielcho: it sounds like a modal dialog, maybe you should just be treating it like that. But I'm not sure exactly what the case is
2020-03-09T16:04:04  <danielcho> Justin_o: right, it's hard to understand without looking at it — it's an option button to change a step in a program with another command, and when the option button is pressed, we want to lock the focus to the first item in the command container.

2020-03-09T16:04:54  <danielcho> I meant to say lock the focus to items in the command container*
2020-03-09T16:05:07  <Justin_o> danielcho: how would they leave that container
2020-03-09T16:06:06  <danielcho> it will be locking focus to the items in tthe command container and the option button, and there's 2 ways to leave: 1. press esc, 2. press the option button again
2020-03-09T16:09:28  <Justin_o> danielcho: still sounds like a modal dialog ;) but I'm guessing it doesn't look like one. do you have a screenshot or example we can try
2020-03-09T16:11:14  <danielcho> Justin_o: I can show it to you on a screen share if you like to :)
2020-03-09T16:11:36  <Justin_o> danielcho: sure, jhung are you interested to join too

2020-03-09T20:23:00  <gmoss> welcome, jaytailortailor! The Wiki page for our GSoC projects has a number of "How to get started" steps listed for each project, in addition to some broader advice about our organization. I would recommend reading through the wiki page and following those steps, if you haven't done so already :) https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project

2020-03-09T21:03:10  <colinclark> aashimgarg[m]: Not a mistake, no. But based on our interactions so far, it seems to me that you might need more support than we can offer for this particular project in terms of how to collaborate productively within open source. So for example, asking specific, focused questions about the particular project, respecting other contributors’ time and resources, and using technologies like Github for open collaboration are all key points of emphas
