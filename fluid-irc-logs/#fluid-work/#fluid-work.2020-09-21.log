2020-09-21T12:23:31  <Justin_o> the extension is up.. however, could you please add a Privacy Policy to the repository and I'll link to it from our wiki page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Privacy+Policy
2020-09-21T12:23:42  <Justin_o> You can see an example from UIO+ https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md
2020-09-21T12:26:43  <dmahajan980> Justin_o: Thanks for sharing. Though we got to know about the release on the last Saturday itself. There were a few minor things I wanted to change in the web store listing.
2020-09-21T12:27:16  <dmahajan980> I'll work on adding the Privacy Policy as well.
2020-09-21T12:31:24  <dmahajan980> Please let me know when you have time so that we can work accordingly.
2020-09-21T12:31:55  <dmahajan980> (for the changes)
2020-09-21T12:42:48  <Justin_o> dmahajan980: let me know when you have updates and I can submit then
2020-09-21T13:35:37  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I merged https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/95 and closed the related Issue. However, the sites won't be updated until the next release.
2020-09-21T13:37:16  <gtirloni> Justin_o: it's fine. the staging will be updated now and we can update the others later... in this case, the vulnerabilities aren't super critical. but in the future we may need a plan to deploy faster than waiting for the next release
2020-09-21T13:38:19  <Justin_o> gtirloni: sure, that makes sense.. we should discuss that when gmoss is back.
2020-09-21T13:47:06  <gtirloni> thanks for merging!
2020-09-21T13:50:17  <Justin_o> gtirloni: no problem thanks for keeping up on these things and providing the fix
2020-09-21T14:32:20  <Justin_o> cherylhjli: are we meeting in the general room?

2020-09-21T15:05:34  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2020-09-21T15:05:39  <Bosmon> INSTANTLY
2020-09-21T15:06:31  <cindyli> thanks
2020-09-21T15:07:02  <Uttara> philip: will you be able to join the tech check-in?
2020-09-21T15:43:14  <Justin_o> danielcho: sorry, I didn't quite catch what the issue you are having with the table headers is.
2020-09-21T15:45:06  <danielcho> Justin_o: Aria grid markup requires headers to be wrapped in a row tag, so that introduces an extra row and an extra item within rows
2020-09-21T15:48:56  <danielcho> calendar example in this link has a fix to the issue of row items got shifted by one, because of the extra row item, which is to include a blank element at the beginning of the rowheaders https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Grid_Role

2020-09-21T15:52:11  <Justin_o> danielcho: what is your use case for this, is it also a calendar or some other interactive widget?
2020-09-21T15:52:44  <danielcho> it's to describe grid cells on the Scene component in the coding environment
2020-09-21T15:53:26  <danielcho> which is somewhat interesting use case of the aria grid markup, as I am trying to use grid roles to svg elements

2020-09-21T15:54:03  <Justin_o> danielcho: partly I'm wondering why the use of a table isn't sufficient. What the grid semantics might be needed for
2020-09-21T15:54:14  <Justin_o> that aren't already included in the table
2020-09-21T15:55:42  <Justin_o> danielcho: are you able to share an example with me, I might be able to understand better if I see it.
2020-09-21T15:55:50  <clown> Justin_o:  the main difference between a grid and a table is a grid is interactive.  In particular, the cells allow editing, and can contain actions.
2020-09-21T15:56:04  <danielcho> sure, I can share the preview site, one moment please :)
2020-09-21T15:56:55  <clown> that said, I don't know if danielcho needs a grid or a table in his case; I've not looked at it.
2020-09-21T15:57:14  <clown> on the surface, it sounds like he is dealing with a grid.
2020-09-21T15:58:44  <Justin_o> clown, danielcho: if it is in fact a grid that's needed, maybe removing the table markup and just using CSS flex box or CSS grid instead with the appropriate aria semantics would be easier.
2020-09-21T15:59:07  <danielcho> Justin_o: maybe it's easier if I walk through with screen share
2020-09-21T15:59:21  <danielcho> could we meet on a zoom room?
2020-09-21T15:59:44  <Justin_o> danielcho: sure, standup room?
2020-09-21T15:59:52  <Justin_o> clown: did you want to join too?
2020-09-21T15:59:55  <danielcho> sure :)
2020-09-21T15:59:56  <clown> Maybe, Justin_o.  There is nothing that requires a grid to be displayed as a table (yes, hard to think about).  But the col/row aspect is essential, as well as interactivity
2020-09-21T16:00:07  <clown> sure
2020-09-21T16:00:21  <clown> until/unless kasper calls.
