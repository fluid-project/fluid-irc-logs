2019-05-30T18:02:18  <stegru> yes, sgithens - sort of
2019-05-30T18:04:40  <sgithens> Where you just gonna use a shell utility or something to dump the registry and everything?
2019-05-30T18:04:44  <sgithens> Where
2019-05-30T18:04:46  <sgithens> Were
2019-05-30T18:05:18  <sgithens> I don't even know where SPI setting manifest themselves in the system.  Are they in a binary file somewhere?
2019-05-30T18:06:21  <stegru> well, I haven't thought that much into it yet - but the SPI setings are scattered across the registry
2019-05-30T18:10:10  <stegru> just having a dump of the registry is a bit like having a zip file of /etc, and unpacking it on another computer

2019-05-30T19:12:48  <sgithens> stegru: ok, so if you had their registry backup, and their local settings directory backup, that would actually make it possible to reconstruct most of it

2019-05-30T19:19:22  <sgithens> I had mentioned to Gregg, that it seems there must be a popular well-known utility that already does these two things. And that the best thing to do would be to create a one page flyer with a link to download it, and the few quick steps to run it to copy to a USB drive.  I haven't used Windows for a while, but it seems like copying your registry and profile directory would have a pretty standard ecosystem of 3rd party apps
2019-05-30T19:19:22  <sgithens> already
2019-05-30T19:20:19  <stegru> yes, you'd expect so. I'm sure many people have had this problem before
