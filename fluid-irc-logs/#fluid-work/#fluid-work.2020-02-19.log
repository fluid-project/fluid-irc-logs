2020-02-19T11:01:03  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there, good morning, the-t-in-rtf  do you know if we have an issue number for validations failures like this one? https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/2101/consoleText
2020-02-19T11:09:34  <the-t-in-rtf> uhh
2020-02-19T11:09:46  <the-t-in-rtf> there are new tests, and those passed before my work was merge
2020-02-19T11:10:02  <the-t-in-rtf> so anything there should only be an issue with new data that's being added
2020-02-19T11:12:43  <the-t-in-rtf> So, for example:
2020-02-19T11:12:44  <the-t-in-rtf> 10:18:56.944:  Validation error in file '/home/vagrant/sync/universal/testData/preferences/amanda.json5':
2020-02-19T11:12:44  <the-t-in-rtf> 10:18:56.944:    - http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.windows.animations.AnimationsEnabledConfig: The supplied value is not one
2020-02-19T11:12:44  <the-t-in-rtf> of the allowed values (0,1).
2020-02-19T11:13:10  <the-t-in-rtf> that solution isn't in master, so I assume that you've merged with upstream master and are now being informed about errors in the file and/or your transforms.
2020-02-19T11:13:40  <the-t-in-rtf> the new tests are helping you avoid a couple of errors we've commonly made in the past
2020-02-19T11:14:18  <the-t-in-rtf> namely, intra-application transforms that result in invalid values
2020-02-19T11:14:41  <the-t-in-rtf> so when AnimationsEnabled is transformed to AnimationsEnabledConfig, the results don't match the schema
2020-02-19T11:14:50  <the-t-in-rtf> that's what the test failure is telling you
2020-02-19T11:14:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Make sense, @javjarfer[m]?
2020-02-19T11:18:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I also check to ensure the defaults are valid, but I think those checks have been there for a while.
2020-02-19T11:18:05  <the-t-in-rtf> 10:18:59.910:  Validation error in Default value for win32.json5 -> com.microsoft.windows.cursors -> CaretWidth:
2020-02-19T11:18:05  <the-t-in-rtf> 10:18:59.911:    - : The value supplied should be a(n) integer.
2020-02-19T11:18:22  <the-t-in-rtf> That's telling you that your default isn't valid according to the schema
2020-02-19T11:18:34  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, it's true, makes sense, but it's still a validation error, this payload is well formed because the transforms deliver the correct value to the setting
2020-02-19T11:18:51  <the-t-in-rtf> uhh
2020-02-19T11:19:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not sure what you mean about a validation error
2020-02-19T11:19:28  <the-t-in-rtf> if you mean it's reporting an error in the schema definition or the transforms or the test data, then yes
2020-02-19T11:20:15  <the-t-in-rtf> if you shoot me a link to your branch I can investigate further
2020-02-19T11:21:24  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: it's the classic renaming of setting through a transform
2020-02-19T11:22:06  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/762/files
2020-02-19T11:22:47  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/762/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R9902
2020-02-19T11:25:55  <the-t-in-rtf> Friend.
2020-02-19T11:26:02  <the-t-in-rtf> That value cannot match the schema.
2020-02-19T11:26:11  <the-t-in-rtf> you haven't defined the schema in terms of the deeper structure
2020-02-19T11:26:23  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you are checking the whole object as though it only contained the value
2020-02-19T11:26:47  <the-t-in-rtf> so the transform is producing an object and the schema is checking for an enum value
2020-02-19T11:26:51  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: that's also done for nativeSettingHandler, spiSettingsHandler and systemSettingsHandler
2020-02-19T11:27:08  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, and I had to fix every single example that was broken in that way
2020-02-19T11:27:12  <javjarfer[m]> all of them has those nested settings, but none of the settings are defined in nested structures
2020-02-19T11:27:39  <the-t-in-rtf> then something happened in the merge from upstream
2020-02-19T11:27:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to move a bunch of settings into deeper structures
2020-02-19T11:28:17  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: there is a pull request or issue number for that work?
2020-02-19T11:28:18  <the-t-in-rtf> for example
2020-02-19T11:28:18  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4987
2020-02-19T11:28:25  <the-t-in-rtf> it's merged!
2020-02-19T11:28:45  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, that was the intra-application stuff needed to fix validation of any of those settings
2020-02-19T11:28:47  <the-t-in-rtf> just a minute
2020-02-19T11:29:28  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/848
2020-02-19T11:29:53  <the-t-in-rtf> There was another pull to make it possible to validate intra-application settings at all, and that one to fix all the problems we discovered
2020-02-19T11:31:04  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. there were a lot of transforms and schemas that didn't match before that pull
2020-02-19T11:32:21  <the-t-in-rtf> and you're right that before that pull, we used the pattern a lot, i.e. transforming to an object but writing a schema for just the value.

2020-02-19T11:36:31  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: okay, so as I understand I now need to modify the settings in my pulls to match this new description system true?
2020-02-19T11:45:33  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~yanachkov@185.97.75.80> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-19T11:45:47  <the-t-in-rtf> well
2020-02-19T11:46:01  <the-t-in-rtf> you need for the output of the transform to match the schema for the setting
2020-02-19T11:46:10  <the-t-in-rtf> the rules of schemas and transforms haven't changed
2020-02-19T11:46:19  <the-t-in-rtf> we just never confirmed that we were producing valid output
2020-02-19T11:49:49  <the-t-in-rtf> so the new system is to check our work better
2020-02-19T11:50:33  <the-t-in-rtf> there is another coming in to fix broken transforms to/from common terms
2020-02-19T11:50:38  <the-t-in-rtf> we had no checks there either

2020-02-19T12:44:04  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Since the VM box updates the unique pull that fixes current master is this one by stegru https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/293
2020-02-19T12:44:25  <javjarfer[m]> that's the main reason why pull fails since past week
2020-02-19T12:44:26  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - but this pull fails for me
2020-02-19T12:44:51  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: but it passes CI, are you using the new VM?
2020-02-19T12:45:00  <javjarfer[m]> any specific failure?
2020-02-19T12:45:47  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, the processHandling failure which is in progress here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/294
2020-02-19T12:46:51  <jhernandez> Bosmon: haha, I was about to go and add an "ok to test" too :P
2020-02-19T12:47:37  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: aha, had no clue of this bug, I haven't seen it before, it's something we can see in the VM boxes?
2020-02-19T12:48:06  <jhernandez> I guess we can discuss our strategy for getting our windows ci back on the track - we need to propagate updates over to gpii-app
2020-02-19T12:48:20  <Bosmon> I'm also very concerned that this "new VM" means that we are also doing no testing on Windows 10 builds prior to 1903
2020-02-19T12:48:22  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: that means that I need to update the current settings definitions in my pulls, so they pass the new system
2020-02-19T12:48:43  <javjarfer[m]> I will use GPII-4344 as a template for doing that
2020-02-19T12:48:47  <the-t-in-rtf> the new tests, yes
2020-02-19T12:49:03  <the-t-in-rtf> great, happy to help if you get stuck, as I had to fix a few dozen variations
2020-02-19T12:49:05  <stegru> :(
2020-02-19T12:49:18  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: there are no new tests in those pulls, the preference sets for the users are the ones that are failing validation
2020-02-19T12:49:36  <jhernandez> Bosmon: there's a ticket to add ci passes on 1809 - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4195
2020-02-19T12:50:06  <Bosmon> jhernandez - that's really great
2020-02-19T12:50:40  <jhernandez> we just need to get some cycles from Alfredo to create the box and setting up the ci to SHIP IT
2020-02-19T12:50:51  <stegru> jiras are like IOU cards.. they're as good as the real thing
2020-02-19T12:50:53  <Bosmon> jhernandez - sounds good
2020-02-19T12:50:57  <Bosmon> How can we get those cycles?
2020-02-19T12:51:10  <jhernandez> well, coordinating with him is enough
2020-02-19T12:51:57  <jhernandez> I know that he always has lots of stuff to work on, but I guess we can get him to work on this if there's a clear need :)
2020-02-19T12:52:01  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], they probably wouldn't have failed before the intra-application settings work
2020-02-19T12:52:31  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, the new tests are the ones of mine that were merged into master, I mean
2020-02-19T12:52:41  <the-t-in-rtf> that are reporting the issue
2020-02-19T12:53:03  <jhernandez> Bosmon: also, there's a new  channel on slack, ci, which I think is a good place to coordinate our work around CI
2020-02-19T12:54:00  <Bosmon> ok
2020-02-19T12:54:02  <Bosmon> Let me get on it
2020-02-19T12:55:25  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, so, I think I now need to use https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/848 as a reference to update this settings schemas
2020-02-19T12:56:06  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, usually it's just moving around the structure so that the checks are nested under properties: { value: X } }
2020-02-19T12:56:30  <the-t-in-rtf> and adding a check for the path
2020-02-19T12:56:42  <the-t-in-rtf> there are many examples in that pull
2020-02-19T13:12:51  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, this is going to take me some time, since I have a good number of them in the PRs

2020-02-19T15:10:10  <Bosmon> I get an exit argument of null
2020-02-19T15:20:42  <stegru> well

2020-02-19T15:22:18  <stegru> mind you, we can put a plaster over it.. until we use a hard-coded translations

2020-02-19T15:42:59  <Bosmon> stegru - sure
2020-02-19T15:43:23  <Bosmon> But - any idea why it is not producing the message?
2020-02-19T15:51:24  <stegru> well, Bosmon, I presume jqUnit.fail is using .toString(), rather than JSON.stringify?
2020-02-19T15:51:51  <stegru> .fail is being incorrectly used
2020-02-19T15:52:10  <Bosmon> stegru - I don't mean the logged message
2020-02-19T15:52:27  <Bosmon> I mean why the process isn't producing the message with the language info
2020-02-19T15:52:30  <stegru> oh, what's causing the delay?
2020-02-19T15:53:07  <Bosmon> Yes, that
2020-02-19T15:53:23  <stegru> 2 theories..
2020-02-19T15:53:40  <stegru> 10 seconds isn't enough to start a new process, under a heavily loaded system
2020-02-19T15:54:36  <stegru> or, the child process is dealing with memory buffers.. perhaps something isn't being explicitly zeroed, or something like that
2020-02-19T15:55:23  <stegru> either would explain the randomness

2020-02-19T15:58:17  <christop_> Some good news there...
2020-02-19T15:58:42  <stegru> you have the PR?
2020-02-19T15:58:45  <christop_> I found some (published!) core macOS APIs that provide the translated human-readable languages (and country/locale names) :)
2020-02-19T15:58:59  <christop_> stegru whichi PR?
2020-02-19T15:59:03  <stegru> have you came across "CLDR"?
2020-02-19T15:59:27  <stegru> ah no.. i was inferring your good news was there is you have a PR ready :)
2020-02-19T15:59:31  <christop_> "Display names for languages, time zones, territories, scripts and currencies"
2020-02-19T15:59:32  <christop_> Oh sweet :)
2020-02-19T15:59:36  <christop_> https://www.npmjs.com/package/cldr
2020-02-19T15:59:41  <christop_> This is from the Unicode consortium?
2020-02-19T15:59:59  <stegru> i've only just started reading http://cldr.unicode.org/
2020-02-19T16:00:13  <christop_> cldr.unicode.org
2020-02-19T16:00:14  <christop_> yup
2020-02-19T16:00:15  <christop_> sweet
2020-02-19T16:00:18  <christop_> That's a great link!
2020-02-19T16:00:49  <christop_> I wonder if this is where Apple/MSFT got the data from ;)
2020-02-19T16:00:50  <stegru> there's a slight problem with the current implementation, and I'm considering just going towards the hard-coded solution
2020-02-19T16:01:07  <christop_> Not a bad idea.  Should we create a JIRA for this?
2020-02-19T16:01:53  <christop_> I like your idea of getting away from using "not so published" API calls on Windows for the human-readable forms.
2020-02-19T16:02:56  <stegru> well, having a hard-coded list is a maintenance burden - but then, so is undocumented APIs :)

2020-02-19T16:11:58  <christop_> Oh, that's painful to watch.
2020-02-19T16:12:24  <christop_> The JSON database would be good for online usage as well.
2020-02-19T16:13:20  <christop_> As for Morphic on macOS...I'm actually kind of partial now to using Apple's APIs because they list the names a little bit differently (or maybe they just use different country codes than on Windows...they have a whole API just to translate from "Windows codes" too...and the APIs on macOS should make things consistent with the "Preferences > Language" pane.

2020-02-19T20:06:29  <cindyli> Bosmon: there's an issue discovered by clown's GPII-4273 branch when LFM fetches SR from Github. our workflow is:
2020-02-19T20:06:51  <cindyli> 1. "flowManagerReady" is fired when: (1) SR and default settings are fetched from remote URL; (2) kettle server is ready
2020-02-19T20:06:58  <cindyli> https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/GPII-4273iii/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L229-L235
2020-02-19T20:07:52  <cindyli> 2. when "flowManagerReady" is fired: (1) key in "noUser"; (2) when noUser is keyed in, reset to default settings
2020-02-19T20:07:53  <cindyli> https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/GPII-4273iii/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L279-L286
2020-02-19T20:08:30  <cindyli> now when SR is fetched from the remote, it takes much longer for "flowManagerReady" to be fired and for "noUser" to be keyed in

2020-02-19T20:08:54  <cindyli> at the time "flowManagerReady" is ready, kettle is long time ready to serve key in/out requests
2020-02-19T20:10:13  <cindyli> when our test programmatically send key in requests, the workflow gets messed up and becomes:
2020-02-19T20:10:31  <cindyli> 1. the kettle is ready;
2020-02-19T20:10:38  <cindyli> 2. the test user is keyed in
2020-02-19T20:10:47  <cindyli> 3. "flowManagerReady" is fired
2020-02-19T20:11:01  <cindyli> 4. "noUser" is keyed in, which keys out the test user
2020-02-19T20:11:52  <cindyli> 5. when test user key out request is received by LFM, the test user has already been keyed out and now it's "noUser" in the system.
2020-02-19T20:12:07  <cindyli> This causes the keyout to fail
2020-02-19T20:13:20  <cindyli> The solution in my mind is to start the test when noUser has been keyed in and reset to default has completed. it means start the test when "resetAtStartSuccess" is fired
2020-02-19T20:14:05  <cindyli> this also means for the windows auto key-in needs to happen at "resetAtStartSuccess" event is fired
2020-02-19T20:15:19  <cindyli> Bosmon: what do you think about this solution?
2020-02-19T20:19:02  <cindyli> i imagine you might say: fix the core to only process http requests when "resetAtStartSuccess" is fired, which I don't know how to implement :-(

2020-02-19T20:28:54  <cindyli> well, to fix the core, not only the timing to process http requests needs to be taken care, also the process timing for function calls such as lifecycleManager.performLogin(), performProximityTriggered() etc
2020-02-19T20:46:28  <sgithens> cindyli: The refactored matchmaker utils (now in the lifecycle utils) work well, thanks!
2020-02-19T20:47:45  <cindyli> great

2020-02-19T21:05:36  <Bosmon> cindyli - somehow the VM build failed again for your gpii-app pull
2020-02-19T21:06:38  <Bosmon> I think it is indeed something to do with the mismatched .NET SDK version
2020-02-19T21:06:57  <cindyli> oh, well
2020-02-19T21:08:22  <cindyli> Bosmon: shall I do some debugging to find out if it's the code problem
2020-02-19T21:08:46  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think your proposed solution to the test race is good - you should just delay the test fixtures to start on noUser keyin
2020-02-19T21:08:54  <Bosmon> cindyli - no, there is no need for you to debug
2020-02-19T21:09:09  <Bosmon> I think the fix for gpii-app will either have to come from Alfredo or Christopher
2020-02-19T21:09:20  <cindyli> ok. cool.
2020-02-19T21:11:56  <Bosmon> I have asked about it in our shiny new #ops Slack channel : P
2020-02-19T21:12:03  <Bosmon> er #ci ops Slack channel
2020-02-19T21:13:44  <cindyli> good to know there's a #ci slack channel, although i don't seem to have access to it
2020-02-19T21:14:31  <Bosmon> I think you can just join it
2020-02-19T21:14:33  <cindyli> that's ok as long as i have access to #ops slack channel
2020-02-19T21:14:34  <Bosmon> Once you know its name
2020-02-19T21:14:48  <Bosmon> The interface is rather poorly worded for Slack
2020-02-19T21:16:30  <cindyli> "browser channel" doesn't give me a channel named "ci"
2020-02-19T21:17:19  <cindyli> i think i found it. great
2020-02-19T21:19:18  <cindyli> no, i was wrong… nvm, i have #ops channel
