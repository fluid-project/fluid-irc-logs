2020-02-14T10:57:35  <Bosmon> Hi there javjarfer[m] - I'm just looking at your https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/847 - but I see there are somehow no changes in it?
2020-02-14T10:59:39  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: good morning, that's a github issue because of the previous merge of that same pull jhernandez knows about the issue
2020-02-14T10:59:56  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - ok, I will check locally to see if there seems to be some content : P
2020-02-14T11:01:01  <javjarfer[m]> If I understand him well, you wont see changes unless you do a revert of the previous revert, to leave the thing like before the merge, but you know, that's modifying history and ugly
2020-02-14T11:01:50  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I have checked locally and there is still no content to the pull
2020-02-14T11:02:31  <Bosmon> That is, if I check out the most recent version of your branch and merge it up with master, there is no diff
2020-02-14T11:03:05  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - you will need to revert the revert in your branch otherwise there is nothing to merge
2020-02-14T11:03:07  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: maybe the issue is with git itself, yes, I think this post in stackoverflow describes the problem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27852143/how-to-pr-and-merge-again-after-reverting-pr-using-github-revert-button/28497372
2020-02-14T11:03:19  <Bosmon> It isn't modifying history, it is modifying the present :)
2020-02-14T11:03:30  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, I was wrong
2020-02-14T11:04:26  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I think if you just commit a revert of the revert into your branch, the content will reappear there
2020-02-14T11:04:48  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, going for it
2020-02-14T11:04:58  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - awesome, thanks!
2020-02-14T11:06:32  <Bosmon> Also, re your pull https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/284/files
2020-02-14T11:06:42  <Bosmon> I still don't see you have added any further material to run as part of UnitTests.js ?
2020-02-14T11:07:09  <Bosmon> In terms of this comment: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/284/files#r376908890

2020-02-14T11:18:59  <javjarfer[m]> they are the same pull adding the same handler, didn't want to update it for not triggering more redundant builds in CI till GPII-4152 passes, that probably will be when stegru https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/293 is merged

2020-02-14T12:10:39  <Bosmon> Also, you have a test failure
2020-02-14T12:13:02  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: the relevant changes for the internal tests executions are done in https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/283/files#diff-08d965238539c1d980d9d76050e7d1a2R569
2020-02-14T12:13:20  <javjarfer[m]> the test failure is due to ```00:08:21.378:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Windows\resources\Themes\aero.theme'
2020-02-14T12:13:20  <javjarfer[m]> Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Windows\resources\Themes\aero.theme'```
2020-02-14T12:13:41  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, this is what I commented : P
2020-02-14T12:13:52  <javjarfer[m]> which is failing because of changes in registry keys values in the new windows box
2020-02-14T12:14:13  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: that failures is also present in master, and the previously quoted pull request by stegru solves it
2020-02-14T12:14:42  <Bosmon> #283 solves it?
2020-02-14T12:14:59  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/293
2020-02-14T12:15:02  <Bosmon> ok

2020-02-14T13:43:46  <christop_> (wave) Bosmon
2020-02-14T13:43:53  <Bosmon> I wonder if you'd be able to glance an eye over javjarfer[m] ' s pull request here at some point: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/284/files#diff-d073917ddda3c0bf0306578c6b882a51R36
2020-02-14T13:44:03  <Bosmon> Especially this section which modifies the tool chain build scripts
2020-02-14T13:44:19  <Bosmon> To see what its implications might be for your upcoming update of our tool chain to MSVC 2017
2020-02-14T13:44:39  <christop_> Ah yes.
2020-02-14T13:44:52  <Bosmon> Also particularly this change in platform settings here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/284/files#diff-8b49d7554433c0cb2f8d728d3135025dR20
2020-02-14T13:45:24  <Bosmon> That's brilliant, thanks!
2020-02-14T13:45:34  <christop_> With VS2017, there's a command-line option for installing VS2017 + build tools.  Ideally silently and directly, without any need for indirection through another app.
2020-02-14T13:46:39  <christop_> x86 _should_ work on 64-bit Intel/AMD platforms; the whole point of x64 is that it's a superset of x86.
2020-02-14T13:46:54  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.178.16> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-14T13:46:56  <christop_> More generally: why can't we do CI in both x86 _and_ x64?
2020-02-14T13:47:31  <christop_> And why can't we pass the platform architecture as an environment variable to npm and to MSBuild as the same (or as a command-line arg).
2020-02-14T13:48:12  <christop_> If you want, I can look at rebuilding these during the macOS+Windows xplat merge to target platforms through environment variables or command-line args.
2020-02-14T13:49:23  <christop_> PS the architecture tag in node-npm is "ia32" rather than "x86"...
2020-02-14T13:50:10  <Bosmon> christop_ - that would be very helpful
2020-02-14T13:50:26  <Bosmon> Do you think it would be best to hold off merging this pull until your xplat work is more progressed?
2020-02-14T13:50:32  <christop_> Anyway, since win32 API calls use pointers (and bitness-aligned structs)...we should ideally be testing on both ia32 and amd64 in CI.
2020-02-14T13:50:55  <christop_> Doing this a the same time as xplat makes a _lot_ of sense.  No logic in duplicating efforst.
2020-02-14T13:51:05  <christop_> * efforst
2020-02-14T13:51:08  <christop_> * efforts
2020-02-14T13:51:16  <christop_> MacBook keyboard.  Grumble grumble grumble.
2020-02-14T14:00:42  <christop_> We should definitely try to move away from MSBuild 4 in any case (i.e. the VS2010/VS2012 build system).  I'll dig through this next week (specifically with the Windows Volume Settings Handler).

2020-02-14T14:23:57  <javjarfer[m]> christop_, Bosmon the reason for that hardcoded x64 is that the project uses pointer arithmetic and reverse engineering of interfaces that doesn't have conditional compilation for different architectures. The handler itself have never been tested against a x86 Windows, and because we don't have boxes for x86, and the target platform in all our next deployments was x86 no efforts were carried out for that
2020-02-14T14:24:32  <Bosmon> stegru - ever seen anything like this? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4353
2020-02-14T14:26:29  <javjarfer[m]> (sorry, "our next deployment are in "x64", wrote the incorrect arch)
2020-02-14T14:27:46  <stegru> looks like a poorly written test, Bosmon
2020-02-14T14:28:05  <Bosmon> stegru - actually it seems to be consistent now, I've got it a few times in a row ...
2020-02-14T14:28:15  <Bosmon> Although I don't think the changes in the branch I am testing are relevant
2020-02-14T14:29:28  <stegru> unless you've changed anything in /gpii-service, i highly doubt it
2020-02-14T14:30:25  <Bosmon> I'm testing your GPII-4343 branch
2020-02-14T14:30:28  <Bosmon> I'll revert to testing master
2020-02-14T14:33:44  <stegru> i ran the test in my brain, and it should have passed

2020-02-14T14:41:48  <christop_> javjarfer[m] -- that code is living inside a service which runs in parallel to Electron?  [If running in Electron it should be 32-bit, since gpii-app is only being built as "arch=ia32" right now correct?]
2020-02-14T14:42:46  <christop_> In any case, we do need to keep ia32 around since Surface Pro X and all the education notebooks running Windows on ARM either need ia32 (emulated on the arm64 processors) or a native arm64 build.  And we aren't to "native ARM64" yet.
2020-02-14T14:43:50  <jhernandez> christop_:  right, we need to keep supporting ia32 anyway
2020-02-14T14:44:35  <jhernandez> and yes, the service it's ... a service, which launches the electron app
2020-02-14T14:45:10  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/tree/master/gpii-service
2020-02-14T14:52:22  <stegru> that 64bit process is launched by the electron process - it needs to match the system it's running on - so, we need both versions
2020-02-14T14:53:55  <javjarfer[m]> christop_: we are talking about the code here https://github.com/GPII/windows/tree/master/settingsHelper, is a separate executable that is being called by the morphic node / electron process
2020-02-14T14:54:29  <stegru> it's only essential for very few preferences, so for now it (should) fail gracefully on 32-bit arch since we have no quick way of testing
2020-02-14T14:54:35  <javjarfer[m]> btw I don't think it's reasonable to stop a PR for a future change in the build system, the necessity of that change is not so big as the settings that pull unblocks

2020-02-14T15:01:50  <jhernandez> but in my opinion, wouldn't be more interesting to test against different versions of windows, rather than 32/64?
2020-02-14T15:02:03  <jhernandez> just saying ...
2020-02-14T15:02:26  <javjarfer[m]> anyway I think that right now is putting too much effort into something that is not a priority right now, or is supporting 32 bit windows in the short term goals?
2020-02-14T15:02:53  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I agree with jhernandez , we should probably spend more effort into Windows versioning
2020-02-14T15:03:16  <stegru> there are no current users on 32-bit... however, Gregg wants to target the low powered ARM devices
2020-02-14T15:03:19  <jhernandez> I mean, I really don't care, but I do know that setting up our build chains in the past it's been a pain in the ass
2020-02-14T15:04:17  <stegru> I think testing on a standard 32-bit would be useless, considering any real 32-bit users would actually be running on emulated x86 (on ARM)

2020-02-14T15:05:01  <javjarfer[m]> stegru, jhernandez , yes, also we already have some problems right with the current architecture in CI, Windows CI fails way more than it should
2020-02-14T15:05:33  <christop_> stegru -- for better or worse, as long as Microsoft ships an ia32/x86 version of Windows we'll have to support it :(
2020-02-14T15:06:12  <christop_> Luckily we don't have to support ARM32 since Surface RT was killed off.  Funny enough the new Window on ARM (which is ARM64) is backwards-compatible but I just pretend that ARM32 never existed.
2020-02-14T15:07:36  <christop_> jhernandez -- (s/we/he | one), depending on if one is speaking British or American or international English.  Or perhaps it.  One can choose one's own pronouns too I suppose.
2020-02-14T15:08:28  <christop_> I suddenly want to build a DFA for pronouns.  I will resist the temptation.  And will go back on topic. :)

2020-02-14T15:11:33  <stegru> well, I think there are more differences between different windows versions than bitness
2020-02-14T15:12:10  <stegru> so if there were to be a larger test surface, that should be done first
2020-02-14T15:12:47  <stegru> perhaps providing QA with a 32-bit VM would be sufficient

2020-02-14T15:18:56  <christop_> stegru -- just as a side note, some of the premium Windows devices (Surface Pro X comes to mind) run on ARM...  They're really fast machines...but they don't run amd64 apps (at least not yet...I assume limited compatibility support will be coming within the next few years...but it'll probably take a decade or more to get some of the more recent instruction subsets running under emulation)
2020-02-14T15:19:23  <christop_> stegru -- just FYI: I'm testing all the "buttons" in Morphic under both ia32 and amd64 with the xplat merge.
2020-02-14T15:19:35  <stegru> ok
2020-02-14T15:19:51  <christop_> There are some win32 API differences around _structs_ (not only alignment but also sometimes fields that are added/subtracted) in 32-bit vs 64-bit scenarios.

2020-02-14T16:00:32  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you have a chance to look at gmoss' summary about our suggestions on his pull request about using one model value or two model values to track which one of the two editing step is showing/hiding - https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/56#issuecomment-585983620
2020-02-14T16:01:01  <cindyli> i personally lean towards having one model value to simplify the wiring and logic that need to be implemented
2020-02-14T16:01:25  <cindyli> and i'd like to hear your opinion
2020-02-14T16:06:38  <jhernandez> cindyli, jhung:  the good ones are in gdrive
2020-02-14T16:06:55  <jhernandez> but not sure where
2020-02-14T16:09:13  <jhernandez> ok
2020-02-14T16:09:20  <jhernandez> I think I found'em
2020-02-14T16:12:00  <jhernandez> cindyli: I think these are the good ones https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1r4R-AKojdA0LLyA27tDGRoi1UijBZsSH
2020-02-14T16:12:05  <jhernandez> jhung: ^
2020-02-14T16:12:22  <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez and stegru
2020-02-14T16:12:44  <Bosmon> cindyli - the simplification seems incredibly marginal
2020-02-14T16:12:47  <jhernandez> and yeah, stegru's link would work too
2020-02-14T16:12:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - why would you like one model value?
2020-02-14T16:13:43  <jhung> Thanks jhernandez!
2020-02-14T16:15:00  <cindyli> Bosmon: with 2 boolean model values, 1. the sync up between them is required; 2. model listeners for both of them are required; 3. actions performed for these 2 model states will be almost identical with true/false being flipped
2020-02-14T16:15:22  <Bosmon> cindyli - isn't 3 an ideal thing?
2020-02-14T16:15:28  <Bosmon> It implies that the actions can be removed
2020-02-14T16:15:45  <Bosmon> I thought it was the whole point of model driven development : P
2020-02-14T16:17:36  <cindyli> Bosmon: what do you mean "actions can be removed"?
2020-02-14T16:18:07  <Bosmon> If the actions are almost identical - doesn't this mean that we can factor out the differences?
2020-02-14T16:18:42  <Bosmon> That is - the making of something visible when its model flag is "true" is a generic action
2020-02-14T16:19:02  <cindyli> that's true.
2020-02-14T16:19:32  <Bosmon> The action of making something visible when a different model flag is false is not generic
2020-02-14T16:20:18  <cindyli> i was thinking of having one model value indicating which step is on at the moment, such as {"step": "editing"}
2020-02-14T16:20:53  <cindyli> the "step" value could be "editing" or "metadata", Bosmon
2020-02-14T16:20:59  <Bosmon> cindyli - well, that's certainly a good possibility, but it would still imply then transforming that model value to a hash of flags indicating visibility
2020-02-14T16:21:14  <cindyli> well. ok
2020-02-14T16:22:06  <Bosmon> cindyli - e.g. with this one: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#fluidtransformsarraytosetmembership
2020-02-14T16:22:31  <Bosmon> Shame it only seems to take an array
2020-02-14T16:23:38  <cindyli> a powerful transform
2020-02-14T16:23:43  <cindyli> still

2020-02-14T16:26:49  <Bosmon> cindyli - A model state of a string is certainly better than a boolean which implicitly restricts to only two possibilities and expects listeners to react to a "false" value by producing a visible control
2020-02-14T16:27:33  <cindyli> cannot agree more

2020-02-14T16:29:14  <Bosmon> Three times now I've ended up with a really devastating kind of failure where the entire command window running the tests appears to have crashed out
2020-02-14T16:29:37  <Bosmon> And the system is left in a terrible state where the mouse buttons are swapped, the mouse cursor movement is enabled, the magnifier is on, and narrator is on
2020-02-14T16:29:48  <Bosmon> It took quite a while to figure out how to get out of that : P
2020-02-14T16:30:05  <Bosmon> So far I'm unable to reproduce this kind of crash on master
