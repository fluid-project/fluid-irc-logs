2019-10-22T12:00:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you still have a bit of outstanding review on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/962
2019-10-22T12:01:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. making my rounds to catch up on JIRAs today.. haven't had time in the last couple of weeks to look at anything, sadly.
2019-10-22T12:01:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for the reminder though
2019-10-22T12:02:08  <Bosmon> no worries!
2019-10-22T12:02:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, I'm just running the tests for my FLUID-6148 branch for UIO+ and my tests are failing now.. so I'm going to dig into that, hopefully it's quick
2019-10-22T12:02:39  <Justin_o> but actually I guess I should update the dev release that branch is using too
2019-10-22T12:03:43  <Justin_o> are there any big changes recently in the Potentia II work?
2019-10-22T12:13:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: can you remind me what this error refers to "Couldn't locate resource loader for resource spec ,[object Object],; it should have one of the fields ,resourceText,promiseFunc,dataSource,XHR,url filled out"
2019-10-22T12:14:08  <Bosmon> Justin_o well ...... it says you need to have filled out one of those fields : P
2019-10-22T12:14:22  <Justin_o> haha, I mean, what might have caused it
2019-10-22T12:14:50  <Justin_o> interestingly my tests for UIO+ use infusion-all, at first I though it might have been a missing dependency but that couldn't be it
2019-10-22T12:15:09  <Bosmon> It's possible you used to have the skeleton of a resource in some grade somewhere without the proper fields filled in, and you used to depend on it being ignored quietly?
2019-10-22T12:15:12  <Justin_o> so it must be something related to change in the structure, but I can't see any related changes in my previous commits.
2019-10-22T12:15:28  <Justin_o> hmm

2019-10-22T12:51:54  <Justin_o> okay, needed to update the PanelsTestUtils file that I had pulled in from Infusion. There were some changes to that file around template fetching

2019-10-22T13:52:12  <cindyli> colinclark: Morphic installed on the Microsoft Surface should be working. off the top of the head, the only odd is the RFC cards are not supported. You need to use USB keys to demo key-ins
2019-10-22T13:52:23  <colinclark> ok
2019-10-22T13:52:29  <colinclark> there are some USB sticks with the Surface?
2019-10-22T13:52:32  <cindyli> yes
2019-10-22T13:53:01  <cindyli> there's a box in the locker that has all things you need for the demo

2019-10-22T14:29:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I wonder if you have any ideas on this. I have tests that aren't running in UIO+ due to the table of contents. It seems that the message loader is not firing the event we're waiting for
2019-10-22T14:31:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: specifically this event in the test is not being hit https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/FLUID-6148/tests/browser/js/domEnactorTests.js#L673-L675
2019-10-22T14:32:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: which I think might be related to the is expander https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/FLUID-6148/extension/src/content_scripts/domEnactor.js#L390-L396

2019-10-22T14:36:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting.. I'm actually getting a silent failure on the resource fetch.. fortunately it's showing up in my console log of the component.. for some reason the message bundle URL is pointing at the template URL.. so it's having a parse error but it's not being reported
2019-10-22T14:37:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - from what I can see I've preserved all this structure in fluid.prefs.enactor.tableOfContents in my branch
2019-10-22T14:38:15  <Bosmon> So there shouldn't be any particularly different behaviour with the expander
2019-10-22T14:38:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, you need to subscribe specifically for resource error events
2019-10-22T14:38:50  <Justin_o> oh really.. how does one do that
2019-10-22T14:40:59  <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6148/src/framework/core/js/ResourceLoader.js#L784
2019-10-22T14:41:06  <Bosmon> I'm pretty sure this event has always been there....

2019-10-22T14:42:04  <Bosmon> You got your onResourcesLoaded event even if they didn't load ....
2019-10-22T14:42:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so I've tracked down why I'm getting the wrong URL back, it's related to sinon-chrome setup I have.. so I'll need to fix that myself

2019-10-22T14:42:35  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but I guess it would have caused another error along the way that would have broken everything?
2019-10-22T14:42:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, under the old model you looked for your "resourceText" and then found it mysteriously wasn't there
2019-10-22T14:43:40  <Bosmon> Under the new framework failure to load a resource is much more serious and can even bomb out the construction of your whole component tree if it happens during startup

2019-10-22T14:55:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I see, so in the component construction case is there something automatically listening to the error case?
2019-10-22T14:56:05  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, if a failure occurs in a resource, e.g. which is consumed in your model, the entire tree will bomb out
2019-10-22T14:56:23  <Bosmon> If it is just some other kind of resource which you have configured yourself, you need to deal with the errors yourself

2019-10-22T14:57:05  <Justin_o> I suppose actually the setup of the Table of Contents is kind of like that as the construction of related components are dependent.. in this case though it is messages as opposed to templates.. is there something that we should do to upgrade the toc to use the automatic binding approach?
