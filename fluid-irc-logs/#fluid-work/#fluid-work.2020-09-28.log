2020-09-28T14:39:49  <michelled> hi clown, does 2:00 work for you to check in?
2020-09-28T14:41:24  <clown> michelled:  yes.  I had think about it a bit, but that should be okay.
2020-09-28T14:41:41  <clown> zoom and the idrc room?
2020-09-28T14:42:19  <michelled> sounds good!
2020-09-28T14:42:28  <clown> see you then!
2020-09-28T14:42:29  <michelled> idrc general room you mean?
2020-09-28T14:42:55  <clown> yes — I'd type the number here, but I can't remembe if that's secure.
2020-09-28T16:06:55  <colinclark> Justin_o, michelled: I just need two minutes if that’s ok?
2020-09-28T16:07:08  <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2020-09-28T16:07:08  <michelled> me too, so it's perfect
2020-09-28T16:56:37  *** clown is now known as clown_afk
2020-09-28T17:17:51  <greatislander> hi greatislander[m]
2020-09-28T17:33:58  *** clown_afk is now known as clonw
2020-09-28T18:03:24  <michelled> clown, I'm in the general room
2020-09-28T18:04:02  <clown> okay, it appears I'm in the standup room.  One moment please.
2020-09-28T18:05:14  <clown> hmmm..   I don't actually have the general room on my history list.  To short circuit this, the standup room it empty; is that okay with you?
2020-09-28T18:05:27  <michelled> yup! be right there
2020-09-28T18:41:10  <colinclark> Bosmon, cindyli: Is there a way we could do some speculative costing for cloud infrastructure for We Count?
2020-09-28T18:41:53  <colinclark> I’m particularly interested in if you could imagine, using the Azure calculator, a baseline of Azure usage so we can work with Microsoft to have them share credits as in-kind
2020-09-28T18:41:56  <colinclark> which they committed to doing
2020-09-28T18:42:07  <colinclark> gtirloni has started doing this for our other infrastructure
2020-09-28T18:42:41  <colinclark> but since you’re thinking about building with things like Azure Functions, it would be good to have a ballpark guess of how we might use it
2020-09-28T18:46:40  <Bosmon> colinclark - sounds really interesting
2020-09-28T18:46:49  <Bosmon> I guess, as with all of these exercises, we need some kind of usage model : P
2020-09-28T18:46:53  <colinclark> yes
2020-09-28T18:46:58  <colinclark> we can invent a model
2020-09-28T18:47:05  <colinclark> and the use the project to validate and refine the model
2020-09-28T18:47:27  <colinclark> a bit like what we did way back in the day with the famous “GPII costing document”
2020-09-28T18:47:44  <colinclark> which turned out to perhaps be the most realistic model of use the GPII ever encountered
2020-09-28T18:47:50  <colinclark> despite being entirely speculative
2020-09-28T18:47:52  <Bosmon> Yes
2020-09-28T18:48:23  <Bosmon> Will we be imagining users contributing data as well as just operating the viz?
2020-09-28T18:48:48  <Bosmon> cindyli and I realised we didn't need to redeploy the site at all when the data is updated, since it could just pull the data from a github URL
2020-09-28T18:55:31  <Bosmon> It's hard for me to imagine that at this stage we would use more than the free tier of Azure
2020-09-28T18:57:05  <Bosmon> Say we executed a minimum resource function (100ms for 128MB) every minute for a month -
2020-09-28T18:57:30  <Bosmon> This would only consume about 500GB-s of resource, less than 1% of the free grant
2020-09-28T18:58:00  <Bosmon> Since the majority of the resources would be consumed within netlify from the github action trigger
2020-09-28T18:58:32  <Bosmon> I guess, more ambitiously, we could scope out replacing netlify entirely but that seems a large scale thing to consider
2020-09-28T19:09:36  <colinclark> interesting
2020-09-28T19:09:38  <colinclark> that’s a pretty big scale, yes
2020-09-28T19:10:00  <colinclark> is there the issue, as in the GPII cloud days, where we need development instances etc.?
2020-09-28T19:10:13  <Bosmon> If we're not in that scenario, then we're just seeing Azure Functions in the role of a home-grown replacement for zapier or integromat
2020-09-28T19:10:22  <colinclark> so that we have to factor not only use by users but also resourced consumed in the development and testing process
2020-09-28T19:10:55  <colinclark> ok
2020-09-28T19:11:41  <Bosmon> And it has occurred to us now that most plausible "data visualisations" proper will have the rendering done on the client, even with a static site
2020-09-28T19:12:09  <colinclark> and the static sites will continue to be hosted on Netlify’s infrastructure?
2020-09-28T19:12:14  <Bosmon> Yes
2020-09-28T19:12:24  <colinclark> Are any of the big cloud providers starting to take note of the Netlfiy idiom?
2020-09-28T19:12:38  <colinclark> gtirloni: You might know this better than me
2020-09-28T19:12:38  <Bosmon> Netlify does so much for us that it seems like poor economics to try to write it just yet
2020-09-28T19:12:44  <Bosmon> rewrite it
2020-09-28T19:12:46  <colinclark> yes
2020-09-28T19:12:54  <colinclark> sounds like a really bad idea :)
2020-09-28T19:13:04  <colinclark> at least until they get bought up by IBM
2020-09-28T19:13:10  <colinclark> then it might be crucially necessary
2020-09-28T19:13:26  <colinclark> but perhaps we can be hopeful that Netlify will just be bought by MS and folded into Azure and Github
2020-09-28T19:14:56  * gtirloni catching up on messages
2020-09-28T19:16:06  <gtirloni> Azure has "Azure App Service" which is similar
2020-09-28T19:16:13  <Bosmon> That would be tough, since it would involve a complete change of all the Netlify APIs
2020-09-28T19:16:28  <Bosmon> Which by and large are simply "pass-throughs" for the equivalent Lambda ones
2020-09-28T19:16:41  <Bosmon> You've experienced this yourself in Flocking : P
2020-09-28T19:17:09  <gtirloni> what bothers me about netlify is how they're always talking about how many users they have... it was 300k, 500k, 800k, now I think they mentioned 1m (I'm going by memory). as in, appeasing to buyers.. but I might be reading too much between the lines there
2020-09-28T19:17:56  <gtirloni> the service is great, no doubt
2020-09-28T19:18:07  <cindyli> I'm also looking at the cost of Azure SQL database as a replacement of the free Airtable. the cheapest option is $983.78 per month for 3 year reserved. quite expensive
2020-09-28T19:18:43  <gtirloni> cindyli: "Azure SQL" is "MS SQL" with a different name.. you may want to look at "Azure MySQL/MariaDB/PgSQL"
2020-09-28T19:18:56  <cindyli> ok
2020-09-28T19:18:59  <gtirloni> "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" is how they name it
2020-09-28T19:19:15  <Bosmon> Yes
2020-09-28T19:19:28  <Bosmon> Arure's Postgres was always one of the attractive options when we did our GPII database evaluation
2020-09-28T19:19:42  <Bosmon> Since they've put a lot of work into making it scale smoothly, far more than Google
2020-09-28T19:21:17  <cindyli> Azure Database for PostgreSQL or MySQL is much cheaper, around $60 monthly if 3 years reserved
2020-09-28T19:22:00  <cindyli> pay as you go option is $138 monthly. cheaper but still a bit pricing
2020-09-28T19:22:39  <Bosmon> cindyli - is there some kind of option for the database to fire external triggers on certain updates?
2020-09-28T19:22:53  <gtirloni> I think we can use it like we use our self-hosted database servers.. hosting multiple databases, not a single one. But I don't have much experience with that in the context of serverless
2020-09-28T19:22:56  <Bosmon> Is it in effect a standard docker container with a db in it or is it all locked down
2020-09-28T19:23:51  <gtirloni> i.e. you're paying for cpu/mem and the managing of the service.. if you can stuff all your database on a small instance, it's fair game
2020-09-28T19:23:56  <gtirloni> *databases
2020-09-28T19:25:49  <colinclark> gtirloni: I think you’re reading the Netlify numbers game correctly
2020-09-28T19:26:13  <colinclark> you get a billion dollar payout if you can show you have enough captured users
2020-09-28T19:26:58  <colinclark> Azure Postgres could be useful for our “UIO Cloud” implementation
2020-09-28T19:27:33  <colinclark> and keep in mind cindyli that MS will be donating those costs (though $1000/mo is wild and inconceivable even then)
2020-09-28T19:28:48  <colinclark> Bosmon: As part of this process, we won’t have self-hosted servers any more
2020-09-28T19:29:12  <colinclark> that said, we may still choose containers or VMs with our own databases running in them, rather than the fully hosted services
2020-09-28T19:29:17  <colinclark> that’s up to gtirloni of course
2020-09-28T19:31:16  <gtirloni> that's an option.. I need to run the numbers a bit better once we're actually migrating things
2020-09-28T19:32:04  <colinclark> right exactly
2020-09-28T19:32:35  <colinclark> long term, i guess, we’ll want the IDRC infrastructure to stay within the range of our current data centre tax from IT :)
2020-09-28T19:32:47  <colinclark> so somethings we might have to ditch or host elsewhere for free
2020-09-28T19:33:10  <cindyli> Bosmon: this MS Azure article talks about PostgreSQL’s https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html functionality for sending notification event. seems possible - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/blog/event-processing-with-azure-database-for-postgresql-and-azure-event-grid-integration/
2020-09-28T19:40:56  <Bosmon> cindyli - seems nasty
2020-09-28T19:41:12  <Bosmon> We don't want to send a notification to an "event grid", we want to send it out of the system entirely : P
2020-09-28T19:41:18  <colinclark> alanharnum do you have some time to do some creative thinking with me and a few others this week?
2020-09-28T19:41:28  <colinclark> i’m thinking maybe you, Bosmon, cindyli, and Justin_o
2020-09-28T19:41:42  <colinclark> related to this wiki page i’ve been writing, and the idea of “UIO Cloud”
2020-09-28T19:41:44  <colinclark> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/FLOE+Infrastructure+for+Individualized+Learning
2020-09-28T19:41:44  <cindyli> Bosmon: why out of the system? what's the use case
2020-09-28T19:41:55  <Bosmon> cindyli - we want it, primarily, to trigger netlify builds
2020-09-28T19:42:39  <cindyli> i thought we wanna host everything with Azure to replace netlify. am i wrong?
2020-09-28T19:43:29  <cindyli> ya, i don't think azure notification and event system can reach out of its own system
2020-09-28T19:44:02  <Bosmon> cindyli - colinclark just remarked that replacing netlify was a really bad idea : P
2020-09-28T19:44:22  <colinclark> well i did
2020-09-28T19:44:34  <colinclark> i also did ask if Azure had infrastructure that was similar
2020-09-28T19:44:38  <colinclark> out of an idle curiosity
2020-09-28T19:44:59  <colinclark> to which Gio mentioned their “App Service”
2020-09-28T19:45:15  <colinclark> so you’re both right, cindyli and Bosmon :)
2020-09-28T19:47:37  <Bosmon> I imagine that we could cobble something together somewhat resembling Netlify out of "Azure pipelines" - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/deploy-pull-request-builds?view=azure-devops
2020-09-28T19:57:31  <Bosmon> It looks like we might have slight more control over the retention policy for built artefacts than we do with Netlify - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/policies/retention?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml
2020-09-28T19:57:54  <Bosmon> But it's not clear it's easy to configure the lifetime model that seemed most natural - that builds should be retained as long as the branch still existed in github
2020-09-28T19:58:53  <colinclark> yes
2020-09-28T19:59:07  <alanharnum> colinclark: sure, I am available
2020-09-28T19:59:12  <colinclark> cool
2020-09-28T19:59:22  <alanharnum> this looks very relevant to CISL's concerns
2020-09-28T19:59:33  <colinclark> that’s what i’d hoped :)
2020-09-28T19:59:37  <colinclark> tomorrow after 2 pm EDT?
2020-09-28T19:59:51  <colinclark> or sometime on Friday?
2020-09-28T20:00:03  <colinclark> Bosmon, cindyli, Justin_o do you have preferences for when?
2020-09-28T20:00:24  <alanharnum> colinclark: I am free 2-3 tomorrow or after 4
2020-09-28T20:00:48  <Justin_o> colinclark: there is a design crit at 2pm tomorrow
2020-09-28T20:01:02  <colinclark> right
2020-09-28T20:01:09  <colinclark> so will it be an hour?
2020-09-28T20:01:32  <Justin_o> colinclark: I'm not sure. greatislander and jhung do you have a thought at how long the design crit will take tomorrow?
2020-09-28T20:02:03  <colinclark> I guess either way we’d be looking at 4 pm EDT to fit alanharnum’s availability
2020-09-28T20:02:13  <cindyli> all these times work for me
2020-09-28T20:02:13  <jhung> Justin_o, colinclark - we're aiming for 1h, ending 3p.
2020-09-28T20:02:42  <Justin_o> colinclark: I could do 4 to 4:45pm tomorrow
2020-09-28T20:03:04  <colinclark> Bosmon: that’s 9 pm for you, I think. Too late?
2020-09-28T20:03:35  <Bosmon> Yeah that is ok
2020-09-28T20:03:40  <Bosmon> Noisy creatures should be virtually in bed
2020-09-28T20:04:20  <colinclark> :)
2020-09-28T20:04:32  <colinclark> ok, let’s do it
2020-09-28T20:05:45  <colinclark> i sent a calendar nivite
2020-09-28T20:06:39  <Justin_o> colinclark: got it, thanks
