2020-06-24T16:01:52  <jhernandez> hey gpii'ers!! arch meeting time :)
2020-06-24T16:05:47  <greatislander> I missed something at the end of standup, what was the terrible project name colinclark?
2020-06-24T16:05:56  <greatislander> (saw in chat just before leaving the meeting)
2020-06-24T16:06:03  <colinclark> it’s a european project
2020-06-24T16:06:20  <colinclark> related to gender issues in science, technology, and innovation
2020-06-24T16:06:35  <colinclark> so the brilliant acronym they picked for the project nme is “Gender STI”
2020-06-24T16:07:12  <colinclark> I guess it’s a good reminder when we pick acronyms to make sure they translate across cultures
2020-06-24T16:07:40  <colinclark> also,  i hate my macbook keyboard so much
2020-06-24T16:07:52  <colinclark> I’m not actually sure what to do, it keeps getting worse
2020-06-24T16:08:01  <colinclark> a number of keys double quite often
2020-06-24T16:08:11  <colinclark> and now my “a” key only works about 75% of the time
2020-06-24T16:08:15  <colinclark> and when it does, it sometimes doubles up too
2020-06-24T16:10:20  <gmoss> colinclark: do you have room in your setup for an external keyboard? I'm sure avtar could make a recommendation, and I'm a big fan of mine
2020-06-24T16:10:29  <gmoss> (I also agree that project's name is unfortunate)
2020-06-24T16:10:55  <colinclark> yeah, have a couple of USB keyboards
2020-06-24T16:11:11  <colinclark> the problem is that i do like to vary my location throughout the day to avoid too much physical pain
2020-06-24T16:11:28  <colinclark> so i only connect to the USB keyboard maybe half the time
2020-06-24T16:11:50  <colinclark> now that apple is switch to ARM, my next laptop will presumably be from Dell or Lenovo or Microsoft
2020-06-24T16:12:02  <colinclark> but in the meantime this keyboard is just getting worse
2020-06-24T16:12:06  <gmoss> ah gotcha. Is the machine still covered by any sort of warranty?
2020-06-24T16:12:15  <colinclark> yeah, it is
2020-06-24T16:12:23  <colinclark> presumably i’ll have to ship it back to them
2020-06-24T16:12:28  <gmoss> less than ideal
2020-06-24T16:12:34  <colinclark> which leaves me with a 7 year old chromebook to work on :(
2020-06-24T16:12:40  <colinclark> probably doable, actually
2020-06-24T16:13:12  <gmoss> colinclark: I have a 2015 (I think) macbook here, if you need an alternative
2020-06-24T16:13:21  <colinclark> nah, i’ll figure something out
2020-06-24T16:13:28  <colinclark> as you say, external keyboard
2020-06-24T16:13:32  <colinclark> but thank you
2020-06-24T16:13:36  <gmoss> :)
2020-06-24T16:14:19  <gmoss> I was having similar issues with my mouse until recently (when I replaced it), so I know the pain of inputs not lining up with actions. I hope you find relief!
2020-06-24T16:19:26  <colinclark> thanks!
2020-06-24T17:39:06  *** christopher is now known as Guest95482
2020-06-24T17:46:27  <sgithens> that's an amazing project name
2020-06-24T17:46:48  <sgithens> and yeah, my macbook 2018 is essentially a desktop machine, since my wrist hurts to type on it
2020-06-24T17:47:08  <sgithens> I replaced the batter on my 2013 macbook (from ifixit) and my plan is to travel with that now
2020-06-24T17:47:30  <sgithens> Bosmon recommended this logitech K800 and I've enjoyed it so far
2020-06-24T17:47:56  <sgithens> colinclark
2020-06-24T17:48:14  <sgithens> also, that is a pretty funny project name
2020-06-24T17:48:45  <colinclark> sgithens
2020-06-24T17:49:03  <colinclark> thank you, i’ll check that keyboard out
2020-06-24T17:49:06  <sgithens> ahhh, it feels good to see this irc chat post gpii. I'm glad everyone is here
2020-06-24T17:49:15  <colinclark> we’re all here
2020-06-24T17:49:18  <sgithens> :)
2020-06-24T17:49:21  <colinclark> and happy to have you be part of our community
2020-06-24T17:49:34  <colinclark> and to support you
2020-06-24T17:49:41  <colinclark> while that particular ship slowly sinks
2020-06-24T17:49:45  <sgithens> Cheers, to the max!
2020-06-24T17:49:59  <colinclark> i have to admit i sometimes get tempted  by the sorts of fancy keyboards that sbates and avtar use
2020-06-24T17:50:54  <sgithens> maybe you can buy one last macbook with the magic keyboards and use your current one for the trade-in value, before the arm switch
2020-06-24T17:52:37  <colinclark> The Last MacBook
2020-06-24T17:53:13  <colinclark> it’s a work machine, so i doubt we’ll be able to trade it in
2020-06-24T17:53:22  <sgithens> hmm
2020-06-24T17:53:22  <colinclark> but hopefully i can get it repaaired at some point
2020-06-24T18:07:33  <Bosmon> Hi guys :)
