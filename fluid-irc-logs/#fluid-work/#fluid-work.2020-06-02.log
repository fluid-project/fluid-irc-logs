2020-06-02T14:38:55  <Justin_o> cindyli: This morning I've been thinking about the conventional commits and what we talked about the other day. I saw that you updated the contributing guide too. One issue that we talked about, is what to do if you have multiple commits but they are of different types within the same PR. If you don't squash it doesn't matter so much, but you will need to mention the issue number in each commit. Conventional commits
2020-06-02T14:38:55  <Justin_o> don't allow you to use the scope for the issue number so you'd have to have a long like "fix: some description (#XX)", "fix: (#xx) some description", or something like that. However you run into issues when you have lots of commits to address the same issues; which is often the case. That makes it harder for those reading the commit logs to parse the specific changes in a way that I believe conventional commits is
2020-06-02T14:38:55  <Justin_o> trying to use the commit logs.
2020-06-02T14:39:43  <Justin_o> cindyli: anyways, wondering more about your thoughts on this.. for me personally I'm thinking more about this from the perspective of uio-plus which has started to adopt a similar structure for commit logs and prs.
2020-06-02T14:39:57  <Justin_o> greatislander, Bosmon, and others: I'd be curious to know your thoughts on this as well.
2020-06-02T14:40:49  <Justin_o> for reference:  conventional commits ( https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ )
2020-06-02T14:41:04  <Justin_o> wecount contributing guide ( https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md )
2020-06-02T14:41:25  <Justin_o> and uio-plus repo ( https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus )
2020-06-02T14:46:56  <cindyli> Justin_o: right, using "squash and merge" only keeps the merge as the only entry in the commit history. it's impossible to find the trace of specific changes for each commit in a pull request
2020-06-02T14:48:01  <cindyli> If this is a problem, using conventional commits might be preferred over "squash and merge"
2020-06-02T14:48:48  <Justin_o> cindyli: when I say "conventional commits" I mean the standard.. not our style of merging in say a project like Infusion.
2020-06-02T14:51:09  <Justin_o> cindyli: I guess I'm trying to think through what are the trade offs, what are the benefits of using one system over another, what is best at communicating our intentions, etc.
2020-06-02T14:53:02  <cindyli> Justin_o: so what are these two systems again? using "squash and merge" vs. the infusion way to merge? I think I may misunderstand you
2020-06-02T14:53:35  <Justin_o> yes, in general.. there are probably others.. but also the commit log methods and everything around all those thigns
2020-06-02T14:53:37  <Justin_o> things
2020-06-02T14:56:28  <cindyli> Justin_o: i think the benefit of using "squash and merge" is the repo commit history is clean with every commit is a merge of a pull request, a full fix of an issue. the disadvantage is the same that we lose individual commits in each pull request. Based on how everyone uses the commit history differently, some ppl may prefer one over the other
2020-06-02T14:57:10  <cindyli> from my experience, i found I barely look at individual commit in a pull request because that code might be changed later in the same pull request
2020-06-02T14:58:13  <cindyli> so i have no objections in using "squash and merge", but other ppl may have different opinions

2020-06-02T14:59:54  <cindyli> one thing you might be interested to know is, we talked last week to include the issue if in the pull request title, in a format of <type>: <description> (resolves <issue-id>)
2020-06-02T15:00:31  <cindyli> however, when merging the pull request using "squash and merge", the part of "(resolves <issue-id>)" will be automatically removed from the merge title
2020-06-02T15:00:44  <cindyli> so I ended up manually adding this part at every merge
2020-06-02T15:01:51  <cindyli> i'm not sure if it's because of brackets around the text. I'll experiment with other formats to include the issue id

2020-06-02T15:09:13  <simonjb> Justin_o, cindyli: catching up on your discussion regarding commits and PRs. for C2LC, I'm been thinking of moving to a squash at merge approach also to simplify history
2020-06-02T15:10:01  <Justin_o> simonjb, cindyli: I also agree about the cleaner commit history.
2020-06-02T15:11:06  <Justin_o> cindyli: I wonder why that was removed from the title. was it that the character length was too long. Git actually does have a recommended max length for the first line of the commit. GitHub tends to make use of that for the UI
2020-06-02T15:11:40  <simonjb> as developers we each have different commit approaches and a branch with lots of little commits (experimental, fix what I just did, etc) it means that history and tools like git blame are harder to work with
2020-06-02T15:12:01  <gtirloni> simonjb: +1 -- plus all the commits during a PR review
2020-06-02T15:13:11  <simonjb> another approach to making a clean history is ongoing rebasing as a feature is being developing, but this makes it much harder to work together with others on the same feature
2020-06-02T15:13:16  <Justin_o> simonjb: I agree with that too.. I like to make  lots of commits myself. It makes it easier to move back and forth and across locations and etc. Also that might mean work in progress commits for larger changes.
2020-06-02T15:13:48  <simonjb> yes, on C2LC, we have a branch currently with over 70 commits
2020-06-02T15:14:11  <simonjb> and we really don't need all of those when the feature is finished an merged
2020-06-02T15:14:27  <cindyli> Justin_o: i don't think it's the length. when using "squash and merge", the github adds the pull request id in the format with brackets like "(#pull_request_id)" at the end of the merge title. I'm guessing the brackets in our own pull request title might be in conflict with this
2020-06-02T15:17:19  <Justin_o> cindyli: that could be it, I guess we need to do some experimentation about that
2020-06-02T15:17:28  <cindyli> agree
2020-06-02T15:18:56  <simonjb> cindyli: for We Count, when you squash at merge, are you listing all of the commits in the commit message?
2020-06-02T15:19:08  <cindyli> yes, simonjb
2020-06-02T15:19:43  <simonjb> cindyli: ok, and do you keep those around so they can be found later?
2020-06-02T15:20:31  <simonjb> the commits that constituted the PR
2020-06-02T15:20:39  <cindyli> yes, i figure those are extra information that ppl may look at later to know what steps or experiments have been tried
2020-06-02T15:20:59  <simonjb> cindyli: how do you ensure that they persist?
2020-06-02T15:21:38  <simonjb> for example, if I make a PR and you squash it, and I delete my branch, then they are gone
2020-06-02T15:21:46  <Justin_o> cindyli: wouldn't it be dependent on the branch owner to keep a public copy of the related branch?
2020-06-02T15:21:48  <cindyli> oh, i see
2020-06-02T15:22:27  <cindyli> those messages are just merge description, text only, they don't refer back to any branches
2020-06-02T15:23:48  <Justin_o> cindyli:  do you know if the full commit log is persisted in the squash merge, or is it just the first line description?
2020-06-02T15:24:09  <cindyli> Justin_o: it's the full commit log
2020-06-02T15:24:24  <Justin_o> that's good
2020-06-02T15:26:21  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2020-06-02T15:26:24  <gtirloni> i don't mean to derail the conversation but i have a kind of related question, are we favoring github issues over jira? i think jira needs the jira# in the PR title / commit to track changes
2020-06-02T15:26:32  <Justin_o> cindyli, simonjb: would you like to continue this discussion in zoom after the planning meeting?
2020-06-02T15:26:57  <cindyli> simonjb, Justin_o: there's an issue I noticed with keeping all commits for a pull request: if pull request B is based off the pull request A. while B keeps merging in A's updates to keep up to date, when A is merged into the master branch, B pull request still shows file changes including changes in A. Also, when B is merged into the master, the commit log at "squash merge" shows commit history from A too
2020-06-02T15:27:01  <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, good idea, that would be great
2020-06-02T15:27:19  <cindyli> sure
2020-06-02T15:27:53  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I think we're starting to use GitHub Issues more.. but not all projects use it. And I'm not sure if some would switch or not. I'm compiling  a list of our repos in the fluid-project and inclusive-design orgs to try to organize the issue tracking.. we have some cases where both GitHub Issues and JIRA are both used for the same codebase.
2020-06-02T15:27:58  <simonjb> it's something that I've been thinking about recently with regards to C2LC and it would be good to chat together about it
2020-06-02T15:28:09  <gtirloni> Justin_o: got it, thanks
2020-06-02T15:28:46  <Justin_o> cindyli: that's a good point, that's because the history gets rewritten with a squash merge.
2020-06-02T15:28:58  <Justin_o> or likely the reason, but it's another important thing to keep in mind
2020-06-02T15:30:04  <simonjb> Justin_o: it's not so much that a squash merge rewrites history as it creates an alternative and the original commits are not present in the future repo
2020-06-02T15:30:06  <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you have any thoughts on using GitHub Issues vs JIRA, do you have a preference for one over the other.. I'm happy to hear your thoughts.. I can share the Google Sheet I have compiled so far. In general my recommendation will probably be to move most of our repos to use GitHub Issues.
2020-06-02T15:30:34  <Justin_o> simonjb: yes, that's a better description thanks
2020-06-02T15:30:48  <simonjb> rebasing would be rewriting history
2020-06-02T15:32:06  <gtirloni> Justin_o: for my use cases, GitHub Issues is perfectly fine so I have no problems with moving
2020-06-02T15:33:51  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
