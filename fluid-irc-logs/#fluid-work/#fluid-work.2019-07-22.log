2019-07-22T11:31:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon2, the-t-in-rtf: Not sure if you've seen this https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6383
2019-07-22T11:31:46  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, yes, I meant to review once I finished these tests.
2019-07-22T11:31:56  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: great thanks :)
2019-07-22T11:33:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I would discuss it with @Bosmon2, I believe we've gone the other way, i.e. disabling Chrome but not headless.
2019-07-22T11:33:12  <the-t-in-rtf> let me see if I can find an example and I'll comment on the ticket
2019-07-22T11:37:08  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6383?focusedCommentId=40639&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40639
2019-07-22T11:37:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I was right, we did disable "headed" Chrome instead in previous discussions in other projects.
2019-07-22T11:39:00  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: will that affect the infusion tests for UI widgets? Some of the tests actually require focus, CSS, and etc.
2019-07-22T11:39:26  <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2019-07-22T11:42:54  <the-t-in-rtf> node node_modules/testem/testem.js ci --file tests/testem.js --launch "Headless Chrome"
2019-07-22T11:43:03  <the-t-in-rtf> that's just to use headless Chrome, and it does pass

2019-07-22T11:53:02  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, I also just ran that and it does seem to pass
2019-07-22T11:53:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I think early on there might have been issues, having trouble remembering that far back.
2019-07-22T11:54:34  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: have you tried Firefox headless https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Headless_mode
2019-07-22T11:54:45  <the-t-in-rtf> just a moment
2019-07-22T11:56:10  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't think there's a launcher for testem
2019-07-22T11:56:47  <Justin_o> ah that's too bad
2019-07-22T11:57:37  <the-t-in-rtf> actually

2019-07-22T11:57:46  <the-t-in-rtf> you can use it, you just have to get there a different way
2019-07-22T11:58:11  <the-t-in-rtf> you need to set the HEADLESS environment variable to true.
2019-07-22T11:59:31  <the-t-in-rtf> running it now

2019-07-22T12:01:51  <the-t-in-rtf> they just didn't make a convenient shortcut for that, it's all just browser command line args AFAIK
2019-07-22T12:02:37  <Justin_o> cool, well if that works and it's faster maybe we should just switch to that.. maybe we comments for how to turn it off in case we need to do debugging in  the headed version
2019-07-22T12:03:00  <Justin_o> I wonder if that would actually let me run the tests directly on my machine without it requiring focus too

2019-07-22T12:07:48  <the-t-in-rtf> well
2019-07-22T12:08:01  <the-t-in-rtf> you don't ever debug the CI config, which is the only place skip and launch have any real meaning
2019-07-22T12:08:23  <the-t-in-rtf> you'd just run "node node_modules/testem/testem.js --file tests/testem.js" and just hook whatever you want up to it
2019-07-22T12:08:33  <the-t-in-rtf> omit the "ci"
2019-07-22T12:09:09  <the-t-in-rtf> So, I'm seeing CI-only failures in  both the browser and node tests that I can't reproduce locally.
2019-07-22T12:09:19  <the-t-in-rtf> are there known issues there, @Bosmon2 (or anyone)?
2019-07-22T12:09:32  <Justin_o> okay, I was just thinking for this random test failure I'm looking into it was helpful to see where it exactly things were stalling out https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6382 although most of the debugging I've been doing directly in Chrome on my machine.
2019-07-22T12:09:59  <Justin_o> well the one I just mentioned is a known issue I'm working on, it doesn't seem to happen all the time though
2019-07-22T12:10:23  <the-t-in-rtf> Per @Bosmon2's request I worked hard to ensure that you could bypass Testem if needed for debugging, so that should be fine.
2019-07-22T12:10:25  <Justin_o> I have been able to reproduce by just running the syllabification tests in chrome on macOS, but it's quite random
2019-07-22T12:10:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I personally have to troubleshoot issues where it matters, like coverage reporting or instrumentation.
2019-07-22T12:10:48  <the-t-in-rtf> good luck tracking it down.
2019-07-22T12:11:50  <Justin_o> thanks, spent most of the last couple of working days on it, I think it's related to promises or dynamically loaded scripts or both...

2019-07-22T14:55:43  <cindyli> Bosmon2, the-t-in-rtf, i've been investigating https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4036. the cause of it is because all preferences keyed by application specific terms, such as "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.office", are not tracked in PSPChannel.model.settingControls. The reason why they are not tracked is because the GPII schema, flat.json5, only contains schemas for common terms without schemas for applicatio
2019-07-22T14:55:44  <cindyli> n specific terms, so that schemas[innerPrefsKey] at this line https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PSPChannel.js#L192 returns undefined and all application specific pref keys are filtered out of "settingControls". is there a schema for application prefs? or do I miss anything?
2019-07-22T15:02:19  <cindyli> there seems to be 2 options to fix it:
2019-07-22T15:03:07  <cindyli> 1. create schema files for application specific terms. there will have to be different files for different platforms
2019-07-22T15:03:52  <cindyli> 2. create corresponding common terms for PSP supported applications, such as MS office, and add them to flat.json5, like what we do for high contrast
2019-07-22T15:04:08  <jhernandez> cindyli: thanks for investigating this
2019-07-22T15:04:38  <jhernandez> I really like the idea of providing schema files for app specific under 1
2019-07-22T15:04:46  <cindyli> my pleasure :)
2019-07-22T15:05:15  <jhernandez> that would help us to clean a bit our endless growing win32.json file :P
2019-07-22T15:05:53  <jhernandez> and bring them into the game only when needed
2019-07-22T15:06:07  <jhernandez> but yeah, let's wait for Bosmon2's advice
2019-07-22T15:06:48  <cindyli> ya, that will help to get rid of "supportedSettings" section in win32.json
