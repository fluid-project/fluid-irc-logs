2019-03-01T15:15:55  <javjarfer[m]> Hi everyone! Sure, jhernandez , Bosmon  I'm going to update them right now
2019-03-01T15:19:47  <Bosmon> cindyli - I don't think we need three endpoints to send prefs to the server
2019-03-01T15:19:55  <Bosmon> We can reuse the existing PUT endpoint for the usecase you just made
2019-03-01T15:20:16  <cindyli> ok
2019-03-01T15:21:50  <cindyli> Bosmon: i still think using separate endpoints for creating and updating gpiiKey will be easier when we start to implement another grant type for NOVA
2019-03-01T15:22:19  <cindyli> the NOVA case would use the POST to create new key while the regular grant type can only update existing gpiiKey
2019-03-01T15:22:26  <Bosmon> cindyli - I think it will be less of a burden on us to maintain and document fewer endpoints
2019-03-01T15:22:43  <Bosmon> The whole point of the Oauth flow is that it takes care of authentication orthogonally to the HTTP verbs
2019-03-01T15:23:44  <cindyli> Bosmon: are you thinking adding a http parameter to the endpoint to distinguish these two cases?
2019-03-01T15:23:58  <Bosmon> cindyli - no, we can always look up all we need from the access token
2019-03-01T15:24:15  <cindyli> good point
2019-03-01T15:24:21  <cindyli> i will make the change
2019-03-01T15:24:26  <Bosmon> cheers!
2019-03-01T15:24:44  <Bosmon> "preferencesPostPrefsHandler" was always going to be an awkward thing to lug about : P
2019-03-01T15:24:59  <Bosmon> I mean, what ELSE would one post to a preferences server but preferences? : P
2019-03-01T15:25:51  <cindyli> we probably want a better name since this handler implies key + preferences
2019-03-01T15:26:06  <Bosmon> cindyli - but that one now just becomes the PUT handler
2019-03-01T15:26:21  <Bosmon> key + preferences -> PUT, just preferences -> POST
2019-03-01T15:26:54  <cindyli> right.

2019-03-01T15:50:15  <cindyli> Bosmon: I'm back to the original thought after reminding myself of the workflow. sorry that you have to be more persuasive. The privilege check of access tokens is by on CBFL when it receives a /settings PUT request - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3721/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/SettingsPutHandler.js#L45. based on the privilege of an access token, at line 54 or 56, CBFM calls the prefs server endpoints to upda
2019-03-01T15:50:16  <cindyli> te prefs or create key + prefs. Access tokens never reach the prefs server
2019-03-01T15:51:15  <Bosmon> cindyli - well in that case there is no job to be done here, if the prefs server has no role in protecting access
2019-03-01T15:51:55  <Bosmon> If there is no access check that the prefs server can make, there is still no need for two endpoints : P
2019-03-01T15:52:33  <cindyli> how the prefs server distinguish create or update then
2019-03-01T15:53:07  <Bosmon> cindyli - it doesn't need to
2019-03-01T15:53:19  <Bosmon> It knows perfectly well whether the safe exists or not : P
2019-03-01T15:53:41  <cindyli> but it doesn't know if the intention to create the key or not if the key doesn't exist
2019-03-01T15:54:02  <Bosmon> If it receives the request, and the safe doesn't exist, obviously the intention must be to create the key
2019-03-01T15:54:20  <Bosmon> If it can make no access check of its own, how could it possibly be that the intention is not to create the key? : P
2019-03-01T15:54:31  <cindyli> nah, we support the case that an existing key points to prefsSafeId "null"
2019-03-01T15:54:54  <cindyli> right now in the master, all requests to non-existent key will be rejected
2019-03-01T15:55:30  <cindyli> if a key points to prefsSafeId "null", the prefs server will create the prefs safe at receiving preferences
2019-03-01T15:57:51  <Bosmon> What's the reason to treat the cases differently?
2019-03-01T15:58:54  <cindyli> to support 2 oauth grant types soon: one is for creating keys and the other cannot
2019-03-01T15:59:11  <Bosmon> Yes, but the prefs server never knows anything about oauth grants, right?
2019-03-01T15:59:22  <Bosmon> It just receives whatever the CBFM instructs it
2019-03-01T15:59:31  <cindyli> that's why it needs different endpoints for CBFM to call
2019-03-01T15:59:40  <Bosmon> Shall we have a quick call? : P
2019-03-01T15:59:47  <cindyli> certainly
2019-03-01T15:59:50  <cindyli> where
2019-03-01T16:00:00  <Bosmon> Skyp?
2019-03-01T16:00:03  <cindyli> sure
