2019-08-15T13:12:08  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there cindyli ! Do you know anything about the localflowmanager endpoint for testing user preferences? Is it removed for gpii-app now?
2019-08-15T13:14:26  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: i'm not sure which end point you talked about. what was the behavior?
2019-08-15T13:15:29  <javjarfer[m]> well, we use to test using the demo users querying the local endpoint localhost:8081/user/"name"/[login|logout]
2019-08-15T13:19:18  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: it's still there. just when you start GPII with production configs, these endpoints (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L338) will be hidden, so make sure to use dev configs in order to use these endpoints
2019-08-15T13:20:11  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: okay, so when in production the only way to test users in with morphic keys true?
2019-08-15T13:20:33  <javjarfer[m]> thanks for the clarification, I was just wondering what happened
2019-08-15T13:20:46  <cindyli> :)
2019-08-15T13:23:25  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: yes, when running GPII in the production mode, usbs or windows auto logins would be the only ways I can think of. but javi or kavya might know other ways as they tests more with installers

2019-08-15T15:18:59  <gmoss> cindyli: I did, thanks! Changing the component passed in to the function to be the previewer instead of the editor did the trick for the saving issue.

2019-08-15T18:19:47  <jhung> Justin_o do you know if there's a way in the code Inspector in Chrome to highlight the element being focused in the inspector? I'm trying to debug a keyboard focus issue but having a hard time finding where focus is going.
2019-08-15T18:22:21  <Justin_o> jhung: you want to test the focus styling on a specific element?
2019-08-15T18:26:14  <jhung> Not quite Justin_o. I'm testing keyboard navigation and not all focusable elements are getting styling. Also some focusable elements are getting focused but the containers are collapsed / not visually rendered.
2019-08-15T18:26:57  <jhung> However, there's no easy way for me to see which elements in the DOM is getting focus.
2019-08-15T18:27:40  <Justin_o> I usually just use JavaScript to help with this. and just console log the element that has focus

2019-08-15T19:05:48  <michelled> gmoss: ok, how's SJRK-263 going?
2019-08-15T19:07:13  <gmoss> michelled: haven't had much chance to work on it today, until just now :) but as I mentioned this morning, I'm currently looking into why the storySpeaker is still reading the unfiltered content
2019-08-15T19:08:10  <gmoss> it seems to involve model relay interaction, since that's how the text that's sent to the textToSpeech component is created
2019-08-15T19:08:21  <michelled> I wonder if Justin_o would have some insight based on his text to speech UIO work
2019-08-15T19:08:41  <gmoss> good call! hopefully :)
2019-08-15T19:09:45  <michelled> Justin_o: are you around?
2019-08-15T19:10:11  <Justin_o> michelled: yes, I'm here
2019-08-15T19:11:57  <gmoss> Justin_o: would you be able to help me sift through my model relays to determine why my empty block filter is seemingly being ignored? I suspect it might have to do with which relays are resolved when. I wasn't able to solve this using priority entries
2019-08-15T19:12:24  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure I can try
2019-08-15T19:12:38  <gmoss> Justin_o: much appreciated :) thanks michelled for enabling this haha
2019-08-15T19:13:16  <michelled> ha! anytime :)
2019-08-15T19:13:35  <Justin_o> gmoss: can you point me at the code, and did you want to talk through it?
2019-08-15T19:15:37  <gmoss> sure, just getting some links together for you. Here's the latest branch: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/tree/stories-floe-dev
2019-08-15T19:15:37  <gmoss> here are the model relays that set up the textToSpeech input (ttsText is what is fed into the call to queueSpeech):  https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/src/ui/base-page-storyEdit.js#L81-L103
2019-08-15T19:15:37  <gmoss> and here is the model relay that constructs a story's contentString: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/src/ui/story.js#L51-L58
2019-08-15T19:16:38  <gmoss> I set up some model listeners to write out to the console when changes are made, and the order of those looks correct, but i realize that model listeners and model relays will be dealt with at different times
2019-08-15T19:25:27  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm trying to get a running instance up
2019-08-15T19:25:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, hopefully my instructions are sufficient
2019-08-15T19:25:53  <gmoss> please let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to document it better
2019-08-15T19:26:26  <Justin_o> I was reading through the code you sent, and am looking at the README now for how to setup.. will need to get Docker installed though, so will take a bit of time I guess
2019-08-15T19:27:46  <gmoss> Justin_o: you can run it without docker, only Node is really necessary
2019-08-15T19:27:50  <gmoss> you just won't be able to save
2019-08-15T19:28:04  <Justin_o> ah okay.. that makes it easier
2019-08-15T19:28:09  <gmoss> the symptoms can be seen on the story preview before submission to the server, by hitting the text-to-speech button
2019-08-15T19:29:06  <gmoss> i have a console.log call attached to {storySpeaker}.events.onSpeechQueued
2019-08-15T19:29:30  <gmoss> also a model listener on ttsText
2019-08-15T19:34:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: if you're all set up, the Jira has some repro steps: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-263
2019-08-15T19:35:18  <Justin_o> ran into a permissions issue with NPM but I think I have that sorted now
2019-08-15T19:35:24  <Justin_o> installing is happening now
2019-08-15T19:36:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay :) hopefully it's all smooth from here on out
2019-08-15T19:44:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: servers up and running.. will try those reproduction steps
2019-08-15T19:45:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: cool! I'm currently re-re-reading the relay structure to see if i missed anything
2019-08-15T19:45:37  <gmoss> your fresh eyes are helpful though
2019-08-15T19:46:28  <Justin_o> gmoss: how do you actually publish the story?
2019-08-15T19:46:36  <gmoss> within the tool?
2019-08-15T19:46:40  <Justin_o> I see, I have to go through preview first
2019-08-15T19:46:45  <gmoss> ah yeah
2019-08-15T19:47:05  <gmoss> publishing won't work though and you'll see a db connection error in your node log
2019-08-15T19:47:13  <gmoss> but you don't need to publish to see the error
2019-08-15T19:47:27  <gmoss> the Jira was written when we thought the error was only on publish
2019-08-15T19:47:31  <Justin_o> okay, where should I see the error
2019-08-15T19:47:43  <gmoss> so on the preview you'll see the "speaker" icon
2019-08-15T19:47:57  <gmoss> just click that, and if it reads things from the should-be-empty block, that's the error
2019-08-15T19:48:31  <gmoss> like if you have an image block with no image uploaded, but you filled in the heading, it won't be rendered but you'll hear it spoken by the tts
2019-08-15T19:48:33  <Justin_o> gmoss: so it shouldn't read anything?
2019-08-15T19:48:51  <gmoss> Justin_o: correct, it should not read empty blocks
2019-08-15T19:48:54  <gmoss> empty is based on type
2019-08-15T19:49:20  <gmoss> for text blocks, any field is sufficient for it not to be empty. for the other three it needs to have the media supplies as well
2019-08-15T19:49:30  <gmoss> (what's an image block without an image? a video block without a video?
2019-08-15T19:49:33  <gmoss> )
2019-08-15T19:50:02  <Justin_o> okay, so I actually need to put a description or something of the image
2019-08-15T19:50:16  <Justin_o> and it shouldn't read that description if there was no image added
2019-08-15T19:50:38  <gmoss> correct
2019-08-15T19:51:05  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, also I notice that it is reading "By" even when there is no author specified and the "by" text isn't rendered
2019-08-15T19:51:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: you may want to default that to "Anonymous" or something like that
2019-08-15T19:51:32  <gmoss> Justin_o: yeah that's another issue, a bit more complicated
2019-08-15T19:51:37  <Justin_o> or not have it read "by"
2019-08-15T19:51:51  <Justin_o> okay
2019-08-15T19:52:02  <gmoss> my preference would be to not have it read "by", but iirc it has to do with limitations within fluid.stringTemplate
2019-08-15T19:52:06  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm not seeing any console logs, did you say you committed some
2019-08-15T19:52:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: I've only added them here, there's no remote branch
2019-08-15T19:52:31  <gmoss> just my local branch
2019-08-15T19:52:34  <Justin_o> okay
2019-08-15T19:54:09  <gmoss> i can make a remote branch if need be
2019-08-15T19:57:23  <gmoss>  Justin_o: I've made a remote branch with one commit so far incorporating Cindy's fix
2019-08-15T19:57:50  <Justin_o> gmoss: what is Cindy's fix for?
2019-08-15T19:57:50  <gmoss> https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/tree/SJRK-263
2019-08-15T19:58:06  <gmoss> Justin_o: her fix keeps the bug from occurring on save
2019-08-15T19:58:25  <gmoss> it's a 9-char fix haha
2019-08-15T19:58:43  <Justin_o> ha thanks, so it just pulls from the preview instead of the editor?
2019-08-15T19:58:44  <gmoss> i described it earlier in here this morning if you're curious
2019-08-15T19:58:52  <gmoss> right
2019-08-15T19:59:48  <gmoss> when i'd originally written that handler, there was no block filter so it didn't matter which it was pulling from. now the previewer should only have filtered content

2019-08-15T20:13:01  <gmoss> Justin_o: yes sorry I forgot to tag you in my reply
2019-08-15T20:13:50  <Justin_o> gmoss: I think this may be the problem https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/themes/base/messages/storyMessages_en.json#L3
2019-08-15T20:14:43  <gmoss> Justin_o: %contentString is the issue, yes. since it's based on what's in the "content" model endpoint, I expect that if "content" is empty that "contentString" is also empty
2019-08-15T20:14:45  <gmoss> but that isn't the case
2019-08-15T20:15:08  <Justin_o> gmoss: well https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/src/ui/base-page-storyEdit.js#L225-L236
2019-08-15T20:15:10  <gmoss> Justin_o: I can't wrap my head around how contentString can be non-empty if it's based on the storyPreviewer story's content
2019-08-15T20:16:09  <Justin_o> it looks like you are emptying content, but contentString isn't being modified. and you are using the whole model as the token object and it is using contentString for replacement.. is there another model relay that transforms content to contentString?
2019-08-15T20:16:12  <gmoss> hmm... I suppose if this transform function is only replacing content, and then the relay that calls that function is literally replacing the story model with the one from the editor, that would do it
2019-08-15T20:16:31  <gmoss> Justin_o: there is a relay in the story grade that sets contentString based on content
2019-08-15T20:17:00  <gmoss> but if this copies the editor model straight over then it might not trigger that relay for the previewer story
2019-08-15T20:17:57  <gmoss> so it's as if it circumvents that relay for the previewer, using the resolved value of contentString from the editor instead
2019-08-15T20:18:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, I think you have it.. You shouldn't ever make changes to the model directly. It will not trigger any of the change applier api and model relays.
2019-08-15T20:19:15  <Justin_o> the model relay that moves content to contentString should be removing the empty blocks to begin with
2019-08-15T20:19:17  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@205.211.168.101> has joined #fluid-work
2019-08-15T20:19:28  <Justin_o> from what I'm understanding
2019-08-15T20:19:36  <gmoss> Justin_o: indeed, that's not an ideal solution. when i created this filter, it was the one I was able to figure out that allowed me to iterate over the content array as well as my hash of minimum-sufficient fields for a block
2019-08-15T20:19:53  <Justin_o> or whatever is populating content shouldn't allow the empty blocks.. if you don't want them ever
2019-08-15T20:19:55  <gmoss> Justin_o: content should not contain empty blocks though
2019-08-15T20:20:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: but we may want an empty block in the editor. if we're not done editing for instance
2019-08-15T20:20:30  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, so you'd want an initial model relay to guard against content having empty blocks
2019-08-15T20:20:36  <gmoss> if i start writing my story, have a half-empty image block, want to see the preview, go back and edit more, etc
2019-08-15T20:20:38  <Justin_o> gmoss: oh okay
2019-08-15T20:20:42  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@205.211.168.103> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-08-15T20:21:38  <Justin_o> gmoss: if preview and editor have different models, which is sounds like they do from Cindy's change.. then during the transfer between the two you can strip empty blocks
2019-08-15T20:22:20  <gmoss> Justin_o: that was the intent of this relay transform. I guess I just need to add some logic to handle contentString as well..
2019-08-15T20:22:36  <gmoss> is there any way to manually trigger a change on "content" so that the relay will fire after?
2019-08-15T20:23:19  <Justin_o> you can all that.applier.change("modelPath", value)
2019-08-15T20:23:30  <Justin_o> but I don't think you'd want to do that in the transform
2019-08-15T20:23:45  <Justin_o> it would be strange for the transform to be modifying the source model values
2019-08-15T20:24:06  <gmoss> Justin_o: right, the transform is just supposed to return to the target
2019-08-15T20:24:11  <Justin_o> gmoss: yep
2019-08-15T20:25:09  <Justin_o> gmoss: It might be helpful to try to sketch out the model sharing, relays, transformations amongst the various components. Could help with tracking down what needs what and how best to share things.
2019-08-15T20:26:11  <gmoss> Justin_o: mhmm, not a bad idea. what I'd really love would be a way to have a relay stripping empty blocks that only affect's the story's content key, so I don't have to return the entire model
2019-08-15T20:26:18  <gmoss> I'll start sketching it out though
2019-08-15T20:26:32  <gmoss> *affects
2019-08-15T20:26:36  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm thinking you probably want a relay like (editor model.content -> preview model.content with empty blocks removed) but I'm not sure I have everything straight in my head.
2019-08-15T20:26:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's exactly what I want, but the issue is how to achieve it from a technical standpoint
2019-08-15T20:27:36  <gmoss> Justin_o: content is an array of block grades. the hash that defines what an empty block is is another array. they both need to be iterated over in order to get everything
2019-08-15T20:27:57  <gmoss> for every block, depending on its type, if it contains at least one of the keys defined then it is not empty

2019-08-15T20:28:31  <gmoss> Justin_o: {storyEdit}.options.blockContentValues is that hash
2019-08-15T20:28:57  <Justin_o> gmoss: does only the preview have a contentString?
2019-08-15T20:29:04  <Justin_o> not the editor?
2019-08-15T20:29:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: editor and previewer each have a story component, each story component has a model, and each story model has a content array and a contentString
2019-08-15T20:29:41  <gmoss> so both
2019-08-15T20:30:01  <Justin_o> gmoss: but the editor doesn't use the content string?
2019-08-15T20:30:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: i suppose not
2019-08-15T20:30:16  <Justin_o> it just has it because the story grade comes with it?
2019-08-15T20:30:20  <gmoss> Justin_o: yes
2019-08-15T20:30:35  <gmoss> Justin_o: i'm trying to think of a case for the editor needing contentString
2019-08-15T20:30:56  <gmoss> Justin_o: it's only used for the storySpeaker, I believe.
2019-08-15T20:31:29  <Justin_o> okay so a couple more options 1) the transformation from content to contentString ignores the empty blocks 2) another internal model path is created that is a transformation of content to "sanitized content" that is then passed to what becomes contentString

2019-08-15T20:32:39  <gmoss> Justin_o: so both the editor and previewer would have this "sanitized" story?
2019-08-15T20:33:03  <gmoss> I think option 1 might be tidier
2019-08-15T20:33:08  <gmoss> I'll give that a shot
2019-08-15T20:33:53  <Justin_o> cool, hope it works
2019-08-15T20:34:19  <Justin_o> I'm heading offline now, but I'll be back in the early morning if you want to chat some more, or you can send me an e-mail and I'll look at it when I get back online.
2019-08-15T20:34:22  <Justin_o> gmoss: ^
2019-08-15T20:34:35  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, thanks for your help!
2019-08-15T20:34:48  <gmoss> it seems like we've found the issue, just need to find an appropriate solution now
