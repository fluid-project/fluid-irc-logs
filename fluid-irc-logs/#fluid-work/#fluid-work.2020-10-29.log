2020-10-29T13:42:27  <Justin_o> greatislander, greatislander[m] : I just noticed there appears to be some left over code possibly from the conversion of the switch to a button https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/main/src/components/switch/js/Switch.js#L95-L98
2020-10-29T13:42:48  <Justin_o> Would you like to look at cleaning that up. You can also remove the related invoker.
2020-10-29T13:46:08  <greatislander[m]> Sure, Justin_o

2020-10-29T18:32:37  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. I think I did that for one of the chrome extensions I was working on, but not sure if it will work for infusion.
2020-10-29T18:32:42  <Teddy___> michelled: philip surprise drop ins reminds me of special celebrity guest in sitcoms
2020-10-29T18:33:16  <michelled> yeah, we'd expect a joke too :D

2020-10-29T18:36:49  <Teddy___> michelled: i'll make sure I got the laugh track ready... and crickets if it bombs aha
2020-10-29T18:38:21  <michelled> haha
