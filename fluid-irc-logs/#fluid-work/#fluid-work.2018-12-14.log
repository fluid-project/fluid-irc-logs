2018-12-14T13:19:46  <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey boz
2018-12-14T13:20:29  <jhernandez> FYI, I've just reported this funny ticket https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3593
2018-12-14T13:22:28  <jhernandez> I'm sure that users won't experience the problem at AJCs since there's an already user session running
2018-12-14T13:24:08  <jhernandez> but I think that this might be a problem after we introduce the "auto-login" thing
2018-12-14T13:26:33  <jhernandez> stegru: ^ - since you were taking a look at the implementation of the auto-login feature
2018-12-14T13:28:43  <stegru> ok
2018-12-14T13:28:44  <jhernandez> and yeah, probably the windows service prevents us from experiencing this problem in the future when it is implemented - but i thought it was worth reporting and having it in our radar
2018-12-14T13:29:04  <stegru> the service wouldn't prevent it
2018-12-14T13:29:29  <jhernandez> yeah

2018-12-14T13:30:35  <stegru> ok well, I'm glad you've seen this - I was going to perform the auto-login very early
2018-12-14T13:30:56  <jhernandez> ok
2018-12-14T13:32:28  <jhernandez> in any case, maybe Bosmon or Cindyli have some thoughts about this - probably we can handle it
2018-12-14T13:35:10  <jhernandez> btw, yesterday I produced another installer and I think that this time is really worth to share it with people for early testing
2018-12-14T13:37:21  <jhernandez> Bosmon: are you ok if I publish npm releases of my GPII-3577 branches of both windows and gpii-app ?

2018-12-14T14:12:01  <cindyli> the other pull request is ready for another look too - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/719
2018-12-14T14:14:07  <cindyli> I'm thinking the next work to work on. one is https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3396 if you can attach a log file with the failure to the JIRA since I never successfully reproduced this failure
2018-12-14T14:16:02  <cindyli> the other is to remove context manager or ontology from the code base. but we should have discussion whether they should be removed completed. if not, which parts should be kept

2018-12-14T15:38:21  <Bosmon> Hi there gmoss, and waharnum when he gets in
2018-12-14T15:38:30  <Bosmon> I am just rewriting the resource loader and came across https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6305
2018-12-14T15:38:48  <Bosmon> I see the bug that was fixed, but I see that some historical behaviour which now seems dubious ended up being retained
2018-12-14T15:39:07  <Bosmon> The bit that says "// If options.defaultLocale is set, it will replace any
2018-12-14T15:39:16  <Bosmon> defaultLocale set on an individual resourceSpec
2018-12-14T15:39:40  <Bosmon> I can't think of a great reason for this, given usually options on a more specific thing replace those placed on a less specific thing
2018-12-14T15:39:49  <Bosmon> Would you be ok with this behaviour being swapped round?

2018-12-14T16:20:40  <cindyli> hi Bosmon, i pinged you this morning about what to work on next. can you have a look if you didn't see it. I started to work on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3117. let me know you if you have more urgent things for me to work on.
2018-12-14T16:20:59  <Bosmon> cindyli - sure
2018-12-14T16:21:14  <Bosmon> I'm being held up a bit at present since something is preventing me running unit tests successfully on my machine
2018-12-14T16:21:19  <Bosmon> But I'll take a look
2018-12-14T16:21:48  <Bosmon> cindyli - I thought the next bit of work was going to be removing the dynamic session component in the LifecycleManager?
2018-12-14T16:23:55  <cindyli> right. there's that piece. ok. switching to that
2018-12-14T16:26:06  <Justin_o> jhung: would you be able to follow up on this GitHub issue https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/issues/20
2018-12-14T16:30:00  <jhung> Thanks Justin_o. I'll take a look.
2018-12-14T16:32:18  <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2018-12-14T16:36:47  <bryan_> Bosmon: I updated the PR and ci passed. Should I squash those commits? https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/228
2018-12-14T16:39:14  <jhernandez> bryan_: hey! FYI, we don't squash very often
2018-12-14T16:39:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon, gmoss: It feels to me like specifying a default locale like en_CA is non-standard. I would have expected to do en-CA. What do you think?
2018-12-14T16:41:43  <bryan_> Thanks...just making sure!

2018-12-14T17:30:34  <Bosmon> I'm starting to think that there might be some kind of fairly significant memory leak in the current trunk of universal
2018-12-14T17:31:05  <Bosmon> Does anyone else have any suspicion of this?
2018-12-14T17:31:14  *** michelled <michelled!~Adium@192-0-151-7.cpe.teksavvy.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2018-12-14T17:31:28  <Bosmon> In running the test cases now my node process is at 2G, and the run gets slower and slower, eventually running into random failures
2018-12-14T17:34:57  <jhernandez> hmm, interesting
2018-12-14T17:35:11  <jhernandez> Bosmon: what kind of random failures? anything in particular?

2018-12-14T17:46:47  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, eventually there is some random failure like a socket reset, or the thing just hangs
2018-12-14T17:46:57  <Bosmon> I think it's pretty evidently caused by the memory exhaustion
2018-12-14T17:47:50  <jhernandez> Bosmon: did you see it happening in CI, or just locally?
2018-12-14T17:47:57  <Bosmon> jhernandez - just locally
2018-12-14T17:47:59  <jhernandez> ok
2018-12-14T17:48:14  <jhernandez> in our linux box?
2018-12-14T17:48:24  <Bosmon> My guess is that CI is somewhat better at dealing with the memory image than Windows is
2018-12-14T17:48:38  <Bosmon> No, the exhaustion is in my bare-metal Windows machine
2018-12-14T17:48:41  <jhernandez> ok
2018-12-14T17:48:58  <Bosmon> I think this node isn't prepared to run a process of larger than 2G, and the Linux one is probably fine with it
2018-12-14T17:49:00  <Bosmon> But who knows
2018-12-14T17:49:19  <Bosmon> gpii-pouchdb might be implicated after all since its failed cleanup is another important difference between Windows and Linux machines
2018-12-14T17:49:22  <Bosmon> I'll carry on testing
2018-12-14T17:50:18  <jhernandez> Bosmon: okay, I'll be around. let me know if you want me to double check on anything
2018-12-14T17:50:22  <Bosmon> Cheers, jhernandez
2018-12-14T17:50:37  <jhernandez> meanwhile I'll clone universal and run the tests in my windows vm
2018-12-14T17:50:39  <Bosmon> bryan_ - your pull is looking good, I'm testing it out now
2018-12-14T17:51:06  <Bosmon> I was thinking that another useful thing to turn to might be trying to cook up with stegru some kind of approach for getting any kind of test coverage for his "App Zoom" function
2018-12-14T17:51:34  <Bosmon> I imagine it will be impossible to exercise all of the code since it requires a real target window, but it's unclear how much of the system could be mocked out
2018-12-14T17:52:03  <Bosmon> But basically most of the code in here is uncovered: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-app-zoom/src/appZoom.js
2018-12-14T17:52:37  <stegru> I was waiting for the coverage police to catch up with me on that
2018-12-14T17:53:18  <jhernandez> stegru: busted!
2018-12-14T17:53:44  <Bosmon> hahaha
2018-12-14T17:56:10  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm not aware of a standard on these resource bundle names
2018-12-14T17:56:21  <Bosmon> Our current convention was taken from this Java standard: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html#getBundle%28java.lang.String,%20java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.ClassLoader%29
2018-12-14T17:57:09  <Bosmon> Justin_o, is gmoss/waharnum around today?
2018-12-14T17:58:05  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the data blocks chat was just a topic in our general call with sgithens and the-t-in-rtf, but we can easily bring it up as an agenda item on Wednesday

2018-12-14T18:01:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess I meant more about passing in the locale through the options more than the bundle name itself.
2018-12-14T18:02:26  <Bosmon> OK, well we can certainly revisit that

2018-12-14T18:15:05  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I tried a run without instrumentation and whilst there was some leak, it wasn't enough to bomb the process - it only got to about 1.5G
2018-12-14T18:15:26  <the-t-in-rtf> interesting
2018-12-14T18:15:28  <Bosmon> I'm currently wondering whether this is a leak we've actually had all the time, and it's just the increase in size of the solutions registry in your pull that pushed everything over the egde
2018-12-14T18:15:30  <the-t-in-rtf> "only"
2018-12-14T18:15:54  <Bosmon> There are probably multiple factors that conspire to magnify the size of the original leak
2018-12-14T18:15:57  <the-t-in-rtf> how would the instrumentation affect the registry?
2018-12-14T18:16:02  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, it's JSON data.

2018-12-14T18:23:03  <stegru> how do we even generate these coverage reports? i'm getting a 0% report
2018-12-14T18:23:13  <Bosmon> stegru - "npm test" does it
2018-12-14T18:23:26  <stegru> it doesn't for me
2018-12-14T18:23:52  <Bosmon> The coverage police don't recognise that excuse :)

2018-12-14T18:27:35  <bryan_> Bosmon: that's the discussion we had yesterday with stegru where we would have to mock a wmi class method to get and set a dummy setting. Otherwise that block will never run in a VM. Can I create a sub task for that?
2018-12-14T18:28:00  <Bosmon> bryan_ - sure
2018-12-14T18:28:09  <Bosmon> What do you think about that approach?
2018-12-14T18:28:22  <Bosmon> stegru - do you think that using that other WMI method you found wouldn't work?
2018-12-14T18:28:46  <stegru> what other method?
2018-12-14T18:28:52  <Bosmon> That is, with the random WMI method as the "get" arm of the settings handler?
2018-12-14T18:30:19  <stegru> I'm not sure what you're talking about
2018-12-14T18:31:07  <jhernandez> xDDD
2018-12-14T18:31:15  <jhernandez> "the coverage police"
2018-12-14T18:33:25  <bryan_> stegru: the "get buildnumber from os" query to suggested
2018-12-14T18:33:41  <stegru> oh.. yes, maybe
2018-12-14T18:33:49  <Bosmon> Yes, that one
2018-12-14T18:34:14  <stegru> there's one way to find out ;)
2018-12-14T18:34:16  <bryan_> I'll create the subtask and try it there
2018-12-14T18:34:44  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - unfortunately this 2nd run (without instrumentation) is up to 2G again so it may just have been a random variation
2018-12-14T18:36:13  <stegru> the coverage runner doesn't work in c:\vagrant - but everyone who listens to tony knows that already
2018-12-14T18:39:57  <jhernandez> stegru: yeh, v for victory
2018-12-14T18:42:34  <stegru> the bulk of red lines in appzoom.jz can be extracted into their own functions, and tested in isolation
2018-12-14T18:44:44  <bryan_> Bosmon:  I created GPII-3595 as a subtask of GPI-3554...should it be a blocker of the parent task?
2018-12-14T18:44:57  <jhernandez> stegru: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/74 - tests bailing out again without a reason ?
2018-12-14T18:45:58  <stegru> yes, that's one of the corrupt memory bugs
2018-12-14T18:46:36  <jhernandez> maybe they weren't just related to the memory bugs you seemed to fix in the windows side, right?
2018-12-14T18:47:18  <stegru> yeh
2018-12-14T18:47:19  <jhernandez> and we have problems coming from somewhere else, as Bosmon was indicating earlier
2018-12-14T18:47:28  <stegru> all fixes are merged into master
2018-12-14T18:47:33  <jhernandez> yup
2018-12-14T18:47:44  <jhernandez> and that branch includes master

2018-12-14T18:49:51  <stegru> oh well, good luck with that one, jhernandez
2018-12-14T18:49:55  <stegru> let me know how you get on
2018-12-14T18:50:00  <jhernandez> yup
2018-12-14T18:50:09  <jhernandez> xDDD
2018-12-14T18:50:15  <stegru> my just-eat is imminent
2018-12-14T18:52:43  <jhernandez> so, I'm also seeing in an installer I've just built that our electron process starts eating cpu and memory like crazy
2018-12-14T18:52:54  <jhernandez> dunno, maybe doomsday is here and I wasn't aware of it :P
2018-12-14T18:53:13  <jhernandez> stegru: enjoy your tea!
2018-12-14T18:54:21  <jhernandez> didn't experience that in the previous one (that was using older versions of both universal and windows)
2018-12-14T18:54:47  <stegru> it passes locally
2018-12-14T18:55:18  <jhernandez> stegru: yup, it's passing here as well
2018-12-14T18:59:09  <jhernandez> interesting, it doesn't behave the same when I run it from source code
2018-12-14T19:01:28  <jhernandez> ok, it's a matter of time - it starts eating resources in the same way, but it takes some more time until is noticeable
2018-12-14T19:02:23  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, what were the results of downgrading?
2018-12-14T19:02:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, have you tried running only some of the tests?
2018-12-14T19:03:06  <the-t-in-rtf> it may be an overall volume thing, but if it's something specific, the rule of halves might help narrow it down
2018-12-14T19:03:24  <the-t-in-rtf> it's only a hair above clutching at straws, but at least it's an actual system for narrowing things down
2018-12-14T19:13:31  <jhernandez> gotta run now, will continue looking at it later - I'll test with the previous version of universal and see if it rings any bell

2018-12-14T19:32:39  <sgithens> I'm making these screens of the capture tool... running in Electron/gpii-app.  I'm curious what our current thoughts are for CSS frameworks.  I think the psp is using winstrap (bootstrap derivative to look like windows), we've expressed our fondess for Foundation in other projects,  I've also been shown this by the folks at Maryland: https://designsystem.digital.gov/

2018-12-14T19:34:01  <alanharnum> a heads-up for everyone who may be doing work over the weekend, especially those on European time - I just heard that there's emergency power company maintenance over the weekend that will shut down the OCAD datacentre
2018-12-14T19:34:11  <alanharnum> details sent out to the everyone, fluid-work and GPII architecture lists
2018-12-14T19:34:47  <alanharnum> Right now it looks like the window is 9PM EST Saturday to 9AM EST Sunday, but central IT just heard about this themselves, so that may change
2018-12-14T19:40:08  <sgithens> thanks alanharnum

2018-12-14T21:28:00  <gmoss> Hi Bosmon, sorry for my lack of reply, I've been under the weather today. Both of the changes you've proposed seem reasonable to me. The way the default locale has to be specified at current is due, iirc, to the way fluid.explodeLocalisedName handles splitting the locale codes. Using dashes is what I would expect.

2018-12-14T23:13:35  <Bosmon> As far as I can see, the memory leak doesn't seem to be a feature introduced in some particularly recent version of a dependency
2018-12-14T23:13:57  <Bosmon> As it turns out, with current trunk, I can *just about* squeak through a run of the universal tests, with the process image pegging close to 2G
2018-12-14T23:14:24  <Bosmon> But testing out the-t-in-rtf 's "MAGIC" onboarding branch, I think merely the fact that it includes one extra acceptance test tips the system over the edge
2018-12-14T23:14:45  <Bosmon> Especially since there are a bunch of tests which are a little bit timing sensitive in the middle of the run
2018-12-14T23:15:05  <Bosmon> I think if you can get to the preference server tests before the heap exhaustion kicks in you will be home and dry since those ones are pretty robust
2018-12-14T23:16:02  <Bosmon> It can take 30 seconds to a minute for the thing to do enough GC to start up a fresh server close to the end, but it does make it heroically
