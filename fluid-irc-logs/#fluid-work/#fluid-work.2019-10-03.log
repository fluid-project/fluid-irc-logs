2019-10-03T15:00:58  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding the new "pullModel" API, do you think it makes sense to require the incoming pref term must match the term defined in the solution registry? using the windows magnifier -> magnification setting as an example, the read request must request:
2019-10-03T15:01:04  <cindyli> "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/common/magnification": {
2019-10-03T15:01:04  <cindyli>     value: 3
2019-10-03T15:01:04  <cindyli> }
2019-10-03T15:01:28  <cindyli> to match with the corresponding inputPath defined in win32.json5: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L7329
2019-10-03T15:01:51  <cindyli> the core won't support the application terms such as requests like:
2019-10-03T15:02:06  <cindyli> "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/applications/com\\.microsoft\\.windows\\.magnifier.Magnification": {
2019-10-03T15:02:06  <cindyli>     value: true
2019-10-03T15:02:06  <cindyli> }
2019-10-03T15:02:08  <cindyli> or
2019-10-03T15:02:23  <cindyli> "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/applications/com\\.microsoft\\.windows\\.magnifier.http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/common/magnification": {
2019-10-03T15:02:23  <cindyli>    value: 3
2019-10-03T15:02:23  <cindyli> }
2019-10-03T15:03:46  <cindyli> this requirement will help to filter out other settings that have "noMatch" defined in "capabilitiesTransformations" and will always be returned by read() function
2019-10-03T15:04:41  <cindyli> let me know what you think. thanks
2019-10-03T15:05:45  <Bosmon> cindyli no, the incoming pref term needs to match what the tool itself uses in its ontology
2019-10-03T15:05:54  <Bosmon> Given it already has a fixed ontology corresponding to its buttons
2019-10-03T15:06:28  <cindyli> is there an ontology file defined for each tool?
2019-10-03T15:06:40  <cindyli> in gpii-app?
2019-10-03T15:08:19  <cindyli> it needs to be somewhere in the universal

2019-10-03T15:10:49  <cindyli> Bosmon: i think what you meant is this file - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/testData/qss/settings.json
2019-10-03T15:14:36  <cindyli> right now, pref terms defined in this file happen to match "inputPath" in win32.json5
2019-10-03T15:15:33  <cindyli> actually, i think the core should be able to support all 3 use cases by using different logic to filter application terms and common terms, like what transformer is doing. giving a try...
2019-10-03T15:16:39  <cindyli> let me know if there's another file for the ontology mapping between gpii-app and universal
2019-10-03T15:18:42  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, the ontology they use is in settings.json
2019-10-03T15:18:52  <Bosmon> But in practice we will not know what it is until they announce it in a pullModel request
2019-10-03T15:19:20  <cindyli> exactly. better to support all use cases
2019-10-03T15:20:34  <Bosmon> cindyli - well, it's really just one use case - we interpret any intelligible path that they supply in a pullModel request : P
2019-10-03T15:23:48  <cindyli> well. that's true, just the core has to be intelligent enough to deal with different form of intelligible paths

2019-10-03T18:45:00  <sgithens> cindyli - my other left over thought from our thread yesterday, is that for the sake of capturing, you may want to present both options. Like you might want to still have the application specific settings as options you can save under those solutions, but then do all inverse transforms and make those savable after capture under a generic preferences collapse.  In the event of capture too... you might have multiple
2019-10-03T18:45:00  <sgithens> things installed that produce different values for the same generic preferences... so we'd have to pick which one to save
