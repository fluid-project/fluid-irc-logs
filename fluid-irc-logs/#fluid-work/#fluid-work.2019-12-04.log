2019-12-04T13:10:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  hello, I've tried a few things to work around my issue with FLUID-6420 but not having any success
2019-12-04T13:11:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I've checked in the method you suggested, if you're curious to see
2019-12-04T13:12:04  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - sorry not to have got the chance to look at your problem yet, I got pretty sick during my trip to Paris
2019-12-04T13:12:12  <Bosmon> I'll just have some breakfast and it's next on my list : P
2019-12-04T13:12:13  <Justin_o> I also went back and re-wrote everything with a single merge policy, but that also doesn't work. In general the same issue occurs. The context aware supplied preference is ignored. I think the reason for them being ignored may be different though.
2019-12-04T13:12:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: :( I hope you're feeling better
2019-12-04T13:12:46  <Bosmon> I imagine what has happened that somehow something is attempting to evaluate that preference earlier in the dataflow than the contextAwareness grade is applied
2019-12-04T13:12:54  <Justin_o> also I find it amazing that I've managed to have breakfast before you. Or maybe we call different things breakfast
2019-12-04T13:12:56  <Bosmon> I can't really think what could be doing that, but it's all I can think of
2019-12-04T13:13:16  <Bosmon> Well I've had to spend the whole morning in bed : P
2019-12-04T13:13:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think that's correct, and I think it's the expander that is used.
2019-12-04T13:13:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh no well don't get out of bed on my account

2019-12-04T13:28:29  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well there's no reason the expander should be evaluated any sooner than anything else
2019-12-04T13:28:54  <Bosmon> Hopefully nothing in the contextAwareness calculation actually tries to demand the value of prefsPrioritise itself
2019-12-04T13:32:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure about the internals, but the grade that is supplied does not, it only sets the options it needs to supply
2019-12-04T13:39:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: in case you're having trouble tracking it down, this is the context aware supplied grade https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6420/demos/prefsFramework/js/prefsEditorDemo.js#L87-L98

2019-12-04T13:59:56  <Bosmon> What is on the stack that has demanded the value?
2019-12-04T14:01:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: when the merge policy is called?
2019-12-04T14:01:43  <Bosmon> Well, what is it that has demanded prefsMerged?
2019-12-04T14:03:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: now I'm a bit confused, are you asking what triggered the expander on prefsMerged or the merge policy from context aware supplied preference
2019-12-04T14:03:51  <Bosmon> Well, you said "the expander on the prefsMerged option is getting hit before the context aware supplied preferences is merged"
2019-12-04T14:04:02  <Bosmon> So something must have demanded the value of prefsMerged
2019-12-04T14:04:15  <Justin_o> ah okay

2019-12-04T14:05:50  <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to see the name of the invoker that is being called?
2019-12-04T14:06:14  <Bosmon> Well, if you see "makeInvoker" on the stack you can just look around in its scope
2019-12-04T14:07:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I am seeing a call to computeDynamicGrades so I'd guess it's either https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6420/src/framework/preferences/js/AuxBuilder.js#L432-L440 or https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6420/src/framework/preferences/js/PrimaryBuilder.js#L66-L76
2019-12-04T14:08:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'd better just take a look
2019-12-04T14:08:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2019-12-04T14:08:47  <Bosmon> Could you remind me what your branch name is again since it has scrolled by a bit?
2019-12-04T14:09:05  <Justin_o> I think I've used pretty much every means of getting a grade added
2019-12-04T14:09:15  <Justin_o> FLUID-6420
2019-12-04T14:09:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-12-04T14:09:49  <Bosmon> cheers
2019-12-04T14:10:32  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm looking in invokerInvoker on the stack and it looks like it's from the buildPrimary invoker that I mentioned above
2019-12-04T14:10:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, that's just what we expect
2019-12-04T14:10:55  <Bosmon> The question is why prefsPrioritised gets evaluated out of order
2019-12-04T14:11:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon: should the context aware grade be retrieved and merged before grades specified with an invoker?
2019-12-04T14:11:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so the easiest way to see this is in the prefs framework demo?
2019-12-04T14:12:05  <Bosmon> I have opened this up and I get a failure "The primary schema for fluid.prefs.tableOfContents is not defined"
2019-12-04T14:13:15  <Bosmon> Ah no, that is gone now
2019-12-04T14:13:28  <Bosmon> Must have been a dirty cache
2019-12-04T14:13:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - do I have to run this FIrefox?
2019-12-04T14:13:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that's the right demo.. you can use any modern browser I believe
2019-12-04T14:13:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think it's just IE11 that won't work
2019-12-04T14:13:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in practice the contextAware grade is also implemented with an invoker
2019-12-04T14:14:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah I guess that makes sense actually
2019-12-04T14:14:18  <Bosmon> But it hopefully shouldn't matter which gets applied first
2019-12-04T14:14:30  <Bosmon> As long as both get applied before anyone tries to evaluate prefsPrioritized
2019-12-04T14:14:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - but isn't the point of this demo to dynamically contribute a TTS panel, which presumably only works on FIrefox?
2019-12-04T14:15:14  <Bosmon> So what I see is an empty panel at the right hand side
2019-12-04T14:15:19  <Bosmon> Is this what I should be seeing?
2019-12-04T14:15:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes it contributes the TTS panel, but it should work in all modern browsers. It works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox. and if I remember correctly MS Edge
2019-12-04T14:16:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I've forgotten what the Chrome TTS bug is, it's related to the pause functionality which is why our tests don't run?
2019-12-04T14:16:43  <Justin_o> that empty panel is showing you that the context aware check passed and supplied the grade which included the TTS specific template for the prefs editor, but the supplied preference wasn't included so the panel for text-to-speech hasn't been initialized
2019-12-04T14:17:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep, the Chrome bug is for pause

2019-12-04T14:22:48  <Bosmon> Justin_o - what a huge pile of stuff there now is on fluid.uiOptions : P
2019-12-04T14:23:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep, it has quite a few things pushed onto it so that I can handle all of the schema resolution itself
2019-12-04T14:23:52  <Justin_o> Bosmon: let me know what you think of this idea
2019-12-04T14:24:00  <Bosmon> Justin_o - once we get this working we may want to think about factoring this a bit better
2019-12-04T14:25:50  <Bosmon> OK, so I am now in "fluid.prefs.builder.prioritizePrefs" which I can verify is being called early
2019-12-04T14:26:39  <Bosmon> So it seems the reason that this is being invoked is because fluid.prefs.primaryBuilder.buildPrimary is attempting to consume {that}.options.prefsMerged
2019-12-04T14:27:35  <Bosmon> But I imagine you knew this : P
2019-12-04T14:28:35  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. I was hoping it would be consuming it after the all the other parts had been merged.
2019-12-04T14:28:55  <Justin_o> the auxiliary builder grade also has a similar invoker for finding all the auxiliary schemas
2019-12-04T14:30:34  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I believe the scheme is for the supplied grades to be chewed through in order from left to right
2019-12-04T14:31:39  <Bosmon> My first suspicion is that our issue is because the contextAwareness grade is thrown into the system from the outside
2019-12-04T14:31:56  <Bosmon> And hence the expander {that}.check ends up last in the queue
2019-12-04T14:33:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that seems to be a likely scenario.. but not sure a way around that.. particularly in the current framework that requires fluid.viewComponent be placed in a particular location
2019-12-04T14:33:46  <Justin_o> although I guess this could still fall victim to that
2019-12-04T14:34:04  <Bosmon> I've only spent a few moments thinking about this, but what comes to mind is two things: i) the first comment on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5948 suggests that we always wanted to give users the power to insert grades anywhere into the stack, and ii) that whether the framework's order of evaluation of dynamic grades perhaps isn't correct
2019-12-04T14:34:41  <Bosmon> It may well be that we would want dynamic grades to be expanded from right to left, even if we can't do anything about the other problem for a while
2019-12-04T14:35:03  <Bosmon> Anyway, I'll devote the rest of breakfast to thinking about this : P
2019-12-04T14:35:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2019-12-04T14:35:25  <Bosmon> I think it's clear that in a proper open authorial system, gradeNames will have to be more than just a crummy array
2019-12-04T14:35:29  <Bosmon> This has been a worry for a long time
2019-12-04T14:35:43  <Bosmon> But gradeNames was the part of Infusion that was implemented very first
2019-12-04T14:36:07  <Bosmon> Ideally gradeNames should be a set of namespaced elements with "before:" and "after:" priorities just like everything else that's open

2019-12-04T14:37:04  <Bosmon> It may be that our cheapest way out of this problem would be a horrific hack that always just shoves ContextAwareness to the head of any queue that it is in, since if anyone wants it at all, it's clear that they're always going to want it first
2019-12-04T14:37:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the other approach I tried yesterday was to use a single merge policy on preferences. It replaced if an array was supplied and converted to an object. If an object was supplied it merged. and would remove if one of the preferences was assigned a value of null.. the problem I had there is that the context aware grade was merged ahead of the options supplied during instantiation so we'd always lose it if an
2019-12-04T14:37:33  <Justin_o> array was passed in during instantiation... I think in that approach the best solution would be to always require an object for preferences, and we'd avoid all of this, but the user would have more work.
2019-12-04T14:38:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: will putting the ContextAwareness at the front affect fluid.viewComponent usage?

2019-12-04T14:40:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also an issue with priorities for my use case is that we really want to say we want a specific order that is [a, b, c, d] if I set  c to before:d and b to before:d I don't want [a, c, b, d] although that would be valid. So inserting a preference into the middle of the set is a bit difficult to ensure precision.

2019-12-04T15:30:44  <Bosmon> It's just that I already did a bit of work in this area with my fix for expanders as dynamic grades
2019-12-04T15:32:14  <Bosmon> For https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6414
2019-12-04T15:32:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think that should be fine

2019-12-04T15:32:25  <Justin_o> UIO+ is already on the new framework anyways
2019-12-04T15:32:36  <Bosmon> I'm thinking that with the FLUID-6414 changes there might actually be a little room for a kind of half-assed priority system already within the grades
2019-12-04T15:33:09  <Bosmon> Since the new framework is already geared up to accept a grade entry which is an Object rather than simply a String

2019-12-04T16:13:53  <javjarfer[m]> I can't find where they are defined
2019-12-04T16:14:29  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - on which component? : P
2019-12-04T16:15:18  <javjarfer[m]> oh, for "gpii.tests.windows.builtIn"

2019-12-04T16:18:03  <Justin_o> I guess we'd need to know what the open source license includes for space and etc.
2019-12-04T16:18:30  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon ^
2019-12-04T16:18:49  <Justin_o> alanharnum: probably not a simple as just copying our data over unfortunately.
2019-12-04T16:22:56  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that's not even a component : P
2019-12-04T16:23:06  <Bosmon> Could you be a little clearer what you are talking about? : P
2019-12-04T16:25:26  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I just wanted to look to the implementation of where the payloads from the tests definitions are passed to the settings handlers for the acceptance tests
2019-12-04T16:25:41  <javjarfer[m]> but I can't find where that is located
2019-12-04T16:28:16  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, the system just goes through a login, right?
2019-12-04T16:28:33  <Bosmon> Could you say exactly what activity of the acceptance tests you are interested in?
2019-12-04T16:28:44  *** christop_ <christop_!~textual@24.54.251.55> has joined #fluid-work
2019-12-04T16:29:54  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I think it's not exactly the same as a normal login, because I have had a problem with the acceptance tests run in with the new systemSettingsHandler (for certain settings only) that I didn't have doing a login-logout operation
2019-12-04T16:30:18  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - perhaps because of the population of mocks?
2019-12-04T16:30:27  <Bosmon> I think you know a great deal about this area having contributed to it yourself : P
2019-12-04T16:31:37  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I don't even remember the exact place of my contributions to this right now xD, but it could be related...
2019-12-04T16:31:47  <Justin_o> Teddy: not sure if anyone mentioned to you yet, but you should probably add a watch to the keyword "fluid-everyone". We use that to notify the channel about meetings and etc.
2019-12-04T16:32:43  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the sequence of steps comprising the login is defined here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Fixtures.js#L259 - but this may not be most useful to you
2019-12-04T16:32:44  <javjarfer[m]> basically, the get operation needs certain input, for certain settings, passed to the settingsHandler, but I think no input is being given to it for this operations
2019-12-04T16:33:14  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, the acceptance tests are intended to be highly realistic
2019-12-04T16:33:28  <Bosmon> And so if this input is not available in the tests, there is a high chance that it is not available either in the real system : P
2019-12-04T16:33:34  <Bosmon> Can you say what this input is?
2019-12-04T16:34:14  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: but a login / logout cycle works perfectly with a test user

2019-12-04T16:34:49  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - black magic : P

2019-12-04T17:49:03  <Justin_o> okay.. I'm just enjoying the conversation at the moment
2019-12-04T17:50:44  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I think I have sorted out the previous problem, but it kinds worries me getting lost following the trace of the tests execution, would you recommend me how I should put myself up to date with all the infrastructure  for them? which are the grades involved and how they relate? or the only place for this is "Fixtures.js"?
2019-12-04T17:51:06  <javjarfer[m]> also, take care of your throat!
2019-12-04T17:52:25  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - sure, the sequences executed are in there, and then there are the mocks you are familiar with in Mocks.js
2019-12-04T17:52:44  <Bosmon> Anything else you feel you might need to know about?
2019-12-04T17:53:19  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I haven't been able to see how this grade related to the other one in the tests definition file
2019-12-04T17:53:38  <javjarfer[m]> (the sequence of grades that connects them I mean)
2019-12-04T17:54:36  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, the main engine grade for one of these acceptance/integration type fixtures is this one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Fixtures.js#L61
2019-12-04T17:58:00  <Bosmon> Then there are a bunch of little driver functions that select amongst the various sequences to be applied like this one written by the-t-in-rtf - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/RunTestDefs.js#L98
2019-12-04T17:58:12  <Bosmon> We should at some point try to make this structure a bit more declarative
2019-12-04T17:59:06  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay! I think I get it
2019-12-04T17:59:40  <javjarfer[m]> so this is why you said this is a really "realistic test" because it really hooks into a real login operation
2019-12-04T18:13:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: when do you expect the fix for https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6438 to be ready. Just trying to decide what to pick up in the mean time
2019-12-04T18:13:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I should have it done tomorrow
2019-12-04T18:14:17  <Bosmon> Ideally, before you are up : P
2019-12-04T18:14:40  <Justin_o> wow that fast
2019-12-04T18:14:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, I'll look into something small then.
2019-12-04T18:15:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, not sure if you saw my e-mail but I tested UIO+ with the latest Infusion dev release and it was working
