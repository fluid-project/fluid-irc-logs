2019-02-25T10:37:24  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @jhernandez, @stegru, et cetera.  Just seeing where we got with the Windows VM and CouchDB tests.
2019-02-25T10:37:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I had a plan to work on the issues Cindy reported with "local development" configurations, but can certainly help out there depending.
2019-02-25T10:41:06  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: hey
2019-02-25T10:42:00  <jhernandez> at this point there is a failure and it's not related to provisioning couchdb or the like
2019-02-25T10:42:20  <the-t-in-rtf> no happy there's a failure, but happy that the couchdb stuff works
2019-02-25T10:43:11  <the-t-in-rtf> a change of that magnitude is like an earthquake, you expect a few aftershocks, hopefully once I address Cindy's concerns we can just move forward
2019-02-25T10:43:44  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, if you find that it's still a side effect of what I've done and need help puzzling it out, I'm here
2019-02-25T10:43:54  <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise I'll focus on the problems Cindy reported with the local configs
2019-02-25T10:44:52  <jhernandez> it looks like a failure related to other changes that landed master recently
2019-02-25T10:45:38  <jhernandez> but can't tell at this point
2019-02-25T10:45:57  <the-t-in-rtf> so, universal master?
2019-02-25T10:46:09  <the-t-in-rtf> or windows?
2019-02-25T10:46:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm assuming the former.
2019-02-25T10:48:38  <the-t-in-rtf> just idly thinking about how we might use CI to guard against changes in universal that cause problems downstream.
2019-02-25T10:50:21  <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess we use dev releases of universal now, so that should have been a clear problem in the next windows pull that tried to use a newer version.
2019-02-25T10:50:41  <jhernandez> not sure yet, Bosmon pointed out that it might be caused by recent changes in universal
2019-02-25T10:56:37  <jhernandez> today I'll be mostly away - have to go to the airport and won't be at home until 6pm
2019-02-25T11:33:06  <Danail_Dido> jhernandez, write me in Skype when you are home this evening! ;-)

2019-02-25T14:19:06  <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/745
2019-02-25T14:19:17  <the-t-in-rtf> The fix was simple and I've confirmed all configs working.
2019-02-25T14:19:24  <the-t-in-rtf> just waiting for the tests to run in CI.
2019-02-25T14:22:10  <cindyli> cool. thanks, the-t-in-rtf. testing..
2019-02-25T14:23:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I just naively tested a db-backed endpoint in each one, that's exactly what I was hoping you could quickly do.
2019-02-25T14:23:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean test it properly
2019-02-25T14:23:27  <the-t-in-rtf> as you'd know better what should work for each config.

2019-02-25T14:28:50  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: testing the first config file and noticed one issue - if you start GPII with this command:

2019-02-25T14:30:39  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: actually the master also gives this report. not sure what it is
2019-02-25T14:31:16  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't get that error running the same command
2019-02-25T14:31:26  <cindyli> umm.
2019-02-25T14:31:56  <the-t-in-rtf> Do I have to try to login first?
2019-02-25T14:32:11  <the-t-in-rtf> or should it start logging that from the time it starts up?
2019-02-25T14:32:45  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: the latter. no login is required
2019-02-25T14:32:52  <the-t-in-rtf> that's really odd.
2019-02-25T14:32:54  <cindyli> is the reset url - http://localhost:8060/reset-couch
2019-02-25T14:33:34  <cindyli> the express server on 8060 is not started
2019-02-25T14:33:40  <the-t-in-rtf> yes,
2019-02-25T14:33:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I see that
2019-02-25T14:34:07  <the-t-in-rtf> probably a good time to follow through on our discussion about getting rid of that in favour of a documented hard developer reset
2019-02-25T14:34:25  <cindyli> ya, i'm fine with either
2019-02-25T14:34:44  <the-t-in-rtf> if you stop gpii and remove the docker container, the effect should be the same
2019-02-25T14:34:49  <the-t-in-rtf> and then start up again
2019-02-25T14:35:03  <cindyli> great. trying it.
2019-02-25T14:36:37  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: so, if I start GPII and do some manually testing, then run a couch backed test, would the manual change to the couchdb be wiped out by the test run?
2019-02-25T14:36:55  <the-t-in-rtf> absolutely
2019-02-25T14:37:05  <the-t-in-rtf> the tests cannot leave the db the way it is.
2019-02-25T14:38:13  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, a clean install does not have the problem you mention, and I merged with master earlier today
2019-02-25T14:38:15  <cindyli> would using different couchdb port helps? or does couch always writes to the same set of data files regardless of the port?
2019-02-25T14:38:22  <the-t-in-rtf> well
2019-02-25T14:38:29  <the-t-in-rtf> you'd have to set up a separate VM for that
2019-02-25T14:38:42  <the-t-in-rtf> which means making something that detects which VM it "owns"
2019-02-25T14:38:55  <cindyli> in order to write into a complete different couch?
2019-02-25T14:41:22  <cindyli> also, you mentioned "a clean install does not have the problem you mention", what do you mean by "a clean install"?
2019-02-25T14:41:37  <Bosmon> Hi there Danail_Dido - let me know if you've got the JIRA permissions you need now
2019-02-25T14:41:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if I remove my docker container and rerun one of the configs
2019-02-25T14:42:10  <Danail_Dido> Thanks Bosmon, I've got the new permissions already :-)
2019-02-25T14:42:14  <cindyli> i see. thanks
2019-02-25T14:42:21  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - awesome
2019-02-25T14:42:22  <the-t-in-rtf> all of them will create the docker container and provision the DB if it doesn't already exist.
2019-02-25T14:43:29  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: seems we could replace /reset-couch with this instruction of restarting the docker container
2019-02-25T14:43:40  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that was my plan.
2019-02-25T14:44:31  <cindyli> also state that running tests and manually started GPII share the same couchdb
2019-02-25T14:45:59  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's fair

2019-02-25T17:47:05  <javjarfer[m]> so, weird thing Bosmon is that, the settings looks like are called, even when they shouldn't because that pull was for removing the necessity of extra calls. but this particular setting look like it's being called anyway
2019-02-25T17:47:44  <javjarfer[m]> as jhernandez points out, may be related to more complex transform rules for this setting https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6058
2019-02-25T17:48:08  <javjarfer[m]> I can dig in about it latter, and see what the settingsHandler is receiving
2019-02-25T17:49:56  <jhernandez> well, it shouldn't hit that point since os_win7 uses the app-specific setting
2019-02-25T17:50:54  <jhernandez> but, the "configure" block that sets the highContrast theme is indeed been called, right?

2019-02-25T18:07:48  <Bosmon> jhernandez, javjarfer[m] - thanks, that is pretty interesting
2019-02-25T18:07:54  <Bosmon> I had been partway through debugging this
2019-02-25T18:08:22  <Bosmon> I guess I had a wrong idea about what had been causing the problem :)
2019-02-25T18:09:32  <Bosmon> I imagine what has happened is that cindyli 's pull was stripping out all the action of the "settings.configure-registry" block perhaps because it didn't match the solution's setting - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6184
2019-02-25T18:09:47  <Bosmon> I'm glad it is a real error and not something caused by config slippage introduced by the-t-in-rtf 's pull
2019-02-25T18:10:28  <jhernandez> me too
2019-02-25T18:10:30  <Bosmon> I had already just filed https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3753 with cindyli so I guess there is a bit of work in this area
2019-02-25T18:11:56  <jhernandez> oh ... that
2019-02-25T18:11:58  <Bosmon> But I'll continue to debug a bit later - I'd got as far as noticing that the arguments to setHighContrastTheme are wrong
2019-02-25T18:12:14  <Bosmon> The 3rd argument should contain the "saveAs" value of a writable theme
2019-02-25T18:12:17  <Bosmon> But for some reason it doesn't
2019-02-25T18:12:21  <jhernandez> oh ... that looks a bit "broken" - yup
2019-02-25T18:12:46  <Bosmon> In current windows trunk, the 3rd arg is, on my system, C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Themes\\Morphic.theme
2019-02-25T18:12:56  <Bosmon> Which is the one that got put there earlier by settings.configure-registry
2019-02-25T18:13:18  <Bosmon> But in the your in-progress branch of windows this arg is wrong and refers to the built-in theme

2019-02-25T20:52:44  <cindyli> Bosmon: is GPII-3753 originated from this failure -https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/245#issuecomment-466459275?
2019-02-25T20:53:04  <cindyli> i've successfully reproduced it with the windows VM
2019-02-25T20:54:09  <Bosmon> cindyli - no, GPII-3753 was in trunk before we merged CouchDB
2019-02-25T20:54:26  <Bosmon> I think it has been there for quite a long time, perhaps months
2019-02-25T20:54:32  <cindyli> oh, noooo...
2019-02-25T20:54:35  <Bosmon> It's a MatchMaker bug
2019-02-25T20:55:07  <cindyli> ok, how did you produce the payload you wrote in the jira?
2019-02-25T20:55:22  <Bosmon> cindyli - I produced it by running Acceptance test on current windows trunk
2019-02-25T20:55:30  <Bosmon> Which is bound to the version of universal we had before CouchDB
2019-02-25T20:55:47  <Bosmon> But this bug is less important
2019-02-25T20:56:12  <Bosmon> We need to track down the bug which stops https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/245#issuecomment-466459275? being merged
2019-02-25T20:56:21  <Bosmon> Which as javjarfer[m] has found, was caused by GPII-3653
2019-02-25T20:56:38  <Bosmon> This one is urgent because we can't build any installers until we can run the acceptance tests again
2019-02-25T20:58:09  <cindyli> Bosmon: i thought GPII-3753 was caused by the fix for GPII-3653
2019-02-25T21:02:45  <Bosmon> cindyli - it's possible but we have no evidence for that
2019-02-25T21:03:02  <Bosmon> I just noticed GPII-3753 spontaneously when I was trying to fix the bug in the acceptance tests
2019-02-25T21:03:11  <Bosmon> It's possible that GPII-3753 is much older
2019-02-25T21:03:34  <cindyli> ok, will debug the failure of https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/245#issuecomment-466459275
2019-02-25T21:03:44  <Bosmon> In any case, GPII-3753 isn't so important, all it does is slow the system down and make it harder to debug stuff : P
