2019-01-24T20:35:34  <sgithens> bryan_:  When you were having all your troubles getting the gpii-app to build and start up with vagrant, which portion was it untimately failing on?  I've just moved to a new laptop... and am of course away from my old one, and when building my branch of gpii-app, it's consistently failing on the `ref` bindings.
2019-01-24T20:36:04  <sgithens> I'm trying to just update some of the package.json stuff, so from a clean checkout of the branch you, or anyone else could actually start up the capture tool
2019-01-24T20:36:11  <sgithens> and then work on portions of it
2019-01-24T20:36:37  <sgithens> with the branches of gpii-handlebars, universal, and windows I hacked for it
2019-01-24T20:38:35  <sgithens> huh
2019-01-24T20:38:56  <sgithens> well, I just manually reran `npm install ref` and it's starting up now
2019-01-24T20:39:00  <sgithens> :|
2019-01-24T20:39:42  <bryan_> The vm would start just fine using vagrant up but the app or tests would fail on random packages either not installed or configured
2019-01-24T20:40:32  <bryan_> I had to blow away node_modules, delete the vm and do vagrant up again
2019-01-24T20:41:10  <bryan_> I think it was not finishing npm install as part of the vagrant setup process

2019-01-24T20:46:19  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: is there a clean way to delete files from a kettle app's local filesystem using kettle middleware or some other recommended method? otherwise I'm thinking of Node's FileSystem API directly in a function, but this feels not so infusiony
2019-01-24T20:46:38  <gmoss> looking for some prior art or documentation, hopefully :)
2019-01-24T20:50:43  <stegru> sgithens, I hope you're trying it from "v:" drive, rather than "c:/vagrant"
2019-01-24T20:53:09  <sgithens> stegru: I didn't realize it made a difference... I remember seing the V drive conversation vaguegly...
2019-01-24T20:54:07  <sgithens> it did eventually work after manually reruning a few npm commands in c:\vagrant
2019-01-24T20:54:42  <stegru> ah ok
2019-01-24T20:54:54  <sgithens> I think I've always used c:\vagrant, but did notice the v: drive show up on this most recent reinstall of everything
2019-01-24T20:55:06  <sgithens> I should always use the v: drive then?
2019-01-24T20:55:27  <stegru> well, we've noticed v: works better
2019-01-24T20:55:36  <sgithens> great :)
2019-01-24T20:56:11  <stegru> c:\vagrant is a symlink to \\vboxsvr\..., and somethings resolve it, and it causes a few things to not work very well
2019-01-24T20:57:05  <sgithens> ah I see
2019-01-24T20:57:21  <sgithens> yes, symlinks tend to break a lot of our stuff
2019-01-24T20:57:58  <sgithens> thanks for the heads up stegru!

2019-01-24T23:19:34  <jhernandez> sgithens: v: for victory ;)
2019-01-24T23:22:42  <jhernandez> sgithens: bryan_ also, when some of our deps change, specially when changing from an npm ref one to a git ref one (i.e.: using an intermediate branch of windows that uses another personal branch of universal), sometimes ends up in funny situations with npm
2019-01-24T23:23:14  <jhernandez> for this, I also recommend to remove your package-lock.json in addition to the node_modules folder prior any npm install
