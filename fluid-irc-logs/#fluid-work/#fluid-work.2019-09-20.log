2019-09-20T11:02:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: hello, are you ready to meet?
2019-09-20T11:02:59  <the-t-in-rtf> yup, where?
2019-09-20T11:03:32  <Justin_o> skype or vidyo, any preference. also looks like we may have lost Bosmon
2019-09-20T11:05:35  <the-t-in-rtf> He's around, we were just chatting.
2019-09-20T11:06:10  <Justin_o> I guess we can start when he gets back
2019-09-20T11:10:24  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2019-09-20T11:10:28  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf
2019-09-20T11:10:58  <Bosmon> Skype?
2019-09-20T11:10:59  <the-t-in-rtf> great, @Bosmon, I guess you'd prefer Skype?
2019-09-20T11:11:04  <the-t-in-rtf> beat me to it...
2019-09-20T11:11:08  <Bosmon> Would you prefer something else?
2019-09-20T11:11:10  <the-t-in-rtf> I have it open already, fire away.
2019-09-20T11:11:10  <the-t-in-rtf> no
2019-09-20T11:11:17  <the-t-in-rtf> Vidyo is slightly nicer for sharing, but it's fine

2019-09-20T13:26:07  <Bosmon> Oh yes, Justin_o - I meant to ask, it sounded like you had got a version of UIO+ which is ok with the latest FLUID-6148 release of Infusion?
2019-09-20T13:26:25  <Bosmon> Did you have to do anything other than passing in {that}.locate to your DOM locator functions?
2019-09-20T13:27:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the branch commits https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/commits/FLUID-6148
2019-09-20T13:27:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's the most recent commit https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/commit/40073a14ed44fbcd12a481f7b844b41f70d2d3c1
2019-09-20T13:28:05  <Justin_o> so there were some other things, but I think it was just that the framework changes exposed a pre-existing bug
2019-09-20T13:28:26  <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool - could you make up a pull request with that?
2019-09-20T13:28:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think I mentioned this in the channel, but can't remember. It might have been at a standup.
2019-09-20T13:28:32  <Bosmon> Or is it already merged into your pull in progress?
2019-09-20T13:29:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: It is not.. but I could make a PR against gpii-chrome-extension with it
2019-09-20T13:30:20  <Justin_o> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/37
2019-09-20T13:30:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-09-20T13:33:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: the bug I had with ToC is that, well it's really that the content could find multiple elements. For example a CNN page has many articles and no main element. The content selector returns all of these article tags which we render a ToC container into, and this ToC container is handed off to the ToC component to render into. So I believe it was silently failing because of the multiple containers. This was
2019-09-20T13:33:08  <Justin_o> probably always the case though, but the timing of the creation of subcomponents actually caused the issue to be more prevalent because with the FLUID-6148 the ToC wouldn't get removed because the direct subcomponent of the enactor was not bound to the parent.
2019-09-20T13:33:15  <Justin_o> that was a complicated explanation
2019-09-20T13:33:22  <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh yes, I remember this now
2019-09-20T13:33:45  <Justin_o> it was a small change to fix my bug and things are working.. although the ToC doesn't always look pretty.
2019-09-20T13:33:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - does it look different to the way it used to?
2019-09-20T13:34:13  <Bosmon> Also - I guess there is nothing here, other than your Gruntfile changes, that are incompatible with the current framework?
2019-09-20T13:34:43  <Justin_o> I don't think so, it's probably more of a styling issue. I think some sites are knocking out the list bullets on it.. probably something I need to look into more, but we are always going to have issues like that with UIO+
2019-09-20T13:34:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - do you think you could make a tweak to your build scripts so that they don't bomb out on a missing file?
2019-09-20T13:35:09  <Bosmon> Then we can just centralise on a version of UIO+ that is compatible with both frameworks

2019-09-20T15:49:38  <colinclark> danielcho: If you’re interested, I’d be happy to take a look at your clapping-recognition code from a performance perspective
2019-09-20T15:50:24  <colinclark> One possibility might be to refactor it as an AudioWorklet, which will improve performance at least somewhat—assuming the FFT bins are accessible in this way, which I’d have to check the Web Audio spec to double check

2019-09-20T15:51:27  <danielcho> colinclark: oh yeah, it's using old version of AudioWorklet, which I will need to change it later
2019-09-20T15:52:06  <colinclark> old version? Meaning a ScriptProcessorNode, or something else?
2019-09-20T15:52:08  <danielcho> called createScriptProcessor, which is deprecated
2019-09-20T15:52:16  <danielcho> yeah
2019-09-20T15:52:18  <colinclark> right
2019-09-20T15:52:24  <colinclark> Those run in the browser’s main thread
2019-09-20T15:52:37  <colinclark> so you’ll have some latency built in depending on how you’ve configured your ScriptProcessor
2019-09-20T15:52:46  <colinclark> plus the costs of copying data between threads
2019-09-20T15:52:56  <danielcho> right
2019-09-20T15:53:07  <colinclark> not typically a huge issue, but you’ll find issues will start to crop up when you also have complex graphics going on in the DOM at the same time
2019-09-20T15:53:07  <danielcho> I will create a git repo for the prototype soon
2019-09-20T15:53:34  <danielcho> oh that can be an issue later for sure
2019-09-20T16:09:15  <danielcho> colinclark: https://github.com/chosww/soundAnalyzer here's the git, result will be displayed on Console, and if result is not displaying due to "The AudioContext was not allowed to start" warning, you can bypass the warning by comment/uncomment context.resume() for now
