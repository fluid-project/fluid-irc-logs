2020-10-19T07:32:40  <batey96> Hi, please what is the status for "Refactor/automate infusion documentation"?Does the organisation still look forward for this work to be done or the interest on it is dropped?. thought of starting to work for it as of now
2020-10-19T07:45:25  *** Rishab_ is now known as Rishab
2020-10-19T12:51:21  <Uttara> cindyli: I have a co-design meeting at 10.30 today. I might be running a bit late for the tech meeting. Or is there any chance we can swap the Thursday's tech meeting with todays Design meeting? Let me know
2020-10-19T12:55:11  <cindyli> thanks for letting me know, Uttara. as I rmb, Vera has classes on Thursday and cannot make to that meeting. Do you have Vera's skype ID? if you have, could you check with her about her availability on Thursday 11AM? thanks
2020-10-19T12:57:05  <Uttara> cindyli: yes will ask her
2020-10-19T12:57:16  <cindyli> btw, Uttara, what time will you be able to join today's meeting? maybe we can do technical discussions first. when you join we switch to design topics
2020-10-19T13:10:07  <Uttara> cindyli: Vera can make it but David cannot. But she said its fine and we can move the design talks to Thursday.
2020-10-19T13:10:34  <cindyli> great. thanks, Uttara. i will send an email about this switch
2020-10-19T13:10:47  <Uttara> okay, cindyli: I will let Lisa know too
2020-10-19T13:10:59  <cindyli> thanks, Uttara
2020-10-19T14:45:41  <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: do either of you have any experience using sessions with kettle?
2020-10-19T14:45:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2020-10-19T14:46:14  <clown> rings a bell, Justin_o
2020-10-19T14:46:26  * clown searches memory
2020-10-19T14:46:51  <cindyli> i don't think i have, Justin_o
2020-10-19T14:48:48  <clown> I think I have seen code that uses sessions but only relied on that to be doing the correct thing
2020-10-19T14:49:03  <clown> I don't think I have ever written code involving sessions
2020-10-19T14:49:10  <clown> wrt to kettle
2020-10-19T14:50:18  <Justin_o> clown: do you know where I might find an example. I only see stuff in the tests but it's a bit different setup. In particular I don't seem to be getting the cookie returned to my request.
2020-10-19T14:51:31  <clown> Justin_o:  yes, somewhere in gpii.  let me check
2020-10-19T14:53:47  <clown> Justin_o:  most recently, it had to do with the PSPChannel and BrowserChannel work:
2020-10-19T14:53:47  <clown> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/BrowserChannel.js#L27
2020-10-19T14:54:39  <clown> there is a grade there called a "gpii.flowManager.sessionAware"
2020-10-19T14:55:03  <Justin_o> greatislander: is this something we should be skipping in CLA we skip the Dependabot for example.https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty/pull/38#issuecomment-712217843
2020-10-19T14:55:32  <Justin_o> greatislander: if we're not expecting to get more commits from it, we can hold off till we do
2020-10-19T14:55:48  <greatislander> Justin_o probably, assuming we move from Netlify to Azure Static sites which I think is the plan (cc: gtirloni)
2020-10-19T14:57:07  <clown> Justin_o:  details of the session aware grade are here:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/SessionAware.js
2020-10-19T14:57:07  <Justin_o> clown: thanks.. I think that one is using web socket connections.. not sure if the workflow is different between than and http requests.
2020-10-19T14:57:39  <clown> good point Justin_o
2020-10-19T14:59:35  <clown> still … that "session aware grade"  uses the session machinery in the lifecycle manager, and I think that's neutral with respect to web sockets vs http
2020-10-19T14:59:38  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks.. I guess we'll see what gtirloni says. it shouldn't be difficult to add if needed.
2020-10-19T15:00:06  <Justin_o> clown: okay, I can poke around there thanks. Is the lifecycle manager also in universal or a different repo?
2020-10-19T15:01:25  <clown> Justin_o:  this might be a good starting point: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L40
2020-10-19T15:02:02  <Justin_o> clown: thanks, I'll take a look at that
2020-10-19T15:02:12  <clown> Justin_o:  hope it helps.
2020-10-19T15:02:59  <Justin_o> clown: I hope so too :) but it looks like it might also help with some other things I might need to do later.. so useful at any rate
2020-10-19T15:03:14  <clown> yay!
2020-10-19T15:03:55  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, there are sessions tests
2020-10-19T15:04:22  <Bosmon> It's nothing to do with flowManager.sessionAware which operates peculiar kinds of flow-managed specific tests
2020-10-19T15:04:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm trying to setup sessions for the Storytelling tool in preparation for the user accounts.
2020-10-19T15:05:09  <Justin_o> I've added the "kettle.server.sessionAware" grade to the "kettle.server" component
2020-10-19T15:05:41  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2020-10-19T15:05:42  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/tests/shared/SessionTestDefs.js#L72
2020-10-19T15:05:43  <Justin_o> currently I have a sample end point to play with and added the following grades to my request handler "kettle.request.http", "kettle.request.sessionAware"
2020-10-19T15:06:20  <Justin_o> when I use cURL to GET the end point, it returns what I've fired in the request. However, I don't get the "kettle.sid" returned
2020-10-19T15:06:26  <Justin_o> well no cookie at all from what I can tell
2020-10-19T15:06:36  <Bosmon> Justin_o - did you set up a "cookieJar"?
2020-10-19T15:06:39  <Justin_o> even when specifying a file for cURL to save the cookie to
2020-10-19T15:07:17  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have not.. I'm going to take a quick look to see if there is one already there..
2020-10-19T15:07:27  <Justin_o> so a cookieJar is another required grade?
2020-10-19T15:07:48  <Justin_o> searching for cookieJar didn't return anything in storytelling
2020-10-19T15:08:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I only see cookieJar in relation to tests in kettle. Is it also needed for the server itself? I was assuming that kettleSession middleware would handle the cookie itself through express-session
2020-10-19T15:09:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think you're right
2020-10-19T15:11:21  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so adding kettle.server.sessionAware to the server, and kettle.request.sessionAware to the request seems to be all that's required
2020-10-19T15:12:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I also assume that the defaults supplied by those grades is sufficient... although I'll want to update the secret at some point.. but I take it that things should still work right now.
2020-10-19T15:13:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  right now my handler is very basic it just does this.
2020-10-19T15:13:32  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/zs3DtHyK/
2020-10-19T15:13:57  <Justin_o> When I make the cURL request this is the output in the terminal.
2020-10-19T15:14:12  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/vIpT2mZW/
2020-10-19T15:17:01  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so here is the handler which, in this case, takes the session token from the URL and then sticks it in the session - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/tests/shared/SessionTestDefs.js#L102
2020-10-19T15:17:40  <Bosmon> Justin_o - so, do you do anything to actually touch the session?
2020-10-19T15:17:57  <Bosmon> As I recall about the way these things work, unless you actually store any session state, the libraries often don't bother to allocate a session
2020-10-19T15:19:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah no.. okay, let me try to add something to the session object
2020-10-19T15:21:22  <gtirloni> Justin_o greatislander: We haven't heard from MSFT yet so it's hard to say when we/if can migrate. It doesn't hurt to play with the app service within the free tier limits but I'd say things up a bit up in the air for now
2020-10-19T15:21:58  <greatislander> thanks gtirloni
2020-10-19T15:22:14  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for the update.. I won't make any changes to cla-assistant for now
2020-10-19T15:28:39  <gmoss> Justin_o: the Storytelling Tool does have a page-level cookieStore component set up, in case that's the same as the cookieJar that Bosmon is talking about
2020-10-19T15:29:22  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks... I need something on the server side in this case though.
2020-10-19T15:29:27  <gmoss> gotcha
2020-10-19T15:30:08  <gmoss> Justin_o: is the DB not appropraite?
2020-10-19T15:30:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: will need that too :) the request needs to send the session id to the client so that it can send it back in subsequent requests and we can follow it around
2020-10-19T15:32:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, adding something to the session did the trick. thanks for the help.
2020-10-19T15:48:12  <greatislander> hi gtirloni, I have an ILDH website question for you— let me know when you are up for a chat this afternoon

2020-10-19T21:25:27  <batey96>  Hi, please what is the status for "Refactor/automate infusion documentation"?Does the organisation still look forward for this work to be done or the interest on it is dropped?. thought of starting to work for it as of now
2020-10-19T22:20:42  <gmoss> Hi batey96! We had a volunteer who did a bit of work on it over the summer, but the work still needs to be completed. We'd be delighted to have your help on it, if you're willing, though we'd have to talk about how to plan the work and look at exactly what still needs to be done
2020-10-19T22:22:25  <gmoss> batey96: here's the PR where the work was being done: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/187
