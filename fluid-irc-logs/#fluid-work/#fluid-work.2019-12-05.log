2019-12-05T12:09:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, I was thinking more about FLUID-6420 and wonder if I should just refactor so that the builders are a sub component of fluid.uiOptions instead of grades on it, and that they somehow supply grades to sibling subcomponents for the store, enhancer and prefsEditorLoader
2019-12-05T12:10:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  I wonder if that would be clearer/cleaner and would also step around the issues we've been running into with the grade merging
2019-12-05T12:12:51  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you are up so early these days :)
2019-12-05T12:13:32  <Bosmon> Justin_o - that's a good idea for refactoring but I don't think it would resolve this particular issue we are facing
2019-12-05T12:14:06  <Bosmon> It's true that fluid.uiOptions is now extremely crowded but the fault in the framework is biting pretty early in the composition process, which I am fixing now
2019-12-05T12:15:56  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. I was thinking that we'd be doing all the grade merging in the parent, for the preferences option. So we wouldn't be accessing it till the builder sub component. So by that time it should be at the correct value and the order of the invoker gradeNames should not matter.
2019-12-05T12:16:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the essential competition between the internal composition and the externally applied contextAwareness would be the same
2019-12-05T12:17:33  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay..I'll hang off on this, and try to get our current implementation work with your upcoming fix. In the meantime I'm going to keep looking into the testem issue with Firefox on Windows
2019-12-05T12:17:50  <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for that, I wonder if the-t-in-rtf has any ideas
2019-12-05T12:21:38  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: if you have any thoughts on the testem issue we're running into, I'd be happy to hear them. Also would like to know your best practices for debugging testem if possible.
2019-12-05T12:52:14  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I'm working to reproduce the issues now.
2019-12-05T12:52:22  <the-t-in-rtf> Just didn't see your note.
2019-12-05T12:55:19  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks
2019-12-05T13:07:26  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I don't have any environment locally where I can reproduce, I left a note for @Bosmon
2019-12-05T13:07:46  <the-t-in-rtf> Once my meetings are done I can reboot into baremetal windows and try there.
2019-12-05T13:09:33  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks
2019-12-05T13:09:54  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: how do I set the headless flag if I run the testem example?
2019-12-05T13:10:09  <the-t-in-rtf> that's a good question
2019-12-05T13:12:09  <the-t-in-rtf> just confirming that the HEADLESS environment variable was my own thing and not piggybacked on a feature of Testem
2019-12-05T13:12:13  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah
2019-12-05T13:13:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I think I made that because there wasn't a single flag for that in Testem
2019-12-05T13:14:07  <the-t-in-rtf> I had to check because Webdriver added one after I did something similar in that project.
2019-12-05T13:14:50  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I was looking at your comments here and it seemed like it might be a command line argument but that didn't seem to work https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/1377
2019-12-05T13:15:16  <the-t-in-rtf> no, that's a browser argb
2019-12-05T13:15:20  <the-t-in-rtf> arg, even
2019-12-05T13:15:23  <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2019-12-05T13:15:54  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/testem/testem/blob/master/docs/browser_args.md#an-example
2019-12-05T13:16:30  <the-t-in-rtf> So, the answer to your question is, you can add the flag to the testem.json file they provide
2019-12-05T13:17:41  <Justin_o> okay, I'll try that, thanks
2019-12-05T13:20:18  <the-t-in-rtf> same caveats apply about merging arrays, by rights I should probably transform an object into the structure they expect.
2019-12-05T13:20:30  <the-t-in-rtf> but if you're just using their example you're fine
2019-12-05T13:20:51  <the-t-in-rtf> it's just, once you start using gpii-testem you have consider the merging issue
2019-12-05T13:25:48  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, thanks.. so of course the simple example doesn't seem to be throwing any errors. although I didn't get them all the time in my CI runs either.
2019-12-05T13:26:19  <Justin_o> I'll try to see if I can get it to fail with my branch again
2019-12-05T13:28:00  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the note on how to set the environment variable in Windows.. I was looking the up. Also FF doesn't seem to want to close, so I'll try to run it headless.
2019-12-05T13:28:16  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I saw that as well.
2019-12-05T13:28:20  <the-t-in-rtf> woop, meeting.
2019-12-05T13:28:25  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll still be on chat.
2019-12-05T13:29:34  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, nm
2019-12-05T13:29:38  <the-t-in-rtf> it's not for a half hour
2019-12-05T13:29:41  <the-t-in-rtf> carry on
2019-12-05T13:32:12  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks, of course the tests are all completing fine for me in my windows 10 vm when run with the HEADLESS environment variable
2019-12-05T13:32:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: which version of Windows are you running?
2019-12-05T13:34:37  <Bosmon> Justin_o, the-t-in-rtf - sorry for the waste of time, see recent comments on the pull
2019-12-05T13:36:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, that's really interesting. I wonder if that's related to the issue I saw in CI. Maybe Firefox was in the middle of an update or something when the test was run
2019-12-05T13:36:14  <the-t-in-rtf> I think it was incredibly valuable, since we now know there's a simple enough solution.
2019-12-05T13:36:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Plus I am never sorry when we don't end up with another intractable problem that I can't reproduce or help with.
2019-12-05T13:37:14  <Justin_o> :) that's true
2019-12-05T13:38:31  <Bosmon> My process list is so long that I ordinarily never have any incentive to see if there is something suspicious there
2019-12-05T13:38:55  <Bosmon> And given the main Firefox UI seemed happy to open and close without disturbing the zombies there was no hint they were lurking there
2019-12-05T13:39:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it's somewhat amazing that you were able to track that down. It's kind of an obscure issue.
2019-12-05T13:40:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: anyways, the CI seems to have happily run after the PR was merged. Thanks. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/commit/5c58711da2f94b7446cdf42dad80466ce37acc5c/checks?check_suite_id=343732779
2019-12-05T13:40:45  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well once the Firefox I could see was updated to version 71 it was pretty clear something odd was up : P
2019-12-05T13:41:17  <Bosmon> It's interesting that the Firefox updater doesn't actually bother to clear all stale processes out of memory, I suspect the Chrome one wouldn't be that careless
2019-12-05T13:41:39  <the-t-in-rtf> If I hadn't started playing a game that required rebooting into Windows every night then I'd be right there with you, @bosmon.
2019-12-05T13:42:05  <the-t-in-rtf> On my old machine I often had ultra-long-running content in dozens of windows.
2019-12-05T13:42:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: too bad yzen isn't around for this conversation ;)
2019-12-05T13:42:44  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: did you get your new MacBook?
2019-12-05T13:42:52  <the-t-in-rtf> I did.
2019-12-05T13:42:57  <Justin_o> how is it?
2019-12-05T13:43:07  <Bosmon> Well, this machine hasn't been rebooted since September : P
2019-12-05T13:43:13  <Bosmon> I can't afford to do it all that often : P
2019-12-05T13:43:18  <the-t-in-rtf> It doesn't help with provisioning VMs (lots of downloads), but very definitely can handle the load of running them (and lots of other stuff) better.
2019-12-05T13:44:14  <the-t-in-rtf> It's also six years newer and much beefier
2019-12-05T13:44:20  <the-t-in-rtf> plus the screen is incredible
2019-12-05T13:44:30  <Justin_o> and I'm sure you're happy with the keyboard
2019-12-05T13:45:00  <Justin_o> Bosmon: does that mean you haven't even performed OS updates since September?
2019-12-05T13:45:09  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf good afternoon, I was wondering if you know something about this fail I had in the CI https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/1975/console, looks like the problem are the transforms for the applications specific settings
2019-12-05T13:45:34  <the-t-in-rtf> I haven't had any huge "uh oh"s with our stack and Catalina, thankfully.
2019-12-05T13:45:51  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @javjarfer[m], looking now
2019-12-05T13:45:54  <javjarfer[m]> looks like all the application specific terms have been deleted from master by the-t-in-rtf  in previous branches, regarding schema verification
2019-12-05T13:46:05  <javjarfer[m]> like this ones https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/625/files#diff-2bc279b41a7893626194777757cfc8d7R16
2019-12-05T13:46:07  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I'm still quite tempted to upgrade to the 16" but trying to hold off  a bit longer. I'm still debating if I should switch to a smaller machine if they migrate the updates to those
2019-12-05T13:46:09  <javjarfer[m]> Hi the-t-in-rtf
2019-12-05T13:46:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I haven't performed OS updates ever : P
2019-12-05T13:46:33  <the-t-in-rtf> The 16 is actually lighter than my old 15 inch.
2019-12-05T13:46:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I can't turn on a windows machine or VM without having to wait for it to do updates
2019-12-05T13:47:01  <the-t-in-rtf> and you can add an incredible amount of RAM beyond what they offer on the smaller models
2019-12-05T13:47:33  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: oh really.. I guess it's a bit heavier than it's predecessor but smaller the the pre-butterfly keyboard models
2019-12-05T13:47:38  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, @Justin_o, but you haven't spent hours nailing down and disabling every little thing that would try to drag you into the future.
2019-12-05T13:47:50  <Justin_o> lol true
2019-12-05T13:48:01  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that's right, I had a pre-butterfly one.

2019-12-05T13:48:10  <javjarfer[m]> so, I was wondering if application specific transforms are now not supported, since they are no remaining one in master and looks like they fail the checks, this breaks current user API, since the access to that settings is intended to be done by means of this transforms
2019-12-05T13:48:25  <the-t-in-rtf> that whole trick of writing zeroes to a skype binary is just great.
2019-12-05T13:48:47  <Bosmon> Yes, sadly that one stopped working
2019-12-05T13:49:05  <Bosmon> The only surefire way of preventing Windows updates is to stick at Windows 7
2019-12-05T13:49:29  <Bosmon> I had a few experimental Windows 10 machines but found that in the end there was no way to win
2019-12-05T13:49:43  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], link to the finn.json5 file in your branch?
2019-12-05T13:50:05  <the-t-in-rtf> it may be that I missed an edge case in the schema, it would help to see that.
2019-12-05T13:50:48  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: here is the link https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/830/files#diff-8847cbec986809a645a00e088329bd22R1
2019-12-05T13:51:18  <javjarfer[m]> I don't think it's an edge case, since I can't find any other transforms from prefs sets in the current master branch
2019-12-05T13:51:20  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, and the focusAssist schema?
2019-12-05T13:51:41  <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/830/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R6499
2019-12-05T13:51:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the test is complaining about finn.json5, and not about a transform.
2019-12-05T13:53:35  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, why do the keys not even remotely match?
2019-12-05T13:53:43  *** jhernandez <jhernandez!~jhernande@2a02:a03f:3efa:9300:73a:42e3:af0e:b949> has joined #fluid-work
2019-12-05T13:54:05  <the-t-in-rtf> You use "Mode" in finn.json5, but the actual setting is a whopper, "SystemSettings_Notifications_DoNotDisturb_Toggle
2019-12-05T13:54:10  <javjarfer[m]> because settings are used by means of the transforms
2019-12-05T13:54:12  <the-t-in-rtf> They have to match.
2019-12-05T13:54:29  <the-t-in-rtf> that's not how that test validates them
2019-12-05T13:54:31  <javjarfer[m]> that's the procedure for exposing convenient names for system settings
2019-12-05T13:54:53  <the-t-in-rtf> it expects to work only with "simple" values.
2019-12-05T13:55:14  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, then the checks will need to be made aware of how things work now.
2019-12-05T13:55:39  <the-t-in-rtf> Or we have to agree to make them work like they always have.
2019-12-05T13:56:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, we've talked about application transforms before, but I didn't think anyone had made that possible.  @Bosmon?

2019-12-05T13:56:54  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: I don't know, but I think the procedure for this have been always to use transforms to expose system settings through convenient names, like in this old preference sets which were also deleted https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/624/files#diff-efba155ec49c6a8cf16a2c4ea84f346aR1
2019-12-05T13:59:09  <the-t-in-rtf> right, so you mean this transform here? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/624/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R6725
2019-12-05T13:59:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I assumed that was left over from long ago, but maybe I missed something.
2019-12-05T13:59:54  <the-t-in-rtf> Unfortunately many of us have a meeting in a minute, we should maybe talk it through tomorrow.
2019-12-05T14:00:07  <the-t-in-rtf> like before the onboarding meeting
2019-12-05T14:00:13  <the-t-in-rtf> or right after depending
2019-12-05T14:02:45  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf , yes, exactly, that transform, yes we could have a meeting before the onboarding meeting tomorrow

2019-12-05T23:04:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. I'll take a look at that.. I had to split my day a little bit, so on early and late :)
2019-12-05T23:08:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that's interesting.. so for the gradeNames definition.. if there are more than one it would an array of objects, or an object keyed off the namespace?
2019-12-05T23:21:30  <Justin_o> Bosmon: for gradeNames that are provided in an array, is the namespace the actual grade?
2019-12-05T23:26:44  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the namespace is currently ignored
2019-12-05T23:26:50  <Bosmon> It's just "aspirational" : P
2019-12-05T23:27:26  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay, so priorities like "before:something" won't work.. just "first", "last" and numerical values?
2019-12-05T23:27:47  <Bosmon> Actually just "first" and "last"
2019-12-05T23:27:50  <Bosmon> It's good enough for now : P
2019-12-05T23:27:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay :)
2019-12-05T23:28:35  <Justin_o> I'm going to rebase my FLUID-6420 PR off of your FLUID-6148 branch.. and attempt to carry on.. although I'm scared of the potential merge conflicts
2019-12-05T23:28:48  <Bosmon> If we really meant business with namespaces, we'd have to change the entire way grade overriding worked
2019-12-05T23:29:00  <Bosmon> And I think we've accumulated enough incompatibilities for now
2019-12-05T23:29:38  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. we also should decide how many changes we want to the prefs framework before we do a 3.0 release
2019-12-05T23:29:47  <Justin_o> this is already a substantial change I think
2019-12-05T23:30:11  <Justin_o> in that I'm probably already going to have to re-write much of the documentation I'd imagine
2019-12-05T23:31:04  <Bosmon> Yes, big doco updates are coming
2019-12-05T23:33:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was talking to michelled and jhung today about providing a starting point for information about UIO. I guess for those that want to integrate it. Ideally we'd have something for February.. is that still realistic for a timeframe and would we be able to get a 3.0 release out by then
2019-12-05T23:36:34  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, is your FLUID-6148 branch up-to-date with master?
