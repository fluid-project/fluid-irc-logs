2019-10-25T15:20:08  <cindyli> Bosmon, sgithens, the-t-in-rtf, I added a summary table of drawbacks of 3 databases into the google doc "new database requirements". in the next meeting, we can go thru it to figure out how easy or hard to tackle each drawback. it would be helpful if you guys can have a look in case I missed anything. thanks
