2019-01-26T11:58:33  <the-t-in-rtf1> Hi, @aayush, most of us don't work on Saturday, I just saw this by coincidence.
2019-01-26T11:59:22  <the-t-in-rtf1> Here's a link my colleague shared earlier that might be of use: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2019+with+the+Fluid+Project
2019-01-26T11:59:37  <the-t-in-rtf1> read up on that, there will be a lot more people active during US working hours next week if you have questions.
2019-01-26T12:04:08  <aayush> Thank you so much @the-t-in-rtf1
