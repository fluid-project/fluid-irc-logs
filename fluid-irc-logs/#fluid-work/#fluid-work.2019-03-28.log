2019-03-28T12:23:10  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon , quick question, do you know where this "that" parameter is constructed? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L292
2019-03-28T12:23:27  *** jhung <jhung!~Adium@CPE54a0505a5e09-CMa84e3f431590.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-28T12:23:49  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - it's right here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L227
2019-03-28T12:25:53  <javjarfer[m]> yes, sorry, saw that, but I don't know where the object is actually constructed, there I can only see it's definition as a parameter for the "getImpl" "invoker"
2019-03-28T12:26:48  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - mock settings handlers are constructed here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L349
2019-03-28T12:29:52  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  interesting, so "that" is populated within that function?
2019-03-28T12:40:51  <javjarfer[m]> sorry Bosmon , I can't still find where "that.settingsStore" is populated

2019-03-28T13:00:58  <Bosmon> Each test run sets up some initial conditions in its first sequence sets

2019-03-28T13:08:14  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon , yes but here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L293 it's required to contain a key that should hold the settings
2019-03-28T13:08:44  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m], well it will, once settings are stored in it : P
2019-03-28T13:08:47  <Bosmon> I'm not quite sure what the questio nis
2019-03-28T13:09:52  <javjarfer[m]> I wanted to find the point in which settings are stored into it, because this is the cause of the error of my latest pull
2019-03-28T13:10:48  <javjarfer[m]> of the two keys that should be hold, just once is actually there, leading to "undefined" values in the settings

2019-03-28T16:06:03  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding distributing a member option, i tried with
2019-03-28T16:06:08  <cindyli> record: "{that}.defaultLifecycleInstructions"
2019-03-28T16:06:11  <cindyli> it doesn't work.
2019-03-28T16:06:27  <cindyli> do you mean i should first resolve it as an option
2019-03-28T16:06:48  <Bosmon> cindyli - record would never work because it is the wrong component
2019-03-28T16:06:57  <Bosmon> You mean source: "{that}.defaultLifecycleInstructions"
2019-03-28T16:06:58  <cindyli> right
2019-03-28T16:07:02  <cindyli> source
2019-03-28T16:07:14  <cindyli> ok
2019-03-28T16:10:13  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay, the weird thing so far is that, there is only one spec passed to the "gpii.lifecycleManager.invokeSettingsHandlerSet" regarding this particular solution, and it's this one

2019-03-28T16:23:43  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding what you said in the review comment: "we should be updating the "default" value in the reported schema", what is the reported schema? is the "default" value the setting value from reset to std file?
2019-03-28T16:24:50  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2019-03-28T16:25:05  <Bosmon> cindyli - for every "settingsControl" we report over the PSP channel, we also report a block of "schema"
2019-03-28T16:25:24  <Bosmon> But at present this schema takes its default value from the solutions registry or else the ontology file
2019-03-28T16:25:36  <Bosmon> We should instead report as the default value the one which is held in the reset to standard file
2019-03-28T16:26:00  <cindyli> ah ok. i see
2019-03-28T16:26:51  <cindyli> so "settingsControl" block should be untouched
2019-03-28T16:27:11  <Bosmon> cindyli - isn't the schema a member of this block?
2019-03-28T16:27:37  <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PSPChannel.js#L160

2019-03-28T16:39:18  <cindyli> Bosmon: another question, in the review comment you said: "we should not be leaving any settings in the model". i guess this is my bad from my previous reply. it was "settingControls" block holding default settings that will remain in the pspChannel.model. this is correct, right? I hope you are not saying this initial "settingControls" should be set to empty once psp channel sends out the initial response
2019-03-28T16:44:07  <Bosmon> cindyli - I meant we should be leaving any settings *VALUES* in the model :)
2019-03-28T16:44:24  <Bosmon> That is, we should not put a "value" into the settingsControls structure if there was not one already generated by the core
2019-03-28T16:45:43  <Bosmon> i.e. that this assignment remains unchanged, and we do not do anything further with this value: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PSPChannel.js#L159
2019-03-28T16:47:26  <cindyli> i think now i finally understand. this value should be left empty and the default value from reset file should be set into "schema.default". thanks, Bosmon
2019-03-28T16:47:49  <Bosmon> cindyli - cheers
2019-03-28T16:48:11  <Bosmon> This method will also be forward-compatible in that the HA team can opt into it whenever they are ready
2019-03-28T16:48:30  <cindyli> great

2019-03-28T18:25:24  <sgithens> cindyli: I'm wondering, even if we're avoiding large merges in universal/master at the moment, if you're comfortable with GPII-2966 now, if you could just maybe sign off on it in the comments on the PR that it is ready, and then either myself or someone could do the actual physical merge after you leave as soon as it's ok to merge large things in to universal
2019-03-28T18:28:40  <cindyli> ya, it makes total sense, sgithens. due to the size of this pull, I haven't got to it yet ;) sorry. i will make sure to have another review and test on it by tomorrow.
2019-03-28T18:29:07  <sgithens> cindyli: Great, thanks!
2019-03-28T18:29:59  <sgithens> hopefully it should be ready... or otherwise very very very extremely close :)
2019-03-28T18:32:22  <cindyli> i believe it should be extremely close. let's see

2019-03-28T18:34:19  <jhernandez> hey GPII'ers - FYI, I've just shared with testers the installer that we think is what is going to be first tested at NOVA
2019-03-28T18:35:04  <jhernandez> I really appreciate the work that YOU ALL put into this :)
2019-03-28T18:36:18  <javjarfer[m]> wow, don't forget about yourself jhernandez

2019-03-28T20:08:11  <colinclark> hey cindyli, I know you’re in a meeting right now, so ignore me until you’re done…
2019-03-28T20:08:25  <colinclark> but is there any chance you’d be free to give a Morphic demo tomorrow to our funders from ISED?
2019-03-28T20:24:09  <cindyli> sure, colinclark.
2019-03-28T20:24:21  <colinclark> I hear you’re working pretty late tonight, are you sure that’s ok?
2019-03-28T20:24:33  <colinclark> or would you rather if we see if alanharnum can do one?
2019-03-28T20:25:44  <cindyli> it would be great if alanharnum can do it. otherwise, i'm fine with demoing it tomorrow. working late happens sometimes to all of us ;)
2019-03-28T20:26:11  <colinclark> so is taking time off :)
2019-03-28T20:26:24  <colinclark> what do you think, alanharnum?
2019-03-28T20:26:34  <alanharnum> cindyli colinclark: I'm happy to do it - let me just check that everything I need is in the locker and working :)
2019-03-28T20:26:47  <colinclark> ok, cool
2019-03-28T20:39:58  <alanharnum> cindyli colinclark: all looks good with the demo rig - I'm not going to update Morphic on it at this time (not sure when that was last done)

2019-03-28T20:44:42  <cindyli> great. thanks, alanharnum. I'm also not sure which Morphic version that windows surface uses. but should be ok as it has all major features that the latest Morphic has

2019-03-28T20:49:57  <colinclark> and cindyli, don’t work too late! :)

2019-03-28T23:35:40  <stegru> jhernandez, when upgrading, the installer now closes GPII and there's no file in use prompt. there's now a universal PR for the service
