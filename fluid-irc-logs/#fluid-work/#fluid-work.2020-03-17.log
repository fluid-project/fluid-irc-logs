2020-03-17T00:38:00  <moemen_elsayeh> Hellp, I am Moemen from Egypt.
2020-03-17T00:38:17  <moemen_elsayeh>  I have a good experience in web development.
2020-03-17T00:39:32  <moemen_elsayeh> I would love to contribute to the "Migrate FLOE and Fluid project websites to a Modern Static Site Generator" Project
2020-03-17T00:40:59  <gmoss> Hi moemen_elsayeh, welcome. The best place to get started is the "how to get started" section of the project description that lays out a few steps that will help you produce a good proposal: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project#GoogleSummerofCode2020withtheFluidProject-MigrateFLOEandFluidprojectwebsitestoaModernStaticSiteGenerator
2020-03-17T00:45:45  <moemen_elsayeh> I read the "How to get started" section and I want to ask is there any issues to resolve or to contribute to it ?
2020-03-17T00:49:30  <gmoss> moemen_elsayeh: Since we may do a redesign of the site after the migration project is complete, I wouldn't worry as much about fixing any bugs currently on the site. Better to focus on researching which static site generator you would use and prepare your proposal
2020-03-17T00:51:12  <moemen_elsayeh> Okay, Thank You
2020-03-17T00:51:21  <gmoss> you're welcome :)

2020-03-17T09:41:31  <Shyamal> the-t-in-rtf: Shall I discuss about one particular approach that I feel is the best or should I specify other alternate approaches that I have regarding the workflow of the project?
2020-03-17T09:42:00  *** hitgo <hitgo!~Adium@123.201.228.60> has joined #fluid-work
2020-03-17T09:42:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I think you should discuss a range of approaches, but include your best guess as to which is most promising.
2020-03-17T09:42:50  <the-t-in-rtf> and keep the level of detail fairly light.
2020-03-17T09:43:17  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the proposal is kind of a test run for what you'll really have to do, which is try out a bunch of things in more depth and make a more informed decision.
2020-03-17T09:50:01  <SemicolonExp> Hi, the-t-in-rtf. I did some thinking and was curious as to why we're using a web based solution vs a full application. I reason that if you can emulate a keyboard for a whole OS, then you can simulate the same shortcuts in the browser from the application as well as have the functionalities of being able to use that operating system's shortcuts
2020-03-17T09:50:02  <SemicolonExp> too from the game pad
2020-03-17T09:50:31  <SemicolonExp> I guess my question is why are we limiting it to only operating inside a browser?
2020-03-17T09:51:06  *** hitgo78 <hitgo78!7bc9e43c@123.201.228.60> has joined #fluid-work
2020-03-17T09:55:24  <the-t-in-rtf> we're not per se.
2020-03-17T09:55:48  <the-t-in-rtf> the examples I gave were based on web technologies because that's mainly what the community uses.
2020-03-17T09:56:04  <the-t-in-rtf> but certainly something that can send key presses at the OS level is of interest.
2020-03-17T09:56:19  <the-t-in-rtf> However, it should be something that works across platforms and that can be supported by the community.
2020-03-17T09:57:13  <SemicolonExp> Ah I see so the big challenge may be cross os compatiblity
2020-03-17T09:57:15  <the-t-in-rtf> And also should not add too much in the way of cost.
2020-03-17T09:57:39  <the-t-in-rtf> Another candidate and I were discussing using an IoT board to allow you to just act as a keyboard
2020-03-17T09:57:40  <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.espruino.com/USB
2020-03-17T09:58:03  <the-t-in-rtf> for example, the espruino board uses Javascript and supports acting as an external keyboard.
2020-03-17T09:59:00  <the-t-in-rtf> it may even be possible to use that with mobile devices via bluetooth
2020-03-17T09:59:27  <the-t-in-rtf> So by that I mean that starting with a web technology you have the potential to reach both mobile and computing devices
2020-03-17T09:59:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Although we do of course limit the scope of real-world projects, there should be a clear understanding of what we're giving up with each decision
2020-03-17T10:00:15  <the-t-in-rtf> or what we gain
2020-03-17T10:01:30  <the-t-in-rtf> and in the case of keyboard presses on a range of OSes, maybe we do gain enough (control of other apps) to limit the scope of what we mean by "cross platform"
2020-03-17T10:01:47  <the-t-in-rtf> that help?
2020-03-17T10:02:26  <SemicolonExp> yes, it definitely gives me a lot to think about

2020-03-17T10:45:57  <the-t-in-rtf> @dmahajan980, that is a very good point
2020-03-17T10:46:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I think it's a very good idea to at least have some idea of how we might test the work
2020-03-17T10:46:24  <the-t-in-rtf> both in terms of unit and functional tests
2020-03-17T10:46:45  <the-t-in-rtf> welcome, @boyio, did you have any questions about the project?
2020-03-17T10:47:53  <dmahajan980> Thanks @the-t-inrtf for the suggestions. Also, are we flexible in terms of choosing the testing frameworks or do we have to stick to some particular ones?
2020-03-17T10:49:07  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf ^^^
2020-03-17T10:49:12  <boyio> do i have to solve any issue for the proposal or write any test ?
2020-03-17T10:49:26  <dmahajan980> Sorry for the typo
2020-03-17T10:49:42  <boyio> also the project will be an extension or application ?
2020-03-17T10:50:32  <the-t-in-rtf> @dmahajan980, we can be flexiible, although you should be familiar with what we already use and be able to discuss whether it will work
2020-03-17T10:50:48  <sachin10101998> boyio solving issues is not a necessity for submitting your application. Writing tests in your proposal or not is your choice.
2020-03-17T10:50:53  <the-t-in-rtf> so you should read up on jqunit and also the package we use for browser control (just a second, link coming)
2020-03-17T10:51:12  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-webdriver
2020-03-17T10:51:32  <the-t-in-rtf> @boyio, the project summary made it clear that we were still deciding that
2020-03-17T10:51:47  <the-t-in-rtf> it might be a chrome extension, or might be an electron app or might be some other thing
2020-03-17T10:54:04  <dmahajan980> Awesome @the-t-in-rtf! I will try this out and then do some thinking about whether it can fit the requirements.
2020-03-17T10:54:30  <the-t-in-rtf> We've never written any tests to simulate gamepad input, very curious to hear about anything in that area.
2020-03-17T10:54:57  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. how do you know your code is responding to gamepad inputs correclty.
2020-03-17T10:55:57  <the-t-in-rtf> sometimes you have to make something that simulates it, my guess is that's what we'll have to do
2020-03-17T10:56:08  <the-t-in-rtf> but I'd assume that game companies do something to test their work
2020-03-17T10:57:07  <dmahajan980> I am still thinking about that. One related thought that I came across my mind was some sort of synchronizer that can sync the keypresses and test the inputs at the same time.
2020-03-17T10:58:53  <boyio> that was helped me thank you. i will figure it out

2020-03-17T16:22:31  <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb, philip
2020-03-17T16:22:42  <Bosmon> Thanks for your awesome kickstarter pulls, simonjb!
2020-03-17T16:23:46  <Bosmon> I've merged most of them, and the co-occurrence engine is now working against the most recent nexus which is published in npm as 0.3.0-dev.20200305T224303Z.59892d3
2020-03-17T16:24:43  <Bosmon> I reissued the nexus-client pull as https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-nexus-client/pull/2 since it needed to be renamed all the rest of the way since we don't actually have a usable tag of something called "infusion-nexus" at version 0.2.0
2020-03-17T16:25:52  <Bosmon> I merged your pull against https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-nexus-demos largely as is since I could at least get the client code to seemingly start up, but I can't build the binary dependencies so far under Windows so can't test out further
2020-03-17T16:27:59  <sachin10101998> Hey gmoss Justin_o colinclark jhung I researched about Github actions. Even though switching from jenkins to GA would be a great step up in the present tech stack of Fluid, but it would require good amount of time to make the whole migration. There are no tools currently available to migrate pipelines from jenkins to github actions directly. Github actions has its own syntax which has to be created manually. We'd have to configure the github
2020-03-17T16:28:00  <sachin10101998> workflow from scratch. The time required for this would not fit in the present time alloted for this programme. Although I have added this to my wishlist/future prospects in the draft proposal.
2020-03-17T16:29:44  <sachin10101998> The advantages of GA compared to Jenkins are numerous. The migration of while all fluid-projects from Jenkins to GA can be done incrementally.
2020-03-17T16:30:56  <sachin10101998> I read in the fluid wiki that we can suggest our own project ideas for GSoC. Is it worthy for someone to work on this topic as an independent project?
2020-03-17T16:35:20  <simonjb> that's great, thanks Bosmon

2020-03-17T16:36:23  <colinclark> sachin10101998: It doesn’t strike me as needing to be a separate project
2020-03-17T16:36:40  <sachin10101998> alright
2020-03-17T16:36:41  <colinclark> especially if we’re just talking about migrating the website build process for Fluid and FLOE to Github Actions
2020-03-17T16:37:06  <colinclark> I’d suggest that it would make a good “stretch goal” in any proposal for that project
2020-03-17T16:37:08  <sachin10101998> Although, If I would like to to migrate it, what should be the starting point
2020-03-17T16:37:13  <gmoss> sachin10101998: I agree with colinclark. It's the sort of thing that can be added to a proposal as an additional task, if the primary task is completed ahead of schedule
2020-03-17T16:37:26  <colinclark> My impression is that migrating to a new static site generator and doing some updates the site isn’t a huge, summer-long project for most studnets
2020-03-17T16:37:37  <sachin10101998> Hmm I've added it in the future prospect/wishlist in the proposal.
2020-03-17T16:37:50  <colinclark> so a big part of the way we’ll be evaluating proposals is whether they include tangible, useful work beyond the immediate scope of the project
2020-03-17T16:38:40  <sachin10101998> colinclark true. In my draft proposal, I have included that part in the first phase itself. I have my draft proposal ready. should I send it for review?
2020-03-17T16:40:19  <gmoss> sachin10101998: If you think your draft is ready for review, then please do feel free to submit it via the GSoC website

2020-03-17T16:41:47  <sachin10101998> Alright. Just a small question. Can the review or feedback be taken multiple times or is there some restriction on the number of times you can review it in through the gsoc portal
2020-03-17T16:43:49  <gmoss> sachin10101998: if I understand correctly, the draft is submitted as a Google Doc, so it's an editable document
2020-03-17T16:44:08  <gmoss> I don't know what the interface will look like on your end, there may be some instruction on the GSoC site
2020-03-17T16:45:52  <sachin10101998> Yeah. It was editable last time too. I have completed the theoretical prt of the proposal but still need to add wireframes and diagrams. I'd send it after adding them so you guys won't have to review it again and again.
2020-03-17T16:48:38  <ravgeetdhillon[m> Hello everyone. I am Ravgeet and I am looking to contribute towards migrating the Fluif and FLOE websites to a Modern Static Site Generator like Jekyll or Hugo.
2020-03-17T16:48:38  <ravgeetdhillon[m> Last year I did a project on the similar lines for GNOME where I revamped the design, established Jekyll as SSG and deployment the website using Gitlab CI.
2020-03-17T16:49:39  <ravgeetdhillon[m> This year I am looking for a new challenge and would love to be the part of this Fluid community.
2020-03-17T16:50:38  <ravgeetdhillon[m> You can take a look here https://gtk.org
2020-03-17T16:51:50  <gmoss> welcome, ravgeetdhillon[m! if you haven't already, I would recommend checking out our Wiki page for some steps on how to get started: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project#GoogleSummerofCode2020withtheFluidProject-MigrateFLOEandFluidprojectwebsitestoaModernStaticSiteGenerator
2020-03-17T16:52:39  <ravgeetdhillon[m> Can the mentors for the project please tell me what are some detailed requirements for the project. I would love to start drafting the proposal.
2020-03-17T16:54:03  <gmoss> ravgeetdhillon[m: The relevant details can be found on the wiki page :) if you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask them in this channel or on the fluid-work mailing list
2020-03-17T17:06:46  <ravgeetdhillon[m> Thanks gmoss . Actually right now I am confused between two projects one is migration of fluid website and other one is refactoring and automating the documentation. Both are catching up my interest. 😄
2020-03-17T17:08:56  <dmahajan980> Hi @ravgeetdhillon[m! You can submit 3 proposals so you can go for both ideas.
2020-03-17T17:09:43  <gmoss> ravgeetdhillon[m: they're very similar projects! and yes, as dmahajan980 said you are able to submit a proposal for each of them, if you like. you are only allowed to submit 3 proposals in total to any GSoC organizations this year, so that's worth keeping in mind
2020-03-17T17:09:56  <gmoss> *3 proposals across all organizations
2020-03-17T17:10:58  <ravgeetdhillon[m> Yeah sure that's in my knowledge. Okk I will start preparing a proposal and get back to you if I need any help. Thanks for your time.

2020-03-17T17:26:39  <sachin10101998> gmoss can we submit two proposals for the same project? It's hard to choose between HUGO and Jekyll. Jekyll comes with gh-pages compatibility. If we host FLOE and Fluid on gh-pages, any commit made to these repos would be automatically built and thus there is no need for an automation server. This however comes with the downside of strict file structure that Jekyll uses. All the content files will have to be stored in data and iterating
2020-03-17T17:26:39  <sachin10101998> through a few of them sometimes becomes impossible as site.data.directory takes into account all of the files present in the given directory. Hugo provides with a much more flexible structure and better Go templating compared to Liquid, but it's not readily compatible with gh-pages i.e. we will need an automation server to automate the builds for every commit. I wanted to know if automation of builds without using Jenkins is a good enough
2020-03-17T17:26:40  <sachin10101998> reason to choose Jekyll over HUGO? HUGO presents itself as a better alternative on all fronts except when it comes to integration with gh-pages.

2020-03-17T17:34:10  <gmoss> sachin10101998: It would be best to settle on one particular solution. I'm not sure the GSoC interface would allow you to submit two proposals for the same project, and we will only accept officially submitted proposals. Our priority will be something that can be deployed reliably and with minimal effort when it comes to adding new content, maintaining old posts, etc., so hopefully that's helpful in making your choice
2020-03-17T17:34:47  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: you might want to build in more time for investigation/exploration if that is something that is still needed

2020-03-17T18:06:44  <colinclark> sachin10101998: From my perspective, your proposal doesn’t have to include a final decision on which static site generator to use
2020-03-17T18:06:57  <colinclark> I still fully expect that there may be some community motivations for choosing one tool or another
2020-03-17T18:07:08  <colinclark> which should be decided as part of doing the project, not just the proposal
2020-03-17T18:07:24  <colinclark> I think your proposal can and should outline which ones you think are most promising/appropriate/etc.
2020-03-17T18:07:56  <colinclark> so a single proposal that includes time, as Justin_o said, for investigation and decision-making with the mentors and community
2020-03-17T18:19:22  <sachin10101998> colinclark thanks a lot for that. I'd keep in this in mind.

2020-03-17T20:48:27  <cindyli> stegru: steps to find out: 1. find the client credential you use in the computer where the save is performed; 2. look into the CouchDB to find this client credential; 3. here's an example of a client credential record in CouchDB: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Enhanced_Data_Model_for_NOVA#Example_of_a_New_Client_Credentials_document

2020-03-17T20:48:52  <cindyli> there's a field called "allowedPrefsToWrite", that volume preference needs to be in its array

2020-03-17T20:50:44  <cindyli> step 2 (find the client credential from the CouchDB) might be a bit tricky because you need to know the "_id" to find that record instead of "oauth2ClientId". what i usually do is to look at the flow manager log file to find this "_id"
2020-03-17T20:50:55  <stegru> nice one cindyli, thanks
2020-03-17T20:50:59  <stegru> ah ok
