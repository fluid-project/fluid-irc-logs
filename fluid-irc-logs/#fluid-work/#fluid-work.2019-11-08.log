2019-11-08T15:03:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm looking into the comment from the FLUID-6420 PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/967#discussion_r343908845
2019-11-08T15:03:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if I'm understanding correctly, you are suggesting to use https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCAPI.html#fluidmakegradelinkagelinkagename-inputnames-outputnames
2019-11-08T15:04:11  <Justin_o> and have fluid.prefs.create be a function returning an instantiated component again.
2019-11-08T15:04:47  <Justin_o> the grade linkage would somehow happen as part of  running fluid.prefs.builder

2019-11-08T15:05:46  <Justin_o> I'm a big confused about this part "But fluid.prefs.create should be clear that it only advises the particular prefs editor that it creates itself, by running fluid.prefs.builder in a particular mode that doesn't cause the grade side-effects."
2019-11-08T15:05:56  <Justin_o> and this one "The invocation of it in UIOptions.js should be provided some special option to indicate that it is intended to have the "spooky action at a distance" effect on fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor"
2019-11-08T15:06:29  <Justin_o> and am wondering if it would be better to just change fluid.prefs.builder to not be a component
2019-11-08T15:06:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^

2019-11-08T15:23:38  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - we could convert fluid.prefs.builder into an ordinary function, yes, especially since it just seems to consist of a bunch of expanders and a giant mergePolicy
2019-11-08T15:23:46  <Bosmon3> But it would need massively better docs than it currently has now : P
2019-11-08T15:23:52  <Bosmon3> But how would that help with the original problem?
2019-11-08T15:25:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: then I can generally speaking keep what I have in the PR because it won't be calling a component in the invoker
2019-11-08T15:26:47  <Justin_o> I guess part of the question is, is it worth hacking apart the builder and auxbuilder now. The alternative seems to be modifying it and trying to keep the old system working.
2019-11-08T15:27:12  <Justin_o> granted the former sounds like a lot of work, but I'm not entirely sure how much work the latter is
2019-11-08T15:29:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-11-08T15:29:58  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - we shouldn't hack them apart too much, but I think some docs and light tidying in the AuxBuilder would be hugely useful
2019-11-08T15:30:39  <Bosmon3> Most of the functions in that file are either undocumented, or else document their arguments and returns as {Object}
2019-11-08T15:31:12  <Bosmon3> The function fluid.prefs.addCommonOptions is particularly obscure both in what it does and also in its highly side-effectful workflow
2019-11-08T15:31:36  <Bosmon3> and fluid.prefs.rearrangeDirect, whilst short, is similarly intriguing : P
2019-11-08T15:32:23  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: it might be easier to rewrite it all than to try to remember what it does ;)

2019-11-08T15:34:06  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: maybe I'll jump over to FLUID-6426 which seems like another frightening bit of work, but at least it'll stop blocking the fluid-6148 related stuff

2019-11-08T15:37:15  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - hopefully FLUID-6426 is merely awkward rather than frightening : P
2019-11-08T15:37:31  <Bosmon3> I guess as with this existing work the major challenge is trying to recall why it needs to modify its selectors in the first place
2019-11-08T15:37:34  <Justin_o> composite panels are a bit frightening
2019-11-08T15:38:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon3: I haven't looked at the code, but I think it needed to rebase the selectors
2019-11-08T15:39:43  <Justin_o> at least there's a comment for that code, even if it isn't the greatest. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L504-L509
2019-11-08T15:48:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so I think the issue is related to the renderer. I think the parent of the sub panels is handling all of the rendering
2019-11-08T15:48:23  <Justin_o> and/or the templates are being combined

2019-11-08T16:05:37  <cindyli> Bosmon: Bosmon3, i've been struggling with an interesting model change problem and need you help. To implement the new pspChannel read API, I introduced a new model path "currentPreferences" to lifecycleManager.userSession component - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3958/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L60. This model value will keep track of all preferences being applied and read. PSP
2019-11-08T16:05:37  <cindyli> Channel.sessionToPSP() will iterate thru this model value to generate the output of "settingsControls".
2019-11-08T16:06:14  <cindyli> when the read API reads a pref value, lifecycleManager function issues a model change request on userSession to update "currentPreferences" - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3958/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L648
2019-11-08T16:06:53  <cindyli> in my integration test, this model value is changed from an empty object {} to
2019-11-08T16:06:55  <cindyli> {
2019-11-08T16:06:55  <cindyli>     "http://registry.gpii.net/common/magnification": 1.5
2019-11-08T16:06:55  <cindyli> }
2019-11-08T16:07:24  <cindyli> however, this line doesn't trigger the model change
2019-11-08T16:08:10  <cindyli> i added a model listener to listen on the root path "" or "currentPreferences" and this listener is not triggered by this change request
2019-11-08T16:08:33  <Bosmon3> cindyli - that's very odd
2019-11-08T16:08:41  <Bosmon3> Is it possible to reduce this to a unit test somehow?
2019-11-08T16:09:02  <cindyli> ya. i wrote a databinding unit test and it worked fine :(
2019-11-08T16:09:39  <cindyli> the problem only happens in this complex context :'(
2019-11-08T16:09:44  <Bosmon3> Justin_o - can we determine whether these combined selectors are consumed just by the renderer or whether they are also used for general DOM binding during the lifetime of the component?

2019-11-08T18:39:19  <cindyli> Bosmon: i finally figured out why i had this model change problem. it was all my bad. this expression
2019-11-08T18:39:19  <cindyli> fluid.extend(true, session.model.currentPreferences, matchedPrefs)
2019-11-08T18:39:26  <cindyli> at the line https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3958/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L648
2019-11-08T18:39:51  <cindyli> modifies "session.model.currentPreferences" value before firing session.applier.change()
2019-11-08T18:40:18  <cindyli> changing it to
2019-11-08T18:40:18  <cindyli> session.applier.change(["currentPreferences"], fluid.extend(true, fluid.copy(session.model.currentPreferences), matchedPrefs));
2019-11-08T18:40:24  <cindyli> solves the problem
2019-11-08T18:41:12  <cindyli> what a silly mistake! it costs me almost a day

2019-11-08T19:28:05  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, @sgithens, @clown mentioned on Wednesday that he hadn't seen the email.
2019-11-08T19:28:10  <the-t-in-rtf> it finally came through
2019-11-08T19:29:47  <javjarfer[m]> sgithens: yes, it should be pretty much the same
2019-11-08T19:34:53  <sgithens> javjarfer[m]: cool, thanks
2019-11-08T19:35:05  <sgithens> I assume you'll fix it up Monday when Basman is back?
2019-11-08T19:36:09  <sgithens> or if as simple as switching back to universal any of us or me could merge it
