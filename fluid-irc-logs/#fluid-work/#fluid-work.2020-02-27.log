2020-02-27T14:15:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Welcome!
2020-02-27T14:15:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Here's a good overview of the material you should be getting to know.

2020-02-27T14:16:13  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume you've read some of that as you found the channel… ;)
2020-02-27T14:16:26  <the-t-in-rtf> But that's a good overview of the other things you should read up on.
2020-02-27T14:16:31  <the-t-in-rtf> We're here if you have any questions.

2020-02-27T14:35:21  <shrenikr235> Hey guys, I looked through some of fluid-project's repositories and found a bunch of issues I could potentially fix. Any idea how I can get assigned to these issues and start working on them?
2020-02-27T14:35:35  <shrenikr235> Thank you
2020-02-27T14:36:20  <the-t-in-rtf> is there an example, @shrenikr235?
2020-02-27T14:36:56  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @javjarfer[m], seems like we have to better flesh out both of the settings that go into that transform and/or update the transform
2020-02-27T14:37:12  <shrenikr235> @thttps://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/issues/110
2020-02-27T14:37:37  <shrenikr235> the-t-in-rtf
2020-02-27T14:37:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I think that we just need to avoid scaling the initDelay, which is already milliseconds
2020-02-27T14:37:59  <javjarfer[m]> <the-t-in-rtf "Anyway, @javjarfer[m], seems lik"> the-t-in-rtf , yes it's supposed to mean 0, the best thing may be to debug that
2020-02-27T14:38:34  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @shrenikr235, I think you'll need to wait for someone more familiar with FLOE for feedback on that one
2020-02-27T14:39:01  <shrenikr235> @the-t-in-rtf Alright, then. Thanks for your input
2020-02-27T14:39:21  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], on the face of it that transform is broken
2020-02-27T14:39:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it attempts to offset cursorAcceleration by 1000
2020-02-27T14:39:49  <the-t-in-rtf> and 1000 is the maximum allowed value
2020-02-27T14:40:49  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf , it may the that the schema values are faulty
2020-02-27T14:41:18  <the-t-in-rtf> so unless cursor acceleration is always negative, any value will break when fed through that transform
2020-02-27T14:41:24  <the-t-in-rtf> seems like it
2020-02-27T14:42:43  <the-t-in-rtf> unfortunately both of those common terms are only used in those transforms
2020-02-27T14:42:49  <the-t-in-rtf> so I can't infer the correct values.
2020-02-27T14:43:12  <the-t-in-rtf> Do we use either of those in the QSS?
2020-02-27T14:43:46  <the-t-in-rtf> whew, we don't
2020-02-27T14:43:57  <the-t-in-rtf> let me check windows and universal
2020-02-27T14:44:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I'd propose retiring those common terms and that transform
2020-02-27T14:44:16  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2020-02-27T14:45:20  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf , I don't have the value right now, let me check
2020-02-27T14:45:50  <the-t-in-rtf> it may not be necessary
2020-02-27T14:46:08  <the-t-in-rtf> if we have two common terms that we can't define the value space of and which aren't used, we can solve the problem by offboarding them

2020-02-27T15:33:27  <jhernandez> it's keyOut , I think - let me check the exact place where gpii-app calls it
2020-02-27T15:34:21  <cindyli> thanks
2020-02-27T15:37:23  <cindyli> jhernandez: the onKeyOut listener in gpii-app is calling reset() - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/menu.js#L60-L62
2020-02-27T15:37:42  *** zaidbj <zaidbj!6725c989@103.37.201.137> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-27T15:38:25  <cindyli> i believe that's why the reset to default is performed at the shut down or logout. the universal logout() doesn't perform reset to default at the keyout
2020-02-27T15:40:00  <cindyli> jhernandez: i'm going to reproduce the issue in my gpii-app VM just to prove the theory. is there a way I can manually hook up the gpii-service with Morphic?
2020-02-27T15:41:09  <cindyli> in this VM, I normally run "cd v:; npm run dev" which only starts Morphic but doesn't perform auto key-in. I guess because gpii-service is not running at all

2020-02-27T15:48:04  <jhernandez> if you really want to run the exact same code, you'd need to use my GPII-4214.GPII-3572 branch
2020-02-27T15:48:44  <jhernandez> and, here's what is happening as far as I can tell, stegru correct me if I'm wrong
2020-02-27T15:49:19  <stegru> I think so, yes
2020-02-27T15:49:33  <jhernandez> gpii-app catches the windowMessage "we're shutting down" , here: https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/blob/GPII-4214.GPII-3572/src/main/app.js#L665-L673

2020-02-27T15:51:01  <stegru> `npm run service-install-dev` will run the service in a way which lets gpii connect to the service (rather than start the instance itself)
2020-02-27T15:51:52  <stegru> also, it's impossible to debug at shutdown via npm, because the shutdown causes npm to die (which kills gpii)
2020-02-27T15:54:29  <jhernandez> yeah, debugging from source code while shutting down  is a nightmare
2020-02-27T15:54:35  <stegru> oh, you'll have to run the `npm run service-XX` commands in %gpii-app/node_modules/gpii-windows

2020-02-27T15:57:06  <cindyli> stegru: so running `npm run service-install-dev` in %gpii-app/node_modules/gpii-windows will start Morphic service without starting Morphic by calling gpii-app.exe?
2020-02-27T15:58:40  <cindyli> how can i hook up the started service with a manually started Morphic via running "cd v:; npm run dev"
2020-02-27T15:59:57  <cindyli> or shall i run `cd v:; npm run dev` first, then running `npm run service-install-dev` will open a pipe to gpii-app?
2020-02-27T16:04:01  <stegru> start the service first, cindyli, then gpii-app might connect to it
2020-02-27T16:04:10  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2020-02-27T16:04:41  <cindyli> stegru: would auto key-in be performed in this sequence?
2020-02-27T16:05:00  <stegru> yes, I think so
2020-02-27T16:06:09  <cindyli> stegru: great. also if I run `Stop-Service "Morphic Service"`, would the service stop the gpii-app and reproduce the shut down issue?
2020-02-27T16:06:53  <stegru> yes, cindyli
2020-02-27T16:07:14  <cindyli> great. thanks, stegru and jhernandez
2020-02-27T16:07:53  <stegru> oh, that command needs to be ran in the gpii-service sub-directory of gpii-windows

2020-02-27T18:48:25  <cindyli> stegru: i place a set of client credential in C:\ProgramData\Morphic Credentials\secret.txt but auto key in still uses the public client credential that doesn't have the privilege to auto create new keys. do you know why?
2020-02-27T19:01:15  <cindyli> probably because i didn't use the installer and don't have c:\Program Files (x86)\Morphic\windows\service.json5

2020-02-27T19:10:02  <cindyli> fixed, i modified gpiiClient.requestHandlers.getClientCredentials() to return a hardcoded client credential

2020-02-27T20:33:33  <gmoss> mohit2399: welcome! If you haven't read it yet, I would suggest going through the GSoC projects page on our Wiki: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-02-27T20:33:33  <gmoss> that page has a wealth of information. If you have any questions about the contents of it or anything else specific, please feel free to ask in here or on the fluid-work mailing list

2020-02-27T20:55:01  <mohit2399> i have read that page
2020-02-27T20:56:29  <mohit2399> i am interested in contributing to the project: Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid
2020-02-27T20:56:51  <mohit2399> can you please guide me in that?
2020-02-27T21:00:14  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf is the mentor for that project. If you leave project-related questions here, he may answer them. If that doesn't happen immediately and you need to go offline, you can check the log files to see what's discussed while you're offline: http://irc-logs.fluidproject.org/%23fluid-work/
2020-02-27T21:00:14  <gmoss> You could also ask your specific questions in the fluid-work mailing list

2020-02-27T21:02:09  <gmoss> cindyli: I was trying to remember what exactly we'd said about this review item on my SJRK-104 PR: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/56#pullrequestreview-362732145
2020-02-27T21:02:51  <gmoss> I'll have to do some investigation to see why it returns "undefined" and not "true"
2020-02-27T21:03:18  <mohit2399> hii
2020-02-27T21:03:28  <gmoss> cindyli: and I don't recall if we'd said anything definitive about what to do for this item
2020-02-27T21:03:51  <mohit2399> can you all give me some tips for getting selected for GSoC?
2020-02-27T21:04:00  <cindyli> gmoss: as i rmv, we said to improve the comment to better explain this test case as "undefined" is specially handled in the framework
2020-02-27T21:04:02  <cindyli> rmb
2020-02-27T21:05:25  <gmoss> cindyli: that sounds correct :) okay, I'll do that. Thanks!
2020-02-27T21:05:35  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
2020-02-27T21:07:01  <gmoss> mohit2399: I would suggest doing some of the things that the-t-in-rtf mentioned in his reply to you on the mailing list. Specifically, familiarizing yourself with Infusion would be a good place to start, as well as exploring the web using only a keyboard for navigation and then writing about your experience
2020-02-27T21:07:51  <mohit2399> where do I send my experience notes??
