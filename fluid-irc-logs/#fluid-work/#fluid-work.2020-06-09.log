2020-06-09T11:03:59  <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, all.

2020-06-09T11:04:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I just updated my windows with upstream/master and now I get errors about a missing module
2020-06-09T11:04:22  <the-t-in-rtf> 03:41:24.624:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot find module 'win-ca/api'
2020-06-09T11:04:22  <the-t-in-rtf> Error: Cannot find module 'win-ca/api'
2020-06-09T11:04:54  <the-t-in-rtf> it seems really unlike to be remotely related to my work in universal, but if anyone has seen that, tips are appreciated.
2020-06-09T11:05:12  <the-t-in-rtf> this is from a CI build of my LSR work.

2020-06-09T11:07:10  <the-t-in-rtf> NM, merge clobbered that dependency
2020-06-09T11:07:21  <dogeman> Is win-ca installed properly?
2020-06-09T11:07:34  <dogeman> ok
2020-06-09T11:08:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I thought someone was fixing the double dependency on rimraf?

2020-06-09T16:10:18  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: just to be clear regarding the laser eye checklist section I'm only planning to cover one or two of the points this week, and hoping others can continue with other points over the coming weeks
2020-06-09T16:23:06  <colinclark> you know what would be cool, Justin_o?
2020-06-09T16:23:35  <colinclark> for the ones like linting, for example, it’d be great to see an example of what your package.json should look like, etc.
2020-06-09T16:23:50  <colinclark> we have different styles for different projects, so there’d be a few examples—but that’s a good thing
2020-06-09T16:25:56  <Justin_o> colinclark: do you mean in terms of what properties are set in the package.json for example types of scripts you could use or do you mean something more specific to linting
2020-06-09T16:51:25  <colinclark> yup, totally Justin_o
