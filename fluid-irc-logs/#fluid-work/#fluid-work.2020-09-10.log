2020-09-10T13:32:45  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I'm running into a need for https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/issues/14 so I'm picking up some work I started on that a while back. I hope to have something in for you to look at today.
2020-09-10T13:48:40  <Uttara> cindyli: good morning. I have a meeting with Vera and David at 11 today, so I be a bit late for the tech check-in
2020-09-10T13:49:36  <cindyli> thanks for letting me know, Uttara
2020-09-10T13:55:25  <cindyli> Uttara: at today's check in, we will continue technical brainstorming and tasking from yesterday. feel free to join or leave depending on whether it's helpful to you. for design updates, feel free to ping us too
2020-09-10T13:57:30  <cindyli> Uttara: for the bagets page, all images are missing alt attribute. could you add them in
2020-09-10T13:57:55  <cindyli> to both the dev and the production wordpress sites
2020-09-10T13:58:30  <Uttara> \
2020-09-10T14:00:08  <cindyli> Uttara: i think i missed your message. I only see a "\" character in your reply
2020-09-10T14:00:42  <Uttara> cindyli: that was a typo. sorry. haha
2020-09-10T14:01:21  <cindyli> Uttara: are you editing badges page now. on both dev and production wordpress sites, this page is locked with "Uttara Ghodke is currently editing" sign
2020-09-10T14:01:43  <Uttara> cindyli: yes I will slose it
2020-09-10T14:02:32  <cindyli> ok. thanks, Uttara. do you add alt texts for all images on badges?
2020-09-10T14:04:28  <Uttara> cindyli: no I was editing it. Its not published is it?
2020-09-10T14:05:32  <Uttara> cindyli: It looks like Vera already published it. Could you exit for a second until I put in the alt text?
2020-09-10T14:05:40  <cindyli> Uttara: by looking at netlify deploy history, both sites have been republished this morning. but looking at wordpress sites, alt texts are still missing
2020-09-10T14:05:44  <cindyli> sure
2020-09-10T14:06:01  <cindyli> i've exited
2020-09-10T14:09:54  <Bosmon> cindyli - it's interesting that the netlify workflow puts us back into 1980s-style VCS affordances : P
2020-09-10T14:10:12  <Bosmon> All the more reason to build our super-duper gittified self-previewing thing .......
2020-09-10T14:11:14  <cindyli> Bosmon: what is 1980s-style VCS? time consuming to deploy?
2020-09-10T14:11:36  <Bosmon> cindyli - being unable to work with a document because it is locked by another user
2020-09-10T14:11:59  <Bosmon> I haven't seen such a thing since the days I used CVS
2020-09-10T14:13:10  <Bosmon> I guess given it has no merge UI or any workflow for it it can't afford even a tiny possibility of a merge conflict
2020-09-10T14:14:07  <cindyli> Bosmon: the locking part is in the WordPress editing which is not part of the netlify. ya, it seems WP doesn't a strong merge feature, which is reasonable for an authoring tool
2020-09-10T14:14:29  <cindyli> the authoring content is more complicated than code in text
2020-09-10T14:14:58  <Bosmon> cindyli - given it is aimed at non-technical people, the content should be less complicated than code in text
2020-09-10T14:16:48  <cindyli> Bosmon: the content could have different types of material, such as video, audio, image, links. also side information like page attributes, excerpt, parent page etc
2020-09-10T14:17:17  <cindyli> i personally feel it's more complicated than plain text
2020-09-10T14:17:59  <Uttara> cindyli: its done. you can take over the wordpress pages. I will close them
2020-09-10T14:18:08  <cindyli> cool. thanks, Uttara
2020-09-10T14:22:00  <cindyli> all images on badges pages have alt attributes now. thanks, Uttara
2020-09-10T14:53:13  <colinclark> cindyli: I think you’re right :)
2020-09-10T14:53:29  <colinclark> in that a content authoring system has to have “semantics” about the content
2020-09-10T14:53:40  <colinclark> including media-specific editors and so on
2020-09-10T14:54:01  <colinclark> whereas, you know, code has been reduced to just text
2020-09-10T14:54:51  <colinclark> that said, I gather that the WordPress editing experience is pretty fraught with issues related to the Gutenberg rewrite
2020-09-10T14:58:13  <cindyli> some other authoring tools such as wiki cannot handle auto merges too
2020-09-10T14:59:23  <cindyli> luckily the diffing and merging tool we'll build for the data monitor only needs to deal with the plain text, for now ;)
2020-09-10T15:02:42  <Bosmon> cindyli - it doesn't deal with plain text at all
2020-09-10T15:02:46  <Bosmon> It will deal with tabular data : P
2020-09-10T15:02:51  <cindyli> right
2020-09-10T15:03:16  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip: guys, tech check in
2020-09-10T15:04:02  <cindyli> Teddy__: check in when you hop on
2020-09-10T15:44:47  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: GPII's Etherpad has been migrated and is now available as the Inclusive Design Etherpad at https://pad.inclusivedesign.ca -- All content from pad.gpii.net has been migrated and users/passwords are the same
2020-09-10T15:45:08  <gtirloni> What's an Etherpad? See https://etherpad.org
2020-09-10T15:46:34  <Bosmon> gtirloni - you are magnificent!
2020-09-10T15:49:39  <gtirloni> lol :)
2020-09-10T15:51:33  <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you know if I have an account for that?
2020-09-10T15:51:55  <gtirloni> Justin_o: you do
2020-09-10T15:52:16  <gtirloni> Justin_o: want me to change the password? the password recovery option doesn't seem to work with this version of etherpad, I need to research that
2020-09-10T15:52:52  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I think I found the password, I'll test it out and let you know if a minute
2020-09-10T15:52:57  <gtirloni> ok
2020-09-10T15:54:46  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I'm in, thanks for porting this over.
2020-09-10T15:54:54  <gtirloni> cool
2020-09-10T15:55:55  <Justin_o> gtirloni: should we link to this somewhere on the wiki? Does that make sense, or should we just link individual pads as needed?
2020-09-10T15:56:20  <Justin_o> That is, is there a way to link to all of the pads as set?
2020-09-10T15:57:59  <gtirloni> Justin_o: etherpad has a set of folder permissions (restricted, public, etc) and pad permissions. I think we need to link to each pad individually
2020-09-10T15:58:08  <gtirloni> I'm not aware of a way to list all the pads
2020-09-10T15:58:15  <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay thanks
2020-09-10T15:58:22  <Justin_o> nice to have access to this
2020-09-10T15:58:22  * gtirloni still getting familiar with etherpad administration
2020-09-10T16:06:01  <gtirloni> looks like you can see all the pads from a public folder if you link to it (I'm assuming a restricted folder will do the same, but require authentication).. for instance, my public folder has one test pad -- https://pad.inclusivedesign.ca/mypads/?/mypads/group/public-b8b26he/view
2020-09-10T16:15:10  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, that's great. Could be helpful for project folders and etc. Do you know if others can add pads to the public folders?
2020-09-10T16:17:03  <gtirloni> there's an option you can check that says 'allow simple users to create pads'.. I think that does it
2020-09-10T16:17:11  <gtirloni> otherwise you can make the folder restricted and invite users to it
2020-09-10T16:17:30  <gtirloni> the so called `administrators` of the folder
2020-09-10T16:27:54  <Justin_o> this is a really unfortunate option name 'allow simple users to create pads'.
2020-09-10T16:28:27  <gtirloni> yeah
2020-09-10T16:31:00  <dogeman_> Hello Justin_o I need to transfer ownership of fluidic 11ty repo to fluid-project
2020-09-10T16:31:19  <dogeman_> but it says I don't have permission to create public repos in the org
2020-09-10T16:31:56  <Justin_o> dogeman_: yes, you'll need to transfer it to me first "jobara" and I'll be able to transfer it to the fluid-project
2020-09-10T16:32:53  <dogeman_> Did you get the request?
2020-09-10T16:34:59  <Justin_o> dogeman_: yes, thanks.. looking at it now
2020-09-10T16:37:24  <Justin_o> dogeman_: all transfered.. thanks so much for all the work on this. https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidic-11ty
2020-09-10T16:39:54  <Justin_o> gmoss, greatislander: ^
2020-09-10T16:43:37  <gmoss> Amazing! Thanks dogeman_ and Justin_o for sorting that out :) can't wait to see what we make with it
2020-09-10T16:45:10  <greatislander> thanks dogeman_ and Justin_o!
2020-09-10T16:47:27  <dogeman_> not a problem Justin_o
2020-09-10T16:47:31  <dogeman_> gmoss
2020-09-10T16:56:08  <greatislander> colinclark cindyli The WordPress post locking thing has been around as long as I've worked with WordPress— ironically I think Gutenberg may allow Google-docs style collaborative editing in the future, for all its other shortcomings. There was a working prototype of that before WordPress 5.0 with Gutenberg was even released. Not sure where it stands at the moment.
2020-09-10T16:57:04  <cindyli> good to know
2020-09-10T17:24:52  <colinclark> cool, greatislander
2020-09-10T17:33:10  <greatislander> https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/23129 colinclark cindyli in progress!
2020-09-10T17:34:51  <cindyli> "the block editor real-time collaborative" COOL!
