2020-06-12T15:45:01  <gmoss> cindyli: is there a particular time that works best for you for pairing? I can definitely keep myself busy in the meantime
2020-06-12T15:46:00  <cindyli> gmoss: anytime works for me
2020-06-12T15:46:58  <gmoss> cindyli: okay, I'm going to wrap up my review of FLUID-6506 PRs, write a couple of emails and then I'll ping you to see if you're still available :)
2020-06-12T15:47:00  <gmoss> thanks!
2020-06-12T15:47:32  <cindyli> sure
2020-06-12T15:48:57  <gtirloni> speaking of pairing, I saw this cartoon yesterday :) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/jgVg08GD/pairing.jpg

2020-06-12T17:04:24  <cindyli> gmoss: i'll ping you in 5 minutes
2020-06-12T17:04:33  <gmoss> cindyli: sounds good
2020-06-12T17:10:11  <gtirloni> gmoss: thanks for the reviews!
2020-06-12T17:10:29  <gmoss> gtirloni: no worries at all :) everything was smooth sailing except the build weirdness for fluidproject
2020-06-12T17:10:45  <gmoss> but it still worked in the end ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-06-12T17:10:51  <gtirloni> yeah, it's weird
2020-06-12T17:14:05  <cindyli> gmoss: i'm ready to pair
2020-06-12T17:14:44  <gmoss> cindyli: awesome :) I'm in the standup room, nobody seems to be using it right now
2020-06-12T17:14:54  <cindyli> coming
2020-06-12T17:14:54  <gmoss> (if anyone needs it, please just let me know)
