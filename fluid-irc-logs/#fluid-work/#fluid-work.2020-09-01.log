2020-09-01T16:24:36  <gmoss> gtirloni: sorry I didn't fully read your last message in the chat just now - were you saying we should have a lightning discussion about migrating Jira to GitHub Issues?
2020-09-01T16:31:05  <gtirloni> gmoss: I meant doing that would impact how we write the commit messages as well
2020-09-01T16:31:50  <gmoss> gtirloni: ah yeah, that's a great point! similar to what greatislander was saying about the keywords that GitHub/GitLab watch for issue management
2020-09-01T17:13:43  <Bosmon3> Hi there cindyli - I was wondering if there was a chance at some point we could start to move the WeCount checkin meetings to a spot earlier in the day?
2020-09-01T17:14:05  <Bosmon3> I can make the current slot sometimes but generally it falls in amongst family dinner
2020-09-01T17:17:56  <cindyli> it's certainly possible, Bosmon3. what time works better for you?
2020-09-01T17:46:32  <Bosmon3> Well, something before 12 EST would be best
2020-09-01T17:46:42  <Bosmon3> Perhaps a 10am or 11am slot?
2020-09-01T17:54:37  <cindyli> Bosmon3: it might be hard for Teddy___. he lives in Vancouver, 12 noon EST is 9AM his time. Teddy___, what do you think?
2020-09-01T18:08:39  <Teddy___> Bosmon3: cindyli I can do 11am but it would overlap with stand up
2020-09-01T18:09:28  <cindyli> michelled: is it ok that the wecount team skips stand up on Monday and Thursday? ;)
2020-09-01T18:11:31  <michelled> yes, of course :)
2020-09-01T18:11:44  <cindyli> great!! thanks
2020-09-01T18:13:21  <cindyli> philip, Uttara: does tech checkin meetings at 11AM work for you
2020-09-01T18:13:26  <cindyli> lisa is not online
2020-09-01T18:13:58  <cindyli> trying skype with her
2020-09-01T18:14:26  <philip> Yes, 11am works for me
