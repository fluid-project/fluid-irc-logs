2020-08-26T01:34:09  <dogeman> hello gmoss, that sounds great. Would jhung be working today?
2020-08-26T01:34:58  <dogeman> Also are we still using jenkins for CI/CD? Because I have workd=flows ready to transfer it to Github actions so we can get rid of jenkins
2020-08-26T01:35:10  <dogeman> gtirloni views?
2020-08-26T01:35:53  <dogeman> Also fluidproject.org doesn't seem to load up properly.
2020-08-26T01:36:23  <dogeman> sorry, just refreshed it and it's working fine
2020-08-26T01:38:20  <dogeman> gtirloni already seems to be using github actions though
2020-08-26T07:47:00  <the-t-i__> We use GitHub Actions.
2020-08-26T07:47:16  <the-t-i__> as do we.
2020-08-26T07:47:24  <the-t-i__> see the check mark next to every commit?
2020-08-26T07:47:29  <the-t-i__> that's the CI build results
2020-08-26T07:47:32  <the-t-i__> I set it up early on.
2020-08-26T07:47:48  <the-t-i__> by the first "We" I mean the community
2020-08-26T07:47:56  <the-t-i__> there are a few things left on Jenkins, but not for long.
2020-08-26T07:56:34  <the-t-i__> sorry, I thought you were talking about a different project.
2020-08-26T07:56:38  <the-t-i__> but the same comment applies
2020-08-26T07:56:50  <the-t-i__> most everything does use GH Actions.
2020-08-26T13:35:39  *** the-t-i__ is now known as the-t-in-rtf
2020-08-26T13:35:57  <the-t-in-rtf> @michelled, do you know whether Justin is on vacation?
2020-08-26T13:36:08  <michelled> yep, he is
2020-08-26T13:36:27  <the-t-in-rtf> when is he back?
2020-08-26T13:36:43  <michelled> I think next week - we often put our vacations on this calendar https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dTR0czNibW5jNmsxNDR1ajJvaDNhaXV1bW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ
2020-08-26T13:37:04  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks for that.
2020-08-26T13:37:14  <michelled> np, I should give you access, one sec
2020-08-26T13:37:18  <the-t-in-rtf> awesome
2020-08-26T13:37:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Next question, is anyone there a backup for him on Chrome Extension stuff?
2020-08-26T13:37:52  <michelled> do you have a gmail the-t-in-rtf or do I use your raising the floor address?
2020-08-26T13:37:58  <the-t-in-rtf> rtf, please
2020-08-26T13:38:13  <the-t-in-rtf> tony@raisingthefloor.org
2020-08-26T13:38:29  <michelled> I think you should be able to add to that calendar now
2020-08-26T13:38:41  <michelled> unfortunately, cindy would be the best backup on that work but she's away too
2020-08-26T13:39:10  <michelled> the-t-in-rtf: maybe Bosmon could help?
2020-08-26T15:33:17  <gmoss> dogeman_: I'm not sure if jhung will be working today, since he's still sick, unfortunately. We're definitely switching to GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and gtirloni has turned off the Jenkins jobs. The plan is for him to add GHA to the site after it's merged into the upstream repo, which has already been done for fluidproject.org
2020-08-26T15:33:17  <gmoss> I have a meeting to join right now, but we can chat after if you still have questions :)
2020-08-26T17:43:34  <dogeman_> gmoss jhung is working today I guess
2020-08-26T17:43:56  <dogeman_> the PR gotmerged.
2020-08-26T17:44:06  <gmoss> dogeman_: yep, looks like it :) congratulations again!
2020-08-26T17:44:13  <gmoss> Thanks jhung
2020-08-26T17:45:15  <dogeman_> I'll be closing the issues i opened earlier during proposal documentation as floe project has got a new design doc.
2020-08-26T18:10:09  <jhung> dogeman_ no problem! Thanks for all your work on both websites.
2020-08-26T18:37:50  <gtirloni> dogeman_ jhung gmoss: floeproject.org is pointing to the new deployments. congrats on the release
2020-08-26T18:38:38  <jhung> Awesome gtirloni, thanks for taking care of that.
2020-08-26T18:40:51  <dogeman_> thanks gtirloni.
2020-08-26T18:41:26  <dogeman_> not a problem jhung. it was an amazing summer working with you and gmoss
2020-08-26T18:54:45  <gmoss> gtirloni: amazing, thank you :)
2020-08-26T18:54:45  <gmoss> dogeman_: likewise, it's been a great experience!
