2019-12-09T16:14:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, I was reading https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6440
2019-12-09T16:15:22  <Justin_o> I see that you pushed a commit to your FLUID-6148 branch related to it, should that work with my prefs framework context awareness?
2019-12-09T16:16:28  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2019-12-09T16:16:47  <Justin_o> Bosmon: nice, the JIRA made it sound like it wasn't going to be something we could do any time soon
2019-12-09T16:19:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: amazingly you managed to get a fluid.fail call on line 666 https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/82ae6339ff0b9f97180906851ec8f1b4f478f5be#diff-50cd32a7983e921376821a0476122713R666
2019-12-09T16:20:21  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf good afternoon! Just wanted to ask you if you would have time tomorrow for that meeting about transforms and validation in the SR

2019-12-09T17:36:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon:I ran into another issue with FLUID-6420 around context awareness. It seems that the options from defaultGradeNames are not merging as expected when the context check fails
2019-12-09T17:37:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, defaultGradeNames is dodgy, in theory you should get an error from that : P
2019-12-09T17:37:12  <Bosmon> But I'm interested in what happened?
2019-12-09T17:37:37  <Justin_o> I don't see the value supplied for it, but I do see the grade name there
2019-12-09T17:38:20  <Bosmon> There's actually a big problem with the idiom of defaultGradeNames in the new idiom - since if a context doesn't match on one cycle, it can't remove the default from future cycles
2019-12-09T17:38:35  <Bosmon> In theory this is the case that should trigger the error message on line 666, so I'm interested if it didn't
2019-12-09T17:38:41  <Bosmon> What did you put in the defaultGradeNames?

2019-12-09T17:41:16  <Justin_o> Bosmon: and here's the grade with the context awareness
2019-12-09T17:41:28  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/3ZxjEztn/
2019-12-09T17:42:02  <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, that should be fine, we don't expect the value of the context to change from cycle to cycle
2019-12-09T17:42:06  <Bosmon> There may be a further bug
2019-12-09T17:42:08  <Bosmon> Can you check it in?
2019-12-09T17:42:44  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I think the contents of your https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/827 don't pass validation once the-t-in-rtf 's validation work is merged in again
2019-12-09T17:42:55  <Bosmon> But unfortunately his validation implementation doesn't produce an intelligible error
2019-12-09T17:43:14  <Bosmon> 17:09:01.478:  Validation error in file 'e:\Source\gits\gpii\node_modules\universal\testData\preferences\caroline.json5':

2019-12-09T17:58:46  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon , yes that's the reason for tomorrow's meeting, that preference set uses transforms as well as we have always been doing, and it was required by the QSS color filter mouse button spec
2019-12-09T17:59:44  <javjarfer[m]> But looks like the validation pulls invalidates all the preference sets using application specific transforms

2019-12-09T20:03:04  <Bosmon> gmoss - other than FLUID-6148, there is now a FLUID-6145 series
2019-12-09T20:03:13  <Bosmon> Which includes all the changes in FLUID-6148, plus immutable options
2019-12-09T20:03:45  <Bosmon> Given that compatibility seems to be looking pretty good, it seems likely that the upcoming framework release will be based on FLUID-6145

2019-12-09T20:11:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I've just pushed up to my FLUID-6420 branch. I've set the context check to false, so you should be able to see that the prefs framework demo fails now because of the template path supplied

2019-12-09T20:12:05  <gmoss> Bosmon: okay thanks! so for my Storytelling Tool development (and the SJRK-255 PR), would you say 3.0.0-dev.20191126T121754Z.6452de06f.FLUID-6145 is currently the best choice?
2019-12-09T20:12:33  <gmoss> I'm running 3.0.0-dev.20191107T164711Z.332e92c33.FLUID-6148 but i'm experiencing options merging issues. Justin_o is going to pair with me to explore this, but i thought I'd let you know
2019-12-09T20:12:41  <Bosmon> gmoss - yes, give it a go
2019-12-09T20:13:23  <Bosmon> I've made some minor updates since then to help Justin_o but it shouldn't affect your work
2019-12-09T20:40:44  <gmoss> Bosmon: Justin_o and I are checking this out, it's a very curious issue. we have a question: given two grades A and B where B is an A (B has A in its gradeNames), does the "nomerge" merge policy mean that the values in A are used or the values in B?
2019-12-09T20:41:03  <gmoss> and how does that differ from "replace"
2019-12-09T20:50:01  <sgithens> Bosmon: Did we recently merge in infusion updates to gpii-universal that include making the options section of a component truly immutable or read only?
2019-12-09T20:51:20  <sgithens> actually, never mind, I think this is a different issue
2019-12-09T20:53:02  <sgithens> I'm trying to figure out why this update I used to be making in some unit tests adjusting filenames in the test data fro the solutions registry isn't working
2019-12-09T20:53:20  <sgithens> the error says it's now read-only

2019-12-09T21:58:31  <Bosmon> gmoss - broadly speaking, "nomerge" should be comparable to "replace" plus "noexpand", but it is an old-fashioned mergePolicy that it is best not to use
2019-12-09T21:58:44  <Bosmon> "replace" is clear in meaning that the values from the least derived grade end up winning
2019-12-09T22:01:13  <Bosmon> gmoss - what's your use case?

2019-12-09T22:10:39  <gmoss> Bosmon: sorry I was afk. I'll put together a couple of links to the relevant lines of source
2019-12-09T22:19:47  <gmoss> Bosmon: the storytelling tool uses gpii.binder to link the DOM to block models in the editor, and there are some tests which previously passed that are no longer working properly. The situation was and is that we have a grade called sjrk.storyTelling.blockUi.editor which has a binder subcomponent. One binding in the `bindings` block is listed for "heading".
2019-12-09T22:19:47  <gmoss> https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blob/b2fb41eec6d7a50a447aabf823b859ae490dd5c9/src/ui/blockUi-editor.js#L30
2019-12-09T22:19:47  <gmoss> A second grade (sjrk.storyTelling.blockUi.editor.textBlockEditor) is an extension of that grade that also specifies a second binding for "textBlockText" in the same `bindings` block. This previously worked without issue, but now it doesn't.
2019-12-09T22:19:47  <gmoss> https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blob/b2fb41eec6d7a50a447aabf823b859ae490dd5c9/src/ui/blockUi-editor-textBlockEditor.js#L33
2019-12-09T22:19:47  <gmoss> When Justin_o and I looked into it, we discovered this line in the definition of gpii.binder that sets the `bindings` block to nomerge: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-binder/blob/88af41231f0ba70311c7f7b09eb07e58564cc619/src/js/binder.js#L156
2019-12-09T22:20:28  <gmoss> Bosmon: the problem is that heading is not appearing in the list of bindings that is finally set up, but we want both values to be present and merged together.
2019-12-09T22:21:12  <gmoss> I'm not sure why `bindings` is set to nomerge, but it's been that way for years. The behaviour we're seeing is also consistent with what I'd expect for "replace"
2019-12-09T22:21:56  <gmoss> Bosmon: I hope I haven't missed anything out of my explanation but please let me know if you'd like any clarification :)
2019-12-09T22:22:20  <gmoss> it's pretty easy to reproduce from my latest SJRK-255 branch, as well
2019-12-09T22:23:52  <Bosmon> gmoss - thanks for the issue, it looks pretty clear
2019-12-09T22:24:04  <Bosmon> I think it looks like something I'll need to talk over with the-t-in-rtf in the morning
2019-12-09T22:24:30  <Bosmon> The nomerge definition in gpii-binder is likely faulty and will need an adjustment plus further test cases
2019-12-09T22:24:31  <gmoss> Bosmon: I figured we would want to involve him as well, since he's the author, but he's not online ;) and our schedules don't line up so well.
2019-12-09T22:24:44  <Bosmon> gmoss - that's fine, this will be enough for us to go on
2019-12-09T22:24:59  <gmoss> Bosmon: I wonder if there are any other projects using gpii.binder that would be affected if the mergePolicy is changed
2019-12-09T22:25:39  <Bosmon> gmoss - I expect sgithens stuff as well - but the fix is really to fix gpii.binder - the mergePolicy is an implementation detail that shouldn't affect usage
2019-12-09T22:25:52  <Bosmon> Your usage of gpii.binder looks pretty clearly one that should be supported : P
2019-12-09T22:26:05  <gmoss> Bosmon: I thought so too haha :)
2019-12-09T22:26:24  <gmoss> Bosmon: but there's nothing in the docs that discusses merging bindings, so it's not clear if this was by design
2019-12-09T22:26:32  <sgithens> hmm
2019-12-09T22:26:51  <Bosmon> Well, the overall goal of Infusion is that merging should do what the users expect : P

2019-12-09T22:28:02  <Bosmon> We've had this issue open for a number of years: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5021
2019-12-09T22:28:50  <Bosmon> I've done little about it since the next framework revision will make a total rewrite of the options merging system and so it didn't seem worth rearranging the deckchairs
2019-12-09T22:30:00  <gmoss> Bosmon: fair enough! The most curious part of this for me is why this ever worked before
2019-12-09T22:30:31  <gmoss> I will wait to see what you and the-t-in-rtf discover :)
2019-12-09T22:30:51  <Bosmon> gmoss - making options immutable involved making a number of bug fixes in the framework where it inadvertently stamped on some of its own data structures and aliased them together
2019-12-09T22:31:10  <Bosmon> In practice immutable options has been as good for uncovering framework bugs as it has been for uncovering user bugs
2019-12-09T22:31:22  <Bosmon> And so one of these aliasing bugs may have been responsible for the previous behaviour
2019-12-09T22:31:31  <gmoss> seems plausible!
2019-12-09T22:32:54  <Bosmon> These days "noexpand" and "replace" are the only two builtin mergePolicies that I trust
2019-12-09T22:33:22  <Bosmon> The code paths for "nomerge" haven't been visited in so long that I'm no longer confident in what it really does
2019-12-09T22:36:30  <Bosmon> In practice, everyday users should never have to interest themselves in mergePolicies, the fact that they are cropping up so often is a symptom of how much strain our 8-yr-old options merging pipeline is under
2019-12-09T22:36:40  <gmoss> Bosmon: Justin_o and I had a hard time finding out where it is "defined", if at all. outside of a check against it in a regex (that was only good for saying "no this isn't the default merge policy") and one other ref to it, there wasn't much to go by
2019-12-09T22:36:48  <Bosmon> To be honest, it's surprising it carries on working at all considering how much the rest of our framework has changed around it : P
2019-12-09T22:36:55  <gmoss> Haha
2019-12-09T22:37:36  <gmoss> It seems that by gluing some of the bottom cards of the house in place, some others are falling over :)
2019-12-09T22:37:41  <Bosmon> gmoss - yes well your regex is as good as mine, in figuring out what "nomerge" actually does : P
2019-12-09T22:37:54  <Bosmon> gmoss - well sadly the very bottom card was put in place in 2009 as an absolutely essential optimisation
2019-12-09T22:38:14  <Bosmon> In the days of CollectionSpace we made the decision that merged component defaults would be merged before expansion and put into a cache
2019-12-09T22:38:35  <Bosmon> Because without this the performance of the framework was totally unacceptable
2019-12-09T22:39:07  <Bosmon> Unfortunately this has created a huge number of irregularities in the way merging happens, because in every more modern bit of framework development, merging has happened before expansion
2019-12-09T22:39:39  <Bosmon> This is the main reason that mergePolicies are constantly popping out of the woodwork everywhere
2019-12-09T22:39:53  <Bosmon> Until we can remove this bottom card from the stack, lots of things aren't going to make the sense they should
2019-12-09T22:40:33  <Bosmon> Sorry, I confused myself, I should have said there, "expansion has happened before merging" : P
2019-12-09T22:41:04  <gmoss> Bosmon: I got what you meant ;) at least some small progress is being made, we'll get there eventually
2019-12-09T22:41:21  <Bosmon> Yes, we might well, who knows : P
2019-12-09T22:41:34  <Bosmon> In practice we need some kind of a working renderer before we can tackle fundamentals like that
2019-12-09T22:41:56  <Bosmon> The next task after this framework release is to make most of the code in the prefs framework go away
2019-12-09T22:43:30  <gmoss> Bosmon: ambitious! it would be pretty valuable though. I've had a lot of trouble wrangling the system as it is currently
2019-12-09T22:53:49  <gmoss> Bosmon: now I just have to figure out what to do about this line :P
2019-12-09T22:53:49  <gmoss> https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blame/b2fb41eec6d7a50a447aabf823b859ae490dd5c9/src/ui/base-page.js#L188
2019-12-09T22:54:08  <gmoss> I think that's the only thing keeping me from a full set of passing browser tests
