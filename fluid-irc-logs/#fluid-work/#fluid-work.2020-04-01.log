2020-04-01T10:28:19  <jhernandez> question, is your fix for the mouse settings to be saved already in universal/master?
2020-04-01T10:33:24  <jhernandez> ok, it was GPII-4351 and so far I see that it has been merged
2020-04-01T10:34:06  <jhernandez> however, the cloud is still rejecting to save the larger mouse pointer setting

2020-04-01T13:42:43  <Justin_o> cindyli: I'm looking at https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/133
2020-04-01T13:42:52  <Justin_o> are the links under the footer sections supposed to be missing?
2020-04-01T13:45:20  <cindyli> Justin_o: do you mean the links for social media icons? Lisa and I talked about that yesterday. social media accounts for wecount project haven't been set up. Lisa suggested to hide that section for now. she said it's ok to have that corner empty temporarily. so, before we merge this pull request, we need to hide that section. sorry, I forgot to leave a comment. will do it now
2020-04-01T13:50:01  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for that.. but I had meant the links under about, tools, inclusion challenges, our data,
2020-04-01T13:50:16  <cindyli> i see :)
2020-04-01T13:51:24  <cindyli> those are secondary nav items for each page, which we don't have right now, Justin_o. this issue will be taken care separately when those information are available
2020-04-01T13:51:29  <Justin_o> cindyli: are those dynamically generated as content is added, or we will just add in another jira?
2020-04-01T13:51:37  <Justin_o> okay thanks
