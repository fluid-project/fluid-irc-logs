2020-10-09T18:07:56  <clown> hey colinclark:  I'm looking for a bit of advice.
2020-10-09T18:08:07  <clown> I could send the confirmation for next week's Preferences Server meeting to the everyone list.
2020-10-09T18:08:10  <colinclark> hiya clown
2020-10-09T18:08:11  <clown> But, maybe the fluid-work list is better?
2020-10-09T18:08:16  <colinclark> yeah, i’d say fluid-work
2020-10-09T18:08:24  <clown> cool, thanks.
2020-10-09T18:08:26  <colinclark> i do want to be circumspect about our relationship to morphic though
2020-10-09T18:08:36  <colinclark> so maybe we should keep the topic and framiing a bit more general
2020-10-09T18:08:50  <colinclark> “shared ways of storing personal preferences’ or something
2020-10-09T18:09:06  <colinclark> rather than specifically “resurrecting the GPII/morphic classic prefereences server”
2020-10-09T18:09:08  <colinclark> if you see what I mean?
2020-10-09T18:09:20  <colinclark> Bosmon might have some guidance in this regard
2020-10-09T18:11:46  <clown> I get that.  But does that mean changing the tone of wiki page?
2020-10-09T18:12:19  <clown> It doesn't specifically say "resurrect", but more of a what can we use/learn from that effort?
2020-10-09T18:15:29  <colinclark> paste me a link?
2020-10-09T18:15:37  <colinclark> i might be a bit slow to respond, i’m in a tricky meeting
2020-10-09T18:15:42  <colinclark> but i will look
2020-10-09T18:15:52  <clown> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Review+of+GPII+Preferences+Service
2020-10-09T18:18:37  <clown> Also, it looks like the standup zoom room is available at that time, so we could use that, colinclark
2020-10-09T18:18:45  <clown> unless there is a better one?
2020-10-09T18:18:47  <clown> (Sorry about the chirping during your meeting).
2020-10-09T18:31:09  <Bosmon> Good review, clown
2020-10-09T18:32:54  <clown> Thanks, Bosmon.
2020-10-09T18:33:15  <clown> Still adding to it.
2020-10-09T18:33:19  <clown> so much to learn…
2020-10-09T18:44:16  <Bosmon> Well, there's only so much to learn from the GPII :)
2020-10-09T18:47:12  <clown> heh
2020-10-09T18:48:21  <colinclark> Yes, this looks great clown
2020-10-09T18:48:22  <colinclark> thank you
2020-10-09T18:48:32  <clown> Title okay, colinclark?
2020-10-09T18:48:37  <colinclark> yes, it’s fine
2020-10-09T18:48:44  <colinclark> I think the framing can just be in the email text itself
2020-10-09T18:48:45  <clown> I could remove the "GPII" from it.
2020-10-09T18:48:59  <clown> All right.  That I have done (the email, that is).
2020-10-09T18:49:06  <colinclark> perfect
2020-10-09T18:49:07  <colinclark> go for it
2020-10-09T18:49:12  <colinclark> and yeah, maybe remove the GPII
2020-10-09T18:49:15  <colinclark> just in case
2020-10-09T18:50:37  <clown> that will change the link, I think.  But that's fine — "update your bookmarks".
2020-10-09T18:52:04  <colinclark> ha yes
2020-10-09T18:52:10  <colinclark> the wiki will redirect
2020-10-09T19:09:31  <Bosmon> In the GPII, we thought of brilliant schemes to solve problems that in practice were largely factitious and functions of the management we had and the partners we had, rather than the users we had
2020-10-09T19:10:32  <Bosmon> Hence the emphasis on the marvellous but probably untimely "ontology manager", and the fact that what the preferences server exposed was a slice of (partially transformed) data directed at a particular solution rather than the entire preference set
2020-10-09T19:12:11  <Bosmon> So yes, there were only ever two ontologies, one of which was never used in practice, and what it dispensed was, pragmatically, almost always the same as a subset of what was stored
2020-10-09T19:13:28  <Bosmon> The key type was always "gpii-key" etc..... All this can be pretty much dispensed with and the thing can just serve a more or less flat set of key-value pairs, although we should retain the ability for values to have deep structure if required
2020-10-09T19:14:48  <Bosmon> What we really want is the OAuth workflow that used to be exposed by the old CBFM grafted on to a pretty straightforward CRUD server dispensing the preferences
2020-10-09T19:22:46  <colinclark> it’ll be nice to just have a good old set of key value pairs :)
2020-10-09T20:51:15  * clown going to call it day soon.  Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!x
2020-10-09T20:52:22  * clown darned typing skills — there is not suppoed to be an 'x' at the end of that.  However, take it anyway you want.
