2020-02-24T04:01:07  <mohit2399> My name is Mohit Kumar Verma. I am currently a second year student at NIT Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh, India pursuing Computer Science and Engineering dual degree B-tech + M-tech.
2020-02-24T04:02:02  <mohit2399> I am interested in one of the project you listed for GSoC -- Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid
2020-02-24T04:02:56  <mohit2399> I would like to know everything about this and would like to help for the same.
2020-02-24T04:03:09  <mohit2399> Thank You

2020-02-24T12:11:43  <Bosmon> Hi javjarfer[m], the-t-in-rtf
2020-02-24T12:12:02  <the-t-in-rtf> howdy.
2020-02-24T12:12:06  <Bosmon> So should javjarfer[m] be able to update the focus pull https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/283 to trunk in order to pick up some validation fixes?
2020-02-24T12:12:06  <javjarfer[m]> Hi Bosmon , good morning
2020-02-24T12:12:07  <javjarfer[m]> (afternoon)
2020-02-24T12:12:13  <Bosmon> Should he expect to get some further failures at this point?
2020-02-24T12:14:06  <the-t-in-rtf> He may if there are mismatched schemas and transforms that he's adding
2020-02-24T12:14:13  <the-t-in-rtf> master adds tests to detect those
2020-02-24T12:14:25  <Bosmon> OK, but the next step is to update, right?
2020-02-24T12:15:05  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, it's a windows pull
2020-02-24T12:15:18  <the-t-in-rtf> there may be expected and test values that need to be updated there as well
2020-02-24T12:16:01  <Bosmon> OK, I see that https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/847 is currently failing
2020-02-24T12:16:27  <Bosmon> But other than this, we're currently on the track of pushing your fixes in universal master into production, right?
2020-02-24T12:16:41  <the-t-in-rtf> As far as I know, yes.
2020-02-24T12:16:53  <the-t-in-rtf> I have tested that work with a dev cloud and morphic client already.
2020-02-24T12:17:01  <the-t-in-rtf> colour vision doesn't work, but it can't
2020-02-24T12:17:03  <the-t-in-rtf> everything else works
2020-02-24T12:17:33  <Bosmon> OK
2020-02-24T12:17:36  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf I was currently updating the universal version of that pull using a reference https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/849/files for schema updating
2020-02-24T12:17:48  <Bosmon> But I'm imagining we haven't pushed a version of the installer featuring colour vision into any pilots?
2020-02-24T12:19:13  <the-t-in-rtf> Javi H. can answer that better, but the button is in 1.3.0 even
2020-02-24T12:19:20  <Bosmon> Oh wow
2020-02-24T12:20:59  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that's why I want it in as soon as we can manage.
2020-02-24T12:21:36  <the-t-in-rtf> it = the colour vision pull
2020-02-24T12:21:56  *** yashjipkate <yashjipkate!~thejedico@118.185.236.183> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2020-02-24T12:22:25  <Bosmon> ok
2020-02-24T12:23:05  <Bosmon> Great, do let us know if you need any help, javjarfer[m]
2020-02-24T12:23:10  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, please
2020-02-24T12:23:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I just finished the fixes for Githens, I have plenty of time to help if you need it, @javjarfer[m]
2020-02-24T12:23:50  <the-t-in-rtf> The build passes locally, just waiting for CI to catch up
2020-02-24T12:24:08  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - but does it look like we will have any chicken and egg problems? Is it likely that we can get a version of the SR into production that matches what the existing clients are trying to save?
2020-02-24T12:24:35  <the-t-in-rtf> FYI this is for another whole class of related issues where the deep structure required for various windows settings handlers wasn't reflected in the schemas.
2020-02-24T12:24:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I test it with what the existing clients are trying to save.
2020-02-24T12:25:00  <the-t-in-rtf> thankfully we got very lucky
2020-02-24T12:25:11  <the-t-in-rtf> in that none of those issues required any data changes
2020-02-24T12:25:23  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. they were trying to pass around a common term whose schema hasn't changed
2020-02-24T12:25:35  <the-t-in-rtf> or "aliases" whose value hasn't changed.
2020-02-24T12:25:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have access to modify the settings of https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension
2020-02-24T12:25:57  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - what did you test? You have a version of the SR that already updates javjarfer[m]'s pull?
2020-02-24T12:25:59  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2020-02-24T12:26:02  <the-t-in-rtf> the changes are on the right hand side of a transform, i.e. the value after the transform from the same values the client is passing
2020-02-24T12:26:06  <Justin_o> Would you be able to disable the GitHub issues from this repo, as they should be tracked in JIRA
2020-02-24T12:26:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2020-02-24T12:26:29  <the-t-in-rtf> no, I tested my changes in my dev cloud with a released client
2020-02-24T12:26:56  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - but your changes already fix the schema for the colour vision solution?
2020-02-24T12:26:57  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, or maybe I don't understand the question
2020-02-24T12:27:05  <the-t-in-rtf> it's not been onboarded.
2020-02-24T12:27:09  <the-t-in-rtf> so no?
2020-02-24T12:27:20  <the-t-in-rtf> that pull would have to pull in from master and check the tests are passing.
2020-02-24T12:27:30  <the-t-in-rtf> merge with master, I mean
2020-02-24T12:27:38  <Bosmon> Well I'm a bit lost, you said that JH has already released an installer which includes buttons for this feature?
2020-02-24T12:27:47  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes
2020-02-24T12:27:57  <the-t-in-rtf> but because the solution didn't exist in master, it gets a pass
2020-02-24T12:28:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I mentioned this to you
2020-02-24T12:28:04  <Bosmon> Oh right
2020-02-24T12:28:10  <Bosmon> nonexistent solutions always pass
2020-02-24T12:28:15  <the-t-in-rtf> our per-solution validation will ignore any solutions it doesn't know about
2020-02-24T12:28:18  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2020-02-24T12:28:20  <the-t-in-rtf> exactly
2020-02-24T12:28:24  <Bosmon> But that's only a feature of the current production cloud, right?
2020-02-24T12:28:30  <Bosmon> Your current master fixes this?
2020-02-24T12:29:36  <the-t-in-rtf> just a moment, looking up something to confirm
2020-02-24T12:30:47  <the-t-in-rtf> what I've added fixes various transforms
2020-02-24T12:31:04  <the-t-in-rtf> the only bug you can actually hit for the lack of the fix is the large mouse pointer setting
2020-02-24T12:31:10  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf thanks! Will ping you in case of finding myself stuck
2020-02-24T12:31:17  <the-t-in-rtf> it does not report an error on a nonexistent solution
2020-02-24T12:31:34  <the-t-in-rtf> we can change that once the colour vision stuff is in
2020-02-24T12:31:44  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - ok, so this means that in theory we could push current master into production and resolve the large mouse pointer setting without introducing any new failures?
2020-02-24T12:31:53  <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise any use of that button puts your settings in a state where they can't be saved
2020-02-24T12:32:05  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's what my testing would suggest
2020-02-24T12:32:40  <Bosmon> And that what is being saved by current clients to the cloud via colour vision is compatible with what can be validated once javjarfer[m] updates universal #847 ?
2020-02-24T12:32:42  <the-t-in-rtf> so the colour vision stuff is a nice to have, but leaving it out leaves us no worse off than we are now
2020-02-24T12:32:48  <Bosmon> ok cool
2020-02-24T12:33:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I need to double-check what the QSS sends for colour vision
2020-02-24T12:33:24  <the-t-in-rtf> just a moment while I check the logs

2020-02-24T12:45:10  <sachin10101998> I had a few queries regarding the migration to hugo for fluid project.
2020-02-24T12:45:17  <sachin10101998> What's the major goal behind this project? Are we trying to migrate to Hugo so as to achieve faster build times? What are the major issues with present format or Docpad that we have to rectify which Hugo can solve?
2020-02-24T12:45:32  <sachin10101998> 2) While migrating to Hugo, do we need a complete new design and look for the website or do we have to stick to the present design/UI?
2020-02-24T12:45:48  <sachin10101998> 3) Currently, floeproject is not using any static site generator and fluidproject uses docpad. Are they both being hosted on gh-pages or do we use third party services like AWS or Azure for hosting them?
2020-02-24T12:45:56  <sachin10101998> 4) Is there a restriction on using Hugo only as the alternate static site generator? Or can we discuss using Jekyll as an alternative to Docpad?
2020-02-24T12:46:28  <sachin10101998> It would be really helful if someone could answer these.

2020-02-24T12:46:51  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon I have noticed that the values of the enum have been changed here https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/849/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2L4922 from string to integers, but this is incorrect, because the type of the key in the registry is in fact "REG_SZ" as can be seen here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4833, so the values need to be
2020-02-24T12:46:51  <javjarfer[m]> strings
2020-02-24T12:50:38  <javjarfer[m]> also, cursors values have been altered, https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/849/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2L5501, those new values wont work with the current windows cursors

2020-02-24T12:54:35  <the-t-in-rtf> what do you mean, "those new values"?
2020-02-24T12:54:48  <the-t-in-rtf> the values were always a potential output from the transform, that hasn't changed
2020-02-24T12:55:08  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if you had somehow managed to use the nonexistent cursor colour, you would have hit the value that's there.
2020-02-24T12:55:19  <the-t-in-rtf> anwyay, if they're not up to date, obviously they need to be fixed
2020-02-24T12:55:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess most times we were hitting "" or something?
2020-02-24T12:56:04  <the-t-in-rtf> Also, if the string-ness of the values matter, we can revert that, they just have to match
2020-02-24T12:56:53  <the-t-in-rtf> There wasn't an actual schema for "Crosshair" before, I had to create that
2020-02-24T12:56:57  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: upperBound value output here has changed https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/849/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2L5506
2020-02-24T12:57:20  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the output has changed, but note that these were always valid values for the cursor in the previous registry: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/657f7c344f167f182e49e66f72719105a11eb3c0/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5321
2020-02-24T12:57:31  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the transforms were producing values out of the destination setting's range
2020-02-24T12:57:50  <the-t-in-rtf> they weren't in fact valid
2020-02-24T12:57:55  <the-t-in-rtf> as the new tests revealed
2020-02-24T12:58:00  <Bosmon> Right
2020-02-24T12:59:01  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, sounds like we have some follow up work to fix some of this stuff, particularly the crosshairs and cursors.
2020-02-24T12:59:14  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: mismatching between schema values and transform outputs doesn't mean that transforms output were the invalid values, I don't know where the values for the schemas were introduced, but I think that the values of the transforms were the correct ones

2020-02-24T13:00:09  <the-t-in-rtf> how could they have been?
2020-02-24T13:00:17  <the-t-in-rtf> they referred to a common term that didn't exist, for starters.
2020-02-24T13:00:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess the noMatch blocks were valid?
2020-02-24T13:00:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, that transform could only ever have resulted in ""
2020-02-24T13:00:58  <the-t-in-rtf> no matter the range
2020-02-24T13:01:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess my pull also put that back in.
2020-02-24T13:02:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, can we maybe meet for a bit?
2020-02-24T13:04:34  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf:  this pull was the one that introduced the new transforms https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/636/files
2020-02-24T13:04:42  <javjarfer[m]> I'm checking it
2020-02-24T13:06:08  <Saad> Hey @Justin_c! I want to work  on Port UIO+ Chrome Extension to Firefox and Safari. I have couple of questions. Question 1: Do I have to use only Infusion whiling building the extension for Firefox and Safari? Question 2: Can I also use libraries like React.js?
2020-02-24T13:06:30  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I see what you mean about the cursor names then.
2020-02-24T13:10:02  <the-t-in-rtf> IMO the correct way to fix this is to better define the schema for those settings.  Is there a list of cursors somewhere?
2020-02-24T13:10:14  <Justin_o> Saad: The short answer is, use Infusion. The preference framework that it is built from is made in Infusion. So it's the easiest approach to benefit from the shared code. Also we want, as much as possible, to build all the extensions from the same code base. We don't want to maintain multiple instances of it.
2020-02-24T13:11:05  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: those values were taking by manually changing the setting in Windows and checking the changes in the registry
2020-02-24T13:12:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess the diff is as good a mapping of one to the other as any
2020-02-24T13:12:54  <javjarfer[m]> and the testing, as with all this similar setting was by using a test prefset and seeing the the system actually changed with the desired cursor settings
2020-02-24T13:13:28  <the-t-in-rtf> right, that's the only way you can test anything not on the QSS at the moment
2020-02-24T13:13:45  <Saad> Justing: Okay. I want to get started on it right away, but I don't see any GitHub repo for it. So, should I include one or two working feature of the extension while writing my proposal?

2020-02-24T13:20:20  <the-t-in-rtf> so, I'll write up two quick tickets, one to fix the cursor values and one to fix the string/number stuff

2020-02-24T15:20:06  <the-t-in-rtf> Sure.  I think you're getting a good sense of some of the issues, for example, not being able to see where you are.
2020-02-24T15:21:39  <the-t-in-rtf> You mentioned defining additional keys for features, it's an interesting point, but raises two questions.  1) how do you teach people what the controls are? 2) how do you know you're not getting the way for keys they need for something like a screen reader or other helper.
2020-02-24T15:21:47  <the-t-in-rtf> Check this out: https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/

2020-02-24T15:30:34  <dmahajan980> For the first question, I think we can use a catalogue or some sort of documentation that describes the various key shortcuts and their functionalities, which the user can access for reference. I didn't think of the second question before. This would surely create some issues and bugs in navigation/functionality. I'll go through the article you just sent, for getting more of this concept.

2020-02-24T15:40:16  <the-t-in-rtf> @dmahajan980, the other thing to remember is that in this project you're designing something that can be used with any site, i.e. you're deciding which "keys" the person will be able to hit.

2020-02-24T15:47:25  <dmahajan980> @the-t-in-rtf I got your point! We need to set the controls that are common and the user can easily familiarise with. At the same time, making the controls work on every website.
2020-02-24T15:47:25  <dmahajan980> I'll ensure that the controls/keystrokes in the list are fully functional and supported.
2020-02-24T15:47:58  <dmahajan980> Thanks for the insights!
2020-02-24T15:48:19  <the-t-in-rtf> you're welcome.
2020-02-24T15:49:22  <dmahajan980> For now, I'll go through the list you sent, again. But how shall I proceed after that?

2020-02-24T18:21:58  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf , Bosmon, hi good afternoon, both pulls https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/847 and https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/830 are now updated with new settings definitions and passing CI, windows version for GPII-4152 failed CI twice due to known issues and a unrelated issue regarding SPISettingsHandler, I told stegru about spi issue, and he isn't aware of it too, so I'm going to see if we have a
2020-02-24T18:21:59  <javjarfer[m]> problem with spi tomorrow

2020-02-24T18:34:45  <jhernandez> and then you can get back to test using the login/logout plain http request approach :P

2020-02-24T20:49:43  <Justin_o> greatislander, Teddy__: just thinking as we were leaving the meeting, about the Thursday check in. Are you going to use the code sharing feature in VS code? If so, what do I need to get setup to use that? I don't use VS Code, but do have it installed.
2020-02-24T20:50:21  <greatislander> Justin_o it's called VS Code Live Share. If you install the Live Share extension and then sign in with your GitHub account you should be good to go.
2020-02-24T20:50:33  <greatislander> Teddy__ It would be good to see if you can get that working again, actually
2020-02-24T20:50:56  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks, I'll take a look at that
2020-02-24T20:52:09  <Teddy__> Okay, i'll have it ready
2020-02-24T20:52:35  <greatislander> awesome
2020-02-24T20:53:09  <greatislander> Teddy__ Justin_o if you want to test the connection before our Thursday afternoon meeting that would probably be a good idea just to make sure we aren't wasting time getting it configured
2020-02-24T20:53:18  <greatislander> Let's touch base earlier that day perhaps
2020-02-24T20:53:44  <Justin_o> greatislander: sure, sounds good
2020-02-24T21:00:13  <Teddy__> great idea
