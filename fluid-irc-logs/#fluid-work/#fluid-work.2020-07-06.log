2020-07-06T14:22:16  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o , I will be setting up Github Actions for CI as I migrate repos
2020-07-06T14:22:25  <the-t-in-rtf> it would help reduce the cross talk if we could take them off of Jenkins
2020-07-06T14:22:26  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/77
2020-07-06T14:22:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume you can help with that?
2020-07-06T14:23:31  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: if you want to disable them from Jenkins, gtirloni is the best to talk with about that. Assuming it is being done in our Jenkins instance.
2020-07-06T14:23:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I think others can merge pulls, Antranig has helped in the past
2020-07-06T14:24:03  <the-t-in-rtf> that's why it's a repo, so that multiple people can take ownership and submit changes
2020-07-06T14:24:21  <the-t-in-rtf> But @gtirloni, if you're about, I don't care who merges things.
2020-07-06T14:24:24  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I don't have access to the GPII org I think
2020-07-06T14:24:36  <gtirloni> can't merge :(
2020-07-06T14:25:16  <the-t-in-rtf> I do have access to that org but also can't merge.
2020-07-06T14:25:18  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I also don't have commit access to GPII. But if it's just as simple as merging that PR perhaps clown or cindyli would be able to do that
2020-07-06T14:25:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I hope it's that simple
2020-07-06T14:25:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it's literally just removing a few tasks for the migrated projects.
2020-07-06T14:26:01  <clown> Good morning Justin_o, the-t-in-rtf.  *catching up*
2020-07-06T14:26:27  <gtirloni> Justin_o the-t-in-rtf: yep, if nothing has changed since the last time I looked at it, it's just merging... jenkins will pick up the changes and update the jobs
2020-07-06T14:27:06  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's my understanding as well
2020-07-06T14:27:07  <clown> as I recall the-t-in-rtf and I got the same privilge vis-a-vis the GPII repos, recently.
2020-07-06T14:27:20  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but it doesn't help
2020-07-06T14:27:33  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we'd have to find someone who does have access to tell us who else has access
2020-07-06T14:28:21  <clown> that was sort of my point â€” if you (the-t-in-rtf) don't have the privilege, then I likely don't either.  But, I'm willing to try.
2020-07-06T14:29:09  <the-t-in-rtf> I hate to keep dragging very busy people in, but can @alanharnum or @colinclark  at least confirm who can merge things other than @Bosmon?
2020-07-06T14:30:15  <the-t-in-rtf> AHA
2020-07-06T14:30:26  <the-t-in-rtf> just looking through closed pulls
2020-07-06T14:30:30  <the-t-in-rtf> Alfredo can merge it apparently
2020-07-06T14:31:42  <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: I do in fact appear to have access to merge that repo, assuming it's the PR at https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/77
2020-07-06T14:32:36  <alanharnum> https://media1.giphy.com/media/kqGNZmuPC2BZS/giphy.gif
2020-07-06T14:32:36  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2020-07-06T14:32:43  <the-t-in-rtf> and great.
2020-07-06T14:34:37  <alanharnum> I can go ahead and merge - it looks like all the GPII admins have access, as well as the "Infrastructure and Ops" group: Avtar, Alfredo, sgithens, myself, and the bot
2020-07-06T14:34:46  <alanharnum> I will add Gio to that group as well
2020-07-06T14:34:53  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, great idea.
2020-07-06T14:35:10  <alanharnum> ah, actually Admin only has read access
2020-07-06T14:35:32  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, otherwise I think I'd have it, I think I bugged someone for that on Friday
2020-07-06T14:36:11  <the-t-in-rtf> CI and infrastructure?
2020-07-06T14:36:33  <the-t-in-rtf> it's exactly the people you said.
2020-07-06T14:36:38  <the-t-in-rtf> and it makes sense.
2020-07-06T14:37:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't need to be in that group, but it does make sense for Gio to get added.
2020-07-06T14:37:26  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, thanks for the merge.
2020-07-06T14:37:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm glad I didn't have to keep tapping people whose job it isn't all the way back to Avtar
2020-07-06T14:37:44  <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: I've merged the pull; I am looking now to see if I have sufficient access to add Gio. That might only be doable by Alfredo.
2020-07-06T14:38:22  <gtirloni> thanks
2020-07-06T14:39:26  <alanharnum> I don't have the power - it will need to be someone with Owner or Team Maintainer permissions for the GPII org, according to: https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team
2020-07-06T14:39:45  <gtirloni> no worries, thanks for checking
2020-07-06T14:40:32  <alanharnum> retracting that "UNLIMITED POWER" gif i posted earlier :(
2020-07-06T14:42:03  <gtirloni> haha
2020-07-06T14:45:25  <Bosmon> I can add Gio to something?
2020-07-06T14:45:28  <Bosmon> What does he need to be added to
2020-07-06T16:22:24  <dogeman> gmoss jhung colinclark I updated the PR by removing the news articles which I found unnecessary and changed all HTML code from post articles to markdown to pass the linter. I made the recommended changes that gmoss suggested in the comments. Please check.
2020-07-06T17:14:47  <gtirloni> Bosmon: I think add to GPII/ci-service so I could help with merging PR's in that repo
2020-07-06T18:47:33  *** christopher is now known as Guest96744
2020-07-06T19:23:23  <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: could someone with admin access add me to some group and/or give me admin access so I can add/remove GitHub Actions secrets in the inclusive-design org?
2020-07-06T19:33:31  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I'll look into it
2020-07-06T19:34:46  <gtirloni> Justin_o: thanks :D
2020-07-06T19:51:10  <Justin_o> gtirloni: are you trying to add an org wide secret or a repository secret?
2020-07-06T20:14:47  <gtirloni> org wide secret..  almost all repos will need access to Docker Hub to publish new docker images, access to the deployment server, etc.. So instead of adding to every repo, I thought it would be better to add at the org level
2020-07-06T20:15:30  <Justin_o> gtirloni: you should have access now
2020-07-06T20:15:57  <gtirloni> thanks, I can see it. much appreciated!
2020-07-06T20:16:40  <Justin_o> gtirloni: colinclark and I are planning to look over the permissions and teams for fluid-project and inclusive-design orgs at some point. So things might get switched up at that point, but please remind us of this requirement  if something stops working for you.
2020-07-06T20:19:24  <gtirloni> will do, thanks
