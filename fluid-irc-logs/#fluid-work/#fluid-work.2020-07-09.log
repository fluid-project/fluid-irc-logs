2020-07-09T05:19:15  <gtirloni> Justin_o gmoss: thanks for helping with the PRs!
2020-07-09T05:19:46  <gtirloni> gmoss: I plan to containerize Spifind as well. I think I hit some problems because the project doesn't have a clear build step but I'll look into it again
2020-07-09T05:21:13  <gtirloni> gmoss: scratch that, I see it has a build step.. I don't remember what the issue was but I'll look into it
2020-07-09T05:22:46  <gmoss> gtirloni: good luck! hopefully it's an easy one
2020-07-09T05:23:02  <gtirloni> gmoss: sorry, didn't mean to wake you up!
2020-07-09T05:23:18  <gmoss> gtirloni: I was still awake, not to worry haha
2020-07-09T05:23:26  <gtirloni> ah ok *heavy breathing* :)

2020-07-09T12:33:44  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @gmoss and any other gpii-pouchdb users.
2020-07-09T12:33:45  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-pouchdb/pull/26
2020-07-09T12:34:04  <the-t-in-rtf> Turns out I was able to fix the node@12 issues with a few simple version bumps.
2020-07-09T12:38:37  <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: that's great!
2020-07-09T12:39:02  <the-t-in-rtf> If I'd known it were that easy I'd have taken care of it ages ago, sorry for the wait.
2020-07-09T12:39:27  <the-t-in-rtf> As far as I know it's like 2/3 find and replace calls to migrate.
2020-07-09T12:39:33  <the-t-in-rtf> there are no code changes.
2020-07-09T12:45:23  <the-t-in-rtf> gpii.pouchdb => fluid.pouchdb
2020-07-09T12:45:40  <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-pouchdb => fluid-pouchdb (for fluid.module.resolvePath and the package name)
2020-07-09T12:45:54  <the-t-in-rtf> and /GPII/ => /fluid-project/ for any docs links
2020-07-09T13:48:43  *** christopher is now known as Guest91631
2020-07-09T14:19:01  <cindyli> Justin_o: when you have time, can we have a quick call to talk about https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/999? just so i can share my screen
2020-07-09T14:19:12  <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, I'm free now
2020-07-09T14:19:41  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. let's meet in the standup room?
2020-07-09T14:20:54  <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, on my way
2020-07-09T16:57:29  <the-t-in_> @gtirloni, you set up GitHub Actions for kettle?
2020-07-09T16:57:36  <the-t-in_> I ask because it's set to test against node@8
2020-07-09T16:57:37  <the-t-in_> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/64/checks?check_run_id=854890521
2020-07-09T16:57:55  <the-t-in_> probably that needs to be either 12 or a matrix of 10 and 12
2020-07-09T16:57:59  <the-t-in_> 8 is no longer supported
2020-07-09T16:58:28  <the-t-in_> the tests fail specifically because of running on node@8 from what I can see
2020-07-09T16:58:30  <gtirloni> I did yeah.. hmm does it work with 10/12?
2020-07-09T16:58:33  <the-t-in_> yup
2020-07-09T16:58:42  <the-t-in_> the underlying packages are tested in a matrix with both
2020-07-09T16:58:47  <the-t-in_> i.e. the linting stuff is failing.
2020-07-09T16:59:22  <gtirloni> I can submit a PR for 10/12 and see how that goes
2020-07-09T16:59:49  <the-t-in_> that'd be good, I suspect it was just set to test with node@8 at some point and that it wasn't intentional to only test with that
2020-07-09T16:59:58  <gtirloni> yeah, I think so too
2020-07-09T17:00:20  <the-t-in_> Anyway, you can see the library (linting) that's failing has 10/12 tests here
2020-07-09T17:00:21  <the-t-in_> https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all
2020-07-09T17:00:34  <the-t-in_> and other packages that use it for linting also work on 10/12
2020-07-09T17:03:37  <gtirloni> awesome
2020-07-09T17:04:41  <gtirloni> oh, it's our version of leveldown probably
2020-07-09T17:04:42  <gtirloni> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/65/checks?check_run_id=854921789
2020-07-09T17:08:31  <Uttara> Justin_o: Hi! Do you have some time to show me later how to upload documents on wiki? Let me know what time works for you.
2020-07-09T17:10:20  <gtirloni> the-t-in_: I'll try different pouchdb version and see if it works. It probably will
2020-07-09T17:29:11  <the-t-in_> @gtirloni, I'm specifically trying to fix that.
2020-07-09T17:29:23  <the-t-in_> i.e. the current gpii-pouchdb only works on 10
2020-07-09T17:29:36  <the-t-in_> the new version of fluid-pouchdb will add support for 12
2020-07-09T17:29:39  <gtirloni> cool, I think you did it :) --- see: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/65
2020-07-09T17:29:44  <the-t-in_> yes
2020-07-09T17:29:58  <the-t-in_> awwwwwesome
2020-07-09T17:30:00  <the-t-in_> that's great
2020-07-09T17:36:02  <gtirloni> the-t-in_: if you want to add this line to your PR, I can close mine :) -- https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/65/commits/6ac264cc6d311c2b74e2690f56c005b4c7ad05ab#diff-e9f950f17198d3d5e3122a44230a09b9R20
2020-07-09T17:39:28  <the-t-in_> Done
2020-07-09T17:39:28  <the-t-in_> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/64/commits/199585066edfe3bfe99dfeaf578e925a153f4488
2020-07-09T17:39:33  <the-t-in_> Thanks, man.
2020-07-09T17:39:41  <the-t-in_> Great to work with you even for a few minutes, it's been too long.
2020-07-09T17:40:06  <the-t-in_> I may chat with you re: docker containers, which are required for the fluid-couchdb-test-harness stuff, probably early next week.
2020-07-09T17:40:29  <the-t-in_> but getting kettle sorted is definitely enough for today.
2020-07-09T17:44:06  <Justin_o> Uttara: sorry, just saw your message now. I can meet with you now if you like
2020-07-09T17:46:05  <Uttara> Sure on the tech check-in channel?
2020-07-09T17:46:21  <Uttara> Justin_o
2020-07-09T17:46:42  <Justin_o> I might be in another meeting at that time, but I can try to join then
2020-07-09T17:46:44  <Justin_o> Uttara: ^
2020-07-09T17:47:21  <Uttara> Justin_o: No sorry I meant can we meet right now using that channel
2020-07-09T17:47:23  <gtirloni> the-t-in_: awesome, great to work with you too :D let me know when you want to talk containers
2020-07-09T17:51:47  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: we might want to use gpis-express-user  ( https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express-user ) in the storytelling tool. Do you have plans to migrate it? Also, can it be easily used with kettle?
2020-07-09T18:00:43  <Justin_o> Uttara: sorry, misunderstood that.. okay, I can meet in that room now
2020-07-09T18:01:05  <Uttara> ok
2020-07-09T18:01:11  <Uttara> be right there
2020-07-09T19:06:26  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I hadn't planned to, but at this point nearly all of its prerequisites are onboard, so I can probably manage it.
2020-07-09T19:06:44  <the-t-in-rtf> I just need to work out the fluid-couchdb-test-harness stuff to make that possible.
2020-07-09T19:08:29  <parzival197> Hey guys! I was wondering if FLUID is still open for GSOC ?
2020-07-09T19:09:50  <Justin_o> parzival197: Sorry, GSoC already started, but not sure exactly what you are asking.
2020-07-09T19:10:38  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks :) do you know if it will work with Kettle?
2020-07-09T19:10:42  <parzival197> Is FLUID open for GSOC Projects next year ?
2020-07-09T19:10:54  <the-t-in-rtf> It won't currently.
2020-07-09T19:10:58  <the-t-in-rtf> but it's certainly possible
2020-07-09T19:11:12  <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe I did that already, just a sec
2020-07-09T19:11:47  <Justin_o> parzival197: it might be, but that we won't know till next year. It will depend on our time and if we are accepted as a GSoC org
2020-07-09T19:12:33  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I work on a lot of libraries
2020-07-09T19:12:42  <the-t-in-rtf> seems like I did the conversion for gpii-json-schema
2020-07-09T19:13:09  <the-t-in-rtf> I can certainly talk someone through doing it for gpii-express-user, even if  I'm not sure I can do the conversion myself
2020-07-09T19:13:54  <parzival197> @the-t-in-rtf, The game controller as a navigation is an impressive initaitive!
2020-07-09T19:14:00  <the-t-in-rtf> so, here's an example of a kettle-facing grade that uses a common base grade: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-json-schema/blob/master/src/js/server/kettleValidation.js
2020-07-09T19:14:33  <the-t-in-rtf> someone would need to make a parallel set of grades for all the endpoints, but it's certainly possible
2020-07-09T19:15:43  <parzival197> I would love to contribute to that project, Any way how ?
2020-07-09T19:18:23  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: good to know it's possible. I can help with that work, but will definitely need to helping understanding what is needed to be done.
2020-07-09T19:18:41  <the-t-in-rtf> I am always up for that kind of pairing
2020-07-09T19:19:00  <Justin_o> awesome thanks :)
2020-07-09T19:19:52  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2020-07-09T19:20:33  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I'm not exactly sure when I'll be starting on that, but possibly sometime next week. Would you like to port it over to the fluid-project org first
2020-07-09T19:20:34  <Justin_o> ?
2020-07-09T19:23:18  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I'll need to grab an admin on both orgs for that, so a week is good
2020-07-09T19:23:25  <the-t-in-rtf> not that it takes long, but people are busy
2020-07-09T19:23:56  <the-t-in-rtf> the actual updates are almost comically easy, I typically do a repo in a half hour at this point
2020-07-09T19:23:57  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yep, I understand that
2020-07-09T19:24:30  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: are you changing all the namespaces too?
2020-07-09T19:24:35  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2020-07-09T19:24:47  <the-t-in-rtf> the conversion is about three find and replace operations
2020-07-09T19:24:58  <the-t-in-rtf> one for the namespace, one for the project name, another for any docs refs
2020-07-09T19:25:11  <the-t-in-rtf> and then cleaning up any linting errors
2020-07-09T19:25:29  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: when you re-publish these, are you bumping to another major release.. I'm guessing those changes will all be api breaking.. but then they would have to also pull in a new package so not sure it matters
2020-07-09T19:25:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I haven't been doing that per se
2020-07-09T19:26:18  <the-t-in-rtf> I think it's a good point when I start putting in deprecation notices
2020-07-09T19:26:27  <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps I can add conversion notes there
2020-07-09T19:27:01  <the-t-in-rtf> like when package A says they are deprecated and you should use package B
2020-07-09T19:27:16  <the-t-in-rtf> the versions are comparable, but it's not the same as an update to the same package
2020-07-09T19:29:24  <Justin_o> Yes, that's true.. and I like the idea of the conversion notes too.
