2019-04-16T11:17:08  <Bosmon> Hi there javjarfer!
2019-04-16T11:29:44  <javjarfer> Hi there Bosmon! So, I was going to ask you about the same issue you have just commented, jhernandez is guiding me to right direction
2019-04-16T11:31:29  <Bosmon> javjarfer - the committing the binary files?
2019-04-16T11:33:31  <javjarfer> Bosmon, oh, no, the other one, the brightness mock tests
2019-04-16T11:34:11  <javjarfer> also, yes, I'm going to remove the binary, that pull was done yesterday in a rush and didn't verify all the files inside the .vs directory
2019-04-16T11:34:20  <Bosmon> javjarfer - cool, no worries

2019-04-16T12:19:38  <javjarfer> Bosmon, sorry, do you see something faulty in my use of fluid.defaults here? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/7fef6eaaf021b295c479632bfe0addc3a3809904/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L547

2019-04-16T12:25:00  <Bosmon> javjarfer - looks fine to me
2019-04-16T12:26:10  <javjarfer> Bosmon, still don't know from where the fail reflected in CI comes, I have added a payload to the "windows-dynamicDeviceReporter-testSpec.js" with no success
2019-04-16T12:27:16  <Bosmon> javjarfer - you can't reproduce the failure locally?
2019-04-16T12:30:55  <javjarfer> Bosmon, yes, I can, what I can't do is make it work xD
2019-04-16T12:31:00  <Bosmon> javjarfer - ok well that's a start
2019-04-16T12:31:12  <Bosmon> Have you checked what happens at the time the defaults are registered at this line? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/7fef6eaaf021b295c479632bfe0addc3a3809904/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L499
2019-04-16T12:33:04  <javjarfer> Bosmon, haven't done that
2019-04-16T12:33:38  <Bosmon> Is it possible that the tests are executing against a mock device registry for the wrong platform?
2019-04-16T12:38:40  <javjarfer> Bosmon, what I can see, is that, that line is only executed once, and when it's "key" holds "gpii.deviceReporter.registryKeyExists" and "mock" just holds the mockFunc "registryKeyExists"
2019-04-16T12:46:22  <Bosmon> javjarfer - that's what you'd expect on the first test at least
2019-04-16T12:46:38  <Bosmon> I see you have properly added the wmi mock registration in your test definition here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/7fef6eaaf021b295c479632bfe0addc3a3809904/tests/platform/windows/windows-dynamicDeviceReporter-testSpec.js#L213
2019-04-16T12:46:44  <Bosmon> What happens if you comment out all the tests but this one?
2019-04-16T12:50:29  <jhernandez> Bosmon: I think I spotted what was going on with javjarfer's deviceReporter problem
2019-04-16T12:51:13  <jhernandez> the dynamic device reporter, when called, goes over the solutions in the solutions registry and checks every isInstalled block
2019-04-16T12:52:18  <Bosmon> jhernandez - ok, I see - and so unless we have mounted at least one mock reporter of each type, it explodes?
2019-04-16T12:52:30  <jhernandez> so, when the first testDef is called, there's no mock for wmiSettingSupported and that's why we can't resolve that mock, because it's not there
2019-04-16T12:52:32  <jhernandez> yes
2019-04-16T12:52:40  <Bosmon> OK, this is a fault of just the same kind we had in the settingsHandlers mocks
2019-04-16T12:52:50  <Bosmon> That we were coding against a universe so small that there was just one of everything : P
2019-04-16T12:52:57  <jhernandez> blame on me, I implemented that
2019-04-16T12:53:03  <Bosmon> Really, I thought it was me ....
2019-04-16T12:53:25  <jhernandez> Bosmon: I think it does the same with settings handler, which could be you
2019-04-16T12:53:29  <jhernandez> :P
2019-04-16T12:53:37  <Bosmon> Yeah ok
2019-04-16T12:53:50  <Bosmon> So let's just fix the bug in the logic here and move on : P
2019-04-16T12:54:03  <jhernandez> yes, I implemented the dynamic device reporter thing in the same way settings handler mocks worked
