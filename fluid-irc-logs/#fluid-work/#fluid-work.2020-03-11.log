2020-03-11T10:28:07  <obate> Hi @gmoss  question: I'm I expected to clone the infusion documentation page on GitHub? Or would it be best if I just create a repo and then make pull request using that particular repo?
2020-03-11T10:30:24  <sachin10101998> obate you are supposed to fork it
2020-03-11T10:33:41  <sachin10101998> Justin_o gmoss : A correction. fluid-project.github.io/fluidproject.org still redirects to fluidproject.org
2020-03-11T10:34:15  <sachin10101998> So I guess, the site is being hosted through master branch which is really strange since gh-pages is not readily compatible with Docpad.
2020-03-11T10:34:45  <obate> Alright sachin10101998...Thanks

2020-03-11T11:12:31  <sachin10101998> Justin_o , since you deleted the gh-pages branch, there's no use of docpad-ghpages plugin which was pushing the out folder to gh-pages branch for hosting it.
2020-03-11T11:19:36  <sachin10101998> Justin_o moreover the floeproject is not hosted using gh-pages as fluid-project.github.io/floeproject.org gives 404. Therefore I removed the CNAME file and sent a PR for the same
2020-03-11T11:20:13  <sachin10101998> Let me know what is the source branch in both fluidproject and floepoject in gh-pages settings.

2020-03-11T12:01:27  <Arthur_ox> the-t-in-rtf hi, is there a preference on whether the game controller project should be a Chrome extension or an Electron app?
2020-03-11T12:02:34  <the-t-in-rtf> No, that's part of the project.
2020-03-11T12:02:43  <the-t-in-rtf> It might even be some other solution.
2020-03-11T12:02:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Those were identified because they are already used within the wider community for other projects.
2020-03-11T12:03:28  <the-t-in-rtf> So during the first phase of the project, potential solutions would be identified and evaluated
2020-03-11T12:03:29  <Arthur_ox> Okay thanks!
2020-03-11T12:05:54  <the-t-in-rtf> but those are good examples of things that work across platform, and that use the same language (Javascript) that Infusion itself is written in.
2020-03-11T12:06:12  <the-t-in-rtf> part of the evaluation would be, how much does it extend the range of technologies we support
2020-03-11T12:06:30  <the-t-in-rtf> so something in another language would be less ideal than something that also uses Javascript

2020-03-11T14:55:30  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: I think what we can try to do is just remove the use of that url in docpad.coffee completely. We should switch to using relative urls instead. I'm thinking the first step would be try to replace all of the references to @site.url with the correct relative path
2020-03-11T14:57:57  <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: do you know what time the APCP meeting is today?

2020-03-11T14:58:39  <sachin10101998> Justin_o what exactly would the correct relative path be?

2020-03-11T15:03:16  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: okay, I was going to say, you might be able to just remove it @site.url part. I think the urls are already at the correct relative paths.
2020-03-11T15:03:32  <sachin10101998> true
2020-03-11T15:03:45  <sachin10101998> they are already at homepage.
2020-03-11T15:03:50  <obate> Hi everyone! jhung Justin_o I just made my first PR to the Infusion docs Repo. Please kindly review my work and share me feedback. Thank you!
2020-03-11T15:04:09  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: if could you also fix the README when you make this fix. The parts about the url and the deployment
2020-03-11T15:04:22  <clown> Justin_o:  1pm EDT == 12PM EST (right?)
2020-03-11T15:04:36  <sachin10101998> I'd still check if there is @site.url which is not at correct path and then make the requisite changes
2020-03-11T15:04:44  <Justin_o> obate: hello. Thanks, I will look when I have a chance
2020-03-11T15:04:47  <dev-shubham1> Justin_o: can I have some issues that I can fix regarding the uio+ chrome extension ?
2020-03-11T15:04:50  <sachin10101998> sure. I'll keep the README in mind

2020-03-11T15:06:43  <Justin_o> dev-shubham1: there isn't any requirement to fix any issues at the moment. It's a good idea to make sure you can get it running and working, understand what it's doing, and to think about how to address porting to other browsers. For the latter, you should be thinking about what issues may arise, what we may need to do to address those issues.
