2019-02-21T09:29:50  <the-t-in-rtf> So, no blame here, but this is exactly the kind of thing the validation of the SR will help us catch: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L10107
2019-02-21T09:29:57  <the-t-in-rtf> the default is not one of the allowed values
2019-02-21T09:30:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I found it because of those checks, which I'm working on
2019-02-21T09:30:56  <the-t-in-rtf> you don't need to fix it, I'm fixing it as part of my validation pull.
2019-02-21T09:31:19  <the-t-in-rtf> but I thought I'd point it out, as soon this kind of stuff will be ringing alarm bells in tests
2019-02-21T09:38:10  <the-t-in-rtf> This will also not be allowed: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6246
2019-02-21T09:38:19  <the-t-in-rtf> that doesn't exist in flat.json5
2019-02-21T09:39:37  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if you mention a capability or a transform, the common term actually has to exist
2019-02-21T09:42:02  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, an actual question!
2019-02-21T09:42:22  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru or @javjarfer[m], this setting is missing the required liveness setting: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L9129
2019-02-21T09:42:49  <the-t-in-rtf> as is the one for brightness: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L9065
2019-02-21T09:47:54  <the-t-in-rtf> Those are just two examples, I'm also catching plenty of goofs I made in my own onboarding efforts
2019-02-21T09:50:22  <the-t-in-rtf> Same question about liveness here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L8775
2019-02-21T09:55:33  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, you'll find out when the checks are merged, but type: "enum" is nonsense
2019-02-21T09:55:48  <the-t-in-rtf> you can use a type with and enum (but you shouldn't)
2019-02-21T09:55:52  <the-t-in-rtf> and there is no "enum" type
2019-02-21T10:19:16  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, don't worry about the liveness, I was able to find that from a previous commit that the merge clobberred.
2019-02-21T10:19:22  <the-t-in-rtf> clobbered

2019-02-21T10:30:29  <javjarfer[m]> hi there the-t-in-rtf , yes, it doesn't surprise me to find that kind of errors in SR, you know, it's hard to verify anything by bare eye.
2019-02-21T10:30:50  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, even for me
2019-02-21T10:30:55  <the-t-in-rtf> computers are very good at these kinds of checks
2019-02-21T10:30:58  <the-t-in-rtf> people, less so
2019-02-21T10:31:16  <javjarfer[m]> Once the validation is in place, we can have an issue just to clean the entire SR making use of it
2019-02-21T10:31:21  <the-t-in-rtf> well
2019-02-21T10:31:26  <javjarfer[m]> I can have that ticket
2019-02-21T10:31:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I have to clean it up front or my tests won't pass
2019-02-21T10:31:44  <the-t-in-rtf> so you'll only encounter it when working with  your own new data.
2019-02-21T10:31:58  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "I have to clean it up front or m"> okay, that's a good reason for doing it
2019-02-21T10:32:31  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "so you'll only encounter it when"> great, because It will help me greatly with ZoomText and R&W
2019-02-21T10:33:02  <javjarfer[m]> we will be much more sure that these big pulls doesn't contains typos in the settings

2019-02-21T11:01:35  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: Bosmon morning
2019-02-21T11:02:51  <jhernandez> I'm wondering, now that we abolished pouchdb ... how do we expect to run the acceptance tests on Windoez?
2019-02-21T11:22:10  <Danail_Dido> Hey guys, we are talking about the Adjust Mouse menu with jhernandez now. Most of the new settings are coming along nicely, but we have a bit of a trouble with the Easier Double Click toggle.
2019-02-21T11:22:48  <Bosmon> jhernandez - the same way we run the integration tests in universal....
2019-02-21T11:23:03  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - sure - and also, do you have time later today to chat about the mouse settings pull?
2019-02-21T11:23:35  <jhernandez> Bosmon: with couchdb? via docker? via vagrant?
2019-02-21T11:23:50  <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes
2019-02-21T11:24:04  <Danail_Dido> As I can see it in the implemetation of the new mouse settings we have a setting that we can use (its basically the delay between the clicks), but the type of the setting itself will accept values between 500 and 5000 (I presume ms).
2019-02-21T11:24:50  <Danail_Dido> Which I will test using a stepper, just to be sure its working properly, but by design we have a toggle there, and I can't see a way to make the toggle to send anything other that true/false (1/0).
2019-02-21T11:25:56  <Bosmon> Danail_Dido - sounds reasonable - we can bring up the design issue at the next Monday's meeting
2019-02-21T11:26:21  <Danail_Dido> Bosmon, sure we can arrange a meeting this afternoon to talk about the PR, not a problem. I will write to you when I'm back from lunch.
2019-02-21T11:26:39  <Bosmon> But the mismatch in general is part of the same raft of issues we are facing across the design, where the value scale and granularity of the SR entry doesn't agree with the one specified by UX
2019-02-21T11:26:46  <Danail_Dido> OK, so meanwhile I can try to implement it as a stepper, just to be sure its working, right?
2019-02-21T11:31:27  <jhernandez> yeah, I guess that at least, we must ensure that it works - we'll figure out with UX next Monday
2019-02-21T11:31:37  <jhernandez> Bosmon: back to the acceptance tests
2019-02-21T11:32:45  <jhernandez> then .... we need something in place in our windows vm to run a couchdb instance
2019-02-21T11:33:18  <jhernandez> I mean, at this point, windows can't use universal/master
2019-02-21T11:33:31  <jhernandez> well, it can, acceptance tests won't run
2019-02-21T11:34:22  <Bosmon> Which we should try to design a reasonably regular solution for, encoded in your "settings.json" file
2019-02-21T11:34:39  <Bosmon> Which, btw, we should try to move out of the testData folder
2019-02-21T11:34:52  <Bosmon> (These last two addressed to Danail_Dido)
2019-02-21T11:35:54  <jhernandez> Bosmon: the-t-in-rtf see https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/804/consoleFull
2019-02-21T11:36:06  <jhernandez> {"isError":true,"message":"Error when retrieving preferences: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:25984 while executing HTTP GET on url http://localhost:25984/gpii/_design/views/_view/findPrefsSafeByGpiiKey?key=%22os_win7%22&include_docs=true while executing HTTP GET on url http://localhost:8081/preferences/os_win7?merge=%merge"}
2019-02-21T11:36:34  <jhernandez> naturally, it fails, there's no couchdb instance running there
2019-02-21T11:42:11  <Bosmon> jhernandez - not really so natural, since as far as I can see, the default "runner" is the Couch one - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/RunTestDefs.js#L151
2019-02-21T11:42:17  <Bosmon> But something must have got out of step somehow
2019-02-21T11:42:49  <jhernandez> ??
2019-02-21T11:43:53  <jhernandez> well, according to https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-couchdb-test-harness/tree/GPII-3531#requirements
2019-02-21T11:44:15  <jhernandez> you need either docker or vagrant to run the tests on couchdb
2019-02-21T11:44:26  <jhernandez> which is not something we have in our windows vm
2019-02-21T11:44:30  <Bosmon> !!!
2019-02-21T11:44:38  <Bosmon> Right, I see
2019-02-21T11:45:31  <jhernandez> I'm not sure to what extent having any of these in our vm is "reasonable"
2019-02-21T11:46:03  <jhernandez> well, in fact, running vagrant inside a vagrant box ...
2019-02-21T11:46:08  <jhernandez> not a good idea IMO
2019-02-21T11:46:42  <jhernandez> docker .... a bit too much to run a few tests?
2019-02-21T11:46:42  <Bosmon> No, the plan was to use Docker
2019-02-21T11:46:51  <Bosmon> jhernandez - get with the 20th century : P
2019-02-21T11:46:55  <jhernandez> heh
2019-02-21T11:47:04  <jhernandez> yes yes
2019-02-21T11:47:50  <jhernandez> well, in advance to that, I've tried installing docker with chocolatey on my vm
2019-02-21T11:48:22  <jhernandez> and so far, couldn't make the acceptance tests to work
2019-02-21T11:48:28  <Bosmon> ok
2019-02-21T11:48:32  <Bosmon> Well it's a good start at least
2019-02-21T11:48:46  <Bosmon> And we should get our Windows vagrant box updated asap
2019-02-21T11:50:29  <jhernandez> yeah, there's docker-desktop choco pkg, but it's a 500Mb download, then the setup, you have to logout/login in order for the membership of the docker GUID to be applied to your user ... but couldn't get the tests to work after all
2019-02-21T11:50:54  <Bosmon> membership of the docker GUID to be applied to your user!!
2019-02-21T11:50:59  <jhernandez> yeah
2019-02-21T11:51:33  <jhernandez> when you install docker, a new group is created and your user must belong to that "exclusive" group :P
2019-02-21T11:52:33  <jhernandez> let's see if the-t-in-rtf has any other thoughts on this
2019-02-21T11:53:00  <Bosmon> jhernandez - so I wonder if there is any evidence in the logs that commands like these try to run - https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-couchdb-test-harness/blob/GPII-3531/src/js/dockerWorker.js#L123
2019-02-21T11:55:07  <jhernandez> do you mean, something like this https://pastebin.com/y8Q01PDk ?
2019-02-21T11:55:25  <Bosmon> Yeah, exactly like that :)
2019-02-21T11:56:16  <Bosmon> What happens if you try running that command from the shell?
2019-02-21T11:56:39  <jhernandez> hold a second, have to restart docker
2019-02-21T11:59:00  <jhernandez> docker ps -a shows "nothing"
2019-02-21T12:00:13  <jhernandez> going over  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-couchdb-test-harness/tree/GPII-3531 to see if I can make something work on the vm
2019-02-21T12:11:12  <jhernandez> well, I can pull the "hello-world" docker image
2019-02-21T12:11:23  <jhernandez> but not couch
2019-02-21T12:15:00  <jhernandez> okay, had to enable the "experimental" support
2019-02-21T12:16:00  <jhernandez> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48066994/docker-no-matching-manifest-for-windows-amd64-in-the-manifest-list-entries
2019-02-21T12:17:11  <jhernandez> C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker.exe: Error response from daemon: failed to start service utility VM (createreadwrite): CreateComputeSystem 871b8afd35e74a23ab237280e020228c13363aac7ff1bb53ef79e1dd06486efc_svm: No hypervisor is present on this system.
2019-02-21T12:17:21  <Bosmon> wow
2019-02-21T12:19:11  <Bosmon> I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this
2019-02-21T12:19:46  <jhernandez> yeah, from the very beginning I didn't want to sound that way
2019-02-21T12:19:55  <jhernandez> but yeah, I've got a bad feeling too
2019-02-21T12:20:01  <jhernandez> :P
2019-02-21T12:20:38  <javjarfer[m]> looks like nested virtualization in Hyper-V isn't supported for 3 parties https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization
2019-02-21T12:21:35  <jhernandez> maybe, we should just install couchdb in the vm and make couchdb-test-harness to handle such situation?
2019-02-21T12:21:56  <Bosmon> Yes, that's another good option
2019-02-21T12:22:11  <Bosmon> In practice with the env variable enabled it doesn't actually care where the CouchDB is
2019-02-21T12:22:23  <Bosmon> This is the way I run it, since docker isn't supported on Windows 7 anyway
2019-02-21T12:22:46  * jhernandez nods
2019-02-21T12:23:13  <Bosmon> Although in practice I have CouchDB in another vagrant box, we already stripped out the code in the gpii-couchdb-test-harness that cares exactly why something is listening on port 5984
2019-02-21T12:25:22  <Bosmon> Or 25984 .....
2019-02-21T12:26:00  <Bosmon> Is there a workable CouchDB choclatey package?
2019-02-21T12:28:16  <jhernandez> not that I know
2019-02-21T12:28:58  <jhernandez> the only one I can find is https://chocolatey.org/packages/couchdb
2019-02-21T12:29:18  <jhernandez> which is from 2012
2019-02-21T12:36:35  <jhernandez> the official couchdb installer is only a 40Mb file that can be pulled and installed via command line - then we would need to configure it in a way that works for us
2019-02-21T12:36:48  <stegru> if you're trying to get docker working in a Windows vm, it's not going to happen
2019-02-21T12:37:07  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, that was my feeling
2019-02-21T12:37:41  <stegru> on windows, it uses virtualisation
2019-02-21T12:39:53  <the-t-in-rtf> It's preinstalled on a linux vm, which is how I got it working for Antranig.
2019-02-21T12:39:56  <the-t-in-rtf> (vagrant vm)
2019-02-21T12:40:34  <stegru> yes, in Linux docker isn't virtualisation
2019-02-21T12:41:13  <the-t-in-rtf> yes.  The "worker" concept in the new package could certainly be made to work with any arbitrary external Couch instance.
2019-02-21T12:41:24  <the-t-in-rtf> the gpii-couchdb-test-harness package, I mean
2019-02-21T12:41:47  <the-t-in-rtf> so if you can get couch installed by any means, that's also an option
2019-02-21T12:42:09  <the-t-in-rtf> so, are we talking about testing universal in a windows vm, or where is this coming up?
2019-02-21T12:42:41  <stegru> I wonder if it works on the linux subsystem for windows
2019-02-21T12:43:43  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I probably can't fix it just now, but if we write it up today, I should be able to whip out an "external couch" test harness that just checks to see that couch is up and provisions it.
2019-02-21T12:44:05  <the-t-in-rtf> nothing in my db provisioning is docker or vagrant specific, it's all straight Couch REST API calls.
2019-02-21T12:45:44  <the-t-in-rtf> so I'd just add another environment variable for the third option
2019-02-21T12:46:06  <the-t-in-rtf> If that sounds reasonable, I do have enough time to write up the issue
2019-02-21T12:46:30  <the-t-in-rtf> just not quite enough to fix it today
2019-02-21T12:49:04  <the-t-in-rtf> but that assumes someone can install couch on a Windows VM
2019-02-21T12:50:52  <the-t-in-rtf> so, do we have a pattern for downloading and running an MSI as part of our provisioning?
2019-02-21T12:54:49  <stegru> we'd use chocolatey, it's on their repository
2019-02-21T12:55:37  <the-t-in-rtf> uh
2019-02-21T12:55:40  <the-t-in-rtf> we can't use it
2019-02-21T12:55:43  <the-t-in-rtf> that one is so ancient
2019-02-21T12:55:46  <the-t-in-rtf> 1.2!
2019-02-21T12:56:10  <the-t-in-rtf> they're up to 2.3.0
2019-02-21T12:56:18  <stegru> download and use the "msiexec /i" command
2019-02-21T12:56:25  <the-t-in-rtf> yup, that's what I was hoping
2019-02-21T12:56:45  <the-t-in-rtf> so someone would need to update the provisioning bits in the windows repo to install it
2019-02-21T12:57:10  <the-t-in-rtf> with luck it's provisioned sanely by default, otherwise we'd need to issue a few REST calls to do that
2019-02-21T12:57:40  <the-t-in-rtf> or I guess since I'd have to test it I'd have to provide an example of doing so in the gpii-couchdb-test-harness package and that could be reused
2019-02-21T12:59:00  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I'll take a first stab at writing it up and paste a link before I go
2019-02-21T13:01:32  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, pulling the msi and installing it on the commandline shouldn't be a problem
2019-02-21T13:02:58  <jhernandez> not sure about the rest of the steps we need in order to have it "ready" for couchdb-test-harness to deal with it
2019-02-21T13:05:22  <the-t-in-rtf> leave that to me
2019-02-21T13:05:57  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: sure
2019-02-21T13:06:53  <jhernandez> let me know what you end up with, I guess that everything should be doable at the provisioning stage
2019-02-21T13:08:58  <jhernandez> I'm only worried a bit if we end up finding out that we need to update our "packer recipe" and generate a new vm
2019-02-21T13:10:52  <the-t-in-rtf> if someone has a windows VM running, just try installing Couch, it should be obvious if we can use it
2019-02-21T13:10:54  <Bosmon> I assume all we need to do is install Couch and adjust the port number ....
2019-02-21T13:10:57  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-02-21T13:11:00  <the-t-in-rtf> I would also assume that
2019-02-21T13:12:01  <Bosmon> It's a much smaller download than Docker is : P
2019-02-21T13:12:40  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3741
2019-02-21T13:13:42  <the-t-in-rtf> So, I don't have quite enough time to wait for a window VM to provision, if someone has one, here's what we want to download and install:
2019-02-21T13:13:43  <the-t-in-rtf> http://archive.apache.org/dist/couchdb/binary/win/
2019-02-21T13:15:05  <the-t-in-rtf> we're using the latest couchdb docker image
2019-02-21T13:15:31  <the-t-in-rtf> which looks like 2.3.0, the actual latest CouchDB
2019-02-21T13:16:36  <the-t-in-rtf> it'd be good to see if we can manage it without any intervention, which would allow us to avoid updating the image itself.

2019-02-21T14:48:36  <cindyli> can you switch to this branch if it's still linked to the old learning-to-learn branch?
2019-02-21T14:49:21  <cindyli> i pushed some changes into the new stories-floe-production branch but didn't triggered the re-deployment of the production website.

2019-02-21T15:00:56  <cindyli> 1. every a few seconds, this log line pops up - Kettle server getDispatcher found no matching handlers, continuing
2019-02-21T15:03:12  <cindyli> 2. couchdb is supposed to serve data at the port 25984, but couch is not started because: i) accessing the weblink http://localhost:25984/_utils gives "unable to connect"; ii) all http requests to views are rejected
2019-02-21T15:04:13  <cindyli> btw, regarding 1, the every 20 seconds environment change report on timestamp doesn't show up, which might be related
2019-02-21T15:05:13  <cindyli> docker is running on my machine
2019-02-21T15:05:18  <cindyli> did i do something wrong?

2019-02-21T15:09:53  <Bosmon> We actually need to get Couch installed on the machine : P

2019-02-21T15:18:26  <cindyli> i will
2019-02-21T15:18:29  <Bosmon> cindyli - not really the future plan, more the current plan : P
2019-02-21T15:18:35  <cindyli> great
2019-02-21T15:19:28  <Bosmon> If you can't get the harness to automatically start up docker, you could try the route of manually provisioning a vagrant box and then using the env variable

2019-02-21T17:02:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I am free before and after that.
2019-02-21T17:02:42  <cindyli> I killed that container, restarted GPII locally, nothing changed on the "ps …" list
