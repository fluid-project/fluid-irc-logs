2020-06-11T13:22:38  <Justin_o> gtirloni, michelled: regarding the docker PR for Infusion, should I review that now, or do we want to sort out the build site conversation on list first?
2020-06-11T13:23:22  <michelled> I don't have an opinion
2020-06-11T13:42:58  *** christopher is now known as Guest46582
2020-06-11T13:50:19  <gtirloni> Justin_o: I think that Dockerfile will be useful even without the build site, so if you could review it now that'd be great :)
2020-06-11T13:51:35  <colinclark> I’m with gtirloni :)
2020-06-11T13:51:58  <colinclark> The other discussion I think is probably going to be clearer as we start to work on the new Infusion site
2020-06-11T13:52:07  <colinclark> we definitely need a gallery of our work
2020-06-11T13:52:48  <colinclark> some demos can be “archived” as a static website, but definitely want to be able to point people to examples of what we’ve built or are in the midst of building
2020-06-11T13:52:51  <Justin_o> gtirloni: I left a review comment there already actually.. and agree that the docker image would even be useful for someone trying out our code locally
2020-06-11T13:53:20  <colinclark> and gtirloni, sorry about the state of build for Chart Authoring...
2020-06-11T13:53:36  <colinclark> I’m in the midst of slowly untangling it all, but I don’t get a ton of time to code these days
2020-06-11T13:53:39  <colinclark> but I’ll look at your PR
2020-06-11T13:53:54  <gtirloni> thanks :D I had some fun mixing and matching dependencies yesterday
2020-06-11T13:54:06  <colinclark> yeah, it really sucks
2020-06-11T13:54:27  <colinclark> philip and I tangled with this situation a month or two back, when he was working on the Nexus demos
2020-06-11T13:54:36  <colinclark> It all stems from an ancient version of Flocking
2020-06-11T13:54:56  <gtirloni> yeah, I had some issues building the midi dependency with flocking 0.2.0 but 2.0 worked fine
2020-06-11T13:54:56  <colinclark> which had, at the time, dependence on various native Node.js modules
2020-06-11T13:55:03  <colinclark> good
2020-06-11T13:55:22  <colinclark> i ditched Node.js support in Flocking back a couple of years ago
2020-06-11T13:55:59  <colinclark> I’m just reviewing a usability test for “Morphic Personal,” which is the new product based on “Morphic Lite”
2020-06-11T13:56:11  <colinclark> The summary from the usability tester was:
2020-06-11T13:56:15  <colinclark> “No one thought it looked like something they would need.”
2020-06-11T13:57:55  <gtirloni> lol
2020-06-11T15:00:15  <Justin_o> gtirloni: have we changed how fluidproject.org is deployed?
2020-06-11T15:00:47  <gtirloni> not that I know of, it's here: https://ci.incd.ca/view/Websites/job/website-fluidproject.org/
2020-06-11T15:00:48  <Justin_o> or rather is there anything I need to do other than merge your PR, to have it deployed
2020-06-11T15:01:32  <gtirloni> it seems to have deployed ok, I can see the code
2020-06-11T15:02:06  <gtirloni> thanks for mergin!
2020-06-11T15:02:09  <gtirloni> *merging
2020-06-11T15:02:13  <Justin_o> np, thanks for adding
2020-06-11T15:02:51  <Justin_o> gtirloni: is there value/need to add tracking to our infusion demos.. I think I saw a PR come for the build site too, but we probably also direct link into many of those demos and etc.
2020-06-11T15:03:24  <Justin_o> although it does also seem odd to add tracking for the demos into the infusion repo
2020-06-11T15:03:51  <gtirloni> yeah, feels odd. I think the tracking code in the build site will let us know at least where people are clicking w.r.t to the demos they choose to run
2020-06-11T15:04:22  <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay, thanks

2020-06-11T15:43:04  <Bosmon> Do let me know when it is starting : P
2020-06-11T15:43:18  <michelled1> I'd guess in about 15 min

2020-06-11T15:54:38  <gtirloni> ahhh ok, got it
2020-06-11T15:54:39  <gtirloni> :)

2020-06-11T18:34:18  <Justin_o> cindyli, Teddy___: for Lighthouse performance testing what do you usually test against.
2020-06-11T18:34:29  <Justin_o> a local running instance, the dev site, etc.
2020-06-11T18:37:21  <cindyli> Justin_o: i usually look at all 4 scores lighthouse reports
2020-06-11T18:37:54  <cindyli> performance, seo, accessibility, best practices
2020-06-11T18:38:07  <Justin_o> cindyli:  I ran npm run start and tested against what that served and the performance was terrible, but I'm vaguely remembering now that it is a known issue
2020-06-11T18:38:33  <Justin_o> cindyli: anyways, I'm looking at https://github.com/inclusive-design/wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/issues/267
2020-06-11T18:39:15  <Justin_o> cindyli: here's an example https://storage.googleapis.com/lighthouse-infrastructure.appspot.com/reports/1591898970607-30386.report.html#performance
2020-06-11T18:39:35  <Justin_o> that uses the static assets after doing a npm run build
2020-06-11T18:40:04  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. the first run on the build from "npm run start" is usually bad. it's better to test with the static site built from running "npm run build"
2020-06-11T18:40:11  <cindyli> oh, i see
2020-06-11T18:41:04  <Justin_o> yah, I was using "npm run start" locally to try to compare.. some of the drop might be related to the server used by Lighthouse to serve the static assets, but not sure

2020-06-11T18:54:32  <Teddy___> Justin_o: I first disable all chrome extension/plugins then use `npm run build` command and perform the testing in incognito mode
2020-06-11T18:54:58  <Teddy___> sometimes chrome extensions interfere with the results
2020-06-11T19:04:44  <Justin_o> Teddy___: thanks

2020-06-11T20:20:21  <gtirloni> I'm really glad we're moving away from docpad.. I can't build a single docpad repository today! grrr..

2020-06-11T20:39:45  <Justin_o> gtirloni: :( for fluid project we pinned the version of docpad that is used in the package.json file
2020-06-11T20:39:51  <Justin_o> if I'm not mistaken
2020-06-11T20:40:18  <Justin_o> eventually that'll stop working with new versions of node though, which may have already happened.
2020-06-11T20:40:58  <gtirloni> yep, that's one of the problems. other repos don't have docpad pinned, or there's no indication which node was used, etc.. I'm trying a few things but the combination of node+docpad+docpad-plugins is hard to find
2020-06-11T20:41:28  <Justin_o> :(
