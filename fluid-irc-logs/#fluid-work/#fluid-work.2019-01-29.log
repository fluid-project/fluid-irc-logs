2019-01-29T11:53:50  <jhernandez> hey there stegru
2019-01-29T11:54:15  <stegru> hi jhernandez
2019-01-29T11:55:11  <jhernandez> been testing the problems with highContrast and I'm getting the same problems in a fresh vm
2019-01-29T11:55:16  <jhernandez> :/
2019-01-29T11:55:33  <stegru> ok
2019-01-29T11:55:58  <stegru> what is the problem?
2019-01-29T11:56:15  <jhernandez> stegru: you can test it by pulling my gpii-app/demo-ATIA-2019 branch
2019-01-29T11:56:22  <stegru> ok
2019-01-29T11:56:39  <jhernandez> the problem is that we can't change the highContrast theme anymore
2019-01-29T11:58:28  <jhernandez> initially I thought that it was a consequence of me doing nasty things in the registry, killing morphic, testing the "reset to STD at startup", etc
2019-01-29T11:59:05  <jhernandez> but today I've started from a fresh vm and I hit the same problem
2019-01-29T11:59:11  <jhernandez> :/
2019-01-29T12:00:43  <jhernandez> stegru: I just pushed an update to my branch, just in case you want to give it a try
2019-01-29T12:04:20  <stegru> yes, same for me (old vm)
2019-01-29T12:06:32  <jhernandez> I'm wondering if a windows update could be behind this - the vm installed the KB4480966 update right after been created

2019-01-29T12:17:36  <stegru> oh.. it DOES work for me, on an old vm - i'll get a new one while i eat something
2019-01-29T12:17:38  <stegru> jhernandez
2019-01-29T12:18:00  <jhernandez> stegru: sure
2019-01-29T12:18:09  <jhernandez> I'm uninstalling the update
2019-01-29T12:18:24  <jhernandez> let's see if it helps
2019-01-29T12:41:19  <jhernandez> no luck
2019-01-29T12:41:21  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-01-29T12:47:52  <jhernandez> stegru: okay, looks like the fix in the iniFile is guilty for that

2019-01-29T14:05:15  <javjarfer[m]> yes, looks like the code of the high-contrast calls the ini parsing without specifying encoding, as stegru suggested, we should updated the doc to make it optional

2019-01-29T14:25:56  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: okay, testing the fix and then following with what jhernandez prefers
2019-01-29T14:26:06  <jhernandez> hey
2019-01-29T14:26:49  <stegru> hi
2019-01-29T14:27:05  <jhernandez> reading this now and following links

2019-01-29T14:38:52  <jhernandez> okay
2019-01-29T14:39:43  <jhernandez> I think we are good to go with stegru's recommendation only
2019-01-29T14:40:04  <stegru> what's that?
2019-01-29T14:40:09  <jhernandez> (options && options.encoding)
2019-01-29T14:40:14  <stegru> oh, yes
2019-01-29T14:40:30  <jhernandez> I am going to test now, but I assume it should be enough
2019-01-29T14:40:46  <stegru> for me it was
2019-01-29T14:44:54  <jhernandez> in relation to doing the same with the general purpose readFile function in the settingsHandlerUtils and updating the doc, doesn't look that we need it at this moment
