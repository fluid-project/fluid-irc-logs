2019-11-19T16:20:40  <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - so I realised we had a bit of a false dawn with FLUID-6426
2019-11-19T16:20:59  *** clown <clown!~clown@205.211.168.102> has joined #fluid-work
2019-11-19T16:21:04  <Bosmon> I hadn't realised that your fix for the composite panel selector modification was applied to trunk, where we didn't have a test failure in any case, rather than the FLUID-6426 branch itself
2019-11-19T16:21:16  <Bosmon> So I found I had a "satisfying" number of further test failures to fix up after that ....
2019-11-19T16:21:30  <Bosmon> I've actually got my branch to a state where it passes fully, but now there are a few things to clear up
2019-11-19T16:21:40  <Bosmon> In one failing test I ran into something quite peculiar
2019-11-19T16:21:41  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactorTests.js#L220
2019-11-19T16:21:45  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you mean fluid-6148?
2019-11-19T16:21:55  <Justin_o> or there is another fluid-6426 branch
2019-11-19T16:21:55  <Bosmon> Justin_o no, FLUID-6426 which is the "immutable options" branch
2019-11-19T16:22:09  <Bosmon> There is a further branch since I wasn't confident we could deliver all the work at the same time
2019-11-19T16:22:14  <Bosmon> Although now I think that we probably can
2019-11-19T16:22:22  <Bosmon> I hadn't issued a pull yet since it was failing
2019-11-19T16:22:35  <Bosmon> Although I guess I may as well
2019-11-19T16:22:48  <Bosmon> Anyway, so there is something a bit interesting in the Syllabification Enactor tests here
2019-11-19T16:23:22  <Bosmon> It seems like you were trying hard to escape the CSS class selectors, but there is this odd feature of JavaScript escapes where \. is simply always equivalent to .
2019-11-19T16:23:32  <Bosmon> Or indeed for any character other than one of the explicit escape sequences
2019-11-19T16:23:46  <Bosmon> So the strings there ended up with an intermediate path segment which was simply ""
2019-11-19T16:24:01  <Bosmon> What's particularly interesting is that this has never caused a failure before, because it looks like this part of the configuration is simply unused
2019-11-19T16:24:50  <Justin_o> I'm trying to remember what this was all for
2019-11-19T16:25:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it looks like it should be used
2019-11-19T16:26:02  <Justin_o> in that it is being called
2019-11-19T16:26:07  <Bosmon> But what is also further "interesting" is that this kind of selector isn't actually supported in any case
2019-11-19T16:26:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well the "combined" area of the options simply isn't used
2019-11-19T16:26:26  <Bosmon> As I verified by commenting it out completely and finding that the tests passed : P
2019-11-19T16:26:39  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/SyllabificationEnactorTests.js#L293
2019-11-19T16:26:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - historically, we've only ever supported escaping of "." characters in the paths used by the ChangeApplier
2019-11-19T16:26:58  <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe the tests pass because it has no test cases to loop through
2019-11-19T16:27:09  <Bosmon> And not for general references
2019-11-19T16:27:29  <Bosmon> Justin_o - but the thing is, it *always* had no test cases to loop through : P
2019-11-19T16:27:42  <Bosmon> Since in the "old" framework, these selectors just quietly evaluated to undefined
2019-11-19T16:27:47  <Justin_o> ah I see
2019-11-19T16:28:07  <Bosmon> In the FLUID-6426 framework, as well as doing this, they then obnoxiously leave some mouse droppings in the options elsewhere that cause a different test case to fail : P
2019-11-19T16:28:12  <Justin_o> Bosmon: so these are shoddy because they have a "." in the path name
2019-11-19T16:28:32  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well I wouldn't say that they are shoddy
2019-11-19T16:28:40  <Bosmon> So much as that the framework is a bit shoddy : P
2019-11-19T16:28:59  <Bosmon> In the "good old days" of CSpace we used to fret about such things as the cost of parsing references via String.split or otherwise
2019-11-19T16:29:24  <Bosmon> And ever since then it has still been the case that standard IoC references have always just been parsed with String.split(".")
2019-11-19T16:29:40  <Bosmon> Which noone really complained about in this time, although I remember that sgithens cocked a snook at it at one point
2019-11-19T16:30:16  <Bosmon> These days the framework is so magnificently inefficient almost everywhere that it wouldn't make any noticeable difference to parse these things properly
2019-11-19T16:31:05  <Bosmon> But I guess until that gets adjusted we both have "bugs" to fix or at least to work around
2019-11-19T16:31:29  *** avtar_ <avtar_!~avtar@ip-45-3-30-65.user.start.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2019-11-19T16:31:33  <Bosmon> I think in the meantime you can reform these test cases so that they indirect via some string other than the raw class name, and then also put in an "expect" count to verify that the test actually loops over something
2019-11-19T16:32:00  <Bosmon> And I will firstly deal with my mouse droppings and then think about whether we can afford to switch to proper parsing now
2019-11-19T16:32:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: should I leave the PR where it is? or did you want it against your branch?
2019-11-19T16:32:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think this can be a pull against master, since the test is faulty as it stands
2019-11-19T16:32:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, I'll try to take a look at that later today
2019-11-19T16:32:31  <Bosmon> And I'll pull it into the branch from there

2019-11-19T16:41:14  <colinclark> so how about something like 9 am EST?
2019-11-19T16:41:29  <Justin_o> I can do that
2019-11-19T16:41:31  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2019-11-19T16:41:57  <Bosmon> Yup that's fine
2019-11-19T16:43:22  <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: I sent you a calendar invite
2019-11-19T16:43:33  <colinclark> thank you Justin_o
2019-11-19T16:43:35  <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: should cindyli join us as well, or can we cover it between us?
2019-11-19T16:43:46  <colinclark> if cindyli is available, that would be awesome
2019-11-19T16:43:49  <colinclark> but no pressure
2019-11-19T16:44:04  <Justin_o> cindyli: are you able to join our meeting tomorrow morning at 9am EST?
2019-11-19T16:44:24  <Bosmon> Justin_o - we have one tomorrow?
2019-11-19T16:44:32  <Bosmon> Didn't we just decide on Thursday?
2019-11-19T16:44:49  <Justin_o> I thought colinclark suggested tomorrow instead
2019-11-19T16:45:02  <Bosmon> Oh right, I see that now
2019-11-19T16:45:05  <Bosmon> Unfortunately I can't make that slot
2019-11-19T16:45:08  <colinclark> oh ok
2019-11-19T16:45:15  <colinclark> thursday is fine in the morning for me
2019-11-19T16:45:18  <colinclark> when are you available, Justin_o?
2019-11-19T16:45:41  <Justin_o> colinclark: a 9 or 10am EST start on Thursday would be best for me
2019-11-19T16:47:14  <colinclark> 10 am would be great for me
2019-11-19T16:47:21  <colinclark> How about you, Bosmon?
2019-11-19T16:49:25  <Bosmon> Yes, that is fine
2019-11-19T16:49:41  <cindyli> fine with me too

2019-11-19T16:58:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, should I do the work as part of my FLUID-6426 PR or would you prefer a separate one?
2019-11-19T16:59:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - please could you supply a standalone PR for FLUID-6429 against master - cheers!
2019-11-19T17:09:58  <Justin_o> will do

2019-11-19T17:49:56  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, if Joseph's pull genuinely only adds the ability to run new tests, then it seems fair to merge both.  We should confirm with devops tomorrow.

2019-11-19T18:18:45  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I believe the pull being referred to is the one which removes the ContextManager

2019-11-19T18:35:59  <the-t-in-rtf> then that seems really a bit much.
2019-11-19T18:37:29  <the-t-in-rtf> I was referring to the other pull, the one that adds the ability to run the production tests.
2019-11-19T18:40:30  <the-t-in-rtf> the one that was already merged, I see.

2019-11-19T18:46:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: I just realized we have a bit of a problem for the community meeting tomorrow.
2019-11-19T18:47:00  <Justin_o> The webinar is using zoom

2019-11-19T19:11:57  <gmoss> Justin_o: sorry I was in another meeting that ran long. Hmm... I think I have an idea, we can discuss it after the crit?
2019-11-19T19:12:05  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2019-11-19T19:13:31  <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  just noticing your discussion about pull requests with Bosmon.
2019-11-19T19:13:41  <clown> To be clear, fwiw, wrt the prod tests there were two pull requests:  one in universal and one in gpii-infra
2019-11-19T19:14:11  <clown> the one "in the queue" is the gpii-infra one.  it's waiting on "which version of the universal image are we going to use"?
2019-11-19T19:14:50  <clown> the one in universal was merged a while back (as you noted)
2019-11-19T19:16:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - brilliant, thanks!
2019-11-19T19:18:53  <Justin_o> Bosmon: np, it's cleaner now for sure. Using the selectors as keys probably wasn't the best idea to begin with. Hopefully it's all working now.

2019-11-19T19:49:48  <sgithens> Bosmon: I "cocked a snook"??
2019-11-19T19:50:20  <sgithens> cindyli: I assume that when GPII-228 is merged in, you could just use it rather than have to duplicate the snapshotting code correct?
2019-11-19T19:52:01  <cindyli> sgithens: Bosmon said "OK, well we will need to have some kind of explanation/workplan/set of tests before we can accept this code into the codebase"
2019-11-19T19:52:06  <cindyli> this code means that work around
2019-11-19T19:53:19  <sgithens> cindyli: Oh, my branch needs more tests to test that particular work around I made?
2019-11-19T19:54:36  <cindyli> oh, at least there should be a JIRA describing the problem
2019-11-19T19:54:51  <cindyli> of course, would be great to have all 3 in place
2019-11-19T19:56:14  <sgithens> cindyli: Sorry, I'm a little behind on this convo.  So the 3 problems are: 1) Snapshotting in general, 2) The work around for SPI settings, and what's the 3rd issues?
2019-11-19T19:56:27  <sgithens> I think I do have jiras and notes for both of the first 2
2019-11-19T19:56:42  <sgithens> I guess I should nudge my PR's
2019-11-19T19:57:08  <cindyli> sgithens: sorry, the 3 was what Bosmon mentioned about "explanation/workplan/set of tests"
2019-11-19T19:58:44  <cindyli> having a jira is a good start so it can be addressed later
2019-11-19T19:59:33  <sgithens> Is the "explanation/workplan/set of tests" just for your set of work?  I imagine the tests for the above items would just be part of their actual jira

2019-11-19T20:01:10  <cindyli> sgithens: my understanding is "explanation/workplan/set of tests" is for that particular workaround in my branch
2019-11-19T20:01:59  <cindyli> sgithens: what's the jira for that work around?
2019-11-19T20:02:22  <sgithens> cindyli: Let me take a look

2019-11-19T20:05:47  <sgithens> cindyli: Ok, it looks like I just committed everything with GPII-228 as teh commit message, but I suppose this would be the ticket to use if we want to document it more: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3677
2019-11-19T20:06:42  <sgithens> I can add a reference in the jsdoc for the method in my branch
2019-11-19T20:07:13  <cindyli> thanks, sgithens. the linked jira in it describes the details: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3119
2019-11-19T20:07:25  <sgithens> I need to see why the CI is failing for https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/616, but it would probably be good to work on getting that merged in so we don't have to duplicate things
2019-11-19T20:08:04  <sgithens> if you wanted to give it another review in the meantime that would be great too
2019-11-19T20:08:42  <cindyli> sgithens: can you add the jira in the code comment for that work around? thanks
2019-11-19T20:09:07  <sgithens> cindyli: Yup, will do that this afternoon
2019-11-19T20:09:14  <cindyli> thanks
