2019-06-28T05:55:34  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, that's to do the full resource loader refit across multiple projects.
2019-06-28T05:55:57  <the-t-in-rtf> Antranig's workaround gives us a compatible version of gpii-express-user with working tests without that.

2019-06-28T07:41:51  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, as promised, 1.0.2-dev.20190628T073950Z.6efdc50.GPII-3921 is cut
2019-06-28T07:43:00  <the-t-in-rtf> you don't necessarily need to upgrade, as that only fixes client-side forms you don't use yourself.
2019-06-28T07:43:32  <the-t-in-rtf> but I am going to flag the previous dev release with a warning, as it makes me itchy to have a release out there that doesn't pass its own tests
2019-06-28T07:47:43  <the-t-in-rtf> well, that had broken client side components, the tests weren't wrong

2019-06-28T17:02:38  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Awesome.  Amazing you were able to fix that up so fast, I should take a look at the diff from it
2019-06-28T17:04:51  <the-t-in-rtf> It went through a few iterations
2019-06-28T17:05:23  <the-t-in-rtf> there were three references that needed to be passed in, and then we discussed why the function was being hit at all in that pre-onCreate state
2019-06-28T17:05:52  <the-t-in-rtf> and I proposed a refactor to avoid listening to model changes for "init"
2019-06-28T17:06:01  <the-t-in-rtf> and then manually checking as part of onCreate
2019-06-28T17:06:30  <the-t-in-rtf> with that I could remove the additional IoC references
2019-06-28T17:07:03  <the-t-in-rtf> so the error binder itself looks a lot like it did, the schema validated model component grade was updated as a second better fix.
2019-06-28T17:09:32  <the-t-in-rtf> There's the merged pull if you want to see the changes
2019-06-28T17:09:33  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-json-schema/pull/17
2019-06-28T17:09:53  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Cheers!
2019-06-28T17:09:56  <the-t-in-rtf> that immediately unblocked the point where I was stuck in gpii-express-user, I'd already done that work a while ago
2019-06-28T17:10:13  <the-t-in-rtf> that's why that part was pretty speedy
2019-06-28T17:10:30  <sgithens> I didn't realize you had to do work in gpii-json-schema for it as well
2019-06-28T17:12:58  <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-json-schema in recent versions has context aware detection for whether infusion is pre or post potentia ii
2019-06-28T17:13:10  <the-t-in-rtf> part of this was that gpii-json-schema (like universal) is still pre-potentia-ii
2019-06-28T17:13:35  <the-t-in-rtf> and it highlighted issues that I couldn't test in gpii-json-schema itself and still test the potentia-ii stuff.
2019-06-28T17:13:52  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, gpii-express-user is pre potentia ii
2019-06-28T17:14:08  <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-json-schema supports both but itself uses potentia ii
2019-06-28T17:14:43  <the-t-in-rtf> so gpii-express-user ended up being where I found the limitations of the approach used in gpii-json-schema
2019-06-28T17:14:57  <the-t-in-rtf> (in pre-potentia-ii versions of infusion)
2019-06-28T17:23:46  <the-t-in-rtf> If we were going to straddle the line for a long time by rights I would have created pre-potentia-ii tests for the error binder
