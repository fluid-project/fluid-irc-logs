2019-03-20T11:03:34  <jhernandez> do you want me to produce a new npm release of gpii-windows and update https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/93
2019-03-20T11:03:41  <jhernandez> it'd be great if we can get that one merged
2019-03-20T11:13:20  <stegru> it just doesn't apply ours - I don't know why. They work if I rename the theme file over the built-in one
2019-03-20T11:15:55  <jhernandez> Bosmon: nevermind, just saw there's already a new gpii-windows release - updating my pull now

2019-03-20T13:34:16  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, Sandra sent a note, but we still have two more weeks of the daylight savings shakeup
2019-03-20T13:34:19  <the-t-in-rtf> can someone update the invite?

2019-03-20T14:15:06  <jhernandez> Bosmon: cindyli stegru - quick question
2019-03-20T14:15:26  <Bosmon> Hey there vvernnanddezz
2019-03-20T14:15:42  <jhernandez> I've been asked to generate an installer for people to start testing the last UI changes
2019-03-20T14:15:48  <jhernandez> the question is ..
2019-03-20T14:16:04  <jhernandez> do you want me to also include the auto key-in thing?
2019-03-20T14:16:20  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well why not, if we can target it at the functioning staging server
2019-03-20T14:16:27  <jhernandez> I'd need to create a secret blower with secrets
2019-03-20T14:16:45  <Bosmon> The earlier we can do this ahead of our date of leaving the EU on the 29th of March, the better
2019-03-20T14:17:06  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I think you can do it without the secret blower for now?
2019-03-20T14:17:19  <Bosmon> Doesn't the code default to the old-fashioned non-secret if it can't find one?
2019-03-20T14:17:47  <jhernandez> well, the thing is that the service rejects any communication without a valid secrets file
2019-03-20T14:18:08  <jhernandez> unless I'm wrong and we can do such thing
2019-03-20T14:18:14  <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2019-03-20T14:18:14  <jhernandez> ?
2019-03-20T14:18:46  <jhernandez> Bosmon: it's not doing that, but maybe there's a config flag or the like that I might be missing
2019-03-20T14:19:36  <Bosmon> If not it is probably quicker for stegru to tweak his branch with a fallback than it would be for you to make and distribute a blower
2019-03-20T14:20:02  <Bosmon> But it would be great to get any early notice of any show-stopping deals with the auto keyin
2019-03-20T14:21:36  <jhernandez> in that secret blower I would include the secret shipped within universal
2019-03-20T14:22:05  <jhernandez> this way I don't need to add the credentials to the cloud
2019-03-20T14:22:22  <jhernandez> which is not a big deal either
2019-03-20T14:23:21  <jhernandez> well, let's wait for stegru's advice
2019-03-20T14:24:11  <jhernandez> but yes, ahead testing of the auto key-in can be started
2019-03-20T14:24:50  <jhernandez> in any case, I don't see you leaving on the 29th :P

2019-03-20T16:38:08  <stegru> jhernandez, I've almost fixed it - but it looks a bit shit, I wonder if it's better to just have a "non-secret secret" file that gets included with the standard installer?

2019-03-20T16:50:33  <jhernandez> a "non-secret secret" sounds good to me, but, what kind of access to the cloud would this "no-secret secret" have
2019-03-20T16:50:35  <jhernandez> ?
2019-03-20T16:51:29  <stegru> well, the same as the current client credentials in pilot.json
2019-03-20T16:51:30  <jhernandez> retrieve settings/create and save prefs sets?
2019-03-20T16:52:35  <jhernandez> then, we should provide a slightly different service config file to point to the right secrets file? or would the service take care of that?
2019-03-20T16:53:14  <stegru> I think just using the same file would be ok
2019-03-20T16:53:43  <stegru> but I've made a quick fix to make it work this way: <Bosmon> Doesn't the code default to the old-fashioned non-secret if it can't find one?
2019-03-20T16:56:21  <stegru> yes, scrap the idea about the non-secret secret - it will cock things up with the auto-login

2019-03-20T17:29:28  <jhernandez> we need to generate this https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/dbData/clientCredentials.json
2019-03-20T17:30:00  <jhernandez> but, do we also want to generate a https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/dbData/gpiiAppInstallationClients.json for specific locations? let's say, nova?
2019-03-20T17:32:00  <jhernandez> I'm asking this because the clientCredentials are including a reference to the gpiiAppInstallationClient
2019-03-20T17:32:01  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/dbData/clientCredentials.json#L6
2019-03-20T17:33:12  <jhernandez> not urgent, but I'd like to know if, when creating the secrets for the upcoming nova deployment, if we need to also generate a clientId doc along with the clientCredentials that need to go to the cloud side

2019-03-20T17:41:10  <cindyli> jhernandez: yes, records for both document types should be generated with a matching "clientId" value - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/dbData/clientCredentials.json#L6
2019-03-20T17:41:21  <cindyli> thanks for bringing it up.
2019-03-20T17:42:03  <jhernandez> ok, thanks for confirming

2019-03-20T17:42:38  <jhernandez> also, is there any utility around that I can reuse to create an script to generate these?
2019-03-20T17:43:21  <cindyli> jhernandez: sorryo, we don't have a script for generating client credentials.
2019-03-20T17:43:22  <jhernandez> I guess that we should have a script in universal that generates such files, right?
2019-03-20T17:43:39  <cindyli> that would be great i think
2019-03-20T17:44:03  <jhernandez> ok ok, no problem, I'll do that
2019-03-20T17:44:06  <jhernandez> thanks
2019-03-20T17:44:07  <jhernandez> :)
2019-03-20T17:44:21  <cindyli> thank YOU, jhernandez. let me know if you need help. i'm around ;)
2019-03-20T17:44:55  <jhernandez> sure, will do if needed, thanks!

2019-03-20T19:29:33  <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2019-03-20T19:29:39  <cindyli> skype?

2019-03-20T20:12:37  <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru: how about these two pulls? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/725 and https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/80
2019-03-20T20:13:33  <stegru> don't worry about the universal one, jhernandez
2019-03-20T20:13:55  <stegru> nor gpii-app
2019-03-20T20:13:59  <jhernandez> nor gpii-app?
2019-03-20T20:14:05  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-03-20T20:14:43  <stegru> they're on hold.. the requirements need to be revisited
2019-03-20T20:14:52  <jhernandez> yes, I know
2019-03-20T20:15:22  <jhernandez> so for now, we don't have a configure flag to enable/disable the autoLogin, right?
2019-03-20T20:15:29  <stegru> ah
2019-03-20T20:15:44  <stegru> well, if the secrets file isn't installed, then it doesn't work
2019-03-20T20:16:17  <jhernandez> hmm
2019-03-20T20:17:35  <jhernandez> not even with the change to use old-fashioned non-secret secret you pushed earlier?
2019-03-20T20:17:36  <stegru> by that I mean, when gpii starts it will ask the service for something in the secrets file, and the service will return an error
2019-03-20T20:17:55  <stegru> right
2019-03-20T20:18:36  <stegru> during login, it mixes the windows account id with the domain value in the secrets file
2019-03-20T20:19:04  <jhernandez> oh, right
2019-03-20T20:19:05  <stegru> but if the secrets file isn't there, then there no domain to use, and the login listener will fail
2019-03-20T20:19:13  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-03-20T20:19:14  <jhernandez> got it
2019-03-20T20:19:47  <stegru> ok.. this isn't exactly an "on/off" configuration.. but it basically means "no secrets file == no auto-login"
2019-03-20T20:19:58  <jhernandez> totally makes sense
2019-03-20T20:20:05  *** michelled1 <michelled1!~Adium@205.211.168.105> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-03-20T20:20:32  <Bosmon> stegru - that's a bit odd
2019-03-20T20:20:35  <jhernandez> but, could we decouple thatt?
2019-03-20T20:20:39  <stegru> in version 1.1 of the auto-login, there will be a configuration ;)
2019-03-20T20:20:40  <Bosmon> Gregg's plan was for the domain value to be in the siteconfig, not in the secrets file
2019-03-20T20:20:46  <Bosmon> The secrets file should simply be a secret
2019-03-20T20:20:57  <stegru> ok
2019-03-20T20:22:08  <jhernandez> a secret secret

2019-03-20T20:23:02  <jhernandez> but for now, it's fine for testing
2019-03-20T20:23:14  <stegru> yes, there's no reason why the domain should be a secret, and it doesn't need to be taken from that file
2019-03-20T20:23:44  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@205.211.168.101> has joined #fluid-work
2019-03-20T20:27:46  <stegru> ok.. here's my (retrospective) reasoning.. changing the domain would invalidate the gpii-keys. there's more chance of it being changed while in the siteconfig, than in the secrets file
2019-03-20T20:28:05  <Bosmon> stegru indeed, but that is the funeral of the person who changed it
2019-03-20T20:28:11  <Bosmon> I think we already went through this reasoning with Gregg
2019-03-20T20:28:18  <stegru> yes
2019-03-20T20:28:38  <Bosmon> "There's all kinds of changes which can be made to the site config which will make the system screwed up forever"
2019-03-20T20:28:51  <Bosmon> I think was the observation I made to Gregg
2019-03-20T20:31:18  <stegru> well, I can't put my finger on why it's not a good idea.. it doesn't feel right. not because I have attachment to what I've implemented or anything like that
2019-03-20T20:32:02  <Bosmon> It may not be the best idea, but it's a better idea than having it in the secrets place : P
2019-03-20T20:32:28  <stegru> well, I disagree - but I don't know why
2019-03-20T20:32:57  <Bosmon> I don't see why it should be correlated with the secret at all, that is a per-machine thing
2019-03-20T20:33:00  <Bosmon> In theory
2019-03-20T20:33:17  <stegru> well! that changes my view
2019-03-20T20:33:23  <Bosmon> And the only function of the domain is just to stop keys from colliding
2019-03-20T20:33:39  <stegru> yes, that's right
2019-03-20T20:33:43  <Bosmon> Once we have "proper" secrets, the server will just indirect from the secret to whatever it thinks the domain really should be

2019-03-20T20:34:04  <Bosmon> That is, the thing which encodes security policies and stuff like that
2019-03-20T20:35:08  <stegru> it's not ideal, but we will deliver this by 29th of march!
2019-03-20T20:35:14  <Bosmon> Quite
2019-03-20T20:35:24  <stegru> the will of gregg
2019-03-20T20:35:29  <Bosmon> And anyone who recklessly urges us towards "no deal" will get what they deserve
2019-03-20T20:36:16  <jhernandez> I like Mr Speaker
2019-03-20T20:36:40  <stegru> he's great... i've never really noticed him before
2019-03-20T20:37:12  <stegru> I want his chair
2019-03-20T20:37:44  <jhernandez> I want his ties
2019-03-20T20:38:21  <jhernandez> doesn't look like a comfortable chair :P
2019-03-20T20:38:33  <stegru> ok stepping out of the mindset that the secrets will not be per-site, yes, it's a bad idea to store per-site things in it
2019-03-20T20:38:49  <stegru> better than a bench
2019-03-20T20:39:17  <stegru> it has fold-out armrests, and pockets
2019-03-20T20:39:53  <jhernandez> AND POCKETS!! xD
2019-03-20T20:40:58  <jhernandez> I agree with Bosmon's point, the domain should be just used to stop keys from colliding
2019-03-20T20:41:37  <stegru> I agree with your agreement

2019-03-20T20:44:19  <stegru> I'll also put a switch for the auto-login in the site-config
