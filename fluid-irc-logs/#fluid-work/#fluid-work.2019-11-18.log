2019-11-18T16:21:14  <Justin_o> that sounds interesting
2019-11-18T16:21:28  <colinclark> I think he is protesting the felling of a very beautiful tree nearby

2019-11-18T17:09:37  <Justin_o> alanharnum, avtar: would you like to join us, curious to know your thoughts compared to Jenkins
2019-11-18T17:13:05  <simonjb> Justin_o: one advantage I can see compared to running our own Jenkins server is that the GitHub Action jobs are associated with the repo, which means that anyone who forks a repo gets CI immediately without the need to make any Jenkins changes to watch the new forked repo
2019-11-18T17:14:27  <alanharnum> Justin_o: happy to join, have not used GitHub Actions yet, but would like to hear thoughts of others
2019-11-18T17:14:56  <simonjb> I see them as potentially complementary for the C2LC project -- GitHub Actions for running tests and build checks and Jenkins for deployment

2019-11-18T17:15:15  <alanharnum> from an operational perspective, doing our CI with a managed service is good from a "less things to manage ourselves" standpoint
2019-11-18T17:16:07  <Justin_o> simonjb: yes, that's nice.. I think I read that they don't work on forks by default.. but not sure if that's just something would need to be configured in the fork or in the parent
2019-11-18T17:16:41  <greatislander> I think it needs to be enabled once you fork—so the config file is there but it doesn't start running actions right away
2019-11-18T17:16:44  <Justin_o> simonjb: I'm also interested about this complementary approach
2019-11-18T17:17:05  <Justin_o> greatislander: cool, that sounds simple enough
2019-11-18T17:17:22  <greatislander> (haven't done this but I think that's what I saw somewhere)
2019-11-18T17:18:23  <simonjb> danielcho: when you merged the c2lc-coding-environment GitHub Actions workflow file into your repo, did you need to enable GitHub Actions or did it just start working?
2019-11-18T17:18:51  <simonjb> I see the CI running on danielcho's repo: https://github.com/chosww/c2lc-coding-environment/commits/C2LC-19
2019-11-18T17:18:52  <danielcho> it just started working without enabling it
2019-11-18T17:19:01  <greatislander> I stand corrected
2019-11-18T17:19:47  <Justin_o> the other benefit I see to GitHub actions is that they have macOS runners too
2019-11-18T17:20:42  <Justin_o> simonjb, danielcho: how do I see that the GitHub actions ran on danielcho's repo?
2019-11-18T17:20:58  <simonjb> https://github.com/chosww/c2lc-coding-environment/commits/C2LC-19
2019-11-18T17:21:02  <simonjb> the checkmarks
2019-11-18T17:21:06  <simonjb> on the commits
2019-11-18T17:21:07  <danielcho> you can click on Actions tab
2019-11-18T17:21:15  <danielcho> ^as well
2019-11-18T17:21:34  <simonjb> and the Actions tab :)
2019-11-18T17:21:35  <Justin_o> ah I see them in both places now, thanks
2019-11-18T17:21:50  <danielcho> 👍
2019-11-18T17:26:01  <simonjb> Justin_o: one thing that's definitely different (simpler) in the C2LC GitHub Actions build compared to Infusion is that all of our tests are 'headless' and we don't do any browser remote controlling
2019-11-18T17:26:21  <simonjb> I don't know if that's something GitHub Actions support in their provided VMs
2019-11-18T17:27:03  <simonjb> you could presumably manage it with custum runners
2019-11-18T17:27:45  <simonjb> but right now our UI tests are using jsdom rather than real browser(s)
2019-11-18T17:30:35  <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks, that's interesting
2019-11-18T17:31:03  <Justin_o> could be a barrier if we aren't able to access real browsers. we have talked about using them in headless mode too, but would still need to have access to the browsers themselves

2019-11-18T20:04:38  <Justin_o> old
2019-11-18T20:04:54  <Justin_o> cindyli: if I add the grades directly into the gradeNames, it works... ;(
2019-11-18T20:05:02  <Justin_o> I wonder if it's some sort of timing issue or something
2019-11-18T20:05:17  <cindyli> odd. i believe using an invoker in the gradeNames has been used many times in the old framework
2019-11-18T20:05:29  <Justin_o> I'm basically trying to get the auxiliary schemas the same way that the primary builder sources the primary schemas.
2019-11-18T20:05:33  <cindyli> Justin_o: where's your code?
2019-11-18T20:06:01  <Justin_o> cindyli: here's the snippet
2019-11-18T20:06:10  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/VGDNLAvn/
2019-11-18T20:06:37  <Justin_o> although you'll have to swap between the various gradeNames sections that are commented out
2019-11-18T20:07:19  <cindyli> ok
2019-11-18T20:07:21  <Justin_o> cindyli: from what I can tell, fluid.uio.buildAuxiliary is returning the correct array of gradeNames for the various auxiliary schema grades I have
2019-11-18T20:07:48  <Justin_o> if you happen to want to run this, you'll need to use my fluid-6420 branch that has the auxiliary schemas separated
2019-11-18T20:07:54  <cindyli> ok
2019-11-18T20:08:23  <Justin_o> and would need to comment out the fluid.prefs.auxSchema.starter grade from StarterSchemas.js
2019-11-18T20:09:27  <cindyli> Justin_o: is it ok to have buildAuxiliary return an array of gradenames?
2019-11-18T20:09:32  <cindyli> never used this case
2019-11-18T20:09:54  <cindyli> only used with invoker returning a string of one grade name
2019-11-18T20:10:28  <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, should be okay.. the primary builder already does this, and I have actually done this in my fluid-6420 branch already.. although I need to change that system for a different reason that is breaking with the new framework
2019-11-18T20:10:44  <cindyli> i see
2019-11-18T20:12:49  <Justin_o> cindyli: I did try changing it to just returning one as a string and I'm having the same issue. The gradeName is added, but none of it's options are merged in
2019-11-18T20:13:59  <cindyli> Justin_o: weird, another way to try is to have buildAuxiliary() return all grade names including "fluid.component", "fluid.prefs.primaryBuilder"
2019-11-18T20:14:19  <cindyli> so line 12 looks like
2019-11-18T20:14:24  <cindyli> gradeNames: ["{that}.buildAuxiliary"]
2019-11-18T20:14:26  <Justin_o> you'd need to at least have "fluid.component" or it will throw an error
2019-11-18T20:14:34  <cindyli> i know
2019-11-18T20:14:53  <cindyli> set them as default initial values at line 62
2019-11-18T20:14:53  <Justin_o> I also removed "fluid.prefs.primaryBuilder" grade and still have same issue
2019-11-18T20:15:03  *** christopher <christopher!~textual@24.171.222.55> has joined #fluid-work
2019-11-18T20:15:09  <cindyli> var auxSchema = ["fluid.component", "fluid.prefs.primaryBuilder"]
2019-11-18T20:16:54  <Justin_o> cindyli: that throws an error because you need to have a real grade in the gradeNames to start with
2019-11-18T20:17:04  <Justin_o> I guess so that it knows what to do with the invoker reference
2019-11-18T20:17:05  <cindyli> oh no
2019-11-18T20:18:20  <gmoss> cindyli I'm available to pair now if you are. I was also planning to meet with Justin_o at some point this afternoon
2019-11-18T20:18:43  <gmoss> but I believe he's busy very soon until 4:30
2019-11-18T20:19:20  <cindyli> gmoss: i've already issued a pull request for your race condition problem. see my comment on your SJRK-297 pull request
2019-11-18T20:19:49  <cindyli> hope it helps

2019-11-18T20:21:48  <gmoss> cindyli: I'll run it and see, thanks! I still don't think I understand how the previous setup led to a race condition, so it would be great to talk through that. your change makes perfect sense, all the same, so if it passes my tests I'll be merging it :)
2019-11-18T20:22:59  <cindyli> gmoss: we can talk through it any time you want

2019-11-18T20:24:29  <cindyli> i feel the cause is obvious because we couldn't define "priority" for distributeOptions blocks so when you have multiple distributeOptions on the same component trying to distribute the same option value, it's hard to predict which one gets executed first.
2019-11-18T20:25:45  <Justin_o> cindyli: I figured it out.. I actually ran into a similar problem when working on FLUID-6426. I had passed in an IoC reference in the invoker to the auxiliarySchema property. (see line 32). Because the grades that are generated from that invoker are also trying to affect that property they are not showing up because the IoC reference is already evaluated to pass that value into the invoker.
2019-11-18T20:26:32  <gmoss> cindyli: I suppose I wasn't quite clear on the implicit priorities in merging between what's specified in a component's grade, what is in each of its grade names and the order between those as well (rightmost wins, iirc)
2019-11-18T20:26:43  <cindyli> Justin_o: smart! great to learn a new thing
2019-11-18T20:27:11  <Justin_o> cindyli: it took me all afternoon to figure that out ;(
2019-11-18T20:27:50  <cindyli> Justin_o: it could be worse so don't cry ;)
2019-11-18T20:27:58  <Justin_o> lol
2019-11-18T20:30:17  <greatislander> justin_o simonjb alanharnum where shall we meet?
2019-11-18T20:30:25  <cindyli> gmoss: ya. totally understand. we've all struggled with this kind of situation and learnt from these strugglings ;)
2019-11-18T20:30:33  <Justin_o> greatislander: want to meet in zoom?
2019-11-18T20:30:35  <greatislander> sure
