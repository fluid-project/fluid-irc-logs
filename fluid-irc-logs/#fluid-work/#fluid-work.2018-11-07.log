2018-11-07T16:34:52  <jhernandez> is that .... text?
2018-11-07T16:35:01  <stegru> it's a button
2018-11-07T16:35:28  <stegru> well, it can be anything
2018-11-07T16:35:36  <stegru> like an icon
2018-11-07T16:35:52  <jhernandez> but
2018-11-07T16:36:03  <stegru> head
2018-11-07T16:36:10  <jhernandez> is this something that we could make through electron?
2018-11-07T16:36:32  <stegru> no
2018-11-07T16:36:44  <jhernandez> hm
2018-11-07T16:36:46  <jhernandez> no
2018-11-07T16:36:52  <jhernandez> I see
2018-11-07T16:37:05  <jhernandez> but yes from a window service
2018-11-07T16:37:12  <jhernandez> ?
2018-11-07T16:37:32  <stegru> well, anything.. node.js + ffi
2018-11-07T16:37:33  <jhernandez> but how do we attach our "thing" to that button?
2018-11-07T16:37:57  <jhernandez> thing = gpii-app
2018-11-07T16:38:06  <stegru> well, i made the button. i can make it do what i want
2018-11-07T16:38:40  <jhernandez> can it make me a coffee?
2018-11-07T16:38:51  <jhernandez> jokes apart
2018-11-07T16:40:15  <jhernandez> is the language icon tray the same thing?
2018-11-07T16:41:13  <stegru> no, it's not.. i just made a window, and made it a child of the taskbar, and squeezed it in between the window list and notification area
2018-11-07T16:43:56  <stegru> we can make it show the qss when it's clicked

2018-11-07T18:16:02  <jhernandez> in any case, I guess that we should wait until Bosmon is back and we talk about it before taking this approach to UX, which I guess thing should pass through
