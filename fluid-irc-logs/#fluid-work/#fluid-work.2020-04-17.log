2020-04-17T13:34:01  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: hey there
2020-04-17T13:34:20  <jhernandez> I've spent some time pulling your windows branch, running tests, etc
2020-04-17T13:34:25  <jhernandez> and it's super weird
2020-04-17T13:34:30  <jhernandez> VERY
2020-04-17T13:35:20  <jhernandez> in fact, I checked the payloads end-to-end and everything looks great
2020-04-17T13:36:47  <jhernandez> this is, I checked that the lifecycleInstructions are good, the setting hits the settings handler
2020-04-17T13:39:20  <jhernandez> as Antranig pointed out yesterday, I guess that we're likely facing issues due to race conditions and I'd say that your changes, somehow, are making some of them more evident
2020-04-17T13:40:11  <jhernandez> in addition to the race conditions, testing some windows features is a nightmare but I blame on windows
2020-04-17T13:41:23  <jhernandez> we've doing all our best to test it in a reliable way, and I doubt that MS have reliable tests
2020-04-17T13:41:29  <jhernandez> :/

2020-04-17T13:47:15  <jhernandez> I'd say that, as part of the effort in offboarding some features, I'd recommend to revisit our builtIn acceptance tests in a way that we can run some of them in an isolated way

2020-04-17T19:11:42  <Bosmon> Hi there gtirloni - just about to merge your THING, but I'm noticing that you are pushing your updates in some slightly odd way which results in this kind of message - "gtirloni force-pushed the gtirloni:FLUID-6486 branch from d1cc34a to 6cfff55 24 minutes ago"
2020-04-17T19:11:59  <Bosmon> Which I think makes it slightly hard to see what the reason for the update is - could you say what you are doing?
2020-04-17T19:12:19  <Bosmon> I'm wondering whether the traditional method of merging and then pushing a standard merge commit might end up being more informative
2020-04-17T19:12:30  <gtirloni> hey, hmm.. I rebased master into my branch
2020-04-17T19:12:47  <gtirloni> yeah, that might be more informative
2020-04-17T19:13:46  <gtirloni> I'm fine merging.. I think I picked up the habit of rebasing from other projects I was required to do it, but I don't have a preference in this case
2020-04-17T19:13:48  <Bosmon> I never did understand rebasing :)
2020-04-17T19:14:34  <gtirloni> haha yeah, it complicates a few things
2020-04-17T19:14:55  <gmoss> and rewrites history! :P
2020-04-17T19:15:40  <Bosmon> Yes I wonder what kind of person wants their history rewritten
2020-04-17T19:16:16  <gtirloni> lol
2020-04-17T19:24:45  <chaitanya> oh!  I rewritten the history a few days back.
