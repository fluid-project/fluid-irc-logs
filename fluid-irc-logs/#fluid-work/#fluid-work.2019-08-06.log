2019-08-06T14:35:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - my current feeling is that the quickest way out of gmoss race conditions in the SJRK tests here https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/35/files#diff-34660a802456b95fca32b869dfa02893R229 might be to update him to my upcoming framework branch where this code got rewritten
2019-08-06T14:36:01  <Bosmon> It is something we would have to do anyway if we got it merged and I guess it is better to have any other risks with this checked out sooner rather than later
2019-08-06T14:41:03  <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for sharing... it seems reasonable, especially because it is something we'd have to do eventually. However, I believe SJRK is running an older version of Infusion and I can't remember why. Could have been waiting for these tests, or maybe it was something related to changes in the prefs framework. We'd need to double check with gmoss about other factors that may prevent upgrading at this point.
2019-08-06T14:41:26  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well I'll make sure the upgrade works at my end first before bothering him
2019-08-06T14:41:53  <Justin_o> thanks
2019-08-06T14:41:58  <Bosmon> I need to make a few fixes in my branch anyway to make it closer to a drop-in replacement for the relocalisation functionality
2019-08-06T14:42:22  <Bosmon> And in practice these are features that the-t-in-rtf are going to use too
2019-08-06T14:42:29  *** crystalchan <crystalchan!Adium@nat/ocadu/x-ntplbnikhbihgklv> has left #fluid-work
2019-08-06T14:43:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you want, you can also add a new prefs framework localization example. currently there is only one that is there to represent an integrator using a URL scheme for changing languages, but it would good to have one that works on the page without requiring a page reload.

2019-08-06T14:43:52  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, a good idea
2019-08-06T14:44:34  <Bosmon> If I am particularly successful I may be able to produce a purely model-driven relocalization, but this depends on other work in fixing up the modelComponent lifecycle
2019-08-06T14:45:00  <Bosmon> If it is looking like it will take too long, I may leave gmoss with a stop-gap driven by a function call in the meantime
2019-08-06T14:45:31  <Justin_o> okay, sounds good... hopefully the model driven approach will work out

2019-08-06T16:01:23  <gmoss> Bosmon Justin_o thanks for working on this issue! Updating to the latest dev release of Infusion is a case of "unknown unknowns", so I'm not sure how much it entails without digging into it. With some work coming up on the ILDH redesign and possibly one other website, it may also take me some time to get to the update work, so please don't feel pressure from me to provide a stopgap solution in a way that would preclude
2019-08-06T16:01:23  <gmoss> "doing it right"
2019-08-06T16:02:01  <Bosmon> gmoss - don't worry, I'll do your upgrade for you : P

2019-08-06T16:05:04  <Bosmon> gmoss - but so far I am doing ok working with your SJRK-255 branch
2019-08-06T16:05:31  <Bosmon> You perhaps saw some review comments going by on that thread, they are in general "nice to have" but I think at the end of the day probably not responsible for your test failures

2019-08-06T16:05:49  <Bosmon> Although I think it will be important to ensure that you clean up your BrowsePage instances between test cases

2019-08-06T17:40:27  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that was a long discussion.. a bit sad too.. but I'm curious, what sort of implementation for cancellable promises are you thinking of?
2019-08-06T17:40:43  <Bosmon> Justin_o - a very simple one :)
2019-08-06T17:41:22  <Bosmon> We will add a new method, "cancel", to our promises, together with a new disposition string and a 3rd possible arg for "then"
2019-08-06T17:42:32  <Bosmon> There's a bit of 4-yr-old thought on this JIRA: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5790
2019-08-06T17:42:38  <Bosmon> But I think our use case is fairly clear
2019-08-06T17:42:59  <Bosmon> One of the main reasons that gmoss may run into a race condition is that a bunch of AJAX fetches for message bundles may already be in flight at the point the locale changes
2019-08-06T17:43:36  <Justin_o> Bosmon: wouldn't something like the remoteModel grade handle that
2019-08-06T17:43:54  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also would this cancellation work with sequences?
2019-08-06T17:44:47  <Bosmon> Justin_o - for remoteModel, it might help, but that implementation is too bulky to build into every ResourceLoader in the system
2019-08-06T17:45:00  <Bosmon> Also there is currently no expectation that the returned resources will always be modellised
2019-08-06T17:45:24  <Bosmon> As for sequences, this will be a very lightweight implementation whose primary purpose is to ensure that the promise will never resolve
2019-08-06T17:45:45  <Bosmon> So cancelling any member of a promise sequence (assuming you can do it in time) will ensure that the overall sequence does not resolve
2019-08-06T17:46:16  <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit will begin in 15 minutes. Today we're talking about the IDRC website info. architecture redesign.
2019-08-06T17:46:17  <Bosmon> Typically promise cancellation is immediately followed by deleting any references to the cancelled promise, but the problem to be solved is what happens to any callbacks that were due to be notified
2019-08-06T17:46:56  <Bosmon> In addition, specifically, with an AJAX-backed promise we can provide the additional courtesy of forwarding the cancellation to a call to xhr.abort()
2019-08-06T17:47:49  *** colinclark <colinclark!~colinclar@192-0-158-138.cpe.teksavvy.com> has joined #fluid-work
2019-08-06T17:49:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you say does not resolve, do you also mean that it won't reject too?
2019-08-06T17:52:35  <Bosmon> Justin_o - indeed
2019-08-06T17:52:43  <Bosmon> It is simply GONE
2019-08-06T17:53:18  <Justin_o> Bosmon: and you set things up like promise.then(resolveFn, rejectFn, cancelFn)?
2019-08-06T17:53:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2019-08-06T17:53:40  <Justin_o> Is there a way to know when something is simply done.. that is resolved or rejected?
2019-08-06T17:53:59  <Bosmon> Registering a handler for cancelFn will be extremely rare - when you have a possibility to hand a cancellation on to an upstream resources such as xhr.abort()
2019-08-06T17:54:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the existing resolve/reject semantics will be unchanced
2019-08-06T17:54:10  <Bosmon> unchanged
2019-08-06T17:54:29  <Bosmon> It's just that a cancelled promise will never reject or resolve
2019-08-06T17:55:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so the "disposition" property can be used to see if it has completed? Will that have something registered for a cancelled promise?
2019-08-06T17:55:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: or when you say the promise is GONE, does that mean that my references to it will be broken?
2019-08-06T17:56:09  <Justin_o> the reference will point at undefined?
2019-08-06T17:57:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean it is morally gone
2019-08-06T17:57:31  <Bosmon> Justin_o - naturally the site wherever the promise is hosted has to do the business of getting rid of the reference
2019-08-06T17:57:40  <Bosmon> But given it has decided to nullify the promise it will have been doing this anyway
2019-08-06T17:58:07  <Bosmon> But as FLUID-5790 explains, this semantic is very similar to the one we already have with event listeners and invokers
2019-08-06T17:58:50  <Bosmon> Although we are not using the promises in the infrastructural way that the JIRA is describing and probably never will
2019-08-06T17:59:02  <Bosmon> We're just heading off a few races in otherwise fairly conventional code ....
2019-08-06T17:59:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, but I'm thinking about cases where the promise is shared, for example returned by a function or followed
2019-08-06T17:59:58  <Justin_o> but it sounds like those won't break
2019-08-06T18:02:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I expect the effects to be mild to nonexistent, yes
2019-08-06T18:02:31  <Bosmon> It was very interesting to read that github thread to find what some of the opposing arguments were
2019-08-06T18:03:19  <Bosmon> But they all seem to be extremely esoteric
2019-08-06T18:03:56  <Bosmon> Relating to upgrading a cancellation to a CancelError during "await", etc : P
