2018-11-29T13:33:20  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the PR to fix up the coverage reporting for UIO+
2018-11-29T13:34:16  <the-t-in-rtf> Sure, it turned out to be an old frenemy.
2018-11-29T13:34:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I encountered the exact same problem updating another package not minutes later.
2018-11-29T13:34:48  <Justin_o> oh really
2018-11-29T13:35:15  <Justin_o> glad you knew what to look for though.. hopefully all the packages are cleaned up now
2018-11-29T13:35:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I remembered it only vaguely from a few earlier pulls, but for my last pull I caught the temp-directory setting on sight.
2018-11-29T13:35:27  <the-t-in-rtf> (after figuring out that was the problem in UIO+)
2018-11-29T13:36:11  <the-t-in-rtf> If you don't have .nyc_output in your .gitignore, you'll catch it immediately.
2018-11-29T13:36:20  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. new content there is a warning sign.
2018-11-29T13:36:26  <the-t-in-rtf> and you'll see it in your git status.
2018-11-29T13:37:30  <the-t-in-rtf> run the coverage locally, it looks so so much better
2018-11-29T13:37:37  <the-t-in-rtf> there may still be issues, but it's 95%+ now
2018-11-29T13:38:12  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yes, i ran it and it looks much better now. I also like that the tests no longer show up in the reports.. i guess that should have been a red flag too
2018-11-29T13:38:44  *** georgit <georgit!~georgi.to@37.157.190.158> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2018-11-29T13:38:47  <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2018-11-29T13:38:58  <the-t-in-rtf> I started digging actually because you were using the command line options
2018-11-29T13:39:00  *** georgit <georgit!~georgi.to@37.157.190.158> has joined #fluid-work
2018-11-29T13:39:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I was gonna convert it just to clean up the test commands and then realised
2018-11-29T13:40:01  <the-t-in-rtf> I usually make a config file with the right dirs, includes/excludes, and no reporting
2018-11-29T13:40:07  <the-t-in-rtf> and then run the report command with a reporter flag
2018-11-29T13:40:16  <the-t-in-rtf> that's best for these multi-environment setups
2018-11-29T13:40:23  <the-t-in-rtf> you can use most of the settings for both the reporting and the node tests
2018-11-29T13:40:49  <the-t-in-rtf> the other thing is that you weren't disabling the "clean" option in  NYC
2018-11-29T13:41:01  <the-t-in-rtf> so if you ever ran the tests in the other order with the right dirs, same problem
2018-11-29T13:41:14  <the-t-in-rtf> because NYC would helpfully chuck out the browser results on its run.
2018-11-29T13:41:38  <the-t-in-rtf> it's fine, really, but if we notice these timing-proffing tips, better to fix them
2018-11-29T13:41:49  <the-t-in-rtf> proofing, even
2018-11-29T13:41:57  <Justin_o> so many issues. thanks for fixing all those.. i think it would have taken a long time for me to figure all that out
2018-11-29T13:42:21  <the-t-in-rtf> just spend a few months arm-deep in a few coverage and testing tools and it'll all make sense
2018-11-29T13:42:27  <Justin_o> haha
2018-11-29T13:42:29  <the-t-in-rtf> or chat with me and save your time
2018-11-29T13:42:39  <Justin_o> i prefer the latter
2018-11-29T13:43:15  <the-t-in-rtf> honestly I was relieved it wasn't a thorny exclusions problem
2018-11-29T13:43:23  <the-t-in-rtf> did you get anywhere on the infusion linting settings?
2018-11-29T13:47:49  <Justin_o> well sort of.. according to this grunt documentation about globbing patterns, it seems i should have been able to put the file back in. However, that didn't work. https://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns
2018-11-29T13:48:16  <Justin_o> so rather than list out all of the lib directories, which would be annoying to maintain, i just moved the json dependency file up one level
2018-11-29T13:48:36  <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/946/files
2018-11-29T13:49:31  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, friend
2018-11-29T13:49:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I spent forever breaking us free of the tyranny of grunt globbing
2018-11-29T13:49:59  <the-t-in-rtf> it doesn't work that way any more at least with regards to gpii-grunt-lint-all
2018-11-29T13:50:14  <the-t-in-rtf> the outcome is a good one, though
2018-11-29T13:50:34  <the-t-in-rtf> that seems like the right choice anyway.
2018-11-29T13:50:35  <Justin_o> right, you did all those speed improvements recently
2018-11-29T13:50:55  <Justin_o> yah, it didn't really need to be in that directory, i just liked keeping things together.

2018-11-29T13:58:37  <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: would one of you be able to give this small PR a review. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/946 It seems we missed linting one of the json dependency files and of course it had a linting issue, so we can't build Infusion at the moment.
2018-11-29T14:15:24  <cindyli> Justin_o: where can i find the description of the problem this pull request wants to fix
2018-11-29T14:15:55  <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry, it was just an add on because it was a bug created by the previous merge PR for that JIRA
2018-11-29T14:16:16  <cindyli> ok
2018-11-29T14:16:34  <Justin_o> cindyli: I believe you should see the issue by running "grunt buildDists" on master

2018-11-29T14:54:39  <Justin_o> cindyli: just looking through things.. there currently aren't any json files in under the lib directory, so potentially we could just not have the exclusion
2018-11-29T14:58:30  <cindyli> ya, i noticed that too.
2018-11-29T14:59:43  <cindyli> though it was there to prevent someone drops a lib with json files
2018-11-29T15:00:25  <cindyli> the exclusion of "!./src/lib/**/*.json" still doesn't work for me after running "rm -rf node_modules/; rm package-lock.json; npm install"
2018-11-29T15:09:24  <Justin_o> cindyli: so you add a json file to the lib directory and it tries to lint it?
