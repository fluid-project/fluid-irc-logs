2020-08-24T13:49:29  <gtirloni> zoom outage -- https://status.zoom.us/
2020-08-24T14:54:17  <gmoss> Affects the UK and parts of the US, apparently: https://downdetector.com/status/zoom/map/
2020-08-24T16:12:56  <dogeman> greatislander Regarding https://github.com/sachin10101998/fluidic-11ty/blob/master/src/index.html , the index page has no content, therefore it doesn't render anything. This is not because the extension is html,but because the content which you see is just a comment in markdown and hence it's not rendered.
2020-08-24T16:13:31  <dogeman> I intentionally didn't add anything to the index page so that someone who starts building a site using the starter kit, doesn't have to remove anything from index page
2020-08-24T16:15:29  <dogeman> 11ty processes both HTML and md extension files in a similar way.
2020-08-24T16:15:53  <dogeman> I'm talking about this issue: https://github.com/sachin10101998/fluidic-11ty/issues/1
2020-08-24T16:42:12  <greatislander> Hi dogeman, thanks for the explanation. However when I removed your sample content, the same issue occurred. Try changing this line:
2020-08-24T16:42:16  <greatislander> ```
2020-08-24T16:42:16  <greatislander> [//]: # "Create the index page by writing the content of index in markdown here. Remove this comment before you start editing"
2020-08-24T16:42:16  <greatislander> ```
2020-08-24T16:42:19  <greatislander> to this:
2020-08-24T16:42:35  <greatislander> ```
2020-08-24T16:42:35  <greatislander> This should be a paragraph with _italics_.
2020-08-24T16:42:35  <greatislander> ```
2020-08-24T16:43:06  <greatislander> Appears in the browser like this:

2020-08-24T16:44:35  <greatislander> If I change the extension to md

2020-08-24T16:45:19  <greatislander> dogeman, can you try those steps and see what happens for you?
2020-08-24T16:49:18  <dogeman> sure, hold on
2020-08-24T16:58:00  <dogeman> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/nE76OlMa/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-24%20at%201.42.58%20PM.png
2020-08-24T16:58:06  <dogeman> it appears like this if i change it to md
2020-08-24T17:01:59  <greatislander> Can you share the full contents of your index.md file?

2020-08-24T17:13:24  <gmoss> dogeman: you may have to stop and rebuild the site for the changes to appear
2020-08-24T17:20:19  <dogeman> yes workingnow
2020-08-24T17:20:25  <dogeman> made the changes in the kit too
2020-08-24T17:33:53  <dogeman> gmoss jhung will we be merging the floe andfluid pr today?
2020-08-24T17:38:47  <jhung> I've been sick a few days and haven't been able to finish my review. I am working on the review today. Please continue to be patient. :)
2020-08-24T17:38:59  <jhung> ^ dogeman
2020-08-24T17:46:12  <dogeman> sure jhung. not a problem
2020-08-24T18:06:42  <gmoss> gtirloni: to confirm the CI situation for FLOE and Fluid Project sites, since you removed the web hooks, it shouldn't trigger Jenkins when we merge in dogeman's pull requests, right?
2020-08-24T18:23:50  <jhung> dogeman I left some comments.
2020-08-24T18:24:39  <dogeman> where jhung
2020-08-24T18:24:51  <jhung> fluidproject.org PR dogeman
2020-08-24T18:24:58  <dogeman> alright
2020-08-24T18:31:24  <dogeman> jhung i recreated the npm i ,npm run cleanall and I do not see any error
2020-08-24T18:34:08  <jhung> dogeman hmmm I wonder if it's a Windows specific problem. For now, I'll file a new bug so it can be debugged later.
2020-08-24T18:36:47  <dogeman> alright
2020-08-24T19:08:48  <jhung> dogeman and gmoss - I have no more comments for the Fluidproject.org PR. It should be ready for deploy testing.
2020-08-24T19:09:17  <dogeman> About time :D
2020-08-24T19:09:37  <jhung> :D Thanks for all your hard work and patience dogeman!
2020-08-24T19:10:12  <dogeman> Not a problem. It's exciting
2020-08-24T19:12:53  <gmoss> jhung: awesome! thanks for giving it a look :)
2020-08-24T19:12:53  <gmoss> dogeman: congrats!
2020-08-24T19:13:16  <dogeman> Thanks gmoss. :D
2020-08-24T19:14:41  <jhung> I'm heading offline. I'll catch up on the conversation tomorrow.
2020-08-24T19:23:17  <dogeman> gmoss i made the required changes in floe project PR too.
2020-08-24T19:23:27  <gmoss> dogeman: awesome, I'll take a look
2020-08-24T19:24:19  <dogeman> thanks
2020-08-24T19:25:15  <gmoss> dogeman: for the link that had a missing space, it was actually the one before: "Forces and Motion Basics"
2020-08-24T19:26:52  <gmoss> dogeman: there are a couple of items from my review on Thursday that still need to be addressed, I left comments on those
2020-08-24T19:27:31  <dogeman> checking them
2020-08-24T19:30:13  <dogeman> gmoss there is already a space before "forces and Motion basics"
2020-08-24T19:30:22  <dogeman> could you point out the linenumber where it is needed"
2020-08-24T19:32:08  <gmoss> dogeman: sure. This is a little confusing since there are two links with those words as the title. it's line  9
2020-08-24T19:33:32  <gtirloni> gmoss: correct , it shouldn't triggrer any deploys
2020-08-24T19:33:35  <dogeman> found it
2020-08-24T19:34:00  <gmoss> gtirloni: excellent, thanks :) I forgot that you'd said something to that effect on the Fluid Project PR
2020-08-24T19:42:43  <dogeman> gmoss i addressed the comments and made required changes
2020-08-24T19:46:37  <gmoss> dogeman: great, thanks for getting those done so quickly
2020-08-24T19:47:33  <dogeman> not a problem
2020-08-24T20:27:50  <sbates> Bosmon: cool if I remove myself as the assignee of https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5304 ?
2020-08-24T20:28:04  <Bosmon> Oh sure, sorry!
2020-08-24T20:28:13  <sbates> I'll keep watching :)
