2018-11-06T12:27:31  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Cheers for the gpii-express-user release!
2018-11-06T12:27:39  <the-t-in-rtf> you're welcome
2018-11-06T12:28:14  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, not sure what your laptop does and doesn't have, is Vidyo OK this time, or would you prefer something else?
2018-11-06T12:29:57  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.177.167> has joined #fluid-work
2018-11-06T12:33:59  <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: is the meeting on today?
2018-11-06T12:34:08  <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2018-11-06T12:34:29  <the-t-in-rtf> let's give it five minutes to see if @Bosmon is available
2018-11-06T12:35:00  <sgithens> He's in Boston
2018-11-06T12:35:15  <sgithens> Was he planning on making it the-t-in-rtf ?
2018-11-06T12:35:34  <the-t-in-rtf> I know, he mentioned it but didn't say whether that meant he couldn't attend.
2018-11-06T12:35:53  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, it's 7:30 in boston and 12:30 body tiime
2018-11-06T12:35:55  <the-t-in-rtf> time
2018-11-06T12:36:04  <the-t-in-rtf> chances are we might need to wait
2018-11-06T12:36:39  <sgithens> just as a background, the reason for this is that a number of important tests were failing on pouchdb in CI right?
2018-11-06T12:39:34  <cindyli> sgithens: the other reason is to discuss this pull request https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/pull/21 that replaces pouchdb for running node tests with couchdb in a docker container
2018-11-06T12:47:18  <the-t-in-rtf> they're related, but we should wait.
2018-11-06T12:47:38  <the-t-in-rtf> The harness will be pretty solid by the time Antranig is available again, I'll bump to next Tuesday.
2018-11-06T12:48:00  <the-t-in-rtf> the good news is that I already restored most of what you'd need to keep using the "persistent" express-pouchdb
2018-11-06T12:48:03  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: cool, thanks
2018-11-06T12:48:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I hope you get up this early anyway, @cindyli
2018-11-06T12:48:19  <the-t-in-rtf> (and @sgithens)
2018-11-06T12:48:39  <sgithens> will there be a toggle or something in the config to go between couch and pouch or will it pretty much be couch going forward?
2018-11-06T12:48:43  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: hahahaha
2018-11-06T12:48:52  <sgithens> is only an hour earlier than I ususlaly wake up
2018-11-06T12:56:54  <the-t-in-rtf> well, we should discuss, my thinking was, only couch
2018-11-06T12:56:59  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@198.52.177.167> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2018-11-06T12:57:14  <the-t-in-rtf> in my testing, I found at least one key difference between the pouch and couch APIs that might have bit us pretty hard
2018-11-06T12:57:35  <the-t-in-rtf> the pouch APIs allowed DELETE requests that modern Couch would reject
2018-11-06T12:57:45  <the-t-in-rtf> so we think we're testing deletes, but we're not really
2018-11-06T12:57:51  <sgithens> huh
2018-11-06T12:57:52  <the-t-in-rtf> that, and the maintenance and unreliability are big.
2018-11-06T12:58:01  <sgithens> what part of the DELETE request was different?
2018-11-06T12:58:05  <sgithens> sure
2018-11-06T12:58:09  <the-t-in-rtf> Couch requires a _rev value
2018-11-06T12:58:15  <sgithens> oof
2018-11-06T12:58:22  <the-t-in-rtf> Pouch is like, sure, I'll delete it with just an ID.
2018-11-06T12:58:52  <sgithens> I guess the "really cool factor" that there is a javascript implementation of the datastore is not as important :p
2018-11-06T12:59:26  <sgithens> Although it would be nice to keep the gpii pouch modules sort of around in case we ever wanted to make an embedded infusion project with them
2018-11-06T12:59:26  <the-t-in-rtf> well, it's something to discuss
2018-11-06T12:59:53  <sgithens> but yeah, it's like using mysql vs sqlite for testing
2018-11-06T13:00:12  <sgithens> You can use sqllite for a while, but eventually you find all these holes that you need to test on the real thing for
2018-11-06T13:00:33  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, unless your real datastore is sqlite
2018-11-06T13:00:38  <the-t-in-rtf> (happens a lot on Android)
2018-11-06T13:00:58  <sgithens> aha
2018-11-06T13:04:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I'm just down to the failure mode tests on the docker pull, it should be really ready to discuss by Tuesday.  Sadly I'm not available on Thursday, but I suspect Boz will either not be back or be recovering.
2018-11-06T13:04:58  <sgithens> I think the conf is still going on then
2018-11-06T13:05:10  <sgithens> maybe not
2018-11-06T13:05:15  <sgithens> but yeah, best for tuesday
2018-11-06T13:06:47  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: I might have another go at upgrading my version of gpii-handlebars today, so might ping you about that for tomorrow
2018-11-06T13:07:07  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds good

2018-11-06T18:34:32  <the-t-in-rtf> there were a couple of variations in the last two weeks.
2018-11-06T18:34:44  <the-t-in-rtf> the most recent was a cleanup and corrupt directory failure
2018-11-06T18:34:52  <the-t-in-rtf> which is ~probably~ the one you mean
2018-11-06T18:35:03  <the-t-in-rtf> there is a new dev release of gpii-pouchdb that addresses it
2018-11-06T18:35:49  <the-t-in-rtf> there was a previous discussion about not reusing temp dirs between runs, but the fix for that doesn't help with the second problem.
2018-11-06T18:36:31  <the-t-in-rtf> and the fix for the second problem should also fix the first, as even  "common" subdir is totally cleaned out
2018-11-06T18:37:02  <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens ^^^
2018-11-06T18:37:54  <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Yeah, I noticed one of cindy's recent PR's was passing so I updated my pouchdb to the version in her diff and just pushed it up, will see if it passes in a few minutes
2018-11-06T18:38:22  <the-t-in-rtf> npm info gpii-pouchdb versions would let you know if you have the fix I made to help stegru last week
2018-11-06T18:38:54  <sgithens> I bumped up to 1.0.13-dev.20181102T155124Z.9120d82

2018-11-06T19:20:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: Hello, I'm working on the syllabification preference which will separate words into their syllables by adding a separation character. I'm trying to get this to play nice with the text-to-speech preference. We don't want it to read out the separator so we need to do some clean up before it gets passed in. I'm first looking at the page level text-to-speech and have managed to get things working even with the
2018-11-06T19:20:01  <Justin_o> highlighting as it reads. However, i had to explicitly do the clean up in the orator component. What I really want is to only have the cleanup run if syllabification is enabled. That way we don't accidentally remove a character that is supposed to be part of the text.
2018-11-06T19:21:33  <Justin_o> i'm not sure if there is something that can dynamically add/remove configuration based on the state of another component
2018-11-06T19:23:21  <Justin_o> actually i guess the transformation function can check the state, so i just need to push the configuration from one enactor to another, and only if they are both actually their

2018-11-06T20:31:21  <Justin_o> simonjb: I wonder if you could help with something. I need to setup configuration between two components but only if they are both present. You can see my comments to Bosmon above for some more details
2018-11-06T20:31:55  <Justin_o> basically though i need to hook up some configuration to get the text to speech and syllabification working nicely together if they are both enabled.
2018-11-06T20:32:20  <Justin_o> and of course their are cases where both, one or none are even available as preferences in a given prefs editor
2018-11-06T20:34:00  <simonjb> Justin_o: reading...
2018-11-06T20:35:28  <simonjb> Justin_o: do you want to chat on vidyo so we can step through code?
2018-11-06T20:36:32  <Justin_o> simonjb: sure, can you join my room. cindyli will join as well
