2019-06-18T08:16:53  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds good, @sgithens.
2019-06-18T08:17:05  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I am encountering a weird behaviour here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-json-schema/blob/master/src/js/common/schemaValidatedComponent.js#L62
2019-06-18T08:17:15  <the-t-in-rtf> whatever I add as a second argument becomes a literal zero.
2019-06-18T08:17:30  <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to add the global validator there
2019-06-18T08:18:01  <the-t-in-rtf> I thought at first it was the wrong part of the lifecycle, but whether I put {that} or {gpii.schema.validator} as the second argument, it ends up being a literal zero
2019-06-18T08:18:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I will test a few things and make a gist for you to try shortly
2019-06-18T08:23:28  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - workflows are not invokers
2019-06-18T08:23:41  <Bosmon> The framework can't afford any indirection here, it is a highly performance critical corner
2019-06-18T08:25:11  <Bosmon> You get funcName and that's it
2019-06-18T08:29:54  <the-t-in-rtf> and that apparently?
2019-06-18T08:29:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess that is hard coded
2019-06-18T08:30:13  <the-t-in-rtf> what's crazy is that whatever I put in args, "{that}" is the only thing passed
2019-06-18T08:30:19  <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe not crazy, just unexpected
2019-06-18T08:34:16  <the-t-in-rtf> so, this means that schema-validated components will have their own little uncached setup and that each instance of the component won't benefit from the caching
2019-06-18T08:34:35  <the-t-in-rtf> it's fine, it just means we should avoid using schema-validated components per request
2019-06-18T08:35:19  <the-t-in-rtf> or anything similar

2019-06-18T08:40:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll add a little note there about the args being for illustration purposes only.
2019-06-18T08:40:56  <the-t-in-rtf> mainly as an aid to my flimsy memory
2019-06-18T08:41:12  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, thanks, I have what I need.
2019-06-18T08:41:48  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - best just not to write them at all, lest it encourage others to believe they are resolved .....
2019-06-18T08:57:27  <the-t-in-rtf> the initial args block made it past the review, but yes, it only confused me later on
2019-06-18T08:57:35  <the-t-in-rtf> if we purge it now only one person is confused
2019-06-18T09:00:38  <the-t-in-rtf> and with luck even I'll forget the misinformation
2019-06-18T09:32:22  <the-t-in-rtf> amazingly I managed to rewrite the middleware without any goofs on the first pass
2019-06-18T09:32:37  <the-t-in-rtf> just tidying up the browser tests then I'll have something for you to look at, @Bosmon
2019-06-18T09:33:11  <the-t-in-rtf> direct usage of the validation functions will change significantly, but as far as universal is concerned, all of the replacements are "drop in" as requested
2019-06-18T09:33:48  <the-t-in-rtf> since only I am directly using the validation functions, we can probably do a dot 1 release for this.
2019-06-18T09:49:38  <the-t-in-rtf> just the docs left, I'll put it in for you to review while you're still likely to have your morning tea to spit out in outrage

2019-06-18T10:01:41  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-json-schema/pull/16
2019-06-18T10:41:07  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - if we do want to go back to hashing someday, it looks like this one might be the most promising - https://github.com/tjwebb/fnv-plus/blob/master/index.js#L1060
2019-06-18T10:41:20  <Bosmon> It's only 30 lines of code and generates a 128-bit hash space
2019-06-18T10:41:40  <Bosmon> Which puts all collisions firmly into the "meteor hitting your house" territory
2019-06-18T10:42:53  <the-t-in-rtf> we're not going back, the pull already has hashing
2019-06-18T10:43:02  <the-t-in-rtf> but I can improve the hashing function, certainly
2019-06-18T10:43:05  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - my review comment recommended that it be removed
2019-06-18T10:43:13  <the-t-in-rtf> ah
2019-06-18T10:43:16  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, working on the docs
2019-06-18T10:44:30  <Bosmon> Simplest for now if "the hash function" is simply JSON.stringify
2019-06-18T10:50:56  <the-t-in-rtf> uh, or rather our version
2019-06-18T10:51:03  <the-t-in-rtf> the one that preserves the order
2019-06-18T10:51:05  <Bosmon> Yes, that one
2019-06-18T10:52:13  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, let me finish proofreading the docs and I'll look at the feedback.
2019-06-18T11:22:53  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, done.
2019-06-18T11:23:31  <the-t-in-rtf> The test failure was a timing issue with the VM, the stringify function took an average of .5ms when the cutoff was .4ms
2019-06-18T11:23:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I increased the cutoff to 1ms
2019-06-18T11:43:39  <the-t-in-rtf> It's already past the tests on the latest build, just waiting for cleanup.
2019-06-18T11:43:40  <the-t-in-rtf> ah, there it is.
