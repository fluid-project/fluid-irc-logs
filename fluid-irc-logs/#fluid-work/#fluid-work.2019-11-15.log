2019-11-15T00:29:14  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that's good news :) so we can make them immutable now?
2019-11-15T00:30:39  <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks like it : P
2019-11-15T00:30:57  <Bosmon> Just means that gmoss has potentially yet more cruft to clean up in his update : P
2019-11-15T00:31:32  <Justin_o> sgithens: sorry, I had to step away for a while. Regarding vagrant. I upgraded my office machine to Catalina and did a clean install. I haven't had any issue with vagrant/virutalbox since then, but haven't used it much yet. I'm not in the office that much right now.
2019-11-15T00:33:16  <Justin_o> I'm not sure if the scripts require virtual box, I haven't really set them up. the-t-in-rtf might know better.
2019-11-15T00:34:01  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully gmoss doesn't have too many spots that manipulate the options. I think the localization stuff did, but I'm not sure that's in use at the moment anyways.
2019-11-15T00:34:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm going to go back to FLUID-6420.  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/967
2019-11-15T00:36:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was thinking about two approaches, 1) try to merge fluid.prefs.create with fluid.prefs.builder so that there is only one component. A simple test of this didn't work, so not sure how hard it would be 2) convert the primaryBuilder, auxBuilder, and builder into functions. With as little changes as possible to get to a working solution. Again not sure how long this would take.
2019-11-15T00:37:09  <Bosmon> I guess I need to remind myself why there are two things in the first place : P
2019-11-15T00:37:10  <Justin_o> Bosmon:  the third option would be. your suggestion of grade linkage, although I'm not sure how that would work for making UIO easily configurable. As you'd still need to run fluid.prefs.create in addition to instantiating UIO. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding how that would work.
2019-11-15T00:38:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: all of the various builder things are infusion components. in my rework to try to make things more configurable, in terms of preferences used, ended up using fluid.prefs.builder as a function inside of an invoker of the fluid.prefs.create component
2019-11-15T00:39:03  <Justin_o> which broke something in the new framework
2019-11-15T00:41:23  <Bosmon> Oh yes
2019-11-15T00:41:26  <Bosmon> I remember that now : P
2019-11-15T00:59:21  <Justin_o> Bosmon: any thoughts on my options above?
2019-11-15T01:00:16  <Bosmon> Probably too late for me to think about this clearly
2019-11-15T01:00:30  <Bosmon> I still don't recall the separate functions of the two things : P
2019-11-15T01:00:43  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also I wonder if we should look more into https://github.com/features/actions given the random failures of Jenkins and that it looks like it also supports runners on macOS; which would probably be needed for Christopher's work
2019-11-15T01:01:15  <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem, if you think of anything tomorrow feel free to let me know.. I'm heading offline now too, and will only be on briefly tomorrow
