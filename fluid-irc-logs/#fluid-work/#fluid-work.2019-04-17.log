2019-04-17T18:03:15  <sgithens> Bosmon: What would you call the thing that comes back from `that.dom.locate`? It shows up as a jQuery.fn.init array of regular Dom nodes.
2019-04-17T18:03:29  <sgithens> I'm just trying to document some function params

2019-04-17T18:07:37  <sgithens> would it be documented as an {Array} even though it has some extra keys that are not integers
2019-04-17T18:09:24  <colinclark> sgithens: That would be a {jQuery}, I believe

2019-04-17T18:17:33  <colinclark> yeah, itâ€™s a jQuery object
2019-04-17T18:18:21  <colinclark> and these are objects that have array-like semantics

2019-04-17T18:50:31  <gmoss> fluid-everyone: does anyone know, off the top of their head, if there's an fluid API function that will return a component if i pass in a CSS selector? something like locate() but instead of a selector name, it's the selector proper
2019-04-17T18:50:59  <gmoss> I poked around the docs and couldn't find anything that fit the bill, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place
2019-04-17T18:52:36  <gmoss> *this would, of course, only apply to viewComponents
2019-04-17T18:52:46  <gmoss> I think I may have a solution, but I'm still curious :)

2019-04-17T19:38:47  <Bosmon> gmoss - if you include FluidViewDebugging.js, there will activate the "viewMapper" defined here - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidViewDebugging.js#L574
2019-04-17T19:39:46  <Bosmon> This will then include a constantly updated member "domIdToEntry" which maps ids of DOM elements to their corresponding view component
2019-04-17T19:40:06  <Bosmon> Naturally you don't need the whole machinery of this file just for this feature : P
2019-04-17T19:40:11  <Bosmon> What was the solution you were thinking of?

2019-04-17T19:41:08  <gmoss> It may do the trick! I've rethought my approach in a way that is less flexible (I'm adding tests so I feel this is a reasonable compromise), but if things get unwieldy I may end up using this viewMapper
2019-04-17T19:41:13  <gmoss> thanks Bosmon :)

2019-04-17T19:41:51  <Bosmon> gmoss - what feature are you working on?
2019-04-17T19:44:56  <gmoss> Bosmon: in the storytelling tool, I've added some model relays to filter out empty story blocks, and I'd like to test out adding, editing and removing these blocks. the blocks themselves are handled by our dynamicViewComponentManager component, which we had intended one day to be integrated into infusion. When a new view component is added, it returns the CSS class for this view component's container, but what I really
2019-04-17T19:44:56  <gmoss> wanted to pass to my listener in the test sequence was a reference to the component itself. However, given that I'm the one manipulating the components directly and expecting certain values, I feel it isn't too hacky to address the collection directly

2019-04-17T19:45:18  <gmoss> Bosmon: stop me if any of that causes concern haha
2019-04-17T19:47:15  <gmoss> Bosmon: I realize now that this returning of the CSS class is something that only happens in the test component, and is not in fact used by anything. I will adjust it to return a reference to the component instead.

2019-04-17T20:33:24  <Bosmon> gmoss yes, seems odd to expect the CSS class to somehow uniquely identify the component
