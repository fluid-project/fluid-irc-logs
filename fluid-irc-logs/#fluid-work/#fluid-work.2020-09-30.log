2020-09-30T15:10:32  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: the standup room URL has changed. The new URL is included in the calendar event.
2020-09-30T15:48:21  <Bosmon> Celebrating, on this auspicious day, the 2.0.0 release of Kettle :)
2020-09-30T15:48:22  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/History.md
2020-09-30T15:49:01  <Bosmon> There's a new matching release of Infusion from the FLUID-6145 for anyone to try out who is interested - 3.0.0-dev.20200930T151056Z.d0b9e348d.FLUID-6145
2020-09-30T15:49:21  <sgithens> Bosmon: Congratulations!
2020-09-30T15:49:51  <Bosmon> The main updates are a rationalised fluid.dataSource infrastructure across the two projects, and an improved implementation of fluid.containerRenderingView and fluid.templateRenderingView anticipating the upcoming renderer
2020-09-30T16:19:27  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I've updated the standup room passcode again. The calendar and wiki links have been updated.
2020-09-30T16:20:18  <clown> again, Justin_o ???
2020-09-30T16:20:20  <clown> ;-)
2020-09-30T16:21:25  <Justin_o> yes.. but hopefully this is the last time :)
2020-09-30T16:25:22  <Bosmon> cindyli - so I've completed my work on giving a build to the preliminary viz and published a 0.0.1 release of it to npm under fluid-covid-map-viz
2020-09-30T16:25:43  <Bosmon> It should be fairly easy for us from here to integrate it into your "map" branch of the wecount website
2020-09-30T16:29:17  <Justin_o> Bosmon: have you started pushing data to GitHub, was just thinking about a similar approach for a log bot for our chat rooms. And then using that to generate a static site for viewing the logs.
2020-09-30T16:29:35  <Justin_o> greatislander, gtirloni, colinclark^
2020-09-30T16:29:57  <greatislander> I like that idea Justin_o
2020-09-30T16:30:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - we have a data repository yes
2020-09-30T16:31:20  <Justin_o> Bosmon: curious about the api use and structure of the data, commits, and etc.
2020-09-30T16:31:23  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks :)
2020-09-30T16:31:48  <Justin_o> cindyli, danayo, michelled: are you available to meet for storytelling?
2020-09-30T16:32:00  <cindyli> yes, Justin_o
2020-09-30T16:32:03  <danayo> yes
2020-09-30T17:08:56  <Bosmon> Justin_o - we have no API use as yet, we just have a bunch fo CSV files in a repository :)
2020-09-30T17:32:22  <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay, so no automated mechanism for publishing them to that repo
2020-09-30T17:32:23  <Justin_o> ?
2020-09-30T17:35:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I suppose it doesn't need to use the api anyways, if it's just pushing commits, that's just git anyways.
2020-09-30T17:37:00  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip, Teddy___: Bosmon's map demo is up on the wecount site - https://deploy-preview-415--wecount.netlify.app/map/ ;)
2020-09-30T17:43:25  <Teddy___> cindyli: nice
2020-09-30T17:44:20  <cindyli> Bosmon, philip, Teddy___: can you take a look at my data repo pull request when you have a chance - https://github.com/inclusive-design/covid-assessment-centres/pull/4
2020-09-30T17:44:41  <cindyli> Teddy___: you haven't accepted the invite to this data repo so i cannot set you as a reviewer
2020-09-30T17:45:53  <Teddy___> cindyli: sorry I did not see the invite in GitHub
2020-09-30T17:49:13  <cindyli> Teddy___: can you check ur junk mail. i will figure out how to resend invites later
