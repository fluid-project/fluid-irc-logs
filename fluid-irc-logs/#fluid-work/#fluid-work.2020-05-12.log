2020-05-12T10:01:13  <jhernandez> not urgent
2020-05-12T10:01:32  <the-t-in-rtf> morning
2020-05-12T10:01:35  <jhernandez> but I'm having a problem when running the tests in gpii-app over node12
2020-05-12T10:01:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I'll be making lunch in a few, but I'm around
2020-05-12T10:01:46  <jhernandez> sure
2020-05-12T10:02:01  <the-t-in-rtf> go on
2020-05-12T10:02:02  <jhernandez> I'm getting a "Error: Cannot find module '\\vboxsvr\vagrant\instrumented\node_modules\infusion\src\module\fluid.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry"
2020-05-12T10:02:32  <the-t-in-rtf> Yeah, I'm starting to sense why you came looking for me.
2020-05-12T10:02:36  <jhernandez> I checked and yeah, fluid.js is not there
2020-05-12T10:02:39  <jhernandez> :P
2020-05-12T10:02:56  <the-t-in-rtf> first question, where are you running the tests from?
2020-05-12T10:02:58  <jhernandez> not aware of all the magic behind the curtains

2020-05-12T10:03:20  <jhernandez> and yeah, you can see the full failure here: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/1098/console
2020-05-12T10:03:31  <jhernandez> it's from the node/electron update PR
2020-05-12T10:03:36  <the-t-in-rtf> so, are you running npm test, or just an individual npm script?
2020-05-12T10:03:41  <the-t-in-rtf> ah
2020-05-12T10:03:43  <jhernandez> npm test
2020-05-12T10:03:59  <the-t-in-rtf> that will help me get more context, thanks
2020-05-12T10:04:13  <the-t-in-rtf> I ask about that because the instrumentation should be wired into pretest
2020-05-12T10:04:23  <jhernandez> I'm getting different failures when running the noCoverage script - but not that one, so I assume it's something weird going on
2020-05-12T10:05:10  <the-t-in-rtf> what happens when you run "node tests/lib/instrumentSource.js" locally?
2020-05-12T10:05:54  <jhernandez> oh, I see, I was going to exactly test that :P
2020-05-12T10:07:58  <jhernandez> taking its time, my gpii-app folder is huge :P

2020-05-12T10:11:32  <jhernandez> :(
2020-05-12T10:13:25  <jhernandez> so, as I said earlier, not urgent - but I guess that we should take a closer look soon
2020-05-12T10:13:46  <the-t-in-rtf> you are very much in luck
2020-05-12T10:13:59  <the-t-in-rtf> day one with schools open I took a little time for myself and the house
2020-05-12T10:14:08  <the-t-in-rtf> day two I am spoiling for a few bugs to squish
2020-05-12T10:14:31  <the-t-in-rtf> spinning up a VM for gpii-testem, which is where I suspect we'll find the issue
2020-05-12T10:14:48  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it wasn't ready for the node update
2020-05-12T10:15:12  <the-t-in-rtf> I will work my way towards you from there

2020-05-12T12:26:11  <the-t-in-rtf> so, @jhernandez, I'm 99% sure it's just a matter of adjusting what node_modules material is copied into instrumented
2020-05-12T12:26:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I was working on a nuanced fix, but it's similar errors all the way down
2020-05-12T12:26:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I am working on a blunter approach now

2020-05-12T12:32:39  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez we should talk before I go
2020-05-12T12:32:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I tried copying literally everything from node_modules into the instrumented dir and got to another type of error altogether
2020-05-12T12:33:11  <the-t-in-rtf> just wanted to confirm whether the tests have been verified working without instrumentation
2020-05-12T12:36:19  <the-t-in-rtf> looks like they do
2020-05-12T12:42:19  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, or maybe not
2020-05-12T12:42:46  <the-t-in-rtf> my advice is to confirm that npm run test:psp:noCoverage works
2020-05-12T12:42:54  <the-t-in-rtf> I can keep looking at the coverage issues
2020-05-12T12:52:55  <jhernandez> ok ok
2020-05-12T12:54:10  <jhernandez> so, noCoverage works but there are some failing tests, completely unrelated to the instrumented stuff but related to the electron update I'd say
2020-05-12T12:54:50  <jhernandez> for those I can fix by myself and/or ask HA for help
2020-05-12T12:55:07  <Bosmon> Hey stegru - so for some reason I get test failures in the metrics even just with universal master against windows master now
2020-05-12T12:55:27  <Bosmon> If I update gpii-windows to gpii-universal of 0.3.0-dev.20200511T123345Z.a793adf, I get the standard failure that it can't find the log file to read
2020-05-12T12:55:29  <Bosmon> Any ideas?
2020-05-12T12:55:46  <stegru> yeh, Bosmon.. it;s a change i;ve made to universal.. working on i t now

2020-05-12T18:15:45  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-05-12T18:24:38  <cindyli> Bosmon: when adding UIO to the WeCount website, one requirement is to remove "text size" preference from UIO. Justin_o pointed out it's easier to do so with FLUID-6145 branch - https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-6145/demos/prefsFramework/index.html#L103 than modifying starterSchema in the master branch. as WeCount website will pull in infusion as a npm dependency. by looking at the latest dev release of the infusion pack
2020-05-12T18:24:38  <cindyli>  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion, it was built from your FLUID-6148 branch that doesn't have all UIO changes in the FLUID-6145. i wonder if you can bring your FLUID-6145 up to date by merging in FLUID-6148 and publish a dev release from FLUID-6145? thanks.
2020-05-12T18:25:14  <michelled> cindyli: why is text size being removed?
2020-05-12T18:26:25  <cindyli> michelled: the text size creates a bunch of issues and it can be replaced by browser zoom in/out
2020-05-12T18:27:35  <cindyli> one major issue with increasing UIO text size is, it doesn't trigger the switch to mobile version but pushing enlarged text out of the viewport
2020-05-12T18:29:32  <cindyli> UIO+ has changed the implementation to use zoom in/out to increase text size because it has more permission as a browser extension. but the on-page UIO doesn't have this privilege with pure javascript
