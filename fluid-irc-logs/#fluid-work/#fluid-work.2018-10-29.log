2018-10-29T14:28:18  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, it's been a while, any reason not to use the "prioritised pseudo-events as promise chain" pattern now?
2018-10-29T14:33:52  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-testem/blob/master/src/js/testem-component.js#L37
2018-10-29T14:34:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Like I did there.
2018-10-29T14:35:41  <the-t-in-rtf> The docs still say that the function is part of an API, but I thought I'd ask in case there's a better/newer way to chain events in sequence.
2018-10-29T14:35:50  <the-t-in-rtf> I'
2018-10-29T14:36:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm using it for the lifecycle of the docker based gpii-pouchdb test harness.
2018-10-29T14:37:03  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, it should be used wherever possible
2018-10-29T14:37:28  <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanks.
2018-10-29T14:37:35  <Bosmon> It's the most faithful incarnation that we currently have of our future "method combination" system which will replace and/or amalgamate events and invokers
