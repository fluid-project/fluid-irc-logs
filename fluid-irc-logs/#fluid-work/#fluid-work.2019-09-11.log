2019-09-11T14:44:35  <cindyli> gmoss: i made a review comment on Justin_o's sjrk pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/40#pullrequestreview-286308485, wonder if you have an idea of the present of the read-more container?
2019-09-11T14:52:19  <colinclark> simonjb, danielcho, michelled, avtar: As far as I know, we’re not having our weekly C2LC call with Bridges today because they’re in all-day meetings, but I was thinking it’d be great to meet up anyway if you’re all up for it.
2019-09-11T14:52:38  <avtar> sounds good
2019-09-11T14:52:59  <danielcho> colinclark: yeah sounds good to me too
2019-09-11T14:54:12  <colinclark> ok cool
2019-09-11T14:54:22  <colinclark> same time, then?
2019-09-11T14:55:22  <avtar> yup, 1:00 works for me
2019-09-11T14:55:23  <simonjb> yes, let's meet
2019-09-11T14:55:31  <simonjb> 1:00 is good for me also
2019-09-11T14:55:32  <danielcho> yeah I am okay with the time
2019-09-11T14:55:37  <simonjb> it's been a while!
2019-09-11T14:56:06  <danielcho> for sure!
2019-09-11T14:56:08  <avtar> actually
2019-09-11T14:56:15  <avtar> looks like there's an iteration meeting at 2:00
2019-09-11T14:57:38  <michelled> let's just meet at 1:00 and do the iteration meeting too at that time
2019-09-11T14:57:47  <simonjb> +1

2019-09-11T15:05:00  <gmoss> cindyli: I've left a reply on the pull request. There are a bunch of pieces of markup that were added during initial development of the tool (for layout testing) but never fully implemented, and then they were hidden as part of the initial launch of the tool. They can be removed without too much fuss. As I said on the PR, I can file a Jira to do this

2019-09-11T15:09:27  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss. it's a great idea to file a jira for a complete clean up. but for this read-more container, do you think it's possible to file a pull request against Justin_o's branch to remove it since it's discovered here and i hope it won't slip off our mind. my search shows there are only 3 such containers that need to be removed
2019-09-11T15:12:31  <Justin_o> cindyli: did you want me to just remove them, if that's all it is
2019-09-11T15:13:16  <cindyli> Justin_o: yes, removing them is what I understood from gmoss' reply
2019-09-11T15:16:12  <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, will take a look at it now
2019-09-11T15:16:22  <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o

2019-09-11T15:28:16  <Justin_o> cindyli: the stuff for language and localization, but they may need to come back.
2019-09-11T15:30:09  <Justin_o> cindyli: I've removed the read-more and pushed that up
2019-09-11T15:30:37  <cindyli> cool. thanks, Justin_o.

2019-09-11T15:54:19  <gmoss> cindyli Justin_o: Indeed, the l10n things will come back at some point. there are other pieces separate from the read-more and the language that are a little crufty now. namely: the save-no-share button, the read-other-stories link, and the "preview" heading,
2019-09-11T15:55:47  <cindyli> gmoss: would be nice to clean them up
2019-09-11T15:56:01  <gmoss> cindyli: agreed. do you feel we should just take care of that now?
2019-09-11T15:56:18  <gmoss> in which case I'll do as you suggested
2019-09-11T15:56:49  <cindyli> gmoss: depending on priorities of you other jiras/works ;)
2019-09-11T15:57:11  <gmoss> cindyli: I think this would be a quick fix if I dispense with the overhead of creating a new Jira for the work
2019-09-11T15:57:44  <gmoss> and as you said earlier, it'll slip our minds if we don't capture it or take care of it now
2019-09-11T15:59:40  <cindyli> gmoss: i would say go for it if it doesn't distract you too much :)
2019-09-11T16:02:09  <gmoss> cindyli: going to timebox it to 30 minutes, if it takes any longer then I'm moving on regardless :)
2019-09-11T16:03:00  <cindyli> sounds perfect. thanks, gmoss

2019-09-11T20:21:24  <gmoss> cindyli: let me know if you'd like me to come over to your desk during your review
2019-09-11T20:21:34  <cindyli> sure
2019-09-11T20:23:01  <cindyli> gmoss: does this pull request cover like 10 sub jiras under 273?
2019-09-11T20:23:15  <gmoss> cindyli: that's correct
2019-09-11T20:23:20  <gmoss> 273 is an Epic
2019-09-11T20:23:41  <cindyli> man, it will take some time just for testing ...
2019-09-11T20:24:12  <gmoss> cindyli: I just noticed the link in my PR description is broken, fixing that. sorry for the huge number of Jiras! we figured one PR for all of them would be easier than a dozen small PR's
2019-09-11T20:24:18  <gmoss> in hindsight maybe that was foolish
2019-09-11T20:26:34  <cindyli> well, it's ok to have them in one pull. just ridiculous to expect it to be ready and merged today ;)

2019-09-11T21:11:40  <cindyli> gmoss: the sjrk server crashed more frequently on my local machine today, at page load
2019-09-11T21:12:06  <gmoss> cindyli: I've also noticed it crashing once or twice on my machine, but only when running tests in firefox. did you happen to save the crash log?
2019-09-11T21:13:43  <cindyli> gmoss: the crash is always from the kettle about accessing a component that has been destroyed
2019-09-11T21:14:17  <cindyli> https://pastebin.com/DcQ1523X
2019-09-11T21:14:39  <gmoss> cindyli: that's the same one I've been getting
2019-09-11T21:15:14  <gmoss> Justin_o and I were exploring this error a month or so ago, and we suspect it may be an issue in Kettle, though we're not sure as I wasn't able to find another site which runs on kettle in the same way
2019-09-11T21:15:28  <gmoss> at least, I wasn't able to find such a site before other work pulled me away from investigating this further
2019-09-11T21:16:08  <gmoss> we were also unable to reproduce it on Justin_o's machine when accessing from his machine (we could when he was hosting and I was accessing from mine), so it's good to know that it occurred for you too
2019-09-11T21:16:27  <gmoss> we had thought it was something specific to Windows requests but couldn't understand how that would be possible
2019-09-11T21:17:18  <gmoss> cindyli: I've seen this occur with older versions of the tool, so if it's any consolation I don't think it's a problem with the new code haha
2019-09-11T21:17:50  <cindyli> ok. good to know
