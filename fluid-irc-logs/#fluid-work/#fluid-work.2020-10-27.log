2020-10-27T13:26:15  <Justin_o> gtirloni: is this file needed? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/3c655d89adae8759ea22dcd689c14a5647cfd646
2020-10-27T13:26:45  <gtirloni> Justin_o: no, probably a mistake
2020-10-27T13:26:50  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2020-10-27T17:48:55  <klown[m]> fluid-everyone, using element/matrix to join #fluid-work on freenode:  test message
2020-10-27T17:49:55  * clown waves at klown, his dÃ¶ppelganger
2020-10-27T17:50:22  * klown[m] is having a slight identity crisis
2020-10-27T17:58:58  <Justin_o> klown[m]: hello
2020-10-27T18:01:18  <klown[m]> Hi Justin_o
2020-10-27T18:01:40  * klown[m] hearing chirps all over the place
2020-10-27T18:02:41  <Justin_o> klown[m]: :)
2020-10-27T18:32:30  <klown[m]> jhernandez sgithens stegru :  if you haven't heard, the IDRC is migrating away from IRC and using matrix instead.  See: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Matrix+Channel
2020-10-27T18:32:43  <klown[m]> Come join the party.
2020-10-27T18:33:36  <klown[m]> kasparnet ^
2020-10-27T18:38:49  <stegru> i'll think about it
2020-10-27T18:42:26  <klown[m]> fair enough, stegru
2020-10-27T18:49:04  <gmoss> more accurately, we're evaluating it :) but so far so good for most of us, I believe
2020-10-27T19:05:22  <stegru> it's not bad, used worse. it lacks the 90s nostalgia, however
2020-10-27T19:06:46  <sgithens> klown[m]: Oh, I knew we were investigating it. It's a done deal then?
2020-10-27T19:07:07  <sgithens> I've been meaning to install it for a while to pop in on the Purism Librem 5 forums
2020-10-27T19:07:27  <klown[m]> sgithens: as gmoss pointed out above, the word is "evaluating".
2020-10-27T19:07:45  <klown[m]> But, we've got some rooms set up and a lot of us are playing with the Element client.
2020-10-27T19:07:51  <sgithens> cool
2020-10-27T19:09:25  <gmoss> stegru sgithens: it would be great, if you're comfortable joining, to get the opinions of people who are perhaps less keen on the switch!
2020-10-27T19:09:40  <gmoss> it's no mIRC, that much is certain
2020-10-27T19:10:05  <stegru> i'm on it
2020-10-27T19:10:27  <sgithens> I'm keen, just lazy on setting up new accounts for things
2020-10-27T19:10:33  <gmoss> fair enough :)
2020-10-27T19:10:44  <klown[m]> > it's not bad, used worse. it lacks the 90s nostalgia, however
2020-10-27T19:10:44  <klown[m]> you youngsters.  I'm old enough to remember "talk". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_(software)
2020-10-27T19:11:51  <stegru> ahh, talk.. yeh, my grandad used to tell me about that
2020-10-27T19:12:02  <klown[m]> LOL
2020-10-27T19:12:35  <gmoss> back when speeds were measured in baud
2020-10-27T19:28:25  *** klown[m] is now known as clown[m]
2020-10-27T20:10:36  <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please test something for me from UIO. You can try this on any site that uses it, including the wecount site. Can you select a contrast theme and hit the enter key
2020-10-27T20:10:45  <cindyli> sure
2020-10-27T20:10:54  <cindyli> try what, Justin_o?
2020-10-27T20:10:58  <cindyli> the link?
2020-10-27T20:11:10  <Justin_o> want to go on a quick call actually?
2020-10-27T20:11:14  <cindyli> i see, use the wecount site
2020-10-27T20:11:15  <Justin_o> https://wecount.inclusivedesign.ca/
2020-10-27T20:11:44  <cindyli> nothing wrong after hitting the enter
2020-10-27T20:11:49  <cindyli> sure, a quick chat is good
2020-10-27T20:12:07  <cindyli> trying another browser
2020-10-27T20:12:51  <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2020-10-27T20:12:57  <cindyli> tried ff, chrome, safari, nothing wrong
2020-10-27T20:13:17  <cindyli> what do you see, Justin_o?
2020-10-27T20:13:36  <Justin_o> cindyli: want to jump on a call in the stand up room?
2020-10-27T20:13:41  <cindyli> sure
