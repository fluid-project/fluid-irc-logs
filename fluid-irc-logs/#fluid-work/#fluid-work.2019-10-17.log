2019-10-17T09:51:54  <jhernandez> Bosmon: morning
2019-10-17T09:51:56  <jhernandez> FYI
2019-10-17T09:52:13  <jhernandez> Alfredo and I are updating the CI windows vm to windows 1903
2019-10-17T09:52:34  <Bosmon> jhernandez - brilliant
2019-10-17T09:52:38  <Bosmon> What was the cause of the failure before?
2019-10-17T09:52:39  <jhernandez> but we need a couple of PRs to get in to actually get the tests passing again
2019-10-17T09:52:52  <jhernandez> we had 2 problems
2019-10-17T09:54:44  <jhernandez> 1- the language tests were failing due to a mismatch between the output that both 1803 and 1903 provide when we ask for available/installed languages
2019-10-17T09:54:57  <Bosmon> jhernandez - what does the mismatch look like?
2019-10-17T09:55:00  <Bosmon> Is there a JIRA? : P
2019-10-17T09:55:39  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/280/files
2019-10-17T09:56:12  <jhernandez> yes, https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4178
2019-10-17T09:56:20  <Bosmon> Wow, very wierd
2019-10-17T09:56:23  <Bosmon> What is this "Sysnative"?
2019-10-17T09:56:45  <Bosmon> And I guess whatever it is doesn't exist before windows 1903?
2019-10-17T09:57:35  <jhernandez> 2- there was a problem when referencing a win library during an edge-js call
2019-10-17T09:58:19  <jhernandez> about sysnative: https://www.samlogic.net/articles/sysnative-folder-64-bit-windows.htm
2019-10-17T09:59:03  <Bosmon> Oh wow
2019-10-17T09:59:07  <Bosmon> So it has existed in Windows 7
2019-10-17T09:59:29  <Bosmon> Let me try and verify this :)
2019-10-17T10:00:13  <Bosmon> I have to say that this is false
2019-10-17T10:00:15  <Bosmon> It does not exist : P
2019-10-17T10:00:32  <jhernandez> hahaha
2019-10-17T10:00:41  <Bosmon> Anyway, that isn't terribly relevant - I guess the big question is, are the changes in this pull backwards compatible to pre-1903 Windows 10?
2019-10-17T10:00:57  <stegru> yes, it does exist.. you just can't see it
2019-10-17T10:01:05  <jhernandez> Bosmon: nope, they aren't backwards compatible
2019-10-17T10:01:24  <jhernandez> and yeah, I was about to say the same as stegru
2019-10-17T10:01:32  <jhernandez> it's there, but you can't see it
2019-10-17T10:01:34  <jhernandez> :P
2019-10-17T10:02:26  <Bosmon> Well I can't see it in a pretty big way
2019-10-17T10:02:30  <Bosmon> e.g. I can't cd into it : P
2019-10-17T10:03:31  <Bosmon> jhernandez - can you refine a bit - are you saying just the changes to the tests are not backwards compatible, but also the changes to the proximity listener as well?
2019-10-17T10:03:50  <jhernandez> same thing
2019-10-17T10:04:32  <jhernandez> but we can make them backwards compatible if we really need it
2019-10-17T10:06:00  <stegru> I think the proximity fixes are backwards compatible
2019-10-17T10:06:01  <Bosmon> jhernandez - so if we apply the changes to the proximity listener, the app will not run properly on pre-1903?
2019-10-17T10:08:40  <jhernandez> well, the proximity listener is broken anyway
2019-10-17T10:10:03  <jhernandez> remember, this proximity user listener is for the vaio built-in nfc reader
2019-10-17T10:11:25  <stegru> c:\windows\sysnative only exists for 32-bit processes: http://i.imgur.com/0PGsrvd.png
2019-10-17T10:11:39  <jhernandez> and also, it's not being used at this moment, maybe we should either remove it (there are no plans to use it at this moment) or unplug it from our app tree to avoid it from being loaded
2019-10-17T10:12:58  <stegru> I don't think this will work on 32-bit systems
2019-10-17T10:19:56  <stegru> it's ok, it wont break unless it's running on a 32-bit OS, and the proximity listener is fixed
2019-10-17T10:24:25  <jhernandez> anyway, since updating the box in CI is easy, Alfredo just updated it  for me to run my PRs against the new version of windows
2019-10-17T10:25:27  <stegru> it looks like the upgrade "worked"
2019-10-17T10:29:09  <jhernandez> yes
2019-10-17T10:29:11  <jhernandez> haha
2019-10-17T10:29:13  <jhernandez> sorry
2019-10-17T10:32:30  <stegru> what is christopher's name in jira? (or github)

2019-10-17T11:32:30  <stegru> that's ok
2019-10-17T11:32:32  <jhernandez> did you figure out?
2019-10-17T11:32:42  <stegru> no, it's not urgent
2019-10-17T11:32:56  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-10-17T11:34:03  <jhernandez> btw, the pr against gpii-app that I'm passing through CI at this moment is going to fail

2019-10-17T11:38:19  <jhernandez> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: have you seen this error before? -> https://pastebin.com/9fSLawVB
2019-10-17T11:39:03  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I think there may be periodic corruption of the test container that hasn't come up often enough to troubleshoot.
2019-10-17T11:39:17  <the-t-in-rtf> You should be able to get past it by manually deleting the container.

2019-10-17T11:40:31  <Bosmon> corruption of the test container?!
2019-10-17T11:40:35  <jhernandez> sorry, looked at the vm's creation log and the couch setup didn't succeed
2019-10-17T11:40:37  <the-t-in-rtf> It hasn't come up in CI as far as I know, as that always starts fresh.
2019-10-17T11:40:44  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the kind of thing I mean
2019-10-17T11:40:46  <stegru> "hasn't come up often enough to troubleshoot" - I'll try that one with gregg
2019-10-17T11:40:50  <the-t-in-rtf> and makes perfect sense
2019-10-17T11:41:04  <the-t-in-rtf> well, if  you're writing test libraries that work fine in CI, go ahead.
2019-10-17T11:41:10  <jhernandez> I'll re-ok to test it
2019-10-17T11:41:16  <the-t-in-rtf> wait, what?
2019-10-17T11:41:21  <the-t-in-rtf> this happened in CI?
2019-10-17T11:41:25  <jhernandez> yup
2019-10-17T11:41:26  <the-t-in-rtf> if that's the case, shoot me a link.

2019-10-17T11:41:52  <jhernandez> we're talking about windows

2019-10-17T11:42:22  <the-t-in-rtf> So that's probably an error installing CouchDB then.
2019-10-17T11:43:03  <the-t-in-rtf> or setting it up.
2019-10-17T11:43:11  <the-t-in-rtf> If it happens consistently I can look into it.
2019-10-17T11:43:47  <jhernandez> that's what I said, "sorry, looked at the vm's creation log and the couch setup didn't succeed"
2019-10-17T11:43:57  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, where are those logs?
2019-10-17T11:44:04  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, timestamp?

2019-10-17T11:57:53  <the-t-in-rtf> The line and char number is not anything useful, sadly.
2019-10-17T12:04:04  <stegru> it looks like 2 scripts are running at the same time
2019-10-17T12:04:15  <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I wondered about the interleaving of messages
2019-10-17T12:04:27  <the-t-in-rtf> didn't know if that was normal.
2019-10-17T12:11:16  <stegru> perhaps there's a difference between the buffering of stderr and stdout - the scripts appear to be synchronous

2019-10-17T15:32:46  <stegru> yes, considering it's about to be deployed to thousands of LTSC machines
2019-10-17T15:32:50  <jhernandez> yes, that's true
2019-10-17T15:33:35  <jhernandez> so, are you suggesting to use Alfredo's vagrant gpii plugin to build and test against 2 versions of windows?
2019-10-17T15:33:54  <Bosmon> I'm certainly suggesting *something* to build and test against 2 versions of windows : P
2019-10-17T15:34:01  <jhernandez> haha
2019-10-17T15:34:13  <jhernandez> ok
2019-10-17T15:34:30  <Bosmon> It's something we've had on the cards for a while anyway
2019-10-17T15:34:40  <Bosmon> We dodged some bullets in having Windows 8 support canned, etc.
2019-10-17T15:35:25  <jhernandez> then I guess we need Alfredo to create another vagrant box with LTSC and figure out the best way to make the CI to build and run the tests in the 2 boxes
2019-10-17T15:35:33  <jhernandez> update our ci definitions, etc
2019-10-17T15:36:11  <Bosmon> I advise this!
2019-10-17T15:36:18  <Bosmon> Unless we want to be prepared for some nasty surprises
2019-10-17T15:36:45  <jhernandez> haha
2019-10-17T15:36:51  <jhernandez> fair enough
