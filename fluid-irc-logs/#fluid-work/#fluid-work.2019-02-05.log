2019-02-05T10:14:38  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, there is at least one kind of test instability in recent CI runs of my universal branch that I can do something about
2019-02-05T10:15:18  <the-t-in-rtf> there are occasionally failures to provision the new couch harness that fail with DB not found
2019-02-05T10:15:22  <the-t-in-rtf> To test that out, I'm in the process of updating gpii-couchdb-test-harness to be able to be tested in CI
2019-02-05T10:15:50  <the-t-in-rtf> but there is still some timing bug or other instability that I can't figure out
2019-02-05T10:16:01  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I'll fix what I can and we'll see what we see
2019-02-05T10:22:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I mention it because to better mirror CI I plan to set it up with a linux VM as the default.  I'll try to leave Windows as an option, but it seemed better to confirm that working up front.
2019-02-05T10:50:34  <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, that was so worth it, second test run, already verified the behaviour

2019-02-05T12:09:01  <the-t-in-rtf> I will commit what I have and at least we'll hopefully see the back of one bit of instability

2019-02-05T15:01:33  <simonjb> great, thanks gmoss

2019-02-05T15:08:23  <colinclark> thanks alanharnum
2019-02-05T15:08:24  <alanharnum> Samara from Sidewalk writing about the co-design process
2019-02-05T15:08:34  <colinclark> yup, we saw an early draft of it
2019-02-05T15:08:40  <colinclark> I thought it was pretty good overall
2019-02-05T15:15:55  <colinclark> what did you think, alanharnum?
2019-02-05T15:16:27  <alanharnum> colinclark: i agree it's pretty good - it's nice to see the great work people did starting to inform the broader discussion

2019-02-05T16:53:42  <jhernandez> I've been taking a look and testing https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/54
2019-02-05T16:53:48  <stegru> yes
2019-02-05T16:53:53  <jhernandez> it's great
2019-02-05T16:54:30  <stegru> oh yes, that
2019-02-05T16:54:35  <jhernandez> haha
2019-02-05T16:54:50  <jhernandez> yes, still we need to figure out the console thing
2019-02-05T16:55:03  <stegru> yeh, I've been using it to speed up the build+test cycle
2019-02-05T16:55:14  <stegru> I know how to
2019-02-05T16:55:20  <stegru> well, i knew how to
2019-02-05T16:55:50  <jhernandez> but yeah, compressing/uncompressing sounds good to me, but not sure how it'll behave when reinstalling, uninstalling, etc
2019-02-05T16:56:25  <stegru> yep, there needs to be a rm -rf
2019-02-05T16:56:41  <jhernandez> we need to be very careful with that and avoid any mess when installed
2019-02-05T16:56:46  <jhernandez> yes, an rm -fr
2019-02-05T16:57:51  <jhernandez> however, I would also take a look if we can put our node_modules folder on a diet
2019-02-05T16:58:10  <stegru> yes, definitely!

2019-02-05T16:59:17  <jhernandez> and
2019-02-05T16:59:22  <jhernandez> now that I'm checking
2019-02-05T16:59:25  <stegru> for a start, there's a load of obj files
2019-02-05T16:59:54  <jhernandez> infusion is around 60Mb
2019-02-05T17:00:00  <jhernandez> yeah, that too
2019-02-05T17:00:12  <jhernandez> backing to infusion, I get like 6 copies of infusion
2019-02-05T17:00:51  <jhernandez> heh
2019-02-05T17:00:53  <jhernandez> 10, exactly
2019-02-05T17:01:00  <stegru> 11 for me
2019-02-05T17:01:31  <stegru> no, you're right
2019-02-05T17:01:36  <jhernandez> so, 10 x 60Mb
2019-02-05T17:01:47  <jhernandez> you already have 600Mbs

2019-02-05T17:04:02  <stegru> they're different sizes, so different versions are being used
2019-02-05T17:04:09  <jhernandez> yup
2019-02-05T17:04:26  <stegru> perhaps making all the infusion users use the same version would prevent this?
2019-02-05T17:05:38  <stegru> ah, it's "only" 448MB
2019-02-05T17:05:56  <stegru> du -sh $(find | grep 'infusion$')
2019-02-05T17:06:20  <stegru> but yes, that's almost 400mb waste
2019-02-05T17:15:28  <Bosmon> stegru - yes, in the meantime, you can just delete all ones other than the one at top level
2019-02-05T17:16:05  <Bosmon> cindyli1 - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/732 is ready for another look

2019-02-05T17:17:19  <stegru> yes - I was thinking the dependents of lower version ones may break.. but of course, only 1 infusion is loaded
