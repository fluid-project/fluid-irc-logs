2019-01-17T11:48:58  <javjarfer[m]> how would you recommend me to make a schema for a setting which is an array of two values?
2019-01-17T11:49:14  <javjarfer[m]> I was just wondering because of yesterday conversation with resolution

2019-01-17T12:38:23  <the-t-in-rtf> if you mean the value is literally something like [val1, val2], then it's type: "array"
2019-01-17T12:38:33  <the-t-in-rtf> and then "items" to describe what is allowed within the array
2019-01-17T12:38:35  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m]
2019-01-17T12:38:59  <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully they don't do anything sad like encode meaning into the position
2019-01-17T12:41:45  <javjarfer[m]> I see, thanks you the-t-in-rtf
2019-01-17T12:47:30  <the-t-in-rtf> If you need anything else, send an example or two and we can sketch something out on a validator
2019-01-17T12:47:35  <the-t-in-rtf> say the one I wrote... ;)
2019-01-17T12:47:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean the demo
2019-01-17T12:47:58  <the-t-in-rtf> probably I should add state bookmarking to that at some point... hmmm.

2019-01-17T18:17:47  <Bosmon> Hey there colinclark :)
2019-01-17T18:18:18  <colinclark> This is the Electron file dialog API: https://electronjs.org/docs/api/dialog#dialogshowopendialogbrowserwindow-options-callback
2019-01-17T18:18:45  <colinclark> In my current version of Bubbles, my openFileDialog component has a model field consisting of the URLs selected by the user
2019-01-17T18:18:56  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.122.106.129> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2019-01-17T18:18:58  <colinclark> and this is just directly relayed to the one video that the app currently supports
2019-01-17T18:19:33  <colinclark> But I'm just in the process of supporting multiple videosâ€”they'll be dynamic components createdOnEvent
2019-01-17T18:19:37  <javjarfer[m]> Hey there Bosmon ! Sorry, but I think we didn't understand each other very well
2019-01-17T18:19:50  *** alanharnum <alanharnum!alanharnum@nat/ocadu/x-gdawuojazjvhzbwq> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2019-01-17T18:19:55  <javjarfer[m]> If you have a couple of min I can explain you the issue better
2019-01-17T18:19:59  *** alanharnum <alanharnum!alanharnum@nat/ocadu/x-dzofmafcyvocibob> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-17T18:20:02  <colinclark> so when a user finishes selecting a video for a layer, it will automatically create a new, empty layer
2019-01-17T18:20:21  <colinclark> so of course now my 1:1 relaying of the openFileDialog's model to a video is no longer appropriate
2019-01-17T18:21:07  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - Sure, I can listen, but I may not have too much time to think this evening if it gets into too much detail
2019-01-17T18:21:29  <colinclark> at this point do you think I should just treat the openFileDialog as no longer a model component, and just a thing that exposes the open() API and fires an event when things have been selected?
2019-01-17T18:21:46  <colinclark> or is there some kind of highe-order modelling that I should be considering?
2019-01-17T18:21:53  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay, we can continue tomorrow (or whenever you can) then if you think it's getting into too much detail
2019-01-17T18:22:27  <Bosmon> colinclark - it could be a model component but might need to be lensed in a more interesting way
2019-01-17T18:22:28  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.122.106.129> has joined #fluid-work
2019-01-17T18:22:34  <colinclark> hmmm
2019-01-17T18:22:36  <colinclark> how so?
2019-01-17T18:23:01  <Bosmon> I think in general we find that hashes are far more amenable to any kind of public model idiom than arrays
2019-01-17T18:23:42  <Bosmon> So you could have dialog lens its file into a "hash of filename to true" structure which just holds the files for all currently selected files/layers
2019-01-17T18:24:00  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - is the state of the problem reflected by your currently checked-in branch?
2019-01-17T18:24:21  <colinclark> hmmm, I think I see what you mean
2019-01-17T18:24:51  <Bosmon> colinclark - and the other good virtue of this structure is that simultaneous contributions from multiple sources can be safely superimposed
2019-01-17T18:25:09  <Bosmon> It is also a good starting point for our "is everything ready yet?" structure that we were chatting about privately
2019-01-17T18:25:15  <colinclark> yes
2019-01-17T18:25:59  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon:  Yes, current master is affected by that issue
2019-01-17T18:26:04  <colinclark> and so whenever someone adds a different file to a layer, I can have the old file URL removed from the larger model
2019-01-17T18:26:14  <colinclark> I suppose this is still more properly the model of, perhaps, my "layer stack" component
2019-01-17T18:26:35  <colinclark> the openFileDialog, as Electron at least has structured it, has no state
2019-01-17T18:26:53  <colinclark> it's something in my application that has the concept of "all the videos that are currently open"
2019-01-17T18:28:01  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - perhaps it would helpful if you could write up all the details of the problem in a JIRA, it would make it easier to keep track of it if they were all in one place
2019-01-17T18:28:06  <Bosmon> And then easier for other people to comment too
2019-01-17T18:28:28  <colinclark> is there any real meaning to the value (true) in the hash of URLs?
2019-01-17T18:29:27  <Bosmon> colinclark - no meaning
2019-01-17T18:29:47  <Bosmon> But I guess it is the beginning of the suggestion that other values might appear there : P
2019-01-17T18:29:51  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: sure, I just wanted to confirm is was the system behavior wrong or it's a situation that could happen under current contract before submitting the issue
2019-01-17T18:30:12  <javjarfer[m]> I can create a ambiguous one with the details, and maybe we can follow there
2019-01-17T18:30:13  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - we may only discover this after analysing your report :)
2019-01-17T18:30:22  <javjarfer[m]> okay, doing it
2019-01-17T18:31:02  <Bosmon> colinclark - I guess this shows the rather profound nature of our problem that arises from seeking to replace CS "data structures" in general
2019-01-17T18:31:06  <Bosmon> This one is going to run and run : P
2019-01-17T18:31:37  <Bosmon> But for example, in thinking about Boxer with sgithens we note that something is going to have to be done to replace its widespread reliance on arrays and array-like structures
2019-01-17T18:32:00  <Bosmon> The standard response of a Computer Scientist faced with these problems is to "create a new data structure" or "abstract data type"
2019-01-17T18:32:06  <Bosmon> But we don't quite have that option quite in that form
2019-01-17T18:32:43  <Bosmon> In the long future, it may end up boiling down to that
2019-01-17T18:33:12  <Bosmon> Obviously we aren't going to tell future citizen coders to work with data structures which consist of a "hash of keys to true"
2019-01-17T18:33:38  <Bosmon> But this seems to be the closest kind of embodiment of the kind of structure we're interested in in the domain which we currently speak of of being "materialised"
2019-01-17T18:34:12  <Bosmon> In that we have to "work with what we've got" in terms of what affordances JSON gives us, and this is something we can't abandon lightly, or perhaps in some senses at all
2019-01-17T18:35:02  <Bosmon> But I feel in the next decade or two, all of this work will result in some kind of more nuanced concept of what it means to be "materialized" and what our data structure actually is that we are positioning as the "community replacement for arrays"

2019-01-17T18:41:08  <colinclark> it's not enough just to have a list or a hash of URLs from the openFileDialog, in that each video layer needs actually know what URL it is bound to in particular
2019-01-17T18:41:22  <colinclark> a dialog, itself really has no state

2019-01-17T19:43:28  <Bosmon> colinclark - so the invocation of the openFileDialog will be tied to a particular layer?

2019-01-17T19:44:06  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - a pull would help, especially given it seems odd to have two branches called GPII-3651 : P
2019-01-17T19:47:39  <colinclark> Bosmon: That's correct. In the layerView, there's a little placeholder box where the video will be displayed with an "Add Video" button overlaid on top of it
2019-01-17T19:51:12  <colinclark> Bosmon: Here's a little demo video from a couple days ago, where you can see the interaction: https://imgur.com/a/7u6iUvm
2019-01-17T19:51:41  <colinclark> In the ideal case, when a user successfully adds a video to the last layer, a new will be added beneath it
2019-01-17T19:52:31  <colinclark> eventually, the empty space to the right of each video box will be more video boxesâ€”sequences of videos
2019-01-17T19:54:06  <colinclark> even further along will be the ability to drag and drop videos amongst the layersâ€”so, say you decide that you actually want the video on layer #3 to be top-most, you'd drag it up from it's box on layer #3 to the one on layer #1
2019-01-17T19:54:12  <colinclark> or reorder the sequence accordingly
2019-01-17T19:55:22  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: no problem! I'm submitting the two pulls, the two GPII-3651 branches are one for each repo, Windows and universal
2019-01-17T20:11:22  <sgithens> Bosmon: hi
2019-01-17T20:11:26  <sgithens> they are on
2019-01-17T20:11:35  <sgithens> at least the upper half
2019-01-17T20:16:07  <sgithens> colinclark, the large + button looks great!
2019-01-17T20:16:16  <colinclark> ha, thanks :)
2019-01-17T20:16:37  <colinclark> the styling's a little better since i did that screen capture
2019-01-17T20:16:54  <sgithens> oh, I cloned the repo.  I didn't know there was a screen capture
2019-01-17T20:17:01  <colinclark> ah cool
2019-01-17T20:17:01  <sgithens> yesterday it was black
2019-01-17T20:17:04  <colinclark> so you can see the latest
2019-01-17T20:17:06  <sgithens> today there is a pane!
2019-01-17T20:17:10  <sgithens> well, this morning
2019-01-17T20:17:17  <colinclark> yup, I merged two branches last night
