2020-03-26T08:18:41  <HarshSingh[m]> gmoss: thank you so much for your comments. Most of them are just about formatting. So can I believe my proposal has no other flaws ?
2020-03-26T08:22:35  <gmoss> HarshSingh[m]: there are no glaring flaws, but the formatting could be made more consistent throughout. If you are able to address all of my comments, it will be helpful.

2020-03-26T08:24:13  <HarshSingh[m]> gmoss: After working on your comments shall I directly submit the proposal ?or you shall review it Again ?
2020-03-26T08:27:34  <gmoss> HarshSingh[m]: I'm not sure if submitting multiple versions of the final report is an option. I can't guarantee I'll have time to look at it again before Monday, so if you can submit multiple times, I would suggest doing that just in case
2020-03-26T08:29:26  <HarshSingh[m]> gmoss: sure then I will wait for your review again till monday then submit it the last day even if you dont review that again.
2020-03-26T08:29:26  <HarshSingh[m]> Happy to hear from you.

2020-03-26T09:11:21  <gmoss> batey96_: you can use two of your three proposal slots to submit a proposal for each project, if you wish to do so. You can only be accepted for one of the projects, though

2020-03-26T09:24:39  <batey96_> HarshSingh[m]: currently on the migration of F/F projects
2020-03-26T09:38:09  <SemicolonExp> just a general question gmoss, I was wondering if we needed to inform the mentors when we submit a draft or you would see it
2020-03-26T09:39:26  <gmoss> SemicolonExp: we can see a list of all the proposals, though we don't receive notifications as such.
2020-03-26T09:40:42  <gmoss> SemicolonExp: I would say a respectful request for review is reasonable, being considerate of the mentors' time, of course :)
2020-03-26T09:41:33  <SemicolonExp> awesome, thanks gmoss!

2020-03-26T13:51:23  <aman_> @Justin_o in the project "Refactor and automate infusion Documentation"
2020-03-26T13:52:27  <Justin_o> aman_: so the documentation contents are in one repo, and the SSG related code, config, and etc is in another.. so somehow they will need to come together so that when the site is deployed the contents will be displayed on the site
2020-03-26T13:55:38  <shashank137> Okay @Justin_o I was asking about the tool(Hugo or Jekyll) is it decided or it will be decided later?
2020-03-26T13:56:03  <aman_> @Justin_o I think we can copy the contents of that file and then refactor it in the SSG related repo.what you think?
2020-03-26T13:56:39  <sachin10101998> shashank137 choice of ssg is open for discussion. We have to propose the choice in our proposals

2020-03-26T14:18:15  <aman_> @Justin_o
2020-03-26T14:18:54  <aman_> We can use a middleware where we can link two repositories what are your vies for this?

2020-03-26T14:25:18  <sunn-e> Hey, Hi, Sunny here again. I see it's been 3 days and the proposal I have submitted has not been accepted yet. I would kindly request mentors to please look at the proposals as the proposal submission deadline is in 5 days. It would help to make necessary changes, if any. Thank you. :)
2020-03-26T14:25:52  <sunn-e> (by accepted i meant reviewed by anyone yet)
2020-03-26T14:27:36  <Justin_o> aman_: I'm sure there are quite a few different approaches and options. Describing what you've researched and why you feel that a solution is viable  could be included in the proposal.
2020-03-26T14:28:09  <Justin_o> sunn-e: which project did you submit a proposal for?

2020-03-26T14:29:13  <sunn-e> For Navigation using GamePad, t t in rtf is mentor.
2020-03-26T14:29:49  <aman_> I've found the best solution for shared middleware to be writing custom middleware and deploying, then  This way all our services can simply import and use our middleware and when you make changes it's reflected across all services.

2020-03-26T14:49:34  <sachin10101998> Justin_o ohh It's ok. gmoss reviewed the proposal earlier today. I thought we'd be getting reviews for multiple people from community.

2020-03-26T14:49:57  <aman_> @Justin_o Sir should i try with different approaches ?

2020-03-26T14:51:22  <Justin_o> aman_: it's probably prudent to explore many approaches, however what you suggest in your proposal is up to you.
2020-03-26T14:52:00  <aman_> Using middleware would be right what do you think for it?
2020-03-26T14:52:02  <Justin_o> sunn-e: it's show up now thanks. You'll need to wait for the-t-in-rtf to review it

2020-03-26T14:53:21  <Justin_o> aman_: it's one potential approach. I don't know if it's the right one though, that would require more research and etc. Ultimately the final approach used will be discussed with the mentor and community. But we would need to explore options first.

2020-03-26T21:44:49  <batey96_> hello gmoss can we please talk a little on the refactoring and automation of infusion docs?
2020-03-26T21:45:44  <gmoss> Hi batey96_, what would you like to discuss?
2020-03-26T21:47:20  <batey96_> Justin_o: gmoss jhung, do we place more or less concern for the developers on content management?? after decoupling the content and static site generator?(
2020-03-26T21:48:25  <batey96_> considering the fact that we can well handle nondevelopers on the content management
2020-03-26T21:49:47  <gmoss> batey96_: that's an interesting question. I think, realistically, it will primarily be developers who will be updating the documentation site along with changes in the framework. That said, if you can make changes to make content management less painful, that will help everyone, developer or not
2020-03-26T21:50:24  <gmoss> I suppose it will depend on how that work can fit into your project scope
2020-03-26T21:51:12  <batey96_> okay.i get your point
2020-03-26T21:52:03  <batey96_> thanks for your reply..will be back if i need any help again
