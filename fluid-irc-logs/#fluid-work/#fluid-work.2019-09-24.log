2019-09-24T12:27:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: for this comment https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/37#issuecomment-533557189 on UIO+ update to work with FLUID-6148
2019-09-24T12:27:50  <Bosmon2> Justin_o - yes
2019-09-24T12:28:03  <Justin_o> Did you want that change so that we can merge it in right now?
2019-09-24T12:28:04  <Bosmon2> I was thinking about that and realised that since UIO+ is self-contained, we have no reason not to update it to FLUID-6148
2019-09-24T12:28:11  *** Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2019-09-24T12:28:31  <Bosmon> So I don't think we have a particular need to keep it working with the old framework, as long as the use of the new one does not generate fresh bugs
2019-09-24T12:29:12  <Bosmon> Btw I got LENSED COMPONENTS working last night :)
2019-09-24T12:29:13  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/824/commits/1e80353acb9bba350e48b9e9d5ef56315f6c97c7
2019-09-24T12:29:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, maybe I should hold off till after https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/35 is merged, then test with that to make sure none of those parts are broken and do a bunch of testing.
2019-09-24T12:29:53  <Bosmon> Justin_o - sounds good
2019-09-24T12:29:58  <Justin_o> That's great to hear about the Lensed components
2019-09-24T12:30:19  <Bosmon> I thought I still wanted to wait for the-t-in-rtf to get the gpii-webdriver and gpii-testem release chain sorted out, but we could merge pull 35 as is if you wanted to go ahead
2019-09-24T12:32:01  <Bosmon> This function is the core implementation of the framework's new workflow idiom: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/1e80353acb9bba350e48b9e9d5ef56315f6c97c7/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L1962
2019-09-24T12:32:35  <Justin_o> how long do you think before the-t-in-rtf is ready with the gpis-testem and gpii-webdriver?
2019-09-24T12:32:46  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine probably a day or so?
2019-09-24T12:33:10  <Bosmon> In theory the updates are minor, there is just an issue with test failures not being properly surfaced
2019-09-24T12:34:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I can wait a day or so
2019-09-24T12:35:07  <Justin_o> Bosmon: reading through your lensed commit right now.. question for the code comments, are we using "<code>something</code> or " `something` ". I think we've done both styles in Infusion and it might be nice to standardize on one or the other
2019-09-24T12:36:51  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think in code comments we should standardize on `something` - given we are going to have to write our own markdown generator for this, we should just pick the simplest format
2019-09-24T12:38:28  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that sounds reasonable, in your last commit you had some of the style <code></code> but I think that's because it was like that already. At any rate, we should probably do a pass through the whole code base to bring the JSDoc syntax and these types of inconsistencies up-to-date and inline.
2019-09-24T12:38:54  <Bosmon> Justin_o - for sure - I need to backfill the docs in this branch anyway since I introduced a lot of new functions this week ...
2019-09-24T12:40:13  <Justin_o> speaking of which, I was talking to greatislander, simon and jhung yesterday and filed these two JIRAs  https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6401 and https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6402
2019-09-24T12:40:32  <Justin_o> the latter still needs more investigation for use in Infusion, but the former is something we should probably do in the near term
2019-09-24T12:40:52  <Justin_o> both of these should help with consistency in our code base though and be useful for others coming into the project as well.
2019-09-24T12:41:49  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but we should also touch up our CONTRIBUTING file and perhaps our coding and commit standards with our preferred comment styles as well.
2019-09-24T12:44:07  <Bosmon> Justin_o - wow, BEM is interesting
2019-09-24T12:44:16  <Bosmon> But I guess a big departure from our historical FSS recommendations
2019-09-24T12:45:24  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we were talking about that in the channel last Thursday. and it didn't seem conceptually too far off from our current CSS naming convention https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards#CodingandCommitStandards-CSSNamingConventions
2019-09-24T12:46:43  <Justin_o> although I don't think our naming scheme encoded the structure requirements like BEM does, so there will most likely be more than just name changes necessary
2019-09-24T12:47:25  <Justin_o> I feel like it would help us to be more thoughtful about writing CSS though and could help to simplify our usage in addition to making it easier for others to restyle our components
2019-09-24T12:47:52  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - although it would be nice to retain our general namespacing prefixes - does BEM allow for that?
2019-09-24T12:48:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that might have been my first question.. my interpretation after reading the naming scheme is that using a namespace can be considered part of the block name
2019-09-24T12:48:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: also the linter that greatislander found for BEM also supports namespacing
2019-09-24T12:49:29  <Justin_o> greatislander: can you remind me what that linter was, and also the example you showed us about the code convention docs
2019-09-24T12:50:25  <Justin_o> Bosmon: if we switch to BEM style we also need to consider if we are just using it for Styling related class names, or both JS selectors as well.
2019-09-24T12:51:14  <Justin_o> I think it should work for both, but I haven't looked into how it might affect the JS selectors.

2019-09-24T13:52:30  <cindyli> hi, javjarfer[m], regarding this issue - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4136, do you have a gpii-app branch for me to reproduce the problem? is this branch using the universal master? the reason i'm asking is because gpii-app master branch is using stegru's GPII-3927 branch which points to an older universal version
2019-09-24T13:59:27  <cindyli> seems gpii/windows master is using the universal commit I need. i will create my own gpii-app branch to use windows master.
2019-09-24T14:00:17  <greatislander> Justin_o and Bosmon, the linter I found for enforcing BEM was https://github.com/simonsmith/stylelint-selector-bem-pattern which is itself a wrapper for https://github.com/postcss/postcss-bem-linter
2019-09-24T14:02:21  <Justin_o> greatislander: thanks, I've updated the JIRA with that
2019-09-24T14:02:29  <greatislander> Great!

2019-09-24T14:28:36  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: Morphic started based off the gpii-app master (with a little adjustment pointing gpii-windows to gpii/windows master branch) doesn't seem to have menu items for mouse settings "DoubleClick" and "SwapMouseButtons", so I still need your gpii-app branch to debug https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4136. thanks
2019-09-24T14:33:45  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: hi sorry about the delay yes, that branch presents the issue

2019-09-24T14:38:43  <cindyli> thanks, javjarfer[m]. i noticed your branch is also using stegru's GPII-3927 branch - https://github.com/JavierJF/gpii-app/blob/GPII-4136/package.json#L15 and this branch uses an older universal commit -https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/GPII-3927/package.json#L20, which doesn't include my fix for settings filtering yet. but anyway, I will do some debugging to see if it's universal related
2019-09-24T14:41:08  <cindyli> just fyi, the fix for settings filtering is merged on sep 17 - https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/cb3500e10b0b1e2b7bd3bbf34d42326145e4c89c
