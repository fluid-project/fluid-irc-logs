2020-02-28T10:53:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I've found even more invalid/outdated cruft in our test data that I'm pruning to eliminate that as a source of errors

2020-02-28T11:27:46  <jhernandez> Bosmon: buenos días
2020-02-28T11:28:08  <jhernandez> so
2020-02-28T11:28:48  <jhernandez> looks like I found the culprit for the users not signing-out problem -> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4370?focusedCommentId=42816&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-42816
2020-02-28T11:30:37  <jhernandez> now we have a workaround for the deployed pilot sites, and I guess that here we'd need the help from javjarfer[m] and stegru to exactly figure out why it's happening
2020-02-28T11:38:00  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: good morning!
2020-02-28T11:38:14  <javjarfer[m]> do we have any info in the logs about the calling to the binary?
2020-02-28T11:38:27  <javjarfer[m]> any visible errors or relevant messages?
2020-02-28T11:40:21  <javjarfer[m]> also, do we know the Windows versions that those machines are using?
2020-02-28T11:42:16  <jhernandez> as far as I can tell, the windows version is not relevant
2020-02-28T11:42:24  <jhernandez> I've seen it happening in different versions
2020-02-28T11:43:31  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: do we know if there is an error reported by the settings handler itself? Right now the colorvision solution is faulty due to validation errors
2020-02-28T11:45:05  <jhernandez> IIRC, I couldn't see anything relevant in the logs
2020-02-28T11:45:15  <jhernandez> and it does nothing to do with validation
2020-02-28T11:45:29  <jhernandez> s/does/has
2020-02-28T11:45:53  <jhernandez> the validation errors only happen when trying to save, as far as I can tell
2020-02-28T11:46:19  <jhernandez> as I pointed out in the comment
2020-02-28T11:46:32  <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/d8277e304ef6ee98bfaa466acf72b42338f74661/gpii/node_modules/systemSettingsHandler/src/systemSettingsHandler.js#L49
2020-02-28T11:46:47  <jhernandez> this child_process.execFile could be culprit
2020-02-28T11:47:59  <jhernandez> maybe we should make it sync
2020-02-28T11:48:21  <jhernandez> but I'm not the best person to tell
2020-02-28T11:52:27  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: that's really weird, because in case of something failing there, in the case of the exe not being properly called, or returning an error code, the error should be logged
2020-02-28T11:52:51  <javjarfer[m]> could this means that morphic is not waiting for the settingsHandler promise to close itself?
2020-02-28T11:53:57  <javjarfer[m]> or the promise is never resolved...
2020-02-28T11:54:49  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: could you give the version of the branches that are included in that build in particular?
2020-02-28T11:57:05  <jhernandez> most efficient way to seeing it happening
2020-02-28T11:57:11  <jhernandez> get the 1.3.1 installer
2020-02-28T11:57:16  <jhernandez> or the 1.3.2
2020-02-28T11:57:20  <jhernandez> install it
2020-02-28T11:57:37  <jhernandez> and try reproducing it
2020-02-28T11:57:57  <jhernandez> it's true that is not 100%
2020-02-28T11:58:09  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: okay, going for it
2020-02-28T11:59:45  <stegru> perhaps it should be listening for the `exit` event, so the exit code can be looked at
2020-02-28T11:59:46  <jhernandez> I had a hard time reproducing it on my vm until it appeared
2020-02-28T12:00:46  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: what is interesting is that jhernandez have found this output in the logs  https://pastebin.com/1MjhXSpj, which means that this section of the code is reached https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/d8277e304ef6ee98bfaa466acf72b42338f74661/gpii/node_modules/systemSettingsHandler/src/systemSettingsHandler.js#L63
2020-02-28T12:01:20  <jhernandez> that's the only thing I could see in my logs
2020-02-28T12:01:33  <jhernandez> maybe I missed another error
2020-02-28T12:01:36  <stegru> yes, similar to whaat i find
2020-02-28T12:01:49  <stegru> but i also got this:
2020-02-28T12:01:50  <stegru> 16:57:17.116:  {
2020-02-28T12:01:50  <stegru>     "killed": false,
2020-02-28T12:01:50  <stegru>     "code": 3221225794,
2020-02-28T12:01:50  <stegru>     "signal": null,
2020-02-28T12:01:50  <stegru>     "cmd": "SettingsHelper.exe"
2020-02-28T12:01:52  <stegru> }
2020-02-28T12:02:04  <jhernandez> but this one also appears also at startup sometimes
2020-02-28T12:02:36  <stegru> the exit code boils down to STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED
2020-02-28T12:03:15  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: jhernandez  have never seen that error in my life
2020-02-28T12:03:30  <stegru> and I think that's because the session is closing
2020-02-28T12:04:04  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: omg you are right, session closing and we are trying to load system dlls
2020-02-28T12:04:13  <javjarfer[m]> maybe that's the issue
2020-02-28T12:04:18  <jhernandez> yup, and that's the theory from the beginning
2020-02-28T12:05:44  <javjarfer[m]> that's interesting, stegru do you think that once the shutdown signal is received from system, we can no longer allocate certain system resources?
2020-02-28T12:06:47  <javjarfer[m]> but if it doesn't happens "always" that means that it's timing related
2020-02-28T12:06:49  <jhernandez> hmm
2020-02-28T12:07:03  <jhernandez> what else make use of the settingsHelper?
2020-02-28T12:08:10  <stegru> grep -i SystemSettings testData/solutions/win32.json5
2020-02-28T12:08:44  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: some magnifier settings, some narrator settings, bluelight setting, and touchpad timeout setting
2020-02-28T12:10:22  <javjarfer[m]> for what we know, I also support that it's a timing issue during system shutdown, looks like postgresql people also found themselves with this issue https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/B348D3898124094EB15E90DD33E3EB1227DEA25576@ex01.ei.edstrom.com
2020-02-28T12:11:49  <stegru> yes, that appears to be exactly the same problem
2020-02-28T12:12:15  <stegru> It does not happen on every log off, but if the Windows console user
2020-02-28T12:12:15  <stegru> > > logs off of the server at just the wrong time while a backend is
2020-02-28T12:12:15  <stegru> > > starting up, the backend terminates with exception 0xC0000142
2020-02-28T12:13:59  <stegru> I think a process tries to load a system library, and the library says "go away, we're shutting down"
2020-02-28T12:14:42  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: the only way to overcome that, is have the system library already for that point
2020-02-28T12:15:05  <javjarfer[m]> but that would mean turning the settingsHelper into a service
2020-02-28T12:15:14  <stegru> yes, I was thinking of something like that
2020-02-28T12:15:20  *** chahar <chahar!~neetigya@14.99.66.251> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-28T12:15:23  <stegru> but that only fixes the settings helper
2020-02-28T12:15:49  <stegru> maybe not a service, but it keeps running while the person is keyed in
2020-02-28T12:15:51  <javjarfer[m]> stegru:  yeah, not the other system calls which could end the same way you mean
2020-02-28T12:17:02  <stegru> the system sends 2 shutdown messages.. WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_ENDSESSIon... i think after the last message is when things can be started
2020-02-28T12:17:23  <stegru> that's why made it perform the keyout after the first.. but for some reason, it's stopped working
2020-02-28T12:17:45  <javjarfer[m]> stegru, maybe it's taking too long?
2020-02-28T12:18:09  <javjarfer[m]> there are timing assumptions about how fast you need to respond to WM_QUERYENDSESSION?
2020-02-28T12:19:02  <stegru> well, the response can only be immediate - because the keyout is async
2020-02-28T12:19:42  <stegru> as soon as the message handler function returns, it's responded.
2020-02-28T12:19:53  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: then that's the issue, I think we should delay the response to the message until we know that we are keyed out
2020-02-28T12:20:06  <stegru> right.. but we can't
2020-02-28T12:20:40  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: there is no way to tell from the service when the application have ended a keyout?
2020-02-28T12:21:05  <stegru> woah, my source code has been deleted

2020-02-28T12:24:32  <stegru> that's how it responds to the message... once the function returns, the message has been responded to
2020-02-28T12:24:56  <stegru> and while execution is still in the function, the keyout can't be performed
2020-02-28T12:26:55  <stegru> if windows messages could accept a promise for a response, then that would be great :)
2020-02-28T12:29:04  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: haha yes... so of course it would
2020-02-28T12:29:35  <javjarfer[m]> stegru, do you think that what we could do, is simply return false, until we know that the user have logged out, and then return true?
2020-02-28T12:30:26  <stegru> that could cancel the logout
2020-02-28T12:30:33  <javjarfer[m]> I mean, the whole point of that message is to query if the application is ready for the shutdown
2020-02-28T12:30:50  <javjarfer[m]> and we are saying that we are ready but we are not
2020-02-28T12:32:12  <stegru> i know
2020-02-28T12:33:12  <stegru> but I think the system races ahead to the "no new processes" state anyway
2020-02-28T12:33:31  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: what we could do, is to ignore the first WM_QUERYENDSESSION, but launch the sign-off process, and then respond to the second message WM_END­SESSION
2020-02-28T12:34:07  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: if you ignore the WM_QUERYENDSESSION, is like leaving a prompt for the user, the system waits, but eventually shutdowns anyway
2020-02-28T12:36:15  <javjarfer[m]> then, when we get the WM_ENDSESSION message, we check if the logout operation is complete, if it's, we tell the system "it's okay", if it's not, then I think it's simply not okay to logout because the operation isn't complete
2020-02-28T12:36:40  <stegru> well.. i've just made it start notepad in response to WM_QUERYEND, and it couldn't be started
2020-02-28T12:38:12  <javjarfer[m]> stegru that explains things for sure xddd
2020-02-28T12:38:43  <jhernandez> so
2020-02-28T12:38:43  <stegru>     if (msg === WM_QUERYENDSESSION) {
2020-02-28T12:38:44  <stegru>         fluid.log(fluid.logLevel.FATAL, "System shutdown detected.");
2020-02-28T12:38:44  <stegru>         try {
2020-02-28T12:38:44  <stegru>             var cp = require("child_process").exec("notepad.exe", function (err) {
2020-02-28T12:38:57  <stegru> no worky
2020-02-28T12:39:27  <jhernandez> we can't just reset that setting to std when shutting down, right?
2020-02-28T12:39:34  <javjarfer[m]> that means... that you can't even allocate certain things after the WM_QUERYEND
2020-02-28T12:39:46  <stegru> right, jhernandez
2020-02-28T12:40:10  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: yes, right, basically, we shouldn't
2020-02-28T12:40:44  <javjarfer[m]> stegru, jhernandez or we should rework it for having everything loaded in memory at the point an user is shutting down
2020-02-28T12:41:37  <javjarfer[m]> basically that would mean keeping the handler live while the user is logged in, and closing it after the login out
2020-02-28T12:42:57  <javjarfer[m]> stegru: weird thing is that... we can access many other system things during that logout operation... but we can't that certain one, it bothers me not knowing which of them can or we can't access
2020-02-28T12:43:07  <javjarfer[m]> we access all the settings "on demand"
2020-02-28T12:43:31  <javjarfer[m]> which means that for being certain that all the other settings work, we need to do the very same operation for all the other ones
2020-02-28T12:45:39  <stegru> maybe
2020-02-28T12:46:17  <stegru> ok, i've hacked the handler to resolve on error - and the logout succeeds

2020-02-28T12:47:42  <stegru> the rejection from windows.executeHelper doesn't get caught, so the handler promise is still waited upon
2020-02-28T12:48:12  <stegru> the settings still don't get restored.. but the logout does continue
2020-02-28T12:55:22  <javjarfer[m]> stegru , I don't know how much of a solution is that... I think Gregg will like it to behave just like the other settings
2020-02-28T12:56:10  <stegru> well, it's a good solution in the sense that, a failure of a settings handler doesn't prevent the user from logging out
2020-02-28T12:56:45  <stegru> there are 2 bugs: 1: user can't log out, 2: settings don't get restored
2020-02-28T12:57:31  <javjarfer[m]> stegru , Should I start working into having it loaded during the whole time a user it's logged in ?
2020-02-28T12:59:00  <sachin10101998> Justin_o in floeproject repo at floeproject.org/lib/infusion/src/components/textFieldControl/css/TextfieldSlider.css file, you have used animate property at various places. Instead of animate, it should be animation I guess. Should we fix it?

2020-02-28T13:14:52  <javjarfer[m]> stegru , true, sorry, don't know what I was thinking. Well... The only solution is "don't require any process start in any settings"
2020-02-28T13:15:13  <stegru> i know
2020-02-28T13:15:54  <javjarfer[m]> stegru , another thing would be to log the current state, and do a reset to standard in the next login

2020-02-28T13:39:29  <javjarfer[m]> so, maybe we should try to create a list of settings which are absolutely necessary to recover prior to logout (highcontrast) and we will need to have everything loaded for being able to recover that settings
2020-02-28T13:39:47  <javjarfer[m]> and log the state of everything else, and recover it in the next login

2020-02-28T13:42:37  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - we discussed this issue also with jhernandez who thought he would pass some choices on to Gregg
2020-02-28T13:42:42  <javjarfer[m]> also, what process do we spawn during highcontrast change that makes it a candidate for having this issues?
2020-02-28T13:42:58  <Bosmon> Alternatively we could create a list of settings which spawn processes, and just mark the LM to not try to apply these on shutdown
2020-02-28T13:43:33  <Bosmon> It would be better to make our absolute best effort to restore the system to a known condition, rather than wrangle about which settings were "absolutely necessary" : P
2020-02-28T13:44:24  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, I agree, I just meant "absolutely necessary before logoff" I was counting to recover the rest in the next login operation
2020-02-28T13:44:43  <javjarfer[m]> I don't think leaving the system in a unknown state for the user is an option
2020-02-28T13:45:31  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - but the risk here is with making the login operation difficult or impossible for the next user
2020-02-28T13:45:47  <Bosmon> This is why I am suggesting an approach based on blacklisting settings for not restoring, rather than whitelisting ones for restoring
2020-02-28T13:46:39  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: then, if we are not able to restore that blacklisted settings, we will need to leave then changed for the next user true?
2020-02-28T13:46:49  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - correct

2020-02-28T13:47:36  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: it could be highly invasive for the next user depending on the settings... like highcontrast, or the color filter themselves
2020-02-28T13:48:30  <javjarfer[m]> even if it's not going to affect them, I think that most of the users are going to expect a "clean" system, before their login operation
2020-02-28T13:48:58  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yes, this is why I am arguing for a blacklisting approach
2020-02-28T13:49:24  <Bosmon> I think we are probably saying the same thing, but let me try to be clearer
2020-02-28T13:49:47  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I'm lost, yes probably xD, please help me
2020-02-28T13:50:28  <Bosmon> We should be looking for specific reasons *not* to try to restore a setting on shutdown, based on knowing that it allocates some system resource which is not permissible, rather than just selecting a small set of known settings based on considering they are "absolutely necessary to restore"
2020-02-28T13:50:39  <Bosmon> Is that any clearer?
2020-02-28T13:55:36  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: yes, it's clearer, but if that user have used that setting, then we will leave it non-restored for the next one, and that could be highly intrusive for the next one depending on the setting
2020-02-28T13:56:27  <javjarfer[m]> so, if we have blacklisted color filters, and user login and we set the green filter, then the next user will inevitably found himself with a "green" Windows

2020-02-28T14:30:01  <jhung> Hi ayush23dash you can start by reviewing the links on this page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+with+the+Fluid+Project
2020-02-28T14:30:38  <jhung> Especially the project description, the contributor's guide, and the Jira and Github bug trackers.
2020-02-28T14:30:50  <ayush23dash> Thank you jhung
2020-02-28T14:32:22  <ayush23dash> I have seen that but my real concern is do we need to list the entire fluid project on hugo?
2020-02-28T14:33:52  <jhung> ayush23dash the project description specifically points to two websites which have github repositories. The project is to use Hugo or any other modern static site generator to facilitate the creation and maintenance of those websites.
2020-02-28T14:52:28  <ayush23dash> jhung cool I have studied the repos and I believe I can get these deployed using hugo
2020-02-28T14:53:03  <ayush23dash> Can you please inform me about how to write the proposal, I mean if any format is available?
2020-02-28T14:54:32  <ayush23dash> Moreover can you please provide your personal email(if possible) at ayushshanker23@gmail.com   as irc becomes somewhat difficult to rely on.

2020-02-28T19:12:15  <gmoss> HarshSingh[m]: colinclark may have other thoughts about your question, but here's my opinion. If you'd like to explore using a theme for the new versions of the Fluid and FLOE sites, it would be helpful to find out if those themes have any effect on accessibility and compatibility. It would also be helpful to consider how much time and effort it may save or cost a maintaining developer later down the line, i.e. it's
2020-02-28T19:12:15  <gmoss> possible that it won't be a net positive and it's worth investigating that a little before making the choice. That said, if that's how you would like to approach the project, then you can include that in your proposal and we will take it into consideration when we're evaluating everyone's applications. I hope that's helpful!
