2020-03-19T11:06:20  <the-t-in-rtf> I will, but not immediately.
2020-03-19T11:06:38  <zaidbj> No rush though,I understand the situation you mentioned in our earlier conversation
2020-03-19T11:06:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it may be early next week.
2020-03-19T11:07:29  <zaidbj> sure, thanks

2020-03-19T11:33:55  <Justin_o> greatislander: you're up early
2020-03-19T11:34:07  <greatislander> yep :)
2020-03-19T11:34:11  <Justin_o> I got a request from you regarding one of our repos.
2020-03-19T11:34:15  <greatislander> oh yeah
2020-03-19T11:34:24  <greatislander> Was it the inclusive-design/idrc one?
2020-03-19T11:34:37  <greatislander> I think it's sorted now, I was trying to set up Netlify
2020-03-19T11:35:08  <Justin_o> actually it's for the whole inclusive-design org
2020-03-19T11:35:15  <greatislander> oh, hm
2020-03-19T11:35:20  <greatislander> Was it for Netlify?
2020-03-19T11:35:23  <greatislander> or something else?
2020-03-19T11:35:58  <Justin_o> Netlify but only asking fo access to 4 repos.. although only one of them is actually marked with request
2020-03-19T11:36:05  <greatislander> hmmm
2020-03-19T11:36:13  <greatislander> I think you can safely ignore that
2020-03-19T11:36:26  <Justin_o> wecount.inclusivedesign.ca, eco-op.inclusivedesign.ca, idrc
2020-03-19T11:36:39  <greatislander> Ah okay
2020-03-19T11:36:39  <Justin_o> although the last one is listed twice with request labelled the second time
2020-03-19T11:37:02  <greatislander> The last one is the one I'm currently working on and it's been set up successfully, I think
2020-03-19T11:37:07  <greatislander> The other two are already set up
2020-03-19T11:37:26  <Justin_o> greatislander: okay, so I won't do anything for now.. let me know if you need me to accept this later though
2020-03-19T11:37:36  <Justin_o> greatislander: also, does this mean that our open source account has been approved
2020-03-19T11:37:37  <greatislander> Maybe just accept it to be on the safe side?
2020-03-19T11:37:52  <greatislander> No not yet, I'm using my personal one for the moment— I need to ping them again
2020-03-19T11:37:57  <Justin_o> okay
2020-03-19T11:38:05  <greatislander> I expect everything is running a little slower there, as everywhere
2020-03-19T11:38:10  <Justin_o> will that affect anything with this setup to switch later?
2020-03-19T11:38:22  <greatislander> Nope. I'll be able to initiate the transfer
2020-03-19T11:38:35  <sachin10101998> Justin_o could you look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/172 once
2020-03-19T11:38:38  <Justin_o> cool.. and yah, I bet everything is going a bit slower these days :(
2020-03-19T11:38:47  <Justin_o> greatislander: it's installed
2020-03-19T11:38:53  <greatislander> many thanks!
2020-03-19T11:38:58  <Justin_o> sachin10101998: thanks, I have it on my list to look at

2020-03-19T14:56:41  <Justin_o> cindyli1, clown, other GPII people: what's the best approach for making changes to Universal and testing the outcomes form the windows repo running in the vagrant VM
2020-03-19T14:57:00  <Justin_o> basically I'm trying to debug and test out some early changes to get UIO+ sending data back via the browser channel
2020-03-19T14:57:35  <clown> Justin_o:  First make sure the browser channel tests in universal still work/pass.
2020-03-19T14:59:29  <clown> after that …  I used to do something similar for linux.  Bascially, make sure your modified version of universal is within the windows "node_modules" folder.
2020-03-19T15:00:46  <clown> I mean, instead of the version of universal that is installed when you run 'npm intall' from within the windows repo
2020-03-19T15:01:08  <clown> But, there may be a better way.  Sorry, it's been a while.
2020-03-19T15:03:12  *** Saad <Saad!b6b9dda9@182.185.221.169> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2020-03-19T15:04:21  <Justin_o> clown: okay, thanks.. I made a local change straight into the file in the node_modules directory, but I didn't see it modified in the VM.. not sure if it picks it up directly or not
2020-03-19T15:05:01  <clown> Dumb question:  Is the node_modules folder in the VM mirrorring what is on your host, Justin_o?
2020-03-19T15:05:08  <clown> I sometime find they get of out sync.
2020-03-19T15:06:22  <clown> But if you changed it directly in the VM, then it should be okay
2020-03-19T15:07:31  <cindyli1> Justin_o, clown, what i usually do is, push up the universal dev branch to my git hub repo; create a windows dev branch based off the windows master; in this dev branch,  modify windows/package.json to point "gpii-universal" to my universal dev branch; start the windows VM and run "npm install" in a powershell terminal
2020-03-19T15:07:53  <cindyli1> this will pull the dev universal branch into the windows
2020-03-19T15:08:31  <clown> thanks cindyli1, that sounds familiar.  I think that's roughly the same as what I used to do with linux.  But, it's been a long time.
2020-03-19T15:08:41  <cindyli1> afterwards, for small experimental changes to the universal branch, I modify directly in windows dev branch under "windows/node_modules/universal"
2020-03-19T15:08:43  <Justin_o> cindyli1: thanks, but how can I make live changes, or I have to keep pushing up.. maybe I'll just use some npm linkage or something
2020-03-19T15:09:29  <Justin_o> cindyli1: yes, I was trying to do those experimental changes.. how do you get those into the VM, should it be picking up from the host, or you modified in the VM?
2020-03-19T15:09:39  <Justin_o> or you re-provisioned the vm
2020-03-19T15:09:47  <cindyli1> you modify on the host machine
2020-03-19T15:10:00  <cindyli1> thanks to the port mapping, all changes will be automatically picked up in VM
2020-03-19T15:10:09  *** cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2020-03-19T15:10:22  <cindyli> re-provisioning is not needed too
2020-03-19T15:12:25  <Justin_o> ah okay, I see what I was doing, I had the universal repo opened locally and thought it was the windows repo
2020-03-19T15:13:24  <cindyli> cool. great to find this kind of mistake earlier than later ;)
2020-03-19T15:17:52  <Justin_o> lol yes definitely

2020-03-19T18:13:11  <clown> Justin_o:  there is no set method.

2020-03-19T18:14:01  <Justin_o> clown: ^
2020-03-19T18:14:08  <Justin_o> clown: so only a get method
2020-03-19T18:14:10  <Justin_o> ?
2020-03-19T18:14:14  <clown> the SRDS is created as a sub-component of the flowmanager at system start.  As part of its initialization, it loads the solutions registries (from various places), and then serves them up
2020-03-19T18:14:47  <clown> Yup, only a get method.
2020-03-19T18:15:09  <clown> and, even then, it's a GET request.
2020-03-19T18:16:07  <clown> Justin_o:  I might be able to help you more if you told me what you are trying to do.
2020-03-19T18:16:14  <Justin_o> clown: okay thanks for the info, that saved me a ton of time for looking.
2020-03-19T18:16:37  <Justin_o> I think it's okay for now, but if you are interested, I'm trying to send back settings from UIO+ to morphic over the web socket, browser channel.
2020-03-19T18:17:06  <clown> I have to put myself in the frame of mind of the current master implementation of the SRDS, not the changes I am implementing.
2020-03-19T18:17:22  <Justin_o> :)
2020-03-19T18:18:04  <clown> So:  the current SRDS is "simple": all of the solutions registries are in "%universal/testData/solutions", and that's where the SRDS loads them from.
2020-03-19T18:18:42  <Justin_o> clown: actually in reading the code again, I think I don't need it.. it's just being used to ensure that there is an entry for the solution.. I thought it was retrieving the settings too, but that is being done by something else.
2020-03-19T18:18:54  <clown> you will see individual registries in there for "win32", "linux", etc.
2020-03-19T18:19:25  <clown> Justin_o:  I dunno.  It sometimes feels to me that everything in gpii is "done by something else".
2020-03-19T18:20:25  <Justin_o> haha.. well i'm finding that some of the things I thought I was going to have to do was already done by something else, so that can be a good thing :)
2020-03-19T18:20:36  <clown> Justin_o:  you added a comment the other day to my PR for GPII-2440 confirming the that UIO+ solutions were not part of the 'web' registry, but were in the win32 and linux registries.
2020-03-19T18:20:56  <Justin_o> clown: yes
2020-03-19T18:21:10  <clown> so, do you need to change that, or change parts of that?
2020-03-19T18:21:42  <Justin_o> clown: not for this work I'm doing now.. I don't think.. but I do have an open PR to modify the solutions registry entry for removing the captions preferences
2020-03-19T18:22:33  <clown> okay..  that shouldn't have any effect on the SRDS component itself.  It doesn't care about the contents..  It's there to load and serve that content.
2020-03-19T18:23:19  <clown> Maybe Tony's work on "live solutions registries" is more relevant, even if only slightly so.
2020-03-19T18:24:07  <clown> Okay.  It sounds like you have path forward.  Let me know if you have any more questions.
