2019-07-15T14:22:48  <Justin_o> alanharnum, simonjb, gmoss and anyone else who may have thoughts on this or used Infusion recently to make a website: I'm looking into https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6359
2019-07-15T14:23:43  <Justin_o> Do you have examples of your recent use, and if you have any thoughts on your experience that you could share. Do you like the current setup, is there something you'd prefer?
2019-07-15T14:31:48  <alanharnum> Justin_o: I commented on the JIRA issue, but I think all assets necessary to use an Infusion component should be present in /dist
2019-07-15T14:32:02  <alanharnum> If we make this change we'll need to make sure to update documentation on UIO, etc.
2019-07-15T14:33:43  <Justin_o> alanharnum: what does FE stand for?
2019-07-15T14:33:54  <alanharnum> "for example"

2019-07-15T15:00:54  <cindyli> Bosmon: i'm ready to pick up another JIRA to work on. here's the ones on my to do list:
2019-07-15T15:00:56  <cindyli> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3936 - Prevent the security issue with using a USB with NOVA computers to create GPII key and prefs safe
2019-07-15T15:00:56  <cindyli> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3958 - Implement new API and core function to allow reread of settings during session
2019-07-15T15:00:56  <cindyli> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3791 - Race condition in LifecycleManager session
2019-07-15T15:00:56  <cindyli> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3117 - Remove the environment reporter and adjust context manager accordingly
2019-07-15T15:02:04  <cindyli> I'll start on the first one: GPII-3936. Please let me know if you think the 2nd one GPII-3958 or any other things have higher priority. thanks

2019-07-15T15:03:29  <Bosmon> cindyli - sounds good
2019-07-15T15:03:44  <Bosmon> Where are we with respect to pushing your IP range checking impl through testing on staging?
2019-07-15T15:03:49  <Bosmon> Is your migration script ready for that?
2019-07-15T15:04:02  <cindyli> Bosmon: yes, it is ready
2019-07-15T15:05:19  <cindyli> i've deployed the GPII-4017 branch, which is the 0.2 schema version after the migration, to my dev cluster and waiting for Javi to test. i will inform Kavya too
2019-07-15T15:07:11  <cindyli> once this is done, we'll have a meeting to talk about migration details, such as all tests that should be performed after the migration
2019-07-15T15:07:33  <cindyli> then do a test run on someone's dev cluster
2019-07-15T15:08:05  <cindyli> if everything looks good, we'll do the migration on the staging then production
2019-07-15T15:10:10  <cindyli> Bosmon: let me know if this plan can be polished
2019-07-15T15:10:12  <cindyli> so while waiting for ppl to test, i can work on another jira
2019-07-15T15:10:58  <Bosmon> cindyli - sounds great, well done :)
2019-07-15T15:11:24  <cindyli> as always ;)
2019-07-15T15:12:29  <Bosmon> cindyli - what were you thinking of doing for GPII-3791?
2019-07-15T15:18:06  <cindyli> hard to answer. thinking...
2019-07-15T15:27:26  <cindyli> Bosmon: the error is thrown from writeJournal() which is triggered when there's a model change at lifecycleManager.session.originalSettings. The error is about session.createTime === undefined, in which case I think writeJournal() should not be triggered at all. It might be possible that createTime is set too late after the model change is fired for lifecycleManager.session.originalSettings. i think one fix is too ensure createTime h
2019-07-15T15:27:26  <cindyli> as been set properly before this model change

2019-07-15T15:28:03  <cindyli> I need to re-reproduce the problem to prove this concept
2019-07-15T15:28:18  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you think this one should be fixed first?
2019-07-15T15:29:18  <Bosmon> cindyli - I wasn't sure what part of the work was actually left
2019-07-15T15:29:37  <Bosmon> It certainly doesn't seem more urgent than either of the top two items
2019-07-15T15:30:08  <cindyli> Bosmon: you suggested making session a dynamic component, but also as you said in the jira comment, this may not be the cause of the problem, but will be an architectural improvement
2019-07-15T15:30:22  <Bosmon> cindyli - oh yes, I forgot that this hadn't actually been done
2019-07-15T15:30:39  <cindyli> no, not yet
2019-07-15T15:31:21  <cindyli> Bosmon: shall this be done first?
2019-07-15T15:31:30  <Bosmon> cindyli, I don't think so, it is a bit unfathomable
2019-07-15T15:31:53  <Bosmon> And if people aren't complaining about the underlying issue at the live sites, we should push it out
2019-07-15T15:31:53  <cindyli> :)
2019-07-15T15:32:12  <cindyli> ok. i will leave an on hold flag for this jira

2019-07-15T18:18:07  <Justin_o> sure, I can try to help. Cindy or Joseph might also be able to help.
2019-07-15T18:18:19  <gmoss> cindyli, clown ^^
2019-07-15T18:18:54  <cindyli> what's the problem, gmoss?
2019-07-15T18:19:11  <cindyli> do you have a branch to demonstrate it?
2019-07-15T18:19:46  <gmoss> cindyli: I'm trying to set up a test that uses a different config file and the test accesses a route I added recently. the test returns a 404 when I expect a 200. the route works in my browser. I'll find a link to the relevant code

2019-07-15T18:23:17  <gmoss> cindyli: thanks. In reviewing the Kettle docs and the differences between this failing test and the two other working kettle tests, I'm not sure what I'm missing
2019-07-15T18:23:23  <gmoss> maybe a bit of code myopia
2019-07-15T18:30:51  <cindyli> gmoss: the problem is because, "{server}.options.globalConfig.uploadedFilesHandlerPath" used at this line - https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blob/SJRK-237/src/server/serverSetup.js#L203, is not provided
2019-07-15T18:31:14  <cindyli> if you commented out these lines: https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-story-telling/blob/SJRK-237/src/server/serverSetup.js#L199-L203, your test will pass
2019-07-15T18:32:37  <gmoss> cindyli: good catch! I forgot that kettle with go through the requestHandlers key in order, and the uploadsHandler is ahead of my new route in the list
2019-07-15T18:32:46  <cindyli> exactly
2019-07-15T18:32:53  <gmoss> the basic tests only check node_modules so it never reaches that handler
2019-07-15T18:35:06  <gmoss> well at least it's a quick fix. the test is passing now :) thanks cindyli!
2019-07-15T18:36:50  <cindyli> anytime :)

2019-07-15T20:02:12  <Bosmon> Hey there gmoss - did you ever get to the bottom of your static middleware routing issues?
2019-07-15T20:02:24  <gmoss> Bosmon: yes i did, thanks :)
2019-07-15T20:02:29  <Bosmon> gmoss - what was the issue?
2019-07-15T20:03:03  <gmoss> Bosmon: it had to do with the specific order of the entries in the requestHandlers key in the kettle.app
2019-07-15T20:03:19  <gmoss> which was not something I found in the docs. I've filed a Jira to update the docs accordingly
2019-07-15T20:03:34  <gmoss> (at least I believe I did, let me find it to make sure...)
2019-07-15T20:03:36  <Bosmon> gmoss - sounds worrying
2019-07-15T20:04:08  <gmoss> Bosmon: I think it would be preferable to have a priority system, as that would be in keeping with other infusion things
2019-07-15T20:05:12  <Bosmon> gmoss - I had assumed there was one, but indeed it seems there isn't
2019-07-15T20:05:21  <Bosmon> That's a great suggestion for an improvement
2019-07-15T20:05:29  <Bosmon> Do you think you could write up a JIRA explaining your experience?
2019-07-15T20:06:48  <gmoss> Bosmon: sure. I can't seem to find the Jira I thought I'd created, I must not have. I'll put something together :)
2019-07-15T20:06:59  <gmoss> it tripped me up today as well
2019-07-15T20:08:21  <Bosmon> gmoss - that would be awesome, thanks!
2019-07-15T20:10:08  <gmoss> Bosmon: it might be a little bit before I get to writing it, do you have a preferred method to be notified?
2019-07-15T20:10:55  *** cherylhjli <cherylhjli!~Adium@142.118.172.60> has joined #fluid-work
2019-07-15T20:11:52  <Bosmon> gmoss - I probably get notifications of issues assigned to me
2019-07-15T20:12:02  <Bosmon> If not, I'm sure I get ones that I have a @mention in
2019-07-15T20:12:45  <gmoss> Bosmon: okay, I'll see what fits best once I've written it :)
