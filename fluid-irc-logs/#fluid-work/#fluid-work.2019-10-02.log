2019-10-02T12:12:22  <Bosmon> Hi there yanachkov__ - are you there?
2019-10-02T12:12:46  <yanachkov__> Yup
2019-10-02T12:12:47  <yanachkov__> Hi
2019-10-02T12:12:50  <Bosmon> Hey there!
2019-10-02T12:13:14  <Bosmon> So I'm just going through the way the QSS renders itself
2019-10-02T12:13:27  <Bosmon> Via gpii.qss.list, gpii.qss.repeater, etc.
2019-10-02T12:13:54  <Bosmon> I just wanted to confirm what impression I'm getting from the code, although this doesn't quite agree with what I seem to see of the QSS in use....
2019-10-02T12:14:06  <Bosmon> Is it right that the QSS cannot dynamically add and remove buttons from itself whilst in use?
2019-10-02T12:15:02  <Bosmon> It seems to take its original population of buttons from the "params.settings" when gpii.qss constructs, and it registers a bunch of listeners on them
2019-10-02T12:15:36  <yanachkov__> I think cannot.
2019-10-02T12:16:08  <Bosmon> But from what I see in gpii.qss.repeater there doesn't seem to be anything which can actually create or destroy an entire gpii.psp.repeater.element except on startup, right?
2019-10-02T12:16:54  <yanachkov__> I'll check now
2019-10-02T12:17:33  <Bosmon> yanachkov__ - thanks - but I was just wanting to confirm my impression of normal use of the QSS - the buttons don't appear and disappear dynamically, right, for example when you key in and key out?
2019-10-02T12:17:39  <Bosmon> All that happens is that they get disabled and enabled?
2019-10-02T12:19:34  <yanachkov__> at least I don't know about the way to dynamically add or remove buttons
2019-10-02T12:21:55  <yanachkov__> And yes, now only changing the behaviour of the buttons
2019-10-02T12:22:03  <Bosmon> yanachkov__ - ok, good to confirm that
2019-10-02T12:22:31  <Bosmon> So it looks like this could be another useful benefit of doing the Infusion upgrade, since I think that Gregg will probably want dynamically updatable buttons before long
2019-10-02T12:23:25  <Bosmon> The more I am going through this code, the more stuff I am finding that is technically invalid in the old framework, such as this definition: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/renderer/common/js/elementRepeater.js#L177
2019-10-02T12:23:31  <Bosmon> I'm quite amazed this ever worked : P
2019-10-02T12:26:59  <yanachkov__> Yup, there is many things which can be updated, but as always, time is not enough :)

2019-10-02T15:22:43  <jhung> Justin_o got a github question for you. Is there any way to change a Review once it's submitted? I accidentally submitted a Review as a Comment, but wanted to make it Request Changes.
2019-10-02T15:23:09  <Justin_o> jhung: can you send me the example

2019-10-02T15:25:41  <jhung> Not quite what I want - I was wondering if there was a better way to manage and edit reviews. I can't seem to go back and add to a review after the fact either. It seems very limited.

2019-10-02T16:59:07  <sgithens> Bosmon: When there is a solutions entry like this, is the expansion mechanism for it fairly independent somewhere? Is it an infusion function or a gpii function? ```"options": {
2019-10-02T16:59:07  <sgithens>                     // TODO: Create a base grade for JAWS and version-specific variations.  Make JAWS 2019 the default.  Restart version-detection discussions and "capability" discussions.
2019-10-02T16:59:07  <sgithens>                     "filename": "${{environment}.APPDATA}\\Freedom Scientific\\JAWS\\2019\\Settings\\VoiceProfiles\\GPII.VPF"```
2019-10-02T16:59:37  <sgithens> I want to expand it outside of the entire lifecycle process
2019-10-02T16:59:56  <sgithens> to fill in the string template, with the environment path
2019-10-02T17:03:19  <Bosmon> sgithens - it is expanded via a call to this resolver: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L56
2019-10-02T17:04:11  <Bosmon> You can't very well expand it outside the lifecycle process since how would you know what the environment was?
2019-10-02T17:04:22  <Bosmon> You know that some of these refer to the user's logon token, right?
2019-10-02T17:04:49  <Bosmon> And others refer to stuff that has been dumped into the session by settings handlers
2019-10-02T17:04:53  <sgithens> sure, but clearly this is just the system env variables
2019-10-02T17:04:57  <Bosmon> What's your use case for expanding them outside the lifecycle?
2019-10-02T17:05:00  <Bosmon> IN THIS CASE IT IS
2019-10-02T17:05:17  <sgithens> this is the fluid.template syntax right?
2019-10-02T17:05:33  <Bosmon> I don't know which fluid.template you mean
2019-10-02T17:05:40  <sgithens> string template
2019-10-02T17:05:50  <sgithens> or maybe it's not, I've never used it directly
2019-10-02T17:06:07  <sgithens> the context variable replacement
2019-10-02T17:06:26  <sgithens> surely we have some function which does this, and in this case the context I provide it would have the environment
2019-10-02T17:07:46  <Bosmon> Yes we do
2019-10-02T17:07:58  <Bosmon> And while I dig it up, could you kindly explain your use case? : P
2019-10-02T17:08:12  <sgithens> I'm working on this JAWS stuff
2019-10-02T17:08:32  <sgithens> where for the specific purpose of capturing settings, I need to look up the default voice profile
2019-10-02T17:08:47  <Bosmon> You need the STUF in this file: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/Resolvers.js
2019-10-02T17:09:05  <sgithens> ah cool
2019-10-02T17:09:11  <sgithens> cheers to the max
2019-10-02T17:09:11  <Bosmon> Which in itself is self-contained enough
2019-10-02T17:09:50  <Bosmon> You then create a "fetcher" by replicating this call only with an empty hash: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L144
2019-10-02T17:10:09  <Bosmon> And then from that create a "resolver" like this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L138
2019-10-02T17:12:42  <sgithens> awesome

2019-10-02T18:50:58  <sgithens> cindyli: on a random question, since everyone there got new macbooks, do you guys have any issues with virtualbox rebooting your macbooks?
2019-10-02T18:51:22  <sgithens> notably when you're booting a windows 10 vm
2019-10-02T18:51:54  <cindyli> not sure about other ppl. but I haven't experienced this problem. but i haven't upgraded vitualbox to the latest release yet
2019-10-02T18:52:16  <sgithens> I downgraded to the version you were using and I still have the issue
2019-10-02T18:52:24  <cindyli> oh, noo
2019-10-02T18:52:43  <sgithens> everytime JAWS needs to reboot because it's 40 minute mode, I grip the table in fear and pray that my machine doesn't freeze
2019-10-02T18:53:03  <cindyli> poor guy :-D
2019-10-02T18:53:27  <sgithens> it hasn't happend the last couple times, knock on wood, but for a while it seemed like a coin flip chance
2019-10-02T18:54:26  <sgithens> cindyli: What are looking at in particular for these settings? Is it another usage of the capture API that you're playing with?
2019-10-02T18:55:09  <cindyli> sgithens: there seems a virtualbox bug ticket for this issue - https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/18107?cversion=0&cnum_hist=4
2019-10-02T18:55:42  <cindyli> sgithens: yes, i grab a part of your capturing function to create a new lifecycle manager API called read()
2019-10-02T18:56:18  <sgithens> oh cool
2019-10-02T18:56:22  <cindyli> this API only reads settings. the next step is to convert its output back to the preference form i believe
2019-10-02T18:56:36  <cindyli> was thinking if you have done this, i can simply copy paste ;)
2019-10-02T18:56:43  <sgithens> yes...
2019-10-02T18:56:58  <sgithens> if I tested it at all with keying back in it seems I would have had to do this
2019-10-02T18:57:49  <sgithens> thanks for the ticket link
2019-10-02T18:58:01  <cindyli> looking at the "capabilityTransformation" blocks in win32.json5, seems it's not easy to satisfy all the inverse transformation for all settings
2019-10-02T19:00:13  <cindyli> gmoss: i'm playing with "cities" theme and noticed even if "authoringEnabled" is set to true, the editing is not enabled on the site. is this expected behaviour?
2019-10-02T19:01:07  <gmoss> cindyli: the button to get to the edit page has been removed, but if you navigate to storyEdit.html manually you should still be able to author and save a story
2019-10-02T19:01:54  <cindyli> oh, there's a different way to control the editing with cities site. why?
2019-10-02T19:02:11  <cindyli> i mean why not using "authoringEnabled" flag?
2019-10-02T19:03:29  <cindyli> gmoss: ^
2019-10-02T19:03:58  <gmoss> cindyli: the flag doesn't control whether that link appears or not, since on the floe production site we still want to have the link present but going to the staging site, so even though we've already disabled editing on the cities site, the button was still present. since we know we won't be collecting any more stories on that site, we've removed it from there. I realize now that removing it will disable that button
2019-10-02T19:03:58  <gmoss> for all instances of the tool, which is not ideal.
2019-10-02T19:04:12  <gmoss> *all instances that merge this version of the code in
2019-10-02T19:04:23  <cindyli> i see
2019-10-02T19:04:25  <gmoss> I think I have an idea
2019-10-02T19:05:50  <gmoss> cindyli: scratch that, I take back what I said about other versions being affected. this is only present in the cities theme, since it has its own template for the site masthead
2019-10-02T19:05:58  <gmoss> as do the others
2019-10-02T19:06:27  <gmoss> sorry for the confusion, cindyli!
2019-10-02T19:06:41  <cindyli> i wonder with cities, if we could continue to present the button that leads to a page saying the editing is not available due to blahblah...
2019-10-02T19:07:06  <cindyli> so that all themes have consistent behaviour
2019-10-02T19:07:55  <cindyli> unless cities site has no intention at all for ppl to add stories
2019-10-02T19:08:23  <gmoss> cindyli: for the cities site, the intention is for it to simply be a repository of the stories we collected, and there won't be any new ones from now on
2019-10-02T19:08:35  <gmoss> so that's right, we don't intend for any new stories to be added
2019-10-02T19:08:39  <gmoss> to the cities one only
2019-10-02T19:08:48  <cindyli> i see. good to know
2019-10-02T19:09:05  <gmoss> cindyli: i suppose I should have added some context on the PR
2019-10-02T19:09:37  <cindyli> gmoss: i think it would be helpful to explain all these in a documenation in the repo
2019-10-02T19:10:21  <gmoss> cindyli: that's a good idea. the documentation doesn't have entries for the two new themes
2019-10-02T19:10:36  <cindyli> would be nice to add that too
2019-10-02T19:10:43  <gmoss> I'll add that to the SJRK-297 branch
2019-10-02T19:13:59  <cindyli> gmoss: since you are fixing docs, i added another comment to the SJRK-297 pull request
2019-10-02T19:14:14  <gmoss> cindyli: okay, i'll check it out :)
2019-10-02T19:14:17  <cindyli> thanks
