2019-09-03T14:24:43  <danielcho> Justin_o: nope, we haven't seen that one yet
2019-09-03T14:24:56  <Justin_o> and this is another one they make https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper
2019-09-03T14:25:01  <Justin_o> they're probably both expensive
2019-09-03T14:25:06  <Justin_o> but they seem to do a lot
2019-09-03T14:25:33  <danielcho> yeah they seem really expensive
2019-09-03T14:26:03  <danielcho> hopefully what I am doing with IoT platforms can support some complex skills like those ones

2019-09-03T14:31:36  <danielcho> Justin_o: their vision is really similar to our it seems and yeah, they are connected to cloud-based services and APIs
2019-09-03T14:33:06  <Justin_o> looks like they can be used as both teaching aids themselves and tools for learning. At any rate, I think the features of the robot itself provide for many options. It would be interesting to see how you progress with your work on IoT.
2019-09-03T14:33:19  <danielcho> So I was thinking either build an IoT accessories that can be attached to the robots we have or build a wearable to assist users â€” still really early stage, but I am positive about what we could do with cloud-based services
2019-09-03T14:33:53  <danielcho> yeah for sure!
2019-09-03T14:34:16  <Justin_o> danielcho: both those approaches could be interesting and provide for more customization and feature support
2019-09-03T14:34:36  <Justin_o> I wonder how hard it is to build Alexa support for example.

2019-09-03T14:36:27  <danielcho> I was actually trying to build one, but couldn't get through the certification on AWS; though I realized that the Arduino firmware was outdated, and I needed to update it to go through Google Cloud IoT as well, so I might try AWS one again
2019-09-03T14:36:47  <Justin_o> ah okay.. hopefully that was it for the issue you ran into the other day
2019-09-03T14:36:54  <danielcho> hopefully

2019-09-03T16:55:34  <Justin_o> gmoss, michelled: I was looking over Google Code-In. So it's a bit different than I thought. The tasks don't have to be code fixes. They can be Code, Documentation/Training, Outreach/Research, Quality/Assurance, or Design. They should only take 3 - 5 hours to complete though. https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/faq#what_is_a_task
2019-09-03T16:56:18  <Justin_o> I wonder if there is some more broader work that we could put under these.. perhaps some co-design, QA, etc.
2019-09-03T17:05:43  <gmoss> Justin_o: maybe docs? although that might be better done as part of GSoD. It could be things like switching code comments to JSDoc?
2019-09-03T17:05:56  <gmoss> It's good to know it isn't narrowly limited to bug fixes, all the same
2019-09-03T17:06:44  <Justin_o> gmoss: yep, I can see it being useful to get QA work on some of our sites or tools we are developing too
2019-09-03T17:07:55  <Justin_o> Bosmon: regarding this comment, I'm not sure how I'd kick off the creation of the subcomponents though. Or are you suggesting that each menu item shouldn't be wrapped with a component?

2019-09-03T17:22:30  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the creation of the subcomponents will kick off by itself!
2019-09-03T17:22:33  <Bosmon> You just need to define them
2019-09-03T17:23:13  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think I'm confused, how could this happen automatically and yet still follow the order I specify?
2019-09-03T17:24:33  <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can't control the order of the subcomponents, you will just need to collect them together once they have arrived
2019-09-03T17:25:19  <Justin_o> Bosmon: and then trigger the call to the chrome api through them in a specific order?
2019-09-03T17:25:30  <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2019-09-03T17:26:25  <Justin_o> hmm.. okay.. I'll look into that

2019-09-03T18:52:38  <gmoss> Justin_o: I've left another comment on the SJRK-268 PR. I'm not sure there's an easy path forward without trying to get Sinon working again, which may be non-trivial
2019-09-03T18:53:00  <gmoss> considering $.getScript may be doing things Sinon doesn't expect, as we've discussed
2019-09-03T18:57:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: just finishing up some changes, but I'll take a look in a bit
2019-09-03T18:58:25  <gmoss> Justin_o: no worries. I'm reading up about the interaction between jQuery AJAX and Sinon, at the moment
2019-09-03T19:43:49  <Justin_o> gmoss: did you want to chat about $.getScript. I'm not sure I'm completely understanding how it's being used in your code.
