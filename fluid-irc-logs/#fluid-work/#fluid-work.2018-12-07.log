2018-12-07T09:29:36  <the-t-in-rtf> So, I'm onboarding MAGic, but whenever I try to key in using the pref set it still tries to write JAWS settings
2018-12-07T09:29:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm trying to figure out why

2018-12-07T11:25:08  <javjarfer[m]> Good Friday morning Bosmon ! I have addressed the latest feedback, you can see the changes in the pad
2018-12-07T11:25:19  <javjarfer[m]> https://pad.gpii.net/p/jjs-pull-status-67c4nr5
2018-12-07T11:34:55  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - yup, work is ongoing!
2018-12-07T11:35:02  <Bosmon> Looks like we are going to have a massive sweep of these today
2018-12-07T11:35:03  <dandimitrov> hey, stegru, me again
2018-12-07T11:35:18  <stegru> hi
2018-12-07T11:35:36  <dandimitrov> tried the latest version of GPII-3544 - here’s a little something  https://pastebin.com/cNpiPbFe : )
2018-12-07T11:36:04  <dandimitrov> Looks like the trouble comes from here - https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/0e8a5e3f82ad8f321e895abb80f27444e27e8835/gpii/node_modules/gpii-localisation/src/language.js#L279
2018-12-07T11:39:09  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: that will be great, moving to new stuff!
2018-12-07T11:42:05  <stegru> dandimitrov, try it now :)
2018-12-07T11:42:59  <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon, would you have the time today to take a look at our Morphic 1.0.1 PR :?
2018-12-07T11:45:35  <dandimitrov> stegru: nope :/
2018-12-07T11:45:36  <dandimitrov> https://pastebin.com/cs9mhXqL
2018-12-07T11:47:23  <the-t-in-rtf> So, my latest theory was correct, I have inverse transforms in my solution that produce a common term that in turn is transformed to JAWS-specific settings
2018-12-07T11:48:37  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - sure
2018-12-07T11:48:41  <javjarfer[m]> Nice catch with the retrying Bosmon , I will remove all the present in that pull and will update others
2018-12-07T11:48:55  <stegru> dandimitrov - now?
2018-12-07T11:49:18  <stegru> If I keep entering random pieces of code, it will eventually work
2018-12-07T11:52:19  <dandimitrov> stegru: flawlessly ;)
2018-12-07T11:53:18  <dandimitrov> everything seems ok now

2018-12-07T11:59:19  <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, is there a better code page to use than 65001 for logging console output with tee?
2018-12-07T11:59:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I still have to run the results through dos2unix on the OSX side, and not just for the CR/LFs
2018-12-07T12:01:22  <stegru> using powershell tee? I don't know
2018-12-07T12:02:08  <stegru> i usually do "> log", then "tail -f log" on the host
2018-12-07T12:02:14  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - looks pretty good to me, only a few minor comments and bumps of a couple of old comments
2018-12-07T12:04:02  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf, stegru: `tee` doesn’t work in case you force quit the application
2018-12-07T12:04:42  <the-t-in-rtf> redirecting to a file does?
2018-12-07T12:04:58  <dandimitrov> I use cmder (instead of powershell) on the VM with two windows like the approach stegru suggested
2018-12-07T12:05:03  <dandimitrov> yep
2018-12-07T12:05:44  <dandimitrov> “tee” command never writes to file in case the previous command doens’t finish
2018-12-07T12:05:52  <dandimitrov> or so it looks to me

2018-12-07T12:19:51  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf, one other thing I use - In case the logs are flooding you could also try `tail -f .log | grep -A 5 -e "<message1 prefix>" -e "<message2 prefix>" …` to see only console.logs you need
2018-12-07T12:19:57  *** alf_ is now known as amatas
2018-12-07T12:20:23  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I can't do that because the encoding is borked
2018-12-07T12:20:52  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe I can pipe it through dos2unix in real time on my end
2018-12-07T12:21:17  <the-t-in-rtf> there are also options to force proper BOM-less utf8 encoding in powershell, but I'd have to do that every time I recreate the VM

2018-12-07T12:22:26  <amatas> Hi Bosmon, the ops team was revisiting some issues in our backlog. We were wondering about the status of https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3309 and https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3310 . Can you give us how is the progress of both issues?
2018-12-07T12:22:55  <the-t-in-rtf> But this works:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40098771/changing-powershells-default-output-encoding-to-utf-8
2018-12-07T12:28:07  <javjarfer[m]> HI Bosmon regarding to this comment https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/636#discussion_r239781017, are you referring to every "fluid.transform.value" with no input?
2018-12-07T12:28:19  <javjarfer[m]> Should I remove all the inverses in the SR like those?
2018-12-07T12:32:39  <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf, yeah, I also had troubles with the encoding - using http://cmder.net/ instead of PowerShell fixed that for me
2018-12-07T12:34:15  <the-t-in-rtf> interesting, thanks.

2018-12-07T12:51:03  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, so I'm now stuck with the registry resolver apparently returning undefined for various solutions
2018-12-07T12:51:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I see stuff like:
2018-12-07T12:51:06  <the-t-in-rtf>                 "setTrue": [
2018-12-07T12:51:06  <the-t-in-rtf>                     {

2018-12-07T12:51:06  <the-t-in-rtf>                     }
2018-12-07T12:51:07  <the-t-in-rtf>                 ],
2018-12-07T12:51:19  <the-t-in-rtf> that's for an entry I haven't changed, JAWS 2018
2018-12-07T12:51:28  <the-t-in-rtf> which used to launch when I onboarded it
2018-12-07T12:51:55  <the-t-in-rtf> that should be resolving from the registry:
2018-12-07T12:51:55  <the-t-in-rtf> "command": "\"${{registry}.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\JAWS2018.exe\\}\""
2018-12-07T12:52:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I see that nvda and others use the registry resolver
2018-12-07T12:53:16  <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, I suspect that it's simply that it's trying to launch JAWS because of the crosswalk and not able to find the registry key

2018-12-07T15:23:01  <Justin_o> alanharnum: here's the branch with my work https://github.com/jobara/infusion-docs/tree/FLUID-6324
2018-12-07T15:23:54  <Justin_o> still have the same issue. When you run "docpad run" it only creates an empty "out" directory. When you run "docpad generate" it throws an error because it can't find the handlebar helpers that are configured in docpad.js
2018-12-07T15:25:58  <Justin_o> alanharnum: this could be related to the docpad v6.24.0 change ( https://libupdate.com/libs/b9b44047-be7a-4e8c-888b-e4553f57abad ) to how configuring is set with setConfig. But the plugin appears to have been updated for that. Also the plugin's documentation ( https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-handlebars/blob/master/README.md#getting-helpers-and-partials-to-work ) and tests (
2018-12-07T15:25:58  <Justin_o> https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-handlebars/blob/master/test/docpad.coffee ) both appear to show that our setup is correct.
2018-12-07T15:26:26  <alanharnum> Justin_o: OK, I'll have a look myself and see if I can figure anything out
2018-12-07T15:27:02  <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks.. please let me know if you do. If i have time later today I'll try to look into it again some more.

2018-12-07T15:59:07  <stegru> what about also including #222, the tray button? it's not ready to be merged, but it's ready for "internal testing"
2018-12-07T15:59:20  <stegru> when do you plan on producing this build, jhernandez ?
2018-12-07T15:59:24  <jhernandez> I guess we also should include it as part of our gpii organization in github
2018-12-07T15:59:30  <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks for that
2018-12-07T15:59:31  <stegru> yeh
2018-12-07T15:59:50  <jhernandez> stegru: I can work tonight on creating one with whatever we want to include
2018-12-07T16:00:04  <jhernandez> it's starting to become a tradition
2018-12-07T16:00:35  <jhernandez> wait until the next is over and put things together and see if it's feasible or not to produce a meaningful installer
2018-12-07T16:00:36  <jhernandez> :P
2018-12-07T16:00:57  <stegru> heh yes
2018-12-07T16:01:24  <jhernandez> *until the week is over
2018-12-07T16:01:51  <jhernandez> in an hour or so I'll be heading to the airport
2018-12-07T16:02:12  <stegru> well, i'm going to the chippy soon
2018-12-07T16:02:38  <jhernandez> and I'll have diner with him
2018-12-07T16:02:53  <jhernandez> but I can put the pieces together at night
2018-12-07T16:03:30  <stegru> ok ping ming just before you start getting it together
2018-12-07T16:03:36  <stegru> or ping me
2018-12-07T16:03:49  <jhernandez> stegru: chippy = fish and chips place?
2018-12-07T16:03:58  <stegru> yes, that's right
2018-12-07T16:14:35  <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - how are you getting on?
2018-12-07T16:14:39  <Bosmon> What is on your plate at the moment
2018-12-07T16:16:04  <cindyli> Bosmon: working on this one - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3424
2018-12-07T16:16:33  <Bosmon> cindyli - wow, cool
2018-12-07T16:17:08  <cindyli> Bosmon: nothing urgent in my plate. let me know if you are aware of something that is more urgent?
2018-12-07T16:18:17  <Bosmon> cindyli - something for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3396 since currently I always comment out that test whenever I test a pull : P
2018-12-07T16:18:31  <Bosmon> But similarly not urgent
2018-12-07T16:20:47  <cindyli> the difficulty with GPII-3396 is I never successfully reproduced the failure
2018-12-07T16:25:20  <bryan_> @Bosmon: I'm trying that new VM to see if it fixes my issue

2018-12-07T16:25:47  <jhernandez> stegru: re the tray button, I can include it, yes - just one thing, we want to configure gpii-app to ONLY use the new tray button, right?
2018-12-07T16:26:04  <stegru> I don't know about that
2018-12-07T16:26:11  <stegru> i presume so
2018-12-07T16:26:16  <jhernandez> okay

2018-12-07T21:32:35  <stegru> jhernandez, I have nothing else for your installer.. just gpii-app#70 + gpii-windows#222 for the tray button
2018-12-07T21:33:37  <stegru> if you're including the 1.0.1 branch from astea, then you'll also need gpii-windows#223 (gpii-3544)

2018-12-07T22:07:54  <jhernandez> yeah, I was planning to include 1.0.1 branch from Astea
2018-12-07T22:08:00  <jhernandez> thanks for the heads up!
2018-12-07T22:08:19  <jhernandez> I'll let you know over the weekend
2018-12-07T22:08:54  <jhernandez> and thanks for the great job!
