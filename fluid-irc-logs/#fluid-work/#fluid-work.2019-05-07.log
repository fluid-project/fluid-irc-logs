2019-05-07T15:54:39  <jhung> cindyli: you can look into this conversation I had with the-t-in-rtf and alanharnum last week about getting docpad to run http://irc-logs.fluidproject.org/%23fluid-work/%23fluid-work.2019-04-29.log
2019-05-07T15:56:00  <jhung> alanharnum: I noticed you were looking into webpub for CISL. You might want to talk to greatislander about webpub in Pressbooks. He might be able to give you some insight.
2019-05-07T15:59:09  <cindyli> cool. thanks, jhung

2019-05-07T16:30:08  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhung, in later work I noticed that windows doesn't do well with npm run alone and binaries, at least not in VMs
2019-05-07T16:30:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I ended up using the full node syntax, i.e. node node_modules/docpad/path/to/binary.js arg1 arg2 etc
2019-05-07T16:30:49  <the-t-in-rtf> I think it was also broken for Antranig
