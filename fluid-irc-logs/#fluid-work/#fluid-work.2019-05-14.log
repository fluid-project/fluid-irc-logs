2019-05-14T11:06:10  <javjarfer[m]> hi there Bosmon ! Good morning, sorry, I updated the pull request you commented yesterday, I spent some time looking into your request, should be possible but wanted to know if it's really necessary
2019-05-14T11:34:15  <javjarfer[m]> Hi there Bosmon , I have also combine the project output to one single folder as you asked, so I think pull should be again ready!

2019-05-14T12:46:06  <the-t-in-rtf> I am filling in missing schemas for the typing enhancement block by reviewing the controls that set things
2019-05-14T12:46:24  <stegru> ok
2019-05-14T12:46:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I just wanted to confirm, that setting doesn't appear to be reachable from the control panel in Windows 10
2019-05-14T12:46:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I just wanted to ask if that setting and the two shift settings were desired and known working
2019-05-14T12:46:51  <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect not
2019-05-14T12:47:00  <the-t-in-rtf> and would like to make the case for "overboarding" them
2019-05-14T12:47:17  <stegru> it's possible.. javjarfer[m] can confirm
2019-05-14T12:47:31  <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect they may have worked in a much earlier version of windows
2019-05-14T12:47:39  <the-t-in-rtf> we have been at this for a while
2019-05-14T12:48:39  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I'll comment them out to see if anything breaks and leave a TODO comment
2019-05-14T12:48:47  <the-t-in-rtf> and will at mention you both once it's committed
2019-05-14T12:48:49  <javjarfer[m]> hi the-t-in-rtf
2019-05-14T12:51:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I have to pack up now, will take my answer offline and/or loop you into the pull once the TODOs are committed
2019-05-14T12:51:34  <the-t-in-rtf> most of this is just flagging things for cleanup in the next pull
2019-05-14T12:52:01  <the-t-in-rtf> labelling everything with primer cord and adding the explosives later
2019-05-14T12:56:55  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: so, I think you are only able to reach that things from control panel if you have a touch-screen device

2019-05-14T14:30:40  <cindyli> javjarfer[m], Bosmon, i've gone thru all "capabilitiesTransformations" blocks in win32.json5 and find out there are numerous input paths handling application specific terms starting with "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/applications" such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4762
2019-05-14T14:30:52  <cindyli> also at these lines: 4884, 4901, 4976, 5094, 7030, 7083, 7125, 7163, 7204, 7245, 7283, 7321, 7359, 7396, 7436, 7477, 7518, 7556, 7592, 7625, 8233, 8239, 8245, 8251, 8257, 8298, 8305, 8608, 8614, 8620, 8626, 8632, 8813
2019-05-14T14:33:09  <cindyli> so what i'm coding is, in the new computeDemandedSettingsPaths() function we talked yesterday, the check for valid settings paths is to make sure they start with "http://registry.gpii.net/" to extract both common terms and application specific terms
2019-05-14T14:33:25  <cindyli> please let me know if you don't agree
2019-05-14T14:33:56  <Bosmon> Thanks cindyli for this brilliant research
2019-05-14T14:34:18  <cindyli> well, it's a fairly boring research ;)
2019-05-14T14:34:26  <Bosmon> cindyli - most brilliant research is : P
2019-05-14T14:36:43  <Bosmon> cindyli - well, this is a surprise to me, but I guess shows that we were mistaken about how the system actually works
2019-05-14T14:38:23  <Bosmon> I have a wonder about whether the-t-in-rtf 's SR validation pull has done anything about this
2019-05-14T14:39:28  <Bosmon> Ah, I see that there actually has been a schema written for this "phantom setting" - http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/applications/com\\.microsoft\\.windows\\.desktopBackground.Scaling
2019-05-14T14:40:02  <cindyli> Bosmon: from the other side, it's great to know the system supports both cases. the JJ's use case: line 83 at https://pad.gpii.net/p/transformer-matching-algorithm-ie1e4nmf is actually application specific for microsoft word
2019-05-14T14:40:44  <Bosmon> I'm actually now struggling to determine what this SR entry actually means
2019-05-14T14:41:31  <Bosmon> Because I see that "TileWallpaper" is actually a primary supportedSetting, but one which is not actually used in the definition of the "capabilitiesTransformations" for TileWallpaper
2019-05-14T14:43:08  <Bosmon> I'm guessing that the effect of this is that the TileWallpaper setting ends up being used if it is set directly, but that this will be overwritten by any value which can be derived from "Scaling"
2019-05-14T14:43:12  <cindyli> what do you mean by "not actually used in the definition of the "capabilitiesTransformations" for TileWallpaper"? there's a match of "TileWallpaper" in "supportedSettings" and "capabilitiesTransformations" blocks
2019-05-14T14:43:50  <cindyli> there's no "scaling" definition in the "capabilitiesTransformations" block
2019-05-14T14:44:07  <Bosmon> cindyli - right
2019-05-14T14:44:37  <Bosmon> I'm meaning that the value of "TileWallpaper" is not consumed in its own capabilitiesTransformations block
2019-05-14T14:45:43  <cindyli> i see
2019-05-14T14:52:21  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon and @cindyli, the settings validation does require a URI
2019-05-14T14:53:06  <the-t-in-rtf> there are also checks to see if "common" settings entries exist at all in flat.json5
2019-05-14T14:53:20  <the-t-in-rtf> (in test data)
2019-05-14T14:53:32  <the-t-in-rtf> I just realised that I don't yet check for phantom transforms
2019-05-14T14:53:43  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. transforms for "common" settings that no longer exist in flat.json5
2019-05-14T14:54:01  <the-t-in-rtf> I will add that to my list, as I caught a phantom setting in my earlier work today
2019-05-14T14:54:22  <the-t-in-rtf> I think the settings keys even require the registry.gpii.net prefix
2019-05-14T14:54:27  <the-t-in-rtf> now that I think about it.
2019-05-14T14:56:08  <Bosmon> It's unclear what the "use meaning" of this SR entry really is, but of course we never actually discover that until it gets consumed by the QS somehow

2019-05-14T15:05:34  <javjarfer[m]> I completely agree
2019-05-14T15:06:30  <Bosmon> But actually to me it is unclear what is meant to happen when we schematise and support both a primary setting and then a further one which is transforms into its space from another
2019-05-14T15:07:03  <Bosmon> It's possible the real purpose here is to document both the input and the output space of the transform
2019-05-14T15:07:06  <Bosmon> Which is all very worthy
2019-05-14T15:07:22  <Bosmon> But we lack what a formalist might call an "operational semantics" for the actual system : P
2019-05-14T15:25:45  <javjarfer[m]> > But we lack what a formalist might call an "operational semantics" for the actual system : P
2019-05-14T15:25:46  <javjarfer[m]> I'm afraid we will need more time to develop one... if we could stop with other features, we could focus into something like this
2019-05-14T15:28:58  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - sure
2019-05-14T15:29:06  <Bosmon> In the meantime we will have to say that "the system does what it does" : P
2019-05-14T15:29:30  <Bosmon> Eventually we will have to make some decision about whether settings such as "TileWallpaper" are intended to be consumed directly

I think that we would need at the end some kind of simplification on our side for that type of settings, if we want to map all the settings a vendor expose, we need to be able to express the interaction between those settings, for hiding them to the end user
2019-05-14T15:43:48  <javjarfer[m]> problem is that first, we want to map "all the vendor settings" and secondly, we want to be able to (express the same interaction / create simplifications) over those exposed settings, most of the time we just need to be able to express the same simplifications they do over certain settings

2019-05-14T17:15:08  <bryan_> Bosmon: I'm trying to run the platform/windows acceptance tests in gpii/universal from inside gpii/windows. The dev release of universal in package.json in windows works, but the latest universal master errors out. I based my branch on the latest from master since that is where I will PR. There are quite a few changes merged into master so I'm not sure where things broke. Any suggestions on where to start?

2019-05-14T17:17:21  <Bosmon> The latest dev release of universal is 0.3.0-dev.20190513T153234Z.f0de96f0 which is derived from its current master
2019-05-14T17:17:30  <Bosmon> And which is the one referenced in the current master of windows package.json
2019-05-14T17:17:50  <Bosmon> Did you update again within the last hour, since I just pushed a few more merges which restored consistency?
