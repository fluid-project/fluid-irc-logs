2019-11-05T14:57:36  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: is there a way i can test MS office "word-ribbon" in my gpii-app windows VM? is there an evaluation version of MS office to install in VM?

2019-11-05T16:10:08  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding the new PSPChannel read API, I'm tracking all applied and read preferences in the model path "lifecycleManager.userSession.model.currentPreferences". pspChannel now iterates thru this model value to generated the output value of "settingContorls" to gpii-app. one use case is, when a setting value stays unchanged in between the first read and the second read, "settingsControls" block will be unchanged too -> there wo
2019-11-05T16:10:08  <cindyli> n't be an pspChannel model change -> pspChannel won't send a message back to pspChannel client (gpii-app).
2019-11-05T16:11:00  <cindyli> so i introduce a new model path "lifecycleManager.userSession.model.readPreferenceCount". its value will be incremented by 1 every time with a read request
2019-11-05T16:12:43  <cindyli> this is to ensure a pspChannel model change to be triggered and a message and "settingControls" block will always be sent back to gpii-app for a read request
2019-11-05T16:13:00  <cindyli> Bosmon: do you think this approach makes sense?
2019-11-05T16:13:20  <Bosmon> cindyli - I don't think so, no
2019-11-05T16:13:28  <Bosmon> If the setting value stays unchanged, there should not be a further message
2019-11-05T16:16:02  <cindyli> so if the setting value stays unchanged, shall i return a "readSuccess" message?
2019-11-05T16:16:19  <cindyli> if there's a setting change, there would be 2 messages being returned
2019-11-05T16:16:33  <cindyli> first is "modelChanged" with settingControls block
2019-11-05T16:16:40  <cindyli> the 2nd is "readSucess"
2019-11-05T16:17:58  <cindyli> does it make sense?
2019-11-05T16:18:00  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, the readSuccess message would be a helpful courtesy although it is not essential for this current use
2019-11-05T16:18:21  <Bosmon> I imagine the current client would ignore it
2019-11-05T16:19:07  <cindyli> ok
2019-11-05T16:21:07  <cindyli> Bosmon: I tested the read API with all 6 Morphic supported settings. 3 of them can be read successfully. but the other 3 cannot be read at all: MS office word-ribbon, selfVoicing and high contrast theme
2019-11-05T16:21:48  <Bosmon> cindyli - that's interesting
2019-11-05T16:21:50  <cindyli> so, for settings that cannot be read, right now i return a "readFail" message, does it make sense to you?
2019-11-05T16:21:56  <Bosmon> Why can high contrast theme not be read?
2019-11-05T16:22:00  <cindyli> i looked into
2019-11-05T16:22:04  <cindyli> all 3
2019-11-05T16:22:30  <cindyli> hight contrast has no "inverseCapabilitiesTransformations" block defined in win32.json5
2019-11-05T16:23:12  <cindyli> word-ribbon's settings handler doesn't have get() implemented - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/RemoteFileSettingsHandler.js#L435-L437
2019-11-05T16:24:16  <cindyli> selfVoicing is a one way route too, that UIO+ only applies settings but doesn't read any settings
2019-11-05T16:25:16  <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, we should file JIRAs for all of these
2019-11-05T16:25:23  <Bosmon> Although selfVoicing is really our own problem
2019-11-05T16:25:36  <cindyli> sure, i will do it. is it ok to return a "readFail" message when the setting value cannot be read?
2019-11-05T16:25:39  <Bosmon> We will actually have any current setting values in our own model
2019-11-05T16:25:52  <Bosmon> cindyli - again it is a helpful courtesy although I imagine that the client will ignore it
2019-11-05T16:26:01  <cindyli> ok
2019-11-05T16:26:03  <Bosmon> There is nothing sensible it could do with such a message at present
2019-11-05T16:26:16  <cindyli> ya, understand :)
