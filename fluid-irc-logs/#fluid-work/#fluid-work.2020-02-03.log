2020-02-03T14:55:32  <cindyli> Bosmon2: regarding https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4329, point ii), you said "The solutions registry files, e.g. win32.json5, will have to be accompanied by a metadata.json5 file", do you mean all SR files will be accompanied by a common metadata.json5 or each SR has its own metadata.json5?
2020-02-03T14:55:39  <cindyli> the latter might be more flexible

2020-02-03T14:59:19  <javjarfer[m]> hi cindyli ! I'm back! I have answered your comment here https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/4a68b6f18f6f9a540d9ee4a554e9ed79ce9dd8c8#commitcomment-37092228
2020-02-03T14:59:38  <cindyli> saw it. thanks, javjarfer[m]

2020-02-03T15:00:54  <javjarfer[m]> yw! You told me that I could perform this transforms if I include the settings in the capabilities block of the solution true?
2020-02-03T15:01:04  <javjarfer[m]> (I don't recall if that were you exact words)

2020-02-03T15:03:47  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: the capabilitiesTransformations block is for transforming common terms into corresponding application terms. in your case when using application terms directly, you don't need to define settings in the capabilitiesTransformations block but should define settings in the prefs set directly
2020-02-03T15:04:41  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I see, so, there isn't a simple way for making this transform work?
2020-02-03T15:06:02  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: it does work. can you describe your use case so I understand why you expect it work for application terms

2020-02-03T15:07:51  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: sure, my use case (we have used this in another AT too previously) is to default some settings to a known value always, when this settings doesn't have sense for us to have other value, **or** like in this case in which, in order for being able to gracefully close the AT, we need to set a particular setting that let's us close it using a simple "Window message"
2020-02-03T15:09:41  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: what's the other AT and its settings that works before?
2020-02-03T15:10:13  <cindyli> i also need to learn what's the standard way to handle this kind of cases

2020-02-03T15:21:04  <cindyli> javjarfer[m]: the easiest way to get the "capabilitiesTransformations" block executed even for application terms is to include the app term, in your case would be "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/applications/com\\.aisquared\\.zoomtext" into the "capabilities" block, line 6185 of win32.json5 in your branch - https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-830/testData/solutions/win32.json5
2020-02-03T15:22:06  <cindyli> but i don't know if this is the right way to handle your use case because we've never had application terms defined in the "capabilities" block
2020-02-03T15:24:19  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: I was used for ZoomText (in the previous demos), it's used for JAWS in the new pull request for the same reason as ZoomText, previously, when we didn't supported different voice profiles for JAWS, was used to enforce a particular voice profile, I think it was used to set a setting to the "Morphic Theme" prior to highcontrast, I think it's used also for the OSK for the same reason as for the previous
2020-02-03T15:24:19  <javjarfer[m]> described ATs too
2020-02-03T15:25:04  <javjarfer[m]> cindyli: that's a simple solution
2020-02-03T15:25:50  <javjarfer[m]> will try it thanks, I think I will need to update and revisit all the other places if this is required, because probably those places wont be working right now
2020-02-03T15:26:34  <cindyli> great idea, javjarfer[m]
