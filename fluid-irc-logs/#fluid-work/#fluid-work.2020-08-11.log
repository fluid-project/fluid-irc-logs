2020-08-11T17:00:02  <colinclark> I’m wondering if your attempts at contributing to our projects related to a class you’re currently taking at school?

2020-08-11T17:10:30  <colinclark> I’ve seen this PR, but I’d like you to answer my question first please
2020-08-11T17:10:44  <raunak> sure
2020-08-11T17:10:45  <colinclark> then we can talk about your PR and my concerns about the way you’ve been making your contrbutions
2020-08-11T17:11:17  <colinclark> But first I want to understand your motivations here
2020-08-11T17:11:48  <raunak> because the code based of this easy to understand to me
2020-08-11T17:11:57  <raunak> and similar to my stack
2020-08-11T17:12:07  <colinclark> Is this part of a school assignment?
2020-08-11T17:12:14  <raunak> no
2020-08-11T17:12:27  <colinclark> Is it because you’re interested in participating in Google Summer of Code?
2020-08-11T17:12:36  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:12:42  <colinclark> next year?
2020-08-11T17:12:45  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:13:02  <colinclark> And so what’s the motivation behind your actions…
2020-08-11T17:13:12  <colinclark> are you looking to get more credit for having made contributions to open source?
2020-08-11T17:13:22  <colinclark> are you wanting to improve your Github profile?

2020-08-11T17:15:10  *** jhung_3 is now known as jhung
2020-08-11T17:15:14  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:15:38  <raunak> are you there ??
2020-08-11T17:16:04  <colinclark> I’m here, yes
2020-08-11T17:16:17  <colinclark> I’m not sure if you answered my question or not
2020-08-11T17:16:47  <raunak> plz tell your question...
2020-08-11T17:17:11  <colinclark> So what is your actual goal here with these contributions?
2020-08-11T17:17:40  <raunak> to  improve the website and fixed the  issues which is opened
2020-08-11T17:17:50  <colinclark> No, I’m asking what your personal goal is
2020-08-11T17:18:03  <colinclark> You want to increase the number of contrbutions on your Github profile so that it reflects positively on your application for next year’s Google Summer of Code program?
2020-08-11T17:18:21  <raunak> to become a contributer of this project my goal is
2020-08-11T17:18:23  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:18:40  <colinclark> Of our project, in particular?
2020-08-11T17:19:02  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:19:05  <colinclark> Ok
2020-08-11T17:19:13  <colinclark> So, I need to be completely clear with you...
2020-08-11T17:19:23  <raunak> ?
2020-08-11T17:19:25  <colinclark> your contributions aren’t very positive at the moment
2020-08-11T17:19:36  <colinclark> and it’s becoming frustrating for many of the other contributors
2020-08-11T17:19:49  <colinclark> Two out of the three pull requests you submiitted were closed for good reasons…
2020-08-11T17:19:59  <raunak> you can check my this pr https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/177
2020-08-11T17:20:05  <colinclark> raunak: Please listen to me
2020-08-11T17:20:08  <raunak> i fixed a new isssue
2020-08-11T17:20:12  <colinclark> we’ll talk about that issue in a moment
2020-08-11T17:20:32  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:21:46  <raunak> i also provide the ideas to fixed an issue https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/jkMyWY8K/good%201.PNG
2020-08-11T17:21:52  <colinclark> So the two pull requests you filed to the We Count website are closed
2020-08-11T17:21:58  <colinclark> one of them wasn’t helpful
2020-08-11T17:22:22  <colinclark> the other had to be fixed in the content, not the site itself
2020-08-11T17:22:29  <raunak> because the html file is not available in code based that html file is coming from wordpress
2020-08-11T17:22:46  <colinclark> Correct
2020-08-11T17:22:49  <raunak> i give a idea to mentor how we fixed that

2020-08-11T17:24:49  <colinclark> those two pull requests are closed
2020-08-11T17:25:05  <colinclark> So unless you have any questions about them, they don’t need to be discussed further, is that correct raunak?
2020-08-11T17:25:18  <raunak> yes is there html file is available in wecount then pr easily gets  merged
2020-08-11T17:25:40  <colinclark> but the pull request didn’t get merged
2020-08-11T17:25:42  <colinclark> and it’s closed
2020-08-11T17:26:00  <colinclark> So is there anything else to discuss about it or the other We Count pull request?
2020-08-11T17:26:08  <raunak> yes

2020-08-11T17:28:11  <colinclark> raunak: I don’t feel like you’re listening to me
2020-08-11T17:28:24  <raunak> yes i listening to you
2020-08-11T17:28:55  <colinclark> Could you answer this question: Is there anything else you would like to discuss specifically about the two We Count pull requests you filed?
2020-08-11T17:29:21  <raunak> ya new issue in floe project
2020-08-11T17:29:25  <colinclark> We’re not talking about the Floe Project pull request yet
2020-08-11T17:29:30  <colinclark> we’re talking about the We Count pull requests
2020-08-11T17:29:31  <raunak> ok
2020-08-11T17:30:19  <raunak> no
2020-08-11T17:30:24  <colinclark> So they’re closed, you understand why they’re closed, and we can move on?
2020-08-11T17:30:32  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:30:36  <colinclark> Great
2020-08-11T17:30:54  <raunak> can we discuss the pr for floe project now???
2020-08-11T17:30:59  <colinclark> Now, you’ve filed an issue to the Floe Project website
2020-08-11T17:31:01  <colinclark> yes, we can talk about it
2020-08-11T17:31:24  <colinclark> As you can see, I left comments on PR #177
2020-08-11T17:31:39  <colinclark> First of all, I stated that we’re in the midst of changing the design of the Floe Project website
2020-08-11T17:31:42  <raunak> yeah when we do the text size to less than  1  it collpaesd
2020-08-11T17:31:48  <colinclark> let’s talk about the comments
2020-08-11T17:32:05  <colinclark> Do you understand that someone else is currently working on redesigning the website?
2020-08-11T17:32:20  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:32:46  <colinclark> So in my comment, I mentioned that right now, making changes to the styling of the older version of the website isn’t very helpful
2020-08-11T17:32:54  <colinclark> Do you understand why?
2020-08-11T17:33:09  <raunak> ok but i found an issue then i mentioned there
2020-08-11T17:33:20  <colinclark> raunak: Can you answer my question?
2020-08-11T17:33:42  <colinclark> You keep saying “Ok but…” whenever I’m trying to explain something to you
2020-08-11T17:33:45  <raunak> yes  i understand
2020-08-11T17:33:50  <colinclark> I feel as if you’re not listenining to me
2020-08-11T17:34:06  <raunak> yes i understand all .....
2020-08-11T17:34:11  <raunak> thanks
2020-08-11T17:35:00  <colinclark> So earlier, you said your goal was to help our project
2020-08-11T17:35:20  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:35:31  <colinclark> And I’ve explained, both on the pull request and here in the IRC project, that this fix isn’t helpful right now
2020-08-11T17:35:41  <raunak> but can you answer my question ??
2020-08-11T17:35:42  <colinclark> yet you keep saying “Ok but…”
2020-08-11T17:36:16  <colinclark> On the pull request, I also offered some suggestions for how to think about creating helpful and explanatory commit messages
2020-08-11T17:36:39  <colinclark> but really, more importantly, what I’m saying is that your pull request isn’t helpful right now
2020-08-11T17:36:47  <raunak> the pr which i made for floe is effective   yes or no ??? plz reply
2020-08-11T17:37:07  <colinclark> In it’s current form, I don’t believe I can say whether or not it is effectiive
2020-08-11T17:37:14  <colinclark> I can’t reproduce the issue on my own devices
2020-08-11T17:37:30  <colinclark> and I haven’t seen any clear indication that you’ve tested sufficiently to verify if it is an acceptable fix
2020-08-11T17:37:30  <raunak> on tommorrow you say i see this bug
2020-08-11T17:37:52  <colinclark> More importantly, as I’ve said repeatedly, this isn’t a priority for us right now
2020-08-11T17:37:58  <colinclark> the styling will change very soon
2020-08-11T17:38:05  <colinclark> we’re focused on the new design right now
2020-08-11T17:38:14  <colinclark> We have limited capacity right now
2020-08-11T17:38:31  <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: fyi, https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/fluid-express-user/pull/9
2020-08-11T17:38:39  <colinclark> and we are focusing on important contributions to our projects
2020-08-11T17:38:51  <colinclark> and on mentoring our current GSoC students
2020-08-11T17:39:04  <colinclark> this takes time, energy, and effort
2020-08-11T17:39:38  <colinclark> And the way you’re interacting wth our community isn’t acceptable
2020-08-11T17:39:58  <colinclark> you’re demanding responses from people who are busy and care a lot about their projects
2020-08-11T17:40:24  <colinclark> If you want to be an effective contributor to an open source community, you’re going to have to work first on communication skills
2020-08-11T17:40:35  <colinclark> You might remember that this was feedback I gave you a week or two ago
2020-08-11T17:40:50  <raunak> really sorry about this
2020-08-11T17:40:58  <colinclark> That’s okay
2020-08-11T17:41:07  <colinclark> it takes time to learn how to do open source effectively
2020-08-11T17:41:10  <raunak> one day i will merged my pr thanks
2020-08-11T17:41:29  <colinclark> Please seriously consider the approach you’re taking to trying to contribute
2020-08-11T17:41:41  <colinclark> ti’s not all about you, or getting credit, or improvng your Github profile
2020-08-11T17:41:54  <colinclark> In open source, you’re part of something bigger
2020-08-11T17:42:12  <colinclark> that starts with doing the background reading and research to learn more about a community’s goals and priorities
2020-08-11T17:42:30  <colinclark> to ask first if working on an issue is helpful or not
2020-08-11T17:42:44  <colinclark> to get to know what other people are working on so they don’t get tripped up by your efforts
2020-08-11T17:42:55  <colinclark> and to respect people’s time and energy
2020-08-11T17:43:13  <colinclark> Is what I’m saying clear to you, raunak?
2020-08-11T17:43:20  <colinclark> And do you have any questions I can help answer?
2020-08-11T17:43:35  <raunak> thanks for guidiing me from now i remember
2020-08-11T17:43:40  <raunak> all your points
2020-08-11T17:44:01  <colinclark> So I’d lke to you to consider not submtting pull requests to our projects
2020-08-11T17:44:09  <colinclark> until you’re sure that it’s a helpful contributioino
2020-08-11T17:44:14  <colinclark> contribution
2020-08-11T17:44:23  <colinclark> and until you’re clear on the context and priorities for the project
2020-08-11T17:44:23  <raunak> yes
2020-08-11T17:44:32  <colinclark> Thank you, I appreciate that
2020-08-11T17:45:19  <colinclark> I do strongly recommend reading the GSoC guidelnies that I shared with you last time
2020-08-11T17:45:40  <raunak> first i ask the mentors regarding the issue and how we fixed that then we think about the pr
2020-08-11T17:45:49  <colinclark> Just to be completely clear
2020-08-11T17:46:01  <colinclark> We’re not formally your mentors
2020-08-11T17:46:04  <colinclark> We’re just contributors
2020-08-11T17:46:07  <colinclark> and you’re just a contributor
2020-08-11T17:46:22  <colinclark> We are mentors for two specific GSoC projects
2020-08-11T17:46:27  <colinclark> mentors to those students who were selected
2020-08-11T17:47:07  <colinclark> I understand that you some day would like to be selected as a student
2020-08-11T17:47:44  <colinclark> one of the most important criteria we look for in prospective students is their ability to communicate clearly, do their own research, and to work in a collaborative yet self-sufficient way
2020-08-11T17:48:05  <colinclark> That’s not something I’ve seen in your work so far
2020-08-11T17:48:20  <raunak> from now plz give me one chance to prove myself
2020-08-11T17:48:44  <colinclark> raunak: It’s not about proving yourself
2020-08-11T17:48:50  <colinclark> this isn’t a game where you have to get a high score
2020-08-11T17:49:18  <raunak> i remember all your points
2020-08-11T17:50:06  <raunak> how to commuinncate with others first ask the mentors  regarding anything in their free time
2020-08-11T17:50:21  <raunak> do not distrub the mentors again and again
2020-08-11T17:50:37  <raunak> thanks from now i will update myself
2020-08-11T17:50:52  <colinclark> Thanks, I appreciate it, raunak
2020-08-11T17:51:17  <raunak> and thansk for giving your time
2020-08-11T17:51:39  <colinclark> Thanks for listening!
2020-08-11T18:13:00  <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for the pull, @gtirloni
2020-08-11T18:13:23  <the-t-in-rtf> I look forward to reviewing it when I'm back in the office (or maybe before, so exciting)
2020-08-11T18:24:03  <gtirloni> :)
2020-08-11T18:33:29  <dmahajan980> jhung: I forgot to ask this during the design crit, but do you need the slides for record?
2020-08-11T18:34:02  <jhung> dmahajan980 if you can send them to me, that would be great. I'll just add it to the links on the wiki.

2020-08-11T18:59:14  <gmoss> colinclark: there's a video recording (and it's as great as you heard) :) https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops+and+design+crits
2020-08-11T18:59:26  <colinclark> awesome!
2020-08-11T18:59:32  <dmahajan980> colinclark: The timings were a bit odd so that's fine.
2020-08-11T19:00:41  <dmahajan980> But it'd be great if you can try it out and give some feedback. The other members have also left with so much and amazing feedback.
2020-08-11T19:01:01  <dmahajan980> Some of them we see as stepping stones in the project.
2020-08-11T19:02:35  <dmahajan980> gmoss: Thanks for sharing the link :)

2020-08-11T19:24:01  <sbates> dmahajan980: thanks very much for your presentation, it's an awesome project, well done!
2020-08-11T19:25:38  <dmahajan980> sbates: Thank you very much for the compliment! Most of the stuff wouldn't have been possible without the-t-in-rtf
2020-08-11T20:15:45  <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf is great, I agree! :)
