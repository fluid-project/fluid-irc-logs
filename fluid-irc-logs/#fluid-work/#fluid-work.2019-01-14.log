2019-01-14T12:04:44  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was thinking a bit about the removing of the starter grades. I wonder if instead of removing it right now. We just depreciate it, and maybe don't worry about feature parity with the schema version. And then fully remove it at a later date when there is more time. What do you think?

2019-01-14T13:52:39  <the-t-in-rtf> it was meant to be about the former
2019-01-14T13:52:46  <the-t-in-rtf> but I suspect we might want to switch it up
2019-01-14T13:52:51  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, any thoughts?

2019-01-14T15:47:25  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hello.. I have another tester question for you. I have a new test that I'm writing and it appears that a large block from one of the functions is never executed. I've manually stepped through it during the test and most of that block is in fact run during the tests. This reminds me of something we came across before but I don't remember how we addressed it.
2019-01-14T15:47:34  <Justin_o> I wonder if you might recall
2019-01-14T15:49:04  <the-t-in-rtf> if you can step through to the code, then the problem is that it's not instrumented
2019-01-14T15:49:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if it were instrumented you'd be staring at really dense and inscrutable gibberish rather than a sane line of code
2019-01-14T15:50:15  <the-t-in-rtf> or I guess you're saying that if you run it in another way?
2019-01-14T15:50:39  <the-t-in-rtf> if you're running it in a debugger via the same means that the coverage run runs, then my point stands
2019-01-14T15:51:21  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: i'm running the test directly. but i'd assume the file is instrumented because some portions of the code appear to be tested.
2019-01-14T15:51:35  <Justin_o> ah, but maybe they are coming from a different test?
2019-01-14T15:52:06  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that could be
2019-01-14T15:52:19  <the-t-in-rtf> and you'll have to define what you mean by running the test directly
2019-01-14T15:52:27  <the-t-in-rtf> you mean, like python -m SimpleHTTPServer?
2019-01-14T15:52:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, are these browser tests or node?
2019-01-14T15:52:41  <Justin_o> running the test directly i just mean serving it with my own web server and hitting that in the browser
2019-01-14T15:52:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I assume the former.
2019-01-14T15:52:46  <the-t-in-rtf> got it.
2019-01-14T15:52:47  <Justin_o> yes, browser
2019-01-14T15:53:19  <the-t-in-rtf> what project?
2019-01-14T15:53:34  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, does it have  node  tests as well?
2019-01-14T15:53:52  <the-t-in-rtf> There are other fun issues if (for example) nyc is working in one dir and testem in another
2019-01-14T15:53:59  <the-t-in-rtf> THAT is exactly the issue we discussed earlier
2019-01-14T15:54:10  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you have to rename the temporary directory variable in your .nycrc
2019-01-14T15:56:07  <Justin_o> ah, right..
2019-01-14T15:56:29  <Justin_o> well this is for Infusion, so there are both node and browser tests... although i would have imagined it was already sorted out to be setup correctly
2019-01-14T15:57:04  <Justin_o> The test in question for me does appear to be in the all-tests correctly. I just ran that again locally to double check.
2019-01-14T15:57:18  <Justin_o> If you're interested, it's in my FLUID-6303 branch
2019-01-14T15:57:47  <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/infusion/tree/FLUID-6303
2019-01-14T15:57:54  <Justin_o> actually, i haven't pushed up my latest code yet
2019-01-14T16:00:38  <Justin_o> okay, i pushed things up now
2019-01-14T16:01:40  <Justin_o> I may have found the problem.
2019-01-14T16:01:48  <the-t-in-rtf> yup,
2019-01-14T16:01:50  <the-t-in-rtf> temp-dir
2019-01-14T16:01:53  <the-t-in-rtf> it should be temp-dir
2019-01-14T16:03:05  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: you mean this one https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/package.json#L31
2019-01-14T16:03:34  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: it's also set to "coverage" in nyc https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/.nycrc#L14
2019-01-14T16:03:59  <jhernandez> Bosmon: great, thanks for merging the TRAY!!
2019-01-14T16:04:21  <the-t-in-rtf> no, it's not, man
2019-01-14T16:04:22  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: so the issue i found is that I think i missed a the testem.js include in the test file.. i only had coverageSender.js
2019-01-14T16:04:26  <the-t-in-rtf> the key changed
2019-01-14T16:04:29  <the-t-in-rtf> it's now temp-dir
2019-01-14T16:04:49  <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe their docs just stink
2019-01-14T16:04:59  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc
2019-01-14T16:05:04  <the-t-in-rtf> it definitely changed from one to the other
2019-01-14T16:05:10  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: oh.. i see.. not the value.. so "temp-directory" needs to be changed to "temp-dir" in both the package.json and the .nycrc file?
2019-01-14T16:05:26  <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, and you should only have a belt or suspenders

2019-01-14T16:06:01  <the-t-in-rtf> It seems really dangerous to have an nyc block in package.json and a settings file.
2019-01-14T16:06:19  <the-t-in-rtf> I wouldn't have even though to look in package.json once I saw the .nycrc file
2019-01-14T16:06:33  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: so it looks like "temp-directory" was deprecated but is left as an alias to "temp-dir" https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/commit/ccf42dffaf93bbc97cd98577f0a2b7724bb8d4c9
2019-01-14T16:06:45  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe they've done that recently
2019-01-14T16:06:59  <the-t-in-rtf> you can know for sure if it's an issue, just look to see if .nyc_output is created
2019-01-14T16:07:06  <the-t-in-rtf> after the node run, I mean
2019-01-14T16:07:12  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yah not sure why it's in both places, maybe something missed being updated.. I'll try removing it from the package.json and changing it to temp-dir
2019-01-14T16:07:27  <the-t-in-rtf> it's also cleaned in the package.json, which it shouldn't be

2019-01-14T16:17:50  <Justin_o> and if so, should the reports not be cleaned either? can we remove rimraf completely?

2019-01-14T16:54:57  <Justin_o> the specific issue i initially had was fixed by adding the missing testem.js include in the test file.

2019-01-14T17:23:04  <colinclark> I think sgithens looked at it years ago, briefly
2019-01-14T17:39:35  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: Any thoughts on what might be causing testem to fail on CI. https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-browser-tests/143/console
2019-01-14T17:40:23  <Justin_o> It's running on my machine when i call `npm run test:vagrantBrowser` and the output seems to be the same up the point where it fails.

2019-01-14T17:45:20  <the-t-in-rtf> what version of testem are you using?
2019-01-14T17:45:28  <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-testem is only compatible with a couple of versions back
2019-01-14T17:45:43  <the-t-in-rtf> that error looks very much like you're using a newer version of testem than gpii-testem supports....
2019-01-14T17:46:19  <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3457
2019-01-14T17:47:22  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ah okay.. i had updated it to "2.14.0"
2019-01-14T17:47:29  <Justin_o> so i should roll back to 2.13.0
2019-01-14T17:47:44  <the-t-in-rtf> no
2019-01-14T17:47:46  <the-t-in-rtf> sadly, 2.12.0
2019-01-14T17:47:47  <Justin_o> sorry, i guess something before that
2019-01-14T17:47:54  <the-t-in-rtf> it's on my list (and in the issue!)
2019-01-14T17:47:58  <Justin_o> okay, thanks.. at least the fix will be easy :)
2019-01-14T17:48:26  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, like the old joke
2019-01-14T17:48:34  <the-t-in-rtf> doctor, it hurts when I do *this*
2019-01-14T17:48:37  <Justin_o> i wonder why it was working in my vagrant vm though
2019-01-14T17:48:38  <the-t-in-rtf> don't do that then
2019-01-14T17:48:56  <the-t-in-rtf> that's a good question, but it inherits your node_modules directory
2019-01-14T17:49:01  <the-t-in-rtf> maybe you hadn't cleaned that out
2019-01-14T17:49:03  <Justin_o> haha.. yah.. i think my old doctor actually told me that before, but not as a joke.  or maybe it was my old dentist
2019-01-14T17:49:09  <the-t-in-rtf> (after updating the dependency)
2019-01-14T17:49:34  <Justin_o> i didn't delete the node_modules dir, but who knows.. sometimes npm does strange things
2019-01-14T17:53:23  <the-t-in-rtf> the bug may also be unique to particular platforms
2019-01-14T17:53:30  <the-t-in-rtf> well, the mismatch between versions

2019-01-14T20:02:20  <colinclark> Hey Justin_o, I just wanted to thank you for making fluid-publish :)
2019-01-14T20:02:30  <colinclark> I use it a lot and it's hugely helpful when developing across multiple libraries
2019-01-14T20:11:08  <Bosmon> It's a super-brilliant tool
2019-01-14T20:11:28  <Bosmon> I can't wait for it to be souped up for the... **MONNO-REPPO**.... WORLDD!
2019-01-14T20:17:27  <colinclark> yeah, that'll be awesome

2019-01-14T20:36:38  <bryan_> I rebased on the latest from master and something broke...the unit tests work fine by themselves but running npm test crashes.  Not sure why

2019-01-14T20:44:48  <bryan_> Bosmon: this is weird...the tests are suddenly working and I didn't change anything. PR on the way before it changes its mind
2019-01-14T20:45:21  <Bosmon> bryan_ - ok cool - npm test for gpii-windows crashed?
2019-01-14T20:46:29  <bryan_> Npm test was returning failed to exec test: unit script
2019-01-14T20:46:48  <bryan_> But npm run test:unit worked fine
2019-01-14T20:47:28  <bryan_> But then npm test worked fine a few minutes later

2019-01-14T20:51:00  <bryan_> But it is working consistently now. Ghost in the machine?

2019-01-14T21:10:28  <sgithens> colinclark: I did look at it a while back, but should take another gander. I don’t think I ended up basing anything off it. What I’m really interested in is looking at your infusion code mirror stuff again
2019-01-14T21:11:13  <sgithens> I’d like to have a power feature in the ppt to edit the raw prefsset for testing
2019-01-14T21:14:51  <colinclark> oh yes
2019-01-14T21:15:13  <colinclark> it hasn't been updated in a while, sgithens, but it seems to have the basic functionality
2019-01-14T21:15:19  <colinclark> probably it could use some tests
2019-01-14T21:17:15  <sgithens> Awesome
2019-01-14T21:17:52  <sgithens> colinclark: great to hear your residency hacking updates
2019-01-14T21:18:11  <colinclark> it's pretty slow going :)
2019-01-14T21:18:19  <colinclark> three days in and I don't yet have anything that can play some videos
2019-01-14T21:18:36  <colinclark> but I do have some passing tests now, which is probably a better foundation ot build on
2019-01-14T21:19:15  <sgithens> I feel confident you’ll get some stuff playing before the next time you go to bed!

2019-01-14T22:45:06  <sgithens> Bosmon:  For the current cloud based flowmanager in production on AWS/GCP... do requests send in their credentials on essentially every transaction? I'm just wondering if our session support on there has any type of backend yet for persistence and what it's using? For the PPT, I've been using the redis backend locally for the express-sessions which works well.  But need to set it up on GCP now
