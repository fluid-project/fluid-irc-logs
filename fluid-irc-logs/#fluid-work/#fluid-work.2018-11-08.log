2018-11-08T15:54:17  <jhernandez> stegru: hola
2018-11-08T15:54:29  <stegru> yo
2018-11-08T15:54:34  <jhernandez> heh
2018-11-08T15:54:40  <jhernandez> I'm curious
2018-11-08T15:55:02  <stegru> about anything specific?
2018-11-08T15:55:13  <jhernandez> the problems we're having with the half applied high contrast themes
2018-11-08T15:55:28  <stegru> yes, I'm working on that now
2018-11-08T15:55:31  <jhernandez> I thought it was related to the explorer restart
2018-11-08T15:55:38  <jhernandez> but it's not
2018-11-08T15:55:46  <stegru> not quite.. remember the wallpaper issues we had in the first pilots?
2018-11-08T15:55:52  <jhernandez> yes
2018-11-08T15:56:24  <stegru> when turning high-contrast off, windows loads the theme that was last used.. rather than the actual settings
2018-11-08T15:56:41  <jhernandez> right
2018-11-08T15:56:49  <stegru> so, if you use the default theme, then set the wallpaper yourself, then the new wallpaper isn't part of that theme
2018-11-08T15:56:49  <jhernandez> oh
2018-11-08T15:56:55  <jhernandez> I see
2018-11-08T15:57:11  <jhernandez> stupid windows
2018-11-08T15:58:27  <jhernandez> and what is your approach to get this fixed?
2018-11-08T15:58:59  <jhernandez> do we have to track additional things and make them apply when restoring the high contrast theme?
2018-11-08T16:00:07  <stegru> yeh.. that's what I'm trying at first
2018-11-08T16:00:40  <stegru> but, there's other settings such as cursors that also work the same
2018-11-08T16:02:22  <stegru> i'm just looking at the wallpaper for now
2018-11-08T16:06:30  <jhernandez> heh
2018-11-08T16:06:32  <jhernandez> okay okay
2018-11-08T16:06:52  <jhernandez> as we said, this is not a showstopper
2018-11-08T16:07:08  <jhernandez> so take your time
2018-11-08T16:07:20  <jhernandez> I was just curious
2018-11-08T16:07:58  <jhernandez> I was asking because we may be rolling a new last minute installer
2018-11-08T16:09:07  <jhernandez> but I don't think is a good idea including this thing as it is not as trivial as a typo
2018-11-08T16:09:20  <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2018-11-08T16:11:06  <stegru> yeh, I can at least provide a work around for it: when setting a wallpaper, save the theme
2018-11-08T16:11:48  <stegru> it still doesn't help the language + high-contrast combination... but I doubt that's a popular thing
2018-11-08T16:18:53  <jhernandez> I wasn't asking for a workaround, just curious
2018-11-08T16:22:23  <jhernandez> stegru: you available for a quick skype?
2018-11-08T16:22:33  <stegru> yes
2018-11-08T16:22:33  <jhernandez> Kavya has problems with language
2018-11-08T16:22:43  <stegru> oh... no i'm not ;)
2018-11-08T16:27:52  <jhernandez> stegru: so windows doesn't allow you to change the language wither
2018-11-08T16:27:57  <jhernandez> either
