2018-10-05T08:55:38  <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I see that there is a new version of `gpii-universal`. Can you roll out a new version of `gpii-windows`, as well?
2018-10-05T08:56:24  <georgitodorov> Also, is stegru's test that was failing yesterday on my machine fixed in the new version of `gpii-universal`?
2018-10-05T08:57:14  <georgitodorov> And one last thing - any idea why I may be getting the "address in use" error when running both the PSP/QSS tests and the ones for `gpii-windows`?
2018-10-05T08:58:49  <stegru> georgitodorov: For your second question - no. https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/680
2018-10-05T09:01:49  <georgitodorov> stegru: I see, thanks.

2018-10-05T09:41:57  <georgitodorov> stegru: hmm, it is still not working for me. I receive again the ENOENT error. Is there anything else that I need to do?
2018-10-05T09:45:57  <georgitodorov> stegru: The file that the tests are trying to open is called "gpii-test-eventLog-0.246kvzxnwpf" but the actual file that gets created has the name "gpii-test-eventLog-0.t3vesws86zp"
2018-10-05T09:46:50  <georgitodorov> The same thing was happening when I tried running the tests with and without your initial fix - the names of the files differed
2018-10-05T09:46:57  <georgitodorov> Any ideas why this is happening?
2018-10-05T09:47:20  <stegru> oh I see - it looks like I was incorrect about the cause of the bug

2018-10-05T13:47:39  <Justin_o> I see there is a test for "*" to ensure that it matches a subcomponent. Are there tests for cases where you distribute options to a component that doesn't exist
2018-10-05T13:47:50  <Justin_o> e.g. {that > *} but there are no subcomponents
2018-10-05T13:48:15  <Bosmon> Justin_o - there can be no such tests
2018-10-05T13:48:24  <Bosmon> How could we test that a distribution doesn't arrive at a place that doesn't exist?
2018-10-05T13:48:41  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah.. that's like when i want to test that an event wasn't fired
2018-10-05T13:48:56  <Bosmon> You can test that an event isn't fired, by adding a listener to it : P
2018-10-05T13:49:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon: can we test that it doesn't break?
2018-10-05T13:49:06  <Bosmon> But you can't test that a distribution doesn't arrive at a nonexistent place
2018-10-05T13:49:10  <Justin_o> well i guess not because it will just wait
2018-10-05T13:49:29  <Justin_o> and the onCreate should still fire and etc..
2018-10-05T13:49:31  <Justin_o> okay.. never mind

2018-10-05T15:07:44  <cindyli> Bosmon: can you try to run JournalIntegration.js in this branch: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-3396
2018-10-05T15:08:23  <cindyli> i made a change to check noUserLoggedIn event before gpii.test.checkSequence
2018-10-05T15:09:31  <cindyli> i tested in mac and windows, both looks fine. but this doesn't count because I never successfully reproduce the hanging problem you had ;)
2018-10-05T15:20:04  <Bosmon> OK, thanks cindyli
2018-10-05T15:20:08  <Bosmon> Sounds like a simple way out of the problem
2018-10-05T15:20:35  <cindyli> let me know if it works

2018-10-05T15:31:17  <cindyli> Bosmon: i run into a problem at fixing https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3426. the solution i'm using is to fire a userError with "keyInFailed" when a user logon request fails for any reasons, in particular at userLogonRequest.onError event - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/UserLogonRequest.js#L44
2018-10-05T15:31:45  <cindyli> but i noticed there are other places during the keyin process that a userError could be reported - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L622-L629
2018-10-05T15:32:05  <cindyli> such as when a setting is failed to apply
2018-10-05T15:32:27  <Bosmon> cindyli - well, the setting fails to apply is its own notification
2018-10-05T15:32:51  <cindyli> my change makes the user error is triggered twice with WriteSettingFail and keyInFail
2018-10-05T15:33:02  <Bosmon> cindyli - that sounds correct to me
2018-10-05T15:33:03  <cindyli> is this right?
2018-10-05T15:33:06  <cindyli> ah ok
2018-10-05T15:33:23  <Bosmon> Astea already implemented a system for queueing notifications of multiple failures
2018-10-05T15:33:41  <cindyli> cool. thanks. fixing ErrorTests.js then
2018-10-05T15:34:01  <cindyli> at the moment it only expects one WriteSettingFail to be reported
