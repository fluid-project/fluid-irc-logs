2020-04-06T13:29:38  <the-t-in-rtf> No, I was waiting to confirm a couple of key things.
2020-04-06T13:30:09  <the-t-in-rtf> 1) I need to test a container image that includes the colour vision stuff
2020-04-06T13:30:22  <the-t-in-rtf> 2) Javi and I encountered a regression on the large mouse pointer settings stuff that I still need to investigate
2020-04-06T13:30:43  <the-t-in-rtf> I am just checking something with my work in progress on the LSR and switching over to investigate shortly

2020-04-06T14:35:07  <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon3 @jhernandez, etc. the large mouse pointer settings stuff is failing because the QSS is trying to use the cursorSize common term as a boolean
2020-04-06T14:35:11  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/172569e53c13fd1effb6edddd924e205e6da608d/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L189
2020-04-06T14:35:24  <the-t-in-rtf> when we say that it's meant to be a number.

2020-04-06T14:36:07  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: what I said in this jira report, right? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4384
2020-04-06T14:36:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I can update the common term to make it match the QSS, but it would mean we truly only have two levels, "large" and "not large"
2020-04-06T14:36:38  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I'm reopening the other ticket
2020-04-06T14:36:51  <the-t-in-rtf> it's linked from there
2020-04-06T14:37:46  <the-t-in-rtf> but I think maybe it's better to address it through the QSS instead
2020-04-06T14:38:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I will reopen and comment there
2020-04-06T14:38:27  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, it's all kinds of wrong to basically have this half-fakey "enabled" setting that doesn't use that namespace
2020-04-06T14:39:02  <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it should either be XXX/cursorSize: 2.0 or XXX/largeCursor/enabled
2020-04-06T14:39:09  <the-t-in-rtf> : true
2020-04-06T14:39:19  <the-t-in-rtf> at least it seems wrong to me
2020-04-06T14:39:25  *** Bosmon <Bosmon!~Bosmon3@148.252.29.206> has joined #fluid-work
2020-04-06T14:42:14  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I guess folks are concentrating, but it would good to huddle up and agree on direction.
2020-04-06T14:42:49  <the-t-in-rtf> Seems like we probably want to deploy the colour vision fixes from master.
2020-04-06T14:43:39  <the-t-in-rtf> I will set up my dev cloud to test that shortly unless I hear objections from @jhernandez, @Bosmon, etc
2020-04-06T14:44:25  <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps Javi can field this deployment?
2020-04-06T14:44:37  <the-t-in-rtf> he's already got the dev cloud set up.
2020-04-06T14:45:34  <jhernandez> mine is up
2020-04-06T14:45:52  <jhernandez> so dunno if you want to point people to it for testing
2020-04-06T14:46:21  <the-t-in-rtf> sounds good to me
2020-04-06T14:46:40  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, there's no reason to run this one through me versus anyone else
2020-04-06T14:46:55  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I'm trying to get you to agree to do the next part, i.e. put in the gpii-infra pull… ;)
2020-04-06T14:47:45  <the-t-in-rtf> So, I guess I'd need to know your gcp username and for you to send me a copy of whatever credentials work on your dev cloud.
2020-04-06T14:48:05  <the-t-in-rtf> with that I can at least help with testing and help Yana get set up
2020-04-06T14:49:57  <jhernandez> yeah
2020-04-06T14:50:19  <jhernandez> jhernandez
2020-04-06T14:50:22  <jhernandez> is my gcp username
2020-04-06T14:50:27  <the-t-in-rtf> or you can help Yana, I'm not trying to get in the middle of any conversations I can avoid
2020-04-06T14:50:36  <jhernandez> and I uploaded the testers credentials to it
2020-04-06T14:50:47  <jhernandez> THE REAL DEAL testers credentials :P
2020-04-06T14:50:57  <the-t-in-rtf> great
2020-04-06T14:51:46  <jhernandez> so, do you have the jira created for this promotion to prd?
2020-04-06T14:51:57  <jhernandez> or, do you have a template for thoose?

2020-04-06T15:07:23  <the-t-in-rtf> initially it had a perm error, but once my dev cloud was destroyed it became a network error and palm met face

2020-04-06T19:33:02  <gmoss> ping Justin_o
2020-04-06T19:33:08  <gmoss> or Bosmon or cindyli
2020-04-06T19:33:12  <gmoss> quick infusion question
2020-04-06T19:33:27  <Justin_o> gmoss: just in a meeting, but I can try to reply, or chat afterwards
2020-04-06T19:35:26  <gmoss> Justin_o: sure, reply when you have time :) afterwards is fine.  the question is: is it possible to pass in an IoC reference when specifying an excludeSource record?
2020-04-06T19:35:26  <gmoss> e.g. I want to exclude init and some option on a component, can i say `excludeSource: ["init", "{that}.options.theSourceToExclude"]` or do I have to list the source name explicitly?
2020-04-06T19:35:26  <gmoss> what I'm seeing is the latter case, which doesn't seem right, so I'm looking for confirmation
2020-04-06T19:36:01  <gmoss> like I'd prefer not to have the source to exclude defined in more than one place
2020-04-06T19:37:52  <Justin_o> gmoss: hmm.. I haven't actually tried this before.. but I'd assume it would be the latter
2020-04-06T19:38:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: I guess I just assumed IoC was usable basically everywhere
2020-04-06T19:38:53  <Justin_o> gmoss: I think it might depend on when things need to be evaluated.. it might be different when we get to the point where everything is asynchronous
2020-04-06T19:39:39  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's a fair point. and using IoC may cause expansion to happen too early, depending on the situation
2020-04-06T19:40:03  <gmoss> if it's referring to a subcomponent, or some other component that wouldn't otherwise be ready at that point
2020-04-06T19:41:07  <Justin_o> gmoss: possibly, although I can't completely imagine the situation...
2020-04-06T19:41:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: no worries :) in my particular situation, adding the explicit name of the source solved my issue
2020-04-06T19:41:32  <Justin_o> if Bosmon is around, he'd of course know best, but there might be other issues too
2020-04-06T19:41:44  <Justin_o> okay cool
2020-04-06T19:42:01  <gmoss> I was just hoping there was something I was missing, so that I can eliminate this lightly-smelly code :)

2020-04-06T21:22:35  <colinclark> hey philip, you were asking about “asynchronous data fetching” off channel
2020-04-06T21:22:50  <philip> Yep
2020-04-06T21:22:57  <colinclark> I think I’d need to know more about what kind of data you’re wanting, and whne
2020-04-06T21:22:59  <colinclark> when
2020-04-06T21:23:46  <philip> So, I can write a function that asynchronously gets data from a spreadsheet via the google API
2020-04-06T21:24:41  <philip> If I want to replace that function with a grade, I need to write the grade to somehow execute that API call during or on creation
2020-04-06T21:25:52  <philip> As I understand it, resourceLoader lets you do what I want, but only for getting content out of files
2020-04-06T21:27:25  *** michelled1 <michelled1!~Adium@135-23-104-71.cpe.pppoe.ca> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2020-04-06T21:28:09  <colinclark> what parts of the Google API will you need to get data from?
2020-04-06T21:28:45  <gmoss> philip: "onCreate" is an event you can hook into to execute whatever you like. You could make said API call into an invoker and call that at the right time*
2020-04-06T21:28:45  <gmoss> *the right time will depend on what exactly the data will be put into and whether that has finished creating. I also wonder if remoteModel would apply here
2020-04-06T21:29:48  <philip> colinclark, the google sheets API, as used in this example https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs
2020-04-06T21:30:13  <colinclark> ok, so you have a library yo’re using
2020-04-06T21:30:24  <philip> Yeah
2020-04-06T21:30:26  <colinclark> so you’ll want to do some wrapping and componentizing of it, it sounds like
2020-04-06T21:30:45  <philip> Yep
2020-04-06T21:30:57  <colinclark> gmoss: yes, those are some of the mechanics, but I am trying to understand this a bit more architecturally first.
2020-04-06T21:31:24  <gmoss> colinclark: a fair point :)
2020-04-06T21:31:36  <colinclark> Ah, and you’re an OAuth client, philip
2020-04-06T21:32:37  <philip> gmoss I'm wondering about what "the right time" is here too. I *think* that I want this first component to come into existence with the data, so any other onCreate listeners would not catch it at a point before the data has been fetched
2020-04-06T21:34:51  <gmoss> philip: if you haven't learned it yet, the priority system is a good way to keep things organized chronologically. there's also createOnEvent that you can use to create a component only when a certain event fires, maybe that will be of use. I'll defer to colinclark's advice, though :) please tell me if listing all of these infusion features is more hindrance than help ;)
2020-04-06T21:35:47  <colinclark> more mechanics
2020-04-06T21:35:51  <colinclark> they’re great
2020-04-06T21:35:58  <colinclark> but they’re not the real problem here, I imagine
2020-04-06T21:36:41  <colinclark> I mean, of course you can write some things that fetch data via sheets.spreadsheets.values.get() and bind the callback to a couple of events on your component
2020-04-06T21:37:24  <colinclark> but even just this sample code has several activities going on
2020-04-06T21:38:13  <colinclark> and an OAuth workflow is a bit more subtle than the sample code allows for
2020-04-06T21:38:50  <colinclark> and then you’ll want to actually modelize this data, which is another concern
2020-04-06T21:39:44  <philip> Right. For now I'm just trying to make a grade whose options define a single cell in a single spreadsheet
2020-04-06T21:40:09  <colinclark> I don’t think I fully understand
2020-04-06T21:40:20  *** Bosmon <Bosmon!~Bosmon3@148.252.29.206> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2020-04-06T21:40:22  <colinclark> I mean, I understand the sample code
2020-04-06T21:40:31  <colinclark> but it is nice also to know what sort of a component you envision
2020-04-06T21:40:47  <philip> What's the easiest way to share multiline text?
2020-04-06T21:40:59  <colinclark> a pastebin
2020-04-06T21:41:08  <colinclark> if you’re using IRC Cloud, I think there’s one built in
2020-04-06T21:41:44  <colinclark> this one works: https://pastebin.com/
2020-04-06T21:41:57  <colinclark> I sometimes use Gists too, depending on how persistent I want things to be
2020-04-06T21:42:45  <philip> https://pastebin.com/E3vmU0wq
2020-04-06T21:43:47  <colinclark> aha
2020-04-06T21:44:05  <colinclark> So to start, you want a component with a model that simply holds a value at a particular cell?
2020-04-06T21:44:09  <philip> Yep
2020-04-06T21:45:10  <philip> I understand gmoss' suggestion, to have an onCreate listener that triggers code a la the Google example, which ends by triggering another event that updates the model
2020-04-06T21:47:49  <colinclark> yeah, as i say you’d probably gear some event listeners to the callback
2020-04-06T21:48:13  <colinclark> you know, like “onSuccess” and “onError” and that sort of thing
2020-04-06T21:48:41  <colinclark> but i think you’re going to want to at least have an oauth client component too
2020-04-06T21:48:47  <philip> Aha
2020-04-06T21:48:55  <colinclark> to encompass all that wild globalism in the sample code
2020-04-06T21:49:09  <colinclark> i mean, there’s an intense set of assumptions woven into that code
2020-04-06T21:49:21  <colinclark> which is why i was a little slow to jump to suggestions
2020-04-06T21:49:24  <philip> Okay, good advice. I don't have experience working with oAuth clients
2020-04-06T21:49:25  <colinclark> I was just reading it :)
2020-04-06T21:49:37  <colinclark> nor do I, actually
2020-04-06T21:49:41  <colinclark> cindyli has quite a bit
2020-04-06T21:49:51  <colinclark> and might even suggest some existing tooling for you
2020-04-06T21:50:01  <colinclark> If Tony were around, he’d have some advice
2020-04-06T21:50:06  <philip> But componentizing it should probably also help me once I want to make multiple requests to the API during a single component's lifetime
2020-04-06T21:50:11  <colinclark> yeah
2020-04-06T21:50:45  <colinclark> if I were just wanting to quickly componentize this, I’d probably make a component that represents the oauth session and one that handles fetching data via sheets.spreadsheets.values.get()
2020-04-06T21:50:59  <colinclark> and then you’ll progressively break that into less assumptive pieces
2020-04-06T21:51:09  <philip> Obviously this is just a toy grade so I can set up a working Infusion UI-Nexus-sheet topology
2020-04-06T21:51:15  <colinclark> using all the mechanics gmoss has or will suggest :)
2020-04-06T21:51:41  <philip> Alright, this has definitely helped me break down the problem. Thanks colinclark, gmoss!
2020-04-06T21:51:46  <colinclark> gmoss: Listing the features is totally helpful, don’t worry. It’s just a question of understanding, for the lack of a better term, “the shape of things"
2020-04-06T21:52:33  <colinclark> I always need to do that before I can quite suggest the right mechanic
2020-04-06T21:53:16  <colinclark> developers like simonjb and Bosmon3, I’ve noticed have a particular talent for seeing these things all together, very quickly
2020-04-06T21:53:17  <colinclark> I do not :)
2020-04-06T21:53:19  <gmoss> colinclark: for sure! different approaches to solving the problem, I suppose. mine was a "here are all the tools you can use", yours was a "what tool does this problem require" :)
2020-04-06T21:53:23  <philip> The shape of things is exactly what I'm trying to get my head around :)
2020-04-06T21:53:32  <colinclark> right, that’s what I was thinking too
2020-04-06T21:53:51  <colinclark> A highly reductive heuristic is “make things”
2020-04-06T21:54:02  <colinclark> a lot more things than you think initially
2020-04-06T21:54:34  <colinclark> personally, i also tend to work backwards from a desired model to “how do i get this here?”
2020-04-06T21:55:39  <colinclark> the Sheets fetch API is, itself, pretty simple
2020-04-06T21:56:10  <colinclark> it takes a “search specification” (whatever they call it) and a callback that gets invoked when the results have been fetched
2020-04-06T21:56:35  <gmoss> colinclark: I like your idea of keeping a component to query the API separate from the rest, since this can later be adapted to, for example, get more than a single cell at a time in order to save overhead
2020-04-06T21:56:52  <colinclark> your callback here most simply maps to a thing that inspects the two arguments and fires appropriately more fine-grained events, philip
2020-04-06T21:57:16  <colinclark> and then you can have a listener that maps data to your model
2020-04-06T21:57:32  <colinclark> probably in it’s initial, most simple form, with a ChangeApplier “change spec”
2020-04-06T21:57:33  <simonjb> this sounds like a very interesting conversation! (catching up after colinclark's ping)
2020-04-06T21:58:03  <colinclark> a listener like {changePath: “value”, value: rows[x][y]} or whatever

2020-04-06T21:58:20  <colinclark> but these things will get more complex verrry quickly

2020-04-06T22:01:49  <simonjb> gmoss: this is my latest program for crashing SJRK: https://github.com/simonbates/crash-sjrk/blob/master/crash_sjrk_3.py it's a little funky! Currently, I don't think the issue is purely load-related. But rather, I suspect some non-happy-path code path under load. This program sets up processes sending batches of requests and then kills them. It's the killing that crashes the server

2020-04-06T22:06:14  <gmoss> simonjb: was just reading the script :) so the killing of the requests being the trigger seems to jive with the error message, since it's trying to do something with a thread that no longer exists.
2020-04-06T22:06:46  <simonjb> gmoss: yes
2020-04-06T22:06:49  <gmoss> sorry, trying to change gears from the autosave stuff haha. do you get the sense that this is something I should adjust in the Storytelling Tool?

2020-04-06T22:07:48  <simonjb> gmoss: I don't know yet. Will need more investigation. I'll write up my experience so far for you and Bosmon, Bosmon3 to look at
2020-04-06T22:07:52  <gmoss> as in, I'm trying to think of what I'm requesting and then suddenly stopping
2020-04-06T22:08:01  <gmoss> simonjb: that's much appreciated :)
2020-04-06T22:08:32  <simonjb> gmoss: independent of what the client does, it shouldn't be able to crash the server
2020-04-06T22:09:04  <gmoss> simonjb: I agree
2020-04-06T22:09:09  <simonjb> gmoss: so there may be a workaround to change the client code, but the server needs to be fixed
2020-04-06T22:09:23  <colinclark> understatement of the month, simonjb
2020-04-06T22:09:39  <simonjb> :)
2020-04-06T22:13:49  <colinclark> btw philip, the mechanic you’ll eventually want, which I’m not sure if gmoss mentioned or not, is a “DataSource”
2020-04-06T22:14:31  <colinclark> A thing which is responsible for CRUD-style data access
2020-04-06T22:15:17  <colinclark> with invokers which rather uncannily match the semantic of the Google Sheets API, such as “get” and “set” ;)
2020-04-06T22:15:36  <gmoss> colinclark: I had not mentioned that one yet! seems like a reasonable choice. the basic DataSource is wired for JSON comsumption, iirc, so you may not need to do much customization if that's what the Sheets API spits out (I didn't look at the sample code)
2020-04-06T22:15:51  <colinclark> that’s what it spits out, yes

2020-04-06T22:17:32  <colinclark> I don’t know where the best source of documentation is, philip, but we migrated fluid.dataSource out of Kettle, so there’s always this: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/DataSources.md
2020-04-06T22:17:55  <gmoss> philip, colinclark: I believe there are some differences between `fluid.DataSource` and `kettle.DataSource`, or at the very least they may be duplications of one another. I would suggest exploring which is best for your purposes (I'm guessing the former)
2020-04-06T22:18:13  <colinclark> the former was migrated to the latter
2020-04-06T22:18:23  <colinclark> sorry
2020-04-06T22:18:27  <colinclark> latter to the former
2020-04-06T22:18:28  <colinclark> whatever
2020-04-06T22:18:45  <colinclark> I imagine you’ve got a wealth of sample code, gmoss :)
2020-04-06T22:19:58  <gmoss> colinclark philip: yep, the Storytelling Tool has some DataSource action :) FWIW there is also some documentation for implemented features that is still in pull requests on the docs repo, as well: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/142
2020-04-06T22:20:52  <colinclark> oh great!
2020-04-06T22:21:12  <colinclark> i wasn’t sure if there were docs or not for the cross-platform DataSource
