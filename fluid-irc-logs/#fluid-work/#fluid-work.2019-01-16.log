2019-01-16T10:19:04  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Hey there, good morning!
2019-01-16T10:23:20  <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, JJ
2019-01-16T10:23:24  <the-t-in-rtf> one of the two people I wanted to see!
2019-01-16T10:23:25  <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2019-01-16T10:23:58  <the-t-in-rtf> I am working on the Solutions Registry validation, which means the era of TODO: write this schema is over
2019-01-16T10:24:05  <the-t-in-rtf> I have two I need help with.
2019-01-16T10:25:16  <the-t-in-rtf> I was hoping you or @stegru could comment:
2019-01-16T10:25:17  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L5581
2019-01-16T10:25:29  <the-t-in-rtf> That is currently incomplete and borderline nonsensical.
2019-01-16T10:25:50  <the-t-in-rtf> an empty enum is not allowed, in part because it means nothing is acceptable
2019-01-16T10:25:58  <the-t-in-rtf> there's also no enum labels
2019-01-16T10:26:09  <the-t-in-rtf> there's also the matter of type: array
2019-01-16T10:26:34  <the-t-in-rtf> I was hoping someone could just point me to an example of two of the data
2019-01-16T10:26:58  <the-t-in-rtf> worse case, we make a general check and leave ourselves notes for the future, best case we can actually describe what's allowed better
2019-01-16T10:27:33  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "I am working on the Solutions Re"> woooo a truly new era
2019-01-16T10:28:24  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/elmerv.json5#L24
2019-01-16T10:28:35  <the-t-in-rtf> so, is that a reasonable example of what people will enter there?
2019-01-16T10:28:44  <the-t-in-rtf> or is elmerv badly out of date?
2019-01-16T10:29:12  <the-t-in-rtf> if it's accurate, then I can pretty trivially whip up a schema
2019-01-16T10:29:21  <the-t-in-rtf> it not, I need up-to-date examples
2019-01-16T10:29:53  <javjarfer[m]> well, that's a good question
2019-01-16T10:30:00  <the-t-in-rtf> FYI, the data in testData/preferences will be validated as part of this.
2019-01-16T10:30:19  <the-t-in-rtf> well, I assume there are tests somewhere for the setting, RIGHT?
2019-01-16T10:31:39  <javjarfer[m]> because display resolutions vary with the screen format directly
2019-01-16T10:31:59  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L513
2019-01-16T10:32:13  <javjarfer[m]> so, I don't think there is a way to properly validate the screen resolution, without knowing which screen is the one in which the resolution is going to be set
2019-01-16T10:32:13  <the-t-in-rtf> sure, we can't enumerate the full range of values, I get that
2019-01-16T10:32:18  <the-t-in-rtf> nonsense
2019-01-16T10:32:28  <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the schema could say that you have to have a width and height element
2019-01-16T10:32:33  <the-t-in-rtf> and that they have to be positive numbers
2019-01-16T10:32:44  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "I mean, the schema could say tha"> that's great
2019-01-16T10:32:48  <the-t-in-rtf> that's a lot more properly validated than what we have
2019-01-16T10:32:58  <javjarfer[m]> positive, and with bounds? is that possible
2019-01-16T10:33:04  <the-t-in-rtf> oh, absolutely
2019-01-16T10:33:05  <javjarfer[m]> like maximum 4k displays
2019-01-16T10:33:23  <the-t-in-rtf> aren't there already 8k displays?
2019-01-16T10:33:36  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, we can start with simple boundaries and tighten it down
2019-01-16T10:33:38  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I think so, but haven't seen one with my eyes
2019-01-16T10:33:40  <javjarfer[m]> xD
2019-01-16T10:33:51  <the-t-in-rtf> you see the 8K ones with YOUR MIND
2019-01-16T10:34:02  <the-t-in-rtf> the emperor's new monitor
2019-01-16T10:34:07  <javjarfer[m]> it's a fairy tale for me right now
2019-01-16T10:34:09  <javjarfer[m]> hahaha
2019-01-16T10:34:21  <javjarfer[m]> yes, I can see in 8k with my bare eyes
2019-01-16T10:34:22  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I'm gonna add a schema that matches the tests
2019-01-16T10:34:33  <the-t-in-rtf> if that's not what we're passing around, someone will have some explaining to do
2019-01-16T10:38:42  <the-t-in-rtf> Soo, who onboarded the narrator?
2019-01-16T10:38:45  <the-t-in-rtf> it has no schemas
2019-01-16T10:38:59  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not mad, but no one gets out of here alive until I add them.
2019-01-16T10:39:36  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3934
2019-01-16T10:40:13  <the-t-in-rtf> I can hopefully infer stuff from the transforms, but whomever did that would be a nice person if they volunteered to review my work.
2019-01-16T10:41:11  <stegru> I did the original narrator.. but there's currently an update to it under review
2019-01-16T10:41:21  <the-t-in-rtf> link?
2019-01-16T10:41:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I can cherry pick the relevant commits.
2019-01-16T10:41:56  <the-t-in-rtf> or merge depending on the size of it.
2019-01-16T10:41:59  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/231
2019-01-16T10:42:02  <the-t-in-rtf> thanks
2019-01-16T10:42:24  <the-t-in-rtf> can you update that one to fix the merge conflicts?
2019-01-16T10:42:33  <the-t-in-rtf> I'd like to nudge @bosmon to merge it if possible
2019-01-16T10:42:41  <stegru> correct repo: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/622
2019-01-16T10:43:36  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I was gonna say, no changes to win32.json there
2019-01-16T10:43:40  <stegru> it looks like you're already sticking your oar in it
2019-01-16T10:44:47  <Bosmon> You will put in your oar!
2019-01-16T10:46:35  <the-t-in-rtf> Any chance of merging 622, @Bosmon?  That's the only validation failure left.
2019-01-16T10:46:47  <the-t-in-rtf> I'd rather not pick apart the pull and cherry pick commits if that can just be merged.
2019-01-16T10:47:07  <the-t-in-rtf> In the mean time I'll move on to the remaining validation checks
2019-01-16T10:47:22  <Bosmon> We can have it, if I can run the tests for it : P
2019-01-16T10:47:24  <Bosmon> I'll have a go
2019-01-16T10:47:36  <the-t-in-rtf> it worked in CI yesterday, but I understand
2019-01-16T10:49:07  <Bosmon> I'm sure you do : P
2019-01-16T10:49:32  <Bosmon> NULLIUS IN VERBA
2019-01-16T10:56:48  <javjarfer[m]> <freenode_the "I'm not mad, but no one gets out"> haha was me
2019-01-16T11:00:54  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Will you have time for a couple of questions about a weird behavior I was observing yesterday? Maybe we have a bug in SR
2019-01-16T11:01:49  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I'll try to listen, will be getting out of the door in a bit ...
2019-01-16T11:03:12  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: okay, I will be quick, so, if you try to use this solution https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6652
2019-01-16T11:03:47  * javjarfer[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/mMDzcgsepxKxFPwIgspUfjEk >
2019-01-16T11:04:37  <javjarfer[m]> the rest of the settings are called with some "default" values, that I can only guess where the system finds.
2019-01-16T11:05:01  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I'm gonna standardise this bit: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L2
2019-01-16T11:05:21  <javjarfer[m]> but in particular, the nativeSettingsHandler is called with a payload with a setting, being this setting a empty object
2019-01-16T11:05:21  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm moving all the schema definitions into schema elements and collapsing the enclosing "schemas" entry.
2019-01-16T11:06:03  <javjarfer[m]> This makes systemSettingsHandler to fail in line https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/nativeSettingsHandler/src/nativeSettingsHandler.js#L135
2019-01-16T11:06:52  <javjarfer[m]> Which is expected behavior because we always expect well formed payloads in the settingsHandler side
2019-01-16T11:07:31  <javjarfer[m]> Question is, where are this default values got from, and why is the system sending a payload with a empty object inside?
2019-01-16T11:13:48  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - why doesn't the setting name agree with the one in the registry?
2019-01-16T11:14:05  <Bosmon> One is "SwapMouseButtons" and the other is "SwapMouseButtonsConfig"
2019-01-16T11:15:24  <javjarfer[m]> Yes, the mapped setting is SwapMouseButtons, "SwapMouseButtonsConfig" is just the configuration block for the setting
2019-01-16T11:16:31  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - mapped setting?
2019-01-16T11:16:37  <Bosmon> As far as I can see it is the actual name of the setting: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L6676
2019-01-16T11:18:16  <javjarfer[m]> yes, sorry , that's the setting name, the other is the map used for the setting
2019-01-16T11:18:42  <Bosmon> So, this should be the name used in the preferences, right?
2019-01-16T11:20:08  <javjarfer[m]> yes
2019-01-16T11:20:20  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], I assume you onboarded RWG?
2019-01-16T11:20:31  <the-t-in-rtf> it has a capability that doesn't actually exist
2019-01-16T11:20:32  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3380
2019-01-16T11:21:16  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: well, I didn't
2019-01-16T11:21:22  <javjarfer[m]> so that's a great and nice surprise
2019-01-16T11:22:22  <javjarfer[m]> thanks for the info the-t-in-rtf , I need to try that solution today with the software after finishing a couple of pulls
2019-01-16T11:22:26  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, new checks are like x-rays
2019-01-16T11:22:37  <the-t-in-rtf> you see things clearly that were previously hidden
2019-01-16T11:22:56  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf: that's magic
2019-01-16T11:30:35  <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: javjarfer[m] wrt RWG and any other solution in the solutions registry, remember that some of them were added during cloud4all and that some of them only received "enough love" to keep the working - others are completely out of date and haven't been tested for ages
2019-01-16T11:31:15  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, tests will make it clear what's what
2019-01-16T11:31:28  <the-t-in-rtf> humans suck at hand curating that kind of stuff
2019-01-16T11:31:43  <the-t-in-rtf> whereas a good test is a bug-killing machine sent from the future
2019-01-16T11:31:44  <jhernandez> so searching for guilty people does not make any sense - you can always blame kasparnet
2019-01-16T11:31:45  <jhernandez> :)
2019-01-16T11:31:56  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm not searching for guilt
2019-01-16T11:32:01  <the-t-in-rtf> only knowledge of the area
2019-01-16T11:32:08  <jhernandez> yeah
2019-01-16T11:32:15  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't care how it got that way, I only care that my "fix" is accurate
2019-01-16T11:32:26  <the-t-in-rtf> or as accurate as we can manage this go round
2019-01-16T11:32:35  <jhernandez> I remember updating RWG some time ago for a demo, that's all
2019-01-16T11:41:07  <javjarfer[m]> that's great jhernandez, do you remember how long ago that demo took place?
2019-01-16T11:41:27  <jhernandez> for ATIA?
2019-01-16T11:41:33  <jhernandez> can't remember well
2019-01-16T11:41:48  <jhernandez> I think it was even before
2019-01-16T11:46:36  <javjarfer[m]> great, thank, I will look this afternoon to it
2019-01-16T12:21:09  <the-t-in-rtf> Just saw the merge, thanks @Bosmon (and @javjarfer[m])

2019-01-16T14:12:36  <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], is there a pull to add schemas for these? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3395
2019-01-16T14:24:10  <javjarfer[m]> the-t-in-rtf , no there isn't any pull for they yet
2019-01-16T14:24:53  <javjarfer[m]> I will be testing the solution this afternoon, I will add the proper schemas to the pull
2019-01-16T14:25:04  <the-t-in-rtf> It's OK, I softened up the requirement for a schema in favour of a warning...
