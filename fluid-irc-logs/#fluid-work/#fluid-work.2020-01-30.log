2020-01-30T13:57:04  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, I'm working on FLUID-6421 ( https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6421 ). I'm spinning my wheels a bit thinking about how to get the container selectors updated. We talked about this last time and the suggestion was "In the case of autogeneration the container selectors from the auxiliary schema will be ignored and replaced by options distributions for the generated container classes."
2020-01-30T13:57:15  <Justin_o> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6421?focusedCommentId=40947&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40947
2020-01-30T13:58:03  <Justin_o> But in thinking about it more, I'm not sure how to best accomplish this. The issue here being that we need to generate those selectors from the supplied preferences
2020-01-30T13:58:19  <Bosmon> From the supplied preferences?
2020-01-30T13:58:32  <Justin_o> Bosmon: well, requested preference names
2020-01-30T13:58:39  <Bosmon> Surely they are generated from the aux schema grades and related grades

2020-01-30T13:59:48  <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. I guess what you're saying is that the auxiliary builder just ignores what's in the schema and makes its own verison
2020-01-30T13:59:59  <Justin_o> version
2020-01-30T14:00:20  <Bosmon> Justin_o - in that configuration, yes - and this is what gets issued via the distributions
2020-01-30T14:00:56  <Justin_o> Bosmon: can you explain what the options distribution does here, I'm not really sure why it's needed
2020-01-30T14:01:17  <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I guess they might not be if you can act during the aux builder building process
2020-01-30T14:01:28  <Justin_o> is it just distributing the option that says we're generating our own containers?
2020-01-30T14:01:52  <Justin_o> okay, yes... that's what I was thinking
2020-01-30T14:03:07  <Justin_o> thanks

2020-01-30T14:50:41  <simonjb> Justin_o: I tried installing sjrk-story-telling on my home computer with Node 12 this morning but it failed on compiling leveldown. However, my computer isn't correctly set up for node-gyp: I'm using Visual Studio build tools 2019 and Python 3.8 for a personal project, while node-gyp on Windows needs VS 2017 and Python 2.7. I'm not going to change my computer at home, but when I am in
2020-01-30T14:50:41  <simonjb> work, I can set my work computer up for Node 12 and correct node-gyp dependencies and test there. My work computer currently has Node 10, but c2lc is building fine on Node 12, so I'm happy to switch.

2020-01-30T18:34:50  <sgithens> cindyli: So, if we're going to send different versions of preferences based on what version of the solutions registry the client is on, does that mean we'll have to start storing them in our repo somewhere? Like win32-1.0.json5, win32-2.0.json and whatnot?
2020-01-30T18:42:07  <cindyli> sgithens: i guess so, Bosmon mentioned in https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4329 to have a metadata.json5 indicating the version of SR but i believe at the point he didn't expect there could be multiple SR files
2020-01-30T18:42:36  <cindyli> i'm also not very clear about having multiple SR files
2020-01-30T18:44:34  <sgithens> It just occurred to me because, with the GPII-3119 change, and probably other future changes, since it requires a code update, the client would have to use the version their code supported, and so we'd have to have that version lying around somewhere to use? Or maybe it still doesn't matter if all the processing is done on the server anyway
2020-01-30T18:44:39  <sgithens> something to think about
2020-01-30T18:45:01  <sgithens> I guess I should write out some of these scenerios
2020-01-30T18:49:50  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2020-01-30T18:50:35  <cindyli> writing out scenarios is a great idea, sgithens. in terms of the issue that https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4329 will solve, all SR processing will be on the cloud
2020-01-30T18:57:23  <cindyli> actually, after pondering more on GPII-4329 with GPII-4273, I do have a question about whether all SR processing can be done on the cloud. i will write it down as a comment on GPII-4329

2020-01-30T20:11:16  <Bosmon> sgithens, cindyli - the expectation is we will not need multiple files
2020-01-30T20:11:34  <Bosmon> Since we expect the information content of the current solutions registry to exceed or be equal to all of its predecessours
2020-01-30T20:11:38  <Bosmon> All we will need is an array of transforms
2020-01-30T20:12:48  <cindyli> Bosmon: i wrote this comment to ask about a couple of questions - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-4329?focusedCommentId=42416&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-42416 one of them is about how to fetch the full SR in an older version
2020-01-30T20:13:29  <cindyli> it might be too overwhelming for the cloud to do transformations on a full SR for each key in requesting an older version of SR
2020-01-30T20:13:40  <Bosmon> I think it will be fine
2020-01-30T20:13:49  <Bosmon> Remember that it only needs to transform solutionsRegistryEntries
2020-01-30T20:13:59  <Bosmon> All we are concerned about is producing data in a FORMAT that the client can't understand
2020-01-30T20:14:19  <Bosmon> We can't transform the entire SR up front otherwise the codebase itself won't understand it
2020-01-30T20:15:55  <cindyli> Bosmon: if the client is using the old LFM code, what currently in the master, for doing private match making locally, this client will need a full SR in the old version
2020-01-30T20:16:00  <cindyli> isn't it?
2020-01-30T20:16:45  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, but clown's work has already taken care of that
2020-01-30T20:16:49  <Bosmon> These two activities are complementary
2020-01-30T20:17:07  * clown ears are burning
2020-01-30T20:17:19  <Bosmon> clown's work takes care of processing on the client on an original SR, and your work ensures that the client will not receive data within solutionsRegistryEntries that it can't understand
2020-01-30T20:17:25  <cindyli> Bosmon: clown's work is to make sure the client gets the same SR used by the cloud
2020-01-30T20:17:51  <Bosmon> cindyli - oh yeah, so it does : P
2020-01-30T20:18:34  <Bosmon> ok then, so we do indeed have some issues
2020-01-30T20:18:38  <Bosmon> Silly me
2020-01-30T20:19:11  <Bosmon> Seems best then to indeed store encodings of the CURRENT SR in all previous encodings
2020-01-30T20:19:27  <Bosmon> This can be a build-time task, much like the one that produces our "codex"
2020-01-30T20:19:47  <Bosmon> Then the client can request the same SR as the cloud, but in an encoding that matches its own version
2020-01-30T20:19:53  <Bosmon> Simply by doing some URL interpolation
2020-01-30T20:19:58  <Bosmon> What a hilarious situation
2020-01-30T20:21:17  <Bosmon> This still means you have the same task of reencoding solutionsRegistryEntries, just before dispatch
2020-01-30T20:21:32  <Bosmon> It just means you have the extra work of producing the build-time task, which calls the same function that you will implement
2020-01-30T20:23:37  <cindyli> Bosmon: does it mean the build time task will run the same tranformation on the SR used by the cloud to convert it to different versions of SRs for the client to fetch?
2020-01-30T20:23:49  <Bosmon> cindyli - exactly
2020-01-30T20:24:22  <Bosmon> clown's "fake client solutionsRegistryDataSource" will then accept an extra parameter, which is the SR version expected by the client
2020-01-30T20:24:42  <Bosmon> Which it use as an extra term in its URL when it interpolates the base name of the SR file to fetch
2020-01-30T20:24:52  <cindyli> Bosmon: ok, clown's work is fetching from github. does it mean all converted SRs somehow need to be committed into github
2020-01-30T20:25:05  <Bosmon> cindyli - argh
2020-01-30T20:25:10  <Bosmon> .....
2020-01-30T20:25:16  <cindyli> haha
2020-01-30T20:25:22  <Bosmon> fecking feck
2020-01-30T20:26:35  <clown> brb
2020-01-30T20:29:31  <Bosmon> ok well
2020-01-30T20:29:52  <Bosmon> Sad to say, I can't think of a quick way out of this without invalidating all of clown's work :(
2020-01-30T20:30:01  <Bosmon> Perhaps someone else can : P
2020-01-30T20:30:39  <Bosmon> My first idea about a quick way out is to indeed have the old versions of the SR constructed as a built step, but then have them just served as static files via the CBFM
2020-01-30T20:30:52  <Bosmon> This means all of this malarky about serving the SR out of github has to go
2020-01-30T20:31:40  <Bosmon> We can't serve the stuff out of npm because npm only serves tarballs which would be ridiculous to expect the client to unpack
2020-01-30T20:31:52  <Bosmon> And we can't have a build-time step that operates before a git commit because that is antireligious
2020-01-30T20:31:53  <cindyli> and it would be a lot of work load for the cloud if hundreds clients are requesting SRs at the same time. SR is a big file
2020-01-30T20:32:12  <Bosmon> cindyli - serving a static file for the cloud will be a pretty tiny workload
2020-01-30T20:32:17  <Bosmon> In practice, cloud load is primarily DB load
2020-01-30T20:32:24  <cindyli> ok
2020-01-30T20:32:49  <Bosmon> Another option might be to take a further step forward to having a genuine "live SR" and put all these SR files into a completely separate repository
2020-01-30T20:33:13  <Bosmon> And then just make sure that before we ever push a new CBFM to the cloud, we have statically published all the appropriate files into this new SR repository
2020-01-30T20:33:21  <Bosmon> That way we can keep a good quantity of clown's work
2020-01-30T20:33:57  <Bosmon> It's just that the references it serves will be a reference into the LSR repo rather than to universal
2020-01-30T20:34:15  <Bosmon> And it only contains SR file for CBFMs that have ever been deployed to the cloud
2020-01-30T20:34:42  <Bosmon> They can still be keyed by the full git hash of universal git commits as before
2020-01-30T20:35:17  <Bosmon> ALthough in practice we want to start moving away from having universal commits in lockstep with SR commits anyway
2020-01-30T20:35:49  <cindyli> Bosmon: will "live SR" contains all versions of SRs built from the latest SR version
2020-01-30T20:35:59  <Bosmon> In practice each such update will need a full round of QA, so there isn't too much to gain from this
2020-01-30T20:37:21  <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, it will, although I think in practice it will also contain all previous SRs built in formats which are older than tham
2020-01-30T20:37:39  <Bosmon> There's no reason to ever delete anything from this "LSR", it will in effect behave like a module registry
2020-01-30T20:38:06  <Bosmon> Every time we roll out a new CBFM, there will be a new git hash for its SR, and we will generate all historical formats of it that we know about
2020-01-30T20:38:13  <Bosmon> And then we will add these as new files into the repo
2020-01-30T20:38:25  <Bosmon> tham -> them
2020-01-30T20:38:46  <cindyli> i hope this process can be automated. otherwise, quite a bit tedious work...
2020-01-30T20:39:09  <Bosmon> cindyli - sure, there will be a one-shot build process that produces the new files, then it is just "git commit -a" and push : P
2020-01-30T20:39:23  <cindyli> cool
