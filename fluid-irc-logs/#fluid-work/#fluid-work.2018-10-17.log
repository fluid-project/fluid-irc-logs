2018-10-17T15:08:13  <clown> Hi Bosmon:  I just saw that you merged my new dataloader universal pull.  Just wondering about this line, which references my docker image:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L45
2018-10-17T15:08:22  <clown> I guess it's correct of now.
2018-10-17T15:08:25  <clown> *for now
2018-10-17T15:09:28  <clown> But will have to change when the associated gpii-dataloader pull is merged (https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-dataloader/pull/6)

2018-10-17T15:11:56  <Bosmon> clown - sure - would it do any harm to fix it now?
2018-10-17T15:13:45  <clown> Probably â€” the two pulls are meant to work togetther.  I've never tried runing the new universal code with the old gpii-dataloader code.
2018-10-17T15:14:00  <clown> It didn't occur to me that was a real scenario.
2018-10-17T15:14:47  <Bosmon> Well, it's not a scenario, but git doesn't support atomic commits across repos : P

2018-10-17T15:24:36  <Bosmon> Well, not really
2018-10-17T15:24:44  <Bosmon> Let's get this right, since it will only make testing itself impossible
2018-10-17T15:25:04  <Bosmon> Should it read GPII/gpii-dataloader or what?
2018-10-17T15:29:09  <clown> It should read herrclown/gpii-dataloader.
2018-10-17T15:30:22  <Bosmon> mrtyler seemed to think it should be reverted to gpii/gpii-dataloader
2018-10-17T15:31:02  <clown> that should happen when my gpii-dataloader pull request goes in.
2018-10-17T15:31:49  <clown> after that, it's moot since herrclonw/gpii-dataloader and GPII/gpii-dataloader will be the same.

2018-10-17T16:54:15  <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - we haven't caught up for a while :)
2018-10-17T16:54:26  <Bosmon> I've been seeing a lot of "cities" stuff going by
2018-10-17T16:54:44  <Bosmon> It's looking very interesting
2018-10-17T16:57:02  <Bosmon> I was wondering if you might have time to look over a smallish Kettle pull - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/49/files
2018-10-17T16:57:24  <Bosmon> No worries if you are a bit pressed, I'm sure I can run it by someone else
2018-10-17T17:00:16  <simonjb> hi Bosmon, it has been a while! I was unfortunately quite sick in September and missed a bunch of work
2018-10-17T17:00:28  <Bosmon> Sorry to hear that
2018-10-17T17:00:52  <simonjb> I really enjoyed the community meeting and PPIG
2018-10-17T17:01:09  <simonjb> what a great event you organised
2018-10-17T17:02:01  <simonjb> Bosmon: the cities project has been really interesting; Toronto is in a very interesting position with regards to Sidewalk Labs
2018-10-17T17:02:24  <Bosmon> It's great you've been able to keep the conversation going
2018-10-17T17:02:33  <simonjb> and yes, I can make time to review the kettle PR
2018-10-17T17:04:03  <Bosmon> See also pm :)
2018-10-17T17:04:20  <Bosmon> Thanks so much
2018-10-17T17:04:56  <simonjb> Bosmon: pm?

2018-10-17T17:15:44  <jhernandez> btw, I was going to add the bits to copy (or rename) the defaultSettings.json file

2018-10-17T17:16:27  <jhernandez> I think of many different ways to achieve this but can't tell which one is the best
2018-10-17T17:19:10  <jhernandez> from the many options, I think that we can either a) include the defaultSettings.json file in gpii-wix-installer, or b) rename/copy the file from the gpii-app's npm postInstall script
2018-10-17T17:20:12  <jhernandez> at this moment I can do it manually, but we should think about how we want to ship it
2018-10-17T17:21:08  <jhernandez> not sure if this "standard configuration" fits into gpii-app's siteconfig though
2018-10-17T17:21:10  <jhernandez> Bosmon, cindyli: ^
2018-10-17T17:22:38  <Bosmon> jhernandez - where would b) cpy it to?
2018-10-17T17:22:40  <Bosmon> copy
2018-10-17T17:23:23  <jhernandez> I'd say to gpii-universal/testData/snapshots
2018-10-17T17:23:34  <Bosmon> Oh I see
2018-10-17T17:23:49  <Bosmon> I think cindyli supported a more public location for it
2018-10-17T17:24:17  <jhernandez> yup, and this is actually being done internally
2018-10-17T17:24:59  <jhernandez> it's enough by just renaming the defaultSettings.win32.json as defaultSettings.json
2018-10-17T17:25:48  <jhernandez> Bosmon: this is described at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ResetComputer.md

2018-10-17T17:54:32  <simonjb> hi Justin_o, I'm looking at your PR for FLUID-6298; it's been a while since I worked on Infusion and I'm seeing and error that I don't understand in FF Console
2018-10-17T17:54:52  <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks for having a look.. what error are you seeing?
2018-10-17T17:55:24  <simonjb> when I load the prefsFramework demo locally, I see an error parsing "http://127.0.0.1:8080/demos/prefsFramework/messages/simplify_en.json" but don't see this error at https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/
2018-10-17T17:55:35  <simonjb> I'm likely missing a build step?
2018-10-17T17:57:35  <simonjb> what I've done: npm install, grunt, grunt buildStylus, then server root of project
2018-10-17T17:57:49  <simonjb> are those the right steps? any not necessary, or missing others?
2018-10-17T17:58:17  <Justin_o> simonjb: that should be enough, actually you should get that error in both spots. it's because the simplify doesn't have localized versions, so it falls back to simplify.json
2018-10-17T17:58:56  <Justin_o> simonjb: i just checked the build step and am getting the 404 for simplify_en.json
2018-10-17T17:59:07  <Justin_o> perhaps there is something caching for the build site for you?
2018-10-17T18:00:05  <simonjb> it's interesting, for me in FF, I see the 404 on the Network tab, but no error in Console tab (for build site)
2018-10-17T18:00:24  <Justin_o> ah i was looking in chrome.. let me check firefox
2018-10-17T18:01:14  <simonjb> but locally I see both 404 in Network and error in Console
2018-10-17T18:01:24  <simonjb> in Firefox also

2018-10-17T18:01:55  <Justin_o> simonjb: do you think it could be related to the server?
2018-10-17T18:02:37  <Justin_o> I believe I'm using nginx through docker
2018-10-17T18:02:40  <simonjb> yes, definitely could be, though surely a 404 is a 404?
2018-10-17T18:02:50  <Justin_o> maybe something with the headers?

2018-10-17T18:05:26  <simonjb> ok, the 404 responses differ -- nginx returns a 404 HTML page (build site), whereas the server I'm using locally (the nodejs http-server) returns an empty response
2018-10-17T18:05:33  <simonjb> Justin_o ^
2018-10-17T18:06:02  <simonjb> that is, an empty response body

2018-10-17T19:49:31  <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru, cindyli: FYI, testing an installer with everything together and, while playing around, got an error and the log is telling the following https://pastebin.com/gvrJQ7Qe
2018-10-17T19:49:50  <jhernandez> that looks horrible
2018-10-17T19:50:30  <Bosmon> Astonishing and horrible
2018-10-17T19:50:34  <Bosmon> Definitely one for stegru :)
2018-10-17T19:51:06  <Bosmon> Is this with ffi-napi or did we back out to the forked ffi?
2018-10-17T19:53:01  <jhernandez> this one is using the official ffi, since we're still in electron 1.8
2018-10-17T19:53:13  <jhernandez> neither napi nor forked ffi involved
2018-10-17T19:55:05  <jhernandez> amazingly, I continued playing around and it behaves "normal"
2018-10-17T19:55:15  <jhernandez> trying to reproduce the problem again

2018-10-17T19:59:16  <stegru> that doesn't look nice
2018-10-17T20:01:58  *** cindyli <cindyli!~Adium@205.211.168.101> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
2018-10-17T20:02:25  <jhernandez> ok, looks like it's happening when issuing a reset
2018-10-17T20:02:32  <jhernandez> hmmm
2018-10-17T20:02:45  <jhernandez> I can share the installer with you
2018-10-17T20:03:39  <jhernandez> and also, push my branch for you to build locally
2018-10-17T20:04:32  <stegru> hst removal looks ok, javi
2018-10-17T20:04:54  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, I used it in my current build and it's fine
2018-10-17T20:05:03  <jhernandez> uploading the installer now
2018-10-17T20:05:08  <stegru> ok
2018-10-17T20:05:44  <stegru> the error is in the process reporter.. but I think that's just a symptom of something else
2018-10-17T20:05:55  <stegru> error/failure
2018-10-17T20:06:50  <jhernandez> okay, in fact you can use gpii-app/ajc3 to reproduce the issue
2018-10-17T20:08:15  <jhernandez> the only difference with my local branch  is the hst removal and the change to use the production cluster
2018-10-17T20:15:04  <jhernandez> I have leave now
2018-10-17T20:16:04  <jhernandez> later I'll try to reproduce the issue from the source code

2018-10-17T20:17:04  <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru: I've shared the installer with you
2018-10-17T20:18:05  <stegru> i'll sort it out in the morning
2018-10-17T20:18:11  <jhernandez> stegru: thanks for merging the hst-tools one
2018-10-17T20:19:01  <jhernandez> cool
2018-10-17T20:19:04  <jhernandez> and thanks
2018-10-17T20:19:09  <jhernandez> cheers!
