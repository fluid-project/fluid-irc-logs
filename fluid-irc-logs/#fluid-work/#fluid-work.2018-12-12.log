2018-12-12T12:46:25  <stegru> I think i've made an interesting random number generator
2018-12-12T12:47:09  <Bosmon> It's not a really great one

2018-12-12T13:20:07  <Bosmon> Fantastic, stegru
2018-12-12T13:20:09  <Bosmon> You made it
2018-12-12T13:21:46  <stegru> for that one - I have another in a different branch. quite annoying, because I thought they where the same thing
2018-12-12T13:30:38  <the-t-in-rtf> stupid question to anyone listening, what's the setting or flag to launch gpii.js (in Windows, let's say) without using the canned installedSolutions.json data?
2018-12-12T13:38:24  <the-t-in-rtf> I have what I see as a problem when testing one installed solution when others aren't installed, but it might just be a byproduct of the way I'm working.
2018-12-12T13:39:53  <the-t-in-rtf> so, for example, I was testing MAGic, added a settings file with only MAGic specific settings.
2018-12-12T13:40:19  <the-t-in-rtf> the matchmaker transformed the application specific settings into generic equivalents, and then transformed those into settings for other applications
2018-12-12T13:40:43  <the-t-in-rtf> and tried to update the settings for those, which caused the login to fail because the directories didn't exist for the non-installed solutions
2018-12-12T13:40:49  <the-t-in-rtf> (JAWS)
2018-12-12T13:41:08  <the-t-in-rtf> so, if it were detecting what was installed and only trying to apply settings for installed stuff, no problem
2018-12-12T13:41:26  <the-t-in-rtf> or if it weren't trying to cross-walk from application1->common->application2
2018-12-12T13:41:32  <the-t-in-rtf> it would also not be a problem

2018-12-12T19:05:12  <bryan_> Bosmon: so I got the VM running properly with help from sgithens . I deleted the VM and node_modules and then did vagrant up and it started fine. I think doing npm install locally is what was causing the EBUSY errors when vagrant tried to do npm install on top
2018-12-12T19:06:59  <Bosmon> bryan_ - sure
2018-12-12T19:07:15  <Bosmon> But we should have got past that by doing rm -rf node_modules lots of times

2018-12-12T19:36:47  <sgithens> Bosmon bryan_  I will occasionally see this... I'm not sure if it has to do with underlying filesystem differences or something, but every once in a while my npm installs inside the VM just won't work, and I need to build it from scratch by deleting the VM from virtualbox and 'vagrant up'ing from scratch.
2018-12-12T19:36:55  <sgithens> It's not entirely consistent though
2018-12-12T19:37:01  <sgithens> it just happens sometimes
2018-12-12T19:39:04  <bryan_> Maybe I just have bad luck...I deleted and did vagrant up 3 times and it succeeded only on the last time
2018-12-12T19:39:52  <bryan_> Maybe coincidentally it was after I deleted node_modules after deleting the VM

2018-12-12T21:59:09  <jhernandez> maybe different versions of vbox, vagrant can make a difference

2018-12-12T23:21:55  <stegru> most (all?) of us only npm install inside the VM - it will probably make a difference, and the build tools on the VM are known to be good
2018-12-12T23:22:50  <stegru> and considering not many use a Windows host, we build and run in the vm
2018-12-12T23:25:56  <stegru> also, the unit tests will screw up your system if they fail half-way through - so keep inside the vm
