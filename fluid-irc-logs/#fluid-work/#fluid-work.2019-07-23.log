2019-07-23T09:00:17  <the-t-in-rtf> So, I'm trying to run the PSPChannel Tests, which are the last failing tests in my updated validation pull.
2019-07-23T09:00:30  <the-t-in-rtf> And I get the same failures now in both my pull and master.
2019-07-23T09:00:58  <the-t-in-rtf> Here's one example:
2019-07-23T09:00:59  <the-t-in-rtf> 10:59:24.370:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.config.development.local.mock.windows tests" Test name "PSP Channel - Basic user login/logout and client connect/disconnect tests" - Message: Unexpected failure in test case (see following log for more details): Assertion failure - check console for more details: Cannot look up name gpii.test.integration.actionHandlersAware.mockActionsHandlers.gpii.windows.rm to a function with registered
2019-07-23T09:00:59  <the-t-in-rtf> tMap - got defaults undefined
2019-07-23T09:01:12  <the-t-in-rtf> It should be gpii.test.integration.actionHandlersAware.mockActionsHandlers.rm
2019-07-23T09:02:32  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/397338314b1637f5d252e354f1640a5bcc5a0781/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L589
2019-07-23T09:03:09  *** Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2019-07-23T09:03:13  <the-t-in-rtf> or?
2019-07-23T09:03:25  <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I could use help understanding the mocks wiring, @Bosmon or anyone else.
2019-07-23T09:03:35  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - looks like this will have been affected by some recent work by javjarfer[m]
2019-07-23T09:03:58  <Bosmon> Could well just be the result of a bad merge?
2019-07-23T09:04:08  <the-t-in-rtf> well, right now I'm down to a very thin veneer of changes
2019-07-23T09:04:17  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't see anything in that area
2019-07-23T09:04:38  <the-t-in-rtf> I have been going through diffs of master for a while now
2019-07-23T09:04:42  <the-t-in-rtf> against master
2019-07-23T09:04:57  <the-t-in-rtf> I don't see any changes to configs, the mocks wiring, the failing test file itself.
2019-07-23T09:05:23  <Bosmon> I mean, the relevant mock is defined here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/9d1f8cfb7b14435b77bc2d9a9b9b06c5fa5d2c07/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L644
2019-07-23T09:05:45  <the-t-in-rtf> sure, but the namespace for the failing test lacks the "windows" bit
2019-07-23T09:06:19  <Bosmon> OK, in theory there is a portable "rm" mock here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/9d1f8cfb7b14435b77bc2d9a9b9b06c5fa5d2c07/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L590
2019-07-23T09:06:43  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but why is it looking for the other name?
2019-07-23T09:06:55  <Bosmon> Well there are two different implementations
2019-07-23T09:07:13  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, just to repeat, this can't be a bad merge
2019-07-23T09:07:15  <the-t-in-rtf> MASTER fails for me
2019-07-23T09:07:24  <Bosmon> Oh right
2019-07-23T09:07:33  <Bosmon> What, right now, with no changes?
2019-07-23T09:07:36  <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2019-07-23T09:07:47  <Bosmon> OK, let me try locally
2019-07-23T09:07:50  <the-t-in-rtf> node gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PSPChannelTests.js
2019-07-23T09:09:36  <the-t-in-rtf> I am spinning up a vagrant vm to confirm whether it passes there
2019-07-23T09:09:45  <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect not if I remember correctly from investigating late yesterday
2019-07-23T09:09:49  <Bosmon> I can confirm the isolated tests fails
2019-07-23T09:09:55  <the-t-in-rtf> whew, good
2019-07-23T09:10:05  <the-t-in-rtf> not a weird thing with unices
2019-07-23T09:10:21  <Bosmon> Setting a full test run now to see if that is the same
2019-07-23T09:11:21  <Bosmon> None of the merges in the last week seem like an obvious candidate ...
2019-07-23T09:11:26  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m], could you have a go yourself?
2019-07-23T09:12:54  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I wonder if it is just that the mock registry doesn't get properly populated for that test, but is somehow dirty resulting from a previous test?
2019-07-23T09:13:39  <the-t-in-rtf> npm test fails for me
2019-07-23T09:13:44  <the-t-in-rtf> in the order that the tests are in in master
2019-07-23T09:13:46  <Bosmon> Very very odd
2019-07-23T09:16:29  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: here I am, reading this
2019-07-23T09:18:09  <javjarfer[m]> This is really weird, so we have failing unit tests for universal locally?
2019-07-23T09:18:10  <javjarfer[m]> but not in CI?
2019-07-23T09:18:56  <javjarfer[m]> is this the case the-t-in-rtf ?
2019-07-23T09:19:11  <the-t-in-rtf> Well, they fail in my pull in CI
2019-07-23T09:19:13  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I suspect they even fail in CI
2019-07-23T09:19:14  <the-t-in-rtf> plainly
2019-07-23T09:19:22  <Bosmon> The question is, how did this stuff get into master, and when : P
2019-07-23T09:19:25  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-07-23T09:19:42  <the-t-in-rtf> I was thinking perhaps during the fog of war period where there were errors in provisioning VMs
2019-07-23T09:21:34  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: but haven't we had clean runs in CI since them?
2019-07-23T09:21:55  <the-t-in-rtf> let me dig up a recent success, just a minute
2019-07-23T09:23:55  <the-t-in-rtf> https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-tests/1869/
2019-07-23T09:24:00  <the-t-in-rtf> last success was five days ago
2019-07-23T09:24:24  <the-t-in-rtf> there's the pull: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/805
2019-07-23T09:25:01  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - but there has been no significant merge since then
2019-07-23T09:25:19  <the-t-in-rtf> right, some rug may have been pulled out from under us
2019-07-23T09:25:20  <Bosmon> This is the only change since that pull: https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/47cf91779d038b165314c0fb84af1c522840ec22
2019-07-23T09:25:42  <the-t-in-rtf> new VM, new unpinned dep from another project.
2019-07-23T09:25:42  <Bosmon> HOW could a rug have been pulled out from under us ...
2019-07-23T09:25:59  <the-t-in-rtf> that kind of rug
2019-07-23T09:26:22  <Bosmon> It would be astonishing, but certainly something has happened
2019-07-23T09:28:26  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm gonna kick off an other build of this pull: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/790
2019-07-23T09:28:40  <the-t-in-rtf> it passed before Cindy's was evaluated, but hasn't been checked in six days.
2019-07-23T09:28:49  <the-t-in-rtf> if it fails with no changes, that's another data point.
2019-07-23T09:29:24  <the-t-in-rtf> did you cut a dev release of universal after Cindy's merge?
2019-07-23T09:29:31  <the-t-in-rtf> we could look at the package-lock.json in the tar
2019-07-23T09:29:39  <the-t-in-rtf> and compare with what we have now
2019-07-23T09:30:21  <the-t-in-rtf> doesn't seem like it
2019-07-23T09:30:27  <the-t-in-rtf> last dev release is from July 3rd.
2019-07-23T09:31:11  <the-t-in-rtf> I guess even that would tell use somethiing

2019-07-23T09:35:42  <the-t-in-rtf> there are no dependency updates between the July 3rd release and current master.

2019-07-23T09:55:37  <the-t-in-rtf> The tests in stegru's pull passed cI: https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-tests/1879/
2019-07-23T09:57:09  <the-t-in-rtf> I'm going to see what happens if I merge his work with master, whether the tests start failing and what changes
2019-07-23T09:57:24  <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, merge upstream master with his work
2019-07-23T09:57:55  <the-t-in-rtf> uuuugh.
2019-07-23T09:58:02  <the-t-in-rtf> his branch fails on my machine.
2019-07-23T09:58:11  <the-t-in-rtf> how the mess is it working in CI?
2019-07-23T09:58:57  <the-t-in-rtf> the same psp channel tests fail even before I pulled in upstream master
2019-07-23T09:59:29  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I'm going to take a break, any other ideas are greatly welcomed
2019-07-23T10:06:20  <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, the fact that Steve's pull passes CI is just baffling, it can't be node or npm versions if mine fails and his doesn't.
2019-07-23T10:06:44  <Bosmon> Perhaps we have some kind of semi-stable race condition in the mock registry
2019-07-23T10:07:00  <Bosmon> Has anyone found a revision of master that actually works yet?
2019-07-23T10:07:21  <Bosmon> Oh yes, and I have something very odd to report
2019-07-23T10:07:28  <Bosmon> My complete run of all tests on current master actually passed
2019-07-23T10:07:31  <Bosmon> Locally
2019-07-23T10:07:44  <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I do think environment might be a factor, although it fails for me in vagrant as well
2019-07-23T10:07:49  <the-t-in-rtf> what happens if you run in vagrant?
2019-07-23T10:08:03  <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect you'll have the same failure, i.e. the tests pass with the windows mocks
2019-07-23T10:08:14  <the-t-in-rtf> but not in fedora
2019-07-23T10:11:21  <Bosmon> It's definitely "semi-stable" in some odd way, I just ran the isolated test 10 times and it failed each time
2019-07-23T10:11:39  <Bosmon> At least this is the good way round, it would be insufferable if the test passed in isolation but failed in a full run
2019-07-23T10:11:48  <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2019-07-23T10:12:56  <jhernandez> which tests are failing when running isolated?
2019-07-23T10:13:34  <Bosmon> jhernandez - node gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PSPChannelTests.js
2019-07-23T10:13:37  <Bosmon> Fails for me every time
2019-07-23T10:13:40  <Bosmon> And for the-t-in-rtf too
2019-07-23T10:13:55  <Bosmon> And he can also sometimes get the failure in a full test run, but I can't so far
2019-07-23T10:14:09  <jhernandez> ok
2019-07-23T10:14:42  <jhernandez> running a full pass now - if they pass, will run those to see if I get the same
2019-07-23T10:14:49  <jhernandez> just provisioned a fresh vm
2019-07-23T10:19:57  <jhernandez> All tests concluded: 2501/2501
2019-07-23T10:20:39  <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes, but they do!
2019-07-23T10:20:48  <Bosmon> It's just that one of them fails by itself ....
2019-07-23T10:25:09  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: oh great, then, it should be environmental true? so things needed are not loaded if the test is executed isolated
2019-07-23T10:25:25  <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - no, probably nothing so nice
2019-07-23T10:25:34  <Bosmon> Given the-t-in-rtf can sometimes see it fail in the big run too
2019-07-23T10:26:48  <jhernandez> hmmm
2019-07-23T10:27:04  <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: that's true
2019-07-23T10:27:05  <javjarfer[m]> so... timing related issue?
2019-07-23T10:27:50  <jhernandez> could it be that the recently added windows.rm mocks by javjarfer[m], that there is some config that is not loading them or using the right config/grade?
2019-07-23T10:34:21  <jhernandez> ie, the PSP tests are not bringing in https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/772/files#diff-69cd21adbc352c021c118e18b7ff3785R1798
2019-07-23T10:53:45  <javjarfer[m]> jhernandez: yes, I can see that in the logs too, also, that was included to the high-contrast solution, which is exercised in those tests
2019-07-23T10:54:54  <javjarfer[m]> I'm trying to compare to other tests that use the other mocking functions like "gpii.windows.updateLanguage", but I can't tell the difference aside that this tests appears to be launched with another context
2019-07-23T10:55:51  <javjarfer[m]> because they are run through
2019-07-23T10:55:52  <javjarfer[m]> "gpii.test.runCouchTestDefs"
2019-07-23T10:56:17  <javjarfer[m]> maybe the error is related to that

2019-07-23T15:14:01  <jhernandez> what we talked earlier during the call with the-t-in-rtf and Bosmon
2019-07-23T15:14:07  <jhernandez> about the failing PSP tests
2019-07-23T15:14:20  <Bosmon> jhernandez - I'm just reworking this stuff now
2019-07-23T15:14:25  <jhernandez> oh, okay okay
2019-07-23T15:14:28  <jhernandez> Bosmon: good to know
2019-07-23T15:14:32  <Bosmon> I think it is pretty clear that the mock device resporter stuff is completely hosed
2019-07-23T15:14:52  <jhernandez> I wasn't sure if you were just going to rework the depopulate
2019-07-23T15:15:00  <Bosmon> As far as I can understand the issue, we had two unrelated mock device reporters getting constructed, and it was just a race according to which one got its stuff registered
2019-07-23T15:15:07  <Bosmon> No, I think it needs more reworking than that
2019-07-23T15:15:30  <jhernandez> yes, and I guess that it also applies to the actionHandler reporter
2019-07-23T15:15:35  <jhernandez> which basically works the same way
2019-07-23T15:15:39  <jhernandez> ok ok
2019-07-23T15:15:52  <Bosmon> jhernandez - well the actionHandler reporter has its own problems
2019-07-23T15:16:03  <Bosmon> It is just massively overcomplicated and needs about half of it removed
2019-07-23T15:16:51  <jhernandez> ok, even worse :(
2019-07-23T15:19:57  <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: is there something wrong with the coverage reports in Infusion. I don't seem to be getting them any more.. I'm just seeing ones for fluid.js
2019-07-23T15:51:20  <gmoss> Justin_o: if you have time this afternoon, can we get together to talk about a couple of issues?
2019-07-23T15:52:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure, i should have time this afternoon.
2019-07-23T15:52:36  <gmoss> Justin_o: great, thanks

2019-07-23T16:56:00  <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, not that I'm aware of, but there is a kind of jumping off point if you update nyc.js, where a key option name has to be updated.
2019-07-23T16:56:25  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~kris@95.111.73.80> has joined #fluid-work
2019-07-23T16:57:43  <the-t-in-rtf> OK, it's just as I suspected.
2019-07-23T16:58:17  <the-t-in-rtf> change this variable name from "temp-directory" to "temp-dir" and you're good to go:
2019-07-23T16:58:18  <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/.nycrc#L14
2019-07-23T16:58:43  <the-t-in-rtf> they changed it to match the other "-dir" variable a while back
2019-07-23T17:02:55  <the-t-in-rtf> A key symptom of this little pathology is if .nyc_output shows up
2019-07-23T17:03:16  <the-t-in-rtf> that means nyc has stopped picking up the location of the coverage option, i.e. temp-dir

2019-07-23T18:11:31  <gmoss> Bosmon: Justin_o and I are exploring a potential kettle bug that I discovered yesterday evening. I noticed it while I was running a large number of browser tests while hosting kettle directly on my machine (i.e. not via the docker-compose instantiated node alpine container). I then isolated it to a particular simple and known-stable test sequence and was able to reproduce it consistently by refreshing two tabs again and
2019-07-23T18:11:31  <gmoss> again, after a second or two kettle crashes
2019-07-23T18:12:04  <gmoss> I haven't yet explored whether this was an issue before my SJRK-237 work
