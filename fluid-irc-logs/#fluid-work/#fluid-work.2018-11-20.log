2018-11-20T09:35:09  <Bosmon> Hey there georgitodorov - what was the disposition in the end of the electron upgrade work?
2018-11-20T09:35:21  <Bosmon> Did we decide that the slowness was caused by that or some other cause?
2018-11-20T09:36:25  <georgitodorov> Bosmon: We observed the slowness (even though in a milder form) in electron 1.8.8, as well
2018-11-20T09:37:21  <georgitodorov> Steve made some changes but I am not sure whether they got merged
2018-11-20T09:37:36  <georgitodorov> As I am still seeing this slowness
2018-11-20T09:38:00  <georgitodorov> And as a result, we haven't proceeded any further with the upgrade of Electron to 3.x
2018-11-20T09:40:00  <Bosmon> georgitodorov - ok, I wonder where stegru's changes are ...

2018-11-20T15:45:09  <Bosmon> cindyli - are you free to have a chat with Bryan in about an hour?
2018-11-20T15:45:13  <Bosmon> 12 your time?
2018-11-20T15:46:11  <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2018-11-20T15:46:11  <stegru> yes Bosmon.. in fact, I did nothing special to fix it. I think it was due to a sync write to the metrics log
2018-11-20T15:46:33  <Bosmon> stegru ?
2018-11-20T15:46:38  <Bosmon> And you got rid of the write?
2018-11-20T15:46:48  <stegru> ..which no longer exists, due to writing to the log service via tcp
2018-11-20T15:46:57  <Bosmon> ok
2018-11-20T15:46:58  <stegru> async
2018-11-20T15:47:25  <Bosmon> So as far as you are concerned that dandimitrov et al should be able to update to current universal master and the slowness should go away?
2018-11-20T15:47:48  <stegru> yes, although I didn't see the slowness before or after
2018-11-20T15:48:25  <stegru> or maybe I always saw the slowness
2018-11-20T15:49:20  <stegru> let's see how it goes, I believe the slowness was only ~500ms
2018-11-20T15:49:32  <dandimitrov> stegru: the menu, e.g. for the language setting was showing before the button in the QSS was colored

2018-11-20T15:49:59  <dandimitrov> with that async write everything seemed to be working normally
2018-11-20T15:50:06  <stegru> ah, great
2018-11-20T15:51:01  <stegru> by the way, I wasn't being lazy with the sync writing.. i beleive logs should be written synchronously because if there's a crash, you usually want to know what happened just before it happens :)
2018-11-20T15:51:56  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Wasn’t the Electron 3.x work blocked by the ffi problems… and the migration to ffi-napi?
2018-11-20T15:52:13  <Bosmon> stegru - I'm sure there's noone here who'd imagine you did it through laziness :)
2018-11-20T15:52:30  <stegru> i believe that is fixed.. right, jhernandez?
2018-11-20T15:52:32  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - as far as I remembered, the slowness was the only remnant problem - jhernandez?
2018-11-20T15:52:46  <jhernandez> right
2018-11-20T15:52:50  <stegru> there's actually an imperfection with the ffi-napi
2018-11-20T15:53:20  <jhernandez> stegru: an imperfection?
2018-11-20T15:53:20  <stegru> "ref" is still referenced by other things, rather than "ref-napi"
2018-11-20T15:53:44  <stegru> it's not important (everything still works)
2018-11-20T15:53:49  <jhernandez> yeah, that's somewhat incoherent for me as well
2018-11-20T15:54:04  <Bosmon> They're not identical?
2018-11-20T15:54:13  <stegru> maybe, maybe not
2018-11-20T15:54:16  <Bosmon> bah
2018-11-20T15:54:35  <jhernandez> when doing the move, I did some experiments and everything seemed to be working fine
2018-11-20T15:54:59  <jhernandez> I guess that ref-napi is actually being used only by ffi-napi itself
2018-11-20T15:55:30  <stegru> things cocked up for me when migrating the service code
2018-11-20T15:55:41  <jhernandez> heh, I see
2018-11-20T15:55:48  <stegru> the fix is: require("ref-struct-di")(ref)
2018-11-20T15:56:09  <jhernandez> wth?
2018-11-20T15:56:15  <stegru> but considering everything works as-is, who cares :)
2018-11-20T15:57:01  <stegru> "ref-struct" (and ref-array) are packages that let us define structures, but they use the old "ref", not "ref-napi"
2018-11-20T15:57:06  <Bosmon> "Note: The only difference to ref-struct is that this module takes its dependency on ref via dependency injection, so that it is easier to use e.g. ref-napi instead."
2018-11-20T15:57:24  <stegru> yes thanks
2018-11-20T15:57:36  <Bosmon> Total nuts
2018-11-20T15:57:42  <jhernandez> xDD
2018-11-20T15:58:07  <stegru> i think the objects that "ref" creates look the same as "ref-napi", so it doesn't probably matter

2018-11-20T16:03:57  <Bosmon> In practice this should be written at the settings handler level, but we currently don't support dynamic settings handlers
2018-11-20T16:04:08  <Bosmon> But the code should definitely be written in that module

2018-11-20T16:05:09  <jhernandez> yup
2018-11-20T16:05:57  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: hmm, do we have mechanism for listening for changes to the system language?
2018-11-20T16:06:21  <jhernandez> and I thought that we were going to use it on gpii-app to receive the language setting - but it's also true that we only get the values for UIO+, not the ones that are being applied to Windows
2018-11-20T16:06:24  <dandimitrov> I’m missing something
2018-11-20T16:06:51  <stegru> what about a list of languages in the site-config?
2018-11-20T16:06:52  <jhernandez> s/UIO+/gpii-app
2018-11-20T16:07:08  <Bosmon> stegru - he wants us to sense the languages which are installed
2018-11-20T16:07:32  <jhernandez> yup, we talked about that during our meeting yesterday
2018-11-20T16:07:48  <stegru> ok ok i'll see how
2018-11-20T16:07:54  <jhernandez> and that we only list the available (installed) languages
2018-11-20T16:08:10  <jhernandez> which makes sense
2018-11-20T16:10:37  <dandimitrov> Bosmon, jhernandez: so to listen for language change we should be using other means than the language setting that comes with the PSP Onboarding?
2018-11-20T16:10:55  <Bosmon> stegru - looks like this is just a registry handler plus process utility?
2018-11-20T16:11:09  <Bosmon> dandimitrov - I think the simplest method for now is for stegru to write you a small API
2018-11-20T16:11:33  <Bosmon> stegru - these two pieces, together with gpii.windows.updateLanguage should go into a new module in gpii-windows
2018-11-20T16:11:49  <stegru> yep
2018-11-20T16:11:55  <Bosmon> i) the thing which queries installed language packs, ii) allows people to subscribe for language changes
2018-11-20T16:12:20  <stegru> subscribing for language changes by what?
2018-11-20T16:12:27  <Bosmon> You said there is an API for ii), it's just that noone uses it?
2018-11-20T16:12:53  <Bosmon> stegru - Gregg wants the gpii-app to i18Nify itself that way in case anyone changes the language by some other means
2018-11-20T16:12:55  <stegru> there's no way to change the language without logging out/in

2018-11-20T16:13:49  <Bosmon> stegru - ok..... so it should be sufficient to just read the value from the session
2018-11-20T16:14:14  <Bosmon> Given if anyone else succeeded in changing the language setting, it would have to be readable from there
2018-11-20T16:14:17  <Bosmon> Ah!
2018-11-20T16:14:17  <stegru> yes, I think it's safe to assume the language doesn't change during a session (except by gpii)

2018-11-20T16:23:10  <jhernandez> so Bosmon, question - then, gpii-app will always follow the OS language? Or we still want it to be onboarded as any other app?

2018-11-20T16:23:37  <Bosmon> jhernandez - it will be onboarded for its own preferences
2018-11-20T16:24:11  <Bosmon> Oh yes
2018-11-20T16:24:24  <Bosmon> I forgot our plan to give it its own language setting
2018-11-20T16:24:40  <Bosmon> Well, Gregg has specifically requested that it follow the OS language, so we had better set that up
2018-11-20T16:24:50  <jhernandez> ok, and we follow OS language unless there is a different language setting for gpii-app
2018-11-20T16:25:07  <jhernandez> ?
2018-11-20T16:25:15  <stegru> do we have a jira for this?
2018-11-20T16:25:22  <Bosmon> Not yet
2018-11-20T16:25:30  <stegru> i'll do it
2018-11-20T16:25:37  <Bosmon> Very grateful

2018-11-20T16:48:46  <dandimitrov> Bosmon so in short, we'd be using the module that stergru would provide us with for listening for language changes as well as receiving currently available languages list
2018-11-20T16:48:58  <dandimitrov> And we won't be needing https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2653 ( Onboarding the GPII app ) in the context of i18n of the gpii-app?

2018-11-20T16:49:50  <Bosmon> Unless you end up implementing some gpii-app specific preferences which will be stored in the user's safe

2018-11-20T17:15:41  <jhernandez> stegru: FYI, the clean morphic folder is taking more than expected, testing is so slow ....
2018-11-20T17:16:24  <stegru> due to creating the installer?
2018-11-20T17:16:57  <jhernandez> creating, installing/uninstalling for testing
2018-11-20T17:18:24  <jhernandez> the point is that I can't get it to be removed "properly" through WIX
2018-11-20T17:18:55  <jhernandez> by adding that folder to the product and making windows installer to remove it at uninstall
2018-11-20T17:19:54  <jhernandez> but I have a few more bullets in the chamber
2018-11-20T17:21:11  <stegru> yeh, I don't think it likes to remove files it didn't create
2018-11-20T17:21:19  <stegru> I understand why
2018-11-20T17:22:52  <stegru> to speed things up, you could point it to a staging directory that only has a few files
2018-11-20T17:27:43  <jhernandez> yeah, thanks for the tip

2018-11-20T20:17:02  <stegru> hi colinclark, still have that question?
2018-11-20T20:27:15  <colinclark> stegru: I do!
2018-11-20T20:27:24  <colinclark> So the baseline data stuff...
2018-11-20T20:27:33  <colinclark> It's based on File Beat?
2018-11-20T20:27:38  <colinclark> and we have a separate installer for it?

2018-11-20T20:28:49  <stegru> no, it's included with gpii
2018-11-20T20:30:13  <stegru> internally, I've made an "installer module" which we just bundle with the installer.. but from the outside, it's inside the gpii .msi file
2018-11-20T20:31:02  <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/gpii-metrics/tree/master/filebeat-installer
2018-11-20T20:36:27  <stegru> oh no, i've answered the wrong question - the baseline data capture is a few gpii modules hacked together, and there's a separate installer
2018-11-20T20:38:21  <stegru> but that's going to change soon, so it will be the same installation, but there will be a switch for "normal gpii" or "data capture only"  via some configs that get swapped after installation
2018-11-20T20:39:34  <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/gpii-metrics/tree/master/gpii-standalone-metrics
2018-11-20T20:50:22  <colinclark> ok, thanks stegru
2018-11-20T20:50:32  <colinclark> I had heard about the "switch" today, and it all sort of puzzled me
2018-11-20T20:51:11  <colinclark> but I guess you've already got modules built into Morphic for collecting data, so maybe it's better just to install the whole thing but disable the Morphie parts of it
2018-11-20T20:53:40  <stegru> exactly, colinclark - at a minimum, just turn off the tray icon and user listeners
2018-11-20T20:53:50  <colinclark> ok
2018-11-20T20:53:57  <colinclark> does it seem to you that it will be a lot of work?
2018-11-20T20:54:08  <colinclark> to implement this switch?
2018-11-20T21:16:09  <stegru> sorry
2018-11-20T21:16:49  <stegru> I don't think it's a huge amount of work, but I'm not the best one to ask
2018-11-20T21:18:49  <avtar> Justin_o: ping
2018-11-20T21:19:48  <stegru> the actual switch could perhaps be a batch file that renames a directory or two, colinclark
2018-11-20T21:20:50  <colinclark> that seemed to be what Gregg's spec suggested
2018-11-20T21:20:53  <colinclark> a couple of batch files :)
2018-11-20T21:21:57  <stegru> we have a start up script, that could detect some setting and perform the switch
2018-11-20T21:22:16  <Justin_o> avtar: hello

2018-11-20T21:26:27  <Justin_o> avtar: ah okay...
2018-11-20T21:26:37  <Justin_o> yah i guess that is one of the new "features"
2018-11-20T21:26:46  <Justin_o> avtar: although i did update those recently as well
2018-11-20T21:27:20  <Justin_o> that is, there was an addition of new themes over the summer i think, and then they were updated some more in the fall

2018-11-20T21:35:57  <avtar> Justin_o: is there a jira that covers documentation for the new themes or should i create one?
2018-11-20T21:36:13  <avtar> referring to the list here https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UsingImagesInContrastModes.html#converting-images-with-transparency
2018-11-20T21:37:21  <Justin_o> avtar: not that i'm aware of, please do create one.
2018-11-20T21:37:35  <Justin_o> avtar: are your images SVGs or something else?
2018-11-20T21:38:08  <avtar> svgs and pngs
2018-11-20T21:39:31  <Justin_o> avtar:  if it's an SVG, depending on how you've added it, you could look at the technique I used in the prefs framework demo to change the colour of the logo. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/demos/prefsFramework/css/main.css#L125-L145
2018-11-20T21:40:18  <Justin_o> it may make sense to document that on the docs page too i guess.
2018-11-20T21:43:13  <avtar> Justin_o: is that svg being used inline?
2018-11-20T21:44:40  <avtar> nm found it https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/f977b0fa987c8ac8c8b66a55e65936bc33b46e09/demos/prefsFramework/index.html#L147
2018-11-20T21:47:48  <Justin_o> avtar: yes, there are other ways to include the SVGs and keep it stylable. You can see that on the research page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Research+SVG+Icons
2018-11-20T21:48:57  <avtar> thanks, i'll check that out
2018-11-20T21:49:07  <Justin_o> avtar: i'm heading out now, but i'll be around tomorrow if you have any other questions
