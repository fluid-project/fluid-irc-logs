2019-07-08T10:17:25  <jhernandez> are we triggering the deploy today?
2019-07-08T11:09:33  <jhernandez> okay, saw this (https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/438), we're not
2019-07-08T11:31:47  <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, that's right.
2019-07-08T11:32:07  <the-t-in-rtf> Antranig and I still need to work on a second fix to get back to comparable performance
2019-07-08T11:32:17  <the-t-in-rtf> we were 5x worse, now we're about half that.

2019-07-08T12:52:28  <kris_HA> Hi @Bosmon, is there something done which I can use to check if the user was used "auto key in"?

2019-07-08T13:25:59  <stegru> hi cindyli, in case you haven't noticed I've made some GPII-3988 related changes: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/798
2019-07-08T13:27:52  <cindyli> yes, stegru. your change reminds me that the user listener also calls performProximityTriggered(), which is not modified to accept "environmental" flag. I need to make some changes to the lifecycle manager for this function
2019-07-08T13:29:35  <stegru> oh yes cindyli - but, do you really think proximity type logins will be environmental ones?
2019-07-08T13:30:30  <stegru> jhernandez, have we decided on how defaultSettings.json is going to be updated? I have something to add to it
2019-07-08T13:30:50  <cindyli> yes, i do think the proximity type could be environmental login as long as it triggers logins
2019-07-08T13:30:54  <stegru> ok
2019-07-08T13:31:00  <cindyli> stegru: i left a comment on your pull request
2019-07-08T13:37:03  <cindyli> jhernandez: which universal branch is used for building the new installer?
2019-07-08T13:37:54  <cindyli> does it have the GPII-3988 work (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/795) merged in? this pull request has been merged into the master
2019-07-08T13:43:41  <stegru> 4004 is the one he's creating, cindyli
2019-07-08T13:44:33  <stegru> https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/GPII-4004
2019-07-08T13:47:13  <cindyli> thanks, stegru
2019-07-08T13:49:15  <cindyli> kris_HA: GPII-4004 doesn't yet have GPII-3988 work merged in. that's why you cannot see replayEnvironmentalLogin().
2019-07-08T13:50:26  <kris_HA> Thank you for the help cindyli
2019-07-08T13:51:01  <cindyli> np. this branch need to have the universal master merged in. probably you can give a try with your own copy of GPII-4004 + master

2019-07-08T14:14:17  <stegru> yes
2019-07-08T14:14:18  <jhernandez> or something else?

2019-07-08T14:14:22  <jhernandez> great
2019-07-08T14:14:38  <jhernandez> yes, we can put it in our GPII-4004 branch for now

2019-07-08T14:15:29  <jhernandez> cindyli1: yeah, I haven't updated my GPII-4004 branch with master yet
2019-07-08T14:15:32  <stegru> that's fine, but I mean there will be an old copy in the user's %appdata%/gpii - and that doesn't get overwritten
2019-07-08T14:15:57  <jhernandez> but will do as soon as I get a go from Steve - waiting for a few things at this moment
2019-07-08T14:16:39  <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, I guess that this brings back the old discussions about what to do with the %appdata/roaming/gpii/defaultSettings
2019-07-08T14:17:32  <clown> welcome back Justin_o!
2019-07-08T14:17:46  <stegru> oh, Justin_o :*
2019-07-08T14:18:32  <jhernandez> Justin_o: heey, welcome back!!
2019-07-08T14:20:00  <jhernandez> stegru: maybe ... shall we create yet another mini-installer that takes care of the defaultSettings? once the file is copied there, you need to manually delete it for universal to put the new file in there
2019-07-08T14:20:16  <jhernandez> idk, it's just an idea
2019-07-08T14:21:00  <stegru> I'm thinking of adding a "canUpdate: true" field to the file, so if the user does update it then they can set that flag
2019-07-08T14:21:14  <jhernandez> maybe, include the defaultSettings as part of the siteConfig installer, or create a mini app that allows you to update it
2019-07-08T14:21:25  <jhernandez> yeah, that'd also work
2019-07-08T14:22:07  <stegru> the thing about installers is, they're running as administrator, and not the person that owns %appdata%
2019-07-08T14:22:30  <stegru> eg, log in as root, then expect $HOME to be /home/javi
2019-07-08T14:22:32  <jhernandez> yeah, but we can include a script tht goes over all the User folderd
2019-07-08T14:22:46  <stegru> ah yes
2019-07-08T14:22:55  <jhernandez> *folders, and update the file

2019-07-08T14:23:45  <jhernandez> well, I guess that at some point we will need to think about adding some kind of UI for admins - dunno
2019-07-08T14:24:47  <jhernandez> ok, shall we bring this topic to the next arch meeting ?

2019-07-08T14:27:24  <stegru> isn't this what the cascading settings is meant to solve?
2019-07-08T14:28:41  *** kris_HA <kris_HA!~kris@95-43-108-75.ip.btc-net.bg> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
2019-07-08T14:29:08  <jhernandez> yeah ... but I don't see the cascading settings coming soon
2019-07-08T14:29:39  <stegru> yeh
2019-07-08T14:29:43  <jhernandez> that's why I thought about the installer-based approach
2019-07-08T14:30:08  <jhernandez> it's cheap for us - a bit more of work for sysadmins :P
2019-07-08T14:30:22  <stegru> do they even use this feature?
2019-07-08T14:30:31  <jhernandez> I mean, they're going to install the siteConfig installer anyway
2019-07-08T14:30:55  <jhernandez> which one? reset to std?
2019-07-08T14:31:04  <stegru> yes. reset
2019-07-08T14:31:09  <jhernandez> yes they do
2019-07-08T14:31:13  <stegru> i mena, the per-user config for reset
2019-07-08T14:31:30  <stegru> does anyone actually edit that file
2019-07-08T14:31:46  <jhernandez> nope, it's system-wide - and not, nobody edits that file manually

2019-07-08T14:32:01  <jhernandez> well, David might
2019-07-08T14:32:05  <stegru> %appdata%/gpii/defaultSettings.json isn't system wide
2019-07-08T14:32:09  <jhernandez> nope
2019-07-08T14:32:32  <stegru> what currently happens is gpii only updates that file if it doesn't exist
2019-07-08T14:32:37  <jhernandez> but it's copied from a "system-wide" path - the universal folder
2019-07-08T14:33:02  <jhernandez> exactly, it just copies the file if it doesn't exist
2019-07-08T14:33:10  <stegru> right
2019-07-08T14:33:44  <stegru> so if no one currently edits the per-user copy.. then what's the point in us having it?
2019-07-08T14:35:07  <jhernandez> well, we can find different use cases where it makes sense, and others where it doesn't at all
2019-07-08T14:35:43  <jhernandez> maybe cindyli remembers more than me why it has been implemented this way
2019-07-08T14:36:02  <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/DefaultSettingsLoader.js#L63-L63
2019-07-08T14:36:32  <stegru> to make things difficult for us :)
2019-07-08T14:36:43  <jhernandez> the purpose of that file is to allow gpii to know what the defaultSettings are in order for the system to reset to std
2019-07-08T14:36:58  <jhernandez> yeah, this file was supposed to be A THING that sysadmins were going to use
2019-07-08T14:37:33  <stegru> I think it would make sense to move the whole thing into siteConfig
2019-07-08T14:37:36  <cindyli> what's wrong with copying defaultSettings into the settings dir if there isn't such file in the settings dir?
2019-07-08T14:38:21  <stegru> nothing, until we want to add something to the default settings in an upgrade
2019-07-08T14:38:39  <jhernandez> cindyli: nothing, from time to time we revisit this topic because we need to add things to it
2019-07-08T14:38:51  <jhernandez> (as stegru's saying)
2019-07-08T14:38:56  <cindyli> ok. defaultSettings in the settings dir is meant for users to modify while the one in the universal is a generic base
2019-07-08T14:39:23  <jhernandez> cindyli: yeah, but the point is, which user? the sysadmins?
2019-07-08T14:39:59  <cindyli> i think it's more for owners of individual computers rather than the sysadmins
2019-07-08T14:40:09  <stegru> we could use either, depending on if it exists - let the "user" do the copying
2019-07-08T14:40:46  <stegru> file = exists(per-user) ? per-user : system;
2019-07-08T14:40:52  <jhernandez> yes, as I said earlier, the best thing to do depends on particular use cases
2019-07-08T14:41:03  <cindyli> that's true
2019-07-08T14:42:55  <jhernandez> the long term solution would be cascading settings :/
2019-07-08T14:43:35  <stegru> ok, you can tell gregg we'll have to wait until that's implemented ;)
2019-07-08T14:44:16  <jhernandez> my bet for short-term is, leave the current implementation as it is and deal with the defaultSettings from the siteConfig installer
2019-07-08T14:44:20  <stegru> ok, i can make a script into the siteconfig installer that just deletes the file
2019-07-08T14:44:22  <stegru> yeh
2019-07-08T14:44:57  <stegru> for file in c:\users\*\appData\Roaming\gpii\defaultSettings.json; do copy new-settings $file; done
2019-07-08T14:45:12  <stegru> that will be 20 lines of powershell ;)
2019-07-08T14:45:35  <jhernandez> well
2019-07-08T14:46:51  <jhernandez> we can add the defaultSettings file into the siteConfig installer, put it into the universal folder and just remove all the Users defaultSettings file - this will make the gpii to copy the file
2019-07-08T14:47:14  <jhernandez> we don't need to copy it into every user folder

2019-07-08T15:51:56  <cindyli> jhernandez: is the cloud you use for testing the new installer using your GPII-4004 branch, or just the client end? the reason I'm asking is, i noticed the work that enhances the security checks for NOVA requests is included in this branch. if this work is used in the cloud, NOVA client credentials won't be able to create new GPII keys and prefs safes until we migrate the Couchdb data to set these flags for the NOVA client credential
2019-07-08T15:51:56  <cindyli>  to true: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/data/dbData/clientCredentials.json#L60-L61
2019-07-08T15:55:02  <cindyli> this means, deploying the security checks to the cloud and migrating the data should happen at the same time so that NOVA computers can continue to auto key in with new client-generated GPII keys

2019-07-08T16:22:52  <jhernandez> this is in my todo list at some point this week
2019-07-08T16:23:52  <jhernandez> at this moment, my GPII-4004 uses production
2019-07-08T16:24:46  <jhernandez> so yeah, ideally, we should start trying to deploy what is currently in master within this week
2019-07-08T16:25:22  <jhernandez> not sure how realistic this is though
2019-07-08T16:25:26  <jhernandez> :)
2019-07-08T16:26:32  <jhernandez> but if we happen to NOT update the cloud, things will keep working - users at NOVA can keep creating keys and prefs (no need to update their client credentials)
