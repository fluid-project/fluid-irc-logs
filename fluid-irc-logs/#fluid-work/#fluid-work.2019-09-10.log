2019-09-10T15:07:37  <cindyli> Justin_o: when using "fluid.orator", there are 2 buttons displayed. the second one is for play/pause. can you remind me what the first one is for?
2019-09-10T15:08:11  <Justin_o> the first one isn't a button, it's the icon of the component
2019-09-10T15:08:37  <Justin_o> It'll probably make more sense in the future when there is more than just one button. at the moment it does admittedly seem a bit strange
2019-09-10T15:16:00  <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: planning is at 11:30 today
2019-09-10T15:16:01  <cindyli> Justin_o: curious about the design goal of having this icon displayed? as the way it's presented, my first thought is it's clickable with a feature

2019-09-10T15:22:57  <cindyli> Justin_o: looking at the tts design jpg, another use of it seems to indicate this component when nothing is detected on the page to read and the play/pause button is not shown

2019-09-10T15:53:01  <Bosmon> Justin_o - was just going through some byways to reconstruct our original work on the aux schema
2019-09-10T15:53:08  <Bosmon> You gave this helpful post to the mailing list: https://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2013-June/009115.html
2019-09-10T15:53:51  <Bosmon> Given this earlier chat with yzen seems to be innocent of the concept, it seems that the crucial design call must have taken place in the 6 weeks between these two points
2019-09-10T15:53:53  <Bosmon> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/fluid-tech+IRC+Logs-2013-05-02
2019-09-10T15:55:03  <Bosmon> Also we seem to have https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5066 from AC which I think touches on some of alanharnum 's concerns, and our conversation of yesterday

2019-09-10T16:20:09  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here's an old planning page in wiki https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Interface+Options+Iteration+Planning
2019-09-10T16:21:40  <Justin_o> sadly I probably was the one to write on the whiteboard so it isn't easy to read from the piture
2019-09-10T16:21:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it looks like you were going to be the one to "gingerize UIO"
2019-09-10T16:22:57  <Bosmon> Justin_o - pretty interesting
2019-09-10T16:23:07  <Bosmon> Hard to appreciate at this distance what might have been meant by that
2019-09-10T16:23:24  <Bosmon> I imagine, to the extent it was possible, it must already have been done
2019-09-10T16:23:37  <Bosmon> Since the world we have now is already immeasurably more ginger than the world of 2013 : P
2019-09-10T16:23:57  <Justin_o> Bosmon: haha yes, I wonder if it just meant using IoC or something like that
2019-09-10T16:24:05  <Bosmon> What's interesting is the history of https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4907
2019-09-10T16:24:12  <Bosmon> This was originally written up in Jan 2013
2019-09-10T16:24:16  <Justin_o> I also found these notes, but I think they were probably pulled from the e-mail you referenced. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+On+Primary+Schema+for+Preferences+Framework
2019-09-10T16:24:34  <Bosmon> But you will see that on June 20th, you edited it to make a "forward reference" to FLUID-5061 and the aux schema
2019-09-10T16:25:51  <Justin_o> Bosmon: it looks like we were only going to have a primary schema and then came up to having an auxiliary one as well
2019-09-10T16:26:59  <Bosmon> It seems based on the first draft that we dreamed that something might be cooked up by interacting with "rendering ants" via "demands blocks"
2019-09-10T16:27:27  <Bosmon> I guess I need to realign my mental picture that demands blocks had been removed in 2012, I guess this didn't really happen until late 2013
2019-09-10T16:29:04  <Bosmon> Your Jun 20th edit also removed the reference to demands blocks
2019-09-10T16:29:47  <Bosmon> And cindyli 's Jun 6th edit started to remove references to "ants"
2019-09-10T16:30:20  <Justin_o> I can't remember what the ants are exactly.. was the sort of an MVC separation?
2019-09-10T16:31:17  <Bosmon> The idea was that there were three "sides" to the reality of a preference - i) persistence, ii) presentation, iii) activity (later, "enactors")
2019-09-10T16:31:47  <Bosmon> And that one would be able to design these three sides more or less independently and then some 3rd or other party could come along and orchestrate them into the "preference"
2019-09-10T16:32:45  <Justin_o> ah okay
2019-09-10T16:32:49  <Justin_o> sort of what we have now
2019-09-10T16:33:36  <Bosmon> Yes, just minus the wacky terminology : P
2019-09-10T16:33:49  <Bosmon> It's interesting seeing what a multi-handed effort FLUID-4907 actually was
2019-09-10T16:34:10  <Justin_o> I think we did a lot of pairing back then too
2019-09-10T16:34:13  <Bosmon> Looking the commits I see significant contributions from you, cindyli and yzen
2019-09-10T16:34:22  <Justin_o> yes that sounds about right
2019-09-10T16:34:44  <Bosmon> Sort of more or less equally over about 2 months
2019-09-10T16:35:11  <Bosmon> I guess our total lack of documentation standards meant that we worked a little more quickly in those days : P
2019-09-10T16:35:27  <Bosmon> But then also the fact that we could spare 3 of our core developers to work on a single feature for 2 months ....
2019-09-10T16:36:58  <Bosmon> Quite amazing, look at this, the first commit from cindyli: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/d81dc977720671ece7c0c384992a42e0b034218f

2019-09-10T16:37:26  <Bosmon> This original incarnation of the aux schema appeared to encode for enactors too
2019-09-10T16:37:55  <Bosmon> What's odd is that this most problematic aspect of the aux schema, the special "@" reference syntax, appears to have been built in from the very start : P

2019-09-10T16:38:39  <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, the schema handles both panels and enactors. And you can pull out a grade that just has the panels or the enactors, in case you want to use the separately
2019-09-10T16:38:51  <Justin_o> well, hmm.. maybe not just the panels.. maybe it was just enactors.
2019-09-10T16:39:14  <Bosmon> And the very next commit was from you, implementing "preference maps"
2019-09-10T16:39:15  <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/075dbeeda321b0874d05f3b80bf5ddd82ec2356d
2019-09-10T16:39:35  <Justin_o> we did have some docs written on the wiki, but those were probably in the old docs space that's gone now that we have the docs site. I'll see if there is an archive in the wiki
2019-09-10T16:41:07  <Bosmon> By the time of this commit on July 23rd, AuxBuilder was already pretty much as nasty as it is today: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/8f6109331a75a0f37402e8799fa9016418ea2d2c
2019-09-10T16:41:58  <Bosmon> It took us only 2 weeks to create this monstrosity that it might take us years to dismantle : P
2019-09-10T16:43:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: at least it was done quickly :)
2019-09-10T16:43:53  <Justin_o> Bosmon: here are the docs https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Preferences+Framework
2019-09-10T16:43:58  <Bosmon> It then had some pretty light review on Aug 2nd and then was pretty rapidly pushed in - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/371
2019-09-10T16:44:14  <Bosmon> Yes, in this case Rome was built in a day and then took centuries to burn down :)
2019-09-10T16:44:43  <Justin_o> lol

2019-09-10T20:03:06  <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/data/dbData/clientCredentials.json#L46-L47
2019-09-10T20:04:49  <cindyli> javi created some test client credentials with the NOVA privilege on the staging and production servers. kavya should have them as well
2019-09-10T20:05:22  <cindyli> i don't have any of them
2019-09-10T20:07:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: awesome, I'll take a look shortly and will merge it in if I don't see any issues
2019-09-10T20:07:52  <gmoss> in fact, even if I do, I may just merge it in and work on it myself, since I know your day is coming to a close
2019-09-10T20:09:35  <sgithens> cindyli: oh ok, cool. So a fresh checkout of master wouldn't be operating on those credentials
2019-09-10T20:09:44  <sgithens> I'm not even sure how to configure that or set it up
2019-09-10T20:09:59  <sgithens> We probably don't have any instrustions do we?
2019-09-10T20:10:29  <sgithens> If we wanted to configure a local gpii-app to point to staging, or to set up a personal dev cluster and local gpii-app
2019-09-10T20:10:51  <cindyli> let me think...
2019-09-10T20:11:23  <Justin_o> gmoss: yah, I only have about 20 min left.. but I can fix something till then
2019-09-10T20:11:42  <Justin_o> If there is anything left in the morning, I'll try to pick stuff up then too
2019-09-10T20:12:49  <sgithens> cindyli: Hmm, ok, I'll try and set them up, and then add them as instructions in the capture tool branch for testing
2019-09-10T20:13:39  <cindyli> that's great, sgithens. the universal should have instructions of how to use different types of client credentials too
2019-09-10T20:13:50  <sgithens> So, I think I see that those client credentials just need to get posted to couch which makes sense, but I'm not sure what I need to do to gpii-app
2019-09-10T20:13:53  <sgithens> ah
2019-09-10T20:14:55  <cindyli> sgithens: checking my gpii-app doc. one sec
2019-09-10T20:17:24  <cindyli> sgithens: are you using windows auto key-in version of Morphic? did you use the "secret blower" installer to install the client credential file?
2019-09-10T20:18:36  <sgithens> cindyli: I have not done any extra stuff. Previously I just added another key item in `menu.js` with the snapsets, but that was a fresh UUID fro m`uuidgen` and then keyed in with that

2019-09-10T20:22:27  <cindyli> sgithens: the client credential should be stored in a file on your computer. are you using the VM started from the gpii-app directory for testing?
2019-09-10T20:24:46  <sgithens> cindyli: Yes

2019-09-10T20:26:52  <sgithens> cindyli: So, is it just a JSON file we have somewhere in the gpii-app source?
2019-09-10T20:28:04  <cindyli> very possible. Mophic installer will copy that file to somewhere else but using gpii-app source code probably still reads the public client credential gpii-app/node_modules/gpii-universal/testData/clientCredentials/pilot.json
2019-09-10T20:28:51  <cindyli> sgithens: but anyway you will still need a NOVA-privileged client credential from javi, which has already been put into the CouchDB on the staging
2019-09-10T20:29:14  <cindyli> to replace whatever in that json file
2019-09-10T20:29:36  <cindyli> but javi should know better about where that json file is
2019-09-10T20:29:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: i was able to break it :O would you like to see?
2019-09-10T20:30:01  <Justin_o> sure
2019-09-10T20:30:09  <sgithens> cindyli: Cool, I'll touch base with him
2019-09-10T20:31:37  <cindyli> great

2019-09-10T20:49:55  <Justin_o> gmoss: what do you think about preventing horizontal resizing of the textareas
2019-09-10T20:50:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: I wouldn't have assumed that was possible, but I think if someone wants to make that area wider, it might be best to allow that. is that limiting your fix, currently?
2019-09-10T20:51:08  <gmoss> it would definitely keep the layout from "breaking"
2019-09-10T20:51:35  <gmoss> i mean it doesn't break, currently, but it does disrupt the boundaries we've added on the left and right
2019-09-10T20:51:42  <Justin_o> possibly.. but just checking.. I think we should definitely put a min-width though
2019-09-10T20:54:01  <Justin_o> not sure what size, but I don't think we should let things get shrunk too far down
