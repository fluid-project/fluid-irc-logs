2019-08-27T17:02:07  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm looking at your review for SJRK-263 and I have a quick question
2019-08-27T17:02:11  <gmoss> do you have a minute?
2019-08-27T17:04:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2019-08-27T17:05:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/37#pullrequestreview-279584185 here you suggest using fluid.isValue, which is great and I've made that change, but I'm also mulling over combining it with a call to fluid.isPrimitive. I can't think of a case where passing in an object or array would make sense, but I also wonder whether this checking should happen here or whether it would be best to
2019-08-27T17:05:42  <gmoss> just let the transform fail here instead of silently ignoring the input and defaulting to true. what do you think?
2019-08-27T17:07:38  <Justin_o> gmoss: just reminding myself about this code

2019-08-27T17:11:37  <Justin_o> gmoss: what is the purpose of the check. from what I can tell you want to say if stringOnly isn't specified default to true, otherwise use the value of stringOnly for the check?
2019-08-27T17:12:59  <gmoss> Justin_o: the purpose is to have the option default to true if it isn't provided, much like the delimiter and path options, but if I put `transformSpec.stringOnly || true` then it's always going to be true, hence this line
2019-08-27T17:13:21  <gmoss> Justin_o: so it's as you've described it
2019-08-27T17:14:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: are you able to define this flag in the opposite case... I'm not sure what that would be called though. But if you could, it would simplify this line and also the conditional below so you wouldn't have to negate it.
2019-08-27T17:15:26  <gmoss> Justin_o: not a bad idea.. I'll think about what an appropriate name might be for this and for `trim`
2019-08-27T17:15:59  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay.. also in your comment above the function, you should probably indicate what the default value is.
2019-08-27T17:16:19  <gmoss> Justin_o: very true. I'll make that change
2019-08-27T17:17:01  <gmoss> in the case of `trim`, it's going to be tricky to come up with something that means exactly and only the opposite of trim haha... "trailingSpacesAllowed"? seems clunky
2019-08-27T17:17:06  <gmoss> trim is so tidy

2019-08-27T17:17:54  <gmoss> and happens to be the exact name of the function called
2019-08-27T17:18:32  <Justin_o> gmoss: you could have it default to false
2019-08-27T17:19:23  <Justin_o> gmoss: I guess you could also have a default transformSpec object that you merge the passed in transformSpec ontop of. Then if the value isn't present, it will not modify it.
2019-08-27T17:19:53  <Justin_o> In that case I believe null would still be treated as false, so would depend on if you want that or not.
2019-08-27T17:20:25  <Justin_o> it would be like have options for the function
2019-08-27T17:21:44  <Justin_o> that might be overkill if you just have one option though
2019-08-27T17:24:54  <gmoss> Justin_o: hmm setting it up in the grade and merging is not the worst idea, and it would avoid me having to do the checks and defaulting in the transform function proper... I wonder if there's any prior art in Infusion
2019-08-27T17:24:59  <gmoss> (am checking)

2019-08-27T17:32:54  <gmoss> Justin_o: from what I can see, most of the built-in transform functions do the defaulting when the value is used, not before
2019-08-27T17:33:02  <gmoss> I can reorganize things and leave the check for then
2019-08-27T17:37:36  <gmoss> Justin_o: if only Infusion had been written in a strongly-typed language :P
2019-08-27T17:37:46  <gmoss> (somewhat thankful it isn't)
2019-08-27T17:37:51  <Justin_o> haha
2019-08-27T17:38:19  <Justin_o> I think for stringToArray waiting to sort out the defaults till after you check input makes sense, because you may bail before they are used.
2019-08-27T17:38:50  <Justin_o> for arrayToString you have a fluid.each call, so you'll probably want to sort it out before that, so that you aren't doing the same operation for each iteration
