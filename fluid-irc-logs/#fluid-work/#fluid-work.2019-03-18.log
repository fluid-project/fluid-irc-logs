2019-03-18T12:01:26  <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, I am planning to add a schema-generation bit to postinstall in universal
2019-03-18T12:01:41  <the-t-in-rtf> any objections to my splitting that up into named commands?
2019-03-18T12:01:58  <the-t-in-rtf> it's four && blocks deep at the moment
2019-03-18T12:03:32  <the-t-in-rtf> so it'd end up being npm run postinstall:saneName1 && npm run postinstall:saneName2, etc

2019-03-18T12:15:59  <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - named commands is good, also we should just start building up a tiny library of "grunt replacement tasks" for example those that serialise the execution of a bunch of scripts
2019-03-18T12:17:42  <the-t-in-rtf> these would be npm scripts, or?
2019-03-18T12:17:52  <the-t-in-rtf> javascript?

2019-03-18T12:29:32  <the-t-in-rtf> something that we can call from the rollup that parses the package and runs the namespaced sub-scripts?
2019-03-18T12:30:17  <the-t-in-rtf> so mystep: "node path/to/magic.js" ensures that mystep:one, mystep:two, etc are all run?
2019-03-18T12:34:49  <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps "node path/to/magic.js mystep" depending on whether npm exposes any information about the script name

2019-03-18T15:56:56  <jhernand_> and now we are going to start using the gpii-app production config as expected :P

2019-03-18T17:00:20  <sgithens> javjarfer[m]: No worries, does the demo version from Microsoft suffice for testing? Is all the LearningTools work stable and in master now?
2019-03-18T17:00:45  <sgithens> Just curious because I was working with Amarja last week to edit LearningTools options in teh PPT
2019-03-18T17:01:00  <sgithens> and we werent' sure if it was correctly working or supported yet
2019-03-18T17:01:38  <javjarfer[m]> sgithens: I'm afraid it's not, the only way to use all the features from LearningTools is to have the Office 365 subscription
2019-03-18T17:02:27  <javjarfer[m]> that way you can use the learning tools from Microsoft office, for the LearningTools from OneNote 2016, you will need to install OneNote 2016 + the LearningTools plugin
2019-03-18T17:02:52  <javjarfer[m]> all learning tools are in master now, and all they should work
2019-03-18T17:05:47  <sgithens> javjarfer[m]: so even if you have the office 365 subscription, just specifically for OneNote 2016, you have to install the LearningTools separately?
2019-03-18T17:06:18  <sgithens> Do we have the install requirements for the LearningTools work documented anywhere?
2019-03-18T17:06:40  <sgithens> and maybe just what they are expected to do on key-in and key-out?
2019-03-18T17:11:47  <javjarfer[m]> sgithens: pref sets for users liam.json5 and lorie.json5 that can be found in "testData\universal" have markdown files with their same names detailing what's needed for testing the feature and how to verify that the settings have been set.
2019-03-18T17:12:07  <sgithens> javjarfer[m]: Awesome, thanks!

2019-03-18T17:14:00  <javjarfer[m]> sgithens: yw! I agree we should talk in a unified place for placing all this info, for products like this there is a google drive folder, that should be updated
2019-03-18T17:14:42  <sgithens> I don't completely mind it being in markdown in github.
2019-03-18T17:15:07  <sgithens> You know, it seems like the logical place for the installation requirements would be as comments in the solutions entry
2019-03-18T17:15:12  <sgithens> since it's all json5 now
2019-03-18T17:15:28  <sgithens> and maybe a companion in the docs folder or something
2019-03-18T17:17:04  <javjarfer[m]> sgithens: I agree with that, having something like docs folder in Github when we split the solution registry into multiple solutions, you know, like one doc folder per solution, written in markdown, will be really nice

2019-03-18T22:37:44  <sgithens> Does everyone's copy of Morphic share this same onedrive folder when you click Quick Folders? Or is automatically provisioned with some free version of onedrive the first time you click on it?
2019-03-18T22:39:01  <stegru> I think it's the same for everyone, sgithens
2019-03-18T22:39:20  <sgithens> kind of a bizarre feature
2019-03-18T22:39:44  <stegru> I don't think that's the final implementation
2019-03-18T22:48:34  <jhernand_> right, not the final implementation
2019-03-18T22:49:13  <jhernand_> sgithens: FYI, the last installer uses a shared google drive folder
2019-03-18T22:49:45  <jhernand_> onedrive's one wasn't working as expected
2019-03-18T23:06:13  <stegru> I don't think that's the final implementation
2019-03-18T23:06:20  <stegru> oh sorry
