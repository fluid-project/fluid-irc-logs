2019-09-25T13:25:53  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm reviewing the PR to add an .editorconfig file to Infusion and am wondering how you feel about this setting. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/961/files#diff-1e70daafb475c0ce3fef7d2728279182R6
2019-09-25T13:28:20  <Bosmon> Justin_o - the setting is fine, although I guess it doesn't matter much if we can't enforce it with linting for now
2019-09-25T13:28:42  <Justin_o> Bosmon: we can https://eslint.org/docs/rules/linebreak-style
2019-09-25T13:29:05  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I'm just not sure how disruptive it is
2019-09-25T13:30:08  <Justin_o> Bosmon: for example for those that use this
2019-09-25T13:30:08  <Justin_o> git config --global core.autocrlf true

2019-09-25T13:44:58  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I believe that was the standard we adopted perhaps 9 years ago : P
2019-09-25T13:45:06  <Bosmon> It's possible that some DOS-style files got committed accidentally
2019-09-25T13:46:02  <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you mean the LF line ending, or setting core.autocrlf to true
2019-09-25T13:46:38  <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean the line ending, but I could be mistaken
2019-09-25T13:46:40  <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess there's potentially a mismatch in that the repo may still be in LF but the coding environment could be using crlf
2019-09-25T13:46:58  <Bosmon> I have a script which automatically sets any new files I commit to LF
2019-09-25T13:46:59  <Justin_o> Bosmon: that's what core.autocrlf is trying to do for example
2019-09-25T13:47:14  <Bosmon> And I believe I am one of the few or perhaps only contributor working on Windows : p
2019-09-25T13:48:11  <Justin_o> Bosmon: possible :) I just don't want to discourage others from contributing as well
2019-09-25T13:48:46  <Justin_o> Bosmon: and how do you feel about adding the line ending check to linting.. that doesn't have to be part of this though
2019-09-25T13:49:01  <Bosmon> I don't mind it

2019-09-25T18:26:52  <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding the new API used by gpii-app to read setting values described in https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3958, the API for applying settings looks like:
2019-09-25T18:26:54  <cindyli> {
2019-09-25T18:26:54  <cindyli>     "path": ["settingControls", "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/common/DPIScale", "value"],
2019-09-25T18:26:54  <cindyli>     "type": "ADD",

2019-09-25T18:26:54  <cindyli> }
2019-09-25T18:27:19  <cindyli> so, shall the read API uses the similar format like:
2019-09-25T18:27:23  <cindyli> {
2019-09-25T18:27:23  <cindyli>     "path": ["settingControls", "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/common/DPIScale"],

2019-09-25T19:36:51  <Bosmon> cindyli - I didn't realise that this wasn't already the current API ....
2019-09-25T19:38:06  <cindyli> Bosmon: not yet. but i can change it to.
2019-09-25T19:38:26  <cindyli> afterwards, gpii-app needs a bit adjustment to use the changed API
2019-09-25T19:38:49  <Bosmon> cindyli - how is the current API different?
2019-09-25T19:39:05  <cindyli> gpii-app sends in this format:
2019-09-25T19:39:11  <cindyli> {
2019-09-25T19:39:11  <cindyli>     "path": ["settingControls", "http://registry\\.gpii\\.net/common/DPIScale", "value"],
2019-09-25T19:39:11  <cindyli>     "type": "ADD",
2019-09-25T19:39:11  <cindyli>     "value": 1.75
2019-09-25T19:39:11  <cindyli> }
2019-09-25T19:39:35  <Bosmon> cindyli - ah, shame - I guess it was influenced by the then-contemporary format for the Nexus API...
2019-09-25T19:40:41  <cindyli> Bosmon: ya, "Nexus" is mentioned in the code too - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PSPChannel.js#L333
2019-09-25T19:41:05  <cindyli> that's another thing i'd like to check with you before changing the API

2019-09-25T19:42:26  <Bosmon> That is the other thing?
2019-09-25T19:42:29  <Bosmon> What
2019-09-25T19:42:56  <cindyli> to know if the change would break Nwxus
2019-09-25T19:42:58  <cindyli> Nexus
2019-09-25T19:43:17  <Bosmon> Well, we're not interoperating with the Nexus here : P
2019-09-25T19:43:24  <Bosmon> We had always planned to fix the Nexus API anyway
2019-09-25T19:44:14  <cindyli> but seems Nexus also uses this API and there's some hacks for accommodating incoming messages from Nexus
2019-09-25T19:44:42  <Bosmon> cindyli - the API is just "inspired" by the Nexus, there is no direct connection
2019-09-25T19:44:50  <cindyli> ah ah i se
2019-09-25T19:44:50  <Bosmon> In any case the Nexus itself is just "a" Nexus anyway : P
2019-09-25T19:44:51  <cindyli> e
2019-09-25T19:45:01  <cindyli> ok. great to know
2019-09-25T19:45:33  <cindyli> Bosmon: so shall I go ahead to change the current API?
2019-09-25T19:45:59  <Bosmon> cindyli - please do!
2019-09-25T19:46:19  <cindyli> ok, and i will remove these 2 line of comments - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PSPChannel.js#L332-L333 ;)
2019-09-25T19:46:26  <cindyli> so confusing
2019-09-25T19:46:57  <Bosmon> Well, we should add these comments as a JIRA against the Nexus :)
2019-09-25T19:47:04  <Bosmon> So it looks like we *do* have typed messages already though
2019-09-25T19:47:16  <cindyli> good idea
2019-09-25T19:47:29  <Bosmon> cindyli - are you saying that the issue is we only have typed messages in one direction?
2019-09-25T19:47:44  <cindyli> yes
2019-09-25T19:47:52  <Bosmon> OK cool
2019-09-25T19:47:55  <Bosmon> We should make it consistent then
2019-09-25T19:48:08  <cindyli> ok
2019-09-25T19:48:14  <Bosmon> In the old days we used to be nervous about making any changes in the area of the app, but the HA team are very responsive : P
2019-09-25T19:49:03  <cindyli> awesome

2019-09-25T19:56:52  <cindyli> hi simonjb, where's the bug tracker for Nexus project? I don't find it on issues.fluidproject.org or issues.gpii.net
2019-09-25T19:58:45  <Bosmon> cindyli - it's all in the GPII one
2019-09-25T19:58:48  <Bosmon> Dozens of issues there..
2019-09-25T19:58:56  <Bosmon> e.g. https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2207
2019-09-25T19:59:33  <cindyli> ok, "nexus" is created as a gpii component
2019-09-25T19:59:40  <cindyli> cool. thanks
2019-09-25T20:00:40  <simonjb> cindyli: what Bosmon said :)

2019-09-25T21:46:13  <Justin_o> gmoss: did the changes we made to the JIRA workflow for SJRK cause any issues?
2019-09-25T21:47:10  <gmoss> Justin_o: I haven't noticed any yet, but I haven't gone through and checked everything
2019-09-25T21:47:17  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay
2019-09-25T21:47:29  <Justin_o> hopefully everything is okay
2019-09-25T21:47:54  <gmoss> we'll see :)
2019-09-25T21:48:18  <gmoss> I think SJRK-268 PR is a good test case. it should close SJRK-268, but I've also mentioned several other Jiras in the comments
2019-09-25T21:48:40  <gmoss> other good cases would be commit messages containing other Jira names
2019-09-25T21:48:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: yah, that could affect them.. I'm not sure.
2019-09-25T21:51:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-workflow-triggers-776636696.html
2019-09-25T21:51:44  <Justin_o> I guess you can check those other issues to see if they were transitioned to the pull request status
2019-09-25T21:51:53  <Justin_o> although I don't know if there is a trigger setup for that actually.
2019-09-25T21:51:59  <Justin_o> we might need to add one of those too
2019-09-25T21:57:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: what is the URL for the live instance of the cities story editor?
2019-09-25T21:57:57  <gmoss> https://stories.cities.inclusivedesign.ca/
2019-09-25T21:58:02  <gmoss> the editing has been disabled, though
2019-09-25T21:58:09  <gmoss> it's just a static collection of stories, now
2019-09-25T21:59:11  <gmoss> Justin_o: I have been seeing various Jiras transition to Pull Request once one is opened, the issue was only that it didn't change once said PR was merged or closed
2019-09-25T21:59:26  <gmoss> *it might have been transitioning on PR's being closed, actually
2019-09-25T21:59:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: I see, in the branch it is just a collection of stories now
2019-09-25T22:00:16  <Justin_o> gmoss: regarding JIRA transitions, maybe it was just the one trigger that was missing before then
2019-09-25T22:01:12  <gmoss> Justin_o: indeed. Once SJRK-268 is merged in, I'll request that floe-dev is merged into cities-production so that those updates go live too
2019-09-25T22:01:25  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay
2019-09-25T22:01:46  <gmoss> Justin_o: and yeah maybe! I guess we'll see how the Jira things go with the PR :)

2019-09-25T22:25:28  <Justin_o> gmoss:  I merged https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/pull/39  I didn't manually close the JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-268 so that we can see if the trigger worked.
2019-09-25T22:50:22  <gmoss> Justin_o: thanks! Looks like it worked :) I'll check the other issues later this evening
