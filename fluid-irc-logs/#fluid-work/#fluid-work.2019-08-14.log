2019-08-14T18:30:22  <sgithens> cindyli: Right now, for the endpoints that the QSS uses to save settings/prefs, does it always replace them all or merge them all, or is there a URL param that allows you to select if you want to replace/merge?
2019-08-14T18:34:55  <cindyli> it's always a merge, sgithens
2019-08-14T18:36:43  <sgithens> cindyli: Cool thanks
2019-08-14T18:36:57  <gmoss> cindyli: here's the event I was trying to remind myself of, the editor's story model is only updated when this event is called (hitting "next", "preview" or when changing language), or when one of the three metadata fields is changed: https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/src/ui/base-page-storyEdit.js#L35-L38
2019-08-14T18:37:18  <gmoss> hoepfully that's helpful
2019-08-14T18:38:34  <cindyli> sgithens: there's a merge parameter accepted by the prefs server API but flow manager API doesn't expose this flag
2019-08-14T18:38:36  <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/PreferencesServer.md#put-preferencesgpiikeymergemergeviewview
2019-08-14T18:39:16  <cindyli> flow manager API always uses "merge=true"
2019-08-14T18:39:27  <sgithens> cindyli: Aha, good to know
2019-08-14T18:39:38  <sgithens> cindyli: Also,
2019-08-14T18:39:38  *** simonjb <simonjb!~simonjb@198.178.118.18> has quit IRC ()
2019-08-14T18:39:52  <cindyli> thanks, gmoss
2019-08-14T18:39:55  <sgithens> with the current API's in the flowmanager, is there anyway for a keyed in user to get a list of all their preference sets?
2019-08-14T18:40:20  <sgithens> I know we don't really support anything other than gpii-default for most operations
2019-08-14T18:41:37  <sgithens> I'm trying to determine if there is anything a keyed-in user of the capture tool could do, other than just save settings to a prefs set. If they have perms to see an existing list of prefssets, so they could choose an existing one to write to
2019-08-14T18:42:08  <cindyli> sgithens: /settings GET does return a list of preferences that are filtered from gpii-default prefs set based on installed solutions sent in with the GET request. there isn't a way to get a list of all via flowmanager API
2019-08-14T18:42:47  <sgithens> cindyli: Ok, so it defaults to gpii-default and there isn't an option (yet) to read a different one
2019-08-14T18:45:21  <cindyli> sgithens: i believe there is a way to request a different pref set as this has already been supported by PSPâ€¦
2019-08-14T18:45:47  <cindyli> looking into pspChannel
2019-08-14T18:47:19  <cindyli> sgithens: by sending a model change to pspChannel.model.activeContextName
2019-08-14T18:47:38  <sgithens> aha
2019-08-14T18:47:46  <cindyli> i don't think there is a flow manager API for it
2019-08-14T18:47:57  <sgithens> yeah, I've used that in the capture tool to save to a different prefset
2019-08-14T18:48:05  <cindyli> ok
2019-08-14T18:48:09  <sgithens> but was wondering if I could get a list of them for display
2019-08-14T18:48:20  <sgithens> otherwise the user has to just type it in and hopefully get it right
2019-08-14T18:48:41  <cindyli> we could create a new api ;)
2019-08-14T18:49:03  <sgithens> cindyli: Definately, was just trying to make the demo as complete as I could get it before that...
2019-08-14T18:49:22  <sgithens> since UX is still a little indecisive on how the final pages of the wizard will work
2019-08-14T18:49:50  <sgithens> also, I wasn't sure if that was an operation that would ever be permitted with just "keyed in" access and not a full username/password
2019-08-14T18:50:09  <sgithens> I'm still unsure of exactly what our protocol of acceptable future interations with just a key-in is
2019-08-14T18:50:20  <sgithens> do we have a list, or is it still changing?
2019-08-14T18:52:08  <cindyli> sgithens: i'm not aware of such a list
2019-08-14T18:53:54  <cindyli> if the capture tool is running as a part of Morphic instead a central website that has special priviledge to talk to the prefs server, with APIs we have with pspchannel and flow manager, i don't think you could read a list of pref sets. also as you said and i totally agree, verifying the permission to access such information is important

2019-08-14T19:50:04  <Justin_o> alanharnum, gmoss: what do you think of this idea for the Infusion dist directory. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6359?focusedCommentId=40670&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-40670
2019-08-14T20:13:47  <cindyli> gmoss: the problem you have with SJRK-263 is because you didn't filter out the empty blocks from storyEdit.story.model at saving. the content being saved into the database is still with empty blocks - https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/stories-floe-dev/src/ui/base-page-storyEdit.js#L268
2019-08-14T20:15:08  <cindyli> your current model relay that removes empty blocks only applies to the preview page, so on the preview, those empty blocks are gone, but not from the save
