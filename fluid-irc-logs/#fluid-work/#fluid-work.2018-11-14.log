2018-11-14T08:44:27  <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Were you referring to a build such as this one on Monday - https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-tests/420/ :?
2018-11-14T08:44:32  <dandimitrov> I’ve noticed them before but it looked like this happens only when you start a new build with another build still running. In our cases there’s always a build that has hanged (meaning that it would stay running for an hour) as the “still running” one but not always.

2018-11-14T12:30:31  <dandimitrov> I haven't investigated that any further as it seemed like a somehow expected behaviour but we should ask jhernandez as he might have some ideas.
