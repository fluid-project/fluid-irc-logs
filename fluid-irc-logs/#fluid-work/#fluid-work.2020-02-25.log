2020-02-25T10:10:39  <chahar> Hey everyone, it is very new and wonderful experience to be at an IRC channel for me. I love Javascript and have made couple of fullstack projects. I use Nodejs for backend. I have also hosted an extension which I created on the chrome web store. Also, I have experience in basic IoT device programming and controlling. I had made a course project which used arduino board to map basic keys and control games. But I am still a sophomore. That's why I am
2020-02-25T10:10:40  <chahar> looking for some amazing experience over here through GSOC2020. The project: "Using a Game Controller as a Navigation Aid" really interests me and I have already started getting some crazy ideas and trying implementing stuff.
2020-02-25T10:10:52  <chahar> @the-t-in-rtf, There seems no repo as of now for this project, or is there any? Please guide me with the next step. I am learning more about the community until then.

2020-02-25T16:05:23  <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok, so I've briefly had a look at the NAPPPI thing
2020-02-25T16:05:45  <Bosmon> jhernandez - thanks so much
2020-02-25T16:05:53  <Bosmon> How can it have suddenly appeared when we have done nothing?
2020-02-25T16:06:15  <jhernandez> and to me, all the mambo may be coming from here https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii-service/tests/all-tests.js#L19-L31
2020-02-25T16:06:23  <Bosmon> christop_ may also take an interest
2020-02-25T16:06:52  <jhernandez> Bosmon: maybe your last changes on that branch to fix the "usual race condition" helped ?
2020-02-25T16:06:58  <jhernandez> that's the only thing I can think of
2020-02-25T16:07:06  <christop_> Well if you say my name three times, I certainly will.
2020-02-25T16:07:10  <christop_> Oh wait that only works with Beetlejuice.
2020-02-25T16:07:14  <christop_> Reading.
2020-02-25T16:07:24  <Bosmon> Though one was sufficient for GOD!
2020-02-25T16:07:35  <jhernandez> xD
2020-02-25T16:07:54  <Bosmon> christop_ - we would love to get the masters of the 3 projects synced up and passing in the gpii-app CI
2020-02-25T16:08:01  <christop_> :) :) :)
2020-02-25T16:08:04  <Bosmon> Before we put in your marvellous changes to update everything to VS 2017
2020-02-25T16:08:11  <christop_> Okay, what's going on with N-API?
2020-02-25T16:08:31  <Bosmon> This: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/184
2020-02-25T16:08:55  <christop_> "unable to load ref-napi"
2020-02-25T16:08:58  <jhernandez> yup
2020-02-25T16:08:59  <christop_> Are we using "ref-napi"?
2020-02-25T16:09:02  <jhernandez> it's there
2020-02-25T16:09:03  <christop_> I thought we were using "ref"?
2020-02-25T16:09:15  <christop_> looking at console log now...
2020-02-25T16:09:22  <jhernandez> but it's far :P
2020-02-25T16:09:30  <jhernandez> christop_: yes, the gpii-service uses it
2020-02-25T16:09:46  <Bosmon> The load site is here: "\\vboxsvr\vagrant\node_modules\gpii-windows\gpii-service\src\windows.js:20"

2020-02-25T16:10:01  <Bosmon> I wonder how many times we have to call his name
2020-02-25T16:10:33  <stegru> a few more times
2020-02-25T16:11:03  <jhernandez> stegru:
2020-02-25T16:11:05  <jhernandez> stegru:
2020-02-25T16:11:07  <jhernandez> :P
2020-02-25T16:11:46  <christop_> Wow that's a big log filee.

2020-02-25T16:11:53  <christop_> Okay I see the "binding.node" failure.
2020-02-25T16:12:08  <christop_> So the obvious question is: does this build _outside_ of CI?
2020-02-25T16:12:39  <jhernandez> yes
2020-02-25T16:12:46  <jhernandez> and ref-napi is there

2020-02-25T16:12:56  <jhernandez> but not in a place where the gpii-service code expects it to be located
2020-02-25T16:13:05  <christop_> So what's different in CI than on the build machine where it worked?
2020-02-25T16:13:20  <christop_> I assume this is a system config issue in CI...if it builds locally outside of CI fine.
2020-02-25T16:13:24  <jhernandez> christop_: NOTHING
2020-02-25T16:13:27  <stegru> ok, things in that directory should be isolated from the main code
2020-02-25T16:13:37  <jhernandez> it builds, the problem is that those tests don't pass anymore
2020-02-25T16:13:51  <jhernandez> stegru: mambo grudel
2020-02-25T16:14:00  <christop_> It's not building.
2020-02-25T16:14:07  <christop_> The binding is failing...which means that the build failed.
2020-02-25T16:14:12  <christop_> Even if the build didn't give errors during build.
2020-02-25T16:14:16  <jhernandez> well
2020-02-25T16:14:19  <christop_> I ran into the same problem updating things to Electron 7...
2020-02-25T16:14:31  <jhernandez> if you run npm install, it finishes well
2020-02-25T16:14:33  <christop_> I've had to find the individual issues as I've gone along, so that the bindings could load.
2020-02-25T16:14:38  <Bosmon> christop_ - that is actually one of our smaller log files
2020-02-25T16:14:38  <jhernandez> isn't this meaning that it "builds"?
2020-02-25T16:14:44  <jhernandez> :P
2020-02-25T16:14:50  <Bosmon> The full-size ones in universal will make Chrome hang : p
2020-02-25T16:15:00  <christop_> Yeah, same thing with the Electron 7 update on all of gpii-app.  "npm install" works but then "npm start" doesn't because of something with the bindings.
2020-02-25T16:15:21  <christop_> "npm install" technically builds the thing...but that doesn't mean that the thing it builds will _run_.

2020-02-25T16:15:30  <christop_> The .node files are add-ins which are DLLs.
2020-02-25T16:15:36  <jhernandez> christop_: well, forget about electron 6/7 now
2020-02-25T16:15:41  <jhernandez> in the PRESENT
2020-02-25T16:15:47  <jhernandez> we're on electron 3
2020-02-25T16:15:52  <jhernandez> and the thing is being working until now
2020-02-25T16:15:53  <christop_> You can open them in a DLL analysis program and they'll show up as being totally valid.
2020-02-25T16:16:16  <christop_> Oh, I know.  I only mentioned Electron 7 because I ran into this same issue there.
2020-02-25T16:16:22  <christop_> The error you'er seeing...
2020-02-25T16:16:32  <christop_> "14:13:44.275:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: The specified module could not be found.
2020-02-25T16:16:32  <christop_> \\?\UNC\vboxsvr\vagrant\node_modules\gpii-windows\gpii-service\node_modules\ref-napi\build\Release\binding.node
2020-02-25T16:16:32  <christop_> Error: The specified module could not be found."
2020-02-25T16:16:44  <jhernandez> yeah, that was my point
2020-02-25T16:16:51  <christop_> Is basically saying that when the gpii-service\src\windows file tries to load the add-in...
2020-02-25T16:16:52  <Bosmon> Well it's great that whatever the fault is is consistent across versions of Electron
2020-02-25T16:17:00  <jhernandez> and that's why I pointed y'all to https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii-service/tests/all-tests.js#L19-L31
2020-02-25T16:17:06  <christop_> That the file that's there (the binding.node) isn't compatible with the current environment.
2020-02-25T16:17:37  <jhernandez> and as stegru said "ok, things in that directory should be isolated from the main code"
2020-02-25T16:17:44  <christop_> What I do when I run into issues like this is:
2020-02-25T16:17:51  <christop_> 1. Reproduce the issue on a local machine
2020-02-25T16:17:59  <christop_> 2. Roll back to the previous version to make sure it worked.
2020-02-25T16:18:05  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-25T16:18:09  <christop_> 3. Do a file comparison between the two sets of file to see what's changed
2020-02-25T16:18:24  <christop_> 4. Re-make each change until something breaks.  Then I know where the problem lies.
2020-02-25T16:18:39  <christop_> Unfortunately Node is just giving us a big "waving the white flag" error here instead of telling us exactly what's going on.
2020-02-25T16:19:06  <christop_> It might be a mismatched version of binary signatures.  Or mismatched architectures.  Or mismatched Node versions.
2020-02-25T16:19:18  *** jhung_2 <jhung_2!~jhung@CPE0c473dc371c3-CM0c473dc371c0.cpe.net.fido.ca> has joined #fluid-work
2020-02-25T16:20:04  <christop_> The other "quick thing" I would try is updating ffi-napi and ref-napi to the latest versions ("npm show ffi-napi" etc.) off of NPM.  Just to see if it's a bug in those which has been fixed.  The newest releases _should_ still work with Electron 3.
2020-02-25T16:20:10  <Bosmon> christop_ - an awkward issue here is that the VM that this CI was run against was updated recently
2020-02-25T16:20:22  <christop_> Yeah, good point.
2020-02-25T16:20:29  <jhernandez> Bosmon: I don't think this made things crash
2020-02-25T16:20:32  <Bosmon> And so it will be not entirely straightforward to restore to the previous state to verify
2020-02-25T16:20:49  <christop_> So if this works fine on a local dev machine...but not on CI...then it's probably a change in the CI config that's causing the issue.
2020-02-25T16:21:04  <jhernandez> it's the "isolated" service mambo there
2020-02-25T16:21:27  <jhernandez> stegru's mambo
2020-02-25T16:21:39  <christop_> Gotta make it do the bachata or salsa or something instead?
2020-02-25T16:21:59  <Bosmon> BLACK MAMBO!
2020-02-25T16:22:00  <jhernandez> I thin, stegru is more of disco
2020-02-25T16:22:07  <christop_> stegru -- can you run the same tests that CI is doing on your local machine (in Vagrant or in your roott dev environment)?
2020-02-25T16:22:07  <jhernandez> *think
2020-02-25T16:22:25  <christop_> And if so, do they pass in your local vagrant/dev environment?
2020-02-25T16:22:26  <jhernandez> christop_: we get exactly the same failure locally
2020-02-25T16:22:28  <stegru> ok, i think i've worked it out
2020-02-25T16:22:32  <jhernandez> in our vm

2020-02-25T16:48:45  <jhernandez> Bosmon: you know, update your gpii-app's package.json5 with "gpii-windows": "stegru/windows#629631090040968ab8cb9c784e7dd868b85755d5"
2020-02-25T16:49:25  <jhernandez> meanwhile, will test it here
2020-02-25T16:49:49  <stegru> I've tested it in my head, and got no errors :)
2020-02-25T16:50:24  <jhernandez> haha

2020-02-25T17:02:54  <jhernandez> ok
2020-02-25T17:03:01  <jhernandez> now the module is there
2020-02-25T17:03:05  <jhernandez> but, same thing

2020-02-25T17:05:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: do you need to test UIO on Edge 44 or Edge 80? I have access to both on two different computers, one of which is considerably more difficult to transport than the other :)

2020-02-25T17:10:23  <Justin_o> gmoss: if it works, do mind closing the issue as can't reproduce and note the version of MS Edge you are using

2020-02-25T17:11:11  <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, well I have 44 (old engine) on my desktop here, and 80 (chromium), I'll try on 44 first?
2020-02-25T17:11:29  <gmoss> IIRC microsoft hasn't yet started pushing the chromium update, so it's still opt-in as far as I know
2020-02-25T17:12:44  <gmoss> Justin_o: reading the Jira now
2020-02-25T17:13:00  <jhernandez> well, I wonder if it's because the modules need to be build against node rather than electron
2020-02-25T17:14:09  <stegru> well, jhernandez, they should be, which is why they're built in their own chroot
2020-02-25T17:14:12  <stegru> hmm..
2020-02-25T17:14:28  <stegru> i think it's pointless running those tests in election
2020-02-25T17:14:44  <stegru> or at least, as part of the gpii-app tests
2020-02-25T17:14:45  <jhernandez> well, that was my next point
2020-02-25T17:14:52  <stegru> brb
2020-02-25T17:14:54  <jhernandez> point/suggestion
2020-02-25T17:15:22  <jhernandez> IMVHO, there's no point in running the service tests from gpii-app
2020-02-25T17:16:06  <stegru> right
2020-02-25T17:16:17  <jhernandez> sorry, but gotta run now and won't be back until 11pm or so
2020-02-25T17:16:38  <stegru> the point of the electron tests is to makesure things work in electron - but that code never gets run in electron
2020-02-25T17:17:32  <jhernandez> stegru: right, so, if Bosmon agrees with that, we should just take the gpii-service tests out of the UnitTests.js file and running them from windows in a different step
2020-02-25T17:17:49  <stegru> it's ok, i can add a `process.versions.electron` check
2020-02-25T17:18:15  <jhernandez> oh right, and not running them if we're under electron
2020-02-25T17:18:30  <jhernandez> that'd work too
2020-02-25T17:19:06  <gmoss> Justin_o: so if I open your two test HTML files in Edge 44 and the selected text field responds to changes, the bug is gone?
2020-02-25T17:20:51  <jhernandez> leaving now - I'll catch up later
2020-02-25T17:20:54  <jhernandez> :)
2020-02-25T17:22:21  <stegru> pushed the fix - bye

2020-02-25T17:24:29  <Justin_o> gmoss: I believe it has to be run as part of the all-tests.html
2020-02-25T17:24:54  <gmoss> Justin_o: I re-read the Jira, so the issue is that the selection isn't being set in an iframe when there's no user interaction

2020-02-25T17:25:27  <Justin_o> gmoss: yes
2020-02-25T17:25:29  <gmoss> the iframe test HTML doesn't work initially, but any selection changes I make manually work okay. so I guess it's still present in Edge 44
2020-02-25T17:26:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: yah, I figured that would likely be the case. I'm not sure if they are fixing issues in the older versions of Edge anymore
2020-02-25T17:26:59  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'd be surprised, but anything is possible!
2020-02-25T17:27:25  <Justin_o> :) true
2020-02-25T17:27:43  <gmoss> Justin_o: so I'll consider this still open and won't update the Jira, sound good?
2020-02-25T17:29:05  <Justin_o> well we only officially support the latest version of MS Edge, so it's doubtful we'd actually get to fixing this one either. I think we can either close as can't reproduce in latest, if it works there, or won't fix
2020-02-25T17:29:07  <Justin_o> what do you hink
2020-02-25T17:29:08  <Justin_o> think
2020-02-25T17:29:48  <Justin_o> gmoss: ^
2020-02-25T17:30:19  <gmoss> Justin_o: seems reasonable. I'll test on 80 once I have access to my laptop (it's not where I am now)
2020-02-25T17:30:28  <Justin_o> ah okay
2020-02-25T17:30:31  <Justin_o> thanks for the help
