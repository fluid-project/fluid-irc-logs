2020-03-04T17:52:11  <the-t-in-rtf> that's the failure in the pull that reupholsters the couch
2020-03-04T17:52:26  <the-t-in-rtf> Are you seeing the same?

2020-03-04T17:54:30  <clown_mtg> yes, piled very high and very deep
2020-03-04T17:55:28  <clown_mtg> The first failure I"m seeing is:  "FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: eventLog uncaught exception logging test", invovling a "isPrefsAllowedToWrite() test.

2020-03-04T18:09:59  <jhernandez> in any case, didn't expect it to pass - although I think it should :P

2020-03-04T21:19:56  <philip> Got myself some chewy s'mores and some spicy chickpeas, colinclark
2020-03-04T21:20:01  <colinclark> oh nice
2020-03-04T21:20:10  <colinclark> canadian snacks must be different
2020-03-04T21:22:41  <philip> Well, in France you just get a wheel of cheese, a nice sausage, and a tradition
2020-03-04T21:25:18  <colinclark> ouch
2020-03-04T21:25:21  <colinclark> that sounds awfully nice
2020-03-04T21:25:39  <colinclark> so let’s talk Nexus!
2020-03-04T21:25:48  <colinclark> I see simonjb left, but you can catch me up
2020-03-04T21:26:04  <colinclark> I have to confess that I’m a bit forgetful about the state of the Nexus
2020-03-04T21:26:10  <colinclark> It’s in some gpii org repositories?
2020-03-04T21:26:23  <colinclark> and then maybe Simon has some branches in his fork that are more “modern”?
2020-03-04T21:26:33  <philip> So the current repos are
2020-03-04T21:26:43  <philip> - https://github.com/GPII/nexus
2020-03-04T21:26:43  <philip> - https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-demos
2020-03-04T21:26:43  <philip> - https://github.com/simonbates/co-occurrence-engine
2020-03-04T21:26:45  <philip> - https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-client
2020-03-04T21:26:47  <philip> - https://github.com/GPII/nexus-dist
2020-03-04T21:26:49  <philip> - https://github.com/amb26/fluid-authoring/tree/FLUID-4884
2020-03-04T21:28:29  <philip> I'm thinking they should be gathered under a new folder, e.g. fluid/nexus?
2020-03-04T21:31:44  <colinclark> yeah
2020-03-04T21:31:55  <colinclark> so i think all the simonbates repos should be transferred
2020-03-04T21:32:07  <colinclark> I can transfer the GPII repos to fluid-project
2020-03-04T21:32:19  <colinclark> and we can have them be “emerging” projects or whatever
2020-03-04T21:32:29  <colinclark> which means looser technical governance, so you can merge PRs as needed
2020-03-04T21:32:53  <colinclark> I think it would be amazing for you to still submit PRs and hopefully Bosmon2 or simonjb or cindy or justin can review them
2020-03-04T21:33:11  <colinclark> does that seem reasonable, philip?
2020-03-04T21:33:25  <colinclark> treat it like an open source project within our community
2020-03-04T21:34:30  <philip> Oh yeah, absolutely
2020-03-04T21:35:38  <colinclark> awesome
2020-03-04T21:35:50  <colinclark> Justin can help with some open source mentorship
2020-03-04T21:35:53  <colinclark> Bosmon2 too, of course

2020-03-04T21:49:41  <philip> Btw, snack verdict is that the chickpeas are pretty mediocre (They lose all flavor within half a second) and the chewy s'mores are just sugary muesli bars, which isn't so bad.

2020-03-04T22:30:12  <colinclark> i’ve added you to the nexus repos
2020-03-04T22:30:25  <colinclark> and you can start working towards commit access to more stuff over time

2020-03-04T23:06:15  <philip> colinclark: Bosmon2 is walking me through an introductory issue-to-pull cycle where we update the name and dependency of the base nexus repository. What do we want to rename it to, from GPII-nexus?
2020-03-04T23:06:33  <philip> fluid-nexus, fluid-project-nexus, infusion-nexus?
2020-03-04T23:07:00  <colinclark> i’m tempted to say the last one
2020-03-04T23:07:11  <colinclark> I can say maybe not the second one
2020-03-04T23:07:22  <colinclark> so do you or Bosmon2 have a preference between the first and last?
2020-03-04T23:10:28  <philip> We like the last one (talking to him in a side channel because he can't access IRC)
2020-03-04T23:12:18  <colinclark> yes
2020-03-04T23:12:19  <colinclark> ok cool
2020-03-04T23:15:28  *** danayo <danayo!~danayo@S0106f81d0f5cda43.vc.shawcable.net> has joined #fluid-work
2020-03-04T23:18:19  <philip> So, is there a way for me to add a component to the fluidproject issue tracker, or should I just ignore that bit of the issue creation dialog?
2020-03-04T23:20:04  <aashimgarg[m]> @colinclark I just wanted to give you an update. As you know I am willing to work on project 2 for GSOC 2020.
2020-03-04T23:20:13  <philip> Bosmon2 has helped me out
2020-03-04T23:20:32  <colinclark> great, philip
2020-03-04T23:20:52  <colinclark> i guess we should see if someone can help migrate issues from the gpii issue tracker
2020-03-04T23:20:54  <colinclark> hi aashimgarg[m]
2020-03-04T23:20:57  <colinclark> i saw your email
2020-03-04T23:21:00  <colinclark> and your other notes
2020-03-04T23:21:03  <colinclark> thanks for the update
2020-03-04T23:21:37  <aashimgarg[m]> And i have working on the fluidproject and floeproject for a while now
2020-03-04T23:21:48  <philip> Yeah, we might even want to move stuff between wikis, colinclark
2020-03-04T23:21:57  <colinclark> yes, i was thinking of that too
2020-03-04T23:22:10  <colinclark> i think migrating from media wiki to confluence might just involve good old cut and paste
2020-03-04T23:22:14  <colinclark> great, aashimgarg[m]
2020-03-04T23:22:38  <aashimgarg[m]> What should be the next step colinclark ?
2020-03-04T23:22:38  <colinclark> JIRA, we should be able to do automatically
2020-03-04T23:22:53  <colinclark> but it may involve help from a sysadmin, philip
2020-03-04T23:23:02  <colinclark> aashimgarg[m]: I’m not entirely sure
2020-03-04T23:23:07  <colinclark> have you started working on a proposal?
2020-03-04T23:23:30  <aashimgarg[m]> Yes started working on it
2020-03-04T23:23:34  <colinclark> and have you read all the information about the project and about the process for GSoC?
2020-03-04T23:23:45  <colinclark> great, then that’s the next step
2020-03-04T23:24:15  <aashimgarg[m]> Yes i read the information about the project
2020-03-04T23:24:32  <sachin10101998> hey colinclark, I too sent a mail about the work updates on the same project. Did you receive it?
2020-03-04T23:24:41  <colinclark> I’m not sure, sachin10101998
2020-03-04T23:25:04  <sachin10101998> I sent it on 3rd March
2020-03-04T23:25:26  <sachin10101998> just to be sure, cclark@ocadu.ca is your mail id, right?
2020-03-04T23:25:33  <colinclark> yes
2020-03-04T23:25:50  <colinclark> now i’ll get some more spam, since the channel is logged on the web :)
2020-03-04T23:26:05  <sachin10101998> really sorry about that
2020-03-04T23:26:10  <colinclark> it’s fine, i’m kidding
2020-03-04T23:26:31  <colinclark> anyway, i have to run
2020-03-04T23:26:32  <sachin10101998> umm, I am sending the mail again directly to you. Last time you were in cc
2020-03-04T23:26:36  <colinclark> but have a great night folks
2020-03-04T23:26:47  <colinclark> and philip, i’m excited about your nexus work!
2020-03-04T23:26:51  <sachin10101998> no problem, please go through it whenever you get time
2020-03-04T23:26:51  <aashimgarg[m]> Sure colinclark
