2020-07-21T11:30:13  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: I was trying out fluid-grunt-lint-all yesterday. It gave a couple of warning.
2020-07-21T11:30:19  <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/kRrE63YY/
2020-07-21T11:30:45  <the-t-in_> yes, that's something we're seeing, it greatly depends on where npm stuffs that plugin
2020-07-21T11:31:02  <the-t-in_> if it stuffs it directly in the repo's node_modules, you're good, otherwise you can end up with that warning
2020-07-21T11:31:15  <the-t-in_> the workaround for now is to add grunt-plugin-markdown as a dev dependency
2020-07-21T11:31:21  <the-t-in_> I will write up an issue now
2020-07-21T11:31:32  <the-t-in_> @Justin_o ^^^
2020-07-21T11:31:42  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: thanks
2020-07-21T11:34:39  <Justin_o> the-t-in_:  I'm not finding grunt-plugin-markdown but I'm guessing you meant eslint-plugin-markdown
2020-07-21T11:34:47  <the-t-in_> yes
2020-07-21T11:34:52  <the-t-in_> I wrote it correctly in the ticket... ;)
2020-07-21T11:35:00  <Justin_o> :)
2020-07-21T11:35:01  <the-t-in_> https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-lint-all/issues/13
2020-07-21T11:35:41  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: what are the options you are considering for moving out of grunt?
2020-07-21T11:37:50  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: also, thanks that workaround worked well
2020-07-21T11:38:02  <the-t-in_> we haven't got that far
2020-07-21T11:38:07  <Justin_o> ah okay
2020-07-21T12:17:27  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: is it safe to update to fluid-handlebars and fluid-binder. I see that the later has a release, but the former only a dev release so far. Also fluid-handlebars seems to still depend on gpii-binder. Are those still a work in progress?
2020-07-21T12:36:48  <the-t-in_> The releases are working their way through the stack.
2020-07-21T12:36:58  <the-t-in_> I would hope that we'd release fluid-handlebars in a few days.
2020-07-21T12:37:07  <the-t-in_> Right now we are working on issues with the CouchDB test harness.
2020-07-21T12:37:26  <the-t-in_> which I *think* we just solved
2020-07-21T12:37:47  <the-t-in_> unfortunately no childcare tomorrow (caregiver sprained an ankle), so I'd say Thursday on the full release
2020-07-21T12:37:54  <the-t-in_> however, it should be safe to use the dev release of fluid-handlebars
2020-07-21T12:38:10  <the-t-in_> the updates are minor from here on in, there was no refactoring involved beyond the name changes
2020-07-21T12:46:30  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: thanks for the update and hope the caregiver is okay. We can wait for the full release if it's coming soon. I'm just prepping updates to dependencies in story telling.
2020-07-21T13:58:08  <the-t-in_> She's fine, just not quite fine enough to keep up with our son yet.
2020-07-21T13:58:10  <the-t-in_> he's speedy.
2020-07-21T13:58:30  <the-t-in_> Anyway, so is Antranig, he merged fluid-handlebars and I cut the full release just now.
2020-07-21T13:58:52  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: awesome!! thanks.. I was just updating that to the dev release, so your timing is perfect
2020-07-21T13:59:16  <the-t-in_> It'll probably still be later in the week before we get all the way to fluid-express-user, but it's generally just transitioning from dev to full releases at this point.
2020-07-21T13:59:49  <Justin_o> the-t-in_: sounds good.. danayo is also working on designs for our integration of it
2020-07-21T13:59:58  <the-t-in_> ah, cool.
2020-07-21T14:00:20  <the-t-in_> I think Cindy's idea is really best if you have a proper designer rather than me playing legos with Foundation sites styles.
2020-07-21T14:00:27  <the-t-in_> don't even try to use my UI.
2020-07-21T14:01:26  <Justin_o> haha thanks for the warning, I'm sure it was fine though.
2020-07-21T15:04:24  <Justin_o> gtirloni: can we remove this file from Infusion https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/trigger-ci
2020-07-21T15:05:28  <gtirloni> O_O yes, please. that shouldn't be there
2020-07-21T15:05:31  <gtirloni> sorry about it
2020-07-21T15:07:07  <Justin_o> gtirloni: no problem, I'll pull it out in my FLUID-6529 work
2020-07-21T15:07:17  <gtirloni> thanks
2020-07-21T15:08:00  <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for the suggestion about codecov.io I'm getting the integration setup for it.
2020-07-21T15:08:20  <gtirloni> awesome
2020-07-21T15:47:27  <gmoss> philip: does the biodiversity work you mentioned involve Andrew Simon? sounds very familiar :)
2020-07-21T15:47:43  <philip> That's the guy :)
2020-07-21T15:50:20  <gmoss> fun!
2020-07-21T15:50:39  <gmoss> he gave a talk for us a couple years ago, we might have recorded it
2020-07-21T15:54:06  <alanharnum> My friend mentioned this on the walk this morning - generative text adventures using AI: https://play.aidungeon.io/ - interesting artistic / play use
2020-07-21T16:13:13  <Teddy___> Wow this is so cool!
2020-07-21T16:13:41  <michelled> Teddy___: we haven't checked in in a while - are you available at 3:00 today?
2020-07-21T16:13:59  <Teddy___> Yup sure am
2020-07-21T16:14:13  <michelled> great!
2020-07-21T16:16:38  <michelled> alanharnum: I'm a little afraid to play this to be honest :)
2020-07-21T16:17:50  <alanharnum> michelled: well, a demon pulled my head off, but then I put my head back on and befriended the demon by repeatedly hugging it, and then I grew angel wings and flew to school where I had my French class and hung out with my friends
2020-07-21T16:18:07  <michelled> haha, amazing
2020-07-21T16:30:15  <gmoss> alanharnum: I've seen this played by streamers, it's pretty interesting haha :) I'll give it a shot, thanks for sharing!
2020-07-21T16:54:36  <dogeman> gmoss what should we do about the styling issue when we convert html of posts to pure markdown?
2020-07-21T16:55:09  <dogeman> similar issue is there in floeproject and jhung said that only those html tags should stay which are used for styling purposes.  others like <li> and <p> nee dot removed
2020-07-21T16:55:18  <dogeman> Should I do that in both?
2020-07-21T16:55:25  <dogeman> need to*
2020-07-21T17:01:06  <gmoss>  dogeman yeah I think jhung's suggestion would be ideal if it's possible! and if it works, then it would be best to do that in both sites so they're consistent with each other
2020-07-21T17:02:12  <gmoss> dogeman: so using Markdown as much as possible, but if you need a particular style to be applied then you can add HTML for that part of the file only
2020-07-21T17:02:32  <dogeman> perfect
2020-07-21T17:03:47  <dogeman> there's one more problem about spaces and line breaks.
2020-07-21T17:03:59  <dogeman> Markdown gives linting error if any line has more than 120 characters.
2020-07-21T17:04:37  <gmoss> dogeman: yeah that rule is a bit of a pain. It's exempt in certain cases, like if it's a URL, for instance
2020-07-21T17:04:39  <dogeman> I broke those lines which have more than 120 characters into multiple lines and hence those line breaks and spaces are there
2020-07-21T17:04:50  <dogeman> The URL is giving error too.
2020-07-21T17:05:42  <gmoss> that's surprising! let me take a look at the documentation on ESLint's site to see what the specifics are
2020-07-21T17:05:55  <gmoss> wait not eslint...
2020-07-21T17:07:25  <dogeman> ok
2020-07-21T17:14:39  <gmoss> dogeman: this details exactly what cases are passing and failing, hopefully it's useful for you: https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md013
2020-07-21T17:14:55  <gmoss> other rules are on that page as well
2020-07-21T17:15:37  <gmoss> we can pair and look over these tomorrow, if you like
2020-07-21T17:16:41  <dogeman> sure.
2020-07-21T17:16:50  <dogeman> Will resolve other review points
2020-07-21T17:17:01  <gmoss> dogeman: great, thanks :)
2020-07-21T17:18:08  <dogeman> np
2020-07-21T19:51:25  <gmoss> Justin_o: I'm testing your SJRK-370 work right now, server tests failed until I fixed an outstanding instance of the old uuid declaration, browser tests are reliably hanging in Firefox, looking into it now
2020-07-21T19:52:06  <gmoss> browser tests pass without issue in Chrome 84 & Edge 44
2020-07-21T19:52:23  <Justin_o> gmoss: ah I forgot to run the server tests ;(
2020-07-21T19:52:33  <gmoss> Justin_o: no worries :) it was a one-line fix
2020-07-21T19:52:35  <Justin_o> gmoss: I did run all the browser tests in Firefox though, so that's a bit strange
2020-07-21T19:53:02  <gmoss> yeah it's also strange that it fails 100% of the time in Firefox but 0% of the time in the others
2020-07-21T19:53:33  <gmoss> maybe one of the deps from the FLUID-6524 work uses an API feature that's not supported or was previously deprecated
2020-07-21T19:53:40  <gmoss> and/or
2020-07-21T19:56:15  <gmoss> "Cannot parse context reference \"{that].options.addNewHistoryEntry\": Malformed context reference without }" hmm this seems familiar
2020-07-21T19:56:28  <gmoss> looks like it's from fluid-location-bar-relay
2020-07-21T19:57:10  <gmoss> (the tests are hanging waiting for a model value to change related to visibility of one of the editor steps, which is in turn related to the historian component (itself a fluid-location-bar-relay))
2020-07-21T19:57:48  <Justin_o> that should have been fixed in the update to that file
2020-07-21T19:57:56  <Justin_o> update to that dependency
2020-07-21T19:58:24  <Justin_o> if you haven't already tried to clear out the node_modules directory and re-install, could you try that
2020-07-21T19:58:52  <gmoss> Justin_o: I cleared Firefox's cache, that seemed to solve it. glad it was so simple! I'd cleared cookies and localStorage but forgot about cache
2020-07-21T19:58:53  <Justin_o> another thing to check is to run "npm outdated" the only things that should show there would be infusion and the one that points at a git endpoint
2020-07-21T19:59:06  <Justin_o> ah okay :) that's great
2020-07-21T19:59:15  <gmoss> I thought that the cached version was correct as well though
2020-07-21T19:59:23  <gmoss> ah well! seems fine so I'm happy :)
2020-07-21T20:03:03  <Justin_o> strange, but sometimes funny things happen with caches I guess.
2020-07-21T20:08:14  <gmoss> Justin_o: I think i've grown dependent on the fact that I have Chrome disabling the cache any time the dev tools are open, I must not have set that in Firefox
2020-07-21T20:09:41  <gmoss> Justin_o: i'm just running a bunch of tests locally, and then I'll comment on the PR and leave a piece of review for the one line that needs to be fixed, otherwise it's looking great
2020-07-21T20:09:51  <Justin_o> gmoss: I tend to do all my testing in private/incognito mode and just routinely close and reopen those instances
2020-07-21T20:10:00  <gmoss> Justin_o: that's wise!
2020-07-21T20:10:08  <Justin_o> gmoss: great thanks
2020-07-21T20:10:42  <gmoss> I haven't been able to reproduce FLUID-6512 or FLUID-6523, so that's good
2020-07-21T20:12:37  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks for double checking that as well
2020-07-21T20:26:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: what are the manual-Tests files for in  the story telling tests? https://github.com/fluid-project/sjrk-story-telling/blob/master/tests/ui/html/blockUi-editor-audioBlockEditor-manual-Tests.html
2020-07-21T20:30:13  <gmoss> Justin_o: sorry had to step away for a moment there. Do you mean to ask where the files I use for manual testing are located?
2020-07-21T20:30:41  <gmoss> or what the purpose of the html files that end in "manual-Tests" is?
2020-07-21T20:30:47  <Justin_o> More so are those strictly for manual testing.. just curious because they are co-located with the unit tests and seem to include the same js files
2020-07-21T20:30:54  <Justin_o> the latter
2020-07-21T20:33:04  <gmoss> Justin_o: right, so these are to catch unexpected issues that can't easily be automated or that we simply haven't added to automation yet. Currently this means the three media file editors so you can test the file upload behaviour (I think browser security restrictions keep that from being tested properly) and the storyEditor reordering behaviour (all three reorderer methods, especially drag-and-drop)
2020-07-21T20:33:46  <Justin_o> gmoss: should they be styled? and should they include the test javascript files?
2020-07-21T20:34:14  <Justin_o> and I suppose all the qunit related includes can be dropped too?
2020-07-21T20:35:03  <gmoss> Justin_o: I don't think styling beyond what's present in each file is necessary since they only test functionality. I think there was a reason I decided to include the test JS files, but can't recall at the moment. It seems reasonable to drop qunit includes, though if we do that but do find a need for the test JS files, will the latter work without the former?
2020-07-21T20:36:09  <Justin_o> gmoss: there are probably dependencies on the assertions.
2020-07-21T20:36:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: so I think we should move the manual tests into a directory that is a sibling to the ui, server, and testData repos.
2020-07-21T20:36:42  <gmoss> Justin_o: right, but in the manual tests, if those assertions aren't being run (which they shouldn't be), i wonder if there's any other reason they need to be kept
2020-07-21T20:36:50  <gmoss> Justin_o: that seems very reasonable
2020-07-21T20:36:53  <Justin_o> and try to remove the dependency between the manual tests and the unit tests.
2020-07-21T20:37:19  <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, I'll look into that with the SJRK-122 work
2020-07-21T20:37:44  <gmoss> sounds great :)
2020-07-21T20:38:38  <Justin_o> gmoss: I'm in the process of getting the unit tests working separate from the story telling server.. it will always test against the base theme though.
2020-07-21T20:39:30  <gmoss> Justin_o: IIRC we have a Jira for getting the browser tests to run with different themes
2020-07-21T20:41:00  <Justin_o> gmoss: if you happen to find that, could you please send it my way.. not sure I'll be able to tackle that in this work, but will think about it. We might just need to loop through the themes and run the tests multiple times.. or use those refactor the tests into shareable sequences that we run each theme against
2020-07-21T20:41:25  <gmoss> Justin_o: it's already linked to SJRK-122, in fact: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-303
2020-07-21T20:41:40  <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks
2020-07-21T20:42:28  <gmoss> Justin_o: thank you :) I'm glad you're able to tackle some of these non user facing aspects of the tool, it should make development and testing smoother
2020-07-21T20:43:12  <Justin_o> :) np problem. it's nice that we have a bit of spare time in this cycle to get to these.
2020-07-21T20:43:24  <gmoss> yeah! or in my case, a bit of time off ;P
2020-07-21T20:43:26  <Justin_o> and fortunately you already wrote so many tests :)
2020-07-21T20:43:30  <Justin_o> :)
2020-07-21T20:43:48  <gmoss> Justin_o: once we've got code coverage reporting in, you'll see just how much is still missing haha
2020-07-21T20:45:17  <Justin_o> haha.. maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised
2020-07-21T21:04:00  <gmoss> Justin_o: I've left a comment on your PR detailing my review findings :)
2020-07-21T21:04:58  <Justin_o> gmoss: great thanks, I'll take a look at that tomorrow.. hopefully this will all be in by the time you get back
2020-07-21T21:05:15  <gmoss> Justin_o: hopefully so :)
2020-07-21T21:05:17  <gmoss> thanks!
2020-07-21T21:18:00  <Uttara> @cindyli: yes lets make the TOC for desktop 14px, I will update that in figma. For some reason I am not able to find your comment in GitHub. Hence replying here
