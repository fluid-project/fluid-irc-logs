Also the audio walk was fantastic and it gave me a lot to think about. I really enjoyed it. :)

2017-10-26T15:35:12 <danayo> ah, thanks
2017-10-26T15:35:20 <grrrero> I\'m not attempting to write 2 whole pages because Jutta will definitely take over
2017-10-26T15:35:34 <grrrero> But would love it if someone could help distill it further before it reaches her hands

2017-10-26T15:58:50 <grrrero> Caren_: Oh sorry, I think something like a statement from them voicing their support for a platform coop for caregivers -- like if there was a press release of some sort?

2017-10-26T20:37:31 <lliskovoi> clown: is aria-expanded required where aria-haspopup is used?
2017-10-26T20:38:28 * clown doesn\'t remember; looks it up.
2017-10-26T20:39:20 * Jess_ has quit
2017-10-26T20:39:32 <clown> lliskovoi:  what is the role of the element?
2017-10-26T20:40:40 <lliskovoi> It\'s a <button> element
2017-10-26T20:42:52 <clown> I\'m assumed the <button> has the aria-haspopup attribute.  Then it should also have an aria-controls referencing the popup, and aria-expanded to indicate when the popup is "popped"
2017-10-26T20:43:42 <lliskovoi> it makes sense to me, but I couldn\'t find any documentation that called for/suggested it. so it\'s recommended but not necessary?
2017-10-26T20:44:16 <clown> I actually don\'t know if it\'s required, but keyboard focus will be on the button when it\'s pushed via a SPACE, and likely remains there.  If so, you need some way to indicate, there is now a menu popped up.
2017-10-26T20:44:52 <clown> so a down arrow goes to the expected first menu item.
2017-10-26T20:45:28 <clown> did you check the APG?  I\'ve only looked at the spec so far.
2017-10-26T20:45:33 <lliskovoi> ah, in this case if it\'s next in the tab order
2017-10-26T20:45:38 <clown> https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-expanded
2017-10-26T20:45:56 <clown> so, they are not using arrows to navigate the menu?  Odd.
2017-10-26T20:46:36 <lliskovoi> no, Enter to expand the menu, and then tab to move into it
2017-10-26T20:46:43 <clown> well, you still want to know where your TAB key stroke is going to go.  If you\'re told "on a button, expanded" you can legitimately expect to go next to the menu items.
2017-10-26T20:46:45 <lliskovoi> actually let me check that I can\'t also get into it using arrows
2017-10-26T20:47:22 <lliskovoi> nope, arrows don\'t do anything
2017-10-26T20:47:53 * clown looking up the APG, just to see what it says
2017-10-26T20:48:05 <lliskovoi> Ok, I\'m going to recommend they use aria-expanded for sure, just wondering if it\'s required and I missed it or if it\'s more of an additional suggestions
2017-10-26T20:49:40 <clown> https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menubutton
2017-10-26T20:50:04 <clown> they have yet another keyboard model, but they do recommend using aria-expanded.
2017-10-26T20:50:19 * jhung has quit
2017-10-26T20:56:58 <clown> lliskovoi:  the place where required crops up is in the "characteristics table" for a role.  In this case <button> is the role, but aria-expanded can\'t be listed as required because it might not be a menu button.
2017-10-26T20:57:04 <clown> See https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#button
2017-10-26T20:57:28 <clown> but, it does call out aria-pressed and aria-expanded as "supported".
2017-10-26T20:58:16 <clown> In that sense, if you are using a button as a toggle button, aria-pressed is required.
2017-10-26T20:59:03 <clown> I\'m 90% sure that if you use a button as a menu buttons, then aria-expanded is required.
2017-10-26T20:59:14 <clown> by the toggle button/aria-pressed logic.
