2017-10-16T20:24:37 <danaayotte> sepidehshahi, alanharnum, colinclark: I created this document to think through the 3 different design activiites and start to list specific activities we might want to try in each part. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AfHq2NIBgkf55G9dkx2eK8QW_Hr5XPzIpuAWNMKr6PE/edit?usp=sharing\x0f
2017-10-16T20:24:56 <danaayotte> I also found it helpful to break down the goals into project/platform/co-design session- it was useful for me to consider and I think might be useful for the participants
2017-10-16T20:26:25 <alanharnum> danaayotte: this is really helpful, thanks!
2017-10-16T20:26:45 <alanharnum> my only comment after a first read is we may want to explicitly include the questions about pedagogy that I know Carla is specifically interested in
2017-10-16T20:29:17 <danaayotte> oh right alanharnum
2017-10-16T20:29:25 <danaayotte> yes
2017-10-16T20:30:43 <sepidehshahi> danaayotte: thanks this is really helpful and the way you have broke down goals and activities makes it really clear
2017-10-16T20:30:59 <danaayotte> great sepidehshahi  :D
2017-10-16T20:32:56 <sepidehshahi> danaayotte: what time would you like to talk about the design activities tomorrow?

2017-10-16T14:14:34 <alanharnum> danayo_ danayo colinclark in particular ^

2017-10-16T14:18:55 <danayo_> grrrero: BY THE WAY - I forgot to mention on Friday that https://sojustrepairit.org/index.html looks great!
2017-10-16T14:19:02 <danayo_> I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the latest before I opened it in the middle of our meeting

2017-10-16T15:02:06 <simonjb> alanharnum: thanks for the info on Cubetto; the people you met at DEEP, were they from Primo or just users of it?
2017-10-16T15:03:57 <alanharnum> simonjb: not from Primo - I believe they work on special education in the classroom (colinclark, is that correct?)
2017-10-16T15:04:13 <colinclark> they are from bridges
2017-10-16T15:04:18 <alanharnum> simonjb: https://www.bridges-canada.com/
2017-10-16T15:04:23 <alanharnum> I believe that\'s them
2017-10-16T15:05:08 <simonjb> got it, thanks
2017-10-16T15:05:39 <alanharnum> simonjb: I hadn\'t heard of Bret Victor\'s work before you mentioned it & found this a pretty good intro: https://limn.it/utopian-hacks/
2017-10-16T15:07:00 <simonjb> thanks alanharnum, haven\'t seen this article before, will check it out

2017-10-16T15:18:14 <danayo_> hello there colinclark: are you available at 2 for a BiT meeting?
2017-10-16T15:18:22 <colinclark> sadly not, no
2017-10-16T15:18:36 <colinclark> it looks like i\'m likely booked straight through until 4 pm today
2017-10-16T15:19:28 <danayo_> ok, we will you in afterwards, if that\xe2\x80\x99s alright. looks like Andrea is only available until 4
2017-10-16T15:20:04 <colinclark> sounds fine, thanks
2017-10-16T15:20:04 <danayo_> colinclark ^
2017-10-16T15:20:07 <danayo_> great
2017-10-16T15:21:45 <danayo_> colinclark: let me know if there is anything you want me to mention - I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorting out details about handouts, access guide and schedule - still have to decide on a collection of design activities in the next couple of days
2017-10-16T15:22:02 <colinclark> ok
2017-10-16T15:22:15 <colinclark> i\'d love to chat about the design activities when we can find a good mutual time
2017-10-16T15:22:25 <colinclark> but otherwise, it sounds like it\'s moving along really well
2017-10-16T15:22:30 <colinclark> thanks for all your hard work on it
2017-10-16T15:23:38 <danayo_> np colinclark: i would love to meet about the activities too! does tomorrow some time work for you?
2017-10-16T15:24:01 <danayo_> afternoon?
2017-10-16T15:24:38 <colinclark> we can find a time tomorrow, yes
2017-10-16T15:24:44 <colinclark> i\'m not 100% sure when yet

2017-10-16T16:52:35 <sepidehshahi> Hi Jess_ do you mean the survey? I\xe2\x80\x99m writing in the P4A template and it\xe2\x80\x99s offilne. It\xe2\x80\x99s in really stages so maybe I can work a bit more on it and then send it to you.
2017-10-16T16:52:54 <sepidehshahi> *early stages
2017-10-16T16:52:55 <Jess_> yes, sepidehshahi the survey
2017-10-16T16:53:13 <Jess_> ok, re early stages \xe2\x80\x94 i started soemthing last week too
2017-10-16T16:53:16 <Jess_> very drafty
2017-10-16T16:53:19 <Jess_> we can combine
2017-10-16T16:54:12 <sepidehshahi> great! if we can send out the survey soon, hopefully we get some responses back before end of the month. and we really need those responses to be able to write something for 103.2
2017-10-16T16:56:02 <danayo_> Justin_o: I just added some links to the Community Meeting wiki page re: the biodiversity community meeting on the 8th
2017-10-16T16:57:02 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: agreed
2017-10-16T17:01:38 <danayo_> simonjb, sepidehshahi, alanharnum, colinclark, everyone - relevant to MyL3 and Nexus data gathering: a good example of a high resolution weather station network established around Victoria BC http://www.victoriaweather.ca

2017-10-16T17:10:08 <sepidehshahi> jhung: we had a plan to talk about MyL3 tomorrow. However, I have not had a chance to apply some of the changes recommended last time. danayo_ what do you think? should we postpone it a few weeks, so I can update the design or should we have the same design and continue the discussion?
2017-10-16T17:10:25 <danayo_> sepidehshahi: I vote for waiting
2017-10-16T17:10:59 <sepidehshahi> sounds good to me danayo_
