2017-09-28T15:09:17 <simonjb> good morning danayo, is there a learning dashboard meeting today? would it be worthwhile for me to join?
2017-09-28T15:11:18 <Jess_> everyone: i cannot attend standup or Vidyo meetings today. I am leaving a room open for report participants to test connecting to Vidyo for our many large upcoming events
2017-09-28T15:11:19 <danayo> hi simonjb: yes! there is. it\'s at 1ET. sepidehshahi and I can talk through some of the latest design changes. I guess we\'re meeting about nexus+MyL3+storytelling right afterwards as well.
2017-09-28T15:12:08 <simonjb> great, thanks danayo
2017-09-28T15:20:37 <danayo> colinclark: this is so interesting, from Donald Norman\'s paper: "The perceivable part of an affordance is a signifier, and if deliberately placed by a designer, it is a social signifier. Designers of the world: Forget affordances. Provide signifiers."
2017-09-28T15:20:48 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-28T15:21:28 <colinclark> to me, the point that\'s most interesting is actually that opens up the possibility of a mild erosion of the "control" model of design
2017-09-28T15:21:44 <colinclark> despite the "deliberately placed by a designer"
2017-09-28T15:21:53 <danayo> yeah, i was thinking about that
2017-09-28T15:21:58 <colinclark> it\'s clear that lots of things are simply recognized as a signifier, regardless of intent :)
2017-09-28T15:22:04 <danayo> that accidental aspect - totally
2017-09-28T15:22:33 <colinclark> it also suggests a kind of civic model
2017-09-28T15:22:52 <colinclark> in which other people can place and recognize signifiers
2017-09-28T15:23:07 <danayo> yes
2017-09-28T15:23:14 <danayo> it seems a bit counter to his argument in a way, to "provide signifiers"
2017-09-28T15:23:21 <danayo> re: the control point
2017-09-28T15:24:31 <danayo> but also, I suppose a signifier allows an open-ended kind of interaction, vs. an affordance, perhaps?
2017-09-28T15:25:20 <danayo> so you can provide a signifier, but how it gets interpreted is up to the "user" - I guess that\'s the point :)
2017-09-28T15:25:58 <colinclark> yes, precisely
2017-09-28T15:28:01 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-28T15:39:41 <grrrero> danayo: Link to the article you mentioned in standup? :3
2017-09-28T15:40:08 <danayo> page 18 here grrrero: http://www.maketools.com/articles-papers/interactions20081112_dl.pdf
2017-09-28T15:40:21 <grrrero> Awesome thanks danayo
2017-09-28T15:40:43 <danayo> the liz sanders article in front of that one is interesting too grrrero
2017-09-28T15:40:57 <grrrero> Cool cool danayo
2017-09-28T15:44:46 <simonjb> danayo: I was also able to find a version of "Signifiers, not affordances" on the web https://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/signifiers_not_affordances.html
2017-09-28T15:45:05 <danayo> thanks simonjb
2017-09-28T15:46:49 <danayo> I\'m going to add these article links here everyone: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusive+Design%2C+Co-Design%2C+and+Co-Creation+Resources
2017-09-28T15:47:41 <simonjb> awesome!

2017-09-28T15:54:32 <colinclark> we should link to the UTOPIA article I pasted the other day
2017-09-28T15:55:06 <colinclark> courtesy of Bosmon and our friend at Aarhus University, Clemens Klokmose
2017-09-28T15:55:34 <Bosmon> I got another, even better one today from TCHERNAUSKIJ
2017-09-28T15:55:45 <colinclark> oh great!
2017-09-28T15:55:54 <Bosmon> https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-23315-9_21.pdf
2017-09-28T15:56:02 <Bosmon> This one\'s so good that I think it could be sent to ordinary human beings
2017-09-28T15:56:08 <Bosmon> Guildsmen, and the like ....
2017-09-28T15:58:01 <colinclark> that random string of characters that Bosmon referred to in all-caps above deferences into this guy, just for the record: https://www.lri.fr/membre_en.php?mb=2233
2017-09-28T15:58:22 <colinclark> who is a smart young PhD student in Paris who we met at the Programming 2017 conference in Brussels
2017-09-28T15:58:42 <Bosmon> Thanks, Knuth :)
2017-09-28T15:59:33 <Bosmon> Paper contains great touchstones such as "Pelle Ehn, UTOPIA\xe2\x80\x99s
2017-09-28T15:59:33 <Bosmon> project leader, rephrased Ford\xe2\x80\x99s assertion as, "democracy stops at the office door and
2017-09-28T15:59:33 <Bosmon> the factory gate" [29]. "
2017-09-28T16:03:11 <colinclark> it\'s amazing how these concerns are starting to come full circle with our work on platform cooperatives
2017-09-28T16:13:45 <Caren_> speidehshahi: would you happen to know where IDRC logos are housed? I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for a logo with the name IDRC included
2017-09-28T16:18:17 <Caren_> sepidehshahi^
2017-09-28T16:18:50 <sepidehshahi> yes Caren_ let me send you a link.
2017-09-28T16:21:22 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: is this what you are looking for? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/faoZleZSCwHFrbA
2017-09-28T16:24:27 <Caren_> thank you, sepidehshahi
2017-09-28T16:24:35 <sepidehshahi> yw
2017-09-28T16:26:39 <Caren_> Justin_o: here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick resource (used in type teaching/historical overview now!) of letterspacing  and wordspacing. Letterspacing is in fact the term used in metal type days! https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/IDRC-Design/Typography&fileid=22233#pdfviewer
2017-09-28T16:29:36 <Justin_o> Caren_: thanks that\'s helpful
2017-09-28T16:32:00 <Caren_> Let me know if this book might be of interest. I have it at home. https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=gswEBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en_GB&pg=GBS.PT4
2017-09-28T16:33:27 <Caren_> Justin_o: ^
2017-09-28T16:37:26 <Justin_o> Caren_: thanks, it might be interesting to know what the section on "Space between characters" says. Although the other link you provided was quite helpful. It says "In phototypesetting, letterspacing is measured in units (and sometimes half-units)..."
2017-09-28T16:38:11 <Justin_o> "The unit, unlike the point and the pica, is not a fixed measurement. Because it is based on the em... , the unit varies with each type size."
2017-09-28T16:40:52 <Caren_> yes. And in inDesign there are specific white spaces that you can apply, for egs: en space before and after an em dash so it is always consistent. That en space with scale up and down depending on the point size chosen for the line or paragraph of type.
2017-09-28T16:41:29 <Caren_> these devices are from metal setting conventions
2017-09-28T16:42:32 <Justin_o> That\'s interesting.. i did a quick search and couldn\'t see an equivalent of that for css

2017-09-28T16:57:16 <Caren_> Justin_o: I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring the Lupton book in\xe2\x80\xa6perhaps it will shed some light on that equivilent or lack thereof.
2017-09-28T16:57:44 <Justin_o> Caren_: thanks :) appreciate that
2017-09-28T16:57:49 <Caren_> np
2017-09-28T17:00:50 <Caren_> everyone: sepidehshahi shared the most amazing tool for the channel with me. 1) Type the first letter of a person\xe2\x80\x99s channel name. 2) press tab to cycle through names. No more typing out and transposing letters for me! made my week :-)
2017-09-28T17:01:49 <Caren_> It may be an obvious tool to many but if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for me I thought it might not be for others.
2017-09-28T17:03:18 <simonjb> hi danayo, where are you meeting for the learning dashboard discussion?
2017-09-28T17:03:20 <sepidehshahi> :)

2017-09-28T19:51:35 <danayo> with the version of the logo that is in the AI file you should just be able to select parts of it and change the colour
2017-09-28T19:51:46 <danayo> does that make sense?
2017-09-28T19:53:48 <grrrero> danayo: Yup! Also gmoss helped out; thank you both :)
