2017-03-31T20:35:37 <Jess_> michelled: ping
2017-03-31T20:36:08 <michelled> hi Jess_
2017-03-31T20:36:50 <Jess_> michelled: jutta just called and asked for us to work on trying to put together some required information for the website associated with the report you wrote\xe2\x80\xa6 she\xe2\x80\x99s sending us an email now i think
2017-03-31T20:36:54 <Jess_> and i think it\xe2\x80\x99s urgent
2017-03-31T20:37:08 <Jess_> perhaps you already know what needs to be done?
2017-03-31T20:37:14 <michelled> I'm currently writing a summary that is required
2017-03-31T20:37:19 <michelled> I think I had better finish that first
2017-03-31T20:37:32 <Jess_> a summary for the website? or for the report?
2017-03-31T20:37:50 * cindyli has quit
2017-03-31T20:38:00 <michelled> oh by 'website' does she mean the OPC website?
2017-03-31T20:38:14 <michelled> if she does, then it is the same thing
2017-03-31T20:38:15 <Jess_> she means teh 250 word summary
2017-03-31T20:38:21 <michelled> yes, I'm writing that
2017-03-31T20:38:25 <Jess_> ah ok
2017-03-31T20:38:50 <Jess_> michelled: anything i can help with?
2017-03-31T20:39:28 <michelled> I don't think so, unless Jutta needs help with formatting the actual report. the summary structure is specified in detail by the OPC. I think I'm fine to follow that
2017-03-31T20:39:54 <michelled> the report itself probably needs to look like other reports we have submitted - which I have never been involved with
2017-03-31T20:40:15 <Jess_> yeah, michelled she\xe2\x80\x99s working with Vera on the format now
2017-03-31T20:40:40 <Jess_> michelled: i see the format they want on this page https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/research/funding-for-privacy-research-and-knowledge-translation/information-for-contributions-program-funding-recipients/p_rec_wg/
2017-03-31T20:40:57 <Jess_> jutta is asking me to help \xe2\x80\x9cCan you add the other info they want and merge it into a single doc?\xe2\x80\x9d
2017-03-31T20:40:58 <michelled> yes, that's what sent to Jutta this morning and am now following
2017-03-31T20:41:40 <Jess_> michelled: just sent you the format she was talking about in Skype
2017-03-31T20:41:51 <michelled> yes, that's from that same web page
2017-03-31T20:42:12 <Jess_> michelled: carry on\xe2\x80\xa6 let me try to figure out what she\xe2\x80\x99s after
2017-03-31T20:44:40 * colinclark has quit
2017-03-31T20:51:44 <Jess_> michelled: what\xe2\x80\x99s the official name of the project?
2017-03-31T20:52:40 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-03-31T20:52:44 <michelled> Jess, I already have all this in a doc
2017-03-31T20:52:59 <michelled> if you want, I can send that to you now
2017-03-31T20:53:04 <Jess_> michelled: ok, cool
2017-03-31T20:53:04 <michelled> or I can continue to work on the summary
2017-03-31T20:53:36 <Jess_> i\xe2\x80\x99m trying to help Vera, so if you could send what you have that might help me do that, then i\xe2\x80\x99ll pipe down and you can work on teh summary
