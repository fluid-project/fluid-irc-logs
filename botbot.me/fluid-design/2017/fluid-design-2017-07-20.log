2017-07-20T17:30:26 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: where do the svgs for the infusion icons live
2017-07-20T17:31:07 <Justin_o> actually just found them.. i see now that there\'s a separate folder for UIO and Infusion
2017-07-20T17:31:20 <Justin_o> we might want to put UIO under infusion, but i guess that\'s up to you
2017-07-20T17:34:20 <jhung> Justin_o: glad you found them. I\'m fine with reorganizing if it makes it easier to find.
2017-07-20T17:35:47 <Justin_o> grrrero: this might also be helpful https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Research+SVG+Icons

2017-07-20T20:55:14 <danayo> alanharnum: a very basic beginning (though probably already overly complex) https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/K1ya8ka55anA7pc
2017-07-20T20:55:40 <alanharnum> thanks danayo!
2017-07-20T20:55:54 <alanharnum> this looks great
2017-07-20T20:56:00 <danayo> cool
2017-07-20T20:56:15 <danayo> selecting "done" on first page leads to second page
2017-07-20T20:56:24 <danayo> selecting "read other stories" on first page leads to third page
2017-07-20T20:56:44 <danayo> the last page is the output
