2017-05-03T18:28:45 <Caren> Looks good, jhung. Only one thought: wonder if the word intimidating might be swapped with something like \xe2\x80\x9cdaunting\xe2\x80\x9d.
2017-05-03T18:29:56 <jhung> Caren, good point. I updated that line.
2017-05-03T18:31:47 <jhung> Caren, if that looks good, maybe you can put it into the template you've already made for the event?
2017-05-03T18:33:03 * michelled1 joined the channel
2017-05-03T18:33:18 <Caren> Did you want it to be handed out with the Event Info sheet? FYI I sent out just the Event Info to all participants, including facilitators, via email
2017-05-03T18:33:39 * clown joined the channel
2017-05-03T18:36:18 <jhung> Caren: The consent form can be done tomorrow.

2017-05-03T18:36:36 <jhung> Partcipants can pick it up with their name tags.
2017-05-03T18:37:40 <Caren> I will endeavour to make an accessible version in time. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to print out hard copies for tomorrow.
2017-05-03T18:54:28 <jhung> Caren: want to sync up on the groupings?
2017-05-03T18:55:53 <Caren> jhung: Ok if I make a cup of tea, and then join your room?
2017-05-03T18:56:04 <jhung> Sure. Ping me when ready.
2017-05-03T19:03:19 <Caren> jhung: ready
2017-05-03T19:19:02 <jhung> jessm, gtirloni: We're thinking of recording tomorrow's Create-A-Thon in the collab room using Vidyo. Is it possible to record the entire session (3 hours). Is that possible?
2017-05-03T19:21:05 <Caren> danayo, hi! checking that you got the Create-a-Thon email :-) So great that you will be participating!

2017-05-03T19:24:17 <danayo> thanks Caren. will there be other remote participants?

2017-05-03T19:26:12 <gtirloni> jhung: we once recorded a DevOps Day session.. i think it was 12 hours and it worked fine
2017-05-03T19:26:17 <gtirloni> jhung: that should work!

2017-05-03T19:41:03 <jhung> gtirloni: awesome. We'll do that. Thanks!
2017-05-03T19:42:25 <jhung> danayo: we have possibly 2 people from PhET jumping in but not staying the entire time. You would be the only one remote joining for the whole duration.
2017-05-03T19:42:56 <jhung> danayo: we'll configure the conferencing so you can Skype into a particular break-out group so you don't get all the audio from the rest of the room.
2017-05-03T19:44:15 <danayo> sounds great jhung, thanks
2017-05-03T19:59:23 <Caren> jhung: the individual sessions during the event will need introducing. should we connect to discuss those?
2017-05-03T20:11:47 <Caren> jhung: here\xe2\x80\x99s a link to a doc that distills the afternoon script with elements pulled from the wiki https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oiy7V_vFY8GH-GUWux2uRhP-Kk_Wg1xnjxVlkLHbChM/edit?usp=sharing
