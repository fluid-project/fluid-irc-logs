2017-03-10T16:23:26 <danayo> Justin_o: one thought I had about the UIO tab - could the width of the tab expand to fill the space when it opens, and return to narrower tab when closed? so if it\'s pushing the panel space down, there won\'t be a visible gap, but it also won\'t get in the way of any other tabs when closed - maybe something we can discuss at the crit?

2017-03-10T19:44:04 <Jess__> dear all, none of you told me I was appearing as not myself in email (sort of like having something stuck between your teeth after lunch!) but the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrepancy\xe2\x80\x9d has been corrected and i am just \xe2\x80\x9cjess\xe2\x80\x9d once again and evermore ;)
2017-03-10T19:46:47 <alanharnum> Jess__: I missed any sign of this transformation myself, so it will remain a mystery to me!
2017-03-10T19:47:02 <Jess__> oh good! maybe it was just to new ppl.
2017-03-10T19:48:54 <alanharnum> the last emails i have from you (from Wednesday) are entirely normal in appearance
2017-03-10T19:55:29 <danayo> michelled: what do you think of creating a narrative this way? https://xd.adobe.com/view/b63b4316-3e8a-424f-90df-8d6f700f710d/
2017-03-10T19:56:07 <danayo> Jess__: I promise not to ever call you Jessica :)
2017-03-10T19:56:49 <michelled> danayo: I like it! will it work with a screen reader?
2017-03-10T19:57:05 <Jess__> danayo: you just did! doh!!
2017-03-10T19:57:08 <danayo> no michelled :( it\'s creating in XD. same issue with privacy prototype
2017-03-10T19:57:14 <danayo> *created
2017-03-10T19:57:19 <danayo> Jess__: oops!
2017-03-10T19:57:53 <danayo> unless we can hack it somehow michelled
2017-03-10T19:58:23 <michelled> danayo: can\'t wait until we make the design prototyping tools!
2017-03-10T19:58:32 <michelled> danayo: I think we\'d better hack it
2017-03-10T19:58:36 <danayo> YESSSS michelled
2017-03-10T19:58:50 <michelled> or else do a lower fidelity thing which plays nice with AT
2017-03-10T19:58:55 <danayo> if I remember correctly alanharnum had some ideas about hacking Adobe XD output
2017-03-10T19:59:08 <danayo> oh weird
2017-03-10T19:59:09 <danayo> XD
2017-03-10T19:59:16 <danayo> "XD" is an emoji, who knew
2017-03-10T19:59:20 <alanharnum> danayo: yup - never explored, but looked like it might be possible at a cursory glance
2017-03-10T19:59:31 * alanharnum raises his hand
2017-03-10T20:01:07 <danayo> alanharnum I\'m probably the only one who didn\'t know XD
2017-03-10T20:06:25 <danayo> alanharnum: how difficult do you think it would it be to build something like this (from scratch) using background images and simple buttons, that is keyboard accessible? https://xd.adobe.com/view/b63b4316-3e8a-424f-90df-8d6f700f710d/
2017-03-10T20:06:54 <danayo> say, if we could leave out any text entry fields to begin with
2017-03-10T20:07:16 <danayo> or other more complex interactions
2017-03-10T20:08:30 <michelled> danayo: I know we are at the tying up point of this project, but I thought you\'d find this interesting in that is shows how one group is trying to tell people how to maintain privacy when they are talking about something sensitive: https://www.revealnews.org/how-to-leak-to-the-center-for-investigative-reporting/

2017-03-10T20:10:18 <alanharnum> danayo: it wouldn\'t be too difficult - another AT issue I see looking at XD is that the image doesn\'t have good alt text (or presumably the ability to specify it), and the left-hand text itself is just part of the image, not text itself
2017-03-10T20:13:25 <danayo> thanks michelled
2017-03-10T20:13:54 <danayo> that\'s true alanharnum ... I guess we\'d have to use some combination of alt text with active and inactive buttons/links or something? it would probably get complicated fast

2017-03-10T21:07:48 <danayo> alanharnum: this prototype built with FramerJS is partially keyboard accessible (just the text fields and placeholder text, at least with VO) - I wonder if there is a way to make the buttons and content accessible as well http://share.framerjs.com/s41idfgjzj65/
2017-03-10T21:08:26 * gtirloni has quit
2017-03-10T21:19:40 <alanharnum> danayo: the generated HTML is pretty hairy - I can\'t even find out where things like the text are coming from at a quick glance
2017-03-10T21:20:23 <danayo> yeah alanharnum
2017-03-10T21:20:49 <alanharnum> i suspect that everything that\'s not interactive is a sliced up background image or similar
2017-03-10T21:25:46 <danayo> alanharnum: i\'m trying to remember the name of that interactive digital storytelling program - that allows you to build a simple branching story with text links...
2017-03-10T21:26:20 <alanharnum> danayo: Twine
2017-03-10T21:26:26 <danayo> THANK YOU XD
2017-03-10T21:29:15 * simonjb has quit
2017-03-10T21:31:23 <michelled> danayo: are you thinking of twine for the narrative gathering for SJRK?
2017-03-10T21:31:45 <danayo> michelled: I was thinking about the MyL3 narrative, but SJRK could be interesting!
2017-03-10T21:38:08 <michelled> yes to both!
