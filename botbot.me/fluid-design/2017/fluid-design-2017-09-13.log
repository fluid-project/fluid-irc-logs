2017-09-13T20:01:27 <Caren_> sepidehshahi and danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking alot about the terms Strengths and Needs (commonly used in context of kids in school). The terms seem to come from the medical or school environment and not from the kids/youth themselves. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant here but I wondered how kids would frame the idea behind Strenghts? Anecdotely from where I sit the words used are: Enjoy, Interest, Fun (hehe)

2017-09-13T20:05:23 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: this is a very important point you brought up.
2017-09-13T20:06:35 <sepidehshahi> I have heared many parents/teachers describe their kids/students with those words but you are right kids themselves see the world differently.
2017-09-13T20:11:29 <Caren_> I do understand that, for example, a child may love to work with numbers and a teacher/parent/guardian may be able to unpack what aspects of math is the trigger for engagement for that particular child. An adult\xe2\x80\x99s involvement may add nuance but the child is the primary driver of their so called \xe2\x80\x9cstrength\xe2\x80\x9d.
2017-09-13T20:11:59 <Caren_> I think ^
2017-09-13T20:14:33 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind I\xe2\x80\x99d like to add these to the community meeting notes. this is very interesting.

2017-09-13T13:50:23 <sepidehshahi> good morning alanharnum, do you know where I can find the MyL3 demo?
2017-09-13T13:51:10 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: there\'s a list of what\'s available at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Preference+Exploration+and+Self-Assessment
2017-09-13T13:54:20 <sepidehshahi> thanks alanharnum, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it on that page or on the build site. there was a working demo you had developed where you could enter data
2017-09-13T13:54:38 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: ah, I don\'t think that\'s one up anywhere unfortunately
2017-09-13T13:55:01 <sepidehshahi> ok no worries. thanks alanharnum
2017-09-13T14:00:13 <colinclark> alanharnum: Is it something we could post to the build site easily?
2017-09-13T14:00:37 <alanharnum> colinclark: I\'d have to look at the code, but I don\'t think it would be too hard
2017-09-13T14:00:58 <colinclark> cool
2017-09-13T14:01:12 <colinclark> probably worth doing, if only to have it easily referenceable

2017-09-13T15:01:34 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo, sepidehshahi: i\'m not sure if we needed anything for commenting, but I just saw this from Mozilla https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/09/06/mozilla-washington-post-reinventing-online-comments/
2017-09-13T15:02:40 <danayo> saw that Justin_o - sounds interesting. I don\'t fully get how it\'s different from regular commenting - more controlled I guess?
2017-09-13T15:03:06 <Justin_o> danayo: i wasn\'t too clear on that either.. i think maybe it\'s more about being able to filter things yourself easier

2017-09-13T15:55:44 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: I can send you the BiT proposal if it would help with some background information
2017-09-13T15:56:09 <colinclark> but danayo was spot on\xe2\x80\x94our goal tomorrow is to provide some background on some of the co-design techniques we\'ve used in other contexts
2017-09-13T15:56:33 <ussjoin> danayo Justin_o: FWIW, I know a few people who work for Coral, they have a lot of neat tech going into it. https://coralproject.net/
2017-09-13T15:57:08 <colinclark> So things like the Createathons, workshops we\'ve done, and so on
2017-09-13T15:57:31 <colinclark> the key is that Bodies in Translation has this vision of a "Knowledge Platform," but the specifics are still quite fuzzy
2017-09-13T15:57:52 <colinclark> they want the knowledge platform to connect up with the archive they will be building, which will capture the legacy of disability art in Canada
2017-09-13T15:58:05 <sepidehshahi> for sure colinclark. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting then.
2017-09-13T15:58:12 <colinclark> and is being done in association with the Journal of Disability Studies
2017-09-13T15:58:47 <colinclark> and then they want the platform to be a place where people can go to learn about the project, learn about non-normative visions of embodiment, the Canadian disability art community
2017-09-13T15:59:04 <colinclark> and Carla is quite interested also in resources being made available for instruction
2017-09-13T15:59:14 <colinclark> and particularly in disciplines that might not otherwise be arts-related
2017-09-13T15:59:47 <colinclark> so for example, a rehabilitation engineering professor might be able to use these teaching resources to help break out of the traditional "fix it," medical model of disability
2017-09-13T16:00:01 <colinclark> and to instead think of it as a continuum of identity and expression
2017-09-13T16:00:07 <colinclark> etc.
2017-09-13T16:00:39 <colinclark> Our job, with this first co-design session, is to start to help the BiT community bring together their different ideas for what the platform will be
2017-09-13T16:00:41 <sepidehshahi> very very interesting! thanks so much for the explanation, it\xe2\x80\x99s really helpful
2017-09-13T16:01:06 <colinclark> and so I can imagine we\'ll try to get them doing some creative and speculative activities to identify potential needs and requirements
2017-09-13T16:01:31 <colinclark> and also tell stories about their teaching, curatorial, and creative practices and how they might be supported by the platform
2017-09-13T16:01:39 <colinclark> I think it\'s going to be a lot of fun
2017-09-13T16:02:01 <colinclark> and because it\'s a different kind of audience, we can be a bit experimental and creative in our co-design tools
2017-09-13T16:02:08 <colinclark> we can try some new things out, I hope :)
2017-09-13T16:02:18 <sepidehshahi> totally! thanks colinclark
2017-09-13T16:02:27 <colinclark> i\'m looking forward to it!
2017-09-13T16:02:37 <sepidehshahi> me too :)
2017-09-13T16:02:49 <danayo> me three :) :) :)
2017-09-13T16:02:57 <danayo> thanks colinclark
2017-09-13T16:05:32 <danayo> thanks ussjoin. it says that Talk will "improve how people behave and interact in the comments space, and allow moderators to more easily identify and remove disruptive comments." just curious how exactly this will work
2017-09-13T16:06:27 <colinclark> danayo: Is it just me, or did you find there was something strangely uncomfortable about the Reveal band, based on the perspectives we\'ve discussed for MyL3?
2017-09-13T16:06:53 <colinclark> something that even the pictures spoke
2017-09-13T16:07:09 <ussjoin> danayo: I don\'t have deep tech insight to them, but a lot of their work is based around preventing sealioning and other GamerGater stuff. https://coralproject.net/research.html is interesting.
2017-09-13T16:07:24 <danayo> yeah colinclark, it reminded me of the Research Kit project/app
2017-09-13T16:07:39 <Caren_> colinclark, danayo, sepidehshahi and everyone: I\xe2\x80\x99m working on an entry for Createathons\xe2\x80\xa6It\xe2\x80\x99s WIP! Given your discussion here thought I\xe2\x80\x99d share my notes (some very point form trains of thought I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in incorporating). Feedback most welcome! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3eWo8YD7IXbVEWxHC6GmiczNGOJjT87-TR8bD26JF8/edit#heading=h.yft80ssqsa9i
2017-09-13T16:08:11 <danayo> I couldn\'t entirely put my finger on it colinclark, but I think the worry is related to behaviour "management"
2017-09-13T16:08:14 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-13T16:08:45 <colinclark> The pictures spoke to me, in terms of it being a child\'s bracelet, but the application with the all the analytics on it was running on a phone being held by adult hands
2017-09-13T16:08:55 <danayo> exactly, yeah
2017-09-13T16:09:15 <danayo> but they do mention eventually it becoming more about self-determination (altho they didn\'t quite put it that way)
2017-09-13T16:09:18 <danayo> independence
2017-09-13T16:09:49 <danayo> thanks Caren_!
2017-09-13T16:10:18 <danayo> looks like I need access permission Caren_
2017-09-13T16:11:01 <Caren_> danayo: sorry, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9csharable\xe2\x80\x9d link

2017-09-13T16:11:58 <colinclark> danayo: I can\'t shake the sense that you have to start from self-determination and move to the latter
2017-09-13T16:12:10 <colinclark> otherwise you\'ll never escape the in-built power dynamic
2017-09-13T16:12:33 <alanharnum> danayo colinclark: all of those "self-management" devices usually give the same twinge in me (at various degrees of intensity), which is the pronounced emphasis on individualism - it\'s the same problem I have with discourse around resilience and self-care
2017-09-13T16:12:46 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-13T16:12:49 <danayo> colinclark: I guess it\'s tricky when you\'re talking about young kids? but yes
2017-09-13T16:13:03 <colinclark> definitely tricky, but I guess that\'s the point
2017-09-13T16:13:14 <danayo> alanharnum:  can you say more about resilience and self-care?

2017-09-13T16:14:01 <michelled> I also felt very uncomfortable - partly with how they are determining stress - do we really think all humans show it in the same way?
2017-09-13T16:14:47 <danayo> colinclark: I could see it providing a useful auto-collection of data that could work with other things - and in a self-directed way - in that you\'d need to explore and learn what the indicators are, what is important for you to collect about yourself
2017-09-13T16:15:00 <colinclark> yes, totally
2017-09-13T16:15:01 <danayo> michelled alanharnum ^
2017-09-13T16:15:15 <colinclark> that\'s an interesting point, michelled
2017-09-13T16:15:42 <colinclark> about recognizing that there are a diversity of responses, and thus indicators
2017-09-13T16:16:00 <danayo> agree michelled - I guess it measures heart rate, sweat and body temp
2017-09-13T16:17:26 <colinclark> again, it would be interesting to offer ways to collect different types of indicators
2017-09-13T16:17:39 <colinclark> some quanitifiable, some qualified
2017-09-13T16:17:46 <michelled> yes, and I guess some of my concern would be in interpreting what those indicators mean
2017-09-13T16:17:46 <danayo> +1 colinclark
2017-09-13T16:17:48 <colinclark> and give people some ways to choose
2017-09-13T16:17:59 <alanharnum> danayo: basically, I\'m wary of things (tech, or whatever else) that push a dynamic of individual responsibility for coping under stressful societal contexts. i recognize the importance of coping strategies and the value of tools in surviving in contexts that are hostile to people on the margins, but i worry about how individualist discourse operates to conceal the problem of changing hostile aspects of society.
2017-09-13T16:18:00 <colinclark> and also some nice pre-made collections
2017-09-13T16:18:27 <jessm> michelled: reminds me of uppgivenhetssyndrom in Sweden \xe2\x80\x94 the kids have nothing \xe2\x80\x98medically wrong\xe2\x80\x99 https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/the-trauma-of-facing-deportation
2017-09-13T16:19:25 <michelled> good point alanharnum!
2017-09-13T16:21:14 <danayo> +1 alanharnum
2017-09-13T16:22:38 <danayo> jessm:  !
2017-09-13T16:22:44 <danayo> wow
2017-09-13T16:24:00 <michelled> interesting
2017-09-13T16:25:06 <Caren_> michelled: also reminds me of \xe2\x80\x9cinherited trauma\xe2\x80\x9d and not eveyone has a direct line to their biological history https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethical-wisdom/201606/it-didnt-start-you-the-mystery-inherited-trauma
2017-09-13T16:30:38 <sepidehshahi> very interesting discussion! colinclark I think there is not much detail provided on their site or in their promotional video, so we can\xe2\x80\x99t really say how it works. I noticed that they are working with a couple of parents and their kids. So, It\xe2\x80\x99d be great to hear from them, and find out how they have made those design decisions (both hardware, software).
