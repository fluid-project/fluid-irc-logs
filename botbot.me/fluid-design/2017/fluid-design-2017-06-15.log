2017-06-15T18:33:37 <grass> thank you
2017-06-15T18:40:24 <jhung> jessm, alanharnum, danayo, Caren - I have to run to the train\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll join when I\'m on the train.

2017-06-15T19:19:08 <jhung> Caren, alanharnum, danayo: Ooops. I was in the Fluid-work channel. I\'ll continue chatting in here.
2017-06-15T19:19:54 <jhung> Yeah. Donuts.
2017-06-15T19:20:50 <jhung> But I agree that the Try activities could be more interesting. Maybe keep the existing "Try" and add an example.
2017-06-15T19:21:10 <jhung> i.e. "Try writing a persona. For example imagine you were \xe2\x80\xa6."
2017-06-15T19:25:46 <jhung> Caren, alanharnum, danayo - this was actually fixed in work that is in progress. The way the sidebar behaves has been changed.
2017-06-15T19:26:17 <jhung> At least the way the sidebar behaves w UIO
2017-06-15T19:26:18 <jhung> yeah
2017-06-15T19:27:48 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m going to eat so will turn my camera off :-)
