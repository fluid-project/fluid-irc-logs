b'2017-11-16T20:05:23 <colinclark> that seems like such a bummer
2017-11-16T20:05:30 <colinclark> so many people made cool art with the Kinect

2017-11-16T20:06:33 <jhung> Mostly it was too expensive to make for a small market.

2017-11-16T20:09:15 <Justin_o> it\'s a shame the iPhone X costs so much though, but in a few years this tech will probably be everywhere
2017-11-16T20:13:56 <gmoss> re the discussion in the IDRC just now of photos of Asia, here\'s my instagram collection which has photos from a trip I took last October: https://www.instagram.com/blueslug/
2017-11-16T20:15:23 <colinclark> "a tool which is used for so many different applications, and is so ubiquitous, and has served crucially as a platform for so much creative experimentation, cultural progress, and secondary innovation, in so many different fields"
2017-11-16T20:15:30 <colinclark> really interesting
2017-11-16T20:20:13 <colinclark> excellent cat photos, gmoss
2017-11-16T20:23:39 <gmoss> thanks, colinclark! they\'re my little furry muses
2017-11-16T20:23:53 <colinclark> you and me both :)

2017-11-16T20:25:32 <colinclark> he\'s very happy
2017-11-16T20:25:40 <colinclark> just has a drippy eye, poor guy
2017-11-16T20:25:51 <grrrero> Haha yeah I thought he was crying
2017-11-16T20:25:58 <colinclark> he was a stray who lived in our friend\'s backyard for years
2017-11-16T20:26:00 <colinclark> in a little house
2017-11-16T20:26:15 <colinclark> they have seven cats, so they couldn\'t take another in
2017-11-16T20:26:19 <colinclark> seven cats!!
2017-11-16T20:27:15 <grrrero> Omg
2017-11-16T20:27:44 <grrrero> At what point were they like 7 is too much O_O
2017-11-16T20:28:08 <colinclark> I can\'t even imagine the psychology
2017-11-16T20:28:18 <colinclark> she\'s very involved in Toronto Cat Rescue
2017-11-16T20:28:24 <danayo> our neighbour in calgary had 8 cat
2017-11-16T20:28:25 <danayo> s
2017-11-16T20:28:28 <colinclark> and I guess sometimes it\'s really hard to let them go
2017-11-16T20:28:32 <colinclark> that\'s a lot of cats, danayo
2017-11-16T20:28:46 <danayo> yes, and he called them all in every morning at 5am for breakfast!
2017-11-16T20:28:53 <grrrero> awww danayo
2017-11-16T20:29:00 <danayo> Dreamer! Pumpkin! Cracker! Princess! etc
2017-11-16T20:29:07 <grrrero> So precious
2017-11-16T20:29:09 <grrrero> T_T
2017-11-16T20:29:21 <danayo> haha yes, except, well, at 5am it didn\'t seem precious
2017-11-16T20:29:26 <danayo> :)
2017-11-16T20:29:28 <grrrero> Hahaha true
2017-11-16T20:29:50 <grrrero> gmoss dat beer festival tho!!
2017-11-16T20:29:51 <gmoss> we had 6 cats growing up, it was a lot of work but a good number, the herd kind of took care of itself haha
2017-11-16T20:30:01 <danayo> wow
2017-11-16T20:30:16 <gmoss> grrrero: japanese beer festivals are a whole other scene from the ones here
2017-11-16T20:30:25 <grrrero> gmoss was that before or after you knew you couldn\'t have gluten
2017-11-16T20:30:33 * danayo has quit

b'2017-11-16T19:16:13 <gmoss> yep, I just tried again, making sure to wait for each reading to finish, and it didn\'t read that step
2017-11-16T19:16:53 <cindyli> ok. do you see anything special when the content is read or not read, gmoss
2017-11-16T19:17:13 <cindyli> such as, the mouse is hovering over a button
2017-11-16T19:17:36 <cindyli> or a tooltip is shown, etc
2017-11-16T19:19:12 <Caren_> danayo: sepidehshahi: you might be interested in the Barclay posts above ^
2017-11-16T19:19:13 <gmoss> cindyli: maybe there\'s something else at play that I haven\'t isolated yet. I\'m still getting no reading about 1/3 the time. In both cases, the "next ->" button is focused, the mouse cursor is on a different monitor to make sure there\'s no hover interaction. no tooltips are shown.
2017-11-16T19:19:46 <danayo> thanks Caren_
2017-11-16T19:20:01 <gmoss> (sorry Caren_ for drawing any attention away from your post!)
2017-11-16T19:20:32 <gmoss> and danayo this weather data visualisation is very neat!
2017-11-16T19:20:49 <Caren_> gmoss: not at all. I jumped in to the middle of it all!

2017-11-16T19:25:33 <cindyli> gmoss: this is the jira filter for first discovery tool issues: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2524?jql=project%20%3D%20GPII%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22First%20Discovery%22
2017-11-16T19:26:05 <cindyli> if the issue you described is not tracked, can you add it
2017-11-16T19:30:23 <Justin_o> cindyli, gmoss: sorry just getting caught up, what\'s wrong with the first discovery tool?

2017-11-16T19:30:31 * michelled has quit
2017-11-16T19:30:31 <grrrero> Hey hey danayo we\'re just waiting for everyone to get back to you re: Resources additions to SJRK website right?
2017-11-16T19:30:50 <danayo> that\'s right grrrero
2017-11-16T19:31:10 <grrrero> Cool danayo, do we have a deadline for this?
2017-11-16T19:32:27 <sepidehshahi> danayo: very interesting visualization. thanks for sharing
2017-11-16T19:32:34 <cindyli> Justin_o: colinclark wants to find a replacement for https://first-discovery.floeproject.org/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2017-11-16T19:32:38 <cindyli> he said: "I just want to be 100% sure that we\'ve got a replacement demo to link to, which doesn\'t involve a server, which shows off the full breadth of the First Discovery Tool"
2017-11-16T19:33:10 <cindyli> the current demo has the last page that displays the key returned by GPII
2017-11-16T19:33:17 <danayo> that\'s a good question grrrero. as I understand it, the sooner we submit our report to Oak, the sooner we get more money. and I think we\'d like to get it done by the end of November at the very latest. does that sound right colinclark?
2017-11-16T19:33:42 <Justin_o> cindyli: that link is broken for me
2017-11-16T19:34:07 <cindyli> i think the only difference with and without the server integration is having and not having the last page
2017-11-16T19:34:15 <cindyli> Justin_o: use "http" instead of "https"
2017-11-16T19:34:30 <grrrero> Cool, danayo, just wanted to know how asap this asap is :)
2017-11-16T19:34:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: ah okay.. safari doesn\'t like using http anymore
2017-11-16T19:34:54 <cindyli> ah ok, good and bad
2017-11-16T19:35:21 <Justin_o> i\'m having the same issue in chrome too.. it keeps trying to use https
2017-11-16T19:36:41 <Justin_o> anyways, i have it open now
2017-11-16T19:36:42 * michelled joined the channel
2017-11-16T19:37:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: so we want a first discovery demo but one that doesn\'t try to connect to the prefs server?
2017-11-16T19:37:59 <cindyli> Justin_o: does this demo only connect to the prefs server? i think it connects to the first discovery server than to the gpii cloud
2017-11-16T19:38:31 <cindyli> i think what colinclark means is not to have any of the server side
2017-11-16T19:38:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: it connects to the gpii prefs server through the first discovery server
2017-11-16T19:39:14 <Justin_o> cindyli: i believe it\'s because of the oauth security
2017-11-16T19:39:21 <cindyli> yes
2017-11-16T19:39:24 <Justin_o> which i guess you\'re in the process of  changing
2017-11-16T19:39:51 <cindyli> ya, this FD support at GPII has been removed in one of my branches
2017-11-16T19:40:10 <colinclark> Justin_o: To summarize the discussion above
2017-11-16T19:40:35 <colinclark> 1. That version of the FD Tool was just running in Alan\'s personal VM, so it wasn\'t being monitored or load balanced or anything
2017-11-16T19:40:43 <colinclark> 2. It\'s using an API that cindyli is in the midst of sunsetting
2017-11-16T19:40:58 <colinclark> 3. It was never a super compelling demonstration of GPII integration, from an end-user perspective
2017-11-16T19:41:28 <colinclark> 4. I just want to make sure that if we have one of the standalone versions of it available, that it shows all the features that this instance did (only with the that last GPII key page)
2017-11-16T19:41:32 <colinclark> does that make sense?
2017-11-16T19:42:01 <Justin_o> you mean without?
2017-11-16T19:42:07 <colinclark> oh yes
2017-11-16T19:42:08 <colinclark> typo
2017-11-16T19:42:15 <colinclark> "only without that last GPII key page"
2017-11-16T19:42:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: so the one on the build site https://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/
2017-11-16T19:42:37 <Justin_o> but it returns nothing on the last apge
2017-11-16T19:42:39 <Justin_o> page
2017-11-16T19:42:55 <colinclark> ok
2017-11-16T19:43:02 <colinclark> so that version is 100% identical to the server version?
2017-11-16T19:43:06 <Justin_o> we could also look into axing the last page
2017-11-16T19:43:25 <colinclark> on the link you sent me, I see "Congratulations!" as the last page
2017-11-16T19:43:31 <Justin_o> I think so, it\'s just not connected to anything server side, i believe
2017-11-16T19:43:38 <colinclark> why would we want to axe that?
2017-11-16T19:43:51 <Justin_o> oh yes.. sorry, i just hit to the type test and mistook it
2017-11-16T19:43:58 <Justin_o> clicked
2017-11-16T19:44:09 <colinclark> no problem :)
2017-11-16T19:44:29 <colinclark> ok, so as long as we\'re sure that the demo you linked to is the same, then let\'s just fully axe that server version
2017-11-16T19:44:30 <colinclark> remove links to it
2017-11-16T19:44:46 <colinclark> gtirloni has already stopped instance, as far as I know
2017-11-16T19:44:52 <colinclark> Does that seem viable, Justin_o?
2017-11-16T19:44:59 <Justin_o> i\'m pretty sure this is the same, because the other one has 12 steps including the gpii token, and this has 11 and essentially stops one page before
2017-11-16T19:45:15 <colinclark> ok, and no other differences or bug fixes?
2017-11-16T19:45:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: makes sense, but i wonder if we need to redirect the link
2017-11-16T19:45:37 <colinclark> that makes a ton of sense, yes :)
2017-11-16T19:46:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not 100% sure.. i don\'t know what version is running for the server demo.. i\'d imagine that the one on the build site should be the latest though, but we should confirm that from the ci i guess
2017-11-16T19:47:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: it looks like the latest commit to first-discovery  https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/commits/master was used to build what\'s on the build site
2017-11-16T19:48:00 <Justin_o> https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/first-discovery/14/
2017-11-16T19:49:03 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: I quickly scanned their inclusive design section. Their inclusive design section is interesting. there are similarities and differences. for example, we are trying to move away from personas and they are offering two sets of diverse personas in this section.
2017-11-16T19:49:10 <colinclark> ok, that\'s awesome, Justin_o!
2017-11-16T19:49:13 <colinclark> thank you
2017-11-16T19:49:28 <Justin_o> colinclark: :) no problem.. glad we had things relatively in place already
2017-11-16T19:49:40 <colinclark> so do you think we can indeed go ahead and say goodbye to this first discovery server demo?
2017-11-16T19:49:53 <colinclark> see ya later, little buddy
2017-11-16T19:50:15 <colinclark> and if so, who can put the redirect in place?
2017-11-16T19:51:02 <Justin_o> i think we can drop the demo.. especially if it won\'t work soon anyways.. the only thing i don\'t know is if we need it to show an prefs editor connecting to GPII..
2017-11-16T19:51:16 <Justin_o> don\'t know about the redirect, i\'d guess gio or alan
2017-11-16T19:51:32 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-11-16T19:51:32 <colinclark> I think it\'s fine\xe2\x80\x94we\'re going to have the Personal Settings Panel very soon
2017-11-16T19:51:49 <colinclark> and it will be fully integrated with the GPII and available in its installer and everything
2017-11-16T19:51:53 <Justin_o> sounded like that was coming by next week, so just around the corner
2017-11-16T19:51:57 <colinclark> so I think that will be a great demo
2017-11-16T19:51:59 <colinclark> yup, I hope so
2017-11-16T19:52:06 <danayo> PSP!
2017-11-16T19:52:09 <colinclark> Bosmon probably knows more about dates than me
2017-11-16T19:52:14 <colinclark> danayo: yes, now it\'s a PSP
2017-11-16T19:52:17 <danayo> :D
2017-11-16T19:52:21 <colinclark> So. Many. Acronyms.
2017-11-16T19:52:34 <colinclark> #notangeldust
2017-11-16T19:52:38 <colinclark> oh wait
2017-11-16T19:52:41 <colinclark> hashtags don\'t work here
2017-11-16T19:52:43 <Justin_o> colinclark, danayo: of course this is what i think of when i hear that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable
2017-11-16T19:52:45 <colinclark> they\'re channel names :)
2017-11-16T19:52:48 <danayo> haha
2017-11-16T19:52:49 <colinclark> who knows where that will go!
2017-11-16T19:52:50 <colinclark> eek
2017-11-16T19:53:10 <colinclark> hashtag not the same acronym as the current project, but without a letter
2017-11-16T19:53:23 <Justin_o> actually i wonder if there would be a trademark issue for that.. we may want to consider that if it\'s more than just an internal acronym
2017-11-16T19:53:25 <colinclark> hashtag not the playstation
2017-11-16T19:53:39 <danayo> I do like Personal Settings Panel
2017-11-16T19:54:00 <danayo> also I like how "PSP" sounds when you say it like a word
2017-11-16T19:54:02 <colinclark> Justin_o: Trademarks only apply to a particular domain or business sector
2017-11-16T19:54:12 <colinclark> so as long as we don\'t start making video game consoles
2017-11-16T19:54:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay cool, so we should be fine
2017-11-16T19:54:19 <colinclark> which would be awesome
2017-11-16T19:54:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: what if we integrate it into a video game console
2017-11-16T19:54:31 <danayo> hahaha Justin_o
2017-11-16T19:54:32 <Justin_o> that is, what if we were to onboard the xbox
2017-11-16T19:54:34 <colinclark> then that will be amazing, Justin_o
2017-11-16T19:54:46 <danayo> that will be amazing
2017-11-16T19:54:47 <colinclark> it\'s just a convenient acronym
2017-11-16T19:54:51 <colinclark> the name is the Personal Settings Panel
2017-11-16T19:54:58 <Justin_o> cool
2017-11-16T19:55:15 <colinclark> I met the product manager for the Xbox team the other week, Justin_o
2017-11-16T19:55:24 <Justin_o> consoles are basically computers these days, i think xbox runs windows 10 or some version of it.. so it\'s conceivable that we could do it at some point..
2017-11-16T19:55:25 <colinclark> she LOVED our work
2017-11-16T19:55:34 <colinclark> and wanted us to talk with the Xbox team about designing in communities
2017-11-16T19:55:35 <Justin_o> oh really
2017-11-16T19:55:44 <Justin_o> that\'s pretty awesome
2017-11-16T19:55:52 <colinclark> absolutely loved our co-design work, and how we design within the Fluid community
2017-11-16T19:56:06 <Justin_o> jhung1: ^
2017-11-16T19:56:15 <danayo> nice colinclark!
2017-11-16T19:58:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: by the way, this also made me think of another topic i wanted to chat with you about.. that is archiving old repos in github https://github.com/blog/2460-archiving-repositories
2017-11-16T19:58:14 <Justin_o> which they now support
2017-11-16T19:59:09 <Justin_o> it basically makes them readonly, and marks them as archived.. for us it would be the flagging as archived that is most relevant, just as an indicator that it isn\'t actively being developed anymore.
2017-11-16T19:59:19 <Justin_o> so in this case we could archive the first-discovery-server
2017-11-16T19:59:55 <Justin_o> anyways, if that seems reasonable i\'ll make proposal to the fluid-work list for the fluid-project repos
2017-11-16T20:01:41 <jhung1> colinclark, Justin_o - Maybe we can do some work into getting PhET sims onto XBOX Live? :D
2017-11-16T20:02:26 <Justin_o> jhung1: too bad they stopped producing kinect sensors.. it could have been interesting to have them paired up
2017-11-16T20:04:21 <jhung1> Justin_o: true. Maybe we can hack an iPhone X sensor to an Xbox using Nexus?
2017-11-16T20:04:30 <colinclark> can you bring them back in the future?
2017-11-16T20:04:34 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2017-11-16T20:04:46 <colinclark> what happened to the kinect?!
2017-11-16T20:04:54 <colinclark> I thought there was a new Xbox One version of it
2017-11-16T20:04:57 <colinclark> they killed it off?
2017-11-16T20:05:07 <jhung> colinclark: yep. Officially a couple weeks ago.
2017-11-16T20:05:12 <colinclark> :(
2017-11-16T20:05:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, you can unarchive a repo, and people can still fork it even if it is archived
2017-11-16T20:05:17 <colinclark> why, jhung?

2017-11-16T18:11:05 <danayo> Justin_o, gtirloni any idea why I can\'t connect to this link from the floeproject.org page? https://first-discovery.floeproject.org/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2017-11-16T18:11:43 <gtirloni> the service is down, apparently
2017-11-16T18:12:13 <gtirloni> oh no, it\'s up
2017-11-16T18:12:14 <gtirloni> http://first-discovery.floeproject.org/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2017-11-16T18:13:16 <gtirloni> we should probably move this behind HTTPS... but i\'d need some clarification on the importance of it, because right now this is running in an ad-hoc server in the development environment
2017-11-16T18:13:23 <gtirloni> it\'s not monitored, etc..
2017-11-16T18:13:42 <colinclark> it\'d be nice to have running
2017-11-16T18:14:03 <gtirloni> it\'s running on one of alan\'s personal VMs today
2017-11-16T18:14:07 <colinclark> there will come a point when we probably sunset it because of changes to how preferences editing tools will be integrated into the GPII
2017-11-16T18:14:08 <danayo> looks like it was a cache problem (it was happening in all browsers so I didn\'t think to check). Thanks gtirloni.
2017-11-16T18:14:16 <colinclark> ack, personal VMs :)
2017-11-16T18:14:26 <gtirloni> so it should be moved to production I assume
2017-11-16T18:14:36 <gtirloni> proper CI, monitoring, behind the load balancers, etc
2017-11-16T18:14:57 <colinclark> I can\'t remember precisely what this version of the FD tool demonstrates
2017-11-16T18:15:15 <colinclark> if I remember it\'s the version cindyli and Justin_o worked on immediately prior to IBM\'s "improvements"
2017-11-16T18:15:38 <colinclark> but what I don\'t fully remember is the nature of the integration with the GPII, and which parts it integrates with
2017-11-16T18:15:59 <colinclark> does it use a preferences server that we set up for this purpose? or does it attempt to connect, say, to preferences.gpii.net?
2017-11-16T18:16:10 <colinclark> these kinds of questions help a lot in terms of determining what we want to do with it
2017-11-16T18:16:20 <colinclark> we definitely need a good demo that shows off our work on the FD tool
2017-11-16T18:17:05 <gtirloni> it has its own preferences server, flow manager and couchdb database
2017-11-16T18:17:31 <michelled> colinclark: there are FD demos that don\'t connect to a server. look about half way down this page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Archive
2017-11-16T18:17:39 <colinclark> right
2017-11-16T18:17:42 <colinclark> ok
2017-11-16T18:17:47 <gtirloni> the container was created 22 months ago, no changes since then
2017-11-16T18:17:49 <colinclark> we run those ourselves, gtirloni?
2017-11-16T18:17:54 <colinclark> umm
2017-11-16T18:17:58 <colinclark> has the CouchDB instance been updated?
2017-11-16T18:18:03 <gtirloni> yes
2017-11-16T18:18:05 <colinclark> phew :)
2017-11-16T18:18:10 <gtirloni> yes, we run it ourselves
2017-11-16T18:18:14 <gtirloni> no, the couchdb has not been updated
2017-11-16T18:18:16 <colinclark> umm
2017-11-16T18:18:26 <colinclark> we should probably just take it down right away
2017-11-16T18:18:30 <gtirloni> it\'s only exposed locally to the prefs server
2017-11-16T18:18:34 <gtirloni> ok
2017-11-16T18:18:37 <colinclark> that\'s a good first step
2017-11-16T18:19:01 <colinclark> but it\'s such a brutal issue with CouchDB
2017-11-16T18:19:07 <gtirloni> re: the FDS, build date: 2015-12-23
2017-11-16T18:19:11 <cindyli> colinclark, gtirloni, i tried this demo, it does get tokens returned from GPII. i believe it very likely is using the proper workflow that Justin_o and I created: FD client -> FD server -> GPII cloud based flow manager
2017-11-16T18:19:36 <colinclark> cindyli: "tokens returned from GPII"
2017-11-16T18:19:41 <cindyli> if so, it will be using oauth client credentials grant support provided by GPII cloud
2017-11-16T18:19:50 <colinclark> but gtirloni is saying we have our own instance of the GPII, is that right?
2017-11-16T18:19:50 <cindyli> keys i meant
2017-11-16T18:19:56 <gtirloni> ok, i stopped the prefs server, flowmanager and couchdb on Alan\'s VM. does it still work?
2017-11-16T18:20:00 <colinclark> sorry, I wasn\'t correcting your use of the terminology
2017-11-16T18:20:03 <colinclark> I knew what you meant :)
2017-11-16T18:20:09 <cindyli> it might be collecting to flowmanager.gpii.net
2017-11-16T18:20:51 <cindyli> gtirloni: i don\'t know what Alan\'s VM is about
2017-11-16T18:20:52 <colinclark> michelled: So is the idea that this demo simply shows the integration with the GPII? Is it functionally different from the other demos, aside from that?
2017-11-16T18:21:16 <cindyli> typo. collecting should be "connecting"
2017-11-16T18:21:26 <gtirloni> cindyli: it runs this FDS instance, a prefs server, flow manager and couchdb
2017-11-16T18:21:35 <michelled> I think that\'s correct, cindyli, do you agree? it is the same FD tool, but it uses the prefs server
2017-11-16T18:22:06 <cindyli> ah ok. gtirloni: all inside Alan\'s VM?
2017-11-16T18:22:27 <gtirloni> yes
2017-11-16T18:22:35 <cindyli> michelled: i think it not only uses prefs server, but also uses first discovery server and cloud based flow manager
2017-11-16T18:23:13 <cindyli> gtirloni: if so, and if we\'d like to have this working being shown to the public, we probably wanna keep that VM running and keep that version of GPII
2017-11-16T18:23:31 <cindyli> i\'ve removed the first discovery suppport from GPII cloud in one of my branches
2017-11-16T18:24:00 <gtirloni> i can only imagine the number of vulnerabilities in it though, since the code is from 2015
2017-11-16T18:24:10 <cindyli> in detail, the support of oauth client credentials grant will be removed once my branch gets into the master
2017-11-16T18:24:27 <gtirloni> not only this service needs proper operations, someone needs to look at the code and build a new container then with updated dependencies
2017-11-16T18:24:38 <cindyli> gtirloni: i see
2017-11-16T18:24:51 <danayo> thanks for pointing out those other links michelled I\'ll use those instead (for SJRK Resources page)
2017-11-16T18:24:59 <colinclark> so, again, my question
2017-11-16T18:25:10 <colinclark> Can someone describe the functionality that is UNIQUE to this demonstration
2017-11-16T18:25:14 <colinclark> ?
2017-11-16T18:25:20 <colinclark> I\'d be happy to get rid of it
2017-11-16T18:25:34 <colinclark> I just don\'t want a case where there\'s, like, maybe a hot new enactor that won\'t be available elsewhere
2017-11-16T18:26:05 <colinclark> because, as you\'re saying, cindyli, this "integration" will soon be using APIs that we no longer support
2017-11-16T18:26:18 <colinclark> not much of a compelling integration in that case :)
2017-11-16T18:26:27 <cindyli> colinclark: if you open this link http://first-discovery.floeproject.org/demos/prefsServerIntegration/, click "next" button to the last page, a key will be displayed for the defined preferences to be used elsewhere
2017-11-16T18:26:32 <colinclark> but I just do want to make sure we\'ve got our best demonstration of the FD tool itself
2017-11-16T18:26:43 <colinclark> right
2017-11-16T18:26:49 <colinclark> but there are no other differences?
2017-11-16T18:26:52 <cindyli> no
2017-11-16T18:26:58 <colinclark> for sure? :)
2017-11-16T18:27:34 <cindyli> i\'m pretty sure. but since you asked\xe2\x80\xa6  Justin_o: what do you think
2017-11-16T18:27:47 <cindyli> :-P
2017-11-16T18:28:31 <cindyli> Justin_o might be on the way back from his lunch date ;)
2017-11-16T18:28:40 <colinclark> It\'s great when cindyli starts slinging Bosmon-esque sticky tongues
2017-11-16T18:28:48 <colinclark> we can wait for Justin_o whenever he gets back
2017-11-16T18:28:52 <colinclark> my sense is that it\'s time to sunset this demo
2017-11-16T18:29:15 <colinclark> I just want to be 100% sure that we\'ve got a replacement demo to link to, which doesn\'t involve a server, which shows off the full breadth of the First Discovery Tool
2017-11-16T18:30:00 * michelled has quit
2017-11-16T18:30:48 <cindyli> that would be whatever in there minus the last step
2017-11-16T18:30:51 <cindyli> i think
2017-11-16T18:31:05 <cindyli> let\'s wait for Justin_o to confirm
2017-11-16T18:32:06 <gmoss> cindyli, colinclark: i tested that demo out for keyboard navigation and to see if the built-in screen-reading capability was working as expected, and I found many cases where content was read only once, or not at all. hopefully that\'s helpful
2017-11-16T18:33:50 <cindyli> gmoss: i\'m a bit confused. when would you expect the content to be read more than once?
2017-11-16T18:34:12 <cindyli> and when was the content not read at all?
2017-11-16T18:36:20 <gmoss> cindyli: in the case that I accidentally hit tab while it was reading out the step number and description, and it focused on a button, then there was no evident way for me to "replay" the description of that step. I think perhaps this is why I thought the content was not read at all, I may have instinctively just hit "tab" right away in order to figure out where I was on the page
2017-11-16T18:36:52 <cindyli> ok, i see
2017-11-16T18:37:51 <cindyli> ya, once you hit the "tab", it will read whatever gets focus on
2017-11-16T18:38:13 <gmoss> there are also some interesting graphical artifacts if I\'m using keyboard-only navigation in Firefox 56
2017-11-16T18:39:01 <gmoss> I was using the up and down arrow keys to select whether to turn the voice on and off, and the tooltips that were displayed did not get hidden when I moved on to the next step
2017-11-16T18:39:52 <gmoss> is there a way to "reset" the preferences so I can run through it again?
2017-11-16T18:40:26 <cindyli> ya, there were some issues with tooltips as i rmb. our issue tracker should have jiras for some
2017-11-16T18:40:35 * gtirloni wonders what Justin_o is having for lunch
2017-11-16T18:41:26 <cindyli> gtirloni: 4 or 5 courses, haha
2017-11-16T18:41:37 <gtirloni> now i\'m hungry :)
2017-11-16T18:41:51 <cindyli> gmoss: ctr + option + r to reset
2017-11-16T18:41:58 <gmoss> thanks, cindyli!
2017-11-16T18:42:04 <cindyli> np
2017-11-16T18:42:18 <gmoss> (ctrl + alt + r in windows ;))
2017-11-16T18:42:34 <cindyli> good to know ;)
2017-11-16T18:42:56 <gmoss> hmm yeah in Chrome, if i use the keyboard for nav, it doesn\'t read the second step
2017-11-16T18:43:33 <cindyli> gmoss: the 2nd step means the 2nd welcomepage?
2017-11-16T18:58:35 * Caren_ joined the channel
2017-11-16T19:03:20 <danayo> fluid-everyone: interesting weather station data collection project using Raspberry Pi and Initial State https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/initial-state/
2017-11-16T19:04:55 <Caren_> Great talk on #ID24 this morning had me exploring Barclays inclusive design and accessibility: https://www.barclayscorporate.com/insight-and-research/managing-your-business/making-your-business-accessible.html
2017-11-16T19:05:31 <Caren_> and here\xe2\x80\x99s the talk: From accessibility compliance to inclusive design \xe2\x80\x94 David Caldwell: #ID24 Nov 2017 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sizmd3UGWSE&list=PLn7dsvRdQEfGvHBILiQDsrkVf3oo0-shO&index=13
2017-11-16T19:08:06 <Caren_> David talked about the fact that regulated means there is always an element of \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to\xe2\x80\x9d but their mandate is to move away from DDA (UK) compliance to what is the best most inclusive experience we can create for customers.
2017-11-16T19:12:07 <gmoss> cindyli:  sorry, I got caught up in a discussion with simonjb. Yes, the second welcome page, i.e. Step 2 of 12
2017-11-16T19:14:17 <cindyli> gmoss: tried in chrome. it reads the content
2017-11-16T19:15:17 <gmoss> cindyli: hm, it does seem to work now, I\'ll see if I can reproduce the issue. I\'ve seen it not read it twice, but perhaps I was being too hasty
2017-11-16T19:16:05 <Caren_> There might be some interesting stuffs for BigIdea. Worth a wade through. They have external resources and the organization and clarity is quite good IMO.
