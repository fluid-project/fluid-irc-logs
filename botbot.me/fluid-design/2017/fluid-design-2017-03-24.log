2017-03-24T13:43:36 <jhung> hey danayo
2017-03-24T13:44:15 <danayo> saw that you were planning a crit for the OER work - not sure when you were planning to do it but just wanted to make sure we can fit in the privacy prototype review at next week\xe2\x80\x99s crit
2017-03-24T13:44:59 <jhung> danayo: that crit is a different crit and at a different time.
2017-03-24T13:45:09 <jhung> we will stil have the regular crit on Tuesdays.
2017-03-24T13:45:14 <danayo> ok great jhung
2017-03-24T13:45:37 <danayo> thanks
2017-03-24T13:45:57 <jhung> So next week I'll put Privacy Prototype into the schedule? Let me know if there are any links / docs / artifacts danayo
2017-03-24T13:46:13 <danayo> perfect thanks jhung

2017-03-24T13:55:36 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung do you have a few minutes now to talk about some UIO stuff
2017-03-24T13:55:58 <jhung> sure Justin_o
2017-03-24T13:55:59 <danayo> Justin_o: I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk right now, but I can ping

2017-03-24T14:10:12 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: there were two things i wanted to chat about 1) for the steppers should the focus styling go around only the buttons and textfield, or should it also go around the icons.. e.g big a and little a, linespacing icons.. 2) haven't been able to find a solution for to line up the switches... jhung had the suggestion of having those panels have the
2017-03-24T14:10:12 <Justin_o> text and switch in side-by-side columns instead of stacked vertically.
2017-03-24T14:11:26 <danayo> Justin_o: in the same way that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t putting focus around the on/off labels, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should put focus around the icons
2017-03-24T14:14:31 <jhung> danayo: putting focus only around the text area makes sense. It makes it clear what is being interacted with using keyboard.
2017-03-24T14:15:36 * gtirloni_ is now known as gtirloni
2017-03-24T14:16:09 <Justin_o> while you guys debate that, should the up/down arrows work only when on the textfield or anywhere in the stepper, so if they click a button should the up/down arrows also work there
2017-03-24T14:16:15 <danayo> jhung: by text area, you mean buttons + text field? or did I misunderstand?
2017-03-24T14:18:02 <danayo> Justin_o: I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the last part of your question - \xe2\x80\x9cif they click a button should the arrows work there\xe2\x80\x9d
2017-03-24T14:18:35 <danayo> as long as focus is on the adjuster, the arrows shoud be able to control the value
2017-03-24T14:22:14 <jhung> Up and down should only work in the text field I think Justin_o.

2017-03-24T14:29:49 <Justin_o> danayo: so i mean if i use the mouse to click on the buttons, but then hit the arrow keys without moving focus, should the up/down arrow keys work.. or only when the user is explicitly in the textfield
2017-03-24T14:36:14 * danayo thinking
2017-03-24T14:40:19 <danayo> Justin_o:  so I think we\xe2\x80\x99re saying that if I just click one of the +/- buttons, focus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t land on the stepper, in which case, the arrrow keys would not be functional. but if I click on the text field, focus lands on the stepper, and I can use the arrow keys - I think this makes sense
2017-03-24T14:40:52 <danayo> sorry, I know this would be easier if we could actually talk :p
2017-03-24T14:40:55 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: okay, cool thanks... that's how i have it working right now, but wanted to double check
2017-03-24T14:41:19 <danayo> great Justin_o
2017-03-24T14:53:33 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: i've sent out another screenshot of the switch adjuster but this time in columns.
2017-03-24T14:53:42 <Justin_o> i'll be heading offline soon, but please let me know what you think
2017-03-24T14:55:20 <jhung> ok Justin_o
2017-03-24T14:55:37 <Justin_o> thanks, talk to you later
