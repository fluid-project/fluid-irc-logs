2017-08-22T15:22:53 <jhung> danayo: did you have a chance to look over the "Introduction to UI Options" wiki page? Do you have any feedback?
2017-08-22T15:23:38 <danayo> jhung: i\'m sorry I haven\'t yet! I am going to do that right after this!
2017-08-22T15:24:03 <jhung> awesome danayo. Thanks!

2017-08-22T17:14:57 <danayo> hi jhung, sorry for the delay - I copied the content over to a google doc and made some suggested edits here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nzx8BeHv28BpUdupnXyQprbNdnx1Ga9NWRXqKcHt00o/edit?usp=sharing
2017-08-22T17:15:41 <danayo> I\'m happy to incorporate right into the wiki if you like - but wanted you to take a look first
2017-08-22T17:16:46 <jhung> Awesome Dana! Let\'s keep it in the Google doc for now. I\'ll be meeting w Avtar later so this could be handy. I\'ll migrate it over later.
2017-08-22T17:16:54 <danayo> ok
2017-08-22T17:17:00 <jhung> This is really good. Thanks so much danayo!
2017-08-22T17:17:31 <danayo> no problem jhung!

2017-08-22T20:10:35 <jhung> hi grrrero. Thanks for the feedback on the feedback-post-plugin. I\'m happy to see you got it running with little help from me. :) Did you have a chance to look at the code?
2017-08-22T20:10:45 <jhung> btw I\'m going to take a look at that styling issue now.
2017-08-22T20:10:53 <grrrero> jhung: Yeah I did! It looks good to me
2017-08-22T20:11:09 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-22T20:13:41 <jhung> awesome grrrero. Thanks!
2017-08-22T20:30:41 <Jess_> jhung: ping
2017-08-22T20:30:48 * cindyli1 has quit
2017-08-22T20:35:53 <jhung> Jess_: pong
2017-08-22T20:36:25 <Jess_> jhung: i am so far behind on email :( and i haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to you in ages :( anything i need to bump to the top of my list?
2017-08-22T20:36:51 <Jess_> danayo: this goes for you too! I see a lot of SJRK emails from you and alan I have to get to
2017-08-22T20:37:27 <danayo> Hello Jess_ ! welcome back
2017-08-22T20:37:37 <Jess_> thx!
2017-08-22T20:37:48 <jhung> Jess_: nothing burning at the moment if that\'s what you\'re wondering. :)
2017-08-22T20:38:03 <danayo> i\'m thinking it would probably be easiest to just meet with alanharnum and I when you have a chance - mabye tomorrow? we can catch you up
2017-08-22T20:38:14 <Jess_> i didn\xe2\x80\x99t even click on the DEEP colour email yet jhung but i suspect you\xe2\x80\x99re a hero again
2017-08-22T20:38:25 <Jess_> danayo: that sounds excellent!
2017-08-22T20:38:57 <danayo> it\'s a plan Jess_
2017-08-22T20:40:00 <jhung> Jess_: Yeah, that was a quick fix. I wish more issues were like that. :) I guess the big thing is related to the various wordpress projects. There was a meeting to figure out priorities last Friday. michelled may have to help fill you in on the details as I was in a PhET meeting at the time.
2017-08-22T20:40:31 <Jess_> ah, ok
2017-08-22T20:42:31 <michelled> Jess_: Vera, Lisa, Julia and I met about Snow - apparently there is a report due in September and they were hoping to have the new site up by then. I doubt it\'s feasible given the extremely short timeline
2017-08-22T20:42:57 <Jess_> michelled: ah, that is short!
2017-08-22T20:43:04 <michelled> indeed :)
2017-08-22T20:43:24 <michelled> Jess_: most likely grrrero will build the new site when she is done with her current UIO tasks
2017-08-22T20:43:56 <Jess_> michelled: does the building of that site bring up the larger WP convo re: sites?
2017-08-22T20:44:24 <michelled> the plan is to use the same theme jhung has created for BIGIDeA
2017-08-22T20:44:31 <michelled> so it should be minimal work to make the site
2017-08-22T20:44:42 <michelled> the larger issue still needs to be addressed
2017-08-22T20:45:06 <Jess_> michelled: the larger issue being how to maintain, reuse, and support jhung \xe2\x80\x99s theme in WP?
2017-08-22T20:45:07 <michelled> and gtirloni and alanharnum should be involved when we tackle it
2017-08-22T20:45:15 <Jess_> ah, yes
2017-08-22T20:45:32 <michelled> yes, plus all the other WP sites we currently host and maintain
2017-08-22T20:45:49 <michelled> this is a common theme for us :) with so many projects, it\'s not at all surprising that this comes up
2017-08-22T20:46:00 <Jess_> yeah \xe2\x80\x94 a huge opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 a daunting one
2017-08-22T20:46:23 <Jess_> ok, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to grab a shovel and start diving into emails! wish me luck!
2017-08-22T20:46:30 <michelled> good luck!
2017-08-22T20:47:41 <Jess_> :P
2017-08-22T20:51:19 <Jess_> Justin_o: ! eek \xe2\x80\x94 I meant to ask you too\xe2\x80\xa6 is there anything actionable wrt new coop students? Have you heard from Pak?
2017-08-22T20:54:08 <jhung> Jess_: I think Justin_o has signed off for the day. We\'re seeing his ghost here\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-08-22T20:54:41 <Jess_> ohhh, ghost of justin_o
2017-08-22T20:54:50 <Jess_> ok, jhung i\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him tomorrow\xe2\x80\xa6 no hurry
2017-08-22T20:54:59 <clown> Justin_o:  go haunt some other IRC channel, willya?
2017-08-22T20:55:15 <Jess_> clown: that\xe2\x80\x99s rich, coming from a clown!
2017-08-22T20:55:53 <clown> clowns haunt?  I thought the prat-falled.
2017-08-22T20:57:59 <clown> or juggled.
2017-08-22T21:01:22 <Jess_> :)
2017-08-22T21:03:53 <clown> Jess_:  BOO!
