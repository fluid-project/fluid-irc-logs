2017-07-06T20:00:38 <colinclark> It's really beautiful work, Caren
2017-07-06T20:00:51 <colinclark> you have made a nice visual world for the reader
2017-07-06T20:00:53 <Caren> thanks for that
2017-07-06T20:01:21 <colinclark> and I like the dog sitting in the grass
2017-07-06T20:01:22 <colinclark> :)
2017-07-06T20:01:47 <colinclark> in fact the grass motif throughout is really appealing
2017-07-06T20:02:21 <Caren> ha! a dog or cat always makes it better :-)
2017-07-06T20:03:21 <danayo> Caren: I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly out today but dropping in here and there, would love to see what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got! email me the png?
2017-07-06T20:03:47 <Caren> for sure, danayo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that now.
2017-07-06T20:03:52 <danayo> thanks!
2017-07-06T20:11:38 <danayo> Caren: it\xe2\x80\x99s looking really great!! so cool to see where you got it to from when we last spoke - and I agree with all of colinclark\xe2\x80\x99s feedback
2017-07-06T20:12:34 <Caren> thanks for taking the time to look at it, danayo.
2017-07-06T20:12:58 <danayo> my pleasure Caren!
2017-07-06T20:13:04 <Caren> there have been lots of iterations for sure. but it feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good place
2017-07-06T20:13:10 <danayo> definitely
2017-07-06T20:14:06 <danayo> glad there are no hearts being ripped out :D, at least, visually :D
2017-07-06T20:15:00 <danayo> really like what you did with the opening sequence
2017-07-06T20:15:30 <Caren> haha\xe2\x80\xa6the heart. the heart.
2017-07-06T20:16:21 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m going offline for 20 mins. any further feedback send me in email if you can. thanks thanks

2017-07-06T14:57:20 <Justin_o> do you have an idea for a name
2017-07-06T14:57:32 <Justin_o> it\'s essentially a custom radio button
2017-07-06T14:58:16 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure if we should call it radio group adjuster because we might have plain ones later, but not sure that it matters
2017-07-06T15:00:17 <Justin_o> maybe i\'ll just call it styledRadioAdjuster because the "preview" aspect is kind of a big piece.

2017-07-06T15:28:59 <jhung> Justin_o: hmmm good question. Naming things isn\'t usually my strength as I typically call things as they are. "styledRadioGroupWithPreview" would be my first attempt. :)

2017-07-06T17:52:38 <jhung> Justin_o: looks okay. It doesn\'t imply anything about its ability to do the preview though.
2017-07-06T17:53:16 <Justin_o> hoping the the "Styled" part suggests that... maybe i should call it themed instead of styled
2017-07-06T17:55:34 <jhung> "styled" sounds passive as does "theme". not sure what else I\'d recommend though.

I\xe2\x80\x99m just about ready to send off the Platform Co-op for a final review before converting it into an accessible PDF (including dbl checking colours) and delivering. Can I send you a PNG to have a glance before I send it off. The ending is visually flat. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to break the content apart but there is no room to expand. Perhaps someone might ha
2017-07-06T18:59:44 <Caren> some brillant ideas! :-)

2017-07-06T19:34:22 <colinclark> Caren: It\'s such a great brochure :)
2017-07-06T19:34:29 <colinclark> I can\'t quite call it an infographic
2017-07-06T19:34:33 <colinclark> it\'s a brochure
2017-07-06T19:34:37 <colinclark> and it looks so awesome
2017-07-06T19:34:54 <colinclark> I have a few very minor points
2017-07-06T19:35:08 <colinclark> there\'s something about the nature of the line drawings that I noticed
2017-07-06T19:35:31 <colinclark> It\'s interesting to compare the imagery in the first two pages to the ones later in the document
2017-07-06T19:35:45 <colinclark> they start out looking very thin and sketchy
2017-07-06T19:36:27 <colinclark> but I find it a bit more inviting and polished when you use thicker line strokes and more striking contrast
2017-07-06T19:36:49 <colinclark> but perhaps these just signify icons you\'re still working on, I\'m not sure
2017-07-06T19:37:08 <colinclark> so for example, the vacuum in on the first page vs. the same vacuum on the last page
2017-07-06T19:38:01 <colinclark> or the difference between the "imbalanced guy in a tie on a see saw" icon vs. the icons on the "benefits of the co-op model" page
2017-07-06T19:38:25 <colinclark> where you\'ve got a thicker stroke and coloured (as opposed to thin black) outlines
2017-07-06T19:38:51 <colinclark> I think it wouldn\'t hurt to have an IDRC logo down on the last page if you can squeeze it in an attractive way
2017-07-06T19:39:01 * Caren_ joined the channel
2017-07-06T19:40:55 <Caren> ah, interesting observation about the line art. In some cases they are more of a tone on tone for contrast balance purposes. I will look closer at them from the perspective you\xe2\x80\x99ve noted.
2017-07-06T19:41:26 <colinclark> I think it will give them a more polished and approachable feel if you play a bit with stroke weight and colour
2017-07-06T19:41:32 <Caren> The last graphic of the phone with icons is a bit of an anomoly in it\xe2\x80\x99s rendering. I am going to look at that for sure.
2017-07-06T19:41:49 <colinclark> I love the "...and there are many more co-ops" table
2017-07-06T19:41:50 <Caren> But do you think the visual narrative is clear?
2017-07-06T19:41:51 <colinclark> it looks so nice
2017-07-06T19:41:59 <colinclark> yes, the visual narrative is entirely clear
2017-07-06T19:42:29 <colinclark> That table is so nice because of its conscious asymmetry
2017-07-06T19:42:45 <Caren> oh, good eye :-)
2017-07-06T19:43:01 <Caren> question:
2017-07-06T19:43:14 <colinclark> you know, I think the section above could do with some inspiration from that visual theme, though
2017-07-06T19:43:38 <colinclark> those "tacked on pages" have a slightly funny vibe in comparison to the rest of the document
2017-07-06T19:43:55 <colinclark> they look flat, because again of the thin black stroke and the gradient
2017-07-06T19:44:26 <colinclark> i wonder if they could be slightly more playful by echoing some of the stylistics elsewhere, like the illustrated tree for example
2017-07-06T19:44:29 <colinclark> sorry, yes, ask you question
2017-07-06T19:44:35 <colinclark> I\'m done with my thoughts for now
2017-07-06T19:44:41 <colinclark> :)
2017-07-06T19:45:36 <Caren> good point about the case studies. They\xe2\x80\x99re a challenge with all the content.
2017-07-06T19:46:13 <colinclark> yes, understandably
2017-07-06T19:46:34 <Caren> My question is which of the line drawings do you feel are a more sophisticated rendering
2017-07-06T19:46:49 <Caren> the black thinner lines?
2017-07-06T19:46:59 <colinclark> no, the other ones
2017-07-06T19:47:15 <colinclark> ones that use a thicker stroke and perhaps some colour
2017-07-06T19:47:20 <Caren> ah, yes, the tone on tone so to speak
2017-07-06T19:47:23 <colinclark> yup
2017-07-06T19:47:34 <colinclark> I think the tone on tone is what\'s missing, too, from the case studies
2017-07-06T19:48:03 <Caren> yes, for sure.
2017-07-06T19:48:16 <colinclark> it feels like we suddenly enter "flat land" or "wireframe world" instead of the visual universe you\'ve created elsewhere
2017-07-06T19:48:26 <colinclark> understably, since we\'ve got all that text
2017-07-06T19:48:49 <Caren> ha\xe2\x80\xa6sort of like
2017-07-06T19:48:53 <Caren> brutalism
2017-07-06T19:49:02 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-07-06T19:49:05 <colinclark> not brutalism
2017-07-06T19:49:22 <colinclark> just like the difference between a comic book and a pencil drawing, perhaps
2017-07-06T19:49:35 <colinclark> made with a very hard, thin pencil :)
2017-07-06T19:50:08 <Caren> In another world that could be a cool combo
2017-07-06T19:50:19 <colinclark> not like a nice soft H pencil where you can use the side of the pencil for weight and texture
2017-07-06T19:50:22 <colinclark> :)
2017-07-06T19:50:25 <Caren> if done intentionally
2017-07-06T19:50:28 <colinclark> yes, it could be very cool
2017-07-06T19:50:29 <Caren> :-)

2017-07-06T19:51:30 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m going to step away to clear my head then come back at it.
2017-07-06T19:51:45 <colinclark> Well, one thing I should have said first, Caren:
2017-07-06T19:51:49 <Caren> thanks for the 5-min crit
2017-07-06T19:51:51 <colinclark> This is really, really good as-is
2017-07-06T19:51:53 <Caren> awesome
2017-07-06T19:51:56 <colinclark> you could ship this right this second
2017-07-06T19:52:00 <colinclark> and it would be lovely
2017-07-06T19:52:04 <colinclark> perfectly suitable
2017-07-06T19:52:24 <colinclark> so any of my thoughts are just in context of things you could, if you want to, now or someday in the future, think about
2017-07-06T19:52:35 <colinclark> not things you actually need to do today :)
2017-07-06T19:52:44 <Caren> Ha,
2017-07-06T19:52:55 <Caren> ok. That\xe2\x80\x99s good context.
2017-07-06T19:53:10 <Caren> but there may be some very simple and quick things I can do to just tweak
2017-07-06T19:53:14 <colinclark> yes
2017-07-06T19:53:21 <colinclark> If it were me, I\'d be in the simple tweaking phase at this point
2017-07-06T19:53:36 <colinclark> it has such a great feeling and flow and visual identity
2017-07-06T19:53:41 <Caren> yes, agree. for sure
2017-07-06T19:53:51 <colinclark> and I learned quite a lot from it
2017-07-06T19:53:51 <Caren> tweaking phase
2017-07-06T19:54:13 <colinclark> I do miss the image of the hand ripping the heart of the economy, though
2017-07-06T19:54:13 <colinclark> :P
2017-07-06T19:54:15 <Caren> The communication of the content/meaning is the most imp
2017-07-06T19:54:24 <Caren> hahahah...snort
2017-07-06T19:54:38 <colinclark> :)
2017-07-06T19:54:55 <colinclark> that first statistic is incredibly powerful
2017-07-06T19:55:03 <colinclark> and conveys all the violence necessary, without the violent imagery
2017-07-06T19:55:27 <colinclark> "the 62 richest people in the world controlled $1.76 trillion: the cumulative worth of 3.5 billion people."
2017-07-06T19:55:32 <Caren> sure is: In 2015, the  richest people in the world controlled $1.76 trillion: the cumulative worth of 3.5 billion people.
2017-07-06T19:55:36 <colinclark> unbelievable
2017-07-06T19:55:52 <Caren> so wrong
2017-07-06T19:55:58 <colinclark> It\'s interesting that all this wealth is consolidated in a very small set of activities
2017-07-06T19:56:14 <colinclark> mostly technology, hedge funds, luxury good, retail
2017-07-06T19:57:57 <Caren> and its a perpetuation
2017-07-06T19:58:45 <Caren> luxury goods is huge
2017-07-06T19:59:47 <Caren> thanks again. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on next iteration I send out.
