2017-01-23T19:42:10 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Does anyone have anything for tomorrow's design crit? With the regular IDRC planning meeting moved to Tuesday, we miss the opportunity to discuss potential topics.
2017-01-23T19:42:58 * gtirloni has quit
2017-01-23T19:43:29 <Justin_o> jhung: hmmm.. i might want to chat with something related to where the styling for components used in the prefs framework should live. But i'm not sure this is necessarily a good topic for the design crit
2017-01-23T19:46:09 * amatas has quit
2017-01-23T20:05:45 <jhung> Justin_o: it seems like something for the mailing list or IRC? Maybe start on IRC to be hashed out there then on List for consensus?
2017-01-23T20:06:40 <Justin_o> :(
2017-01-23T20:07:06 <Justin_o> well part of the problem is that the textfieldslider's styling is all in the prefs framework, even though it is it's own component.
2017-01-23T20:07:12 <Justin_o> so there are no default styles for it
2017-01-23T20:07:17 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2017-01-23T20:08:18 <Justin_o> so we could move the styles to the component, but how will this affect how users make use of the styles for the prefs framework, which are currently all together.
2017-01-23T20:10:46 <jhung> Justin_o: good question. I'm not too familiar with how it's structured currently, but from the sounds of it there are 2 issues\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-01-23T20:11:11 <jhung> 1. There are no default styles for texfieldslider.
2017-01-23T20:11:41 <jhung> 2. If we move the styles, it may affect how people have used it previously.
2017-01-23T20:11:47 <jhung> Is that correct?

2017-01-23T20:22:06 <cindyli> simonjb: I wrote a wiki page to collect the research I did for approaches to protect the communication btw local flow manager and the cloud - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Continued_Researches_on_Possible_Approaches_for_Protecting_Communication_btw_LFM_and_CBFM. i wonder if you wanna read it when you have time and give some opinions?
2017-01-23T20:24:42 <simonjb> thanks cindyli, I will take a look
2017-01-23T20:24:52 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2017-01-23T21:07:47 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, and it may make things a bit more difficult for those using it from NPM because they'll have to source css from both the dist directory and the src.
2017-01-23T21:11:34 <jhung> Justin_o: having 2 copies is not ideal, nor do I think moving the CSS is a solution. There's no alternative?
