2017-08-04T14:45:04 <grrrero> jhung, Justin_o: Any ideas on where to store the .ai actions for e.g. scaling icons in Adobe Illustrator?
2017-08-04T14:45:09 * michelled has quit
2017-08-04T14:50:02 <Justin_o> grrrero: can you remind me, are they things that can be shared? or is it more about documentation?
2017-08-04T14:50:03 <jhung> grrrero: good question. I wonder if it should go into a new repo?
2017-08-04T14:50:39 * pratik_r joined the channel
2017-08-04T14:52:28 <grrrero> Justin_o: I\'m doing up the documentation right now, and I just realised what would happen if there was a new whole batch of icons that one wanted to add into the master .ai file -- jhung any thoughts on how a batch process would look/feel like for when you\'d ever add a new bunch of them in?
2017-08-04T14:53:03 <grrrero> Justin_o: To answer your question, if I am able to create an action that helps with the batch processing, then definitely that should be shared to make everyone\'s process easier
2017-08-04T14:54:19 * Caren_ joined the channel
2017-08-04T14:56:58 <Justin_o> grrrero: if it\'s something that can be shared and just imported, then it can probably be added to the svg repo
2017-08-04T14:57:44 * Caren_ has quit
2017-08-04T14:57:53 <grrrero> Justin_o: Sounds good; I found that Adobe Illustrator has built-in scripts specifically for batch, I think -- might take a closer look at that, and then when I get it working will add it to the repo
2017-08-04T14:58:17 <Justin_o> cool

2017-08-04T15:24:43 <alanharnum> possibly of interest: http://joss.theoj.org/about
2017-08-04T15:25:57 <alanharnum> "The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is a developer friendly journal for research software packages."
2017-08-04T15:26:31 <alanharnum> basically, as far as I can tell, an attempt to hack the issues with tenure, reputation and promotion that academics who work on producing open source software run into
2017-08-04T15:30:12 <grrrero> Also possibly of interest! Airbnb\'s design team created a toolkit for inclusive design https://airbnb.design/anotherlens/
2017-08-04T15:51:44 <colinclark> alanharnum: very, very curious
2017-08-04T15:53:41 <colinclark> grrrero: Also very very interesting :)
2017-08-04T15:54:16 <colinclark> I\'m fascinated in particular by the perspective these kinds of artefacts take
2017-08-04T15:54:52 <colinclark> I\'m struggling to precisely describe what is interesting to me about Another Lens
2017-08-04T15:55:33 <colinclark> a lens is an interesting metaphor
2017-08-04T15:55:49 <colinclark> since it starts to lead to the question "who\'s doing the looking, and who\'s being looked at?"
2017-08-04T15:55:57 <grrrero> colinclark: Very good point
2017-08-04T15:56:17 <colinclark> and I\'m pretty impressed with the way they are really trying to teach designers to view their designs from multiple perspectives
2017-08-04T15:56:39 <colinclark> but I keep thinking, maybe we should also pass the looking glass to someone else?
2017-08-04T15:56:40 <colinclark> :)
2017-08-04T15:57:13 <colinclark> and then the resource becomes something different\xe2\x80\x94rather than focused on an audience of designers who continue to design for others who are different from them
2017-08-04T15:57:16 <grrrero> I agree with that; they mentioned that while it was firstly developed for designers, anyone can apply these to their own work
2017-08-04T15:57:21 <colinclark> right
2017-08-04T15:57:23 <colinclark> and that\'s true
2017-08-04T15:57:34 <colinclark> but what would it look like if it were firstly created for a collaboration?
2017-08-04T15:57:52 <colinclark> amongst "professionals" and those who actually live in these digital spaces we\'re designing
2017-08-04T15:58:00 <grrrero> Perspectives from that would be interesting and eye-opening I believe
2017-08-04T15:58:12 <colinclark> yup
2017-08-04T15:58:15 <grrrero> those who actually live in these digital spaces we\'re designing --> definitely
2017-08-04T15:58:35 <colinclark> I mean, I don\'t mean this at all as a criticism of Another Lens in itself
2017-08-04T15:59:15 <colinclark> I\'m just kind of dreaming of what it might be like if it were more than one lens
2017-08-04T15:59:27 <colinclark> I think my favourite question in the list is "Do I need to slow down?"
2017-08-04T15:59:52 <colinclark> This to me is a very, very profound point in our current technological culture
2017-08-04T16:00:09 <colinclark> startup culture, Facebook\'s "move fast and break things" etc.
2017-08-04T16:00:14 <colinclark> "Design moves fast, and we have to hustle to keep up. But research shows that often when we move fast we rely more heavily on biases."
2017-08-04T16:00:23 <grrrero> I like that
2017-08-04T16:00:34 <grrrero> Poignant for these times indeed
2017-08-04T16:00:39 <colinclark> I\'ve often dreamed of a "slow software" movement, like the slow food movement
2017-08-04T16:00:52 <grrrero> Yes!!
2017-08-04T16:01:00 <colinclark> but it\'s so easy for people to misinterpret that :)
2017-08-04T16:01:12 <grrrero> Of course :)
2017-08-04T16:01:14 <colinclark> engineering culture :P
2017-08-04T16:01:36 <grrrero> 2 fast 2 furious
2017-08-04T16:01:39 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-08-04T16:01:44 <colinclark> anyway, these questions are pretty fascinating
2017-08-04T16:02:32 <alanharnum> colinclark grrrero: https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/167297606698008576
2017-08-04T16:03:11 <colinclark> wow, great last word from alanharnum :)

2017-08-04T16:04:28 <colinclark> I guess the one question Airbnb\'s designers aren\'t asking themselves through any lens is "are my designs eroding social values and increasing the precarity of labour?"
2017-08-04T16:04:29 <colinclark> ;)
2017-08-04T16:04:45 <grrrero> Nice one colinclark
2017-08-04T16:05:00 <colinclark> a bit cheap :)
2017-08-04T16:05:21 <grrrero> Works for me hahaha
2017-08-04T16:05:21 <colinclark> but Caren can show us a nice infographic about those issues
2017-08-04T16:05:27 <grrrero> That would be awesome
2017-08-04T16:06:07 <colinclark> oh, here it is
2017-08-04T16:06:10 <colinclark> it has been posted!

2017-08-04T16:07:19 <grrrero> Nice!
2017-08-04T16:07:25 <colinclark> "Consider the opposite" is an interesting concept, too
2017-08-04T16:07:42 <colinclark> taken naively, it plays into binaristic thinking
2017-08-04T16:07:57 <colinclark> which of course we can see in lots of political situations these days via polarization
2017-08-04T16:08:29 <colinclark> maybe we need some Design Hegelianism :)
