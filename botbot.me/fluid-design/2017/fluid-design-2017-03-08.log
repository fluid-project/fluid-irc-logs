b'2017-03-08T21:06:09 <gtirloni> IT Services suggested adding "ocadu.ca" to the safe senders list ... but I guess that\'s insane.. adding your own domain to the safe list :)

2017-03-08T17:12:20 <colinclark> Jess_: It was a little rocky at times, but I think in the end Vivian was able to solicit some useful feedback from the project team.
2017-03-08T17:13:15 <Jess_> colinclark: rock re: the 102.2 work? the economic model work?
2017-03-08T17:13:26 <Jess_> *rocky
2017-03-08T17:13:33 <colinclark> No, I think it was more Vivian\'s background
2017-03-08T17:13:55 <Jess_> her background?
2017-03-08T17:14:00 <colinclark> she didn\'t know what a screenreader was, and made some awkward comments about how people with disabilities use the web
2017-03-08T17:14:08 <Jess_> ah, i see
2017-03-08T17:14:12 <colinclark> I think she learned a lot :)
2017-03-08T17:14:21 <Jess_> oh good
2017-03-08T17:14:23 <colinclark> She got an on-the-spot demonstration of Lukas\' braille display
2017-03-08T17:14:43 <Jess_> was there a conversation about the economic modeling?
2017-03-08T17:15:00 <colinclark> Not substantially, no
2017-03-08T17:15:06 <colinclark> she had a series of tables and walked us through them
2017-03-08T17:15:14 <colinclark> but there wasn\'t a lot related to economic modelling
2017-03-08T17:16:39 <Jess_> colinclark: i saw an email from gregg with what look like some personas in it
2017-03-08T17:16:45 <colinclark> Yes
2017-03-08T17:16:57 <colinclark> I think those need to be aligned with the ones from SP1
2017-03-08T17:16:59 <colinclark> I had suggested this previously
2017-03-08T17:17:09 <colinclark> a few weeks ago in the comments of a Google Doc with preparatory material for the review
2017-03-08T17:17:29 <Jess_> yes \xe2\x80\x94 well, gregg and others have been involved in the SP1 personas that are in the latest 103.1
2017-03-08T17:17:31 <colinclark> but perhaps someone from the SP1 team can take a look at Sepideh\'s amazing collection of personas and see if they map well with Gregg\'s user stories
2017-03-08T17:17:37 <colinclark> yes indeed
2017-03-08T17:18:06 <Jess_> ok, makes sense
2017-03-08T17:18:18 <Jess_> our next step is to get all of that into the wiki
2017-03-08T17:18:26 <Jess_> so that will be a good time to map them
2017-03-08T17:19:37 <colinclark> yes, it really will
2017-03-08T17:19:41 <colinclark> my sense was that there was still a gap between Vivian\'s view of SP1 and the rest of the project
2017-03-08T17:19:47 <colinclark> People seem aware now of SP1 generally
2017-03-08T17:19:56 <colinclark> they know about the personas and other models
2017-03-08T17:20:06 <colinclark> they even are talking about how to use those to present SP3\'s impact
2017-03-08T17:20:18 <colinclark> but there was perhaps a lack of awareness of the Developer Space and what it did/was for
2017-03-08T17:20:25 <colinclark> so that was probably the most productive outcome
2017-03-08T17:20:43 <colinclark> there was some informal mapping of the Developer Space to some of the platform models, via question-and-answer
2017-03-08T17:20:51 <Jess_> oh good
2017-03-08T17:22:01 <Jess_> the clarification of the DSpace is soemthign we\xe2\x80\x99ve also done recently with gregg, gianna, and others \xe2\x80\x94 the reworking of 404.2-2 \xe2\x80\x94 gregg wrote a draft re-clarifying the dspace and its relationship to the various components
2017-03-08T17:22:12 <Jess_> it seems a project-wide opportunity for clarification
2017-03-08T17:24:25 <colinclark> well
2017-03-08T17:24:29 <colinclark> i guess so
2017-03-08T17:25:03 <colinclark> it was pretty much a conversation between Vivian and Gregg/Till, so it might have  been a reinforcement of your meetings

2017-03-08T19:07:02 <danayo> gtirloni - owncloud seems to be spinning its wheels - tried creating a new folder and it seems to be stuck
2017-03-08T19:08:19 <gtirloni> danayo: hmm i can\'t reproduce. just created a folder and uploaded a file. i\'d try closing owncloud and opening it again just in case
2017-03-08T19:09:21 <danayo> thanks gtirloni - funny, it seems to have just sorted itself. muct be your magic touch!
2017-03-08T19:10:11 <gtirloni> i usually prefer things continue to be broken so i can investigate, but i think i\'ll settle for \'magically fixed itself\' :)

2017-03-08T19:22:08 <Justin_o> danayo:  and you\'d like to run those by at a design crit before implementation?
2017-03-08T19:22:59 <Justin_o> danayo: also regarding the toggles... is it okay if the on/off parts are clickable too, or you are expecting that only the toggle part is
2017-03-08T19:26:36 <danayo> Justin_o: there are a few options there, so we\'ll need to decide somehow, so I think a crit is probably best - what do you think?
2017-03-08T19:27:26 <danayo> Justin_o: I think the on/off should be clickable too
2017-03-08T19:27:46 <Justin_o> danayo: makes sense, if i have time i could try to mock up an implementation of the various options too.. if you think that would be helpful
2017-03-08T19:27:56 <Justin_o> okay, that should make implementation easier i think
2017-03-08T19:29:43 <danayo> sure Justin_o - if you have time - I created those pdfs to try to show a kind of on/off animation too (if you switch back and forth betwen the 2 pages)

2017-03-08T21:05:36 <jhung> Aside from it being ugly, is there any harm in those warnings gtirloni?
2017-03-08T21:05:44 <gtirloni> no, i don\'t think so
