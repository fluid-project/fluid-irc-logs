2017-02-17T15:38:57 <danayo> hi alanharnum, sorry for my late email reply - hope we can still meet with jutta at 12:30 - colinclark, michelled hope that works for you too
2017-02-17T15:39:14 <michelled> works for me!
2017-02-17T15:39:21 <michelled> oh, I forgot to reply \xe2\x80\xa6
2017-02-17T15:39:25 <alanharnum> danayo: no worries - it was pretty last minute, but Jutta is gone for all the next two weeks basically
2017-02-17T15:39:33 <alanharnum> so i felt it was important to seize the moment :)
2017-02-17T15:39:39 <danayo> for sure alanharnum!
2017-02-17T15:40:00 <danayo> thanks
2017-02-17T15:42:17 <colinclark> i\'ll be there, yes danayo
2017-02-17T15:42:30 <colinclark> hard to leave the chaos of this place, though!
2017-02-17T15:42:43 <danayo> great colinclark
2017-02-17T15:43:15 <danayo> colinclark can you also make the prototyping meeting if we move it to 1:30?
2017-02-17T15:43:31 <colinclark> yup
2017-02-17T15:43:54 <danayo> EXCELLENT
2017-02-17T15:44:15 <danayo> kitten chaos, colinclark?
2017-02-17T15:44:39 <danayo> oh, I like that alliteration!
2017-02-17T15:44:54 <colinclark> yep, kitten chaos
2017-02-17T15:45:03 <colinclark> we had a Cactus Incident this morning
2017-02-17T15:45:16 <danayo> cactus kitten chaos colinclark!!
2017-02-17T15:45:21 <colinclark> luckily the kitten didn\'t manage to impale him self and I think the cactus will be ok
2017-02-17T15:45:26 <danayo> omg
2017-02-17T15:45:30 <colinclark> yeah
2017-02-17T15:45:44 <colinclark> he\'s already opening doors, too
2017-02-17T15:45:51 <danayo> hilarious
2017-02-17T15:46:19 <colinclark> I\'m not sure Hugo thinks so
2017-02-17T15:46:27 <danayo> no. i\'m sure not
2017-02-17T15:46:37 <danayo> we had a kitten stay with us once
2017-02-17T15:46:47 <colinclark> why didn\'t you warn me, danayo? :)
2017-02-17T15:46:53 <danayo> :)
2017-02-17T15:46:59 <danayo> the kitten would jump on theo\'s back
2017-02-17T15:47:06 <colinclark> ha
2017-02-17T15:47:09 <colinclark> that couldn\'t have gone well
2017-02-17T15:47:20 <danayo> theo is such a low-key dude, but he had his limits
2017-02-17T15:47:27 <danayo> a well-timed swat!
2017-02-17T15:47:46 <colinclark> good theo!

2017-02-17T17:26:06 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: would you find a community meeting on Task Analysis helpful?
2017-02-17T17:27:19 <clown> Justin_o:  sure, if only to find out what "Task Analysis" is.
2017-02-17T17:27:46 <Justin_o> clown: "Task analysis is breaking a task down into all of the steps (physical and cognitive)."
2017-02-17T17:34:05 <gtirloni__> Justin_o: yes!

2017-02-17T17:49:39 <jhung> Justin_o: I was going to reply to Jon Udell re: our design crit notes. I added a section about the two use cases (read-only and edit modes)\xe2\x80\xa6 I was wondering if there was anything else we should add? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Accessible+Annotation+Creation+Tool+Notes
2017-02-17T17:50:03 <jhung> I\'ll trade you that for https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/811/files :)
2017-02-17T17:51:29 <Justin_o> jhung: sure, i just skimmed over it
2017-02-17T17:52:02 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-02-17T17:52:10 <Justin_o> jhung: i think that pretty much covered what we talked about, but I think the screen reader section should be generalized to both cases... as i guess there are questions for each... also we may want to explore keyboard only as well
2017-02-17T17:52:44 <Justin_o> that is, even if the screen reader can pass back the info from its virtual buffer, we\'d still want to handle the case where a user doesn\'t have a screen reader but wants to select with the keyboard
2017-02-17T17:58:12 <jhung> true. Can you add that Justin_o?
2017-02-17T17:58:19 <Justin_o> jhung: sure
2017-02-17T17:58:24 <jhung> ty
2017-02-17T18:02:20 <Justin_o> jhung: updated, https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Accessible+Annotation+Creation+Tool+Notes
