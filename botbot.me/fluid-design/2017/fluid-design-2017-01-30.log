2017-01-30T15:25:22 <jhung> Hi Caren. For tomorrow\'s design crit we were going to talk about Privacy. dayotte mentioned that you might have something to share?
2017-01-30T15:27:39 <Caren> Hi jhung. ah, yes, possibly. It\'s a first iteration storyboard for a plain language intro to digital privacy.
2017-01-30T15:29:01 <jhung> great Caren. Is it okay if I mention that in my weekly mailing for the design crit?
2017-01-30T15:30:13 <Caren> yes, sure, jhung

2017-01-30T16:49:00 <lliskovoi> hey colinclark sorry I missed your message on Friday
2017-01-30T16:49:32 <colinclark> no worries, lliskovoi
2017-01-30T16:49:46 <colinclark> were you able to sort out your Android situation?
2017-01-30T16:49:48 <lliskovoi> we worked out a plan for now using the Nexus tablet we have and Vera\'s phone for verification :)
2017-01-30T16:49:54 <colinclark> aha
2017-01-30T16:49:55 <colinclark> ok
2017-01-30T16:50:05 <colinclark> we should really just buy an unlocked PIxel for testing
2017-01-30T16:50:14 <colinclark> but that sounds like a great interim solution
2017-01-30T16:51:27 <lliskovoi> yeah, that would be fantastic, the worry is that mobile devices become out of date so fast, we\'re gonna see if we can work out some kind of loan program with one of the mobile providers we work with
