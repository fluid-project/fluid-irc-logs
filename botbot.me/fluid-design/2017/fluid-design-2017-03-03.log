2017-03-03T14:16:34 <Justin_o> jhung: what do you think of this and do you think there are better ways https://jsfiddle.net/vxakfoog/1/
2017-03-03T14:16:53 <Justin_o> trying to have a "unit" in an input field and keep them relatively centred
2017-03-03T14:17:10 <jhung> ah ok.
2017-03-03T14:21:38 <jhung> Justin_o: question - why isn\'t this done using a standard text field with a unit following the text field?
2017-03-03T14:25:42 <Justin_o> jhung: trying to match the designs https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+%28Learner%29+Options+Mobile+and+Responsive+Design?preview=/66551842/128483341/Learner%20Options%20High%20Contrast%20Adjusters-11.jpg
2017-03-03T14:25:54 <Justin_o> also note that the stepper buttons will be on either side
2017-03-03T14:26:44 <Justin_o> jhung: also, the second implementation in the fiddle is technically what you asked about. a standard textfield with a unit following
2017-03-03T14:26:51 <Justin_o> but styled to centre
2017-03-03T14:27:00 <Justin_o> but requires javascript ;(

2017-03-03T14:29:38 <jhung> Justin_o: Hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 the 2nd solution using JS to centre the text creates a maintenance issue. We\'d have to tweak and adjust as browser rendering changes over time.
2017-03-03T14:30:54 <Justin_o> jhung: what do you mean about browser rendering
2017-03-03T14:31:51 <jhung> well, it\'s the same issue we\'ve had with the button toggles in the previous UIO. The little dot was positioned "just so" but it was fragile. Not all browsers rendered it the same and it shifted slightly over time.
2017-03-03T14:32:18 <jhung> Justin_o: give me a minute and maybe we can Vidyo?
2017-03-03T14:32:58 <Justin_o> jhung: the x doesn\'t use relative or absolute positioning.. it\'s centred via a flex layout, so should be more resilient
2017-03-03T14:33:30 <Justin_o> and sure lets chat on vidyo in a bit
2017-03-03T14:35:29 <jhung> Justin_o: I think I have an alternative idea using a standard text field and no JS.

2017-03-03T16:07:42 <clown> hey danayo:  I\'ve got a copy of Anne Cavoukian\'s power point from her presentation last Tue.  Do you know how to upload content like that to the fluid wiki?  If not, I\'ll dig around the documentation.
2017-03-03T16:09:54 <danayo> alanharnum: this is crazy but could you please forward back to me those 2 email threads from the SJRK repair kit partners meeting follow-up? they seem to have vanished from my inbox
2017-03-03T16:11:22 <alanharnum> danayo: done

2017-03-03T16:21:56 <clown> danayo, sorry, I\'ve gone and read the docs, and done the upload.  I should have told you.  My bad.

2017-03-03T17:57:14 <jhung> sure lliskovoi
2017-03-03T18:04:37 <lliskovoi> jhung: this article on xml sitemaps and SEO might be useful: https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2048706/the-site-map-gateway-optimization

2017-03-03T19:52:33 <michelled> jhung: I don\'t know much about how the ILDH is built
2017-03-03T19:52:55 <michelled> alan has a pull request and I\'m happy with the content: https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/pull/11/files
2017-03-03T19:53:10 <jhung> michelled: ok.
2017-03-03T19:53:12 <michelled> he\'s added a new handlebars page
2017-03-03T19:53:21 <michelled> can I just push his pull request?
2017-03-03T19:53:25 <michelled> or do I need to do something else?
2017-03-03T19:54:37 <jhung> Yes. Once you merge, there\'s an automated process which deploys the changes to the site michelled. But before you do that, you\'d want to make sure that the new item is navigable from the menu etc (i.e. make sure that the site-structure.json file has been updated).
2017-03-03T19:55:07 <michelled> it looks like it has been
2017-03-03T19:55:27 <michelled> but I suppose you mean I should stage it myself locally
2017-03-03T19:56:03 <michelled> ah, looks like there are directions in the readme :)
2017-03-03T19:56:41 <jhung> michelled: yeah. Check it locally first. And if it looks good then merging + pushing should take care of the rest.
2017-03-03T19:58:57 <michelled> thx jhung - those directions are perfect :)
2017-03-03T19:59:09 * danayo has quit
2017-03-03T20:00:36 <michelled> jhung: do you know if it\'s a process that will happen immediately or at a specific time?
2017-03-03T20:09:34 <jhung> michelled: it should be immediate.
2017-03-03T20:10:10 <jhung> michelled: you might have to clear your cache for the changes to appear.
2017-03-03T20:18:30 <michelled> jhung: I\'m not seeing the updates
2017-03-03T20:20:35 <michelled> any thoughts on what I could try? Or shall I send it off to alan and gio to figure out?
2017-03-03T20:24:07 <jhung> let me see michelled...

2017-03-03T20:25:53 <jhung> Hmmm I don\'t see it either michelled. This would be a gtirloni question.
2017-03-03T20:26:10 <michelled> ok, I suspect he\'s waiting for a plane :)
2017-03-03T20:28:00 <jhung> michelled: ok. I guess it can wait until next week.
