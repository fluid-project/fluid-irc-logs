2017-12-04T16:44:43 <alanharnum> colinclark: so for any GPII demo, you\'re thinking run the current "library build" on the Surface (I believe we may do this already) and have Justin_o\'s UIO+ plug-in in Chrome?
2017-12-04T16:44:53 <colinclark> hmm
2017-12-04T16:44:58 <colinclark> not the library build any more, I think
2017-12-04T16:44:59 <jhung> colinclark: let me know when you have time to chat. Might be easier to chat on Vidyo.
2017-12-04T16:45:14 <colinclark> Justin_o or simonjb can probably suggest which build to use
2017-12-04T16:45:21 <colinclark> with the UIO+ plugin
2017-12-04T16:45:30 <alanharnum> Justin_o: OK - will see about this tomorrow when I\'m in the office
2017-12-04T16:45:44 <alanharnum> i agree it would be a good thing to demo
2017-12-04T16:46:07 <alanharnum> as it shows off another part of our recent work on adaptability
2017-12-04T16:46:14 <colinclark> yup
2017-12-04T16:46:45 <Justin_o> alanharnum: the parts needed for connecting UIO+ to GPII are in Universal master already..
2017-12-04T16:46:48 <colinclark> jhung: Can we do 1230 pm?
2017-12-04T16:47:02 <Justin_o> alanharnum: but i should be in the office tomorrow for us to chat about it
2017-12-04T16:47:11 <jhung> Sounds good colinclark. Ping me in the channel when you\'re free.
2017-12-04T16:47:16 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah, easier F2F - we\'ll talk tomorrow

2017-12-04T17:47:46 <colinclark> should we squeeze it in or try for later in the day?
2017-12-04T17:48:19 <jhung> colinclark: we can do later if you need to grab a lunch.

2017-12-04T18:18:09 <colinclark> danayo: It looks like I probably won\'t be free tomorrow until after 4 pm
2017-12-04T18:18:26 <jhung> colinclark: give me a sec, I think Canada Post just dropped off green coffee beans on the doorstep. :)
2017-12-04T18:18:31 <colinclark> ok no problem!
2017-12-04T18:18:36 <colinclark> i didn\'t know you roasted!

2017-12-04T18:27:00 <gmoss> danayo: I\'m available any time after 2pm tomorrow!
2017-12-04T18:27:56 <danayo> ok colinclark, perhaps we can try to meet at 4 then ?
2017-12-04T18:28:18 <colinclark> danayo: It might be best if you all just go ahead without me
2017-12-04T18:28:33 <colinclark> I don\'t want to be a bottleneck\xe2\x80\x94my availability is going to be a bit less over the next week or two
2017-12-04T18:28:39 <colinclark> but I\'m happy to answer questions if needed

2017-12-04T20:27:40 <danayo> BC Hydro cut down a special tree that was dear to the community, and as it turns out was also host to a rare lichen
2017-12-04T21:31:43 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-12-04T21:38:00 <colinclark> danayo: Do you know how he will save the lichen?
2017-12-04T21:38:18 <colinclark> Bosmon is a huge fan of lichen, so I\'m sure he\'ll be very excited :)
2017-12-04T21:38:46 <danayo> he is looking for similar host trees, in the same area, to transplant it
2017-12-04T21:38:56 <danayo> big-leaf maples with lots of moss cover
2017-12-04T21:39:07 <colinclark> oh wow
2017-12-04T21:39:21 <danayo> CBC just got wind of the story
2017-12-04T21:39:31 <danayo> breaking news!
2017-12-04T21:39:34 <colinclark> that\'s good!
2017-12-04T21:40:58 <danayo> yes
2017-12-04T21:43:36 <danayo> folks here are not impressed with Hydro\'s executive decision making
