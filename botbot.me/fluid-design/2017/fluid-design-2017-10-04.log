2017-10-04T13:58:06 <Jess_> Caren_: it looks great \xe2\x80\x94 already sent you two email replies

2017-10-04T15:49:16 <jhung> dana, we can chat on Vidyo about ice breakers?
2017-10-04T15:49:25 <danayo> sure!
2017-10-04T15:49:35 <jhung> danayo: now okay?
2017-10-04T15:49:46 <danayo> yes, fluid standup?
2017-10-04T15:49:50 <jhung> sure
2017-10-04T15:49:54 * michelled joined the channel
2017-10-04T15:50:35 <Caren_> danayo: icebreaker idea I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in action was paper (could have scissors, tape, markers) and paper clips, create something (anything that you want), make sure the paper clip is attached somewhere on the outside of your creation so it can be joined to someone elses creation. A full mobile of all participants was created and enjoyed during the event.
2017-10-04T15:51:12 <Caren_> it was facilitated by Vanessa from the Delta cohort

2017-10-04T16:09:29 <danayo> thanks Caren_ that sounds like a really good one
2017-10-04T16:10:10 <danayo> jhung and I were just brainstorming some other ideas - I\'ll document them on the wiki at some point
2017-10-04T16:13:31 <danayo> Caren_: we were thinking about having each group build abstract "tools" or art out of lego or other toys - then rotating the groups and having a 2nd group provide a function or a title for the tool or art, then a 3rd group perhaps modifying the original, then finally the 1st group again has to promote the tool or critique/present the artwork based on the descriptions
2017-10-04T16:16:29 <danayo> alanharnum, colinclark: sepidehshahi and I thought it might be good to try and have another BiT checkin meeting before the co-design session - I was going to see if I could organise one for monday the 16th - does that sound good to you?
2017-10-04T16:16:53 <colinclark> definitely
2017-10-04T16:16:56 <Caren_> danayo: that sounds like a wonderful mini co-design
2017-10-04T16:17:09 <colinclark> it\'s coming up so soon, danayo!
2017-10-04T16:17:18 <danayo> indeed colinclark!
2017-10-04T16:17:49 <danayo> maybe we need to meet sooner than that colinclark? it\'s just that next week is so packed
2017-10-04T16:18:02 <danayo> i think we can sort out the invite stuff by email
2017-10-04T16:18:36 <colinclark> I\'m fine with either
2017-10-04T16:18:40 <colinclark> next week is definitely packed
2017-10-04T16:18:44 <colinclark> but if you want, I can make time
2017-10-04T16:20:37 <danayo> ok colinclark,  it would have to be tuesday the 10th I guess. maybe I\'ll send out an email to everyone to see what they think
2017-10-04T16:20:44 <colinclark> ok cool
2017-10-04T16:20:47 <danayo> thanks
2017-10-04T16:21:15 <danayo> see above for hopefully cringe-free "icebreaker" ideas colinclark :)
2017-10-04T16:21:50 <colinclark> pretty interesting, actually :)
2017-10-04T16:24:58 <sepidehshahi> danayo: both the 10th and the 16th work for me
2017-10-04T16:25:40 <danayo> great sepidehshahi, thanks
2017-10-04T16:26:46 <sepidehshahi> danayo: the ice-breaker activity sounds really cool
2017-10-04T16:28:21 <danayo> great sepidehshahi, colinclark - hopefully fun + effective + low pressure
2017-10-04T16:28:33 <danayo> + inclusive!
2017-10-04T16:28:47 <colinclark> and that, yes :)
2017-10-04T16:30:43 <sepidehshahi> danayo: just in terms of being inclusive, do you know if all participants can participate in the building process?
2017-10-04T16:33:09 <michelled> danayo: you were able to participate remotely in the create a thon, right?
2017-10-04T16:33:16 <michelled> since we might have remote folks?
2017-10-04T16:33:52 <danayo> I was michelled
2017-10-04T16:34:04 <michelled> I also love that idea, btw - it reminds me the collaborative paintings I was part of in Bonnie Devine\'s craft circle
2017-10-04T16:34:25 <danayo> I don\'t know sepidehshahi, but I\'m thinking we can also assist each other in the building process
2017-10-04T16:34:37 <danayo> cool michelled
2017-10-04T16:34:47 <danayo> that sounds fun
2017-10-04T16:35:50 <danayo> when I was participating remotely in the create-a-thon, I had to tell the others in my group what I wanted to build, and they would do it for me
2017-10-04T16:36:02 <danayo> sepidehshahi, michelled ^

2017-10-04T17:23:25 <jhung> fluid-everyone: you might be interested in this game that Google made to teach kids (and adults) about internet safety and privacy. https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/
2017-10-04T17:23:46 <danayo> oh interesting jhung
2017-10-04T17:24:07 <jhung> The abstractions they created to represent "cyber bullies" etc is rather interesting.
2017-10-04T17:24:20 <grrrero> jhung I like the When in doubt, Talk it out
2017-10-04T17:25:07 * danayo has quit
2017-10-04T17:26:40 <jhung> Yeah grrrero! So much of what happens on the Internet isn\'t shared with parents. It\'s good to start the dialog early.
2017-10-04T17:27:42 <grrrero> It\'s super interesting because the Internet has become a playground for trolling and cyberbullying (especially anonymously) so initiating discussion and learning how to talk things over without being abusive is important
2017-10-04T17:28:18 <grrrero> We can agree to disagree, etc., and leave it at that
2017-10-04T17:29:30 <jhung> Not sure if I agree with that grrrero, but I agree to disagree. :D /jk
2017-10-04T17:29:42 <grrrero> Hahahaha jhung
