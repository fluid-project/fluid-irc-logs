2017-07-24T17:51:58 <jhung> For tomorrow\'s design crit, do you have any links to share? Can you describe it to me in a sentence so I can include it in the weekly email lliskovoi?
2017-07-24T17:53:38 <lliskovoi> jhung: We will be creating personas to illustrate the benefits of meeting common WCAG guideline failures, as well as curb cuts created by meeting those guidelines
2017-07-24T17:55:01 <lliskovoi> and no links to share at the moment, although there may be links that I will share during the activity
2017-07-24T17:55:57 <jhung> ok lliskovoi. Sounds good. Thanks!
2017-07-24T17:56:06 <lliskovoi> *addressing, not meeting WCAG guideline failures, I now realize that statement doesn\'t really make sense haha
2017-07-24T17:56:22 <jhung> lol
2017-07-24T17:56:52 <jhung> Sounds like a terrible company slogan "We aim to meet failures" . :D
