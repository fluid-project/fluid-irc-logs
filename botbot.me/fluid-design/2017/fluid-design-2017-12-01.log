b'2017-12-01T19:00:45 <gmoss> should we consider transcribing audio from a video?
2017-12-01T19:00:49 <alanharnum> i am (fingers crossed) hoping that the recent Mozilla announcement on voice recognition means that we\'ll see good-quality Web Speech API SpeechRecognition in Firefox soon.
2017-12-01T19:00:57 <gmoss> yes, alanharnum!
2017-12-01T19:00:59 <gmoss> me too
2017-12-01T19:01:40 <alanharnum> gmoss: I\'d imagine the eventual world is one where audio recording, video recording and transcription are all loosely coupled components
2017-12-01T19:01:50 <gmoss> (btw danayo_ this video about the Tsilhqot\'in youth is very captivating)
2017-12-01T19:01:51 <alanharnum> so that we can apply them apart or together as needed
2017-12-01T19:02:16 <gmoss> alanharnum: that makes sense
2017-12-01T19:02:45 <simonjb> colinclark: does it still work for you to meet now? we\'re in my vidyo room
2017-12-01T19:02:46 <gmoss> perhaps offering the user the option to automagically transcribe their audio, or just to record the audio only
2017-12-01T19:02:54 <colinclark> yes, it does simonjb
2017-12-01T19:02:54 <danayo_> how I got to this colinclark was as I was working on the UI design I added a button for dictation (i.e. to access the transcribing recorder) but then thought it might be redundant, as there is something similar on the mobile keyboard
2017-12-01T19:02:57 <colinclark> let me just find my headset
2017-12-01T19:03:12 <alanharnum> i.e. someone might want to use speech to save their story as text, but not want their voice recorded; someone might want to apply transcription later to an audio file. etc
2017-12-01T19:03:36 <gmoss> mhmm
2017-12-01T19:03:41 <colinclark> danayo_: I guess the key is that this isn\'t really dictation
2017-12-01T19:03:49 <colinclark> When you\'re dictating, you\'re writing
2017-12-01T19:03:51 <colinclark> :)
2017-12-01T19:03:54 <danayo_> yes colinclark
2017-12-01T19:04:00 <gmoss> but it could be! :]
2017-12-01T19:04:02 <danayo_> but I can see that it is not redundant given all the additional functionality we\'ll offer
2017-12-01T19:04:08 <colinclark> Here, you\'re telling a story in audio
2017-12-01T19:04:26 <colinclark> and we can automatically produce a different version of it
2017-12-01T19:04:30 <danayo_> YES
2017-12-01T19:04:47 <alanharnum> Mozilla\'s open source code raises a number of possibilities that I hadn\'t considered previously, like being able to run a back-end voice recognition service to support browsers that don\'t have good SpeechRecognition support, etc.
2017-12-01T19:04:56 <colinclark> right now, reflecting the sketchiness of the prototype, we do the transcription in real time
2017-12-01T19:05:09 <colinclark> but I think in practice it will be part of what I hope can be a very simple, mobile-optimized editing process
2017-12-01T19:05:29 <colinclark> where you can take audio clips, trim them, arrange them, and then have a look at the at synchronized text for it
2017-12-01T19:05:32 <colinclark> same goes for video
2017-12-01T19:06:12 <alanharnum> colinclark danayo_ gmoss: I\'m hoping we have some time to hack on that in Boston in our downtime, I want to experimentally wire into the Noun Project API to try and get that "voice transcription doodling" Caren_ raised as a possibility a little while back :)
2017-12-01T19:07:37 <danayo_> colinclark: that sounds excellent
2017-12-01T19:07:51 <danayo_> it\'s helpful to hear your vision for it colinclark, alanharnum, gmoss  - it wasn\'t totally clear to me
2017-12-01T19:07:59 <colinclark> not sure it\'s clear to me either
2017-12-01T19:08:02 <danayo_> :)
2017-12-01T19:08:08 <colinclark> but i guess there\'s an aspect of "authorship" that matters
2017-12-01T19:08:12 <colinclark> in terms of the original media
2017-12-01T19:08:52 <gmoss> haha well the more I think about this, danayo_, the more I consider new possibilities, which of course means new features and new designs and grander and grander scope for this site
2017-12-01T19:09:11 <gmoss> alanharnum: that would be amazing!
2017-12-01T19:09:21 <gmoss> I must have missed that idea, that\'s great
2017-12-01T19:09:50 <gmoss> "hedgehogs and cacti" could then become a set of the icons we drew on wednesday
2017-12-01T19:10:00 <gmoss> *those words spoken aloud
2017-12-01T19:10:58 <danayo_> alanharnum: hacking into the noun project sounds great
2017-12-01T19:11:57 <danayo_> +1 to authorship question/aspect colinclark

2017-12-01T19:31:50 <simonjb> cool
2017-12-01T19:31:57 <colinclark> Maman is one of a number of spiders she\'s done around the world
2017-12-01T19:32:13 <colinclark> both as outdoor sculptures and ones installed in galleries
2017-12-01T19:32:19 <simonjb> yes, I\'ve seen photos of some others
2017-12-01T19:32:25 <simonjb> they\'re great
2017-12-01T19:32:51 <colinclark> I took a lot of video of Maman when I was there in October
2017-12-01T19:32:58 <colinclark> she\'s very impressive
2017-12-01T19:34:11 <simonjb> she was installed at the National Gallery when I was loving there
2017-12-01T19:34:14 <simonjb> living
2017-12-01T19:34:15 <simonjb> ha
2017-12-01T19:34:32 <simonjb> living and loving also :)
2017-12-01T19:34:35 <gmoss> simonjb colinclark it\'s such an impressive sculpture, I managed to see it in Tokyo when I was there the first time. what a sight.
2017-12-01T19:36:03 <colinclark> interesting that there are multiple versions of her around the world!
2017-12-01T19:36:15 <gmoss> indeed
2017-12-01T19:37:45 <gmoss> Many Mamans
2017-12-01T19:37:59 <colinclark> :)
2017-12-01T19:49:09 <colinclark> danayo: I guess the other thing that\'s notable about what we\'re thinking of for the audio transcription is that it\'s synchronized
2017-12-01T19:50:01 <colinclark> where ordinary dictation uses audio as a means to an end (text), we have these two things side-by-side (metaphorically speaking, anyway)

2017-12-01T21:25:07 <danayo> thanks colinclark, saw your ping about synchronized audio/text
2017-12-01T21:29:07 <danayo> colinclark: in the designs right now I\'ve got it broken down into Text/Images/Audio/Video ... just as starting points really - but it\'s tricky to organise because there will be so much multi-modal crossover, especially with something like the trascribing recorder. but maybe it creates a category of its own somehow
2017-12-01T21:45:11 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-12-01T21:51:07 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-12-01T21:54:25 <gmoss> danayo: maybe the transcribing recorder part can be under "audio" in the new design, but then it also expands the text frame, so they\'re both \'open\'
2017-12-01T21:54:53 <gmoss> or maybe the transcription should be stored separately from the text story content...
2017-12-01T21:58:16 <colinclark> danayo: I\'ll be keen to see your latest designs
2017-12-01T21:58:53 <colinclark> It\'ll probably be a lot more work, but I wonder if we shouldn\'t think through what a next version might look like if it\'s not modal, but "compositional"
2017-12-01T21:59:05 <colinclark> in the sense that you can easily just start typing, or just hit record
2017-12-01T21:59:14 <colinclark> and then move things around in relation to each other as you do so
2017-12-01T22:00:02 <colinclark> like maybe you want to record a little bite-sized video and then put a written caption beside it
2017-12-01T22:01:36 <danayo> colinclark: for sure - that\'s kind of the approach I was taking, but with a first step requiring collapsing/expanding a text section, or video section etc ... but I like the idea of a more compositional approach
2017-12-01T22:02:59 <colinclark> cool
2017-12-01T22:03:03 <colinclark> one step at a time, too
2017-12-01T22:03:32 <colinclark> I just keep thinking that I agree with alanharnum from a technical perspective but not at all from a design perspective
2017-12-01T22:03:37 <colinclark> in regards to "loosely coupled components"
2017-12-01T22:04:15 <colinclark> I think this\'ll be most interesting when all the different modes are really integrated
2017-12-01T22:05:09 <danayo> yes, it will be awesome :)

2017-12-01T14:50:05 <grrrero> And e.g. Upcoming Workshop -- is there an existing Upcoming Workshop blog page to link to?
2017-12-01T14:51:02 <jhung> grrrero: Yes. The intention is for those front 3 panels is to give a summary / tease and to link to somewhere else.

2017-12-01T15:25:10 <sepidehshahi> sure simonjb
2017-12-01T15:25:21 <simonjb> when is good for you?
2017-12-01T15:26:00 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings today, so I\xe2\x80\x99m available all day simonjb
2017-12-01T15:26:43 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: how about in 30 mins? at 11?
2017-12-01T15:26:55 <sepidehshahi> sure

2017-12-01T15:36:18 <simonjb> would you be interested and have time to join us?
2017-12-01T15:36:46 <simonjb> we scheduled 11 but we can change to another time that would be better for you

2017-12-01T15:59:22 <simonjb> here's what I'm thinking: maybe sepidehshahi and I go ahead and chat at 11 and if you are available this afternoon, colinclark, we could chat the 3 of us then? at say 2pm?
2017-12-01T15:59:33 <colinclark> sounds great
2017-12-01T15:59:37 <colinclark> good plan

2017-12-01T18:30:07 <sepidehshahi> absolutely danayo_ here is the link to the file, but there are more iterations in the Visible Nexus folder under the projects.
2017-12-01T18:30:45 <danayo_> strange, that folder isn't showing up Owncloud for me sepidehshahi

2017-12-01T18:31:22 <sepidehshahi> or really? and I can\xe2\x80\x99t generate a link. let me see if there is a problem
2017-12-01T18:32:31 <danayo_> hmm sepidehshahi: it shows up in my browser but not in my synced files ... not sure why
2017-12-01T18:33:39 <sepidehshahi> it shows me that it is synced, it is strange. so do you have access to the files?
2017-12-01T18:34:05 <danayo_> I didn't get your link sepidehshahi, but in the folder I see 6 versions

2017-12-01T18:39:35 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-12-01T18:41:02 <danayo_> this looks very cool sepidehshahi, and complex :)
2017-12-01T18:41:19 <simonjb> beautiful video danayo
2017-12-01T18:42:18 <danayo_> +1 simonjb
2017-12-01T18:42:56 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo_ we tried different approaches but it still looks complex. please let me know if you had thoughts or comments how to simplify or improve it
2017-12-01T18:43:21 <sepidehshahi> and +1 for the video
2017-12-01T18:43:23 <danayo_> sepidehshahi, I think I'd need to be walked through it sepidehshahi - would love to discuss at a crit if possible ?
2017-12-01T18:43:44 <danayo_> it looks great
2017-12-01T18:43:49 <danayo_> there's just a lot going on :)
2017-12-01T18:44:02 <sepidehshahi> for sure, Maybe simonjb and I can take it to a design crit
2017-12-01T18:44:09 <danayo_> that would be great
2017-12-01T18:44:21 <simonjb> good idea
2017-12-01T18:47:59 * mrtyler has quit
2017-12-01T18:54:10 <danayo_> colinclark, alanharnum, gmoss: I'm wondering...regarding the recording transcriber for the storytelling tool - this would be separate from any mobile-OS level dictation tool, right?
2017-12-01T18:54:16 <danayo_> I'm assuming we would add this as an embedded tool (and that it would probably have additional features to those available with basic dictation)? wondering if the user should have the option to use one or the other, or otherwise how they might work together (or not), if that makes sense?
2017-12-01T18:54:41 <gmoss> danayo_: yes I think it would be separate, as the dictation would be a device-level mechanism to turn voice into text
2017-12-01T18:55:07 <gmoss> what we've been talking about doing would be to capture the audio and text and keep both, rather than keep text only
2017-12-01T18:55:30 <alanharnum> danayo_: I'm not sure how something like Dragon Naturally Speaking works, but I'd imagine it does keyboard / mouse emulation based on voice recognition, so yeah, it would be separate
2017-12-01T18:55:30 <danayo_> right, that makes sense gmoss
2017-12-01T18:55:47 <gmoss> I wonder, though, if there's a way to make that happen using a device or web API of some kind rather than rolling our own
2017-12-01T18:56:18 <alanharnum> the transcribing recorder is using in-browser features for recording and voice recognition, rather than being a voice-based interface of the kind Dragon is
2017-12-01T18:57:10 <danayo_> alanharnum: what I meant by mobile-OS level dictation was just the option to dictate on the keyboard (when filing out any text field)
2017-12-01T18:57:36 <alanharnum> danayo_: ah; yes, same comment would apply
2017-12-01T18:57:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-12-01T18:57:52 <danayo_> ok right, so it's simliar to Dragon
2017-12-01T18:57:53 <danayo_> got it
2017-12-01T18:59:06 <danayo_> alanharnum, gmoss: so what you're saying is that there will be much more to it - incl voice recognition, and storing both audio and text
2017-12-01T18:59:08 <danayo_> ?
2017-12-01T18:59:40 <danayo_> by voice recognition I mean, something more than just recording text
2017-12-01T18:59:44 <colinclark> i'm slightly confused by this whole conversation :)
2017-12-01T18:59:46 <colinclark> it's interesting
2017-12-01T18:59:47 <colinclark> but confusing
2017-12-01T18:59:48 <danayo_> although I dont' know what that is
2017-12-01T18:59:55 <danayo_> haha colinclark  I think I confused myself
2017-12-01T18:59:59 <alanharnum> danayo_: yup, that's the eventual vision - a way for someone to record a story and get a transcription of it even without special software
2017-12-01T19:00:23 <gmoss> danayo_: yeah, i think it will be quite a multi-faceted input setup. recording and storing audio, using the transcribing recorder to capture any spoken text from that, but also offering the option to write text in the text fields, potentially in multiple languages, etc etc
2017-12-01T19:00:36 <gmoss> not to mention video :)
