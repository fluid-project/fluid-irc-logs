2017-05-16T15:53:49 <lliskovoi> colinclark caren so what\'s this diagram you speak of?
2017-05-16T15:53:59 <colinclark> hey lliskovoi and Caren
2017-05-16T15:54:36 <lliskovoi> hello hello colinclark
2017-05-16T15:55:34 <colinclark> Trebor Scholz, who Jutta and I are working on a proposal to the Kellogg Foundation with\xe2\x80\x94I mentioned it at standup yesterday\xe2\x80\x94has a sketch
2017-05-16T15:55:36 <colinclark> or a couple of sketches
2017-05-16T15:55:51 <colinclark> this is for the platform cooperative proposal\xe2\x80\x94it\'s going to be quite interesting
2017-05-16T15:56:24 <colinclark> and Jutta suggested that one or both of you could lend a hand preparing Trebor\'s rough sketch into an illustration suitable for the 3-pager we\'re sending later this week
2017-05-16T15:57:52 <lliskovoi> sounds interesting colinclark, can you provide context beyond the rough sketches?
2017-05-16T15:57:57 <colinclark> yes of course :)
2017-05-16T15:58:18 <colinclark> Do you both have a few minutes to chat on vidyo, Caren and lliskovoi?
2017-05-16T15:58:18 <lliskovoi> great! would you be available to chat around 2pm?
2017-05-16T15:59:11 <colinclark> sure, no problem
2017-05-16T16:00:06 <Caren> hey, colinclark and lliskovoi. I\xe2\x80\x99m available to chat.
2017-05-16T16:00:29 <lliskovoi> should we meet now or 2? what\'s better for you?
2017-05-16T16:01:04 <colinclark> sooner the better is good for me
2017-05-16T16:01:07 <colinclark> in the meantime, here\'s a paper by Trebor that talks about the idea of platform cooperatives: http://www.publicseminar.org/2015/04/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy/
2017-05-16T16:01:22 <colinclark> but I\'ll send along the draft 3-pager and sketches once we talk
2017-05-16T16:01:58 <lliskovoi> sounds good, should we all meet in your room then?
2017-05-16T16:01:58 <Caren> either is fine with me! I can do 2pm .
2017-05-16T16:04:19 <colinclark> yep, my room is fine
2017-05-16T16:04:27 <colinclark> but I\'m fuzzy on when works best for you both
2017-05-16T16:04:30 <colinclark> now or at 2 pm?
2017-05-16T16:05:24 <danayo> thanks for those links Caren
2017-05-16T16:05:45 <lliskovoi> colinclark caren, I can do either
2017-05-16T16:05:59 <colinclark> can you meet now, Caren?
2017-05-16T16:05:59 <Caren> Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it now, then?
2017-05-16T16:06:52 <colinclark> yes
2017-05-16T16:06:53 <colinclark> that\'d be great

2017-05-16T16:22:34 <colinclark> Caren, lliskovoi: The "less visual" diagram that Jutta forwarded you from Trebor, the one with the numbered "sections"\xe2\x80\x94here\'s what Trebor said about it: "The attached is not exactly visual but maybe your designer could assign a pictogram to each segment."
2017-05-16T16:23:08 <colinclark> and then you should have another diagram from Jutta "with Nurses added," which is his more visual sketch, but I believe he\'s interested in refining both diagrams
2017-05-16T16:23:43 <colinclark> For the second, more three dimensional diagram, he said: "in the background you can add a small group and say: platform coop for home health care."
