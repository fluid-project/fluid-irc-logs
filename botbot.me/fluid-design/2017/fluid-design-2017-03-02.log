2017-03-02T20:51:13 <Justin_o> didn\'t realize he was canadian
2017-03-02T20:56:22 <Justin_o> danayo: for the steppers, how important is it for the "X" unit and the input value to always be centred within the input field?
2017-03-02T21:05:50 <danayo> Justin_o: it looks better if they are centered together, but I\'d say it\'s ok if the X stays in place and the number is nearly centered
2017-03-02T21:06:12 <danayo> I\'m assuming that\'s the issue - that the X needs to stay put?
