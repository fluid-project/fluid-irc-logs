2017-03-22T14:36:21 <Justin_o> danayo: potential new font colour for UIO #5d5652
2017-03-22T15:02:12 <Caren> colinclark, danayo in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s crit you mentioned a paper that spoke to co-design\xe2\x80\xa6I believe you co-authoured. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind having a read, can you direct me to it?
2017-03-22T15:03:26 <colinclark> Caren: This is paper, written by me, danayo, and Bosmon: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-40250-5_17
2017-03-22T15:03:41 <colinclark> it's a funny sort of mashup of ideas
2017-03-22T15:04:13 <colinclark> and it doesn't go deeply into strategies for co-design, more just a tracing of how it relates to other forms of design in the context of open communities
2017-03-22T15:04:21 <colinclark> let me get you the pre-print PDF
