2017-09-05T15:55:51 <colinclark> danayo: I\'m pretty excited to read your notes from the last SJRK partners meeting
2017-09-05T15:56:00 <colinclark> and I\'m glad there\'s some conversation going now
2017-09-05T15:56:13 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-05T15:57:44 <colinclark> I like this one of James\' points a lot: "A wide range of ways of seeing,hearing and perceiving the world.There is no standard right way of telling a story.There are many ways of telling stories.Providing guidance through illustrations and demonstrations  is to facilitate people to tell their story in their own ways."

2017-09-05T17:31:03 <colinclark> awesome, thanks danayo_
2017-09-05T17:31:22 <danayo_> I agree, I also like James\' comments about storytelling - no one way to do it, no one story
2017-09-05T17:33:24 <danayo_> sepidehshahi: can we meet at 2pm ET?
2017-09-05T17:33:52 <sepidehshahi> for sure danayo_

2017-09-05T18:58:25 <danayo> hi gtirloni: can\'t seem to log into owncloud today - it\'s not recognizing my password...pretty sure I have it right, and when I try to reset it it\'s telling me to check my user name (which I think I also have right!)
2017-09-05T19:00:46 <danayo> sepidehshahi: meet again now? i\'m in my room
2017-09-05T19:00:55 <sepidehshahi> sure

2017-09-05T19:17:55 <gtirloni> danayo: does it work if you reset the password?
2017-09-05T19:22:31 <danayo> yeah that\'s the one I tried gtirloni
2017-09-05T19:23:01 <danayo> "couldn\'t send reset email. Please make sure your username is correct"
