2017-05-04T16:17:56 <Caren> danayo: hi we're just having lunch. Shall we skype you when we're done and starting the introduction.
2017-05-04T16:18:35 <danayo> that sounds perfect Caren. I'm in the Vidyo room - could use that until the breakout groups?
2017-05-04T16:18:56 <danayo> whatever works best
2017-05-04T16:19:36 <Caren> Yes! That makes sense
2017-05-04T16:20:34 <Caren> Jon's connecting VIDYO so come on in

2017-05-04T20:20:37 <Caren> also, if you have any feedback on the remote participation (what worked well, what was challenging\xe2\x80\xa6), I can add it to our learning notes.
