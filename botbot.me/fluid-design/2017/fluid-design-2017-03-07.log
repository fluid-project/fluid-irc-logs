2017-03-07T19:49:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: I think last week you were mentioning you were interested in having a feature in aria where you could specify priorities for alerts. and I believe you were planning on filing a ticket with aria to add that..
2017-03-07T19:50:13 <cindyli> right, Justin_o
2017-03-07T19:50:20 <Justin_o> at a code sprint last week, there was some work done on a priority queue for alerts, perhaps there will be some information or a use case you could use
2017-03-07T19:50:23 <Justin_o> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vcWdGC7Wcp4m20497GJVN_d0maXwptz0h8UStxjfwko/edit#heading=h.nff6wqv5kobo
2017-03-07T19:50:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: it\'s the notes from group 4 there
2017-03-07T19:50:57 <Justin_o> and there\'s some code in a repo to support it, but it\'s all done client side, not in a AT.
2017-03-07T19:51:17 <Justin_o> So there are limitations in knowing when an alert has actually been made
2017-03-07T19:52:26 <cindyli> i see, the code to create a queue
2017-03-07T19:53:15 <cindyli> why do you have trouble "knowing when an alert has actually been made"?
2017-03-07T19:54:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: because the AT doesn\'t actually tell you when it starts and stops synthesizing the alert..
2017-03-07T19:54:06 <cindyli> Justin_o: if you know when a live region state is set to assertive or alert in the code?
2017-03-07T19:54:25 <Justin_o> cindyli: that part you know, but you don\'t know when the actions is actually performed
2017-03-07T19:54:30 <cindyli> i see
2017-03-07T19:54:56 <cindyli> yes, it would be nice to have AT control the announcement of all alerts

2017-03-07T21:15:39 <Caren> But let me get you a link to the prototype
