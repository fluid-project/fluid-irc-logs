2017-10-03T20:35:07 <Justin_o> danayo: no problem.. i wrote up some notes on the JIRA. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6204
2017-10-03T20:35:36 <Justin_o> danayo: one question that came up was why did we move away from the sliders to the steppers.. i couldn't quite remember the reason
2017-10-03T20:37:19 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2017-10-03T20:37:37 * jessm has quit
2017-10-03T20:37:51 <danayo> sliders to steppers was due to feedback about improving accessibility

2017-10-03T16:19:23 <lliskovoi> Hi everyone! For those who are interested in tracking data for a month as an internal experiment, how about we start today (unless you are already tracking something) and collect information for 4 weeks, and then schedule a design crit for October 31st to discuss challenges/insights?
2017-10-03T16:20:40 <sepidehshahi> danayo: great notes! you captured everything I had in my notepad. Should we add this to the MyL3 Wiki page meeting notes?
