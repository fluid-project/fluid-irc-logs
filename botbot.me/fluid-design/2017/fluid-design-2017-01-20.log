2017-01-20T16:16:53 <danayo> Justin_o: I updated the attachment to the mobile UIO wireframes on the wiki page - a few changes including the label for "emphasize links & buttons" - let me know what you think
2017-01-20T16:18:09 <danayo> also, I\'m having trouble with the wiki editor - it keeps turning text into links (i.e. it styles it with a hover state/underline with nothing actually linked) - have you experienced this?

2017-01-20T18:23:35 <Jess_> David123_: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to coordinate with you on the SNOW article when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready
2017-01-20T18:24:27 <David123_> Jess_: Ok im ready
2017-01-20T18:24:45 <Jess_> David123_: how can we connect with audio also? Do you have vidyo installed? Skype? Google Talk?

2017-01-20T18:26:51 <David123_> Jess_: I think skype would work best since i will need an account for vidyo
2017-01-20T18:27:17 <Jess_> David123_: you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need an account, but if Skype works for you then let\xe2\x80\x99s do that. I am jesshmitchell on skype
2017-01-20T18:29:59 <Kobi> So are we doing Vidyo or Skype?

2017-01-20T18:31:02 <Kobi> OK

2017-01-20T18:38:41 <lliskovoi> danayo, alanharn: came across this project on the Design Matters podcast (interview with Giorgia Lupi): http://www.dear-data.com/theproject. It\'s a year of correspondence and friendship through personal data tracking and visualization.
2017-01-20T18:41:24 <danayo> very cool lliskovoi !
2017-01-20T18:42:33 <colinclark> these are such lovely documents, lliskovoi
2017-01-20T18:45:12 <lliskovoi> danayo, colinclark the visualizations are so beautiful! Perhaps we can use components of this story for our collaboration use case. I love that it\'s an exploratory project and that they set up min mutual goals together. I\'m going to try and get my hands on a copy of the book.
2017-01-20T18:46:03 <colinclark> I love mail art
