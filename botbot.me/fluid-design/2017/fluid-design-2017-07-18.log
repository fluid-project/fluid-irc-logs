2017-07-18T15:26:02 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: James shared this with me and thought others might be interested in it as well. https://usecontrast.com
2017-07-18T15:28:37 <jhung> Thanks Justin_o. I use https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/ It\'s not as fancy, but it\'s worked for my purposes so far.
2017-07-18T15:28:54 <jhung> (Mac and Windows, and free)
2017-07-18T15:31:42 <Justin_o> i\'ve been using this for quickly checking colour options, http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/
2017-07-18T15:32:13 <jhung> Ah. Lea Verou is great. I\'ve used a lot of her stuff and CSS tricks before Justin_o.

2017-07-18T15:47:13 <Justin_o> danayo: no problem, i think lliskovoi has some other options too
2017-07-18T15:47:27 <Justin_o> jhung, lliskovoi: if only we had been accepted to GSoC this year :(

2017-07-18T19:27:17 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: did you see this app that microsoft made, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai/
2017-07-18T19:27:58 <Justin_o> i tried it out a bit, it worked well sometimes and not all other times, but i could see how it could be really helpful when they iron out all the bugs
2017-07-18T19:38:28 <jhung> gtirloni sent a link to that earlier. It reminds me of Google Goggles.
2017-07-18T19:40:35 <jhung> But in true Google fashion, Goggles never really got past a "hey, neat idea" phase.
2017-07-18T19:41:53 <avtar> this looks pretty neat
2017-07-18T19:42:24 <avtar> i was getting a 404 earlier when i saw gtirloni\'s email
2017-07-18T19:43:06 <avtar> i would be curious to know what sort of privacy safeguards they\'re proposing for a service like this
