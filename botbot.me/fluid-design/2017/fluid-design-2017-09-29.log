2017-09-29T12:58:22 <Jess_> Caren_: did you see? http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/panelists-and-special-guests/
2017-09-29T12:58:27 <Jess_> OMG formatting was a nightmare
2017-09-29T12:59:02 <Caren_> looks amazing!
2017-09-29T12:59:03 <Jess_> it would be helpful if you would give it a look over Caren_  and make sure there aren\xe2\x80\x99t glaring mistakes
2017-09-29T12:59:34 <Caren_> I know, eh. getting the images to lineup with the copy\xe2\x80\xa6who knew it would be so difficult?
2017-09-29T12:59:48 <Jess_> Caren_: i seem to forget every year :(
2017-09-29T12:59:52 <Caren_> I wanted to put my hand inside the screen and move things around. hahah
2017-09-29T13:00:05 <Jess_> lol, good functionality if we could
2017-09-29T13:00:15 <Caren_> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it this afternoon.
2017-09-29T13:00:18 <Jess_> maybe next generation WordPress :)
2017-09-29T13:00:22 <Jess_> Caren_: thx!
2017-09-29T13:00:43 <Caren_> ya, touchscreen!
2017-09-29T13:01:06 <Jess_> well, we\xe2\x80\x99d still have the same formatting issue with touchscreen \xe2\x80\x94 this is crunky css and html
2017-09-29T13:01:16 <Jess_> in an ideal world someone would go in and fix up the stylesheet
2017-09-29T13:02:54 <Caren_> Yup

2017-09-29T19:16:52 <Caren_> everyone: an interesting way of personal storytelling. \xe2\x80\x9cBy collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends.\xe2\x80\x9d http://www.dear-data.com/theproject/
2017-09-29T19:19:01 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: ^

2017-09-29T19:24:41 <sepidehshahi> The legends and instructions are as cool\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-09-29T19:26:12 <Caren_> the idea of it becoming a ritual and translating their thoughts/activies into a visualization\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-09-29T19:26:30 <Caren_> the doing is always a challenge
2017-09-29T19:26:57 <Caren_> but the anticipation of sending and receiving can be motivation
2017-09-29T19:27:45 <Caren_> gorgeous pieces of art
2017-09-29T19:31:16 <sepidehshahi> absolutely! I want to sit down and decode these pieces, they are beautiful, playful and still not that hard or complicated to decipher. I love the week forty two! Laughter. Sorry I stop talking. the project is just so amazing
2017-09-29T19:32:50 <Caren_> Oh! I will look at 42 :-)
