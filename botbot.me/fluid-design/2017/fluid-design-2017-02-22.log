2017-02-22T15:01:16 <Caren> hi danayo. Where is the 10am meeting taking place?
2017-02-22T15:01:22 <Caren> :-)
2017-02-22T15:01:41 <danayo> let\'s meet in fluid standup Caren, Jess_, michelled
2017-02-22T15:02:06 <danayo> alanharnum ^ in case you\'re up to joining

2017-02-22T15:22:36 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: regarding the FD Tool\'s svgs, it seems that some were defined with a fill colour and others were not.. also some of the svgs have fills of different colours.. so we may need to institute some sort of best practice for creating them.
2017-02-22T15:22:52 <Justin_o> I\'m also trying to investigate if the build step can just clean that up, but so far no success
2017-02-22T15:26:25 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-02-22T15:30:35 <jhung> Justin_o: we could make a regex that catches those and filters it.
2017-02-22T15:31:46 <danayo> Justin_o: a best practices for creating them sounds good
2017-02-22T15:31:51 <danayo> jhung, what\'s a regex?
2017-02-22T15:34:07 <jhung> danayo: regex, or regular expression, is a programming syntax that lets you match strings within any arbitrary block of text. Using it we can find instances of "fill" etc in the SVG file and remove them programatically.
2017-02-22T15:36:34 <jhung> I think we should have both a best practice and some sort of method of automatically cleaning our SVGs.
2017-02-22T15:43:47 <danayo> that sounds good jhung, thanks

2017-02-22T16:49:38 <Justin_o> or just check in on where things are at?
2017-02-22T16:50:19 <danayo> Justin_o: sure, can I ping you a bit later?
2017-02-22T16:50:57 <Justin_o> danayo: sure whenever should be fine
2017-02-22T16:51:03 <danayo> great

2017-02-22T18:48:53 <jhung> Justin_o: do you recall if you recorded a video of the PhET Wave on a String / Nexus hackathon we did?
2017-02-22T18:49:29 <Justin_o> I didn\'t, i think you recorded a video on your phone, but that was all

2017-02-22T18:54:26 <jhung> hmmm. I only recall recording videos of the John Travoltage one. I\'ll search my drive and see if I have anything from that day.
2017-02-22T18:55:24 <Justin_o> oh my mistake, yes i think that\'s correct
2017-02-22T18:55:31 <Justin_o> i don\'t recall filming the other one
2017-02-22T18:58:35 * cindyli has quit
2017-02-22T19:00:11 <jhung> How easy do you think it would be to set up that demo again Justin_o? Didn\'t me make a fork / repo for it somewhere?
2017-02-22T19:00:33 <Justin_o> jhung: alanharnum might have that somewhere
2017-02-22T19:04:10 <jhung> Ah. According to an email convo back in July 25, we didn\'t have a video recorded of it Justin_o. We should definitely see about getting it set up again because it\'s a very cool proof of concept.
2017-02-22T19:04:52 <Justin_o> jhung: i wonder if actually Jesse made that integration
2017-02-22T19:05:38 <jhung> Good question! I\'m not sure Justin_o. I guess he will be hard to get hold of unless I make an unplanned trip. :)
2017-02-22T19:06:24 <Justin_o> jhung: https://github.com/phetsims/wave-on-a-string/tree/nexus
2017-02-22T19:06:39 <Justin_o> +1 for roadtrip
2017-02-22T19:07:19 <jhung> Justin_o: awesome! Now how do we build it and get it running?
2017-02-22T19:07:46 <Justin_o> jhung: good question.. that will require us to figure out how to build the sim, plus get the nexus dependencies setup
2017-02-22T19:07:53 <Justin_o> jhung: when do you need that for
2017-02-22T19:08:45 <jhung> Emily was asking about it. She was hoping to show a video tomorrow, but I don\'t think that\'ll be feasible Justin_o

2017-02-22T22:19:11 <danayo> thanks Caren, got it - could you add the background image (ripped paper) in the folder too?
2017-02-22T22:20:29 <Caren> sure. It\xe2\x80\x99s watermarked b/c I haven\xe2\x80\x99t purchased it yet.
2017-02-22T22:21:10 <danayo> ok
2017-02-22T22:22:05 <Caren> oh, wait. I copied on screen in iStock and then placed directly into the AI working file\xe2\x80\xa6so there is no source file for the ripped paper. \xe2\x80\xa6. not until it\xe2\x80\x99s purchased.
2017-02-22T22:22:30 <Caren> You\xe2\x80\x99ll see it has a masking and some patching to hide the watermarks
2017-02-22T22:23:12 <danayo> ok - when i open the illustrator file it can\'t find the image
2017-02-22T22:23:27 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m in my room if you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to make some sense of how I built it
2017-02-22T22:23:44 <Caren> at least try to make some sense :-)
