2017-10-23T13:36:07 <Justin_o> for the designers section i'm not sure it's accurate,
2017-10-23T13:37:35 <jhung> Justin_o: sure I'll take a look.

2017-10-23T15:09:30 <jhung> fluid-everyone: does anyone have something they'd like to talk about for tomorrow's design crit? If there isn't anything, i was hoping to go over the Design OwnCloud permissions and revisit the design workflow and see how people feel about it.
2017-10-23T15:09:49 <grrrero> jhung: Sounds good to me
2017-10-23T15:09:54 <sepidehshahi> I have nothing jhung
2017-10-23T15:10:33 <grrrero> jhung: At some point tho I wanted to ask if for one of the upcoming design crits could be used to gain feedback/ideas on an article my friend and I were going to write about inclusive design to the Ontario Planning Journal?

2017-10-23T15:14:10 <jhung> grrrero: sounds good! Let me know when you want to do that.
2017-10-23T15:15:40 <grrrero> jhung: Ok cool thanks :D
2017-10-23T15:30:54 <grrrero> jhung: Justin_o and I were talking and we wanted to ask if there's time at design crit tomorrow to talk about UIO?
2017-10-23T15:31:20 <grrrero> We wanted to ask everyone's feedback on how the breadcrumbs (knowing which panel you are on) and the description tooltip should appear or behave in UIO
2017-10-23T15:36:57 <jhung> hey grrrero sorry just saw this message now. I had already sent out the email. But if there's time we can definitely talk about breadcrumbs.
2017-10-23T15:37:24 <grrrero> Ok cool thanks jhung
2017-10-23T15:51:25 <michelled> grrrero: you've probably already found this, but if not maybe it could help with what you're working on with Jutta: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Platform+Cooperativism
2017-10-23T15:51:45 <grrrero> michelled: Ohhhh awesome thanks Michelle! I'd not seen this beforehand
2017-10-23T15:52:24 <michelled> np also, you probably want to chat with Caren when you get a chance since she's been the most involved in the platform co-op work so far
