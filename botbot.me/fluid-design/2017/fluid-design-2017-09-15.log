b"2017-09-15T21:05:24 <colinclark> I wonder what we could do to finish this up
2017-09-15T21:05:30 <colinclark> I love that you took the time to do a spike
2017-09-15T21:05:56 <colinclark> and maybe we could write up some JIRAs and get some fixes and improvements merged in
2017-09-15T21:06:17 <colinclark> something maybe you could look at once the responsive work is done on UIO, grrrero
2017-09-15T21:06:39 <colinclark> So much good work happening on UIO right now
2017-09-15T21:06:43 <colinclark> avtar's new video
2017-09-15T21:06:50 <colinclark> the responsiveness from grrrero
2017-09-15T21:06:57 <colinclark> justin_o's browser extension
2017-09-15T21:07:02 <colinclark> and now alanharnum's RTL support
2017-09-15T21:07:11 <colinclark> super exciting
2017-09-15T21:07:12 <alanharnum> it definitely needs some documentation work, if nothing else; I am not actually sure the documentation at http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/LocalizationInThePreferencesFramework.html is correct about how to manage languages
2017-09-15T21:07:22 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2017-09-15T21:07:24 <colinclark> how so, alanharnum?
2017-09-15T21:07:26 <gmoss> alanharnum: your French machine translation is pretty good! I also really like the RTL support for the Farsi, very cool :)
2017-09-15T21:07:59 <alanharnum> colinclark: it's possible I was misunderstanding, but what's described at http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/LocalizationInThePreferencesFramework.html#specifying-a-localization did not appear to work
2017-09-15T21:08:21 <colinclark> What did work, alanharnum?
2017-09-15T21:08:42 <alanharnum> colinclark: modifying the messageLoader directly to set the locale
2017-09-15T21:08:48 <colinclark> aha
2017-09-15T21:08:49 <alanharnum> I'm having another look at it now
2017-09-15T21:17:18 <alanharnum> colinclark: https://github.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual#possible-documentation-issue
2017-09-15T21:17:40 <alanharnum> what is described in the documentation (unless I am reading it incorrectly) actually appears to cause an error if used
2017-09-15T21:18:18 <michelled> alanharnum: it seems to me that if you are interpreting it that way, we should change it regardless
2017-09-15T21:18:39 <colinclark> yeah, sounds like we should file a JIRA
2017-09-15T21:18:42 <alanharnum> hm, actually, I think it is a side effect of my renaming the message bundles so they've all got lang extensions
2017-09-15T21:18:53 <colinclark> ah
2017-09-15T21:19:44 <alanharnum> it's still not working to set the locale, but it doesn't cause an error if there are bundles in the form of '<bundlename>.json'

2017-09-15T17:01:57 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung, I was wondering if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to use UIO for non-english websites particularly for languages that are written right to left like Farsi
2017-09-15T17:03:32 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-15T17:17:03 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I think it can be done by changing the text strings in the message bundle.
2017-09-15T17:17:04 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: UIO can be localized to other languages; that\'s a built-in feature described here http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/LocalizationInThePreferencesFramework.html
2017-09-15T17:17:24 <alanharnum> it is possible for maximum comprehension that you\'d want custom markup for a right-to-left script like Farsi
2017-09-15T17:17:26 * Caren_ has quit
2017-09-15T17:18:23 <alanharnum> this is actually a UI convention I\'m curious about, sepidehshahi - does the right-to-left reading convention apply for things like UI elements that decrease/increase, or similar?
2017-09-15T17:19:04 <sepidehshahi> yes alanharnum
2017-09-15T17:22:50 <alanharnum> ah this is really useful: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/building-rtl-aware-web-apps-and-websites-part-1/
2017-09-15T17:23:36 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m not very familar with the associate efforts for changing the markups. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to convince someone to include UIO in their site. Do you think integrating UIO with changing markups is reasonably easy or does it require large time investments alanharnum ?
2017-09-15T17:25:22 <sepidehshahi> This is great alanharnum, thanks I hope this can be done
2017-09-15T17:25:49 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I don\'t think the effort would be TOO great compared to just regular UIO. Let me do an experiment real quick.
2017-09-15T17:36:52 <jhung> gtirloni: fyi, I just sent out an email about the BIG IDeA site. To get the theme back into a github repo, I\'m going to change everyone except you and me to Subscriber roles. This way I don\'t have to worry about the theme changing while I\'m doing the work.
2017-09-15T17:39:29 <gtirloni> awesome, that\'s good
2017-09-15T17:45:20 * Caren_ joined the channel
2017-09-15T17:48:57 <Caren_> sepidehshahi, alanharnum: was reading through your UIO convo and it go me thinking that it would be great to recommend UIO for the INVICTUS site: http://www.invictusgames2017.com/
2017-09-15T17:50:20 <Caren_> Is there documentation to point them to?
2017-09-15T17:57:15 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: michelled just shared with me this wiki page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UI+Options+Wordpres+Plugin+Development+Guide
2017-09-15T17:57:40 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if this is the right documentation though. jhung might know better
2017-09-15T17:58:02 <michelled> Caren_: if they aren\'t using WordPress, then these are the docs: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html
2017-09-15T17:58:43 <michelled> alanharnum: did Avtar\'s video get posted? that would be perfect :)_
2017-09-15T17:59:02 <alanharnum> michelled: no, I haven\'t posted it yet - but will do so now, thank you for reminder!
2017-09-15T17:59:30 <michelled> thank you!
2017-09-15T18:00:07 <Caren_> thanks sepidehshahi and michelled! does the video relate to the UIO?
2017-09-15T18:00:37 <michelled> Caren_: yes, it shows how to integrate UIO on a webpage
2017-09-15T18:00:46 <michelled> using the sojustrepair page as an example
2017-09-15T18:00:56 <sepidehshahi> awesome1 thanks
2017-09-15T18:01:15 <Caren_> awesome +1 :-)
2017-09-15T18:02:53 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: so, a quick experiment shows that changing the text direction of the UIO frame\'s markup does some of what is necessary: https://imgur.com/a/ZZ2VU
2017-09-15T18:03:06 <alanharnum> you can see that the slider and text boxes change direction appropriately, etc
2017-09-15T18:03:50 <alanharnum> what I think would be required (along with translation of the message strings to Farsi) would be a custom RTL style / markup to do things like reverse where the small / large A is in the text size box.
2017-09-15T18:04:49 <sepidehshahi> did you just make this alanharnum? you are amazing! Thanks so much I\xe2\x80\x99ll share all these notes with the person who is working on that site. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know how it goes.
2017-09-15T18:06:55 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I will try and knock together a quick demo - this is actually work we\'ll need to do for SJRK localization
2017-09-15T18:07:53 <sepidehshahi> That would be super helpful!
2017-09-15T18:08:11 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: if you felt like doing a quick Farsi translation of https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/365e884f4e572a26bbed9d8f6f8bd4f5ab0e0895/src/framework/preferences/messages I can see about doing an RTL UIO demo.
2017-09-15T18:08:42 <alanharnum> (that directory is the English-language message strings that get used to render the interfaces)
2017-09-15T18:10:11 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: do you mean translating the directory? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which part I should translate but I can certainly do it
2017-09-15T18:10:45 <alanharnum> sepideshahi: sorry - being unclear. the text in the individual files like https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/365e884f4e572a26bbed9d8f6f8bd4f5ab0e0895/src/framework/preferences/messages/contrast.json would need to be translated
2017-09-15T18:12:06 <sepidehshahi> for sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it next weekend.
2017-09-15T18:13:01 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: sure, no rush - I think it would be a really useful demo
2017-09-15T18:13:09 <alanharnum> and it is relevant to the SJRK work
2017-09-15T18:13:53 <sepidehshahi> It\xe2\x80\x99s not actually that much, I just went through it I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it ready by Monday. and thank you so much for making the demo :)
2017-09-15T18:17:25 <michelled> as alanharnum mentioned, it good for both Floe and SJRK - so feel free to do this at work, sepidehshahi
2017-09-15T18:17:52 <alanharnum> we get this question quite a lot about UIO
2017-09-15T18:18:09 <alanharnum> and the current documentation is a bit sparse
2017-09-15T18:18:39 <alanharnum> so it would be good to have a demo, sample code, and clearer instructions on how to use non-English versions of UIO
2017-09-15T18:18:50 <alanharnum> and would make it easier to (FE) crowd-source translations for it

2017-09-15T19:37:50 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: thanks! I\'ve actually got a demo almost working that I can plug these into - can you also translate the word "Reset" into Farsi for me?
2017-09-15T19:39:06 <sepidehshahi> sure
2017-09-15T19:39:12 <Caren_> jhung: the DEEP agenda is reading so much better. The \xe2\x80\x9cpretty\xe2\x80\x9d is the wonderful scanability and organization of the content!
2017-09-15T19:39:55 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: also these two phrases: "Hello, World!" and "Welcome to the UIO Multilingual Demo." :)
2017-09-15T19:40:41 <sepidehshahi> for sure!
2017-09-15T19:42:01 <Caren_> I would like to learn about the language in the Text edit window. For example I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know how to remove bolding in a line while keeping the time (9:15 for example) bold.

2017-09-15T19:43:51 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: Did you translate UIO\'s strings!? :)
2017-09-15T19:44:09 <colinclark> and alanharnum, are you implementing RTL support?
2017-09-15T19:44:11 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: just the messages
2017-09-15T19:44:16 <colinclark> amazing
2017-09-15T19:44:29 <alanharnum> colinclark: RTL support is actually super easy - I think it mostly just works
2017-09-15T19:44:42 <alanharnum> you set the "dir" to RTL, and the components seem to respond accordingly
2017-09-15T19:45:03 <alanharnum> we may have to do some style tweaking, but it looked pretty OK to me
2017-09-15T19:45:22 <jhung> Caren_: no prob. Your mock-up helped a lot.
2017-09-15T19:45:41 <alanharnum> RTL support is mainly a matter of maintaining a separate directory of RTL-friendly templates

2017-09-15T20:24:37 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi colinclark: not perfect, but I think quite promising for time invested: http://rawgit.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual/master/demos/index_fa.html
2017-09-15T20:25:54 <alanharnum> (sepidehshahi, I Google translated the last two phrases I needed, please forgive me :) - I will replace with your translations when you have a chance)
2017-09-15T20:26:46 <alanharnum> for comparison, http://rawgit.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual/master/demos/index_fr.html (Google translated for now) and http://rawgit.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual/master/demos/index_en.html

2017-09-15T21:01:08 <colinclark> I\'m really impressed, alanharnum
2017-09-15T21:01:09 <colinclark> nice work
2017-09-15T21:01:37 <alanharnum> colinclark: thanks - it does show how well-architected the prefs framework is that this was pretty easy
2017-09-15T21:01:48 <colinclark> that\'s really good to know
2017-09-15T21:03:35 <alanharnum> what I think would be needed to make this more "production ready" (w/e) that means is better styles for RTL layout (you\'ll notice the icons are crammed up against the headings, etc), and a way of detecting page language in the prefs editor frame
2017-09-15T21:03:50 <colinclark> right
2017-09-15T21:04:03 <colinclark> so largely it\'s an issue of styling, rather than rearrangement of the markup?
2017-09-15T21:04:06 <alanharnum> that would let you do language-specific customizations via CSS, like replacing the Latin characters when dealing with non-Latin scripts
2017-09-15T21:04:29 <alanharnum> it seems so, yeah - RTL page flow does exactly what you\'d expect, and seems to do it pretty well
