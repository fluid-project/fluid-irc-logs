2017-10-02T15:00:26 <danayo> sepidehshahi: thanks for adding your notes to the MyL3 page!
2017-10-02T15:01:11 <sepidehshahi> no worries :)
2017-10-02T15:02:27 <gmoss> jessm: Very cool! I\'m interested by the implications of IP law on the archival process, and how different jurisdictions might affect that. It\'s a noble idea, all the same. So much of our world is documented these days, it\'s basically panopticon, but so much of that content can be ephemeral, especially for authors who wish to revise and redact things that were previously shared. I mean yeah the internet never
2017-10-02T15:02:27 <gmoss> forgets, but it\'s all about how you index it and how accessible it is. </stream-of-consciousness>
2017-10-02T15:03:23 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything else for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s design crit, danayo and I would like to share our MyL3 designs with the team.
2017-10-02T15:03:28 <jessm> gmoss: good streams :) they have a pretty hefty list of collaborators and digital librarians and copyright folks \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m hoping they\xe2\x80\x99ll tackle the hard stuff!
2017-10-02T15:05:23 <jhung> sepidehshahi: that sounds good. Currently there is nothing scheduled.
2017-10-02T15:05:27 <danayo> that\'s really cool jessm
2017-10-02T15:07:53 <jessm> danayo: they are doing some really nice work and their website looks great, they are actively publishing on medium and their github page is really nicely organized. colour me impressed!
2017-10-02T15:12:17 <danayo> cool jessm. it seems to be focussed on Twitter? I guess because it\'s public - but I wonder about Facebook as well - if there is a way to collect data there too - it\'s something that came up with the biodiversity project
2017-10-02T15:14:47 <jessm> danayo: ahhh, interesting \xe2\x80\x94 they have a slack channel \xe2\x80\x94 maybe go in there and ask?
2017-10-02T15:15:59 <jessm> danayo: did you take a look at their CoC?
2017-10-02T15:16:05 <jessm> interesting: Documenting the Now prioritizes marginalized people\xe2\x80\x99s safety over privileged people\xe2\x80\x99s comfort. RESPONSE TEAM will not act on complaints regarding:
2017-10-02T15:16:06 <jessm> Reverse-isms, including reverse racism, reverse sexism, and cisphobia
2017-10-02T15:16:07 <jessm> Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I\'m not discussing this with you."
2017-10-02T15:16:08 <jessm> Communicating in a tone you don\xe2\x80\x99t find congenial
2017-10-02T15:16:09 <jessm> Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
2017-10-02T15:17:41 <danayo> interesting jessm, where did you find it?
2017-10-02T15:18:18 <jessm> danayo: so, it\xe2\x80\x99s in their github repo front -n- centre and it\xe2\x80\x99s also at the registration page for their slack channel. so thoughtful \xe2\x80\x94 i love that they\xe2\x80\x99re putting things in the right places!

2017-10-02T15:48:54 <Justin_o> danayo: hello, would you like to talk about all about icons for letter spacing.. i\'m not sure if there was something already developed for those or not
2017-10-02T15:49:44 <danayo> Justin_o: let me take a look - I know I worked on some of those for a bit and then we dropped it
2017-10-02T15:49:52 <Justin_o> ah okay
2017-10-02T15:50:09 <danayo> the other one is a replacement for the small A / large A for text size, right?
2017-10-02T15:50:53 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, something to use for those types of icons
2017-10-02T15:51:34 <danayo> based on the discussion around language/localization, right?
2017-10-02T15:51:52 <danayo> Justin_o^
2017-10-02T15:54:58 <Justin_o> danayo: oh right forgot about that.. i had talked to sepidehshahi a bit about that before, i\'m not sure if that\'s an issue or not
2017-10-02T15:55:19 <Justin_o> but localizing icons could be something to think about as well

2017-10-02T16:26:26 <jessm> sepidehshahi: interesting stuff for sure!
2017-10-02T17:17:40 <danayo> jessm: it looks like you sorted out a bunch of the DEEP volunteer needs on Friday - are there particular gaps you\'re looking to fill?
2017-10-02T17:17:56 <jessm> danayo: there are many gaps
2017-10-02T17:18:03 <jessm> gaps everywhere
2017-10-02T17:18:10 <danayo> I\'m interested in learning diff as well as platform coops
2017-10-02T17:18:19 <danayo> also very happy to run with a mic
2017-10-02T17:18:30 <jessm> danayo: platform coops needs you!
2017-10-02T17:18:49 <jessm> danayo: i have this fear of falling up stairs \xe2\x80\x94 you sure you\xe2\x80\x99re ok running with a mic?!
2017-10-02T17:19:06 <danayo> are you projecting your fear onto me jessm :D
2017-10-02T17:19:15 <jessm> danayo: i might be\xe2\x80\xa6 yes!
2017-10-02T17:19:42 <danayo> I just won\'t wear heels that day jessm
2017-10-02T17:19:56 <jessm> danayo: sensible shoes FTW
2017-10-02T17:20:22 <danayo> sensible and serious  d:)
2017-10-02T17:21:14 <danayo> so for platform coop - what exactly do you need?

2017-10-02T17:21:40 <danayo> jessm
2017-10-02T17:22:04 <jessm> danayo: NOT platform shoes for one
2017-10-02T17:22:08 <danayo> har
2017-10-02T17:22:13 <jessm> danayo: we need a moderator, a provocateur
2017-10-02T17:23:08 <danayo> ok, I\'m more happy to moderate than to provoke
2017-10-02T17:23:17 <jessm> danayo: done!
2017-10-02T17:23:55 <danayo> perfect

2017-10-02T18:58:04 <danayo> and I think Caren might have also done some work but I don\'t see a file here
2017-10-02T18:58:43 <danayo> so letter/character spacing is in there
