2017-06-07T17:55:13 <Jess_> clown: ping
2017-06-07T18:02:20 <clown> Jess_ pong
2017-06-07T18:05:28 <Jess_> clown: sorry, just jumping into the ISO stuff now \xe2\x80\x94 how can i help? do you have a spreadsheet started?
2017-06-07T18:07:42 <clown> Jess_:   which ISO stuff?  I\'ve been working on the OPC/privacy documents.   The other thing that we briefly discussed last Fri (?) I haven\'t had any time for.
2017-06-07T18:07:58 <Jess_> ah, ok, that\xe2\x80\x99s an answer
2017-06-07T18:08:04 <Jess_> clown: i\xe2\x80\x99m going to dig into it now
2017-06-07T18:08:17 <Jess_> i thought you mentioned ISO at standup
2017-06-07T18:08:20 <clown> the OPC/Privacy also has work to do for ISO.
2017-06-07T18:08:46 <Jess_> ah, i see
2017-06-07T18:08:47 <clown> Both a NWI (new work item) and a CD1 (not sure exaclty what "CD1" means).
2017-06-07T18:09:15 <clown> but it is some ISO standard for privacy.
2017-06-07T18:09:33 <clown> well, privacy *preferences* to be exact
2017-06-07T18:10:11 <clown> So, go ahead and dig into the other one.  Thanks!

2017-06-07T20:13:17 <clown> that\'s Kathryn\'s going away lunch at noon.
2017-06-07T20:14:06 <michelled> clown: any time tomorrow works for me
2017-06-07T20:18:05 <clown> michelled:  I\'ll suggest 10:15 am  edt tomorrow, but see if cindyli (oh she\'s disconnected) and danayo confirm if they see this.   Time for an email.

2017-06-07T20:21:18 <danayo> sorry clown just sorting out some SJRK meeting times
2017-06-07T20:21:28 <danayo> 10:15 ET tomorrow should be fine
2017-06-07T20:22:06 <clown> thanks danayo.  I just sent an email in that regard.  You can ignore if you like.
2017-06-07T20:22:26 <clown> ah, I see cindy standing next to Justin \xe2\x80\xa6  brb
2017-06-07T20:24:51 <alanharnum> danayo: yes, that time works for me
2017-06-07T20:25:39 <danayo> thanks alanharnum
2017-06-07T20:25:54 <clown> michelled, danayo: cindy is involved in an APCP meeting all day, so we should go ahead without her.
2017-06-07T20:26:11 <clown> she will look over the document and discuss with me if she sees anything.
2017-06-07T20:26:52 <clown> alanharnum:  are you going to attend too?
2017-06-07T20:27:20 <clown> I\'m referring to your "yes, that time works for me"
2017-06-07T20:27:28 <alanharnum> clown: sorry, no, that\'s for another meeting
2017-06-07T20:28:01 <clown> ah.  IMs passing/colliding in the ether
