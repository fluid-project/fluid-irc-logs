2017-02-15T15:16:46 <Justin_o> danayo: what do you think of this version of the on/off toggle https://jsfiddle.net/zxm507Lg/11/
2017-02-15T15:17:16 <Justin_o> it should work on FF, IE 11, and Edge.. but there is a slight shift in the width when switching between states
2017-02-15T15:17:42 <colinclark> Justin_o: those are some nice on/off switches you\'ve got :)
2017-02-15T15:17:42 <Justin_o> as of yet, i\'ve been unable to get that fixed in a way that works across browser
2017-02-15T15:18:08 <danayo> Justin_o: tjue
2017-02-15T15:18:13 <danayo> oops!
2017-02-15T15:18:23 <danayo> the toggle looks great
2017-02-15T15:19:18 <danayo> even in Firefox!
2017-02-15T15:19:50 <Justin_o> danayo: :) thanks
2017-02-15T15:21:33 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'ll try to get this working in the prefs framework now, hopefully there won\'t be any styling conflicts with what\'s there.
2017-02-15T15:22:14 <danayo> great Justin_o, fingers crossed

2017-02-15T17:31:53 <danayo> jhung, alanharnum, Caren, colinclark : how about Friday? (to discuss accessible prototyping options)?

2017-02-15T19:01:11 <jhung> danayo, Caren - an interesting privacy related issue I found with Creative Cloud. There\'s no way to opt-out of data sharing with Adobe because we\'re not the account holders.
2017-02-15T19:01:49 <jhung> I mean, we\'re not the administrators / license holders.
2017-02-15T19:02:35 <danayo> interesting jhung
2017-02-15T19:04:09 <jhung> I don\'t think any of the design artifacts we work on contain confidential information, but it\'s still something to be aware of just in case.
2017-02-15T19:04:51 <Caren> is that because the IDRC doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold the account?
2017-02-15T19:05:59 <jhung> Caren: Yes, I suspect that\'s the case. OCAD IT would be the ones to address this I would think.
2017-02-15T19:06:20 <jhung> If it\'s an issue, we should probably ask them to disable that for our profiiles.
2017-02-15T19:07:44 <Caren> hmmm, shall we put this on the agenda for discussion at our Friday 1pm EST meeting?

2017-02-15T19:14:02 <jhung> danayo, Justin_o, Caren - if you\'re interested in seeing the FAQ on data sharing, see here https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/faq.html#Basics
2017-02-15T19:15:56 <Justin_o> jhung: i hope the admins have disabled it for our self-installs
2017-02-15T19:17:06 <jhung> Justin_o: I don\'t know. There should be an option for privacy under our Account Settings, but there\'s nothing there.
2017-02-15T19:19:08 <jhung> "Adobe may also share your personal information:
2017-02-15T19:19:08 <jhung> \t\xe2\x80\xa2\tWhen you agreed to the sharing
2017-02-15T19:19:08 <jhung> \t\xe2\x80\xa2\tWithin the Adobe family of companies for purposes described in this privacy policy (see a list of https://www.adobe.com/ca/about-adobe/contact/offices.html and our https://www.adobe.com/ca/privacy/policies.html)

2017-02-15T19:19:09 <jhung> \t\xe2\x80\xa2\tWhen we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or respond to fraud, defend our apps or websites against attacks, or protect the property and safety of Adobe, our customers and users, or the public
2017-02-15T19:19:09 <jhung> \t\xe2\x80\xa2\tIf we merge with or are acquired by another company, sell an Adobe website, app, or business unit, or if all or a substantial portion of our assets are acquired by another company. In those cases your information will likely be one of the assets that is transferred"
2017-02-15T19:22:16 <Justin_o> jhung: it says it\'s automatically disabled for enterprise users though, i imagine that some of the installs are like that here, so maybe it\'s off already ?
2017-02-15T19:22:48 <jhung> Oh maybe? That would make me feel much better Justin_o. Where did you read that?

2017-02-15T19:30:17 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-02-15T19:30:18 <Justin_o> it says
2017-02-15T19:30:25 <Justin_o> "If administrators install applications via Creative Cloud Packager using Enterprise IDs, the ability to share information with Adobe about using Creative Cloud desktop applications is disabled for members of the following: Creative Cloud for teams, Creative Cloud for enterprise, and Creative Cloud for education. It cannot be enabled.
2017-02-15T19:30:25 <Justin_o> However, if administrators let users install Creative Cloud applications via the Creative Cloud for desktop app using an Adobe ID, users can share information about how they use the applications. Users can change these preferences at any time by visiting their Account Management page."
