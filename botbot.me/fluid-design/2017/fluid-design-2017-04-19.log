2017-04-19T19:06:48 <cindyli> hi danayo, do you have some time to talk about UIO mobile design after the community meeting?
2017-04-19T19:07:58 <danayo> cindyli: i\'m going to meet with colin first - will ping you if I have time after that (have to leave for an appt at 5ET) - if not, how about tomorrow morning?
2017-04-19T19:08:28 <cindyli> sure, danayo. let\'s do it tomorrow morning. what time is good for u?
2017-04-19T19:08:50 <danayo> any time after 10ET cindyli
2017-04-19T19:09:17 <cindyli> 10:30ET? danayo
2017-04-19T19:12:28 <danayo> ok cindyli
2017-04-19T19:13:13 <cindyli> actually, danayo, after reading justin\'s comment, we may not need to meet tomorrow. I\'ll post my question here and you can answer when you have time.
2017-04-19T19:13:21 <cindyli> according to the UIO mobile design: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=137658573
2017-04-19T19:13:32 <cindyli> moving in between UIO panels is by touching "<" to go to the previous panel and ">" to go to the next panel.
2017-04-19T19:13:49 <cindyli> from justin\'s comment: adjuster panels for mobile version may require horizontal scrolling to view all of their contents. This is a design decision that https://github.com/dayotte and myself discussed
2017-04-19T19:14:39 <cindyli> instead of implementing < and > for mobile devices, scrolling to view was decided for moving around panels, right?
2017-04-19T19:23:00 <cindyli> our comments are here - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/825
2017-04-19T19:23:37 <cindyli> justin\'s one is the 3rd point in the first comment. my question is the last comment at the bottom of this page
