2017-02-07T18:52:47 <Bosmon> perhaps he\'s working from home too
2017-02-07T18:53:06 <Justin_o> he\'s at the office, i can see him in our planning meeting right now :) I\'ll try to ask him about it

2017-02-07T18:58:06 <Justin_o> alanharn_: for the chart authoring work, did you encounter a need to handle the precision of decimal numbers... e.g. 1.2. vs 1.2000000000000002
2017-02-07T18:58:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - pretty interesting discussion on this on stackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11832914/round-to-at-most-2-decimal-places/12830454#12830454
2017-02-07T18:58:29 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-02-07T18:58:32 <Bosmon> Which suggests to me that we have never tried to deal with this issue before : P
2017-02-07T18:59:04 <Bosmon> The fact that parseFloat("1.555").toFixed(2) produces the wrong answer is pretty hilarious

2017-02-07T19:01:00 <Jess_> thanks danayo this helps put into context JT talking about a barn raising this a.m.
2017-02-07T19:01:01 <Jess_> :P
2017-02-07T19:02:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: lol
2017-02-07T19:03:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i thought you had code to handle this before though
2017-02-07T19:03:24 * clown joined the channel
2017-02-07T19:03:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the code we have is just there to cause the model relay calculation to stabilise
2017-02-07T19:03:49 <Bosmon> There isn\'t anything that does the job of rendering numerical values in a human-readable form
2017-02-07T19:04:57 <Bosmon> In particular we have this calculation here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L1094
2017-02-07T19:06:18 <Justin_o> perhaps that was the code i was thinking of
2017-02-07T19:06:28 <Bosmon> Which would indeed consider that "1.2000000000000002" was the same number as "1.2" (if the latter had a distinct floating-point representation, which it doesn\'t)
2017-02-07T19:06:57 <Bosmon> But this wouldn\'t help you in displaying such a number to the user
2017-02-07T19:07:22 <alanharnum> Justin_o: the code at https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/657233685c3abd897409f881f78726ea3555d54a/src/js/percentage.js does this
2017-02-07T19:07:51 <Bosmon> Ah, thanks alanharnum
2017-02-07T19:08:00 <alanharnum> using this method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
2017-02-07T19:08:11 <alanharnum> "The toFixed() method formats a number using fixed-point notation."
2017-02-07T19:08:59 <Justin_o> alanharnum: interestingly Bosmon posted a stackoverflow discussion that shows it isn\'t always accurate ;(
2017-02-07T19:09:14 <alanharnum> yes, that doesn\'t surprise me
2017-02-07T19:09:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon, alanharnum: is it enough though.. is it possible to be 100% accurate given the state of things in the environment?
2017-02-07T19:09:34 <alanharnum> whenever i hate how core JS handles dates, i should also remember it also has things to hate about basic mathematical functions
2017-02-07T19:10:02 <alanharnum> I wonder if https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toPrecision is any better
2017-02-07T19:10:31 <alanharnum> though it appears the main difference is return type (string vs. number)
2017-02-07T19:11:08 <Bosmon> alanharnum - seems unlikely - since it looks like the "bug" is in the ECMAScript standard
2017-02-07T19:11:19 <Bosmon> i.e. in that it does not bother to specify exactly what these methods should do : P
2017-02-07T19:12:48 <Bosmon> Well ok, it does describe what they should do
2017-02-07T19:12:55 <Bosmon> https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.7.4.5
2017-02-07T19:13:07 <Bosmon> As one correspondent has noted, "It describes something fairly obtusely"
2017-02-07T19:14:44 * simonjb has quit
2017-02-07T19:15:34 <Bosmon> For Justin_o \'s use case, any of these implementations would be good enough
2017-02-07T19:16:07 <Bosmon> But given we\'re giving some attention to the issue, it would be pleasant to have an implementation that considers that "1.555" to 2 decimal places is "1.56" as every child learns in school

2017-02-07T19:29:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess I\'d take a 2-line snippet of junk with 1642 upvotes on stackoverflow rather than a 2-line snippet of junk sitting in npm with no README or docs :)
2017-02-07T19:29:49 <Bosmon> oh wow
2017-02-07T19:29:55 <Bosmon> And one that has been there for all of 6 days :)
2017-02-07T19:30:07 <Bosmon> Talk about "many eyeballs" ...
2017-02-07T19:32:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it did get to version 2 in 8 commits
2017-02-07T19:34:56 <Bosmon> Impressive!
2017-02-07T19:35:24 <Bosmon> If it had even a single test case, it might be a little more impressive : P

2017-02-07T19:45:42 <Bosmon> Who knows, if we produce enough test cases, we might be able to check that the npm module\'s solution is better
2017-02-07T19:45:51 <Bosmon> Certainly this SO snippet could be much better factored
2017-02-07T19:47:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m getting lost in all the "math" going on in these
2017-02-07T19:48:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s amazing how complicated it is to convince the javascript to do something that seems so simple
2017-02-07T19:50:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, there\'s nothing simple about floating point representation :)
2017-02-07T19:50:33 <Bosmon> Just because there\'s a lot of it about, doesn\'t mean that we understand it
2017-02-07T19:52:41 <Bosmon> The SO guy at least has a kind of "interactive test cases" which gains him points even if his algorithm is cumbersome and suspect

2017-02-07T19:55:32 <Justin_o> i just mean if you asked someone to do the task you could probably get them to do it in their head, but trying to work out the formulas needed to do it computationally isn\'t as simple
2017-02-07T20:01:04 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I\'m thinking about how I\'d end up doing the task in my head, and realizing I\'d basically be running a reduce function until I hit the desired # of digits of precision
2017-02-07T20:01:13 <alanharnum> moving right to left along the number
2017-02-07T20:02:07 <alanharnum> 1.3867 > 1.387 > 1.39
2017-02-07T20:02:51 <alanharnum> it\'s a bit weird to actually think about what my process is
2017-02-07T20:03:05 <Justin_o> yah, because you probably don\'t even think about most of that
2017-02-07T20:03:20 <Justin_o> consciously that is
2017-02-07T20:04:34 <alanharnum> i\'m sure if I go back far enough there\'s endless worksheets that drilled that process into me as "how you round a non-whole number".
2017-02-07T20:09:22 <alanharnum> No one seems to be aware of Number.EPSILON.
2017-02-07T20:09:25 <alanharnum> http://stackoverflow.com/a/41716722/6331308
2017-02-07T20:09:33 <alanharnum> Above should have been quoted
2017-02-07T20:09:45 <alanharnum> I was not aware of Number.EPSILON
2017-02-07T20:09:51 <alanharnum> but I am now!
2017-02-07T20:11:44 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i hadn\'t heard of it before either
2017-02-07T20:11:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2017-02-07T20:12:17 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2017-02-07T20:13:05 <Bosmon> That answer is not good
2017-02-07T20:13:09 <alanharnum> thanks, 1-upvote question, for teaching me something new!
2017-02-07T20:13:45 <Bosmon> Yes, even a 1-upvote question can teach SOMETHING :)
2017-02-07T20:14:13 <Bosmon> But relative to the question asked, the answer is faulty because it fails to adjust epsilon with respect to the magnitude of the input number
2017-02-07T20:14:31 <Bosmon> If I had any SO cred, I would downvote it :)
2017-02-07T20:15:20 <Bosmon> Number.EPSILON is at best a wacky, poorly-supported curiosity....
2017-02-07T20:15:46 <Bosmon> Actually the MDN page on it is actively dangerous
2017-02-07T20:15:51 <Bosmon> SInce it suggests that it should be used!
2017-02-07T20:16:09 <Bosmon> Look at that bogus equality testing code
2017-02-07T20:16:41 <Bosmon> Wow, this is really terrible

2017-02-07T17:33:59 <Justin_o> what should the disabled state of the button look like
2017-02-07T17:34:11 <Justin_o> i\'m disabling the buttons when at the min and max respectively.
2017-02-07T17:34:19 <Justin_o> but i\'m finding that they look quite like the textfield
2017-02-07T17:34:30 <Justin_o> which may lead a user to think that the textfield is disabled
2017-02-07T17:35:12 <danayo> let me take a look Justin_o
2017-02-07T17:36:06 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2017-02-07T17:38:55 <danayo> can you show me what you\'ve got now Justin_o?
2017-02-07T17:39:04 <danayo> maybe a screenshot?
2017-02-07T17:41:21 <Justin_o> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xjTLgShC/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-07%20at%2012.40.58%20PM.png
2017-02-07T17:42:18 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2017-02-07T17:44:07 <Justin_o> danayo: np, the one on the left is disabled, the one on the right is enabled.
2017-02-07T17:44:17 <danayo> yes
2017-02-07T17:45:28 <Justin_o> danayo: i had tried to style the textfield more like the designs, which is when i noticed the problem.. Although the number in the textfield is not greyed out, the greyboard matches the colour of the disabled button
2017-02-07T17:46:48 <danayo> Justin_o: I suppose we could make the texfield border darker, closer to black
2017-02-07T17:47:21 <danayo> we\'ll need a different solution for high-contrast themes tho (I\'ll take a look at this)
2017-02-07T17:48:13 <danayo> Justin_o: looking at the screenshot though, I think because the text is dark, it\'s not so bad
2017-02-07T17:48:17 <Justin_o> danayo: if we make the border darker, do you think it\'ll look too much like the button?
2017-02-07T17:48:33 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, that\'s true
2017-02-07T17:48:39 <danayo> I think if we keep it with sharp corners, and thinner border, it\'ll be ok
2017-02-07T17:48:47 <danayo> (won\'t look like the button)
2017-02-07T17:48:53 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, so as is in the screenshot should be fine?
2017-02-07T17:49:08 <Justin_o> danayo: or you\'d like the darker border too?
2017-02-07T17:49:52 <danayo> I think it\'s ok as-is Justin_o, because the text is dark, and also because there\'s no state change (it always looks the same), whereas the buttons change when disabled
2017-02-07T17:50:13 <danayo> disabled/enabled
2017-02-07T17:50:13 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, cool thanks.
2017-02-07T17:50:18 <danayo> thank you Justin_o
2017-02-07T17:51:13 <Justin_o> danayo: please let me know what you\'d like for them in contrast mode. I think the default styling is just about done.

2017-02-07T18:01:32 <danayo> Jess_, Justin_o: do either of you recall, by any chance, where stored/linked to that PGA interactive FD tool prototype for the senior\'s intake centre? It was an interactive PDF. I know we accessed it during the workshop in DC - can\'t find it anywhere (only the InDesign source file).
2017-02-07T18:02:11 <Jess_> woah, blast from the past\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-02-07T18:02:14 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'m not sure, i would have guess the wiki page
2017-02-07T18:02:28 <danayo> yeah ... i checked the wiki
2017-02-07T18:02:49 <danayo> thanks
2017-02-07T18:03:06 <Justin_o> sorry, not sure then.

2017-02-07T18:44:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m running into an issue where i\'m getting values like 1.2000000000000002 instead of 1.2
2017-02-07T18:44:16 <Justin_o> i remember we had a function to take care of that, could you remind me what that\'s called.
2017-02-07T18:45:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m still trying to figure out where the issue is coming from as well.. could be from the stringToNumber transformation
2017-02-07T18:45:43 <Justin_o> sorry, this was supposed to be in fluid-work
2017-02-07T18:46:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it comes from the IEEE-754 standard for floating point numbers :)
2017-02-07T18:47:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) yes, i mean i wonder which part of the code is triggering that quirk
2017-02-07T18:47:28 <Bosmon> Well, hopefully all of it
2017-02-07T18:47:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how should i go about addressing it
2017-02-07T18:47:53 <Bosmon> Given "1.2000000000000002" *is* the correct representative for the number we call "1.2" in that standard
2017-02-07T18:47:54 <Justin_o> as it\'s messing up my model ;(
2017-02-07T18:48:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how is it messed up?
2017-02-07T18:48:41 <Justin_o> bosmon: well.. to a user it seems strange to see 1.2 displayed as 1.2000000000000002 in the UI
2017-02-07T18:50:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I was expecting to find some transforms in alanharn_ \'s chartAuthoring to deal with this, but perhaps there aren\'t
2017-02-07T18:50:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m sure we\'ve run into this before but can\'t remember where
2017-02-07T18:51:02 <Bosmon> A numberToString that rounds to a specified number of decimal places would certainly be a rather essential thing to have
2017-02-07T18:51:06 <Bosmon> But maybe we don\'t have one
2017-02-07T18:51:17 * Caren1 has quit
2017-02-07T18:51:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it would even be a useful option for the existing transform i\'d think
2017-02-07T18:51:37 <Bosmon> Yes, it would
2017-02-07T18:51:59 <Bosmon> Feel free to produce JIRA + PR for one if there doesn\'t already seem to be one around
2017-02-07T18:52:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: will do, thanks
2017-02-07T18:52:11 <Bosmon> Perhaps you could throw a sponge at alanharn_ \'s desk to see if he has one
2017-02-07T18:52:29 <Justin_o> i\'m working from home today, so that\'ll be a difficult throw
2017-02-07T18:52:34 <Bosmon> hahaha
