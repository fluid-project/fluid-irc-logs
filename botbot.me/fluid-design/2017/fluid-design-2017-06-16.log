2017-06-16T13:23:11 <Caren> morning jhung, Justin_o: Can we chat Skate Park? I revisited pedagogy in relation to  text descriptors of a completed track this morning.
2017-06-16T13:24:46 <Justin_o> Caren: sure, i should be able to make some time for that
2017-06-16T13:27:19 <Caren> Here\xe2\x80\x99s a thought that perhaps structures what we were discussing yesterday: in order to learn to make informed predictions (predictions of outcome) I was thinking that text descriptions of the track need to relay info for a mental model that can then be used in predictions. (friction and skater descriptions are separate and are the active elements that change the prediction).
2017-06-16T13:28:07 <Caren> So the question would be what are the key descriptors? height, angles, lengths, shapes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about what will affect energy output...
2017-06-16T13:32:51 <Caren> Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s not super clear. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming back to the idea of visual clues in graphic representation. When interacting with a visual graphic there is usually a first layer of visual clues that orient the person engaging with \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d.
2017-06-16T13:33:46 <jhung> Caren: That\'s a great point. Mathematically speaking, we\'d talk about slope (rise over run mathematically). This will give an idea of how "steep" something is.
2017-06-16T13:34:51 <jhung> I\'m thinking of an algorithm\xe2\x80\xa6 if we took each length of continuous track, chopped it up into say 20 pieces. Each of those pieces we would calculate the slope. We can then get a fairly good idea of what the track looks like.
2017-06-16T13:35:43 <jhung> The key to being able to generate such descriptions (and to do the math / interpretation behind it), is to figure out how PhET has represented the track in the sim itself.
2017-06-16T13:36:27 <Caren> jhung: is that something to discuss today at 11, do you think?
2017-06-16T13:36:40 <jhung> I\'m going to shoot jesse and michael an email now to see if they can investigate before the meeting.
2017-06-16T13:36:51 <Caren> awesome.

2017-06-16T14:14:20 <Caren> jhung: I wonder if what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about re track description connects at all with the paper Tali sent us about TAIG? It says TAIG constructs a coherently organized initial summary of a graphic (bar charts for now but envisioned to cover other graphics).

2017-06-16T14:16:39 <jhung> I haven\'t looked closely to that yet Caren. There could be some ideas there.

2017-06-16T16:49:45 <jhung> fluid-everyone: updated John Travoltage in development includes keyboard accessibility, and new sonifications from GaTech (reset sound). http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/wrapper/phet-io-wrapper-sonification/1.0.0-dev.7/phet-io-wrapper-sonification/john-travoltage/html/john-travoltage-sonification.html
2017-06-16T16:49:59 <jhung> ^jess might be worth bookmarking that for your demos. :)
2017-06-16T16:50:31 <Jess__> ;) thanks jhung !
2017-06-16T16:53:49 <colinclark> jhung: Did the Georgia Tech team add the sort of 8-bit aesthetic to the movement of the arm?
2017-06-16T16:54:06 <colinclark> with notes ascending as you get closer to the doorknob?
2017-06-16T16:55:47 <jhung> colinclark: That was there before w the early work we did with John Blanco.
2017-06-16T16:56:08 <jhung> Although it sounds a bit better now. So maybe there were some modifications.
2017-06-16T16:56:28 <colinclark> ah, ok
2017-06-16T17:02:14 * danayo joined the channel
2017-06-16T17:02:39 <danayo> thanks jhung. it\'s great. i like the reset sound. i noticed that you don\'t get the scuffing sound when you use the keyboard to move the foot. is that intentional?
2017-06-16T17:03:24 <jhung> not all the sounds are there danayo. But there was a scuffing sound in one of the earlier prototypes.
2017-06-16T17:03:47 <danayo> i hear it when I use the mouse jhung, just not the keyboard
2017-06-16T17:04:06 <jhung> danayo: Oh interesting! Good catch. I\'ll mention that to John B.

2017-06-16T20:23:51 <michelled> cool :)
2017-06-16T20:24:09 <michelled> is it true that you and Joseph worked through JT\'s feedback on the risk and security assessment for OPC?
2017-06-16T20:24:15 <michelled> I\'m just sending her a quick update email

2017-06-16T20:24:24 <michelled> since she said it\'s keeping her up at night
2017-06-16T20:24:54 <danayo> yes, it\'s true, let me just double check that we responded to all of her comments
2017-06-16T20:25:41 <michelled> thx
2017-06-16T20:31:42 <danayo> michelled: yes, we did work through all of jutta\'s feedback.
2017-06-16T20:32:06 <michelled> thanks!
2017-06-16T20:32:08 <danayo> np
2017-06-16T20:32:54 <danayo> michelled: happy to help getting jutta more sleep :)
