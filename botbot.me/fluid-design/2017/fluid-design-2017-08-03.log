2017-08-03T13:48:10 <jhung> Justin_o - Hugh McGuire (on Slack) is asking how one would go about making an adjuster to change the width of a container (i.e.a fixed width selector). Would you be open to hanging out on Slack periodically to give them pointers?

2017-08-03T17:57:36 <Caren> jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99m reviewing the PhET doc that Emily shared with us last week: Keyboard Nav-sorted by sim
2017-08-03T17:58:36 <Caren> wanted to orient our next steps and get to know the sim we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on
2017-08-03T17:59:32 <Caren> I see that MB is in progress on Ohm\xe2\x80\x99s Law and Resistance in a Wire

2017-08-03T18:00:35 <Caren> jhung: sorry, I should have said HELLO first :-)
2017-08-03T18:02:21 <jhung> Caren: For now we should focus on wrapping up the threads on Energy Skate Park. So this means making sure everything is on the Wiki etc. Once that\'s done I think we can then move onto Faraday\'s Law which will likely be the next sim.
2017-08-03T18:03:24 <jhung> I\'ve added tasks in the Iteration Plan page under PhET Caren. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2017-08-03T18:06:35 * simonjb has quit
2017-08-03T18:09:19 <Caren> Forgot we agreed on Faraday\xe2\x80\x99s law. sorry about that. I checked the wiki earlier\xe2\x80\xa6I belive all my contributions are on there.
2017-08-03T18:21:37 <jhung> Caren: Do you still have content in Google docs? If so, can we make sure they are duplicated onto the wiki. Those google docs should be "locked down" so that any future work happens on the Wiki.
2017-08-03T18:22:44 <Caren> jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at my discovery doc that is in a google doc. Will make a page for it in the wiki.
2017-08-03T18:23:14 <jhung> Thanks Caren!

2017-08-03T18:50:54 <Jess_> lliskovoi: did you ever check out grackle?
2017-08-03T18:58:21 <lliskovoi> Jess_: sounds familiar, I think had a quick look
2017-08-03T19:10:36 <Jess_> dying to know what you thought lliskovoi
2017-08-03T19:24:23 <lliskovoi> Jess_: looks interesting, but it seems like the focus is on accessible export rather than interacting the document within Google Docs. I need to figure out how to use a screen reader within Google Docs, looks it has it\'s own keyboard navigation shortcuts so I\'ll need to look into it
2017-08-03T19:24:41 <Jess_> ah
