2017-10-06T18:47:47 <sepidehshahi> colinclark, gmoss danayo and alanharnum, you may have already seen this tool. The option they have for highlighting and commenting on some parts of stories seemed interesting: https://about.medium.com/
2017-10-06T18:54:52 <gmoss> sepidehshahi: I've certainly heard of Medium and have read many an article published on it, but I don't have any experience using it
2017-10-06T18:57:47 <gmoss> I think my friend's old job might have had a hand in designing it back in the day? I could be remembering things incorrectly
2017-10-06T18:59:19 <gmoss> https://www.teehanlax.com/story/medium/
2017-10-06T19:00:59 <sepidehshahi> cool! I have not used it either gmoss. I just tried to play with the editor and seemed very easy to use
2017-10-06T19:05:14 <gmoss> sepidehshahi: according to Wikipedia, they use an editor based on TinyMCE
2017-10-06T19:05:43 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-10-06T19:07:25 <gmoss> I've just tried to use the editor at https://www.tinymce.com/ with NVDA, it seems decently usable with the keyboard and the descriptions are helpful
