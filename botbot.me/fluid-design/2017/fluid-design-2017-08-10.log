2017-08-10T16:43:11 <Caren> colinclark: ping!
2017-08-10T16:44:07 <colinclark> hiya Caren
2017-08-10T16:44:11 <colinclark> what's up
2017-08-10T16:44:59 <Caren> Is it possible to take the Inclusive Design Guide template (with the tabs) and create a Platform Cooperativism Guide\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-08-10T16:45:13 <Caren> Jutta and I were talking
2017-08-10T16:45:33 <Caren> and it seems to be info that nees to be accessed
2017-08-10T16:45:43 <Caren> by other potential projects
2017-08-10T16:46:51 <Caren> I suspect that may be a fairly big endeavour
2017-08-10T16:51:31 <danayo> i think jhung may have some thoughts on this^ ?
2017-08-10T16:53:17 <jhung> danayo Caren colinclark - give me a minute. In a meeting.
2017-08-10T16:59:44 <colinclark> Caren: Yep, jhung is probably the best person to answer that question
2017-08-10T17:00:01 <colinclark> but I expect it will take some technical time and effort
2017-08-10T17:01:36 <jhung> Caren: yes. It's possible. But there's also an outstanding piece of work which fixes navigation and some issues with mobile. That needs to get finished at some point, but one could theoretically use the template that's already there in github.
2017-08-10T17:02:05 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2017-08-10T17:02:12 <jhung> I'd feel better if that outstanding work was merged first before any new sites are built from it.
2017-08-10T17:02:44 * avtar has quit
2017-08-10T17:02:59 <jhung> Also, what kind of functionality is required? Maybe let's start there and we can figure out what is needed Caren.
2017-08-10T17:03:52 <Caren> That\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, jhung.
2017-08-10T17:04:59 <Caren> Let me get a bit more a brief together in the next day or two and circle back around if that\xe2\x80\x99s ok?
2017-08-10T17:05:28 * gtirloni has quit
2017-08-10T17:06:40 <Caren> thanks, jhung colinclark danayo
2017-08-10T17:07:05 <jhung> Caren: that'd be excellent. Thanks!

2017-08-10T17:57:15 <jhung> I see danayo is not here, but anyone know if she might have something?
2017-08-10T18:00:17 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-08-10T18:03:03 <Justin_o> jhung: don't know about dana, i don't have anything yet, unless something comes up for UIO+ or maybe self voicing, but nothing yet

2017-08-10T18:30:03 <jhung> ok Justin_o. M-avtar and I may want to talk about the UIO video(s).
2017-08-10T18:30:23 <Justin_o> jhung: would you like me to join, and when are you talking?
2017-08-10T18:30:43 <jhung> ^Justin_o sorry I meant for next week's design crit.
2017-08-10T18:31:04 <Justin_o> jhung: ah right, i think i saw an e-mail about that

2017-08-10T19:05:38 <alanharnum> neat interactive simulation demonstrating how large collective biases can emerge from small individual biases: http://ncase.me/polygons/
2017-08-10T19:05:40 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-08-10T19:06:08 <alanharnum> the use of the polygon-people reminds me of the illustrations the co-op students did

2017-08-10T20:57:45 <Caren> really neat, alanharnum. I love the little green pentagon at the end.
2017-08-10T20:59:25 * danayo has quit
2017-08-10T21:00:16 <alanharnum> Caren: yeah, their other work is really neat as well - I really dig this game theory one: http://ncase.me/trust/
2017-08-10T21:00:20 * danayo joined the channel
2017-08-10T21:06:16 <Caren> ah, very very cool alanharnum.
2017-08-10T21:06:26 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m looking into their sites a little more, too
2017-08-10T21:17:24 <danayo> cool game alanharnum
2017-08-10T21:29:21 <simonjb> alanharnum: the polygons simulation is really cool
2017-08-10T21:30:02 <alanharnum> yeah, I'm familiar with the Schelling theory, but it's really well-presented here
2017-08-10T21:31:05 <alanharnum> reminds me of Conway's Game of Life, but a bit more interesting to watch; I suppose they're both cellular automatons
2017-08-10T21:32:26 <simonjb> yeah, it's super-well presented and builds up nicely, gradually introducing different rules into the simulation
