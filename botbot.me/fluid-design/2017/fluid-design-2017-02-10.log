b"2017-02-10T19:54:05 <Caren> TESTING. I\xe2\x80\x99ve loaded a new IRC client. If you can, let me know if you read this in the channel. thanks. Have a lovely weekend.
2017-02-10T19:57:22 <Jess__> Caren: i see you!
2017-02-10T19:57:44 <danayo> CAREN
2017-02-10T19:57:50 <Caren> yay! thanks Jess_
2017-02-10T19:58:13 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-02-10T19:58:31 <Caren> and you all have your names attached to your comments. Bliss. Danayo!
2017-02-10T19:58:42 <danayo> woohoo

2017-02-10T20:33:17 <Jess__> hey lliskovoi the web client looked almost exactly the same as it ever did \xe2\x80\x94 same as your review \xe2\x80\x94 no chat, limited functionality, etc.
2017-02-10T20:33:34 <lliskovoi> oh ok Jess__ good to know
2017-02-10T20:33:52 <lliskovoi> strange that he didn't know that
2017-02-10T20:38:10 <Jess__> lliskovoi: maybe i did something weird, dunno

2017-02-10T20:41:26 <colinclark> After the call, I just got pushed a new version of Neo
2017-02-10T20:41:54 <colinclark> Do we know what the value of Neo is, specifically, Jess__?
2017-02-10T20:41:59 <Jess__> colinclark: what is the version?
2017-02-10T20:42:04 <colinclark> yup, a new version
2017-02-10T20:42:16 <colinclark> My impression is that they're eventually going to sunset the old client that we currently use and everyone is going to use Neo
2017-02-10T20:42:29 <colinclark> I may be mistaken
2017-02-10T20:42:35 <colinclark> so it seems to me that a barter is less predicated on getting access to Neo
2017-02-10T20:42:39 <colinclark> since we already do :)
2017-02-10T20:42:46 <Jess__> colinclark: can you share the number of the new client? my neo always says restart to get a new version but i don\xe2\x80\x99t actually get one
2017-02-10T20:42:49 <colinclark> and rather, to their commitment to produce a version of Neo that's accessible
2017-02-10T20:43:02 <colinclark> It now says 4.2.1216
2017-02-10T20:43:10 <colinclark> and I was on a 4.1.x build during the call
2017-02-10T20:44:05 <colinclark> this build does work nicely with our portal, too
2017-02-10T20:44:32 <Jess__> colinclark: as i said in the call, i think we can kick up a conversation with Nic about how they might support us upgrading beyond sf\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s at least worth a try and yes, the goal is to have an accessible neo
2017-02-10T20:45:09 <colinclark> great
2017-02-10T20:46:35 <Jess__> wednesday this week the client was 1205
2017-02-10T20:46:45 <Jess__> 4.2.1.1205 that is
2017-02-10T20:46:47 <colinclark> ah
2017-02-10T20:47:43 <Jess__> gtirloni gave me their portal url earlier this week to get the latest GA (i think) candidate
2017-02-10T20:47:46 <Jess__> but i can\xe2\x80\x99t find it now
2017-02-10T20:47:55 <colinclark> oh great

2017-02-10T15:29:41 <Caren> Hi michelled and colinclark
2017-02-10T15:29:48 <colinclark> CAREN!
2017-02-10T15:29:49 <michelled> hey Caren
2017-02-10T15:30:12 <Caren> meet me and danayo on vidyo at 11est?
2017-02-10T15:30:21 <michelled> perfect!
2017-02-10T15:30:21 <colinclark> sure, that works
2017-02-10T15:30:38 <Caren> awesome. see you soon
2017-02-10T15:31:34 <danayo> thanks Caren
2017-02-10T15:39:50 * simonjb has quit
2017-02-10T15:44:46 <mrtyler> i think this article fits into this channel: http://civichall.org/civicist/an-education-in-community-technology/
2017-02-10T15:45:04 <mrtyler> What would you have done differently from the beginning, knowing what you know now?
2017-02-10T15:45:07 <mrtyler> I would have immediately built jobs programs for regular people in technology. Things like Smart Health Centers and Youth-Led Tech. I never would have created programs that focused on high-tech solutions built by high-tech people.
2017-02-10T15:53:48 <michelled> danayo: look at this map of Canada! http://guxiong.ca/en/group-exhibitions/invisible-in-the-light-4/
2017-02-10T15:55:51 <danayo> omg those are tomatoes michelled?
2017-02-10T15:57:15 <danayo> thanks mrtyler
2017-02-10T15:58:11 <michelled> they are :)
2017-02-10T15:58:33 <gloob> we call that tomates plum tomatoes, although straight translation is "pear tomatoes"
2017-02-10T15:58:44 <danayo> mrtyler: I especially like this idea: By \xe2\x80\x9cmeeting\xe2\x80\x9d I mean any place where regular residents gather to talk about our shared lives. In almost all instances, there are parts of those meetings that relate to technical needs. The problem is that when we invite people to civic tech meetings, we are necessarily leading with our framework (\xe2\x80\x9cwe love civic tech and we think we can use it to solve your problems!\xe2\x80\x9d) rather than simply being
2017-02-10T15:58:45 <danayo> present with them.
2017-02-10T15:59:04 <mrtyler> danayo: yeah i thought that was pretty insightful
2017-02-10T15:59:14 <mrtyler> disclaimer: i don\'t have any real experience in community building :)
2017-02-10T15:59:53 <michelled> what a great quote!
2017-02-10T16:00:02 <danayo> yes!
2017-02-10T16:00:14 <danayo> seems like a good place to start, mrtyler :)
2017-02-10T16:00:21 <mrtyler> hehe :)
2017-02-10T16:00:35 <danayo> gloob, michelled: i could not figure out the scale at first at all, I thought maybe they were goji berries!!
2017-02-10T16:00:53 <michelled> yes, it\'s difficult to tell
2017-02-10T16:00:56 <gloob> mrtyler: I had a similar discussion with JJ last weekend
2017-02-10T16:00:59 <mrtyler> i also thought this was interesting: "The dominant social movements of the last five years have next to nothing to do with civic tech. Black Lives Matter, the rise of racist Trumpian political ideas, marriage equity\xe2\x80\x94they owe nothing to civic tech.
2017-02-10T16:01:03 <mrtyler> "
2017-02-10T16:01:22 <mrtyler> that kind of leaves out the Arab Spring
2017-02-10T16:01:26 <gloob> mrtyler: technology is going (or just turned) in a basic subject for any job
2017-02-10T16:01:28 <mrtyler> but i guess that was still just twitter
2017-02-10T16:01:36 <mrtyler> (+ clever WAN tech :))
2017-02-10T16:02:02 <gloob> aligned with the "not high tech but widespread technology"
2017-02-10T16:02:13 <michelled> Caren: whose room?
2017-02-10T16:02:38 <mrtyler> gloob: i agree. the bar has been lowering for at least three decades
2017-02-10T16:02:50 <mrtyler> on how much technology a person needs to really succeed in modern civilization
2017-02-10T16:02:56 <gloob> mrtyler: not only the bar but the need to know to be efficient or profitable
2017-02-10T16:02:59 <Caren> come to my room
2017-02-10T16:03:00 <gloob> exactly
2017-02-10T16:03:24 <mrtyler> altho otoh, within 5 minutes of meeting him my neighbor told me that he doesn\'t own a computer
2017-02-10T16:03:31 <mrtyler> "i can buy a lot of stamps for the cost of a computer."
2017-02-10T16:03:42 <mrtyler> :)
2017-02-10T16:03:45 <gloob> mrtyler: own a mobile phone?
2017-02-10T16:04:09 <gloob> a current mobile phone is faster, techy as any desktop pc of 3 years ago
2017-02-10T16:04:10 <mrtyler> idk, but if he does i bet you a donut it\'s a flip-phone
2017-02-10T16:04:24 <mrtyler> maybe 5 years ago but sure
2017-02-10T16:04:58 <mrtyler> but i guess the point of the article is that these ideas are not compelling to people who aren\'t already drinking the technology kool-aid
2017-02-10T16:05:01 <gloob> it\'s really difficult to be off the grid
2017-02-10T16:05:15 <mrtyler> so if you want to engage those people, you ahve to set tech aside and focus on their lives and problems
2017-02-10T16:05:27 <gloob> you mean, that are not ready for average people?
2017-02-10T16:05:34 <gloob> ah, of course
2017-02-10T16:05:42 <gloob> the tech as a tool not as the medium or the end
2017-02-10T16:05:47 <mrtyler> yeah
2017-02-10T16:05:57 <mrtyler> tech is only a medium to us nerds
2017-02-10T16:06:03 <gloob> that\'s a problem we have, that we ... yes
2017-02-10T16:06:09 <gloob> nerds loves that details
2017-02-10T16:06:11 <gloob> it is like
2017-02-10T16:06:20 <gloob> go with your wife to watch star wars
2017-02-10T16:06:36 <gloob> I sell her as a romantic familiar drama
2017-02-10T16:06:39 <gloob> and it works in that way
2017-02-10T16:06:51 <gloob> if I explained in other nerdy terms, probably we won\'t go
2017-02-10T16:07:06 <gloob> I think the same apply here
2017-02-10T16:07:15 <mrtyler> sure
2017-02-10T16:07:28 <mrtyler> lucas succeeded not because of the special effects or the spacefaring setting
2017-02-10T16:07:41 <mrtyler> he succeeded because he borrowed tropes as identified by joseph campbell
2017-02-10T16:07:49 <mrtyler> archetypes and the collective unconscious and all that jungian stuff :)
2017-02-10T16:08:07 <gloob> romantic familiar drama
2017-02-10T16:08:08 <mrtyler> like the romantic aspect you used to sell your wife on the film
2017-02-10T16:08:11 <mrtyler> right
2017-02-10T16:08:39 <gloob> stories are stories
2017-02-10T16:08:54 <gloob> tools are tools
2017-02-10T16:08:59 <gloob> my reflexion of today
2017-02-10T16:09:00 <gloob> xD
2017-02-10T16:09:14 <gloob> or reflections
2017-02-10T16:09:16 <gloob> whatever
2017-02-10T16:09:20 <gloob> false friends here, maybe
2017-02-10T16:09:51 <mrtyler> the x form, "reflexion" is considered archaic i think :)
2017-02-10T16:09:55 <gloob> my reflection
2017-02-10T16:10:18 <gloob> it came from latin root, in spanish is "reflexi\xc3\xb3n"
2017-02-10T16:10:32 <mrtyler> i would have expected "refleccion"
2017-02-10T16:10:57 <mrtyler> don\'t think i\'ve ever encountered that -xion ending
