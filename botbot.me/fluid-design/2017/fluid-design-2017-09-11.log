2017-09-11T14:43:34 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo and jhung, I am downloading CC apps and I noticed Xd CC. From their demo, it seems very interesting. it provides the options for designing and prototyping wireframes at the same time. I was wondering if you had used it or if you know more about it. thanks
2017-09-11T14:44:25 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I haven\'t used it, but I think danayo had used it for a prototype before.
2017-09-11T14:45:05 <jhung> The downside is that the prototypes are not accessible. So it\'s very much targeted to sighted users with mouse / gesture input.
2017-09-11T14:45:24 <danayo> yes, what he said! :)
2017-09-11T14:45:38 <danayo> Caren and I used it to prototype the Privacy tool
2017-09-11T14:45:54 <danayo> I\'ll send you a link to the file sepidehshahi
2017-09-11T14:46:39 <danayo> it\'s really easy to use but as jhung said, the prototypes are not accessible, which is a real bummer
2017-09-11T14:47:08 <sepidehshahi> jhung: yes, most prototyping tools are like that. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found any yet that is accessible
2017-09-11T14:47:18 <danayo> I think alanharnum and I talked about whether or not we could hack the output file, but no luck
2017-09-11T14:49:08 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo - an alternative is to use an approach similar to what we did for PhET. Create prototypes in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The initial time commitment is higher, but it pays off in the long run.
2017-09-11T14:49:40 <jhung> It was so valuable to get input from AT users in that scenario.
2017-09-11T14:51:23 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s true. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that initial commitment and being proficient in CSS and HTML that makes it difficult
2017-09-11T14:52:35 <jhung> sepidehshahi very true. CSS frameworks can help with the CSS aspect, but there still needs to be some proficiency with HTML and Javascript.
2017-09-11T14:53:33 <danayo> sepidehshahi: here is the prototype we created. I think it\'s the latest - unfortunately Xd is telling me I need to update in order to open the file, but then it\'s not letting me update/install :(
2017-09-11T14:53:35 <danayo> https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/QB9XgmBwpulaH20
2017-09-11T14:54:46 <sepidehshahi> danayo: thanks, this is great!
2017-09-11T14:55:27 <sepidehshahi> actually it is very easy to play the prototype. I really wish there was a way to hack it and make it accessible\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-09-11T14:57:13 <sepidehshahi> danayo: M-avtar sent me this link: https://www.adobe.com/ca/creativecloud/catalog/desktop.html so you can log in with your OCADU user name and no password required and then it redirects you to OCAD page and you can update your CC apps
2017-09-11T14:57:23 <danayo> I KNOW IT! it\'s really such a shame sepidehshahi
2017-09-11T14:57:43 <danayo> it\'s such a great tool otherwise
2017-09-11T14:58:15 <danayo> thatnks for the link sepidehshahi - I think it was some kind of delay - I just got prompted for a password to update
2017-09-11T14:58:28 <sepidehshahi> awesome!

2017-09-11T15:57:42 <sepidehshahi> Hi Justin_o, if you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any topic for the community meeting and still wanted to have the meeting, can we talk about learning differences and how it could be used for ILDH or Design guides?
2017-09-11T16:02:18 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks, i\'ll pencil that in, would you mind to lead it?
2017-09-11T16:03:27 <sepidehshahi> sure Justin_o . it will be more like a design crit.
2017-09-11T16:03:34 <Justin_o> sure no problem

2017-09-11T17:05:43 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: ah good point
2017-09-11T17:06:24 <sepidehshahi> she is in the office Justin_o, so I can check if she is available on Wednesday
2017-09-11T17:11:33 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: she is not available this Wednesday. But following Wednesdays may work for her.

2017-09-11T19:31:55 <gmoss> danayo, alanharnum: i\'m currently reviewing the latest wireframes for the storytelling tool, as well as the questions from last time, and whipping up some new questions (in case we have time to address them tomorrow morning).  Is there anything that either of you think would be good to cover tomorrow, considering the SJRK partners have been invited to the crit?
2017-09-11T19:32:53 <gmoss> I plan to update the Wiki page with these questions (https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28SJRK%29+Digital+Storytelling+Tool+Design)
2017-09-11T19:33:09 <danayo> Thanks gmoss, I\'ll take a look at those questions. I was thinking to walk through the changes I made to the mockups since our last crit (and based on the feedback we got there)
2017-09-11T19:33:12 <gmoss> *these = the ones I\'m currently compiling in my note-taking app :)
2017-09-11T19:33:25 <danayo> cool
2017-09-11T19:33:39 <danayo> I\'ll wait then :)
2017-09-11T19:35:34 <gmoss> danayo: Okay, yes that sounds like an excellent plan! we haven\'t adjusted the UI to line it up with your most recent wireframe, yet, but it\'s very similar as it currently stands. I think it would be quite valuable to review the latest. I expect James will be interested to see the translation flow, since iirc his feedback kickstarted that whole feature
2017-09-11T19:35:56 <gmoss> I\'ll let you know when the wiki has been updated with my \'new\' questions
2017-09-11T19:35:58 <danayo> for sure gmoss
2017-09-11T19:36:00 <danayo> great

2017-09-11T20:17:10 <danayo> hi alanharnum: anything specific you think we should address at the partners meeting tomorrow? for those who can\'t make the crit I figure we can provide a summary of the discussion. anything else?
2017-09-11T20:17:42 <danayo> and gmoss, colinclark ^
2017-09-11T20:17:44 <alanharnum> danayo: can\'t think of anything. will check in on DEEP and budgets with whoever\'s present.
2017-09-11T20:18:00 <danayo> ok great
2017-09-11T20:18:43 <colinclark> seems like a good plan :)
2017-09-11T20:20:35 <gmoss> danayo yeah I think a summary of the crit is a good idea, and perhaps any discussion that can be had at this point wrt the in-person partners meeting in October (hopefully I haven\'t conflated that with something else, and it\'s actually happening :))
2017-09-11T20:21:50 <danayo> yes it\'s happening gmoss! we haven\'t thought through the details yet though - I guess we have 2 more partners meetings before then, but we should definitely start planning soon
2017-09-11T20:35:33 <danayo> alanharnum: could you remind me of the room number for the collab room? Liam will be coming over in person for the crit tomorrow so if you could keep an eye out for him that would be great - I\'m going to attempt to explain to him how to find the room :)
2017-09-11T21:01:41 * clown has quit
2017-09-11T21:07:58 <alanharnum> danayo: Collab room is 219, IDRC office where I sit is 201 - I\'ll try and remember to leave the door open tomorrow, but otherwise he can just knock on it :)
2017-09-11T21:36:41 <gmoss> danayo: I\'ve updated the list of design questions, namely the "Translations" item and below: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28SJRK%29+Digital+Storytelling+Tool+Design
2017-09-11T21:36:48 <gmoss> I may have over-analyzed some of it :)
