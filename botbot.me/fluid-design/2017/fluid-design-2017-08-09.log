2017-08-09T12:55:54 <grrrero> jhung, Justin_o and danayo: I have some documentation up here for web icon fonts --> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Standard+workflow+in+maintaining+and+creating+icon+fonts
2017-08-09T12:56:06 <grrrero> Let me know what you think?
2017-08-09T12:56:49 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks, i'll take a look

2017-08-09T13:17:58 <Justin_o> grrrero: read over your icon font docs. I made a couple changes to fix typos. It looks good, but I think a couple of additions would be 1) add a link to the master .ai file. Also I'm thinking that this shouldn't be a requirement for others to contribute SVGs to the repo, provided that they meet some criteria. So it may be useful to explain what that criteria is, and mention that you can work from this master .ai
2017-08-09T13:17:58 <Justin_o> file to  meet that criteria. 2) can you add comments to the icons configuration in the Gruntfile.js file. In particular for the parts that shouldn't be modified, which I would assume fontHeight, ascent, and descent would fall under.
2017-08-09T13:20:01 <grrrero> Justin_o: Ok, will do, thanks!

2017-08-09T17:24:10 <Caren> shall we house it somewhere on the wiki?
2017-08-09T17:25:53 <Caren> there is also a co-op \xe2\x80\x9cmap\xe2\x80\x9d that we may want on the wiki, too\xe2\x80\xa6? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/f/28001

2017-08-09T18:09:44 <Caren> Hi michelled. Sorry, I missed your Q from earlier and then responded when you were offline. Here they are again:
2017-08-09T18:09:47 <Caren> Caren: Hi michelled: no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the wiki but on owncloud: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/f/27533
2017-08-09T18:09:48 <Caren> [1:24pm] Caren: shall we house it somewhere on the wiki?

2017-08-09T18:10:47 <michelled> Caren: I like the idea of putting them on the wiki
2017-08-09T18:11:11 <Caren> Sure, michelled.
2017-08-09T18:11:25 <michelled> thanks!
2017-08-09T18:13:49 <Caren> michelle: do you think the graphics should be a new project (Platform Co-op) or under an existing project?
2017-08-09T18:14:02 <Caren> ^michelled
2017-08-09T18:33:51 <michelled> a new project, Caren
2017-08-09T18:33:58 <michelled> since there's a good chance it one day will be :)

2017-08-09T20:21:22 <jhung> michelled: not really. You sort of follow the template that's already there.
2017-08-09T20:21:38 <jhung> the readme.md should be updated to include that info.
2017-08-09T20:22:28 <michelled> danayo: does that help? or do you need a bit more info?
2017-08-09T20:22:59 <michelled> danayo: simonjb did it last month, so it's probably fresh in his mind
2017-08-09T20:23:37 * Caren joined the channel
2017-08-09T20:24:54 <danayo> thanks jhung, could you link me to the template?
2017-08-09T20:25:10 <simonjb> danayo: you'll need to make a change to the https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org project
2017-08-09T20:25:26 <simonjb> and then submit a pull request with your changes
2017-08-09T20:25:54 <danayo> thanks simonjb
2017-08-09T20:26:04 <simonjb> here is the pull request for my recent news addition: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/57/files
2017-08-09T20:26:19 <jhung> danayo: there's no template per se, you just follow the pattern using what the previous news items have done.
2017-08-09T20:26:28 <simonjb> danayo: you can see there which files I changed and where
2017-08-09T20:26:40 <danayo> ok great jhung simonjb
