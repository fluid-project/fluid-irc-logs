b"2017-11-22T21:56:16 <alanharnum> secondly (and this is a somewhat power user UX perspective, though I think it's become less so as tabs have become the predominant mode of browsing), a browser user always has the option to open a link in a new window or tab via a shift-click, control-click or right-button context menu
2017-11-22T21:56:53 <alanharnum> force-opening new windows or tabs takes power away from the user
2017-11-22T21:56:56 <alanharnum> IMO
2017-11-22T21:57:02 <grrrero> Right
2017-11-22T21:57:17 <alanharnum> that said, I recognize a range of opinion on this topic, which we clearly have within the IDRC based on how the ILDH is set up
2017-11-22T21:57:38 <grrrero> Let's consult with lliskovoi tomorrow?
2017-11-22T21:58:50 <danayo> thanks alanharnum, based on that I\xe2\x80\x99d move to open new pages in same tab, but happy to hear what lliskovoi and others have to say
2017-11-22T21:59:13 <alanharnum> it might be worth sending an email to the fluid-work list - I obviously don't know the whole history of the design choices behind the ILDH and other places we do open new windows
2017-11-22T21:59:25 <alanharnum> and we do follow the technique advise of indicating it will open in a new window
2017-11-22T22:00:51 <alanharnum> i also have to dash in 5 minutes to go see Stalker at TIFF so we should definitely continue this tomorrow - want to make sure I hear danayo's perspective
2017-11-22T22:01:21 <grrrero> Ooooh enjoy alanharnum :)
2017-11-22T22:01:41 <alanharnum> on a final unrelated note I was at a book launch last night & met the librettist of this, which may be of interest: http://www.garethwilliamsmusic.com/breath-cycle
2017-11-22T22:02:56 <grrrero> Wow that's awesome
2017-11-22T22:03:28 <alanharnum> it's really interesting - I hadn't known that people with cystic fibrosis literally can't safely be around each other
2017-11-22T22:03:52 <grrrero> My overall knowledge of cystic fibrosis is very limited -- so this is good to know

2017-11-22T15:41:43 <Caren_> hello everyone. Has anyone seen or heard of a voice to text, or audio recording (like Voice Memos) app that either simultaniously or at a pause renders the words into some type of visual representation\xe2\x80\x94something that becomes unique art to the individual speaking?
2017-11-22T15:44:37 <colinclark> Caren_: what an interesting idea!
2017-11-22T15:46:52 * clown_afk is now known as clown
2017-11-22T15:47:21 <gtirloni> indeed. i don\'t know if this would qualify as unique art but it\'s a speech visualizer: https://prezi.com/jrc-i6esvvd1/bellen-portable-speech-visualiser/
2017-11-22T15:47:36 <Caren_> colinclark: I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing that while having different options for output of learning the thing that becomes frustrating for some kids is the creativity that goes along with scribing or drawing with pencil and paper.
2017-11-22T15:48:13 <Caren_> that was a messy and confusing sentence\xe2\x80\xa6let me rephrase
2017-11-22T15:48:24 <colinclark> oh prezi
2017-11-22T15:48:27 <colinclark> this is making me dizzy
2017-11-22T15:49:23 <gtirloni> yeah :( same here
2017-11-22T15:49:49 <gtirloni> but i think that\'s not what Caren is looking for
2017-11-22T15:50:02 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-11-22T15:50:29 <gtirloni> all i can think is capturing microphone data and feeding it into one of those winamp/mediaplayer\'s visualizer.. that might help some kids?
2017-11-22T15:50:52 <Caren_> ah, interesting gtirloni
2017-11-22T15:51:55 <colinclark> what aspect do you imagine visualizing, Caren_?
2017-11-22T15:51:59 <colinclark> the sound of the words?
2017-11-22T15:52:15 <Caren_> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question colinclark
2017-11-22T15:52:19 <colinclark> or the words themselves in some way?
2017-11-22T15:52:50 <Caren_> perhaps both depending on what the user wants to see from their words
2017-11-22T15:53:11 <Caren_> I think of kids who scribe and doodle in the margins
2017-11-22T15:54:31 <Caren_> the creativity, art, beauty is something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen when someone is using voice to text or audio recording for output
2017-11-22T15:54:46 <colinclark> ah, I think I see what you mean, Caren_
2017-11-22T15:54:48 <Caren_> the visual-ness
2017-11-22T15:54:52 <colinclark> yes
2017-11-22T15:55:13 <Caren_> I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing a need for this with the work I\xe2\x80\x99m doing in classroom at the TDSB
2017-11-22T15:55:14 <colinclark> and the kind of surplus "pointlessness"
2017-11-22T15:55:28 <colinclark> doodling happens "alongside" the the process of writing/notetaking
2017-11-22T15:55:34 <colinclark> it\'s part of the process, but different from it
2017-11-22T15:55:40 <Caren_> yes\xe2\x80\xa6the personal expression
2017-11-22T15:57:42 <Caren_> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought this through in much detail. It was a bit of an hmmm what if moment after a school meeting last night.
2017-11-22T16:01:40 * danayo joined the channel
2017-11-22T16:20:54 <Caren_> colinclark and everyone: Been noodling my messy thoughts (sorry for that):  So is it a desire for layers in the \xe2\x80\x9coutput\xe2\x80\x9d that express the individual? For example with voice to text I have seen a strong desire for a unique script like font that represents the users individuality (like handwriting is unique to each person). Words are unique to the individual, but there seems to be a desire for a fuller expression
2017-11-22T16:20:55 <Caren_> individuality.
2017-11-22T16:21:56 <danayo> love that idea Caren_ - audio handwriting
2017-11-22T16:22:41 <Caren_> audio handwriting! awesome danayo
2017-11-22T16:23:06 <alanharnum> Caren_: what a cool idea
2017-11-22T16:24:25 <alanharnum> I can think of some interesting things that could be done by taking the transcription of the live audio recording and looking at things like https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/, or image searches, etc
2017-11-22T16:25:08 <alanharnum> or it could be connected to a library of the recorders own doodling, etc
2017-11-22T16:25:42 <Caren_> oh, that quickdraw is cool alanharnum !
2017-11-22T16:26:03 <alanharnum> yeah, they have their dataset available at https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset
2017-11-22T16:26:52 <alanharnum> so if you imagine something that recognizes a term is available from the Quickdraw set, and sort of draws along with that from the speaking
2017-11-22T16:27:22 <lliskovoi> Caren_: this reminds me of an artists who used to visually live scribe talks at ScienceOnline conferences. Hardly automated, but I think in terms of the output it might be along the lines of what you\'re looking for? http://casw.org/livescribing-perrin-ireland
2017-11-22T16:28:44 <Caren_> thanks lliskovoi that looks very cool. love these
2017-11-22T16:29:26 <alanharnum> the quickdraw data set is interesting because (if I\'m reading this right) it captures both the vectors involved and the time to draw those vectors
2017-11-22T16:30:32 <danayo> gmoss: do you happen to have notes from our partner\'s meeting on nov 7? I can\'t seem to find any
2017-11-22T16:30:33 <alanharnum> it doesn\'t appear that they have an offical API to do something like (FE) pull a random "kangaroo" doodle, which would probably be necessary for what i\'m thinking of
2017-11-22T16:30:43 <gmoss> danayo: I\'ll take a look after standup :)
2017-11-22T16:30:52 <danayo> thanks
2017-11-22T16:31:56 <alanharnum> danayo: I have some notes as well
2017-11-22T16:32:09 <danayo> great alanharnum

2017-11-22T21:53:04 <alanharnum> danayo grrrero: re opening new windows (I see lliskovoi is offline but i\'d like to get opinion on this matter from a WCAG standpoint), I\'ve basically got an a11y opinion and a UX opinion, and they have some crossover
2017-11-22T21:53:59 <alanharnum> the a11y opinion is  based off this technique: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html - note that it\'s a technique, not a guideline. the related guideline is this one: https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20161007/consistent-behavior.html
2017-11-22T21:54:51 <alanharnum> basically, forcing the opening of new windows or tabs "can be disorienting for people, especially people who have difficulty perceiving visual content". also can be disorienting for inexperienced users, people with cognitive issues or memory issues.
2017-11-22T21:55:02 <grrrero> Hmmm I can see that
