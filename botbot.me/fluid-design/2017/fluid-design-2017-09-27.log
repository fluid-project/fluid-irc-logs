2017-09-27T16:10:44 <danayo> sepidehshahi: how about in a 1/2 hour?
2017-09-27T16:10:54 <sepidehshahi> great!
2017-09-27T16:10:57 <danayo> great
2017-09-27T16:14:42 <Caren_> hey everyone, I forgot to mention in standup that I\xe2\x80\x99ve volunteered my time to help some teachers at my son\xe2\x80\x99s school transfer paper-based exercises to digital interactive. Very basic at this point: google docs. My son is aware that he can output independently by scribing, typing, speech to text, audio recording and with a person: speech to scribe, speech to teacher. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about best practices for
2017-09-27T16:14:42 <Caren_> audio recording (telling the listener what they are about to hear, for example), as well as how he is comfortable interacting with digital forms of exercises.
2017-09-27T16:15:44 <Caren_> aslo suggesting that all students get the choice of output, therefore no one is singled out. We\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that when there is a singling out they shut down, and when the digital form is not the same experience as the print form, they feel different and excluded.

2017-09-27T16:52:27 <grrrero> That's not the same as the one used in SJRK tho? danayo

2017-09-27T20:24:12 <gmoss> danayo and alanharnum later on during the community meeting, Alex showed us a page that has a multi-select combo-box that behaved a bit like what we were talking about for category selection for the SJRK storytelling tool. see here: http://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/BrowseByTopic/InfectiousDiseases/AntimicrobialStewardshipProgram/Pages/ASPTool.aspx
2017-09-27T20:24:58 <gmoss> We had a brief discussion about the accessibility of that control, too. it was not readable by a screen reader, but it was decently operable with a keyboard
2017-09-27T20:25:12 <gmoss> Anyway, I thought you might be interested to see it! :)
2017-09-27T20:27:45 <alanharnum> thanks gmoss!
2017-09-27T20:34:11 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: Andrea's so nice :)
2017-09-27T20:34:17 <colinclark> that was a great conversation
