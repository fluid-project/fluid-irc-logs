2017-08-29T14:22:53 <danayo> hi jhung, a quick question about that Read more link text comment here https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/58
2017-08-29T14:23:06 <danayo> you\'re refering to the visible link text, right?

2017-08-29T15:01:05 <jhung> danayo: this is for my comment on the "Read more" link?
2017-08-29T15:01:09 * clown joined the channel
2017-08-29T15:04:32 <danayo> yes jhung
2017-08-29T15:05:21 <jhung> yeah danayo. I was thinking that the visible text links should be more descriptive than just "Read more" three times.
2017-08-29T15:05:22 <danayo> I made the change assuming that\'s what you meant.
2017-08-29T15:05:25 <danayo> yes
2017-08-29T15:05:28 <danayo> I think that\'s a good idea
2017-08-29T15:05:38 <danayo> I agree it was a bit confusing

2017-08-29T15:33:32 <Jess_> oops, i think i missed standup, as i think it was planning today and my irc client was hung unbeknownst to me \xe2\x80\x94 DEEP all morning \xe2\x80\x94 CFI reporting all afternoon
2017-08-29T15:34:05 <jhung> Jess_: we had our planning meeting today so we didn\'t have a standup. :)

2017-08-29T17:08:48 <jhung> danayo: I checked the behaviour of the figcaption details summary and description with screen readers. It works fine in NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.
2017-08-29T17:09:32 <jhung> There\'s a little quirk with VoiceOver in that it reads back the improper state on the dtails box (it says it\'s expanded when it\'s in fact closed). But otherwise seems to be okay.
2017-08-29T17:10:03 <jhung> So I think the only issue left is the CSS addition danayo.

2017-08-29T20:35:51 <danayo> alanharnum: I\'m about to create a new google doc to put together TIG\'s and Columbia partner\'s work plans. Wanted to make sure I wasn\'t duplicating any work you\'ve done or are doing
2017-08-29T20:36:05 <alanharnum> danayo: nope, sounds good
2017-08-29T20:36:07 <alanharnum> thanks!
2017-08-29T20:36:34 <danayo> ok. and I guess the doc needs to include budget breakdown, right?
2017-08-29T20:37:37 <danayo> alanharnum ^?
2017-08-29T20:38:40 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah, as much as possible I\'d try to put Columbia\'s breakdown into TIG\'s structure
2017-08-29T20:39:19 <danayo> ok
2017-08-29T20:40:26 <alanharnum> i\'m going to follow up with Catalina about her budget / work plan
2017-08-29T20:46:25 <danayo> ok great alanharnum
2017-08-29T20:46:52 <danayo> and we haven\'t heard back from Karisma about the budget, have we alanharnum? re the sept-sept dates ?
2017-08-29T20:47:27 <alanharnum> danayo: nope - although it sounds from Iris that we can back date if needed
2017-08-29T20:47:54 <danayo> the backdating was for TIG, no?
2017-08-29T20:48:10 <danayo> but I guess we could backdate theirs too
