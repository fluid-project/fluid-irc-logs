2017-12-08T15:15:19 <sepidehshahi> Hi Justin_o, do you know if there is any way to track how many websites have integrated UIO after DSpace is launched? we are trying to track the impact of P4A project. So, a growing number of sites that integrated UIO can show a positive impact
2017-12-08T15:16:23 * michelled joined the channel
2017-12-08T15:16:59 * danayo joined the channel
2017-12-08T15:18:43 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: not really.... we don't have any tracking mechanism in UIO.
2017-12-08T15:19:09 <sepidehshahi> ok, thanks Justin_o
2017-12-08T15:20:47 <Justin_o> sorry.. sepidehshahi there may be a way to get some idea of how many times Infusion is used but getting the download_count from the release on GitHub https://help.github.com/articles/getting-the-download-count-for-your-releases/
2017-12-08T15:21:14 <Justin_o> or the download count from npm but those will be pretty fuzzy because we don't know what they are being downloaded for.
2017-12-08T15:21:29 <Justin_o> and there are other ways to get infusion, for example cloning the repo
2017-12-08T15:21:39 <sepidehshahi> exactly, and downloadin it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean integrating it in their site
2017-12-08T15:21:46 <Justin_o> correct
2017-12-08T15:32:28 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-12-08T15:38:04 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: is there any demo, documention, link or anything related to UIO+ that I can include in the P4A report?
2017-12-08T15:39:24 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: there is a beta release that is unlisted on the chrome web store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek
2017-12-08T15:39:38 <Justin_o> it's in beta, it hasn't been fully tested yet
2017-12-08T15:42:55 <sepidehshahi> this is great! thanks Justin_o
2017-12-08T15:43:08 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: np
2017-12-08T15:43:22 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i'm about to head offline.. is there anything else you might need for UIO or UIO+?
2017-12-08T15:43:46 <michelled> sepidehshahi, Justin_o: would a screen shot of UIO+ be useful for the repot?
2017-12-08T15:45:41 <sepidehshahi> that would be useful michelled. and Justin_o this is sufficient. thanks
2017-12-08T15:46:20 <michelled> Justin_o: can you send her a screen shot :)
2017-12-08T15:46:47 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, michelled: what would you like for the screenshot?
2017-12-08T15:48:01 <sepidehshahi> actually Justin_o I cant take a screenshot from the beta version. so it\xe2\x80\x99s all good for now. have a great weekend.
2017-12-08T15:51:19 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: okay... have a good weekend too.. if you need anything else, send me an e-mail.
