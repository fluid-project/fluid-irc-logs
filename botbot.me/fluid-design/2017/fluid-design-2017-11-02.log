2017-11-02T17:19:36 <lliskovoi> very similar content to the UoT workshop we did
2017-11-02T17:22:02 <lliskovoi> (10am-1pm)
2017-11-02T17:24:45 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: let me look at calendar RQ
2017-11-02T17:25:42 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: yes, that should work for me
2017-11-02T17:32:22 <lliskovoi> wonderful alanharnum! I'll finish up a call with Jess and then get in touch about details. Thank you!!
2017-11-02T17:45:43 <lliskovoi> alanharnum: do you have time to check in at some point today?
2017-11-02T17:46:06 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: now works if that works for you
2017-11-02T17:46:23 <alanharnum> otherwise some time after 4:00?
2017-11-02T17:46:39 <lliskovoi> sure, lets chat now, my room on Vidyo?
2017-11-02T17:47:05 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: sounds good
2017-11-02T18:09:36 <grrrero> lliskovoi: B&W SNOW looks good \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc
2017-11-02T18:09:58 <lliskovoi> awesome! thanks grrrero!
2017-11-02T18:15:09 <grrrero> danayo lliskovoi jhung Caren_ I've got a question for you -- how do you apply UX research in inclusive design? What common behaviours are usually observed for something that's supposed to be used by as diverse a group as possible?
2017-11-02T18:15:28 <grrrero> UX is so focused on designing for specific personas -- how does it work with inclusive desigsn?
2017-11-02T18:21:32 <danayo> hmm grrrero seems like a longer conversation - I\xe2\x80\x99m not totally sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking re: common behaviours? In terms of UX research, it seems like I always have to do a bit of a \xe2\x80\x9ctranslation\xe2\x80\x9d or reframing for inclusive design - if that makes sense - I\xe2\x80\x99ll come across something interesting re: UX design but then realise it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take inclusion/a11y into account, and so I try to think about how to use it in an inclusive way, if at all
2017-11-02T18:22:52 <danayo> do you mean common user behaviours?
2017-11-02T18:22:52 <grrrero> Thanks danayo, that makes sense. But I guess I want to know -- what's your thought process for thinking about how to use it in an inclusive way?
2017-11-02T18:22:56 <grrrero> Yeah!
2017-11-02T18:23:25 <danayo> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about common user behaviours - I think we want to avoid going there, and instead think about adaptability/customisation
2017-11-02T18:23:32 <grrrero> I see
2017-11-02T18:23:36 <grrrero> That makes sense
2017-11-02T18:24:54 <danayo> Jess_, alanharnum - confirming we\xe2\x80\x99re meeting at 3? 3:30 would work better for me if possible
2017-11-02T18:25:15 <alanharnum> danayo Jess_: that would work fine for me, happy to meet at 3:30
2017-11-02T18:25:27 <Jess_> alanharnum: danayo works for me
2017-11-02T18:25:58 <danayo> great
2017-11-02T18:26:00 * jhung joined the channel
2017-11-02T18:27:55 <jhung> grrrero: I'm back. Meet in 5 minutes?
2017-11-02T18:27:55 <Caren_> grrrero: great question. As an inclusive designer I try to practice co-design as much as is possible. colin\xe2\x80\x99s recent post is really quite interesting: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Technology+Futurist+Talk+at+the+2017+Coleman+Institute+Conference+on+Cognitive+Disability+and+Technology
2017-11-02T18:28:08 <grrrero> jhung: Sure!!
2017-11-02T18:28:40 <grrrero> Oh that's awesome, thanks so much Caren_
2017-11-02T18:28:41 <danayo> and yes co-design grrrero, Caren_!
2017-11-02T18:28:43 <grrrero> Super helpful
2017-11-02T18:28:57 <grrrero> Yes yes never underestimate co-designing :)
2017-11-02T18:31:32 <Caren_> I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that who is around the table in co-design practices is the key to  inclusion\xe2\x80\xa6grrrero danayo ?
2017-11-02T18:31:57 <danayo> +1 Caren_
2017-11-02T18:32:07 <grrrero> I agree Caren_!
2017-11-02T18:32:45 <jhung> grrrero: I'm in my Vidyo room.
2017-11-02T18:37:05 <michelled> avtar: wanna meet to talk CI?
2017-11-02T18:37:40 <avtar> michelled: does 3:00 work for you?
2017-11-02T18:37:54 <michelled> yep

2017-11-02T19:35:06 <Caren_> danayo: is there somewhere on the wiki I can put the IEP hacked form that makes sense? somewhere in the SJRK?
2017-11-02T19:38:40 <michelled> Caren_: maybe under Floe? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe
2017-11-02T19:41:48 <Caren_> sure michelled Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s Research and analysis OR Conceptual designs\xe2\x80\xa6thoughts?

2017-11-02T20:59:52 <danayo> hi Caren_ : sorry for delay - I see you put it under Floe/Research and Analysis - I think that\xe2\x80\x99s great, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll add a link to it from SJRK as well
2017-11-02T21:01:24 * clown has quit
2017-11-02T21:04:24 <Caren_> thanks danayo
2017-11-02T21:04:35 <danayo> thankYOU! Caren_ :O
2017-11-02T21:04:42 <danayo> oops that was meant to be a :)
2017-11-02T21:05:05 <Caren_> hahah it made me laugh out loud.
2017-11-02T21:05:24 <danayo> but maybe :0 because it\xe2\x80\x99s so awesome :D
2017-11-02T21:05:24 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-11-02T21:08:07 <Caren_> thanks for suggesting it live on the wiki danayo. It\xe2\x80\x99s got me thinking about the hack as something that can be built on. If it evolves in my real-life scenario I\xe2\x80\x99ll document it. If it gets iterated on in SJRK or otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99d love to learn from that.
2017-11-02T21:11:07 <danayo> that sounds great Caren_ . Definitely - I will be sure to share it directly with our SJRK partners - also seems relevant to MyL3 - makes me think about how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on a way to allow users to author their own prompts
2017-11-02T21:11:54 <Caren_> :D
