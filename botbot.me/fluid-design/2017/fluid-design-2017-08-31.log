2017-08-31T13:21:05 <Caren> Justin_o: morning Justin. Do you know if I still have administrator access to the Fluid Wiki? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to change the underlying grid template I used in the Project Template to be more agile and I just figured out how to do that. #neverfinished
2017-08-31T13:23:04 <Caren> Justin_o: Cancel that! I\xe2\x80\x99m in. :-)

2017-08-31T14:03:12 <michelled> jhung: I think Dana wanted to continue the SJRK crit the following week
2017-08-31T14:03:24 <michelled> also, the message she sent to the SJRK list said it would be at 1:00
2017-08-31T14:05:39 <jhung> michelled: got it. I'm sending out a correction now.
2017-08-31T14:06:13 <michelled> thanks!
2017-08-31T14:07:05 <jhung> It was all a test to see who was actually reading those emails. :D
2017-08-31T14:29:46 <michelled> haha
2017-08-31T14:30:14 <michelled> jhung: I also noticed a tiny typo in the new Floe news - there is a double 'has' in the second paragraph
2017-08-31T14:30:33 <michelled> that news is great, btw! I love the way the touch notes were explained
2017-08-31T14:38:23 <jhung> michelled: ok. I'll fix that now.
2017-08-31T14:39:11 <michelled> thx!

2017-08-31T15:22:56 <Caren> jhung: is the self-assessment learning tool in prototype to explore?
2017-08-31T15:23:10 <Caren> would love to see it
2017-08-31T15:31:13 <jhung> Caren: I'm not directly involved in that. Not sure if there's a prototype.
2017-08-31T15:40:27 <Caren> ok, thanks jhung. Your news item piqued my interest! :-)
2017-08-31T15:43:01 <michelled> Caren, jhung: the only prototype was built a long time ago and doesn't cover the current wireframes
2017-08-31T15:43:14 <michelled> we'll likely pick up some of this development early next year
2017-08-31T15:46:38 <Caren> thanks, michelled

2017-08-31T17:51:39 <gmoss> alanharnum: no problem! sure I'm available whenever you are
2017-08-31T17:52:25 <alanharnum> gmoss: gimme a few to make a cup of tea, will let you know

2017-08-31T18:01:07 <jhung> Caren: Should I start transcribing the ESP findings / process doc (with edits) to the Wiki?
