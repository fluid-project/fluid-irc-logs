2017-05-10T16:31:17 <danayo> jhung here is the SJRK wiki page. the meeting notes might be a good place to start to wrap your head around the project. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit
2017-05-10T16:33:09 <danayo> this is the doc that alan and I started, but we've just begun so it will be more helpful once we flesh it out - but some of the questions for our partners might be informative https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zj46AYQ5uokDpZXaUYxGvt3x-MtyDMAHdbMVmJZrJU/edit?usp=sharing
2017-05-10T16:33:48 <danayo> we also did some mapping but that may confuse matters! https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1oO1hP-ULeNJXjXr1vW-YcmnHIBaEGRFC2itVdT_XNUo/edit?usp=sharing

2017-05-10T19:59:26 <Caren> jhung and everyone: I\xe2\x80\x99ve started to outline a reflection doc for the Create-a-Thon. Is there a postmortem/reflection template or process that has been applied to past events? Something I should build from? thanks

2017-05-10T20:05:05 <jhung> Caren: There might be some examples on the wiki, and I don't know of any particular template. Usually a structure emerges once the thoughts / notes get put down.
