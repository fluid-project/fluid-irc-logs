2017-02-01T16:58:09 <danayo> jhung: do you recall if we\'ve ever done any usability testing on mobile? For the privacy work, the designs we have now are for mobile, and Caren and I were discussing whether we should also create a desktop version for testing as I\'m unsure about building an accessible mobile prototype

2017-02-01T17:00:38 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-02-01T17:03:58 <jhung> danayo: If "done right" your desktop version and mobile version should provide equivalent experiences. I would suggest building a prototype for mobile first, using the established best practices, which should give you a usable desktop version as well. Does that make sense?
2017-02-01T17:05:00 <danayo> kind of jhung, I guess I don\'t know enough about the prototype-building tool itself (InVision) to know whether that\'s possible
2017-02-01T17:05:16 <danayo> ideally that would be the case
2017-02-01T17:05:24 <danayo> that it would create an equivalent experience
2017-02-01T17:07:12 <jhung> Ah, I thought the prototype was going to be made using HTML, CSS, and JS. In that case I would stick with mobile first since designing for that generally gets you further along to a desktop version than trying to go the opposite direction.
2017-02-01T17:07:15 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-02-01T17:12:35 <danayo> thanks jhung, yeah, I guess it might mean that with touch, we\'ll be limited by the accessibility features of the O/S or even what\'s possible with the prototyping tool itself
2017-02-01T17:21:09 <jhung> danayo: that\'s true. I guess if the tool is somewhat limited for mobile you can always look into a different prototyping tool (if mobile is important), or go with desktop prototype if that\'s sufficient.
2017-02-01T17:22:04 <danayo> thanks jhung

2017-02-01T17:43:05 <jessm> and i really love that at the end of that post they point to \xe2\x80\x9cother resources\xe2\x80\x9d to check out
2017-02-01T17:43:15 <jessm> including the BC campus a11y toolkit

2017-02-01T18:36:44 <Caren> danayo I\'ve familiarized myself with inVision and synced to my iPhone. It\'s working fine. Here is my plan: design static pages in Ai, pull PDFs in to inVision and then layer the interaction onto each page.
2017-02-01T18:38:29 <danayo> that sounds great Caren. I was playing with it a bit myself to get a sense of what we\'ll need for sequencing all the frames
2017-02-01T18:38:37 <jessm> jhung: i think for two reasons: 1. it\xe2\x80\x99s already happening and fresh and 2. it\xe2\x80\x99s at an institution with folks who want to help make it accessible. Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s plan is to have 3 audits to get folks on the same page re: what matters
2017-02-01T18:39:19 <danayo> Caren: I need to confirm the cause/effect of the checkboxes and the items that will appear in the cloud
2017-02-01T18:39:39 <danayo> but I hope that won\'t hold you back ?
2017-02-01T18:40:29 <danayo> Caren: I plan to firm it up before you\'re back on Monday
2017-02-01T18:42:09 <Caren> danayo there doesn\'t seem to be a visual branching/sequencing mode on inVision. Will need to get my visual mind around that! lol.
2017-02-01T18:42:54 <Caren> No problem danayo. I can work on individual asset renderings and type system specs.
2017-02-01T18:43:25 <Caren> The sequencing is so important! Take the time you need.
2017-02-01T18:44:03 <jhung> jessm: that makes a lot of sense. That Hugh is a smart one! :)
2017-02-01T18:44:27 <jessm> jhung: :P
2017-02-01T18:45:16 <danayo> ok Caren, great.  When we did this last, Sepideh created a visual sequencing first (in InDesign) - here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0oau8ygtbnkyfr4/PGA%20Workshop%20FD%20Tool%20Mockup.indd?dl=0
2017-02-01T18:45:30 <danayo> (not sure why she used InDesign, I\'ve emailed her to ask)
2017-02-01T18:45:40 <danayo> but perhaps we should do the same Caren
2017-02-01T18:46:07 <danayo> actually Caren ...
2017-02-01T18:46:15 <danayo> I\'ll give you a link to the pdf that lays it all out
2017-02-01T18:47:20 <danayo> Caren: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jx4yik022amqku7/FD%20Tool-Rebranding-Sepi.pdf?dl=0
2017-02-01T18:49:04 <Caren> it may be that inDesign was easiest for her to render this map in
2017-02-01T18:49:29 <Caren> Yes, this is what will need to be done with Privacy app
2017-02-01T18:50:07 <danayo> Caren: ah, so the map can be rendered directly from InDesign? there\'s a way to do that?
2017-02-01T18:50:59 <danayo> I see you can add a "Go to Page" option
2017-02-01T18:51:03 <danayo> from buttons
2017-02-01T18:51:07 <Caren> that map would have been done by "hand" likely with each screen frame imported as an image
2017-02-01T18:51:16 <danayo> ah, ok Caren
2017-02-01T18:51:22 <Caren> It\'s intended as a static map I think?
2017-02-01T18:51:34 <danayo> yes, the pdf is a static map
2017-02-01T18:51:37 <Caren> to illustrate the possible sequencing
2017-02-01T18:51:42 <danayo> yes
2017-02-01T18:52:00 <danayo> I just got excited for a moment Caren, cuz I thought perhaps there was an easy way to render a map from InDesign!
2017-02-01T18:52:21 <Caren> I would also assume that was sketched out manually
2017-02-01T18:52:28 <Caren> Ha! I wish
2017-02-01T18:52:31 <danayo> :)
2017-02-01T18:53:21 <Caren> \xe2\x80\xa6sketched out manually first to work out the proper sequencing prior to committing it to inDesign
2017-02-01T18:55:00 <danayo> ahhhhh I think I see .... yes, and I think we made an interactive pdf directly from InDesign Caren
2017-02-01T18:55:06 <danayo> it\'s all coming back to me :)
2017-02-01T18:55:10 <danayo> we didn\'t use InVision that time
2017-02-01T18:55:14 <danayo> hmmm
2017-02-01T18:55:50 <danayo> so ... manual map --> InDesign creation of interactives (buttons etc) --> interactive pdf

2017-02-01T18:57:07 <danayo> I was wondering if perhaps we should do the same, if it\'s easier, but wasn\'t sure about touch/mobile, though I do see that there is an interactive option for "on tap" Caren
2017-02-01T18:57:38 <danayo> hmmm and options for Animations too
2017-02-01T18:57:40 <Caren> ah, ok. Let me have a look at creating interactive via creative suite
2017-02-01T18:58:09 <danayo> thanks Caren (and I think the animations are just simple ones - i.e. sliding L/R etc from one frame to next)
2017-02-01T18:58:15 <Caren> I know folks who have done that but I haven\'t\xe2\x80\xa6I don\'t believe it\'s to difficult
2017-02-01T18:58:40 <Caren> yes, that\'s right, not overly complex interaction.
2017-02-01T18:59:41 <Caren> one thing I was interested in with inVision was the overlay windows for the "silo" or extra/deeper info. But we may be able to work around that in creative suite.
2017-02-01T18:59:54 <Caren> I\'ll report back once I dig more.
2017-02-01T18:59:58 <danayo> yes, I noticed that Overlay option too - thanks Caren
2017-02-01T19:00:04 <Caren> thanks Danayo
