2017-09-21T15:20:14 <danayo> jhung: i\'m looking for resources about creating accessible pdfs. I see there are some links here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Accessibility+Resources and was also looking at the WebAIM site https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/converting
2017-09-21T15:20:39 <danayo> do you know of any other good resources?
2017-09-21T15:22:05 <danayo> I guess maybe this too? http://adod.idrc.ocad.ca/

2017-09-21T15:50:35 <sepidehshahi> perfect!
2017-09-21T15:50:50 <avtar> grrrero: would you like to chat now?
2017-09-21T15:50:57 <grrrero> Yep avtar
2017-09-21T15:53:23 <danayo> fluid-everyone: this was andrea\'s specific question "because I use a Mac I had to do the Word to PDF converting on a non-Mac computer with the Acrobat plugin for Word because Word for Mac strips document formatting. I wonder if you know if there is now a way to make accessible PDFs only using a Mac? I have heard tell that OpenOffice could work -- thoughts?"

2017-09-21T15:54:13 <Justin_o> danayo: i don\'t know the answer, but am curious which version of word for mac was being used. Was it the latest?
2017-09-21T15:54:44 <danayo> I think she\'s referring to work she did some time ago - don\'t know the version specifically
2017-09-21T15:55:01 <gmoss> danayo: LibreOffice/OpenOffice may work, I\'ve used it successfully on Windows for years

2017-09-21T16:10:14 <Caren_> Jess_ might we want to look at the existing phases of procurement and develop a matrix with that and verticals (edu, health care, etc.)? https://buyandsell.gc.ca/for-government/buying-for-the-government-of-canada/the-procurement-rules-and-process/phases-of-the-procurement-process#pre-contractual

2017-09-21T16:21:18 <Jess_> ohhhhh Caren_ this is great
2017-09-21T16:22:16 <Jess_> Caren_: it would be really useful if you collect some of these links in an appendix in the google doc we\xe2\x80\x99re working in
2017-09-21T16:22:23 <Caren_> Jess_perhaps activities around each phase with the strawperson model applied\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-09-21T16:22:29 <Jess_> i think some pre-reading for participants is potentially really useful
2017-09-21T16:22:31 <Caren_> Ok, Jess_ I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that now
2017-09-21T16:22:44 <Jess_> i quite like the gc.ca page too!
2017-09-21T16:23:41 <Caren_> yes, agree
2017-09-21T16:28:34 <Caren_> Jess_ do you have a link to the list of verticals you were looking at in our meeting?
2017-09-21T16:28:48 <Jess_> Caren_: i plunked it into the appendix in the doc

2017-09-21T18:03:51 <grrrero> danayo: Oh found it
2017-09-21T18:04:03 <danayo> ok great
2017-09-21T18:33:01 <Jess_> alanharnum: this is great https://gist.github.com/waharnum/83abbef3f7ec2f850b9add43b62edd8a might want to check in with jhung about a similar-ish page in the wiki and \xe2\x80\x98harmonize\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 I am not a fan of that word
2017-09-21T18:35:34 <jhung> alanharnum: I had started a guide on the wiki which attempts to collect the scenarios I keep running into when talking with partners and their projects. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Making+an+Inclusive+and+Accessible+Website
2017-09-21T18:36:12 <jhung> It\'s a high-level document which is a little technical but above all tries to explain the reasons why someone would want to go the extra mile to make improvements.
2017-09-21T18:37:00 <jhung> Mostly targeted to project leads who have developers / designers working with them or hired to work on their projects.
2017-09-21T18:37:40 <Jess_> fwiw alanharnum and jhung i\xe2\x80\x99m going to point to both as great resources for how to get started on a11y

2017-09-21T19:12:13 <alanharnum> thanks Jess_! and yeah, this is a great guide jhung started - I think with what I scrawled down I\'m trying to anticipate developer oriented questions
2017-09-21T19:14:42 <alanharnum> comment on importance of clear text, A++
2017-09-21T19:15:25 <alanharnum> i was talking about this last night at dinner with some people - the challenges of writing website content, getting enough attention paid to content writing as an element of UX and accessibility
2017-09-21T19:22:50 <grrrero> danayo: Do you have the images for the new redesign somewhere on ownCloud?

2017-09-21T19:34:54 <Caren_> Jess_ do you have 5 mins?
2017-09-21T19:35:13 <Jess_> Caren_: after 4ish
2017-09-21T19:35:30 <danayo> np grrrero. I was just reducing the file size by rasterizing all the images - it\'s still pretty big though. I should probably get in the habit of linking images instead of embedding them
2017-09-21T19:35:38 <Caren_> ok I\xe2\x80\x99ll find you then :) Jess_
2017-09-21T19:36:00 <grrrero> danayo: No problem!
