2017-08-24T15:48:26 <jhung> fluid-everyone: An interesting survey of terminology used in Canada. It\'s a good reminder how the choice of words matter\xe2\x80\xa6 http://www.the10and3.com/this-is-how-canada-talks/ Sample size was 9500, and the survey doesn\'t indicate what was the geographic distribution was (which will affect the validity of results). Interesting nonetheless.

2017-08-24T17:45:50 <danayo> gmoss, alanharnum : do you have any thoughts on what would be best to prioritize re: the storytelling tool in terms of the dev work? I was going to put some time to thinking through the translation flow based on the crit discussion - seems like a priority from the perspective of user experience
2017-08-24T17:47:27 <danayo> but there\'s also the tags/categories piece - but maybe we could start by just allowing free-form tagging
2017-08-24T17:49:00 <gmoss> danayo: I think it would be good for alanharnum and me to get together to discuss how we\'ll store the language info and translated stories... it\'s a good question. some further detail in the design would help us make a more educated decision though!
2017-08-24T17:49:00 <gmoss> The tags, as they\'re implemented currently, are a free-form system and are stored in our database in a format that can be searched, so we could also spend some time fleshing that out a bit
2017-08-24T17:50:02 <alanharnum> danayo gmoss: I think the translation is an important aspect of this, and as with all things multilingual, will probably be easier if the development is worked on sooner rather than later, so +1 to that

2017-08-24T17:59:25 <alanharnum> danayo gmoss: btw, I pushed the changes to our deployment branch, so work from yesterday is up at http://build.fluidproject.org/sjrk-storyTelling/
2017-08-24T18:07:59 <danayo> ok, thanks gmoss & alanharnum!  I\'ll start with the translation piece
2017-08-24T18:09:32 <alanharnum> danayo: great - on that note, gmoss, should we talk about managing translations?
2017-08-24T18:12:40 <gmoss> alanharnum: yeah I\'m free whenever! I\'m just working on hiding/showing the heading depending on the section, right now

2017-08-24T18:15:11 <danayo> one quick thing I just noticed gmoss and alanharnum: I think "Listen to my story" should read the title (and author) as well. So I think the Listen button (in the preview as well as the viewer) will have to move to appear above/before the title
2017-08-24T18:16:01 <danayo> I think it\'s ok where it is in the editor though
2017-08-24T18:16:32 <gmoss> danayo: yes that\'s a good point! I believe alanharnum and I have discussed reading out the title and author in the past, but we hadn\'t got around to implementing it yet. the positioning should be easy enough to change :)
2017-08-24T18:16:40 <danayo> cool

2017-08-24T19:06:53 <danayo> hi grrrero, was just going through your wiki page on icon fonts
2017-08-24T19:07:08 <danayo> I think it could use a little more instruction detail about using actions
2017-08-24T19:08:11 <danayo> I\'ve never used them before, and got a bit confused about the action paths/layers
2017-08-24T19:08:33 <danayo> i.e. which one to choose
2017-08-24T19:11:49 <danayo> also I\'m not sure how I can use a scaling action while constraining proportions - i.e. if I choose scale width to 64px, it\'s not constraining the height
2017-08-24T19:13:51 <grrrero> Hi danayo: re: contraining proportions, I\'m still trying to see if there\'s a script to do that in one go; but assuming your icon is square, usually scaling by width is fine. If the icon is a bit bigger in height, you\'ll want to scale by height...if that makes sense?
2017-08-24T19:15:40 <danayo> yeah, that makes sense if it\'s already square
