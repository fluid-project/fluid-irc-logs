2017-09-14T14:44:45 <Jess_> i have a call at 11 so it might make sense to get going after that?

2017-09-14T15:10:42 <danayo> sepidehshahi: thanks for asking that question about what exactly we are trying to do :)
2017-09-14T15:11:57 <danayo> very helpful to get us thinking about how we will describe the co-design session re: what we actually want to achieve
2017-09-14T15:12:32 <sepidehshahi> sorry danayo if I made you repead our conversation yesterday :) since we had only one more meeting before the co-design session I wanted to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll be on the right track
2017-09-14T15:13:22 <danayo> for sure sepidehshahi it is a very important question!
2017-09-14T15:14:06 <sepidehshahi> yes, it helps us with structuring the session and also if you are invitining people who are new to the, that would help them better get involved.
2017-09-14T15:14:19 <sepidehshahi> it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very exciting session :)
2017-09-14T15:14:25 <danayo> it is! :D
2017-09-14T15:25:55 <sepidehshahi> Hi Caren_ danayo and I are looking for examples of the invitations we sent out for our codesign sessions. I was wondering if you had used one for the PhET create-a-thon.

2017-09-14T19:18:26 <jhung> Ok.
2017-09-14T19:18:36 <jhung> When was this site created?
2017-09-14T19:18:39 <jhung> gtirloni:
2017-09-14T19:22:28 <jhung> I\'ll let Julia know. I\'m sure she\'ll be happy because I\'ve been telling her about the evils of using the Wordpress editor and how things can get messed up. :)
2017-09-14T19:26:07 <gtirloni> just now
2017-09-14T19:33:32 <jhung> gtirloni: awesome. Thanks. I\'ll let Julia know.

2017-09-14T20:23:28 <alanharnum> this is a very good 30-minute overview on CSS grid
2017-09-14T20:23:37 <alanharnum> https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/Microsoft-Edge-Web-Summit-2017/ES08
2017-09-14T20:24:01 <alanharnum> notably, presenter, who works on the MS Edge team, says CSS Grid will start shipping in public builds of Edge in October
2017-09-14T20:24:13 <alanharnum> which I believe means the Big 3 will all have full support

2017-09-14T21:57:12 <danayo> colinclark: was going to post the notes from today\'s BiT meeting then realised I don\'t think we have a wiki page yet for that project - I can create one if that sounds good to you
2017-09-14T21:57:26 <colinclark> sure, that\'d be awesome, danayo
2017-09-14T21:57:29 <colinclark> thanks for offering
2017-09-14T21:57:34 <danayo> np
2017-09-14T22:53:58 <danayo> colinclark: page is here
2017-09-14T22:53:59 <danayo> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Bodies+in+Translation
2017-09-14T22:54:02 <danayo> bare bones for now
2017-09-14T22:54:21 <danayo> but have added link to meeting notes and info about next meetings
2017-09-14T22:54:24 <colinclark> that\'s great
2017-09-14T22:54:26 <colinclark> thank you
2017-09-14T23:01:43 <danayo> colinclark: can you remind me how one sets up an account on the wiki? I want to let them know how to contribute
2017-09-14T23:01:55 <colinclark> that\'s a good question :)
2017-09-14T23:02:17 <colinclark> Looks like you can go to this URL: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/signup.action
2017-09-14T23:02:21 <danayo> it\'s funny, it should be on our Get Involved page, but there\'s just a general link to confluence stuff
2017-09-14T23:02:32 <colinclark> yes, that is funny!
2017-09-14T23:02:58 <danayo> like, not LOL funny, but "that\'s weird" funny :D
2017-09-14T23:03:10 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-14T23:03:12 <colinclark> :)
2017-09-14T23:04:34 <danayo> thanks - is there a link to that signup page somewhere? couldn\'t find it
2017-09-14T23:05:39 <colinclark> yup
2017-09-14T23:05:45 <colinclark> it\'s in the top right corner when you\'re not logged in
2017-09-14T23:05:48 <colinclark> pretty prominent
2017-09-14T23:06:20 <danayo> ah, of course, thanks, I was logged in :p
2017-09-14T23:18:28 <colinclark> I was confused at first too
