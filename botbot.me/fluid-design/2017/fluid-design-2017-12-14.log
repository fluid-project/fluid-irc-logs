2017-12-14T18:57:40 <colinclark> oh, thank you
2017-12-14T18:57:41 <colinclark> that\'s great
2017-12-14T18:57:52 <danayo> thanks alanharnum
2017-12-14T19:09:15 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss, colinclark, michelled and everyone: interesting example of a first-person video story related to social activism, from Inclusion BC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYXuPsLkYVI

2017-12-14T19:42:48 <colinclark> danayo, sepidehshahi: I have no idea if what I was getting at made any sense :)
2017-12-14T19:42:53 <colinclark> in regards to codesign activities
2017-12-14T19:43:13 <colinclark> but I\'m thinking of finding ways to get the participants to actually make the knowledge platform, in their own way
2017-12-14T19:43:45 <colinclark> and to do so by mixing and matching and combining lots of different kinds of potential content, and then to point out the gaps or problems or new ideas
2017-12-14T19:43:58 <colinclark> and to reify this in some physical form
2017-12-14T19:43:59 <danayo_> colinclark: it totally did - I think it could be really effective
2017-12-14T19:44:11 <colinclark> where "gaps" could actually be, say, empty spaces :)
2017-12-14T19:44:12 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: I think the process you were describing made sense to me. we have to do more thinking of techniques or different ways to make it practical
2017-12-14T19:44:17 <colinclark> yes
2017-12-14T19:44:31 <colinclark> and I think it will be a fair bit of work because we\'ll have to identify real content
2017-12-14T19:44:37 <colinclark> and put it together in a suitable form
2017-12-14T19:44:41 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-12-14T19:44:51 <colinclark> and there has to be enough of it that people don\'t get stuck on a single instance of it
2017-12-14T19:45:01 <colinclark> where they\'re lik "no, no, it should be [this totally other thing]"
2017-12-14T19:45:09 <danayo_> colinclark: I wonder if it could be effective with placeholders too
2017-12-14T19:45:12 <colinclark> yup
2017-12-14T19:45:20 <danayo_> so it wouldn\'t have to be actual content
2017-12-14T19:45:20 <colinclark> i think a blend of the two could work very well
2017-12-14T19:45:29 <colinclark> and perhaps placeholders could even involve "make your own"
2017-12-14T19:45:44 <colinclark> so prompts to sketch or make notes that fill in the gaps
2017-12-14T19:46:37 <danayo_> i keep picturing pieces of cardboard/foamcore, some with content, some blank that can be drawn on
2017-12-14T19:46:46 <danayo_> like puzzle pieces to put together/move around
2017-12-14T19:46:51 <sepidehshahi> colinclark, danayo: since this is a very new approach for us, I was wondering if we could run a test with our team for one of our projects, so we could tell what is working and what is not
2017-12-14T19:47:08 <danayo_> that would be fun sepidehshahi
2017-12-14T19:47:37 <sepidehshahi> danayo: when you mentioned digital, I was imagining screens where groups could move around digital elements/boxes
2017-12-14T19:47:38 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: brilliant, yes
2017-12-14T19:47:50 <colinclark> I think the key starting place will be, as perhaps it always is, art :)
2017-12-14T19:48:13 <colinclark> we should look at a lot of artwork and use it as the structure for the activity
2017-12-14T19:48:29 <danayo_> oh what a drag - looking at a lot of arwork :)
2017-12-14T19:48:33 <danayo_> sounds great
2017-12-14T19:48:43 <sepidehshahi> for sure! sounds great
2017-12-14T19:48:58 <danayo_> sepidehshahi: yes to moving digital "blocks" around too
2017-12-14T20:02:24 * jhung joined the channel
2017-12-14T20:02:43 <sepidehshahi> danayo_: here is also an idea: we could use iPods, iPads, our old iPhones as digital blocks. So each of them could be dedicated to a specific thing (piece of art/ tech/ history/ video/ interactive game/ etc.) and groups can play around with them or add further capabilities to them to come up with their preferred platform

2017-12-14T20:06:22 * danayo_ joined the channel
2017-12-14T20:06:32 <danayo_> that could be interesting sepidehshahi
2017-12-14T20:06:50 <danayo_> it might also be nice to set up some big monitors where groups could move things around on one screen
2017-12-14T20:07:17 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo_ !
2017-12-14T20:10:38 <gmoss> danayo: Just watched the video you linked, that\'s amazing!
2017-12-14T20:17:16 <danayo> cool gmoss
2017-12-14T20:23:26 <gmoss> It\'s inspiring to see the kind of change one person can effect
