2017-09-08T15:53:34 <Caren_> Jess_: are you able to point me to wordpress stylesheets on the DEEP site? The h1, h2, etc. seem to not be visually relevant to the intented header heirarchy. For example an h4 may be larger or bolder than an h2 on some of the pages. Is that clear as mud??!
2017-09-08T15:54:45 <Caren_> Jess_: I want to change the stylesheets :-)
2017-09-08T15:55:18 <Jess_> Caren_: eek \xe2\x80\x94 that might require jhung
2017-09-08T15:55:47 <Caren_> ok, thanks Jess_
2017-09-08T15:56:00 <Jess_> Caren_: actually maybe not
2017-09-08T15:56:09 <Jess_> in the admin interface you see appearance?
2017-09-08T15:56:13 <Jess_> and the theme and customize
2017-09-08T15:57:19 <Caren_> I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for that but can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to locate it.
2017-09-08T15:58:49 <Caren_> admin interface= panel down left side with Dashboard, posts, media, pages, etc. menu?

2017-09-08T16:02:30 <Jess_> do you see appearance

2017-09-08T16:14:43 <jhung> Caren_: I can help. Can you point me to an example where you want the headers fixed?
2017-09-08T16:18:26 <Caren_> jhung: let me get you specifics. Need to go back into the site. Thanks!

2017-09-08T18:46:49 <gmoss> simonjb: thanks, that\'s excellent!
2017-09-08T18:47:21 <gmoss> now to find out if fluid.textToSpeech will read certain elements in the language of choice...
2017-09-08T18:47:34 <simonjb> indeed :)
2017-09-08T18:49:59 <gmoss> per the w3c doc: "Setting of a language using the lang attribute which does not match the language of the document or document parts will result in some users being unable to understand the content."
2017-09-08T18:50:49 <gmoss> Maybe I\'ll whip up a quick POC to see how this works using fluid TTS vs. NVDA when html has one lang and another element has another
2017-09-08T18:51:19 <grrrero> Hi jhung! I\'ve finished porting the new UIO into the Wordpress plugin -- do you know how we should go about merging that into the Github repo?
2017-09-08T18:51:42 <simonjb> gmoss: sounds like a good plan -- I would be interested in the results
2017-09-08T18:55:05 <jhung> grrrero: assuming you did all your work in a branch in your repo, you would then issue a pull request to get it merged into the master.
2017-09-08T18:56:21 <grrrero> jhung: In this one right >> https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin
2017-09-08T19:03:11 <jhung> yep that\'s the one grrrero

2017-09-08T19:26:39 <jhung> Caren_: I got your email. Do you want those styles applied to the whole site or just the agenda?
2017-09-08T19:27:34 <Caren_> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t dug through the whole site so I think at this point it would be best to just apply it to the agenda
2017-09-08T19:29:13 <jhung> Caren_: ok. I\'ll take a look at it.

2017-09-08T19:35:47 <jhung> Caren_: In the 2017 Agenda page, some of the headers are not actually headers - they\'re just bolded text. For example "Day 1 :\xc2\xa0Wednesday, October 11, 2017" is not a header. Could you go through that page and make sure all the text is formatted properly before I do the styling?
2017-09-08T19:38:12 <Caren_> The formatting example I sent to you was done in inDesign for reference because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how to style independently in WP
2017-09-08T19:42:13 <jhung> ok Caren_. I\'ll fix that up no prob. Just be warned that it may look bad before it gets better.
2017-09-08T19:44:17 <Caren_> Can I do anything to help jhung?
2017-09-08T19:44:50 <Caren_> to make it easier?
2017-09-08T19:45:24 <jhung> Caren_: probably take a look at it once it\'s done to see if it matches what you imagined.
2017-09-08T19:46:17 <Caren_> sure. thanks so much jhung
2017-09-08T19:56:56 <jhung> Wow Caren_. I\'m taking a look at the markup used to make the agenda\xe2\x80\xa6 now I can see why you wanted this fixed. You think it looks bad visually, the markup generated is doubly worse. :)
2017-09-08T19:57:47 <Caren_> eep! NO! nothing like a can of worms on a Friday afternoon
2017-09-08T20:19:21 <colinclark> simonjb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg
2017-09-08T20:19:35 <simonjb> thanks colinclark I\'ll take a look
2017-09-08T20:21:19 <jhung> Caren_: I see that on Day 1 3pm, there are two activities happening in Room 230. Is that correct?
2017-09-08T20:21:37 <jhung> ^ Jess_
2017-09-08T20:22:20 <Caren_> jhung: not sure we know for sure at this point.

2017-09-08T20:26:17 <jhung> Caren_: ok. I\'m going to finish this on Monday. This will take a bit more finessing.
