2017-10-30T18:22:40 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Does anyone have a topic they'd like to share for tomorrow's design crit?
2017-10-30T18:23:29 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for tomorrow jhung
2017-10-30T18:36:17 <jhung> thanks sepidehshahi. danayo, grrrero - anything for tomorrow's design crit?
2017-10-30T18:36:50 <danayo> I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything jhung, thanks
2017-10-30T18:36:54 <grrrero> jhung: I've got this https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2P9X4jYaTysbDNiZmpWalNsSEU/view
2017-10-30T18:37:01 <grrrero> I wanted to write an article for the Ontario Planning Journal
2017-10-30T18:37:08 <grrrero> And maybe it would help to get input from everyone?
2017-10-30T18:37:37 <grrrero> Writing an article about Inclusive Design and how it can be used to improve planning and governance?
2017-10-30T18:37:38 * michelled joined the channel
2017-10-30T18:41:22 <jhung> grrrero: that sounds good. Do you have a link to the article draft so I can include it in the weekly email?
2017-10-30T18:41:48 <grrrero> jhung: I'm working on it still, so I don't have a link yet :(
2017-10-30T18:44:53 <grrrero> I was hoping the design crit could be an avenue to generate ideas
2017-10-30T18:45:08 <grrrero> ^ jhung
2017-10-30T18:51:58 <jhung> grrrero: ok sounds good. Could you describe to me what the article is about and what you'd like feedback on?
2017-10-30T18:54:47 <grrrero> jhung: It's about the importance of inclusive design in civic engagement tools; I'm particularly looking into the methods -- how we can make the civic engagement movement more accessible and less exclusive so that all people, especially those at the edges and whose opinions and viewpoints might matter most (depending on the issue/problem being addressed)
2017-10-30T18:55:02 <grrrero> Does that make sense?
2017-10-30T18:56:29 <jhung> grrrero: sure. I'll send out the email. Thanks!
2017-10-30T18:56:38 <grrrero> Thank you jhung :)
2017-10-30T18:57:09 <jhung> no prob.

2017-10-30T19:39:30 <michelled> danayo: when you get a chance, take a look at the SJRK site on your phone or tablet.
2017-10-30T19:39:42 <michelled> there are still two of the responsive tasks that haven't been done - the breadcrumbs and the tooltip and we'll likely get back to them in january
2017-10-30T19:40:01 <michelled> those are for UIO ^
