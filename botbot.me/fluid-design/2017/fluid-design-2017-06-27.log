2017-06-27T15:12:30 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2017-06-27T15:12:48 <Justin_o> i find the episodes to be on the disturbing side

2017-06-27T15:14:37 <Bosmon> My friend BOGGDANNOVITCH loved this show
2017-06-27T15:14:42 <Bosmon> I couldn\'t make it through the first episode
2017-06-27T15:15:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i definitely was not prepared for that first episode. Still haunts me.
2017-06-27T15:16:41 <Bosmon> But it seems there is now an academic course on this subject
2017-06-27T15:17:55 <Justin_o> really, i didn\'t know that
2017-06-27T15:18:05 <danayo> I prefer the "real life" monster hunting of Stranger Things :)
2017-06-27T15:18:48 <Justin_o> danayo: :) i\'m looking forward to season two of that one
2017-06-27T15:19:20 <danayo> me too Justin_o, I actually just finished watching Season 1
2017-06-27T15:21:39 <colinclark> danayo: monsters and synthesizer soundtrack!
2017-06-27T15:21:43 <colinclark> so good
2017-06-27T15:22:25 <danayo> it is!
2017-06-27T15:22:26 <danayo> i love it
