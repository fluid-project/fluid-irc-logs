2017-04-03T14:02:03 <jhung> Caren: can we do a shorter meeting today?
2017-04-03T14:02:11 <clown> michelled:  I received the email with three attachements
2017-04-03T14:02:20 <clown> thanks
2017-04-03T14:02:20 <Caren> jhung: would you be open to meet later today? I'd like to transcribe a session from Friday
2017-04-03T14:02:58 <jhung> Sure let's try for that Caren. btw, I don't think a full transcription is necessary. Just notes is enough.
2017-04-03T14:03:02 <michelled> great!
2017-04-03T14:10:09 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have time to talk media queries? not sure cindyli but might be useful for you as well if you are still working on enactors
2017-04-03T14:10:49 <Caren> jhung: it's not a full transcription. I need to review and take notes and authentically interpret what the co-designer is saying and doing. I had one co-designer and there was some good complex thinking at points. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82
2017-04-03T14:11:17 <jhung> Justin_o: if it's not urgent, maybe later this week? I have a few things on my plate.
2017-04-03T14:11:50 <Justin_o> jhung: i'd probably need to chat today, but i can just work through it on my own as well
2017-04-03T14:12:05 <jhung> ok Justin_o. Sorry about that.
2017-04-03T14:12:14 <Justin_o> cindyli:  are you interested in chatting about it, i'm curious what your thoughts are based on your recent enactor work
2017-04-03T14:12:16 <Justin_o> jhung: no problem

2017-04-03T14:18:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, want to chat in the channel or in person?
2017-04-03T14:18:57 <cindyli> in person
2017-04-03T14:19:03 <Justin_o> okay, sounds good
2017-04-03T14:19:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: just going to drop a link here first.. https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#units
2017-04-03T14:20:05 <Justin_o> the issue is that media queries that use relative values (e.g. rem, em) are based off the initial font-size and don't take into consideration any declarations.
2017-04-03T14:20:41 <cindyli> sure

2017-04-03T17:08:16 <kathy_> thank you
2017-04-03T17:08:19 <Justin_o> i'd suggest that you fork it into your own github spaces, and work out of branches
2017-04-03T17:08:30 <Justin_o> kathy_: ^
2017-04-03T17:08:50 <Justin_o> did you need a refresher at all for Git stuff?
