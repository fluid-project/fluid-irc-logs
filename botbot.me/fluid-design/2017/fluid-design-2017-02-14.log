2017-02-14T20:18:09 <danayo> thanks Justin_o - for some reason it still looks a little narrower on top to me (though much better)
2017-02-14T20:19:00 <Justin_o> danayo: hmm.. not sure
2017-02-14T20:19:15 <Justin_o> could have something to do with how the text aligns
2017-02-14T20:19:54 <danayo> I have another picky request Justin_o:  could the spacing on the left and right ends, between the currently-selected box and the outer box - be made to match the upper and lower space between same?
2017-02-14T20:22:29 <Justin_o> danayo: sure, i should be able to do that

2017-02-14T16:14:51 <Jess_> nice sleuthing clown !
2017-02-14T16:15:51 <clown> Thanks, Jess_, the real mystery is why I didn\'t remember this stuff until this morning.  I was at those meetings back in \'14.
2017-02-14T16:16:05 <Jess_> so-much-stuff
2017-02-14T16:16:33 <Jess_> clown: i think it would be really useful to capture these two links in the wiki page!
2017-02-14T16:16:50 <clown> oky doky
2017-02-14T16:28:15 <jhung> colinclark: during the crit I said "start from scratch" - I meant it in a way to keep an open mind about the design. Your comment about including actual users is bang on (I was grasping for that). Thanks for making that connection.
2017-02-14T16:28:15 <michelled> danayo: this article reminds me of some of the conversations around first discovery and what sort of information we actually need https://emilyhorsman.com/post/tearing-down-exclusionary-user-input/
2017-02-14T16:29:32 <michelled> Bosmon: in the post, she quotes Carina C. Zona in a way that I think will resonate deeply with the architecture of Infusion:  \xe2\x80\x9cOur schemas have to contain people\xe2\x80\x99s real worlds, regardless of whether we imagine it possible.\xe2\x80\x9d
2017-02-14T16:29:57 <Bosmon> michelled - yes, very good - although perhaps the word "contain" is a bit loaded :)
2017-02-14T16:30:08 <michelled> indeed
2017-02-14T16:30:13 <Bosmon> We might at most want to stretch to "correspond to", but it wouldn\'t read so well :)

2017-02-14T17:11:03 <Justin_o> that should demonstrate the latest implementation i have, but i\'m probably going to redo the markup
2017-02-14T17:11:06 <Justin_o> and css
2017-02-14T17:15:44 <danayo> thanks Jusitn_o. so will the font be different? Also I can get checkmark font icon to you if you need it - I think we have it somewhere already. and is it possible to increase the size of the font for the active state? or sounds like it was causing things to shift around?
2017-02-14T17:18:15 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, caused things to shift
2017-02-14T17:18:44 <Justin_o> danayo: did you want to chat about things for a bit?

2017-02-14T20:07:34 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: what do you think of this version https://jsfiddle.net/zxm507Lg/1/ of the on/off toggle
2017-02-14T20:11:32 <danayo> Justin_o: it\'s looking good. sorry I missed this before - but the box that shows the currently-selected state should be the same size regardless of whether it\'s ON or OFF . also, could the upper spacing (between text and select-box) be made the same as the lower?
2017-02-14T20:14:38 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'ll investigate the former, the latter should be the case.. not sure why it isn\'t
2017-02-14T20:15:23 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
