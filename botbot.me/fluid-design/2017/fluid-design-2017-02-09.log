2017-02-09T18:57:24 <danayo> let me know what you think of that last version Justin_o https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/anranIWzzkwGu9D
2017-02-09T19:01:02 <danayo> oh wait you already did :)
2017-02-09T19:01:50 <Justin_o> :)
2017-02-09T19:02:04 <Justin_o> in summary, i like it.
2017-02-09T19:02:44 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2017-02-09T19:04:56 * clown_mtg has quit
2017-02-09T19:11:19 <danayo> jhung: Justin_o and I were discussing the UIO mobile designs, thought just having the button disappear might be best, like so: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/anranIWzzkwGu9D
2017-02-09T19:27:16 <danayo> here it is at max size Justin_o, jhung: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/QkDWHUkmfjfjmgF
2017-02-09T19:27:53 <Justin_o> danayo: does the textfield get smaller in width?
2017-02-09T19:28:23 <danayo> if that\'s possible Justin_o, but we could also start with it narrow
2017-02-09T19:28:33 <danayo> otherwise we\'d have to put the buttons underneath maybe
2017-02-09T19:29:05 <Justin_o> danayo: i see, hmm.. i think the textfield is sized based on the text, so it\'ll probably get wider with the text size..
2017-02-09T19:29:10 <Justin_o> but maybe there\'s a way.
2017-02-09T19:29:17 <danayo> ah right Justin_o
2017-02-09T19:31:56 <Justin_o> danayo: are there contrast designs for the checkbox toggle things
2017-02-09T19:33:28 <danayo> Justin_o: no not specifically, they\'ll just be high contrast black on white, and inverted, etc, but I can sketch those up
2017-02-09T19:33:48 <danayo> you mean the on/off toggles, right?
2017-02-09T19:33:54 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, that thing
2017-02-09T19:34:03 <danayo> that THING!
2017-02-09T19:34:09 <Justin_o> :)
2017-02-09T19:48:33 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-02-09T19:49:28 <danayo> Justin_o:  what do we do now for emphasize buttons
2017-02-09T19:49:29 <danayo> ?
2017-02-09T19:49:50 <danayo> I guess now it\'s "enlarge buttons"
2017-02-09T19:50:17 <danayo> but I see in UIO now, nothing in the panel itself changes
2017-02-09T19:50:26 <danayo> e.g. the toggles don\'t get bigger
2017-02-09T19:50:30 <danayo> or the contrast buttons
2017-02-09T19:51:06 <danayo> etc
2017-02-09T19:53:23 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, makes things bigger
2017-02-09T19:53:41 <Justin_o> but it doesn\'t always work on everything.. i\'ll have to see how it\'s trying to affect things
2017-02-09T19:55:25 <Justin_o> danayo: it looks like it sets the font-size to be larger
2017-02-09T19:56:01 <danayo> oh I see that now Justin_o - in the show/hide tab
2017-02-09T19:56:13 <danayo> and search field
2017-02-09T19:56:18 <Justin_o> danayo: and that\'s only being applied to "input" and "button" elements.. so it could be missed on those ones because of that
2017-02-09T19:56:48 <danayo> ok Justin_o - yeah, it seems to me the checkboxes should get bigger too
2017-02-09T19:56:56 <danayo> as an "input"
2017-02-09T19:57:28 <danayo> I was just trying to decide what should happen to the new on/off toggles when "enhance inputs" is turned on
2017-02-09T19:57:35 <Justin_o> danayo: so the current toggles are spans inside of a label i believe
2017-02-09T19:57:49 <Justin_o> which is probably why they aren\'t being affected.. i\'ll try to address that when i update the design
2017-02-09T19:58:03 <Justin_o> danayo: i agree that they should increase in size
2017-02-09T20:00:24 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-02-09T20:01:34 <danayo> great Justin_o
2017-02-09T20:03:28 <danayo> Justin_o: right now we\'re calling it "emphasize links and buttons" - I was wondering if we should emphaize them in other ways - e.g. heavier borders, bold text etc, but maybe limiting it to size is best for consistency etc
2017-02-09T20:03:44 <danayo> or at least we could start with that ?
2017-02-09T20:03:50 <danayo> size, I mean
2017-02-09T20:06:25 <Justin_o> danayo: hmm.. that\'s a good question.. for links i think we also add an underline
2017-02-09T20:06:34 <Justin_o> but the contrast theme does that as well i think.
2017-02-09T20:07:52 <Justin_o> danayo: regarding borders, sometimes changing the border on the textfield will make it look less like a textfield.. so there are probably somethings to be careful of.. but there may be additional ways, as you say, of emphasizing that isn\'t just about size
2017-02-09T20:08:33 <Justin_o> danayo: another issue is how we address things that are used as buttons or inputs ( like the toggles ) but aren\'t using input or button elements underneath
2017-02-09T20:09:15 <Justin_o> that\'s an implementation detail to some degree, but it means that we can\'t always guarantee that something is going to be styled properly
2017-02-09T20:11:26 * clown joined the channel
2017-02-09T20:13:03 <danayo> good point about the text fields Justin_o, and sounds like it would be hard to consistently style things
2017-02-09T20:14:04 <danayo> I guess for the toggles, they will increase in size also when text size is increased
2017-02-09T20:14:20 <Justin_o> danayo: yah, it usually requires some design / dev work to fully integrate UIO into a site. We just can\'t catch everything, but we can try to do as much as possible.
2017-02-09T20:14:29 <danayo> for sure Justin_o
2017-02-09T20:14:39 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, that should happen. Pretty much everything is sized to rems which is based on the root font size
2017-02-09T20:15:01 <danayo> ok Justin_o. do you  know what % increase we\'re currently using for enlarge buttons and other inputs?
2017-02-09T20:15:17 <danayo> and that would happen on top of any text size increase, right?
2017-02-09T20:16:32 <Justin_o> danayo: these are the styles for enhancing the links and inputs
2017-02-09T20:16:33 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/css/stylus/Enactors.styl#L28-L39
2017-02-09T20:16:44 <Justin_o> so you can see that font-size is set to 125%
2017-02-09T20:17:07 <danayo> ah ok Justin_o, it\'s controlled by the font size
2017-02-09T20:17:18 <danayo> and button text becomes bold too, right?
2017-02-09T20:17:34 <Justin_o> danayo: yep, and i\'d imagine that is based off the root font-size which we set when we do the text-size adjustments
2017-02-09T20:17:53 <Justin_o> danayo: that looks like it\'s just for links
2017-02-09T20:18:17 <Justin_o> buttons just get larger
2017-02-09T20:18:23 <danayo> ah right , they\'re not lumped together currently
2017-02-09T20:18:44 <danayo> oh  wait
2017-02-09T20:18:51 <danayo> you mean, bold text applies to links only
2017-02-09T20:18:52 <danayo> ?
2017-02-09T20:19:05 <danayo> but button text is increased by 125%?
2017-02-09T20:22:25 <danayo> ah I see Justin_o - the "enlarge text" link options
2017-02-09T20:23:27 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'m not sure why the comment for that says "link options", it\'s a bit confusing, maybe it was based on the panel name
2017-02-09T20:23:56 <danayo> yeah maybe

2017-02-09T20:48:24 <Justin_o> danayo: so yes and eventually.. :)
2017-02-09T20:48:43 <Justin_o> danayo: unfortunately i don\'t have access to the recordings from home, i think i have to be in the office to get to them.. I plan to be in the office on monday
2017-02-09T20:48:51 <Justin_o> and will add a link to the wiki at that point
2017-02-09T20:48:57 <Justin_o> will that be too late?
2017-02-09T20:49:23 <danayo> ok thanks Justin_o  - that\'s find - i had invited a couple of people who couldn\'t make it and who are interested in the recording - but no rush
2017-02-09T20:49:27 <danayo> *fine
2017-02-09T20:51:53 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks.. glad to see so many people are interested :)
