2017-03-01T14:23:06 <Jess__> can someone help me try something?
2017-03-01T14:23:17 <Jess__> i can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca to work as a hyperlink in word
2017-03-01T14:23:27 <Jess__> can anyone try it out and see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?
2017-03-01T14:44:29 <jhung> sure Jess__
2017-03-01T14:44:37 <jhung> which word are you using?
2017-03-01T14:52:49 * alanharnum has quit
2017-03-01T14:52:55 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-03-01T14:54:30 <jhung> Jess__: it works for me using Word Office 365. It\'s a bit odd because after inserting the link the text just looks blue.
2017-03-01T14:54:41 <jhung> But if you right-click it, you can see that it is a link.
2017-03-01T14:54:52 <Jess__> gah, mine won\xe2\x80\x99t work properly\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-03-01T14:55:58 <jhung> Wanna Vidyo Jess__?
2017-03-01T14:58:42 <Jess__> sure

2017-03-01T15:22:29 <alanharnum> Hi danayo, I don\'t know if you saw JT\'s email yet, but her presentations got moved to today at 1:30 and 3:30 - I\'ve got the site deployed but can we touch base quickly when you\'ve got a chance about a few things we might want to tweak this morning?
2017-03-01T15:22:45 <danayo> I was just emailing you exactly the same alanharnum!
2017-03-01T15:22:46 <danayo> yes
2017-03-01T15:22:51 <danayo> let\'s talk
2017-03-01T15:23:05 <danayo> I feel badly that I convinced you to a Thursday deadline alanharnum!!
2017-03-01T15:23:28 <danayo> give me 5 minutes alanharnum!
2017-03-01T15:23:31 <danayo> ?
2017-03-01T15:23:36 <danayo> *?
2017-03-01T15:23:42 <alanharnum> danayo: sure - i\'ll open my room
2017-03-01T15:23:46 <danayo> great

2017-03-01T16:08:55 <danayo> thanks alanharnum
2017-03-01T16:09:50 <danayo> by the way alanharnum, I love sojustrepairit !
2017-03-01T16:11:31 * avtar joined the channel
2017-03-01T16:25:13 <danayo> alanharnum: I\'m thinking it would be best for the "Join Us" section on the SJRK wiki to add the info in the "Get in Touch with Us" panel here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved - what do you think?
2017-03-01T16:25:32 <alanharnum> danayo: sounds good to me
2017-03-01T16:26:01 <alanharnum> later perhaps we\'ll want some specific content related to SJRK but for now I think that\'s good
2017-03-01T16:32:42 <Jess__> jhung: doh, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be printed, so no matter
2017-03-01T16:34:07 <danayo> ok alanharnum, i\'ve added it: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit
2017-03-01T16:34:25 <danayo> I agree it would be good to have a project-specific email
2017-03-01T16:35:06 <jhung> Jess__: Ok. I guess that\'s good news.  I still wonder why this particular link was a problem though.
2017-03-01T16:37:50 <Jess__> jhung: i will investigate further as soon as this is in
2017-03-01T16:49:57 <Jess__> jhung: it was john willis \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x98other john\xe2\x80\x9d
2017-03-01T17:04:51 <michelled> Jess__: if the proposal is going in today, when will we hear about whether we got it?
2017-03-01T17:06:37 <alanharnum> danayo: great, updated link
2017-03-01T17:08:28 <Jess__> michelled: it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say specifically, but it would have to be a fast turn-around
2017-03-01T17:09:21 <michelled> yes, with the first deliverable due March 17th
2017-03-01T17:21:33 <danayo> alanharnum: it\'s looking great. noticed in firefox that the black blob is covering up some of the upper text in the white space
2017-03-01T17:21:45 <danayo> (looks great in chrome and safari tho)
2017-03-01T17:22:18 <danayo> seems to be true at any window size
2017-03-01T17:22:33 <alanharnum> danayo: hm, I don\'t see that problem in FF myself, can we vidyo quickly and screen share?
2017-03-01T17:23:12 <danayo> sure one sec alanharnum
2017-03-01T17:23:27 <alanharnum> danayo: my room is open when you\'re ready
2017-03-01T17:27:55 <jhung> colinclark: is the Sonification Toolkit meeting at 12:30p today? or is it 1pm? I can never remember the time that was settled upon.
2017-03-01T17:34:35 <jhung> looks like the meeting is 1pm. I waited in the Zoom room for a while and no one showed. I\'ll update the calendar.
2017-03-01T17:36:55 <alanharnum> could anyone with a few spare minutes look at http://repairkit.idrc.ocadu.ca/ in their browsers and let me know if anything looks graphically untoward?
2017-03-01T17:37:12 <alanharnum> images overlapping text, etc
2017-03-01T17:37:51 <Jess__> alanharnum: \xe2\x80\x98learn and \xe2\x80\x98join are meant to be touching and leaning on the white around the collab image?
2017-03-01T17:37:59 <alanharnum> Jess__: yup
2017-03-01T17:38:14 <alanharnum> overlapping to the extent of unreadability, etc
2017-03-01T17:38:39 <Jess__> alanharnum: it looks great to me
2017-03-01T17:38:56 <alanharnum> Jess__ could you check it in Firefox if you\'re using something else?
2017-03-01T17:39:17 <alanharnum> We\'re seeing some issues in danayo\'s Firefox and not mine
2017-03-01T17:39:29 <alanharnum> you get to be the "who has cached CSS" tiebreaker!
2017-03-01T17:39:45 <Jess__> alanharnum: looks great in ff
2017-03-01T17:40:07 <Jess__> and chrome too
2017-03-01T17:43:11 <alanharnum> yay, thanks Jess__
2017-03-01T17:52:44 <colinclark> jhung: Sorry, just saw this now\xe2\x80\x94yup, I think they rescheduled to 1 pm
2017-03-01T17:52:51 <colinclark> every week
2017-03-01T17:53:38 <jhung> colinclark: Yeah. I\'ve updated the calendar events.

2017-03-01T18:36:27 <danayo> alanharnum, Jess__, what do you think of this wiki page? I\'m also creating a Word doc template that our partners can fill in if they would rather do that - and then we can enter the info here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Initiatives+and+Resources+Engaging+Youth+with+Learning+Differences
2017-03-01T18:36:53 <danayo> I wasn\'t entirely sure about organising it all under each partner\'s name, but I think we\'ll need to keep track
2017-03-01T18:37:24 <danayo> so that we know who is going to contact/bring in who
2017-03-01T18:37:44 <danayo> also it will probably get quite big so maybe eventually we\'ll split it out
2017-03-01T18:38:22 <danayo> hoping to make it as easy/clear as possible for them to contribute
2017-03-01T18:41:06 <danayo> also alanharnum, Jess__: the list of partners came from what I wrote down during that last meeting with Jutta - want to make sure these are correct
2017-03-01T18:42:26 <Jess__> danayo: so, there are indeed 4 funded partners
2017-03-01T18:42:34 <Jess__> the others are also partners
2017-03-01T18:43:12 <danayo> right Jess__  -- so I understood this list longer to be "contributing partners" ?
2017-03-01T18:43:20 <danayo> is that right?
2017-03-01T18:43:21 <Jess__> yes
2017-03-01T18:43:30 <Jess__> i think we can call them all partners
