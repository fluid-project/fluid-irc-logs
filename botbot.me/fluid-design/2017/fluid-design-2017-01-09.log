2017-01-09T15:30:55 <Jess_> as we stretch more into mobile, perhaps we should look into this http://aem.cast.org/creating/cast-figuration.html#.WHOsfXeZPOY fluid-everyone
2017-01-09T15:31:08 <Jess_> if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t already
2017-01-09T15:33:37 <jhung> Jess_: Boris @ CAST let me know about this a while ago. I'd like to give it a try on an appropriate project. Maybe for a demo or exemplar.
2017-01-09T15:33:52 <Jess_> jhung: sounds like a very good idea
2017-01-09T15:34:21 <Jess_> i know we have some mobile coming up \xe2\x80\x94 it came up last week in conversation with Razorfish
2017-01-09T15:34:50 <jhung> Are they the ones working with CCL?
2017-01-09T15:35:50 <Jess_> no, they are the ones who might have resources to contribute to upcoming projects like Big Ideas
2017-01-09T15:36:04 <Jess_> they did some work with axmap
2017-01-09T15:36:07 <Jess_> axsmap
2017-01-09T15:36:26 <jhung> ok cool!
2017-01-09T15:36:40 <jhung> As an aside, choosing a flexible and accessible front-end framework seems like something we should document in the ILDH. We'd be able to highlight relevant work from CAST and Foundation.
2017-01-09T15:37:10 <Jess_> ah, i think that\xe2\x80\x99d be enormously helpful
2017-01-09T15:37:36 <Jess_> jhung: i wonder if anyone is already aggregating a list of those we could point to so we keep our admin overhead down?
2017-01-09T15:39:01 <jhung> Jess_: good point. I'll see if such a list exists. If I don't find anything maybe CAST has something.
