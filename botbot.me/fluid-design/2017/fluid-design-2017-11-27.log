2017-11-27T17:52:55 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum and  jhung I was wondering if you are able to add content to the DeveloperSpace. We need to add a blurb and a link to our privacy work.
2017-11-27T17:53:33 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I've definitely been able to in the past, let me see if what I've got still works
2017-11-27T17:58:08 <sepidehshahi> great, thanks alanharnum
2017-11-27T18:00:57 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: yup, looks like my account still works - do you want to just send me the blurb and link and I can do it quickly?
2017-11-27T18:01:25 <sepidehshahi> for sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have that ready in an hour and send it to you. Thanks a lot

2017-11-27T18:56:14 * mrtyler has quit
2017-11-27T19:01:22 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: OK, created at https://ds.gpii.net/learn/bibliography/floe-privacy-needs-and-preferences - let me know if anything needs changing
2017-11-27T19:02:07 <sepidehshahi> this is perfect! thanks alanharnum
2017-11-27T19:07:07 <jessm> sepidehshahi: i\xe2\x80\x99m just finally getting to the 404 TOC
2017-11-27T19:07:15 <jessm> is the Nov 23 version you sent me the latest?
2017-11-27T19:07:48 <sepidehshahi> great! I think so, I think I sent it either on Thursday or Friday
2017-11-27T19:08:07 <jessm> ok, great \xe2\x80\x94 sepidehshahi i think we should just send that TOC at the beginning to Doris
2017-11-27T19:08:12 <jessm> want to do that?
2017-11-27T19:08:31 <sepidehshahi> sure
2017-11-27T19:08:42 <jessm> sorry for the wait! sepid
2017-11-27T19:08:47 <jessm> oops, sepidehshahi
2017-11-27T19:09:04 <sepidehshahi> no worries, but does it make sense? is there anything missing?
2017-11-27T19:09:29 <sepidehshahi> jessm: ^
2017-11-27T19:09:33 <jessm> sepidehshahi: i don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. as we talked about this a.m. vivian\xe2\x80\x99s annex is contained in section 3
2017-11-27T19:09:54 <jessm> sepidehshahi: unless we want to write a small section updating the thinking on complex, adaptive systems?
2017-11-27T19:10:00 <jessm> maybe that\xe2\x80\x99d be useful
2017-11-27T19:10:54 <sepidehshahi> Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll add that and send just the TOC to Doris
2017-11-27T19:15:59 <jessm> sepidehshahi: thanks!

2017-11-27T19:18:17 <jhung> fluid-everyone: does anyone have a topic for tomorrow's design crit?
2017-11-27T19:19:34 <sepidehshahi> jhung: michelled suggested that we discuss the entry for learning difference so it will be ready for the guide
2017-11-27T19:21:13 <jhung> ok sepidehshahi, that sounds good. Can you send me a link to the draft?
2017-11-27T19:22:34 <sepidehshahi> sure, here is the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8V1yLR3Qga_LENFW8KZd3b-93ibNEKXQDQiWcWfaDk/edit?usp=sharing

2017-11-27T19:57:34 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: no bother, just saw email now - adding :)
2017-11-27T19:57:59 <sepidehshahi> you are the best! thanks
2017-11-27T19:58:37 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: https://ds.gpii.net/learn/bibliography/inclusive-design-guide
2017-11-27T19:58:57 <sepidehshahi> perfect! thx
2017-11-27T19:59:39 <grrrero> jhung: Did you get a chance to check out the wp-a11y changes?
2017-11-27T20:02:45 <jhung> grrrero:  not yet. I probably won't have time any time soon. Is this blocking you from other work (i.e. should I look at it sooner than later?)
2017-11-27T20:03:14 <grrrero> jhung: Well I was gonna include the changes to the SNOW theme, but I can hold off doing those changes and concentrate on other stuff if that works?
2017-11-27T20:03:25 <grrrero> *on other stuff in the SNOW theme
2017-11-27T20:04:29 <grrrero> I'm doing other parts of it right now anyway :)
2017-11-27T20:07:11 <jhung> ok grrrero. I'm thinking that I'm going to hold off that PR merge until this push on Big Idea is out the door. In the meantime since the changes are in your fork of wp-a11y, you can continue to work from that.
2017-11-27T20:15:47 <grrrero> Ok cool jhung thanks
