2017-11-21T18:09:23 <sepidehshahi> Just read the abstract, but it seems very cool. thanks colinclark
2017-11-21T18:09:38 <colinclark> yeah, i\'m just working my way through it
2017-11-21T18:09:43 <colinclark> it\'s rather Latourian
2017-11-21T18:10:03 <colinclark> but at least it\'s interesting to see other ideas
2017-11-21T18:11:36 <sepidehshahi> now I\xe2\x80\x99m searching for Latourian approaches :)
2017-11-21T18:11:47 <danayo> thanks colinclark
2017-11-21T18:12:45 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: This is a nice one, about a philosophy of design: http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/112-DESIGN-CORNWALL-GB.pdf
2017-11-21T18:14:00 <colinclark> pretty theoretical stuff
2017-11-21T18:14:42 <sepidehshahi> great! it\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting though. thanks

2017-11-21T19:43:36 <colinclark> hey simonjb, sepidehshahi, danayo, and others, I wonder if you have any suggestions for potential invitees to a workshop I\'m starting to plan, which I think we will call "Continuing Creativity"
2017-11-21T19:43:57 <colinclark> the idea of the workshop is to bring together software developer and computer scientists, designers, and artists
2017-11-21T19:44:34 <colinclark> who are working on tools and approaches for supporting creative engagement
2017-11-21T19:45:58 <colinclark> so people who might speak to a) software architectures for supporting "end user programming" or alternative forms of authorship b) designers who are employing co-design, participatory, or community-rooted design techniques and c) artists whose creative practices relate to the above
2017-11-21T19:47:02 <colinclark> and of course I\'m particularly interested in inclusion\xe2\x80\x94so people who come from the communities they work with, artists with disabilities, and so on
2017-11-21T19:48:08 <colinclark> and i\'m interested both in people who would give talks or present theoretical papers, as well as performances and/or exhibitions
2017-11-21T19:48:59 * danayo has quit
2017-11-21T19:50:26 <simonjb> sounds awesome colinclark, I will give some thought and make a list
2017-11-21T19:50:32 <colinclark> thanks
2017-11-21T19:58:02 <sepidehshahi> same here colinclark. do they have to be local or can we support remote participants?
2017-11-21T19:58:16 <colinclark> no, they can be from anywhere
2017-11-21T19:58:28 <colinclark> I\'m going to write a SSHRC Connection grant to support travel
2017-11-21T19:58:43 <sepidehshahi> great! I\xe2\x80\x99ll reach out to some people and let you know
2017-11-21T19:58:50 <colinclark> awesome, thank you!

2017-11-21T20:37:45 <gmoss> danayo: I didn\'t notice the link to the collaborative notes for the SJRK meeting until after the call had ended. I\'ve just finished merging in my notes
2017-11-21T20:38:00 <gmoss> there was considerable overlap, which made the task easy :)
2017-11-21T20:38:03 <danayo> thanks gmoss
2017-11-21T20:39:39 <gmoss> np! thanks for setting up the google doc, as usual :)
