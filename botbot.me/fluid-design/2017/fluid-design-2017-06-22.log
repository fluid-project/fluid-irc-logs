2017-06-22T14:15:42 <Jess__> jhung: pong
2017-06-22T14:16:36 <jhung> the changes to the workshops page is updated on the IDI site (see: http://inclusivedesign.ca/about/workshops/). But I looked on the Home page and there\'s a lot of empty space. Is that the expected result?
2017-06-22T14:17:08 <Jess__> jhung: woah, something broke
2017-06-22T14:17:25 <jhung> What was supposed to be there? Twitter stuff?
2017-06-22T14:17:25 <Jess__> there was at least one other column and then the twitter feeds
2017-06-22T14:17:28 <jhung> ah
2017-06-22T14:17:34 <jhung> ok. Let me see Jess__
2017-06-22T14:17:34 <Jess__> and i think the footer is gone too
2017-06-22T14:18:23 <Jess__> gtirloni: this reminds me\xe2\x80\xa6 jhung and i were mucking around with the deep website yesterday because the nav is kind of broken. I wonder if a recent update has mucked it up \xe2\x80\x94 can you have a quick peek? http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca
2017-06-22T14:18:42 <Jess__> gtirloni: we did some basic troubleshooting and recreated the nav to no avail
2017-06-22T14:19:07 <gtirloni> the inclusivedesign.ca website has the Twitter plugin turned off for some reason, I think that accounts for the empty space
2017-06-22T14:19:30 <jhung> ok Jess__ gtirloni I\'ll turn that back on
2017-06-22T14:20:43 <jhung> Jess__ gtirloni: hmmm. I enabled it and it didn\'t do anything. I\'ll do some digging.
2017-06-22T14:21:04 <gtirloni> Jess__: DEEP is not using a theme from a git repository, so there is no change history :(
2017-06-22T14:21:41 <danayo> colinclark and everyone: have you tried today\'s google doodle??
2017-06-22T14:23:04 <gtirloni> jhung: twitter error - "PHP message: PHP Fatal error:  Cannot redeclare class TwitterOAuth in wp-content/plugins/twitteroauth/twitteroauth/twitteroauth.php on line 15"
2017-06-22T14:26:46 <jhung> gtirloni: ok. I disabled the plugin because we\'re injecting the twitter feed manually via a a custom function.
2017-06-22T14:26:59 <jhung> gtirloni: but something else is going on.
2017-06-22T14:27:26 <colinclark> danayo: I\'ve always loved Oskar Fischinger
2017-06-22T14:27:30 <colinclark> this is great
2017-06-22T14:27:38 <danayo> yeah, super fun, i love it
2017-06-22T14:27:43 <danayo> the sounds are great
2017-06-22T14:27:52 <colinclark> though it strikes me as more Eno than Fischinger :)
2017-06-22T14:27:56 <danayo> ha
2017-06-22T14:28:04 <danayo> it\'s true!
2017-06-22T14:28:55 <gtirloni> jhung: could it be related to the other plugin that\'s enabled? "oAuth Twitter Feed for Developers"
2017-06-22T14:29:23 <gtirloni> jhung: i still get the php error even with "Twitter Feed: Embedded Timeline WordPress Plugin" disabled
2017-06-22T14:29:57 <gtirloni> jhung Jess__ : on the deep website, i noticed in chrome devtools that a bunch of JS scripts are not loaded from that Blaskan theme.. maybe it\'s messing things up

2017-06-22T14:32:06 <jhung> ok gtirloni. Re: idi site twitter feed. I\'m going to have to look into this some more when I have time.
2017-06-22T14:33:41 <Caren> danayo and colinclark and everyone: very fun google doodle. Makes me think of NodeBeat for smart phone\xe2\x80\xa6great fun: http://nodebeat.com/

2017-06-22T14:37:01 <gtirloni> jhung: re: deep, i don\'t see any files changed in the last 10 days.. maybe it wasn\'t a change to some css/php file but a configuration in the website (which would be reflected in the database)?
2017-06-22T14:37:07 <gtirloni> Jess__: ^^
2017-06-22T14:40:01 <jhung> gtirloni: thanks for looking into that. Do you know if any changes done to the PHP files through the WP theme admin interface are stored in the database (instead of modifying the files themselves)?
2017-06-22T14:40:24 <gtirloni> I think the changes done through the editor are made directly to the files
2017-06-22T14:40:54 <gtirloni> but the ones down through "customize" are probably stored in the database
2017-06-22T14:42:33 <jhung> gtirloni: ok. Thanks. This helps narrow down the possible areas of changes. I\'ll keep looking.

2017-06-22T15:17:05 <gtirloni> jhung: i\'m checking those 404 on the deep website, they look weird.. the files exist, i\'m checking what might be causing it
2017-06-22T15:17:37 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-06-22T15:17:40 <jhung> ok. Thanks gtirloni
2017-06-22T15:20:54 <gtirloni> jhung: wordpress is trying to load it from http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/wp-content/themes/blaskan/js/script.js
2017-06-22T15:21:03 <gtirloni> but it actually exists at http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/wp-content/themes/blaskan/assets/js/scripts.js
2017-06-22T15:21:19 <gtirloni> i see it loads it here:
2017-06-22T15:21:21 <gtirloni> blaskan/functions.php:\twp_enqueue_script( \'blaskan-scripts\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/assets/js/scripts.js\', array( \'jquery\' ), \'20151215\', true );
2017-06-22T15:21:30 <gtirloni> not sure why it\'s stripping "/assets"
2017-06-22T15:26:19 <gtirloni> maybe because it\'s a child theme (blaskan_custom) and it\'s building the final path from its root directory as opposite to the parent theme.. #whoknows
2017-06-22T15:27:11 <jhung> gtirloni: hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 what happens if we put an absolute path to the JS file instead for wp_enqueue_script? Does that work properly?
2017-06-22T15:30:49 * Jess__ has quit
2017-06-22T15:31:37 <gtirloni> i think it only works because we bypass index.php.. if we go directly to the file
2017-06-22T15:33:58 <gtirloni> did it look normal before yesterday? i remember it looked okay after the wp 4.8 upgrade, just wanted to confirm that wasn\'t the cause of this
2017-06-22T15:34:35 <gtirloni> these 404\'s might have been there forever.. i\'m afraid we might be looking at the wrong place, otherwise i\'d have seen the files were changed
2017-06-22T15:39:58 * mrtyler has quit
2017-06-22T15:54:23 <jhung> gtirloni: I don\'t recall how it looked unfortunately. I was looking at a sub page before this update.
2017-06-22T15:55:14 <jhung> gtirloni: sorry. I\'m mixing up my sites now (I was thinking about the IDI site).
2017-06-22T15:56:45 <jhung> gtirloni: unfortunately I didn\'t look at the site after the 4.8 update. I\'ve only seen what is there now and what was there before the update (via Way Back Machine).
2017-06-22T15:58:55 <gtirloni> looks like it was trying to load the scripts.js file from the incorrect URL before the upgrade, probably getting a 404 too
2017-06-22T15:59:10 <gtirloni> doesn\'t look like that\'s the culprit, i think
2017-06-22T16:00:01 <gtirloni> do you see anything here that could have any impact on the menu? http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/wp-content/themes/blaskan/assets/js/scripts.js
2017-06-22T16:09:14 <jhung> gtirloni: I don\'t think so. I think that script handles the scrolling and content for mobile (infinite scroll?)
2017-06-22T16:30:54 <jhung> Caren: do you have time to meet re: PhET? I\'d like to keep it short if possible today.
2017-06-22T16:31:10 <Caren> yes, sure. short is good.
2017-06-22T16:31:49 <Caren> your room?
2017-06-22T16:32:31 <jhung> Sure give me a sec.
2017-06-22T16:33:02 <jhung> ready Caren
2017-06-22T16:33:47 <Caren> your room is saying Locked jhung
2017-06-22T16:33:58 <jhung> Should be open
