2017-03-29T20:27:20 <jessm> i like her description of bass as thick

2017-03-29T20:32:23 <Justin_o> jessm: thanks for sharing, i had seen the jimmy kimmel bit before, which blew me away. It's great to have the detailed explanation of how they are signing the music.
2017-03-29T20:33:08 <jessm> if you all want to see her do more \xe2\x80\x94 she has a youtube channel \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how she can really capture so many different types of music with her body, with the signs \xe2\x80\x94 everything
2017-03-29T20:33:11 <jessm> impresive
2017-03-29T20:33:57 <Justin_o> I appreciate that they are attempting to capture the emotion of the performance too
