2017-01-13T14:08:22 <jhung> Jess__: Do we have a link to any of the current videos featuring the IDRC? I've tried looking for them but couldn't find them on our site.
2017-01-13T14:08:43 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-01-13T14:08:49 <Jess__> jhung: OMG, you\xe2\x80\x99re totally ruining my day ;) they should be in owncloud too, no?
2017-01-13T14:09:07 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-01-13T14:09:19 <Jess__> jhung: IDRC-specific\xe2\x80\xa6 there are some in youtube. hold on i\xe2\x80\x99ll find them
2017-01-13T14:09:57 <jhung> Jess__: ok. I'm asking because of the Oak Partner template JT sent around. Better to have that template link to some videos not on our owncloud.
2017-01-13T14:10:17 <Jess__> why do you say?
2017-01-13T14:11:13 <Jess__> jhung: well, tehre\xe2\x80\x99s the Microsoft video, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we want to link to them \xe2\x80\x94 though that can be under the \xe2\x80\x9cinspiration\xe2\x80\x9d resources part...
2017-01-13T14:11:19 <jhung> Jess__ I'm afraid one of us might move it accidentally and the link from Oak would break.
2017-01-13T14:11:30 <Jess__> jhung: good point
2017-01-13T14:12:38 <Jess__> jhung let me try to get a list together from our annual lab reports...
2017-01-13T14:14:45 <Jess__> jhung: i imagine this useful for the new website coming up...
2017-01-13T14:27:26 <colinclark> hey jhung, quick question for you
2017-01-13T14:27:50 <colinclark> what do you think is the best link to send Brianna from Bruce's lab, which shows off the work we've being doing to make the PhET sims more accessible?

2017-01-13T14:29:45 <colinclark> no rush

2017-01-13T14:33:35 * simonjb has quit
2017-01-13T14:42:58 <jhung> colinclark:  probably the documentation on the wiki is best. If you prefer, I can reply to that thread with the links and a quick description of what's there.
2017-01-13T14:44:32 <colinclark> I've got an email assembled with a number of IDRC-related links for her
2017-01-13T14:44:47 <colinclark> just wanted to include something that showed what you're doing with the sims
2017-01-13T14:45:01 <jhung> ok. let me grab you a link
2017-01-13T14:45:23 <colinclark> thanks!
2017-01-13T14:45:25 <jhung> colinclark: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Inclusivity+and+Accessibility+of+Interactive+Web+Games+and+Simulations
2017-01-13T14:45:36 <colinclark> that's PERFECT! :)
2017-01-13T14:46:52 <jhung> awesome. Let me know if there's anything else.
2017-01-13T14:47:57 <jhung> Jess__: I had a brain lapse\xe2\x80\xa6. I didn't realize that I was looking at an old email JT sent a week ago re: Oak Partner webpage template. I think that has been dealt with. So no rush on finding those links.
2017-01-13T14:48:21 <Jess__> jhung: she\xe2\x80\x99s actually pinging me about it now so it is quite apropos
2017-01-13T14:48:31 <jhung> Oh really! :)
2017-01-13T14:49:06 <jhung> In that case, the link they proposed in the template to the IDRC Online section under the Resources / Media should probably be changed / removed. That content is quite dated.
2017-01-13T14:49:09 <jhung> ^Jess__
2017-01-13T14:50:05 <Jess__> jhung: yep, we\xe2\x80\x99re on it \xe2\x80\x94 thanks jhung! i\xe2\x80\x99ve already got two pages of video links...
2017-01-13T14:56:13 <jhung> Nice. Is that document shared / stored somewhere Jess__? I imagine that'd be useful.
2017-01-13T15:03:09 <Jess__> jhung: i just created it and it needs major editing \xe2\x80\x94 i threw it together quickly. will fix it up and then wiki-fy it. as you could have imagined i got 1/2 way through and realized putting metadata like length of vid would be helpful. then there were two that were translated\xe2\x80\xa6 metadata\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-01-13T15:06:03 <jhung> Justin_o and I were just talking about this yesterday\xe2\x80\xa6 the issue of managing media. We started to talk about asset management systems again, but I think we'll need something that's built on top of OwnCloud so we can have local copies of the media.

2017-01-13T19:25:12 <Jess__> jhung: i came across a video with bubbles that is an animation of the IDI logo \xe2\x80\x94 and now I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it. i think it might have been your video \xe2\x80\x94 any idea where i can find it?
2017-01-13T19:27:33 <jhung> Jess__: I don't think that was one of mine, but I'll try to see if I can find it though.
2017-01-13T19:27:53 <Jess__> jhung: oh well. perhaps i was hoping. I can continue to dig...
2017-01-13T19:27:57 <Jess__> it isn\xe2\x80\x99t urgent
2017-01-13T19:28:43 <jhung> I think I found it Jess__
2017-01-13T19:29:01 <Jess__> :) me too!
2017-01-13T19:29:09 <Jess__> jhung:  here? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/IDRC-Design/Visual%20Resources/Logos/Finals/IDI&fileid=8428
2017-01-13T19:29:42 <jhung> Yep. That's the one Jess__
2017-01-13T19:29:53 <Jess__> thanks jhung !
2017-01-13T19:30:05 <jhung> np
2017-01-13T19:30:07 <Jess__> it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice vid. just wish it was a little speedier
2017-01-13T19:31:26 <jhung> Yeah. Do we have the original project somewhere? Maybe we can re-export it.
2017-01-13T19:31:43 <Jess__> jhung: i have no idea \xe2\x80\x94 i don\xe2\x80\x99t even know who did it

2017-01-13T20:51:32 <Jess__> can you or someone else fix it?
2017-01-13T20:51:52 <jhung> No worries Jess__ I can take a look.
2017-01-13T20:52:12 <Jess__> first discovery tool link
2017-01-13T20:52:50 <jhung> Ah. I see. Can't connect to it.
2017-01-13T20:53:05 <jhung> Was that link supposed to work?
2017-01-13T20:53:38 <Jess__> jhung i dunno. it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite look right to me
2017-01-13T20:55:48 <jhung> Ok. I'll do some digging. I think that link should have worked, so we may have shut down the service Jess__. cindyli or alanharn_ do either of you know anything about the first discovery prefs server demo?
2017-01-13T20:56:32 <Jess__> jhung: i just did a quick broken link search on that page and it showed up a few others \xe2\x80\x94 i don\xe2\x80\x99t see them as broken. Is there a checker for links that you use?
2017-01-13T20:56:51 <alanharn_> Jess__ jhung: let me look into it - it may be the service is down
2017-01-13T20:57:13 <jhung> I use the w3c link checker Jess__. https://validator.w3.org/checklink
2017-01-13T20:57:21 <Jess__> alanharn_: for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth i found this broken link yesterday
2017-01-13T20:57:29 <Jess__> jhung: thanks!
2017-01-13T21:22:58 <alanharn_> Jess__ jhung: looks like there was something odd going on with the Docker host on the demo server, I restarted the daemon and it seems fine now
2017-01-13T21:23:13 <Jess__> nice \xe2\x80\x94 thanks alanharn_
2017-01-13T21:23:29 <alanharn_> i am thankful a daemon restart fixed it, because that's the extent of what i want to do involving infrastructure on Friday afternoon :)
