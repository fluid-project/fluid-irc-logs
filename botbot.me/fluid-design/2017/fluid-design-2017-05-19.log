2017-05-19T13:55:27 <Caren> morning colinclark: do you know if all the video from the May 4 CaT (Create-a-Thon) has been downloaded?
2017-05-19T13:55:37 <colinclark> morning!
2017-05-19T13:55:43 <colinclark> i have video on two cards in my backpack
2017-05-19T13:55:51 <colinclark> i am hoping to transfer them this afternoon
2017-05-19T13:56:21 <colinclark> my camera requires a bit of "post" to make the footage look good, but i\'ll try to just share a bunch of raw clips
2017-05-19T13:56:32 <colinclark> and if any of them are any good, you can tell me and i\'ll colour grade them
2017-05-19T13:58:49 <Caren> awesome, thanks so much. Not too concerned about aesthetics being top notch at this point. Would love to scan through the content!
2017-05-19T13:58:55 <colinclark> yes, totally
2017-05-19T13:58:58 <colinclark> i hope the audio was ok
2017-05-19T13:59:06 <colinclark> but we\'ll see :)
2017-05-19T13:59:38 <colinclark> what are you working on so far, with all the material we captured from the event, Caren?
2017-05-19T14:06:38 <Caren> I extracted the written and drawn content into a Sheet with the intention of understanding each participants thinking. Reviewing the actual artefacts created, reviewing video we have uploaded and taking notes. This morning I started to consider the intersection of Skate Park with the CaT participant design. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QS3l_X_p_Nz4dXmQJQ_tgsFsnkJdcp6MvZ4tWM-JFT0/edit#gid=0
2017-05-19T14:09:33 <Caren> I have hand written notes of ideas on a print out of the Sheets doc\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-05-19T14:10:33 <Caren> colinclark: perhaps a vidyo chat? PhET meeting is at 11 est.
2017-05-19T14:10:34 <colinclark> cool
2017-05-19T14:10:54 <colinclark> I\'m in the SJRK meeting with partners right now
2017-05-19T14:11:00 <colinclark> and then phet sonification at 12:30
2017-05-19T14:11:05 <colinclark> and then interviews this afternoon :)
2017-05-19T14:11:40 <Caren> Ok\xe2\x80\xa6busy! got some good thoughts on how to position my approach and thinking from michelled yesterday.
2017-05-19T14:11:48 <colinclark> do we still have the notes and sketches that each participant made as part of the activities?
2017-05-19T14:12:05 <colinclark> some of those sketches, and the narrative that they described them with were very interesting, I think
2017-05-19T14:12:13 <colinclark> ah cool
2017-05-19T14:12:19 <colinclark> what did michelled say?
2017-05-19T14:13:01 <Caren> Yes, original notes and sketches as well as snaps of those in ownCloud
2017-05-19T14:16:25 <Caren> consider the unique and not the patterns\xe2\x80\xa6I was being drawn to patterns that were emerging. Also directed me to MyL3 narrative as a way of documenting.
2017-05-19T14:17:29 <Caren> colinclark: link to post event page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Create-A-Thon+Post+Event+Notes
2017-05-19T14:18:00 <colinclark> Well, patterns are good too :)
2017-05-19T14:18:28 <colinclark> we should of course consider both patterns and differences :)
2017-05-19T14:21:55 <Caren> ok, that makes sense.
2017-05-19T14:25:10 <Caren> michelle, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that is what you meant! don\xe2\x80\x99t forget about the unique :-)
2017-05-19T14:25:31 <Caren> ^michelled
2017-05-19T14:25:54 <michelled> Caren: yes, exactly :) our very complex and super interesting task of considering everyone
2017-05-19T14:26:21 <michelled> individuals and their/our experiences
2017-05-19T14:31:47 <Caren> yes, yes! awesomeness.
2017-05-19T14:32:43 <colinclark> I guess probably the point you were also making, michelled, is that most of the traditional design synthesis methods (I\'m thinking, for example, of Karen Holtzblatt\'s context inquiry methods, which I made reference to yesterday here) are really about finding common requirements, perhaps at the expense of the unique and idiosyncratic needs that might at actually produce something unexpected in the design process. :)
2017-05-19T14:33:30 <michelled> yes, but you\'ve phrased it much better colinclark :)
2017-05-19T14:34:14 <michelled> I suppose it boils down to Jutta\'s the value of the unpopular, the edges etc.
2017-05-19T14:41:58 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-05-19T14:43:38 <Caren> colinclark and michelled: You\xe2\x80\x99ve both made it clear and helped unstick some processes for me. So thanks :-)
2017-05-19T14:44:25 <michelled> :)
2017-05-19T15:04:37 <colinclark> brilliantly facilitated, danayo
2017-05-19T15:04:39 <colinclark> nice work!
2017-05-19T15:04:57 <danayo> thanks colinclark :)
2017-05-19T15:07:30 <colinclark> I\'m very excited about the opportunities for building storytelling tools and resources
2017-05-19T15:07:59 <colinclark> and then in being able to also use them as part of our own design approaches
2017-05-19T15:08:39 <colinclark> for example, there\'s the great connection with Caren\'s current work sifting through a lot of audio and video to better understand some of the stories that emerged from the create-a-thon the other week
2017-05-19T15:08:57 <danayo> me too colinclark, listening to all the partners it really struck me how useful that could be
2017-05-19T15:09:19 <colinclark> yes totally
2017-05-19T15:09:39 <colinclark> and the connection with Juliana\'s work with participatory and artist radio
2017-05-19T15:09:41 <colinclark> so interesting
2017-05-19T15:09:57 <danayo> yes. i love that project. that site is so beautiful
2017-05-19T15:10:51 <colinclark> it\'s gorgeous, yes
2017-05-19T15:10:56 <alanharnum> yeah, brilliant faciliation by danayo - and really excited about the possibility of building inclusive tools for storytelling, recording, etc
2017-05-19T15:11:20 <alanharnum> i think working on that could have such great applications both for this project and more widely
2017-05-19T15:12:54 <danayo> :) :) :)
2017-05-19T15:33:40 <danayo> and thanks for all your input/comments/thoughts colinclark, jessm, alanharnum
2017-05-19T15:33:47 <danayo> and for notetaking too jessm !
2017-05-19T15:33:56 <colinclark> any time, danayo

2017-05-19T20:36:28 <Caren> danayo and everyone: what app do you use to take a poll for a potential meeting time?
2017-05-19T20:36:56 <danayo> Caren: I\'ve been using Doodle.
2017-05-19T20:37:28 <Caren> danayo: this one http://doodle.com/ ?
2017-05-19T20:37:42 <danayo> yup
2017-05-19T20:39:12 <Caren> ok, thanks danayo!
2017-05-19T20:40:59 <danayo> np
2017-05-19T20:41:23 <danayo> Caren: just remember to select "use time zone" if you have folks in different zones
2017-05-19T20:41:43 <danayo> i learned the hard way :)
2017-05-19T20:41:57 <Caren> oy! thanks for the tip :-)
