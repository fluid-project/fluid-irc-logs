2017-10-31T13:37:13 <simonjb> I think that Boxer is quite interesting in its use of visual containment for structure
2017-10-31T13:37:41 <simonjb> I will continue to add resources as I think of and find them
2017-10-31T13:38:14 <sepidehshahi> ggreat! I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into them

2017-10-31T15:32:36 <lliskovoi> sounds good to me danayo
2017-10-31T15:32:39 <sepidehshahi> sure, danayo, I have stopped almost a week ago, so I could only record for three weeks.
2017-10-31T15:33:38 <lliskovoi> we could discuss it at next week\'s design crit if that gives everyone enough time

2017-10-31T18:26:22 <michelled> alanharnum, gmoss, danayo: you might find this interesting: https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/migrants.html take a look at the bottom \'voices of migrant workers\'
2017-10-31T18:26:25 <gmoss> it amuses me how strongly some of the residents there are opposed to the statue, and what their priorities are
2017-10-31T18:26:37 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-10-31T18:28:13 <gmoss> michelled: a very powerful example of audio being used to tell stories! this is great
2017-10-31T18:28:37 <gmoss> (the stories are decidedly not great)
2017-10-31T18:28:49 <michelled> indeed
2017-10-31T18:29:04 <michelled> not surprising, but it really does make a difference to hear it from the workers themselves
2017-10-31T18:29:11 <danayo> thanks michelled: i find the photo + audio so powerful and simple
2017-10-31T18:29:24 <michelled> with the one quote pulled out too
2017-10-31T18:29:25 <danayo> it really does make a difference to hear it directly, i agree
2017-10-31T18:29:26 * alanharnum has quit
2017-10-31T18:29:29 <danayo> yes
2017-10-31T18:32:27 <gmoss> danayo: I see the quote as similar to what our summary would be in the storytelling tool. I think it would be better for accessibility if the entire transcription were available, but this is indeed a very effective presentation
2017-10-31T18:36:08 <danayo> gmoss: yeah - I guess it plays the same role in a way as a distillation of the main ideas - it also makes me think about the difference between a first-person telling like this, and the possiblity that a story may be told in 3rd person or otherwise

2017-10-31T18:52:36 <mrtyler> gmoss: lol there are THREE MORE COW STORIES linked from that one!
2017-10-31T18:56:59 <mrtyler> gmoss: a friend responded with this article: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/grazing-rights/
2017-10-31T18:57:16 <mrtyler> which contains this incredible line: The band Udderly Tuba took part in the event
2017-10-31T18:57:36 <mrtyler> my favorite line from the new article you posted: Imagine your child trying to sleep, and outside his window, at eye level, is a large chrome cow. It even gives me anxiety, let alone a child.

2017-10-31T20:07:25 <clown> that came up in out design crit this morning about how to engage people in civic planning.
2017-10-31T20:07:34 <clown> the cow was an example of how to not do that.
