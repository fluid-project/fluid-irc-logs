2017-02-23T14:48:53 <jhung> Justin_o: that\'s pretty good. Although I would probably use a different word than "look". Perhaps says something like "collaboratively examine and discuss\xe2\x80\xa6"
2017-02-23T14:49:22 <jhung> Justin_o: I see the wiki page uses the word "look" as well. I\'ll tweak that.

2017-02-23T15:07:15 <danayo> hi alanhar__ alanharnum, was just about to ping you - we didn\'t discuss it, but I think it\'s important. Do you have some time to check in?
2017-02-23T15:07:51 <alanharnum> danayo: sure - when is good for you?

2017-02-23T17:09:22 <Justin_o> clown: do you  know if it\'s acceptable to use the switch role ( https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#switch ) on a button
2017-02-23T17:09:24 <Justin_o> ?
2017-02-23T17:10:05 <Justin_o> we\'re trying to decide how best to semantically represent the on/off toggles
2017-02-23T17:17:45 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: do you have a github account?
2017-02-23T17:20:49 <danayo> alanhar__ alanharnum I\'m putting the assets here: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/NuDSHT4zYaCDBO2
2017-02-23T17:20:58 <alanharnum> danayo: awesome, thanks danayo
2017-02-23T17:21:22 <danayo> let me know if you need them in different format / size etc - I\'ll keep adding to them
2017-02-23T17:21:59 <danayo> alanharnum ^
2017-02-23T17:22:23 <danayo> I\'m going to try to find an alternative background image now
2017-02-23T17:22:36 <danayo> oh, and get you the icon credits
2017-02-23T17:22:42 <alanharnum> danayo: if you look at https://rawgit.com/waharnum/repairKit-site/master/index.html you can see some initial responsive behaviour
2017-02-23T17:22:54 <alanharnum> it\'s pretty crude ATM, as are my placeholder graphics
2017-02-23T17:23:17 <danayo> great alanharnum!
2017-02-23T17:23:59 <danayo> I wonder - if those black diagonals should move with the "This site is under co-design" text
2017-02-23T17:24:08 <danayo> might break it up too much
2017-02-23T17:24:37 <clown> Justin_o:  re:  using switch role on a button:  it\'s really for a dual-state control, like a checkbox.  However, \xe2\x80\xa6
2017-02-23T17:25:03 <clown> A toggle button is dual state, so calling it a switch is probably okay, if a stretch.
2017-02-23T17:25:20 <clown> But, more important, what is the UX for the widget?
2017-02-23T17:25:31 <clown> If the UX is the same as a swtich, then it\'s a switch.
2017-02-23T17:29:04 <Justin_o> clown: if you look at the images under "learner options mobile enhance buttons high contrast" on this page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+%28Learner%29+Options+Mobile+and+Responsive+Design
2017-02-23T17:30:22 * clown looks
2017-02-23T17:31:09 <clown> Okay, I\'ve seen nothing like it \xe2\x80\x94 it does not match anything in my personal user experience.
2017-02-23T17:31:17 <clown> My first thought is, "what are these things?"
2017-02-23T17:31:44 <Justin_o> clown: :) inovation
2017-02-23T17:32:37 <clown> So:  they don\'t feel like checkboxes, not like toggle buttons, nor like switches.
2017-02-23T17:33:26 <clown> well, slightly like switches in that they have "on" and "off" in the UI (as to switches).
2017-02-23T17:33:38 <Justin_o> clown: what do they feel like for you?
2017-02-23T17:33:44 * colinclark has quit
2017-02-23T17:34:08 <clown> I repeat:  "it does not match anything in my personal user experience"
2017-02-23T17:34:37 <Justin_o> clown: okay, so you\'d lean towards switch though
2017-02-23T17:34:44 <clown> I imagine I could get a feel for them if I used them \xe2\x80\x94 I assume that "clicking" them changes from "on" to "off" and vice versa?
2017-02-23T17:35:22 <clown> oh, but there is also a check mark, so they kind of feel like check boxes in that regard.
2017-02-23T17:35:37 <Justin_o> yes to the clicking them
2017-02-23T17:35:41 <clown> you know, it\'s almost as if the widgets aren\'t sure of what they are.
2017-02-23T17:35:42 <clown> :-)
2017-02-23T17:35:43 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-02-23T17:36:22 <Justin_o> :)
2017-02-23T17:36:42 <clown> does the rectantgle that surrounds the current state slide (animate) when clicked?
2017-02-23T17:36:44 <Justin_o> so they have the checks and the on/off text to make things very explicit about which is currently selected
2017-02-23T17:36:58 <Justin_o> clown: no, it doesn\'t animate, it just flips sides

2017-02-23T18:00:03 <danayo> would be great to do some usability testing with them
2017-02-23T18:00:08 <danayo> if we could
2017-02-23T18:01:44 <Justin_o> danayo: i just chatted with him about them a bit.. he\'s off to a meeting now though.. did you want to do a quick vidyo chat for me to update you about it
2017-02-23T18:02:22 <danayo> alanhar__, alanharnum: and here\'s the IDRC logo https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/IDRC+logo
