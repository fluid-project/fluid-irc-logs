2017-01-31T19:36:27 <simonjb> jessm: that's pretty interesting

2017-01-31T19:50:58 <jessm> gtirloni: Justin_o: does either of you know if http://fluidengage.org/engage/home/home.html should work? the engage demo
2017-01-31T19:53:02 <colinclark> jessm: Unfortunately the Engage demo doesn't work in modern browsers
2017-01-31T19:53:09 <danayo> Caren: I am ready now - meet in my room
2017-01-31T19:53:19 <colinclark> it's sad, but I think we have screenshots or hi-fi mockups that should suffice
2017-01-31T19:54:21 <jessm> colinclark: i am just pointing to the \xe2\x80\x9cDraft 9\xe2\x80\x9d wireframes \xe2\x80\x94 i think they\xe2\x80\x99re the last? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11771507

2017-01-31T19:55:51 <colinclark> I don't remember, to be honest
2017-01-31T19:55:53 <colinclark> but it seems reasonable
2017-01-31T19:55:58 <colinclark> and they're nice looking wireframes
2017-01-31T19:57:04 <jessm> fluid-everyone: i read it yesterday and have already referenced it a few times which says to me it might be useful and important to others (or I keep repeating myself). have a look at this article about cognitive bias and also at the visualization at the bottom \xe2\x80\x94 very cool stuff

2017-01-31T19:59:12 <lliskovoi> jessm: very cool! Love the visualization!!
2017-01-31T19:59:28 <Justin_o> jessm: from what i remember those look like good wireframes to show the latest, also the user flow may also be helpful https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Mobile+design%2C+draft+9
