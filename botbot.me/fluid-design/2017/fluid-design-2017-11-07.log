2017-11-07T18:44:51 <michelled> danayo, sepidehshahi: it sounds like Jutta is going to focus on MyL3 for the Floe call. it might be a good time to update the narrative, if you feel like it https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIqIgJ3H7R_sj7ybrUYq-QZj0Zs-kU3wjUa_rNrHVZM/edit#heading=h.ki8fbxtlvt7d
2017-11-07T18:45:11 <michelled> I'll also give her the self reflection playground link https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/0mGummodODTaRJr#pdfviewer
2017-11-07T18:45:18 <michelled> are there other things you think I should include?
2017-11-07T18:45:43 <sepidehshahi> I was just reading that email. let me se
2017-11-07T18:50:03 <sepidehshahi> There are some new designs that we have put together for the MyL3. Do you think they can be added to the narrative? or we should hold on to them since they are still in progress
2017-11-07T18:50:15 <sepidehshahi> michelled: danayo ^
2017-11-07T18:50:36 <danayo> sepidehshahi, michelled: I think we could add them to the narrative for sure
2017-11-07T18:51:37 <michelled> sepidehshahi: they can be added - the narrative is not about 'finished' work (what ever that might mean) but about progress and process
2017-11-07T18:51:55 <sepidehshahi> sure
2017-11-07T18:52:48 <michelled> sepidehshahi: what are the topics of the new designs?
2017-11-07T18:52:57 <michelled> should I highlight them individually as well?
2017-11-07T18:54:14 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-11-07T18:57:52 <sepidehshahi> Their idea branched out of the reflection playground. They provide the tools and building blocks for the users, so they can decide what they want to track. They can also create specific queries and and track items related to those queries. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a topic for them, they are just our latest iterations michelled
2017-11-07T18:59:16 <michelled> can you give me a link sepidehshahi?
2017-11-07T18:59:52 <sepidehshahi> sure, let me export it to a PDF format
2017-11-07T19:00:49 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi

2017-11-07T19:05:59 <michelled> jhung: is there a page on the wiki that describes the create-a-thon and has some of the pics on it?

2017-11-07T19:20:45 <michelled> Caren_: maybe you know? ^
2017-11-07T19:21:54 <jhung> michelled: pics are in the OwnCloud.
2017-11-07T19:22:24 <jhung> The Energy Skate Park wiki main page describes the CaT and what was learned from it.
2017-11-07T19:22:51 <jhung> michelled: see https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Energy+Skate+Park+Simulation
2017-11-07T19:23:19 <jhung> michelled: I can forward you the same pics I sent to colinclark for his Coleman chat.
2017-11-07T19:23:46 <michelled> jhung, well, I think it would be better to have something to link to
2017-11-07T19:23:55 <michelled> but maybe I should just link to colin's keynote
2017-11-07T19:24:04 <colinclark> those pics were very very useful
2017-11-07T19:24:49 <Caren_> looks like you have what you need, michelled ? LMK if I can help
2017-11-07T19:25:20 <colinclark> hey Caren_!
2017-11-07T19:25:23 <colinclark> How's it going?
2017-11-07T19:25:24 <jhung> michelled: would it be helpful if some of those CaT images went onto the ESP wiki page? Then both will be in the same place.
2017-11-07T19:25:34 <colinclark> jhung: YES! :)
2017-11-07T19:25:37 <michelled> yes! that would be awesome
2017-11-07T19:25:44 <colinclark> or on a more general CaT-themed wiki page
2017-11-07T19:25:50 <Caren_> not bad colinclark
2017-11-07T19:25:57 <jhung> colinclark, michelled: righty-o. I'll do that.
2017-11-07T19:25:57 <colinclark> that may be a more long-term approach
2017-11-07T19:25:59 <michelled> also, jhung, Caren_ would it be possible to flesh this out a bit? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Faraday%27s+Law+Simulation
2017-11-07T19:26:04 <Caren_> in ODI report land
2017-11-07T19:26:09 <michelled> thank jhung!
2017-11-07T19:26:13 <colinclark> Caren_: Do you have a couple of minutes to chat at 3 pm?
2017-11-07T19:26:37 <Caren_> sure colinclark
2017-11-07T19:26:44 <colinclark> it's all good news :)
2017-11-07T19:26:54 <Caren_> :D
2017-11-07T19:27:38 <jhung> michelled: sure I can add and tighten what I can to the Faraday wiki page.
2017-11-07T19:27:58 <michelled> cool, if it's too much right now, jhung, let me know and I can leave that off the list
2017-11-07T19:28:02 <michelled> and send it next time
2017-11-07T19:28:25 <michelled> there is generally a Hewlett grantees meeting in Feb that we'll need a list of things for :)

2017-11-07T20:04:57 <sepidehshahi> danayo: if you have difficulty connecting to my room, we can switch to another room
2017-11-07T20:05:29 <danayo> sorry sepidehshahi be right there!
2017-11-07T20:05:51 <sepidehshahi> no rush, thanks
2017-11-07T20:06:26 <colinclark> hey Caren_, shall we talk on Vidyo or on Skype or something?
2017-11-07T20:07:21 <Caren_> I have both open so either works for me.
2017-11-07T20:07:33 <Caren_> whatever you have open
2017-11-07T20:07:42 <Caren_> colinclark: ^
2017-11-07T20:12:29 <jhung> michelled: I've updated the ESP wiki page with some images. Let me know if that's sufficient. I will work on faraday now.
