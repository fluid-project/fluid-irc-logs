2017-08-21T15:04:24 <jhung> grrrero: I was taking a look at your icon font guide. I ran into a peculiar issue with a file I was working with (see Own Cloud > IDRC-Design > Projects > BIG IDEA > Logos >\xc2\xa0BI logo_BLACK.ai). For some reason the text in that file is said to be 227.5417 inches, so when I run the height scaling action on it, it becomes tiny. I have no idea why the text height is so weird.
2017-08-21T15:05:22 <jhung> Not an urgent issue\xe2\x80\xa6 just something I encountered which is weird / interesting. I\'ll continue going through the guide but with a different file.
2017-08-21T15:15:11 <grrrero> jhung: I\'ll look into that later this afternoon, too. Thanks for finding that!

2017-08-21T15:39:49 <jhung> yep danayo. Found it. I\'ll put it in my todo list for today / tomorrow.
2017-08-21T15:39:57 <danayo> great thanks
2017-08-21T15:46:16 <danayo> Justin_o: I can meet now - or after 1:30 your time

2017-08-21T17:00:47 <jhung> fluid-everyone: anyone have something to talk about for tomorrow\'s design crit?
2017-08-21T17:01:20 <Justin_o> jhung: I don\'t think i have anything
2017-08-21T17:04:11 <gmoss> jhung, late last week danayo suggested that we could do a crit about the SJRK storytelling tool design wireframes
2017-08-21T17:04:23 <gmoss> so that\'s an option, if we like!

2017-08-21T19:37:46 <danayo> gmoss here is the page I created https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28SJRK%29+Digital+Storytelling+Tool+Design
2017-08-21T19:37:56 <danayo> I made two headings but feel free to edit
2017-08-21T19:38:18 <danayo> I thought "Ongoing Design Discussion" could be where I\'ll copy over a summary of our email thread
2017-08-21T19:39:02 <gmoss> Excellent, thanks danayo! yes that makes sense.. I\'ll put a more condensed list of the specific questions under Open Design Questions, then
2017-08-21T19:39:08 <gmoss> and we can go over this tomorrow
2017-08-21T19:39:10 <danayo> cool
2017-08-21T19:43:00 <danayo> gmoss: for now I\'ve linked to the new page from here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/SJRK+Web+Storytelling+Tools

2017-08-21T19:48:15 <jhung> gmoss, danayo: Is there a wiki page I should include in my design crit email for this week?
2017-08-21T19:49:20 <danayo> I think this would be best jhung https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/SJRK+Web+Storytelling+Tools
2017-08-21T19:50:42 <jhung> thanks danayo!
2017-08-21T19:55:31 <jhung> Justin_o: the collab room is booked this week and next, correct?
