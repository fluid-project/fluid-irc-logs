2017-09-20T15:53:18 <Jess_> Caren_: yes!
2017-09-20T15:53:27 <Caren_> awesome!
2017-09-20T15:54:01 <Jess_> Caren_: after 2:30 would be better for me. i really want to go to the comm. mtg.
2017-09-20T15:54:08 * michelled joined the channel
2017-09-20T15:54:13 <Jess_> danayo: not sure I have the subaward agreement for TIG
2017-09-20T15:54:23 <Jess_> mabye it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out afterall
2017-09-20T15:54:27 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-20T15:55:00 <Caren_> after 2:30 is good for me Jess_. I want to go to the community meet, too. Looking forward to it.
2017-09-20T15:55:03 <danayo> ah - perhaps Jess_ and alanharnum you are thinking of the consolidated workplan that I sent ?
2017-09-20T15:55:08 <danayo> rather than the subaward letter
2017-09-20T15:58:56 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-20T16:00:42 <Caren_> everyone: something I was going to share in the community meeting a faculty talk by Isabel Meirelles tomorrow at 205 Richmond rm 420. I believe everyon has received an email. I have her book Design for Information, which I find to be a solid guide to the history, theories and practice of effective info visualization.
2017-09-20T16:07:35 <danayo> alanharnum: I think I found your comments about the SJRK site in the PR - when you refer to background images, you mean the yellow paper, right?
2017-09-20T16:07:57 <alanharnum> danayo: yup
2017-09-20T16:08:03 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-20T16:09:08 <danayo> cool. so  3 issues, right alanharnum?  1. text sizing in the blobs, 2. contrast colour for the blobs, and 3. contrast colour for the yellow background, right?
2017-09-20T16:09:23 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah, I think those are the big ones
2017-09-20T16:09:30 <danayo> ok, thanks
2017-09-20T16:09:39 * lliskovoi_ joined the channel
2017-09-20T16:09:58 <danayo> and for 1. there\'s no "easy" fix, other than removing the blobs alanharnum ?
2017-09-20T16:12:41 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-09-20T16:13:41 <danayo> sepidehshahi: did you say you wanted to meet between 3:30 and 4:30 ?
2017-09-20T16:13:44 <alanharnum> danayo: text sizing is the hardest to fix without changes to design. we could look at increasing the blob size, but then the blobs will start to overlap. One thing that might work would be to remove some of the fixed-width behaviour and let things spread out more.
2017-09-20T16:14:53 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I thought community meeting ends at 3:30, but it seems to be don at 2:30. So any time between 2:30 to 4:30 works for me
2017-09-20T16:15:09 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, sounds good
2017-09-20T16:16:29 <danayo> alanharnum: thanks, I wonder, if we let things spread out more like that, if its possible to flip to the responsive menu when the blobs get too close?
2017-09-20T16:17:59 <danayo> I\'m also ok with letting go of the blobs :)
2017-09-20T16:18:00 <danayo> we could just have simple text across the top, with a bar to indicate current page
2017-09-20T16:18:14 <danayo> I\'ll grab avtar for a chat when he\'s in
2017-09-20T16:20:39 <alanharnum> danayo: I made a build of avtar\'s latest version with UIO, which you can have a look at via Rawgit: https://rawgit.com/waharnum/sojustrepairit.org/master/index.html - that will probably help with visualizng the issues
2017-09-20T16:21:35 <danayo> very helpful thanks alanharnum!

2017-09-20T16:37:03 <danayo> michelled, Caren_: I think it would be good to chat with avtar first - there may be a quick solution for now
2017-09-20T16:38:29 <Caren_> michelled, danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to help if I can. LMK
2017-09-20T16:38:45 <danayo> great Caren_, thanks
2017-09-20T16:40:00 <avtar> Caren_, danayo: would you like to hop on a call after the community meeting?

2017-09-20T16:40:20 <danayo> avtar!
2017-09-20T16:41:26 <Caren_> Jess_ can we meet at 3:30?
2017-09-20T16:42:02 <avtar> danayo: how about 3:00?
2017-09-20T16:42:15 <avtar> 3:00 edt
2017-09-20T16:42:39 <danayo> 3:00 ET works for me avtar
2017-09-20T16:43:31 <Caren_> avtar, danayo: I should be good at 3edt
2017-09-20T16:43:44 <danayo> I created a quick sketch of a simplified design avtar, alanharnum, Caren_ https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/BYMgFhylANgseo0
2017-09-20T16:44:23 <danayo> wondering if we could at least maintain those blocks of colour and sketchy diagonal lines in the contrast modes
2017-09-20T16:44:56 <danayo> sketchy diagonal lines as well as the underlines
