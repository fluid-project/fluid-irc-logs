2017-08-08T15:34:35 <Justin_o> danayo: when would be a good time to chat about the UIO+ design feedback that greg left on the GPII architecture list
2017-08-08T15:37:54 <danayo> NOW would be a good time Justin_o!
2017-08-08T15:38:07 <danayo> if that works for you :)

2017-08-08T15:45:14 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss: I\'m super excited about the story-gathering tool. Nice work!
2017-08-08T15:45:53 <alanharnum> danayo: thanks - it\'s nice to have something up, even in basic form
2017-08-08T15:46:03 <danayo> definitely
2017-08-08T15:47:04 <danayo> would love a quick SJRK check-in at some point alanharnum, if you have time. I\'ll get caught up on emails etc and then can I ping you?
2017-08-08T15:47:37 <alanharnum> danayo: sure - any time after 1 EST should work for me
2017-08-08T15:47:46 <danayo> great

2017-08-08T17:24:31 <danayo> Justin_o: I downloaded the crx file but can\'t seem to figure out how to find it in my Chrome extensions
2017-08-08T17:24:59 <Justin_o> danayo: you have to drag and drop it into the chrome://extensions page
2017-08-08T17:25:35 <Justin_o> after that you allow it to install, it should show up under "GPII Chrome Extension"  on that page, and add a "G" icon to the browser
2017-08-08T17:27:20 <danayo> got it Justin_o, thanks
2017-08-08T17:29:45 <Justin_o> danayo: np, let me know what you think
2017-08-08T17:29:49 <danayo> Justin_o: one of them is just labelled "click to select" - is that a placeholder?
2017-08-08T17:29:52 <danayo> for sure Justin_o
2017-08-08T17:30:22 <Justin_o> danayo: no that\'s what it does, it lets you right click to select a block of text
2017-08-08T17:30:28 <danayo> OMG
2017-08-08T17:30:28 <Justin_o> let me know if you think of a better name :)
2017-08-08T17:30:31 <danayo> haha
2017-08-08T17:30:43 <danayo> that is so interesting
2017-08-08T17:30:57 <Justin_o> :)
2017-08-08T17:31:14 <danayo> I\'ll give that some thought - I think it will need renaming
2017-08-08T17:32:05 <danayo> I think it\'s partly because it\'s the only one that sounds like a command, rather than a label Justin_o
2017-08-08T17:33:14 <danayo> maybe something like "single-click select" or "one-click select" ... still thinking
2017-08-08T17:37:27 <Justin_o> right-click select
2017-08-08T17:37:28 <Justin_o> ?
2017-08-08T17:37:37 <Justin_o> at any rate, i\'m open to suggestions :)
2017-08-08T17:37:51 <Justin_o> and you make a good point about it sounding like a command
