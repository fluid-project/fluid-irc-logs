2017-02-06T16:13:54 <Jess_> jhung: ping
2017-02-06T16:19:16 <jhung> hey Jess_.
2017-02-06T16:20:50 <Jess_> jhung: it looks like the OER Commons folks want to update to the new version of UIO. their lead dev andre lives in California now so time zones will be easier. and they want to start chatting on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day to spread love :)
2017-02-06T16:21:39 <Jess_> given the outcomes of the OER tools meeting (OERC and OpenStax and Pressbooks all sharing) it\xe2\x80\x99ll be great to have UIO in there
2017-02-06T16:22:04 <jhung> Jess_: awesome. I can send them some resources before that meeting if it's helpful.
2017-02-06T16:22:20 <jhung> This also means that I need to push up the missing UIO documentation soon too.
2017-02-06T16:23:51 <Jess_> sure, that sounds amazing! a pre V-day present
2017-02-06T16:24:01 <Jess_> +1 to missing docs
2017-02-06T16:28:07 <jhung> Jess_: ok. Give me a chance to try to get these docs ship shape. It'll be better to send a single email with all of that than two separate emails.
2017-02-06T16:28:27 <Jess_> jhung: agreed \xe2\x80\x94 no hurry, just a heads-up
2017-02-06T16:28:47 <jhung> great. Thanks Jess_.

2017-02-06T21:47:30 <jhung_mtg> fluid-everyone: Is it Monday already? Does anyone have anything to share for tomorrow's design crit?
2017-02-06T22:00:54 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I'll leave tomorrow's crit unscheduled. I find myself forgetting about the crit now that the planning meeting happens on Tuesdays. I've now set a reminder to ask the channel for topics. I hope this will get me back on track.
