2017-01-27T15:43:37 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Anyone want to share a design for next week\'s design crit?

2017-01-27T15:48:33 <danayo> thanks jhung, I think it might be a good time to look at the privacy wireframes again, since we\'re going to have to "freeze" them soom (for now)
2017-01-27T15:48:40 <danayo> *soon
2017-01-27T15:49:31 <jhung> danayo: that\'s great. We can do that.
2017-01-27T15:49:49 <danayo> and I will also email Caren to see if she\'d be willing to bring the storyboard work
2017-01-27T15:49:53 <danayo> jhung
2017-01-27T15:49:59 <jhung> anyone else? Ideas: Oak, BIG IDeA, ID Landing Page.
2017-01-27T15:50:37 <jhung> danayo: awesome. I\'ll put privacy down for Tuesday.
2017-01-27T15:53:02 <danayo> thanks jhung

2017-01-27T16:58:46 <clown> danayo, michelled:  ready when you are.
2017-01-27T17:28:49 <colinclark> hey lliskovoi, did you hear from avtar today?
2017-01-27T17:28:55 <colinclark> apparently he can\'t find his Nexus 5
2017-01-27T17:29:36 <colinclark> my suggestion is to have a quick chat with Iris and Vera\xe2\x80\x94we should have a way to buy an Android phone suitable for testing on

2017-01-27T20:12:10 <danayo> simonjb another interesting definition of tracking, related to ownership and also collection+retention: https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection
2017-01-27T20:12:35 <danayo> (plus I love their logo) :)
2017-01-27T20:13:00 <simonjb> thanks danayo taking a look

2017-01-27T20:16:38 <danayo> FYI clown: don\'t know if you noticed but firefox allows you to set up a "trust list" in Privacy settings / History --> Exceptions (you can allow / block / allow for session)
2017-01-27T20:17:59 <simonjb> danayo: the EFF DNT Policy (linked from the Disconnect page) looks quite interesting also (I hadn\'t seen it before) https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy
2017-01-27T20:18:28 <danayo> cool simonjb, thanks

2017-01-27T20:28:08 <clown> danayo, I had forgotten about that dialog.  It also provides finer grained control on each site:  "Allow" vs. "Allow for Session" vs. "Block"
2017-01-27T20:30:26 <clown> oh right, you already pointed that out.
2017-01-27T20:30:43 <danayo> :)
