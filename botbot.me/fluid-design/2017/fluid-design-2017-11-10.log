2017-11-10T16:52:32 <gmoss> grrrero: I don\'t think it is for most people
2017-11-10T16:52:38 <michelled> grrrero: no long weekend for us :)
2017-11-10T16:52:38 <gmoss> maybe for banks and government
2017-11-10T16:52:42 <grrrero> Ahhhh
2017-11-10T16:52:43 <grrrero> Ok
2017-11-10T16:52:57 <grrrero> My brother works for a bank and he\'s the one who told me it was a long weekend

2017-11-10T16:58:20 <gmoss> clown: I thought so too! I\'m excited to see the other upcoming collabs between Vox and 99% Invisible. I\'m a big fan of Vox and I really like 99PI also

2017-11-10T17:00:37 <gmoss> one of the comments piqued my interest: "Biomimicry is merely copying the output of evolution. Much more powerful outputs are generated when you copy the process with computational evolution. It also means the output can be more specific.\xef\xbb\xbf"
