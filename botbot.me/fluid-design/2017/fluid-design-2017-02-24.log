2017-02-24T16:01:23 <jhung> lliskovoi: I have found a theme which might work well for what we want. It\'s a base theme designed to be a template for theme building. Do you want to do a quick Vidyo call in a few minutes to take a look at it?
2017-02-24T16:02:09 <lliskovoi> great jhung! sure
2017-02-24T16:05:36 <jhung> lliskovoi: I\'m ready now.

2017-02-24T18:28:26 <danayo> hi jhung, do you know if we have any further info on the fluidproject wiki that gives detailed guidance about how to use the wiki? mostly looking to see if we provide info about creating an account, and editing a page. Thought maybe I could add something here if not: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved. We want to ask our SJRK partners to provide input on a wiki page - but for those who haven\'t used it before I thoug
2017-02-24T18:28:26 <danayo> this might be good to have
2017-02-24T18:29:46 <jhung> danayo: I found this, but a bit old. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Using+a+wiki
2017-02-24T18:30:25 <jhung> The wiki has changed a lot since then and some of it is easier (i.e. inserting images etc.)
2017-02-24T18:31:54 <danayo> thanks jhung, i saw that, but it doesn\'t give specific instruction - seems like more of a "what" than a "how-to"
2017-02-24T18:32:02 <danayo> and as you say, a bit old too
2017-02-24T18:32:59 <jhung> danayo: Yeah I don\'t think a guide was ever written on how to use the Wiki. I wonder if Atlassian has a guide?
2017-02-24T18:33:57 <jhung> danayo: This might be helpful? https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/pages-and-blogs-320602215.html
2017-02-24T18:34:41 <danayo> thanks jhung, I think that should cover it
2017-02-24T18:35:15 <jhung> awesome danayo
2017-02-24T18:37:30 <jhung> I\'ve added a link to that page on the Get Involved page too danayo
2017-02-24T18:37:36 <danayo> just saw that!
2017-02-24T18:37:39 <danayo> nice, thanks
2017-02-24T18:37:51 <jhung> np
2017-02-24T18:38:36 <danayo> jhung, one more question, when someone signs up for an account, it\'s active immediate, right? or does it require approval? can\'t remember
2017-02-24T18:39:05 <jhung> Oh, I don\'t know actually. I\'m pretty sure they need to get validated danayo. Let me see if I can find out...
2017-02-24T18:41:35 * noveens joined the channel
2017-02-24T18:42:06 <danayo> looks like it\'s immediate jhung
2017-02-24T18:42:11 <danayo> i just created a second account :)
2017-02-24T18:42:18 <jhung> danayo: ok.

2017-02-24T20:38:08 <danayo> Caren, shall we meet without alanharnum for now?

2017-02-24T22:10:23 <danayo> hmm not sure about those capital I bars when they\'re bit and bold alanharnum, Caren. what do you think? They really seem to stand out
2017-02-24T22:10:28 <danayo> *big and bold
2017-02-24T22:10:58 * cindyli has quit
2017-02-24T22:11:00 <danayo> maybe it\'s the letter spacing

2017-02-24T22:12:18 <alanharnum> Caren: "caching" (the web developer excuse for why anything doesn\'t look right on someone else\'s computer!)
2017-02-24T22:13:33 <alanharnum> I find this setting essential to have turned on in Chrome, if that\'s what you\'re using: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5690269/disabling-chrome-cache-for-website-development
2017-02-24T22:13:46 <alanharnum> ensures that if you have the dev tools open, caching is always turned off
2017-02-24T22:14:19 <Caren> ah will do that after my call. thanks :-)

2017-02-24T23:21:00 <Caren> needs more space (kerning) on either side of the character\xe2\x80\xa6I will explore that on Monday.
