2017-10-18T14:47:23 <lliskovoi> everyone: Is anyone familiar with schema markup and its impact (if any) on accessibility?
2017-10-18T14:50:35 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: not exactly sure if this is what you mean, but perhaps the metadata stuff from here might help https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Metadata+Authoring+and+Feedback+Tools
2017-10-18T14:51:07 <lliskovoi> thanks Justin_o, I'll have a look!
2017-10-18T14:52:53 <jhung> lliskovoi: the most common use of a11y metadata is to enable content matching. I think Google has options to search metadata so you get more relevant results (see https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data)
2017-10-18T15:01:44 <jhung> Caren_: Ariel replied. How is this Friday or Monday?

2017-10-18T15:04:47 <Caren_> Hi jhung : with my 4-day week I\xe2\x80\x99m not here on Mondays so Friday it would need to be for me. Does that works for you?
2017-10-18T15:06:31 <jhung> yeah it works for Friday Caren_. Would 1pm ET be okay?
2017-10-18T15:06:55 <Caren_> sure, thanks jhung
