2017-03-21T13:54:01 <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit will be starting in about 7 minutes in the fluid-standup Vidyo room. Today we will be watching a video from Liz Sanders discussing Co-Creation and Co-design. We will be using this Google Doc for notes. Link to the video is also in the google doc. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efEpvn9eHmoRO53EqAukkarwzfUDUrGinUQqVj0YEyE/edit?usp=sharing

2017-03-21T15:54:50 <alanharnum> danayo, do you need us to set anything up here in collab room for 3:00 SJRK meeting?
2017-03-21T15:55:40 <alanharnum> whiteboard or similar?
2017-03-21T15:55:48 <alanharnum> not sure how you want to approach the mapping
2017-03-21T15:58:11 * colinclark has quit
2017-03-21T16:00:35 <danayo> thanks alanharnum - the whiteboard might be useful - or we could also try using a google drawing - as long as we can collaboratively work on it
2017-03-21T16:01:02 <alanharnum> danayo: since you and Jess_ and others are remote, a collaborative online tool would probably work better
2017-03-21T16:01:49 <danayo> sounds good alanharnum - will also provide a living doc that we can more easily develop over the course of the project

2017-03-21T16:29:15 <danayo> hi Caren, I made a few last minor changes (as we had discussed the last time we spoke, and a few additional things) - I think it\'s ready to send out - let me know if you agree https://xd.adobe.com/view/073c6a81-f6c9-4999-b838-e11295cd6662/

2017-03-21T18:03:40 <danayo> Justin_o: not before 4 or 4:30 today - probably too late for you?
2017-03-21T18:03:54 <Justin_o> danayo: 4 would be okay, but 4:30 would be too late
2017-03-21T18:04:03 <danayo> I\'ll ping you Justin_o
2017-03-21T18:04:03 <Justin_o> danayo: we could talk tomorrow morning instead i guess

2017-03-21T18:50:07 <Jess_> Justin_o: sounds like kathy and grass are getting close to wanting to get some feedback. do you have time tomorrow to finish up the crit with them and then talk about getting them into a design community meeting?
2017-03-21T18:51:56 <Justin_o> Jess_: sure, but the next community meeting availability is Apr 26, which might be a bit late.. not sure
2017-03-21T18:52:24 <Jess_> Justin_o: well, perhaps we can book that one and try to get another ad hoc meeting too
2017-03-21T18:52:25 <Justin_o> Jess_: i suppose we could do it this week, but that might be too early
2017-03-21T18:52:44 <Justin_o> yah.. an ad hoc could meeting could work
2017-03-21T18:55:15 <Justin_o> Jess_: perhaps they could present their work on the OER resources.. e.g. their "final" version at the April 26 meeting.. it will be a nice tie in to the Hewlett OER meeting that week
2017-03-21T18:56:28 <Jess_> good idea Justin_o!
2017-03-21T18:56:54 <Jess_> kathy: grass: we can talk more about this with you two tomorrow, but this is a big meeting with out funder
