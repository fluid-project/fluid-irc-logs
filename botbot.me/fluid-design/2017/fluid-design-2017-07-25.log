2017-07-25T13:33:04 <jhung> Hey Jess_. You pinged me yesterday re: Pressbooks. I joined the meeting. Ned is going to hook us up with some test data, and I also gave some feedback for their early wireframes.
2017-07-25T13:33:18 <Jess_> jhung: great!
2017-07-25T13:38:01 <Jess_> jhung: need a favour

2017-07-25T13:47:43 <jhung> Jess_: pong
2017-07-25T13:48:12 <Jess_> jhung: i need a favour. i\xe2\x80\x99ve double booked myself during the crit today and lisa and i were going to tag-team the persona creation
2017-07-25T13:48:47 <Jess_> jhung: the goal is to create 4 (probably) personas that we can use to demonstrate some WCAG principles AND the curb cut for them
2017-07-25T13:48:58 <Jess_> can you give lliskavoi a hand in the crit?
2017-07-25T13:49:16 <Jess_> i doubt she\xe2\x80\x99ll need anything, but was hoping to tag-team
2017-07-25T13:49:40 <jhung> Jess_: sure. I\'ll give her a hand.
2017-07-25T13:49:50 <Jess_> thanks jhung !
2017-07-25T13:49:57 <jhung> no prob
2017-07-25T13:52:54 <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit starts in about 8 minutes. Today we\'re doing a design exercise to create personas for WCAG compliance and making some curb cuts for them.

2017-07-25T14:26:43 <colinclark> I have no idea :)
2017-07-25T14:26:45 <colinclark> oh ok

2017-07-25T15:29:29 <jhung> lliskovoi, Jess_ - I really like the format. It would be good to compile all the outcomes in a published form somehow after a couple workshops. It\'d be handy as a resource.
2017-07-25T15:29:56 <Jess_> jhung: exactly!
2017-07-25T15:30:53 <lliskovoi> jhung, Jess_ great idea!
2017-07-25T15:36:26 <jhung> Jess_: Does the screen sharing show up for you?
2017-07-25T15:39:54 <Jess_> jhung: yes, i see the screenshare Jon, but your video is a bit degraded. perhaps you\'re having a bandwidth issue
2017-07-25T15:40:39 <jhung> Thanks Jess_. Yeah I\'ve been having issues today. I want to reboot my router, but not until I\'m done these meetings. :)

2017-07-25T18:15:42 <danayo> grrrero, jhung, Justin_o: i found one example of an icon "master" file, from Cloud4All https://www.dropbox.com/s/zat1qlw708sdrkg/c4a-all-icons.ai?dl=0
2017-07-25T18:16:16 <danayo> but it\'s old, so I wouldn\'t worry about converting it
2017-07-25T18:16:32 <danayo> just an example of a place where we were keeping a set of icons for a project
2017-07-25T18:16:41 <grrrero> Cool danayo!
2017-07-25T18:19:10 <danayo> grrrero: here\'s another one https://www.dropbox.com/s/itoqb1zbakr03mr/First%20Discovery%20font%20icons.pdf?dl=0
2017-07-25T18:38:11 <grrrero> danayo & jhung: What would be the ideal size in pixels for the SVG web fonts?

2017-07-25T19:00:27 * danayo_ has quit
2017-07-25T19:10:34 <jhung> grrrero: It can be pretty much any size. I like to keep it anywhere between 50x50 to 100x100. I like using odd number dimensions as well so there\'s a definite centre pixel.

2017-07-25T19:34:26 <danayo> do you mean a template file grrrero?
2017-07-25T19:34:35 <grrrero> Yeah, danayo?
2017-07-25T19:35:08 <danayo> sure grrrero, with a few artboards to start, and maybe some instructions ?
2017-07-25T19:35:19 <grrrero> That would be great danayo
2017-07-25T19:38:52 <danayo> are you able to create it grrrero? do you need some help?
2017-07-25T19:39:24 <grrrero> Yeah, I was wondering if you had a bunch of icons already or should we use what we have
2017-07-25T19:39:28 <grrrero> ^ danayo
2017-07-25T19:40:30 <danayo> ah, I see! I was thinking more of creating a blank template. but I guess we should also start a master file for UIO. I think we need both. What do you think jhung?

2017-07-25T19:49:31 <Justin_o> grrrero: here\'s the wiki page i was thinking about regarding our previous font icon research https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Research+of+viability+of+using+icon+fonts+in+UI+Options
2017-07-25T19:50:03 <Justin_o> i think making something as a child page of this or a sibling to the SVG Icon research page would be fine, but you should probably reference this from your page, just to keep things linked together
2017-07-25T19:50:16 <grrrero> Ok Justin_o

2017-07-25T20:05:28 <jhung> grrrero: I say let\'s start with a blank template and the actions to normalize and export to SVG. Then we\'ll retrofit as needed and / or use the template + actions going forward.
2017-07-25T20:06:44 <grrrero> jhung: Gotcha
