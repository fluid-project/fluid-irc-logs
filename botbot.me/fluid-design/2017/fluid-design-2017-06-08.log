2017-06-08T18:22:19 <Justin_o> kathy_: alanharnum did some work to get an svgs of the IDRC logo that is also styled to match the contrast themes
2017-06-08T18:22:27 <Justin_o> this is the svg https://github.com/waharnum/floeproject.org/blob/f72ac69e86ce177dbc7c7bab8060115f931bbd3b/images/idrc-logo.svg
2017-06-08T18:22:38 <kathy_> thank you!
2017-06-08T18:24:38 <Justin_o> here's an example of styling it https://github.com/waharnum/floeproject.org/blob/f72ac69e86ce177dbc7c7bab8060115f931bbd3b/css/style.css#L621-L628
2017-06-08T18:24:51 <jhung> Caren, Justin_o - we're looking at this https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Energy+Skatepark+Free+Form+Track+Construction
2017-06-08T18:25:30 <Justin_o> kathy_: you can use the currentColor keyword, which tells it to just use the what the value of colour is for the fill as well.
