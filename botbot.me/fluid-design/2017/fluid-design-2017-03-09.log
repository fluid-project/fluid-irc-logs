2017-03-09T17:12:49 <danayo> hi clown, question for you about privacy prefs
2017-03-09T17:13:07 <clown> danayo, sure.
2017-03-09T17:14:36 * michelled has quit
2017-03-09T17:16:31 <danayo> do you think it\'s better to structure the prefs like so, clown: Never allow any services (OFF)
2017-03-09T17:16:32 <danayo> Allow all services always (ON with no exceptions)
2017-03-09T17:16:33 <danayo> ON with exceptions:
2017-03-09T17:16:35 <danayo> Allow on as-needed basis only
2017-03-09T17:16:36 <danayo> Always alert/ask me first
2017-03-09T17:16:37 <danayo> Allow trusted services only
2017-03-09T17:16:38 <danayo> ?
2017-03-09T17:16:45 <danayo> or to just have 5 individual options
2017-03-09T17:17:05 <danayo> I guess my question is more about ease of implementation, rather than the UI at this point
2017-03-09T17:17:26 <danayo> hope that\'s clear :)
2017-03-09T17:18:42 <clown> my gut says that UI is important, and to ask which form is more understandable to the user.  That said, I don\'t know off-hand about the implications of implementation.  Let me think a bit.
2017-03-09T17:19:55 <danayo> I agree clown (about UI). i guess i\'m wondering if it would create more complications for you at this point? Or if it makes no difference
2017-03-09T17:20:22 <clown> One thought:  If there is an all-on and an all-off setting, then the code would just need to check that first, and be done rather than checking each setting individually.
2017-03-09T17:20:53 <clown> and, if niether of the "all" is set, then the system would have to process each individual setting.
2017-03-09T17:21:07 <clown> So, it might be more efiicient to have the catch-all settings.
2017-03-09T17:22:28 <clown> Regarding a difference to me:  I\'m not actually writing the code to use the preferences, just specifying them and showing how to encode them in a data structure (json5).
2017-03-09T17:22:53 <clown> But, I suppose I should think a bit about the implications of that data structure for the people who write the code to deal with it.
2017-03-09T17:23:06 <clown> thanks for making me thing about that.
2017-03-09T17:23:09 <clown> *think
2017-03-09T17:23:32 <danayo> you\'re welcome :) to be clear - you mean it might be more efficient to have 5 separate settings, right clown? i.e. no ON with exceptions
2017-03-09T17:23:54 <danayo> I was thinking that in terms of UX, having exceptions might be clearer to the user
2017-03-09T17:24:03 <danayo> but that\'s just my opinion
2017-03-09T17:24:30 <clown> I mean it\'s more efficient to have 1. all off, 2. all on, 3. on with exceptions.
2017-03-09T17:25:09 <danayo> ah, I see, ok
2017-03-09T17:26:28 <clown> cool.
2017-03-09T17:32:56 <clown> gotta run to my next telecon.

2017-03-09T17:33:19 <Justin_o> danayo: i think there were some designs for keeping the UIO tab at the top all the time. Is that correct?
2017-03-09T17:34:28 <danayo> Justin_o: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+%28Learner%29+Options+Mobile+and+Responsive+Design?preview=/66551842/105119765/Learner%20Options%20Flex%20Integration%20Example.pdf
2017-03-09T17:34:40 <danayo> think that\'s what you mean?
2017-03-09T17:34:51 <Justin_o> danayo: yes thanks
2017-03-09T17:35:16 <Justin_o> danayo: is that something we\'d like to do, and if so, which of those options is preferred?
2017-03-09T17:37:15 <danayo> Justin_o: yes, we discussed it at a crit with respect to tab order and decided that would be a better approach. I think the design that maintains the drop shadow/tab style is better because it stands out more (as much as I love flat design :) )
2017-03-09T17:38:45 <Justin_o> danayo: okay.. we can probably make it fixed, and the panel will slide out underneath of it
2017-03-09T17:38:51 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'ll try to work on that part now
2017-03-09T17:38:56 <danayo> great Justin_o
2017-03-09T17:48:47 <Justin_o> danayo: hmm.. so a problem
2017-03-09T17:49:16 <Justin_o> because the tab lives in the main content document, when you make adjustments to the settings in the prefs editor it applies to it right away
2017-03-09T17:49:43 <Justin_o> so for example if we increase text size it will grow over top of the content
2017-03-09T17:49:47 <Justin_o> of the prefs editor

2017-03-09T17:51:03 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2017-03-09T17:52:14 <danayo> can we take it out of the main content doc somehow Justin_o ?
2017-03-09T17:53:00 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'m not sure
2017-03-09T17:53:41 <Justin_o> for example the lazy loading wouldn\'t work anymore because it pulls in the iframe contents after the panel is opened, but if the trigger to open the panel is inside of the iframe, that just won\'t work
2017-03-09T17:54:32 <Justin_o> also it would complicate things for a user who would want to have other items in that horizontal space
2017-03-09T17:54:47 <Justin_o> danayo: if you have time to vidyo it might be easier to chat through the issue
2017-03-09T17:59:21 <danayo> sure Justin_o
2017-03-09T17:59:45 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, please call me when you are ready
