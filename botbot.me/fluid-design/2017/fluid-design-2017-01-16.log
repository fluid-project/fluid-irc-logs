2017-01-16T19:52:30 <colinclark> I'm missing that other 40% of avtar's time these days, as is gtirloni I'm sure :)
2017-01-16T19:52:52 <gtirloni> :)
2017-01-16T19:53:46 <gtirloni> yeah, it's mostly `git clone`, edit the yaml file and boom! hopefully all the automation they have done should just work. but we're here to help in case it doesn't :) and luckily for us, their setup is similar to waht we have been using

2017-01-16T19:02:50 <jhung> Jess__: I think we may need a Pressbooks instance running sooner rather than later.
2017-01-16T19:03:44 <jhung> Jess__: I feel that if we\'re going to point Ned toward the new UIO Wordpress plugin, we should have an instance running on our end so we have a better idea of how we can assist them.
2017-01-16T19:07:27 <Jess__> jhung: makes sense
2017-01-16T19:07:32 <Jess__> are they ready to get us what we need?
2017-01-16T19:08:30 <jhung> Yeah. I recall Ned mentioning that they updated the ansible playbook. So I think it may be easier for us Jess__.
2017-01-16T19:08:59 <jhung> I\'ll have to jog my memory and look back at the log.
2017-01-16T19:09:01 <Jess__> jhung: is it a matter of coordinating with gtirloni at this point then?
2017-01-16T19:09:26 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-01-16T19:09:49 <jhung> Jess__: possibly. I\'ll try to figure out where things are and I think gtirloni may be able to help us with getting an instance up somewhere.
2017-01-16T19:10:30 <Jess__> jhung: cool \xe2\x80\x94 lemme know how/if i can help
2017-01-16T19:17:18 <jhung> Here\'s the documentation Jess__, gtirloni: https://pressbooks.github.io/local-development/ m Not sure if there\'s an easier / quicker way to get an instance running (i,e. maybe make a VM of this somehow?).
2017-01-16T19:19:10 <colinclark> Is this for FLOE, jhung and Jess__?
2017-01-16T19:19:25 <Jess__> yes, Floe and farther
2017-01-16T19:20:23 <colinclark> Do we have a timeline for the resulting deliverable?
2017-01-16T19:20:41 <colinclark> when do you need this done by, and when do you think you\'ll have a demo of the resutling integration working?
2017-01-16T19:21:17 <Jess__> we are working with Rebus and pressbooks \xe2\x80\x94 so we are flexing in some ways to their ability to move forward. this is also connected to our ongoing Gates work
2017-01-16T19:21:22 <colinclark> and how does this interleave with the work emerging from big idea very soon for you, jhung?
2017-01-16T19:21:57 <jhung> colinclark: my sense was that Ned was going to do the integration. I\'m hoping to just provide support and improve our resources / documentation as it goes.
2017-01-16T19:22:07 <colinclark> I totally think that it\'s a good thing to do, Jess__, no question there
2017-01-16T19:22:07 <Jess__> the timeline is according to the Floe project deliverables \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested we\xe2\x80\x99ll have collaborated with them and coordinated on moving this forward
2017-01-16T19:22:35 <colinclark> jhung: Seems reasonable
2017-01-16T19:22:40 <colinclark> What\'s Ned\'s timeline?
2017-01-16T19:22:45 <colinclark> When does he want to do this by?
2017-01-16T19:23:09 <jhung> colinclark: Not sure how much interleaving there will be aside from making the UIO WP plugin more viable as a tool so it can be used as a resource for Big Ideas.
2017-01-16T19:23:20 <colinclark> ok
2017-01-16T19:23:45 <jhung> colinclark: I\'m not sure what his timeline is. Jess__ do you remember if he mentioned anything?
2017-01-16T19:23:47 <colinclark> I think this is awesome and important work, just to be clear :)
2017-01-16T19:24:05 <colinclark> I\'m just trying to figure out how we juggle it with the incredibly useful wave of big idea work on its way
2017-01-16T19:24:19 <colinclark> and the fact that gtirloni is swamped, especially due to his 50% commitment to APCP already
2017-01-16T19:25:21 <Jess__> Ned has hopefully made setup easy \xe2\x80\x94 it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a huge burden on gtirloni
2017-01-16T19:25:39 <Jess__> jhung: your sense was we need to do it soon-ish \xe2\x80\x94 last i heard Ned was ready. is that your understanding?
2017-01-16T19:25:44 <colinclark> I\'m sure it won\'t be a burden, Jess__
2017-01-16T19:26:00 <colinclark> but of course lots of little burdenless things do often turn into quite a lot of work
2017-01-16T19:26:23 <Jess__> which is why self-provisioning was gonna help so much!
2017-01-16T19:26:33 <colinclark> Yes
2017-01-16T19:26:36 <colinclark> This is precisely the issue
2017-01-16T19:26:51 <colinclark> lots of little things amount to not having time to implementing the hard stuff
2017-01-16T19:27:16 <colinclark> We totally should do the Pressbooks work\xe2\x80\x94it sounds greaet
2017-01-16T19:27:19 <colinclark> no issue there
2017-01-16T19:27:22 <colinclark> just want a clear sense of timeline
2017-01-16T19:27:39 <colinclark> and what\'s involved, and then I can think through who might have the skillset to help with it
2017-01-16T19:27:41 <jhung> Jess__: I think this was something he was hoping to get resolved. With the upcoming Rebus work, I think it makes sense that UIO be integrated with PB. As for getting an instance running - I honestly don\'t know how much work is involved. It hope it doesn\'t turn out to be a rabbit hole.
2017-01-16T19:27:58 <colinclark> in addition to the incredibly multi-talented gtirloni
2017-01-16T19:28:17 <Jess__> as jhung posted \xe2\x80\x94 https://pressbooks.github.io/local-development/
2017-01-16T19:28:26 <jhung> Jess__: yeah. I was looking at it.
2017-01-16T19:28:50 <Jess__> the sooner we get this setup the sooner we can do work with Pressbooks and REBUG re: UIO and a11y features that are already being used by Gates
2017-01-16T19:29:19 <colinclark> jhung: So it sounds like the next step might be to check in with Ned and say "hey, we want to help, do you have a timeline for when you\'re going to be working on it?" and try to sync up on a date?
2017-01-16T19:31:25 <jhung> sounds reasonable colinclark. I\'ll ping him and see.
2017-01-16T19:31:27 <gtirloni> jhung: hi! catching up on the conversation. could you clarify what is included in "get a pressbooks instance up"?
2017-01-16T19:31:31 <colinclark> awesome
2017-01-16T19:31:45 <colinclark> These instructions are for local installation\xe2\x80\x94are they something you could set up on your laptop, jhung?
2017-01-16T19:31:48 <colinclark> or do you want them on a server?
2017-01-16T19:32:21 <jhung> colinclark: I can certainly try that and see how far I can get.
2017-01-16T19:33:20 <colinclark> I think you\'d probably even be able to use avtar\'s templates and automate this in a VM pretty easily
2017-01-16T19:33:29 <colinclark> but you may not have the cycles for that much work :)
2017-01-16T19:33:40 <jhung> gtirloni: I honestly don\'t know what I meant by that since I haven\'t tried the installation procedure myself. :D I think what I was imagining was some sort of VM that had Pressbooks already installed (i.e. the install procedure already done).
2017-01-16T19:34:30 <Kobi> What are you working on right now?
2017-01-16T19:35:12 <Kobi> Whoops, sorry, ignore that
2017-01-16T19:36:27 <colinclark> I guess there\'s a spectrum of options, jhung
2017-01-16T19:36:39 <colinclark> 1. Installing it locally on your Mac, which is what the instructions seem to be tailored for
2017-01-16T19:36:55 <colinclark> 2. Manually provisioning a Linux VM and installing it there, so you have it separate from your computer
2017-01-16T19:37:14 <colinclark> 3. Taking these instructions and automating them using Avtar\'s PHP VM recipe
2017-01-16T19:37:24 <colinclark> 4. Hosting a server with a development instance of it
2017-01-16T19:37:36 <colinclark> #4 is actually the most complicated one from a number of perspectives
2017-01-16T19:37:49 <colinclark> including the fact that it becomes another service we have to maintain and secure and upgrade and patch
2017-01-16T19:38:15 <colinclark> which, if you\'re just doing development and testing to provide technical support, might be overkill
2017-01-16T19:38:45 <jhung> colinclark: I think Option #2 may be a reasonable route to start.
2017-01-16T19:39:29 <jhung> colinclark, Jess__: I just spoke with Ned and he said that UIO integration not in this release, but the next PB release\xe2\x80\xa6 around late Feb.
2017-01-16T19:41:42 <colinclark> oh cool
2017-01-16T19:41:44 <gtirloni> it seems pressbooks already did a bunch of automation around vagrant/ansible and what\'s left to do manually is those instructions in their local-development article.. that could be further automated but maybe they don\'t feel like going that route (it\'s basically downloading the pressbooks components through git and requiring a YAML config for the expected behavior).
2017-01-16T19:42:12 <jhung> gtirloni: ok great! Thanks for taking a look.
2017-01-16T19:42:12 <colinclark> gtirloni: Do we have any base recipes for provisioning a CentOS or Fedora box that jhung could use?
2017-01-16T19:42:43 <colinclark> jhung: Great to know about the dates, that\'s perfect
2017-01-16T19:44:00 <colinclark> Jess__: Does this seem like a reasonable way to proceed?
2017-01-16T19:45:31 <Jess__> colinclark: catching up\xe2\x80\xa6 If Ned could have access to the provisioned space that\xe2\x80\x99d be ideal
2017-01-16T19:46:00 <Jess__> gtirloni: ^
2017-01-16T19:46:02 <colinclark> why\'s that?
2017-01-16T19:46:07 <gtirloni> colinclark: i\'d have to give the pressbook\'s ansible/vagrant arrangement a try myself and see if there are any ideas for improvement. they\'ve based their code on a fairly complex setup for LEMP stack projects (https://github.com/roots/trellis)... it\'s probably not needed for a simple dev workflow but they probably had a reason to go that route
2017-01-16T19:46:20 <colinclark> My understanding t\x08was that Ned\'s doing the integration, and Jon just wanted an instance to try out in case of problems/questions?
2017-01-16T19:46:48 <colinclark> oh they already have an ansible vagrant arrangement!
2017-01-16T19:46:50 <colinclark> I was confused
2017-01-16T19:46:56 <gtirloni> yeah, they have
2017-01-16T19:46:58 <colinclark> so can jhung just use that?
2017-01-16T19:47:07 <Jess__> i have to touch base with him, but Ned was interested in a test bed and using our cloud was mentioned \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check with him again. but i have something else that is time sensitive just now
2017-01-16T19:47:11 <colinclark> and then manually do whatever is missing?
2017-01-16T19:47:26 <colinclark> ok, good to know, Jess__
2017-01-16T19:48:12 <gtirloni> colinclark: i think so, all of their vagrant/ansible automation and what\'s left to do is what\'s here: https://pressbooks.github.io/local-development/  (once the dependencies are installed, it\'s a cycle of "git clone + yaml .. vagrant up")
2017-01-16T19:48:28 <gtirloni> that should give jhung the same environment pressbooks uses to develop on
2017-01-16T19:49:04 <colinclark> ah, that\'s pretty good
2017-01-16T19:49:33 <colinclark> seems like it should be pretty straightforward in that case, jhung
2017-01-16T19:51:40 <jhung> colinclark: ok. Sounds good.
2017-01-16T19:52:08 <colinclark> if you\'re stuck, we know luckily that gtirloni, avtar, and alanharnum all have skills in this regard, so we can figure something out
