2017-03-27T21:07:21 <Justin_o> colinclark, danayo: if you could let me know what those might be I have a JIRA for the work https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6117
2017-03-27T21:07:58 <colinclark> let you know what what might be, Justin_o? :)
2017-03-27T21:08:00 <colinclark> I\'m confused
2017-03-27T21:08:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: "modifying it in significant ways to best show what UIO is capable of"
2017-03-27T21:08:33 <Justin_o> what sort of significant modifications were you thinking of
2017-03-27T21:08:34 <colinclark> Well, I figured you\'d be the best person to tell me that! :)
2017-03-27T21:08:39 <colinclark> rather than the other way around
2017-03-27T21:09:17 <Justin_o> okay, i\'ll play around with it then to get it working with UIO
2017-03-27T21:09:34 <Justin_o> danayo: if you have anything you want removed / modified let me know as well..
2017-03-27T21:09:51 <Justin_o> i\'ll probably start looking into it this week, depending on how my PRs go
2017-03-27T21:11:06 <danayo> sounds good Justin_o

2017-03-27T16:40:36 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung, michelled: this is the updated NOAA page http://www.noaa.gov/resource-collections/climate-change-impacts
2017-03-27T16:40:57 <Justin_o> it\'s quite different from the one we used for the prefs framework demo
2017-03-27T16:41:08 <Justin_o> do you think it is still fitting for the demo?
2017-03-27T16:44:14 * Caren has quit
2017-03-27T16:45:35 * avtar has quit
2017-03-27T16:45:59 <jhung> Justin_o: I think our current demo is okay, but I think it can demonstrate some of the newer concepts such as dealing with SVGs, font icons, ignore-TOC flag, etc.
2017-03-27T16:46:24 <Justin_o> jhung: the problem with the existing demo is that it isn\'t responsive for mobile layouts
2017-03-27T16:46:40 <michelled> Justin_o: to answer your question from standup, I\'m fairly sure we used OER Commons to find a resource in the public domain https://www.oercommons.org/browse?batch_size=20&sort_by=title&view_mode=summary&f.subtopic=climate-change&f.cou_bucket=no-strings-attached

2017-03-27T16:53:39 <danayo> Justin_o: not sure about NOAA page - I suppose with the banner up top, changes made with UIO may be less obvious
2017-03-27T16:54:11 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, so perhaps something else then
2017-03-27T16:54:16 <danayo> (also have you noticed that the sidebar behaviour seems inconsistent?)
2017-03-27T16:57:33 <Justin_o> danayo: i think the first click expands. clicking when expanded will navigate you to the new page
2017-03-27T16:57:47 <Justin_o> it\'s a bit confusing that some of the options don\'t have an icon
2017-03-27T16:58:42 <danayo> yeah, i find it a little odd Justin_o
2017-03-27T16:59:33 <Justin_o> danayo: i don\'t like the thing that pops out of the bottom
2017-03-27T16:59:40 * avtar joined the channel
2017-03-27T16:59:41 <Justin_o> of the page, when you scroll to the bottom
2017-03-27T17:00:06 <danayo> yeah- you mean the footer that slides in Justin_o ?
2017-03-27T17:00:35 <Justin_o> yes, i\'m not exactly sure what it is, it almost seems like a  dialog, but i\'m not sure
2017-03-27T17:01:44 <danayo> it takes you to the home page! seems strange

2017-03-27T17:08:48 <colinclark> I haven\'t been able to completely confirm it, but it\'s highly likely that NOAA educational resources are in the public domain
2017-03-27T17:08:53 <colinclark> as is most of their content
2017-03-27T17:09:11 <colinclark> so it\'s possible that we could very significantly modify this into our own awesome resource

2017-03-27T17:32:45 <danayo> ok michelled
2017-03-27T17:54:37 <cindyli> danayo, jhung, i wonder if you would have some time this afternoon to help me with an idea of generating table of contents for general websites?
2017-03-27T17:55:08 <cindyli> would be nice if we can vidyo for probably 10-20 mins
2017-03-27T17:55:57 <jhung> cindyli: sure. After 2:30p?
2017-03-27T17:56:14 <cindyli> sure, jhung. thanks
2017-03-27T17:58:31 <Justin_o> jhung, lliskovoi, danayo: do you have any sites that you have designed or really like that you could send to kathy_ and grass for inspiration.
2017-03-27T17:58:55 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: also, could you share some good colour pickers / pallets that they could use
2017-03-27T17:59:52 <danayo> Justin_o: I think we had a bunch in the notes from one of our IDRC website brainstorming sessions
2017-03-27T18:00:52 <danayo> ok cindyli
2017-03-27T18:01:03 <Justin_o> danayo: that would be helpful
2017-03-27T18:01:11 <cindyli> thanks, danayo
2017-03-27T18:02:32 <danayo> jhung: do you recall where those notes are? from the IDRC website brainstorming? Justin_o was asking about websites we like and I know we had a list there
2017-03-27T18:05:35 <jhung> danayo: check the design crit page maybe? I\'m in a meeting atm, so I can\'t easily look.

2017-03-27T20:45:37 <Justin_o> colinclark, danayo: regarding the NOAA site, if it is considered a US Government Work i think it would fall under this https://www.usa.gov/government-works
2017-03-27T20:46:23 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s my impression
2017-03-27T20:46:33 <colinclark> but it\'s possible that it was created by a third-party in some cases
2017-03-27T20:47:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes this point in the exceptions "Not all information that appears on U.S. government websites is considered to be a U.S. government work."
