2017-12-05T14:53:44 <jhung> fluid-everyone: there will not be a design crit today. Let me know if there's anything for next week's crit.
2017-12-05T14:54:22 <jhung> Also I will be away next Tuesday - so someone will have to run the crit if there's a topic.
2017-12-05T15:19:56 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: would you have time to make an icon for the UIO+?

2017-12-05T18:05:42 <jhung> ^ grrrero
2017-12-05T18:05:44 <grrrero> jhung: Sure!
2017-12-05T18:36:42 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2017-12-05T18:39:29 <jhung> grrrero: I'm ready now
2017-12-05T18:39:34 <grrrero> Ok!
2017-12-05T19:09:05 <grrrero> Hey jhung: I got querying sticky notes of specific categories to work
2017-12-05T19:09:15 <jhung> \\o/
2017-12-05T19:09:19 <grrrero> Hahahhaha
2017-12-05T19:09:26 <grrrero> So we just have to make sure that the categories are properly set
2017-12-05T19:09:39 <grrrero> i.e. training/manual/documentation
2017-12-05T19:10:01 <jhung> Yes. Categories are key in all of this.
2017-12-05T19:10:04 <grrrero> For sure
2017-12-05T19:11:21 <jhung> The one thing that will happen is that posts in categories will show up in the sidebar when viewing that Category's landing page. This may or may not be what the user intends grrrero.
2017-12-05T19:11:39 <grrrero> Right jhung
2017-12-05T19:12:08 <jhung> If it's a problem it should be added to a list of future fixes. Right now the sidebar just queries all the posts in a category and lists them.
2017-12-05T19:12:24 <grrrero> Alright, will keep doing tests jhung
2017-12-05T19:12:54 <jhung> awesome grrrero!
2017-12-05T19:13:03 <grrrero> I'm probably gonna go back to furnishing the UI
2017-12-05T19:13:18 <grrrero> I've got my to-do list :) jhung
2017-12-05T19:13:44 <jhung> lol I understand completely. :)
2017-12-05T19:34:26 <michelled> danayo: can we meet at 3:00?
2017-12-05T19:35:16 <danayo> I'm fine with that michelled if it works for alanharnum and gmoss
2017-12-05T19:35:44 <gmoss> michelled alanharnum danayo works for me! just need a bit of food at the moment :)
2017-12-05T19:36:21 <alanharnum> it works, everyone is getting food or otherwise attending to needs :)

2017-12-05T20:43:02 <grrrero> jhung: Small victories... I've been able to code the (i.e.) Upcoming Workshops widget so they don't have to tinker with the content, it'll automatically fetch the latest (still testing that) sticky for that category.
2017-12-05T20:43:21 <grrrero> jhung: Just gotta figure out how to style it -- or if we can just make sure they format it properly when they create the post
2017-12-05T20:43:54 <jhung> grrrero: I think it's okay if they use the WYSIWYG editor to format.
2017-12-05T20:44:09 <grrrero> Yeah but the widget gets it w/o styling
2017-12-05T20:44:13 <grrrero> ^jhung
2017-12-05T20:44:22 <grrrero> So it removes any <p>s
2017-12-05T20:44:27 <jhung> Ah.
2017-12-05T20:44:57 <grrrero> It's a small thing but the small things get to me :)
2017-12-05T20:45:20 <jhung> It's that 20% that takes 80% of the time.
2017-12-05T20:45:26 <grrrero> Yes!!
2017-12-05T20:46:05 <jhung> I think for now we can document it and train. If it becomes a serious usability issue then we can revisit it.
2017-12-05T20:46:12 <grrrero> Ok!
