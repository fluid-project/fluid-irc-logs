2017-01-19T18:27:04 <Justin_o> danayo: is there a wiki page that links in all of the most current responsive UIO designs?
2017-01-19T18:36:52 * michelled joined the channel
2017-01-19T18:37:02 <Justin_o> danayo: also, added the tasks to the iteration page ( https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan ). Will need to update some of the JIRA with updated links to the wireframes. I could like to the designs directly, but thought it might be better to link to a  wiki page. let me know what you think.

2017-01-19T20:37:41 <Justin_o> danayo: oh okay, i see.. and the page itself sort of has the history of the various designs
2017-01-19T20:38:05 <danayo> yes, I think it's a little confusing tho, just going about to reorganize slightly Justin_o
