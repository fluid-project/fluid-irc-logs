2017-11-28T14:43:20 <alanharnum> a heads-up that we've got ET group coming in to look at the collab room at 10AM, so it won't be usable for design crit
2017-11-28T14:43:23 <alanharnum> jhung ^
2017-11-28T14:44:31 <simonjb> alanharnum: do you know if vidyo will be operational?
2017-11-28T14:44:51 <alanharnum> simonjb: vidyo should be fine, these are some issues with the room hardware
2017-11-28T14:45:03 <simonjb> cool, thanks alanharnum

2017-11-28T14:46:58 <jhung> thanks alanharnum.
2017-11-28T14:47:41 <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit will start in 12 minutes and we will not have access to the collaboration room. So we will have to login from our stations.
2017-11-28T14:48:29 <jhung> today we are talking about the Learning Differences entry for the Inclusive Learning Design Handbook: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8V1yLR3Qga_LENFW8KZd3b-93ibNEKXQDQiWcWfaDk/edit#

2017-11-28T15:09:25 <alanharnum> is anyone else having trouble connecting to Vidyo? Trying to log on from my laptop while I'm waiting for the tech in the collab room
2017-11-28T15:10:57 <michelled> alanharnum: sepi had issues and had to restart her computer
2017-11-28T15:14:46 <alanharnum> fluid_everyone: ETG tech has cancelled the visit today, we can use the collab room if we want to move in here

2017-11-28T20:53:01 <grrrero> jhung: I think I can further extend the widgets so that we're not manually creating Text widgets within the containers :D
2017-11-28T20:53:30 <grrrero> Reading up on it some more
2017-11-28T20:53:35 <jhung> Yeah? Awesome grrrero.
2017-11-28T20:53:58 <grrrero> Yaaa and make em a bit more flexible too
2017-11-28T20:54:26 <jhung> I feel like widgets would be so useful for some of the things I'm doing for BIG IDeA. Future improvement I guess.
2017-11-28T20:54:42 <grrrero> Yeah I think they definitely help
2017-11-28T20:54:52 <grrrero> Instead of hard-coding or creating  very long workflows
2017-11-28T20:55:04 <grrrero> If this turns out successful we can apply it to the a11y theme too
2017-11-28T20:55:18 <jhung> Awesome.
