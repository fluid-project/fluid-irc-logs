2017-11-14T15:01:28 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i kind of love this thread on the community list re: art \xe2\x80\x94 thanks for sharing your thoughts. i too enjoy knowing more about the context of pieces. I find myself using wikipedia or google in museums to understand time and culture to try to contextualize pieces
2017-11-14T15:04:05 <sepidehshahi> I think if we learn how to describe art, it will be one of the things we will refer to it in the future and say, this was first produced for people with disability and then it benefited all Jess_
2017-11-14T15:05:19 <Jess_> exactly! sepidehshahi i too share your and Pina\xe2\x80\x99s interests \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a rich place to find some great solution. And like you said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great curb cut!
2017-11-14T15:06:08 <sepidehshahi> yes!

2017-11-14T19:28:14 <simonjb> looks like "fluid.logLevel" was replaced by "evel"
2017-11-14T19:28:19 <jhung> simonjb: thanks. Looks like a search and replace gone bad.
2017-11-14T19:28:34 <simonjb> I\'ll file a JIRA now
2017-11-14T19:28:40 <jhung> ok thanks simonjb
2017-11-14T19:34:59 <simonjb> jhung: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6224
2017-11-14T19:35:13 <simonjb> is that filed correctly?
2017-11-14T19:35:23 <simonjb> in terms of component?
2017-11-14T19:37:05 <jhung> thanks simonjb. that looks fine

2017-11-14T20:03:16 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: you reference http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/47402 in the P4A deliverable \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with this \xe2\x80\x94 where did it come from? colinclark perhaps you know?
2017-11-14T20:03:58 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: this is the paper that Carla wrote based on SP1 use model.
2017-11-14T20:04:09 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: oh geez, yes
2017-11-14T20:04:09 <colinclark> Co-authored by the world famous Jess Michelle!
2017-11-14T20:04:23 <Jess_> which also explain why it\xe2\x80\x99s co-authored by \xe2\x80\xa6 yes, as colinclark said
2017-11-14T20:04:27 <Jess_> and behind a paywall
2017-11-14T20:04:28 <sepidehshahi> unfortunately it\xe2\x80\x99s too expensive for me to buy and see what is in that paper :)
2017-11-14T20:04:37 <Jess_> lol
2017-11-14T20:04:42 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: touche
2017-11-14T20:05:07 <Jess_> i\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s 1/2 me and 1/2 michelled
2017-11-14T20:05:28 <sepidehshahi> I think carla sent the final draft to us, I can find it in my emails if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary
2017-11-14T20:05:50 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: ok, i\xe2\x80\x99m back to editing\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s going slowly, but happening \xe2\x80\x94 i wondered if there\xe2\x80\x99s a section i should write \xe2\x80\x94 focusing on how the work of SP1 has inspired other stuff, like we talked about with gregg
