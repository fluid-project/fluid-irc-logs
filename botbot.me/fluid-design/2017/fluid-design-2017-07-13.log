2017-07-13T15:06:08 <Jess_> lliskovoi: i\xe2\x80\x99m going to work on putting a few things together for Rogers this afternoon and will be in by the time the meeting happens \xe2\x80\x94 just so ya know
2017-07-13T15:07:04 <lliskovoi> sounds good Jess_! Do you think we need to meet before our meeting with them to go over things or should we all just meet at 3?
2017-07-13T15:07:46 <Jess_> let\xe2\x80\x99s all just meet at 3 \xe2\x80\x94 if i have something to share before then i\xe2\x80\x99ll ping you to run through it, but i like what you described yesterday \xe2\x80\x94 a conversation (which is what they also described)

2017-07-13T15:33:47 <danayo> Caren:  :(
2017-07-13T15:34:37 <Caren> sad face over here too, danayo
2017-07-13T15:35:18 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep trying but if it fails will send update via chat

2017-07-13T17:17:06 <danayo> alanharnum: for Activity I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking we could link to the Meetings Notes on the wiki, and maybe also the mailing list archive?
2017-07-13T17:18:26 <danayo> for Resources, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, the storytelling wiki page, the guides to action wiki page, maybe even MyL3 work...
2017-07-13T17:18:57 <danayo> and floeproject.org?

2017-07-13T17:31:00 <alanharnum> danayo: possibly also the ILDH and Guide?
2017-07-13T17:31:08 <danayo> for sure, yes!
2017-07-13T17:31:35 <alanharnum> i also think we should have something explicit about how youth groups in particular can join in and contribute, etc; not sure if that needs to be its own section or if we can have it as part of another section
2017-07-13T17:32:47 <danayo> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea
2017-07-13T17:33:43 <danayo> i think a separate section would be best - to really emphasize it
2017-07-13T17:33:56 <danayo> add a \xe2\x80\x9cjoin us\xe2\x80\x9d section?
2017-07-13T17:34:20 <danayo> I guess it could come under Partners, but would get lost, I think
2017-07-13T17:34:33 <danayo> or maybe in the About section?
2017-07-13T17:34:59 <michelled> would it be too busy to be its own section?
2017-07-13T17:35:04 <michelled> it does seem to be very key
2017-07-13T17:35:34 <danayo> yes michelled, i think so
2017-07-13T17:35:55 <danayo> but also can imagine an emphasized box on the About page, linking to the join us info on the wiki
2017-07-13T17:36:11 <danayo> i can try sketching both up to see
2017-07-13T17:36:14 <michelled> is the about page the landing page?
2017-07-13T17:36:40 <danayo> i believe so - alanharnum? i think it should be
2017-07-13T17:37:07 <alanharnum> danayo: yup - I'm deploying changes regularly to http://www.alanharnum.ca/sojustrepairit.org/index.html if you want to see latest.
2017-07-13T17:37:26 <alanharnum> an emphasized box on the About / landing page could work
2017-07-13T17:38:11 <danayo> thanks alanharnum, it\xe2\x80\x99s looking good!
2017-07-13T17:38:28 <danayo> i\xe2\x80\x99ll sketch somthing up now
2017-07-13T17:39:38 <danayo> are we going to stick with the single column on the About page alanharnum? I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with either for now
2017-07-13T17:39:57 <alanharnum> danayo: I've been leaving that for last, since doing a multi column arrangement is pretty easy
2017-07-13T17:40:34 <danayo> okk great. actually was thinking it would be good to have the Join Us box in a 2nd column to avoid having it disappear under the fold

2017-07-13T18:35:19 <danayo> alanharnum: also, was thinking the blobs look better if they come off the ripped paper header altogether, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the About page with Join Us box https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/NbYFRIDYImolBEZ
2017-07-13T18:35:41 <danayo> I added some bullet design too - a nice to have only :)
2017-07-13T18:36:41 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking contact us could link to anchor on wiki page with contact info

2017-07-13T19:24:46 <danayo> alanharnum, it\xe2\x80\x99s looking so great :) I was staring at the Partners page and thinking it would be good to make it really clear that those 2nd paragraphs are specifically about what each patner is doing on the SJRK project. I wonder if it would help to add subheadings of \xe2\x80\x9cAbout\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSocial Justice Repair Kit Work\xe2\x80\x9d for each one ?
2017-07-13T19:25:02 <alanharnum> danayo: good idea
2017-07-13T19:31:09 * pratik_r joined the channel
2017-07-13T19:35:22 <danayo> alanharnum: nice! just one change - for James/SMARTlab could you bump the \xe2\x80\x9cSJRK Work\xe2\x80\x9d header down one paragraph?
2017-07-13T19:36:03 <alanharnum> danayo: good catch - I actually meant to do that and then went into copy-paste automation mode :)
2017-07-13T19:41:37 <danayo> thanks alanharnum. i have another request - could you increase the spacing above the page headers, so that it\xe2\x80\x99s the same (or just slightly bigger) as the space that comes after them ?
2017-07-13T19:46:35 <alanharnum> danayo: between the page title heading and the nav bar, you mean?

2017-07-13T20:38:48 <danayo> nice
2017-07-13T20:38:52 <danayo> thanks for that tweak
2017-07-13T20:41:46 <danayo> alanharnum: just in case https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/cnuatNpI9O1hQiU
2017-07-13T20:42:10 <danayo> it\xe2\x80\x99s quite small and because of how i created it I can\xe2\x80\x99t scale it up - so if that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem definitely let\xe2\x80\x99s leave it out
2017-07-13T20:43:38 <alanharnum> danayo: that should be pretty easy - already using a custom list bullet, so should be able to swap this in rq
2017-07-13T20:43:50 <danayo> awesome
2017-07-13T20:44:10 <danayo> also alanharnum, I think we talked about this, but if we could make those top diagonal slash lines black, I would  be so happy :D
