2017-07-10T14:58:10 <jhung> hi fluid-everyone, is there anything you want to present at tomorrow\'s design crit?
2017-07-10T15:02:19 <danayo> jhung: not sure, I want to check in with alan about the SJRK website, it might be useful to discuss - can I let you know once I talk to him?
2017-07-10T15:04:02 * colinclark joined the channel

2017-07-10T15:26:09 <colinclark> i\'ve got that classic login issue iwth vidyo
2017-07-10T15:26:26 <colinclark> neo must have signed me out
2017-07-10T15:26:28 <colinclark> one sec

2017-07-10T15:27:50 <jhung> colinclark: ok. I\'m still using the old client. I wonder if that\'s the issue?
2017-07-10T15:27:55 <colinclark> dunno
2017-07-10T15:28:04 <colinclark> shouldn\'t be
2017-07-10T15:45:45 <jhung> colinclark: let me know when you\'d like to continue our convo.

2017-07-10T16:55:08 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-10T16:55:37 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-10T16:56:47 <jhung_away> danayo: ok. Sounds good. Currently there\'s nothing else, so we can end early if needed.
2017-07-10T16:56:57 <danayo> thanks jhung_away
2017-07-10T17:01:20 <Justin_o> danayo: what would you call the ui for the contrast adjuster, if we had to make a generic name for it?
2017-07-10T17:01:55 <danayo> Justin_o: you mean a user-facing label, right?
2017-07-10T17:02:42 <Justin_o> danayo: well, i mean the component itself, but if you had to say to someone, we want to design some other adjuster and it use this same type of ui.. for example how we  have switches, and textfield steppers, and etc.
2017-07-10T17:02:53 <danayo> ah
2017-07-10T17:03:17 <danayo> good question!
2017-07-10T17:03:40 * danayo is thinking
2017-07-10T17:04:34 <danayo> maybe \xe2\x80\x9cmulti-selector\xe2\x80\x9d ?
2017-07-10T17:07:05 <danayo> Justin_o ^
2017-07-10T17:07:53 <Justin_o> danayo: but you can only select one option at a time, i would think multi-selector would mean you can select multiple options at once.. kind of like a mutli-select drop down
2017-07-10T17:08:02 <danayo> yeah ...
2017-07-10T17:09:51 <danayo> maybe just \xe2\x80\x9cselector\xe2\x80\x9d Justin_o, or \xe2\x80\x9cpicker\xe2\x80\x9d ?
2017-07-10T17:10:19 <Justin_o> danayo: those are interesting
2017-07-10T17:10:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: what do you think of those
2017-07-10T17:11:56 <danayo> I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty typical to call these kinds of things colour-pickers https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/135757/screenshots/1052426/color_picker.png
2017-07-10T17:12:04 <danayo> so maybe the generic term could just be picker
2017-07-10T17:12:34 <Justin_o> danayo: so you are thinking that it should only be used for colour things, and then it becomes a simplified colour picker, or constrained one anyways
2017-07-10T17:13:13 <Justin_o> danayo, cindyli: maybe themePicker then?
2017-07-10T17:13:44 <danayo> I think it could be used for other things Justin_o
2017-07-10T17:13:59 <Justin_o> danayo:  you mean other than colours?
2017-07-10T17:14:42 <danayo> yes. for example, maybe a font style could be selected that way. trying to think of other things
2017-07-10T17:14:51 <danayo> theme may be generic enough
2017-07-10T17:15:21 <danayo> screen layout maybe
2017-07-10T17:15:46 <Justin_o> danayo: what do you mean by screen layout?
2017-07-10T17:16:12 <danayo> I was imagining a future option for screen layout - something like what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the wiki to open/close the sidebar, but with more options
2017-07-10T17:16:25 <Justin_o> ah okay
2017-07-10T17:16:32 <Justin_o> kind of like simplification in a way
2017-07-10T17:16:34 <danayo> we had something like that in the pMT I think
2017-07-10T17:16:35 <danayo> yes
2017-07-10T17:16:41 <danayo> much like simplification
2017-07-10T17:16:44 <danayo> still, I think themePicker works
2017-07-10T17:16:51 <danayo> for all of those
2017-07-10T17:17:00 <Justin_o> ah okay
2017-07-10T17:17:13 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-10T17:17:19 <danayo> wondering if there is an example we can come up with where \xe2\x80\x9ctheme\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense
2017-07-10T17:18:34 <Justin_o> danayo: i suppose it would have to be something with a list of options for which a drop down doesn\'t make more sense. Also it\'d have to have some sort of icon or "mini-preview" as well
2017-07-10T17:18:51 <danayo> yes, mini-preview is a good way to describe it
2017-07-10T17:19:41 <Justin_o> so i could think of sounds for sonification or voices for text to speech, but i\'m not sure they\'d actually fit into this widget anyways, and may work better in a dropdown
2017-07-10T17:20:18 <danayo> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6could be interesting in some cases - for example, icons of different instruments
2017-07-10T17:20:56 <danayo> but i agree, dropdown would work best in many cases
2017-07-10T17:21:01 <danayo> voices for example
2017-07-10T17:21:11 <danayo> and other sonification sounds
2017-07-10T17:22:21 <Justin_o> icons for instruments is a good point
2017-07-10T17:22:32 <danayo> oh and I remember what we had in the PMT - it was to select the location of the magnifier window
2017-07-10T17:22:44 <danayo> we had visual icons on buttons
2017-07-10T17:23:55 <danayo> though when I think of it now, if you need magnification, those icons may be difficult to see
2017-07-10T17:24:24 <Justin_o> ha, that\'s a good point.. i hadn\'t though about that... although perhaps the magnification would be on, but just not in the form you want
2017-07-10T17:24:31 <danayo> right
2017-07-10T17:24:40 <Justin_o> magnification is one of those ones that can easily break your ability to use it though, if it\'s not set properly
2017-07-10T17:24:48 <danayo> for sure!
2017-07-10T17:25:40 <danayo> my cat likes to turn on my magnifier window - took me a while to find the key cut to turn it off!
2017-07-10T17:28:24 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-10T17:30:25 <danayo> alanharnum: I was thinking it might be good to have brief summaries of each of the partner\xe2\x80\x99s work plans on the site
2017-07-10T17:30:43 <danayo> I can write them up
2017-07-10T17:31:15 <alanharnum> danayo: I like that idea - capsule summaries with links to the greater details in the wiki pages?
2017-07-10T17:31:32 <danayo> that sounds good
2017-07-10T17:31:56 <alanharnum> so we use http://sojustrepairit.org/ as essentially a portal / summary, a more outsider-friendly survey of the project & where it\'s going
2017-07-10T17:32:10 <danayo> yeah
2017-07-10T17:32:32 <danayo> i wonder about the meeting minutes - they reflect some good discussion and progress - maybe we could link directly to them individually, or ?
2017-07-10T17:33:56 <jhung> danayo: for tomorrow\'s crit, are there any links?
2017-07-10T17:36:08 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-07-10T17:36:26 <alanharnum> danayo: is there a listing page for them on the wiki that we could link to instead? I see them under "Meeting Notes" on the main wiki page. Perhaps something like "latest meeting notes"? I just worry a little about that page becoming crowded.
2017-07-10T17:37:25 <danayo> jhung: yes, we will be looking at this site/page http://sojustrepairit.org/ and thinking of how to best incorporate content from the wiki page here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit to reflect project progress
2017-07-10T17:37:52 <danayo> for sure alanharnum\xe2\x80\xa6let me think about that
2017-07-10T17:38:34 <danayo> I could create a separate wiki page for the meeting notes listing - is that what you mean alanharnum? - and we could link to that?
2017-07-10T17:39:58 <alanharnum> danayo: we can also anchor-link to the existing list like this: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit#SocialJusticeRepairKit-MeetingNotes
2017-07-10T17:44:39 <danayo> yes alanharnum, i find it a little unclear with the 2 columns though - maybe a separate page would be better, with a link from the main wiki page and a link from the site as well
2017-07-10T17:44:43 <danayo> that list will get long too
2017-07-10T17:44:59 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah, agree; it might be time to split out some of the sections from that entry page into their own sections.
2017-07-10T17:45:03 <danayo> for sure
2017-07-10T17:45:10 <danayo> i can do that
