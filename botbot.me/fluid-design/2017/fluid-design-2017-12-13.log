2017-12-13T15:13:56 <alanharnum> Justin_o: incorporated your changes from the floeproject news item PR: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/61
2017-12-13T15:14:25 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, was just looking at the e-mails.. if you think we should drop the CNAME now, we can do that.
2017-12-13T15:14:53 <alanharnum> Justin_o: it's not doing any harm, but it's also not necessary any more since the site is no longer GH pages hosted

2017-12-13T15:47:08 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay.. i guess we can just leave it there for now then

2017-12-13T17:08:14 <michelled> danayo: here's the wiki page that simonjb has been working on with software design patterns using Infusion: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/An+Infusion+Pattern+Language
2017-12-13T17:09:03 <michelled> it doesn't have UI design patterns in it, but I think we had thought it would be good to update the UI design patterns we had made in the early days of infusion
2017-12-13T17:09:30 <michelled> I can see how both design libraries would be useful for our communities
2017-12-13T17:10:04 <danayo> thanks michelled. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m still wondering how one relates to the other, if at all
2017-12-13T17:11:30 <michelled> I think they relate in a high level way - another way of showing different community members ways we do things - whether that be design or development
2017-12-13T17:12:47 <michelled> danayo: I think in terms of the specific software design patterns we were talking about yesterday, by following them as developers we enable the interface to be more flexible
