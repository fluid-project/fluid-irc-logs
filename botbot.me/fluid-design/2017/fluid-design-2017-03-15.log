2017-03-15T15:24:39 <Caren> jhung, hi! what is the time frame for PhET again? End of July? :-)
2017-03-15T15:27:23 <michelled> Caren: in what sense?
2017-03-15T15:27:46 <michelled> our funding goes to the end of July, but we should have shorter time frames for particular work
2017-03-15T15:32:24 <Caren> michelled: that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get at\xe2\x80\xa6a workback for workshoping/co-design
2017-03-15T15:33:24 <Caren> Potentially propose a couple of workshops\xe2\x80\xa6in situ and online, if doable
2017-03-15T15:53:43 <michelled> Caren, sorry, I got the date wrong - it\'s end of June
2017-03-15T15:54:40 <Caren> ok, thanks michelled :-)
2017-03-15T15:55:54 * avtar joined the channel
2017-03-15T15:57:57 <jhung> Caren: I think the bulk of the design and research should be done well before that deadline. We should try to leave space for development or unexpected stuff that pops up.
2017-03-15T15:58:35 <Caren> jhung: aim for April for workshops?
2017-03-15T15:58:52 <jhung> I\'m thinking early / mid May would be a good time. It would give a good idea of what we can accomplish before the end of the grant.
2017-03-15T15:59:23 <jhung> *early / mid May for wrapping up design work, so mid april for workshops sounds about right Caren
2017-03-15T16:02:53 <Caren> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99m around to chat when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready

2017-03-15T16:05:06 <Justin_o> danayo:  did you put up the updated mockups for the switch and stepper adjusters?
2017-03-15T16:06:18 <jhung> Justin_o: the preserveAspectRatio attribute for SVGs, does it take a value? I just include it on the <svg> element right?
2017-03-15T16:06:42 <Justin_o> jhung: it does take values
2017-03-15T16:07:08 <Justin_o> jhung: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio
2017-03-15T16:07:53 <Justin_o> jhung: you\'d probably want some align option with "meet"
2017-03-15T16:08:01 <jhung> I\'ve been looking at that doc, but it\'s not clear to me how I\'d use it (no examples).
2017-03-15T16:08:14 <Justin_o> like preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
2017-03-15T16:08:33 <jhung> ok thanks Justin_o
2017-03-15T16:08:48 <Justin_o> yah the lack of examples is unfortunate
2017-03-15T16:09:23 <Justin_o> jhung: you might also be able to set those in the <svg> element you use on the page, instead of in the external svg you are pulling in
2017-03-15T16:09:57 <jhung> ah. Good point Justin_o
2017-03-15T16:11:38 <Justin_o> if that works, it\'ll provide more flexibility for use
