2017-08-16T15:07:58 <Caren> hi, jhung.
2017-08-16T15:08:05 <jhung> hey Caren.
2017-08-16T15:10:02 <Caren> do you know if there are notes from the PhET meeting with the pedagogy and sonification folks. The meeting where everyone liked the idea of adding track pieces to ESP.
2017-08-16T15:10:44 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m documenting the evolution and thinking behind the track pieces idea
2017-08-16T15:15:02 <Caren> and wondered if there was a document similar to our Accessibility google doc notes
2017-08-16T15:23:10 <jhung> Caren: are you talking about that one special meeting we had with the broader PhET team (which included Ariel and Kathy)?
2017-08-16T15:23:26 <Caren> yes, that one.
2017-08-16T15:23:38 <jhung> I don't have anything from that meeting aside from this slide deck I put together for that meeting: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XRvSG8Ghe_YLiHngQpy2qk0omFil4Q6ZT3aFfD49UZo/edit#slide=id.p
2017-08-16T15:23:56 <jhung> I also have notes in my brain Caren\xe2\x80\xa6. which isn't publicly accessible. :P
2017-08-16T15:27:43 <Caren> haha. me too. If you like I can integrate your \xe2\x80\x9cbrain notes\xe2\x80\x9d. Send me a point form email if you like.
2017-08-16T15:27:54 <Caren> thanks for the link :-)
2017-08-16T15:29:26 <jhung> sure. I'll send it in an email Caren. It will be synthesized to the wiki right?
2017-08-16T15:29:59 <Caren> yes, eventually. I\xe2\x80\x99m crafting it first.
2017-08-16T15:32:36 <jhung> Awesome thanks.
