2017-06-13T17:18:52 <Justin_o> danayo: hello, sorry, i\'m just seeing your message now
2017-06-13T17:18:58 <Justin_o> did you get that sorted out?
2017-06-13T17:23:03 <danayo> Hi Justin_o: sorry, that last "Justin" was courtesy of my cat stepping on the keyboard!
2017-06-13T17:23:07 <danayo> I realised it\'s a problem with iCalendar, because Google calendar seems to be fine
2017-06-13T17:23:22 <danayo> I added that meeting on Thurs with google cal - you should see it now
2017-06-13T17:23:39 <danayo> don\'t know what\'s up with iCalendar or how to fix it
2017-06-13T17:23:55 <Justin_o> danayo: yes i see that one now
2017-06-13T17:24:09 <Justin_o> did you want to pair quickly to look at your ical
2017-06-13T17:24:17 <danayo> sure!
2017-06-13T17:24:17 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure i can help, but can give it a shot
2017-06-13T17:24:23 <Justin_o> skype or vidyo?
2017-06-13T17:24:29 <Justin_o> call me with whichever when you\'re ready

2017-06-13T18:09:52 <jhung> fluid-everyone: having technical issues with Vidyo recently. Audio getting cut. Random logoffs. Anyone else experiencing similar?
2017-06-13T18:14:14 <clown> jhung, michelled (sitting beside me) says "yes"
2017-06-13T18:15:58 <danayo> jhung: today I experienced a random freeze of audio and video for about 3 sec
2017-06-13T18:16:20 <danayo> and i\'ve had some trouble with audio cutting out a bit too
2017-06-13T18:21:17 <michelled> jhung: this morning I lost audio several times, but since Justin sits behind me it didn\'t really matter
2017-06-13T18:31:24 <clown> jhung, my vidyo problem is not audio, but that the video is about 10 seconds behind the audio.
2017-06-13T18:31:43 <clown> I hear, "this shows that \xe2\x80\xa6", but there nothing on screen that corresponds. :(

2017-06-13T20:05:55 <jhung> thanks danayo, clown, michelled. I\'ll send out an email tomorrow if the problem continues. I had to use Cisco WebEx instead of Vidyo\xe2\x80\xa6 :(
2017-06-13T20:19:15 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: one component of vidyo is down, but it\'s only responsible for interfacing with "legacy" devices like polycom/h323 teleconference stuff.. i think that shouldn\'t impact regular vidyo calls. in any case, i\'ve just restarted all vidyo servers.. if the issue continues, please let me know
2017-06-13T20:24:46 <jhung> thanks gtirloni!
