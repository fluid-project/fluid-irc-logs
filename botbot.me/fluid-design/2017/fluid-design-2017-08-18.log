2017-08-18T14:11:52 <jhung> hi Caren. For today\'s PhET meeting I won\'t have much to report upon. If you have anything, please chime up. :)
2017-08-18T14:12:35 <Justin_o> Caren: just got your e-mail about the wiki, did you want to chat on vidyo or Skype quickly. I have a meeting at 10:30 but am free before then
2017-08-18T14:15:28 <Caren> jhung: last week I sent Emily an email letting her know I was updating the wiki and included a link for hr. I had another meeting that pulled me away from the 11am. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything other than continuing to summarize findings :-)
2017-08-18T14:16:09 <jhung> ok. Sounds good Caren. That\'s more than what I\'ve been able to do in the past week. :)
2017-08-18T14:17:14 <Caren> Justin_o: sure. I\xe2\x80\x9dll open my Vidyo room
2017-08-18T14:17:31 <Caren> except I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into my Vidyo. Ugh.
2017-08-18T14:19:25 <Justin_o> Caren: you can\'t log into vidyo?
2017-08-18T14:20:38 <Caren> no, for some reason it won\xe2\x80\x99t accept my password.
2017-08-18T14:20:50 <Justin_o> :(

2017-08-18T14:50:46 <Caren> Justin_o: do you happen to know how to direct the template I\xe2\x80\x99m creating in the wiki to save under the Projects heading?
2017-08-18T14:51:21 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-18T14:51:55 <Justin_o> Caren: you mean you want it to be in the left nav?
2017-08-18T14:53:32 <Justin_o> Caren: if that\'s the case, you\'d just need to update this page ( https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Navigation ) with a link in the Projects list.
2017-08-18T14:54:42 <Caren> Ah, brilliant. Thanks Justin_o
2017-08-18T14:54:58 <Justin_o> Caren: np :)

2017-08-18T15:08:29 <jhung> Justin_o:  do you think you can jump into the PhET meeting for a question?
2017-08-18T15:16:38 <jhung> PhET is wondering if it\'s reasonable to drop IE11/JAWS from testing / support.
2017-08-18T15:17:12 <jhung> Instead adopting FF / JAWS (Freedom Scientific is recommending JAWS users to migrate)
2017-08-18T15:19:40 <Justin_o> sorry, missed that
2017-08-18T15:19:52 <jhung> The general consensus is to drop IE11 / JAWS. The hesitation is that the migration away from IE11 is slow.
2017-08-18T15:20:07 <Justin_o> jhung: did you still need me in the meeting, or should i answer here
2017-08-18T15:20:23 <jhung> You can answer here Justin_o
2017-08-18T15:20:50 <Justin_o> basically, i don\'t know, but if Freedom scientific is recommending that its users are migrate, i don\'t suppose you\'ll be getting many if any bug fixes for it.
2017-08-18T15:21:02 <Justin_o> i\'ve been wondering if/when we should drop IE 11 support for infusion
2017-08-18T15:21:30 <Justin_o> the last time i looked, it didn\'t look like we could yet, but if many/most people have or will migrate to windows 10, it\'s probably fine to
2017-08-18T15:22:31 <Justin_o> jhung: according to this, seems that IE 11 is the most used MS browser https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php
2017-08-18T15:22:48 <Justin_o> but it\'s a small percentage.. i suppose it may be more interesting to know what those stats are for AT users
2017-08-18T15:23:01 <Justin_o> for this particular question
2017-08-18T15:25:25 <jhung> Justin_o: exactly. I don\'t know what those stats are like. From experience, it did seem majority of JAWS users also used IE\xe2\x80\xa6 but that\'s just based on personal encounters.
2017-08-18T15:26:28 <Justin_o> jhung: this is from 2 years ago http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6/
2017-08-18T15:27:12 <Justin_o> I think that\'s traditionally been the case that IE and JAWS tended to go together.. so it\'s interesting that freedom scientific is suggesting moving away from using it
2017-08-18T15:27:23 <Justin_o> although there have been lots of changes there recently
2017-08-18T15:28:03 <jhung> I found this, but need $5k to see it. http://www.decisiondatabases.com/ip/15431-assistive-technologies-for-visual-impairment-market-analysis-report
2017-08-18T15:28:14 <Justin_o> ;(
2017-08-18T15:39:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-08-18T15:39:30 <jhung> Caren: Do you think this is a good way of asking what Emily is looking for\xe2\x80\xa6 "Does anyone know of research or work done by an organization which tracks blind student trajectory through K-12 (and beyond) with respect to STEM persistence?"
2017-08-18T15:40:00 <jhung> Instead of "tracks" maybe I\'d say "studies"
2017-08-18T15:42:22 <danayo> grrrero: I think jhung will have more feedback about the repo itself. I took a quick look at the wiki page again and it\'s looking really great. I\'m going to try going through the process step by step and see how it goes!
2017-08-18T15:42:24 <Caren> or \xe2\x80\x9cfollows\xe2\x80\x9d. And maybe low vision and blind?
2017-08-18T15:42:34 <Caren> jhung^
2017-08-18T15:42:39 <grrrero> danayo: Awesome, thank you!
2017-08-18T15:43:19 <jhung> Caren: Yes. Good point.
2017-08-18T15:43:41 <Caren> follows the trajectory of low vision and blind student\xe2\x80\xa6..it\xe2\x80\x99s good!
2017-08-18T15:43:59 <Caren> it\xe2\x80\x99s good, jhung
2017-08-18T15:44:07 <jhung> Awesome. I was going to send out an email to the Community mailing list.
2017-08-18T15:44:19 <alanharnum> colinclark danayo: should we chat about BiT now?
2017-08-18T15:44:31 <colinclark> ha, duelling channels
2017-08-18T15:44:34 <colinclark> sure, now is good
2017-08-18T15:44:47 <alanharnum> colinclark danayo: unlocked room
2017-08-18T15:46:23 <Caren> excellent idea, jhung. thanks :-)
2017-08-18T16:08:35 <Caren> everyone: there is now a Project Template for new projects on the wiki. It is modeled after the project page for SJRK. Enjoy and send all and any feedback. d:)
2017-08-18T16:11:42 <colinclark> that\'s awesome, Caren!
2017-08-18T16:12:42 <Caren> thanks to Justin_o, danayo et al for the help\xe2\x80\xa6what a team <3
2017-08-18T16:13:18 <Justin_o> Caren: :)
2017-08-18T16:14:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: do you know if we have statistics for browser usage by AT? For example do screen reader users prefer IE 11 vs FF and etc. Has GPII captured any of that info?
2017-08-18T16:18:02 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-18T16:26:02 <colinclark> GPII has not, no
2017-08-18T16:26:14 <colinclark> I dont\' know if there is more recent data

2017-08-18T16:48:15 <colinclark> there\'s that screen reader survey
2017-08-18T16:48:31 <colinclark> i don\'t know how big the sample size is, but it typically documents combinations of browsers and AT

2017-08-18T16:49:14 <colinclark> yup, that\'s the one
2017-08-18T16:49:19 <colinclark> wow, i can\'t believe it\'s been that long
2017-08-18T16:49:22 <colinclark> oh well
2017-08-18T16:49:45 <Justin_o> yah... i know, i thought it would have been from at least last year

2017-08-18T20:23:56 <colinclark> I love it, of course\xe2\x80\x94such a great diagram
2017-08-18T20:24:47 <colinclark> One piece of not-very-useful advice might be to give the things that are currently triangles more of a shape that reflects their flexibility, agility, adaptability
2017-08-18T20:25:02 <colinclark> but they\'re pretty cool as is
2017-08-18T20:25:11 <Caren> haha, np. The nautical theme!
2017-08-18T20:25:20 <colinclark> :)
2017-08-18T20:25:23 <colinclark> I love the anchors
2017-08-18T20:25:31 <Caren> Good point\xe2\x80\xa6very pointy
2017-08-18T20:25:59 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-18T20:26:12 <colinclark> sometimes pointy is fast and good at cutting through waves :)
2017-08-18T20:26:22 <Caren> I made them a bit 3D to attempt more sense of dimension
2017-08-18T20:26:34 <Caren> and to contrast the curvy waves
2017-08-18T20:26:59 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99ll think more on that
2017-08-18T20:27:51 <Caren> thanks colinclark, have a great holiday
2017-08-18T20:28:13 <colinclark> the 3D-ishness is a great effect
