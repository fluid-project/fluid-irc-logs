2017-04-07T15:50:25 <jhung> colinclark: I think I came off a bit strong. If you want to join the hackathon as a participant, I think that\'s cool. But I wonder if your knowledge of PhET may be a bias. Is that desirable? I\'m not quite sure.

2017-04-07T16:07:44 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-04-07T16:07:47 <colinclark> I wasn\'t offended
2017-04-07T16:08:40 <colinclark> I\'m fascinated, though, by this idea of "bias"
2017-04-07T16:09:30 <colinclark> wouldn\'t it make sense to structure the workshop in a way that takes advantage of the different strengths of knowing a lot about PhET and not knowing a lot about it?
2017-04-07T16:10:55 <colinclark> again, in that co-design sense of collaborating instead of sweating the "objectivity" of research

2017-04-07T16:55:30 <jhung> colinclark: that\'s a very good point about collaboration and objectivity. Perhaps "bias" isn\'t the right word, but maybe "unintentionally influence" is what I\'m getting at? But maybe that\'s the point. Having experts involved in the co-design is fine since it helps other participants to consider different perspectives.

2017-04-07T18:00:37 <colinclark> jhung: yup, exactly
2017-04-07T18:00:49 <colinclark> I think it\'s worth thinking about exactly how these networks of influence in a design practice work
2017-04-07T18:01:22 <colinclark> and try to create environments in which they can be emphasized, rather than trying to restrain them by drawing "us" and "them" lines
2017-04-07T18:03:30 <colinclark> not that I\'m saying you\'re doing that, but just that it\'s easy to fall in the "contextual inquiry" mindset, instead of thinking through collaborative situations in which people with varying knowledge, skills, and experience are interacting
