2017-01-25T15:11:07 <simonjb> hi danayo
2017-01-25T15:11:36 <danayo> hello simonjb
2017-01-25T15:11:42 <simonjb> danayo: I was thinking a little more yesterday about our discussion about cookies
2017-01-25T15:12:25 <simonjb> and the difference between data stored in a cookie and the cookie being an identifier used to access data stored elsewhere
2017-01-25T15:14:07 <simonjb> one practical difference in terms of a user\'s actions, would be that deleting a cookie would not remove user\'s information, if the cookie is an identifier used to relate to data stored remotely
2017-01-25T15:14:20 <simonjb> it would only remove that association
2017-01-25T15:14:23 <danayo> good point simonjb
2017-01-25T15:14:43 <simonjb> and another association could easily be added in the future
2017-01-25T15:14:57 <simonjb> the personal data persists on a remote server
2017-01-25T15:15:17 <danayo> yeah, I was just wondering about that simonjb - whether it could be associated with that user at a later time
2017-01-25T15:15:25 <simonjb> definitely
2017-01-25T15:16:03 <simonjb> I was thinking that we don\'t want to give the impression that all the data is on the user\'s computer, in cookies
2017-01-25T15:16:16 <simonjb> and that they can control that data
2017-01-25T15:16:29 <simonjb> say, by deleting all their cookies
2017-01-25T15:16:31 <danayo> yes, definitely
2017-01-25T15:16:52 <danayo> there\'s no way of ever removing that data on the server, is there
2017-01-25T15:17:03 <danayo> at the moment
2017-01-25T15:18:31 <simonjb> in depends on the persons managing the remote server -- now transparent they are, if they give you the option -- but in general no, there is no way
2017-01-25T15:19:36 <simonjb> it\'s out of your direct control -- it\'s managed by the remote server

2017-01-25T15:26:04 * Caren has quit
2017-01-25T15:26:36 <simonjb> np danayo
2017-01-25T15:27:11 <danayo> not sure if you saw my last few comments - about whether it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to remove the data from the server
2017-01-25T15:28:21 <simonjb> danayo: yes, I think so (https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-design)
2017-01-25T15:28:46 <danayo> thanks :)
2017-01-25T15:28:50 <simonjb> in general, no it\'s not possible to remove -- it\'s out of the direct control of the user
2017-01-25T15:29:37 <danayo> ok simonjb. this is so interesting - with respect to what one\xe2\x80\x99s privacy preferences could be
2017-01-25T15:29:38 <simonjb> a remote server manager might give you the option to remove stuff or to see what data is stored about you but it\'s in their control
2017-01-25T15:30:44 <danayo> ok
2017-01-25T15:30:58 <danayo> This is very helpful, simonjb, thanks!
2017-01-25T15:31:31 * Yan_Hu has quit
2017-01-25T15:32:42 <danayo> I was thinking that the privacy preferences might be: delete all cookies now (remove association) / never allow cookies in future (or only with trusted sites) / somehow block future associations? / see or remove server data where possible
2017-01-25T15:34:34 <danayo> simonjb ^
2017-01-25T15:35:31 <simonjb> danayo: are you familiar with the Do Not Track header? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track
2017-01-25T15:36:32 <danayo> right, thanks simonjb, I was familiar with the ability to set a \xe2\x80\x9cdo not track\xe2\x80\x9d option - so that would be another preference
2017-01-25T15:36:49 <simonjb> cool
2017-01-25T15:37:24 <danayo> so do not track would (if implemented) stop data from being shared with anyone other than the current site, is that right simonjb?
2017-01-25T15:41:36 <simonjb> danayo: it\'s a very good question (precisely what the do not track expression means)
2017-01-25T15:41:54 <simonjb> there\'s a W3C spec
2017-01-25T15:42:16 <simonjb> that defines "Tracking" as "the collection of data regarding a particular user\'s activity across multiple distinct contexts and the retention, use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside the context in which it occurred"
2017-01-25T15:42:27 <simonjb> https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#terminology.activity
2017-01-25T15:42:35 <simonjb> https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/
