2017-03-17T14:46:49 <michelled> jhung: I was just looking around the Floe part of the wiki and I found this: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Edify+Collaboration
2017-03-17T14:46:53 <michelled> it\'s really excellent!
2017-03-17T14:47:40 <jhung> michelled: thanks! :)
2017-03-17T14:48:04 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-03-17T14:48:10 <michelled> I\'m thinking we want to do something like that on an ongoing basis - to make our collaborations really clear
2017-03-17T14:48:18 <michelled> but of course, something that isn\'t too labour intensive
2017-03-17T14:48:24 <michelled> what do you think?
2017-03-17T14:48:32 <jhung> +1 michelled
2017-03-17T14:48:43 <michelled> do you have ideas for what that could look like?
2017-03-17T14:49:49 <jhung> I think under the workshops / collaborations landing page we can clean it up and present things better. We can then add more pages like that Edify one to that section.
2017-03-17T14:50:04 <jhung> Right now the landing page looks rather drab https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Workshop%2C+Consultations%2C+and+Integrations
2017-03-17T14:50:20 <jhung> Needs a little sparkle. Some pizazz.
2017-03-17T14:54:17 <michelled> oh yes! this is great and we need to link it to the Floe main wiki page more clearly
2017-03-17T14:54:23 <michelled> oh, and actually also from the website!
2017-03-17T14:54:51 <michelled> ah, I guess it\'s included in that main Floe wiki page
2017-03-17T14:54:59 <michelled> I know, we need to do some gardening.
2017-03-17T14:55:17 <michelled> anyway, I\'m really glad you are surfacing this work - this will be another thing we show off when TJ visits
2017-03-17T14:55:28 <jhung> Yeah. The main Floe page needs some reformatting.
2017-03-17T14:56:24 <jhung> I\'ll add a task to a jira and add it to the iteration plan page. I probably won\'t have time to create the new content until later this month or early April michelled
2017-03-17T14:57:02 <michelled> that\'s perfect jhung - thanks!
2017-03-17T15:04:44 <jhung> fluid-everyone: for Tuesday\'s design crit I was hoping to discuss the "gap" between co-design and the more formalized research approach. Does anyone else have anything they wish to talk about?
2017-03-17T15:06:11 <danayo> michelled, colinclark, jessm, alanharnum re: our MyL3 meeting yesterday - I\'d almost forgotten about this mapping that sepideh and I had begun - might be good to include in the narrative in some way (this one is focussed on a job centre scenario) https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1az9tQ6wE0ZkH5jBJfvG0vMAM-HygM9XWbAOPnXjjC-M/edit
2017-03-17T15:06:37 <colinclark> oh yes, that\'s a really good idea
2017-03-17T15:07:32 <alanharnum> danayo: definitely!

2017-03-17T15:09:59 <jhung> michelled: I was going to add a "TJ\'s Visit" section to the iteration plan page. That work for you?
2017-03-17T15:12:33 <michelled> jhung: perhaps we\'ll call it Hewlett meetings?
2017-03-17T15:12:36 <michelled> and yes!
2017-03-17T15:12:52 <jhung> michelled: that\'s better. :) I\'ll do that
2017-03-17T15:14:03 <jhung> danayo: do you have a minute? Justin_o updated his demo for the toggle switch.
2017-03-17T15:15:18 <danayo> sure jhung
2017-03-17T15:15:35 <jhung> danayo: Vidyo?
