2017-08-17T15:51:48 <jhung> danayo: I'll be out around that time. Is after 2:30pm ET okay for you? I can ping you when I'm back.
2017-08-17T15:53:29 <danayo> sure jhung, sounds good thanks
2017-08-17T16:00:17 <jhung> great danayo.

2017-08-17T16:10:16 <danayo> now that my internet issues are sorted out (hopefully!)

2017-08-17T16:18:04 <colinclark> tomorrow morning sounds great
2017-08-17T16:18:08 <colinclark> let's do 11 am
2017-08-17T16:19:15 <danayo> great colinclark! hope that works for alanharnum too
2017-08-17T16:20:17 <danayo> glad my connection seemed better colinclark - they realised they could point the dish at a much closer tower
2017-08-17T16:20:28 <danayo> after climbing a very large tree
2017-08-17T16:20:28 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-08-17T16:20:33 <colinclark> that's a good thing to realize
2017-08-17T16:20:36 <danayo> yeah
2017-08-17T16:20:41 <colinclark> forest living is tough!
2017-08-17T16:20:46 <danayo> haha
2017-08-17T16:21:15 <danayo> definitely a test this morning with maxed out video channels etc
2017-08-17T16:29:47 <colinclark> were you using the low bandwith feature on or off, danayo?
2017-08-17T16:31:08 <danayo> i had it set to highest quality
2017-08-17T16:32:11 <danayo> today that is, colinclark - previously i had been trying the low bandwidth setting
2017-08-17T16:32:29 <colinclark> amazing
2017-08-17T16:32:40 <colinclark> that's a pretty good test
2017-08-17T16:32:44 <danayo> yes!
2017-08-17T16:37:43 <jhung> Caren, we should suggest this for the next iteration of Balloons and Static Electricity https://i.imgur.com/TMdhxkm.gifv
2017-08-17T16:43:12 <danayo> omg jhung - love it
2017-08-17T16:43:18 <danayo> cat static!
2017-08-17T16:45:10 * michelled joined the channel
2017-08-17T16:45:46 <jhung> The first part of the game is to actually get the cat to get stuck balloons\xe2\x80\xa6 which could take a while because cats do whatever they want.
2017-08-17T16:49:14 <michelled> jhung: that's awesome!
2017-08-17T16:49:28 <michelled> I suspect my cat would bite it though, and then get scared
2017-08-17T16:51:50 <jhung> michelled: that's a good point. This could also be an opportunity to teach about surface tension and pressure. :D
2017-08-17T16:52:19 <jhung> (and to teach not to mess with cats for human amusement)
2017-08-17T16:53:18 <michelled> hahaha

2017-08-17T17:05:43 <Caren> very fun! jhung. I actually love the idea of a sim using a cat. Tho, it might promote unethical experiments at home\xe2\x80\x94haha https://imgur.com/TMdhxkm
2017-08-17T17:17:51 <Caren> simonjb: Here is a piece about the reMarkable Paper Tablet. Apparently it has a high-friction surface to emulate scribing on a substrate http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/remarkable-paper-tablet
2017-08-17T17:18:24 <simonjb> thanks Caren, I'll have a look
2017-08-17T17:19:49 <michelled> Caren: thanks for putting your platform co-op brochure on the wiki!
2017-08-17T17:20:02 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2017-08-17T17:20:18 <michelled> alanharn_:  I wonder if the graphic you put up for Jutta should be linked to it https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Platform+Cooperativism
2017-08-17T17:20:41 <michelled> or maybe we should have a platform co-op wiki landing page with links to both of these?
2017-08-17T17:21:19 <Caren> thanks, michelled. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how to make a wiki landing page. I mentioned it in standup last week but haven\xe2\x80\x99t followed up.
2017-08-17T17:21:44 <Caren> If someone could show me, I would be happy to do it.
2017-08-17T17:21:57 <michelled> danayo: is there a template we use for project landing pages on the wiki?
2017-08-17T17:22:53 <danayo> not that I know of michelled - but it would be good to have one!
2017-08-17T17:22:58 <danayo> I think this one is a good start https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit
2017-08-17T17:23:15 <michelled> yeah, that one looks great
2017-08-17T17:26:04 <michelled> alanharn_: when you have time, would you like to meet about SJRK?
2017-08-17T17:26:23 <grrrero> jhung or danayo: Where in ownCloud can I put the master .ai file in?
2017-08-17T17:26:53 <alanharn_> michelled: sure, maybe later this aft?
2017-08-17T17:30:09 <michelled> sure what time alanharn_?
2017-08-17T17:30:54 <alanharn_> michelled: say 3:30? gmoss and danayo should probably join us
2017-08-17T17:31:05 <danayo> grrrero: I think it would make sense to put it in the Inclusive Resources and Tools folder
2017-08-17T17:31:34 <grrrero> Ok should I put it in any of the subfolders or create its own folder?
2017-08-17T17:31:38 <grrrero> danayo ^
2017-08-17T17:31:39 <gmoss> alanharn_ michelled i'm available at 3:30!
2017-08-17T17:31:48 <danayo> yeah, i'm thinking the Design Templates folder makes sense grrrero
2017-08-17T17:31:54 <grrrero> Ok thanks danayo
2017-08-17T17:33:31 <danayo> michelled, alanharn_, gmoss I can meet at 3:30
2017-08-17T17:33:32 <danayo> just to clarify michelled - you want to talk about SJRK budgeting and FTE's etc, right?
2017-08-17T17:33:40 <michelled> yes danayo
2017-08-17T17:33:59 <michelled> not that I can help with that - but I just want to offer what I do know
2017-08-17T17:34:02 <michelled> in case it's useful

2017-08-17T19:18:44 <danayo> i'll take a look at that page and get feedback to you
2017-08-17T19:18:55 <jhung> danayo: anyway I think we were done. If you can take a look at that doc that would be great. There are two portions to the document. The first bit is more general explaining what it is. The second half is a little more technical explaining how to install and configure it.
2017-08-17T19:19:03 <danayo> cool
2017-08-17T19:19:07 <jhung> Thanks!

2017-08-17T19:51:50 <Caren> hello danayo, michelled, everyone. I\xe2\x80\x99ve dug in a bit to try and figure out how to create a template on the wiki. I attempted to duplicate the SJRK project page to no avail.
2017-08-17T19:51:55 <Caren> If I have it correct, Space Permission is needed to add a page/template at that level. Does anyone know if that is correct?
2017-08-17T19:52:41 <michelled> Justin_o: do you know?
2017-08-17T19:53:14 <Justin_o> i'm not sure, but i'll try to take a look
