2017-09-22T14:59:19 <gmoss> lliskovoi: that is so cool! I\'d love to live in a house made of these bricks (pumped full of insulating foam, of course). what a deceptively simple and fun idea
2017-09-22T15:01:06 <jhung> Jess_: yes, sounds good. I\'m away next week. Hopefully they can wait until I\'m back. Otherwise I can see if I can hop on for a call.
2017-09-22T15:01:45 <Jess_> jhung: well, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that urgent!
2017-09-22T15:01:46 <Jess_> :)
2017-09-22T15:02:07 <jhung> Jess_: noted. :)
2017-09-22T15:02:27 <Jess_> jhung: have a good week!

2017-09-22T15:24:54 <jhung> Jess_: asking the important questions!
2017-09-22T15:25:13 <Jess_> lol, always
2017-09-22T15:27:25 <jhung> Jess_: I\'ve never been to Applefest. I assume there will be apple fritters, not sure of the cider variety though. If not, then you should definitely suggest improvements! :)
2017-09-22T15:27:46 <jhung> I would +1 that right away

2017-09-22T16:12:00 <Jess_> 1. we\xe2\x80\x99re doing some chatting with Markham museum about an exhibit involving recent immigrants who go to unionville high school \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s called Due North and will involve mapping, etc. It\xe2\x80\x99s cool because the museum has acreage and buildings so the exhibit might be outside
2017-09-22T16:12:27 <Jess_> they said a lot of these kids also have mental health issues as they dissassociate from their core language and culture and \xe2\x80\x9cbecome Canadian"
2017-09-22T16:12:29 <Jess_> interesting
2017-09-22T16:12:44 <Jess_> also, was going to talk about displacement \xe2\x80\x94 and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Puerto Rico
2017-09-22T16:12:48 <Jess_> but i can skip that
2017-09-22T16:13:46 <Caren_> Jess_sounds interesting. Is the exhibit being curated/created by the students?
2017-09-22T16:15:46 <Jess_> yes
2017-09-22T16:15:58 <Jess_> the museum folks are working with teh art director from the hs
2017-09-22T16:18:59 <Caren_> very cool, Jess_
