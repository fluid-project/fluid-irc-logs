2017-11-24T14:04:28 <alanharnum> jhung: you are the person to ask about the CMHR IAD work, right?
2017-11-24T14:04:40 <jhung> yes alanharnum
2017-11-24T14:04:49 <jhung> and jessm.
2017-11-24T14:04:52 <alanharnum> what does the IAD in that stand for? :)
2017-11-24T14:05:38 <jhung> "Inclusive and Accessible Design"
2017-11-24T14:05:59 <jhung> They wrote a guide for their exhibit spaces which they want to publish as a CC resource.
2017-11-24T14:06:16 <jhung> Based off of the Smithsonian guide.
2017-11-24T14:07:10 <alanharnum> thanks!

2017-11-24T14:19:14 <grrrero> Hey jhung! I\'m trying to figure out how to make images in the panels appear before the text -- if ever this is not doable is having the images inline or after the header ok?
2017-11-24T14:25:53 <jhung> just in a meeting grrrero. I\'ll get back to you in a bit.
2017-11-24T14:25:58 <grrrero> Ok jhung!
2017-11-24T14:31:10 <alanharnum> fluid_everyone: per the email from yesterday, we\'re having some visitors around 11:30 from the Ministry of Canadian Heritage. I\'m going to be highlighting a few of our recent culture/heritage related projects, this is what I have so far: jhung\'s work with the Canadian Museum of Human Rights (and our previous work on their kiosks), jessm\'s work with the Ontario Museum Association, Bodies in Translation, the
2017-11-24T14:31:10 <alanharnum> SmartLab AR/VR equipment we\'re getting & some of our discussions about inclusive/accessible AR/VR.
2017-11-24T14:31:21 <alanharnum> can anyone think of anything else specific that would be worth mentioning?
2017-11-24T14:31:30 <alanharnum> during the probably 3-5 minutes I\'ll have them :)

2017-11-24T15:59:06 <alanharnum> gmoss: yes, that\'s a good one as well - they\'d be interested in that second one in particular
2017-11-24T16:05:36 <grrrero> alanharnum: Sorry I realise you\'re about to give your tour but was a consensus formed re: opening in new tabs or nah?
