2017-11-23T16:38:35 <jessm> fluid-everyone: i have to listen in to an event to make sure the audio is working\xe2\x80\xa6 so missing standup. I met with Jhung this a.m. about JD stuff, am meeting with Ather in a few minutes re: soccer project and am hoping that danayo has some time to connect today to catch up. otherwise i\xe2\x80\x99m doing procurement
2017-11-23T16:39:16 <alanharnum> colinclark: are you able to share that document more widely?

2017-11-23T16:47:53 <Caren_> ah, I missed standup. Had my head down in procurement! I would say that is my update. :-)
2017-11-23T16:50:38 <alanharnum> here\'s the conversation from late yesterday danayo mentioned: https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-design/2017-11-22/?msg=93824271&page=1, and here\'s my comment on the associated JIRA: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-43?focusedCommentId=37726&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-37726
2017-11-23T16:51:04 <alanharnum> i\'d be curious to hear the opinions of others on the "make external links open in new tabs / windows" issue

2017-11-23T21:12:04 <alanharnum> comic nerdery makes me think it looks more than anything else like one of prisons of the Dragon in Hellboy, but that\'s probably just me.
