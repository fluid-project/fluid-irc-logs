2017-06-21T15:33:26 <jhung> danayo: Firefox has released a privacy focused browser. https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/mozilla-brings-its-private-web-browser-firefox-focus-to-android/ I\'ve been using it and it\'s pretty good, but it doesn\'t have tabbed browsing yet.
2017-06-21T15:33:55 <danayo> cool jhung, thanks, I\'ll give it a try
2017-06-21T15:34:36 <jhung> It\'s not an anonymizer though. It just makes it harder to track, but not impossible.
2017-06-21T15:35:59 <jhung> The way I\'ve been using it is as the "default browser" on my phone to open unknown links. Then I would use the "Open in Firefox" feature once I\'ve checked out the link.

2017-06-21T16:22:11 <danayo> fluid-everyone: a new video game that looks really cool - "Everything is an open ended interactive experience and reality simulation game. There is no right or wrong way to play, and each person\'s game will be different. Playing Everything involves traveling through the Universe and seeing it from different points of view..." http://www.everything-game.com/features/

2017-06-21T17:00:46 <jhung> danayo: Justin_o sent a link this game before. It looks pretty cool!
2017-06-21T17:01:51 <danayo> ah, cool jhung
2017-06-21T17:03:30 <jhung> A game about perspective shifting? Sign me up! :)
2017-06-21T17:06:06 <danayo> I know, right? and it\'s so beautiful
2017-06-21T17:06:13 <danayo> I love the sounds too
2017-06-21T17:41:17 <gtirloni> "calmer" communication -- https://twistapp.com/  (it\'s pretty calm here, not suggesting we change anything.. just sharing for design curiosity :P)
2017-06-21T17:48:09 <danayo> thanks gtirloni: was just reading about how they compare it to Slack. "In Slack, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to go back to a full conversation. In Twist, conversations are always easily organized in threads."
2017-06-21T17:48:28 <danayo> "In Slack, you have to always be online or else miss important conversations. In Twist, you can take your time to work on your projects, then come back later to catch up on your threads."
2017-06-21T17:49:41 <danayo> kinda like email meets chat?
2017-06-21T17:50:11 <gtirloni> I participate in some pretty heavy used Slack teams for open source projects and I\'ll admit I just give up when I see the notification for unread messages. I just click "mark all as read"... most of them I don\'t know to read because it\'s people asking for help and others have responded.. but I don\'t know, I need to check it linearly. But if it\'s a project discussion I\'m involved in, I\'ll probably miss it
2017-06-21T17:50:21 <gtirloni> yeah, i think email meets chat meets wiki
2017-06-21T17:52:46 <gtirloni> maybe phpBB forum users may think it\'s just the same with a new UI.. could be. just thinking now
2017-06-21T17:59:02 <danayo> I\'ve only just started using Slack and only with a pretty small team. I can see how it could get out of hand with a lot of members and multiple conversations. Once in a while it happens here in IRC, but not much I\'d say, its seems pretty manageable. Helps to have multiple channels
2017-06-21T18:00:11 <gtirloni> yeah, agreed. And Slack\'s thread while not super well integrated, offer some separated space too

2017-06-21T18:25:41 <jessm> jhung: also, are the pages on the IDI in Git? I made edits to a page and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98take\xe2\x80\x99
2017-06-21T18:25:43 <jhung> interesting jessm.
2017-06-21T18:26:20 <jessm> jhung: i can try to fix deep if you can help fix IDI?
2017-06-21T18:26:21 <jhung> jessm: I think some of the pages are done directly in wordpress for the IDI site.
2017-06-21T18:26:39 <jhung> Sure jessm. I\'ll take a look.
2017-06-21T18:26:54 <jessm> so the \xe2\x80\x94 Workshops page needs to change
