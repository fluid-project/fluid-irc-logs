2017-11-20T14:34:20 <alanharnum> possibly of interest - i redesigned my personal site on the weekend as part of changing the static generator I was using, and am now using the latest mobile UIO: http://www.alanharnum.ca/ - so a "mobile UIO in the wild" example (sort of)
2017-11-20T14:36:38 <sepidehshahi> looks really good alanharnum
2017-11-20T14:37:33 <alanharnum> yeah i really love the new mobile UIO
2017-11-20T14:38:07 <alanharnum> and for all that I feel attachment to the sliders from the time I spent doing pure HTML sliders to replace the jQuery UI ones, I think the minus / plus buttons are a better paradigm :)
2017-11-20T14:44:37 <sepidehshahi> great! I am trying it on my cellphone. When you are side scrolling on the preferences, it does not snap to the next panel. I was wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s intentional. But overall it is really cool and it does not take up that much space alanharnum
2017-11-20T14:45:39 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I believe only the left/right buttons will cause it to snap to the next panel - otherwise it scrolls normally

2017-11-20T14:45:57 <sepidehshahi> ok

2017-11-20T15:14:26 <Justin_o> alanharnum, sepidehshahi: sorry just saw this.. yes, it only snaps to the next/previous panel if you click the arrows. It will also snap to the closest panel when you close and reopen UIO.
2017-11-20T15:14:32 <Justin_o> jhung: sure, want to chat now?
2017-11-20T15:16:43 <jhung> nevermind, I forwarded you the email which you checked already Justin_o
2017-11-20T15:17:39 <Justin_o> jhung: ah okay

2017-11-20T16:38:00 <alanharnum> also possibly of interest from my weekend: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/design-systems-book/ - I bought a hybrid ebook / hardcover copy, people are welcome to borrow the hardcover when it arrives
2017-11-20T16:42:04 <alanharnum> "What are the key qualities of a well-functioning, enduring design system? This question intrigued me so much I spent a huge amount of time researching and thinking about it. My research and thoughts provide the basis of this book."

2017-11-20T17:20:25 <alanharnum> seidehshahi: sure thing - I haven\'t dug into it too deeply so far but the book seems really interesting

2017-11-20T20:03:31 <gmoss> not to voluntell anyone, but perhaps danayo would be willing to share her latest drafts of the storytelling tool that she mentioned at standup today? I don\'t have anything to present, myself
2017-11-20T20:03:37 <gmoss> jhung ^
2017-11-20T20:05:15 <jhung> gmoss: ok. I\'ll leave room for that if danayo wants to share anything.

2017-11-20T20:49:09 <jhung> sepidehshahi: thanks! I\'ll take a look.
2017-11-20T20:49:16 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2017-11-20T21:02:43 <jhung> sepidehshahi: is it okay if I make edits directly to the ILDH Learning Differences doc?

2017-11-20T21:04:40 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I forgot to mention to you that last week I added my notes to the design crit comments. Actually you had covered almost everything, so I added just a few things :)
2017-11-20T21:04:56 <danayo> ok thanks sepidehshahi
2017-11-20T21:05:03 <sepidehshahi> np
