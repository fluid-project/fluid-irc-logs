2017-08-25T13:31:41 <Jess_> jhung: alanharnum: do you two know if we have any IDI stickers floating around the office? hidden somewhere?
2017-08-25T13:32:39 <jhung> Jess_: I think whatever was left was put on top of the cubbies.
2017-08-25T13:33:30 <alanharnum> Jess_: I just had a look at the sticker collection on top of the cubbies and didn't see any
2017-08-25T13:33:37 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-08-25T13:33:46 <Jess_> :(
2017-08-25T13:34:28 <jhung> I printed those through StickerYou last time Jess_. Should we print some more?
2017-08-25T13:34:37 <Jess_> jhung: we should!
2017-08-25T13:34:54 <Jess_> i was actually sitting here thinking\xe2\x80\xa6 we should print a small number of all of our things
2017-08-25T13:35:05 <Jess_> e.g. big idea, our doors are open, floe
2017-08-25T13:37:40 <jhung> Sounds like a good idea! Infusion as well? We missing any? SNOW? Does SNOW have a logo?
2017-08-25T13:42:45 <Jess_> jhung: well, the postcards, right?
2017-08-25T13:42:49 <Jess_> infusion as well, yes
2017-08-25T13:43:01 <Jess_> like i said, i think we shoudl have a small number around always
2017-08-25T13:45:24 <jhung> I'll coordinate w danayo and lliskovoi to get those into the sticker template. Do you have a timeline in mind Jess_? (i.e. are there stickers you really need ASAP or can this wait a bit?)
2017-08-25T13:46:08 <Jess_> it can wait because i really need IDI stickers today so the ship has sailed. maybe JT has some
2017-08-25T13:46:44 <Jess_> but jhung i want to make sure i\xe2\x80\x99m not being confusing \xe2\x80\x94 where we have a sticker, let\xe2\x80\x99s print it \xe2\x80\x94 where we have a postcard let\xe2\x80\x99s print it
2017-08-25T13:46:46 <Jess_> make sense?
2017-08-25T13:47:09 <Jess_> so, i don\xe2\x80\x99t think we need to make things into stickers do we jhung ?
2017-08-25T13:47:56 <jhung> Jess_: They need to be a particular size (at least for the printer I used last time). So the logos usually have to be tweaked a bit to fit.
2017-08-25T13:48:22 <jhung> The Floe and IDI logos were done previously, so we can print those no problem. I can place an order for some Jess_?

2017-08-25T13:52:30 <Jess_> jhung: yes!
2017-08-25T13:52:41 <Jess_> not a huge number, but some!
2017-08-25T13:53:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-25T13:56:42 <jhung> ok Jess_.
2017-08-25T13:56:55 <Jess_> jhung: thanks muchly!
2017-08-25T14:00:06 <jhung> Jess_: I'll order the same quantity as last time (300 stickers total). It lasted us a good while and the volume pricing works out better.
2017-08-25T14:00:18 <Jess_> nice
2017-08-25T14:03:01 <Jess_> everyone: we\xe2\x80\x99re doing some testing in the collab room with vidyo \xe2\x80\x94 mind joining the strategy room if you can?

2017-08-25T19:59:38 <clown> I guess I should comment in github...
2017-08-25T20:00:26 <jhung> clown: good question. I'll check with the major 3.
