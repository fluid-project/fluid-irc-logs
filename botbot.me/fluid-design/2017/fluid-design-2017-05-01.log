2017-05-01T13:01:00 <Justin_o> i guess there was a hiccup or something

2017-05-01T16:26:40 <Caren> jhung: I will make the shapes, vegetables, animals \xe2\x80\x9ctags\xe2\x80\x9d. I will make them as tent cards. Visual on both sides.
2017-05-01T16:30:01 <jhung> Caren: sounds good!
2017-05-01T16:30:18 <jhung> Caren: can we make them tactile too? Not sure how.
2017-05-01T16:30:25 <jhung> Maybe puffy stickers?
2017-05-01T16:31:40 <Caren> yes, was thinking about tactile stickers
2017-05-01T16:35:37 * avtar joined the channel
2017-05-01T16:36:53 <jhung> awesome. I was thinking if we can't find good stickers, we can use actual toys instead for the match making. Thinking cars, a Lego brick, and dinosaurs?
2017-05-01T16:36:56 <jhung> ^Caren
2017-05-01T16:37:06 <jhung> Kind of fits the motif too.
2017-05-01T16:38:13 <Caren> yes, I was just exploring shapes of small toys my kids have
2017-05-01T16:48:34 <Caren> want the tactile experience to be different from the pieces used in marble run, and the groups of \xe2\x80\x9ctags\xe2\x80\x9d to be a different experience from each other. Am thinking shape, texture, size contrasts within the framework of the create-a-thon. Extending visual communication design principles to inclusive design practice, I suppose :-)

2017-05-01T17:15:58 <Justin_o> i actually have a solution that is working everywhere but IE 11
2017-05-01T17:16:21 <michelled> oh Justin_o! that's excellent
2017-05-01T17:17:18 <jhung> Justin_o: sounds good!
2017-05-01T17:17:27 <jhung> I'll send out the email.
2017-05-01T17:17:54 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks, i still have to write some tests and wasn't sure what to do about IE 11... maybe we can chat about that at the design crit tomorrow
2017-05-01T17:17:56 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2017-05-01T17:18:08 <michelled> sounds good
2017-05-01T17:18:09 <jhung> ok
2017-05-01T17:18:14 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-05-01T17:18:16 <michelled> I'm really glad that you found a solution
2017-05-01T17:21:48 <Justin_o> michelled: yes, it's a combination of a couple of things alan had suggested to me
