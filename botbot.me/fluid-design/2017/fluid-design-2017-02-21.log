b"2017-02-21T20:03:14 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: do you have an example of some complex icons i can try with the SVG icon testing
2017-02-21T20:03:47 <jhung> First discovery I think has some Justin_o.
2017-02-21T20:04:42 <Justin_o> jhung: do we have the SVGs for those
2017-02-21T20:04:42 <Justin_o> ?

2017-02-21T15:11:36 <jhung> Jess_: So far so good. Just using the web client for now.
2017-02-21T15:12:22 <Jess_> jhung: i found on mail.app and on IOS i had to make a change to the acct for it to work \xe2\x80\x94 e.g. change the name. i would describe it as not-entirely-obvious or smooth
2017-02-21T15:13:41 <Justin_o> Jess_: i got it to work fine on iOS but have been having issues on my computer today. I e-mailed them and it seems I needed to add a user name
2017-02-21T15:14:12 <Jess_> Justin_o: ios was much easier for me too \xe2\x80\x94 not sure why
2017-02-21T15:14:54 <Justin_o> strange eh
2017-02-21T15:17:37 <Justin_o> Jess_, jhung: do you know what weight the stock for the design cards was?
2017-02-21T15:18:44 <Jess_> Justin_o: when lisa printed with TPH it was 100lb
2017-02-21T15:18:50 <danayo> sorting it out now Jess_!
2017-02-21T15:18:53 <danayo> email that is
2017-02-21T15:19:21 <Justin_o> Jess_: thanks, so i checked the printer we have at the office, it\'s supposed to do up to 80lbs
2017-02-21T15:19:37 <Justin_o> potentially that\'s why we have trouble printing them here
2017-02-21T15:19:43 <Jess_> danayo: good luck!
2017-02-21T15:20:02 <Jess_> Justin_o: the 100lb is really nice to have, but i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s must-have
2017-02-21T15:21:10 <jhung> Justin_o, Jess_ : Staples has 5x8 blank index cards. Not sure their weight though. We could print on those. http://www.staples.ca/en/Staples-White-Blank-Index-Cards-5-x-8-/product_570633_2-CA_1_20001
2017-02-21T15:21:25 * Caren joined the channel
2017-02-21T15:21:57 <Justin_o> jhung: the comment there "These are not index cards, they are only slightly thicker than computer paper..."
2017-02-21T15:22:06 <Jess_> jhung: you mean so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to trim from a full sheet?
2017-02-21T15:22:53 <jhung> Jess_: that\'d be the idea assuming we can find stock the right size and weight. :)
2017-02-21T15:23:01 <Justin_o> jhung and Jess_: Pat also suggested looking at Vista Print to see their cost and delivery time
2017-02-21T15:23:24 <Justin_o> and that we could also check with the copy & print department here to see if they have the paper we want
2017-02-21T15:23:42 <Jess_> Justin_o: sepideh printed with teh OCAD folks at a lighter weight
2017-02-21T15:23:48 <Jess_> don\xe2\x80\x99t know the cost\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-02-21T15:24:13 <Justin_o> Jess_: she was even just suggesting getting the paper through them and still printing ourselves as an option if the cost is too high
2017-02-21T15:24:24 <Justin_o> but maybe they don\'t carry the weight we want either way
2017-02-21T15:24:43 <Jess_> Justin_o: if we bend on the weight, i think we have more options (obv)
2017-02-21T15:25:00 <jhung> Justin_o, Jess_: G&T has oxford 5x8 cards on "medium weight". https://www.grandandtoy.com/en/product/50-0_Oxford_Blank_Index_Cards%2c_100Pack.aspx
2017-02-21T15:25:20 <Jess_> jhung: too many options!
2017-02-21T15:26:23 <Jess_> jhung: so, decision points: full page or cards; weight considerations, and cost
2017-02-21T15:26:56 <Jess_> i wonder jhung if you and Pat can do a kind of gathering of options? 80lb for us to print and 100lb asking folks like vista print and kinkos about cost?
2017-02-21T15:27:25 <jhung> yes Jess_. If we go with card dimensions, we would have to spend time (maybe a morning?) to reformat the existing Illustrator file to fit the new dimensions.
2017-02-21T15:27:46 <Jess_> jhung: but in the long run it might save us time for future printing?
2017-02-21T15:27:53 <jhung> Otherwise if we stick with 8x11, we can print as-is (assuming there aren\'t any content changes). But we\'ll have to pay for cutting.
2017-02-21T15:28:07 <Jess_> or cut ourselves which is laborious
2017-02-21T15:28:31 <jhung> Jess_: yes.
2017-02-21T15:29:02 <danayo> jhung, Jess_ : wonder how the existing format would look printed on 5X8 - need to take a look - might be ok?
2017-02-21T15:29:15 <Jess_> oh, good idea danayo. yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s see
2017-02-21T15:29:18 <danayo> lemme take a look
2017-02-21T15:30:27 <danayo> looks like i got my email sorted Jess_ :)
2017-02-21T15:30:36 <Jess_> danayo: that was fast!
2017-02-21T15:31:04 <Jess_> jhung: if you reconfig to fit the cards will that be reusable once changes are made to the content e.g.?
2017-02-21T15:33:49 <jhung> Jess_: yes assuming we keep printing on the same stock. Eventually we\'d want to replicate a similar format onto the actual guide site, but the trick is finding the time to do that (maybe after BIG IDeA?)
2017-02-21T15:34:09 <Jess_> yeah
2017-02-21T15:36:12 <Jess_> jhung: should i reach out to Pat to ask her to get some quotes from OCAD and Vista and Staples?
2017-02-21T15:37:20 * amatas joined the channel
2017-02-21T15:38:34 <jhung> Jess_: Sure. Can\'t hurt as an option. I would like to find decent 5x8 stock though since that would enable us to self-print.
2017-02-21T15:38:53 <Jess_> jhung: great idea
2017-02-21T15:39:14 <Jess_> and danayo is gonna try printing them as-is on a card to see what the output looks like, right?
2017-02-21T15:40:15 <Caren> Hi all\xe2\x80\xa6consider that 5x8 stock may be more costly than conventional sizes like 8x11.5
2017-02-21T15:41:13 <Caren> How many would you need to slice/cut? perhaps investing in a guillotine is worth while?
2017-02-21T15:42:38 <Caren> http://www.staples.ca/paper+cutter/directory_paper%2520cutter_20051_1_20001?
2017-02-21T15:42:54 <Caren> OCAD may even have one that can migrate over here?
2017-02-21T15:43:09 <jhung> Caren: we have one and it was very time consuming to cut.
2017-02-21T15:43:34 <Caren> ah, ok. You have lots to cut, then.
2017-02-21T15:43:35 <jhung> Each 8.5x11 sheet needed 7 cuts.
2017-02-21T15:44:25 <Justin_o> Caren: yah, when there\'s multiple sets it took a while.. maybe an afternoon to cut out
2017-02-21T15:45:59 <Caren> :-) that\xe2\x80\x99s time consuming
2017-02-21T15:46:21 * michelled joined the channel
2017-02-21T16:02:38 <danayo> jhung, Jess_, Caren, if we could print right to the edge of the 5X8 cards, it would look like this https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/etynN6XiL5X14ud
2017-02-21T16:02:52 <danayo> but I imagine we\'ll need some bleed?
2017-02-21T16:03:11 <danayo> this is with the cards as-is
2017-02-21T16:03:13 <danayo> as-are?
2017-02-21T16:05:11 <jhung> danayo: I don\'t think we\'ll be able to print right to the edge using our office printers, but if we send it out to a service we can get it to the edge.
2017-02-21T16:10:53 <danayo> ok jhung
2017-02-21T16:11:04 <danayo> any idea what the office printer bleed is?
2017-02-21T16:11:12 <danayo> bleed/border
2017-02-21T16:12:51 <jhung> danayo: Sorry i don\'t know. Would it be alright if we just specified "Scale to fit" on the print option? This might mean reducing the padding from the edge-to-text?
2017-02-21T16:13:09 <jhung> ^ to ensure that the text doesn\'t get scaled down too much
2017-02-21T16:13:46 <Jess_> danayo: that looks good! i guess, can we get a weight of card we like jhung?
2017-02-21T16:15:08 <jhung> Jess_: based on Justin_o\'s comment earlier I\'m guessing we want a max of 80lb. stock. The problem is I don\'t know which product is best.
2017-02-21T16:15:28 <jhung> The product descriptions on Staples and G&T are not helpful.
2017-02-21T16:16:07 <Jess_> jhung: yeah, and those aren\xe2\x80\x99t card stock
2017-02-21T16:16:58 <jhung> Jess_: thicker than standard paper stock though\xe2\x80\xa6 which might be enough?
2017-02-21T16:17:12 <Jess_> jhung: in a pinch, i\xe2\x80\x99d think so
2017-02-21T16:17:45 <Jess_> jhung: why don\xe2\x80\x99t we try and see if we like the result
2017-02-21T16:18:05 <danayo> jhung: we could scale to fit, which on our printers I think would look something like this https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/P02a7VuhojEk8uN
2017-02-21T16:18:21 <danayo> this would require removing all crop marks
2017-02-21T16:18:29 <danayo> and reducing the padding would be some work I guess
2017-02-21T16:18:34 <danayo> was trying to avoid changing the files
2017-02-21T16:19:38 <Jess_> jhung: for the future: https://www.paper-garden.ca
2017-02-21T16:21:04 <jhung> danayo: yeah. Saving work would be ideal. :) The scale to fit looks okay.
2017-02-21T16:27:38 <jhung> Jess_: for paper stock, I was thinking that maybe Michaels might have better / heavier stock. I can take a look tonight.
2017-02-21T16:33:15 <Jess_> scale-to-fit FTW!
