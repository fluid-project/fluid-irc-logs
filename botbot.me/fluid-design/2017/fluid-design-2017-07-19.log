2017-07-19T13:47:29 <Caren> morning, jhung
2017-07-19T13:48:02 <Caren> do you have time to talk PhET?
2017-07-19T13:56:26 <jhung> Maybe later this afternoon Caren?

2017-07-19T14:03:50 <simonjb> hi jhung, I\'m starting on adding a News entry to the Floe site on the Science Lab and I was wondering on the front page, do we keep the number of News entries to 3? If I add one, should I bump the bottom one off?
2017-07-19T14:04:04 <Caren> jhung: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to swing this afternoon.

2017-07-19T14:28:32 <simonjb> thanks jhung
2017-07-19T14:28:36 <jhung> Caren: ok. How\'s 11am?

2017-07-19T14:43:58 <Caren> ok, jhung. see you at 11 on vidyo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll open my room
2017-07-19T14:44:08 <jhung> ok Caren
2017-07-19T14:45:44 <simonjb> jhung: for the Floe News entry, if I\'m referencing a video, should I link to YouTube or use their embedded player, do you think?
2017-07-19T14:46:01 <simonjb> do we want video right on the Floe site?
2017-07-19T14:47:06 * alanharn_ has quit
2017-07-19T14:48:51 <michelled> simonjb: we already have video on the floe site: http://floeproject.org/security.html so I don\'t see any reason to not embed the video.
2017-07-19T14:50:25 <simonjb> thanks michelled, though we don\'t currently have any on the News page http://floeproject.org/news/
2017-07-19T14:51:12 <jhung> simonjb: I think it\'s okay to embed the video.
2017-07-19T14:51:16 <michelled> that\'s true. I doubt there\'s any reason for that except that we haven\'t thought of it.
2017-07-19T14:51:47 <simonjb> thanks both, I\'ll go ahead and use the player

2017-07-19T15:10:43 <grrrero> danayo: Hey Dana, wanted to ask for your opinion re: arrows in the UIO prefs
2017-07-19T15:11:17 <grrrero> Justin_o directed me to our own icon font set and he says that you had a preference for a "skinnier" arrow
2017-07-19T15:11:44 <grrrero> Was looking at the mockups here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+%28Learner%29+Options+Mobile+and+Responsive+Design
2017-07-19T15:12:06 <grrrero> I might try to duplicate it, if it\'s still the same design you want to use?
2017-07-19T15:13:43 <Justin_o> grrrero: i believe dana might have so new designs using numbers instead of bread crumbs, like 5/10
2017-07-19T15:13:51 <Justin_o> grrrero: and possibly with the arrows moved to the bottom as well
2017-07-19T15:13:53 <danayo> hi grrrero
2017-07-19T15:15:17 * colinclark has quit
2017-07-19T15:15:52 <danayo> just double-checking, I may have done a slight iteration on that skinny arrow
2017-07-19T15:16:11 <grrrero> Alright cool, thanks danayo!
2017-07-19T15:18:36 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-07-19T15:22:50 <danayo> grrrero: very similar, just slightly heavier/darker -  https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/GYST03DC1S2y2nm
2017-07-19T15:23:02 <danayo> I\'ll post these to the wiki as well
2017-07-19T15:23:36 <grrrero> Thank you, danayo! The images on the wiki are actually broken links
2017-07-19T15:23:54 <danayo> I know grrrero, sorry about that, the page got corrupted somehow, have to fix!
2017-07-19T15:24:02 <grrrero> So breadcrumbs are not numbers? danayo
2017-07-19T15:25:16 <danayo> grrrero: since there is a possibility of having many preference panels, we talked about replacing the breadcrumb dots with numbers (like Justin_o described - 1/10, 2/10 etc)
2017-07-19T15:27:51 <grrrero> danayo: In that format?
2017-07-19T15:28:00 <grrrero> How big/small should it be

2017-07-19T15:58:24 <danayo> I thought of using a "1 of 10" format, but for simplicity and avoiding language translation etc, I think this works better

2017-07-19T18:06:53 <simonjb> hi michelled and jhung, I\'ve committed a first pass at adding a news entry for the Science Lab to the floe site

2017-07-19T18:07:54 <simonjb> what\'s the process for reviewing this? in terms of technical and content
2017-07-19T18:08:11 <simonjb> I\'m thinking jhung for technical

2017-07-19T18:08:47 <michelled> simonjb: I think jhung generally handles it
2017-07-19T18:09:18 <simonjb> and in terms of content and tone -- jhung also?
2017-07-19T18:11:21 <michelled> I think so
2017-07-19T18:11:31 <michelled> I don\'t think we have any formal process around this

2017-07-19T18:35:42 <simonjb> jhung: will do, thanks jhung
