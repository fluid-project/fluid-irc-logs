2017-03-16T15:59:32 <Jess_> fluid-everyone: don\xe2\x80\x99t forget about Mary Louise Hayward tonight on Vidyo if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to attend...
2017-03-16T16:01:28 <Jess_> michelled: that email is actually a thread from the everyone list \xe2\x80\x94 can i give you the subject and you see if you can find it rather than forwarding all of the thread?  it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNot in our guide\xe2\x80\xa6"
2017-03-16T16:03:35 <danayo> Jess_, michelled: when I go to add the Privacy stuff to the guide I can also add the grandparent/toddler activity that Jutta described
2017-03-16T16:03:51 <michelled> ah, thanks Jess_
2017-03-16T16:04:05 <michelled> thanks danayo

2017-03-16T16:37:16 <jhung> fluid-everyone: can someone please record the meeting with Mary Louise Hayward? I won\'t be able to attend.
2017-03-16T16:37:56 <Jess_> jhung: i\xe2\x80\x99ll ask JT if she\xe2\x80\x99ll record. it\xe2\x80\x99s her class so I worry that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to
2017-03-16T16:38:14 <Jess_> fluid-everyone: here\xe2\x80\x99s a nice article by Cyndi Rowland re: Berkeley http://webaim.org/blog/uc-berkeley-inaccessibility/
2017-03-16T16:38:43 <jhung> Jess_: thanks
2017-03-16T16:41:21 <jhung> just read that article Jess_. I think it expresses much of the frustration being felt.
2017-03-16T16:48:18 <Jess_> jhung: and she holds Berkeley to the standard we\xe2\x80\x99re all held to. i can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t fix this
2017-03-16T16:49:37 * clown has quit
2017-03-16T16:49:47 <jhung> Jess_: I agree. It\'s very disappointing. I hope other institutions step up and become an exemplar at how it can be done.
2017-03-16T16:50:16 <jhung> Jess_: I was thinking about Edify and why I like their group so much, and I think it\'s related to this topic.
2017-03-16T16:51:07 <jhung> Edify took the issue of accessibility as a challenge to become better.
2017-03-16T16:51:19 <jhung> Other groups see it the opposite \xe2\x80\xa6
2017-03-16T16:52:18 <Jess_> jhung: that\xe2\x80\x99s awesome! Berkeley is huge but stil...
2017-03-16T16:52:45 <Jess_> i quite liked Barbara Illowsky, from OEGlobal\xe2\x80\x99s tweet: Barbara Illowsky\xe2\x80\x8f @DrBSI  Mar 6
2017-03-16T16:52:45 <Jess_> I hope that Cal will make all future content #accessible from the very start. If I can do it, so can Cal profs.
2017-03-16T16:54:07 <jhung> Jess_: do you know if all departments are bound by this decision, or can they do their own thing? i.e. depts can still release their content open, free, and captioned if they want.
2017-03-16T16:54:42 <Jess_> jhung: i don\xe2\x80\x99t know. i haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in on Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s central IT or acacemic IT since Fluid Academic and Mara Hancock years
2017-03-16T16:56:11 <jhung> Jess_: I can\'t imagine everyone at UCB being happy with this decision. It\'s a great opportunity for some activism at various levels.
2017-03-16T16:56:32 <Jess_> jhung: i bet! i think this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the last we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear about it
2017-03-16T16:58:30 <jhung> Jess_: I hope it isn\'t either! There can be a lot of positive things that can come of this, even if the current decision isn\'t great.
2017-03-16T16:59:03 <Jess_> jhung: it\xe2\x80\x99s still shocking to me \xe2\x80\x94 as Rowland says in teh article \xe2\x80\x94 Berkeley is the premier, the most progressive...
