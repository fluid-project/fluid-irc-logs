2017-08-30T13:10:17 <Caren> Hi Justin_o
2017-08-30T13:11:36 * clown joined the channel
2017-08-30T13:12:52 <Justin_o> Caren: hello
2017-08-30T13:13:31 <Caren> Hi! Justin_o would you happen to know how I might create in-document links within one page on the wiki? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to link the contents section to the relevant content on the page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=142999888&draftShareId=95cad86d-ddaf-4837-8d0e-9fd298f556f8
2017-08-30T13:15:00 <Justin_o> Caren: if you use the table of contents widget ( macro ). It will create it for you automatically. I you want to use your own, you should be able to use the id of the heading after a "#" as the link. (e.g. #header-id).
2017-08-30T13:26:42 <Caren> thanks Justin_o. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little lost. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see where the widgets are and I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand where/how to get the #id to work. Maybe I will see if you\xe2\x80\x99re availble in person when I\xe2\x80\x99m at the IDRC.
2017-08-30T13:27:43 <Caren> probably easier in person :-)
2017-08-30T13:30:33 <Justin_o> Caren: yes, probably easier in person. Will you be in today or tomorrow?
2017-08-30T13:32:17 <Caren> Justin_o: I plan to be in on Friday because I have chld care (!)
2017-08-30T13:37:08 <Justin_o> Caren: ah, i won\'t be in the office on Friday. Would you like to try to chat about it over vidyo now?
2017-08-30T13:37:52 <Caren> sure Justin_o, that would be great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll open my room.
2017-08-30T13:39:28 <Justin_o> Caren: thanks, i\'m in your room now

2017-08-30T15:50:07 <jhung> it\'s more of a way of summarizing our work so we can move onto Faraday\'s Law michelled
2017-08-30T15:50:24 <jhung> It\'ll go onto the wiki page when it\'s done and replace the front landing page for ESP michelled
2017-08-30T15:50:30 <Caren> michelled: It\xe2\x80\x99s a summary of findings and next steps. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0yhgYasoVQiYVlEPrP6YhNohV88LdiJGFLEzHHim2Q/edit

2017-08-30T16:08:54 <gmoss> thanks for sharing
2017-08-30T16:09:03 <Jess_> gah, missed standup altogether \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m heads down and elbow deep in CFI reporting
2017-08-30T16:09:12 <Jess_> you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ping to get my attention :( sorry
2017-08-30T16:18:57 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss, do you have notes from SJRK meeting yesterday? I took copious notes on my airbook but it seems it might have finally bit the dust
2017-08-30T16:20:04 <danayo> or michelled ^ ?
2017-08-30T16:20:33 <gmoss> danayo: yes! I also took copious notes and I\'ll forward those to you shortly :) that\'s a shame about your computer
2017-08-30T16:20:50 <danayo> that\'s great news gmoss
2017-08-30T16:21:17 <michelled> phew - I didn\'t take notes, so glad you did

2017-08-30T17:21:10 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss: what do you think about planning an SJRK storytelilng tool crit in 2 weeks from now, instead of next week (so that would be Sept 12)? I\'m just thinking that we\'ll have a little more to show and discuss by then, especially with the holiday this Monday
2017-08-30T17:22:05 <alanharnum> danayo: that works for me

2017-08-30T19:18:59 <danayo> thanks! you figured out the problem in Firefox?
2017-08-30T19:19:10 <jhung> I figured out what was wrong with Firefox\xe2\x80\xa6 it was a problem with normalize.css being too old. Infusion comes with a very old copy (v4). normalize is now v7
2017-08-30T19:19:17 <danayo> awesome
2017-08-30T19:19:31 <jhung> I\'ll send an email to list asking to upgrade.
2017-08-30T19:20:21 <danayo> great.
2017-08-30T19:21:05 <danayo> jhung: it looks like that last style change (the added margin for details) didn\'t get in
2017-08-30T19:22:06 <danayo> not a big deal I don\'t think
2017-08-30T19:22:54 <jhung> danayo: looks fine to me. *scratches head*
2017-08-30T19:23:12 <danayo> oh weird jhung
2017-08-30T19:23:26 <danayo> i\'ll try clearing my cache?
2017-08-30T19:23:39 <jhung> The margin was only for the description that appears when opened. Otherwise you won\'t see it.
