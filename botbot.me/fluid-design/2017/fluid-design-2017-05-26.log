2017-05-26T12:55:06 <Caren> morning Jon. Started a digital mind map yesterday on Coggle. Was manually creating maps but wanted something we could access remotely and have collab opportunities. Coggle seems to act like google in that you have to have an account to access a shared link. The base level is free and that is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using. Here is the link to the map started yesterday:

2017-05-26T13:33:18 <jhung> Justin_o, Caren - I might not make it to the PhET meeting today. Currently dealing with a really bad headache and I might leave early. But I also need to get a report done as well, so I might skip today if that's okay with you guys.
