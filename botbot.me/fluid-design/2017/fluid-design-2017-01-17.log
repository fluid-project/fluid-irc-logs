2017-01-17T17:00:10 <lliskovoi> Hey jhung, do you want to set a time to meet and talk text steps re: Big Idea resources?
2017-01-17T17:10:26 <jhung> lliskovoi: in 20 minutes? I\'m eating my lunch.
2017-01-17T17:14:08 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Quick question. If you were playing a chess game on your phone or computer and you saw the option "Check for Updates" in a menu. What do you think that menu item does?
2017-01-17T17:14:36 <clown> jhung, which menu?
2017-01-17T17:14:37 <cindyli> jhung: checks the newer version of this game
2017-01-17T17:14:57 <danayo> jhung: same as cindyli
2017-01-17T17:15:09 <jhung> clown: like in the Settings menu
2017-01-17T17:15:31 <jhung> danayo, cindyli: would you expect it to do anything else?
2017-01-17T17:15:46 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'d probably think that meant game updates. Although I wouldn\'t expect to see such an option on my phone as the updates are handled by a different system there
2017-01-17T17:15:48 <clown> jhung, if it were the "apple" menu on a Mac, I would think "that is asking for system updates"
2017-01-17T17:16:03 * michelled has quit
2017-01-17T17:16:06 <cindyli> no, jhung
2017-01-17T17:16:16 <clown> if it were in an application menu, I would think as cindyli suggested.
2017-01-17T17:17:02 <jhung> cindyli, clown, Justin_o, danayo: Thanks! Very helpful.
2017-01-17T17:22:17 <jhung> lliskovoi: I\'m free now. Call me when you\'re ready.
