2017-12-11T20:19:40 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Hello from snowy Winnipeg. I won't be around to facilitate the design crit. Is there anything for tomorrow?
2017-12-11T20:20:47 <danayo> thanks jhung, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything
2017-12-11T20:21:38 <simonjb> jhung: we had discussed the possibility of discussing the Visible Nexus though it might be better to wait until the new year when we have more time
2017-12-11T20:24:52 <jhung> simonjb ok. colinclark I got your email re: Bodies in Translation. I'll coordinate with Lindsey to figure out a time.
2017-12-11T20:25:08 <colinclark> thanks jhung, that's great

2017-12-11T20:57:58 <grrrero> Hey jhung
2017-12-11T20:58:04 <grrrero> Did you get some Jollibee yet :)
2017-12-11T20:58:11 * avtar joined the channel
2017-12-11T20:58:26 <jhung> lol not yet, but I passed it in the taxi on my way to the museum. :)
2017-12-11T20:58:40 <grrrero> Awww man
2017-12-11T20:58:44 <jhung> :)
2017-12-11T20:59:01 <grrrero> Get the chickenjoy and the jolly hotdog haha
2017-12-11T20:59:37 <jhung> haha I'll try my best. :)
2017-12-11T20:59:43 <grrrero> What's up!!
2017-12-11T20:59:52 <jhung> I have a SNOW question
2017-12-11T20:59:54 <grrrero> Sure
2017-12-11T21:00:07 <grrrero> Usually it's me asking you the questions so I'll do my best :)
2017-12-11T21:00:11 <jhung> lol
2017-12-11T21:00:52 <jhung> I was wondering if you got multi-level navigation working for the sidebar? I'm wondering because a question came up for BIG IDeA.
2017-12-11T21:00:55 <jhung> ^ grrrero
2017-12-11T21:01:22 <grrrero> jhung: Tbh I haven't gotten to that part yet... I can look into it tomorrow so I have a better idea though
2017-12-11T21:01:33 <grrrero> What's the question for BIG IDeA?
2017-12-11T21:04:04 <jhung> Someone who's helping create some content for the site was wondering how to get navigation for sub-posts. I knew it was in the design for Snow, so I was wondering if you had looked at it grrrero. I think what I will do is reply in saying that we're looking into it, but won't be right away.
2017-12-11T21:04:34 <grrrero> Ok
2017-12-11T21:04:43 <grrrero> Yeah I'll work on that tomorrow
2017-12-11T21:05:18 <grrrero> cindyli did some code review for me for the PHP code and was looking at it so that's why I haven't been touching the other stuff
2017-12-11T21:07:58 <jhung> no prob grrrero. Let me know how it goes.
2017-12-11T21:08:52 <grrrero> Will do jhung
2017-12-11T21:08:55 <grrrero> Keep warm out there :)
2017-12-11T21:09:20 <jhung> grrrero: haha. thanks!
