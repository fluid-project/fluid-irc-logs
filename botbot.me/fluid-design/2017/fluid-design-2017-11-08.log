2017-11-08T16:04:31 <grrrero> Ok alanharnum
2017-11-08T16:04:44 <michelled> I think colinclark is in a meeting at that time
2017-11-08T16:05:41 <alanharnum> colinclark are you able to sneak out for 11:15 - 11:30ish? That's about the only time we've got a free JT
2017-11-08T16:09:20 <colinclark> yep

2017-11-08T16:30:05 <alanharnum> my update: working yesterday and this morning on SJRK, especially year one report
2017-11-08T16:44:14 <Justin_o> danayo: thinking about the vidyo call for todays community meeting
2017-11-08T16:44:56 <Justin_o> I'm pretty sure that when Tom presented a few months ago that he joined as a guest.. although i don't remember if they shared slides or just held things up to the camera

2017-11-08T17:02:03 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-08T17:05:24 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, sorry I missed standup. thanks a lot for all the comments and edits on the Diverese learning styles document.
2017-11-08T17:06:52 <danayo> Justin_o: Andrew and I tested Vidyo out and we\xe2\x80\x99re good to go. Screen sharing as a guest works fine. One thing - he just told me he only has until 11, so if we can avoid starting late that would be great :)
2017-11-08T17:07:25 <danayo> sepidehshahi: no worries, I still need to finish looking it over - might not get to it today, but tomorrow for sure
2017-11-08T17:07:41 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks for getting that worked out. Will try to end on time.
2017-11-08T17:07:52 <Justin_o> or rather, will try to start on time
2017-11-08T17:08:12 <sepidehshahi> that would be great danayo thanks
2017-11-08T17:08:39 <danayo> cool thanks Justin_o

2017-11-08T19:32:10 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks
2017-11-08T19:32:39 <colinclark> be there in a sec, sorry
2017-11-08T19:32:46 <colinclark> michelled: are you going to join us as well?
2017-11-08T19:35:18 <michelled> yep!
2017-11-08T20:06:41 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: one thing I forgot to ask. for co-design and involving users in this do you think we need REB?
2017-11-08T20:06:53 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-11-08T20:06:55 <colinclark> I'm hoping not
2017-11-08T20:07:01 <colinclark> it's something we can explore when we get the grant
2017-11-08T20:07:15 <colinclark> but I think the nature of this work is design, rather than research with human subjects
2017-11-08T20:07:18 <Caren_> hi grrrero I heard back from my friend about the agency
2017-11-08T20:07:37 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right colinclark
2017-11-08T20:07:50 <Caren_> here\xe2\x80\x99s what she said: Jinkholm International Inc. was the name of my agency. But I think 2010 was already closed and banned.
2017-11-08T20:07:51 <grrrero> Oh nice Caren_ !
2017-11-08T20:07:59 <colinclark> but let's see how it goes based on our plan for what the kinds of co-design work we'll engage people in
2017-11-08T20:07:59 <grrrero> Oh
2017-11-08T20:08:11 <grrrero> Sounds good. Thanks Caren
2017-11-08T20:08:22 * cindyli has quit
2017-11-08T20:08:59 <Caren_> more reason for this project!! grrrero
2017-11-08T20:09:10 <grrrero> Right colinclark
2017-11-08T20:09:50 <Caren_> grrrero: Maybe it is a case study if you need one\xe2\x80\xa6

2017-11-08T20:49:44 <jessm> alanharnum: too many meetings today
2017-11-08T20:50:05 <jessm> alanharnum: i\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if we can either shorten or resched. the 4:30?
2017-11-08T20:51:12 <alanharnum> jessm: i'd be fine to reschedule to tomorrow if danayo is - I feel like the last week somehow got completely swallowed in things that weren't working towards this report
2017-11-08T20:51:39 <jessm> alanharnum: i have workshops tomorrow and friday all day
2017-11-08T20:52:46 <alanharnum> jessm: is monday too late? I don't personally have questions that need immediate addressing - I've sent the call out to the partners for their materials, am filling out sections with supporting narrative
2017-11-08T20:53:05 <alanharnum> i'm fine to do a brief check-in at 4:30
2017-11-08T20:53:17 <alanharnum> or not, since the above is basically my check-in :)
2017-11-08T20:56:40 <alanharnum> we'll check in with danayo when she's back
2017-11-08T21:02:13 <alanharnum> jessm: I lied about no questions, sent a question in an email

2017-11-08T21:28:36 * danayo joined the channel
2017-11-08T21:29:47 <alanharnum> danayo, jessm was asking if we could shorten or reschedule the meeting - she's in workshops tomorrow and Friday, so maybe Monday? I don't think I have an immediate need for a check-in; I've been working to fill out the working document with some comments, continuing to do that.
2017-11-08T21:30:03 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-11-08T21:32:22 <danayo> sure alanharnum, jessm. it would be helpful for me to have a chat with you alanharnum about how to proceed - because the form and letter laid out 3 objectives, but the working doc is much more detailed.
2017-11-08T21:32:31 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how best to collaborate on it with you
2017-11-08T21:32:57 <alanharnum> danayo: that's my one question at this moment as well - what objectives does Oak expect in that report document?
2017-11-08T21:34:31 <danayo> yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing, but in the addendum to the letter, 3 objectives are described, and in the form they sent they broke it down into 3 objectives as well, so I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking those are the 3 objectives we need to answer to
2017-11-08T21:35:31 <jessm> danayo: alanharnum: lemme know how i can help
2017-11-08T21:35:52 <jessm> danayo: alanharnum harmonizing your two docs into dana\xe2\x80\x99s form sounds like good start
2017-11-08T21:36:54 <alanharnum> danayo, let's chat quick about the objectives - I'm worried I'm missing a doc somewhere now? jessm welcome to join, but I think we can sort this out ourselves
2017-11-08T21:37:31 <alanharnum> i've got one document with six objectives and another with four, want to make sure there wasn't a third that slipped my net
2017-11-08T21:37:35 <danayo> alanharnum: it\xe2\x80\x99s the form/template they sent - I sent a link in an email
2017-11-08T21:38:20 <danayo> I think there are only 3 in there
2017-11-08T21:39:58 <alanharnum> danayo: OK, I see - did that document have the objective descriptons filled out already, or just blank for us to fill in?
2017-11-08T21:40:07 <danayo> it was blank
2017-11-08T21:42:21 <alanharnum> OK, I haven't missed anything then, whew. So those three goals as stated are your wording of the objectives into the report format?
2017-11-08T21:42:28 * jessm has quit
2017-11-08T21:42:47 <alanharnum> (sorry, I feel like I may be being super obtuse here, lateness of the day)
2017-11-08T21:44:15 <danayo> no worries, yes. but we can just copy over from the addendum instead - I had taken that wording from the text michelle sent in an email
2017-11-08T21:44:20 <danayo> but then saw the addendum in the letter
2017-11-08T21:44:38 <danayo> which does a much better job of describing them!
2017-11-08T21:45:26 <alanharnum> OK, great - what I'd suggest then (if it sounds all right) is that we copy the four objectives of the letter into the Oak format. I don't think it's a problem to add a fourth.
2017-11-08T21:45:36 <alanharnum> Then we fill those out based on the material compiled in the working document.
2017-11-08T21:45:45 <alanharnum> How does that sound?
2017-11-08T21:46:12 <danayo> sounds perfect. just realised that there is in fact a fourth!
2017-11-08T21:46:24 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99ll copy them over
2017-11-08T21:46:45 <alanharnum> & maybe we can chat tomorrow in more detail about how best to work on this?
2017-11-08T21:47:27 <alanharnum> ah, I see they also ask for a maximum of four pages - so they want conciseness :)
2017-11-08T21:50:06 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-11-08T21:53:48 <danayo> oh interesting.
2017-11-08T21:53:52 <danayo> ok sure, let\xe2\x80\x99s chat tomorrow
2017-11-08T21:53:58 <danayo> alanharnum
