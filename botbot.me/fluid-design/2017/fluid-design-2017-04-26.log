2017-04-26T15:06:58 <danayo> hi jhung, made changes and created new PR, hopefully it\'s good to go https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/16
2017-04-26T15:17:49 <Caren> I got to try out Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Surface Studio and specifically Surface Dial last night at an event last night https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accessories/surface-dial It was beautiful and immersive. I wonder what the accessibility possibilites. The dial seemed to be similar to switch access.
2017-04-26T15:18:25 <colinclark> Caren: Oh!
2017-04-26T15:18:30 <colinclark> I\'ve been curious about it
2017-04-26T15:18:39 <colinclark> what kinds of things did you try with the Surface Studio?
2017-04-26T15:19:23 <Caren> The event was for the graduating student of the program I teach in at York/Sheridan\xe2\x80\xa6I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware that the Surface Studio\xe2\x80\x99s would be there.
2017-04-26T15:20:30 <Caren> There was a program that integrated the branding for manipulation
2017-04-26T15:20:52 <Caren> it was fairly basic interaction
2017-04-26T15:21:30 <Caren> to manipulate graphic imagery through filters like twist an wave

2017-04-26T15:22:09 <alanharnum> Caren colinclark simonjb: the surface dial would be an interesting device to have a Nexus driver for
2017-04-26T15:23:17 <simonjb> alanharnum: do you know what APIs are available for it?
2017-04-26T15:23:45 <alanharnum> simonjb: no, my guess would be Windows only
2017-04-26T15:23:53 <alanharnum> simonjb: https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/01/new-input-paradigm-windows-surface-dial/
2017-04-26T15:23:55 <Caren> The Dial was sitting on the screen when we first approached, and it seemed that it can be switched in as physical device in place of touch screen activation.
2017-04-26T15:24:19 <Caren> It was also used on table top

2017-04-26T15:25:00 <Caren> Cal was with me and was completely taken with the device. I was demoing it to guests before we left. haha
2017-04-26T15:27:10 <simonjb> https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/d/surface-dial/925r551sktgn

2017-04-26T15:31:44 <Caren> The dial turn is an interesting concept, too. liskovoi and I were discussing and experiencing the iPhone Rotor. It can be akward without a physical knob or device to grab.
2017-04-26T15:33:42 <Caren> edit to above: Cal was demoing the device!
2017-04-26T15:36:27 <jhung> danayo: I posted a comment to your PR regarding the use of the word "out" in that one sentence.
2017-04-26T15:39:38 <danayo> thanks jhung, maybe we can get a 3rd opinion
2017-04-26T15:39:52 <jhung> danayo sounds good!
2017-04-26T15:43:15 <jhung> michelled: maybe you can take a look at that sentence? I can point you to that PR.

2017-04-26T16:05:41 <colinclark> danayo, jhung: I wonder if you have any thoughts on quantifying our impact in the OER community
2017-04-26T16:05:45 <colinclark> Gianna is asking for the review tomorrow
2017-04-26T16:06:04 <colinclark> Do we know of any measures of the size of the OER community? Number of teachers who use OERs? Anything like that?
2017-04-26T16:06:14 <colinclark> Also any ideas on how large the audience for the ILDH is?
2017-04-26T16:07:28 <danayo> jhung change made and issued new PR
2017-04-26T16:09:05 <jhung> danayo: merged.
2017-04-26T16:09:12 <jhung> The update should go live shortly.
2017-04-26T16:09:23 <danayo> thank you jhung :)
2017-04-26T16:10:08 <danayo> colinclark: I have no idea! I suppose we can find out somehow ...
2017-04-26T16:10:54 <danayo> there must be some stats out there about OERs in general
2017-04-26T16:11:09 <colinclark> yeah, i\'m just doing some searching
2017-04-26T16:19:10 <Caren> colinclark, danayo: not sure if this is helpful. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little old but may lead to stats http://monitor.icef.com/2015/01/global-review-maps-state-moocs-2014/
2017-04-26T16:19:54 <colinclark> I guess the issue here is that this is about MOOCs specifically, rather than open content
2017-04-26T16:21:06 <colinclark> so for example, the content on Coursera may be free to study, but not necessarily supporting the "four Rs
2017-04-26T16:21:31 <colinclark> Reuse, revise, remix, redistribute
2017-04-26T16:21:42 <colinclark> https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/1123
2017-04-26T16:22:07 <michelled> jhung: we should link to this prominently - I think you might have the best feeling for where: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/accessibility/prototypes
2017-04-26T16:22:18 <Caren> MOOCs usually have a revenue model attached to them\xe2\x80\xa6right.
2017-04-26T16:22:48 <danayo> not sure if this is helpful here colinclark, but found an interesting site about OER myths: http://mythbusting.oerpolicy.eu/
2017-04-26T16:23:32 <colinclark> Caren: It\'s as much about what you can do with an OER as the revenue model
2017-04-26T16:23:55 <colinclark> There are companies that make money redistributing or adapting and selling OERs, for sure
2017-04-26T16:24:29 <colinclark> the key distinction is the ability to freely modify, combine, and share resources
2017-04-26T16:26:09 <Caren> thanks, colinclark. good to know those nuances!
2017-04-26T16:30:37 <danayo> Caren: Surface Dial has haptic feedback? what did you think of that?
2017-04-26T16:32:30 <danayo> found this colinclark: https://www.onlinelearningsurvey.com/oer.html
2017-04-26T16:33:02 <colinclark> oh cool
2017-04-26T16:33:05 <colinclark> i\'ll take a look through it
2017-04-26T16:33:30 <colinclark> jhung: Can you ask Emily if they have stats for PhET? i.e. number of teachers or studnets who use the sims?
2017-04-26T16:34:59 <Caren> danayo: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t experience the haptic feedback. I will ask Cal, he may have experienced it.
2017-04-26T16:35:35 <danayo> colinclark jhung: can we grab usage stats from our ILDH site?
2017-04-26T16:35:50 <colinclark> danayo: I asked gtirloni about it and unfortunately we don\'t track usage
2017-04-26T16:35:58 <danayo> :(
2017-04-26T16:35:59 <colinclark> he suggested we use Google Analytics
2017-04-26T16:36:08 <colinclark> which is a good idea, and something we should probably do with all our sites
2017-04-26T16:36:12 <danayo> yeah
2017-04-26T16:37:30 <colinclark> \xe2\x80\x9cTo my students cost is the most important thing.  To me, content is the most important.\xe2\x80\x9d (Full-time Mathematics Faculty)
2017-04-26T16:37:37 <colinclark> Privilege works in fascinating ways ;)
2017-04-26T16:38:14 <danayo> ha
2017-04-26T16:38:26 <danayo> that\'s hilarious
2017-04-26T16:38:34 <colinclark> it is
2017-04-26T16:38:44 <colinclark> but it also points to something interesting, which i am struggling to articulate
2017-04-26T16:38:55 <colinclark> the way "quality" is constructed
2017-04-26T16:39:06 <colinclark> and then binarized in interesting ways
2017-04-26T16:39:12 <colinclark> but i\'m not making much sense :)
2017-04-26T16:39:46 <danayo> can you elaborate colinclark?
2017-04-26T16:40:12 <danayo> i guess, really, content would be important to the students too
2017-04-26T16:40:16 <danayo> but there are barriers
2017-04-26T16:40:19 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2017-04-26T16:40:19 <danayo> i.e. cost
2017-04-26T16:42:09 <colinclark> I was hoping this page would have a bit more: https://openstax.org/impact
2017-04-26T16:42:29 <colinclark> interestingly, when you look at their "complete list of institutions" it\'s quite huge
2017-04-26T16:44:03 <jhung> colinclark:  I can ask Emily. It would help if I can give context what this is for.
2017-04-26T16:44:40 <jhung> michelled: I\'ll see where it\'s appropriate to put that link. Probably on the Floe sims page on the wiki (which gets included in the Collaborations page).
2017-04-26T16:45:39 <jhung> danayo: I never explicitly configured analytics for the ILDH. Maybe gtirloni knows if there are any logs.
2017-04-26T16:45:53 <colinclark> jhung: It is for a European Commission review in which we are presenting our collaboration with PhET and the OER community, where someone has asked for impact metrics\xe2\x80\x94they would like to now how broad our reach is when we work with the OER community
2017-04-26T16:46:07 <colinclark> know
2017-04-26T16:46:09 <jhung> awesome. thanks colinclark
2017-04-26T16:46:36 <colinclark> jhung: There are only two week logs for the ILDH
2017-04-26T16:46:47 <colinclark> we should set up GA for the site when we get a chance
2017-04-26T16:52:25 <colinclark> I have one stat here from an article Emily wrote for SNOW: "The PhET project impacts classrooms around the world with over 100 million sim runs per year, with sims available in 86 languages."
