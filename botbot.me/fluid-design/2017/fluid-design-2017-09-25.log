b'2017-09-25T20:26:21 <danayo> and of course there\'s this guide entry (which as you noted, is a bit general) https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/practices/PracticeCoDesign.html
2017-09-25T20:26:24 <danayo> and this one https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/practices/FacilitateInclusively.html
2017-09-25T20:26:33 <colinclark> general isn\'t bad
2017-09-25T20:26:34 <colinclark> :)
2017-09-25T20:26:45 <danayo> :)
2017-09-25T20:26:58 <colinclark> one of the distinctions we highlighted in regards to Participatory Design, which is worth thinking about for tomorrow, is this issue of ongoing "stewardship"
2017-09-25T20:27:08 <colinclark> "Participatory design methods do not explicitly provide a means for ongoing community \xe2\x80\x9cstewardship\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccuration\xe2\x80\x9d of the software product after the initial participatory methods have been completed"
2017-09-25T20:27:41 <colinclark> also that workshop-based approaches can\'t always accommodate all people that we want to reach and work with
2017-09-25T20:28:07 <colinclark> which is also what I think is interesting about our "small-scale" work with the Nexus videos and the minecraft session
2017-09-25T20:28:22 <colinclark> tailoring the approach and methods to who we want to work with
2017-09-25T20:28:25 <Jess_> there\xe2\x80\x99s something that i\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering \xe2\x80\x94 as a way to stay away from tokenization \xe2\x80\x94 when do we call it co-design and when do we call it participatory design?
2017-09-25T20:28:52 <colinclark> There are those three points in the paper that danayo and I wrote, Jess_
2017-09-25T20:29:03 <colinclark> I don\'t think it\'s important to make a hard and fast distinction
2017-09-25T20:29:12 <colinclark> certainly co-design is a form or participatory approach
2017-09-25T20:29:45 <colinclark> but you can look at the techniques that are commonly practiced as "participatory" and ask if they support ongoing community engagement and sustainability, for example
2017-09-25T20:30:12 <danayo> colinclark I\'m now thinking that this entry needs to say more about the stewardship point: https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/insights/UserContinuedDesign.html
2017-09-25T20:30:25 <colinclark> yup, I think you\'re right danayo
2017-09-25T20:30:29 <Jess_> yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. i also like that these design methods take away the need for the designer to have brilliant design ideas alone \xe2\x80\x94 there was a medium article about this i read today
2017-09-25T20:30:57 <Jess_> designers become facilitators of good ideas and good question askers and good framers
2017-09-25T20:31:13 <colinclark> that\'s true
2017-09-25T20:31:35 <colinclark> but it\'s also worth thinking through the "co" part, and experimenting with ways to be more than a facilitator
2017-09-25T20:32:00 <Jess_> for sure
2017-09-25T20:32:17 <colinclark> so that we can imagine designers and "users" alike can be sources of both good questions and good ideas
2017-09-25T20:32:22 <Jess_> it\xe2\x80\x99s an article about shoulder pads :) https://thedesignteam.io/shoulder-pads-ee3227f7345b
2017-09-25T20:32:31 <colinclark> and that the influence of those questions and ideas can be distributed more evenly
2017-09-25T20:32:33 <Jess_> of course
2017-09-25T20:33:01 <Jess_> yes, this is where i worry about the tokenization\xe2\x80\xa6.in practicality, some get paid
2017-09-25T20:33:05 <Jess_> some have jobs
2017-09-25T20:33:12 <Jess_> others are invited
2017-09-25T20:33:15 <Jess_> or welcomed
2017-09-25T20:33:28 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-25T20:33:38 <Jess_> there is much to say about the nature of the co\xe2\x80\x9d for sure
2017-09-25T20:34:24 <danayo> this all makes me think again of Jeanne Van Heeswijk\'s work --> she gets something going (I suppose it\'s a form of facilitation in the beginning) and then she backs off completely as it takes on a life of it\'s own in the community
2017-09-25T20:34:39 <danayo> and +1 to questioning the nature of the "co"
2017-09-25T20:34:43 <Jess_> danayo: that\xe2\x80\x99s what was so cool about what Ather did
2017-09-25T20:35:01 <Jess_> he totally stepped back \xe2\x80\x94 it seems to me that is necessary at some point for co-design
2017-09-25T20:35:16 <Jess_> i loved it \xe2\x80\x94 the folks in the groups were super empowered and were coming up with awesome ideas
2017-09-25T20:35:20 <Jess_> and just running with it
2017-09-25T20:35:27 <sepidehshahi> one of the other aspects of co-design is how to enable participants communicate their ideas. It\xe2\x80\x99s something different than facillitation. It\xe2\x80\x99s giving them tools, things, toys anything that helps them contribute
2017-09-25T20:35:28 <Jess_> Ather gave it a framing and then gave them space
2017-09-25T20:35:56 <Jess_> yes! they had pipe cleaners, legos, toys \xe2\x80\x94 some used them and some didn\xe2\x80\x99t! it was perfect
2017-09-25T20:36:00 <Jess_> they chose what worked best for them
2017-09-25T20:36:23 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: yes, that\'s a crucial point
2017-09-25T20:37:02 <colinclark> and then it\'s the ability to keep having a voice, beyond the event or activity or workshop
2017-09-25T20:37:07 <colinclark> to be able to get more involved over time
2017-09-25T20:37:19 <colinclark> and to continue to feel ownership over the results throughout the process
2017-09-25T20:37:31 <sepidehshahi> exactly, when you learn how you can talk about your ideas, you can continue to do so in your community
2017-09-25T20:37:32 <danayo> that sounds good Jess_, I wish Ather could have said more about that process!
2017-09-25T20:37:38 <Jess_> or, colinclark that\xe2\x80\x99s the building capacity piece \xe2\x80\x94 creating a community of one\xe2\x80\x99s own
2017-09-25T20:38:10 <Jess_> danayo: i know! I was hoping Ather would have shared more about that\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure he\xe2\x80\x99s super conscious about what he did \xe2\x80\x94 it was brilliant :)
2017-09-25T20:39:23 <Jess_> this is the point I was trying to help Dave to see\xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s got brilliant designers in his sports community \xe2\x80\x94 he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to look to the IDRC for brilliant design ideas
2017-09-25T20:39:27 <Jess_> he still has that bias
2017-09-25T20:41:21 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: I got to leave now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the slides tomorrow morning
2017-09-25T20:41:31 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: send them to us all? :)
2017-09-25T20:41:44 <sepidehshahi> for sure :)
2017-09-25T20:41:49 <colinclark> awesome
2017-09-25T20:41:50 <Jess_> they are first year master\xe2\x80\x99s students everyone
2017-09-25T20:42:34 <Jess_> and they read this everyone: http://www.dubberly.com/articles/an-evolving-map-of-design-practice-and-design-research.html
2017-09-25T20:42:43 <lliskovoi> thanks Jess_ that\'s good to know
2017-09-25T20:42:55 <lliskovoi> and what time is this happening tomorrow?
2017-09-25T20:45:01 * mrtyler has quit
2017-09-25T20:47:53 <Jess_> starting around 2 they are coming by
2017-09-25T20:47:58 <Jess_> lliskovoi: ^
2017-09-25T20:48:16 <lliskovoi> and it\'s about an hour?
2017-09-25T20:48:36 * simonjb has quit
2017-09-25T20:49:52 <Jess_> the other point from Ather\xe2\x80\x99s workshop i liked was just how folks were thinking of how other people with other disabilities or needs would interact with their prototype \xe2\x80\x94 again, suggesting co-design is building on empathy as a tool, not absolving it by putting the responsibility on the individual. it\xe2\x80\x99s much more collective empathy
2017-09-25T20:54:54 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-25T20:56:43 <danayo> yes Jess_ : empathy is such an complicated point it seems to me - like you say, we can\'t absolve ourselves of trying to understand someone else\'s experience (which puts all the responsibility on them to educate us) - while somehow balancing this with "nothing about us without us" or the assumption that I can know what it\'s like for someone else with a very different experience than mine
2017-09-25T21:01:40 <danayo> I guess what I am trying to say Jess_ is empathy is really important, and I also find it a tricky balance - particularly re: the point you make about putting the responsibility on the individual (if I understood you correctly)
2017-09-25T21:02:43 <Jess_> yeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s sticky stuff for sure \xe2\x80\x94 i think pulling out some of those sticky issues: power, equity, responsibility are all really rich ones for a convo
2017-09-25T21:02:59 <Jess_> we can throw the NFL in there for good measure too ;)
2017-09-25T21:03:09 <danayo> ha
2017-09-25T21:04:15 * clown has quit
2017-09-25T21:05:40 <danayo> Jess_: this discussion brings to mind a time when a Vancouver mayor tried living in a cardboard box for 3 days so that he would "know what it\'s like to be homeless"
2017-09-25T21:06:16 <Jess_> yep. or the anthro students who get jobs at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s to see how it feels to have a full-time job that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually let you pay rent and eat
2017-09-25T21:06:47 * avtar1 joined the channel
2017-09-25T21:07:14 <colinclark> danayo: my favourite variant on that one is the silicon valley CEOs who "experienced homeless using VR headsets" :P
2017-09-25T21:07:30 <Jess_> i think the balance you mention above danayo is what all \xe2\x80\x98designers\xe2\x80\x99 should grapple with.
2017-09-25T21:08:28 <Jess_> rather than the satisfaction of making a great design decision, the questions should be: 1. who did i just exclude? 2. did i intorduce any new incidious assumptions, etc.
2017-09-25T21:08:31 <danayo> OMG colinclark
2017-09-25T21:10:09 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-09-25T21:10:35 <danayo> +1 Jess_ , I would add 3. who can I bring to the table (and how)?
2017-09-25T21:10:50 <Jess_> danayo: OH YES the TABLE!
2017-09-25T21:10:54 <Jess_> a very important 3
2017-09-25T21:11:04 <Jess_> with Jan\xe2\x80\x99s caveat re: the mores of the table and such
2017-09-25T21:11:42 <colinclark> And I think more importantly, how I can I design ways for people to create their own table and invite whoever they want to it
2017-09-25T21:12:05 <Jess_> yes! the community-building/capacity building piece
2017-09-25T21:12:06 <colinclark> this is the really crucial distinction that I think danayo has pointed out in regards to Sanders\' work on creative design tools
2017-09-25T21:12:10 <danayo> YES colinclark
2017-09-25T21:12:15 <colinclark> they stop at a point in the design process
2017-09-25T21:12:26 <colinclark> I don\'t think capacity-building is quite the right word
2017-09-25T21:12:41 <colinclark> that\'s part of it
2017-09-25T21:13:05 <colinclark> but there\'s also an aspect, with design for ICT, of providing ways for users to create within the system
2017-09-25T21:13:13 <colinclark> so UI Options being our first little glimmer of that idea in practice
2017-09-25T21:13:29 <colinclark> by allowing them to rearrange, redesign, or change it in some way
2017-09-25T21:14:00 <Jess_> yes, the user-continued design idea \xe2\x80\x94 i was referring more to a company or a group or a team or the soccer folks \xe2\x80\x94 they can build their own community of practice of co-design. they have all the tools and techniques. they have great ideas, they have prototypes
2017-09-25T21:14:02 <colinclark> so we imagine extending the role of "make tools" into the whole design lifetime, and then into its afterlife :)
2017-09-25T21:14:11 <colinclark> right
2017-09-25T21:14:15 <colinclark> that\'s great
2017-09-25T21:14:38 <colinclark> I have that funny version of Sanders\' "messy front end" diagram
2017-09-25T21:14:41 <colinclark> I\'ll have to dig it up
2017-09-25T21:14:45 <Jess_> cool, good stuff all. i\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to tomorrow
2017-09-25T21:14:52 <Jess_> see you then
2017-09-25T21:14:58 * Jess_ has quit
2017-09-25T21:15:35 <danayo> it would be great to show that messy front end diagram tomorrow for sure colinclark
2017-09-25T21:15:45 <colinclark> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Presentations?preview=/1707985/137658426/About%20Us%20With%20Us%20-%20HCII%202016%20Presentation.pdf
2017-09-25T21:15:53 <colinclark> towards the end
2017-09-25T21:16:24 <colinclark> The diagram has Sanders\' "fuzzy front end" and then things smooth out, and then there is another wave of change
2017-09-25T21:16:47 <danayo> SO FUZZY
2017-09-25T21:16:48 <colinclark> personalized, end-user development, and user-continued design
2017-09-25T21:16:52 <danayo> I love it
2017-09-25T21:16:52 <colinclark> SUPER FUZZY
2017-09-25T21:16:54 <colinclark> :)
2017-09-25T21:24:19 <danayo> colinclark: did I ever mention that Jan led a session as part of the Rebulic of Inclusion once - in which they ended up using the entire session to re-design/co-design the actual table/set-up? I wish I could find the video footage - there was a livestream but I don\'t think they kept it up https://nac-cna.ca/en/cycle/inclusion
2017-09-25T21:25:13 <colinclark> incredible
2017-09-25T21:25:29 <colinclark> I recognize Barak in the photo at the top
2017-09-25T21:25:55 <danayo> oh cool, I don\'t know Barak
2017-09-25T21:27:00 <colinclark> the new Artistic Director at Tangled
2017-09-25T21:27:17 <danayo> oh right!
2017-09-25T21:32:06 <colinclark> it\'s funny, trying to place yourself on someone else\'s matrix
2017-09-25T21:32:45 <colinclark> Sanders\' matrix here has some interesting aspects, in terms of charting the relationship between "ethnographic" design and participatory design
2017-09-25T21:32:56 <colinclark> but I see a bit of our work in each corner of her matrix
2017-09-25T21:34:48 <danayo> which matrix are you referring to colinclark?
2017-09-25T21:35:00 <colinclark> oh, the one in the article the students apparently read
2017-09-25T21:35:04 <danayo> ah
2017-09-25T21:35:21 <colinclark> http://www.maketools.com/articles-papers/interactions20081112_dl.pdf
2017-09-25T21:35:23 <colinclark> page 14 here
2017-09-25T21:36:11 <danayo> that\'s true colinclark
2017-09-25T21:45:34 <colinclark> it is interesting the way she refers to "generative design" methods as being related to providing a shared "design language" that can be used both by participants and designers
2017-09-25T21:45:59 <colinclark> reminiscent of Christopher Alexnader\'s oft-overlooked goal with his design patterns
2017-09-25T21:46:14 <colinclark> it\'s funny how none of that made it into technology development or design
2017-09-25T21:46:33 <colinclark> the idea of an enabling language with which ordinary people could express their own designs
2017-09-25T21:46:50 <colinclark> in software, design patterns always look inwards to the developer or designer
2017-09-25T21:55:41 <danayo> colinclark: oh yeah, christopher alexander! forgot about that
2017-09-25T21:55:57 <colinclark> stuff gets co-opted so easily :)
2017-09-25T21:57:18 <danayo> that is interesting - that his work didn\'t make its way into tech
2017-09-25T21:58:01 <colinclark> I mean, it SEEMED like it did
2017-09-25T21:58:14 <colinclark> every programmer has head of "design patterns" and the "gang of four" and that kind of thing
2017-09-25T21:58:29 <colinclark> most designers have browsed through catalogues of UI design patterns
2017-09-25T21:59:00 <colinclark> but the idea that this was primarily "inhabitant"-facing (since Alexander was an architect) was just sort of completely lost
2017-09-25T21:59:09 <colinclark> UI design patterns are for designers to look at
2017-09-25T21:59:13 <danayo> yes
2017-09-25T21:59:20 <colinclark> the gang of four book is for programmers to read
2017-09-25T21:59:22 <colinclark> and so on
2017-09-25T22:03:36 <danayo> does Sanders identify specifics of that shared design language? I\'ll have to read that again

2017-09-25T16:01:52 <lliskovoi> thank you!
2017-09-25T16:04:38 <colinclark> danayo: Do you want some help for the discussion of co-design with Vera\'s class this week?
2017-09-25T16:05:16 <danayo> thanks colinclark, unfortunately I was planning to be away tomorrow afternoon - Jess_  :(
2017-09-25T16:05:24 <colinclark> aha
2017-09-25T16:09:58 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: I\xe2\x80\x99m sending out the design crit email. I have suggeted that the regular meeting is cancelled but there will be a meeting at 2:30 discussing the guide and co-design. Is that right?

2017-09-25T16:12:30 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ll not send the email then danayo, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can do this when you are available. Jess_ is it possible to reschedule that meeting?
2017-09-25T16:13:55 <danayo> that would be great sepidehshahi, but I think maybe they have a tour planned Jess_? or maybe I didn\'t hear that correctly
2017-09-25T16:16:22 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: danayo: they were going to swing by for a tour/chit chat \xe2\x80\x94 the students in SFI really rarely interact with the IDRC so it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice opportunity
2017-09-25T16:16:38 <Jess_> unfortunately danayo they can\xe2\x80\x99t reschedule :(
2017-09-25T16:17:01 <Jess_> that\xe2\x80\x99s a bummer
2017-09-25T16:17:08 <danayo> ok Jess_ thanks, and sorry to miss it!
2017-09-25T16:17:16 <danayo> a bummer indeed
2017-09-25T16:19:31 <danayo> please record the discussion for me Jess_ if possible
2017-09-25T16:19:52 <Jess_> danayo: sure!
2017-09-25T16:19:57 <sepidehshahi> sorry danayo, we will record it for sure
2017-09-25T16:20:28 <sepidehshahi> and if there is anything you want to be talked about in the meeting please let me know
2017-09-25T16:22:39 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi

2017-09-25T19:18:18 <danayo> great
2017-09-25T19:21:29 <lliskovoi> Jess_:, danayo, sepidehshahi, colinclark mind if I join the co-design discussion?
2017-09-25T19:21:39 <colinclark> yes please, lliskovoi :)
2017-09-25T19:22:00 <danayo> sounds good lliskovoi
2017-09-25T19:22:01 <lliskovoi> colinclark: :)
2017-09-25T19:22:15 <lliskovoi> standup room?
2017-09-25T19:26:48 <colinclark> seems like as good a place as any, sure

2017-09-25T20:10:58 <colinclark> sepidehshahi, danayo, lliskovoi, Jess_: The "improvisation as co-design" video with the Nexus musical instrument prototype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R_pz2Fz4qE
2017-09-25T20:11:09 <colinclark> The beginning and end both document performances
2017-09-25T20:11:27 <colinclark> and I think there\'s a lot, speculatively, to the idea of improvisation and play as an inclusive method
2017-09-25T20:12:29 <sepidehshahi> and here is the Nexus science lab video: https://youtu.be/NNwc0VYRhUU
2017-09-25T20:13:04 <colinclark> sepidehshahi, danayo, lliskovoi, Jess_: Which dovetails nicely into the create-a-thon and the idea of engaging in idea generation via play and construction. This Google Doc has links to video footage: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2SbiaJOmRAWsnucWSyPJ6v2iMdQKL1U28m_5GWWeYQ/edit
2017-09-25T20:13:25 <colinclark> Which look like they are all stored in our owncloud instance, which is great!
2017-09-25T20:13:36 <danayo> not sure how useful this is but here are notes from MyL3 co-design session https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Nov+21%2C+2016+-+Co-design+Session
2017-09-25T20:13:55 <colinclark> oh cool
2017-09-25T20:13:58 <danayo> and my brief reflection on it in an email (which I should add to wiki): We never really de-briefed after the session; it would be good to do that at some point. I\xe2\x80\x99m thoughtful about the process and how we might do it differently in future - perhaps by engaging him more in some sketching or other kind of play. I found it tricky once he started playing Minecraft to transition into something else - I think we would probably need a more structured kind of
2017-09-25T20:13:59 <danayo> design exercise or game, but not sure what that would look like yet. Interested to hear your thoughts. That said I do think we touched on some interesting ideas that we can definitely apply to our MyL3 design work.
2017-09-25T20:15:30 <colinclark> I\'m glad we were able to engage more in play and sketching in our follow up activities, danayo :)
2017-09-25T20:15:42 <danayo> exactly colinclark!
2017-09-25T20:15:44 <colinclark> you were very prescient in that summary
2017-09-25T20:15:50 <danayo> :)
2017-09-25T20:16:29 <lliskovoi> colinclark: I love the idea improvisation and play as an inclusive design method!
2017-09-25T20:16:37 <colinclark> :)
2017-09-25T20:17:37 <danayo> colinclark: I think we need to do some playing in the BiT session somehow
2017-09-25T20:17:47 <colinclark> I\'m just reading through the paper we didn\'t quite publish (my bad) regarding the sonification usability testing
2017-09-25T20:17:49 <colinclark> it\'s VERY good
2017-09-25T20:17:54 <danayo> oh cool
2017-09-25T20:17:55 <colinclark> danayo: that\'s a great idea, yes
2017-09-25T20:18:08 <sepidehshahi> yes dana\tthat\xe2\x80\x99s a really good idea
2017-09-25T20:18:29 <colinclark> fifteen people we worked with
2017-09-25T20:18:43 <sepidehshahi> that was less fun and more structured colinclark
2017-09-25T20:18:50 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-25T20:18:54 <colinclark> indeed it was :)
2017-09-25T20:19:04 <colinclark> but I think the takeaway from that experience was clear
2017-09-25T20:19:08 <sepidehshahi> although participants kept sketching and describing their ideas during the testing
2017-09-25T20:19:14 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-25T20:19:26 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-09-25T20:19:28 <colinclark> the importance of engaging participants in active interpretation
2017-09-25T20:19:42 <colinclark> it\'s precisely what the traditional industrial research design methods try to avoid
2017-09-25T20:20:55 <colinclark> the other thing is that, in our paper draft, we did a good job of preserving and presenting the participants\' own expressions
2017-09-25T20:21:08 <colinclark> so we have images of their sketches and lots of quotes of their interpretations
2017-09-25T20:21:17 <sepidehshahi> yes, we do
2017-09-25T20:21:49 <danayo> that\'s great colinclark, sepidehshahi - we done good! :)
2017-09-25T20:21:54 <colinclark> :)
2017-09-25T20:22:02 <sepidehshahi> ;)
2017-09-25T20:22:38 <colinclark> I\'m really impressed with our team\'s efforts to really make something out of co-design as a creative practice\xe2\x80\x94i.e. something we do as designers while designing :)
2017-09-25T20:22:41 <colinclark> because there\'s no handbook
2017-09-25T20:22:44 <colinclark> yet :P
2017-09-25T20:22:52 <colinclark> there\'s a guide
2017-09-25T20:22:55 <colinclark> but we had to write it :)
2017-09-25T20:23:47 <danayo> yes colinclark! speaking of which, these two guide entries probably speak most directly to our "creative community practice" https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/practices/WorkOpenly.html  https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/practices/CommunicateMultimodally.html
2017-09-25T20:24:01 <colinclark> oh yes
2017-09-25T20:24:09 <colinclark> those are great!
2017-09-25T20:24:43 <colinclark> Here\'s a link to our HCII 2016 paper about community-based inclusive design: https://github.com/colinbdclark/papers/blob/master/hcii-2016/hcii-2016.pdf
2017-09-25T20:24:54 <colinclark> or rather, the authors\' proof :)
2017-09-25T20:25:33 <danayo> nice colinclark, I need to read this again
2017-09-25T20:25:43 <colinclark> It does an okay job of tracing a kind of lineage of our approach to co-design, from Mace through Sanders and beyond
