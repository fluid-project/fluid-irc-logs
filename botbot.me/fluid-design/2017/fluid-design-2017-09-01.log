2017-09-01T14:29:02 <alanharnum> this is a really interesting piece on predicting technological change (with Blade Runner references): http://timharford.com/2017/08/what-we-get-wrong-about-technology/

2017-09-01T15:43:37 <jhung> clown_afk and Justin_o: there was a question in the PhET meeting. In the Ohm's Law sim there are 2 sliders which are logically grouped. http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/ohms-law/1.4.0-dev.9/ohms-law_en.html?accessibility What would you imagine to be an appropriate way of grouping the sliders?
2017-09-01T15:43:51 <jhung> One option considered was to use a <fieldset> with <legend>
2017-09-01T15:44:29 <Caren> jhung: is this relevant re: accessibility radio buttons and fieldsets https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/tests/test168.html
2017-09-01T15:44:53 <jhung> Another was to use a <section> with a header element to provide header-level navigation and not use a fieldset.

2017-09-01T16:35:53 <alanharnum> sometimes highly relatable meme: https://twitter.com/ADAMATOMIC/status/903439884500729856
2017-09-01T16:43:59 <clown> jhung, a difference between <section>/<hx> and <fieldset>/<legend> is that a section with a heading will be a landmark.
2017-09-01T16:44:33 <clown> a fieldset with a legend will just be a unit or group of controls, but not a landmark.
2017-09-01T16:44:55 <jhung> clown: yes. We see an advantage to having a landmark, but wondering if semantically it makes more sense to use a fieldset
2017-09-01T16:45:07 <clown> is it important for these sliders to be a landmark?  or important to *not* be a landmark.
2017-09-01T16:45:39 <clown> I'd have to think about it some more.
2017-09-01T16:46:12 <jhung> clown: it would be nice I think, since it would accommodate navigation by headers (which may be a common strategy for a screen reader user encountering a PhET sim for the first time).
2017-09-01T16:48:03 <clown> okay jhung.  It might be an empircal question and worth testing both scenarios with SR users to see what they find better.
2017-09-01T16:48:38 <clown> I have no strong opinion.  I just know what the question is.  :-)
2017-09-01T16:49:04 <jhung> clown: I see it that way as well. Was just curious to see if there was an opinion. :)
2017-09-01T16:51:19 <clown> jhung:  you might browse around the TPG or WebAIM pages to see if there are any opinions or rules of thumb there.  It might be like looking for a needle in a haystack, though.
2017-09-01T16:51:47 <jhung> clown: thanks!
2017-09-01T16:52:38 <clown> For example, https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?s=fieldset  But that's kind of old 2007.

2017-09-01T19:22:43 <Caren_> everyone: I have a question about alt text on graphics/images on the wiki. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been layering descriptive text into the wiki and not putting alt text in the graphics/images. Should I be doing both?
2017-09-01T19:24:13 <Caren_> is there a way to put alt text on a graphic/image in the wiki?
2017-09-01T19:24:40 <jhung> Caren_: traditionally we've been descriptive in the text. I don't think I've ever filled out alt text in the wiki\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-09-01T19:25:50 <Caren_> jhung: here is an example that prompted my question https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=144474290&draftShareId=edbc6914-b370-4417-b68a-1d1aa5326cc5
2017-09-01T19:27:47 <jhung> Caren_: that image is not actually an image. It appears to be a document (PDF?). So there's no Alt text option for that.
2017-09-01T19:28:56 <jhung> Caren_: if it were an image (and not a PDF), you would get a Properties button when you select the image in the wiki editor. From there you can fill out the alt text.
2017-09-01T19:30:06 <Caren_> Does it have to be a PNG to be read as an \xe2\x80\x9cimage\xe2\x80\x9d.
2017-09-01T19:30:30 <jhung> jpeg, png, etc.
2017-09-01T19:30:43 <Caren_> When I see it in the wiki it is rendering an image. But I guess that just a link image for the PDF?
2017-09-01T19:31:18 <jhung> Yes. The wiki is not giving us functionality to give alt text to a thumbnail of PDFs.
2017-09-01T19:32:11 <Caren_> Ok, so that said, do you think both is necessary? Alt text and the embedded descriptive text on the page?
2017-09-01T19:33:07 <jhung> Caren_: well it depends. Alt text is usually short and not overly descriptive. So text descriptions outside of the image can provide additional information that won't fit in alt text.
2017-09-01T19:34:50 <Caren_> ok, that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful. Thanks so much jhung!
2017-09-01T19:35:45 <jhung> no prob Caren_!
