2017-09-06T13:03:01 <sepidehshahi> Good morning jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m still using CS6 on my machine. Bert mentioned you may know how to upgrade to CC
2017-09-06T13:03:35 <jhung> Let me find you the instructions sepidehshahi
2017-09-06T13:04:10 <sepidehshahi> thanks jhung
2017-09-06T13:06:42 <jhung> sepidehshahi: it would appear that we need OCAD to add IDRC staff individually. Colin helped coordinate this for us.
2017-09-06T13:07:25 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I can send you the original email colinclark sent back in Feb. You may need to ask him to go through his channel to get you added.
2017-09-06T13:07:26 <sepidehshahi> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Colin today.
2017-09-06T13:07:53 <sepidehshahi> that would be great! thanks
2017-09-06T13:12:31 <jhung> sepidehshahi: sent an email CC\'ing you and colinclark.

2017-09-06T18:09:23 <danayo_> fluid-everyone: this is the biodiversity project I mentioned at standup - will see if I can get Andrew to come and talk about it at a community meeting re: citizen research and community engagement http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/biodiversity-galiano-island
2017-09-06T18:10:28 <Jess_> danayo_: so cool!
2017-09-06T18:11:03 <danayo_> totally!
2017-09-06T18:12:45 <colinclark> That will make for a great community meeting, danayo_
2017-09-06T18:12:58 <danayo_> also interesting to look at the dashboard Jess_, and process of uploading observations
2017-09-06T18:13:20 <colinclark> iNaturalist was one of the platform that Jenny Preece highlighted in her  keynote about citizen science last summer at HCII
2017-09-06T18:13:24 <Jess_> danayo_: and export!
2017-09-06T18:13:32 <colinclark> http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/march-april-2017/how-two-billion-smartphone-users-can-save-species
2017-09-06T18:13:45 <danayo_> oh cool colinclark! really hope I can convince him to come speak
2017-09-06T18:13:59 <colinclark> let me know if I can help :)
2017-09-06T18:14:35 <danayo_> thanks
2017-09-06T18:16:42 <danayo_> I\'m assuming Andrew must know about Jennifer\'s work - but I\'ll pass it on just in case colinclark
2017-09-06T18:17:50 <colinclark> Cool

2017-09-06T18:28:06 <danayo_> nice ussjoin
2017-09-06T18:28:37 <danayo_> San Juans?
2017-09-06T18:29:07 <simonjb> super-cool danayo_
2017-09-06T18:29:11 <ussjoin> And iNaturalist had me at "you can take photos of stuff and we will tell you what it is." That\'s *super* helpful for me, since I grew up in Montana but live in the PNW now---and it turns out that if you have water, you get a whole *bunch* of species of plants and animals that don\'t fit into the set of {pine tree, cow, bee} that grows in Montana.
2017-09-06T18:29:25 <ussjoin> danayo_ Yes.
