2017-05-18T14:34:53 <Caren> hi. does anyone know where I might find the wiki that houses the information collected from the DEEP A11Y hackathons: http://hackathon.inclusivedesign.ca ?
2017-05-18T15:00:02 <Caren> The concept of \xe2\x80\x9cdecompressed design\xe2\x80\x9d being explored by NYU student Skylar Jessen is quite interesting. Taking back technology and having it work for/with us and not against us? https://www.decompressed.design/ http://tinyurl.com/mdzlv6g
2017-05-18T15:02:37 <Jess_> Caren: re: the DEEP hackathon, i just looked here and only see the \xe2\x80\x98virtual notebooks\xe2\x80\x99 from the sessions: http://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/deep-2016/
2017-05-18T15:02:58 <Jess_> Caren: do you hve David\xe2\x80\x99s contact information \xe2\x80\x94 he would know if anyone would where the hackathon work is

2017-05-18T15:22:13 <danayo> Caren: that decompressed design is pretty interesting. I say YES to auto-disabling devices during an important conversation! can\'t figure out why it\'s a lamp tho - I guess it let\'s you know when it\'s active? thereby also letting you know that you\'re having an important conversation :)

2017-05-18T16:27:03 <colinclark> Caren: I\'d love to talk with you sometime next week about strategies for sharing insights gathered from codesign events like the create-a-thon we did the other week
2017-05-18T16:27:19 <colinclark> perhaps a few of us can get together to talk through some ideas
2017-05-18T16:27:49 <colinclark> I was thinking this morning about a paper that was flagged for me by Karen Holtzblatt, who was the co-creator of the "Contextual Inquiry" methods
2017-05-18T16:28:09 <colinclark> and how she continually frames the experience of the user as a kind of "data" for design teams
2017-05-18T16:28:15 <Caren> colinclark: yes please! would you like me to organize that?
2017-05-18T16:28:34 <colinclark> her emphasis is always on modelling individuals, which I think is interesting and troublesome in some interesting ways
2017-05-18T16:28:39 * Caren joined the channel
2017-05-18T16:28:43 <colinclark> Her latest is about "representing" users
2017-05-18T16:29:04 <colinclark> and I was thinking about the difference between "representation" and "expression"
2017-05-18T16:29:14 * danayo has quit
2017-05-18T16:29:30 <colinclark> the former is almost always instrumental\xe2\x80\x94we try to model and summarize and essentialize users, forming representations like personas
2017-05-18T16:30:00 <colinclark> whereas I think I\'m much more interested in expression\xe2\x80\x94giving individuals a voice throughout the design process to express their thoughts, ideas, desires, even goals
2017-05-18T16:30:06 <colinclark> as opposed to sort of modelling them away into artefacts
2017-05-18T16:30:12 <colinclark> so it could be an interesting brainstorming session
2017-05-18T16:30:21 <colinclark> yes, if you\'ve got time to organize something, that would be awesome

2017-05-18T16:54:46 <Jess_> hey fluid-everyone: anyone going to be in the office tomorrow 9:30 a.m.?
2017-05-18T16:55:40 <clown> Jess_  it\'s likely I\'ll be here.  I have to drop off my car in the morning, so I might be later.
2017-05-18T16:56:17 <Jess_> clown: thanks! no worries if you might be later
2017-05-18T16:56:45 <clown> Jess_  whazzup?
2017-05-18T16:57:15 <Jess_> clown: if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, I can come in and handle it \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s just a call into the collab room
2017-05-18T16:58:02 <clown> Jess_  okay, I\'ll contact you here as soon as I get here.  Is that good enough?
2017-05-18T16:58:23 <clown> I guess it depends on how far away you are.
2017-05-18T16:58:57 <Jess_> clown: don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it \xe2\x80\x94 have your morning. i\xe2\x80\x99ll handle it!
2017-05-18T16:59:53 <clown> Jess_  okay.  *stops worrying*
2017-05-18T17:00:02 <Jess_> excellent
