2017-08-23T14:49:51 <jhung> Jess_, Justin_o, michelled: I was wondering if it made more sense for the news archive page on the FLOE site to be a list of links to articles instead of a duplication of the news items themselves.
2017-08-23T14:50:00 <jhung> http://floeproject.org/news/
2017-08-23T14:51:07 <michelled> jhung: I think Jutta had wanted an at a glance view of the news on the front page? I\'m not sure. maybe dana remembers
2017-08-23T14:52:12 <jhung> ok. I\'ll ask danayotte when she\'s around.

2017-08-23T15:28:48 <Justin_o> it\'s about UIO+ and the spinner
2017-08-23T15:28:57 <danayo> sure Justin_o
2017-08-23T15:29:02 <danayo> after standup?
2017-08-23T15:29:02 <Justin_o> is now okay?
2017-08-23T15:29:07 <Justin_o> sure that will also work
2017-08-23T15:30:14 <Justin_o> danayo: i just e-mailed you the UIO+ extension, it\'ll probably be easier for you to see if you install it yourself
2017-08-23T15:30:23 <Justin_o> i don\'t think the screen share will be fast enough
2017-08-23T15:31:20 <danayo> ok thanks Justin_o
2017-08-23T15:31:27 <Caren> Hi jhung and everyone: I\xe2\x80\x99ve started writing up a summary of process, findings and next steps for PhET Energy Skate Park. Input and feedback most welcome: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0yhgYasoVQiYVlEPrP6YhNohV88LdiJGFLEzHHim2Q/edit?usp=sharing
2017-08-23T15:33:01 <jhung> Awesome thanks Caren. I\'ll take a look at this later this week. Maybe tomorrow?
2017-08-23T15:40:20 <Caren> thanks, Jon. That would be great.

2017-08-23T15:52:15 <Justin_o> danayo: you can drag and drop it into the chrome://extensions page

2017-08-23T17:36:46 <jessm> alanharnum: re: SJRK coming to TO \xe2\x80\x94 do we have a date/time?
2017-08-23T17:36:54 <danayo> hi jessm
2017-08-23T17:37:07 <jessm> pat is asking, as she goes on vacation for two weeks tomorrow, and we need to reserve the room if so danayo alanharnum
2017-08-23T17:37:15 <danayo> Oct 13
2017-08-23T17:37:17 <danayo> Friday
2017-08-23T17:37:22 <jessm> danayo: you\xe2\x80\x99re coming in too, right?
2017-08-23T17:37:26 <danayo> yep
2017-08-23T17:37:35 <jessm> danayo: and should we reserve the collab room for the day?
2017-08-23T17:37:53 <alanharnum> jessm: yes, i\'d want to make sure we have it
2017-08-23T17:38:26 <danayo> unless we want to use a different room for any reason, but I think that\'s best
2017-08-23T17:38:31 <jessm> alanharnum: danayo: ok, Pat is going to reserve 7220, the collab room for friday, oct 13
2017-08-23T17:39:43 <alanharnum> jessm danayo: great - thank you for that!
2017-08-23T17:41:40 <jessm> alanharnum: danayo: morning of someone should run to Timmies and get some coffee (keep your receipt!) and Pat will make sure that the group of 6 invitees and approx. 4 more from IDRC project team have lunch delivered
2017-08-23T17:45:06 <danayo> sounds good jessm, thanks
2017-08-23T17:45:19 <jessm> \xe2\x88\x9a
2017-08-23T17:45:27 <danayo> (does it have to be Timmies though :)
2017-08-23T17:46:05 <jessm> danayo: hahhaha, \xe2\x80\x9cTimmies\xe2\x80\x9d where the value in \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d is a purveyor of hot/brown/black liquid gold
2017-08-23T17:46:36 <danayo> :)
2017-08-23T17:46:39 <alanharnum> "Timmies".replace("Timmies", "Hot Black")
2017-08-23T17:46:46 <danayo> hahaha
2017-08-23T17:46:51 <jessm> ;) knew that was coming
2017-08-23T17:47:07 <jessm> continuous improvement!
2017-08-23T17:47:09 <jessm> iterating!
2017-08-23T17:47:13 <jessm> agile!
2017-08-23T17:48:05 <danayo> "Hot Black".replace("Hot Black", "Little Nicky\'s") ??

2017-08-23T17:59:12 <mrtyler> i was wondering why "mcdonald\'s" was spelled wrong
2017-08-23T18:00:03 <mrtyler> figured it was canadian english striking again :)
2017-08-23T18:00:27 <mrtyler> MacDounaulds
2017-08-23T18:05:39 <jhung> mrtyler: :) We just like throwing random letters in to make it look old timey.

2017-08-23T18:11:43 <jhung> danayo: I almost forgot to ask you. Do you remember why the news index on the Floe site contains all the articles instead of a list of links? http://floeproject.org/news/
2017-08-23T18:12:47 <danayo> good question jhung, I don\'t know if there was a reason
2017-08-23T18:13:00 <danayo> I think it would make more sense to have a list of links
2017-08-23T18:16:03 <jhung> Do you remember if Jutta wanted it this way? i.e. so all news was visible at a glance? I don\'t recall.
2017-08-23T18:16:10 <jhung> ^danayo
2017-08-23T18:17:36 <danayo> I really don\'t remember any discussion about it jhung. looking at it again, I wonder ... maybe it\'s better like this so you can see it all at a glance
2017-08-23T18:18:30 <jhung> danayo: but if the titles of the links are descriptive enough (as they should be), is it necessary? I just wonder because that index page is getting long and it\'s increasingly harder to maintain.
2017-08-23T18:19:20 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-23T18:19:30 <danayo> yeah. that\'s true jhung.
2017-08-23T18:20:41 <danayo> i\'m wavering, not helpful! maybe we need a 3rd opinion on this one
2017-08-23T18:20:56 <danayo> it will get very long
2017-08-23T18:21:50 <jhung> Maybe this should go into the fluid-work list danayo?
2017-08-23T18:22:21 <danayo> sounds good jhung
