2017-07-12T15:45:20 <alanharn_> Jess_: insufficiently inclusive pipes
2017-07-12T15:47:11 <Jess_> alanharn_: it\xe2\x80\x99s what happens when the \xe2\x80\x9cpipes get clogged\xe2\x80\x9d remember that US politician from Alaska I think who called slow internet the result of clogged pipes?!
2017-07-12T15:47:30 <alanharn_> Jess_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes
2017-07-12T15:47:38 <Jess_> YES! alanharn_
2017-07-12T15:50:37 <alanharn_> "Digital Meeting Undone By Failure of Literal Series of Tubes"
2017-07-12T15:51:03 <Jess_> lol \xe2\x80\x94 would have been a good headline for the St. Catharines news last night :P
2017-07-12T15:52:04 <Jess_> i can only hope that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing the participants will remember from the two days!

2017-07-12T18:36:55 <lliskovoi> everyone: I just discovered the Adobe Capture CC app (iPhone), if you haven\'t played with it yet, it\'s incredibly fun and useful!
2017-07-12T18:40:42 <Jess_> fluid-everyone: i think Vidyo Neo is not connecting to our two physical rooms \xe2\x80\x94 might be related to sharing content and might be related to the rooms themselves

2017-07-12T20:04:57 <danayo> alanharnum: i\xe2\x80\x99ve put all the partner summaries at the top of this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKqivtNYQ2BjlZJHtdslwqrMVRqHEVVJDVhYRU3Oaj8/edit?usp=sharing
2017-07-12T20:05:07 <danayo> i think they may still be too long
2017-07-12T20:06:10 <danayo> also I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to write about Catalina\xe2\x80\x99s work, so left it quite general

2017-07-12T20:12:39 <danayo> thanks alanharnum. do you think will we have something to show the partners today (i.e. on the site), or should I just send the blurbs out on their own to get their approval ?

2017-07-12T20:13:34 <alanharnum> danayo: I\'d send the blurbs on their own - I\'m going to try and push up the new site skeleton by 6:00 EST, but if you want to send separately, go ahead
2017-07-12T20:14:19 <danayo> ok

2017-07-12T20:19:14 <danayo> also, i was thinking of reducing the page/nav headers to one word each - like so https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/Sq8fjPzw4sonjjo
2017-07-12T20:19:35 <danayo> alanharnum^
2017-07-12T20:20:29 <alanharnum> danayo: I like that idea - the only one I think might be a bit ambiguous is "activity". but not sure of what\'s better to use that isn\'t "News", which we want to avoid.
2017-07-12T20:22:07 <danayo> yeah
2017-07-12T20:22:45 <danayo> Happenings?
2017-07-12T20:23:15 <danayo> maybe a bit strange
2017-07-12T20:26:43 <danayo> if it includes meeting notes and work plans, Activity still makes most sense to me. Maybe we can\xe2\x80\x99t avoid Recent Activity alanharnum
2017-07-12T20:27:03 <alanharnum> danayo: we can definitely use just Activity for now
2017-07-12T20:34:34 <danayo> Jess_: can you take a quick look at these summaries and let me know what you think? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to send to list too to get partner\xe2\x80\x99s feedback before we post onto site. Catalina\xe2\x80\x99s is pretty skeletal, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what to add there. the idea is to have short blurbs and then link to more info on the wiki https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKqivtNYQ2BjlZJHtdslwqrMVRqHEVVJDVhYRU3Oaj8/edit?usp=sharing
