2017-04-13T16:28:05 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I came across this company which is providing ways to set personal preferences and have it apply to websites you visit. The webapp can be found here: https://ws.facil-iti.com/. The company site is here http://www.facil-iti.com/
2017-04-13T16:28:30 <jhung> Also worth noting the Privacy policy on the site: https://ws.facil-iti.com/mentions-legales.html

2017-04-13T16:31:18 <jhung> There are a number of word choices I would amend.
2017-04-13T16:31:47 <jhung> "FACIL\xe2\x80\x99iti is a seamless interface that works on an existing web site, improving the browsing experience to meet the needs of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s particular condition. It is completely customizable and adaptive, while preserving the original code of the web site."
2017-04-13T16:31:55 <Bosmon> Yeah
2017-04-13T16:31:57 <jhung> Does any of that sound familiar? :)
2017-04-13T16:32:00 <Bosmon> Such as .... "condition" :)
2017-04-13T16:32:05 <Bosmon> Terrible
2017-04-13T16:34:24 <Bosmon> We may as well be in the 50s

2017-04-13T19:19:10 <jhung_busy> fluid-everyone: since I will be away next week, I would like to sort out next week\'s design crit today if possible. Are there any topics you would like to discuss?
2017-04-13T19:19:34 <Justin_o_> not from me
2017-04-13T19:26:03 <danayo> not that I can think of jhung_busy
2017-04-13T19:27:34 <jhung_busy> danayo (and fluid-everyone) I will send out an email to cancel it, but feel free to schedule something in my absence.
2017-04-13T19:28:20 <danayo> thanks jhung_busy
2017-04-13T19:41:47 <danayo> alanharnum, simonjb: forgot to ask - does the Nexus analysis tool currently offer different sonification options for each data set?
2017-04-13T19:42:18 <alanharnum> danayo: no, but it hopefully will after this weekend for the different sensors
2017-04-13T19:42:29 <alanharnum> colinclark is doing some sound design
2017-04-13T19:42:54 <danayo> ok cool alanharnum, thanks
