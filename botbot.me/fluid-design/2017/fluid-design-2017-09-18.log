2017-09-18T13:16:52 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: this is great! you have done an amazing job in such short time!! If we could vertically mirror the table of content and line spacing icons, all the rest of icons are fine the way they are
2017-09-18T13:40:33 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: that\'s easy - should the contrast one be flipped as well?
2017-09-18T13:41:04 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: that still makes sense the way it is
2017-09-18T13:41:08 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2017-09-18T13:44:20 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: OK - is there anything else that looks "off" about it, especially compared to the left-to-right version? I can see that some of the margin around the icons should be reversed (not yet sure what RTL does and doesn\'t do automatically in terms of layout conversion, but doesn\'t appear to be mirroring the icon margins automatically, making them crush up against the headings on RTL)
2017-09-18T13:48:13 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-18T13:48:20 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: the tab for \xe2\x80\x98show display preferences\xe2\x80\x99 could go to the left so the Hello World phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xd8\xb3\xd9\x84\xd8\xa7\xd9\x85, \xd8\xaf\xd9\x86\xdb\x8c\xd8\xa7\xe2\x80\x9d could be aligned to the rignt side. as you also mentioned, the only other thing I can find is the icon\xe2\x80\x99s margin that is not flipped. the rest looks fine to me
2017-09-18T13:50:03 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: ah, I see what you mean - makes sense. assume on an RTL layout it is logical that UI elements like hide/show that are meant to be right-aligned in a LTR way (and therefore out of the natural reading flow) should be reversed.
2017-09-18T13:50:33 <sepidehshahi> exactly

2017-09-18T14:11:14 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: OK, implemented all that - http://rawgit.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual/master/demos/index_fa.html
2017-09-18T14:12:32 <Justin_o> jhung: hello
2017-09-18T14:13:06 <jhung> got a minute to chat? I have a git question for you Justin_o
2017-09-18T14:14:50 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: Perfect! is it possible to change the color of the \xe2\x80\x98show preference\xe2\x80\x99 tab so you can see the white divider between \xe2\x80\x98hide\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98reset\xe2\x80\x99 for all three demos? right now it looks like one button.
2017-09-18T14:16:00 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, i should have time
2017-09-18T14:16:33 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: should be - another issue I see (which I\'m looking at now as well) is that when you turn on the ToC, it doesn\'t translate the actual "Table of Contents" string on the page
2017-09-18T14:22:36 <sepidehshahi> It\xe2\x80\x99s not working on the Farsi demo,  I thought it\xe2\x80\x99s not implemented
2017-09-18T14:24:10 <sepidehshahi> because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything in French and English demo either
2017-09-18T14:24:40 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: yeah, I realized this was a problem because I realized the ToC was broken :) then i fixed it and saw the translation issue

2017-09-18T14:26:25 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I haven\'t pushed up a fix yet, sorry
2017-09-18T14:26:45 <sepidehshahi> oh ok :)

2017-09-18T14:42:17 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: OK, fixed the ToC translation issue
2017-09-18T14:42:47 <alanharnum> this is really valuable, as I think it\'s surfacing various issues with translating UIO now rather than later
2017-09-18T14:43:16 <sepidehshahi> now it\xe2\x80\x99s working fine. Thanks alanharnum
