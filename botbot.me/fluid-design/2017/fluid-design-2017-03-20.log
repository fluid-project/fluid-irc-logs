2017-03-20T13:23:53 <jhung> Justin_o:  I figured out the problem. I was using a version with internal CSS.
2017-03-20T13:24:24 <jhung> Justin_o: so if I switch to one with inline CSS, the colours come back.
2017-03-20T13:25:20 <Justin_o> :)
2017-03-20T13:30:25 <jhung> Oh and I just remembered something Justin_o. The SVG <use> method is only good for SVGs of a single colour. So it won't work for the lightbulb graphic.
2017-03-20T13:30:31 <jhung> I'll have to embed it.
2017-03-20T13:30:53 <jhung> Or I guess I can use a background\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-03-20T13:31:10 <Justin_o> jhung: FF will support <use> for those, but for others you won't get the default styles working properly
2017-03-20T13:31:31 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, a background could work

2017-03-20T15:11:47 <jhung> Caren and I were talking about doing a workshop / hackathon for PhET. We were wondering if we can pick your brains about how we might structure one. We're going to try to incorporate the time with the co-op students as well Jess_. Would there be a time between now and Wednesday to chat about this?
2017-03-20T15:12:41 <Jess_> sure! that sounds cool. would love to chat jhung and Caren. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the office tomorrow and will be free all afternoon. does that work for you two?
2017-03-20T15:13:36 <jhung> Jess_: tomorrow afternoon I'
2017-03-20T15:13:43 <Jess_> it\xe2\x80\x99s good timing too. i have a convo with soem folks from teh open textbook network at UMINN on Thursday about structuring events.
2017-03-20T15:13:44 <jhung> m booked from 1-3p.
2017-03-20T15:14:01 <Jess_> jhung: anytime 11-1?
2017-03-20T15:14:30 <Jess_> oh wait! jhung i was looking at next week\xe2\x80\xa6 Morning is better on Tuesday
2017-03-20T15:14:30 <jhung> Yeah that works. 11-1p works.
2017-03-20T15:15:07 <jhung> Tuesday the only thing scheduled in the mornings are the crits and stand-up.
2017-03-20T15:15:26 <jhung> So maybe 9a work Jess_ and Caren?
2017-03-20T15:15:29 <Caren> jhung and Jess_ 11-1p works for me too\xe2\x80\xa6save the crits and stand-up
2017-03-20T15:15:44 <Jess_> yes, i can do on either end \xe2\x80\x94 9a or after the crit at 11
2017-03-20T15:16:31 <Caren> after crit at 11 is my vote.
2017-03-20T15:16:32 <jhung> is 9a okay with you both? Sometimes the crit goes past 11a.
2017-03-20T15:17:31 <Caren> I may have a conflict with child care but go ahead and I will join if I can. :-)
2017-03-20T15:18:02 <jhung> Caren: ah. Ok. Then let's make it 11a then.
2017-03-20T15:18:23 <jhung> Jess_ and Caren: so 11a tomorrow. :)
