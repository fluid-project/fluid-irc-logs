b"2017-06-06T20:01:10 <danayo> maybe that's what we should do Justin_o, as long as we can make sure that the contrast is high enough
2017-06-06T20:01:32 <danayo> meaning, make the link text a different colour
2017-06-06T20:02:24 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, i'll give that a shot..
2017-06-06T20:04:49 <Justin_o> danayo: https://jsfiddle.net/tnx5b8q3/5/
2017-06-06T20:04:55 <Justin_o> updated the second paragraph again
2017-06-06T20:05:06 <Justin_o> that has a 4.5:1 contrast for the link when highlighted
2017-06-06T20:05:15 <Justin_o> but it's pretty much indistinguishable from the black text
2017-06-06T20:05:33 <danayo> it is
2017-06-06T20:05:37 <danayo> i thought it was black
2017-06-06T20:05:59 <danayo> we'll have a limited number of colour options, right Justin_o ?
2017-06-06T20:06:22 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, if we wan't to maintain a WCAG AA contrast
2017-06-06T20:07:06 <danayo> I wonder, if there are certain colours that pass WCAG AA with both black and white text?
2017-06-06T20:07:14 <danayo> background colours I mean
2017-06-06T20:07:31 <Justin_o> danayo: that's intersting
2017-06-06T20:07:33 <Justin_o> i wonder
2017-06-06T20:08:30 <danayo> looks like 894eff does Justin_o
2017-06-06T20:09:53 <danayo> also 4169f0
2017-06-06T20:10:22 <Justin_o> danayo: if you can find any for green and yellow that would be awesome
2017-06-06T20:10:26 <danayo> ok
2017-06-06T20:10:31 <danayo> this is fun :)
2017-06-06T20:10:47 <danayo> yellow will be hard, I reckon
2017-06-06T20:11:03 <Justin_o> yes, probably.. i guess it can be more orange
2017-06-06T20:11:30 <Justin_o> i was also going to do a highlights in both pink and purple, but i guess just one is fine
2017-06-06T20:11:41 <danayo> yes, or with something like yellow, the blue text is ok, so we could leave it?
2017-06-06T20:11:50 <danayo> blue text is probably ok i mean - i'll check it
2017-06-06T20:12:51 <danayo> red: eb150e
2017-06-06T20:13:59 <Justin_o> danayo: by the way, this is the yellow i'm using eecc62
2017-06-06T20:14:44 <danayo> ok
2017-06-06T20:14:52 <danayo> here's a green that works. it was right on the edge 318712
2017-06-06T20:14:59 <Justin_o> Looks like this blue 203bd6 will work with it
2017-06-06T20:15:07 <danayo> cool
2017-06-06T20:15:43 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2017-06-06T20:15:49 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo, lliskovoi: thanks for all the help
2017-06-06T20:15:59 <danayo> Justin_o: you could go with a brighter yellow if you're using that blue
2017-06-06T20:16:20 <Justin_o> danayo: any suggestions?
2017-06-06T20:17:02 <danayo> something like this Justin_o eeee1a
2017-06-06T20:17:09 * michelled joined the channel
2017-06-06T20:18:06 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks, it's like a highlighter
2017-06-06T20:18:12 <danayo> yes
2017-06-06T20:19:55 <danayo> here's a pink that works Justin_o de00a2
2017-06-06T20:20:27 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks, do you prefer the pink or the red that you suggested
2017-06-06T20:20:36 <Justin_o> or i could have both as options
2017-06-06T20:20:51 <danayo> i prefer the pink Justin_o
2017-06-06T20:21:13 <danayo> seems like more of a highlighting colour
2017-06-06T20:21:15 <danayo> but we could have both
2017-06-06T20:21:33 <Justin_o> i'll go with the pink for now then

2017-06-06T16:50:20 <Jess_> High Sierra The company also is opening its Photo Book printing service to third-party apps https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-announces-macos-high-sierra/
2017-06-06T16:50:39 <Jess_> it\xe2\x80\x99s what the guys on the PressBooks call were talking about \xe2\x80\x94 potentially a game changer for content producers
2017-06-06T16:50:47 <Jess_> i think it also exports to different file types

2017-06-06T19:12:40 <Justin_o> jhung: so i was looking at the selection highlighting..
2017-06-06T19:13:11 <Justin_o> the problem with changing the for ground is that it really does remove the visual indicator of links if they are only indicated by colour
2017-06-06T19:13:35 <Justin_o> we are supposed to be able to control text-decoration, but it doesn't seem to be working in chrome
2017-06-06T19:13:41 * colinclark has quit
2017-06-06T19:13:51 <Justin_o> i was hoping to add an underline in the selection highlight for links :(
2017-06-06T19:16:31 <jhung> Justin_o: :( that's too bad.
2017-06-06T19:19:04 <jhung> Justin_o: i'd like to get the opinion of others in this case.
2017-06-06T19:19:53 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, agreed...
2017-06-06T19:20:28 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-06-06T19:20:59 <Justin_o> danayo, lliskovoi, anyone else: I'm implementing an enactor to change the colour of the selection highlighting on a web page.. the thing is that it needs to work on any page...
2017-06-06T19:21:26 <Justin_o> the main issue that I have a question about now is if we should change the highlight and the text colour that is being selected, or just the highlight
2017-06-06T19:21:49 <Justin_o> if just the highlight, if the text is a similar colour, it is hard to read.
2017-06-06T19:21:50 <danayo> i think for it to work anywhere Justin_o, it would have to include both
2017-06-06T19:21:55 <danayo> exactly
2017-06-06T19:22:14 <Justin_o> if the foreground is also changed, you lose any distinction for links, if they are only based on colour
2017-06-06T19:22:28 <Justin_o> also if there are other important information contained in the colour only
2017-06-06T19:22:47 <danayo> but it will only be changed when highlighted, right Justin_o
2017-06-06T19:22:50 <danayo> hmmm
2017-06-06T19:22:54 <Justin_o> danayo: that's correct
2017-06-06T19:23:06 <Justin_o> danayo: i'll make a quick jsfiddle demo
2017-06-06T19:23:10 <danayo> cool
2017-06-06T19:24:07 <danayo> i guess the highlighting isn't necessaritly paired with TTS, is that right Justin_o? I was wondering if TTS would read out the link label
2017-06-06T19:25:01 <lliskovoi> Justin_o: would be great to see an example
2017-06-06T19:25:59 <Justin_o> danayo: correct, it's not necessarily paired with text to speech... this is actually just to change the default selection highlighting that the browser provides
2017-06-06T19:32:17 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo, lliskovoi: here's an example https://jsfiddle.net/tnx5b8q3/
2017-06-06T19:32:31 <Justin_o> just use your mouse to select the text in the three paragraphs
2017-06-06T19:33:20 <Justin_o> paragraph one changes only the highlight, paragraph two changes the highlight and text color, and paragraph three is the default browser behaviour
2017-06-06T19:34:34 <lliskovoi> Justin_o: all three are behaving the same when I try it
2017-06-06T19:34:54 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: really :(
2017-06-06T19:34:57 <Justin_o> which browser?
2017-06-06T19:35:08 <lliskovoi> just tried it in Chrome and it worked
2017-06-06T19:35:10 <jhung> Same Justin_o. Usig FF.
2017-06-06T19:35:16 <lliskovoi> but in firefox it's all the same
2017-06-06T19:35:24 <danayo> me too
2017-06-06T19:35:29 <Justin_o> jhung, lliskovoi, danayo : it doesn't work in FF yet
2017-06-06T19:35:36 <Justin_o> i could make it work there though if you like.. one second
2017-06-06T19:35:42 <Justin_o> FF uses a vendor prefix
2017-06-06T19:35:43 <danayo> Justin_o: is there any way we could add an underline for links?
2017-06-06T19:36:03 <danayo> when highlighting I mean
2017-06-06T19:36:21 <danayo> so that we can make the text visible but still indicate a link
2017-06-06T19:37:10 <Justin_o> jhung, lliskovoi, danayo : now should be working in FF too https://jsfiddle.net/tnx5b8q3/1/
2017-06-06T19:37:32 <lliskovoi> danayo: I think that's a great idea. I prefer the second paragraph, but it would be tricky with links and other colour info
2017-06-06T19:37:41 <lliskovoi> another reason not to use colour alone ;)
2017-06-06T19:37:45 <Justin_o> danayo: i was hoping to do that, and you are supposed to be able to, but chrome doesn't seem to respect the styling.. i'm guessing it hasn't implemented it yet
2017-06-06T19:45:14 <Justin_o> danayo, lliskovoi: i think the only things that are working to change right now are the background-color (highlight), color (text color), text-shadow
2017-06-06T19:45:58 <lliskovoi> is there an example of text-shadow?
2017-06-06T19:46:09 <lliskovoi> perhaps that can be used instead of an underline in the meantime?
2017-06-06T19:46:31 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-06-06T19:49:53 <Justin_o> danayo, lliskovoi: https://jsfiddle.net/tnx5b8q3/3/
2017-06-06T19:50:02 <Justin_o> text shadow for link in paragraph two
2017-06-06T19:50:03 * alanharnum has quit
2017-06-06T19:50:09 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-06-06T19:51:24 <lliskovoi> oh yikes Justin_o! looks pretty terrible, if anything it makes the text harder to see
2017-06-06T19:52:18 <danayo> ghosty!
2017-06-06T19:52:25 <danayo> spooky
2017-06-06T19:52:59 <danayo> maybe you can reduce the offset Justin_o ?
2017-06-06T19:53:27 <danayo> but actually, it could be somewhat confusing - having a shadow denote a link
2017-06-06T19:53:45 <danayo> not immediately apparent?
2017-06-06T19:54:35 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, that's true, but here's a bit of tweak anyways https://jsfiddle.net/tnx5b8q3/4/
2017-06-06T19:54:40 <Justin_o> i agree that it wouldn't be obvious though
2017-06-06T19:55:19 <Justin_o> danayo, lliskovoi: text-decoration settings for selections are in the spec, it's just that they aren't implemented in the browser yet, from what i can tell
2017-06-06T19:57:11 <danayo> yeah, too bad Justin_o
2017-06-06T19:57:16 <Justin_o> :(
2017-06-06T19:57:42 <Justin_o> it's interesting, too me the low contrast isn't as bad as colours that clash ( i think that's the right term )
2017-06-06T19:57:54 <Justin_o> so for me it's harder to read the link in the first paragraph than the bolded text
2017-06-06T19:58:30 <Justin_o> anyways, that's just a side note, i guess another option would be to highlight the link text in a slightly different colour
2017-06-06T19:58:57 <Justin_o> perhaps slightly brighter or darker.. again probably not super obvious that it's a link but could make it stand out
2017-06-06T19:59:10 <Justin_o> or we could make the link text colour a different colour when highlighted..
