2017-06-01T14:17:16 <jessm> Justin_o: website looks good in new OS version lol \xe2\x80\x94 thanks for encouraging me to come up to this year :)
2017-06-01T14:18:19 <Justin_o> jessm: :)
2017-06-01T14:18:23 <jessm> Justin_o: also, before I forget\xe2\x80\xa6 Tom Dekker and the comm. mtg. he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do\xe2\x80\xa6 do you have any ideas for a technology we can use? zoom? he mentioned it working for him
2017-06-01T14:19:25 <Justin_o> jessm: good question.. we should probably try to sync up with him before hand to see if he can get Vidyo working... i\'m not aware of how to bridge different video conferencing systems to work with our setup in the collaboration room
2017-06-01T14:20:24 <jessm> Justin_o: you raise a good point \xe2\x80\x94 we shoudl look into bridging \xe2\x80\x94 e.g. could Vidyo in the room connect to zoom

2017-06-01T14:20:30 <jessm> i\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Bert what he thinks
2017-06-01T14:21:21 <Justin_o> that makes sense
2017-06-01T14:32:25 <alanharnum> Sent an email to everyone about this, but will ask here as well - is http://adod.idrc.ocad.ca/ still an active project? got asked about it yesterday at Guelph.
2017-06-01T14:36:54 <michelled> alanharnum: lisa is the one to ask
2017-06-01T14:37:02 <michelled> I think she still works on it sometimes

2017-06-01T15:15:31 <danayo> hi alanharnum, do you have a few minutes? just wanted to check in quickly about some sjrk stuff
2017-06-01T15:17:07 <alanharnum> danayo: sure - right now before standup?
2017-06-01T15:17:12 <danayo> sure

2017-06-01T15:44:23 <danayo> sorry cindyli!
2017-06-01T15:45:16 <alanharnum> jhung: per your vidyo comment - I\'ve actually been told (in the past when I\'ve said I can project) that mics are important for various a11y reasons, including remote captioner use
2017-06-01T15:45:34 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-06-01T15:46:06 <alanharnum> it will also surprise no one to hear that i forgot at the start to turn on my microphone
2017-06-01T15:46:31 <alanharnum> then had trouble turning it off at the end so i could talk to people who came up to me without booming into the entire auditorium
2017-06-01T15:46:37 <alanharnum> Alan Vs. Microphones: The Saga Continues
2017-06-01T15:47:37 <cindyli> that\'s all right, danayo, i broke the "alphabetical order" rule in the first place ;)
