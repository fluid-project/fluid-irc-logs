2017-02-28T13:52:44 <Caren> thanks, alanharnum. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be out this morning at a talk (Ann Cavoukian), back at IDRC this aft. See you soon. :-)
2017-02-28T13:53:24 <alanharnum> Caren: great - I\'ll get started on changing the implementation to this new design and fill in the new assets when you can make them available to me
2017-02-28T13:55:18 <Caren> Let me try to get you the type sizes before I go alanharnum\xe2\x80\xa6if I can convert to em\xe2\x80\x99s quickly!

2017-02-28T20:51:34 <danayo> clown: do you need me to identify/suggest each privacy preference\'s default value?
2017-02-28T20:54:38 <danayo> Caren: I can meet anytime
2017-02-28T20:55:20 <clown> danayo, that would help, but only if there is a default.
2017-02-28T20:56:50 <clown> for example a list of trusted services won\'t have a default.
2017-02-28T20:57:17 <clown> or, the default will be the empty list (nothing is trusted).
2017-02-28T20:57:49 <danayo> clown: yes, that makes sense.
2017-02-28T20:57:51 <danayo> I suppose everything essentially has a default (like you say - an empty list).
2017-02-28T20:58:45 <danayo> But the "primary preferences" - if I can call them that - should all have specific default settings, I think
2017-02-28T20:59:09 <clown> and, in the spirit of today\'s talk \xe2\x80\x94 "privacy should be the default" \xe2\x80\x94 the default should be conservative in that it protects privacy.
2017-02-28T20:59:31 <danayo> yes
2017-02-28T20:59:32 <clown> yes, you are correct danayo \xe2\x80\x94 they should all have specific default settings.
2017-02-28T20:59:39 <Caren> alanharnum: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/f/22856
2017-02-28T21:00:18 <alanharnum> thanks Caren!
2017-02-28T21:00:24 <danayo> ok thanks clown
2017-02-28T21:00:45 <clown> good idea, danayo \xe2\x80\x94 thank you!
2017-02-28T21:00:54 <Caren> thank you, alanharnum! great css kerning ;-)
2017-02-28T21:02:02 <alanharnum> Caren: yes, that was an interesting technique to discover :)
2017-02-28T21:02:24 <Caren> danayo, wanna meet in my room in 6 mins?
2017-02-28T21:02:35 <danayo> 6 minutes sounds good Caren!
