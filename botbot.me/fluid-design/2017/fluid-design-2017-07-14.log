2017-07-14T18:22:28 <colinclark> wonderful, alanharnum
2017-07-14T18:22:38 <colinclark> I've got a funny caching situation where the site's CSS isn't all there
2017-07-14T18:22:41 <Jess_> took a quick look \xe2\x80\x94looks great
2017-07-14T18:22:45 <colinclark> but I'm sure reloading will do the trick
2017-07-14T18:23:00 <alanharnum> yeah, colinclark, i had same problem
2017-07-14T18:23:11 <alanharnum> a reload should fix - chrome has a thing about LOL I CACHE CSS forever
2017-07-14T18:23:14 <colinclark> yup, reloading worked
2017-07-14T18:23:16 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-07-14T18:23:19 <colinclark> great work
