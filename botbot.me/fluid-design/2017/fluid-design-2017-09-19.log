2017-09-19T13:47:19 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Design crit starts in 15 minutes. For those attending at 205 Richmond, we ask that the lights remain off in the Collab Room.
2017-09-19T13:49:56 <Caren_> hello all: I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a request for pictures of \xe2\x80\x9cinaccessible physical spaces especially if they include ramps and inaccessible doors or elevators\xe2\x80\x9d. Is that something we have access to or could direct someone to a good resource?

2017-09-19T13:54:10 <Jess_> Caren_: i do have pics
2017-09-19T13:54:26 <Jess_> Caren_: not sure if they fit what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for
2017-09-19T13:54:43 <Caren_> thanks jhung! Jess_ Pina has a presentation and she\xe2\x80\x99s looking for some images for her deck.
2017-09-19T13:55:13 <Jess_> Caren_: ok and she wants ramps and inaccessible doors in particular?
2017-09-19T13:56:08 <Jess_> I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if she can find good images with metadata on the creative commons search https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org
2017-09-19T13:56:51 <jhung> fluid-everyone: for those at 205 Richmond, let's meet at our desks for the design crit.
2017-09-19T13:57:10 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: I think Jess_ has used some images in this presentation showing inaccessible spaces: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/jy5IpvSRHpJKgLW
2017-09-19T13:58:39 <Caren_> thanks Jess_ and sepidehshahi, I will look at these and forward on!

2017-09-19T19:30:04 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I was trying to find the link to that Parade of Tools event - but can't seem to find it - (can't remember if it was in the channel or email) - do you have it?
2017-09-19T19:30:37 <sepidehshahi> it was in the channel danayo. let me find it and send it to you
2017-09-19T19:33:17 <sepidehshahi> danayo: here it is http://umwdtlt.com/virtual-tool-parade/
2017-09-19T19:33:41 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi!
2017-09-19T19:34:01 <sepidehshahi> thanks for reminding me of that I was planning on joining :)
2017-09-19T19:43:45 <danayo> yes, it sounds like it's worth checking out sepidehshahi
2017-09-19T20:01:09 <sepidehshahi> danayo: for touchnote prompts, are you thinking of having a set of predefined prompts, which include all the related questions, or do you think users should be able to customize those prompts?
2017-09-19T20:06:37 <danayo> I was thinking both sepidehshahi  :)
2017-09-19T20:06:56 <sepidehshahi> great!
2017-09-19T20:07:06 <danayo> I think custom prompts are really important, but it would be good to have some predefined
2017-09-19T20:11:55 <danayo> sepidehshahi: did you figure out how to live-stream that event?
2017-09-19T20:12:17 <sepidehshahi> you can just click on the youtube link danayo
2017-09-19T20:12:59 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m listening to this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhx54m3Ovpg&feature=youtu.be

2017-09-19T21:29:47 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss, found it! it was a different site that I got to through the SYA site https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/488/i-had-an-abortion?country=ca#p=10824
2017-09-19T21:30:31 <danayo> you can select a tag (which must come from a pre-populated list) which then becomes a filter for a new list of stories
2017-09-19T21:30:39 <danayo> and from there you can filter further
2017-09-19T21:31:51 <danayo> I'm not sure I like how they present the story in the left-hand panel like that (seems unnecessary to cram it in), but I thought the prompt questions and interactive answer tags were really interesting
2017-09-19T21:33:48 <danayo> ah yes, they provide checkboxes https://www.womenonweb.org/en/yourstory
2017-09-19T21:34:20 <danayo> (select Start)
2017-09-19T21:35:50 <danayo> prompting this way works well for a specific topic like this, but would be too prescriptive/structured for our purposes
2017-09-19T21:50:50 <gmoss> danayo: ah yes, sure enough it's checkboxes
2017-09-19T21:52:01 <gmoss> I agree that the way this site is organized may not lend itself very well to the SJRK storytelling tool, since we're expecting a range of stories about a range of topics, whereas that site expects stories about one focused topic about which they can anticipate a large deal of what might be said
