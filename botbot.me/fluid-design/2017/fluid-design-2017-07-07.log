2017-07-07T14:03:56 <Caren> michelled: Hi!
2017-07-07T14:04:06 <michelled> hi Caren
2017-07-07T14:04:11 <michelled> how\'s it going
2017-07-07T14:04:12 <michelled> ?
2017-07-07T14:04:20 <Caren> question re: idrc logo
2017-07-07T14:04:40 <Caren> should I use the OCADU with the IDRC logo in the box?
2017-07-07T14:04:51 <Caren> on the coop graphic
2017-07-07T14:04:56 <Caren> co-op
2017-07-07T14:05:20 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 good question. I would think it would just be the IDRC logo
2017-07-07T14:05:20 <Caren> or simply the IDRC logo that appears on the IDRC site
2017-07-07T14:05:50 <Caren> ok, great. It will look better, too :-)
2017-07-07T14:06:34 <michelled> :)

2017-07-07T14:23:08 <colinclark> Caren: wow, the "brochure" is looking really good
2017-07-07T14:26:04 <Caren> \xe2\x80\x9cthe piece\xe2\x80\x9d is ready to live somewhere\xe2\x80\xa6for now :-)
2017-07-07T14:27:20 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99m resurecting, briefly, brutalist design. I actually am digging the idea.
2017-07-07T14:27:27 <Caren> http://shuba.design/2/
2017-07-07T14:27:48 <Caren> brutalist web design that is
2017-07-07T14:51:35 <colinclark> :)
2017-07-07T14:55:55 <colinclark> I think it looks great, Caren
2017-07-07T14:56:09 <colinclark> there\'s something to be said for aestheticized simplicity
2017-07-07T14:57:27 <Caren> indeed, colinclark!
2017-07-07T14:58:26 <colinclark> I was biking past Robarts library yesterday, looking at the fa\xc3\xa7ades they are slowly erecting upon it
2017-07-07T14:58:35 <colinclark> smoother, much less interesting concrete
2017-07-07T14:58:53 <colinclark> and Robarts is a very strange building
2017-07-07T14:59:09 <colinclark> but it reminded me that the "brut" in brutalism is actually French :)
2017-07-07T14:59:35 <colinclark> "raw" or "unrefined"
2017-07-07T14:59:55 <colinclark> which is a bit different from the aggression that "brutalism" suggests in English
2017-07-07T15:01:16 <Caren> interesting. I must check it out
2017-07-07T15:03:14 <Caren> textures in architecture have interesting effects on the whole experience
2017-07-07T15:03:52 <colinclark> yes
2017-07-07T15:04:08 <colinclark> it\'s very minor\xe2\x80\x94just in a few spots where they\'ve added new entrances, etc.
2017-07-07T15:04:52 <colinclark> but the textural and colour inconsistency was visible, and made me wonder if it wasn\'t compromising a particular kind of "rawness" that the architect wanted throughout the building when it was built
2017-07-07T15:05:54 <colinclark> it\'s an awful building to inhabit, because of its geometrics
2017-07-07T15:06:46 <Caren> I suspect that being authentic to a brutalist aesthetic/experience is not easy because it goes against our general ideas of what is attractive
2017-07-07T15:07:11 <colinclark> whose ideas? :)
2017-07-07T15:07:20 <Caren> yes, and how we naturally move through a space
2017-07-07T15:10:03 <Caren> um, well\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess I am making statements based on a generalization of a norm in a north american context\xe2\x80\xa6

2017-07-07T15:13:57 <Caren> But my point is just that\xe2\x80\xa6it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting because it may not simply be a trend that comes and goes but rather have some value to change how we present content/interact with content/space. I was simply interested in the concept and practice in web/visual communication design. :-)
