2017-12-12T15:07:31 <lliskovoi> morning everyone! Does anyone know of examples of multi-level mobile drill down menus with good ARIA markup? I\'m looking for something along the lines of the iOS settings interaction, or other good examples.
2017-12-12T15:08:18 <lliskovoi> jhung, grrrero, ^ is this something you\'ve run into with SNOW?
2017-12-12T15:08:58 <grrrero> lliskovoi: Was just looking into multi-level menus in Wordpress but I\'m not sure about mobile!
2017-12-12T15:10:00 <lliskovoi> as long as it collapses into a drill down style menu, the considerations should be the same, so I\'d love to see what you\'ve found
2017-12-12T15:10:08 <lliskovoi> grrrero ^
2017-12-12T15:11:19 <lliskovoi> clown ^ do you know of any standard ARIA approaches for this?
2017-12-12T15:12:17 <clown> not offhand lliskovoi :-(
2017-12-12T15:12:33 <lliskovoi> thanks clown, will keep looking
2017-12-12T15:13:18 <clown> there was something last week about not using ARIA menu roles for things that looked and behavied as menus, but were essentially a list of navigational links.  Does that apply here?
2017-12-12T15:13:29 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-12-12T15:14:25 <lliskovoi> it\'s a mix of buttons that take you deeper into the menu structure and links to pages, which potentially makes it even more confusing
2017-12-12T15:14:25 <clown> lliskovoi ^
2017-12-12T15:15:34 <clown> the point of the article was that using nested lists of links is good enough for accessibilty, but representing them as menus was confusing.
2017-12-12T15:15:38 <grrrero> lliskovoi: I don\'t think we\'re using drill down menus just static multi-level menus? What do you think jhung?
2017-12-12T15:15:46 <clown> Buti, it sounds like your use case is even more complicated.
2017-12-12T15:16:08 <clown> It has buttons as well as menu-like objects?

2017-12-12T15:20:40 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-12-12T15:20:48 <lliskovoi> clown: looks like they changed a bunch of the markup since our conversation yesterday, now it\'s all lists of links
2017-12-12T15:21:06 * clown looks up that article
2017-12-12T15:21:32 * colinclark has quit
2017-12-12T15:23:36 <clown> here it is, lliskovoi:  http://adrianroselli.com/2017/10/dont-use-aria-menu-roles-for-site-nav.html
2017-12-12T15:25:03 <lliskovoi> thanks clown!
2017-12-12T15:30:03 <clown> you\'re weclome lliskovoi.  Note that the article references another page about "mega menus", which I haven\'t read, but might be relevant:  http://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/
2017-12-12T15:30:51 <lliskovoi> I\'ll follow the crumb trail
2017-12-12T15:35:57 <jhung> grrrero, lliskovoi - yes, the only multi-level navigation we\'re going to implement initially is for the sidebar. This way a visitor can move more easily between book chapters.
2017-12-12T15:40:30 <clown> jhung, does the side bar look like a table of contents?
2017-12-12T15:40:45 <clown> a tree view of the site?
2017-12-12T15:42:59 <jhung> clown: finding the mockup now...
2017-12-12T15:44:10 <jhung> clown: see this PDF, page 6. https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/SFH55EaHwBoUSss
2017-12-12T15:46:11 <clown> jhung:  I don\'t see a side bar.  I see a "top bar",  which makes me think of tabs (not menus).
2017-12-12T15:46:40 <clown> oops , should\'ve scrolled down\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-12-12T15:47:22 <jhung> :)
2017-12-12T15:48:05 <clown> hmmm..   I would like to see this in action.  Doesn\'t have to be now, just at some point.
2017-12-12T15:48:47 <grrrero> jhung clown: Wordpress has a built-in feature for that type of hierarchical menu
2017-12-12T15:49:07 <grrrero> Studying it now
