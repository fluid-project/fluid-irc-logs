2017-05-02T15:56:40 <alanharnum> it\'s a neat site - there are some photos of the "travelling exhibit" version, which is a fabric board with attached MP3 players

2017-05-02T17:38:12 <Caren> hi danayo. Would you have time to look at content we\xe2\x80\x99ve written for a Create-a-Thon  handout?
2017-05-02T17:44:13 * alanharnum joined the channel

2017-05-02T17:54:48 <Caren> danayo:  sent you an email :-)
2017-05-02T17:58:02 <danayo> Caren: audience is quite broad, is that right? youngsters and adults etc?
2017-05-02T17:59:13 <Caren> high school students to young-senior

2017-05-02T18:21:41 <danayo> Caren: and purpose is to describe the experience so participants know what to expect? it\'s not to recruit, right?
2017-05-02T18:23:15 <Caren> danayo: no, not for recruit. I will be verbally talking about the event, the written content is for summary and will have a schedule of the day attached
2017-05-02T18:27:33 <danayo> ok Caren. It sounds good. I might add something more to encourage folks to feel comfortable to contribute based on their experiences - maybe the language of "collect individual perspectives" could be changed or augmented to include something like - any ideas or feedback that you think are relevant are welcome ... there are no bad ideas ... something like that
2017-05-02T18:28:08 <danayo> the tone is quite formal right now
2017-05-02T18:36:24 <Caren> Ok, I hear what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. I will consider bringing some of the less formal tone I use in my verbal intro into the written content. thanks for the great feedback, danayo
