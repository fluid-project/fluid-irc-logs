2017-02-13T19:54:55 <Justin_o> jhung: what do you think of this toggle styles https://jsfiddle.net/cu09c3st/
2017-02-13T19:55:11 <Justin_o> no animation though
2017-02-13T19:55:18 <Justin_o> and still need to figure out the focus styling
2017-02-13T20:00:55 <jhung> Justin_o: looks good. If you increase the font size and toggle the switch, the container shifts / expands a bit.
2017-02-13T20:01:50 <jhung> Justin_o: as for focus styling - I really can\'t make a recommendation without seeing it in context of other focus states.
2017-02-13T20:03:23 <Justin_o> jhung: no problem about focus... i think we\'ll just outline the whole thing
2017-02-13T20:03:49 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks for spotting the size changes.. here\'s an update, but still need to figure out the width changing https://jsfiddle.net/cu09c3st/1/
2017-02-13T20:04:21 <jhung> I was wondering if the animation is really necessary Justin_o. It may give the false impression that you can slide the widget\xe2\x80\xa6 which I assume doesn\'t do anything.
2017-02-13T20:04:37 <Justin_o> correct, you can\'t slide the widget
2017-02-13T20:05:45 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah, in that case I don\'t know if the animation is really necessary. I\'m open to other opinions though.
2017-02-13T20:06:37 <Justin_o> it\'d make things easier.. i just noticed that stan\'s had an animation
2017-02-13T20:06:47 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure dana actually considered that in her designs
2017-02-13T20:07:59 <jhung> Justin_o: we can ask danayo tomorrow to see what she thinks.
2017-02-13T20:10:45 <Justin_o> jhung: makes sense
2017-02-13T20:11:01 * michelled has quit
2017-02-13T20:11:20 <Justin_o> jhung: i think i got the width constant https://jsfiddle.net/cu09c3st/2/
2017-02-13T20:11:39 <Justin_o> jhung: i just adjust the padding a bit when the "off" is selected
2017-02-13T20:14:23 <jhung> Justin_o: another thing\xe2\x80\xa6 I think the width and position of "On" and "Off" should be the same in either state.
2017-02-13T20:15:19 <Justin_o> jhung: ah intersting, okay
2017-02-13T20:15:32 <Justin_o> that would also have helped with the width of the whole thing
