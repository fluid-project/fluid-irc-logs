2017-03-13T13:20:22 <gtirloni> jhung: hi! good morning. do you still see warnings for emails sent to everyone? e.g. lisa's today
2017-03-13T13:23:56 <jhung> gtirloni:  yes. There's a spoofing warning on Lisa's email.
2017-03-13T13:25:43 <jhung> gtirloni: does your email from Lisa have a warning?
2017-03-13T13:25:57 <gtirloni> no, but i've seen warnings for other people's emails :(
2017-03-13T13:26:13 <gtirloni> IT Services seems to still be working on that, we set up a test list for them
2017-03-13T13:26:31 <jhung> ok great. This is so strange.
2017-03-13T13:30:41 <alanharnum> it's the lack of a discernable pattern that gets me
