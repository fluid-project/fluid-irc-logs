2017-10-05T15:05:29 <jhung> Caren_: do you know which sessions are happening in which rooms? I am making signs.
2017-10-05T15:07:13 <Caren_> jhung: sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but Jess_ may know
2017-10-05T15:10:12 <jhung> Caren_: I doesn't matter. I'll make modular signs where components of the sign can be swapped in and out (like different room numbers, session titles etc.).
2017-10-05T15:10:43 <sepidehshahi> Hi simonjb: I had a quick look at our wiki pages for UX evaluation. they are pretty resourcefull and include the main sources. Google accessibility guidelines are also very practical: https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html
2017-10-05T15:11:00 <simonjb> thanks sepidehshahi
2017-10-05T15:14:04 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I was going to send out an email cancelling next week's design crit because of the various events happening. Is this okay with everyone?
2017-10-05T15:14:55 <sepidehshahi> I agree jhung.
2017-10-05T15:15:01 <danayo> that's ok with me jhung. we talked about possibly continuing the MyL3 discussion, but I think it would be fine to do it the following week

2017-10-05T15:43:30 <danayo> grrrero: if you want to chat about the SJRK site at any point at all just let me know
2017-10-05T15:43:30 <jhung> No problem. I'll just print appropriate labelling which can be swapped
2017-10-05T15:49:11 <Jess_> jhung: very sensible :) thanks!
2017-10-05T15:52:23 <grrrero> danayo: Oh I didn't see the message here oops! Let's screen share this afternoon maybe?
