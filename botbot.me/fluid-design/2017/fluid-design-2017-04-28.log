2017-04-28T16:20:25 <alanharnum> Justin_O danayo: per conversation yesterday, I got rid of the logo backgrounds: https://rawgit.com/waharnum/floeproject.org/FLOE-506/index.html - also implemented danayo\'s other feedback
2017-04-28T16:20:33 <alanharnum> I think the backgroundless logos work fine
2017-04-28T16:20:37 <alanharnum> & look better
2017-04-28T16:20:56 <alanharnum> contrast doesn\'t seem to be an issue with the Hewlett H, which is the only thing I was worried about
2017-04-28T16:24:33 <danayo> thanks alanharnum. I think the logos definitely look better without the background boxes. a quick check of that green on the dark background colour shows that it passes WCAG AA for larget text, but fails otherwise. I think it could be considered large text, and since it\'s a logo, probably ok?
2017-04-28T16:25:27 <danayo> alanharnum: is there any way we could left-justify the IDRC logo so it lines up with the test, the same way the Hewlett logo lines up?
2017-04-28T16:25:32 <danayo> *text
2017-04-28T16:25:47 <alanharnum> danayo: I think it\'s fine - the "H" is a decorative / wordmark, IMO, along with being larger text
2017-04-28T16:26:06 <danayo> and so that the two logos are aligned in the desktop view
2017-04-28T16:28:45 <alanharnum> danayo: yup, let me play with the viewBox a little to "pan" around the IDRC logo so it lines up better with the Hewlett
2017-04-28T16:30:03 <danayo> thx
2017-04-28T16:34:10 <alanharnum> danayo: done, looks a lot better
2017-04-28T16:35:42 <danayo> much better, thanks alanharnum!

2017-04-28T17:41:10 <colinclark> jhung: Your budget for the create-a-thon seems totally sensible
2017-04-28T17:41:20 <colinclark> you might want to call it a "proposed budget"
2017-04-28T17:41:31 <colinclark> just so it\'s clear we\'re flexible in its specifics :)
2017-04-28T17:41:37 <jhung> colinclark:  right. :)
2017-04-28T17:42:03 <jhung> just wanted to check in w Caren for any other incidentals before submitting to Iris.
2017-04-28T17:42:35 <colinclark> makes sense

2017-04-28T18:04:07 <Caren> jhung: hi. Have supplies been checked: (chart paper, working markers). I\xe2\x80\x99m at the IDRC now and can have a look, if need be.
2017-04-28T18:06:34 <jhung> Caren: awesome. We\'ll need pens, post-its, and other things. I assume we have all of this.
2017-04-28T18:16:37 <jhung> Caren, fyi I am reformatting the Co-design page on the wiki. It\'s going to be a bit messy in the meantime.
2017-04-28T18:21:15 <colinclark> Hey Caren, what did Miles and Calum end up thinking of the video they helped make?

2017-04-28T18:24:35 <danayo> as always feel free to add / edit

2017-04-28T18:25:25 <colinclark> danayo: these are great notes, thanks for taking the time to write them up
2017-04-28T18:25:41 <danayo> no problem!

2017-04-28T18:28:34 <cindyli> danayo, jhung, any recommendations on an easy to learn software to draw some simple UXs that have tables, radio buttons with labels, regular buttons, etc. i found drawing on paper is quite time consuming. whenever changing something needs to start over again
2017-04-28T18:29:47 <jhung> cindyli: you can try balsamiq mockups, google drawings, OmniGraffle.
2017-04-28T18:29:55 <Caren> colinclark: I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to share it with them tonight. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been busy every evening this week! Better social life than me\xe2\x80\xa6haha.
2017-04-28T18:30:04 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-04-28T18:30:06 <colinclark> that\'s cool
2017-04-28T18:30:09 <colinclark> I hope they like it
2017-04-28T18:30:25 <colinclark> I was telling Jutta just now about how I\'ll edit up a version that has more of the reflection and less of the tech stuff
2017-04-28T18:30:38 <colinclark> Calum\'s "what I learned" reflection was REALLY fascinating
2017-04-28T18:31:33 <Caren> I will for sure let you know how they react. I did let Miles know about the camera work\xe2\x80\xa6he had a big smile.
2017-04-28T18:31:55 <cindyli> jhung: omniGraffle can draw buttons and tables?! ok. seems i have a lot to learn ;)
2017-04-28T18:32:53 <jhung> cindyli: buttons it can do\xe2\x80\xa6 not sure how well it does tables. It\'s been a while since I\'ve used it.
2017-04-28T18:33:38 <Caren> Ok, thanks for letting me know jhung.
2017-04-28T18:33:46 <cindyli> jhung: ah ok, going to try google drawings
2017-04-28T18:34:11 <danayo> jhung cindyli: i think if you\'re looking to grab specific UX features (like buttons etc), Balsamiq is best. I think with Omnigraffle and Google draw you can create general shapes etc
2017-04-28T18:34:29 <danayo> but I only tried Balsamiq once very briefly
2017-04-28T18:34:51 <danayo> and haven\'t used Omnigraffle in a while!
2017-04-28T18:35:03 <cindyli> ok, i will give a try to Balsamiq
2017-04-28T18:49:20 <jhung> Caren: got a minute to chat?
2017-04-28T18:51:14 <Caren> sure.
2017-04-28T18:52:11 <Caren> I\xe2\x80\x99ve joined your room :-)

2017-04-28T20:25:18 <danayo> colinclark, alanharnum, michelled  I love this image from Arnstein\'s article https://lithgow-schmidt.dk/sherry-arnstein/resources/je-participe.gif
2017-04-28T20:28:53 <colinclark> wow, this is fascinating
2017-04-28T20:29:12 <colinclark> so is it a critique of the co-optation of "participation?"
2017-04-28T20:29:19 <colinclark> or am I misunderstanding?
2017-04-28T20:30:15 <danayo> that it is, colinclark, as I understand it
2017-04-28T20:30:20 <colinclark> :)
2017-04-28T20:30:25 <colinclark> pretty great
2017-04-28T20:30:39 <danayo> from here https://lithgow-schmidt.dk/sherry-arnstein/ladder-of-citizen-participation.html
2017-04-28T20:31:38 <alanharnum> it\'s from the May 68 events in France, according to the page
2017-04-28T20:32:03 <alanharnum> " The poster highlights the fundamental point that participation without redistribution of power is an empty and frustrating process for the powerless. It allows the powerholders to claim that all sides were considered, but makes it possible for only some of those sides to benefit."
