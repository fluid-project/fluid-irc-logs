2017-10-24T15:08:04 <simonjb> grrrero: here\'s an example of where microsoft uses the description toggle that I was thinking of: https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2017/07/groove-videos.jpg?itok=9nCmOjv7
2017-10-24T15:08:14 <simonjb> and: https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2017/07/groove-artist-video.jpg?itok=e8TerGOW
2017-10-24T15:08:30 <simonjb> in the first image, we see the icons on the left
2017-10-24T15:08:34 <grrrero> Awesome thanks simonjb!
2017-10-24T15:09:03 <simonjb> and when you click on the "hamburger" the descriptions slide out and move the content to the right
2017-10-24T15:09:27 <grrrero> Interesting!
2017-10-24T15:09:28 <simonjb> the descriptions then persist until you toggle them off again

2017-10-24T17:02:08 <jhung> lliskovoi: on the big idea site, we will need to put a login for businesses. Where do you think we should put that link?
2017-10-24T17:02:56 <lliskovoi> jhung: probably in the main business section, but let me think about it
2017-10-24T17:03:20 <lliskovoi> Do you need additional mockups?
2017-10-24T17:03:49 <lliskovoi> I should have some time to work on it at the end of the week
2017-10-24T17:13:02 <jhung> lliskovoi: yeah, if you can do a mock-up that\'d be great.
2017-10-24T17:14:02 <lliskovoi> jhung: great, can we have a quick chat to discuss the pages and functionality? I have time late this afternoon or tomorrow (preferable).
2017-10-24T17:15:15 <jhung> We can do tomorrow morning lliskovoi.
2017-10-24T17:15:29 <lliskovoi> perfect, how does 10:30 sound?
2017-10-24T17:16:05 <jhung> That works for me!
2017-10-24T17:17:04 <lliskovoi> see you tomorrow!
2017-10-24T17:18:09 <jhung> Caren_: FYI I made some feedback on the CaT doc on the wiki.
2017-10-24T17:18:34 <jhung> I made some comments inline, and put a comment at the bottom
2017-10-24T17:30:49 <Caren_> thanks, jhung. I saw it come through on email. It got me thinking how important even the documentation of the iterations of the entry are given that my perspective may be somewhat unintentional corporate tilt. I\xe2\x80\x99m also intrested in what colinclark was mentioning in the 11a.m. today re: co-design tools, etc. which makes me think the CaT entry may need to be pulled apart and recast as something different given the
2017-10-24T17:30:50 <Caren_> direction the entries around co-design take.
2017-10-24T17:31:51 <Caren_> *may have a somewhat unitntentional corporate tilt.
2017-10-24T17:34:43 <jhung> Caren_: I think having a guide entry on Create-a-thons would still be valuable. It should give a general overview what the activity is and why it\'s important to the inclusive design process. We can then provide specific tools / activities / ice breakers etc under a "How" section? Structured similarly to this Guide entry? https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/ToddlerGrandparentConversation.html
2017-10-24T17:39:43 <Caren_> sounds good, jhung
