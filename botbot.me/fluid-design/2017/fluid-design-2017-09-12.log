2017-09-12T15:51:40 <danayo> sepidehshahi: yes, how about we meet in 10 minutes? I just need to eat something first :)
2017-09-12T15:52:04 <sepidehshahi> for sure. Please take your time danayo :)

2017-09-12T16:08:53 <danayo> I'll unlock my room
2017-09-12T16:10:59 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo
2017-09-12T16:50:42 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just watched an overview of a bullet journal\xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s too complicated! I\xe2\x80\x99d be confused and lost among pages :D
2017-09-12T16:52:06 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-12T16:52:33 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I agree it does seem overwhelming/confusing at first - they also go over it very quickly! I can imagine it would take some time to develop a personalized system
2017-09-12T16:52:37 <danayo> I think lliskovoi uses it so it would be interesting to ask her what her initial experience was like
2017-09-12T16:55:04 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s true
