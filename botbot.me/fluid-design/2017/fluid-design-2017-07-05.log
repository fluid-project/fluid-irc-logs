2017-07-05T13:51:26 <jhung> hi colinclark. Are you free this morning to chat about PhET?
2017-07-05T13:52:56 <colinclark> oh yes, we hadn\'t actually settled on a time on in that thread
2017-07-05T13:53:01 <colinclark> Can we do 10 am tomorrow morning?
2017-07-05T13:53:17 <colinclark> Today I\'m pretty swamped preparing this new proposal
2017-07-05T13:54:12 <jhung> 10am tomorrow morning works for me colinclark. Justin_o, michelled, Caren does that time work?
2017-07-05T13:54:41 <Justin_o> jhung, colinclark: that should work for me
2017-07-05T13:54:43 <michelled> yes, it works for me
2017-07-05T13:55:19 <Caren> yes, tomorrow at 10am is good for me
2017-07-05T13:55:35 <jhung> Done. 10am tomorrow. I\'ll put it on the calendar.
2017-07-05T13:56:34 <Justin_o> jhung: thans

2017-07-05T15:11:33 <Caren> Hello all! \x0fI\xe2\x80\x99m working on an infographic that initially was going to be used as a controled presentation but is now going to be an embeded web graphic that can be \x0ffreely shared and embeded on other sites. Given the wide and unknown distribution it should be fully accessible. Does anyone have any past experience retrofitting an illustrator file to be screen reader friendly? It will need some alt text as well.
2017-07-05T15:36:53 <Caren> apologies, I missed standup. My update is\xe2\x80\xa6.I continue to work on the Infographic for Cooperative Platforms
2017-07-05T15:43:40 <Justin_o> danayo: the adjusters i\'m adding for UIO+ are for dictionary, highlight selection colour, syllabification, character spacing
2017-07-05T15:47:59 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2017-07-05T15:51:52 <danayo> Justin_o: could you describe syllabification?
2017-07-05T15:54:59 <danayo> Caren: I think if it were a simpler image I\xe2\x80\x99d say create an svg \xe2\x80\xa6 but for a more complex infographic I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure (other than alt-text). jhung, any ideas about Caren\xe2\x80\x99s question above?
2017-07-05T15:56:49 <danayo> Caren: I guess you mean, other than building it with html/css, right?
2017-07-05T16:00:00 <Caren> danayo: yes, a PNG is the example used and is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen most often.
2017-07-05T16:00:06 <Caren> like this: <a href="https://onlinemba.marshall.usc.edu/news/the-female-entrepreneur-women-who-run-their-world/" target="_blank" title="The Online MBA at USC"><img title="The Female Entrepreneur: Women who run their world" src="https://onlinemba.marshall.usc.edu/wp-content/themes/uscmarshall/images/usc-mba-female-entrepreneurship.png" border="0" alt="The Female Entrepreneur: Women who run their world" /></a>
2017-07-05T16:00:52 <Caren> that should be all one url that then is used on a site or blog.
2017-07-05T16:01:07 <Caren> It is from here: https://onlinemba.marshall.usc.edu/news/the-female-entrepreneur-women-who-run-their-world/
2017-07-05T16:02:33 <Justin_o> danayo: syllabification is the breaking up of words to show their syllables.. e.g. syl\xc2\xb7la\xc2\xb7ble
2017-07-05T16:04:23 <danayo> thanks Justin_o. so it\xe2\x80\x99s just a visual preference, right? no audio component?
2017-07-05T16:20:16 <colinclark> jhung: Do you have some time this afternoon to talk with me about ePub and OER authoring environments for the grant proposal we\'re working on?
2017-07-05T16:43:45 <Justin_o> danayo: i believe that\'s correct
2017-07-05T17:01:27 <jhung> colinclark: sure. When do you want to meet?
2017-07-05T17:01:39 <colinclark> how about in 15 minutes, jhung?
2017-07-05T17:01:49 <jhung> Ok. Sounds good colinclark
2017-07-05T17:02:03 <colinclark> awesome!

2017-07-05T19:48:44 <Caren> jhung: would you have time to chat with me about techinical how-to for a complex infographic I\xe2\x80\x99ve been designing. The intention is for it to live on a web site as a graphic and to be a sharable graphic via a link (usually it\xe2\x80\x99s a PNG) that can be embeded on other sites/blogs. Because it is now going to be widely available it needs to be accessible. I\xe2\x80\x99m going through a checklist of design needs: screen-readable
2017-07-05T19:48:44 <Caren> (including some alt text), high contrast (black and white version)\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-07-05T19:49:56 <jhung> Sure Caren. Give me 5 minutes?
2017-07-05T19:50:22 <Caren> awesome. I\xe2\x80\x99ll open my room, jhung. thanks
