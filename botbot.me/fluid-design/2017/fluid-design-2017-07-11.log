2017-07-11T21:07:21 <danayo> for mobile was thinking something like this alanharn_ alanharnum https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/M6zvkbeU6zie5n9
2017-07-11T21:11:16 <alanharn_> danayo: I like that
2017-07-11T21:11:22 <danayo> great
2017-07-11T21:25:44 <danayo> alanharn_: and this is what i was thinking for the \xe2\x80\x9csee the wiki page\xe2\x80\x9d link \xe2\x80\x94> de-emphasized. I added it to the bottom of the text, and am thinking it would appear on the About page only https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/index.php/s/XuSXZPMDFTq5ZPM
2017-07-11T21:26:18 <alanharn_> danayo: that looks good to me
2017-07-11T21:26:20 <danayo> and maybe it should just say \xe2\x80\x9cvisit the wiki page for more information\xe2\x80\x9d
2017-07-11T21:26:39 <danayo> because \xe2\x80\x9cproject updates\xe2\x80\x9d will be covered by recent activity
2017-07-11T21:27:12 <danayo> alanharn_ ^
2017-07-11T21:35:38 <alanharn_> danayo: seems reasonable
