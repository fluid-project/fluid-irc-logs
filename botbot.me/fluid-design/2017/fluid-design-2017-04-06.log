2017-04-06T16:27:41 <Justin_o> Did anyone see Reddit's Place experiment. I hadn't heard about it till just now. https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/in-memoriam-reddits-72-hour-live-graffiti-wall-as-a-social-experiment/
2017-04-06T16:28:32 <Justin_o> it seems pretty interesting from the collaboration aspect, not sure about it's ability to end hate speech.
