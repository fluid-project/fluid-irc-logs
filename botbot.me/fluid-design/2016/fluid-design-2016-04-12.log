2016-04-12T15:55:23 <Justin_o> danayo: my limited experience with resourcespace left me with similar impressions to yours. The interface seems unfriendly. Perhaps I just don\'t know how to use it, but things didn\'t seem to work as I\'d expect.
2016-04-12T15:57:12 <jhung> danayo I just sent an email to the fluid-work list about the issues re: design artifacts in dropbox. Feel free to chime in.
2016-04-12T15:57:19 <danayo> Justin_o: unfriendly / confusing UI, but also I think the way it\'s structured is odd. or maybe it really is just because of the UI
2016-04-12T15:57:21 <danayo> not sure
2016-04-12T15:57:27 <danayo> thanks jhung!
2016-04-12T15:58:07 <Justin_o> danayo: yah, not sure.. i also haven\'t really used a dams before, so not sure if the structure is typical or not
2016-04-12T16:00:18 * colinclark has quit
2016-04-12T16:00:47 <danayo> for example Justin_o: from the main page, I can create a new collection, but it won\'t appear there. it will appear in My Collections. I think only the adiminstrator can create a project on the main page maybe? but it was totally unclear. and when I go to My Collections, the main page Project that you created is shown there. So it\'s like the hierarchy is mixed. No way to get a sense of it :\\
2016-04-12T16:01:43 <Justin_o> yah, that is confusing
2016-04-12T16:02:01 <Justin_o> danayo: i think there was a way to promote something to the front, but maybe it has to be done by an admin
2016-04-12T16:02:08 <Justin_o> they also have two levels of admin which is also confusing
2016-04-12T16:08:41 <danayo> ah, ok Justin_o

2016-04-12T18:00:10 <danayo> jhung: what is CDN?
2016-04-12T18:00:35 <danayo> re: your repository email
2016-04-12T18:01:25 <jhung> Sorry I should have defined that danayo. CDN = "Content Distribution Network". Basically a server that stores and serves static content.
2016-04-12T18:01:43 <jhung> So if the content isn\'t changing much, we can put it there.
2016-04-12T18:02:12 <danayo> and that\'s something we\'d have to set up jhung?
2016-04-12T18:02:42 <jhung> danayo: we already have it set up and using it for other projects.
2016-04-12T18:04:51 <danayo> ok jhung.
2016-04-12T18:08:09 <danayo> jhung: would anyone be able to access the files there? or just someone with admin priveleges?
2016-04-12T18:12:50 <jhung> danayo: I think anyone with the link will be able to access the content. But there may be more levels of permissions. I haven\'t used it too much. Maybe Justin_o / gtirloni can add to this?
2016-04-12T18:13:24 <gtirloni> anyone is able to access it with the link
2016-04-12T18:13:39 <gtirloni> to download, that is
2016-04-12T18:14:01 <gtirloni> for uploading, there is a special user and a SSH key that is needed to access the area
2016-04-12T18:14:18 <Justin_o> danayo: ^ what gtirloni said
2016-04-12T18:15:00 <Justin_o> gtirloni: are there any space restrictions on the CDN?
2016-04-12T18:15:18 <gtirloni> not that i\'m aware of
2016-04-12T18:16:02 <sepidehshahi> danayo: can you connect to fluid standup pls
2016-04-12T18:16:02 <danayo> thanks gtirloni, Justin_o, jhung
