2016-04-22T14:22:22 <Jess__> sepidehshahi: those flowers and petals looks amazing IMHO
2016-04-22T14:22:44 <Jess__> JT said she was going to get in touch with you if she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already
2016-04-22T14:23:47 <sepidehshahi> Jess__: as colinclark mentioned they look more like pizza slices:) you can customize your pizza and choose your toppings!
2016-04-22T14:24:05 <sepidehshahi> she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got back to me yet
2016-04-22T14:24:09 <colinclark> they are really great
2016-04-22T14:24:23 <colinclark> I can imagine that is actually emerging as an adjunct tool to US&C
2016-04-22T14:24:38 <colinclark> since I\'m increasingly seeing that the intention and role is somewhat different
2016-04-22T14:24:43 <colinclark> but it\'s very interesting
2016-04-22T14:26:08 <sepidehshahi> I think they provide an opportunity to break out of what we had mapped out in the initial US&C and include way many different states and contexts. They could even be generated on the fly, depending on the product/activity or user group
2016-04-22T14:28:32 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2016-04-22T14:29:16 <colinclark> And I think the real heart of US&C is the "way many" part in terms of identifying needs
2016-04-22T14:30:18 <colinclark> I think one of the most important parts of US&C today, which is really unique, is the way in which it lets you see personas as dynamic individuals, rather than static
2016-04-22T14:30:45 <colinclark> so the ability to layer multiple "constellations" for one person, in order to trace how their needs change over time
2016-04-22T14:30:51 <colinclark> or in different situations
2016-04-22T14:31:06 <colinclark> then also the ability to do that with multiple individuals
2016-04-22T14:31:28 <colinclark> for example, to better highlight unique outliers or important clusters of needs

2016-04-22T16:08:16 <sepidehshahi> michelled: are you looking for Floe post cards?
2016-04-22T16:09:05 <sepidehshahi> I have created a few new ones for Jutta but they were not in a post card format and were more presentations or proposals, michelled
2016-04-22T16:10:52 <michelled> sepidehshahi: yes, or one pagers or something to send to a booth that OCAD is having
2016-04-22T16:10:58 <michelled> it\'s not until May
2016-04-22T16:12:27 <sepidehshahi> ok, let me send you a couple of things that I have recently created for Floe. Then we can talk to JT to see if she wants anything else to be displayed on the OCAD booth, michelled
2016-04-22T16:15:35 <michelled> thanks sepidehshahi
2016-04-22T16:16:50 <sepidehshahi> np michelled, just give me some time to quickly put them in a postcard format (add headerss, etc.) and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll send them out.
2016-04-22T16:17:09 <michelled> no rush :)
