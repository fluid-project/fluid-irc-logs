2016-01-05T16:55:29 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: I'm so excited to hear that you know Elizabeth Sanders' work
2016-01-05T16:55:53 <colinclark> I've been reading everything I can by her, and have her Convivial Tools book on its way
2016-01-05T16:56:48 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: she is amazing, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read her book though, her methods are unique and she is almost the mother of design research
2016-01-05T16:57:56 <sepidehshahi> I should refresh my knowldge of make tools, and I would be really happy to help you with the community meeting about Co-Design
2016-01-05T16:59:56 <colinclark> let's do it--it'll be fun
2016-01-05T17:00:11 <colinclark> I'm in the very early idea stages of planning a workshop on the topic of Software Creativity
2016-01-05T17:00:23 <colinclark> bringing together designers, computer scientists and artists to the IDRC
2016-01-05T17:00:36 <colinclark> I think it would be great to invite her to it
2016-01-05T17:00:55 <sepidehshahi> Absolutely!
2016-01-05T17:02:39 <sepidehshahi> her methods are very much focused on built objects and products and sometimes interactions. So it would be really intersting to see how they could be applied for designing interfaces, software, and digital stuff
