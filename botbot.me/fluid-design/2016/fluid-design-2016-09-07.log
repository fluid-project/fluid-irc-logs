2016-09-07T15:06:40 <jhung> danayo: I issued a pull request to your branch yesterday which fixes the SVG issues you were having.
2016-09-07T15:12:48 <danayo> yes, great, thanks jhung. i just merged it. and i should now do a "git fetch origin" to make any further changes (not upstream), right? when you have a few minutes could you explain some of the changes you made to me?
2016-09-07T15:13:30 <jhung> yes. fetch origin and then merge origin/master
2016-09-07T15:13:41 <jhung> Sure we can talk now before standup.

2016-09-07T15:28:55 <danayo> argh, sorry jhung, missed this, maybe after standup?
2016-09-07T15:29:13 <jhung> no prob. Sure after standup is fine.
2016-09-07T15:29:23 <danayo> thanks

2016-09-07T15:53:06 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: did you see the e-mail i forwarded you about Sam who is interested in volunteering. I sent it about a week or two ago i think when you were both probably away.

2016-09-07T16:21:56 <danayo> Justin_o: I did see it. You asked him to let us know some dates that would work for him to meet with us. As far as I know we haven\'t heard back from him, right?
2016-09-07T16:24:01 <Justin_o> danayo: ah, i had thought he replied all on his e-mail, but it looks like it was just sent to me. I\'ve forwarded to all of you.
