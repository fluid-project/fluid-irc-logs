2016-01-14T15:40:26 <danayo> cindyli Justin_o: I added our notes from yesterday\'s UIO meeting to the iteration page
2016-01-14T15:40:43 <danayo> I didn\'t get to any of the changes yesterday but am working on them today
2016-01-14T15:41:04 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-14T15:41:09 <cindyli> thanks, danayo, wonder if you could add the styling for tooltips as well?
2016-01-14T15:41:30 <danayo> yes cindyli
2016-01-14T15:41:36 <cindyli> thanks, danayo

2016-01-14T15:47:49 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-01-14T15:55:54 <jhung> @danayo do we have a black & white version of user states and contexts diagram? I was thinking of using it as a handout and have people fill it in and compare with each other.
2016-01-14T15:58:06 <danayo> jhung: I think everything we have is here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zc4s34xwhcl2cku/AAAJo5S0i3VnJe6iH6b7n-FEa?dl=0
2016-01-14T15:58:18 <danayo> I don\'t see a B&W version in there, but could dig deeper
2016-01-14T15:58:30 <danayo> the blue and white could be modified pretty easily tho
2016-01-14T15:59:02 <jhung> yeah, I\'ll do that danayo and add it.
2016-01-14T16:09:08 <danayo> btw that sounds like a great exercise jhung
2016-01-14T16:12:17 <danayo> jhung: I think the blue and white version is an earlier draft - from a quick comparison with the yellow/green it looks very similar, but some of the detailed wording has been chanaged
2016-01-14T16:12:27 <jhung> danayo: yeah. I was even thinking it\'ll be a fun exercise to do with well known people. Like filling one out for Barack Obama, or for Lady Gaga. :)
2016-01-14T16:13:03 <jhung> We wouldn\'t put those results online of course\xe2\x80\xa6 just something to do as an exercise during a presentation.
2016-01-14T16:14:43 <jhung> I\'ll take a look at the different versions and go with the one that makes the most sense. If I;m not mistaken there were two versions? One specific to Floe and one general?
2016-01-14T16:14:47 <jhung> ^ danayo
2016-01-14T16:15:11 <danayo> oh actually I didn\'t know that jhung
2016-01-14T16:15:32 <danayo> or I forgot :)
2016-01-14T16:16:52 <danayo> I know sepidehshahi had done some work on it for P4A https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+States+and+Contexts
2016-01-14T16:17:09 <jhung> Yeah. I think that\'s where I got my impression danayo.
2016-01-14T16:21:20 <sepidehshahi> Great danayo! thank you so much. I\xe2\x80\x99ll include that in the report this afternoon

2016-01-14T16:51:19 <danayo> everyone: here is the accessibility tool that I mentioned - the main site: http://www.facil-iti.com/ and the tool itself: https://ws.facil-iti.com/
2016-01-14T16:51:50 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-14T16:52:12 <danayo> once you create a "profile" it is stored locally and your preferences are applied to the website as well as the tool
2016-01-14T16:53:06 <colinclark> jhung: Your idea of having people do US&C diagrams and comparing them is really great
2016-01-14T16:53:23 <colinclark> to me, the real value of US&C is how it allows you to see needs and preferences "relationally"
2016-01-14T16:53:39 <colinclark> either, in terms of how a particular need is shared amongst a variety of potential users of the system
2016-01-14T16:53:58 <colinclark> or just as equally, to highlight really unique needs
2016-01-14T16:54:06 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-01-14T16:54:14 <colinclark> those points in a US&C diagram when they\'ve been overlaid that stand alone
2016-01-14T16:55:09 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-14T16:55:37 <jhung> That\'s exactly the point I\'m hoping to reinforce colinclark. The diagram does a great job at presenting it visually, moreso when you start comparing two diagrams\xe2\x80\xa6.
2016-01-14T16:56:03 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2016-01-14T16:56:14 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: Here\xe2\x80\x99s that BeeLine Reader I mentioned in stand-up today: http://www.beelinereader.com/
2016-01-14T16:58:00 <Justin_o> it\'s more subtle than i was expecting. You almost don\'t notice it.
2016-01-14T16:59:57 <anastasiac> yes, and you can choose even more subtle colours, like the blues, or greys
2016-01-14T17:00:27 <danayo> that\'s really interesting anastasiac
2016-01-14T17:00:49 <colinclark> pretty fascinating
2016-01-14T17:00:56 <danayo> I like the dark setting
2016-01-14T17:01:03 <Justin_o> i liked the greys
2016-01-14T17:01:14 <anastasiac> I like the blues

2016-01-14T17:57:50 <danayo> want to be sure to note that they are a work-in-progress
2016-01-14T17:58:28 <sepidehshahi> awesome! for sure.

2016-01-14T19:33:04 <danayo> cindyli Justin_o updated mockups for UIO - I added hover/focus/contrast etc (second page) - haven\'t updated scenarios fully yet
