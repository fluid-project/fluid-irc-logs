2016-07-06T15:04:16 <danayo> jhung not sure if you noticed my commit last night to docs-guidelines (tried tagging you in a comment)
2016-07-06T15:04:35 <danayo> I aligned the main header, and increased tab size (and corresponding font size)
2016-07-06T15:04:43 <danayo> but couldn't figure out how to make the icons larger
2016-07-06T15:04:58 <danayo> and not sure if my approach is the best one
2016-07-06T15:05:06 <jhung> ok. I'll take a look danayo
2016-07-06T15:05:10 <danayo> thanks jhung

2016-07-06T15:50:28 <danayo> jhung if you have time today to talk about guidelines styling I can meet anytime - but it can wait until tomorrow if you're busy with community meeting prep etc
2016-07-06T16:00:49 <jhung> danayo: Sure. I'll let you know. I'm going to try to wrap up a few things here first.
2016-07-06T16:00:59 <danayo> ok
