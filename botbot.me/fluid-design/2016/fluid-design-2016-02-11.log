b"2016-02-11T21:12:48 <danayo> how's this Justin_o: The First Discovery Tool provides an introduction to the experience of discovering and setting preferences to meet an individual\xe2\x80\x99s needs. It helps digital newcomers learn about what kinds of personalizations are possible, and what might work for them. This tool assists learners with a broad range of needs to create a portable preference set that they can later refine and apply to any digital device that they may
2016-02-11T21:12:48 <danayo> encounter in their everyday life. It introduces the idea of setting digital preferences in an unintimidating and engaging way.

2016-02-11T15:35:43 <colinclark> no problem :)
2016-02-11T15:38:25 <jhung> danayo: that\'s all colinclark\'s work. I just fixed some formatting. :)

2016-02-11T16:13:11 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2016-02-11T16:13:28 <jhung> danayo: maybe later this afternoon danayo?
2016-02-11T16:13:44 <jhung> Maybe after 1:30?
2016-02-11T16:15:52 <danayo> sure jhung, i have a meeting from 2-3 ET
2016-02-11T16:16:24 <jhung> danayo: sure let\'s play it by ear. It\'s not super urgent.
2016-02-11T16:16:28 <jhung> alanharnum, sepidehshahi_, danayo: I\'m adding a link to the Floe site to the chart authoring demo. How does this text sound? "The Floe Chart Authoring tool demonstrates how audio can enhance comprehension of complex data. This demo works best with a browser supporting the Web Speech API like Google Chrome."
2016-02-11T16:17:09 <alanharnum> cindyli colinclark ^
2016-02-11T16:17:22 <alanharnum> I might use "explore" instead of "demonstrates", but i\'m a bet-hedger :)
2016-02-11T16:17:33 <alanharnum> s/explore/explores
2016-02-11T16:17:50 <jhung> alanharnum: explore sounds more epic.
2016-02-11T16:18:47 <colinclark> yeah, I was going to say about "demonstrates" as well
2016-02-11T16:18:50 <colinclark> good suggestion
2016-02-11T16:18:52 <sepidehshahi_> I like explore alanharnum. and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about complex data
2016-02-11T16:19:10 <colinclark> yes :)
2016-02-11T16:19:13 <alanharnum> agree with sepidehshahi_
2016-02-11T16:19:13 <colinclark> in our case, very simple data
2016-02-11T16:19:22 <jhung> then just "data".
2016-02-11T16:19:44 <alanharnum> i would like some day to be building sonifications for datasets with hundreds or thousands of items :)
2016-02-11T16:19:50 <alanharnum> but that\'s in the future
2016-02-11T16:21:02 <jhung> I\'m thinking of dropping "Floe" before "Chart Authoring" tool as well. I mis-read it as "Flow Chart Authoring" which isn\'t what we\'re showing.
2016-02-11T16:22:03 <danayo> +1 to all jhung
2016-02-11T16:22:50 <danayo> colinclark do you have a working doc of the HCI paper?
2016-02-11T16:24:52 <colinclark> danayo: I have a Word Doc I can send you, yes
2016-02-11T16:25:20 <danayo> ok, thanks colinclark (apologies if you already did...)
2016-02-11T16:25:38 <colinclark> no no, it\'s fine
2016-02-11T16:25:52 <colinclark> I am hoping Bosmon2 might be able to help us put it into a template
2016-02-11T16:26:24 <colinclark> but we should work on it in word for now and then hopefully we can convert it to LaTeX or whatever thing makes the templates easy

2016-02-11T18:41:33 <jhung> danayo: I\'m adding a link to the Inclusive Design Guidelines to the Floe site. What do you think of this text? "Floe is creating Inclusive Guidelines for Good Practice - an engaging way to discover Inclusive Design and Learning prinples, practices, and tools."
2016-02-11T18:42:02 <jhung> Anything else we should add to that?
2016-02-11T18:50:25 * michelled joined the channel
2016-02-11T18:51:01 <danayo> how about this jhung: Floe is creating Inclusive Design Guidelines for Good Practice - an engaging resource for learning about and applying Inclusive Design prinples, practices, and tools to the design process.
2016-02-11T18:51:53 <danayo> i was finding the "design and learning principles..." a bit confusing
2016-02-11T18:52:01 <danayo> maybe we don\'t need "...to the design process"
