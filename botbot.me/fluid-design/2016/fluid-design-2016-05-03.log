2016-05-03T15:20:43 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi, when you have a chance could you put the latest user states and contexts / flowers&petals stuff in owncloud?
2016-05-03T15:20:55 <danayo> is there a high contrast version of US&C?
2016-05-03T15:21:11 <sepidehshahi> absolutely danayo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll add the folder right after the stand up
2016-05-03T15:21:16 <danayo> thanks!
2016-05-03T15:21:27 <sepidehshahi> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any high contrast versions

2016-05-03T17:22:49 <sepidehshahi> hi danayo, I just cleaned up the US&C folder content and moved the unique instances to owncloud. the folder is shared with you.
2016-05-03T17:23:33 <danayo> got them sepidehshahi, thanks very much! I added a file there too - was creating some sample mappings with the reversed version (and increased the contrast somewhat as well)
2016-05-03T17:24:33 <sepidehshahi> awesome danayo! if you could, please  move the Design Guidelines folder under the Inclusive Resources and Tools. since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t created that folder It seems that I can\xe2\x80\x99t move it
2016-05-03T17:24:49 <danayo> will do sepidehshahi
2016-05-03T17:24:54 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot
2016-05-03T17:25:01 <sepidehshahi> it\xe2\x80\x99s great we can share again:)
2016-05-03T17:25:49 <danayo> it sure is!
