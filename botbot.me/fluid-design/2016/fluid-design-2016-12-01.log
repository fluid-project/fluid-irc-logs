2016-12-01T16:49:29 <jhung> danayo: the concept of exploring privacy as a persona sounds like an awesome basis for an indie game.
2016-12-01T16:49:40 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-01T16:49:43 <danayo> for sure jhung!
2016-12-01T16:50:37 <danayo> i\'m picturing the player being pursued by hundreds of eyeballs jhung :)
2016-12-01T16:51:04 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-01T16:51:10 <jhung> that sounds more like a horror-thriller game. I\'m totally not into those danayo! :D
2016-12-01T16:51:16 <danayo> haha
2016-12-01T16:51:32 <danayo> cute eyeballs, jhung?
2016-12-01T16:53:36 <jhung> danayo: and wore funny monocles. :)
2016-12-01T16:53:56 <danayo> :)
2016-12-01T16:55:17 <jhung> danayo: www.gamingprivacy.org
2016-12-01T16:55:41 <jhung> "Gaming Privacy is a Canadian game development and research project aimed at creating a privacy literacy game created with children, for children."
2016-12-01T16:56:26 <danayo> cool jhung. have you tried it?
2016-12-01T16:56:49 <jhung> Nope. Maybe someone at the office can load it onto the iPad there? Justin_o want to give it a try?
2016-12-01T16:56:56 <jhung> (My ipad is too old)
2016-12-01T16:57:05 <danayo> hat-based augmented reality
2016-12-01T16:57:35 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: sure i\'ll try to put it on the iPad here
2016-12-01T16:58:43 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2016-12-01T16:59:02 <danayo> Petor the Puffball!
2016-12-01T16:59:06 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: what\'s the app called?
2016-12-01T16:59:06 <danayo> looks fun
2016-12-01T16:59:09 <jhung> Hey danayo, a member on the advisory board on that privacy game is Sara Grimes - she\'s an IDI member. https://gamineexpedition.blogspot.ca/ and http://inclusivedesign.ca/people/#Grimes
2016-12-01T16:59:19 <danayo> oh cool jhung
2016-12-01T17:00:22 <jhung> It\'d be cool to have her come in to do a community meeting about privacy, gaming, and children danayo, Justin_o.
2016-12-01T17:00:29 <danayo> for sure jhung
2016-12-01T17:00:48 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: looks like you can play the game online http://play.watchersgame.com/
2016-12-01T17:00:54 <danayo> I can contact her jhung, Justin_o
2016-12-01T17:01:20 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks, i hope she can make it
2016-12-01T17:01:34 <jhung> awesome danayo. This has some interesting overlap with our experiences with PhET.
2016-12-01T17:02:04 <jhung> Justin_o: Does it require Flash? I\'m stuck on loading 104%\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-12-01T17:02:13 <danayo> looks like it does jhung :(
2016-12-01T17:02:22 <jhung> :(
2016-12-01T17:04:12 <Justin_o> i use chrome whenever something requires flash
2016-12-01T17:04:15 <Justin_o> usually that works
2016-12-01T17:04:30 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: let me know if you guys are still having trouble
2016-12-01T17:04:43 <danayo> it\'s working in chrome for me
2016-12-01T17:05:50 <Justin_o> also, i can\'t find the iPad app, maybe it hasn\'t come out yet?
2016-12-01T17:06:09 <Justin_o> is Kara a cat or a dog?
2016-12-01T17:06:54 <danayo> Justin_o :)
2016-12-01T17:07:03 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2016-12-01T17:07:06 <danayo> I\'m stuck on entering a tool code
2016-12-01T17:07:23 <Justin_o> i\'m watching the intro video now
2016-12-01T17:09:03 <Justin_o> danayo: you might need this pdf http://watchersgame.com/pdf/gamekit.pdf
2016-12-01T17:09:25 <Justin_o> it\'s the physical part of the game that is supposed to be used with the app
2016-12-01T17:09:50 <danayo> thanks Justin_o, i see the codes there
2016-12-01T17:10:49 <Justin_o> yah i think we really need the physical board laid out to really understand the game
2016-12-01T17:11:17 <danayo> sounds like it Justin_o
2016-12-01T17:11:20 <Justin_o> perhaps we could try this at a design crit or the back half of the community meeting next week if it doesn\'t run the whole time
2016-12-01T17:11:39 <Justin_o> it will be more difficult for you to do remotely, but we could probably get the cameras and screen sharing to work
2016-12-01T17:11:41 <Justin_o> i think
2016-12-01T17:11:49 <danayo> sure Justin_o, I think that would be good
2016-12-01T17:12:10 <danayo> no skip option for the intro Justin_o :(
2016-12-01T17:12:18 <danayo> :)
2016-12-01T17:12:25 <Justin_o> danayo: that\'s so annoying isn\'t it
2016-12-01T17:12:35 <danayo> yessss even though i love the robot
2016-12-01T17:12:38 <Justin_o> :)
2016-12-01T17:12:46 <danayo> it\'s very ET-like
2016-12-01T17:14:02 <Justin_o> that\'s nostalgic
2016-12-01T17:15:16 <Justin_o> the robot does really look like ET, I hadn\'t thought about that the first time i saw it
2016-12-01T17:15:24 <danayo> I <3 ET
2016-12-01T17:16:10 <Justin_o> i was eating recess pieces from Bert\'s stash yesterday
2016-12-01T17:16:36 <danayo> :D
2016-12-01T17:17:34 <danayo> it might be time to watch that movie again Justin_o
