2016-09-29T19:32:33 <Kobi> Jess_ what\'s up

2016-09-29T19:33:32 <Kobi> Jess_: It\'s good, thanks, just waiting for David123 to finish up his bit
2016-09-29T19:34:08 <Jess_> Kobi: David123: so tomorrow let\xe2\x80\x99s start by talking about it and then you can continue to refine it and do another iteration. sound ok?

2016-09-29T19:51:39 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: is there a wcag requirement for contrast of placeholder text?
2016-09-29T19:55:33 <lliskovoi> Justin_o that\'s a tricky one, technically it\'s the same as all text, but we\'ve often overlooked it, as long as there\'s an adequate label visually and programmatically.
2016-09-29T19:56:54 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: okay that makes sense.. what about disabled buttons?
2016-09-29T19:57:58 <lliskovoi> Justin_o: again, technically all page on the text needs to meet the requirement (I just double checked the WCAG page and it does apply to placeholder text same as other text)
2016-09-29T19:58:41 <lliskovoi> my suggestion would be to have a different indicator for whether buttons are inactive or not
2016-09-29T20:01:05 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: we\'ve tried to do things thing for our contrast modes like adding diagonal stripes through it.. but it\'s interesting in terms of a control or piece that you want to de-emphasize.. because adding something novel like the diagonal lines may actually draw more attention to it
2016-09-29T20:03:07 <Jess_> lliskovoi: ping
2016-09-29T20:03:49 <lliskovoi> Justin_o what about adding something like more dimension to the active and have the inactive look more flat? It\'s a touch challenge for sure!
2016-09-29T20:03:54 <lliskovoi> Hey Jess_
2016-09-29T20:04:11 <Jess_> lliskovoi: are you around tomorrow at all? And might we move our MOnday meeting up to tomorrow?
2016-09-29T20:04:36 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: yah for sure.. maybe something worth talking about at our next design crit
2016-09-29T20:04:54 <lliskovoi> I will be in tomorrow, but I have an important deadline at 7pm and might not have time until it\'s all submitted
2016-09-29T20:05:06 <lliskovoi> plus I won\'t have time to look over the document before we meet
2016-09-29T20:05:16 <Jess_> lliskovoi: ok, no worries
2016-09-29T20:05:21 <Jess_> we can figure out when next week works
2016-09-29T20:05:31 <Jess_> there is not a hurry on this
2016-09-29T20:05:43 <lliskovoi> Justin_o good idea! it\'s touch when you\'re trying to go against existing convention because then there\'s the issue of break expectations, which can be very inaccessible
2016-09-29T20:06:19 <lliskovoi> Jess_ ok, does Monday no longer work for you? I\'m happy to move it to a more convenient day
2016-09-29T20:06:36 <Jess_> lliskovoi: i think i\xe2\x80\x99m going to be taking Monday off so it\xe2\x80\x99s looking like it won\xe2\x80\x99t work
2016-09-29T20:06:47 <Jess_> we can figure out another day when you\xe2\x80\x99re less busy!
2016-09-29T20:06:55 <lliskovoi> Justin_o autocorrect made me sound all sorts of illiterate there haha
2016-09-29T20:07:13 <lliskovoi> Jess_ haha, hopefully that day will come!
