2016-02-18T19:00:45 <danayo> sorry
2016-02-18T19:00:56 <danayo> missed this
2016-02-18T19:01:00 <Justin_o> danayo: hello
2016-02-18T19:01:10 <Justin_o> no problem, not in rush.
2016-02-18T19:01:26 <danayo> they\'re on the wiki here:https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+%28Learner%29+Options+Mobile+and+Responsive+Design

2016-02-18T19:18:11 <danayo> hi jhung, sepidehshahi, colinclark: in the bottom section of this document I am writing the content for the guidelines cards. if you have a chance to provide feedback or contribute that would be fabulous. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoQCNCsbTjm5-1FTv-UixLyqWrkWtJNYHEe-SA1i-6I/edit?usp=sharing
2016-02-18T19:18:25 <danayo> "Definitions" section
2016-02-18T19:18:40 <sepidehshahi> for sure danayo
2016-02-18T19:25:44 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I was worried that the Practices should be more specific/concrete/detailed, but then decided that refering to the Tools would provide the specifics (i.e. define the specifics under each tool). what do you think? do you think this would satisfy needs of P4A stakeholders?
2016-02-18T19:29:12 <sepidehshahi> I thik this is a really good strategy. I think moving from Principles > Practices > tools content goes from theoretical/conceptual to practical/concrete. And practices are somewhere in between. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s good that you don\xe2\x80\x99t get into specifics. I\xe2\x80\x99ll read the practices in detail and let you know if there are areas that could be more concrete
2016-02-18T19:29:17 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-02-18T19:29:25 <danayo> thanks
2016-02-18T19:29:56 <sepidehshahi> thank you:)
2016-02-18T19:38:18 <jhung> danayo: reading it now.
2016-02-18T19:38:30 <danayo> thanks jhung

2016-02-18T19:41:57 <jhung> danayo: I\'m reading over the definitions. I\'m wondering about the deterministic quality of some of the statements . i.e. "inevitably fail". Is this tone intentional?
2016-02-18T19:43:48 <danayo> not particularly intentional jhung, could change that to likely or something else
2016-02-18T19:45:01 <jhung> danayo: yeah. I think that would make it a bit easier to read as well. Just worried we may come off sounding pessimistic / fatalistic.
2016-02-18T19:45:27 <danayo> yes, don\'t want that jhung :)
2016-02-18T19:45:57 <danayo> particularly about universal design - after our discussion at last crit I want to communicate that it\'s not all bad
2016-02-18T19:45:59 <danayo> jhung
2016-02-18T19:47:36 <danayo> perhaps more like this, jhung? We all have diverse needs and find ourselves in a variety of unique contexts. Universal or one-size-fits-all designs can sometimes fail to meet our needs; particularly as those needs change over time.
2016-02-18T19:50:37 <jhung> @sepidehshahi https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Presentations
2016-02-18T19:51:29 <jhung> sepidehshahi: https://validator.w3.org/checklink
2016-02-18T19:51:53 <jhung> you can set the recursion depth to 3 and check that option.
2016-02-18T19:53:06 <jhung> danayo: that sounds much better. Universal design definitely has its place in a particular context.

2016-02-18T20:11:05 <danayo> colinclark I was soliciting some feedback on this doc - when you have a chance - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoQCNCsbTjm5-1FTv-UixLyqWrkWtJNYHEe-SA1i-6I/edit?usp=sharing
2016-02-18T20:11:17 <colinclark> I\'ll take a look
2016-02-18T20:11:20 <danayo> in the bottom section of this document I am writing the cards content
