2016-02-02T16:07:34 <sepidehshahi> jhung1: one of the master students has sent me a PDF chart and asked how we would recommend making it accessible. I was wondering if you could help me out since you have more experience with charts and diagrams
2016-02-02T16:08:16 <sepidehshahi> jhung: Ah. I can send you links to some resources.
2016-02-02T16:08:17 <sepidehshahi> [11:04am] sepidehshahi: great, thanks
2016-02-02T16:08:18 <sepidehshahi> [11:05am] jhung: The most basic is a data table, but that requires the user to interpret and understand the relationships and meaning.
2016-02-02T16:08:19 <sepidehshahi> [11:05am] jhung: More easily done for pie charts and bar graphs with small data sets.
2016-02-02T16:08:20 <sepidehshahi> [11:06am] sepidehshahi: This is a bit more complicated and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it could be shown on a table. let me send it to you on Skype
2016-02-02T16:08:37 <jhung> I\'m taking a look now at the diagram sepidehshahi.
2016-02-02T16:09:26 <sepidehshahi> thanks jhung
2016-02-02T16:09:57 <jhung> This is a challenging one sepidehshahi. I think for a diagram like this it won\'t make much sense to try to do a literal translation of the visuals into text form.
2016-02-02T16:10:48 <jhung> In this case it may be more sensible to provide textual observations as well as some interpretation. Similar to how it is done in research papers that have a lot of data.
2016-02-02T16:11:02 <jhung> Also these links may (or may not) help: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/

2016-02-02T16:11:19 <sepidehshahi> I know, do you think if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to some how program/define the reading order in html?
2016-02-02T16:12:34 <jhung> sepidehshahi: the "reading order" is typically how it appears in the HTML code (the DOM). Are you thinking that it needs to be different than this?
2016-02-02T16:13:32 <jhung> This one too sepidehshahi may help: http://diagramcenter.org/accessible-dynamic-scientific-graphics.html
2016-02-02T16:18:27 <sepidehshahi> thx jhung. This digram is more like an activity flow digram, where there are two branches for Yes and No and each of those branches can lead to more results. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I was thinking about an interactive reading order. So, the user starts from the first box, then based on user\xe2\x80\x99s selection the reletaive results are shown. So, we don\xe2\x80\x99t present everything at once and only describe the path that user has selected. I think at
2016-02-02T16:18:27 <sepidehshahi> this point I have really confused you;)
2016-02-02T16:19:00 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ll send these links to here and a summary of our conversation. Hopefully she can figure this out.
2016-02-02T16:22:32 <jhung> lol. sepidehshahi. I can see how that might be useful. But it strikes me as a situation where you would want to give multiple / different opportunities to experience and understand the visual information.
2016-02-02T16:24:10 <jhung> The issue with a "choose your path" type interaction is that you only experience the information on the path you\'re on, and you don\'t get a sense of how that information relates to everything else. Visually you can "see" these relationships. But what if you can\'t perceive it? What other forms of the visual will we need to present?
2016-02-02T16:26:44 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely right. It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to present differnt options all at once with a visual representation. However, that gets very tricky and confusing for users who rely on other means than visual. that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the challenges we even had with the pie chart sonification. We were not able to show the relationships between the pieces and the whole chart.
2016-02-02T16:28:04 <jhung> sepidehshahi exactly. Which is why in situations like this I feel it\'s better to have multiple options, "renderings", or interpretations and let the reader choose what suits them best.
2016-02-02T16:29:03 <sepidehshahi> yes, exactly.
