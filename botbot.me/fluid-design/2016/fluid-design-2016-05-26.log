2016-05-26T13:44:55 <jessm> jhung: interesting thing: http://www.wired.com/2016/05/smart-home-hubs-apps/
2016-05-26T13:50:28 <jhung> Thanks jessm - I\'ve been keeping my eye on that space. Personally I have resisted buying into it because the technology is changing and evolving so quickly.
2016-05-26T13:51:11 <jessm> jhung: yeah, it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s promising to be a hub for whatever IoT device you get but it warns you that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be limited still to what the hub can recognize!
2016-05-26T13:51:21 <jessm> just moved the goal post back a bit but it\xe2\x80\x99s still there

2016-05-26T19:06:06 <danayo> there are 2 trailers
2016-05-26T19:06:21 <danayo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDTxstUyrM8
2016-05-26T19:09:39 <jessm> also a soundtrack \xe2\x80\x94 piano plus traffic
2016-05-26T19:09:48 <jessm> oops, danayo ^
2016-05-26T19:10:38 <danayo> where is the silence jessm???
2016-05-26T19:10:50 <jessm> danayo: sensory deprivation chambers
2016-05-26T19:10:55 <danayo> it\'s up to you to find it :)
2016-05-26T19:11:11 <colinclark> That was always John Cage\'s point
2016-05-26T19:11:20 <colinclark> even in sensory deprivation chambers, there\'s still sound
2016-05-26T19:11:26 <danayo> yes!
2016-05-26T19:11:27 <danayo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber
2016-05-26T19:12:48 <danayo> apparently you can hear your nervous system in one of those colinclark
2016-05-26T19:13:18 <jessm> maybe here? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_tank
2016-05-26T19:13:45 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2016-05-26T19:14:20 <colinclark> there\'s all kinds of embodied sounds
2016-05-26T19:14:27 <colinclark> otoacoustic sounds
2016-05-26T19:14:41 <colinclark> I guess what\'s interesting isn\'t that there\'s sound or silence
2016-05-26T19:14:54 <danayo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus
2016-05-26T19:14:54 <colinclark> but how we can "modulate" them with different approaches to attending to sounds
2016-05-26T19:16:02 <colinclark> turning them into silence
2016-05-26T19:16:05 <colinclark> or into music
2016-05-26T19:16:10 <colinclark> or other things :)
2016-05-26T19:17:48 <danayo> I\'d like to turn the sound of the garbage trucks into music! is there an app for that? :)
2016-05-26T19:18:52 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-05-26T19:18:52 <jhung> danayo: I\'m ready to chat now
2016-05-26T19:19:53 <danayo> ok jhung
2016-05-26T19:20:43 <simonjb> danayo: https://youtu.be/vKt1LThV89E re: garbage trucks music
2016-05-26T19:21:15 <danayo> hilarious simonjb - could get confused with an ice cream truck!
2016-05-26T19:21:29 <jhung> ^danayo I was thinking the same!
2016-05-26T19:21:31 <simonjb> a recent episode of the 99% invisible podcast was about recycling and about the recycling trucks in Taipei

2016-05-26T20:14:42 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, I just shared a screenshot of the integrated tracking option into the journal with you
2016-05-26T20:15:43 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2016-05-26T20:16:10 <sepidehshahi> The only concern that I have here is that the user has to select to track goals, to-dos or preferences individually everytime there is an entery.
2016-05-26T20:17:57 <sepidehshahi> or if they determine the tracking setting those, tracking options can be automatically turned on/off, and user can adjust them. for example, if they decide to track goals, all goals tracking options will be turned on, and user can turn off tracking for a specific goals, danayo
2016-05-26T20:18:43 <danayo> i see your point sepidehshahi
2016-05-26T20:18:50 <danayo> that could get very cumbersome
2016-05-26T20:19:24 <danayo> yes, I think if they track a goal, this means that all goals are tracked sepidehshahi
2016-05-26T20:20:38 <danayo> not sure about turning off individual ones ... thinking through the use case for that
2016-05-26T20:21:17 <sepidehshahi> so, if they turn on tracking for a goal in their journal, from that point all their goals will be tracked?
2016-05-26T20:22:14 <danayo> That\'s what I was thinking, but I\'m not sure yet the best way to convey this in the interface - how to indicate that all goals will be tracked
2016-05-26T20:23:10 <danayo> kind of a prompt - if I promote something to a goal, for example, a prompt like "track your goals" appears ? or something like that
2016-05-26T20:23:33 <danayo> maybe it\'s not an icon that appears beside the goal, but rather a general prompt, sepidehshahi ?
2016-05-26T20:24:08 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo, let meplay with it and see how it works out
2016-05-26T20:24:13 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi
2016-05-26T20:26:52 <sepidehshahi> do you imagine the same kind of prompt for preferences, danayo?
2016-05-26T20:28:02 <danayo> yes, i think it would have to be the same sepidehshahi
