2016-11-08T17:57:25 <danayo> alanharnum: I\'m thinking it would be cool for the MyL3 UI to have a toggle from a "build view" to the regular view ("action view" or something like that) - in the build view the user would be able to remove and add items in the notebook, and perhaps also add building blocks to the UI. (Where the UI would start with a few suggested/default items). What do you think about that? Is it something we could realistically implement?
2016-11-08T17:59:50 <alanharnum> danayo: yes, I think that would be a realistic to implement, and a good chance to exercise some of the components
2016-11-08T18:08:40 <jessm> lliskovoi: danayo: ready to meet with Sepideh?
