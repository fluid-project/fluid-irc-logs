2016-10-20T17:24:25 <danayo> jhung: any idea how I would assign alt-text to the logo svgs that are referenced from the handlebars file? i.e. {{> floeLogo}} etc ?
2016-10-20T17:25:16 <danayo> or Justin_o ^ ?
2016-10-20T17:25:50 <Justin_o> danayo: that\'s probably one for jhung, i\'m not sure how it\'s implemented at the moment, but could take a look if you need
2016-10-20T17:31:12 <Justin_o> danayo: actually you might want to add it to the SVG directly. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4697100/accessibility-recommended-alt-text-convention-for-svg-and-mathml
2016-10-20T17:31:43 <danayo> thanks Justin_o. I\'m not sure the best approach - the logos are links, and I could just give them a title, I guess, which appears on hover
2016-10-20T17:34:04 <Justin_o> danayo: when it\'s rendered the svg is wrapped in an <a>?
2016-10-20T17:34:13 <danayo> yes
2016-10-20T17:34:27 * danayo_ joined the channel
2016-10-20T17:34:28 <danayo> at least, that\'s how I\'ve done it Justin_o
2016-10-20T17:34:33 <Justin_o> ah
2016-10-20T17:34:35 <Justin_o> okay...
2016-10-20T17:35:01 <danayo> but I also want to style the title/tooltip (esp. for the contrast states), and it sounds like that might be tricky
2016-10-20T17:35:11 <Justin_o> danayo: so you\'ve done something like <a href="...">{{> floe logo}}</a>
2016-10-20T17:35:29 <Justin_o> danayo: yah, you\'d probably need to use a custom tooltip widget for that
2016-10-20T17:36:10 <danayo> yes, that\'s what I\'ve done Justin_o.
2016-10-20T17:36:27 <danayo> how do you mean, use a widget?
2016-10-20T17:36:41 <Justin_o> danayo: i mean, not relying on the browsers tooltip
2016-10-20T17:37:07 <Justin_o> danayo: you would have to make your own, or use one from a css or js framework
2016-10-20T17:40:22 <danayo> ok Justin_o, thanks.  is there something we\'ve used before that I could re-use?
2016-10-20T17:44:37 <Justin_o> we\'ve mostly used the fluid.tooltip, which wraps jQuery UI\'s tooltip widget
2016-10-20T17:45:21 <Justin_o> danayo: we\'d probably want to check in with jhung about that though, as we might have to make a new build of infusion to use with the docs
2016-10-20T17:45:31 <danayo> ok Justin_o, thanks

2016-10-20T18:29:54 <jhung> there\'s an approach we\'ve been using already (see the diagram on the front page). It\'s the same approach alanharnum documented here in the Handbook: http://handbook.floeproject.org/SVGAndAccessibility.html
2016-10-20T18:29:59 <jhung> ^danayo
2016-10-20T18:31:17 <danayo> thanks jhung. so, would you say then that it\'s better to apply alt text to the svg, rather than a title to the link (when the svg is a link)
2016-10-20T18:31:44 <danayo> or would have a title on it be a better way to indicate that it is a link ?
2016-10-20T18:31:49 <danayo> *having
2016-10-20T18:32:35 <danayo> seems like a different case than just an image - since its function is different
2016-10-20T18:32:41 <jhung> danayo: you would put the alt text with the actual content that needs it. The link would describe the link it\'s "going to".
2016-10-20T18:33:15 <danayo> ok, that means we need bot a title for the link, and alt-text for the logo svg?
2016-10-20T18:33:17 <danayo> jhung
2016-10-20T18:33:27 <danayo> *both
2016-10-20T18:35:21 <jhung> danayo: we should be careful using the title attribute since screen readers handle it differently. See https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/01/html5-accessibility-chops-title-attribute-use-and-abuse/
2016-10-20T18:36:48 <jhung> If we need to have an image link without any visible text, then we should probably use another way of labelling it. I\'m thinking some non-visible text and use aria-describedby?
2016-10-20T18:37:06 <jhung> lliskovoi, Justin_o: any thoughts on how best to do this?
2016-10-20T18:39:32 <danayo> ah, thanks jhung

2016-10-20T18:44:18 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'d think an aria-label would probably be enough for the logos
2016-10-20T18:44:31 <Justin_o> i suppose we might also want to add the role=image, but not sure it\'s necessary
2016-10-20T18:45:58 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: sorry i might not have been caught up enough, you are talking about the anchor tag now?
2016-10-20T18:47:21 <danayo> Justin_o: we\'re still discussing how to best label the logos in the footer, which are svgs, and which we\'d also like to link to appropriate webpages
2016-10-20T18:49:33 <Justin_o> danayo: i think in terms of screen reader it will readout the whole URL for the link
2016-10-20T18:49:36 <Justin_o> and announce it as a link
2016-10-20T18:51:11 <danayo> ok Justin_o, but I\'m thinking it would be better if it read a "title" like "FLOE project", rather than the whole URL. do you agree Justin_o, jhung?
2016-10-20T18:51:46 <danayo> or maybe not ...
2016-10-20T18:56:25 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: would you like to do a quick vidyo call
2016-10-20T18:56:31 <jhung> sure
2016-10-20T18:56:46 <jhung> your room Justin_o?
2016-10-20T18:57:31 <danayo> sure
2016-10-20T18:57:44 <Justin_o> danayo: my room

2016-10-20T19:30:28 <lliskovoi> jhung: danayo Justin_o sorry I\'m late to this discussion. I would say use an aria label with the link destination
2016-10-20T19:30:54 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: you\'re welcome to join the call in my vidyo room if you want
2016-10-20T19:36:00 <jhung> danayo: <a aria-label="Floe Project" href="\xe2\x80\xa6."><svg\xe2\x80\xa6></svg></a>
