2016-06-29T15:22:18 <danayo> would be great if we could try out that MyChart / mood tracker Jess_ - tried to register but you have to be pre-registered with a listed organisation

2016-06-29T15:34:39 <Jess_> danayo: bummer \xe2\x80\x94 i wonder if we can reach out to them
2016-06-29T15:35:52 <danayo> yes Jess_, even if they could share a few screenshots, would be great
2016-06-29T15:36:27 <Jess_> danayo: let\xe2\x80\x99s figure out who to ask
2016-06-29T15:38:42 <Jess_> they seem to have a general admin acct. i also pinged JT to see if she has a contact she\xe2\x80\x99d like us to reach out to

2016-06-29T15:52:11 <jhung> danayo: whenever a category is selected, a .docs-guidelines-category-Practices/Tools/Principles/Activities class gets added to the <body> element of the HTML. This way you can style custom colours depending on the category by doing css / stylus blocks like this: .docs-guidelines-category-Practices h2 { background-color: practicesColor; }
2016-06-29T15:53:13 <danayo> great jhung, thanks, i will try that for the highlight blocks in TOC and also titles on each page
2016-06-29T15:55:41 <jhung> danayo: if you look on lines 251 - 280 in the docs-design-guidelines.css.styl file, you can see where I've added custom colours for the borders depending on category. You can add your custom styles there.
2016-06-29T15:56:07 <danayo> perfect jhung, thanks
2016-06-29T16:05:36 <danayo> Jess_: could you send links to some of those TED Med talks you mentioned? Or the name of the designer?
2016-06-29T16:05:57 <Jess_> danayo: yeppers. though you might have already seen them
