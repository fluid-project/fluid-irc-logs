2016-06-08T18:51:24 <danayo> will do sepidehshahi
2016-06-08T18:59:16 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot danayo

2016-06-08T19:36:35 <danayo> sepidehshahi: the wireframes look great. one thing I noticed - I think it would be good to incorporate mood into the data plot somehow - in addition to changes to preferences
2016-06-08T19:36:54 <danayo> maybe in the hover text
2016-06-08T19:37:54 <danayo> "you changed your contrast setting ... you were feeling tired"
2016-06-08T19:38:06 <danayo> and we\'d also have to indicate this entry on the plot somehow
2016-06-08T19:38:45 <danayo> the mood entry I mean
2016-06-08T19:41:53 <danayo> sepidehshahi: also, regarding the data plot - I can imagine that tracking of typing speed etc would probably happen also on days when no changes to GPII are made
2016-06-08T19:42:48 <danayo> so we could indicate changes to GPII, and entries to journal on the x-axis, but data points may occur more frequently

2016-06-08T19:43:43 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel
2016-06-08T19:45:55 <sepidehshahi_> thanks danayo. Absolutely. for the mood entry, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first question that is asked from the user on the journal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to add that to the hover state as well. and for tracking the data, yes, they should happen any time user opens up the learning tool kit regardless of changing the preferences or not.
2016-06-08T19:55:09 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-06-08T19:56:18 <sepidehshahi> danayo: what do you think of the integration of the calendar in the second panel?
2016-06-08T20:01:27 <danayo> I think it works, sepidehshahi. I was wondering about the interaction - e.g. if the user selects one of the entries in the calendar, should it take them back to that journal entry (i.e. return to the journal with that particular entry highlighted)?
2016-06-08T20:02:50 <danayo> and I think "My Activities" should probably be called "My Timeline", to distinguish it from "My Calendar" (because they both show activities)
2016-06-08T20:02:55 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought danayo. For notes it can take them to that note. For all other items it can take them to their associated note and somehow highlight that item within the note
2016-06-08T20:02:57 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2016-06-08T20:03:18 <sepidehshahi> for sure
2016-06-08T20:05:41 <sepidehshahi> danayo: the main question I have here is for the My Data panel. Do you think we should always have it open or only if user has indicated that they want to track the changes they make to their GPII preferences?
2016-06-08T20:08:59 <danayo> yes sepidehshahi, it\'s got me thinking - that tracking changes to GPII prefs is different than tracking things like typing speed - one is an input, and one is an output, in a way - or - one is a cause, and one is an effect
2016-06-08T20:09:28 <danayo> so calling both of those things "tracking" seems a bit confusing
2016-06-08T20:11:07 <sepidehshahi> I know one is tracking the changes you make to your preferences and the other one is tracking your progress over time.
2016-06-08T20:11:20 <danayo> which doesn\'t answer your question at all sepidehshahi  :)
2016-06-08T20:11:23 <danayo> yes
2016-06-08T20:11:40 <sepidehshahi> :D that\xe2\x80\x99s ok, we are getting there
2016-06-08T20:12:09 <jhung> hey sepidehshahi! I heard you had an electrifying experience. :)
2016-06-08T20:12:45 <sepidehshahi> ;) yes jhung it was really cool to test out the sonified version of the sim:)
2016-06-08T20:13:27 <jhung> :) I was wondering if you wanted to talk about it sepidehshahi? I\'d like to write PhET an email tomorrow morning with our notes.
2016-06-08T20:14:14 <sepidehshahi> for sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for another 45 min if you want to talk tonight
2016-06-08T20:15:24 <danayo> sepidehshahi: maybe tracking changes to GPII just means that they show up on the timeline
2016-06-08T20:15:34 <jhung> Sure. Let me know when you\'re free sepidehshahi.
2016-06-08T20:15:42 <danayo> and My Data plot doesn\'t appear until the user tracks some output(s)/effect(s)
2016-06-08T20:17:26 <danayo> hmmm sepidehshahi: do you think we could combine the timeline and data plot in some way? is that too much?
2016-06-08T20:17:31 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo, so we only show GPII changes on the timeline and on the calendar views. and on My Data panel, when user hovers over a date, it shows a tooltip about what preferences have been changed that day and what the user mood was
2016-06-08T20:18:08 <danayo> I think that could work sepidehshahi
2016-06-08T20:18:24 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99ll try but it may be too much specially with goals and to dos, and it goes away from that causation Jess was talking about
2016-06-08T20:19:14 <danayo> well, it would still show where changes to GPII were made, as well as notes (which would include things like mood) - kind of like the x-axis of the my data plot is now
2016-06-08T20:20:21 <danayo> but yes, it would also include goals and to-dos, but I was thinking - it could be interesting to see how those relate to the things being tracked as well
2016-06-08T20:20:31 <sepidehshahi> yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the goals and to-dos that may cause confusion, anyway I\xe2\x80\x99ll try combining those two to see what happens and share the results with you
2016-06-08T20:20:56 <danayo> just a thought sepidehshahi, and perhaps at this point we should just stay on track with what we have
2016-06-08T20:21:41 <sepidehshahi> no worries danayo, I think this idea worth exploring. If I hit a block I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop
2016-06-08T20:22:23 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi
2016-06-08T20:22:23 <sepidehshahi> Thanks for all the feedback danayo, hopefully I\xe2\x80\x99ll have something ready for you to look at by tomorrow morning
2016-06-08T20:22:28 <danayo> grteat
2016-06-08T20:22:29 <danayo> great
2016-06-08T20:22:44 <danayo> thanks
2016-06-08T20:22:49 <sepidehshahi> jhung: can I call you
2016-06-08T20:23:19 <danayo> jhung can I try the sim somehow??
2016-06-08T20:29:03 <jhung> danayo: of course! Let me find you an URL.

2016-06-08T20:29:37 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-06-08T20:30:05 <jhung> danayo: want to join our call?
