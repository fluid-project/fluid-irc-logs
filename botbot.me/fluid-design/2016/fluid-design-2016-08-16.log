2016-08-16T15:52:57 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: webinar on digital asset management systems for those interested https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_rChKgVDV4&feature=youtu.be
2016-08-16T15:53:57 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: your updates at standup today got me thinking that we should version the design cards and even print the version number on the cards somewhere
2016-08-16T15:54:00 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2016-08-16T15:54:42 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-08-16T16:02:45 <jhung> Justin_o: Would this mean we'll start maintaining a version log as well so people can see what has changed from a particular version #?

2016-08-16T18:02:51 <jessm> gtirloni: hi oops, hi again
2016-08-16T18:03:48 <gtirloni> jessm: hi jess
2016-08-16T18:03:58 <jessm> gtirloni: i think lliskovoi and i figured it out \xe2\x80\x94 the flex url for Vidyo no longer works (which is a good thing) and now to use the web client you just hit the url from an invite with the desktop application closed, right?
2016-08-16T18:05:24 <gtirloni> jessm: yeah, that's right
2016-08-16T18:05:41 <gtirloni> jessm: they deprecated the flex url, but it's still used for the control panel i guess... but not for end users.
2016-08-16T18:05:49 <jessm> ok, cool \xe2\x80\x94 thanks for confirming gtirloni :)
2016-08-16T18:07:48 <gtirloni> :)

2016-08-16T18:30:48 <danayo> Justin_o, jhung: I think versioning and logging history for the guide is a great idea

2016-08-16T19:23:49 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-08-16T19:23:59 <Justin_o> jhung: and yes, i think a chnagelog is also a good idea
2016-08-16T19:35:57 <jhung> Justin_o, danayo: That will be interesting since some changes are minor / cosmetic, but some more significant. It sounds like a release process for the Guide\xe2\x80\xa6 not sure if that's a direction we want to take.
2016-08-16T19:40:26 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung : something worth talking about I guess. We could use the commit hash as the version but it's hard to know order in that case
2016-08-16T19:40:49 <Justin_o> or you could do something to print the date i guess
2016-08-16T19:41:27 <Justin_o> Although I think it's worth while to tag versions.. but it will add to the process overhead
2016-08-16T19:55:33 <michelled> tagging really only takes a moment. the bigger work would be determining when we want to cut them
2016-08-16T19:55:43 <michelled> but if we have a sense of that, I think it's a good idea
