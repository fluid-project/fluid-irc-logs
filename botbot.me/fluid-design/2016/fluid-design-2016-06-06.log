b'2016-06-06T21:01:20 <Justin_o> danayo: and drop "level 2" completely?
2016-06-06T21:02:40 <danayo> not sure Justin_o, just a thought - perhaps at the end of the FD game you can take your preferences and apply them to another game - the science game or math game etc
2016-06-06T21:03:07 <Justin_o> hmm.. interesting..
2016-06-06T21:03:20 <Justin_o> i\'m about to head out, but maybe we can chat more about this tomorrow before we talk to sparsh
2016-06-06T21:03:28 <danayo> that sounds good Justin_o, thanks
2016-06-06T21:03:44 <Justin_o> cool, talk to you tomorrow

2016-06-06T18:48:07 <danayo> Justin_o I was thinking perhaps we could use captions in the game a bit like this http://gamejolt.com/games/oh-i-m-getting-taller/154484
2016-06-06T18:50:39 <Justin_o> danayo: cool game
2016-06-06T18:50:45 <danayo> yeah
2016-06-06T18:50:52 <Justin_o> danayo: so in there the captions seem integral to telling the story
2016-06-06T18:50:55 <danayo> yes
2016-06-06T18:50:56 <danayo> so
2016-06-06T18:51:04 <danayo> I guess either audio OR captions would have to be on
2016-06-06T18:51:05 <danayo> or
2016-06-06T18:51:14 <Justin_o> yes, that would make sense
2016-06-06T18:51:29 <danayo> maybe the essential info is delivered another way
2016-06-06T18:51:42 <danayo> like speech bubbles or "tool" tips etc
2016-06-06T18:52:38 <danayo> not quite sure how that would work though
2016-06-06T18:53:14 <danayo> Justin_o are you having any trouble with the cursor disappearing in the game window? (I\'m using Chrome)
2016-06-06T18:53:24 <danayo> I couldn\'t get it to work at all in Safari or Firefox
2016-06-06T18:54:54 <Justin_o> danayo: i was using it in safari, the mouse disappeared there too, but i just clicked and it would progress the dialog.. and then used arrow keys to move
2016-06-06T18:55:09 <danayo> yes, same in Chrome
2016-06-06T18:55:48 <Justin_o> yah i\'m not sure about the alternate presentation. I sent you a pm before about jon\'s idea
2016-06-06T18:56:14 <Justin_o> which was to use a travel guidebook as the tool for the annotation/tooltips etc.

2016-06-06T20:27:27 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: I just got a figma account. so now we can try how we can collaborate with this app.
2016-06-06T20:27:43 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: cool.. i think danayo has an account too
2016-06-06T20:28:35 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: do you know if you can collaborate without using slack?
2016-06-06T20:28:48 <sepidehshahi> great danayo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can export one of the dashboard wireframes to figma tomorrow so we can have a conversation around it
2016-06-06T20:29:55 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Justin_o, I was going to use the feedback option in the app. it should probabely work like a google doc (just my assumption)
2016-06-06T20:30:26 <Justin_o> I hope it\'s that easy
2016-06-06T20:34:01 * michelled joined the channel
2016-06-06T20:39:50 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi let\'s try that tomorrow
2016-06-06T20:40:01 <sepidehshahi> for sure danayo
2016-06-06T20:47:55 <danayo> Justin_o I was also thinking that we need a stronger motivation for "level 1" - that it needs to be a stand-alone quest in itself - so I\'m back to thinking about the ball of yarn and perhaps the cat chasing it
2016-06-06T20:48:18 <danayo> and in following it, the cat comes across all the different rooms
2016-06-06T20:49:17 <danayo> and in each room there is a simple challenge that must be completed in order to move on
2016-06-06T20:50:39 <Justin_o> danayo: are you thinking they won\'t go into the rooms otherwise
2016-06-06T20:50:41 <Justin_o> ?
2016-06-06T20:51:06 <danayo> what do you mean otherwise, Justin_o?
2016-06-06T20:51:07 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2016-06-06T20:51:35 <Justin_o> danayo: meaning in the current design
2016-06-06T20:52:23 <danayo> Justin_o: i\'m just thinking that there needs to be a stronger motivation to make it a game in itself - stronger than just "preparing for the quest" - that in itself it is a quest
2016-06-06T20:53:03 <danayo> meaning that what we\'ve been calling level 1, or the preference-setting, is or could be a stand-alone game Justin_o
2016-06-06T20:53:16 <Justin_o> hmm.. i see
2016-06-06T20:53:45 <Justin_o> but we\'d need to tie it into the game as a whole somehow
2016-06-06T20:54:29 <Justin_o> i think as it stands right now, it doesn\'t feel like a level 1, but a different part of the game, that is like a home base i guess.
2016-06-06T20:55:31 <danayo> that\'s true
2016-06-06T20:55:50 <Justin_o> okay, so if we want it to be a true level one, then yes.. we should probably change it up a bit
2016-06-06T20:56:54 <Justin_o> in which case maybe the cat has to find the pieces of the map around the house and each task requires them to explore their preferences in each room as well
2016-06-06T20:57:14 <Justin_o> so enter a room, get a tool, try out the preferences, get a piece of the map
2016-06-06T20:57:45 <Justin_o> danayo: ^
2016-06-06T20:59:52 <danayo> we could do that Justin_o
2016-06-06T21:00:07 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-06-06T21:00:14 <danayo> I was actually thinking ... that maybe we need to make the preference discovery/setting a complete game
