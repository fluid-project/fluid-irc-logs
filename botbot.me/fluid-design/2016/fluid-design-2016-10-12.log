2016-10-12T13:33:38 <jessm> alanharnum: i just wanted to check in with you re: DEEP \xe2\x80\x94 two things
2016-10-12T13:33:43 <jessm> 1. official hashtag
2016-10-12T13:33:53 <jessm> 2. triple check that you have twitter access
2016-10-12T13:35:35 <alanharnum> jessm: 1. I like #deepconf16 as the official hashtag, since it\'s not colliding with any other conference usage, but am amenable to other options if you have ideas
2016-10-12T13:36:51 <alanharnum> 2. I\'ll make a test tweet from Tweetdeck quickly to make sure nothing has changed since I last checked I had access
2016-10-12T13:37:50 <alanharnum> jessm: access looks fine
2016-10-12T13:38:01 <jessm> alanharnum: awesome!
2016-10-12T13:38:04 <jessm> i like the hashtag too
2016-10-12T13:38:23 <jessm> i\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on a slide and we\xe2\x80\x99ll project it
2016-10-12T13:39:02 <alanharnum> great

2016-10-12T16:54:57 <Justin_o> jessm: would you be able to tell me the difference between thick and thin data?

2016-10-12T17:38:51 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-10-12T17:53:27 <colinclark> Justin_o: Maybe you got a response to your question already
2016-10-12T17:53:45 <colinclark> but the term originally comes from Clifford Geertz\' anthropology work: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick_description
2016-10-12T17:53:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: not yet
2016-10-12T17:54:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks i\'ll read through that
2016-10-12T17:54:03 <colinclark> "not just the behavior, but its context as well"
2016-10-12T17:55:22 <colinclark> It\'s interesting how the term has been, as is often the case, co-opted by marketers to capture the emotional valences of products
2016-10-12T17:55:39 <colinclark> but there\'s a decent blog post by a design enthographer about it: https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7#.n4zqwc5qc
2016-10-12T17:56:14 <colinclark> I think one of the keys to the way Jutta uses the term "thick" is to suggest that it\'s holistic data\xe2\x80\x94and it\'s your data
2016-10-12T17:56:36 <colinclark> "Thick Data reveals the social context of connections between data points while Big Data reveals insights with a particular range of quantified data points. Thick Data techniques accepts irreducible complexity..."
2016-10-12T17:58:04 <colinclark> Here\'s a link to the Geertz article in case anyone\'s particularly excited about diving into the, well, thickness of the concept :)

2016-10-12T18:01:08 * Yan_Hu1 has quit
2016-10-12T18:01:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks for all that
2016-10-12T18:02:10 <colinclark> I hope it\'s helpful
2016-10-12T18:02:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes i think so, thanks.. so i think the key point or a key point is thick data includes the data and the context
2016-10-12T18:03:08 <colinclark> yeah
2016-10-12T18:03:37 <colinclark> including the emotional, quality of life, and personal interpretive aspects of "data"
2016-10-12T18:03:42 <Justin_o> i\'ll probably have to read up a bit more to fully understand how that happens, that is, how it includes the context, but that\'s good start.
2016-10-12T18:04:03 <colinclark> so thick data also suggests that your personal interpretations and perspectives matter, not just the averaging effect of large data sets
2016-10-12T18:04:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, that\'s an important distinction
2016-10-12T18:05:44 <colinclark> MyL3 is a nice example of applying the idea
2016-10-12T18:06:04 <colinclark> it\'s the individual who decides what\'s important to track, and it\'s their data and interpretation that matters
2016-10-12T18:06:28 <colinclark> as you\'ve pointed out many times very thoughtfully, it can be very risky for the system to interpret, as opposed to the individual
2016-10-12T18:08:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, yes was interested in this for thinking about life long learning, so nice way to tie it back in
2016-10-12T18:09:11 <colinclark> yep :)
2016-10-12T18:10:32 <Justin_o> colinclark: i was also thinking about inherent risks of interpreting data by the individual if said individual doesn\'t know how to properly interpret the data or doesn\'t realize that key aspects are missing and etc.. for example developing superstitions, that is to say, misattributing the cause/effect or relationship of things.

2016-10-12T18:41:20 <colinclark> Justin_o: There\'s always going to be those kinds of risks, yes
2016-10-12T18:41:40 <colinclark> one of the things that I find particularly interesting is how to generate alternatives
2016-10-12T18:42:30 <colinclark> so when concerns come up, what kinds of ideas are out there to address those concerns, or totally different approaches and ideas that might avoid them
2016-10-12T18:42:44 <colinclark> My experience at DEEP in the past is that there will always be lots of concerns
2016-10-12T18:43:01 <colinclark> but the conversations get REALLY interesting when people start to improvise with ideas and solutions and approachs
2016-10-12T18:43:03 <colinclark> approaches
2016-10-12T18:44:14 <colinclark> people can be very creative in these sessions
2016-10-12T18:59:58 <Justin_o> colinclark: sorry, stepped away for a bit
2016-10-12T19:00:17 <colinclark> no problem!
2016-10-12T19:00:18 <Justin_o> yes, looking forward to hearing all the ideas and innovative approaches.
