2016-02-04T15:30:22 <Justin_o> danayo: I have a question about https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4c3pni6cnnwuts/uioptions%20GPII%20integration.pdf?dl=0 The reset is on the right side of the  hide/show button. Should this be the case for all instances of separate panel prefs editors or is this specific to this integration because of the export button?

2016-02-04T16:28:32 <Justin_o> talked to danayo about the above question.. the result is that the designs will be updated with the reset remaining in it's current location. This had to do with considerations for tab order, discoverability, and etc.
2016-02-04T16:28:43 <Justin_o> danayo: please correct any mistakes or omissions for the above
2016-02-04T16:31:04 <danayo> sounds accurate Justin_o

2016-02-04T18:57:33 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: can you help me? i can only get the webinar handout down to 1.6MB \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to get it smaller before sending out
2016-02-04T18:58:03 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: let me reduce the size of the file
2016-02-04T18:58:12 <Jess_> oh wait!
2016-02-04T18:58:28 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i just converted it to JPEG and it\xe2\x80\x99s much smaller \xe2\x80\x94 do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s ok?
2016-02-04T18:58:40 <Jess_> oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s only page 1
2016-02-04T18:58:50 <sepidehshahi> give me a min to try something
2016-02-04T18:58:56 <Jess_> ok
2016-02-04T19:02:43 <sepidehshahi> Jess_ the samllest size I can get to is 3.3 MB for a PDF, is it still too large?
2016-02-04T19:03:06 <Jess_> i got it down to 1.6!
2016-02-04T19:03:07 <Jess_> ok
2016-02-04T19:03:14 <Jess_> let me see if i can do more
2016-02-04T19:06:12 <sepidehshahi> I got to 2.5 MB. The images will be pixelated if I go lower than that Jess_
2016-02-04T19:06:59 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i\xe2\x80\x99m going to send you the 1.6MB i have \xe2\x80\x94 tell me if the images look crappy
2016-02-04T19:07:12 <sepidehshahi> ok
2016-02-04T19:10:30 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: the images look great
2016-02-04T19:10:39 <sepidehshahi> please go ahead and share
2016-02-04T19:10:44 <Jess_> ok
2016-02-04T19:18:30 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: ok, sent

2016-02-04T19:18:54 <sepidehshahi> thanks Jess_, I just sent you the last version of 404.2
2016-02-04T19:18:59 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i wonder if we should plunk both of those images into the GPII wiki? or perhaps we already are? Or that\xe2\x80\x99s the next step?
2016-02-04T19:19:07 <Jess_> re: 404.2 great!
2016-02-04T19:20:14 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: I was talking to kevin about adding that page in the GPII wiki as well. and it will be entrance for both the design kit and the economic model. Howevere, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what to call that page
2016-02-04T19:20:26 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: it failed to go to prosperity@ because of the attachment :(
2016-02-04T19:20:43 <Jess_> Inclusive Models?
2016-02-04T19:21:17 <sepidehshahi> good idea. What is the maximum file size we can share with the prosperity list?
2016-02-04T19:21:47 <Jess_> sepidehshahi:    Message body is too big: 2124736 bytes with a limit of 40 KB \xe2\x80\x94 not worth it. i think i should just point to a page in the wiki and resend to the prosperity list
2016-02-04T19:22:01 * amatas joined the channel
2016-02-04T19:23:00 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: let me see if I can add that page. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the link
2016-02-04T19:23:10 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: thanks muchly!
2016-02-04T19:23:21 <sepidehshahi> ;)

2016-02-04T20:05:40 <danayo> Justin_o: is there any way you can tell me what size the current (older) UIO font icons are?
2016-02-04T20:05:59 <danayo> I can't find the original svg files anywhere
2016-02-04T20:08:25 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: here is the GPII link. all my attempts make the image larger failed. please feel free to edit the copy. thx: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Inclusive_Models#Feb_2016_Webinar
2016-02-04T20:10:08 <Justin_o> danayo: i don't think so.. jhung do you have any ideas?
2016-02-04T20:15:02 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-02-04T20:18:01 <jhung> danayo: I can try to find them.
2016-02-04T20:19:38 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-02-04T20:19:48 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-02-04T20:22:55 <jhung> danayo: this jira had the font, but the attachment is gone. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4949?jql=text%20~%20%22icons%20uio%22
2016-02-04T20:23:13 <jhung> I have copies of Arash's files, I'm looking through that now danayo
2016-02-04T20:23:57 <danayo> great
2016-02-04T20:31:15 * gtirloni has quit
2016-02-04T20:31:37 <jhung> danayo: I found something. I
2016-02-04T20:31:45 <jhung> 'll put it into the dropbox.
2016-02-04T20:37:37 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: were you able to use this link? https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Inclusive_Models
2016-02-04T20:44:20 * danayo joined the channel
2016-02-04T20:45:27 <danayo> thanks jhung!
2016-02-04T20:48:08 <jhung> danayo: I've made copies of the SVGs I found into the dropbox. I was just talking to Justin_o - we may want to consider re-making the UIO icon font and version it properly in github.
2016-02-04T20:48:40 <jhung> I did find a version of the UIO icon font, but it's difficult to tell if it's the version that's used in UIO right now.
2016-02-04T20:48:55 <danayo> that sounds like a good idea jhung
2016-02-04T20:49:08 <danayo> where is the UIO icon font? the svgs you added all seem to be different sizes
2016-02-04T20:49:25 <jhung> I just copied the icon font now.
2016-02-04T20:49:37 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-02-04T20:49:46 <jhung> Unfortunately the SVG that's included with the font doesn't show anything editable danayo.

2016-02-04T20:51:08 <jhung> I was hoping to find an .ai file with all the icons, but there doesn't seem to be one. Only individual SVGs danayo. I'll keep looking though.
2016-02-04T20:51:27 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-02-04T21:07:16 <sepidehshahi> danayo: how did you add more space to your dropbox? I was checking my account and it\xe2\x80\x99s full because our shared files exceed 2 GB. is there an option that I should disable on my profile?
2016-02-04T21:08:43 <danayo> sepidehshahi: :(
2016-02-04T21:09:39 <danayo> at one point I sent myself an invitation at an alternate email address and signed up for another account - I think this gave me an extra 500MB :p
