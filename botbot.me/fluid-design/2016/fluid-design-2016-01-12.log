2016-01-12T15:32:23 <cindyli> danayo: regarding the design for UIO + GPII integration - https://www.dropbox.com/s/v4pn0e4pzy1e4x4/uioptions%20GPII%20integration.pdf?dl=0, do you have the font icon for the GPII panel, the icon displayed before the panel title, and the color code for the yellow used for buttons?
2016-01-12T15:35:09 <danayo> I\'ll get those to you cindyli - you mean the "show preferences" gear and the GPII preferences syncing cloud/gear, right? colour is fdd900
2016-01-12T15:35:46 <cindyli> yes, danayo. thanks for the colour code

2016-01-12T18:35:26 <cindyli> hi, danayo, i wonder if you could help to add font icons into our current UIO font icon files - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/src/framework/preferences/fonts
2016-01-12T18:36:16 <cindyli> or you can teach me how to combine two font icon files into one :)
2016-01-12T18:41:16 <danayo> I think the only way to do it cindyli is to remake the whole set, if I remember correctly
2016-01-12T18:41:26 <danayo> Justin_o: is that right ^
2016-01-12T18:41:27 <danayo> ?
2016-01-12T18:42:43 <Justin_o> danayo, cindyli: you\'d ned to rebuild the font from what i recall, but i think we have something that you could start with so that the new font would only be different in that it has the extra icons.
2016-01-12T18:46:13 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o.so i would bug you how to do the add-on tomorrow when i\'m in the office. this is not urgent anyway.
2016-01-12T18:52:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, but you\'d probably be better off talking to jhung
2016-01-12T18:53:19 <cindyli> haha. ok. thanks, Justin_o

2016-01-12T19:48:35 <danayo> michelled can you say more about the "people over processes" principle that you mentioned yesterday and how our daily connections meeting achieves that?
2016-01-12T19:48:58 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-01-12T19:55:02 <michelled> danayo: I think the full form of that principle is "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
2016-01-12T19:55:47 <michelled> and the daily connections meeting provides a time for people to draw connections between themselves
2016-01-12T19:56:41 <michelled> it\'s not a heavy weight meeting, it\'s an informal - this is what I did, this is what I\'m going to do
2016-01-12T19:57:12 <michelled> danayo: I\'m not sure what else to say about it - was there something in particular you wanted to chat about?
2016-01-12T19:57:15 <danayo> right, ok - and would you say we do it differently than other places? I guess they can be more formal
2016-01-12T19:57:33 <michelled> I think \'stand-up\' meetings are supposed to be informal
2016-01-12T19:57:42 <michelled> and I think most people keep them that way
2016-01-12T19:58:25 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-12T19:58:37 <danayo> ok, just trying to understand how it\'s an inclusive design practice. perhaps it\'s just inherently inclusive in that way
2016-01-12T19:58:59 <michelled> I think ours is a little different in that we also use technology to include people that are remote
2016-01-12T19:59:04 <danayo> right
2016-01-12T20:00:24 <danayo> I\'ve created a doc here with a table where I am trying to define Principles/Practices/Tools and how they relate to each other. If you have any thoughts please let me know! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoQCNCsbTjm5-1FTv-UixLyqWrkWtJNYHEe-SA1i-6I/edit#
2016-01-12T20:00:37 <danayo> Still struggling a bit with the slicing

2016-01-12T20:48:33 <michelled> I feel like verbalizing might be easier for me
2016-01-12T20:49:03 <danayo> sure michelled
