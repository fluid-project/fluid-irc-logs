2016-11-21T18:53:42 <jhung> fluid-everyone: For tomorrow's design crit I was thinking we can talk about Felipe's new icons (which we didn't have time for last week), and perhaps do an exercise related to Energy Skate Park. Does anyone else have anything to discuss?

2016-11-21T18:56:30 <danayo> that sounds good jhung. i don't have anything to discuss at this point
2016-11-21T18:57:08 <jhung> danayo: ok. I'll send out the emails after my 2p meeting.
2016-11-21T18:57:43 <danayo> thanks

2016-11-21T19:19:35 <jhung> Jess_: that was awesome.
2016-11-21T19:19:43 <Jess_> jhung: that\xe2\x80\x99s a first for me!
2016-11-21T19:19:47 <Jess_> it was awesome
2016-11-21T19:19:50 <jhung> Same!
2016-11-21T19:20:48 <jhung> To everyone else: Jess_ and I just sang Happy Birthday to Ned over our Slack conference call. It was awesome.
2016-11-21T19:21:05 <jhung> Slack had a tough time keeping up and kept cancelling people's voices though.
2016-11-21T19:21:16 <Jess_> jhung: i heard your excellent singing voice :)
2016-11-21T19:21:36 <Jess_> David123_: Kobi: Creative Commons licensing just came up in the last meeting I was in! Super relevant stuff \xe2\x80\x94 I was just glancing through the section on your project plan. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the question I have\xe2\x80\xa6 do you know how to license your site using Creative Commons once you\xe2\x80\x99re there?
2016-11-21T19:21:40 <jhung> lol
2016-11-21T19:22:24 <Kobi> Jess_:  Yes, I think I have a pretty good understanding of how to do that.
2016-11-21T19:22:34 <Jess_> awesome!
2016-11-21T19:22:53 <Jess_> Kobi: David123_: are you two diving into code today?
2016-11-21T19:25:32 <Kobi> Jess_:  We're attempting to. Both of us are trying to figure out GitHub right now.
2016-11-21T19:25:56 <Jess_> right! Kobi David123_ don\xe2\x80\x99t be shy to ask for help!
2016-11-21T19:26:41 <Kobi> Jess_:  OK, thanks!
2016-11-21T19:27:00 <Jess_> Kobi David123_: also, alanharnum danayo and I got to spend the morning watching a 10 year old play MineCraft \xe2\x80\x94 i feel cooler from just watching!
2016-11-21T19:27:27 <alanharnum> my recognition of all the World of Warcraft inspired mods he was using definitely made me cool
2016-11-21T19:28:02 <Jess_> alanharnum: he really looked to you for WoW wisdom! :)
2016-11-21T19:28:38 <David123_> Jess_: haha oh cool!
