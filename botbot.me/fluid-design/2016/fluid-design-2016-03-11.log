2016-03-11T14:59:13 <cindyli> Justin_o, jhung_away, i\'m testing this pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/675 that is to rewrite Pager.css in stylus and realizing that there probably is only a very small chunk of this css file is still in use. for example, the selector "fl-pager-ui" for identifying pager UI (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/pager/css/Pager.css#L20) doesn\'t appear anywhere in our demo or exampl
2016-03-11T15:00:29 <cindyli> i wonder if we should re-visit this css content and remove the parts that are no longer valid
2016-03-11T15:04:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: makes sense to only have the styles that are needed. There was another pull request related to pager css https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/674
2016-03-11T15:05:02 <Justin_o> there may need to be some migration of styles from the demos back to the component, or for the demos to make better use of the components styles.
2016-03-11T15:05:29 <cindyli> make sense. thanks, Justin_o
2016-03-11T15:09:13 <cindyli> Justin_o: do you think it makes sense to create a new jira for it or modify the jira that this student is working on to include new thoughts?
2016-03-11T15:09:25 <cindyli> i lean towards the latter
2016-03-11T15:10:15 <cindyli> or instead of making changes to the jira, i add a comment
2016-03-11T15:10:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds good
2016-03-11T15:11:05 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2016-03-11T15:11:27 <Justin_o> it makes sense to revisit the styles as they are converted.

2016-03-11T17:41:02 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I\'m going to send an email to the fluid-work list summarizing the work done so far on the website. Thanks for your help so far!
2016-03-11T17:42:44 <sepidehshahi> absolutely jhung. Just to let you know, there are some extra subpages on the sketches that are not listed in the google doc or the site map.
2016-03-11T17:43:23 <jhung> that should be fine sepidehshahi.
2016-03-11T17:56:30 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I just sent the email. Feel free to add any remarks to that thread.
2016-03-11T17:56:54 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks jhung

2016-03-11T21:14:11 <simonjb> which is running on a pretty interesting new journal platform
