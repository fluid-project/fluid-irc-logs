2016-05-31T18:47:46 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: alanharnum and lliskovoi, I was just talking with Sam and she suggeted that we participate in the Poster section of the ASSETS. Let me know what you think. We only need a 2 page abstract and the deadline is June 24th. And the good thing is that posters represent a work in progress which works better for us.
2016-05-31T18:48:49 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I think that sounds like a good idea
2016-05-31T18:49:21 <lliskovoi> colinclark, alanharnum sepidehshahi sounds good to me!

2016-05-31T20:46:11 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: I was exploring the option to combine the \xe2\x80\x98Reflect\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Review\xe2\x80\x99 sections as simonjb suggested yesterday. I think the new solution is much simpler than what we had yesterday. The rationale is changed a bit though. So, by tracking we mean only tracking the changes user makes to their GPII preferences, anything else, like journal enteries, addition of goals or to-dos, are not actually tracked, they are just
2016-05-31T20:46:11 <sepidehshahi> displayed on a calendar or a timeline.
2016-05-31T20:46:12 <sepidehshahi> https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/HV2gBds4rBZjD9v
2016-05-31T20:47:19 <sepidehshahi> the first page of the notes would be the Day view of a calendar. And to track GPII preferences changes you can set on/off in your GPII preferences panel.
2016-05-31T20:47:38 <colinclark> interesting
2016-05-31T20:47:42 <colinclark> I like this combined view quite a lot
2016-05-31T20:47:45 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: we could in the future add other data sources that are 'tracked'
2016-05-31T20:47:54 <sepidehshahi> I still need to figure out more details about this but first I wanted to make sure it has a potential before spending too much time on it.
2016-05-31T20:48:49 <sepidehshahi> sure simonjb, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of things I have to figure out where and how to integrate
2016-05-31T20:49:11 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I'm thinking of things like other personal data sources
2016-05-31T20:49:14 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: cool
2016-05-31T20:49:50 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right
