2016-06-28T15:11:04 <jhung> danayo: I\'ve pushed a few changes to my repository. You probably should fetch and merge my changes.
2016-06-28T15:12:04 <danayo> ok jhung. just git fetch jhung, right?
2016-06-28T15:12:28 <jhung> danayo: yep. then a git merge.
2016-06-28T15:12:35 <jhung> git merge jhung/master
2016-06-28T15:12:51 <danayo> right, thanks :)
2016-06-28T15:12:52 <jhung> danayo: also I noticed you added a PDF to the images directory. We should probably find a way to either shrink that file or find another place to host it.
2016-06-28T15:13:01 <danayo> ah, ok jhung
2016-06-28T15:13:27 <danayo> i\'ll try to shrink it
2016-06-28T15:13:47 <danayo> also, if i\'ve made some of my own changes this morning, do i need to commit them before i merge yours jhung?
2016-06-28T15:13:58 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-06-28T15:14:22 <jhung> yes. otherwise git will tell you that you have changes which may get overwritten by my work.
2016-06-28T15:14:44 <danayo> right
2016-06-28T15:14:52 <jhung> danayo: you can finish what you\'re working on and commit your changes before merging my changes.
2016-06-28T15:15:51 <danayo> ok jhung. and i just have to commit my changes, yes? or do i need to then wait for you to merge them?
2016-06-28T15:17:51 <jhung> you can commit your changes and merge my work. No need to wait for me to merge.
2016-06-28T15:19:21 <danayo> great, thanks jhung!
2016-06-28T15:24:22 <jhung> I\'m in the process of fixing the colours of the SVGs danayo.
2016-06-28T15:26:05 <danayo> great jhung. by the way i resized a couple of the icon svgs so that they look more equally-sized now
2016-06-28T15:29:03 <jhung> danayo: you resized them directly in the SVG file, correct?
2016-06-28T15:29:11 <danayo> that\'s right jhung
2016-06-28T15:29:25 <danayo> kept the artboard sizes the same
2016-06-28T15:29:29 <danayo> resized the shapes
2016-06-28T15:29:55 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-06-28T15:30:13 <jhung> ok. danayo with SVGs we can resize them using CSS \xe2\x80\xa6 which is sorta the reason why we\'re using SVGs in the first place so we can do these sort of adjustments easily.
2016-06-28T15:30:55 <danayo> ok jhung, i thought it would be important to have them all sized the same to begin with

2016-06-28T18:35:10 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi, jessm - would any of you like to join a meeting at 3pm for 1 hour regarding accessibility and inclusion of learning interactives / sims? This is a meeting facilitated by PhET to engage other orgs (some are textbook publishers). There\'s a high probability that today\'s meeting will discuss the use of personas, which I think some of you would be able to provide some nice insight (i.e. there\'s more to design th
2016-06-28T18:36:15 <danayo> sure jhung, i was wondering what that meeting was about
2016-06-28T18:36:56 <jhung> awesome danayo. Here\'s the meeting agenda https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MOfaIWPuAdk0ELInLA9qzVda6G38GMwy9oSAmYB3D9A/edit#
2016-06-28T18:37:45 <danayo> thanks
2016-06-28T18:38:17 <jhung> danayo: this is the link to the meeting https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/716567404 If you haven\'t used Zoom before you might be prompted to install it.
2016-06-28T18:38:33 <danayo> thanks jhung, i have used it
2016-06-28T18:39:03 <sepidehshahi> jhung: if there is still room, I would also like to join this meeting
2016-06-28T18:39:22 <jhung> sepidehshahi: sure. :)
2016-06-28T18:39:40 <sepidehshahi> awesome! thanks jhung
2016-06-28T18:42:02 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo - the group is a wide spectrum of folks - devs, project managers, researchers. Most are new to a11y.
2016-06-28T18:42:22 <sepidehshahi> ok, good to know
2016-06-28T18:42:30 <danayo> ok jhung
2016-06-28T18:43:46 <danayo> jhung, i\'ve finished adding all the links and icons to the "Try" and "How" etc lists on all the pages. Now going to start in on UIO styling issues, the colour-block styling we talked about, and some bulleted list styling

2016-06-28T18:45:33 <danayo> Also jhung I noticed that the "Edit this page in Github" links are broken - but couldn\'t figure out where to find that - I guess it\'s in the template somewhere?
2016-06-28T18:46:11 <danayo> (and i\'ve pushed all changes so far)
2016-06-28T18:48:07 <jhung> danayo: great. I\'ll take a look. And yes the github links are broken at the moment. I\'ll fix that - it\'s configured in one of the docpad files.
2016-06-28T18:48:16 <danayo> ah ok jhung
2016-06-28T19:34:40 <jessm> jhung: bummer to miss it \xe2\x80\x94 I was in another meeting
2016-06-28T19:34:45 <jessm> i\xe2\x80\x99d be excited to hear what happened

2016-06-28T19:50:29 <jhung> jessm: it\'s still going. We\'ve just been spending a lot of time tackling the issue of making the periodic table accessible.

2016-06-28T19:50:52 <jessm> woah, heavy metal
2016-06-28T19:51:00 <jhung> ^ bosmon you may be interested in this too. The technical implementation they are working on improving.
2016-06-28T20:24:44 <jhung> thanks for jumping into that meeting sepidehshahi and danayo!
2016-06-28T20:25:04 <sepidehshahi> thanks for including us jhung :)
2016-06-28T20:25:06 <jhung> Some really interesting design issues.
2016-06-28T20:25:26 <danayo> thanks jhung, super interesting
2016-06-28T20:26:00 <jhung> I\'m thinking of sending Kelly and Verna an invitation to a design crit. They have some really cool interactives with some gnarly accessibility and inclusion issues.
2016-06-28T20:26:21 <danayo> sounds good jhung
2016-06-28T20:30:23 <danayo> interesting jhung, i\'m using V/O in Chrome with that periodic table - i noticed that if you interrupt the audio on one element by tabbing to the next before it finishes, it will visually reveal the content of the new element, but then quickly switches to "blank" (and the audio reads only "blank"). i wonder why that is
2016-06-28T20:31:28 <jhung> I think it\'s related to the fact they\'re removing the aria markup once focus / hover leaves an element. Not sure why this is, if it is a bug or intentional.
2016-06-28T20:32:41 <jhung> There\'s stuff going on programatically which I think is really confusing the screen reader.
