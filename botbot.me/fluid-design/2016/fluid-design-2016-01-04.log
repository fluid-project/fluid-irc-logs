2016-01-04T16:52:10 <jessm> hey everyone the fluid crit is showing up on uraguayan time in my calendar and i think it\xe2\x80\x99s at the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d time \xe2\x80\x94 are the crits at 3?
2016-01-04T16:59:19 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-04T17:02:25 <danayo> jessm i believe design crit is at 1pm ET and dashboard meeting is at 2:30. they're all showing up an hour early for me
2016-01-04T17:03:14 * michelled joined the channel
2016-01-04T17:04:19 <jessm> danayo: do you also see them in duplicate?
2016-01-04T17:07:01 <danayo> no, not in duplicate jessm
2016-01-04T17:08:03 <jessm> ok, i\xe2\x80\x99m going to change those two recurring events to one hour later est and repeating each week
2016-01-04T17:09:05 <jessm> danayo: should be better now. if this is wrong we can change it of course
2016-01-04T17:09:42 <danayo> thanks jessm, looks good now
2016-01-04T17:10:31 <danayo> speaking of the crit everyone, does anyone have STUFF?
2016-01-04T17:12:20 <jessm> interesting article on the limits of big data and algorithms http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2016/01/how_facebook_s_news_feed_algorithm_works.3.html
2016-01-04T17:13:44 <jessm> \xe2\x80\x9cdata never tell the full story, and the algorithm will never be perfect\xe2\x80\x9d

2016-01-04T17:54:04 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: is there a design crit today?
2016-01-04T17:54:29 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think it's largely contingent on answers to danayo's question
2016-01-04T17:54:46 * danayo joined the channel
2016-01-04T17:54:56 <colinclark> fluid-everyone: Does anyone have STUFF for today's crit?
2016-01-04T17:55:12 <danayo> I have no STUFF colinclark
2016-01-04T17:55:28 <colinclark> I have no STUFF either
2016-01-04T17:55:45 <colinclark> except some lukewarm tofu for lunch
2016-01-04T17:55:53 <danayo> mmm
2016-01-04T17:55:54 <colinclark> but no one wants to critique that :P
2016-01-04T17:56:07 <danayo> i hope you have some SAUCE
2016-01-04T17:56:21 <colinclark> thankfully, yes
2016-01-04T17:59:43 <jhung> colinclark: I do not have anything today for the crit.
2016-01-04T18:00:04 <colinclark> ok
2016-01-04T18:00:13 <colinclark> It sounds like we can safely skip this week's crit
2016-01-04T18:00:31 <alanharnum> colinclark: your tofu is terrible
2016-01-04T18:00:35 <alanharnum> back to the drawing board for it
2016-01-04T18:00:39 <colinclark> alanharnum: ouch
2016-01-04T18:00:59 <colinclark> I thought my tofu really expressed my soul
2016-01-04T18:01:04 <colinclark> plus, tofu is highly adaptable
2016-01-04T18:02:32 <danayo> T4A
2016-01-04T18:02:40 <danayo> tofu for all
2016-01-04T18:06:46 <colinclark> hahaha

2016-01-04T18:41:22 <jhung> danayo: ping
2016-01-04T18:44:59 <danayo> hey jhung
2016-01-04T18:46:17 <jhung> When I go to EdReady on Jan 19-22, I'll be giving a little lunchtime presentation on inclusive design. I thought it may be a good opportunity to test some of the new ideas we've been thinking of for the Cards.
2016-01-04T18:46:31 <danayo> oh cool jhung, ok
2016-01-04T18:46:32 <jhung> I was thinking the card game may be a good ice breaker.
2016-01-04T18:46:37 <jhung> ^ danayo
2016-01-04T18:46:58 * zamcnema joined the channel
2016-01-04T18:47:40 <danayo> it would be good jhung, not sure how far we can get it by then, but would be a good chance to try it out - at least a simple version of it maybe
2016-01-04T18:48:01 <danayo> hi zamcnema, I see you found the design room :)
2016-01-04T18:48:42 <jhung> danayo: that's what I was thinking. I just wanted to give you some heads up on that as a possibility. We can chat about that some more later this week.
2016-01-04T18:49:01 <danayo> perhaps we can discuss with the group jhung - it would mean prioritizing that piece of the work, which is fine with me
2016-01-04T18:49:24 <danayo> sounds good jhung
2016-01-04T18:51:01 <danayo> zamcnema: I get your point about the persistence of the preview button
2016-01-04T18:51:13 <danayo> but I still think it makes less sense to group it with navigational buttons
2016-01-04T18:51:47 <danayo> as it's really about seeing the effect of the adjustment you've made
2016-01-04T18:52:02 <danayo> it could always appear in the same location
2016-01-04T18:52:13 <danayo> but be grouped with the adjuster section
2016-01-04T18:55:01 <zamcnema> the preview pane is going to be a preview page that is disabled/enabled using this button. the preview will be a context based web page mock up that that will have the enactors enable the preferences that the user has selected.
2016-01-04T18:55:57 <danayo> ah zamcnema so it's an open/close kind of thing - that is, once you open it, it stays open even as you move through different tool screens?
2016-01-04T19:04:18 <danayo> and where will the pane be located zamcnema?
2016-01-04T19:05:53 <zamcnema> next to the first discovery tool rectangle
2016-01-04T19:07:04 <zamcnema> The idea is that you can get a real world preview of you changing your preferences in addition to seeing them in the fdt
2016-01-04T19:07:20 <zamcnema> in a side by side manner
2016-01-04T19:07:38 <danayo> got it zamcnema
2016-01-04T19:07:49 <danayo> so the tool itself wil still respond to any adjustments?
2016-01-04T19:08:48 <zamcnema> yes, it will retain that functionality
2016-01-04T19:11:49 <danayo> we mocked up this idea early on zamcnema: https://www.dropbox.com/s/je1q1ejri6xghxg/PGA%20content%20preview%20example.pdf?dl=0
2016-01-04T19:12:04 <danayo> but here the tool itself would not respond until the user selected Confirm
2016-01-04T19:12:13 <danayo> anyway, just another way to approach it
2016-01-04T19:13:06 <danayo> and we didn't have an option to collapse the preview panel
2016-01-04T19:13:28 <danayo> I believe we were thinking that it would open automatically when an adjustment is made zamcnema
2016-01-04T19:13:42 <danayo> and close once Confirm was selected
2016-01-04T19:14:27 <zamcnema> Ah, yes, that did come up in a discussion earlier today. It could definitely just start opened or even be persistent.
2016-01-04T19:14:36 <danayo> yes
2016-01-04T19:15:24 <zamcnema> its very similar to the mock you linked me
2016-01-04T19:15:49 <zamcnema> I guess the question is whether there is a situation where we need to hide the preview or not
2016-01-04T19:16:22 <danayo> well, it really only makes sense for visual preferences
2016-01-04T19:17:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-01-04T19:17:30 <zamcnema> exactly.
2016-01-04T19:18:12 <danayo> so you'd probably not want it open for non-visual prefs - unless it was used to provide some added information about the preference or something
2016-01-04T19:18:20 <danayo> like for audio-based prefs
2016-01-04T19:18:35 <danayo> if it is collapsible, i think it would be best to default to open state, and if the user chooses to close it, they'll have learned that it's there, and have an better idea of how to open it again
2016-01-04T19:19:27 <zamcnema> I agree
2016-01-04T19:19:38 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-01-04T19:22:15 <danayo> also zamcnema - thinking that perhaps preview option should only be available once an adjustment is made, but not sure. I guess user would just see default state otherwise
2016-01-04T19:24:11 <danayo> but back to your original question about location of button zamcnema :)
2016-01-04T19:24:28 <danayo> we need to also consider the tab order for keyboard control
2016-01-04T19:24:52 <danayo> ideally the preview button would come right after the adjusters
2016-01-04T19:25:33 <danayo> and if the visual layout had it in between the next and back buttons, the focus order would appear strange
2016-01-04T19:28:28 <zamcnema> That makes sense to me. There isn't a whole lot of available real estate on the fdt, I could put it before the navigation so that the tab order makes sense, but it will make the tool taller.
2016-01-04T19:32:56 <danayo> yes. I wonder if we could have some sort of tab or button on  to the right of the adjuster somehow (since the panel will open to the right)
2016-01-04T19:33:02 <danayo> zamcnema ^
2016-01-04T19:37:30 <zamcnema> I could see that working
2016-01-04T19:40:03 * michelled joined the channel
2016-01-04T19:42:19 <danayo> dashboard meeting anyone everyone? not sure we have anything new to discuss since our meeting before break, I suppose we could review what we discussed then? or should we cancel til next week?
2016-01-04T19:42:45 <zamcnema> what kind of button do you think would work for that then? a thin vertical button with an triangle pointing right? or maybe an icon of some kind?
2016-01-04T19:49:35 <michelled> danayo: sorry, did a decision get made about the meeting?
2016-01-04T19:50:03 <danayo> no michelled, but I'd like to propose that we cancel and meet next week, if everyone is ok with that
2016-01-04T19:50:17 <jessm> danayo: works for me
2016-01-04T19:50:24 <michelled> I was going to say that it would be nice to get sepidehshahi up to speed with what we talked about
2016-01-04T19:50:56 <danayo> sepidehshahi I think you said you read the meeting notes? do you want to let me know if you have any questions?
2016-01-04T19:50:57 <michelled> I think she was away for our last meeting, right, danayo?
2016-01-04T19:51:07 <colinclark> I'm fine either way
2016-01-04T19:51:11 <sepidehshahi> michelled: I can talk to danayo about the last meeting and we can all meet next week
2016-01-04T19:51:12 <colinclark> but I can imagine we're all still getting up to speed
2016-01-04T19:51:21 <michelled> sounds good
2016-01-04T19:51:46 <danayo> great
2016-01-04T19:52:38 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I have read your notes on Wiki, I know you are busy with other things, please let me know when you have some time to talk about the personal assessment in the next few days

2016-01-04T19:59:34 <danayo> Yan_Hu would you like to join us? we're going to review the notes from the last meeting we had about the dashboard
