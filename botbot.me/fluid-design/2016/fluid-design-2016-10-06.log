2016-10-06T16:01:03 <danayo> ok jhung, lemme see if I can formulate a response to the email thread

2016-10-06T18:05:55 <danayo> jhung, alanharnum: am I right in understanding that the "end-user"/contributor would never see the Helper markup in the doc source?
2016-10-06T18:07:04 <jhung> danayo: they would, but it would appear like a handlebars function call. Sort of like how we have HB functions for getting the appropriate icons.
2016-10-06T18:07:56 <danayo> ok, thanks jhung
2016-10-06T18:08:04 <danayo> trying to wrap my head around this :)
2016-10-06T18:10:18 <jhung> danayo: The way I understand it is that the proposed solution is that whenever we find ourselves writing the same blocks of HTML over and over again, then we should probably take that and turn it into a Handlebars helper function. Then we\'d call that function (passing it the relevant info it needs) and it\'ll return HTML for us.
2016-10-06T18:11:34 <danayo> ok jhung - sounds like it wouldn\'t necessarily make the experience more "user-friendly" though ?
2016-10-06T18:11:55 * clown_mtg has quit
2016-10-06T18:12:32 <jhung> danayo: well, it won\'t make it easier or harder I think. If anything it\'ll reduce the need to deal with HTML, and possibly reduce human error.
2016-10-06T18:12:49 <jhung> the issue I see is that the author will need to be aware of these functions and know how to use it.
2016-10-06T18:13:05 <jhung> the good thing is that it can be copied from previous examples in the source, so that helps?
2016-10-06T18:17:58 <alanharnum> jhung danayo: yup, and we can document them
2016-10-06T18:18:17 <alanharnum> i don\'t think it\'s inherently more difficult than having to understand the HTML markup
2016-10-06T18:18:59 <alanharnum> and it reduces the potential for human error / makes updating designs easier by holding standard blocks of markup in one place

2016-10-06T18:22:28 <danayo> thanks jhung, alanharnum. My experience has been that it is actually more difficult to figure out what\'s going on (with functions and helpers). But that\'s probably not true for everyone.
2016-10-06T18:22:48 <alanharnum> danayo: well, your experience is valuable here
2016-10-06T18:23:04 <alanharnum> this all seems very useful to me, but that may be developer brain talking :)
2016-10-06T18:23:39 * clown joined the channel
2016-10-06T18:23:42 <alanharnum> the potential of the function/helper to reduce the ability to tell at a glance what is being done is one of my concerns as well
2016-10-06T18:24:05 <danayo> thanks alanharnum - I\'ll bring this discussion back to the list thread. And exactly what you said - I can\'t shake this thought about adding complexity in that way, and then sort of hiding that from the contributor and saying - here use this simple markup, you don\'t need to understand what\'s really happening behind the scenes. At the  same time, I can see that being useful for some!
2016-10-06T18:24:08 <alanharnum> the immediate comprehensibility of the document source code, if that makes sense
2016-10-06T18:24:20 <danayo> absolutely makes sense!
2016-10-06T18:24:45 <danayo> that has been my experience
2016-10-06T18:25:19 <danayo> alanharnum ^
2016-10-06T18:25:19 <alanharnum> problems like this are a tricky balance between the advantages of macros (repeatability) and the advantages of immediate comprehension
2016-10-06T18:25:34 <danayo> so interesting alanharnum
2016-10-06T18:28:39 <alanharnum> it\'s an important conversation to have, the last thing i want is to make our documentation & publishing systems harder to work with
