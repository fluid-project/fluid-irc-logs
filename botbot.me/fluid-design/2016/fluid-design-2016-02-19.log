2016-02-19T12:48:34 <Justin_o> jhung: i was just about to write up a GSoC project idea for the Icon Font build tool, but after looking at this grunt plugin you mentioned to me, i think we might be able to do it quickly ourselves. https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont
2016-02-19T12:48:57 <Justin_o> jhung: however, I just wanted to quickly talk over what it is that we'd want exactly, just to make sure it really isn't a larger project that a student could take on

2016-02-19T14:13:44 <Justin_o> jhung1 and I spoke over vidyo regarding the icon font build tool. At the moment it didn't seem like a large enough project for a GSoC student. There was already a JIRA filed for this issue, and I've left a couple more comments there. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5555
