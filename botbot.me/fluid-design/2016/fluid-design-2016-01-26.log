2016-01-26T21:40:31 <sepidehshahi> danayo: when you had a chance, please have a listen at this sonification piece. It is part of an adds-on to NVDA that sonifys SVG shapes and maps. let me know what you think of it. thx

2016-01-26T21:57:04 <danayo> I find it a bit hard to follow sepidehshahi, although after a second time the rectangles make sense
2016-01-26T21:57:27 <sepidehshahi> I had the same problem
2016-01-26T21:57:45 <danayo> i also find the sounds hard on my ears :)
2016-01-26T21:57:55 <sepidehshahi> the only interesting part for me was the combination of the screen reader and the sonification
2016-01-26T21:58:00 <danayo> right
2016-01-26T21:58:02 <sepidehshahi> I know!!!
2016-01-26T21:58:26 <danayo> yeah, it's interesting to think of sonification and navigation in this way sepidehshahi
2016-01-26T22:00:20 <sepidehshahi> yes. specially navigating a map. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good start but it can be improved, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how though;)
