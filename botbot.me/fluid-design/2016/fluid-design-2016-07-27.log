2016-07-27T18:16:09 <danayo> jhung: just issued a PR to add states and contexts mapping to the activities
2016-07-27T18:16:36 <jhung> ok got it. I'll take a look danayo.
2016-07-27T18:16:42 <danayo> thanks
2016-07-27T18:19:54 <danayo> jhung, actually, i just realised i'd like to add something else first - can I do another commit first? it will be automatically added to PR, right?
2016-07-27T18:20:42 <jhung> Yep. Go ahead.
2016-07-27T18:20:48 <jhung> danayo ^
2016-07-27T18:21:17 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-07-27T18:31:26 <danayo> done jhung. i was having trouble getting docpad to render the headings in the cause and effect activitiy doc - at least, i think it's just docpad issues
2016-07-27T18:33:41 <jhung> ok danayo I can take a look at that.

2016-07-27T18:38:37 <jhung> danayo: the headers look okay to me. Was there a particular problem?
2016-07-27T18:39:43 <danayo> great jhung, i think docpad just wouldn't render them for some reason
2016-07-27T18:40:14 <jhung> That's a little worrisome danayo. lol It looks okay on my side. They show up as H2s.
2016-07-27T18:41:02 <danayo> ok, that's good jhung. i had a similar problem before, don't know why
