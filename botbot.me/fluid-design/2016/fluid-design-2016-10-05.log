2016-10-05T16:36:56 <danayo> and did you notice the agreement at the bottom?
2016-10-05T16:37:11 <danayo> "By using the Deaf Artists and Theatres Toolkit (DATT), I commit to personal reflection, openness, exploration and collaboration."
2016-10-05T16:38:42 <danayo> I want to add something like that to our Guide

2016-10-05T18:37:01 <jessm> sound good?

2016-10-05T19:20:52 <colinclark> oh yes
2016-10-05T19:20:59 <colinclark> great idea
2016-10-05T19:21:17 <colinclark> i have a friend who does sound studies up at york who has been in their beta program
2016-10-05T19:21:37 <jessm> they seem really cool/promising
2016-10-05T19:21:54 <colinclark> yes
2016-10-05T19:22:04 <colinclark> keep the suggestions coming!

2016-10-05T20:07:16 <danayo> interesting Justin_o, I was thinking something similar - about the Kindle stat on text size
2016-10-05T20:10:19 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, exactly.. there\'s also social hacking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_hacking
2016-10-05T20:12:13 <Justin_o> which is a bit different but you can think of all the ways the someone could assemble various pieces of personal information into a substantial whole, and then use that to gain further access.
