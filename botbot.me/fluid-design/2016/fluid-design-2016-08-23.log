2016-08-23T16:08:24 <danayo> sepidehshahi: forgot to mention in standup our upcoming co-design session with Caren/Cal - I think I'll start a google doc with our ideas for activities - does that sound good?
2016-08-23T16:08:51 <danayo> and then perhaps we could meet later this week to discuss?
2016-08-23T16:10:23 <sepidehshahi> danayo: that sounds like a great plan. I\xe2\x80\x99ll add my ideas to the doc as well. we could also get feedback from the larger MyL3 team in our next meeting on Monday and then share with Caren
2016-08-23T16:10:35 <danayo> good idea
2016-08-23T16:10:49 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: framer just announced integration with figma. I think we were still looking at Figma as a potential tool for sharing and collaborating on designs
2016-08-23T16:10:49 <Justin_o> http://blog.framerjs.com/posts/import-with-figma.html
2016-08-23T16:12:14 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s great Justin_o! I still haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to play with Figma\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try my best to test it this week
2016-08-23T16:12:57 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks, no worries though if you don't have time

2016-08-23T20:31:49 <sepidehshahi> danayo: you did a great job summarizing the 3 dimensions
2016-08-23T20:33:00 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi, but I can't take credit - I actually took that content directly from the website!
2016-08-23T20:34:39 <danayo> sepidehshahi: here is the google doc I started for the co-design session. not much there yet! I thought I had more notes from our discussion https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_eUKHg5HyvdmGI0ND821nbChA-l7EleJk_Z-Ti63T90/edit?usp=sharing
2016-08-23T20:34:54 <sepidehshahi> cool! it is still more concise and readable:) in Practices we used to have the related principles in the Why section. Are we going to add the 3 dimensions to the pronciples or only include 3 dimensions now?
2016-08-23T20:35:33 <sepidehshahi> great1 thanks danayo
2016-08-23T20:36:33 <danayo> sepidehshahi: do you mean add the 3 dimensions to the Practices?
2016-08-23T20:37:52 <sepidehshahi> ah, I think I just got your point. So, you just wanted to add the 3 dimensions to the insights in the why section and not in all the other categories\xe2\x80\x99 why section. is it right?
2016-08-23T20:38:11 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-08-23T20:42:45 <danayo> sepidehshahi: yeah. at the moment there is a bit of a cascasding structure - but there are some practices and even tools that seem to relate more directly to dimensions (based on Jutta's definitions) - for example, Design for Flexibility and Adaptability - is mentioned in the defnition of Recognize Diversity and Uniqueness
2016-08-23T20:43:14 <danayo> ultimately, we probably don't want a cascadng hierarchy
2016-08-23T20:43:29 <sepidehshahi> makes sense danayo
2016-08-23T20:43:33 <danayo> and I was thinking there's no reason why we couldn't list dimensions in Practices or Tools etc
2016-08-23T20:45:08 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2016-08-23T20:46:06 <danayo> in the same way that in some cases, we list both tools as well as other practices in the How section of some of our Practices
2016-08-23T20:47:52 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure how insights will look like added to the dimensions for some practices or tools\xe2\x80\xa6 we may end up with a long list. But let\xe2\x80\x99s try it and see, it may actually work very well
2016-08-23T20:48:51 <danayo> true, it could get very messy and long
2016-08-23T20:52:20 <danayo> sepidehshahi: if you have any futher thoughts about that I'd love to hear them. I'm thinking that the Hows and Whys really reinforce the hierarchy of the cards, which we don't want. wondering how to suggest those connections without being so structured
2016-08-23T20:52:35 <danayo> how can we build a trellis?? :)
2016-08-23T20:55:03 <sepidehshahi> I totally agree with you danayo. It\xe2\x80\x99s much better if we have a mesh of dimensions, insights, tools and practices. The only thing I was worried about was how easy that is for a new user to absorb all the information and make those connections. I think we can talk about this in the next design crit
2016-08-23T20:55:44 <danayo> yeah, sounds good sepidehshahi
2016-08-23T20:56:06 <danayo> in the meantime sepidehshahi, here's a cool trellis http://theselfsufficientliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Flower-Trellis.jpg?17dcdd
2016-08-23T20:56:07 <danayo> :)
2016-08-23T20:56:25 <sepidehshahi> beautiful:)
2016-08-23T20:56:47 <sepidehshahi> I like how 3 dimensional it is!
2016-08-23T20:56:58 <danayo> yes!
2016-08-23T20:57:06 <danayo> and a tornado trellis!
2016-08-23T20:57:07 <danayo> http://daizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TornadoTrellis1.jpg
2016-08-23T20:57:25 <sepidehshahi> wow!!! this is crazy!
2016-08-23T20:57:31 <danayo> :D
