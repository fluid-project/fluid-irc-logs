2016-11-11T18:46:40 <colinclark> hey jhung, do you have time for a quick question?
2016-11-11T18:46:52 <jhung> sure colinclark
2016-11-11T18:47:09 <colinclark> So there\'s a small chance I might like to do a PhET demo
2016-11-11T18:47:24 <colinclark> and what I\'d love to be able to show is something that "maximally accessibility"
2016-11-11T18:47:40 <colinclark> something that shows keyboard navigation, AT support, and sonification in one
2016-11-11T18:47:46 <colinclark> but I wonder if such a thing even exists yet?
2016-11-11T18:47:58 <colinclark> or are they separate bits and pieces integrated into different sims
2016-11-11T18:48:51 <jhung> colinclark: John Travoltage is close (KB, text descriptions), but the sonification is a bit rough. Otherwise such a demo doesn\'t exist.
2016-11-11T18:49:00 <colinclark> ok
2016-11-11T18:49:11 <colinclark> would I demo Travoltage with VoiceOver or something?
2016-11-11T18:49:35 <jhung> Yeah. VO with Safari. Let me grab you a link colinclark. I think it demos well enough.
2016-11-11T18:49:43 <colinclark> thanks
2016-11-11T18:50:00 <colinclark> can you give me some times on how to best demonstrate it?
2016-11-11T18:50:05 <colinclark> a kind of workflow
2016-11-11T18:51:28 * clown joined the channel
2016-11-11T18:52:40 <jhung> colinclark: sure. Let me find you the right link and we\'ll go from there.
2016-11-11T18:52:48 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2016-11-11T18:53:44 <jhung> Here colinclark http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/john-travoltage/1.3.0-dev.7/john-travoltage_en.html?sonification=2&accessibility
2016-11-11T18:54:40 <jhung> It\'s good to start with mouse interaction first to get an idea of how that works. Then show how it can done using keyboard. Keyboard is done like standard HTML - tab to controls. Left and right to change.
2016-11-11T18:55:22 <jhung> I noticed the sonification doesn\'t work with KB access now for some reason. A shame.
2016-11-11T18:56:58 <colinclark> that\'s interesting\xe2\x80\x94I just noticed that too
2016-11-11T18:58:10 <jhung> You can turn the screen reader on at any point and you should hear updates and descriptions colinclark.

2016-11-11T19:18:02 <colinclark> thanks jhung, this is great
2016-11-11T19:18:10 <colinclark> I showed it off to a few people here at break and they liked it a lot
2016-11-11T19:18:21 <jhung> Awesome colinclark!
