2016-11-24T16:52:01 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: speaking of ai, google recently launched an site with some of their ai experiments. I haven\'t really played with it much so not sure how interesting they are, but thought I\'d leave it for anyone who was curious https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com
2016-11-24T16:52:25 <lliskovoi> thanks Justin_o!

2016-11-24T16:55:02 <Justin_o> also here\'s a video of what a tesla sees when it\'s autonomously driving https://www.tesla.com/videos/autopilot-self-driving-hardware-neighborhood-long
2016-11-24T16:57:36 <colinclark> lliskovoi: This was the Philip Agre article I mentioned at standup: http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/critical.html
2016-11-24T16:57:50 <lliskovoi> thanks colinclark!
2016-11-24T16:58:15 <colinclark> "As a practical matter, the purpose of AI is to build computer systems whose operation can be narrated using intentional vocabulary. Innovations frequently involve techniques that bring new vocabulary into the field: reasoning, planning, learning, choosing, strategizing, and so on. Whether the resulting systems are really exhibiting these qualities is hard to say, and AI people generally treat the question as an annoying irrelevance.
2016-11-24T16:58:15 <colinclark> What matters practically is not the vague issue of what the words "really mean" but the seemingly precise issue of how they can be defined in formal terms that permit suitably narratable systems to be designed."
