2016-12-12T15:17:19 <lliskovoi> danayo: alanharnum are we having a MyL3 meeting today?
2016-12-12T15:17:25 <danayo> alanharnum, lliskovoi, jessm, colinclark: neeta had asked if we could move the dashboard meeting (on a regular basis), and I was thinking it would be better to meet later in the week. Does Wed or Thursday at 1:00 work for everyone? Not sure your schedule these days lliskovoi
2016-12-12T15:17:48 <alanharnum> danayo: 1:00 Thursday would work for me
2016-12-12T15:18:06 <lliskovoi> danayo: 1pm on Thursday works for me too
2016-12-12T15:18:08 <jessm> danayo: i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of Thursday yet, but if others can do go for it
2016-12-12T15:25:06 <danayo> thanks alanharnum, lliskovoi, jessm, we\'ll tentatively reschedule for Thursday at 1 - hope that works for you too colinclark
2016-12-12T15:26:23 <colinclark> Thursdays at 1 pm should be just fine

2016-12-12T15:40:33 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: related to privacy, Mozilla partnered with Tactical Technology Collective to create an exhibit called the Glass Room
2016-12-12T15:40:44 <Justin_o> https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/08/mozilla-ttc-glass-room-new-york/
2016-12-12T15:41:42 <danayo> thanks Justin_o, it\'s very cool
2016-12-12T15:41:56 <danayo> wish we could all take a road trip :)
2016-12-12T15:42:01 <Justin_o> https://tacticaltech.org/projects/glass-room
2016-12-12T15:42:19 <Justin_o> yah, that would be awesome :)
2016-12-12T15:43:08 <Justin_o> also if you didn\'t see Amazon Go, that\'s also kind of related https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc
2016-12-12T15:44:41 <jhung> jessm: You commented the other day about the lack of "sexy" hearing aids. Looks like Bose is onto you! https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/10/bose-hearphones/
2016-12-12T15:45:14 <jessm> jhung: i hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen these! thanks
2016-12-12T15:45:42 <jessm> jhung: \xe2\x80\x9chearphones\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 love it
2016-12-12T15:46:36 <jhung> yeah. It\'s a great start. I hope other manufacturers jump on it and help give a variety of options.
2016-12-12T16:02:37 <danayo> Justin_o: thanks for the link re: Amazon Go - I hadn\'t seen that.
2016-12-12T16:03:40 <Justin_o> danayo: np, it slightly terrifies me, although it does look convenient
2016-12-12T16:04:02 <danayo> scares me too Justin_o! will there be any such thing as offline anymore ?
2016-12-12T16:04:13 <danayo> :)
2016-12-12T16:04:38 <danayo> and we\'ll have to add privacy preferences for "don\'t share how many cupcakes I buy" :)
2016-12-12T16:04:45 <Justin_o> danayo: lol
2016-12-12T16:05:47 <Justin_o> danayo: i can imagine they\'ll start sending you recipes based on what you buy, or will know you are throwing a party and suggest other things to buy for that
2016-12-12T16:06:37 <danayo> oh man, Justin_o: I see you bought hot dogs, don\'t forget the mustard!
2016-12-12T16:06:45 <danayo> grocery clippy!!
2016-12-12T16:06:52 <danayo> arrrrrghhhhhhh
2016-12-12T16:06:58 <Justin_o> fitting that it\'s in Seattle

2016-12-12T19:12:06 <jhung> jessm: The PB call was very short today. There was mention of a Learning Object Metadata discussion on Slack somewhere. I\'m trying to track that down. Funny how this stuff comes around.
2016-12-12T19:13:43 <jhung> Ah found the start of the discussion. It was on Dec. 3rd by Colomet in the opensource-themes channel.
2016-12-12T19:35:51 <jessm> jhung: thanks! I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch up as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99m done sketching with Kobi
