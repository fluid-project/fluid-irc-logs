2016-08-10T14:51:35 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo, I could quickly ask Jutta about the Cause and Effect activity. She said that she has not used it in her current intensive and instead used an activity for visrtous cycles (the Cobra effect)

2016-08-10T16:49:22 <colinclark> lliskovoi: I think I spoke too soon in regards to my schedule today :(
2016-08-10T16:49:33 <colinclark> I am booked from 2-3 pm in a meeting with IBM
2016-08-10T16:49:53 <colinclark> remind me when we just moved the community meeting?
2016-08-10T17:01:59 <lliskovoi> colinclark 2:30
2016-08-10T17:02:09 <lliskovoi> do you think half an hour will be enough?
2016-08-10T17:02:18 <colinclark> Seems like a good start
2016-08-10T17:02:35 <colinclark> so can we move the vidyo a11y conversation to 3 pm?
2016-08-10T17:02:43 <colinclark> and then we'll go to the community meeting at 3:30 pm
2016-08-10T17:03:16 <lliskovoi> works for me, Justin_ how does that sound?
2016-08-10T17:04:27 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: should be fine

2016-08-10T19:04:03 <colinclark> let me check my calendar--that could work
2016-08-10T19:04:35 <colinclark> I could do something before the meeting-no-longer-referred-to-as-the-dashboard-meeting :)
2016-08-10T19:04:49 <colinclark> or after
2016-08-10T19:04:56 <colinclark> 11:30-noon?
2016-08-10T19:05:02 <colinclark> oh wait, standup

2016-08-10T19:05:30 <colinclark> 10 am?
2016-08-10T19:05:40 <lliskovoi> that works great for me
2016-08-10T19:06:15 <colinclark> ok cool
2016-08-10T19:06:40 <colinclark> jessm, does that work for you?
