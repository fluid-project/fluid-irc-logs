2016-09-15T17:44:34 <jhung> thought some of you may find this interesting - Paralympic medals have beads inside of them so the medals make a different sound when shaken. The gold medal makes the loudest sound, while the bronze makes a quieter note.
2016-09-15T17:45:39 <danayo> that is interesting, jhung. very cool
2016-09-15T17:45:43 <jhung> There's also braille imprinted on them.
2016-09-15T17:46:10 <danayo> nice

2016-09-15T17:50:42 <jhung> Here's a video of Tharon Drake (USA swimming) receiving his Gold medal and giving it a shake. It's pretty awesome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld20vUnmc50
