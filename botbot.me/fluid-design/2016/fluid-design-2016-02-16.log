2016-02-16T15:00:21 <sepidehshahi> Hi michelled, neeta is asking about the dashboard meeting. Do you know if we are going to have one today at 10:30?
2016-02-16T15:04:51 * danayo joined the channel
2016-02-16T15:05:06 <michelled> sepidehshahi: I don't see it on the calendar so I assume not
2016-02-16T15:05:30 <michelled> danayo, Justin_o: I'm double booked at the moment and I won't be able to make our PGA checkin
2016-02-16T15:05:32 <michelled> I'm sorry
2016-02-16T15:05:50 <Justin_o> michelled, danayo: was that changed to 1pm?
2016-02-16T15:05:54 <danayo> michelled we moved the PGA meeting to later time
2016-02-16T15:05:57 <danayo> yes
2016-02-16T15:06:23 <michelled> did we change it forever?
2016-02-16T15:06:26 <danayo> thought i'd changed it in the calendar Justin_o michelled but looks like not
2016-02-16T15:06:30 <danayo> yes...FOREVER
2016-02-16T15:06:32 <danayo> :)
2016-02-16T15:06:32 <michelled> :)
2016-02-16T15:06:34 <sepidehshahi> michelled: as far as I remember in danayo last email, we moved it to Tuesdays at 10:30. I can forwrad you the last email
2016-02-16T15:06:35 <michelled> thanks :)
2016-02-16T15:07:37 <danayo> that sounds right sepidehshahi - sorry all, I think I did try to update calendar! I'll try again
2016-02-16T15:10:03 <sepidehshahi> no worries, danayo do you think you would have time for that meeting today? we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done much since last week..
2016-02-16T15:10:08 <Justin_o> danayo: I see the e-mail is PGA Checkin at 1:30pm now... I have a PhET meeting at 2pm every Tuesday, were we expecting these to just be 30 min.. I'll be fine if that's the case
2016-02-16T15:10:38 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I was thinking we should probably skip it this week
2016-02-16T15:11:10 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Neeta know. thanks
2016-02-16T15:11:25 <danayo> Justin_o: hmmm
2016-02-16T15:13:00 <danayo> how about 1:00 Justin_o
2016-02-16T15:13:11 <Justin_o> danayo: that should be fine for me
2016-02-16T15:15:50 <danayo> colinclark michelled does 1:00 for PGA checkin work for you (on a FOREVER basis)?
2016-02-16T15:16:10 <colinclark> yup, that works
2016-02-16T15:16:16 <colinclark> seems like a more civilized time for you, too :)
2016-02-16T15:16:22 <danayo> :D
2016-02-16T15:19:23 <michelled> yep, works for me too :)
