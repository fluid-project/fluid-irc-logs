2016-08-22T18:04:51 <sepidehshahi> or should we postpone it to next Monday on the regular time at 10:30
2016-08-22T18:04:56 <colinclark> I\'m going have to keepn on writing, sepidehshahi :(
2016-08-22T18:05:07 <colinclark> We\'ve got a deadline of 4 pm to ship this proposal
2016-08-22T18:05:25 <colinclark> but you should feel free to meet without me and keep going
2016-08-22T18:05:38 <sepidehshahi> sure colinclark, let\xe2\x80\x99s have our meeting on Monday at 10:30
2016-08-22T18:05:46 <colinclark> I\'ll be on vacation
2016-08-22T18:05:47 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: and danayo ^
2016-08-22T18:05:52 <colinclark> but the above comment still applies :)
2016-08-22T18:05:58 <danayo> colinclark: we had a productive meeting this morning
2016-08-22T18:06:03 <colinclark> awesome
2016-08-22T18:06:06 <colinclark> were Jim and Maureen there?
2016-08-22T18:06:11 <danayo> no
2016-08-22T18:06:18 <colinclark> ok, cool
2016-08-22T18:06:49 <colinclark> danayo: Whenever you next meet, can you summarize some of the points I learned in my last meeting with Jim and Maureen?
2016-08-22T18:07:06 <colinclark> I guess the key point being that the Pilot #1 won\'t be for a full year
2016-08-22T18:07:18 <colinclark> so we\'ve got some time to make some actual stuff, rather than just paper prototypes
2016-08-22T18:07:34 <danayo> colinclark: yes, i shared that with the group this morning
2016-08-22T18:07:43 <colinclark> oh perfect!
2016-08-22T18:07:44 <colinclark> thanks
2016-08-22T18:08:00 <colinclark> I since learned from Gregg that he\'s pretty adamant that he doesn\'t want short, fully attended pilots
2016-08-22T18:08:32 <colinclark> he wants to leave GPII machines at the AJC after the initial pilot intervention where Maureen and someone technical will be around asking questions and gathering feedback
2016-08-22T18:08:51 <colinclark> but the precise logistics of this elude me
2016-08-22T18:09:00 <danayo> oh, interesting colinclark
2016-08-22T18:09:03 <danayo> ok
2016-08-22T18:09:32 <colinclark> He\'s also become suddenly and fascinatingly interested in UI Options
2016-08-22T18:09:50 <danayo> I still wasn\'t clear if they\'d want to include a MyL3-like digital tool in the pilots, but since they\'re a long way off, i imagine we have lots of time to wow them
2016-08-22T18:09:58 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2016-08-22T18:10:15 <colinclark> plus, in the end, we will be designing and developing the metrics-gathering aspect of the pilots too
2016-08-22T18:10:22 <danayo> right
2016-08-22T18:10:27 <colinclark> so the two can be fruitfully interrelated
2016-08-22T18:10:35 <danayo> yes. and UIO as well!
2016-08-22T18:10:44 <colinclark> yep
2016-08-22T18:10:56 <colinclark> Gregg is very interested in the ability for the GPII to be able to transform web-based content in various ways to make it easier to read
2016-08-22T18:11:25 <colinclark> and has asked that, on the APCP technical development side of things, we reshuffle our development priorities to make a "Chrome extension version of UIO"
2016-08-22T18:11:47 <colinclark> that doesn\'t necessarily need to be directly integrated into the site by its developers/designers
2016-08-22T18:13:13 <danayo> wow, that\'s exciting colinclark
2016-08-22T18:14:18 <colinclark> could be interesting
2016-08-22T18:14:29 <danayo> at least, that sounds exciting to me. maybe not so to the APCP developers ?
2016-08-22T18:14:32 <colinclark> it does mean that some of our earlier concept sketches might be closer to reality than we thought
2016-08-22T18:14:38 <danayo> interesting
2016-08-22T18:15:30 <colinclark> well, I think the APCP developers will be excited about it
2016-08-22T18:15:49 <danayo> oh good :)
2016-08-22T18:15:57 <colinclark> jhernandez has done some work on the Chrome extension alongside Justin_o\xe2\x80\x94and it\'s always been the kind of thing we\'d wanted somehow resolve with UIO
2016-08-22T18:16:03 <colinclark> what do you think, Bosmon?

2016-08-22T19:39:39 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just remembered our co-design session with Cary Watkins\xe2\x80\x99s son on Monday September 10. When do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s good to begin planning for that?
2016-08-22T19:41:04 <danayo> good question sepidehshahi. it\'s sept  12, right? and we haven\'t heard back from her about a community meeting time, have we?
2016-08-22T19:41:47 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m getting all the dates wrong today!! yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s on Monday Sept 12
2016-08-22T19:42:37 <sepidehshahi> not yet, I tried reminding her when we rescheduled our community meeting but she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t picked a date yet. I guess she is on vacation now
2016-08-22T19:43:10 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-08-22T19:44:42 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi. I thought the community meeitng might help us in our preparations, but that\'s ok. i think we agreed to put some ideas together and get Caren\'s feedback first. so we should make sure there\'s enough time for that
2016-08-22T19:45:36 <danayo> so i guess we should get something to Caren by, say the 5th? or 6th?
2016-08-22T19:45:46 <danayo> maybe the 5th
2016-08-22T19:45:51 <danayo> so we have time to make changes
2016-08-22T19:46:11 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good point. Yes, the 5th sounds good to me
2016-08-22T19:46:20 <danayo> which leaves this week and next week to work on it sepidehshahi
2016-08-22T19:46:56 <sepidehshahi> and I think we are talking about MyL3 from a Floe learner\xe2\x80\x99s perspective and not the APCP job seeker. is that right?
2016-08-22T19:48:02 * colinclark has quit
2016-08-22T19:48:16 <danayo> yes, i think that\'s right sepidehshahi
