2016-05-04T14:27:49 <sepidehshahi> good morning danayo, I have finished working on the introduction and phase I sections. It would be great if you can review, revise and make changes, if you have time though:) thanks a lot
2016-05-04T14:28:38 <danayo> great, thanks sepidehshahi

2016-05-04T14:53:50 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I'm going to try to get to it this afternoon, just want to get this presentation in shape first,  hope that's ok
2016-05-04T14:54:47 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely fine:) that would give me time to finish Phase II.
2016-05-04T14:59:34 <danayo> great sepidehshahi

2016-05-04T15:49:14 <sepidehshahi> Hi alanharnum: was there any specific order that you and Lisa used to go through each sonification results? do you have any preferences, so I can work on the other ones?
2016-05-04T15:50:05 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I don't have a strong preference - Lisa was doing the work on sonification-by-sonification analysis - I'm working my way through thinking about the general feedback and how to present it
2016-05-04T15:50:20 <alanharnum> i'd say if you look at the sonification results Lisa hasn't got to yet you'd be fine
2016-05-04T15:50:32 <sepidehshahi> Oh great! thanks alanharnum

2016-05-04T20:21:20 <sepidehshahi> hi gtirloni_ do you know how I can get the attached images on the wiki to show up as image thumbnails instead of grey rectangles?
2016-05-04T20:22:12 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum
2016-05-04T20:22:32 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2016-05-04T20:23:35 <gtirloni_> sepidehshahi: is that in gpii's wiki? the only way i know of including an image is through [[File:name.jpg]] .. is that it?
2016-05-04T20:23:57 <sepidehshahi> it\xe2\x80\x99s the Fluid wiki and it seems to be very slow
2016-05-04T20:24:52 <danayo> sepidehshahi do you have a preference for comments vs. direct editing of the sections you have written?
2016-05-04T20:26:20 <sepidehshahi> danayo: it would be great if you do direct editing based on the time we have left
2016-05-04T20:26:31 <danayo> sounds good
2016-05-04T20:30:52 <gtirloni_> sepidehshahi michelled: the connection to the database entered a faulty state and didn't recover. i've restarted the wiki, please try again
2016-05-04T20:31:07 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot gtirloni_
2016-05-04T20:32:28 * clown has quit
2016-05-04T20:33:08 <gtirloni_> sepidehshahi: the wiki probably can't show pdf content that way, only images
2016-05-04T20:33:53 <sepidehshahi> I noticed that gtirloni_ but the JPEG thumbnails are very pixelated and show with such bad quality
2016-05-04T20:40:22 <gtirloni_> sepidehshahi: the images you added recently seem to be looking better. are they the same that were pixelated before?
2016-05-04T20:40:42 <gtirloni_> or is that still pixelated?
2016-05-04T20:40:57 <sepidehshahi> gtirloni_: this time I exported them as PNG files. they look much nicer than JPEGs
2016-05-04T20:42:37 <gtirloni_> confluence (the wiki software) creates the thumbnails internally.. i wonder if they have better support for PNG, or maybe the JPEGs had some compression that it wasn't handling well.
2016-05-04T20:43:08 <gtirloni_> i saw some errors saying confluence couldn't create thumbnails. i checked everything their docs said could be the issue but everything was alright
2016-05-04T20:43:24 <gtirloni_> with the latest images you added, i didn't see any errors
2016-05-04T20:56:54 <sepidehshahi> thanks gtirloni_ all the problems resolved and Jutta liked the page:) so we are good fo now
2016-05-04T21:01:15 <gtirloni_> awesome :)
2016-05-04T21:07:07 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think we could have the dashboard meeting tomorrow, or should we just focus on the paper and have it done by end of the day?
2016-05-04T21:10:27 <danayo> sepidehshahi: based on the work you did on monday do you think it would be worth a quick check-in with neeta? if not, I'm happy to postpone until next week

2016-05-04T21:11:59 <sepidehshahi> danayo: on Monday we discussed what we were planning to do. unfortunately I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to work on my part. Maybe Neeta has. we can have a quick chat maybe to stay on track
2016-05-04T21:12:22 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi, sounds good
