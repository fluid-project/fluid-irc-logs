2016-04-11T16:40:47 <alanharnum> I rigged up that second (duration-based) sonification we talked about previously
2016-04-11T16:41:12 <alanharnum> and made a stripped-down interface that only has the play/stop controls

2016-04-11T16:42:55 <danayo> alanharnum, thanks for getting that duration-based one working!
2016-04-11T16:43:03 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks alanharnum
2016-04-11T16:43:50 <danayo> how are we planning to use the stripped-down version alanharnum , sepidehshahi ?
2016-04-11T16:46:12 <alanharnum> mostly for our own convenience, i think

2016-04-11T16:58:44 <jhung> fluid-everyone: for today's design crit I'd like to talk about PhET's energy skate park. Does anyone have anything else to talk about?
2016-04-11T16:59:48 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I have to prepare some visualzations for Jutta this afternoon by 2:00. So, unfortunately I have to skip the design crit
2016-04-11T17:00:48 <jhung> sepidehshahi: ok. Is everyone pretty occupied today? Perhaps we could cancel today and pick it up next week?
2016-04-11T17:02:32 <danayo> jhung: I don't have anything for the crit.
2016-04-11T17:03:55 <danayo> (and I won't be around next Monday)

2016-04-11T18:32:06 <danayo> sepidehshahi: could you send me the final print files for the guidelines? I'm going to upload them to Resource Space
2016-04-11T18:32:56 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo: they are included in the email we send to the print shop. I have cc\xe2\x80\x99d you there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll forward it agan.
2016-04-11T18:33:04 <danayo> ah, that's ok
2016-04-11T18:33:05 <danayo> sorry

2016-04-11T18:51:47 <danayo> sepidehshahi: where did you get the Gotham-Book font from?
2016-04-11T18:53:25 <sepidehshahi> Murilo sent it to me in the summer. I can find that email and forward it to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s the official OCAD U font so we should ask the school to provide us this font danayo
2016-04-11T18:55:21 * colinclark has quit
2016-04-11T18:55:28 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, I think we try to use open (free) fonts generally, but I'm not sure. I can find a number of free downloads for Gotham-Book, but not sure if they are to be trusted
2016-04-11T18:56:01 <sepidehshahi> I just sent you the Gotham font danayo.
2016-04-11T18:56:10 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi

2016-04-11T20:24:33 <danayo> ok, thanks sepidehshahi. for some reason I'm having trouble instaling it
2016-04-11T20:25:01 <danayo> I try to install Gotham-Book, but it just installs Gotham, and then AI tells me it can't find Gotham-Book :(
2016-04-11T20:26:40 <sepidehshahi> I know that font is kind of broken it installs all the fonts in the family under the same name and you only get Bold amd regular\xe2\x80\xa6 Hopefully we get the right version from OCAD people
