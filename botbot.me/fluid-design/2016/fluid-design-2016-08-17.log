2016-08-17T15:07:21 <Justin_o> jhung: UIO desktop designs https://www.dropbox.com/s/80tx756fahb478l/UIO_mock.pdf?dl=0
2016-08-17T15:07:34 <Justin_o> danayo: were there others.. i think you weren\'t completely satisfied with these
2016-08-17T15:14:13 <danayo> that\'s where we left it Justin_o, jhung - I\'d like to change some of the naming (e.g. "visual style") as well as the on/offtoggle design (this is captured in the mobile designs at the moment). I could quikly mock up a desktop version if needed
2016-08-17T15:14:22 <danayo> probably a good idea
2016-08-17T15:21:26 <Justin_o> danayo: are you free for a call with jhung and i after standup today to talk over some of this
2016-08-17T15:23:32 <danayo> jhung, Justin_o: want to make sure I understand what you\'re suggesting - we would use tab to move focus from the game area to the (modal) backpack, then arrow keys to navigate through the pack, Enter to toggle/select, and ESC to leave the pack and return focus to game area?
2016-08-17T15:23:38 <danayo> ah - sounds good Justin_o
2016-08-17T15:23:50 <danayo> yes I can meet with you and jhung after standup
2016-08-17T15:24:40 <jhung> ok cool danayo
2016-08-17T15:25:28 <Justin_o> danayo: you could just tab to the backpack and arrow between them too, but they do seem more like checkboxes than radio buttons
2016-08-17T15:26:45 <jessm> sepidehshahi: danayo: others: learning dashboardyness https://www.summitlearning.org/
2016-08-17T15:27:18 <danayo> Justin_o: some of them have multiple settings (like size) - i guess the rest are on/off - but you\'d still have to select/toggle, wouldn\'t you?
2016-08-17T15:27:41 <danayo> thanks jessm

2016-08-17T16:52:13 <danayo> Justin_o: I just realised that the collapsing/expanding backpack focus presents a problem in the opening sequence where we want the music and voice mute buttons to be visible and clearly accessible right from the start.
2016-08-17T16:52:16 <danayo> Maybe just those two buttons could appear (without a backpack) at first, and be in the arrow key/focus order along with the languages. Then they could get added to the backpack later (starting from the rat house scene)?

2016-08-17T16:59:14 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: Hi, really sorry I was afk
2016-08-17T17:06:06 <danayo> no worries PaliwalSparsh, take a look at the fluid-work log as well, also we had a discussion about it - I\'ll put the notes into our doc
2016-08-17T17:13:22 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-08-17T18:04:27 <colinclark> danayo, sepidehshahi, et al, I keep thinking about this APCP work from the perspective of means and ends
2016-08-17T18:04:46 <colinclark> In the context of education, self-assessment *might* (I\'m not sure) be an end in itself
2016-08-17T18:05:09 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: though it was not in the doc but we discussed so i added the reset button in the ending Screen and gave ENTER as the button to trigger it. Also it is a button so can be clicked upon normally.
2016-08-17T18:05:10 <colinclark> greater learner self-awareness, support for more effective learning techniques and strategies, etc.
2016-08-17T18:06:00 <colinclark> but in the context of APCP, where we\'re building a general purpose GPII system and evaluating and testing it in the context of America\'s Job Centers and high schools/community colleges, it\'s a bit different
2016-08-17T18:06:16 <danayo> that sounds good PaliwalSparsh
2016-08-17T18:06:22 <colinclark> self-assessment or "tracking" or journalling or whatever else aren\'t an end in themselves, they\'re a means
2016-08-17T18:06:49 <colinclark> a means to support our APCP design and development team in building a GPII that best suits a very diverse range of individuals who may use it
2016-08-17T18:07:13 <colinclark> and a means to provide individuals with a voice into the evaluation process and criteria\xe2\x80\x94they know what they need best
2016-08-17T18:07:55 <colinclark> and perhaps a means to provide individuals with a more usable, more humane way to determine if their customizations with the GPII really do suit them best, and to adapt or tailor them further over time
2016-08-17T18:10:02 <danayo> that\'s interesting colinclark, and makes sense - it answers that question that I was grappling with a while back - about self-reflection in the context of APCP being either (or both) a way to evaluate GPII and a way to provide users with self-reflection
2016-08-17T18:10:08 <sepidehshahi> this is .n intersting view colinclark. I think all the points you made also apply for the education context\xe2\x80\xa6 I can see there might be specific applications for each, but it seems the base offering is similar for both contexts, more awareness about what you need and more humane way of determining that
2016-08-17T18:10:26 <danayo> but in this context the self-reflection is entirely focussed on GPII
2016-08-17T18:11:06 <colinclark> yes, i think that\'s right
2016-08-17T18:12:03 <sepidehshahi> I assumed that\xe2\x80\x99s more like a short term plan and in longer term they are also planning on including reflection on things rather than GPII
2016-08-17T18:12:32 * amatas has quit
2016-08-17T18:13:17 <sepidehshahi> If the self-reflection is just focussed on GPII, I think your thought about means and ends makes total sense colinclark
2016-08-17T18:13:53 <colinclark> this is interesting, sepidehshahi
2016-08-17T18:14:25 <colinclark> since I guess there\'s a pretty good argument to be made that you can\'t really establish the effectiveness and viability of a system like the GPII without taking a holistic approach
2016-08-17T18:14:46 <colinclark> one that takes into account the very different places, goals, and things people do
2016-08-17T18:14:54 <colinclark> do/have/are
2016-08-17T18:15:24 <danayo> +1 colinclark
2016-08-17T18:15:37 <sepidehshahi> +1
2016-08-17T18:15:39 <colinclark> especially once the GPII is something that you can carry with you
2016-08-17T18:15:55 <colinclark> so it works everywhere and smoothly into your quotidian use of ICT
2016-08-17T18:26:08 <danayo> i wonder colinclark, if that would be a good argument for implementing a self-reflection tool sooner rather than later ?
2016-08-17T18:26:33 <colinclark> how so, danayo?

2016-08-17T18:44:10 <danayo> sorry colinclark, had to find some lunch
2016-08-17T18:45:05 <danayo> i was just thinking about our self-reflection tool and how it would contribute to a more holistic approach
2016-08-17T18:47:55 * jhung joined the channel
2016-08-17T18:48:19 <danayo> which would in turn help to establish the effectiveness of GPII as you said
2016-08-17T18:52:48 <colinclark> right, that makes sense
2016-08-17T18:52:56 <colinclark> i was in the same boat, in regards to lunch :)
2016-08-17T19:00:08 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: are you there
2016-08-17T19:01:07 <danayo> hello PaliwalSparsh
2016-08-17T19:01:41 <PaliwalSparsh> From what i concluded from the doc is that, using alt takes the focus to the backpack and then user can use arrow keys LEFT and RIGHT to move through all the backpack items and use enter to select ie toggle options
2016-08-17T19:02:24 <PaliwalSparsh> again he presses alt and now again arrow keys can be used for cat movement
2016-08-17T19:02:50 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: ^
2016-08-17T19:03:36 <danayo> that\'s right PaliwalSparsh, and sorry I didn\'t finish entering the notes. In this case we need a clear way to show that focus is on the backpack vs. the game
2016-08-17T19:03:43 <danayo> so we want the backpack to collapse and expand
2016-08-17T19:04:12 <danayo> in the way we talked about some time ago - a kind of "drawer" could open from the backpack icon
2016-08-17T19:04:46 <danayo> Justin_o also had a great idea that when focus moves to the backpack, the cat could sit or lie down
2016-08-17T19:09:41 <PaliwalSparsh> thanks danayo i will try dslo
2016-08-17T19:09:59 <PaliwalSparsh> one of these
2016-08-17T19:10:13 <danayo> one issue though is that we want music and voice mute buttons to show up in opening sequence PaliwalSparsh
2016-08-17T19:10:23 <danayo> so I was thinking these could show up without a backpack at first
2016-08-17T19:10:41 <danayo> and then get added to the backpack at the point where the rathouse appears
2016-08-17T19:10:57 <danayo> does that make sense PaliwalSparsh ?
2016-08-17T19:11:39 <PaliwalSparsh> These are already added to the backpack, the cat already has a backpack with these two.
2016-08-17T19:13:04 <PaliwalSparsh> But i get the problem and solution, it makes sense.
