2016-02-10T19:19:40 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi - I\'m trying to write a short description on the self-assessment dashboard for the Floe site.
2016-02-10T19:20:11 <jhung> I came up with: "The Self Assessment Dashboard helps learners keep track of their progress, assess their accomplishments, and discover personalized learning."
2016-02-10T19:20:24 <jhung> Is that accurate?
2016-02-10T19:21:23 <danayo> that\'s sounds pretty good jhung, would be good to add self-reflection in there
2016-02-10T19:21:29 <danayo> this exerpt from the wiki: an additional element of self-reflection is required in order for a learner to determine what is working for them on an individual basis. It should also enable them to set flexible goals and customizable milestones to achieve those goals based on their needs and preferences.
2016-02-10T19:21:34 <danayo> might help?
2016-02-10T19:22:28 <jhung> ah. that\'s much better danayo. I used the word "assess their accomplishments" but self-reflection works better here. I\'ll massage it a bit and re-post it here.
2016-02-10T19:22:46 <danayo> cool, yeah
2016-02-10T19:23:14 <danayo> I think self-reflection is a good "buzzword" :)

2016-02-10T21:25:15 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi: how is this for a description of the dashboard. "The Self Assessment Dashboard helps learners keep track of their progress, and personalize their learning goals through self-reflection."
2016-02-10T21:27:43 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think we need to address the larger user group rather than just the learners?
2016-02-10T21:28:08 <danayo> for Floe we can focus on learners sepidehshahi
2016-02-10T21:28:18 <danayo> that sounds good to me jhung
2016-02-10T21:28:52 <jhung> Thanks.
2016-02-10T21:29:28 <sepidehshahi> great, thanks jhung, your definition looks good to me too
2016-02-10T21:29:55 <danayo> actually jhung, could we add - "...personalize their learning goals and learning experience through self-reflection."
2016-02-10T21:30:23 <jhung> danayo makes sense. I\'ll add that. Thanks both!
2016-02-10T21:30:26 <danayo> thanks!
