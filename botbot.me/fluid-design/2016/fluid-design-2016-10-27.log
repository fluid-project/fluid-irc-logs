2016-10-27T15:01:58 <danayo> hi jhung: i issued a couple of pull requests yesterday for the guide work
2016-10-27T15:04:08 <jhung> Ok. I'll get to them today danayo - probably this afternoon.
2016-10-27T15:04:22 <danayo> great thanks jhung

2016-10-27T19:55:54 <danayo> Justin_o: it looks like in the fixes we did yesterday I lost the changes locally that I had made in that first commit (to test-logo-update branch). So i guess I need to fetch those changes again? can i just fetch origin from that branch? or ?
2016-10-27T19:56:32 <jhung> danayo: maybe you're in a different branch?
2016-10-27T19:56:52 <jhung> danayo: check by git branch
2016-10-27T19:57:33 <danayo> yes, i am ... but i still need to fetch the last changes, don't I (into the appropriate branch) ?
2016-10-27T19:57:43 <danayo> since i don't have them locally
2016-10-27T19:59:09 <jhung> danayo: you should have it. You should get it back when you switch your branch. You're probably in your Floe-483 branch now? If you switch to your test-logo branch you should get your changes.
2016-10-27T19:59:39 <danayo> ah ok
2016-10-27T20:00:07 <jhung> As long as you've made a commit in your branches, when you switch between them you'll get those changes back.
2016-10-27T20:00:30 <danayo> great, thanks jhung
2016-10-27T20:01:05 <jhung> np. Happens to me too. There's a moment of panic thinking I lost changes until I realize I'm in the wrong branch. :D
2016-10-27T20:01:16 <danayo> yes :)
2016-10-27T20:01:37 <danayo> jhung, i made a change to a file in the current branch that i want to overwrite so i can switch branches now (I don't need to save/stash the change). do i do a hard reset?
2016-10-27T20:02:36 <jhung> If you don't want the change, you can revert that one file by doing a git checkout ./something/something/path/file.html
2016-10-27T20:03:59 <danayo> THANK YOU
2016-10-27T20:04:04 <danayo> :D
2016-10-27T20:04:06 <danayo> got it now
2016-10-27T20:04:10 <danayo> jhung
2016-10-27T20:04:10 <jhung> np. :)
2016-10-27T20:06:54 <danayo> jhung: regarding your comments in the PR, I think we still need to define hover and focus for the footer in general, so that the other links (the text links) are styled properly
2016-10-27T20:07:21 <danayo> oh wait
2016-10-27T20:07:21 <jhung> danayo: taking a closer look....
2016-10-27T20:07:32 <danayo> i see what you mean
2016-10-27T20:07:36 <danayo> it's the svgs only
2016-10-27T20:07:44 <danayo> which are the same as footer-logo-links
2016-10-27T20:08:04 <danayo> jhung ^
2016-10-27T20:10:06 <jhung> danayo: I think the other footer link styles should already be styled. What we're defining are special styles for the logos in particular. So a:hover.footer-logo-links should do the trick
2016-10-27T20:11:42 <danayo> for some reason when I change line 439 as you suggest, the svgs lose their sizing
2016-10-27T20:11:48 <danayo> jhung ^
2016-10-27T20:12:23 <jhung> really\xe2\x80\xa6 let me see...
2016-10-27T20:13:56 <danayo> jhung
2016-10-27T20:14:06 <danayo> I had a TYPO
2016-10-27T20:14:09 <danayo> I forgot the .
2016-10-27T20:14:11 <danayo> :D
2016-10-27T20:14:11 <jhung> :D
2016-10-27T20:14:40 <jhung> ugh. I just made the change, and the hover style breaks.
2016-10-27T20:15:01 <danayo> oh really? it seems ok for me!
2016-10-27T20:15:21 <danayo> I made all the changes you suggested jhung, and everything looks good
2016-10-27T20:15:55 <jhung> danayo: ok. I had only made 1 change, and not all of them. If you push up your changes I can double check for my sanity. :D
2016-10-27T20:18:43 <danayo> ok jhung
2016-10-27T20:24:50 <danayo> just pushed them jhung
2016-10-27T20:25:02 <jhung> thanks danayo. I'll take a look.
2016-10-27T20:26:52 <jhung> did you push danayo? I don't see any changes on github.
2016-10-27T20:29:44 <danayo> oh wait, something's not right jhung
2016-10-27T20:30:22 <danayo> I'm getting this jhung:
2016-10-27T20:30:22 <danayo> fatal: The current branch test-logo-update has no upstream branch.
2016-10-27T20:30:23 <danayo> To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
2016-10-27T20:30:24 <danayo> git push --set-upstream origin test-logo-update
2016-10-27T20:31:33 <jhung> what was the push command you tried to run? It should be something like: git push origin test-logo-update
2016-10-27T20:31:53 <danayo> i just did : git push origin
2016-10-27T20:31:58 <danayo> should be ok?
2016-10-27T20:32:12 <jhung> you should tell it which branch it should go into.
2016-10-27T20:32:43 <danayo> ok, done jung. jeepers. i thought it would push to the same branch i was in
2016-10-27T20:33:07 <danayo> jhung ^
2016-10-27T20:35:15 <jhung> You'd think it would figure it out\xe2\x80\xa6 but I'm glad you have to be explicit and it doesn't try to assume too much in case it's wrong.
2016-10-27T20:35:55 <danayo> good point
2016-10-27T20:37:20 <danayo> jhung I have to run now, hopefully everything looks ok, but i'll check back later
2016-10-27T20:37:30 <jhung> ok danayo thanks!
2016-10-27T20:37:39 <danayo> thank YOU jhung
