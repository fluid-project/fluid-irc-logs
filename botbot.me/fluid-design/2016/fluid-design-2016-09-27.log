2016-09-27T18:16:14 <alanharnum> jessm: could we check in quickly this afternoon (maybe 3:30ish?) about the child safe policy development? Justin_o & I spoke briefly to JT, & danayo mentioned at standup that the two of you had spoken about it yesterday
2016-09-27T18:16:24 <alanharnum> ^jhung
2016-09-27T18:16:28 <jessm> alanharnum: yes
2016-09-27T18:16:43 <alanharnum> great, thanks
2016-09-27T18:21:45 <jhung> alanharnum: sure. 3:30p works.
2016-09-27T18:22:57 <danayo> sounds good alanharnum

2016-09-27T18:49:45 <David123> jessm: yes
2016-09-27T18:52:40 <jessm> David123: ok, the above two links are the ones I think would be useful for you and Kobi to start wtih

2016-09-27T19:28:48 <danayo> jhung what do you think of the intro content/layout on the printed card? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Oc9AITFm7Q87RCm
2016-09-27T19:30:21 <jhung> Looks good danayo. Is the white on tomato read WCAG 2 compliant? I assume it is, but it looks hard to read to me.
2016-09-27T19:30:34 <alanharnum> danayo jessm jhung jobara: I\'ve got my room open on Vidyo
2016-09-27T19:30:42 <jhung> ok alanharnum
2016-09-27T19:32:58 <danayo> yeah, i\'ll double-check jhung, but i think it\'s triple-A for large text
2016-09-27T19:33:07 <danayo> be right there alanharnum
2016-09-27T20:02:03 * michelled joined the channel
2016-09-27T20:06:27 <simonjb> danayo: I\'d like to do some prep before the privacy meeting tomorrow -- are there things that would be most useful?
2016-09-27T20:06:50 <simonjb> danayo: and I left you a question on the examples doc
2016-09-27T20:07:33 <danayo> ok simonjb, thanks. michelled mentioned wanting to have a list of possible privacy preferences for DEEP - so we decided to have a brainstorm to create a list
2016-09-27T20:07:58 <danayo> i guess we want to think about the "conditions" and contexts that came up at the last meeting
2016-09-27T20:08:35 <simonjb> ok thanks danayo
2016-09-27T20:09:13 <danayo> thank you simonjb!
2016-09-27T20:37:06 <danayo> simonjb: i can\'t see your question
2016-09-27T20:37:11 <danayo> which doc is it in?

2016-09-27T21:03:32 <simonjb> sorry danayo, it was in the chat on the "Examples of misuse of personal information / private data"
2016-09-27T21:04:26 <danayo> hmmm, i can\'t seem to access the chat for some reason simonjb
2016-09-27T21:05:27 <simonjb> danayo: I was wondering if we were interesting in also listing illegal uses of personal information
2016-09-27T21:06:08 <danayo> for sure simonjb
2016-09-27T21:06:11 <simonjb> I\'m thinking of security breaches in systems that house personal information
2016-09-27T21:06:16 <simonjb> ok
2016-09-27T21:06:22 <danayo> yeah
2016-09-27T21:07:33 <simonjb> danayo: is it cool if I go ahead and add some stuff?
2016-09-27T21:07:43 <danayo> please do simonjb!
2016-09-27T21:07:46 <danayo> thanks
