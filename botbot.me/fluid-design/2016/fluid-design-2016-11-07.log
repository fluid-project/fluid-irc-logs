2016-11-07T16:51:30 <michelled1> Can you connect them with danayo a jon? I think it would be a great opportunity to get feedback and new material for the cards
2016-11-07T16:51:34 <michelled1> thanks jessm_ :)

2016-11-07T17:05:00 <colinclark> but I\'m not certain
2016-11-07T17:13:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, he mentioned that at standup, but I believe he was aiming for that to be at next weeks design crit
2016-11-07T17:13:33 <colinclark> ok cool

2016-11-07T18:51:36 <lliskovoi> There are some notes in the Illustrator file regarding the colours and typography
2016-11-07T18:52:20 <lliskovoi> Also, my apologies again for not getting back to you about the co-design session for the dashboard. Unfortunately, I\'m away on the 21st and at Metrolinx on the 28th from 8:30-12pm

2016-11-07T18:54:46 <danayo> lliskovoi ^
2016-11-07T18:55:18 <lliskovoi> thanks danayo, too bad I\'ll miss it, but  you and Allen can fill me in :)

2016-11-07T19:01:47 <danayo> colinclark: http://lorrie.cranor.org/
2016-11-07T19:02:04 <danayo> could you send me contact info for the person at carnegie mellon that you mentioned?
2016-11-07T19:02:17 <danayo> maybe I could copy them on any email I send to Lorrie?
2016-11-07T19:02:22 <colinclark> More notably, she\'s currently the Chief Technologist at the FTC!
2016-11-07T19:02:26 <michelled> danayo: can you add a link to the newest mobile designs to this page? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+User+Interface+%28Learner%29+Options+Mobile+and+Responsive+Design
2016-11-07T19:02:48 <colinclark> that\'s pretty amazing
2016-11-07T19:02:53 <danayo> oh wow colinclark, I missed that
2016-11-07T19:03:04 <colinclark> The person I mentioned was Jeff Bigham, who you might remember visiting the IDRC a few years ago
2016-11-07T19:03:12 <colinclark> but I don\'t think you need to cc him on your note
2016-11-07T19:03:28 <colinclark> this is Jeff: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/
2016-11-07T19:03:31 <danayo> ok colinclark
2016-11-07T19:03:44 <michelled> oh, I like her bio in a tweet: "Password researcher and fashion idol. Bad-ass cyberfeminist. Usable privacy & security professor. Quilter. Runs after 3 kids + soccer balls."
2016-11-07T19:03:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: the JT demo with sonification http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/john-travoltage/1.3.0-dev.7/john-travoltage_en.html?accessibility&sonification=1
2016-11-07T19:04:00 <danayo> michelled: :)
2016-11-07T19:04:10 <danayo> i imagine she\'s pretty busy these days colinclark
2016-11-07T19:04:16 <colinclark> sounds like she\'s very :)
2016-11-07T19:04:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: you can change the  sonification query parameter\'s value   to 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the different varieties
2016-11-07T19:04:38 <colinclark> Justin_o: Which sonification variety do like the best
2016-11-07T19:04:39 <colinclark> ?
2016-11-07T19:06:02 <danayo> I want to be her friend michelled!
2016-11-07T19:06:08 <michelled> me too!
2016-11-07T19:06:13 <colinclark> only one way to try :)
2016-11-07T19:06:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: trying to remember, i think it was 2.
2016-11-07T19:06:56 <Justin_o> also, the sonifications can get loud at times

2016-11-07T19:43:41 <danayo> as a way to simply (I hope) show how prefs set in UIO could then be stored in GPII, and vice versa

2016-11-07T19:55:18 <Justin_o> danayo: will you be sending the design crit e-mail or would you like me to?
2016-11-07T19:56:17 <danayo> thanks for reminder Justin_o, I\'ll send it out. Since collab room is booked, we\'ll meet in the back of IDRC area, yes?
2016-11-07T19:56:41 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, we\'ll plan to use the cart at the back
2016-11-07T19:56:47 <danayo> ok Justin_o
2016-11-07T19:56:54 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-11-07T19:58:36 <danayo> colinclark not sure if you saw this earlier - how\'s this for UIO GPII integration mockup to show MS? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/AjX2jfMbuMTnK2m - as a way to simply (I hope) show how prefs set in UIO could then be stored in GPII, and vice versa
