2016-03-14T17:44:12 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi_ that would be great. i fixed the link from the main page but that\'s it so far. thanks
2016-03-14T17:44:32 <sepidehshahi_> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix the rest
2016-03-14T18:05:09 <danayo> colinclark I added your edits re: Infusion to the google doc, but I\'m not sure you were finished. If you have a chance to take a look that would be great https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoQCNCsbTjm5-1FTv-UixLyqWrkWtJNYHEe-SA1i-6I/edit?usp=sharing
2016-03-14T18:08:49 <colinclark> danayo: will do
2016-03-14T18:08:58 <danayo> thanks
2016-03-14T18:11:09 <colinclark> sepidehshahi_: Can you suggest any images that best convey our work on "multisided platforms"?
2016-03-14T18:11:30 <colinclark> either something from P4A or one of the more general illustrations that Jutta has commissioned in the past?
2016-03-14T18:13:42 <sepidehshahi_> colinclark: as far as I remeber I have not created any diagrams or visualization for multisided platforms. I think Joanna had a few. Let me find them and send you some. Hopefully they represent what you are looking for
2016-03-14T18:14:32 <colinclark> ok, thanks!
2016-03-14T18:14:59 <colinclark> I\'m tempted to say that your early paper-based mindmap is actually pretty appropriate
2016-03-14T18:15:38 <sepidehshahi_> ok, I can send you those ones as well.
2016-03-14T18:16:21 <colinclark> I\'ll probably talk a little about Outside In and the plans, long term, for a platform that connects people with needs to service providers, indie developers/makers, provides self-directed work opportunities, etc.
