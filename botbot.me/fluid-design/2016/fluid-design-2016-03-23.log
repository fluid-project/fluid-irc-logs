2016-03-23T15:17:27 <hulkinbrain> Hello everyone!
2016-03-23T15:18:30 <hulkinbrain> i would like to contribute to the GSoC project "Implement User Interface / Learner Options Responsive Design" or "Game for First Discovery of Preferences"
2016-03-23T15:19:06 <hulkinbrain> i like front end development very much and i have created a website called ejunki.com using materializeCSS
2016-03-23T15:20:16 <hulkinbrain> i like to sketch, draw n paint very much and i can make a good storyboard type game design for the Game for Discovery Preferences project
2016-03-23T15:21:08 <hulkinbrain> Im very creative and have the thirst to learn! I would be more than happy to contribute to the above mentioned projects! :D
2016-03-23T15:24:34 <hulkinbrain> i studied the Discovery Catdesigns mockup and the first discovery tool and i got the gist of how to proceed. I am very very eager to make a contribution to these projects and i ensure i have the necessary skills to prove it to you!
2016-03-23T15:27:58 <hulkinbrain> i await guidance and i\'ll cooperate with full determination! :D
2016-03-23T15:45:58 <danayo> hi hulkinbrain, thanks for you interest and enthusiasm! please submit a formal proposal according to the guidelines you\'ll find here https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5729245854695424/

2016-03-23T15:47:15 <hulkinbrain> @danayo ok! Thankyou so much :D
2016-03-23T15:48:32 <hulkinbrain> i will submit a proposal ASAP :D
2016-03-23T15:48:49 <danayo> that\'s great hulkinbrain. if you have any questions please contact myself and Justin_o (I won\'t be online much over the next couple of days)
2016-03-23T15:50:23 <hulkinbrain> danayo could you please specify through which medium do you want me to contact you? here only or any other medium?
2016-03-23T15:50:39 <hulkinbrain> that is if i have any other queries
2016-03-23T15:51:31 <danayo> hulkinbrain: the channel (here or in fluid-work room) is best
2016-03-23T15:52:06 <hulkinbrain> danayo ok sure! thankyou so much! :D
2016-03-23T15:53:04 <danayo> :D
2016-03-23T16:01:39 <sepidehshahi> danayo: alanharnum and colinclark, this might be another intersting conference to submit our sonification paper to. It\xe2\x80\x99s deadline is the same as the other one: http://icmi.acm.org/2016/

2016-03-23T16:17:47 <hulkinbrain> danayo Justin_o i have a doubt, in the draft should i include a mock idea like for example preference for selecting a music genre or something like that?
2016-03-23T16:19:12 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain: it would be helpful if you could submit some mockups
2016-03-23T16:20:05 <hulkinbrain> Jusin_o: Ok sure! I\'ll add images for some mockup designs! :D
2016-03-23T16:20:22 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: Ok sure! I\'ll add images for some mockup designs! :D
2016-03-23T16:20:52 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain: excellent thanks, please also make sure to indicate which portions of the design mockups are your own and if you used assets from elsewhere please indicate where they came from
2016-03-23T16:20:54 <hulkinbrain> is it ok if i go with the music genre selection
2016-03-23T16:21:39 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: yeah sure, i\'ll mention the sources inside a small box near to the external element which i use
2016-03-23T16:21:49 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain:thanks
2016-03-23T16:22:16 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain: regarding the music genre selection, it\'s up to you, but you may want to try something with the example preferences provided in the project description
2016-03-23T16:22:19 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o :D my pleasure!

2016-03-23T16:27:08 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: is it ok if i do a mockup of "content preferences" from the PGA preferences categorization?
2016-03-23T16:27:57 <hulkinbrain> like a few preference types like video alts, audio alts, etc?
2016-03-23T16:28:10 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain: sure
2016-03-23T16:28:28 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: Ok! Thanks! :D
2016-03-23T16:28:39 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain: thanks, looking forward to seeing your proposal
2016-03-23T16:29:16 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: Eagerly Looking forward to working on this project! :D Cant Wait!!

2016-03-23T17:25:55 <sepidehshahi> danayo: yes, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really relevant to what we have done for sonification
2016-03-23T18:01:30 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: im making a music genre selector mockup acc to the content preference parameters in the PGA preferences, is it ok?

2016-03-23T18:21:08 <hulkinbrain> Justin_o: nevermind music genre selector wasn\'t an appropriate idea, i\'m making a mockup tool which helps the user to tailor the articles which he would read online on the basis of the choices he makes ie line spacing, text-to-speech, etc
2016-03-23T18:22:13 <hulkinbrain> Ill provide the images to help understand what im saying in the proposal
2016-03-23T18:25:10 <Justin_o> hulkinbrain: thanks
