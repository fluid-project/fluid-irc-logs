b'2016-02-22T20:09:05 <gtirloni> colinclark: avtar mentioned AeroFS.com a while ago but i can\'t remember what was bad about it (apart from not being open source)
2016-02-22T20:09:12 <colinclark> The second link, the one by Audrey Watters, raises exactly the questions I was contemplating
2016-02-22T20:09:42 <colinclark> particularly the degree to which Amazon\'s platform will encourage, require, or support the distribution of resources in Amazon\'s Kindle format
2016-02-22T20:10:19 <colinclark> as jhung knows well, Amazon is particularly against EPUB
2016-02-22T20:12:00 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-02-22T20:12:44 <colinclark> Also the quote from Mike Caufield is pretty interesting, that the approach taken by these kinds of OER platforms "assumes that learning objects are immutable single things, and that the evolution of the object once it leaves the repository is not interesting to us"
2016-02-22T20:14:49 <colinclark> it\'s an interesting point in terms of how authorabilityand adaptability--these essential techniques of inclusive design--have to be integral to the resource as much as possible, not just limited to someone\'s repository/marketplace/aggregator
2016-02-22T20:15:08 <jhung> colinclark: it sounds very much like federated wikis (fed.wiki.org).
2016-02-22T20:15:50 <colinclark> Interesting. How so, do you think, jhung?
2016-02-22T20:16:36 <jhung> colinclark: the interconnected copies and the ability to see the evolution of content over time by different authors.
2016-02-22T20:16:43 <colinclark> ah yes
2016-02-22T20:16:53 <colinclark> yep
2016-02-22T20:17:19 <colinclark> This point about how resources evolve is really important for inclusive design
2016-02-22T20:17:29 * jessm has quit
2016-02-22T20:17:32 <colinclark> since of course accessibility is often about making derivations or alternatives

2016-02-22T20:18:29 <colinclark> I guess this was what I was getting at earlier today when I was pondering the question of "packaging" as opposed to having something more "living" and dynamic that people can both use and contribute to
2016-02-22T20:20:13 <jhung> consumer expectation of digital "packaging" is changing as well. People have come to expect evolution and frequent improvement.
2016-02-22T20:20:18 <colinclark> yup, it\'s true
2016-02-22T20:20:59 <colinclark> I guess wiki platforms and even most CMSes have turned out to be challenging for this kind of thing, because of security reasons and the fact that until recently there really haven\'t been good rich text editors and that sort of thing
2016-02-22T20:20:59 <colinclark> the ILDH was always conceived as an OER itself
2016-02-22T20:21:07 <colinclark> but it\'s hard to deliver on it given the nature of the platforms
2016-02-22T20:21:33 <colinclark> so I think as we stretch ourselves to build new resources for the OER community, we\'ll want them to include their own built-in "authorability," if that makes sense
2016-02-22T20:28:03 <alanharnum> this two-parter by Caulfield is really interesting: http://hapgood.us/2016/02/15/connected-copies-part-one/ & http://hapgood.us/2016/02/17/connected-copies-part-two/
2016-02-22T20:29:29 * cindyli has quit
2016-02-22T20:30:05 <alanharnum> building on the problems he talks about with OER central sites, content-centric vs. location-centric distribution systems for information... good stuff

2016-02-22T20:33:29 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-02-22T20:40:34 <colinclark> alanharnum: This is really very interesting
2016-02-22T20:40:56 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah, it\'s an area i\'ve been curious about for a while (but don\'t know a lot about)
2016-02-22T20:41:22 <colinclark> I guess what\'s interesting, halfway through the first post, is that his computer science analogy is somewhat flawed, in my mind
2016-02-22T20:41:35 <colinclark> the "pass by copy/pass by reference" analogy
2016-02-22T20:41:53 <alanharnum> i think people who would find that analogy flawed are not the target audience :)
2016-02-22T20:41:57 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-02-22T20:42:05 <colinclark> well, there\'s more ot it than that
2016-02-22T20:42:19 <colinclark> Passing something by reference doesn\'t account for its changes over time
2016-02-22T20:42:31 <colinclark> You just have this thing "my to do list"
2016-02-22T20:42:38 <alanharnum> i think he\'s basically trying to plant the seed of thinking about the relative merits/strengths/weaknesses of different forms of information distribution in the reader
2016-02-22T20:42:50 <colinclark> and of course it\'s very powerful to have it be shareable and, more importantly, stably identifiable
2016-02-22T20:43:43 <colinclark> but what makes something like Git so interesting is the fact that _each instance of a change_ also has a stable reference
2016-02-22T20:44:08 <colinclark> so that one can account for how a resource evolves, it\'s network of references, modifications, and uses
2016-02-22T20:44:33 <alanharnum> yeah, what makes Git fascinating is the combination of "distributed" + "version control"
2016-02-22T20:44:57 <colinclark> it raises a key question also about the "granularity" of a reference
2016-02-22T20:45:09 <alanharnum> which are two concepts that don\'t have to go together conceptually at all, as can be seen from all the other systems that handle one but not both
2016-02-22T20:45:25 <colinclark> one of the things that\'s so crucial, as you\'ve undoubtedly noted when cindyli gives you some code review advice saying "add a namespace to this listener..."
2016-02-22T20:45:45 <colinclark> that global references are needed at every "point of composition" for lack of a better term
2016-02-22T20:48:29 * danayo joined the channel
2016-02-22T20:49:24 <alanharnum> git\'s metaphors are powerful enough that you can see various projects trying to solve similar problems in other spaces, like http://dat-data.com/
2016-02-22T20:51:59 <colinclark> I really like the emphasis on connection in the second blog post
2016-02-22T20:52:30 <colinclark> "And let\xe2\x80\x99s imagine that you open the cover of that book and inside the cover is the entire copy history: \'Antje H. copied this from Marcus Y. who copied it from Kin L. who copied it from Martha B. who copied it from Mike C. who copied it from Jeff B.\'"
2016-02-22T20:52:48 <alanharnum> yeah, that\'s really cool
2016-02-22T20:53:34 <alanharnum> And this: "Connected copies are copies that know things about other copies"
2016-02-22T20:54:06 <colinclark> yes
2016-02-22T20:54:20 <colinclark> this is related to what I have been writing about recently
2016-02-22T20:54:30 <colinclark> in terms of how communities can form around creative artifacts
2016-02-22T20:54:37 <alanharnum> i think that\'s a key insight - it\'s basically a far more efficient lookup system from a content-centric standpoint
2016-02-22T20:55:46 <colinclark> For me, it\'s not so much the effeciency
2016-02-22T20:56:04 <alanharnum> you have a specific (or general) thing you want - Moby Dick or a book about whales. You start from the nearest concrete instance of that and progressively traverse to what you want
2016-02-22T20:56:08 <colinclark> as what kind of interactions might spring up as a result of there being a community connected via some artifact that they use (or read or whatever)
2016-02-22T20:56:39 <alanharnum> i think there\'s similar ideas underlying library linked data, though i never really understood LLD at a sufficient level of data
2016-02-22T20:57:07 <alanharnum> yeah, from that standpoint, you can see analogues to things like social graphs
2016-02-22T20:57:56 <colinclark> I guess a social graph is a kind of mechanism
2016-02-22T20:58:03 <colinclark> but what\'s interesting is what happens in the graph
2016-02-22T20:58:18 <colinclark> i.e. people sharing ideas for new books to read or whatever
2016-02-22T20:58:29 <colinclark> by virtue of their investment in some other book
2016-02-22T20:58:52 <alanharnum> yeah the conventional social graph doesn\'t model that well currently
2016-02-22T20:59:27 <alanharnum> that\'s one of the holy grails of systems that do content recommendation, which is hugely expensive and has all kinds of problems currently
2016-02-22T21:00:04 <colinclark> yeah
2016-02-22T21:01:00 <alanharnum> "In other words, the reason I spend time talking about the networking element above is that our location-centrism is so baked into our thinking about the web that it\xe2\x80\x99s invisible to us. We think it\xe2\x80\x99s very normal to have to know whose servers something is on in order to read it. We assume it\xe2\x80\x99s good for things to be in one place and only one place, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve structured the web in a way which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make u
2016-02-22T21:01:00 <alanharnum> se of multiple locations very well."
2016-02-22T21:03:21 <alanharnum> the interesting thing for me is that content-centric protocols are enormously popular in gray/black areas of the web
2016-02-22T21:03:37 <alanharnum> the massive distribution network of content enabled by Bittorrent, etc
2016-02-22T21:03:55 <alanharnum> although Bittorrent still has the index problem to deal with, hence all the torrent index sites
2016-02-22T21:04:05 <danayo> colinclark: can\'t seem to find the blog post you\'re referring too - could you link directly?
2016-02-22T21:04:31 <alanharnum> danayo: http://hapgood.us/2016/02/15/connected-copies-part-one/
2016-02-22T21:04:31 <colinclark> sure, danayo
2016-02-22T21:04:36 <alanharnum> there\'s a second part linked from there
2016-02-22T21:04:39 <colinclark> alanharnum beat me to it
2016-02-22T21:05:12 <alanharnum> interestingly also how historically speaking Bittorrent emerges from Napster being = crushed due to being a centralized system, and thus easily targeted by legislation, shutdown, lawsuits, etc
2016-02-22T21:05:16 <danayo> thans
2016-02-22T21:05:18 <danayo> k
2016-02-22T21:06:18 <alanharnum> so the idea of distributed protocols gets that early association with black hat / illegal behaviour (the blog posts sort of allude to this), as a threat vector to centralized control, etc etc
2016-02-22T21:07:02 <danayo> colinclark, Bosmon: I\'ve never used LaTex - do you recommend I download MacTex and use that? any other tips?
2016-02-22T21:07:12 <colinclark> it\'s brutal
2016-02-22T21:07:21 <colinclark> it still terrifies me
2016-02-22T21:07:30 <danayo> LaTex, colinclark?
2016-02-22T21:07:36 <colinclark> yeah
2016-02-22T21:07:38 <danayo> eek
2016-02-22T21:07:48 <colinclark> but I think I just downloaded the Mac environment
2016-02-22T21:07:56 <colinclark> and it was pretty straightforward to build PDFs from it
2016-02-22T21:08:05 <colinclark> and then I just kind of emulate Bosmon\'s markup
2016-02-22T21:08:18 <Bosmon> It\'s not all that brutal :)
2016-02-22T21:08:19 <colinclark> the biggest thing to note, if I remember correctly, is that quotes are weird in LaTeX
2016-02-22T21:09:25 <Bosmon> I guess, apart from the fact that it can fail to format your document as a result of .... ERRORS : P
2016-02-22T21:09:29 <Bosmon> Something that Word will never do....
2016-02-22T21:10:29 <colinclark> danayo: I\'d say download MacTeX and try it
2016-02-22T21:10:36 <colinclark> and if you have any trouble I\'ll take a look at my other laptop
2016-02-22T21:10:42 <colinclark> which I think has it installed
2016-02-22T21:10:47 <colinclark> I guess I\'d better also install it here
2016-02-22T21:13:13 <danayo> ok colinclark
2016-02-22T21:13:46 <alanharnum> what are you all using the perilous and powerful LaTeX for?
2016-02-22T21:14:09 <colinclark> our paper on community design processes: https://github.com/amb26/papers/tree/master/hcii-2016
2016-02-22T21:15:01 <danayo> and I\'ll keep that in mind colinclark: "quotes are weird" :)
2016-02-22T21:15:15 <alanharnum> it has been a while since i used LaTex because I seldom have need of its powers compared to Markdown
2016-02-22T21:15:29 <alanharnum> but there really is nothing like it if you need to get something typeset just right

2016-02-22T17:52:58 <sepidehshahi> jessm: we have had this ongoing issue with dropbox space. is there any way that we could add space, or archive some of the content that is already on there to free up some space? or could we move some projects to the wiki, and remove from from drop box?
2016-02-22T17:53:32 <sepidehshahi> jhung: and danayo ^
2016-02-22T17:55:11 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I think we could delete what we don't need any longer (i.e. exported PNG files if we have the original PDF or AI file).
2016-02-22T17:55:53 <jhung> Also uploading to the wiki or our CDN could help too sepidehshahi (Justin_o can help us with getting stuff into the CDN).
2016-02-22T17:56:32 <sepidehshahi> Those are both great ideas jhung.
2016-02-22T17:58:07 <jhung> but that doesn't really solve the problem sepidehshahi since we'll eventually run out of space again. Hopefully we can come up with a home-grown solution. Justin_o and I have had conversations about this.
2016-02-22T17:58:13 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious whether those PNG files are linked to any other files e.g. presentations or webistes, and deleting them would cause missing links\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-02-22T17:59:21 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, jhung: maybe make an archive of some of the older stuff and moving to the CDN for now would be a decent holdover as we try to figure the long term solution.
2016-02-22T17:59:48 <jhung> Good point sepidehshahi - I think by default most presentation software makes its own copies of files.
2016-02-22T17:59:57 <sepidehshahi> Is it possible to use dropbox just for our current projects and anything that gets done should be moved to either Wiki or a local data storage? so in that case we can better manage space
2016-02-22T18:00:04 * alanharnum has quit
2016-02-22T18:00:11 <jhung> The real test would be to move the presentation file(s) to another location and try opening it.
2016-02-22T18:00:58 * danayo joined the channel
2016-02-22T18:01:26 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I agree. Some of the older projects can be archived.
2016-02-22T18:02:42 <colinclark> an archive makes a lot of sense
2016-02-22T18:03:12 <sepidehshahi> maybe jhung, danayo and I, and anyone else who is involved could meet sometime this week to go through our current dropbox directory and pick the projects that could be archived.
2016-02-22T18:03:14 <colinclark> avtar mentioned to me last week that he's found another cloud-based asset management system that might work for us, which provides free plans for open source communities
2016-02-22T18:03:31 <colinclark> so there might be some hope of being able to migrate off of DropBox sooner rather than later
2016-02-22T18:04:08 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s great news colinclark
2016-02-22T18:06:10 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: the design crit is happening in the fluid-standup. We are going to join separately if you are in the office

2016-02-22T19:31:14 <colinclark> yep
2016-02-22T19:31:33 <colinclark> it's something we've been talking about potentially having OCAD's central IT department offer up to researchers here
2016-02-22T19:31:41 <colinclark> though I'm not sure if it will happen
2016-02-22T19:31:51 <jhung> colinclark: would it be something we would use ourselves?
2016-02-22T19:31:58 <colinclark> yes
2016-02-22T19:32:00 <colinclark> possibly
2016-02-22T19:32:02 <colinclark> I
2016-02-22T19:32:06 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-02-22T19:32:06 <colinclark> I'm not sure it's the solution for us
2016-02-22T19:32:09 <colinclark> but it might be
2016-02-22T19:32:16 <Justin_o> the icons they have on their webpage remind me of the P4A site
2016-02-22T19:32:22 <sepidehshahi> jhung: please let me know when you have time to talk about the website
2016-02-22T19:33:04 * amatas has quit
2016-02-22T19:33:09 <jhung> colinclark: at first glance it seems to be a do-your-own dropbox replacement, but I think we would want additional features on top like versioning, tagging etc.
2016-02-22T19:33:48 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I started to look at your map of the content from the site (it's VERY good btw). I think it's pretty clear what is missing and I've started to work on getting the easy ones fixed.
2016-02-22T19:34:07 <danayo> Justin_o I love that codeology git repo visualisation so much!
2016-02-22T19:34:15 <sepidehshahi> sure, so, just let me know if I could be a help
2016-02-22T19:34:22 <sepidehshahi> jhung: ^
2016-02-22T19:34:33 * amatas joined the channel
2016-02-22T19:34:34 <jhung> Sure thing sepidehshahi.
2016-02-22T19:35:26 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I was wondering for the complete projects page - do you think it would be best to just remove the links but keep the text for the projects with broken links?
2016-02-22T19:35:34 <Justin_o> danayo: yah, they're really cool looking... i kinda wish we could use them as characters when get into making games
2016-02-22T19:35:46 <colinclark> danayo, Justin_o: woah, you're right--those visualizations are amazing!
2016-02-22T19:35:59 <danayo> SO PRETTY
2016-02-22T19:36:15 * amatas has quit
2016-02-22T19:36:18 <sepidehshahi> I think so jhung. So at least people can do a google search with that text and they may find some resources on the web.
2016-02-22T19:36:44 * amatas joined the channel
2016-02-22T19:37:00 <jhung> sepidehshahi: ok. That's an easy fix.
2016-02-22T19:37:42 <sepidehshahi> Having all projects in order also makes our job easier later on when we are redesigning the site, and we may be able to add a good link to those projects then
2016-02-22T19:37:48 <danayo> imagine them with sound Justin_o colinclark!
2016-02-22T19:39:59 <danayo> nice diagrams gtirloni, thanks for sending
2016-02-22T19:44:29 <sepidehshahi> jhung:, danayo and colinclark. In the owncloud demo, I see a versioning option and also it shows recent activities and you can favorite files or folders. It\xe2\x80\x99s not bad at all. Do you know if the space is unlimited?
2016-02-22T19:46:41 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: It's a solution that we would host ourselves, on our servers
2016-02-22T19:46:54 <colinclark> so that will depend on gtirloni :)
2016-02-22T19:47:13 <colinclark> I know that avtar had some concerns about running it, so it may not even be a solution for us
2016-02-22T19:47:15 <colinclark> but it's a possibility
2016-02-22T19:48:27 <sepidehshahi> great, we can wait to see if avtar and gtirloni approve and then maybe we could switch
2016-02-22T19:49:47 <colinclark> What is your opinion of OwnCloud, gtirloni?
2016-02-22T19:50:10 <colinclark> I know we talked about it two weeks ago with the IT folks, but I never did get your impression of it
2016-02-22T19:51:23 <gtirloni> feature-wise, i think it could fit our needs but i'd defer to you guys
2016-02-22T19:51:40 * alanharnum has quit
2016-02-22T19:51:55 <gtirloni> on the infrastructure front, my only worry is that it's not exactly a simple solution if we want to grow the space to use more than what one server can provide (but then, what is?)
2016-02-22T19:52:13 <colinclark> yeah, I guess clustering is the issue that Avtar mentioned
2016-02-22T19:52:15 <gtirloni> so if we're happy with 8TB of storage, it seems simple to deploy and support
2016-02-22T19:52:31 <colinclark> Can it run on top of Ceph in some way, gtirloni?
2016-02-22T19:52:56 <gtirloni> i think it might support Cepth but it seems they prefer GlusterFS for the storage layer
2016-02-22T19:53:44 <gtirloni> then there is clustering configuration for MySQL, etc.. my first impression is that it's up to us to figure it out
2016-02-22T19:54:20 <gtirloni> we could always start using it and worry about clustering when the time comes.. it's all built on open source components
2016-02-22T19:55:29 <gtirloni> how much are we using today with dropbox?
2016-02-22T19:56:00 <sepidehshahi> gtirloni: dropbox provides you with 2GB free space
2016-02-22T19:56:29 <sepidehshahi> for $119 annual fee, it upgrades you to 1 TB
2016-02-22T19:57:10 <gtirloni> ok, i think we won't hit the 8-9TB limit on a single server with owncloud so soon
2016-02-22T19:57:33 <gtirloni> maybe a first step would be to setup a temporary owncloud server so we can try it out and see if it has the features we need
2016-02-22T19:58:07 <gtirloni> (without worrying too much about space.. then we can do a proper deployment on a physical server)
2016-02-22T19:58:09 * danayo joined the channel
2016-02-22T19:59:24 <gtirloni> ultimately i feel we're looking for a storage solution only, right? owncloud tries to offer much more (calendar, email, etc). maybe there is something simpler out there, but i haven't researched
2016-02-22T19:59:30 <Justin_o> gtirloni, colinclark: does own cloud do versioning of the docs
2016-02-22T19:59:43 <Justin_o> i wonder how big the dropbox footprint is when you take into account all the versions
2016-02-22T20:01:13 <colinclark> Justin_o: https://doc.owncloud.org/server/7.0/user_manual/files/versioncontrol.html
2016-02-22T20:01:14 <gtirloni> looks like it does: https://doc.owncloud.org/server/7.0/user_manual/files/versioncontrol.html
2016-02-22T20:01:17 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-02-22T20:01:19 <gtirloni> ha!
2016-02-22T20:01:20 <colinclark> jinx, gtirloni
2016-02-22T20:02:01 <jessm> danayo: everyone: https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/amazon-education-to-launch-new-website-for-open-ed-resources/ Amazon is getting into education\xe2\x80\xa6
