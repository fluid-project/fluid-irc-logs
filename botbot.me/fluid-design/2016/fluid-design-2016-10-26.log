2016-10-26T15:44:16 <danayo> hi jhung, i just made a bunch of additional changes to the guide content and committed those changes before I realised I was still working in the test-logo-update branch. I haven't pushed them up yet. The related JIRA is FLOE-483, so I guess I should have created and worked in a new branch. what would you recommend i do at this point?
2016-10-26T15:44:57 <jhung> danayo: that's more of a Justin_o question.
2016-10-26T15:45:12 <jhung> It should be possible to fix that.
2016-10-26T15:49:26 <danayo> ok thanks jhung. can you help me Justin_o???  :D

2016-10-26T17:51:08 <colinclark> alanharnum and danayo: We never did settle on a time to meet yesterday... Is there a time today or tomorrow that works best for both of you?
2016-10-26T17:51:37 <alanharnum> colinclark: sometime tomorrow morning? I'm working on Infusion testing this aft.
2016-10-26T17:51:41 <colinclark> What I was thinking we'd do is spend some time looking at all the stuff we've already done related to dashboards broadly, both software and mockups, and then try to chart some incremental steps forward
2016-10-26T17:51:54 <alanharnum> I think lliskovoi was interested in attending
2016-10-26T17:52:06 <colinclark> great
2016-10-26T17:53:21 <danayo> I'm good today or tomorrow morning colinclark
2016-10-26T17:53:30 <danayo> anytime after 10am ET :)
2016-10-26T17:59:10 <colinclark> ok, lemme check my calednar
2016-10-26T17:59:38 <colinclark> 1 pm EDT, danayo, alanharnum, and lliskovoi?
