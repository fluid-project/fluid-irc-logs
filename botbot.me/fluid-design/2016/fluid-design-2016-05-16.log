2016-05-16T14:43:11 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo, I have mixed #1 & 3 concepts for the learning dashboard and tried to sketch out the detailed views for those secondary pages. https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/fjucjHz9sDuYDhQ    Neeta will also have a concept ready for today\xe2\x80\x99s design crit.

2016-05-16T14:48:56 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo, I still need to think through the interaction betweenthe dashboard and the prerferences and add it to the flow
2016-05-16T14:50:48 <danayo> cool sepidehshahi - i think that\'ll be a really interesting space - and i think we\'ll want to prioritize that interaction - even just in a very simple way
2016-05-16T14:51:05 <sepidehshahi> absolutely

2016-05-16T18:48:16 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: what do you think about doing several community meetings regarding design exercises.. there were the two that came up today after the floe meeting. Are there any others from the design cards that we would be good to try? Also there was a request for an "Introduction on Design Principles" community meeting. Perhaps we could have that
2016-05-16T18:48:16 <Justin_o> first or roll it into one of these.
2016-05-16T18:50:42 <michelled> Justin_o: I think the petals exercise is essentially that
2016-05-16T18:50:55 <Justin_o> ah cool
2016-05-16T18:52:39 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: what do you imagine \xe2\x80\x9cintroduction on Design Principles\xe2\x80\x9d could be?
2016-05-16T18:53:22 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: um.. i don\'t have anything specific in mind and don\'t remember who suggested that actually.
2016-05-16T18:53:32 <sepidehshahi> similar to what we had for intro to programming? or something more specific about a method?
2016-05-16T18:53:50 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: but i think michelled is suggesting that the petals exercise would cover it
2016-05-16T18:53:57 <danayo> Justin_o: I think getting ourselves to work through the design activities that we\'re suggesting is a good idea
2016-05-16T18:54:02 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i wasn\'t here for the programming one so not 100% sure
2016-05-16T18:54:23 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: think something general would be fine though
2016-05-16T18:54:38 <Justin_o> danayo: cool
2016-05-16T18:55:09 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: i don\'t know how many exercises there are, but i figure we could do 1 or 2 a month.. what do you think?
2016-05-16T18:55:36 <danayo> Justin_o, michelled, sepidehshahi : my understanding of the petals exercise is that it\'s much more specific
2016-05-16T18:55:45 <danayo> "design principles" sounds quite general/broad
2016-05-16T18:55:47 <sepidehshahi> I would be able to do a community meeting for general design methods not particularly inclusive design related but more general degin related things at the end of July.
2016-05-16T18:57:18 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: for flowers and petals, we have to define a design problem and then use this tool/activity to come up with a solution.
2016-05-16T18:57:32 <danayo> also Justin_o: we don\'t have a lot of the design activities fleshed out yet
2016-05-16T18:57:37 <danayo> so, that\'ll need to happen first :)
2016-05-16T18:57:50 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: July 27th okay?
2016-05-16T18:58:12 <Justin_o> danayo: ah okay... so i guess we can do them as they come, or as you\'d like to test them out maybe
2016-05-16T18:58:21 <danayo> that sounds good Justin_o
2016-05-16T18:59:35 <sepidehshahi> danayo: would you be able to meet after 3:30 today, aboutthe flowers and petals?
2016-05-16T18:59:51 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi
2016-05-16T18:59:54 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2016-05-16T18:59:54 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: cool.. so i guess let me know when you figure out the petals and the other one that you need to track Jutta down for. We have most of June and the beginning of July open right now

2016-05-16T19:30:26 <jhung> Do you have time to chat design cards site danayo?
2016-05-16T19:30:59 <danayo> i\'m about to meet with sepidehshahi to talk about the "flowers and petals" activity - can I ping you after that?
2016-05-16T19:31:30 <jhung> sure. actually can I listen in on that convo about that? I was curious bout it as well danayo sepidehshahi.
2016-05-16T19:31:34 <danayo> for sure
2016-05-16T19:31:38 <jhung> Awesome.
