2016-11-01T17:36:49 <jhung> Justin_o: I remember now why I didn\'t fix the width of the print preview. I leave it at 100% so the printer can figure out how best to fit the content.
2016-11-01T17:36:55 <jhung> Otherwise if we specify a width that seems reasonable (i.e. 10.5 inches), it may work on one printer, but not on another.
2016-11-01T17:37:07 <Justin_o> jhung: ah right
2016-11-01T17:37:09 <Justin_o> that makes sense
2016-11-01T17:37:35 <jhung> I guess there should be better instructions on how to proof using the duplex layout.
2016-11-01T17:37:43 <Justin_o> i wonder if that\'s another thing you could control by using different css for screen vs printing
2016-11-01T17:38:04 <Justin_o> hmm.. maybe
2016-11-01T17:38:30 <jhung> Justin_o: possibly, but what the user sees on screen may not be what gets printed either. So either way you have that discrepancy.
2016-11-01T17:39:36 <Justin_o> yes, that seems to be true in all cases

2016-11-01T19:59:46 <jhung> danayo: should I replace the IDRC logo in the print footer with P4A and Floe? Or leave it as is?
2016-11-01T20:01:27 <danayo> good question jhung. eventually we want to be able to customize the logo. but for now maybe let\'s leave it - we\'d have to do some re-designing to make them work in the printed footer
2016-11-01T20:01:38 <jhung> ok
2016-11-01T20:03:05 <jhung> Oh, and I was telling Justin_o eariler. There\'s a technical reason why we don\'t fix the width of the print layout danayo. If we specify a fixed width, it may print fine on one printer, but not on another. So by leaving it to flex, it allows the printer to print as wide as it can.
2016-11-01T20:06:02 <danayo> ok jhung. is there a way to separate that first preview from the actual print preview? they\'re two different things, right? I guess what I\'m wondering is can we make that initial preview look more like the final layout (i.e. have the aspect ratio closer to the actual cards) but still allow for print size adjustment?
2016-11-01T20:09:25 <danayo> maybe that doesn\'t make any sense jhung ... and i suppose we want to keep it totally flex - someone could print at a different aspect ratio if they wanted to
2016-11-01T20:09:29 <jhung> danayo: the only way to get what you see on the screen to match more closely with what is printed is to start using more fixed dimensions. This causes problems with possible differences with printable areas and scaling on different printers. The OS\'es print preview is the best way to see how it looks in the end.
2016-11-01T20:10:52 <danayo> jhung: got it. that\'s fine. you\'ve got the "use print preview" suggestion on that first page, so that will help
2016-11-01T20:11:15 <jhung> Conceivably we could add a tool in the future which previews in an 7x10 print area, but sends the output as a flexible layout so that we avoid any scaling/clipping issues.
2016-11-01T20:11:54 <jhung> The only drawback is the 7x10 preview may only be useful to get a general idea, but it may not be what the user sees when printed. But it may be closer.
2016-11-01T20:12:50 <jhung> But I agree\xe2\x80\xa6 the closer we can get to the actual print output the better danayo.
2016-11-01T20:13:35 <danayo> yeah jhung, I\'m conflicted because i do think it would be cool if we could ultimately leave it open so that someone could print them any size and shape they wanted to - not sure
2016-11-01T20:14:58 <jhung> I hope the answers to these questions become clear as the bugs get ironed out and we use it more for print danayo. :)
2016-11-01T20:15:12 <danayo> for sure jhung :)
2016-11-01T20:15:18 <jhung> btw, I updated my pull request Justin_o and danayo: https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/15
2016-11-01T20:15:38 <jhung> Fixed missing icon, repositioned the print link, and removed the version # from the footer.
2016-11-01T20:16:31 <Justin_o> alanharnum: FLUID-6008 merged
2016-11-01T20:16:40 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yay!
2016-11-01T20:16:50 <alanharnum> was that our last thing to address before resuming testing?
2016-11-01T20:16:54 <Justin_o> yep :)
2016-11-01T20:17:03 <Justin_o> alanharnum: but the build site is being rebuilt at the moment
2016-11-01T20:17:08 <Justin_o> testing should be able to start soon though

2016-11-01T20:38:07 <Justin_o> jhung: you may also want to look at this for the guides printing http://stackoverflow.com/questions/138422/landscape-printing-from-html/1392794#1392794
2016-11-01T20:38:16 <Justin_o> for the next iteration maybe
2016-11-01T20:39:38 <Justin_o> jhung: also the dotted borders only seem to be on one side, is that intentional?
2016-11-01T20:39:51 <Justin_o> only on the front
2016-11-01T20:40:46 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. Guides only on one side (this way the dotted lines don\'t have to align perfectly on both side and get cut).
2016-11-01T20:41:13 <jhung> regarding @page property Justin_o. http://caniuse.com/#search=%40page
2016-11-01T20:44:34 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, i don\'t think it\'s something that has to work everywhere, but could be useful for the cases where it does work
2016-11-01T20:45:01 <Justin_o> that is, you could still say to use landscape, but it\'s nice if it\'s set for them already
2016-11-01T20:45:16 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah.
2016-11-01T20:47:03 <Justin_o> danayo: was there anything else you wanted changes with jhung\'s guide PR or should i go ahead and merge it?
2016-11-01T20:57:26 <danayo> go for it Justin_o
2016-11-01T20:57:43 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-11-01T20:57:51 <jhung> thanks danayo and Justin_o
2016-11-01T21:02:37 <Justin_o> jhung: do i have to deploy after i merge, or is that done automatically?
2016-11-01T21:03:02 <jhung> it\'s done automatically Justin_o.
2016-11-01T21:05:26 <Justin_o> jhung: FLOE-491 merged
2016-11-01T21:06:44 <jhung> thanks Justin_o
