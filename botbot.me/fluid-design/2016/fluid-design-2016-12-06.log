2016-12-06T15:40:25 <jhung> danayo: I was looking on EFF and found this EFF researcher who deals with privacy. She may also be a good person to contact (or at least some of her articles may be useful). https://www.eff.org/about/staff/gennie-gebhart
2016-12-06T15:41:18 <jhung> Thanks to her I found Privacy Badger\xe2\x80\xa6 (I was using Ghostery previously, but trust EFF more).

2016-12-06T17:50:48 <jhung> danayo: On the wiki, I put the Child Pages tree back in. I found that\'s the only way to see the child pages now. I\'ll look into formatting it a bit better later. For now it looks bad, but at least we can see child content.

2016-12-06T20:06:36 <danayo> jhung I just installed Privacy Badger. I like their intro tutorial. I noticed that you can "deactivate Privacy Badger on this site", which made me think of Justin_o\'s point this morning about in-context adjustments and exceptions etc
2016-12-06T20:07:16 <danayo> and the badger eats cookies! :)
2016-12-06T20:07:23 <jhung> Yes danayo. I used a similar plugin in the past and being able to deactivate or whitelist sites is useful. Especially when the plugin accidentally breaks a site.
2016-12-06T20:07:33 <jhung> lol yeah. I love the name.
2016-12-06T20:07:53 <jhung> Also you don\'t mess with a badger. :)
2016-12-06T20:07:57 <danayo> no way!
2016-12-06T20:10:42 <jhung> I liked their little tutorial too. It\'s not complicated and did a good job at explaining what it does.
2016-12-06T20:10:50 <danayo> totally jhung. so clear and simple
2016-12-06T20:11:00 <danayo> and fun
