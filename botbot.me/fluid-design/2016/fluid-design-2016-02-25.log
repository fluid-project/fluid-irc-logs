2016-02-25T21:33:13 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: do you know if we could use the survey tool that was used for the DSpace Survey for any other P4A related survey?

2016-02-25T21:44:30 <colinclark> hmm, good question
2016-02-25T21:44:38 <colinclark> I have no idea what tool they used, do you?
2016-02-25T21:44:50 <colinclark> Was it Survey Monkey or some Google Forms thing?
2016-02-25T21:51:41 * michelled has quit
2016-02-25T21:59:43 <sepidehshahi> It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t survey moneky colinclark. I know that one of the SPs have created a survey tool that could be used by others. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, which SP it was though;)
2016-02-25T21:59:54 <colinclark> oh interesting
2016-02-25T21:59:59 <alanharnum> was it http://fluidsurveys.com/ maybe?
2016-02-25T22:00:02 <colinclark> I don't know anything about it
2016-02-25T22:00:09 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ll email Katerina tomorrow to find out because Survey monkey is very limited
2016-02-25T22:00:21 <alanharnum> that often gets used by researchers (especially Canadian ones) with concerns about data protection, etc
2016-02-25T22:01:07 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so alanharnum. I guess Victor\xe2\x80\x99s team in ilunion has built that tool. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you all know as soon as I find out.
2016-02-25T22:01:31 <alanharnum> it's also possible they're running their own instance of something like http://limesurvey.org/
2016-02-25T22:02:02 <colinclark> Ah, it's from Illunion
2016-02-25T22:02:03 <colinclark> interesting
