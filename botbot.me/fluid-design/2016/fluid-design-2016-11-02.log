2016-11-02T15:21:27 <jhung> Justin_o: I sent an email to Emily and CC'ing you re: remote user testing. Fill in any details I might have missed.
2016-11-02T15:21:48 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, thanks
2016-11-02T15:22:23 <jhung> try not to laugh too hard at my drawings
2016-11-02T15:23:38 <Justin_o> I thought we used a Zoom H4N for the recording
2016-11-02T15:23:41 <Justin_o> maybe that doesn't matter though
2016-11-02T15:23:55 <jhung> Was it an H4N? I thought it was a 3.
2016-11-02T15:24:13 <jhung> yeah, not like it matters really.
2016-11-02T15:27:44 <Justin_o> nice drawings jhung. I particularly like the way you've captured my hair
2016-11-02T15:28:38 <jhung> I aim to be as accurate as possible Justin_o. :D
2016-11-02T15:29:59 <Justin_o> the doc seems good

2016-11-02T15:48:39 <danayo> jhung: in Chrome I'm seeing the Print the Guide link on the far left, was that intentional?
2016-11-02T15:49:16 <jhung> looks fine for me danayo...
2016-11-02T15:49:48 <danayo> strange jhung, looks ok in Firefox for me
2016-11-02T15:50:11 <jhung> Odd. Maybe a cache issue in Chrome danayo?
2016-11-02T15:50:16 <danayo> maybe
2016-11-02T15:50:31 <danayo> yup jhung
