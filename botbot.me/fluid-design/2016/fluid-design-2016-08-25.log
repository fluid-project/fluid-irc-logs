2016-08-25T17:00:01 <danayo> sepidehshahi: any thoughts on the dimensions icon i came up with? i started with the cube (that i had on some of the first card designs), but then realised the idea of a box/container is not what we want to convey! was trying to reflect the idea of a constellation https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Iq6KYhZXVSsbHjl
2016-08-25T17:06:00 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I definitely like the connected nods more than the cube
2016-08-25T17:07:29 <sepidehshahi> I think there are two problems with the cube, first as you said it\xe2\x80\x99s a container and limited to what it contains but the nods can grow and make more connections. the other visual issue is that, there are actually 6 sides to a cube, so using a cube implies that we have 6 dimensions, danayo
2016-08-25T17:08:31 <danayo> true sepidehshahi
2016-08-25T17:08:33 <sepidehshahi> I really liked what you had proposed in your google doc as well as all the network icons you have in the illustraor file
2016-08-25T17:09:28 <sepidehshahi> particularly the one with mix of white and black nods
2016-08-25T17:09:51 <danayo> cool, thanks
2016-08-25T17:10:16 <danayo> yeah, i was also trying to show the 3 dimensions - hence the three white nodes
2016-08-25T17:10:26 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2016-08-25T17:11:45 <sepidehshahi> that works pretty well I think. and I think it should also be fine when scaled down for the print or the mobile view
2016-08-25T17:13:09 <sepidehshahi> danayo: sory I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to add my notes to the Co-Design google doc. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try my best to add them there before our Monday meeting.
2016-08-25T17:13:37 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi. i was just reading this: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/the-minecraft-generation.html?_r=0
2016-08-25T17:14:18 <sepidehshahi> this is really cool. thanks for sharing danayo

2016-08-25T21:46:34 <simonjb> hi danayo, are you on the GPII Architecture list?
2016-08-25T21:47:57 <simonjb> there was a mail today from Gregg on "Polymorphic Encryption and Pseudonymization"
2016-08-25T21:48:06 <simonjb> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2016-August/004261.html
2016-08-25T21:48:56 <simonjb> It\'s not something that I am at all familiar with but I started doing a bit of reading -- the mail links to a Google doc with a list of resources
2016-08-25T21:49:02 <simonjb> and it\'s pretty interesting
2016-08-25T21:50:02 <simonjb> it\'s a new technical (encryption) solution to limiting access to private data
2016-08-25T21:50:26 <simonjb> and might be something to at least keep an eye on for interesting conversations about privacy
