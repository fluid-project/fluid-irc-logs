2016-07-20T17:02:17 <jhung> danayo: for TJ's visit tomorrow, I can Vidyo you in on my machine. I can demo while you talk, or you can screen share your screen to me.
2016-07-20T17:02:34 <danayo> ok, great jhung
2016-07-20T17:03:44 <jhung> Awesome. I guess be ready to receive a call from me some time in the morning. I'll try to give you advanced warning danayo
2016-07-20T17:04:22 <danayo> ok thanks jhung - I'll be ready to go at 7am my time :)
2016-07-20T17:04:29 <danayo> I think probably you doing the demo would work better, so the interactions are live
2016-07-20T17:05:47 <danayo> jhung ^

2016-07-20T17:27:16 <jessm> danayo: it\xe2\x80\x99ll be super cool too to have a remote demo
2016-07-20T17:28:29 <danayo> yes jessm. I guess I could just screen-share - doesn't really matter, do you agree?
2016-07-20T17:28:49 <jessm> you certainly could do that too
2016-07-20T17:29:16 <jessm> we can be flexy and figure out which is the best method at time of with you thinking of how you\xe2\x80\x99d like to do it now
2016-07-20T17:29:49 <danayo> sure jessm. i was just thinking it might be more effective / look better to see it in-person on a local machine

2016-07-20T17:30:25 * danayo changes her mind frequently
2016-07-20T17:30:49 <jessm> if anyone/everyone wants to, we should do power poses at 8:45a EDT in prep: http://www.businessinsider.com/power-pose-2013-5?op=1
2016-07-20T17:30:55 <jessm> danayo: ^ it will calm the mind
2016-07-20T17:31:37 <danayo> hilarious jessm
2016-07-20T17:31:49 <jessm> science danayo :P
2016-07-20T17:32:29 <danayo> like swans jessm!
2016-07-20T17:34:40 <danayo> it's all about status jessm: http://improwiki.com/en/wiki/improv/status

2016-07-20T18:38:56 <jhung> If you look at line 427 danayo you'll see that .docs-template-category-active is already defined. So rather than define it again, you can use what is already there.
2016-07-20T18:38:57 * sepidehshahi_ is now known as sepidehshahi
2016-07-20T18:39:59 <danayo> jhung, .docs-template-topics-active { allowed me to style the sidebar only (without styling the tabs)
2016-07-20T18:40:08 <jhung> So move the line where you define the left-border up so it's enclosed by the .docs-template-category-active declaration that's already there.
2016-07-20T18:40:22 <jhung> Oh
2016-07-20T18:40:26 <danayo> that causes it to style both the sidebar item and the tab, jhung (that's what was there before)
2016-07-20T18:40:27 <jhung> sheesh. Sorry danayo
2016-07-20T18:40:32 <danayo> no worries!
2016-07-20T18:40:38 <jhung> long day :P
2016-07-20T18:40:52 <danayo> :)
2016-07-20T18:41:04 <jhung> Yeah what you have there looks fine. Let me check it out now just to make sure it looks right
2016-07-20T18:41:15 <danayo> ok thanks
