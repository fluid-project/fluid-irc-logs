b'2016-04-05T17:38:46 <Justin_o> do you see a "project x" collection
2016-04-05T17:38:58 <danayo> yes
2016-04-05T17:39:05 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-05T17:39:05 <Justin_o> cool that\'s the one i created
2016-04-05T17:39:27 <danayo> so, we all have to log in to same url, yes?
2016-04-05T17:39:34 <Justin_o> danayo: yes
2016-04-05T17:39:48 <Justin_o> so this is the entire system, as opposed to separate accounts on the same system
2016-04-05T17:41:03 <danayo> yeah...it\'s kind of weird. when I go to add you as an attached user, it pulls up your name, but then adds "admin" to the list - kinda confusing
2016-04-05T17:41:25 <Justin_o> sepideh you can log into my instance http://idrc_justin.trial.resourcespace.org with username: sepideh and password: passw0rd
2016-04-05T17:44:01 <danayo> sepidehshahi: design cards are not all posted on gpii wiki, right, just one sample of each category?
2016-04-05T17:45:13 <sepidehshahi> danayo: they are. The last sentence in each category includes a link to the PDF for all of the cards in that category
2016-04-05T17:45:52 <danayo> ah, thanks
2016-04-05T17:46:10 <sepidehshahi> np
2016-04-05T17:47:50 <danayo> and sepidehshahi is the prosperity for all logo on the wiki somewhere?
2016-04-05T17:48:41 <sepidehshahi> let me see danayo
2016-04-05T17:50:24 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can find the logo on the GPII wiki. However, you can copy it from the powerpoint template: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=cmFpc2luZ3RoZWZsb29yLm9yZ3xwNGFtYW5hZ2V8Z3g6MTk4NzRkNjdhNWU5MzFlZA
2016-04-05T17:53:20 <danayo> perfect, thanks sepidehshahi
2016-04-05T18:00:44 <danayo> sepidehshahi: the virtuous cycles diagram is not in the dropbox folder with the pdfs, so it\'s not loading. could you please add it or send to me?

2016-04-05T18:22:51 <danayo> thanks sepideh, how do you sync them?
2016-04-05T18:29:51 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2016-04-05T18:31:20 <sepidehshahi> danayo untill we have more space, any new file that I am adding to the drop box will be saved on my local drive and won\xe2\x80\x99t sync
2016-04-05T18:31:41 <sepidehshahi> as soon as e have more space they will sync up automatically
2016-04-05T18:32:39 <danayo> ah, but the image file was there in a subfolder in dropbox
2016-04-05T18:33:01 <danayo> but perhaps that\'s not the one you used, sepidehshahi ?
2016-04-05T18:33:16 <sepidehshahi> perhaps danayo

2016-04-05T14:15:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, that seems like a good place to start

2016-04-05T14:29:25 <danayo> thx
2016-04-05T14:29:32 <danayo> I\'ll add that to the wiki page alanharnum
2016-04-05T14:29:38 <danayo> someone was asking
2016-04-05T14:29:41 <sepidehshahi> yes, 45-60 minutes
2016-04-05T14:29:46 <danayo> great, thanks
2016-04-05T14:37:17 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung, sepidehshahi: are you intersted in trying out ResourceSpace. It\'s the digital asset management system I mentioned at the design crit yesterday. They offer a free trial that we could test out http://www.resourcespace.org/trial and if that looks promising we should be able to host our own instance of it.
2016-04-05T14:37:39 <danayo> ah, thanks Justin_o, I was trying to remember the name of it
2016-04-05T14:39:14 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-04-05T14:43:51 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'m hoping it\'ll be good.. it looks like it\'s open source too. http://svn.resourcespace.org/svn/rs/trunk/documentation/licenses/resourcespace.txt
2016-04-05T14:44:34 <danayo> jhung: for disabled buttons and keyboard accessiblity, do we usually just take the button out of focus order? I found something on webAIM that recommends an aria-disabled label
2016-04-05T14:45:10 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-05T14:45:26 <danayo> also Justin_o ^
2016-04-05T14:45:46 <danayo> and Justin_o: that\'s great that it\'s open source, I\'ll try it out
2016-04-05T14:46:03 <Justin_o> thanks danayo
2016-04-05T14:46:43 <jhung> danayo: you can use aria-disabled and disabled="true"
2016-04-05T14:47:13 <jhung> aria-disabled is used for situations where things are not typically disabled like links, blocks of interactive text etc.
2016-04-05T14:47:37 <danayo> ok, thanks jhung. so it remains in the focus order, but is announced as disabled, yes?
2016-04-05T14:48:44 <jhung> if using strictly aria-disabled it will depend on the AT to implement how it\'s handled danayo. Most ATs will announce that it\'s disabled.
2016-04-05T14:49:11 <Justin_o> danayo: i don\'t think buttons that are disabled are focusable, so it may make sense to take them out... but for screen readers they can access things outside of normal keyboard navigation so it does make sense to indicate that they are disabled.
2016-04-05T14:49:12 <jhung> whether or not it\'s still in the tab order I\'m not sure. Justin_o any idea?
2016-04-05T14:49:25 <danayo> ah
2016-04-05T14:49:49 <jhung> danayo: Justin_o brings up a good point. For buttons you use disabled="true". for everything else you would use aria-disabled.
2016-04-05T14:49:57 <danayo> I see
2016-04-05T14:49:57 <danayo> ok
2016-04-05T14:50:03 <jhung> sorry for the confusion.
2016-04-05T14:50:33 <danayo> so the button would be skipped in tab focus order, but screenreader may be able to access it in some way that indicates it\'s disabled, is that right?
2016-04-05T14:50:40 <danayo> jhung Justin_o ^
2016-04-05T14:50:52 <danayo> with disabled=true
2016-04-05T14:50:58 <jhung> yes danayo.
2016-04-05T14:51:05 <danayo> thanks!
2016-04-05T14:51:19 <jhung> np
2016-04-05T14:51:23 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, i believe so... and to be clear in this case it is a link and not a button, i was just using buttons as an example to compare with
2016-04-05T14:51:33 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-04-05T14:51:51 <danayo> but it actually behaves like a button, no?
2016-04-05T14:51:55 <Justin_o> so here we\'d have to use aria-disabled as opposed to setting the disabled property
2016-04-05T14:51:58 <danayo> or maybe not
2016-04-05T14:52:01 <danayo> hmmmm
2016-04-05T14:52:44 <danayo> jhung we\'re referring to the "previous" and "next" links on the pager
2016-04-05T14:52:52 <danayo> component
2016-04-05T14:53:14 <Justin_o> danayo: hmm... i\'m not sure actually.. it does jump to a different page in the pagination but it changes depending on which page you are on, so i guess it could be either
2016-04-05T14:53:32 <jhung> I would think it\'s more a link than button since the prev/next actually navigates.
2016-04-05T14:55:37 <jhung> alanharnum, danayo: do we have a GPII logo anywhere?
2016-04-05T14:57:17 <danayo> Thanks jhung, that makes sense. I had to look up the difference!
2016-04-05T14:57:31 <danayo> I found this: Actions where users affect the website itself is where you use a button. For example, sign-up and purchase actions are often buttons. Creating new posts or making comments are actions that change a website\xe2\x80\x99s content and what the user sees. Actions where users won\xe2\x80\x99t affect the website are where you use a link. These are actions that take users from one page to another without changing anything on the website\xe2\x80\x99s back
2016-04-05T14:57:31 <danayo> front-end.
2016-04-05T14:58:37 <danayo> so in that case, we\'d use aria-disabled property, and they would remain in the focus order, is that right jhung Justin_o?
2016-04-05T14:59:12 <danayo> jhung: not sure we have a GPII logo, let me check. sepidehshahi, do you know?
2016-04-05T15:00:05 <jhung> danayo: yep. aria-disabled will work for those links.
2016-04-05T15:00:52 <sepidehshahi> danayo: , I have not seen GPII logo in our files.
2016-04-05T15:01:16 <sepidehshahi> Nadia was using it in her DSpace mockups, so I think I can find it there and send it to you danayo
2016-04-05T15:01:37 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: i don\'t know if there is a rule or convention about removing disabled links from the tab order or not
2016-04-05T15:01:44 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo I have one from a mockup but it\'s small.
2016-04-05T15:03:07 <jhung> Justin_o, danayo: in situations like this I refer to WCAG (re: The understandable and operable principles). Is it confusing to remove a link from the tab order or is it better to keep it there, but make it inoperable?
2016-04-05T15:04:00 <Justin_o> jhung: maybe we should ping lisa on it to see if there is a best practice she knows of
2016-04-05T15:04:44 <sepidehshahi> danayo: give me a few min, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you an Ai version
2016-04-05T15:06:01 <jhung> thanks sepidehshahi!
2016-04-05T15:07:27 <danayo> jhung Justin_o: My sense is that it would be better to keep a disabled link in the tab order, but it would be good to ask lisa what she thinks
2016-04-05T15:08:21 <jhung> danayo: that\'s my thinking as well.  I find there\'s no "rule of thumb" in cases like this which is why web a11y can be a frustrating beast to many.
2016-04-05T15:09:15 <danayo> yeah jhung, I just want ANSWERS!! :)

2016-04-05T15:11:10 <danayo> hi lliskovoi, jhung, Justin_o and I were just debating whether or not it\'s best to keep a disabled link in the tab order (focusable)
2016-04-05T15:11:37 <danayo> and wondered what you thought?
2016-04-05T15:11:51 * jhung1 joined the channel
2016-04-05T15:11:52 * jhung has quit
2016-04-05T15:11:59 <lliskovoi> I agree with Justin, aria-disabled is probably your best call in this case
2016-04-05T15:12:19 <danayo> yes, definitely aria-disabled, but should the link remain focusable?
2016-04-05T15:12:28 <danayo> lliskovoi ^
2016-04-05T15:13:20 <lliskovoi> Could you describe the context?
2016-04-05T15:14:08 <jhung> brb having issues. rebooting my machine.
2016-04-05T15:15:37 <danayo> lliskovoi: previous and next links for page control here http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/pager/
2016-04-05T15:16:34 * jhung joined the channel
2016-04-05T15:16:41 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: there\'s a pull request under review right now that greys out the previous and next links when you are on the first and last page respectively.
2016-04-05T15:17:58 <lliskovoi> so would these links be repeated on multiple pages, and in some cases they will be disabled, like first and last page?
2016-04-05T15:20:57 <danayo> that\'s right lliskovoi, prev will be disabled on first page, and next will be disabled when on last page
2016-04-05T15:22:07 <lliskovoi> I think you can do it either way, but I would probably lean towards keeping it in the focus order for the sake of consistency.
2016-04-05T15:25:16 <danayo> thanks lliskovoi, that was my thinking also
2016-04-05T15:26:38 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I have shared the GPII logo on Skype

The url I chose was idrc_dana, wasn\'t sure if we\'re all supposed to create/join the same one?
2016-04-05T17:23:03 <Justin_o> danayo: what organization did you put?
2016-04-05T17:23:12 <danayo> IDRC
2016-04-05T17:24:10 <Justin_o> looks like we can\'t reuse the URL, but i\'ll follow your structure
2016-04-05T17:24:56 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I created my account with url: idrc_sepideh
2016-04-05T17:25:51 <jhung> danayo: thanks. I\'ll check it out later.
2016-04-05T17:25:53 <danayo> ok great
2016-04-05T17:29:37 <danayo> hmmm, having trouble figuring out how to share files with other users sepidehshahi, Justin_o, if you figure it out let me know!
2016-04-05T17:29:59 <Justin_o> i\'m trying to upload something now danayo
2016-04-05T17:31:28 <sepidehshahi> danayo: the annual fee is very high for this service. Is this going to be free for us? did I miss something in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s community meeting Justin_o?
2016-04-05T17:31:42 <sepidehshahi> I mean design crit:)
2016-04-05T17:31:49 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: we\'d host it ourselves
2016-04-05T17:32:02 <sepidehshahi> oh, ok.
2016-04-05T17:32:17 <Justin_o> and probably have no support
2016-04-05T17:33:08 <Justin_o> danayo: so i think the reason why you can\'t share is that we are the admins of our free trial... and you can go to "Manage Users" under the Admin tab to add new users to your trial
2016-04-05T17:35:12 <danayo> I tried that Justin_o
2016-04-05T17:35:35 <danayo> but when I add text in the text field, it\'s not puling up any existing users
2016-04-05T17:35:49 <danayo> so, I\'d have to know your user name exactly?
2016-04-05T17:36:02 <Justin_o> danayo: try logging into mine http://idrc_justin.trial.resourcespace.org
2016-04-05T17:36:03 <danayo> (It just adds exactly what I type to the list)
2016-04-05T17:36:11 <Justin_o> use username: dana and password: passw0rd
2016-04-05T17:37:36 <danayo> ok
