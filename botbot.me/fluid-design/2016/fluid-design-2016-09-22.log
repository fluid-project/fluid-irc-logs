2016-09-22T15:34:29 <danayo> ok Jess_
2016-09-22T15:48:41 <jhung> danayo: if you scroll down you will see the posters regarding privacy and security.

2016-09-22T15:49:40 <danayo> thanks jhung :)
2016-09-22T15:52:18 <colinclark> I miss the one of the person in a bellaclava, jhung
2016-09-22T15:52:22 <colinclark> that one was very cool
2016-09-22T15:52:24 <colinclark> and spooky
2016-09-22T15:53:14 <jhung> I think that one is still hanging up in the hallway at the office colinclark.
2016-09-22T15:53:20 <colinclark> :)
2016-09-22T15:54:25 <jhung> danayo: I kinda like the toothbrush one. It doesn't come across as fear-mongering.
2016-09-22T16:02:28 <danayo> ooh the bellaclava sounds good - don't think i've seen that one colinclark jhung

2016-09-22T17:59:18 <jessm> fluid-everyone: it\xe2\x80\x99s that time of year again to change your OCAD passwd. don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, after you change it you mysteriously need to login to webmail at outlook.ocad.ca to have it work\xe2\x80\xa6 #memories
2016-09-22T18:00:01 <cindyli> thanks, jessm
2016-09-22T18:00:50 <clown> jessm, I tallked a bit about it at standup, but having to login to webmail is a new one.  What I discovered was that the ocadu and eduroam wifi passwords automagically change when you change your main password.
2016-09-22T18:02:10 <jessm> clown: interesting
2016-09-22T18:03:01 <jessm> i actually had no idea where/how to change my password until i got Alastair\xe2\x80\x99s email this morning
2016-09-22T18:03:12 <jessm> then i changed it and was baffled until i remembered the webmail trick
2016-09-22T18:38:44 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: i'm thinking of printing off a copy of the design cards to use with the co-op students for next week.
2016-09-22T18:39:04 <Justin_o> is the updated version ready to go, and how do i get the correct pdf files?
2016-09-22T18:42:23 <jhung> danayo: am I right in saying that the web version is the most up to date? We don't have a print-ready version with the updates just yet. Justin_o I can look into getting a PDF to you, but it won't look like the printed cards - it'll just be a PDF of all the content. Would that be okay?
2016-09-22T18:42:40 <Justin_o> :(
2016-09-22T18:42:50 <Justin_o> jhung: i don't know.. i was going to keep them around the office for use later
2016-09-22T18:43:37 <danayo> Justin_o, jhung - i think it would be ok to print the version we have in the existing pdfs, they just won't be totally up to date, but you could also show them the online version
2016-09-22T18:43:56 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo, lliskovoi: would you be available on thursday afternoon to lead an exercise with the design cards for the co-op students.. i'm thinking it will be a useful introduction for them
2016-09-22T18:46:14 <jhung> Justin_o: then maybe use the older copy for now until we have a solution for printing PDFs from the source files?
2016-09-22T18:46:25 * Yan_Hu1 has quit
2016-09-22T18:46:43 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: coincidentally word just came through that we are not to print off the old versions anymore
2016-09-22T18:47:11 <danayo> word from above Justin_o? :)
2016-09-22T18:47:34 <Justin_o> danayo: do you know if all of the requested updates and restructuring have gone into the website already, or is there more that still needs to be done?
2016-09-22T18:47:43 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, from above :)
2016-09-22T18:48:26 <danayo> not all of them Justin_o - but I can prioritise this to get them in - there's not a a lot of work there
2016-09-22T18:49:55 <Justin_o> danayo: it's probably lower priority in terms the co-op students, but seems others were talking about them too, so no sure what the priority is for that.. maybe jessm would know..
2016-09-22T18:50:29 <Justin_o> i have a feeling though that it would be good to be in a state where we can print on short notice, but don't know of anything on the horizon
2016-09-22T18:51:45 <danayo> yeah Justin_o, jhung - I guess the question is - is it worth putting in the time to create static pdfs that are up-to-date (i.e. I would update the existing files to match the online content), or should we just focus on getting the print functionality happening?
2016-09-22T18:52:33 <jhung> Justin_o: that's the issue I've been looking at. There are a couple issues which are non-trivial issues to solve.
2016-09-22T18:54:13 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have those written up anywhere? like JIRA or the wiki?
2016-09-22T18:55:11 <jhung> Justin_o: I started to document it on the wiki but it's incomplete. I'll finish that up and we should talk about it.
2016-09-22T18:55:57 <Justin_o> jhung: sounds good
2016-09-22T18:57:46 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: by the way, jessm has found a print copy for me to use with the co-op students.
2016-09-22T18:57:58 <Justin_o> still probably good to get us into a state where we can print the latest and greatest though
2016-09-22T19:00:41 <danayo> ok Justin_o
2016-09-22T19:05:47 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-22T19:05:47 <jhung> Justin_o, danayo - here's a summary of the issues. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Online+Documentation+for+Print+Output+Issues+and+Challenges
2016-09-22T19:06:05 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-22T19:06:10 <jhung> The 2 challenging problems are: getting 2 cards per page, and the duplex order on the reverse side.
2016-09-22T19:11:14 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-22T19:28:20 <michelled> danayo, jhung: Justin_o made the good point that we probably should be in a state where we can print up the updated cards before DEEP. of course, we also have a slew of privacy work to do before DEEP. I'm not sure how we should prioritize this, but it feels to me, danayo and you probably need to focus on privacy before cards
2016-09-22T19:29:16 <danayo> michelled: do you think it would make sense for volunteers to work on updating the existing printable pdfs?
2016-09-22T19:29:16 <jhung> michelled: I  haven't been involved w Privacy work so far, is that coming for me?
2016-09-22T19:29:22 <michelled> sounds to me like it's unlikely that we will be able to print from the site before DEEP, so we should get the pdf updated. danayo if you need help with that maybe we could ask one of our volunteers
2016-09-22T19:29:50 <michelled> jhung: no, just peripherally - like at crits and the like
2016-09-22T19:30:38 <michelled> danayo: yes, that makes sense to me.
2016-09-22T19:31:07 <michelled> danayo: are you in contact with Mel or Deep? or were you thinking of the students that are starting next week?
2016-09-22T19:34:07 <danayo> michelled: i was thinking of mel or deep
2016-09-22T19:34:16 <danayo> i don't have contact for Deep
2016-09-22T19:35:00 <michelled> jhung: is Mel doing PhET work with you?
2016-09-22T19:35:48 <michelled> I think Deep is busy with a task at the moment, perhaps we could start with Mel?
2016-09-22T19:36:17 <jhung> michelled: she was interested in it, but we haven't formally sync'ed up. I believe she's going to be out of the country?
2016-09-22T19:36:21 <jhung> But available on skype
2016-09-22T19:37:27 <michelled> jhung: could you ping her when you get a chance and see if she's got the cycles to update the pdf?
2016-09-22T19:51:39 <jhung> michelled: sure. Once we have a time to chat, would you like to join danayo?
2016-09-22T19:52:39 <michelled> DEEP is in two weeks, so if she can't do it, we need to find someone else
2016-09-22T19:56:54 <alanharnum> michelled: DEEP is Oct 13/14, so there's about three weeks left, if that helps
2016-09-22T19:57:07 <michelled> it does :)
2016-09-22T19:57:07 <alanharnum> or changes urgency, etc
2016-09-22T19:59:09 <danayo> jhung: yes, for sure, thanks
