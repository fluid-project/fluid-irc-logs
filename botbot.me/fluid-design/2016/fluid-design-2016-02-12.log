2016-02-12T15:57:59 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: I had a look through the Chart Authoring page. It looks great. Thanks for putting it together
2016-02-12T16:00:16 <alanharnum> thanks sepidehshahi - one thing I worry about a little is it might be underdetailed on the design side. I also realize I don't know exactly when the IDRC began working on sonification - maybe colinclark or danayo has a better sense of that?
2016-02-12T16:02:55 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum I think you had a brief description of how we came up with the sketches and you had provided links to our sonification sketches page, which I think was good. I can add a little bit more detail there if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. And as for the start date, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, I think it was some time before the sprint.
2016-02-12T16:04:58 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: if you feel OK about it I'm ok with it :)
2016-02-12T16:05:12 <sepidehshahi> Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll add details there today
2016-02-12T16:05:36 <alanharnum> i mostly want to be sure it's not giving short shrift to the design side
