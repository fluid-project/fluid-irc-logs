2016-03-31T15:53:33 <danayo> colinclark do you have a higher res version of the community meeting doodle ? It\'s hard to read some of the detail
2016-03-31T15:53:47 <colinclark> danayo: Yes, it\'s also a bit blurry
2016-03-31T15:53:52 <colinclark> This was taken with my fancy new phone
2016-03-31T15:53:55 <danayo> :)
2016-03-31T15:54:05 <colinclark> with this "live picture" thing, which I don\'t really know what it is
2016-03-31T15:54:16 <colinclark> so I\'m hoping maybe there is a slightly less blurry version in there somewhere
2016-03-31T15:54:18 <colinclark> let me take a look
2016-03-31T15:54:23 <danayo> thanks.
2016-03-31T15:54:25 <colinclark> I definitely have many more megapixels I can send you

2016-03-31T15:54:46 <danayo> it\'s somewhat fancy :)
2016-03-31T15:54:52 <danayo> do you have a 6?
2016-03-31T15:55:58 <danayo> colinclark sepidehshahi alanharnum when were you thinking of meeting today re: sonification paper ?
2016-03-31T15:56:37 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meeting in the afternoon, so I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with anytime that works for others.
2016-03-31T15:56:49 <alanharnum> maybe 3 EST? it doesn\'t have to be a long meeting - i think we basically just need to decide on a recruitment strategy now that we\'re REB approved
2016-03-31T15:57:03 <colinclark> I could do 3
2016-03-31T15:57:22 <colinclark> danayo: I have a 6s
2016-03-31T15:59:58 <danayo> 3 is fine with me colinclark sepidehshahi alanharnum
2016-03-31T16:00:32 <sepidehshahi> works for me as well
2016-03-31T16:04:02 <danayo> colinclark sepidehshahi do you want to meet about next week\'s community meeting today? sooner would be better than later for  me (before 3) or we could wait until monday?
2016-03-31T16:04:22 <colinclark> I am booked pretty close to solid today
2016-03-31T16:04:28 <colinclark> but I could meet after our 3 pm meeting

2016-03-31T17:48:31 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I may not get around to starting it today, so if you have some time to help that would be great!
2016-03-31T17:49:55 <sepidehshahi> absolutely jhung. Is there anything specific that I could work on today? or should we talk sometime tomorrow to start planning?
