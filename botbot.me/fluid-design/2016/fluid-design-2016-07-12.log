2016-07-12T15:47:15 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I\'ve added the entry to sonification. You can preview the changes here https://jhung.github.io/docs-inclusive-learning/Sonification.html
2016-07-12T15:47:20 <jessm> mentioned Quantization podcast at standup \xe2\x80\x94 they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the website up yet but here is the link to their first episode! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll post to the Inclusive Design Community List when it\xe2\x80\x99s up https://soundcloud.com/user-598215464/episode01-inclusive-education/s-f1Lv0
2016-07-12T15:47:37 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot jhung
2016-07-12T15:47:51 <jhung> Note: the navigation doesn\'t quite work on gh-pages, but the content is there sepidehshahi

2016-07-12T17:06:10 <jhung> yes danayo
2016-07-12T17:33:49 <danayo> hi jhung, this may seem like a minor point, but I really think that "The Inclusive Design Guide" works better than "Inclusive Design Guides". If you\'re ok with that, I\'ll make the changes.
2016-07-12T17:34:15 <jhung> Oh, I thought we decided on plural danayo?
2016-07-12T17:34:46 <danayo> not that I understood, jhung
2016-07-12T17:34:49 <jhung> Yeah if you can make those changes that would be great.

2016-07-12T18:28:49 <jhung> They have an accessibility-focused research and development subgroup, lead by Mark Hakkinen. I\'ll be meeting them today via PhET.
2016-07-12T18:29:16 <jessm> jhung: not that i know of
2016-07-12T18:29:36 <jessm> though i imagine they have connections to many people we work with in education
2016-07-12T18:30:27 <jhung> yeah. I wouldn\'t be surprised jessm. I\'ll let you know if anything interesting comes from the meeting.
2016-07-12T18:30:42 <jessm> they are the big test administers i believe
2016-07-12T18:30:45 <jessm> at least they were
2016-07-12T18:31:12 <jessm> oh, yeah, they still are
2016-07-12T18:31:18 <jessm> https://www.ets.org/about/fast_facts
2016-07-12T18:31:48 <jhung> Funny\xe2\x80\xa6 I think they\'re using the same stock photo on their website that Lumen has used in their assessments. :)
2016-07-12T18:32:01 <jessm> oh that is funny
2016-07-12T18:32:12 <jessm> jhung: i\xe2\x80\x99ve taken at least 3 of their tests\xe2\x80\xa6 sigh

2016-07-12T18:34:29 <jessm> jhung: \xe2\x80\x9cThe most popular of the College Board\'s tests is the SAT, taken by more than 3 million students annually. \xe2\x80\x9c
2016-07-12T18:36:15 <jhung> jessm: Fun fact. In high school I went to school not knowing it was SAT day. I hadn\'t studied at all. :D
2016-07-12T18:36:32 <jhung> btw, this was on their wiki page. Not sure what it means, but it sounds interesting: "development of methods for detecting test unfairness, including invention of the Standardization approach to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_item_functioning (DIF) and application of the Mantel-Haenszel method;"
2016-07-12T18:43:44 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-07-12T19:22:42 <danayo> jhung, just pushed my changes. also gave the figure on homepage a min width because it looked a bit strange when it got really small, but couldn\'t figure out how to get it to jump to one column sooner (i.e. at a larger width) so that the image appears below the text. not a big priority
2016-07-12T19:24:56 <michelled> danayo: are the most recent dashboard designs on the wiki?
2016-07-12T19:28:10 <danayo> no michelled, i guess they are not :9
2016-07-12T19:28:13 <danayo> :(
2016-07-12T19:28:41 <danayo> i can add them
2016-07-12T19:32:24 <michelled> cool, thx danayo

2016-07-12T20:18:05 <danayo> jhung, the sonification page looks good to me. noticed one typo in this sentence in the Floe Work section (the word data appears twice): The Floe chart authoring tool is a multimodal authoring tool that produces three forms of content from user-entered data data
2016-07-12T20:19:20 * clown_mtg has quit
2016-07-12T20:20:32 <danayo> also jhung, in the last point under Exploring Sonification and Emerging Best Practices, I would replace "users will need the ability to custommize ..." with "users will need to be able to customize  ..." or "users will need to have the ability to customize  ..."
2016-07-12T20:29:39 <danayo> sepidehshahi: michelled was asking if we had the latest dashboard designs on the wiki. i was going to add them to our wiki page, and was thinking that it would probably be best to create a new page that shows a few snapshots and also has a full pdf. what do you think? I\'m happy to do it - should I use MyL3_VD_2 ?
2016-07-12T20:32:27 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot danayo. please let me see which version is the latest. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a link to the PDF as well as a link to the latest prototype so they can be both included on the wiki page.
2016-07-12T20:32:38 <danayo> perfect sepidehshahi
2016-07-12T20:32:52 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-07-12T20:36:31 <sepidehshahi> Here is the link for the latest visual design, although there have been some changes since we started building the prototype that are not reflected in this document, danayo. e.g. the fileds for manual data entry: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Bi8N8rPPBA18WGw
2016-07-12T20:37:28 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi, I think that\'s ok. we can always update later
2016-07-12T20:37:44 <sepidehshahi> and here is the link to the latest prototype: http://share.framerjs.com/rt3h4cf95d3u/
2016-07-12T20:38:42 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I wish we could somehow couple the usecase with the prototype. So, maybe in the wiki page first we have the usecase and then include a link for the prototype
2016-07-12T20:39:49 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ll add the June 10th prototype to the wiki page as soon as it\xe2\x80\x99s ready
2016-07-12T20:42:04 <danayo> that\'s a good idea sepidehshahi
2016-07-12T20:42:08 <sepidehshahi> sorry danayo, please use this link for th eprototype: http://share.framerjs.com/359nmgqknlkj/
2016-07-12T20:42:12 <danayo> ok
2016-07-12T20:42:17 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot:)
