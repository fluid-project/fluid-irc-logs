2016-10-03T13:36:02 <Justin_o> jhung: at tomorrows design crit i\'d like for us to discuss how to handle placeholder text and disabled elements (e.g. buttons, fields, etc) in our designs. Specifically in relation to supporting WCAG\'s contrast guidelines for our demos and sites.
2016-10-03T13:37:51 <jhung> Sure Justin_o. lliskovoi it\'d be good to have your thoughts on this if you\'re available to attend. Examples would be helpful.
2016-10-03T13:39:56 <lliskovoi> jhung: yep, I\'ll be at the crit tomorrow, I\'ll have a look around to see if I can find good examples
2016-10-03T13:41:14 <jhung> lliskovoi: awesome. Thanks!

2016-10-03T17:59:39 <Jess_> jhung: i have to miss pressbooks today
2016-10-03T17:59:47 <jhung> Jess_: ok.
2016-10-03T17:59:57 <jhung> Jess_: I\'ll let you know if anything comes up.
2016-10-03T17:59:59 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: if you have anything you can pass along that might help us though, that would be appreciated
2016-10-03T18:00:03 <Jess_> thanks jhung
2016-10-03T18:05:32 <lliskovoi> ok jhung, I\'ll have a look. I took another look at the WCAG requirement. It does say that placeholder text needs to meet requirements. As far as inactive controls, technically it says that the contrast requirement exceptions include "...text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone". However, there\'s quite a bit of pushback on this, since these elements do serve a
2016-10-03T18:05:32 <lliskovoi> purpose and ultimately you want them to be perceivable.

2016-10-03T18:35:33 <David123> Jess: do u have any suggestions for our OER project plan?
2016-10-03T18:35:37 <Jess_> David123: ok, cool. and was it clear from the planning meeting how you and Kobi will be making your project plan?
2016-10-03T18:36:05 <Jess_> yeah, you were going to work on a roadmap and estimates for the various \xe2\x80\x9cweekly iterations\xe2\x80\x9d to report on in the planning meetings on Mondays
2016-10-03T18:36:10 <David123> Jess: yea
2016-10-03T18:50:46 <jhung> lliskovoi: yeah. One way we did it previously was to use high contrast hash marks when something is disabled. We did this for the First Discovery tool, but it\'s only visible if you have a contrast theme enabled. The default theme had a disabled state that was WCAG compliant.
