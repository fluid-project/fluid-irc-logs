2016-01-18T17:01:04 <danayo> simonjb where is the UIO meeting?
2016-01-18T17:01:59 <simonjb> danayo: fluid standup I think
2016-01-18T17:02:04 <danayo> Justin_othanks
2016-01-18T17:02:07 <danayo> woops
2016-01-18T17:02:09 <danayo> thanks
2016-01-18T17:04:19 <danayo> Justin_o  trying to recall where we left the font icon discussion - cindyli you were going to add a new font for now, right?
2016-01-18T17:10:50 <danayo> Justin_o: gear is e900, cloud with gear is e901
2016-01-18T17:11:01 <Justin_o> danayo: great thanks

2016-01-18T17:16:33 <jessm> gtirloni: ping
2016-01-18T17:17:06 <gtirloni> hi jessm
2016-01-18T17:17:35 <jessm> gtirloni: bert and i are here thinking video replay is down \xe2\x80\x94 more specifically you hit record and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t launch the recorder participant
2016-01-18T17:17:43 <jessm> but i can see the video library
2016-01-18T17:18:01 <jessm> perhaps this is related to the OCAD network hiccup over the holidays?
2016-01-18T17:18:57 <gtirloni> seems very similar to last time when Mike said vidyo replay was "stuck" and had to be restarted
2016-01-18T17:19:06 <jessm> gtirloni: yep
2016-01-18T17:19:12 <gtirloni> i\'ll send them an email
2016-01-18T17:19:37 <jessm> cool \xe2\x80\x94 cc: me? i have a lunch with Rob Wednesday \xe2\x80\x94 we are meeting quarterly until all bumps get ironed out
2016-01-18T17:19:40 <jessm> this feels like a bump
2016-01-18T17:21:43 <gtirloni> will do
2016-01-18T17:22:54 <jessm> thx!
2016-01-18T17:59:19 <danayo> fluid-everyone: does anyone have STUFF for the design crit? I do not
2016-01-18T17:59:32 <Justin_o> danayo: lisa had something to share
2016-01-18T18:04:24 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to share.

2016-01-18T19:11:53 <jhung1> sepidehshahi, jessm - I just sent you both an email with a PDF version of my presentation. Please take a look and give any feedback.
2016-01-18T19:11:58 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2016-01-18T19:12:05 <jessm> jhung1: roger that
2016-01-18T19:12:08 <sepidehshahi> sure
2016-01-18T19:12:16 <jhung> thanks!
2016-01-18T19:18:05 <jessm> jhung: it looks great
2016-01-18T19:18:37 <jessm> one very small but maybe meaningful edit? page two \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99d put mismatch \xe2\x80\x98between\xe2\x80\x99 rather than \xe2\x80\x98in\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 sounds less like it\xe2\x80\x99s prone to the \xe2\x80\x98abilities\xe2\x80\x99 judgement
2016-01-18T19:19:11 <jhung> ah. good point. Thanks for catching that.
2016-01-18T19:22:45 <jessm> ok, one more point jhung slide 16 \xe2\x80\x94 by design tempts me to read straight across in swim lanes
2016-01-18T19:22:49 <jessm> but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want that
2016-01-18T19:23:14 <jessm> it\xe2\x80\x99s the limits of the flatlands as Tufte complains
2016-01-18T19:27:40 <jhung> jessm: ok. I\'ll rearrange that. I kind of like the "This then that", but agree it\'s visually ambiguous. Do I read it by column? is it a chart?
2016-01-18T19:27:57 <jessm> jhung: i\xe2\x80\x99m torn because i really like it too!

2016-01-18T21:26:37 <sepidehshahi> danayo: if I want to refer people to a wiki page for UIO and FD Tool, which ones do you recommend. There are several pages, and for UIO there is page on Infusion..
2016-01-18T21:31:45 <danayo> let me see sepidehshahi,
2016-01-18T21:32:29 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2016-01-18T21:33:54 * cindyli has quit
2016-01-18T21:34:44 <sepidehshahi> and PMT danayo
2016-01-18T21:38:47 <danayo> ok
2016-01-18T21:40:25 <danayo> sepidehshahi: do you want to just refer to the tools themselves, or more info about them? the build sites are good for trying out the tools, but wiki has information - perhaps we want bogh?
2016-01-18T21:40:26 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think if I can use this page for PMT? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Preference+Editing+Tools+Design
2016-01-18T21:40:27 <danayo> both
2016-01-18T21:44:12 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea danayo, I used the build site to refer to the FD tool and the UIO. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything there for PMT. do you have a link to the PMT tool?
2016-01-18T21:44:36 <danayo> sepidehshahi: for the PMT page it\'s a bit hard to navigate through all that info - again it depends what information you want to convey
2016-01-18T21:45:25 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right. do we have a refrence to the tool itself somewhere?
2016-01-18T21:49:16 <danayo> it\'s not on the build site ... might be best to link to this https://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/PMTandPCP-for2pilots.pdf
2016-01-18T21:50:09 <danayo> and maybe this too https://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/adjusters-for2ndpilots.pdf?version=9&modificationDate=1387203890848&api=v2
2016-01-18T21:56:22 * jhung has quit
2016-01-18T21:56:24 <sepidehshahi> Thanks danayo, I think since these wireframes are not interactive, they might be confusing for some users without any extra information. I think the page about PMT includes both thes information and a link to these prototypes, so I referenced that. thanks
2016-01-18T21:56:37 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi
