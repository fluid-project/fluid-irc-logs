2016-10-04T16:00:50 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks for keeping the notes in the wiki.. as we come to some actual strategies, we may want to consider transitioning them into one or guides/handbooks
2016-10-04T16:01:38 <danayo> jhung, michelled: i feel human again :D ready to meet
2016-10-04T16:01:53 <michelled> awesome!
2016-10-04T16:01:57 <michelled> whose room?
2016-10-04T16:02:10 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah, I was wondering about that. It seems a lot of this depends on the context. So writing a "general" document that describes strategies will be interesting.
2016-10-04T16:02:33 <danayo> jhung michelled: how about my room
2016-10-04T16:02:38 <jhung> ok

2016-10-04T16:57:21 <jhung> danayo: I\'m looking at the Javascript for the sidebar now and it isn\'t super obvious to me how to set the default state. Maybe we can ask someone to help. Maybe cindyli or Justin_o?
2016-10-04T16:58:03 <danayo> ok jhung
2016-10-04T16:58:52 <jessm> lliskovoi: do you have some time to talk through and sketch the oak images?
2016-10-04T16:59:32 <lliskovoi> jessm: want to talk about those now?
2016-10-04T16:59:39 <jessm> sure

2016-10-04T17:27:40 <jessm> danayo: coolio screenshots
2016-10-04T17:27:47 <danayo> aces jessm
2016-10-04T17:27:59 <jessm> lliskovoi: and i just had a quick chat about the other images. i\xe2\x80\x99m working on content
2016-10-04T17:28:20 <danayo> ok great, i was wondering about the "good image (or two images) for preference discovery and exploration
2016-10-04T17:28:33 <danayo> whether this could be a screenshot of FD tool? or ?
2016-10-04T17:28:41 <danayo> jessm, lliskovoi  ^
2016-10-04T17:28:52 <jessm> danayo: yeah, i sent lliskovoi the link to the exploration tool above above
2016-10-04T17:29:01 <danayo> ok
2016-10-04T17:29:02 <jessm> the lightening one
2016-10-04T17:29:02 <lliskovoi> danayo jessm and I were thinking a couple of the FD tool and a couple of the exploration tool
2016-10-04T17:29:11 <danayo> sounds good
2016-10-04T17:29:31 <lliskovoi> do you have specific ones in mind that you think would be good?
2016-10-04T17:30:19 <danayo> i don\'t lliskovoi, i\'d just grab something that looks interesting and best conveys the discovery
2016-10-04T17:30:26 <danayo> aspect
2016-10-04T17:30:37 <lliskovoi> ok, sounds good
2016-10-04T17:34:42 <lliskovoi> danayo: where can I find a text to speech option for UIO?
2016-10-04T17:36:16 <danayo> lliskovoi: to match the current styling, it might be best to grab a screenshot from the older demo, just a sec
2016-10-04T17:37:15 <danayo> from here lliskovoi: http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/
2016-10-04T17:37:19 <danayo> will that work?
2016-10-04T17:37:38 <lliskovoi> that\'s perfect, thanks!
2016-10-04T17:38:04 <danayo> great

2016-10-04T18:16:50 <lliskovoi> jessm: sounds good, but it looks like the text per box is about 100 characters, so it\'ll need to be a bit shorter
2016-10-04T18:17:04 <jessm> lliskovoi: ok
2016-10-04T18:17:29 <lliskovoi> I would also say "what you can do" instead of "what can you do"
2016-10-04T18:17:45 <lliskovoi> sorry I\'m being nit picky
2016-10-04T18:18:38 <jessm> lliskovoi: not at all...
2016-10-04T18:19:04 <jessm> Why are things the way they are, who decides, and what can you do about it? Learn how to look for answers in research and evidence
2016-10-04T18:19:13 <jessm> what do you think lliskovoi danayo ^
2016-10-04T18:19:20 <danayo> ah that sounds good jessm
2016-10-04T18:20:58 <jessm> it gets at policy

2016-10-04T18:23:49 <jessm> Using inclusive tools to create inclusively designed research
2016-10-04T18:25:44 <lliskovoi> How about "Learn what tools you can use to make your research design more inclusive?" (so it doesn\'t say inclusive twice)
