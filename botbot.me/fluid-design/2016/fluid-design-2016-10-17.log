2016-10-17T15:03:29 <michelled> jessm: besides the design guide, is there anything else you will be highlighting when you are at open ed?
2016-10-17T15:05:38 <jessm> lliskovoi: vidyo is at 1 \xe2\x80\x94 you have that right?
2016-10-17T15:05:59 <lliskovoi> yep
2016-10-17T15:06:06 <jessm> michelled: good question. i haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten to preparing that deck yet \xe2\x80\x94 let me check the abstract that i submitted to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything i mention beyond the guide
2016-10-17T15:06:10 <lliskovoi> jessm: ^
2016-10-17T15:06:25 <jessm> lliskovoi: great
2016-10-17T15:07:24 <colinclark> I'll be there too, jessm and lliskovoi
2016-10-17T15:07:30 <jessm> great
2016-10-17T15:07:51 <michelled> great jessm. We are currently planning to improve the mobile experience of the guide and try to get the printable version ready in time for Open Ed.
2016-10-17T15:07:57 <jessm> michelled: fyi http://openedconference.org/2016/program/
2016-10-17T15:08:32 <jessm> michelled: that sounds great. i also talked to danayo last week about branding. the P4A folks are eager to be able to put a logo on them
2016-10-17T15:10:26 <danayo> i mentioned that to jhung as well, jessm
2016-10-17T15:11:22 <danayo> jhung I think you mentioned you were working on a placeholder approach?
2016-10-17T15:11:22 * avtar has quit
2016-10-17T15:12:13 <jhung> danayo: I thought those were two different things. 1. Put 2 logos on the current guide site. 2. Add a way to customize logos on the print automation.
2016-10-17T15:12:30 <jhung> danayo: for #1, I put in a pull request last Wednesday for the logos.
2016-10-17T15:12:32 <michelled> jessm: I think the P4A logo is important for the next review
2016-10-17T15:12:40 <michelled> I think we should prioritize the mobile experience
2016-10-17T15:12:46 <michelled> and printing from the site
2016-10-17T15:12:48 <michelled> what do you think?
2016-10-17T15:13:05 <jessm> michelled: i think SAME
2016-10-17T15:13:11 <jessm> we share thoughts
2016-10-17T15:13:21 <danayo> jhung, yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re right those are 2 different things
2016-10-17T15:13:44 <michelled> great
2016-10-17T15:14:29 <jhung> Ok. If you can take a look at that Pull Request to make sure it looks okay visually, that would be great. Justin_o can you verify that the markup is fine? https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/12
2016-10-17T15:14:39 <jhung> ^danayo
2016-10-17T15:15:31 <danayo> will do jhung
2016-10-17T15:15:41 <jhung> thanks danayo!
2016-10-17T15:17:53 <danayo> michelled: when you say the P4A logo is important for the next review, do you mean being able to print versions with different logos, including P4A?
2016-10-17T15:18:38 <michelled> yeah, or basically anything that's going to take us a while
2016-10-17T15:19:04 <michelled> danayo, jhung: our guide priorities should be:
2016-10-17T15:19:09 <michelled> 1. printing from the site
2016-10-17T15:19:11 <michelled> 2.
2016-10-17T15:19:14 <michelled> mobile version
2016-10-17T15:19:26 <michelled> 3. swappable logo
2016-10-17T15:23:20 <Justin_o> jhung: did you push up your changes?
2016-10-17T15:24:29 <jhung> michelled: looks okay. danayo: We'll need to put in a task for some new designs for the mobile docs sites.
2016-10-17T15:24:34 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. See link above.
2016-10-17T15:25:24 <Justin_o> jhung: i don't see any new commits there though
2016-10-17T15:25:42 <jhung> Justin_o: https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/12/files
2016-10-17T15:25:54 <jhung> 5 files changed.
2016-10-17T15:26:56 <jhung> I see you did make comments to that pull. I'll address that now Justin_o. Thanks.

Obviously it has limitations, but he\xe2\x80\x99s found it good enough to allow him to remain remote which he plans to do for most of the class
2016-10-17T16:12:09 <jessm> thought that was interesting
2016-10-17T16:12:31 <jessm> he\xe2\x80\x99s quite a savvy user

2016-10-17T16:56:58 <lliskovoi> this is why we need user testing in addition to cold hard accessibility reviews
2016-10-17T16:57:13 <jessm> #truethat
2016-10-17T16:57:37 <jessm> lliskovoi: it is still the case that the app experience is poor. e.g. he has to ask if his self-view is on or not
