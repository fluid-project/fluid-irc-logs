2016-05-17T20:22:40 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I am looking back at your sketches for the \xe2\x80\x9cMy Journal\xe2\x80\x9d https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Early+Explorations+-+Self-assessment+and+Learning
2016-05-17T20:23:26 <danayo> cool sepidehshahi
2016-05-17T20:23:28 <sepidehshahi> I had a question, under the \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xe2\x80\x9d tab, are those statements automatically generated or entered by the user
2016-05-17T20:23:30 <sepidehshahi> ?
2016-05-17T20:24:26 <sepidehshahi> Because I was thinking automatic generation of questions or statements may help a lot with tracking preferences and making sense of collected informatiom
2016-05-17T20:24:38 <danayo> sepidehshahi: the "took math test", "used X preference" would be auto-generated, and the student could select emoji to rate them
2016-05-17T20:24:42 <danayo> yes
2016-05-17T20:24:56 <danayo> there are also prompts for "free-form" entries
2016-05-17T20:25:04 <danayo> such as "things that helped me"
2016-05-17T20:25:12 <danayo> "things that made it more difficult"
2016-05-17T20:25:32 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2016-05-17T20:26:05 <danayo> I think if we can offer a combination of guidance/structure an openness, that would be best
2016-05-17T20:26:10 <danayo> *and
2016-05-17T20:26:31 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I was thinking
2016-05-17T20:26:44 <danayo> :)
2016-05-17T20:26:52 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo
