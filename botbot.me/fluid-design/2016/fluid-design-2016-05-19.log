2016-05-19T21:25:52 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, here is where I am right now. I just started the the last screen, which needs lots of further exploration. This is for the first path where user has not used eaither the GPII or the dashboard before. https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/0k8sOKnMTJjj7O1
2016-05-19T21:27:14 <sepidehshahi> I should think about the whole flow tonight, there are several points that the interaction doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense, like when you are tagging/annotating your notes\xe2\x80\xa6 I need to work on the other path as well (when user returns to dashboard) then I can figure out how the whole system works together.
2016-05-19T21:28:01 <danayo> this is great sepidehshahi, thanks
2016-05-19T21:28:08 <danayo> i like the goal/reminder flags
2016-05-19T21:28:22 <danayo> will need to have some kind of legend for those I guess
2016-05-19T21:28:42 <danayo> and also like how they appear on the timeline
2016-05-19T21:29:13 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right. and we need to be able to disable them as well in case someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see them
2016-05-19T21:29:45 <colinclark> super interesting design, sepidehshahi
2016-05-19T21:30:32 <danayo> +1 :)
2016-05-19T21:30:34 <sepidehshahi> thanks colinclark, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so rough and there are many points that really don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense..
2016-05-19T21:30:49 <colinclark> :)
2016-05-19T21:31:04 <colinclark> that seems like a good place to start, sepidehshahi
2016-05-19T21:31:34 <sepidehshahi> I think it was a good descision to start from the journal rather than the dashboard. thanks danayo

2016-05-19T21:32:36 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2016-05-19T21:32:43 <danayo> sounds great sepidehshahi
