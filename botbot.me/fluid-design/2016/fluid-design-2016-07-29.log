2016-07-29T17:53:18 <jhung> Thanks Jess__! I've seen Bryce talk before at the ID24 talk during World Accessibility Day. That time he was talking about different XBOX features that they were working on.
2016-07-29T17:54:32 <Jess__> jhung: out of curiosity was he talking about inclusive design then?
2016-07-29T17:56:10 <jhung> Not really Jess__. He was talking more about accessibility features that they were experiementing with for the XBOX. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEmRVaExaY&list=PL95LOQw9SLWxmcZtzBiFuT9HAJKFJnl2n&index=3
2016-07-29T17:56:24 <jhung> Contrast mode, screen reader, magnification etc.
2016-07-29T17:56:35 <Jess__> ah, cool
