2016-07-04T14:09:01 <jhung> danayo: is it possible for you to push up what you have now regardless of its state? I want to merge what you have with my work. I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of conflicts.
2016-07-04T14:09:53 <danayo> jhung, i did, i pushed it on thursday
2016-07-04T14:10:03 <danayo> is it not showing up?
2016-07-04T14:11:15 <jhung> ok I wasn't sure if there was anything else you've worked on since then. If what is in your repo is the latest, then I'll do the merge now danayo
2016-07-04T14:11:22 <danayo> it is jhung, thanks
2016-07-04T14:11:31 <jhung> I just ask you hold of doing any changes until I've done this and pushed it up.
2016-07-04T14:11:40 <danayo> ok, will do
2016-07-04T14:25:39 <jhung> Hi danayo. I didn't realize you had already scheduled a design crit for tomorrow (the new day and time). Could you reply to the mailing list thread suggesting we make the change for this week?
2016-07-04T14:26:07 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-07-04T14:30:49 <danayo> jhung, Justin_o, yeah, i guess i jumped on that too soon! I haven't heard back from Jim who I'd invited to the crit tomorrow (and today is a holiday in the US) - I wonder if it would be better to aim for moving the crit time next week, and have the FD game discussion then?
2016-07-04T14:33:16 <jhung> That might be easiest danayo.
2016-07-04T14:33:39 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: should be fine
2016-07-04T14:34:20 <Justin_o> danayo: do you have time today to talk about GSoC stuff, just want to get synced up
2016-07-04T14:34:25 <danayo> ok jhung Justin_o, I'll let Sparsh know and re-invite Jim for next week
2016-07-04T14:34:29 <danayo> for sure Justin_o
2016-07-04T14:34:38 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-07-04T14:34:43 <Justin_o> danayo: what time would be good for you?
2016-07-04T14:34:47 <jhung> thanks danayo.
2016-07-04T14:35:30 <danayo> Justin_o, does right after standup work for you?
2016-07-04T14:35:48 <Justin_o> danayo: sure
2016-07-04T14:35:52 <danayo> great
2016-07-04T14:37:07 <danayo> Justin_o, that email I sent last week (on THurs I think) sums up what Sparsh and I discussed last week. I agreed that we'd come up with a new post-midterm schedule once you were back
2016-07-04T14:37:57 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, yes i read through that e-mail this morning... were we supposed to come up the new schedule before our meeting with him tomorrow, or is that something we are coming up with him?
2016-07-04T14:38:24 <danayo> I think it would be good for you and I to think through it and then discuss with him tommorrow, what do you think?
2016-07-04T14:38:47 <danayo> so we could come up with a rough plan today Justin_o
2016-07-04T14:43:03 <Justin_o> danayo: yep, sounds good

2016-07-04T15:25:50 <Jess_> jhung: sure
2016-07-04T15:30:00 <jhung> danayo: The changes you have done to the Stylus file\xe2\x80\xa6 are they basically lines 249 onward?
2016-07-04T15:30:24 <danayo> let me check jhung
2016-07-04T15:30:29 <jhung> thanks.
2016-07-04T15:31:30 <danayo> yes jhung
2016-07-04T15:31:55 <jhung> excellent that helps. It makes the merge a lot easier danayo.
2016-07-04T15:32:20 <danayo> oh good jhung, do you mean because all the changes are lumped together?
2016-07-04T15:33:01 <jhung> yeah. I did a lot of changes, and git / merge tool gets confused.

2016-07-04T16:58:00 <sepidehshahi> yes michelled I was goiong to add to that page
2016-07-04T16:58:24 <michelled> cool
2016-07-04T16:58:55 <sepidehshahi> michelled: it\xe2\x80\x99s added to my to-do list. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that done before end of this week
2016-07-04T17:01:42 <jhung> danayo: I pushed my changes with your updates to my branch. Can you update from my repository and see that your styling changes have made it in?
2016-07-04T17:02:49 <danayo> will do jhung
2016-07-04T17:08:28 <jhung> From what I could tell it was the headers on the content pages, and the list styling, correct?
2016-07-04T17:08:33 <jhung> ^ danayo
2016-07-04T17:09:51 <jhung> Should we check in danayo?
2016-07-04T17:10:27 <danayo> just talking to Justin, jhung
2016-07-04T17:10:31 <danayo> will ping you
2016-07-04T17:11:30 <jhung> ok. Just FYI, I'll be heading offline at 1:30p but then I'll be back online after that. I'll be on public wifi so I can't guarantee the quality.
2016-07-04T17:11:36 <jhung> ^danayo
2016-07-04T17:13:54 <danayo> jhung, yes, headers on content, list styling, and also the icon-bulleted list styling
2016-07-04T17:14:18 <danayo> I'll update from your repo now, jhung
2016-07-04T17:14:39 <jhung> cool. Hope it goes smoothly. :P
2016-07-04T17:14:42 <danayo> :)
2016-07-04T17:18:12 <danayo> it looks great jhung!
2016-07-04T17:19:16 <danayo> one thing I noticed - the icons on the intro page have no colour jhung
2016-07-04T17:19:47 <danayo> I really like the tab hover states jhung
2016-07-04T17:20:34 <michelled> jhung: do you think you'll be able to work on the badging section for the ILDH in the next week or so?
2016-07-04T17:21:23 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I can help with getting the sonificaiton stuff into ILDH
2016-07-04T17:21:31 <jhung> danayo: cool. Yeah, I'll add the colours back in for the icons in the index.
2016-07-04T17:21:38 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-07-04T17:22:24 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a draft ready tomorrow and share that with you, to see what we can add there
2016-07-04T17:22:38 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, that sounds great
2016-07-04T17:23:11 <jhung> michelled: perhaps? I don't know much about badging. Who's brain would I pick to find content?
2016-07-04T17:23:31 <michelled> oanna created some early designs: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yts1zr3wibscblj/trainingandmarketplace.pdf?dl=0 We need to distill some of the challenges (How do badges relate to quality? References? Ratings?) and the work done on Outside In into the ILDH
2016-07-04T17:23:53 <michelled> jhung: I don't know that there are any brains to pick
2016-07-04T17:24:30 <michelled> danayo: is that something you could help with?
2016-07-04T17:26:20 <danayo> possibly michelled
2016-07-04T17:26:52 <danayo> I can check in with sepidehshahi as well, about any badging thinking related to P4A
2016-07-04T17:27:15 <jhung> I'm heading offline for a bit. I'll be back online around 2pm.
2016-07-04T17:27:21 <danayo> ok jhung
2016-07-04T17:28:44 <sepidehshahi> danayo: we have discussed badging for P4A while ago but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if there are any written documents related to it
2016-07-04T17:29:19 <sepidehshahi> I can double check with the larger team (Katerina and Eva) to see if they have something
2016-07-04T17:30:10 <danayo> ok, thanks sepidehshahi
