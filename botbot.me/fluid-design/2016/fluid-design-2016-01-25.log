2016-01-25T17:58:09 <danayo> everyone: wiki page about the Canquest game that Jim Tobias created and that I mentioned at daily connection meeting today - it's a simple version of a first-discovery game (he also added a link from the GSoC page) https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Gamification
2016-01-25T17:58:53 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to share for the design crit today. do you have something?
2016-01-25T18:02:16 <danayo> I don't have anything sepidehshahi
2016-01-25T18:03:02 <danayo> everyone: does anyone else have something they want to bring to the crit?
2016-01-25T18:04:44 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: ^
2016-01-25T18:05:45 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I did not read the wiki page and directly started the game. so it took me some time to realize what I should do and how to move the guy. and then appearance of preferences seemed too abrupt and without any introduction, so, at first I thought they were error messages, or I have pressed something wrong. overall, it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting idea to represent and collect preferences in a game. I think this is a rough prototype and
2016-01-25T18:05:46 <sepidehshahi> a more wellthought of game will be very helpful.
2016-01-25T18:07:19 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi, I totally agree, and am sure that Jim would too :)

2016-01-25T20:59:23 <danayo> Justin_o: sticky keys was the only keyboard preference that we fully implemented into the FD tool, right? did we do any work on other keyboard preferences?
2016-01-25T21:01:56 <Justin_o> danayo: i don't believe so, i think it was only the sticky keys
2016-01-25T21:02:11 <danayo> that's what I thought Justin_o, thanks
