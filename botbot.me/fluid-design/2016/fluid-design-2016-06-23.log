2016-06-23T16:05:44 <alanharnum> jessm sepidehshahi: yeah, that\'s a tasking meeting for development we\'ve been doing
2016-06-23T16:05:58 <alanharnum> to make sure my development path isn\'t wildly diverging in terms of priorities
2016-06-23T16:06:00 <jessm> ah

2016-06-23T18:14:40 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think when we mark a goal as completed, all its associated to-do items should be automatically marked as completed as well? or should the user mark them as completed one by one?
2016-06-23T18:18:28 <danayo> hmmm sepidehshahi - what triggers a goal to be completed? it\'s manual, by the user, right? in that case they could be prompted at the same time to check all to-dos as completed (which they could ignore, and maybe the to-dos are then moved to a kind of "limbo" state or something, or they just remain marked as not complete)
2016-06-23T18:22:15 <sepidehshahi> yes, user has to manually select done/complete for a goal. I think keeping the to-dos as not complete is a good option. even in real usecase you may achieve a goal without necessarily complieting all its required to-dos. So, we show the goal is completed but there are still to-do items left related to that goal and if the user desire, they can complete those as well, danayo

2016-06-23T20:42:44 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think if I should match the visual design of \xe2\x80\x9cMy Notes\xe2\x80\x9d section with the log fomrat that alanharnum has implemented? in the way I had it prior to our tasking meeting, the information is logged in two separate blocks under each prompt.
2016-06-23T20:43:48 <sepidehshahi> or should I leave it the way it is, since alanharnum will be demonstrating that with the demo
2016-06-23T20:44:41 <sepidehshahi> and in the design we can\xe2\x80\x99t show more than one or two enteries, not like what is being implemented that you can have multiple enteries and actually see a time based log
2016-06-23T20:44:57 <danayo> yes sepidehshahi, i think we can just leave it for now
2016-06-23T20:45:28 <sepidehshahi> great, thanks danayo
2016-06-23T20:45:28 <danayo> there may be other changes as we do the implementation, so I wouldn\'t spend time on it
2016-06-23T20:45:35 <danayo> np
2016-06-23T20:45:41 <sepidehshahi> ok, great
