2016-08-15T19:36:56 <sepidehshahi> Hi gtirloni, there are still several files that are not uploaded from my local owncloud folder to the online version. Do you know if there is a way to activate the uplaoding process for each individual file?
2016-08-15T19:40:34 <gtirloni> hi, it doesn\'t seem like owncloud has an option for that. is it showing any errors? in the settings, it should have a tab saying "not synced" or something like that

2016-08-15T20:44:30 <sepidehshahi> gtirloni: sorry I just saw your message. If I go to the settings, it show which files are still being synced. but the unsynced files remain unsynced\xe2\x80\xa6
