2016-08-03T14:16:46 <jessm> jhung: !
2016-08-03T14:17:32 <jessm> hey, i was just talking to folks on P4A about the guide site\xe2\x80\xa6 and i realized we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an easy \xe2\x80\x98print me\xe2\x80\x99 option though we probably should
2016-08-03T14:19:23 <jhung> jessm: Yes! We need that. The problem is the file used to make the print copies is out of sync with the website content. Website is more recent and the print copies are made manually.
2016-08-03T14:19:39 <jhung> I\'m looking into getting an automated solution. It\'s on my to-do.
2016-08-03T14:23:20 <jessm> ah, excellent
2016-08-03T14:24:16 <jessm> jhung: people are so fond of the decks
2016-08-03T14:24:46 <jhung> Currently a solution would be to host the PDF somewhere outside the guide site (i.e. Wiki?) and make it clear it\'s an older copy? would that be an acceptable stop-gap jessm? sepidehshahi, any thoughts?
2016-08-03T14:25:32 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99m in a call, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you as soon as the call ends

2016-08-03T14:30:56 <michelled> jhung: Im worried about a stop gap like that. Having two versions of the same content is a recipe for confusion
2016-08-03T14:32:56 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-08-03T14:37:43 <jhung> michelled: True. Another solution would be instead of looking to automate the generation of a PDF file, we instead look into making a html print version. That would definitely be quicker.
2016-08-03T14:38:03 <jhung> Would still require some time to do though.
2016-08-03T14:39:25 <michelled> I think we really want to be able to print the cards in the form we do now. I think it would be a lot of work to create an html version that does that, don\'t you?
2016-08-03T14:42:42 <jhung> michelled: it may not be that much work.  I haven\'t looked into it too deeply, but it should be straight-forward (i.e. adding CSS specific to print output). I won\'t know how complicated until I take a closer look.
2016-08-03T14:43:17 <michelled> sounds like it\'s worth some exploration
2016-08-03T14:43:34 <jhung> I can take a look at it once I\'m done tweaking the mobile css michelled.
2016-08-03T14:43:47 <michelled> awesome
2016-08-03T14:44:21 <michelled> I guess the other high priority item for the guide is to reorganize in the way Jutta had suggested. Let\'s talk about it with Dana when she\'s back.

2016-08-03T14:57:43 <alanharnum> from doing it previously for the TPL site, print styleguide things are not too hard
2016-08-03T14:58:18 <alanharnum> it\'s not necessarily an obvious use for HTML/CSS, but you can specify things like widths & height in inches, etc etc
2016-08-03T14:58:27 <alanharnum> which can let you make functional print layouts
2016-08-03T15:00:37 <alanharnum> this may be helpful - relatively recent article on print-specific CSS features: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/designing-for-print-with-css/
2016-08-03T15:01:49 <colinclark> jhung: It might be interesting to start with some test documents where you lay out the correct dimensions for each page, sort out the whole double-sided thing, and then see how it looks just with some super-simple mockups
2016-08-03T15:02:15 <colinclark> printing straight from the site would be so cooll
2016-08-03T15:02:53 <alanharnum> it would definitely be a nice feature
2016-08-03T15:04:20 <jhung> colinclark: yeah! sepidehshahi and I were talking about this last week. Do we ever see a situation where someone may not want the output duplexed?
2016-08-03T15:06:16 <michelled> if they don\'t have a duplex printer
2016-08-03T15:07:02 <colinclark> I\'d say it\'s worth starting with our main use case
2016-08-03T15:07:13 <colinclark> printing hot looking cards on cardstock, double-sided
2016-08-03T15:23:02 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-08-03T15:25:09 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I agree with jessm. Maintaining two places will be difficult and we may end up having two different sets. It will be super awesome if we could simply press a \xe2\x80\x9cPrint\xe2\x80\x9d button on each page of the site and get a printed version.
2016-08-03T15:25:35 <jhung> michelled: would you have time to take a look at my PR for the guide site? https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/pull/8
2016-08-03T15:26:20 <sepidehshahi> you can resize the cards to a letter size (currently they are half of a letter size paper) so, it would be much easier for the user to print double sided on regular paper with no need for cutting
2016-08-03T15:27:06 <michelled> jhung: I\'m not really set up to test this and I\'m trying to get some headway on the APCP work - Justin_o would you be able to look?
2016-08-03T15:27:51 <Justin_o> michelled, jhung: sure
2016-08-03T15:28:27 <jhung> sepidehshahi: how would you like the output? 8.5x11". 4 cards per page duplexed?
2016-08-03T15:29:04 <Justin_o> jhung: what\'s our target resolutions for responsive designs
2016-08-03T15:29:22 <sepidehshahi> 4 cards per page would be too small jhung, I think two cards per page is better

2016-08-03T15:55:02 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I think you meant 2 cards on each side. right? so in that case, yes 4 cards per page duplexed should work. The only problem in that case is that how users decides which cards to print. Do they select cards individually and we print them all together, or do they select a section and all the cards in that section get printed?
2016-08-03T15:57:56 <jhung> sepidehshahi: ok 2 cards per side with duplex. Yes that\'s a challenge with providing duplex output in general - choosing which pages to print properly. Do you think we can fix this by adding some labeling / numbering scheme?
2016-08-03T15:59:46 <sepidehshahi> numbering would suggest that cards have a specific order. So we try to avoid numbering as much as possible. The title of front and back of the cards are matching, so that should help I guess jhung
2016-08-03T16:00:34 <sepidehshahi> what other labels do you imagine adding there to help users print the cards properly?
2016-08-03T16:01:23 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I don\'t know. I think as long as it\'s clear what the matching reverse side should be that should be okay.
2016-08-03T16:03:11 <sepidehshahi> ok jhung
