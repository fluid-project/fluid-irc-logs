2016-06-20T14:40:50 <jhung> danayo: I\'ve updated my docs-design-guidelines repo. You may want to merge my changes. Let me know if you need help with that.

2016-06-20T14:43:45 <danayo> ok thanks jhung
2016-06-20T14:48:43 <danayo> jhung are these the steps I should follow? https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/
2016-06-20T14:51:01 <jhung> danayo: kinda. It depends on how you set up your local repo. How about we talk about this after the Floe meeting / standup?
2016-06-20T14:51:34 <danayo> sounds great thanks jhung
2016-06-20T14:53:29 <jhung> danayo: actually there\'s some time now. In your repository, what do you get when you run \'git remote -v\'? This will list all the remote repositories associated with your local repo.

2016-06-20T16:57:13 <danayo> yes, just having a quick look through the mockups - is MYL3_VD_1 the latest?

2016-06-20T21:12:45 <danayo> sepidehshahi
2016-06-20T21:13:27 <sepidehshahi> great! I like the my data and the time line on the same panel. it shows the correlations much better
2016-06-20T21:14:07 <simonjb> sepidehshahi, maybe "as simonjb thought out loud about" :)
2016-06-20T21:14:14 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I agree that looks really good
2016-06-20T21:14:25 <alanharnum> i like how strongly it shows the correlation
2016-06-20T21:14:57 <sepidehshahi> awesome! thanks to simonjb for thinking out loud about it:)
2016-06-20T21:15:08 <simonjb> :)
2016-06-20T21:16:37 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a bit more sketching tomorrow and if everything was fine and you agreed on the final direction, Neeta and I can modify the visual designs.
