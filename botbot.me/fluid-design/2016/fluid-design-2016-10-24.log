2016-10-24T14:06:19 <danayo> colinclark, Jess_, michelled: I don\'t have anything new to discuss at the MyL3 meeting, unless we want to review/think about next steps related to this? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/MyL3+Mindmapping+Session+Oct+17+2016
2016-10-24T14:07:30 <Jess_> danayo: is there an urgency to get started on a next-gen MyL3?
2016-10-24T14:08:48 <danayo> not that I know of Jess_

2016-10-24T14:20:11 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: i\'m looking over your WCAG 2.0 checklist right now, did you want me to ask you questions / provide comments as I find them or collect them all in the document and send it back?
2016-10-24T14:21:17 <lliskovoi> Thanks Justin_o, I was thinking in the document, but whatever works best for you
2016-10-24T14:21:28 <lliskovoi> happy to answer questions as you encounter them
2016-10-24T14:22:06 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: okay thanks.. i\'ll start collecting them in the document for now, but may ping you from time to time
2016-10-24T14:22:19 <lliskovoi> sounds good!

2016-10-24T17:16:08 <Justin_o> jhung: regarding the guides link on the http://www.floeproject.org site. On Chrome, i cleared browser data and restarted chrome. The link was workmen after that, it pointed at the guides site. However, doing something similar in Firefox didn\'t seem to help
2016-10-24T17:16:11 <Justin_o> i\'ll keep trying though
2016-10-24T17:17:15 <jhung> Justin_o: let me know, This issue has come up before. So I\'d like to get a solution if possible. Could it be related to a caching service we may be using?
2016-10-24T17:19:35 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m wondering if that\'s the case, either on our server or through a service. I am still getting the issue on Firefox after clearing all the data again, and verified from the developer tools that the page is getting a 200 response and not using the cache
2016-10-24T17:20:01 <Justin_o> gtirloni: any ideas?
2016-10-24T17:20:05 <jhung> What about using private mode Justin_o?
2016-10-24T17:20:29 <Justin_o> jhung: same thing
2016-10-24T17:23:41 <gtirloni> hi, what\'s the issue specifically?
2016-10-24T17:25:58 <Justin_o> gtirloni: on the http://www.floeproject.org under the "Need guidance in designing accessible resources?" section there is a link to the "Inclusive Design Guidelines". It should be pointing at https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca
2016-10-24T17:26:16 <Justin_o> but i seem to always get it pointing to the old link https://wiki.gpii.net/index.php?title=Inclusive_Design_Guidelines&redirect=no
2016-10-24T17:26:50 <Justin_o> on Chrome after clearing all the browser data i was able to get the correct link, but just checked again now and it was back to the old one
2016-10-24T17:27:04 <Justin_o> In FF it\'s always pointing at the old link url
2016-10-24T17:27:07 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ^
2016-10-24T17:27:12 <Justin_o> jhung: did i miss anything?
2016-10-24T17:29:24 <gtirloni> looks like a browser caching issue?
2016-10-24T17:29:36 <gtirloni> it points to guide.inclusivedesign.ca here, when i open with firefox or chrome
2016-10-24T17:30:02 <gtirloni> are you on the OCAD network?
2016-10-24T17:30:32 <gtirloni> they may have a internal caching proxy.. try ctrl-F5 or shift-F5 to force a cache cleanup
2016-10-24T17:35:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: any updates on the status of this? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/577
2016-10-24T17:39:30 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-10-24T17:40:09 <Justin_o> gtirloni: of course now that i try again it\'s pointing at the correct site. I didn\'t use ctrl-F5 or shift-F5, just closed and re-opened the browser.. which hadn\'t worked before at all
2016-10-24T17:40:27 <Justin_o> so i\'m leaning towards it not being a browser cache, but not srue
2016-10-24T17:40:29 <Justin_o> sure
2016-10-24T17:41:07 * michelled joined the channel
2016-10-24T17:41:46 <gtirloni> please check if there\'s a difference between www.floeproject.org and floeproject.org
2016-10-24T17:43:49 <gtirloni> yeah, that is it
2016-10-24T17:44:04 <gtirloni> www.floeproject.org was still pointing to github for some reason, sorry about that
2016-10-24T17:44:53 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-10-24T17:44:58 <gtirloni> it\'s now pointing to our server, just like floeproject.org
2016-10-24T17:45:13 <gtirloni> it\'d be good to delete that gh-pages branch, so github pages stops serving that content
2016-10-24T17:45:34 <jhung> gtirloni: ok. I\'ll delete that branch now.
2016-10-24T17:46:13 <jhung> Justin_o: is there any special approval process to delete that branch?
2016-10-24T17:46:42 <Justin_o> jhung: not really, it\'s sort of a single operation
2016-10-24T17:46:54 <Justin_o> there\'s no way to do a pull request for it that i know of
2016-10-24T17:47:10 <Justin_o> what we\'ll start to do later i think is to make all our important branches protected
2016-10-24T17:47:19 <Justin_o> but i\'ll look into that sometime after the release
2016-10-24T17:47:26 <Justin_o> or during code freeze
2016-10-24T17:47:30 <jhung> Justin_o: okay.
2016-10-24T17:47:37 <jhung> i\'ll delete the branch now.
2016-10-24T17:47:42 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for figuring out the cause
2016-10-24T17:47:46 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-10-24T17:48:06 <gtirloni> np. sorry about that, things that work one time and not the other are very annoying
2016-10-24T17:48:06 <jhung> done
2016-10-24T17:48:38 <Justin_o> gtirloni: definitely..

2016-10-24T18:08:57 <jhung> fluid-everyone: For design crits tomorrow. Do we have anything planned? Deep was going to show logos, but I see there\'s something scheduled on Wednesday now?
2016-10-24T18:13:00 <michelled> jhung: yes, that\'s true - Deep is unable to make the crit time
2016-10-24T18:13:06 <michelled> sorry, I meant to tell you
2016-10-24T18:13:16 <jhung> ok. No problem
2016-10-24T18:14:35 <michelled> jhung: but Filipe is going to show the icons he\'s been working on for the design guide
2016-10-24T18:14:52 <jhung> michelled: ok awesome.
2016-10-24T18:15:57 <jhung> we can also chat about Docs Site remediation. (i.e. what to do in a week to make docs sites better for OpenEd). Any objection if we prioritize that to be first before the icon discission fluid-everyone?
