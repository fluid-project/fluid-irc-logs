2016-07-21T13:14:09 <danayo> Justin_o: Sparsh just sent me this link to the game. I don't think it's much different from the last one - but it does have the 3 preference rooms active : https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/153f686cbf21f9e46b0c5b5a4f10b53986d72c96/demo/index.html
2016-07-21T13:14:22 <danayo> can't remember if the older one did as well
2016-07-21T13:16:06 <Justin_o> danayo: the other one had 2 but the preferences only seemed to work in one
2016-07-21T13:16:32 <danayo> yeah, i think only the size pref actually gets applied to the game so far
2016-07-21T13:18:30 <Justin_o> high contrast applies to the house now too
2016-07-21T13:20:14 <Justin_o> i'm going to update the game to the latest link
2016-07-21T13:20:16 <Justin_o> it seems to have more
2016-07-21T13:20:25 <danayo> oh great Justin_o
2016-07-21T13:21:48 <Justin_o> i update the link on the wiki page you set up
2016-07-21T13:21:54 <Justin_o> for the July 2016 game
2016-07-21T13:21:59 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2016-07-21T13:22:29 <danayo> you might want to explain that we're working on the high-contrast state - right now I think it mostly just looks inverted

2016-07-21T14:28:54 <alanharnum> danayo: if you want to join for the learning dashboard we can probably put you on my second monitor when sepidehshahi & I demo
2016-07-21T14:29:07 <alanharnum> similar to what you did with jhung
2016-07-21T14:29:13 <danayo> that would be great alanharnum, if it isn't too much of a pain
2016-07-21T14:29:27 <alanharnum> should be fine, let me see if i can set up now in mute mode
2016-07-21T14:29:30 <sepidehshahi> not at all danayo
2016-07-21T14:29:44 <sepidehshahi> I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea
2016-07-21T14:29:50 <danayo> great!
2016-07-21T14:31:13 <alanharnum> danayo: try connecting to my room on video? I've got the sound etc muted
2016-07-21T14:31:20 <alanharnum> just to make sure it works & then you can drop off
2016-07-21T14:31:53 <alanharnum> looks good!
2016-07-21T14:32:22 <danayo> great alanharnum, shall I drop off or are we almost there
2016-07-21T14:32:39 <sepidehshahi> we are almost there
2016-07-21T14:32:42 <danayo> great
2016-07-21T14:33:55 <danayo> the aloe vera plant!
2016-07-21T14:34:06 <alanharnum> danayo: my second display is entirely dedicated to you
2016-07-21T14:34:12 <alanharnum> so lemme know if you want me to move it
2016-07-21T14:34:13 <danayo> awesome
2016-07-21T14:34:41 <danayo> looks fine

2016-07-21T14:54:51 <jhung> danayo: I fixed the styling of that Paths image in contrast modes. I issued a pull request. You can test the changes by merging the changes from my personal repo.
