2016-10-18T14:40:08 <danayo> sure Justin_o, how about in my room?
2016-10-18T14:43:47 <Justin_o> danayo: sure, sounds good
2016-10-18T14:44:10 <Justin_o> danayo: i think your room is locked
2016-10-18T14:45:02 <danayo> sorry Justin_o just unlocked it!
2016-10-18T14:47:39 <jhung> Justin_o, danayo - I just updated that pull request. Refactored some styling, and made the logos a bit smaller.
2016-10-18T14:48:56 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
