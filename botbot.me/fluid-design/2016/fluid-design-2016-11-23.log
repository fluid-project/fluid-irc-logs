2016-11-23T18:34:58 <danayo> jhung: it looks like something broke in the left panel/TOC of the fluidproject wiki - the logo at the top - do you see that too?
2016-11-23T18:36:01 <jhung> it looks okay to me danayo. I mean it looks different than before because of the update, but it doesn\'t look broken.
2016-11-23T18:36:36 <danayo> you don\'t see the logo twice, jhung? as well as "Fluid" text ?
2016-11-23T18:37:51 <jhung> Ah. yes. I see that danayo. I suspect the sidebar template needs to get updated.
2016-11-23T18:38:18 <jhung> The extra logo is redundant now that there\'s the logo up top.
2016-11-23T18:38:37 <jhung> danayo: I\'ll take a look and see if that can be fixed easily.
2016-11-23T18:38:42 <danayo> ok thanks jhung
2016-11-23T18:39:03 <jhung> Let me know if there are any other weird stuff danayo
2016-11-23T18:40:44 <danayo> ok jhung. wondering also about the child pages/site map at the bottom of the panel - did we always show that?
2016-11-23T18:41:25 <jhung> No danayo. That\'s new.
2016-11-23T18:41:47 <danayo> if we want to keep it, could we separate it out more from the rest of the content? right now the spacing between the panel categories is greater than the spacing between the categories and the child pages listing, so it feels a bit confusing
2016-11-23T18:42:00 <danayo> it looks like it belongs to Resources
2016-11-23T18:42:25 <danayo> jhung ^
2016-11-23T18:43:39 <jhung> danayo: ok. refresh the page. Is the 2nd logo gone for you?
2016-11-23T18:44:55 <danayo> yes jhung. just one logo now but the logo that is there loooks broken - it has a white background, and also a border around it, and the text "Fluid" appears beside it.
2016-11-23T18:46:14 <jhung> Yeah the Child Pages tree is confusing. Maybe we can put it under another heading so it\'s separate from the content above it danayo. As for the logo and text at the top of the panel\xe2\x80\xa6 I think it\'s just using whatever logo was uploaded\xe2\x80\xa6 and it probably isn\'t square. :)
2016-11-23T18:49:40 <danayo> jhung I think if the spacing between teh categories (i.e. About, Projects, Past Projects, Resources) were smaller, and the spacing between the Resources section and the child Pages listing were larger, that might clear it up
2016-11-23T18:49:53 <jhung> danayo: refresh\xe2\x80\xa6 I got rid of the child pages tree and updated the logo.
2016-11-23T18:50:06 <jhung> does that look better?
2016-11-23T18:52:01 <danayo> thanks jhung - I\'m still finding that box around the logo a bit awkward looking, and also the text appearing beside it. Also - showing the "Pages" parent page at the top seems confusing to me
2016-11-23T18:52:42 <danayo> can we remove the logo background and the Fluid text?
2016-11-23T18:55:19 <jhung> We can\'t remove the text there. It seems to be linked to the project name. I\'m not sure if deleting the name in the sidebar would actually delete the name of the project itself danayo.
2016-11-23T18:57:15 <danayo> can we hide it jhung?
2016-11-23T18:58:00 <jhung> Not sure. I\'m taking a look now.
2016-11-23T19:10:47 <jhung> danayo: phew. Took me a while to find it. The text is gone. Refresh and let me know. For the logo the background is now the same as the rest of the sidebar. I left the border because it\'s a link.
