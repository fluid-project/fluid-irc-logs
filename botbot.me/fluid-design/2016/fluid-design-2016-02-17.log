2016-02-17T16:01:30 <Yan_Hu> sepidehshahi:sorry,I just notice the information just now
2016-02-17T16:08:16 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have a link to the UIO mobile designs, or would I need to check with dana for those?
2016-02-17T16:08:59 <jhung> Justin_o: they should be on the wiki. Let me find them.
2016-02-17T16:09:05 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks

2016-02-17T18:15:50 <danayo> hi cindyli, I updated the UIO integration mockups file with dialog messages - see last 3 pages here https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4c3pni6cnnwuts/uioptions%20GPII%20integration.pdf?dl=0
2016-02-17T18:16:07 <danayo> (linked from the Floe iteration page)
2016-02-17T18:22:01 <cindyli> thanks, danayo. how do users interact with those messages? for example, the first message has "continue" and "cancel" buttons, do users have to click on one of those buttons to dismiss the message?
2016-02-17T18:22:24 <cindyli> or they could click on anywhere on the page to dismiss, which would be considered as "cancel"?
2016-02-17T18:22:39 <cindyli> can users use escape to dismiss the message too?
2016-02-17T18:23:29 <danayo> cindyli: for the continue/canel dialogs, I think the user will have to select one or the other to dismiss the message / be able to use the panel again
2016-02-17T18:24:02 <danayo> otherwise it would be too easy to miss the message cindyli
2016-02-17T18:24:54 <cindyli> danayo: can users interact with the main content, such as scrolling the page up and down, without the message being dismissed?
2016-02-17T18:25:23 <danayo> yes I think that makes sense
2016-02-17T18:26:03 <cindyli> danayo: do you mean users should still be able to interact with the main content with the message showing?
2016-02-17T18:26:13 <danayo> yes cindyli, that\'s what I mean
2016-02-17T18:26:27 <cindyli> ok, danayo, what about other message boxes?
2016-02-17T18:26:36 <cindyli> the ones without buttons
2016-02-17T18:26:42 <danayo> I\'ve got notes in the file cindyli, can you see them there?
2016-02-17T18:26:51 <danayo> above each wireframe
2016-02-17T18:27:44 <cindyli> danayo: "dialog message times out or disappears when mouse click or tab is selected"
2016-02-17T18:28:39 <cindyli> danayo: so mouse click on anywhere on the page should dismiss the message, right?
2016-02-17T18:28:42 <danayo> ah cindyli, I see I didn\'t update page 1, but if you look at notes on last 3 pages
2016-02-17T18:28:50 <danayo> I\'ll fix that
2016-02-17T18:29:08 <danayo> perhaps a chat cindyli?
2016-02-17T18:29:27 <cindyli> that would be easier, danayo. vidyo?
2016-02-17T18:29:30 <danayo> sure

2016-02-17T19:23:35 <danayo> hopefully clearer now, cindyli?

2016-02-17T20:56:15 <danayo> jhung, sepidehshahi: what do you think about starting a collaborative map - maybe using google draw?
2016-02-17T20:56:43 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good  idea danayo
2016-02-17T20:57:05 <danayo> ok, i\'ll start one sepidehshahi jhung

2016-02-17T21:03:42 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also good to create a goole sheet that goes along with the map and we can add more comments and explanations regarding each item
2016-02-17T21:12:50 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi
