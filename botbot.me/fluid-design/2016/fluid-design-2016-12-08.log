2016-12-08T15:19:24 <Justin_o> alanharnum: when you get a chance today, could you please test out the NPM version of infusion. You could either test what\'s up there, which should be fairly recent. You might also be able to use NPM to make a zip package to test out.

2016-12-08T15:20:14 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks :)
