2016-02-24T14:47:33 <gtirloni> hi!!1
2016-02-24T14:48:01 <avtar> colin mentioned the other day that i had found a proprietary version control type service for design documents
2016-02-24T14:48:12 <avtar> this is that service: https://www.pixelapse.com/
2016-02-24T14:50:17 <avtar> it\'s free if the content you\'re hosting isn\'t deemed private

2016-02-24T15:22:34 <jhung> any idea what the storage limitations are for the free account? It\'s bound to dropbox, so I\'m guessing we\'d have the same issues.
2016-02-24T15:26:15 * cindyli has quit
2016-02-24T15:27:05 <avtar> jhung: no idea beyond what their faq states
2016-02-24T15:27:35 <avtar> which doesn\'t mention any size quotas for free accounts
2016-02-24T15:30:49 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-02-24T15:32:09 <avtar> http://avocode.com isn\'t entirely related to the issue at hand but they seem to also offer storage with public links to assets
2016-02-24T15:32:56 <avtar> i reached out to them after chatting with colinclark to see if they offer free accounts to non-profits and got a reply
2016-02-24T15:33:10 <avtar> "Thanks for reaching out to Avocode! Could you provide us with a little more information about your needs? How many users are you anticipating using the software?"

2016-02-24T21:45:53 <Justin_o> avtar, jaung: just saw your chat about pixelapse. they were bought by dropbox. At the time it sounded like dropbox would keep them running temporarily but would be porting over some of their features to dropbox itself. Not sure if that plan has changed now.
