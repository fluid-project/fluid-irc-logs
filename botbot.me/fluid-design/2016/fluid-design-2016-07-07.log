2016-07-07T13:41:48 <jhung> danayo: I merged your changes. Everything is great - your markup was fine. The only bit was centering the text to the logo. The easy way to do it is using display: flex; and use align-items: center. This handy website helps you generate the code to center pretty much anything: http://howtocenterincss.com
2016-07-07T13:42:59 <jhung> Justin_o told me about that site and I\'ve used it many times already. I can never remember which method to use for centering. My brain can only hold so much.
2016-07-07T14:07:47 <danayo> thanks jhung! that\'s great

2016-07-07T14:30:14 <danayo> jhung, I tried merging your branch but got conflicts - github is telling my branch is "1 commit ahead, 1 commit behind"
2016-07-07T14:30:28 <danayo> not confusing at all :)
2016-07-07T14:32:47 <jhung> lol danayo. I have some changes to push up still. That may not help you at all. :)
2016-07-07T14:32:57 <danayo> ah, ok jhung
2016-07-07T14:33:10 <jhung> This probably happened because you have a commit that wasn\'t pushed, and I have since pushed to my repo danayo.
2016-07-07T14:33:29 <danayo> weird jhung, I thought I pushed all my changes
2016-07-07T14:33:42 <danayo> colinclark: are you able to join dashboard meeting?
2016-07-07T14:33:43 <jhung> ok. Let me push my changes and let\'s see what happens danayo.
2016-07-07T14:35:10 <danayo> ok thanks jhung
2016-07-07T14:37:06 <jhung> try now danayo.
2016-07-07T14:41:26 <colinclark> danayo: I wish I could, but I\'m just about to head to the wedding rehearsal
2016-07-07T14:41:38 <danayo> ok colinclark
2016-07-07T14:41:51 <danayo> have fun!
2016-07-07T14:59:13 <danayo> jhung, still getting a conflict and now it appears my branch is 2 commits behind
2016-07-07T14:59:37 <danayo> does that mean my changes didn\'t get pushed?
2016-07-07T15:01:56 * jhung joined the channel
2016-07-07T15:13:55 <danayo> hi jhung, pinged you but just realised you weren\'t online - I\'m still getting a conflict
2016-07-07T15:14:41 <danayo> as far as I can tell, I pushed my changes, but it doesn\'t look like they were merged with master
2016-07-07T15:17:16 <jhung> ok. let me take a look...
2016-07-07T15:21:43 <jhung> that\'s really odd danayo. I\'ve chaged my repo and your changes are in and everything is merged. What does \'git status\' say danayo?
2016-07-07T15:22:47 <danayo> weird jhung, can we chat quickly?
2016-07-07T15:28:37 <jhung> Sure after standup danayo?
2016-07-07T15:29:07 <danayo> sure jhung

2016-07-07T17:36:41 <danayo> sepidehshahi: could you drop me the Framer link for second scenario? (someone who has used dashboard before)
2016-07-07T17:37:20 <danayo> or even a snapshot of what the first screen would look like?
2016-07-07T17:42:20 <sepidehshahi> danayo: the framer is not started. I can share with you the sketch file so you can see the first page snapshot as well as the others: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/FyxYeKqY3Jr1fbQ
2016-07-07T17:43:49 <sepidehshahi> there are lots of overlays, let me hide those layers and you can see the file
2016-07-07T17:43:49 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I dont\' have sketch installed, I guess it\'s probably in the mockups, right?
2016-07-07T17:43:49 <danayo> maybe in the merged panel sketch?
2016-07-07T17:43:58 <sepidehshahi> let me get a snapshot of the first screen and send that to you
2016-07-07T17:43:58 <danayo> or something close to that
2016-07-07T17:44:01 <danayo> ok
2016-07-07T17:44:03 <danayo> thanks

2016-07-07T19:21:40 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I wonder if some of the elements of this work could be re-used for the diagram Jutta referred to? https://www.dropbox.com/s/9adh3t1uw66w2v7/OER%20day%20in%20the%20life%20final%20final.pdf?dl=0
2016-07-07T19:21:41 <danayo> I\'m thinking of the individual views of personal devices (with captions, or different visual settngs etc), while they are all consuing the same content
2016-07-07T19:21:43 <danayo> could also show someone texting or tweeting related to content etc
2016-07-07T19:23:03 <sepidehshahi> this is great danayo! for sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll be reusing it for the diagram
2016-07-07T19:23:10 <danayo> oh good sepidehshahi

2016-07-07T21:12:46 <danayo> great sepidehshahi, thanks
2016-07-07T21:13:58 <sepidehshahi> Once it is reviewed, we can add it to this section of ILDH: http://handbook.floeproject.org/AuthoringOfContent.html
