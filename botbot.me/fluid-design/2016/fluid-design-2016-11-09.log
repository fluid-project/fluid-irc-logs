2016-11-09T19:20:41 <Jess_> Kobi: David123_: how\xe2\x80\x99s it going guys?
2016-11-09T19:22:22 <David123_> Jess_: We\'re doing great, just working on github and starting to program the oer and we\'re still getting to know github more.
2016-11-09T19:22:51 <Jess_> oh great! that sounds like a worthwhile Wednesday activity :)
2016-11-09T19:25:08 <Jess_> David123_: Kobi: it\xe2\x80\x99ll be exciting when you get to that point where you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cdesigning\xe2\x80\x9d your content *with* your page
2016-11-09T19:25:37 <Jess_> keep refining the content as you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to code\xe2\x80\xa6 simplify and be clear and explain and try to see it from your users\xe2\x80\x99 perspective

2016-11-09T19:31:29 <Jess_> Kobi: i know i\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested to see and hear from you two how this next step helps evolve your thinking and content

2016-11-09T20:55:29 <Jess_> jhung: is this still the best starting place for UIO on WP integrators? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=37849612 if not can you forward a better one?
2016-11-09T20:57:32 <jhung> That\'s an old one and doesn\'t quite match up what we\'re recommending right now Jess_.
2016-11-09T20:58:13 <jhung> What I\'ve been recommending is for UIO-WP integrators is to manually integrate it using this guide instead Jess_: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html
2016-11-09T20:58:40 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-09T20:58:41 <jhung> However, if they can wait a month (or so) for an updated UIO WP plugin, that would be better.
2016-11-09T20:59:09 <Jess_> oh, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send the email and cc\xe2\x80\x99 you \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s looking to do an initial integration so maybe he can practice or get a feel for it
2016-11-09T20:59:25 <jhung> Sure. Sounds good Jess_.
2016-11-09T21:02:21 * clown joined the channel
2016-11-09T21:02:29 <michelled> jhung: does that mean we don\'t have any modern docs on using the UIO WP plugin?
2016-11-09T21:03:57 <jhung> michelled: we must have documentation somewhere, but I don\'t know where it is.
2016-11-09T21:04:04 * clown joined the channel
2016-11-09T21:04:10 <jhung> it may just be in the github repo.
2016-11-09T21:05:07 <Jess_> :( an onboarding angel just lost its wings
2016-11-09T21:06:00 <jhung> michelled - the repo is here with a readme: https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin
2016-11-09T21:06:18 <jhung> It should be improved with the next update
2016-11-09T21:06:36 <michelled> yeah, and ported to markdown :)
2016-11-09T21:06:39 <michelled> and then we\'ll be great
2016-11-09T21:07:18 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-11-09T21:08:19 <Jess_> michelled: that wiki page points to here https://github.com/inclusive-design/wordpress-fss-theme
2016-11-09T21:08:27 <Jess_> w/ no readme, so it was a bit of a dead end
2016-11-09T21:09:08 <michelled> we probably want to deprecate that Jess
2016-11-09T21:09:14 <michelled> FSS is a thing of the past
2016-11-09T21:09:28 <jhung> Jess_: this is why I haven\'t been recommending the UIO WP plugin route. It\'s a bit dated.
2016-11-09T21:09:30 <Jess_> agreed re: deprecate
2016-11-09T21:09:40 <Jess_> jhung: makes perfect sense
2016-11-09T21:09:58 <Jess_> the potential user got to our GitHub page and then gave up :(
2016-11-09T21:10:51 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-11-09T21:13:03 <jhung> I\'d love to see our UIO Tutorial page get to a point where it can accommodate all experience levels. As it is right now it doesn\'t quite hit the "I want this, what do I need to do?" nail.
2016-11-09T21:34:53 <Jess_> jhung: +1
