2016-06-27T15:59:11 <jhung> ok danayo just finishing lunch

2016-06-27T18:12:01 <danayo> michelled, jhung and everyone: promised to send an email cancelling today\'s crit and forgot - sorry about that! :(
2016-06-27T18:35:20 <danayo> jhung: having trouble with the link to the svg image for the icons (in bulleted lists) - do I use the full github link? e.g. https://github.com/dayotte/docs-guidelines/tree/master/src/static/images/icon-diamond.svg
2016-06-27T18:45:18 <jhung> danayo: you would use a relative link to the local file. Let me find you an existing example...
2016-06-27T18:46:42 <jhung> Take a look at how it\'s done in VirtuousCycles.md danayo.
2016-06-27T18:47:34 <danayo> ah thanks jhung, i had tried src/static/images etc

2016-06-27T19:36:58 <danayo> jhung: what do you think of having a Home link on every page? i had added it to the mockups in the upper right hand corner
2016-06-27T19:38:43 <jhung> checking now danayo...
2016-06-27T19:41:48 <danayo> i just renamed the latest file to "...template styling" jhung
2016-06-27T19:41:51 <jhung> Oh I see it now. I wonder if it\'s clear what it does. Is it "home" for the tab, or "home" for the site? Also the location of it is in a place where you wouldn\'t typically expect navigation.
2016-06-27T19:43:51 <danayo> ok jhung. we could also rename it "Guidelines Home" for example. not sure where else we could put it. was worried about it not being clear how to get back to Home/Intro page.
2016-06-27T19:44:23 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-27T19:45:29 <danayo> I guess it comes back to the question of whether or not we need a separate tab for the Intro jhung, which we decided against, so maybe let\'s leave it as-is for now
2016-06-27T19:45:32 <jhung> Maybe we can make a breadcrumb appear just above the page title? Maybe "Home > Principles"?
2016-06-27T19:45:52 <danayo> oh, that\'s an interesting idea jhung
2016-06-27T19:46:23 <jhung> Or we can add "Home" to the nav area but not have it look like a tab? I just find "Home" to be a bit different than the other areas of the site.
2016-06-27T19:46:46 <danayo> yes, that\'s true, it is different
2016-06-27T19:47:24 <jhung> Adding a Home link to the nav is much easier than the breadcrumb.
2016-06-27T19:47:54 <danayo> ok jhung, maybe i\'ll try mocking that up quickly
2016-06-27T19:50:23 <jhung> ok danayo
2016-06-27T20:44:28 <danayo> jhung: when i add new md files to individual folders (activities, tool etc),  they don\'t automatically appear when i run the site with docpad, what do i need to do to add them?
2016-06-27T20:45:25 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-06-27T20:46:12 <jhung> danayo: you will also need to add a new entry into the site-structure.json file located in the project root directory danayo.
2016-06-27T20:46:36 <jhung> open that file in a text editor and follow the pattern that\'s already in there.
