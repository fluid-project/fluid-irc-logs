2016-06-09T20:58:04 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo: in the file I just shared with you, I was trying to capture multiple enteries on the \xe2\x80\x9cMy Data\xe2\x80\x9d panel that have happened in a day
2016-06-09T20:59:07 <sepidehshahi> I was thinking maybe mood could be included in the annotation for the tracked items as well as the GPII. however, there is problem here
2016-06-09T21:00:53 <sepidehshahi> e.g. if we are tracking typing speed in multiple sessions in a single day, do we want to ask user how they feel every time?
2016-06-09T21:02:42 <sepidehshahi> or when they don\xe2\x80\x99t change the mood, we don\xe2\x80\x99t show it in its associated annotation
2016-06-09T21:02:46 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-06-09T21:05:40 <danayo> the plot looks good sepidehshahi.
2016-06-09T21:05:49 <danayo> and you bring up a good question
2016-06-09T21:06:00 <danayo> which also got me wondering - how is a session defined?
2016-06-09T21:06:19 <danayo> is it purely by the fact that preferences were changed? because other factors could change as well (like mood or other)
2016-06-09T21:06:37 <danayo> something to consider - I don\'t think we have to answer that right now
2016-06-09T21:07:14 <danayo> re: the mood - I\'m thinking that if in the same day, they haven\'t changed their mood, we\'d assume it\'s the same, and still show the last entry
2016-06-09T21:07:24 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2016-06-09T21:08:00 <danayo> not sure though
2016-06-09T21:09:04 <danayo> and perhaps if it\'s a different day (or some maximum number of hours later), mood would be "refreshed" - so mood would not show in the annotation until they made a new entry
2016-06-09T21:09:32 <sepidehshahi> makes sense danayo
2016-06-09T21:15:19 <sepidehshahi> re: the session - we could define a  session every time they open the toolkit until they close it. We could add an expiry time. so when they reach that (maybe after a couple of hours), their mood gets refereshed and also a new time stamp is associated with all the data that is being tracked.
2016-06-09T21:15:37 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-06-09T21:28:35 <danayo> that sounds good sepidehshahi
2016-06-09T21:29:53 <sepidehshahi> great danayo. do you think if we apply  these changes we would be able to work on the visual design tomorrow?
2016-06-09T21:30:36 <danayo> yes, i think so sepidehshahi!
2016-06-09T21:30:48 <sepidehshahi> Awesome! thanks
