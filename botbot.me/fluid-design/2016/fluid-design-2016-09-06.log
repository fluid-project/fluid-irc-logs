2016-09-06T15:13:22 <jessm> jhung: can you help me find something?
2016-09-06T15:13:38 <jhung> jessm: sure. What do you need?
2016-09-06T15:13:46 <jessm> AC wrote some documentation about UIO WP integration that included the theme we recommend \xe2\x80\x94 can\xe2\x80\x99t find it
2016-09-06T15:14:57 <jhung> ok jessm. I\'ll take a look and see if I can find something.
2016-09-06T15:15:12 <jessm> thx!
2016-09-06T15:24:54 <jhung> This is killing me jessm. I recall such a document mentioning which theme, but I can\'t seem to find any trace of it. I\'m fairly certain it was the default wordpress "Twenty Twelve" theme, but that\'s pretty old now.
2016-09-06T15:25:25 <jhung> The "Twenty Sixteen" theme should be better (i.e. has better a11y markup and semantics) but I haven\'t tried integrating with that theme to know any real details.

2016-09-06T15:27:39 <Justin_o> jhung, jessm: i think it was in the README. https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/blob/master/readme.txt
2016-09-06T15:27:44 <Justin_o> the Miranda theme is suggested there
2016-09-06T15:27:50 <jessm> ahhhhh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it!
2016-09-06T15:27:54 <jessm> thanks Justin_o
2016-09-06T15:28:04 <Justin_o> np
2016-09-06T15:28:23 <jhung> Justin_o:  thanks! I was looking for that but was looking in the wrong project space and in the wrong repo. :P
2016-09-06T15:28:50 <Justin_o> jhung: yah.. i couldn\'t remember which space it was in at first either

2016-09-06T18:22:42 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: does anyone have a contact with Roman Mars from 99% invisible by any chance?
2016-09-06T18:23:31 <michelled> Whitney Quesenvery might - she was mentioned in an episode about voting
2016-09-06T18:24:44 <Justin_o> michelled: interesting, thanks michelled
2016-09-06T18:26:12 <michelled> http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/butterfly-effects/
2016-09-06T18:28:10 <lliskovoi> Jusin_o, I have Sam Greenspan\'s email who works on the show, but I can definitely get Roman Mars\'s contact from one of my radio club buds
2016-09-06T18:28:21 <lliskovoi> ^Justin_o
2016-09-06T18:29:19 <lliskovoi> could you let me know what its for for context?

2016-09-06T18:47:14 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: it came up in our PhET meeting just now. One of the folks from PhET though it could be good 1) get his feed back on some of the work going on there 2) maybe see if he\'s interested in doing a piece on it.
2016-09-06T18:47:19 <Justin_o> jhung: did i get that right?
2016-09-06T19:16:09 <jhung> Justin_o close. :D  lliskovoi, Ariel Paul from PhET is interested in seeing if there\'s an opportunity to talk about audio experiences. We were talking about old-time radio plays in our meeting and how we might want to look into those for inspiration and research. We\'re hoping Roman Mars may be interested in talking about this further.
2016-09-06T19:19:22 <lliskovoi> Jhung, Justin_O, great, thanks! I\'ll see what I can do
2016-09-06T19:19:37 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: thanks for the help
2016-09-06T19:20:01 <jhung> thanks lliskovoi
