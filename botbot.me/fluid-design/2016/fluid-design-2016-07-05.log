2016-07-05T14:42:54 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo, I just shared with you a google doc re: the sonification user testing results that could be useful for ILDH
2016-07-05T14:43:07 <danayo> got it sepidehshahi, thanks
2016-07-05T14:45:18 <sepidehshahi> np, I think we add this to the end of \xe2\x80\x9cExploring Sonification \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d section http://handbook.floeproject.org/Sonification.html. Please feel free to edit or add more information. Hopefully we can add this to the ILDH either today or tomorrow. thanks danayo  for reviewing it:)
2016-07-05T14:45:58 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, sounds good
2016-07-05T14:46:42 <danayo> so, sepidehshahi, we thinking to add info about the test results to the end of this section in the ILDH, yes?
2016-07-05T14:47:56 <sepidehshahi> They are more general themes and feedback that emerged from the user testing rather than specific results.
2016-07-05T14:48:19 <sepidehshahi> So, they could be used by anyone who wants to use sonification
2016-07-05T14:49:52 <sepidehshahi> If we want to include specific results, we should probabely provide more information regarding the testing process, and each sound sketch danayo, what do you think?
2016-07-05T14:51:30 <danayo> sorry sepidehshahi I think I confused things - I missed you comment about adding to the Exploring Sonification section
2016-07-05T14:51:34 <danayo> that makes sense to me
2016-07-05T14:51:38 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if that information adds much value to the ILDH, maybe we could add all the paper content to a Fluid Wiki Page and link that page from ILDH for further details about the resring
2016-07-05T14:51:47 <danayo> agree
2016-07-05T14:52:04 <danayo> that sounds like a good way to do it
2016-07-05T14:52:45 <sepidehshahi> do you think if there are any restrictions about putting up the paper content on the wiki?
2016-07-05T14:52:54 <sepidehshahi> If not, I can do it right away.
2016-07-05T14:53:38 <danayo> hmmm ... that\'s a good question sepidehshahi, perhaps colinclark might have some thoughts on that ?
2016-07-05T14:54:39 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: I don\'t seen any reason we can\'t put it in the wiki
2016-07-05T14:54:48 <colinclark> it\'s a pre-published draft, which people share all the time
2016-07-05T14:54:52 <colinclark> and I think it\'s a good idea
2016-07-05T14:55:11 <danayo> thanks colinclark
2016-07-05T14:55:16 <colinclark> I can see that a brief summary of some of our findings might be quite useful for the Handbook, too
2016-07-05T14:55:25 <colinclark> some of the general themes and tendencies we noticed
2016-07-05T14:55:38 <colinclark> as a "to consider when you\'re designing" kind of section for that Handbook page
2016-07-05T14:55:44 <sepidehshahi> great colinclark. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll create a page and add the link to ILDH
2016-07-05T14:55:53 <colinclark> sounds good
2016-07-05T14:56:02 <danayo> totally colinclark, we\'re planning to add general summary of findings to the handbook
2016-07-05T14:56:08 <colinclark> awesome
2016-07-05T14:56:31 <sepidehshahi> yes colinclark, we have prepared brief summary of user feedback and what we learned to be added to the ILDH and for details they can visit the wiki page
2016-07-05T14:56:49 <colinclark> wow, that sounds perfect!

2016-07-05T17:50:02 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot danayo for reviewing and editing the doc. I think it looks good, I tried to address most of your comments as well. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s add it to the ILDH:) I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with jhung  to see what the next step is. thanks again:)
2016-07-05T17:51:06 <jhung> sepidehshahi: if the content is ready, I can put it into the ILDH later today or tomorrow. You can just tell me where I can find it.
2016-07-05T17:52:13 <danayo> great sepidehshahi, jhung!
2016-07-05T17:55:47 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot jhung! I\xe2\x80\x99ll share the google doc link with you.
2016-07-05T17:56:00 <jhung> Great sepidehshahi

2016-07-05T18:00:18 <sepidehshahi> jhung: if you could, please add the content to this page: http://handbook.floeproject.org/Sonification.html at the end of section \xe2\x80\x9cExploring Sonification and Emerging Best Practices\xe2\x80\x9d you can add a subheader for it \xe2\x80\x9cFloe Chart Authoring tool - Sonification Experiment\xe2\x80\x9d. danayo can you think of a better subheader for this section?
2016-07-05T18:23:23 <jhung> Sounds good sepidehshahi, I\'ll put it there for now until I hear otherwise.
2016-07-05T18:23:48 <sepidehshahi> awesome jhung, thank!
2016-07-05T18:28:04 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I\'m wondering about the title of that section ... because in the end it really didn\'t have anything to do with the Chart Authoring Tool
2016-07-05T18:28:05 <danayo> how about
2016-07-05T18:28:21 * clown has quit
2016-07-05T18:29:26 <danayo> "Sonification Usability Testing - Experimenting with a Pie Chart" ?
2016-07-05T18:29:33 <danayo> or something like that
2016-07-05T18:30:14 <sepidehshahi> actually I like that danayo
2016-07-05T18:30:31 <danayo> cool sepidehshahi
2016-07-05T18:30:36 <danayo> jhung ^
2016-07-05T18:31:46 * danayo just realised that the Chart Authoring Tool has the acronym C.A.T. !
2016-07-05T18:31:56 <jhung> I don\'t have a strong opinion as I haven\'t read the text yet. :) But I\'m wondering if we can condense it danayo?
2016-07-05T18:32:18 <jhung> "Sonification Usability - Experimenting with Pie Charts"?
2016-07-05T18:34:32 <danayo> sure jhung, maybe "Sonification Usability - Experimenting with a Pie Chart" - because it really was only one specific chart/set of data
2016-07-05T18:35:49 <jhung> Sure danayo

2016-07-05T20:07:17 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks for doing that
2016-07-05T20:08:07 <Justin_o> danayo:  your comments about the "enter" instruction make a lot of sense
2016-07-05T20:09:43 <danayo> great Justin_o
2016-07-05T20:09:57 <danayo> let me know if anything doesn\'t make sense :)
2016-07-05T20:10:09 <Justin_o> danayo: could you send me a link to the game again, i think i closed the tab i had it in
2016-07-05T20:10:40 <danayo> oh no, I closed it too Justin_o
2016-07-05T20:10:52 <danayo> argh, I should have copied it into the doc
