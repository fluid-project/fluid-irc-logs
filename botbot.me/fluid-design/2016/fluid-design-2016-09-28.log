2016-09-28T20:10:45 <jhung> danayo: not sure if this is helpful but is somewhat analogous to privacy. Re: stem cells\xe2\x80\xa6 the issue is that clinics in the US are using other people\'s "stem cells" in treatments of other clients. The FDA is moving to regulate this kind of practice. See https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/08/fda-crackdown-stem-cell-clinics/ and http://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2015-D-3719-0018
