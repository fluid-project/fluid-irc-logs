2016-08-18T13:56:17 <jhung> hey
2016-08-18T13:56:20 <jhung> Jess_:
2016-08-18T13:56:39 <Jess_> so, i wonder about the twitter feeds on IDIs site
2016-08-18T13:57:00 <Jess_> 1. can we confirm they are working? 2. can we put @idrc_ocad on there?
2016-08-18T13:57:35 <Jess_> oh jhung one more thing. does anyone have the login information for @FluidProject?
2016-08-18T13:58:43 <jhung> Jess_ I can check the IDI site and see what is happening and see about putting @idrc_ocad.
2016-08-18T13:59:25 <jhung> As for @fluidproject - I don't know anything about that. I have a feeling this question has come up before. I don't recall who had the login info for that account.
2016-08-18T14:01:05 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-08-18T14:01:34 <Jess_> ok, on password reset on twitter it gives me two options:  Text a code to my phone ending in 91
2016-08-18T14:01:35 <Jess_> Email a link to fl****************@gmail.com

2016-08-18T14:02:19 <Jess_> is there a fluidproject gmail account?!
2016-08-18T14:04:44 <jhung> ^gtirloni? any idea? We should document this stuff on the https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Project+Infrastructure wiki once we know who has the accounts.
2016-08-18T14:05:59 <Jess_> alanharnum: sepidehshahi: do you have the login for @fluidproject on twitter?
2016-08-18T14:06:15 <alanharnum> alanharnum: I do, yes
2016-08-18T14:06:20 <alanharnum> the 91 is my phone
2016-08-18T14:06:29 <Jess_> ahhh, ok
2016-08-18T14:06:41 <alanharnum> should we reset PW to something commonly known?
2016-08-18T14:06:43 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it Jess_
2016-08-18T14:07:02 <Jess_> alanharnum: sure
2016-08-18T14:09:01 <alanharnum> Jess_: ok - gimme a minute & I'll take care of it & send out an email
2016-08-18T14:09:15 <Jess_> alanharnum: i\xe2\x80\x99ve been tweeting from @idrc_ocadu and am happy to send out some from @FluidProject
2016-08-18T14:09:21 <alanharnum> if there's a better phone # to use than mine that's also fine - I changed it because the phone number was Jura's :)
2016-08-18T14:10:07 <jhung> Jess_, alanharnum - I've added the @fluidproject twitter account to the Project infrastucture wiki page and added both of you as the point people.
2016-08-18T14:10:27 <Jess_> jhung: feel free to add @idrc_ocadu too
2016-08-18T14:10:54 <jhung> ok. you have the login for that Jess_?

2016-08-18T15:22:43 <jhung> danayo: I was thinking for a future improvement to UIO would be to add audio feedback. Here's something GeorgiaTech has researched and implemented with positive results. http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/research/auditorymenus/
2016-08-18T15:23:38 <jhung> I've scheduled a future community meeting for sonification which will cover this as well.
2016-08-18T15:25:09 <danayo> that would be great jhung, thanks.
