2016-04-07T16:01:03 <jessm> said they\xe2\x80\x99re great for learning
2016-04-07T16:01:23 <jessm> danayo: nothing new, but nice that folks are making the connection \xe2\x80\x94 the cards help introduce something new in a playful and gentle way
2016-04-07T16:01:31 <jessm> like flash cards or tarot!

2016-04-07T16:07:56 <jessm> hahah, i bet tarot spices up SP1 a bit
2016-04-07T16:09:00 <danayo> especially when the magician appears
2016-04-07T16:09:47 <jessm> danayo: i\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the EC reviewers will think 404.1 has a bit too much of the magician in it :/

2016-04-07T17:51:55 <danayo> when you have some time :) I'd love to try out ResourceSpace that Justin_o suggested, did you have a chance to log into the url he created? http://idrc_justin.trial.resourcespace.org/pages/home.php
2016-04-07T17:52:01 <danayo> sepidehshahi^
2016-04-07T17:52:16 <danayo> we could start by putting the guidelines files in there
2016-04-07T17:56:03 <sepidehshahi> danayo:  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried Justin_o url yet. sure. sure, we can start by the design cards
2016-04-07T17:56:47 <danayo> sepidehshahi: yeah, it seems we have to use the same url to be able to share files
2016-04-07T17:57:26 <sepidehshahi> yes, I know. It was a little bit confusing.
2016-04-07T17:57:35 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, danayo: if you use the the one with my URL did you want me to increase your permissions to admin, or would you like to try from the typical user level.
2016-04-07T17:57:40 <Justin_o> i don't know what the difference is
2016-04-07T17:59:01 <sepidehshahi> i don\xe2\x80\x99t know either Justin_o.
2016-04-07T17:59:35 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: okay.. i'll leave things as they are now.. let me know if there is something it won't let you do and i'll update the permissions
2016-04-07T17:59:57 <sepidehshahi> thanks Justin_o
2016-04-07T18:01:09 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2016-04-07T18:01:51 <colinclark> are we meeting about the design cards this afternoon?
2016-04-07T18:01:58 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, danayo: np hope it works okay
2016-04-07T18:02:12 <danayo> colinclark: yes, NOW :)
2016-04-07T18:02:25 <colinclark> awesome

2016-04-07T18:56:00 <sepidehshahi> danayo: colinclark and jhung, I really like the way IDEO has listed their methods. I think we could use similar approaches for our design cards. for the top level we could use the icons that danayo  had already started creating. http://www.designkit.org/methods
2016-04-07T18:56:33 <sepidehshahi> you can see all methods at once, or filter them by design phase or select your own methods in the My methods section
