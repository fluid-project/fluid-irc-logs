2016-02-29T18:06:27 <danayo> jhung, fluid-everyone: checking in again to see if anyone has STUFF for the crit?
2016-02-29T18:06:32 <danayo> I do not
2016-02-29T18:19:31 <colinclark> nor do I, danayo
2016-02-29T18:19:43 <colinclark> I imagine a lot of people are still at Sam\'s farewell lunch, too
2016-02-29T18:19:49 <danayo> ahh
2016-02-29T18:19:55 <danayo> thanks colinclark
2016-02-29T18:20:07 <colinclark> Were the circumstances different, I\'d suggest that we present our HCII paper at the crit
2016-02-29T18:20:21 <colinclark> but since we\'re at the day of the deadline and everyone is away, it doesn\'t seem practical
2016-02-29T18:20:54 * michelled joined the channel
2016-02-29T18:21:05 <danayo> true colinclark
2016-02-29T18:21:42 <danayo> speaking of which, I was about to write
2016-02-29T18:21:45 <danayo> Bosmon: I really like the sections you wrote on "Nothing for Designers" and "Fluid\'s Dream of an Inclusive Tool Chain"
2016-02-29T18:22:33 <danayo> and overall I think this paper is sounding really good colinclark Bosmon
2016-02-29T18:24:21 <danayo> One thing I\'m wondering about is how/whether to include personas and use-cases in the tools section
2016-02-29T18:24:34 <danayo> and how to frame it in the context of user-continued design
2016-02-29T18:25:57 <danayo> perhaps I\'ll take a stab at it - since it\'s a tool we use a lot (but that we use cautiously)
2016-02-29T18:26:21 <danayo> colinclark, Bosmon ^
2016-02-29T18:26:26 <Justin_o> danayo, colinclark: want to present this at an upcoming community meeting?
2016-02-29T18:26:52 <simonjb> danayo: are we doing crit today?
2016-02-29T18:27:23 <danayo> simonjb: doesn\'t sound like anyone has anything to present
2016-02-29T18:27:32 <simonjb> ok, thanks danayo

2016-02-29T18:46:27 <colinclark> danayo: Sorry, I just saw this
2016-02-29T18:46:38 <danayo> no worries colinclark
2016-02-29T18:46:41 <colinclark> I think it makes a lot of sense to take a stab at describing the relation to personas and use cases
2016-02-29T18:47:01 <colinclark> since what we really need to is explore the tension of them as tools
2016-02-29T18:47:05 <colinclark> they\'re not at all neutral tools
2016-02-29T18:47:14 <colinclark> can be used in incredibly exclusive ways
2016-02-29T18:47:18 <danayo> yes
2016-02-29T18:47:24 <colinclark> but that we still think are foundational to an inclusve toolbox
2016-02-29T18:47:35 <colinclark> so like meritocracy, our mission is to somehow recalibrate them
2016-02-29T18:47:51 <colinclark> It\'s too bad we always decide to tackle the easy problems, eh danayo? ;)
2016-02-29T18:48:05 <colinclark> Justin_o: It would be great to present it an upcoming community meeting!
2016-02-29T18:48:19 <danayo> :)
2016-02-29T18:48:33 <Justin_o> colinclark, danayo: anything after march 9th work for you?
2016-02-29T18:49:04 <colinclark> I\'m terrified of my calendar these days
2016-02-29T18:49:14 <danayo> Justin_o: march is bad for me
2016-02-29T18:49:23 <colinclark> it\'s not awesome for me either
2016-02-29T18:49:42 <colinclark> April\'s a bit snarly too
2016-02-29T18:49:54 <colinclark> in that I anticipate having a defense and possibly a trip to Europe then
2016-02-29T18:50:05 <colinclark> But I can work around your schedules, danayo and Bosmon
2016-02-29T18:50:57 <Justin_o> colinclark, danayo: i\'ll leave it up to you guys i guess. feel free to pick any open time slot when you are able to work out a time that fits.
2016-02-29T18:51:29 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
