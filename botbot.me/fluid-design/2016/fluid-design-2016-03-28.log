2016-03-28T13:29:57 <jessm> jhung: ping
2016-03-28T13:30:05 <jhung> hey jessm
2016-03-28T13:30:23 <jessm> jhung: just wondering how all those web updates went?
2016-03-28T13:30:51 <jhung> jessm: just one more update to post (the Fastco design article).
2016-03-28T13:31:08 <jessm> and where are they all?
2016-03-28T13:31:40 <jhung> Updates went to idi and idrc websites. I didn't think Floe needed to be updated jessm unless you thought some of the content should go there.
2016-03-28T13:31:49 <jhung> I can get you links.

2016-03-28T13:34:25 <jhung> ok. Let me know when you have something for me and I'll put it up.
2016-03-28T13:34:38 <jessm> this one: http://conference.oeconsortium.org/2016/presentation/action-lab-accessibility-and-oer/ is coming up \xe2\x80\x94 Thursday, April 14th in Krakow, Poland at OE Global 2016

2016-03-28T13:35:02 <jhung> Ok. I can add it to the existing post?
2016-03-28T13:35:27 * jessm joined the channel
2016-03-28T13:35:44 <jessm> jhung: are you handling the twitter accounts too by chance?
2016-03-28T13:35:47 <jhung> I can add that event to the existing post rather than make a new one.
2016-03-28T13:36:10 <jessm> existing post for Floe?
2016-03-28T13:36:16 <jhung> No I'm not jessm. I think Alan is handling those.
2016-03-28T13:36:24 <jessm> ok
2016-03-28T13:36:46 <jhung> Ah. I was thinking the Poland talk would go into the same post on IDRC and IDI sites too jessm.
2016-03-28T13:37:16 <jessm> sure \xe2\x80\x94 it should go on Floe too
2016-03-28T13:44:09 <jhung> ok. I'll get to those today.
