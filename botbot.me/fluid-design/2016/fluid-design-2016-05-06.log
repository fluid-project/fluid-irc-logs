b'2016-05-06T21:15:56 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi is just wrapping up that last diagram & then I\'ll plug it in & hand on to you
2016-05-06T21:17:39 <alanharnum> I\'m dropping it into the "positioning" section but you can move it around if need be
2016-05-06T21:25:38 * gtirloni has quit
2016-05-06T21:26:09 <colinclark> ok great, alanharnum
2016-05-06T21:35:25 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2016-05-06T21:40:05 <alanharnum> colinclark: just emailed it to you - let me know you got it & it\'s usable
2016-05-06T21:40:20 <colinclark> thank you sir
2016-05-06T21:40:20 <alanharnum> it\'s a bit large so if the email system is protesting i can stuff it on Dropbox
2016-05-06T21:43:36 <colinclark> it just came through alanharnum
2016-05-06T21:43:38 <colinclark> looking  now
2016-05-06T21:44:41 <colinclark> It\'s looking really good, alanharnum
2016-05-06T21:44:43 <colinclark> thanks so much
2016-05-06T21:44:45 <colinclark> and have a good weekend
2016-05-06T21:45:05 <alanharnum> you too - don\'t stay up too late
2016-05-06T21:45:12 <colinclark> i won\'t
2016-05-06T21:45:14 <alanharnum> sepideh\'s diagrams make it look 100% more professional :)
2016-05-06T21:45:18 <alanharnum> as does two-column formatting
2016-05-06T21:46:30 <alanharnum> night!

2016-05-06T14:02:22 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I\'m going to start organizing a version of the document template we\'ll need to use for actual paper submission
2016-05-06T14:02:46 <alanharnum> and drop in what we\'ve got ATM so we can see what needs editing for page length etc etc
2016-05-06T14:03:17 <sepidehshahi> sure, Let me send you a version I have started with adding the authors
2016-05-06T14:25:14 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-05-06T14:57:47 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: you\'re quite correct, the format is such that our current amount of content is only 5 pages
2016-05-06T14:57:56 <alanharnum> so we\'ve got plenty of room for additional content or figures
2016-05-06T15:41:37 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-05-06T15:44:54 <colinclark> So alanharnum and sepidehshahi, just so I\'m clear, I should go ahead and write directly in the Google Doc?
2016-05-06T15:44:58 <colinclark> you haven\'t moved it to a template?
2016-05-06T15:45:06 <alanharnum> go ahead and write directly in the doc
2016-05-06T15:45:11 <alanharnum> i\'ll transfer to the template
2016-05-06T15:45:25 <alanharnum> their template is only available as a Word doc, which makes it hard to work collaboratively on it
2016-05-06T15:48:34 <colinclark> yup

2016-05-06T18:29:24 * michelled joined the channel
2016-05-06T19:05:57 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi colinclark: so looks like no problem to create an accessible PDF of this from the template - some tweaking in Acrobat & it passes the checks
2016-05-06T19:06:04 <colinclark> great!
2016-05-06T19:06:54 <sepidehshahi> awesome!
2016-05-06T19:09:55 <colinclark> alanharnum and sepidehshahi, I\'m going to start putting some editorial comments in the document
2016-05-06T19:10:02 <colinclark> these aren\'t necessarily things we have to change
2016-05-06T19:10:26 <colinclark> but that I want to make note of in case we have thoughts on how to address them
2016-05-06T19:10:34 <alanharnum> colinclark: cool
2016-05-06T19:10:42 <sepidehshahi> great colinclark
2016-05-06T19:11:35 <alanharnum> if nothing else it will help us in the rebuttal period
2016-05-06T19:11:42 <alanharnum> which we should be prepared to dedicated some time towards on June 9
2016-05-06T19:17:01 <colinclark> alanharnum: Can you paste me a link to the guidelines for anonymizing the document for review?
2016-05-06T19:17:27 <alanharnum> colinclark: they aren\'t particularly information, but there\'s stuff at http://assets16.sigaccess.org/technical_papers.html
2016-05-06T19:17:47 <alanharnum> it says "authors must anonymize their paper submissions", but it\'s unclear how that intersects with using the template, etc
2016-05-06T19:17:59 <alanharnum> my sense is that our submitted PDF should not include any identifying information
2016-05-06T19:18:16 <alanharnum> "We will follow the standard of SIGCHI in which all author names, affiliations, and contact information is to be removed"
2016-05-06T19:18:36 * alanharnum will just put a big REDACTED over that stuff
2016-05-06T19:18:41 <alanharnum> ;)
2016-05-06T19:18:55 <colinclark> :)
2016-05-06T19:18:59 <colinclark> thanks
2016-05-06T19:19:23 <colinclark> It really does affect our writing voice, this requirement
2016-05-06T19:19:44 <alanharnum> yeah
2016-05-06T19:28:06 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: please feel free to do direct editing anywhere needed. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we have been doing the past few days to make best of the remaining time
2016-05-06T19:28:16 <colinclark> I totally will
2016-05-06T19:28:20 <colinclark> I just don\'t want to forget
2016-05-06T19:28:22 <colinclark> hence the comments
2016-05-06T19:28:22 <sepidehshahi> great, tanks
2016-05-06T19:28:31 <colinclark> also I figured it\'d be a way to parallelize the edits
2016-05-06T19:28:45 <colinclark> since if either of you see something you can tackle, you can just go for it
2016-05-06T19:29:14 <alanharnum> i\'m doing a restructure of the abstract and introduction
2016-05-06T19:31:53 <alanharnum> i think just for the sake of getting this in we should give ourselves till 4:30 to do any final edits etc, and then I\'ll create and submit a final version of the paper between then and 5:30
2016-05-06T19:31:57 <alanharnum> does that sound reasonable?
2016-05-06T19:32:43 <colinclark> well, yes and no
2016-05-06T19:32:47 <colinclark> I think you\'d better leave the document with me :)
2016-05-06T19:32:58 <colinclark> with the template and any instructions on regenerating the PDF in an accessible format
2016-05-06T19:33:08 <colinclark> and I\'ll submit it when I\'ve finished my section and more edits
2016-05-06T19:33:15 <colinclark> does that seem reasonable?
2016-05-06T19:33:33 <colinclark> I figure there is several more hours of work
2016-05-06T19:33:40 <colinclark> most of which is related to me joining the game late
2016-05-06T19:33:50 <alanharnum> ok
2016-05-06T19:33:55 <alanharnum> do you have Acrobat Pro?
2016-05-06T19:33:56 <colinclark> For example, I think we need to place our work in context of other sonification work in the field
2016-05-06T19:33:57 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-06T19:34:10 <colinclark> I do indeed
2016-05-06T19:34:17 <alanharnum> ok, that should be all you need
2016-05-06T19:34:40 <alanharnum> i just had to export a PDF from the Word version, then run it through the Accessibility stuff in Acrobat
2016-05-06T19:34:48 <alanharnum> they\'ve got some instructions for doing so
2016-05-06T19:35:15 <alanharnum> so I\'ll aim to leave what we\'ve got so far in the Word template & forward that to you before I leave today
2016-05-06T19:36:14 <colinclark> wonderful, that\'s perfect
2016-05-06T19:44:26 <colinclark> Ironically, I have this feeling that little diagrams showing each of the four sonification strategies listed in the phase I results section would be useful
2016-05-06T19:44:45 <colinclark> along with an example of a pie chart that we are trying to sonify
2016-05-06T19:44:56 <colinclark> everyone knows what a pie chart looks like, but it\'s still useful to see tangibly what we are doing
2016-05-06T19:45:11 <alanharnum> i can put in a figure for that easily enough - i think we should have sufficient pages
2016-05-06T19:45:28 <colinclark> I can imagine that #1 has some morse code-like symbols
2016-05-06T19:45:36 <colinclark> - - .....
2016-05-06T19:45:52 <colinclark> #2 shows stacked segments
2016-05-06T19:46:10 <colinclark> #3 looks like number two, but with different textures or squiggles or whatever to illustrate timbral variation
2016-05-06T19:46:21 <alanharnum> we actually have a user sketch of #1 that has morse code-like symbols
2016-05-06T19:46:25 <colinclark> oh wow
2016-05-06T19:46:33 <alanharnum> i can drop a pic of that into the doc
2016-05-06T19:46:50 <alanharnum> a number of people counted that one using a morse-type syntax
2016-05-06T19:46:54 <colinclark> can the three of skype for a super quick sec?
2016-05-06T19:47:06 <alanharnum> or vidyo
2016-05-06T19:47:07 <alanharnum> ?
2016-05-06T19:47:08 <colinclark> yep
2016-05-06T19:47:10 <colinclark> anything
2016-05-06T19:47:17 <colinclark> I mean skype in the "kleenex" sense of the word :)
2016-05-06T19:47:21 <colinclark> so funny
2016-05-06T19:47:32 <alanharnum> i\'m in fluid-standup
2016-05-06T19:53:38 * cindyli has quit
2016-05-06T20:03:34 <colinclark> alanharnum / sepidehshahi: "investigated the user\'s ability to derive data/meaning from the selected sonifications" -- Is it appropriate here to say "ability to understand and interpret" instead of "derive data/meaning?"
2016-05-06T20:03:44 <alanharnum> i think so yes
2016-05-06T20:03:59 <sepidehshahi> yes
2016-05-06T20:04:07 <colinclark> thanks
2016-05-06T20:12:54 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: Sonification #4 is essentially "right justified," correct?
2016-05-06T20:13:10 <colinclark> longer tones sound earlier and shorter ones come in later; they all stop at the same ending time
2016-05-06T20:13:11 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s correct
2016-05-06T20:13:13 <colinclark> is that right?
2016-05-06T20:13:14 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-06T20:13:22 <sepidehshahi> yes
2016-05-06T20:13:59 <colinclark> great
2016-05-06T20:14:02 <colinclark> it\'s well-described in the paper
2016-05-06T20:16:23 <alanharnum> colinclark: shared a Google doc I\'m dumping references into
2016-05-06T20:16:29 <colinclark> great
2016-05-06T20:18:32 <colinclark> alanharnum: Did all of the users who had visual impairments use an assistive technology of some kind?
2016-05-06T20:18:47 <colinclark> and did they all use screen readers or were there some users who used a magnifier?
2016-05-06T20:18:52 <alanharnum> colinclark: I believe all of them mentioned using screen readers
2016-05-06T20:18:57 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-06T20:19:02 <alanharnum> some of the ones who had limited vision used a magnifier as well
2016-05-06T20:41:39 <sepidehshahi> colinclark:  I just sent you a draft. let me know if we need to change anything and after I send images to alanharnum
2016-05-06T20:41:46 <colinclark> I LOVE IT
2016-05-06T20:42:58 <sepidehshahi> gerat
2016-05-06T20:43:07 <alanharnum> ok - if sepidehshahi sends those to me I\'ll plug them into the document template appropriately, along with updating all the sections to the latest in the Google Drive document
2016-05-06T20:43:13 <alanharnum> will then pass on to colinclark
2016-05-06T20:43:22 <colinclark> great
2016-05-06T20:43:35 <sepidehshahi> sure alanharnum just give me a few min to export them
2016-05-06T20:59:32 <colinclark> alanharnum, can you help me interpret this sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cMulti-level pitch and frequency, if pitch means something and frequency means something else, and then you have a series of these that you need to interpret\xe2\x80\x9d (user 6).
2016-05-06T20:59:49 <colinclark> when this user refers to pitch and frequency, I wonder what the distinction is
2016-05-06T21:00:01 <alanharnum> colinclark: I\'m not sure I can - I think that\'s an exact quote
2016-05-06T21:00:13 <colinclark> does "frequency" reference to the tempo of some rhythm?
2016-05-06T21:00:14 <alanharnum> speculatively, "frequency" might mean speed
2016-05-06T21:00:23 <alanharnum> ya, that makes sense
2016-05-06T21:00:28 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-06T21:01:48 <colinclark> did we make note of the user who couldn\'t hear some part of one of the sonifications?
2016-05-06T21:02:41 <alanharnum> not sure
2016-05-06T21:05:34 <colinclark> I think it\'s a key point
2016-05-06T21:05:54 <colinclark> in terms of relating our findings to our approach
2016-05-06T21:06:09 <alanharnum> let me see if i can dig something out
2016-05-06T21:09:02 <alanharnum> can add: Some users also found the particular sound chosen for the Apple section either irritating ("that damn Apple sound again!", user 15) or inaudible ("didn\'t hear anything there", user 2).
2016-05-06T21:09:04 <alanharnum> does that work?
2016-05-06T21:12:13 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-06T21:12:13 <colinclark> great
2016-05-06T21:12:18 <colinclark> thanks, alanharnum
