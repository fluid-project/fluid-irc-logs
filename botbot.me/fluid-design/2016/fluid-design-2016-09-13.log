2016-09-13T13:57:52 <jhung> danayo, colinclark, alanharnum: Justin_o and I have brainstormed some ideas for a sonification prototyping tool for PhET. You might be interested in it: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Sonification+Prototyping+Tool
2016-09-13T13:58:20 <alanharnum> jhung: interesting
2016-09-13T13:58:36 <alanharnum> prety cool idea
2016-09-13T13:58:40 <jhung> We\'re having a first meeting with some PhET devs later today to discuss what this tool is.
2016-09-13T13:59:27 <colinclark> Is this something you\'re thinking of building, jhung?
2016-09-13T13:59:51 <jhung> colinclark: I think PhET is interested in building it.
2016-09-13T14:00:13 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-09-13T14:00:26 <colinclark> Interesting. How did that come about?
2016-09-13T14:02:19 <jhung> colinclark: from last week\'s meeting. I mentioned that we were going to start ramping up work on Energy Skate Park this fall as we wrap up John Travoltage. I mentioned that we\'d like to figure out a way to make some sonification prototypes. Ariel then shared a link to a proof of concept they had made demonstrating a simple sonification "lab" in PhET.io. They\'ve already been thinking in this space.
2016-09-13T14:02:48 <colinclark> Can I see the proof of concept, jhung?
2016-09-13T14:03:09 <jhung> Ariel then asked that Jesse connect with Sam to organize some time to chat with us to figure out what we\'d want from this tool. Today\'s meeting is the first discussion.
2016-09-13T14:03:41 <jhung> I\'ll try to dig it up colinclark. I recall it behind behind a login though.
2016-09-13T14:07:55 <danayo> I guess this is also a start at what we had discussed at the community meeting jhung ?
2016-09-13T14:11:05 <jhung> danayo: yeah.
2016-09-13T14:14:07 <jhung> danayo: I don\'t think this is phet exclusive. These ideas are general for any sonification tool. It\'d probably make more sense to rename and move this document to Floe / Chart Authoring. Also feel free to add to it and put down links to prior discussions / designs.
2016-09-13T14:15:28 <danayo> ok, thanks jhung
2016-09-13T14:15:42 <jhung> danayo, alanharnum, colinclark: I\'ve moved the document to Floe. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Sonification+Prototyping+Tool

2016-09-13T15:51:50 <lliskovoi> colinclark sure!
2016-09-13T15:52:05 <colinclark> I want to pair you up with ewbjr so there\'s a really tight design/development/evaluation workflow
2016-09-13T15:52:28 <lliskovoi> sounds good, should I stick around in the Vidyo collab room?
2016-09-13T15:53:15 <colinclark> maybe give me five minutes or so, and then we can meet
2016-09-13T15:53:32 <lliskovoi> ok, ping me whenever you\'re ready

2016-09-13T19:51:28 <danayo> jhung: i\'m having trouble getting the contrast theme to apply to the dimesion icon on the index page. i\'m wondering if it has to do with the svg file itself. i noticed that stroke and fill are defined in the svg file for the dimensions icon, while they are not for all the other icons. could that be the problem?
2016-09-13T19:52:30 <jhung> danayo: yes. If those are defined in the SVG, we won\'t be able to override them using CSS.
2016-09-13T19:52:38 <danayo> ah, ok
2016-09-13T19:52:59 <danayo> can I just delete them, jhung? or is there a better way to optimize it ?
2016-09-13T19:53:17 <jhung> You can delete them danayo - no problem. It\'s all versioned anyway in Github.
2016-09-13T19:53:40 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-13T19:54:20 <danayo> jhung, I mean, can I just go into the svg file and delete all the stroke and fill callouts?
2016-09-13T19:59:29 <jhung> More or less danayo. For example there is fill="#414042" defined. You can delete that from the SVG. But this removes that colour from appearing as default. We\'d then would need to add that colour back in using CSS (so the default theme looks fine). Then you can change the fill property using CSS from within the contrast-theme function.
2016-09-13T20:03:34 <danayo> ok jhung. I noticed also that for the other diagram on the index page, you used "path" rather than "svg" to apply the contrast theme. i tried that with the dimension icon and it has an interesting effect - it partially works! but it disappears parts of the icon. anyway, i\'ll keep messing around and if i get stuck i\'ll let you know. thanks
2016-09-13T20:04:10 <jhung> danayo: yes. Path is the "stroke".
2016-09-13T20:05:10 <jhung> danayo: and yeah, you may have to mess around a little to get the effect you want. Let me know if I can help.
2016-09-13T20:11:19 <danayo> thanks jhung
