2016-01-13T14:18:47 <cindyli> good morning, jhung. i wonder if you would be able to spare some time today to teach me how to combine two font icon files into one, or add more font icons into an existing font icon file?
2016-01-13T14:21:22 <jhung> sure cindyli. The only way I know how to do it is by using IcoMoon app in Chrome. In order to do that, we need the original icon zip file that IcoMoon exports or at least the contents of that ZIP file.
2016-01-13T14:21:49 <jhung> I'm going to try to find you an example.
2016-01-13T14:21:55 <cindyli> thanks, jhung
2016-01-13T14:30:54 <jhung> cindyli - want to do Vidyo?
2016-01-13T14:31:02 <cindyli> sure, jhung

2016-01-13T15:29:18 <danayo> thanks jhung for helping with the font icons - cindyli are you all sorted out?
2016-01-13T15:29:44 <cindyli> yes, danayo. for now i'm going to include 2 font icon files in the css
2016-01-13T15:30:02 <danayo> ok cindyli
2016-01-13T15:30:58 <jhung> cindyli and I discussed the issue of updating existing font icons we use in our projects. The problem boils down to the fact we don't track important files icomoon needs to modify the fonts. So I'm going to email to the list proposing we start tracking some of this information danayo.

2016-01-13T15:33:40 <danayo> great jhung, it's definitely been an issue for us - I wonder if organising/storing projects in icomoon would solve it? tho probably better not to rely on that and track the font files as you suggest
2016-01-13T15:37:12 <jhung> danayo: you could use icomoon to manage the fonts, but it's a problem if you lose that information or if you need to share it with others. I'm basically going to propose that we start tracking the selection.json file used by icomoon and the SVG files in our repos.
2016-01-13T15:40:15 <danayo> ok jhung - you mean the svg file output by icomoon, or the original svg files that we create in AI?
2016-01-13T15:40:48 <jhung> The SVG exported by icomoon danayo.
2016-01-13T15:41:07 <jhung> technically should be the same SVG as the AI file.
