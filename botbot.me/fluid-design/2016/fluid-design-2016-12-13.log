2016-12-13T19:33:05 * clown has quit
2016-12-13T19:33:13 <Justin_o> i haven\'t  actually tried it though
2016-12-13T19:34:30 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2016-12-13T19:37:52 <danayo> I have to sign in with google and give them access to all my email messages Justin_o
2016-12-13T19:38:12 <danayo> reminds me of our discussion around our privacy tool having access to all your info
2016-12-13T19:38:28 <Justin_o> danayo: yah,
2016-12-13T19:38:33 <Justin_o> danayo: although they say "Privacy and data security is something we regard as extremely important. In fact, its our number one focus from beginning to end. Thats why we built it to run on your computer. So basically the only thing you\'re telling us is what accounts you want to delete. Thats it, and since we use Googles OAuth protocol we don\'t have access to
2016-12-13T19:38:33 <Justin_o> any of your login information."
2016-12-13T19:39:06 <Justin_o> but not sure how accurate/authentic that statement is
2016-12-13T19:39:47 <danayo> i saw that Justin_o - I think this is a good example of a case where I\'d want to know why they need access to all my emails - but I guess any time I sign in with Google that\'s probably the case
2016-12-13T19:40:44 <danayo> I guess what I mean is, I might be reassured if they spoke directly to that information - the emails - rather than a general statement
2016-12-13T19:40:51 <danayo> or both
2016-12-13T19:41:09 <Justin_o> danayo: i can understand them having access to your e-mail address, but not your actual e-mails
2016-12-13T19:41:17 <danayo> exactly Justin_o
2016-12-13T19:41:44 <Justin_o> also their terms of service and privacy policy seem to have typos, or maybe i just read them to quickly
2016-12-13T19:42:36 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-12-13T19:43:05 <danayo> oh dear Justin_o, not great for buiding confidence :)
2016-12-13T19:44:56 <Justin_o> danayo: here\'s a comment from the article on lifehacker about it http://lifehacker.com/this-thing-requires-permissions-to-search-and-read-my-e-1789996108
2016-12-13T19:47:38 <danayo> thanks Justin_o. I think for anyone who doesn\'t know what it means to use "Google OAuth to sign into gmail", it would be difficult to trust it
2016-12-13T19:48:24 <Justin_o> danayo: i think this is an interesting illustration in how you can be less confident with the "privacy" service. Also, i like the idea of what they are doing, but don\'t like the implementation.
2016-12-13T19:48:54 <danayo> I agree Justin_o
2016-12-13T19:55:43 <danayo> Justin_o: part of my reaction to it I think is that it feels a bit sneaky - they don\'t fully explain how it works up front - i.e. that they will be scouring your emails for accounts you\'ve signed up for
2016-12-13T19:56:01 <danayo> then they just tell you they need access to your emails
2016-12-13T19:56:05 <danayo> but they don\'t actually say why
2016-12-13T19:56:54 <Justin_o> danayo: yah that is totally unexpected from how they describe it
2016-12-13T19:57:06 <Justin_o> and they don\'t really explain how it runs on your machine
2016-12-13T19:57:15 <Justin_o> because it doesn\'t sound like it would
2016-12-13T19:57:36 <danayo> yeah, it really makes an argument for full transparency for me
2016-12-13T19:59:40 <Justin_o> danayo: this reddit thread is short but interesting https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/5eta0l/does_the_deseatme_service_pose_a_security_risk/
2016-12-13T20:00:07 <Justin_o> like this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/5eta0l/does_the_deseatme_service_pose_a_security_risk/daojhud/
2016-12-13T20:00:24 <danayo> haha Justin_o
2016-12-13T20:00:34 <Justin_o> :)
2016-12-13T20:01:07 <Justin_o> i had been wondering why it was called deseat, makes me wonder now if the site itself is a scam or some sort of experiment in privacy / security

2016-12-13T20:02:39 <danayo> it definitely seems odd Justin_o
