2016-12-02T19:37:54 <colinclark> alanharnum: This is extremely interesting
2016-12-02T19:38:43 <colinclark> I think the part I\'m most enthusiastic about is this question that D\'Ignazio asks: "How can we devise ways to talk back to the data?"
2016-12-02T19:39:23 <alanharnum> colinclark: it captures a number of the things I find troubling about (for lack of a better word) the inherent epistemological claims of information / data visualization
2016-12-02T19:39:23 <colinclark> If I had any critique, and I hope it\'s a constructive one, it\'s the one we\'ve talked about a lot in regards to our sonification work
2016-12-02T19:39:38 <colinclark> which is a concern about representation as the overarching model
2016-12-02T19:40:26 <colinclark> It\'s these questions that show something else that could be built from the critique, for me: "Can we collect and represent the data that was never collected? Can we find the population that was excluded? Can we locate the faulty instrument that everyone assumed was working?"
2016-12-02T19:40:38 <alanharnum> in lighter-hearted critique of the inherent epistemological claims of information / data visualization: https://twitter.com/vennsplain
2016-12-02T19:40:53 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-12-02T19:41:48 <colinclark> That first question probably leads quickly to bigger ones about the nature of collection and representation\xe2\x80\x94and whether we in fact even collect and represent data, as such
2016-12-02T19:42:10 <colinclark> I mean, the very system of visualization is constructed on that which it excludes
2016-12-02T19:42:27 <colinclark> i.e. eveyrthing that is not visual
2016-12-02T19:42:36 <colinclark> and everything that is not data
2016-12-02T19:43:10 <colinclark> So in some sense, the "population that was excluded" is right there
2016-12-02T19:43:42 <alanharnum> http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/art-language-map-to-not-indicate-p01357 (cited in the essay) is really interesting in light of that
2016-12-02T19:43:56 <colinclark> the question then becomes, how to we open our system to linkages or "irritations" (in the second-order systems theory sense of the word) from the "outside" of the system
2016-12-02T19:44:14 <colinclark> I\'m thinking here, to be less theoretical, about how one weaves modes of expression together\xe2\x80\x94sight with sound
2016-12-02T19:44:39 <colinclark> since we call it "data visualization" but it\'s already strangely captured in a textual system
2016-12-02T19:45:23 <colinclark> alanharnum: that\'s a pretty great piece
2016-12-02T19:45:34 <colinclark> really great
2016-12-02T19:46:58 <colinclark> It\'s really interesting, her connection via Harroway to the body as opposed to the isolated, expanding visual domain
2016-12-02T19:47:43 <colinclark> because it starts to lead immediately to, questions like, how do we materialize the world in different ways as the same time? (to different bodies)
2016-12-02T19:50:31 <colinclark> So it\'s awesome to include the researchers\' bodies within the visual representation, like on a map
2016-12-02T19:50:52 <alanharnum> yup, and i think the encounter with the body (as opposed to the metaphorically separated "eye" that connects directly to the mind) adds an inherent subjectivity that materialization
2016-12-02T19:50:55 <colinclark> but also how to you engage the tactility and spatiality of bodies for everyone?
2016-12-02T19:51:01 <colinclark> yes
2016-12-02T19:51:02 <colinclark> yes
2016-12-02T19:56:23 <alanharnum> that connection to the eye and the idea of the eye receiving an "objective" view of the world is a big part of what makes the claims of information / data visualization such a problem
2016-12-02T20:01:13 <colinclark> yep
2016-12-02T20:01:38 <colinclark> It\'s not perfect by any means, but I think there\'s some value in this word "materialization" instead of "visualization" for our work
2016-12-02T20:02:06 <colinclark> because it takes into account that there are multiple materials and perceptual modalities at play
2016-12-02T20:02:23 <colinclark> and that we\'re bringing something new into the world, rather than just "representing" it visually
2016-12-02T20:02:38 <colinclark> data embodiment :)
2016-12-02T20:02:45 <alanharnum> "manifestation"
2016-12-02T20:05:25 <alanharnum> for whatever reason I\'m thinking about http://mukurtu.org/ in regards to this conversation
2016-12-02T20:06:13 <alanharnum> perhaps because Mukurtu is one of the systems I\'m familiar with that makes a stated effort to incorporate non-Western epistemology into its design
2016-12-02T20:06:48 <alanharnum> http://mukurtu.org/learn/#features
2016-12-02T20:16:20 <colinclark> oh, I\'ve never heard of this
2016-12-02T20:17:06 <alanharnum> friends of mine from the library world interested in social justice and just collaboration with indigenous communities brought it to my attention
2016-12-02T20:17:52 <Bosmon> On her coffee table Rachael has a little booklet from these folks: http://theodi.org/
2016-12-02T20:18:18 <colinclark> Yes, they were the ones I visited on my way to the airport the last time I visited you, Bosmon
2016-12-02T20:18:24 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-12-02T20:18:30 <colinclark> everyone was very interesting
2016-12-02T20:18:39 <colinclark> founded by sir tim
2016-12-02T20:18:51 <Bosmon> Also, PETTRIECHECK is interested in possible collaborations at the "Alan Turing Institute"
2016-12-02T20:18:57 <Bosmon> Whom it seems have a similar mission
2016-12-02T20:18:57 <alanharnum> they\'ve got a Toronto branch (a number of people I know from the civic tech world are involved): http://oditoronto.org/
2016-12-02T20:19:02 <Bosmon> Or could do, if he can incite them
2016-12-02T20:19:24 <Bosmon> https://www.turing.ac.uk/
2016-12-02T20:19:34 <Bosmon> Apparently they are "the" national institute for data science : P
2016-12-02T20:19:51 <alanharnum> NATIONAL INSTITUTE FIGHT
2016-12-02T20:19:57 <Bosmon> :)
2016-12-02T20:20:20 <colinclark> this is interesting
2016-12-02T20:20:21 <Bosmon> mukurtu seems to have a very interesting mission
2016-12-02T20:20:25 <Bosmon> I wonder how they will deliver on that
2016-12-02T20:20:40 <colinclark> what kinds of collaborations is Tomas interested in?
2016-12-02T20:20:44 <Bosmon> What is, for example, a "Cultural Protocol"
2016-12-02T20:20:56 <Bosmon> colinclark - essentially anything, since the institute is just finding its feet
2016-12-02T20:21:15 <Bosmon> And it seems that he is a significant if not overwhelming proportion of their data science contingent : P
2016-12-02T20:21:25 <colinclark> do they have funding sources lined up, or in mind to apply to?
2016-12-02T20:21:31 <colinclark> or are they themselves a funding source?
2016-12-02T20:21:36 <Bosmon> It seems they are supported by Google a lot
2016-12-02T20:21:41 <Bosmon> They are underwriting his current position
2016-12-02T20:22:08 <colinclark> My understanding of the ODI is that they\'re funded half by grants and the other half by doing consulting and services work
2016-12-02T20:22:44 <colinclark> I really enjoyed that visit
2016-12-02T20:22:52 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I properly thanked them or Amy for arranging it
2016-12-02T20:23:25 <Bosmon> Apparently they have dispatched us the next consignment on the conveyor belt of oversized baby clothes
2016-12-02T20:23:32 <Bosmon> In characteristic disorganisation, we were not in to receive it
2016-12-02T20:23:55 <colinclark> ha
2016-12-02T20:24:20 <colinclark> amazing to think he\'s already outgrowing the first round, which you said was huge on him initially
2016-12-02T20:25:22 <Bosmon> Yes well, those were clothes that she intended for a newborn :)
2016-12-02T20:25:39 <Bosmon> He is more than a factor of two heavier than then
2016-12-02T20:26:05 <colinclark> :)
2016-12-02T20:26:19 <Bosmon> I would *love* to see an example of a "Mukurtu Cultural Protocol" more than just a single bullet point
2016-12-02T20:26:32 <Bosmon> From the description they could be practically anything
2016-12-02T20:27:15 <Bosmon> OWG
2016-12-02T20:27:20 <Bosmon> It is a GIANT HEAP OF PHP (TM)
2016-12-02T20:27:25 <alanharnum> well
2016-12-02T20:27:27 <alanharnum> it\'s built on Drupal
2016-12-02T20:27:36 <alanharnum> which is very common for digital heritage systems
2016-12-02T20:28:00 <Bosmon> For the sake of Mike
2016-12-02T20:28:01 <Bosmon> https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/mukurtucms/blob/master/update.php
2016-12-02T20:29:54 <Bosmon> They do have a kind of namespacing
2016-12-02T20:31:44 <alanharnum> at least in the context of Mukurtu, when they talk about cultural protocols they mean the kinds of things that are discussed here: http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1448995219999
2016-12-02T20:31:55 <Bosmon> Cheers
2016-12-02T20:32:38 <alanharnum> i believe the term as used in Mukurtu comes from the museum studies field originally, and is essentially concerned with the respectful preservation, care and treatment of objects that have a particular cultural significance
2016-12-02T20:32:41 <Bosmon> Ok, I see
2016-12-02T20:32:47 <Bosmon> Protocols actually pertaining to a culture
2016-12-02T20:33:08 <Bosmon> I imagined that somehow the CMS itself actually had cultural protocols :)
2016-12-02T20:33:14 <Bosmon> Although I guess you could say that in a way it does
2016-12-02T20:33:26 <Bosmon> The cultural protocols hallowed by the Drupal and PHP communities :)
2016-12-02T20:33:45 <alanharnum> haha
2016-12-02T20:33:54 <Bosmon> Which hold certain things sacred
2016-12-02T20:33:57 <Bosmon> And certain others profane
2016-12-02T20:34:06 <alanharnum> not inaccurate
2016-12-02T20:34:32 <alanharnum> a linter, under this terminology, is a means of enforcing cultural protocol
