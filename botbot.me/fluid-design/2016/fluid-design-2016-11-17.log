2016-11-17T15:25:53 <Justin_o> jhung: could you or dana help Bosmon with this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/103#discussion_r88474483
2016-11-17T15:27:22 <jhung> Justin_o: I can help with that. bosmon, do you have a sketch of what it should look like?
2016-11-17T15:27:32 <jhung> ^Bosmon
2016-11-17T15:28:16 <Bosmon> jhung - a lot like the existing one, only correct :)
2016-11-17T15:28:38 <Bosmon> Of course, it could look a lot nicer than the existing one, since that one was produced by an engineer armed with a copy of 1990s Visio : P
2016-11-17T15:29:55 <jhung> Bosmon: ah so there\'s an existing image that needs to be updated and converted to SVG.
2016-11-17T15:30:12 <Bosmon> yup, that\'s right
2016-11-17T15:30:29 <jhung> Which image is that Bosmon? Can you send me a link to the file in the repo?
2016-11-17T15:31:16 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/images/IoC-scope.svg
2016-11-17T15:31:35 <Bosmon> So, the "static environment" and the "dynamic environment" are gone
2016-11-17T15:32:20 <Bosmon> AND, components which are at the global root of the tree or a direct child of it are no longer resolvable
2016-11-17T15:32:40 <Bosmon> So the ones numbered "7", "8" and "5" in the diagram are no longer resolvable
2016-11-17T15:33:15 <Bosmon> BUT INSTEAD any component can be marked as "fluid.resolveRoot" in which case an alias of them is registered as a child of a special, separate root component which makes them resolvable
2016-11-17T15:33:41 <Bosmon> And since there is a single, global component tree the wording "root of this component tree" is incorrect
2016-11-17T15:33:55 <Bosmon> Since every component is now attached to some point in the single global tree
2016-11-17T15:41:05 <jhung> ok Bosmon. I\'ll start on this later today. I\'ll probably need you or Justin_o to take a look at it a few times to make sure it\'s accurate.
2016-11-17T15:41:16 <Bosmon> Awesome - thanks jhung!

2016-11-17T20:14:10 <Justin_o> i\'m free to chat now if you like
2016-11-17T20:16:33 <Jess_> michelled: i was following the notes\xe2\x80\xa6 is there anything else I can use to catch up?
2016-11-17T20:17:40 <michelled> Jess_: alanharnum is going to send a summary to the list
2016-11-17T20:17:47 <Jess_> great, thanks

2016-11-17T20:42:10 <Jess_> i can\xe2\x80\x99t remember if it was mentioned before so i thought i\xe2\x80\x99d put it in there now

2016-11-17T20:50:40 <alanharnum> danayo, looking at the co-design session doc - are we going to need the collaboration room set up to play Minecraft?
2016-11-17T20:52:30 <danayo> alanharnum: yeah, that\'s the idea. It would be best if we could project it - so I guess as long as Calum can share the screen ?
2016-11-17T20:52:57 <alanharnum> danayo: I could see about installing it on the Windows 10 PC that we move into the lab for demos
2016-11-17T20:53:05 <alanharnum> i\'ve projected that successfully
2016-11-17T20:53:35 <danayo> ok, cool alanharnum. I had asked Caren if they might be bringing their own device - but I guess that could get tricky in terms of projecting
2016-11-17T20:53:49 <alanharnum> danayo: anything with HDMI is pretty easy to set up
2016-11-17T20:54:04 <alanharnum> do you happen to know what Calum plays on typically?
2016-11-17T20:54:17 <alanharnum> PC or console?
2016-11-17T20:54:22 <danayo> I don\'t alanharnum - that\'s what I have asked Caren
2016-11-17T20:54:25 <alanharnum> ok
2016-11-17T20:54:52 <alanharnum> i can also potentially get a copy of Minecraft for PS4 and bring my PS4 in
2016-11-17T20:55:38 <danayo> great alanharnum. I guess as long as we have something at the ready ourselves - and then we can re-adjust if they bring something in. If I hear back before Monday I\'ll let you know
2016-11-17T20:57:12 <alanharnum> danayo: i\'ll test a setup tomorrow and make sure it\'s working
2016-11-17T20:58:00 <danayo> awesome alanharnum! thanks
2016-11-17T20:58:06 <jhung> Bosmon: I\'ve made a rather weak attempt at a new drawing after Justin_o bravely tried to explain things to me. Can you take a look at the drawing so far and suggest / make edits? Once the content is satisfactory, I can then produce a proper SVG of it. https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14ESiMe0q8_lzVsAE-CkUvZdU42A_rs0_IfYg54pNFjA/edit?usp=sharing
