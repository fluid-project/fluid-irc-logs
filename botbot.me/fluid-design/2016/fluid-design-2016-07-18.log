b"2016-07-18T20:22:54 <danayo> great, thanks!
2016-07-18T20:23:10 <jhung> So it looks okay danayo? I can do the merge here.
2016-07-18T20:23:16 <danayo> yes jhung
2016-07-18T20:23:24 <jhung> ok. thanks danayo
2016-07-18T20:24:52 <jhung> changes are live danayo: http://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/
2016-07-18T20:25:56 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi, alanharnum: does this look acceptable? https://jhung.github.io/docs-inclusive-learning/AuthoringOfContent.html
2016-07-18T20:26:05 <danayo> ah, nice jhung, just had to clear my cache. it's looking great. thanks
2016-07-18T20:26:34 <jhung> I had to make up the captions for the images. Let me know if those need to be edited. danayo, sepidehshahi, alanharnum
2016-07-18T20:27:08 <jhung> Note: the images don't show up.
2016-07-18T20:28:52 <sepidehshahi> jhung do you need another format for the images?
2016-07-18T20:29:37 <danayo> the link to the demo isn't there either jhung
2016-07-18T20:30:04 <jhung> sepidehshahi: what you gave me was good.
2016-07-18T20:30:28 <jhung> danayo: ok. I missed thosed. I'll add the links in.
2016-07-18T20:30:48 <sepidehshahi> so, what can we do to make the images show up jhung ?
2016-07-18T20:31:19 <sepidehshahi> the captions look good to me jhung
2016-07-18T20:32:51 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I'm fixing the images right now.
2016-07-18T20:32:53 <danayo> jhung, the last section (Long-Term Vision) needs to be a list (there are 2 items)
2016-07-18T20:32:59 <danayo> a bulleted list, I mean
2016-07-18T20:33:16 <jhung> ok danayo. I also missed a few other links (flocking, D3, and infusion)
2016-07-18T20:33:28 <sepidehshahi> ok thanks jhung
2016-07-18T20:34:00 <danayo> thanks jhung, all else looks good to me
2016-07-18T20:34:35 <jhung> danayo sepidehshahi thanks. I'll go over it again and fix those issues. I'll let you know when I've updated.
2016-07-18T20:41:20 <sepidehshahi> danayo: and jhung in the design guides website, I just noticed that when you select any of the contrast settings except the original one, the Practices icon appears as a square instead of a diamond
2016-07-18T20:41:44 <danayo> oooh, good catch sepidehshahi
2016-07-18T20:42:08 <sepidehshahi> the same thing happens to the activities and principles when selected
2016-07-18T20:42:17 <danayo> yes, just noticed that
2016-07-18T20:42:44 <danayo> also, that left border line appears
2016-07-18T20:43:12 <danayo> looks like jhung is gone sepidehshahi, but I'll see if I can figure out what's happening
2016-07-18T20:43:16 <danayo> thanks
2016-07-18T20:43:26 <danayo> please feel free to test it some more!!
2016-07-18T20:43:38 <sepidehshahi> sure:)
2016-07-18T20:44:20 <danayo> i think it's not actually teh square icon itself sepidehshahi, but rather that the background of the icon is filling in the space around it, if that makes sense
2016-07-18T20:45:09 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo because once you select the tab you see the icon then it background that is a square shows up

2016-07-18T14:16:11 <danayo> hello jhung, i see that the guide repo was transferred, is that right? do you have a few minutes to check in? wondering if there is anything remaining to be done, and also would love to know if my approach to creating the inline svgs was correct
2016-07-18T14:18:55 <danayo> looking in github - I guess you just renamed all those md files, is that right jhung?
2016-07-18T14:19:07 <jhung> danayo: yes the repo has been transferred. gtirloni is helping getting that domain set up. Right now there\'s nothing else to do. Your approach is correct, the problem was a quirkiness with docpad.
2016-07-18T14:19:57 <danayo> ok, thanks jhung
2016-07-18T14:19:58 <gtirloni> jhung: was it transferred already? i think i missed that
2016-07-18T14:20:58 <jhung> gtirloni: yeah. No worries as long as it\'s up by Thursday. :D
2016-07-18T14:21:28 <gtirloni> ok, i think that\'s enough time. was that announced here?
2016-07-18T14:22:37 <gtirloni> and more importantly, where is it? i can\'t seem to see the repo.. is it called "guide" or something?
2016-07-18T14:26:01 <danayo> gtirloni, it\'s guide.inclusivedesign.ca, under inclusive-design
2016-07-18T14:26:06 <danayo> is that right, jhung?
2016-07-18T14:26:21 <jhung> gtirloni: I\'m fairly sure I did mentioned it here on Thursday. I had also made a request for an update to the ILDH, so perhaps the two got confused.
2016-07-18T14:26:47 <jhung> yes danayo gtirloni, that\'s the correct URL.
2016-07-18T14:26:49 <gtirloni> sorry, i was looking at the fluid-project organization
2016-07-18T14:27:09 <gtirloni> ok, i will start working on it today. it shouldn\'t take long
2016-07-18T14:27:33 <jhung> gtirloni: sorry and thanks!
2016-07-18T14:33:51 <danayo> thanks gtirloni, jhung - it\'s looking great and I\'m excited to get it up and running!

I was also thinking about our workshop next week and had an idea. So, maybe we could meet this afternoon if you are available
2016-07-18T15:49:59 <danayo> sound good sepidehshahi, I can meet anytime, other than 3-4pm ET
2016-07-18T15:50:14 <sepidehshahi> that;s perfecct danayo
2016-07-18T15:51:12 <danayo> do you want to aim for 2pm sepidehshahi?
2016-07-18T15:51:33 <sepidehshahi> SUre, let\xe2\x80\x99s meet at 2:00

2016-07-18T16:38:36 <jhung> alanharnum, danayo, sepidehshahi: Is the content for the Floe Chart Authoring Toold case study ready? I was going to add it to the ILDH now...
2016-07-18T16:38:55 <alanharnum> jhung sepidehshahi danayo: I looked it over & it looks good to me
2016-07-18T16:39:32 <jhung> awesome. I\'ll start adding it to the ILDH now\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-07-18T16:39:58 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-07-18T16:40:23 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi - are the images used for this section in OwnCloud?
2016-07-18T16:45:13 <sepidehshahi> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the OwnCloud Link for these images
2016-07-18T16:45:24 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: thanks for reviewing the content
2016-07-18T16:46:28 <sepidehshahi> jhung: do we have a section for ILDH on Owncloud?
2016-07-18T16:47:54 <jhung> No sepidehshahi. It\'s all in github.
2016-07-18T16:48:22 <jhung> sepidehshahi: if you have the images you can just tell me where they\'re located and I\'ll copy them to the ILDH.
2016-07-18T16:53:40 <sepidehshahi> jhung: you can find them here: Visual resources > Project Images > Floe Chart Authoring Tool. It\xe2\x80\x99s still syncing. So, please give it some time and it should show up in your owncloud folder

2016-07-18T17:27:42 <jhung> Weird danayo. The wiki should handle that/
2016-07-18T17:27:58 <danayo> yeah, it\'s weird
2016-07-18T17:30:05 <danayo> it seems to load the correct section/URL, but doesn\'t scroll to it, jhung
2016-07-18T17:31:09 <jhung> ok. I\'ll take a look at it in a bit. Just about to jump offline danayo
2016-07-18T18:01:13 <sepidehshahi> danayo: are you available to mee now?

2016-07-18T18:42:12 <sepidehshahi> Hi colinclark, from a musician\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, do you know if there are any specific functionalities that should be included in sliders? Dinuka is going to start working on the Slider and we wanted to make sure it addresses the needs of musicians.
2016-07-18T18:42:23 <colinclark> hey sepidehshahi
2016-07-18T18:42:31 <colinclark> yes, sorry, I saw your question last week but didn\'t get a chance to answer
2016-07-18T18:42:39 <sepidehshahi> no worries:)
2016-07-18T18:42:39 <colinclark> I guess sliders are pretty interesting
2016-07-18T18:42:47 <colinclark> they\'re ultimately a lot more useful for most things than knobs
2016-07-18T18:42:57 <colinclark> but the one advantage knobs have is that they don\'t take up a lot of space
2016-07-18T18:43:27 <colinclark> I guess the key aspect of a slider is that\'s really really clear where it\'s located, relative to the parameter space it\'s mapped to
2016-07-18T18:43:36 <colinclark> So, like, if a slider is mapped to the volume
2016-07-18T18:43:49 <colinclark> it\'s easy (or should be) to see at a glance that the volume is halfway up
2016-07-18T18:43:52 <colinclark> or whatever
2016-07-18T18:44:06 <colinclark> it\'s often nice to have the option of notches in a slider
2016-07-18T18:44:20 <colinclark> so you can then see position relative to a certain scale
2016-07-18T18:44:23 <colinclark> like decibels or whatever
2016-07-18T18:45:44 <sepidehshahi> great points! thanks colinclark
2016-07-18T18:45:53 <colinclark> So here\'s a picture of a mixer board: https://www.gearslutz.com/board/attachments/remote-possibilities-acoustic-music-location-recording/135360d1252461061-mobile-mixer-x-desk_top_large.jpg
2016-07-18T18:46:02 <colinclark> and you see how the faders all have a funny scale on them
2016-07-18T18:46:04 <colinclark> decibels
2016-07-18T18:46:12 <colinclark> it\'s really useful to have the notches and the units shown on it
2016-07-18T18:46:19 <colinclark> in a way that might be overkill for a regular slider UI
2016-07-18T18:46:38 <colinclark> Other than that, I\'m trying to think if there\'s anything else
2016-07-18T18:46:46 <colinclark> you can see on the mixer board that they blend knobs and sliders
2016-07-18T18:46:51 <colinclark> the sliders for the most important controls
2016-07-18T18:46:59 <colinclark> the knobs for less-frequently used/changed ones
2016-07-18T18:47:01 <colinclark> like equalization
2016-07-18T18:47:18 <colinclark> (also you can imagine how huge the mixer board would be if it were all sliders)
2016-07-18T18:47:20 <colinclark> huge and confusing
2016-07-18T18:49:36 <colinclark> being able to colour-code them in some way is also useful, sepidehshahi
2016-07-18T18:49:57 <colinclark> I guess you\'d assume that would be part of Dinuka\'s stylesheets
2016-07-18T18:49:57 <sepidehshahi> right. I was reading about sliders and one thing they all mentioned is that slider is not the best tool if you want to select exact value. So, when you use these faders do you set them on exact values or in a range like somewhere between 20 and 30?
2016-07-18T18:50:10 <colinclark> yeah, usually the latter, sepidehshahi
2016-07-18T18:50:28 <colinclark> you\'re often adjusting things by ear
2016-07-18T18:50:47 <sepidehshahi> ah, I see
2016-07-18T18:51:03 <sepidehshahi> awesome thanks a lot colinclark
2016-07-18T18:52:57 <colinclark> no problem
2016-07-18T18:53:03 <colinclark> i\'m trying to think if there\'s anything else

2016-07-18T19:09:58 <jhung> i\'ve made fixes for the tab navigation / index redirects

2016-07-18T19:37:01 <danayo> jhung1: your changes look good to me. One question - I noticed you\'re not using the variables (i.e. "categoryHref" & "defaultPage") in the index.html.md.handlebars file in the way that you are in the header.html.handlebars file - is there a reason for that? should we be consistent?
2016-07-18T19:37:39 * jhung joined the channel
2016-07-18T19:38:44 <danayo> jhung ^
2016-07-18T19:40:00 <jhung> sorry danayo. The network where I am is poor. I think I missed your message. I\'m trying to load the IRC log now.
2016-07-18T19:43:19 <danayo> no worries, here it is again jhung: your changes look good to me. One question - I noticed you\'re not using the variables (i.e. "categoryHref" & "defaultPage") in the index.html.md.handlebars file in the way that you are in the header.html.handlebars file - is there a reason for that? should we be consistent?
2016-07-18T19:44:06 <jhung> danayo: the index is slightly different because we\'re adding descriptions along side the icons. We could automate that as well, it would require us to move the descriptions into the site-structure.json file or create a handlebars helper. For now I think it\'s okay the way it is.
2016-07-18T19:48:53 <danayo> jhung, i was just thinking about the link reference itself ( <a href="/practices/Collaborate.html"> )

2016-07-18T19:57:05 <danayo> jhung, I think I lost you again there - was just saying that I was thinking specifically about the link references ( <a href="/practices/Collaborate.html"> ) - whether we could use the variables there
2016-07-18T19:59:35 <jhung> danayo: we wouldn\'t be able to do that because we\'re not iterating through the site-structure the same way we do with the tabs. So for now the index just uses hard coded URLs.
2016-07-18T20:01:14 <danayo> ah, cool jhung, thanks. and thanks for asking me to review your changes. I feel like I may be learning a thing or two :)
2016-07-18T20:01:46 <jhung> :D
2016-07-18T20:05:03 <jessm> alanharnum: google maps seems to avoid it by just labeling the beach triangle :P
