2016-08-02T19:39:42 <jhung> hey Jess_ I'm trying to figure out the styling issues for the Design Guide on mobile. What phone and OS version are you using?
2016-08-02T19:39:59 <Jess_> jhung: crappy :P hold on let me look
2016-08-02T19:41:49 <Jess_> maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s the issue \xe2\x80\x94 can it be reproduced? i\xe2\x80\x99m running ios 8.3 it looks like\xe2\x80\xa6 on an iphone 5S
2016-08-02T19:42:44 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-08-02T19:43:30 <Jess_> another person reported having issues on his mobile, but i didn\xe2\x80\x99t get his os or phone type
2016-08-02T19:43:35 <Jess_> it looks good on an ipad
2016-08-02T19:45:47 <colinclark> I think we've got lots of text layout issues right now on small screens
2016-08-02T19:45:56 <colinclark> things that aren't exactly broken, but are sub-optimal
2016-08-02T19:46:09 <colinclark> and which we can fix with some additional design ideas and some media queries
2016-08-02T19:46:25 <colinclark> My impression is that we should focus for now on iOS 9 and design for that
2016-08-02T19:46:36 <colinclark> then fix any outliers we find on older versions
2016-08-02T19:49:21 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-08-02T19:51:02 <colinclark> Start with making sure we can linearize multiple columns when we run out of horizonal screen real estate
2016-08-02T19:51:18 <colinclark> either by collapsing the navigation panel or making it smaller and placing it at the end of the page
2016-08-02T19:51:47 <colinclark> reducing the margins on call-out boxes and and the like so that we're more efficiently using the horizontal screen real estate when it's limited
2016-08-02T19:52:34 <colinclark> those two things will massively improve the site on phones, and should be readily doable
2016-08-02T19:52:38 <colinclark> then later we can figure out how to work around SVG quirks on older versions of Safari
2016-08-02T19:55:09 <colinclark> jhung: Does that seem like a reasonable approach to you?
2016-08-02T20:01:16 <jhung> colinclark: sorry missed your message. I was deep in thought into how to make the sidebar better for these sites. But yeah, I agree. There are lots off little fixes we can do to make it a little better (text size, margins etc).
2016-08-02T20:01:55 <jhung> If there's time I'd like to rethink how the topics sidebar is done and the hamburger menu.
2016-08-02T20:07:43 <colinclark> that makes sense
2016-08-02T20:08:03 <colinclark> there's time\xe2\x80\x94I think making the guide work beautifully on mobile is a high priority
