2016-03-15T18:44:51 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, please let me know when would be a good time for you to meet regarding the design guides.
2016-03-15T18:52:37 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi, in about 1/2 hour?
2016-03-15T18:52:53 <sepidehshahi> sounds great. thanks danayo
2016-03-15T19:15:15 <danayo> sepidehshahi: ready?
2016-03-15T19:15:30 <sepidehshahi> can I  have 5 min?
2016-03-15T19:15:39 <danayo> sure
2016-03-15T20:32:37 <sepidehshahi> danayo: you were right. we have a problem with space both on the front and the back of the cards\xe2\x80\xa6 what if I make them larger? right now they are 5 x 7.5. we could make them half of a letter size paper 5.5 x 8.5. Or I can make the font size a little bit smaller
2016-03-15T20:34:09 <danayo> let's go with 5.5 X 8.5 for now sepidehshahi
2016-03-15T20:34:20 <sepidehshahi> ok, thanks danayo
2016-03-15T20:34:34 <danayo> we can decide later if we want to make them smaller and edit the content
2016-03-15T20:34:47 <sepidehshahi> ok
