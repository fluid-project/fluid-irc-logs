2016-03-09T15:37:34 <sepidehshahi> good morning danayo:) I was trying the voice over with our website IA map in google draw. Were you able to have it read the text inside the text boxes? for me it just says empty text field although there is text in there.

2016-03-09T15:51:05 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi, I think it was reading the text, but I can\'t remember, will try it again
2016-03-09T15:51:28 <danayo> I may not have actually tried that
2016-03-09T15:51:39 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo. probabely I am missing a step pr a shortcut
2016-03-09T15:52:05 <danayo> yeah probably you have to enter the text field somehow

2016-03-09T15:54:10 <danayo> have you seen this sepidehshahi https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6058689
2016-03-09T15:54:42 <danayo> I\'m not sure how helpful it is :)
2016-03-09T15:54:54 <sepidehshahi> no danayo. thanks for sharing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into it and hopefully find a solution
2016-03-09T16:03:35 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-03-09T16:07:03 <sepidehshahi> danayo: unfortunately I had no luck\xe2\x80\xa6 I tried chrome and firefox, chrome says it\xe2\x80\x99s busy and firefox says the field is empty. maybe we should tag the text with something. Which type of visuals did you test with voice over in google draw?
2016-03-09T16:09:24 <danayo> sepidehshahi: do you see the Accessibility option in the google draw Toolbar?
2016-03-09T16:11:19 <danayo> command/alt/z will turn it on sepidehshahi
2016-03-09T16:11:26 <danayo> https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6282736
2016-03-09T16:11:43 <sepidehshahi> yes I tried that
2016-03-09T16:12:48 <danayo> when I land on a text box in google draw it reads out the colour as well as the content
2016-03-09T16:13:45 <danayo> I think maybe I first had to go to Accessibility and select speak / speak selection
2016-03-09T16:14:27 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo. yes that was the trick I guess. it\xe2\x80\x99s working now and reads out the textbox content:)
2016-03-09T16:15:07 <danayo> ah good!
2016-03-09T16:15:19 <danayo> it\'s a bit strange sepidehshahi
2016-03-09T16:15:31 <danayo> it seems you only have to do that once, but it\'s not clear that it\'s a toggle
2016-03-09T16:15:51 <danayo> in fact i don\'t think it\'s meant to be, but something a bit buggy happens
2016-03-09T16:15:59 <sepidehshahi> yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo
2016-03-09T16:22:23 <sepidehshahi> danayo the other inetersting point, which is relevant to mindmaps is that, the screen reader follows the exact order that you have created your chart pieces initially. So if you have not created everything in the right order, the screen reader keeps jumpping around. (e.g. I usually draw text boxes first and then connect them with an arrow, so it reads: textbox > textbox> arrow instead of textbox > arrow > text box) again maybe
2016-03-09T16:22:24 <sepidehshahi> there is a way to define order. but overall it works fine
2016-03-09T16:24:26 <danayo> yes sepidehshahi, I noticed that too.
2016-03-09T16:25:41 <danayo> I think the only way to reorder things by using Arrange ? it would be nice if there were some way to reorder overall
2016-03-09T16:25:46 <danayo> sepidehshahi^
2016-03-09T16:26:47 <sepidehshahi> interesting danayo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it to see how it works.

2016-03-09T16:58:54 <danayo> sepidehshahi what do you think about adding a link back to the main guidelines page from each individual page? I don\'t think there\'s any other easy way to get back, is there? like so: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Integrated_solutions
2016-03-09T16:59:48 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea danayo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll add that link to all the pages
2016-03-09T17:00:41 <danayo> thanks! also, if I make any minor edits to content that\'s already transferred over, I\'m adding the edits to the wiki as well. as I do so I can also add the link back to main page sepidehshahi
2016-03-09T17:01:09 <sepidehshahi> perfect. thanks danayo
2016-03-09T17:02:01 <danayo> oh, also sepidehshahi, can we change the name of the main page to "Inclusive Design Guildelines for Good Practice"? I can\'t see how to edit the title
2016-03-09T17:03:05 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to do that. I can try
2016-03-09T17:11:41 <sepidehshahi> danayo: it is moved (renamed): https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Inclusive_Design_Guildelines_for_Good_Practice
2016-03-09T17:13:01 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi

2016-03-09T22:27:09 <danayo> right, I deleted it sepidehshahi, meant to tell you
2016-03-09T22:27:19 <danayo> it\'s covered under Design for Adaptability and Flexibility
2016-03-09T22:27:27 <danayo> and seemed not to fit as a separate practice
2016-03-09T22:28:01 <sepidehshahi> cool. makes sense. we have it under some of the related practices for principles. I\xe2\x80\x99ll clean that up in the wiki tomorrow
