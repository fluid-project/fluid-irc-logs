2016-03-29T15:04:53 <sepidehshahi> Hi amatas, I was wondering if you could help us fix some of the problems that GPII wiki has. We have updated several PNG and JPEG images, however, the thumbnails are still showing the older versions. You can find an example of this issue by selecting one of the thumbnails on this page: https://wiki.gpii.net/index.php?title=Inclusive_Design_Guidelines&redirect=no
2016-03-29T15:05:28 <amatas> sepidehshahi, let me take a look
2016-03-29T15:05:57 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2016-03-29T15:13:17 <amatas> sepidehshahi, I've gone over all the thumbnails of the page  https://wiki.gpii.net/index.php?title=Inclusive_Design_Guidelines and it seems that all thumbnails correspond to the larger version of the images
2016-03-29T15:14:33 <amatas> may be a cache issue? have you tried to refresh the page with ctrl+F5?
2016-03-29T15:14:45 <sepidehshahi> amatas: that\xe2\x80\x99s right, but if you double click on the larger version of the images, you will see the final version of that image in the preview which is different than the thumbnail as well as the larger version of the image.
2016-03-29T15:15:17 <amatas> oh wow
2016-03-29T15:15:18 <amatas> I see
2016-03-29T15:15:31 <amatas> you're right
2016-03-29T15:15:57 <sepidehshahi> do you think if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to fix this problem?
2016-03-29T15:17:29 <amatas> I'll check the files at the server
2016-03-29T15:17:40 <sepidehshahi> great. thanks amatas
