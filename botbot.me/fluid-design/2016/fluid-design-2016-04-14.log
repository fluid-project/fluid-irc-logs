2016-04-14T14:29:38 <alanharnum> sepidshahi danayo: should we check in quickly about user testing?
2016-04-14T14:30:41 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi danayo: i\'ve unlocked my vido room
2016-04-14T14:31:26 <danayo> be right there alanharnum
2016-04-14T15:14:39 <jhung> alanharnum, danayo, sepidehshahi: I\'m overhearing your conversation and that\'s something we\'ve examined for the work on PhET (i.e. remote user testing).
2016-04-14T15:15:05 <alanharnum> cool jhung - have you found or done anything that worked well?
2016-04-14T15:19:11 <jhung> alanharnum: there are solutions available that address this, but they call require $$$. Ron Owston from York U was working on a project called Open VULab that was to enable remote user testing, but that project appears to be over?
2016-04-14T15:21:30 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-04-14T15:22:40 <danayo> jhung, alanharnum: someone from Simply Accessible (Joanna Briggs) mentioned that they do a lot of remote usability testing - she mentioned it at the Meetup - I\'ll follow up with her to ask how they do it
2016-04-14T15:23:02 <danayo> I don\'t think they\'re testing sonification though :)
2016-04-14T15:53:03 <jhung> danayo: yeah I\'d be interested in hearing what they use.

2016-04-14T16:15:15 <danayo> :)
2016-04-14T16:15:22 <danayo> and your opinion is ... ?
2016-04-14T16:18:02 <jhung> \xe2\x80\xa6
2016-04-14T16:18:08 * jhung speechless
2016-04-14T16:19:43 <danayo> :D
2016-04-14T16:19:46 <jhung> It\'s very unclear how information is organized. I\'m not even sure how to even begin to use it danayo.
2016-04-14T16:19:57 <danayo> yes, my thoughts were the same jhung
2016-04-14T16:23:47 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-04-14T16:24:44 <danayo> it\'s too bad jhung, it seems like it might have some decent features, but it\'s structure and interface are so hard to understand / use
2016-04-14T16:28:29 <danayo> jhung I was hoping to log into the OwnCloud account that I set up some time ago, but it seems like maybe it\'s is not active any more. do you know if we\'re still hosting our own version of it? Looks like gtirloni is offline right now
2016-04-14T16:28:57 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-04-14T16:30:32 <gtirloni> danayo: hi, yeah, i\'ve removed that environment after a few weeks. are you guys still considering owncloud?
2016-04-14T16:30:48 <danayo> ah, hello gtirloni!
2016-04-14T16:30:53 <danayo> yes, we are
2016-04-14T16:31:28 <danayo> a few of us have tried out ResourceSpace, but find it less-than-fun to use
2016-04-14T16:31:47 <danayo> we were thinking of using OwnCloud to solve at least our immediate storage problem
2016-04-14T16:32:06 <jhung> gtirloni: if you can spin up OwnCloud again that would be great. We\'re thinking of it to give use some storage until we can find a solution for design assets.
2016-04-14T16:35:02 <gtirloni> sure, no problem. can we establish a trial period, say, 2 weeks? i\'d like to avoid having this rotting without proper maintenance (which involves automating the deployment, security fixes, etc)
2016-04-14T16:43:53 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-14T16:54:31 <jhung> gtirloni: I\'d be curious to get your thoughts about what is involved in maintaining this.
2016-04-14T16:54:56 <jhung> Useful information to know when making decisions.
2016-04-14T16:56:09 <gtirloni> we need a large storage area, properly backed up. we also need to create an ansible role to install owncloud and do the php/database configuration (and figure out how it\'s updated without breaking things)
2016-04-14T16:57:08 <gtirloni> for the trial i created back in february, i just ran an ephemeral container with local storage, no backups no automation, and that was it
2016-04-14T16:58:03 <gtirloni> just to clarify, do you need a real/production owncloud installation or are we still talking about a environment for experimenting?
2016-04-14T16:58:13 <gtirloni> are you planning to store files right away?
2016-04-14T16:58:49 <gtirloni> (important files, that is)
2016-04-14T17:17:44 <danayo> gtirloni, jhung, we will store files right away, but I imagine we\'ll keep backup copies ourselves
2016-04-14T17:19:23 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2016-04-14T17:20:36 <danayo> and we really need to solve our storage problem soon. but i\'m not entirely sure of the answer to your question. Justin_o do you have any thoughts?

2016-04-14T18:37:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i think the plan is to move from dropbox quickly, as they are out of space
2016-04-14T18:37:51 <Justin_o> quickly meaning soon
2016-04-14T18:38:15 <jhung> gtirloni: but if it requires a lot of extra work, then perhaps we can consider just moving older files to the CDN.
2016-04-14T18:38:46 <gtirloni> it\'ll take a couple of weeks i\'m guessing
2016-04-14T18:39:38 <jhung> ok gtirloni. That\'s good information. Could you reply to the thread on the mailing list re: "Repository for design artifacts"?
2016-04-14T18:40:08 <Justin_o> gtirloni: what are your thoughts on a url shortening service
2016-04-14T18:41:19 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i was talking to jhung about that for links to things like artifacts in dropbox and OwnCloud so that we could manage migrations easier. Jon had a good idea of leaving current items in dropbox, but we might want this if we switch to OwnCloud so that we don\'t have to keep managing the service indefinitely
2016-04-14T18:42:49 <gtirloni> jhung: will do
2016-04-14T18:43:05 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-04-14T18:43:23 * alanharnum has quit
2016-04-14T18:43:25 <gtirloni> Justin_o: sounds like a good idea. i don\'t know about any open source url shortening service, but there must exist something out there. we\'d need to do some research. it should have a way of editing and organizing the links
2016-04-14T18:44:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay cool thanks
2016-04-14T18:46:03 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-04-14T18:47:58 <gtirloni> i will bring a new trial instance of owncloud, i\'ll reply to that thread
2016-04-14T18:49:10 <danayo> thanks gtirloni
2016-04-14T18:54:40 <gtirloni> it seems google offers "google apps for education" which include unlimited google drive storage
2016-04-14T18:55:12 <gtirloni> i don\'t know if ocad would have to request it, or if the idrc could do that directly. they would likely require proof of legal status
2016-04-14T18:59:59 <gtirloni> jhung Justin_o danayo: does it make sense to call this owncloud instance "idrc\'s" or "fluid\'s" ...
2016-04-14T19:00:28 <Justin_o> gtirloni: the google apps could be a decent alternative
2016-04-14T19:00:34 <Justin_o> if we can have access to it
2016-04-14T19:01:11 <gtirloni> Justin_o: google apps would be sweet. is the idrc a legal entity by itself or a internal dept inside ocad? i don\'t know how google would view it
2016-04-14T19:03:01 <jhung> gtirloni: maybe IDRC\'s, although right now we\'re primarily using it for Fluid related work.
2016-04-14T19:03:19 <gtirloni> jhung: ok thanks
2016-04-14T19:04:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i think the IDRC is a legal not-for-profit organization, but maybe check with Iris for the details on that
2016-04-14T19:05:22 <gtirloni> ok
