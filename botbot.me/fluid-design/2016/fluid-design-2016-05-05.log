2016-05-05T18:29:52 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: and danayo how do you feel about the paper? I can start reviewing it from the start or is there anything else I could help with? when do you think we can start transferimg it to the template?
2016-05-05T18:30:35 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: I was thinking (colinclark, thoughts?) that we should do a final review and then transfer to the template tomorrow
2016-05-05T18:30:41 <alanharnum> given tomorrow is the actual deadline
2016-05-05T18:31:07 * clown joined the channel
2016-05-05T18:31:10 <sepidehshahi> sure alanharnum
2016-05-05T18:31:47 <alanharnum> some pieces are still a bit roughed in or have notes, which we\'ll need to clean up
2016-05-05T18:32:06 <alanharnum> but overall looking pretty good imo
2016-05-05T18:34:56 <danayo> sepidehshahi alanharnum colinclark I\'ve gone through and revised/added to the intro and Phase I Method, getting through Phase I Results now and will then go through Phase II
2016-05-05T18:35:18 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot danayo
2016-05-05T18:42:49 <colinclark> awesome!
2016-05-05T18:47:38 <jessm> jhung: ping
2016-05-05T18:56:12 <danayo> sepidehshahi: do you think we should describe some of the other sonifications we tried that we did not end up testing?
2016-05-05T18:56:24 <danayo> I think it might be useful to at least summarise them
2016-05-05T18:57:44 <sepidehshahi> I was thinking about that yesterday danayo. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea and we should do that.
2016-05-05T18:58:21 <sepidehshahi> most of the different sonifications we have built somehow fit into these four category. which ones do you imagin describing?
2016-05-05T19:04:25 <danayo> sepidehshahi: looking at this page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Pie+Chart+Sound+Sketches
2016-05-05T19:04:38 <danayo> thinking of some of the things we tried  e..g diff ways of stacking
2016-05-05T19:04:51 <danayo> also, that one at the bottom of the pencil sketch (#5)
2016-05-05T19:05:14 <danayo> we tried using bells to indicate breaks between segments ...
2016-05-05T19:05:25 <danayo> we tried putting the legend up front
2016-05-05T19:05:59 <danayo> we tried using a "backdrop" sound
2016-05-05T19:06:13 <danayo> maybe a few other things?
2016-05-05T19:07:25 * Yan_Hu has left the channel
2016-05-05T19:08:32 <sepidehshahi> for some of them we can include them in the higher category as differnt variations. for example different stacking could all be included in the 4th category and we chose the right stacking as a representative. The backdrop sound is also part of the durational one, so we can add to that category and say in some sketches the 100% was audible or a metronome sound was added for ease of counting.
2016-05-05T19:09:45 <sepidehshahi> one of the new things we can talk about, as you mentioned, is the diffrent ways we integrated the legend, or added bell sounds as an identifier.
2016-05-05T19:10:30 <sepidehshahi> the other approach we didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention but somehow used in the beeps was the intensity or frequency of beeps in a fixed duration
2016-05-05T19:11:54 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, I hadn\'t been thinking of them as more general categories, so my descriptions were getting pretty specific, I can rework them to be more general
2016-05-05T19:12:10 <jhung> hey jessm.
2016-05-05T19:12:26 <danayo> and yeah, i think we did a good bit of work on exploring the "density" of the beeps
2016-05-05T19:12:50 <sepidehshahi> danayo: in phase I i describe them as more generic categories and in phase II I describe those specific representatives we chose from each category
2016-05-05T19:13:15 <danayo> cool
2016-05-05T19:19:26 <jessm> hey jhung, do you have some time to help some folks with UIO and WP? i know you\xe2\x80\x99ve had your head in WP lately
2016-05-05T19:19:53 <jessm> JT sent along an email from the tangled gallery that simonjb mentioned in an email earlier this week. they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to integrate the plugin and having issues
2016-05-05T19:25:25 <jhung> jessm: ok. I might be able to help. alanharnum may have some thoughts too since the UIO WP plugin is on his plate now.
2016-05-05T19:25:28 <jessm> jhung: ^
2016-05-05T19:28:13 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-05-05T19:31:08 <jessm> jhung: nevermind. colinclark just emailed michelled so i think if you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it, then michelled will get back to you
2016-05-05T19:32:19 <colinclark> I\'ll forward it to you, jhung
2016-05-05T19:33:00 <colinclark> sorry, I should have copied you
2016-05-05T19:34:37 <jhung> ok colinclark
2016-05-05T19:40:47 <alanharnum> forward to me as well colinclark?
2016-05-05T19:41:02 <colinclark> sure
2016-05-05T19:41:30 <alanharnum> ty
2016-05-05T19:47:44 <jessm> michelled: i can\xe2\x80\x99t find the P4A reporting doc template that you had shared with me in dropbox i think. can you resend a link?
2016-05-05T19:48:04 <michelled> maybe google docs, jess?
2016-05-05T19:48:13 <jessm> hrm, could be \xe2\x80\x94 i looked there too
2016-05-05T19:49:36 <michelled> jessm: do you mean this? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12EgWDvbWeclnCIG3LGRfWgJI2mL3-mHmFjGD656ooL8/edit#gid=324883286
2016-05-05T19:50:19 <jessm> yes! i can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find that in my drive
2016-05-05T19:51:19 <jessm> thanks

2016-05-05T20:19:52 <jessm> michelled: one more link! to the rainbow planning doc
2016-05-05T20:20:31 <michelled> which one jess? the IDRC deliverables? or the team work doc?
2016-05-05T20:20:41 <jessm> the former
2016-05-05T20:20:53 <michelled> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I3LVD6POLHBOqualvL6GaZedGZpPzkoYmjWVHIphz2c/edit#gid=1458811961
2016-05-05T20:20:54 <jessm> are they both linked somewhere in the wiki?
2016-05-05T20:21:17 <michelled> no, they aren\'t really in shape for public consumption, jessm - they are my personal planning docs
2016-05-05T20:21:25 <michelled> and subject to change
2016-05-05T20:21:45 <michelled> the results of them are in the interation plan page that we collaboratively manage

2016-05-05T20:52:24 <danayo> can\'t seem to find it
2016-05-05T20:52:50 <danayo> actually, i got it
2016-05-05T20:53:02 <danayo> :)
2016-05-05T20:53:14 <danayo> realised I could just search under your name
2016-05-05T20:54:07 <danayo> but would be good if we could link it from the parent page
2016-05-05T20:55:42 <sepidehshahi> :)
2016-05-05T20:56:03 <sepidehshahi> or seach by flowers, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have flowers any where else;)
