2016-11-22T15:20:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks for merging my https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/788
2016-11-22T15:20:50 <Bosmon> Are we sure this was right, given we are in code freeze?
2016-11-22T15:21:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: that\'s what I\'m not sure about :(
2016-11-22T15:23:03 <michelled> cindyli, Bosmon: I would think we should pull that back out. I think a change to the framework would trigger a need for major testing again
2016-11-22T15:23:06 <michelled> and we are so close .....
2016-11-22T15:24:16 <Bosmon> Well, personally I think it is fine, since there are no calls to that method anywhere within Infusion
2016-11-22T15:24:20 <Bosmon> But I thought I should check in
2016-11-22T15:25:39 <michelled> Justin_o: I suppose this is your call
2016-11-22T15:43:29 <Bosmon> Oh, I see now I was in the wrong channel, sorry
2016-11-22T15:46:28 <colinclark> Bosmon, michelled, Justin_o: This seems like a pretty simple situation to me
2016-11-22T15:46:40 <colinclark> The function that was modified has no call sites outside of the unit tests
2016-11-22T15:46:54 <colinclark> so assuming the unit tests run, and a basic smoke test for errors passes, we\'re fine
2016-11-22T15:55:55 <Jess_> hey, jhung1 that design \xe2\x80\x9cjob\xe2\x80\x9d in the crit was fun \xe2\x80\x94 you made test descriptions fun!
2016-11-22T15:56:15 <jhung1> Just wait until next week Jess_! :)
2016-11-22T15:56:25 <Jess_> ohhhhhhhh
2016-11-22T15:56:53 <jhung1> "so hype!" is what I think the youths would say.
2016-11-22T15:57:46 <avtar> jhung1: i don\'t think they say that anymore
2016-11-22T15:58:05 <Jess_> avtar: \xe2\x80\x9cwicked cool?\xe2\x80\x9d
2016-11-22T15:58:11 <avtar> http://www.mtv.com/news/2720889/teen-slang-2016/
2016-11-22T15:58:55 <avtar> i thought "fire" was still in but clearly that\'s dated as well
2016-11-22T15:59:18 <jhung1> avtar: are you sure? I just learned that one last week! :(
2016-11-22T15:59:23 <jhung1> now I can\'t use it?
2016-11-22T15:59:29 <Jess_> and now we have to have animated gifs too?!
2016-11-22T15:59:55 <avtar> jhung1: i don\'t make the rules, just passively observing
2016-11-22T16:01:09 <jhung1> avtar: I give up. I\'ll stick with my dated slang.
2016-11-22T16:01:33 <gtirloni_> I\'m sure "swell" is a thing now
2016-11-22T16:01:47 <gtirloni_> It\'s like fashion.. every 30y it\'s back
2016-11-22T16:01:51 <Jess_> gtirloni: <sigh>
2016-11-22T16:01:58 <gtirloni_> ;)
2016-11-22T16:02:29 <avtar> jon took that pretty hard :/
2016-11-22T16:02:35 <Jess_> lol
2016-11-22T16:20:00 <Justin_o> colinclark, michelled, Bosmon, cindyli: I think we can make leaving the merged code in.
2016-11-22T16:20:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you please review the Infusion-Docs PR that Cindy made for that change. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/106
2016-11-22T16:20:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, will do
2016-11-22T16:22:40 <Bosmon> I\'m so glad I have an IRC client that is immune to the last 30 years of fashion and simply renders these eccentric characters as black squares :)
2016-11-22T16:26:42 <Justin_o> are you getting everything as black squares?
2016-11-22T16:26:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o - only the cool characters :)
2016-11-22T16:27:26 <Justin_o> haha
