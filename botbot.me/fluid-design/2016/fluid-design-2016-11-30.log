2016-11-30T20:15:54 <lliskovoi> I'm working with the files on OwnCloud
2016-11-30T20:16:00 <lliskovoi> I'm saving them as copies at the moment
2016-11-30T20:19:07 <danayo> ok lliskovoi - just wanted to avoid overwriting, so that sounds good
2016-11-30T20:19:27 <danayo> let me know if the Insights and Activities looks ok to you
2016-11-30T20:19:41 <danayo> i just resized those image in Activities a bit to fit within crop
2016-11-30T20:19:43 <lliskovoi> I've been putting them in a folder within the IDRC print folder
2016-11-30T20:23:46 <danayo> ok lliskovoi

2016-11-30T20:30:47 <lliskovoi> michelled1: ^
2016-11-30T20:31:03 <michelled1> thx lliskovoi - probably best to reply all to that email thread
2016-11-30T20:31:17 <michelled1> and please add Iris to it since she'll have to give sign off
2016-11-30T20:32:21 <lliskovoi> sure michelled1, anyone else?
2016-11-30T20:33:53 <michelled1> everyone on that thread is good lliskovoi

2016-11-30T20:47:47 <lliskovoi> thanks danayo, I'm working on it right now, almost done
2016-11-30T20:47:52 <danayo> great

2016-11-30T16:00:36 <Justin_o> jhung: you also might be interested in this https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/drum-machine/view/ in relation to the sonification generator
2016-11-30T16:04:35 <jhung> Interesting Justin_o. It\'d be cool to be able to assign sounds in a sim by choosing it from a map kind of like this. Perhaps on 4 axis like: percussion to melodic on X, and synthesized and real-world on Y.
2016-11-30T16:05:29 <Justin_o> jhung: i don\'t know enough to know if that would work, but seems like a good idea
2016-11-30T16:06:26 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah just thinking in terms of customizability. It\'d be cool to allow users to choose from a spectrum. The authoring and personalization tool may look the same.

2016-11-30T16:15:31 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-11-30T16:17:08 <danayo> jhung Justin_o they have some interesting filters you can use too
2016-11-30T16:17:14 <danayo> quite a long list
2016-11-30T16:17:22 <danayo> if you select the filter search field
2016-11-30T16:17:31 <Justin_o> i didn\'t understand what the filters did
2016-11-30T16:17:52 <danayo> you have to select the shuffle button once you\'ve selected a filter Justin_o
2016-11-30T16:17:59 <danayo> it automatically selects
2016-11-30T16:18:04 <danayo> according to the filter
2016-11-30T16:18:11 <danayo> otherwise I think it randomly selects from all
2016-11-30T16:18:20 <Justin_o> oh okay
2016-11-30T16:18:30 <danayo> yeah, not obvious
2016-11-30T16:23:02 * Bosmon6 joined the channel
2016-11-30T16:47:19 <jhung> danayo: how about "sampling"?
2016-11-30T16:48:41 <danayo> not sure jhung, that  kind of makes me think of a medical context, or traditional lab science
2016-11-30T16:49:22 <danayo> i guess we were thinking of a personal collection of things or data
2016-11-30T16:49:49 <jhung> danayo: true.
2016-11-30T16:50:32 <jhung> danayo: I\'ve also seen profiling being used without that word, but describing it in terms of its results. Like "Trending", "You may also like\xe2\x80\xa6" etc.
2016-11-30T16:51:59 <danayo> yeah jhung, the trend or pattern is the thing that would be identified (hopefully) by the user, but the act of collecting is what colinclark and I were discussing
2016-11-30T16:52:12 <alanharnum> things that say to me "personal collection of things or data": diaries, scrapbooks, logs, journals
2016-11-30T16:52:20 <danayo> but i can see simonjb\'s point about the use of that word in the past
2016-11-30T16:52:24 <alanharnum> "logging" or "journaling" might have better connotations
2016-11-30T16:52:26 <danayo> re: collecting data
2016-11-30T16:52:48 <danayo> alanharnum: logging is interesting
2016-11-30T16:55:34 <alanharnum> "recording" might also have better connotations? not sure
2016-11-30T17:04:01 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-11-30T17:07:24 <Justin_o> danayo: i was going to suggest "following" which is sort of the term you see a lot when you "stalk" your friends online through social media, and seems to be a somewhat acceptable term. but i like alanharnum\'s selections too
2016-11-30T17:09:20 <danayo> interesting Justin_o. following data vs. following people (or following sites/pages) would be a bit of a shift or expansion of the usual meaning, but I think that could work
2016-11-30T17:10:22 <colinclark> My use of the term was in the context of examples like "stamp collecting," "my collection of synthesizers," "a collection of thoughts," "collecting seashells," "collecting evidence of systemic bias," "collecting feedback," etc.
2016-11-30T17:10:31 <colinclark> it\'s definitely a doubled term, as everything is :)

2016-11-30T18:01:04 <gtirloni> let me check
2016-11-30T18:02:10 <jhung> thanks
2016-11-30T18:02:12 <alanharnum> i suspect others are aware of this, but since I hadn\'t seen it: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2016OctDec/0135.html
2016-11-30T18:02:25 <alanharnum> WCAG 2.0 has been very successful and has provided better access to the
2016-11-30T18:02:25 <alanharnum> web for people with disabilities than was available in the past. At
2016-11-30T18:02:25 <alanharnum> eight years old, WCAG 2.0 is ready for a major update. We know that
2016-11-30T18:02:27 <alanharnum> involving more people, robust feedback, and a thoughtful process we can
2016-11-30T18:02:29 <alanharnum> improve access for people with disabilities further and provide a clear
2016-11-30T18:02:31 <alanharnum> and usable standard. We want to hear from a broad, international set of
2016-11-30T18:02:33 <alanharnum> stakeholders, we want to hear from you!
2016-11-30T18:02:35 <alanharnum> "
2016-11-30T18:03:21 <gtirloni> jhung: yep, commits should trigger deployments. github has not notified us yet about that though (just checked the logs)
2016-11-30T18:05:02 <jhung> gtirloni: ok. I\'ll watch the site and see if it eventually happens.

2016-11-30T18:41:11 <michelled> nope jhung
2016-11-30T18:41:21 <michelled> I\'ve cleared all my history and restarted the browser
2016-11-30T18:41:49 <michelled> oh wait - sorry jhung I figured those would have been under recent events
2016-11-30T18:42:05 <michelled> I do see your changes - I think we should mention this years DEEP in recent events
2016-11-30T18:42:08 <jhung> michelled: ah.
2016-11-30T18:42:10 <michelled> it\'s weird to see 2015 there
2016-11-30T18:42:53 <michelled> jhung: or we could collapse the two sections? what do you think?
2016-11-30T18:42:56 <jhung> yeah. I think we should remove the Recent events section for now until we have items.
2016-11-30T18:43:23 <michelled> well, we do have items
2016-11-30T18:43:27 <michelled> meaning, DEEP was an event
2016-11-30T18:43:33 <michelled> it might also be news
2016-11-30T18:43:49 <jhung> Yeah. I think we should just have News for now.
2016-11-30T18:44:10 <michelled> sounds fine to me!
2016-11-30T18:44:12 <jhung> Next time if we have events in the future we want to share, we\'ll bring back the Events section
2016-11-30T18:44:18 <jhung> ok
