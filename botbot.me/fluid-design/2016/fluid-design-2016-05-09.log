2016-05-09T14:13:58 <danayo> michelled, colinclark: did we do some work with benetech on metadata/schema.org ?
2016-05-09T14:14:06 <colinclark> yep
2016-05-09T14:14:11 <colinclark> we certainly did
2016-05-09T14:14:36 <colinclark> The accessibility metadata portion of schema.org is based entirely on AccessForAll/ISO 24751
2016-05-09T14:14:51 <colinclark> and Anastasia and I were on the committee that drafted the schema.org additions
2016-05-09T14:14:57 <colinclark> which Benetech got some funding to organize
2016-05-09T14:23:49 <danayo> thanks colinclark, I was pretty sure but couldn't recall any details

2016-05-09T14:37:25 <sepidehshahi> Hi lliskovoi, I was wondering if you had any experience with Google Forms. I am trying to use that to build a survey and I wanted to make sure it is accessible. Some of our other P4A partenrs have already used it for their surveys.
2016-05-09T14:38:04 * jhung joined the channel
2016-05-09T14:38:09 <lliskovoi> sepidehshahi I've never used it, but I'd be happy to take a look to see how accessible it is
2016-05-09T14:38:11 <sepidehshahi> here is a sample lliskovoi https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CpnbDTVRulD1sv_ZXu0LURPz4MSNQamzyHy_DyviD34/viewform?c=0&w=1
2016-05-09T14:38:32 <sepidehshahi> that would be really helpful and thanks a lot
2016-05-09T14:47:33 <sepidehshahi> lliskovoi: it seems that we need to either have a business domain or pay a monthly fee to be able to use Google Forms services. In that case, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to use this tool. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at it already, please don\xe2\x80\x99t spend any time on this. Thanks a lot again:)
2016-05-09T14:48:05 <lliskovoi> oh, that's too bad
2016-05-09T14:48:18 <lliskovoi> it's quite good
2016-05-09T14:48:30 <lliskovoi> sepidehshahi ^
2016-05-09T14:49:03 <sepidehshahi> oh that\xe2\x80\x99s too bad...
2016-05-09T14:49:50 <lliskovoi> well, it's not perfect, so maybe there are even better tools out there
2016-05-09T14:56:52 <lliskovoi> speidehshahi, I know you've used survey monkey before, have your run into issues with that one? I want to send out a short survey regarding the new website and was considering using it.

2016-05-09T14:59:30 <lliskovoi> sepidehshahi, ^ had a typo in your name in the comment above
2016-05-09T15:01:06 <sepidehshahi> lliskovoi: That is really good tool if you have less than 10 questions. Heidi did an accessibility review of that and sent me some comments that I can forward to you. This time we need another tool since we have almost 30 questions. But for short surveys I totally recommend it.
2016-05-09T15:01:45 <sepidehshahi> just to let you know, for free accounts, you can have 10 questions, no more than 100 responses and also no access to data analysis features or export reponses as PDF
2016-05-09T15:01:50 <sepidehshahi> lliskovoi: ^
2016-05-09T15:02:40 <lliskovoi> sepidehshahi awesome, the one I want to send out is super simple and should only be about 3 questions, to that sounds perfect, thanks!
2016-05-09T15:32:29 <lliskovoi> hey everyone, I want to send out a quick survey that would help guide my thinking when creating the new IDRC site mockups. I've narrowed it down to five questions (see below). Would love to hear your thoughts/comments.
2016-05-09T15:32:46 <lliskovoi> 1.\tIf a site visitor were to take away one point or idea after visiting the IDRC site, what  should it be?
2016-05-09T15:32:46 <lliskovoi> 2.\tList 3 or more words that describe the IDRC to you (e.g. emotions, associations, etc.).
2016-05-09T15:32:46 <lliskovoi> 3.\tWhat emotions would you like the new IDRC site to evoke?
2016-05-09T15:32:47 <lliskovoi> 4.\tProvide 1-2 links to sites that inspire you
2016-05-09T15:32:47 <lliskovoi> 5.\tPlease share any other thoughts or comments. This can include things you would like to see on the new site, things you like/dislike about the current site, etc.

2016-05-09T16:05:29 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-05-09T16:09:45 <danayo> Yan_Hu: are you looking for the latest implemented designs of the PMT, or the latest mockups? They are different. What was implemented was an older version
2016-05-09T16:11:51 <danayo> also, there are a number of different mockups for the PMT: the adjusters, the login sequence, setting contexts, privacy settings - are you interested in something specific? what do you need them for?
2016-05-09T16:12:37 <danayo> Yan_Hu: they're all on the wiki but it's a bit of a mess - I can point you to specific links
2016-05-09T16:12:44 <danayo> still need to clean up that wiki page :D
2016-05-09T17:02:05 <sepidehshahi> danayo: where are we meeting for the design crit?
2016-05-09T17:03:00 <danayo> we're in fluid standup sepidehshahi
