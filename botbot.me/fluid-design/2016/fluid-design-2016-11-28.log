2016-11-28T15:11:11 <alanharnum> danayo: should we meet on dashboard today? I don\'t have any update from my side, have been working on other things.
2016-11-28T15:12:23 <danayo> same goes for me alanharnum. focusing on privacy work today (which we\'ll discuss at crit tomorrow), so perhaps we can have a dashboard checkin next week ?
2016-11-28T15:13:10 <alanharnum> sounds good

2016-11-28T16:01:03 <jhung> jessm: the "otherwise" option I was describing requires some additional work. Currently the automatic print layout doesn\'t output something that\'s friendly for human reading since the cards are rearranged out of order to make it work for duplexing.

2016-11-28T16:07:51 <jessm> jhung: hrm. i just got a reply from Carla that she can wait a week or if it\xe2\x80\x99s messy she can do it. so i\xe2\x80\x99m just going to point her to the new cards on the site \xe2\x80\x94 does that make sense? or should i point her to your sandbox?
2016-11-28T16:08:58 <jhung> The Guide site is good since it has the P4A logo there jessm.
2016-11-28T16:09:08 <jessm> ok
2016-11-28T16:09:20 <jessm> jhung: i\xe2\x80\x99m oging to cc you and danayo on the email
2016-11-28T16:09:28 <jhung> But I wonder if those logos should be more prominent on the index page at least. Maybe closer to the top? danayo thoughts?
2016-11-28T16:12:20 <danayo> i\'m not too keen on having logos at the top - unless it\'s really necessary jhung jessm.
2016-11-28T16:12:45 <danayo> i\'m not sure how she\'s going to add logos to the existing pages - I can send her a link to the pdfs if that would be better
2016-11-28T16:14:48 <jhung> danayo: for now jessm is going to recommend linking to the Guide site since it has a logo already. If that\'s not sufficient I guess you can send her editable PDFs so she can swap the logos herself.
2016-11-28T16:15:51 <michelled> jhung: I think our plan was to have the printable site include logos by February. Do you think that\'s reasonable?
2016-11-28T16:15:57 <michelled> that should be in time for the next review
2016-11-28T16:16:45 <jhung> michelled: yeah. It should be ready for then.
2016-11-28T16:17:20 <danayo> cool jhung
2016-11-28T16:21:22 <jessm> danayo: if it\xe2\x80\x99s easy we can just send her the PDFs

2016-11-28T17:09:24 <danayo> jhung could you take a quick look at these and just see if anything looks off? i replaced the logos in the latest files https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/LrZXuU0wz1vtqfF
2016-11-28T17:18:03 <jhung> looking now danayo
2016-11-28T17:18:11 <danayo> thanks jhung

2016-11-28T18:33:54 <simonjb> by same team as Me and My Shadow
2016-11-28T18:34:02 <danayo> yes simonjb, thanks, michelled1 sent me that this morning - looks really cool
2016-11-28T18:34:08 <simonjb> yeah, it does
2016-11-28T18:34:35 <simonjb> Mozilla also involved
2016-11-28T18:35:08 <danayo> have you tried this simonjb https://myshadow.org/trace-my-shadow ? it seems like a good way to learn/expose what is being tracked etc
2016-11-28T18:36:01 <simonjb> danayo: I\'ve not tried it but will take a look

2016-11-28T18:59:46 <alanharnum> avtar: I believe the third chart on http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/tests/html/lineChartTimeSeries-Tests.html is an example (a step chart) of the kind of chart needed for the CI statistics

2016-11-28T19:20:54 <jhung> jessm: Before you showed up they talked a little about the licensing. They said the article you sent them about CLAs was very useful and they\'re not going to use CLAs right now but some sort of attribution policy.
2016-11-28T19:21:35 <jessm> jhung: uh oh :P i passed along something simonjb and others in IRC were pointing to
2016-11-28T19:22:29 <jhung> jessm: :D Either way they found it useful.
2016-11-28T19:22:39 <jessm> nice!
