2016-05-12T14:34:46 <danayo> hey colinclark, yes, but sepidehshahi and jessm are in an SP1 call
2016-05-12T14:34:50 <danayo> we can meet with neeta
2016-05-12T14:34:59 <colinclark> aha
2016-05-12T14:35:37 <colinclark> when will the SP1 call end?
2016-05-12T14:35:49 <danayo> I don't know - sepidehshahi do you have an idea?
2016-05-12T14:36:11 <sepidehshahi> danayo: and colinclark I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know
2016-05-12T14:36:25 <sepidehshahi> maybe in 15 minutes

2016-05-12T14:40:20 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: and danayo I\xe2\x80\x99m done with the call, jessm is still there. have you started the dashboard meeting?
2016-05-12T14:41:28 <danayo> not yet sepidehshahi, neeta is going to share a mockup iteration with us through google drive, but let's get started
2016-05-12T14:41:56 <sepidehshahi> I have already added her mockup to the owncloud
2016-05-12T14:42:01 <danayo> ah!
2016-05-12T14:42:06 <danayo> I'll let her know

2016-05-12T14:42:38 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ve also added one there
2016-05-12T14:42:41 <danayo> i'm in fluid standup room sepidehshahi, colinclark
2016-05-12T14:42:47 <sepidehshahi> still in progress though

2016-05-12T15:45:02 <colinclark> but i'm thinking it would be cool if i got set up with our owncloud instance
2016-05-12T15:45:03 <gtirloni> hey colin
2016-05-12T15:45:08 <colinclark> are there instructions anywhere for that?

2016-05-12T20:17:48 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I tried to play with differnt variations of how we could customize the building blocks on the dashboard. If you had a chance please have a look and let me know if any of those concepts has the potential for further exploration: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/fjucjHz9sDuYDhQ
2016-05-12T20:18:41 <danayo> great sepidehshahi I'll take a look!
2016-05-12T20:19:13 <sepidehshahi> awesome! thanks danayo. I tried to stay away from visual design so everything looks blocky:)
2016-05-12T20:20:08 <danayo> ok

2016-05-12T20:48:46 <danayo> sepidehshahi: these are great, i think i like #1 and #3 the best
2016-05-12T20:49:01 <danayo> #2 is interesting, but wouldn't allow rearrangement of the blocks
2016-05-12T20:49:19 <danayo> or maybe it could
2016-05-12T20:50:24 <danayo> it's a tough call, #5 is interesting too because i like how it combines the opening of each separate element with the ability to select it
2016-05-12T20:50:31 <danayo> ok, i like them all :)
2016-05-12T20:51:38 <danayo> or at least I can say that #4 is my least favourite. the switches seem to imply something more than appear/disappear
2016-05-12T20:51:59 <danayo> because those elements are still active
2016-05-12T20:52:02 <danayo> even when you can't see them
2016-05-12T20:52:24 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo
2016-05-12T20:53:31 <danayo> I like #3 because the building blocks actually look like blocks
2016-05-12T20:53:55 <danayo> in #3, how do you imagine opening each of those elements separately, or are you?
2016-05-12T20:53:59 <sepidehshahi> I was thinking about Super Mario Builder when I made that sketch
2016-05-12T20:54:04 <danayo> nice!
2016-05-12T20:54:18 * jessm has quit
2016-05-12T20:54:29 <sepidehshahi> the headers for each panel are selectable, and open up the detail view
2016-05-12T20:54:40 <danayo> oh, nice
2016-05-12T20:55:17 <sepidehshahi> I can play more with #1, #3 and #5 to see what other potentials they have and what would be the best flow from the main view to the more detailed views danayo
2016-05-12T20:55:40 <danayo> i wonder...do you think you could combine 1 and 3? such that the collapsed views in #1 look a little more like blocks?
2016-05-12T20:55:50 <danayo> a little ... blockier?
2016-05-12T20:55:52 <danayo> :)
2016-05-12T20:56:10 <sepidehshahi> I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a really good idea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not
2016-05-12T20:56:22 <danayo> cool
2016-05-12T20:56:22 <sepidehshahi> ;)
2016-05-12T20:57:36 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi, these are great
2016-05-12T20:58:37 <sepidehshahi> oh, thank you danayo for your feedback. I\xe2\x80\x99ll work more on them tomorrow. and I have booked us for the design crit on Monday, so we can share our sketches with the rest of team
2016-05-12T20:59:14 <danayo> perfect!
