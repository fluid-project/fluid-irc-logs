2016-06-14T14:28:39 <alanharnum> Jess_: I don't - Vera has the creds for that one
2016-06-14T14:28:52 <Jess_> ah, great, thanks alanharnum
2016-06-14T14:35:10 <jhung> danayo: let me know when you want to chat about the design guidelines static site.

2016-06-14T14:49:10 <Jess_> hey gtirloni i was just looking on the wiki for owncloud instructions
2016-06-14T14:49:35 <Jess_> gtirloni: am i just looking in the wrong place?
2016-06-14T14:50:24 <gtirloni> Jess_, i'm afraid there are no public instructions for it yet. i've only set it to a few people by email.. i'll add something there
2016-06-14T14:50:28 <gtirloni> do you want to install it?
2016-06-14T14:50:48 <Jess_> gtirloni: i do, yes please :)
2016-06-14T14:52:04 <gtirloni> ok, one sec

2016-06-14T15:06:41 <gtirloni> Jess_, you have to install the ownCloud client first (https://owncloud.org/install/#install-clients)
2016-06-14T15:06:50 <gtirloni> Jess_, i'll send you user/password over email
2016-06-14T15:07:06 <gtirloni> the address is https://files.inclusivedesign.ca
2016-06-14T15:07:27 <Jess_> great, i have the client and am pluggin in the address \xe2\x80\x94 thanks!
2016-06-14T15:10:47 <gtirloni> yw :)
2016-06-14T15:15:23 <Jess_> gtirloni: i have a smorgasbord of icons on my task bar now including (google drive, dropbox, and owncloud) :D
2016-06-14T15:15:45 <gtirloni> you should add OneDrive to the collection :)
2016-06-14T15:15:59 <gtirloni> i think we need one cloud storage to rule 'em all
2016-06-14T15:16:16 <Jess_> gtirloni: what could possibly go wrong?!
2016-06-14T15:16:17 <Jess_> lol
2016-06-14T15:19:39 <gtirloni> haha true
2016-06-14T15:19:40 <gtirloni> every time someone asks that question, lots of headaches are prevented :)

2016-06-14T19:40:29 <jhung> danayo: much better! I like it. I wonder if we should put the list of 4 items into a white box as well?
2016-06-14T19:42:11 <danayo> sure jhung, I'll try that
2016-06-14T19:57:25 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-06-14T20:06:10 <danayo> I updated the file jhung https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/sTdOOsXfcbhPu94
2016-06-14T20:07:46 <jhung> danayo: I like it! Helps break up the text a bit better. How do you feel about it?
2016-06-14T20:07:56 <danayo> I like it jhung
2016-06-14T20:08:56 <jhung> Awesome. I'll add that to the site soonish danayo.
2016-06-14T20:09:17 <danayo> thanks jhung. It definitely looks cleaner and more approachable

2016-06-14T20:16:19 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, can I ask you a quick question regarding the toolkit?
2016-06-14T20:16:38 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi
2016-06-14T20:18:04 <sepidehshahi> do you think that if  we need the All/Incomplete/Completed filters on all timeline, calendar and my goals? or is it enough to have it just on the timeline?
2016-06-14T20:19:40 <Jess_> danayo: sepidehshahi: saw this today. not sure i agree with it fundamentally but found it interesting and maybe you will too: https://medium.com/life-learning/why-calendars-are-more-effective-than-to-do-lists-557b07ac9aeb#.vii03us2o
2016-06-14T20:19:44 <sepidehshahi> because on the calendar we also have the Day/Week/month/year filter, and it makes it a little bit confusing on the calendar view to have all these filters
2016-06-14T20:20:23 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: on my browser it just shows up as symbols
2016-06-14T20:20:47 <danayo> hmmm sepidehshahi, I was going to say that it would be good to have it on all three
2016-06-14T20:21:00 <danayo> but I can see that the calendar might get a bit confusing
2016-06-14T20:21:50 <sepidehshahi> Currently I have it on all three, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad. I may be able to find a way to make visually more clrearer
2016-06-14T20:21:52 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: that\xe2\x80\x99s weird
2016-06-14T20:22:15 <sepidehshahi> jess, I copied the link in the browser and it works. thx for sharing
2016-06-14T20:22:20 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, sounds good
2016-06-14T20:22:40 <danayo> thanks Jess_
2016-06-14T20:22:58 <danayo> I actually find a physical calendar very helpful
2016-06-14T20:23:05 <danayo> oldskool
2016-06-14T20:26:29 <Jess_> danayo: i think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably over-simplifying just about everything but thought it was interesting
2016-06-14T20:26:52 <Jess_> there definitely is a Moleskin, write-it-down backlash to the digital
