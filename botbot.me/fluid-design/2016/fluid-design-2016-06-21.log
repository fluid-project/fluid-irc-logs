2016-06-21T15:18:56 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo. I have added more details and polished the design of the toolkit. https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/FH8UVJeZGwTWKTd
2016-06-21T15:20:50 <sepidehshahi> the back/next navigation buttons are added for the notes. Today button is added. Neeta suggested adding a favorite option to the notes, so I have added a bookmark icon. I think that would help the navigation to a specific note.
2016-06-21T15:22:10 <sepidehshahi> also for completed to-do items/goals I have used a dashed visual treatment instead of the bright green background. danayo please let me know what you think in general. And if it looks fine, I can start building the other pages
2016-06-21T15:23:26 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi - will take a look now
2016-06-21T15:23:56 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo

2016-06-21T15:59:15 <simonjb> will do, thanks sepidehshahi -- I\'m thinking we can do it after we meet tomorrow
2016-06-21T15:59:32 <sepidehshahi> for sure. thanks
2016-06-21T15:59:43 <jessm> michelled: anytime up to 5

2016-06-21T16:02:47 <michelled> is anyone else joining us?
2016-06-21T16:03:42 <jessm> 10 minutes from now works fine
2016-06-21T16:05:32 <jessm> i\xe2\x80\x99m fine with us just talking to start. if you want anyone else there, of course invite away
2016-06-21T16:09:40 <jessm> alanharn_: perhaps you want to join me and michelled
2016-06-21T16:10:03 <alanharn_> jessm: sure

2016-06-21T17:26:14 <danayo> sepidehshahi: sorry for the delay, I think the design looks great
2016-06-21T17:26:44 <danayo> we agreed that the today button would move everthing (notes, timeline etc) to today, is that correct?
2016-06-21T17:26:55 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo
2016-06-21T17:27:02 <danayo> cool
2016-06-21T17:28:05 <danayo> at first I was thinking that the today button would be inactive if the notes are already at today sepidehshahi
2016-06-21T17:28:19 <danayo> but i think it could get complicated if the timeline has been scrolled away from today
2016-06-21T17:28:27 <danayo> but the notes remain at today
2016-06-21T17:28:43 <danayo> (until the user selects a specific date on the timeline)
2016-06-21T17:29:28 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo. So, it might be better to always have that button enabled
2016-06-21T17:30:24 <danayo> yes i think so sepidehshahi
2016-06-21T17:30:38 <sepidehshahi> what do you think of back/next navigation and also bookmarking notes
2016-06-21T17:30:40 <sepidehshahi> ?
2016-06-21T17:31:56 <danayo> i think the bookmarking is great sepidehshahi
2016-06-21T17:32:02 <danayo> for the navigation ...
2016-06-21T17:32:09 <danayo> what do you think about having day/week/month?
2016-06-21T17:32:15 <danayo> so single arrow = day
2016-06-21T17:32:20 <danayo> double arrow = week
2016-06-21T17:32:28 <danayo> triple arrow (or something like that) = month
2016-06-21T17:32:39 <danayo> rather than first/last
2016-06-21T17:33:03 <danayo> sepidehshahi?
2016-06-21T17:33:10 <sepidehshahi> so, what would that show? e.g if I select the month, which note in that month is shown?
2016-06-21T17:33:21 <danayo> i\'m thinking the first of the month
2016-06-21T17:33:35 <danayo> or
2016-06-21T17:33:46 <danayo> I suppose it could just jump back one month from the current date
2016-06-21T17:33:53 <danayo> i think that would make more sense
2016-06-21T17:34:34 <sepidehshahi> I think the second optoion is clearer
2016-06-21T17:34:51 <danayo> yes
2016-06-21T17:35:10 <danayo> I\'m thinking it would be more likely someone would want to navigate that way, rather than first/last
2016-06-21T17:35:26 <danayo> what do you think sepidehshahi ?
2016-06-21T17:36:24 * jhung has quit
2016-06-21T17:37:14 <sepidehshahi> you are right. I agree. the only confusing part is that when I go back a month I may want to see a list of notes in that month, rather than a note I made last month at this day danayo
2016-06-21T17:37:56 <sepidehshahi> but overall it is a better navigation than fist/last for sure
2016-06-21T17:38:13 <danayo> perhaps sepidehshahi - i\'m thinking that the relationship to pagination might might make it clear what to expect
2016-06-21T17:38:16 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-06-21T17:39:00 <danayo> so hopefully it\'s clear that the controls are a way to move through the pages
2016-06-21T17:39:08 <danayo> rather than opening a list sepidehshahi
2016-06-21T17:40:12 * michelled has quit
2016-06-21T17:41:27 <sepidehshahi> cool, I\xe2\x80\x99ll use day/week/month and if we find it confusing later on we can see what other navigation options are available
2016-06-21T17:42:33 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi

2016-06-21T18:29:04 <sepidehshahi> danayo I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at Google Calendar and iCalendar and in both of them the Today button has some sort of connection with the day/week/month navigation. so, now I am thoughtful about having a global today button.
2016-06-21T18:30:44 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-06-21T18:31:02 <sepidehshahi> or maybe I could just have another today right in the middle of the day/week/month navigation

2016-06-21T18:36:08 * michelled has quit
2016-06-21T18:36:37 <danayo> interesting sepidehshahi let me take a look
2016-06-21T18:37:09 <sepidehshahi> thx danayo
2016-06-21T18:39:25 <danayo> i think that\'s a good idea sepidehshahi - to combine the today button with the navigation
2016-06-21T18:39:44 <danayo> i\'m still thinking through the link between the notes and the timeline/calendar - in terms of navigation
2016-06-21T18:40:17 <danayo> when selecting a note on the timeline, it makes sense to me that the notes would move to that date
2016-06-21T18:40:24 <danayo> but I\'m not sure about the other way around
2016-06-21T18:42:10 <danayo> I guess it\'s probably best if they\'re always linked
2016-06-21T18:42:24 <danayo> in either direction sepidehshahi
2016-06-21T18:43:25 <danayo> but there is probably a use-case for having set your timeline to a specific point, and then wanting to navigate through your notes separately
2016-06-21T18:45:28 <danayo> in (many) other words - we have agreed that user can navigate through the timeline without affecting the notes (until they make a selection on the timeline) - what about this opposite case, where user is navigating through their notes but wants the timeline to stay put? I think that\'s a realistic use-case

2016-06-21T19:27:46 <sepidehshahi> danayo: that\xe2\x80\x99s a great point you brought up. when navigating through your notes, you arenot  just hovering but actually going to a specific date on a specific date. So in that case maybe the timeline should be updated and aligned with the note in focus.
2016-06-21T19:35:55 <danayo> yeah, i\'m not sure sepidehshahi - i was actually thinking that you might not want the timeline to align with the date of the note. I suppose we could have a "find this note on the timeline" button or something - but that may be getting too complicated
2016-06-21T19:38:59 <sepidehshahi> I agree danayo. So, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep the global \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d button which aligns notes and timeline and then allow for independent scrolling/navigation on each panel. The only time that there is an interaction between the two panel is that when user selects a specific note on the timeline. In this case I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little today button for my notes panel navigation bar
2016-06-21T19:40:25 <danayo> do you mean have both a global today button and a notes-only today button sepidehshahi ?
2016-06-21T19:41:03 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo, just to make that navigation easier.
2016-06-21T19:42:24 * jhung joined the channel
2016-06-21T19:44:45 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi - I think a today button on the notes navigation is great. I\'m uncertain about the global today button - mostly concerned with making its function clear to the user - that it\'s connected to both the notes and the timeline (but not the goals panel), and that it will align the timeline to the date of the note - I think it could be a little confusing.
2016-06-21T19:46:25 <sepidehshahi> ok, what if we use the notes-only today button to align the notes and timeline panels and remove the today button?
2016-06-21T19:46:49 <sepidehshahi> I mean remove the global today biutton
2016-06-21T19:47:23 <danayo> so in that case the today button would align them, but navigation arrows would not?
2016-06-21T19:48:38 <danayo> i think that might be too inconsistent
2016-06-21T19:48:53 <danayo> i\'m thinking - let\'s get rid of the global today button as you suggest
2016-06-21T19:49:06 <danayo> and not link notes navigation to the timeline for now
2016-06-21T19:49:17 <danayo> we can think about other ways to link them
2016-06-21T19:49:33 <danayo> in future
2016-06-21T19:49:55 <danayo> what do you think?
2016-06-21T19:52:28 <sepidehshahi> sure. are we still supporting the selection of an item on the timeline and updating the note panel based on that selection?
2016-06-21T19:52:37 <danayo> yes
2016-06-21T19:53:04 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks danayo and sorry to interrupt you with all these questions
2016-06-21T19:53:28 <danayo> no sorries! it\'s important :)
2016-06-21T19:56:16 <danayo> these are good questions and good discussion sepidehshahi thanks for the great work
2016-06-21T19:56:57 <sepidehshahi> :) and thanks for all the detailed feedback danayo
