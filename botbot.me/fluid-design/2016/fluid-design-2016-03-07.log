2016-03-07T15:50:19 <sepidehshahi> good morning danayo, jessm and I had a chat on Friday about the design guides and how their conent should be made more approachable to people who are not designers, not from open communities and come from commercial companies and people whose first language is not English. So, I went through the all principles and tried to mark any areas that could be simplified, or rephrased.
2016-03-07T15:51:33 <sepidehshahi> we laso asked Neeta to provide a fresh eye on the content and give us her perspective as someone who is not really familiar with IDRC and what we do here. So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue going through practices and toools today.

2016-03-07T16:33:47 <PaliwalSparsh> @danayo Justin_o asked me to contact you about how the design of a prev/next link should be when they are disabled ie when first/last link is selected in the pager demo. I am presently making the background color grey, please can you suggest any change if it needs one.
2016-03-07T16:33:48 <PaliwalSparsh> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-3921
2016-03-07T16:45:14 <danayo> when you say background colour PaliwalSparsh, do you mean text colour? You're referring to the Previous and Next text, right?
2016-03-07T16:45:27 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-03-07T16:45:39 <danayo> or have you created a button PaliwalSparsh ?

2016-03-07T17:08:46 <PaliwalSparsh42> @danayo my internet was giving some problem then sorry for late reply. I was talking about Previous and Next only, when they are disabled i have placed them in a box with grey fill to show they are not active and have kept the color of text of link same.
2016-03-07T17:10:08 <danayo> could you please attach a screenshot to the JIRA PaliwalSparsh42 ?
2016-03-07T17:10:33 <PaliwalSparsh42> certainly i will add it right now only
2016-03-07T17:17:56 <PaliwalSparsh42> @danayo I have added the screenshot as CAPTURE3.PNG on FLUID-3921
2016-03-07T17:18:51 <danayo> thanks PaliwalSparsh42. I find that the appearance of a box (when there wasn't one before) ends up highlighting the text. I think it would be better to just grey the text itself for now (we might want to consider adding a persistent button at some point)
2016-03-07T17:19:04 <danayo> button/box
2016-03-07T17:22:14 <PaliwalSparsh42> thanks i will remove the fill and just change the color of text to gray
2016-03-07T17:23:25 <PaliwalSparsh42> @danayo needed one more little help please for the FLUID-5057
2016-03-07T17:26:12 <PaliwalSparsh42> In order to remove the existing background image in UIoption component, we will need to add some background made with css in place, so what kind of background should we take ,i have proposed 2 in the comment would love if you could help me figure out this.
