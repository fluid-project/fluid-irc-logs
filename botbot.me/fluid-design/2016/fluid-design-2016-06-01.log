2016-06-01T13:26:15 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I received access to the preview release for figma.com It\'s another option for collaborating on design. Let me know if you\'d like to try it out.

2016-06-01T13:26:51 <lliskovoi> justin_o cool! would love to check it out
2016-06-01T13:27:21 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: i\'ll send you my login and password
2016-06-01T13:27:38 <lliskovoi> thanks Justin_o~
2016-06-01T13:27:42 <lliskovoi> !*
2016-06-01T13:28:46 <Justin_o> np, let me know what you think.. I haven\'t tried anything with it myself yet.
2016-06-01T13:30:12 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: this is really interesting.
2016-06-01T13:31:28 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: would you like to try it too?
2016-06-01T13:32:39 <sepidehshahi> Absolutely. I signed up for it. It seems that the full version is not released yet
2016-06-01T13:32:54 <Justin_o> Yah, just in preview for now
2016-06-01T13:36:49 <sepidehshahi> The design part of the tool is similar to Sketch 3. what makes this different (if it works) is that it allows for live collaboration. The only problem may be versioning. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to try it soon. thanks for sharing
2016-06-01T13:43:24 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: it\'s supposed to support versions.. they say "Constantly saved, and old versions are accessible with one click."

2016-06-01T15:55:10 <sepidehshahi> np. In this version we only track the chnages made to GPII preferences.

And the journal page is actually a day view of a calendar. please let me knoe if you had any questions

2016-06-01T19:56:51 <colinclark> Here\'s a link to the The Abstract is \'an Enemy\' paper by Alan Blackwell and co. It, in part, does an analysis of the usability issues with Sakai, based on the argument that abstract representations in software are a major cause of usability problems.
2016-06-01T19:57:18 <colinclark> "user centred design tend to be  grounded in the needs and actions of specific users. The design of software architectures and organisational processes, in contrast, aims to identify, implement and maintain effective data and process abstractions."
