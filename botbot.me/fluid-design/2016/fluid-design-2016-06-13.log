2016-06-13T21:06:24 <jhung> I've pushed my latest version of the design guidelines static site to gh-pages. You can find it here danayo: https://jhung.github.io/docs-guidelines/index.html
2016-06-13T21:06:43 <jhung> There are some quirks (hover styles especially), but you should get a feel for where it's going.
2016-06-13T21:06:52 <jhung> Let's chat about it tomorrow danayo?
