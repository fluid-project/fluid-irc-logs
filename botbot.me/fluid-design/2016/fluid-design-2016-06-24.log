2016-06-24T15:15:39 <Jess_> anyone using their mobile to control their TV?
2016-06-24T15:21:27 * jhung joined the channel
2016-06-24T15:25:15 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: not currently, but I used to
2016-06-24T15:25:33 <Jess_> cool!
2016-06-24T15:25:59 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i used to as well. why did you stop?
2016-06-24T15:26:00 <jhung> Jess_: I don\'t use it to control a media streamer connected to my TV via Chromecast. Not sure if that\'s "TV". :)
2016-06-24T15:26:15 <jhung> *rather I use it to control a media streamer...

2016-06-24T15:26:24 <Jess_> it is interesting isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? what is TV?
2016-06-24T15:26:28 <Jess_> TV is hardware :P
2016-06-24T15:26:45 <jhung> Jess_: Ask my kids and they\'ll give you a different answer.
2016-06-24T15:27:01 <Jess_> jhung: what would they say?!
2016-06-24T15:27:46 <sepidehshahi> not these days Jess_ TVs are mostly a media hub for storing, navigating, and sharing streamed or personal content
2016-06-24T15:27:50 <jhung> Jess_: to them "TV" is streamed video from any source. Youtube, broadcast TV (i.e. TVO Kids), etc. They don\'t differentiate the different sources. They consume on a screen, parents / teachers control the content / sources. So they\'ve no real concept of that.
2016-06-24T15:29:16 <Jess_> you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much redundancy now too! TVs with internet uplink, then chromecast doing the same work, then hooking up an external device (computer, iPad, etc.)
2016-06-24T15:29:30 <Jess_> i like the media hub idea sepidehshahi
2016-06-24T15:29:45 <jhung> for me, TV used to refer to content broadcast over cable or antenna, but now "TV" is just the hardware.
2016-06-24T15:31:27 * Jess_ remembers pre-remote days ;)
2016-06-24T15:31:55 <Jess_> jhung: for me too \xe2\x80\x94 TV is a monitor
2016-06-24T15:32:12 <jhung> yes Jess_. The redundancy is huge. My kids can pick up where they left off on the "TV", iPad, etc.
2016-06-24T15:32:22 <jhung> It\'s for this reason I don\'t put Netflix on my phone. :D
2016-06-24T15:36:03 <sepidehshahi> It is also truning in to a part of the connected system of devices that you have all around the house or sometimes outside of the house (your office, your car). It can communicate with your alarm system, your appliences, your nest and all other devices.
