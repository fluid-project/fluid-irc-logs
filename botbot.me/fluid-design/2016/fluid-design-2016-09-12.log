2016-09-12T18:38:31 <danayo> hi jhung, have you had a chance to look at my pull request for the guide?
2016-09-12T18:40:47 <jhung> danayo: sorry I didn\'t know there was one. I must have missed it. I probably won\'t have time to look at it until tomorrow, that okay?
2016-09-12T18:44:29 <danayo> ah, sorry jhung. thought i mentioned it at standup last week. i\'m anxious to get the principles/insights changes up (especially in light of Jutta\'s email about folks trying to find our "toolkit" etc). but one more day shouldn\'t be a big deal
2016-09-12T18:46:05 <jhung> danayo: ok. In that case I\'ll take a look at it now.
2016-09-12T18:46:43 <danayo> thanks jhung
2016-09-12T19:41:08 <danayo> jhung, do you recall if we made formal notes at the last discussion we had about the ILDH / Guide / Handbook when we met with Tim and Godfrey? I\'m trying to recall what we discussed/decided, particularly about the Fluid Handbook content. (I probably took written notes, just need to do some digging)
2016-09-12T19:42:37 <jhung> Yeah. there were notes danayo. Let me dig them up danayo
2016-09-12T19:42:42 <danayo> thank you!!
2016-09-12T19:44:39 * clown joined the channel
2016-09-12T19:49:22 <jhung> danayo: here they are. We should probably copy this to the Wiki. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZYjWJlB7gMhpqiwuMpd4g_JuEdjAteRSdcK8EBw5A50/edit
2016-09-12T19:50:13 <danayo> very helpful, thanks jhung! I\'ll post them to wiki
2016-09-12T19:50:23 <jhung> ok. Let me know when it
2016-09-12T19:50:41 <jhung> \'s there, so I can "close" off the doc and leave a link for people to go to the wiki instead.
2016-09-12T19:50:47 <jhung> ^danayo
2016-09-12T19:50:56 <danayo> will do jhung
2016-09-12T20:18:00 <jhung> danayo: I left some comments on the pull request.
2016-09-12T20:18:08 <danayo> great jhung, thanks!
2016-09-12T20:18:32 <jhung> np
2016-09-12T20:25:38 <danayo> jhung, I\'ve put the Guide/ILDH notes here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/August+15%2C+2016%2C+Design+Guides+and+ILDH+Restructuring
2016-09-12T20:25:44 <danayo> and have linked to them from 2 places
2016-09-12T20:26:05 <danayo> from the Guide wiki page here (and created as a child page from) https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/The+Inclusive+Design+Guide
2016-09-12T20:26:18 <danayo> and from here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Inclusive+Learning+Design+Handbook
2016-09-12T20:26:30 <danayo> does that sound good to you jhung?
2016-09-12T20:28:38 <jhung> danayo: works for me. Thanks! I\'ve closed that google doc now.
2016-09-12T20:28:43 <jhung> and left a link.
2016-09-12T20:28:48 <danayo> great
