2016-07-25T14:40:47 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo, what time works best for you on Thursday afternoon to confirm the meeting with Caren? she is available between 12:30 to 4:00
2016-07-25T14:41:55 <sepidehshahi> Justin moved the Design Community meeting to August 10th on the calendar. Do you think if we should send out an email to the communitity regarding this data change, danayo?
2016-07-25T14:49:33 <danayo> yes sepidehshahi, just about to send that email actually
2016-07-25T14:50:16 <danayo> and why don\'t we say 1:30 on Thursday?
2016-07-25T14:50:31 <sepidehshahi> that works for me
2016-07-25T14:50:46 <danayo> great, thanks

2016-07-25T16:23:38 <danayo> sepidehshahi, michelled, alanharnum Jess suggested 3pm to meet about data tracking, does that work for everyone?
2016-07-25T16:23:52 <alanharnum> danayo: works for me!
2016-07-25T16:26:34 <michelled> danayo: I have a PGA meeting at that time, although it probably won\'t take all that long so I can join late. Perhaps someone can give me the low down on what TJ said and what you all decide in the meeting.
2016-07-25T16:26:56 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-07-25T16:27:02 <danayo> sure michelled
2016-07-25T16:27:06 <michelled> thx!
2016-07-25T16:27:42 <colinclark> ooh, interesting danayo
2016-07-25T16:27:45 <colinclark> can I join you guys too?
2016-07-25T16:28:41 <danayo> sure colinclark!
2016-07-25T16:29:10 <colinclark> awesome!
2016-07-25T16:51:28 <colinclark> jhung: sepidehshahi mentioned to me that you\'re the one to talk to in order to get access to the shared design folder in our Own Cloud, is that right?
2016-07-25T16:52:53 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just saw your message. 3:00 pm works for me as well.
2016-07-25T16:53:52 <danayo> great sepidehshahi
2016-07-25T16:57:49 <jhung> colinclark: I think I\'ve set it up so anyone who has "can share" access can grant permissions to another user.
2016-07-25T16:57:58 <colinclark> oh cool
2016-07-25T16:57:59 <jhung> I\'ll add you now anyway colinclark.
2016-07-25T16:58:02 <colinclark> great, jhung
2016-07-25T16:58:16 <colinclark> And is there a way to make the folder "world readable?"
2016-07-25T16:58:43 <colinclark> It would be great if it were easy to link to our living designs
2016-07-25T16:58:59 <jhung> Not sure colinclark. There\'s a "Share Link" option which I\'m looking at now.
2016-07-25T16:59:02 <colinclark> for twitter or wiki-linking or sharing with mailing lists or whatever other purposes
2016-07-25T16:59:24 <colinclark> It would be awesomely open and collaborative if we could figure out a way to do that
2016-07-25T16:59:53 <jhung> colinclark: the share link seems to do what we want. Try this: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Ffxb1OCkEJ8l3or
2016-07-25T17:00:11 <colinclark> jhung: awesome!
2016-07-25T17:00:41 <jhung> Then you can share the url to a file directly. Example: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Ffxb1OCkEJ8l3or?path=%2FInclusive%20Resources%20and%20Tools%2FFlowers%20%26%20Petals#pdfviewer
2016-07-25T17:40:00 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi, i\'m in the process of adding the "petals and flowers" activity to the design guide and I have a few questions about how best to link to or present this in the guide itself, which are the latest files etc - do yo have a few minutes to chat?

2016-07-25T19:02:13 <colinclark> you mean fluid_standup the vidyo room?
2016-07-25T19:02:44 <sepidehshahi> or the fluid-work IRC chat?
2016-07-25T19:03:12 <Jess_> sorry, the vidyo room

2016-07-25T20:13:50 <sepidehshahi> danayo: lliskovoi is going to join our dashboard meeting. However, she is not in on Thursdays. Is there any other day that works better for you? if we can meet some time before 1:00pm EST, Neeta can also join.
2016-07-25T20:18:43 <lliskovoi> danayo sepidehshahi, I\'m also not in on Fridays.
2016-07-25T20:24:30 <Jess_> alanharnum: nice email!
2016-07-25T20:27:53 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: your draft email looks great! Thanks for putting it together. I think sharing your personal example of tracking would encourage many more people to participate in the conversation.
2016-07-25T20:42:20 <alanharnum> Jess_ sepideshahi - thanks. colinclark, danayo, have you had a chance to take a look?
2016-07-25T20:44:10 <colinclark> I like it too, alanharnum
2016-07-25T20:44:19 <danayo> sorry alanharnum, just on a call, will look asap
2016-07-25T20:44:28 <colinclark> as sepidehshahi said, including yourself in the discussion helps make it real
2016-07-25T20:45:22 <alanharnum> danayo: no rush needed - just want to make sure everyone has a chance to have a look before i send
2016-07-25T20:45:35 <alanharnum> colinclark: it only seemed right if i\'m asking others to share :)
2016-07-25T20:45:42 <colinclark> yup, exactly
