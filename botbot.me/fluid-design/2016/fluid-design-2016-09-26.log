2016-09-26T15:15:52 <jessm> jhung: good idea
2016-09-26T15:15:57 <jessm> sure
2016-09-26T15:15:59 <jessm> either works
2016-09-26T15:16:37 <jhung> jessm: let's try now?

2016-09-26T16:49:59 <jessm> this uses CAR \xe2\x80\x94 to get to word
2016-09-26T16:51:27 <jessm> from what I can tell Central Access Reader isn\xe2\x80\x99t huge with the digital math folks, but is with the folks who are interested in practical tools that can work for students now

2016-09-26T19:09:10 <jhung> Sure. Give me 2 minutes to finish making my coffee. Which room jessm?
2016-09-26T19:09:18 <jessm> my room?
2016-09-26T19:11:49 <jhung> sure
2016-09-26T19:44:04 <Justin_o> danayo, lliskovoi , jhung : that one of you could help me with a design exercise for Kobi and David123 on thursday afternoon.
2016-09-26T19:48:44 <lliskovoi> Justin_o, most likely, how long is the activity?
2016-09-26T19:49:51 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: i'm hoping to go over a scenario with the design cards. I want to get them thinking about Inclusive Design, but I don't really know how to use the cards myself.
2016-09-26T19:51:12 <michelled> isn't using the cards context dependent? Meaning everyone will use them differently?
2016-09-26T19:51:55 <lliskovoi> hmmm, I haven't done any activities with the cards other than the one community meeting
2016-09-26T19:57:36 <danayo> Justin_o, lliskovoi, michelled, maybe it would be a good chance to try out the existing activities, including the ones that Tim and Godfrey put together

2016-09-26T20:00:55 <jessm> jhung: do you know when the call is on Wednesday with Pressbooks?
2016-09-26T20:01:10 <danayo> also these walk-throughs are interesting - might want to try doing something like this applied to a high school classroom environment Justin_o, lliskovoi  ? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9JaN3TKapp84dcsZ8xt58ZlOsrHuhH_43dxDOoY9VI/edit?usp=sharing
2016-09-26T20:02:23 <jhung> looking at the doodle poll now\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-09-26T20:02:55 <jhung> 2:30pm ET jessm
2016-09-26T20:03:49 <Justin_o> danayo: interesting ideas, i like the idea of using this as an opportunity to also try out the new material.
2016-09-26T20:11:22 <danayo> yeah, i think it's definitely a good opportunity for that Justin_o
2016-09-26T20:12:01 <jessm> thanks jhung and thanks for popping into that meeting
2016-09-26T20:12:07 <jessm> so amazing what a few minutes of face to face can do
2016-09-26T20:14:29 <jhung> jessm: yeah. It was good! Hopefully it gives him some ideas how he can make small but meaningful improvements to the admin ui.
2016-09-26T20:14:56 <jessm> jhung: that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he said he\xe2\x80\x99s going to look into between now and wednesday and come to that meeting with ideas
2016-09-26T20:15:02 <jessm> he\xe2\x80\x99ll look at the build site
2016-09-26T20:16:00 <jhung> jessm: cool. We didn't talk about Math though\xe2\x80\xa6 we'd have to block off another hour just to crack that one.
2016-09-26T20:16:10 <jessm> jhung: OMG i know!
2016-09-26T20:30:59 <lliskovoi> danayo Justin_o, the two activities look like a great place to start, and I agree that a walkthrough may be a great activity as well if it has a relative scenario (maybe a bit down the road once they've familiarized themselves with the cards and concepts?), are you thinking Activity 1 for Thursday?
2016-09-26T21:01:40 <jhung> danayo: for tomorrow's design crit you wanted to cover UIO redesign, correct?
2016-09-26T21:05:48 <danayo> yes jhung. and maybe a quick discussion of the toolkit landing page idea
2016-09-26T21:06:26 <jhung> ok. Thanks danayo. I'll send out the email.
2016-09-26T21:11:01 <danayo> thanks jhung
