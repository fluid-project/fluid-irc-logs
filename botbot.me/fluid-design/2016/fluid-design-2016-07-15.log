2016-07-15T16:54:46 <Jess_> awesome UIO integration: http://aplusa.org/about/
2016-07-15T16:55:19 <Jess_> if you remember sara hendren \xe2\x80\x94 this is a site showcasing her work and the work of her students at Olin College in the boston area. They are doing some really cool things there
2016-07-15T16:55:26 <Jess_> fluid-everyone: ^
2016-07-15T17:01:48 <jhung> Nice Jess_!
2016-07-15T17:02:55 <sepidehshahi> this is great Jess_ ! and the changes you make are persistent, which is awesome! I only had hardtime finding the icons for opening/closing or reseting the panel when I chose white on black
2016-07-15T17:03:34 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: yeah, they have some tweaking to do i\xe2\x80\x99d guess. it\xe2\x80\x99s a brand new site
2016-07-15T17:03:47 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: you like that the changes are persistent? should there be a reset?
2016-07-15T17:05:33 <sepidehshahi> Jess_: yes it is really helpful, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to adjust the preferences everytime I open that page. There is a reset icon
2016-07-15T17:05:50 <Jess_> oh, i think i lost the reset icon
2016-07-15T17:06:13 <sepidehshahi> it\xe2\x80\x99s on the left of the UIO icon
2016-07-15T17:06:56 <sepidehshahi> both the integration of UIO is great in their site and also the the projects they are working on! thanks for sharing
2016-07-15T17:07:04 <Jess_> yeah, something happened and i lost it
2016-07-15T17:07:14 <Jess_> their projects are so cool, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?!
2016-07-15T17:08:32 <sepidehshahi> Yes!! so simple yet practical

2016-07-15T18:32:43 <Jess_> another exciting site that just went live! fluid-everyone: http://quantization.ca
2016-07-15T18:32:48 <Jess_> it looks soooo slick
2016-07-15T18:32:55 <sepidehshahi> Hi colinclark, I am doing a little bit of research about digital sliders (both vertical and horizontal) for our GSoC project. based on your experience, what do you think are the most important aspects of sliders for musicians? what\xe2\x80\x99s their advantage over knobs or other type of controls?
2016-07-15T18:34:20 <jhung> awesome Jess_! That's also a great photo of Jutta!
2016-07-15T18:35:07 <Jess_> isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?!
2016-07-15T18:36:27 <sepidehshahi> Awesome Jess_ !
2016-07-15T18:36:45 <Jess_> kaveh and arezoo did such a great job putting this together

2016-07-15T19:44:34 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: relevant to the dashboard work! http://lifehacker.com/the-psychological-benefits-of-writing-regularly-1783693547?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=Lifehacker_twitter
2016-07-15T20:03:01 <sepidehshahi> thanks Jess_  this brings up an intersting point. The dashboard\xe2\x80\x99s note section encourages you to reflect on your mood or goals. Now the questions is how much influence do we want to have on your answers to those questions? is it important to know how you really feel in that moment and free your mind (e.g. anxcious), or is it better if the dashboard suggests you to document the positive side of how you
2016-07-15T20:03:02 <sepidehshahi> feel (e.g. excited)? which one helps you better in the long term?
2016-07-15T20:06:01 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: ha! good point. positive psychologists would advocate for the positive outlook obviously \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s something we can decide, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly interesting to think about: let people muse about what might be negative or encourage positive?
2016-07-15T20:06:50 <Jess_> i think unless we start to get into messy AI we\xe2\x80\x99d expect tech to be more descriptive and less prescriptive though we tolerate an awul lot of the latter
2016-07-15T20:07:58 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right
