2016-01-20T21:45:01 <danayo> hey sepidehshahi, wonder if I could get your feedback on this - trying to come up with good design for a button that is inactive/disabled, in high-contrast mode (so don\'t want to grey it out) https://www.dropbox.com/s/bj4a6zvddslqky6/uioptions%20hi%20contrast%20inactive.pdf?dl=0
2016-01-20T21:45:41 <danayo> I like the multiple diagonal lines, but there is some crazy optical illusion that makes the buttons look crooked (at least to my eyes)
2016-01-20T21:46:02 <sepidehshahi> oh, let me see danayo
2016-01-20T21:47:58 * alanharnum has quit
2016-01-20T21:52:59 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2016-01-20T21:53:22 <sepidehshahi> danayo, in terms of conveying a button is disabled those multiple lies work the best but they create the worst optical illusing among those options. I personally prefer the last option which has a streight line strike through the words. however, it is not really clear that the button is disabled. let me play with some ideas and send you something in a few minutes
2016-01-20T21:53:39 <danayo> thanks, i agree
2016-01-20T21:54:09 <danayo> hmmm, might help if those lines are at less of an angle sepidehshahi
2016-01-20T21:54:48 <sepidehshahi> I think so, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying an X shape to see whether that helps with the illusion
2016-01-20T21:56:52 <danayo> cool
2016-01-20T22:00:02 * clown has quit
2016-01-20T22:08:09 <danayo> different angle seems to improve things sepidehshahi https://www.dropbox.com/s/bj4a6zvddslqky6/uioptions%20hi%20contrast%20inactive.pdf?dl=0
2016-01-20T22:08:33 <danayo> but the other thing about this design (multiple diagonals) is that I find it tends to highlight/emphasize the button
2016-01-20T22:08:48 <danayo> rather than de-emphasize it
2016-01-20T22:09:03 <danayo> but I dont\' know if that can be avoided
2016-01-20T22:10:03 <sepidehshahi> yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s so much better. the optical illusion is almost gone
