2016-10-25T14:50:27 <alanharnum> danayo: they're a really interesting project
2016-10-25T14:50:46 <alanharnum> highly successful open source project based on providing a good documentation platform for other open source projects

2016-10-25T15:25:42 <jhung> danayo: I took a look at your branch. The hover style for the footer needs to be defined (currently it's taking the default hover style for standard text anchors). You'd probably want to define a rule like: footer a:hover svg { fill: some colour; }
2016-10-25T15:27:20 <danayo> thanks jhung, i did try defining something at one point (copied the approach for the header logo), but couldn't get it to work for some reason
2016-10-25T15:29:33 <jhung> you'd also have to override the style for the footer. footer a:hover { background: none; }
2016-10-25T15:29:51 <jhung> That would get rid of the white background when you hover danayo
2016-10-25T15:30:20 <danayo> ok jhung. by white background do you mean the bar that appears under the logos?
2016-10-25T15:30:52 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-10-25T15:52:15 <jhung> danayo: yes exactly. The bar is actually the background color of the anchor. The SVG contained in the anchor isn't big enough vertically to cover that space.

2016-10-25T15:58:25 <danayo> ah ok jhung, thanks

2016-10-25T16:39:50 <danayo> jhung: i managed to override it in the default colour theme, but it's still appearing in the contrast themes - can't figure out where that's happening, any ideas?

2016-10-25T16:50:10 * michelled joined the channel
2016-10-25T16:52:19 <jhung> danayo: you would have to add a separate override for the anchor hover for the contrast theme. You should probably take advantage of the contrast-theme() function at line 458 to set the contrast styles
2016-10-25T16:54:42 <danayo> jhung: i tried a few things - e.g. repeating the same markup ( a:hover.footer-logo-links { background: none; } ) within the contrast-theme function, but can't seem to get it to work
2016-10-25T16:55:39 <jhung> ok. Give me a second and we can vidyo chat danayo?
2016-10-25T16:55:44 <danayo> sure jhung

2016-10-25T21:37:20 <jhung> awesome danayo! I'll take a look at it in the morning.
2016-10-25T21:37:35 <danayo> thanks jhung, and thanks for your help
2016-10-25T21:37:41 <jhung> np
2016-10-25T21:43:38 <danayo> colinclark, alanharnum: wondering if you had a chance to discuss APCP MyL3 work - and wanted to let you know that I'm prioritising that work now and have started some sketching on the UI that we discussed previously
2016-10-25T21:48:06 <colinclark> we haven't discussed it, danayo
2016-10-25T21:48:13 <colinclark> i was hoping we could, all three of us, talk through it
2016-10-25T21:48:36 <colinclark> today's been crazy with meetings, but it would be great to talk tomorrow
2016-10-25T21:49:13 <danayo> sure thing colinclark
2016-10-25T21:49:22 <colinclark> when works for you?
2016-10-25T21:50:10 <danayo> any time other than community meeting (which is at 10 tomorrow)
2016-10-25T21:50:30 <danayo> colinclark ^
2016-10-25T21:51:13 <colinclark> looks like i can do any time 1 pm EDT and beyond tomorrow
2016-10-25T21:51:17 <colinclark> how about you, alanharnum?
