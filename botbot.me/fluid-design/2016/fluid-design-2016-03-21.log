2016-03-21T20:28:09 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum, danayo: do you have access to ROMEO? do you see our application? I can\xe2\x80\x99t find our application for the chart authoring tool.
2016-03-21T20:28:48 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: let me check
2016-03-21T20:28:56 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2016-03-21T20:32:11 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: i don't see anything under either Prinicipal Investigator or Project Team Member
2016-03-21T20:32:17 <alanharnum> it's possible that only Jutta has access?
2016-03-21T20:33:02 <danayo> I don't see anything either sepidehshahi, alanharnum
2016-03-21T20:33:36 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo and alanharnum: I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Jutta an email to see if she can find the application so we could make the changes.
