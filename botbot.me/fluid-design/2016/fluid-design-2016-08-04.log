2016-08-04T16:05:01 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i was just saying that ICYMI means in case you missed it

2016-08-04T16:37:37 <alanharnum> article of interest: http://civichall.org/civicist/truer-story-civic-tech/
2016-08-04T16:37:45 <alanharnum> "Elizabeth added that it may take \xe2\x80\x9cmore paperwork\xe2\x80\x9d to fund a thoughtful design phase\xe2\x80\x94since the final goals won\xe2\x80\x99t be clear at the outset, but the extra planning is worth it, especially because technology can easily impinge on human rights in the effort to protect them."

2016-08-04T18:20:31 <colinclark> I was seated in a row with a passenger who was blind recently on Air Canada
2016-08-04T18:20:43 <colinclark> and the attendant was amazing, introducing herself, offering to help
2016-08-04T18:20:57 <colinclark> but there was a very awkward moment when she had to explain how to press the attendent call button
2016-08-04T18:21:04 <colinclark> which on the new systems are entirely digital
2016-08-04T18:21:23 <colinclark> and without a screenreader, there was simply no way to know where to press to ask for help
