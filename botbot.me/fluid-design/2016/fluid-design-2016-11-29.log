2016-11-29T19:28:02 <lliskovoi> dana, could you confirm the numbers for me for the cards: 43 double sided half page cards, 1 double sided full page, 18 single sided petals?
2016-11-29T19:28:06 <lliskovoi> do I have that right?
2016-11-29T19:31:27 <lliskovoi> danayo: ^
2016-11-29T19:33:05 <danayo> lliskovoi: just in a meeting will check asap
2016-11-29T19:33:15 <lliskovoi> thanks
2016-11-29T19:36:56 * clown joined the channel
2016-11-29T20:01:42 <danayo> lliskovoi:  I count 44 double-sided 1/2 page cards (this includes 2 that are blank on one half - inluding Metadata (Tool) and the Intro card for which I've deleted the double), 1 double-sided full, and 6 single-sided petals.

2016-11-29T20:04:12 <danayo> lliskovoi: let me know if you want to chat briefly
2016-11-29T20:07:18 <lliskovoi> ah, ok, I didn't count the blank Tools card.
2016-11-29T20:07:31 <lliskovoi> Could we have a look at the petals together?
2016-11-29T20:07:46 <lliskovoi> danayo: ^
2016-11-29T20:08:07 <danayo> ah you are counting the petals individually, yes? lliskovoi
2016-11-29T20:08:20 <lliskovoi> yes, since they'll be cut individualls
2016-11-29T20:08:26 <lliskovoi> individually*
2016-11-29T20:08:26 <danayo> right
2016-11-29T20:08:42 <danayo> then that sounds accurate lliskovoi
2016-11-29T20:08:43 <danayo> 18
2016-11-29T20:08:48 <lliskovoi> ok, great, thank you!
2016-11-29T20:08:50 <danayo> 3 on each of 6 pages
2016-11-29T20:08:53 <danayo> thank you!!
2016-11-29T20:10:54 <danayo> just to clarify lliskovoi,  the 44 1/2 pages will end up being 86 double-sided cards, right? (44 X 2 less the 2 blank halves)
2016-11-29T20:11:17 <danayo> oops, sorry
2016-11-29T20:11:21 <danayo> i mean 43!
2016-11-29T20:11:23 <danayo> as you said haha
2016-11-29T20:11:33 <lliskovoi> haha, ok, was just about to clarify
2016-11-29T20:11:37 <danayo> :)
2016-11-29T20:14:23 <lliskovoi> danayo michelled just got a couple of questions from the printing house:
2016-11-29T20:14:34 <lliskovoi> Just a few questions for you.  The cross hairs in the files are meant to be part of the design and not crop marks correct?
2016-11-29T20:14:35 <lliskovoi> Do you need the \xe2\x80\x9cpetals\xe2\x80\x9d lamninated? I would guess that they are meant to be drawn on an arranged as shown in the 8.5 x 11 page. We have a dry erase laminate if they are meant to be rewritable.
2016-11-29T20:14:46 <danayo> they are crop marks lliskovoi
2016-11-29T20:15:08 <lliskovoi> ok, I'll let her know
2016-11-29T20:15:17 <danayo> and dry erase laminate would be super cool, if we can cover the extra cost
2016-11-29T20:15:43 <danayo> lliskovoi: I just realised something
2016-11-29T20:15:52 <danayo> we should only have crop marks on one side of the page
2016-11-29T20:16:04 <danayo> I will remove the extras now
2016-11-29T20:16:24 <lliskovoi> danayo I didn't check all the pages, but I think that's the case for most
2016-11-29T20:16:32 <lliskovoi> they're only on one side
2016-11-29T20:17:01 <lliskovoi> at least for tools and practices
2016-11-29T20:17:14 <danayo> yeah, I think tools and practices are mostly ok
2016-11-29T20:17:18 <danayo> I'll check and fix the rest
2016-11-29T20:18:15 <lliskovoi> thanks!
2016-11-29T20:21:05 <danayo> shouuld all be good now lliskovoi
2016-11-29T20:21:31 <lliskovoi> thanks danayo, I can send her the updated file once we get the quote approved
2016-11-29T20:22:14 <danayo> great lliskovoi
2016-11-29T20:24:18 <lliskovoi> I was wondering if we should set up the crop marks differently, since cutters aren't usually 100% precise, the way they're set up now, trances of the lines could end up on the printed card.  If we place them farther outside of the body of the card, it leaves some room for error.
2016-11-29T20:24:29 <lliskovoi> Like this: https://www.google.ca/search?q=crop+marks&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiwv63Y5c7QAhWL54MKHYKcDLIQ_AUICCgB&biw=2110&bih=846#imgrc=-pVJsSaWsNEkYM%3A
2016-11-29T20:24:35 <lliskovoi> what do you think?
2016-11-29T20:24:59 <lliskovoi> danayo: ^ (sorry, keep forgetting to include your handle today)
2016-11-29T20:27:11 <danayo> lliskovoi: that would be great - definitely a better way to do it!
2016-11-29T20:28:37 <lliskovoi> danayo: awesome, do you have time or would you like me to do it?
2016-11-29T20:29:19 <danayo> lliskovoi: if you can do it that would be FABULOUS :)
2016-11-29T20:30:34 <lliskovoi> danayo: for sure, no problem!
2016-11-29T20:31:01 <danayo> thanks lliskovoi
2016-11-29T20:31:18 <lliskovoi> :)
2016-11-29T20:34:13 <lliskovoi> danayo: would you mind sending me the ttf files for Gotham-Bold and Gotham-Book?
2016-11-29T20:35:19 <danayo> sure one sec lliskovoi
