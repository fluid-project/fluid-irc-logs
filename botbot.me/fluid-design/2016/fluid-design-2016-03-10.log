b'2016-03-10T17:15:48 <colinclark> guidelines are closer to "rules" in this regard
2016-03-10T17:15:57 <Justin_o> danayo: :) i could screen share if you want, but i should be able to just give you access as well.
2016-03-10T17:16:06 <danayo> sure Justin_o :)
2016-03-10T17:16:13 <danayo> access would be good
2016-03-10T17:16:40 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: I was just reading this really nice paragraph in Jutta\'s newest papers...
2016-03-10T17:16:44 <colinclark> People with disabilities are more diverse than any other group. The only commonality and centrally defining characteristic of disability is difference. People experiencing disabilities also have far fewer degrees of freedom to adapt to designs that do not fit. Paradoxically we have created systems of accessibility whose implicit assumption is uniformity and homogeneity by attempting to achieve accessibility through
2016-03-10T17:16:45 <colinclark> one-size-fits-all accessibility requirements. We further constrain our accessibility approaches by striving to create accessibility regulations, guidelines and laws that are simple -- static (or \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d) accessibility checklists with absolute and testable criteria. This is understandable. Accessibility is a precarious value. When any excuse can and will be used not to comply; simple, static, absolute rules are seen to b
2016-03-10T17:16:46 <colinclark> more effective. As an accessibility community, when we are threatened we act like any other group under threat: we resort to rigidity, armor ourselves, appeal to higher authority, use the force of law, resist change and argue in absolutes. This may allay the immediate threat. But this approach sacrifices the far greater long-term possibilities, and compromises the flexibility needed to address difference.
2016-03-10T17:16:52 <danayo> true colinclark (rules)
2016-03-10T17:17:18 <colinclark> Somehow I imagine that what we\'re giving designers is a set of tools, strategies, techniques, ideas, perspectives, starting points...
2016-03-10T17:17:21 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right colinclark
2016-03-10T17:17:39 <colinclark> from which they can assemble a method or a practice themselves, as best suits their product, community, team, etc.
2016-03-10T17:17:46 <Justin_o> danayo: I need to use an e-mail that has a google account associated with it.. do you have something you\'d like to use
2016-03-10T17:18:24 <danayo> yes Justin_o, just emailed you
2016-03-10T17:18:31 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-03-10T17:18:50 <danayo> colinclark, this is good - i\'d like to add this to the intro
2016-03-10T17:18:59 <colinclark> the categorization you have used works really well to this end--Principles, Practices, Tools, Activities
2016-03-10T17:19:03 <colinclark> it\'s all there
2016-03-10T17:19:28 <colinclark> but if we want to use the term "guidelines," we should maybe describe how we see them as starting points, as repurposable, that sort of thing
2016-03-10T17:20:35 <danayo> sounds good colinclark, I\'ll add something to this effect in the intro
2016-03-10T17:20:54 <sepidehshahi> I totally agree with you colinclark. So maybe we could use another term instead of guidelines\xe2\x80\xa6

2016-03-10T21:21:59 <danayo> if it\'s ok, can we wait until Monday to start copying content into the cards? I think I\'d like to run it by folks first
2016-03-10T21:24:27 <sepidehshahi> danayo: they look great. absolutely. I have to do other things for 404.2 tomorrow. and I really like the high contrast versions as well

2016-03-10T21:27:35 <sepidehshahi> The only minor visual change I would make danayo is at the back of the cards, and left alighn the Do\xe2\x80\x99s and Try\xe2\x80\x99s sections with the Title of the card. Also if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible can we make the font header for those subsections (Do, Try ) a little bit heavier?

2016-03-10T21:32:23 <danayo> Yeah, I think the all caps makes the left alignment look weird somehow. I\'ll fix it up sepidehshahi
2016-03-10T21:33:27 <sepidehshahi> not a big deal danayo, I\xe2\x80\x99m just being too obsessed with alignments ;)

2016-03-10T21:52:50 <colinclark> a really nice clean and simple design
2016-03-10T21:53:03 <danayo> great colinclark
2016-03-10T21:53:39 <danayo> it was a collaborative effort with sepidehshahi
2016-03-10T21:53:46 <colinclark> they look awesome, sepidehshahi
2016-03-10T21:53:59 <colinclark> I think it would be great if sometime jhung can put the cards into a little navigable site with UIO
2016-03-10T21:54:08 <danayo> that would be great
2016-03-10T21:59:47 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea colinclark. hopefully we will have a full representation of them on the new IDRC website as well

2016-03-10T22:04:53 <danayo> yes, just had a quick look sepidehshahi, it looks great
2016-03-10T22:06:17 <sepidehshahi> I think google slide will be a good tool for live collaboration, at leaset at the wireframe stage

2016-03-10T15:37:22 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo. GPII Wiki is in pretty good shaps for the design guides:) how ready do you think we are for moving content to the card templates? if you have a final template we can split the work and start moving content to the template.
2016-03-10T15:40:09 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I need to spend some more time on the card design. perhaps for now we should stick with the original design that is posted already, and just provide examples (I think we discussed this and agreed that most important thing is to have the content available, right?)
2016-03-10T15:40:24 <danayo> I will work on the designs more today
2016-03-10T15:45:23 <sepidehshahi> for sure. yes the content was the first priority and I think we need the actual cards before the April review. So we still have some time:) I was just thinking about our next webinar which is in two weeks and I thought it would be great to show more than content and introduce them to the actual cards.
2016-03-10T15:45:27 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-03-10T15:45:48 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi

2016-03-10T16:15:22 <danayo> Justin_o, Bosmon, colinclark: I have put together the following 2 paragraphs to describe Infusion for the Inclusive Design Guidelines (taken from the Infusion site as well as notes from last summer\'s community meeting). Could you provide any feedback?
2016-03-10T16:15:24 <danayo> Infusion is a code framework for building flexible, adaptive applications and software systems using JavaScript and the Web (HTML). It is a growing collection of user interface components which are built on top of jQuery, and embraces unobtrusive, functional techniques that promote less code and greater flexibility. Infusion is separated into different functional parts so you can mix and match to easily build accessible things. It is
2016-03-10T16:15:25 <danayo> up of components that can have all their default parts and features taken apart and then different features, styling, and parts can be replaced and added.
2016-03-10T16:15:31 <danayo> Infusion brings users/people out of what we traditionally view as a role of consumption/use and puts them in a position where they can be actively engaged in the creative process. It provides an open modular system designed to be highly configurable so that anyone can modify and adapt it to create systems, applications, components, etc. that meet their specific use cases and needs. The Infusion framework reflects an accumulation of
2016-03-10T16:15:32 <danayo> experience about how to make applications accessible, and is as much about code as it is about documentation and community values.
2016-03-10T16:16:27 <colinclark> danayo: Can you paste it into a "viking pad" and we can hack on it together?
2016-03-10T16:16:41 <danayo> sure, good idea colinclark
2016-03-10T16:16:56 <colinclark> gtirloni: Remind me what the url for our new viking pad is?
2016-03-10T16:18:01 <danayo> ah, i thought viking pad was fancy speak for pirate pad colinclark :)
2016-03-10T16:18:06 <gtirloni> colinclark: pad.gpii.net
2016-03-10T16:18:09 <colinclark> oh yes
2016-03-10T16:18:22 <colinclark> danayo: It\'s a colloquialism for the new Etherpad that Alfredo set up
2016-03-10T16:18:30 <colinclark> one which actually runs reliably
2016-03-10T16:18:38 <danayo> cool, so I need to subscribe
2016-03-10T16:18:51 <colinclark> in honour of kasparnet
2016-03-10T16:18:56 <colinclark> yeah, i do too
2016-03-10T16:19:31 <danayo> oh, that was easy
2016-03-10T16:19:57 <colinclark> https://pad.gpii.net/p/infusion-9fp2wed?&auth_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJsb2dpbiI6ImNvbGluYmRjbGFyayIsImtleSI6ImNpbG1oYnloMDAwMGwyZ3F3eW81a2Vub2kiLCJpYXQiOjE0NTc2MjY3NTB9.P7H8mNdeC-j5zWfiyCImidnhJS3mcl4Ckgc43mq0Gvk
2016-03-10T16:20:01 <colinclark> Does that work?
2016-03-10T16:20:04 <colinclark> very long URL
2016-03-10T16:20:30 <danayo> looks good colinclark, i actually couldn\'t find a way to create a pad :(
2016-03-10T16:20:40 <colinclark> You had to make a folder first
2016-03-10T16:20:46 <colinclark> not a very good experience
2016-03-10T16:20:54 <colinclark> I think I just called my folder "Cats"
2016-03-10T16:21:02 <colinclark> for lack of having any reason whatsoever to make or name a folder
2016-03-10T16:21:03 <colinclark> :)
2016-03-10T16:21:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: hmm.. i clicked your link and it think i\'m you
2016-03-10T16:21:37 <colinclark> wow, Justin_o
2016-03-10T16:21:41 <colinclark> can I be you?
2016-03-10T16:21:43 <danayo> it\'s ALL YOU colinclark
2016-03-10T16:21:47 <colinclark> makes me think of that Replacements song
2016-03-10T16:21:49 <danayo> we\'re all you!!
2016-03-10T16:21:52 <colinclark> oh dear
2016-03-10T16:22:04 <danayo> why can\'t I be you
2016-03-10T16:22:44 <colinclark> I guess it has to do with the auth token in the URL
2016-03-10T16:22:49 <colinclark> what an insane application
2016-03-10T16:23:08 <colinclark> Does this work better? https://pad.gpii.net/p/infusion-9fp2wed
2016-03-10T16:23:21 <danayo> nope
2016-03-10T16:23:40 <colinclark> I guess it\'s something we should talk to amatas about
2016-03-10T16:23:52 <Justin_o> colinclark: no, i think you need to share your doc
2016-03-10T16:23:58 <colinclark> ?!
2016-03-10T16:24:00 <colinclark> What\'s that?
2016-03-10T16:24:44 <colinclark> How about now, with the link above?
2016-03-10T16:24:46 <colinclark> https://pad.gpii.net/p/infusion-9fp2wed
2016-03-10T16:24:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: just mean it\'s probably private
2016-03-10T16:25:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: it still thinks i\'m you
2016-03-10T16:25:12 <colinclark> Well
2016-03-10T16:25:19 <colinclark> This has been a great exercise in why to just use Google Docs
2016-03-10T16:25:54 <danayo> oh no!
2016-03-10T16:25:54 <colinclark> http://piratepad.net/cYS1sJ80WG
2016-03-10T16:26:04 <danayo> too funny

2016-03-10T16:43:57 <colinclark> and then I can hack on the design cards in the pirate pad if that works
2016-03-10T16:44:06 <danayo> sure sounds good colinclark
2016-03-10T16:44:10 <colinclark> I\'d love to read the Google Doc with all the design cards if you feel like sharing it
2016-03-10T16:44:15 <colinclark> just out of sheer curiosity and enthusiasm
2016-03-10T16:44:19 <danayo> for sure!
2016-03-10T16:44:50 <danayo> here is the link - last section https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoQCNCsbTjm5-1FTv-UixLyqWrkWtJNYHEe-SA1i-6I/edit?usp=sharing
2016-03-10T16:44:56 <danayo> also they are on the gpii wiki
2016-03-10T16:45:18 <danayo> (mostly)
2016-03-10T16:45:19 <danayo> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Inclusive_Design_Guildelines_for_Good_Practice
2016-03-10T16:46:13 <danayo> would love to hear any feedback colinclark
2016-03-10T16:46:32 <danayo> we wanted to get the content onto the wiki for P4A deadline
2016-03-10T16:46:43 <danayo> but they will remain a living document
2016-03-10T16:46:55 <colinclark> makes sense
2016-03-10T16:46:57 <colinclark> that\'s really good
2016-03-10T16:47:06 <colinclark> is the name a reference to thing that are covered in the other P4A deliverables
2016-03-10T16:47:15 <danayo> yes
2016-03-10T16:47:17 <colinclark> i.e. "Good Practice?"
2016-03-10T16:47:19 <danayo> yes
2016-03-10T16:47:28 <colinclark> Interesting
2016-03-10T16:47:31 <danayo> perhaps we could drop that part hto
2016-03-10T16:47:32 <danayo> tho
2016-03-10T16:47:38 <colinclark> I was thinking it was a bit awkward
2016-03-10T16:47:48 <colinclark> raising the question, "what IS good practice?"
2016-03-10T16:47:52 <danayo> right
2016-03-10T16:47:57 <danayo> also, the Practices thing
2016-03-10T16:48:06 <colinclark> What about something simple like "Design Strategies for Inclusion"
2016-03-10T16:48:07 <danayo> we have practices for good practice
2016-03-10T16:48:14 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-03-10T16:48:34 <danayo> What do you think of just "Inclusive Design Guildelines"?
2016-03-10T16:48:38 <colinclark> yeah, I can understand how these things emerge
2016-03-10T16:48:40 <colinclark> that\'s fine too
2016-03-10T16:48:44 <danayo> without the typo :)

2016-03-10T16:49:19 <colinclark> So is the "Good Practice" term from one of the D103s?
2016-03-10T16:49:52 <danayo> I believe so - I\'ll double check

2016-03-10T17:07:26 <danayo> sepidehshahi: the name "guidelines for good practice" came from the P4A DoW, right?
2016-03-10T17:07:48 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo
2016-03-10T17:10:01 <danayo> ok, colinclark was suggesting that perhaps we could lose the "good practice" part (see channel log 11:47)
2016-03-10T17:11:03 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: gtirloni has been helping us get back our google analytic accounts that we have running on our various sites... in looking at   some of the reporting it made me think it might be useful to you in regards to our chat with Jutta yesterday regarding the dashboard.
2016-03-10T17:11:24 <Justin_o> also might be useful for designing the IDRC site
2016-03-10T17:12:12 <sepidehshahi> interesting Justin_o, how can we access and see those reportings?
2016-03-10T17:12:28 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i\'ll see if i can add you...
2016-03-10T17:12:45 <sepidehshahi> or maybe just screen captures

2016-03-10T17:13:06 <Justin_o> you can look over my should now if you want to see if it/what would be useufl
2016-03-10T17:13:08 <Justin_o> useful

2016-03-10T17:14:24 <sepidehshahi> danayo and colinclark I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with either keeping or loosing the Good Practice part. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure strategies is a good term though, since not everything we say there is a strategy and I think guidelines fit better.
2016-03-10T17:14:40 <colinclark> Fair enough
2016-03-10T17:14:46 <colinclark> I don\'t have a problem with "guidelines"
2016-03-10T17:14:54 <colinclark> they\'re not prescriptive at least
2016-03-10T17:15:12 <danayo> Justin_o I wish I could look over your shoulder
2016-03-10T17:15:13 <colinclark> but I like the the thought that what we do is give people a set of resources and perspectives
2016-03-10T17:15:30 <colinclark> which they can use and adapt and deploy in their own ways
