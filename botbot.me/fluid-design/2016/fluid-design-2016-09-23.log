2016-09-23T13:43:37 <jhung> gtirloni: Those pop-overs really need to go away.
2016-09-23T13:44:22 <jhung> The most insulting are the slow loading sites which give you all the content, and then a massive pop-over appears. Nothing makes me close a tab faster\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-09-23T13:45:37 <gtirloni> no kidding, it\'s pretty annoying
2016-09-23T13:47:48 <jhung> If I really need to see the content below, I don\'t even click the "close" button - I open the debugger and delete the element. It\'s just my little way of rebelling against the system.
2016-09-23T13:48:27 <gtirloni> haha you\'re messing with their stats ("how many people close the popup?") :)
2016-09-23T13:49:15 <jhung> rather they\'re thinking: "Wow, this one person really stared at the pop-over for a long time". :D
