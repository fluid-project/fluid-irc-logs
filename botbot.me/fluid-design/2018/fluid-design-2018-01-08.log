2018-01-08T16:02:05 <danayo> for anyone interested here is the link to the SJRK Activities page content https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/0ij56jxy5OdHT2X
2018-01-08T16:02:12 <danayo> grrrero: I have switched channels :)
2018-01-08T16:02:28 <grrrero> danayo: :)
2018-01-08T16:05:38 <danayo> grrrero: the Resources page looks great! one thing - I think we need to increase the padding between the two columns - I would double it
2018-01-08T16:05:55 <grrrero> danayo: Yeah sounds like a good idea!
2018-01-08T16:10:12 <danayo> also grrrero: can we override the default link text styling and make it black instead of blue
2018-01-08T16:10:27 <grrrero> danayo: Sure -- was wondering if you wanted to do that for the entire site?
2018-01-08T16:10:34 <grrrero> I didn't touch it because I wasn't sure
2018-01-08T16:11:19 <danayo> I think that would be good grrrero
2018-01-08T16:11:28 <danayo> for visited links I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure - I think when there\xe2\x80\x99s a long list it\xe2\x80\x99s handy
2018-01-08T16:12:01 <danayo> so let\xe2\x80\x99s keep the default styling for now
2018-01-08T16:12:08 <danayo> for visited links I mean
2018-01-08T16:13:30 <grrrero> Ok but new links are black
2018-01-08T16:13:49 <danayo> yes grrrero

2018-01-08T17:02:08 <alanharnum> thanks danayo, will have a look
2018-01-08T17:03:06 <danayo> thanks
2018-01-08T17:05:46 <michelled> danayo: I think we should have a blurb for what we are doing too
2018-01-08T17:05:56 <danayo> michelled: ah! of course!!
2018-01-08T17:05:58 <danayo> :D

2018-01-08T17:06:10 <michelled> including the storytelling tool and the infrastructure work that Gio is doing
2018-01-08T17:06:14 <michelled> haha
2018-01-08T17:06:50 <danayo> ok, I wonder if gtirloni has some time to write up a quick summary?
2018-01-08T17:07:16 <danayo> gtirloni: this is for the SJRK website - we\xe2\x80\x99re updating the Activity page to reflect the work that\xe2\x80\x99s going on
2018-01-08T17:08:16 <danayo> would just need a few sentences
2018-01-08T17:09:19 <gtirloni> ahm.. i'm investigating the resources available to use Git as a database for the storytelling tool, but not actually creating anything (no code/prototype), just documenting that for now
2018-01-08T17:12:19 <danayo> ok thanks gtirloni

2018-01-08T18:43:47 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, I am going to pickup MyL3 work. I think we last talked about it during a design crit in October, I could find the meeting notes. Do you think if there was any other discussion or meetings that I may have forgotten?
2018-01-08T18:48:59 <danayo> let me take a look sepidehshahi

2018-01-08T20:23:44 <alanharnum> looks like we'll need to reschedule the BIT design crit for next week - does anyone have anything they'd like to talk about tomorrow instead?
2018-01-08T20:23:56 <alanharnum> danayo lliskovoi sepidehshahi in particular ^
2018-01-08T20:24:52 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: I think Justin_o could use the time to discuss potential GSoC projects
2018-01-08T20:25:26 <danayo> sepidehshahi: sorry for the delay! you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to these notes, right? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/October+3+2017+-+MyL3+Design+Crit
2018-01-08T20:26:15 <danayo> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had any discussion about it since then
2018-01-08T20:26:26 * clown joined the channel
2018-01-08T20:27:45 <sepidehshahi> you are right! I think we only dsicussed our personal tracking experience in a crit but we did not connect that to the design of MyL3
2018-01-08T20:29:37 <alanharnum> Justin_o is meeting w/colinclark and michelled right now but i'll ask him & send out an update
2018-01-08T20:29:45 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99ll start working on the designs based on the crit feedback tomorrow and if you have time this Thursday, we can meet to touch base about the design updates and next steps
2018-01-08T20:30:00 <sepidehshahi> thanks alanharnum
2018-01-08T20:30:39 <danayo> that sounds good sepidehshahi
2018-01-08T20:30:54 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks
2018-01-08T20:30:56 <danayo> that\xe2\x80\x99s right  - the personal tracking meeting was really informative too
2018-01-08T20:31:04 <danayo> you have the link to those notes sepidehshahi ?
2018-01-08T20:31:17 <danayo> I never did post them - I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear back from anyone about it so I left it
2018-01-08T20:31:35 <danayo> left it in the google doc that is
2018-01-08T20:32:15 <sepidehshahi> no worries danayo, I have access to the google doc
