2018-04-17T13:37:45 <jhung> fluid-everyone - today\'s design crit has been cancelled due to a last minute illness. The topic will be rescheduled for a future date.
2018-04-17T13:47:46 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I owe you a review of the Create-a-Thon document, don\'t I?
2018-04-17T13:48:56 <sepidehshahi> No worries jhung :) I was just about to send you and danayo some comments about the entery.
2018-04-17T13:49:42 <jhung> thanks sepidehshahi. I hope to get to it this week as I\'m away next week on vaca.
2018-04-17T13:49:59 <sepidehshahi> that would be great jhung! thank you

2018-04-17T15:35:43 <carenwatkins> fluid-everyone: I\'m having vidyo connection problems. Could be internet connection issues (lots of problems over here due to the storm, several repair trucks on street to fix problems as I type) or my new system not playing well with apps. I\'m investigating. In the meantime I will go through the Iteration Plan and update anything relevant. My update: mostly SNOW related tasks. Last week I was at the ASET conference,
2018-04-17T15:35:43 <carenwatkins> created promo and distributed in an attempt to up registration for a workshop (unfortunately we had to cancel it this morning), tending to social media and starting to integrate tagline: Inclusive Learning and Education, investigating updates on Google Analytics Data Retention and the General Data Protection Regulation and how it effects SNOW. This afternoon: investigating four articles on SNOW Drupal site that look to

2018-04-17T18:30:34 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung: and Justin_o I have added all the markups for Jutta\xe2\x80\x99s Three Dimension articles and they are ready to be added to ILDH. The only things missing are the images. I have already added placeholder images to the docs, so I just need to get an url for the real images and paste them in the source files. Do you know how I could do that?
2018-04-17T18:33:02 <jhung> sepidehshahi: in your local copy of the ILDH, you need to put the images into the ./src/static/images/ directory first.
2018-04-17T18:34:18 <jhung> Then in the document, you will need to add the path to the image. For example if the image is located in ./src/static/images/3-dimensions.jpg, the document should reference /images/3-dimensions.jpg
2018-04-17T18:34:33 <jhung> Is that what you were wondering?
2018-04-17T18:34:49 <sepidehshahi> This is very helpful! thanks so much jhung
2018-04-17T18:35:35 <jhung> no problem sepidehshahi. Some of the existing documents in the guide should have an example for you to follow (i.e. the Web activity)
2018-04-17T18:35:38 <sepidehshahi> let me try that and if I had a problem I\xe2\x80\x99ll ping you again
2018-04-17T18:39:08 <jhung> ok
