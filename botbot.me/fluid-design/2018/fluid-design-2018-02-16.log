2018-02-16T13:42:35 <Caren_> morning jhung
2018-02-16T13:42:47 <jhung> Hi Caren_
2018-02-16T13:43:55 <Caren_> when you have a second can you pop on to the co-design doc mapped out yesterday\xe2\x80\xa6just want to clarify some of the logistics so I understand it better.
2018-02-16T13:44:33 <Caren_> I\xe2\x80\x99m still a little confused by the two players and their roles. Maybe we can flesh that out a bit.
2018-02-16T13:46:12 <jhung> ok Caren_
2018-02-16T13:48:40 <Caren_> thanks jhung

2018-02-16T14:17:23 <jhung> Caren_: good questions in the doc. I\'ve revised bits and pieces - does it make more sense now?

2018-02-16T14:22:26 <Caren_> what program are you doing that in? Illustrator?
2018-02-16T14:23:17 <jhung> Just Google draw. You can go to "Insert" > "Drawing" from the document menu.

2018-02-16T17:36:31 <Caren_> everyone: chatting with PhET folks and there is a question: Fusion (combination of JAWS and Zoomtext). Question for IDRC folks, do you have any experience with Fusion or seen users using Fusion?
