2018-04-19T14:30:59 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I suppose this would count as sonification. At any rate, I find it rather pleasing to listen to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6va6tg62qg

2018-04-19T15:55:17 <grrrero> jessm: :)
2018-04-19T15:55:40 <jessm> she\'s an amazing writer, an ace live-tweeter -- she has MANY talents
2018-04-19T15:55:51 <grrrero> jessm: She also illustrates and makes zines :)
2018-04-19T15:56:09 <jessm> grrrero: really?! is there anything she *doesn\'t* do?
2018-04-19T15:56:25 <grrrero> jessm: Yet to be determined hahaha

2018-04-19T15:57:48 <jessm> danayo: the tweet she sent out for the panel is one of the top tweets for the Summit. and it\'s been shared pretty widely... lemme find that too
2018-04-19T15:58:20 <danayo> great, thanks jessm

2018-04-19T15:59:36 <jessm> i mean, i\'m trying not to be creepy, but i kind of think she\'s amazing :P
2018-04-19T16:05:58 <danayo> she is definitely doing some super cool work jessm, grrrero!
2018-04-19T16:08:16 <jessm> There were also some folks at york doing work around indigenous intellectual property
2018-04-19T16:08:23 <jessm> and i think it\'s safe there is more to come
2018-04-19T16:18:24 <jessm> danayo: and grrrero all sessions at the Summit had note-takers and it\'s all online
2018-04-19T16:18:49 <grrrero> Awesome jessm danayo :)
2018-04-19T16:18:56 <danayo> great jessm !

2018-04-19T16:28:15 <jessm> and i\'m going to dig into what happened in Bristol the last few days at #oer18 https://oer18.oerconf.org/programme/#/day2
2018-04-19T16:28:34 <jessm> there were some good tweets coming out of there about inclusion and OER and the Global South and different needs, etc.

2018-04-19T20:55:55 <colinclark> simonjb, I was just thinking of one thing...
2018-04-19T20:56:04 <colinclark> this question of data governance is quite complex
2018-04-19T20:56:20 <colinclark> i was reading some theory recently about "platforms"
2018-04-19T20:56:35 <colinclark> and in the way that theory sometimes is, there was some funny terminology that the authors made up
2018-04-19T20:56:42 <colinclark> which they called "plat-formatting"
2018-04-19T20:57:06 <simonjb> interesting
2018-04-19T20:57:08 <colinclark> but it speaks to the issue of the way sensors that gather data, and the data that is gathered, is actually hard to separate
2018-04-19T20:57:15 <simonjb> I\'m still very new to it
2018-04-19T20:57:45 <colinclark> the example they used was the ways in which the on-board graphics chips on a phone these days do certain preprocessing or optimization to the image
2018-04-19T20:57:59 <colinclark> in order to make it most amenable to, say, recognizing faces in the images
2018-04-19T20:58:38 <colinclark> and so even data governance, perhaps in the form of a cooperative, still requires some form of trust or governance over the sensor, too
2018-04-19T20:58:55 <colinclark> what does it do to produce the data? what things are filtered out?
2018-04-19T20:59:02 <colinclark> or emphasized
2018-04-19T20:59:03 <simonjb> so the form of the data is not independent of the sensor details?
2018-04-19T20:59:03 <colinclark> or whatever
2018-04-19T20:59:06 <colinclark> yes
2018-04-19T20:59:08 <colinclark> exactly
2018-04-19T20:59:14 <simonjb> yes, this makes sense to me
2018-04-19T20:59:35 <colinclark> and that sensors may choose to "optimize away" useful "outlier" data
2018-04-19T20:59:40 <simonjb> yes
2018-04-19T20:59:46 <colinclark> we kind of imagine that sensors are these passive gatherers
2018-04-19T20:59:54 <colinclark> that send "raw" data to some server somewhere
2018-04-19T21:00:05 <colinclark> and that it\'s the machine learning algorithms that bias the data
2018-04-19T21:00:05 <simonjb> right
2018-04-19T21:00:19 <colinclark> but the platform extends directly to the level of sensing
2018-04-19T21:00:22 <simonjb> and this is likely to happen more and more with time
2018-04-19T21:00:29 <colinclark> definitely
2018-04-19T21:00:38 <simonjb> to optimize sensor cost
2018-04-19T21:00:43 <colinclark> yup
2018-04-19T21:00:48 <simonjb> sensor + processing on a chip
2018-04-19T21:00:51 <colinclark> yup
2018-04-19T21:00:59 <colinclark> my sense is that Apple is leading the way here in some respects
2018-04-19T21:01:05 <colinclark> and perhaps for very good reasons
2018-04-19T21:01:06 <simonjb> application-specific sensing
2018-04-19T21:01:13 <simonjb> ok
2018-04-19T21:01:13 <colinclark> for user privacy, for example
2018-04-19T21:01:29 <colinclark> whereas Google sends a lot to their cloud, apple will do more and more "smart" things on the phone
2018-04-19T21:01:36 <colinclark> optimized by dedicated chips or subsystems of their chips
2018-04-19T21:01:49 <colinclark> I have no idea if that\'s true, I just have this impression
2018-04-19T21:01:52 <simonjb> yes you could imagine an argument that only filtered data leaving the sensor as a privacy argument
2018-04-19T21:02:00 <colinclark> based on their ML libraries for the iPhone
2018-04-19T21:02:07 <colinclark> it seems like a lot can happen because of their hardware
2018-04-19T21:02:13 <colinclark> yup, a very GPII-esque argument :)
2018-04-19T21:02:58 <simonjb> and entirely connected to the discussion from yesterday\'s meeting about "auditing" the sensors
2018-04-19T21:03:54 <simonjb> this is super interesting
