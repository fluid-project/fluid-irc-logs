2018-08-20T17:06:05 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I missed standup, I had a very busy and early morning, went to take a quick 20-minute nap before starting my work day but forgot that Special Relativity applies to sleep and it turned into 3 hours :O
2018-08-20T17:06:05 <gmoss> My update: on Friday, I started to refactor my code for FLUID-6300, filed a couple of new Jiras (FLUID-6322 and 6323), and spent the rest of the day reviewing code for one of our Inclusive Game GSoC students. Today I plan to wrap up my refactoring and start adding tests, and to review the other student's code.
2018-08-20T17:07:26 <gmoss> and we're having a meeting at 2 for our final review of both students
2018-08-20T17:17:19 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I've merged in the pull request for the website post and will head into the office soon

2018-08-20T17:32:03 <danayo> hey Justin_o do you want to join that call with Mundano next Monday? You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be there, but it might be a good chance to promote the community meetings and get a commitment from them. But I can also ask about it
