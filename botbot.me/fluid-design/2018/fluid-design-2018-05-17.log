2018-05-17T15:19:23 <carenwatkins_> Hello all. Have been working remotely this morning and am now making my way to the IDRC for a lunch at 12:30 and then in the offices after that. Standup update: yesterday Eloisa and I connected about SNOW and discovered some navigation structure oddities. I continue to comb through SNOW content and considering ways to thread the content with inclusive learning principles and structure. Did some social media, outreach t
2018-05-17T15:19:24 <carenwatkins_> potential article writers and some admin bits and pieces.

2018-05-17T19:14:32 <jhung> carenwatkins: got a question for you.
2018-05-17T19:15:01 <carenwatkins> hi jhung fire away
2018-05-17T19:16:05 <jhung> In Faraday\'s law say a user has chosen to jump the magnet to the other side of the play area. The magnet begins to move across the screen and keyboard focus is still on the magnet.
2018-05-17T19:16:34 <jhung> What do you think should happen if the user presses Tab to move focus carenwatkins? Should the magnet continue or should it stop?
2018-05-17T19:21:25 <carenwatkins> jhung: my first reaction is the magnet should continue the jump as the user changes focus to do other activities\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-17T19:22:59 <jhung> carenwatkins: that was my first thought as well, but I\'m thinking it\'d be less confusing if it stopped when focus moved.
2018-05-17T19:23:21 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering when that might happen\xe2\x80\xa6start jump and change polarity as it is jumping\xe2\x80\xa6jhung
2018-05-17T19:23:44 <carenwatkins> is that too complex, as you say jhung
2018-05-17T19:24:18 <jhung> carenwatkins: yeah that\'s my feeling. I just wanted to get your thoughts on it before I bake it into the design.
2018-05-17T19:30:17 <carenwatkins> I think that makes sense jhung. If a user changes focus as the magnet is moving I assume they are changing focus to activate something else, therefore, the magnet should stop. Unlike say BASE where a balloon may continue to move even after focus moves away from it.
2018-05-17T19:31:41 <jhung> carenwatkins: awesome thanks for the thoughts.

2018-05-17T19:44:16 <simonjb> Justin_o: I just posted about the Microsoft Xbox Adaptive Controller on the community list, thought your students might be interested in it

2018-05-17T19:45:59 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2018-05-17T19:46:17 <Justin_o> janardan: Please see the link that simonjb posted above
2018-05-17T19:46:36 <janardan> Justin_o: k thx
2018-05-17T19:48:04 <simonjb> it\'s pretty neat -- the controller has some controls on it and then acts as a hub for attaching joystick and a bunch of switch inputs
2018-05-17T19:48:22 <simonjb> scheduled to launch later this year
2018-05-17T19:51:18 <simonjb> it has 2 usb joystick inputs and 19 3.5mm jacks for switches
2018-05-17T19:51:29 <Justin_o> simonjb: have you heard if it will support Windows or just Xbox?
2018-05-17T19:51:35 <simonjb> rather 3.5mm sockets
2018-05-17T19:52:12 <simonjb> I imagine Windows also, I think it appears as an Xbox One S controller
2018-05-17T19:52:21 <simonjb> which works on Windows
2018-05-17T19:52:43 <jhung> Windows 10 support coming later.
2018-05-17T19:53:24 <simonjb> "XAC\'s ease of use first becomes apparent when you connect it to a compatible machine like an Xbox One or computer. At that point, it is essentially recognized as a wireless Xbox One S controller"
2018-05-17T19:54:11 <simonjb> "All Xbox One consoles, and any Windows 10 machine with a $25 Xbox Wireless Adapter, will play nice with XAC right out of the box."

2018-05-17T20:02:31 * jhung has quit
2018-05-17T20:03:00 <simonjb> I use an Xbox One S controller on my Windows PC at home so hopefully this new XAC would work the same

2018-05-17T20:18:17 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks.. i couldn\'t see a price listed yet
2018-05-17T20:18:35 <Justin_o> hope it\'s roughly the same price as their standard controllers
2018-05-17T20:18:44 <Justin_o> although controllers in general are getting expensive
2018-05-17T20:18:52 <simonjb> the article says $100
2018-05-17T20:19:03 <Justin_o> oh i missed that
2018-05-17T20:19:08 <Justin_o> that\'s not too bad
2018-05-17T20:19:36 <Justin_o> it was right at the top of the article
2018-05-17T20:19:47 <Justin_o> so i guess it\'ll be about $150 or so here
2018-05-17T20:20:09 <simonjb> yeah, not super-cheap but still pretty good I think
2018-05-17T20:20:32 <simonjb> especially if it works as smoothly as hoped
2018-05-17T20:22:12 <Justin_o> yes true.. hope we can get one to play with
2018-05-17T20:23:48 <simonjb> more about it here: https://news.microsoft.com/stories/xbox-adaptive-controller/
