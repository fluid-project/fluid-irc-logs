2018-07-10T19:27:57 <sophiewu> hi! i got my irc set up but i have to be physically connectd to the ocad u network wifi through an adapter for now in the lab (apparently the issue was that i was on the guest ocad wifi before\xe2\x80\x94am getting my own wifi account in a couple of days, so ill just bear with this for now) feel free to add me on Skype (my username is unmeiia) if you want to message me quickly when im not onsite, sorry for the trouble aha and let me know what
2018-07-10T19:27:57 <sophiewu> can do for the inclusive cities project this week:D
2018-07-10T19:33:26 <sophiewu> whoops i meant to send that to just sepideh super sorry still figuring out how to use this!

2018-07-10T20:57:20 <Justin_o> danayo: do we have play and pause icons that we could add to fluid-icons. It would help with consistency for the self voicing component I\'m working on
2018-07-10T20:58:07 <Justin_o> i\'m just using what\'s in the font,  but then i have to make sure that font shows up on all the systems anyways to make sure that it looks properly across platforms

2018-07-10T21:03:00 <danayo> hey Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what we have, or if we\xe2\x80\x99d have to create something
2018-07-10T21:03:30 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, i couldn\'t find them in the fluid-icons repo https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/tree/master/svg
2018-07-10T21:04:05 <Justin_o> maybe we have them in owncloud but if not, I guess it would have to be made.
2018-07-10T21:04:19 <Justin_o> do you know if that would be hard and if we have someone who would be able to help with that?
2018-07-10T21:07:20 <danayo> I wonder if lliskovoi might have time? shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too much work I don\xe2\x80\x99t think...
2018-07-10T21:08:01 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-07-10T21:08:58 <lliskovoi> danayo, Justin_o , I can create them
2018-07-10T21:09:18 <danayo> lliskovoi: hurrah! thanks
2018-07-10T21:09:27 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: thanks so much.
2018-07-10T21:09:50 <lliskovoi> no prob Justin_o, danayo! What is it for? Any specifications?
2018-07-10T21:10:39 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: it\'ll get added to the infusion-icons repo https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons
2018-07-10T21:11:01 <Justin_o> A couple things to look at would be https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Icons+Visual+Style+Guide
2018-07-10T21:11:21 <Justin_o> and https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Standard+workflow+in+maintaining+and+creating+icon+fonts
2018-07-10T21:11:31 <Justin_o> I think there is a master icons file in ownCloud
2018-07-10T21:11:36 <lliskovoi> Is there a work file I can use for reference in terms of size/dimensions
2018-07-10T21:11:42 <lliskovoi> read my mind Justin_o!
2018-07-10T21:11:46 <Justin_o> :)
2018-07-10T21:11:57 <Justin_o> it looks like the location is detailed in the last link i pasted
2018-07-10T21:12:33 <danayo> thanks to neuralmilkhotel\xe2\x80\x99s excellent work :)
2018-07-10T21:12:37 <Justin_o> the link on the wiki page doesn\'t seem to work, but the location is "IDRC-Design > Inclusive Resources and Tools > Design Templates > Infusion-icons.ai"
2018-07-10T21:12:45 <Justin_o> yes, thanks neuralmilkhotel  :)
2018-07-10T21:13:58 <neuralmilkhotel> danayo Justin_o \xf0\x9f\x98\x81
2018-07-10T21:17:07 <lliskovoi> Justin_o neuralmilkhotel danayo I\'ll can create the svgs but I\'ll need help with the other steps
2018-07-10T21:19:09 <neuralmilkhotel> Can help you out lliskovoi
2018-07-10T21:19:21 <neuralmilkhotel> Lemme know if you get stuck

2018-07-10T21:24:20 <Justin_o> lliskovoi, neuralmilkhotel: thanks.. sorry to run, but need to head off.. i\'ll sync up with you tomorrow and can help out then if needed. Thanks again.
2018-07-10T21:26:15 <lliskovoi> Justin_o neuralmilkhotel danayo is it possible that I should be using IDRC Design > Visual Resources > Icons >I nfusion_Icons_Library_V1_SS instead?
2018-07-10T21:26:27 <lliskovoi> That one seems more consistent with the style guide
2018-07-10T21:26:36 <lliskovoi> and has more icons
2018-07-10T21:27:42 <neuralmilkhotel> Oh yes pls use that, sepidehshahi made some changes to it lliskovoi
2018-07-10T21:28:11 <lliskovoi> sounds good neuralmilkhotel!
2018-07-10T21:28:40 <neuralmilkhotel> np lliskovoi
2018-07-10T21:28:51 <danayo> glad you know what\xe2\x80\x99s what neuralmilkhotel!
2018-07-10T21:29:17 * neuralmilkhotel wipes sweat off forehead \xf0\x9f\x98\x85
2018-07-10T21:42:26 <lliskovoi> neuralmilkhotel exported the icons, could you help me with the GitHub stuff tomorrow? I\'m pretty clueless when it comes to GitHub
2018-07-10T21:42:37 <neuralmilkhotel> For sure lliskovoi !! :)
2018-07-10T21:42:54 <lliskovoi> Justin_o: when do you need these? (the icons are done but I\'m at a loss for next steps and need neuralmilkhotel\'s help!)
2018-07-10T21:43:17 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o said he could touch base tomorrow so I don\'t think they are needed today lliskovoi ?
2018-07-10T21:43:27 <lliskovoi> thanks neuralmilkhotel! Should they be saved in a different place? There are not other icon svg files in that folder
2018-07-10T21:43:46 <neuralmilkhotel> You can save them in owncloud for now (as backup) and/or in your local machine :)
2018-07-10T21:44:16 <lliskovoi> Ok, I\'ll keep them in that folder then and we\'ll sort it out tomorrow. Thanks again!
2018-07-10T21:46:58 <neuralmilkhotel> np lliskovoi !
