2018-01-05T03:55:40 <ussjoin> danayo and gtirlioni: I know you're not in here now, but hoping you'll see the scrollback in the morning. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208331 confirms that the patches for Meltdown/Spectre that MacOS put out did come out for El Capitan 10.11.6, Sierra 10.12.6, and High Sierra 10.13.1. So you don't have to upgrade to High Sierra just to get this fix, despite them kind of implying that on the other page.

2018-01-05T15:51:38 <sepidehshahi> Hi gmoss, I am looking for non-classroom related examples for learning diversity. I was wondering if there are any projects or examples that I could share from the SJRK partners
2018-01-05T15:53:08 <gmoss> Hi sepidehshahi! Hmm, nothing springs to mind right away, let me give it some thought..
2018-01-05T15:53:56 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks.
2018-01-05T16:09:56 <gmoss> I can't recall any specific examples that would fit your requirements, at the moment. I think for those partners who are doing work involving learning diversity, they're all involved in some way or another with the education system, generally re-engaging youth in learning
2018-01-05T16:10:16 <gmoss> I'll let you know if anything comes to me :)

2018-01-05T16:15:50 <Caren_> hi sepidehshahi : what sort of examples are you looking for\xe2\x80\xa6single lived experiences or perhaps organizations that support learning differences?
2018-01-05T16:16:08 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-01-05T16:18:15 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: maybe the latter. We have included an example about PhET in the document, however, it is still related to the conventional education system. So, any other example from activist groups or youth movements would be a great addition
2018-01-05T16:24:45 <gmoss> sepidehshahi: perhaps Silvia's work with groups like the Environmental Guardians applies, actually. I think they're all students, but it's not always a classroom context
2018-01-05T16:25:05 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: I may have mentioned Specialisterne before. A friend who counsels and places folks with cognitive differences in jobs praised this org: http://ca.specialisterne.com/about-specialisterne/our-logo-the-dandelion-seed/

2018-01-05T16:26:44 <sepidehshahi> This is great! thanks Caren_ and gmoss do you know where I can read more about Silvia\xe2\x80\x99s work?
2018-01-05T16:28:29 <danayo> sepidehshahi: just popping on here briefly and saw your request - here is an org that Karisma (SJRK partner) in Colombia is working with http://platohedro.org/d-formacion/
2018-01-05T16:28:56 <sepidehshahi> awesome! thanks a lot danayo
2018-01-05T16:29:36 <gmoss> sepidehshahi: I'll see if I can find any links, but in the meantime danayo's work that we looked at yesterday has a nice summary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STpz1pWj7p8ir-wJlAPCLUIOHWtArT3jqQZju49vtso/edit
2018-01-05T16:29:49 <gmoss> I was thinking about Futco's work
2018-01-05T16:30:31 <gmoss> danayo is probably a better resource for this information, since it's all super fresh in her mind :)
2018-01-05T16:31:19 <sepidehshahi> Thank you all for sharing these resources
