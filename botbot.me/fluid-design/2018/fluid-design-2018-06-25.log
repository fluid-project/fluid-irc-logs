2018-06-25T18:47:45 <jhung> gmoss, alanharnum: for tomorrow\'s design crit, can you give a single sentence summary of what it will be about?
2018-06-25T18:48:51 <gmoss> jhung: perhaps something like "Examining the software design and architecture of the SJRK Storytelling Tool, and the development implications of the same" ? alanharnum perhaps we should meet to discuss this today
2018-06-25T18:52:51 <gmoss> jhung: did I send you the document that I wrote up a couple of weeks ago?
2018-06-25T18:52:55 <gmoss> about the crit
2018-06-25T18:53:25 <gmoss> it\'s still in what I\'d call a draft state, but may be helpful. that said the nature of the crit may not be in line with what I\'ve written
2018-06-25T18:53:38 <jhung> Ok. I\'ll have to go back and check gmoss.
2018-06-25T18:55:27 <jhung> gmoss: I think "Examining the software design and architecture of the SJRK Storytelling Tool" is a good line for the weekly email. I\'ll use that. Feel free to follow up in the community email with any additional information.
2018-06-25T18:55:52 <gmoss> jhung: sounds good to me!
2018-06-25T18:56:17 <gmoss> I wonder if it\'s worth expanding the SJRK acronym
2018-06-25T18:56:47 <jhung> yep. Good call gmoss
2018-06-25T18:56:50 <michelled> I wonder if we should actually drop the SJRK
2018-06-25T18:56:50 <michelled> :)
2018-06-25T18:57:03 <michelled> it\'s the storytelling tool - many projects make it
2018-06-25T18:57:15 <gmoss> very true michelled
2018-06-25T18:57:18 <jhung> ok
2018-06-25T18:58:11 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-06-25T18:59:15 <jhung> alanharnum: I was going to send out the weekly email on the design crit. I\'ll be describing it as "Alan and Gregor will lead an examination of the software design and architecture of the Storytelling Tool".
2018-06-25T18:59:30 <alanharnum> jhung: sounds good to me! gmoss? ^
2018-06-25T18:59:58 <gmoss> jhung alanharnum: yep! :)
2018-06-25T19:00:04 <jhung> Awesome. Thanks!
