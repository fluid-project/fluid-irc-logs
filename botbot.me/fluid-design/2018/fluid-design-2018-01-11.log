2018-01-11T19:33:27 <Justin_o> @danayo, do you have time today to talk about the icons for the UIO adjusters?
2018-01-11T19:47:20 <danayo_> hi Justin_o, was in a meeting, sorry. here is the file that we worked with last time https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/IfISxG0BWfnZzhJ
2018-01-11T19:47:43 <danayo_> Caren spent some time on it as well but I don't have her version
2018-01-11T19:48:35 <danayo_> I wonder, sepidehshahi, if you have time and want to do some work on these icons?
2018-01-11T19:49:25 <sepidehshahi> Sure danayo_ I can work on these icons. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk with Justin_o
2018-01-11T19:49:55 <danayo_> some of the things we talked about last time Justin_o, sepidehshahi  that I remember, was trying to eliminate any language/locale dependence
2018-01-11T19:50:42 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a great point
2018-01-11T19:51:21 <danayo_> great sepidehshahi, thanks!
2018-01-11T19:51:29 <sepidehshahi> yw
