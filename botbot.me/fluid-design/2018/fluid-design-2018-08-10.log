2018-08-10T14:29:00 <Caren_> jhung: the Twitter feed on SNOW is not rendering images. Is that something that can be changed in the setting?
2018-08-10T14:38:36 <jhung> Caren_: I see. I\'m not sure! Images have shown up there before, right?

2018-08-10T15:19:56 <Caren_> jhung: good question. I believe they have but it\xe2\x80\x99s a new-ish widget. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure.
2018-08-10T15:22:09 <jhung> looking now Caren_
2018-08-10T15:22:33 <Caren_> thanks jhung
2018-08-10T15:23:28 <jhung> Caren_: unrelated note, is it okay I change "Check for new tweets"  from every 1 hour to every 4 hours?
2018-08-10T15:24:57 <Caren_> jhung: sure, makes sense
2018-08-10T15:29:26 * Bosmon joined the channel
2018-08-10T15:33:07 <jhung> Caren_: it appears displaying images is a "Pro" feature and demands a tribute.

2018-08-10T15:37:32 <Caren_> Vidyo isn\xe2\x80\x99t cooperating at the moment. Update: Jon and I spoke about SNOW this morning. Launch is planned for the 23rd with a maintenance page up while we address all internal links. Continuing to upload/edit/write content on SNOW. SNOW report due end of August, starting to map that out. Travelling beginning of next week and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be remote from Mexico until the end of August.
2018-08-10T15:39:33 <Caren_> jhung: does that mean $? not sure what a tribute is.
2018-08-10T15:39:54 <jhung> Caren_: yep - an annual subscription.
2018-08-10T15:41:36 <gmoss> for whomever is interested, reposting Alan\'s article link from yesterday: https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/08/07/securing-sites-made-them-less-accessible/
2018-08-10T15:42:00 <Caren_> Ugh. given the big void that is rendered on the site maybe we should limit the box size and allow tweets to fill that space? jhung
2018-08-10T15:43:04 <jhung> It only appears that way Caren_ because the tweet text is short. We can show 2 more tweets and maybe that would look better?
2018-08-10T15:46:12 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-08-10T15:48:01 <Caren_> jhung: ya, I realize there is little text in that tweet. We often retweet this type of thing. The challenge with allowing a specific number of tweets is the box \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d will change accordingly and then the boxes to the right will have voids. Not sure which is a better solution. Perhaps we need to make sure there is more text in our retweets. It would be good practice anyways\xe2\x80\x94descriptive text of the visual.
2018-08-10T15:48:29 <Caren_> *boxes to the left
2018-08-10T15:49:25 <Caren_> I\xe2\x80\x99ll retweet with more text\xe2\x80\xa6solved. thanks jhung
2018-08-10T15:51:28 <jhung> Caren_: I don\'t know if more text is necessarily the answer, but I agree that if the image isn\'t displaying then the retweet should be a bit more descriptive.

2018-08-10T15:53:22 <Caren_> jhung: sorry, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I meant\xe2\x80\xa6will retweet more descriptive text when the meaning of the tweet is communicated in a visual
2018-08-10T15:56:21 <jhung> awesome Caren_!
2018-08-10T15:56:47 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Does anyone have a topic for next week\'s design crit?
