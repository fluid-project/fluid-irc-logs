b"2018-02-28T21:21:45 <danayo> alanharnum: the content in the google doc is in pretty good shape. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good bit of content in there for the tornado section too - I\xe2\x80\x99ll add a few more edits but wondered if you still want to work on that section too? Otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99ll plow ahead
2018-02-28T21:21:51 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2018-02-28T21:22:22 <alanharnum> danayo: I'm on a CAST meeting right now so I'd say go on and plow ahead - I will add some things if I think of them
2018-02-28T21:22:30 <danayo> ok thanks alanharnum

2018-02-28T21:38:02 <danayo> sepidehshahi I think this is in pretty good shape. if you have a chance to take a look that would be great (but also ok if you are busy!) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TqFz0_df8IQTLEc0Ibr-_0gkDc3LDfE8v7AfAWsw4xw/edit?usp=sharing
2018-02-28T21:41:14 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I was just going through it. it is looking great! did Jutta send you more photos?
2018-02-28T21:42:02 <danayo> no she didnt\xe2\x80\x99 sepidehshahi
2018-02-28T21:43:03 <sepidehshahi> I sent an email so hopefully they have some images to share. but even without that, it\xe2\x80\x99s great! thanks danayo
2018-02-28T21:45:13 <danayo> ok great sepidehshahi
2018-02-28T21:45:24 <danayo> thanks so much for your write-up, it was so helpful
2018-02-28T21:49:43 <sepidehshahi> np :)
2018-02-28T21:53:09 <sepidehshahi> danayo: for the warm up activity we had these four steps: build, title and description, artist statement, present to larger group. Do you think if we can remove the description, so make that a 2 minute step? or should we remove artist statement? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to open up some time to use it for co-designing the session in the beginning
2018-02-28T21:56:33 <danayo> sepidehshahi: good question, I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking back through our original plan
2018-02-28T21:58:14 <danayo> I see that we did plan all 4 steps - I can\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of me remember what we added at the last minute sepidehshahi
2018-02-28T21:58:21 <danayo> anyway, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter
2018-02-28T21:58:36 <danayo> the artist statements were so fun
2018-02-28T21:59:21 <danayo> I think we need to keep all steps sepidehshahi, but we can be more strict about the time for each
2018-02-28T21:59:24 <danayo> what do you think?
2018-02-28T21:59:41 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we added anything. I think we followed all the steps. the only difference was that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t go back to our original work and another group read our title and statement.
2018-02-28T22:00:11 <danayo> ok
2018-02-28T22:00:21 <sepidehshahi> agreed!
2018-02-28T22:00:36 <danayo> great
2018-02-28T22:02:22 <danayo> sepidehshahi: maybe instead of 3-4 sentences we should limit it to 1 or 2 (for teh artist statement)
2018-02-28T22:04:34 <sepidehshahi> we should also think about movement of the participant on wheelchair for this activity from station to station danayo
2018-02-28T22:07:15 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-02-28T22:07:59 <danayo> yes sepidehshahi, I think we just need to make sure that there is lots of room to maneuver a chair in generally, and that each station is accessible in terms of height and reach
2018-02-28T22:09:07 <sepidehshahi> for sure, we will try our best.

2018-02-28T16:05:43 <grrrero> hey jhung I got a question about flex
2018-02-28T16:05:47 <grrrero> If you have time :)
2018-02-28T16:06:00 <jhung> grrrero: sure
2018-02-28T16:06:29 <grrrero> I\'ve been trying to align some items to the bottom of a div using flex
2018-02-28T16:06:38 <grrrero> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/YPGIz2AK/
2018-02-28T16:07:01 <grrrero> The context is: the Floe logo and the floe-nav are on a row and in two columns
2018-02-28T16:07:39 <grrrero> floe-nav is floating at the top and I\'ve been trying to move it to the bottom so that it\'s the same height as the Floe tagline
2018-02-28T16:07:53 <grrrero> Am I missing something here or is there a better way to go about doing this?
2018-02-28T16:08:07 <jhung> grrrero: do you have an instance I can look at?
2018-02-28T16:09:14 <grrrero> The branch is here https://github.com/grrrero/floeproject.org/tree/FLOE-540
2018-02-28T16:09:52 <grrrero> And the page is resources.html
2018-02-28T16:09:53 <jhung> grrrero: ok I\'ll take a look.
2018-02-28T16:09:58 <grrrero> Thanks jhung

2018-02-28T16:16:39 <jhung> grrrero: I\'m in your room
2018-02-28T16:16:46 <grrrero> vidyo taking forever :(((
2018-02-28T16:16:53 <grrrero> Gimme a million years
2018-02-28T16:17:19 <jhung> I had the same problem with Caren_ yesterday
2018-02-28T16:22:37 <gmoss> alanharnum danayo michelled: I\'ve been thinking about whether blocks should have an indication on them about what kind of block they are. What are your thoughts on this? On one hand, it may help a user differentiate between the different blocks they\'ve added (especially if there are many), but I can also see a case for that being a bit too "busy" perhaps, at least visually
2018-02-28T16:23:11 <gmoss> of course I\'ll work from the latest design when it comes to the current effort, I just wanted to put my thoughts into writing :)
2018-02-28T16:24:39 <alanharnum> gmoss: I suppose it depends on how well the different elements indicate the kind of block
2018-02-28T16:24:50 <alanharnum> i can see how a small visual or text indicator might be useful
2018-02-28T16:26:34 <grrrero> jhung: IT WORKED :D
2018-02-28T16:26:39 <grrrero> jhung: THANK YOU :D

2018-02-28T16:31:39 <sepidehshahi> fluid-everyone - I\xe2\x80\x99m heading out to the office. I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the standup. Yesterday and this morning I worked on the mockups for BiT co-design workshop. I joined Jutta and others to discuss a co-design activity yesterday and worked on that last night. This morning I also received a change request from Matthias Re: D404.3. I edited the doc and sent back to him.
2018-02-28T16:45:21 <grrrero> michelled: I\'ve got my changes pushed if you want to check it out
2018-02-28T16:45:35 <grrrero> michelled: Also added navigation to main page and the news index page
2018-02-28T16:46:13 <michelled> grrrero: can you make a pull with it?
2018-02-28T16:46:17 <grrrero> Sure michelled
2018-02-28T16:47:21 <grrrero> michelled: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/64
2018-02-28T16:47:36 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2018-02-28T16:49:33 <michelled> grrrero: merged it - good catch on that broken link
2018-02-28T16:49:48 <grrrero> Yay!
2018-02-28T16:54:49 <michelled> grrrero: I wonder if we can make a styling tweak
2018-02-28T16:54:54 <grrrero> Sure
2018-02-28T16:55:00 <michelled> I realize that it\'s difficult to tell that the blurb goes with the link
2018-02-28T16:55:09 <michelled> they all seem on the same level, if you know what I mean
2018-02-28T16:55:14 <michelled> do you have thoughts about that?
2018-02-28T16:55:51 <grrrero> Yeah I agree -- would you lik to make them bigger?
2018-02-28T16:56:25 <grrrero> And add some more spacing
2018-02-28T16:56:26 <michelled> I\'m not sure - maybe it\'s just the spacing?
2018-02-28T16:56:40 <michelled> so the blurb should be closer to its link than to the next link
2018-02-28T16:56:44 <michelled> and maybe indented?
2018-02-28T16:56:46 <grrrero> Makes sense
2018-02-28T16:56:48 <grrrero> Okay sure
2018-02-28T16:57:03 <michelled> maybe play with it and see what you like, grrrero?
2018-02-28T16:57:05 <grrrero> Indent the blurb and indent the links ?
2018-02-28T16:57:07 <grrrero> Ok sure
2018-02-28T16:57:35 <michelled> when I said indent, I was talking about the blurb, since it comes after the link

2018-02-28T20:09:15 <JessM> danayo and Justin_o i was wondering if you two could interview another coop student tomorrow afternoon. if not we can schedule for Monday?
2018-02-28T20:10:23 <Justin_o> JessM, danayo: i\'m available for either
2018-02-28T20:21:14 <danayo> JessM: tomorrow would be better
2018-02-28T20:41:07 <danayo> sepidehshahi: what do you think of this tornado diagram? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/3kh0BJIF6xkhWzt
2018-02-28T20:43:26 <sepidehshahi> danayo: this is great!
2018-02-28T20:44:14 <sepidehshahi> the only thing that I\xe2\x80\x99d change would be #2 and #4 needs injections. They seem to be coming out of the tornado rather than going into it
2018-02-28T20:45:12 <sepidehshahi> so maybe just flip them horizontally
2018-02-28T20:46:40 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I flipped those actually so that they are always moving up the spiral
2018-02-28T20:47:13 <danayo> if you see what I mean
2018-02-28T20:47:40 <danayo> the way they were before they were actually pointing down the spiral
2018-02-28T20:47:46 <danayo> maybe I could put them all on one side
2018-02-28T20:47:50 <danayo> it woudl be clearer
2018-02-28T20:47:53 <grrrero> ping michelled I updated it
2018-02-28T20:48:00 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2018-02-28T20:48:18 <danayo> we need to show the upward movement somehow
2018-02-28T20:48:20 <michelled> thanks grrrero
2018-02-28T20:49:14 <sepidehshahi> you are right danayo. I think the way you have it is better than having all of them on one side

2018-02-28T21:21:38 <sepidehshahi> danayo: her students were using the map, so they might have taken photos. let me send an email to some of them to find out
