2018-03-14T15:20:43 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung, do you know if we have designed any diagram that is representative of Big IDeA?
2018-03-14T15:21:36 * grrrero joined the channel
2018-03-14T15:24:52 <jhung> sepidehshahi: are you referring to "BIG IDeA" as in JT\'s vision of it, or of the current project? I get confused as I currently see them as different things. Either way, I haven\'t seen a diagram.
2018-03-14T15:31:04 <sepidehshahi> yes, JT is referring to a diagram for BIG IDeA

2018-03-14T16:03:32 <jhung> I\'m going to start talking to him now alanharnum. I\'ll ping you if I need you?

2018-03-14T16:17:19 <jhung> alanharnum: just got off a call with David. I\'m going to try to schedule a meeting tomorrow to talk about BIG IDeA and Wheelmaps. What David has in mind is significantly different than what we\'ve been talking about so far. I\'m going to invite Michelled as well.
2018-03-14T16:18:05 <alanharnum> jhung ok - i\'ve got a meeting from 10:30 - 11:30 tomorrow with gtirloni_ and gmoss, but am otherwise free
