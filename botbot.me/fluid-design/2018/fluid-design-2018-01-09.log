2018-01-09T16:57:10 <gtirloni> alanharnum gmoss michelled colinclark: do you have some time this week to discuss next steps for SJRK-25 26 and 46?
2018-01-09T16:58:17 <colinclark> aka the "I feel that I should do something more from this JIRA but I\'m not sure what" issues :)
2018-01-09T16:58:35 <colinclark> definitely, gtirloni
2018-01-09T17:00:53 <gtirloni> :)
2018-01-09T17:02:31 <colinclark> and for the record, I\'m not sure there is hugely more needed on those JIRAs
2018-01-09T17:02:43 <colinclark> I think a lot of them were about surveying the landscape
2018-01-09T17:08:20 <gtirloni> ok. maybe we can meet tomorrow after standup? oh, i see michelle isn\'t here
2018-01-09T17:27:56 <colinclark> Thursday or Friday might be better for me, gtirloni
2018-01-09T17:28:24 <gtirloni> ok
