2018-06-05T15:31:13 <michelled> yes! 2 minutes :)
2018-06-05T15:31:56 <michelled> alanharnum, danayo, colinclark: I checked my notes, we are going to estimate a new grant possibility with BiT to create the infrastructure for simple art websites
2018-06-05T15:32:10 <michelled> it should be pretty cool and have some overlap with our plans for storytelling sites too
2018-06-05T15:32:20 <colinclark> ah yes
2018-06-05T15:32:22 <colinclark> great
2018-06-05T15:32:24 <michelled> alanharnum, danayo: when would you like to meet?
2018-06-05T15:32:54 <alanharnum> michelled: I could do sometime later this afternoon, or maybe tomorrow / Thursday
2018-06-05T15:33:14 <alanharnum> I need to spend some time with the co-op students discussing their community meeting tomorrow
2018-06-05T15:33:46 <danayo> michelled: sorry, are you refering to meeting about the SJRK retrospective? so many different meetings happening I lost track\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-06-05T15:34:10 <michelled> hahaha, no, I'm talking about the BiT tasking
2018-06-05T15:34:14 <danayo> ah!
2018-06-05T15:34:16 <michelled> maybe Thursday at 1:00?
2018-06-05T15:34:23 <michelled> alanharnum, danayo ^
2018-06-05T15:34:31 <alanharnum> michelled: that works for me

2018-06-05T15:38:21 <danayo> michelled, colinclark: what is the MyL3 meeting you\xe2\x80\x99re having today about? wondering if I should join you?
2018-06-05T15:39:23 <michelled> APCP dashboard + MyL3 planning meeting
2018-06-05T15:39:43 <michelled> it's going to be vague to start with the goal of having a concrete plan at the end
2018-06-05T15:39:52 <michelled> danayo, it would be useful to have you there if you have the time
2018-06-05T15:40:02 <danayo> sounds good michelled
2018-06-05T15:40:23 <michelled> ok, neuralmilkhotel, call me when you're ready :)
2018-06-05T15:53:48 <gmoss> alanharnum danayo michelled: when would be best to discuss the issues experienced with the storytelling tool in Colombia?
2018-06-05T15:58:59 <danayo> gmoss: wonder if it would make sense for michelled and I to check in first about Colombia. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t set a time to meet yet - does 3 work for you michelled ? then maybe we can meet with gmoss afterwards, or tomorrow some time?
2018-06-05T15:59:21 <michelled> yes, 3:00 works for me danayo
2018-06-05T15:59:36 <gmoss> danayo michelled: that sounds good to me! I'll be around :)
2018-06-05T15:59:51 <gmoss> I'll make a quick list in the meantime
2018-06-05T16:00:10 <michelled> thx gmoss

2018-06-05T16:16:09 <sepidehshahi> maybe we should contribute our Guide insights to this as well
2018-06-05T16:18:02 <danayo> interesting sepidehshahi

2018-06-05T19:56:23 <jhung> neuralmilkhotel: I took a look at your PR. It looks good. I can't test it fully in my local WP environment, so you'll probably want to do a check once in production. Also is screen reader testing being done?
2018-06-05T19:57:14 <jhung> Oh, and there's another PR too for SNOW-8. Do you want me to look at that one too?
2018-06-05T19:57:59 <jhung> ^ looks like SNOW-8 is included in the SNOW-19 PR as well?
2018-06-05T20:05:08 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-06-05T20:16:52 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: Sorry just saw this now -- yes 8 is in 19
2018-06-05T20:17:22 <jhung> ok awesome. I will merge and close both PRs neuralmilkhotel
2018-06-05T20:18:10 <jhung> neuralmilkhotel: actually, it's in your own repo. You can merge it yourself. I don't have access. :)
2018-06-05T20:18:38 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok thanks so much jhung
2018-06-05T20:19:33 * alanharnum has quit
2018-06-05T20:21:28 <neuralmilkhotel> Hi fluid-everyone I've got a working version of the new Inclusive Cities site https://rawgit.com/grrrero/website-cities/CITY-12/index.html
2018-06-05T20:21:38 <neuralmilkhotel> https://rawgit.com/grrrero/website-cities/CITY-12/ideas/for-an-inclusive-quayside/index.html
2018-06-05T20:21:50 <neuralmilkhotel> https://rawgit.com/grrrero/website-cities/CITY-12/ideas/co-design-draft-proposal/index.html -- Might need to resize the image at the bottom
2018-06-05T20:27:03 <jhung> That image at the bottom could be done as an SVG. Would look much nicer\xe2\x80\xa6 or maybe as a vertical graphic so it scales better on mobile neuralmilkhotel?
2018-06-05T20:30:56 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: sepidehshahi is giving me svg versions -- as for making them vertical, that might be a lot of work? :(
2018-06-05T20:36:59 <jhung> neuralmilkhotel: maybe something to improve upon at a later time (re: vertical graphic). We could even use a media query to change the graphic versions from horizontal to vertical\xe2\x80\xa6 now I'm just getting ahead of myself. lol
2018-06-05T20:40:53 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: Ahhh good idea
2018-06-05T20:41:09 <neuralmilkhotel> Changed it into an svg now... feel free to try to break it again :) jhung
2018-06-05T20:46:06 <jhung> haha will do.
