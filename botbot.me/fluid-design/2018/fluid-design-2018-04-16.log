2018-04-16T15:08:56 <sepidehshahi> Hi simonjb and lliskovoi: I have read through Bianca\xe2\x80\x99s list of questions and based on her concerns I have tried to create a short list of questions for our concerns regarding this collaboration. Please feel free to modify the list and add your concerns, questions

2018-04-16T17:24:20 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi, do you have or do you know if there were any notes from the recent ILDH crit?
2018-04-16T17:26:09 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I took some notes and I have tried to address most comments in the latest update, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any notes on the wiki
2018-04-16T17:26:55 <sepidehshahi> I can email you my notes if that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful danayo?
2018-04-16T17:28:01 <danayo> can you post them on the wiki sepidehshahi?
2018-04-16T17:28:11 <sepidehshahi> sure,
2018-04-16T17:29:39 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: can I create a meeting note page for a past design crit?
2018-04-16T17:30:01 <danayo> we\xe2\x80\x99ve been posting notes here sepidehshahi https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=79560733
2018-04-16T17:31:26 <sepidehshahi> yes, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let me create a new page, or maybe I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it...
2018-04-16T17:32:18 <sepidehshahi> I just found it danayo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll add my note now
2018-04-16T17:32:29 <danayo> great, thanks!
2018-04-16T17:49:38 <sepidehshahi> danayo: here is what I had written during the crit: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/ILDH+Restructuring+Meeting+Notes
2018-04-16T17:52:34 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi. Partly I was trying to remember if/what we had discussed about having site-wide navigation in the side bar, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything here
2018-04-16T17:53:49 <sepidehshahi> no danayo, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss that. That was part of the original site structure
2018-04-16T17:54:46 <sepidehshahi> and it just carried on to this new one. I agree with your pont and think maybe it not very useful to have it on the introduction and home page since they are only one page and have no other links
2018-04-16T17:55:11 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-04-16T17:57:12 <danayo> sepidehshahi: it sounded like jhung was thinking to have site-wide navigation show up in the sidebar, which is another approach - maybe we can just check in with him and discuss when he\xe2\x80\x99s back
2018-04-16T17:57:34 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo
2018-04-16T17:58:33 <sepidehshahi> Hi grrrero: do you have some time after 3:00 to talk about the site?
2018-04-16T17:59:00 <grrrero> Yep sepidehshahi !
2018-04-16T17:59:32 <sepidehshahi> great! is 3:30 ok for you?
2018-04-16T17:59:45 <sepidehshahi> grrrero: ^
2018-04-16T17:59:46 <grrrero> Yup :)

2018-04-16T18:03:33 <danayo> michelled: I want to commit the latest floe news item to the repo - I think I just need to clone the fluidproject.org repo first, right?
2018-04-16T18:05:09 <michelled> danayo: you mean https://floeproject.org/ right?
2018-04-16T18:05:32 <danayo> I mean this michelled https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org
2018-04-16T18:06:55 <michelled> yes, that looks right danayo. it looks like Jon put some info about creating a Floe News item here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Project+Infrastructure

2018-04-16T18:08:47 <danayo> I dont\xe2\x80\x99 see anything specific to adding news items there michelled, am I missing something?
2018-04-16T18:09:56 <danayo> there is a template in the repo (that I created :) so I know what to do once I have the files locally, I just need some help recalling the steps in git
2018-04-16T18:10:30 <michelled> ah cool. from the 'update procedures' column in the floe project website row: Adding News items:
