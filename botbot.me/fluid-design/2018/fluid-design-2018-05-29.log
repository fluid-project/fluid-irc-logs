2018-05-29T13:40:46 <avtar1> neuralmilkhotel: ah i thought we were gonna use the original resolution for the header on the page
2018-05-29T13:41:11 <neuralmilkhotel> You mean 1380px?
2018-05-29T13:41:16 <avtar1> yup
2018-05-29T13:41:17 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar1: ^
2018-05-29T13:41:30 <neuralmilkhotel> I did a min-height of 650px
2018-05-29T13:42:47 <neuralmilkhotel> It's ~1380px in my screen

2018-05-29T13:46:38 <avtar1> neuralmilkhotel: i can send a 1280px size but what to do you think?
2018-05-29T13:46:43 <avtar1> sepidehshahi: ^
2018-05-29T13:47:06 <avtar1> it looked fine at 1am but right now it's looking pretty bottom heavy with the blue shape

2018-05-29T13:48:14 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar1: The edges are a bit abruptly cut off at the sides; even though it's displaying in full width of the original image
2018-05-29T13:49:31 <sepidehshahi> if you can just increase the width of your canvas without changing any other thing that should solve the issue with the cutt of drop shadows

2018-05-29T13:50:23 <sepidehshahi> and yes I agree the lake is overpowering the other elements on the page. if you can reduce the height of the lake to half, it should solve the problem avtar1
