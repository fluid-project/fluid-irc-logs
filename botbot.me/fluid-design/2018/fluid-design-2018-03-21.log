2018-03-21T14:21:20 <grrrero> Hi jhung, did I read your email right, we just need to enable the parent theme and check that there are no Big IDeA styles/content left?
2018-03-21T14:32:38 <jhung> grrrero: that's a visual test to verify stuff has been refactored. A stroll through the files should be done too.
2018-03-21T14:32:58 <jhung> I already looked through the files once and I didn't see anything - but it's good to check.
2018-03-21T14:34:58 <grrrero> jhung: Ok!

2018-03-21T14:43:45 <jeevan_> sepidehshahi: I have a query regarding myL3 project
2018-03-21T14:44:20 <sepidehshahi> Hi jeevan_ how can I help you?
2018-03-21T14:45:15 <jeevan_> regarding GSoC Task is just to import the data. Do I have to add more features using weather and location details into MyL3.
2018-03-21T14:46:47 <jhung> grrrero: yes there's a JIRA for that FLOE-538. I imagine that will be done once the refactor is complete as the parent theme will change a bit and we'll need to update that pull request.

2018-03-21T14:47:46 <jeevan_> sepidehshahi: where can I get more details about 'Personal Health App'
2018-03-21T14:49:31 <sepidehshahi> jeevan_: the importaed data would be used and displayed in different places and in different styles in MyL3. Se with this project we are hoping to achieve not only an import of the data, but also various representation of the data in a style that matches MyL3 design. For example, the weather data may apear as text in one part of MyL3 and in another part it may appear in a chart, and in another place it may be displayed just with
2018-03-21T14:49:32 <sepidehshahi> an icon

2018-03-21T14:55:33 <jeevan_> sepidehshahi: where can I get more details about 'Personal Health App'
2018-03-21T15:04:57 <sepidehshahi> jeevan_: that could be any application that collects an individual\xe2\x80\x99s health data. We did not specify an app as we were not sure which ones are available and accessible by GSoC students. So, you can use any application that is more common in your region.some examples are Meal Pal, My fitness Pal, Strava, Nike training club, Insight timer, etc.

2018-03-21T18:03:13 <Justin_o> jhung: have you ever styled a <mark> element?
2018-03-21T18:04:47 <Justin_o> perhaps it's just something with my styles, because it seems to be working in a jsfiddle

2018-03-21T18:11:27 <Justin_o> jhung: it was my fault, I have it setup that my css file is being pulled in a stylus file and i hadn't been regenerating the file :(
2018-03-21T18:12:02 <jhung> Justin_o: haha ok. Hope it didn't take you long to figure that one out.
2018-03-21T18:13:10 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: and jhung do you know where the Create-a-thon content will be published? in the ILDH or the guide, or both?
2018-03-21T18:14:16 <jhung> sepidehshahi: good question! It's a bit long for the Guide, but maybe it it were split up into an Activity and Practice?
2018-03-21T18:14:29 <jhung> Otherwise it can go right into the ILDH.
2018-03-21T18:15:05 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks jhung
2018-03-21T18:18:54 <jhung> For what it's worth sepidehshahi, both Caren_ and I always thought it was going into the ILDH. Perhaps we can have a Create-a-Thon activity in the Guide, and have it reference a more detailed article on the ILDH?

2018-03-21T18:26:14 <sepidehshahi> I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to include it in both the Guide and ILDH jhung. It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of similar to the inclusive hacking and making entry by Alan
