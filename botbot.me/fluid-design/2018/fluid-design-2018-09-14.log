2018-09-14T15:19:21 <simonjb> fluid-everyone: I'm going to skip standup today -- I'm working on posting info to the Inclusive Cities site for the upcoming Hackathon
2018-09-14T15:19:48 <michelled> simonjb: I'm noticing an issue on the cities site regarding some images not showing up
2018-09-14T15:19:56 <michelled> for example on this page: https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/ideas/students-results/
2018-09-14T15:20:18 <simonjb> michelled: I'm guessing you need to make your browser windows wider?
2018-09-14T15:20:36 <michelled> oh! that again!
2018-09-14T15:20:39 <michelled> sigh :)
2018-09-14T15:20:40 <michelled> thx
2018-09-14T15:20:53 <simonjb> michelled: if you had some time, it would be great to file a bug
2018-09-14T15:21:09 <simonjb> michelled: it's definitely a problem in our styling implementation
2018-09-14T15:21:36 <michelled> ok, I will
2018-09-14T15:22:04 <simonjb> michelled: I filed https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/CITY-16 which avtar made a fix for (not yet merged)
2018-09-14T15:22:15 <simonjb> but this is a different issue
2018-09-14T15:22:51 <simonjb> we have a rule that only uses 70% (if my memory is correct) of the window
2018-09-14T15:23:42 <simonjb> so to see the images, your window has to be 1/0.7 the width of the width at which we hide them
2018-09-14T15:23:59 <simonjb> (I think, I looked into it briefly)
2018-09-14T15:24:08 <simonjb> but it's something that we need to fix
