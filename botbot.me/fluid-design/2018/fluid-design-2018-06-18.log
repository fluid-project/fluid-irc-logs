2018-06-18T16:02:40 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: sounds good, call me when you are ready
2018-06-18T16:04:08 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: I tried calling you but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through
2018-06-18T16:05:35 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: weird -- I didn't get notification from Skype. I launched Skype explicitly and I do see the call with Jeevan but I can't connect
2018-06-18T16:06:03 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: do you want to start the call?

2018-06-18T16:40:46 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I merged your pull request for the privacy ILDH entry.
2018-06-18T16:41:02 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks jhung
2018-06-18T16:41:21 <danayo> thanks jhung!
2018-06-18T16:42:19 <jhung> no prob.
2018-06-18T16:45:22 <sepidehshahi> jhung: should I do anything else in order to see the entery in the ILDH in the approaches section?
2018-06-18T16:46:25 <jhung> sepidehshahi: it may take a couple minutes for the changes to show up.
2018-06-18T16:46:34 <jhung> I don't see the changes yet either.
2018-06-18T16:46:43 <sepidehshahi> sure
2018-06-18T16:46:52 <danayo> sepidehshahi: sorry I missed the MyL3 meeting
2018-06-18T16:47:36 <sepidehshahi> no worries danayo, today we are fousing on the Infusion framework and more technical aspects and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss anything related to design
2018-06-18T16:47:48 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi, thanks
2018-06-18T16:47:53 <sepidehshahi> np

2018-06-18T18:21:27 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99m still not able to see the privacy entery
2018-06-18T18:26:00 <jhung> sepidehshahi - I took a look, there seems to have been a problem with the web hook. gtirloni the last delivery didn't work - 302 invalid HTTP. https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/settings/hooks/12474094
2018-06-18T18:26:32 <danayo> jhung: yes!
2018-06-18T18:26:37 <danayo> to the crit
2018-06-18T18:27:00 <jhung> Awesome. Glad you said yes because the emails went out already. :)
2018-06-18T18:28:59 <gtirloni> jhung: i'm checking, thanks for the heads up

2018-06-18T18:44:45 <gtirloni> jhung: jenkins is configured to push all files from the gh-pages branch to the server. the last commit to 'gh-pages' was on Apr 23.. this is why commits are not triggering jobs
2018-06-18T18:46:13 <jhung> gtirloni: ah. I thought our strategy was to no longer maintain those gh-pages branches and to have jenkins handle the build?
2018-06-18T18:47:00 <gtirloni> i think that was the strategy moving forward yes
2018-06-18T18:47:56 <jhung> gtirloni: ok. What can I do to help fix this? We probably want to get rid of the gh-pages branch.
2018-06-18T18:48:43 <gtirloni> let me give it a shot at converting it to build and push, i'll create a jira for the handbook
2018-06-18T18:49:08 <jhung> ok thanks gtirloni!
2018-06-18T18:50:34 <gtirloni> np :)
