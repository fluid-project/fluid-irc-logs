2018-08-09T15:10:15 <gmoss> jhung: it\'s great! I like the bright tones that increase with the brightness of the light
2018-08-09T15:13:40 <jhung> gmoss: yeah. A lot of time was spent getting the sound right. It feels much better than the earlier version I shared a while ago.

2018-08-09T15:15:53 <jhung> Right now there\'s a design issue with the magnet move clicking sound. We\'re wondering if the clicking sounds are confusing and could be misinterpreted.

2018-08-09T18:05:46 <jhung> danayo and sepidehshahi: are we using the term "learning preferences", or "learning style" when describing the different ways individuals learn?
2018-08-09T18:06:34 <sepidehshahi> jhung: I think I have used \xe2\x80\x9clearning preferences\xe2\x80\x9d I think
2018-08-09T18:06:50 <danayo> jhung: I think Caren was suggesting we avoid \xe2\x80\x9clearning styles\xe2\x80\x9d
2018-08-09T18:09:36 <jhung> sepidehshahi and danayo: thanks for clarifying. Just double-checking. :)
2018-08-09T18:09:43 <jhung> "Learning Style" sounds static, whereas "Learning preferences" is related to context.
