2018-03-01T15:27:56 <carenwatkins> morning jhung if you have a moment could we touch base about text alets (moment to moment) using the keyboard interaction. Can be found at the bottom of this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ttScCDi2QGAEvmdYKiLMuKIhzBA1N9mJb_VImG7eBrs/edit#heading=h.rh6pwmm9ddsc

2018-03-01T15:55:44 <jhung> carenwatkins: I made some comments. We can talk it over?
2018-03-01T15:58:12 * danayo joined the channel
2018-03-01T15:58:46 <carenwatkins> for sure. skype?
2018-03-01T15:59:57 <jhung> Vidyo still not working for you carenwatkins?
2018-03-01T16:00:18 <carenwatkins> not on my laptop :-(

2018-03-01T16:42:29 <carenwatkins> sepidehshahi: danayo is there a schedule and info for the co-design session on Monday?
2018-03-01T16:44:21 <danayo> carenwatkins: we\xe2\x80\x99re putting together schedule and handouts etc - we\xe2\x80\x99ll post them here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Bodies+in+Translation
2018-03-01T16:44:28 <danayo> and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find info about the last one there too
2018-03-01T16:44:44 <danayo> it will be somewhat similar, but design activities will have different focus
2018-03-01T16:44:57 <danayo> tryign to get more concrete this time
2018-03-01T16:45:30 <danayo> actually it\xe2\x80\x99s a good reminder to update the wiki page with details :)

2018-03-01T16:55:13 <sepidehshahi> carenwatkins: it will be from 10 to 2:30
2018-03-01T16:57:17 <carenwatkins> danayo: is there a link to the \xe2\x80\x9ctornado\xe2\x80\x9d and descriptions. I think it was mentioned that it got posted on the Design Guide, but I may be mistaken. I\xe2\x80\x99m curious because it might be helpful to the work being done on the Platform Co-op :-)
2018-03-01T16:57:26 <carenwatkins> thanks sepidehshahi !
2018-03-01T16:57:51 <sepidehshahi> yw
2018-03-01T16:59:47 <danayo> carenwatkins: it\xe2\x80\x99s up in the guide now, at the bottom of this page https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/VirtuousTornado.html
2018-03-01T16:59:53 <danayo> it definitely needs some work still
2018-03-01T16:59:58 <danayo> but we needed to get something up
2018-03-01T17:01:20 <danayo> carenwatkins: jutta had mentioned wanting to indicate that the yellow \xe2\x80\x9cstuff\xe2\x80\x9d gets swept up and into the tornado and becomes a part of it - so I used colour to indicate this, but I want to change it so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on colour alone
2018-03-01T17:03:41 <danayo> among other things
2018-03-01T17:06:18 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I have shared a google doc with you for the co-design activities

2018-03-01T17:08:47 <carenwatkins> it\xe2\x80\x99s so great to get this documented in the Design Guide! danayo sepidehshahi
2018-03-01T17:09:21 <sepidehshahi> yes carenwatkins!
2018-03-01T17:10:53 <carenwatkins> wondering if I\xe2\x80\x99m reading figure 4 description incorrectly\xe2\x80\xa6should the first \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d?
2018-03-01T17:11:32 <carenwatkins> danayo: sepidehshahi ^
2018-03-01T17:13:20 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right carenwatkins
2018-03-01T17:13:58 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if alanharnum or danayo can fix this in Github ^
2018-03-01T17:15:09 <alanharnum> I can fix it quick, I think it should be "an upward spiral"
2018-03-01T17:18:45 * lliskovoi has quit
2018-03-01T17:19:40 <sepidehshahi> thanks alanharnum
2018-03-01T17:24:11 <danayo> thanks carenwatkins, alanharnum
2018-03-01T17:24:44 <danayo> thanks for the google doc sepidehshahi
2018-03-01T17:25:06 <danayo> just looking through it - have to step away for 1/2 hour but want to meet when I\xe2\x80\x99m back?
2018-03-01T17:25:15 <sepidehshahi> it still needs lots of work
2018-03-01T17:25:24 <sepidehshahi> sounds good danayo
2018-03-01T17:25:29 <danayo> great

2018-03-01T18:23:23 <sepidehshahi> what?
2018-03-01T18:23:25 <danayo> we modified our artwork to fit the artist statement
2018-03-01T18:23:43 <sepidehshahi> YES!!! good memory danayo
2018-03-01T18:24:05 <danayo> but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should do that this time, in the interest of time
2018-03-01T18:24:08 <danayo> sepidehshahi
2018-03-01T18:24:38 <sepidehshahi> I agree, we are really short on time, and I think there is more to do this time

2018-03-01T19:30:07 <jhung> simonjb: sure. I have time. Is it available somewhere for me to look at?
2018-03-01T19:30:58 <simonjb> no, I\'d need to share my screen I think
2018-03-01T19:31:27 <simonjb> you could run it locally (a node process)
2018-03-01T19:32:16 <simonjb> jhung: might be easiest to do a vidyo screenshare, at least initially
2018-03-01T19:39:47 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-03-01T19:40:25 <jhung> simonjb: ok. Call me on Vidyo when ready
2018-03-01T19:40:40 <simonjb> jhung: awesome, thanks, will do
2018-03-01T19:51:26 <sepidehshahi> carenwatkins: in our Monday co-design session, we are asking participants to map out a digital platform. So, we wanted to show them some examples of system maps to help them do this activity. we were wondering if you have created any digital system mapping that we could use as an example

2018-03-01T21:00:15 <carenwatkins> sepidehshahi: sorry missed your note from earlier. Not sure if this qualifies for what you\xe2\x80\x99re needing. It has some mindmapping followed by some platfrom mapping (then paper prototyping): https://www.dropbox.com/s/pxcdhv8g5xmqb7z/APP%20prototype%20presentation_CW_2015.pdf?dl=0
2018-03-01T21:31:13 <carenwatkins> hi jhung: do you think past tense should be used when writting compiled descriptions intended to be activated after an action?
2018-03-01T21:37:46 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot carenwatkins! these are really cool
2018-03-01T21:38:31 <danayo> thanks carenwatkins - would you be ok if we shared this with co-design participants for BiT?
2018-03-01T21:39:54 <carenwatkins> danayo: for sure. is it hi-res enough for your needs?
2018-03-01T21:40:09 <danayo> actually that photo is not high res enough to zoom in on
2018-03-01T21:40:29 <danayo> do you have a higher res version carenwatkins ?
2018-03-01T21:40:51 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99ll make one for you and send the link, danayo

2018-03-01T21:50:33 <carenwatkins> danayo: your welcome. do you need a written transcript of the content? I don\xe2\x80\x99t have one (sorry), but thought about it as I was reviewing the content that is handwritten.

2018-03-01T21:51:05 <danayo> that\xe2\x80\x99s ok carenwatkins - for our purposes, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll use it as a quick reference of what is possible, but not get into much detail
2018-03-01T21:51:22 <carenwatkins> ok, great
