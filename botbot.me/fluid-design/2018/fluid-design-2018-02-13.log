2018-02-13T15:50:35 <michelled> talk about excellent overlap!
2018-02-13T15:51:09 <michelled> she is a friend of Justin_o\'s who is currently doing a UX program at UofT
2018-02-13T15:53:43 <grrrero> michelled and Justin_o: Is this Christine from curling? :D
2018-02-13T15:54:15 <michelled> it\'s Christine\'s sister
2018-02-13T15:54:19 <grrrero> Ahhh!

2018-02-13T20:01:37 <gmoss> ping alanharnum
2018-02-13T20:01:47 <alanharnum> gmoss: pong
2018-02-13T20:02:26 <gmoss> alanharnum: are you available and comfortable with chatting with michelled and I over the interwebs, in the immediate future, verbally?
2018-02-13T20:03:29 <gmoss> the aim being to coordinate our efforts and make sure we\'re not working on things that will clobber each other :]
2018-02-13T20:05:34 <alanharnum> gmoss michelled: sure, let me just finish something up here - 3:15?
2018-02-13T20:06:02 <gmoss> alanharnum: sounds good! Just call me on Vidyo directly when you\'re ready :) we\'re both at this computer

2018-02-13T20:44:20 <gmoss> hi danayo danayo_ :) alanharnum, michelled and I were chatting last week about the text block, and we had an idea. In a similar vein to the image block having alt-text and a description, we though that perhaps the text block might benefit from having something like a "simplified" text, or a summary or description. Do you have any thoughts on this?
2018-02-13T20:48:43 <danayo_> gmoss: I like the idea of being able to provide simplified text. perhaps not as a "required" entry though (guess we\'ll need to decide what the bare minimum requirements we want to set for "alternative" content is).
2018-02-13T20:48:45 <danayo_> The idea of providing headings also came up at the crit - I like the idea of a descriptive heading or a kind of section heading for each block too
2018-02-13T20:48:59 <danayo_> I guess this could either be a header or a simple description
2018-02-13T20:49:02 <danayo_> description/summary
2018-02-13T20:49:09 <danayo_> I worry about making it too cumbersome tho
2018-02-13T20:49:46 <danayo_> alanharnum, michelled ^
2018-02-13T20:50:19 <danayo_> having to write a summary for each text block seems like a lot
2018-02-13T20:50:32 <gmoss> danayo_: indeed, it might clutter up the interface a little if we had one for each block, though I can also see the value of it. Lisa mentioned that perhaps we could have the ability to set a header for each block, and perhaps also the level of that header (1 through 6 corresponding to h1, h2, ...)
2018-02-13T20:50:55 <alanharnum> danayo_: turning headings on or off could be a scaffolding feature, something to make it easier for people to navigate
2018-02-13T20:50:56 <gmoss> a summary does seem like a lot to write for each block, I agree
2018-02-13T20:51:09 <alanharnum> I think a summary is a good option, but shouldn\'t be required
2018-02-13T20:51:34 <danayo_> yeah that\'s what I was refering to about headers gmoss - but each text block may not necessarily be a separate "section" requiring a header
2018-02-13T20:51:45 <gmoss> At the very least, in our implementation, each block could have a header in the template to help with navigation with keyboards or screen readers
2018-02-13T20:52:38 <danayo_> gmoss: I agree. I guess in this first impl each header would be at the same level?
2018-02-13T20:53:03 <gmoss> danayo_: yes, that\'s correct. all h2\'s, for instance, as michelled has just suggested
2018-02-13T20:53:06 <danayo_> so they\'re not really "headers" in the strict sense, but more of a description
2018-02-13T20:55:11 <danayo_> alanharnum: +1 to turning headers on/off
2018-02-13T20:56:16 <danayo_> or I guess they are some kind of descriptive header!
2018-02-13T20:56:19 <danayo_> :)
