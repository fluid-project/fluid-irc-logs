2018-07-04T15:09:25 <danayo> I like that inclusive components resource avtar, thanks
2018-07-04T15:11:30 <carenwatkins_> I'll be missing standup today. On my way to the IDRC after a noon appointment. UPDATE: snow is progressing. Le rabbit hole is the editing of content for language and structure that is more inclusive. I'm doing my best to change or bridge deficit-based language and edit some of the pieces toward simple language. I'm also keeping a copy of tracked changes in secondary folders so we don't loose the origin
2018-07-04T15:11:30 <carenwatkins_> copy--just in case! Also trying to build community and followers on Twitter (and FB) for SNOW and wondered if the IDRC twitter account might want to consider retweeting some relevant pieces from the SNOW account. :-)

2018-07-04T16:00:45 <sepidehshahi> Hi Hassany2, do you have a few minutes to chat?
2018-07-04T16:04:12 <danayo> lliskovoi: do you have some time today to work on that SJRK map? Hopefully we just need to add a bit more info (which I can email to you)
2018-07-04T16:05:35 <lliskovoi> Hi danayo, yep, I have a bit of time today, if you can send the info, I'll make changes to the map
2018-07-04T16:07:23 <danayo> great thanks lliskovoi

2018-07-04T16:32:14 <sepidehshahi> danayo: unfortunately I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to create an interactive access guide after all. I have put the content together in a google slide. So, any one can make copy of the guide and make changes based on their co-design session.
