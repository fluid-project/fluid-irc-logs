2018-01-12T14:15:07 <sepidehshahi> Hi Justin_o, do you know if there is a file that contains all the UIO adjusters\xe2\x80\x99 icons?

2018-01-12T14:26:15 <carenwatkins> lliskovoi: hey there. last night I went to Costco to purchase a base flip phone and asked about phones without data packages\xe2\x80\xa6there is only one highend samsung at 500$.
2018-01-12T14:29:56 <carenwatkins> I got an interesting anecdote about one of his customers. A woman was looking for a phone with a keypad that was based on different colours and not numerals because her husband couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize (or recall sequences of) numbers but could recognize sequencing of colour.
2018-01-12T14:30:16 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: you mean existing ones?
2018-01-12T14:30:57 <sepidehshahi> yes Justin_o
2018-01-12T14:31:18 <sepidehshahi> and could you also tell me the size of icons that you need?
2018-01-12T14:31:24 <carenwatkins> or recall sequencing of colour rather than sequencing of numbers. lliskovoi ^
2018-01-12T14:31:25 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i guess the closest thing would be this font https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/src/framework/preferences/fonts
2018-01-12T14:32:10 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: you may want to look at this doc that eloisa made https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Standard+workflow+in+maintaining+and+creating+icon+fonts
2018-01-12T14:32:46 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: she created a repo to house all of our icons that we could programmatically generate a font from https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons
2018-01-12T14:33:29 <sepidehshahi> This is great Justin_o! I was almost creating a similar thing since I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find all icons in one place. thanks
2018-01-12T14:34:40 <Justin_o> :) I\'m working on incorporating that into infusion and replacing the existing font files with ones we\'ll create using a build process.
2018-01-12T14:42:19 <jhung> gtirloni: is it possible to set up an email under the bigidea.one domain?
2018-01-12T14:42:44 <gtirloni> jhung: yes, but redirects only
2018-01-12T14:43:57 <jhung> gtirloni: that should be fine. Is it possible to set up a contact@bigidea.one and have it direct to me (for now). Later it will be changed to direct to David Pereya.
2018-01-12T14:44:15 <gtirloni> jhung: ok, will do. i will email you when it\'s done
2018-01-12T14:44:23 <jhung> Awesome. Thanks gtirloni!
2018-01-12T14:44:29 <gtirloni> np!

2018-01-12T14:45:14 <simonjb> hi sepidehshahi, I\'m working on updating the Visible Nexus UI today and I was wondering what the best way would be for me to get colours from your design PDF?
2018-01-12T14:46:06 <simonjb> the PDF viewer that I\'m using doesn\'t have a functionality to view colours (I think)
2018-01-12T14:46:25 <sepidehshahi> hi simonjb, I can send you the hex values
2018-01-12T14:46:46 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: ok, that would be great! thanks
2018-01-12T14:46:50 <sepidehshahi> or RGB values, which ever that works better for you simonjb
2018-01-12T14:47:04 <simonjb> either is fine
2018-01-12T14:47:21 <simonjb> hex is good
2018-01-12T14:47:28 <sepidehshahi> sure, just could you let me know which file you are using?
2018-01-12T14:48:51 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: ^
2018-01-12T14:48:53 <simonjb> I\'m working off VisibleNexusUI_Exploration_V5_SS.pdf -- the one that I attached to this JIRA issue https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2811
2018-01-12T14:49:16 <sepidehshahi> great, thanks
2018-01-12T14:51:12 <gtirloni> jhung: you should receive an email to verify your address in a few seconds
2018-01-12T14:52:58 <jhung> gtirloni: thanks for the heads up. I was about to trash it. :)
2018-01-12T14:54:46 <gtirloni> jhung: poor spam, no love :P
2018-01-12T14:57:38 <jhung> gtirloni: got your email.
2018-01-12T14:57:47 <gtirloni> cool, so it\'s done

2018-01-12T18:26:25 <michelled> alanharnum, gmoss: thought you\'d find this interesting: https://storymap.knightlab.com/
2018-01-12T18:26:38 <michelled> here\'s an example of it in use: https://ifex.org/international/2018/01/09/artistic-rebellion/
2018-01-12T18:27:38 <alanharnum> michelled: neat - Knight Lab does really interesting work, they make Timeline.js as well (which we used in that meeting talking about ATRC/IDRC history)
2018-01-12T18:28:10 <michelled> ah, right, I thought they sounded familiar!
2018-01-12T18:28:27 <gmoss> michelled: very cool! reminds me of a digital version of the physical audio-recording map that Pilar brought along the coast in Colombia
2018-01-12T18:29:24 <gmoss> also, when I was talking about having audio integrated in the tool within a block of text, I had imagined exactly this: http://soundcite.knightlab.com/
