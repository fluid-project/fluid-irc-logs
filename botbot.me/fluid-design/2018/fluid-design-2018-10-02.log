2018-10-02T15:27:06 <jhung> avtar: I might have a DEEP video for you for PhET.
2018-10-02T15:32:17 <avtar> jhung: is it posted somewhere?

2018-10-02T15:55:47 <jhung> Not yet avtar. I have two raw videos and I need to gather a few more images. Should I record and edit together my portion and you\'ll put it together with the rest? What kind of finished state is best for you?
2018-10-02T15:56:31 <avtar> jhung: i think we\'ll have a better idea of that later this week but "Should I record and edit together my portion" is a safe bet :)

2018-10-02T16:00:08 <jhung> Probably at home avtar.
2018-10-02T16:00:33 <avtar> ok cool
2018-10-02T16:03:05 <avtar> jhung: any idea when you\'ll be recording? i\'m going to go through existing videos today so i should have a more useful answer (in terms of finished state, preferred resolution) by tomorrow morning

2018-10-02T19:46:52 <gmoss> Justin_o: the Presentation Translation works well enough. I ran through an old presentation I\'d made a few years ago about HTML best practices and it correctly transcribed about 90% of it. It had a delay of a second or two before it provided subtitles, and it\'s fairly configurable. I didn\'t try speaking to it in French and seeing if it translated to English accurately (or vice versa) but maybe when you\'re feeling better we
2018-10-02T19:46:52 <gmoss> can give it a go
2018-10-02T19:49:01 <gmoss> I also didn\'t try running it without an internet connection

2018-10-02T22:39:10 <carenwatkins_> Hi danayo I\'m online if you wanted to talk co-op graphic. I was looking for the last graphic I contributed to and found the hexagon graphic on the same page... https://platform.coop/stories/the-platform-co-op-development-kit Wonder if that gives insight into how it will be used?
