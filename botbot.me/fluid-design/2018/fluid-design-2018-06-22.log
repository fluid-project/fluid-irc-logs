2018-06-22T15:23:56 <sepidehshahi> Hi clown, what was the name of the program you were suggesting for creating interactive forms?
2018-06-22T15:24:25 <sepidehshahi> I think Dana mentioned that is not keyboard accessible
2018-06-22T15:24:38 <clown> hi sepidehshahi \xe2\x80\x94 it was  joke, and it\'s not a program.  It\'s a toolkit called "dojo"
2018-06-22T15:24:56 <sepidehshahi> cool, thanks clown
2018-06-22T15:25:32 <clown> re:  not keyboard accessible \xe2\x80\x94 I spend the good part of six months making it keyboard accessible.  Mind you, that was back in 2009 - 2010.
2018-06-22T15:26:43 <clown> but, alanharnum had a good point:  is dojo still around even?
2018-06-22T15:27:25 <alanharnum> clown: definitely looks like it is: https://dojotoolkit.org/
2018-06-22T15:27:30 <clown> well, if you want to look further, here an url:  https://dojotoolkit.org/
2018-06-22T15:27:41 <clown> alanharnum:  like ships passing in the night\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-06-22T15:27:48 <sepidehshahi> :D if you have made it keyboard accessible so it should be accessible then. thanks for the links, let me have a look

2018-06-22T15:28:23 <clown> that\'s one weird docker image, alanharnum
2018-06-22T15:28:56 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: when you say "interactive forms", what features were you particularly looking for?
2018-06-22T15:29:17 <clown> to be complete, simonjb and david bolter started the work on making dojo keyboard accessible.  I came in later on.
2018-06-22T15:29:31 <sepidehshahi> ^ these are amazing alanharnum
2018-06-22T15:29:48 <alanharnum> I can\'t claim credit, just copied and pasted from an ASCII art site :p
2018-06-22T15:30:20 <sepidehshahi> ;) Basically I want to create a template that anyone can just darg images and type simple text to build an access guide

2018-06-22T15:51:06 <clown> sepidehshahi:  To back off a bit: when you said you were creating interactive forms and were concerned that they might not be accessible, I suggested using html and making web pages.  I thought you were using pdf, but I might have misunderstood.
2018-06-22T15:51:28 <clown> then, as a joke, I said "use dojo" for more complex user inteface widgets.
2018-06-22T15:51:43 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-06-22T15:52:29 <clown> but I don\'t really understand the nature of your problem \xe2\x80\x94 how complicated it is is, nor how much coding would be needed.

2018-06-22T17:06:06 <sepidehshahi> hi Caren_
2018-06-22T17:06:55 <Caren_> Great write up! I\xe2\x80\x99m reading it now. I\xe2\x80\x99ve added a couple of opener tweaks for your consideration so far
2018-06-22T17:11:49 * jhung joined the channel
2018-06-22T17:14:01 <sepidehshahi> great! thank you
2018-06-22T17:16:23 <Caren_> np sepidehshahi
2018-06-22T17:23:51 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: it\xe2\x80\x99s looking really good now! thanks for your edits
2018-06-22T17:24:14 <Caren_> It\xe2\x80\x99s a great write-up sepidehshahi !
2018-06-22T17:24:39 <sepidehshahi> we just need a title for it Caren_
2018-06-22T17:25:33 <Caren_> I like the clarity of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve put down
2018-06-22T17:31:21 <sepidehshahi> great! I\xe2\x80\x99ll create the pull request and the next post will be related to the activity result
2018-06-22T17:32:10 <Caren_> awesome. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to tweet about it on SNOW. Do you know when it will be on the site?
2018-06-22T17:37:54 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: I heard back from one teacher that they are done the activities and the boards are ready for pick up. I will likely have a chat with her when I pick up the boards and will get some anecdotal feedback. I will likely do it Monday or Tuesday in the earlier part of the day. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to come along let me know and we can organize a time and coordinate transportation.
2018-06-22T17:43:25 <sepidehshahi> This is great Caren_! can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see those boards. Do you know which grades have completed the activity?
2018-06-22T17:43:42 <Caren_> grade 5
2018-06-22T17:44:12 <sepidehshahi> and unfortunately I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can make it to the schools next week
2018-06-22T17:44:19 <sepidehshahi> great!
2018-06-22T17:52:14 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked permission to use one of the images from a tweet (no kiddo is visible) for the blog post in case you wanted a visual.

2018-06-22T17:52:56 <sepidehshahi> That would be perfect! I can also use the image of the activity board
2018-06-22T17:53:15 <Caren_> yes!
2018-06-22T17:53:55 <Caren_> have you seen the latest tweets (two top ones): https://twitter.com/lisareid1975
2018-06-22T17:56:21 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: ^
2018-06-22T17:57:52 <sepidehshahi> no Caren_ This is super cool! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad the teacher took this activity so seriously :)
