2018-05-30T13:51:48 <avtar> are you free to meet at 11:00 today?
2018-05-30T13:51:51 <neuralmilkhotel> Yep
2018-05-30T13:52:02 <avtar> awesome, thanks
2018-05-30T13:52:02 <neuralmilkhotel> I love the houses :)
2018-05-30T13:52:05 <neuralmilkhotel> np
2018-05-30T13:52:28 <avtar> still tweaking a few things but i think they should work with the layout you suggested
2018-05-30T13:52:48 <neuralmilkhotel> Yeah!
2018-05-30T13:52:51 <neuralmilkhotel> Thank you
2018-05-30T13:53:11 <avtar> and thank you

2018-05-30T16:01:26 <neuralmilkhotel> The filename is InclusiveCities-Mockup2.pdf sorry it wasn\'t clear

2018-05-30T16:07:34 <gmoss> neuralmilkhotel, avtar, sepidehshahi: so different! I like the idea of the venn diagrams. I\'m wondering about the contrast ratios in each of the sections, I found it a little hard to read the dark grey background. I also wonder how it would look with the illustrations on the left side instead of the right? I find myself drawn to that side and away from the content. the banner image might not work so well on the left
2018-05-30T16:07:48 <gmoss> also I wonder what a responsive narrow version of it would look like
2018-05-30T16:09:52 <neuralmilkhotel> Thanks gmoss! Super helpful

2018-05-30T16:10:29 <gmoss> :)
2018-05-30T16:12:10 <avtar> neuralmilkhotel: i think breaking up the two columns would be interesting. it seems to work for the ideas in progress section but for the \'inclusive design framework\' and \'co-design\' sections perhaps a single column could be used? with the images in place of the text breaks sepidehshahi mentioned on monday
2018-05-30T16:13:43 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar: Should the 1-column Inclusive Design Framework be broken up into two columns, you mean?
2018-05-30T16:14:06 <neuralmilkhotel> Or just one column for both Framework and Co-design
2018-05-30T16:14:13 <neuralmilkhotel> And then just break it w/ the images like you said
2018-05-30T16:15:55 <avtar> neuralmilkhotel: sorry one sec
2018-05-30T16:16:47 <simonjb> I like where the design is going! I\'m getting some similar feels as Geoff Manaugh\'s BLDGBLOG (which I really like) http://www.bldgblog.com/2018/05/sound-house/
2018-05-30T16:22:07 <neuralmilkhotel> fluid-everyone, avtar, simonjb, sepidehshahi, gmoss: Version 2 is InclusiveCities-Mockup2-2.pdf
2018-05-30T16:24:06 <simonjb> I vote #1
2018-05-30T16:26:39 <gmoss> I\'m going to split that and vote #2 :P haha.. this is really interesting to see!
2018-05-30T16:27:07 <simonjb> or another variant maybe worth trying: #1 but with only the Co-Design section with the streetcar switched (text on right, image on left)
2018-05-30T16:27:07 <gmoss> that said, I think the banner image works best on the right of the text, as in #1
2018-05-30T16:27:56 <simonjb> that would preserve most of the #1 layout but offer some variation to break up all text on left
2018-05-30T16:31:35 <avtar> neuralmilkhotel: back
2018-05-30T16:33:06 <avtar> would it be possible to share a version based on your sketch, with the current versions of the homes on the left of the banner?
2018-05-30T16:37:40 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-30T16:37:50 <simonjb> ok, #2 is growing on me -- I do think that having the text vertical flow broken up so that it\'s not just a column on the left is really good
2018-05-30T16:38:19 <simonjb> but in the current #2 I think it\'s maybe a little too irregular
2018-05-30T16:38:52 <simonjb> and I think the banner looks better with image on right and text on left
2018-05-30T16:39:21 <neuralmilkhotel> sepidehshahi suggested using arrows to guide the eye as per InclusiveCities-Mockup2-3.pdf avtar simonjb gmoss
2018-05-30T16:39:34 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar I can do that
2018-05-30T16:40:20 <neuralmilkhotel> simonjb gmoss I\'m confused I need a tally board haha
2018-05-30T16:40:24 <gmoss> neuralmilkhotel sepidehshahi I like it! very subtle way of attracting my attention
2018-05-30T16:40:32 <neuralmilkhotel> gmoss votes for header as #1
2018-05-30T16:40:34 <simonjb> it\'s going to be hard to get the arrows to be in the right places if the user changes the text sizes
2018-05-30T16:40:40 <neuralmilkhotel> simonjb very true haha
2018-05-30T16:40:47 <gmoss> ah yes
2018-05-30T16:40:49 <gmoss> good point simonjb
2018-05-30T16:40:55 <neuralmilkhotel> I forget that this is not print >_<
2018-05-30T16:41:17 <neuralmilkhotel> simonjb so you like the image on right but text on left
2018-05-30T16:41:37 <neuralmilkhotel> In the original sketch as avtar mentioned there would be houses on the left side to balance out the cityscape on the left
2018-05-30T16:41:40 <simonjb> yeah, it needs to be responsive to changes that the user might make -- text size, screen size, shape and such
2018-05-30T16:42:23 <simonjb> and I find that the arrows make the text harder to read
2018-05-30T16:42:58 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar -- I was thinking of adding the houses on the left but I couldn\'t make it symmetrical since the cityscape has a very clean diagonal line
2018-05-30T16:43:01 * colinclark has quit
2018-05-30T16:44:18 <avtar> ah ok
2018-05-30T16:44:58 <simonjb> for me, I think the large text does a reasonable job of balancing the image
2018-05-30T16:45:44 <simonjb> in the heading
2018-05-30T16:45:52 <simonjb> at least on the image right version
2018-05-30T16:46:00 <simonjb> I find the image left version more off balance
2018-05-30T16:46:04 <simonjb> which is interesting
2018-05-30T16:46:29 <simonjb> maybe due to expectation of text being left aligned?
2018-05-30T16:47:30 <avtar> i agree.. with a single image it looks better with the text on the left side
2018-05-30T16:47:32 <simonjb> yes, I think that\'s it -- in the image right version, the text being left aligned forms a vertical
2018-05-30T16:48:01 <simonjb> whereas on the image left version, the text has a ragged right
2018-05-30T16:48:35 <simonjb> which echoes the shape of the image rather than being a mirror
2018-05-30T16:49:15 <simonjb> so, in the image left, evertyhing is pushing to the right
2018-05-30T16:51:48 <neuralmilkhotel> simonjb gmoss avtar sepidehshahi v. 4 InclusiveCities-Mockup2-4.pdf
2018-05-30T16:56:17 <simonjb> I\'m finding the circles in "Ideas In Progress" too close to the ones in the banner
2018-05-30T16:57:06 <simonjb> and I think the layout now is a little too much like a chess board
2018-05-30T16:57:30 <simonjb> I think we\'re getting close though! :)
2018-05-30T17:00:04 <simonjb> could we maybe try Inclusive Design Framework all text left and Co-Design all text right?
2018-05-30T17:00:49 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-30T17:03:31 <simonjb> or
2018-05-30T17:03:43 <simonjb> maybe just #2 but with the banner from #1

2018-05-30T17:28:08 <neuralmilkhotel> Also would moving the sketchy circles to the left be better or remove completely
