2018-01-19T15:19:41 <jhung> gtirloni: got a question about the BIG IDeA contact email you helped me set up last week. Is it possible to have the single email be a distribution?
2018-01-19T15:20:45 <gtirloni> jhung: yes
2018-01-19T15:23:30 <jhung> gtirloni: ok great. Thanks. I'll probably ask you to add an address or two later.
2018-01-19T15:23:38 <gtirloni> ok!
2018-01-19T15:46:06 <jhung> alanharnum: ping
2018-01-19T15:46:17 <alanharnum> jhung: pong
2018-01-19T15:47:24 <jhung> alanharnum: BIG IDeA would like to add Google Analytics to the site. Would you be able to help set it up on the Google account side?
2018-01-19T15:49:23 <alanharnum> jhung: sure thing, do you want to Vidyo and we can do it together?
2018-01-19T15:50:27 <jhung> alanharnum: sure.

2018-01-19T18:24:48 <lliskovoi> Hey clown: I'm having some issues with ARIA combobox, I'm looking at the ARIA Practices examples document, but the example comboboxes on there are not communicated to VoiceOver at all :/ Any thoughts on why this might be happening? Is this a known issue?
2018-01-19T18:24:57 <lliskovoi> I tried on mobile as well, and nothing

2018-01-19T19:19:37 <clown> lliskovoi: hi, just got back from lunch and catching up.
2018-01-19T19:20:33 <clown> and, no, I don't know why the design pattern suggested in ARIA practices doesn't work with VO.  Not off hand anyway; I can think of one place to look.
2018-01-19T19:21:01 <lliskovoi> Clown: I'm just hopping on a quick call, do you have time to chat about this some time in the afternoon?
2018-01-19T19:21:05 <clown> do you know if it that example works with other screen readers?
2018-01-19T19:21:29 <lliskovoi> no, I don't have a PC at home, but I tried desktop and mobile
2018-01-19T19:21:30 <clown> sure, re:  sometime this afternoon.  How about 3:30-ish
2018-01-19T19:21:31 <clown> ?
2018-01-19T19:21:39 <lliskovoi> 3:30 works great
2018-01-19T19:21:52 <clown> cool.

2018-01-19T20:05:01 <gtirloni> TIL https://www.deque.com/products/axe/  ... I like the idea of the user hosting the engine that will make the requests (that is, not achecker's server)
2018-01-19T20:15:04 <jhung> gtirloni: is it possible to replace the current dev.bigidea.one with what is currently in the production site (bigidea.one)? The content on the dev site is now out of sync and I want to make sure my new changes work.
2018-01-19T20:15:59 <gtirloni> yes. it'll replace everything, is that okay?
2018-01-19T20:16:14 <gtirloni> content, users, etc
2018-01-19T20:18:29 <jhung> gtirloni: give me a sec to double-check.
2018-01-19T20:19:47 <jhung> gtirloni: yes it's fine. It's backed up anyway in case we need something. :)
2018-01-19T20:19:59 <gtirloni> ok
2018-01-19T20:20:27 <jhung> thanks gtirloni!!
