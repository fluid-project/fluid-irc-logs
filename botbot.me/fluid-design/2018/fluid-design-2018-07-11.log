2018-07-11T15:27:43 <neuralmilkhotel> fluid-everyone: I\xe2\x80\x99m on hold with the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s so I\xe2\x80\x99ll give my update here in case: Jon was able to transfer my local snow-theme repo into the inclusive-design repo so have started working off of that. Yesterday did some UI tweaks discussed in JIRAs SNOW-25 and SNOW-18. Today going to work on SNOW-27 and that will be my day. Will be coming in after lunch.
2018-07-11T15:28:04 <jhung> thanks neuralmilkhotel

2018-07-11T16:02:35 <jhung> Caren_: got a minute to chat?

2018-07-11T16:49:18 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: hello.. sorry to have had to run yesterday. Thanks for the help with the icons. Is there anything I can do to help you with them?
2018-07-11T16:51:04 <lliskovoi> no prob Justin_o! Will finish up now and ping you once it\'s done :)
2018-07-11T16:53:39 <lliskovoi> Justin_o: neuralmilkhotel has graciously offered to do all the steps related to GitHub and beyond so please follow up with her
2018-07-11T16:55:08 <Justin_o> lliskovoi, neuralmilkhotel: thanks. let me know if you\'d like to talk about anything for it.
2018-07-11T16:55:42 <neuralmilkhotel> Sure thing Justin_o lliskovoi
2018-07-11T16:57:32 <Caren_> hi neuralmilkhotel awesome about JIRAs 18, 25, 27. I\xe2\x80\x99m here today if you have any questions or want me to have a look before closing any of them. I\xe2\x80\x99m off tomorrow but back at the IDRC on Friday. :-)
2018-07-11T16:58:11 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok for sure Caren_ !
2018-07-11T17:00:05 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: You just need the SVG icons in the Github repo?
2018-07-11T17:01:24 * danayo joined the channel
2018-07-11T17:02:18 <neuralmilkhotel> We don\'t need to generate the icon font? Justin_o
2018-07-11T17:04:49 <neuralmilkhotel> Also do we need a JIRA for when I submit a PR to add these icons into the icons repo?
2018-07-11T17:05:22 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: no you don\'t need to generate the icon font, i\'ll be doing a custom one to add to Infusion.
2018-07-11T17:05:30 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok cool Justin_o
2018-07-11T17:06:01 <Caren_> neuralmilkhotel: when you have a moment would you show me (or tell me!) how to get content onto the homepage Feature Article box? That box in particular doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have editing options so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it is an auto feed or something\xe2\x80\xa6? thanks!
2018-07-11T17:06:07 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: hmm.. i guess you should probably use a JIRA, you could either piggy back off of mine or make a specific one.. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6175
2018-07-11T17:06:38 <neuralmilkhotel> Caren_: Ahh thanks for reminding me Caren_ I missed that in the docs
2018-07-11T17:06:47 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok Justin_o
2018-07-11T17:08:14 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: Submitting a PR
2018-07-11T17:08:29 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: great thanks.. please send me the link and i\'ll take a look at it
2018-07-11T17:08:45 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: Here you go: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/pull/5
2018-07-11T17:08:56 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: thanks
2018-07-11T17:12:54 <neuralmilkhotel> np Justin_o
2018-07-11T17:16:12 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: i left a comment, just hoping you can opportunistically also fix a typo for the name of another svg

2018-07-11T17:19:32 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: left one more comment about changing the title in the play and pause svgs
2018-07-11T17:27:05 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: Ok lemme take a look
2018-07-11T17:28:24 <Caren_> sure neuralmilkhotel I\xe2\x80\x99m opening Vidyo now
2018-07-11T17:28:30 <neuralmilkhotel> Thx Caren_ !
2018-07-11T17:28:58 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: re: the title element -- is that in the SVG code itself from when the icon was generated/exported from Illustrator?
2018-07-11T17:29:49 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: yes, it would have come from there. You can either look into how it was exported or probably just manually modify the svg code.
2018-07-11T17:30:33 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok Justin_o
2018-07-11T17:38:15 <danayo> sepidehshahi, simonjb did you want to meet to talk about evaluation?

2018-07-11T18:46:24 <Caren_> Hi jhung, neuralmilkhotel milk made some adjustments to the 3 panels (boxes) on the SNOW home page so I can load Featured Articles and customize live content for Workshops. At the same time adjustments were made to the Twitter feed that seems to have solved the issues you and I spoke about earlier today.  :D
2018-07-11T18:48:37 <jhung> Awesome. So can you confirm these issues fixed Caren_? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SNOW-32
2018-07-11T18:51:14 <Caren_> yes! confirmed SNOW-32 resolved  thanks jhung and neuralmilkhotel
2018-07-11T18:55:26 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel, lliskovoi: are the play and pause icons mislabeled? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/pull/5
2018-07-11T18:55:45 <Justin_o> it looks like the right pointing arrow is called pause and the two bars are called play
2018-07-11T18:56:30 <lliskovoi> you\'re right Justin_o, I must have mislabeled the art boards
2018-07-11T18:56:59 <lliskovoi> I\'ll fix it in the illustrator file, do I need to re-export them?
2018-07-11T18:58:55 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: maybe. neuralmilkhotel would you prefer to have them re-exported or fix the naming manually?
2018-07-11T18:58:59 <neuralmilkhotel> lliskovoi: Justin_o: I\'ll just rename
2018-07-11T18:59:29 <lliskovoi> thanks! I corrected the dartboards in the illustrator file
2018-07-11T19:00:27 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel, lliskovoi: thanks
2018-07-11T19:01:52 <jhung> Caren_: I\'ve closed SNOW-32 now it\'s been addressed.
2018-07-11T19:02:17 <Caren_> thanks jhung
2018-07-11T19:03:44 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: we are distributing the inclusive cities link in several emails. I was wondering if you have seen any new members signing up for that mailing list.

2018-07-11T20:03:02 <Caren_> neuralmilkhotel: jhung Am I able to change the name of a category myself? for example I\xe2\x80\x99m considering changing Technology in the Classroom to The Inclusive Classroom. I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the menu name to see how it works but Technology in the Classroom remains as the category. Have I explained that clearly (as mud)?
2018-07-11T20:03:38 <neuralmilkhotel> Caren_: Yes they are two separate things
2018-07-11T20:04:20 <neuralmilkhotel> You\'d need to change it under Posts/Pages > Categories > Choose your category > Edit
2018-07-11T20:04:37 <neuralmilkhotel> But I\'m not sure if you change the slug (the url path) if that will propagate to the rest of the pages or will it break all links?
2018-07-11T20:04:49 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: Do you know? (I know you\'re a meeting so take your time :)
