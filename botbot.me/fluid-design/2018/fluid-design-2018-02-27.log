2018-02-27T21:36:27 <alanharnum> thanks danayo!
2018-02-27T21:36:56 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo
2018-02-27T21:38:55 <danayo> sepidehshahi: jutta mentioned that we have a \xe2\x80\x9cpetals\xe2\x80\x9d mapping graphic with the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d simplification, but that the text is too small to read - do you know where this is?
2018-02-27T21:39:19 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo, let me send you a link
2018-02-27T21:41:13 <danayo> thanks
2018-02-27T21:41:51 <danayo> alanharnum, michelled: I like these prompt questions that Jutta mentioned today: - think of the most joyful learning opportunity you had - what were the characteristics of that learning experience? What was the most difficult? What were the characteristics?
2018-02-27T21:42:01 <danayo> I think it might be good to incorporate them into the learning reflections page
2018-02-27T21:42:31 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99ll think about what we have there already and how we might do that - dont\xe2\x80\x99 want to have too many prompts!
2018-02-27T21:42:47 <sepidehshahi> danayo: all visuals are saved under IDRC-Design > Inclusive Tools and Resources > Flowers & Petals and here is the diagram she was referring to: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/TpClI6jow7x9vdP
2018-02-27T21:44:06 <danayo> avtar: when we met with Jutta today she mentioned wanting to update the guide to reflect the idea that it is a scaffold, a trellis, a supporting structure, (rather than t a list of sacred, prescriptive processes) - I think we need to mention this in the video script
2018-02-27T21:44:20 <danayo> and maybe even use some imagery to capture the idea?
2018-02-27T21:44:34 <danayo> sorry I know it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of late in the process
2018-02-27T21:45:03 <danayo> but maybe we can just add something very brief to the script at the very least
2018-02-27T21:45:11 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2018-02-27T21:45:21 <sepidehshahi> yw
2018-02-27T22:02:03 <avtar> danayo: are you free to chat about script changes at some point today?

2018-02-27T22:15:14 <alanharnum> in the "I really should suspend my Facebook and Twitter account" files: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/technology/smartphones-mental-health.html?smid=tw-share
2018-02-27T22:15:30 <alanharnum> "Your digital footprint \xe2\x80\x94 how often you post on social media, how quickly you scroll through your contacts, how frequently you check your phone late at night \xe2\x80\x94 could hold clues to your physical and mental health. That at least is the theory behind an emerging field, digital phenotyping, that is trying to assess people\xe2\x80\x99s well-being based on their interactions with digital devices."
2018-02-27T22:16:57 <danayo> avtar: sure I can meet now briefly if that works for you? I was just trying to come up with a good one-liner that we can inject into the script
2018-02-27T22:18:30 <avtar> ok, one sec
2018-02-27T22:20:25 <danayo> OMG alanharnum
2018-02-27T22:21:21 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah some of the stuff in that article is flat-out "smash my smartphone" level of wigs me out
2018-02-27T22:21:30 <michelled> alanharnum: did you see this new (related) curb cut? https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html
2018-02-27T22:21:41 <michelled> grey scale to reduce phone addiction
2018-02-27T22:22:21 <danayo> interesting michelled !
2018-02-27T22:22:24 <alanharnum> and interesting to think about side by side with all the recent research on how smartphones can effect people in terms of anxiety and depression
2018-02-27T22:23:33 <alanharnum> michelled: oh neat
2018-02-27T22:23:38 <alanharnum> i\'m going to see if i can do that to mine right now
2018-02-27T22:24:14 <gmoss> alanharnum danayo michelled: relevant to this discussion - https://youtu.be/NUMa0QkPzns
2018-02-27T22:24:15 <michelled> I really enjoyed this podcast https://art19.com/shows/the-ezra-klein-show/episodes/9bead20d-767f-48b3-aaab-a1b5a21cf8fd but of course I\'m a sucker for anything that references Thich Nhat Hanh
2018-02-27T22:24:55 <gmoss> the video I linked mentions setting your device to greyscale to mitigate addictive tendencies

2018-02-27T20:43:32 <danayo> sepidehshahi: thanks! yes will definitely need some - would be good to check in with Caren to see where the latest is - do you know if the latest tornado is in owncloud? is that what we looked at today?
2018-02-27T20:44:11 <danayo> sepidehshahi, alanharnum, jhung I will start a google doc for the text content
2018-02-27T20:47:16 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I have not seen the tornado diagram Caren has created
2018-02-27T20:47:26 <danayo> ok
2018-02-27T20:47:41 <danayo> oh look there\xe2\x80\x99s carenwatkins!
2018-02-27T20:47:45 <danayo> hi carenwatkins
2018-02-27T20:47:46 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with her
2018-02-27T20:48:05 <sepidehshahi> :)
2018-02-27T20:48:16 <carenwatkins> hi danayo
2018-02-27T20:48:21 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99m back :-)
2018-02-27T20:49:25 <carenwatkins> danayo: sepidehshahi Did Jutta show you a multi-coloured tornado with pictures of people coming out of the sides?
2018-02-27T20:49:42 <sepidehshahi> no C
2018-02-27T20:49:43 <danayo> no carenwatkins - no people
2018-02-27T20:49:51 <danayo> we saw some older versions
2018-02-27T20:50:02 <carenwatkins> Ah, ok.
2018-02-27T20:50:20 <carenwatkins> I have not built any tornados
2018-02-27T20:52:42 <carenwatkins> the multi coloured one is being built by Dorin for Platform Co-op funding requirements. I\xe2\x80\x99m helping to stick handle.
2018-02-27T20:52:48 <danayo> ah
2018-02-27T20:53:20 <danayo> can you show us the latest carenwatkins ?
2018-02-27T20:53:55 <carenwatkins> I have a screen snap in email. I can forward it to you if you like danayo
2018-02-27T20:54:10 <danayo> that would be great thanks
2018-02-27T20:54:20 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99ll include the design brief I put together as well.
2018-02-27T20:54:37 <sepidehshahi> thanks carenwatkins
2018-02-27T20:54:37 <danayo> great

2018-02-27T21:07:59 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just noticed that we have also included \xe2\x80\x98inclusive design mapping\xe2\x80\x99 as one of the activities.
2018-02-27T21:08:25 <carenwatkins> np ! if you have any feedback I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to pass it along to Dorin et al.
2018-02-27T21:08:26 <danayo> you mean in the Guide, sepidehshahi ?
2018-02-27T21:08:39 <carenwatkins> sepidehshahi: danayo ^
2018-02-27T21:08:49 <sepidehshahi> maybe we could use that as a base and build this new activity on top of that so you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to explain so many things in one activity
2018-02-27T21:09:12 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo
2018-02-27T21:16:05 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^ or we could have a multi-step activity. So we can modify the current mapping tool, make the facets less formal (using Jutta\xe2\x80\x99s photos) and use it as step one and then have another activity to take the facets through the tornado
2018-02-27T21:16:52 <danayo> sepidehshahi: yeah, i wonder - i don\xe2\x80\x99t think jutta said whether or not she wants to keep the more detailed activity, did she?
2018-02-27T21:18:31 <sepidehshahi> no she didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but she emphasized on keeping it less formal danayo
2018-02-27T21:18:46 <danayo> yes
2018-02-27T21:19:26 <sepidehshahi> and she said she only uses the two sections (can\xe2\x80\x99t use design, having difficulty) and let the rest flow with no categorization
2018-02-27T21:19:41 <danayo> yes
2018-02-27T21:20:04 <danayo> I think a multi-step activity makes sense sepidehshahi
2018-02-27T21:21:35 <danayo> i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if making the tornado a separate activity makes sense or not sepidehshahi - maybe as we work out the description it will become clear - or at least I feel like I need to get my head around it a bit more
2018-02-27T21:21:55 <sepidehshahi> for sure danayo
2018-02-27T21:23:44 <danayo> tornado: how do we get to the edges, how do we iterate, what do we introduce at each step - that\xe2\x80\x99s the planning part/tool, as jutta said - but I think the mapping has to come first, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand alone ?
2018-02-27T21:23:49 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2018-02-27T21:24:03 <danayo> the tornado doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand alone, I mean
2018-02-27T21:24:39 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-02-27T21:28:00 <sepidehshahi> absolutely danayo, I think as alanharnum mentioned the tornado is more like a visual representation of the iterative process, the only thing Jutta added was that the tornado cycles keep getting larger and larger and encompassing more and more people as we go through this process
