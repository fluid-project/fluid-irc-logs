2018-08-21T13:24:46 <Justin_o> no problem.. the mailing list was down most of the weekend though, but Gio got it fixed up
2018-08-21T13:24:49 <Justin_o> well part of the weekend

2018-08-21T15:44:27 <danayo> hi gtirloni, not sure if I should ask you or alanharnum, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the name of the platform coop mailing list has been changed? there was talk of changing it from platform-coop-toolkit to platform-coop-development-kit. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to start using it and suggesting that others do too but am not sure which one to use.
2018-08-21T15:48:42 <alanharnum> danayo gtirloni: we still need to look into changing the send email address, which is more complicated than just changing the displayed name (which I believe has been done)
2018-08-21T15:48:53 <alanharnum> i'll have a look this afternoon
2018-08-21T15:51:34 <danayo> thanks alanharnum
2018-08-21T15:52:49 <danayo> what a pain alanharnum, if it\xe2\x80\x99s too complicated let me know - I think we can argue that we just proceed to use it as-is
2018-08-21T15:55:32 <danayo> or can we just start a new list alanharnum, and abandon the old one? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are too many members yet?
2018-08-21T15:56:08 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah that second one is an option, but let me spend a bit of time on it this afternoon
2018-08-21T15:56:16 <danayo> ok great thanks

2018-08-21T18:23:59 <simonjb> hi sepidehshahi, are we going to do a run-through of the activities this afternoon? I *think* I'm done the Hugo conversion and just need an hour to an hour and a half to do checks and to make the pull request. I didn't want to start if we're going to get together.
2018-08-21T18:24:30 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: we are going to meet at 2:30
2018-08-21T18:24:37 <simonjb> great, thanks

2018-08-21T18:54:27 <jhung> Justin_o: who at the IDRC has worked with the Web Speech API aside from yourself?
2018-08-21T18:54:45 <Justin_o> Alan, maybe Colin.. not sure who else
2018-08-21T18:56:06 <jhung> ok. I'm going to include both of you on an email w PhET. They're looking into strategies into managing text alerts and were curious about using the Web Speech API as a possible strategy for providing feedback outside of the screen reader.
2018-08-21T18:56:11 <jhung> ^ Justin_o
2018-08-21T18:56:32 <Justin_o> okay.. when  screen reader isn't running or when it is?
2018-08-21T18:57:50 <jhung> I suspect in both cases Justin_o. I think they're looking for a better way of providing text alerts to the end user, but the event system isn't great (key press events may happen quick, so text alerts experience isn't great).

2018-08-21T18:58:35 <Justin_o> okay.. don't know how well it will work with a screen reader running though
2018-08-21T18:59:19 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah. I don't know how well it would work either.
