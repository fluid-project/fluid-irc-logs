2018-01-23T15:48:23 <jhung> When you press Stop recording it "closes" the recording and then gives you 3 options to add a title, edit, or delete.

2018-01-23T16:24:29 <Justin_o> danayo, gmoss, colinclark: follow up question to the meeting... does using the story telling tool assume a license for the content or does the author get to decide? I think either way it would be good to add the license in and also if the it is decided per user/per story, to have a field to add one.. maybe from a drop down.
2018-01-23T16:24:29 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-01-23T16:24:57 <Justin_o> also we might be able to make use of some of our metadata work for adding the meta data tags for the audio and images.
2018-01-23T16:25:09 <gmoss> Justin_o: that\'s a very good question
2018-01-23T16:26:00 <gmoss> I agree that it would be good to make the licence under which the storyteller is telling their story explicit, and/or to give them the option to choose a particular licence
2018-01-23T16:32:06 <colinclark> licensing is a very good question
2018-01-23T16:32:30 <danayo> thanks Justin_o good questions

2018-01-23T17:11:15 <jhung> Justin_o: I have a friend who is a speech language pathologist - I\'ll ask her if she knows of an example. :)
2018-01-23T17:12:28 <Justin_o> jhung: oh great thanks.. :)
2018-01-23T17:16:38 <jhung> Justin_o: Does "Worcestershire sauce" count?
2018-01-23T17:17:41 <Justin_o> does anyone know how to pronounce that properly?
2018-01-23T17:17:48 <jhung> There\'s also "Scarborough"\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ve heard it pronounced "Scarbra"

2018-01-23T17:19:50 * clown joined the channel
2018-01-23T17:23:30 <jhung> "Worcestershire" is 4 syllables even if pronounced poorly.
2018-01-23T17:32:59 <gmoss> jhung Justin_o IIRC it\'s three syllables when pronounced "properly", so this seems like a very good trial word, to me :)
2018-01-23T17:34:09 <jhung> There you go! :)
