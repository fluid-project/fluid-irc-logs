2018-01-26T15:19:35 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: the icons are updated. I enlarged the arrowheads and the type, changed the keyboard icon and fixed the dictionary. let me know if other changes are needed. btw, I ended up using the word \xe2\x80\x98YOYO\xe2\x80\x99 for syllabification :)

2018-01-26T15:49:20 <jhung> sepidehshahi: Justin_o is out and should be back around 12:30 / 1p.
2018-01-26T15:49:44 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks jhung
2018-01-26T15:49:54 <jhung> Or maybe he's back? I see him responding in the other channel.
2018-01-26T15:50:24 <jhung> It only means Justin_o is purposely ignoring you sepidehshahi!!! :D
2018-01-26T15:50:51 <sepidehshahi> :D maybe! he is done with UIO icons!!!
2018-01-26T15:51:05 <jhung> rofl
2018-01-26T15:51:23 <Justin_o> sorry, i'm here.. i just didn't get to opening this channel  yet.
2018-01-26T15:52:11 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: did you see Caren_'s comment about the arrows
2018-01-26T15:56:00 <sepidehshahi> Yes Justin_o I saw her comment. I can replace our current arrows with ones that Caren_ has suggested. I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure if stroke arrows are visible at such small size. the solid arrows I think work better for the UIO scenario. But I can certainly try and compare the results
2018-01-26T16:07:25 <danayo> jhung, Justin_o: I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find the wiki page where we were brainstorming GSoC ideas (want to put our guide idea onto the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d wiki page) - could you drop me a link?
2018-01-26T16:08:32 <Justin_o> danayo: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/January+9+Design+Crit+-+GSOC+Brainstorming
2018-01-26T16:09:12 <danayo> ah thanks Justin_o - I was looking under Community Meetings, but it was a crit :)
2018-01-26T16:09:54 <Justin_o> yes, usually we would have done it in a community meeting so it makes sense to have looked there
2018-01-26T16:37:42 <alanharnum> is anyone else getting super-choppy audio from Vidyo?
2018-01-26T16:46:13 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-01-26T16:47:07 <danayo> jhung: I added the project description here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2018+with+the+Fluid+Project
2018-01-26T16:47:19 <danayo> wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure the level of difficulty or skills to list
2018-01-26T16:49:16 <danayo> fluid-everyone: would anyone else be interested in co-mentoring the project with me? It\xe2\x80\x99s the Inclusive Design Guide Digital-Print copy workflow prototypes ^
2018-01-26T16:49:33 * clown hides
2018-01-26T16:49:42 <danayo> I see you clown!
2018-01-26T16:49:49 * clown has left the channel
2018-01-26T16:49:53 <danayo> hahahahah
2018-01-26T16:49:53 <Justin_o> alanharnum: sorry, just saw your message.. the audio was fine for me
2018-01-26T16:50:49 <Justin_o> danayo: i'm not sure what my availability will be like for pretty much the rest of the year.. but i could potentially be a co-co-mentor.... I'll likely be away all of June though
2018-01-26T16:50:55 * clown joined the channel
2018-01-26T16:51:49 <danayo> sounds like we\xe2\x80\x99d still need someone else Justin_o
2018-01-26T16:52:11 <danayo> thanks though, it would be good to have to co-co-mentor :)
2018-01-26T16:52:12 <gmoss> danayo: I'm willing to help, though I've never done this before and may need a co-co-co-mentor to show me the ropes ;)
2018-01-26T16:52:56 <danayo> sorry, meant *it would be good to have you co-co-mentor Justin_o
2018-01-26T16:53:57 <sepidehshahi> fluid-everyone: I am also looking for someone who can co-mentor the project \xe2\x80\x98import external data to MyL3\xe2\x80\x99 with me :)
2018-01-26T16:54:03 <danayo> gmoss: thanks, by never done this before you\xe2\x80\x99re refering to mentoring a GSoC project?
2018-01-26T16:54:26 <Justin_o> gmoss: we tend to mentor as a group in that we encourage the students to ask questions on list and in the channel. The direct mentors though would be responsible for things like evaluations, helping to select the student, meeting with them regularly, and making sure they are on track.
2018-01-26T16:54:38 <danayo> all these fabulous projects and designers to work with sepidehshahi - how will they choose??? :D
2018-01-26T16:54:51 <sepidehshahi> :D
2018-01-26T16:55:32 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i wonder if you could convince simon and maybe michelled to co-mentor yours?
2018-01-26T16:55:57 <danayo> michelled: meet now?
2018-01-26T16:56:12 <gmoss> danayo: yes, that's correct, I've never mentored a GSoC project before. Justin_o thanks for the breakdown! I know you gave me one during the design crit but some of my memory of it had faded away in the meantime. This sounds like something I can do :)
2018-01-26T16:56:22 <danayo> it\xe2\x80\x99s fun gmoss
2018-01-26T16:56:28 <danayo> in my experience
2018-01-26T16:57:22 <Justin_o> gmoss: np and you can always consult with me and others if you have questions/concerns
2018-01-26T16:57:25 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: I think Simon mentioned that he is not interested in mentoring this year\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-01-26T16:57:52 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: :( okay
2018-01-26T16:59:06 <michelled> I'd be fine with it - as long as we select a student who is very much a self starter
2018-01-26T17:00:10 <danayo> michelled: can you meet now?
2018-01-26T17:00:38 <michelled> yes! call me

2018-01-26T17:53:33 <danayo> oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re right michelled, I do!
2018-01-26T17:53:37 <danayo> very much! :)
2018-01-26T17:54:01 <danayo> And Also Too is super cool - Una Lee was involved with the Design Justice zine as well
2018-01-26T17:54:06 <danayo> Sasha mentioned her yesterday
2018-01-26T17:55:23 <michelled> I also met her when I went the hackathon a few years ago
2018-01-26T17:55:27 <michelled> she's really awesome
2018-01-26T17:55:46 <danayo> oh cool
2018-01-26T17:56:42 <danayo> interesting to think about - we didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word consent in our privacy work - consentful tech - I like it
2018-01-26T17:56:46 <danayo> michelled^

2018-01-26T20:25:40 <danayo> I like what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but I find this interface overwhelming
2018-01-26T20:25:46 <danayo> there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on
2018-01-26T20:26:57 <danayo> they\xe2\x80\x99ve created machine-annotated and manually-annotated privacy policies
2018-01-26T20:27:29 <michelled> whoa, I see what you mean by a lot going on!
2018-01-26T20:27:38 <michelled> it's so great to see this work progressing though
2018-01-26T20:28:42 <danayo> absolutely

2018-01-26T20:29:19 <danayo> The Usable Privacy Policy Project develops techniques to semi-automatically analyze privacy policies with crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning.
2018-01-26T20:30:42 <danayo> michelled: there\xe2\x80\x99s an interactive tour/tutorial - it didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up the first time I accessed the page
2018-01-26T20:30:57 <michelled> oh cool
2018-01-26T20:31:24 <danayo> it seems like the human-annotated ones might be a lot easier to understand - go figure!
