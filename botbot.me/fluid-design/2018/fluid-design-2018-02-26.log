2018-02-26T18:51:58 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Does anyone have a topic for tomorrow\'s design crit?
2018-02-26T18:52:13 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t jhung
2018-02-26T18:52:44 <jhung> Does anyone know if dayotte or Caren_ would have something to share?
2018-02-26T18:54:03 <jhung> I would like to share about a prototype keyboard interaction for PhET, and the "new" Wordpress editor which can be a new opportunity to revive the old metadata editor (jessm, Ned @ Pressbooks was the one who brought it to my attention).

2018-02-26T20:58:56 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: which CDN do we use to get jQuery (if we\'ve used jQuery in any of our projects)?
2018-02-26T20:59:23 <grrrero> Also gmoss: Do you remember where the CSS file was in infusion that showed different ways to show/display content for screen readers?
2018-02-26T20:59:56 <gmoss> grrrero: lemme go find it real quick..
2018-02-26T21:00:00 <grrrero> Thanks gmoss!
2018-02-26T21:00:27 <gmoss> grrrero: infusion/src/framework/core/css/fluid.css
2018-02-26T21:00:34 <grrrero> Nice, thanks so much gmoss
2018-02-26T21:03:30 <gmoss> grrrero: np! and I can\'t speak for all of our projects, but I believe infusion has jQuery stuff built into it, and many functions in infusion directly call underlying jQuery functions. someone should correct me if I\'m wrong :)
2018-02-26T21:03:50 <grrrero> gmoss: Ahhh right
2018-02-26T21:04:22 <gmoss> grrrero: what are you trying to do? I might be able to help (emphasis on the "might" ;))
2018-02-26T21:05:05 <grrrero> gmoss: I\'m working on the FLOE resources page -- and I want to be able to toggle or show/hide content of categories of links
2018-02-26T21:07:15 <gmoss> grrrero: ah, well let\'s say you\'ve got a component x, you can do x.locate("selector"), which should return an element or jQuery object, and then you can call .hide() and .show() on them directly
2018-02-26T21:07:33 <gmoss> grrrero: or you can make IoC references like {that}.dom.selectorName
2018-02-26T21:08:08 <gmoss> grrrero: that last bit you might do if you were passing that value into a js function, then the receiving parameter is an element that you can call those functions on
2018-02-26T21:08:52 <gmoss> *or a collection of them, I might have that slightly wrong. in any case, I hope that\'s helpful!\\
2018-02-26T21:09:36 <grrrero> I\'m not sure if the full version of infusion is in FLOE
2018-02-26T21:09:44 <grrrero> It\'s including this: lib/infusion/infusion-custom.js
2018-02-26T21:09:57 <grrrero> plus UIO
2018-02-26T21:15:24 <grrrero> Ah
2018-02-26T21:15:46 <grrrero> It does have jQuery functions
2018-02-26T21:17:51 <gmoss> hmm.. does it seem to have the functions you need?
2018-02-26T21:22:03 <grrrero> gmoss: Yeah it\'s got a show/hide function
2018-02-26T21:24:10 <gmoss> grrrero: great :)
2018-02-26T21:28:27 <grrrero> Thanks for the help gmoss!
2018-02-26T21:33:43 <gmoss> grrrero: np! Any time
2018-02-26T22:03:29 <gmoss> alanharnum: ping
2018-02-26T22:03:56 <alanharnum> gmoss: ping - about to go out to pick up something from my vet, but got a few minutes
2018-02-26T22:04:17 <gmoss> alanharnum: okay, it\'s just one of those works-in-dev-but-fails-in-prod issues with encoding
2018-02-26T22:04:29 <alanharnum> ah those are always the best
2018-02-26T22:04:48 <gmoss> https://stories.floeproject.org/ the heart bullets don\'t show properly for me, i see an a, a box and a thingy
2018-02-26T22:05:18 <gmoss> "\xc3\xa2\xc2\x9d\xc2\xa4 " instead of "\xe2\x9d\xa4 "
2018-02-26T22:06:05 <gmoss> it can wait :)
2018-02-26T22:06:08 <alanharnum> gmoss: ah, that\'s probably because I put the unicode in directly
2018-02-26T22:06:16 <alanharnum> if you replace it with the hex format for Unicode it should work
2018-02-26T22:06:27 <gmoss> alanharnum: makes sense. I\'ll give it a shot!
2018-02-26T22:06:28 <gmoss> thanks
2018-02-26T22:06:54 <alanharnum> there should also be an image version of the actual heart danayo used in the design, which would be better to use
2018-02-26T22:08:38 <alanharnum> ok gotta run to vet!
