b"2018-01-18T21:29:06 <Justin_o> nice of them to make things worse with new versions
2018-01-18T21:29:12 <grrrero> I know >_>
2018-01-18T21:37:03 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay.. i think that solved the problem.. i'm going to write up an e-mail to you jon and sepideh to summarize things..
2018-01-18T21:37:15 <grrrero> Sounds good Justin_i

2018-01-18T19:12:19 <grrrero> Justin_o: What was the workflow/steps you did
2018-01-18T19:12:45 <Justin_o> grrrero: did you want to chat?
2018-01-18T19:12:52 <grrrero> Sure
2018-01-18T19:13:55 <danayo_> sepidehshahi: the visual guide looks great, thanks for creating it!

2018-01-18T19:19:24 <jhung> I found that FF can sometimes be odd with fonts. Try Chrome?

2018-01-18T19:30:15 <colinclark> hey danayo, did you read that equityXdesign article that Jutta sent along the other day?
2018-01-18T19:33:05 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-01-18T19:35:41 <danayo> colinclark I read some of it and looked at each of their sites/work
2018-01-18T19:35:55 <colinclark> It\'s pretty interesting
2018-01-18T19:35:56 <danayo> they are doing some really great work!
2018-01-18T19:35:58 <danayo> yes
2018-01-18T19:37:22 <danayo> this is so good colinclark: We are living in a "colorblind" society that often recognizes racism as anomalous, individual acts of aggression or the mere acknowledgment of difference, not the silent structures that continue to divide.
2018-01-18T19:37:31 <colinclark> yes!
2018-01-18T19:38:20 <colinclark> grrrero: ace description of the community meeting :)
2018-01-18T19:38:36 <grrrero> colinclark: Most kudos to jhung! :)
2018-01-18T19:38:43 <colinclark> thanks for writing it grrrero and thanks for advising, jhung
2018-01-18T19:38:52 <danayo> oh wow and this colinclark: The rise of identity-based aggression cannot distract us from recognizing anchoring systems of oppression and how they manifest in the lives of people.
2018-01-18T19:39:06 <grrrero> colinclark: Team High Five
2018-01-18T19:39:15 <jhung> lol
2018-01-18T19:39:16 <colinclark> i didn\'t mean to put you on the spot, just that jhung and I had just finished talking about it and i was interested in his interpretation of the idea being the one we used
2018-01-18T19:39:50 <colinclark> I\'m really quite fascinating by this one...
2018-01-18T19:39:53 <grrrero> colinclark jhung All good!
2018-01-18T19:39:59 <colinclark> and in "amplifying it" in some interesting ways
2018-01-18T19:40:02 <colinclark> "Instead of asking individuals to think their way into a new way of behaving, relying on their individual levels of awareness around issues of inequity, we can provide them with a framework that embeds that awareness."
2018-01-18T19:40:36 <colinclark> As I read the first half of the sentence, I was thinking less of "frameworks," danayo, and more about... I don\'t know what the word is... movement
2018-01-18T19:40:42 <colinclark> literally and metaphorically
2018-01-18T19:41:22 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-01-18T19:41:30 <colinclark> So instead of "thinking" new ways, how about "improvising," "modelling," "speculating," "creating" new ways of behaving?

2018-01-18T19:42:53 * lliskovoi has quit
2018-01-18T19:44:00 <colinclark> I love the emphasis on historical context, too
2018-01-18T19:44:02 <danayo> colinclark: yeah framework feels too ... vague maybe? or almost too gentle?
2018-01-18T19:44:06 <danayo> wasn\'t sure what you meant by "...interested in his interpretation of the idea being the one we used"
2018-01-18T19:44:11 <colinclark> and maybe cerebral, too
2018-01-18T19:44:27 <colinclark> I guess that\'s always been part of my sense of ambivalence for "design thinking"
2018-01-18T19:44:37 <colinclark> is that the risk is that it takes the action heart out of design
2018-01-18T19:45:18 <danayo> makes me think of this saying: you can\'t think your way into right action, you need to act your way into right thinking
2018-01-18T19:45:31 <colinclark> that\'s brilliant
2018-01-18T19:45:36 <colinclark> that\'s absolutely it :)
2018-01-18T19:45:53 <danayo> concrete action
2018-01-18T19:45:57 <danayo> makes change
2018-01-18T19:46:34 <colinclark> yup
2018-01-18T19:46:46 <colinclark> There\'s also my friend Eldritch\'s great saying
2018-01-18T19:46:56 <colinclark> "A still body is still a body doing" or something like that
2018-01-18T19:47:14 <colinclark> meaning that thinking still has effects
2018-01-18T19:47:33 <danayo> oh interesting, I took it to mean that inaction is a conscious choice
2018-01-18T19:47:40 <danayo> a non-action action
2018-01-18T19:47:46 <colinclark> that\'s entirely true, too
2018-01-18T19:47:48 <danayo> i.e. choosing to be silent
2018-01-18T19:47:53 <danayo> for example
2018-01-18T19:48:05 <colinclark> yup, that seems an entirely apt reading of it
2018-01-18T19:49:17 <Justin_o> jhung, grrrero: I was looking at this issue for grunt-webfont https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont/issues/321
2018-01-18T19:49:38 <Justin_o> and got to this comment https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont/issues/321#issuecomment-341413661
2018-01-18T19:49:58 <grrrero> Interesting Justin_o
2018-01-18T19:49:59 <Justin_o> so i think perhaps we need to make the svgs 512x512 and use the default values for fontHeight, ascent, and descent
2018-01-18T19:50:11 <grrrero> Yeah we were just talking about the dimensions
2018-01-18T19:50:22 <grrrero> Makes sense to make them 512
2018-01-18T19:50:27 <Justin_o> i did a quick test and it seemed to work
2018-01-18T19:50:31 <grrrero> Nice!
2018-01-18T19:50:53 <Justin_o> jhung, grrrero: do you know if there is an easy way to increase the size of all of the icons?
2018-01-18T19:51:34 <Justin_o> i guess i could use the node library they mention in the comment if there isn\'t  better way.. we\'ll also need to update the actions and master ai file though if this is the fix
2018-01-18T19:51:59 <grrrero> Justin_o: We could likely just create an action that we can use on all the icons to make them 512x512?
2018-01-18T19:52:24 <Justin_o> grrrero: that makes sense.. how hard would it be for you to make that?
2018-01-18T19:52:27 <Justin_o> or for me
2018-01-18T19:52:40 <grrrero> Looking now... Illustrator menus are so hard to figure out haha Justin_o
2018-01-18T19:52:47 <Justin_o> haha i know
2018-01-18T19:53:05 <Justin_o> actually i wonder if i can just change the action you wrote before.. i\'m going to look at thaat
2018-01-18T19:53:14 <jhung> Justin_o: there may be a way to do that using xconvert?
2018-01-18T19:53:31 <Justin_o> jhung: what is xconvert
2018-01-18T19:53:55 <jhung> sorry XnConvert - a batch image processor which includes resizing.
2018-01-18T19:53:55 <grrrero> Justin_o: You\'ll also need to resize the artboard
2018-01-18T19:54:13 <grrrero> Justin_o: OR I have an action that will resize the artboard once the new size is selected
2018-01-18T19:54:39 <jhung> Justin_o: you can also try imagemagick
2018-01-18T19:54:55 <danayo> colinclark: maybe "Instead of asking individuals to think their way into a new way of behaving, relying on their individual levels of awareness around issues of inequity, we can provide them with THINGS TO DO." :)
2018-01-18T19:55:00 <danayo> I guess the challenge is generating the motivation to do those things.
2018-01-18T19:55:53 <Justin_o> grrrero: i\'m going to try hacking your previous script.. i just changed 64.0 to 512.0 and will see if that works
2018-01-18T20:01:17 <grrrero> Justin_o: ok let me know if that works
2018-01-18T20:01:45 <Justin_o> it expanded the icon but not the artboard.. i had to do that manually
2018-01-18T20:01:50 <Justin_o> am i using it wrong?
2018-01-18T20:02:47 <grrrero> Select the icon
2018-01-18T20:03:00 <grrrero> And choose "align to selection"
2018-01-18T20:03:12 <grrrero> Under the "Align" menu beside Transform and Pathfinder
2018-01-18T20:03:24 <grrrero> Oh wait
2018-01-18T20:03:25 <grrrero> Nvm
2018-01-18T20:04:53 <grrrero> You wanna jump on Vidyo real quick Justin_o?
2018-01-18T20:05:10 <Justin_o> yes, please
2018-01-18T20:06:48 <colinclark> danayo: That\'s a perfect reworking! :)
2018-01-18T20:07:09 <colinclark> and kind of a nice lens to think of our codesign activities through
2018-01-18T20:07:44 <colinclark> what are we giving the participants, including ourselves, to do?
2018-01-18T20:07:48 <colinclark> beyond coming to a workshop

2018-01-18T21:09:46 <Justin_o> grrrero: i\'ve been thinking about the scaling and not sure it\'s correct actually.. for example if we have an icon like https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/blob/master/svg/word-space-far.svg
2018-01-18T21:09:53 <Justin_o> we want to scale it proportionally
2018-01-18T21:10:01 <grrrero> Yup we wanna constrain proportions
2018-01-18T21:10:09 <grrrero> My actions for scaling were supposed to do that
2018-01-18T21:10:18 <grrrero> There\'s like a "chain" icon
2018-01-18T21:10:37 <grrrero> That if you select it will resize accdg to height or width to 512 and then automatically calculate the rest
2018-01-18T21:10:47 <Justin_o> okay
2018-01-18T21:10:59 <Justin_o> i see.. so you only use one or the other of your transformations, not both
2018-01-18T21:11:21 <grrrero> it\'ll work for *some* but not all, hence why we need one to adjust accdg to either the width or the height
2018-01-18T21:11:27 <grrrero> If that makes sense
2018-01-18T21:11:57 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure that link got recorded.. i think it\'s a local setting.. so we should probably mention that in the doc
2018-01-18T21:13:38 <grrrero> In my actions file I\'ve got "Scale to 64px width" and "Scale to 64px height"
2018-01-18T21:13:47 <grrrero> I think the link is in there
2018-01-18T21:13:54 <grrrero> You just gotta "re-activate" it
2018-01-18T21:13:54 <grrrero> ?
2018-01-18T21:13:58 <grrrero> For the 512
2018-01-18T21:14:03 <grrrero> But yes we gotta document that
2018-01-18T21:14:15 <Justin_o> when i use those, it scales the one direction, but it doesn\'t have the proportional part
2018-01-18T21:14:22 <grrrero> Ok weird
2018-01-18T21:14:35 <Justin_o> but i just turned that on in my local settings and it persists
2018-01-18T21:14:38 <grrrero> So it was working when I first used it back last year
2018-01-18T21:14:44 <grrrero> And since then I\'ve only updated to 2018 Illustrator
2018-01-18T21:14:47 <grrrero> It might\'ve broken it
2018-01-18T21:14:52 <Justin_o> ah could be
2018-01-18T21:14:54 <grrrero> Because it\'s breaking for me too
2018-01-18T21:15:00 <grrrero> It should constrain proportions
2018-01-18T21:15:15 <grrrero> Did you fix up the actions to 512?
2018-01-18T21:15:31 <Justin_o> yes.. i changed the action to 512
2018-01-18T21:15:33 <grrrero> If you did can you send me what you have so we\'re working on the same file and I can try to restore the proportions thing
2018-01-18T21:17:14 <Justin_o> sent
2018-01-18T21:24:10 <grrrero> Justin_o: Sent back
2018-01-18T21:25:51 <Justin_o> thanks got it.. i tried, but it also doesn\'t seem to add the constraint.. if i had manually added the link it would be fine though
2018-01-18T21:25:57 <Justin_o> but it didn\'t seem to record that link
2018-01-18T21:26:02 <grrrero> Erghhhh
2018-01-18T21:26:08 <grrrero> That\'s annoying :\\
2018-01-18T21:26:11 <Justin_o> yah.. :(
2018-01-18T21:26:16 <grrrero> But it works for you when you use the link?
2018-01-18T21:26:19 <Justin_o> but i don\'t think it\'s hard to document so maybe not a big dieal
2018-01-18T21:26:22 <grrrero> Ok
2018-01-18T21:28:24 <grrrero> Yeah I noticed the interface changed from the 2017 version... it doesn\'t see that link when it records >_<

I want to move the uploader icon font to be generated with a build like i am doing for uio icons. I took the svgs for the uploader icons that jhung1 put into owncloud yesterday and moved them into the ai file and exported them.. however when i generate the font off of them some of the icons broken
2018-01-18T14:25:37 * jhung1 is now known as jhung_meeting
2018-01-18T14:25:41 <jhung_meeting> in a meeting Justin_o
2018-01-18T14:25:49 * clown joined the channel
2018-01-18T14:25:50 <grrrero> Justin_o: how are they broken?
2018-01-18T14:26:20 <sepidehshahi> justin\twhere can I find this icon? maybe I can recreate it and export again
2018-01-18T14:27:32 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: they are in here https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/apps/files/?dir=/IDRC-Design/Projects/Infusion/uploader&fileid=34984
2018-01-18T14:27:52 <Justin_o> i probably only need buttons 1 to 4
2018-01-18T14:28:19 <Justin_o> grrrero: so for example the one with the plus sign.. the plus is in the middle filled in and the circle is at the top left corner
2018-01-18T14:29:05 <Justin_o> grrrero: were there any particular settings that we need to use when exporting the icons?
2018-01-18T14:29:23 * gtirloni has quit
2018-01-18T14:29:53 <grrrero> Justin_o: I think I put them all in that sample Gruntfile
2018-01-18T14:30:05 <grrrero> Maybe you need to tweak it a bit

2018-01-18T14:30:47 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: also let  me know if you'd like to get all of the icons into our repo following your design guide, if so i'll scan through infusion to see if we have any more.. although other than uio and uploader the rest aren't using icon fonts.
2018-01-18T14:31:24 <Justin_o> grrrero: i mean when we export the artboard as an svg.. i get a dialog with some other options i can set
2018-01-18T14:31:36 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. please send me those and I\xe2\x80\x99ll add them to the repo
2018-01-18T14:31:42 <grrrero> Ohhhh
2018-01-18T14:31:54 <grrrero> Hmm
2018-01-18T14:32:15 <grrrero> Can I get back to you
2018-01-18T14:32:28 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks, i'll take a look around.... what's the best way for me to send to you.. web links, or e-mail you a zip file, or something else?
2018-01-18T14:32:32 <Justin_o> grrrero: sure
2018-01-18T14:33:16 <sepidehshahi> a zip file is easier for me Justin_o
2018-01-18T14:33:30 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: okay i'll collect the rest of them up and e-mail them to you
2018-01-18T14:34:13 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot! I\xe2\x80\x99m exporting the uploader icons.

2018-01-18T14:52:49 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: some of those icons were not pixel perfect so, I had to slightly change their size. maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why they were cutting off
2018-01-18T14:53:51 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks, i'll give them a try.. we should probably remove the colours at some but i should be able to test them as is

2018-01-18T15:20:45 <sepidehshahi> I did Justin_o. I removed the color. the sizes are slightly changed maybe a few decimals to make it to pixel. so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why they appear small\xe2\x80\xa6

2018-01-18T15:45:17 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: just try button 1 and 2. I re-created them
2018-01-18T15:47:49 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: so the circle and the symbol are still separated but the circle is at least in the a consistent corner now... so it is a little different
2018-01-18T15:48:05 <sepidehshahi> :D

2018-01-18T15:55:04 <Justin_o> i'll try button 1 again
2018-01-18T15:55:15 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks Justin_o
2018-01-18T15:56:54 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, jhung: tried the button again.. still has that problem and it's smaller again
2018-01-18T15:57:24 <jhung> fluid-everyone: Nintendo just announced a maker / hack / papercraft lab for the Nintendo Switch. https://youtu.be/P3Bd3HUMkyU
2018-01-18T15:57:29 <Justin_o> I have to run in a about 5 minutes, but i'll try to play around with the grunt-webfont configuration to see if there is something that we can change when it is compiling the font
2018-01-18T15:58:26 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-18T15:59:28 <jhung> Justin_o: when you're back, can you show me how you generate the fonts? I might want to experiment with different settings.
2018-01-18T16:00:35 <Justin_o> jhung: that's really cool.. i hope you can make your own things too
2018-01-18T16:00:57 <jhung> Justin_o: I'm wondering about that as well!
2018-01-18T16:01:01 <Justin_o> jhung: sure you can also look at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Standard+workflow+in+maintaining+and+creating+icon+fonts
2018-01-18T16:02:01 <Justin_o> jhung: and you can also look at the setup i have for the UIO icons https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6204/Gruntfile.js#L284-L338
2018-01-18T16:02:33 <Justin_o> you can pull down my FLUID-6204 branch.. it will include the updates to the package.json file to pull in the new dependencies as well
2018-01-18T16:02:40 <Justin_o> sorry have to run
2018-01-18T16:02:44 <jhung> thanks
2018-01-18T16:04:41 <sepidehshahi> jhung: this is amazing!!! thanks for sharing
2018-01-18T16:05:23 <Justin_o> jhung, sepidehshahi: it would be great to get these for the office..
2018-01-18T16:05:41 <jhung> it's an interesting and creative solution to avoid making plastic peripherals that was so popular with the Wii
2018-01-18T16:05:49 <sepidehshahi> absolutely!
2018-01-18T16:08:52 <sepidehshahi> grrrero: the artboards you have created for the infusion icon repo are 64x64. do you know if it is possible to increase their size to 65x65? the odd number helps with centering the icon.

2018-01-18T16:16:24 <danayo> jhung: Nintendo Labo looks really cool!
2018-01-18T16:18:52 <jhung> yeah. I really hope they open it up to allow hacking danayo. Right now it seems limited to using Nintendo kits, but hopefully they have plans to open it once they see success.
2018-01-18T16:21:29 <gtirloni> interesting project, related to the nintendo news: https://makecode.com/
2018-01-18T16:29:02 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Not able to join standup\xe2\x80\x94 yesterday worked on SNOW CSS tweaks and trying to retrieve a post at a time for the workshop panel. Today going to do more of that and help Justin_o with icons.

2018-01-18T18:17:01 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, grrrero, jhung: by the way i'm back from my appointment. Let me know if you need to chat about the icon stuff
2018-01-18T18:17:59 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. Not sure if I'll have time today to look much into the font generation.
2018-01-18T18:18:10 <Justin_o> ok
2018-01-18T18:19:31 <Justin_o> jhung: maybe i should just file a separate issue for now to generate the other icon fonts in infusion
2018-01-18T18:20:46 <jhung> sure Justin_o.
2018-01-18T18:21:10 <jhung> btw, I found the mockup for the Overview Panel, but it doesn't have the same icons Justin_o. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Branding?preview=%2F327842%2F38764578%2FFluidProject-ProjectsMockup.pdf

2018-01-18T18:30:26 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, i wonder if the icons came directly from icomoon
2018-01-18T18:31:17 <Justin_o> well maybe not, maybe the ones from the mockup are from icomoon https://icomoon.io/#preview-free
2018-01-18T18:33:15 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-18T19:01:58 <jhung> Oh, you know what Justin_o, you
2018-01-18T19:02:02 <jhung> 're probably right
2018-01-18T19:02:17 <grrrero> Justin_o: jhung and sepidehsahi and I were talking and I've experienced trouble with exporting to SVG in Illustrator -- it messes up the code somehow and I've never found a way to fix it. So we're thinking if you want to try to use an SVG optimiser like https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ ?
2018-01-18T19:02:42 <grrrero> Justin_o: Also sending out the Community Meeting email reminder in a bit if that's ok? I created the Meeting Notes for it in the wiki too
2018-01-18T19:03:13 <Justin_o> grrrero: regarding the community meeting stuff, sounds great..
2018-01-18T19:03:24 <Justin_o> grrrero: looking into the SVG optimiser
2018-01-18T19:04:19 * lliskovoi_ joined the channel
2018-01-18T19:04:19 <Justin_o> grrrero: interestingly when i made a recent svg i did use that optimizer, but it actually produced something that was larger than what i got out of illustrator
2018-01-18T19:04:24 * lliskovoi_ has quit
2018-01-18T19:05:53 <Justin_o> grrrero: i'll try running one of the icons that we were trying earlier through the optimizer and see if that changes anything
2018-01-18T19:06:13 <grrrero> Justin_o: Yeah let us know, and see if that fixes it which means there's something funky going on with Illustrator's SVG exporter
