2018-08-31T15:02:30 <Jess_> everyone: just noticed we have some glaring spelling errors on the ILDH: under perspectives we have Inclusive spelled wrong in 3 nav elements
2018-08-31T15:10:47 <michelled> jhung, Justin_o: I created a quick pull to fix the typos Jess_ mentioned but I can\'t seem to push it myself, can you? https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/pull/19
2018-08-31T15:10:56 <michelled> Jess_: let us know if you find more!
2018-08-31T15:11:52 <jhung> michelled, merged
2018-08-31T15:11:57 <michelled> thx jhung
2018-08-31T15:12:08 <Jess_> roger that
2018-08-31T15:12:39 <michelled> jhung: I can never remember - is it an automated process to update the site?
2018-08-31T15:13:17 <jhung> michelled: Yes it should be.
2018-08-31T15:20:08 <gtirloni> jhung michelled: it\'s automated but i see it wasn\'t triggered.. it\'s configured to use the gh-pages branch (https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/blob/a8afcbc02f4929da738e1b7b211592e266e34bf9/jenkins_jobs/website-handbook.floeproject.org.yml)
2018-08-31T15:20:16 <gtirloni> semi-automated
2018-08-31T15:20:38 <gtirloni> this still applies to this one: https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning#deploy-to-github-pages
2018-08-31T15:20:47 <michelled> ah! I just used the github interface to make the update
2018-08-31T15:20:51 <michelled> thanks gtirloni
2018-08-31T15:22:54 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m actually not sure what I need to do - when I look at the ghpages branch I only see a single commit
2018-08-31T15:23:02 <michelled> https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/commits/gh-pages
2018-08-31T15:25:07 <Justin_o> michelled: i believe you\'ll need to make a clean clone of master, run npm install, and then run the docpad deploy step. https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning#deploy-to-github-pages
2018-08-31T15:25:44 <Justin_o> that should push the necessary files to ghpages; which should get picked up by the automated step gtirloni mentioned
2018-08-31T15:28:36 <michelled> Justin_o: I think you or jon needs to do that - or you need to fix my perms
2018-08-31T15:28:42 <michelled> "ERROR: Permission to fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning.git denied to michelled.
2018-08-31T15:31:15 <michelled> I mean, perhaps my rushing and multitasking means I shouldn\'t have those perms ;)
2018-08-31T15:40:39 <Justin_o> michelled: i pushed up the changes https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/tree/gh-pages
2018-08-31T15:41:02 <Justin_o> it doesn\'t look like it\'s been redeployed yet to the site, hopefully that will happen soon
2018-08-31T15:41:27 <Justin_o> i\'m heading offline now, but we should talk about who can push to these later.. maybe next week.
2018-08-31T15:43:41 <gtirloni> alanharnum: we probably need to review all webhooks for these repositories and make sure they point to https://ci.incd.ca/github-webhook/  (with trailing "/" and all). i don\'t have access to do that in the fluid-project org though
2018-08-31T15:44:20 <gtirloni> michelled: triggered the deployment job manually, please see if the changes are there now -- https://ci.incd.ca/job/website-handbook.floeproject.org/15/
2018-08-31T15:44:35 <michelled> they are! thanks :)

2018-08-31T15:54:28 <alanharnum> gtirloni: yeah, in the short-medium term I\'d like to begin the process of converting the static sites to Docker containers
2018-08-31T15:54:56 <alanharnum> we\'ve got a whole bunch of different configs for the different static sites now and that\'s an opportunity both to containerize them and to standardize the process
2018-08-31T15:55:25 <alanharnum> plain nginx container if it\'s not from a generator, Hugo/DocPad builder container build step if it is (like we did for cities)
2018-08-31T15:56:14 <gtirloni> that sounds good

2018-08-31T18:14:11 <michelled> alanharnum or jhung, do either of you have a time to look at this? https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/72
2018-08-31T18:14:34 <michelled> jhung: sepidehshahi says she doesn\'t have anything
2018-08-31T18:14:39 <alanharnum> michelled: sure
2018-08-31T18:14:55 <jhung> Thanks michelled / sepidehshahi.
2018-08-31T18:16:30 <jhung> thanks for taking that alanharnum. I\'m trying to power through some PhET work.
