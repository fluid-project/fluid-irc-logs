b'2018-05-04T18:56:43 <Caren_> thanks gtirloni I was able to upload the image but unfortunately it isn\xe2\x80\x99t publishing\xe2\x80\xa6not sure if I might be missing a step.
2018-05-04T18:58:36 <gtirloni> Caren_: the article shows as published here https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/node/267
2018-05-04T18:59:26 <gtirloni> i\'m not sure how the editing works in drupal
2018-05-04T19:00:17 * colinclark has quit
2018-05-04T19:00:22 <Caren_> yes! gtirloni it\xe2\x80\x99s published but without the image I uploaded. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a crucial image I just wanted to include something visual with the words.
2018-05-04T19:00:23 <gtirloni> Caren_: maybe you upload it, then go back to the text and insert the image? although it asks you for the URL to the image (https://snow.idrc.ocadu.ca/sites/www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/files/Web%20home%20page%20of%20Outside_IN%20program.png) -- which is guaranteed to break if the website changes the URL in the future but... that\'s the weird part.
2018-05-04T19:00:40 <Caren_> Ah! gtirloni I will try that!
2018-05-04T19:06:51 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-04T19:10:56 <Caren_> no luck, gtirloni . Instering image is asking for a URL. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it for now. WP is around the corner and that will be easier I think. At least I\xe2\x80\x99m more familiar with WP than I am with Drupal. Thanks for your help!
2018-05-04T19:11:18 <gtirloni> ok, you\'re welcome
2018-05-04T19:23:16 <jessm> simonjb: alanharnum: you two might like to see this https://typatone.com/ -- one of our GSOC applicants sent it to me. It\'s kind of cool, you type and create music and then scroll down and it plays it like a song
2018-05-04T19:23:57 <jessm> it looks like this is the "main" app site http://patatap.com/
2018-05-04T19:27:24 <Caren_> gtirloni: sorry, I have another Drupal challenge :-(
2018-05-04T19:28:20 <Caren_> gtirloni: I\xe2\x80\x99ve published the article and promoted it to the home page but it\xe2\x80\x99s not showing up. I also added an event and it\xe2\x80\x99s not showing up on the home page calendar.
2018-05-04T19:29:05 <Caren_> Fingers crossed it\xe2\x80\x99s a flick of a switch that I\xe2\x80\x99m missing gtirloni
2018-05-04T19:33:57 <gtirloni> Caren_: I\'m not sure how to do that, sorry. Maybe Pat knows? I see she authored a lot of articles
2018-05-04T19:34:31 <gtirloni> "Sticky at top of lists" maybe? not sure
2018-05-04T19:35:04 <gtirloni> doesnt seem like it
2018-05-04T19:35:15 <Caren_> oh, good idea. Thanks gtirloni I will try that and connect with Pat.
2018-05-04T19:35:21 <gtirloni> cool
2018-05-04T19:51:06 <sepidehshahi> Hi colinclark: simonjb and I feel the proposal is in a good shape. It would be great If you could have a final look at it before sending it to Iris
2018-05-04T19:51:09 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2018-05-04T19:51:16 <colinclark> oh, that\'s great
2018-05-04T19:51:28 <colinclark> you\'re way ahead of me\xe2\x80\x94i\'m about halfway through writing this first post
2018-05-04T19:51:37 <colinclark> I\'ll take a look soon, too
2018-05-04T19:51:49 <colinclark> do you want to send a note to Jutta asking what she thinks of the new version?
2018-05-04T19:52:09 <sepidehshahi> sure
2018-05-04T19:52:25 <sepidehshahi> should we just remove the second proposal?
2018-05-04T19:53:24 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: ^
2018-05-04T19:54:38 <colinclark> might as well, or move it further down with a note saying that we won\'t propose this one

2018-05-04T17:41:59 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Hey! Not too bad. Gonna update the inclusive cities UIO and probably add those Twitter/FB cards that alanharnum was talking about yesterday
2018-05-04T17:42:06 <colinclark> sweet!
2018-05-04T17:42:17 <colinclark> There\'s one other thing I\'d like to do
2018-05-04T17:42:19 <colinclark> or actually two :)
2018-05-04T17:42:25 <neuralmilkhotel> Sure thing! colinclark
2018-05-04T17:42:30 <colinclark> Can we add a new "Ideas in Progress" section to the site?
2018-05-04T17:42:33 <colinclark> I will write the first post
2018-05-04T17:42:37 <neuralmilkhotel> Ooooh
2018-05-04T17:42:40 <neuralmilkhotel> Okay!
2018-05-04T17:42:45 <colinclark> I want to talk a little bit about how we were announced as being involved last night
2018-05-04T17:42:47 <colinclark> and what that means
2018-05-04T17:42:53 <colinclark> that we\'re still exploring potential collaborations
2018-05-04T17:43:04 <colinclark> that we\'ve been talking to our communities a lot about it
2018-05-04T17:43:10 <colinclark> and that will sort of set up our next few posts
2018-05-04T17:43:18 <neuralmilkhotel> Sounds good -- how would you like to add that section in the current layout?
2018-05-04T17:43:21 <colinclark> which will include the project proposal ideas that simonjb and sepidehshahi are currently working on
2018-05-04T17:43:34 <colinclark> neuralmilkhotel: I\'m happy to leave it up to you to decide
2018-05-04T17:43:56 <neuralmilkhotel> Okay \xce\xa3(\xef\xbe\x9f\xd0\x94\xef\xbe\x9f|||)
2018-05-04T17:44:05 <colinclark> if that\'s cool
2018-05-04T17:44:06 <neuralmilkhotel> Lemme think about it for a minute or two
2018-05-04T17:44:25 <neuralmilkhotel> Very cool, just gotta brainstorm it a bit :)
2018-05-04T17:44:40 <colinclark> the other thing I\'d like to do, but it\'s not as immediately important, is to start moving over to deploying the site via the inclusive-design Github org
2018-05-04T17:44:46 <colinclark> rather than from your fork
2018-05-04T17:44:47 <neuralmilkhotel> Right
2018-05-04T17:44:54 <colinclark> that might involve some help from gtirloni or alan
2018-05-04T17:44:58 <neuralmilkhotel> That makes sense 200%
2018-05-04T17:45:10 <colinclark> gtirloni: I think I was following your convention when I made this: https://github.com/inclusive-design/website-cities
2018-05-04T17:45:41 <gtirloni> yep, looks good!
2018-05-04T17:45:47 <neuralmilkhotel> Do you have the content ready colinclark ?
2018-05-04T17:45:48 <gtirloni> just let me know when the repo is ready, i can update CI
2018-05-04T17:45:51 <neuralmilkhotel> Or still writing it
2018-05-04T17:46:00 <colinclark> still imagining writing it :)
2018-05-04T17:46:10 <neuralmilkhotel> Haha ok :)
2018-05-04T17:46:15 <colinclark> i will have some lunch and then try to write it
2018-05-04T17:46:50 <neuralmilkhotel> Yes munching on ideas is always a good way to go about it
2018-05-04T17:48:12 <colinclark> :) :)
2018-05-04T17:48:45 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: I might try templating this stuff in Hugo over the weekend... just to get the process started and make things easier to update content
2018-05-04T17:48:51 <colinclark> makes sense
2018-05-04T17:50:17 <colinclark> gtirloni: will introducing Hugo complicate CI at all?
2018-05-04T17:50:36 <gtirloni> unlikely, it seems easier to work with than docpad
2018-05-04T17:50:49 <neuralmilkhotel> And where will the shell script (a la Alan\'s) go into play gtirloni ?
2018-05-04T17:50:49 <colinclark> you love Go :)
2018-05-04T17:50:53 <gtirloni> lol
2018-05-04T17:51:13 <michelled> jhung liked it better too
2018-05-04T17:51:17 <gtirloni> neuralmilkhotel: into CI
2018-05-04T17:51:45 <neuralmilkhotel> gtirloni: Will probably bug you on Monday to get it set up :)) I don\'t want to destroy things
2018-05-04T17:52:07 <gtirloni> no worries!
2018-05-04T17:53:33 <neuralmilkhotel> Thanks gtirloni!!
2018-05-04T17:53:55 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: do you have a working title for your post yet? Or I could just use some placeholder text
2018-05-04T17:57:00 <jhung> I really like Hugo. neuralmilkhotel feel free to ping me if you have any questions.
2018-05-04T17:57:13 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: Thanks jhung !
2018-05-04T17:57:18 <colinclark> neuralmilkhotel: Just use some placeholder for now
2018-05-04T17:57:25 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Ok!
2018-05-04T18:27:36 <Caren_> hi gtirloni I\xe2\x80\x99m uploading an article to the SNOW Drupal site and it won\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to include an image (it\xe2\x80\x99s a PNG and 706KB). I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there are naming conventions I should follow that might be blocking it? Not sure if you might have any experience with this issue\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-04T18:28:03 <gtirloni> hi Caren_: I\'m not aware of any conventions for that. Does it give you an error?
2018-05-04T18:28:36 <Caren_> gtirloni: it indicates File upload error. Could not move uploaded file.
2018-05-04T18:28:44 <gtirloni> ok, one sec
2018-05-04T18:32:46 <gtirloni> Caren_: please try again
2018-05-04T18:33:03 <Caren_> ok gtirloni I\xe2\x80\x99ll try now
2018-05-04T18:33:58 <Caren_> gtirloni: I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the same error message :-(
2018-05-04T18:34:25 <gtirloni> hmm nothing in the logs for me. which page are you editing?
2018-05-04T18:35:34 <neuralmilkhotel> Hi colinclark, sepidehshahi and I were talking about the layout/structure of the (first? initial?) Ideas in Progress page and it would look like a vertical timeline -- how does that sound to you?
2018-05-04T18:35:46 <colinclark> yup, that makes sense to me
2018-05-04T18:35:58 <Caren_> A new Article page I\xe2\x80\x99m attempting to publish. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s on the site, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not showing up on the home page Article feed window. It\xe2\x80\x99s titled: Inside Outside-IN: a free program tailored to the needs of individuals with invisible and episodic disabilities
2018-05-04T18:35:59 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok cool
2018-05-04T18:36:11 <Caren_> gtirloni: ^
2018-05-04T18:36:25 <gtirloni> Caren_: ok, thanks. i can reproduce the error
2018-05-04T18:36:34 * avtar has quit
2018-05-04T18:47:59 <gtirloni> Caren_: it should be okay now. it was a new security config that was restricting Drupal too much, sorry about that. the fix is now added to our config scripts
