2018-08-28T14:39:22 <gmoss> a bit technical
2018-08-28T14:39:39 <gmoss> "a bit" should be read as "very"
2018-08-28T14:42:42 <clown_mtg> the chrome caret browsing extension allows you to select and tab-navigate away and eventually to the "play" popup.
2018-08-28T14:50:11 <clown_mtg> Justin_o:  this might help:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iMlUOWf_u9kiSvnWfiulHYvoAPXVTdY5Kai9okNXWl4/edit?ts=5b1eea4e&pli=1
2018-08-28T14:51:28 <clown_mtg> although I do not see anything in there about text-to-speech

2018-08-28T15:24:18 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have a place where you leave notes from design crits. I\'m thinking of just writing up the content there and then linking to that on the wireframe page.
2018-08-28T15:26:31 <jhung> Justin_o: usually they\'re project related, so any notes to into those projects. A link would then get pasted into the design crit page.
2018-08-28T15:27:06 <Justin_o> ah okay.. so the other way around
