2018-08-24T14:23:38 <jhung> ping cindyli got an off-topic question for you, related to the past ATRC / IDRC employee list.
2018-08-24T14:23:57 <cindyli> ok, jhung
2018-08-24T14:24:41 <cindyli> what\'s about
2018-08-24T14:25:14 <jhung> back in the early Atutor days when Joel Kronenberg was the developer, there was also another developer on Atutor who helped out. She had short blonde hair, but I don\'t recall her name. You wouldn\'t happen to know her name, would you cindyli?
2018-08-24T14:30:43 <cindyli> umm\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t recall her. wonder if she worked on ATutor before or after Joel? when I joined ATRC, Joel had already left. I do remember i never met Joel, because Joel\'s name was everywhere in ATutor code ;) but don\'t rmb this lady
2018-08-24T14:30:49 <cindyli> jhung: ^
2018-08-24T14:31:38 <jhung> cindyli: thanks! I couldn\'t recall if you overlapped with Joel or not. :) I\'ll ask Heidi and see if she remembers. :)
2018-08-24T14:32:57 <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhung

2018-08-24T16:50:55 <carenwatkins_> Does anyone happen to have Google Analytics experience?
2018-08-24T16:51:38 <carenwatkins_> data analysis and formulation of other data from the analytics...
2018-08-24T16:51:53 <carenwatkins_> Geez, that sounds complicated...but I guess it can be :-)
2018-08-24T17:11:26 <gmoss> carenwatkins_: I have some experience using GA
2018-08-24T17:11:31 <gmoss> what\'s up? :)
2018-08-24T17:20:21 <carenwatkins_> I\'m wondering if it\'s possible to calculate an average number of hours users spent on the site. In theory I think the following formula works but when I started to read about page view data and time the data may not be as straight forward as might be expected. Here\'s what I was thinking: one geo-location/one year>unique page views x average time on pages divided by 52 weeks.
2018-08-24T17:36:06 <gmoss> carenwatkins_: it sounds possible, I\'m trying to think of a way to get the average session length for a particular time period
2018-08-24T17:36:22 <gmoss> I think average session duration is a field that\'s available
2018-08-24T17:38:29 <gmoss> under Audience > Overview, you can plot "Avg. Session Duration" and see it by month, then just tally those values over a one-year period and divide by 12
2018-08-24T17:38:33 <carenwatkins_> Is a session the same as average time on page I wonder
2018-08-24T17:38:57 <carenwatkins_> ah, ok, thanks gmoss !
2018-08-24T17:39:12 <gmoss> IIRC, a session is the user\'s interaction with all pages on the site that have GA running, from start to finish

2018-08-24T17:39:27 <gmoss> I hope it works! and you\'re very welcome, carenwatkins_ :)
2018-08-24T17:39:55 <gmoss> average time on page would be how long they\'ve spent on a particular page
2018-08-24T17:40:19 <gmoss> https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1006253?hl=en

2018-08-24T17:44:21 <carenwatkins_> I think there is also data that averages the time spent on all pages...but isn\'t that the same as average time users spend on the site. I think the data used for this report is coming at it differently. I\'m going to layer in the new calculations for this year!

2018-08-24T17:55:23 <gmoss> carenwatkins_: I\'m not sure if avg session length would be considered different from the total of the time spent on all pages and divided it by the total number of unique users. Am I correct in thinking that you\'re trying to get the average number of hours that an "average" unique user will have spent on the site over the course of one year? if so, that\'s different from what I\'ve suggested
2018-08-24T17:55:29 <gmoss> I think I\'m confusing myself haha
