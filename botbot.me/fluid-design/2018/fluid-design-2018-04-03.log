2018-04-03T15:14:27 <jhung> hi gtirloni, I pushed up a change to guide.inclusivedesign.ca but the deploy webhook didn\'t trigger. All I did was rename 2 files and I suspect that may not have been enough for the trigger.
2018-04-03T15:14:43 <gtirloni> let me check
2018-04-03T15:15:09 <jhung> thanks!
2018-04-03T15:23:40 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Vidyo\'s being stubborn and repeatedly kicking me out... :( Will keep trying but just in case: for SNOW: no news; Wordpress/wp-a11y-theme: finishing up the training manual; would like to sync up with jhung sometime this week to review the PR for FLOE-531
2018-04-03T15:24:35 <gtirloni> it kicked me out once too ("call ended" error)
2018-04-03T15:25:11 <grrrero> Yes :( gtirloni
2018-04-03T16:04:16 <c_watkins> Hi grrrero , jhung , michelled Would you have time to talk about questions I have about SNOW sometime this week?
2018-04-03T16:04:47 <grrrero> Sure c_watkins :) I\'m good except Thursday 3-4pm
2018-04-03T16:04:53 <grrrero> michelled and jhung ^

2018-04-03T16:05:54 <jhung> sure grrrero c_watkins. Tomorrow morning is open so far. Thursday works too. I\'m away Fri.
2018-04-03T16:08:36 <c_watkins> michelled: grrrero jhung : This afternoon or Thursday could work for me.
2018-04-03T16:09:10 <gtirloni> jhung: sorry for the delay, i just chcked the logs. we didn\'t get a notification from github when you pushed those changes. the jenkins integration in the repo\'s settings was shows a red icon... i just asked it to \'test service\' and it delivered the payload now (and jenkins triggered the build)
2018-04-03T16:09:24 <gtirloni> *was showing
2018-04-03T16:09:37 <michelled> c_watkins: 2:30 this afternoon works

2018-04-03T16:12:52 <gtirloni> jhung: it finished but there are some errors (more like warnings?). the deploy went through though -- https://ci.inclusivedesign.ca/job/website-guide.inclusivedesign.ca/32/console
2018-04-03T16:13:09 <c_watkins> michelled jhung grrrero: today at 2:30 it is. I will have to be invited to a vidyo room. Unfortunatley I continue to have connection problems.  :(
2018-04-03T16:13:56 <jhung> gtirloni: yes. Those warnings are fine (re: handlebars extension on md files with no handlebars markup inside).
