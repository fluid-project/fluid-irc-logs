2018-02-14T15:32:10 <Caren_> are you able to join grrrero?

2018-02-14T15:56:06 <grrrero> Hi jhung, Caren_ and michelled and I were wondering what\'s the process of deploying the dev site to production?
2018-02-14T15:56:13 <grrrero> (Also hope you\'re feeling better!)
2018-02-14T15:56:36 <grrrero> If Caren_ can keep uploading content to the dev site and at some point it\'ll go live?
2018-02-14T15:57:23 * avtar has quit
2018-02-14T16:00:25 <jhung> grrrero: the process depends on the site and the nature of the project. For example for BI, we started with an automated process, but abandoned it because of the risk of clobbering changes done in production.
2018-02-14T16:02:13 <jhung> give me a sec, writing up my process used on BI...
2018-02-14T16:02:57 <grrrero> jhung: Ok, thanks!!
2018-02-14T16:06:58 <jhung> Here\'s the process I\'ve been using for deploying changes. Note, the dev site doesn\'t deploy directly to production. The dev site is only for testing in a production environment since local and remote WP configurations can be different.
2018-02-14T16:06:59 <jhung> 1. Changes deployed to dev site and tested.
2018-02-14T16:06:59 <jhung> 2. On production site, put up a maintenance lock (Coming Soon Page & Maintenance Mode plugin by SeedProd).
2018-02-14T16:06:59 <jhung> 3. On production site, download copy of the theme currently in production.
2018-02-14T16:06:59 <jhung> 4. Consolidate any changes done in production by comparing production theme with new theme to upload (manual process using diff / Kdiff).
2018-02-14T16:06:59 <jhung> 5. Delete old theme in production, and upload the new theme.
2018-02-14T16:07:00 <jhung> 6. Test new theme in production.
2018-02-14T16:07:00 <jhung> 7. Fix any bugs. Repeat testing.
2018-02-14T16:07:01 <jhung> 8. Everything good? Remove maintenance lock.
2018-02-14T16:07:02 <jhung> ^ grrrero
2018-02-14T16:07:10 <jhung> I\'ll also put this onto the wiki.
2018-02-14T16:07:29 <grrrero> jhung: Thanks that\'s very helpful; cc: Caren_
2018-02-14T16:07:32 <grrrero> And michelled
2018-02-14T16:07:36 <jhung> ok
2018-02-14T16:07:39 <grrrero> ^ michelled Caren_
2018-02-14T16:08:38 <grrrero> With regards to content can we just do a backup of the WP content and re-upload to Prod WP? jhung Caren_
2018-02-14T16:08:48 <grrrero> *backup dev site WP content
2018-02-14T16:08:55 <grrrero> I know there are plugins that will do that
2018-02-14T16:09:51 <jhung> grrrero: since this is a "new" site going into production, you can just ask gtirloni to copy the dev site into production.
2018-02-14T16:10:06 <grrrero> jhung: Ahhh ok that makes it easier :)
2018-02-14T16:10:08 <jhung> *assuming the dev site is exactly how you want it.
2018-02-14T16:10:43 <michelled> ah, so Caren_ would just upload all the content she wants to the dev site
2018-02-14T16:10:50 <jhung> The 8-step process I outlined above is only for after it\'s been in production.
2018-02-14T16:10:54 <michelled> and we can test it out and play with it and then deploy it?
2018-02-14T16:11:06 <michelled> ah, ok. Caren_ does that make sense?
2018-02-14T16:11:20 <jhung> that makes sense michelled.
2018-02-14T16:11:40 <jhung> Basically get your dev site the way you want it, and gio can help copy it over.
2018-02-14T16:11:59 <jhung> After which, the maintenance cycle would be similar to the 8 steps I mentioned above.
2018-02-14T16:12:15 <jhung> *maintenance = theme maintenance.
2018-02-14T16:14:14 <Caren_> jhung: michelled Ok, I will upload content to the dev site knowing that it can be ported over to the site that will be depolyed live.
2018-02-14T16:14:58 <jhung> Caren_: awesome.
2018-02-14T16:15:06 <Caren_> thanks so much! jhung michelled grrrero
2018-02-14T16:15:27 <Caren_> the site looks amazing :-)
2018-02-14T16:16:41 <michelled> :)

2018-02-14T17:09:10 <danayo> sure Caren_
2018-02-14T17:09:25 <Caren_> can you call me on vidyo?

2018-02-14T18:58:01 <gmoss> danayo: an interesting thing happened - when i tried to grab the copy from that file and paste it into the project, the ligatures didn\'t convert properly into UTF-8, showing up as single unrecognized characters. i went down a brief rabbit hole reading about ligatures and web fonts, and css options relating to common/discretionary ligatures
2018-02-14T18:58:06 <gmoss> very neat stuff :)

2018-02-14T19:19:20 <grrrero> jhung: just me now!

2018-02-14T19:36:46 <danayo_> gmoss: could you drop me a link to latest storytelling tool implementation?
2018-02-14T19:38:18 <gmoss> danayo_: sure, one momentand I\'ll find it :) one caveat: it hasn\'t been changed in many months, so it\'s quite a bit behind the codebase, for the time being
2018-02-14T19:38:29 <gmoss> https://build.fluidproject.org/sjrk-storyTelling/
2018-02-14T19:38:32 <danayo_> thanks
2018-02-14T19:38:50 <gmoss> danayo_: no problem!
2018-02-14T19:39:00 <gmoss> I hope it\'s helpful :)
2018-02-14T19:39:19 <danayo_> gmoss: We were planning to show it today if we have a chance - mostly just to demostrate the excellent interface translation feature
2018-02-14T19:40:00 <danayo_> and probably the TTS as well
2018-02-14T19:40:06 <gmoss> danayo_: right, I think it will do the trick just fine, then. the Farsi page will likely be the most dramatic, since it shows off the right-to-left layout
2018-02-14T19:40:11 <danayo_> for sure
2018-02-14T19:40:23 <gmoss> the language of the story will dictate the language of the voice that reads the story, in Chrome anyway
2018-02-14T19:41:34 <danayo_> yes!
2018-02-14T19:41:40 <danayo_> I just realised that that is working - coo
2018-02-14T19:41:41 <danayo_> col
2018-02-14T19:41:43 <danayo_> cool!!

2018-02-14T19:56:34 <michelled> I\'m thinking I\'ll bring you in on vidyo on my machine and then you can screen share
2018-02-14T19:56:38 <michelled> does that seem ok?
2018-02-14T19:57:13 <grrrero> Hi jhung I\'ve set the new min-width to 64em, but it defaults to the parent theme\'s @media query for min-width 40em -- is there a way to override this?
2018-02-14T19:57:20 <grrrero> Does that make sense ?_?
2018-02-14T19:58:31 <danayo_> sure michelled
2018-02-14T19:59:09 <jhung> grrrero: first, is your new media query showing up in your inspector? I always check there first in case the browser is caching.
2018-02-14T20:00:54 <grrrero> Yep it\'s showing up jhung
2018-02-14T20:04:09 <gmoss> michelled danayo_ : Bert was suggesting to use the teleconferencing phones to connect audio remotely. I\'m not sure how that setup works, but I thought it worth mentioning. I hope it goes smoothly!
2018-02-14T20:04:31 <gmoss> *in the collab room
2018-02-14T20:05:01 <michelled> gmoss: my understanding was that jutta wanted the demos to be happening in this room - not the collab room
2018-02-14T20:05:13 <gmoss> michelled: gotcha! that simplifies things greatly
2018-02-14T20:05:58 <danayo_> michelled one sec I\'m on Vidyo on wrong machine
2018-02-14T20:06:46 <danayo_> ok
2018-02-14T20:06:51 <danayo_> ready now michelled
2018-02-14T20:06:53 <danayo_> sorry
2018-02-14T20:12:08 <gmoss> danayo_ michelled: also worth mentioning is that the text-to-speech available languages are rather limited, mostly only Western European languages and a few others such as Russian, Japanese and Chinese
2018-02-14T20:12:20 <gmoss> so Farsi won\'t work
