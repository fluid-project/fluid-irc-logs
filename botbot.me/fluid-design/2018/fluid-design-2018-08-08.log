2018-08-08T19:22:20 <Caren_> hello fluid-design folks: does anyone happen to know where the following broken link should be going (if the page exists elsewhere now)? it is a broken link on SNOW. https://adod.idrc.ocadu.ca/http:/adod.idrc.ocad.ca/
2018-08-08T19:26:29 <Caren_> scratch that! I just saw that the link was duplicated on the site. love simple fixes :-)
2018-08-08T19:27:48 <gmoss> Caren_: it looks like the URL is doubled up
2018-08-08T19:27:49 <gmoss> yeah
2018-08-08T19:28:03 <gmoss> I didn't see your second message ;)
2018-08-08T19:28:23 <gmoss> i'd keep the one with HTTPS rather than HTTP
2018-08-08T19:28:25 <Caren_> Thanks for checking gmoss :-)
2018-08-08T19:28:36 <Caren_> ah, ok. will do. thanks
