2018-06-26T19:25:47 <danayo> sepidehshahi, simonjb and others: a rather unconventional way of collecting personal fitness data (and beating the system)  http://www.tegabrain.com/Unfit-Bits http://www.unfitbits.com :D
2018-06-26T19:26:39 <sepidehshahi> :D that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing danayo!!!
2018-06-26T19:27:03 <simonjb> danayo: these are great :)
2018-06-26T19:27:13 <danayo> i love it
2018-06-26T19:27:18 <danayo> \xe2\x80\x9cfree your fitness from yourself"
2018-06-26T19:29:00 <simonjb> "Free your fitness. Free yourself. Earn Rewards." and who doesn\'t want to earn rewards?
2018-06-26T19:30:45 <danayo> :D
2018-06-26T19:33:17 <danayo> colinclark I think you would appreciate ^
2018-06-26T19:33:44 <danayo> more from Tega Brain: Eccentric engineering reimagines technologies to address their bias and scope. It is creative work that rethinks how we design and engineer and who is included and excluded in these processes. Eccentric engineering asks questions such as - how can we build systems that enact more-than-only-human agendas? How can we redesign infrastructures based on mutualism? How can technologies be repurposed to include more diverse agendas and
2018-06-26T19:33:44 <danayo> perspectives, particularly those of other life-forms and others who are not typically included?
2018-06-26T19:33:45 <danayo> How can we engineer with others?
2018-06-26T19:33:46 <danayo> Eccentric engineering describes atypical and out-of-centre engineering practices that shift how we assess success and failure in our systems and in doing so structure new forms of coexistence within and between human and non-human communities.
