2018-02-15T14:34:19 <vmorpheus> i would like to work for your organization this summer, and i have some ideas, however, no mentor is assigned to that idea yet. How should i get started?

2018-02-15T15:20:12 <simonjb> still not a lot of details on the features for programming your own thing but some discussion
2018-02-15T15:20:37 <simonjb> https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot-361-980x551.png
2018-02-15T15:20:59 <simonjb> looks like it\'ll be pretty interesting
2018-02-15T15:26:34 <jhung> simonjb: that\'s really cool. I really look forward to what consumers do with this.

2018-02-15T16:30:48 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: it looks like my choice in morning trains is poor and I\'ll miss the first few minutes of standup. Yesterday I made very good progress on adding alanharnum\'s dynamic view component grade into the storytelling tool, along with a block editor grade and template, much of this with michelled\'s help. I\'ll be working further on that today.

2018-02-15T16:51:22 <Caren_> my asynchronous standup report! continued on platform co-op content chuncking with the intention of leading to a workable concept for a visualization. This moring had to run my car to the shop for a tire fix (nail puncture). Continuing on PC and then moving to PhET to collab with jhung this afternoon.
2018-02-15T17:04:00 <vmorpheus> hi michelled, I am interested in this project "Inclusively Design & Build a Game for Kids".
2018-02-15T17:04:45 <vmorpheus> i have worked with game development for browsers, and am aware of the stack used. I prefer using the Phaser framework for this, and would further like to discuss my ideas on how to implement it
2018-02-15T17:06:47 <vmorpheus> could you please, suggest me on whom to contact? thank you.
2018-02-15T17:12:31 <grrrero> jhung: hey hey jhung, was doing some research and Foundation 6 sets the breakpoint for the topbar in setting.scss -- do you think this is something (or something in settings.scss) I have to change?
2018-02-15T17:25:28 <grrrero> Nevermind jhung it\'s all new in Foundation here https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/responsive-navigation.html
2018-02-15T17:25:47 <jhung> grrrero: We\'re using a CDN version of Foundation, so we don\'t have access to the SCSS source files.
2018-02-15T17:25:55 <grrrero> jhung: I see
2018-02-15T17:26:44 <grrrero> Do you think option is to set the row to wrap so that it mimics the hamburger menu? jhung
2018-02-15T17:26:50 <jhung> The way we would do it would be to override the Foundation style ourselves grrrero. This has been the approach we\'ve taken for most (all) our sites using Foundation - use Foundation as much as we can, override bits as necessary..
2018-02-15T17:27:05 <grrrero> jhung: Right
2018-02-15T17:27:27 <grrrero> jhung: So yeah, for 40em to 65.9999em we just do a flex row nowrap or something of the like?
2018-02-15T17:27:30 * danayo_ has quit
2018-02-15T17:27:40 <grrrero> So it won\'t be the hamburger menu but it will look like it
2018-02-15T17:28:11 <jhung> looking now grrrero
2018-02-15T17:28:39 <grrrero> Thanks jhung
2018-02-15T17:33:37 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-02-15T17:34:49 <jhung> grrrero: I did some looking, what we want is to be able to specify a custom "data-hide-for" value for the responsive toggle for those people aren\'t using the SASS / SCSS breakpoints: https://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/50488-custom-data-hide-for-widths
2018-02-15T17:35:41 <jhung> tl;dr - currently there\'s no way to specify a custom breakpoint for the mobile toggle unless you use the Foundation source.
2018-02-15T17:37:47 <jhung> Maybe there are other solutions grrrero? Perhaps taking the approach as mentioned yesterday with playing with the flexbox to have the items wrap / expand in a more appealing way between 40em and 66em?
2018-02-15T17:38:10 <grrrero> Yeah that\'s what I was thinking jhung
2018-02-15T17:38:33 <grrrero> Thanks for doing some digging
2018-02-15T17:41:05 <jhung> np grrrero
