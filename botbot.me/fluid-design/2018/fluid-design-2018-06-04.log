2018-06-04T15:58:53 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I was planning to step out at 1 - I could go now instead but might not make it back for 1 - maybe you should go ahead and I\xe2\x80\x99ll join you when I can?

2018-06-04T17:32:28 <danayo> sepidehshahi: are you still meeting?
2018-06-04T17:32:29 <avtar> jhung: i think we're opting to share updates in this channel now instead of using up crit time
2018-06-04T17:32:51 <sepidehshahi> danayo: we just finished
2018-06-04T17:32:58 <danayo> ok :( sorry
2018-06-04T17:33:06 <sepidehshahi> I can ask him to join a call and show you the prototypes quickly
2018-06-04T17:33:17 <sepidehshahi> let\xe2\x80\x99s have a quick chat with him
2018-06-04T17:33:29 <jhung> avtar: ok. That works.
2018-06-04T17:33:36 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi - whatever works best
2018-06-04T17:34:05 <jhung> fluid-everyone: does anyone have anything for tomorrow's design crit?
2018-06-04T17:34:37 <gmoss> jhung: I think I recall avtar mentioning the possibility of showing off the revised Inclusive Cities desings
2018-06-04T17:34:43 <gmoss> perhaps I misunderstood
2018-06-04T17:35:15 <jhung> gmoss: I was just talking to him about that above. They're going to use the channel instead.
2018-06-04T17:35:32 <gmoss> jhung: gotcha! I missed that
2018-06-04T17:35:36 <jhung> np
2018-06-04T17:38:30 <sepidehshahi> danayo: he will be ready to call in 5 minutes
2018-06-04T17:39:56 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi
2018-06-04T17:46:24 <sepidehshahi> danayo: we are on Skype
2018-06-04T17:46:32 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to add you to the call

2018-06-04T19:21:20 <danayo> michelled: I am going to create a wiki page and put some of my notes / ideas there from our trip - do you want to meet tomorrow afternoon to talk it through?
2018-06-04T19:27:18 <michelled> yes!
2018-06-04T19:27:27 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-06-04T19:29:00 <jhung> danayo and michelled - I was wondering if either of you would like to share about your recent trip in a future design crit or community workshop?
2018-06-04T19:33:51 <danayo> jhung, michelled: I can\xe2\x80\x99t decide whether a community meeting or crit makes more sense, and maybe it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Perhaps we could do it at next week\xe2\x80\x99s crit?
2018-06-04T19:34:45 <danayo> looks like june is pretty booked for community meetings anyway, so the crit would allow us to do it while it\xe2\x80\x99s still somewhat fresh in our minds
2018-06-04T19:35:12 <michelled> that would be great
2018-06-04T19:41:02 <sepidehshahi> danayo: here is the pull request for the Privacy entery: https://github.com/fluid-project/docs-inclusive-learning/pull/15
2018-06-04T19:41:19 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2018-06-04T19:41:27 <sepidehshahi> thank you
2018-06-04T19:43:14 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: do you have any time today to talk briefly about Sidewalk?

2018-06-04T20:19:33 <danayo> by the way alanharnum - I think this is the most recent versin of the cuentalo site http://cuentalo.org/
2018-06-04T20:20:07 <danayo> and if you go to Historias and then Registrar una historia, and create an account, you can see the story gathering tool they\xe2\x80\x99ve put together

2018-06-04T20:21:39 <danayo> gmoss ^
2018-06-04T20:22:23 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss: I\xe2\x80\x99m so sure Silvia showed us an Environmental Guardians website recently, but now I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find it
2018-06-04T20:23:15 <gmoss> danayo: I don't recall seeing such a site, which is not to suggest it doesn't exist. I only remember seeing photos during her presentation here in October.
2018-06-04T20:23:27 <danayo> perhaps I dreamt it gmoss :p
2018-06-04T20:23:30 <gmoss> perhaps there's a link in some notes from one of our meetings
2018-06-04T20:23:43 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep looking gmoss
2018-06-04T20:23:46 * gtirloni has quit
2018-06-04T20:23:59 <gmoss> danayo: good luck! I do remember seeing the YouTube channel with people telling their stories, if that helps
2018-06-04T20:27:38 <gmoss> danayo: the Cuentalo story form is pretty neat! I like that they have YouTube integration
