2018-03-02T17:38:18 <jhung> @clown got an a11y question for you.
2018-03-02T17:46:44 <jhung> maybe this is a lliskovoi question\xe2\x80\xa6 but do you know how <i> <em> and strong and <b> elements are handled by screen readers?

2018-03-02T19:31:02 <alanharnum> michelled1: we can use my Vidyo room, but let\'s give it 10 minutes or so? gmoss isn\'t back yet, think he may have run for a coffee

2018-03-02T19:35:08 <gmoss> alanharnum michelled1 sorry to keep you waiting, I had to take care of a couple of things. I\'m good for 2:40
2018-03-02T19:37:09 <jhung> colinclark: you got a shoutout at the sonification meeting. :) Mike Winters was saying how he\'s using your OSC bridge to make quick demos and video recordings.
2018-03-02T19:39:13 <clown> jhung, I was at the union meeting from just after standup.  I just got back.  So\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-03-02T19:39:54 <gmoss> alanharnum michelled1 I\'ve unlocked my room
2018-03-02T19:40:19 <clown> I would have to look up  how <i>, <em>, etc. are represented in the a11y tree \xe2\x80\x94 it wouldn\'t take long.
2018-03-02T19:40:36 <jhung> no worries clown. We were able to resolve it. PhET folks were thinking of using <i> elements as a selector but now going to use classname as a selector on <span> instead.
2018-03-02T19:40:50 <clown> But, I don\'t know what a screen reader does with that information \xe2\x80\x94 how it renders things audibly.
2018-03-02T19:41:23 <jhung> clown: yes that was my concern. To me span was more neutral and a more sensible way of doing selections than using <i>
2018-03-02T19:41:26 <clown> much better.  they could also use a selector based on a role, if that\'s applicable, or even an aria-* attribute.
2018-03-02T19:41:43 <gmoss> jhung clown: a quick tangent, but I thought <i> and <b> were deprecated, is that not the case?
2018-03-02T19:42:00 <jhung> gmoss: it isn\'t. :)
2018-03-02T19:42:06 <jhung> Let me find you a link gmoss
2018-03-02T19:42:29 <jhung> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em
2018-03-02T19:42:30 <clown> gmoss, I actually don\'t remember.  I know it\'s strongly advised to use semantic markeup (em, strong) instead of formatting markup (i, b).
2018-03-02T19:43:08 <jhung> <i> is still used for formatting. <em> is for actual emphasis, even though they\'re both visually the same.
2018-03-02T19:44:12 <gmoss> jhung: ah i see, I must have conflated the encouragement of semantic markup with actual deprecation
2018-03-02T19:44:24 <jhung> yeah. same here gmoss.
2018-03-02T19:44:50 <gmoss> but I see how <i> carries semantic meaning of its own, separate from <em>
2018-03-02T19:44:54 <gmoss> as detailed in the link
2018-03-02T19:46:19 <jhung> yeah. Now I won\'t immediately change every <i> without checking its context first. :)
2018-03-02T19:46:58 <clown> for the record, the a11y mapping for em is not semantic at all.  It\'s mapped to a style:  https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#el-em  (I wonder why\xe2\x80\xa6)
2018-03-02T19:47:21 <clown> the same with strong.
2018-03-02T19:47:29 <clown> https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#el-strong
2018-03-02T19:48:32 <clown> So, it looks like using em and strong semantically is lost at the level of the a11y tree.  Hence, don\'t use them.  The decision you and the PHeT people made, jhung, was correct.
2018-03-02T19:49:26 <colinclark> jhung: Wow, that\'s really incredible!
2018-03-02T19:49:29 <colinclark> I\'m glad it was useful
2018-03-02T19:49:42 <colinclark> if only I had enough time to build the actual Sonification Toolkit
2018-03-02T19:49:47 <colinclark> ...one of these days
2018-03-02T19:51:53 <jhung> thanks clown
2018-03-02T19:53:14 <jhung> colinclark: yeah. It was awesome to hear him say that. Glad it\'s useful. He\'s going to help make some sonification prototypes for Faraday\'s Law.
2018-03-02T19:53:29 <colinclark> awesome, i can\'t wait to hear it
2018-03-02T19:53:39 <colinclark> you\'ve been doing some sound design for it, jhung?
2018-03-02T19:54:36 <jhung> a little colinclark \xe2\x80\xa6 with my limited ability with Audacity. :)
2018-03-02T19:54:48 <jhung> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Faraday%27s+Law+-+Sonification+Sketches
2018-03-02T19:54:51 <jhung> ^ colinclark
2018-03-02T19:54:53 <colinclark> awesome :)
2018-03-02T19:56:23 <colinclark> jhung: For the negative to positive example, did you reverse the sound?
2018-03-02T19:56:55 <jhung> colinclark: no, I just did a pitch shift on it.
2018-03-02T19:57:12 <colinclark> interesting
2018-03-02T19:57:16 <colinclark> it works quite well
2018-03-02T19:57:26 <jhung> colinclark: reversing for positive / negative could make sense too.
2018-03-02T19:59:24 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel
2018-03-02T19:59:40 <jhung> colinclark: In the sonification meeting I showed Faraday\'s law and we talked about possible design ideas. I did not share my design as I was interested in seeing what the folks from gatech would say. Mike at the end arrived at a very similar sound design as my sketches\xe2\x80\xa6 but with words I don\'t fully understand.
2018-03-02T20:00:02 <colinclark> ha
2018-03-02T20:00:07 <colinclark> anything i can help translate?
2018-03-02T20:02:12 <jhung> I don\'t fully understand what is meant by timbre colinclark.
2018-03-02T20:02:35 <colinclark> ah, yes, it\'s a funny kind of thing
2018-03-02T20:02:41 <colinclark> the "colour" of a sound
2018-03-02T20:02:58 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-03-02T20:03:05 <colinclark> so timbres can be "rough" or "clear" or "smooth"
2018-03-02T20:03:08 <colinclark> complex or simple
2018-03-02T20:03:28 <jhung> Ah.
2018-03-02T20:03:39 <colinclark> timbre is related to the harmonics of a sound\xe2\x80\x94so how many different sounds are "inside" the side, and how much that changes over time
2018-03-02T20:03:56 <colinclark> so if you make a sine wave at a particular pitch in Audacity, you\'ll see and hear that it\'s very smooth
2018-03-02T20:04:03 <colinclark> a sinewave is as simple a timbre as you can get
2018-03-02T20:04:07 <colinclark> because there\'s just one harmonic there
2018-03-02T20:04:19 <colinclark> whereas a drum or a bell will have a very rich timbre
2018-03-02T20:04:41 <colinclark> because there are lots of different harmonics, and they\'re often in less integral relationships with each other
2018-03-02T20:05:42 <colinclark> A flute is a lot like a sine wave
2018-03-02T20:07:56 <jhung> Interesting.
2018-03-02T20:08:08 <colinclark> this video is pretty good for a super-quick overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMNYOaP7NXA
2018-03-02T20:08:36 <jhung> Awesome. Thanks colinclark. It\'s a whole other world. Like a Trekkie walking into a Firefly convention.
2018-03-02T20:08:42 <colinclark> hahaha
2018-03-02T20:08:54 <colinclark> that\'s a great analogy
2018-03-02T20:09:12 <jhung> haha I\'ll try to use that sparingly.
