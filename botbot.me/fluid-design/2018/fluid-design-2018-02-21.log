2018-02-21T16:15:27 <grrrero> Hi jhung and alanharnum  would you be able to talk about Wheelmaps integration into Big IDea on March 7?
2018-02-21T16:15:38 <grrrero> ^ for community meeting
2018-02-21T16:15:55 <alanharnum> grrrero: hey, that works for me if it does for jhung
2018-02-21T16:16:18 <jhung> checking now grrrero, alanharnum\\
2018-02-21T16:18:29 <jhung> That works for me grrrero, alanharnum, but I wonder if there\'s enough to talk about there. We\'ve pretty much decided on the scope and just waiting for "approval" from the leads.
2018-02-21T16:19:36 <alanharnum> jhung: what I was thinking is that I\'d talk generally about what I found out from the investigation spike, and about some of the longer-term possibilities of working with third-party services like Wheelmap and accessibility.cloud
2018-02-21T16:20:05 <alanharnum> & you could discuss the design / Big IDea side
2018-02-21T16:20:07 <jhung> ok that sounds good alanharnum.
2018-02-21T16:21:49 <grrrero> jhung alanharnum awesome thanks
2018-02-21T16:22:13 <grrrero> I\'ll pencil you in for March 7th :) alanharnum jhung
2018-02-21T16:22:26 <jhung> Thanks grrrero
2018-02-21T16:23:32 <grrrero> Thank you jhung and alanharnum :)
2018-02-21T16:25:26 <jhung> fluid-everyone - does anyone have anything for next week\'s design crit? I was thinking of showing off Wordpress\' new Gutenberg content editor if there wasn\'t anything.
2018-02-21T16:25:37 <jhung> * I will ask again later in the week.
2018-02-21T16:25:43 <grrrero> Oh that\'s awesome jhung

2018-02-21T19:29:15 <jhung> gtirloni: I was wondering if it\'s possible to increase the upload size for Wordpress to something larger? Our theme files are getting larger. 10MB for now should be sufficient.
2018-02-21T19:30:43 <gtirloni> jhung: yep, for sure. which websites?
2018-02-21T19:31:07 <jhung> Big Idea and Our Doors are Open gtirloni.
