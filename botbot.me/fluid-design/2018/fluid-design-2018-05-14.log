2018-05-14T15:46:38 <danayo> Justin_o: are you referring to Mike\xe2\x80\x99s questions about who the UIO testing was done with?
2018-05-14T15:47:28 <Justin_o> yes, and i think he also had one about plans for future testing

2018-05-14T15:48:26 <danayo> re: the first question Justin_o - I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the testing but I can dig to see what I can find out (maybe not this week though)
2018-05-14T15:48:40 <danayo> re: the second question - it\xe2\x80\x99s a good one :)
2018-05-14T15:49:42 <Justin_o> :) thanks... i\'m not sure urgent he needs a reply, so i think we can wait till you\'re back. If not I\'ll just let him know that you\'re away and we\'ll follow up later.

2018-05-14T17:40:27 <michelled> neuralmilkhotel, sepidehshahi, colinclark: I was just looking at the inclusive cites site and I wondered if it might be better for the time line to go in the other direction so the most recent stuff is at the top
2018-05-14T17:40:54 <neuralmilkhotel> michelled: Makes sense to me
2018-05-14T17:41:17 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good point michelled

2018-05-14T17:46:38 <neuralmilkhotel> michelled, sepidehshahi, colinclark As more posts come along though I think we\'d have to move the older ones somewhere else or in an archive, and just post the most recent 5 (?) "ideas" on the homepage.
2018-05-14T17:47:03 <neuralmilkhotel> Thoughts? ^
2018-05-14T17:47:33 * alanharnum has quit
2018-05-14T17:50:00 <sepidehshahi> I agree. I think we can have a separate page for \xe2\x80\x98Ideas in progress\xe2\x80\x99. You would be able to navigate to that page with a tab on the landing page. The top 3-5 posts will be displayed on the landing page as well

2018-05-14T19:09:44 <neuralmilkhotel> michelled: Here\'s the PR that jhung merged a while back for wp-a11y-theme https://github.com/jhung/wp-a11y-theme/pull/3#event-1581724005
2018-05-14T19:09:56 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: Are we moving foundation branch now to master?

2018-05-14T19:25:14 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-05-14T19:25:29 <jhung> The only outstanding PR is the widgitized front panels, but that PR is a bit stale now. I think it should be closed and a new PR issued for that.
2018-05-14T19:26:38 <neuralmilkhotel> jhung: Sure let me merge the latest from the foundation branch first and then see if I\'ve broken anything with the widgets :)
2018-05-14T19:27:23 <jhung> will do. I\'ll merge Foundation into Master and then transfer ownership to the Inclusive Design org.
