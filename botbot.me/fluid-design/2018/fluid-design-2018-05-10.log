2018-05-10T19:49:55 <carenwatkins> neuralmilkhotel: can I ask you a quesiton about posting content on the SNOW dev site?
2018-05-10T19:50:49 <neuralmilkhotel> Sure carenwatkins
2018-05-10T19:54:25 <carenwatkins> How do I post content on a second level landing page, Accessibility and Tech for example? It seems to be different from the 3rd level, such as Alt keyboards, alt mouse, for example. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m approaching it incorrectly\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-10T19:54:33 <carenwatkins> neuralmilkhotel: ^
2018-05-10T20:12:26 <michelled1> danayo: did you put the Karisma theme designs somewhere? Or is it what you sent us?
2018-05-10T20:13:29 <michelled1> danayo_: ^
2018-05-10T20:13:32 <danayo_> you mean the pdf they sent us michelled1 ?
2018-05-10T20:13:47 <michelled1> no, I mean your design for the storytelling tool
2018-05-10T20:13:49 <danayo_> i sent you owncloud links to the mockups and assets
2018-05-10T20:14:06 <michelled1> ah, ok, great - I'll use those
2018-05-10T20:14:15 <michelled1> danayo: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/HuoRZjHnj0DiJoW#pdfviewer
2018-05-10T20:14:17 <michelled1> right?
2018-05-10T20:15:26 <danayo_> yes michelled1  that's the one - Daniela responded with a couple of minor translation edits so I'll fix those
2018-05-10T20:16:08 <michelled1> oh great!

2018-05-10T14:14:59 <jhung> sepidehshahi, lliskovoi, or carenwatkins: do either of you have time to take a quick look at a DEEP 2018 logo concept?
2018-05-10T14:15:19 <lliskovoi> sure jhung!
2018-05-10T14:15:46 <jhung> You can find it in OwnCloud > IDRC-Designs > Events > Deep > Deep-logo.ai
2018-05-10T14:16:03 <sepidehshahi> for sure jhung, I have a meeting in a few minutes but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to look at it afterwards
2018-05-10T14:16:12 <jhung> The idea is be festive\xe2\x80\xa6 it's Deep's birthday.
2018-05-10T14:16:21 <jhung> Hence the birthday cake colours\xe2\x80\xa6 and confetti.
2018-05-10T14:16:35 <jhung> I should stop before I put a candle on the logo....
2018-05-10T14:16:37 <jhung> and a hat
2018-05-10T14:17:20 <sepidehshahi> :D
2018-05-10T14:17:41 <sepidehshahi> jhung: what is the color scheme for the DEEP site this year?
2018-05-10T14:18:05 <sepidehshahi> is it also festive or just the logo?
2018-05-10T14:18:35 <jhung> sepidehshahi: we're trying to be festive-ish. :D
2018-05-10T14:18:56 <jhung> I'm not doing a great job selling this. jessm is much more festive than me.

2018-05-10T14:23:54 <lliskovoi> jhung: yay festive! looks fun :) A couple of suggestions to try out: 1) take out the stroke around the speech bubble, 2) play around with the placement of the confetti (it's a bit close to the edge, I would either put it farther away from the edge or make it pop out of the bubble on purpose so it goes over the edges, this might be a more playful/festive approach), 3) try a different font on the year, since
2018-05-10T14:23:54 <lliskovoi> year is a big festive anniversary one, I would make the font a bit more playful, maybe try lowercase oldstyle numerals
2018-05-10T14:26:36 <carenwatkins> hi jhung lliskovoi sepidehshahi ! great ideas re: Deep logo. Another thought: keep logo as is and layer pyrotechnics coming from the middle\xe2\x80\xa6could animate in some instances.
2018-05-10T14:27:25 <jhung> carenwatkins: what's a birthday without some pyrotechnics, right? :D
2018-05-10T14:27:44 <jessm> omg <love> these ideas!
2018-05-10T14:27:56 <jhung> Thanks for the comments lliskovoi and carenwatkins. I'll come back to this later today.
2018-05-10T14:28:07 <carenwatkins> :D
2018-05-10T14:28:20 <carenwatkins> kaboom
2018-05-10T14:29:00 <jessm> everyone try to remember what you did for your 25th birthday because that's what we are! the IDRC nee ATRC is 25 this year -- that's the reason for the party!
2018-05-10T14:31:36 <lliskovoi> jessm: ooooo I like this game
2018-05-10T14:33:02 <carenwatkins> perhaps we should consider what is being celebrated. when I think of celebrating someones birthday it becomes a time to refelct on what that person means to me, the community, family, etc.
2018-05-10T14:48:10 <carenwatkins> hi neuralmilkhotel Was thinking about content upload process in theory. Was thinking I could \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d with edited content I have in google docs. Is it ok to upload some content to the SNOW dev site at this point?

2018-05-10T15:05:34 <gmoss> jessm: it was my champagne birthday (as well as my brother's), so my friends and I got together and had a little party at a bar. Naturally, we drank prairie fires ;) I think the main takeaway is how we surrounded ourselves with those we cared about and shared the moment together.
2018-05-10T15:06:08 <gmoss> maybe there's a retrospective angle there, or community building
2018-05-10T15:06:28 <jessm> cool -- yes, i'm thinking a past, present, and future -- not just about content or topics, but of community too
2018-05-10T15:06:53 <jessm> we'll have folks who have been there the whole 25 years and we want to bring people for whom this is their first DEEP!

2018-05-10T15:51:51 <jessm> lliskovoi: love that you're working with hypothesis -- would love to hear about it
2018-05-10T15:51:58 <jhung> How about an inclusive cake hackathon on Friday? and we all eat them Saturday?

2018-05-10T15:52:35 <jessm> jhung: OMG, co-designing cakes?! JT wanted to do something co-design-y and possibly something related to inclusive cities on Friday -- something participatory
2018-05-10T15:52:46 <jhung> There you go! :D
2018-05-10T15:52:57 <jhung> A city of cakes.
2018-05-10T15:52:58 <jessm> lliskovoi: i'd love to be filled in and then have a chat about H5P too! next week maybe? Wed or Thurs i'll be in
2018-05-10T15:53:21 <jessm> jhung: a great IDRC bake-a-thon
2018-05-10T15:53:21 <carenwatkins> lliskovoi: sepidehshahi jhung everyone What if the Deep25 logo was an exploration of a multimodal logo/wordmark?
2018-05-10T15:53:35 <jessm> great idea carenwatkins !
2018-05-10T15:53:42 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99d love that carenwatkins
2018-05-10T15:53:48 <colinclark> hey IDRC twitterers, we recently posted this piece to the Inclusive Cities website: https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/ideas/for-an-inclusive-quayside/
2018-05-10T15:53:53 <colinclark> it'd be really great to get word out about it
2018-05-10T15:54:15 <jessm> danayo_: also... i'd love to get you into Slack so you can chit chat with the GSOCers more
2018-05-10T15:54:16 <lliskovoi> jessm: perfect, I'll have the WCAG report and at least some of the flow-based write up done by then. What time is good for you on Wednesday?
2018-05-10T15:54:24 <lliskovoi> carenwatkins: that would be amazing!
2018-05-10T15:54:34 <danayo_> yeah sorry jessm I am not in the Slack habit
2018-05-10T15:54:39 <jessm> danayo_: one issue is time zones -- they're usually there in the a.m. which might not be great for you, but Slack is accommodating like that
2018-05-10T15:54:46 <danayo_> yeah
2018-05-10T15:55:01 <colinclark> I posted this if you need an easy retweet: https://twitter.com/colinbdclark/status/993987270687494146

Today I'm going to continue on with that work.
2018-05-10T16:43:02 <colinclark> neuralmilkhotel: Let's chat with michelled this aft about priorities and next steps for that
2018-05-10T16:43:11 <colinclark> We're going to have a new post we'll need to get up to the site
2018-05-10T16:43:18 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Okay
2018-05-10T16:43:29 <colinclark> and if Hugo's still taking some work, I'm thinking we could postpone it for a bit and work on some other things first
2018-05-10T16:43:56 <michelled> sounds good - is there a good time to meet?
2018-05-10T16:44:10 <neuralmilkhotel> michelled colinclark I'm good anytime
