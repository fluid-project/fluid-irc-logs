b'2018-01-04T20:19:01 <grrrero> Oh ok!
2018-01-04T20:19:01 <danayo> it\'s sycing verrrrry slowly
2018-01-04T20:19:23 <colinclark> I like the two column layout too
2018-01-04T20:19:33 <colinclark> especially when it can collapse to one responsively :)
2018-01-04T20:19:44 <danayo> definitely colinclark!
2018-01-04T20:19:59 <colinclark> this is a great list of resources, danayo
2018-01-04T20:20:03 <colinclark> nice descriptions
2018-01-04T20:20:14 <danayo> grrrero, you\'ll see I moved the feedback line to the top and removed the other one - it was redundant and confusing
2018-01-04T20:20:18 <danayo> thanks colinclark
2018-01-04T20:21:23 <grrrero> Yeah that was a good call danayo :)
2018-01-04T20:22:23 <danayo> grrrero: there are a couple of other things - 2 links I\'d like to update - I\'ll comment in the JIRA and add the attachment to
2018-01-04T20:22:25 <danayo> *too
2018-01-04T20:22:55 <danayo> also grrrero - I\'d like to bring the nav text in somewhat - so that it\'s not spaced out across the full width
2018-01-04T20:23:03 <danayo> I think I should create a separate JIRA, yes?
2018-01-04T20:23:41 <danayo> that\'s not critical for next week of course
2018-01-04T20:24:02 <grrrero> Yep for sure
2018-01-04T20:24:57 <danayo> grrrero: if you re-open the link the latest file should be there
2018-01-04T20:25:22 <danayo> I\'ve made some edits from the Google doc version, so I\'ll delete that from the JIRA
2018-01-04T20:26:08 <danayo> or, actually grrrero - it would probably be easier for you if I update the good doc, right? so you can copy and past text
2018-01-04T20:26:26 <grrrero> Yeah I can do that :)
2018-01-04T20:26:36 <grrrero> What latest file should I be looking out for?
2018-01-04T20:35:08 <danayo> grrrero: the owncloud link in the JIRA is the latest
2018-01-04T20:35:15 <danayo> and I updated the google doc text too
2018-01-04T20:36:12 <grrrero> danayo: Ok sounds good! Checking it out now
2018-01-04T20:42:10 <danayo> grrrero: just need to grab some food and will be back shortly

2018-01-04T21:31:56 <gmoss> danayo: sorry, simonjb and I were in the zone coding. I second everyone else\'s thoughts :) I think the single-column layout might be better with a bit more breathing room for the major headers, but I still prefer the two-column layout and it can fall back to one for smaller screens
2018-01-04T21:33:11 <gmoss> *"breathing room" = spacing above the header. "major headers" = \'selected links\' and \'tool development in progress\'
2018-01-04T21:33:39 <simonjb> Caren_: sorry, was away from my computer, I have a digital multimeter which could measure voltage
2018-01-04T21:34:01 <simonjb> but no bar magnets
2018-01-04T21:34:32 <simonjb> I don\'t have an analog voltmeter with a needle
2018-01-04T21:39:52 <simonjb> Caren_: looks like you\'d need an ammeter rather that a voltmeter I think (I don\'t have an analog ammeter either)
2018-01-04T21:40:07 <simonjb> but my digital multimeter will read current

2018-01-04T14:56:54 <sepidehshahi> Good morning Justin_o: for UIO icons do you need high contrast/ black and white assets or just the colored ones?
2018-01-04T14:59:37 <Justin_o> hmm... maybe just the coloured ones, unless we want it to be monochrome all the time
2018-01-04T14:59:41 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: ^
2018-01-04T15:01:39 <sepidehshahi> sure Justin_o. based on the examples you have shared, monochrome does not work very well with the icon that has the half gear behind the person, but it looks ok for the other one (the person who is hugging the gear)

2018-01-04T16:13:28 <sepidehshahi> Also I have added a white or light grey background to make sure they stand up on different screen themes. Please have a look and let me know your thoughts Justin_o

2018-01-04T18:30:40 <grrrero> ok cool cool
2018-01-04T18:40:21 <danayo> grrrero: getting there! I haven\'t created a JIRA yet - did you? could you? and then I\'ll link to the file from there
2018-01-04T18:40:29 <grrrero> Sure thing danayo!
2018-01-04T18:40:37 <danayo> thanks!
2018-01-04T18:42:45 <grrrero> danayo here you go https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-47?orderby=created+DESC%2C+priority+ASC%2C+updated+DESC
2018-01-04T18:42:54 <danayo> awesome
2018-01-04T18:44:54 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: sorry, just had a chance to look over the UIO+ icons. I\'ve attached new screenshots to https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2745
2018-01-04T18:45:05 <Justin_o> I\'m not sure which one I like better. Do you have a preference?
2018-01-04T18:48:16 <sepidehshahi> Thanks Justin_o, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really tell\xe2\x80\xa6 I prefere the ones with white background
2018-01-04T18:48:39 <sepidehshahi> danayo could you please have a look at the last four screenshots and see if you have a preference? ^
2018-01-04T18:49:10 <danayo> I was just looking at them sepidehshahi :) only the last four?
2018-01-04T18:49:26 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo, those are the updated ones
2018-01-04T18:49:36 <sepidehshahi> and thanks :)
2018-01-04T18:49:49 <danayo> ah ok, I prefer the last one (I think it also looks good in all black)
2018-01-04T18:49:56 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2018-01-04T18:50:29 <danayo> I like the gear behind more than the hug (though I like hugs :)
2018-01-04T18:50:50 <sepidehshahi> danayo: please also see the integration of the icon in the top right corner of the browser window
2018-01-04T18:52:03 <gmoss> danayo: I took a look at what you wrote up, it looks great! the only thing I could add was the URL to the online high school, but otherwise I think you covered everything else that isn\'t already mentioned on the SJRK site.
2018-01-04T18:52:10 <danayo> i see sepidehshahi - that one is a little less clear when small isn\'t it?  I wonder if adding a tiny bit more of a gap between the gear and the figure would help
2018-01-04T18:52:23 <danayo> thanks gmoss
2018-01-04T18:53:21 <danayo> or sepidehshahi - what if the head of the hugger was solid? there\'s just something about the open circle that I think makes it less clear
2018-01-04T18:53:48 <danayo> and sorry to jump in to the discussion so late with all these opinions :)
2018-01-04T18:53:51 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: as danayo the small icon is not very clear yet. give me a few minutes to move the gear a little bit to see if it helps. thanks
2018-01-04T18:54:33 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, danayo: thanks
2018-01-04T18:55:46 <danayo> gtirloni: I can\'t seem to get owncloud to sync. in my settings I see an error message "No connection to ownCloud at https:... Error downloading https....  and there was a message about some files that were too big. I selected "Apply" and now it just shows a Waiting message
2018-01-04T18:57:06 <gtirloni> danayo: what\'s the file\'s size?
2018-01-04T18:57:54 <danayo> hmmm...unfortunately I can\'t see that message anymore so I\'m not sure which files it mentioned
2018-01-04T18:58:03 <danayo> let me check
2018-01-04T18:58:35 <danayo> it mentioned the chart authoring tool, but I\'m not sure where the file is!
2018-01-04T18:58:50 <Justin_o> danayo: if you go to the settings for the ownCloud app and look in the activity you might see the file or the error there
2018-01-04T18:59:19 <danayo> yes, i did, but then the 2ndary error message cleared when I selected Apply
2018-01-04T18:59:31 <danayo> I still see the other message (no connection etc)
2018-01-04T19:00:10 <gtirloni> one sec
2018-01-04T19:01:03 <gtirloni> could you try now?
2018-01-04T19:02:03 <gtirloni> maybe try closing/opening the app too
2018-01-04T19:02:34 <danayo> sure
2018-01-04T19:02:41 <gtirloni> i see some uploads to the UIO folder now
2018-01-04T19:05:11 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: I just updated the assets
2018-01-04T19:05:33 <danayo> no luck gtirloni, those weren\'t my uploads :(
2018-01-04T19:06:06 <gtirloni> danayo: see if you are running version 10.x of the client.. maybe in the settings window it shows it
2018-01-04T19:06:28 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks, i\'ll take another look
2018-01-04T19:06:49 <sepidehshahi> Thanks Justin_o
2018-01-04T19:08:37 <danayo> gtirloni: the client version I have is 2.2.3.  Looks like 2.4.0 is the latest?
2018-01-04T19:09:41 <gtirloni> yeah, 2.2 should work though... weird. i\'d try to update just in case.
2018-01-04T19:11:01 <danayo> sorry for delay grrrero - owncloud issues
2018-01-04T19:12:01 <grrrero> no worries danayo, I\'m just going to head home to pick up a parcel and I\'ll be working from home after
2018-01-04T19:12:09 <danayo> ok
2018-01-04T19:13:22 <gtirloni> danayo: your client seems to be scanning the remote files to figure out what it needs to upload. any errors so far?
2018-01-04T19:13:36 <danayo> looks good so far gtirloni
2018-01-04T19:13:43 <danayo> the update seems to have helped
2018-01-04T19:14:45 <gtirloni> cool

2018-01-04T19:42:30 <Justin_o> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2745
2018-01-04T19:42:53 <Justin_o> anyways, i\'m heading offline now. I\'ll chat with you some more on monday about this though if you have time
2018-01-04T19:44:32 <sepidehshahi> Sure, Thanks a lot Justin_o. We will talk next week. it was very minor just a few pixels, but I can see the difference :)

2018-01-04T20:07:01 <gtirloni> danayo: i don\'t see any traffic coming into the server right now. the last operation i see from your client was deleting a sjrk landing page sketch
2018-01-04T20:07:46 <gtirloni> does it say there are more files to upload?
2018-01-04T20:07:49 <danayo> i see it syncing new files / updated files, but it is taking forever to sync 22MB
2018-01-04T20:09:11 <Caren_> simonjb: Hi! I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you might have access to some science items I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for to set up a Faraday\xe2\x80\x99s Law demo/experiment\xe2\x80\x94electromagnetic induction. In particular a voltage meter and a bar magnet with north and south poles.
2018-01-04T20:09:39 <Caren_> here is a vidyo I\xe2\x80\x99m using as a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwIdZjjd8fo
2018-01-04T20:09:48 <gtirloni> danayo: it could be a bad connection. i see traffic to your address is having 25% packet loss right now
2018-01-04T20:10:41 <gtirloni> latency gets really high somewhere inside "Big Pipe Inc." (your ISP?) and then it doubles when it reaches your addr
2018-01-04T20:11:14 <danayo> maybe I need to climb the tree gtirloni :)
2018-01-04T20:11:18 <gtirloni> 200-500ms range.. normally it shouldn\'t be much higher than 30-60ms inside canada
2018-01-04T20:11:22 <gtirloni> lol
2018-01-04T20:12:19 <danayo> any ideas what could cause that gtirloni? maybe I can pass it on to my ISP  :P
2018-01-04T20:13:48 <gtirloni> it\'s hard to say.. the fact that it gets so bad inside their network before it reaches you seems to be to some overloading on their network
2018-01-04T20:14:13 <gtirloni> and then the packet loss on your end seems to be a bad connection since it\'s wireless.. maybe not a good signal
2018-01-04T20:15:42 <gtirloni> h69-196-79-162.bigpipeinc.com (69.196.79.162) --- this is their "hop" (or device/switch/router) from where the connection gets really bad
2018-01-04T20:15:49 <gtirloni> it\'s "3 hops" from your address
2018-01-04T20:16:24 <danayo> ok thanks gtirloni
2018-01-04T20:16:38 <danayo> the speed is really variable sometimes
2018-01-04T20:16:48 <gtirloni> maybe that will give them a clue :) it\'s certainly not "just" your signal
2018-01-04T20:16:54 <danayo> cool
2018-01-04T20:16:58 <danayo> cool not cool!
2018-01-04T20:17:03 <gtirloni> this could be where their network goes from wired/fiber to wireless... who knows
2018-01-04T20:17:09 <gtirloni> definitely not cool :)
