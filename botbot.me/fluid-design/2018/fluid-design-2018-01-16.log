2018-01-16T18:50:56 <Justin_o> jhung: question about the icons for the prefs framework
2018-01-16T18:51:13 <jhung> Justin_o: sure
2018-01-16T18:51:32 <Justin_o> jhung: the old font included icons that weren't actually being used in the prefs framework.. do you think i should still include those, or just pull them out?
2018-01-16T18:52:53 <jhung> Justin_o: why were they there if they weren't being used?
2018-01-16T18:54:17 <Justin_o> jhung: not sure.. perhaps that file was used in other projects.. or maybe they were part of some other design that wasn't implemented or something else
2018-01-16T18:54:31 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2018-01-16T18:56:46 <jhung> Justin_o: I think if we can figure out its original purpose that would be good. That way we can at least document it in case it comes up, or even leave a copy with the design (assuming it's a design that used it).
2018-01-16T18:56:54 <jhung> Justin_o: can you point me to the files in github?
2018-01-16T18:57:11 <Justin_o> jhung:  the fonts?
2018-01-16T18:57:38 <Justin_o> jhung: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/src/framework/preferences/fonts
2018-01-16T19:01:05 <jhung> Justin_o: I see a reference to those fonts in the PrefsEditor.styl file.
2018-01-16T19:01:24 <Justin_o> jhung: there are extra icons in the font though
2018-01-16T19:01:51 <Justin_o> i'm wondering if should keep including them in the new font that we'll be generating
2018-01-16T19:02:21 <jhung> ah. I think I misunderstood your original question Justin_o. :) So what you're saying is that there are glyphs in the font which aren't being used
2018-01-16T19:02:29 <Justin_o> yep
2018-01-16T19:02:39 <Justin_o> at least not by something in infusion
2018-01-16T19:02:57 <jhung> before I say remove them I'd like to see what they are Justin_o. Do you have it handy?

2018-01-16T20:45:18 <sepidehshahi> Hi grrrero, I am looking at the infusion icons list on Github and not sure if all of them are still needed e.g. top-of-page, star, show-more, etc. I was wondering if you had more info about these icons and the places they might have been used. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/tree/master/svg
2018-01-16T20:46:18 <sepidehshahi> we may need to recreate some of these icons. so, I wanted to make sure we only create the ones that are up to date and needed
2018-01-16T20:46:25 <grrrero> Hi sepidehshahi -- I don't know much about where or when these icons have been used, they were all there when I converted them without thinking about whether they're still needed
2018-01-16T20:46:47 <grrrero> I guess you can go ahead and update the ones you need?
2018-01-16T20:47:16 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks grrrero
2018-01-16T20:47:19 <grrrero> np
