2018-05-09T16:58:47 <Justin_o> jhung: hello, so about the orator component. What I\'m working on at the moment is https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6177
2018-05-09T16:59:46 <Justin_o> The thing I\'m puzzling through at the moment is how to get this to work with the DOM reading behaviour that is implemented and under review in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/898
2018-05-09T17:00:02 * lliskovoi has quit
2018-05-09T17:00:37 <Justin_o> with the orator, as in the PR above, there is a  button provided for play/pausing the read back of text from the DOM. This is configurable, but would most likely be the main content or article on a web page
2018-05-09T17:00:46 <Justin_o> It will also highlight the text as it is being read back.
2018-05-09T17:01:27 <Justin_o> the new feature as mentioned in FLUID-6177 would provide the ability to highlight some text and have a "Play" button appear over the selection. The user would then be able to click the button to play back the selected text.
2018-05-09T17:01:57 <Justin_o> However, the web speech api only provides a single queue for synthesis.
2018-05-09T17:02:02 * simonjb joined the channel
2018-05-09T17:02:04 <jhung> Justin_o: ah.
2018-05-09T17:02:25 <jhung> Ok. This is where I became curious as there may be something from PhET which may be helpful / insightful Justin_o
2018-05-09T17:02:38 <Justin_o> In the TextToSpeech component, which is our wrapper component we also have a single queue which does have the option to interrupt, but at the moment that just replaces to queue with whatever new text is to spoken
2018-05-09T17:02:51 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, that\'s great.
2018-05-09T17:03:27 <jhung> Jesse and co. have created a component called an "utterance queue" which allows you to schedule, remove (based on decay), add items to a queue to be read back.
2018-05-09T17:03:55 <jhung> I only know a little about what it does but it could be useful for what you\'re looking for.

2018-05-09T14:13:29 <jhung1> An interesting side effect of Chrome\'s auto-mute feature is that it disables sonification in PhET sims.
2018-05-09T14:13:36 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2018-05-09T14:15:25 <colinclark> jhung: Yes, it\'s become a real issue for a lot of people
2018-05-09T14:15:28 <colinclark> especially game developers
2018-05-09T14:15:31 <colinclark> also artists
2018-05-09T14:15:51 <colinclark> It\'s a feature that\'s been on Safari on iOS for several years
2018-05-09T14:16:21 <colinclark> basically, all AudioContexts will not start unless they are triggered by a user action of some kind
2018-05-09T14:17:05 <colinclark> There is a little script floating around that can be added to any page to show an unmute button that will start any AudioContexts running on the page
2018-05-09T14:17:13 <colinclark> but I think it\'s probably not a viable solutions for real applications
2018-05-09T14:17:39 <colinclark> and sadly I imagine PhET will need to have a big unmute button rolled directly into their user interface
2018-05-09T14:17:50 <colinclark> at least until Google reconsiders their decision
2018-05-09T14:19:37 <jhung> colinclark: indeed. I think this is only a real issue for some of the sims like the ones that don\'t start with a splash-screen menu and start with some initial ambient sound.
2018-05-09T14:19:49 <colinclark> right
2018-05-09T14:19:56 <colinclark> this was what game developers were upset about
2018-05-09T14:20:01 <jhung> although the demo Mike was showing last week of Faraday, the sound was muted even after the magnet was picked up.
2018-05-09T14:20:06 <colinclark> that they often include intro screens that play music
2018-05-09T14:20:28 <colinclark> jhung: That my just be because of the way they\'ve written their code
2018-05-09T14:21:01 <colinclark> this was always the issue with Safari on iOS
2018-05-09T14:21:18 <colinclark> making sure all your event handlers were capable of starting the audio if it hadn\'t already been
2018-05-09T14:22:01 <colinclark> I loved that video you shared, by the way, jhung
2018-05-09T14:22:12 <colinclark> It\'s still so great to see that they\'re using the OSC bridge we built for them
2018-05-09T14:22:47 <colinclark> I\'m only bummed out that we still haven\'t had the chance to offer more\xe2\x80\x94a web audio environment that would have been approachable to people who are already familiar with other sonification tools like SuperCollider
2018-05-09T14:23:30 * michelled joined the channel
2018-05-09T14:25:35 <jhung> colinclark: At least this is a good example of the potential of better tools. Hopefully there will be future opportunities to do more. Mike was very pleased when I said I was going to share the link to the IDRC community.

2018-05-09T15:07:15 <lliskovoi> avtar: I love that coral shade! I like that the blue is a nod to the IDRC logo, but I think it vibrates against the pinker colours a bit, particularly the coral. I would experiment with another cool colour that can bring it together a bit maybe
2018-05-09T15:08:16 <lliskovoi> avtar: what was your thought process for the colours?
2018-05-09T15:09:57 <sepidehshahi> I agree with lliskovoi, I had difficulty with the blue vibrating against the pink
2018-05-09T15:10:36 <Caren_> sorry, my google link to the folder was incorrect. Here is the correct one: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ya8FYpxjJqdF0qaHLHtdKphYEwZoeuJH
2018-05-09T15:12:16 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar: +1 to what lliskovoi and sepidehshahi said; colours look great but the blue might need a change in its saturation maybe?
2018-05-09T15:13:31 <avtar> lliskovoi: thanks for the feedback, i\'ll try a few different blues. i\'ll be replacing the banner with a map collage (similar to this style https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/b8/1a/64b81a5997357ad93e3641224a9502f9.jpg) so i was looking for enough contrast to make the button stand out. other than that the process was just me going through colour palettes that caught my eye and then tweaking them using https://webaim.org/resources/cont

2018-05-09T15:13:37 <neuralmilkhotel> Caren_: Thanks so much for the tip yesterday re: letter-spacing on the inclusive cities site -- I\'ll experiment with that today :)
2018-05-09T15:13:37 <sepidehshahi> avtar: your color scheme kinds of remind me of this sit\xe2\x80\x99s colors https://internetfreedomfestival.org/
2018-05-09T15:14:13 <avtar> sepidehshahi: uh ohhh
2018-05-09T15:14:32 <avtar> maybe i could just use that blue :P
2018-05-09T15:15:32 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar: Maybe use the two pinks, the black, and instead of the blue try using #78EEFF ?
2018-05-09T15:15:57 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: there\'s lots that I like about that https://internetfreedomfestival.org/ site but I find all the red very tiring on the eyes
2018-05-09T15:16:59 <neuralmilkhotel> avtar: Or playing around with the blue... #A0F3FF
2018-05-09T15:18:06 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: I totally agree with you about the the red/orange color
2018-05-09T15:21:10 <lliskovoi> avtar: I would take a step back, articulate what you want the colour palette to make people feel/think first, even if broadly, decide on whether you want it to be playful, serious, inspiring, menacing (maybe not menacing, but you know what I mean) first, and then pick colours from there.
2018-05-09T15:22:14 <neuralmilkhotel> Caren_: sepidehshahi and lliskovoi (and danayo I think!) were talking yesterday about accessibility in logo design... maybe you have thoughts on that as well?
2018-05-09T15:24:08 <avtar> lliskovoi: yup, definitely not menacing :P but playful and sketchy
2018-05-09T15:25:10 <Caren_> neuralmilkhotel: interesting. What sort of things are you thinking re: accessibility in logo design?
2018-05-09T15:25:58 <Caren_> tech accessible?
2018-05-09T15:26:19 <neuralmilkhotel> Caren_: "do you know of any good resources around inclusive design for graphics/branding? Specifically logos, but can be more broad" -- from lliskovoi\'s question on May 7th
2018-05-09T15:26:32 <neuralmilkhotel> Sorry not accessibility :)
2018-05-09T15:27:03 <simonjb> avtar, lliskovoi: I think playful is always good, but I do feel in this case, we need some seriousness as it\'s a project with potentially pretty big implications for the city and for other cities
2018-05-09T15:29:39 <lliskovoi> simonjb: that\'s a really good point

2018-05-09T15:31:15 <simonjb> I would worry a little that too playful might communicate that we aren\'t taking the difficult issues seriously enough
2018-05-09T15:31:46 <simonjb> there\'s a lot of fear and concern around this work
2018-05-09T15:32:08 <lliskovoi> simonjb, avtar, I also think trust is something that we should try to communicate with the site
2018-05-09T15:32:25 <simonjb> agreed
2018-05-09T15:32:54 <avtar> lliskovoi, simonjb: that\'s great feedback, i\'ll try a few more options
2018-05-09T15:33:15 <lliskovoi> maybe \'reassured" is more accurate
2018-05-09T15:34:03 <Caren_> avtar: lliskovoi simonjb re: colour. maybe consider existing colours drawn from a \xe2\x80\x9ccity\xe2\x80\x9d given that the project is not necessarily rebuilding a city but building upon. Looking at pictures of cities and seeing if there is a palette that emerges and build from there.
2018-05-09T15:36:30 <lliskovoi> Caren_: that\'s a great idea, grey and green are the first colours that come to mind, which might actually be good at accomplishing a balance between seriousness/stability, with hopefulness/joy
2018-05-09T15:36:38 <lliskovoi> avtar, simonjb ^
2018-05-09T15:38:02 <Caren_> lliskovoi: nice! and those colours can ground a design when you build a palette out to include \xe2\x80\x9cbrighter\xe2\x80\x9d colours.
2018-05-09T15:38:12 <avtar> Caren_, lliskovoi: thanks, i\'ll try an approach with that in mind \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f
2018-05-09T15:39:04 <lliskovoi> Caren_, avtar: and the IDRC blue could work really well in that palette, bringing in the waterfront elements as well
2018-05-09T15:39:44 <Caren_> I can smell the green :-). avtar and lliskovoi
2018-05-09T15:40:17 <avtar> lliskovoi: that sounds good.. i was planning on showing part of a waterfront (not necessarily the toronto one) in the map collage as well
2018-05-09T15:40:59 <lliskovoi> avtar: cool! that could bring it together nicely!
2018-05-09T15:41:32 <lliskovoi> [insert Big Lebowski rug gif]
2018-05-09T15:42:16 <avtar> lol
2018-05-09T15:42:49 <Caren_> lliskovoi: haaha\xe2\x80\xa6I actually inserted that into google \xe2\x80\xa6 always learning. Very funny.
2018-05-09T15:43:15 <avtar> same here
2018-05-09T15:43:30 <Caren_> :D

2018-05-09T16:09:23 <Caren_> neuralmilkhotel: I dont\xe2\x80\x99 know of any resources specifically for inclusive design of logos. I do think there are design practices that contribute to more inclusive logos or wordmarks. Some of the resources I shared include some of those practices\xe2\x80\xa6but those practices aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily outofthebox and need to fit the context. Were there any resources shared in your conversation? I could put them into our google
2018-05-09T16:09:24 <Caren_> doc!
2018-05-09T16:10:28 <neuralmilkhotel> Caren_: Just a link to sepidehshahi\'s visual style guide for UIO options https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Icons+Visual+Style+Guide
