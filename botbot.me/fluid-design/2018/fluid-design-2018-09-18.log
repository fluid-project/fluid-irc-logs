2018-09-18T15:04:34 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I'm on my way in via subway today but it's pretty severely delayed, so I'm not sure what time I'll get in. Original eta was 11 but that is clearly out the window as I've only made it three stations (out of 17) in over half an hour. I can update storytelling tool for planning upon my arrival
2018-09-18T15:10:15 <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning is starting soon

2018-09-18T20:49:20 <gmoss> danayo: do we have a link to a wiki page with an agenda for our face-to-face on the 10th?
2018-09-18T20:49:40 <danayo> not yet gmoss :)
2018-09-18T20:49:42 <gmoss> Jutta has asked for anything resembling an agenda, just now
2018-09-18T20:49:48 <gmoss> okay, thanks danayo!

2018-09-18T20:50:01 <danayo> I'll create one now gmoss
2018-09-18T20:50:23 <gmoss> perfect, thank you! I think if you send the link directly to her that would be easiest
2018-09-18T20:50:37 <gmoss> I'll let her know to expect something
2018-09-18T20:50:50 <gmoss> (I hope that isn't creating too much pressure)
2018-09-18T21:01:05 * danayo works well under pressure
2018-09-18T21:01:17 <danayo> gmoss: how's this for starters https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Face+to+Face+Partners+Meeting+October+10%2C+2018+-+Agenda
2018-09-18T21:01:22 <danayo> michelled ^
2018-09-18T21:01:46 <danayo> let me know what you think as a rough start and I'll send Jutta the link
2018-09-18T21:05:08 <gmoss> danayo: looks great to me :) I think it sums up our discussion from earlier quite well
2018-09-18T21:33:31 <gmoss> danayo: fyi, JT requested the link again so I sent it to her
2018-09-18T21:33:58 <gmoss> she seemed mildly hurried
2018-09-18T21:35:35 <danayo> no worries gmoss, thanks
