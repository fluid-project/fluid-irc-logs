2018-08-03T18:48:28 <jhung> Caren_: I\'ve updated the SNOW site. You should be able to work from the Pages tree in the backend now for everything. Also no need to use Categories anymore, and no need to specify "is_landing_page" metadata. Just structure it the way you want in the backend, and it should show up that way on the site.
2018-08-03T18:49:14 <Caren_> a designer\xe2\x80\x99s dream! thanks jhung :-)
2018-08-03T18:50:05 <jhung> You dream of Wordpress Caren_? Sounds nightmarish!! lol
2018-08-03T18:50:12 <jhung> and no prob. :)
2018-08-03T18:51:55 <jhung> If you could Caren_, if you can go over the SNOW Jiras and comment on the ones that are fixed that would be great. Then I\'ll go through and Close them once you\'ve confirmed they fix the issues.
2018-08-03T18:51:56 <Caren_> haha\xe2\x80\xa6all relative. Now a dream given the visual logic which I personally like to work with jhung
2018-08-03T18:52:19 <jhung> Keep dreaming Caren_!! haha
2018-08-03T18:53:14 <Caren_> :D
