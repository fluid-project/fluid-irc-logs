2018-10-01T15:46:55 <jhung> michelled: I thought there was going to be a combination of talks and videos? Maybe I misunderstood.
2018-10-01T15:47:19 <michelled> I thought vera said there would be no place for talks?
2018-10-01T15:47:29 <michelled> because of needing to set the room up in a particular way
2018-10-01T15:47:52 <michelled> and then there was conversation about having the talks in the black box theatre which we felt would mean talking to an empty room
2018-10-01T15:47:59 <michelled> and then we came up with the idea of the videos
2018-10-01T15:48:19 <michelled> anyway, I don't want Avtar and I to spend a bunch of time making this compilation if that's not the plan :)
2018-10-01T15:50:00 <jhung> I'll email Vera and Jess to get clarification.
2018-10-01T15:50:09 <michelled> great! maybe cc the everyone list?
2018-10-01T15:50:12 <michelled> thank you!

2018-10-01T21:04:26 <gmoss> michelled: I was about to share the GSoC article with my students, but I noticed the link on the FLOE news page has a typo: https://floeproject.org/news/2018-09-17-GSoc2018.html should be https://floeproject.org/news/2018-09-17-GSoC2018.html
2018-10-01T21:04:33 <gmoss> (capital C in GSoC)
2018-10-01T21:04:44 <gmoss> is this something I can fix and PR?
2018-10-01T21:04:46 * clown has quit
2018-10-01T21:07:09 <michelled> bizarre, I'm sure I tested that
2018-10-01T21:07:14 <gmoss> I also noticed that Spifind isn't hosted yet, I guess we never sorted that out
2018-10-01T21:07:27 <michelled> no, and we aren't going to spend time trying to do that right now
2018-10-01T21:07:53 <gmoss> michelled: maybe it depends on the hosting system. iirc some servers are case-sensitive while others are not
2018-10-01T21:08:01 <gmoss> okay, good to know :)
2018-10-01T21:11:00 <michelled> alanharnum: I thought I had write access to the floeproject website
2018-10-01T21:11:08 <michelled> I was sure you gave it to me :)
2018-10-01T21:22:10 <alanharnum> floeproject: I gave you write access to SJRK, let me check if I have it to floeprojec
2018-10-01T21:23:50 <alanharnum> michelled: you should have access now
2018-10-01T21:25:04 <michelled> thx alanharnum
2018-10-01T22:01:21 <michelled> gmoss: that link should be fixed now - thanks for bringing it to my attention!
2018-10-01T22:01:56 <gmoss> michelled: confirmed, it's working for me now :) thank you!
2018-10-01T22:02:40 <michelled> np
2018-10-01T22:03:40 <gmoss> michelled: just tested all other article links and they are also working
2018-10-01T22:03:51 <michelled> cool
2018-10-01T22:03:52 <gmoss> just in case :)
