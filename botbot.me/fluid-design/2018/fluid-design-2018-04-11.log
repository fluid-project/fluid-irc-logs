2018-04-11T15:04:36 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I'm still at the bike shop, should be done relatively soon at which point I'll head to the IDRC. That said, I forgot to bring headphones with me this morning, so I won't be able to listen in on the standup meeting (it's too noisy here to use my phone's mic and speaker). My update: yesterday we had the design crit about locks, planning meeting, I worked on adding tests (SJRK-71), and then met with Michelle
2018-04-11T15:04:36 <gmoss> to do tasking and determine what we needed to do to get the Storytelling Tool ready for story sprints. Alan and Dana also weighed in on this. This morning I reviewed the test coverage for SJRK-71 and closed the issue, then started working on SJRK-69 (which is on the tasking list). My plan for the rest of the day is to continue with SJRK-69 and then the planning meeting. I'll likely pair with michelled at some point.

Have been working on SNOW items including promo of upcoming workshop and meeting with Taking it Global and their platform that hosts our workshops and alum/badging. I'm off to ASET conference in Niagara tomorrow and back end of day Friday. See you next week.

2018-04-11T20:12:39 <danayo> hey michelled, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m working on that news article and wanted to check - the only thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve added to the ILDH lately is the Learning Differences section, right? Or should I also mention Making and Hacking? (can\xe2\x80\x99t remember when we added that). Perhaps I will also mention that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of re-structuring it.
2018-04-11T20:15:18 <michelled> danayo: I think it's just learning differences
