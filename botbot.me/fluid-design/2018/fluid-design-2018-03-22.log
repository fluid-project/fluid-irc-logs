2018-03-22T14:40:27 <jessm> Justin_o: a gsoc question. i read through all the game proposals and put a comment on each in the GSOC page interface. the students are saying they can't see the comment. should i have put it onto the google doc of the proposal directly? do you know?
2018-03-22T14:41:11 <Justin_o> jessm: yes, sorry the interface is a bit confusing.. you should put the comments to the students in the google doc directly. I believe the comment section in the GSoC page is for the mentors
2018-03-22T14:41:29 <jessm> oh, well, that explains that. lol
2018-03-22T14:41:34 <jessm> so confusing!

2018-03-22T18:13:47 <sepidehshahi> absolutely danayo, feel better
2018-03-22T18:13:53 <danayo> thanks
2018-03-22T18:17:29 <jessm> janardan: YehchanP hiya
2018-03-22T18:17:44 <YehchanP> Hi
2018-03-22T18:17:51 <jessm> what's new today in thinking about users?
2018-03-22T18:18:00 <janardan> Hi
2018-03-22T18:18:26 <jessm> and any more examples of mismatch you've noticed?
2018-03-22T18:18:50 <janardan> Ive noticed some mismatches
2018-03-22T18:19:00 <janardan> But can you explain what you mean with users
2018-03-22T18:20:03 <jessm> janardan: YehchanP you were going to begin thinking of who you'll be designing the games for. The bike shed example from yesterday -- we can't begin to design it until we understand more about who will use it, in what context, for what goals... you were going to start from there with the games. yes?
2018-03-22T18:20:38 <jessm> and YehchanP have you had a chance to read the site from the coop students last year?
2018-03-22T18:20:54 <janardan> Yes, we are thinking about what age group it is, and how we will work out our game from there
2018-03-22T18:21:17 <YehchanP> Yes, I apparently was sent it a while ago and did read it. I didn't know that the website I read was from last year
2018-03-22T18:21:32 <jessm> janardan: ok, doing some research online will help. go to Youtube to see how kids use assistive technologies for example
2018-03-22T18:21:42 <jessm> YehchanP: ok, great
2018-03-22T18:22:03 <janardan> Just to confirm is it safe to say that the age group is from 6 - 9 or should we expect younger ones?
2018-03-22T18:22:10 <jessm> janardan: YehchanP just like yesterday, it's perhaps helpful to start with questions you have about who will use the game
2018-03-22T18:23:27 <jessm> janardan: good question. depends on which game -- the two descriptions are for two different user groups really. one is for pre-verbal, very young <2-3 year old children born blind; the second is for 6-8 year olds who use switches or eye tracking to navigate
2018-03-22T18:26:51 <janardan> jessm: the three of us were thinking in what kind of games appeal 6 - 8 year olds, and what we felt like we had a lot of fun with. However, since they do use switches, we need to see how much they know of the digital world, and which games they like to play, and which games appeal to them.
2018-03-22T18:27:31 <jessm> janardan: yes, justin and i sent you a number of links to games that we are told are popular with that age group
2018-03-22T18:27:35 <jessm> you still have that?
2018-03-22T18:29:13 <janardan> jessm: Yes we got the links of games that justin and you sent.
2018-03-22T18:29:54 <jessm> maybe look through those and discuss
2018-03-22T18:31:44 <janardan> Yeah, Yehchan is just watching those videos right now, looking at the games. I think we will start from there what type of game that we would create, and then start looking at how we can use switches, and what kind of clients we are dealing with

2018-03-22T18:52:20 <jessm> eye-gaze in particular
2018-03-22T18:52:43 <janardan> jessm: alright thanks, I was double checking with bert and he told me the difference of both.

2018-03-22T19:02:34 <jessm> danayo: i could send too... lemme do that
