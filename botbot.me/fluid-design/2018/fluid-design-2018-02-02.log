2018-02-02T13:45:52 <jhung> good morning grrrero. I\'ll be a couple minutes. If you want, you can start looking at the PR https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/62.
2018-02-02T13:46:07 <grrrero> Cool jhung
2018-02-02T13:46:15 <jhung> also I was thinking we should deal with https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/55 before we do the above PR.

2018-02-02T20:47:41 <colinclark> gtirloni: I was reading that earlier today\xe2\x80\x94it\'s pretty interesting in a quite a few ways
2018-02-02T20:47:46 <colinclark> what was your impression?
2018-02-02T20:52:12 <gtirloni> i\'m marvelled at that stuff.. i don\'t know how it works but it does, people looking at code and running it that way... since i don\'t know much about design in general, i just think it\'s super neat
2018-02-02T20:52:36 <gtirloni> i was thinking if that would be easier in a VR environment but i\'m not sure
2018-02-02T20:53:08 <gtirloni> (easier to implement, i\'d rank the physical experience higher)
2018-02-02T20:53:37 * jhung has quit
2018-02-02T20:56:43 <colinclark> ha
2018-02-02T20:56:50 <colinclark> yes
2018-02-02T20:57:04 <colinclark> you might just get dizzy and want to take a nap if it was in VR
2018-02-02T20:57:31 <colinclark> the "dependency by spatial proximity" was really fascinating to me
2018-02-02T20:57:35 <colinclark> and i love so much of it
2018-02-02T20:57:47 <colinclark> i just can\'t quite tell how it gets at what I think is your point
2018-02-02T20:58:11 <colinclark> how it mediates between physical and "virtual" expressions
2018-02-02T20:58:30 <colinclark> I realize that the aim is to avoid "virtuality" as much as possible in favour of physical artefacts, which is awesome
2018-02-02T20:58:50 <colinclark> but things that don\'t have such a tangible form have some curiously useful properties, like being infinitely reproducible
2018-02-02T20:59:20 <colinclark> I also started to contemplate the way physical and verbal and visual barriers start to reform in this environment
2018-02-02T20:59:58 <colinclark> I realize we have a very unique perspective, but I wondered what Dynamicland might say about someone who can\'t see what\'s on a piece of paper, or can\'t reach the table
2018-02-02T21:00:57 <colinclark> i don\'t want to sound critical\xe2\x80\x94I am also marvelling at it :)
2018-02-02T21:10:28 <gtirloni> no, i understand it and it makes sense
2018-02-02T21:10:34 <gtirloni> that\'s a good question
2018-02-02T21:12:02 <gtirloni> i can\'t find much (or anything) about them and a11y
