2018-06-11T15:25:48 <Caren_> When you have a moment could you have a look at the Imagine Your Dream City document, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made some notes.
2018-06-11T15:26:38 <Caren_> I think the design or the co-design event is really great
2018-06-11T15:27:24 <Caren_> I\xe2\x80\x99m heading to one of the schools early this afternoon and I will share the outline with them for feedback if that\xe2\x80\x99s ok with you.

2018-06-11T15:49:44 <sepidehshahi> Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great project. We just had a few questions about the warm activities they used to introduce the ideas behind inclusive design to kids

2018-06-11T15:50:35 <danayo> I can pass any questions along sepidehshahi - or I can ask Jan if it\xe2\x80\x99s ok if I connect you through email, if that would help?

2018-06-11T16:57:12 <danayo> jhung: We\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about our experiences in Colombia where we visited two rural schools and attended a workshop in the city of Medell\xc3\xadn, organised by Karisma. We\xe2\x80\x99ll show some photos and talk about what we did with the students, what we did at the workshop, and some of the issues that came up with the storytelling tool. Hope to also discuss collectively our next steps. Sound good michelled?
2018-06-11T17:01:18 <michelled> yep!
2018-06-11T17:02:50 <jhung> Awesome. Thanks danayo and michelled. The email to lists will go out shortly.

2018-06-11T19:09:04 <danayo> gmoss: sorry if I missed this, but did you or anyone else happen to take notes at the last partner\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?
2018-06-11T19:10:01 <danayo> and/or on the 15th?
2018-06-11T19:12:48 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-06-11T19:20:30 <gmoss> danayo: I have notes from the previous one (on the 29th), which I'll email you the link to. I missed the one on the 15th since I was having work done at my house at that time
2018-06-11T19:20:57 <danayo> thanks gmoss
2018-06-11T19:21:02 <gmoss> I hadn't distributed my notes from the 29th since it was a non-call, basically haha
2018-06-11T19:35:26 <gmoss> jhung: we talked briefly at the beginning of standup today about how the collab room will be occupied tomorrow, so I don't think we'll be physically in that room, though we'll be at the back of the IDRC office space or in the Red Room, I think
2018-06-11T19:35:41 <gmoss> (I tested out the computer at the back of the office today, it works fine, btw)
2018-06-11T19:35:57 <danayo> thanks gmoss!
2018-06-11T19:36:07 <jhung> gmoss: thanks. I'll write a follow-up to the email.
