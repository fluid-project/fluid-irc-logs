2018-01-25T20:59:14 <michelled> so interesting!
2018-01-25T20:59:51 <alanharnum> i first read about it (I think) in a PD James detective novel, where it was used by an especially sophisticated detective (book was written in the early 60s) as a means of organizing and querying case information
2018-01-25T21:02:27 <alanharnum> here\'s a close-up look at some of them being used as a pre-computer database of NEH grants: https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/featured-project/me-and-mr-mcbee
2018-01-25T21:23:09 <ussjoin> Wow, alanharnum. I\'ve seen those featured in books (e.g., Angelmaker) but hadn\'t seen photos. Neat!

2018-01-25T15:33:18 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, grrrero: I\'ve done some more digging into the font issue.. first off, here is a web ui for the underlying node based font generator that is being used. http://nfroidure.github.io/svgiconfont/
2018-01-25T15:33:26 <Justin_o> it\'s an easier way to test out the icons i think
2018-01-25T15:34:05 <grrrero> Ahh that\'s a good tool thanks Justin_o
2018-01-25T15:34:14 <Justin_o> so next thing I did was to change to use fontforge which requires a separate application (fontforge) be installed. This actually produced the icons properly... well i think they are done properly
2018-01-25T15:35:42 <grrrero> Interesting...
2018-01-25T15:37:26 <Justin_o> grrrero: yes, so it could be an issue with the node engine and the svgs we are using.
2018-01-25T15:37:47 <Justin_o> some sort of incompatibility..
2018-01-25T15:37:59 <grrrero> Justin_o: sepidehshahi and I were trying to figure out yesterday why the only icons that don\'t work are the ones with complicated shapes (curves, cut-outs, etc.)
2018-01-25T15:38:10 <grrrero> So yes I think node isn\'t rendering them properly because it can\'t undersetand
2018-01-25T15:38:10 <sepidehshahi> very interesting Justin_o, and this is such an easy tool to preview the font icon
2018-01-25T15:38:16 <grrrero> *undersetand
2018-01-25T15:38:21 <grrrero> *understand
2018-01-25T15:38:52 <grrrero> sepidehshahi tried to convert them to shapes
2018-01-25T15:39:06 <grrrero> And we found that the uncomplicated ones would have rectangles and such in their CSS
2018-01-25T15:39:14 <grrrero> But the complicated ones would not
2018-01-25T15:39:24 <Justin_o> grrrero: right, just the complex paths..
2018-01-25T15:39:32 <grrrero> And I think it might be the engine that cannot understand it and mucks it up
2018-01-25T15:40:06 <Justin_o> grrrero:  yes, it certainly seems so
2018-01-25T15:41:33 * danayo joined the channel
2018-01-25T15:41:47 <Justin_o> it\'s probablematic to use fontforge for the engine with the infusion builds, because there will be separate steps needed to do the full install.. i know it\'s just a dev dependency but it can potentially cause problems for the builds
2018-01-25T15:45:49 <jhung> sepidehshahi and danayo: I was wondering if either of you have time today to take a look at an idea I have for PhET. I mentioned earlier that the idea isn\'t great, but I wanted a 2nd opinion before I discarded it completely.
2018-01-25T15:47:21 <danayo> sure jhung
2018-01-25T15:49:27 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: here are some examples of words http://www.yougowords.com/4-letters/3-vowels/2-syllables
2018-01-25T15:49:59 <jhung> danayo: I\'ll let you know when. Looks like I might be meeting with cindyli and clown_ first. :)
2018-01-25T15:51:28 <Justin_o> grrrero: do you have any thoughts about using fontforge?
2018-01-25T15:56:48 <avtar> hi lliskovoi
2018-01-25T15:56:55 <cindyli> lliskovoi: do you have some time to meet with jhung, clown_, avtar and me to talk about some aria/screen reader issues for one of our projects
2018-01-25T15:57:01 <cindyli> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2774
2018-01-25T15:57:06 <clown_> cindyli, avtar, what is GPII-2774 about?
2018-01-25T15:57:22 <clown_> I\'ve read the description, but I can\'t tell what it\'s describing.
2018-01-25T15:58:01 <lliskovoi> cindyli, avtar: on a call right now, but I\'ll have time this afternoon
2018-01-25T15:58:24 <avtar> clown_: at the very least it\'s for making chart data, demo here https://qi.gpii.net/demos/noJquery-basic.html accessible to screen readers
2018-01-25T15:58:33 <clown_> thanks avtar
2018-01-25T15:58:51 <cindyli> ok. thanks, lliskovoi
2018-01-25T15:59:32 <cindyli> jhung, clown_, probably we can have a short meeting now so avtar and i can start the work. and if we have more questions for lliskovoi, more of us can gather this afternoon. what do you think
2018-01-25T16:00:11 <jhung> cindyli: sounds good.
2018-01-25T16:00:35 <cindyli> jhung, clown_, avtar, in my vidyo room
2018-01-25T16:00:55 <clown_> cindyli, okay but I won\'t have much to say since I\'m setill orienting myself.  Maybe that can be part of this meeting.
2018-01-25T16:01:07 <cindyli> sure

2018-01-25T16:09:10 <Justin_o> grrrero: do you have some time to chat about this now?

2018-01-25T16:24:23 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: My train to work has decided to travel at about half speed, and I won\'t be on time for standup. My update: yesterday I spent part of my time opening up a laptop to extract and recover files from its hard drive, then I redid the excellent work Simon and I did for SJRK-45 on Monday, as well as some further work to get the story model to propagate across views. The community meeting was interesting
2018-01-25T16:24:23 <gmoss> and illustrated many of the context-specific challenges of gathering inclusive design resources. Today I plan to continue working on the story model propagation, and perhaps add some more tests.
2018-01-25T16:24:39 <jhung> clown_: your interpretation is correct. It was to provide details for ATs while making it optional for visual users.
2018-01-25T16:25:20 <gmoss> Also, as alanharnum mentioned in his email, he helped me figure out an issue

2018-01-25T17:25:01 <danayo> jhung, sepidehshahi, could we meet at 1:15?

2018-01-25T18:20:38 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks for checking that.. could you try that again but specify fontforge as the engine
2018-01-25T18:20:47 <Justin_o> i imagine the result will be the same but want to check

2018-01-25T18:27:35 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay.. so i think we might be stuck with some modification of the old system them... unless there is a way to detect fontforge ahead of time
2018-01-25T18:31:34 <jhung> danayo and sepidehshahi, I\'m ready to chat. Caren_ are you free as well? I\'ll be talking about PhET
