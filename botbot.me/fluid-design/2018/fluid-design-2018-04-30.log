2018-04-30T17:42:46 <jhung> gtirloni: I'm looking into that navigation / localhost issue for fluidproject. The quick solution would be to edit line 36 of the docpad.coffee file (https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/blob/master/docpad.coffee#L36). But this won't prevent someone in the future from committing changes that line.
2018-04-30T17:53:18 <jhung> fluid-everyone: are there any topics for tomorrow's design crit?
2018-04-30T17:53:45 <sepidehshahi> hi jhung
2018-04-30T17:54:52 <danayo> jhung: if there are no other topics I think it would be good to look at the learning reflections story telling site https://stories.floeproject.org/
2018-04-30T17:54:55 <sepidehshahi> I have added a topic to the design crit table, if possible simonjb and I would like to discuss the Sidewalk project and get the community\xe2\x80\x99s feedback
2018-04-30T17:55:00 <danayo> ah!
2018-04-30T17:55:03 <danayo> sepidehshahi: that sounds good
2018-04-30T17:55:16 <sepidehshahi> we can talk about both danayo if we have time
2018-04-30T17:55:43 <danayo> sepidehshahi: sure, let\xe2\x80\x99s prioritize the sidewalk labs work
2018-04-30T17:55:50 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo: ok sounds good. Are there any artifacts to share in advance?
2018-04-30T18:01:42 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-04-30T18:07:13 <danayo> jhung: link to current instance at https://stories.floeproject.org/, I will also send you a link to mockups
2018-04-30T18:11:04 <jhung> great danayo. So for tomorrow we'll talk about the Sidewalk project and if time permits, the story telling.
2018-04-30T18:11:14 <danayo> yes jhung, thanks
2018-04-30T18:11:25 <jhung> ok. I'll send the email out.
2018-04-30T18:11:35 <danayo> maybe simonjb knows of some links? ^

2018-04-30T18:14:33 <sepidehshahi> jhung: you may want to share this link with the community. It includes very good questions about the Sidewalk project and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good starting point for our conversation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mD-jG5j3XWNoxiC1ZW6W7pcI5Pl71HVbqzfTg2H67eQ/edit
2018-04-30T18:15:17 <jhung> thanks!
2018-04-30T18:15:27 <danayo> jhung: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/krVQ1TGydvcpzSO, https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/Pp8aFj76L79fMcT, https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/B8xnZ8hf9ZTnT8R
2018-04-30T18:21:40 <jhung> danayo: how would you describe that last mockup? What is it called?

2018-04-30T18:49:56 <gtirloni> jhung: thanks. do you think it's possible to work with relative URLs? that way we can deploy the website anywhere and not worry. I'm not sure if docpad would be happy about that though. The approach I use yesterday was to define the url just for the 'static' environment, so it doesn't impact 'development': https://github.com/gtirloni-fluid/fluidproject.org/commit/83f27ef79beb294730d116c97f03162ab1d03492

2018-04-30T19:06:27 <michelled> danayo: sepi is busy with sidewalk, we might want to reschedule our meeting
2018-04-30T19:06:34 <colinclark> that's ok with me
2018-04-30T19:07:27 <danayo> sounds good
2018-04-30T19:08:36 * jhung joined the channel
2018-04-30T19:10:51 <danayo> jhung sorry I missed your ping earlier. that last mockup is showing the story view/search page
2018-04-30T19:10:54 <jhung> gtirloni: I'll look into that (relative vs. absolute URLs). Otherwise I'll look into doing a similar static / dev environment variable dor docpad.
2018-04-30T19:11:00 <jhung> danayo: thanks!
