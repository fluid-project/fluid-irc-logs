2018-04-10T20:41:05 <grrrero> Tel Aviv is another one https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2018/03/22/6-lessons-from-tel-aviv-for-successful-digital-transformation-of-smart-cities/

2018-04-10T20:49:18 <grrrero> Not really what can be considered a "smart city" really
2018-04-10T20:50:54 <grrrero> I think the parameters of what makes a city "smart" need to be defined...
