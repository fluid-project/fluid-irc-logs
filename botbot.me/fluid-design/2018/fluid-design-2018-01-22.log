2018-01-22T14:32:42 <sepidehshahi> Good morning Justin_o, I have updated the style guide with new artboard sizes. I was checking the infusion icons ai file on owncloud and the artboards are 64pt x 64pt. do you want them updated or are in the process of changing the artboard sizes?
2018-01-22T14:33:24 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i included an updated version of two of the files for that directory in my last e-mail.. did you get them, and if so, could you verify that I made it correctly?
2018-01-22T14:35:17 <sepidehshahi> yes Justin_o, I checked the ai file but artboards are 64pt by 64pt\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not opening the most updated version on my end. can you try opening it on your computer?
2018-01-22T14:36:38 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: sorry, i didn't push them to owncloud. i just attached them to the e-mail
2018-01-22T14:37:34 <sepidehshahi> so, I think that should be fine when you push it Justin_o
2018-01-22T14:38:16 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks.. i'll push that up now
2018-01-22T14:38:22 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2018-01-22T14:40:07 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: it should be updated on ownCloud now
2018-01-22T14:40:27 <sepidehshahi> great! I\xe2\x80\x99ll check it now
2018-01-22T14:41:59 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: the dimensions are all correct. thanks for updating the file
2018-01-22T14:42:15 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: no problem, thanks..

2018-01-22T15:29:14 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: I'm testing out the export of the icons from the master ai file and am having trouble with converting a couple of them to fonts
2018-01-22T15:29:40 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: could you take a look and make sure that they are all correctly drawn.. i'm worried that something might have happened when i was creating the new file
2018-01-22T15:29:50 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-01-22T15:29:59 <sepidehshahi> which ones are they? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any changes on the master file.
2018-01-22T15:30:04 <sepidehshahi> sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll do Justin_o
2018-01-22T15:30:11 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: specifically issues are with caption, preferences, size, and text-to-speech-reading
2018-01-22T15:30:15 <Justin_o> thank

2018-01-22T15:38:44 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: some of them were not single shapes. So, I fixed that, but there is no other problems with the ones you mentioned. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the problem is
2018-01-22T15:39:17 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks for fixing them up.. i'll try again and see how it works now
2018-01-22T15:39:26 <sepidehshahi> sure

2018-01-22T15:40:51 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Have to step out for some errands and might not be back for standup. My updates from the past Friday/weekend: worked on CSS changes that rolled back accidentally when my repo got updated to point to the dev site, worked on getting contrast themes to work with the theme. Today doing more of that.

2018-01-22T18:35:50 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: the page width icon, do you know what it doea? is it supposed to change the width of the browser window?
2018-01-22T18:37:03 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i'm not actually sure where that came from
2018-01-22T18:37:29 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: if i'd have to guess it would be to change the max width, but i'm not sure.. maybe jhung or danayo might know
2018-01-22T18:40:08 <jhung> Justin_o and sepidehshahi - I had to look it up. It seems it was an adjuster which increased the width of a container, similar to switching between responsive modes. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+UI+Options+Design+Specifications%2C+C.1
2018-01-22T18:40:56 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2018-01-22T18:41:10 <sepidehshahi> thanks jhung it clarifies the current design of the icon
