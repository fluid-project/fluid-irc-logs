2018-06-07T15:07:40 <gmoss> good luck, jhung!
2018-06-07T15:07:51 <clown> walking to the poll station, jhung?
2018-06-07T15:12:15 <michelled> so you think jhung-away - I\'ve never seen such turn out - took me a *long* time to vote today
2018-06-07T15:15:34 <avtar> michelled: what time did you show up there?
2018-06-07T15:16:41 <michelled> 9:15ish
2018-06-07T15:16:44 <avtar> ah ok
2018-06-07T15:16:53 <avtar> i\'m assuming the lines won\'t be crazy midday

2018-06-07T15:26:48 <jhung> I drove to the poll station\xe2\x80\xa6. don\'t judge. :D
2018-06-07T15:27:22 <avtar> too late
2018-06-07T15:27:24 <avtar> judging
2018-06-07T15:29:41 <jhung> lol I suppose I should accept that.
2018-06-07T15:30:37 <avtar> :P
2018-06-07T15:46:47 <jhung> colinclark: I missed your update - what was this about weather stations?
2018-06-07T15:47:07 <colinclark> ha\xe2\x80\x94my update did not mention weather stations :)
2018-06-07T15:47:26 <colinclark> but danayo was talking about the work by Andrew Simon related to citizen science
2018-06-07T15:47:41 <colinclark> and we are looking at a stream of SJRK related to supporting environmental activism
2018-06-07T15:47:55 <jhung> ah ok. cool!
2018-06-07T15:48:30 <colinclark> I think she was speculating on connections with the Guardians in Colombia
2018-06-07T15:48:46 <colinclark> "The Guardians are a group of approximately 2000 youth volunteers in Cartagena who investigate, document and report environmental issues in their community such as improper waste disposal, water quality issues, noise pollution and exotic/wild animals in captivity."
2018-06-07T15:49:06 <jhung> That\'d be very cool.
2018-06-07T15:52:22 <jhung> lliskovoi, during the CAST-CISL call yesterday hypothes.is came up.
2018-06-07T15:52:34 <lliskovoi> oh awesome!
2018-06-07T15:53:05 <gmoss> michelled: what time do you think you\'d like to pair today? as i mentioned in standup I\'m pretty well free all day, just depends on when the furnace tech shows up
2018-06-07T16:00:56 <michelled> gmoss: I\'m thinking after the BiT tasking, so maybe 2:30
2018-06-07T16:01:08 <gmoss> michelled: okay, sounds good :)
