2018-10-26T13:02:37 <carenwatkins_> Hi all, quickly checking in and see there was a request for photos from DEEP. There are a few from the 25th event filed under IDRC-Event-Images in a folder called 25th Anniversary (pls check with Justin about using any pics of Hannah--I'm not sure if he's reviewed and removed them yet).

2018-10-26T18:04:41 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung, do you know if we have a topic for next week design crit?
2018-10-26T18:08:39 <jhung> Hi sepidehshahi - nothing yet. Do you have something?
2018-10-26T18:09:27 <avtar> jhung, sepidehshahi: if there's time i'd like to squeeze in the sjrk site as a topic https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/MQ5n1mlALfb86Nw#pdfviewer
2018-10-26T18:09:39 <avtar> i'll have a couple revisions
2018-10-26T18:09:39 <sepidehshahi> yes jhung, could we use the time to share our sketches for the inclusive cities toolkit?
2018-10-26T18:10:16 <sepidehshahi> avtar: maybe we could split the session. We won\xe2\x80\x99t need more than half hour
2018-10-26T18:10:39 <sepidehshahi> or we can talk about the cities toolkit in the community meeting so avtar can take the design crit
2018-10-26T18:11:16 <avtar> splitting the session sounds good
2018-10-26T18:13:24 <jhung> great. avtar and sepidehshahi, could you both give me a short description what is being discussed and what you hope to get out of the discussion?
2018-10-26T18:13:46 <sepidehshahi> sure jhung
2018-10-26T18:13:48 <jhung> You can tell me here or email it to me. I'm fine either way
2018-10-26T18:13:53 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99ll email that to you
2018-10-26T18:13:56 <jhung> ok
2018-10-26T18:20:33 <avtar> jhung: i'll email as well

2018-10-26T20:03:22 <alanharnum> late Friday video of interest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5-bHJqtQS0 - Google's Creatability project, similar to some of the work we've done with the Nexus
2018-10-26T20:03:31 <alanharnum> colinclark simonjb in particular ^
2018-10-26T20:04:15 <colinclark> oh yes
2018-10-26T20:04:27 <colinclark> this just hit the news yesterday and I've been meaning to take some time to look at it
2018-10-26T20:05:59 <alanharnum> one of the interesting claims is that the machine learning is all browser-side using https://js.tensorflow.org/, so it can learn an individual's body models without needing to push any images to a remote server
2018-10-26T20:06:14 <colinclark> that's interesting
2018-10-26T20:10:55 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: this is incredible! thanks for sharing. One of the biggest challenges we dealt with in our co-design sessions were when people with different abilities wanted to sketch or build something together, and our tools were really inaccessible\xe2\x80\xa6 I can see how in the future actual collaboration can be made possible
