2018-04-05T15:30:54 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: my internet\xe2\x80\x99s being wonky, so will give standup status here: yesterday and today was going over the PR request comments jhubg had for the wp-a11y-theme, also working on on fluid-5525 for UIO, replacing/adding OpenDyslexia instead of Comic Sans, quick chat with Justib about that as well. Will be meeting with michelled to estimate the tasks we talked about in the snow meeting, and also have an appt at

2018-04-05T15:55:13 <sepidehshahi> danayo: it\xe2\x80\x99s funny how Kat Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 name keeps coming up in different conversations these days. colinclark mentioned that she is writing a book about inclusion called \xe2\x80\x98Mismatch\xe2\x80\x99. I was checking her company\xe2\x80\x99s website, they have listed IDRC on their resource page but there is no mention of our Guide in their toolkit section. and that makes me really sad\xe2\x80\xa6 https://www.katacompany.com/resources/
2018-04-05T15:56:13 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: when would be a good time for you to talk about ILDH?
2018-04-05T15:56:39 <colinclark> sepidehshahi: makes me a little sad too :)
2018-04-05T15:56:42 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: any time is fine
2018-04-05T15:56:54 <colinclark> but it really is remarkable to see our work being popularized
2018-04-05T15:57:20 <danayo> sepidehshahi: perhaps we should suggest she add a link :)
2018-04-05T15:57:48 <danayo> I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s not slick enough
2018-04-05T15:57:56 <danayo> which is a good thing :)
2018-04-05T15:58:06 <colinclark> ha :)
2018-04-05T15:58:19 <danayo> and I agree it is great to see our work popularized colinclark
2018-04-05T15:58:26 <colinclark> but we do have a really awesome video about it, danayo
2018-04-05T15:58:28 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea danayo.
2018-04-05T15:58:31 <colinclark> maybe we should send it to her :)
2018-04-05T15:58:32 <danayo> we do colinclark !
2018-04-05T15:58:35 <danayo> we should!
2018-04-05T15:58:43 <danayo> we need to fix the audio first :)
2018-04-05T15:58:58 <colinclark> we did!
2018-04-05T15:59:02 <danayo> we did? !
2018-04-05T15:59:05 <danayo> excelelnt
2018-04-05T15:59:09 <danayo> I think I had an old link
2018-04-05T15:59:18 <danayo> where is it?
2018-04-05T15:59:21 <colinclark> yeah, I should probably just delete that old video now that the new one is up
2018-04-05T15:59:35 <colinclark> i did unpublish the old one, so it shouldn\'t be searchable or anything
2018-04-05T15:59:42 <colinclark> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESyrapafICE
2018-04-05T15:59:46 <danayo> ok great colinclark
2018-04-05T15:59:46 <danayo> thanks
2018-04-05T15:59:51 <colinclark> From the old video, there\'s a link to the fixed one
2018-04-05T16:00:09 <danayo> ok great
2018-04-05T16:00:20 <danayo> it\xe2\x80\x99s SLICK :D

2018-04-05T16:09:56 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I was talking to michelled and we thought it would be great to add the video to the landing page of the guide as well
2018-04-05T16:10:20 <danayo> oh yeah, we should!
2018-04-05T16:10:21 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: at yesterday\'s meeting we talked a bit about doing another design guide activities community meeting. Do you have an idea of when you\'d like to do that?
2018-04-05T16:10:33 <danayo> good idea michelled, sepidehshahi
2018-04-05T16:10:37 <danayo> I will add a link
2018-04-05T16:11:30 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: you mentioned there are some openings in May. I\xe2\x80\x99m available in May
2018-04-05T16:11:53 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: yes, everything except for May 23rd are open at the moment
2018-04-05T16:11:58 <Justin_o> perhaps May 2nd?
2018-04-05T16:12:22 <sepidehshahi> that works for me Justin_o
2018-04-05T16:12:33 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: great thanks, danayo  does that work for you as well?
2018-04-05T16:12:55 <danayo> May 2 sounds good. later in May gets busy
2018-04-05T16:12:58 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2018-04-05T16:13:37 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: thanks, i\'ll put it down for May 2nd.. if we remember maybe i or someone else can be assigned to take pictures if you need them for the guides
2018-04-05T16:14:01 <sepidehshahi> that would be great Justin_o
2018-04-05T16:16:27 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: np, please remind me the day or so before
2018-04-05T16:16:55 <sepidehshahi> for sure
2018-04-05T16:25:28 <danayo> sepidehshahi: would it be ok with you if we met at 1:15 about MyL3?
2018-04-05T16:26:05 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s ok for me danayo, simonjb can you meet at 1:15?

2018-04-05T16:43:18 <Caren_> colinclark: sepidehshahi, danayo this interview with Kat Holmes was in my Twitter feed. Mentions Inclusive Design as a a process and not a result. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6did you involve someone in your design process who was previously unable to participate? How you get there is what makes it inclusive, not that it\xe2\x80\x99s targeted at an underrepresented or underserved community.\xe2\x80\x9d

2018-04-05T20:08:15 <jhung> There is a right arrow you can use for play. There may be one for pause Justin_o
2018-04-05T20:08:38 <jhung> U+25B6 for right arrow
2018-04-05T20:09:32 <jhung> There\'s also U+2016 for "double vertical line"

2018-04-05T20:10:32 <Justin_o> emoji
2018-04-05T20:10:38 <Justin_o> i wonder if you can style those
2018-04-05T20:11:53 <Justin_o> https://codepen.io/kizu/pen/PzGadO
2018-04-05T20:14:52 <jhung> lol
2018-04-05T20:15:21 <Justin_o> looks like they\'re just applying a filter on it though, so i guess you can\'t really do much styling
2018-04-05T20:15:39 <Justin_o> although they look more like ice cream with the different hues
