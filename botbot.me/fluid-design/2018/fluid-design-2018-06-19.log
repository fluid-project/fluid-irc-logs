2018-06-19T15:11:29 <jhung> neuralmilkhotel: alan can help upload it to the CDN once you have it.
2018-06-19T15:14:44 <jhung> danayo, I was thinking perhaps sunglasses might be an interesting alternative to a curb cut? Sunglasses were originally pieces of bone with slits and were originally used to aid in visibility and safety in very specific situations (i.e. hunting / spending time outside in the arctic).

2018-06-19T17:00:09 <sepidehshahi> simonjb, colinclark and danayo here is an interesting report recently released by OpenIDEO to reflect on their processes. They share similar challenges in their \xe2\x80\x98Prioritizing Inclusion\xe2\x80\x99 section, and I like the questions they post at the end of each section
