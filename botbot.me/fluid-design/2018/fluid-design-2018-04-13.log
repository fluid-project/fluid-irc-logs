2018-04-13T14:12:27 <jhung> alanharnum: Just a heads up, I was asked for more detailed Google Analytics for Our Doors are Open, and BIG IDeA. Is there a secure way to provide reports without giving away the keys to the Google account?
2018-04-13T14:15:31 <alanharnum> jhung: let me look into it, I believe there may be a way to set people up with access that can view the Analytics reports for particular sites
2018-04-13T14:15:55 <jhung> Thanks alanharnum.
2018-04-13T14:16:16 <alanharnum> jhung: I suspect the answer probably lies in here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702?hl=en
2018-04-13T14:18:40 <jhung> alanharnum: ah. So it looks like we need to set up users, put them into a "View Analytics" group, and give them Read & Analyze permissions.
2018-04-13T14:20:17 <alanharnum> jhung: yeah, I think that should do it
