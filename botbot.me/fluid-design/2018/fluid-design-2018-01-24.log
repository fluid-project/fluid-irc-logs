2018-01-24T16:52:08 <Caren_> apologies! missed standup because I was on skype with Rod McDonald talking type and the issue with the Infusion font conversion. My update: was ill end of last week. Yesterday I sat in on the crit (great great tool SJRK folks!). This morning I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking care of some admin items along with investigating Fusion icon challenges. Tomorrow I will be up at York for Inclusion Day 2018.
2018-01-24T16:53:37 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: were there other icons besides the magnifying glass and the circle/+ in the library that were rendering incorrectly when transfered over to a glyph?
2018-01-24T16:58:33 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: we\xe2\x80\x99ve got different results everytime we tried to generate icons. That makes it even more difficult to detect the issue. The magnifier icon was broken in all attempts. Other broken icons in different attempts were the speech bubbles, caption, + and X buttons, hazard triangle, language, and some others.
2018-01-24T16:59:47 <Caren_> both the magnifying glass and circle/+ don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be grouped in the Object menu. Wondering if this might be the problem. Seems simple but I believe grouping has to be checked off.
2018-01-24T17:01:31 <danayo> Caren_: thanks for the positive feedback :)
2018-01-24T17:02:00 <Caren_> I think all the others you mentioned above also don\xe2\x80\x99t have Group selected in the object menu. Fingers crossed this is the solution \xe2\x80\xa6 eep
2018-01-24T17:04:01 <Caren_> danayo: it is really an exciting tool. Cal\xe2\x80\x99s class does a \xe2\x80\x9cmorning  minute\xe2\x80\x9d writing exercise that this would be amazing for\xe2\x80\xa6so many uses. I like the idea that it remain simple in it\xe2\x80\x99s interface and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become over complex in choice :-)
2018-01-24T17:05:32 <danayo> very cool Caren_ - yes we really want it to be useable in lots of different ways and by anyone
2018-01-24T17:05:39 <danayo> I think I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do a morning minute too :)
2018-01-24T17:07:28 <Caren_> ya, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a great format\xe2\x80\xa6gets them writing without feeling overwhelmed. By naming it with a short time frame I think it feels less daunting.
2018-01-24T17:08:06 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: I think all the other icons you mentioned above also don\xe2\x80\x99t have Group selected in the object menu. Fingers crossed this is the solution \xe2\x80\xa6 eep
2018-01-24T17:16:50 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: thanks for looking into it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the grouping in the object menu. I hope that solves the problem
2018-01-24T17:26:27 <danayo> sepidehshahi, Caren_: I know in the past I had to really mess with expanding the shapes and then subtracting one shape from another - I noticed some of the icons in the file still seem to have multiple parts to them. Maybe grouping will be enough, if not, I tried subracting the top image from the bottom (for the magnifier) and I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now. That might help too
2018-01-24T17:28:48 <Caren_> danayo: oh, yes, I think that is sure to help if not solve the issue.
2018-01-24T17:29:08 <danayo> it\xe2\x80\x99s SUPER finicky
2018-01-24T17:29:52 <danayo> but I noticed that if I selected both the top and bottom shape and selected the Minus Front option from Pathfinder, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, but if I selected ONLY the top shape and did it, it seemed to work :p
2018-01-24T17:30:14 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to create icons now in Icomoon and see what happens
2018-01-24T17:30:23 <danayo> sepidehshahi, Caren_ ^
2018-01-24T17:31:05 <Caren_> yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s an idea\xe2\x80\xa6was just reading about that
2018-01-24T17:33:20 <sepidehshahi> thank you both danayo and Caren_ I have merged all shapes in pathfinder. so there should be only one single shape in the master file. However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the group object option as well to see what happens
2018-01-24T17:34:29 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi
2018-01-24T17:35:23 <Caren_> danayo sepidehshahi: I have found that sketching/exploring in illustrator and then using that sketch file as a final can be problematic because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid attention to how I\xe2\x80\x99ve built something. And how it\xe2\x80\x99s built can effect the final output\xe2\x80\xa6especially in digital. Groan
2018-01-24T17:35:38 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I just checked in the file and it looks like the magnifier is still multiple parts

2018-01-24T17:37:36 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I took these steps: group the white shapes (the inner triangle and inner circle area), then select the grouped white shape, then option-click Minus Front from pathfinder
2018-01-24T17:38:02 <danayo> be sure to select the grouped white shape only
2018-01-24T17:38:20 <danayo> oh crud hang on
2018-01-24T17:38:31 <danayo> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that actually worked!
2018-01-24T17:39:07 <danayo> oh man
2018-01-24T17:39:12 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-01-24T17:39:17 <sepidehshahi> danayo: could you please send me a link to the storytelling tool you shared in the design crit yesterday?
2018-01-24T17:39:45 <sepidehshahi> I know!! we tried so many different variations but the results were the same...
2018-01-24T17:40:21 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I do think if we can succeed in creating one shape it should be ok, it\xe2\x80\x99s just HOW to get it to be one single shape that seems to be tricky
2018-01-24T17:40:45 <danayo> sepidehshahi: mockups and notes are linked from design crit wiki page

2018-01-24T17:43:59 <Caren_> danayo sepidehshahi : are you using the masking tool to create one shape. So for example instead of layering a white x on a black circle you mask out the white x\xe2\x80\xa6does that makes sense?
2018-01-24T17:45:09 <danayo> Caren_: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t used the masking tool for creating icons - I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if masking is enough - because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually remove anything - but worth a try!
2018-01-24T17:46:41 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: for example, I create a solid black circle, then a white Plus shape. I overlay the white plus on the circle and then select both shapes > pathfinder and cut out/trim the plus from the circle. So at the end it\xe2\x80\x99s just a single shape, with only one layer.
2018-01-24T17:48:53 <danayo> sepidehshahi: which Pathfinder tool do you use?
2018-01-24T17:48:59 <danayo> Minus Front?
2018-01-24T17:49:03 <sepidehshahi> jhung: also recommended using shape maker/builder. in that case I overlay the shapes, select shape builder (shift+m) and then choose which parts I want to be removed. but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work either
2018-01-24T17:49:43 <sepidehshahi> yes danayo minus front
2018-01-24T17:49:58 <danayo> ok
2018-01-24T17:50:36 <danayo> sepidehshahi, Caren_, jhung, grrrero: do you know if there is any way to view your history of actions in Illustrator?
2018-01-24T17:50:47 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: the compound path maker might be successful. Black circle, black x (outline), select both then apply compound path
2018-01-24T17:51:15 <sepidehshahi> sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll try that as well
2018-01-24T17:51:49 * avtar joined the channel
2018-01-24T17:53:17 <Caren_> danayo: which icon are you trying break apart?
2018-01-24T17:54:01 <Caren_> is it possible there are layers you can see and then remove (under layer palette)
2018-01-24T17:55:08 <Caren_> danayo: ^
2018-01-24T17:56:43 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-24T17:57:50 <danayo> Caren_: the magnifier icon
2018-01-24T17:58:54 <danayo> I think it shows up as a singler layer
2018-01-24T17:59:10 <danayo> but I\xe2\x80\x99m still able to separately select the shapes
2018-01-24T17:59:37 <danayo> hmmm I wonder if locking the compound shapes would help?
2018-01-24T17:59:45 <danayo> compund path I mean
2018-01-24T18:00:41 <sepidehshahi> Caren_ I just checked the icons, they are already a compound path. Should I release the current compound path and create a new one?
2018-01-24T18:01:02 * alanharnum has quit
2018-01-24T18:02:50 <Caren_> danayo: I was suggesting Grouping the paths because it seems that the icons that are problematic haven\xe2\x80\x99t been grouped under the Object menu (I think). Is locking different from grouping?
2018-01-24T18:04:02 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: the icons may be corrupt if none of the other solutions work. So perhaps rebuilding may be necessary. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.
2018-01-24T18:05:03 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: you can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I have recreated the file twice!! still the same issue :)
2018-01-24T18:05:33 <Caren_> ugh sepidehshahi !!!
2018-01-24T18:06:08 <Caren_> do we know if the grouping of paths within each icon under the Object menu solves the issue?
2018-01-24T18:06:14 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: ^
2018-01-24T18:07:05 <sepidehshahi> no worries, Justin will be in the office tomorrow and we will figure something out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the grouping of path tomorrow and give the updated file to Justin. hopefully that solves the issue
2018-01-24T18:07:23 <sepidehshahi> thanks a lot Caren_ and danayo for trying :)
2018-01-24T18:08:46 <Caren_> I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple fix (at this point) sepidehshahi. Group for the win! :-)
2018-01-24T18:09:26 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: is it object > group?
2018-01-24T18:11:11 <Caren_> yes. And it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a global grouping of paths but rather the path content of each art board should be grouped individually. If that makes sense?

2018-01-24T18:13:47 <sepidehshahi> yes. I just came across something interesting. I tried object > shape > convert to shape. for some of the icons that are problematic when I try to turn them into a shape, it gives me an error message saying : objects are not converted to shape
2018-01-24T18:14:02 <sepidehshahi> danayo: and Caren_ that might be the issue ^
2018-01-24T18:18:27 <danayo> interesting sepidehshahi
2018-01-24T18:18:56 <danayo> Caren_: to your earlier question - I think locking might just be a superficial thing - as in, it just locks the image from editing but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter the imate

2018-01-24T18:25:34 <Caren_> sepidehshahi: oh, wow, I thought the icons needed to be paths and not shapes. So I wonder if by applying compound path one cannot then convert the graphic to a shape.
2018-01-24T18:26:35 <Caren_> danayo: ah, ok. the same locking I use when I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to inadvertently move something on the art board!
2018-01-24T18:26:42 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: I tried releasing the path and then converting to shape. I still get the error message. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out why I can\xe2\x80\x99t convert particular objects to shape

2018-01-24T18:41:26 <grrrero> danayo: I don't think there is :(
2018-01-24T18:41:47 <grrrero> danayo: Did some quick googling and it seems any sort of history tracking in Illustrator CC doesn't exist? :(
2018-01-24T18:52:09 <grrrero> jhung: Got a question for you jhung -- if I split the sidebar.php into sidebar-page.php and sidebar-page.php -- does it go back to the a11y parent theme to retrieve a sidebar.php since it no longer exists in my theme?
2018-01-24T18:53:47 <jhung> Yes grrrero. There's a look-up order for sidebar.php in themes. If it doesn't find it in the child, it then looks in the parent.
2018-01-24T18:53:54 <grrrero> Ahhhhh
2018-01-24T18:53:59 <grrrero> That answers it
2018-01-24T18:54:01 <grrrero> Thanks jhung
