2018-04-04T15:03:38 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo, I cut out several images from different magazines for the functional mash up activity. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to add any objects to the deck please send me their images. thx
2018-04-04T15:04:34 <danayo> great sepidehshahi!
2018-04-04T15:04:34 <danayo> thanks
2018-04-04T15:04:44 <sepidehshahi> np
2018-04-04T15:08:04 <michelled> danayo: I think we should update the 'activity' page of the sjrk site in the next couple weeks
2018-04-04T15:08:06 <danayo> do you think we have enough now sepidehshahi ? if not I will finfd some more
2018-04-04T15:09:15 <jhung> grrrero: I left some comments in the refactoring PR.
2018-04-04T15:09:28 <danayo> ok michelled, I can put something together and maybe run it by the partners before addign
2018-04-04T15:09:39 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I think we have enough cards for 3 groups and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be more than 10 people in the office today\xe2\x80\xa6 so I think we should be fine
2018-04-04T15:09:47 <danayo> ok
2018-04-04T15:10:36 <michelled> sounds good danayo
2018-04-04T15:11:33 <sepidehshahi> The only thing that I am concern about is that most of these objects that I have found already have a function like glasses, bags, chairs, etc. and they are not random shapes. do you think this is ok danayo?
2018-04-04T15:11:59 <danayo> I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea sepidehshahi, at least as I understood it
2018-04-04T15:12:04 <danayo> recognizable objects
2018-04-04T15:12:10 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-04-04T15:12:15 <sepidehshahi> great! so we should be fine
2018-04-04T15:12:25 <danayo> yes
2018-04-04T15:13:42 <danayo> I think the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional mashup\xe2\x80\x9d is exactly that sepidehshahi - individual objects with their own function, \xe2\x80\x9cmashed\xe2\x80\x9d together to create a new function
2018-04-04T15:14:06 <sepidehshahi> cool! so let\xe2\x80\x99s see how it goes :)
2018-04-04T15:15:12 <danayo> :)
