2018-06-13T15:12:54 <simonjb> I like the storytelling with maps and the ability to project layers on top of the map to make connections with current and historic data

2018-06-13T15:48:08 <alanharnum> jessm: gmoss and I talked about that quickly on the standup this morning, I think we can block some time tomorrow to review - do you have links immediately at hand for the repos?

2018-06-13T15:53:13 <jessm> everyone: my standup update is that kevin stolarick and i gave a JT preso yesterday on D&I to folks at Ryerson Ted Rogers school of mgmt. it went really well and someone from Centennial wanted to connect afterwards (which is nice) Jutta has been pushing to make connections for life long learning lab with area colleges and univ. I met with some folks at Mohawk late last week e.g. also just spent some time re-connectng
2018-06-13T15:53:41 <jessm> with GSOCers and am catching up on some to-dos for presos with OMA and with MAESD for Friday
2018-06-13T15:54:03 <jessm> vidyo convo this afternoon

2018-06-13T16:06:06 <Caren_> I had to miss standup, here is my update: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting some time into Inclusive Cities Monday, Tuesday therefore will be offline in the later part of the week. The co-design toolkits are coming along really nicely and the teachers are excited to have their classes take part in the co-design. Great work lead by Sepideh. Have been also working on SNOW content and an unintentional mascot or sorts: SNOWy the owl
2018-06-13T16:06:06 <Caren_> used an owl (stock art) on some one-off pamphlets for an event and it had positive reactions. I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure how it could be used on the site\xe2\x80\xa6maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll send out an email to the team for some feedback. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be offline from 2:30 onward for meetings and will reconnect with Inclusive Cities late afternoon early evening.
2018-06-13T16:08:50 <Caren_> jessm: not sure this is relevant to Life Long Learning Lab: The Sheridan Centre for Elder Research\t"We provide a unique environment for conducting applied research into areas of practical concern and immediate relevance to older adults and their families. We develop innovative approaches and creative interdisciplinary partnerships that focus on enhancing the lives of older Canadians."\t

2018-06-13T16:22:12 <sepidehshahi> Caren_: lliskovoi has a phone call in the afternoon, so maybe we could meet after that, around 3:00?
