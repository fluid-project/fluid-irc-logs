2018-01-17T16:24:25 <danayo> my standup update: yesterday - crit and planning meetings, met with alanharnum and gmoss to finish tasking for the storytelling tool, met with sepidehshahi to talk about the MyL3 designs, worked on some changes to the storytelling tool designs based on tasking discussions. Today - working on storytelling mockups particularly story viewing, searching, browsing as well as the Floe microsite design, and (hopefully!) joining community meeting

2018-01-17T17:45:29 <danayo> hi jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk about the storytelling tool designs at next week\xe2\x80\x99s crit if possible
2018-01-17T17:46:45 <jhung> danayo: that should work. Currently nothing is planned.
2018-01-17T17:46:56 <danayo> ok great, I\xe2\x80\x99ll add it to the wiki

2018-01-17T17:55:18 <sepidehshahi> hi danayo and carenwatkins: do you know by any chance which typeface we are using for UIO icons, e.g. \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99? all fonts are converted to outlines, so I\xe2\x80\x99m unable to detect the type and we need that for some of the new icons we are creating.
2018-01-17T17:55:43 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung, sepidehshahi: Do we have the svgs or ai files for the glyphs used in the uploader icon font https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/src/components/uploader/fonts
2018-01-17T17:56:15 * gtirloni_ is now known as gtirloni
2018-01-17T17:56:26 <jhung> Justin_o: let me see...
2018-01-17T17:56:59 <danayo> hmmm sepidehshahi, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, wonder if carenwatkins can tell by looking?
2018-01-17T17:58:06 <jhung> Justin_o:  I found some. Let me move it into OwnCloud.
2018-01-17T17:58:07 * alanharnum has quit
2018-01-17T17:58:47 <danayo> sepidehshahi: there might be an original file in dropbox somewhere, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t access it right now
2018-01-17T17:59:09 <sepidehshahi> no worries danayo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into the dropbox
2018-01-17T17:59:32 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi, thanks, let me know if you have any questions about what you find there!
2018-01-17T17:59:54 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks

2018-01-17T18:02:32 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2018-01-17T18:05:15 <sepidehshahi> hi jhung: can you please send a link to those documents to me as well?. Maybe I can find the original files there.
2018-01-17T18:05:36 <jhung> sepidehshahi, Justin_o: Check under IDRC-Design > Projects > Infusion
2018-01-17T18:05:46 <sepidehshahi> sure, thx
2018-01-17T18:05:50 <jhung> I copied over directories I found in dropbox.
2018-01-17T18:08:10 <jhung> sepidehshahi: There are UIO Icons located in IDRC-Design > Projects > UIO in dropbox.
2018-01-17T18:08:20 <jhung> *sorry I mean Owncloud.
2018-01-17T18:09:27 <sepidehshahi> yes jhung, unfortunately they are all SVGs and there is no ai file
2018-01-17T18:12:15 <jhung> It's possible we worked from SVGs for that sepidehshahi. I recall a time when we tried to do work using SVGs as much as possible.

2018-01-17T18:35:19 <jhung> grrrero: I've been banging my head against a particularly annoying bug in the way the Sidebar is generated. The problem is there's no way for the sidebar to know which category the user intended to display if a post belongs to more than 1 category.
2018-01-17T18:35:39 <jhung> I've documented the issue here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-533
2018-01-17T18:36:13 <jhung> For now I'm not going to spend more time trying to figure out a fix. For now I will implement a work-around to avoid the issue.
2018-01-17T18:36:17 * danayo has quit
2018-01-17T18:36:25 <grrrero> jhung: Looking at it now
2018-01-17T18:36:41 <jhung> In the SNOW site, you might run into the same issue as well if a post belongs to more than 1 category.
2018-01-17T18:37:09 <grrrero> jhung: Yeah I can see how that would happen :\\
2018-01-17T18:38:30 <grrrero> Do you have a branch that you're working off of?
2018-01-17T18:39:50 <jhung> grrrero: I'm just working locally right now. I'll stuff my experimentation into a FLOE-533 branch and come back to it later if it needs to be addressed.
2018-01-17T18:40:04 <grrrero> Ok jhung, let me know if there's any way I can assist
2018-01-17T18:40:27 <grrrero> Don't bang your head too hard :)
2018-01-17T18:40:45 <jhung> grrrero: Thanks! Nothing right now. I was just letting you know about the bug in case you run into it as well.
2018-01-17T18:41:13 * jhung puts on helmet
2018-01-17T18:41:14 <grrrero> jhung: Thanks for the heads up, we're probably going to need to mention that in the manual if it's not fixed by then :\\

2018-01-17T18:41:31 <jhung> lol

2018-01-17T18:41:49 <jhung> yes definitely grrrero.
