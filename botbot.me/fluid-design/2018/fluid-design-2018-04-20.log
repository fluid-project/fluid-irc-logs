2018-04-20T15:23:48 <jessm> everyone: going to miss standup today -- my day is continuing to dig into and out of follow-ups from the summit and earlier this week. Also, JT has asked me to get planning our birthday party for this coming DEEP. Who doesn\'t love a party?! So, I\'ll be diving into that too

Yesterday evening, finished the Sensibill review, talked to Caren and Eloisa about SNOW and created a background pattern for the site. Today starting another accessibility audit, and have a few calls with potential clients.

2018-04-20T16:54:40 <jhung> Something "funny" happened to the Presentations page on the wiki. Some of the links don\'t go to their proper spots anymore.
2018-04-20T16:55:01 <jhung> For example your SolidWorks presentation doesn\'t link to the presentation anymore jessm.

2018-04-20T17:46:26 <jhung> A couple other links on the page are like that too. Not sure what happened jessm

2018-04-20T17:48:59 <jessm> jhung: are all the links to outside sites broken and only internal pointers work?
2018-04-20T17:49:16 <jessm> i mean, i guess it doesn\'t matter why it\'s broken...
2018-04-20T17:49:34 <jhung> I\'m not sure jessm. Not sure which links were meant to link to a local file or a remote one.
2018-04-20T17:50:02 <jhung> jessm: i.e. was your SolidWorks link supposed to go to an external source?
2018-04-20T17:50:14 <jhung> I wonder if it had something to do with a wiki update?
2018-04-20T17:50:18 <jessm> jhung: i think it might have
2018-04-20T17:50:25 <jessm> jhung: honestly i don\'t know
2018-04-20T17:50:35 <jessm> ok, i\'ll add it to my rainy day list :P
2018-04-20T17:50:55 <jessm> and since it basically rains all the time...
2018-04-20T17:51:13 <jhung> lol
2018-04-20T17:54:11 <jhung> something really odd too\xe2\x80\xa6 looks like the history log is wrong too. The history lost its links too
2018-04-20T18:02:40 <jessm> what is happening with that? jhung did you ping gtirloni about any of this?
2018-04-20T18:03:10 <jhung> jessm: will do.

2018-04-20T18:49:15 <gtirloni> jessm: do you have a link to the inclusive design 101 at solidworks presentation?
2018-04-20T18:54:19 <gtirloni> jessm jhung: I think this described the issue (we have collaborative editing enabled): https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-46227?src=confmacro
2018-04-20T18:55:02 <gtirloni> i tried disabling it but it seems the damage is permanent. I\'ve opened a support ticket and will wait for Atlassian. Some links are working but a lot of them seem to have been lost
2018-04-20T18:57:26 <jhung> gtirloni: yikes. That sounds bad. Thanks for looking into it gtirloni!

2018-04-20T19:05:39 <janardan> jessm: sry for the late reply, but we were doing a meeting with me rutvi and yehchan
2018-04-20T19:10:31 <jessm> janardan: where can i catch up on what you 3 are doing?
2018-04-20T19:10:55 <janardan> jessm: we can update you on what we did on our mettings, we added everything to the google docs
2018-04-20T19:11:02 <janardan> jessm: we can also talk in person as well

2018-04-20T19:17:17 <jessm> janardan: rutvi: y* I see you\'ve put in some notes re: the games we asked you to look at
2018-04-20T19:17:42 <jessm> and have you started on the narrative/quest?
2018-04-20T19:17:47 <jessm> do you have the story of the game drafted?
2018-04-20T19:17:58 <janardan> we are doing the story of the game right now
2018-04-20T19:18:19 <jessm> oh great!
2018-04-20T19:18:35 <janardan> we saw that they like creation games
2018-04-20T19:18:45 <janardan> and so we wanted to create something with creation and cards combined together
2018-04-20T19:19:02 <janardan> so right now we are thinking of themes, plus how we show this theme in our work
2018-04-20T19:22:09 <jessm> janardan: ok, good
2018-04-20T19:22:26 <jessm> janardan: rutvi  have you run into anything that is a blocker -- something you can\'t get past?
2018-04-20T19:23:36 <rutvi> jessm, nothing really right now, but i feel that we will when we start putting the game together
2018-04-20T19:24:22 <rutvi> bc we have a good idea about what we\'re doing with the switch, and where we want the story line to go
2018-04-20T19:24:33 <jessm> rutvi: ok. well, if you get stuck, ping one of us and keep organizing your google doc so it\'ll make sense to you and to us! it\'s a great way to practice iterating and also get a bit of a timeline with key points in it
2018-04-20T19:25:11 <rutvi> jessm, ok I\'ll work on that, and thank you
2018-04-20T19:25:23 <jessm> thank you!

2018-04-20T19:35:55 <janardan> oh is the question for me too jessm
2018-04-20T19:36:33 <jessm> janardan: it\'s for all 3 of you though i don\'t see yechan here
2018-04-20T19:36:43 <janardan> oh
2018-04-20T19:36:53 <janardan> ill tell yehchan to go on
2018-04-20T19:37:12 <janardan> and for a blocker i guess is that everytime we think of an idea, we just get a lot more questions than answers
2018-04-20T19:37:33 <jessm> hahahha, janardan you just described life!
2018-04-20T19:37:35 <janardan> for some topics we got to the points where we had solid answers, but for some others, we still have questions unsolved
2018-04-20T19:37:41 <janardan> thats true
2018-04-20T19:38:07 <jessm> janardan: why don\'t you all structure your google doc so it\'s clear what your remaining, unanswered questions are and then we can comment on them
2018-04-20T19:38:10 * YehchanP joined the channel
2018-04-20T19:38:42 <janardan> we bolded all the questions and we have them up top
2018-04-20T19:38:52 <janardan> i think im going to put where they belong
2018-04-20T19:39:50 <alanharnum> janardan YehchanP rutvi: this document is great!
2018-04-20T19:40:03 <janardan> thank you
2018-04-20T19:40:24 <janardan> do u want the actual document on ur gmail so you can see it any time rather than sending links over again?
2018-04-20T19:42:37 <alanharnum> I\'ve added it to my Drive
2018-04-20T19:42:50 <janardan> oh alright then
2018-04-20T19:42:56 <alanharnum> what would be great is if you could give me Comment ability so I can leave feedback
