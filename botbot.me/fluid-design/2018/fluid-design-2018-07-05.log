2018-07-05T17:46:20 <carenwatkins> hi g2szeto for some reason your email address bounced back to me. Here is the link to the medium articles I mentioned: https://medium.com/@jutta.trevira/the-three-dimensions-of-inclusive-design-part-one-103cad1ffdc2

2018-07-05T18:23:24 <jhung> Awesome. TTYT!
2018-07-05T18:38:22 <carenwatkins> Does anyone know if there is a change of term from \xe2\x80\x9cassistive technology\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9caccessible information technlogoy\xe2\x80\x9d, or if the two mean something different? Possibly AODA driven?
2018-07-05T18:38:52 <carenwatkins> * accessible information technology

2018-07-05T19:48:50 <michelled> colinclark, danayo: are we meeting now?
2018-07-05T19:49:17 <colinclark> oh yes, we scheduled a follow up
2018-07-05T19:49:26 <colinclark> I guess it depends on what you and danayo think
2018-07-05T19:49:31 <colinclark> I could go either way
2018-07-05T19:49:47 <michelled> alan sent us his map
2018-07-05T19:50:00 <michelled> danayo I think said she'd been working on other projects
2018-07-05T19:50:04 <danayo> colinclark, michelled: I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to work on the map
2018-07-05T19:50:09 <danayo> but it is top of my list
2018-07-05T19:50:12 <michelled> so we could just wait until next week?
2018-07-05T19:50:17 <colinclark> that'd be fine with me
2018-07-05T19:50:35 <danayo> works for me michelled, colinclark
2018-07-05T19:51:04 <michelled> let's assume same time and check with Alan when he's back?
2018-07-05T19:51:26 <danayo> sure michelled
2018-07-05T19:51:47 <danayo> did you see this article colinclark? https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Data_Society_Beyond_Disruption_FINAL.pdf
2018-07-05T19:51:48 <michelled> oh wait! I just realized colinclark that you'd wanted something drawn up before the meeting on the 10th
2018-07-05T19:52:12 <michelled> so maybe we meet on the 9th?
2018-07-05T19:52:18 <danayo> for loconomics?
2018-07-05T19:52:24 <colinclark> oh, yes
2018-07-05T19:52:25 <danayo> or is it the meeting in chicago on the 20th?
2018-07-05T19:52:34 <colinclark> that'll be more technical roadmap stuff anyway
2018-07-05T19:52:46 <colinclark> but the 9th does sound like a good time to talk again
2018-07-05T19:53:16 <danayo> colinclark: what were you hoping to have by the 10th?
2018-07-05T19:54:08 <colinclark> some idea of our plans for the next six months in terms of design and development of the labour platform
2018-07-05T19:55:50 <danayo> ok
2018-07-05T19:56:24 <michelled> does 3:30 on the 9th work?
2018-07-05T19:56:35 <danayo> just wondering what you hope to see by Monday ...
2018-07-05T19:56:38 <colinclark> does for me
2018-07-05T19:56:45 <colinclark> 12:30 your time, danayo
