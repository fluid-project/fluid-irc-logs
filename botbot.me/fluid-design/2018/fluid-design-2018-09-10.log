2018-09-10T13:51:18 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi, jhung: I'm adding a word-spacing preference for FLUID-6333. I'm looking in the Infusion-Icons repo ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/tree/master/svg ) and see icons for the  condensed and expanded word-spacing, but not for the preference itself. See character-spacing and line-spacing for examples. Or should i just use one of the expanded or condensed icons for the presence too?
