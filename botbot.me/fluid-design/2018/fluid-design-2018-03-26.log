2018-03-26T15:26:21 <jhung> I had it put down for the 27th. We can move it to the 3rd if not everyone can make it sepidehshahi.

2018-03-26T15:54:12 <Justin_o> danayo and sepidehshahi: We have to reschedule our community meeting on April 4th. I wonder if you would be interested in using that time to go through the guide activities with the group?
2018-03-26T15:56:15 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: it\xe2\x80\x99s good idea, however, Jutta has not reviewed some of those activitie yet
2018-03-26T16:02:26 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: ah okay... no worries then
2018-03-26T16:03:27 <danayo> Justin_o, sepidehshahi, I wonder though - it might still be worth trying them. maybe if we let her know we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it she\xe2\x80\x99ll find the time to describe a few more activities to us :)
2018-03-26T16:03:36 <sepidehshahi> danayo: what to do think? should we try them out or wait for Jutta\xe2\x80\x99s edits? ^

2018-03-26T16:09:32 <sepidehshahi> :) danayo let\xe2\x80\x99s try them then
2018-03-26T16:09:42 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi - it will be fun :)

2018-03-26T22:09:45 <danayo> fluid-everyone: thought this was a really interesting narrative visualization - about the Kinder-Morgan Trans-Mountain pipeline https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/kinder-morgan-trans-mountain-pipeline-bc-coast/article35043172/
2018-03-26T22:10:01 <danayo> would be great to include sound and TTS
2018-03-26T22:20:30 <gmoss> danayo: that was very cool! and yes, I agree that it would have benefited from the addition of some ambient audio and narration
