2018-09-17T15:48:56 <colinclark> i'm excited to try it out!

2018-09-17T16:32:31 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung_away I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to find the icons under Projects > UIO > UIO Icon > UIOPlus_Icon_Word_Spacing_V1_JH.ai, could you please share that file with me
2018-09-17T16:41:35 <jhung_away> sepidehshahi: That's strange. It should have the default permissions. I've now shared it explicitly with the IDRC group. Let me know if you can see it now.

2018-09-17T17:06:27 <sepidehshahi> I have trouble connecting to Owncloud so maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why it is not syncing the files properly.
2018-09-17T17:06:35 <sepidehshahi> jhung: ^
2018-09-17T17:07:12 <sepidehshahi> can you send me the file or a link to the file so I can have a look at it until I get my owncloud fixed

2018-09-17T17:36:02 <sepidehshahi> Thanks jhung, I think they look really great and Justin_o should be able to integrate them. I really like the one with three blocks, it clearly shows the function
2018-09-17T17:43:56 <jhung> Awesome sepidehshahi. :)
2018-09-17T17:44:33 <jhung> Justin_o: I'll get an SVG version pushed up to the icons repo.
2018-09-17T19:08:55 <jhung> Justin_o: PR for new word spacing icons https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/pull/6
2018-09-17T19:19:53 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2018-09-17T19:28:28 <jhung> Justin_o: argh. Newbie mistake.
2018-09-17T19:28:42 <jhung> I didn't realize I even committed it.
2018-09-17T19:30:15 <Justin_o> jhung: what happened?
2018-09-17T19:30:41 <jhung> I committed the package-lock.json file?
2018-09-17T19:31:07 <Justin_o> jhung: oh i don't know.. we've recently decided not to commit those files so we are opportunistically removing them and adding them to the gitignore
2018-09-17T19:31:32 <jhung> Justin_o: ah ok. So it may not have been me. *phew*. :D
