2018-01-29T15:29:41 <sepidehshahi> Hi alanharnum, thanks for creating the fluid resources macro. I have used it to add several links and it works really well!
2018-01-29T15:29:41 * jhung joined the channel
2018-01-29T15:30:35 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: great! it\'s a pretty easy process to create the macros, so if there\'s other things that would be useful that come to mind please let me know
2018-01-29T15:35:03 <sepidehshahi> fore sure. So far it has been very easy and clear
2018-01-29T15:37:26 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: is it possible to create a list of tags to choose from or somehow unify our tagging system, so later on it would be easier to search for a specific content or find related contents? or should I follow a specific process for tagging?
2018-01-29T15:46:43 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: we could do that (it\'s possible for a macro to let you pick one or multiple items from a selection list), but at that point i think we might be edging a little into "rebuild Zotero using Confluence macros" territory
2018-01-29T15:47:39 <alanharnum> what i\'d suggest for now is that we decide and document things that might be ambiguous about using tags - how do we refer to our projects, FE, are tags capitalized, etc
2018-01-29T15:48:23 <sepidehshahi> sure alanharnum

2018-01-29T18:11:46 <Justin_o> jhung: i guess it depends on if i get my test page for the syllabification done
2018-01-29T18:11:55 <Justin_o> if i do, i\'d like to talk over the options for that
2018-01-29T18:12:25 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. Sounds good. I\'ll put that down.

2018-01-29T18:22:56 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: I just realized there are two more icons that we\'ll need
2018-01-29T18:23:22 <Justin_o> for letter-space, like line space, there are the icons that go on either side of the stepper
2018-01-29T18:24:00 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right Justin_o. I\xe2\x80\x99ll add them to the file right now
2018-01-29T18:24:02 <Justin_o> so for line-space we have line-space-condensed and line-sapce-expanded.. we\'ll need something like this for letter spacing too
2018-01-29T18:24:05 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks

2018-01-29T19:03:55 <Justin_o> jhung: could you please review this PR to update the Infusion-Icons repo https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-icons/pull/3
2018-01-29T19:04:18 <Justin_o> it updates the repo to use the new icons that sepidehshahi created
2018-01-29T19:06:00 <jhung> Justin_o: sure. I have a few things I need to get off my plate and then I can take a look.
