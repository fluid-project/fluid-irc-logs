2018-02-01T16:48:45 <danayo> my update:  re: SJRK this morning I came across and was reading through a First Nations Youth Action Plan from Ontario called Feathers of Hope- looks like And Also Too worked with them on an updated one in 2016, this one is from 2014: http://cwrp.ca/sites/default/files/publications/en/Feathers_of_Hope.pdf
2018-02-01T16:49:39 <danayo> today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to focus on the storytelling tool and microsite designs, also will need to start doing some background reading about blockchain in prep for meeting with RChain.

2018-02-01T16:53:14 <carenwatkins> everyone: apologies for missing standup. Was in a final SNOW transfer-of-info meeting with Julia. This afternoon includes a meeting with grrrero to review the new SNOW site (exciting!), and possibly dive back into PhET. Tomorrow I plan to focus on PhET.
2018-02-01T16:53:16 <alanharnum> danayo, colinclark, this is the project I was thinking of: https://www.comicbookcontracts.com/
2018-02-01T16:53:25 <alanharnum> there's an article about it here: http://theconversation.com/comic-contracts-and-other-ways-to-make-the-law-understandable-90313
2018-02-01T16:53:42 <danayo> cool thanks alanharnum
2018-02-01T16:55:57 <alanharnum> this one is interesting as well: https://medium.com/paper-modern-contract-lifecycle-management/cartoon-contracts-welcome-to-the-wild-world-of-legal-information-design-fdd73af926e8
2018-02-01T16:56:27 <alanharnum> and is broadly about using graphics as part of making contracts more understandable

2018-02-01T18:07:03 <jhung> alanharnum: re: accessibility.cloud access - I don't have an account. Maybe emailing Holger would fast track this. Feel free to CC me on that. I've been in touch with him.
