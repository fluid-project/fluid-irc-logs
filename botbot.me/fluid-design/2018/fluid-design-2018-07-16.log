2018-07-16T15:22:04 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung, is there a posibility that we use some of the design crit time tomorrow to talk about our co-design activities for the Sidewalk project?
2018-07-16T15:22:59 <jhung> sepidehshahi: There might be. Avtar is running the topic tomorrow but he is away today.
2018-07-16T15:24:44 <sepidehshahi> sure, thanks jhung.
2018-07-16T15:26:41 <sepidehshahi> jhung: can we use the next week\xe2\x80\x99s design crit to talk about the co-design activities?

2018-07-16T17:57:05 <clown> makes sense gmoss
2018-07-16T17:57:25 <jhung> gmoss: it just passed up here. I walked through 2 inches of rain water.
2018-07-16T17:57:59 <michelled> wow!
2018-07-16T17:58:01 <gmoss> jhung: Holy cow! Well that means it won\'t be too long a storm, I guess :)
2018-07-16T17:58:18 <michelled> it\'s already clouding over down here
2018-07-16T17:58:38 <jhung> *2 inches in the gutter.
2018-07-16T17:59:13 <jhung> Good luck GTA. :)

2018-07-16T18:13:19 <jhung> michelled: perfect, thanks for letting me know.
2018-07-16T18:13:20 <michelled> danayo: maybe a few minutes after? I\'ll ping you?

2018-07-16T18:21:11 <jessm> everyone: the ILDH "show topics" isn\'t working for me -- there is nothing there
2018-07-16T18:21:28 <danayo> are you on the intro page jessm
2018-07-16T18:22:23 <danayo> jessm I think I create a JIRA to fix that - there are no topics for the Introduction
2018-07-16T18:22:46 <danayo> so I dont\' think it should have the show topics option, or we need some other solution
2018-07-16T18:23:36 <jessm> ah danayo it is on the main page
2018-07-16T18:23:58 <danayo> sorry yes the home page
2018-07-16T18:24:00 <danayo> not the intro
2018-07-16T18:24:06 <danayo> although the intro only has one topic
2018-07-16T18:24:33 <danayo> jessm ^

2018-07-16T18:26:29 <danayo> jhung, sepidehshahi ^
2018-07-16T18:27:47 <jhung> danayo: yeah. The home page does not have any topics, so it\'s just empty.
2018-07-16T18:30:06 <jhung> danayo: there are a couple ways of fixing it. I can take a look at it later this week.

2018-07-16T19:45:50 <simonjb> sepidehshahi, g2szeto, Hassany2: I\'ve added a section to the bottom of the email draft Google doc for preparing a response to the email we discussed

2018-07-16T20:46:56 <colinclark> danayo, michelled, have you seen this new video yet? https://vimeo.com/280102634
2018-07-16T20:47:26 <danayo> had not colinclark! thansk
2018-07-16T20:50:38 <michelled> cool! thx colinclark
2018-07-16T20:58:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i wonder if you have a suggestion. I need to create an instance of the YT.Player. Which is used to control embedded YouTube videos. I\'m trying to assign the player as a member on a component and interact with it through events and invokers. Most of the time it works, but sometimes the YouTube api hasn\'t finished loading before it gets triggered. You can create a global function that will get called when the API
2018-07-16T20:58:42 <Justin_o> is ready, so it is possible to get a notification. However, I\'m guessing this won\'t allow me to use an expander to create the member.
2018-07-16T20:59:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - with the current framework, you\'ll have to use the standard approaches that we currently do to deal with asynchrony
2018-07-16T20:59:44 <Bosmon> As we do in UIO for example
2018-07-16T21:00:14 <Bosmon> The components which are asynchronous will need to be put at the top of the tree together with any other IO, and create a "rollup event" that waits for them all to be done, and then constructs the rest of the tree that depends on them
2018-07-16T21:00:58 <Justin_o> so those components are already being created with a DOM driven dynamicComponent
2018-07-16T21:01:09 <Justin_o> as it needs to find the existing YouTube video iframes.
2018-07-16T21:02:01 <Justin_o> I guess instead i could wait to see if the YouTube api is present and fire an event for each video element afterwards
2018-07-16T21:02:09 <Justin_o> does that make sense, or is there a better way to combine those
2018-07-16T21:02:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2018-07-16T21:02:20 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-07-16T21:02:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m not clear what contextual information you require in order to construct this instance
2018-07-16T21:02:57 <Bosmon> Is it housed in a DOM which has already been constructed by a previously instantiated Infusion component?
2018-07-16T21:04:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well i\'m trying to bind their api to an existing embedded video, instead of injecting the video myself. https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference?csw=1#Example_Video_Player_Constructors
2018-07-16T21:05:27 <Justin_o> also unlike that example i\'m not planning on injecting the script, but will require it to be provided in the head already
2018-07-16T21:06:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so you could indeed determine where the embedded video is without having constructed your whole application?
2018-07-16T21:06:49 <Justin_o> so i\'m writing a component that finds all the youtube videos, using a simple selector. It creates dynamic sub components for each found video which sets the "enablejsapi=1" query parameter if needed on the videos source , and creates an instance of the YT.Player for the video
2018-07-16T21:07:08 <Bosmon> ok
2018-07-16T21:08:08 <Bosmon> This is a kind of pattern that I think colinclark has run into before, but we don\'t have a particularly convenient pattern for dealing with it
2018-07-16T21:08:30 <Bosmon> What I suggest you do is have a modelised field in the parent which is a running count of "instantiated but not completed subcomponents"
2018-07-16T21:08:55 <Bosmon> Every time you construct a subcomponent you increase the count by one, and when the global function is called when one is ready, you decrease it
2018-07-16T21:09:08 <Bosmon> When the count hits zero you can assume that everything is initialised
2018-07-16T21:09:27 <Bosmon> Although I\'m not quite clear what your next step is intended to be after having made these things
2018-07-16T21:09:52 <colinclark> Yes, I did once do something like this
2018-07-16T21:09:58 <Bosmon> Again, it\'s a shame that the "new framework" is not reviewed since this would allow you to defer the onCreate of a component to an arbitrary later time
2018-07-16T21:10:01 <colinclark> it felt a bit awkward (because it is) but was quite easy to implement
2018-07-16T21:10:12 <colinclark> I can\'t remember if I produced anything more generically reuseable; I don\'t think I did
2018-07-16T21:11:37 * jhung has quit
2018-07-16T21:12:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: thanks.. i\'m not sure if the issue is exactly the same.. more that the youtube api may or may not be loaded from the script in the head before the the components start to initialize. But once it is there, everything can carry on as normal.
2018-07-16T21:13:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, if you are just deferring on loading on a script, that can indeed be pushed up to the head of the component tree as per I/O as I suggested earlier
2018-07-16T21:13:26 <Justin_o> In trying things out on my own, it\'s usually loaded in time, but not always. And i suppose if the internet is slow, or the connection to YouTube is down it may take a long time
2018-07-16T21:13:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I assume you\'re embedding this within "A UIO" of some kind?
2018-07-16T21:13:59 <Justin_o> it will become an enactor at some point
2018-07-16T21:14:26 <Justin_o> i guess we could add it there, but i\'m not sure it\'s reasonable to wait for it when it may not be used all the time
2018-07-16T21:14:46 <Justin_o> into the top of the prefs editor loader that is
2018-07-16T21:15:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok - you can always contribute it there using a contextAwareness definition
2018-07-16T21:16:14 <Bosmon> That is, make a platform check for the availability of the API, as well as the requirement to use it, and then contribute a grade into the templateLoader that then indeed waits to load it
2018-07-16T21:16:24 <Justin_o> i mean even in the case that it is an adjuster, but it may not be set
2018-07-16T21:16:32 <Justin_o> ah okay
