2018-03-08T16:02:09 <lliskovoi> Hey everyone, especially HTML pros: is a data-locale attribute a valid way of defining language of parts (i.e. when language on the page is different from the main page language), instead of a lang attribute?
2018-03-08T16:04:01 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel
2018-03-08T16:06:40 * sepidehshahi_ is now known as sepidehshahi
2018-03-08T16:07:27 <colinclark> lliskovoi: My understanding is that data- attributes are essentially places to hang custom information within a document
2018-03-08T16:07:40 <colinclark> so that it\'s unlikely that a user agent will act on it, but a framework may do some in some way
2018-03-08T16:07:43 * cindyli has quit
2018-03-08T16:08:03 <colinclark> such as, perhaps, loading the appropriate language bundles on the client side
2018-03-08T16:09:34 <lliskovoi> oh boy, colinclark, is there a way I can figure out whether or not it\'s doing that?
2018-03-08T16:09:44 <colinclark> which means it\'s also not likely to be a substitute for the use of the lang attribute
2018-03-08T16:09:54 <colinclark> I guess it depends on what framework they\'re using, lliskovoi
2018-03-08T16:10:05 <colinclark> the question is if it even matters :)
2018-03-08T16:10:24 <colinclark> as far as I know, and I could be wrong, a data- attribute will mean nothing to a browser or to, for example, a screenreader
2018-03-08T16:11:35 <lliskovoi> yeah, just doing a run-through with VoiceOver and it\'s reading the French as English, so at the very least , it doesn\'t reliably identify it as French
2018-03-08T16:11:39 <lliskovoi> thanks for your help!
2018-03-08T16:11:42 <colinclark> yeah, exactly
2018-03-08T16:12:01 <colinclark> so a lang attribute will still be needed to cue voiceover to make the switch, as far as I know
2018-03-08T16:12:33 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-03-08T16:12:35 <colinclark> all the data-locale attribute is doing is cuing the site\'s own software to perform the localization on its side of the fence :)

2018-03-08T17:03:04 <alanharnum> interesting use of a number of technologies - personal data recording, mesh networks for sharing information in areas with poor bandwidth, etc
2018-03-08T17:03:13 <alanharnum> "The eNuk app allows people to take a photograph, record comments, and drop a geo-location pin anywhere. Once they return to an area with data access, that information is automatically uploaded to a central server, and is shared with everyone else who has the app."
2018-03-08T17:03:34 <alanharnum> danayo gmoss in particular - some of the things we\'ve been discussing in SJRK context ^
2018-03-08T17:04:23 <gmoss> alanharnum: cool, sounds very neat. Checking it out now!

2018-03-08T17:15:23 <gmoss> alanharnum: very cool story, and a great idea for an app. <3 CBC :)
2018-03-08T17:15:59 <gmoss> if we knew that we would "only" need to build a mobile app and not a website for our efforts right now, it would make the offline storage and updating functions much easier to deal with
2018-03-08T17:16:07 <gmoss> all the same, this is great stuff

2018-03-08T18:01:10 <newpy> when you say design of "inclusive user interfaces," do you mean colorblind-friendly etc?

2018-03-08T18:04:12 <danayo> michelled, gmoss, alanharnum, jessm_, colinclark and everyone: some social justice related video stories from Medecins San Frontieres - stories about women for IWD. Not first person - mostly told from the perpsective of the MSF workers. Note: some of these address sexual violence and are difficult to hear http://becauseimawoman.msf.org/en/
2018-03-08T18:07:04 <jhung> Hi there newpy - "inclusive user interfaces" to me implies that during the planning, design, and creation of a user interface, a broad range of users are included in the process so that their perspectives are considered.
2018-03-08T18:07:29 <jhung> for example, something like this can be used to help create a design for a user interface: https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/activities/VirtuousTornado.html

2018-03-08T19:09:34 <gmoss> hearing and seeing the first- and second-hand accounts was very powerful to me, more so than text alone would have been
2018-03-08T19:13:23 <alanharnum> gmoss michelled: should we chat about storytelling at 2:20 real quick?
2018-03-08T19:13:47 <michelled> yep, that works for me alanharnum
2018-03-08T19:14:52 <alanharnum> ok let\'s do it at my desk (at least at first) so I can show you both what I\'ve done on server side
