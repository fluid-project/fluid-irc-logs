2018-09-26T15:33:45 <carenwatkins_> Ah, great. jhung Can I access it?
2018-09-26T15:33:59 <jhung> carenwatkins_: you can edit it using the Theme Editor. Go to Sidebar > Appearance > Editor.
2018-09-26T15:34:01 <jhung> then...
2018-09-26T15:34:37 <jhung> carenwatkins_: in the right sidebar that shows different theme files, choose "Theme Footer (footer.php)".
2018-09-26T15:35:02 <jhung> Then in the editor on Line 46, you can see the footer text there.

2018-09-26T19:41:31 <Justin_o> danayo: sorry i got distracted with a work conversation during your question, so you may have covered this. I wonder if we need to have a style guide for our work to capture some things. Like focus styling and etc. I wonder if that would simplify the creation of mockups and wireframes.

2018-09-26T20:13:20 <danayo> hey Justin_o: I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve considered a style guide before\xe2\x80\xa6I think keeping it more general could work - like \xe2\x80\x9censure the visible focus state is clearly visible and in high contrast\xe2\x80\x9d etc
2018-09-26T20:15:24 <danayo> it could be combined with something like \xe2\x80\x9cdocumenting a11y considerations in wireframes\xe2\x80\x9d as an ILDH entry perhaps - something like what you were suggesting michelled
2018-09-26T20:16:25 <Justin_o> danayo: that seems reasonable
