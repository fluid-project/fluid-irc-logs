2018-03-05T18:14:32 <gtirloni> do the current co-op students know about the japanese cheesecake *tradition*? :-)
2018-03-05T18:15:18 <grrrero> gtirloni: Hahahahaha
2018-03-05T18:21:05 <JessM> grrrero: thanks!

2018-03-05T18:24:52 <jessm_> Justin_o: this says "free trial" on irc cloud -- presumably that it not a permanent free -- do you pay for it?
2018-03-05T18:32:25 <grrrero> jessm_: You don\'t have to pay for premium
2018-03-05T18:32:58 <grrrero> I use the free version and you basically just get disconnected after 3 hours and can only connect up to 2 or 3 devices I think!
2018-03-05T18:33:12 <grrrero> But otherwise free version works fine :)
2018-03-05T18:33:19 <grrrero> jessm: ^
2018-03-05T18:34:13 <jessm> grrrero: thanks; is there a better way to get notifications than just notify all messages?

2018-03-05T18:35:15 <grrrero> You can indicate which keywords you want to be notified for
2018-03-05T18:35:29 <jessm> grrrero: much helpful!
