2018-04-25T14:45:10 <danayo> michelled: thanks for merging FLOE-550, I just went to add the tip and realised I\xe2\x80\x99d already done it :p
2018-04-25T14:46:03 <michelled> :)
2018-04-25T14:47:25 <michelled> danayo: gmoss and I made some good progress on the story telling tool for the story sprint. we are going to want the new branding late next week, I think
2018-04-25T14:47:36 <michelled> do you think that\'s possible?
2018-04-25T14:47:52 <danayo> sure michelled
2018-04-25T14:48:17 <danayo> that\xe2\x80\x99s great
2018-04-25T14:49:43 <danayo> michelled: I\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with Juliana to see if they have any designs yet for the festival etc
2018-04-25T14:49:52 <michelled> great! thanks danayo
2018-04-25T14:50:21 <danayo> if not michelled, maybe we can pull from some of those illustrations

2018-04-25T15:54:13 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: this is what I mean when I talk about retrospectives in Agile: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective
2018-04-25T15:55:38 <alanharnum> this Atlassian Team Playbook project is quite interesting, in fact, as a practice-oriented "handbook": https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook
2018-04-25T15:56:25 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Would it make sense to categorize notebook/sketchbook entries, e.g. "essay" or "video" or "idea"
2018-04-25T15:56:44 <michelled1> alanharnum: we used to run them regularly in the fluid community
2018-04-25T15:56:49 <michelled1> I thought they were quite helpful
2018-04-25T15:58:54 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: these are very interesting examples, particularly the team playbook
2018-04-25T15:59:44 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: yeah, it\'s very "big Agile" oriented, but as a set of artifacts to guide practice, it\'s an interesting approach to design, interaction, etc
2018-04-25T16:08:24 <danayo> simonjb, sepidehshahi: could we move the MyL3 meeting to noon? sounds like Jeevan is ok with any time before 1
2018-04-25T16:10:09 <sepidehshahi> that works for me danayo
2018-04-25T16:13:26 <simonjb> danayo, sepidehshahi: noon is good for me
2018-04-25T16:14:00 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: I see it more like the design crit we had about our co-design experiences a few weeks ago. Maybe after we are done with each project (if we are done ;)) we could have an informal session to talk openly about the project. and we can capture the notes in a \xe2\x80\x9cretrospective\xe2\x80\x9d page specific to that project. just a thouhgt :)
2018-04-25T16:14:29 <danayo> that sounds like a good idea to me sepidehshahi!

2018-04-25T16:40:53 <sepidehshahi> thanks simonjb and danayo, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jeevan know that we have moved the meeting to noon.

2018-04-25T17:02:48 <colinclark> neuralmilkhotel: It might, yes\xe2\x80\x94but we can keep it really simple for this first version
2018-04-25T17:02:57 <colinclark> and make it more sophisticated once we have funding :)
2018-04-25T17:03:06 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Gotcha :)
2018-04-25T17:03:35 * YehchanP joined the channel
2018-04-25T17:03:36 <colinclark> The idea of this is to break away from the formality of information architecture like "news and events," and instead reflect posting that are much more frequent and informal and sketchy in nature
2018-04-25T17:03:43 <colinclark> sketchy in the sense of "a sketch or idea" :)
2018-04-25T17:03:52 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Hmmm
2018-04-25T17:04:10 <colinclark> this is part of our "open design studio" idea, where our in-progress work is regularly reflected on the website and in various collaborative forums
