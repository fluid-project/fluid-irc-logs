2018-07-19T16:02:38 <danayo> hi jhung, what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing with the CISL stortyelling sounds really interesting! I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing - it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s something we could probably apply to SJRK and elsewhere

2018-07-19T16:05:30 <jhung> It\'s still super early design thinking danayo, but I think there\'s potential in this direction. Would you have time later today or tomorrow to chat about it?
2018-07-19T16:07:13 <danayo> sure jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some time at 3:15ET today
2018-07-19T16:07:23 <danayo> does that work for you?
2018-07-19T16:07:27 <jhung> That works danayo.
2018-07-19T16:07:31 <danayo> great, thanks
