b'2018-03-19T19:59:09 <michelled> hi danayo - I don\'t really know if it\'s passed or not, but I think we are good to just get them in when we can
2018-03-19T19:59:13 <grrrero> sepidehshahi: michelled suggested changing the description to the Inclusive Learning Experiences to "Learn about building positive and constructive environments for self-learning and self-reflection with learners who have diverse learning needs and preferences."
2018-03-19T19:59:13 <colinclark> I don\'t think I\'d sweat it\xe2\x80\x94last I heard Jutta was headed into her meetings there a few hours ago
2018-03-19T19:59:31 <grrrero> What do you think sepidehshahi ?
2018-03-19T19:59:47 <michelled> grrrero, sepidehshahi: I took it directly from the handbook entry ;)
2018-03-19T19:59:56 <grrrero> michelled: Oh! Ok
2018-03-19T20:00:12 <michelled> sepidehshahi: is that ok?
2018-03-19T20:00:48 <sepidehshahi> yes absolutely grrrero and michelled
2018-03-19T20:01:45 <jhung> danayo and colinclark - I can pitch in here and there as well. I can take the collaborative art activity since I had a hand in the creation of that and would love to read about its current incarnation.
2018-03-19T20:03:40 <colinclark> totally, jhung, let\'s both review them both
2018-03-19T20:05:06 <jhung> Sounds good colinclark
2018-03-19T20:07:04 <danayo> thanks so much jhung, colinclark
2018-03-19T20:07:56 <colinclark> no problem, danayo
2018-03-19T20:08:00 <colinclark> hope you\'re feeling a bit better

2018-03-19T20:16:23 <michelled> of course! thx grrrero
2018-03-19T20:16:24 <grrrero> It\'s in A Nonvisual Interface for a Blocks Language (2016)

2018-03-19T20:30:17 <grrrero> np
2018-03-19T20:41:40 <danayo> colinclark and everyone: have you seen this? A delivery platform for worker-owned coops https://coopcycle.org/en/#about
2018-03-19T20:42:20 <danayo> We want to build a whole political and economical ecosystem around the software, clashing with the one developed by the \xe2\x80\x9cgig economy\xe2\x80\x9d platforms. We are creating a federation of worker-owned cooperatives, which will use, own and manage the CoopCycle software.
2018-03-19T20:45:12 <colinclark> danayo: wow, interesting
2018-03-19T20:45:29 <colinclark> I hadn\'t heard of them
2018-03-19T20:46:35 <danayo> I think they\xe2\x80\x99re based in Belgium or France
2018-03-19T20:46:51 <colinclark> they have a very odd open source license
2018-03-19T20:47:04 <colinclark> I mean, so odd I\'m not sure we could actually work with it
2018-03-19T20:47:07 <danayo> how so colinclark ?
2018-03-19T20:47:50 <colinclark> https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web#license
2018-03-19T20:48:04 <colinclark> Their description of the license is actually misleading, it seems like
2018-03-19T20:48:13 <colinclark> they say "you may only use..."
2018-03-19T20:48:46 <colinclark> whereas it appears that the license is much more specific
2018-03-19T20:49:07 <colinclark> "You may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 [related to use and redistribution] for commercial purposes only if...
