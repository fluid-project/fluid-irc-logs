2018-02-07T15:23:03 <sepidehshahi> Hi fluid-everyone have you ever tried downloading or exporting multiple sections of Media Wiki as PDF or text files?
2018-02-07T15:24:31 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I\'ve never tried, but I would use the Print to PDF feature built into MacOS.
2018-02-07T15:25:16 <sepidehshahi> thanks jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try that
2018-02-07T15:26:11 <jhung> sepidehshahi: no prob. Let me know if you need help with that.
2018-02-07T15:28:31 <sepidehshahi> the only problem is that none of the links within the document, and large version of the images are transferred when I print to PDF.

2018-02-07T16:22:46 <alanharnum> this is an interesting reflection on the evolution of design in the corporate world - essentially, more valued than it was 10-15 years ago, but with the requirement that design align itself with the corporate bottom line: http://joelcalifa.com/blog/subverted-design/
2018-02-07T16:23:14 <alanharnum> connects it to the rise of more and more sophisticated "dark" UX techniques

2018-02-07T16:59:20 <alanharnum> danayo: yup
2018-02-07T17:10:06 <grrrero> alanharnum: Off-tangent, but I love the "Are we the baddies?"
2018-02-07T17:10:26 <grrrero> Also alanharnum might you have any thoughts/questions for Andre Baynes?
2018-02-07T17:11:07 <gmoss> grrrero: Mitchell and Webb?
2018-02-07T17:11:15 <grrrero> gmoss: Yes!!!!
2018-02-07T17:11:28 <gmoss> i love their work :)
2018-02-07T17:11:42 <grrrero> gmoss: Same :D
2018-02-07T17:12:50 <alanharnum> grrrero: I\'m super-interested in the "speculative design" concept and how it connects to science fiction and other forms of storytelling that aren\'t focused on the "real world"
2018-02-07T17:13:30 <grrrero> alanharnum: Noted, I do agree with all of you danayo and gmoss ; this spec-fi angle is an intriguing one
2018-02-07T17:14:20 <alanharnum> I\'m really interested in futurism in general, and how we envision and work to enact futures that aren\'t centered in the replication of existing power structures / power dynamics
2018-02-07T17:15:09 <alanharnum> this is especially on my mind recently because I\'ve been rereading a lot of Le Guin
2018-02-07T17:15:23 <grrrero> Ahh he also curated a TODO exhibition called "Hacking Black Futures"
2018-02-07T17:15:46 <grrrero> Which would be super relevant and on-point on resisting these existing power dynamics like you said
2018-02-07T17:15:56 <grrrero> And yes, RIP Le Guin :(
2018-02-07T17:16:16 <alanharnum> yeah that\'s the one I was looking at on cleversociety

2018-02-07T18:14:45 <danayo> alanharnum I love what Ursula Le Guid said about sci-fi and spec fiction writers being \xe2\x80\x9crealists of a larger reality\xe2\x80\x9d

2018-02-07T19:18:10 <grrrero> alanharnum gmoss danayo Andre did not speak much about his storytelling and design process but he is interested in doing a community meeting at some point \xe2\x80\x94 he is unfortunately fully booked for the next couple of months but he was interested in what we do and the tools we are developing and that he would like to integrate some of them into his own projects. Also if we were to move his community meeting to
2018-02-07T19:18:10 <grrrero> 1:30pm EST would that be a problem for anyone? fluid-everyone
2018-02-07T19:19:13 <gmoss> grrrero: I\'m flexible!
2018-02-07T19:19:17 <danayo> sounds good grrrero
2018-02-07T19:19:32 <grrrero> Cool thanks gmoss danayo!
2018-02-07T19:19:35 <Justin_o> grrrero: it might depend on the specific day, but looking at the calendar, in general it should be fine
