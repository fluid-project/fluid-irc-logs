2018-04-06T15:38:50 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: another late start today, I'm on my way into the office but I'm not going to be able to make standup. Yesterday after the GSOC meeting I spent time working on the Storytelling Tool to get it to pass the laser eye checklist, adding documentation for every function, grade and component. After that I spent a brief time reading proposals, which I'll continue to do today before our meeting later

2018-04-06T17:57:36 <jessm> janardan: YehchanP and Rutvi, when she connects, I came across an article today that had some interesting references in it. i'll share the original article and then the references that I think will be helpful in understanding the user: https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/03/how-babies-learn-and-why-robots-cant-compete
2018-04-06T17:57:48 <janardan> alright thanks jessm
2018-04-06T17:57:57 <jessm> http://templeinfantlab.com -- where children teach adults -- love that
2018-04-06T17:58:03 * rutvi joined the channel
2018-04-06T17:59:02 <jessm> and then https://www.babycenter.ca/c25004305/your-preschooler-month-by-month has a 'development' link for preschoolers and for toddlers too
2018-04-06T17:59:10 <jessm> hi rutvi, lemme paste those links again
2018-04-06T17:59:22 <jessm> http://templeinfantlab.com -- where children teach adults -- love that
2018-04-06T17:59:29 <janardan> yes
2018-04-06T17:59:31 <jessm> janardan: YehchanP and Rutvi, when she connects, I came across an article today that had some interesting references in it. i'll share the original article and then the references that I think will be helpful in understanding the user: https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/03/how-babies-learn-and-why-robots-cant-compete
2018-04-06T17:59:34 <janardan> she got the other link
2018-04-06T17:59:39 <jessm> ok, great
2018-04-06T18:00:09 <rutvi> thank you jessm
2018-04-06T18:01:22 <janardan> jessm: I want to ask again the question I asked thursday, but is this an educational game, a fun game, or whatever game they want?
2018-04-06T18:01:36 <jessm> janardan: YehchanP rutvi any questions you have that your'e struggling with? Any new observations??
2018-04-06T18:02:23 <YehchanP> I am just confused if it is supposed to be an educational game and how educational should it
2018-04-06T18:02:33 <YehchanP> how educational should it be
2018-04-06T18:02:49 <rutvi> no questions right now but I did find good articles for physical impairments, and how to fix design to accommodate for that
2018-04-06T18:03:12 <jessm> YehchanP: good questions! i have been thinking about just what we call 'education' lately. i think it's really supposed to be about play -- and in playing, kids learn
2018-04-06T18:03:20 <jessm> rutvi: do you have the link to the article?
2018-04-06T18:03:51 <rutvi> ya its actually a book but its a sample on google that i've been looking through
2018-04-06T18:04:01 <rutvi> https://books.google.ca/books?id=0qh-gcIwebIC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=how+slow+are+switch+games+for+the+impaired+-nintendo&source=bl&ots=Q7AEL9LSxH&sig=HBrftnz6tHA0yHlA5DVeZj7Run0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ1rmsz6PaAhVFbK0KHZ6TBTYQ6AEIXjAF#v=onepage&q&f=false
2018-04-06T18:04:01 <jessm> YehchanP: so, i'd say don't get too wrapped up in the educational aspects of the game. Digital literacy comes through play and use and so does discovery and exploration
2018-04-06T18:04:25 <YehchanP> So focus on exploration and discovery then?
2018-04-06T18:04:43 <janardan> jessm: Yeah, we came to a consensus that we would be doing the switch user interface
2018-04-06T18:05:00 <jessm> janardan: nice! right on time for a Friday decision :)
2018-04-06T18:05:15 <janardan> jessm: making sure we are organized :D
2018-04-06T18:05:22 <jessm> exploration and discovery for the switch user -- remember those kids are a bit older
2018-04-06T18:05:42 <jessm> rutvi: nice find! this book looks interesting
2018-04-06T18:05:43 <janardan> YehchanP: i think if we do exporlation and discovery, we can kind of incoroporate some educational background into it
2018-04-06T18:06:23 <jessm> janardan YehchanP rutvi : i found an article about the design of grocery stores the other day and it made me think of you all :)
2018-04-06T18:06:45 * michelled joined the channel
2018-04-06T18:06:52 <janardan> jessm: Oh you reminded me of a question
2018-04-06T18:06:53 <jessm> i'd actually recommend you think about fun, less about educational stuffz
2018-04-06T18:07:21 <janardan> can we make a twist into our discovery game
2018-04-06T18:07:35 <janardan> like in space or like an alien kitchen?
2018-04-06T18:07:45 <rutvi> and if we are making it slightly educational when should we know the students curriculum
2018-04-06T18:08:38 <rutvi> and will we be able to talk to the students before hand so we can base the game on their needws
2018-04-06T18:08:41 <rutvi> needs *
2018-04-06T18:11:19 <jessm> yes, you'll be talking to students; to learn what they're learning do some research into child development online
2018-04-06T18:11:32 <jessm> janardan: why wouldn't you include a twist? :P
2018-04-06T18:13:03 <jessm> rutvi: i wouldn't over-think the educational piece -- YehchanP janardan and you should do some small bits of research so you understand what kids of a certain age are likely learning (e.g. basic math, not algebra) but you don't need to know their exact curriculum
2018-04-06T18:13:27 <jessm> and rutvi before you meet kids and parents i'd like you all to do some watching and learning from videos of people using switch interfaces online
2018-04-06T18:13:29 <YehchanP> will do
2018-04-06T18:14:01 <jessm> did you all get a chance to track down some videos yet? The Tecla shield gamer from Australia and on YouTube generally?
2018-04-06T18:14:20 <janardan> I was beat down from thursday with the 15km walk with yehchan
2018-04-06T18:14:25 <janardan> so not yet
2018-04-06T18:14:38 <janardan> I will look into it now
2018-04-06T18:15:57 <janardan> Right now we are working on what we think discovery games mean, and at 2:30 we will meet up and talk about our ideas and map them up together
2018-04-06T18:17:00 <jessm> janardan: why did YehchanP make you walk 15k?!
2018-04-06T18:17:12 <jessm> i like your planning folks :)
2018-04-06T18:17:23 <janardan> we were on a trip yesterday so only rutvi was here
2018-04-06T18:17:37 <janardan> it was a trip outdoors and yehchan walked a bit more since he got lost
2018-04-06T18:18:19 <jessm> ah! well, YehchanP getting lost is my favourite thing to do -- we'll have to talk about your experience more on Tuesday -- I get you 3 all day :D
2018-04-06T18:18:42 <YehchanP> What time should we be here on Tuesday?
2018-04-06T18:19:20 <jessm> YehchanP: i'll be there by 9 and if you are too we can take a SHORT walk to get some coffee
2018-04-06T18:19:47 <janardan> Um by any chance can i work remote on that day
2018-04-06T18:20:03 <janardan> Because I do have a chance to talk with 6 year olds to 10 year olds
2018-04-06T18:20:11 <janardan> and I can help research on it
2018-04-06T18:22:39 <jessm> janardan: i'd prefer we're all together in the office. we'll touch base with the kids at Bloorview and Beit Issie soon enough
2018-04-06T18:23:06 <janardan> alright, i will come then at 8 - 9
2018-04-06T18:53:22 <jessm> alanharnum: gmoss where we meeting?
2018-04-06T18:53:33 <alanharnum> jessm: I'll open my Vidyo room
2018-04-06T18:53:38 <gmoss> jessm alanharnum: sounds good!
