2018-04-23T15:33:22 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Still on the way to the IDRC; Friday worked with Sepideh on the Inclusive Cities wireframe, incorporated an asset provided by Lisa for SNOW and worked on SNOW-18 and 19, continued the work over the weekend and doing the same for today. Aiming to get most of it done by tomorrow. Also got measurements from Caren so will be incorporating those in as well.

2018-04-23T15:49:11 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: I can see it my sent emails but I have not received them either. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the issue is. let\xe2\x80\x99s give it a few more minutes and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try resending them
2018-04-23T15:49:38 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: okay.. i guess we can ping gtirloni too to see if there is something up with the mailing lists

2018-04-23T16:05:20 <gtirloni> sepidehshahi: hi! I just checked the logs and we haven't received it from OCAD yet. Did you send it through the webmail or are you using a local mail client (Outlook, etc)?
2018-04-23T16:06:22 <sepidehshahi> gtirloni: I used my local mail client
2018-04-23T16:08:50 <gtirloni> maybe it's in the outgoing box or someting like that. I just sent a test email and it seems to be working
2018-04-23T16:09:56 <sepidehshahi> ok, thanks for checking gtirloni
2018-04-23T16:10:53 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: could you please send the crit email to the list as I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I send it again it will go through? thanks,
