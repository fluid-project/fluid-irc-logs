2018-05-24T20:07:48 <sepidehshahi> I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know how exactly it works but it\xe2\x80\x99s a cool idea
2018-05-24T20:07:54 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: thanks!
2018-05-24T20:33:24 <simonjb> sepidehshahi and others: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/amazon-confirms-that-echo-device-secretly-shared-users-private-audio/
2018-05-24T20:33:58 <simonjb> for anyone wondering about security/privacy and having devices in your home that always listen
2018-05-24T20:35:38 <sepidehshahi> this is aweful\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-24T20:37:26 <simonjb> Danielle next asked exactly why the device sent recorded audio to a contact: "He said the device guessed what we were saying."
2018-05-24T20:38:13 <simonjb> I\'m not sure what this means exactly but does it mean it thought they said that they wanted to share the audio?
2018-05-24T20:38:35 <simonjb> Seems like a risky feature to include if that\'s the case
2018-05-24T20:38:50 <simonjb> Given the non-perfect nature of voice recognition
2018-05-24T20:41:11 <simonjb> at least without some sort of confirmation from the user

2018-05-24T20:42:08 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem you have with voice and gesture recognition. I remember when working in a lab full of smart TV\xe2\x80\x99s we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a normal conversation, TVs started turning on and off and doing random functions based on what they had picked up from our conversation.
2018-05-24T20:43:22 <sepidehshahi> definitely a confirmation would help
