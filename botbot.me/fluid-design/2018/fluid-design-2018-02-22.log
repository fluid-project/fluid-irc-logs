2018-02-22T19:23:15 <danayo> michelled1, sepidehshahi: as I mentioned at standup - when I thought more about our discussion yesterday I realised I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable asking participants to bring content in physical/printed format only (and then labelling it with tactile labels etc) - I think we need to let them bring it in whatever form works for them (including audio files etc), and also be prepared (as much as we can ahead of time) to work in whatever way works best for th
2018-02-22T19:23:17 <danayo> so we could have labels available, but also maybe have large monitors set up in case they want to work digitally, or other things we can think of.
2018-02-22T19:24:13 <danayo> what do you think?
2018-02-22T19:24:18 <danayo> it makes it a bit harder in some ways because we can\xe2\x80\x99t be totally prepared and have to be flexible
2018-02-22T19:24:32 <danayo> but I think we can spend some time at the beginning working it out
2018-02-22T19:24:39 <danayo> as part of the co-design process
2018-02-22T19:24:50 <danayo> co-designing the co-design session :)
2018-02-22T19:27:59 <sepidehshahi> I totally agree with you danayo. but I need to think more about how it will work and how we can incorporate both the analogue and digital content together, specially when we are mapping the system. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it more thoughts today :)
2018-02-22T19:28:41 <danayo> great sepidehshahi. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we need to incorporate them - perhaps the small groups can come to consensus about how they will each work
2018-02-22T19:28:44 <danayo> thanks
2018-02-22T19:29:17 <danayo> and if they want to switch up the groups a bit a the beginning in order to do so, that\xe2\x80\x99s ok too
2018-02-22T19:29:18 <sepidehshahi> makes sense danayo
2018-02-22T19:31:08 <danayo> sepidehshahi, michelled1: I\xe2\x80\x99m also thinking that some of the content may just provide inspiration - it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to be \xe2\x80\x9cmapped\xe2\x80\x9d exactly, if that makes sense
2018-02-22T19:31:44 <sepidehshahi> absolutely danayo
2018-02-22T19:37:39 <grrrero> Hi sepidehshahi and danayo do you think this link/pdf is good to add to the FLOE resources page? https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/the-principles-of-inclusive-design.pdf
2018-02-22T19:40:50 <danayo> grrrero: I think it is. I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at it before. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s good to include some resources focused on physical inclusion/access/space
2018-02-22T19:44:19 <grrrero> Thanks danayo :)
2018-02-22T19:46:59 <michelled1> danayo: that sounds really good
