2018-02-05T14:40:25 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: last week i published the 3rd beta for UIO+. It includes the icon you made for it. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%2B/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek?authuser=1
2018-02-05T14:41:00 <Justin_o> Regarding the icon, are the source files uploaded to ownCloud? I wasn\'t able to find them when i looked through the other day.
2018-02-05T14:41:47 <Justin_o> the other thing is that the requirements for the icon used in the chrome web store are slightly different from those used in the extension. It still looks good to me, but we might want to add another version that follows the chrome web store guidelines
2018-02-05T14:44:05 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: the source file is uploaded to ownCloud: IDRC-Design > Visual Resources > Icons > Infusion_Icons_Library_V1_SS
2018-02-05T14:44:17 <sepidehshahi> please let me know if you have difficulty finding it
2018-02-05T14:45:19 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: i mean the UIO+ icon itself, the gear heart one
2018-02-05T14:45:35 <sepidehshahi> oh sorry Justin_o you are talking about the UIO+ icon! it should also be uploaded on the owncloud let me send you a link
2018-02-05T14:46:38 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks
2018-02-05T14:47:15 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-02-05T14:48:10 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: IDRC-Design > Projects > UIO > UIO Icon > UIOPlus_Icon_V4_SS . I have saved it as PDF. I can save it as AI in the same folder.
2018-02-05T14:48:54 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks
2018-02-05T14:49:28 <Justin_o> also here are the requirements for a icon that is shown in the Chrome Web Store, would you be able to make an additional version of the gear heart one following these requirements.
2018-02-05T14:49:49 <sepidehshahi> sure
2018-02-05T14:50:10 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/RM8nrl6O/
2018-02-05T14:50:20 <Justin_o> thanks, hope it isn\'t too much trouble
2018-02-05T14:50:29 <Justin_o> and sorry i didn\'t notice this requirement earlier
2018-02-05T14:55:10 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: since our icon is circular I should just add one additional size for 112x112, right?
2018-02-05T15:09:32 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-02-05T15:10:57 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: um.. seems like it still needs to be 128x128. the visual part itself should be 112x112 but the remainder should be transparent..
2018-02-05T15:11:00 <Justin_o> "For circular icons, the visual icon should be 112x112 (use alpha to make the remaining pixels transparent)"
2018-02-05T15:11:23 <lliskovoi> everyone: I\'m having some trouble figuring out the cause of some real strange behaviour of a dynamic table on the OCADU website, any volunteers want to have a look and help me sort this out?
2018-02-05T15:11:25 * avtar joined the channel
2018-02-05T15:12:18 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: i have a few minutes i could spare
2018-02-05T15:12:29 <sepidehshahi> ok Justin_o
2018-02-05T15:12:44 <lliskovoi> awesome! This is the page: https://www.ocadu.ca/students/dates-and-deadlines.htm
2018-02-05T15:12:49 <lliskovoi> it\'s a filtered table
2018-02-05T15:13:10 <lliskovoi> when I\'m using VoiceOver, i can\'t drill into the table, it\'s like the screen reader can\'t reach the table details
2018-02-05T15:13:25 <lliskovoi> with NVDA it reads a mix of hidden and visible items
2018-02-05T15:13:33 <lliskovoi> that\'s as far as I got, no idea what\'s happening
2018-02-05T15:13:54 <lliskovoi> display is set to none for filtered out items, but that shouldn\'t impact the behaviour of visible ones I don\'t think
2018-02-05T15:15:18 <Justin_o> hmm.. i don\'t think it should.. i\'ll take a look at it now.. do i need to set any of the filters specifically?
2018-02-05T15:15:45 <lliskovoi> nope
2018-02-05T15:16:04 <Justin_o> okay
2018-02-05T15:22:04 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: in VoiceOver i navigated by table, it reached the table but said 1 column 0 rows
2018-02-05T15:22:22 <lliskovoi> can you then get to the content?
2018-02-05T15:22:48 <lliskovoi> oh I see, I guess maybe it\'s stumbling because it has 0 rows
2018-02-05T15:22:51 <Justin_o> nope
2018-02-05T15:23:09 <lliskovoi> how is that even possible? There are rows in the markup
2018-02-05T15:23:13 <Justin_o> yes.. it could be that it somehow has registered that the content has been modified so it thinks there isn\'t anything there
2018-02-05T15:28:30 <Justin_o> did you validate the markup?
2018-02-05T15:28:34 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: ^
2018-02-05T15:28:36 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-02-05T15:28:57 <lliskovoi> no, haven\'t tried that yet
2018-02-05T15:29:04 <lliskovoi> give me a few minutes
2018-02-05T15:31:42 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: can you try the new icon? https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/lVtc8qOnTZpx4Ko
2018-02-05T15:32:14 <sepidehshahi> all assets are saved in the UIO Icon Assets folder
2018-02-05T15:33:33 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks, i\'ll give that a shot
2018-02-05T15:33:40 <sepidehshahi> thanks
2018-02-05T15:33:53 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: i was wondering if the multiple tbody elements might be causing a problem.. it seems like it should be valid though
2018-02-05T15:34:14 <lliskovoi> Justin_o: hmmm, I\'m not seeing anything in the validation check that\'s related to tables
2018-02-05T15:34:24 <lliskovoi> mostly errors related to IDs
2018-02-05T15:34:47 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: yes.. i ran a quick test too and similar thing.. issues with the ul and ids but didn\'t see anything related to the tables
2018-02-05T15:35:12 <Justin_o> maybe i\'ll try to make a quick test page to experiment with to see if it could be an issue for voiceover with the multiple tbodys though
2018-02-05T15:36:13 <lliskovoi> that would be awesome Justin_o! Let me know if you find anything, or if you\'d like to work through it together over Vidyo
2018-02-05T15:37:36 * michelled has quit
2018-02-05T15:40:13 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: quick example https://jsfiddle.net/z8j05wkh/1/show/
2018-02-05T15:40:24 <Justin_o> but looks like the multiple tbodys are not the issue
2018-02-05T15:41:04 <lliskovoi> yep, works fine!
2018-02-05T15:43:40 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: here\'s a problem in terms of validation.. the generated table also has multiple thead elements, and this is invalid https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#the-thead-element
2018-02-05T15:44:02 <Justin_o> it seems to be failing the validation at this spot if i copy the generated table out and just run that through the validator
2018-02-05T15:44:13 <lliskovoi> oh interesting!
2018-02-05T15:44:46 <lliskovoi> ok, so essentially the table is generated in an invalid way that prevents it from being communicated accurately to AT?
2018-02-05T15:44:59 <lliskovoi> Just trying to think through how to communicate it to their team
2018-02-05T15:46:33 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: well i just added a similar case to the test page and it still works, https://jsfiddle.net/z8j05wkh/2/show/
2018-02-05T15:46:43 <Justin_o> so there may be some combination with that and it being dynamic, not sure yet
2018-02-05T15:49:17 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: and this is with the table from the cite put in statically to the example. https://jsfiddle.net/z8j05wkh/3/show/
2018-02-05T15:49:29 <Justin_o> and it also works.. so yah probably something to do with the way it\'s being dynamically added
2018-02-05T15:50:06 <lliskovoi> ok, I might just have to leave it at that and tell them it\'s not working properly, unless you think there\'s a way to figure out what exactly is causing it
2018-02-05T15:52:18 * danayo joined the channel
2018-02-05T15:54:17 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: yah i\'m not sure what exactly is causing it.. unfortunately
2018-02-05T15:54:31 <lliskovoi> no worries, thanks for your help Justin_o!!
2018-02-05T15:55:52 <Justin_o> np, sorry we could track it all the way down, but it\'ll probably be easier for their dev to experiment from the source

2018-02-05T16:39:24 <danayo> grrrero: what was the name of the collaborative storytelling site?
2018-02-05T16:40:03 <grrrero> danayo: It\'s his website http://cleversociety.com/ it\'s just a landing page more of, but no examples of storytelling -- he talks about it
2018-02-05T16:40:24 <grrrero> He\'s a designer/maker
2018-02-05T16:42:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-02-05T16:43:06 <danayo> thanks grrrero
2018-02-05T16:45:05 <grrrero> np danayo
2018-02-05T16:45:38 <danayo> I like this grrrero, from the site: Speculative design uses storytelling to explore ideas outside of physical constraints. It can be a powerful tool for exploring design solutions and reframing socio-economic issues through narrative and story. This kind of storytelling is evident in almost all forms of science fiction and has historically driven how we view the future and the role of technology in our lives. However, media and film has also constrained
2018-02-05T16:45:38 <danayo> expectations of the future and who is valued there.
2018-02-05T16:46:41 <grrrero> danayo: Yeah I hope to pick his brain a bit more on Wednesday before I invite him if he would like to speak at a community workshop -- are there any questions or points you want to take up with him specifically?
2018-02-05T16:51:04 <danayo> grrrero: it would be great to have him do a community meeting. can I join your meeting on Wednesday?
2018-02-05T16:51:32 <grrrero> danayo: I\'m unfortunately just going to meet him for coffee at a cafe, not online :(
2018-02-05T16:51:40 <danayo> ah, no worries grrrero
2018-02-05T16:51:47 <danayo> sounds good
2018-02-05T16:51:49 <grrrero> I can relay your questions to him
2018-02-05T16:52:02 <grrrero> So that he can speak to some things you\'re interested in for a community meeting
2018-02-05T16:52:53 <danayo> sure grrrero - off the top of my head, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to know more about the storytelling process - how they gather stories, if/how they record them, how they move from storytelling to design
2018-02-05T16:53:06 <danayo> if I think of other questions I\xe2\x80\x99ll email you
2018-02-05T16:53:08 <grrrero> Good stuff danayo, will pass it along
2018-02-05T16:53:12 <grrrero> Yes that would be great :)
2018-02-05T16:53:14 <grrrero> Thanks danayo
2018-02-05T16:53:17 <danayo> alanharnum and gmoss might have some thoughts too ^
2018-02-05T16:53:33 <grrrero> Will ping them and ask gmoss when he is back tomorrow
2018-02-05T16:53:44 <danayo> and colinclark ^

2018-02-05T17:54:35 <jhung> grrrero: I anticipate at some point you will be asked to put Google Analytics on Snow? If so, I have a plugin that I\'ve been using and can help add Snow site to our analytics.
2018-02-05T17:54:55 <grrrero> jhung: ooooh good call I totally forgot about Google Analytics
2018-02-05T17:55:09 <grrrero> Also let me know when you\'ve got the documentation for the social media feeds ready :) jhung
2018-02-05T17:55:59 <grrrero> And we talked about this before but it came up in my PR review w/ cindyli; for stylus files, should we add in the README that it needs to be compiled before using the theme, or use grunt and add a task?
2018-02-05T17:56:05 <jhung> grrrero: righto. I\'ll be working on that today for Our Doors are Open. I\'ll document as I go along. I\'ll put it up here when I\'m done: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/wp-a11y-theme+Child+Template+Documentation
2018-02-05T17:56:17 <grrrero> jhung: Awesomesauce :D
2018-02-05T17:58:08 <jhung> grrrero: I\'ve just been giving instructions in the README, but it can be handled with grunt too. I don\'t think grunt is necessary unless we see it doing more than just compile the Stylus files (maybe do some linting of PHP? Is that even a thing?).
2018-02-05T18:00:02 <grrrero> jhung: Yeah it only basically compiles stylus files so probably not best way to go -- but linting PHP I can look into!
2018-02-05T18:01:19 <jhung> grrrero: definitely something to consider. Perhaps put it in the iteration plan page and prioritize it with the other stuff that needs to be done.
2018-02-05T18:02:35 <grrrero> jhung: Will do
2018-02-05T18:03:26 <grrrero> jhung: Should I create a separate JIRA for that?
2018-02-05T18:03:40 <grrrero> And attach it to SNOW or another project
