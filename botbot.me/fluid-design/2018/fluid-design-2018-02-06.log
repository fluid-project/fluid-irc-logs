2018-02-06T15:52:18 <gmoss> grrrero: I just checked out http://cleversociety.com/ and I\'m really intrigued by his work, it\'s very cool stuff. The writing about speculative design appealed to me especially (I\'m a big spec-fic fan). Like danayo, I\'m also curious about how storytelling informs his designs and how the collaborative storytelling process works. We\'ve discussed collaborative storytelling here and there in our SJRK meetings, so this
2018-02-06T15:52:18 <gmoss> is quite relevant.
2018-02-06T15:52:43 <grrrero> gmoss: Awesome, thanks for catching up on that convo
2018-02-06T15:54:48 <grrrero> Oh on that note danayo do you have the link to the wireframes for the SJRK storytelling tool?
2018-02-06T15:56:23 <danayo> yeah sorry grrrero just a sec

2018-02-06T17:43:34 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, do you feel comfortable with the state the Learning diffrence document is currently is? I reviewed it one last time after you made changes. If you think it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, I can go ahead and add it to the handbook
2018-02-06T17:47:35 <jhung> Oh I see what happened grrrero\xe2\x80\xa6 it seems that files from the parent wp-a11y theme have been mixed into your child theme. The parent theme and its files should have remained untouched, and the child theme should just override / extend as needed. For example, there\'s a category.php file in the Snow theme, which is identical to the parent theme. It shouldn\'t be in the child since it just inherits it from the parent.
2018-02-06T17:48:02 <grrrero> Oh I see jhung ok I\'ll remove it if it\'s unnecessary
2018-02-06T17:50:02 <jhung> yeah. grrrero - be careful not to mix the parent into the child by copying or by using a git merge. It would defeat the purpose of inheritance and code efficiency by repeating stuff the parent already declared.
2018-02-06T17:50:16 <grrrero> Got it jhung
2018-02-06T17:51:46 <grrrero> On the same note, the stylus file for SNOW in my SNOW-4 PR is overwriting wp-a11y stuff as well, so I will need to clean that up too
2018-02-06T17:53:59 <grrrero> Got another question jhung -- for the parent files that call `get_sidebar();` -- do I just put in my change and leave the rest blank? e.g. the file will only have some comments and `get_sidebar(\'post\');`

2018-02-06T20:37:59 <jhung> grrrero, Justin_o - I\'m continuing with reviewing the Floe site / UIO+ news article. I\'m checking the news articles to make sure that the headers and footers haven\'t changed.
