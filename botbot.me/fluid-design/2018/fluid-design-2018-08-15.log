2018-08-15T13:53:54 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I\'m feeling less than great this morning so I\'ve stayed home, is there anyone present at the IDRC who would be willing to demonstrate one of the games during the community meeting today?
2018-08-15T13:54:18 <gmoss> it requires audio, and so we need to take advantage of the speakers in the collab room
2018-08-15T13:54:41 <Justin_o> gmoss: I\'ll check with alan, if not I should be able to do it
2018-08-15T13:54:49 <gmoss> Justin_o: great, thank you!

2018-08-15T14:52:56 <alanharnum> Justin_o: we should probably timekeep a bit on this one to make sure there\'s enough time for the final one
2018-08-15T14:59:34 <Justin_o> ah okay.. i hadn\'t realized how late it was getting
2018-08-15T15:04:05 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah I didn\'t think it would be an issue with only four, but want to make sure the final presentation has the same 15-20 minutes the others have taken
2018-08-15T15:04:45 <alanharnum> maybe we can defer questions to the end if necessary, or run a bit long if we\'re all OK with a somewhat laterstart to standup

2018-08-15T15:54:05 <carenwatkins_> Hi Justin_o: alanharnum I unfortunately didn\'t get to hear the full presentation around "games for kids" this morning. What I did hear sounded very cool. I\'m wondering if there might be resources or other info suitable for SNOW. Ria mentioned open and free eyegaze software, for example. SNOW also has a spot for articles, reflections, research pieces if that makes sense.
