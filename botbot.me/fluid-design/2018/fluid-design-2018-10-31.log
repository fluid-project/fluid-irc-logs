2018-10-31T14:25:08 <carenwatkins_> Would anyone be able to easily find out if Piskel is keyboard accessible? I tried on my Mac laptop to use the keyboard to apply pixels to the work area without success. Some alpha keys moved the tool selection around but otherwise nothing. I ask because it may be a good alternative to graph paper and filling in squares for expressing/exploring some math--free, fairly simple interface, can adjust pixel
2018-10-31T14:25:09 <carenwatkins_> size and colour, kids seem to like it. https://www.piskelapp.com/
2018-10-31T14:27:35 <carenwatkins_> easy animation is fun, too :-)

2018-10-31T15:34:50 <carenwatkins_> Vidyo won't let me log in...keeps asking me to down fonts like Xingkai SC (5 different ones so far). Oct. 31?
2018-10-31T15:42:49 <carenwatkins_> Nothing significant to report. Good crit yesterday. I appreciate the work being done around co-design and look forward to considering it in the curriculum development realm. Today I'll be at community in the afternoon (if I can get Vidyo back and running properly). Am focusing on writing an article for MagsCan. I'll be chatting with Lisa for her insights around accessible websites, AODA and such today
2018-10-31T15:42:49 <carenwatkins_> tomorrow. And I'm wearing large spider on my head...perhaps Vidyo is frightened.
2018-10-31T15:43:05 <danayo> carenwatkins_: we need to see the spider!!!
2018-10-31T15:43:24 <carenwatkins_> I know! I want to show it off...
2018-10-31T15:43:50 <carenwatkins_> She's very open to being on screen but Vidyo won't cooperate.
