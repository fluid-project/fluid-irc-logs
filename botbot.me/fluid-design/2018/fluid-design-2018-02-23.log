2018-02-23T16:00:22 <alanharnum> danayo: I'm starting to create initial CSS for the learning reflections site, could you tell me what the font used is? is it freely available via Google Fonts or otherwise?
2018-02-23T16:06:29 <danayo> alanharnum: the header is open sans which is available in google fonts. But I used Myriad Pro for the body - looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s not available in Google fonts, but is available in Adobe Typekit.
2018-02-23T16:07:04 <danayo> We could use open sans for all of it if that makes more sense - I guess we want to stick to the free ones, right?
2018-02-23T16:08:21 <alanharnum> danayo: yup, though feel free to find another font via Google Fonts if you prefer
2018-02-23T16:09:47 <danayo> ok alanharnum,
2018-02-23T16:09:55 <danayo> let me take a quick look
2018-02-23T16:15:23 <danayo> carenwatkins: do you have an opinion about the readability of Roboto vs Open Sans? or about Roboto in general?
2018-02-23T16:15:45 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of using Roboto for our learning refelctions site and storytelling tool body
2018-02-23T16:17:15 <danayo> though staring at it some more I think I still prefer open sans
2018-02-23T16:22:35 <carenwatkins> hi danayo
2018-02-23T16:23:13 <danayo> hi carenwatkins
2018-02-23T16:23:42 <carenwatkins> my personal opinion is that Roboto in some applications can lack personality.
2018-02-23T16:24:13 <carenwatkins> Even thought google describes it as  modern and approachable
2018-02-23T16:24:51 <carenwatkins> I prefer open sans.
2018-02-23T16:25:09 <danayo> cool! thanks
2018-02-23T16:25:11 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99m also experimenting with Noto
2018-02-23T16:25:21 <danayo> oh, interesting
2018-02-23T16:26:13 <carenwatkins> which is the a very extensive family https://www.google.com/get/noto/
2018-02-23T16:27:21 <carenwatkins> \xe2\x80\x9caims to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel\xe2\x80\x9d
2018-02-23T16:31:51 <carenwatkins> Everyone: I\xe2\x80\x99m unable to join the collab room on vidyo for some reason. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to restart.
2018-02-23T16:43:13 <danayo> carenwatkins: what is the name of the artist who created your painting?
2018-02-23T16:46:43 <carenwatkins> danayo: Pearl van Geest http://www.pearlvangeest.com/home
2018-02-23T16:47:08 <grrrero> michelled: Call you directly?
2018-02-23T16:47:25 <danayo> thanks carenwatkins - super interesting work!
2018-02-23T16:48:53 <carenwatkins> ya, glad you and michelled asked because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at her more recent work. :-)
2018-02-23T16:51:23 <michelled> grrrero: yep, call when you're ready
2018-02-23T16:52:50 <carenwatkins> danayo I found out about Pearl\xe2\x80\x99s work about 15 years ago through Katherine Mulherin gallery on Queen street\xe2\x80\xa6near CAMH. She represents some interesting artists: http://katharinemulherin.com/
2018-02-23T17:06:12 <danayo> cool thanks carenwatkins

2018-02-23T21:32:23 <danayo_> great, let me know if I missed any - and I realise I included others that we'll not use just yet
2018-02-23T21:37:39 <alanharnum> danayo_: it's good to have them all

2018-02-23T22:05:35 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-02-23T22:30:32 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think we should add content to each of the blocks or just a title is sufficient? For example, is it enough to say \xe2\x80\x98Artist Bio\xe2\x80\x99 or is it better to build an actual artist bio mockup. So far I have got the titles (the link is added at the end of google doc)
2018-02-23T22:32:12 <sepidehshahi> and do you think we should have a limit on the number of placeholder blocks danayo?
2018-02-23T22:33:43 <danayo> maybe for now sepidehshahi let\xe2\x80\x99s just label them and put in some lorem ipsum?
2018-02-23T22:33:57 <danayo> it would be fun to find some content, but perhaps for time let\xe2\x80\x99s start there
2018-02-23T22:34:13 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo
2018-02-23T22:34:24 <danayo> what do you mean a limit sepidehshahi ? a limit on the types of content?
2018-02-23T22:35:35 <sepidehshahi> the number of placeholders. I have got almost 20-30 of them. I can definitely simplify and merge some of the if that\xe2\x80\x99s too many
2018-02-23T22:39:18 <danayo> no I think this is good sepidehshahi
2018-02-23T22:39:38 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking perhaps we can make placeholders at a couple of levels of granularity?
2018-02-23T22:39:48 <danayo> some might want to start mapping at a higher level perhaps
2018-02-23T22:40:37 <sepidehshahi> for sure, that would be more similar to the categoriez we have
2018-02-23T22:40:53 <danayo> although
2018-02-23T22:40:55 <danayo> hmmm
2018-02-23T22:41:10 <danayo> I guess if we provide categories, we\xe2\x80\x99re prescribing the organisation/structure
2018-02-23T22:41:18 <danayo> so maybe we let them do that
2018-02-23T22:41:22 <danayo> if they want
2018-02-23T22:41:32 <danayo> i.e create category placeholders
2018-02-23T22:41:44 <danayo> or some other kind of sub-level placeholders
2018-02-23T22:42:08 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^ what do you think?
2018-02-23T22:42:42 <sepidehshahi> sure, so what other kinds of high leve elements we could have?
2018-02-23T22:43:58 <sepidehshahi> e.g connecting to other artists? accessing funds?
2018-02-23T22:44:15 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking we don\xe2\x80\x99t at all sepidehshahi - that we just provide the granular stuff and then co-design the structure/categories in the session
2018-02-23T22:45:01 <sepidehshahi> ok, sounds good and they can always add more with the blanks
2018-02-23T22:45:11 <danayo> exactly
2018-02-23T22:46:21 * lliskovoi has quit

2018-02-23T23:12:05 <danayo_> sepidehshahi: by the way I followed the instructions in Github (to install npm and Grunt etc) and got the Discovery Cats game working
2018-02-23T23:12:17 <danayo_> I think maybe I had old versions
2018-02-23T23:12:21 <sepidehshahi> awesome!
2018-02-23T23:12:33 <danayo_> looking at it again I love it even more :D
2018-02-23T23:13:37 <sepidehshahi> I had totally forgotten about that. danayo_ could you please send the Github page link to grrrero? I think she has a link to an older version of discovery cats
2018-02-23T23:13:54 <sepidehshahi> it was such a fun project!
2018-02-23T23:14:00 <danayo_> it really was
2018-02-23T23:14:20 <danayo_> sure I'll email her with the link
2018-02-23T23:15:13 <sepidehshahi> danayo_: on Monday, what do you think I can work on more for BiT? should I start mocking up some of placeholders or is there anything else that could be useful?
2018-02-23T23:16:11 <danayo_> mockups would be great sepidehshahi. maybe also thinking about stuff we'll need on the day and how we might set up the room?
2018-02-23T23:16:19 <danayo_> monitors etc
2018-02-23T23:16:29 <sepidehshahi> for sure!
2018-02-23T23:16:31 <danayo_> maybe ask Bert what we might be able to use?
2018-02-23T23:16:55 <danayo_> thanks sepidehshahi
2018-02-23T23:17:14 <sepidehshahi> this is great! thank you
