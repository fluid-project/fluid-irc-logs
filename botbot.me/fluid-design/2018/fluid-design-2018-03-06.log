2018-03-06T16:20:47 <danayo> jessm: sorry I missed your ping yesterday - the rawgit url for discovery cats is no longer working, Justin_o and I discussed it recently but I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember where we left it - you can run it locally if you follow the steps laid out in github
2018-03-06T16:21:07 <danayo> or maybe you fixed it Justin_o ? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t checked recently
2018-03-06T16:22:27 <Justin_o> danayo, jessm: i didn\'t fix the rawgit url, but I did verify with the students that it works locally. We had talked a bit about the possibility of alanharnum setting up our own hosting for it.
2018-03-06T16:22:45 <danayo> oh that\xe2\x80\x99s right, thanks Justin_o
2018-03-06T16:26:05 * qquuiinn joined the channel
2018-03-06T16:35:53 <jessm> danayo: no worries. i passed the url along to the gsoc-ers anyway so they could see the code

2018-03-06T16:36:26 <jessm> many of them are in the SJRK Slack channel at #gsoc -- it\'s helpful in that when they join they can all see the history of the convo with links and such
2018-03-06T16:36:50 <jessm> i\'m also here for folks -- having finally gotten a web-based irc that does some notifications (at least some)

2018-03-06T18:41:18 <grrrero> jhung: Saw it, thanks a lot!
2018-03-06T18:42:24 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: yes, they can apply for more than one of our projects, but they would need to submit separate proposals

2018-03-06T19:03:19 <jhung> I have a newbie Slack question for those of you using it - how do you create a direct message to two or more people? Whenever I select a recipient, Slack automatically opens the previous conversation I had with that individual.
2018-03-06T19:03:45 <gmoss> jhung: I think you\'d want to create a private channel
2018-03-06T19:03:56 <gmoss> and invite them to it
2018-03-06T19:04:05 <jessm> jhung: we did it in the Pressbooks channel -- how\'d we do that?
2018-03-06T19:04:35 * YehchanP joined the channel
2018-03-06T19:04:37 <jessm> jhung: it wasn\'t a channel, it was a direct message

2018-03-06T19:05:12 <jhung> jessm: exactly. I want to do something like that.
2018-03-06T19:05:29 <jessm> jhung: it looks like you click on the \'+\' for direct message and then you type in the names of the peeps you want
2018-03-06T19:06:43 <jessm> YehchanP: rutvi: hiya!
2018-03-06T19:06:45 <jhung> jessm: that\'s where I\'m stuck.
2018-03-06T19:06:57 <jessm> where are you jhung? what channel?
2018-03-06T19:07:04 <jhung> Pressbooks jessm
2018-03-06T19:07:29 <jhung> grrrero agrees that it\'s weird, so it isn\'t just me. Makes me feel better about myself. :D
2018-03-06T19:07:45 <jessm> ohhhhhhhh, i see! jhung grrrero gmoss
2018-03-06T19:08:12 <jhung> jessm: see? Do you need special privs to send DMs to more than 1 person?
2018-03-06T19:08:20 <jhung> Makes no sense.
2018-03-06T19:09:07 <jessm> jhung: we can figure this out! https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212281468-Direct-messages-and-group-DMs
2018-03-06T19:09:54 <jessm> jhung: maybe try scrolling instead of typing in the name?
2018-03-06T19:11:35 <jhung> grrrero helped figure it jessm. It\'s a configuration issue on the PB channel.
2018-03-06T19:11:55 <jhung> on that link you sent jessm there\'s a note at the bottom that says: "Note: Single-Channel Guests can be added\xc2\xa0to group DMs but they can\'t start one on their own.\xc2\xa0"
2018-03-06T19:12:03 <jessm> yep, just saw that too
2018-03-06T19:12:29 <jhung> Such a strange limitation
2018-03-06T19:13:07 <jhung> I\'ll let Ned know. I can\'t start a conversation with him and Justin_o in slack with a single channel. Thanks jessm and grrrero!
2018-03-06T19:13:29 <jessm> jhung: i\'m checking the SJRK to see what the default is

2018-03-06T19:22:14 <jhung> alanharnum: is 11a to 12p ET Friday okay to chat w Boris?
