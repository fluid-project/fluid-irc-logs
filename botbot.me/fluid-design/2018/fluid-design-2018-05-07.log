2018-05-07T20:54:14 <simonjb> nice!
2018-05-07T20:54:42 <gtirloni> neuralmilkhotel: how is the build process happening? i see it's deploying the 'master' branch directly
2018-05-07T20:56:00 <neuralmilkhotel> Yup alanharnum set it as the master branch of inclusive-design/website-cities

2018-05-07T15:33:12 <jhung> Sounds great danayo. Can you give me a brief description of both of those so I can include them in an email?

2018-05-07T16:02:05 <danayo> cool jhung
2018-05-07T16:05:47 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks for sharing.. I wonder why we think of sonifiying the lightbulb and not the voltmeter.. is it because it's the most obvious item, or is there a specific pedegocial reason?
2018-05-07T16:06:04 * colinclark has quit
2018-05-07T16:08:38 <jhung> Justin_o: Good question. What the sim doesn't show currently is the fact the volt meter is hidden initially and can be added to the circuit using a checkbox. That's a new feature which hasn't been implemented yet.
2018-05-07T16:08:54 <Justin_o> ah okay
2018-05-07T16:09:36 <jhung> The primary learning objective is to understand induced charge and flux. The polarity of the current (as measured by the volt meter) is a secondary learning objective.
2018-05-07T16:10:23 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks for the clarification

2018-05-07T17:37:28 <danayo> though it\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on icons
