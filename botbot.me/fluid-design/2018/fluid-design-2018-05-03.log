2018-05-03T15:13:14 <sepidehshahi> He has sent me a couple of emails so I can use the meeting time to go over those emails with him

Yesterday was mainly spent adding new tests and rearranging old ones for the new grades associated with SJRK-84, and the community meeting in the afternoon. Today is a bit of a write-off so far, but assuming I get some time to work, I\'ll be continuing to add tests for the new grades.

2018-05-03T17:14:05 <danayo> sepidehshahi, simonjb and everyone: perhaps relevant to our inclusive cities work, re: Medell\xc3\xadn, Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s revitalisation:
2018-05-03T17:14:07 <danayo> Medell\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 and 1999 strategic plans set a new agenda for the city. \xe2\x80\x9cThey redefined the realm of what \xe2\x80\x98public work\xe2\x80\x99 is. Participatory planning became a key question of social equity,\xe2\x80\x9d Ortiz explains. In 1998, it became constitutional law in Colombia that every municipality had to develop a masterplan, and that planning could not happen without social participation.

2018-05-03T17:45:29 <jessm> gtirloni: ping
2018-05-03T17:45:36 <gtirloni> jessm: hi
2018-05-03T17:45:51 <jessm> gtirloni: should i go to another channel to chat with you about the community mailing list?
2018-05-03T17:46:06 <gtirloni> it\'s fine here
2018-05-03T17:46:48 <jessm> filtering is on for attachments with matching extension and then the list includes .doc and .docx among others -- it\'s why my attachment isn\'t going through. has something changed or is there something different I should do?
2018-05-03T17:47:33 <gtirloni> I haven\'t changed the settings
2018-05-03T17:47:46 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-05-03T17:48:03 <jessm> oh, nor have i. i am just wondering what is the best practice here?
2018-05-03T17:48:12 <jessm> is it ok if i cherry pick which extensions to exclude?
2018-05-03T17:48:56 <gtirloni> that\'s okay, but i don\'t see doc/docx excluded
2018-05-03T17:49:14 <jessm> under this: Remove message attachments that have a matching filename extension.
2018-05-03T17:49:22 <jessm> in content filtering
2018-05-03T17:51:18 <gtirloni> i think i\'m looking at the wrong list
2018-05-03T17:51:44 <jessm> gtirloni: https://lists.idrc.ocadu.ca/mailman/admin/community/contentfilter
2018-05-03T17:51:53 <gtirloni> yeah, i was looking at the "idi-community" list
2018-05-03T17:51:55 <gtirloni> thanjs
2018-05-03T17:52:06 <jessm> ahhh
2018-05-03T17:52:55 <gtirloni> word/excel can carry macro viruses but nowadays.. i don\'t know, might be okay i think
2018-05-03T17:53:06 <gtirloni> one alternative is to convert to pdf
2018-05-03T17:53:45 <jessm> gtirloni: i was thinking of doing that, but it\'s someone else\'s doc and i\'m not sure how accessible it would be converted to PDF
2018-05-03T17:54:03 <gtirloni> got it. so i think removing word from the exclude list is the way to go
2018-05-03T17:54:30 <jessm> ok, thanks gtirloni i\'ll do that and keep an eye out for nefarious .docs and .docxs :)

2018-05-03T18:08:50 <gtirloni> oh, and "Remove message attachments that don\'t have a matching filename extension", need to add "doc" and "docx" there too
2018-05-03T18:09:01 <gtirloni> the list is pretty locked down since when it started
