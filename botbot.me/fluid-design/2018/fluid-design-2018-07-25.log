2018-07-25T20:27:47 <Caren_> jhung is there a structure I should follow for uploading and styling level 2 content? I\xe2\x80\x99m still a little confused because when I look at One is Fun (resources) the content is uploaded but it\xe2\x80\x99s all rendering as a link, including the H1, intro text, byline.

2018-07-25T20:39:14 <jhung> Caren_: The way I would do it would be to copy the text from the source (i.e. Google Docs), paste the text into a plain old text editor, then copy from that text editor and paste into Wordpress.
2018-07-25T20:39:44 <jhung> The pasting into the text editor and copying from it will hopefully clean the formatting.
2018-07-25T20:40:01 <Caren_> ah, great, thanks for that tip jhung Will try that! :-)
2018-07-25T20:47:10 <jhung> Caren_: I see there's a bug with the breadcrumbs. Not sure what is causing it right now. Just letting you know I am aware of it and will look into it.
2018-07-25T20:47:51 <Caren_> ok, got it. Thanks jhung

2018-07-25T20:00:20 <michelled> oh cool jhung - does that mean those final issues you were working on are done?
2018-07-25T20:04:40 <jhung> michelled: almost. There is one more issue related to the sidebar.
2018-07-25T20:05:37 <Caren_> thanks jhung Content (white area to right of sidebar) seems to have been transformed into one big link for all the articles. Strange. I will continue to upload content and file a Jira for that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a few minutes to check the hover state, etc.
2018-07-25T20:07:03 <jhung> Caren_: ok I see. Give me a sec\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-07-25T20:08:25 <jhung> Caren_: I see. It's only doing that for pages that don't have any body content. If you choose a different article, it will show properly.
2018-07-25T20:09:08 <jhung> Caren_: It only seems like all articles because the sidebar shows all articles. I'll work on the sidebar fix to not go deeper than 2 levels next week.
2018-07-25T20:10:02 <Caren_> jhung: yup it\xe2\x80\x99s the articles\xe2\x80\xa6the ones fully posted are rendering as linked copy
2018-07-25T20:10:22 * clown has quit
2018-07-25T20:10:48 <jhung> Yes it is. If you go to Inclusive Classroom > 3.1.1.9 9 steps, you can see it render properly.
2018-07-25T20:10:53 <jhung> ^ Caren_
2018-07-25T20:10:59 <jhung> So technically not a bug. :)
2018-07-25T20:11:03 <jhung> Just missing content.
2018-07-25T20:11:05 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-07-25T20:15:31 <Caren_> ok jhung I see. thanks. Should I be looking at things like body copy spacing you adjusted (following a list spacing will be 1.5 rem), hover and select states?
2018-07-25T20:16:42 <jhung> Caren_: sure. If you see anything out of the ordinary, let me know. Keep in mind that copy-and-paste from google docs might affect the formatting because it embeds the styling into the markup.
2018-07-25T20:16:57 <jhung> We would have to clean those instances up on a case-by-case basis
2018-07-25T20:17:47 <Caren_> ok, got it.  :) + :(
2018-07-25T20:19:50 <Caren_> Yup I am going to have to comb through the content once it\xe2\x80\x99s uploaded to try and strip out the styling\xe2\x80\xa6or re-upload raw, unstyled content jhung
