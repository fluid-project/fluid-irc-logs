2018-03-27T13:58:08 <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit will be starting in 2 minutes. We will be talking about co-design experiences today.

2018-03-27T17:59:20 <alanharnum> entirely possible this has been shared before, but it\'s a really comprehensive list of "publicly available design systems and pattern libraries".

2018-03-27T18:27:16 <danayo> sepidehshahi: did you have futher thoughts or ideas about the create-a-thon entry? I realised after the planning meeting that I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure where you left it - I see your chat in the IRC about putting in the ILDH, but referencing it in a Guide activity
2018-03-27T18:29:16 <sepidehshahi> actually no danayo. let me have a look at the google doc to see how we can use it in both the Guide and ILDH
2018-03-27T18:29:44 <danayo> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t created a google doc sepidehshahi - just what\xe2\x80\x99s on the wiki I think
2018-03-27T18:29:48 <danayo> but I can
2018-03-27T18:29:53 <danayo> if it would be useful
2018-03-27T18:29:59 <sepidehshahi> sorrry, yes I meant the wiki :)
2018-03-27T18:30:08 <danayo> ok

2018-03-27T18:44:12 <sepidehshahi> danayo: and jhung I see the Create-a-Thon Guide entry more as a tool than an activity. I think these two sections can be groupped as a tool in the Guide: Create-a-Thons and Hackathons + Setting up a CaT and we can list Communication steps as tips. The entire document can be added to the ILDH in the same section as the Inclusive Making and Hacking
2018-03-27T18:45:29 <danayo> I agree sepidehshahi, because it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a general method than a specific activity
2018-03-27T18:45:45 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo - makes sense
2018-03-27T18:46:04 <sepidehshahi> exactly

2018-03-27T19:08:37 <danayo> sepidehshahi, jhung: I created a google doc for the CaT stuff - seems like a better place to edit and organise content https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSrWuRqFT63K96-FZZl0oqiUIO_5CqKDvLF2zW4Qq3o/edit?usp=sharing
2018-03-27T19:09:29 <sepidehshahi> thanks danayo
2018-03-27T19:09:38 <jhung> Thanks danayo! I\'ll contribute to that as I have time.
2018-03-27T19:10:39 <danayo> sounds good jhung, me too

2018-03-27T19:14:53 <danayo> good idea sepidehshahi - I\xe2\x80\x99ll email her
