2018-09-13T15:57:08 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I missed standup today, so here's my update: Yesterday I did some final review on the FLOE news article, then Justin took a look at it and made a few suggestions upon which I then acted. I also worked on FLUID-6300 trying to implement a change that Justin requested for that Jira, but I think it may have to be spun off into its own issue. Today I plan to spend at most 30 exploring the viability of adding
2018-09-13T15:57:08 <gmoss> this new change, and then forge ahead with the tests for the localized UIO component.
