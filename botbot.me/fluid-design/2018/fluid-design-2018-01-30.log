b'2018-01-30T21:21:03 <simonjb> initial application of patterns to software were in the context of Smalltalk and the idea that "end-users" would modify their systems
2018-01-30T21:21:19 <simonjb> but in the software application, that has mostly been lost
2018-01-30T21:21:39 <colinclark_> i\'m so excited to read this discussion :)
2018-01-30T21:22:01 <danayo_> very cool simonjb - complexifying the user!
2018-01-30T21:22:08 <simonjb> in Alexander sense, patterns are no longer being used by the people who will use the buildings
2018-01-30T21:22:15 <simonjb> but by developers
2018-01-30T21:22:55 * alanharnum has quit
2018-01-30T21:23:21 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-30T21:24:03 <danayo_> so we can start to imagine how "the people" might use patterns
2018-01-30T21:24:11 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-01-30T21:24:28 <danayo_> as one of the creative user rights
2018-01-30T21:24:36 * cindyli has quit
2018-01-30T21:24:49 <simonjb> it would be interesting to think of a pattern language for infusion that thought both about implementation strategies as well as higher level relationships to a system
2018-01-30T21:25:23 <simonjb> danayo_: I was thinking of something different (though that is interesting also)
2018-01-30T21:25:51 <simonjb> I was thinking more of what we might think of creative user rights as being individual patterns
2018-01-30T21:26:21 <simonjb> I want to be able to have this relationship with a system and here are ways that that could be accomplished
2018-01-30T21:27:09 <simonjb> so, say a pattern for being able to swap part of a system\'s functionality
2018-01-30T21:29:08 <danayo_> ok, I think I\'m with you simonjb - I like this - so a creative user right is defined by, or rather, made possible through, a particluar pattern?
2018-01-30T21:29:16 <simonjb> yes
2018-01-30T21:30:28 <danayo_> very cool simonjb
2018-01-30T21:31:34 <simonjb> "Alexander proposes homes and offices be designed and built by their eventual occupants. These people, he reasons, know best their requirements for a particular structure. We agree, and make the same argument for computer programs. Computer users should write their own programs. The idea sounds foolish when one considers the size and complexity of both buildings and programs, and the years of training for the design professions. Yet
2018-01-30T21:31:34 <simonjb> Alexander offers a convincing scenario."
2018-01-30T21:31:42 <simonjb> http://c2.com/doc/oopsla87.html
2018-01-30T21:31:57 <simonjb> this I think is the first application of patterns to software
2018-01-30T21:32:00 <simonjb> in 1987
2018-01-30T21:32:09 <simonjb> Beck and Cunningham
2018-01-30T21:35:48 <simonjb> danayo_: I had initially thought of a pattern language at the lower level, code structure, but I think it would be valuable to draw paths from that level upwards, or outwards to higher level concerns/strategies/goals
2018-01-30T21:36:16 <simonjb> and that made me think of the idea of creative user rights
2018-01-30T21:37:05 <simonjb> and there might be a connection there
2018-01-30T21:38:04 <danayo_> simonjb: do you imagine that a creative user right might require a collection or series of lower/code-level patterns? so it might sort of branch out into multiple patterns ... or ?
2018-01-30T21:39:36 <danayo_> I find this definition helpful: "A pattern language ... is a sequence of bits of knowledge written in a style and arranged in an order which leads a designer to ask (and answer) the right questions at the right time"
2018-01-30T21:39:39 <simonjb> danayo_: I don\'t have a good sense yet, perhaps that: these patterns are options for realizing this pattern -- but I think it would be clearer with some actual real things
2018-01-30T21:39:57 <simonjb> danayo_: yes, I like that description also
2018-01-30T21:42:12 <danayo_> some actual, real things perhaps being ideas for creative user rights, simonjb?
2018-01-30T21:42:18 <simonjb> yes
2018-01-30T21:43:10 <simonjb> this article is interesting also: https://dl-acm-org.ocadu.idm.oclc.org/citation.cfm?id=1699782 (on ACM digital library, probably needs log into OCAD)
2018-01-30T21:43:37 <simonjb> it discusses patterns as applied to user experience
2018-01-30T21:44:02 <simonjb> and argues that that is closer to Alexander\'s architectural intention
2018-01-30T21:44:17 <danayo_> thanks
2018-01-30T21:44:37 <simonjb> but I\'m thinking it\'s interesting in the context of infusion not to make a separation between developer and end-user
2018-01-30T21:45:26 <simonjb> that we could make a pattern language that spanned a range of relationships to a software system
2018-01-30T21:45:47 <simonjb> not simply user or developer
2018-01-30T21:49:06 <danayo_> definitely simonjb  (also relates to the recent email thread about the word "user")
2018-01-30T21:49:09 <danayo_> and could there also be room for the "user" to define or customize a new relationship? some kind of pattern building blocks?
2018-01-30T21:49:19 <danayo_> if that makes sense
2018-01-30T21:50:03 <simonjb> yes, that would be interesting to explore
2018-01-30T21:50:19 <simonjb> and definitely related to the "user" thread
2018-01-30T21:53:09 <danayo_> simonjb: I can start a wiki page with some ideas for creative user rights (starting with your recent examples colinclark_, if that\'s ok with you)
2018-01-30T21:54:15 <simonjb> awesome danayo_
2018-01-30T21:58:14 * alanharnum joined the channel

2018-01-30T22:28:55 <colinclark_> danayo: I love your thoughts on the "user" discussion on our mailing list
2018-01-30T22:28:58 <colinclark_> really great
2018-01-30T22:29:30 <danayo> oh right simonjb
2018-01-30T22:29:38 <danayo> thanks colinclark_ !
2018-01-30T22:30:37 <colinclark_> this Don Norman article is referenced in the Olia article, but I dug it up earlier today and flipped through it when i was contemplating the thread: http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/words_matter_talk_about_people_not_customers_not_consumers_not_users.html
2018-01-30T22:31:21 <colinclark_> it reminded me of alanharnum2\'s concern for terms like "guest" which are euphemisms for certains of disempowered roles in a relationship
2018-01-30T22:32:09 <colinclark_> something i mentioned to simonjb in relation to my first visit to mcdonald\'s for the first time in probably at least 20 years, maybe 25
2018-01-30T22:32:21 <colinclark_> where they referred to me as a "guest"
2018-01-30T22:32:47 <colinclark_> despite having ordered my "meal" from a giant ipad instead of a person :)
2018-01-30T22:33:12 <alanharnum2> have you read or heard of https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520272941, colinclark_?
2018-01-30T22:33:31 <colinclark_> nope and nope
2018-01-30T22:33:40 <colinclark_> but it looks interesting, alanharnum2
2018-01-30T22:34:01 * gtirloni has quit
2018-01-30T22:34:45 <alanharnum2> it\'s an interesting read in light of how language like "guest" gets deployed by big corporations
2018-01-30T22:35:31 <colinclark_> yes
2018-01-30T22:35:38 <simonjb> "customers have 20 minutes to finish their food" https://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/16/mcdonalds-institutes-time-limit-for-eating.html
2018-01-30T22:37:40 <danayo> wow simonjb
2018-01-30T22:38:04 <danayo> the 20-minute guest
2018-01-30T22:40:41 <colinclark_> that\'s bleak
2018-01-30T22:41:52 <simonjb> sorry, it was pretty bleak :(
2018-01-30T22:42:36 <colinclark_> :)
2018-01-30T22:42:47 <colinclark_> I\'m pretty ambivalent about this Don Norman article
2018-01-30T22:43:09 <colinclark_> I\'m glad Olia prepared me for acceptance of radical ambivalence in regards to this whole idea of "user"
2018-01-30T22:43:37 <colinclark_> I really don\'t believe that recourse to words like "people" and "human" does anything to address the essential problem
2018-01-30T22:44:39 <colinclark_> and indeed it\'s interesting to see how the concept of "human," as something distinct from technical systems, has really be constituted in a curious way by computers
2018-01-30T22:44:50 <colinclark_> via terms like HCI and so on
2018-01-30T22:45:23 <colinclark_> but on the other hand i resonate with a lot of the argument
2018-01-30T22:45:53 <colinclark_> and especially, as a kind of position, the idea that "All deserve their share of dignity. Their roles can be specified in other ways."
2018-01-30T22:46:55 <colinclark_> we\'re going to need abstract or very general words sometimes
2018-01-30T22:47:05 <colinclark_> and "user" certainly isn\'t the worst of them :)
2018-01-30T22:47:44 <danayo> explorers, users, designers, modifiers, mixers, learners \xe2\x80\xa6 ?
2018-01-30T22:47:48 <colinclark_> but i love that there might be times when the generalized concept might be "learner" (as per danayo) or "co-designer" (as per jutta)
2018-01-30T22:47:50 <colinclark_> yes
2018-01-30T22:48:09 <colinclark_> my sense is that when we encounter the abstraction of the term "user," we might ask...
2018-01-30T22:48:14 <colinclark_> who\'s missing here?
2018-01-30T22:48:19 <colinclark_> just like with what I\'ve mentioned about personas
2018-01-30T22:48:31 <colinclark_> they\'re very powerful abstractions when someone can\'t be here for some reason
2018-01-30T22:48:39 <colinclark_> but you also have to ask, why aren\'t they here?
2018-01-30T22:48:59 <colinclark_> and then the question starts to shift into "what role would you like to play here?"
2018-01-30T22:48:59 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-01-30T22:49:17 <colinclark_> and with that specificity, terms become clearer\xe2\x80\x94and can be negotiated and discussed
2018-01-30T22:50:17 <colinclark_> but you know, personally, i\'d far rather be a "user" of some of our software than a "guest" a mcdonald\'s
2018-01-30T22:50:29 <danayo> haha
2018-01-30T22:50:50 <danayo> user with a side of fries?
2018-01-30T22:51:11 <simonjb> this is a minor point, but it might be interesting to share -- I disagree with his assertion that "staying four nights" is a hotel-centered statement -- I want to think in those terms often because it helps me calculate how much my bill will be
2018-01-30T22:51:17 <colinclark_> yes
2018-01-30T22:51:31 <colinclark_> or how many sleeps \'til you get home :)
2018-01-30T22:51:34 <simonjb> yes
2018-01-30T22:51:51 <colinclark_> this idea of one size fits one is really important
2018-01-30T22:51:53 <simonjb> there are different views on the data
2018-01-30T22:51:56 <colinclark_> it\'s so easy to see it as a kind of buzzword
2018-01-30T22:51:58 <simonjb> yes, exactly
2018-01-30T22:52:04 <colinclark_> but it\'s not
2018-01-30T22:52:39 <colinclark_> it\'s about a conversation that can happen between people and their environment
2018-01-30T22:52:54 <colinclark_> "views on the data," exactly, simonjb
2018-01-30T22:53:16 <danayo> unfortunately I have to run - I will catch up on this super interesting conversation when I\xe2\x80\x99m back!
2018-01-30T22:53:22 <colinclark_> no problem!

2018-01-30T17:47:01 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: when adding new resources from IRC and email to the resource page I noticed something that I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to treat that. Some times when a resource (book, video, article, etc.) is shared, others start sharing relevant content to it. So, do you think we should list those extra resources separately or is there any way that we can link these inputs in the macro or any other way?
2018-01-30T17:47:39 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: for the moment, I\'d be inclined to just list them separately, maybe grouping them under related headings
2018-01-30T17:48:10 <alanharnum> this is another area where I think if we want more complex features (about resources being related to one another, etc), we probably should be using something with more hierarchy than a wiki page to gather them
2018-01-30T17:48:16 <alanharnum> IMO
2018-01-30T17:49:35 <sepidehshahi> I totally agree alanharnum. So far, I have been groupping them under similar headings for the type of the content (Books, websites, artcles) but I can add more specific heading as well in the future.
2018-01-30T17:49:51 <sepidehshahi> thanks

2018-01-30T19:05:35 <alanharnum> this is focused on Arabic specifically, but has a lot of relevant material in general for RTL UX, design and implementation: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/designing-for-the-arab-user-basic-arabic-ux-for-business-6ff29d4c7c60

2018-01-30T19:37:18 <Caren_> great, thanks alanharnum !
2018-01-30T19:40:20 <gmoss> alanharnum: very cool article! I like the Noto font as well, I\'d never heard of it, but it\'s great to see the immense number of languages and regions supported by it
2018-01-30T19:46:11 <Justin_o> jhung: would you be able to help me with the UIO+ icon
2018-01-30T19:46:23 <Justin_o> it seems we need an additional size/version for the chrome webstore
2018-01-30T19:48:41 <Justin_o> jhung: actually i might have to talk to sepideh about it.. i don\'t see the ai files for them in ownCloud, only the pngs

2018-01-30T20:22:11 <Caren_> hi Justin_o : I\xe2\x80\x99m going to post the reflection articles the first co-op students wrote on the SNOW site sometime in the near future. I was thinking it might be nice to include a link to the site they created. Is that ok? If so, do you have a link I can include?
2018-01-30T20:25:05 <Caren_> yes! Justin_o
2018-01-30T20:25:18 <Justin_o> Caren_: i\'ll see if i can dig it up
2018-01-30T20:30:21 <Justin_o> Caren_: I believe this would correspond to the last version of their work https://cdn.rawgit.com/fluid-lab/oer-inclusive-design/02c49687ce942680a0c29cfa45c57aa6f16def37/home-page.html
2018-01-30T20:32:15 <Justin_o> the second set of co-op students continued on from their work, so what\'s in the repo is quite different now.. i think i should probably go and add tags to distinguish the different parts
2018-01-30T20:33:01 <Caren_> ah, ok. Is that a big job?
2018-01-30T20:33:17 <Caren_> I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to layer on work that isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary.
2018-01-30T20:33:43 <Caren_> Do you know if the second set of students wrote reflections?
2018-01-30T20:33:59 <Justin_o> it\'s not a lot of work, i\'ll do that now
2018-01-30T20:34:11 <Justin_o> regarding the second set, i\'m not aware of them having written reflections
2018-01-30T20:34:25 <Caren_> I could publish all the refelctions and then link to the final site
2018-01-30T20:34:37 <Caren_> Ah, ok, thanks Justin_o
2018-01-30T20:35:22 <Justin_o> yah.. it\'s a bit of a shame though.. it would have been nice to have reflections from both sets

2018-01-30T21:13:09 <simonjb> hi danayo danayo_
2018-01-30T21:13:20 <danayo_> hi simonjb
2018-01-30T21:13:32 <simonjb> I\'m doing some prep for my patterns community meeting in a couple of weeks
2018-01-30T21:13:32 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-30T21:14:08 <simonjb> and am having some thoughts that I wanted to talk over with you
2018-01-30T21:14:33 <danayo_> sure simonjb
2018-01-30T21:15:05 <simonjb> I was chatting with colinclark_ about the "Turing Complete User" and he mentioned that he had been chatting with you about it
2018-01-30T21:15:23 <simonjb> and about thoughts of \'creative user rights\'
2018-01-30T21:15:57 <simonjb> and I\'m wondering if you had given more thought to that? if you had by any chance made a list?
2018-01-30T21:16:30 <simonjb> I\'m asking because I see a connection to an infusion pattern language
2018-01-30T21:16:44 <simonjb> that those things could be expressed as patterns
2018-01-30T21:17:00 <danayo_> I have not made a list simonjb! but...I can start one based on the conversation with colinclark_
2018-01-30T21:17:08 <danayo_> the connection to patterns sounds interestings

2018-01-30T21:18:04 <simonjb> in A Pattern Language, Alexander starts from big scale -- citys and towns and moves to smaller scales, to inside a home
2018-01-30T21:18:34 <simonjb> software application of patterns often focuses on programming implementation
2018-01-30T21:18:45 <simonjb> on the programmer as the user of patterns
2018-01-30T21:19:28 <simonjb> with infusion, I think it\'s interesting to think of the \'user\' as having different roles or relationships to a software system
2018-01-30T21:19:46 <simonjb> sometimes we want to use it as provided
2018-01-30T21:19:52 <simonjb> sometimes we want to adapt it
2018-01-30T21:20:10 <simonjb> sometimes we are not involved in the initial design
2018-01-30T21:20:13 <simonjb> sometimes we are
