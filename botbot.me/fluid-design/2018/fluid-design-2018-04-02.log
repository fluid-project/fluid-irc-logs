2018-04-02T17:16:33 <danayo> hi jhung, colinclark: just emailed you about the guide activitiy PR\xe2\x80\x99s - jutta was asking if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been added yet - she needs them for some workshops - on Wednesday I believe
2018-04-02T17:18:45 <jhung> danayo: is it sufficient I verify that the site works with the content? I won't have time to proof read the content itself.
2018-04-02T17:20:40 <danayo> I think so jhung. I think we can always make changes later if needed, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty true to what Jutta had suggested originally
2018-04-02T17:21:59 <jhung> ok danayo. I'll take a look at those now
2018-04-02T17:24:18 <danayo> thanks jhung!
2018-04-02T17:55:02 <jhung> danayo: I left a commit on FLOE-545. There are files that should not be included in the commit.
2018-04-02T17:55:49 <danayo> ok jhung
2018-04-02T17:57:15 <danayo> jhung - is it the DS_store files? I thought we had successfully removed those
2018-04-02T17:57:48 <jhung> there was still one left danayo in the activities directory. There is also a package.lock file
2018-04-02T17:59:17 <danayo> ok jhung, thanks. do I need to do anything to correct it now?
2018-04-02T17:59:43 <danayo> (I will add them to .gitignore)
2018-04-02T18:02:16 <jhung> Ok. danayo once you've updated your .gitignore file, you will need to manually remove those two files from being tracked by git. You can do this by: git rm --cached <file>
2018-04-02T18:02:23 <jhung> See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1274057/how-to-make-git-forget-about-a-file-that-was-tracked-but-is-now-in-gitignore for more info.
2018-04-02T18:03:00 <jhung> Disclaimer - I'm not a git expert. I usually rely on justin_o. :D
2018-04-02T18:03:10 <danayo> :)
2018-04-02T18:03:38 <danayo> yeah Justin_o helped me to remove them the last time, but somehow we must have missed those

2018-04-02T18:12:20 <danayo> jhung: how do I update my gitignore file? :p
2018-04-02T18:12:57 <jhung> are you using Atom as an editor danayo?
2018-04-02T18:14:27 <jhung> What editor are you using danayo?
2018-04-02T18:14:38 <danayo> I was using BBEdit
2018-04-02T18:15:49 <danayo> but I just downloaded Atom jhung, and opened the project, and I can see the gitignore file
