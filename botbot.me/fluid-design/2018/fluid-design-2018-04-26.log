2018-04-26T16:38:32 <neuralmilkhotel> Hi colinclark, do you think we can create a JIRA project for Inclusive Cities? (and following that a Github repo afterwards)
2018-04-26T16:38:54 <colinclark> Hmm, good question
2018-04-26T16:38:59 <colinclark> what have we done for other websites?
2018-04-26T16:39:11 <colinclark> a component in JIRA, or a completely separate project?
2018-04-26T16:39:23 <neuralmilkhotel> SJRK and SNOW both have JIRA  projects
2018-04-26T16:40:43 <colinclark> yes, I think it would be fine to create a project for it, then
2018-04-26T16:41:20 <neuralmilkhotel> Sounds good
2018-04-26T16:42:15 <colinclark> avtar probably has the permissions to create a new project if you need it, neuralmilkhotel
2018-04-26T16:42:33 <neuralmilkhotel> Okay colinclark !
2018-04-26T16:42:42 <neuralmilkhotel> Ping avtar :)
2018-04-26T16:43:29 <michelled> I can do it neuralmilkhotel
2018-04-26T16:43:42 <michelled> what should the \'key\' be?
2018-04-26T16:43:55 <michelled> meaning for cities?
2018-04-26T16:44:01 <michelled> CITY
2018-04-26T16:44:05 <colinclark> sure :)
2018-04-26T16:44:11 <neuralmilkhotel> I\'m good with that
2018-04-26T16:48:12 <michelled> it should be there - let me know if there are any issues with it
2018-04-26T16:48:26 <neuralmilkhotel> Thanks michelled !!!
2018-04-26T16:48:38 <michelled> np
2018-04-26T16:50:28 <michelled> gmoss, danayo: the old content for the SJRK site would be archived already by git: https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org/blob/master/activity.html
2018-04-26T16:51:19 <gmoss> michelled, danayo: very true. I wonder if it would be valuable to have it in a more "human readable" format on the wiki, all the same?
2018-04-26T16:51:47 <gmoss> it might be complicated to have a \'grid\' of the various partner organizations and historical updates
2018-04-26T16:52:05 <gmoss> both visually and wrt maintainign it
2018-04-26T16:52:07 <gmoss> *maintaining
2018-04-26T16:54:15 <avtar> neuralmilkhotel, michelled: sorry, just saw that ping
2018-04-26T16:54:31 <neuralmilkhotel> It\'s all good avtar :D

2018-04-26T17:10:00 <danayo> gmoss, michelled, alanharnum: re: archiving the activities, I was thinking more of a place on the website where visitors could see all the past activiites
2018-04-26T17:10:25 <michelled> ah, interesting, yes, that might be nice

2018-04-26T18:04:34 <colinclark> this one, neuralmilkhotel: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
2018-04-26T18:04:43 <neuralmilkhotel> Thanks colinclark !
2018-04-26T18:04:51 <colinclark> this page has a lot of material in it: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Licensing
2018-04-26T18:05:00 <colinclark> not easy to read, but has all the licensing details, etc.
2018-04-26T18:06:46 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: For the Github repo we\'d use the ECL 2.0 and 3-Clause BSD licenses as well?
2018-04-26T18:07:05 <colinclark> no
2018-04-26T18:07:15 <colinclark> If there is any code, that should be 3-clause BSD alone
2018-04-26T18:07:23 <neuralmilkhotel> Okay
2018-04-26T18:07:25 <colinclark> the site content itself is CC
2018-04-26T18:08:00 <neuralmilkhotel> Code = 3-Clause BSD, Content = CC
