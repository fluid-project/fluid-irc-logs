2018-01-15T17:06:12 <gmoss> colinclark: I think you're home free :) if we come to a point in the discussion where we require your presence, we can let you know
2018-01-15T17:06:17 <colinclark> ha, thanks :)
2018-01-15T17:06:25 <gmoss> sorry for tagging you unnecessarily
2018-01-15T17:06:33 <danayo_> we'll say colinclark  WE NEED YOU
2018-01-15T17:06:38 <colinclark> hahaha
2018-01-15T17:06:41 <colinclark> oh wow
2018-01-15T17:06:44 <colinclark> it's so good to be needed
2018-01-15T17:06:48 <danayo_> :D
2018-01-15T17:06:52 <colinclark> if you end up not needing me, it will be so sad
2018-01-15T17:08:13 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: do you have a minute to quickly clarify something about icons in high contrast?
2018-01-15T17:09:46 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: sure
2018-01-15T17:09:54 <Justin_o> call me when you're ready
2018-01-15T17:09:58 <sepidehshahi> thanks

2018-01-15T17:58:26 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: I was checking our current globe icon. It is definitely not very accurate. however, I suggest not modifying it because in that case it becomes precise and very North American centeric. I found other representations of the globe using other continents. So, If you prefer, I can use those instead. here is an example: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=globe&i=658497
2018-01-15T18:00:25 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: okay, lets leave it as is for now
2018-01-15T18:00:33 <Justin_o> thanks for investigating
2018-01-15T18:00:37 <sepidehshahi> sure :)

2018-01-15T19:21:11 <gmoss> alanharn_ michelled I'm experiencing a bit of a snafu at the moment
2018-01-15T19:21:58 <gmoss> I locked myself out of the house after grabbing lunch and shoveling the walkway haha.. I'll try to find a solution, but I don't think I'll be able to join for part ii of the discussion
2018-01-15T19:25:15 <alanharn_> gmoss: ok! i'd focus on staying warm more than anything else under the circumstances!
2018-01-15T19:29:55 <alanharn_> we can also resume meeting at a later time
2018-01-15T19:31:57 * danayo joined the channel
2018-01-15T19:32:18 <gmoss> alanharn_: I've found a solution, should be back inside in 20~30 minutes
2018-01-15T19:32:46 <alanharn_> danayo gmoss milchelled: OK, why don't we resume at 3 then, if that works for danayo and michelled
2018-01-15T19:32:50 <gmoss> If you're willing to postpone that would be great. In the meantime I've taken up refuge in the mall across the street :) what an adventure hah
2018-01-15T19:33:14 <danayo> sounds good to me. good luck gmoss!

2018-01-15T20:01:34 <gmoss> danayo alanharn_ michelled I'm still waiting at the mall, unfortunately. Very sorry about all of this. I'll let you know once I'm back at home.
2018-01-15T20:01:46 <gmoss> Please feel free to continue without me
2018-01-15T20:04:32 <alanharn_> gmoss: no worries! we can resume once you're available again.
2018-01-15T20:19:41 <gmoss> home safe, ready to meet in 5!
2018-01-15T20:20:11 <michelled> excellent!
2018-01-15T20:20:29 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, do you have some time to meet about MyL3 today or tomorrow?
2018-01-15T20:21:59 <michelled> gmoss, danayo: it looks like we will have to wait until 4:00 to resume.
2018-01-15T20:23:16 <gmoss> michelled: indeed. I'm still good. considering this delay, i'll be working well into the evening haha.. so I'll be good to meet any time. I'll keep poking away at my model relay issue, until then
2018-01-15T20:26:26 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi - can we plan to meet tomorrow at 1:30 ET?
2018-01-15T20:26:46 <sepidehshahi> sounds great! thanks danayo

2018-01-15T21:07:51 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: please see this. I tried thickening the lines and added two new ideas, which seems clearer: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/wUnw0Mh6NJXns4J
2018-01-15T21:08:53 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: is there supposed to be an icon on the first adjuster panel?
2018-01-15T21:09:29 <sepidehshahi> no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with another idea to fill that spot :P
2018-01-15T21:10:54 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi  :) okay
2018-01-15T21:11:23 <Justin_o> i think i prefer the last one still, but am open to what others think
2018-01-15T21:11:33 <Justin_o> also wondering if the width fits in the icon dimensions
2018-01-15T21:11:46 <Justin_o> for the font icon

2018-01-15T21:21:57 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: it\xe2\x80\x99s close to the real dimension but not 100% the same. So when you integrate it it might be a bit smaller.
2018-01-15T21:22:17 <Justin_o> okay
2018-01-15T21:22:30 <sepidehshahi> I can send you the assets, so you will see how they look like
2018-01-15T21:22:36 <Justin_o> thanks
2018-01-15T21:23:16 <sepidehshahi> by the way, I had to turn off the anti-aliasing option in illustrator. so, hopefully this time icons will be exported with the right size. I added that point to wiki page as well
2018-01-15T21:25:20 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: thanks for looking into that too
