2018-10-03T13:26:06 <carenwatkins_> Hi clown Do you have an invitation (or template email) you\'re sending out to folks inviting them to DEEP?
2018-10-03T13:27:07 <carenwatkins_> I\'d like to send something out to SNOW folks, if it hasn\'t already been done.

2018-10-03T13:35:37 <clown> Hi carenwatkins_ I just got back from coffee.  I\'ll forward you what I\'ve sent out.
2018-10-03T13:36:06 <carenwatkins_> Thanks clown! No rush, when you have a moment.
2018-10-03T13:36:19 <clown> it\'s oriented towareds "old timers", but maybe you can use it.  Or modify it as necessary.

2018-10-03T17:29:29 <gmoss> Justin_o: i realized that my feedback yesterday for the Presentation Translation was because you were the one who tagged "everyone", but I didn\'t notice that it was jess who initially shared the link and request. so many J\'s :)

2018-10-03T17:55:55 <Jess_> doh! gmoss looking\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-10-03T17:56:14 <Justin_o> gmoss: sure
2018-10-03T17:56:39 <gmoss> Justin_o: great. shall I call you directly?
2018-10-03T17:57:21 <Justin_o> gmoss: is michelle with you, or joining separately?
2018-10-03T17:57:26 <gmoss> she\'s here beside me
2018-10-03T17:57:30 <gmoss> sorry, should have mentioned
2018-10-03T17:57:41 <jhung> fluid-everyone: does anyone know how to resize a window to an exactly size? i.e. I want to a screen recording from Safari at 1920x1080.
2018-10-03T17:57:42 <Justin_o> okay sure
2018-10-03T18:03:11 <jhung> fluid-everyone: never mind. I just used the Display settings and scaled one of my displays to 1920x1080.
2018-10-03T18:06:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-10-03T18:08:25 <avtar> jhung: two options come to mind
2018-10-03T18:08:26 <avtar> ah nm
2018-10-03T18:10:15 <avtar> for future reference in case anyone\'s searching the logs, you can either use obs and set the resolution in settings -> video
2018-10-03T18:10:53 <avtar> or change the display resolution like you did
2018-10-03T18:11:12 <avtar> or if using quicktime player you can drag and select the recording area and set it to 1920x1080
2018-10-03T18:11:58 <jhung> avtar: that\'s super helpful. Perhaps dropping that somewhere in the wiki? Not sure where it should go however.
2018-10-03T18:14:47 <avtar> good idea

2018-10-03T21:06:56 <colinclark> it just came out at the end of september
