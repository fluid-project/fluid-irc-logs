2018-07-09T14:48:30 <sepidehshahi> np
2018-07-09T14:52:58 <danayo> sepidehshahi, simonjb: I might need to skip the MyL3 meeting today

2018-07-09T15:14:36 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I had forgotten that we have a lunch plan today. So we may have to reschedule MyL3 meeting for tomorrow after the planning. Are you available then?
2018-07-09T15:14:41 <sepidehshahi> simonjb ^
2018-07-09T15:15:50 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I have a lot of meetings in the morning tomorrow. I could possibly meet after 3ET but I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s too late for Jeevan
2018-07-09T15:20:23 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-07-09T15:21:04 <sepidehshahi> that might be too late for Jeevan. let me see if we can reschedule for Wednesday

2018-07-09T19:40:15 <danayo> colinclark, michelled: do you still want to meet about p-coop?
2018-07-09T19:40:21 <colinclark> no :)
2018-07-09T19:40:24 <danayo> :)
2018-07-09T19:40:26 <colinclark> I mean, yes
2018-07-09T19:40:34 <colinclark> but I think I just want to write some emails and this paper
2018-07-09T19:40:44 <colinclark> one of the emails is to reschedule the loconomics conversation a bit
2018-07-09T19:41:13 <colinclark> so that we have a bit more time to plan and map
2018-07-09T19:41:18 <colinclark> does that seem reasonable to you?
2018-07-09T19:41:26 <colinclark> i'm happy to chat now if it's helpful for you
2018-07-09T19:42:59 <danayo> colinclark: that sounds good to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing some mapping, and could probably use some feedback soon-ish. tomorrow-ish?
2018-07-09T19:43:11 <colinclark> tomorrow sounds good
2018-07-09T19:43:27 * cindyli has quit
2018-07-09T19:43:54 <michelled> if we aren't having the loconomics meeting tomorrow, I think I'll take the full day off
2018-07-09T19:43:58 <michelled> just let me know
2018-07-09T19:48:09 <danayo> colinclark, michelled: I just emailed you something I was playing around with (can\xe2\x80\x99t get owncloud to sync right now for some reason)
2018-07-09T19:48:16 <colinclark> awesome
2018-07-09T19:48:25 <michelled> thx
2018-07-09T19:50:06 <danayo> colinclark, michelled: I\xe2\x80\x99m focusing on mapping the bigger picture, but just wanted to sketch up an idea that came to mind
2018-07-09T19:58:26 <gmoss> ping michelled
2018-07-09T19:59:14 <gmoss> I'm wondering what time might be best for you today to talk about your review of my code. If today isn't going to work, maybe we can find a time tomorrow or later this week :)
2018-07-09T20:02:32 <michelled> gmoss: can we meet now?
2018-07-09T20:02:37 <gmoss> michelled: sure!
2018-07-09T20:02:59 <gmoss> just have to fire up Vidyo, forgot to this morning
2018-07-09T20:03:27 <gmoss> ready :)
