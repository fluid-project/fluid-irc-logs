2018-09-07T15:40:33 <clown> lliskovoi:  I\'m looking through the chat log and I can\'t find where you pinged me.
2018-09-07T15:40:58 <clown> maybe I was away or something.  can you send again?
2018-09-07T15:41:07 <lliskovoi> sent to you direct
2018-09-07T15:41:44 <lliskovoi> but it\'s basically same as what I said in standup
2018-09-07T15:42:24 <lliskovoi> clown, I can send you an email with the link and suggestion text, would that work?
2018-09-07T15:42:50 <clown> yes, \'cause I can\'t find any trace of your previous message.
2018-09-07T15:44:22 <lliskovoi> curiouser and curiouser

2018-09-07T15:47:51 <lliskovoi> thanks clown! I\'ll look through it!
2018-09-07T15:48:32 <lliskovoi> sent email, running to grab lunch, will be online just a bit after 1 if you\'d like to discuss

2018-09-07T18:04:56 <lliskovoi> fluid-everyone: does anyone know if HTML5 input="range" is considered accessible out of the box or requires ARIA?
2018-09-07T18:07:12 <jhung> lliskovoi: you mean type="range" not input "range" right?
2018-09-07T18:07:25 <lliskovoi> jhung: yes
2018-09-07T18:07:55 <jhung> lliskovoi: yes it is. Here\'s an implementation of it in the early John Travoltage prototype we did https://jhung.github.io/john-travoltage-html/
2018-09-07T18:08:36 <jhung> We added additional aria to get the end experience we desired, but it\'s accessible out of the box.
2018-09-07T18:10:14 <lliskovoi> thank jhung! The one thing I noticed for this type of input in general is that you need to use VO keys to control it (rather than arrow keys)
2018-09-07T18:12:38 <jhung> lliskovoi: I find that you need to do shift-option-down arrow in order to gain interaction using cursor keys.
