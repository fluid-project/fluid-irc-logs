2018-03-29T14:37:11 <sepidehshahi> Awesome! it\xe2\x80\x99s just a mockup, still needs more work. we will discuss it in the design crit next week, but you can send me any comments before that alanharnum
2018-03-29T14:37:29 <sepidehshahi> sure danayo,
2018-03-29T14:38:04 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: ah, if we're doing it in design crit next week, I'll just make some notes & wait for that :)
2018-03-29T14:38:20 <sepidehshahi> great, thanks alanharnum
2018-03-29T14:43:14 <danayo> sepidehshahi: is it in owncloud somewhere too?
2018-03-29T14:43:49 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99m in a meeting I\xe2\x80\x99l send you a Git link in a few minutes

2018-03-29T15:13:48 <sepidehshahi> sorry danayo  it took so long. Here is the link: https://github.com/sepidehshahi/docs-inclusive-learning/tree/restructure
2018-03-29T15:15:33 <danayo> no worries sepidehshahi! thanks. I guess I needed to look under branches to find it in Github :p
2018-03-29T15:20:35 <danayo> sepidehshahi: sorry, did you say there was a mockup? or is it all captured in the site structure file?
2018-03-29T15:22:13 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I have not made any illustrator mockups, I was using Git to prototype the new IA
2018-03-29T15:22:29 <michelled> danayo: she's implemented the changes in that branch
2018-03-29T15:25:12 <danayo> that\xe2\x80\x99s great sepidehshahi - I guess I need some help to know how to view the prototype - how do I run it/view it from Git?
2018-03-29T15:25:58 <michelled> danayo: have you ever run docpad on your machine?
2018-03-29T15:26:06 <danayo> yes
2018-03-29T15:26:07 <danayo> ok
2018-03-29T15:26:07 <sepidehshahi> thanks michelled
2018-03-29T15:26:26 <danayo> of course :)
2018-03-29T15:26:35 <danayo> I mean, of course that\xe2\x80\x99s how :)
2018-03-29T15:26:42 <michelled> danayo: you'll need to get sepidehshahi's branch onto your machine, and then run docpad in it
2018-03-29T15:26:43 <danayo> :p
2018-03-29T15:26:47 <michelled> let me know if you need help :)
2018-03-29T15:26:52 <danayo> ok michelled, thanks
2018-03-29T15:26:57 <michelled> np
2018-03-29T15:28:17 <danayo> I have to clone it, right michelled? I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably bug you after standup for help
2018-03-29T15:28:45 <michelled> let's talk after standup - you won't need to clone it if you don't want to - there are choices :)
2018-03-29T15:28:56 <danayo> I like choices michelled :)
2018-03-29T15:28:59 <danayo> thanks

2018-03-29T19:27:49 <sepidehshahi> this is interesting danayo https://www.askmeevery.com/
2018-03-29T19:29:08 <sepidehshahi> I like how open it is, the questions are sent to you as emails or text messages and there is no need to login to an app
2018-03-29T19:32:21 <danayo> oh wow sepidehshahi
2018-03-29T19:32:25 <danayo> just like our prompts!
2018-03-29T19:32:44 <sepidehshahi> exactly!!
2018-03-29T19:32:52 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer a text I think - I get so many emails!
2018-03-29T19:33:23 <sepidehshahi> ;) true
2018-03-29T19:33:53 <danayo> interesting that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need an account sepidehshahi - makes me nervous about privacy!
2018-03-29T19:34:07 <danayo> which they don\xe2\x80\x99t even mention
2018-03-29T19:35:13 <danayo> except in the fine print

2018-03-29T19:36:02 <danayo> is not reassuring
2018-03-29T19:36:28 <danayo> love those \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally accepted industry standards\xe2\x80\x9d :)
2018-03-29T19:39:33 <michelled> pretty creepy
2018-03-29T19:39:51 <sepidehshahi> this is facinating, they are collecting personal data, not gauranteeing absolute security...
