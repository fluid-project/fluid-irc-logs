b"2018-05-08T23:06:16 <carenwatkins_> Hmmm...maybe it was an internet brain cramp
2018-05-08T23:06:28 <colinclark> hard to know
2018-05-08T23:06:51 <carenwatkins_> Hope it was isolated
2018-05-08T23:07:43 <carenwatkins_> I'll open a diff browser and try pasting the link
2018-05-08T23:10:20 <carenwatkins_> Fine on safari. Maybe just my experience. Sorry for the alarm bells colinclark neuralmilkhotel
2018-05-08T23:10:31 <colinclark> no problem at all, carenwatkins_
2018-05-08T23:10:38 <colinclark> thank you so much for pointing it out, just in case
2018-05-08T23:10:54 <neuralmilkhotel> Thanks carenwatkins_
2018-05-08T23:11:03 <carenwatkins_> great project btw!

2018-05-08T21:08:17 <colinclark> neuralmilkhotel: one very minor suggestion for when you have some time...
2018-05-08T21:08:23 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Sure
2018-05-08T21:08:26 <colinclark> you should look into the settings of your editor in regards to tabs and whitespace
2018-05-08T21:08:32 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Ahhh
2018-05-08T21:08:33 <colinclark> I\'m guessing you use Atom?
2018-05-08T21:08:38 <neuralmilkhotel> I use Sublime Text
2018-05-08T21:08:41 <colinclark> ah
2018-05-08T21:08:44 <colinclark> great
2018-05-08T21:08:58 <colinclark> it\'s got settings that will let you define a consistent tabbing convention
2018-05-08T21:09:04 <neuralmilkhotel> What should I set it to?
2018-05-08T21:09:04 <colinclark> which I believe is typically four spaces in our world
2018-05-08T21:09:12 <colinclark> and to remove trailing whitespace
2018-05-08T21:09:21 * michelled joined the channel
2018-05-08T21:09:33 <neuralmilkhotel> Ahhh I had it set to "Tabs" colinclark
2018-05-08T21:09:35 <colinclark> We have lots of guidelines related to Fluid here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards
2018-05-08T21:09:50 <colinclark> and generally you\'ll find most people follow them for IDRC-related projects too
2018-05-08T21:10:36 <colinclark> and I guess we\'ve moved a lot of that sort of thing into automated linting tools that will tell you if you\'ve got something that doesn\'t follow convention
2018-05-08T21:11:11 <colinclark> I mention it only because I noticed in your PR that you\'ve got some inconsistent tab lengths and the like
2018-05-08T21:11:15 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2018-05-08T21:11:35 <simonjb> "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
2018-05-08T21:11:39 <neuralmilkhotel> Will fix that colinclark

2018-05-08T21:11:47 <neuralmilkhotel> thanks simonjb !
2018-05-08T21:11:50 <simonjb> (I\'m also a Sublime user)
2018-05-08T21:11:53 <colinclark> Do you run your HTML through some kind of a validator or linter, neuralmilkhotel?
2018-05-08T21:12:00 <colinclark> simonjb: You are?!?!
2018-05-08T21:12:22 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-05-08T21:13:04 <simonjb> colinclark: for larger JavaScript, I use WebStorm, but for general text editing, I use Sublime :)
2018-05-08T21:13:14 <colinclark> ah
2018-05-08T21:13:30 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: I use a SublimeLinter
2018-05-08T21:13:33 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf is also a big WebStorm fan
2018-05-08T21:13:35 <neuralmilkhotel> Do you have any recommendations?
2018-05-08T21:13:48 <colinclark> I usually ask Justin_o about these kinds of things
2018-05-08T21:14:12 <colinclark> I\'m not sure what we use in Infusion, but it\'s always nice to have something that can catch markup issues
2018-05-08T21:14:33 <colinclark> like your your custom <mCo-Designing /> tag :)
2018-05-08T21:14:57 <colinclark> what a great tag that will be, once browsers implement support for it
2018-05-08T21:15:04 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: Just saw that and fixed it
2018-05-08T21:16:28 <neuralmilkhotel> There should a Co-Design validator that checks if you\'ve done enough co-designing :) colinclark

2018-05-08T21:20:37 <neuralmilkhotel> Hi simonjb thanks -- replied w/ text from the license that came with it in the codepen
2018-05-08T21:20:42 <neuralmilkhotel> danayo: np
2018-05-08T21:21:30 <colinclark> neuralmilkhotel: Can you tell me where you found that license text?
2018-05-08T21:21:57 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: When you "export" the codepen it downloads a zip file and I think it comes with a predefined license text file
2018-05-08T21:22:07 <colinclark> I see
2018-05-08T21:22:20 <colinclark> Yes, all public CodePens apparently are licensed under the MIT license
2018-05-08T21:22:42 <colinclark> https://blog.codepen.io/legal/licensing/
2018-05-08T21:23:20 <gmoss> danayo: that looks great! I\'ll get cracking on that asap :)
2018-05-08T21:23:38 <danayo> gmoss: great :)
2018-05-08T21:24:14 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark: should we include that license in ours?
2018-05-08T21:24:40 <colinclark> Your comment should refer to it
2018-05-08T21:24:54 <colinclark> Ideally, I think we\'d have a separate file containing the MIT-licensed code
2018-05-08T21:25:06 <colinclark> so in your case, you\'d have created a separate CSS file for the timeline
2018-05-08T21:25:20 <colinclark> assuming that it\'s largely derived from these other peoples\' examples
2018-05-08T21:29:07 <neuralmilkhotel> Made changes simonjb and colinclark ; amended license and put timeline into its own css

2018-05-08T22:12:34 <simonjb> UIO isn\'t displaying properly on the post page
2018-05-08T22:12:44 <colinclark> oh yes, it\'s broken
2018-05-08T22:13:06 <simonjb> and in the FF web console I see an error:

2018-05-08T22:59:37 <carenwatkins_> on my computer...maybe ok on others?
2018-05-08T23:00:00 <colinclark> what do you see, carenwatkins_?
2018-05-08T23:00:26 <carenwatkins_> Very dark grey background with black type
2018-05-08T23:01:09 <colinclark> Can you email me a screenshot?
2018-05-08T23:01:14 <colinclark> Also, which browser are you using?
2018-05-08T23:01:22 <carenwatkins_> Yes...doing that now
2018-05-08T23:02:25 <neuralmilkhotel> colinclark carenwatkins_ let me know if something needs fixing on my way home
2018-05-08T23:02:26 <carenwatkins_> sent colinclark
2018-05-08T23:02:48 <carenwatkins_> Thanks neuralmilkhotel
2018-05-08T23:02:52 <colinclark> you\'re on a mac, carenwatkins_?
2018-05-08T23:02:57 <colinclark> which browser?
2018-05-08T23:03:11 <carenwatkins_> yes, I\'m on a Mac colinclark
2018-05-08T23:03:19 <carenwatkins_> Chrome
2018-05-08T23:03:22 <colinclark> are you at home or at the office?
2018-05-08T23:03:26 <carenwatkins_> home
2018-05-08T23:03:33 <colinclark> when you refresh the page, does it change?
2018-05-08T23:03:57 <colinclark> and can you check for me which version you have installed?
2018-05-08T23:04:05 <carenwatkins_> Yes it did correct when I refreshed! colinclark
2018-05-08T23:04:05 <colinclark> Chrome > About Google Chrome
2018-05-08T23:04:10 <colinclark> in your menu bar
2018-05-08T23:04:12 <colinclark> ok, that\'s interesting
2018-05-08T23:04:28 <colinclark> i wonder if your network connection died midway through loading the CSS or something?
2018-05-08T23:04:56 <carenwatkins_> hmmm...I linked through the twitter link a few times to see if it would be different and it wasn\'t
2018-05-08T23:05:16 <carenwatkins_> Let me try again
2018-05-08T23:05:45 <carenwatkins_> so now it is rendering fine...perhaps because I refreshed already colinclark
2018-05-08T23:05:54 <colinclark> very odd

2018-05-08T15:44:54 <gmoss> Justin_o: yes the content in the middle section of the page (with the white background) will grow with the content that\'s in it (i.e. more blocks = taller middle section), but as we mentioned in the crit, the footer is not fixed to the bottom of screen, it\'s in flow with the rest of the elements and is just at the bottom of that. Any excess space is just going to be the page body which happens to have the same background
2018-05-08T15:44:54 <gmoss> colour as the footer

2018-05-08T16:43:04 <danayo> michelled, alanharnum, gregor, neuralmilkhotel, simonjb and everyone: think this is an improvement on the splash page and also navigation thanks to your feedback: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/QQPqR4DTdorqTYa
2018-05-08T16:43:16 <danayo> not sure that we have time to implement the tabs/nav
2018-05-08T16:43:30 <danayo> can we meet in about an hour or later this aft to discuss?
2018-05-08T16:43:45 <danayo> also: CAN WE MAKE THE LITTLE BIRD JUMP TO NAV? :D
2018-05-08T16:44:40 <danayo> also: not sure about the word "Descriptors" but so far can\'t think of anything better other than Title/Author/Keywords
2018-05-08T16:48:55 <danayo> michelled, alanharnum, gregor specifically - I meant meet to discuss what\'s feasible in time for our trip
2018-05-08T16:54:12 <danayo> Justin_o too - nav in the top bar works nicely I think ^

2018-05-08T18:03:42 <gmoss> danayo: Just saw this since the tag was my regular name instead of my username, sorry! I like it a lot, it combines the welcoming whimsy of the waving person and gives the user the option of what the first step is. I love the idea of having the little bird jump to nav! implementation may have to wait until after the sprint but we\'ll see hahaha
2018-05-08T18:03:53 <gmoss> I\'m available to discuss whenever everyone else is
2018-05-08T18:04:51 <danayo> thanks gmoss gregor
2018-05-08T18:04:56 <danayo> sorry about that
2018-05-08T18:05:14 <gmoss> no worries :)
2018-05-08T18:05:25 <gmoss> I\'m trying to think of a word that might fit better than "descriptors"

2018-05-08T18:12:05 <michelled> danayo, alanharnum, gmoss: when is good to meet?
2018-05-08T18:12:32 <alanharnum> michelled danayo gmoss: 3:00?
2018-05-08T18:12:43 <danayo> 3 works for me
2018-05-08T18:12:48 <michelled> sounds good
2018-05-08T18:13:16 <gmoss> michelled alanharnum danayo 3:00 is good for me!
2018-05-08T18:16:14 <neuralmilkhotel> danayo: I am wondering if the image "El planeta es la escuela" used in the header in the 2nd page could be used in the starting screen too, as the main header/logo
2018-05-08T18:17:09 <danayo> it could neuralmilkhotel, I tried it at one point and found it got a bit busy with imagery - there\xe2\x80\x99s something about that figure on its own that I really like
2018-05-08T18:18:07 <neuralmilkhotel> I really love the illustrations :) I\'d want to use them all too
2018-05-08T18:19:29 <danayo> seriously neuralmilkhotel it was hard not to try to cram them all in
2018-05-08T18:19:43 <neuralmilkhotel> I completely understand :) danayo

2018-05-08T20:46:08 <colinclark> thank you very much, i appreciate it
2018-05-08T20:46:48 <simonjb> neuralmilkhotel: let me know when you\'re ready :)

2018-05-08T20:54:18 <colinclark> I filed https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/CITY/issues/CITY-6 for this post in JIRA
2018-05-08T20:54:20 <colinclark> in case it helps
2018-05-08T20:54:43 <colinclark> CITY-2 is somewhat inscrutable to me :)
2018-05-08T20:55:39 <neuralmilkhotel> Sorry about that colinclark I made the branch before making the JIRA
2018-05-08T20:56:10 <colinclark> no problem
2018-05-08T20:56:17 <simonjb> neuralmilkhotel: could we change the PR to CITY-6 though?
2018-05-08T20:56:28 <neuralmilkhotel> Sure simonjb
2018-05-08T20:56:36 <simonjb> and would you mind merging in the latest master?
2018-05-08T20:56:40 <colinclark> it\'s just funny to have a pull request that introduces a second page, related to a JIRA ticket that mentions a "one-pager"

2018-05-08T21:00:59 <danayo> gmoss: here is the mockup for story editing without any changes to the current version/nav of the tool https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/HuoRZjHnj0DiJoW
2018-05-08T21:01:06 <danayo> I\'ll mockup story browsing now
2018-05-08T21:01:41 <danayo> and prepare the assets
