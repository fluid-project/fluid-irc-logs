2018-09-24T19:29:11 <danayo> colinclark, michelled, I started this spreadsheet to keep track of the email responses to the co-design callout. Based on the responses I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely clear that we want participation from potential users of the site (rather than from those with experience building websites etc). Though of course they can be one and the same. Wonder if the callout needs a bit of re-wording

2018-09-24T19:39:49 <michelled> danayo: I think the call out is pretty clear that we want users of the site
2018-09-24T19:40:13 <michelled> it's possible that it's just that website builders feel more comfortable offering opinions
2018-09-24T19:40:41 <danayo> yeah, I thought it was pretty clear too michelled, thanks
2018-09-24T19:40:50 <colinclark> yup
2018-09-24T19:41:05 <colinclark> and there are probably a few in here looking for gigs, too
2018-09-24T19:41:11 <colinclark> which is understandable
2018-09-24T19:41:14 <danayo> for sure colinclark
