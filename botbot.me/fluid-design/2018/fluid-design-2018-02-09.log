b'2018-02-09T21:05:59 <grrrero> carenwatkins: Yep very easily done
2018-02-09T21:06:35 <carenwatkins> awesome. I think it is more readable\xe2\x80\xa6have a quick look using the UIO.
2018-02-09T21:07:04 <jhung> carenwatkins: is it okay if it\'s Arial on Windows or should it be Roboto?
2018-02-09T21:07:06 <carenwatkins> It helps that Matthew Carter designed it!
2018-02-09T21:07:39 <jhung> Actually\xe2\x80\xa6. does Verdana come on Windows now?
2018-02-09T21:07:47 <carenwatkins> I still think Arial is a better choice than Roboto.
2018-02-09T21:07:51 <grrrero> I thought it always did jhung ?
2018-02-09T21:08:01 <carenwatkins> Oh, that would be perfect if it did !
2018-02-09T21:08:45 <jhung> lol grrrero you\'re right.
2018-02-09T21:08:47 <jhung> https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=1
2018-02-09T21:09:00 <jhung> According to that link, it\'s been there since 1996. :D
2018-02-09T21:09:03 <grrrero> jhung: I just committed changes; removed box-shadow, removed unnecessary !importants
2018-02-09T21:09:05 <carenwatkins> awesome :-)
2018-02-09T21:09:13 <grrrero> Hahahahhaa 1996 jhung carenwatkins
2018-02-09T21:09:26 <grrrero> I didn\'t even think that far back
2018-02-09T21:09:28 <jhung> grrrero: nice thanks. I\'ll update on my end.
2018-02-09T21:09:33 <grrrero> Ok cool thanks jhung
2018-02-09T21:09:47 <grrrero> I also started removing elements from the parent theme that are dups
2018-02-09T21:10:11 <grrrero> I might continue that work in another branch since this PR is mostly for the sidebars/post/pages
2018-02-09T21:10:29 <jhung> grrrero: ok.
2018-02-09T21:10:53 <jhung> But I might end up making comments on stuff that are duplicates. :)
2018-02-09T21:11:09 <grrrero> jhung: No worries, do it :D So I can make sure they\'re gone
2018-02-09T21:11:29 <grrrero> Or if you want me to keep editing now and just include it in this PR?
2018-02-09T21:11:36 <grrrero> I could do either way
2018-02-09T21:11:42 <grrrero> Whichever is easiest for you :)
2018-02-09T21:12:17 <jhung> grrrero: I\'m fine either way as long and you can keep track of it all in your head. :D
2018-02-09T21:12:23 <carenwatkins> jhung: grrrero : re the UIO I noticed that when Times is chosen the font Georgia is applied to the site. (But I think Georgia might be a better web font choice than Times)\x08
2018-02-09T21:12:52 <grrrero> jhung: @_@
2018-02-09T21:13:04 <grrrero> carenwatkins: Georgia is the default "serif" font
2018-02-09T21:13:10 <grrrero> Used in UIO
2018-02-09T21:13:20 <jhung> carenwatkins: that would be a UIO thing. Best to email jus\ttin_o or cindyli about that one.
2018-02-09T21:13:48 <carenwatkins> ok, thanks jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them know.
2018-02-09T21:17:19 <grrrero> lol jhung I have a "z-index: 10; // fix this" comment HAHA pls disregard while I go and actually fix it
2018-02-09T21:17:43 <jhung> grrrero: I\'ll pretend I didn\'t see it
2018-02-09T21:17:51 <grrrero> Thanks ;)

2018-02-09T16:45:10 <jhung1> Oh Justin_o
2018-02-09T16:45:43 <jhung1> I just thought of another word which has different syllable structure depending on the person / context.
2018-02-09T16:45:57 <Justin_o> oh what\'s taht
2018-02-09T16:46:05 <jhung1> "Etcetera"
2018-02-09T16:46:37 <Justin_o> jhung: how would you break that up
2018-02-09T16:47:12 <jhung> Some people make the last \'e\' silent, so it reads with 3 syllables instead of 4.
2018-02-09T16:47:41 <jhung> I do both interchangeably, but the 3 syllable I use more casually.
2018-02-09T16:48:22 <jhung> I use the 4 syllable when I\'m wearing my top-hat and monocle.
2018-02-09T16:48:57 <Justin_o> haha.. ah you\'re right..
2018-02-09T16:50:35 <michelled> jhung: you should wear your monocle to work more often
2018-02-09T16:51:29 <Justin_o> are we starting Monocle Mondays?

2018-02-09T17:06:11 <sepidehshahi> michelled: Justin_o or jhung have you ever added content to the DSpace? Alan always helped me to do so and now I can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to add a new page there.
2018-02-09T17:09:01 <michelled> no, I just ask alan every time sepidehshahi

2018-02-09T17:17:37 <jhung> I can see if I can help. I need to sign up for an account first sepidehshahi (I used to have access, but it seems to be gone).
2018-02-09T17:20:57 <sepidehshahi> thanks jhung, I have signed up for an account. So, if you find out how, please let me know and I can upload the content myself. The problem is that it does not send me the verification email after creating the account
2018-02-09T17:21:59 <jhung> The new user form says the password must be 6 characters, but in reality it must be 8 characters.
2018-02-09T17:23:06 <jhung> sepidehshahi: my confirmation email went into my Spam folder.
2018-02-09T17:23:24 <sepidehshahi> oh ok, let me check that
2018-02-09T17:24:04 <sepidehshahi> yes! it was in my junk folder
2018-02-09T17:25:03 <jhung> sepidehshahi: once you log in, there should be a "Add content" link in the top-right corner next to "Log out"
2018-02-09T17:26:18 <sepidehshahi> perfect jhung! before veryfying my email I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that. It should be easy after this, thanks a lot!

2018-02-09T18:40:43 <sepidehshahi> Do you know if this means the page is created and temporarily unavailable? sorry I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who to ask these questions from so I bug you with them :)
2018-02-09T18:42:01 <jhung> sepidehshahi: Good question! I suspect it needs to get moderated / checked. So you don\'t have access at the moment? I\'m just assuming.
2018-02-09T18:42:20 <sepidehshahi> ok, thanks
2018-02-09T18:43:26 <jhung> Maybe alanharnum can check when he\'s around next to see where it is.
2018-02-09T18:43:48 <sepidehshahi> good Idea!

2018-02-09T20:11:48 <grrrero> So jhung I\'m playing around with the box-shadowing
2018-02-09T20:12:15 <grrrero> What I\'m doing is applying multiple box-shadows on the top, right, bottom to cover all the leftover whitespace
2018-02-09T20:12:25 <grrrero> `ox-shadow: 0.4rem -1rem 1rem -0.3rem #c0c0c0, 0.4rem 0rem 1rem -0.3rem #c0c0c0, 0.4rem 1rem 1rem -0.3rem #c0c0c0;`
2018-02-09T20:12:28 <grrrero> Oops
2018-02-09T20:12:32 <grrrero> `box-shadow: 0.4rem -1rem 1rem -0.3rem #c0c0c0, 0.4rem 0rem 1rem -0.3rem #c0c0c0, 0.4rem 1rem 1rem -0.3rem #c0c0c0;`
2018-02-09T20:13:20 <grrrero> As an example
2018-02-09T20:15:41 <grrrero> Looks more like this now
2018-02-09T20:15:49 <grrrero> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/6nN811Bk/Screen%20Shot%202018-02-09%20at%2015.15.28.png
2018-02-09T20:16:23 <grrrero> Now a bit too much shadow overlapping on the right side but will keep tweaking
2018-02-09T20:16:37 <grrrero> Sorry should just put this in the JIRA haha
2018-02-09T20:19:38 <jhung> grrrero: wow. That seems like a lot just to address this issue. If we decide to keep it, we\'d have to document exactly what\'s being done, otherwise it\'ll be hard to maintain in the future.
2018-02-09T20:19:46 * carenwatkins joined the channel
2018-02-09T20:20:04 <jhung> I\'m in favour of keeping it simple.
2018-02-09T20:20:22 <grrrero> jhung: So should I just keep one box-shadow instead of using multiple?
2018-02-09T20:22:37 <jhung> grrrero: What happens if you put background-color: #fff; on .a11y-main-nav ?
2018-02-09T20:22:47 <jhung> And use just 1 box shadow?
2018-02-09T20:24:25 <grrrero> Looks the same as before the multiple box shadows
2018-02-09T20:24:29 <grrrero> ^ jhung
2018-02-09T20:24:49 <carenwatkins> sorry to jump in jhung and grrrero : I just came on the channel and saw your convo. Would you consider no shadow? Or am I way off what your conversation is about. :-)
2018-02-09T20:26:23 <jhung> grrrero, carenwatkins: That was going to be my next suggestion. Why not get rid of the box shadow and use a border on the sidebar instead?
2018-02-09T20:26:44 <grrrero> I\'m good with that! jhung carenwatkins
2018-02-09T20:27:21 <grrrero> Or! an inset box shadow?
2018-02-09T20:27:22 <grrrero> ?_?
2018-02-09T20:27:32 <jhung> Just a light grey on the right border should work grrrero.
2018-02-09T20:27:40 <grrrero> Ok sure jhung carenwatkins
2018-02-09T20:27:43 <carenwatkins> does it need something more than the swath of colour?
2018-02-09T20:28:49 <grrrero> Not sure what you mean carenwatkins
2018-02-09T20:29:31 <carenwatkins> no border, no shadow\xe2\x80\x94just a bar of colour?
2018-02-09T20:29:39 <carenwatkins> grrrero: ^
2018-02-09T20:29:49 <grrrero> carenwatkins: I\'m good with that too

2018-02-09T20:30:50 <grrrero> I actually like it better this way
2018-02-09T20:30:56 <grrrero> So if you\'re good with that carenwatkins and jhung
2018-02-09T20:31:09 <grrrero> Also simplifies things :)

2018-02-09T20:31:29 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99m good with that. What do you think jhung ?
2018-02-09T20:31:46 <jhung> carenwatkins: Yep sounds fine with me.

2018-02-09T20:38:08 <carenwatkins> I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to have missed PhET today. I sent Emily an email.
2018-02-09T20:38:44 <jhung> glad you\'re feeling better. I missed the PhET meeting as well but I did send Emily an email telling her we both weren\'t going to be there carenwatkins.
2018-02-09T20:39:20 <carenwatkins> thanks jhung \xe2\x80\xa6 next week HEAT MAPPING :-)
2018-02-09T20:41:17 <jhung> carenwatkins: sounds good! I was wondering if we can collaborate on that?
2018-02-09T20:42:20 <carenwatkins> that would be great jhung . I think it makes sense to align our paths on this now.
2018-02-09T20:44:45 <jhung> also carenwatkins, I\'ve been adding to the CaT wiki page. I\'m trying to bring it to a practical level to help people conduct their own CaT and explain our thought process into our own CaT (which we\'ve documented already on the wiki, thankfully).
2018-02-09T20:47:10 <carenwatkins> that sounds good, jhung. Practical and applicable is important :-)
