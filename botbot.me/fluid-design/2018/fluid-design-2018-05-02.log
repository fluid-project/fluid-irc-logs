2018-05-02T15:18:42 <lliskovoi> alanharnum, gmoss (and anyone else who has worked with multi-language content): what would you recommend for programmatically defining language in a plugin that allows people to comment on webpages? I\'m thinking comments may be in different languages so wondering if you have any thoughts on how to best identify them so the content is properly read out by ATs.
2018-05-02T15:19:59 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: the big thing, I believe, is to make sure that markup has the proper attributes for the language of the content
2018-05-02T15:20:27 <alanharnum> the LANG attribute is the key to this - global attribute, described at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang
2018-05-02T15:20:57 <alanharnum> Leonie Watson from Paciello has a good summary here: https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2016/06/using-the-html-lang-attribute/
2018-05-02T15:22:01 <alanharnum> in terms of your specific question, what do you mean by "programatically defining language"?
2018-05-02T15:22:48 <sepidehshahi> Hi gtirloni, we are wondering if you could help us setup a mailing list for the inclusive cities site that neuralmilkhotel is working on
2018-05-02T15:23:17 <alanharnum> FE, does that mean something like "users should be able to enter a comment in the language of their choice, without having to specify the language, and the application figures it out and adds appropriate metadata when storing the content"?
2018-05-02T15:23:47 <gtirloni> sepidehshahi: hi, sure, what name would you like?
2018-05-02T15:23:59 <lliskovoi> thanks alanharnum, the lang attribute is exactly what I was talking about. I\'m assuming that generally it\'s inheriting the page lang attribute, but wondering what happens if let\'s say one person comments in French when the rest of the content is in English. I\'m familiar with the lang attribute for sections of text when they are different from the page language for static content. But it gets more complicat
2018-05-02T15:23:59 <lliskovoi> user generated content. Would you have to ask the user to define the language in that case?
2018-05-02T15:24:34 <lliskovoi> alanharnum: exactly! ^ is there a way of injecting the lang attribute without having the user define it?
2018-05-02T15:25:12 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: I believe that while accurate machine translation is not a solved problem, simply being able to detect the language of a chunk of text (provided it\'s more than just a single word) is not too bad
2018-05-02T15:26:18 <lliskovoi> ok, so in theory they should be able to identify the language automatically?
2018-05-02T15:26:20 <alanharnum> so you\'d need a library that would recognize text entered in a language and append the appropriate language metadata to whatever storage mechanism you\'re using for the content
2018-05-02T15:26:31 <lliskovoi> do you have any resources on how that\'s done?
2018-05-02T15:27:31 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-05-02T15:27:48 <alanharnum> "in theory" - generally like speech recognition, language recognition is based on confidence scores - a library like https://github.com/wooorm/franc should offer some guidance
2018-05-02T15:28:08 <lliskovoi> great, I\'ll have a look, thanks alanharnum!
2018-05-02T15:28:18 <alanharnum> this could also be done on the fly when a comment is written out or similar
2018-05-02T15:29:12 <alanharnum> I can think of a number of different approaches, but the main thing (from an "AT interprets text correctly" POV, like a screenreader reads a comment in French using French pronunciation, etc) is making sure each block of text has the appropriate LANG attribute
2018-05-02T15:30:02 <alanharnum> you could do things like a combination of detecting the user\'s preferred browser language + language recognition - it likely wouldn\'t be perfect but it might be "good enough"
2018-05-02T15:31:55 <alanharnum> lliskovoi: the demo page for franc at http://wooorm.com/franc/ may be helpful for understanding how the tech works - you can see it gives a probability table below for the sentence, it will give you a different language when you reload

2018-05-02T15:59:45 <sepidehshahi> Hi jessm: when would be a good time for you to talk to me and danayo about the mapping tool?

2018-05-02T16:41:31 <danayo> sepidehshahi: sounds like jessm will be back by 1:00. Can we aim to meet at 1:30?
2018-05-02T16:42:45 <sepidehshahi> I may need to prepare some material before the meeting, so hopefully that would give me enough time danayo
2018-05-02T16:43:11 <danayo> sepidehshahi: do you want to meet now?
2018-05-02T16:43:15 <danayo> then we can meet with jessm later?
2018-05-02T16:44:01 <sepidehshahi> no worries, we can wait till 1:30, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will take more than 30 min to prepare the facets
2018-05-02T16:44:27 <danayo> ok
