2018-04-09T17:43:02 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: can anyone suggest a name for our upcoming self voicing component. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6175
2018-04-09T17:43:19 <Justin_o> most of our names are nouns, like reorderer, tableOfContents, uploader, etc.
2018-04-09T17:45:37 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-04-09T17:46:04 <grrrero> Speak Out Loud? Justin_o
2018-04-09T17:46:08 <grrrero> ?_?
2018-04-09T17:46:30 <jhung> Justin_o: Totally not great, but maybe fodder for better names\xe2\x80\xa6 how about "textVoicer" ? It gives an idea of what it works on (text), as well as it\'s ability (text to speech).
2018-04-09T17:46:57 <jhung> or "PageVoicer"
2018-04-09T17:47:14 <Justin_o> grrrero, jhung: thanks.. so some other background info is that there is a separate component called textToSpeech
2018-04-09T17:47:20 <Justin_o> which is sort of the underlying engine
2018-04-09T17:47:48 <jhung> "pageToSpeech"?
2018-04-09T17:48:50 <simonjb> pageReader
2018-04-09T17:50:42 <simonjb> pageSpeaker
2018-04-09T17:51:17 <jhung> simonjb: I was thinking that too, but I was wondering if "Reader" was too ambiguous / not specific enough. It\'s a much friendlier name though.
2018-04-09T17:51:35 <grrrero> +1 for pageReader simonjb Justin_o jhung
2018-04-09T17:53:08 * avtar joined the channel
2018-04-09T17:55:09 <clown> IBM one had a product, called "Home Page Reader", which was a web browser for the blind:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Home_Page_Reader
2018-04-09T17:55:17 <clown> *once had a product...
2018-04-09T17:59:46 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-04-09T18:03:45 <simonjb> clown: ah yes, I\'d forgotten about Home Page Reader!
2018-04-09T18:04:37 <clown> yes, simonjb, even earlier there was "pwWebSpeak".  (no wikipedia entry for that)
2018-04-09T18:05:53 <clown> (the "pw" stood for the company, "Productivity Works")
2018-04-09T18:08:07 <danayo> I like pageReader Justin_o, simonjb, jhung, grrrero, clown
2018-04-09T18:13:47 <simonjb> clown: it\'s funny looking at the hardware requirements for Home Page Reader: 166 Mhz processor and 64 MB of RAM for the Windows NT version -- I guess Windows NT really did used to run with only 64 MB of RAM!
2018-04-09T18:18:01 <simonjb> it seems that recently the change in computer specs has slowed down, with RAM prices even going up, that I forget sometimes just how quickly they used to change
2018-04-09T18:18:47 <clown> Justin_o, simonjb, jhung, grrrero, danayo, I found a copy of a description of what Home Page Reader did.  Interesting read \xe2\x80\x94 in addition to speech, it provided a means for changning font size and colours, magnifying, and even "\xe2\x80\xa6highlighting words and characters as they are spoken\xe2\x80\xa6".  Ahead of its time?  https://web.archive.org/web/20100729142234/http://www.spectronicsinoz.com/product/home-page-reader-version-3
2018-04-09T18:19:49 <gmoss> Justin_o: thinking of tea-related names, not sure if this is "worthy" as it\'s a component and not a whole codebase as such. The one that came to mind was "mouthfeel", but maybe this is too weird. if we\'re going for a more descriptive name, I\'d suggest something like "narrator"
2018-04-09T18:20:20 <clown> gmoss, "narrator" is what MS calls its built in screen reader.  Likely too close.
2018-04-09T18:20:32 <gmoss> clown: dang, well it was worth a shot haha
2018-04-09T18:21:30 <gmoss> things you could name something after: what it does, what it\'s similar to, what it\'s made of, what it reminds you of
2018-04-09T18:21:57 <gmoss> in the case of narrator, a role/person that performs the same task
2018-04-09T18:22:08 <clown> "oracle"  sigh, that\'s the name of a big company.
2018-04-09T18:22:12 <gmoss> hah
2018-04-09T18:23:11 <clown> "voice-over"?
2018-04-09T18:24:00 <gmoss> would it be off-base to call it "screenReader"?
2018-04-09T18:24:40 <clown> maybe since there is/was a tendancy to contrast "self-voicing" with "screen reading"
2018-04-09T18:25:46 <gmoss> clown: I was not aware, but now I am!
2018-04-09T18:27:13 <simonjb> "self-voicing" generally means an individual application and "screen reading" tends to mean a system-wide tool that works across applications
2018-04-09T18:28:09 <simonjb> for a suitable definition of "application" and "system-wide" :)
2018-04-09T18:28:12 <clown> also, a screen reader is an "agent" that is intermediate between the user and the thing being read.  "self-voicing" can mean that the thing itself does the reading.
2018-04-09T18:29:29 <gmoss> clown simonjb: thank you :)
2018-04-09T18:29:59 <gmoss> auracle? :P
2018-04-09T18:30:41 <grrrero> I was going to suggest "vox" but it is used in so many applications
2018-04-09T18:30:51 <grrrero> And a news website :P
2018-04-09T18:31:37 <gmoss> vox ex machina haha
2018-04-09T18:31:44 <grrrero> Haha!! Like that one, gmoss
2018-04-09T18:32:03 * alanharnum joined the channel
