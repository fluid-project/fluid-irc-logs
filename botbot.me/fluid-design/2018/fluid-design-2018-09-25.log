2018-09-25T14:15:36 <jhung1> danayo: for DEEP, do you want to collaborate on the CMHR talk? I think the keypad dovetails nicely to my involvement with the CMHR IAD Guide.
2018-09-25T14:15:41 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2018-09-25T14:16:14 <danayo> jhung: that sounds great
2018-09-25T14:17:18 <danayo> and makes so much sense - since we had so many discussions with them about semantic structure and relation to the keypad
2018-09-25T14:29:19 <jhung> yeah. Maybe we can start talking about how the keypad was created, then I can segue into my trip to the museum and seeing the keypad and inclusive exhibits there.
2018-09-25T14:29:23 <jhung> ^danayo
2018-09-25T14:31:36 <danayo> sounds good jhung
2018-09-25T14:40:32 <gmoss> jhung: have you seen Cybele\'s question in the vidyo chat? I\'m not sure how to respond. do you think there will be time later on in this call to discuss the 12th or was this just to be the 13th?

2018-09-25T16:56:55 <clown> carenwatkins_:  did it work for you?  I can\'t get the applet to run.
2018-09-25T16:59:54 <carenwatkins_> no didn\'t get it to work clown but knowing about this work is awesome (I\'m relativly new so will be learning about a lot of what you guys have done over the years) Word prediction is so so helpful in the learning enviro and is a crucial inclusive tool!
2018-09-25T17:02:55 <carenwatkins_> ...and the clown on your page!! You should get a button made with that and wear it a the open house :-)
2018-09-25T17:03:43 <clown> carenwatkins_:  at the time, word prediction tools were available for PCs (and maybe Macs) but somone at Sun contacted us and said "how\'s about showing a demo of word prediction using Java?)

2018-09-25T17:07:29 <carenwatkins_> Very cool...as in SUN technologies ?

2018-09-25T17:08:58 <clown> carenwatkins_:   Sun Microsytems \xe2\x80\x94 the company that created Java.  Bought out by Oracle a few years ago.  Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems
2018-09-25T17:09:05 <clown> one of the best logos ever...
2018-09-25T17:10:31 <carenwatkins_> ah, neat. Agree, great logo clown
2018-09-25T17:11:13 <carenwatkins_> Great "story" clown :-)

2018-09-25T18:05:15 <Justin_o> actually i hadn\'t realized that npm includes those metrics too, it\'s just harder to notice and doesn\'t have the score applied https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=infusion
