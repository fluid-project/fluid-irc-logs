2018-03-09T15:34:35 <jhung> fluid-everyone: something cool today! The new $10 bill features Viola Desmond on one side, and the CMHR on the opposite side: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/cmhr-10-dollar-bill-1.4567809
2018-03-09T15:36:38 <Justin_o> I hadn\'t heard about the CMHR being on it before
2018-03-09T15:37:05 <jhung> Here\'s a complimentary article which focuses more on Viola Desmond http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/viola-desmond-10-unveiled-1.4567290

2018-03-09T20:23:39 <danayo> hi jhung, I was hoping to add the new collaborative art activity to the guide but when I try to clone my fork it\xe2\x80\x99s telling me I don\xe2\x80\x99t have permission - I wonder if you have a few minutes to help me?
2018-03-09T20:24:26 <jhung> danayo: Currently in a meeting. It should be wrapping up in the next 10 minutes. I can help you then?
2018-03-09T20:24:35 <danayo> sure, thanks jhung
2018-03-09T20:24:58 <jhung> which repository are you trying to clone?
2018-03-09T20:25:02 <jhung> ^danayo
2018-03-09T20:26:40 <danayo> jhung, I was trying to clone my fork of this repo https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca
2018-03-09T20:26:52 <danayo> here https://github.com/dayotte/docs-guidelines
2018-03-09T20:28:24 <jhung> I assume you tried "git clone https://github.com/dayotte/docs-guidelines"?
2018-03-09T20:29:49 <danayo> oops jhung I did this instead: git clone git@github.com:dayotte/docs-guidelines.git
2018-03-09T20:30:03 <danayo> I\xe2\x80\x9dm having deja vu
2018-03-09T20:30:12 <danayo> it worked when I did it the way you suggested :p
2018-03-09T20:30:21 <jhung> Awesome\t danayo!
2018-03-09T20:30:26 <danayo> :D thanks jhung
2018-03-09T20:30:33 <jhung> No prob! :)
2018-03-09T20:36:47 <danayo> jhung one more question - do I need to update my fork first somehow? I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming I should see all the latest content in my local folder (I don\xe2\x80\x99t right now)

2018-03-09T20:49:06 <jhung> danayo: yes you will likely need to update your fork.
2018-03-09T20:49:53 <jhung> danayo: to do that you must first add the original repository as the "upstream". Do "git remote add upstream https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca"
2018-03-09T20:50:08 <jhung> then "git fetch upstream"
2018-03-09T20:50:37 <danayo> thanks jhung - and I do that from the master branch, right?
2018-03-09T20:50:44 <jhung> then "git merge upstream/foo" where foo is the branch name. Probably "master" in your case.
2018-03-09T20:51:19 <jhung> danayo: yeah, in master
2018-03-09T20:52:05 <jhung> danayo: we can walk through on Vidyo too if you prefer that.
2018-03-09T20:57:46 <danayo> thanks jhung, just trying it now - will ping you if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work!
2018-03-09T20:58:42 <jhung> ok
2018-03-09T21:01:54 <danayo> jhung - followed all the steps, but my local content still seems to be out of date :(
2018-03-09T21:02:28 <jhung> ok. Want to Vidyo danayo?
2018-03-09T21:02:51 <danayo> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99m in my room
