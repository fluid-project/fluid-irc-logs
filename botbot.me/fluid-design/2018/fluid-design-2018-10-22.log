2018-10-22T19:43:09 <michelled> colinclark, danayo: can one of you take a look at this list and let me know what you think? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Labour+Platform+Features
2018-10-22T19:43:34 <michelled> I tried to keep it high level but still cover everything
2018-10-22T19:43:45 <michelled> but you can imagine there are a lot of details hiding under each point
2018-10-22T19:47:26 <danayo> thanks michelled it looks good. One thing we may want to add is some kind of metrics gathering - I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of the metrics that Cataki said they wanted to collect
2018-10-22T19:47:49 <colinclark> I\'m puzzled
2018-10-22T19:48:02 <colinclark> I thought we were building a governance tool and a scheduling tool
2018-10-22T19:48:23 <colinclark> Do we need all these features for those two?
2018-10-22T19:48:54 <colinclark> or is this something that charts all the stuff that\'s out of scope for this particular project, but that will be needed for a full-featured labour platform?
2018-10-22T19:49:38 <michelled> my reading of his message was charting all the stuff that\'s out of scope. but honestly, a lot depends on what a \'scheduling tool\' is
2018-10-22T19:50:07 * cindyli has quit
2018-10-22T19:50:08 <michelled> I started to map what I thought it was on Friday - it\'s on my desk - and I very quickly had lots of these features in it - such as mapping
2018-10-22T19:51:26 <colinclark> ok
2018-10-22T19:52:07 <michelled> maybe I should make separate lists on this page \'governance tool\' \'scheduling tool\' and \'labour platform\'
2018-10-22T19:58:57 <colinclark> I think so
2018-10-22T20:00:26 <danayo> that sounds good to me too michelled
2018-10-22T20:08:47 <colinclark> I think it\'s really important, especially in regards to Trebor, to be clear about what we think needs to (and can) be built for this grant, and what is necessary but not yet possible
2018-10-22T20:13:20 <michelled> yes, I agree!
2018-10-22T20:13:56 <michelled> danayo, colinclark: I updated the list, this time taking a very simplistic view on scheduling and leaving the complexity in the labour platform list
2018-10-22T20:13:58 <michelled> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Labour+Platform+Features
2018-10-22T20:14:44 <michelled> I guess I should add more to the labour platform with the things that corise wanted
2018-10-22T20:14:54 <michelled> or I could pull some of that out into another grouping

2018-10-22T21:06:13 <colinclark> michelled: My impression is that we should try to flesh out the functionality of the two key tools a bit more.
2018-10-22T21:06:23 <colinclark> I know your goal was to be high level, which is great
2018-10-22T21:06:31 <colinclark> so now maybe the next step is to start to break those things down a bit
2018-10-22T21:07:02 <colinclark> and possibly to think if it\'s possible to describe what kinds of goverance situations (what kinds of decision-making?) can be supported, and which ones won\'t yet
2018-10-22T21:07:25 <colinclark> or another way to approach is it to ask, "What can something like Loomio do already, and what we will have to do with it?"
2018-10-22T21:42:57 <michelled> sounds good colinclark - I\'ll work on that tomorrow
2018-10-22T21:43:02 <colinclark> cool
2018-10-22T21:43:08 <colinclark> i like what you\'ve got\xe2\x80\x94it all made sense
2018-10-22T21:44:46 <michelled> thx
