2015-05-21T14:22:12 <murilocrivellari> Hi, danaayotte. I'm ready to show you my ideas when you have the time
2015-05-21T14:27:21 <danaayotte> great murilocrivellari. anastasiac would you like to join us to discuss?
2015-05-21T14:27:41 <anastasiac> yes, indeed
2015-05-21T14:27:55 <anastasiac> let me get my headset...
2015-05-21T14:28:34 <danaayotte> great. let's use vidyo. my room.
2015-05-21T14:29:06 <murilocrivellari> danaayotte, anastasiac I actually don't have a vidyo account...
2015-05-21T14:29:16 <danaayotte> yes I just realised that
2015-05-21T14:29:43 <anastasiac> murilocrivellari, you should probably have one :-)
2015-05-21T14:29:53 <danaayotte> yes we'll have to get you set up
2015-05-21T14:30:03 <anastasiac> let me look into what\xe2\x80\x99s involved
2015-05-21T14:30:37 <danaayotte> thanks anastasiac
2015-05-21T14:35:05 <danaayotte> murilocrivellari: in the meantime could you save your work in dropbox and send a link?
2015-05-21T14:36:33 <murilocrivellari> sure, will do
2015-05-21T14:41:42 <murilocrivellari> danaayotte, anastasiac https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fdj9r0ynsjr391z/AAATqUFSkNMm2N3F3jPevQk6a?dl=0
2015-05-21T14:45:49 <anastasiac> danaayotte: you should be able to use the \xe2\x80\x98email icon\xe2\x80\x99 to create an URL that you can email to murilocrivellari, to invite him to your Vidyo room. He should be able to use that URL to join without an account
2015-05-21T14:46:11 <danaayotte> cool. ok. i will try
2015-05-21T14:46:11 <Jess__> danaayotte: anastasiac: ping me if you need help doing this

2015-05-21T16:08:54 <anastasiac> murilocrivellari, we talked about sharing your sign language designs with the broader PGA team. That discussion will happen on the PGA mailing list, so you should probably join that list
2015-05-21T16:08:59 <anastasiac> you can sign up here: http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/globalpreferences
2015-05-21T16:10:19 <murilocrivellari> thanks, anastasiac. I'll join it right now

2015-05-21T19:23:20 <danaayotte> hi fluid-everyone, sepideh and I had a quick and interesting Skype exchange yesterday after the P4A meeting and I reliased it would be good to have it in the channel. so I thought I'd try copying it here
2015-05-21T19:23:49 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:09:46 AM] sepideh shahi: Hi Dana, thanks for the comments about persona and the questions. I will update them based on your point today.
2015-05-21T19:23:50 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:12:49 AM] Dana Ayotte: you're welcome. i had just noticed that a lot of our focus seems to be on developers, I guess because of the developer space work, but my understanding of the platform is that it will serve a much broader group of users
2015-05-21T19:23:52 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:15:27 AM] sepideh shahi: You are absolutely right. There are two problems that have caused this I guess, one is the DOW focus on the developer\xe2\x80\x99s space and the other is that we are surrounded by developers so they are the most accessible people to talk with. We hardly get a chance to talk to people like Maria. So, I think I have to step out of this space and see who else can build and produce rather than just
2015-05-21T19:23:53 <danaayotte> developers. I may need to attend or connect with someone at Tetra
2015-05-21T19:23:54 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:20:09 AM] Dana Ayotte: that sounds awesome
2015-05-21T19:23:56 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:20:24 AM] Dana Ayotte: I'm hoping to find some folks around here, though I'm not sure how to go about it yet
2015-05-21T19:23:57 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:20:47 AM] sepideh shahi: That would be great!
2015-05-21T19:23:58 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:22:08 AM] Dana Ayotte: there is a Tetra society in Vancouver (it was started here actually, by one of our mayors), so maybe I should try there
2015-05-21T19:23:59 <danaayotte> [2015-05-20, 8:23:08 AM] sepideh shahi: Awesome, I also reached out to Maria and asked her if she knows anyone at Tetra who is willing to talk and share experiences. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know how it goes
2015-05-21T19:24:08 <danaayotte> a bit messy, but there you go
2015-05-21T19:25:25 <sepideh> thanks danaayotte

2015-05-21T20:01:15 <michelled> anastasiac, danaayotte: have you read Jutta recent email to the PGA list?
2015-05-21T20:01:25 <anastasiac> I just did
2015-05-21T20:01:32 <danaayotte> no, will do

2015-05-21T20:05:06 <colinclark> sepideh: I have a list for you for the cyberinfrastructure proposal
2015-05-21T20:05:12 <colinclark> but i think it would help for me to talk to you about it
2015-05-21T20:05:22 <sepideh> vidyo?
2015-05-21T20:05:26 <colinclark> i'm just on the phone with jutta, but can we talk on vidyo in 10 minutes
2015-05-21T20:05:36 <sepideh> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be on
2015-05-21T20:09:04 <anastasiac> michelled, there\xe2\x80\x99s a PGA call tomorrow. Kate was on today\xe2\x80\x99s NIDRR call, so she\xe2\x80\x99ll hopefully report on the outcome tomorrow, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss the impacts on the workshop agenda \xe2\x80\x93 and required preparation. It might be good to chat about it before that call (which is at 1pm)
2015-05-21T20:10:10 <anastasiac> I will likely be in the office tomorrow (will know for sure by 5:00pm today)
