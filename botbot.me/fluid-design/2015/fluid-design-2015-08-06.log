2015-08-06T17:37:34 <danayo> hey sepideh, Jess_, do you think we should change the name "Functional Packages" to something that describes the actual things (rather than the work packages under which they are being created)? If I understand correctly, a Functional Package is a description of the work that needs to be done, right? Rather than the product of that work? I may just be getting caught in semantics, but Till\'s comment about developing different
2015-08-06T17:37:35 <danayo> infrastructures got me thinking that it might be better to refer to them as systems or services or ?
2015-08-06T17:38:38 <danayo> this sentence: The foundation of the Infrastructure Model shows those systems that are and should always be available to the functional packages of P4A.
2015-08-06T17:39:18 <danayo> got me thinking
2015-08-06T17:39:41 <sepideh> good point, so you mean replacing the functional packages with functional services, or finctional systems?
2015-08-06T17:39:53 <danayo> yeah, something like that
2015-08-06T17:40:29 <danayo> in one way it seems minor (just a word change), and in another seems realy important
2015-08-06T17:40:58 <danayo> in terms of describing the way the infrastructure works
2015-08-06T17:41:02 <sepideh> I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not. if it makes the content to flow better and make it clearer, we can replace it.
2015-08-06T17:41:39 <sepideh> we should let Kevin know though since he may have refered to them as functional packages in his report
2015-08-06T17:44:23 <danayo> ok, well maybe let\'s see what Jess_ and colinclark think, sepideh. I\'ll leave it for now
2015-08-06T17:44:37 <sepideh> sure
2015-08-06T17:45:03 <Jess_> it does seem clearer
2015-08-06T17:45:06 <Jess_> i support clearer
2015-08-06T18:06:21 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: are we having the design crit now?
2015-08-06T18:08:36 <anastasiac> let\xe2\x80\x99s gather in the Collab room
2015-08-06T18:08:49 <danayo> be there in 3
