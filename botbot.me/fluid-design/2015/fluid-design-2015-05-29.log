2015-05-29T17:18:14 <sepideh> michelled & anastasiac, could you please check these questions? Jim\xe2\x80\x99s initial question is \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever used a computer before?\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-05-29T17:18:33 <sepideh> And these are the following question:Have you ever used a computer before?
2015-05-29T17:18:33 <sepideh> \xe2\x80\xa2\tYes
2015-05-29T17:18:35 <sepideh> o\tWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty with reading text on the screen?
2015-05-29T17:18:36 <sepideh> o\tWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty while typing?
2015-05-29T17:18:38 <sepideh> o\tWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty with screen readers?
2015-05-29T17:18:39 <sepideh> \xe2\x80\xa2\tNo
2015-05-29T17:18:41 <sepideh> o\tWas it because of accessibility?
2015-05-29T17:18:42 <sepideh> Have you ever used a computer before?
2015-05-29T17:18:44 <sepideh> \xe2\x80\xa2\tYes
2015-05-29T17:18:45 <sepideh> o\tWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty with reading text on the screen?
2015-05-29T17:18:47 <sepideh> o\tWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty while typing?
2015-05-29T17:18:48 <sepideh> o\tWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty with screen readers?
2015-05-29T17:18:49 <sepideh> \xe2\x80\xa2\tNo
2015-05-29T17:18:50 <sepideh> o\tWas it because of accessibility?
2015-05-29T17:19:08 <sepideh> sorry, I paseted it twice\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-05-29T17:19:26 <michelled> sepideh: I don't think that 'screen readers' and 'accessibility' are generally understood terms
2015-05-29T17:19:35 <michelled> what are you trying to get at with those questions?
2015-05-29T17:19:39 <anastasiac> \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you used a computer, have you noticed any difficulty with screen readers?\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really make sense
2015-05-29T17:19:43 <anastasiac> especially in this context
2015-05-29T17:20:06 <sepideh> To find out which FD screen we should show next
2015-05-29T17:20:07 <anastasiac> \xe2\x80\x9cwas it because of accessibility\xe2\x80\x9d might not be understood, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll need some more specific questions
2015-05-29T17:20:48 <sepideh> I know, these are from Jim\xe2\x80\x99s wiki page, so we have to be more specific.
2015-05-29T17:21:39 <michelled> oh, i see
2015-05-29T17:24:00 <sepideh> I think the questions regarding reading and typing are clear and we can use them as the following questions for \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever used a computer\xe2\x80\x9d question
2015-05-29T17:24:41 <sepideh> And if they hae never used a computer, we can take them to the welcome page and don\xe2\x80\x99t ask any more questions
2015-05-29T17:39:51 <anastasiac> sepideh, that sounds good. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as thorough as Jim imagined, but it illustrates the idea, and we can elaborate that it could be more thorough
2015-05-29T17:40:32 <sepideh> great, i\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the first draft of mock up in an hour and we can modify it more today
2015-05-29T17:40:37 <sepideh> thx anastasiac
2015-05-29T17:45:19 <sepideh> hi jhung, do you know where I can find the final set of icons to be used in the mockup?
2015-05-29T18:03:56 <jhung> I sepideh. Let me find you a link sepideh
2015-05-29T18:05:12 <jhung> sepideh: you can find it under mockups > preference editor mockups > PGA > assets
2015-05-29T18:05:23 <sepideh> great! thanks
2015-05-29T18:05:32 <jhung> you'll find 18 svg files there
2015-05-29T18:05:41 <sepideh> awesome
2015-05-29T18:35:39 <sepideh> anastasiac could you please have look at the order of these screens. I have proposed 4 different combinations. I have taken out caption, screen alerts, and onscreen keyboard to simplify the process. Let me know what you thik of the order and then I can start polishing the frames. https://www.dropbox.com/s/oet8m3wcb9gco99/FD%20Tool-Rebranding-Sepi.pdf?dl=0
2015-05-29T18:35:42 <sepideh> thx
2015-05-29T18:37:13 <anastasiac> looking, sepideh
2015-05-29T18:42:05 <sepideh> I have also changed the language on the welcome screen and the confirmation/ congratulation page to match the intake process
2015-05-29T18:45:48 <anastasiac> sepideh: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start typing random thoughts in here, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget them...
2015-05-29T18:46:02 <anastasiac> change \xe2\x80\x9cdo you prefer\xe2\x80\x9d voice to \xe2\x80\x9cwould you like to have\xe2\x80\x9d...
2015-05-29T18:46:30 <anastasiac> sepideh: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how the top row of screens fits in with the rest - is that an alternative to the rest?
2015-05-29T18:46:55 <sepideh> this is when user express no difficulty at all
2015-05-29T18:47:14 <sepideh> so, they are taken straight to the registration process
2015-05-29T18:49:00 <anastasiac> I think if you have arrows labelled \xe2\x80\x9canswer \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9canswer \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d you could probably remove the repeat of the same screen with that answer selected. It might make it easier to follow
2015-05-29T18:51:23 <sepideh> for sure, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should show the final mockup in this format. There are too many screens and very hard to to follow. I just wanted to make sure the screens and their order make sense and then I can finalize them.
2015-05-29T18:51:59 <anastasiac> sepideh: I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure if I\xe2\x80\x99m accurately following the order of the screens, so you may already be doing what I\xe2\x80\x99m about to suggest: if the user has said \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9chave you had trouble seeing the screen,\xe2\x80\x9d skip the text to speech (and speech rate) and all visual adjustments
2015-05-29T18:52:31 <sepideh> exactly!
2015-05-29T18:53:37 <sepideh> So, first row from top: User can read and type >> straight to the form
2015-05-29T18:53:48 <anastasiac> sepideh: perhaps re-word questions from \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want to \xe2\x80\x9c to \xe2\x80\x9cwould you like to \xe2\x80\x9c
2015-05-29T18:53:56 <anastasiac> yep
2015-05-29T18:54:21 <sepideh> Second row from top: User can read but can\xe2\x80\x99t type >> screens for sticky keys
2015-05-29T18:54:24 <anastasiac> sepideh: that first row would still be prefaced by the language and welcome and the other preliminary questions, right?
2015-05-29T18:54:56 <sepideh> absolutely, those are the strating points
2015-05-29T18:55:02 <anastasiac> sepideh: second row still includes captions, btw
2015-05-29T18:55:15 <anastasiac> and alerts
2015-05-29T18:55:27 <sepideh> do have videos in intake? in that case we need caption
2015-05-29T18:55:57 <sepideh> Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring them back
2015-05-29T18:56:08 <anastasiac> good point, sepideh. But I think if you\xe2\x80\x99ve just asked the person about keyboard and they\xe2\x80\x99ve said they have trouble, follow through wtih the keyboard screens before asking other questions
2015-05-29T18:56:59 <anastasiac> and maybe preface the captions screen with a new screen that asks if they ever have trouble hearing TV or movies?
2015-05-29T18:57:05 <sepideh> Ok, let me clarify the flow a bit more. and I\xe2\x80\x99l share with you again:)
2015-05-29T18:57:09 <anastasiac> and skip the captions question if they say now
2015-05-29T18:57:16 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s looking really great, sepideh.
2015-05-29T18:57:19 <anastasiac> Jim is going to love it!
2015-05-29T18:57:26 <sepideh> ;)
2015-05-29T19:38:42 <sepideh> anastasiac: here is cleaner version of the flow. I still haven\xe2\x80\x99t included caption, as it would add 4 more combination to the flow and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if we want to go to that level of granularity for the mockup. https://www.dropbox.com/s/oet8m3wcb9gco99/FD%20Tool-Rebranding-Sepi.pdf?dl=0
2015-05-29T19:39:45 <anastasiac> oh, sepideh, just looking at the fully zoomed out file, it looks lovely! :-)
2015-05-29T19:40:44 <sepideh> thx, the problem start when you zoom in:D
2015-05-29T19:40:59 <anastasiac> LOL
2015-05-29T19:41:09 <anastasiac> nope, it just gets better and better, sepideh
2015-05-29T19:42:35 <anastasiac> sepideh, this looks great. I suggest you share it with everyone before working on it anymore, since you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably get some good suggestions.
2015-05-29T19:43:05 <sepideh> great idea. Thanks anastasiac for all your help today :)
