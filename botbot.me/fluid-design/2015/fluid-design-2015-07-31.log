2015-07-31T18:24:12 <sepideh> Hi danayo and murilocrivellari, could you please have a quick look at these and let me know what you think? David needs the final versions in an hour, so I wanted to make sure there is no major problem with these banners. https://www.dropbox.com/s/kjwhz0l9jj6yvox/IDRC%20Banners.pdf?dl=0
2015-07-31T18:24:16 <sepideh> Thanks a lot
2015-07-31T18:25:22 <murilocrivellari> sepideh: what should we pay attention to the most?
2015-07-31T18:25:53 <danayo> sepideh how big are these?
2015-07-31T18:28:24 <danayo> and what are they for?
2015-07-31T18:29:48 <sepideh> danayo: they are 24\xe2\x80\x9dx72\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-07-31T18:30:51 <sepideh> I think there is an inclusive design show/exhibit next week. and we have a table there. And they want to use these banner around that table, I guess\xe2\x80\xa6

2015-07-31T18:32:58 <danayo> ok. i just noticed the subtle link between the two - the lines/boxes from one banner trailing to the next. Not sure how important it is but it seems a bit too subtle - then again when they're big it'll probably be more obvious.
2015-07-31T18:33:01 <danayo> I think they look good
2015-07-31T18:34:28 <danayo> might be nice if those 3 box/sides connected more strongly with the rectangular lines above somehow, but I don't think it's a big deal
2015-07-31T18:34:31 <danayo> sepideh ^
2015-07-31T18:35:01 <danayo> I like the colours and overlapping transparency effect a lot
2015-07-31T18:35:40 <sepideh> thanks danayo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to play with those rectabgles a bit more
2015-07-31T18:40:00 <murilocrivellari> sepideh: I have two comments: 1 - I don't know if it was requested, but don't you think it might be a good idea to have contact info (such as address or phone number)? and 2 - Have you considered making the text size bigger for the projects' description in the first one? Maybe it's not necessary, but it might be easier to read from a distance, and you still
2015-07-31T18:40:00 <murilocrivellari> have white space on the bottom
2015-07-31T18:41:57 <sepideh> Great! thank, murilocrivellari, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the text size larger:)
