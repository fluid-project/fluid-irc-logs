2015-06-01T16:23:18 <danayo> thanks murilo_crivellar
2015-06-01T16:23:28 <danayo> at first glance it looks great
2015-06-01T16:23:40 <danayo> let me take a closer look and I\'ll ping you to discuss
2015-06-01T16:24:21 <murilo_crivellar> ok, thanks danayo
2015-06-01T16:24:45 <danayo> can we do it in about an hour murilo_crivellar?
2015-06-01T16:25:13 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: sure, sounds good to me

2015-06-01T17:54:41 <danayo> anastasiac: is your understanding of the "key debounce" preference requirement that it is the equivalent of slow keys? or something else?
2015-06-01T17:55:10 <anastasiac> oy, good question, danayo. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look it up
2015-06-01T17:57:12 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-06-01T17:58:41 <anastasiac> danayo: my impression is that debounce is not the same as slow keys. Slow keys is meant for people who tend to hold a key down for a long time. Slow keys can prevent that from being interpreted as repeated characters. Debounce is for people who tend to bounce, i.e. press a key up and down repeatedly, perhaps because of tremors. Debounce can prevent the extra keystrokes from being registered
2015-06-01T17:59:07 <danayo> so, wouldn\'t key repeat delay address the later?
2015-06-01T17:59:17 <danayo> ah no
2015-06-01T17:59:18 <danayo> i see
2015-06-01T17:59:24 <danayo> key is not being held down
2015-06-01T17:59:56 <danayo> hmmmm
2015-06-01T18:00:22 <danayo> key repeat delay should actually address the issue of someone holding down a key for a long time, no?
2015-06-01T18:03:04 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: sorry for the delay, just trying to sort out some questions I have about the keyboard preferences
2015-06-01T18:04:31 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: I\'m following your conversation. In fact, the "key debounce" thing was a question of mine as well
2015-06-01T18:13:00 <danayo> anastasiac, so are you saying that a key debounce preference would control whether or not a key press results in a character output based on the time between multiple key presses?
2015-06-01T18:13:33 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-06-01T18:14:12 <anastasiac> danayo: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is
2015-06-01T18:15:30 <danayo> OK. re: slow keys - I think it would actually be helpful not for those who hold a key down for a long time but for someone who may have a tremor and hit a key accidentally, since it sets a delay between key press and key activation
2015-06-01T18:15:46 <danayo> and that key repeat delay would apply to the case you describe (holding a key down for a long time)
2015-06-01T18:19:11 <danayo> anyway, it sounds like key repeat delay and key debounce evaluation pref screens will look exactly the same to the user - but on the back end we\'d have to determine whether the multiple characters are a result of holding one key down, or of hitting the same key multiple times
2015-06-01T18:19:30 <danayo> (eventually that is)
2015-06-01T18:22:24 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: can we talk through wireframes now?
2015-06-01T18:23:04 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: sure

2015-06-01T19:08:02 <danayo> jhung, Justin_o i\'m looking at the styling of the buttons in the http://anywhereballot.com (voting section), and I have two questions about the 3D effect on the buttons - do you think we should try to copy those effects (the drop shadow and curved effect) and also, how easy would that be to implement? if it\'s not worth doing, I\'ll just match the colours and leave them "flat" as they are in our tool now
2015-06-01T19:08:33 <danayo> I can\'t actually tell if the curved effect is intentional or not as it runs the length of the black upper and lower bars
2015-06-01T19:08:49 <danayo> and I\'m sure there\'s better lingo for it than "the curved effect" :)
2015-06-01T19:09:02 <danayo> (upper half lighter than bottom)
2015-06-01T19:09:28 <jhung> danayo: flat is much easier. We can give it a gradient to mimic the effect, but it won\'t be curved\xe2\x80\xa6 more of a horizontal gradient.
2015-06-01T19:10:26 <jhung> My vote it to keep it flat though since the rest of the FD interface is pretty flat.
2015-06-01T19:11:35 <danayo> ok jhung
2015-06-01T19:15:06 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-06-01T19:15:30 <anastasiac> danayo: the last assessment wireframes I see have no \xe2\x80\x9ccongratulations\xe2\x80\x9d screen - is that right?
2015-06-01T19:21:23 <danayo> yeah - I\'m still updating those but yeah - I added a confirmation screen, but it made sense to me to go straight from confirm screen into test. do you agree?
2015-06-01T19:27:38 * colinclark has quit
2015-06-01T19:28:20 <danayo> I guess I sort of conflated confirm and congrats in this case
2015-06-01T19:28:34 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-06-01T19:38:11 <anastasiac> danayo: there\xe2\x80\x99s generally no confirm screen (not implemented yet), so: should I keep the congrats screen, or skip it and go straight to the test?
2015-06-01T19:38:21 <danayo> ah right
2015-06-01T19:38:56 <danayo> let\'s keep it and change the wording to what i have in the wireframes now
2015-06-01T19:39:00 <sepideh> danayo and anastasiac could you please have a look and let me kow what you think? Thanks, https://www.dropbox.com/s/oet8m3wcb9gco99/FD%20Tool-Rebranding-Sepi.pdf?dl=0

2015-06-01T20:19:11 <danayo> yes let me find it
2015-06-01T20:19:23 <danayo> anastasiac
2015-06-01T20:32:02 <danayo> anastasiac the link is here http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/15/article-2629356-1DE0BFB200000578-646_634x737.jpg
2015-06-01T20:32:29 <danayo> but I just realised I didn\'t filter my search for open use
2015-06-01T20:32:41 <anastasiac> ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a static image, not interactive...
2015-06-01T20:32:47 <danayo> yes
2015-06-01T20:33:09 <danayo> I added the radio buttons in the wireframes
2015-06-01T20:41:35 <danayo> jhung, anastasiac, Justin_o, cindyli voting wireframes are here https://www.dropbox.com/s/d7tow5u5y3ykx7p/FD%20tool%20voting.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-01T20:41:47 <danayo> I haven\'t updated the icons in any of these wireframes yet but I will
2015-06-01T20:41:50 <danayo> now
2015-06-01T20:42:09 <danayo> oh and just noticed the step numbers are off
2015-06-01T20:43:11 <danayo> the anywhere ballot has it\'s own step numbers which begin once the user starts voting jhung anastasiac
2015-06-01T20:43:21 <danayo> I think we should get rid of step numbers in the FD tool in this case
2015-06-01T20:43:37 <danayo> especially since there are so few
2015-06-01T20:43:40 <danayo> yes?
2015-06-01T20:44:40 <anastasiac> danayo, yes that makes sense to me

2015-06-01T21:09:09 <danayo> anastasiac what do you think of this for voting? The 3 icons and progress looked a little odd on their own so I tried numbers instead...https://www.dropbox.com/s/d7tow5u5y3ykx7p/FD%20tool%20voting.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-01T21:09:38 <danayo> just an idea - if it adds a lot more work we can leave it as-is of course
2015-06-01T21:09:49 <anastasiac> ooh, I like it, danayo \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c1, 2, 3, vote!\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-06-01T21:10:06 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much work it would be, but actually, quite possible not much
2015-06-01T21:10:26 <anastasiac> the icons are just a character, specified in the stylesheet, right?
2015-06-01T21:10:36 <anastasiac> so, use a different character :-)
2015-06-01T21:11:29 <anastasiac> and actually, danayo, it demonstrates customization of the icons, which is a plus
2015-06-01T21:11:44 <danayo> yes
2015-06-01T21:11:46 <danayo> cool
