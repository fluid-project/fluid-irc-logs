2015-07-09T14:18:49 <murilocrivellari> good morning, sepideh, would you please take a look at these files when you have the chance? One is the chart authoring tool wireframe overview (I put all the screens together just to document them. The changes for the first screen have been applied). And the other is the charts applied to OER contexts: (1)

2015-07-09T14:19:24 <sepideh> for sure murilocrivellari
2015-07-09T14:19:36 <murilocrivellari> sepideh: thanks! :)
2015-07-09T14:21:16 <sepideh> murilocrivellari: what is the angle value?
2015-07-09T14:22:49 <murilocrivellari> sepideh: while doing a research on pie charts questions, I realized angle values are often used. For instance, sometimes you'll be given percentages and be asked to find the angle of that section
2015-07-09T14:23:42 <murilocrivellari> so i think it might be worth it adding angle values
2015-07-09T14:24:12 <murilocrivellari> automatically calculated, that is sepideh ^
2015-07-09T14:24:21 <sepideh> That\xe2\x80\x99s right.
