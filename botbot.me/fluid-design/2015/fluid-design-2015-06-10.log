2015-06-10T17:19:49 <maozillah> good call danayo
2015-06-10T17:19:54 <danayo> :)
2015-06-10T17:20:36 <danayo> do you want to work on mocking up the UIO designs with the new toggle? I also created a slightly smaller version that might fit better https://www.dropbox.com/s/1xocuf70ig1d0j0/adjuster-on-off-UIO.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-10T17:20:51 <maozillah> okay wondering about having the selected button a little more visually visible
2015-06-10T17:21:07 <maozillah> ex. inverse coloring? for the selected
2015-06-10T17:21:28 <danayo> sure. one consideration for the design was how it would look in the contrast themes
2015-06-10T17:21:40 <danayo> so I was avoiding mixing the light text on dark and dark text on light
2015-06-10T17:21:49 <maozillah> yes, i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about that\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-06-10T17:22:12 <danayo> some of the feedback we got from Cloud4All testing was to keep it consistent
2015-06-10T17:22:14 <maozillah> it feels like too many outlines atm with the outline around the off and then also outline around the entire toggle
2015-06-10T17:22:21 <danayo> right
2015-06-10T17:22:31 <maozillah> perhaps making the arrow icon larger or bolding the OFF
2015-06-10T17:22:42 <maozillah> will be a clearer indicator of it being selected
2015-06-10T17:23:45 <danayo> which arrow icon maozillah?
2015-06-10T17:23:50 <maozillah> the checkmark icon
2015-06-10T17:23:59 <maozillah> sorry, should have been more clear with my language
2015-06-10T17:24:01 <danayo> ah
2015-06-10T17:24:58 <danayo> I think there are some concerns about text alignment/moving around when going from regular to bold
2015-06-10T17:25:23 <danayo> also, here are some suggestted hover/focus states https://www.dropbox.com/s/41hykc7aztl9uhq/adjuster-on-off-states.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-10T17:25:56 <maozillah> and yes! I can mockup the UIO with the new toggle and new copy for the other panels
2015-06-10T17:26:37 <danayo> great. also, here is another toggle design - page 5 https://www.dropbox.com/s/t48ozkd2bjg4x78/Crestron%20panel%20May%2021.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-10T17:26:39 <maozillah> Hmmm, will have to think more on that
2015-06-10T17:28:33 <danayo> with the triangle/caret it 's consistent with contrast panel
2015-06-10T17:28:42 <maozillah> I like the weight of the yellow arrow, wonder if reversing the hover state with the normal
2015-06-10T17:28:48 <maozillah> so for hover have the box
2015-06-10T17:28:53 <maozillah> and then for selected the inverse
2015-06-10T17:29:34 <maozillah> but i\xe2\x80\x99m not very familiar with what constraints are present for the other view modes
2015-06-10T17:30:01 <danayo> got a few minutes to talk on vidyo?
2015-06-10T17:30:21 <maozillah> yep, just haven\xe2\x80\x99t used vidyo before so probably have to setup
2015-06-10T17:30:40 <danayo> ok, I'm going to email you a link
2015-06-10T17:30:48 <maozillah> thanks!
2015-06-10T17:31:22 <danayo> except I don't have your email address!

2015-06-10T17:35:02 <maozillah> do i set up an account through vidyo? danayo
2015-06-10T17:35:48 <danayo> do you have vidyo installed on you machine maozillah?
2015-06-10T17:35:55 <maozillah> yep
2015-06-10T17:36:01 <maozillah> oh wait

2015-06-10T20:10:05 <danayo> Justin_o anastasiac michelled can any of you tell me where I might find the files that used to be at this link?  https://source.fluidproject.org/svn/design/\x0f
2015-06-10T20:10:26 <danayo> I am trying to find joanna's UIO wireframes that match the current implementation
2015-06-10T20:10:42 <danayo> The files in dropbox and on the wiki seem to be a slightly older version
2015-06-10T20:14:59 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-06-10T20:16:06 * clown joined the channel
2015-06-10T20:18:02 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-06-10T20:22:30 <danayo> maozillah: it's possible that the current implementation of UIO was based on the wireframes we have, and that changes were made during implementation that aren't reflected in the wireframes. anastasiac: do you remember if that's the case?
2015-06-10T20:22:43 <danayo> anyway, they are quite similar
2015-06-10T20:23:23 <anastasiac> danayo, maozillah: I can\xe2\x80\x99t recall specifically if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. That happens
2015-06-10T20:23:33 <danayo> yes
2015-06-10T20:23:48 <maozillah> ok, can i get linked to the wireframes?
2015-06-10T20:24:02 <maozillah> or rather, is there a way i can search for these things myself
2015-06-10T20:24:06 <maozillah> if there\xe2\x80\x99s a global dropbox
2015-06-10T20:24:10 <maozillah> for the design elements
2015-06-10T20:24:19 <danayo> oh, yes, it's the one I sent you ealier: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7v0nf3e4fb6zajh/UPDATESVNuio-highfidelity-version3-onpage.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-10T20:24:52 <danayo> also, it's all documented on the wiki here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+UI+Options+Design
2015-06-10T20:25:24 <danayo> which is linked from main wiki page here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=29959408
2015-06-10T20:26:05 <maozillah> danayo: thanks!

2015-06-10T20:55:15 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you know where in the FD tool code the ui enhancer is actually added to the tool? where is that done? who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible? where is the subcomponent declared?
2015-06-10T20:56:13 <anastasiac> ah, found it, Justin_o. The FD tool doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, the demo does it
2015-06-10T20:56:17 <anastasiac> isn\xe2\x80\x99t that weird?
2015-06-10T20:56:21 <anastasiac> is that normal?
2015-06-10T20:57:30 <anastasiac> ok, no, Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong again. My question still stands: who adds the UIE to the page?
2015-06-10T20:58:40 <anastasiac> and same for the settings store, actually...
