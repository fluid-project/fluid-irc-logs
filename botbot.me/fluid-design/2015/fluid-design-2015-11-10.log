b"2015-11-10T21:05:25 <jessm> which is a very very good realization
2015-11-10T21:05:51 <danayo> :)
2015-11-10T21:07:58 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-11-10T21:08:33 <michelled> I was just chatting with sepidehshahi and it seems like we need a little more detail for a number of things before we can make some concrete plans for February
2015-11-10T21:08:55 <michelled> on Thursday morning, there is a P4A call where the details for 404.1 and 404.2 will be hashed out
2015-11-10T21:09:27 <michelled> also on Thursday, at the crit, it seems like we should do a crit on the existing mobile UIO wireframes - danayo could you lead that?
2015-11-10T21:09:41 <michelled> that will give us a sense of what actually needs to happen for February
2015-11-10T21:09:55 <michelled> then we can figure out how long everything will take and work out a plan
2015-11-10T21:09:58 <michelled> how does that sound?
2015-11-10T21:10:34 <jessm> michelled: danayo is away Thurs
2015-11-10T21:11:24 <michelled> ah, well, that's less good :) danayo how about the week after open ed - can you lead a crit on the mobile UIO wireframes?
2015-11-10T21:11:40 <michelled> I know you didn't design them, but you are probably the most knowledgable about them
2015-11-10T21:12:26 <colinclark> Seems like a pretty reasonable first step, michelled
2015-11-10T21:12:37 <colinclark> thanks for offering to help us corral all this work!
2015-11-10T21:12:44 <colinclark> there's so much of it, yet it's all so awesome
2015-11-10T21:12:53 <colinclark> which is way better than if it were boring work :)
2015-11-10T21:13:51 <danayo> yes michelled, i can do that
2015-11-10T21:14:03 <danayo> hopefully can find my notes from the last time before then!
2015-11-10T21:15:29 <michelled> :)
2015-11-10T21:15:48 <michelled> I'm *really* glad we had this conversation - everything seems much clearer and doable now
2015-11-10T21:17:14 <anastasiac> if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too early to start listening to xmas music, does that mean it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too early to start drinking egg nog?
2015-11-10T21:18:19 <danayo> AND EATING SHORTBREAD
2015-11-10T21:18:54 <michelled> Oh! and making chocolate caramels \xe2\x80\xa6.
2015-11-10T21:19:27 <anastasiac> mmm\xe2\x80\xa6 shortbread\xe2\x80\xa6

2015-11-10T21:26:02 <danayo> I'm thinking I'll create the summary page with more general info, and add this page as a link from there
2015-11-10T21:26:04 <danayo> along with all the others
2015-11-10T21:26:12 <danayo> and also reorganise the sketches page

2015-11-10T21:48:09 <danayo> sepidehshahi: doing some work to reorganise the sonificaiton wiki pages - does the plan above sound good to you?
2015-11-10T21:49:18 <sepidehshahi> danayo: it makes totall sense. Thank you for doing this:)
2015-11-10T21:51:34 <danayo> np sepidehshahi. here is the landing page i've started https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/editpage.action?pageId=55574549

b'2015-11-10T19:44:04 <colinclark> So, you mentioned the other day that you were looking at things to do
2015-11-10T19:44:16 <colinclark> I guess you\'ve got some Open Ed work on your plate
2015-11-10T19:44:26 <colinclark> I was thinking, if you need work, that there are a couple of things on my mind
2015-11-10T19:44:45 <colinclark> First, I was thinking that it would be really helpful to have a kind of "summary page" for the sonification work we\'ve been doing
2015-11-10T19:44:52 <colinclark> something intended for an outside audience
2015-11-10T19:45:09 <colinclark> Describing what our goals are, what we\'re working on, where we\'re going with it
2015-11-10T19:45:22 <colinclark> with easy-to-find links to the latest wireframes and sound designs
2015-11-10T19:45:24 <colinclark> and to the demo
2015-11-10T19:45:25 <danayo> yes, actually, I was thinking I should reorganize that page since it\'s getting unweildy
2015-11-10T19:45:30 <colinclark> Totally
2015-11-10T19:45:30 <danayo> and that sounds like a good idea
2015-11-10T19:45:46 <colinclark> Something where if you were talking to people at Open Ed and they said "That sounds so cool, where can I learn more?"
2015-11-10T19:45:55 <colinclark> then you\'d have a handy link to give them
2015-11-10T19:46:09 <colinclark> perhaps one that anastasiac can write a news article about or post on the Floe web site
2015-11-10T19:46:39 <danayo> that sounds good colinclark
2015-11-10T19:48:19 <danayo> also,  I talked to jessm yesterday about working on the best practices guidelines that we\'ve agreed to create for P4A
2015-11-10T19:48:28 <danayo> (which is what brought up the design thinking / guidelines discussion)
2015-11-10T19:48:43 <colinclark> What\'s the best practices guidelines for P4A?
2015-11-10T19:49:02 <colinclark> I haven\'t heard about this, maybe you or jessm can summarize?
2015-11-10T19:49:42 <colinclark> danayo: The other thing that came to mind is UIO
2015-11-10T19:49:52 <colinclark> it\'s the next frontier for pending development
2015-11-10T19:49:58 <danayo> yes, mobile? michelled mentioned that too
2015-11-10T19:50:00 <colinclark> I even hear rumors that michelled is hacking on it
2015-11-10T19:50:04 <danayo> ah!
2015-11-10T19:50:05 <colinclark> yup, mobile and accessibility
2015-11-10T19:50:13 <colinclark> any design work to pick up where we left off
2015-11-10T19:50:17 <colinclark> in terms of mobile
2015-11-10T19:51:25 <danayo> yes, there\'s much to pick up on for mobile UIO
2015-11-10T19:51:36 <colinclark> I wonder where we should start
2015-11-10T19:51:41 <colinclark> do you have any thoughts, danayo?
2015-11-10T19:51:59 <michelled> danayo: when jessm and colinclark and I talked about the February Hewlett meetings, we talked about trying to have the mobile UIO ready for that
2015-11-10T19:52:06 <anastasiac> danayo: that \xe2\x80\x98calling of an engineer\xe2\x80\x99 page is bringin back memories :-)
2015-11-10T19:52:17 <danayo> nice, anastasiac :)
2015-11-10T19:52:25 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-11-10T19:52:27 <danayo> ok michelled
2015-11-10T19:52:59 <danayo> i need to refresh my memory on the last discussion we had around joanna\'s mobile designs colinclark michelled
2015-11-10T19:54:10 <danayo> not sure if "official" notes were taken? but I should be able to find notes that I made
2015-11-10T19:54:33 <danayo> which I should have made official :(
2015-11-10T19:54:43 <colinclark> no worries
2015-11-10T19:54:48 <colinclark> note taking is hard :)
2015-11-10T19:55:05 <colinclark> I guess one way to approach it is to try to come up with some little milestones
2015-11-10T19:55:19 <michelled> danayo: we could talk about the ones she made in a crit, I suppose and take new notes :)
2015-11-10T19:55:33 <colinclark> i.e. to work with michelled to identify some small design tweaks to start
2015-11-10T19:55:42 <colinclark> and have that spiral into a complete mobile redesign
2015-11-10T19:57:10 <danayo> +1 to working with michelled and a complete mobile redesign
2015-11-10T19:58:29 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-10T19:58:44 <colinclark> So are you cool to make an awesome summary page for our sonification work, danayo?
2015-11-10T19:58:57 <colinclark> and then we can coordinate with anastasiac to post it to the Floe site
2015-11-10T19:59:12 <colinclark> and then you and michelled can do some mobile UIO?
2015-11-10T20:00:40 <michelled> sounds great to me
2015-11-10T20:01:14 <danayo> sounds good colinclark michelled
2015-11-10T20:01:26 <colinclark> awesome
2015-11-10T20:02:13 <colinclark> danayo: What did you use to generate your beeps, by the way?
2015-11-10T20:02:24 <colinclark> Some kind of synth built into Garage Band?
2015-11-10T20:02:35 <danayo> yes colinclark
2015-11-10T20:02:45 <colinclark> Which synth was it?
2015-11-10T20:02:51 <danayo> checking now...
2015-11-10T20:03:34 <danayo> vintage electric piano > classic suitcase Mk IV !
2015-11-10T20:04:00 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-11-10T20:04:04 <danayo> colinclark ^
2015-11-10T20:04:17 <jessm> danayo: you want to explain the best practice guidelines from P4A and the tie-in we talked about with Floe \xe2\x80\x94 in answer to colinclark question \xe2\x80\x94 it looks like that got mentioned above but might be hanging
2015-11-10T20:04:31 <colinclark> danayo: Aha, ok
2015-11-10T20:04:36 <colinclark> so it\'s a Fender Rhodes emulator
2015-11-10T20:04:43 <colinclark> that helps a lot, danayo
2015-11-10T20:05:05 <danayo> cool
2015-11-10T20:05:47 <danayo> yes jessm, i will try
2015-11-10T20:09:21 <danayo> so this is straight from the DoW jessm colinclark: \xe2\x80\xa2 Identify good practice guidelines for internal project use as they pertain to business practices, infrastructure design and user experience design for required transactions.
2015-11-10T20:09:22 <danayo> \xe2\x80\xa2 Outline initial good practice guidelines for external use.
2015-11-10T20:10:13 <danayo> with the audience being all P4A stakeholders
2015-11-10T20:10:55 <colinclark> Meaning, people who are paid to work on some part of the P4A project, is that right danayo?
2015-11-10T20:10:55 <danayo> and we had discussed in the past the ideas of a "field guide" and/or "method cards" for inclusive design
2015-11-10T20:11:02 <colinclark> Right
2015-11-10T20:11:46 <danayo> i think both internal to P4A (paid) as well as not ("external use")
2015-11-10T20:11:52 <colinclark> ah, ok
2015-11-10T20:12:13 <colinclark> So basically, these guidelines we\'d hope would be useful to anyone who is interested in inclusive design?
2015-11-10T20:12:19 <jessm> and we talked about how this could tie-in with Floe and the mention of the miniaturized IDLH we talked about last week
2015-11-10T20:12:34 <danayo> yes and yes
2015-11-10T20:14:12 <danayo> I understood that it would apply much more broadly than just to P4A
2015-11-10T20:14:35 <jessm> and be cute and small \xe2\x80\x94 dont\xe2\x80\x99 forget that part
2015-11-10T20:14:39 <jessm> :P
2015-11-10T20:15:03 <danayo> right!
2015-11-10T20:15:52 <jessm> and it would be folded into the deliverable we\xe2\x80\x99re all working on alongside the \xe2\x80\x9cdesign specifications\xe2\x80\x9d that sepidehshahi has been thinking about
2015-11-10T20:16:04 <jessm> the re-deliverable
2015-11-10T20:17:00 <colinclark> Cute and small sounds great
2015-11-10T20:17:26 <colinclark> I don\'t have any sense of priority here
2015-11-10T20:17:28 <colinclark> which is really important
2015-11-10T20:17:46 <colinclark> Certainly, from the perspective of Floe, this is something we can work slowly on, think about
2015-11-10T20:18:09 <colinclark> so as to integrate our latest thinking regarding inclusive design tools and patterns
2015-11-10T20:18:19 <colinclark> From the Prosperity4All perspective, I\'m less clear on relative priority
2015-11-10T20:18:32 <jessm> the deliverables are all due feb 2016
2015-11-10T20:18:35 <colinclark> michelled: Where does this fit in terms of your rainbows?
2015-11-10T20:19:18 <michelled> well, we have a lot due in February
2015-11-10T20:20:16 <michelled> in terms of Floe, the Hewlett meetings will be happening
2015-11-10T20:20:39 <colinclark> I forget, was that the milestone you were aiming for with the UIO mobile work?
2015-11-10T20:21:03 <michelled> we had decided we wanted to show it at the Hewlett meetings in Feb
2015-11-10T20:21:04 <colinclark> danayo: I\'d love to work on the cards with you--it would be so cool
2015-11-10T20:21:30 <colinclark> and I can imagine I\'m not the only one
2015-11-10T20:21:31 <michelled> we also wanted to show designs for the self assessment work as well as the working chart authoring prototype
2015-11-10T20:21:42 <colinclark> oh yes, that is a lot
2015-11-10T20:21:47 <jessm> michelled: we had sort of mentioned it for the mtgs. and also mentioned self-assessment, etc. im not sure what JTs priorities for that meeting are
2015-11-10T20:21:51 <jessm> ah, yes,
2015-11-10T20:22:32 <michelled> jessm: yes, I\'m referring to the meeting where you, colinclark and myself filled in our plans in the pastel spreadsheet which contains all of the upcoming work and deadlines
2015-11-10T20:23:08 <colinclark> It\'s hard to push off EC deliverables for long, especially ones that have already been extended--so we don\'t want to leave that hanging
2015-11-10T20:23:42 <michelled> we can certainly change our plans
2015-11-10T20:23:53 <michelled> we just need to look at the whole picture of everything when we do so :)
2015-11-10T20:24:25 <colinclark> the chart authoring work will probably be in pretty decent shape for February, michelled
2015-11-10T20:24:28 <colinclark> so that\'s a good start
2015-11-10T20:24:49 <colinclark> though it will be nice to get beyond just pie charts :)
2015-11-10T20:25:07 <michelled> well, one issue is that it will be shown off next week
2015-11-10T20:25:18 <colinclark> Ah, I see
2015-11-10T20:25:19 <michelled> and we want to show progress post Open Ed in Feb
2015-11-10T20:25:22 <colinclark> so you want to show progression
2015-11-10T20:25:23 <colinclark> right
2015-11-10T20:25:27 <colinclark> that seems wise
2015-11-10T20:26:08 <colinclark> sepidehshahi, danayo: Bar and line charts, plus personalizable sonifications would be cool for February
2015-11-10T20:26:11 <colinclark> perhaps ambitious
2015-11-10T20:26:30 <alanharnum> colinclark: I don\'t think bar charts would be too hard
2015-11-10T20:26:36 <michelled> I think we should show progress on other deliverables for Floe
2015-11-10T20:26:38 <colinclark> but we probably want to start to pursue the personalization angle as soon as we can--it helps tie the overall approach together
2015-11-10T20:26:42 <alanharnum> it\'s really just implementing the drawing of them
2015-11-10T20:26:49 <colinclark> alanharnum: That\'s good to know
2015-11-10T20:26:56 <alanharnum> their data model, etc, is the same as a pie chart
2015-11-10T20:28:05 <danayo> and with a couple of options for personalizable sonifications? would that be do-able?
2015-11-10T20:28:27 <danayo> colinclark +1 to collaborating on design cards
2015-11-10T20:28:40 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-11-10T20:30:59 <colinclark> awesome
2015-11-10T20:31:13 <colinclark> so I guess we just need to figure out how to balance the design cards with the mobile UIO work
2015-11-10T20:31:39 <colinclark> I can imagine that the mobile stuff involves a bunch of hard design work up front
2015-11-10T20:31:49 <colinclark> and then might involve a lot of slow development work
2015-11-10T20:32:04 <colinclark> I guess we could aim to design a couple of mobile UIO milestones up front
2015-11-10T20:32:15 <colinclark> and then switch in December to working on the design cards
2015-11-10T20:34:32 <danayo> and self-assessment - we also want something for Feb, right?
2015-11-10T20:37:23 <colinclark> Ideally, that would be good
2015-11-10T20:37:36 <colinclark> February seems like a busy time
2015-11-10T20:37:45 <colinclark> do we have other things on our personal roadmaps for that time?
2015-11-10T20:45:50 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-11-10T20:48:24 <michelled> sepidehshahi: thanks for sending me the list for D103.1 - it helps a lot!
2015-11-10T20:48:47 <michelled> danayo, sepidehshahi: do you have sense of how much time those tasks will take?
2015-11-10T20:49:00 <michelled> I\'m just trying to get a sense of what is feasible in the time we have :)
2015-11-10T20:50:53 <sepidehshahi> michelled: for moving stuff to wiki I may need a few days and for data visualization another few days. I think to update the report and include the new additions I may need something between 2-3 weeks
2015-11-10T20:51:38 <sepidehshahi> and ten we have to figure out what we need to do for D404. and based on that we can find out how much time we may need.
2015-11-10T20:52:12 <sepidehshahi> We can also include those card in the D103 report
2015-11-10T20:53:03 <michelled> sepidehshahi: is there a plan for determining what is left to do for D404.1 and D404.2?
2015-11-10T20:53:38 <michelled> danayo: do you have a sense of how long the cards will take - in order to get them to the point where they can be included in the D103.1 report?
2015-11-10T20:56:11 <danayo> my sense is that it\'s a good chunk of work michelled - maybe a month? jessm sepidehshahi am I way off? it seems to me it will involve a lot of iterating and discussing - but maybe we need to think of it in stages - the report perhaps being the first stage?
2015-11-10T20:58:11 <michelled> danayo: this is the work that anastasiac had expressed an interest in as well
2015-11-10T20:58:18 <michelled> it would be good to get her working with you
2015-11-10T21:03:42 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-11-10T21:03:57 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-11-10T21:04:56 <jessm> danayo: i do think it\xe2\x80\x99s a chunk and consider that this week is toast for you almost, next is open ed. that leaves one week in nov. then december and all its holiday-ness. which brings me to the conclusion, it actually ISN\xe2\x80\x99T too early to start listening to xmas music

2015-11-10T16:01:48 <jessm> danayo: some inspiration for the miniature best practices thingy http://www.fastcodesign.com/3053212/design-thinking-comes-to-kids-in-this-cute-board-game
2015-11-10T16:02:30 <danayo> thanks jessm
2015-11-10T16:07:49 <colinclark> I\'m impressed that even Fast Company has reservations about this kind of thing
2015-11-10T16:08:05 <colinclark> "here is something a bit unsettling about teaching 6- to 12-year-olds one of the prominent methodologies behind today\'s corporate culture"
2015-11-10T16:09:23 <colinclark> There\'s so much opportunity for us to question this kind of formalized, bite-sized, consumer-oriented approach to design that seems to prevail in the methods that companies offer up as "the way to do design"
2015-11-10T16:10:58 <colinclark> If inclusive design is about anything, it\'s about finding alternatives to this kind of bite-sized design salespitch
2015-11-10T16:12:20 <colinclark> something a little messier (but still concrete), and that moves design towards this shift from "users"
2015-11-10T16:12:49 <danayo> yeah, I was thinking about user-as-designer and co-design as two ideas that inform inclusive design and make it different from the norm
2015-11-10T16:13:18 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-10T16:13:19 <danayo> and interesting to think how this would make the "packaging" differnt too
2015-11-10T16:13:40 <colinclark> Those should be the starting point for our own articulation of design
2015-11-10T16:14:04 <colinclark> not so much as a process but as a material that people work with
2015-11-10T16:15:07 <colinclark> I was imagining, for example, that we could consider different types of customizations that users do in the world
2015-11-10T16:15:16 <colinclark> and talk about design strategies for supporting that in software
2015-11-10T16:15:57 <danayo> that sounds good colinclark
2015-11-10T16:16:04 <colinclark> a sort of blend of design patterns and concrete design techniques
2015-11-10T16:16:26 <colinclark> as opposed to the very abstract and corporate-y "design thinking" stuff
2015-11-10T16:16:39 <colinclark> That Christopher Alexander quote that simonjb reminded us of is just great
2015-11-10T16:16:49 <colinclark> in regards to the real (unrealized) power of patterns
2015-11-10T16:17:54 <colinclark> "People should design for themselves their own houses, streets and communities. This idea... comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people."
2015-11-10T16:18:54 <danayo> that makes me think of a jane jacobs quote
2015-11-10T16:19:00 <colinclark> ooh, what is it?
2015-11-10T16:19:15 <danayo> that is painted on a wall on christie st
2015-11-10T16:19:19 <colinclark> oh yes!
2015-11-10T16:19:20 <danayo> let me find it
2015-11-10T16:19:21 <colinclark> I love that one
2015-11-10T16:19:25 <colinclark> I have a photograph of it somewhere here
2015-11-10T16:19:26 <danayo> yes
2015-11-10T16:19:32 <colinclark> i think I gave a talk with it in it once
2015-11-10T16:19:36 <danayo> i rode by it every day...
2015-11-10T16:19:51 <simonjb> yeah, I feel a lot of connections in my mind between Christopher Alexander and Jane Jacobs
2015-11-10T16:19:58 <danayo> \xe2\x80\x9cCities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-11-10T16:20:17 <danayo> it\'s a slightly different version, but close
2015-11-10T16:20:31 <simonjb> about what human built space are and who builds them
2015-11-10T16:22:50 <colinclark> These ideas really have to be the starting point for our own articulation of design...
2015-11-10T16:23:04 <colinclark> companies selling products don\'t have any reason to promote this way of thinking
2015-11-10T16:24:01 <danayo> true!
2015-11-10T16:24:05 <colinclark> so when we compare our work to the mainstream--the norm--we\'re going to have to be quite creative and critical about the design methods we encounter
2015-11-10T16:24:51 <colinclark> CUSTOMIZATION CARDS

2015-11-10T16:25:22 <colinclark> OTHER CAPITALIZED NAMES
2015-11-10T16:26:43 * danayo LIKES THIS
2015-11-10T16:27:34 <danayo> do you recommend reading A Pattern Language simonjb?
2015-11-10T16:28:53 <jessm> i\xe2\x80\x99m going to start a campaign for us to consider architects people too!
2015-11-10T16:28:56 <simonjb> danayo: yes, definitely, it\'s a really great book
2015-11-10T16:29:29 <jessm> and i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure i agree that just because someone is selling a product they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reason to consider user-continued or participatory or collaborative design
2015-11-10T16:29:35 <jessm> we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it more and more i\xe2\x80\x99d say
2015-11-10T16:30:05 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-11-10T16:30:25 <colinclark> Yup, often packaged in the rhetoric of someone who wants to sell you something
2015-11-10T16:30:32 <colinclark> be it a product or a sense of expertise
2015-11-10T16:30:49 <colinclark> The latter being what most design consultancies need most to convey
2015-11-10T16:31:02 <colinclark> the point isn\'t that we can\'t learn from mainstream design methods
2015-11-10T16:31:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-11-10T16:31:55 <colinclark> but that the agenda of the people who most often package and deliver ideas about "design thinking" or methodology is different from ours
2015-11-10T16:32:52 <colinclark> and so we should look to uncover alternatives that have been neglected by commercial practice
2015-11-10T16:33:21 <colinclark> and maintain a healthy criticality
2015-11-10T16:33:48 <colinclark> It\'s crucial that we offer users tools, not just processes
2015-11-10T16:33:55 <colinclark> that\'s what I mean when I refer to "material"
2015-11-10T16:36:10 <danayo> colinclark jessm simonjb this is a good and helpful discussion! i have to run to an appnt now :(
2015-11-10T16:36:16 <danayo> sorry to miss standup
2015-11-10T16:36:24 <colinclark> it has been good! see you later, danayo!

2015-11-10T19:14:38 <danayo> jessm colinclark simonjb our discussion earlier also made me think of this project (co-created by Jan & New World Theatre): http://neworldtheatre.com/portfolio-item/me-on-the-map/
2015-11-10T19:34:04 <colinclark> "Cities do indeed design our lives"
2015-11-10T19:34:15 <colinclark> I was just thinking about some funny theory I was reading the other day
2015-11-10T19:34:25 <colinclark> which I won\'t get into in detail because it\'s that goofy critical theory stuff
2015-11-10T19:34:34 <colinclark> but it made a very interesting point
2015-11-10T19:34:59 <colinclark> that it\'s the user interfaces that actually "constitutes" or brings into being the "user"
2015-11-10T19:35:11 <colinclark> I take that to mean that, outside of a design process, we\'re individuals
2015-11-10T19:35:17 <colinclark> citizens, you know, people
2015-11-10T19:35:56 <colinclark> but it\'s via "user-centred design" or "human-computer interaction" that a particular idea of what a user or a human is starts to come out
2015-11-10T19:36:10 <colinclark> in a weird way, this is saying that we\'re being designed by the user interfaces we use
2015-11-10T19:36:33 <colinclark> And we can see this tendency in a lot of our (very useful) design techniques
2015-11-10T19:36:38 <colinclark> like researching user goals
2015-11-10T19:36:40 <colinclark> or creating persons
2015-11-10T19:37:58 * clown joined the channel
2015-11-10T19:37:59 <colinclark> anyway, danayo, this looks like a really awesome project
2015-11-10T19:38:36 <danayo> that\'s really interesting colinclark
2015-11-10T19:38:55 <danayo> it makes me a bit nervous
2015-11-10T19:39:01 <danayo> in that it seems a bit backwards
2015-11-10T19:39:12 <colinclark> Yes
2015-11-10T19:39:19 <colinclark> We have a big responsibility as designers :)
2015-11-10T19:39:35 <colinclark> Reminds me a bit of an Atlantic article that I only had a minute to skim by Ian Bogost
2015-11-10T19:39:52 <colinclark> where he argues that software developers shouldn\'t be allowed to call themselves "engineers"
2015-11-10T19:40:04 <colinclark> since engineers are expected to follow a code of ethics
2015-11-10T19:40:12 <colinclark> and software developers are not
2015-11-10T19:40:20 <colinclark> It was a bit of a romantic idea of an engineer
2015-11-10T19:40:35 <colinclark> but I guess it raised the point that software does have an increasingly huge impact on peoples\' lives
2015-11-10T19:40:59 <colinclark> danayo: Can I ask you a more practical question?
2015-11-10T19:41:53 <danayo> sure colinclark. you were reminding me of the iron ring cermony re: romanticization and ethics
2015-11-10T19:42:31 <danayo> http://www.ironring.ca/background.php
2015-11-10T19:42:40 <danayo> sorry i\'m way off track now :)(
2015-11-10T19:42:46 <danayo> :)
2015-11-10T19:43:54 <colinclark> not at all :)
