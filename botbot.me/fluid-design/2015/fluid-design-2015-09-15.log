2015-09-15T13:41:38 <cindyli> jhung: i noticed a probably styling or div height restriction issue with the infusion doc site: open up http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ and scroll the side bar (table of content) to the bottom, it seems not all items on the sidebar are showing because if i make my browser window bigger, more items will show
2015-09-15T13:44:31 <cindyli> since i\'m working on a laptop, even tho i\'ve maximized out the browser window, still cannot see the section of "migrating to infusion 2.0" ;)
2015-09-15T13:45:10 <colinclark> that would be a great one to fix, yes!
2015-09-15T13:45:41 <jhung> yes cindyli. There\'s a min-height on that container which messes things up if your client is smaller than 44rem.
2015-09-15T13:46:19 <cindyli> ah. ok, is it a known issue, jhung
2015-09-15T13:46:21 <jhung> Of course, this has all been fixed in the new docs platform, but this should be fixed until that merge happens.
2015-09-15T13:46:31 <cindyli> cool. that\'s great
2015-09-15T13:46:56 <cindyli> looking forward to the new docs platform
2015-09-15T13:48:23 <jhung> cindyli: I can create a fix for it now. I will remove the min-height value. But the problem is with pages with little content, the layout will look a bit odd since the height of the sidebar will scale accordinfly.
2015-09-15T13:48:41 <cindyli> ah ha
2015-09-15T13:50:04 <jhung> cindyli: But not seeing the content is an even bigger issue. So I\'ll go ahead with the quick fix. I\'ll submit a pull req. for you in a few minutes.
2015-09-15T13:51:35 <cindyli> jhung: i sort of rmb there\'s a special work flow for merging and making docs pull requests alive? i don\'t know how to do it
2015-09-15T13:52:28 <jhung> cindyli: yes there is and it should be documented in the infusion-docs README. You should give it a try and see if you can follow it. :)
2015-09-15T13:53:00 <cindyli> sounds good. will try

2015-09-15T15:24:13 <jessm> jhung: Tara Robertson visited last week and passed me these slides from a talk she went to at CSUN last year. Can you tell if this is anything new re: Math and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve put into the ILDH?
2015-09-15T15:24:16 <jessm> oops
2015-09-15T15:24:19 <jessm> jhung: http://a11yideas.com/csun/
2015-09-15T15:24:55 <jhung> jessm: I\'ll take a look
2015-09-15T15:25:08 <jessm> cool
2015-09-15T15:26:01 <alanharnum> this was really interesting
2015-09-15T15:27:57 <alanharnum> tara told me screen readers have settled in the last year on using MathML... but they all need slightly different usages of MathML :(
2015-09-15T15:29:14 <jhung> jessm - it\'s inline with what we\'ve presented in the ILDH. We go with the embedded MathML approach with "alt text".
2015-09-15T15:30:08 <jessm> jhung: i thought so, but wanted you to confirm. Tara was saying this group was doing something innovative, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that these slides show it. I will ask her for more info\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-09-15T15:30:26 <jessm> alanharnum: yeah, apparently weird inconsistencies all around
2015-09-15T15:51:22 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-09-15T16:02:55 <colinclark> Sina\'s a pretty smart guy, and a screen reader user himself
2015-09-15T16:03:07 <colinclark> so I think he\'s probably got a great view on what works and doesn\'t work currently
2015-09-15T16:03:48 <colinclark> And David\'s a Canadian and old friend of the ATRC
2015-09-15T16:03:56 <colinclark> also very experienced
2015-09-15T16:04:12 <colinclark> it\'s interesting that the advice boils down to "use MathJax," more or less
2015-09-15T16:05:15 <colinclark> jhung, jessm: I think we should cite these slides in our section in the ILDH
2015-09-15T16:05:39 <colinclark> since they provide some very useful pragmatics, specifically about the role of MathPlayer and MathJax
2015-09-15T16:10:05 <jhung> colinclark: good idea. Right now Math is framed in context of building an EPUB, but I think it\'s a good topic to surface elsewhere in the ILDH too.
2015-09-15T16:17:10 <alanharnum> colinclark: one of the things Tara told me is that Latex is strong in the DNA of academic math publishing
2015-09-15T16:17:37 <alanharnum> so it doesn\'t surprise me that a practical piece of advice is "use MathJax", since it will deal with Latex-style math notation
2015-09-15T16:17:51 <colinclark> yep
2015-09-15T16:18:13 <colinclark> but my impression is that MathJax is also essentially required for reliably rendering MathML across browsers
2015-09-15T16:18:50 <alanharnum> yeah
2015-09-15T16:18:52 <colinclark> and it obviously has API hooks for MathPlayer, which I guess we can think of as a giant workaround for a) unreliable MathML rendering support in browsers and b) sketchy AT support for MathML
2015-09-15T16:19:20 <alanharnum> it basically sounds like a shim approach
2015-09-15T16:19:32 <colinclark> in particular because Chrome simply dropped MathML support at some point
2015-09-15T16:19:34 <colinclark> so they render to SVG
2015-09-15T16:19:36 <colinclark> alanharnum: yep
2015-09-15T16:19:48 <colinclark> docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/output.html
2015-09-15T16:21:27 <colinclark> jhung: It\'s interesting, it looks like some EPUB3 readers have built-in MathML support, while others need to use MathJax to render it properly http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/misc/epub.html
2015-09-15T16:21:51 <colinclark> Looks like Safari actually added native MathML support in version 8, which is also interesting. My impression in the past was that this was slipping, not increasing

2015-09-15T17:44:21 <jhung> cindyli1: I took a look at the sidebar for infusion docs- I was mistaken that it was a quick fix. There\'s clearly more going on there than I expected.
2015-09-15T17:45:18 <cindyli1> jhung: no worries, take ur time. or if there\'s a plan to roll out the new docs platform soon, we probably can ignore this bug?
2015-09-15T17:46:51 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2015-09-15T17:47:11 <jhung> That\'s something we\'ll need to figure our cindyli. Perhaps next Floe meeting we can start talking about it.
2015-09-15T17:47:27 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2015-09-15T17:47:41 <jhung> I have a jira for it just in case cindyli
2015-09-15T17:49:43 <cindyli> awesome, can you add that jira to the iteration plan, jhung. it will remind us this thing to talk about in the next floe meeting :)
2015-09-15T17:49:53 <jhung> ok cindyli
2015-09-15T17:49:58 <cindyli> thanks, jhung
