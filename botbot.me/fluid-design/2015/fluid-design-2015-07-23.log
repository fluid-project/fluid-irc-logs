2015-07-23T20:27:20 <Jess_> sepideh: so, i made one small change in the beginning of the doc
2015-07-23T20:27:24 <Jess_> sepideh: The end of this document will articulate what the SP1 team will do next, what design artefacts will be delivered in the next iteration of this document deliverable.
2015-07-23T20:27:34 <Jess_> i just slimmed out the other notes, FYI
2015-07-23T20:28:06 <sepideh> great. Jess_  what should I do with the document when it\xe2\x80\x99s ready tomorrow afternoon?
2015-07-23T20:28:41 <Jess_> can you send it off to Matthias and let him know it\xe2\x80\x99s ready for the internal review \xe2\x80\x94 Till and Gianna are our reviewers. i can get you all of their emails if you want
2015-07-23T20:28:46 <Jess_> cc me and colin
2015-07-23T20:30:05 <sepideh> For sure. I think I have their emails. I may share it with danayo prior to sending off for a last quick scan to make sure we have covered everything and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it out.
2015-07-23T20:30:18 <sepideh> if she is available
2015-07-23T20:32:53 <Jess_> +1
2015-07-23T20:40:07 <danayo> sounds good sepideh
2015-07-23T20:40:29 <sepideh> awesome! thanks danayo
2015-07-23T20:45:37 <sepideh> one big question Jess_ should I replace User Model with Use Model across the document?
2015-07-23T20:45:49 <sepideh> as Gregg suggested yesterday
2015-07-23T20:47:22 <Jess_> sepideh: i think you should, yes
2015-07-23T20:47:48 <sepideh> I\xe2\x80\x99ll do.
