b'2015-11-06T21:29:57 <sepidehshahi> let\xe2\x80\x99s also add that to the items we can check with the team
2015-11-06T21:30:05 <sepidehshahi> agreed:)
2015-11-06T21:30:24 <alanharnum> it\'s important for accessibility to have an alternative representation of the infographic - that\'s typically just a data table
2015-11-06T21:30:34 <alanharnum> so atm the legend is kind of a combined legend / data table
2015-11-06T21:31:56 <alanharnum> there are some things we can do to hide the total values visually while still making them accessible to screen readers, but that only handles one barrier - it doesn\'t help someone with a cognitive disability who might prefer a table, etc
2015-11-06T21:32:30 <alanharnum> in this context it may be ok because the authoring interface is also functioning as a kind of data table
2015-11-06T21:32:52 <alanharnum> so maybe this is more a question for the envisioned "export" version? not sure
2015-11-06T21:36:23 <sepidehshahi> All your points are absolutely valid. having the option to hide/show them for the authors is the best solution. So, depending on the context of use, they can adjust the exported chart. let\xe2\x80\x99s say in an exam where the teacher wants the student to calculate the values, then the values are not exported\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-06T21:37:35 <alanharnum> yeah that makes sense
2015-11-06T21:37:42 <alanharnum> all these things should eventually be configurable

2015-11-06T15:45:07 <alanharnum> thank you!
2015-11-06T15:45:18 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: I\xe2\x80\x99m making some changes on that screenshot. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it to you before the standup

2015-11-06T16:24:55 <alanharnum> (work in progress)
2015-11-06T16:28:10 <sepidehshahi> great! i just sent you the screenshots alanharnum
2015-11-06T16:28:18 <alanharnum> thanks!
2015-11-06T16:28:42 <alanharnum> unsurprisingly with even minimal tweaks to get it closer to the design i think it looks loads better :P
2015-11-06T16:28:51 <sepidehshahi> you have lready fixed most of my coments;)

2015-11-06T21:08:57 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: I just noticed something. If the second value is larger than the first value, the legend automatically reorders the labels and puts the larger value as the first item, the chart also reorders the sections from large to small. so the legend is not aligned with the value table.
2015-11-06T21:09:37 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: yes - that\'s configurable, though
2015-11-06T21:09:44 <alanharnum> if we\'d prefer to turn off the sorting for the demo, we can do so
2015-11-06T21:10:24 <sepidehshahi> awesome! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know we should discuss that with the team and what everyone thinks is a better interaction. Thanks
2015-11-06T21:10:29 <alanharnum> we have it on by default because that\'s typical pie chart behaviour
2015-11-06T21:10:47 <alanharnum> which is slices / legend in value order from highest to lowest
2015-11-06T21:12:01 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s seems very rational. Just the way the rows in legend don\xe2\x80\x99t match the rows in the table is a bit confusing.
2015-11-06T21:12:20 <alanharnum> yeah i can see that
2015-11-06T21:12:28 <alanharnum> not sure what the best approach is
2015-11-06T21:12:34 <sepidehshahi> but let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss it with others on Monday:)
2015-11-06T21:12:39 <sepidehshahi> me neither
2015-11-06T21:12:39 <alanharnum> probable "user configurable" is the answer :)
2015-11-06T21:12:48 <sepidehshahi> yeah;)
2015-11-06T21:12:55 <alanharnum> which is why it\'s an option in the back-end code, though not currently exposed in the UI
2015-11-06T21:26:01 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: https://rawgit.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/FLOE-433/demos/index.html
2015-11-06T21:26:07 <alanharnum> slices now displaying percentages
2015-11-06T21:26:40 <alanharnum> i went a step further and made it so that you can define a simple template when placing the chart on a page
2015-11-06T21:26:59 <sepidehshahi> Great job alanharnum!
2015-11-06T21:27:03 <alanharnum> so you can do some basic display formatting using the percentage/raw value/total value, depending on how you want the slices to look
2015-11-06T21:27:20 <alanharnum> i\'m implementing something similar for the legend
2015-11-06T21:27:51 <alanharnum> based on what Justin_o did for the data entry panel, which already had a bunch of percentage display & calculation code i can reuse
2015-11-06T21:29:17 <sepidehshahi> perfect! just one thing, I think we only need to show the labels on the legend. so the legend would be just the color and the label.
2015-11-06T21:29:53 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: that\'s one point i think we should discuss Monday...
