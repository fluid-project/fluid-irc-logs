2015-10-07T16:28:51 <sepidehshahi> danayo alanharnum and simonjb, what colinclark mentioned about building a quick rapid prototyping framework for audio reminded me of this project, which I think helps designers who are very visual to experiment with non visual elements such as sound and light: http://www.fastcodesign.com/3043132/meet-henri-a-box-for-designing-the-screenless-interfaces-of-tomorrow
2015-10-07T16:29:42 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: that's really cool
2015-10-07T16:33:56 <jhung> anastasiac - I came across Atlassian's doc site yesterday. It's rather nice. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository
2015-10-07T16:34:16 <anastasiac> yes, very nice

2015-10-07T16:36:29 <jhung> oh and regarding styling of colours anastasiac. I'm curious to hear what you found challenging. I have an approach but I didn't share that because I wanted to see what you would do. :)
2015-10-07T16:37:44 <anastasiac> well, jhung, for one: I wanted to change the background colour of the header, but that colour is specified in a whole bunch of places!! I had to try to find all of the places so that I could change them all.
2015-10-07T16:37:58 <anastasiac> also, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear how to change the colours in my own css file instead of editing the original one
2015-10-07T16:38:06 <jhung> ah. :)
2015-10-07T16:38:15 <jhung> Yes there's an easy approach to this anastasiac.
2015-10-07T16:38:30 <jhung> It's good you ran into this because this is the sort of stuff that should do into the documentation.
2015-10-07T16:39:13 <jhung> anastasiac: take a look at how I did it here for the ILDH https://github.com/jhung/docs-inclusive-learning/tree/master/src/documents/css
2015-10-07T16:42:07 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll use that as a model, jhung. But I notice that you still have to specify the same colour several time, e.g. to change the header background colour, you actually have to enter the new hex code four times\xe2\x80\xa6 Could you create a variable called \xe2\x80\x9cdark-blue\xe2\x80\x9d and just use that four times?
2015-10-07T16:43:15 <jhung> anastasiac: yes. you can. That's up to the implementer to do that. I left those constants out so it's clear that everything is customizable.
2015-10-07T16:44:00 <jhung> It made sense to me at the time, but in practice it may be more of an inconvenience.

2015-10-07T16:47:38 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it in my customizations, jhung
2015-10-07T16:48:20 <jhung> anastasiac: great. Let me know how it goes.

2015-10-07T17:42:09 <anastasiac> jhung, in the .styl files, what\xe2\x80\x99s the diff between = and ?=
2015-10-07T17:42:52 <jhung> ?= is a conditional assignment. If it isn't defined, then give it a value.
2015-10-07T17:42:58 <jhung> ^anastasiac
2015-10-07T17:43:23 <anastasiac> and if it is already assigned, then ?= will be ignored, jhung?
2015-10-07T17:43:31 <jhung> yes anastasiac
2015-10-07T17:43:39 <anastasiac> ok, thanks

2015-10-07T19:02:36 <anastasiac> jhung, what do I have to edit to make sure the \xe2\x80\x9cedit on github\xe2\x80\x9d link in the docs sites doesn\xe2\x80\x99t point to the docs-template repo?
2015-10-07T19:03:10 <jhung> ooh. good question anastasiac.
2015-10-07T19:03:31 <jhung> There's a handlebars helper function in docs-core that does that
2015-10-07T19:03:38 <jhung> let me check anastasiac
2015-10-07T19:11:14 <jhung> ah. good catch anastasiac. docpad.js defines the github root. I would prefer an automated way of making those URLs that doesn't need a hard-coded url.
2015-10-07T19:12:09 <anastasiac> ah, ok, at least now I know where it is :-)
2015-10-07T19:12:52 * michelled joined the channel
2015-10-07T19:13:55 <jhung> I'll file a jira for that anastasiac to make sure it at least goes into the readme.
