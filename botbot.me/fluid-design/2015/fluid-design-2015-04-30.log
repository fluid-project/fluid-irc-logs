2015-04-30T14:09:35 <jessm> notably missing, IMHO, is the Whalers logo: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/Hartford_Whalers_Logo-79-92.svg/1031px-Hartford_Whalers_Logo-79-92.svg.png
2015-04-30T14:16:13 <jessm> also, some very important cat research about why they love boxes: http://www.wired.com/2015/02/whats-up-with-cats-and-boxes?mbid=social_twitter
