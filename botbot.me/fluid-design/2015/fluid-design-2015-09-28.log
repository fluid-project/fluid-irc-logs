2015-09-28T17:32:17 <anastasiac> say, jhung, I wonder if some time this week, when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a break from the ILDH, you could turn your creative juices to a small design issue in my Prefs Framework tutorial :-)
2015-09-28T17:32:58 <jhung> anastasiac: sure. What can I help with?
2015-09-28T17:33:54 <anastasiac> In the tutorial, I\xe2\x80\x99m using something my head keeps referring to as \xe2\x80\x9ccallout boxes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 rectangles of text off to the right, containing some text that expounds on something in the main narrative but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit right in with the narrative
2015-09-28T17:34:06 <anastasiac> you can see them on this page: http://acheetham.github.io/infusion-docs/infusion/development/tutorial-PreferencesFramework/PrefsFramework.html starting about a quarter of the way down
2015-09-28T17:34:43 <anastasiac> I welcome any suggestions for the stylign of the actual box, jhung, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is how to actually associate the box with the phrase in the main narrative that triggered it
2015-09-28T17:35:18 <anastasiac> i.e. what can I do to the phrase in the narrative to let the reader know that the nearby callout box relates to this particular phrase
2015-09-28T17:35:42 <jhung> anastasiac: Sure I\'ll take a look.
2015-09-28T17:36:10 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-09-28T17:36:21 <anastasiac> jhung, for example, the third box talks about models, but it\xe2\x80\x99s beside the paragraph on panels. The word model occurs (for the first time) in that paragraph, but at first glance, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear why that model discussion is there
2015-09-28T17:37:15 <anastasiac> jhung, it\xe2\x80\x99s not urgent; I\xe2\x80\x99m still working on this markdown port
2015-09-28T17:37:21 <anastasiac> but if you find yourself looking for a diversion...
2015-09-28T17:37:29 <anastasiac> :-)

2015-09-28T18:12:00 <jhung> anastasiac: I took a look at what you have regarding the "call-outs". I have a few thoughts.
2015-09-28T18:12:21 <anastasiac> excellent, jhung
2015-09-28T18:13:03 <jhung> 1. Semantically, we\'d want to use an <aside> or <details> element here.
2015-09-28T18:14:15 <anastasiac> right
2015-09-28T18:14:17 <jhung> 2. I was thinking that visually we can use a little icon to indicate that content in the main area has an aside. In text books, sometimes they use little (!) icons etc to visually associate the two.
2015-09-28T18:15:48 <anastasiac> jhung, the icon would appear attached to the text in the narrative, like a footnote number?
2015-09-28T18:16:24 <jhung> That\'s one possible solution anastasiac.
2015-09-28T18:16:35 <anastasiac> is that what you were thinking?
2015-09-28T18:16:52 <jhung> This raises another question - how would such a relationship be communicated to a screen reader?
2015-09-28T18:17:19 <anastasiac> good question\xe2\x80\xa6 hm...
2015-09-28T18:17:57 <anastasiac> this might help me, jhung: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_HTML5_aside_element
2015-09-28T18:18:49 <jhung> found this too anastasiac: https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/02/using-wai-aria-landmarks-2013/
2015-09-28T18:19:37 <jhung> yeah. role="complementary
2015-09-28T18:19:52 <anastasiac> but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help with the association...
2015-09-28T18:20:04 <jhung> but I wonder how the aside should be "contained" so that it\'s clear the aside is associated with a bit of content.
2015-09-28T18:20:31 <jhung> Maybe use a <section><p>\xe2\x80\xa6</p><aside></aside></section> ?
2015-09-28T18:20:49 <anastasiac> maybe aria-describedby, or something?
2015-09-28T18:21:52 <anastasiac> maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll pick joseph\xe2\x80\x99s brain for aria ideas over coffee tomorrow morning\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-09-28T18:22:44 <jhung> sounds good anastasiac. Heidi is another good person to ask.
2015-09-28T18:22:55 <anastasiac> right, good idea
