2015-08-11T17:33:20 <murilocrivellari> danayo: absolutely! just a sec
2015-08-11T17:33:24 <danayo> thanks

2015-08-11T18:54:30 <danayo> murilocrivellari: the designs are looking great. one question about tab location 4 - "click enter and use arrows to navigate" - will user be able to navigate through the chart sections here? is that the idea? if so do you have a breakdown of that nav order? (with and without chart entries)
2015-08-11T19:05:37 <murilocrivellari> danayo: the user won\'t be able to go through the chart sections in this first version. Using arrows will allow navigation through the labels, so they can be read by a screen reader. But for future versions I believe we should include that feature
2015-08-11T19:07:02 <murilocrivellari> I believe that if the user tabs to the chart itself, they should hear something like "empty chart"
2015-08-11T19:11:21 <danayo> ok, thanks murilocrivellari - do you mean the legend labels?

2015-08-11T19:15:40 <murilocrivellari> danayo: yes, that\'s what I meant. However, there are yet some missing links with the chart display and the audio player because we were not completely sure on what would be delivered...
2015-08-11T19:16:33 <murilocrivellari> once we figure that out I must be able to sketch the tab order again with more details :)
2015-08-11T19:17:20 <danayo> sounds good murilocrivellari - maybe the label could just be a bit more descriptive, like "select enter and use the arrow keys to navigate the chart area" or something
2015-08-11T19:18:24 <murilocrivellari> absolutely danayo. I\'ll change that. Thanks for your comments
