2015-12-18T16:45:20 <colinclark> What\'s the topic of the HCII abstract you mentioned at standup today, Jess_?

2015-12-18T16:46:44 <Jess_> colinclark: inclusive design process and how it was used in different settings like MTO, sprints, design work
2015-12-18T16:47:28 <colinclark> ah, great
2015-12-18T16:48:04 <colinclark> Do you have particular "design work" you\'re planning to use as a case study?
2015-12-18T16:48:55 <Jess_> colinclark: international collaborative projects is i think what i\xe2\x80\x99ve got it listed as in the abstract \xe2\x80\x94 meaning C4A or P4A
2015-12-18T16:49:32 <colinclark> Great
2015-12-18T16:49:36 <colinclark> looking forward to seeing it
2015-12-18T16:50:58 <colinclark> Hey jhung1, I was interested in your standup update about localizing descriptive text in the PhET sims
2015-12-18T16:51:13 <colinclark> I wasn\'t sure I fully understood the issue related to string templating and the challenges of localization
2015-12-18T16:51:21 <colinclark> can you elaborate a bit?
2015-12-18T16:56:51 <jhung1> sure colinclark.
2015-12-18T16:56:54 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2015-12-18T16:58:10 <jhung> We have a description of the sim that gets updated as a result of user actions. The description includes information about what state the sim was in before, and where it is now.
2015-12-18T16:59:00 <jhung> For example: if the arm has moved closer to the doorknob, we would say something like: "The hand was further away, but is now closest to the doorknob."
2015-12-18T16:59:35 * clown has quit
2015-12-18T16:59:47 <jhung> I\'ve built tables of possible descriptions for different events and documented them here colinclark https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Simulation+Design
2015-12-18T17:00:16 <colinclark> yup, I remember these
2015-12-18T17:00:18 <colinclark> they\'re great
2015-12-18T17:00:46 <jhung> The issue that Justin_o and I were talking about was the challenge of translating the strings, especially if the grammar structure is very different.
2015-12-18T17:01:46 <jhung> I would love to keep the more descriptive strings if possible, but aware of the need to make it easy to i8nize.
2015-12-18T17:01:47 <colinclark> yeah, this is the point I\'m trying to understand better
2015-12-18T17:01:53 <colinclark> what makes them hard to localize?
2015-12-18T17:02:50 <jhung> The best example currently is in the Charge Description table. In the line "Small change in the quantity of charges after a discharge occurred"
2015-12-18T17:03:05 <jhung> there are a lot of nuances to the language.
2015-12-18T17:03:40 <jhung> So if we template for English for example, it may be different for Chinese.
2015-12-18T17:04:12 <jhung> So the Chinese translator would have to define their own template and values.
2015-12-18T17:05:30 <jhung> It\'ll be extra work, but perhaps that\'s acceptable given what we\'re trying to accomplish?
2015-12-18T17:05:48 <colinclark> but presumably the templates will change, too, right?
2015-12-18T17:06:05 <colinclark> Since everything that\'s in a human language will have to be localized
2015-12-18T17:06:20 <jhung> yes.
2015-12-18T17:09:35 <jhung> The next challenge would be to come up with a method to build these strings from custom templates.
2015-12-18T17:10:10 <jhung> We haven\'t given this much thought as of yet.
2015-12-18T17:10:17 <jhung> Open to ideas.
2015-12-18T17:14:24 <colinclark> Does PhET have a particular scheme they use for localization, jhung?
2015-12-18T17:14:29 <colinclark> Have you looked into that?
2015-12-18T17:14:56 <colinclark> I\'m curious about what your more "simplified" strings will be like, jhung
2015-12-18T17:15:39 <jhung> I\'ll ask them about that colinclark. They may already have something.
2015-12-18T17:15:44 <colinclark> but given that every string is ultimately going to be translated, I think that maybe the issue isn\'t as bad as you think
2015-12-18T17:15:47 <colinclark> unless I\'m missing something
2015-12-18T17:15:59 <colinclark> since one would translate both the individual strings and the templates as well
2015-12-18T17:16:15 <jhung> As for the simplified string - I\'m curious as to what they\'ll look like too. I\'ve only just started exploring that.
2015-12-18T17:16:39 <colinclark> and that\'s probably unavoidable (and not necessarily a bad thing) if you\'re speaking a "humane" language to the user
2015-12-18T17:17:02 <colinclark> Justin_o: What was your impression about the issue? ^
2015-12-18T17:17:42 <jhung> Justin_o may have gone offline colinclark. He was scheduled for 1/2 day today.
2015-12-18T17:17:50 <colinclark> aha
2015-12-18T17:17:54 <colinclark> he looked like he was still here :)
2015-12-18T17:18:16 <jhung> He\'s here in spirit.
2015-12-18T17:18:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: i just came back for the PGA demo
2015-12-18T17:18:24 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-12-18T17:18:38 <Justin_o> colinclark, jhung: i\'ll try to catch up in a couple minutes
2015-12-18T17:18:43 <colinclark> no worries, Justin_o
2015-12-18T17:20:46 * cindyli1 has quit
2015-12-18T17:25:33 * clown joined the channel
2015-12-18T17:29:23 <Justin_o> colinclark, jhung: back.. i think i\'m caught up now
2015-12-18T17:29:36 <colinclark> cool
2015-12-18T17:30:37 <Justin_o> so the issue was more about having variability in the text, that are human language.. this is hard to describe
2015-12-18T17:31:13 <Justin_o> but basically there are variations to make it properly grammatical in english that to accommodate the variation in values that get dropped in
2015-12-18T17:31:59 <Justin_o> so the worry is that the template is has tokens that are just there to satisfy the english grammar as opposed to having tokens just for values
2015-12-18T17:32:06 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-12-18T17:32:30 <Justin_o> colinclark, jhung.. did that make sense?
2015-12-18T17:32:45 <colinclark> sort of
2015-12-18T17:34:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: :) okay.. let me know if there\'s a part i should explain more
2015-12-18T17:34:49 <Justin_o> at any rate, we were talking about simplifying the sentences a bit so there is less variability and also have more string templates as opposed to more tokens within  a string template.
2015-12-18T17:35:11 <Justin_o> also Jesse did mention that there is a means for localization, but i\'m not sure how that works in PhET
2015-12-18T17:35:19 <colinclark> cool
2015-12-18T17:35:25 * anastasiac has quit
2015-12-18T17:35:27 <colinclark> I imagine these sorts of things are generally similar
2015-12-18T17:36:05 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-12-18T17:38:10 <colinclark> Justin_o: I guess perhaps you can elaborate on the concern in this: "the template has tokens that are just there to satisfy the english grammar as opposed to having tokens just for values"
2015-12-18T17:40:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: so in terms of charts that jhung provided in that linked wiki page
2015-12-18T17:40:53 <Justin_o> it\'s the variation across columns i guess
2015-12-18T17:41:13 <Justin_o> is the best way to describe
2015-12-18T17:41:32 <Justin_o> but possibly by treating every row as a template it might be okay
2015-12-18T17:43:04 <colinclark> I was just going to say...
2015-12-18T17:43:07 <colinclark> maybe this is what you\'re saying
2015-12-18T17:43:19 <colinclark> that maybe you\'ll have a less fine-grained approach to templating
2015-12-18T17:43:28 <colinclark> with more "sentence strings"
2015-12-18T17:43:42 <colinclark> instead of imaging that you can compose a sentence from a large number of individual tokens
2015-12-18T17:43:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, exactly
2015-12-18T17:45:21 <jhung> colinclark: that approach sounds fine to me. There aren\'t *that* many strings to translate. The only variability will be in the quantities and the description of locations.
2015-12-18T17:54:20 <colinclark> yup
