2015-12-07T16:52:21 <michelled1> danayo: is there any work that\'s currently happening related to chart authoring or sonification?
2015-12-07T16:56:41 <danayo> not on my end right now michelled
2015-12-07T16:56:52 * jessm has quit
2015-12-07T16:57:49 <michelled1> danayo: can you check the design links under Pie Chart Sonification and make sure they are the correct ones? Please remove any that are no longer relevant to what we want to build https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2015-12-07T17:01:16 <danayo> sure michelled will do

2015-12-07T17:24:31 <danayo> sepidehshahi, colinclark and everyone: I think jon was planning to go through some of the phet work in the crit today but he\'s not around - I don\'t have anything to discuss, does anyone else? Justin_o do you want to talk through some of the phet stuff?
2015-12-07T17:24:56 <colinclark> I don\'t have anything in particuar, danayo
2015-12-07T17:25:17 <colinclark> if no one has STUFF today, we can skip the crits, too
2015-12-07T17:25:21 <sepidehshahi> danayo: this week I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to share. Maybe next week I could share some of the SP1 diagrams to get feedback
2015-12-07T17:25:27 <Justin_o> danayo: I believe Taliesin will be joining today and would probably have some of her PhET related work to talk about
2015-12-07T17:25:50 <Justin_o> colinclark, sepidehshahi ^
2015-12-07T17:26:03 <sepidehshahi> sounds good Justin_o
2015-12-07T17:26:23 <michelled1> colinclark, danayo: I think we never finished scoping our next goal for chart authoring
2015-12-07T17:26:30 <colinclark> no, we didn\'t
2015-12-07T17:26:38 <colinclark> we left ourselves to contemplate our next move :)
2015-12-07T17:26:43 <colinclark> I was thinking about it today
2015-12-07T17:26:50 <michelled1> I know alanharnum has been heads down with ops work
2015-12-07T17:26:51 <colinclark> still wondering what option seemed coolest
2015-12-07T17:26:58 <colinclark> yes, sounds like he will be for a bit still
2015-12-07T17:27:12 <colinclark> I had a new user send an email to the Flocking list who was doing some similar kinds of sonification
2015-12-07T17:27:16 <colinclark> I think he was sonifying network data
2015-12-07T17:27:20 <michelled1> neat
2015-12-07T17:27:28 <colinclark> but there\'s definitely interest in having a higher-level toolkit for transforming data into sounds
2015-12-07T17:27:46 <colinclark> I know that Bruce Walker has a sonification lab application
2015-12-07T17:28:01 <colinclark> designed, I think, to give a graphical way to define mappings between data and sound
2015-12-07T17:28:19 <colinclark> at some point we were talking and I think he was interested in the prospect of working on it with him
2015-12-07T17:28:24 <colinclark> since it\'s old and written in Java
2015-12-07T17:30:59 <danayo> michelled1 were you suggesting we use some of the crit time to discuss our next moves for sonification? seems like a fine idea to me.
2015-12-07T17:32:55 <michelled1> no, danayo it was just on my mind :)
2015-12-07T17:33:02 <michelled1> but we can - if you\'d like
2015-12-07T17:33:21 <michelled1> my understanding of the crits was that they are more open ended and design focussed
2015-12-07T17:33:41 <michelled1> planning and scoping seems like a different activity
2015-12-07T17:33:53 <danayo> true michelled1, maybe we should wait on it then.
2015-12-07T17:38:26 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I think this is the most recent "non-interactive" version of the chart authoring mockups, is that right? https://www.dropbox.com/s/7snkhg7o5g29pzl/CA%20Tool%20%5BVersion%203%5D.ai?dl=0
2015-12-07T17:38:47 <danayo> and are you able to open that file in AI?
2015-12-07T17:39:31 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right danayo.
2015-12-07T17:40:33 <sepidehshahi> I can open it but since it is created with a newer version, it has some problems
2015-12-07T17:41:21 <sepidehshahi> like all those clipping masks. and I\xe2\x80\x99m able to open one page at a time
2015-12-07T17:41:26 <sepidehshahi> do you need that file?
2015-12-07T17:41:39 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2015-12-07T17:41:57 <danayo> no, not right now sepidehshahi
2015-12-07T17:42:57 <sepidehshahi> Let me know when you needed it, I can recreate it compatible with our CS version
2015-12-07T17:43:24 <danayo> actually, sepidehshahi - I was hoping to put a link on the wiki to a pdf
2015-12-07T17:43:37 <danayo> but since I can\'t open it in AI, I can\'t create a pdf
2015-12-07T17:43:48 <danayo> unless, I suppose, I do it page by page
2015-12-07T17:44:34 <danayo> is that what you were planning on doing? opening it one page at a time? might be easier to contact murillo and ask him to save it in a different version
2015-12-07T17:44:38 <sepidehshahi> is there a PDF version of it already on the wiki? on the floe iteration page? Murilo put PDFs in there on weekly basis
2015-12-07T17:44:41 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2015-12-07T17:44:56 <danayo> ah
2015-12-07T17:45:40 <sepidehshahi> let me saerch for it
2015-12-07T17:45:41 <danayo> I don\'t see a link or an attachment sepidehshahi
2015-12-07T17:46:31 <danayo> and I don\'t see a pdf version of that particular file in dropbox either sepidehshahi
2015-12-07T17:47:59 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I think this is actually the lastest version: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1jazkhvjulpz7zt/CA%20Tool%20%5BFlow%5D.pdf?dl=0
2015-12-07T17:48:23 <sepidehshahi> the only thing that we changed after that was removing the rest button

2015-12-07T17:50:28 <danayo> ok, thanks sepidehshahi - where is that file stored? I don\'t see it in the same folder
2015-12-07T17:51:37 <sepidehshahi> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I just checked the floe iteration page history and found the link in there. It might have been on Murilo\xe2\x80\x99s computer
2015-12-07T17:53:30 <danayo> ok, thanks sepidehshahi
