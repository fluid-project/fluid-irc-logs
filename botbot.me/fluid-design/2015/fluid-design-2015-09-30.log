2015-09-30T14:47:47 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking into your suggestion yesterday about using an exclamation mark icon to indicate the callouts. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at the icon font tutorial, but I\xe2\x80\x99m getting lost at the SVG part. I have no experience with SVG. If the docs already have an icon font, I probably just want to add another icon to that, right? Do I add an exclamation mark to the existing SVG file? Or does each icon need its own SVG file, and icomoon
2015-09-30T14:47:48 <anastasiac> combines them?
2015-09-30T14:52:20 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-09-30T14:53:49 <jhung> anastasiac: each icon needs their own svg. However, icomoon comes with a few royalty free icons we can use. Perhaps look at those first?
2015-09-30T14:54:06 <anastasiac> oh, good to know, jhung, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check
2015-09-30T14:54:17 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-09-30T14:54:18 <jhung> In a pinch you can look for a Unicode character which may serve our purposes.

2015-09-30T16:28:07 <anastasiac> jhung: any feedback on my treatment of callouts? http://acheetham.github.io/infusion-docs/infusion/development/tutorial-PreferencesFramework/PrefsFramework.html
2015-09-30T16:31:28 <jhung> anastasiac: looking good! I wonder if the icons should be oriented the same way instead of being mirrors of one another.
2015-09-30T16:32:09 <jhung> Also the smaller icon with green on grey is a bit hard to interpret. Maybe make it a little bigger and/or choose a darker colour?
2015-09-30T16:32:20 <anastasiac> jhung: not sure. I was orienting them so that they \xe2\x80\x9cpointed at\xe2\x80\x9d the text...
2015-09-30T16:37:25 <jhung> anastasiac: it\'s interesting because we\'re matching the text from the article to the call-out, but the icon is slightly different. It\'s not a huge mental leap though. I could live with it.
2015-09-30T16:37:35 <jhung> I wonder what other people think?

2015-09-30T16:38:09 <jhung> Any thought how these call-outs / asides will look on mobile anastasiac?
2015-09-30T16:38:44 <anastasiac> oy, not yet, jhung \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0thanks for reminding me. Any suggestions for how to treat them?
2015-09-30T16:40:48 <jhung> anastasiac: My instinct is to "serialize" it and put the asides after the next closing </p>, but we would have to make the relationship between the pin pairs clear.

2015-09-30T18:35:10 <taliesin> hi folks, is there a C4A workshop happening virtually?
2015-09-30T18:35:15 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-09-30T18:36:16 <taliesin> I mean, is it happening in vidyo? And  if so, which room?
2015-09-30T18:36:37 * simonjb has quit
2015-09-30T18:37:52 <jessm> taliesin: i think that message was about a conference called community for all
2015-09-30T18:38:01 <jessm> and it was on-site at Syracuse University last week
2015-09-30T18:38:03 <jessm> not online
2015-09-30T18:38:17 <taliesin> yes :-) and thank you :-)
2015-09-30T18:38:52 <jessm> taliesin: no problem! and glad to see you here
2015-09-30T18:39:43 <taliesin> I am confused. The community meeting for today was canceled because fo the C4A, so I though it was concurrent.
2015-09-30T18:40:02 <taliesin> or in replace of today\xe2\x80\x99s community meeting.
2015-09-30T18:43:32 <taliesin> So, the next Community  Workshop is the 7th and it is on a11y Assessment.
2015-09-30T18:46:21 <taliesin> @danayo - nice list of resources gathered on the wiki.

2015-09-30T19:15:47 <danayo> Too many C4As!
2015-09-30T19:27:46 <taliesin> danayo thanks for the clarification.
