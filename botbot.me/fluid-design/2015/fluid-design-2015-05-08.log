2015-05-08T17:57:22 <michelled> colinclark, Jess_: do you know what days she is working tomorrow?
2015-05-08T17:57:31 <michelled> ha, I mean next week ;)
2015-05-08T17:57:36 <colinclark> Only one day
2015-05-08T17:57:42 <colinclark> and she didn't actually tell me which one--she needed to figure it out
2015-05-08T17:57:51 <colinclark> it won't be Monday, I know that
2015-05-08T17:58:09 <michelled> sepideh: I guess we can wait to hear from her and then schedule the design brainstorm
2015-05-08T17:58:26 <sepideh> sure
2015-05-08T17:58:57 <Jess_> colinclark: she sent an email...
2015-05-08T17:59:18 <colinclark> oh yes
2015-05-08T17:59:19 <Jess_> next week she\xe2\x80\x99ll work wed and thur
2015-05-08T17:59:26 <Jess_> sepideh: michelled: ^
2015-05-08T17:59:41 <Jess_> so, taking Mon and Tues off next week and the next monday too
2015-05-08T18:00:27 <michelled> I guess we can do Wednesday before the community meeting - what do you all think?
2015-05-08T18:00:37 <sepideh> that works for me
2015-05-08T18:02:04 <michelled> colinclark, Jess_ : does that work for you too? ^'
2015-05-08T18:02:24 <colinclark> lemme check
2015-05-08T18:02:31 <colinclark> what are we doing?
2015-05-08T18:02:46 <colinclark> Looks like I'm free then
2015-05-08T18:03:27 <michelled> it's for the meeting Sepi proposed on list - P4A Design Kit persona conversation
2015-05-08T18:03:27 <sepideh> we are gonna pick the final set of personae for P41 and I can start working on usecases
2015-05-08T18:05:44 <sepideh> so far we have almost 25 persona, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we need all of them for the Design Kit and also we have to make sure we are not missing any user group. Those are the things I need to get your feedback for.
2015-05-08T18:10:43 <colinclark> cool
2015-05-08T18:10:48 <colinclark> ok
2015-05-08T18:10:56 <colinclark> i'm so behind on email :)
2015-05-08T18:11:39 <Jess_> wednesday works for me
2015-05-08T18:18:53 <sepideh> So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reschedule for Wednesday at 1:30. thank you all :)
