2015-09-21T16:02:41 <danayo> jhung your wireframes describing accessibility of a simulation sound great! look forward to seeing them
2015-09-21T16:04:23 <jhung> danayo: I will need to pick your brain about it later today. Are you going to be around in the afternoon?
2015-09-21T16:04:40 <danayo> yes! sounds good

2015-09-21T17:28:44 <colinclark> danayo: http://hcs.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/hcs/article/download/146/179
2015-09-21T17:29:02 <colinclark> "Alterity In/Of Happiness: Reflecting on the radical possibilities of unruly bodies"
2015-09-21T17:29:21 <colinclark> I really love the expression "unruly bodies"
2015-09-21T17:29:43 <colinclark> Most of the article is a sort of reflection on Foucault and biopower, reframed as "biopedagogy"
2015-09-21T17:30:04 <danayo> thanks colinclark

2015-09-21T18:10:38 <colinclark> thanks danayo, I\'ll check out the video--it looks awesome
2015-09-21T18:11:07 <colinclark> simonjb, Justin_o: This is the Bret Victor article I was thinking of: http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/
2015-09-21T18:11:53 <colinclark> Two-thirds of the way down he identifies his own examples: Logo, Smalltalk, HyperCard, and Rocky\'s Boots
2015-09-21T18:12:10 <simonjb> Cool
2015-09-21T18:12:20 <colinclark> "This section will make reference to four seminal programming systems that were designed for learning, and I strongly recommend studying each of them... To be clear, I\'m not advocating using any of these systems, in either their historical or modern incarnations. I\'m advocating understanding them, and building on their insights."
2015-09-21T18:12:36 <colinclark> I guess this, too, will be the goal for our community meeting sessions
2015-09-21T18:13:10 <colinclark> to understand and build on the insights of historical systems for end-user creativity
2015-09-21T18:14:00 <colinclark> danayo: Charles responded almost instantly--he\'s into a Hypercard session. Do you want to work with Justin_o to come up with a good date for it?
2015-09-21T18:14:40 <danayo> sure thing
2015-09-21T18:27:36 <danayo> colinclark: reknitted!
2015-09-21T18:27:48 <colinclark> That first example is great, I think
2015-09-21T18:27:58 <colinclark> Amy Trigger Holroyd
2015-09-21T18:28:04 <colinclark> She takes the manufactured goods
2015-09-21T18:28:12 <colinclark> sweaters knit in really tight guages
2015-09-21T18:28:15 <colinclark> and modifies them
2015-09-21T18:28:30 <colinclark> talk about "undoing" a design :)
2015-09-21T18:28:44 <colinclark> This is her site: http://www.keepandshare.co.uk/
2015-09-21T18:29:27 <danayo> yes! was just looking at that - very cool colinclark
2015-09-21T18:29:36 <colinclark> Her research section is pretty interesting
2015-09-21T18:29:57 <colinclark> She\'s a friend of Bosmon\'s girlfriend, Rachael
2015-09-21T18:33:14 <danayo> i am so inspired by her work colinclark
2015-09-21T18:33:19 <danayo> so interesting
2015-09-21T18:33:19 <colinclark> me too!
2015-09-21T18:33:49 <colinclark> And we get to make it possible for software to do this, too!
2015-09-21T18:33:58 <danayo> yes!
