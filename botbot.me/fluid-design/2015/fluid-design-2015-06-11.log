2015-06-11T14:26:07 <maozillah> hey danayo , played around with some toggle options for the UIO, would appreciate any feedback or critique from the community, personally i like 7 and 9 the best in default & black on white mode, it eliminates the double border thing
2015-06-11T14:26:08 <maozillah> https://www.dropbox.com/s/k04elmy4lf067z7/UIO_toggle_v1.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-11T14:27:05 <maozillah> although 9 may be a bit heavy handed for the default mode, might reduce the border a bit for that
2015-06-11T14:27:46 <danayo> thanks maozillah, I will take a look. I'm in the meeting with MTO today until 3 so probably won't be able to discuss until then
2015-06-11T14:28:25 <anastasiac> maozillah: Thursdays is design crit day, where we all gather to talk about whatever. Perhaps that would be a good opportunity to show your ideas
2015-06-11T14:28:55 <maozillah> danayo: no worries, whenever you can! i\xe2\x80\x99ll finish up the mockup of the panel in the meantime. great idea!
2015-06-11T14:29:53 <danayo> any chance we could bump the crit until 3 or 3:30 today anastasiac? and fluid-everyone? sepideh and I are both in MTO meeting until then
2015-06-11T14:30:25 <anastasiac> that would be fine with me
2015-06-11T14:30:33 <simonjb> danayo: fine with me
2015-06-11T14:48:20 <danayo> maozillah it looks great - thanks for providing so many options. At first look I also think #7 is a good one. also - in some cases we may need more text in the panel so I think we should keep that in mind - making sure there's enough space
2015-06-11T14:49:29 <maozillah> danayo: thanks! i\xe2\x80\x99ll keep that in mind
2015-06-11T16:05:31 <danayo> maozillah this file contains some of the UIO icon assets, but I think there are some missing, let me know and I'll keep looking https://www.dropbox.com/s/98n861d7mhilhdl/uio-stencil.ai?dl=0
2015-06-11T16:07:27 <maozillah> thanks! it\xe2\x80\x99s ok, i can recreate any of the ones that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have
