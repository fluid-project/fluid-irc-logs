2015-05-13T16:09:27 <murilocrivellari> danaayotte: sorry to keep you waiting, I was putting everything together. Would you rather hear about the usability issues or the design suggestions?
2015-05-13T16:16:55 <danaayotte> murilocrivellari: no worries, I would love to hear both!
2015-05-13T16:17:35 <danaayotte> perhaps you could present them in relation to eachother, such as usability issue-suggested design solution
2015-05-13T16:21:42 <murilocrivellari> danaayotte: ok, this is my first contact with the project so I'm sorry if I point out something that's not relevant
2015-05-13T16:24:19 <murilocrivellari> first, on the language selection screen, the up/down arrows change the language when you click on them (e.g. it starts in English, and once you click the arrow down it changes to French. I think it'd be good if the arrows just scrolled through languages
2015-05-13T16:25:30 <murilocrivellari> so the user doesn't have to wait every time for it to refresh
2015-05-13T16:32:36 <danaayotte> thanks murilocrivellari , i'm not sure what's going on there but it appears that only French has been implemented. cindyli do you know what
2015-05-13T16:32:40 <danaayotte> what's up with that?
2015-05-13T16:38:24 <danaayotte> or Justin_o?
2015-05-13T16:38:38 <Justin_o> danaayotte: hello
2015-05-13T16:38:43 <danaayotte> hi
2015-05-13T16:38:57 <Justin_o> danaayotte: was your question about the translations?
2015-05-13T16:39:55 <danaayotte> it appears that the screen is being translated into French when scrolling through the list (without selecting French)
2015-05-13T16:40:16 <danaayotte> (and also that none of the other languages are yet active but I think that's because we're waiting for translations, right?)
2015-05-13T16:40:58 <Justin_o> danaayotte: we haven't received the translations yet, cindyli put some test translations in though. anastasiac will send off the translations request soon i think
2015-05-13T16:41:04 <danaayotte> yes, ok
2015-05-13T16:41:06 <Justin_o> as for the scrolling
2015-05-13T16:41:10 <danaayotte> yes
2015-05-13T16:41:11 <Justin_o> scrolling selects
2015-05-13T16:41:15 <danaayotte> right
2015-05-13T16:41:33 <Justin_o> so scrolling to french is the same as clicking on it
2015-05-13T16:41:56 <danaayotte> was there a technical reason we decided to go that way?
2015-05-13T16:42:06 <Justin_o> unfortunately with the need to refresh the page on changing the language, things are a bit jittery
2015-05-13T16:42:21 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-05-13T16:42:50 <Justin_o> danaayotte: not sure, but there isn't a button or anything on the ui that says it should be selected, so that's probably why
2015-05-13T16:42:54 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-13T16:43:06 <Justin_o> it could be related to the fact that we save always, and not on back/next
2015-05-13T16:45:14 <danaayotte> ok Justin_o, thanks
2015-05-13T16:45:54 <Justin_o> danaayotte: let us know if that is something that should be changed and what the priority for it is
2015-05-13T16:46:28 <Justin_o> danaayotte: with the keyboard it's kind of annoying, especially if you need to go to a language at the end of a list
2015-05-13T16:48:12 <danaayotte> yeah, and it looks like I have to tab to return to the list every time (before I can use arrow keys to move up or down)
2015-05-13T16:48:21 <danaayotte> Justin_o ^
2015-05-13T16:48:55 <Justin_o> yes, it loses focus.. bosmon had some thoughts on how me might be able to put focus back after rendering
2015-05-13T16:49:01 <Justin_o> danaayotte: ^
2015-05-13T16:49:10 <danaayotte> that would be much better Justin_o
2015-05-13T16:49:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^ do we have a jira for that yet?
2015-05-13T16:50:16 <danaayotte> murilocrivellari thanks for your feedback wanted to make sure you are following this discussion!
2015-05-13T16:50:22 <cindyli> yes, we do, Justin_o, danaayotte
2015-05-13T16:50:38 <murilocrivellari> danaayotte: I am!
2015-05-13T16:50:47 <danaayotte> good
2015-05-13T16:50:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: is it on the iteration page?
2015-05-13T16:51:01 <cindyli> issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-329
2015-05-13T16:51:16 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, it's on the iteration page too
2015-05-13T16:52:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-05-13T16:52:22 <cindyli> np
2015-05-13T16:54:41 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-13T16:54:52 <danaayotte> Justin_o I think it would be better if the arrow buttons just scrolled the list, and then the user could select their desired language by selecting the language button. I think this is also what murilocrivellari is suggesting.
2015-05-13T16:55:26 <danaayotte> I realise this means that the user will lose sight of the currently-selected language (the trangular indicator), but the language on the screen reveals which language is currently selected
2015-05-13T16:55:35 <Justin_o> danaayotte: you mean you'd have to click on the language with the mouse to select it?
2015-05-13T16:55:42 <danaayotte> yes
2015-05-13T16:56:25 <Justin_o> danaayotte: what if the user then tabbed, it should scroll and put focus back to the currently selected language?
2015-05-13T16:57:05 <danaayotte> yes, I think that would be best Justin_o
2015-05-13T16:57:14 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay
2015-05-13T16:57:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you see danaayotte's suggestions for improving the language adjuster
2015-05-13T16:57:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-05-13T16:58:55 <cindyli> yes, i see it, Justin_o
2015-05-13T17:02:24 <murilocrivellari> danaayotte: as we are speaking of languages, I volunteer to translate it into Brazilian Portuguese if you guys want me to
2015-05-13T17:06:20 <danaayotte> thanks murilocrivellari, it's probably a lower priority to add another language at this point, but we will eventually. do you agree Justin_o cindyli?
2015-05-13T17:29:12 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-13T17:30:15 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i'm not sure how hard it would be to add the extra language to the interface, we haven't received the translations yet, so it might be doable
2015-05-13T17:30:28 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-05-13T17:34:27 <sepideh> hi danaayotte, we are meeting in the standup room
2015-05-13T17:35:11 <danaayotte> thanks sepideh, be there in 2
2015-05-13T17:36:38 <cindyli> danaayotte, murilocrivellari, Justin_o: the styling for the currently selected language button includes two parts: 1, the arrow indicator; 2. the yellow or grey border around the button. do you think we should split them when users click on arrow buttons to scroll the language list, the arrow indicator still points to the selected language and the yellow border for the button that shows with the scrolling?
2015-05-13T17:38:00 <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry, i'm having trouble picture that
2015-05-13T17:41:54 * michelled joined the channel
2015-05-13T17:42:44 <cindyli> danaayotte, murilocrivellari, Justin_o, would be easier to have the panel in front of us. let's chat and share the screen when you guys are available
2015-05-13T17:43:34 <cindyli> btw, i created a jira for the improvement on the arrow buttons: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-334

2015-05-13T18:01:06 <cindyli> thanks, danaayotte, that's fine too. just wanna make sure
