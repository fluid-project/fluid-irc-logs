2015-04-22T13:15:14 <colinclark> morning, sepideh
2015-04-22T13:15:39 <sepideh> good morning colinclark
2015-04-22T13:16:08 <sepideh> did you have a chance to look at the latest mockup?
2015-04-22T13:16:12 <colinclark> yes
2015-04-22T13:16:16 <colinclark> they look great in our slides :)
2015-04-22T13:16:25 <colinclark> Kasper presented them this morning at our dress rehearsal
2015-04-22T13:16:29 <colinclark> and people seemed to like them
2015-04-22T13:16:32 <sepideh> really?? was it closer to what you had in mind?
2015-04-22T13:16:37 <colinclark> yep
2015-04-22T13:16:45 <colinclark> There\'s still lots to think through
2015-04-22T13:16:49 <colinclark> but this was exactly what we needed
2015-04-22T13:16:55 <colinclark> and they look visually so appealing
2015-04-22T13:17:28 <colinclark> which really valances their reception in a positive way
2015-04-22T13:17:38 <sepideh> great, when you are back we have to go through the process again more in depth
2015-04-22T13:17:46 <colinclark> yes
2015-04-22T13:17:47 <colinclark> definitely
2015-04-22T13:17:56 <colinclark> but this was totally perfect for the presentation
2015-04-22T13:18:06 <sepideh> I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear that:)
2015-04-22T13:18:18 <colinclark> thank you again
2015-04-22T13:18:23 <colinclark> I really really appreciate it
2015-04-22T13:18:27 <colinclark> especially with such short notice!
2015-04-22T13:18:47 <sepideh> no problem at all! It was so much fun:)
2015-04-22T13:19:16 <colinclark> Also
2015-04-22T13:20:11 <colinclark> another interesting possibility
2015-04-22T13:20:45 <colinclark> So Prosperity4All is split up into these "subprojects"
2015-04-22T13:20:48 <colinclark> as you probably know
2015-04-22T13:20:58 <colinclark> in SP3, we have partners who have various real applications
2015-04-22T13:21:03 <colinclark> some are business tools
2015-04-22T13:21:17 <colinclark> some are really cool assisttive technologies, accessible games, that kind of thing
2015-04-22T13:21:35 <colinclark> One of the SP3 partners has a large business analytics tool called Spago BI
2015-04-22T13:21:56 <colinclark> And they do a lot of charts and report generation
2015-04-22T13:22:03 <colinclark> on the fly from various kinds of business data
2015-04-22T13:22:22 <colinclark> sepideh: They were pretty interested in our work sonifying pie charts :)
2015-04-22T13:22:28 <colinclark> and ultimately other kinds of graphs and charts
2015-04-22T13:22:38 <sepideh> cool!!
2015-04-22T13:22:47 <sepideh> I am checking their websites now
2015-04-22T13:23:00 <colinclark> great
2015-04-22T13:23:27 <colinclark> They might be a nice first real user of our sonification work, once we design and implement it :)
2015-04-22T13:24:06 <sepideh> That would be great!
2015-04-22T13:24:39 <colinclark> yeah, it could be awesome
2015-04-22T13:25:19 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-04-22T13:31:22 <sepideh> So, colinclarck, when you are back, lets make a game plan for the sonification project as well as the DSpace dashboard in the next few month untill the July deliverable. thx

2015-04-22T13:51:04 <colinclark> Let\'s do it, sepideh
2015-04-22T13:51:17 <colinclark> I\'ll be back in the office and way less distracted on Monday
2015-04-22T13:51:21 <colinclark> and we can make a plan
2015-04-22T13:51:31 <sepideh> Awesome!!
2015-04-22T13:51:50 <colinclark> It\'s been interesting to hear various peoples\' impressions of our SP1 work on Prosperity4All, too
2015-04-22T13:52:14 <colinclark> I get an impression that maybe our first priority won\'t be to design actual user interfaces
2015-04-22T13:52:33 <colinclark> but more to channel users\' needs in such a way that gives people a kind of framework for thinking about how to design for personalization
2015-04-22T13:53:52 <colinclark> I\'m not sure what I think of that
2015-04-22T13:54:05 <colinclark> but it might allow us to focus our design activities more on the Dashboard and sonification
2015-04-22T13:54:24 <colinclark> and keep the P4A work more at a higher level of user scenarios, stories, and models of various kinds
2015-04-22T13:54:25 <colinclark> I\'m not sure
