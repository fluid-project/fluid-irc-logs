2015-05-27T15:08:52 <danaayotte> hi anastasiac  - where did the FD tool  "impressions of a first time user" come from? I\'m especially interested in the comments about the audio instructions being inadequate - was the user non-visual?
2015-05-27T15:09:07 <anastasiac> LOL
2015-05-27T15:09:35 <anastasiac> danaayotte, the two \xe2\x80\x9cimpressions\xe2\x80\x9d tables are my personal thoughts, upon looking at the tool with the hat of someone who\xe2\x80\x99s not that familiar with it
2015-05-27T15:09:40 <danaayotte> ah
2015-05-27T15:09:43 <anastasiac> just trying to predict what people might think
2015-05-27T15:09:57 <danaayotte> I see
2015-05-27T15:09:58 <danaayotte> thanks
2015-05-27T15:10:11 <anastasiac> and regarding the audio comments, danaayotte, I was trying to consider a non-visual user perspective
2015-05-27T15:10:18 <anastasiac> non-visual newbie
2015-05-27T15:10:38 <danaayotte> yeah. it brings up some good points
2015-05-27T15:11:06 <danaayotte> maybe we can label those tables more clearly
2015-05-27T15:11:10 <danaayotte> anastasiac
2015-05-27T15:11:58 <anastasiac> danaayotte, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss them at this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s meeting and decide what to do with them, after which point we\xe2\x80\x99ll likely create some JIRAs and move them into more proper locations
2015-05-27T15:12:05 <danaayotte> sounds good
2015-05-27T15:12:51 <danaayotte> thanks for putting those together anastasiac
2015-05-27T15:13:00 <anastasiac> danaayotte: I\xe2\x80\x99ve added \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d to the table headers :-)
2015-05-27T15:13:04 <danaayotte> thanks :)
