2015-06-03T14:55:08 <jhung> danayo: how important is having the voting booth look good in mobile? There are a few quirks, but not sure if it\'s worth fixing. Is it enough that the "desktop" version works for smaller screens?
2015-06-03T14:58:26 <danayo> jhung: I don\'t think it\'s a priority for the workshop. I think for the most part we\'ll be looking at the tool on laptops and tablets. anastasiac, does that sound right?
2015-06-03T14:59:11 <anastasiac> jhung: danayo is right - don\xe2\x80\x99t wory about mobile. Tablet should look ok, but phones, no
2015-06-03T14:59:57 <jhung> ok anastasiac, danayo - I\'ll check tablet.

2015-06-03T15:26:32 <murilo_crivellar> hi danayo, I gathered the prefs together so we can decide on the best order to present them. Here\'s the link https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpobv0o88varly6/List%20of%20Preferences.ai?dl=0
2015-06-03T15:35:44 * sepideh has quit
2015-06-03T15:54:46 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-06-03T16:07:22 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: thanks i\'m just thinking through the order now. there are some other interesting dependencies coming up between preferences.
2015-06-03T16:07:32 <danayo> for example, full keyboard control and on-screen keyboard
2015-06-03T16:07:39 <danayo> full keyboard control and cursor speed
2015-06-03T16:08:21 <danayo> that is, if you want full keyboard control you probably don\'t care about the cursor speed
2015-06-03T16:08:40 <danayo> i\'m putting together a rough order and then I\'ll ping you murilo_crivellar
2015-06-03T16:08:56 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: ok
2015-06-03T16:30:07 * colinclark has quit
2015-06-03T16:34:04 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: here is the order I think is best https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxhc5utspf2tj37/FD%20preference%20order%20June%202015.rtf?dl=0
2015-06-03T16:34:45 <danayo> the "dep" refers to a preference that may or may not be presented based on a previous selection
2015-06-03T16:34:52 <danayo> but we don\'t have to worry about that for now
2015-06-03T16:35:02 <danayo> we may just want to flag those somehow
2015-06-03T16:35:21 <danayo> but what we want for this is to show all the preferences in order
2015-06-03T16:35:41 <danayo> and the notes at the bottom are just some thoughts I had while going through this
2015-06-03T16:36:06 <danayo> anastasiac, what do you think of the preference order?
2015-06-03T16:36:33 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: Ok, so the "dep" preferences must be flagged, is that so?
2015-06-03T16:37:21 <danayo> yeah, I\'m not sure yet murilo_crivellar - I don\'t want it to get in the way too much, maybe just something very subtle
2015-06-03T16:37:38 <anastasiac> danayo, murilo_crivellar: for voicing, I might move the speed right after self-voicing, but not critical.
2015-06-03T16:37:49 <danayo> I wanted it to come after point and speak
2015-06-03T16:37:52 <anastasiac> for visual, I might do size first, but that\xe2\x80\x99s very, very arguable
2015-06-03T16:37:57 <danayo> but actually I guess it doesn\'t have to
2015-06-03T16:38:15 <anastasiac> the rest look great to me
2015-06-03T16:38:18 * cindyli has quit
2015-06-03T16:38:21 <danayo> thanks anastasaic
2015-06-03T16:38:21 <anastasiac> danayo, what\xe2\x80\x99s your though process on that?
2015-06-03T16:38:26 <danayo> anastasiac
2015-06-03T16:38:30 <anastasiac> the voicing order
2015-06-03T16:38:59 <danayo> well in retrospect I don\'t think it makes sense
2015-06-03T16:39:24 <danayo> I was thinking it would be clearer to the user that they were setting the speed for both
2015-06-03T16:39:32 <danayo> but I don\'t think it matters
2015-06-03T16:39:38 <anastasiac> interesting
2015-06-03T16:39:51 <anastasiac> I was thinking that if they need to adjust the speed to help understand, then the sooner the better
2015-06-03T16:40:11 <danayo> yes I think that makes good sense, I\'ll rearrange it
2015-06-03T16:40:15 <danayo> also: re size
2015-06-03T16:40:21 <danayo> right now we have contrast first
2015-06-03T16:40:37 <danayo> in the functional tool that is
2015-06-03T16:41:15 <danayo> I believe our thinking was that once the colour/contrast is changed, it might affect the user\'s size needs
2015-06-03T16:41:31 <danayo> anastasiac ^
2015-06-03T16:42:03 <anastasiac> good point, danayo, I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly happy to leav it
2015-06-03T16:42:44 <danayo> ok thanks
2015-06-03T16:44:04 * michelled has quit
2015-06-03T16:45:16 <danayo> ok murilo_crivellar I have updated the order
2015-06-03T16:46:19 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: great
2015-06-03T16:46:47 <murilo_crivellar> now, should I keep with the safari template?
2015-06-03T16:46:53 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: ^
2015-06-03T16:47:59 <danayo> ah right, murilo_crivellar ... I say let\'s keep it simple and just show the panels on their own
2015-06-03T16:48:16 <danayo> michelled, anastasiac - murilo_crivellar had started a template showing the tool in a browser window
2015-06-03T16:48:33 <danayo> and we were wondering if that was the best approach
2015-06-03T16:48:59 <danayo> I think just showing the panels on their own would be best - maybe less distracting
2015-06-03T16:49:45 <danayo> sepideh, can we check in quickly? I have to be in 220 room commissioning in 10 minutes and wanted to catch you before then
2015-06-03T16:50:22 <sepideh> sure
2015-06-03T16:51:02 <danayo> you appear to be not online in vidyo sepideh
2015-06-03T16:51:04 <anastasiac> danayo, murilo_crivellar: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we need to include a mock browser in the mock-ups, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean. Just the panels is fine
2015-06-03T16:51:07 <danayo> as in, offline :)
2015-06-03T16:51:22 <danayo> yes that\'s what we meant anastasiac, thanks
2015-06-03T16:51:35 <anastasiac> our audience knows it\xe2\x80\x99s in a browser
2015-06-03T16:51:51 <anastasiac> and many of them have been looking at the wireframes, so they\xe2\x80\x99re familiar
2015-06-03T16:55:24 <murilo_crivellar> anastasiac, danayo ok, I\'ll start right away. Just one more question: I\'m thinking of doing a multi-page pdf file. Is that ok?
2015-06-03T16:55:38 <murilo_crivellar> one panel per page
2015-06-03T16:56:13 <anastasiac> murilo_crivellar: that sounds good to me. it will allow us to simulate what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to step through multiple pages
2015-06-03T16:56:28 <murilo_crivellar> anastasiac: great, thanks!

2015-06-03T17:39:41 <danayo> sepideh I just noticed something - when you go to add an action in InDesign, you can actually see that they are split into those available in pdfs and those not
2015-06-03T17:39:47 <danayo> a button action I mean
2015-06-03T17:39:57 <danayo> Go To Page is not listed under pdf
2015-06-03T17:40:21 <danayo> I found a forum where someone suggested creating bookmarks on a page, and then connecting to the bookmark rather than the page itself
2015-06-03T17:42:04 <danayo> so you can use Go To Destination to link to the bookmark
2015-06-03T17:42:40 <danayo> sepideh ^
2015-06-03T17:44:01 <sepideh> awesome Dana! thanks a lot :)
2015-06-03T17:45:31 <danayo> yeah, maybe too late for this one but for future
2015-06-03T17:50:34 <sepideh> danayo, anastasiac could you please have a look at this and let me know what you think? you need to zoom out. The first time you go through it screens talk a split of a second to load, but after the frist time the experience is much smoother.
2015-06-03T17:50:34 <sepideh> http://invis.io/EJ363X12Z
2015-06-03T17:52:44 <danayo> sepideh I think we need a way to get from splash page to language page, yes?
2015-06-03T17:52:59 <anastasiac> sepideh: how to I zoom out?
2015-06-03T17:53:36 <danayo> I can do it with the arrow keys on my keyboard but there is no button
2015-06-03T17:53:58 <danayo> anastasiac you should just be able to control/command - , no?
2015-06-03T17:54:32 <anastasiac> danayo:  that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the actual screens, only the invision controls
2015-06-03T17:54:48 <danayo> which browser?
2015-06-03T17:54:52 <anastasiac> ff
2015-06-03T17:54:56 <danayo> a
2015-06-03T17:54:57 <danayo> h
2015-06-03T17:55:05 <danayo> works in chrome
2015-06-03T17:55:17 <danayo> but not in safari either
2015-06-03T17:55:23 <anastasiac> ah
2015-06-03T17:56:19 <sepideh> command+ minus
2015-06-03T17:56:37 <anastasiac> sepideh: that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work in FIrefox, but it\xe2\x80\x99s ok in Chrome
2015-06-03T17:57:45 <anastasiac> sepideh: this is looking good!

2015-06-03T18:09:49 <danayo> sepideh not sure if you saw my comment earlier but I think we need a Go or Start button on the first screen
2015-06-03T18:10:28 <sepideh> sure, I had made the logo interactive, but i can definitely add a start button
2015-06-03T18:14:58 <danayo> oh ok I think that\'s fine
2015-06-03T18:15:33 <danayo> sepideh can you share the inVision project with me?
2015-06-03T18:15:42 <danayo> I have an inVision account

2015-06-03T18:20:39 <sepideh> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do right now
2015-06-03T18:34:01 <danayo> thanks sepideh
2015-06-03T18:34:52 <danayo> one thing I noticed sepideh anastasiac is that because we don\'t have separate branches in the prototype, sometimes the back button takes you somewhere you didn\'t come from
2015-06-03T18:35:40 <danayo> for example: have you ever used a computer (NO) --> do you prefer to have the computer speak to you (back) --> do you have any difficulty reading things on the screen
2015-06-03T18:36:04 <sepideh> I know, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the disadvantages\xe2\x80\xa6. so we should try to not use back if possible.
2015-06-03T18:36:37 <danayo> I think it will be ok for what we want to demonstrate
2015-06-03T18:37:10 <sepideh> So, the way anastasiac  was using it was going through one path all the way to the intake form and then pressing mysettings to go back to the language page to try out another path
2015-06-03T18:43:28 <danayo> ah good I was wondering how to restart, didn\'t realise the my settings was active, thanks sepideh
2015-06-03T18:44:26 <sepideh> Maybe we could make another lement on each page e.g. th elittle logo on the bottom left corner function as a restart button. what do you think?

2015-06-03T19:20:20 <sepideh> danayo, Colin suggested to show the digilit (tutorial page) when user indicates they have never used the computer before we take them through other preferences.
2015-06-03T19:21:25 <sepideh> I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. If you agree I can include the tutorial page that we had for desktops in there
