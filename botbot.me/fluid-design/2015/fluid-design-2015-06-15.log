2015-06-15T19:55:45 <sepideh> jessm: Katerina and I tried mapping out one of our developer persona to the User states and context map last week, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite work out. So, how do you suggest using this diagram for persona\xe2\x80\x99s that may not have specific needs or preferences?

2015-06-15T20:12:26 * danayo wondering about sepideh's question
2015-06-15T20:12:35 * jessm seeing it anew and fretting...
2015-06-15T20:12:49 <jessm> sepideh: and i are gonna be with MTO during the P4A call
2015-06-15T20:12:59 <danayo> yes I wondered about that jessm
2015-06-15T20:13:08 <jessm> i think the mapping to US&C can come laterz. now, i think a mapping to the layers from last week makes sense
2015-06-15T20:13:21 <jessm> building on our bi-weekly successes as it were
2015-06-15T20:13:44 <danayo> where are those layers captured jessm? in meeting minutes?
2015-06-15T20:14:06 <jessm> nopes, i think they were gonna be the iterations on the work that sepideh and kevin showed the team last mtg.
2015-06-15T20:14:39 <jessm> but hey, look, sepideh that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot o\xe2\x80\x99 work to do plus MTO, so perhaps we lay out the draft or the idea or just the personae and say what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do
2015-06-15T20:15:05 <jessm> danayo: any suggestions for what to do re: the meeting and sepideh and me not being there?
2015-06-15T20:15:08 * danayo wondering how she can help
2015-06-15T20:15:22 <danayo> weird you have to do that in third person for it to make sense :)
2015-06-15T20:15:46 * jessm thinks danayo can help muchly. sounds like yoda, no?
2015-06-15T20:16:08 <sepideh> That\xe2\x80\x99s a good plan. I still try to get out at least one example of those interactions tomorrow to share with team and get their feedback and show them what they should expect thesse layers tobe
2015-06-15T20:16:58 <jessm> sepideh: can you share that and the personae as-is and have time to work on the MTO stuff? or what can danayo help with?
2015-06-15T20:17:08 <jessm> danayo: i wonder if you can run the P4A mtg? eek
2015-06-15T20:17:48 <sepideh> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99m in good shape for MTO, I think. I can talk to danayo tomorrow about P4A
2015-06-15T20:18:17 <danayo> that would be great sepideh, perhaps we 3 can meet jessm?
2015-06-15T20:18:20 <danayo> or today?
2015-06-15T20:18:28 <jessm> danayo: with that convo plus the rough structure of the mtgs. (updates from everyone and then the new stuff) \xe2\x80\x94 w/ notes in piratepad, you ok to do that?
2015-06-15T20:19:10 <jessm> yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s we three chit chat. I have to leave at 5 tonight. but i\xe2\x80\x99m super free tomorrow
2015-06-15T20:19:16 <sepideh> today, I have to finish the MTO and leave in 45 min. So if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind we can have it tomorrow
2015-06-15T20:20:31 <jessm> danayo: do you still have Ux tomorrow a.m. or those got postponed for now?
2015-06-15T20:20:45 <danayo> ok jessm sepideh, I think I can handle it :)
2015-06-15T20:20:53 <danayo> ux meetings on hold for now jessm
2015-06-15T20:21:03 <sepideh> thanks a lot danayo
