2015-11-05T18:53:55 <danayo> trying now gtirloni, thanks for email
2015-11-05T18:55:03 <danayo> got it gtirloni
2015-11-05T18:55:30 <danayo> gtirloni_
2015-11-05T18:55:51 <gtirloni_> cool
2015-11-05T18:56:01 <gtirloni_> it's a weird process :/ we're pushing to have it changed
2015-11-05T18:56:18 <danayo> :)
2015-11-05T19:00:52 <colinclark> danayo: It feels so weird... I think I more or less asked you for a funcitonal specification about our sound designs for the chart authoring tool
2015-11-05T19:01:04 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-05T19:01:09 <colinclark> Functional specs suck
2015-11-05T19:01:16 <colinclark> Equally, we can just talk it through, here or wherever at some point if you'd prefer
2015-11-05T19:01:34 <colinclark> although it's sometimes good just to formalize it slightly, like we often do with little text annotations on a wireframe for example

2015-11-05T19:06:07 <danayo> for sure colinclark, i think it\xe2\x80\x99s fine, maybe what i\xe2\x80\x99ll do is add a description on the wiki page, and then we can discuss ?
2015-11-05T19:06:19 <colinclark> yup, sounds sensible
