2015-08-24T15:00:10 <murilocrivellari> good morning jhung, danayo. I\'ve been doing some adjustments on the Chart Authoring Tool based on your feedback. Would you mind checking this file? Is this what you guys had in mind? https://www.dropbox.com/s/13572phk3pdjvqd/CA%20Tool%20%5BVersion%209%5D.pdf?dl=0
2015-08-24T15:00:43 <jhung> sure murilocrivellari
2015-08-24T15:00:57 <danayo> thanks murilocrivellari, i\'ll take a look
2015-08-24T15:01:02 <murilocrivellari> I removed the reset button, added the same background as the mobile version and tried to incorporate the play button directly on the chart
2015-08-24T15:01:08 <murilocrivellari> thanks guys :)
2015-08-24T15:03:27 <jhung> murilocrivellari: I see two pages on that PDF and both pages look the same to me. Should they be different or are they the same?
2015-08-24T15:05:28 <murilocrivellari> jhung: they are slightly different. The first has squares separating each section on the data entry form, the second has just one big square. I did that in order to save space
2015-08-24T15:06:44 <jhung> ah. I missed that. Thanks murilocrivellari.
2015-08-24T15:22:35 <danayo> murilocrivellari: i think it\'s looking good! I like the consistency with the mobile design, and I prefer the simpler design on the second page (fewer nested boxes). I also like the play button within the chart, but wonder if it works well once the chart is populated? have you tried sketching that?
2015-08-24T15:24:09 * michelled joined the channel
2015-08-24T15:28:28 <murilocrivellari> not yet, danayo. It will be my next step. I guess that it would look like a ring graph, if that makes sense. I\'ll sketch that up and share with you when it is done
2015-08-24T15:28:58 <murilocrivellari> thanks for your feedback :)

2015-08-24T16:00:40 <colinclark> It was only shared with a few people
2015-08-24T16:00:54 <colinclark> It\'s feedback about the year 3 proposal
2015-08-24T16:01:02 <danayo> ah ok
2015-08-24T16:01:08 <colinclark> not about the stuff we did for year 2

2015-08-24T17:02:52 <murilocrivellari> sure jhung, what time do you want to chat?
2015-08-24T17:02:53 <danayo> sounds good jhung - murilocrivellari - can we meet in an hour?

2015-08-24T18:10:58 <jhung> danayo, murilocrivellari: I was wondering if it would be okay to chat in the channel? This way others can chime in if they want. What do you think?
2015-08-24T18:11:43 <danayo> sure jhung
2015-08-24T18:12:13 <murilocrivellari> jhung: sure
2015-08-24T18:12:40 <jhung> murilocrivellari, danayo: here\'s an *UGLY* sketch I did a few minutes ago. Take a look and then I can talk through what I\'m thinking...
2015-08-24T18:12:42 <jhung> https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fv61pauv7q88ba/Office%20Lens%2020150824-134409.jpg?dl=0

2015-08-24T18:14:22 <sepidehshahi> danayo: are you available sometime today to go over Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the survey?
2015-08-24T18:16:06 <jhung> murilocrivellari danayo: let me know once you\'ve had a chance to look at the sketch. I can then try to describe my thinking...
2015-08-24T18:18:13 <murilocrivellari> I\'m looking at it right now jhung. If you want to describe it...
2015-08-24T18:18:32 <danayo> i had a look jhung. sepidehshahi might want to take a look as well - https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fv61pauv7q88ba/Office%20Lens%2020150824-134409.jpg?dl=0. Curious about the %value slider and also the lock value toggle
2015-08-24T18:19:12 * michelled joined the channel
2015-08-24T18:19:49 <jhung> I was attempting to figure a way to make the chart generation aspect feel less like a spreadsheet. So my thinking was that by default the chart has 2 slices which the author can edit.
2015-08-24T18:20:02 <jhung> To edit you tap or click on a slice or a label.
2015-08-24T18:20:27 <jhung> That would then expand the label area to show additional editing features.
2015-08-24T18:21:22 <jhung> The slider is an easy way to quickly adjust values on mobile or tablet. (Keyboard entry is a pain sometimes on mobile).
2015-08-24T18:22:47 <jhung> The lock value is there so that the value stays fixed - this is used primarily when you adjust the value of other items.
2015-08-24T18:24:22 <murilocrivellari> jhung: you mean that the lock feature would prevent the percentage to altering when you adjust the other values?
2015-08-24T18:24:52 <jhung> i.e. If you lock sample 1 at 20%. when you try to adjust sample 2, from 80 to 70, the remaining 10% doesn\'t get added to sample 1, instead it goes unallocated.
2015-08-24T18:24:52 <jhung> murilocrivellari: yeah.
2015-08-24T18:25:08 <jhung> It would be even cooler if you can actually rotate the slice sizes directly my dragging the corners of each slice around the pie.
2015-08-24T18:25:40 <jhung> Then we wouldn\'t need sliders. We would just directly manipulate the pie to change its values.
2015-08-24T18:25:56 <jhung> Like moving hands on a clock.
2015-08-24T18:25:58 <danayo> ok. I\'m wondering about entering values as % rather than absolutes. and I\'m thinking a user might want more accuracy than that (then sliding the pie segments woudl give them)
2015-08-24T18:26:09 <sepidehshahi> jhung: it looks good. The concern that I have with this approach is that there are many hidden elements and as you tap through different slices things keep appearing and disappearing.
2015-08-24T18:27:58 <jhung> danayo: it doesn\'t have to be a slider. It\'s there as an illustration. A text field for a number value makes more sense.
2015-08-24T18:28:53 <danayo> ok jhung
2015-08-24T18:29:30 <jhung> sepidehshahi: that\'s a valid concern, but I\'m wondering if given the right cues it\'ll be okay? The reason I thought of starting with 2 example values is to invite the author to edit them.
2015-08-24T18:30:29 <jhung> Again, the main motivation I was thinking was to move away from the spreadsheet convention and more toward a specialized tool made for sonified pie charts.
2015-08-24T18:31:35 <danayo> jhung can you explain the advantage of being able to lock a value? and would user be prompted to complete to 100% if there is unallocated %?
2015-08-24T18:33:22 <jhung> The locking only made sense if you\'re using % values as input. But as we have decided since then, % input and a slider makes little sense because of accuracy and the usability issues raised.
2015-08-24T18:33:36 <jhung> We\'d remove the lock button. It was only there because of the slider and % input.
2015-08-24T18:34:45 <murilocrivellari> jhung: how would the interaction work with these editable fields? Using the keyboard, I mean
2015-08-24T18:35:04 * alanharnum has quit
2015-08-24T18:36:39 <danayo> got it jhung
2015-08-24T18:36:55 <jhung> The list of samples to the right of the chart would be like a list you navigate with up and down arrows. Pressing Enter on an item would expand that item like an accordion to reveal the fields. Focus would go to the first editable field in what was reveled.
2015-08-24T18:37:09 <jhung> User can tab through the revealed fields.
2015-08-24T18:38:01 <jhung> Once focus reaches the last revealed field, the next tab would close it and focus would then be put onto the next sample in the list.
2015-08-24T18:38:06 <jhung> Something like that.
2015-08-24T18:38:50 <murilocrivellari> ok, thanks jhung. I\'m also curious about the sonification features on the bottom of the page. What do you have in mind for that?
2015-08-24T18:40:00 <jhung> Admittedly this section of the sketch is less well thought out murilocrivellari. Ideally i\'d love to have it more tightly integrated with the activities related to the chart.
2015-08-24T18:40:24 <jhung> But what I have shown there murilocrivellari are some of the global audio "styles" someone can choose to spice up their sonification.
2015-08-24T18:40:39 <jhung> Like choosing a different narrator, and the prompts.
2015-08-24T18:41:08 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-24T18:41:14 <jhung> These would be defaults the author specified, but the end user can set up preferences to use a different narrator, prompt, etc.
2015-08-24T18:41:43 <danayo> so one big difference from what we have now (the "spreadsheet") is that you populate the chart up front with editable values, right? I like that. I like that it provides some guidance for the user. It sounds like the expanded value entry area woudln\'t necessarily look that different then what we have now? I ask because I\'m wondering about consistency for other chart types (as we develop further). Consistency of how values are entered
2015-08-24T18:41:44 <danayo> might be good (i.e. if we have one tool with multiple chart types)
2015-08-24T18:43:06 <jhung> danayo: good point. Yes. Definitely a lot of the hard work murilocrivellari is still useful.
2015-08-24T18:43:23 <jhung> I guess the bottom line is that I\'ve proposed a different way / usage for the pie area.
2015-08-24T18:45:00 <danayo> yes, I like that it\'s more interactive
2015-08-24T18:45:11 <murilocrivellari> I like it, jhung. I can definitely sketch this up so we have a better sense of the visuals
2015-08-24T18:45:19 <murilocrivellari> if you want me to
2015-08-24T18:45:35 <jhung> what do others think?
2015-08-24T18:46:34 <jhung> I intended this to be a point of discussion which hopefully leads to some new ideas. By no means take what I\'ve and design something based on it.
2015-08-24T18:46:57 <michelled> danayo: the dropbox link on this JIRA is broken - do you have another link for the wireframe? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-295
2015-08-24T18:47:11 <jhung> Although I think we can use a little more hot pink with a sketchy style. :)
2015-08-24T18:48:01 <danayo> michelled I\'ll find a link on the wiki and replace
2015-08-24T18:48:34 <michelled> thx
2015-08-24T18:49:24 <murilocrivellari> jhung: and I\'m very glad we got to have this discussion. I think I can use what I have and add some of the ideas we\'ve just discussed. It will prevent trouble for the devs as well. Is that so?
2015-08-24T18:50:16 <jhung> lol I don\'t know about preventing trouble with the developers murilocrivellari. :D
2015-08-24T18:51:42 <jhung> Maybe danayo and sepidehshahi could chime in whether or not it\'s worth going in this direction for a bit. Maybe colinclark has an opinion? (*poke*)
2015-08-24T18:52:45 <colinclark> jhung: sure, lemme just catch up
2015-08-24T18:53:16 <jhung> Starts at 2:12 colinclark

2015-08-24T19:04:22 <colinclark> jhung1, murilocrivellari I\'d say cause some trouble for the developers :)
2015-08-24T19:04:57 <alanharnum> :(
2015-08-24T19:05:13 <colinclark> alanharnum: You love challenges!
2015-08-24T19:05:20 * jhung1 \\o/
2015-08-24T19:06:02 <colinclark> jhung1: It sounds like your goal was to try to create an even more direct interaction for editing the chart, which I like. It\'s something we\'ve talked about it in the past, too. I know sepidehshahi has thought of some of the pros and cons of a more direct style of interaction
2015-08-24T19:06:11 <alanharnum> i will have to check if our vendor licensing agreement for JavaScript supports whatever it is we want to do
2015-08-24T19:06:34 <alanharnum> we may need to purchase more JavaScript licenses
2015-08-24T19:06:36 <colinclark> alanharnum: You\'ll have to issue an RFP to purchase the EXPANDED FEATURE SET MODULE
2015-08-24T19:07:08 <colinclark> it sounds like the "expanded" view will still be more like the spreadsheet
2015-08-24T19:07:10 <colinclark> which is cool
2015-08-24T19:07:16 <colinclark> and leverages work done to date
2015-08-24T19:07:30 <colinclark> my sense is that we should continue to iterate at two different time scales
2015-08-24T19:07:30 <alanharnum> colinclark: EXPANDED FEATURE SET supports four different additional kinds of loops, and adds seven different collection types, all with slightly different behaviour
2015-08-24T19:07:45 <colinclark> "now" and "later"
2015-08-24T19:08:07 <colinclark> so jhung1 and murilocrivellari: if we\'re playing with the idea of implementing a much more direct style of interaction, I\'d say go all the way
2015-08-24T19:08:35 <colinclark> and extend what you\'ve been playing with to really focus on "this chart here is what you interact with"
2015-08-24T19:09:44 <jhung1> +1 I like that idea. Which is why I think the sketch I did actually falls a bit short because the sonification aspects aren\'t well integrated.
2015-08-24T19:10:10 <jhung1> but as I said, I was hoping for this to start a discussion\xe2\x80\xa6 which it has.
2015-08-24T19:10:21 <jhung1> So I\'m done here. :D
2015-08-24T19:13:56 <colinclark> :)

2015-08-24T19:28:41 <colinclark> In the meantime, we\'ll let the developers keep developing on the "now" line of the designs while we consider "later"
2015-08-24T19:28:48 <colinclark> and eventually we\'ll converge the two
