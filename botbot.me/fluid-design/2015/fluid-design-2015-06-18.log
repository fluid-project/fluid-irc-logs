2015-06-18T16:56:51 <danayo> not sure how long that will be

2015-06-18T16:57:29 <sepideh> 4:30 works for me as well Jess_
2015-06-18T16:57:42 <Jess_> great, sepideh danayo thanks
2015-06-18T16:59:21 <simonjb> Jess_: that eye test thing is interesting and also super-dependent on the colour reproducing capabilities of your display
2015-06-18T16:59:51 <Jess_> simonjb: i noticed that \xe2\x80\x94 found myself moving my head around on a few of the harder ones
2015-06-18T17:00:21 <danayo> ah that's why i'm not a hawk! it was my display haha
2015-06-18T17:00:49 <simonjb> once it gets to the more fine differences, it will be very display dependent
2015-06-18T17:03:40 <sepideh> danayo: I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to meet anytime regarding P4A meeting and Quality Dashboard.
