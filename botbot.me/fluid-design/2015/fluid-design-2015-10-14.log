2015-10-14T14:15:43 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo, I have cloned your repository and playing with the git desktop, you may receive lots of notifications about random things, please ignore them:)
2015-10-14T14:17:35 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi! I tried putting a garage band project folder in there, but it seems to have been committed only as the individual files - let me know if you\'re able to open the project in garage band
2015-10-14T14:17:56 <sepidehshahi> sure
2015-10-14T14:23:14 <sepidehshahi> danayo: unfortunately I can\xe2\x80\x99t open the raw audio files in garage band
2015-10-14T14:25:30 <danayo> yeah, not sure what to do about that

2015-10-14T15:49:27 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I noticed the highlight column for the AT users. That is great. I\xe2\x80\x99ll add my comments there as well. pelase let me know if I could do anything for documenting the sonification process.

2015-10-14T16:57:02 <danayo> hi jhung, i like where your ring design is going...I tried this, I think it\'s a bit boring though https://www.dropbox.com/s/ej3vyg6gu4c6du7/Open%20Education%20Alliance%20Banner-03.png?dl=0
2015-10-14T16:58:44 <jhung> danayo: I like that direction too. I was thinking that the background grid could be in different colours and spill downward past the gird?

2015-10-14T16:59:56 <jhung> Were you thinking that the space below the logos would be for some blurb?
2015-10-14T17:00:00 <jhung> ^ danayo

2015-10-14T17:00:21 <danayo> yes jhung
2015-10-14T17:00:27 <danayo> but dont\' know if we need one or not
2015-10-14T17:00:54 * simonjb_ is now known as simonjb
2015-10-14T17:01:38 <danayo> do you mean the  grid lines in different colours jhung?
2015-10-14T17:01:39 <jhung> danayo: I like your design - easier on the eyes. I\'m going to play with the colours a little and see what effect that has.
2015-10-14T17:01:43 <danayo> ok
2015-10-14T17:01:44 <danayo> cool
2015-10-14T17:03:46 * alanharnum has quit
2015-10-14T17:11:15 <jhung> danayo: I couldn\'t get my idea to work on your grids. Perhaps Lisa or sepidehshahi can take a look?
2015-10-14T17:11:26 <jhung> I do think that there should be a blurb though...
2015-10-14T17:11:53 <jhung> at least something that describes why we\'re collaborating?
2015-10-14T17:11:59 <jhung> Or is that obvious?
2015-10-14T17:15:39 <danayo> I think we need some brief text describing what we\'re doing together jhung
2015-10-14T17:15:53 <danayo> i\'ll try something
2015-10-14T17:16:04 <danayo> based on website text
2015-10-14T17:16:11 <jhung> danayo: great
2015-10-14T17:32:53 <danayo> how about this jhung
2015-10-14T17:32:56 <danayo> The Inclusive Design and Accessibility OpenEd Alliance is working together to create an engaging and immersive experience where participants can try a perspective shift, discover how to make content, code, and designs more inclusive, and learn to leverage the flexibility, variability, and extensibility of open resources to reach new learners.
2015-10-14T17:32:57 <danayo> Join us to learn more about OER, inclusive design, and accessibility!
2015-10-14T17:33:36 <danayo> i guess i don\'t need the  join us part
2015-10-14T17:33:41 <danayo> for the banner
2015-10-14T17:34:45 <jhung> danayo: I think we may want to condense that a little. If the banner is in a high-traffic place, I don\'t know how many people will stand there and read it.
2015-10-14T17:36:26 <jhung> How about\xe2\x80\xa6 "Working together to create egaging experiences. Make. Code. Design. Shift." Something like that danayo?
2015-10-14T17:39:42 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-10-14T17:40:16 <danayo> thanks jhung, i think condensing is good, let me try that and see - don\'t want to lose the idea of opened and inclusive design, but maybe the name says enough
2015-10-14T17:40:44 <jhung> danayo: definitely add that back in. I just did a quick machete job. :)
2015-10-14T17:55:28 <danayo> what do you think of this jhung? https://www.dropbox.com/s/ej3vyg6gu4c6du7/Open%20Education%20Alliance%20Banner-03.png?dl=0
2015-10-14T17:58:27 <jhung> looks awesome danayo. Maybe bold "shift", "Discover", and "Learn"? Also it looks like "2015" is bolder than the other text. Intentional?
2015-10-14T17:59:55 <danayo> thanks jhung. the 2015 is just larger font, both semibold, but i\'ll try making it regular
