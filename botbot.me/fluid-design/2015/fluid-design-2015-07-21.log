2015-07-21T14:41:09 <sepideh> jessm: here is the updated table. The only missing links are from Katerina and Eva\xe2\x80\x99s diagrams. They have distributed images via email, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any URL to include in the table. We they permit, we can include their diagrams in the wiki and then include a link to them in this table. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/P4All+-+SP1+Components+List+for+Design+kit

2015-07-21T16:57:07 <alanharnum> sepideh: http://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/javascript-graphs-and-charts-libraries
2015-07-21T16:57:17 <alanharnum> came across this Googling around for something else
2015-07-21T16:57:45 <alanharnum> as an example of something else in the wild, not an endorsement of the design ;)
2015-07-21T16:58:03 <sepideh> No this is Great! thanks alanharnum
2015-07-21T16:59:59 <sepideh> It\xe2\x80\x99s very practical, just a table listing all the items that might be interesting for a develper. It looks very busy but you can easily find your required content.
