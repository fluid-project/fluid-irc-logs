2015-08-31T20:21:04 <danayo> simonjb do you have time to discuss UIO security?
2015-08-31T20:21:21 <danayo> I sketched up a flow and wonder if this looks right to you https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbALs9keCz867gL7knFMTofWA2JcihUQo6YM-aYBl4s/edit

2015-08-31T20:43:23 <danayo> oops sorry simonjb, should be good now

2015-08-31T14:43:36 <danayo> tried to join the call but no luck
2015-08-31T15:01:22 <simonjb> hi danayo, the links that we have on the GPII Security Dashboard for the "Privacy Settings with preferences selection" and "Privacy Settings without preferences selection" are giving me 404s
2015-08-31T15:01:32 <simonjb> would you have updated links that I could use?
2015-08-31T15:01:50 <danayo> sorry about that simonjb, I\'ll get you updated links
2015-08-31T15:02:24 <simonjb> thanks danayo

2015-08-31T15:07:31 <danayo> alternatively I could attack to fluid wiki and update links
2015-08-31T15:07:36 <danayo> *attach
2015-08-31T15:10:26 <simonjb> danayo: there is an "Upload file" link at the bottom of the left bar under "Tools"
2015-08-31T15:10:45 <simonjb> danayo: I think uploading to the GPII wiki is a good idea
2015-08-31T15:11:18 <simonjb> danayo: I\'ve used the upload file mechanism in the past -- they aren\'t per-page attachments but are global for the wiki
2015-08-31T15:11:28 <danayo> ah ok simonjb thanks

2015-08-31T16:47:56 <simonjb> hi danayo, were you able to upload the designs to the GPII wiki?
2015-08-31T16:59:30 <danayo> sorry simonjb, the file was too big, and then I got distracted. I think I\'ll upload to fluidproject wiki and add link
2015-08-31T16:59:46 <danayo> do you need the files right away? I can give you updated dropbox links
2015-08-31T17:01:15 <simonjb> danayo: the dropbox links would be great, I\'d like to look at them soon, thanks
2015-08-31T17:03:07 <danayo> here is the first one: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qnhmbtf86eil741/privacy%20settings%20with%20prefs%20scope.pdf?dl=0
2015-08-31T17:03:20 <danayo> and the second: https://www.dropbox.com/s/iis0kxormxh9jea/privacy%20settings%20nov%2013%20%28no%20prefs%20scope%29.pdf?dl=0
2015-08-31T17:03:53 <danayo> simonjb ^
2015-08-31T17:05:23 <simonjb> thanks danayo -- if I go ahead and update the links on the GPII wiki page, is that ok? then you can update again when you have attached to the fluid wiki
2015-08-31T17:06:05 <danayo> for sure, thanks
2015-08-31T17:22:39 <danayo> simonjb: I upload the files to GPII wiki, but can\'t figure out how to link to them!
2015-08-31T17:23:03 <danayo> you can see my attempt on the wiki page :\\
2015-08-31T17:23:41 <simonjb> I\'ll take a look danayo
2015-08-31T17:23:45 <danayo> thanks :)
2015-08-31T17:30:51 <simonjb> danayo: I\'ve updated the links -- I made the links using the "WikiTextEditor" rather than the rich text one
2015-08-31T17:31:06 <simonjb> you can switch when you edit using a link above the editor
2015-08-31T17:31:38 <danayo> could you tell me how you did it simonjb? I tried that too, but couldn\'t figure out where to input file link in the links window
2015-08-31T17:32:07 <danayo> oh, wait, I see
2015-08-31T17:32:19 <danayo> it was also the underscores that were missing
2015-08-31T17:33:04 <simonjb> danayo: https://wiki.gpii.net/index.php?title=Security_Dashboard&type=revision&diff=14090&oldid=14083

2015-08-31T17:52:12 <colinclark> such lush string synths, danayo
2015-08-31T17:52:22 <danayo> :)
2015-08-31T17:52:52 <danayo> thought I\'d try to get a sample up there, but definitely need to play around a lot more colinclark!
2015-08-31T17:53:25 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I really like to the right aligned version!
2015-08-31T17:53:45 <colinclark> It\xe2\x80\x99s hugely useful to actually hear them
2015-08-31T17:53:48 <danayo> cool
2015-08-31T17:53:49 <danayo> yes
2015-08-31T17:53:53 <colinclark> makes the idea of \xe2\x80\x9cjustification\xe2\x80\x9d much less abstract
2015-08-31T17:53:55 <danayo> I\'ll send it all to list shorty
2015-08-31T17:53:58 <danayo> shortly!
2015-08-31T17:54:09 <colinclark> danayo: ARE YOU CALLING ME SHORT?
2015-08-31T17:54:15 <danayo> hahahah NO!!!
2015-08-31T17:54:41 <colinclark> it seems pretty clear from listening to them all that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to hear each voice\xe2\x80\x99s entrance point
2015-08-31T17:55:04 <colinclark> with the left-justified version, all the instruments just form a \xe2\x80\x9cgestalt,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning they sound like one single sound
2015-08-31T17:55:33 <colinclark> whereas when you hear each voice additively, you can much more easily hear them as separate
2015-08-31T17:56:36 <danayo> definitely colinclark
2015-08-31T17:57:31 <danayo> I\'d like to play with different sounds to see what works best
2015-08-31T17:57:42 <danayo> the single instrument vs. different ones for example
2015-08-31T17:58:02 <danayo> I\'m wondering how much the ascending scale helps or hinders
2015-08-31T17:58:15 <danayo> etc
2015-08-31T17:59:25 <danayo> colinclark ^
2015-08-31T18:00:47 <colinclark> danayo: I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to use anything and everything we can to ensure each individual voice sounds, well, individual
2015-08-31T18:00:52 <colinclark> So pitch is crucial
2015-08-31T18:01:17 <danayo> yes
2015-08-31T18:01:21 <colinclark> timbre (i.e. which type of instrument it sounds like and what kinds of overtones it contains) also
2015-08-31T18:01:35 <colinclark> other even more distinct qualties
2015-08-31T18:01:42 <colinclark> such as a drone vs. percussive attacks
2015-08-31T18:02:33 <danayo> yeah, I also tried this with some synth beat-type tracks
2015-08-31T18:02:43 <danayo> I need to fix them up and I\'ll post those too
2015-08-31T18:03:00 <danayo> they are a bit overwhelming
2015-08-31T18:03:27 <danayo> like a rave gone bad
2015-08-31T18:03:50 <danayo> or good maybe :)
