2015-11-02T20:25:47 <alanharnum> interesting site in light of the "compare open source projects" UIs we\'ve been discussing: https://www.staticgen.com/
2015-11-02T20:28:06 <alanharnum> avtar danayo sepidehshahi in particular ^
2015-11-02T20:29:56 <sepidehshahi> very cool alanharnum!
2015-11-02T20:41:56 <sepidehshahi> I tried to see how voice over works with each project\xe2\x80\x99s graphs. It just skips them and they are not mentioned at all\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-02T20:45:19 <alanharnum> doesn\'t surprise me
2015-11-02T20:45:45 <alanharnum> but obviously not something we want to replicate :)
2015-11-02T20:46:27 <alanharnum> it\'s interesting (in light of our conversations about what matters being context-specific) to see what they\'ve identified as important for comparing static site generators
2015-11-02T20:46:43 <alanharnum> which along with what\'s extracted from GitHub, is the language, template language, and license
2015-11-02T20:51:10 <danayo> interesting to see what they have chosen to extract from Github as well alanharnum sepidehshahi - where do the stars come from - people favourite the projects on Github?
2015-11-02T20:51:33 <alanharnum> danayo: stars are like bookmarks / favourites, basically, yeah
2015-11-02T20:51:38 <alanharnum> within the context of GitHub
2015-11-02T20:51:48 <alanharnum> https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars/
2015-11-02T20:52:06 <alanharnum> it\'s basically a combination of a bookmark and a +1/Facebook like
2015-11-02T20:52:24 <danayo> thanks alanharnum
2015-11-02T20:55:09 <danayo> and I was trying to figure out the red/green/black numbers - obviously green/red is better/worse - but assume black is neutral? wondering why change in number of issues is always black ?

2015-11-02T20:56:13 <colinclark> I guess it\'s really a popularity comparison
2015-11-02T20:56:39 <colinclark> Starring a project is a way to sort of keep track of it and express a like for it, as alanharnum said
2015-11-02T20:56:46 <colinclark> forks often play a similar role
2015-11-02T20:57:06 <colinclark> arguably they might express the number of people who are actively working on it
2015-11-02T20:57:15 <colinclark> in practice, though, I\'ve noticed that people often fork a repository simply because they thing it\'s cool
