2015-09-29T16:28:03 <cindyli> danayo: in the wireframe for integrating the first discovery tool and the preferences server - https://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/28344554/FD%20tool%20congrats%20and%20token%20copy.pdf?version=2&modificationDate=1442948727163&api=v2, the last pages indicates what to do with the error message:
2015-09-29T16:28:07 <cindyli> "to appear in token eld in the
2015-09-29T16:28:07 <cindyli> event that a token cannot be generated for any

2015-09-29T16:28:44 <cindyli> "Sorry, a token could not be generated at this time."
2015-09-29T16:29:15 <cindyli> so, the error message should appear inside the token field?
2015-09-29T16:29:24 <danayo> that\'s right cindyli
2015-09-29T16:29:51 <cindyli> danayo: inside the input box?
2015-09-29T16:30:33 <cindyli> shall I adjust the size of the token input field to accommodate this message?
2015-09-29T16:31:22 <danayo> yes cindyli if it can be responsive that would be great, but if not it\'ll have to be big enough to fit
2015-09-29T16:31:58 <cindyli> ok
