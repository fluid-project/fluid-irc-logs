2015-08-26T15:25:07 <danayo> sepidehshahi, murilocrivellari: I just had a listen to the sonification sample you linked to yesterday sepi, and I'm confused as to why I hear overlapping sounds (not referring to the total market share sound in the background, but other individual sounds that seem to overlap). what's happening there?
2015-08-26T15:29:15 <sepidehshahi> danayo: that\xe2\x80\x99s the sketch I talked about during our meeting. So, we decided to split each segment into multiple pieces and speard them along the entire piece. Thus, you may hear the same sound repeating several times. A sound that you here more often and for longer periods represents the largest segment and the one heard least frequently and with shortest duration is the smallest piece. As I said, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a successful attempt. We may be
2015-08-26T15:29:15 <sepidehshahi> get better results with proper sound design.
