b'2015-08-20T20:28:32 <colinclark> this track is nice, but it\'s probably an acquired taste thing ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcxH6uB0STg&index=1&list=PLE046958DA3B4BA96
2015-08-20T20:29:44 <colinclark> but you can hear, even just from the sound design perspective, how each of the elements in the track is easily "trackable" as a distinct element--piano, bass, clicky things, drone--they all have their own adible "space" carved out for them
2015-08-20T20:34:58 <murilocrivellari> colinclark: wow, that\'s amazing! I wonder if we could do something like that (but obviously much shorter in duration) to express the "glimpse" experience of a pie chart
2015-08-20T20:35:11 <colinclark> it\'s worth trying
