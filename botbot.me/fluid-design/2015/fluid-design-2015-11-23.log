2015-11-23T21:20:01 <danayo> np, thank you!
2015-11-23T21:20:40 <cindyli> danayo: one more question, is the background color for the hover state on "add service" white?
2015-11-23T21:20:53 <cindyli> it looks like a light grey
2015-11-23T21:21:09 <cindyli> if so, do you have the color code for it?
2015-11-23T21:22:49 <danayo> it\'s a light grey cindyli f2f2f2 ... but actually I think white would be better
2015-11-23T21:23:09 <cindyli> ok, danayo, will use white
2015-11-23T21:23:13 <danayo> thanks
