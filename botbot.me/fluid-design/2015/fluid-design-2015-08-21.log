2015-08-21T19:19:27 <cindyli> murilocrivellari: the design for the chart authoring tool on the floe iteration plan wiki page is for tab order. where can i find the design of tool work flow. it was on that page before
2015-08-21T19:20:59 <murilocrivellari> sorry, cindyli, it seems like it has been replaced. I'll upload that again and send you a link

2015-08-21T19:21:15 <cindyli> thanks, murilocrivellari
2015-08-21T19:34:23 <murilocrivellari> here's the link cindyli https://www.dropbox.com/s/1jazkhvjulpz7zt/CA%20Tool%20%5BFlow%5D.pdf?dl=0
2015-08-21T19:34:33 <cindyli> thanks murilocrivellari
2015-08-21T19:37:02 <murilocrivellari> cindyli: this is a previous version of the tool, since I'm still working on a flow for the new version. Also, I had a chat with sepidehshahi earlier today, and we decided to change the keyboard interaction for the pie chart: the user would just tab to it and use the arrow keys, so they don't have to click enter
2015-08-21T19:39:30 <cindyli> good to know the new progress, murilocrivellari, can you add it into this wiki page - https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Chart+Interactions
2015-08-21T19:40:07 <cindyli> murilocrivellari: can you also review whatever on that page. this was from our last discussion about the chart interaction. there might be things you have changed
2015-08-21T19:40:43 <murilocrivellari> cindyli: absolutely! will do
