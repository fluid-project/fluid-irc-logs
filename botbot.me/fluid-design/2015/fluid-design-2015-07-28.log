2015-07-28T16:51:57 <colinclark> sepideh: I\'ve got a 3 pm meeting, and am in one now at home, but I\'m hoping I\'ll have a window of 30 minutes or so between meetings
2015-07-28T16:52:09 <colinclark> would you like chat for a bit when I get into the office
2015-07-28T16:52:11 <colinclark> ?
2015-07-28T16:52:31 <sepideh> that sounds great colinclark
2015-07-28T16:52:40 <colinclark> I\'ve been reading the change-tracked comments that Till put into the document itself
2015-07-28T16:52:45 <colinclark> and it\'s interesting
2015-07-28T16:52:54 <colinclark> there is a lot more substance to the comments in the document
2015-07-28T16:53:53 <sepideh> yes, he has a point and I agree with many of his comments. I am not sure how we can update the report based on the time frame we have
2015-07-28T16:54:05 <colinclark> time is mutable :)
2015-07-28T16:54:12 <colinclark> in contrast to the sort of meandering deferral of responsibility in the body of his email
2015-07-28T16:54:22 <sepideh> :)
2015-07-28T16:54:28 <colinclark> he has some interesting points, some of which boil down to terminology
2015-07-28T16:54:40 <sepideh> exactly..
2015-07-28T16:54:59 <colinclark> some of which might require us to do a bit of work elaborating a distinction between "the ultimate vision" and "the stuff we will build for the funded project"
2015-07-28T16:55:53 <sepideh> great ida. Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about those parts very briefly when you get to the office. Thanks a lot Colin
