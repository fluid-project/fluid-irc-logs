b'2015-11-25T22:29:26 <danayo> right, yeah, I\'m super-thoughtful about that idea of building a model from different perspectives
2015-11-25T22:29:46 <danayo> for non-sighted users
2015-11-25T22:31:41 <danayo> I was about to write that there is such an opportunity to provide alternative perspectives with audio that we can\'t do with visuals but then I realised the same could be done with visuals
2015-11-25T22:32:20 <danayo> we just don\'t typically do it - allowing a user to rearrange a visual UI to their liking I mean
2015-11-25T22:32:35 <danayo> it\'s not exactly the same though, is it?
2015-11-25T22:32:52 <danayo> because with the visual you get to see everything at once, or at least most things
2015-11-25T22:33:01 <danayo> hmmmmm
2015-11-25T22:33:14 <danayo> this is so interesting
2015-11-25T22:33:45 <colinclark> yes super interesting
2015-11-25T22:33:58 <danayo> I\'m imagining a "query-able" visual UI
2015-11-25T22:34:06 <danayo> where parts are hidden from view
2015-11-25T22:34:24 <colinclark> I guess 3D design software has lots of examples of this
2015-11-25T22:34:35 <colinclark> where you look at an object from a particular perspective or camera view
2015-11-25T22:34:50 <colinclark> or Excel, which lets you see cells, or see graphs
2015-11-25T22:34:58 <danayo> true
2015-11-25T22:35:32 <colinclark> these aren\'t very good examples, I realize
2015-11-25T22:35:34 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-25T22:36:53 <danayo> i think it\'s helpful
2015-11-25T22:37:02 <danayo> when you said 3D design software
2015-11-25T22:37:16 <danayo> I was only thinking of show/hide toolbars feature
2015-11-25T22:37:25 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-25T22:37:31 <danayo> not different views of an object or of data
2015-11-25T22:37:35 <colinclark> right
2015-11-25T22:37:52 <colinclark> Smalltalk was the first to make this distinction
2015-11-25T22:37:58 <colinclark> which lives today in Infusion in a different form
2015-11-25T22:38:10 <colinclark> that you have a "model" which you can have very different perspectives on (views)
2015-11-25T22:39:18 <colinclark> in practice so many pieces of software just have one view
2015-11-25T22:39:39 <colinclark> but then a screen reader ends up becoming a kind of second-class "view"
2015-11-25T22:39:53 <colinclark> where it can\'t see the model, but it can provide alternative views of the built-in view
2015-11-25T22:40:39 <danayo> hmm...doesn\'t a screen-reader see the model in the sense that it\'s based on the markup structure?
2015-11-25T22:41:19 <colinclark> Web pages are a bit of an exception
2015-11-25T22:41:26 <colinclark> but only partially so
2015-11-25T22:41:28 <danayo> ah
2015-11-25T22:41:43 <colinclark> with a desktop application, a screen reader only sees what\'s in the "view hierarchy" of the operating system
2015-11-25T22:41:54 <colinclark> it can only see windows, panels, buttons, toolsbars, text
2015-11-25T22:42:01 <danayo> I see
2015-11-25T22:42:22 <colinclark> What ARIA does is actually expose parts of a web page to that operating system view hiearchy
2015-11-25T22:42:40 <colinclark> so if you have a <div> that is actually a toolbar, you give it a role atttibute of "toolbar"
2015-11-25T22:42:54 <colinclark> and behind the scenes, the browser will expose that as a native OS toolbar component
2015-11-25T22:43:09 <colinclark> Screen readers do, though, have the ability to access page markup too
2015-11-25T22:43:18 <danayo> right
2015-11-25T22:43:26 <colinclark> but you can think of HTML still as a kind of view
2015-11-25T22:43:32 <colinclark> it\'s a much more expressive one, potentially
2015-11-25T22:43:43 <colinclark> since, first, it\'s shared
2015-11-25T22:43:56 <colinclark> something like UI Options can actually go in there and change an application\'s view
2015-11-25T22:44:00 <colinclark> our Simplify enactor does this
2015-11-25T22:44:09 <danayo> yes
2015-11-25T22:44:14 <colinclark> it actively goes in and strips out or hides things that aren\'t inside a < main > tag
2015-11-25T22:44:42 <colinclark> but I guess today\'s screenreaders don\'t have the same power that an application\'s views do
2015-11-25T22:44:58 <colinclark> to access "the data" and totally re-organize or represent it
2015-11-25T22:45:07 <danayo> right. they\'re still limited by the markup
2015-11-25T22:45:10 <colinclark> yup
2015-11-25T22:45:18 <colinclark> but imagine an AT that understood the data
2015-11-25T22:45:24 <colinclark> and its relationships with other data
2015-11-25T22:45:32 <colinclark> and all the actions that were bound to all the buttons
2015-11-25T22:45:44 <colinclark> and what parts of the data those actions touched and modified
2015-11-25T22:45:44 <danayo> that would be something !
2015-11-25T22:46:11 <colinclark> it sure would
2015-11-25T22:46:24 <colinclark> For one of Jutta\'s classes, I gave a presentation where I made all my slides in HTML
2015-11-25T22:46:32 <colinclark> and I built a little screenreader into one of the slides
2015-11-25T22:46:53 <colinclark> it wasn\'t what we\'re talking about here, but it was a way to talk about the potential of ATs "in" the software
2015-11-25T22:47:05 <danayo> nice
2015-11-25T22:47:08 <colinclark> as opposed to bolted on via some limited API
2015-11-25T22:47:16 <danayo> right
2015-11-25T22:47:57 <danayo> i\'m still a bit confused about smalltalk - how does it provide different views?

2015-11-25T22:02:00 <danayo> other than the timeline sounds, there\'s no way to orient yourself in the space or know what\'s going on without the visuals

2015-11-25T22:16:06 * anastasiac has quit
2015-11-25T22:17:13 <colinclark> It\'s interesting also the way it tries to support navigating across two different axes
2015-11-25T22:17:16 <colinclark> time and theme
2015-11-25T22:17:25 <danayo> :) I saw some of his work at the Brooklyn Museum once
2015-11-25T22:18:44 <danayo> yeah, I guess the axes are country and time, and you can select a theme subset
2015-11-25T22:19:02 <danayo> the connections between the blobs seem to be arbitrary
2015-11-25T22:19:18 <danayo> or at least, when you pick a theme, all the blobs get connected
2015-11-25T22:20:00 * gtirloni has quit
2015-11-25T22:21:39 <colinclark> there\'s something slightly nerve-wrackingly "progressionist" about the connections
2015-11-25T22:21:45 <colinclark> they look hot, for sure
2015-11-25T22:22:09 <colinclark> but one shouldn\'t underestimate the disconnections between, say, Africa and Europe when it comes to art history
2015-11-25T22:22:48 <colinclark> dot colour is the that third axis, theme
2015-11-25T22:23:28 <danayo> region, no?
2015-11-25T22:23:40 <colinclark> I guess you\'re rigth
2015-11-25T22:23:51 <colinclark> i misread this at first
2015-11-25T22:23:57 <colinclark> theme is just a highlight
2015-11-25T22:24:04 <colinclark> there\'s something wonderfully haptic about moving with the arrow keys and hearing the pings as you move by them
2015-11-25T22:24:27 <danayo> the pings are so nice!
2015-11-25T22:24:32 <colinclark> It was interesting to hear Emily talk about her PhET user testing session recently
2015-11-25T22:24:43 <danayo> I just noticed the differnet shades of dots
2015-11-25T22:24:55 <colinclark> where the user continually described a spatial mental model as she was interacting with it
2015-11-25T22:25:09 <colinclark> and the model sort of grew progressively based on how she chose to "view" a page
2015-11-25T22:25:18 <danayo> that sounds really interesting colinclark
2015-11-25T22:25:23 <colinclark> first getting a sense of the page\'s "overall shape" using things like pulling up a list of all headings
2015-11-25T22:25:48 <colinclark> and then also some sense of spatiality based on tab order, what seems to be proximate to other things, etc.
2015-11-25T22:26:23 <colinclark> but it\'s interesting to think about how these different "layers" we can provide help paint a mental picture for a user who can\'t see the interface
2015-11-25T22:26:58 <colinclark> we really need lots of different forms of alternatives, and the choice to experience one form or layer, then another, and so on
2015-11-25T22:27:13 <danayo> yes
2015-11-25T22:27:24 <colinclark> So the pings here, along with the arrow keys, do provide a more expanded sense of space, I imagine
2015-11-25T22:27:34 <colinclark> especially if there were ways to, say, query all the dates
2015-11-25T22:27:39 <colinclark> or the date lines
2015-11-25T22:27:44 <colinclark> and query all the themes
2015-11-25T22:27:46 <colinclark> all the countries
2015-11-25T22:27:53 <colinclark> and so forth
2015-11-25T22:27:56 <colinclark> I use the term "query" abstractly
2015-11-25T22:28:42 <colinclark> screen reader users almost never just tab through a page
2015-11-25T22:28:56 <colinclark> they get an overview via these "alternative views" of a page first
2015-11-25T22:29:00 <colinclark> such as a list of headings
2015-11-25T22:29:15 <colinclark> whereas a user who is sighted but uses the keyboard will probably do more tabbing
2015-11-25T22:29:25 <colinclark> because they can access the spatiality of the page directly
