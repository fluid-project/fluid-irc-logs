2015-06-22T19:16:54 <murilocrivellari> hey danayo, would you please take a look at this file when you have the time? https://www.dropbox.com/s/mddmnfsqjy7t599/CA%20Tool%20%5Bsimplified%5D.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-22T19:19:03 <danayo> will do murilocrivellari
2015-06-22T19:19:41 <murilocrivellari> danayo: thanks a lot!
2015-06-22T19:37:23 <danayo> murilocrivellari: it looks great. a couple of comments
2015-06-22T19:37:45 <danayo> one is that we should try to avoid large blocks of italicized text, as it can be difficult to read for some
2015-06-22T19:37:48 <danayo> there is some info here http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/
2015-06-22T19:37:57 <danayo> and here http://uxmovement.com/content/6-surprising-bad-practices-that-hurt-dyslexic-users/
2015-06-22T19:38:36 <danayo> and one other comment - the Total value and % still look like text entry fields
2015-06-22T19:38:43 <danayo> I think we agreed they would not be, right?
2015-06-22T19:39:07 <danayo> Maybe the total text could just show up once a user makes an entry
2015-06-22T19:39:29 <murilocrivellari> danayo: that's a very good idea
2015-06-22T19:40:24 <cindyli> danayo: do you have a few minutes to chat?
2015-06-22T19:40:32 <murilocrivellari> yes
2015-06-22T19:40:35 <cindyli> vidyo?
2015-06-22T19:40:37 <cindyli> calling u
2015-06-22T19:41:05 <murilocrivellari> danayo: thanks a lot, I'll work on the modifications
2015-06-22T19:47:49 <danayo> also murilocrivellari - I want to check in with michelled again when she's back online about the textures - looking at it again, i'm worried that if we just have the grey scale it won't be visible to many users - maybe that's ok for our first pass but I wonder if it wouldn't be the same amount of work to implement textures instead. Justin_o do you have any thoughts on this?
2015-06-22T19:48:53 <Justin_o> danayo: it's probably easier to do just colours but I'd guess it won't be much more work to do the textures instead.
2015-06-22T19:50:02 <danayo> ok thanks Justin_o. let's get michelled's opinion when we can
2015-06-22T19:51:08 <murilocrivellari> thanks again for the feedback, danayo
2015-06-22T19:51:21 <danayo> you're welcome murilocrivellari!
2015-06-22T19:52:09 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, sounds good.. she should be back online tomorrow
2015-06-22T19:52:16 <danayo> ok
