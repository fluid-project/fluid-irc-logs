2015-08-14T17:36:16 <colinclark> sepidehshahi and murilocrivellari, did you hear about 18F\'s design method cards? https://methods.18f.gov/
2015-08-14T17:36:38 <colinclark> it\'s interesting to see how many of the techniques were documented also in our Design Handbook, five or six years ago
2015-08-14T17:37:02 <colinclark> but what\'s nice about them is that they\'re really clearly articulated--very succinct in terms of what each technique\'s strengths are
2015-08-14T17:38:53 <colinclark> And interestingly, they manage all their methods documentation as an open source project: https://github.com/18F/methods
2015-08-14T17:39:10 <sepidehshahi> very very interesting!
2015-08-14T17:39:40 <colinclark> The methods themselves are pretty familiar
2015-08-14T17:39:53 <colinclark> but it is an interesting way to present them and focus people\'s attention on them
2015-08-14T17:43:17 <sepidehshahi> exactly! they are not saying anything new, they have just packaged content in a simple format that non-designers can easily relate to. Other top design firms have similar products as well, but those are not open source\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-08-14T17:43:45 <sepidehshahi> thanks for sharing colinclark
2015-08-14T17:44:02 <colinclark> yup
2015-08-14T17:44:21 <colinclark> I\'d be interesting to think about some of the techniques in our Inclusive Learning Handbook from this perspective
2015-08-14T17:44:32 <colinclark> clear, succinct descriptions of accessibility techniques and when to use them
2015-08-14T17:44:39 <colinclark> "Sonification"
2015-08-14T17:44:47 <colinclark> "Keyboard Navigation"
2015-08-14T17:44:53 <colinclark> "User States and Contexts"
2015-08-14T17:44:54 <colinclark> :)
2015-08-14T17:45:23 <colinclark> patterns of inclusion, so to speak
2015-08-14T17:47:02 <alanharnum> 18f <3
2015-08-14T17:47:15 <alanharnum> i can\'t wait until 10 years or so from now when the Canadian government brings in an equivalent
2015-08-14T18:12:05 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: this is something we should totally work on in the future. providing simple, clear a11y tool kits/card decks/methods.
2015-08-14T18:12:37 <sepidehshahi> I remember someone had asked Jess_ for simple accessibility guidelines for their organization instead of going through pages and pages of instructions.
2015-08-14T18:14:01 <Jess_> yep, anastasiac and i were going to put JTs short-n-simple accessibility tips for the Lumen folks into our wiki and we were gonna use it as a starting point. THe folks at BC Campus were interested in contributing too

2015-08-14T18:15:13 <Jess_> can\xe2\x80\x99t remember, but i think the wiki page might have been created or drafted by anastasiac
2015-08-14T18:28:27 <murilocrivellari> colinclark, sepidehshahi it reminds me of the Method Cards from IDEO (http://www.ideo.com/work/method-cards), which is an actual deck containing simple design techniques. This is a fast and easy way to deliver your message :)
2015-08-14T18:30:26 <sepidehshahi> yes! and they have recently launched an online version of it: http://www.designkit.org/methods
2015-08-14T18:32:26 <murilocrivellari> sepidehshahi: I didn\'t know about the online version. That\'s awesome!
2015-08-14T18:36:24 <Jess_> murilocrivellari: if you sign up on that page, they send you friendly emails with cool annoucements
2015-08-14T18:37:58 <murilocrivellari> Jess_: cool! signing up just now :)
