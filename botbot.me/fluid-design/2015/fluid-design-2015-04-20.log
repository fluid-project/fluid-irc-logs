2015-04-20T16:54:46 <danaayotte> lliskovoi, sepideh, jhung I deleted some files from dropbox (particularly the large screencast files and a few others) - there should be more room in there now for us to work
2015-04-20T16:55:16 <sepideh> great, thanks danaayotte:)

2015-04-20T21:36:29 <sepideh> Hi colinclark, what should I change the project name to?
2015-04-20T21:36:38 <colinclark> hey sepideh!
2015-04-20T21:36:40 <colinclark> How\'s it going?
2015-04-20T21:36:47 <colinclark> The dashboard mockup looks really nice
2015-04-20T21:37:04 <colinclark> The politics are sort of funny about Fluid in Prosperity4All
2015-04-20T21:37:18 <colinclark> We are probably the most mature project amongst the many participating technologies
2015-04-20T21:37:25 <sepideh> I need to work more on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a draft, but I hope it works for your presentation
2015-04-20T21:37:27 <danaayotte> hello sepideh, what was the dashboard work that michelled mentioned at standup? I missed what she said and was curious
2015-04-20T21:37:38 <colinclark> and also perhaps the one with the most visible separate community
2015-04-20T21:38:04 <colinclark> sometimes politically it is good for us to show other peoples\' stuff, and this seems like a good case
2015-04-20T21:38:17 <sepideh> danaayotte here is the link:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ho3oah1l5xbjq33/DSpace%20Dashboard.pdf?dl=0
2015-04-20T21:38:19 <colinclark> danaayotte: I asked sepideh to create a quick mockup for my slides at the review this week
2015-04-20T21:38:33 <colinclark> of what a dashboard might look like in the Developer Space
2015-04-20T21:38:50 <colinclark> which shows various kinds of "metrics" from the Prosperity4All Quality Infrastructure
2015-04-20T21:39:04 <colinclark> Such as how tested a component is, how active it is, etc.
2015-04-20T21:39:37 <colinclark> It would be interesting to think about what the accessibility metrics might be like
2015-04-20T21:39:41 <avtar> colinclark: as far as i know we don\'t yet how to evaluate how accessible a desktop app might be but perhaps for this mockup do you think the accessibility link in should be presented as a grade (A, B, etc)?
2015-04-20T21:39:50 <danaayotte> thanks colinclark sepideh
2015-04-20T21:39:55 <avtar> ah so slow today
2015-04-20T21:40:07 <colinclark> It could be represented as WCAG 2.0 compliance, avtar
2015-04-20T21:40:20 <colinclark> perhaps a percentage of WCAG 2.0 A, AA, and AAA
2015-04-20T21:40:26 <avtar> ah good idea
2015-04-20T21:40:39 <colinclark> http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/
2015-04-20T21:40:55 <colinclark> We can set aside the rather massive question of how we\'d actually measure this
2015-04-20T21:41:02 <colinclark> Static HTML analysis tools can do a lot
2015-04-20T21:41:09 <colinclark> but of course most software isn\'t static HTML anymore
2015-04-20T21:42:28 <sepideh> That sounds good, so I can remove the accessibility button and add a collumn to the table for Accessibility and have A, AA and AAA grades.
2015-04-20T21:42:53 <colinclark> that seems like a cool idea, yes
2015-04-20T21:43:05 <colinclark> I think it would have to be a percentage towards those rating
2015-04-20T21:43:20 <colinclark> or something like that
2015-04-20T21:43:22 <colinclark> if this makes sense
2015-04-20T21:43:42 <colinclark> I wonder also if it\'s possible to imagine an "at a glance" version of this dashboard...
2015-04-20T21:44:08 <colinclark> something that just with a few points and icons summarizes test coverage, activity, accessibility, etc.
2015-04-20T21:44:22 <colinclark> I really dig this screen, and it\'s kind of like the "expanded view"
2015-04-20T21:44:35 <colinclark> but I know it\'s getting late--that could wait until tomorrow if you have some time
2015-04-20T21:49:04 <sepideh> Let me see what I can do:) I will try to have something for you later tonight.
2015-04-20T21:49:38 <danaayotte> it\'s looking good sepideh!  do the red bars indicate failed tests?
2015-04-20T21:49:51 <sepideh> yes
2015-04-20T21:50:02 <sepideh> and the green bars indicate passed
2015-04-20T21:50:31 <sepideh> do you think that I should label them?
2015-04-20T21:53:15 <danaayotte> perhaps you could visually link it back to the Failed and Passed count at the top somehow
2015-04-20T21:53:55 <danaayotte> I don\'t know if it\'s necessary - it wasn\'t immediately obvious to me but after I stared at it for a while I figured that must be what it means
2015-04-20T21:53:59 <danaayotte> sepideh ^
2015-04-20T21:55:16 <sepideh> cool, that\xe2\x80\x99s good idea. thanks danaayotte
2015-04-20T21:55:26 <danaayotte> at first i thought it might relate to the coloured arrows
