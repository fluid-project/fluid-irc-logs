2015-08-27T14:18:06 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, there are several interesting articles about AT context in the Euroe in this book https://books.google.ca/books?id=eNpiStR-kcYC&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=european+commission%2Bsurvey%2Bassistive+technology&source=bl&ots=IWHKPiMoVH&sig=h7leJs-UYtSvWK7Lyu_nshY7VRQ&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true
2015-08-27T14:24:05 <jessm> sepidehshahi: it\xe2\x80\x99ll be good to have these articles as references for the deliverables
2015-08-27T14:24:25 <sepidehshahi> absolutely.
2015-08-27T14:24:43 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2015-08-27T14:30:48 <jessm> murilocrivellari: looks amazing on mobile too
2015-08-27T14:39:00 * anastasiac has quit
2015-08-27T14:39:35 <murilocrivellari> jessm: cool! very interesting, indeed. I love the visual representations as well
2015-08-27T14:42:33 <jessm> murilocrivellari: it\xe2\x80\x99s curious, they don\xe2\x80\x99t say at the end who did the visualizations
2015-08-27T14:46:32 <murilocrivellari> jessm: I suspect the visualizations were not part of the project, primarily. That is, it was added just for the video. In our case, however, I'd like to see something like that when playing around with the sonic part (as a creator)
2015-08-27T14:47:04 <jessm> i think you\xe2\x80\x99re right
2015-08-27T14:48:26 <jessm> and murilocrivellari it looks like a lot of work went into it \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty amazing
2015-08-27T14:50:44 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-08-27T14:50:45 <murilocrivellari> jessm: absolutely! Diplo is really good, I love his music. I'm not very into Skrillex, but this is really impressive
2015-08-27T14:54:25 <jessm> murilocrivellari: it seems that they took some of the tracks from a digital music program and made them vertical, gave them some more graphical elements and split them out in a really nice way

2015-08-27T15:46:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-27T15:46:49 <danayo> for sure murilocrivellari - i'll try to get them into some kind of consumable form today

2015-08-27T15:47:05 <murilocrivellari> danayo: awesome, thanks :)
2015-08-27T15:54:29 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I can't find a date on that European AT doc you sent - do you know when it was published?
2015-08-27T15:54:56 <sepidehshahi> I was looking for the date as well\xe2\x80\xa6 but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it
2015-08-27T15:56:24 <danayo> looks like it's 1995 sepidehshahi
2015-08-27T15:56:31 <danayo> http://www.amazon.com/European-Context-Assistive-Technology-Research/dp/9051992203
2015-08-27T15:56:57 <sepidehshahi> almost 20 years!! but the contet seems very relevant
2015-08-27T15:57:16 <danayo> yeah, we should just be cautious - some of the info might be out of date
2015-08-27T15:57:19 <sepidehshahi> it means AT industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed that much since 1995:)
2015-08-27T15:57:37 <danayo> that is also probably true!
2015-08-27T15:58:53 <sepidehshahi> Sure
2015-08-27T16:01:58 <sepidehshahi> Here is nice list: http://www.iospress.nl/bookserie/assistive-technology-research-series/ We may be able to find some of those titles in the Google Books
2015-08-27T16:02:04 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^

2015-08-27T16:38:07 <danayo> np
2015-08-27T16:39:13 <danayo> the cover looked a bit old school (= awesome) so I thought I'd check

2015-08-27T18:03:01 <danayo> no worries
2015-08-27T18:03:40 <simonjb> danayo: we could add to the GPII wiki and link from https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Security_Dashboard
2015-08-27T18:03:53 <danayo> ok, sounds good
2015-08-27T18:03:58 <simonjb> thanks!
2015-08-27T18:05:33 <colinclark> hey daner
2015-08-27T18:05:38 <danayo> hi conlinclark
2015-08-27T18:05:40 <colinclark> do you have any STUFF for today\xe2\x80\x99s crit?
2015-08-27T18:05:44 <colinclark> or shall we skip a week?
2015-08-27T18:05:52 <colinclark> everyone else I talked to said that they had NO STUFF
2015-08-27T18:06:00 <danayo> no stuff!
2015-08-27T18:06:02 <danayo> hmmm
2015-08-27T18:06:27 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m fine either way\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a working meeting, so when no one has new stuff, we just keep working and skip it
2015-08-27T18:06:35 <colinclark> and whenever people have stuff, we talk about stuff
2015-08-27T18:06:46 <simonjb> danayo: too soon for the UIO stuff?
2015-08-27T18:06:56 <colinclark> or thew new sonifications?
2015-08-27T18:07:07 <danayo> yeah...they're both a bit undercooked
2015-08-27T18:07:14 <simonjb> np :)
2015-08-27T18:08:29 <danayo> simonjb do you think it would be useful to walk through the UIO privacy STUFF?
2015-08-27T18:09:14 <simonjb> danayo: as a group in the crit or just the 2 of us? YES to both
2015-08-27T18:09:26 <colinclark> :)
2015-08-27T18:09:42 <danayo> I meant as a group, but definitely we two ned to discuss
2015-08-27T18:10:12 <colinclark> if you feel up for it danayo, let\xe2\x80\x99s do a quick one of the UIO STUFF
2015-08-27T18:10:16 <colinclark> short crit today
2015-08-27T18:10:24 <simonjb> we could try as a group and see how it goes
