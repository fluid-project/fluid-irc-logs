2015-10-15T16:43:37 <danayo> Justin_o, what was the other design repository you created (in addition to sonification)?
2015-10-15T16:46:03 <Justin_o> danayo: https://github.com/fluid-project/security-design
2015-10-15T16:46:19 <danayo> ah thanks
2015-10-15T16:46:21 <Justin_o> danayo: we can change those if you like too
2015-10-15T16:46:29 <danayo> that\'s fine
2015-10-15T16:47:33 <Justin_o> okay
2015-10-15T16:47:37 <danayo> Justin_o, the owner(s) of a repo have merge privileges (and no one else), right?
2015-10-15T16:48:37 <Justin_o> danayo: i guess it depends on what you mean by owners(s), what we do with our github space is to create teams and assign access rights to those teams.
2015-10-15T16:48:53 <Justin_o> danayo: i\'ve created a design team and gave the design team access to those repos
2015-10-15T16:49:09 <Justin_o> which i believe is just you and jhung right now
2015-10-15T16:50:11 <Justin_o> danayo: can you see this https://github.com/orgs/fluid-project/teams/designers

2015-10-15T16:54:59 <danayo> thanks Justin_o. If I create a repo, I become the "owner", right? And then as the owner I can assign merge privileges?

2015-10-15T17:04:09 <Justin_o> danayo: if you create a repository in your own github space yes, those work different that the fluid-project space which is an organization
2015-10-15T17:06:24 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-15T17:07:35 <danayo> oh ok, i see
2015-10-15T17:09:34 <danayo> Justin_o, sorry for all the questions and thanks! how do I create a new repo in the fluid-project space?
2015-10-15T17:10:42 <Justin_o> danayo: hmm.. i\'m not sure if you can. That\'s an interesting problem.
2015-10-15T17:11:14 <Justin_o> danayo: if you are just testing things out, you might want to start by creating one in your space. we can move it over latter if you want to keep it.. is the okay for now?
2015-10-15T17:12:20 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi - I was wondering if you think a git primer would be useful? (i.e. "git for Designers Who Are Not Dummies")
2015-10-15T17:13:11 <danayo> Justin_o that should be ok. so it\'s because I don\'t have the privileges/access to do that, right? just want to understand. sepidehshahi was going to create a deve space repo to try out
2015-10-15T17:13:31 <danayo> jhung, that would be great
2015-10-15T17:13:48 <sepidehshahi> I have made the repo and I was trying to upload some files in there right now.
2015-10-15T17:14:06 <sepidehshahi> Yes jhung it would be really helpful
2015-10-15T17:14:35 <Justin_o> sepidehshahi: sorry, i forgot to send you those git resources. Did you still want them, or would you prefer to wait for jhung\'s primer?
2015-10-15T17:15:20 <sepidehshahi> I can wait for the jhung primer, thx Justin_o
2015-10-15T17:15:27 <Justin_o> okay
2015-10-15T17:18:42 <Justin_o> danayo: in regards to your previous question, yes it\'s related to privileges
2015-10-15T17:19:52 <danayo> thanks Justin_o. i don\'t see any problem with creating repos in our own spaces and then moving them over. assuming they\'ll behave in the same way?
2015-10-15T17:20:20 <Justin_o> danayo: they should
2015-10-15T17:20:25 <danayo> cool

2015-10-15T19:29:19 <Justin_o> it\'s currently only in my space, when it is ready we can move it over to the fluid-project github space
2015-10-15T19:30:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool - FuNkY use of NPM SCRIPTZ : P
