2015-07-17T13:47:17 <Jess_> sepideh: how are things going?
2015-07-17T13:47:53 <sepideh> Good morning Jess_  my plan is to add the Visual TOC and the Chart of the deliverables to the report today.
2015-07-17T13:47:59 <Jess_> awesome
2015-07-17T13:48:19 <sepideh> I am trying to figure out how the table of deliverable fits with the new model approach
2015-07-17T13:48:20 <Jess_> I figure i\xe2\x80\x99ll start crawling through and first pass make some notes for what i think is missing, then connect with you, then start adding \xe2\x80\x94 sound ok?
2015-07-17T13:48:35 <sepideh> that sounds great! thanks a lot
2015-07-17T13:48:48 <Jess_> oh, tell me more about how the new model affects the table...
2015-07-17T13:48:51 <Jess_> what are you thinking?
