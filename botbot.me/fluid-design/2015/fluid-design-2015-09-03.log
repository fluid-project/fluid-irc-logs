2015-09-03T15:22:49 <danayo> sepidehshahi: regarding the survey, you were wondering if we should finalise them in Survey Monkey and not wait for feedback, is that right?
2015-09-03T15:23:34 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right, because i also need to make an excel sheet and send it out to translators
2015-09-03T15:24:05 <sepidehshahi> so, danayo  what do you think we should do?
2015-09-03T15:25:21 <danayo> right. I'm thinking we should wait for feedback (we're waiting on Vivien and Victor, is that right?). I'm just worried that we'll have to make more changes. What is the deadline for this?
2015-09-03T15:28:07 <danayo> and Vivien is back next week, is that right sepidehshahi?
2015-09-03T15:30:29 <sepidehshahi> Yes, we are waiting for feedback from Vivian and Kevin. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when she is back. We were planning to send out the surveys this week. But it seems that we need more time for translations and unifying the coverletter\xe2\x80\xa6

2015-09-03T18:30:43 <danayo> so strange anastasiac, I think Text Wrangler must have zapped those hyphens and apostrophes. thanks for catching it
2015-09-03T18:41:40 <danayo> guess I should check my diffs more carefully anastasiac :)
2015-09-03T18:41:54 <danayo> or I should say - I should check them
2015-09-03T18:41:59 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-09-03T18:46:24 <danayo> hey fluid-everyone: just realised the time - no crit today? or did I miss it?
