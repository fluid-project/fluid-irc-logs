2015-09-04T16:50:47 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find a way to make the tutorial less dense, easier to parse. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put a table near the bottom of page 5. Would you have a minute to have a look, and let me know what you think of this approach? Is it more clear? Does it \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d in with the narrative text acceptable? Does it help, or make things worse? etc...

2015-09-04T16:51:49 <anastasiac> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any changes to the actual text yet, jhung, just to the presentation
2015-09-04T16:51:51 <jhung> ok anastasiac. I'll take a look.
2015-09-04T16:51:54 <anastasiac> thanks
2015-09-04T16:58:09 <jhung> made a comment anastasiac
2015-09-04T16:58:17 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2015-09-04T16:58:23 <jhung> np
2015-09-04T16:59:44 <anastasiac> jhung, your comment seems to describe what I had before! I\xe2\x80\x99ve put it back \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0just ahead of the table (so now both versions are there). Is that kind of what you meant?
2015-09-04T17:01:42 <jhung> lol anastasiac, similar. I guess i'm thinking that the formatting can be tweaked to make it more readable.
2015-09-04T17:01:59 <anastasiac> what would you suggest, jhung?
2015-09-04T17:02:38 <jhung> I can put it in the doc anastasiac. Do I have editing permissions?
2015-09-04T17:02:58 <anastasiac> you should be able to \xe2\x80\x98suggest\xe2\x80\x99 edits, jhung
2015-09-04T17:03:05 <jhung> ok
