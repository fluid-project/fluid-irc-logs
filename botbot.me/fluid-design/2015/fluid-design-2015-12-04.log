2015-12-04T18:59:48 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: how cool is this description? thinking of P4A here https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/sculpting-evolution
2015-12-04T19:01:37 <sepidehshahi> really cool Jess_ !!!
2015-12-04T19:05:15 <sepidehshahi> this can be a great argument for 404 report. So, to some degree you can predict and provide an assessment criteria, however, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to predict all the unplanned interactions and directions the users in P4A ecosystem may take to be able to assess them.just thinking outloud\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-12-04T19:05:29 <Jess_> xactly
2015-12-04T19:05:55 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: this is a new field at MIT medialab \xe2\x80\x94 they just hired a guy who did his PhD on this \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re SOOOOOOO cutting edge :P
