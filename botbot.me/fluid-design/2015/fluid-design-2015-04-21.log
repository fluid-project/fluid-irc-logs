2015-04-21T14:25:50 <colinclark> morning, sepideh
2015-04-21T14:25:54 <colinclark> How\'s it going?
2015-04-21T14:26:21 <sepideh> Good morning colinclarck:) I am working on the at a glance view
2015-04-21T14:27:35 <sepideh> I\xe2\x80\x99m planning to have something ready for you before lunch time
2015-04-21T14:30:10 <colinclark> That\'s cool
2015-04-21T14:30:17 <danaayotte> colinclark I was just telling sepideh that I think it\'s looking great.
2015-04-21T14:30:20 <colinclark> The more I think about it, the more I think the accessibility metric is really problematic
2015-04-21T14:30:50 <danaayotte> one concern I had re accessibility was the use of red and green (alone) to convey % passed
2015-04-21T14:30:50 <colinclark> Me and Kasper have been looking at various automated accessibility evaluation tools
2015-04-21T14:30:58 <colinclark> yes, that\'s a good point, danaayotte
2015-04-21T14:31:06 <sepideh> I can remove for now, so you will get into no trouble for th ereview and then we will do more research and hopefully incorporate it in the future.
2015-04-21T14:31:17 <colinclark> most of these tools aren\'t particularly reliable
2015-04-21T14:31:18 <colinclark> We could either remove it or hedge it somehow
2015-04-21T14:31:22 <colinclark> maybe danaayotte has some ideas
2015-04-21T14:31:30 <colinclark> we could certainly change the name
2015-04-21T14:31:35 <colinclark> so it\'s not just "Accessibility"
2015-04-21T14:31:41 <danaayotte> ah
2015-04-21T14:31:43 <colinclark> and perhaps put some kind of qualification on it
2015-04-21T14:32:01 <colinclark> Instead of Accessibility, perhaps WCAG AA Compliance
2015-04-21T14:32:30 <danaayotte> is the longer-term plan to have a different (more qualitative?) kind of accessbility rating? or to stick with the compliance measure? colinclark?
2015-04-21T14:32:33 <colinclark> and a little comment, "based on automatable tests"
2015-04-21T14:32:43 <colinclark> no, i think we\'ll have to consider a bit of both, danaayotte
2015-04-21T14:32:57 <colinclark> It\'s certainly at least sort of viable to do basic accessibility evaluation automatically
2015-04-21T14:33:07 <colinclark> but ultimately I think user experiences may be more valuable
2015-04-21T14:33:17 <sepideh> colinclark, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, I\xe2\x80\x99ll change the name for now
2015-04-21T14:34:03 <colinclark> Can you try a version without it, as well?
2015-04-21T14:34:11 <sepideh> for sure
2015-04-21T14:34:13 <colinclark> it\'s the kind of thing that I might have to sponteneously decide on
2015-04-21T14:34:23 <sepideh> ok, I understand:)
2015-04-21T14:34:25 <colinclark> or do based on people\'s feedback when I give a rehearsal of the presentation
2015-04-21T14:35:04 <colinclark> But I think the biggest thing, from Kasper\'s suggestions, is to have the at-a-glance view be based on seeing the project holistically
2015-04-21T14:35:10 <colinclark> rather than build-by-build
2015-04-21T14:35:16 <colinclark> so tracking things over time helps, for example
2015-04-21T14:35:42 <colinclark> you want to know things like "how active is this project?"
2015-04-21T14:35:48 <colinclark> "how many contributors does it have?"
2015-04-21T14:35:58 <colinclark> how often, over time, do its tests break?
2015-04-21T14:36:01 <colinclark> that kind of thing
2015-04-21T14:36:01 <sepideh> I am trying bar chart now, which shows pass and failed over time as well as the duration of the test.
2015-04-21T14:36:10 <colinclark> neat
2015-04-21T14:36:19 <colinclark> sorry to put this on you so last minute, sepideh
2015-04-21T14:36:22 <colinclark> but i think it will be really useful
2015-04-21T14:36:33 <colinclark> you\'ll be around tomorrow as well?
2015-04-21T14:36:42 <colinclark> I figure there will be feedback and changes after I do the rehearsal
2015-04-21T14:37:13 <sepideh> yes
2015-04-21T14:37:20 <colinclark> cool

2015-04-21T15:41:26 <colinclark> hiya

2015-04-21T15:42:18 <danaayotte> colinclark
2015-04-21T15:42:48 <colinclark> do we have a cool name for people who can contribute services or assistance in our amazing multisided-platform-that-no-longer-should-be-called-a-multisided-platform?
2015-04-21T15:43:45 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-04-21T15:44:22 <danaayotte> I don\'t think we do colinclark, but I can brainstorm some ideas
2015-04-21T15:44:39 <colinclark> only if it just spontaneously occurs to you
2015-04-21T15:44:46 <colinclark> It came up during a presentation today
2015-04-21T15:44:55 <colinclark> where the name "Service Provider" was used
2015-04-21T15:45:01 <colinclark> and it seemed a bit too formal
2015-04-21T15:45:04 <danaayotte> rather
2015-04-21T15:45:10 <danaayotte> :)
2015-04-21T15:45:50 <colinclark> :)
2015-04-21T15:46:53 <danaayotte> I like contributor, but maybe a bit vague?
2015-04-21T15:47:01 <colinclark> yes
2015-04-21T15:49:09 <colinclark> The context that it came up in was someone saying, "Wait, but couldn\'t your nextdoor neighbour be someone how might provide assistance on demand?" "Yes!" "But your nextdoor neighbour doesn\'t sound like a \'service provider\'"
2015-04-21T15:49:45 <danaayotte> how about community contributor colinclark?
2015-04-21T15:50:05 <colinclark> What do they call people who rent their place on airbnb?
2015-04-21T15:50:15 <colinclark> "Hosts?"
2015-04-21T15:50:16 <danaayotte> hmmm
2015-04-21T15:50:18 <danaayotte> yeah
2015-04-21T15:50:20 <danaayotte> that\'s it
2015-04-21T15:50:35 <colinclark> There\'s something about having a nice name, but one that is specific enough to resonate
2015-04-21T15:50:41 <colinclark> anyway, it\'s not like we really need it
2015-04-21T15:50:50 <colinclark> i was just curious if we had already done some thinking in that regard
2015-04-21T15:56:21 <danaayotte> ok. I\'ll let you know if I think of anything else

2015-04-21T18:10:16 <colinclark> danaayotte: There\'s something odd about a touch-screen interface with no affordance
2015-04-21T18:10:38 <colinclark> I mean, even in this modern rage for flat designs, there\'s at least usually a tiny semblance of affordance
2015-04-21T18:10:57 <colinclark> When I was looking at your Crestron mockups, the on/off toggle is interesting in that respect
