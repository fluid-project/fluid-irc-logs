2015-05-07T13:18:07 <jhung> cindyli, Justin_o - what are your schedules like this morning? We should chat about those PGA wireframes once danaayotte is around. Maybe anastasiac will be around too.
2015-05-07T13:18:38 <Justin_o> jhung: anastasia is in the office now
2015-05-07T13:18:59 <jhung> ah I see her in the other channel.
2015-05-07T13:19:24 <cindyli> jhung: I'm good with anytime :)

2015-05-07T14:02:55 <sepideh> Good morning colinclark, Jess_ and danaayotte, this is an interesting visual representation of the Flicker ecosystem, with all its parts and actors and how they interact and move in the system. We may benefit from similar approaches for P4A after creation of personae and their user states and contexts http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/28
2015-05-07T14:23:42 <Jess_> sepideh: good find!
2015-05-07T14:24:06 <Jess_> the graphic is a bit hard to follow, but hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s inspiring!
2015-05-07T14:24:51 <danaayotte> thanks sepideh
2015-05-07T14:24:55 <sepideh> I agree, we can definitely do a better job ;)
2015-05-07T14:30:57 <michelled> danaayotte, sepideh: do you have some time to meet today to add design tasks to the iteration plan page?
2015-05-07T14:31:50 <sepideh> Hi michelled, for sure, but for which project?
2015-05-07T14:32:37 <michelled> all :)
2015-05-07T14:33:00 <michelled> our work always cross cuts between them all, so it makes sense to just plan it all together :)
2015-05-07T14:33:29 <sepideh> great! I\xe2\x80\x99m available all day

2015-05-07T20:06:09 <michelled> do you need to leave soon? we can talk next week if we need to
