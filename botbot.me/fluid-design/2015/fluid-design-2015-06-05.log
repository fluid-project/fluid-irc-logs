2015-06-05T14:29:06 <sepideh> Good afternoon Bosmon, Colin talked to me about a diagram you may need for a reasearch paper. However, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss the details before he goes on vacation. When you had a chance please let me know how I can help. thx :)

2015-06-05T18:04:03 <Bosmon> sepideh, michelled - would you have time to meet in a bit about my diagram? : P
2015-06-05T18:04:29 <sepideh> I\xe2\x80\x99m available
2015-06-05T18:10:55 <murilo_crivellar> anastasiac: when are you available for a quick chat?
2015-06-05T18:11:48 <Jess_> anastasiac: i\xe2\x80\x99m forwarding you emails that I think are good thread reminders \xe2\x80\x94 some are your emails, so they should sound familiar
2015-06-05T18:18:20 <anastasiac> Jess_: yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the emails, thanks. Now to figure what to say about them :-)
2015-06-05T18:20:28 <Jess_> anastasiac: i\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that having them and re-reading through them will at least have us clear on some of the past convos at least. not sure it needs to be in the deck or how it might be, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a start :)
2015-06-05T18:21:19 <anastasiac> yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking \xe2\x80\x93 depending on the issue \xe2\x80\x93 just saying \xe2\x80\x9cwe discussed this, and decided that\xe2\x80\x9d to remind people of decisions we made, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel compelled to raise the issue again
2015-06-05T18:23:35 <Jess_> exactly
2015-06-05T18:23:41 <Jess_> so we don\xe2\x80\x99t get bogged down anastasiac
2015-06-05T18:23:52 <Jess_> not as a sort of, we solved this, but as a kind of project memory

2015-06-05T19:26:17 <sepideh> Jess_ do you have any information regarding project RERC that you can forward to me?
2015-06-05T19:26:37 <Jess_> sepideh: just saw that\xe2\x80\xa6 gimme a few minutes to finish something up
2015-06-05T19:26:46 <sepideh> sure. thx
2015-06-05T19:50:23 <anastasiac> sepideh: regarding your PGA interactive demo: Could you please remind me of the link to access it? is it also available in a downloadable format that I could use offline?
2015-06-05T19:51:16 <sepideh> sure, give me  few minutes and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a link
2015-06-05T20:12:22 <sepideh> anastasiac: here is the link to the file. Dana has access to the project as well. So, she can get you a link http://invis.io/6K365AUP4
2015-06-05T20:12:43 <sepideh> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the mockup is downloadable, but let me try a few things
2015-06-05T20:14:10 <anastasiac> sepideh: don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m just being unreasonably paranoid about internet access at the workshop
2015-06-05T20:14:29 <sepideh> I have to upgrade to the professional level in order to download and there is monthly subscription for that. If you need it I can upgrade and pay just for a month
2015-06-05T20:16:01 <anastasiac> oh, nono, sepideh!
2015-06-05T20:16:07 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t need it
2015-06-05T20:20:32 <sepideh> ok :)
