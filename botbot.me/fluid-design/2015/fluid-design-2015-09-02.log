2015-09-02T16:05:52 <simonjb> danayo: could you add a link to the new simplified login designs to the "Designs" section of https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Security_Dashboard ?
2015-09-02T16:05:55 <simonjb> thanks
2015-09-02T16:06:35 <simonjb> ah, danayo you did already?
2015-09-02T16:09:26 * cindyli has quit
2015-09-02T16:10:28 <danayo> no I can do that simonjb, I put a link in the meeting notes from yesterday
2015-09-02T16:10:59 <danayo> oh wait, it\'s there - was it there all along? :)
2015-09-02T16:11:13 <simonjb> looks like there\'s a link already -- did you replace an existing file on the fluid wiki?
2015-09-02T16:11:42 <danayo> no, it wasn\'t on the fluid wiki, but I\'ve added it now
2015-09-02T16:12:18 <danayo> ok, wait, I guess it must have been there somewhere already!
2015-09-02T16:12:26 <danayo> I\'ll take another look
2015-09-02T16:12:31 <danayo> simonjb
2015-09-02T16:16:21 <danayo> simonjb, I must have attached it some time ago to the fluid wiki, but perhaps didn\'t add a link from any fluid wiki page, just from GPII wiki

2015-09-02T16:21:20 <simonjb> cindyli, Justin_o: danayo has uploaded some simplified login and signup designs https://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/PMT-login-simplified.pdf
2015-09-02T16:21:52 <cindyli> cool. thanks

2015-09-02T16:29:17 <simonjb> danayo: I just spoke with kasper about the relationship between a user\'s base preferences and context-specific preferences -- they are independent with no inheritance relationship
2015-09-02T16:32:17 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2015-09-02T16:33:33 <danayo> simonjb: when you say independent - do you mean that when a context-specific set is created, it begins as an empty set, rather than with the base set prefs?
2015-09-02T16:41:10 * jhung joined the channel
2015-09-02T16:41:27 <danayo> simonjb, I ask that because I\'m wondering - in the scenario where a user applies their GPII prefs to a website, then modifies them using UIO, then wants to save - in that moment if they agree to create a new (context-dep) set, I think the expectation would be that it would also contain all of their other preferences, rather than just the ones they\'ve modified using UIO
2015-09-02T16:41:44 <danayo> but maybe that\'s not true
2015-09-02T16:41:52 <simonjb> sorry danayo, I\'m in a meeting, will respond soon
2015-09-02T16:41:57 <danayo> ok, np
2015-09-02T17:08:44 <simonjb> sorry danayo, meeting is over; when preferences are stored or retrieved, the preferences for a particular context are stored or retrieved independently of other contexts (the base preferences are themselves stored in a context called "gpii-default") here\'s an example of what a preference set looks like with multiple contexts https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/prefere
2015-09-02T17:08:44 <simonjb> nces/li.json
2015-09-02T17:09:20 <simonjb> if we want to do merging or copying, we would have to do it ourselves -- there is no existing support in GPII
2015-09-02T17:15:08 <danayo> ok, thanks simonjb
2015-09-02T17:27:20 <danayo> simonjb:  in the case where a user\'s pref set is retrieved and applied to a website (and user authorizes only those prefs that apply), then user adjusts some things and saves back to the same set - we will be able to retain all their other preferences in that set, yes? the act of retrieving the applicable prefs won\'t "disappear" all the rest of their prefs? or will we have to perform a merge in this case too?
2015-09-02T17:31:10 <simonjb> danayo: at this point, I don\'t know everything that the preferences server offers in terms of programming interface, but we\'ll need to make sure that we have some way of only updating a particular context -- and we may need to do it
2015-09-02T17:32:51 <simonjb> danayo: I should also verify with kasper (I haven\'t yet) that using a context per websire actually makes sense and won\'t cause issues for other parts of the GPII

2015-09-02T17:33:30 <danayo> ok, thanks simonjb

2015-09-02T20:24:35 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just shared the draft I am working on with you. I will probabely change its structure tomorrow. and I have made a list of project examples that I will add tomorrow as well.
2015-09-02T20:24:52 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi, thanks
2015-09-02T20:26:25 <sepidehshahi> I just wanted to get your idea about this: many of the tools we are talking about are very well known in the field. So maybe instead of defining them, we should say, what are the risks of using those tools are if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an inclusive perspective. Or how an inclusive approach uses these common tools differently
2015-09-02T20:26:32 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2015-09-02T20:28:11 <danayo> by tools you are referring to design methods or approaches?
2015-09-02T20:33:24 <danayo> sepidehshahi ^
2015-09-02T20:33:30 <danayo> I think that sounds good
2015-09-02T20:33:49 <sepidehshahi> yes, like use cases, mind maps, persona, etc\xe2\x80\xa6

2015-09-02T20:48:06 <danayo> yes, in some cases that makes sense to me sepidehshahi - we didn\'t invent those tools, but we apply them with inclusivity in mind. however, something like co-design or participatory design is based in inclusivity - again we didn\'t invent it, but I think it\'s different than those others for this reason
2015-09-02T20:48:19 <danayo> if that makes sense :)
2015-09-02T20:48:22 <danayo> we can talk more tomorrow
2015-09-02T20:50:27 <sepidehshahi> that totally makes sense. Sure, we can talk more tomorrow. and if we had time, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the next step for surveys please. thanks danayo:)

2015-09-02T20:58:44 <danayo> Justin_o can you tell me what this message in my terminal means - when I tried to run git status: "Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo."
2015-09-02T21:00:02 <Justin_o> danayo: so i believe that\'s because you are using the git supplied by apple and i guess that\'s probably just something that\'s built into their dev tools.
2015-09-02T21:01:36 <danayo> ummmm, ok Justin_o, as opposed to what? I\'ve never had this problem before. what do you recommend I do?
2015-09-02T21:01:56 <Justin_o> danayo: is this a new machine, or have you updated the os or Xcode recently?
2015-09-02T21:03:14 <danayo> I\'ve used git on this machine before with no problem. might have updated Xcode? dont\' think I updated the OS (there is a pending update)
2015-09-02T21:04:08 * jhung joined the channel
2015-09-02T21:05:11 <danayo> hmmm Justin_o I just opened Xcode and it required me to agree to terms before finishing install! maybe that\'s it
2015-09-02T21:05:12 <danayo> ?
2015-09-02T21:05:22 <Justin_o> yah could be
2015-09-02T21:05:41 <danayo> let\'s see what happens. thanks
2015-09-02T21:05:44 <Justin_o> if you need to accept it from the command line now, you can try doing "sudo git status -s"
2015-09-02T21:07:14 <danayo> i ran git status again and it seems to be fine now
