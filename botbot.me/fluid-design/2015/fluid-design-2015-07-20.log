2015-07-20T16:03:32 <alanharnum> 12:01 alanharnum: sepideh: here's a few of GitHub repos of the charting libraries we're looking at:

2015-07-20T17:29:03 <murilocrivellari> hey sepideh, just a quick question: for the current CA tool designs, I'm working with web standard size format (600x800 px). With the new changes in layout, is it ok if I make it slightly more vertical/horizontal or should I keep the web size?

2015-07-20T18:13:26 <sepideh> alanharnum, do you know if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to have multiple licenses for a project? or there is always only one license per project.
2015-07-20T18:14:23 <alanharnum> yeah, definitely possible
2015-07-20T18:14:41 <alanharnum> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing talks about one example; also possible (though unusual) for a project to have different licenses for different components
2015-07-20T18:16:17 <sepideh> great, thanks

2015-07-20T20:45:47 <sepideh> avtar would you have 5 mins to review what I have got so far? thx
2015-07-20T20:48:40 <sepideh> avtar here is the link, I mostly worked on the Overview page today: https://www.dropbox.com/s/72jt26ew6ycesil/DSpace%20Dashboard-03.pdf?dl=0
2015-07-20T20:49:11 <sepideh> but I am not clear about the content that fills up the detail page.
