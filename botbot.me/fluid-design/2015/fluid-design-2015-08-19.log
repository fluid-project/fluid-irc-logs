2015-08-19T15:12:27 <murilocrivellari> hey sepidehshahi, I added the mobile mockups to the 2nd test creation. Could you please take a look at it? https://www.dropbox.com/s/6hh6b3oyxm81qay/OCS%20Mobile.pdf?dl=0
2015-08-19T15:12:45 <sepidehshahi> sure
2015-08-19T15:12:52 <murilocrivellari> thx
2015-08-19T15:15:20 <murilocrivellari> jessm: I've just finished listening to the radio lab talk about numbers. It's very very interesting! It got me thinking about what kind of symbolic/databased sounds (not sure if it's the right term) we could use to make sonified pieces more relatable to the users...
2015-08-19T15:15:32 <murilocrivellari> I'm still thinking btw haha
2015-08-19T15:16:19 <sepidehshahi> murilocrivellari: let\xe2\x80\x99s have a quick chat if you have time
2015-08-19T15:16:24 <murilocrivellari> sure

2015-08-19T16:10:28 <colinclark> murilocrivellari: I'm pretty interested in your idea of symbolic sounds :)
2015-08-19T16:10:54 <colinclark> I'd like to get back to our weekly sonification team meetings where we are able to speculate freely again
2015-08-19T16:11:02 <colinclark> while the pie chart work grows
2015-08-19T16:11:13 <colinclark> with simonjb and sepidehshahi
2015-08-19T16:11:19 <colinclark> and, of course, everyone else :)
