2015-08-25T13:35:55 <jessm> sepidehshahi: not that i know of. did you do a search on the website?
2015-08-25T13:36:22 <sepidehshahi> no, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Thanks

2015-08-25T13:36:49 <jessm> sepidehshahi: want to sync up on the survey with danayo when she\xe2\x80\x99s up?
2015-08-25T13:37:03 <sepidehshahi> for sure
2015-08-25T13:37:29 <sepidehshahi> I am just trying to find out what translation options Survey Monkey provides

2015-08-25T15:04:21 <danayo> hmmm sepidehshahi, good question. I think one per page is good, as long as we allow user to go back
2015-08-25T15:04:38 <sepidehshahi> sounds good, thanks danayo

2015-08-25T18:43:22 <sepidehshahi> murilocrivellari: could you please send me the link? thanks
2015-08-25T18:44:27 <murilocrivellari> sepidehshahi: here you are https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcxH6uB0STg&index=1&list=PLE046958DA3B4BA96
2015-08-25T18:44:41 <murilocrivellari> please tell me if you have toughest on that :)
2015-08-25T18:44:58 <murilocrivellari> thoughts
2015-08-25T18:48:56 <sepidehshahi> to be honest I had hard time listening to some of the sounds. I felt something like needles poking my brain. But overall, I could easily recognize different sounds.

2015-08-25T18:54:11 <murilocrivellari> sepidehshahi: I had the same feeling. But what I like about this track is that is really easy to recognize each sound
2015-08-25T18:55:00 <murilocrivellari> one thing that came to my mind (and we can obviously talk about it later on) is that sighted users usually have two distinct experiences with pie charts
2015-08-25T18:55:09 <sepidehshahi> danayo, colinclark and murilocrivellari this was the sketch that we tried to spread different  sounds along the piece: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/43778171/Sonification-PieChart-Sketch%235-Legend.mp3?version=1&modificationDate=1428592096533&api=v2
2015-08-25T18:56:30 <murilocrivellari> one being the "glimpse" experience you have at a first glance, which gives you a general idea of the chart and the proportions among slices, an the other being the experience you have when you further examine it
2015-08-25T18:57:17 <murilocrivellari> my question is: is there a way we can cover both experiences with our sonified piece?
2015-08-25T18:57:23 <murilocrivellari> sepidehshahi: ^
2015-08-25T18:58:43 <sepidehshahi> yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have been trying to address with the sketches we\xe2\x80\x99ve got so far. But none of them have fully addressed the experiences you mentioned.
2015-08-25T19:00:04 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is way, we have to keep exploring and trying different approaches and making very quick sketches to get closer to what we need
2015-08-25T19:00:24 <murilocrivellari> sepidehshahi: good, I guess I can start from that. Thanks :)
2015-08-25T19:00:42 <sepidehshahi> thank you:)
2015-08-25T19:35:56 <danayo> simonjb: just out of a meeting with colin and want to review the security-related design work that we have so far - can I ping you in an hour or so, or shall we plan to meet tomorrow morning? not sure if michelled is still around

2015-08-25T20:11:29 <colinclark> murilocrivellari: That\'s a really good articulation of the perceptual issues...
2015-08-25T20:12:07 <colinclark> i.e. the "at a glance" gestalt of a pie chart
2015-08-25T20:12:17 <colinclark> and the more temporal experience of scrutinizing it for specific information
2015-08-25T20:12:31 <colinclark> reading the labels, studying the legend, doing more close comparisons between segments
2015-08-25T20:12:40 <colinclark> it\'s possible we can do it all in one sonification
2015-08-25T20:12:59 <colinclark> it\'s also possible we might be able to "stack" and "unstack" the voices in a sonification
2015-08-25T20:13:08 <colinclark> stack them for the at-a-glance, comparative view
2015-08-25T20:13:46 <colinclark> and unstack them (perhaps with addtional labelling or reading out of quantities) to more closely scrutinize the data
2015-08-25T20:14:31 <colinclark> when I say "voices," I mean it in the musical sense
2015-08-25T20:15:27 <murilocrivellari> colinclark: lol, "voices" got me confused. Thanks for clarifying
2015-08-25T20:16:49 <murilocrivellari> I guess the stack/unstack approach is a very good way to explicit both experiences
2015-08-25T20:18:10 <colinclark> I have no idea if it will work
2015-08-25T20:18:20 <colinclark> but you can imagine that the same sounds could work either stacked or spread out
2015-08-25T20:18:21 <colinclark> linearly
2015-08-25T20:19:23 <murilocrivellari> yes, I\'d say it\'s worth trying :)
2015-08-25T20:19:59 <danayo> +1 colinclark, murilocrivellari
2015-08-25T20:21:05 <colinclark> I might try to whip up a little example with Flocking later this week
2015-08-25T20:21:15 <colinclark> if I can get this deliverable written first
