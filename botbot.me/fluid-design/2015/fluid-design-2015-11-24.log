2015-11-24T21:47:47 <jhung> danayo: I created this page from the brainstorming notes. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Brainstorming+2015 I was thinking of putting the OpenEd 2015 notes as a H2 section within that doc. What do you think?
2015-11-24T21:48:04 <jhung> Also, the title needs work. Open to suggestions.
2015-11-24T21:48:42 * gtirloni has quit
2015-11-24T21:49:18 <danayo> jhung I wonder if the openEd notes would be better included on the wiki page you created at the conference - the one with all the links?
2015-11-24T21:50:13 <danayo> i think they might get a bit lost on the brainstorming page - that seems like a separate (but related) topic to me
2015-11-24T21:50:38 <danayo> thanks for creating the wiki page!
2015-11-24T21:53:21 <jhung> danayo: I've sent out that resource page to people who attended OpenEd. So I don't think the debrief notes should go into the same doc. Would a child page make sense?

2015-11-24T18:05:23 <colinclark> jhung: I was thinking about your observation about the ILDH after talking to people about it at Open Ed
2015-11-24T18:05:26 <colinclark> it\'s pretty interesting
2015-11-24T18:05:40 <colinclark> the question of how to balance "orientation" with simplicity and not overwhelming them
2015-11-24T18:05:50 <colinclark> I took a peek at the Wayback Machine for the ILDH
2015-11-24T18:06:00 <colinclark> and it was interesting to compare the front pages, old and new
2015-11-24T18:06:03 <colinclark> https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162748/http://handbook.floeproject.org/index.php/Home
2015-11-24T18:06:12 <colinclark> http://handbook.floeproject.org/
2015-11-24T18:06:19 <colinclark> The latter has a lot more "structure" to it
2015-11-24T18:06:39 <colinclark> yet perhaps one of the things we lost along the way was the visibility of the topics that the ILDH covers
2015-11-24T18:07:03 <colinclark> "Why is This Important?" and "What is the Approach?" are pretty abstract topics
2015-11-24T18:07:23 <colinclark> prompting the question "What is THIS?" and "What approach?"
2015-11-24T18:07:34 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-11-24T18:07:44 <colinclark> Whereas the old version listed a lot of things, up front, that users might be interested in, or might click on to see what we\'re about
2015-11-24T18:08:16 <colinclark> "Testing," "Metadata," "Authoring content" etc.
2015-11-24T18:09:34 <jhung> exactly colinclark. Also I find that there are lots of interesting tidbits nested in broader topics (i.e. there\'s a nice bit about using abbreviations and math but it\'s tucked within a page under EPUB). I think we can improve the way we present and structure our content.
2015-11-24T18:13:33 <colinclark> Yup, I agree
2015-11-24T18:13:41 <colinclark> I think the key is that users don\'t usually read when they first encounter a site
2015-11-24T18:13:57 <colinclark> http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/
2015-11-24T18:14:10 <colinclark> So it\'s probably an information architecture issue
2015-11-24T18:14:17 <colinclark> they\'re going to skim the navigation bars
2015-11-24T18:14:29 <colinclark> the side first, likely, and then the top
2015-11-24T18:14:54 <colinclark> so our landing page needs to give them the cues to a) orient themselves and b) explore the content themselves
2015-11-24T18:16:01 * anastasiac has quit
2015-11-24T18:19:22 <jhung> colinclark: yes. I think we\'re overdue for a little restructuring\xe2\x80\xa6 the fact the navigation doesn\'t really help users get to what they want is a pretty good sign we can make some improvements. I\'ll make a jira and put it on the iteration page so it can be addressed in the future.

2015-11-24T18:21:13 <colinclark> awesome, jhung, sounds like a plan
2015-11-24T18:25:14 <danayo> colinclark, jhung I was also thoughtful about how the ILDH structure and content (and feedback we\'re getting) can inform/relate to the design guidelines/cards that we\'ll be making for P4A
2015-11-24T18:25:27 <colinclark> those are going to be awesome
2015-11-24T18:25:30 <danayo> :)
2015-11-24T18:25:33 <colinclark> when are we going to start those, danayo?
2015-11-24T18:26:03 <danayo> I think NOW would be good :)
2015-11-24T18:26:11 <danayo> I planned to get started very soon
2015-11-24T18:26:17 <jhung> danayo: I\'m not familiar with that - can you give me a quick summary of that work with P4A?
2015-11-24T18:26:20 <danayo> I need to check in with others
2015-11-24T18:26:25 <danayo> sure jhung
2015-11-24T18:26:41 <colinclark> danayo: I\'m cool to do some brainstorming sometime this week if you\'d like
2015-11-24T18:26:46 <colinclark> with whoever else is interested
2015-11-24T18:26:48 <danayo> that would be great colinclark
2015-11-24T18:27:04 <danayo> and jhung, actually, we had a long chat in the channel one day a couple of weeks ago, let me find the date
2015-11-24T18:27:04 * Jess_ has quit
2015-11-24T18:27:35 <jhung> thanks danayo
2015-11-24T18:27:39 <danayo> I\'ll also pull the text from the P4A DoW
2015-11-24T18:30:07 <danayo> \xe2\x80\xa2 Identify good practice guidelines for internal project use as they pertain to business practices, infrastructure design and user experience design for required transactions.
2015-11-24T18:30:08 <danayo> \xe2\x80\xa2 Outline initial good practice guidelines for external use.
2015-11-24T18:30:09 <danayo> with the audience being all P4A stakeholders
2015-11-24T18:30:11 <danayo> jhung ^
2015-11-24T18:30:16 <danayo> that\'s from the P4A DoW
2015-11-24T18:30:29 <danayo> and you\'ll find our discussion on Nov 10
2015-11-24T18:30:55 <danayo> we need to create some kind of "method cards" for inclusive design
2015-11-24T18:31:20 <danayo> that isn\'t just about reproducing typical "method cards"
2015-11-24T18:31:38 <danayo> we want to convey through form and content ideas of user as designer, configurability etc
2015-11-24T18:33:46 <colinclark> I imagine we\'d somehow capture the kinds of design considerations we put into creating UI Options
2015-11-24T18:34:11 <colinclark> and simonjb\'s "different sensitivities" philosophy in our sonification work
2015-11-24T18:34:20 <colinclark> and the "self" part of self-assessment
2015-11-24T18:34:50 <danayo> yes x 3 colinclark!
2015-11-24T18:35:15 <danayo> thinking through our considerations for UIO would be great place to start
2015-11-24T18:35:45 <danayo> based on something concrete - a real example!
2015-11-24T18:35:53 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2015-11-24T18:35:58 <colinclark> and it\'s interesting...
2015-11-24T18:36:11 <colinclark> I was talking to alanharnum yesterday about how we make research exemplars for several reasons
2015-11-24T18:36:24 <colinclark> sometimes we want to build them into tools and frameworks that are ubiquitous
2015-11-24T18:36:31 <colinclark> sometimes we just want people to be inspired by them
2015-11-24T18:36:40 <colinclark> Inspired not abstractly, but specifically
2015-11-24T18:36:54 <colinclark> in terms of "Here, do this in your own application/site/context/project/whatever"
2015-11-24T18:37:20 <colinclark> so I can imagine the cards would be very useful in articulating what those things are that we want people to "steal"
2015-11-24T18:37:26 <colinclark> from our own designs
2015-11-24T18:37:42 <colinclark> I use the word "steal" in the nice, welcoming way :)
2015-11-24T18:37:50 <danayo> yes :)
2015-11-24T18:37:54 <colinclark> Borrow, remix, reuse, extend, quote
2015-11-24T18:37:55 <colinclark> etc. :)
2015-11-24T18:38:16 <danayo> so you mean in some cases the stealing is actually implementing a component, and other times it may just inspire a UI design or something?
2015-11-24T18:38:25 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-24T18:38:27 <colinclark> mostly the latter
2015-11-24T18:38:36 <danayo> right
2015-11-24T18:38:38 <danayo> that makes sense
2015-11-24T18:38:43 <colinclark> again, I use the term "steal" jokingly
2015-11-24T18:38:51 <danayo> absolutely
2015-11-24T18:38:53 <colinclark> but the point is that you can talk about inclusion all day
2015-11-24T18:38:55 <colinclark> customization etc.
2015-11-24T18:38:58 <colinclark> and it\'s just abstract for people
2015-11-24T18:39:10 <colinclark> by building a demo or an exemplar, it becomes tangible
2015-11-24T18:39:26 <colinclark> they can literally see and interact with a particular dimension of inclusive design
2015-11-24T18:39:38 <colinclark> and learn from an artifact, rather than just an abstract principle or whatever
2015-11-24T18:41:04 <danayo> for sure - as evidenced by folks\' excitement at seeing our tools in action! expecially UIO and explore tool which are so immediate
2015-11-24T18:41:10 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-24T18:41:15 <colinclark> I forgot to mention to you, danayo
2015-11-24T18:41:23 <colinclark> that at IBM, the First Discovery Tool played a similar role
2015-11-24T18:41:45 <colinclark> there was a point where it was clear that, after 1.5 days presenting the GPII in-depth, people still didn\'t quite have their finger on what the GPII was
2015-11-24T18:41:55 <colinclark> what kind of "data" we were actually talking about
2015-11-24T18:42:08 <colinclark> and simonjb, quite brilliantly, realized that demonstrating the FD tool might help
2015-11-24T18:42:12 <colinclark> and everything just clicked in a remarkable way
2015-11-24T18:42:16 <danayo> very cool!!!
2015-11-24T18:42:25 <colinclark> and all these abstractions about "autopersonalization" and the like became real
2015-11-24T18:42:26 <danayo> simonjb relayed some very positive feedback
2015-11-24T18:42:31 <danayo> that\'s so great
2015-11-24T18:42:32 <colinclark> oh good, cool
2015-11-24T18:42:56 <colinclark> it was also satisfying to hear people acknowledge how much design work it was to make a tool like this
2015-11-24T18:43:01 <colinclark> to make it really simple
2015-11-24T18:43:02 <danayo> :D
2015-11-24T18:43:28 <danayo> that is very satisfying indeed!
2015-11-24T18:45:52 <danayo> sounds like the workshop at IBM went really well colinclark, thanks to you and simonjb and gtirloni!
2015-11-24T18:46:07 <colinclark> I think it was pretty cool overall
2015-11-24T18:46:23 <colinclark> I didn\'t do much, it was everyone else who did the hard work
2015-11-24T18:46:46 <colinclark> simonjb and gtirloni and Bosmon endured hours of questions :)
2015-11-24T18:46:59 <danayo> and Bosmon!
2015-11-24T18:47:02 <danayo> thank you
2015-11-24T18:47:10 <danayo> nice work
2015-11-24T18:48:57 <gtirloni> the FD tool really gave everybody a lot of insights, it was great.. from that moment one you could see the questions were making more sense :)
2015-11-24T18:49:15 <michelled> :)
2015-11-24T18:49:22 <gtirloni> colinclark: oh yeah, you didn\'t do much.. except keep us from getting lost all the time :)
