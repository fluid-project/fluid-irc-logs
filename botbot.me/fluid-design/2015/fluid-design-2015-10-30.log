2015-10-30T13:36:56 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: for those learning git http://xkcd.com/1597/
2015-10-30T13:38:35 <sepidehshahi> haha, funny and true Justin_o :)
2015-10-30T13:39:20 <alanharnum> Justin_o: that\'s actually not too bad a description of how I work with Git ^^;
2015-10-30T13:40:03 <alanharnum> i will dig into the internals if I need to do so to recover something or work out a complicated merge, but if something goes wrong i will usually just "git reset --hard" or similar to get things back to a working state
2015-10-30T13:41:00 <alanharnum> it\'s the beauty of version control imo :P

2015-10-30T14:21:54 <sepidehshahi> Hi Jess_: the Behavior Change Strategy cards were quite interesting specially towards the end. and lots of good examples were included. Thanks for sharing
2015-10-30T14:22:30 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: what did you find interesting?
2015-10-30T14:27:06 <sepidehshahi> I had interacted with many of the things they were talking about in my daily activities. However, I had not realized those things are planned and trying to change my behavior! I think there is a great application for these strategies for comercial products and services\xe2\x80\xa6 and I am thoughful about how we could apply some of those startegies in our field Jess_
2015-10-30T14:28:48 <sepidehshahi> it also showed how with very small changes and modifiication we can impact people\xe2\x80\x99s decision making process
2015-10-30T14:29:04 <Jess_> cool :)
2015-10-30T14:29:11 <Jess_> glad you got so much out of it
2015-10-30T14:30:08 <Jess_> for others: https://www.artefactgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Behavior-Change-Strategy-Cards-with-Dividers-Feb-2014.pdf
2015-10-30T14:31:38 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: and it\xe2\x80\x99s true\xe2\x80\xa6 choosy mom\xe2\x80\x99s choose Jiff
2015-10-30T14:31:44 <Jess_> JIF
2015-10-30T14:39:06 <Jess_> sepidehshahi: i foudn the last two points particularly interesting
2015-10-30T14:39:19 <Jess_> sometimes there is such a thing as too many options
2015-10-30T14:39:30 <Jess_> but i can imagine it would be quite bad to misinterpret that
2015-10-30T14:39:44 <Jess_> rather, it might just make us more mindful of how we present options so there is less fatigue
2015-10-30T14:42:35 <sepidehshahi> exactly! there is a very fine line there\xe2\x80\xa6 another intersting point was about breaking down the big gains to smaller gains to encourage users, but grouping the small losses to a big loss to not disapoint users. That\xe2\x80\x99s also may be useful for the gamification aspects of our work
