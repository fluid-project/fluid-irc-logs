2015-11-09T17:25:07 <colinclark> danayo: Do you know what pitches you used for the "Density-to-value-mapping zoom to units" sketch?
2015-11-09T17:25:21 <colinclark> the tens sound is higher and the ones sound is lower
2015-11-09T17:29:01 <colinclark> sounds to me like a G and an F, playing along with my guitar anyway :)
2015-11-09T17:39:12 <alanharnum> sepidehshahi: do you have a moment to look at this background circle effect?
2015-11-09T17:39:26 <sepidehshahi> sure

2015-11-09T19:50:39 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi, what are your plans for the interview transcripts? are you going to summarize them somehow? also, do you need help with transcribing?
2015-11-09T19:52:59 <sepidehshahi> danayo: we should somehow put them on the wiki. So, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if we want to put the entire transcription there or a summarized version of it. But my main goal was to extract a list of interesting points, anecdotes, or highlights from them that could be useful for our report.
2015-11-09T19:53:31 <danayo> that sounds good, perhaps a table would be best - as you did with the surveys - one column per question?
2015-11-09T20:45:11 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel
2015-11-09T20:50:46 <sepidehshahi> danayo: yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start that table when I\xe2\x80\x99m done with the next two interviews on Wednesday. and we can add highlights and commnets in there.
2015-11-09T21:00:23 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you have a few min for a qucik talk about p4a?
2015-11-09T21:01:45 <danayo> sure sepidehshahi

2015-11-09T22:40:42 <danayo> pie chart tool looking good alanharnum!
2015-11-09T22:41:09 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah i just pushed up using sepideh\'s green palette + some text effects for the slice text
2015-11-09T22:41:17 <alanharnum> i think it looks nice :)
2015-11-09T22:41:41 <alanharnum> sepideh are going to fine-tune it tomorrow
2015-11-09T22:41:44 <danayo> cool
2015-11-09T22:41:47 <alanharnum> ^sepideh & I
2015-11-09T22:42:05 <danayo> I think the text effect works well
2015-11-09T22:42:17 <danayo> the contrast between those first two colours may be a bit low?
2015-11-09T22:43:33 <danayo> not sure alanharnum ^
2015-11-09T22:43:44 <danayo> i wonder if borders around the sections would help, but may not look as nice
2015-11-09T22:43:57 <alanharnum> we could draw borders easily enough
2015-11-09T22:44:00 <danayo> i know that eventually we want to be able to apply our contrast themes
2015-11-09T22:44:02 <danayo> cool
2015-11-09T22:44:17 <alanharnum> i also think we could probably safely increase the size of the pie, which might help
2015-11-09T22:52:46 <alanharnum> danayo: I increased the pie size and added a thin white stroke between the pie slices
2015-11-09T22:53:04 <alanharnum> (experimentally)
2015-11-09T22:53:21 <alanharnum> https://rawgit.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/FLOE-432/demos/index.html
2015-11-09T22:53:32 <danayo> nice, i think the white border helps a lot alanharnum. i like it bigger too
