2015-09-16T19:06:18 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just checked out the wiki page about the inclusive design process. I\xe2\x80\x99m so intrigued by that and wondering if we should incorporate such thoughts in the CSUN paper?
2015-09-16T19:06:52 <sepidehshahi> and also if you have some time today or tomorrow, would you like to talk about that paper as well, since its submission is next Friday? and it is not even close to be ready\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-09-16T19:07:11 <danayo> sepidehshahi: oh! next friday  :O
2015-09-16T19:07:15 <danayo> sure
2015-09-16T19:07:22 <sepidehshahi> :D
2015-09-16T19:07:26 <danayo> and yes, those ideas are definitely relevant
2015-09-16T19:08:36 <danayo> could we discuss tomorrow sepidehshahi?
2015-09-16T19:08:46 <sepidehshahi> for sure

2015-09-16T20:31:19 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I really really like your sonification sketches! great work
2015-09-16T20:31:54 <sepidehshahi> the sounds can be easily distinguished
2015-09-16T20:32:21 * cindyli has quit
2015-09-16T20:33:47 <danayo> great sepidehshahi, thanks - I think I may have labelled some of those links wrong, just checking
2015-09-16T20:33:55 <sepidehshahi> I like the sonfication_percussive_R_justify the most and I think if you add the legend of the other piece (sonification_percussive_legend_first) to it, it will become a very clear piece
2015-09-16T20:35:36 <danayo> cool, I'll try that sepidehshahi
2015-09-16T20:35:44 <danayo> I've been thinking about how some of these could be combined
2015-09-16T20:35:50 <danayo> optionally
2015-09-16T20:36:00 <danayo> to provide different ways of listening to the same chart/data
2015-09-16T20:36:21 <danayo> I think all the links are correct now
2015-09-16T20:38:07 <sepidehshahi> tha\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea. with the sound pieces that you have selected most combinations should work.
