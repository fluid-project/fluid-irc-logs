2015-10-01T15:31:33 <danayo> anastasiac: was looking at the prefs framework tutorial pins/callouts and your discussion yesterday - the in-line pins seem like they'd be easy to miss - I wonder if we made them the same size as the pins you have in the boxes, and have them in-line with the text (i.e. not superscripted)? if we keep them pointing toward the word and possibly also do something on hover (highlight the callout box in some way) I think this will make it v
2015-10-01T15:31:33 <danayo> clear what they are referring to. In mobile perhaps we could have them open up over the text on touch? (in this case they'd def need to be bigger)

2015-10-01T15:49:56 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I just took a look at the chart authoring wireframe - it looks great! The audio component I guess we'll iterate on in the future?
2015-10-01T15:51:11 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s right, because we are not sure what type of sonification we will end up with. So do you think we should talk about this in today\xe2\x80\x99s design crit?
2015-10-01T15:52:10 <sepidehshahi> danayo:and jhung do you have designs/ideas to share in today\xe2\x80\x99s design crit?
2015-10-01T15:53:16 <jhung> I don
2015-10-01T15:53:42 <jhung> t think there's anything for Chart Authoring to talk about until we have something to show sepidehshahi
2015-10-01T15:54:40 <jhung> I don't have anything for today's crit sepidehshahi.
2015-10-01T15:55:05 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2015-10-01T15:58:25 <danayo> sepidehshahi, jhung: doesn't the latest version of chart auth tool have a number of new features that folks haven't seen and that might be worth discussing? or maybe you discussed it last week?
2015-10-01T15:59:11 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo: Maybe it does? I don't recall what the last version people saw was...
2015-10-01T15:59:46 <sepidehshahi> Everyone was busy last week so we cancelled the crit. Yes, we could discuss the new designs and get feedback. We also can talk about the accessility features of the QI dashboard. These are the only things I have for the crit.
2015-10-01T15:59:56 <danayo> also i'm going to try to get UIO security integration mockups into a state that I can show something
