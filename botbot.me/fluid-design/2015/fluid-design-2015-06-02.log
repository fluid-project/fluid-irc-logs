b'2015-06-02T17:54:40 <cindyli> jhung: to make the back button work, we need to add another panel for the voting and it should be part of the tool. the upper bar has different buttons like "settings" etc
2015-06-02T17:55:26 <cindyli> the upper bar is totally different from what\'s in FD
2015-06-02T17:55:29 <Justin_o> danayo: i think i\'ve managed to get it working better, the tooltips were drifting quite far from the controls, but i think i\'ve got the positioning more consistent now
2015-06-02T17:56:49 <anastasiac> cindyli: what, in particular, should I be noticing in your FLOE-365 branch?
2015-06-02T17:57:23 <danayo> ok great Justin_o
2015-06-02T17:58:08 <cindyli> anastasiac: demos/js/demos.js and one more loader grade - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-365/demos/voting/schemas/schemas.js#L26
2015-06-02T17:58:32 <anastasiac> ah, gotcha cindyli, thanks
2015-06-02T17:58:57 <danayo> cindyli jhung: not clear on what you mean about adding another panel
2015-06-02T17:59:33 <danayo> do you mean create a voting panel of our own instead of using the screenshot?
2015-06-02T18:00:34 <cindyli> that\'s what we are thinking, danayo, but there\'s some technical issues. this voting panel will be part of the tool but it has a different top bar
2015-06-02T18:00:57 <cindyli> our top bar has mute and help buttons and the voting page has "settings" and others
2015-06-02T18:01:34 <cindyli> having a different top bar for just one of the panels in the tool will be tricky, danayo, jhung

2015-06-02T18:04:51 <danayo> ok cindyli anastasiac jhung I\'m thinking that what we actually want to show is the FD tool integrated into an existing voting tool. So we don\'t actually want to make the voting page look like the FD tool, right?
2015-06-02T18:05:16 <cindyli> yes
2015-06-02T18:05:41 <danayo> that is, I\'d rather just have the next button lead to static html of the as-is voting screen, rather than make the voting screen match the FD tool, if those are our 2 options
2015-06-02T18:06:03 <anastasiac> maozillah: welcome to the channel!
2015-06-02T18:06:06 <danayo> I think it\'s more important to show the above, then to make the voting screen functional

2015-06-02T18:06:39 <maozillah> @anastasiac thanks!

2015-06-02T18:07:13 <danayo> welcome maozillah :)
2015-06-02T18:08:06 <maozillah> :D
2015-06-02T18:08:16 <anastasiac> danayo, yes, it would probably better if we could go the other way: make the FD tool look like the voting screen
2015-06-02T18:08:47 <anastasiac> and yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s have the next button of the FD tool lead to a static html of the as-is voting screen
2015-06-02T18:09:19 <cindyli> danayo, anastasiac, we do want the selected prefs applied to the static html, right?
2015-06-02T18:09:29 <anastasiac> yes, ideally
2015-06-02T18:09:45 <cindyli> ok, needs some extra work for that
2015-06-02T18:09:52 <danayo> yes cindyli
2015-06-02T18:09:58 <cindyli> ok
2015-06-02T18:11:48 <danayo> jhung, cindyli do you need mockups for that ^ ?
2015-06-02T18:14:24 <cindyli> danayo: i think i understand what you mean. jhung, would you be able to coordinate with danayo on how the static html should look like and create it?
2015-06-02T18:14:49 <jhung> danayo: I can just make a version of screen #3 in static html. Shouldn\'t be a problem.
2015-06-02T18:15:06 <jhung> cindyli: you can make a placeholder for now.
2015-06-02T18:15:46 <cindyli> ya, will do that for now, jhung, i also need to add javascript into that static html to have selected prefs applied
2015-06-02T18:16:50 <jhung> ok. add that to your place holder. I will then add the anywhereballot html into that file as part of my FLOE-367 branch
2015-06-02T18:16:54 <anastasiac> cindyli, would you have a minute to talk to me about your mod to make the next button visible on the last panel?
2015-06-02T18:16:56 <jhung> cindyli ^
2015-06-02T18:17:48 <cindyli> jhung: ok
2015-06-02T18:17:51 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac
2015-06-02T18:22:31 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli. And you\xe2\x80\x99re actually doing work so that the \xe2\x80\x9cnext\xe2\x80\x9d button on the last panel will go to the static voting page, right? I should be able to re-use that to go to the assessment page, when you push it
2015-06-02T18:22:59 <danayo> ok jhung, thanks
2015-06-02T18:23:00 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac
2015-06-02T18:29:43 <jhung> cindyli: the step count is removed in the voting demo. Do you want to fix this in your branch? Otherwise I can just use CSS to hide it in my FLOE-367 branch
2015-06-02T18:30:13 <jhung> I mean the wireframe shows the step count removed. But your branch has step count present.

2015-06-02T18:45:45 <jhung> cindyli: my styling is done for now. Should you merge this into FLOE-365?

2015-06-02T19:00:38 <jhung> There\'s a bug where if you hover over the speech button, the text doesn\'t show. I\'m fixing that now cindyli
2015-06-02T19:00:51 <cindyli> cool, jhung
2015-06-02T19:06:37 <jhung> pushed my changes to my branch cindyli.
2015-06-02T19:07:41 * danayo joined the channel
2015-06-02T19:24:28 <anastasiac> cindyli, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a problem with the changes you made to support showing the \xe2\x80\x98next\xe2\x80\x99 button on the last panel
2015-06-02T19:24:39 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s in the \xe2\x80\x9cindexToDisposition\xe2\x80\x9d stuff
2015-06-02T19:24:52 <anastasiac> I now get the \xe2\x80\x9cfinish\xe2\x80\x9d string on the second-last panel and the last panel
2015-06-02T19:25:27 <cindyli> good finding, anastasiac, i will try it out later on
2015-06-02T19:25:28 <anastasiac> oh, probably wrong channel for this discussion

2015-06-02T20:25:06 <murilo_crivellar> hi danayo, I\'ve just finished doing the adjustments we discussed. I merged all the additional preferences in this file https://www.dropbox.com/s/xypaw3nn2z117on/FD%20additional%20preferences%20for%20June%20workshop.ai?dl=0
2015-06-02T20:27:38 <danayo> great murilo_crivellar, thanks
2015-06-02T20:27:54 <danayo> looking through it now
2015-06-02T20:37:06 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: it looks fabulous! go ahead and send to fluid list
2015-06-02T20:37:58 <murilo_crivellar> thanks, danayo :) I\'m going to send it right now
2015-06-02T20:40:49 <danayo> thanks murilo_crivellar - one thing to note is that the icons are not updated to the latest, but that is fine for now
2015-06-02T20:41:16 <danayo> we still need to pull together the single flow of all preferences (or maybe you\'ve started on this?). for that we\'ll need to select our "favourites" from the various alternatives that you\'ve presented, and mix them in with the other wireframes. We\'ll also need to decide on the order of preferences.

2015-06-02T20:43:08 <danayo> I can make a start on this murilo_crivellar if you haven\'t already
2015-06-02T20:43:10 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: I did a Safari template that I intend to use to pull the preferences together. I\'ll keep in mind to update the icons to the latest for that
2015-06-02T20:43:17 <danayo> ah ok
2015-06-02T20:43:18 <danayo> great
2015-06-02T20:43:32 <murilo_crivellar> I\'ll send you a link. Just a sec
2015-06-02T20:44:32 <danayo> great. and the latest new icons are here https://www.dropbox.com/s/aw5gpib10z6bi6m/04-icons-final-draft.ai?dl=0
2015-06-02T20:45:15 <murilo_crivellar> thanks, danayo. Here\'s the link for the template https://www.dropbox.com/s/9bq6wwfnquiwevv/Safari%20Mockup.ai?dl=0
2015-06-02T20:46:31 <sepideh> danayo: I sent you an email with the links. thx for your help
2015-06-02T20:46:43 <danayo> great, thanks sepideh!
2015-06-02T20:46:53 <sepideh> thank you
2015-06-02T20:46:59 * sepideh has quit
2015-06-02T20:50:00 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: safari template looks good. we may decide we want to show the tablet version instead/as well (i.e. full screen without keyboard prefs). michelled, do you have an idea of how you want this to look? (re: the slide show of tool with all prefs)? murilo has started on a version that shows the tool in a desktop environment (Safari browser window)
2015-06-02T21:00:48 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: I think she\'s afk. Can we discuss about it tomorrow? I\'m leaving now...
2015-06-02T21:01:05 <danayo> yes. have a good night

2015-06-02T14:07:11 <Justin_o> danayo, sepideh: we have a new student starting today. We were going to ask her to do some testing of the first discovery tool, did you want to do user testing with her on it before hand?
2015-06-02T14:07:46 <sepideh> has she already started using the tool?
2015-06-02T14:09:10 <Justin_o> sepideh: i don\'t think so
2015-06-02T14:09:29 <Justin_o> or at least not much.. depends on what anastasiac showed her when she was getting setup
2015-06-02T14:10:25 <anastasiac> she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t reall tried it yet, sepideh and danayo
2015-06-02T14:10:56 <sepideh> danayo: what if we use the same questions that we had developed for user testing?
2015-06-02T14:11:18 <sepideh> or maybe we can just get a general sense of what she thinks and what she expects to see/do
2015-06-02T14:14:08 * cindyli has quit
2015-06-02T14:14:28 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-06-02T14:16:29 <danayo> Justin_o, Sepideh, I think we could get some good feedback in a more general way if we describe the context to her first, perhaps describe some of the use cases, and then have her walk through it with those in mind. It would be good to sit with her while she does it and ask her to think out loud/take notes
2015-06-02T14:17:06 <danayo> how does that sound?
2015-06-02T14:19:18 <sepideh> That sounds good. I can sit with her and go through the tool and get her feedback and communicate that with the team
2015-06-02T14:19:39 <Justin_o> sepideh, danayo: sounds good.. when do you think you might have time to do that?
2015-06-02T14:21:08 <sepideh> danayo: and anastasiac are there any specific issues or tasks that you want to get her feedback?
2015-06-02T14:21:27 <anastasiac> not that I can think of myself, right now, sepideh
2015-06-02T14:22:25 <danayo> I\'d be interested to hear her feedback just based on using the tool generally, sepideh
2015-06-02T14:23:23 <sepideh> sure
2015-06-02T14:28:13 <danayo> thanks sepideh
2015-06-02T14:48:03 <cindyli> danayo: on the last panel for the voting demo, the label for the next button should be "next" rather than "finish", right?
2015-06-02T14:48:20 <cindyli> i mean on the last panel
2015-06-02T14:49:12 <danayo> yes cindyli, so you mean the text size panel right?
2015-06-02T14:49:28 <cindyli> yes, danayo
2015-06-02T14:49:49 <danayo> yes cindyli, that\'s right https://www.dropbox.com/s/d7tow5u5y3ykx7p/FD%20tool%20voting.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-02T14:49:56 <cindyli> ok
2015-06-02T14:49:59 <cindyli> thanks, danayo
2015-06-02T14:51:43 <danayo> by the way cindyli I modified the icons in the voting tool and got some quick feedback from anastasiac yesterday but we should discuss - I\'m hoping it won\'t add too much work
2015-06-02T14:51:55 <danayo> jhung also ^
2015-06-02T14:52:13 <cindyli> sure, danayo and jhung
2015-06-02T14:52:49 <jhung> sure danayo. When do you want to chat?
2015-06-02T14:54:06 <danayo> jhung have you had a chance to look at the wireframes? mostly I just wanted to know if we can implement the "1 2 3 Vote!" instead of the usual icons
2015-06-02T14:54:30 <danayo> the tool looked a little odd with just the 3 icons in there
2015-06-02T14:55:03 <danayo> and it\'s such a short process that I thought this approach worked better
2015-06-02T14:56:01 <danayo> what do you think jhung?
2015-06-02T15:00:12 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-06-02T15:02:17 <jhung> let me take a look danayo
2015-06-02T15:05:57 <sepideh> danayo: thanks for the great comments regarding the flow.
2015-06-02T15:06:11 <danayo> you are welcome sepideh :)
2015-06-02T15:06:36 <sepideh> I have updated the last branch and now I am going to import the new icons to the wires and export them as individual PDFs to have them ready for the mockup
2015-06-02T15:08:52 <sepideh> Good morning Jess_, have you had a chance to look at the ecosystem document? if there are no major issues, we can send it out to the list along with Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s doc
2015-06-02T15:10:00 <Jess_> sepideh: on first glance my conclusions were that it\xe2\x80\x99s awesome :)
2015-06-02T15:10:41 <Jess_> i\xe2\x80\x99m going to read through it more closely before tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting but first I\xe2\x80\x99m going to 1) bungle up the meeting time in an email and 2) get through some priorities I have to tackle today. so, ship it to the list and let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it more tomorrow!
2015-06-02T15:11:31 <sepideh> :) great plan! I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it out and we can discuss the details and related issues tomorrow.thx
2015-06-02T15:11:41 <Jess_> sepideh: it\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting
2015-06-02T15:11:59 <sepideh> yes!!!
2015-06-02T15:12:07 <Jess_> i really like the two docs together
2015-06-02T15:15:06 <jhung> danayo: I can see what you mean about the empty space, but I think it\'s fine for what we want to show.
2015-06-02T15:15:06 <danayo> sepideh Jess_ I agree the ecosystem doc looks fantastic!
2015-06-02T15:15:39 <danayo> which 2 docs are you referring to Jess_?
2015-06-02T15:15:53 <sepideh> thanks danayo, it\xe2\x80\x99s still the first draft, hopefully we will get some constructive feedback tomorrow and can improve it
2015-06-02T15:16:13 <Jess_> danayo: there\xe2\x80\x99s a kevin doc with some narrative to accompany it
2015-06-02T15:16:19 <sepideh> Kevin has also made a business model document for different elements of the ecosystem
2015-06-02T15:16:20 <Jess_> they\xe2\x80\x99re sending out to list i think
2015-06-02T15:16:28 <danayo> great, thanks
2015-06-02T15:17:11 <danayo> jhung, anastasiac and I also discussed that it would be good to demonstrate flexibility with the icons as well
2015-06-02T15:17:35 <danayo> it wasn\'t just the empty space that was bugging me... I think it was more to do with the progress indication, and there being so few steps
2015-06-02T15:17:39 <danayo> jhung ^
2015-06-02T15:18:54 <danayo> but again, if it introduces more work than we have time for we can leave it. perhaps we should have a quick chat after standup about it
2015-06-02T15:19:48 <jhung> Regarding the icons - is this a high priority? Can this be something that is done if there\'s time?
2015-06-02T15:20:54 <jhung> Regarding the small number of steps, not sure what else we can do? I suppose we can add a few more of our own adjusters?
2015-06-02T15:21:13 <jhung> danayo^
2015-06-02T15:24:57 <danayo> jhung, I would say it\'s not a high priority. I think anastasiac felt it wouldn\'t be much extra work? I don\'t want to add adjusters for this version of the tool, so if need be we can just leave it as-is
2015-06-02T15:25:59 <anastasiac> right, not high priority. I was thinking that the icons are just a \xe2\x80\x9ccontent\xe2\x80\x9d attrib in the CSS specifying a character, so that could just be changed to a different character, but if it\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, perhaps not worth too much efforts
2015-06-02T15:26:00 <jhung> danayo: There\'s overhead in creating the icons unless there already are icons to use.
2015-06-02T15:26:36 <anastasiac> oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m confused, I thought we were taking about digits
2015-06-02T15:27:34 <jhung> anastasiac, danayo: so we want those numbers to be icons - icon font - and not actual numerical characters?
2015-06-02T15:27:52 <anastasiac> jhung, could we not just use numerical characters?
2015-06-02T15:28:13 <jhung> that\'s what I\'m wondering. Which is why I\'m confused about use of icons anastasiac.
2015-06-02T15:28:44 <jhung> Unless we\'re talking about the turn voice off / arrows etc.

2015-06-02T15:29:51 <danayo> jhung, now I\'m confused! are we talking about the same thing? the " 1 2 3 Vote" at the bottom of the tool here? https://www.dropbox.com/s/d7tow5u5y3ykx7p/FD%20tool%20voting.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-02T15:30:25 <jhung> Earlier you said " anastasiac and I also discussed that it would be good to demonstrate flexibility with the icons as well"
2015-06-02T15:30:43 <jhung> What do you mean exactly by that danayo? It\'s not clear to me what the intention is.
2015-06-02T15:31:22 <danayo> ah sorry jhung - replacing the icons with the numbers
2015-06-02T15:31:48 <jhung> Oooooooh. danayo. Yo comprendo danayo.
2015-06-02T15:31:58 <danayo> oh good!! sorry for confusion!
2015-06-02T15:32:25 <jhung> haha no worries. Glad we got it sorted.

2015-06-02T16:03:01 <danayo> jhung focus never lands on "Vote" - selecting next on last screen takes user directly into voting screens
2015-06-02T16:10:35 <jhung> Cool. That helps danayo
2015-06-02T16:13:01 <danayo> great

2015-06-02T17:09:23 <cindyli> jhung: my pull request for the voting demo includes the 4 panels of language, welcome, contrast and text size. The last panel is the text size panel with "next" button on it. clicking the next button won\'t take u to the vote. is that ok?
2015-06-02T17:10:27 * danayo joined the channel
2015-06-02T17:12:00 <jhung> cindyli: is it possible to have the last "next" click take you to another screen? We would then display a screen capture of the anywhereballot voting UI.
2015-06-02T17:13:32 <cindyli> jhung: it\'s certainly possible, give me url, or the filename, you want the next to go to
2015-06-02T17:13:38 <danayo> +1 jhung cindyli
2015-06-02T17:14:06 <danayo> jhung do you want me to grab a screenshot?
2015-06-02T17:14:31 <jhung> danayo: that would be great. Can you attach it to FLOE-365?
2015-06-02T17:14:34 <danayo> sure
2015-06-02T17:14:47 <jhung> thanks!
2015-06-02T17:20:56 <danayo> jhung cindyli would it be possible for the next button to go straight to the anywhere ballot url?
2015-06-02T17:21:20 * Jess_ has quit
2015-06-02T17:21:23 <danayo> it would have to land part-way through the anywhere ballot flow
2015-06-02T17:21:37 <danayo> like here http://anywhereballot.com/race/straight-party-vote/
2015-06-02T17:23:27 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-06-02T17:26:12 <cindyli> danayo: not a problem
2015-06-02T17:30:31 <danayo> anastasiac, jhung, do you think it would be best to link the next button from the last voting FD panel directly to the anywhere ballot url?
2015-06-02T17:31:14 <anastasiac> danayo, do you mean the actual anywhereballot url? or our mock-up of it?
2015-06-02T17:31:41 <cindyli> danayo: the selected prefs would not be applied to the voting url, is that ok,
2015-06-02T17:32:03 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should like to the actual anywhereballot site
2015-06-02T17:32:07 <jhung> danayo: I was wondering if it woulid be confusing if the prefs don\'t apply. We\'d have to make it clear it doesn\'t actually work.
2015-06-02T17:32:09 <anastasiac> we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to demonstrate an alternative
2015-06-02T17:32:22 <anastasiac> that site already has its own equivalent of a prefs editor
2015-06-02T17:32:22 <danayo> right
2015-06-02T17:32:29 <danayo> of course
2015-06-02T17:33:16 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-06-02T17:37:03 <danayo> ok anastasiac jhung cindyli I\'ve got screen captures of the first few voting panels - there are 2 intro panels and then the first voting panel. 1. how to vote 2. info about the ballot and 3. first voting panel.
2015-06-02T17:37:05 <danayo> can/should we mock up all three and make the next/back buttons functional? or should we just launch right into panel 3 (or panel 1?) and leave it at that?
2015-06-02T17:37:20 <danayo> they are here http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-365
2015-06-02T17:38:58 <anastasiac> danayo, michelled and I had the same questions about jumping back and forth between FD screens and non-FD screens. I think there are some technical questions about how that could/would be accomplished that cindyli and Justin_o will  likely have to provide input on
2015-06-02T17:39:01 <jhung> danayo: Good question. I prefer going directly to #3 since it says what we want to say explicitly.
2015-06-02T17:42:09 <cindyli> danayo: making all three working with all the buttons, noticed the 2nd screen only has one "begin voting" button, would be quite a bit work. it\'s probably possible if i spend all my time on it till tomorrow afternoon
2015-06-02T17:42:57 * maozillah has quit
2015-06-02T17:44:14 <cindyli> that means to hold off or place in a rough fix (without tests) on fixing the nav icon scrolling issue, FLOE-359
2015-06-02T17:46:24 <danayo> cindyli jhung anastasiac perhaps we should keep it simple and just have it go from FD tool to screen #3
2015-06-02T17:46:24 * maozillah joined the channel
2015-06-02T17:47:53 <cindyli> danayo: should the back button work on the #3 screen to go back to FD tool?
2015-06-02T17:49:14 <danayo> cindyli: if we can make that work, great. also the "Settings" button could return to the first screen of the FD tool. but again, these are not totally necessary functions
2015-06-02T17:51:44 <danayo> Justin_o what was the tooltip issue that you mentioned at standup?
2015-06-02T17:51:54 <cindyli> danayo, jhung: to make any of these things work on the #3 screen? we cannot simply use the screenshot, we need markup and functions for them.
2015-06-02T17:52:56 <jhung> cindyli: yes. We\'d have to add another panel or maybe another HTML file.
2015-06-02T17:53:05 * michelled joined the channel
2015-06-02T17:53:09 <jhung> Not hard to do, but adds another task danayo, cindyli
2015-06-02T17:53:52 <anastasiac> cindyli: you mentioned that michelled and I should look at your voting demo branch - that\xe2\x80\x99s FLOE-365, right?
2015-06-02T17:54:03 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac
2015-06-02T17:54:08 <anastasiac> k
2015-06-02T17:54:27 <jhung> it lacks styling anastasiac. I\'m working on that in my FLOE-367 branch
2015-06-02T17:54:39 <anastasiac> thanks for the heads-up, jhung
