2015-05-26T14:56:05 <murilo_crivellar> hi michelled danaayotte. Here\'s a link for the icon studies I\'ve been working on: https://www.dropbox.com/s/br1sxu9n8rsoplp/SL%20Icon.pdf?dl=0
2015-05-26T14:56:47 <murilo_crivellar> Take a look when you have the chance :)
2015-05-26T14:58:05 <jessm> sepideh: i think you might have fallen into outlook directory auto-complete...
2015-05-26T14:58:15 <jessm> who did you mean to email your P4A email to?
2015-05-26T15:01:07 <michelled> murilo_crivellar: thanks - this is interesting. I think we\'d go far if we had someone who knows ASL to weigh in. colinclark can you think of someone we could ask?
2015-05-26T15:03:23 <sepideh> jessm, I wanted to sen it to Prosperity 4 all list, Victor and Katerina. who did I sent it to??
2015-05-26T15:03:40 <jessm> you sent it to a different Katerina \xe2\x80\x94 someone at OCAD
2015-05-26T15:03:49 <jessm> sepideh:  you wanted to send it to touliouk@certh.gr
2015-05-26T15:04:17 <jessm> but at OCAD they use Outlook that tries to be helpful \xe2\x80\x94 and so it chose a Katerina here and auto-completed it for you
2015-05-26T15:04:43 <sepideh> oh no\xe2\x80\xa6ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send another email just to Katerina
2015-05-26T15:04:54 <sepideh> thanks jessm for catching that :)
2015-05-26T15:05:12 <jessm> sepideh: np, it happens to me more often than I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of
2015-05-26T15:09:29 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-05-26T15:11:50 <danaayotte> thanks for those icons murilo_crivellar
2015-05-26T15:12:59 <danaayotte> the one I\'ve seen used most often is the first (the ASL to indicate a link to instructions), but I agree with michelled, would be good to get more feedback
2015-05-26T15:22:20 <danaayotte> oh, also murilo_crivellar I just noticed the last page of your wireframes - I really like the replacement of yes/no text with sign language
2015-05-26T15:24:56 <murilo_crivellar> danaayotte: Thanks. I think the yes/no buttons might work like that. At the FLOE meeting yesterday, we chatted about having gifs for the tooltips and the rest of the text

2015-05-26T15:39:40 <danaayotte> oh i like that idea murilo_crivellar
2015-05-26T15:48:32 <michelled> danaayotte: maybe you can split up the remaining settings that we were planning to create first draft designs for and give some to murilo_crivellar?
2015-05-26T15:48:56 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-26T15:49:09 <danaayotte> yes, I was thinking same michelled, I\'ll touch base with murilo_crivellar soon
2015-05-26T15:49:17 <michelled> great, thx!
2015-05-26T15:50:10 <murilo_crivellar> I\'ll be here, danaayotte :)
2015-05-26T15:50:18 <danaayotte> great
2015-05-26T15:54:04 <michelled> murilo_crivellar: for context, the list is on this page: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan in the chart called "First Discovery Designs to be presented at workshop, but not implemented
2015-05-26T15:54:04 <michelled> "
