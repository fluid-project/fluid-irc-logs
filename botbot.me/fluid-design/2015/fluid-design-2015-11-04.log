2015-11-04T15:35:56 <danayo> colinclark, sepidehshahi, alanharnum, anyone and everyone: sonification meeting now?
2015-11-04T15:36:07 <colinclark> let\'s do it!
2015-11-04T15:36:19 <sepidehshahi> sure
2015-11-04T15:36:29 <colinclark> I think simonjb is stuck at home without an internet connection this morning
2015-11-04T15:36:36 <colinclark> so we\'ll have to go ahead without him
2015-11-04T15:36:39 <danayo> ok

2015-11-04T16:53:11 <jhung> danayo, jessm - using that SickerYou site that alanharnum mentioned yesterday, the quote for stickers is $49.90 for 200. So we\'re looking at about $100 for both sticker runs. This is much less than printing shops which I was getting quotes of $100-$200 per run.
2015-11-04T16:57:01 * jhung joined the channel
2015-11-04T17:03:59 <danayo> that sounds good jhung
2015-11-04T17:09:01 <alanharnum> jhung: I was really happy with the quality of what I got from Stickeryou
2015-11-04T17:09:45 <alanharnum> i realize i have the custom sticker from that run on my phone
2015-11-04T17:10:58 <alanharnum> stickeryou also often has discount codes in the 10-15% range available for first-time orderd
2015-11-04T17:12:35 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-11-04T17:18:39 <jhung> nice i\'ll look that up alanharnum

2015-11-04T19:15:01 <sepidehshahi> hi gtirloni, I was wondering if you could help me record the community meeting today.
2015-11-04T19:15:33 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-11-04T19:19:22 <gtirloni> sepidehshahi: hi, sure. since you\'re an operator on vidyo, you just need to connect to standup using vidyodesktop, click on the participants icon, then on the bottom left you\'ll see a tiny icon that has a label "control meeting". if you click that, it\'ll open a new website which has a red record button
2015-11-04T19:20:40 <gtirloni> sepidehshahi: if there\'s any trouble, i can start the recording from here too, no worries.
2015-11-04T19:21:20 * michelled joined the channel
2015-11-04T19:21:25 <sepidehshahi> Seems easy gtirloni, thanks for the instructions. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if there were any problems
2015-11-04T19:22:11 <jessm> jhung: i think i can say we\xe2\x80\x99re a \xe2\x80\x9cgo\xe2\x80\x9d on the sticker price you quoted above
2015-11-04T19:22:32 <jhung> jessm: okay. I\'ll get that started.
2015-11-04T19:22:43 <jessm> jhung: thanks!
2015-11-04T19:24:37 * clown joined the channel
2015-11-04T19:25:01 <jessm> jhung: please let me know if it begins to go over ~$100
2015-11-04T19:25:14 <jhung> ok jessm

2015-11-04T19:47:22 <gtirloni> sepidehshahi: creepy guest recorder joined meeting \\o/
2015-11-04T19:52:43 <sepidehshahi> I\xe2\x80\x99m recording it gtirloni
2015-11-04T19:52:49 <sepidehshahi> should I stop?
2015-11-04T19:52:52 <gtirloni> no no
2015-11-04T19:53:20 <gtirloni> when recording is on, a participant called "(guest) recorder" joins the meeting
2015-11-04T19:53:31 <gtirloni> it is a way of letting everyone know the recording is happening
2015-11-04T19:53:33 <gtirloni> it\'s all good :)
2015-11-04T19:53:47 <sepidehshahi> ohh ok:)
2015-11-04T19:54:40 <lliskovoi> yay, thanks for recording sepidehshahi!

2015-11-04T21:20:06 <sepidehshahi> gtirloni: can I just end the recording? where is it going to be saved?
2015-11-04T21:20:28 <gtirloni> yes
2015-11-04T21:20:53 <gtirloni> you can grab it here: https://prd-vid05p-tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/replay
2015-11-04T21:21:40 <sepidehshahi> it shows there are 0 videos gtirloni
2015-11-04T21:21:54 <gtirloni> do you see "Admin Manager" at the top right corner?
2015-11-04T21:22:37 <sepidehshahi> yes
2015-11-04T21:22:49 <gtirloni> that\'s where you, as an operator, can see other people\'s videos
2015-11-04T21:22:57 <gtirloni> since the room is owned by Jess, it\'s probably in Jess\' area
2015-11-04T21:23:06 <jessm> sepidehshahi: are you asking how to end it?
2015-11-04T21:23:19 <sepidehshahi> great, I see it, thx
2015-11-04T21:23:50 * cindyli has quit
2015-11-04T21:24:04 <colinclark> danayo: I was just thinking about the story Charles told
2015-11-04T21:24:18 <danayo> which one colinclark?
2015-11-04T21:24:23 <colinclark> about how he found his HyperCard app embedded inside someone else\'s
2015-11-04T21:24:25 <colinclark> much to his surprise
2015-11-04T21:24:27 <danayo> ah
2015-11-04T21:24:34 <colinclark> but what if there was a kind of natural linkage that happened
2015-11-04T21:24:40 <colinclark> So, just a basic scenario
2015-11-04T21:24:48 <colinclark> Teacher makes a resource with some text, video, and audio
2015-11-04T21:25:01 <colinclark> and then the students are tasked with making their own alternate versions
2015-11-04T21:25:10 <colinclark> they could click a button and "open up" the resource to be editable
2015-11-04T21:25:21 <colinclark> put in the videos they found during their research
2015-11-04T21:25:33 <colinclark> augment it with their own notes
2015-11-04T21:25:47 <colinclark> but still have it be connected to the original resource
2015-11-04T21:25:59 <danayo> very cool colinclark
2015-11-04T21:26:00 <colinclark> so at any time the teacher could see the variations of the resource
2015-11-04T21:26:17 <colinclark> and how it went from student to student, evolving over the course of the project, say
2015-11-04T21:26:34 <colinclark> This kind of environment needn\'t be very sophisticated or complex
2015-11-04T21:26:55 <danayo> LET\'S BUILD IT
2015-11-04T21:26:59 <colinclark> yes, let\'s :)
2015-11-04T21:27:55 <colinclark> I guess even in the context of the sonification tool, this is conceivable
2015-11-04T21:28:12 <colinclark> providing listeners with the ability to refine a chart for their own personal needs
2015-11-04T21:28:15 <colinclark> and then share it with others
2015-11-04T21:28:19 <danayo> totally
2015-11-04T21:28:32 <danayo> on a FLOPPY DISK
2015-11-04T21:28:34 <danayo> :)
2015-11-04T21:31:17 <colinclark> hahaha
