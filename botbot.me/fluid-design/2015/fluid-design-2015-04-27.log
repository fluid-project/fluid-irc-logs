2015-04-27T14:42:04 <sepideh> Good morning colinclark, based on the DSpace description in GPII wiki and also waht I have found in Github, jenkins, Travis CI, etc. I have sketched out this flow for DSpace. https://www.dropbox.com/s/m04mbkykjtmvh96/DSpace%20page%20View.pdf?dl=0
2015-04-27T14:42:33 <sepideh> it may be too simplistic, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good start for our conversation and discovering what we are missing
2015-04-27T14:44:43 <colinclark> hey sepideh
2015-04-27T14:45:08 <colinclark> this looks cool
2015-04-27T14:45:19 <colinclark> I'd love to chat more about today when I'm in the office if you have some time
2015-04-27T14:45:42 <sepideh> that would be great
