2015-05-28T20:52:12 <jhung> danayo: do you remember which Welcome icon we decided to use?
2015-05-28T20:52:54 * Jess_ has quit
2015-05-28T20:53:27 <danayo> jhung it was 4 with modifications
2015-05-28T20:53:29 <danayo> I think
2015-05-28T20:53:56 <danayo> 3 or 4
2015-05-28T20:55:57 <jhung> The modifications was to make it a little more horizontal, correct?
2015-05-28T20:56:02 <jhung> ^ danayo
2015-05-28T20:56:21 <danayo> yes, well, more squarely proportioned
2015-05-28T20:56:31 <danayo> anastasiac here\'s what I\'ve got https://www.dropbox.com/s/zhm6o95xx32jjt8/FD%20tool%20edu%20assessment%20with%20test%20screens.pdf?dl=0
2015-05-28T20:56:41 <danayo> last 3 screens
2015-05-28T20:57:15 <danayo> last screen shows very rough beginning of what a "PCP"-like panel might look like but I don\'t really want to go there
2015-05-28T20:57:57 <danayo> in this case I styled the test to look like the tool, since there is really no "branding" to match
2015-05-28T20:58:03 * clown has left the channel
2015-05-28T20:59:10 <danayo> could have name entry up front and tool could be personalised ("Hi Bradley" etc)
2015-05-28T20:59:12 <danayo> I really don\'t know
2015-05-28T21:17:43 <anastasiac> danayo: sorry for the delay. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about the pcp-like panel, i.e. not sure about something hiddent that requires action to activate. This is intended for \xe2\x80\x9cfirst discovery\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0recall all the
2015-05-28T21:17:50 <anastasiac> \xe2\x80\x98getting in the door\xe2\x80\x99 discussions
2015-05-28T21:18:08 <anastasiac> this is meant to help people who have trouble using the interface without this
2015-05-28T21:18:31 <anastasiac> but on the other hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s an different idea
2015-05-28T21:18:43 <anastasiac> one that would probably stimulate some good thought
2015-05-28T21:21:39 <danayo> like I said I don\'t really want to go there. but we\'ll eventually need some way for user to go back and adjust prefs without having to go through the whole process again
2015-05-28T21:21:46 <danayo> more interested in what you think about the testing context
2015-05-28T21:25:15 <anastasiac> danayo: I think the testing content is fine!

2015-05-28T14:30:55 <sepideh> michelled & jessm, do you know any institution (both for senior and students) that I could use their branding (logo and color pallette) for reskinning the FD tool?
2015-05-28T14:47:25 <michelled> good question - jessm, do you think we could use OER Commons? since UIO is in there already and we did a bunch of design for them
2015-05-28T14:49:58 <anastasiac> michelled, jessm, what do you think about re-using the \xe2\x80\x9cRichmond Open Learning\xe2\x80\x9d logo we created for the Electrons demo? http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/
2015-05-28T14:50:21 <anastasiac> we could change it to \xe2\x80\x9cRichmond Seniors Tech Centre\xe2\x80\x9d or something :-)
2015-05-28T14:50:52 <anastasiac> the layout of that page is taken from an existing oer site
2015-05-28T14:51:57 <michelled> that sounds like a good idea anastasiac
2015-05-28T14:52:28 <sepideh> I agree, I\xe2\x80\x99ll use to do a quick mock up and see how it looks. thanks anastasiac
2015-05-28T15:10:41 <jessm> sepideh: michelled: anastasiac: i like the idea of reusing
2015-05-28T15:11:04 <jessm> and a quick search online would probably find us some nice senior centers
2015-05-28T15:11:09 <jessm> what about the one in that film...
2015-05-28T15:11:11 <jessm> hold on...
2015-05-28T15:11:41 <jessm> danaayotte: and jvass; and i wnet to see it ages ago
2015-05-28T15:11:50 <jessm> danaayotte: do you remember the name?
2015-05-28T15:11:55 <danaayotte> oh
2015-05-28T15:11:59 <danaayotte> cyberseniors
2015-05-28T15:12:05 <jessm> there it is
2015-05-28T15:12:16 <jessm> it\xe2\x80\x99s based in Toronto and associated with a senior centre

2015-05-28T15:14:47 <sepideh> this video is fantastic!!
2015-05-28T15:14:56 <danaayotte> it was a really great movie
2015-05-28T15:17:07 <sepideh> danaayotte: with diffrent colors, the tool doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look as good\xe2\x80\xa6 and we have to define a criteria for reskinning, e.g. they background color can\xe2\x80\x99t be a light color, etc.
2015-05-28T15:23:42 <danaayotte> right sepideh
2015-05-28T15:24:31 <sepideh> check this out please https://www.dropbox.com/s/oet8m3wcb9gco99/FD%20Tool-Rebranding-Sepi.pdf?dl=0
2015-05-28T15:27:15 <anastasiac> that\xe2\x80\x99s looking great, sepideh
2015-05-28T15:27:32 <sepideh> it\xe2\x80\x99s toooo green!
2015-05-28T15:29:21 <danaayotte> :)
2015-05-28T15:30:26 <danaayotte> I think it\'s fine. perhaps we could make the green a little darker?
2015-05-28T15:31:02 <danaayotte> I think the neutral colored buttons work well
2015-05-28T15:31:22 <danaayotte> we could even make those a little darker to match the tree trunk
2015-05-28T15:52:51 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-28T15:53:40 <sepideh> great suggestions danaayotte, i\xe2\x80\x99ll update the file

2015-05-28T16:21:46 <sepideh> danaayotte: jim is talking about FD tool in deep context. Such is including FD functions within Skype and then the changes they make in that application will be saved as their preferences. Is thi the extend we want to take the tool to for seniror? Or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s better to stick to a few primary questions nd then adjusting the set of preferences based on the seniors\xe2\x80\x99 response.
2015-05-28T16:23:08 <sepideh> just to simplify my question, do you think we should target Case31 or Case #2 on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s wiki page?
2015-05-28T16:23:20 <sepideh> case#3
2015-05-28T16:24:31 <danaayotte> sepideh, i think we should focus on case #1
2015-05-28T16:24:49 <danaayotte> anastasiac, jessm do you agree? ^

2015-05-28T16:25:43 <danaayotte> jhung I pulled out what I thought were the relevant screens for voting from the full selection

2015-05-28T16:26:41 <danaayotte> you\'ll see an artboard there labelled VOTING
2015-05-28T16:26:51 <jhung> danaayotte: ok great thanks!
2015-05-28T16:26:55 * clown joined the channel
2015-05-28T16:27:02 <jhung> I probably won\'t get around to that until tomorrow the earliest.
2015-05-28T16:27:07 <anastasiac> danaayotte, jessm, sepideh, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking case #1, the more general intake processs
2015-05-28T16:27:57 <danaayotte> ok jhung
2015-05-28T16:30:21 <danaayotte> Justin_o can you please remind me -  the reset functionality that we discussed really just for demo purposes, right? (not for the user to be able to reset the tool?)
2015-05-28T16:31:22 <Justin_o> danaayotte: yes, it\'s really just for the demo, not something that would be in production
2015-05-28T16:31:44 <danaayotte> right, thanks Justin_o
2015-05-28T16:33:14 <danaayotte> in that case I think putting a "demo reset" button on the congratulations page is probably best
2015-05-28T16:34:05 <sepideh> I agree anastasiac! I\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on case#1
2015-05-28T16:34:11 <danaayotte> perhaps it could just be white text on black or something so it doesn\'t look like an FD tool button
2015-05-28T16:35:15 <danaayotte> sounds great sepideh
2015-05-28T16:55:30 <jessm> yes, dana and sepideh: #1

2015-05-28T18:03:29 <colinclark> I figure the agenda for these kinds of things is open; a kind of potluck
2015-05-28T18:03:39 <colinclark> bring what you\'ve got, be it design mockups, ideas, or software
2015-05-28T18:03:53 <jessm> colinclark: i think ppl. are having lunch

2015-05-28T18:03:58 <danaayotte> sure. we could use the time to look at what we\'ve got for PGA workshop so far and discuss if we\'re on the right track
2015-05-28T18:04:10 <jessm> where is this happening?
2015-05-28T18:04:24 <michelled> sounds like a great idea

2015-05-28T20:12:59 <sepideh> great, thx
2015-05-28T20:15:56 <danayo> anastasiac, i\'m at a bit of a loss re: edu assessment as I can\'t find anything online in the way of standardized tests. I could use an image from Khan Academy of a sample SAT - in that case the audience probably doesn\'t require any particular language changes in the tool, so it would be the same tool, perhaps with a login up front? but a login to Khan Academy? it seems a bit odd to me
2015-05-28T20:16:38 <danayo> i also found an example of a test page for a young audience that I could use - but it\'s not framed in any "standardized testing" kind of way
2015-05-28T20:16:58 <danayo> I suppose I could create a dashboard or frame for it
2015-05-28T20:17:15 <danayo> but I\'m a bit hesitant as I don\'t know what these standardized tests typically look like
2015-05-28T20:17:17 <anastasiac> danayo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it needs to be \xe2\x80\x9cstandardized\xe2\x80\x9d per se. What\xe2\x80\x99s the example?
