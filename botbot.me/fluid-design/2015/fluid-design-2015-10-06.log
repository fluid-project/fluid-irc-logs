2015-10-06T14:37:24 <sepidehshahi> Hi jessm, would be able to meet with me and danayo at 1:00 today?
2015-10-06T14:41:20 * michelled joined the channel
2015-10-06T14:43:27 <jessm> sepidehshahi: can\xe2\x80\x99t do 1 \xe2\x80\x94 can we do 2:30?
2015-10-06T14:44:38 <sepidehshahi> danayo does 2:30 work for you?
2015-10-06T14:45:52 * jhung joined the channel
2015-10-06T14:46:04 <danayo> simonjb, michelled, will we meet at 2 today?
2015-10-06T14:48:41 <danayo> sepidehshahi: are you happy with the survey responses so far? looking through them, it seems to me that the questions we\'re asking are effective - for the most part folks seem to understand what we\'re asking and are giving clear, detailed responses. it\'s good!
2015-10-06T14:53:46 <sepidehshahi> Danayo, I was telling Kevin yesterday that I was expecting a little bit more of details. But he reminded me that after all it\xe2\x80\x99s  a survey and not an interview\xe2\x80\xa6 So, I think yes, overall I am happy with the results so far:) except for the magic wand question.. I was really hoping to get more creative and out of the box reponses, but it seems that participants not tend to stay very realistic and practical, or make a joke about
2015-10-06T14:53:46 <sepidehshahi> it\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-10-06T14:54:45 <sepidehshahi> sorry I meant tend to stay realistic and practical
2015-10-06T14:55:38 <danayo> yeah, the magic wand question is an interesting one - I think because of the nature of the question we\'ll tend to get all sorts of different responses, but I think that\'s ok
2015-10-06T14:58:33 <sepidehshahi> we can start highlighting the interesting ideas in that document and document all our comments
2015-10-06T14:59:40 <danayo> sounds good sepidehshahi
2015-10-06T15:01:01 <danayo> sepidehshahi, jessm, if i\'m meeting with simonjb and michelled at 2, i think we better set our meeting at 3. i\'ll try to confirm with them asap
2015-10-06T15:01:26 <sepidehshahi> 3 works for me
2015-10-06T15:01:41 <jessm> works for me too
2015-10-06T15:02:08 <danayo> ok let\'s make it 3 then
2015-10-06T15:05:13 <simonjb> danayo, michelled: meeting at 2 would work for me, I think it could be a quick meeting but it might be worthwhile to check in
2015-10-06T15:05:40 <danayo> ok, thanks simonjb

2015-10-06T16:02:46 <danayo> colinclark, sepidehshahi, jhung, simonjb, alanharnum, fluid-everyone, i think we were sometimes meeting on wednesdays at 1:00 for sonification? does that work for everyone this week?
2015-10-06T16:03:35 <Justin_o> danayo: wednesdays are the new soccer days :(
2015-10-06T16:03:43 <alanharnum> danayo: this worked previously for me, but now conflicts with... what Justin_o said :(
2015-10-06T16:03:48 <danayo> ah ok
2015-10-06T16:04:13 <sepidehshahi> same here:(
2015-10-06T16:05:50 <colinclark> Being a soccer wimp, I\'m free :)
2015-10-06T16:13:32 <danayo> how about 10:30 tomorrow?
2015-10-06T16:14:58 <danayo> colinclark, Justin_o, sepidehshahi, alanharn_ everyone? ^
2015-10-06T16:15:33 <sepidehshahi> It works for me danayo
2015-10-06T16:16:18 <Justin_o> danayo: not sure you\'ll need me at the meeting or not, but i\'ll be free if you do
2015-10-06T16:18:41 <colinclark> danayo: It works for me, if it\'s not too early for you :)
2015-10-06T16:18:55 <colinclark> Justin_o: everyone\'s welcome to come sonification it up
2015-10-06T16:19:03 <colinclark> sonify it up?
2015-10-06T16:19:11 <danayo> sonifup
2015-10-06T16:19:27 <danayo> 10:30 then
2015-10-06T16:20:13 <Justin_o> :) you\'d hear my excitement if the emoji were sonified

2015-10-06T17:20:47 <danayo> fluid-everyone: I was just playing with the browsealoud widget / accessibility toolbar on this site and found it really interesting: http://www.texthelp.com/en-us (you should find it at the bottom left of the screen)
2015-10-06T17:22:00 <danayo> I like how the point-and-speak works, although the toolbar jumps to the top for some reason - I was thinking about our early designs for UIO point-and-speak and Joanna\'s widget, which I think works better
2015-10-06T17:22:25 <danayo> also interesting how they show some things on the iniitial toolbar, but you can choose settings icon to see all of your preferences
2015-10-06T17:23:11 <danayo> made me think also of the FD tool and how we were thinking about a verification / confirmation step at the end
2015-10-06T17:26:01 <danayo> and of course also made me think of the Cloud4All PCP concept
2015-10-06T17:27:17 <danayo> (I came across this on the CAST site, which uses their "SpeechStream" toolbar for TTS http://www.cast.org/about#.VhPqIBNVhBc)
2015-10-06T17:30:12 <sepidehshahi> danayo: very interesting examples.
2015-10-06T17:30:32 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-10-06T17:32:53 <sepidehshahi> The tool bar has a move icon to its right. So you can place it anywhere you want. when you close the tool bar it goes back to the bottom left corner but anytime you open it, it opens up in the last place you have closed it! I tried it in a new window and still it remembered!
2015-10-06T17:34:40 <danayo> yes, I noticed that too. but it also inexplicably jumped to the top of the page a few times
2015-10-06T17:42:45 <colinclark> danayo: BrowseAloud is pretty excellent
2015-10-06T17:42:53 <colinclark> strangely familiar in many ways
2015-10-06T17:42:59 <colinclark> and excellently produced
2015-10-06T17:43:15 <danayo> yeah, i\'ve never seen it before

2015-10-06T17:57:56 <taliesin> @jhung are you going to the PhET Meeting?
2015-10-06T17:59:00 <jhung> taliesin: yes. I\'ll be there.
2015-10-06T17:59:05 <jhung> just getting set up
2015-10-06T17:59:37 <taliesin> @jhung ok, are you using the fluid standup room?
2015-10-06T17:59:52 <simonjb> danayo, michelled: I\'ve unlocked my vidyo room, shall we meet there?
2015-10-06T18:00:13 <colinclark> taliesin: The PhET meeting is on Zoom
2015-10-06T18:00:36 <colinclark> Emily sent out a link to attendees
2015-10-06T18:00:45 <michelled> simonjb: sure
2015-10-06T18:01:21 <taliesin> She might have forgotten me.
2015-10-06T18:05:12 <taliesin> @colin I\xe2\x80\x99ve emailed Emily for the link. If she is in the room, can you just let he know that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the link.
2015-10-06T18:06:49 <taliesin> @colinclark oops miss-ype your chat name.
2015-10-06T18:17:04 <taliesin> @colinclark @jhung please let me know if a link forthcoming? cheers.
2015-10-06T18:18:11 <colinclark> taliesin: Sorry, we\'ve been deep in the thick of the meeting
2015-10-06T18:18:17 <colinclark> I can\'t always respond immediately
2015-10-06T18:18:28 <colinclark> Emily will get in touch with you, I think
2015-10-06T18:18:36 <taliesin> Ok, thanks.
2015-10-06T18:29:20 <colinclark> taliesin: Glad you made it :)
