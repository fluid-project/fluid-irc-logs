2015-08-10T17:52:20 <jessm> sepideh: i think we should for CSUN
2015-08-10T17:52:30 <jessm> we might need to wait for CHI\xe2\x80\xa6 what do you think sepideh ?
2015-08-10T17:53:48 <sepideh> I agree. We can set a time this week to talk about this whenever is convenient for you and danayo
2015-08-10T17:54:04 <jessm> sepideh: +1
2015-08-10T17:54:09 <danayo> sepideh jessm what are you thinking of submitting?
2015-08-10T17:54:45 <jessm> danayo: i thought something along the lines of our early 102.1 draft plus some \xe2\x80\x9cuse cases"
2015-08-10T17:55:00 <jessm> danayo: sepideh: i can talk about it today if that works for you all
2015-08-10T17:55:09 <sepideh> works for me
2015-08-10T17:55:14 <danayo> that would be best for me jessm. i\'m away wed-wed coming up

2015-08-10T17:57:27 <sepideh> CHI also a subcommmittee about design. So, I think what you have in mind jessm  may work for that category as wel. but I am just assuming. https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/guide-to-selecting-a-subcommittee-for-submission/#design
2015-08-10T17:57:37 <sepideh> Sure

2015-08-10T18:10:59 <danayo> sepideh, how\'s it going with the quality dashboard? would it help to discuss?
2015-08-10T18:12:51 <michelled> danayo: I was just looking at the big spreadsheet and noticed that we are on the hook for D404.1 in september. "Prosperity4All prosperity indicators, data analytics and usage metrics design and modelling tools"
2015-08-10T18:13:08 <michelled> I\'m actually not sure what it is that we need to do, but it would seem we had better figure that out ;)
2015-08-10T18:13:36 <sepideh> sure, do you want to talk about that after our meeting with jess?
2015-08-10T18:14:41 <danayo> michelled, ok, maybe jessm has a better idea of what that is exactly?
2015-08-10T18:15:33 <danayo> sure sepideh
2015-08-10T18:17:00 <jessm> danayo: michelled: yep, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the radar. this is the work building on Katerina\xe2\x80\x99s 405 work. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a few conversations about this deliverable. The first steps are to take a closer look at Katerina\xe2\x80\x99s work and rationalize it against what 404 promises and then see how likely our meeting that deliverable date is. Gregg, Matthias are on teh same page with us
2015-08-10T18:17:29 <jessm> michelled: was it just a heads-up or is there something particular you were poking about for 404?
2015-08-10T18:18:01 <michelled> danayo was wonder what the next things coming up were and I noticed that I have no notes about that particular deliverable
2015-08-10T18:19:12 <danayo> jessm can you point me to where I can see Katerina\'s work on this (sorry if you already have!)
2015-08-10T18:19:35 <jessm> danayo: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/ANNEX_B.5_Impact_assessment_%26_Web-related_general_analytics
2015-08-10T18:19:38 <jessm> aqui ^
2015-08-10T18:19:45 <danayo> gracias
2015-08-10T18:19:50 <jessm> :)
2015-08-10T18:21:18 <michelled> jessm: does that also cover 404.2?
2015-08-10T18:23:11 <jessm> michelled: yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re both related to it; and both due sept-ish; and both our next thing
