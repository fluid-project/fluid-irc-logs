2015-06-17T18:37:29 <anastasiac> cindyli: question about the FD tool. It seems to me that the language panel uses the stringArrayIndex.lang array as the data that controls the rendering of the buttons; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use the enum in the primary schema. Am I understanding correclty, and if so, why do we not use the actual preference data?

2015-06-17T18:42:47 <cindyli> good catch, anastasiac, the value of stringArrayIndex.lang should be the enum in the primary schema. we should file a jira for it. i guess it was moved there to clearly express the connection of three arrays defined in the stringArrayIndex. But I guess we can add a comment for this connection once we move stringArrayIndex.lang to a proper spot.
