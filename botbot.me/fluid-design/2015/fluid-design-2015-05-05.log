2015-05-05T16:58:57 <michelled> danaayotte: Eva asked me for a link to all the C4A designs, is this the page I should give her? http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Preference+Editing+Tools+Design
2015-05-05T16:59:29 <danaayotte> yes michelled, thanks
2015-05-05T17:00:44 <michelled> np - is there a specific set that she should pay attention to?
2015-05-05T17:01:17 <michelled> I guess the links under 'Latest Wireframes'?
2015-05-05T17:01:22 <danaayotte> not sure what exactly is she looking for? in a mtg now with ET group
2015-05-05T17:02:05 <danaayotte> can send her more specific links if needed
2015-05-05T17:02:17 <michelled> ok, thx
2015-05-05T17:08:56 <danaayotte> colinclark jhung I messed up - meeting with ET group is 2-3
2015-05-05T17:09:03 <danaayotte> so I can meet before or after that
2015-05-05T17:10:16 <michelled> danaayotte, jhung_away, Justin_o: we are getting a student with graphic design skills starting on Monday!
2015-05-05T17:10:41 <danaayotte> excellent michelled
2015-05-05T17:10:43 <michelled> jhung_away: we could get them to do the icons for the new PGA screens
2015-05-05T17:10:55 <michelled> yeah, I'm excited too :)
2015-05-05T17:30:52 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-05-05T17:33:32 <jhung> danaayotte, michelled: that's awesome. I'll get some of our brainstorming down so we have something to show.
2015-05-05T17:34:15 <danaayotte> jhung don't know if you saw my msg but I can't meet at 2:30...ET group meeting is actually 2-3. hope we can bump it to 3 or 3:30 - will that work for you?
2015-05-05T17:34:30 <jhung> danaayotte: yeah that works.
2015-05-05T17:34:34 <danaayotte> great
2015-05-05T17:37:19 <danaayotte> colinclark says 3:30 should be ok jhung
2015-05-05T17:38:43 <jhung> ok danaayotte
2015-05-05T17:39:49 <danaayotte> also jhung - question about outside-in - can I just make changes to my local branch and then push them to github, or do I need to branch first from what's there now since it's been merged?
2015-05-05T17:40:32 <danaayotte> just need to change the image

2015-05-05T18:35:56 <jhung> hi danaayotte sorry I missed your message.
2015-05-05T18:36:53 <jhung> danaayotte: you can make a branch from your fork. Then submit a pull request from that branch when it's ready.

2015-05-05T19:32:12 <danaayotte> thanks jhung
2015-05-05T19:36:40 <jhung> danaayotte: what order should the screens be for the FD tool? (Including the 4 new ones)?
2015-05-05T19:38:55 <danaayotte> well i think we want to keep self-voicing first after language, and speech rate should come after that jhng
2015-05-05T19:39:03 <danaayotte> jhung^
2015-05-05T19:40:16 <jhung> makes sense. Thanks danaayotte
2015-05-05T19:40:20 <danaayotte> otherwise, i think we need to discuss/decide
2015-05-05T19:41:37 <danaayotte> also probably makes sense for captions and visual sounds to be groupd jhung
2015-05-05T19:41:53 <colinclark> danaayotte and jhung, are you guys ready to chat now?
2015-05-05T19:43:03 <danaayotte> ready colinclark
2015-05-05T19:43:15 <colinclark> shall we meet in the fluid_standup room on vidyo?
2015-05-05T19:43:16 <jhung> ready too colinclark and danaayotte
2015-05-05T19:43:24 <jhung> sure
2015-05-05T19:43:36 <danaayotte> I think Jess_ might join us
2015-05-05T19:59:32 * michelled joined the channel
2015-05-05T20:23:34 <jhung> danaayotte: I've come up with the following order of screens. Let me know if this is what you had in mind\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-05-05T20:24:17 <jhung> Language > Screen Reader > Speech Rate > Captions > Show Audio > Text Size > Sticky Keys > Onscreen Keyboard.
