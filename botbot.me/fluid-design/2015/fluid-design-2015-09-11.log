2015-09-11T17:27:47 <jessm> jhung: I\xe2\x80\x99m on the cusp of setting up a mtg. and dragging you into some simulation (text-ifying) on the Lumen project. we can all chat Monday to sort out the timing of this, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be helping the sim-creator with some questions he has about how best to make text alternatives to the sims. let\xe2\x80\x99s talk when you get a chance so i can catch you up
2015-09-11T17:46:07 <jhung> jessm: I have time now. Let me know when you want to chat.

2015-09-11T17:59:35 <sepidehshahi> Hi jhung, I have made some changes on the CA tool. please let me know what you think: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gy2tld4w5a69q2u/CA%20Tool-Interactive%20Version-2.pdf?dl=0
2015-09-11T17:59:43 <sepidehshahi> thx
2015-09-11T17:59:48 <jhung> sepidehshahi: sure I'll take a look.
2015-09-11T17:59:55 <sepidehshahi> thx
2015-09-11T18:01:40 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I *love* it!!! :D
2015-09-11T18:01:55 <sepidehshahi> ;)
2015-09-11T18:02:32 <jhung> sepidehshahi: it's the sort of thing I was hoping for - a simple yet concise solution for what we wanted.
2015-09-11T18:02:49 <sepidehshahi> cool, we still have problems with small slices though
2015-09-11T18:03:13 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-11T18:04:43 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I see. One thing we can try is if the user is using a mouse or keyboard, when hover or focused on a thin slice, it magnifies so you can see the slice and values more clearly.
2015-09-11T18:05:51 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. what about mobile applications when you need to touch the slice?
2015-09-11T18:07:42 <jhung> sepidehshahi: One thing I do see on some  Android is if there are multiple touch items in tight proximity, there's a quick pop-up showing the possible values and the user selects one.
2015-09-11T18:08:14 <jhung> in practice it's actually quite nice because the cost of selecting the wrong link is costly on mobile (slow load times, etc.).
2015-09-11T18:08:50 <jhung> also the icons for Add and Sort may be confusing. But i know they're not final. :)
2015-09-11T18:09:05 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right! I have seen that pop-up. in some applications. Sure we can suggest that type of behaviour for small slices. thx
2015-09-11T18:09:22 <sepidehshahi> yes, just placeholders :)
2015-09-11T18:16:44 <jhung> excellent sepidehshahi. I really like where this is heading.
2015-09-11T18:17:20 <sepidehshahi> yes, I am excited about it as well!
