2015-10-28T14:51:33 <danayo> hi jhung, just to let you know - I replaced the custom adaptations image with another that I found that was larger/higher quality. I don\'t like the image quite as much but I couldn\'t find exactly the same one and it was looking pretty pixelated at actual size.
2015-10-28T14:52:15 <danayo> also - is 150ppi good enough resolution for printing the posters?
2015-10-28T14:55:05 <jhung> I think maybe higher? 150 ppi is good for viewing at 6 feet or more. I figure most people will be within 2-3 feet of the posters danayo
2015-10-28T14:55:27 <danayo> ok, so 300 jhung?
2015-10-28T14:55:54 <jhung> That would be safe danayo. I hope our images can handle that resolution.
2015-10-28T14:56:19 <danayo> ok, I\'ll export them again at 300
2015-10-28T15:01:58 <danayo> jhung, could you take a look at them and let me know what you think? i\'m a little worried about the overhead projector image as well as the walrus and squid, and maybe even the new custom adaptation one (although that image was quite high res so I\'m not sure why it doesn\'t look better)
2015-10-28T15:02:39 <jhung> ok danayo. I\'ll take a look.
2015-10-28T15:02:49 <danayo> thanks
2015-10-28T15:08:24 <jhung> The overhead projector I think is fine danayo since there isn\'t much detail that is important.
2015-10-28T15:09:19 <jhung> The adaptations image though I can see is a bit grainy. Could be because the original was grainy too. I\'ll process it and upload a new copy to dropbox and you can update the image and see if it looks better danayo?
2015-10-28T15:10:16 <danayo> sure jhung, what are you doing to process it?
2015-10-28T15:11:18 <jhung> I\'m going to use Lightroom to denoise and sharpen it danayo.
2015-10-28T15:11:48 <danayo> cool, thanks jhung
2015-10-28T15:12:09 <danayo> walrus and jellyfish might need same, jhung?
2015-10-28T15:14:13 <jhung> Out of context what you just said sounds hilarious. danayo.
2015-10-28T15:14:21 <danayo> :D
2015-10-28T15:14:29 <jhung> I\'ll process that image too.
2015-10-28T15:14:32 <danayo> process the walrus!
2015-10-28T15:14:54 <danayo> sharpen the jellyfish!
2015-10-28T15:15:22 <jhung> lol
2015-10-28T15:27:44 <jhung> there wasn\'t much I could do about the jellyfish and walrus danayo. I\'m afraid they were already too compressed.
2015-10-28T15:27:55 <danayo> oh nooooooooooo
2015-10-28T15:28:14 <danayo> yeah, i tried to find another image of that, but no luck
2015-10-28T15:31:33 <jhung> The updated images are in TIFF format danayo. You can find them in the Assets folder
2015-10-28T15:31:46 <danayo> thanks jhung
2015-10-28T15:33:10 * clown has quit
2015-10-28T15:34:08 <jhung> btw danayo, you can do a reverse image search on google by uploading an image. To do this go to images.google.com and press the little camera icon in the search field.
2015-10-28T15:34:37 <jhung> I did the search on our jellyfish and came up with nothing.., at least nothing that was better than what we had.
2015-10-28T15:35:17 <danayo> cool! I had no idea you could do that!
2015-10-28T15:35:38 <jhung> The google hive mind is all-knowing and all-seeing.

2015-10-28T17:04:32 <danayo> hey jhung, colinclark recommends we use only CC-licensed images for our posters (and where they\'re not CC but labelled for reuse we check the license)
2015-10-28T17:05:29 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-10-28T17:09:02 <jhung> danayo: I\'ll double check the images I used.
2015-10-28T17:13:18 <danayo> thanks
2015-10-28T17:26:03 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-28T17:32:04 <jhung> danayo: the overhead projector is CC Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 licensed.

2015-10-28T17:41:59 <danayo> oh great, the laptop sweater is also 2.0 Generic
2015-10-28T17:44:54 <danayo> jhung colinclark do you know how I can find the license for the image I got from this page? http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/workspace/byod-gives-us-bad-backs-says-doctor-119329
2015-10-28T17:45:18 <colinclark> which image did you use?
2015-10-28T17:46:07 <jhung> danayo: it\'s probably stock image - so licensed from the company that has the rights.
2015-10-28T17:46:18 <danayo> the woman at the laptop rubbing her neck
2015-10-28T17:46:49 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I came across this project yesterday. It\xe2\x80\x99s very different than what we are trying to do for self-assessment. But I thought that they have a nice approach for documenting emotions. There is also a demo video that is shown in a related TED talk but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it anywhere http://www.aqworks.com/en/work/moodstone/
2015-10-28T17:47:42 <colinclark> danayo: The short answer is that unless you see a specific declaration of license, you have no rights to reuse an image
2015-10-28T17:48:04 <colinclark> these look like stock photos probably purchased by TechWeek specifically for use in their article
2015-10-28T17:48:13 <colinclark> so we can\'t reuse them
2015-10-28T17:48:54 <danayo> ok thanks colinclark
2015-10-28T17:48:54 <jhung> ugh, I just did a image search of Wikipedia for "sore neck". I recommend NOT searching that if you just had lunch. :(
2015-10-28T17:49:07 <colinclark> eek
2015-10-28T17:49:34 <colinclark> On a completely unrelated note, what does the laptop sweater signify to you danayo?
2015-10-28T17:49:41 <danayo> thanks for that sepidehshahi
2015-10-28T17:50:10 <sepidehshahi> np
2015-10-28T17:50:16 <danayo> colinclark the poster line is "Enjoy custom adaptations?" ... "So do we"
2015-10-28T17:50:22 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-28T17:50:57 <jhung> danayo: I came across this which I thought was cool. Not related to what we have, but maybe we can use it in the future: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_in_the_arts#/media/File:LisaBufanoOrangeQueenAnneTableLegProstheses.jpg
2015-10-28T17:51:42 <danayo> just emailed you a Dropbox link to all the posters colinclark
2015-10-28T17:51:51 <colinclark> cool

2015-10-28T19:04:14 <colinclark> danayo: yup
2015-10-28T19:08:44 <colinclark> I think I would mention the license in each case
2015-10-28T19:09:03 <colinclark> So on the gecko, you can remove the ?no_redirect part from the URL
2015-10-28T19:09:23 <colinclark> and should add "CC0" to it
2015-10-28T19:09:31 <colinclark> that particular image is public domain, so it\'s not actually necessary
2015-10-28T19:09:34 <danayo> I updated them actually colinclark
2015-10-28T19:09:36 <danayo> with the CC
2015-10-28T19:09:38 <danayo> check the latest
2015-10-28T19:09:40 <colinclark> hmm
2015-10-28T19:09:48 <colinclark> I think i don\'t understand
2015-10-28T19:10:09 <danayo> I re-exported the files
2015-10-28T19:10:18 <danayo> sorry for confusion
2015-10-28T19:10:26 <colinclark> no, that part I understood
2015-10-28T19:10:30 <colinclark> it\'s Dropbox
2015-10-28T19:10:34 <colinclark> apparently refreshing once isn\'t enough :P
2015-10-28T19:10:37 <danayo> ah
2015-10-28T19:11:11 <colinclark> Okay so the expression "CC by CC0" doesn\'t actually make sense for the Gecko
2015-10-28T19:11:19 <colinclark> "CC-by" is a type of license
2015-10-28T19:11:41 <colinclark> That\'s the shortform for the Creative Commons Attribution License
2015-10-28T19:11:46 <colinclark> whereas this image is CC0
2015-10-28T19:11:50 <colinclark> aka plain old public domain :)
2015-10-28T19:12:01 <colinclark> "The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work"
2015-10-28T19:12:28 <colinclark> So you can just say "CC0" or use the cool 0 icon
2015-10-28T19:12:58 <danayo> ok, and the others should be CC BY 2.0 etc?
2015-10-28T19:13:30 <colinclark> The overhead projector looks right
2015-10-28T19:15:10 <colinclark> I am having trouble typing in all the URLs
2015-10-28T19:15:20 <colinclark> Any chance you can paste the URLs to the actual images in here for me
2015-10-28T19:15:22 <colinclark> ?
2015-10-28T19:16:11 <colinclark> The Becky Stern poster is right
2015-10-28T19:16:19 <danayo> sure, one sec
2015-10-28T19:16:32 <colinclark> It\'s just the headstand one
2015-10-28T19:16:41 <danayo> yes, it should be this commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bury_your_head_in_the_sand.jpg
2015-10-28T19:16:45 <danayo> ack
2015-10-28T19:17:15 <danayo> https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bury_your_head_in_the_sand.jpg
2015-10-28T19:17:40 <colinclark> ok, great
2015-10-28T19:17:53 <colinclark> So it seems fine
2015-10-28T19:18:19 <danayo> or I guess I could use the direct flickr link https://www.flickr.com/photos/jar0d/6066734168/
2015-10-28T19:18:33 <colinclark> Either\'s fine
2015-10-28T19:18:41 <danayo> ok
2015-10-28T19:18:44 <colinclark> I\'d recommend this:
2015-10-28T19:18:48 <colinclark> Attribute
2015-10-28T19:18:51 <colinclark> Link
2015-10-28T19:18:51 <colinclark> License
2015-10-28T19:18:55 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-10-28T19:19:02 <colinclark> So the author\'s name
2015-10-28T19:19:18 <colinclark> a short link to the image (which will contain a link to the license)
2015-10-28T19:19:21 <colinclark> and then list the license
2015-10-28T19:19:31 <colinclark> either using CC\'s nice icons or just writing them as you hvae
2015-10-28T19:19:45 <danayo> ok great
2015-10-28T19:19:51 <danayo> so this - image: Alexas_Fotos, pixabay.com/p-914524, CC0
2015-10-28T19:19:57 <colinclark> yep, exactly
2015-10-28T19:20:06 <danayo> and this - image: Sander van der Wel, flickr.com/photos/jar0d/6066734168, CC BY SA-2.0
2015-10-28T19:20:11 <colinclark> yup
2015-10-28T19:20:17 <danayo> great. THANK YOU!
2015-10-28T19:20:28 <colinclark> sorry this stuff is so boring :)
2015-10-28T19:20:34 <danayo> :D
2015-10-28T19:20:40 <colinclark> but you\'ll have people from Creative Commons hanging out at your booth
2015-10-28T19:20:49 <colinclark> so it will feel great to have all your attributions in order :)
2015-10-28T19:21:01 <danayo> yes, you have saved us some potential embarassment :)

2015-10-28T14:17:38 <danayo> goodmorning sepidehshahi - I just noticed your comment in the channel from yesterday regarding doing the interviews in English
2015-10-28T14:18:19 <danayo> perhaps we can ask in the email if they would be willing to do an interview in English

2015-10-28T14:20:23 <sepidehshahi> Good morning danayo. yes we have a problem there. I have sent out English invitations to developers and vendors. But I am trying to translate the invitations for the AT users. if they respond, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll try my best to find volunteers who can do the interviews in other languages
