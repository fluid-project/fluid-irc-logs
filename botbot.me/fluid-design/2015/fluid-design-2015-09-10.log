2015-09-10T17:40:30 <sepidehshahi> danayo I have added the mockup to db: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sw6nbfktoad0eof/CA%20Tool-Interactive%20Version.pdf?dl=0
2015-09-10T17:44:03 <sepidehshahi> There were some issues with adding a new section. When you add a section by selecting \xe2\x80\x98Add new section\xe2\x80\x99 a section is added. here, we have some problems with calculating the size of the new section, the total value and the percentage label.
2015-09-10T17:44:42 <sepidehshahi> So, in my sketch I was trying to add the value once you try to add the new section
2015-09-10T17:44:59 <sepidehshahi> danayo: and jhung ^
2015-09-10T17:45:08 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I'm taking a look now.
2015-09-10T17:45:58 <jhung> I see what you mean. I have some ideas sepidehshahi.
2015-09-10T17:46:16 <sepidehshahi> great
2015-09-10T17:46:28 <jhung> let me see if I can do something quick in illustrator sepidehshahi
2015-09-10T17:46:34 <sepidehshahi> sure
2015-09-10T17:48:47 <danayo> it's looking good sepidehshahi. I think it might be too much to show the existing entry along with new entry at once  - I had imagined a separate/new dialog box would open when add new was selected - but we can discuss at the crit
2015-09-10T17:50:31 <sepidehshahi> The other problem is with the play button. If we want to entirely integrate it in the playbar, similar to Youtube approach, it would be really small and hard to select by touch. I used a larger play button. However, it causes problems when we have very small sections in the chart under the play button the section label will overlap the play button.
2015-09-10T17:51:26 <danayo> also I had hoped the dashed lines would convey a temporary slice-size until values are entered - and maybe total value could be temporarily greyed-out, or could be removed, percent value could be empty until a value is entered
2015-09-10T17:51:58 <danayo> sepidehshahi, jhung ^
2015-09-10T17:53:12 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-10T17:53:48 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s right, I followed your strategy and used the dash lines yp show a temporary state. and the labels are not visible/ or greyed out when a new section is being added
2015-09-10T17:53:53 * alanharnum has quit
2015-09-10T17:55:51 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo - I don't think I'll have time to draw something up in time for the crit. I hope I'll be able to explain it verbally. :D

2015-09-10T18:02:08 <sepidehshahi> Where do we want to have the design crit? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if the audio is working in the collab room
2015-09-10T18:04:05 <gtirloni> a technician was supposed to check the room at 1:30pm today, but i don't have the current status

2015-09-10T18:04:39 <jhung> sepidehshahi: I'm logged in the Fluid Stand-up room. Maybe do this around the cart even though the audio is bad?
2015-09-10T18:05:00 <jhung> Or maybe individually at personal computers?
2015-09-10T18:06:15 <sepidehshahi> I have setup the cart jhung
2015-09-10T18:06:41 <jhung> ok
2015-09-10T18:06:54 <sepidehshahi> everybody we will have the design crit around the cart. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the pie chart authoring tool design

2015-09-10T19:21:35 <jessm> jhung: ah, we might need to stand closer again?

2015-09-10T19:24:09 <jessm> jhung: should be momentarily \xe2\x80\x94 or a bit bigger than momentarily
