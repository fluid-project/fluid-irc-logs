2015-10-22T15:19:44 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo I have added two rough sketches to the google doc. They are listed at the end of the doc
2015-10-22T15:21:07 <danayo> yes! I had a listen sepidehshahi , they\'re great
2015-10-22T15:21:16 <danayo> the last one is really interesting
2015-10-22T15:22:18 <danayo> I think we may also want to try slowing it down a little, so that the units can be counted more easily (although I know we also talked about keeping the total duration really short)

2015-10-22T15:51:07 <sepidehshahi> perfect. thx

2015-10-22T19:21:45 <danayo> jhung: I keep imagining the sound of a creaking leather jacket for the movement of john travoltage\'s arm :)
2015-10-22T19:21:59 <Bosmon> One could say, for example, "I AM UNABLE TO SONALISE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT"
2015-10-22T19:22:14 <Bosmon> It would be senseless to say, "I am unable to sonify what you are talking about"
2015-10-22T19:24:28 <jhung> ^ that could mean that you can not repeat what is said because of some interference in the signal.
2015-10-22T19:24:54 <jhung> "I can not sonify what you are saying because the music is too loud."

2015-10-22T19:37:00 <Bosmon> Right - but that wouldn\'t be what you wanted it to mean :)
2015-10-22T19:38:07 <Bosmon> Although I guess "audiblise" would be another possibility - in that what you do when you "visualise" something is that you apprehend something from what is "visual" - and so this would be the analogue of that for something that is "audible"
2015-10-22T19:42:13 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-22T19:43:46 <jhung> If I am sonible, I should be sonilised.
2015-10-22T19:48:27 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you have a few minutes to talk about our next round of sonification sketches?
