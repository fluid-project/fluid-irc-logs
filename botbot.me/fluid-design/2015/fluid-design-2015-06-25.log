b'2015-06-25T19:46:48 <maozillah> i don\xe2\x80\x99t know if a very detailed quantification is valuable but more generalized perhaps e.g. if a preference has 4 thumbs up vs here are favourite preferences of yours
2015-06-25T19:48:44 <danayo> yes maozillah
2015-06-25T19:48:57 <simonjb> I think it might also be interesting to relate preferences to context -- not necessarily to test results but maybe in the sense of a user assessment -- these preferences worked well for me on this test (independent of result)
2015-06-25T19:49:32 <maozillah> mmm yea simonjb i agree, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just, i liked this
2015-06-25T19:50:05 <danayo> yeah, so after taking the test the user would be prompted to note what worked for them in some way
2015-06-25T19:50:51 <maozillah> yes!
2015-06-25T19:51:41 <simonjb> maybe for some online tests I like one set of preferences but maybe for another type of test I like a different -- this is pure speculation -- but for example, some tests might have lots of prose and others are more concise/symbolic (I\'m thinking say literature vs math)
2015-06-25T19:52:20 <danayo> yes I think it will definitely be subject or "test-type" or even "question-type" dependent
2015-06-25T19:55:24 <danayo> maozillah can you walk me through FLUID-5678 now?
2015-06-25T19:55:37 <maozillah> yep! was just gonna msg u aha
2015-06-25T19:56:15 <maozillah> do you wanna send me a link to the vidyo? i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to do the vidyo process from my end
2015-06-25T19:56:32 <danayo> sure
2015-06-25T19:58:00 <sepideh> danayo: and colinclark, here is what I have made based on Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s feedback. I\xe2\x80\x99m junst not sure about the connection between the components and each SP and Kevin is not here to confirm. Can you plz have a look and give me feedback regarding the connections? thx  https://www.dropbox.com/s/przireyrwfpjuci/SPs%20interactions%20with%20P4A.pdf?dl=0

2015-06-25T15:21:39 <colinclark> sepideh: I love what you\'ve done with the idea of "models" in your new diagram!
2015-06-25T15:22:16 <colinclark> The infrastructure, user, and economic models in this diagram: https://www.dropbox.com/s/przireyrwfpjuci/SPs%20interactions%20with%20P4A.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-25T15:22:18 <colinclark> :)
2015-06-25T15:22:41 <colinclark> It\'s really great to see, with the arrows, how the models and then the tools are inputs to the infrastructure
2015-06-25T15:22:50 <colinclark> really nicely done, sepideh
2015-06-25T15:23:33 <sepideh> Thanks colinclark, do I need to change anything?
2015-06-25T15:23:54 <colinclark> I guess the only thing might be the arrow along the left
2015-06-25T15:24:00 <colinclark> "SP2 Support Developers"
2015-06-25T15:24:10 <colinclark> Everything else in the diagram, mostly seems to be "things"
2015-06-25T15:24:17 <colinclark> Models, Tools and Frameworks, Applications
2015-06-25T15:24:24 <colinclark> whereas "Support Developers" sounds a bit more like an activity
2015-06-25T15:24:34 <colinclark> maybe that\'s the point?
2015-06-25T15:24:42 <sepideh> Good point. Developer\xe2\x80\x99s support?
2015-06-25T15:24:55 <colinclark> I\'m not sure
2015-06-25T15:25:07 <colinclark> What kinds of things do we imagine would be part of "Supporting Developers?"
2015-06-25T15:25:20 <sepideh> This is Dow description: is focused on providing comprehensive support to developers to make it easier and less expensive for them to develop solutions and to enhance the market reach and penetration of their products.
2015-06-25T15:25:25 <colinclark> right
2015-06-25T15:25:29 <colinclark> I wonder if that\'s actually a few things...
2015-06-25T15:25:38 <colinclark> the Developer Space, the Quality Infrastructure, and the Dashboard?
2015-06-25T15:25:50 <colinclark> "Developer Support Tools"
2015-06-25T15:25:55 <colinclark> "Developer Support Platform"
2015-06-25T15:25:56 <colinclark> I\'m not sure
2015-06-25T15:26:07 <colinclark> just thinking aloud
2015-06-25T15:26:50 <sepideh> Let\xe2\x80\x99s use tools for now and I can change it if something better came up

2015-06-25T15:52:00 <danayo> sure sepideh. just chatting with jessm, can i ping you when I\'m done?

2015-06-25T19:18:48 <murilocrivellari> hey sepideh, how did you upload the sonification sketches to the wiki page?
2015-06-25T19:19:28 <sepideh> you can add attachement to the page when you are editing, or just drag and drop them to a specific section
2015-06-25T19:19:40 <sepideh> Do you want me come to your desk?
2015-06-25T19:20:00 <murilocrivellari> I\'ll go to yours :)
2015-06-25T19:20:11 <sepideh> sure
2015-06-25T19:24:47 <sepideh> danayo: I had a chat with Kevin prior to our crit. I am updating the chart now
2015-06-25T19:26:04 <danayo> great sepideh
2015-06-25T19:39:13 <simonjb> hi danayo, I was pretty quiet during the crit this afternoon -- I was really trying to think about the problem space and offer something helpful but it\'s definitely a hard one -- there was one avenue that I was thinking about after the meeting and chatted briefly with colinclark about
2015-06-25T19:39:51 <simonjb> it\'s the suggestion of maozillah to explore an annotated history of preferences -- a \'journal\'
2015-06-25T19:40:06 <simonjb> I think this could be a really interesting thing to explore
2015-06-25T19:40:44 <simonjb> keep a track of preferene changes over time with an opportunity for the user to annotate and keep notes
2015-06-25T19:41:45 <simonjb> and maybe different preferences, or different modes of alternatives were very helpful or not-helpful in a particular context (such as subject, type of test, or otherwise)
2015-06-25T19:42:07 <danayo> thanks simonjb. I agree that would be really interesting. I like that it\'s based in preferences but keeps it open and personal
2015-06-25T19:42:18 <danayo> I think that could be a really good approach
2015-06-25T19:42:37 <simonjb> and having a record of what was successful and what wasn\'t might be really good to have if one encounters a similiar situation in the future
2015-06-25T19:42:46 <danayo> right
2015-06-25T19:43:45 <danayo> and maybe there is a way to loosely quantify it, or at least try to identify and represent/communicate patterns
2015-06-25T19:44:25 <danayo> but where there isn\'t, the user still has the history to refer to
2015-06-25T19:44:29 <danayo> simonjb
2015-06-25T19:44:55 <simonjb> yes, there could be a way to quantify, I think if it\'s open ended and flexible
2015-06-25T19:45:10 <simonjb> could at least be qualified -- this worked, this didn\'t or such
2015-06-25T19:45:16 <danayo> yeah
