2015-10-20T20:54:35 <danayo> sepidehshahi, do you want to listen/discuss the distributed proportional sketches that you and murilo created? I had some questions about it - wasn't sure what all you were mapping
2015-10-20T21:02:19 <sepidehshahi> danayo: that was a tricky one. I was trying to sketch out what Simon discribed in one of our meeting. So, we have the 100% value at the background, and then each segment is distributed over that 100% background. So the more frequently you hear a sound a larger segment it represents. So, in my sketch I think I have divided the duration of each segment to 4 pieces and play them in loops over the duration of the 100% value
