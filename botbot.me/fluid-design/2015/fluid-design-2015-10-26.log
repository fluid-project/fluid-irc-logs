2015-10-26T13:54:59 <jhung> Justin_o: so I sort of figured out a solution to PDF previews crashing the github desktop app.
2015-10-26T13:55:17 <Justin_o> jhung: really, what's that?
2015-10-26T13:55:37 <jhung> I removed pdf files from being tracked. Now it doesn't try to render it, instead it just shows the XML.
2015-10-26T13:56:11 <Justin_o> won't that mean they won't be committed though?
2015-10-26T13:57:19 <jhung> it can still be committed. For whatever reason, for git lfs, they ask you do an additional step of doing 'git track *.<ext>' before committing your binaries.
2015-10-26T13:57:46 <jhung> I had pdf files tracked that way, but removing it seems to be better.
2015-10-26T13:59:47 <Justin_o> jhung: are you sure they are using git lfs then, and not just standard git?
2015-10-26T14:01:37 * danayo joined the channel
2015-10-26T14:02:00 <jhung> Justin_o: ah. Good point. So in effect I'm just using standard git for PDFs just to avoid the crashing issue on the desktop.
2015-10-26T14:02:15 <jhung> That's probably not ideal since some of the PDFs we use get very large.
2015-10-26T14:02:51 <Justin_o> jhung: yep
2015-10-26T14:04:35 <Justin_o> jhung: unless the xml diff's efficiently enough that we could store the changes and it wouldn't be that large, but i'm guess because these are images that they won't

2015-10-26T18:18:55 <danayo> woops jhung meant to ping you here :)
2015-10-26T18:21:25 <jhung> danayo: lol np. Do you want me to take a look at that file?
2015-10-26T18:21:57 <danayo> sure jhung
2015-10-26T18:22:27 <danayo> let me know what you think and also wanted a last check to make sure everything looks good
2015-10-26T18:24:59 <jhung> ha. I like your revision to the time machine line danayo. :)
2015-10-26T18:25:07 <danayo> great jhung
2015-10-26T18:26:56 <jhung> I find the text alignment a bit odd danayo. I think mainly because the image breaks the flow of text.
2015-10-26T18:31:25 <jhung> danayo: I made a suggestion. Let me know what you think...
2015-10-26T18:34:01 <danayo> yeah, i was struggling with that jhung, i'll take a look

2015-10-26T18:50:18 <danayo> jhung, I'm not sure about the two-tone background...I tried re-aligning the text, and I think it looks ok, what do you think?
2015-10-26T18:54:11 * clown joined the channel
2015-10-26T19:01:26 <jhung> yeah looks better danayo. Let's go with that.
2015-10-26T19:02:26 <danayo> ok, thanks jhung
2015-10-26T19:12:04 <sepidehshahi> danayo: do you think if I should overwrite our original interview questions with the new and organized version? or should we keep both copies?
2015-10-26T19:14:26 <danayo> I would keep a copy of the original sepidehshahi
2015-10-26T19:14:45 <danayo> since you used those for some of the interviews, right?
2015-10-26T19:17:21 <sepidehshahi> not yet. we have two google docs for interview questions now. One is what Katerina and I have put together last week and it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit messy and the other is the copy I worked on today and it\xe2\x80\x99s more organized. We can talk about it in our meeting:)
