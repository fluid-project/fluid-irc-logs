2015-09-09T15:16:05 <danayo> Hi simonjb, here is the wireframe flow that I've been working on for UIO security integration. definitely a work in progress but thought you might want to take a look - let me know if you have any questions https://www.dropbox.com/s/j31avdakalgd1br/uioptions%20privacy%20copy.pdf?dl=0
2015-09-09T15:20:20 <simonjb> thanks danayo

2015-09-09T17:48:52 <danayo> colinclark I finally just read through this whole page https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Security_and_Privacy and found it very helpful, thank you!
2015-09-09T17:56:12 <colinclark> oh wow, no problem
2015-09-09T17:56:14 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it was helpful
2015-09-09T17:57:57 <danayo> it was, and nice diagrams too!
2015-09-09T17:58:43 <colinclark> Some of the details in the diagrams aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite right anymore
2015-09-09T17:58:56 <danayo> I wondered if it was totally up to date
2015-09-09T17:58:59 <colinclark> but simonjb is in a good position to point out how things have evolved
2015-09-09T17:59:04 <danayo> for sure
2015-09-09T17:59:24 <danayo> we talked some about the flow manager and anonymity yesterday - sounds like that has changed somewhat
2015-09-09T18:00:08 <colinclark> I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more or less consistent with this document
2015-09-09T18:00:13 <colinclark> with the caveat that we confirmed today
2015-09-09T18:00:27 <colinclark> which is that anonymous preference sets will be immutable after the point of creation
2015-09-09T18:00:58 <colinclark> as opposed to the more complex scenario where there are things like reset codes or phrases
2015-09-09T18:01:44 <colinclark> and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure to what degree we will ever have the kind of token indirection that is discussed below Figure 3 in that document
2015-09-09T18:02:19 <danayo> ok, thanks colinclark
2015-09-09T18:09:00 <sepidehshahi> danayo and jhung do you have some time today to talk about sonification next steps?
2015-09-09T18:09:48 <jhung> sepidehshahi: yep. What time?
2015-09-09T18:11:18 <danayo> sepidehshahi, jhung, how about 3pm ET?
2015-09-09T18:11:38 <jhung> works for me danayo, sepidehshahi
