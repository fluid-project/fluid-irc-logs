2015-10-08T19:48:46 <danayo> great
2015-10-08T19:49:45 <danayo> I was just looking at how jhung has been using github for his Lumen design work https://github.com/jhung/design-artifacts/tree/master/mockups/lumen-learning/Utility%20Sim
2015-10-08T19:51:11 <sepidehshahi> oh, great! let me see. I have never used Github, so it may take me a bit longer to learn how to use it.
2015-10-08T19:55:28 <danayo> no worries sepidehshahi, I am still learning how to use it too :)
2015-10-08T19:56:48 <danayo> simonjb: I put the latest UIO security wireframes on the gpii wiki page https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Security_Dashboard
2015-10-08T19:57:11 <simonjb> thanks very much danayo
2015-10-08T19:57:16 <danayo> np

2015-10-08T20:23:29 <sepidehshahi> danayo: on our SP1 list, I have grayed out all the activities related to D102. Do you think if I should keep them that way or if I should remove them from the list?
2015-10-08T20:24:31 <danayo> sepidehshahi: could you send me a link to the doc?
2015-10-08T20:25:02 <sepidehshahi> sure https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZD6Zczb6ZLy-WRP7XMMF-AHiZUKqQB1-I0ScrQxWYQM/edit?usp=sharing
2015-10-08T20:28:44 <danayo> why are you greying them out sepidehshahi? I thought we wanted to capture both 102.2 and 103.1?
2015-10-08T20:31:09 <sepidehshahi> I have removed anything else that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t either 102 or 103 from the original doc. and then, I have greyed out the ones that were purely 102. So, the ones that are still highlighted are either 103 or a mix of 102 and 103 tasks
2015-10-08T20:32:04 <sepidehshahi> I can revert them back to the same color but it will be very similar to what we had in the original doc.
2015-10-08T20:34:04 <danayo> ah - and that's because the purely 102 items are all completed?
2015-10-08T20:34:51 <sepidehshahi> technically because JIBS is reponsible for the 102 items, so maybe they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on our to do list? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\xa6 what do you think danayo
2015-10-08T20:35:22 * cindyli has quit
2015-10-08T20:35:32 <sepidehshahi> Some of the 102 items are completed and some are still due
2015-10-08T20:36:43 <danayo> ok, I see, if I understand correctly, what we were hoping to do was capture all of the IDRC to-do items, right? in that case I would just delete anything that is not IDRC's responsibility
2015-10-08T20:37:49 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s what I understood from our conversation the other day. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just remove the 102 tasks to see what we are left with. Thanks a lot danayo :)
2015-10-08T20:41:01 <danayo> sounds good!

2015-10-08T16:44:12 * Bosmon2 joined the channel
2015-10-08T16:44:56 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-10-08T16:45:11 <jhung> taliesin: I\'m on version 3.5.2 (017)
2015-10-08T16:45:57 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-08T16:46:52 <taliesin> I upgraded to the latest version (3.5.2) as suggested on login. The app no longer runs now - crashes on startup.
2015-10-08T16:47:02 <gtirloni> taliesin: which operating system are you using?
2015-10-08T16:47:30 <taliesin> Mac OSX 10.10.3
2015-10-08T16:47:49 <taliesin> Yosemite
2015-10-08T16:49:05 <gtirloni> i\'d try rebooting the computer just in case something from the older version is stuck running in the background. other folks here updated on mac osx and it seems to be working
2015-10-08T16:49:38 <gtirloni> if it doesn\'t work, i\'d remove the uninstall the app (delete it from the apps folder) and go to htts://conf.inclusivedesign.ca to retrieve a new copy
2015-10-08T16:49:49 <gtirloni> https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca
2015-10-08T16:50:09 <taliesin> I did the retrieval already with a fresh install, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t rebooted.
2015-10-08T16:50:35 <taliesin> I\xe2\x80\x99ll reboot. Thanks. See you later.

2015-10-08T17:13:40 <taliesin> hi again, re Vidyo upgrade. Still no success.
2015-10-08T17:15:00 * colinclark has quit
2015-10-08T17:15:05 <taliesin> I uninstalled, Rebooted, Reinstalled and still, the app crashes on startup.
2015-10-08T17:16:18 <taliesin> Is there someone I can call? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the appropriate forum. I just through I would check here first.

2015-10-08T17:19:46 <gtirloni> taliesin: let me try to find the old version so you can use that temporarily, one sec

2015-10-08T17:20:08 <taliesin> @gtirloni thanks :-)
2015-10-08T17:28:25 <gtirloni> taliesin: i\'m uploading the client to a place where you\'ll be able to download it from. in the meantime, please uninstall the version of vidyodesktop that\'s currently installed
2015-10-08T17:28:49 <taliesin> Ok, thanks a million.

2015-10-08T17:31:50 <gtirloni> that is the previous version. if it prompts you to upgrade, please say no and i believe it gives you the options to "not prompt me anymore about this version"
2015-10-08T17:32:29 <gtirloni> hmm the url seems wrong, one sec
2015-10-08T17:32:40 <taliesin> @gtirloni eyp, url is not good.

2015-10-08T17:32:51 <gtirloni> this one ^
2015-10-08T17:33:13 <taliesin> got it now
2015-10-08T17:33:36 <gtirloni> *fingers crossed*
2015-10-08T17:33:40 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-10-08T17:33:56 <taliesin> It started :-)
2015-10-08T17:35:02 <taliesin> gtirloni: looks like I got it :-)
2015-10-08T17:35:07 <gtirloni> nice!
2015-10-08T17:35:35 <taliesin> Can I share that link with my class mates in case any one else has trouble?
2015-10-08T17:35:35 <gtirloni> you won\'t be missing anything by sticking to this version for now, sorry about the inconvenience
2015-10-08T17:35:41 <gtirloni> yes
2015-10-08T17:36:10 <taliesin> So, should I just stil with version 4 until the next upgrade?
2015-10-08T17:36:28 <taliesin> *stick with* I mean
2015-10-08T17:37:15 <gtirloni> yep, in your case that will be better. we will work with out vendor on this one..
2015-10-08T17:37:30 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-08T17:37:34 <gtirloni> does it give you the option to ignore version 3.5 when it prompts to upgrade?
2015-10-08T17:37:44 <gtirloni> i worry it might be bugging you all the time to upgrade, which would be unfortunate
2015-10-08T17:38:21 <taliesin> @gtirloni: OK, great! And aain, thganks so much! Yes, there are 2 buttons: Later and Install Now.
2015-10-08T17:39:31 <gtirloni> cool, yw
2015-10-08T17:40:44 <taliesin> Again thanks. We have an improtant guest speaker coming tomorrow, David Best.

2015-10-08T17:59:46 <danayo> Hi sepidehshahi, do you want to add comments directly to the survey results spreadsheet? I don\'t see any in there yet - are you putting them somewhere else?
2015-10-08T18:01:37 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, you can add them diectly there. I have started adding comments yet.
2015-10-08T18:01:56 <danayo> ok thanks
2015-10-08T18:02:08 <sepidehshahi> thank you:)
2015-10-08T18:02:37 <danayo> :)
2015-10-08T18:03:08 <danayo> also, are you planning to contact everyone who gave follow-up info for interviews, or do you want to choose a subset based on the responses?
2015-10-08T18:03:14 <danayo> sepidehshahi^
2015-10-08T18:03:42 <sepidehshahi> fluid-everyone we will have the design crit in the collab room starting in a few minutes. It will be about design of the developer space
2015-10-08T18:04:27 <sepidehshahi> Based on the resources that we have, I think we will be able to only select a subset of participants from each category and contact them for interviews
2015-10-08T18:04:54 <danayo> ok sepidehshahi
2015-10-08T18:05:08 <danayo> we should discuss criteria for selection (later)
