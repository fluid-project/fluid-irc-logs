2015-07-24T20:04:03 <sepideh> danayo: I am updating several diagrams based on Nelly\xe2\x80\x99s feedback. So, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would have enough time today to do another review. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it out as soon as I finish updating the diagrams. We can continue the updates for the final version. Thanks a lot for all your help and edits :)
