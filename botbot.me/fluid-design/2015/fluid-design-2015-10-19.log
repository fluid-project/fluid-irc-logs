2015-10-19T15:47:09 <danayo> sepidehshahi, here are the posters - we decided to go with 2 side-by-side posters rather than a long banner. and we still have to confirm the name/title.
2015-10-19T15:47:11 <danayo> could you take a look at these posters and let me know if you notice anything off?

2015-10-19T18:17:03 <danayo> jessm sepidehshahi everyone: I thought this data presentation/interaction was really interesting - go to the Regions section (use buttons at top or scroll down) and hover over left (party seats) or right side (seats by region) http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/poll-tracker/2015/#regions
2015-10-19T18:18:30 <danayo> unfortunately I can't seem to use the keyboard to access the interaction

2015-10-19T19:08:03 <sepidehshahi> danayo: very interesting! thanks for sharing. Here is a link to the QI Dashboard wireframes
2015-10-19T19:08:05 <sepidehshahi> https://github.com/sepidehshahi/Quality-Infrastructure-Dashboard/blob/master/DS%20Integrated-QIDashboard.ai
2015-10-19T19:15:21 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2015-10-19T20:23:47 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I have finally started liking Github LFS:) It works pretty well for PDF files. I had some trouble with AI files. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to preview the previous version. Justin demoed how I could check out an AI file to be able to access the older versions. I think this could be handy if we use it for certain file types and keep separate branches if we are collaborating.
2015-10-19T20:32:02 <danayo> sepidehshahi: how do you mean check out a file to access older versions?
2015-10-19T20:32:35 <danayo> and why only certain file types? do you mean just the ones that can be previewed?
2015-10-19T20:35:45 <sepidehshahi> for instance, if you check out my repository, you would be able to preview both versions of the PDF file in the history. However, you would be able to only preview the lastest version of the ai file. So, I think not all file types are supported. But since we are mostly working with PDFs we should be fine
2015-10-19T20:38:42 <sepidehshahi> But Justin enetered some lines related to checking out the file in the terminal and then we were able to preview the older version of the ai file, I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what were those command lines danayo
2015-10-19T20:39:33 <danayo> so you previewed the older version in Illustrator, not in Github, right?
2015-10-19T20:39:51 <danayo> (for the ai file)
2015-10-19T20:40:08 <danayo> sepidehshahi^
2015-10-19T20:40:50 <sepidehshahi> Yes we opened it in illustrator, but the source file was in my Github repository
2015-10-19T20:41:04 <sepidehshahi> i\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a screenshot of the terminal
2015-10-19T20:47:34 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi - the problem is that we can't preview ai files at all in Github - even the current version, right?
2015-10-19T20:48:04 <sepidehshahi> that\xe2\x80\x99s right you have to save it and then open it in illustrator
2015-10-19T20:48:52 <sepidehshahi> but we normally save our ai files as PDFs, and Git supports the preview for PDFs
2015-10-19T20:49:23 <danayo> yes, we can do it that way
2015-10-19T20:56:46 <danayo> sepidehshahi: I'm thoughtful about whether/why we might need separate branches for our design repositories (rather than just storing/accessing the history, since we won't be merging our design files). But I can see why it might be helpful for cases where we're working on something at the same time. Maybe we can discuss with Justin tomorrow?

2015-10-19T20:59:12 <sepidehshahi> That\xe2\x80\x99s a really good idea. Justin_o and I discussed that a little bit today we can continue tomorrow and I\xe2\x80\x99ll ping jhung to join as well
