2015-09-08T17:33:11 <jhung> anastasiac: ping
2015-09-08T17:33:19 <anastasiac> jhung: polo
2015-09-08T17:34:37 <jhung> I was wondering if I can have your opinion on the category navigation on the ILDH anastasiac.
2015-09-08T17:34:44 <jhung> Here\'s a link.
2015-09-08T17:34:46 <anastasiac> certainly, jhung
2015-09-08T17:34:52 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-08T17:34:53 <jhung> https://jhung.github.io/docs-inclusive-learning/
2015-09-08T17:35:22 <jhung> if you load that URL, you\'ll see that the category "Introduction" is marked as active, as well as the topic on the sidebar.
2015-09-08T17:35:46 <jhung> But if you switch to "Methods" category, it\'s different.
2015-09-08T17:36:09 <jhung> If you switch to Accessible Standardized Testing category, it\'s different still!
2015-09-08T17:36:32 <anastasiac> jhung, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a huge issue, but I do see your point
2015-09-08T17:36:33 <jhung> I was wondering which of these three schemes feel like the best?
2015-09-08T17:37:28 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'d like to have something consistent even if it isn\'t the best solution. :)
2015-09-08T17:37:43 <anastasiac> I like the majority approach. I think a reasonable solution would be to find a new name for the \xe2\x80\x9cIntro\xe2\x80\x9d subsection that is listed in the left sidebar, like \xe2\x80\x9coverview\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinclusive learning\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-09-08T17:38:10 <jhung> Makes sense.
2015-09-08T17:38:22 <jhung> Duplication of navigation labels is confusing.
2015-09-08T17:38:38 <anastasiac> yes
2015-09-08T17:38:45 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m still pondering
2015-09-08T17:38:51 <anastasiac> looks fab, by the way
2015-09-08T17:39:21 <jhung> thanks anastasiac
2015-09-08T17:40:57 <anastasiac> jhung, just pondering the difference between auto-selecting the first sub-topic in the left sidebar when the link in the top navbar is activated (a la Methods) vs having nothing auto-selected by default (a la Testing)...
2015-09-08T17:41:50 <anastasiac> jhung, I think I prefer the former: always having *something* selected in the left sidebar
2015-09-08T17:42:16 <jhung> anastasiac: yes. Same here.
2015-09-08T17:42:18 <anastasiac> everything else in a section is accessible through the left sidebar
2015-09-08T17:42:23 <anastasiac> except that intro part
2015-09-08T17:42:39 <anastasiac> so you\xe2\x80\x99d need to come up with a title for those sections, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about all
2015-09-08T17:42:53 <anastasiac> Introduction, Overview...
2015-09-08T17:43:28 <jhung> anastasiac: great. Glad we\'re on the same page. I\'ll get those intro pages added / renamed where necessary.
2015-09-08T17:43:50 <anastasiac> jhung, this looks great! I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait until we can use the docs repos for all our docs!
2015-09-08T17:44:52 <jhung> yay. merging infusion-docs is going to be a whole other endeavour. I\'m not even thinking about that right now. :D
2015-09-08T17:45:40 <anastasiac> LOL
2015-09-08T17:57:18 <jhung> sepidehshahi, danayo - are you both free to chat in 5 minutes?
2015-09-08T17:57:38 <danayo> yes jhung
2015-09-08T17:57:47 <michelled> danayo: aren\'t we meeting at 2?
2015-09-08T17:57:50 <sepidehshahi> yes jhung
2015-09-08T17:58:48 <jhung> danayo: if you have another meeting, I can meet with sepidehshahi to talk about the Metadata Authoring tool.
2015-09-08T18:02:45 <danayo> oh sorry michelled, didn\'t know what time you were meeting!
2015-09-08T18:04:41 <danayo> jhung, sepidehshahi sure, what is the metadata meeting about?
2015-09-08T18:04:59 <danayo> where are you meeting michelled?
2015-09-08T18:05:03 <danayo> simonjb?
2015-09-08T18:05:11 <michelled> in my room
2015-09-08T18:05:20 <sepidehshahi> danayo: I just wanted to get some info from jhung about his design process
2015-09-08T18:05:55 <sepidehshahi> jhung: can I connect to your room?
2015-09-08T18:07:50 <jhung> sepidehshahi: sure let me unlock it

2015-09-08T20:07:18 <danayo> hi sepidehshahi, I think Jess is still going through the survey questions - how about we meet once she\'s finished?
