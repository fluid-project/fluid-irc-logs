2015-06-04T20:40:04 <danayo> anastasiac you moved the checkmarks! :)
2015-06-04T20:49:44 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: here's the latest version of the FD flow deck https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0v43syrwkdonqc/FD%20Flow.pdf?dl=0 (including sticky keys and key repeat delay screens, modified cursor speed and full keyboard control)
2015-06-04T20:51:55 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: you moved the checkmarks! :)
2015-06-04T20:52:04 <danayo> thanks murilo_crivellar - I'm taking a look through it now
2015-06-04T20:57:09 <danayo> murilo_crivellar: the wireframes look fantastic. thanks for your great work!
2015-06-04T20:57:21 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: :)
2015-06-04T20:57:58 <murilo_crivellar> danayo: but there's still some minor modifications I'll be doing tomorrow. I'll send it to you via email, is that ok?
2015-06-04T20:58:14 <danayo> perfect murilo_crivellar
2015-06-04T20:59:02 <colinclark> When we were talking a week or two ago about the idea of ASL videos and perhaps animated GIFs, I remember that the issue of frame rates came up; I think I asked if there was a minimum frame rate for being able to easily understand sign language. In case anyone is interested, I found this document that was written as part of one of Gregg's older RERC
2015-06-04T20:59:02 <colinclark> projects: http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/2010-fcc-09-47-Telecom/
2015-06-04T20:59:14 <colinclark> It talks a lot about frame rates for people who having hearing impairments

2015-06-04T21:18:27 <danayo> anastasiac, where did we leave the issue of the tab order of the tool? i can't seem to find it on the iteration page. I suspect it'll come up on monday...we had discussed having focus land on the adjuster, right?
2015-06-04T21:18:51 <anastasiac> danayo: I thought we left it at \xe2\x80\x9cthe natural order of the document\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-06-04T21:22:44 <danayo> anastasiac: I feel quite strongly that it should land on the adjuster (and my recollection is that we never really finished that discussion) - but at this late hour I don't expect us to make any changes - it will definitely be good to get feedback on it at the workshop
2015-06-04T21:23:01 <anastasiac> yes, danayo
2015-06-04T21:23:03 <danayo> it becomes especially tricky with the keyboard assessment
2015-06-04T21:23:10 <danayo> having to select the text field first
2015-06-04T21:23:12 <danayo> before typing
2015-06-04T21:23:33 <danayo> I think focus should definitely land on the text field if we're prompting users to type something
2015-06-04T21:23:53 <danayo> anyway...as I said I have a strong opinion about it! but let's get feedback :)
2015-06-04T21:36:33 <danayo> anastasiac I also just noticed that focus moves off of the + / - buttons when they are selected (so you have to tab back to them to select again) - is that a known issue? (sorry I know it's the final hour of the final hour)
2015-06-04T21:37:04 <anastasiac> s\xe2\x80\x99ok, danayo, I noticed that, too. Not sure why it\xe2\x80\x99s doing that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it did it before
2015-06-04T21:37:10 <danayo> ok
2015-06-04T21:37:13 <anastasiac> we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend tomorrow testing
2015-06-04T21:37:17 <danayo> cool
2015-06-04T21:37:17 <anastasiac> there\xe2\x80\x99s no one left here now :-)
2015-06-04T21:37:22 <danayo> I know
2015-06-04T21:37:29 <anastasiac> we can chat to see if that\xe2\x80\x99s a drastic problem
2015-06-04T21:37:33 <danayo> that's why I'm bugging you anastasiac  :)
2015-06-04T21:37:39 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, but not sure if it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple fix or not
2015-06-04T21:37:42 <danayo> right
2015-06-04T21:38:12 <danayo> yeah, I think that one would be quite surprising and annoying, but not a show-stopper for the workshop for sure
2015-06-04T21:38:51 <danayo> did I mention I think the tool is looking GREAT? :) :) :)
