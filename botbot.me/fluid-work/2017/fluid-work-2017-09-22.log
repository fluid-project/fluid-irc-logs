b'2017-09-22T14:13:50 <Bosmon> Or is it still obscure
2017-09-22T14:13:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Apparently not.
2017-09-22T14:14:03 <the-t-in-rtf> If I get back to a state where it occurs routinely, I will commit and shoot you a link.
2017-09-22T14:23:34 <the-t-in-rtf> So, with that update, all 12 of my vulnerabilities in that package are coming from gpii-handlebars.
2017-09-22T14:23:58 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, miscount, 9 variations on 3 vulnerabilities.
2017-09-22T14:24:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Only one is marked, but I\'ll clean up the others when I\'m working on that.

2017-09-22T14:38:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ve been looking into making the tests for FLUID-5534 work in the all-tests
2017-09-22T14:38:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - very good!
2017-09-22T14:38:53 <Bosmon> What conclusions have you come to?
2017-09-22T14:39:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i got this to work by adding a new test environment that just sets up the iframe
2017-09-22T14:39:11 <Justin_o> and kept the rest the same
2017-09-22T14:39:35 <Justin_o> I tried to then go back and implement this with the sequence injecting things, but am running into problems in windows. I think i\'m hitting this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1831
2017-09-22T14:39:47 <Bosmon> jhernandez - thanks so much for your wiki page!
2017-09-22T14:40:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: each set of tests will work when run separately but if i have both sets the second throws "Permission Denied" errors
2017-09-22T14:40:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I assume only in IE?
2017-09-22T14:40:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: Edge also
2017-09-22T14:41:33 <Justin_o> of course things work perfectly fine in Chrome, Firefox and Safari
2017-09-22T14:42:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - does it indeed seem to be the same as this issue? https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14535
2017-09-22T14:42:12 <Bosmon> And have we updated to the version of jQuery that it says it is fixed in?
2017-09-22T14:44:12 <Bosmon> michelled - did you see georgi\'s https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/pull/7/files ?
2017-09-22T14:44:35 <michelled> yes Bosmon, I\'ll take a look at it today
2017-09-22T14:44:53 <Bosmon> awesome!
2017-09-22T14:47:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the VM is going really slow, trying out the fiddle.. also we\'re on jQuery v3.1.0 now
2017-09-22T14:50:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the jsfiddle on that issue is passing
2017-09-22T14:50:29 <Justin_o> it could be a timing issue i guess

2017-09-22T15:59:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what has been going wrong
2017-09-22T15:59:42 <Bosmon> Something in addition to the IE selection permission problems?
2017-09-22T16:00:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: just that basically
2017-09-22T16:01:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: wonder if i can just leave it the way i had with the tests working.. or if i should keep trying to get the sequence injection way working
2017-09-22T16:03:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess another way would be to have a second iframe for the second set of tests..
2017-09-22T16:03:23 <Justin_o> that should work

2017-09-22T11:55:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Was there a reason that was removed, or did someone just miss a step?
2017-09-22T11:58:57 <the-t-in-rtf> It basically breaks all of my windows tests locally and in CI.

2017-09-22T13:08:56 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I am updating a package where I use kettle.test.pushInstrumentedErrors, it doesn\'t appear to be trapping the error any longer.
2017-09-22T13:09:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anything changed there?
2017-09-22T13:09:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s the bit I\'m updating: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-json-schema/blob/master/tests/js/server/parser-update-failure-tests.js
2017-09-22T13:10:07 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - it shouldn\'t have done
2017-09-22T13:10:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I did nothing but pull in a newer Kettle, and now the expected explosion is not container.
2017-09-22T13:10:15 <Bosmon> It still exists and is used in Kettle\'s own tests
2017-09-22T13:10:25 <the-t-in-rtf> s/container/contained/
2017-09-22T13:11:19 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - your code is, of course, a near carbon copy of that which is in Kettle\'s "ErrorTests.js"
2017-09-22T13:11:41 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I believe that was written on advice from a Doctor
2017-09-22T13:12:54 <Bosmon> I\'ve heard that you can effectively use Apples
2017-09-22T13:12:58 <Bosmon> If you want to keep those away
2017-09-22T13:13:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Until you built Rachael\'s machine, I would have considered that fairly accurate.
2017-09-22T13:13:46 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2017-09-22T13:13:56 <Bosmon> Well I just bought that one on Ebay
2017-09-22T13:13:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I\'m updating to the version of Infusion Kettle 1.7.0 uses to see if that makes any difference.
2017-09-22T13:14:03 <Bosmon> I do tend to keep away from it : P
2017-09-22T13:14:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Nope, the error still gets through to Error.fluid.fluidError
2017-09-22T13:15:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I was on 1.6.4 previously, I\'ll drill back from 1.7.0 to see if I see anything.
2017-09-22T13:15:38 <Bosmon> Ah, have you updated your node-jqUnit to match?
2017-09-22T13:15:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe so.
2017-09-22T13:16:01 <Bosmon> Not that I believe the changes there are significant either
2017-09-22T13:16:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I just use  "npm outdated"
2017-09-22T13:16:31 <Bosmon> The only thing I can recall that has changed in this area is that infusion now has its own inbuilt default uncaught error handler
2017-09-22T13:16:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Speaking of which, why is 1.7.0 not listed as a release here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/releases
2017-09-22T13:16:54 <Bosmon> But this is a very minor change since it just gets overridden immediately you include any of the other projects
2017-09-22T13:16:56 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s going to make it a bit harder to investigate.
2017-09-22T13:17:47 <Bosmon> Thanks for spotting this missing tag, now added
2017-09-22T13:18:27 <the-t-in-rtf> great.
2017-09-22T13:19:10 <Bosmon> To debug your issue, set a breakpoint here and see what listeners you see:
2017-09-22T13:19:11 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/module/fluid.js#L101
2017-09-22T13:19:11 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-22T13:19:41 <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanks.
2017-09-22T13:27:29 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-22T13:29:12 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-09-22T13:29:44 <the-t-in-rtf> the listener is in fact the first in the array of "fail" listeners.
2017-09-22T13:31:18 <the-t-in-rtf> although, oddly, it\'s an object rather than a function.
2017-09-22T13:39:18 * michelled has quit
2017-09-22T13:44:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Although kettle also passes the function name as a string in its tests.
2017-09-22T13:46:27 <the-t-in-rtf> If I pass the function rather than the string, it still fails in the same way.
2017-09-22T13:57:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m reverting the version updates and trying them singly to see if I can find some odd interaction.
2017-09-22T14:00:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-22T14:02:24 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I\'ve made all the non-trivial updates except for the holy trinity of kettle, node-jqUnit, and infusion
2017-09-22T14:02:33 <the-t-in-rtf> The test still passes
2017-09-22T14:03:49 * lliskovoi has quit

2017-09-22T14:06:49 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-09-22T14:07:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I wonder what the symptoms of the failure are exactly?
2017-09-22T14:08:07 <Bosmon> If the listener is there as expected, perhaps something a bit more subtle is happening
2017-09-22T14:08:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, the only change I need to make to fix it is to downgrade
2017-09-22T14:08:59 <Bosmon> wow
2017-09-22T14:09:54 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m trying just the infusion update now.
2017-09-22T14:10:01 <the-t-in-rtf> fine.
2017-09-22T14:10:18 <the-t-in-rtf> (I upgrade to the infusion tag that kettle 1.7.0 and node-jqUnit 1.1.7 use)
2017-09-22T14:10:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Upgrading kettle
2017-09-22T14:10:48 <the-t-in-rtf> fine
2017-09-22T14:12:01 <Bosmon> !
2017-09-22T14:12:07 <Bosmon> So you only get the failure if you update all three?
2017-09-22T14:12:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, this is getting very odd.
2017-09-22T14:12:31 <the-t-in-rtf> In fact I no longer get the error if I upgrade them each in sequence.  Blowing away my node_modules entirely.
2017-09-22T14:12:43 <the-t-in-rtf> That is bizarre beyond words
2017-09-22T14:12:47 <the-t-in-rtf> it works
2017-09-22T14:12:48 <Bosmon> I see
2017-09-22T14:12:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I have done nothing.
2017-09-22T14:12:56 <the-t-in-rtf> But downgrade and upgrade individually.
2017-09-22T14:12:59 <Bosmon> Have you already made all the corresponding updates in gpii-express and gpii-handlebars?
2017-09-22T14:13:29 <the-t-in-rtf> no, but I confirmed that the top-level versions were loading.
2017-09-22T14:13:37 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-09-22T14:13:45 <Bosmon> So can you give me some reproduction steps?
