b'2017-05-23T16:37:46 <colinclark> I think it would be just fine to rename and redescribe and repurpose that one :)
2017-05-23T16:37:50 <colinclark> since Cloud4All is long since over
2017-05-23T16:37:56 <colinclark> and this matches as closely as anything I know of
2017-05-23T16:38:10 <Justin_o> also there is "web applications support" which sounds like it\'s more for web apps as opposed to extensions, but it also contained a couple JIRAs for the extension, which i\'ve cross linked to the chrome extension component i mentioned above
2017-05-23T16:38:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks.. what do you think of "web personalization browser extension" or just "UIO+"
2017-05-23T16:38:59 <colinclark> either sounds fine to me
2017-05-23T16:39:05 <colinclark> the former is probably more descriptive
2017-05-23T16:39:15 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-05-23T16:39:18 <Justin_o> i\'ll go with that

2017-05-23T16:55:34 <gtirloni> Justin_o: amatas
2017-05-23T16:55:41 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2017-05-23T16:56:50 <amatas> hi Justin_o
2017-05-23T16:56:53 <Justin_o> amatas: for me it seems that I can\'t edit external links on gpii.wiki.net using the wysiwyg editor. I believe this is because that change requires a captcha, which is only presented when editing source
2017-05-23T16:59:01 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-05-23T16:59:03 <amatas> sorry Justin_o, I don\'t use to edit in the wiki, what do you mean with editing external links?
2017-05-23T17:01:49 <Justin_o> amatas: i mean, if you add an external link, link to a page outside of the gpii wiki, it will throw an"Unknown error". in a "Something went wrong" dialog. But if i switch to "Edit Source" I\'m able to add the link, but need to respond to a captcha
2017-05-23T17:02:15 <amatas> ok, let me check
2017-05-23T17:02:34 <Justin_o> amatas: thanks
2017-05-23T17:06:01 <amatas> Justin_o: I added an external link at the bottom of this page https://wiki.gpii.net/w/AT_Settings , and I didn\'t get that error. :/
2017-05-23T17:06:21 <amatas> what username do you have at the wiki?
2017-05-23T17:08:54 <gtirloni> Justin_o: anything on the browser\'s console?
2017-05-23T17:09:02 <gtirloni> it works for me here too
2017-05-23T17:09:13 <gtirloni> chrome 58
2017-05-23T17:18:53 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2017-05-23T17:21:56 <Justin_o> gtirloni, amatas: i was using safari, so could be related to that
2017-05-23T17:21:59 <Justin_o> let me try again
2017-05-23T17:25:18 <Justin_o> gtirloni, amatas: Chrome and safari both don\'t work for me. my user name is Jobara
2017-05-23T17:25:30 <Justin_o> also i get this error in the console on page load
2017-05-23T17:25:31 <Justin_o> [a4f342e5dd7b5ba46d9eb2e7] 2017-05-23 17:24:21: Fatal exception of type "BadMethodCallException"

2017-05-23T17:26:20 <gtirloni> got the same here but it works for me
2017-05-23T17:26:21 <Justin_o> but again that\'s on page load, so not sure it is related to editing or not
2017-05-23T17:27:07 * avtar has quit
2017-05-23T17:28:02 <amatas> perhaps could be related to the permissions of the user?
2017-05-23T17:30:53 <amatas> I\'m looking for how to give admin permissions to jobara

2017-05-23T17:40:43 <amatas> wat?
2017-05-23T17:40:49 <amatas> :D
2017-05-23T17:40:53 <Justin_o> amatas: seems that my permission is set to Bureaucrats
2017-05-23T17:40:58 <Justin_o> not sure what that means
2017-05-23T17:41:04 <gtirloni> amatas: yes
2017-05-23T17:42:21 <amatas> I don\'t know why I get a Permission error if I am an administrator
2017-05-23T17:42:59 * kasparnet has quit
2017-05-23T17:43:01 <amatas> gtirloni: can you add permissions to users?
2017-05-23T17:43:26 <gtirloni> yep, just made Jobara an administrator
2017-05-23T17:43:40 <gtirloni> and added \'bureaucrat\' to you alfredo
2017-05-23T17:43:42 <amatas> thanks, could you add me as a bureaucrats
2017-05-23T17:43:48 <amatas> cool, thanks
2017-05-23T17:44:09 <amatas> now it works for me
2017-05-23T17:44:11 <amatas> weird
2017-05-23T17:44:47 <amatas> Justin_o: could you check if now you get the same error?
2017-05-23T17:47:48 <Justin_o> amatas, gtirloni: no more errors.. thanks for the help
2017-05-23T17:48:04 <amatas> yw
2017-05-23T17:50:11 <gtirloni> making you an admin fixed it?

2017-05-23T17:59:11 <Justin_o> gtirloni: seems to have
2017-05-23T17:59:46 <gtirloni> that super weird
2017-05-23T18:01:06 <Justin_o> gtirloni: if it was related to the captcha could be that i don\'t need to fill one out now.. or something like that.. i didn\'t try the source editing though so not sure
2017-05-23T18:02:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni: just tried the source editing, i don\'t need a captcha there anymore, so i think this all had to do with that
2017-05-23T18:02:17 <gtirloni> got it, makes sense

2017-05-23T20:38:46 <simonjb> colinclark: I think it\'s good, I like the part at the end about not being teacher-student

2017-05-23T20:39:28 <colinclark> do you think there\'s an overview of our MyL3 work that might helpful also as background information?
2017-05-23T20:40:00 <colinclark> There\'s this, which danayo prepared recently: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIqIgJ3H7R_sj7ybrUYq-QZj0Zs-kU3wjUa_rNrHVZM/edit
2017-05-23T20:40:16 <colinclark> but I don\'t know if it\'s too much background information/distracting/intimidating
2017-05-23T20:41:34 <simonjb> colinclark: that doc looks great but it\'s quite long
2017-05-23T20:43:24 <colinclark> it is indeed

2017-05-23T12:51:08 <simonjb> I think the second one should be "Option 3"
2017-05-23T12:51:22 <cindyli> good finding, simonjb, fixing...

2017-05-23T13:00:37 <cindyli1> colinclark: the one right now
2017-05-23T13:00:41 <colinclark> ok
2017-05-23T13:01:03 <colinclark> I wonder what the other one is, looks like Sandra sent it?
2017-05-23T13:01:13 <cindyli1> Bosmon, colinclark, simonjb, stegru: ready to meet? in my video room
2017-05-23T13:01:28 <stegru> oh!
2017-05-23T13:02:04 <stegru> my calandar says it\'s in 1 hour? but i\'m ready anyway
2017-05-23T13:04:23 <cindyli> Bosmon: r u there?
2017-05-23T13:08:09 <cindyli> stegru: do you have trouble accessing my vidyo room
2017-05-23T13:08:30 <stegru> cindyli: sandra has made a calendar request for goto meeting in 1 hour, but didn\'t invite you
2017-05-23T13:08:44 <stegru> yes, can\'t install the client (doing it in a vm)

2017-05-23T13:14:32 <cindyli> Bosmon, stegru: since you guys having trouble connecting to my vidyo room, colinclark, simonjb and i think it\'s probably good to do it at 10 like what\'s showed on the calendar
2017-05-23T13:15:37 <cindyli> Bosmon, stegru: the link to my vidyo room - https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/flex.html?roomdirect.html&key=OsoXQ9RZH5

2017-05-23T14:27:49 <Justin_o> jhung: are they wanting UIO to change the language on the page, or to change the language of UIO themselves?
2017-05-23T14:28:48 <jhung> Change the language of UIO itself Justin_o.
2017-05-23T14:30:20 <Justin_o> jhung: they\'d need to add new message bundles
2017-05-23T14:31:59 <Justin_o> jhung: and then set the relevant locale
2017-05-23T14:32:51 <Justin_o> jhung: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L68
2017-05-23T14:32:57 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure that\'s exposed by the plugin though
2017-05-23T14:33:47 <jhung> Is there an easy way to do this or some documentation that can be written on it? I imagine it\'s a fairly common thing to do (even if just to customize strings) Justin_o
2017-05-23T14:35:15 <Justin_o> jhung: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/LocalizationInThePreferencesFramework.html#specifying-a-localization
2017-05-23T14:36:08 <Justin_o> jhung: i can\'t quite remember but i don\'t think the plugin exposed many of the options, it\'s something that we wanted to do though
2017-05-23T14:36:23 <Justin_o> but potentially there\'s no direct way to set the locale with the plugin
2017-05-23T14:38:35 <Justin_o> jhung: judging by this https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/blob/master/admin-options.php it seems that it\'s just a couple of selectors that can be specified
2017-05-23T14:39:55 <jhung> Justin_o: hmmm. okay. So the only way to do this would be to use UIO directly without the plugin.
2017-05-23T14:43:25 <Justin_o> jhung: there might be away to change the injected markup in the plugin
2017-05-23T14:44:25 <Justin_o> jhung: if there\'s a way to modify this https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/blob/master/uio.js#L31 they could make the change there too
2017-05-23T14:44:29 <Justin_o> but i\'m not sure if there is or not
2017-05-23T14:47:43 <jhung> so technically they can add a new terms item in line 35 which points to an accessible local directory Justin_o?
2017-05-23T14:47:57 <Justin_o> jhung: no
2017-05-23T14:48:38 <Justin_o> jhung: they\'d either need to set a new defaultLocale option
2017-05-23T14:49:38 <Justin_o> or change the locale option
2017-05-23T14:50:01 <Justin_o> or add a locale preference in the settings
2017-05-23T14:50:09 <jhung> so basically it\'s not easy unless they\'re comfortable with editing the files of the plugin.\\
2017-05-23T14:50:31 <Justin_o> pretty much
2017-05-23T14:51:04 <jhung> ok thanks Justin_o.
2017-05-23T14:53:13 <Justin_o> jhung: if you have time, could you please file or update an open JIRA to specific which options should be exposed, or if all of them, how to best expose them in the admin interface
2017-05-23T14:53:44 <jhung> colinclark: I was looking at Margaret\'s email re internationalization of the UIO plugin for WP. Based on the discussion w Justin_o above, it doesn\'t sound easy. How should we follow up? Is this something that can be done through Bodies in Translation?
2017-05-23T14:54:28 <colinclark> Hasn\'t this already been done on some sites? Localizing UIO to several different languages, I mean?
2017-05-23T14:54:52 <jhung> colinclark: not with the Wordpress plugin to my knowledge.
2017-05-23T14:55:13 <colinclark> ok
2017-05-23T14:55:31 <colinclark> I don\'t think we can fund this through BiT, but we can definitely do so through FLOE
2017-05-23T14:55:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: the only one that i can think of is first discovery tool, but that had different language for the preferences
2017-05-23T14:55:52 <colinclark> and it seems like an entirely worthwhile thing to make easier for our users
2017-05-23T14:56:19 <colinclark> I was pretty sure that one of the sites Carla and Eva put together had translated versions of UIO, but I can\'t remember
2017-05-23T14:56:30 <colinclark> anyway\xe2\x80\x94it sounds like this is very much worth doing
2017-05-23T14:57:04 <jhung> ok. I\'ll file a jira for this and hope we get around to it. I\'ll ask Margaret what her timeline is so we get a better idea what their needs are.
2017-05-23T14:57:29 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-05-23T14:57:33 <jhung> Justin_o: I think if we can somehow leverage WP\'s built-in internationalization, that would be best. Not sure how that will work.
2017-05-23T14:57:39 <Justin_o> maybe we can do the update when we update the plugin to work with the responsive uio
2017-05-23T14:57:54 <jhung> ok sounds good Justin_o.
2017-05-23T14:57:56 <Justin_o> jhung: that seems to make sense
2017-05-23T14:58:08 <colinclark> jhung: yeah, that makes a lot of sense

2017-05-23T15:05:44 <gloob> stegru: about the bug, I want to trace it down, didn\'t find the time yet
2017-05-23T15:06:13 <gloob> stegru: it\'s related with one of the commands for the start menu set

2017-05-23T15:07:05 <gloob> stegru: last time I checked it it was WEIRD but it was also after a week of sprinting doing the demo, so a PIBKC is probable
2017-05-23T15:07:14 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: is there an IDRC planning meeting today?
2017-05-23T15:07:55 <gloob> stegru: I will keep you posted to let you blame on me

2017-05-23T15:09:34 <colinclark> hi Justin_o, regarding the planning meeting, it\'s really up to us
2017-05-23T15:10:04 <cindyli> stegru: what does that mean? some chinese?
2017-05-23T15:10:05 <colinclark> I asked michelled about it before she went on vacation and she said that she thought everyone\'s priorities were pretty clear, but if anyone wanted to have the planning meeting we should
2017-05-23T15:10:54 <danayo> how about just a regular standup meeting today Justin_o, colinclark, fluid-everyone ?
2017-05-23T15:11:01 <colinclark> sounds good to me
2017-05-23T15:11:05 <jhung> danayo: sounds fine to me.
2017-05-23T15:11:16 <Justin_o> danayo, colinclark: sounds good thanks

2017-05-23T16:36:55 <colinclark> ok
2017-05-23T16:37:15 <Justin_o> I see that there is a "Google Chrome Implementation" component but just noticed that it\'s description says "Cloud4all SP3: Google Chrome Plugin" is that specific to a C4A deliverable, or can i repurpose it
