2017-09-21T15:53:08 <gmoss> In case anyone is interested, I\'ve learned that the Android client for Vidyo is a big drain on the battery, though it works just fine.

2017-09-21T16:31:32 <jhernandez> in fact, this complex process is very well illustrated in this script https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/hst-2017/provisioning/Installer.ps1

2017-09-21T18:44:54 <jhernandez> well, I did some tests by running it manually, and at some point it worked
2017-09-21T18:46:05 <stegru> we must have been smoking something good... i re-compiled the same file using the same VM, but it didn\'t work today

2017-09-21T18:49:45 <stegru> all, i think - let me check
2017-09-21T18:50:38 <stegru> yes jhernandez
2017-09-21T18:51:10 <jhernandez> okay
2017-09-21T18:53:36 <jhernandez> stegru: I do know that you already tested the new metrics with amatas, but do you want me to test anything else there?
2017-09-21T18:54:24 <stegru> i\'ll write up a test plan for tomorrow, if you like
2017-09-21T18:55:15 <jhernandez> okay, that would be great since I\'m not sure what exactly needs to be tested/checked

2017-09-21T19:19:49 <dins> A Statistical Approach to Recommend Musical Harmony by Sampling (Planning on doing using deep neural networks)
2017-09-21T19:19:52 <dins> Music is a very broad language. Pretty much everyone enjoying music and composing music, no matter how knowledgeable in music they are. But, after composing a melody, adding harmony parts and arrangements is one of the practical problem many people fall into since that requires some kind of a knowledge and experience in music. Even though there are many solutions addressing the same problem,...
2017-09-21T19:19:53 <dins> ...the ability given to the user to define the style of an expected harmony is very limited. However, the expected input is a music style that is in the mind which is hard to express either in words or actions to a computational system. That might be possible to express as a music arrangement, which might be another composition. For an example, a user might need to get generated a harmony...
2017-09-21T19:19:54 <dins> ...part per the style of a part in a Bach\xe2\x80\x99s composition which can be given as an input sample. And then by learning the style of input samples in an efficient way, harmony recommendations can be predicted to the source melody which is the study mainly focused in this research. This approach introduces a way to generate a harmony according to the style defined by input samples which is...
2017-09-21T19:19:56 <dins> ...accessible even to anyone who has no much music knowledge.

2017-09-21T13:43:14 <stegru> i think it could be possible to automate it, amatas - a cron job that exports then upload/email it
2017-09-21T13:43:42 <stegru> but then we\'ll lose our jobs to computers :(

2017-09-21T13:47:45 <grrrero> Justin_o: michelled and I wanted to ask if FLUID-6186 and FLUID-6187 are needed for UIO+
2017-09-21T13:48:52 <Justin_o> grrrero: no, not for the time being anyways.
2017-09-21T13:49:17 <grrrero> Justin_o: Ok cool

2017-09-21T14:02:25 <clown> jhernandez, Bosmon, stegru, hi \xe2\x80\x94 just to let you know, I\'m working on that windows processes bridge bug.
2017-09-21T14:02:29 <clown> Thanks for all the info.
2017-09-21T14:02:38 <Bosmon> clown - awesome, thanks!
2017-09-21T14:03:04 <colinclark> kasparnet, Bosmon: Are you interested in resuming our conversation from yesterday, shortly?
2017-09-21T14:03:04 <clown> now whether I can fix it\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-09-21T14:03:15 <kasparnet> yes
2017-09-21T14:03:48 <Bosmon> clown - it might be better to just leave this issue to any clients
2017-09-21T14:04:05 <Bosmon> One could argue that parsing command line strings doesn\'t fall within the responsibility of the process reporter
2017-09-21T14:04:27 <Bosmon> On the other hand, if it is not possible to determine the executable name without this, then .....
2017-09-21T14:04:49 <clown> well, that\'s a simple solution \xe2\x80\x94 just annihilate makeargv.
2017-09-21T14:05:18 <clown> Sure, I will try to fix, and see how it goes.
2017-09-21T14:05:26 <clown> Is there a windows meeting today?

2017-09-21T14:09:04 <Bosmon> clown - not planned, no
2017-09-21T14:10:00 <Bosmon> clown - you could also just throw this over the fence to an existing npm module on the JS side
2017-09-21T14:10:13 <Bosmon> Which would spare you the onerous task of writing adequate tests
2017-09-21T14:10:16 <Bosmon> Assuming the module had any : P

2017-09-21T14:11:34 <clown> another good idea Bosmon,  need to look for one
2017-09-21T14:11:44 <clown> thanks stegru

2017-09-21T14:12:52 <Bosmon> clown - https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-argv perhaps
2017-09-21T14:13:02 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-21T14:13:53 <stegru> but in Windows, it\'s up to the process how it handles argv (that\'s just how the c-runtime does it). It\'s just a blob of data
2017-09-21T14:13:59 <Bosmon> Look clown, it has more than zero tests!
2017-09-21T14:14:00 <Bosmon> https://github.com/mccormicka/string-argv/blob/master/test/Index.spec.js
2017-09-21T14:14:20 <Bosmon> But yes, if we can get the executable name out easily without this, I recommend doing nothing at all
2017-09-21T14:14:51 * clown sorry on phne
2017-09-21T14:15:02 <Bosmon> stegru - but I believe the "string to argv algorithm" is indeed specified, right?
2017-09-21T14:15:09 <Bosmon> WHich is all, if anything we should be doing
2017-09-21T14:15:44 <stegru> yes
2017-09-21T14:16:32 <stegru> I imagine that\'s how node does it (indirectly, via argv in C)
2017-09-21T14:17:52 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-21T14:17:54 <stegru> could always create a C program, invoke it with the arguments, then print argv line-by-line ;

2017-09-21T15:17:11 <stegru> yes, i can install filebeat
2017-09-21T15:17:51 <amatas> I need some error data at ES
