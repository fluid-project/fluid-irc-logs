2017-12-22T03:35:28 <chlorophilia> perfect analogy to get people thinking.

2017-12-22T09:44:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyone out there used fluid.pushArray in their work?
2017-12-22T09:44:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> I want to know if it\'s possible to operate directly on the holder.
2017-12-22T09:45:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> i.e. its signature is fluid.pushArray(holder, member, newContent);
2017-12-22T09:45:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> I want to be able to pass "" or something like it to indicate that we are operating directly on holder.
2017-12-22T09:46:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean "" for the "member" location.
2017-12-22T09:46:12 <the-t-in-rtf1> which doesn\'t work.
2017-12-22T09:46:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> @Bosmon or anyone who\'s actually working?
2017-12-22T09:47:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can do it by wrapping an existing array in a throwaway object, but was hoping there was a cleaner way.
2017-12-22T09:47:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> var myArray = [];
2017-12-22T09:47:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> fluid.pushArray({ array: myArray}, "array", [0,1,2]); // myArray now holds [0,1,2]
2017-12-22T09:50:54 <the-t-in-rtf1> I guess it\'s a pretty thin wrapper around array.push.apply, I may just go that route.
2017-12-22T09:51:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> I liked that it also applied fluid.makeArray to the value.
2017-12-22T09:53:17 <the-t-in-rtf1> If it\'s worth doing, seems like if we converted these to use fluid.get, the normal "" convention would work: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/Fluid.js#L463
