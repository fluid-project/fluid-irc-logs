2017-10-19T17:01:52 <kasparnet> goddammit, I did the classic of leaving you after the ping
2017-10-19T17:01:58 <kasparnet> Bosmon,
2017-10-19T17:02:18 <kasparnet> I\'ll try and ping you in the morning, perhaps
2017-10-19T17:06:24 <Justin_o> kasparnet: sorry, didn\'t mean to distract him
2017-10-19T17:07:42 <kasparnet> haha, no not at all, this was very much my own fault.... I have a tendency of "ping drivebys", pinging him and then being distracted
2017-10-19T17:07:51 <kasparnet> only to ping him back 30-120 minutes later
2017-10-19T17:07:58 <kasparnet> when he\'s busy with something else
2017-10-19T17:09:02 <Justin_o> we\'re all always trying to ping him :)

2017-10-19T19:24:30 <stegru> virtualbox 5.2 has worked for me for a day so far
2017-10-19T19:28:59 <clown> gtirloni:  FYI, I tried the new universal VM,  the one with the 9.90GB hard drive
2017-10-19T19:29:23 <gtirloni> that\'s the old one
2017-10-19T19:29:30 <clown> after running the node and browser tests, it was up to 90% full.
2017-10-19T19:29:36 <gtirloni> the new one has a 15GiB disk
2017-10-19T19:29:44 <gtirloni> let me check
2017-10-19T19:29:58 <clown> But after running the production tests, it is 90% full, and I\'m getting message from the OS saying \xe2\x80\xa6
2017-10-19T19:30:18 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6 only 190 MB left
2017-10-19T19:30:30 <clown> okay, maybe I got the wrong machine; I\'ll check too
2017-10-19T19:30:41 <gtirloni> please see if you have 20171019 as the box version
2017-10-19T19:31:15 <clown> This one:  "inclusivedesign/fedora26                (virtualbox, 20171019)"
2017-10-19T19:31:31 <clown> yup, the numbers match yours, gtirloni
2017-10-19T19:32:05 <gtirloni> ok, thanks for testing it.. i\'ll check what might be wrong
2017-10-19T19:32:09 <clown> I\'m getting the disk size from looking at the VM settings itself.
2017-10-19T19:34:08 <gtirloni> did you `vagrant destroy` you VM and recreated it after you update the base box?
2017-10-19T19:34:12 <clown> The VM storage settings for the "fedora26-v20171019-disk001.vmdk" report an virtual size of 9.90GB
2017-10-19T19:34:51 <clown> Yes,  the sequence was:  1. vagrant destroy, 2. vagrant box update, 3. vagrant box prune, 4. vagrant up.
2017-10-19T19:35:21 <clown> actually 1. vagrant destroy -f
2017-10-19T19:35:49 <gtirloni> cool, ok i can reproduce.. they CI jobs may have started to work just because this box happened to be 100-200MB smaller (due to updates, etc).. so i didn\'t check it too carefully
2017-10-19T19:37:18 <clown> I noticed that running the production tests involves a whole lot of installing.  I\'ll see if I still have the information in some log file.
2017-10-19T19:38:19 <gtirloni> yes, it creates the Docker image (so runs `npm install` inside it)
2017-10-19T19:38:36 <gtirloni> we\'re in a hybrid situation.. half VM / half container
2017-10-19T19:38:59 <clown> ah okay.
2017-10-19T19:39:03 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-10-19T19:40:42 <gtirloni> oh this is sweet.. the disk_size option is set in the builder\'s configuration AND in a Makefile...
2017-10-19T19:40:46 <gtirloni> there we go
2017-10-19T19:41:05 <clown> are they the same?
2017-10-19T19:42:31 <clown> my guess:  no, and the smaller size option is overwriting the larger one.  ?
2017-10-19T19:43:21 <gtirloni> yep, exactly :) why it\'s set in a Makefile... we forked a famous project and it seems that specific line came with it. I\'ll fix that and release a new box (in 30-45min)
2017-10-19T19:45:09 <clown> cool!  thanks gtirloni.
2017-10-19T19:45:29 <grrrero> avtar: Do you know where we can see what the Hacktoberfest shirt looks like?
2017-10-19T19:45:37 <clown> I\'ll see what I can do with it then, although it will be close to the end of day.

2017-10-19T10:47:38 <kasparnet> heya yuriy
2017-10-19T10:48:04 <yuriy> hi, kasparnet
2017-10-19T10:48:18 <kasparnet> would you happen to have an example of a message sent from the PSP to the GPII core, when a preference has been changed?
2017-10-19T10:48:54 <kasparnet> (as in, I change a setting in the PSP, it then sends the payload X)
2017-10-19T10:50:08 <yuriy> let me ping georgitodorov on this, he is the one that can be of more help here
2017-10-19T10:50:22 <kasparnet> cheers yuriy
2017-10-19T10:53:51 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: Here is what the PSP sends to the GPII core when the magnification preference is changed to the value of 3: {"path":["settingControls","http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/magnification"],"type":"ADD","value":3}
2017-10-19T10:55:12 <kasparnet> awesome! Thanks georgitodorov
2017-10-19T11:01:05 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hi, Antranig! Is it okay if we postpone our meeting with 30 minutes?
2017-10-19T11:10:02 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov - sure

2017-10-19T11:37:10 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: We are ready now. Shall we call you?
2017-10-19T11:38:33 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - sure
2017-10-19T11:46:37 <kasparnet> Bosmon: in the gpii.pcpChannel.sessionBinder component of PCPChannel.js
2017-10-19T11:47:13 <kasparnet> I take it htat the relay would go from the session to the PCP automatically whenever the relevant places of the session changes
2017-10-19T11:47:22 <kasparnet> but I fail to find where the source is actually set up
2017-10-19T11:50:59 <Bosmon> kasparnet - do you mean here?
2017-10-19T11:51:01 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/13a8f45683f88c6cf5ae6ff68f3eee8dff5cbc05/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L206
2017-10-19T11:51:38 <Bosmon> kasparnet - this is where incoming changes from the socket are relayed onto our local model
2017-10-19T11:51:51 <Bosmon> Or do you mean in the other direction
2017-10-19T11:52:28 <Bosmon> Coming from the LM model to our local model the relay is here: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/13a8f45683f88c6cf5ae6ff68f3eee8dff5cbc05/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L18
2017-10-19T11:53:38 <kasparnet> yeah, the second part is the one that I dont quite follow
2017-10-19T11:53:44 <kasparnet> when is that triggered?
2017-10-19T11:53:55 <kasparnet> I figured it\'d be model changes of the session
2017-10-19T11:54:15 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, it is
2017-10-19T11:54:19 <kasparnet> but I cant see any place where it\'s hooked up to the session
2017-10-19T11:54:42 <Bosmon> kasparnet - that options distribution does it
2017-10-19T11:55:22 <Bosmon> Here: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/13a8f45683f88c6cf5ae6ff68f3eee8dff5cbc05/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L52
2017-10-19T11:55:44 <kasparnet> ahh, ofc, I see
2017-10-19T11:55:57 <kasparnet> I was confused by the source statement of line 13-15
2017-10-19T11:56:18 <kasparnet> but ofc, it\'ll use the model of the component
2017-10-19T11:56:27 <kasparnet> and source is just the path into the model
2017-10-19T11:56:56 <kasparnet> cheers, Bosmon

2017-10-19T15:11:59 <gmoss> Hi all, I got a late start to the day and I may not make it in time for standup. If not, yesterday I worked on the storytelling tool to get categories to display properly in the storyViewer. Simon helped me discover the solution, and then I worked further on the tool. The community meeting was great, I think we gave them valuable feedback on their app. Today I plan to work on the ST some more, probably looking into
2017-10-19T15:11:59 <gmoss> an issue with a model relay that we want to prevent from triggering another relay in the same component.
2017-10-19T15:13:03 <gmoss> (currently on the subway)
2017-10-19T15:15:19 <Justin_o> gmoss: if you haven\'t already, you may want to look at the "source" argument of a request and "excludeSource" and "includeSource" options of a modelRealy

2017-10-19T15:18:43 <gmoss> Justin_o: Alan and I did try to fiddle with the source args, but we may have misunderstood the exact usage. I\'ll review the docs and see if there\'s any new meaning I can get from them :) Do think you would have time today to take a look at the code with me?
2017-10-19T15:19:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, you\'re right - I guess this does imply a certain kind of "never-resolving promise" in order to work properly
2017-10-19T15:20:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: assume that would truncate/prune some request chains
2017-10-19T15:20:58 <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, i should have some time
2017-10-19T15:22:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the other option i was exploring, albeit messy, is to debounce the get/set request itself but there\'s a bunch of wrapping and other stuff that will make it less fun to work with i think
2017-10-19T15:24:20 <ussjoin> Hello, world.
2017-10-19T15:25:36 <Justin_o> hello
2017-10-19T15:26:25 <gmoss> Justin_o: thanks, that\'s much appreciated :)

2017-10-19T16:19:03 <Justin_o> grrrero: i left a couple comments on the FLOE-508 PR https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/pull/5
2017-10-19T16:22:27 <Justin_o> gmoss: let me know when you\'d like to pair up. I should be available any time now
2017-10-19T16:22:50 <gmoss> Justin_o: I\'m good any time as well, thanks! say 12:30?
2017-10-19T16:23:07 <Justin_o> gmoss: sure sounds good
2017-10-19T16:23:49 <kasparnet> Bosmon, are you still around?
2017-10-19T16:27:28 <Bosmon> Hi kasparnet
2017-10-19T16:28:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you\'ve finished talking to kasparnet, if you still have time, I\'d like to talk over strategies for debouncing the datasource
2017-10-19T16:33:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - unfortunately I need to head out now for the afternoon ....
2017-10-19T16:34:06 <Bosmon> But based on what you observed earlier I am starting to wonder whether this might not be best implemented another way
2017-10-19T16:34:28 <Bosmon> Since continuing in this direction appears to require extending our promise API which seems a bit too fundamental an engineering point to be looking at for now
2017-10-19T16:34:39 <Bosmon> Well, maybe not
2017-10-19T16:35:12 <Bosmon> Well, maybe so.... sorry to be so vague about this, especially given in theory it is something we have spent years thinking about
2017-10-19T16:35:25 <Bosmon> But as our numerous attempts show, it is a remarkably hard thing to get right
2017-10-19T16:36:24 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure how we would communicate to our promise sequence algorithm that one member of the chain had fully handled the request, without something like https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5790
2017-10-19T16:36:38 * colinclark has quit
2017-10-19T16:36:50 <Bosmon> I mean, we could say that a blocked promise has been "cancelled"
2017-10-19T16:36:57 <Bosmon> Which is then a separate resolution to being rejected
2017-10-19T16:38:04 <Bosmon> But this still doesn\'t explain why the promise chain algorithm overall then considers that the overall request has in fact been handled, at some later date
2017-10-19T16:38:17 <Bosmon> Let\'s keep thinking in the meantime until we can get together again
