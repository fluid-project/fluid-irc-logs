2017-11-03T14:58:05 <dandimitrov> Hi, Bosmon, we\'re are experiencing strange behaviour with the electron tests (run by `npm test` command) - all tests pass, but the process doesn\'t finish... Could you share some ideas on where this hanging might be coming from
2017-11-03T14:58:36 <dandimitrov> You can test this behaviour here: (https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/bug/timeout)
2017-11-03T15:04:05 * colinclark has quit
2017-11-03T15:04:21 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-11-03T15:08:38 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - not sure, let\'s ask stegru and michelled too
2017-11-03T15:08:48 <Bosmon> Have you found that the process exits dodgily in the past?
2017-11-03T15:09:17 <stegru> probably
2017-11-03T15:09:22 <michelled> Bosmon: do you remember before you helped me refactor the tests it used to exit oddly? and kasper had that extra exit in there?
2017-11-03T15:09:33 <dandimitrov> ^No, with the version that is in `gpii-app` master it finishes normally
2017-11-03T15:11:17 * colinclark has quit
2017-11-03T15:11:20 <Bosmon> Yes, I remember
2017-11-03T15:11:35 <Bosmon> The overall process exit should be timed by that jqUnit callback, onAllTestsDone
2017-11-03T15:12:44 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-11-03T15:13:48 <stegru> an extra exit? what did he do.. put another "process.exit()" after another, incase the first one didn\'t work? ;)
2017-11-03T15:13:54 <Bosmon> stegru - hahaha
2017-11-03T15:14:33 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, stegru, michelled: If that may be of any help, it hangs only with the `dev.testDefs` tests suite (we tried running them separately)
2017-11-03T15:15:11 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - you should find that exit is triggered via this route: https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqunit/blob/master/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L192
2017-11-03T15:20:08 * kavya joined the channel
2017-11-03T15:20:30 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - do you see the "All tests concluded" banner line?
2017-11-03T15:20:30 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, it seems it is being called
2017-11-03T15:20:47 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - ok, well that\'s pretty interesting
2017-11-03T15:20:56 <Bosmon> I wonder if something can prevent process.exit functioning in some cases
2017-11-03T15:21:04 <dandimitrov> and it is really strange that a second `process.exit` really does the job...
2017-11-03T15:21:10 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - argh!
2017-11-03T15:21:13 <dandimitrov> :D
2017-11-03T15:22:22 <stegru> haha!
2017-11-03T15:22:37 <stegru> while (true) { process.exit(); }
2017-11-03T15:22:50 <Bosmon> That\'s utter nonsense
2017-11-03T15:25:05 <Bosmon> All I can find is this so far, which doesn\'t look strongly relevant: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10156
2017-11-03T15:25:44 <stegru> there are quite a few redefinitions of process.exit in the depths of node_modules - i wonder if something has redefined it
2017-11-03T15:26:36 * yuriy joined the channel
2017-11-03T15:27:57 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame that debugging under electron is so hard
2017-11-03T15:28:26 <Bosmon> The standard node-inspector doesn\'t work, and there is a slightly shoddy electron-inspector which generally doesn\'t seem to go for me
2017-11-03T15:28:38 <Bosmon> Also, we should see why dandimitrov has failed to update our electron to the latest

2017-11-03T16:29:41 <jhernandez> Bosmon: wrt updating electron, the last stable version of electron is based on node 7.x series, which is not LTS
2017-11-03T16:30:00 <Bosmon> jhernandez - ah, I understand
2017-11-03T16:30:01 <jhernandez> and IIRC, we decided to stick on LTS releases
2017-11-03T16:30:08 <Bosmon> Ok, very good
2017-11-03T16:30:37 <Bosmon> But are we up to date with the last stable electron that is on 6.x?
2017-11-03T16:30:43 <jhernandez> right
2017-11-03T16:31:13 <jhernandez> in any case, let me check
2017-11-03T16:33:22 <jhernandez> right, electron 1.4.1 uses node 6.5.0
2017-11-03T16:34:12 * Jess_ has quit
2017-11-03T16:34:50 <jhernandez> let me check the other electron 1.4.x series, but IIRC, they switched very fast to use node 7.x series
2017-11-03T16:37:05 <gtirloni> we\'re running containers with node 8.x now, found this for electron: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9970
2017-11-03T16:41:27 <jhernandez> gtirloni: interesting, in what containers are we using node 8? in the docker containers where flowmanager/prefs server are deployed?
2017-11-03T16:41:45 <gtirloni> yes
2017-11-03T16:41:58 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/Dockerfile
2017-11-03T16:42:35 <jhernandez> okay, I didn\'t know that electron already started moving to 8.x series
2017-11-03T16:45:32 <jhernandez> FYI, electron moved from node 6.x to 7.x as of electron 1.5.1
2017-11-03T16:46:39 <jhernandez> and there are still a few updates for electron 1.4.x series, the last one is 1.4.16
2017-11-03T16:47:21 <jhernandez> the last stable version of electron uses node 7.x series, so we don\'t have a stable release of electron that uses node 8.x yet
