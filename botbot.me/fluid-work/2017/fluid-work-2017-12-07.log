2017-12-07T14:16:10 <stegru> jhernandez: what\'s the branch you where using for the cursor problem?
2017-12-07T14:16:26 <jhernandez> I\'ve just created a last one, which is the one I talked about yesterday, the issue when using "elaine"
2017-12-07T14:16:39 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/577
2017-12-07T14:17:19 <jhernandez> kasparnet_, Bosmon: let me know if you want this to go into master now
2017-12-07T14:17:42 <jhernandez> if not, I should mention that issue when delivering the installer
2017-12-07T14:19:25 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'m using ASTEA\'s PCP-client branch of gpii-app, and my "psp-061217" branch of both windows and universal

2017-12-07T14:20:42 <jhernandez> the psp-061217 branch of windows just points to universal\'s psp-061217, which includes all the pull requests we talked about yesterday
2017-12-07T14:21:17 <jhernandez> the list of them is on my "troubeshooting" document, under "Changes for the next installer"
2017-12-07T14:24:21 <kasparnet_> jhernandez, the pull you referenced with elaine
2017-12-07T14:24:34 <kasparnet_> doesn\'t it work if there is no "configure" directive?
2017-12-07T14:24:59 <kasparnet_> and if so, perhaps an empty "configure" directive would be more clear
2017-12-07T14:27:58 <jhernandez> kasparnet_: oh, I see
2017-12-07T14:28:26 <jhernandez> as far as I remember, this is how I could get it working after a few attempts
2017-12-07T14:28:35 <jhernandez> but I can try that
2017-12-07T14:29:27 <kasparnet_> well, it might actually need that content

2017-12-07T11:09:14 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru and @Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/131#issuecomment-349936357
2017-12-07T11:10:14 <the-t-in-rtf> I figured out at least how to get to the state where tests cannot be rerun.  Previously I was mainly working with one or the other suite of tests, and didn\'t realise that one was affecting the other rather than a previous run of the same suite causing problems.
2017-12-07T11:10:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll comment on the pull with error messages shortly.
2017-12-07T11:10:57 <stegru> ok
2017-12-07T11:12:46 <stegru> just seen your coverage report, the-t-in-rtf - interesting how the registryResolver has the least coverage, and I\'m currently looking into a potential bug in it
2017-12-07T11:13:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, coverage reports are good for mapping mine fields of untested assumptions.
2017-12-07T11:14:05 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s one reason I like them so much.
2017-12-07T11:14:25 <the-t-in-rtf> There will always be things that are too expensive to test, but in general if you see whole fields of untested code, it\'s a red flag.
2017-12-07T11:14:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Sometimes it\'s as simple as missing out a test in a rollup script that calls other tests.
2017-12-07T11:14:44 <stegru> also, in WindowsUtilities, there are no tests (at all), it still has good coverage :)
2017-12-07T11:14:46 <the-t-in-rtf> We found a lot of those in other reviews.
2017-12-07T11:15:05 <the-t-in-rtf> well, it\'s hit in using other things, then.
2017-12-07T11:15:16 <stegru> yes
2017-12-07T11:15:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the coverage report doesn\'t suggest that you explicitly tested everything, only that you\'ve reached particular parts of the code during a test run.
2017-12-07T11:15:58 <stegru> oh it\'s good the way it highlights the un-ran code
2017-12-07T11:16:56 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I figured out why they haven\'t merged my line number pull, the old istanbul repo is deprecated in favor of their new monorepo.
2017-12-07T11:17:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll put in a pull against that, hopefully they are more active there.
2017-12-07T11:17:39 <the-t-in-rtf> (I have a pull open against nyc\'s predecessor that makes the line numbers into placeholder links)
2017-12-07T11:17:49 <stegru> the error you pasted in the PR.. are you getting that repeatedly?
2017-12-07T11:18:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I get it consistently as soon as I\'ve run the acceptance tests in a particular shell.
2017-12-07T11:18:24 <the-t-in-rtf> And I do run refreshenv between test runs.
2017-12-07T11:18:53 <the-t-in-rtf> If either of you have looked at the root of the report, refresh that.
2017-12-07T11:19:09 <the-t-in-rtf> A previous version didn\'t exclude Gruntfile.js and gpii.js from the report.
2017-12-07T11:19:17 <the-t-in-rtf> that slightly improved our overall numbers.
2017-12-07T11:19:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me know if there are other things that should excluded.
2017-12-07T11:40:14 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-12-07T11:50:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I already plan to exclude the tests within the packages, fixing that now.
2017-12-07T11:56:49 <stegru> so let me get this straight, the-t-in-rtf.. you run unit + acceptance tests (they pass), when you run the acceptance tests the 2nd time they fail?
2017-12-07T11:56:59 <the-t-in-rtf> no
2017-12-07T11:57:07 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s the acceptance tests that break the unit tests.
2017-12-07T11:57:12 <stegru> ok
2017-12-07T11:57:17 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if I run them first even then the unit tests won\'t pass.
2017-12-07T11:57:21 * amatas joined the channel
2017-12-07T11:57:46 <stegru> ok.. unit->acceptance works, but acceptance->unit doesn\'t?
2017-12-07T11:57:54 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s right.
2017-12-07T11:58:07 <the-t-in-rtf> but only once.
2017-12-07T12:02:09 <stegru> and only in the same shell?
2017-12-07T12:15:59 * kasparnet_ has quit
2017-12-07T12:19:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.
2017-12-07T12:19:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Still haven\'t seen the mouse errors you were reporting.
2017-12-07T12:20:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I managed to exclude the test content, which is harder than it should be.  That\'s the good news.
2017-12-07T12:20:38 <the-t-in-rtf> The bad news is that including the test coverage was the only thing that made our coverage look decent.
2017-12-07T12:20:57 <the-t-in-rtf> well, I mean, the parts that need work stand out a lot more clearly now.
2017-12-07T12:20:58 <the-t-in-rtf> http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/coverage-reports/windows/20171207/index.html
2017-12-07T12:22:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Actually, that looks wrong.
2017-12-07T12:23:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I can clearly see that stuff that\'s hit isn\'t.  I think excluding the test content is going to be problematic.
2017-12-07T12:23:42 <the-t-in-rtf> isn\'t reported as being hit, I mean.
2017-12-07T12:29:44 <stegru> I can\'t reproduce your "same shell" problem (provisioning a new VM now..)
2017-12-07T12:30:47 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, are you starting a new shell via the start menu? because opening up the menu actually fixes the GPII-2001 error that you had
2017-12-07T12:31:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I am.
2017-12-07T12:31:45 <the-t-in-rtf> and it doesn\'t for me at least in the latest Windows 10 VM.
2017-12-07T12:31:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Speaking of which, the start menu is super sluggish in the VM.
2017-12-07T12:32:24 <stegru> what about re-running the tests in the same shell, but opening a new shell (and don\'t use it) when you\'re about to run the failing test?
2017-12-07T12:33:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I can try that in a minute, already closed my previous shell in preparation for a new test run.
2017-12-07T12:33:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Short, day, BTW, I have to leave shortly for an appointment.
2017-12-07T12:33:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Tomorrow is a full day, I\'ll keep chugging.
2017-12-07T12:34:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I think I just got a complete report without test content, confirming shortly.
2017-12-07T12:34:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I had allowed nyc to clean out before its run, which meant only the last suite was included.
2017-12-07T12:34:50 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-12-07T12:34:55 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, yeah.  Much better.
2017-12-07T12:34:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Uploading now.
2017-12-07T12:36:47 <the-t-in-rtf> http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/coverage-reports/windows/20171207/index.html
2017-12-07T12:36:59 <the-t-in-rtf> That looks pretty good (nice coverage) and accurate.
2017-12-07T12:38:15 <the-t-in-rtf> rerunning after opening a new shell now.
2017-12-07T12:38:23 <stegru> that\'s better.. less noise
2017-12-07T12:38:36 <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, I want people to be able to actually use the thing.
2017-12-07T12:38:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Your instincts were spot expletive on.
2017-12-07T12:39:07 <the-t-in-rtf> opening a new shell allows the previous shell to run the tests again.
2017-12-07T12:39:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Any idea why?
2017-12-07T12:39:31 <stegru> yes..
2017-12-07T12:39:50 <stegru> there\'s a process that goes to sleep, and that blocks one of the SPI calls
2017-12-07T12:40:04 <stegru> opening up the start menu and typing something wakes that process up
2017-12-07T12:40:18 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s irritating.
2017-12-07T12:40:21 <the-t-in-rtf> our fault, or windows\'
2017-12-07T12:40:21 <the-t-in-rtf> ?
2017-12-07T12:40:48 <stegru> I think windows.. I submitted a bug report

2017-12-07T12:41:32 <stegru> i was running around in circles like you, too - i thought it only worked in powershell, but it was the act of starting powershell that fixed it
2017-12-07T12:44:48 <the-t-in-rtf> wow, great find.
2017-12-07T12:45:09 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, off I go, at least the pull is in good shape.
2017-12-07T12:45:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Have a great day.
2017-12-07T12:46:55 <stegru> and you
2017-12-07T12:52:51 <stegru> are you alive yet, jhernandez ?

2017-12-07T13:26:53 <jhernandez> stegru: I am
2017-12-07T13:27:07 <jhernandez> I\'ve been out this morning
2017-12-07T13:27:28 <stegru> that\'s ok
2017-12-07T13:27:36 <jhernandez> sup?
2017-12-07T13:27:53 <stegru> so, I\'m looking at this problem you had last night
2017-12-07T13:28:06 <jhernandez> yes
2017-12-07T13:28:13 <jhernandez> and?
2017-12-07T13:28:17 <jhernandez> can you reproduce it?
2017-12-07T13:28:19 <stegru> and I can\'t reproduce it
2017-12-07T13:29:33 <jhernandez> :/
2017-12-07T13:29:49 <stegru> could you have a look in the registry, HKLM/Control Panel/Cursors?
2017-12-07T13:30:03 <stegru> so I can see if it\'s reading or writing that\'s bad
2017-12-07T13:30:24 <jhernandez> sure, let me grab my mac
2017-12-07T13:30:36 <stegru> no rush
2017-12-07T13:31:42 <stegru> "No": "\xed\x8d\xb8\xe0\xab\xa3\xed\x97\xa0\xe0\xab\xa3\xee\xbf\xb5\xef\xa2\xad\xe7\x94\x80\xe8\xb0\x80\xea\xbb\x90\xe0\xab\xac", - I think that\'s chinese for "it\'s broken"
2017-12-07T13:39:01 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'d say it\'s elf language, but that there\'s no character map to represent the letters
2017-12-07T13:39:04 <jhernandez> xDDD
2017-12-07T13:39:25 <stegru> yes
2017-12-07T13:39:35 <jhernandez> I can\'t see any elf right now in the registry
2017-12-07T13:39:47 <jhernandez> let me see if I can make it happen again
2017-12-07T13:39:50 <stegru> ok thanks
2017-12-07T13:39:59 <jhernandez> it\'s not something that I can reproduce all the time
2017-12-07T13:40:03 <jhernandez> :/
2017-12-07T13:40:04 <stegru> oh right
2017-12-07T13:40:29 <stegru> but it\'s happened more than once, right?
2017-12-07T13:41:01 <jhernandez> yup
2017-12-07T13:41:26 <jhernandez> first time I saw it was in Gregg\'s machine, during a test session
2017-12-07T13:42:16 <jhernandez> and yesterday night I finally could see it happenning here
2017-12-07T13:42:39 <jhernandez> I guess it\'s a matter of hitting the carpet harder
