b'2017-07-13T18:04:30 <cindyli> sorry, Bosmon, just saw ur msg. trying that test
2017-07-13T18:04:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - don\'t worry about it
2017-07-13T18:04:52 <Bosmon> There is just something deeply screwed up with my desktop machine
2017-07-13T18:04:52 <cindyli> u\'ve figured out?
2017-07-13T18:04:55 <Bosmon> No
2017-07-13T18:04:57 <cindyli> cool
2017-07-13T18:05:04 <Bosmon> But I tried running it on my laptop and it is fine
2017-07-13T18:05:16 <cindyli> that\'s good
2017-07-13T18:05:17 <Bosmon> For some reason pouchdb will no longer operate under Chrome on my desktop
2017-07-13T18:05:36 <Bosmon> It just hangs on any operation
2017-07-13T18:06:01 <cindyli> wonder if there\'s a browser setting for using local storage. checking..
2017-07-13T18:08:32 <cindyli> pouchdb common errors - https://pouchdb.com/errors.html
2017-07-13T18:08:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s started failing on my laptop too now :(
2017-07-13T18:09:05 <cindyli> nooooo
2017-07-13T18:09:18 <cindyli> just hangs, no error?
2017-07-13T18:10:12 <Bosmon> Just hangs
2017-07-13T18:10:30 <cindyli> only with chrome, what about firefox
2017-07-13T18:10:36 <Bosmon> firefox is fine
2017-07-13T18:10:49 <Bosmon> But unfortunately testem can never find my firefox installations
2017-07-13T18:10:51 <Bosmon> For some reason
2017-07-13T18:12:19 <cindyli> wonder if this issue is related - https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/3415
2017-07-13T18:12:36 <cindyli> see the last comment
2017-07-13T18:12:43 <cindyli> i tried clicking "clear site data" in dev tools "application" tab with Indexed DB checked, closing the TAB, reopening the tab, and that fixed it.
2017-07-13T18:12:57 <cindyli> the work around
2017-07-13T18:13:05 <Bosmon> Yes, I read this issue earlier
2017-07-13T18:13:11 <cindyli> ok
2017-07-13T18:13:18 <Bosmon> There is actually no site data under that tab
2017-07-13T18:13:54 <cindyli> trying on my machine
2017-07-13T18:14:38 * pratik_r joined the channel
2017-07-13T18:16:17 <cindyli> ok here
2017-07-13T18:16:33 <Bosmon> Ok, I did find the "Clear Data" button
2017-07-13T18:16:35 <Bosmon> But it did nothing
2017-07-13T18:17:45 <Bosmon> What\'s odd is that I have the identical version of Chrome on my laptop as on the desktop
2017-07-13T18:17:49 <Bosmon> And it has not updated itself
2017-07-13T18:18:00 <Bosmon> But in the course of this afternoon it has become as hosed as my desktop
2017-07-13T18:18:13 <Bosmon> There must somehow be some bad Chrome update

2017-07-13T18:40:06 <Bosmon> Also perhaps you can try it out under CPU load

2017-07-13T10:43:10 <amatas> all points to a windows unexpected behavior or bug, and they suggest some workarounds

2017-07-13T10:56:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, they seem to be suggesting possible workarounds, I don\'t see that they actually agreed to try one.
2017-07-13T10:56:54 <the-t-in-rtf> You mean the FileNotFoundCacheLifetime option?
2017-07-13T10:56:54 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2230#issuecomment-4387926
2017-07-13T10:57:43 <Bosmon> jhernandez - you say "and green" meaning it all works ok?
2017-07-13T10:58:08 <jhernandez> Bosmon: right
2017-07-13T10:58:11 <jhernandez> ALL GREEN
2017-07-13T10:58:18 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s good
2017-07-13T10:58:29 <Bosmon> I guess we need to make some attempt to understand the problem in order to report to resolve
2017-07-13T10:58:41 <Bosmon> We don\'t want to be maintaining this fork forever
2017-07-13T10:59:07 <jhernandez> right
2017-07-13T11:00:30 <jhernandez> I\'ll do some debugging and try to spot what\'s the problem
2017-07-13T11:00:58 * stegru joined the channel
2017-07-13T11:01:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, I confirmed that npm@5 is not an option at all, testing the one workaround I spotted in the thread you sent as soon as npm@3 finishes installing.
2017-07-13T11:02:20 <amatas> ok
2017-07-13T11:29:13 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, the FileNotFoundCacheLifetime workaround doesn\'t appear to help, I see the same kettle resolve failure when running the gpii-pouchdb tests from c:/vagrant, but not from v:/
2017-07-13T11:29:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Were there others in that thread you thought might be worth trying?
2017-07-13T11:31:18 * jhung has quit
2017-07-13T11:34:17 <amatas> ok, good to know, thanks for your tests
2017-07-13T11:35:28 <amatas> I only see two possible workarounds, the FileNotFoundCacheLifetime option and the creation of an addtional drive mapped to the UNC source
2017-07-13T11:40:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I know the latter works\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2017-07-13T11:40:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, still bummed about npm@5, but it\'s good to keep testing.
2017-07-13T11:42:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I tried yarn as well along the way, it\'s still busted for particular libraries as well.

2017-07-13T14:47:54 <javjarfer> stegru, mmm you mean for the start menu customization?
2017-07-13T14:48:03 <stegru> yes, that\'s right
2017-07-13T14:50:20 <javjarfer> stegru, just a second, searching the code for you
2017-07-13T14:50:39 <stegru> just tell me roughly where it is, javjarfer - i can search

2017-07-13T15:04:42 <stegru> that\'s ok
2017-07-13T15:05:02 <javjarfer> the simplification is handled by the script .ahk
2017-07-13T15:05:28 <javjarfer> and the xml spec is in the file StartMenuLayout.xml
2017-07-13T15:07:27 <stegru> ah, thanks
2017-07-13T15:07:44 <stegru> auto hot key?
2017-07-13T15:07:58 <javjarfer> yes, that is
2017-07-13T15:08:21 <javjarfer> was the first time we tried it, gloob is the one that knows more about
2017-07-13T15:08:48 <javjarfer> but it has really cool features
2017-07-13T15:09:42 <stegru> yeh I\'ve used it a few times
2017-07-13T15:10:31 <stegru> oh, i was hoping you\'d be creating a custom xml file, rather than a fixed one
2017-07-13T15:12:18 <javjarfer> stegru, yep, that would have been cooler, and a better example for sure xD
2017-07-13T15:12:38 <stegru> it\'s ok, i can wait while you make me one ;)

2017-07-13T15:39:15 <gloob> you can use Windows!
2017-07-13T15:39:34 <stegru> yes, but i don\'t care about the start menu
2017-07-13T15:39:49 <gloob> stegru: what are you looking for then?
2017-07-13T15:39:55 <gloob> a visual menu?
2017-07-13T15:40:31 <stegru> with changing the language, it can be done in a similar way - where you pass an xml file to a command
2017-07-13T15:41:28 <stegru> i thought if you guys had done something smart with xml, then i wouldn\'t have to do it ;)

2017-07-13T16:53:56 <Bosmon> jhernandez - absolutely brilliant!
2017-07-13T16:54:06 <jhernandez> https://github.com/substack/node-resolve/blob/master/lib/node-modules-paths.js#L34
2017-07-13T16:55:04 <jhernandez> so, resulting dirs come as "\\vboxsrv\\vagrant"
2017-07-13T16:55:32 <jhernandez> when in theory they should be "\\\\vbox\\vagrant"
2017-07-13T16:56:38 <jhernandez> which is coming from the result of path.join here (https://github.com/substack/node-resolve/blob/master/lib/node-modules-paths.js#L30)
2017-07-13T16:59:55 <jhernandez> to me, path.join is behaving well and I guess that probably it\'s resolve\'s implementation that should be considering this use case
2017-07-13T17:00:06 <jhernandez> just guessing
