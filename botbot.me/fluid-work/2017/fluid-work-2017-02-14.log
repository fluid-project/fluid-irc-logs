2017-02-14T15:06:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o, alanharnum, javjarfer - I was thinking that March 8th looks free for our "Fantastic Infusion and Where to Find it" meeting
2017-02-14T15:06:45 <Bosmon> Although I know that colinclark will be away in Stutgart that day
2017-02-14T15:07:02 <alanharnum> Bosmon: what is that, exactly? I think I might have missed this conversation.
2017-02-14T15:07:10 <Bosmon> We could also do March 22nd, or else make some kind of fixture in a different slot
2017-02-14T15:07:17 <Bosmon> Sorry alanharnum, I was just starting to bring it up :)
2017-02-14T15:07:45 <Bosmon> So javjarfer is a splendid new member of the GPII team, and was keen to have a kind of "Infusion-fest" for getting to know things and concepts
2017-02-14T15:08:00 <alanharnum> ah cool
2017-02-14T15:08:04 <Bosmon> And I was speculating that working through your new tutorial might be an interesting "spine" to hang such a meeting on
2017-02-14T15:08:23 <alanharnum> yeah I think that would be a great test run
2017-02-14T15:08:32 <alanharnum> and gives me a deadline to complete revisions on it by :p
2017-02-14T15:11:09 <javjarfer> Bosmon, haha thanks you! It  would be really nice, for me March 8th, or 22nd looks totally fine

2017-02-14T16:06:49 <Justin_o> either of those dates would work

2017-02-14T16:14:11 <Justin_o> alanharnum: do you have a preference for March 8 or 22?
2017-02-14T16:17:49 <alanharnum> Justin_o: nope, either of those seems fine by me
2017-02-14T16:19:13 <Bosmon> colinclark - any chance you\'d be able/willing to attend from your STUTTGART EVENING?
2017-02-14T16:25:04 <javjarfer> Justin_o, thanks you! Really happy to join
2017-02-14T16:25:13 <Justin_o> :)
2017-02-14T16:30:27 <colinclark> Bosmon: I think I could arrange it, yes
2017-02-14T16:31:53 <Bosmon> Wow, brilliant

2017-02-14T16:36:39 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2017-02-14T16:39:22 <Bosmon> Thanks so much for the Infusion merge, cindyli1!
2017-02-14T16:39:35 <Bosmon> simonjb - Do you think you might have time to look at this bite-sized Kettle pull? https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/30
2017-02-14T16:40:25 <Bosmon> javjarfer - I guess alanharn_ and Justin_o have the final say, but if it is scheduled, you will see it appear here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops
2017-02-14T16:40:35 <Bosmon> There is one of these every week and some of the others may be of interest too
2017-02-14T16:40:54 <simonjb> yes, sorry Bosmon I know it\'s been sitting for a while -- I can do it this week
2017-02-14T16:41:06 <Bosmon> simonjb - oh, no worries - cheers!
2017-02-14T16:42:01 <Bosmon> simonjb - I managed to get my "visible nexus" demo working last night btw, so I guess we should starting talking at some point how we can integrate this with your co-occurrence demo
2017-02-14T16:42:19 <simonjb> Bosmon: awesome!
2017-02-14T16:43:09 <javjarfer> Bosmon, oh nice! Sure they are, I will take a look
2017-02-14T16:44:26 <Bosmon> As a general headsup to everyone I\'ve just rolled 3.0.0-dev.20170214T161720Z.6126724 of Infusion which incorporates the Infusion fixes which cindyli has been pushing through over the last week
2017-02-14T16:44:41 <Bosmon> These arose from bugs I found during the "fluid-authoring" work for "visible nexus"

2017-02-14T19:13:05 <cindyli> i have no idea of how to re-produce the problem. do you have a chance to look into it
2017-02-14T19:13:37 <cindyli> looks like the file name "gpii.preferencesServer.config.production" is hardcoded somewhere
2017-02-14T19:14:13 <cindyli> not in "ansible-preferences-server" repo. i\'ve searchr
