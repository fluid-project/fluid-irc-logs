b'2017-09-12T17:40:15 <Bosmon> The URL it was at was here: https://fluidproject.org/blog/2008/07/21/about-this-and-that/
2017-09-12T17:40:36 <Bosmon> gtirloni - any history or notions about the fate of our ancestral blog?
2017-09-12T17:43:43 <gtirloni> Bosmon: looks like the blog/ dir is missing an index.html (that\'s why there\'s a 403 error)... and then the files in there are named different. I\'d have to defer to jhung on this one
2017-09-12T17:44:01 <gtirloni> https://fluidproject.org/blog/2008-07-21-about-this-and-that.html
2017-09-12T17:45:30 <jhung> gtirloni, Bosmon: Hmmm. I\'d have to look.
2017-09-12T17:48:39 <Bosmon> Oh great, thanks
2017-09-12T17:48:41 <Bosmon> It still exists
2017-09-12T17:49:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o, grrrero - note that not all of the thinking in this blog entry is still current
2017-09-12T17:49:27 <Bosmon> It would be quite a surprise if after 10 years it was :)
2017-09-12T17:50:18 <jhung> Bosmon: it looks like there\'s no good way of getting to the old blog content unless you knew the URL. I can\'t seem to find an internal link from the project site to the blog.
2017-09-12T17:51:08 <jhung> I think it was done that way to preserve any old links. At the time I think there was a consensus to deal with the blog "later".
2017-09-12T17:51:28 <Bosmon> jhung - well, it doesn\'t seem as if it did indeed preserve any old links : P
2017-09-12T17:51:53 <Bosmon> For example the one on this docs page: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/DeclarativeThisismInIoC.html
2017-09-12T17:52:51 <jhung> Bosmon. That\'s a pretty 404 page.
2017-09-12T17:54:09 <jhung> So two issues: 1. We should get the docpad redirect plugin installed so any links to old bog articles will continue to work. 2 We should also decide how to internally link to the blog on the fluid project site.
2017-09-12T18:07:43 <alanharnum> Bosmon Justin_o: I\'ve never seen this post before, it\'s super-interesting (though I understand the thinking has no doubt changed in 10 years...)
2017-09-12T18:07:52 <alanharnum> gmoss, you may be interested - https://fluidproject.org/blog/2008-07-21-about-this-and-that.html
2017-09-12T18:08:27 <Bosmon> We no longer take seriously the criticism of "prototype hijacking"
2017-09-12T18:08:27 <alanharnum> particularly since when we pair you see me make the "write {this} instead of {that} for an IoC reference" mistake repeatedly
2017-09-12T18:08:44 <Bosmon> Given at the time we failed to understand that JavaScript was primarily based on SmallTalk, not LISP
2017-09-12T18:09:08 <Bosmon> Today we would say just the opposite, that the facilities of so-called "prototype hijacking" simply don\'t go far enough
2017-09-12T18:09:26 <gmoss> cool, thanks alanharnum! I\'ll give both pages a read
2017-09-12T18:09:26 <Bosmon> We also no longer take seriously the arguments about security
2017-09-12T18:10:00 <alanharnum> Bosmon: yeah, I totally understand your thinking has evolved on certain areas - that said, it is super-interesting to understand the historical lineage of certain decisions
2017-09-12T18:10:01 <Bosmon> In fact, quite the reverse, we would want to expose even more primitives of the system publically, rather than less
2017-09-12T18:10:53 <Bosmon> However, the section on "The object-oriented features that C has to offer" is not only immortal, it is even premature : P
2017-09-12T18:11:09 <alanharnum> I think a line like "Particularly, the aim is to cater to requirements of more structured programming, by larger, looser teams sharing components over longer timescales" is helpful in understanding Infusion philosophically
2017-09-12T18:11:38 <Bosmon> Yes, the line is correct
2017-09-12T18:11:57 <Bosmon> Although in practice many of the things we have done in the name of it have actually damaged this aim rather than supported it : P
2017-09-12T18:12:03 <Bosmon> Still, it is our lodestar
2017-09-12T18:12:44 <Bosmon> Going back to the point about C, just these months my pal KELLES published this astonishing pre-print which I recommend to anyone who has time: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~srk31/research/papers/kell17some-preprint.pdf
2017-09-12T18:12:55 <Bosmon> "SOME WERE MEANT FOR C"
2017-09-12T18:13:17 <Bosmon> Eventually some future variant of Infusion, we believe, will be implemented in this kind of C
2017-09-12T18:13:44 <alanharnum> when I was first talking to gmoss to Infusion, I think one of the things I said was "if you think of the framework as doing various things to guide you towards writing distributed, decoupled code, it becomes easier to reason about", which I think (at least for me) is true
2017-09-12T18:13:51 <alanharnum> ENTERPRISE-GRADE INFUSION
2017-09-12T18:14:01 <Bosmon> Yes, right, that one
2017-09-12T18:14:11 <Bosmon> It is coming
2017-09-12T18:14:37 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I\'ll just leave this here: https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran
2017-09-12T18:15:21 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes, that project is also highly topical
2017-09-12T18:15:42 <Bosmon> Since my pal Luke was reminding me over lunch at GOGOL today that the inventor of LISP strongly pressed for it to be implemented as a FORTRAN library
2017-09-12T18:15:51 <Bosmon> Otherwise, he felt, it would get no adoption : P
2017-09-12T18:21:35 <Bosmon> Incredible stuff: https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/blob/master/src/json_value_module.F90#L3863

2017-09-12T11:44:07 <georgitodorov> Hi everyone! In the basic widget set document for the PCP I can see that there is a "Number from a Range (integer or continuous)" widget which appears to be a combination between a TextfieldSlider and a TextfieldStepper component. Shall we actually combine these components or can we simply use a slider (or a stepper aternatively)?

I\'m struggling with the following problem: I have dynamic components (inside a viewComponent) which should be created with the different values from a sources list, but `{source}` expression appears to be the same (the first item of the sources list) across all dynamic components?

2017-09-12T15:27:16 <jhernandez> did you go far with the .exe.exe thing? / are you planning to keep investigating into it?

2017-09-12T15:28:51 <stegru> no
2017-09-12T15:29:01 <jhernandez> I remember seeing this in a previous pull request from you
2017-09-12T15:29:02 <clown_mtg> jhernandez:  yes, I\'m working on a fix. I\'ll do a pull request later today.
2017-09-12T15:29:07 <stegru> I mean, yes.. i think I\'ve sorted it

2017-09-12T15:39:19 <jhernandez> stegru: well, I run the tests and they stop right after receiving that message, and the results from testing locally are consistent with that
2017-09-12T15:40:01 <stegru> this is the first failure:
