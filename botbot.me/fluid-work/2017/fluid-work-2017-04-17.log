2017-04-17T13:26:35 <Justin_o_> cindyli: good morning
2017-04-17T13:26:44 <cindyli> good morning, Justin_o_
2017-04-17T13:27:02 <cindyli> isn\'t u on vacation?
2017-04-17T13:27:07 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i have some time right now, so i can work on any PR comments you have for FLUID-5532
2017-04-17T13:27:30 <Justin_o_> cindyli: yes, but i have some time to kill at the moment, so might as well use it to finish up some work ;)
2017-04-17T13:27:41 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o_. having a look
2017-04-17T13:29:01 <Justin_o_> cindyli: also I tracked down the issue for the panel opening too much on iOS. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6151?focusedCommentId=36720&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-36720
2017-04-17T13:29:23 <Justin_o_> basically it has to do with the OpenSans font.. i think it\'s a bit delayed in being applied to the injected form element
2017-04-17T13:31:20 <cindyli> great finding, Justin_o_. so the panel opens fine without the OpenSans font? umm\xe2\x80\xa6 is there a work around
2017-04-17T13:31:46 <Justin_o_> cindyli: we don\'t use the font for mobile, that would be one option
2017-04-17T13:31:59 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-04-17T13:33:02 <cindyli> Justin_o_: is it a must-required for the desktop?
2017-04-17T13:34:35 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i don\'t know, i guess so, it\'s part of the design
2017-04-17T13:34:48 <Justin_o_> cindyli: we\'d probably need to talk to dana about it
2017-04-17T13:35:05 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i\'m also not sure if there are any other work aorunds
2017-04-17T13:35:33 <cindyli> i see. thanks, Justin_o_

2017-04-17T14:12:11 <Justin_o_> cindyli: I made some changes to the PR based on your review comments
2017-04-17T14:12:16 <Justin_o_> cindyli: and also left some replies
2017-04-17T14:13:09 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o_. do you think it makes sense to add ur reply as a code comment?
2017-04-17T14:13:30 <cindyli> about the "above" and "below" divs
2017-04-17T14:15:19 <Justin_o_> cindyli: there are comments to indicate which is for which, mobile vs desktop
2017-04-17T14:15:53 <Justin_o_> cindyli: did you want more information about tab order too?
2017-04-17T14:16:37 <cindyli> Justin_o_: yes, and buttons show above the prefs editor for the mobile version and shows below for the destop version
2017-04-17T14:16:50 <Justin_o_> okay
2017-04-17T14:17:05 <cindyli> i was wondering why the selectors were named as "above" and "below" instead of "mobile" and "desktop", Justin_o_
2017-04-17T14:17:38 <Justin_o_> cindyli: hmm..
2017-04-17T14:17:51 <Justin_o_> cindyli: maybe smallScreen and wideScreen?
2017-04-17T14:17:55 <Justin_o_> what do you think
2017-04-17T14:18:49 <cindyli> i think it\'s ok to name as "above" and "below" as long as they are explained in the code comment
2017-04-17T14:19:42 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i\'m thinking about this some more.. maybe their position doesn\'t matter, they just show up where they are
2017-04-17T14:19:56 <Justin_o_> and it is more important to indicate when they are used
2017-04-17T14:20:24 <Justin_o_> cindyli: so maybe fl-panelBar-smallScreen fl-panelBar-wideScreen
2017-04-17T14:20:29 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o_
2017-04-17T14:20:49 <Justin_o_> or fl-panelBar-full fl-panelBar-tab
2017-04-17T14:21:21 <Justin_o_> cindyli: do you have a preference for which set/
2017-04-17T14:21:22 <Justin_o_> ?
2017-04-17T14:21:32 <Justin_o_> cindyli: also is it still important to mention tab order?
2017-04-17T14:22:30 <Justin_o_> cindyli: we might even be able to just have one extra class name
2017-04-17T14:22:31 <cindyli> Justin_o_: i prefer the former: fl-panelBar-smallScreen fl-panelBar-wideScreen, or fl-panelBar-mobile, fl-panelBar-desktop
2017-04-17T14:22:50 <Justin_o_> cindyli: so we might be able to just have fl-panelBar-wideScreen
2017-04-17T14:22:55 <Justin_o_> and not need the smallScreen one
2017-04-17T14:23:01 <cindyli> also think it\'s important to mention the tab order cuz that\'s why we need 2 identical divs
2017-04-17T14:23:42 <cindyli> Justin_o_: personally i would prefer to have the smallScreen one to establish the association
2017-04-17T14:24:11 <Justin_o_> oay
2017-04-17T14:24:13 <Justin_o_> okay
2017-04-17T14:34:15 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-04-17T14:34:20 <Justin_o_> cindyli: I just pushed up the changes to the class names and comments
2017-04-17T14:34:25 <Justin_o_> I\'ll be dropping offline now though
2017-04-17T14:34:36 <Justin_o_> If i have time I\'ll look at anything else you might have found later
