2017-12-21T09:15:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> @amatas, if I update a config to have multiple environments, is there any way to specify that only one should run by default?
2017-12-21T09:15:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci#working-with-vms
2017-12-21T09:16:06 <the-t-in-rtf1> As discussed in the last meeting, I want to update infusion to use your work and have both a Windows and Linux environment.
2017-12-21T09:16:35 <the-t-in-rtf1> I\'d like vagrant ci test to default to using linux, but for vagrant ci test windows to run the tests in windows.
2017-12-21T09:16:52 <the-t-in-rtf1> I suspect I\'d need to define parallel sets of test stages for this to work, you could comment on that.
2017-12-21T09:17:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> i.e. how would I have separate setup stages for each environment?
2017-12-21T09:18:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> Actually, nm, your docs are really good now.
2017-12-21T09:18:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> I see an example of how to do exactly what I want.
2017-12-21T09:18:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> strong work!
2017-12-21T09:19:12 <the-t-in-rtf1> Is v: the default for windows VMs?
2017-12-21T09:20:12 <the-t-in-rtf1> I guess all I need to know is if there\'s a way to specify that the linux vm should be used by default.
2017-12-21T09:20:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> @amatas ^^^
2017-12-21T09:20:29 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can figure out the rest with the tags feature.
2017-12-21T09:20:45 <amatas> :)
2017-12-21T09:21:06 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf1: yes the v: mapping is set by default in our windows vms
2017-12-21T09:21:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, is it the default cwd for tests.
2017-12-21T09:21:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> I know that part... ;)
2017-12-21T09:21:24 <amatas> ah, no, sorry
2017-12-21T09:21:31 <amatas> the default path is c:\\vagrant
2017-12-21T09:22:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> yeah, I\'ll bring it up if the tests won\'t run from there, usually it\'s only a problem with anything that depends on leveldown.
2017-12-21T09:22:26 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, is there a way to have "vagrant ci test" default to a particular VM in a multi-environment config?
2017-12-21T09:23:18 <amatas> if you set the variable autostart: true, that vm will spin up by default
2017-12-21T09:23:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> I guess in a multi-environment config, "vagrant ci test" provisions all environments?
2017-12-21T09:23:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> ah.
2017-12-21T09:23:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> right, so I set the linux one to autostart and then "vagrant ci test windows" can be used to manually launch the other?
2017-12-21T09:23:44 <amatas> all the vms with that variable set to true will run by default
2017-12-21T09:23:52 <amatas> right
2017-12-21T09:23:55 <the-t-in-rtf1> that\'s awesome.
2017-12-21T09:24:06 <amatas> :)
2017-12-21T09:24:10 <the-t-in-rtf1> I probably will only have time to write it up this week, but I\'m excited to try it out.
2017-12-21T09:24:29 <amatas> ping me if you find any trouble
2017-12-21T09:24:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> will do, thanks.
2017-12-21T09:27:27 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, is there an implicit "all" tag for all vms?
2017-12-21T09:27:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> or can I just tag them both with "all" and tell people to run "vagrant ci test all" to test everything?
2017-12-21T09:28:09 <amatas> if I remember well there is no tag implicit
2017-12-21T09:28:35 <the-t-in-rtf1> But I can add an arbitrary tag, like "all" to each VM, right?
2017-12-21T09:28:40 <amatas> right
2017-12-21T09:28:43 <the-t-in-rtf1> great, that works.

2017-12-21T16:53:58 <Justin_o> sure

2017-12-21T16:54:07 <Justin_o> michelled: ^
2017-12-21T16:57:57 <jhernandez> stegru: mmm, not really - IIRC, I made a first proposal based on another from Steve Githens, then, after a few meetings we ended up with the current "contract" - so yeah, there\'s no such "official" documentation
2017-12-21T16:58:51 <stegru> ok thanks jhernandez - it\'s very good, by the way
2017-12-21T16:59:26 <jhernandez> BUT, we follow https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PrimarySchemaForPreferencesFramework.html
2017-12-21T17:00:01 <stegru> ah ok
2017-12-21T17:00:22 <jhernandez> which I\'d say it\'s our "official documentation" now
2017-12-21T17:03:21 <jhernandez> I guess that at some point we will need to go through all the data in our solutions registry and spot relevant things, I remember that there were several "special settings" that weren\'t easy to describe, but in general, infusion\'s primary schema does the work for almost everything
2017-12-21T17:04:16 <stegru> yeh
2017-12-21T17:05:15 <stegru> another thing, jhernandez - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L972
2017-12-21T17:05:35 <stegru> that configuration block is only there because start/stop blocks don\'t work without one
2017-12-21T17:07:15 <stegru> I\'ll rephrase: I tried very hard to find a setting, just for the sake of having a setting block
2017-12-21T17:08:41 * kavya joined the channel
2017-12-21T17:10:13 <jhernandez> stegru: right, I added that comment because in this particular case, we\'re not setting anything but starting/stopping a solution, which is a "special thing" that at some point we need to render on the PSP
2017-12-21T17:12:56 <jhernandez> I guess that this is the kind of things that we will be able to support after converting the lifecycle actions to behave like settings handlers
2017-12-21T17:13:22 <jhernandez> which is being done by the evil kasparnet

2017-12-21T18:17:45 <jhung> michelled: the current theme is the Snow theme found here https://github.com/jhung/snow-theme. It\'s basically just the BIG IDeA theme.
2017-12-21T18:18:30 <jhung> michelled: the theme that is currently on the snow-dev site can be deleted. There wasn\'t anything done that was important.
