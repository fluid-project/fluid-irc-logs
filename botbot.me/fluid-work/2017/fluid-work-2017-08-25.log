2017-08-25T18:36:48 <cindyli> simonjb: if the answer is yes, at granting access tokens to gpii installations, the existence of the sent-in gpii token should not be checked because it might be anonymous
2017-08-25T18:38:36 * ussjoin joined the channel
2017-08-25T18:41:51 <simonjb> cindyli: Up until now, the model has been to only store gpii tokens in the database that have associated users, and to consider tokens not in the database as \'anonymous\'
2017-08-25T18:42:50 <simonjb> provisioning a new token does not require writing anything to the auth database
2017-08-25T18:43:02 <simonjb> only when it\'s associated to a user
2017-08-25T18:43:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-25T18:43:39 <simonjb> now, whether this is the right model going forward is a very good question
2017-08-25T18:44:05 <simonjb> we have had a separation between the auth database and the preferences database
2017-08-25T18:44:30 <simonjb> an option going forward would be to move them closer together
2017-08-25T18:44:45 * ussjoin joined the channel
2017-08-25T18:45:16 <simonjb> so, right now, a gpii token document in the db means that it\'s been added to a user account
2017-08-25T18:45:30 <simonjb> rather than some preferences exist for that token
2017-08-25T18:45:54 <simonjb> the auth database doesn\'t know which preferences exist and which do not
2017-08-25T18:47:28 <simonjb> cindyli: if the current code checks for a gpii token before issuing an access token, it will only work for \'registered\' or \'non-anonymous\' tokens
2017-08-25T18:51:04 <cindyli> simonjb: if so, is it correct that it doesn\'t make sense to check for a gpii token at issuing an access token as gpii installations should work with any gpii tokens, anonymous or registered?
2017-08-25T18:52:27 <simonjb> thinking...
2017-08-25T18:53:40 <simonjb> cindyli: in the current implementation, does the gpiiToken property of gpiiAppInstallationAuthorizations store the actual token value or the id of the token record?
2017-08-25T18:54:08 <cindyli> simonjb: it stores the actual token value
2017-08-25T18:55:03 <simonjb> ok, so it would be fairly easy to just remove the check and we could support gpiiAppInstallationAuthorization docs without any paired gpiiToken doc
2017-08-25T18:55:08 <simonjb> ?
2017-08-25T18:55:10 <cindyli> simonjb: no, it actually stores the id of the token record
2017-08-25T18:55:17 <cindyli> sad...
2017-08-25T18:55:20 <simonjb> ok
2017-08-25T18:57:47 <simonjb> we should maybe rename the property to gpiiTokenId if we continue with that model
2017-08-25T18:57:59 <simonjb> but let\'s think through this first
2017-08-25T18:59:08 <cindyli> simonjb: we probably should save the actual token value, like what webPrefsConsumerAuthorization does
2017-08-25T19:00:11 <simonjb> it would be good, I think, to have consistency
2017-08-25T19:01:56 <simonjb> the question we need to answer is: do we want to have entries in the auth database for all provisioned tokens
2017-08-25T19:02:09 <simonjb> Bosmon, are you around?
2017-08-25T19:02:47 <grrrero> jhung: Do you know anything about the UIO Wordpress Plugin?
2017-08-25T19:03:37 <simonjb> cindyli: and for onboardedSolutionAuthorization, it is also the token value?
2017-08-25T19:03:55 <ussjoin> simonjb cindyli: I\'m confused; the system as it currently stands just accepts any input as "anonymous" if it\'s not in the database?
2017-08-25T19:04:48 <simonjb> ussjoin: in particular, a gpii token value, for the purpose of filtering the contents
2017-08-25T19:05:18 <simonjb> the preferences are stored keyed by gpii token
2017-08-25T19:05:44 <cindyli> simonjb: onboardedSolutionAuthorization uses the token value too
2017-08-25T19:05:56 <simonjb> and optionally, a user can register a token with a user account (username, password)
2017-08-25T19:06:30 <simonjb> when a gpii token is registered with an account, it enables the owner to do some management
2017-08-25T19:06:47 <simonjb> such as revoke and add additional preferences filtering to it
2017-08-25T19:07:04 <simonjb> such as this gpii token can only be used with these solutions
2017-08-25T19:07:22 <simonjb> and for solution A, only share this subset of preferences
2017-08-25T19:07:39 <simonjb> if a token isn\'t associated to an account, we consider it \'anonymous\'
2017-08-25T19:07:46 <jhung> grrrero: a little.
2017-08-25T19:07:50 <simonjb> and don\'t do any privacy filtering on it
2017-08-25T19:08:08 <grrrero> jhung: Any docs on this available anywhere yet?
2017-08-25T19:08:14 <simonjb> the full preferences are always available to the match making system when the token is used
2017-08-25T19:09:01 <simonjb> in the \'anonymous\' case
2017-08-25T19:09:17 <jhung> There isn\'t much documentation grrrero. There\'s a little on the Wiki https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/UI+Options+Wordpres+Plugin+Development+Guide
2017-08-25T19:09:37 <grrrero> jhung: Good start!! Thanks!
2017-08-25T19:10:05 <jhung> The readme might have some as well, but it\'s been something we should definitely improve grrrero. I think there may be a Jira for improving the plugin docs.
2017-08-25T19:10:22 * stegru joined the channel
2017-08-25T19:10:37 <grrrero> jhung: Will look more into it; Justin_o has this as a JIRA to use responsive UIO
2017-08-25T19:10:57 <jhung> grrrero: Yes! That would be awesome.
2017-08-25T19:11:01 * kasparnet has quit
2017-08-25T19:11:25 <simonjb> ussjoin: and now cindyli is adding oauth2 checking to the endpoint used by the local flow manager to retrieve settings
2017-08-25T19:12:22 <ussjoin> But the tokens aren\'t recorded anywhere---so I can send, say, "\' OR 1=1 AND DROP TABLE Users;\'" as my OAuth token and that\'ll just get marked as anonymous?
2017-08-25T19:12:33 <ussjoin> (My SQL syntax is, of course, wrong.)
2017-08-25T19:12:53 <simonjb> no, gpii token := oauth2 token
2017-08-25T19:13:07 <simonjb> sorry, gpii token != oauth2 token
2017-08-25T19:13:28 <ussjoin> Gotcha. So as my GPII token, then?
2017-08-25T19:13:34 <simonjb> yes
2017-08-25T19:13:54 <simonjb> but it will result in no preferences
2017-08-25T19:14:59 <simonjb> for each gpii token that has preferences, there will be an entry in the preferences database
2017-08-25T19:15:22 <simonjb> but right now, not every gpii token has an entry in the \'auth\' database
2017-08-25T19:15:37 <simonjb> only ones that have been registered with an account
2017-08-25T19:15:50 <simonjb> cindyli: did I get that right?
2017-08-25T19:16:13 <cindyli> yes, simonjb
2017-08-25T19:16:24 <gtirloni> simonjb: is it correct to say that the components accessing the preferences database are only doing GET requests so data modification/removal is not allowed (if they were to manipulate the input data trying to tricky the system into doing something harmful)?
2017-08-25T19:17:59 <simonjb> gtirloni: as of right now, I believe that there is a totally unprotected endpoint that will let you write preferences -- is this still the case as far as you know cindyli?
2017-08-25T19:19:23 <cindyli> yes, at the moment, the only update/write endpoint is provided by the preferences server and it is unprotected
2017-08-25T19:19:33 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Trying to run vagrant up on my local machine but getting this error
2017-08-25T19:19:36 <grrrero> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/MxCMOkpG/
2017-08-25T19:19:47 * jhernandez has quit
2017-08-25T19:19:49 <grrrero> Anyone know how to fix this?
2017-08-25T19:20:25 <cindyli> gtirloni: one task on my list is to add a secured endpoint on the cloud based flow manager which we hope would be the only component that is able to send requests to the unsecured preferences server endpoint
2017-08-25T19:20:45 <gtirloni> grrrero: looks like the server where the box file is located is having some trouble, i\'d try again a few times
2017-08-25T19:20:56 <grrrero> gtirloni: Ok, thanks!
2017-08-25T19:21:14 <cindyli> i hope there\'s a way to config the unsecured end point not to be accessible by other parties
2017-08-25T19:21:29 <ussjoin> gtirloni: Also, remember that SQLi and similar input manipulations don\'t respect HTTP verbs---they work at a deeper level.
2017-08-25T19:21:44 <simonjb> and the cloud based flow manager endpoint will only allow a subset of the preferences to be edited? am I remembering correctly? only the ones supported by the pcp with memory
2017-08-25T19:22:12 <ussjoin> grrrero: Concur with gtirloni---but a wget on that file worked for me, so it might just be a transient CDN error.
2017-08-25T19:22:12 <cindyli> that\'s true, ussjoin
2017-08-25T19:22:32 <grrrero> ussjoin: Yeah it started up for me on 2nd try! Thanks!!
2017-08-25T19:22:40 <gtirloni> ussjoin: that\'s interesting, i didn\'t know that. in our case it\'s couchdb so i\'m thinking we\'re doing direct requests to it (from the preferences server), but i\'m not sure if we\'re using some ORM-like package
2017-08-25T19:22:41 <grrrero> gtirloni ^
2017-08-25T19:24:39 <simonjb> gtirloni, ussjoin: I think in general we are pretty careful about not building machine instructions with string concatenation, so hopefully injection attacks should be not common but is absolutely something to verify, 100%
2017-08-25T19:24:57 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'m going to modify the pull request for GPII-2435 to use token values for "gpiiToken" fields associated with gpiiAppInstallationAuthorizations
2017-08-25T19:25:08 <gtirloni> grrrero: cool! the box is hosted on our cdn (cachefly) but vagrant first does a request to vagrantcloud\'s API, gets a HTTP redirect and goes looking for it in the CDN.. that web service sometimes has some problems, but they\'re usually quick to fix. glad it\'s working. I don\'t know which OS you\'re using, but if the download % seems stalled, don\'t panic.. it uses curl behind the scenes and sometimes there\'s some trouble with buffering in vagrant
2017-08-25T19:25:29 <grrrero> gtirloni: download completed, so it\'s all good! Thank you :)
2017-08-25T19:25:30 <gtirloni> cindyli simonjb: nice, thanks for the details
2017-08-25T19:26:46 <gtirloni> grrrero: if you don\'t mind me asking, which project are you spinning up? curious about the centos box (vs fedora)
2017-08-25T19:26:50 <cindyli> simonjb: in terms of whether the auth database should store all gpii tokens, we need a discussion with more ppl. for now, I\'m going to assume the auth database doesn\'t have all gpii token records
2017-08-25T19:27:07 <grrrero> gtirloni: I\'m opening the Wordpress UIO plugin
2017-08-25T19:27:09 <cindyli> that means I will remove the check of gpii tokens at granting access tokens for gpii app installation
2017-08-25T19:27:12 <cindyli> s
2017-08-25T19:27:20 <cindyli> do you think that\'s ok?
2017-08-25T19:27:24 <cindyli> simonjb: ^
2017-08-25T19:27:56 <gtirloni> grrrero: ah ok, i worked on that automation a whiiiile ago, i hope it\'s littered with "here be dragons" warnings. jhung and I can help with any issues you find out
2017-08-25T19:28:07 <grrrero> Awesome thanks gtirloni and jhung
2017-08-25T19:28:45 <jhung> gtirloni: It\'s an oldie, but a goodie.
2017-08-25T19:28:50 <gtirloni> jhung: lol
2017-08-25T19:28:56 <ussjoin> simonjb cindyli: Even if SQLi isn\'t the principal issue, it seems like allowing unconfirmable tokens in is likely to lead to issues. What would be involved in recording all tokens and validating them (both in form, first, before anything is done, and then later that they actually exist)?
2017-08-25T19:32:38 <simonjb> ussjoin cindyli: I think I spoke too quickly about not using string concatenation -- we do use string replacement
2017-08-25T19:32:45 <simonjb> for example https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L135
2017-08-25T19:33:15 <simonjb> we should definitely validate in form as ussjoin says
2017-08-25T19:33:51 <cindyli> ussjoin: i agree it would be safer to keep track of all issued gpii tokens and think about the workflow of provisioning new gpii tokens
2017-08-25T19:39:36 <simonjb> actually, maybe we do URL escaping when we populate the view URLs? if not that would be worth doing, but I think also validating token form as early as possible is also very good to do
2017-08-25T19:42:57 <simonjb> ok, sorry, looks like we do encode the termMap values: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-url.js#L75
2017-08-25T19:47:36 <cindyli> well.. I\'m blocked by whether all gpii tokens will be tracked :(
2017-08-25T19:48:40 <ussjoin> cindyli: Can we change the answer from no to yes? It feels like that\'s doable, but I\'m not familiar with the code, so you\'re a better judge of the possibility of that statement.
2017-08-25T19:49:22 <simonjb> cindyli: is the "Input validation" entry on https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Security_Plan the best place to track validation of gpii token format?
2017-08-25T19:49:58 <simonjb> as a task
2017-08-25T19:50:10 <ussjoin> If tokens are all tracked, then we can do the two-part check I alluded to above: first, check (really simple regexes are good, though there are often even stronger checks) that the token is of the form a token should be (e.g., "exactly 22 characters, lowercase alpha + numbers, no punctuation" or whatever it happens to be). Then, IFF the first check passed and the other first-line validations passed, check if the token is in the
2017-08-25T19:50:10 <ussjoin> database.
2017-08-25T19:54:09 <cindyli> ussjoin: it\'s technically doable. we need to check with the UX team on the workflow of provisioning gpii tokens and figure out how we can track them in the databse
2017-08-25T19:54:42 <cindyli> simonjb: that seems a reasonable place to track
2017-08-25T19:54:55 <simonjb> cindyli: I will add a note
2017-08-25T19:54:58 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2017-08-25T19:56:13 <cindyli> ussjoin, simonjb, i can bring up this question, about tracking all gpii tokens, in the arch meeting next week
2017-08-25T20:00:03 <ussjoin> Cool; thank you.
2017-08-25T20:01:47 <cindyli> simonjb, ussjoin, for now, I will assume all gpii tokens are tracked but not all of them are associated with user accounts
2017-08-25T20:02:12 <cindyli> simonjb: i will still update the pull request for GPII-2435 to use token values for gpiiToken fields
2017-08-25T20:02:37 <cindyli> i mean for gpii app installation authorization records
2017-08-25T20:03:01 <simonjb> cindyli: that seems like a good approach for now and I agree on making gpiiToken values consistent across authorization types
2017-08-25T20:03:23 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2017-08-25T20:03:26 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-08-25T20:04:28 <simonjb> cindyli: and in the short term, for testing, we can manually add gpii tokens to the database before we sort out provisioning
2017-08-25T20:05:22 <cindyli> simonjb: yes, that\'s how i\'m thinking to fix the acceptance test for using anonymous tokens with /untrusted-settings endpoint
2017-08-25T20:06:01 <cindyli> simonjb: it would be a much more complex story in reality
2017-08-25T20:06:53 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, we will need to work through the provisioning process and relationship between auth data and prefs data
2017-08-25T20:07:53 <cindyli> ya, worry about the timeline for pcp with memory
2017-08-25T20:09:44 <simonjb> thanks for bringing this up cindyli :)
2017-08-25T20:10:31 <cindyli> no problem. thanks for explanations and ideas, simonjb and ussjoin
2017-08-25T20:10:43 <simonjb> ussjoin: great that you are available to help us!

2017-08-25T13:24:55 <javjarfer> I\'m trying to use it to resolve a value of a payload for a test, but isn\'t so trivial

2017-08-25T13:27:56 <javjarfer> yes, I have it, just a second

2017-08-25T13:33:37 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-08-25T13:35:14 <stegru> not answering your question, but CWD will be the current directory when gpii was started.. which could be anything (but normally the gpii root)
2017-08-25T13:35:33 <Bosmon> javjarfer__ - also, CWD is not set as a standard variable on my system
2017-08-25T13:35:46 <Bosmon> Are you perhaps trying to apply some Linux thinking here to Windows?
2017-08-25T13:37:36 <stegru> ah, it\'s "CD".. but that\'s not a real variable
2017-08-25T13:37:54 <stegru> %CD%
2017-08-25T13:38:07 <Bosmon> ah how interesting
2017-08-25T13:38:15 <Bosmon> And does it appear nonetheless in node\'s process.env?
2017-08-25T13:38:19 <stegru> no
2017-08-25T13:38:22 <Bosmon> Right
2017-08-25T13:38:24 <stegru> just checked
2017-08-25T13:38:39 <javjarfer> yes yes, I have implemented it as process.cwd();
2017-08-25T13:39:04 <javjarfer> it is not a standard variable
2017-08-25T13:39:22 <javjarfer> and it has suffered change in different versions of node for what I have been reading
2017-08-25T13:40:08 <stegru> oh, you did process.env.CWD = process.cwd() ?
2017-08-25T13:40:20 <Bosmon> That\'s terrible
2017-08-25T13:40:40 <Bosmon> Anyway, please see stegru\'s earlier comment
2017-08-25T13:40:41 <javjarfer> well in resolver I did = if (name == "CWD) return process.cwd();
2017-08-25T13:40:59 <javjarfer> not actually setting a variable in node process, just using
2017-08-25T13:41:02 <Bosmon> The value of CWD is not a stable determiner of a position in the filesystem
2017-08-25T13:41:10 <Bosmon> javjarfer - consider this some early code review :)
2017-08-25T13:42:03 <javjarfer> haha thanks, I know it isn\'t but I have see that files are loaded like that is several tests, using the _dirname variable from node
2017-08-25T13:42:17 <Bosmon> javjarfer__ - well that\'s completely different, isn\'t it
2017-08-25T13:42:34 <Bosmon> _dirname at least has a knowable value given a particular file in the filesystem
2017-08-25T13:42:38 <Bosmon> Whereas CWD doesn\'t
2017-08-25T13:42:53 <Bosmon> And, indeed you will only see such stuff in test cases
2017-08-25T13:43:08 <Bosmon> For something that you intend to use in production, I suggest you use some kind of module-relative path as described in http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/NodeAPI.html#node-js-module-apis
2017-08-25T13:43:24 <stegru> for tests especially, the "CWD" could be anything, depending on how the test is invoked.. eg, "node tests/UnitTests.js" or "cd tests ; node UnitTests.js" will give different values
2017-08-25T13:45:04 <stegru> you could copy the wallpaper to %temp%, then use {environment}.temp
2017-08-25T13:45:24 <javjarfer> yes, thanks, I know that is not the best way to get the path, thanks for the tip about the module-relative, I will look at it :), but it was just a hack for being if I was able to call the resolution on payloads for tests
2017-08-25T13:46:12 <javjarfer> stegru, that is really simple, could be an approach yes, I will also consider it when looking to the module-relative
2017-08-25T13:46:15 <javjarfer> thanks
2017-08-25T13:49:44 <stegru> unfusions documentation is really good, it always impresses me
2017-08-25T13:49:57 <stegru> so is infusion\'s
2017-08-25T13:50:23 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-25T13:52:02 <Bosmon> javjarfer - ok, the point of tests is that they are self-contained, so the true environment resolvers are generally disabled
2017-08-25T13:53:11 <Bosmon> javjarfer - a mock "nameResolver" is injected here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Testing.js#L124

2017-08-25T13:56:44 <javjarfer> Bosmon, okay, thanks you, I get your point, for this kind of self content test is better to simply mock that part, in order to keep the result self contained
2017-08-25T13:59:44 <cindyli> hi simonjb, thanks for more reviews on the pull request for GPII-2435. i\'ve addressed them and pushed up.
2017-08-25T14:00:40 <simonjb> thanks cindyli, I\'ll take a look
2017-08-25T14:01:36 <cindyli> simonjb: just received a notification of your last comment, the push doesn\'t include the fix for that one ;) i will wait for a bunch to come and do another round of fix
2017-08-25T14:02:06 <simonjb> :)
2017-08-25T14:05:57 <javjarfer> Bosmon, those are great resources to look at, is there any doc about the mocks or the \'design\' followed for doing the integration tests?
2017-08-25T14:10:06 * michelled joined the channel
2017-08-25T14:11:52 <Bosmon> javjarfer - sadly no docs for this design, no
2017-08-25T14:12:01 <Bosmon> We just have general docs for those writing acceptance tests here: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Writing_Acceptance_Tests

2017-08-25T17:43:17 <michelled> alanharnum, grrrero: I think you\'ll find this article danayo tweeted to be super interesting: https://qz.com/1042852/using-a-fitness-app-taught-me-the-scary-truth-about-why-privacy-settings-are-a-feminist-issue/
2017-08-25T17:44:35 <michelled> danayo: thanks for sharing that - I guess we have a ton more work to do in that space
2017-08-25T17:44:58 <alanharnum> michelled danayo grrrero yeah, super-interesting
2017-08-25T17:46:01 <alanharnum> & I think a part of the whole pathology of the tech world that bases its sense of precaution, safety and privacy on almost exclusively the experiences of white male engineers implementing products
2017-08-25T17:48:36 <grrrero> alanharnum: danayo: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t like something, you can opt out of it\xe2\x80\x9d -- this concept technically lets companies wash their hands off of issues like this
2017-08-25T17:49:44 <grrrero> It\'s interesting how they\'ll suddenly be super pro-privacy when a user tries to gain more control over their own experiences and then companies will just say "but you didn\'t opt on so like \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf"
2017-08-25T17:49:53 <grrrero> *opt out
2017-08-25T17:50:07 <alanharnum> yeah, it\'s interesting how even the article contains this phrasing: "Failing to opt out of Leaderboards was admittedly my blunder." - it\'s a very pervasive idea
2017-08-25T17:50:40 <grrrero> Yeah as if the fault is all on the user side
2017-08-25T17:50:41 <ussjoin> It\'s also going to be exciting when the GDPR beats these companies with a very large hammer indeed. 4% of worldwide gross revenue for reasonable expectation violations or cross-use without *explicit opt-in* consent.
2017-08-25T17:50:41 <alanharnum> as the author points out, how many companies manage privacy fails the Clapham omnibus / reasonable person test
2017-08-25T17:51:34 <ussjoin> (Or IIRC 20M in penalties, whichever is *higher*. So if you company makes less than 20M, the first GDPR violation will be your last.)

2017-08-25T18:32:53 <cindyli> hi simonjb, when a gpii installation sends a request to /access_token endpoint to request an access token, it sends along the gpii token. right now, this gpii token is verified to ensure it does exist in the auth database - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2435/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/src/AuthorizationService.js#L224
2017-08-25T18:33:09 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-08-25T18:33:32 <cindyli> when I\'m working on securing /untrusted-settings endpoint, i noticed it\'s able to handle anonymous gpii tokens - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2435/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L261
2017-08-25T18:34:52 <cindyli> the latter code seems assuming not all gpii tokens are stored in the auth database
2017-08-25T18:35:48 <cindyli> i\'d like to check with you if the auth database only meant to store gpii tokens that have authorizations associated with?
