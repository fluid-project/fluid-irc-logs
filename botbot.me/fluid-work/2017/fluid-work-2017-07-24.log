b'2017-07-24T20:04:01 <colinclark> If I had to guess, the vast majority of the cases we\'re talking about are really "clients of the preferences framework"
2017-07-24T20:04:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not sure, there are grunt plugins for doing just that, so i think it may just be documented
2017-07-24T20:04:29 <colinclark> grrrero: Is there a grunt plugin we\'re looking at using?
2017-07-24T20:04:48 <grrrero> Yep there is
2017-07-24T20:04:51 <grrrero> I just got one to work
2017-07-24T20:04:54 <grrrero> colinclark
2017-07-24T20:05:02 <colinclark> cool, which one is it?
2017-07-24T20:05:17 <grrrero> colinclark: https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont
2017-07-24T20:05:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: in terms of the icon repo, it may just be a large collection, it could be organized by project, or maybe just flat.. i guess there are options
2017-07-24T20:09:16 <colinclark> well, this all sounds great
2017-07-24T20:09:21 <colinclark> what will you call the repository?
2017-07-24T20:10:03 <colinclark> And in regards to the license, if it contained nothing but images I\'d say that you can simply CC-license it. In this case, since you\'ll have scripts, go ahead and use the BSD-3 license
2017-07-24T20:10:03 <Justin_o> colinclark: good question, grrrero did you have any thoughts on that?
2017-07-24T20:10:36 <grrrero> Justin_o, colinclark: Will have to think about that!
2017-07-24T20:10:50 <colinclark> infusion-fonts might be your boring name
2017-07-24T20:11:05 <colinclark> coming up with a clever tea/coffee/beverage-related name is bonus :)
2017-07-24T20:11:22 <Justin_o> colinclark: also not sure we should call it fonts, maybe icons instead
2017-07-24T20:11:27 <grrrero> iconvfefe? colinclark, Justin_o haha
2017-07-24T20:11:31 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-07-24T20:11:50 <colinclark> In general, I\'d prefer to avoid bothering with the ECL for anything new\xe2\x80\x94it just isn\'t a very widely used license and is (unnecessarily) more restrictive than the 3-clause BSD
2017-07-24T20:11:51 <Justin_o> grrrero: can you explain that one, i\'m not coffee literate
2017-07-24T20:12:03 <colinclark> that wasn\'t a coffee reference, Justin_o :)
2017-07-24T20:12:09 <grrrero> Justin_o: oh no,
2017-07-24T20:12:17 <Justin_o> ah okay :)
2017-07-24T20:12:44 <grrrero> Justin_o: behold! https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/covfefe-trump-twitter.html
2017-07-24T20:12:48 <colinclark> :)
2017-07-24T20:14:07 <grrrero> Justin_o: Basically nobody *truly* knows what covfefe means, only Trump does (or doesn\'t) :)
2017-07-24T20:14:34 <gmoss> both coffee and fonts can be bold, maybe there\'s a pun to be had there
2017-07-24T20:14:44 <grrrero> And beer!
2017-07-24T20:14:57 <colinclark> I love coffee
2017-07-24T20:15:07 <colinclark> so good
2017-07-24T20:15:42 <grrrero> colinclark: It is
2017-07-24T20:16:02 <colinclark> do you make coffee at home or buy it, grrrero?
2017-07-24T20:16:06 <grrrero> I\'m actually gonna make a pot of coffee if anyone wants some
2017-07-24T20:16:17 <grrrero> colinclark: I bring my own beans :D
2017-07-24T20:16:22 <colinclark> brilliant!
2017-07-24T20:16:35 <Justin_o> I really think i need to organize a new coffee taste test
2017-07-24T20:16:51 <grrrero> This is the coffee I have at the office: https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/
2017-07-24T20:17:08 <colinclark> ooh, I don\'t think I\'ve had their coffee
2017-07-24T20:17:17 <grrrero> I quite like it! colinclark
2017-07-24T20:17:58 <grrrero> The one I get is the black cat espresso
2017-07-24T20:18:03 <colinclark> I\'ve mostly been drinking this coffee recently: https://propellercoffee.com/public
2017-07-24T20:18:13 <colinclark> since I\'ve more or less stopped roasting at home now
2017-07-24T20:20:19 <grrrero> colinclark: This looks good!!

2017-07-24T19:08:09 <gmoss> looks great alanharnum! i'm excited to use this site, should be very useful in becoming more familiar with infusion

2017-07-24T19:54:43 <colinclark> What are the SVG icons for? Infusion? Something else?
2017-07-24T19:55:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: for infusion to start, but could be for any of our projects really
2017-07-24T19:55:02 <colinclark> And does it include only SVGs or other artefacts as well, such as build scripts?
2017-07-24T19:55:31 <colinclark> What's the motivation for a) storing SVGs separately and b) for combining multiple projects' icons together?
2017-07-24T19:56:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: likely other artifacts for illustrator, for adding actions to normalize the artboards and exporting.. basically to maintain consistency
2017-07-24T19:56:25 <colinclark> what form do those take, Justin_o?
2017-07-24T19:56:39 <Justin_o> colinclark: seems like some sort of script, but grrrero and jhung would know better
2017-07-24T19:56:52 <colinclark> great
2017-07-24T19:56:56 <colinclark> tell me more, grrrero! :)
2017-07-24T19:57:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: regarding storing them together, we have icons that get used across projects.  The thinking is that we can use npm to pull in the svg repo and do a build in the specific project to compile the icon font with only the icons the project requires
2017-07-24T19:57:45 <jhung> colinclark, Justin_o, grrrero - I'll be AFK for a couple minutes. brb
2017-07-24T19:58:34 <colinclark> What projects are the icons used across?
2017-07-24T19:58:40 <colinclark> and what are the icons of?
2017-07-24T19:59:11 <grrrero> colinclark, Justin_o: We're thinking of creating 3 sets of Illustrator actions that anyone can use; basically to first, normalise to the desired aspect ratio; second to export to SVG using a consistent bunch of settings; and third to do actions 1 and 2 to make it more seamless
2017-07-24T19:59:22 <colinclark> oh sweet
2017-07-24T19:59:24 <colinclark> that sounds awesome
2017-07-24T19:59:32 <grrrero> colinclark: Then we'd create an SVG repo to put these actions and SVGs in
2017-07-24T19:59:45 <grrrero> Err well not sure about the actions, but at least the SVGs
2017-07-24T19:59:55 <grrrero> So that we're versioning the icons
2017-07-24T20:00:07 <colinclark> that seems pretty reasonable to me
2017-07-24T20:00:16 <grrrero> And like what Justin_o said, can choose to include them through a build script on a per project basis
2017-07-24T20:00:55 <colinclark> so you'd publish an npm module containing the icons, and dependent projects could then use them?
2017-07-24T20:01:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: regarding all the sharing, maybe double check with dana and jhung, i think we had cases with gpii, infusion, metadata, feedback, first discovery. I'm trying to remember exactly, but i think we had cases before where a project had 2 or 3 font icon files, and there some duplicates between them
2017-07-24T20:01:25 <grrrero> Yep if I got that right, Justin_o?
2017-07-24T20:01:54 <Justin_o> grrrero: sounded about right, i think we would want to version the actions too though, in case we make changes later and etc.
2017-07-24T20:02:08 <grrrero> Right, Justin_o
2017-07-24T20:02:28 <colinclark> I think this is all a very good idea
2017-07-24T20:02:56 <colinclark> The only thing I'd like us to be clear on is what this repository ultimately represents
2017-07-24T20:03:03 <colinclark> perhaps it's just a fluid community repository of tons of icons
2017-07-24T20:03:12 <colinclark> that we share
2017-07-24T20:03:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: the npm module would have the svgs, the project itself would convert them into an icon font.. additionally these icons could be used as svg icons if the project wanted to go that route.
2017-07-24T20:03:37 <colinclark> would the npm module provide the means by which a project would build their own icon font?
