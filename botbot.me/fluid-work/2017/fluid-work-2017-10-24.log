2017-10-24T16:06:29 <alanharnum> michelled: aurgh, I think there is one scheduled, but we missed sending out notice
2017-10-24T16:06:43 <alanharnum> michelled: I\'ll send something out and make sure I\'m around in case anyone wants to talk

2017-10-24T17:55:34 <michelled> alanharnum, gmoss: is the storytelling tool repo in the fluid-project org?
2017-10-24T17:55:45 <gmoss> michelled: it is not
2017-10-24T17:55:58 <gmoss> not yet anyway :)
2017-10-24T17:56:53 <michelled> is there any reason it is not?
2017-10-24T17:57:23 <michelled> I guess I\'m wondering - what do we need to do to get it there :)
2017-10-24T17:57:35 <gmoss> michelled: i think it\'s the nature of how we started development. alanharnum and I just began to pair on his machine, and we\'ve never moved it over haha
2017-10-24T17:57:41 <gmoss> it lives here, btw: https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-storyTelling
2017-10-24T17:57:51 <gmoss> and there\'s a fork on my account where I do my work
2017-10-24T17:57:52 <michelled> cool, I think if it\'s got tests, we should move it
2017-10-24T17:58:04 <alanharnum> yeah it\'s all got tests
2017-10-24T17:58:21 <alanharnum> i can initiate a repo transfer
2017-10-24T17:58:27 <michelled> thanks!
2017-10-24T17:58:52 <gmoss> so from here on out, i\'ll make my PR\'s against the fluid-project version, correct?
2017-10-24T17:58:53 <michelled> gmoss: you mentioned that the demo on the build site is out of date - is the build not working?
2017-10-24T17:59:02 <michelled> gmoss: yes, that\'s right
2017-10-24T17:59:34 <gmoss> michelled: okay thanks :) re the demo build, it\'s auto-published from the deployment branch, it\'s just been a little while since we\'ve pulled against it
2017-10-24T18:00:09 <gmoss> I don\'t see why we couldn\'t get that updated
2017-10-24T18:00:41 <michelled> gmoss: I would think we could just deploy master? or keep those two in sync
2017-10-24T18:01:04 <michelled> given that the intention of the build site is to show the current status
2017-10-24T18:01:22 <gmoss> michelled: Perhaps once we have the repo moved over to fluid-project, we can get the CI reconfigured and point it at master, then. that makes sense to me
2017-10-24T18:01:38 <alanharnum> michelled: I think it could be safely switched over to master at this point
2017-10-24T18:01:38 <gmoss> the "current best stable version" if you will
2017-10-24T18:01:47 <alanharnum> i did the deploy-branch thing when it was very early stage
2017-10-24T18:01:48 <michelled> sounds great to me
2017-10-24T18:01:58 <michelled> alanharnum: makes sense
2017-10-24T18:02:23 <gmoss> alanharnum: if there\'s any way for me to help with this process, please let me know :)

2017-10-24T12:31:55 <javjarfer> hi stegru! Good morning, do you have any snippet for testing message windows with this function? https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644953(v=vs.85).aspx
2017-10-24T12:33:47 <stegru> javjarfer: just searched.. no
2017-10-24T12:34:27 <stegru> you\'re calling this from node?
2017-10-24T12:36:29 <javjarfer> no, I was just wondering if you had an easy way to do it for inspecting before making some script or something
2017-10-24T12:36:40 <javjarfer> could be valuable for the ongoing settings research
2017-10-24T12:39:08 <stegru> I\'m not sure what you mean.. but I\'ve done nothing with that function anyway, javjarfer
2017-10-24T12:40:09 <stegru> I use PostMessage instead, I believe it\'s (almost) the same
2017-10-24T12:40:29 <javjarfer> stegru, oh, well I observed a call to that function in APIMonitor while looking for one setting and wanted to have something to see if I could replicate the behavior
2017-10-24T12:40:38 <javjarfer> mmm true, I haven\'t try with postmessage
2017-10-24T12:40:58 <javjarfer> do you think they could be exchangeable?
2017-10-24T12:41:01 <stegru> yes
2017-10-24T12:41:15 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-10-24T12:41:40 <stegru> postmessage doesn\'t wait for the response, sendmessagenotify doesn\'t wait either.. unless the window is in the same thread
2017-10-24T12:41:49 <stegru> sendmessage always waits for the response
2017-10-24T12:41:56 * jhung joined the channel
2017-10-24T12:41:58 <stegru> they\'re all interchangeable
2017-10-24T12:42:35 <stegru> if you want to see what messages are being sent, use Spy++ that comes with VS
2017-10-24T12:44:42 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-10-24T12:45:29 <stegru> what was the message, javjarfer ?
2017-10-24T12:50:57 <javjarfer> was an standard WM_SETTINGCHANGE directed to window 0x000000000000ffff
2017-10-24T12:51:00 <javjarfer> stegru,
2017-10-24T12:51:11 <stegru> ah ok
2017-10-24T12:51:46 <javjarfer> with your previous explanation, I guess that they are exchangeable, so I will try with that an see if that does the trick

2017-10-24T13:05:00 <kasparnet> Hello Antwarnique Bosmon
2017-10-24T13:06:02 <kasparnet> Looking at the passing of preference changes in the pzp
2017-10-24T13:06:06 <Bosmon> hi
2017-10-24T13:06:24 <kasparnet> I talked to georgitodorov on IRC who gave me this example of a preference change:
2017-10-24T13:06:25 <kasparnet> {"path":["preferences","http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/magnification"],"type":"ADD","value":2.25}
2017-10-24T13:06:42 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-10-24T13:06:45 <kasparnet> but that doesn\'t quite fit the model of the flowmanager.pcpChannel.model
2017-10-24T13:07:31 <kasparnet> rather it\'d have to be something like: {"path":["settingControls","http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/magnification", "value"],"type":"ADD","value":2.25}
2017-10-24T13:07:43 <kasparnet> or something along those lines
2017-10-24T13:08:13 <kasparnet> i.e. it screws up the model of the PCP client, the current payload

2017-10-24T13:17:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m lining up behind kasper to talk to you  :)
2017-10-24T13:22:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet_ - yes, we need to fix up the incoming signal a bit
2017-10-24T13:23:46 <kasparnet_> Bosmon, as in the pzp should be sending a different payload, or that I should do some juggling in the pcpchannel to modify the payload before it gets applied to the model?
2017-10-24T13:23:57 * kasparnet_ is crossing fingers it\'s the first option
2017-10-24T13:24:04 * kasparnet_ is now known as kasparnet
2017-10-24T13:31:01 <Bosmon> kasparnet - juggling for now, since we mean this to work
2017-10-24T13:31:07 <Bosmon> But it\'s just 1 or 2 lines of code either way
2017-10-24T13:33:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m lining up behind kasparnet and Justin_o to talk to you :)
2017-10-24T13:33:25 <Bosmon> I\'m also in a meeting
2017-10-24T13:33:27 <kasparnet> haha
2017-10-24T13:33:30 <Bosmon> So you are all behind Philip : P
2017-10-24T13:34:22 <cindyli> as long as we are in the line, no complaint ;)
2017-10-24T13:34:47 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-10-24T13:35:44 <kasparnet> Bosmon, so in that case, I\'m not sure I see much sense in applying it to the pcpChannel model in the first place.... Wouldn\'t it make more sense to handle it "directly" - i.e. applying it ot the session and have the sessionToPCP automagically triggered and taking care of updating the pcpClients model?

2017-10-24T14:02:38 <kasparnet> Bosmon, I guess this also holds for the context thing
2017-10-24T14:03:31 <kasparnet> is there a reason to update the PCP model, or would it be cleaner/more sensible to just apply the new context/preference via the framework as usual, and then have the sessionToPCP function taking care of updating the model
2017-10-24T14:04:15 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, it would just be sleazy not to update it : P
2017-10-24T14:04:27 * jhung1 joined the channel
2017-10-24T14:04:50 * jhung has quit
2017-10-24T14:06:26 <kasparnet> well, but also a bit misleading to update it, since the "real" final model will be generated from the sessionToPCP function afterwards

2017-10-24T14:06:55 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-10-24T14:07:35 <kasparnet> anyway, where would you suggest that i put my payload juggling
2017-10-24T14:07:36 <kasparnet> if it has to happen before applying it to the model
2017-10-24T14:07:58 <kasparnet> I guess it would have to be somewhere in the pcpChannel.receiveMessage function
2017-10-24T14:20:08 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-10-24T14:23:49 <Bosmon> kasparnet - which payload juggling in particular?
2017-10-24T14:27:16 <kasparnet> the one mentioned earlier
2017-10-24T14:27:32 <kasparnet> so I\'m getting this payload: {"path":["preferences","http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/magnification"],"type":"ADD","value":2.25}
2017-10-24T14:27:44 <kasparnet> and two things should happen with this:
2017-10-24T14:28:07 <kasparnet> I should create an NP style payload for the mini MM
2017-10-24T14:28:12 <kasparnet> and the model should be updated
2017-10-24T14:28:30 <kasparnet> and it currently matches neither
2017-10-24T14:28:36 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, yes
2017-10-24T14:28:41 <Bosmon> Well it VERY NEARLY matches both :)
2017-10-24T14:28:53 <Bosmon> But yes, you should jigger it so it applies to the local model first
2017-10-24T14:29:02 <Bosmon> And then write a relay rule that takes whatever you want out of that
2017-10-24T14:29:07 <Bosmon> Or listener, etc.
2017-10-24T14:30:41 <kasparnet> ok gotcha
