2017-06-12T21:13:38 <michelled> jhernandez: note that it changes to use a version of Kasper's windows repo - I'm not certain if his work has made it to master or not - we should check in with him

2017-06-12T16:13:39 <colinclark> clown, michelled: Have you read this? https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/privacy-security.html
2017-06-12T16:14:54 <clown> colinclark:  it looks vaguely familiar.  I may have skimmed it as part of the aria work.
2017-06-12T16:15:30 <colinclark> Some of the "challenges" here seem like they would convert naturally into "risks"
2017-06-12T16:15:40 <colinclark> in case it\'s useful for your current document
2017-06-12T16:18:02 <clown> colinclark:  thanks!  It fits with our "Risk of Not Understanding Privacy Issues" sub-section.
2017-06-12T16:18:07 <colinclark> yup
2017-06-12T16:18:21 <colinclark> at very least, it could be a good citation to support your identification of the risk
2017-06-12T16:19:00 <clown> how official is this document?  That is, is there a more official one.  *looks*
2017-06-12T16:19:10 <colinclark> I don\'t know, to be honest
2017-06-12T16:20:03 <clown> it\'s probably part of this repo:  https://github.com/w3c/coga
2017-06-12T16:20:10 <colinclark> yup, that sounds right
2017-06-12T16:20:58 <clown> interesting;  that repo has a branch named "StevaALee-patch-1"
2017-06-12T16:21:16 <colinclark> yes, slim was quite involved in the working group

2017-06-12T16:23:16 <colinclark> that was quick!
2017-06-12T16:23:18 <jhernandez> yes
2017-06-12T16:23:34 <stegru> sandra was deeply offended that you left without saying bye
2017-06-12T16:23:43 <michelled> oh no!!!!!!
2017-06-12T16:23:46 <michelled> hehe
2017-06-12T16:24:11 <jhernandez> hhahaha
2017-06-12T16:24:24 <jhernandez> michelled: don\'t feed the stegru :P
2017-06-12T16:24:32 <michelled> hahaha
2017-06-12T16:25:02 <stegru> to be honest, no one even noticed you go
2017-06-12T16:25:50 <jhernandez> that\'s true
2017-06-12T16:26:22 <clown> what\'s worse:  deep offence of invisbility?

2017-06-12T20:18:20 <simonjb> I\'m wondering about documentation, which page do you think docs for this function should go on?
2017-06-12T20:18:58 <simonjb> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html maybe? or http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ChangeApplierAPI.html
