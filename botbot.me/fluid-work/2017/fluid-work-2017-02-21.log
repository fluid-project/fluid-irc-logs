2017-02-21T10:14:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, morning!
2017-02-21T10:29:10 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2017-02-21T10:29:23 <Bosmon> Oldest trick in the book, that
2017-02-21T10:30:26 <kasparnet> ... and yet you fall for it almost every time
2017-02-21T10:30:42 <kasparnet> So I\'m still on my matchmaker testing
2017-02-21T10:31:19 <kasparnet> and I need to differentiate the behavior between acceptance tests and integration tests
2017-02-21T10:32:04 <kasparnet> ... since in the integration tests, I want to define some of the settings ahead of time and explicitl
2017-02-21T10:32:06 <kasparnet> y*
2017-02-21T10:32:18 <kasparnet> (namely that applications are not running)
2017-02-21T10:32:40 <kasparnet> whereas with the acceptance tests, I want the system to truly check whether applications are running
2017-02-21T10:33:22 <kasparnet> ... my first approach has been checking the rootGrade when constructing the test (in buildSingleTestFixture function of Testing.js)
2017-02-21T10:33:29 <kasparnet> but it seems pretty hacky
2017-02-21T10:33:53 <kasparnet> but I\'m not sure if there is a better way of doing the differentiation

2017-02-21T11:46:14 <Bosmon> The way you should be doing this is writing contextAwareness blocks sensing context grades, for example ones such as this one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/index.js#L44
2017-02-21T11:46:26 <Bosmon> You might want to create a further context which distinguishes these situations
2017-02-21T11:47:01 <Bosmon> You can see a sample use of this technique here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/journal/src/SettingsDir.js#L24
2017-02-21T11:47:57 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - since you are alive again, perhaps you could look at this small pull for me: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/505
2017-02-21T11:48:32 <kasparne_> awesome, thanks bosmon
2017-02-21T11:48:37 <kasparne_> and will review the pull
2017-02-21T12:32:40 <jhernandez> Bosmon: buenos dias
2017-02-21T12:33:10 <jhernandez> could you please do a quick review to https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/112
2017-02-21T12:34:14 <jhernandez> it\'s about our problems with non-valid screen resolutions
2017-02-21T12:34:56 <jhernandez> I guess that it\'s fine for HST and that it would need some more love before landing master
2017-02-21T12:35:05 <jhernandez> thanks in advance

2017-02-21T16:21:15 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I am thinking/suspecting that we might need to undo a part of the work we did for FLUID-5821
2017-02-21T16:21:41 <Bosmon> It\'s either that or break some other APIs we\'re committed to, or go through some annoying kind of "replacement plus deprecation cycle"
2017-02-21T16:21:53 <Bosmon> The problem I\'m trying to solve is this one: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6132
2017-02-21T16:21:56 * sirdancealot joined the channel
2017-02-21T16:22:25 <Bosmon> I think I don\'t agree with the preferred resolution I just wrote there, and would prefer to continue that everyone can refer to the DOM binder as "that.dom" and "{that}.dom"
2017-02-21T16:22:39 <Bosmon> But it means altering the behaviour when resolving a selector which is not listed in the DOM binder at all
2017-02-21T16:23:06 <Bosmon> We will continue to resolve a selector of "" to the container, but a completely nonexistent selector will now resolve to "undefined" rather than a 0-element jQuery
2017-02-21T16:23:11 <Bosmon> Do you think that seems reasonable?

2017-02-21T16:49:31 <colinclark> I hit a case recently where I had a view component doing crazy things because I had a typo in my selector name
2017-02-21T16:49:38 * sirdancealot has quit

2017-02-21T17:13:52 <aashay> cindyli: in the commit message, in the first line, should i write what i have changed or what the bug was?
2017-02-21T17:14:41 <cindyli> aashay: u don\'t need to write what the bug was because the JIRA number attached with each commit msg already tells that
2017-02-21T17:14:58 <cindyli> just a short description of the goal of that commit
2017-02-21T17:16:36 <aashay> oh okay. i misinterpreted the wiki page then. i\'ll edit that and commit.
