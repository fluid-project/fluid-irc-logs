b'2017-11-25T21:12:31 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2017-11-25T21:12:32 <chlorophilia> hahahaah
2017-11-25T21:13:20 <chlorophilia> Ok i will send you my NSERC proposal\xe2\x80\xa6 and I will send you my CV as well. I mention our collaboration in it. However I think that it could be rephrased to better put into perspective the potential behind your design work
2017-11-25T21:13:35 <chlorophilia> (it\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible, clunky, Canadian Common CV)
2017-11-25T21:13:54 <Bosmon> Well, let\'s see where we can go ....
2017-11-25T21:14:12 <Bosmon> He\'s now grabbing my hands off the keyboard
2017-11-25T21:14:37 <Bosmon> Although he doesn\'t count on my ability to type tolerably well one-handed
2017-11-25T21:16:35 * stegru joined the channel
2017-11-25T21:18:55 <Bosmon> Great
2017-11-25T21:18:58 <Bosmon> Just got your CV...
2017-11-25T21:19:01 <chlorophilia> Just sent it off
2017-11-25T21:20:00 <chlorophilia> NSERC loves words like \xe2\x80\x98innovative\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98scaleable\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98 collaborative\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98novel\xe2\x80\x99 etc
2017-11-25T21:20:26 <Bosmon> Oh yes, also we don\'t use the Google Sheets API :)
2017-11-25T21:20:36 <Bosmon> But I guess we might
2017-11-25T21:20:37 <chlorophilia> hahaha
2017-11-25T21:20:48 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit hard to know which direction we will go in
2017-11-25T21:21:16 <chlorophilia> well\xe2\x80\xa6 in the interests of open access, especially for the salishsea project, it might be good if folks could contribute through Google Sheets\xe2\x80\xa6 but i am open to investigating alternative databases
2017-11-25T21:24:52 <chlorophilia> so i added a couple new columns into my sheet. 1) independent identifiers (important for making comparisons between datasets); 2) URLs for associated photographs (not sure if it might be possible to integrate thumbnails into hover overs, maybe that would be too resource-draining)
2017-11-25T21:26:37 <chlorophilia> I also added subfamilies, which I regret having ommitted before due to taxonomic bias
2017-11-25T21:31:31 <Bosmon> Yes, identifiers will be great
2017-11-25T21:31:36 <Bosmon> And yes, we can do the thumbnails
2017-11-25T21:31:53 <chlorophilia> Wowwwwwww
2017-11-25T21:32:03 <chlorophilia> my head may explode at some point, word of warning
2017-11-25T21:32:08 <Bosmon> :)
2017-11-25T21:32:56 <chlorophilia> the vision for the future: a database and associated visualizations that allow the user to compare list data for different localities in the Salish Sea
2017-11-25T21:33:06 <Bosmon> I liked your idea of a silhouette for the intermediate taxa, giving a hint about what kind of creature it might be...
2017-11-25T21:33:14 <Bosmon> But for that we will need some dedicated design resources
2017-11-25T21:33:21 <chlorophilia> yes, I think it might be cool to collaboration with Dana on that
2017-11-25T21:33:26 <Bosmon> awesome :)
2017-11-25T21:33:40 <chlorophilia> Yes, I should really look into funding opportunities
2017-11-25T21:34:12 <chlorophilia> Please keep track of the work you commit as it can be allocated as in-kind on grant proposals
2017-11-25T21:34:33 <chlorophilia> Unfortunately i am an idiot when it comes to writing grants
2017-11-25T21:34:36 * sgithens has quit
2017-11-25T21:34:47 <chlorophilia> but I will try to make more alliances
2017-11-25T21:39:20 <Bosmon> I guess one possibility for visualisation might be to adapt our "fractional colours" scheme to localities rather than documentedness
2017-11-25T21:39:33 <Bosmon> A taxon which has equal representation in the two localities would show up as grey
2017-11-25T21:39:50 <Bosmon> And then perhaps show green or red if it was unbalanced towards one or the other
2017-11-25T21:40:13 * kasper joined the channel
2017-11-25T21:40:42 <Bosmon> And then the brightness of the colour could be used to track representation relative to some geographical baseline such as the Salish Sea as a whole .....
2017-11-25T21:41:45 <chlorophilia> right! it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful if you can thnk of the ways of best encoding this in the database  bottom-up
2017-11-25T21:42:10 <chlorophilia> because I am working with partners on developing a standardized template for the data
2017-11-25T21:42:30 <chlorophilia> of course that also means we are at a pivotal stage of commiting to architecture
2017-11-25T21:42:36 <chlorophilia> so lots to think about : /
2017-11-25T21:45:00 * kasper has quit
2017-11-25T21:47:15 <chlorophilia> Done \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99 : )
2017-11-25T21:47:27 <chlorophilia> now i must get back to work on my research proposal, like a diligent student !
2017-11-25T21:48:28 <Bosmon> A! B!
2017-11-25T21:48:31 <Bosmon> A BUZZING THING
2017-11-25T21:50:35 <Bosmon> Sadly the "B" section of that Blackadder episode doesn\'t seem to be online ....
2017-11-25T21:52:43 <Bosmon> chlorophilia - well, one of the main goals of the "overarching" project would be to make it easy to work with whatever means each individual community prefers to use to encode their data
2017-11-25T21:52:49 <Bosmon> So I wouldn\'t sweat that one too much
2017-11-25T21:53:08 <Bosmon> But certainly as a general practice having some kind of unique ID is a big plus since I just had to invent some anyway when ingesting the dataset
2017-11-25T21:53:53 <Bosmon> You can see them here in this "marmalised" version of your dataset : P

2017-11-25T00:26:10 <chlorophilia> No, I have just been caught up in an NSERC research proposal
2017-11-25T00:26:22 <chlorophilia> sorry to be remis. This is great!

2017-11-25T00:59:36 <Bosmon> How\'s it going
2017-11-25T01:01:07 <gmoss> Hi Bosmon! I\'ve checked out of the IDRC for the weekend, but I had a question to do with the IoC test framework and tasks/promises back to back. It can wait until Monday though :)
2017-11-25T01:01:27 <Bosmon> Yes
2017-11-25T01:01:36 <Bosmon> Hopefully tasks back to back work fine
2017-11-25T01:01:45 <Bosmon> Although there may be a bug
2017-11-25T01:01:56 <Bosmon> At least formally it is fine, unlike the case of listeners back to back
2017-11-25T01:07:54 <Bosmon> gmoss - was your question about more than whether it should work? : P
2017-11-25T01:15:09 <gmoss> Bosmon: in the case of two tasks back to back, it seemed not to execute the second one\'s callback. The first one would return and the sequence would end before the second promise would resolve (if I recall correctly).
2017-11-25T01:18:07 <Bosmon> gmoss - ok
2017-11-25T01:18:08 * sgithens has quit
2017-11-25T01:18:14 <Bosmon> Well, this feature is tested: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/IoCTestingTests.js#L441
2017-11-25T01:18:18 <Bosmon> So perhaps something else is going on
2017-11-25T01:25:57 <gmoss> Hmmm, interesting, yes maybe there\'s something else at play, I\'ll take a look on Monday. Thanks, Bosmon for you help!
2017-11-25T01:26:13 <Bosmon> gmoss - no worries, will be interesting to look into it
2017-11-25T01:27:25 <gmoss> If you find you\'d like to take a look in the meantime, it\'s in a pull request I\'ve been working on for fluid-couch-config, I\'ll try to find a link...
2017-11-25T01:30:19 <gmoss> I\'m on my mobile, so I can\'t highlight or see the line numbers, but this is the file in question https://github.com/BlueSlug/fluid-couch-config/blob/master/tests/js/couchConfigTests.js
2017-11-25T01:31:41 <gmoss> I\'ve added event listeners between my tasks to make sure the first task is resolved and execution of the callback finishes before proceeding to the second task
2017-11-25T01:31:49 <gmoss> I hope I\'m using the correct terminology

2017-11-25T18:04:19 <chlorophilia> just processing the Animalia now\xe2\x80\xa6.
2017-11-25T18:05:40 * kasper has quit
2017-11-25T18:14:21 <chlorophilia> I know you hesitated when I asked to grant credits on the website, but it would actually look fantastic to show the collaboration bosmon
2017-11-25T18:14:40 <chlorophilia> even if the visualization isn\xe2\x80\x99t up to perfection yet....

2017-11-25T20:44:04 <chlorophilia> heya
2017-11-25T20:44:07 <Bosmon> Actually there is no d3 : P
2017-11-25T20:44:14 <Bosmon> I reimplemented it all from scratch...
2017-11-25T20:44:34 <chlorophilia> oh wow! hahaha fantastic
2017-11-25T20:45:02 <chlorophilia> I\xe2\x80\x99ve added a couple new columns to the ledger...
2017-11-25T20:45:03 <Bosmon> Although now I got there I thought that on the one hand it might have been done with d3 after all
2017-11-25T20:45:06 <chlorophilia> including independent identifiers
2017-11-25T20:45:12 <Bosmon> But on the other hand I thought that we might want to do away with SVG completely
2017-11-25T20:45:25 <chlorophilia> I trust your instincts
2017-11-25T20:45:28 <Bosmon> In the meantime we are lodged at the crossroads like Burridan\'s ass
2017-11-25T20:45:34 <chlorophilia> hahahaha
2017-11-25T20:45:36 <Bosmon> And at least we have something to look at
2017-11-25T20:45:54 <chlorophilia> Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s splendid if you ask me
2017-11-25T20:45:59 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry I didn\'t get back to you about your pdf of policies
2017-11-25T20:46:05 <Bosmon> To some extent I was just stunned by it : P
2017-11-25T20:46:11 <chlorophilia> pdf\xe2\x80\xa6 ?
2017-11-25T20:46:16 <chlorophilia> you mean the work flow?
2017-11-25T20:46:18 <Bosmon> Yes, that
2017-11-25T20:46:23 <Bosmon> I\'ve been puzzling over it all week
2017-11-25T20:47:03 <chlorophilia> haha, yeah, there are a few omissions to consider as well. I was thinking a little bit about it. I think it might work if some parts were scripted step-wise, interrupted by a manual validation process
2017-11-25T20:47:43 <Bosmon> Your morning\'s work reminds me of that episode of Blackadder where they are visited by .... DOCKTOUR JOHNSON
2017-11-25T20:48:00 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if you grew up with this rather idiosyncratic piece of British comedy of the 80s : P
2017-11-25T20:48:05 <chlorophilia> the thing about it\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is fair for you to trouble-shoot it based on my sub-optimal dependence on Mac Numbers. I would sooner adapt to another system if you can think of alternative solutions
2017-11-25T20:48:06 <Bosmon> But I certainly did :)
2017-11-25T20:48:15 <Bosmon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSYiT2iG08
2017-11-25T20:48:46 <Bosmon> chlorophilia - well, for alternative systems we\'ll need something pretty grandiose to make an improvement on your current use of "whatever standard desktop spreadsheet you have to hand"
2017-11-25T20:49:14 <Bosmon> But yes, there will be room to make little patches and bits of duct tape to your workflow here and there
2017-11-25T20:49:26 <chlorophilia> OH GOSH hahaha HILARIOUS
2017-11-25T20:49:50 <Bosmon> Well this clip is a bit more dictionary-like :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmk4PfuiPVY
2017-11-25T20:51:31 <Bosmon> I was wondering whether you ran into this lot: https://datahub.io/
2017-11-25T20:52:43 <chlorophilia> No, but I think it is probably time I graduated to something a little more sophisticated...
2017-11-25T20:52:43 <Bosmon> Or relatedly this log: http://okfnlabs.org/
2017-11-25T20:52:57 <Bosmon> I think I saw they had a project in your area, let me shuffle through my history...
2017-11-25T20:53:04 <Bosmon> I think you might have mentioned this lot
2017-11-25T20:56:10 <Bosmon> Oh yes, then I found this thing, which in its way is quite remarkable: http://lifemap-ncbi.univ-lyon1.fr/
2017-11-25T20:56:23 <Bosmon> Although I then saw that it is just a gigantic pile of png images, probably terabytes of them : P
2017-11-25T20:57:12 <Bosmon> I love the hugeness of its sweep, and its incredible smoothness, and glowingness
2017-11-25T20:57:22 <Bosmon> But technologically it has very few community-building values
2017-11-25T20:57:31 <Bosmon> It must take them a day or so to do a rebuild whenever they get any new data : P
2017-11-25T20:58:12 <chlorophilia> oooooooooo
2017-11-25T20:58:17 <Bosmon> I was trying to figure out why the "Phoronis worm" was so orphaned in your dataset : P
2017-11-25T20:58:17 <chlorophilia> SOrry i was watching one of those clips
2017-11-25T20:58:36 <Bosmon> But it seems they are pretty peculiar things
2017-11-25T20:58:36 <Bosmon> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=115423
2017-11-25T20:59:25 <chlorophilia> Oooooo
2017-11-25T20:59:27 <chlorophilia> that\xe2\x80\x99s very nice
2017-11-25T21:00:01 <Bosmon> I\'d love to be able to build something like the French "lifemap" only i) fully dynamic, and ii) with a kind of "multi-authority" component
2017-11-25T21:00:03 <chlorophilia> some groups are very poorly represented...
2017-11-25T21:00:19 <Bosmon> That makes it easy to see the relationship and discrepancies between the taxonomies from the different authorities
2017-11-25T21:00:34 <Bosmon> Which as far as I can see from your PDF of workflow is a pretty big stumbling block in your everyday life
2017-11-25T21:01:13 <chlorophilia> oh hahaha, yes, well I can opt for the \xe2\x80\x98standard\xe2\x80\x99 authorities adopted by the iNat community.. the have a set of criteria for making those decisions. Though sometimes that is painful as I don\xe2\x80\x99t always agree...
2017-11-25T21:01:30 <chlorophilia> i protest by changing the names in my ledger
2017-11-25T21:01:31 <Bosmon> The lifemap already has exactly zero accessibility values anyway so we\'d be starting from a very low bar :)
2017-11-25T21:01:38 <chlorophilia> but yes\xe2\x80\xa6 that is truly awkward and difficult to track
2017-11-25T21:01:57 <Bosmon> Yes well, this is the whole point, isn\'t it.... I was hoping that this might be a venue for trying to solve these kinds of sociotechnical problems properly
2017-11-25T21:02:12 <Bosmon> Wikipedia finesses this issue by pushing all the arguments to local editors of individual pages
2017-11-25T21:02:26 <Bosmon> But this is manageable because there isn\'t any global impact of a lost or won local battle
2017-11-25T21:02:29 <chlorophilia> I think what you are proposing might be great for the bio galiano project\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps even better for a larger dataset, such as I hope to see housed at \'salishseabiodiversity.org\xe2\x80\x99
2017-11-25T21:02:46 <Bosmon> SALISHSEABIODIVERSITY!!!
2017-11-25T21:02:53 <chlorophilia> yes sir
2017-11-25T21:03:00 <chlorophilia> I registered the domain name
2017-11-25T21:03:04 <Bosmon> Fantastic
2017-11-25T21:03:22 <Bosmon> And I\'d love to hear some more about your NSERC proposal as well
2017-11-25T21:03:39 <chlorophilia> I have collaborators in Squamish and in Lantzville\xe2\x80\xa6 and potential partners in Whistler and Metchosin
2017-11-25T21:03:55 <chlorophilia> (the latter two places have had a long-standing tradition of bioblitzes)
2017-11-25T21:03:59 <Bosmon> I am doing well here keeping the BABBIE distracted by videos of UILS in the other window ....
2017-11-25T21:04:11 <chlorophilia> Ah, yes Dana told me about your babe! Congrats!
2017-11-25T21:04:11 <Bosmon> Every 5 minutes or so I have to find him another one :)
2017-11-25T21:04:24 <chlorophilia> I saw her art show yesterday
2017-11-25T21:04:29 <Bosmon> Oh great
2017-11-25T21:04:41 <Bosmon> It\'s so fantastic that you guys can hang out, on the ...... ISLLAND
2017-11-25T21:05:07 <chlorophilia> yes, at risk of becoming horribly insular.. and a bad driver
2017-11-25T21:07:25 <chlorophilia> the NSERC is just about done. Well, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s done I am just waiting on my referees
2017-11-25T21:07:50 <chlorophilia> Stoked I have the curator of entomology at the Royal BC Museum to write a letter of reference
2017-11-25T21:08:12 <Bosmon> :) :)
2017-11-25T21:08:19 <chlorophilia> I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy for your feedback on it. I could email it to you if you like
2017-11-25T21:08:22 <Bosmon> what will your project be?
