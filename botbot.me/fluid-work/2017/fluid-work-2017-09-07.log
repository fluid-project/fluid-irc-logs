2017-09-07T18:24:42 <jhernandez> :)
2017-09-07T18:24:47 <clown> \\o/
2017-09-07T18:25:22 <stegru> the problem was because it starts the metrics on an onCreate, that\'s why it buggered up when windows/index.js was being included
2017-09-07T18:25:32 <jhernandez> right
2017-09-07T18:26:07 <jhernandez> I could get rid of the problem by splitting the tests into two different files and run them in a row
2017-09-07T18:26:31 <stegru> i knew you could sort it out :)
2017-09-07T18:26:54 <jhernandez> clown: and looks like the JIRA I reported and assigned to you isn\'t relevant (now) - I will close it

2017-09-07T18:36:14 <jhernandez> michelled: I was going to ask you for a review but I see that you already commented on it
2017-09-07T18:36:30 <jhernandez> great!
2017-09-07T18:37:16 <jhernandez> and regarding your comment, yes, it does make sense
2017-09-07T18:37:18 <jhernandez> the question is, how?
2017-09-07T18:39:07 <jhernandez> I mean, is there any way to ensure that these tests run in sequence and provide a consolidated result?
2017-09-07T18:39:29 <michelled> I think this is a question for Bosmon
2017-09-07T18:39:48 <jhernandez> right
2017-09-07T18:40:55 <stegru> i know what he\'ll say
2017-09-07T18:41:02 <jhernandez> and actually answering to your question, no, we get two different consolidated results
2017-09-07T18:41:14 <jhernandez> :)

2017-09-07T19:00:40 <jhernandez> quick question, do you think that your work on that pull request will solve this problem?
2017-09-07T19:01:16 <jhernandez> that pull = https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/17
2017-09-07T19:04:51 <jhernandez> oh, now that I\'m looking at it, it looks like you\'re not running them (the windows and universal tests) yet
2017-09-07T19:05:30 <jhernandez> oh wait, they are
2017-09-07T19:06:27 <jhernandez> well, I guess it\'s a wip branch

2017-09-07T19:09:45 <michelled> jhernandez: the issues that I\'m having in that branch means I can\'t run the universal and windows tests along with the app integration tests
2017-09-07T19:09:54 <michelled> I doubt it\'s going to fix the issue you found though
2017-09-07T19:30:43 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-07T19:33:14 <Bosmon> Hey jhernandez
2017-09-07T19:33:21 <Bosmon> What\'s all this about "a consolidated result"? : P
2017-09-07T19:33:27 <Bosmon> This is how the tests are meant to ru nanyway
2017-09-07T19:34:40 <michelled> Bosmon: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2582
2017-09-07T19:35:47 <Bosmon> Yes, I see it
2017-09-07T19:35:49 * danayo has quit
2017-09-07T19:35:51 <Bosmon> But the report still isn\'t completely clear
2017-09-07T19:36:11 <Bosmon> "we found out that the universal eventLogger tests fail because the eventLogger is actually producing event logs that causes interference in the universal tests"
2017-09-07T19:36:20 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t explain in detail what is happening
2017-09-07T19:37:06 <michelled> I think stegru knows more details
2017-09-07T19:37:15 <Bosmon> I guess the problem is that the event logger doesn\'t have proper mocks?
2017-09-07T19:37:22 <stegru> that\'s right
2017-09-07T19:37:27 <Bosmon> ok
2017-09-07T19:37:40 <stegru> sorry, need to go the chippy.. i\'ve just put in a pr that might fix it for now
2017-09-07T19:37:46 <Bosmon> awesome
2017-09-07T19:37:49 <Bosmon> On both counts :)
2017-09-07T19:37:54 <Bosmon> I wish I could go to the chippy

2017-09-07T14:47:42 <stegru> jhung: I\'d like to make the installer run a script when it installs.. what do you think about that?
2017-09-07T14:47:53 <stegru> sorry I mean jhernandez not jhung
2017-09-07T14:49:16 * amatas joined the channel
2017-09-07T14:49:20 <jhernandez> what do I think?
2017-09-07T14:49:22 <jhernandez> it\'s fine
2017-09-07T14:49:24 <jhernandez> :)
2017-09-07T14:49:44 <jhernandez> I mean, are you asking about the feasibility of running things at installation time?
2017-09-07T14:50:02 <jhernandez> if so, yes, it\'s not a problem
2017-09-07T14:50:10 <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2017-09-07T14:50:48 <stegru> ok!
2017-09-07T14:51:04 <stegru> ^ jhernandez
2017-09-07T14:52:12 <stegru> what actually builds the installer... is it gpii-windows or gpii-app? each has Installer.ps1
2017-09-07T14:53:42 <stegru> it\'s ok, I used my own brain
2017-09-07T14:53:47 <jhernandez> haha
2017-09-07T14:54:03 <jhernandez> yes, there\'s an Installer.ps1 for both project
2017-09-07T14:54:06 <jhernandez> *projects
2017-09-07T14:54:08 <stegru> how come windows has one?
2017-09-07T14:54:25 <jhernandez> it exists before the gpii-app one
2017-09-07T14:54:39 <stegru> ah makes sense
2017-09-07T14:54:41 <jhernandez> and yeah, we can either deliver the gpii-windows or gpii-app
2017-09-07T14:55:07 <stegru> so, if i had to change anything.. both need to be updated?
2017-09-07T14:55:27 <jhernandez> that\'s why they both have an Installer.ps1 included
2017-09-07T14:55:51 <jhernandez> what kind of change?
2017-09-07T14:55:58 <stegru> i don\'t know
2017-09-07T14:56:09 <jhernandez> most of the installation creation logic is in gpii-wix-installer
2017-09-07T14:56:26 * alanharnum2 joined the channel
2017-09-07T14:56:44 <jhernandez> and in Installer.ps1 we set up everything to actually build the installer using gpii-wix-installer
2017-09-07T14:56:48 <jhernandez> gotcha?
2017-09-07T14:56:50 <stegru> yep
2017-09-07T14:57:05 <stegru> and the script just moves things around, so it gets put into the installer
2017-09-07T14:57:12 <stegru> and builds
2017-09-07T14:57:35 <jhernandez> exacto
2017-09-07T14:57:38 <jhernandez> amigo

2017-09-07T15:01:15 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-09-07T15:02:06 <jhernandez> in any case, if you want to run something at the end of the installation, we\'re already doing so to automatically start the listeners and the gpii
2017-09-07T15:02:39 <stegru> yes, i was just looking at that line

2017-09-07T15:10:51 <stegru> jhernandez: let\'s say I have a "run-once.js", which is only ran after install - where do you think it should go.. gpii-wix-installer or gpii-app?
2017-09-07T15:11:58 * danayo joined the channel
2017-09-07T15:14:23 <jhernandez> if it\'s static, gpii-wix-installer
2017-09-07T15:15:26 <stegru> what would it be if it wasn\'t static?
2017-09-07T15:15:39 <stegru> i mean... what do you mean by "static"?
2017-09-07T15:16:22 <jhernandez> well, by static I mean something that is going to be ship always in the same form, that doesn\'t depend if we\'re on windows or gpii-app
2017-09-07T15:16:42 <jhernandez> and that is not going to receive a lot of updates

2017-09-07T17:35:35 * clown as if that helps.

2017-09-07T18:04:07 <amatas> hi ussjoin, well, they are not strict secrets. I\'m talking about IP address, routes, users, password hashes
2017-09-07T18:04:29 <ussjoin> amatas: Ah yeah---so can we avoid checking that into source control at all?
2017-09-07T18:05:06 * alanharnum2 joined the channel
2017-09-07T18:05:48 <amatas> I think that is not an easy task, and it will require some time. At least all the variables that Ansible use, because I guess that we would have to change some code of the roles that we use.
2017-09-07T18:05:52 * dandimitrov has quit
2017-09-07T18:06:31 <ussjoin> amatas: Those variables have to be in source control, or they just have to be available to Ansible?
2017-09-07T18:06:32 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-09-07T18:07:58 <amatas> most of them are in the inventory and group variables files
2017-09-07T18:08:52 <amatas> but I\'d like to go over all the playbooks and check that are clean of those variables
2017-09-07T18:09:03 <jhernandez> stegru: when running the filebeat installer, I have to close the window instead of "pressing any key to continue"?
2017-09-07T18:09:17 <jhernandez> what if I press A key?
2017-09-07T18:09:36 <amatas> you have to press the any key
2017-09-07T18:09:38 <stegru> javi, i was talking about the thing that Han uses
2017-09-07T18:10:15 <stegru> you can do what you want with the filebeat installer... it just asks to press a key in case there\'s an error message
2017-09-07T18:10:23 <jhernandez> haha
2017-09-07T18:10:25 <jhernandez> okay

2017-09-07T18:20:02 <stegru> https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/75/console
2017-09-07T18:20:09 <stegru> no hanging
2017-09-07T18:20:42 <michelled> ah, ok
2017-09-07T18:21:03 <jhernandez> stegru: yeeah, it is, running tests
2017-09-07T18:21:39 <jhernandez> this time, they\'re actually running
2017-09-07T18:21:40 <stegru> isn\'t it the same tests as windows and universal? because they don\'t take as long
2017-09-07T18:21:57 <michelled> yes, it\'s the same ones
2017-09-07T18:22:02 <jhernandez> it runs universal all tests and windows unit tests
2017-09-07T18:22:33 <stegru> a watched pot never boils
2017-09-07T18:22:41 <michelled> haha, true that
2017-09-07T18:23:57 <stegru> nice one, they passed
2017-09-07T18:24:09 <jhernandez> stegru: hahaha

2017-09-07T09:51:52 <stegru> hi
2017-09-07T09:52:42 <stegru> what have i broke now?
2017-09-07T09:53:08 <jhernandez> xDD
2017-09-07T09:53:24 <jhernandez> gpii-app tests
2017-09-07T09:53:28 <jhernandez> https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/72/consoleFull
2017-09-07T09:54:19 <stegru> ah
2017-09-07T09:54:20 <jhernandez> the universal eventLog tests are failing both here locally and on CI
2017-09-07T10:03:37 <stegru> works ok for me, jhernandez. are you using master for universal?
2017-09-07T10:03:41 <Bosmon> Morning georgitodorov
2017-09-07T10:03:46 <Bosmon> dandimitrov
2017-09-07T10:03:56 <jhernandez> stegru: yes, but on electron
2017-09-07T10:04:17 <Bosmon> Would you like to have a session going over your code so far?
2017-09-07T10:04:54 <jhernandez> stegru: on node they run fine, the problem comes when running them on electron
2017-09-07T10:05:48 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I saw your update from yesterday night on the PCP API - great job!!
2017-09-07T10:06:06 <stegru> I have an idea why.. the real metrics are being captured, while the tests are running.. causing real data to be also sent to the log
2017-09-07T10:07:54 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-09-07T10:11:55 * amatas_ joined the channel
2017-09-07T10:13:56 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hello, Antranig! Yes, having such a session sounds great. How do you image that we do it?
2017-09-07T10:14:46 <georgitodorov> Sorry for the typo - I meant, how shall we do it?
2017-09-07T10:17:11 <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, that was my impression, but why is that it only happens on gpii-app?
2017-09-07T10:18:06 <jhernandez> oh, and btw, the metrics are working - just checked with amatas in Kibana
2017-09-07T10:19:35 <stegru> good
2017-09-07T10:19:41 <jhernandez> very good
2017-09-07T10:25:40 <stegru> can\'t even get these stupid tests to work
2017-09-07T10:26:08 <stegru> can you remove require("gpii-windows/index.js"); from tests.js and see what happens for me?
2017-09-07T10:27:13 <stegru> because, when the tests are ran without gpii-app, that file isn\'t required
2017-09-07T10:30:41 <jhernandez> mmm
2017-09-07T10:30:50 <jhernandez> let me check what happens
2017-09-07T10:32:37 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - well, we could have a session over Skype, perhaps with some screensharing
2017-09-07T10:32:39 <stegru> this is the branch? javihernandez/GPII-2084
2017-09-07T10:34:03 <jhernandez> stegru: right
2017-09-07T10:34:32 <jhernandez> mmm, I\'m also getting random failures from the process reporter tests
2017-09-07T10:35:15 <jhernandez> let me restart the machine, yesterday night they were passing
2017-09-07T10:40:27 <gloob> you shall not pass
2017-09-07T10:40:47 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Do you want us to send you some pieces of code to look at them before having a call?
2017-09-07T10:40:54 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - sure
2017-09-07T10:40:56 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-07T10:41:06 <Bosmon> We should start a running pull in github for our comments
2017-09-07T10:41:10 <Bosmon> We often do this with other work
2017-09-07T10:41:21 <Bosmon> Even if code is not ready to be merged, it can be useful to have a pull request as a focus for it
2017-09-07T10:41:31 <Bosmon> For example, my own pull request on universal :)
2017-09-07T10:41:42 <gloob> jhernandez: the eventlog was failing in my branch too
2017-09-07T10:41:55 <georgitodorov> Bosomon: Great, we will prepare the PR and will send it to you shortly
2017-09-07T10:42:11 <georgitodorov> Any comments you have will be greatly appreciated.
2017-09-07T10:42:13 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - awesome!
2017-09-07T10:42:16 <Bosmon> See you in a bit
2017-09-07T10:44:49 <jhernandez> gloob: how come? under what situation? using windows or gpii-app?
2017-09-07T10:48:04 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-07T10:48:20 <dandimitrov> Hello everyone! We are having trouble running the `gpii-app` with the newest version of the `gpii-windows` module - it gives an error upon start: ```...The grade hierarchy of component with type gpii.processes.windows is incomplete - it inherits from the following grade(s): gpii.processes for which the grade definitions are corrupt or missing...```
2017-09-07T10:48:23 <dandimitrov> We found that `gpii.pocesses.windows` component is defined in `gpii-windows/gpii/node_module/ProcessReporter.js`, however we couldn\'t find a definition for the `gpii.processes` component anywhere in the `gpii-windows` (including the dependencies).
2017-09-07T10:48:23 <dandimitrov> Has someone encountered such an error before?
2017-09-07T10:48:30 <stegru> ok when I remove the gpii-windows/index.js include, metrics passes
2017-09-07T10:49:27 <jhernandez> stegru: yup, tests just finished here
2017-09-07T10:50:41 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: which version of gpii-app are you using?
2017-09-07T10:52:15 <stegru> so it\'s wokring now?
2017-09-07T10:55:13 <dandimitrov> jhernandez: We are using this one: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/commits/add/pcp_channel_communication
2017-09-07T10:56:54 <stegru> dandimitrov: that points to your hst-2017 branch of windows, which is 12 commits behind
2017-09-07T10:57:10 <stegru> "gpii-windows": "git://github.com/danailbd/windows.git#hst-2017",
2017-09-07T10:58:40 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: right, that\'s because windows/hst-2017 has been updated recently and the changes are not in gpii-app yet
2017-09-07T11:00:43 <dandimitrov> stegru: We wanted to use the draft version of the PCP API that Bosmon supplied us with
2017-09-07T11:01:22 <gloob> jhernandez: windows
2017-09-07T11:01:48 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-09-07T11:02:36 <dandimitrov> jhernandez: We saw you have a PR to the gpii-app, adding `electron-egde` as dependency and did so locally - are there any more changes we are missing?
2017-09-07T11:05:08 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: nope, just the thing that windows/hst-2017 is not pointing to Bosmon\'s PCP API branch of universal
2017-09-07T11:05:51 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: after the update, have you deleted node_modules and ran npm install again?
2017-09-07T11:07:27 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: and yeah, your windows/hst-2017 branch must be updated too
2017-09-07T11:08:39 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - you are going to have to make your own branches of all the relevant projects, sorry that everything is in a bit of flux at the moment
2017-09-07T11:08:55 <dandimitrov> jhernandez: Thank you I\'ll have these checked and yes we tried deleting the node_modules folder
2017-09-07T11:09:32 <Bosmon> You might need to back up your windows branch to the last one which was good for gpii-app
2017-09-07T11:10:37 <jhernandez> yes, that what I was going to suggest dandimitrov, you can just stick to the version of windows that works for your gpii-app
2017-09-07T11:11:51 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Ok, we\'ll fallback to that version
2017-09-07T11:15:13 <dandimitrov> And just to clarify things, my main idea for the gpii-windows fork was to use Bosmon\'s PCP API branch as universal dependency in order to have a simpler way of supplying it to our dev gpii-app
2017-09-07T11:15:25 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes, that should work
2017-09-07T11:15:45 <Bosmon> In general it is ok for the more dependent projects to be newer than the ones that depend on them
2017-09-07T11:16:08 <Bosmon> But gpii-app itself is the focus of a lot of tangle currently
2017-09-07T11:17:56 <Bosmon> If you take branches of windows and gpii-app at your "last known good" configuration, and then just update your universal to my branch, you should be fine

2017-09-07T11:29:36 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Thank you, we\'ll try downgrading the windows dependency
2017-09-07T11:37:20 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: A quick question - I am struggling a bit with the "Selection to inputs" expander. What I am trying to achieve is to pass dynamically the ID of the selection. I am using something like `selectionID: "{that}.attrs.name"`. However, the IoC reference is not interpreted. Is there a support in the infusion framework for dynamic selectIDs?
2017-09-07T11:39:24 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - it\'s odd you say this, since Justin_o just implemented this last month
2017-09-07T11:39:25 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/RendererUtilities.js#L312
2017-09-07T11:39:35 <Bosmon> It should be enough for you to update to the most recent infusion dev release
2017-09-07T11:40:29 <Bosmon> So the dev release in my branch was from 3 days after this commit
2017-09-07T11:40:34 <Bosmon> So in theory it should be there
2017-09-07T11:40:56 <Bosmon> Your gpii-app may have an older dependency - it is something to check when you make your branches
2017-09-07T11:41:10 <Bosmon> Anything after 3.0.0-dev.20170727T125648Z.47055ca should be fine
