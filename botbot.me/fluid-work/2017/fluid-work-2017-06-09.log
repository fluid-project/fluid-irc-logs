2017-06-09T15:27:55 <jhung> Bosmon: I have a random question for you which is related to PhET work we\'re doing. Do you know if there\'s a way to programmatically create "plain English" text descriptions of line graphs? Does such a tool exist?
2017-06-09T15:27:55 <alanharnum> I won\'t be at standup - in a meeting around the corner from the office
2017-06-09T15:28:33 <jhung> For example we\'d like to describe something like this Bosmon:  https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Energy+Skatepark+Free+Form+Track+Construction?preview=/140902447/140902449/Track-Desctipion-08.png
2017-06-09T15:30:34 <jhung> fluid-everyone, Justin_o, Caren and I are in a PhET meeting and won\'t be able to join Stand-up today.
2017-06-09T15:30:57 <clown> thanks jhung.
2017-06-09T15:31:07 <danayo> and Jess_, alanharnum and I are tied up in SJRK meeting
2017-06-09T15:31:43 <clown> Only lisa and I are in the office.
2017-06-09T15:32:46 <clown> I will join the flud_standup just to see who else comes.
