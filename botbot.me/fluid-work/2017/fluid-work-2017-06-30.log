2017-06-30T11:33:26 <stegru> hi amatas

2017-06-30T11:35:17 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-06-30T11:35:22 <amatas> hi stegru
2017-06-30T11:35:40 <stegru> do you know if there\'s a limit for the log entries?
2017-06-30T11:35:48 <stegru> i mean, a length
2017-06-30T11:35:59 <amatas> there isn\'t a limit
2017-06-30T11:36:18 <stegru> so I could have a 10GB line? ;)
2017-06-30T11:36:39 <amatas> well, it is possible but it will affect to the performance I guess
2017-06-30T11:36:55 <amatas> why are you asking this?
2017-06-30T11:37:01 <stegru> ok, it\'s just for the key timings
2017-06-30T11:37:46 <amatas> does it demands a very big size lines?
2017-06-30T11:38:25 <stegru> oh no, not at all - just wondering if there was some sort of limit to how long an entry can be
2017-06-30T11:39:14 <stegru> if someone tpyes one key per second for an hour, it would be 3600 items in the entry
2017-06-30T11:39:24 <amatas> I think that the only limit that we have is the total size of the datastorage of the Elasticsearch
2017-06-30T11:40:08 <amatas> mmm but I understanded in the description of the metric that they are only interested on some keys
2017-06-30T11:40:20 <amatas> backspace, arrows, delete...
2017-06-30T11:40:27 <stegru> yes, but there will be the times for the other keys
2017-06-30T11:40:27 <amatas> am I wrong?
2017-06-30T11:40:33 <stegru> no
2017-06-30T11:40:36 <amatas> oh
2017-06-30T11:41:15 <stegru> "To include the time down for each letter key and space bar -- but the key identity for only  ESC,  BACKSPACE, DELETE"
2017-06-30T11:41:15 * kasparnet has quit
2017-06-30T11:41:20 <amatas> ok, so if we can remove the times for the other keys the size of the log entry would be reduced considerably
2017-06-30T11:41:53 <amatas> mm
2017-06-30T11:42:16 <stegru> no, the time for every key is logged (just not the value of the key, unless it\'s esc, bs, del )
2017-06-30T11:42:58 <stegru> the point of this is to see if certain changes to the user\'s preferences have improved their typing
2017-06-30T11:43:11 <amatas> the thing is that they wanted to know when a user tries to correct a text typed
2017-06-30T11:43:21 <stegru> and that
2017-06-30T11:46:01 <amatas> anyway it\'s too much data to store
2017-06-30T11:46:26 <amatas> also I think that it\'s not easy to compute to get the metric
2017-06-30T11:46:37 <stegru> ye
2017-06-30T11:47:00 <amatas> perhaps we should discuss it (again) at the metrics meeting
2017-06-30T11:47:11 <stegru> i think so too
2017-06-30T11:47:25 <amatas> sending the statistic instead of all the keystrokes, for example
2017-06-30T11:47:54 <stegru> exactly
2017-06-30T11:49:18 <amatas> ok, I\'ll send an email with this info, could you comment the issue with your progress and a brief explanation of the data that needs to be exported to address the keystroke info?
2017-06-30T11:49:44 <stegru> yep
2017-06-30T11:49:47 <amatas> thanks
2017-06-30T11:50:03 <stegru> implementing it is fine... i\'ve already done it
2017-06-30T11:50:37 <amatas> yep but it seems that it isn\'t usable
2017-06-30T11:50:53 <stegru> i agree
2017-06-30T12:14:51 <gtirloni> are we working on a key logger? :)
2017-06-30T12:15:11 <gtirloni> maybe we could log only the statics for a period of time
2017-06-30T12:15:15 <gtirloni> statistics
2017-06-30T12:22:31 <amatas> gtirloni: that seems to be the most reasonable idea
2017-06-30T12:23:21 <amatas> and yes, it seems a key logger :D, but it logs only a few identified keys
2017-06-30T12:24:09 <gtirloni> reminds me of this recent news: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/keylogger-found-in-audio-driver-of-hp-laptops/
2017-06-30T12:24:28 <gtirloni> (all points to non-malicious intent, used for debugging)
2017-06-30T12:25:04 <gtirloni> i was thinking if we could log a single message with the keys of interest, and their average times.. could that fit the business requirements maybe?

2017-06-30T12:52:34 <stegru> they basically want the time between each key press (not the actual key, except bs/del).. it\'s to see if preferences changes have improved speed/accuracy.
2017-06-30T12:53:11 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-06-30T12:53:23 <gtirloni> ah, got it, makes sense
2017-06-30T12:54:42 <stegru> but yes, it\'s better to send "typing speed" and "accuracy" value, rather than the raw data
2017-06-30T12:57:04 <stegru> amatas, I think it would be ok to send the raw data to the cloud for now (during pilots), then once the algorithms are working put them into the client
2017-06-30T12:58:16 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-06-30T13:16:08 <amatas> stegru: let me check your last changes. I\'ll see if I can get the statistics using the aggregations that Kibana allows
2017-06-30T13:17:36 <stegru> by the way, I\'ve pushed something that I haven\'t ran yet
2017-06-30T13:24:13 <amatas> mmmm
2017-06-30T13:25:00 <amatas> so ... something like this can happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjBegA5t1L4
2017-06-30T13:34:32 <stegru> haha!
2017-06-30T15:19:13 <gtirloni> lol, that\'s awesome
