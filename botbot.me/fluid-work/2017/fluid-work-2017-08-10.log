b"2017-08-10T17:10:52 <Justin_o> grrrero: the numbers are sequential in terms of creation date
2017-08-10T17:11:00 <Justin_o> grrrero: did you get something strange back?
2017-08-10T17:12:27 <gtirloni_> Justin_o: no, not using vagrant here. i have node installed and just did `npm install` and `npm start` (with the env vars)
2017-08-10T17:14:05 <gtirloni_> i'm spinning up a vagrant vm to see if I can reproduce the error
2017-08-10T17:20:26 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: if you are using vagrant you'll also need to modify the vars.yml file to just use npm install
2017-08-10T17:20:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-10T17:20:55 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: also for your setup did you have ENV variables set for all of the values in the config
2017-08-10T17:20:55 <Justin_o> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/config/environment.json
2017-08-10T17:24:15 <gtirloni_> Justin_o: i was missing a few because i used the ones in the readme, but it seems that after adding a few of them from that config file I still get this error:
2017-08-10T17:24:17 <gtirloni_> Error in assembleCreatorArguments: cannot look up component type name gpii.firstDiscovery.server.preferences.router to a component creator grade with an argumentMap
2017-08-10T17:24:26 <gtirloni_> Justin_o: is it working for you outside vagrant?
2017-08-10T17:24:49 <Justin_o> that's the error i'm getting in vagrant
2017-08-10T17:25:02 <grrrero> Justin_o: This look ok? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6185
2017-08-10T17:25:20 <gtirloni_> i'm getting that error outside vagrant, vagrant is a red herring here
2017-08-10T17:26:02 <Justin_o> grrrero: well the one for fonts you were adding now, so no need to deprecate those. You can just remove them. Also you should probably mention specifically which functions in Themes.styl are deprecated
2017-08-10T17:26:19 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: yep, at least we're at the same point now :)
2017-08-10T17:26:24 <gtirloni_> :)
2017-08-10T17:26:36 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: and that's further than you got before, you are getting past the data.port error right?
2017-08-10T17:26:43 <gtirloni_> yep
2017-08-10T17:26:51 <Justin_o> yah, :) okay making progress
2017-08-10T17:26:55 <gtirloni_> after I specified FIRST_DISCOVERY_SERVER_TCP_PORT=9999
2017-08-10T17:27:19 <Justin_o> i'm guessing this issue maybe related to changes in kettle and/or infusion
2017-08-10T17:28:13 <grrrero> Justin_o: Updated it
2017-08-10T17:29:39 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-08-10T17:31:38 <Justin_o> grrrero: i made some modifications to the JIRA
2017-08-10T17:32:12 <Justin_o> also you can remove the use of those deprecated methods. That is from the Stylus files for PrefsEditor, SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor, SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame
2017-08-10T17:32:31 <Justin_o> however you should only deprecate the function definitions in Themes.style
2017-08-10T17:32:37 <Justin_o> grrrero: ^
2017-08-10T17:33:18 <grrrero> Yep I removed them
2017-08-10T17:33:26 <grrrero> Justin_o ^
2017-08-10T17:33:32 <Justin_o> cool
2017-08-10T17:36:11 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: i think this grade ( gpii.express.contentAware.router ) may no longer exist in gpii-express
2017-08-10T17:36:16 <Justin_o> trying to investigate
2017-08-10T17:41:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: okay, got it working with vagrant at least. I'll file a PR with the changes we discussed here and to the grade name i mentioned above
2017-08-10T17:41:12 <gtirloni_> awesome! thanks so much
2017-08-10T17:47:15 <Justin_o> gtirloni_, cindyli: I've submitted a PR https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/pull/6 Could you review and merge.

2017-08-10T18:00:58 <jhung> Justin_o: I've looked over FLUID-6181. So basically the work was to rearrange the links into 3 columns?
2017-08-10T18:02:21 <Justin_o> jhung: not exactly.. so 1) i corrected the broken links, for example the links to the prefs framework manual tests 2) Added in missing links for tests, demos, and all of the examples ( which is the new middle column ) 3) put the SJRK tests under the tests column

2017-08-10T12:51:11 <grrrero> Hi Justin_o (again :) was wondering what I should do with this https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5534
2017-08-10T12:52:28 <Justin_o> grrrero: i think maybe we should take a look at the code that is in the branch and see what\'s missing. I\'ll take a quick peak over it in a minute, just writing up a JIRA at the moment
2017-08-10T12:52:36 <grrrero> Alrighty Justin_o
2017-08-10T12:55:01 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-08-10T12:59:45 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay, i just skimmed it. I think the first step would be to test it out the code that is in the FLUID-5534 branch and make sure it actually works. I believe we are only supporting mouse/touch interactions for the arrows. For those using the keyboard, they can tab directly through the adjusters.
2017-08-10T13:00:22 <Justin_o> grrrero: we currently support latest Firefox, Safari, Chrome, MS Edge and IE 11
2017-08-10T13:01:39 <Justin_o> grrrero: although for the arrows the method we use doesn\'t work in IE so i think the arrows won\'t/shouldn\'t show up at all in there
2017-08-10T13:01:55 <Justin_o> grrrero: if you have a phone you can test on as well, that would be good
2017-08-10T13:02:19 <Justin_o> grrrero: if all that goes well, we should make sure the tests pass in those browsers and make sure the test coverage is good enough
2017-08-10T13:02:34 <grrrero> Justin_o: So we\'re testing out the arrows for mouse/touch? Not keyboard
2017-08-10T13:02:50 <grrrero> Or keyboard as well
2017-08-10T13:03:01 <Justin_o> grrrero: correct, but make sure that you are able to use the keyboard to navigate between the adjusters
2017-08-10T13:03:06 <grrrero> Right
2017-08-10T13:03:09 <grrrero> Ok! Justin_o
2017-08-10T13:03:13 <Justin_o> for example hitting the tab key should move focus to the next adjuster
2017-08-10T13:03:20 <Justin_o> grrrero:  great thanks

2017-08-10T14:00:56 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-08-10T14:02:26 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thought you meant in general with working with the master branch
2017-08-10T14:03:09 <gtirloni> ah no, feature branchs really. i used to merge master into them but moved to rebasing lately.. i was wondering if that wouldn\'t case any issues (or deviate from best practices)
2017-08-10T14:03:19 <gtirloni> s/case/cause/
2017-08-10T14:04:09 <Justin_o> gtirloni: if i understand correctly that would just  move all of your commits in the branch up to the top essentially
2017-08-10T14:04:38 <gtirloni> right
2017-08-10T14:05:07 <gtirloni> the history becomes linear
2017-08-10T14:05:25 <gtirloni> but it\'s a no-go for public master branches as it messes up the history
2017-08-10T14:05:43 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i think that\'s probably fine. I guess you might run into an issue if you are working on the branch with someone or sharing it publicly and the commit numbers are changed after updating from master, but otherwise seems good.
2017-08-10T14:05:53 <Justin_o> yes, exactly

2017-08-10T16:26:20 <Justin_o> for that comment, are you asking if you can remove the theme function call, or something else?
2017-08-10T16:26:40 <grrrero> Yeah
2017-08-10T16:26:43 <grrrero> Justin_o
2017-08-10T16:27:04 <grrrero> Since we\'re never going to call those functions either, can we remove the functions themselves?
2017-08-10T16:27:12 <grrrero> Except for Enactors
2017-08-10T16:28:34 <Justin_o> grrrero: actually i just double checked the theme specific ones look to actually have different implementations, so they are actually probably necessary in each of the specific files
2017-08-10T16:28:57 <Justin_o> jhung: can you confirm? ^
2017-08-10T16:32:36 <jhung> Justin_o, grrrero: Just catching up. So the issue is that there are redundant calls to stylus functions generating CSS in multiple .styl files. Corrent?
2017-08-10T16:32:55 <jhung> *correct
2017-08-10T16:33:28 <grrrero> jhung: Yep, wondering if they are necessary
2017-08-10T16:33:35 <grrrero> As Justin_o mentioned
2017-08-10T16:33:42 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, well specifically there are theme generation functions called in several files, although they are different functions
2017-08-10T16:34:54 <jhung> Can you give me an example Justin_o?
2017-08-10T16:35:37 <Justin_o> jhung: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/css/stylus/utils/Themes.styl
2017-08-10T16:36:01 <Justin_o> basically are all of those functions required
2017-08-10T16:37:01 <jhung> Justin_o, grrrero - can we Vidyo? My brain is a bit mush today, so it may be easier to just show me. \xe2\x80\xa6 morning caffeine is wearing off.
2017-08-10T16:37:06 <Justin_o> jhung: sure
2017-08-10T16:37:18 <jhung> thanks

2017-08-10T16:40:17 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m trying out the first-discovery-server. I used your modifications, so the npm install passed. I\'m trying to use vagrant but i\'m getting an error because node won\'t install into the vagrant box.
2017-08-10T16:40:55 <Justin_o> I think it can\'t find the package for centos
2017-08-10T16:42:02 <gtirloni> please change this file https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/provisioning/vagrant-vars.yml (comment lines 3 and 5, then run `vagrant provision`)
2017-08-10T16:42:05 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-10T16:56:09 * danayo has quit
2017-08-10T17:00:41 <grrrero> Justin_o: recommitted. And then put it in infusion docs right?
2017-08-10T17:01:02 <grrrero> Plus JIRA
2017-08-10T17:01:57 <Justin_o> grrrero: yes, and leave a comment in the styl file for each that are deprecated
2017-08-10T17:02:05 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2017-08-10T17:02:56 <grrrero> I can remove the @imports too right? Justin_o
2017-08-10T17:03:04 <grrrero> @import "utils/Themes"
2017-08-10T17:03:04 <grrrero> @import "utils/Fonts"
2017-08-10T17:03:30 <Justin_o> grrrero: yes, if nothing from those files are being used where they are currently being imported.
2017-08-10T17:03:36 <grrrero> Ok
2017-08-10T17:07:45 <grrrero> Justin_o: Would I create this as a "story" in JIRA?
2017-08-10T17:08:05 <Justin_o> grrrero: you can make it a task
2017-08-10T17:08:11 <grrrero> Ok Justin_o
2017-08-10T17:09:04 <grrrero> Is the JIRA numbering system arbitrary?
2017-08-10T17:10:10 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: So vagrant is running and I have it trying to launch the server but am getting an error that gpii.firstDiscovery.server.preferences.router can\'t be found as component
2017-08-10T17:10:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: did you get past the creation phase?
