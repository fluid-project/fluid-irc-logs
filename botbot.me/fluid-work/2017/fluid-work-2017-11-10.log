2017-11-10T13:36:48 <georgitodorov> There are some edge case and we have a few questions regarding your code. We are in the process of adding these to your PR.
2017-11-10T13:40:44 <kasparnet> awesome, cheers georgitodorov - already looked at some of your input on the PR and they\'re all great! I wont get around to addressing them today, but will start working on it first thing next week
2017-11-10T13:45:06 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: That sounds good, thank you.

2017-11-10T16:45:25 <gloob> Bosmon: you around?
2017-11-10T16:47:42 <gloob> Bosmon: I\'m trying to implement a hotfix for trigger a key-out if gpii detects at start-up that gpii crashed meanwhile an user keyed-in. I found that journal.findCrashed could be the one that trigger and recover that but it seems it needs some "recovering logic" yet, is that correct?
2017-11-10T16:51:36 <gloob> ok, I find that https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1235 is about that

2017-11-10T17:33:40 <Bosmon> Hi there gloob - why do we want to trigger a key-out in this case?
2017-11-10T17:34:03 <gloob> to recover in case of disaster
2017-11-10T17:34:12 <gloob> say, reboot not controlled, etc..
2017-11-10T17:34:21 <Bosmon> gloob - and how does a key-out allow us to recover in case of disaster?
2017-11-10T17:35:43 <gloob> well, I\'ll prefer to do a journal.restoreJournal
2017-11-10T17:35:59 <Bosmon> gloob - do you have a JIRA for your current work?
2017-11-10T17:36:07 <Bosmon> How was it decided on?
2017-11-10T17:36:18 <gloob> Bosmon: well, in some cases like simi and sven, we want to recover the original state because the only way for the user to recover is to keyout using the browser
2017-11-10T17:36:27 <gloob> it\'s not decided, I\'m wondering if it\'s viable
2017-11-10T17:36:41 <gloob> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2680
2017-11-10T17:36:47 <Bosmon> Thanks
2017-11-10T17:37:09 <Bosmon> gloob - the JIRA is a bit sparse :)
2017-11-10T17:37:18 <Bosmon> It\'s what in the industry we call a "TLJ"
2017-11-10T17:37:18 <gloob> it\'s something that happens frequently when the people do the demos
2017-11-10T17:37:26 <gloob> Bosmon: yes, it\'s
2017-11-10T17:37:30 <Bosmon> Do you have a plan that you have agreed with UX for this work?
2017-11-10T17:38:34 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-11-10T17:38:42 <gloob> TLJ? the last jedi?
2017-11-10T17:39:03 <Bosmon> "TWO LINE JIRA" : P
2017-11-10T17:39:09 <gloob> haha
2017-11-10T17:39:18 <Bosmon> ask kasparnet since historically he used to be our worst perpetrator of these
2017-11-10T17:39:21 <gloob> well, it\'s developing
2017-11-10T17:39:24 <Bosmon> But then we got so many new people on the project :)
2017-11-10T17:39:55 <Bosmon> gloob - the problem you will have if you key out is that the most recent journal will then no longer be the crashed one
2017-11-10T17:40:03 <Bosmon> So you have a number of issues to tackle
2017-11-10T17:40:19 <Bosmon> But I think in general trying to do something automatically is likely to startle and upset the user
2017-11-10T17:40:21 <gloob> but do you think it is worth that feature?
2017-11-10T17:40:23 <gloob> I think it is
2017-11-10T17:40:28 <Bosmon> You should have a talk to Bern about what he would like to be done in this situation
2017-11-10T17:40:41 <Bosmon> Since we can\'t just implement something random in an engineering-led way : P
2017-11-10T17:40:46 <gloob> yes, but in this case you block the user, with simi

2017-11-10T18:10:28 <amatas> Now the CI also run the tests of the master branch of universal
2017-11-10T18:14:10 <gtirloni> amatas: that\'s nice, so please ignore my comment there. is it possible to use the GUI to run the job and have it work? previously it would complain about the $variable that weren\'t set. how did you achieve that?
2017-11-10T18:15:27 <gtirloni> (variable that would be set by the GHPR plugin, i mean)

2017-11-10T18:26:43 <amatas> gtirloni: :( you\'re right, I thought that this plugins was enough smart to know the reference of the branch where you are brwosing
2017-11-10T18:27:04 <amatas> https://github.com/jenkinsci/embeddable-build-status-plugin/issues/21
2017-11-10T18:29:15 <gtirloni> oh :( yeah, that missing feature with the GHPR plugin not working on master (AFAIK) is a major bummer
2017-11-10T18:29:31 <gtirloni> i was excited that could been fixed, it gave Avtar and I a lot of headaches
2017-11-10T18:30:40 <amatas> well, I was thinking on create a duplicate of the universal-tests job definition but only for master, and enable de badge only for that job
2017-11-10T18:31:27 <amatas> it\'s not the optimal as it would be a duplication of the job, but it\'s the only way that comes to my mind
2017-11-10T18:32:15 <gtirloni> if you can get GH to not send PR/comments to that job, that would actually work. it would duplicate work in our current workflow (i.e. code gets tested twice, first in the PR and then when it\'s merged) but maybe that\'s acceptable given our workload?
