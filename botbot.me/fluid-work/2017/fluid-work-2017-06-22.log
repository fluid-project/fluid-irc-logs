2017-06-22T19:55:39 <clown> sounds familiar.  the screen has long since started to swim around for me.
2017-06-22T19:56:05 <michelled> that\'s when I generally start reading out loud to the cats
2017-06-22T19:56:13 <michelled> too bad no one brought their cats in today ...
2017-06-22T19:56:36 <clown> alanharn_:  I just shared the risks document with you.  Could you read my edits to that paragraph and see what you think?  Thanks!
2017-06-22T19:57:11 <clown> michelled:  and your cats don\'t up and leave the room???
2017-06-22T19:57:48 <clown> btw, I\'m inclined to accept all of colinclark\'s spelling grammar fixes.  any objections?
2017-06-22T19:57:50 <michelled> sometimes it make Arthur sit on the keyboard -
2017-06-22T19:57:55 <michelled> no objections
2017-06-22T19:57:57 <alanharnum> that reads well to me, clown
2017-06-22T19:58:11 <clown> alanharnum:  \\o/
2017-06-22T19:58:35 <colinclark> alanharnum: While you\'re in the document...
2017-06-22T19:58:41 <colinclark> I\'m curious about your thoughts regarding the security section
2017-06-22T19:59:02 <colinclark> clown\'s quite reasonable point is that we frame security issues and mitigartions throughout
2017-06-22T19:59:28 <colinclark> Jutta seems to point at need to describe the security challenges associated with privacy preferences
2017-06-22T19:59:42 <colinclark> I\'m trying to think through what might go there, if anything
2017-06-22T20:06:35 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-06-22T20:13:28 <alanharnum> clown colinclark - caveat that i\'ve just now skimmed the whole document quickly, but my thoughts:
2017-06-22T20:14:11 <alanharnum> 1) Make a reference back to the discussion of security in the "Exposure of Privacy Preferences" section
2017-06-22T20:14:56 <alanharnum> 2) per Jutta\'s point about "vulnerabilities exposed in even using a privacy preferences tool / why do you want to keep this secret" that may be worth commenting on would be the issue of non-widespread adoption - I know this has been an issue for PGP, TOR and other tools, which is that the mere use of them is perceived as suspicious, partly because of low adoption
2017-06-22T20:16:31 <clown> alanharnum:  I really like your first idea of a back pointer.
2017-06-22T20:16:40 * clown still processing the second point
2017-06-22T20:17:56 <alanharnum> 3) Ensuring transparency requirements would require some level of reporting or auditing; it\'s some of the same issue with any question of "is this corporate entity actually doing what it says it will do with our data"
2017-06-22T20:18:12 <michelled> alanharnum, clown: I wonder if we should just rename the section to \'Security of Privacy Preferences\'
2017-06-22T20:18:28 <alanharnum> We could stick in some points about the use of blockchain or similar to enforce one-to-one contracts, but I\'m hesitant to go down that buzzword-laden, ill-understood road :p
2017-06-22T20:18:39 <clown> three is covered by PIPEDA in that organziations are supposed to have user enquiry policies.
2017-06-22T20:18:57 <alanharnum> 4) One more point on this point: "Another risk results from using the software where it is not deployed properly. An example is the use of unsecured data transmission; specifically, in the open web, when HTTP is used for transmitting sensitive data instead of HTTPS, or, the server is not properly protected behind firewall. To mitigate this issue, the software producer needs to provide instructions of how the software c
2017-06-22T20:18:57 <alanharnum> an be properly deployed.  In addition, the personnel should follow instructions and deploy the software properly."
2017-06-22T20:18:59 * clown really like michelled\'s idea
2017-06-22T20:19:24 <alanharnum> I think this should mention that the software could be engineered in such a way that it would refuse to communicate over a non-encrypted channel or similar.
2017-06-22T20:19:41 <colinclark> I think michelled\'s idea is probably reasonable
2017-06-22T20:21:20 <colinclark> especially with alanharnum\'s points added\xe2\x80\x94I think it\'s worth mentioning the importance of auditing and transparency in terms of a service provider\'s compliance with an individual\'s privacy preferences and with our "security recommendations"
2017-06-22T20:21:22 <clown> How about "Exposure and Security of Privacy Preferences" ?
2017-06-22T20:21:51 <clown> as the new title?
2017-06-22T20:22:00 <colinclark> I might literally call the section "Security Assessment" :P
2017-06-22T20:28:41 * danayo has quit
2017-06-22T20:32:42 <clown> colinclark, michelled, alanharnum, the section has been moved and retitled, "Security Assessement".
2017-06-22T20:32:47 <colinclark> awesome
2017-06-22T20:32:53 <clown> I\'ll now delete the original section.
2017-06-22T20:32:56 <colinclark> i\'m going to bounce up to the section dana just responded to and tweak it
2017-06-22T20:33:05 <colinclark> and then we can look at the security section one last time
2017-06-22T20:33:17 <colinclark> and then do you think we can ship this, michelled?
2017-06-22T20:33:30 <michelled> yes, I think so
2017-06-22T20:33:48 <michelled> there\'s a possibility we\'ll need to do a little more tomorrow, but Jutta will have a chance tonight to add things she wants
2017-06-22T20:33:53 <colinclark> right
2017-06-22T20:34:06 <colinclark> at least we can "ship it" into a word doc :)
2017-06-22T20:34:34 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-06-22T20:35:02 * danayo joined the channel
2017-06-22T20:36:16 <clown> and email that word doc to the usual suspects.
2017-06-22T20:36:57 <clown> actaully, there is still a risk we noted as "project failure", but nothing has been written for it.
2017-06-22T20:37:18 <clown> I can\'t think of anything useful to say \xe2\x80\x94 all projects suffer this risk.
2017-06-22T20:37:27 <clown> I\'m inclined to remove that point.
2017-06-22T20:37:37 <clown> michelled, colinclark ^
2017-06-22T20:38:20 <michelled> clown, do we link out to the PIPEDA assessment anywhere?

2017-06-22T20:39:39 <michelled> ah, I found it - thx
2017-06-22T20:39:46 <clown> actually, they should be easy to find:  look for "policy" or "policies".
2017-06-22T20:39:49 <clown> ah, okay.

2017-06-22T14:51:32 <Bosmon7> Hi there gtirloni - I wonder if you can help with a vagrant/fedora situation
2017-06-22T14:51:42 <gtirloni> sure
2017-06-22T14:51:51 <Bosmon7> I\'m trying to test out this pull request
2017-06-22T14:51:52 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/508
2017-06-22T14:52:01 <Bosmon7> After typing vagrant up, I see the VM apparently trying to start up
2017-06-22T14:52:16 <Bosmon7> And it does the text mode progress bar, and then the "f" mode progress bar
2017-06-22T14:52:23 <Bosmon7> But it then says "Welcome to emergency mode!"
2017-06-22T14:52:43 <Bosmon7> There\'s an error listed before this - "Error getting authority"
2017-06-22T14:53:05 <Bosmon7> (g-io-error-quark, 1)
2017-06-22T14:53:26 <gtirloni> wow, emergency mode inside the VM ?
2017-06-22T14:54:07 <gtirloni> that would indicate a (virtual) disk issue.. I\'d try to run `vagrant destroy -f` followed by `vagrant box update` and `vagrant up` again

2017-06-22T19:47:26 <colinclark> I added my own annoying list of questions to one section :)
2017-06-22T19:47:44 <colinclark> The only thing I find myself puzzling over is the Security section
2017-06-22T19:47:51 <clown> colinclark:  thanks, but mostly I just edited other people\'s suggestions, while adding my 2 cents
2017-06-22T19:48:03 <colinclark> well, still, it reads really well
2017-06-22T19:48:04 <clown> yes?
2017-06-22T19:48:06 <colinclark> extremely nice work
2017-06-22T19:48:13 <colinclark> I see your point about how we\'ve covered a lot of the security issues above in the privacy section
2017-06-22T19:48:23 <colinclark> on the other hand, I wonder whether Jutta\'s point still stands
2017-06-22T19:48:26 <colinclark> however awkwardly
2017-06-22T19:48:37 <colinclark> I\'m trying to imagine what might be a) missing or b) can be moved
2017-06-22T19:49:07 <clown> me too.  I didn\'t want to end up repeating something that was already there, and make it look like fluff added to bulk up the document.
2017-06-22T19:49:16 <colinclark> yes
2017-06-22T19:49:18 <colinclark> we don\'t want that
2017-06-22T19:49:21 <colinclark> I wonder if it would be viable to list a set of "recommended practices" for securing personal preferences, based on some of the risk you outline above?
2017-06-22T19:49:49 <colinclark> I mean, could it just be a paragraph or so basically describing the importance of the kinds of issues Jutta raises in her comments
2017-06-22T19:50:01 <colinclark> combined with a set of recommended practices for addressing those issues
2017-06-22T19:50:18 <clown> i\'m inclined to say that if you know what this list is or even if you just have a rough idea, put it in.
2017-06-22T19:50:24 <colinclark> ha
2017-06-22T19:50:32 <colinclark> well, i\'m just thinking aloud here
2017-06-22T19:50:37 <colinclark> rather than knowing what exactly it is :)
2017-06-22T19:51:15 <colinclark> The section I\'m currently highlighting seems like it could migrate into this new security section
2017-06-22T19:51:19 <clown> yes, well, I\'m not sure I know more than you here.  If there were something concrete in the document, even rough, I could start working with that and (maybe) flesh it out.
2017-06-22T19:51:21 <colinclark> with a bit of elaboration
