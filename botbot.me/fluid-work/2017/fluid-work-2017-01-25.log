2017-01-25T14:52:53 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I am not able to connect to the #fluid-design channel. Anyone else having this problem?
2017-01-25T14:53:30 <clown> jhung:  I\'m not having a problem
2017-01-25T14:53:38 <simonjb> jhung: fine for me, maybe try reconnecting to freenode and see if you get a different server?
2017-01-25T14:53:40 <Justin_o> jhung: at least clown and I are there
2017-01-25T14:54:06 <jhung> thanks clown, Justin_o, simonjb. I\'ll try logging in again.

2017-01-25T15:22:58 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - do you think you might have time to look at https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/497 at some point?
2017-01-25T15:23:06 <Bosmon> I thought of you since you had reviewed the original journalling pull
2017-01-25T15:23:17 <Bosmon> But perhaps cindyli could do it too

2017-01-25T16:03:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: could you take a look at my PR to update the eslint config https://github.com/fluid-project/eslint-config-fluid/pull/2
2017-01-25T16:05:52 <stegru> colinclark: Bosmon , sandra requires you
2017-01-25T16:07:08 <mrtyler> colinclark: hey
2017-01-25T16:07:12 <mrtyler> colinclark: hey come to this meeting
2017-01-25T16:07:15 <mrtyler> colinclark: colinclark
2017-01-25T16:08:10 <colinclark> I feel SO POPULAR! :)
2017-01-25T16:53:31 <stegru> michelled: is michelled/gpii-app:GPII-1596 the "master" for the gpii app?
2017-01-25T16:53:57 <michelled> ummm\xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose it\'s the only branch with anything done on it :)
2017-01-25T16:54:23 <michelled> I have *so* many meetings today. it would be so good to get it into the actual master.
2017-01-25T16:54:29 <stegru> good, thanks
2017-01-25T16:55:16 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2017-01-25T16:55:19 <stegru> well, i\'m not expecting to push any changes to it soon, i\'d just like to see the latest version
2017-01-25T17:38:03 <gloob> michelled: are you going to merge it to master
2017-01-25T17:38:04 <gloob> ?
2017-01-25T17:41:41 <michelled> gloob, not until it passes code review
2017-01-25T17:41:52 <michelled> gloob: so probably *after* HST
2017-01-25T17:46:03 * kasparne_ has quit

2017-01-25T18:19:34 <michelled> oh gloob, no, I like to keep my own master in sync with the upstream master
2017-01-25T18:19:58 <michelled> I realize that at the moment it isn\'t all that useful, but it makes it easier on highly used repos
2017-01-25T18:23:11 * avtar joined the channel
2017-01-25T18:23:26 <gloob> michelled: ah ok, so I should keep listening in the branch
