b'2017-03-16T15:23:18 <Justin_o> I think something like "on, table of contents, switch" might be more concise
2017-03-16T15:23:30 <clown> Justin_o:  "clown: what do you think of this implementation?"  I like it.  But either the "on/off" text is too small for the size of the switch, or the switch is too big for the "on/off" text.
2017-03-16T15:23:54 <Justin_o> clown: yes, that\'s all going to be adjusted, it\'s just a rough example right now
2017-03-16T15:24:16 <Justin_o> the actual designs have the text heavier and the switch shorter
2017-03-16T15:24:28 <Justin_o> clown: what do you think of my use of label and aria-labelledby?
2017-03-16T15:25:02 <Justin_o> danayo: I don\'t mind leaving the label as is for now, but thought i\'d put it out there for now as something to think about
2017-03-16T15:25:17 <clown> Justin_o re: sizing and layout:  I see, you are still working on that.  Okay.  Re: naming; let me see.
2017-03-16T15:25:33 <cindyli> super, thanks, jhernandez
2017-03-16T15:27:46 <clown> Justin_o: is there a reason for not using <label id="label" for="toc-choice">Create a table of contents</label> ?
2017-03-16T15:28:22 <clown> oh, I think I just saw it.
2017-03-16T15:28:46 <cindyli> jhernandez: it sets a dom attribute \'ts\' - https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud/blob/master/content.js#L36. what is that? is there such an attribute?
2017-03-16T15:29:01 <Justin_o> clown: so the reasons are 1) using a label to automatically get the switch to change the checkbox state 2) i\'m not sure we want the textual label to be clickable to toggle the switch..
2017-03-16T15:29:27 <jhernandez> cindyli: yes, that attribute is being injected by the extension
2017-03-16T15:29:45 <cindyli> is there such a dom attribute?
2017-03-16T15:29:47 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud/blob/master/content.css
2017-03-16T15:30:04 <cindyli> ok. i see. thanks, jhernandez
2017-03-16T15:30:56 <clown> Justin_o:  2) makes sense.  When will you be sure?  :-)
2017-03-16T15:31:38 <Justin_o> I\'m sort of putting that out there as a discussion now i guess :)
2017-03-16T15:31:42 <Justin_o> danayo: do you have thoughts?
2017-03-16T15:32:01 <Justin_o> should the textual label "Create a table of contents" be clickable?
2017-03-16T15:32:26 <clown> My question would be:  how do swtiches iOS and android, etc.work with respect to their labels?
2017-03-16T15:32:40 <clown> I think the labels are inert there.
2017-03-16T15:32:59 <clown> but I\'d have to look to be sure.
2017-03-16T15:33:05 * clown standup
2017-03-16T15:33:21 <Justin_o> clown: looked at my phone just now, and you\'re right that the label doesn\'t activate the switch
2017-03-16T15:33:55 <danayo> Justin_o: I was thinking labels shouldn\'t be clickable, just the toggle itself

2017-03-16T16:14:38 <jhernandez> cindyli: specifically these https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/mappings/ISO24751-flat.json5

2017-03-16T18:24:40 <jhung> colinclark: the theme I used to create the BIG IDeA theme was GPL licensed. This automatically means that the new theme is GPL, correct?
2017-03-16T18:24:49 <colinclark> Yes
2017-03-16T18:24:51 <colinclark> :(
2017-03-16T18:26:09 <jhung> colinclark: do you think that\'s an issue?
2017-03-16T18:27:07 <colinclark> Well, it might not be
2017-03-16T18:27:09 <colinclark> but it could be
2017-03-16T18:27:16 <colinclark> WordPress itself is GPL
2017-03-16T18:27:31 <colinclark> and GPL\'s viral nature is such that anything related to WP is pretty much always GPL
2017-03-16T18:27:37 <colinclark> the real question is our modifications
2017-03-16T18:29:08 <jhung> I assume that modifications and new features would be GPL as well due to the viral nature?
2017-03-16T18:29:16 <colinclark> yes
2017-03-16T18:29:43 <colinclark> everything we do inside a GPL codebase automatically becomes GPL
2017-03-16T18:29:51 <colinclark> and everything we link to GPL code must be compatible with it

2017-03-16T18:30:08 * kasparnet has quit
2017-03-16T18:30:40 <colinclark> Fortunately Infusion is suitable for linking to the GPL
2017-03-16T18:31:08 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-03-16T18:31:23 <jhung> colinclark: so any theme we develop for WP would be GPL regardless of where the theme starts from, correct?
2017-03-16T18:32:12 <colinclark> I believe so, yes
2017-03-16T18:32:32 <colinclark> assuming the theme is "linked to" (part of) a WordPress instance, it will automatically have to be GPL\'ed
2017-03-16T18:33:05 <colinclark> https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-licensing-the-gpl/
2017-03-16T18:33:38 <colinclark> "If you have no plans to distribute your theme then you do not need to adopt the GPL license for your work. The GPL only applies to distributed software... If you wish to submit your creation to the free theme repository on WordPress.org, it must be 100% GPL compliant, including CSS and image files."
2017-03-16T18:37:38 <jhung> colinclark:  I also see that if a work is original, it doesn\'t have to be GPL. Many of the changes I\'ve done are original. Could those parts be refactored and licensed differently? Not sure if we have intention on distributing on Wordpress.org, but I suppose we haven\'t ruled it out.
2017-03-16T18:37:51 <colinclark> Yes, that\'s pretty much it
2017-03-16T18:38:13 <colinclark> Whenever you make something new, the copyright for it is automatically owned by OCAD University
2017-03-16T18:38:22 <colinclark> and when you own the IP, you can choose to license it differently
2017-03-16T18:38:33 <colinclark> That\'s actually the sort of "corporate trick" of the GPL
2017-03-16T18:38:50 <colinclark> Richard Stallman always imagined it would be used as a way to force stuff to be free
2017-03-16T18:39:14 <colinclark> but often you\'ll find companies who hold the IP for something, and they\'ll release the code as GPL and also offer a paid proprietary license
2017-03-16T18:39:31 <colinclark> anyway, the point is that when you link something that you made to GPL code, you have to license it as GPL
2017-03-16T18:39:48 <colinclark> but if you own it, that doesn\'t preclude you from, if it\'s separable, also licensing it under some other license
2017-03-16T18:40:15 <jhung> colinclark: ok. Good to know. I\'ll go through my codebase and refactor as needed. This is good to know before I push it up to my repo.
2017-03-16T18:40:32 <colinclark> And in regards to distributing it on wordpress.org or not, that section of the document is somewhat misleading
2017-03-16T18:40:43 <jhung> ^ yes I noticed that
2017-03-16T18:40:45 <colinclark> ANY distribution, regardless of how you do it, is subject to the GPL
2017-03-16T18:40:54 <colinclark> so if you post it to Github, that counts as distribution
2017-03-16T18:45:10 <jhung> Hmmm okay. I\'d have to look into that. Perhaps a way to deal with this is to separate the repos? One for the original works and the other based off the GPL theme. Would that keep the licenses intact?
2017-03-16T18:46:25 <jhung> I\'m just trying to figure out what would be the best approach to dealing with the changes I\'ve made to this theme while making sure the licenses are amicable in the long run. This stuff always confuses me.

2017-03-16T19:01:31 <jhung> ok. I need to do some clean-up anyway. So this would be a good opportunity to refactor colinclark. Let\'s chat tomorrow.

2017-03-16T12:28:28 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I figured out both problems with gpii-testem and Windows, that should be ready for further review.
2017-03-16T12:28:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I updated gpii-pouchdb to use the new dev version of gpii-testem, those tests pass currently.
2017-03-16T12:29:09 <the-t-in-rtf> See the PR for details, there were intermittent issues with IE that I can no longer reproduce.

2017-03-16T12:36:14 <Bosmon> As it sheds light on various unvisited corners of Fluid.js
2017-03-16T12:36:37 <Bosmon> There are signs that this rewrite might be able to remove amounts of code comparable to the amount which I add
2017-03-16T12:36:42 <Bosmon> Which is always an encouraging kind of rewrite

2017-03-16T13:04:31 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, now that I have a more stable version of gpii-testem, I am resuming work on the universal code coverage.
2017-03-16T13:04:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I hope to have that either tomorrow or Monday.
2017-03-16T13:05:20 <the-t-in-rtf> The initial problem there is that istanbul implicitly ignores a node_modules subdirectory under the directory you wish to instrument
2017-03-16T13:05:34 <the-t-in-rtf> for example, the gpii dir in universal, which only contains a node_modules directory
2017-03-16T13:06:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a workaround, which is simply to instrument gpii/node_modules instead

2017-03-16T13:18:24 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s interesting to see the "times hit" numbers go down in the branches.
2017-03-16T13:18:38 <the-t-in-rtf> and also to see that we hit the core code 700,000+ times in the tests.
2017-03-16T13:20:24 <Bosmon> http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-coverage-20170308/framework/core/js/Fluid.js.html
2017-03-16T13:20:37 <Bosmon> There\'s something funny here at line 1002
2017-03-16T13:20:44 <Bosmon> Since I am completely confident that this code is executed
2017-03-16T13:20:51 <Bosmon> And some of it is even associated with a particular test case
2017-03-16T13:21:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I have sometimes found tests that were not included in the right rollups.
2017-03-16T13:21:46 <the-t-in-rtf> which is also useful to know.
2017-03-16T13:21:55 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. there are tests, we just aren\'t running them.
2017-03-16T13:22:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, this is exactly why I shared these with people like you much more familiar with the code.
2017-03-16T13:22:34 <Bosmon> In particular this branch is exercised by this test: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCViewTests.js#L192
2017-03-16T13:22:49 <Bosmon> So I wonder where it has failed to be registered from
2017-03-16T13:23:07 <Bosmon> It\'s indexed here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/all-tests.html#L34
2017-03-16T13:23:10 <Bosmon> Where else does it need to be?
2017-03-16T13:24:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, there are apparently two all-tests rollups.
2017-03-16T13:24:15 <the-t-in-rtf> And it\'s in both.
2017-03-16T13:24:31 <Bosmon> Very odd
2017-03-16T13:24:38 <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps not.
2017-03-16T13:24:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I haven\'t rerun those tests since I made recent improvements to gpii-testem
2017-03-16T13:25:01 <the-t-in-rtf> it may be that the coverage was not sent successfully for that test.
2017-03-16T13:25:18 <the-t-in-rtf> My recent efforts make it much clearer which tests the coverage is for, I can rerun that.
2017-03-16T13:25:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I would do it today, but I have about five minutes before I have to pick up the little one.
2017-03-16T13:25:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll put it on my calendar for first thing tomorrow.

2017-03-16T13:26:29 <Bosmon> And Firefox\'s are not given per line

2017-03-16T14:22:28 <Justin_o> clown: if there is an input that has a label element associated with it, but also has an aria-labledby attribute, does one win out?
2017-03-16T14:42:40 * sirdancealot has quit
2017-03-16T14:43:22 <clown> Justin_o: yes, the aria-labelledby will win.
2017-03-16T14:43:53 <clown> do you need spec referencees, Justin_o?

2017-03-16T14:55:51 <Justin_o> clown: uh, if you have it handy but your answer is good for what i need i think. Thanks for the help.
2017-03-16T14:59:15 <clown> Justin_o:  if you look at the accessible name algorithm, if has the form if (\xe2\x80\xa6) then (\xe2\x80\xa6), otherwise if (\xe2\x80\xa6) then (\xe2\x80\xa6), otherwise \xe2\x80\xa6  The first if-then that is satisfied is what is used.
2017-03-16T15:00:42 <clown> and, aria-labelledby is the first condition looked for.  see:  https://w3c.github.io/aria/accname-aam/accname-aam.html#step2B
2017-03-16T15:03:01 <Justin_o> clown: awesome thanks

2017-03-16T15:07:08 <cindyli> jhernandez: do you know what text size and line space values are expected to be received within the chrome extension from GPII?
2017-03-16T15:08:25 <clown> Justin_o:  to be complete, the <label> elemsent isn\'t considered until step 2D.  Note that <label> isn\'t  stated explicitly; the wording is in terms of native elements or attributes that are used for text alternatives.  HTML provides <label> and @alt (I think that\'s all in HTML).  https://w3c.github.io/aria/accname-aam/accname-aam.html#step2D
2017-03-16T15:08:40 <cindyli> i remember seeing a google doc for common registry. i wonder if that doc has default values for each registry entry. do you have the link to that doc, jhernandez
2017-03-16T15:08:54 <jhernandez> cindyli: right now there\'s no support for such settings in the extension, let me check what we had in cloud4chrome
2017-03-16T15:09:02 <cindyli> thanks
2017-03-16T15:09:09 <jhernandez> let me find that doc
2017-03-16T15:09:17 <clown> cindyli, jhernandez:  https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Cloud4all_Testing:_Essential_Registry_Terms  ?
2017-03-16T15:09:21 <cindyli> i added the support for those settings using UIO enactors
2017-03-16T15:09:28 <cindyli> thanks, clown
2017-03-16T15:09:53 <clown> my pleasure cindyli
2017-03-16T15:10:01 <jhernandez> oh, that wiki page
2017-03-16T15:10:03 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-03-16T15:10:44 <clown> and, if it helps:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/mappings/ISO24751-flat.json5
2017-03-16T15:11:26 <clown> yeah, jhernandez, that wiki page.  I have no idea if it\'s up-to-date.
2017-03-16T15:11:41 <jhernandez> cindyli: take a look at this spreadsheet
2017-03-16T15:11:43 <jhernandez> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cj9YTzM6usgd96XFn60TGN6bfMYTLCgWVMycoA4JhA8/edit?usp=sharing
2017-03-16T15:12:33 <jhernandez> there are value ranges for the font size common term but not for line spacing
2017-03-16T15:14:09 <jhernandez> okay, there\'s no definition for "line spacing"
2017-03-16T15:14:11 <jhernandez> YET
2017-03-16T15:14:32 <jhernandez> so we have to add it
2017-03-16T15:14:52 <Justin_o> clown: what do you think of this implementation? https://jsfiddle.net/kst7ajtw/8/
2017-03-16T15:14:55 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-03-16T15:15:00 <cindyli> jhernandez: the default value for font size is 12. i guess it means 12px. i wonder what we expect the chrome to apply when receiving 12px? i believe it won\'t be as simply as making all fonts 12px since there likely have different sizes on the page for headings etc
2017-03-16T15:16:26 <jhernandez> cindyli: right, I\'m not sure what the real interpretation of font size was in cloud4chrome
2017-03-16T15:16:38 * kasparnet has quit
2017-03-16T15:17:23 <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhernandez, i will make some notes and think about solutions
2017-03-16T15:18:05 <Justin_o> danayo: you might also like to look at https://jsfiddle.net/kst7ajtw/8/ The sizes aren\'t finalized yet, so don\'t worry that it looks really long at the moment
2017-03-16T15:18:07 <jhernandez> okay, it receives normal, large and x-large as values for font-size
2017-03-16T15:18:10 <jhernandez> cindyli: ^
2017-03-16T15:18:18 <Justin_o> danayo: also could you let me know what to do about focus styling
2017-03-16T15:18:19 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-03-16T15:18:26 <jhernandez> cindyli: https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud/blob/master/background.js#L396-L429
2017-03-16T15:19:19 <jhernandez> and yes, feel free to think about what it should receive as value
2017-03-16T15:19:46 <Justin_o> danayo, clown: i\'m also thinking that "Create a table of contents" sounds strange as a label, and may be better suited as a description instead. What do you think?
2017-03-16T15:20:12 <cindyli> ah ha. this is very helpful. i will look into the code to find out how chrome4cloud applies these strings. thanks, jhernandez
2017-03-16T15:20:36 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2017-03-16T15:21:29 <danayo> I\'ll sketch up focus state and still owe you the stepper mockup! (will get that to you shortly)
2017-03-16T15:22:04 <danayo> can you say more about why you think "create a table of contents" sounds strange Justin_o? it seems consistent with the other labels, no?
2017-03-16T15:22:23 <danayo> "change text and bkgrnd colour" "enhance buttons and links" etc
2017-03-16T15:22:51 <jhernandez> cindyli: look at https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud/blob/master/background.js#L544-L554 and
2017-03-16T15:23:04 <jhernandez> this is the action that is being triggered https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud/blob/master/content.js#L27-L72
2017-03-16T15:23:06 <Justin_o> danayo: so in VoiceOver it gets read back as something like "on, create a table of contents, switch".
