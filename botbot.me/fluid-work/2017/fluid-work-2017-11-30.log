2017-11-30T18:33:36 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: in the SendNotifyMessage, reaplace IntPtr with String on line 21

2017-11-30T18:35:29 <javjarfer[m]> "intl"?
2017-11-30T18:35:34 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: doing it
2017-11-30T18:39:41 <javjarfer[m]> (trying to cast from String to IntPtr in Powershell, not so trivial stuff)
2017-11-30T18:49:29 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: giving up with the powershell, doing it inside the C# inside the powershell

2017-11-30T19:02:54 <stegru> oh you don\'t cast it.. change the definition on line 21, javjarfer[m]
2017-11-30T19:21:34 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: magad, didn\'t knew that such a thing could actually do the trick
2017-11-30T19:22:14 <javjarfer[m]> it automatically generate the proper bindings when you change the definition?
2017-11-30T19:24:14 <stegru> yes, javjarfer[m]
2017-11-30T19:24:32 <javjarfer[m]> okay, that is really auto-magic, noting it!
2017-11-30T19:25:19 <stegru> it makes it send a pointer to the string
2017-11-30T19:25:59 <javjarfer[m]> yes, it\'s really nice, do you know what I was doing?
2017-11-30T19:26:15 <javjarfer[m]> creating in C# a non-marshalled string and passing it like a IntPtr
2017-11-30T19:26:37 <javjarfer[m]> but... you know, that is a lot cleaner xDDDD
2017-11-30T19:27:20 <javjarfer[m]> well, that actually did the trick! Thanks you stegru , moving forward to new settings
2017-11-30T19:27:59 <javjarfer[m]> last thing from this ones completed, I will need to add a payload option to the registry setting handler and call this after actually setting the registry key
2017-11-30T19:30:03 <javjarfer[m]> just a couple more of them, https://media.giphy.com/media/SuEFqeWxlLcvm/giphy.gif

2017-11-30T15:05:47 <cindyli> Bosmon: dataset meeting
2017-11-30T15:09:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - oh yes sorry, I had started coming
2017-11-30T15:09:26 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2017-11-30T15:09:36 <Bosmon> And then I got distracted and started some review in my browser windows before I found the gotomeeting one : P
2017-11-30T15:10:20 <gloob> stegru: that approach covers all the settings or just the ones covered by a registry key?
2017-11-30T15:11:30 <stegru> well, i don\'t know if it\'s possible yet.. but it looks like all(?) the settings in "Windows Settings" have a registry setting that...
2017-11-30T15:11:52 <stegru> points to some dll which contains the code to set the setting
2017-11-30T15:14:04 <stegru> the setting name is: "SystemSettings_Notifications_DoNotDisturb_Toggle", "SettingsHandlers_Notifications.dll" contains the code that performs the work
2017-11-30T15:14:12 <gloob> ok, I will test here with some of the fuzzy settings
2017-11-30T15:15:03 <stegru> none of this is documented, i\'m only guessing
2017-11-30T15:15:15 <stegru> "guestimating"
2017-11-30T15:16:34 <stegru> because it\'s you, i\'ll spend some more time on it

2017-11-30T15:17:26 <gloob> interesint settings to check are: peformance -> shadows under windows
2017-11-30T15:17:48 <gloob> stegru: I wish, but I\'m in the middle of a meeting, hopefully Justin_o is receiving all the attention
2017-11-30T15:18:13 <stegru> his voice can send me to sleep

2017-11-30T15:22:20 <stegru> that\'s interesting, it shows the values of the SPI call
2017-11-30T15:22:24 <gloob> and what your beast said?
2017-11-30T15:22:30 <gloob> umhhh, great
2017-11-30T15:22:35 <stegru> my beast?
2017-11-30T15:22:44 <gloob> so we can infere which kind of method we should use using that
2017-11-30T15:22:57 <stegru> yes, it looks like that
2017-11-30T15:23:14 <gloob> your little experiement, that beast
2017-11-30T15:23:25 <stegru> oh no, i just discovered that now
2017-11-30T15:23:33 <gloob> ok, so I\'m going to make a list with all the settings
2017-11-30T15:23:34 <stegru> procmon
2017-11-30T15:23:39 <gloob> and use your tool
2017-11-30T15:23:49 <gloob> ah, yes
2017-11-30T15:23:55 <gloob> with procmon we checked it
2017-11-30T15:24:20 <stegru> wait.. i used "system properties" -> "advanced system settings" -> "visual effects"
2017-11-30T15:26:33 <gloob> System properties -> Advanced -> Performance - settings -> Visual Effects
2017-11-30T15:26:37 <gloob> same yes
2017-11-30T15:26:42 <stegru> when you look at the values in that area of the registry.. it looks like there\'s the equivalent to a solutions registry
2017-11-30T15:27:43 <gloob> yep, it is the same key

2017-11-30T15:58:24 <Bosmon> cindyli, and all - looks like I can\'t resolve gotomeeting.com any more
2017-11-30T15:58:46 <cindyli> oh no
2017-11-30T15:58:50 <Bosmon> I mean, I can resolve it
2017-11-30T15:58:52 <Bosmon> But it just times out
2017-11-30T16:00:27 <Bosmon> I\'d just asked whether, for our production strategy of loading preference sets we would i) construct a new API, or ii) expect scripts to be run by privileged people behind the firewall
2017-11-30T16:00:34 <Bosmon> But presumably someone else has now asked this question for me
2017-11-30T16:03:42 <cindyli> adding those to the pad
2017-11-30T16:04:20 <mrtyler> Bosmon: even if "someone" runs scripts "behind the firewall", we need a mechanism for storing the (secret) data
2017-11-30T16:04:36 <mrtyler> i.e. not a public github repo, not a public docker image
2017-11-30T16:06:35 <cindyli> mrtyler: i think those data should go straight into the production database at their creations
2017-11-30T16:06:53 <mrtyler> cindyli: ok, that sounds like solution i) then?
2017-11-30T16:07:26 <mrtyler> put another way: i don\'t see how to do ii) without storing the data somewhere
2017-11-30T16:08:49 <mrtyler> but with i) and, say, a CRUD app to communicate with an api, maybe everything is dynamic and never needs to be stored outside of the production database
2017-11-30T16:10:38 <cindyli> both i) and ii) are needed, mrtyler, the process is like: GPII cloud provides i) an API for creating keys, it will handle request like giving out 100 new keys meanwhile writing those keys into the database; then, ii) the privileged person runs a script that accesses this API which responses with whatever number of keys this person requests
2017-11-30T16:11:48 <mrtyler> are the "keys" being generated secret? i.e. we must protect them from falling into an attacker\'s hands?
2017-11-30T16:12:30 <mrtyler> i guess they are
2017-11-30T16:12:33 <cindyli> mrtyler: yes, they are secrets.
2017-11-30T16:12:45 <cindyli> that\'s why accessing it needs to be behind the firewall
2017-11-30T16:13:25 <cindyli> unless we have ways for verifying the person\'s identity
2017-11-30T16:14:03 <mrtyler> does the generated key need to "come out of" the system?
2017-11-30T16:14:11 <mrtyler> like does it get written to an rfid card?
2017-11-30T16:14:26 <mrtyler> or are the keys only used internally for oauth or whatever?
2017-11-30T16:14:36 <mrtyler> sorry i\'m still fuzzy on this system
2017-11-30T16:14:46 <cindyli> ya, i believe yes they need to be written to cards
2017-11-30T16:14:55 <mrtyler> and maybe i don\'t need to understand. it\'s unclear what my/ops\'s role is with this part of the project
2017-11-30T16:15:24 <mrtyler> but to me it sounds like this should be handled with a CRUD app, not one-off backend scripts run by privileged users
2017-11-30T16:15:24 <cindyli> it will be clearer when we have a clearer process ;)
2017-11-30T16:15:29 <mrtyler> :)
2017-11-30T16:15:37 <cindyli> i agree
2017-11-30T16:15:44 <amatas_> mrtyler: I\'m also interested on how the system works, in order to set the cloud infrastructure up as secure as possible.
2017-11-30T16:15:59 <cindyli> but as a quick and dirty first step :)
2017-11-30T16:16:06 <cindyli> let\'s see how it goes
2017-11-30T16:16:26 <mrtyler> i\'m happy to try to answer any questions you have about how the cloud infrastructure is set up :)

2017-11-30T17:02:25 <simonjb> cindyli: do we have a security meeting?
2017-11-30T17:02:48 <mrtyler> simonjb: it\'s not on my calendar
2017-11-30T17:02:52 <cindyli> no, simonjb, sandra added it, she said it\'s a recurring meeting every two weeks
2017-11-30T17:02:55 * clown joined the channel
2017-11-30T17:03:20 <simonjb> ok, thanks cindyli
2017-11-30T17:04:26 <cindyli> simonjb: sandra said it\'s next week. not sure why today\'s one is on my calendar.
2017-11-30T17:04:34 <cindyli> mrtyler: you are on the list too

The top-level config file we discussed yesterday is `configs/app.dev.json`

2017-11-30T10:59:02 <kasparnet> Created this https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2730
2017-11-30T10:59:15 <kasparnet> do we have a name of the preference we want to use?
2017-11-30T10:59:29 <kasparnet> in terms of the schema, I guess this should be a boolean value?
2017-11-30T11:08:20 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, boolean value
2017-11-30T11:08:49 <Bosmon> I suggested http://registry.gpii.net/common/speechControl
2017-11-30T11:09:10 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2017-11-30T11:09:20 <kasparnet> cheers Bosmon
2017-11-30T11:09:29 <kasparnet> oh, btw, how is your availability today?
2017-11-30T11:09:37 <kasparnet> I have a meeting with the UI team this afternoon
2017-11-30T11:09:37 <Bosmon> I am around.... except for meetings
2017-11-30T11:09:45 <Bosmon> I have another meeting at the same time as that
2017-11-30T11:10:09 <kasparnet> where I\'ll be walking the through what the new matchmaker (i.e. with effectology) will be able to do
2017-11-30T11:10:18 <kasparnet> so I\'d like to talk it through you at some point
2017-11-30T11:10:27 <kasparnet> once I finish GPII-2730, I\'ll make a list
2017-11-30T11:10:40 <kasparnet> and if you have time after that, it\'d be great to get some input on
2017-11-30T11:10:50 <kasparnet> anyway, I\'ll give you a ping about it later

2017-11-30T11:17:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon, do you know if there are supposed to be other settings in the new NP set with speechControl
2017-11-30T11:18:16 <Bosmon> We may as well put a couple in there just for show
2017-11-30T11:18:26 <Bosmon> I was thinking of forking snapset 3 and replacing one of the settings in that
2017-11-30T11:18:46 <kasparnet> alright, that sounds like a plan

2017-11-30T11:38:50 <kasparnet> dandimitrov, Bosmon: Ok, go the new term here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/568
2017-11-30T11:40:01 <kasparnet> I based it off of https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/567 (my liveness pull), which in hindsight might have been a stupid idea - i figured it made sense due to this having to do with liveness - but on the other hand, since the PCP isn\'t using liveness from the core framework, I guess that wasn\'t needed
2017-11-30T11:40:22 <kasparnet> anyway, let me know if I base it off of master instead
2017-11-30T12:04:50 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-11-30T12:24:33 <dandimitrov> Hi kasparnet, we also believe it would be better to branch it from master as we won\'t be using the liveness functionality
2017-11-30T12:25:54 <dandimitrov> Also, as the liveness branch is WIP, it would be safer not to use it for now

2017-11-30T12:43:14 <dandimitrov> kasparnet, great :)
2017-11-30T12:44:04 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, kaspernet: shall we have this PR merged into master today?
2017-11-30T12:44:25 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes
2017-11-30T12:44:27 <kasparnet> I think Bosmon was planning to do so, yes
2017-11-30T12:44:33 <Bosmon> I will do it within a few minutes if it looks ok to all of you
2017-11-30T12:45:07 <Bosmon> Perhaps you could make a test against your PSP branch and see if it works for your purpose
2017-11-30T12:45:35 <dandimitrov> Yep, I\'ll have it tested right away
2017-11-30T12:50:27 <kasparnet> do you have time to meet relatively soon about the MM phase 2, antrnaig?
2017-11-30T12:50:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet - how soon is relatively soon? : P
2017-11-30T12:50:51 <kasparnet> now
2017-11-30T12:50:53 <kasparnet> :)
2017-11-30T12:50:55 <Bosmon> hah
2017-11-30T12:51:02 <kasparnet> or well, anytime < 3.45
2017-11-30T12:51:06 <Bosmon> I\'m on with the-t-in-rtf1 in theory for the next 10 minutes
2017-11-30T12:51:11 <Bosmon> But I guess I could meet after that
2017-11-30T12:51:14 <kasparnet> 15:45 european time
2017-11-30T12:51:37 <kasparnet> ok cool, I\'ll just be afk for a bit now, but give me a ping when you\'re ready
2017-11-30T13:03:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m trying to fix the issue we talked about yesterday.. I changed it to
2017-11-30T13:03:23 <Justin_o> var value = lisrec.listener.apply(null, [that.returns[that.index], that.options]);
2017-11-30T13:03:36 <Justin_o> but this doesn\'t seem to work with this-ist listeners
2017-11-30T13:03:53 <Justin_o> is there a utility to convert all of these
2017-11-30T13:04:07 <Justin_o> i was looking at fluid.recordToApplicable
2017-11-30T13:04:13 <Justin_o> but it doesn\'t seem to be returning anything
2017-11-30T13:04:24 <Justin_o> sorry, it\'s returning null
2017-11-30T13:05:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the framework should already have called recordToApplicable
2017-11-30T13:05:47 <Bosmon> That\'s why you end up with a thing with an apply method in the first place
2017-11-30T13:06:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah
2017-11-30T13:11:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: perhaps it\'s something wrong with my test

2017-11-30T13:38:17 <Bosmon> I will merge in that case
2017-11-30T13:39:33 <Bosmon> dandimitrov, kasparnet - done

2017-11-30T14:35:27 <kavya> Just checking on Mac installation.. arer you able to setup Gregg\'s PVM
2017-11-30T14:35:44 <gloob> I just installed parallels
2017-11-30T14:35:46 <jhernandez> I\'m still downloading Gregg\'s vm, it failed and I couldn\'t resume the download. So I\'m downloading it again
2017-11-30T14:35:52 <jhernandez> :/
2017-11-30T14:35:58 <gloob> do you have a link?

2017-11-30T14:40:05 <stegru> yes, jhernandez
2017-11-30T14:40:08 <jhernandez> cool
2017-11-30T14:40:24 <stegru> there was nothing wrong with the previous version, but i upgraded yesterday
2017-11-30T14:41:22 <jhernandez> mrtyler: are you saying that I\'m a design pattern?
2017-11-30T14:41:24 <jhernandez> xD
2017-11-30T14:42:09 <mrtyler> hey, just be happy you\'re an interesting design pattern
2017-11-30T14:42:28 <stegru> a pattern that\'s advised against, however
2017-11-30T14:42:34 <mrtyler> i\'m an Abstract Factory :\'(
2017-11-30T14:42:38 <jhernandez> haha
2017-11-30T14:42:56 <mrtyler> stegru is Lazy Initialization
2017-11-30T14:43:05 <stegru> haha! yes!!
2017-11-30T14:43:57 <gloob> Tomorrow design pattern
2017-11-30T14:44:53 <gloob> stegru: one question
2017-11-30T14:45:27 <stegru> yes?
2017-11-30T14:46:03 <gloob> stegru: as you know we have a lot of windows 10 settings (I think this also happens frequently in previous windows version) that we need for applying the settings, or publish a message using a windows call, or logout/login or restart the explorer, so I\'m wondering which is the best strategy to add this common actions to gpii
2017-11-30T14:46:50 <gloob> really bad expression, "we have a lot of windows 10 settings that for apply inmediately we need to:"
2017-11-30T14:47:38 <stegru> hmm
2017-11-30T14:48:03 <stegru> well, how about this strategy: get off IRC and start working on it
2017-11-30T14:48:50 <stegru> seriously though, I was hoping to discover a way of interracting with the windows settings
2017-11-30T14:52:31 <stegru> a windows call may be tricky to do, because usually there\'s more code needed to setup the call (like creating buffers, initialising structures)
2017-11-30T14:53:16 <stegru> sending a message probably do-able.. create a wrapper around PostMessage or SendMessage.
2017-11-30T14:53:55 <stegru> restart explorer - I\'ve done that, it\'s somewhere in here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/132
2017-11-30T14:55:12 <stegru> logout/login - well, that would cause GPII to terminate (also the user might not know the password, if it\'s a public machine), but sometimes restarting explorer (and other things) is enough to simulate the logout
