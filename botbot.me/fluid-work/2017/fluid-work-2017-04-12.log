2017-04-12T18:46:45 <kathy_> oh okay sorry
2017-04-12T18:47:13 <Justin_o> no problem, please let me know when it's up
2017-04-12T18:48:11 <kathy_> it should be up

2017-04-12T19:03:07 <Justin_o> kathy_: perhaps you can look at this fork of the mega menu instead. It's suppose to be responsive out of the box. https://github.com/mandalatv/Accessible-Mega-Menu
2017-04-12T19:03:54 <Justin_o> kathy_: here's a blog post on it http://www.mandalatv.net/2016/06/a-responsive-accessible-adobe-com-mega-menu/

2017-04-12T19:10:25 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2017-04-12T19:10:54 <kathy_> so we should make the moblie toggle thing like that instead?
2017-04-12T19:13:16 <Justin_o> kathy_: you can use that instead of the current accessible mega menu you have, and it should make the thing work automatically for you.. you'll probably want to adjust the styling to look like you want, but it seems pretty close to start.

2017-04-12T19:30:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: I'm looking at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/815#pullrequestreview-32404361
2017-04-12T19:30:34 <Justin_o> I wonder if it would make sense to increase the size of labels or not
2017-04-12T19:31:25 <cindyli> Justin_o: personally i think it doesn't make sense
2017-04-12T19:31:46 <cindyli> as well as fieldset, legend
2017-04-12T19:32:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, so i'm increasing the size of button, fatalist, input, select, textarea
2017-04-12T19:32:12 <cindyli> progress elements are more like indicators instead of inputs
2017-04-12T19:32:13 <Justin_o> :(
2017-04-12T19:32:21 <Justin_o> fatalist was supposed to be datalist
2017-04-12T19:33:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: actually i think datalist isn't needed either
2017-04-12T19:33:13 <cindyli> datalist seems making sense to me
2017-04-12T19:33:16 <cindyli> why
2017-04-12T19:33:17 <Justin_o> lol
2017-04-12T19:33:26 <cindyli> to pick an option
2017-04-12T19:33:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: i'm not sure it's rendered
2017-04-12T19:33:32 <Justin_o> select is
2017-04-12T19:33:35 <Justin_o> and it's on my list
2017-04-12T19:34:09 <cindyli> it's rendered as a predefined input text field, i think
2017-04-12T19:34:42 <cindyli> that's wrong
2017-04-12T19:34:55 <cindyli> it should be a input text field with predefined options
2017-04-12T19:35:13 <Justin_o> cindyli: yep, and the input will get the enhancement
2017-04-12T19:35:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, so the only new items are textarea and select
2017-04-12T19:35:40 <Justin_o> sound alright?
2017-04-12T19:35:43 <cindyli> ok

2017-04-12T20:43:44 <jhung> colinclark or alanharnum: can either of you add in a short description of the collaboration with Bodies in Translation to this wiki page? We'd like to have this updated for the Hewlett meetings in a week's time. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Collaborations
2017-04-12T20:46:13 <colinclark> Do you think it makes sense in the context of Hewlett and FLOE?
2017-04-12T20:46:19 <colinclark> since this isn't directly an OER project?
2017-04-12T20:46:32 <colinclark> I could certain write something brief about the Knowledge Platform
2017-04-12T20:46:41 <colinclark> which will include OERs about Canadian disability art
2017-04-12T20:46:44 <colinclark> so perhaps it's apt
2017-04-12T20:47:18 <jhung> colinclark: that makes more sense.
