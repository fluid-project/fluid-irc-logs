2017-06-05T12:45:46 <Justin_o> alanharn_: i am trying to sign up for a slack account for the SJRK, but i don\'t see any way to contact an admin there.
2017-06-05T12:46:02 <Justin_o> https://sojustrepairit.slack.com
2017-06-05T12:46:21 <Justin_o> There is a note that says "Don\'t have an account on this team yet? Contact the team administrator for an invitation"
2017-06-05T12:46:33 <Justin_o> but i don\'t see any link or way of contacting an admin on that page

2017-06-05T13:24:40 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i was also mentioning that there doesn\'t seem to be a way from the slack page to acutely request an invite... gtirloni gave an example of an invitation system from another team
