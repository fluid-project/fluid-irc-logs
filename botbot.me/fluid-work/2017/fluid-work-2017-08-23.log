2017-08-23T17:07:12 <Bosmon> michelled ??!
2017-08-23T17:09:42 <michelled> well, I think the tests are back to hanging. but at least they are being queued now

2017-08-23T18:14:28 <clown> jhung, here\'s a somewhat lengthy response.
2017-08-23T18:14:46 <clown> 1.  Don\'t use longdesc since there is no "go" action in this case.
2017-08-23T18:15:35 <clown> 2. I don\'t know how well ATs support longdesc.  Likely not well because it isn\'t well handled in accessibility APIs.
2017-08-23T18:19:20 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-23T18:19:39 <clown> 3.  According to the HTML mapping guide, the name of a figure is taken from the caption.
2017-08-23T18:19:59 <clown> 3a.  Here\'s the link:  https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#el-figure
2017-08-23T18:21:00 <clown> 3b.  So, the way to go should be to not use "alt" on the <img>, but supply <figcaption> text.
2017-08-23T18:21:42 <clown> 4.  If you need a description, use aria-describedby
2017-08-23T18:22:05 <clown> 4a: https://w3c.github.io/aria/aria/aria.html#aria-describedby
2017-08-23T18:22:39 * mrtyler has quit
2017-08-23T18:23:12 <clown> 5. if you want the description to toggle between a visible/hidden, use aria-details, along with HTML <details><summary> \xe2\x80\xa6 </summary></details>
2017-08-23T18:23:25 <clown> 5a. https://w3c.github.io/aria/aria/aria.html#aria-details
2017-08-23T18:24:03 <clown> 6. end
2017-08-23T18:24:20 <clown> any questions, jhung?
2017-08-23T18:26:21 * clown brb
2017-08-23T18:28:51 <jhung> clown: ok. I think this is helping a lot. Let me see if I can make up an example\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-08-23T18:28:58 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-08-23T18:32:23 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-23T18:32:28 <jhung> So if I had a screen capture of UI Options. The caption delivers information more relevant to the context, like: "Figure 1: UI Options allows users to personalize interfaces to fit their needs and preferences.". The aria-describedby would be more literal like: "An image of a webpage with a horizontal area divided into panels \xe2\x80\xa6"
2017-08-23T18:32:49 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-23T18:33:34 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-23T18:36:01 <jhung> We could also make a toggle for the description using the straregy in point 5. Would it be bad to put the more literal description in a <p id="foo"> </p> in the <figcaption> and put aria-describedby="foo" on the image clown?
2017-08-23T18:37:44 <jhung> Actually clown, here\'s a more specific example: https://github.com/dayotte/floeproject.org/blob/FLOE-528/news/2017-08-23-self-assessment-toolkit.html#L99
2017-08-23T18:39:50 <jhung> You can see there is a caption and a long alt-text. In this case the alt text should go into a new element (like a <p> or <summary>), and aria-describedby used to point to that new element.
2017-08-23T18:48:43 <clown> jhung, I\'m catching up, and helping cindyli at the same time.  "One moment, please".
2017-08-23T18:50:51 <jhung> no problem clown. Take your time.

2017-08-23T19:18:09 <clown> jhung, I\'ve taken a look at the accessibility tree that example generates, and it\'s not terrible, but it\'s kind of confusing.
2017-08-23T19:19:14 <clown> The <img> is actually an image link, and that link gets its name from the img\'s alt text.
2017-08-23T19:20:10 <clown> So:  you have a figure with its name taken from the figure caption, a link with a looong name, taken from the alt text, and an image also with the same loooong name as the link.
2017-08-23T19:22:53 <clown> I\'m inclined to agree with you:  ditch the alt text (set it to the empty string), and make that text available via <details><summary> for visual usesrs, and use aria-details (not aria-describedby) for AT users.
2017-08-23T19:23:56 <clown> I"m not sure where you put the <details><summary>.  Just below the figure, perhaps?
2017-08-23T19:27:04 <clown> Also, since there is an image link, it\'s keyboard navigable:  Tabbing through the page, lands you on the link (<a href="\xe2\x80\xa6">).
2017-08-23T19:27:47 <clown> I would have expected to land on the figure\xe2\x80\xa6  hmmmm\xe2\x80\xa6.
2017-08-23T19:31:52 <clown> Would if be better to set tabindex="0" on the <figure>, and tabindex="-1" on the <a>?  But, then you wouldn\'t be able to activate the link
2017-08-23T19:33:09 <michelled> Bosmon: indeed. I\'m also noticing that the tests aren\'t adding up correctly now. meaning it reports the number of unit tests separately from the number of integration tests instead of reporting the total number of tests
2017-08-23T19:34:33 <danayo> clown, jhung: jumping in here - you mean you wouldn\'t be able to open the figure link with the keyboard, yes? I think that\'s problematic - we want KB user to be able to view the larger image if desired
2017-08-23T19:40:57 <clown> danayo:  yes, that was my worry.
2017-08-23T19:42:28 <clown> so, I take back the idea of making the figure the tab navigation thing.
2017-08-23T19:49:17 <jhung> clown, danayo: so I guess the solution here is to leave the alt text empty, Put a <details><summary> block below (or somewhere) on the page and use aria-details.
2017-08-23T19:50:07 <clown> yes, jhung.
2017-08-23T19:50:41 <jhung> We could hide the details the same way we hide the skip links - by using CSS and put that details block in the tab order.
2017-08-23T19:51:06 <clown> but, I\'m wondering then what the name of the link should be.  Probably something like "larger view of this image".
2017-08-23T19:51:30 <clown> jhung, the details/summary is automtically hidden by the browser.
2017-08-23T19:51:41 <jhung> ah ok clown.
2017-08-23T19:52:09 <clown> that\'s one of its nice features:  it\'s shows up as a "twiddle triangle".
2017-08-23T19:52:14 <clown> if you know what I mean by that.
2017-08-23T19:53:20 <jhung> clown, that\'s great. I\'ll work with danayo to get this implemented for this particular example.
2017-08-23T19:53:32 <clown> documentation and examples here:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details
2017-08-23T19:54:17 <danayo> thanks clown & jhung
2017-08-23T19:55:01 <clown> you\'re most welcome, danayo
2017-08-23T19:56:25 <danayo> clown jhung so I\'m thinking we\'d want the twiddle triangle to show up next to the figure caption?
2017-08-23T19:57:22 <jhung> danayo: Yes. Maybe right after the caption?
2017-08-23T20:00:12 <jhung> danayo: I\'ll make the changes in my own branch, and I\'ll submit a pull request to your branch so you can merge it into your code. Then this will automatically update the pull request that\'s already there under the Fluid Project repository. Man, that\'s confusing. :D
2017-08-23T20:03:01 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-08-23T20:04:12 <danayo> ok jhung, I was just trying to see if I could make it work - I\'ll keep trying and then compare to what you\'ve got
2017-08-23T20:05:02 <jhung> danayo: in that case I\'ll leave you to it. I can help review of course. :)
2017-08-23T20:06:27 <clown> jhung, danayo, Also the twiddle triangle is automatically tab-focusable.
2017-08-23T20:07:23 <danayo> ah, nice clown. i just got it working. the order of figure caption / details / summary had me confused for a bit
2017-08-23T20:08:45 <danayo> jhung, clown: should I still provide some brief al-text ?
2017-08-23T20:10:03 <jhung> danayo: yes. It should describe where that link will take someone. So maybe "See larger version of this image"?
2017-08-23T20:10:22 <danayo> right, ok jhung, thanks
2017-08-23T20:10:26 <jhung> Or "Go to larger version of this image".
2017-08-23T20:10:47 * javjarfer_ joined the channel
2017-08-23T20:10:48 <danayo> maybe "open larger version of this image"?

2017-08-23T20:11:00 <danayo> jhung!!
2017-08-23T20:11:13 <jhung> lol
2017-08-23T20:12:38 <jhung> "open" may not be the appropriate term since we\'re technically not opening anything (i.e. it\'s not a new tab nor does it spawn an external viewer).
2017-08-23T20:12:42 <jhung> ^danayo
2017-08-23T20:14:18 * javjarfer has quit
2017-08-23T20:14:32 <danayo> jhung: hmmm...it does feel like something gets opened though, I guess because it requires using the back button in the browser to get back - I guess it comes back to that question of needing to provide a way to "close" the image ...
2017-08-23T20:20:36 <jhung> danayo: I think we may need a second opinion on that. "Open" to me implies something different.
2017-08-23T20:23:01 <danayo> that\'s fine jhung, I\'m happy to use "see" or "view" instead

2017-08-23T20:23:39 <danayo> jhung i have a question about how to use aria-details - do you have a minute?
2017-08-23T20:25:18 <jhung> but what you bring up is a very interesting point though. Lightboxes have become so prevalent that the once common practice of linking to larger images could actually be more confusing danayo.
2017-08-23T20:28:00 <danayo> i agree jhung, there does seem to be an expectation to have a close button. so it gets into the question of thumbnails and accessibility etc that we were discussing recently

2017-08-23T14:11:07 <stegru> just been speaking with sandra, and she says you\'re waiting for me to do something - what is it exactly, and how urgent is it?
2017-08-23T14:12:51 * clown joined the channel
2017-08-23T14:15:00 <cindyli> stegru: when sandra followed up with me, I said the implementation for the access requester is put on hold because we don\'t have enough time for it to meet the end of oct timeline, and it also depends on your work with gpii-service
2017-08-23T14:15:30 <stegru> ah yes that\'s what i thought.. thanks cindyli
2017-08-23T14:15:41 <stegru> i thought there was something that i had missed
2017-08-23T14:15:45 <cindyli> it\'s not urgent since we think the access requester is not planned for the first pass on PCP
2017-08-23T14:16:00 <cindyli> nah, i think that is it
2017-08-23T14:17:58 <stegru> i\'m working on the service->gpii communications at the moment.. (it\'s done enough to make a PR soon)...
2017-08-23T14:18:14 <stegru> you asked for a test for it the other day, so here it is...
2017-08-23T14:19:14 <stegru> cindyli: https://github.com/stegru/gpii-service/blob/GPII-2338/tests/gpii-pipe-test.js#L317

2017-08-23T14:27:13 <cindyli> reading..
2017-08-23T14:36:05 <cindyli> stegru: i think it\'s straightforward. if the pipe read/write code should be on the window platform but the access requester is intended to be useful across platforms, i\'m thinking I probably should create placeholder subcomponent on the access requester to be in charge of input read and output write, then we write actual pipe code in the windows repo
2017-08-23T14:36:38 <stegru> yes, that was also my thought cindyli
2017-08-23T14:37:05 <cindyli> cool. we can talk about these things in detail when it comes to implement the access reqeuster. thanks, stegru
2017-08-23T14:37:11 <stegru> yep

2017-08-23T15:56:05 <clown> jhung, yes?
2017-08-23T15:56:17 * clown runs and hides
2017-08-23T15:56:44 <jhung> lol I think you know what
2017-08-23T15:56:48 <jhung> \'s coming.

2017-08-23T15:57:32 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-23T15:57:43 <jhung> clown: currently we use a <figure><img alt="\xe2\x80\xa6"></img><figcaption></figcaption></figure> pattern for images in many of our websites.
2017-08-23T15:57:49 <clown> actually I don\'t, jhung.  Note, though, the GPII arch meeting starts in 3 min.
2017-08-23T15:58:03 <jhung> ok
2017-08-23T15:58:24 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-23T15:58:26 <clown> but, keep typing.  I\'ll look it over and think about it as I can.
2017-08-23T15:58:26 <jhung> clown: would adding a longdesc to the <img ..> in this case be redundant?
2017-08-23T15:58:30 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-23T16:00:34 <clown> jhung:  prior question: longdesc is a link.  Is the intent of the UX for users to go to another page or another part of the current page for the description text?  In other words, is the context switch (to another place) necessary?
2017-08-23T16:02:15 <jhung> clown: ah. The caption is usually right above or below the image, so there\'s no context switching usually.
2017-08-23T16:02:40 <jhung> Do we know how well supported longdesc is with current ATs clown?

2017-08-23T16:51:05 <Justin_o> simonjb, danayo: I\'ve sent you both some variations on the loading indicator for UIO+. Hopefully you get it, the attachments added up to about 14MB. Please let me know if you don\'t get it, and thanks for the help looking at them.
2017-08-23T16:54:46 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o, I will take a look
2017-08-23T16:55:10 <simonjb> welcome ussjoin :)
2017-08-23T16:55:19 <ussjoin> Hi!

2017-08-23T16:55:47 <simonjb> ussjoin, cindyli: would a time work for you both to get together today for a chat?
2017-08-23T16:56:21 <ussjoin> I\'m free any time today other than 11-11:30AM (PDT). So lmk what works best for you.
2017-08-23T16:57:14 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2017-08-23T16:58:31 <Bosmon> michelled - as far as I can see the code within node-jqunit for reporting to the OS on zero fixtures is correct: https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqunit/blob/master/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L181
2017-08-23T16:58:40 <Bosmon> So there must be some problem with how the tests are being invoked by CI
2017-08-23T16:59:42 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2017-08-23T16:59:43 <Bosmon> Here it is
2017-08-23T16:59:49 <Bosmon> You have a custom reporter here:
2017-08-23T16:59:57 <Bosmon> https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2092/tests.js#L15
2017-08-23T16:59:58 <Bosmon> Very odd
2017-08-23T17:01:21 <michelled> Bosmon: I think kasparnet put that in so that the tests exit - otherwise they were just hanging. kasparnet, am I remembering correctly?
2017-08-23T17:01:48 <Bosmon> Well it\'s very strange, since the corresponding line in jqUnit-node does exactly the same thing
2017-08-23T17:01:50 <kasparnet> yes, that\'s correct michelled
2017-08-23T17:02:22 <Bosmon> Perhaps they are sensitive to the process.stdout.write hack that perhaps isn\'t necessary any more?
2017-08-23T17:02:45 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-08-23T17:02:57 <Bosmon> But I\'d try removing this line and see what happens
2017-08-23T17:03:10 <michelled> ok, thx
2017-08-23T17:03:44 <Bosmon> Or perhaps there is a bug in process.stdout.write in electron?
2017-08-23T17:03:45 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqunit/blob/master/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L194
2017-08-23T17:04:01 <Bosmon> Another thing you can try is to monkey-patch this line in node-jqunit to remove that layer of wrapping
2017-08-23T17:05:27 <Bosmon> It seems that this bug was fixed in node 0.12
2017-08-23T17:05:31 <cindyli> ussjoin, simonjb, anytime is good for me
2017-08-23T17:05:38 <michelled> huh, it looks like taking that line out is running the tests! I\'m not sure yet if they all pass or not
2017-08-23T17:05:51 <Bosmon> So we should be able to remove this if it is what is causing problems on electron
