2017-08-16T18:50:27 <grrrero> Hi jhung, for adding the link to the feedback archive to the site, I can add this as part of the current theme in its navigation right?
2017-08-16T18:51:51 <jhung> grrrero: Yep. Although that link can go pretty much anywhere you want (i.e. you could even put it in a user's profile page so it appears there).

2017-08-16T10:48:39 <kasparnet> hey dude
2017-08-16T10:48:51 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-08-16T10:49:03 <kasparnet> I\'m out atm, but will be home and back in front of my computer in ~1hr
2017-08-16T10:49:14 <kasparnet> but I got time for a couple of quick questions now javjarfer
2017-08-16T10:50:30 <javjarfer> kasparnet, oh! no problem, I\'m going to paste it, but there is no hurry. Do you know to which thing this error could be related? "Error when retrieving preferences: Raw preferences server: Preferences missing for "
2017-08-16T10:51:23 <javjarfer> It says that for every user
2017-08-16T10:52:35 * kasparnet has quit
2017-08-16T11:56:20 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-08-16T11:57:03 <kasparnet> javjarfer: it sounds like that path used by the preferences server is pointing to a path with no users
2017-08-16T11:57:27 <kasparnet> javjarfer: let me just see if there is a good place to see the path
2017-08-16T11:58:24 <javjarfer> kasparnet, okay! Thanks, I have leave all like it was, because it \'started to non-working\' even with two checkout to working commits
2017-08-16T11:58:38 <javjarfer> so I thought something might be corrupted, and was a bug
2017-08-16T12:08:34 <kasparnet> javjarfer: so is it still broken for you from a clean checkout?
2017-08-16T12:08:57 <kasparnet> would you by any chance have anything in the NODE_ENV environment variable?
2017-08-16T12:14:48 <javjarfer> kasparnet, yes, not from a \'clean\' checkout
2017-08-16T12:15:04 <javjarfer> I just went back to a stable version, and all still happening
2017-08-16T12:16:10 <javjarfer> I didn\'t want to do a clean checkout and install all the modules because I will for sure clean the corrupted state
2017-08-16T12:16:18 <javjarfer> and then lost the issue
2017-08-16T12:22:22 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2017-08-16T12:22:30 <kasparnet> is NODE_ENV set?
2017-08-16T12:22:37 <kasparnet> (ie. echo $NODE_ENV)

2017-08-16T12:48:23 <javjarfer> NODE_ENV was not set, but I have tested something, if executed from a new shell, all works correctly
2017-08-16T12:48:40 <javjarfer> Is possible that the shell environment has been corrupted?

2017-08-16T13:25:23 <kasparnet> hmm

2017-08-16T13:26:12 <kasparnet> if there is nothing there, I\'m not sure what it could be
2017-08-16T13:28:58 <javjarfer> okay, sorry one second, translating to awful cmd

2017-08-16T13:55:10 <kasparne_> hello Justin_o
2017-08-16T13:55:54 <Justin_o> kasparne_: I\'ve responded to your code review comments. I\'ve made some changes and left some replies
2017-08-16T13:57:31 <javjarfer> kasparne_, this is really weird them...
2017-08-16T13:58:35 <javjarfer> I also wanted your help for tracing something that happened me the other day, I created a new common term, and without including support for it, I used it in one user preferences
2017-08-16T13:58:36 * kasparnet has quit
2017-08-16T13:59:32 <javjarfer> the common term was "http://registry.gpii.net/common/wallpaper", and for my surprise, it triggers the narrator
2017-08-16T13:59:42 <kasparne_> haha
2017-08-16T13:59:50 <kasparne_> that is pretty surprising
2017-08-16T14:00:06 <javjarfer> hahaha yes, I really wondered what was doing with my life
2017-08-16T14:00:14 <kasparne_> hahaha
2017-08-16T14:00:22 <kasparne_> Justin_o: cool - thanks for the quick response time... I gotta look into GPII-2535 first, but then I\'ll get back to you
2017-08-16T14:00:41 <javjarfer> you know, I think I understand the system now, and after a second, I trigger the narrator with one unsupported setting
2017-08-16T14:00:55 <kasparne_> hehehe, yeah
2017-08-16T14:01:08 <kasparne_> javjarfer: I\'m not really sure what could be the cause of it... are there other terms in the preferences set?
2017-08-16T14:01:16 <kasparne_> or any kind of mentioning of the narrator?
2017-08-16T14:01:56 <Justin_o> kasparne_: thanks, there are two main questions i have, 1) should i remove org.chrome.cloud4chrome and org.mozilla.cloud4firefox as well. 2) i removed the entry from the installedSolutions.json but it doesn\'t seem to work in windows any more.
2017-08-16T14:02:11 * avtar joined the channel
2017-08-16T14:02:45 <javjarfer> kasparne_, nothing at all, I can paste it in a pastebin
2017-08-16T14:03:58 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-08-16T14:07:22 <javjarfer> there you have it, https://pastebin.com/8v6j9FF8
2017-08-16T14:12:58 <kasparne_> Justin_o: 1) yes, cloud4chrome should go ... Do you have cloud4firefox in any other place than test cases?
2017-08-16T14:13:35 <kasparne_> Justin_o: ok... looking at all the instances of cloud4chrome, it might not be as straight forward as I thought
2017-08-16T14:13:38 * Bosmon joined the channel
2017-08-16T14:13:43 <kasparne_> se
2017-08-16T14:13:45 <kasparne_> sec*
2017-08-16T14:15:13 <Justin_o> kasparne_: i only see references for cloud4firefox under test directories.
2017-08-16T14:15:27 <Justin_o> kasparne_: yah, they seemed to be used for browserChannel tests
2017-08-16T14:19:57 <kasparne_> Justin_o: I didn\'t realize the chrome one was references as extensively as it is in the codebase
2017-08-16T14:20:22 <kasparne_> I\'m wondering if we _should_ just remove it in a separate pull request
2017-08-16T14:20:34 <kasparne_> to keep your\'s cleaner
2017-08-16T14:20:39 <kasparne_> probably that makes sense
2017-08-16T14:21:12 <Justin_o> kasparne_: i pulled out the com.ilunion.cloud4chrome already
2017-08-16T14:21:19 <kasparne_> ah great
2017-08-16T14:21:40 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay, so i\'ll leave that change and not worry about the rest yet
2017-08-16T14:21:46 <kasparne_> that\'d be great
2017-08-16T14:21:49 <Justin_o> cool
2017-08-16T14:22:02 <kasparne_> in terms of 2) yes, after removal it will be reported as not installed... This will prevent us from trying to set it on any system where GPII has just been installed
2017-08-16T14:22:18 <kasparne_> so to get it working, one would manually add it to the file
2017-08-16T14:22:33 <kasparne_> or just run the system with the dynamic device reporter
2017-08-16T14:23:05 <kasparne_> (which should be - and will become - the default for non-developers running the system)
2017-08-16T14:23:30 <kasparne_> so generally, we only have built in solutions added to installedSOlutions.json, to ensure that things are working on a fresh windows box
2017-08-16T14:24:14 <kasparne_> javjarfer: so the system is able to translate from application specific settings to common terms, and onwards to application settings for another application
2017-08-16T14:25:06 <kasparne_> so one thing that could be happening is that one of the preferences (eg. ColorPrevalence) is translated into some common term, and then the system sees it matches a narrator setting and decides to run that
2017-08-16T14:25:25 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay i\'m going to test that manually adding it to the file works, but otherwise GPII-2501 should be ready for review again. Thanks.
2017-08-16T14:25:27 <kasparne_> does it still launch narrator if you remove the wallpaper
2017-08-16T14:25:42 <kasparne_> awesome, cheers Justin_o

2017-08-16T15:06:53 <jhung> gtirloni: do you know if the Our Doors are Open site is using CI-Travis to pull changes from the wp-a11y theme? I don\'t recall how that site is configured.
2017-08-16T15:08:32 <gtirloni> jhung: doesn\'t seem like it is. should i set up it just like the others?
2017-08-16T15:10:00 <jhung> gtirloni: no. I was just curious. I\'m trying to document all the different WP projects we have currently.
2017-08-16T15:10:29 <gtirloni> ok. the websites configured in CI are defined here: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/tree/master/jenkins_jobs (website-* files)
2017-08-16T15:10:29 <jhung> gtirloni: also changes were made using the WP theme editor, so adding CI at this point will be trouble.
2017-08-16T15:11:00 <jhung> awesome thanks gtirloni.
2017-08-16T15:11:04 <gtirloni> np
2017-08-16T15:14:46 <Justin_o> kasparne_: yes, seems that manually changing the file works. So, yes good for more review.
