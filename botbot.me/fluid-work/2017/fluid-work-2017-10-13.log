2017-10-13T11:00:44 <javjarfer> stegru, ouch didn't saw this
2017-10-13T11:00:55 <javjarfer> did you saw my messages from yesterday?
2017-10-13T11:01:03 <stegru> no?
2017-10-13T11:01:13 <stegru> yes
2017-10-13T11:01:51 <stegru> i'm looking into it now, but don't expect anything to come out of it
2017-10-13T11:02:16 <javjarfer> oh... sad news, then I think I should go back to that list
2017-10-13T11:05:59 <stegru> yes, don't wait for me
2017-10-13T11:08:37 <javjarfer> okay, ping me if you don't mind, if something great appears that could unify this
2017-10-13T11:09:34 <jhernandez> Bosmon: bonjour
2017-10-13T11:10:21 <jhernandez> can please take a look at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2644?
2017-10-13T11:11:11 <jhernandez> apparently there is some interest in having such thing ASAP
2017-10-13T11:15:37 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-10-13T11:15:52 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-10-13T11:20:10 <Bosmon> jhernandez - sure - this is an issue for the Astea team
2017-10-13T11:20:13 <Bosmon> georgitodorov ^
2017-10-13T11:20:45 <Bosmon> But we have a big problem in that when we deploy with memory, the snapsets will not have names any more
2017-10-13T11:20:53 <jhernandez> exactly
2017-10-13T11:21:00 <Bosmon> Anyway, at least we are at the stage where we can start to honestly grapple with real UX issues
2017-10-13T11:21:27 <jhernandez> yes
2017-10-13T11:22:13 <jhernandez> we can think about it when psp with memory goes live

2017-10-13T11:48:55 <the-t-in-rtf> please tell me we're also going to use the term psp memory stick somehow.
2017-10-13T11:49:06 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, as long as we're confusing people, might as well go for it.
2017-10-13T11:58:26 * yuriy joined the channel
2017-10-13T12:19:30 <yuriy> Bosmon, I thought we wanted to remove this menu item (Keyed in with ...) altogether from the non-dev build, because it could indicate the name of the user somehow
2017-10-13T12:25:51 * dandimitrov has left the channel
2017-10-13T12:26:23 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-10-13T12:27:21 <Bosmon> yuriy - that's correct
2017-10-13T12:27:26 <Bosmon> Unfortunately we live in confusing times
2017-10-13T12:27:34 <Bosmon> We have received a user report that suggests that they want it back
2017-10-13T12:28:49 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-10-13T12:30:08 <yuriy> I see
2017-10-13T12:31:43 <yuriy> so, I guess this needs to be modified in the API first, is this correct jhernandez?
2017-10-13T12:32:09 <yuriy> I saw you discussed a couple of options in the ticket
2017-10-13T12:33:20 <yuriy> or rather one option
2017-10-13T12:33:39 <jhernandez> yuriy: right, if we include the user friendly name inside the pref sets it needs to be passed through the API
2017-10-13T12:34:08 <yuriy> ok, thanks
