2017-03-22T09:31:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> @amatas, did you make the new 0.4.7 Windows VM?
2017-03-22T09:31:58 <the-t-in-rtf1> Just wondering what the differences are.

2017-03-22T10:58:11 <the-t-in-rtf1> I just confirmed the new version still requires manual intervention to run browser tests: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2341
2017-03-22T10:58:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> Edge is also still not working.
2017-03-22T10:58:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> You mentioned that you were working on that?
2017-03-22T10:58:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> (The UAC stuff)
2017-03-22T11:11:21 * noveens joined the channel
2017-03-22T11:14:18 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf1, right, I\'m working on that
2017-03-22T11:15:05 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf1, the CI is building the VMs: https://gitlab.com/amatas/packer-win/pipelines/7158697
2017-03-22T11:16:09 <amatas> all the Windows flavors have the same features
2017-03-22T11:18:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> Cool.  Please let me know on the ticket when you have a VM ready to test where IE is usable out of the box.
2017-03-22T11:18:31 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-03-22T11:18:42 <amatas> sure
2017-03-22T11:18:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> (Edge is a bit less important, as we have nothing that can run tests on it)
2017-03-22T11:18:48 * kasparne_ has quit
2017-03-22T11:19:15 <amatas> there is a trick if you want to test it before the new release
2017-03-22T11:19:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> go on\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-03-22T11:19:48 <amatas> try this script and reload the vm: https://gitlab.com/amatas/packer-win/blob/gitlab-ci/scripts/enableUAC.bat
2017-03-22T11:20:20 <amatas> after that you should able to launch edge browser
2017-03-22T11:22:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can wait.
2017-03-22T11:23:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> Like I said, I have nothing that can drive those tests at the moment.
2017-03-22T11:23:22 * kasparnet has quit
2017-03-22T11:25:07 <amatas> ok, I\'ll let you know when the VMs are ready
2017-03-22T11:27:13 <the-t-in-rtf1> If anyone is interested (Hi, @Bosmon), here\'s the issue to watch for Testem adding support for Edge: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2344
2017-03-22T11:27:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> shoot
2017-03-22T11:27:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/996
2017-03-22T11:27:24 <the-t-in-rtf1> There\'s the ACTUAL issue.
2017-03-22T11:28:11 <the-t-in-rtf1> long term it may be that we need to use the webdriver API for Edge testing.
2017-03-22T11:28:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> There are better options there, mainly I need to add a harness to launch the IE and Edge selenium servers and test those.
2017-03-22T11:28:41 <the-t-in-rtf1> Which I will be able to do now thanks to your lovely VMs.
2017-03-22T11:33:24 <amatas> :) awesome
2017-03-22T11:45:37 <the-t-in-rtf1> For anyone interested, here is the monstrously complex list of what works and doesn\'t re: Edge and the WebDriver API: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webdriver-commands
2017-03-22T11:46:23 <the-t-in-rtf1> Unless we come up with other options, it may be a while before we have any real ability to run automated Edge tests.

2017-03-22T15:56:38 <jhung> simonjb: I forgot to mention that I have some clay soil for you tomorrow. It\'ll have a mix of organics in it. It was also dug up from an area near some cedars, which may (or may not) affect your results. I think cedars by nature increase pH of soil over time.
2017-03-22T15:57:00 <jhung> *increase pH = increase acidity
2017-03-22T15:57:58 <simonjb> thanks jhung!
2017-03-22T15:58:57 <gtirloni> decrease pH = increase acidity :P
2017-03-22T15:59:07 <jhung> simonjb: no prob.
2017-03-22T15:59:56 <jhung> gtirloni: chemistry was not my thing. I was "that guy" who shut down a lab because he wasn\'t listening to instructions and accidentally created chlorine gas by mixing bleach and vinegar. :P
2017-03-22T16:00:26 <jhung> after it was written in large letters on a black board of course...
2017-03-22T16:00:36 <gtirloni> lol
