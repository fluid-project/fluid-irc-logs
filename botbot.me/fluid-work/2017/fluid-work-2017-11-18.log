2017-11-18T22:33:52 <chlorophilia> Hi @bosmon \xe2\x80\x94could I have your name to add to the credits on the Bio Galiano website? If anyone helped you I could add their names too. And I will add a credit for Inclusive Design Institute.
2017-11-18T22:41:23 <Bosmon> Hey there chlorophilia - this is me - http://ponder.org.uk/
2017-11-18T22:41:47 <Bosmon> I imagine that Colin might prefer you instead cited the "Inclusive Design Research Center" but I am not completely au fait with these niceties
2017-11-18T22:42:06 <Bosmon> But we haven\'t actually done anything yet, no need to cite us until we\'ve produced something actually useful :)
2017-11-18T22:43:52 <Bosmon> I should have some time to work on some tweaks tomorrow ....
2017-11-18T22:46:26 <chlorophilia> @bosmon, I am so enamored with this bagetelle you have no idea\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-11-18T22:47:14 <Bosmon> heh heh heh.....
2017-11-18T22:47:19 <Bosmon> Well, we ain\'t seen nothing yet :)
2017-11-18T22:47:44 <Bosmon> My honest aim is for this to become something STUPENDOUS .....
2017-11-18T22:47:47 <Bosmon> But let\'s see : P
2017-11-18T22:47:50 <chlorophilia> I just spent the afternoon putting together another graph (after the template of the spider graph), and it\xe2\x80\x99s not working. I wonder if there are too many nodes. Thinking that for all the time I put into it it may be better to adapt what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing to display information for all the various groups. If it would be possible to load the graph at a particular frame of reference?
2017-11-18T22:48:15 <Bosmon> Yes, we\'ll certainly put all the groups in
2017-11-18T22:48:17 <chlorophilia> The graph i tried to create today was for Lepidoptera
2017-11-18T22:48:19 <chlorophilia> 90 spp
2017-11-18T22:48:23 <Bosmon> And we\'ll do cunning stuff
2017-11-18T22:48:33 <Bosmon> Like push the current frame into the URL so that they can become linkable
2017-11-18T22:48:36 <chlorophilia> I am so giddy hahaha
2017-11-18T22:48:38 <Bosmon> As with Google maps, etc.
2017-11-18T22:48:51 <chlorophilia> I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste time, then, continuing to code these mini graphs manually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think...
2017-11-18T22:49:15 <Bosmon> Well, every visualisation is an object lesson
2017-11-18T22:49:31 <Bosmon> Certainly, in terms of revealing what is a useful focus of interest and a plausible way of looking at it
2017-11-18T22:49:38 <chlorophilia> The main thing is.. it takes so long to manually add all the URLs and group the names, etc
2017-11-18T22:49:44 <Bosmon> Yes, sure
2017-11-18T22:49:56 <Bosmon> It must already have taken you a million years just to compile the Numbers spreadsheet
2017-11-18T22:51:04 <Bosmon> It\'s pretty interesting how the office applications of the 90s, and perhaps their web equivalents, remain the world\'s only practical venue for "user programming"
2017-11-18T22:51:21 <Bosmon> Despite all the hoohaa about enabling citizen science etc : P
2017-11-18T22:51:38 <chlorophilia> hahahaha\xe2\x80\xa6 yes, that spreadsheet has taken forever
2017-11-18T22:52:01 <Bosmon> So we\'re going to have to come up with a workflow that, for the time being, allows you to remain centred on these office tools
2017-11-18T22:52:10 <chlorophilia> I should start working on it again\xe2\x80\xa6 I noticed from your visualization, actually, that some of the fields weren\xe2\x80\x99t complete. I am probably overlooking a lot more...
2017-11-18T22:52:39 <chlorophilia> \xe2\x80\x98fraid so :/
2017-11-18T22:52:42 <Bosmon> This was my previous foray into public access scholarship - http://darwin-online.org.uk/
2017-11-18T22:52:49 <Bosmon> More than a decade ago now
2017-11-18T22:52:59 <chlorophilia> \xe2\x80\xa6and that smiley\xe2\x80\xa6 isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the sense i intended
2017-11-18T22:53:11 <Bosmon> Which is also structured so it may be maintained by a solitary troll armed only with a Microsoft Access database
2017-11-18T22:53:22 <Bosmon> Which from time to time is exported to an absolutely sodding gigantic csv file
2017-11-18T22:53:37 <Bosmon> 11 years later, the state of the art remains exactly where it was :)
2017-11-18T22:53:57 <chlorophilia> awesome
2017-11-18T22:54:18 <Bosmon> I was looking into what facilities Numbers had that might enable it to make uploads automatically, etc.
2017-11-18T22:54:24 <Bosmon> But it seems this is all mediated by "Applescript" : P
2017-11-18T22:54:37 <Bosmon> With which my last dabbling was more than 20 years ago ....
2017-11-18T22:54:44 <Bosmon> But I imagine that hasn\'t moved on much either :)
2017-11-18T22:54:56 <chlorophilia> hahaha probably not.
2017-11-18T22:55:09 <Bosmon> Have you experimented with any scripting in your database?
2017-11-18T22:55:16 <Bosmon> Does it interact with anything else?
2017-11-18T22:55:24 <Bosmon> I meant to say.... spreadsheet
2017-11-18T23:01:23 <chlorophilia> ooops
2017-11-18T23:01:31 <chlorophilia> No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t
2017-11-18T23:02:16 <chlorophilia> I often chastise myself for not being more savvy that way, but I also chastise myself for not working hard enough on my taxonomy...
2017-11-18T23:13:44 <Bosmon> Can you think of how any tool might work that could make the task easier for you?#
2017-11-18T23:15:41 <chlorophilia> I actually took the time to write out my entire workflow
2017-11-18T23:15:50 <chlorophilia> last year...
2017-11-18T23:15:59 <Bosmon> cool
2017-11-18T23:16:43 <chlorophilia> as I had mentioned (during my presentation I think), many of the tasks have actually proven quite purposeful to get my acquainted with the data, to catch errors, etc. My greatest fear with a script is for the curation to become overly automated
2017-11-18T23:16:53 <chlorophilia> me*
2017-11-18T23:17:05 * amatas has quit
2017-11-18T23:17:26 <chlorophilia> I think that the most useful task would be fetching authorities from key repositories for certain groups, like Mycobank, the Plant List, etc
2017-11-18T23:18:41 <chlorophilia> let me think more about it\xe2\x80\xa6 i don\xe2\x80\x99t think i need subject you to my write-up, unless you wanted more insight. My flow has changed a little in the last while, since I\xe2\x80\x99ve added new columns and began keeping track of who found what and when, etc
2017-11-18T23:23:20 <Bosmon> No, I\'d love to see the writeup
2017-11-18T23:24:05 <Bosmon> Are there any features specifically in Numbers that make the task easier than it would be with a generic spreadsheet like Excel or Google Sheets, or do you use it mainly for general ergonomics, or out of habit?
2017-11-18T23:25:51 <chlorophilia> oh, no it just came about when my Thinkpad died and I finally decided to abandon IBM, now Lenovo
2017-11-18T23:26:09 <chlorophilia> I invested in a Mac and it came along with the Mac software...
2017-11-18T23:26:15 <chlorophilia> I now have Excel...
2017-11-18T23:26:27 <chlorophilia> have been alternating a bit, depending on the project
2017-11-18T23:26:54 <chlorophilia> I will get the write-up online, on a Google doc
2017-11-18T23:27:03 <Bosmon> Oh wow
2017-11-18T23:27:09 <Bosmon> I just ordered one of these :)
2017-11-18T23:27:17 <chlorophilia> ordered?
2017-11-18T23:27:27 <Bosmon> https://www3.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-25/ThinkPad-25/p/22TP2TTTP25
2017-11-18T23:27:30 <chlorophilia> hahahahaha
2017-11-18T23:27:54 <Bosmon> If only it was truly 25 years retro
2017-11-18T23:28:01 <Bosmon> Rather than about merely 10ish years retro
2017-11-18T23:28:10 <Bosmon> it\'s got a keyboard which looks pretty similar to the one on my T42
2017-11-18T23:28:17 <chlorophilia> if they\xe2\x80\x99ve built it like they used it, that thing will be bomb-proof
2017-11-18T23:28:21 <chlorophilia> used to*
2017-11-18T23:28:41 <Bosmon> Hahaha yes, quite
2017-11-18T23:28:52 <chlorophilia> mine was run over by a car, and survived a leap from a freight train
2017-11-18T23:28:53 <Bosmon> I was wondering what you meant when you said your "Thinkpad died" : P
2017-11-18T23:28:56 <Bosmon> hahaha
2017-11-18T23:29:16 <Bosmon> My main "work travel machine" is still an X61T
2017-11-18T23:29:27 <Bosmon> But perhaps this T25 can change that
2017-11-18T23:29:39 <chlorophilia> yeah, they\xe2\x80\x99re great. Now I am on Mac Air, for better or worse. Bought it when I studied in Amsterdam
2017-11-18T23:29:54 <Bosmon> Although I fear it will be pretty tough to install Windows 7 on it
2017-11-18T23:30:06 <chlorophilia> I just registered a new domain name\xe2\x80\xa6. salishseabiodiversity.org
2017-11-18T23:30:41 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I meant to answer the question you left here a couple of days ago
2017-11-18T23:30:50 <Bosmon> About perhaps omitting some of the columns from the visualisation
2017-11-18T23:30:54 <chlorophilia> the goal for the project will be to amalgamate data from other citizen science projects in the region. Ideally we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out a way of comparing the list data, in a standardize format such as the list I\xe2\x80\x99m using
2017-11-18T23:31:02 <Bosmon> Isn\'t the very lopsidedness of the tree of life once of its most real features?
2017-11-18T23:31:15 <chlorophilia> I like the lopsidedness yes\xe2\x80\x94I changed my mind about that :)
2017-11-18T23:31:16 <Bosmon> My feeling is it would be a bit misleading to try to elide that out of the graphics
2017-11-18T23:31:34 <Bosmon> Especially once you get into nutty things like Archaea
2017-11-18T23:31:39 <chlorophilia> I agree with you
2017-11-18T23:31:42 <Bosmon> Not that I expect anyone to try going observing those in Galiano : P
2017-11-18T23:32:11 <Bosmon> IF ONLY David Attenborough would make a programme about Archaea :)
2017-11-18T23:32:22 <Bosmon> It would go so far towards rehabilitating non-charismatic organisms
2017-11-18T23:32:28 <chlorophilia> Just thought I\xe2\x80\x99d give you a heads up, we might want to employ the sunburst to incorporate data from multiple projects!! hahahaa
2017-11-18T23:32:49 <Bosmon> Well absolutely, I would expect nothing less
2017-11-18T23:32:58 <chlorophilia> hahahaha yes, speaking of Attenborough, I should watch one of his films \xe2\x80\x94it has been too long
2017-11-18T23:33:11 <Bosmon> Apparently Blue Planet II is amazing
2017-11-18T23:33:15 <Bosmon> But I haven\'t been able to get round to it yet
2017-11-18T23:33:34 <Bosmon> Vastly enthusiastic though he is, he never really takes the approach I want
2017-11-18T23:33:41 <Bosmon> Although perhaps he takes the approach that most of the public wants
2017-11-18T23:33:48 <Bosmon> Which is to make it all about "little stories"
2017-11-18T23:33:49 <chlorophilia> right?
2017-11-18T23:34:29 <Bosmon> The thing he did that inspired me the most was this one: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hd5mf
2017-11-18T23:34:37 <Bosmon> But in terms of his own career this is just a quirky one-off
2017-11-18T23:39:08 <chlorophilia> Can\xe2\x80\x99t see the content alas\xe2\x80\xa6 I have a feeling I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that one, though
2017-11-18T23:39:28 <chlorophilia> Yes the \xe2\x80\x9cdeep time\xe2\x80\x9d perspective is definitely more inspiring than little stories
2017-11-18T23:39:51 <Bosmon> I think it is here: https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsxubk
2017-11-18T23:40:28 <Bosmon> Sadly the only lasting output other than the programme itself is a disgusting Flash 10 animation owned by a bunch of oil barons : P
2017-11-18T23:45:28 <chlorophilia> ugh
