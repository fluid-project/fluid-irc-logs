b'2017-07-26T15:28:02 <kasparnet> and then try logging in and seeing if things are working correctly there
2017-07-26T15:28:20 <kasparnet> and if not, make sure it does
2017-07-26T15:28:49 <kasparnet> at least I find it easier to debug there, since you can continously log in/out and go through the code
2017-07-26T15:29:04 <Justin_o> when you say login there, what do you mean exactly?
2017-07-26T15:29:25 <Justin_o> i guess you mean actually start an instance of the GPII and see if it works
2017-07-26T15:29:25 <kasparnet> oh, so enter: http://localhost:8081/user/<ourToken>/login
2017-07-26T15:29:29 <kasparnet> yup
2017-07-26T15:29:42 <kasparnet> where <ourToken> is the token for the NP set you want to test
2017-07-26T15:29:46 <Justin_o> kasparnet: another thing i\'m not sure of, is if my settings will be blocked by the match maker
2017-07-26T15:30:08 <kasparnet> they shouldn\'t if your solution is installed on the system
2017-07-26T15:30:17 <kasparnet> (ie. in the "installedSolutions.json" file
2017-07-26T15:30:29 <Justin_o> okay, yes i added the id there
2017-07-26T15:30:39 <Justin_o> that matches the one in my solutions registry entry
2017-07-26T15:30:57 <Justin_o> i\'ll try to run an instance in a VM
2017-07-26T15:31:15 <Justin_o> if i want to try this in windows, should i just use the master branch or hist?
2017-07-26T15:31:17 <Justin_o> HST
2017-07-26T15:38:10 <kasparnet> master branch, afaik

2017-07-26T12:21:16 <Justin_o> kasparnet: hello
2017-07-26T12:21:24 <kasparnet> hey Justin_o
2017-07-26T12:22:34 <Justin_o> I\'m working on the integration, writing the transformations in the solutions registry.. I added tests to windows-chrome-testSpec.js
2017-07-26T12:22:45 <Justin_o> they all seem to be returning undefined as the result
2017-07-26T12:23:45 <Justin_o> a couple questions 1) why do the common terms in the ISO24751-flat.json5 file use escapes, but we don\'t do that for the preferences in the preference sets
2017-07-26T12:24:48 <Justin_o> seems like we use the escaped versions in the win32.json5 file as well.
2017-07-26T12:25:00 <Justin_o> 2) is your model transformation test site down, i can\'t seem to access it
2017-07-26T12:28:30 <Justin_o> kasparnet: ^
2017-07-26T12:56:19 <kasparnet> 1) The reason for the escapes in the ontology document is that it is an actual transformation document, used as-is in the transformation framework
2017-07-26T12:57:01 <kasparnet> where as the preferences sets are used as input data (still used in the transformation document, but as input data, which doesn\'t interpret el-paths)
2017-07-26T12:57:12 <kasparnet> 2) Yeah, the server has crashed
2017-07-26T12:57:15 <kasparnet> :(
2017-07-26T12:58:18 <kasparnet> A really shitty version of it exists here
2017-07-26T12:58:32 <kasparnet> but I can see that I dont have any proper infusion references
2017-07-26T12:58:36 <kasparnet> Justin_o: ^
2017-07-26T12:58:51 <Justin_o> kasparnet: if you pasted a link , it didn\'t come through
2017-07-26T12:59:43 <Justin_o> kasparnet: so it seems that my tests aren\'t using the correct transformations.. how does the test in windows-chrome-testSpec get mapped to the solution
2017-07-26T12:59:54 <Justin_o> i was assuming the path under "options" would do this

2017-07-26T13:08:01 <kasparnet> sorry about that :)
2017-07-26T13:08:57 <Justin_o> kasparnet: np thanks for sharing
2017-07-26T13:10:55 <kasparnet> Justin_o: just looking at windows-chrome-testSpec
2017-07-26T13:11:48 <Justin_o> kasparnet: thanks
2017-07-26T13:12:43 <kasparnet> the "options" is specific to the settingshandler in question
2017-07-26T13:13:19 <kasparnet> as you can see in e.g. https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-nvda-testSpec.js
2017-07-26T13:15:31 <kasparnet> so there is no actual mapping to the solution in the tests
2017-07-26T13:16:15 <kasparnet> what it does is to log in the user, given by "userToken", and then it goes through all the entries in "settingsHadnlers"
2017-07-26T13:16:45 <kasparnet> and for each of those, it checks what has been set on the system, and whether they match the "settings" provided in the test
2017-07-26T13:17:08 <kasparnet> (the options path is used when fetching the settings applied to the system)
2017-07-26T13:17:11 <kasparnet> Justin_o: ^
2017-07-26T13:20:57 <Justin_o> kasparnet: so i\'m not sure how i test my capability transformations then
2017-07-26T13:22:38 <Justin_o> kasparnet: also there are old tests and references to com.ilunion.cloud4chrome which also use the gpii.settingsHandlers.webSockets... i\'d assume that lots of different things would be able to use this handler so i\'m guessing i wouldn\'t need to change anything related to com.ilunion.cloud4chrome
2017-07-26T13:22:41 <kasparnet> Justin_o: you _should_ be able to put a breakpoint where the model transformation is taking place
2017-07-26T13:23:42 <kasparnet> all those references to com.ilunion.cloud4chrome will be removed -- as can be seen in this pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/494
2017-07-26T13:23:43 <Justin_o> kasparnet: hmm.. not sure where that is, and also i get different results when running through vagrant and running directly off of my machine. Will debugging work if i run it through vagrant?
2017-07-26T13:24:07 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-07-26T13:24:10 <kasparnet> hmmm.... dont think i"ve tried that before
2017-07-26T13:24:32 <kasparnet> but they should be the same - the results
2017-07-26T13:24:59 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i get one of the values being transformed when run using grunt, but on my local machine i get undefined as the value
2017-07-26T13:25:18 <Justin_o> kasparnet: perhaps i need to install stuff on my local machine for it to work?
2017-07-26T13:25:24 <kasparnet> hmm... that\'s very werid
2017-07-26T13:26:01 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, by "grunt", did you mean "vagrant"?
2017-07-26T13:26:07 <the-t-in-rtf> va-grunt?
2017-07-26T13:26:59 <Justin_o> yes, vagrant
2017-07-26T13:27:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, inconsistencies like this are usually a good reminder to triple-check versions and reinstall dependencies, especially if you\'re moving back and forth between a different host and client OS
2017-07-26T13:28:23 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: i\'m assuming the tests should start up anything that needs to be running and loading any necessary config
2017-07-26T13:28:32 <Justin_o> i am using mac,  not sure if that has anything to do with it
2017-07-26T13:28:48 <kasparnet> Justin_o: I got a meeting now
2017-07-26T13:29:51 <kasparnet> but I\'ll be happy to fix up my transformation tester
2017-07-26T13:29:55 <kasparnet> so you can try that out
2017-07-26T13:30:13 <kasparnet> also, I can point you to where to break in the code, if you wanna try debugging the regular GPII/node process
2017-07-26T13:31:12 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i forked your transformation tester, seeing if i can get it working with an npm checkout of infusion now. I\'ll send you a PR if i get that working
2017-07-26T13:31:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I just this very moment got caught by the cross-platform node_modules issues in another project.
2017-07-26T13:31:26 <Justin_o> kasparnet: and would love to know where to put the breakpoint as well
2017-07-26T13:31:35 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s more of an issue between linux and windows, but it\'s still worth checking.
2017-07-26T13:32:17 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ah, because my node_modules may have been created by the linux instance in the vm?
2017-07-26T13:32:25 <Justin_o> in my case
2017-07-26T13:32:29 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, or vice versa
2017-07-26T13:32:42 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-07-26T13:32:56 <the-t-in-rtf> yarn is more resistant to this, as it blows away node_modules every time you run it.
2017-07-26T13:32:57 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks, i\'ll try blowing it away and testing again
2017-07-26T13:37:46 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks, now i\'m getting a consistent value, still not what i\'m hoping to get, but it\'s what i got in the VM.. so that\'s good.

2017-07-26T13:38:58 <Justin_o> very true
2017-07-26T13:48:27 <Justin_o> kasparnet: just sent you a PR for your transformation tester https://github.com/kaspermarkus/transformationTester/pull/1 You may want to add a license to the package.json

2017-07-26T14:18:53 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar, @amatas, or anyone, is there a one line command to display the vagrant images and version for the current working directory?
2017-07-26T14:20:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: I\'m trying to use VS Code for debugging the GPII universal test i\'m trying to run. I\'ve created a config which runs "npm run test:node-noprep". The Debug console only shows the npm error, which is likely for the test failure, but it doesn\'t show any of the tests output. Also the break points I\'m adding in the all-tests.js file are not being respected. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?
2017-07-26T14:23:25 <colinclark> I\'ve never tried it before with the GPII, Justin_o
2017-07-26T14:23:39 <colinclark> so I think you\'re in new, exciting territory :)

2017-07-26T14:28:37 <the-t-in-rtf> vagrant box outdated seems fine for what I want
2017-07-26T14:28:51 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. to know if it\'s simply up to date.

2017-07-26T15:15:44 <Justin_o> kasparnet: the basic transform that comes with your tester works, but i\'m not sure what syntax to use for my more complex transformation
2017-07-26T15:17:14 <Justin_o> kasparnet: do you have any examples.... i\'m finding that anytime i use "transform": {...} i get an empty object back, and when i just used the contents of the transform it seemed to be ignoring the type and treating the options themselves as a transform
2017-07-26T15:20:03 <kasparnet> Justin_o: https://pastebin.com/FyqJEab9
2017-07-26T15:20:12 <kasparnet> this one should work for example
2017-07-26T15:20:24 <kasparnet> or the data from that pastie
2017-07-26T15:20:28 <Justin_o> kasparnet: your pastebin is coign up as spam
2017-07-26T15:20:31 <Justin_o> so it won\'t show me :(
2017-07-26T15:20:42 <kasparnet> arh, crap - will paste on skype
2017-07-26T15:20:49 <kasparnet> btw - it\'s based on this solution registry entry
2017-07-26T15:21:09 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L226-L238
2017-07-26T15:21:20 <Justin_o> kasparnet: it\'s okay, turns out i had to fill in a captcha to see it.. it works now
2017-07-26T15:21:29 <kasparnet> oh ok, cool
2017-07-26T15:21:33 <Justin_o> or rather i can see it now, will test it out
2017-07-26T15:22:06 <kasparnet> (so the outer transform is implicit in the tool -- never documented anything, as I just made it for myself :) )
2017-07-26T15:23:13 <Justin_o> your example transform worked.. i\'ll try out some of mine
