2017-03-30T09:19:23 <amatas> fluid-everyone: I\'m going to update issues.gpii.net, I hope a downtime of 15 minutes or so.
2017-03-30T09:58:21 <amatas> issues.gpii.net is back and updated
2017-03-30T10:03:40 <stegru> and it even works
2017-03-30T10:04:02 <amatas> :D
2017-03-30T10:10:26 <amatas> at least the part I checked
2017-03-30T10:57:14 <jhernandez> stegru: buenos dias
2017-03-30T10:57:21 <jhernandez> I\'ve got a question related to https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/11
2017-03-30T10:58:02 <jhernandez> the original issue was that the notification wasn\'t being shown always
2017-03-30T11:00:19 <jhernandez> okay, I can answer to my question by simply testing it
2017-03-30T11:00:44 <jhernandez> in any case, what happens if for whatever reason the notification isn\'t being created?
2017-03-30T11:01:19 <jhernandez> are we going to hang out there forever waiting for the balloon-closed event?
2017-03-30T11:02:26 <jhernandez> or are we really sure that it was just a timing issue? (and we assume that the notifications always work)
2017-03-30T11:18:16 <jhernandez> stegru: okay, after a few attempts I could reproduce the issue
2017-03-30T11:19:03 <jhernandez> and yes, we end up hanging out there waiting for a balloon-closed event
2017-03-30T11:24:00 <stegru> sorry, i was just eating
2017-03-30T11:24:43 <stegru> well, are you afraid of the balloon never closing?
2017-03-30T11:25:23 <jhernandez> I\'m afraid of the balloon never opening
2017-03-30T11:25:32 <jhernandez> so we will wait forever
2017-03-30T11:25:45 <stegru> ah ok
2017-03-30T11:26:01 <stegru> so, shall we have both a timeout and wait for the close event?
2017-03-30T11:26:32 <jhernandez> also, I\'ve found that if you click on the notification the balloon-closed event is never being fired
2017-03-30T11:26:37 <jhernandez> :)
2017-03-30T11:26:57 <stegru> oh right, I didn\'t get that
2017-03-30T11:27:42 <stegru> i\'ll just make it die after 10 seconds, unless the close event is fired?
2017-03-30T11:28:53 <jhernandez> I guess that when you click on the notification the balloon-click event is fired
2017-03-30T11:29:03 <jhernandez> tssss
2017-03-30T11:29:43 <stegru> there is another way, instead of a balloon show a message box with an "ok" button - the only thing with this is it\'s synchronous and the function only returns after \'ok\' is clicked, but that\'s ok because we\'re terminating right after
2017-03-30T11:30:07 <stegru> they look butt-ugly, though
2017-03-30T11:30:30 <stegru> ok i\'ll listen on both, with a timeout as a back-up
2017-03-30T11:32:07 <jhernandez> well, I\'m not sure whether we want to complicate/uglify our code due to the malfunctioning of either electron or windows
2017-03-30T11:32:29 <stegru> yes, it\'s already ugly and complicated enough ;)
2017-03-30T11:34:40 <stegru> by the way, how are you reproducing this? I\'m just starting gpii (not the app)
2017-03-30T11:35:09 <jhernandez> with gpii-app
2017-03-30T11:35:40 <jhernandez> I first run node --debug-brk=8081 and then I run npm start
2017-03-30T11:35:42 <stegru> twice? to make 8081 in use?
2017-03-30T11:35:50 <stegru> ahh!
2017-03-30T11:38:51 <stegru> oh yes! I\'ve been clicking on the \'X\'.. not the balloon
2017-03-30T11:39:30 <jhernandez> yeah
2017-03-30T11:40:22 <jhernandez> looks like some people prefer to not use electron\'s builtin balloons
2017-03-30T11:41:22 <jhernandez> and use things like node-notifier, electron-notifications, etc
2017-03-30T11:42:30 <jhernandez> I\'m not sure what are the benefits or real motivations to use such alternatives
2017-03-30T11:49:42 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-03-30T11:51:01 <jhernandez> in any case, I guess that, for hst, it should be just fine to use the timeout as you suggested initially
2017-03-30T11:52:05 <jhernandez> I\'d say that we should file a JIRA describing the problem that we can reference from a TODO comment right before the timeout
2017-03-30T11:52:30 <jhernandez> stegru: does this make sense to you?
2017-03-30T11:53:33 <stegru> yes
2017-03-30T11:53:57 <stegru> and they look a bit nicer, jhernandez
2017-03-30T11:55:16 <stegru> ok make a jira so I can refer to it?
2017-03-30T11:57:15 <jhernandez> we can just add more information to the one we\'re already dealing with
2017-03-30T12:01:33 <stegru> pushed the fix, jhernandez
2017-03-30T12:01:44 <jhernandez> stegru: okay, thanks
2017-03-30T12:01:49 <stegru> i\'ve tried clicking, closing, and ignoring
2017-03-30T12:01:59 <jhernandez> I\'m commenting on the JIRA right now
2017-03-30T12:16:57 <jhernandez> stegru: done - thanks for the quick update
2017-03-30T12:17:16 <stegru> that\'s ok javjarfer
2017-03-30T12:17:22 <stegru> jhernandez, i mean
2017-03-30T12:17:24 <jhernandez> I\'ll re-review it after ci passes

2017-03-30T14:46:02 <jhernandez> do you mind taking a look at this pull request (https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/117) from stegru?
2017-03-30T14:46:32 <jhernandez> ok, stegru just closed it
2017-03-30T14:46:34 <jhernandez> :)
2017-03-30T14:46:57 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-03-30T14:47:14 <stegru> oh i\'m changing the jira number
2017-03-30T14:47:26 <jhernandez> stegru: don\'t worry
2017-03-30T14:47:44 <jhernandez> I\'ll re-ping Bosmon2 with the right pr once you\'re done
2017-03-30T14:48:17 <jhernandez> stegru: mmm, the branch had the right name
2017-03-30T14:48:49 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-03-30T14:50:14 <jhernandez> you could just have performed a git commit --ammend to fix the typo in the commit message and followed by a git push --force
2017-03-30T14:50:30 <jhernandez> in any case, do whatever you feel more comfortable with
2017-03-30T14:54:03 <stegru> it was only a couple of lines

2017-03-30T17:25:44 <jhung> Cool Justin_o. That\'s worth looking into.
2017-03-30T17:26:28 <Justin_o> i used it for the new prefs framework demo.. it turned 28000 lines of css that i still had to clean up down to 1204
