2017-03-07T15:23:48 <javjarfer> Bosmon, do you think this is a limitation in "gpii.launch.exec()", should I note it to review it later?
2017-03-07T15:45:47 <stegru> no javjarfer, it\'s a limitation of DOS using the charactor commonly used for escaping as a directory separater
2017-03-07T15:58:17 <javjarfer> stegru, haha yes... well, but we need to workaround its (silly) limitations
2017-03-07T15:59:02 <Bosmon> Hey there stegru - so what do we think of this test failure?
2017-03-07T15:59:03 <Bosmon> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/134/console
2017-03-07T15:59:32 <Bosmon> I imagine it\'s a variant of the Cortana failure we had before
2017-03-07T15:59:49 <Bosmon> Also, gtirloni - has something gone missing from our JIRA UI?
2017-03-07T15:59:58 <javjarfer> stegru, also, I wanted to ask you, how do you normally get the windows handles programmatically (Windows)?
2017-03-07T16:00:04 <Bosmon> There used to be a link to corresponding pull requests
2017-03-07T16:00:05 <Bosmon> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2315

2017-03-07T16:00:18 <Bosmon> But I can\'t see a link to it
2017-03-07T16:01:30 <gtirloni> Bosmon: try logging in
2017-03-07T16:01:32 <stegru> Bosmon: oh god yes - I\'m not sure if it was a random breakage, or something has happened.
2017-03-07T16:02:11 <Bosmon> gtirloni - sorry to bother you with my silly requests :)
2017-03-07T16:02:16 <Bosmon> I guess I am still a little hung over from last night
2017-03-07T16:02:45 <gtirloni> np! :) it\'s weird though.. why it\'s hidden if you\'re not logged in...
2017-03-07T16:03:02 <stegru> Bosmon: and there is a PR for it.. I guess your comment on it means you found it?
2017-03-07T16:03:09 <gtirloni> i only logged in to go to the admin panel and check what could be it.. and then the PR showed up
2017-03-07T16:04:25 <stegru> javjarfer: it really depends on what you (the software) already know.. there\'s things like "WindowFromPoint", and "FindWindowEx", and others
2017-03-07T16:05:36 <javjarfer> stegru, okay, thanks you. It is just for the sake of being complete when writing the used approaches
2017-03-07T16:06:13 <stegru> not sure what you mean, but ok as long as you\'re happy, javjarfer
2017-03-07T16:06:16 <stegru> :)
2017-03-07T16:09:48 <javjarfer> stegru, haha sorry, it\'s for a guide resuming the procedure we use to onboard, It will be necessary to have a resume for when we want to integrate all we have (UI Automation, Message passing, system calls) into the system in a near future
2017-03-07T16:10:39 <javjarfer> sometimes maybe a combination of this tools give the best approach, so it will be good to take all of them into account and documented
2017-03-07T16:10:47 <stegru> oh ok
2017-03-07T16:11:04 <stegru> there is a function to get the taskbar handle
2017-03-07T16:11:24 <stegru> it\'s escaped me
2017-03-07T16:11:28 <javjarfer> really? that is nice
2017-03-07T16:13:11 <stegru> no, there isn\'t jab

2017-03-07T19:21:30 <alanharnum> simonjb\'s talk is great
2017-03-07T19:21:41 <alanharnum> but i think its success really hangs on the diamond transition i put at the end

2017-03-07T19:25:17 <alanharnum> gtirloni: simonjb\'s... I think it\'s a Nexus 6?
2017-03-07T19:25:22 <michelled> the audio is great
2017-03-07T19:25:33 <gtirloni> nice video btw, having watched it live at the office i feel it didn\'t quite capture simon\'s soul though
2017-03-07T19:25:48 <michelled> he might want to keep his soul
2017-03-07T19:25:52 <alanharnum> a key lesson learned by me was how to not hold the phone in such a way that my finger covered the microphone
2017-03-07T19:26:16 <simonjb> gtirloni, alanharnum: it\'s a Nexus 5X
2017-03-07T19:26:55 <simonjb> it\'s amazing what you can do with a recent vintage mobile phone
2017-03-07T19:27:17 <michelled> yes, the diamond is awesome
2017-03-07T19:27:42 <alanharnum> yeah i was really impressed with how well it came out for time invested
2017-03-07T19:27:54 <gtirloni> simonjb alanharnum: i was wondering if video estabilization was on? by phone is supposed to do that but i see the nexus may have a specific knob for that (http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-one-line-tweak-adds-electronic-image-stabilization-to-the-nexus-5x-camera/)
2017-03-07T19:28:14 <gtirloni> mine never works though :(
2017-03-07T19:28:18 <alanharnum> maybe 30 minutes to record (would be faster next time since I now know phone mic location), another hour or so to upload / transcribe / edit
2017-03-07T19:28:27 <alanharnum> gtirloni: it\'s possible Youtube did some auto stabilaztion
2017-03-07T19:28:41 <cindyli> alanharnum: you need a tripod next time
2017-03-07T19:29:03 <alanharnum> cindyli: a tripod would have gotten in the way of all my zooooooooooms
2017-03-07T19:29:33 <cindyli> haha, true tho
2017-03-07T19:29:58 <simonjb> gtirloni: I don\'t see any specific options for video stabilization
2017-03-07T19:30:47 <simonjb> gtirloni: I didn\'t make any edits like in the link you pasted
2017-03-07T19:31:07 <gtirloni> yeah, looks like it requires the phone to be rooted
2017-03-07T19:31:08 <simonjb> it\'s just as default
2017-03-07T19:32:10 <simonjb> for something more static, a tripod would be great
2017-03-07T19:32:17 <gtirloni> it looks good though, i was just curious because estabilization has been a struggle for me
2017-03-07T19:32:37 <simonjb> but in this case the hand-held worked well with the zooming and panning around
2017-03-07T19:32:42 <gtirloni> yep
2017-03-07T19:32:50 <michelled> jhung: is anything still happening with Vicki Moulder or Colin Madland?
2017-03-07T19:33:11 <simonjb> I think that the amount of moving around helped rather than holding steady
2017-03-07T19:33:34 <simonjb> so the muscles stay fluid
2017-03-07T19:33:39 <gtirloni> agreed, i found it super easy to follow and the camera movement draws attention to the changes
2017-03-07T19:33:59 <gtirloni> maybe alanharnum may want to upgrade to this next time? http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/presidentialportrait/images/Obama-InLightStage-FromBehind.jpg
2017-03-07T19:34:19 <jhung> michelled: nothing w Vicki. Colin I can reach out to and see where he\'s at.
2017-03-07T19:34:59 <simonjb> gtirloni: that\'s a great photo
2017-03-07T19:35:03 <alanharnum> simonjb: I definitely had to find a good way of gripping the phone that didn\'t cover the microphone but didn\'t cause me hand pain after about 2-3 minutes

2017-03-07T10:41:53 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, I\'m updating to the latest vagrant-qi-plugin and verifying the previously reported problem.
2017-03-07T10:42:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Are there any other changes besides the filename and the stages -> .ci_stages change?
2017-03-07T10:45:37 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, just to confirm, only vagrant ci test runs the tests, right?
2017-03-07T10:45:45 <the-t-in-rtf> In other words, vagrant up alone should not run the tests?
2017-03-07T11:07:42 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, yes, the definition file name has changed from .gpii-ci.yml to .vagrant.yml
2017-03-07T11:07:55 <amatas> vagrant up shouldn\'t run the tests
2017-03-07T11:08:16 <the-t-in-rtf> then I\'ve just confirmed that the initial state of the VM already has the one-line files (only CRs)
2017-03-07T11:08:23 <amatas> only the command "vagrant ci test" runs all the stages if the option "--stage" is not set
2017-03-07T11:08:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I used "vagrant up"
2017-03-07T11:09:04 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, that behavior always happens since you\'re using files that have been fetched from a unix box
2017-03-07T11:09:34 <amatas> this isn\'t new
2017-03-07T11:09:36 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, and it\'s a problem.
2017-03-07T11:09:56 <amatas> but I don\'t understand why it is a problem now
2017-03-07T11:10:14 <the-t-in-rtf> we\'re only encountering it now because previously there was no Windows VM in the QI environment
2017-03-07T11:10:21 <the-t-in-rtf> previous, mounting the OS X content in linux was OK.
2017-03-07T11:10:23 <the-t-in-rtf> ly
2017-03-07T11:10:25 <amatas> because this behavior happens since we use Virtualbox
2017-03-07T11:10:37 <the-t-in-rtf> It happens because of the particular way you choose to use Virtualbox.
2017-03-07T11:10:43 <the-t-in-rtf> There are certainly other ways to handle this.
2017-03-07T11:10:45 <amatas> The CI uses windows VM to test GPII-Windows
2017-03-07T11:11:09 <amatas> and the one-line files weren\'t a problem until now
2017-03-07T11:11:19 <the-t-in-rtf> The problem is when launching from a Mac host environment.
2017-03-07T11:11:26 <amatas> it\'s the same
2017-03-07T11:11:45 <the-t-in-rtf> So, your work is already running on the CI server?
2017-03-07T11:12:19 <amatas> ok, first, the vagrant-ci plugin only run tests on virtualbox machines, this problem is unrelated to the plugin
2017-03-07T11:12:49 <the-t-in-rtf> it also provisions the VM.
2017-03-07T11:13:03 <amatas> and, the environment used to test the GPII  projects that is Virtualbox + Vagrant is already running in the CI since the CI exists
2017-03-07T11:13:16 <amatas> provision = run commands
2017-03-07T11:13:36 <amatas> the plugin only defines some vms and run commands inside then
2017-03-07T11:13:46 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but it\'s responsible for the initial setup of the VM as well.
2017-03-07T11:14:05 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. when I run vagrant up, I don\'t have any other Vagrantfile.  I\'m only using your plugin.
2017-03-07T11:14:08 <amatas> yes, it recreates the same setup that you can make with a Vagrantfile
2017-03-07T11:14:15 <the-t-in-rtf> obviously not.
2017-03-07T11:14:17 <amatas> that\'s correct
2017-03-07T11:14:27 <the-t-in-rtf> if it did, we wouldn\'t be having this conversation.
2017-03-07T11:14:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, so "ok, first, the vagrant-ci plugin only run tests on virtualbox machines, this problem is unrelated to the plugin"
2017-03-07T11:14:58 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s not correct
2017-03-07T11:15:12 <the-t-in-rtf> even if your intent is to do what was done previously, the plugin is still doing the work.
2017-03-07T11:15:49 <amatas> let me check one thing
2017-03-07T11:15:52 <the-t-in-rtf> sure.

2017-03-07T11:22:14 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I\'ve done the following steps
2017-03-07T11:22:27 <amatas> vagrant up - to create the Windows VM
2017-03-07T11:22:42 <amatas> vagrant ci test --stage setup - to install node and all the modules
2017-03-07T11:22:47 <the-t-in-rtf> stop
2017-03-07T11:22:52 <the-t-in-rtf> you\'ve already gone too far.
2017-03-07T11:22:55 <amatas> ok
2017-03-07T11:23:09 <the-t-in-rtf> the files are already in the wrong format once you run "vagrant up"
2017-03-07T11:23:27 <amatas> :D define "wrong format"
2017-03-07T11:23:33 <the-t-in-rtf> nothing else will help from that point except perhaps running unix2dos on the files, which would mess them up for the host environment.
2017-03-07T11:23:57 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. they have unix-style CRs from the beginnning
2017-03-07T11:24:02 <the-t-in-rtf> s/nnn/nn/
2017-03-07T11:24:05 <amatas> please forget the unix2dos utility, that was my first thought about this and it\'s wrong
2017-03-07T11:24:55 <amatas> yes, the files has the unix-style from the beginning since they were fetched using git at the macos shell
2017-03-07T11:25:25 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, and that\'s a problem.
2017-03-07T11:25:33 <the-t-in-rtf> we need to set up /vagrant using some other means.
2017-03-07T11:25:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t care how, I only care that a) the tests run and b) no changes are made to the host content
2017-03-07T11:26:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I was willing to live without b) up to this point, as we were only talking about node_modules
2017-03-07T11:26:36 <amatas> but as I said that happens from the beginning of the CI because we use Virtualbox on unix machines, why is it a problem now?
2017-03-07T11:26:51 <the-t-in-rtf> is your work doing the provisioning on the CI server?
2017-03-07T11:27:54 <amatas> let me make another check
2017-03-07T11:32:03 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-03-07T11:33:37 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, if I run git clone /vagrant cloned from a Windows drive, I get the current content, but with CR/LFs
2017-03-07T11:33:53 <the-t-in-rtf> that gives you one option
2017-03-07T11:34:01 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, lunchtime here, back in a few.
2017-03-07T11:37:49 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, https://www.pastery.net/ejaeem/
2017-03-07T11:38:13 <amatas> there you have a Vagrant file to substitute the .vagrant.yml
2017-03-07T11:38:43 <amatas> remove the .vagrant.yml and uninstall the vagrant-gpii-ci plugin "vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-gpii-ci"
2017-03-07T11:39:16 <amatas> now run vagrant up, and inside the VM, in the c:\\vagrant run "npm tests" you will get the same result
2017-03-07T12:13:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, I\'m a bit more interested in ways of using Vagrant that actually work\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2017-03-07T12:14:32 <the-t-in-rtf> If I wanted to use git clone and run the tests in another directory, where is the working directory in which tests are run configured?
2017-03-07T12:14:47 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. how does it know that it should be in /vagrant to run "npm tests"?
2017-03-07T12:15:20 <the-t-in-rtf> and is that per-command, or can I just change to another directory as one of the test commands?
2017-03-07T12:21:26 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I only showing you that the Vagrant-CI plugin is not related with this issue.
2017-03-07T12:21:30 <the-t-in-rtf> ugh.
2017-03-07T12:21:41 <the-t-in-rtf> if you do the wrong thing manually and do the same wrong thing in your plugin, it\'s still related.
2017-03-07T12:22:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, using git clone seems like a really nice option here, maybe you could help me try that?
2017-03-07T12:22:17 <amatas> the commands are executed in c:\\vagrant because the plugin executes first "cd c:\\vagrant" before any command
2017-03-07T12:22:28 <the-t-in-rtf> is that configurable, or hard-coded?
2017-03-07T12:22:42 <the-t-in-rtf> and I assume that I can just issue my own cd command to change the cwd once?
2017-03-07T12:24:11 <amatas> what wrong thing I\'m doing? seriously, I\'m not able to understand you, because you keep saying that the plugin is "converting" the files from the host to the guest VMs. And that\'s not true.
2017-03-07T12:24:46 <amatas> every time that you read a text file in a shared folder of virtualbox that is owned by a unix host, you will get the unix-new lines
2017-03-07T12:24:50 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, there\'s no conversion.  It\'s simply failing to supply the host content in a way that can be used in the client VM.
2017-03-07T12:25:57 <amatas> but again, that behavior is what we have every time we use virtualbox, and the CI didn\'t have any problem in the past related to this
2017-03-07T12:26:04 <the-t-in-rtf> You have a problem now.
2017-03-07T12:26:39 <the-t-in-rtf> it doesn\'t matter if this is the first time you\'re seeing it.
2017-03-07T12:26:46 <the-t-in-rtf> it doesn\'t matter what the root cause is.
2017-03-07T12:26:59 <the-t-in-rtf> this is something that needs to be solved, and which obviously can be solved.
2017-03-07T12:27:05 <the-t-in-rtf> It took me minutes to think up a solution.
2017-03-07T12:27:34 <the-t-in-rtf> please join me in thinking of solutions, I am certainly not the last mac dev who\'s going to encounter this.
2017-03-07T12:27:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, did you try the git clone in the Windows VM?
2017-03-07T12:29:24 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I just trying to focus in to figure out where the problem is. Because for me, it seems a nyc or istanbul bug
2017-03-07T12:29:52 <the-t-in-rtf> no
2017-03-07T12:29:53 <amatas> we can workaround the issue using Vagrant/Virtualbox features, but it won\'t fix the issue.
2017-03-07T12:29:56 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s not
2017-03-07T12:30:03 <the-t-in-rtf> it is absolutely related to the way we use Virtualbox
2017-03-07T12:30:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I have repeatedly given you examples
2017-03-07T12:30:23 <the-t-in-rtf> if you check out the repo from within the VM, nyc works perfectly well.
2017-03-07T12:30:58 <the-t-in-rtf> and istanbul has no impact on the problem.
2017-03-07T12:31:02 <amatas> so why are these test ok : https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-tests/lastSuccessfulBuild/
2017-03-07T12:31:41 <amatas> here we have a windows virtual machine on a linux host, and at the begginning of the CI the host was a mac mini.
2017-03-07T12:32:03 <the-t-in-rtf> So, your plugin is in use on that machine?
2017-03-07T12:32:36 <the-t-in-rtf> And that project uses your configuration file format?
2017-03-07T12:32:49 <amatas> no, my plugin isn\'t in that machine
2017-03-07T12:33:05 <amatas> no, that project uses the original Vagrantfile
2017-03-07T12:33:37 <the-t-in-rtf> so, is there a way I can run those tests using vagrant ci test from my machine?
2017-03-07T12:34:26 <amatas> it is, only you need to check out the GPII windows branch that you want to test
2017-03-07T12:34:54 <amatas> remove the Vagrantfile and use this .vagrant.yml file https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci/blob/master/samples/gpii-windows/.vagrant.yml
2017-03-07T12:39:20 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, running that now.
2017-03-07T12:46:02 <the-t-in-rtf> So, @amatas, while that\'s running, maybe you can comment on this:
2017-03-07T12:46:06 <the-t-in-rtf> $moduleLocation = Join-Path $env:SystemDrive "vagrant/provisioning/Provisioning.psm1"
2017-03-07T12:46:06 <the-t-in-rtf> $destinationDir = Join-Path $env:SystemDrive "tmp"
2017-03-07T12:46:06 <the-t-in-rtf> cp $moduleLocation $destinationDir
2017-03-07T12:46:18 <the-t-in-rtf> That really seems like it\'s copying content out of /vagrant first.
2017-03-07T12:46:41 <the-t-in-rtf> (that\'s from the output of vagrant up using your .vagrant.yml file and the windows repo)
2017-03-07T12:46:49 <the-t-in-rtf> what is that copy used for?
2017-03-07T12:47:05 <the-t-in-rtf> and why does it have to be copied?
2017-03-07T12:47:27 <amatas> those scripts are part of the installer build
2017-03-07T12:47:39 <amatas> (I believe)
2017-03-07T12:47:41 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, my question is, why does it have to be copied?
2017-03-07T12:47:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, "vagrant ci test" also fails on my machine.
2017-03-07T12:48:46 <amatas> could you paste the part of the output of the failure in https://www.pastery.net
2017-03-07T12:48:52 <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.pastery.net/qeubcp/
2017-03-07T12:50:21 <amatas> Avtar faced the same error yesterday, I have to meet with him to debug it. I\'m not able to reproduce on my side.
2017-03-07T12:52:04 <amatas> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L35 <- here you have why some files are copied to another location.
2017-03-07T12:53:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, all the FS content in the VM is also one line for me when using your file and gpii-windows.
2017-03-07T12:53:49 <the-t-in-rtf> what platform are you on?
2017-03-07T12:54:53 <amatas> anyway, that error is related to the build of the installer, can you run "vagrant ci test --stage test"
2017-03-07T12:55:08 <amatas> my platform is a macbook pro
2017-03-07T12:55:56 <the-t-in-rtf> that fails with a different error.
2017-03-07T12:56:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Mainly because the provisioning didn\'t complete, I\'d assume.
2017-03-07T13:00:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if Avtar also has the problem, hopefully you can troubleshoot both.

2017-03-07T13:21:16 <javjarfer> hi all, anyone knows how to scape a route for a executable when calling "gpii.launch.exe". Right now I have tested "command": "\\"C:\\\\path with spaces\\\\example.exe\\" -option", also "\\"C:\\\\path with spaces\\\\example.exe\\\\\\" -option" and other variations.
2017-03-07T13:21:31 <javjarfer> No one did the trick
