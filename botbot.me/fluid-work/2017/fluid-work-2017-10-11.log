2017-10-11T14:25:03 <yuriy> Hi, stegru! A while ago you mentioned that the core team is working on error dialogs. When you have the chance, could you please let me know what is the status of this work currently and whether there is a branch with it that we can take a look at.
2017-10-11T14:25:12 <yuriy> The key-in functionality in the PCP needs to display a dialog on incorrect key-in and we were wondering if we could reuse your functionality or if we should build something temporary for now.
2017-10-11T14:25:27 <stegru> hi yuriy
2017-10-11T14:26:16 <stegru> I don't know - i haven't done any work on this... michelled may arrive soon, I think it's something she is working on
2017-10-11T14:26:41 <yuriy> I see, thank you
2017-10-11T14:26:49 <yuriy> I will ask her
2017-10-11T14:27:09 <stegru> that's ok
2017-10-11T14:28:29 <stegru> yuriy: I did a small bit of related work on this, if you look in app.js and search for the uncaught exception handler... but that was a temporary thing until someone could spend more time on it
2017-10-11T14:30:02 <yuriy> I\xc2\xb4ll take a look, thanks
2017-10-11T14:37:47 <colinclark> michelled is at a conference today, yuriy, but I can let her know that you were asking
2017-10-11T14:37:55 <colinclark> in the meantime I bet Bosmon can point you to anything you need
