2017-07-27T11:23:56 <amatas> Hi Bosmon, I\'ve tried to run the tests using your PR #531 of universal.
2017-07-27T11:24:13 <amatas> Just to be sure that I did it well, I\'ve checked out the master branch of GPII-windows and I changed the version of the universal module of package.json from gpii/universal#a9d56aa6dfc67e9430c9175826fe9d3e3bbc6c93 to amb26/universal#GPII-2483. Then I provisioned the windows VM and run the tests.
2017-07-27T11:24:37 <amatas> With that setup I got this error: https://justpaste.it/19f0f the path C:\\vboxsrv\\vagrant\\.... doesn\'t exist in the VM.

2017-07-27T11:29:33 <Bosmon> Thanks for the report, amatas
2017-07-27T11:29:47 <Bosmon> Looks like there is yet another infuriating wrinkle to sort out with the UNC paths
2017-07-27T11:30:07 <amatas> you\'re welcome
2017-07-27T11:30:14 <amatas> it seems so
2017-07-27T11:30:35 <amatas> the string "vboxsrv" is the server name of the network drive.
2017-07-27T11:30:44 <amatas> it that helps

2017-07-27T14:01:25 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I\'ve rolled 3.0.0-dev.20170727T125648Z.47055ca to fix the issue amatas noted
2017-07-27T14:01:41 <Bosmon> In this case it seems sufficient to update universal\'s own reference to Infusion to allow the windows tests to pass
2017-07-27T14:01:48 <Bosmon> So we can push this through the stack at our leisure
2017-07-27T14:03:01 <Bosmon> amatas - thanks for the testing of the fix in windows
2017-07-27T14:03:21 <Bosmon> I\'m particularly interested though in testing of the fix in universal, to the browser tests
2017-07-27T14:03:50 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-27T14:04:30 <Bosmon> In order to verify whether GPII-2456 is resolved
2017-07-27T14:05:05 <Bosmon> You may remember that gtirloni found that by running the universal browser tests in CI on a machine that was heavily loaded, he could reproduce the "fluid.tabbable is not a function" error more frequently
2017-07-27T14:12:33 <clown> thanks stegru, I\'ll try that out
2017-07-27T14:14:29 <stegru> I thought it was marged already in, too
2017-07-27T14:14:48 <clown> perhaps it was homered.
2017-07-27T14:14:56 <stegru> doh!
2017-07-27T14:14:58 * clown looks
2017-07-27T14:16:19 <clown> I don\'t see any reference to GPII-2495 in the commit logs, but there\'s always the chance that I\'m searching for the wrong string.
2017-07-27T14:19:28 <amatas> Bosmon: let me check if I can reproduce that behavior on my laptop. I\'m running the VMs with the lowest CPU speed that it can
2017-07-27T14:19:36 <Justin_o> jhernandez, Bosmon: where do the preferences sets have to be for them to be picked up by GPII?
2017-07-27T14:20:13 <jhernandez> Justin_o: hey
2017-07-27T14:20:21 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello
2017-07-27T14:20:31 <jhernandez> we put the np sets under testData/preferences/
2017-07-27T14:20:54 <Justin_o> jhernandez: what about for the windows-chrome-testSpec.js tests
2017-07-27T14:21:08 <jhernandez> if they are part of acceptance/integration tests, then they should go under testData/preferences/acceptanceTesting/
2017-07-27T14:21:12 <jhernandez> ;)
2017-07-27T14:21:44 <jhernandez> sorry, testData/preferences/acceptanceTests/
2017-07-27T14:23:31 <Justin_o> jhernandez: okay thanks, i\'m trying to track down why my capability transformations aren\'t working in the windows-chrome-testSpec tests... kaspar had suggested I try out GPII running, but because all my prefs sets are under acceptanceTests they aren\'t showing up. I\'ll add another one to try though. Any idea  where to put a break point to investigate the model transformations in the tests though?

2017-07-27T14:55:13 <jhernandez> maybe it\'s just a tiny error, make sure that the terms are right, well escaped (if needed), eetc
2017-07-27T14:55:36 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks, i copied the formats of what was there, so i hope that\'s okay
2017-07-27T14:55:42 <Justin_o> but i make lots of small mistakes
2017-07-27T14:56:27 <jhernandez> yeah, sometimes it\'s just a typo or something missing, such as the common term in the ontology file, etc
2017-07-27T14:56:36 <clown> stegru, yes, after following the-t-in-rtf\'s directions in that JIRA, the Spi failures go away.  But your changes aren\'t in master.  I will document that on my pull request.

2017-07-27T17:06:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: question about your comment on FLUID-6172  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/837#discussion_r129870763
2017-07-27T17:06:56 <Justin_o> you\'re suggesting i just use roundToDecimal all the time?
2017-07-27T17:07:08 <Bosmon> yes, given the effect would have to be the same
2017-07-27T17:07:17 <Bosmon> Unless it is broken
2017-07-27T17:07:21 <Justin_o> i had left the check there so that it would switch back to the basic Math.round if there was no scale
2017-07-27T17:07:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i ran the tests and am getting a couple of failures now
2017-07-27T17:08:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  the ones for lossy inverse transforms are failing
2017-07-27T17:08:17 <Justin_o> sorry, one a couple of those are
2017-07-27T17:08:20 <Justin_o> only
2017-07-27T17:09:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems it\'s related to -912.50 rounding away from 0 instead of round up, which Math.round() does
2017-07-27T17:09:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what do you think about that
2017-07-27T17:12:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I think it is a highly interesting inconsistency :)
2017-07-27T17:12:52 <Bosmon> One well worth knowing about
2017-07-27T17:13:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so you think i should just fix the tests and update the docs?
2017-07-27T17:14:24 <Bosmon> Well, we should try to understand the implications of the different rounding models, if there are any
2017-07-27T17:15:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in general i\'m not sure
2017-07-27T17:15:25 <Bosmon> I see that MDN says this: "Note that this differs from many languages\' round() functions, which often round this case to the next integer away from zero"
2017-07-27T17:15:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i suppose, like the tests, it could break implementation that relied on things always rounding up.

2017-07-27T17:21:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_away_from_zero
2017-07-27T17:26:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - in the interest of consistency, it seems best to implement a transform which operates a consistent rounding model on all inputs
2017-07-27T17:27:03 <Bosmon> Especially if, as it seems, we can\'t configure our roundToDecimal scheme to do rounding to infinity
2017-07-27T17:29:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you mean for both integers and decimals
2017-07-27T17:29:17 <Justin_o> ?
2017-07-27T17:29:44 <Justin_o> and when you say consistent rounding, do you mean it consistently rounds, or that the rounding is consistent with Math.round()?
2017-07-27T17:29:52 <Bosmon> I mean that it consistently rounds
2017-07-27T17:30:41 <Justin_o> okay, so using roundToDecimal for all cases is okay?
2017-07-27T17:31:01 <Bosmon> There\'s nothing particularly magic about being consistent with Math.round, and it seems that from the MDN comment this is not what users of many other languages will expect anyway
2017-07-27T17:31:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool, so i\'ll just update the docs them and rely on roundToDecimal for all the rounding
2017-07-27T17:32:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yup, seems good to me
2017-07-27T17:32:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool, i\'ll have that done in a few minutes.. thanks
