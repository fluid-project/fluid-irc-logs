b'2017-05-26T21:38:50 <Bosmon7> Now a blue square with a giant button reading RESET
2017-05-26T21:38:56 <Bosmon7> Fuck!
2017-05-26T21:38:58 <Bosmon7> I see MYSELF!
2017-05-26T21:39:08 <simonjb> WOW!!!!
2017-05-26T21:39:11 <Bosmon7> With a green dot on my nose
2017-05-26T21:39:15 <Bosmon7> And a yellow one on my chine
2017-05-26T21:39:17 <simonjb> great
2017-05-26T21:39:18 <colinclark> yes!
2017-05-26T21:39:30 <simonjb> now open the bonang synth
2017-05-26T21:39:33 <colinclark> soon you\'ll be playing gamelan with said nose and chin
2017-05-26T21:39:46 <Bosmon7> Bonang synth is open
2017-05-26T21:39:48 <simonjb> and then the zone controller asterics version
2017-05-26T21:39:54 <Bosmon7> ah
2017-05-26T21:39:58 <Bosmon7> This is just endless
2017-05-26T21:40:25 <simonjb> use the "reset" button to calibrate the zone controller
2017-05-26T21:40:28 <colinclark> endless user delight, am I right?
2017-05-26T21:40:42 <Bosmon7> colinclark - I wonder what is making you so lippy this evening :)
2017-05-26T21:41:16 <simonjb> he\'s listening to loud dance music in his office
2017-05-26T21:41:51 <colinclark> lip!
2017-05-26T21:41:57 <colinclark> I only know the unicode for a bat
2017-05-26T21:42:01 <Bosmon7> Rachael is completely astonished by this
2017-05-26T21:42:01 <colinclark> sadly not for lips
2017-05-26T21:42:18 <colinclark> are you playing music with your chin?
2017-05-26T21:43:08 <Bosmon7> Ok
2017-05-26T21:43:08 <colinclark> here\'s a tiger, though
2017-05-26T21:43:09 <colinclark> \xf0\x9f\x90\x85
2017-05-26T21:43:14 <Bosmon7> This is a brilliant achievement for the evening
2017-05-26T21:43:26 <colinclark> \xf0\x9f\x90\x85\xf0\x9f\xa6\x87
2017-05-26T21:43:26 <Bosmon7> Yes, I am relieved to say that on my 90s-era IRC client I simply see a black square
2017-05-26T21:43:30 <Bosmon7> two black squares
2017-05-26T21:43:32 <colinclark> oh man
2017-05-26T21:43:33 <Bosmon7> But I assume you know this :)
2017-05-26T21:43:52 <colinclark> https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/
2017-05-26T21:43:59 * simonjb wishes he had a unicode font in his IRC client to see all of colinclark\'s great messages
2017-05-26T21:44:04 <colinclark> Good thing your web browser possibly isn\'t from the \'90s
2017-05-26T21:44:10 <colinclark> possibly, but not certainly
2017-05-26T21:44:38 <colinclark> simonjb, you need to get some font advice from Avtar
2017-05-26T21:44:46 <colinclark> only the finest Linux font for that guy
2017-05-26T21:44:50 <simonjb> yes, that is true
2017-05-26T21:45:03 <simonjb> Bosmon7: is it working?
2017-05-26T21:45:07 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes
2017-05-26T21:45:12 <Bosmon7> The audio crackles and spits a bit
2017-05-26T21:45:13 <simonjb> yeah!!!
2017-05-26T21:45:15 <colinclark> fuck it
2017-05-26T21:45:19 <Bosmon7> But I assume I can fix this by running the synth on my tablet
2017-05-26T21:45:20 <colinclark> why is it crackling!
2017-05-26T21:45:27 <Bosmon7> Well why do you think
2017-05-26T21:45:29 <colinclark> oh oh
2017-05-26T21:45:34 <colinclark> you must be on your development machine?
2017-05-26T21:45:38 <Bosmon7> It is fighting for CPU and garbage with 105 other chrome windows :)
2017-05-26T21:45:40 <colinclark> with its 486 processor?
2017-05-26T21:45:41 <Bosmon7> No, entertainment machine
2017-05-26T21:45:49 <colinclark> yack
2017-05-26T21:45:53 <colinclark> we should be able to do better than that
2017-05-26T21:45:54 <colinclark> oh well
2017-05-26T21:45:57 <Bosmon7> But I can run the synth on the tablet, right?
2017-05-26T21:45:58 <simonjb> chrome?
2017-05-26T21:46:06 <colinclark> what\'s "the tablet?"
2017-05-26T21:46:21 <Bosmon7> Nexus 10
2017-05-26T21:46:24 <colinclark> hmmm
2017-05-26T21:46:25 <colinclark> well
2017-05-26T21:46:25 <Bosmon7> In Google\'s sense
2017-05-26T21:46:34 <colinclark> I guess it\'s worth a shot
2017-05-26T21:46:39 <Bosmon7> ok
2017-05-26T21:46:45 <Bosmon7> I\'ll try that tomorrow
2017-05-26T21:46:53 <Bosmon7> Any reason Web Audio shouldn\'t work on Android?
2017-05-26T21:47:02 <colinclark> it works just fine
2017-05-26T21:47:17 <colinclark> I can\'t remember how costly the instrument is
2017-05-26T21:47:31 <colinclark> and the Nexus 10 is a bit pokey by today\'s standards
2017-05-26T21:47:46 <colinclark> and Flocking, well, you know :P
2017-05-26T21:47:59 <colinclark> it\'s worth a shot, anyway
2017-05-26T21:48:03 <Bosmon7> Yes, it was written by that lippy unicode-toter : P
2017-05-26T21:48:08 <colinclark> lippy!
2017-05-26T21:48:28 <colinclark> \xf0\x9f\x90\x85\xf0\x9f\x90\x85\xf0\x9f\x90\x85\xf0\x9f\xa6\x87
2017-05-26T21:48:38 <simonjb> except, I think the bonang synth might only connect to localhost :(
2017-05-26T21:48:54 <simonjb> checking
2017-05-26T21:48:59 <Bosmon7> ?!
2017-05-26T21:49:06 <colinclark> I guess there\'s some JSON for that :)
2017-05-26T21:49:10 <Bosmon7> "Isn\'t it just a web page?" : P
2017-05-26T21:49:11 <colinclark> the bat character is so much better on Windows than on the Mac
2017-05-26T21:49:15 <colinclark> it\'s a shame you can\'t see it
2017-05-26T21:49:19 <Bosmon7> How could it connect to anything other than the server it was hosted on?
2017-05-26T21:52:14 <Bosmon7> Do I misunderstand how the bonang synth works?
2017-05-26T21:52:44 <simonjb> the bonang synth uses my websocket binding grade
2017-05-26T21:53:01 <simonjb> and that has a default host of "localhost"
2017-05-26T21:53:05 <Bosmon7> Oh I see
2017-05-26T21:53:15 <Bosmon7> It doesn\'t fabricate it from the current page URL?
2017-05-26T21:53:32 <colinclark> good feature request
2017-05-26T21:53:42 <simonjb> it does on the other pages by using
2017-05-26T21:53:44 <simonjb> window.location.hostname
2017-05-26T21:53:52 <simonjb> but the bonang one doesn\'t
2017-05-26T21:53:56 <simonjb> easy to fix though
2017-05-26T21:54:08 <simonjb> I can fix it for you before your demo
2017-05-26T21:54:12 <Bosmon7> Oh great!
2017-05-26T21:54:18 <Bosmon7> Cheers simonjb
2017-05-26T21:54:24 <simonjb> when do you did it for?
2017-05-26T21:54:30 <Bosmon7> I might tinker with it tomorrow
2017-05-26T21:54:35 <Bosmon7> I\'ll probably do the demo on Wednesday
2017-05-26T21:54:51 <colinclark> If you have the time, I\'d recommend trying to show a snippet of the video, too
2017-05-26T21:54:56 <Bosmon7> yes
2017-05-26T21:54:57 <colinclark> it\'s puts things into context in a nice way
2017-05-26T21:55:04 <colinclark> either video, actually
2017-05-26T21:55:04 <Bosmon7> The pH one you mean?
2017-05-26T21:55:10 <colinclark> I meant the music one
2017-05-26T21:55:12 <Bosmon7> ok
2017-05-26T21:55:14 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I can look at it tomorrow, to make the synth run on remote machine
2017-05-26T21:55:16 <colinclark> but there\'s a short science lab one
2017-05-26T21:55:24 <Bosmon7> Ah cool
2017-05-26T21:55:26 <colinclark> which you might be able to squeeze in
2017-05-26T21:55:30 <colinclark> let me get you that URL, since I didn\'t publish it
2017-05-26T21:55:35 <Bosmon7> Amazingly they don\'t seem to have actually finalised the format for next week yet
2017-05-26T21:55:54 <Bosmon7> It\'s great to know that there are folks comparably swamped as us : P
2017-05-26T21:56:31 <colinclark> this is the shorter, 6 minute version of the science lab video, Bosmon7: https://youtu.be/7p5xirWT2oI
2017-05-26T21:56:57 <colinclark> And the longer cut, which is 12.5 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNwc0VYRhUU
2017-05-26T21:57:07 <colinclark> the latter, obviously, is much cooler
2017-05-26T21:57:29 <Bosmon7> great
2017-05-26T21:57:33 <Bosmon7> All going into my GOGOL DOCK
2017-05-26T21:58:08 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I will work on the Bonang synth tomorrow and then check in with you -- let me know if you have other issues
2017-05-26T21:58:23 <Bosmon7> Cheers
2017-05-26T21:58:28 <Bosmon7> This is all working amazingly well
2017-05-26T21:58:53 <Bosmon7> The number of steps required to make it work, though, is simply astonishing : P
2017-05-26T21:59:56 <simonjb> Bosmon7: yes, I know; in the next release of AsTeRICS, it will be easier as the Nexus connector will be part of the distro
2017-05-26T22:00:03 <simonjb> then no need to build the ARE
2017-05-26T22:00:07 <Bosmon7> Even by the standards of 2006-era Sakai apps : P
2017-05-26T22:00:13 <Bosmon7> Cool
2017-05-26T22:00:24 <Bosmon7> We can\'t take them seriously then, when they say that 2.8 will be the "final release of Asterics"?
2017-05-26T22:00:31 <simonjb> and no need to download the component collection either (I think) as it should be part of the ACS also
2017-05-26T22:00:32 <Bosmon7> Or is this just a Teutonism for "latest"?
2017-05-26T22:01:23 <simonjb> where does it say "final release"
2017-05-26T22:01:41 <Bosmon7> Oh i see, it just says "This is the final release of Asterics 2.8"
2017-05-26T22:02:04 <simonjb> ah
2017-05-26T22:02:40 <simonjb> not sure when the next release will be but it will make life easier
2017-05-26T22:02:46 <Bosmon7> Well, thanks so much guys, for your help
2017-05-26T22:02:52 <Bosmon7> This is going to be a really great demo
2017-05-26T22:02:56 <simonjb> glad you got it working :)
2017-05-26T22:02:58 <Bosmon7> Assuming it stays working at least as well as this : P
2017-05-26T22:03:07 <simonjb> I
2017-05-26T22:03:13 <simonjb> will be in touch tomorrow
2017-05-26T22:03:35 <Bosmon7> Thanks so much, simonjb - no rush
2017-05-26T22:03:41 <Bosmon7> We have at least a whole day in hand :)
2017-05-26T22:06:03 <simonjb> Bosmon7: cool
2017-05-26T22:40:44 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-05-26T22:54:08 * Justin_o has quit
2017-05-26T23:08:30 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-05-26T23:20:47 * Bosmon7 has quit
2017-05-26T23:48:11 * stegru has quit
'

b'2017-05-26T21:10:04 <Bosmon7> Being confused by the fact that I\'ve replaced the abominable Microsoft find.exe with the Cygwin one
2017-05-26T21:12:30 <colinclark> FIND JAVA BAT
2017-05-26T21:12:50 <Bosmon7> ooooh
2017-05-26T21:12:52 <Bosmon7> It started something
2017-05-26T21:13:10 <Bosmon7> After I hacked around the BAT file to make the totally reasonable assumption that java is available under the name "java"
2017-05-26T21:13:25 <Bosmon7> But I then have some kind of "deployment error"
2017-05-26T21:13:26 <simonjb> you did what!
2017-05-26T21:13:49 <colinclark> oh man
2017-05-26T21:13:54 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I had to edit the start.bat file by hand
2017-05-26T21:13:57 <colinclark> i can\'t believe you\'re poking the java bat
2017-05-26T21:13:59 <colinclark> those things bite
2017-05-26T21:14:06 <simonjb> :)
2017-05-26T21:14:23 <Bosmon7> Well what else could I do, it was written by dimwits who expect to call Microsoft find.exe in order to find the totally bleeding obvious
2017-05-26T21:14:38 <simonjb> (I also edited the bat file)
2017-05-26T21:14:45 <Bosmon7> I did now get a warning: "64 bit Java Runtime detected: Many plugins of the ARE need a 32bit Java Runtime"
2017-05-26T21:14:53 <Bosmon7> But nonetheless a UI seems to have started up
2017-05-26T21:14:56 <Bosmon7> What do I do now?
2017-05-26T21:15:03 <colinclark> Can\'t you just download it from the Windows App Store?
2017-05-26T21:15:10 <colinclark> maybe for like $9.99?
2017-05-26T21:15:12 <Bosmon7> Yes
2017-05-26T21:15:17 <Bosmon7> Have you been drinking this evening? : P
2017-05-26T21:15:28 <simonjb> or free-to-play
2017-05-26T21:15:38 <Bosmon7> I\'m sure you received much less heckling than this when you had to install your own demo in a last-minute rush :)
2017-05-26T21:15:45 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-05-26T21:15:53 <Bosmon7> So, what do I do with this UI?
2017-05-26T21:16:00 <colinclark> well, the heckling reduces the closer you get to the moment of presenting
2017-05-26T21:16:08 <colinclark> and no, no drinking :P
2017-05-26T21:16:18 <simonjb> Bosmon7: connect to ARE
2017-05-26T21:16:30 <colinclark> I am as sober as a Javanese fruit bat before breakfast
2017-05-26T21:16:36 <Bosmon7> simonjb - dunno what that means
2017-05-26T21:16:47 <Bosmon7> I see a childish-looking UI with black buttons on a blue background
2017-05-26T21:16:56 <Bosmon7> With "Welcome to AsTeRICS!" written at the top
2017-05-26T21:17:06 <Bosmon7> There are 7 options
2017-05-26T21:17:21 <Bosmon7> With "Choose or deploy a model" written in red at the bottom
2017-05-26T21:17:22 <simonjb> Bosmon7: should we vidyo? maybe we can do a screenshare?
2017-05-26T21:17:30 <simonjb> that might be the quickest
2017-05-26T21:17:36 <Bosmon7> simonjb - pretty hard, since vidyo is on a different machine to the one I am running
2017-05-26T21:17:43 <simonjb> ah, ok
2017-05-26T21:17:45 <Bosmon7> I guess I can try to install it.........
2017-05-26T21:18:00 <colinclark> can\'t you use just the WebRTC interface?
2017-05-26T21:18:02 <simonjb> in the ACS, there should be a toolbar button to connect the ACS to the ARE
2017-05-26T21:18:08 <Bosmon7> ah I see
2017-05-26T21:18:13 <Bosmon7> In the ACS
2017-05-26T21:18:14 <Bosmon7> ok then
2017-05-26T21:18:20 <colinclark> I think if you just go to our Vidyo portal without the client, there should be an option to join without donwloading anything
2017-05-26T21:18:27 <Bosmon7> OK
2017-05-26T21:18:30 <Bosmon7> I pressed the button
2017-05-26T21:18:36 <Bosmon7> It is now greyed out : P
2017-05-26T21:18:40 <Bosmon7> So I assume I am connected
2017-05-26T21:18:46 <Bosmon7> There was other than that no feedback
2017-05-26T21:18:52 <simonjb> now there should be button to download plugin connection
2017-05-26T21:19:06 <Bosmon7> Oh yes, in tiny writing at the bottom it now says ARE Status: Connected
2017-05-26T21:19:10 <simonjb> sorry "collection"
2017-05-26T21:19:21 <simonjb> download plugin collection
2017-05-26T21:19:52 <Bosmon7> I see "Download Component Collection"
2017-05-26T21:19:55 <Bosmon7> Is this the one?
2017-05-26T21:19:57 <simonjb> yes
2017-05-26T21:20:17 <simonjb> sorry I don\'t have it running and am trying to remember the names
2017-05-26T21:20:29 <Bosmon7> Ok
2017-05-26T21:20:30 <colinclark> THAT\'S THE ONE I ALWAYS FORGET
2017-05-26T21:20:30 <Bosmon7> I do this
2017-05-26T21:20:36 <simonjb> it should display a dialog box when it\'s done
2017-05-26T21:20:37 <Bosmon7> The ARE window hangs for a while and goes completely blue
2017-05-26T21:20:42 <Bosmon7> Yes, now there is a modal dialog
2017-05-26T21:20:48 <simonjb> ok
2017-05-26T21:20:52 <Bosmon7> "The new component collection from the ARE has been set to the components menu"
2017-05-26T21:21:00 <Bosmon7> Unintelligibly :)
2017-05-26T21:21:17 <Bosmon7> The ARE is now completely blue with a button toolbar at the right
2017-05-26T21:21:26 <Bosmon7> This is worse than the most baffling INFOCOM adventure
2017-05-26T21:21:37 <simonjb> now open the file: https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-demos/blob/master/asterics-models/Facetracker to NexusConnector.acs
2017-05-26T21:21:40 <Bosmon7> !!!!!!!!!
2017-05-26T21:21:41 <simonjb> in the ACS
2017-05-26T21:21:45 <Bosmon7> !!!!!!!!!!!
2017-05-26T21:21:54 <Bosmon7> Using..... "open model"? or what
2017-05-26T21:21:57 <simonjb> from your disk
2017-05-26T21:22:01 <Bosmon7> from my disk!
2017-05-26T21:22:08 <simonjb> yes
2017-05-26T21:22:12 <simonjb> open model
2017-05-26T21:22:12 <Bosmon7> or "load model from storage"?
2017-05-26T21:23:35 <Bosmon7> I opened it using "open model"
2017-05-26T21:23:41 <Bosmon7> A kind of boxes and wires diagram has appeared
2017-05-26T21:24:20 <colinclark> There it is, the model
2017-05-26T21:24:32 <Bosmon7> Ok
2017-05-26T21:24:35 <colinclark> which will track your face and send its coordinates to the Nexus
2017-05-26T21:24:38 <Bosmon7> How do I make it actually do something?
2017-05-26T21:24:51 <colinclark> The next step is probably to update the IP address of the NexusConnector component there in the model
2017-05-26T21:24:53 <simonjb> upload model in the ACS
2017-05-26T21:25:01 <colinclark> or does it default to localhost?
2017-05-26T21:25:07 <simonjb> ah yes
2017-05-26T21:25:15 <simonjb> I think it defaults to localhost
2017-05-26T21:25:18 <colinclark> great
2017-05-26T21:25:19 <simonjb> but check
2017-05-26T21:25:25 <simonjb> it make sure
2017-05-26T21:25:26 <Bosmon7> Where would I edit it if I wanted to change it
2017-05-26T21:25:26 <colinclark> i\'ll go back to the peanut gallery now
2017-05-26T21:25:35 <Bosmon7> I\'ve highlighted the box named "nexusConnector.2"
2017-05-26T21:25:38 <Bosmon7> Is this right?
2017-05-26T21:25:42 <simonjb> yes
2017-05-26T21:25:49 <simonjb> and then there\'s a property list on the right
2017-05-26T21:25:54 <Bosmon7> Yes
2017-05-26T21:25:59 <simonjb> with nexus connection values
2017-05-26T21:26:02 <simonjb> host
2017-05-26T21:26:05 <Bosmon7> I don\'t obviously see ont that refers to an IP address
2017-05-26T21:26:07 <Bosmon7> Or host
2017-05-26T21:26:17 <Bosmon7> Oh wait
2017-05-26T21:26:18 <Bosmon7> I see
2017-05-26T21:26:23 <Bosmon7> I didn\'t understand the UI selection model
2017-05-26T21:26:36 <Bosmon7> The orange border is not a selection highlight : P
2017-05-26T21:26:40 <Bosmon7> The blue outline is
2017-05-26T21:26:46 <Bosmon7> Yes, it has defaulted to localhost
2017-05-26T21:26:49 <Bosmon7> And the correct port
2017-05-26T21:26:52 <simonjb> cool
2017-05-26T21:27:00 <simonjb> now upload the model
2017-05-26T21:27:07 <simonjb> in the ACS
2017-05-26T21:27:15 <simonjb> another toolbar button
2017-05-26T21:27:19 <Bosmon7> argh
2017-05-26T21:27:24 <Bosmon7> It has said "Error sending model to ARE"
2017-05-26T21:27:24 <simonjb> this will send the model to the ARE
2017-05-26T21:27:30 <simonjb> :(
2017-05-26T21:28:44 <simonjb> anything in the ARE console output? where you ran the ARE start.bat from
2017-05-26T21:28:50 <Bosmon7> a NullPointerException
2017-05-26T21:28:57 <colinclark> \xf0\x9f\xa6\x87
2017-05-26T21:29:09 <simonjb> drat
2017-05-26T21:29:12 <Bosmon7> I think it is just not liking my 64-bit JVM
2017-05-26T21:29:20 <simonjb> yes, maybe
2017-05-26T21:29:28 <simonjb> darn
2017-05-26T21:29:30 <Bosmon7> Earlier on I got a SEVERE failure saying "IO Exception while handling ignore ports file"
2017-05-26T21:29:39 <colinclark> ouch
2017-05-26T21:29:51 <simonjb> you might need to install 32-bit
2017-05-26T21:29:58 <Bosmon7> Aha
2017-05-26T21:30:05 <simonjb> sorry Antranig
2017-05-26T21:30:07 <Bosmon7> there was a failure from the facetracker itself
2017-05-26T21:30:18 <simonjb> ah
2017-05-26T21:30:25 <simonjb> bitness or something else?
2017-05-26T21:30:37 <Bosmon7> "native/facetrackerLK.dll: Can\'t load IA 32-bit .dll on a AMD 64-bit platform"
2017-05-26T21:30:58 <Bosmon7> God knows why it claims this is an AMD 64-bit platform given this is my Lenovo Thinkpad : P
2017-05-26T21:31:00 <Bosmon7> But there it is
2017-05-26T21:31:07 <Bosmon7> I\'ll try to install the recommended JDK this time
2017-05-26T21:33:30 <Bosmon7> Oh wow
2017-05-26T21:33:35 <Bosmon7> It installs it nested in its own directory
2017-05-26T21:33:42 <Bosmon7> That is enormously civilised of it
2017-05-26T21:35:51 <Bosmon7> Ok, I have hacked start.bat some more
2017-05-26T21:35:54 <Bosmon7> This is looking rather more healthy
2017-05-26T21:37:48 <colinclark> \xf0\x9f\xa6\x87\xf0\x9f\xa6\x87\xf0\x9f\xa6\x87
2017-05-26T21:38:11 <Bosmon7> ok
2017-05-26T21:38:15 <Bosmon7> I have run UPLOAD MODEL without error
2017-05-26T21:38:18 <Bosmon7> I now see a blue square
2017-05-26T21:38:31 <simonjb> now start model also in ACS
2017-05-26T21:38:31 <colinclark> BLUE!
2017-05-26T21:38:44 <Bosmon7> ok

2017-05-26T20:17:25 <Bosmon7> So looks like simonjb isn\'t around at the moment
2017-05-26T20:17:32 <Bosmon7> But I notice the asterics site is back up again
2017-05-26T20:17:37 <Bosmon7> Do you happen to know what I need to download?
2017-05-26T20:17:46 <Bosmon7> http://www.asterics.eu/index.php?id=50
2017-05-26T20:17:53 <Bosmon7> Do I just get "stable release" from here?
2017-05-26T20:17:58 <Bosmon7> And once I have installed it, what happens next?
2017-05-26T20:18:49 <alanharnum> Bosmon7: are you looking to run the Nexus demos that use AsTeRICS?
2017-05-26T20:21:53 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-05-26T20:24:30 <colinclark> hiya Bosmon7
2017-05-26T20:24:34 <colinclark> simonjb is here too
2017-05-26T20:24:48 <colinclark> Asterics is always fun to get set up
2017-05-26T20:24:58 <colinclark> alanharnum: yup, he\'s trying to get set up with the musical demonstration
2017-05-26T20:29:58 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I think you may (simonjb can correct) have to build yourself to get a version that has the Nexus connectors
2017-05-26T20:30:24 <alanharnum> they appear to be in the latest master at https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/tree/master/ARE/components/processor.nexusconnector, but aren\'t in the 2.8 tag: https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/tree/v2.8/ARE/components/processor.nexusconnector
2017-05-26T20:30:53 <simonjb> the AsTeRICS website is back up
2017-05-26T20:30:54 <simonjb> http://www.asterics.eu/index.php?id=88
2017-05-26T20:31:31 <simonjb> I think you will need to install the 2.8 version and then build a custom ARE from github
2017-05-26T20:31:57 <simonjb> the master branch should be good for the ARE
2017-05-26T20:33:47 <Bosmon7> Ok, thanks simonjb
2017-05-26T20:33:55 <Bosmon7> I\'ll give it a try
2017-05-26T20:34:31 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/releases/tag/v2.8
2017-05-26T20:34:34 <Bosmon7> So.....
2017-05-26T20:34:42 <simonjb> no
2017-05-26T20:34:54 <simonjb> install 2.8 from the website
2017-05-26T20:34:57 <Bosmon7> Oh
2017-05-26T20:35:04 <Bosmon7> I followed this link from the website
2017-05-26T20:35:07 <simonjb> ah
2017-05-26T20:35:08 <Bosmon7> I assumed it was the installer : P
2017-05-26T20:35:09 <simonjb> sorry
2017-05-26T20:35:13 <simonjb> you are right
2017-05-26T20:35:26 <simonjb> it links to github
2017-05-26T20:35:33 <Bosmon7> So there\'s an exe
2017-05-26T20:35:38 <simonjb> yes, that
2017-05-26T20:37:45 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-05-26T20:40:41 <Bosmon7> It says that it will install a Java
2017-05-26T20:40:44 <Bosmon7> Which is rather upsetting : P
2017-05-26T20:40:54 <Bosmon7> I guess i can\'t really avoid it
2017-05-26T20:43:53 <colinclark> Bosmon7: Are there ways to run Java applications without Java?
2017-05-26T20:44:01 <colinclark> that would be a cool feature that Oracle could add
2017-05-26T20:44:49 <Bosmon7> Yes colinclark
2017-05-26T20:44:59 <Bosmon7> By my remark, I meant to signify... *another* Java : p
2017-05-26T20:45:32 <Bosmon7> In addition to the one that time has brought me to love and honour as installed on my machine
2017-05-26T20:45:34 <colinclark> zomg
2017-05-26T20:45:37 <colinclark> multiple Javas
2017-05-26T20:45:41 <colinclark> I thought one was bad enough
2017-05-26T20:45:59 <colinclark> how many malware toolbars can one install on a Windows machine at once, after all?
2017-05-26T20:46:17 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-05-26T20:47:20 <Bosmon7> Ah, I can skip the Java bit
2017-05-26T20:47:21 <Bosmon7> Great
2017-05-26T20:48:32 <alanharnum> "Multiple Javas", sung to the tune of "Eleanor Rigby"
2017-05-26T20:48:47 <Bosmon7> If only I could leave their teeth in a jar by the door
2017-05-26T20:50:04 <Bosmon7> "Who is it for" sum\'s up Oracle\'s Java perfectly :)
2017-05-26T20:57:24 <Bosmon7> ok simonjb
2017-05-26T20:57:28 <Bosmon7> So I\'ve installed the exe
2017-05-26T20:57:37 <Bosmon7> And I\'ve run the ant build for my checkout of asterics
2017-05-26T20:57:40 <Bosmon7> What do I do next?
2017-05-26T20:57:41 <simonjb> awesome
2017-05-26T20:58:06 <Bosmon7> It appears to have stuck a JAR in asterics/bin/ARE
2017-05-26T20:58:07 <simonjb> do you have the Nexus running and the music config loaded?
2017-05-26T20:58:12 <Bosmon7> I assume this is crucial
2017-05-26T20:58:44 <Bosmon7> Yup, Nexus is running with music
2017-05-26T20:58:49 <simonjb> great
2017-05-26T20:58:57 <simonjb> now start the ACS
2017-05-26T20:59:05 <Bosmon7> how!
2017-05-26T20:59:20 <colinclark> all the lonely Java people
2017-05-26T20:59:31 <Bosmon7> Hahaha
2017-05-26T20:59:34 <simonjb> did the installer make an entry in your start menu or on your desktop?
2017-05-26T20:59:39 <Bosmon7> I just got my accidental joke
2017-05-26T20:59:45 <Bosmon7> The teeth are in a JAR by the door :)
2017-05-26T20:59:52 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-05-26T20:59:59 <simonjb> :)
2017-05-26T21:00:11 <colinclark> one that you have to decompile in order to change the colour of the teeth
2017-05-26T21:00:20 <Bosmon7> yes precisely
2017-05-26T21:00:26 <Bosmon7> Ok yes, I have a programs entry for the ACS
2017-05-26T21:00:29 <Bosmon7> Which I have now started
2017-05-26T21:00:34 <colinclark> OK NOW
2017-05-26T21:00:36 <Bosmon7> I never thought it would be something so direct : P
2017-05-26T21:00:41 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-05-26T21:00:44 <Bosmon7> They have some pretty nice icons
2017-05-26T21:00:52 <Bosmon7> Let me add all these steps to our google doc
2017-05-26T21:01:28 <colinclark> Look at him working, darning his class hierarchy in the night when there\'s nobody there
2017-05-26T21:01:43 <colinclark> story of my life as a Java programmer
2017-05-26T21:01:47 <simonjb> next, run the ARE that you compiled yourself -- not the one installed by the installer
2017-05-26T21:02:22 <Bosmon7> ok
2017-05-26T21:02:36 <simonjb> I think it\'s bin/ARE/start.bat
2017-05-26T21:03:09 <Bosmon7> There is actually a bin/ARE/ARE.exe
2017-05-26T21:03:11 <Bosmon7> Should I try that?
2017-05-26T21:03:48 <simonjb> I don\'t think I ever tried that, maybe
2017-05-26T21:03:57 <Bosmon7> There is a start.bat too
2017-05-26T21:04:08 <simonjb> let\'s do the start.bat
2017-05-26T21:04:23 <Bosmon7> ok
2017-05-26T21:05:10 <Bosmon7> It has failed, for some reason
2017-05-26T21:06:07 <Bosmon7> My guess is there is some missing environment variable
2017-05-26T21:07:58 * amatas has quit
2017-05-26T21:09:37 <Bosmon7> It\'s this findjava.bat nonsense
