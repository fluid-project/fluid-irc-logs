b'2017-12-09T00:04:50 <Bosmon> gmoss, hey there :)
2017-12-09T00:05:14 <Bosmon> Well, think about what is going on here - the framework tries its best, but it isn\'t magic
2017-12-09T00:05:29 <Bosmon> After your assertEquals has executed on line 27, how could you possibly still be in time to intercept the change event on line 31?
2017-12-09T00:06:21 <Bosmon> In order to assure that it *is* in time, the IoC testing framework always ensures to bind an event listener which follows an action BEFORE the action begins
2017-12-09T00:06:41 <Bosmon> But if there are two actions in a row, it can\'t possibly skip back any further
2017-12-09T00:07:14 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps this is a kind of usability issue... but currently the "event horizon" of the system is one single sequence element
2017-12-09T00:07:52 <Bosmon> I guess there are grounds for saying that "any number of actions in a row" should be treated as a block, just as we should treat "any number of listeners in a row"
2017-12-09T00:08:11 <Bosmon> But currently the system has foresight for just one

2017-12-09T17:45:52 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone else, I am noodling around with a side project that uses infusion, and just figured out why my event bindings weren\'t working:
2017-12-09T17:45:52 <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.pastiebin.com/5a2c211fa4927
2017-12-09T17:46:20 <the-t-in-rtf> The array syntax used to work and was adapted from instructions from Dr. Bos back in the day.
2017-12-09T17:46:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Has that behaviour changed in the last year or so?

2017-12-09T19:57:30 <Bosmon> To answer the-t-in-rtf \'s question from earlier - the syntax in the pastie could only have ever worked through a bug
2017-12-09T19:57:43 <Bosmon> The whole purpose of namespaced listeners is that at most one can ever be bound at a time
