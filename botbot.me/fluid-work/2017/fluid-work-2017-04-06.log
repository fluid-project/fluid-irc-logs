2017-04-06T12:32:47 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for the invite to Snyk, can you tell me more about what it is
2017-04-06T12:34:06 <gtirloni> it\'s a service that can monitor our repositories and PR looking for vulnerable node packages.. it\'s free (and unlimited for open source projects). it can warn when our repos have dependencies with new vulnerabilities as well as add a warnings to PRs with them
2017-04-06T12:35:32 <gtirloni> there was a discussion on the gpii-arch mailing list
2017-04-06T12:36:32 <gtirloni> actually, the discussion has been going on since oct 2015 :) i can\'t find a way to list all posts, because the span multiple months
2017-04-06T12:37:50 <gtirloni> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2015-November/thread.html
2017-04-06T12:37:55 <gtirloni> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2017-April/thread.html
2017-04-06T12:37:58 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay, so it looks at the dependencies and sees if there are any known volnerabilities, but it doesn\'t check your code itself for security issues
2017-04-06T12:38:25 <gtirloni> exactly, it\'s not a static code analyzer
2017-04-06T12:38:34 <gtirloni> "Snyk continuously finds and fixes vulnerabilities in your dependencies."
2017-04-06T12:38:45 <gtirloni> https://snyk.io/docs/faqs/
2017-04-06T12:39:32 <gtirloni> it\'s seem like an effortless way to improve our process
2017-04-06T12:40:14 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2017-04-06T12:40:15 <gtirloni> as tony mentioned, some people already use snyk/yarn to check for outdated packages but this would add a more visible checkmark to the commits/PRs
2017-04-06T12:41:03 <gtirloni> I don\'t have admin access to the Fluid or GPII orgs, so I\'ve added people to the Snyk orgs in advance, so people can take a look and add the repositories
2017-04-06T12:41:52 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah okay, was there a decision made already to use it, or is it still in the discussion phase, particularly for infusion
2017-04-06T12:42:09 <gtirloni> no decision, I\'ll cross post to fluid-work
2017-04-06T12:42:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: cool thanks
2017-04-06T12:49:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Cheers, @gtirloni, I set up the local copies of my repos with snyk.  Love the dashboard.
2017-04-06T12:52:25 <gtirloni> nice! it\'s pretty easy to use too.. one thing I haven\'t explored is the automatic patching, that seems interesting but I\'m afraid of making code changes through it :)
2017-04-06T12:55:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m with you there, although given our reliance on some fairly old packages, it\'s nice to have the option.
2017-04-06T12:55:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I really like that the CLI lets you report on someone else\'s package *before you install it*
2017-04-06T12:56:16 <gtirloni> yep, that\'s awesome
2017-04-06T12:56:54 <gtirloni> otherwise you\'d have to hunt that package down, find the repo, if they have a security-notification process, where are the advisories, etc... it\'s a lot of work and it\'s always different for each package :(

2017-04-06T17:29:05 <alanharnum> Sent an email to fluid-work about this, but signal boosting here: https://changelog.com/rfc - interesting podcast I came across recently on open source sustainability / human factors in open source
2017-04-06T17:29:19 <alanharnum> Justin_o michelled in particular ^
2017-04-06T17:30:17 <alanharnum> episode 5, which I was listening to on commute, is with the Read the Docs creator, talking about non-code contributions to open source (specifically documentation, but also touches upon design - he credits good design with a lot of Read the Docs success).
2017-04-06T17:37:22 <michelled> thanks alanharnum
