b'2017-01-12T17:40:04 <mrtyler> i think it\'s better if "a build" remains focused on one square in the matrix
2017-01-12T17:40:05 <gloob> or something like, vagrant -THEWINDOWS8MACHINE up
2017-01-12T17:40:27 <mrtyler> and then use the CI framework (or whatever) to spin up one "build" per os
2017-01-12T17:40:32 <mrtyler> or os/npm version/... combo
2017-01-12T17:40:39 <gloob> we have more
2017-01-12T17:40:45 <gloob> we have os/bitness
2017-01-12T17:40:49 <mrtyler> sure
2017-01-12T17:40:57 <mrtyler> my point is that you don\'t combine 32-bit and 64-bit in the same build
2017-01-12T17:41:16 <mrtyler> handle them separately, ideally in parallel
2017-01-12T17:41:26 <gloob> sure
2017-01-12T17:41:35 <amatas> 4 OSes * 2 bitness = 8 environments
2017-01-12T17:41:39 <stegru> some of my bugs have required a real 32-bit machine, rather than running node32
2017-01-12T17:41:45 <stegru> ..on 64
2017-01-12T17:41:54 <gloob> stegru: I feel you, bro
2017-01-12T17:41:57 <gloob> :)
2017-01-12T17:42:12 <mrtyler> actually here\'s a question: do we have one set of powershell that works on all windows versions and bitnesses? or are there separate scripts? or a lot of "if win7: do X; if win8: do Y; ..." ?
2017-01-12T17:42:38 <mrtyler> stegru: i\'ve seen that, even though i suspect microsoft enthusiasts would tell you such a situation is "impossible" ;)
2017-01-12T17:42:43 * danayo joined the channel
2017-01-12T17:42:45 <amatas> stegru, couldn\'t  you reproduce the bug in a 32-bit VM?
2017-01-12T17:42:55 <gloob> we have a provisioning set of powershell scripts, that are ready for take into account bitnesses but at the moment is just Windows 10/64 bits with nodejs in 32 bits mode oriented
2017-01-12T17:43:22 <mrtyler> gloob: so exactly one square in the matrix?
2017-01-12T17:43:35 <mrtyler> and no testing of 64 bit nodejs on 64 bit windows?
2017-01-12T17:43:42 <gloob> probably a lot of switchs or more probably one special file by version
2017-01-12T17:43:48 <stegru> sorry, when i said "real" i mean "really 32bit, not 32bit node on 64bit" - vm was fine
2017-01-12T17:44:00 <amatas> ok, understood
2017-01-12T17:44:22 <mrtyler> gloob: i think that\'s pretty unfortunate / exactly why it would be good to use a "real" CM tool (e.g. ansible)
2017-01-12T17:44:41 <mrtyler> that abstracts out the differences between win7/win8/win10
2017-01-12T17:44:54 <gloob> mrtyler: anyway at the moment is fully speculative, we need to close the circle
2017-01-12T17:44:58 <amatas> mrtyler, the pain is that there are different versions of powershell between environments
2017-01-12T17:45:09 <amatas> for example chocolatey doesn\'t run fine in windows 7
2017-01-12T17:45:32 <stegru> mrtyler: personally, I provision my machines using a shitty batch file. i then take a snapshot so i don\'t need to do it again
2017-01-12T17:45:33 <amatas> which makes the actual powershell scripts useless
2017-01-12T17:45:41 <mrtyler> gloob: agreed. i don\'t want to drive this but maybe avtar or amatas can add it to the agenda for an appropriate meeting?
2017-01-12T17:45:58 <mrtyler> stegru: i would love for you to not have to do that :)
2017-01-12T17:46:16 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2017-01-12T17:46:16 <mrtyler> amatas: that\'s pretty annoying
2017-01-12T17:46:33 <mrtyler> amatas: do you think the situation would be better if we had ansible doing the work instead of custom PS?
2017-01-12T17:46:50 <stegru> me too, mrtyler, but i add my own things to it. for the "official" vagrant box, i do use "vagrant up".. but i then add my own things to it
2017-01-12T17:46:59 <mrtyler> i think you were on board when we talked about this the other day
2017-01-12T17:47:06 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2017-01-12T17:47:13 <mrtyler> stegru: interesting. what kind of "your own things"?
2017-01-12T17:47:24 <gloob> mrtyler: I suggest to add to the agenda of next devops meeting
2017-01-12T17:47:25 <mrtyler> stuff to make ad-hoc testing easier i guess?
2017-01-12T17:47:54 <mrtyler> gloob: that seems like a good place to discuss. let\'s see if i can find where that agenda lives...
2017-01-12T17:48:04 <gloob> mrtyler: in the collective brain
2017-01-12T17:48:09 <mrtyler> :(
2017-01-12T17:48:22 <stegru> cygwin, nfs, windows remote debugger, textpad
2017-01-12T17:48:28 <gloob> gtirloni: do we have an agenda for the devops meeting somewhere?
2017-01-12T17:50:08 <mrtyler> stegru: so i guess cygwin/textpad to make things more comfortable inside the vm, winrdb for debugging, and nfs for sharing files b/t host and guest?
2017-01-12T17:50:08 <amatas> mrtyler, I think that use Ansible it\'s almost the same as PS because it uses PS internally: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/modules/windows
2017-01-12T17:50:39 <mrtyler> amatas: but *we* don\'t have to write the PS. someone has done it for us. that\'s a huge win in my book
2017-01-12T17:50:39 * yzen_ has quit
2017-01-12T17:50:55 <mrtyler> i\'m not worried about PS as a technology. i\'m worried about the liability of us having to write PS
2017-01-12T17:51:19 <stegru> mrtyler: yes. but, don\'t bother thinking about including that in a box for me
2017-01-12T17:51:34 <mrtyler> instead i\'d prefer us to focus on writing ansible, which we already do anyway
2017-01-12T17:51:48 <gloob> plus one
2017-01-12T17:52:02 <mrtyler> stegru: right, those don\'t belong in production so they don\'t belong in the "official" vm that is supposed to act like production
2017-01-12T17:52:04 <gloob> and if you need to write PS write in the ansible context and get it upstream
2017-01-12T17:52:14 <mrtyler> ^ yup
2017-01-12T17:52:34 <stegru> mrtyler: ok good - i wasn\'t making a request, just saying what i do
2017-01-12T17:52:51 <mrtyler> stegru: yup, totally. and i\'m trying to understand your workflow a bit so that\'s helpful
2017-01-12T17:52:51 <gloob> I need to leave, catch you later
2017-01-12T17:52:58 <mrtyler> bye ale
2017-01-12T17:53:22 <stegru> manana
2017-01-12T17:53:22 <mrtyler> stegru: i guess it would be nice if the QI stuff made it easy for you to add those pieces for local testing?
2017-01-12T17:53:27 <gloob> stegru: que?
2017-01-12T17:53:41 <stegru> ke?
2017-01-12T17:53:47 <amatas> haha
2017-01-12T17:54:01 <stegru> mrtyler: erm...
2017-01-12T17:54:12 <mrtyler> stegru: do you ever worry about invalidating your testing by changing the environment? say, if your code accidentally relies on something installed by winrdb?
2017-01-12T17:54:36 <mrtyler> or i guess you could rely on the CI system to catch that kind of problem
2017-01-12T17:54:48 <amatas> well, ansible can be used as a normal python module. I\'m assuming that we could get most of features of Ansible if we only run it locally using a python script.
2017-01-12T17:55:07 <stegru> yes definately, mrtyler. it\'s on my mind, so i use snapshots for the vm. "very clean" and "workable"
2017-01-12T17:55:28 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-01-12T17:55:38 <mrtyler> amatas: "Note running Ansible from a Windows control machine is NOT a goal of the project. Refrain from asking for this feature, as it limits what technologies, features, and code we can use in the main project in the future. A Linux control machine will be required to manage Windows hosts.
2017-01-12T17:55:45 <mrtyler> --http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_windows.html
2017-01-12T17:55:56 <mrtyler> so i\'m not sure your statement is accurate
2017-01-12T17:56:18 <stegru> i don\'t use "vagrant up" (except for provisioning the win10) to re-create windows, because it just takes too long. so i take a snapshot on the first install, and just roll-back.
2017-01-12T17:56:30 <mrtyler> stegru: aha. interesting
2017-01-12T17:57:06 * Kobi joined the channel
2017-01-12T17:57:34 <stegru> which reminds me, i also disable auto-updates - otherwise the stupid thing installs updates as soon as i power it up
2017-01-12T17:57:49 <amatas> yes, I know I mean something like this but in a windows host: https://serversforhackers.com/running-ansible-programmatically
2017-01-12T17:59:01 <amatas> stegru, all that info seems very useful for me, as we can build a windows VM with all the tools needed to avoid provisioning time.
2017-01-12T18:00:04 <stegru> amatas: good, but for me my provisioning time is a one-off thing
2017-01-12T18:00:57 <stegru> it\'s only when you roll out a new vagrant box. my 7, 8.1, and other 10 vms are already done, and i just revert to the "fresh" snapshot

2017-01-12T18:01:35 <mrtyler> amatas: i only skimmed it but that looks pretty hacky to me. regardless, i\'m more concerned with the WHAT (use powershell or ansible or something else for windows CM) than the HOW (implementation details of making ansible or powershell or something else do windows CM)

2017-01-12T18:04:13 <stegru> sorry my wife is shouting me down for tea, i can describe my whole work-flow in an email if you\'re that interested.. but as far as i\'m concerned i\'m already happy with what I have
2017-01-12T18:05:03 <amatas> ok thanks stegru, that email is not necessary ATM
2017-01-12T18:05:12 <mrtyler> agreed, just looking for some background

2017-01-12T18:05:36 <stegru> ok. i\'m not a normal use-case anyway
2017-01-12T18:05:44 <amatas> mrtyler, I only was proposing solutions with the tools that we actually use.
2017-01-12T18:06:09 <mrtyler> amatas: sure, except we don\'t actually use ansible for windows machines ;)
2017-01-12T18:06:13 <mrtyler> (currently)

2017-01-12T18:08:01 <mrtyler> amatas: right, because there kind of aren\'t any :\\
2017-01-12T18:08:26 <mrtyler> even something like MOM is not, afaik, as sophisticated as something like puppet or ansible
2017-01-12T18:08:43 <mrtyler> plus MOM is hella expensive and requires that you drink all the microsoft kool-ade for management
2017-01-12T18:08:50 <amatas> also seems that MS doesn\'t provide a open system to do so
2017-01-12T18:09:05 <mrtyler> at least that\'s how it was. i haven\'t looked at this space in ~5 years or so
2017-01-12T18:22:40 <gtirloni> gloob mrtyler amatas colinclark: there is a folder in the gpii\'s pad for infrastructure meetings (https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/gpii-infrastructure-meetings-iqt4nbr/view).  i\'ve created a pad for the next meeting which we can use to add the topics people want to discuss
2017-01-12T18:23:46 <gtirloni> mrtyler amatas stegru: this is what ansible (and much of MS tools) use behind the scenes: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview
2017-01-12T18:24:17 <Justin_o> clown_mtg: thanks.. so that\'s the results of the tests? is that manually or automatically generated
2017-01-12T18:25:16 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: clown_mtg just shared this with me and it might be useful to you, https://www.w3.org/wiki/ARIA_1.1_Testable_Statements
2017-01-12T18:25:42 <clown_mtg> Justin_o:  that\'s a list of the expected values for the tests.  Not sure if those statements are automatically generated or not.
2017-01-12T18:25:48 <clown_mtg> the results page is elsewhere.
2017-01-12T18:25:53 <Justin_o> clown_mtg: ah okay
2017-01-12T18:25:54 <clown_mtg> I\'ll look for it after my meeting.

2017-01-12T19:12:43 <colinclark> We should use the wiki if possible
2017-01-12T19:13:01 <colinclark> interestingly, I had a fascinating discussion with Gregg today in which he told me "The wiki saved the day!"
2017-01-12T19:13:07 <colinclark> when he was presenting to a funder
2017-01-12T19:13:15 <colinclark> so we should continue to ensure that the wiki saves the day
2017-01-12T19:13:45 <gtirloni> colinclark: for the meeting notes?
2017-01-12T19:14:32 <gtirloni> colinclark: e.g. by referencing them this way too? https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Weekly_Integration_Meeting_Notes
2017-01-12T19:15:40 <colinclark> gtirloni: yup, exactly
2017-01-12T19:15:52 <colinclark> I mean, the sorts of things that usually save the day in the wiki are design documents
2017-01-12T19:16:10 <colinclark> but having access to meeting notes and sketches is a good way to ensure that design documents sprout in the wiki instead of, say, Google Docs
2017-01-12T19:16:11 <colinclark> :)
2017-01-12T19:17:48 <gtirloni> cool, agreed! i\'ll create something for the infra meetings

2017-01-12T16:58:27 <alanharnum> Bosmon / colinclark: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-497 - I\'ve been doing some dependency updating to chartAuthoring and have seen some issues that may exist at the intersection of recent IoC changes and Flocking.
2017-01-12T16:58:32 <alanharnum> any insight would be appreciated.
2017-01-12T16:59:05 <colinclark> which version of Flocking are you using, alanharnum?
2017-01-12T16:59:59 <alanharnum> colinclark: https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/commit/18e94e6fb7a51f0b37c8e69063eb00ff6d1badce - the latest commit hash (this work originated in the email discussion you had w/Avtar & Gio just after i went on vacation pre-break)
2017-01-12T17:00:09 <colinclark> Can you make sure you\'re testing with #5644a8a93df8461ec2596679f51754512f185f8e?
2017-01-12T17:00:21 <colinclark> Flocking\'s master has not yet been updated to Infusion 2.0.0
2017-01-12T17:00:58 <alanharnum> will try that right now
2017-01-12T17:01:00 <colinclark> jhung: My current UX team meeting is running a little late, but I shouldn\'t be too much longer
2017-01-12T17:01:02 <colinclark> thanks
2017-01-12T17:01:08 <colinclark> sorry that Flocking is lagging
2017-01-12T17:01:10 <colinclark> I\'m so close!
2017-01-12T17:01:34 <alanharnum> no worries - i probably should have asked you sooner if there was more recent work than master :p
2017-01-12T17:02:53 <alanharnum> but i did learn more about the IoC internals
2017-01-12T17:03:08 <alanharnum> and i wanted to make sure i knew exactly where the failure was happening
2017-01-12T17:03:29 <colinclark> jhung: Looks like about 5 minutes
2017-01-12T17:03:36 <jhung> sure colinclark. np
2017-01-12T17:03:40 <colinclark> sorry about that!
2017-01-12T17:03:56 <alanharnum> colinclark: updating to your development branch of Flocking seems to have resolved the issue
2017-01-12T17:04:02 <colinclark> there you go :)

2017-01-12T17:04:36 <colinclark> woah
2017-01-12T17:04:43 <colinclark> alanharnum: is an ascii artist!
2017-01-12T17:05:23 <stegru> is that a thumb, or a finger?
2017-01-12T17:05:37 <alanharnum> a thumb
2017-01-12T17:05:45 <alanharnum> i think the \xe2\x96\x89 represent a sleeve
2017-01-12T17:07:58 <mrtyler> oh see i thought it was a bottle of liquor

2017-01-12T17:08:34 <alanharnum> the polymorphous interpretations possible of ASCII art are one of the sources of its power

2017-01-12T17:18:53 <gloob> should I bring up figlet weapon?
2017-01-12T17:20:28 <gloob> mrtyler: "my code works", where?
2017-01-12T17:20:46 <gloob> ok, enough bad jokes for today
2017-01-12T17:21:05 <mrtyler> gloob: we would also have accepted: "my code works" [citation needed]
2017-01-12T17:22:01 <stegru> there\'s a figlet npm package
2017-01-12T17:22:08 <gloob> oh no
2017-01-12T17:22:24 <stegru> can we think of an accessibility angle for it?
2017-01-12T17:22:38 <stegru> make text bigger in a console
2017-01-12T17:22:51 <gloob> so now you can fire a stream of characters using a non-blocking IO model
2017-01-12T17:23:11 <gloob> stegru: well, there\'s some relationship with DPI and magnification
2017-01-12T17:23:34 <stegru> wait, yes.. this is how i\'ll implement fontSize
2017-01-12T17:23:53 <stegru> for DOS users
2017-01-12T17:23:55 <gloob> for text canvas
2017-01-12T17:25:42 <gloob> I\'m thinking another approach, we can pipe all the desktop graphic representation through aalib and then apply the figlet filter for dpi scaling
2017-01-12T17:29:01 <mrtyler> accessibility angle for figlet: making text equally unreadable for those with good vision and thos with low vision
2017-01-12T17:29:34 <mrtyler> altho i think gloob could get a few million in funding for his startup based on aalib/figlet dpi scaling
2017-01-12T17:30:57 <gloob> using farms of gpu in the cloud
2017-01-12T17:31:09 <gloob> you can run it in a rpi if you want!
2017-01-12T17:34:11 <mrtyler> http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/walkingdead/images/3/3f/Shut-up-and-take-my-money.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20140829235648
2017-01-12T17:34:44 <gloob> Internet of Things, compatible
2017-01-12T17:35:54 <amatas> aalib can make accessible an image if you go enough far from the screen. A workmate used a NSFW desktop wallpaper with a very low DPI, you only notice what it was if you saw the screen from the other corner of the room.
2017-01-12T17:36:04 <gloob> mrtyler: by the way pretty good synthesis of the configuration formats and other stuff. Point 3 is one that needs decision I guess
2017-01-12T17:36:33 <mrtyler> amatas: that is amazing. a modern day Monet
2017-01-12T17:36:45 <mrtyler> gloob: thanks!
2017-01-12T17:36:54 <gloob> Dali and ascii art, the book
2017-01-12T17:36:56 <mrtyler> gloob: yeah part 3 is the only part that should be controversial right now, i guess
2017-01-12T17:37:32 <mrtyler> one reaeson i mentioned it is because the-t-in-rtf (i think) is supposedly getting close to wanting multiple windows vms
2017-01-12T17:37:40 <mrtyler> managed together
2017-01-12T17:37:54 <mrtyler> therefore, there will be some work in that PowerShell area
2017-01-12T17:38:12 <mrtyler> therefore, a good time to consider whether we want to do one-off PS work vs make ansible do it vs other alternatives
2017-01-12T17:38:31 <gloob> the problem is that, Powershell solution is use and throw outside of windows
2017-01-12T17:38:44 <stegru> i\'ve already at the point of multiple windows vms
2017-01-12T17:38:50 <mrtyler> right. no code reuse, no consistency in environemntal spin-up
2017-01-12T17:38:50 <gloob> we all are
2017-01-12T17:38:57 <gloob> we need windows7, 8 and 10
2017-01-12T17:39:01 <gloob> in the same repository
2017-01-12T17:39:12 <mrtyler> multiple windows vms simultaneously?
2017-01-12T17:39:12 <gloob> in parallel, running tests, burning your fingers!
2017-01-12T17:39:29 <mrtyler> i didn\'t talk about it in the email but i recommend caution here too
2017-01-12T17:39:36 <gloob> no simultaneously but using the same toolchain I guess
2017-01-12T17:40:03 <stegru> mine all run simultaneously if i\'m testing something
