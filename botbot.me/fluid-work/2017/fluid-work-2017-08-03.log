2017-08-03T16:34:32 <stegru> this is all your fault for trying code that hasn\'t gone through the review process!!
2017-08-03T16:39:08 <stegru> ok yes, so the code works, and the acceptance test works.. but the test only works because it\'s testing the actual behaviour, rather than the expected behaviour
2017-08-03T16:39:44 <stegru> so snapset_1a.json is good, and everything works as expected
2017-08-03T16:40:25 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - I\'ve added some feedback on your docs pull
2017-08-03T16:40:40 <Bosmon> Would you ahve time at some point to look at a little pull of mine https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/840 ?
2017-08-03T16:40:52 <Bosmon> THis is to resolve the "exploding log" problem that stegru ran into yesterday
2017-08-03T16:41:55 <stegru> and not the fire-crackers in cow pat kind
2017-08-03T16:42:18 <Bosmon> hahaha
2017-08-03T16:42:29 <Bosmon> What a horrifically misspent youth you must have had
2017-08-03T16:42:35 <Bosmon> We just put them in tree stumps :)
2017-08-03T16:43:19 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, and yes I can take a look at 840
2017-08-03T16:43:55 <Bosmon> simonjb - awesome, thanks!
2017-08-03T16:44:11 <simonjb> growing up in Northern Ireland, we weren\'t allowed to have fire-crackers :( in cow pats or otherwise
2017-08-03T16:45:00 <simonjb> plenty of cow pats though
2017-08-03T16:48:35 <jhernandez> stegru: actually, testing code is in fact part of the review process, isn\'t it? :P
2017-08-03T16:49:20 <stegru> why do you assume i was a youth when i did it?
2017-08-03T16:49:21 <stegru> ;)
2017-08-03T16:49:53 <jhernandez> I assume you\'ll fix it before I keep testing your unreviewed pr and discovering a new disaster :P
2017-08-03T16:50:29 <stegru> yes, doing it now
2017-08-03T16:51:14 <grrrero> Justin_o and everyone who\'s interested: should I write up the web icon font documentation in (Floe) User Interface Options (aka. Learner Options) wiki or somewhere else?
2017-08-03T16:52:43 <Justin_o> grrrero: hmm.. i guess you could make it a sibling of the https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Research+SVG+Icons
2017-08-03T16:53:18 <grrrero> Justin_o: Sounds good
2017-08-03T16:53:31 <Justin_o> although i\'m thinking this will end up being more general than something specific to UIO, so i\'m also open to it being more top level, and moving the SVG icon page along with it
2017-08-03T16:53:42 <Justin_o> jhung_away, michelled: any thoughts?
2017-08-03T16:53:57 <Justin_o> grrrero: at any rate, i think start it just as a sibling and we can move it later if need be
2017-08-03T16:56:41 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m catching up....
2017-08-03T16:57:21 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah, make it sibling for now and move it later if needed.
2017-08-03T16:57:53 <Justin_o> grrrero: ^
2017-08-03T16:57:54 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2017-08-03T16:58:08 <grrrero> Ok cool jhung, Justin_o

2017-08-03T17:09:03 <jhernandez> yes please
2017-08-03T17:12:50 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - thanks for the awesome work tracking down lost tests
2017-08-03T17:12:58 <Bosmon> Which test doesn\'t run, out of interest?

2017-08-03T17:15:27 <Bosmon> stegru - my friend Trevor would go to France to pick up "half dynos" as he called them
2017-08-03T17:15:30 <stegru> jhernandez: done.
2017-08-03T17:16:08 <Bosmon> stegru - when you say "get returns the wrong thing" - we\'re talking about the Windows DPI pull 110?
2017-08-03T17:16:18 <stegru> yes
2017-08-03T17:16:27 <Bosmon> What wrong thing does it return?
2017-08-03T17:16:37 <stegru> just something wrong
2017-08-03T17:16:41 <Bosmon> :)
2017-08-03T17:17:13 <stegru> instead of "aa.xx" it returns "aa"
2017-08-03T17:20:19 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-08-03T17:21:08 <Bosmon> What are aa and xx in this case?
2017-08-03T17:22:32 <Bosmon> Ah, curDpi.configured
2017-08-03T17:24:09 <Bosmon> Just FYI all your commits are registered as coming from git@grundell.co.uk which github doesn\'t recognise

2017-08-03T20:16:28 <michelled> Bosmon: it appears to have started when the repo was updated to the most recent universal

2017-08-03T20:39:06 <michelled> gtirloni: it\'s happening in the app
2017-08-03T20:39:10 <michelled> using this config: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs/gpii.preferencesServer.config.development.json
2017-08-03T20:39:40 <gtirloni> something seems to be processing it through html codes.. turning % into %25
2017-08-03T20:40:21 <michelled> I think I saw that Bosmon recently committed something related to that
2017-08-03T20:40:26 <michelled> I think I\'ll wait for him to be around
2017-08-03T20:41:01 <gtirloni> ok
2017-08-03T20:41:10 <gtirloni> i can confirm things still work as expected on Linux with that config file
2017-08-03T20:42:41 <Bosmon> michelled - what are all those %25 characters in the URL?
2017-08-03T20:49:39 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 now that I look closer - it looks that the %25 was introduced when I copy-pasted the error
2017-08-03T20:50:08 <michelled> the error message says "http://localhost/preferences/%userToken"

2017-08-03T14:45:31 <stegru> jhernandez: did you create GPII.170717.102542.msi? if so, I\'d love to have a copy (and the branch)
2017-08-03T14:46:15 <jhernandez> stegru: why?
2017-08-03T14:46:20 <stegru> why not??
2017-08-03T14:46:22 <jhernandez> xD
2017-08-03T14:46:27 <jhernandez> I asked first
2017-08-03T14:46:30 <stegru> ok ok
2017-08-03T14:46:32 <jhernandez> xDD
2017-08-03T14:46:40 <stegru> bern is wondering why the screen scaling isn\'t working
2017-08-03T14:46:43 <jhernandez> so, it\'s hst+nfc enhancements
2017-08-03T14:47:15 <stegru> it\'s from 17th june? does it have the updated listener, too?
2017-08-03T14:47:17 <jhernandez> it doesn\'t include the screen scaling
2017-08-03T14:47:28 <stegru> ok, best answer!
2017-08-03T14:47:55 <jhernandez> it doesn\'t include the changes you applied yesterday
2017-08-03T14:48:25 <stegru> ok that shouldn\'t matter
2017-08-03T14:49:16 <jhernandez> do you still need such installler?
2017-08-03T14:50:03 <stegru> yes, they\'re now saying githens\'s listener doesn\'t work
2017-08-03T14:50:26 <jhernandez> that doesn\'t make any sense
2017-08-03T14:50:29 <jhernandez> I\'ll share it with you
2017-08-03T14:51:40 <jhernandez> stegru: https://drive.google.com/a/raisingthefloor.org/file/d/0B8L4Eyw5NEA1dHNZU2IyVnoxNG8/view?usp=sharing
2017-08-03T14:52:00 <stegru> "is too large for Google to scan for viruses."
2017-08-03T14:52:03 <jhernandez> let me know if that link works for you
2017-08-03T14:52:03 <stegru> hmm :/
2017-08-03T14:52:05 <jhernandez> hahaha
2017-08-03T14:52:22 <jhernandez> I just included a keylogger
2017-08-03T14:52:39 <stegru> oh crap, i installed it using wine
2017-08-03T14:52:46 <jhernandez> hahaha
2017-08-03T14:53:15 <stegru> i didn\'t realise i had that installed
2017-08-03T14:53:40 <jhernandez> that == wine?
2017-08-03T14:53:57 <stegru> yes, i did something stupid like that before.. so i got rid of it
2017-08-03T14:54:29 <jhernandez> it\'s because you\'re using a linux distribution for windozers :P
2017-08-03T14:55:33 <jhernandez> this doesn\'t happen in distributions that got into a rpm dead end after a failing update
2017-08-03T14:55:35 <jhernandez> xDDD
2017-08-03T14:55:40 <stegru> haha
2017-08-03T14:56:02 <jhernandez> btw, I\'m back on my linux box
2017-08-03T14:56:06 <stegru> what can i say? i just don\'t like my clock at the top of the screen
2017-08-03T14:56:37 <jhernandez> the most annoying was getting vagrant up and running
2017-08-03T14:57:56 <jhernandez> so, apparently, I hit this problem, introduced recently in ubuntu too (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vagrant/+bug/1708125)
2017-08-03T14:58:54 <stegru> oh right
2017-08-03T14:59:06 <stegru> i\'m not using their packages
2017-08-03T14:59:18 <jhernandez> it is a combination of keeping old rvm stuff in your home folder in a recently installed os and a rubny\'s gemss mess up
2017-08-03T14:59:39 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-08-03T14:59:49 <jhernandez> now everything\'s working very good
2017-08-03T15:00:05 <stegru> ah right ok
2017-08-03T15:01:15 <stegru> my /usr/bin/vagrant just loads from /opt/vagrant..

2017-08-03T15:57:35 <Bosmon> To stegru and jhernandez I can heartily recommend my own practice of being on my same install of Windows 7 from 2009 which has never had any updates installed :)
2017-08-03T15:57:53 <Bosmon> "rpm dead ends" are a thing of the past when you choose to permanently inhabit the same dead end
2017-08-03T15:58:16 <stegru> exactly. if it\'s not broke.. don\'t fix it
2017-08-03T15:58:30 <Bosmon> Well it\'s broke in numerous ways
2017-08-03T15:58:38 <jhernandez> hahaha
2017-08-03T15:58:49 <Bosmon> Just none of which are comparable of the horror of how it might become broke if updated :)
2017-08-03T15:59:16 <Bosmon> I think I did restore it from a backup some time in 2013 when it managed to corrupt itself somehow
2017-08-03T16:00:24 <Bosmon> But there\'s something hugely reassuring about that panel which says:
2017-08-03T16:00:31 <Bosmon> Most recent check for updates: Never
2017-08-03T16:00:35 <Bosmon> Updates were installed: Never
2017-08-03T16:00:42 <stegru> haha
2017-08-03T16:00:46 <jhernandez> it\'s true, if it works, why updating it? :)
2017-08-03T16:02:05 <Bosmon> 14th July 2009
2017-08-03T16:02:07 <Bosmon> There it was
2017-08-03T16:02:09 <Bosmon> That glorious day :)
2017-08-03T16:03:11 <stegru> XP is still on my daughter\'s computer (dual boot).. she only uses it to play The Sims - why upgrade the OS just for that?
2017-08-03T16:03:17 <Bosmon> wow
2017-08-03T16:03:19 <Bosmon> Great
2017-08-03T16:03:24 <jhernandez> Bosmon: dude, you have to write down in the calendar and make a birthday party next year :)
2017-08-03T16:04:13 <Bosmon> Sadly I think this machine isn\'t going to get through another yet
2017-08-03T16:04:25 <Bosmon> Some time soon I\'m going to get the time to put together all those bits that I got at Toronto
2017-08-03T16:04:32 <Bosmon> For my new "Zen" system.....

2017-08-03T16:06:11 <jhernandez> JFYI, just built a gpii-app with most recent updates + hst + some prs and everything looks good
2017-08-03T16:06:27 <stegru> my previous computer was a "trigger\'s broom", it was probably 15 years old, but everything had been replaced... same computer, however ;)
2017-08-03T16:07:23 <jhernandez> this is, no duped infusion problems, tests passing, etc - now I\'ll test if relevant np sets are working as expected
2017-08-03T16:10:59 <jhernandez> stegru: wrt screen dpi scaling, which user do you use in order to test it?
2017-08-03T16:11:36 <jhernandez> oh, there\'s an os_win7 under acceptanceTests
2017-08-03T16:11:51 <stegru> "ste-test" ;)
2017-08-03T16:12:19 <stegru> one of the hst ones have it...
2017-08-03T16:12:58 <stegru> no
2017-08-03T16:14:06 <jhernandez> I just created a pull request with the snapsets I received from sgithens
2017-08-03T16:14:59 <jhernandez> and I think they aren\'t consistent with the format you\'re using on os_win7

2017-08-03T16:16:54 <stegru> ok
2017-08-03T16:18:25 <stegru> does the first one even work?
2017-08-03T16:19:54 <jhernandez> the snapset? I haven\'t tested it yet
2017-08-03T16:20:08 <jhernandez> and I assumed it won\'t work

2017-08-03T16:20:25 <stegru> oh, it\'s in your repo
2017-08-03T16:20:33 <jhernandez> right
2017-08-03T16:21:01 <stegru> i thought you put it in gpii :)
2017-08-03T16:23:13 <stegru> oh.. the \'set\' returns something different to the \'get\'
2017-08-03T16:23:26 <Bosmon> Sounds devastating to me
2017-08-03T16:23:29 <Bosmon> Why does it do that? : P

2017-08-03T16:23:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I added you some feedback on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/838
2017-08-03T16:23:56 <stegru> i\'m trying to think back
2017-08-03T16:24:05 <Bosmon> Although I\'m wondering whether we should just start the deprecation cycle now
2017-08-03T16:24:17 <Bosmon> Since naming the property "defaultInput", although it is consistent, seems rather obviously silly
2017-08-03T16:25:52 <jhernandez> stegru: so, although the payload is different, apparently, they (the snapsets) seem to work - why is that?
2017-08-03T16:27:39 <stegru> the acceptance test one isn\'t right
2017-08-03T16:28:31 <stegru> well, it is.. but it shouldn\'t be
2017-08-03T16:28:35 <jhernandez> aha
2017-08-03T16:29:20 <stegru> it\'s what\'s returned from the \'get\'.. but \'get\' returns the wrong thing
2017-08-03T16:29:58 <jhernandez> okay
