b'2017-08-02T14:10:03 <stegru> why are we still coding in v4, anyway? or at least, the linter seems to want me to
2017-08-02T14:10:37 <Bosmon> I don\'t know, how does it make you?
2017-08-02T14:10:44 <Bosmon> We should be in the node 6.x LTS
2017-08-02T14:11:10 <Bosmon> Although that doesn\'t necessarily mean we allow all the crazy language features it supports
2017-08-02T14:11:15 <stegru> oh yes, my node is 6
2017-08-02T14:11:18 <stegru> yes
2017-08-02T14:12:30 <Bosmon> Looks like one "Timothy Gu" assigned the issue to himself 3 weeks ago
2017-08-02T14:14:20 <Bosmon> Ah, lots of activity on this pull
2017-08-02T14:14:21 <Bosmon> https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/14231
2017-08-02T14:20:03 <Bosmon> Ok.... sadly node 7.10.1 didn\'t work either
2017-08-02T14:22:18 <stegru> what GUI are you using?

2017-08-02T14:54:38 <Bosmon> Well
2017-08-02T14:54:42 <Bosmon> I simply can\'t debug anything
2017-08-02T14:54:51 <Bosmon> I\'ve tried 2 versions of node-inspector, and tried patching one of them
2017-08-02T15:04:28 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-08-02T15:12:08 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-08-02T15:12:17 <Bosmon> I have managed to get node-inspector working by downgrading to node 6.3.1
2017-08-02T15:14:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i did some inspecting using VS Code on GPII Universal. I used node v6.9.4 and --inspect
2017-08-02T15:17:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - see my report above
2017-08-02T15:17:28 <Bosmon> You would have been able to inspect into universal, but not into its loaded version of Infusion
2017-08-02T15:18:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. i probably didn\'t debug that far down

2017-08-02T15:34:35 <Bosmon> stegru - ok, I think I\'ve found the problem with your GPII-2333 pull test failures :)
2017-08-02T15:34:39 <Bosmon> It\'s a little hilarious
2017-08-02T15:35:15 <Bosmon> Inside your writeLog function, you issue "fluid.logObjectRenderChars = 0xffffff;"
2017-08-02T15:35:18 <Bosmon> Which is possibly a little unwise
2017-08-02T15:35:39 <Bosmon> Or at least, it is unwise to set it without unsetting it : P
2017-08-02T15:35:54 <Bosmon> What then happens is that there is an expected test failure in the JournalIntegrationTests
2017-08-02T15:35:58 <stegru> oh!
2017-08-02T15:36:00 <Bosmon> Which then tries to dump a log of its activity to the console
2017-08-02T15:36:09 <stegru> actually, that was a temporary setting
2017-08-02T15:36:29 <Bosmon> So fluid.prettyPrintJSON has had a fair amount of work on it, but it\'s still not perfect
2017-08-02T15:36:43 <Bosmon> One interesting thing it does is impose its char limit in a kind of "streaming" way
2017-08-02T15:36:52 <Bosmon> So if it hits the char cap, it simply bails out of its recusion
2017-08-02T15:37:05 <stegru> ah got it
2017-08-02T15:37:27 <Bosmon> it turns out that VERY VERY DEEP inside the object tree descended from the component, there is an object of type IncomingMessage from node\'s API
2017-08-02T15:37:39 <Bosmon> Which turns out to have a bummed synthetic property named "encoding"
2017-08-02T15:37:45 <Bosmon> Which explodes the moment you try to access it
2017-08-02T15:38:35 <stegru> ok i see
2017-08-02T15:38:40 <Bosmon> So, really, there is actually an Infusion bug
2017-08-02T15:38:45 <stegru> yeh, like i said ;)
2017-08-02T15:38:54 <Bosmon> Well, sure
2017-08-02T15:39:06 <stegru> it just took my crappy code to uncover it
2017-08-02T15:39:06 <Bosmon> But nonetheless you contribute to the problem with a fault of your own : P
2017-08-02T15:39:48 <Bosmon> The problem is in this use of fluid.keys
2017-08-02T15:39:49 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidDebugging.js#L228
2017-08-02T15:40:00 <Bosmon> Which was a first attempt to deal with exactly this kind of problem
2017-08-02T15:40:24 <Bosmon> YOu see there is this blasted fluid.getSafeProperty utility
2017-08-02T15:40:35 <Bosmon> But it seems that there are some properties which are too bummed even for this
2017-08-02T15:41:07 <stegru> in a perfect world, you shouldn\'t need that wrapper
2017-08-02T15:41:55 <Bosmon> fluid.keys is buggered because it always tries to READ any key it finds
2017-08-02T15:41:59 <stegru> so.. i guess there\'s a "encoding" property that\'s been overridden by a getter

2017-08-02T11:39:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> Hi, all.  I\'m still getting frequent networking errors from within Vagrant VMs, so much so that I can only provision a box after many many passes.
2017-08-02T11:39:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> Obviously my networking in general is fine.
2017-08-02T11:40:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyone having problems with OS X and/or particular versions of virtualbox?
2017-08-02T11:40:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> The latest failure for a linux VM (infusion) was along the lines of "Couldn\'t resolve host name for https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_6.x/fc/24/x86_64/nodesource-release-fc24-1.noarch.rpm"
2017-08-02T11:41:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> I get similarly low-level failures trying to provision a windows VM: "[NuGet] An error occurred while loading packages from \'https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/\': Unable to connect to the remote server
2017-08-02T11:41:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> python2 not installed. The package was not found with the source(s) listed.
2017-08-02T11:41:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> "
2017-08-02T11:43:23 <the-t-in-rtf1> I\'m wondering about this: https://serverfault.com/questions/453185/vagrant-virtualbox-dns-10-0-2-3-not-working
2017-08-02T11:46:29 <the-t-in-rtf1> I don\'t have any problems with the linux repo, which is using the newer fedora 26 image.
2017-08-02T11:48:47 <gtirloni> that\'s interesting (f24 vs f26). is it intermittent?
2017-08-02T11:50:07 <gtirloni> i remember vbox\'s nat daemon was a bit unstable in the 5.0 branch but i don\'t remember when it got better (usually restarting it would "fix")
2017-08-02T11:53:03 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-08-02T11:54:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> Trying a second pass of f26 to see
2017-08-02T11:55:04 <the-t-in-rtf1> I haven\'t been able to get a windows VM to provision in something like a dozen straight attempts
2017-08-02T11:55:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> huh, maybe it is a timing thing, the f24 one I had running in the background succeeded
2017-08-02T11:56:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, define "it" in "restarting it", @gtirloni
2017-08-02T11:56:25 <the-t-in-rtf1> You mean the nat daemon?
2017-08-02T11:57:13 <gtirloni> yeah, i don\'t know what it\'s called in OSX but VBox on Windows had a vboxnatd process that kept crashing a while ago
2017-08-02T11:57:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> What\'s the latest version of vbox that the team recommends?
2017-08-02T11:57:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have 5.1.14, I know I haven\'t upgraded in a while.
2017-08-02T11:58:00 <gtirloni> vbox 5.1.26 and vagrant 1.9.7 seem to be working fine

2017-08-02T12:47:32 <stegru> jhernandez: when you have a moment, I would like you to test the updated proximity listener before i dish it out
2017-08-02T12:48:00 <jhernandez> stegru: in fact I\'ve already tested it
2017-08-02T12:48:06 <jhernandez> :)
2017-08-02T12:48:13 <jhernandez> it works nice
2017-08-02T12:48:30 <stegru> the thing I only compiled 5 minutes ago?
2017-08-02T12:48:39 <jhernandez> oh
2017-08-02T12:48:46 <jhernandez> no
2017-08-02T12:48:47 <stegru> i mean, the vaio listener
2017-08-02T12:48:52 <jhernandez> oh
2017-08-02T12:48:54 <jhernandez> okay
2017-08-02T12:49:01 <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/gpii-proximity-listener
2017-08-02T12:49:27 <stegru> it\'s the thing that githens did
2017-08-02T12:49:31 <jhernandez> I see
2017-08-02T12:49:52 <jhernandez> and, what\'s the plan?
2017-08-02T12:50:20 <jhernandez> I mean, I assume it only works with the VAIO built-in reader
2017-08-02T12:50:39 <stegru> well, give it to maureen so they don\'t need the external reader
2017-08-02T12:50:56 <jhernandez> okay
2017-08-02T12:51:19 <jhernandez> right
2017-08-02T12:51:50 <jhernandez> they said that they were going to set up the vaios before sending to the AJCs
2017-08-02T12:51:59 <jhernandez> for the pre-pilots
2017-08-02T12:52:19 <jhernandez> okay, I\'ll give it a test later
2017-08-02T12:52:52 <jhernandez> I\'m somehow fixing my laptop - which at this moment is a BRICK
2017-08-02T12:53:00 <stegru> not desperate or anything.. i\'d just rather someone else took a look before i caused a disaster
2017-08-02T12:53:03 <stegru> that\'s nice
2017-08-02T12:53:25 <stegru> maybe you should clean it
2017-08-02T12:53:44 <jhernandez> I had to set up my mac to keep working - my linux installation defeated when trying to run an upgrade :)
2017-08-02T12:54:22 <jhernandez> and I ended up with a half-working system
2017-08-02T12:54:27 <stegru> ah
2017-08-02T12:54:48 <stegru> which half was working? ;)
2017-08-02T12:55:15 <jhernandez> I tried to rollback to a previous snapshot but it didn\'t work
2017-08-02T12:55:25 <jhernandez> and zypper rejects to keep updating the system
2017-08-02T12:56:24 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone else, I am now consistently getting "cannot look up component type name fluid.textfieldSlider" errors when running the browser tests against infusion.
2017-08-02T12:56:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Is anyone aware of anything related?
2017-08-02T12:56:40 <jhernandez> so in fact I\'ve got a decent and working desktop environment, but there are things such as vbox that aren\'t working anymore
2017-08-02T12:57:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I am also getting variations on "fluid.modelPairToChanges is not a function"
2017-08-02T12:57:29 <stegru> just re-install the OS, that\'s why i have /home on another partition
2017-08-02T12:57:36 <jhernandez> looks like a rpm db thing - a dead end I\'d say
2017-08-02T12:58:13 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - modelPairToChanges was a recent update
2017-08-02T12:58:24 <Bosmon> So I imagine you have a stale copy of some of the files
2017-08-02T12:58:48 <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, me too - but I tried to avoid re-installing the os
2017-08-02T12:59:12 <stegru> yeh me too, i never re-install
2017-08-02T12:59:30 <stegru> since i moved away from rpm ;)
2017-08-02T12:59:35 <stegru> (kidding)
2017-08-02T13:00:40 <stegru> anyway, testing that vaio listener isn\'t urgent at all, since they have a work around - just ticking off my action item
2017-08-02T13:01:27 <stegru> but i\'m glad the regular listener is working, it means this one should (it\'s the same fix)
2017-08-02T13:02:36 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, I assume that rerunning the build from the host and blowing away the VM should be adequate, or is there some other source of staleness?
2017-08-02T13:05:08 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - are you running the tests via gpii-testem?
2017-08-02T13:05:20 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s possible that it is somehow resolving infusion onto its own dependent version of infusion
2017-08-02T13:05:25 <Bosmon> Rather than the head one
2017-08-02T13:05:44 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s interesting, and yes, these are browser tests.
2017-08-02T13:05:54 <the-t-in-rtf> but that would be resolving infusion on the node side?
2017-08-02T13:06:14 <Bosmon> I have no idea, just speculating wildly
2017-08-02T13:06:26 <Bosmon> Thinking what other infusions might be in the filesystem
2017-08-02T13:06:32 <Bosmon> The tests run fine to me as bare browser tests

2017-08-02T13:07:06 <the-t-in-rtf> The instrumented copies of the code might be out of date, but there is a step that should clear that.
2017-08-02T13:07:35 <Bosmon> I\'m firing up my windows vagrant box to try testing in there, but they were fine there when I last pushed to trunk
2017-08-02T13:07:39 <Bosmon> Which test gives you the failure?
2017-08-02T13:07:42 <the-t-in-rtf> various.
2017-08-02T13:07:45 <the-t-in-rtf> dozens of them.
2017-08-02T13:07:56 <Bosmon> You are running the tests via "npm test"?
2017-08-02T13:08:20 <the-t-in-rtf> no, I was following up Cindy and Justin\'s questions about running "npm test:vagrantBrowser" from the host environment.
2017-08-02T13:08:46 <Bosmon> oh wow
2017-08-02T13:09:06 <the-t-in-rtf> The first failure is "not ok 82 Firefox 54.0 - Data Binding Tests: modelPairToChanges"
2017-08-02T13:09:24 <the-t-in-rtf> the next tests fails with the same error.
2017-08-02T13:09:25 <Bosmon> That\'s what you\'d get if you had resolved an up-to-date test against a stale infusion
2017-08-02T13:10:04 <Bosmon> But I can\'t yet account for how you might have done it
2017-08-02T13:10:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m pretty sure it\'s down to the instrumentation step
2017-08-02T13:10:23 <Bosmon> ok
2017-08-02T13:10:37 <the-t-in-rtf> if I blow away the contents of the instrumented directory, which should be recreated, I now get all kinds of failures to resolve jQuery
2017-08-02T13:10:53 <Bosmon> I heard gtirloni talking about that on the list
2017-08-02T13:11:05 <the-t-in-rtf> This one is clearly my fault, and I have what I need to investigate.
2017-08-02T13:13:44 <Bosmon> Oh right, we don\'t yet have testem tests in master : P
2017-08-02T13:13:47 <Bosmon> That is what this is all about
2017-08-02T13:14:41 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-08-02T13:15:05 <Bosmon> But I\'ve re-verified that all the browser tests run fine in themselves in the one vagrant box I can afford to keep around
2017-08-02T13:15:15 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey there - wrt stegru\'s windows/pull/122, I\'m happy with it after his last update - do you want to take a look before I merge it?

2017-08-02T14:01:42 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - awkward heads-up about node 8.x and debugging - https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7593
2017-08-02T14:02:07 <Bosmon> Because of this open bug it is not possible to debug into code which is loaded within a V8 context - which, unfortunately, includes all of Infusion\'s code
2017-08-02T14:02:23 <Bosmon> The recommended fix is to "downgrade to 7.10.1" !
2017-08-02T14:02:41 <colinclark> oh no
2017-08-02T14:03:00 <Bosmon> Also, the issue is nearly a year old
2017-08-02T14:03:31 <stegru> I used "--debug" instead of "--inspect" - isn\'t that supported by 8?
2017-08-02T14:05:09 <Bosmon> stegru - people who aren\'t superhuman need a GUI to debug with
2017-08-02T14:05:22 * avtar joined the channel
2017-08-02T14:05:51 <stegru> even I use a GUI
2017-08-02T14:06:00 <Bosmon> Which one?
2017-08-02T14:06:08 <stegru> the command line
2017-08-02T14:06:12 <stegru> heh no, WebStorm
2017-08-02T14:06:12 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2017-08-02T14:07:10 <Bosmon> Anyway, 7.10.1 looks like a good option for me....
2017-08-02T14:07:16 <Bosmon> let\'s hope this gets fixed before an 8.x becomes LTS
2017-08-02T14:07:50 <Bosmon> Which looks like..... in about two months .....
