2017-03-24T18:32:35 <colinclark> we\'re still contemplating some changes to it
2017-03-24T18:34:14 <colinclark> I will tell everyone when it\'s up again
2017-03-24T18:38:36 <colinclark> Bosmon: Wasn\'t there a HN thread that you recommended posting positions on too?
2017-03-24T18:39:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - the other way round
2017-03-24T18:39:58 <Bosmon> The thread I used was a "who wants to be hired" thread
2017-03-24T18:40:16 <Bosmon> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13764730
2017-03-24T18:40:19 <Bosmon> For this monthj
2017-03-24T18:44:25 <colinclark> A few Canadians, none from Toronto or even Ontario
2017-03-24T18:44:31 <colinclark> but it sounds like it\'s worth keeping an eye on this thread

2017-03-24T15:13:31 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - just a general note that npm announced "free organisations" today and I have created these two organisations for our node modules
2017-03-24T15:13:45 <Bosmon> If you have an account on npm and feel you\'ve been left out of these, please ping me

2017-03-24T15:30:26 <the-t-in-rtf> For anyone interested (Hi, @Bosmon, @cindyli, @simonjb), here is a preliminary code coverage report (node and browser) for GPII universal: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/universal-coverage-20170324/
2017-03-24T15:31:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I will open a PR in a bit, and rely on you three (and others) to comment on things (like the jQuery lib) that need to be excluded.
2017-03-24T15:35:07 <Bosmon> Thanks, the-t-in-rtf - this is great and really helpful
2017-03-24T15:35:35 <Bosmon> I\'m pretty confident that, for example, line 353 of http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/universal-coverage-20170324/universal/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js.html is actually tested, so there are probably still some test files which are yet to be picked up
2017-03-24T15:36:02 <Bosmon> In general an overall load count of 3x for this file is incredibly low, this file should be loaded dozens of times as the test cases run
2017-03-24T15:36:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.  It is provisional at the moment, I have to confirm that all code is instrumented and that every single test HTML file is correctly configured to transmit coverage results.
2017-03-24T15:36:25 <alanharnum> this is the comment on the docs PR I mentioned in IDRC standup: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/114#discussion_r107857678
2017-03-24T15:36:26 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - ah I see, this is just coverage for the browser-based tests?
2017-03-24T15:36:37 <Bosmon> I guess there\'s no way to fuse coverage reports of node-based and browser-based tests?
2017-03-24T15:42:07 <alanharnum> Bosmon, I\'d be curious on your perspective on this question as well that the-t-in-rtf raised in the documentation PR: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/114#discussion_r107857678
2017-03-24T15:42:27 <alanharnum> to me, it doesn\'t have an obvious answer & I\'m still thinking about it myself
2017-03-24T15:43:33 <alanharnum> oh, I see you did comment
2017-03-24T15:43:39 <alanharnum> which i didn\'t see for some reason :

2017-03-24T15:50:22 <jhung> simonjb: your stand-up update reminded me of the work that was done at the CSUN hackathon. One of the groups created an UtteranceQueue which aims to make the queuing and listening to events with a screen reader less overwhelming.
2017-03-24T15:50:36 <jhung> simonjb: See Group 4 in this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vcWdGC7Wcp4m20497GJVN_d0maXwptz0h8UStxjfwko/edit#heading=h.nff6wqv5kobo
2017-03-24T15:55:09 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, it should be coverage for both, I will confirm that.
2017-03-24T16:00:01 <simonjb> thanks jhung
2017-03-24T16:00:40 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - here\'s the wiki reference I was mentioning: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Plan+to+Abolish+Invokers+and+Events#PlantoAbolishInvokersandEvents-TransformingPromiseChains
2017-03-24T16:00:47 <jhung> np simonjb
2017-03-24T16:01:40 <the-t-in-rtf> There is absolutely a way to fuse them and my code should have done so.
2017-03-24T16:01:51 <the-t-in-rtf> This was literally the first borderline complete run.
2017-03-24T16:01:59 <the-t-in-rtf> them = browser and node coverage reports

2017-03-24T16:13:49 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - so we can observe that this algorithm already exists: https://github.com/cujojs/when/blob/master/docs/api.md#promisetimeout
2017-03-24T16:14:12 <Bosmon> So our own treatment of the terrain should reflect a similar kind of factoring, even if we plan to factor it differently in the end
2017-03-24T16:14:26 <Bosmon> Sorry, I meant "even if we plan to package it differently in the end"

2017-03-24T17:43:40 <alanharnum> Bosmon or another, can someone confirm quickly for me whether or not it\'s still necessary for a fluid.viewComponent to be the rightmost grade to avoid potential merging bugs?
2017-03-24T17:43:57 <alanharnum> I looked around in the JIRAs but was unable to find a related issue

2017-03-24T18:01:27 <the-t-in-rtf> @alanharnum, what happens if you try moving fluid.viewComponent to the left side in your documentation example.
2017-03-24T18:01:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, you have a live sandbox and all\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2017-03-24T18:01:37 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: haha
2017-03-24T18:01:43 <alanharnum> point :p
2017-03-24T18:02:47 <the-t-in-rtf> it bombs.
2017-03-24T18:03:02 <the-t-in-rtf> fluid.initDomBinder called for component with typeName fluid.helloWorld without an initialised container - this has probably resulted from placing "fluid.viewComponent" in incorrect position in grade merging order.  Make sure to place it to the right of any non-view grades in the gradeNames list to ensure that it overrides properly\\\\
2017-03-24T18:04:20 <alanharnum> here we see, yet again, the advantage of Aristotelian experimentation over the resort to Platonic rationalism
2017-03-24T18:04:40 <alanharnum> that is to say, i should have just tried this myself instead of digging in JIRAs and asking people :p
2017-03-24T18:04:43 <mrtyler> css elements are but shadows on the cave wall
2017-03-24T18:05:00 <alanharnum> i had thought it only occurred under certain circumstances for some reason
2017-03-24T18:05:53 <the-t-in-rtf> what\'s funny is that the grade I mixed in was just fluid.component with no options.
2017-03-24T18:07:00 <the-t-in-rtf> If you mix fluid.component to the right of fliud.viewComponent, I\'m assuming there are no problems because fluid.viewComponent already extends fluid.component.
2017-03-24T18:07:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Where even a "marker" grade will result in the error.
2017-03-24T18:11:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Must be more complex than that.
2017-03-24T18:11:56 <the-t-in-rtf> fluid.modelComponent by itself will also trigger the error, even though fluid.viewComponent directly extends that.

2017-03-24T18:23:04 <colinclark> Hey fluid-everyone, does anyone have suggestions for sites that we should post a developer position we\'re hiring for here at the IDRC? We have to hire within Ontario, so I\'m looking for job sites that will have a lot of visibility in the province. We\'ll also try to post as widely as possible within our network, so suggestions there are helpful as well.
2017-03-24T18:23:49 <lliskovoi> colinclark: http://charityvillage.com/ is great!
2017-03-24T18:24:09 <colinclark> I think OCADU already posts there for us, yes!
2017-03-24T18:24:49 <lliskovoi> colinclark: I would also post in a link to it in Bunz employment zone
2017-03-24T18:24:55 <colinclark> When I search for "software developer" I get one job posting there, for a nurse practitioner :)
2017-03-24T18:25:14 <lliskovoi> yeah, their search function is not great
2017-03-24T18:25:22 <colinclark> oh yes
2017-03-24T18:25:27 <colinclark> this is that mysterious facebook thingy
2017-03-24T18:25:49 <lliskovoi> I\'m a member, I can add you to the group or post about it, whichever you prefer
2017-03-24T18:25:50 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - any grade directly dervied from fluid.component will cause the problem
2017-03-24T18:25:53 <Bosmon> Including fluid.component
2017-03-24T18:26:11 <colinclark> cool, lliskovoi! when iris reposts the position, can you post it there for us?
2017-03-24T18:26:21 <lliskovoi> sure!
2017-03-24T18:26:29 <colinclark> awesome
2017-03-24T18:26:48 <Bosmon> I\'ll try to resolve this silliness in the current framework rewrite
2017-03-24T18:27:02 <alanharnum> colinclark: I don\'t know if OCAD posts to http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home-eng.do?lang=eng, but that\'s the big one that I\'m aware of
2017-03-24T18:27:09 <alanharnum> (in terms of government aggregator sites)
2017-03-24T18:27:27 <colinclark> I think that\'s how I first got my job working for Jutta, in 1997 :)
2017-03-24T18:27:28 <alanharnum> There\'s also LinkedIn, but suspect OCADU posts there already
2017-03-24T18:27:31 <colinclark> on the job bank site
2017-03-24T18:27:32 <alanharnum> haha
2017-03-24T18:27:37 <simonjb> colinclark: http://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&l=Ontario%2C+Canada&d=20&u=Km
2017-03-24T18:28:16 <simonjb> oh weird
2017-03-24T18:28:17 <alanharnum> colinclark: Ladies Learning Code also runs a job board that has pretty good Toronto reach: http://jobs.ladieslearningcode.com/
2017-03-24T18:28:26 <colinclark> that would be excellent, simonjb
2017-03-24T18:28:34 <colinclark> or sorry, alanharnum :)
2017-03-24T18:28:56 <colinclark> simonjb: Stack Overflow seems to only list $2500 USD/year to post jobs
2017-03-24T18:28:59 <colinclark> which is mindblowing
2017-03-24T18:29:25 <simonjb> when I click the stackoverflow link I only see one job but when I made the query I see lots
2017-03-24T18:29:44 <simonjb> good suggestion alanharnum
2017-03-24T18:30:30 <colinclark> any other similar sites that you can think of, alanharnum?
2017-03-24T18:30:52 <alanharnum> not off the top of my head
2017-03-24T18:30:54 <colinclark> ok
2017-03-24T18:31:22 <colinclark> well, OCAD HR will definitely pay to post on the Ladies Learning Code site, so that\'s great
2017-03-24T18:31:24 <alanharnum> I do know a lot of Ontario-based techie library people check https://ischool.utoronto.ca/job-site/
2017-03-24T18:31:34 <alanharnum> since you\'ve semi-successfully hired one of those ;)
2017-03-24T18:31:38 <lliskovoi> colinclark: I think CSI has a job board as well
2017-03-24T18:31:50 <colinclark> oh cool
2017-03-24T18:32:21 <alanharnum> colinclark: when is the posting going up on the OCAD site for external advocates, so I can boost through my networks?
