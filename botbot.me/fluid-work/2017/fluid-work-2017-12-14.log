2017-12-14T16:37:37 <Bosmon> Sorry I had to shift the meeting a bit but I have a crowded evening .....
2017-12-14T16:38:46 <gloob> Bosmon: I had a personal time collision today, I will catch up with JJ
2017-12-14T16:38:57 <Bosmon> gloob - sure, no worries
2017-12-14T16:47:01 <colinclark> simonjb: I talked with Claire at Bridges yesterday for a bit\xe2\x80\x94they're bringing me out in the new year to talk about co-design and our projects
2017-12-14T16:47:18 <colinclark> I also talked with Jutta and she seemed to think we should go for the funding that Suzie mentioned
2017-12-14T16:47:31 <colinclark> so I'll need to follow up with her but we can chat more about next steps
2017-12-14T16:49:28 <simonjb> ok, great, thanks colinclark
2017-12-14T16:52:53 <simonjb> Bosmon: cindyli was just catching me up on your discussions regarding  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/558 and recording the state of universal before merge using a JIRA
2017-12-14T16:53:40 <simonjb> Bosmon: are you okay with me going ahead with this and the merge?

2017-12-14T19:11:31 <mrtyler> thx ussjoin. i haven't looked at vault/kubernetes integration at all so this looks interesting
2017-12-14T19:12:00 <ussjoin> mrtyler: Virtual Kubelet doesn't look (to me?) like a Vault thing, just something that I came across in my feed.
2017-12-14T19:12:26 <mrtyler> ussjoin: fyi it looks like you are an Owner of github gpii-ops org, so you should be able to move your repo there or whatever
2017-12-14T19:12:56 <mrtyler> ussjoin: ah sorry, i thought this was related to your comment during the demo about vault/k8s integration solutions

2017-12-14T19:17:58 <ussjoin> mrtyler: OK. For some reason I didn't have the permissions before, but I'll look again. Regardless, per colinclark's request, I'll create the new repo and then make a PR.

2017-12-14T19:59:43 <ussjoin> mrtyler amatas: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes.html has documentation on the Kubernetes backend in Vault. That's a relatively new part of Vault (version 0.8.3), but the advantage is not needing a separate interface (versus one of the other integrations).

2017-12-14T11:31:30 <stegru> javjarfer[m], gloob, i\'ve written a utility that accesses the windows settings: https://github.com/stegru/windows-settings
2017-12-14T11:31:48 <gloob> Wowooo
2017-12-14T11:31:53 <gloob> Bravo
2017-12-14T11:32:09 <stegru> you can now set the blue-light setting via command-line ;)
2017-12-14T11:32:09 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: so soon, and another gift
2017-12-14T11:34:42 <stegru> gloob: I\'ve been told something like "the settings api" was a priority for me - you where the person who knows what it means. Is this what they where talking about?
2017-12-14T11:34:59 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: what was that thing you asked me to review?
2017-12-14T11:35:07 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: that is simply great ... I need to take a look to that in order to start thinking the setting handler that should call that utility
2017-12-14T11:36:05 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: a couple of min and I will paste you the links
2017-12-14T11:36:10 <stegru> ok
2017-12-14T11:41:40 <amatas> stegru: awesome script, I didn\'t know that sqlite is able to import/export csv data
2017-12-14T11:44:15 <stegru> amatas: me neither.. it\'s the first time I did something like that
2017-12-14T11:45:46 <stegru> i\'m amazed how fast it is
2017-12-14T11:46:08 <stegru> (<1 sec for me)
2017-12-14T11:52:33 <amatas> yup, amazing
2017-12-14T11:55:13 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon2 and others, I am continuing to look at the test (or possibly test reporting) instability with the infusion pull.
2017-12-14T11:55:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Basically successful runs don\'t always have the same number of test results, they can be off by hundreds.
2017-12-14T11:55:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m trying to figure out what tests are not being run and/or reported on.
2017-12-14T11:56:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, in doing this I figured out a very useful option that hides non-error log output from the final report.tap file.
2017-12-14T11:56:25 <the-t-in-rtf> For Infusion in particular it becomes much easier to read the output.
2017-12-14T11:56:51 <the-t-in-rtf> This kind of stuff:

2017-12-14T11:57:08 <the-t-in-rtf> it goes on for ages in multiple tests.
2017-12-14T11:58:07 <the-t-in-rtf> My hope is that with clean output and a few other bits I can figure out what\'s missing in one or more seemingly partial runs, more as I figure that out.
2017-12-14T11:58:58 <the-t-in-rtf> The option is tap_quiet_logs: https://github.com/testem/testem/blob/master/docs/config_file.md#config-level-options

2017-12-14T12:14:25 <gloob> stegru: no, the settings api is a request from Gregg about to generate some kind of "universal" API for exposing settings by third-party, as far as I know Bosmon2 is currently working on that
2017-12-14T12:14:36 <gloob> if not we have many APIs surrounding us
2017-12-14T12:15:22 <stegru> ok gloob, good
2017-12-14T12:15:32 <gloob> stegru: the window client is amazing, we can use it as a reference, thanks
2017-12-14T12:15:42 <gloob> although I didn\'t test it yet :D

2017-12-14T16:12:42 <simonjb> I like the less formal style of Fowler\'s Patterns of Application Architecture much more than the GoF pattern style and I think it\'s a better fit here

2017-12-14T16:16:56 <simonjb> I was thinking of that also
2017-12-14T16:17:06 <colinclark> at least in the sense of having them emphasize strategies that most support "authorship"
2017-12-14T16:17:16 <colinclark> but perhaps, in the long run, more globally in the sense that I think danayo was exploring the other day
2017-12-14T16:17:38 <colinclark> what were you thinking, simonjb?

2017-12-14T16:21:38 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'m still thinking this through, but something I was thinking of is in a way Alexander\'s patterns feel more generative to me than software patterns often do -- start from a context and here are options for building in that context
2017-12-14T16:21:56 <colinclark> ahhh
2017-12-14T16:21:59 <colinclark> that\'s really really interesting
2017-12-14T16:25:17 <simonjb> software patterns often do have a contextual, generative feel, but they also have a communication role -- here\'s what the creator of this code was thinking and why they built it this way
2017-12-14T16:25:28 <simonjb> but I\'m still thinking this through
2017-12-14T16:26:51 <danayo> colinclark, simonjb: this alexander?

2017-12-14T16:27:24 <michelled> danayo:  this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander
2017-12-14T16:27:34 <simonjb> danayo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language
2017-12-14T16:28:47 <danayo> ah right simonjb, of course, I even read a bit of that! :)
2017-12-14T16:29:19 <simonjb> I decided to go with the Fowler style initially as I found it effective in his P of EAA book but I\'m doing so with an open mind
2017-12-14T16:29:48 <simonjb> this article of Fowler\'s is a nice discussion of his approach to writing patterns: https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/writingPatterns.html
