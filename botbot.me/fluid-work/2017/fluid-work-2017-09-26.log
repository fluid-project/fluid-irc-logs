b'2017-09-26T15:49:54 <kasparnet> and continue the whining
2017-09-26T15:50:00 <Bosmon> kasparnet - looks like we have some wacky defaulting behaviour in multiInput
2017-09-26T15:50:09 <Bosmon> WHich defaults "undefined" to "null"
2017-09-26T15:50:13 * kasparnet has quit
2017-09-26T15:50:14 <Bosmon> Which I imagine will then output "undefined"
2017-09-26T15:54:38 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: https://docs.fluidproject.org has been migrated to the IDRC infrastructure and is now behind HTTPS with a proper TLS certificate. If you find any issues, please let me know.
2017-09-26T15:55:53 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: I need someone with admin access to infusion-docs repo to add a webhook there (Jenkins GitHub plugin -- "https://ci.inclusivedesign.ca/github-webhook/")
2017-09-26T15:57:36 <stegru> it works
2017-09-26T15:57:52 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i should be able to help with that
2017-09-26T15:58:02 <gtirloni> thanks!
2017-09-26T15:58:06 <gtirloni> stegru: thx!
2017-09-26T15:59:00 <stegru> don\'t you think Let\'s Encrypt is the best thing ever?
2017-09-26T15:59:25 <stegru> just for the automation
2017-09-26T16:00:14 <Justin_o> gtirloni: so there is already a jenkins web hook there that points at a fluidproject.org url
2017-09-26T16:00:29 <Justin_o> has that one been changed now, it is also https
2017-09-26T16:00:31 <Justin_o> ?
2017-09-26T16:01:14 <gtirloni> it was probably not working because there was no CI configuration for docs.fluid and it was pointing to GitHub Pages. Maybe it was added by default but never actually used?
2017-09-26T16:01:22 <gtirloni> yes, it should point to the inclusivedesign one now
2017-09-26T16:01:52 * jessm joined the channel
2017-09-26T16:01:52 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay, it has been updated
2017-09-26T16:01:56 <gtirloni> thank you!
2017-09-26T16:02:02 <Justin_o> np
2017-09-26T16:02:26 <Justin_o> gtirloni: so for docs we won\'t have to manually deploy anymore?
2017-09-26T16:02:51 <gtirloni> well, just push to the gh-pages branch as before and jenkins will pick it up
2017-09-26T16:03:16 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah okay, but it isn\'t actually hosted on github pages?
2017-09-26T16:03:36 <gtirloni> yep, exactly. for now nothing changed, it\'s the same deployment workflow... except it\'s hosted with us now
2017-09-26T16:03:55 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay thanks
2017-09-26T16:03:58 <gtirloni> yw

2017-09-26T17:33:38 <michelled> so the issue with the footer was because the container positioning was defaulting to \'static\' and didn\'t respect the \'absolute\' on the footer
2017-09-26T17:46:10 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i filed a PR to update the URL for the exploration tool on the build site. I also updated the links to https where possible. https://github.com/fluid-project/build.fluidproject.org/pull/22
2017-09-26T17:47:07 <gtirloni> that might impact local testing, i don\'t know how development for this website is being done at the moment
2017-09-26T17:47:18 <gtirloni> ah no, locally you don\'t set it to https://, right?
2017-09-26T17:48:05 <gtirloni> re: the explorationTool location.. I guess it was copied manually at some point to a /explorationTool directly.. could the link point to the actual location? https://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/

2017-09-26T20:50:49 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Is there a general consensus here on habitually resetting box-sizing to border-box (and applying it to all elements) ?
2017-09-26T20:51:50 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-26T20:54:18 <gmoss> grrrero: I\'m not sure what the consensus is, but my first stop would be to check out what stylesheets like Normalize or Reset are doing
2017-09-26T20:55:10 <grrrero> gmoss: Nice tip! Looking now
2017-09-26T20:55:41 <gmoss> i.e. if they\'re doing "* { box-sizing: border-box; }" then I should think it\'s a pretty reasonable thing to do, but yeah check it out and hopefully that gives you a good answer!
2017-09-26T20:59:09 <grrrero> gmoss: I don\'t see it in theirs; even MDN is like "Some experts recommend that web developers should consider routinely applying box-sizing: border-box to all elements."
2017-09-26T21:02:47 <gmoss> grrrero: hmm, seems like it\'s more of a judgement call thing, in that case. I think it\'s super convenient since removes the need to constantly readjust heights and widths when the border and padding are changed. I would say that if you\'re going to apply it to all elements that the challenge will be to remember that you\'ve done it, if you run into any unexpected behaviour :)
2017-09-26T21:03:56 <gmoss> if you\'re starting a new site from scratch, that\'s much easier to handle. if you\'re going to be adding it to something with a bit of history, it\'d be good to make sure it doesn\'t give you any trouble
2017-09-26T21:04:05 <grrrero> gmoss: Right

2017-09-26T14:01:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding this review comment - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/519#pullrequestreview-65207937, do you mean this path is still too deep? if so, do you have suggestions?
2017-09-26T14:01:55 <cindyli> to specify the "dataStore" subcomponent under "userService"
2017-09-26T14:02:08 <cindyli> i know we cannot do {that > userService > dataStore}
2017-09-26T14:02:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - in general we should avoid the use of the ">" selector
2017-09-26T14:02:25 <cindyli> and cannot do {that dataStore} neither
2017-09-26T14:02:34 <cindyli> ah, ok
2017-09-26T14:02:48 <Bosmon> The whole point of the IoCSS syntax is to abstract over the exact tree structure
2017-09-26T14:02:50 <cindyli> so, can i just remove ">"?
2017-09-26T14:02:58 <Bosmon> So to write ">" in practice is no better than to write "options.components.x"
2017-09-26T14:03:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think the use of " " plus an exact grade name is probably a better approach
2017-09-26T14:03:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: should i convert "{that > userService}" to "{that userService}"
2017-09-26T14:04:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - plus a better name for userService, yes
2017-09-26T14:04:19 <cindyli> a better name meaning "gpii.oauth2.userService"?
2017-09-26T14:04:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - right
2017-09-26T14:04:27 <cindyli> ok. thanks

2017-09-26T14:46:53 <kasparnet> I ran into a bit of an issue that I\'m not sure how to go about
2017-09-26T14:46:58 <Bosmon> kasparnet - NIETT!
2017-09-26T14:47:06 <kasparnet> BOSSS MAN
2017-09-26T14:47:09 <Bosmon> You can\'t avoid speaking to me, I am right here :)
2017-09-26T14:47:14 <kasparnet> haha
2017-09-26T14:48:37 <kasparnet> So I guess the problem is solvable in my example case, but:
2017-09-26T14:48:47 <kasparnet> if you look at the UIO solution entry: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L2778
2017-09-26T14:49:12 <kasparnet> the contrastTheme setting will always be set - and default to "default"
2017-09-26T14:49:49 <simonjb> cindyli: did you get a chance to look at the vagrant issue I was seeing? Do you think it\'s because Windows?
2017-09-26T14:50:04 <kasparnet> this also means that if I send an empty model (for example all the common terms in an application specific block)
2017-09-26T14:50:23 <kasparnet> my output will contain the "contrastTheme: default"
2017-09-26T14:50:58 <simonjb> cindyli: is that the right Vagrant file to use? https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2435/vagrant-configs/Vagrantfile
2017-09-26T14:51:03 <kasparnet> now, the trouble occurs when a user logs in with an NP set with the contrasttheme common term set at the (non-scoped) level of the prefs set
2017-09-26T14:51:14 * clown has quit
2017-09-26T14:51:16 <kasparnet> (ie. not scoped to an application)
2017-09-26T14:51:27 <cindyli> simonjb: i just merged in the master and addressed all Bosmon\'s comments. now running "vagrant up" in "vagrant-configs" folder. figured to use the latest code changes. the start hasn\'t finished yet but so far so good.
2017-09-26T14:51:40 <cindyli> yes, that\'s the vagrant file being used, simonjb
2017-09-26T14:51:45 <simonjb> great, thanks cindyli
2017-09-26T14:52:04 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-09-26T14:52:08 <kasparnet> my current code will do the model transformation on the "outer" (non-scoped) common terms - lets call these outerInferred
2017-09-26T14:52:30 <kasparnet> and then do a model transformation on the "inner" (scoped to the application) common terms - lets call these innerInferred
2017-09-26T14:52:36 * clown joined the channel
2017-09-26T14:53:16 <kasparnet> but as I just mentioned above the innerInferred settings will always contain "contrastTheme: default" if there is no model
2017-09-26T14:53:44 <Bosmon> Hey there gtirloni - I\'m seeing certificate problems on https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html - did we change something recently?
2017-09-26T14:53:47 <kasparnet> which will overwrite the actual contrastTHeme i want, which is set in the outerInferred
2017-09-26T14:54:24 <Bosmon> Wow, actually I can\'t access the docs site at all

2017-09-26T14:57:43 <gmoss> Bosmon, michelled: yes I did, same issue. It worked just fine in Firefox when accessing via HTTP rather than HTTPS, but it seems in Chrome that it "remembered" the site is using HSTS, which tells the browser not to accept the site in anything other than HTTPS from now on
2017-09-26T14:57:56 <gmoss> kasparnet ^
2017-09-26T14:58:29 <kasparnet> well, if it encourages people to use firefox over chrome, I say we keep it!

2017-09-26T15:04:16 <gtirloni> I\'ll be moving docs.fluidproject.org from GitHub Pages to our own infrastructure later today so that should solve the issue
2017-09-26T15:04:23 <Bosmon> gtirloni - fantastic :)
2017-09-26T15:04:33 <Bosmon> What will the workflow be for publishing to it after that?
2017-09-26T15:04:35 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel

2017-09-26T15:05:58 <gtirloni> I can keep the same workflow.. people just push to gh-pages branch and it gets deployed
2017-09-26T15:06:18 <Bosmon> Oh wow

2017-09-26T15:20:18 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I gotta run in 10 mins or so
2017-09-26T15:20:29 <kasparnet> but I\'ll ping you about the issue I described above tomorrow
2017-09-26T15:20:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet sorry, I see the issue now
2017-09-26T15:20:45 <kasparnet> I implemented the functionality we talked about but have some failing tests due to the issue
2017-09-26T15:21:02 <kasparnet> and ofc. I need to add some tests for the new functionality
2017-09-26T15:21:28 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-26T15:22:01 <Bosmon> I guess I\'m not completely clear why the behaviour isn\'t as expected
2017-09-26T15:22:32 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2017-09-26T15:22:39 <Bosmon> Just piecing together all the bits of comment
2017-09-26T15:23:32 <Bosmon> OK, well the behaviour when the user has the same preference both at an application scope and at global scope will not be of interest during the pilots
2017-09-26T15:24:26 <Bosmon> To be honest, this will most likely require special-casing in the matchmaker anyway
2017-09-26T15:24:58 <Bosmon> That is, by the time we get to the matchMakerOutput, the system must have committed itself to expressing a preference at just the application level, and have resolved these issues by itself
2017-09-26T15:25:05 <kasparnet> the issue is that this will happen if the user has a common term like the in the global scope
2017-09-26T15:25:36 <Bosmon> As I see it, this is starting to touch on the same kinds of issues we will think about in the "5-layer model"
2017-09-26T15:25:44 <kasparnet> damn, english kasper, english!
2017-09-26T15:25:46 <Bosmon> So it will be OK to leave those tests commented out with a TODO referencing that JIRA number for now
2017-09-26T15:25:56 <Bosmon> It\'s ok we understand your German just fine :)
2017-09-26T15:26:34 <kasparnet> I might get away with modifying the solution reigstry entries a bit as well
2017-09-26T15:26:41 <kasparnet> but I\'ll file a JIRA about it in any case
2017-09-26T15:29:07 <Bosmon> Cheers, KASPARDNIETT!

2017-09-26T15:34:54 <ussjoin> Hello, world.
2017-09-26T15:37:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hmm, come to think about it
2017-09-26T15:37:11 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - just a note that I see several unaddressed comments in #519 so we should hold off merging until tomorrow
2017-09-26T15:37:25 <kasparnet> the desired behavior for condition transform
2017-09-26T15:37:48 <kasparnet> where the "conditionPath" refers to something non-existing.. shouldn\'t that be to not evaluate as true nor false?
2017-09-26T15:38:05 <kasparnet> or do you think that the correct behavior is to consider that case a "false"?
2017-09-26T15:38:21 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I think that\'s general behaviour for all transforms yes (undefined input -> no output)
2017-09-26T15:38:24 <simonjb> will do Bosmon, I think Cindy is addressing at the moment
2017-09-26T15:38:28 <Bosmon> But specifically we seem to special-case "null"
2017-09-26T15:38:36 <Bosmon> Which surprised the Bulgarians
2017-09-26T15:39:30 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-26T15:39:39 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok, in that case, I think the issue is solvable by fixing transform.condition\'s behavior
2017-09-26T15:39:54 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well sure, it\'s solvable, but should it be? : P
2017-09-26T15:40:08 <Bosmon> I was wondering if you remembered why this special-case "null" branch was there
2017-09-26T15:40:10 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-09-26T15:40:21 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well, there is a bigger issue that should be taken care of long term
2017-09-26T15:40:35 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - I was seeing some unaddressed comments on #519
2017-09-26T15:40:50 <kasparnet> Bosmon: no, but I do remember us talking about the null branch
2017-09-26T15:41:17 <kasparnet> but not why
2017-09-26T15:41:18 <Bosmon> simonjb - thanks so much for the merge of #840!
2017-09-26T15:41:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet - do you remember what we said about it?
2017-09-26T15:41:34 <simonjb> you\'re welcome Bosmon
2017-09-26T15:41:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: you mean your comments, that\'s true, i haven\'t pushed up yet. was hoping to address the production vm issue before the push. doing it now so you can look at the code
2017-09-26T15:41:56 <kasparnet> I *think* it had something to do with the fact that you cannot express undefined in JSON, and we wanted to be able to express something undefined\'ish
2017-09-26T15:42:25 * jessm joined the channel
2017-09-26T15:42:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: pushed
2017-09-26T15:43:16 * kavya has quit
2017-09-26T15:48:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hmmm... there even is a test where we check for "undefined" and expect false
2017-09-26T15:48:45 <kasparnet> ... could it be that we designed it so it would mimic javascripts truthy/non-truthy behavior
2017-09-26T15:48:56 <Bosmon> kasparnet - that\'s exactly how we didn\'t design it
2017-09-26T15:49:06 <kasparnet> well, with the exception of null
2017-09-26T15:49:43 <kasparnet> anyway - I really really gotta run now
2017-09-26T15:49:48 <kasparnet> I\'ll ping you tomorrow

2017-09-26T10:38:35 <jhernandez> stegru: morning
2017-09-26T10:39:08 <jhernandez> I saw that you already took GPII-2618
2017-09-26T10:39:29 <jhernandez> I can reproduce it here
2017-09-26T10:39:33 <stegru> yeh, me too
2017-09-26T10:39:42 <stegru> i started typing something then i had to go out
2017-09-26T10:39:55 <stegru> This only occurs if the background was set using the Windows 10 settings (as above).
2017-09-26T10:39:55 <stegru> If it was set using Control Panel (Control Panel\\Appearance and Personalization\\Personalization), or if the control panel window has been opened since, then it works as expected - the custom background restores.
2017-09-26T10:40:10 <jhernandez> hmmm
2017-09-26T10:40:13 <jhernandez> interesting
2017-09-26T10:42:11 <stegru> i think it\'s because when using the windows 10 settings, it doesn\'t add the wallpaper to the "theme"
2017-09-26T10:47:10 <jhernandez> ok - I can see the behavior now
2017-09-26T10:47:21 <jhernandez> pretty annoying
2017-09-26T10:47:46 <stegru> yeh
2017-09-26T10:47:51 <jhernandez> at least there\'s a workaround for it
2017-09-26T10:47:55 <stegru> is there?
2017-09-26T10:49:28 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-09-26T10:49:39 <jhernandez> I\'ve been playing around a bit and now I\'m logging in/out and I\'m getting the right background all the time  (no control panel or windows settings windows opened)
2017-09-26T10:50:38 <stegru> oh right ok, so it only happens when you set the wallpaper.. then almost immediately key-in?
2017-09-26T11:00:25 <jhernandez> not sure
2017-09-26T11:01:00 <jhernandez> even after rebooting, if you key-in/out then it doesn\'t restore to the previous one
2017-09-26T11:01:54 <stegru> we might have to store the wallpaper, then restore it again? javjarfer has done some work like this
2017-09-26T11:04:32 <jhernandez> yes
2017-09-26T11:05:01 <jhernandez> I was thinking the same
2017-09-26T11:05:22 <stegru> or make windows save the theme
2017-09-26T11:06:10 <jhernandez> well, I\'d go for the second
2017-09-26T11:07:21 <javjarfer> stegru, jhernandez, yes I think that the better option is to store the previous wallpaper if you want to recover it later
2017-09-26T11:08:00 <javjarfer> at least I have always seen people doing that for that case, maybe they run into the same unexpected behaviors
2017-09-26T11:08:07 <stegru> i\'d rather make windows do it.. update the theme to contain the current wallpaper
2017-09-26T11:08:12 <jhernandez> how are we going to get/set the background if the background is not part of the prefs set?
2017-09-26T11:08:29 <jhernandez> that\'s why I prefer to save the theme
2017-09-26T11:09:33 <stegru> i commented out the hight-contrast theme in win32.json, and it no longer fails
2017-09-26T11:12:24 <javjarfer> mmm theme API is annoying, it\'s true that maybe is the best way to save all the custom look, and also have a specified format, we can verify
2017-09-26T11:12:25 <javjarfer> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773190(v=vs.85).aspx#installing
2017-09-26T11:13:13 <javjarfer> but, the unique way for using it is through the "ShellExecute", which opens the personalization panel with the current theme for the user
2017-09-26T11:13:20 <javjarfer> not the kind of thing we are looking for
2017-09-26T11:13:42 <stegru> well, control panel does it so I\'m going to see how it does it
2017-09-26T11:15:41 <javjarfer> do you have any preferred tools for that kind of introspection?
2017-09-26T11:15:48 <jhernandez> okay, I\'ve found a pattern to work around the issue
2017-09-26T11:16:54 <stegru> ...?
2017-09-26T11:20:12 <stegru> javjarfer: procmon, look for something interesting, then see the stack looking for some function that looks right, then use http://yurichev.com/tracer-en.html (or API Monitor) to inspect the arguements passed to the function
2017-09-26T11:21:21 <jhernandez> stegru: Right click on background -> Personalize (Settings window pops up) ->  Select a wallpaper of your choice -> Once applied, on the left panel, click on Themes (now the theme has been saved) - You can close now the window and perform a login/logout, the wallpaper restores to the right one
2017-09-26T11:21:43 <stegru> ok
2017-09-26T11:25:28 <jhernandez> can you confirm that that "magic" works for you too? if so, I\'ll comment on the ticket with the workaround for Han and Maureen to use until the issue is fixed the right way
2017-09-26T11:26:20 <stegru> yes, it works
2017-09-26T11:27:12 <javjarfer> stegru, nice tools, I have used procmon, but never API Monitor
2017-09-26T11:27:26 <javjarfer> I will take a look at it, thanks
2017-09-26T11:28:33 <jhernandez> stegru: okay - I saw your comment on the ticket, but that didn\'t work for me

2017-09-26T11:41:09 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov - kasparnet and I wanted to update you on the revised approach to application terms in the PCP API
2017-09-26T11:41:37 <Bosmon> Our plan is to simplify this for the upcoming pilots and render all the terms that you will need to produce widgets for as common terms, although some of these will be scoped within applications
2017-09-26T11:41:55 <Bosmon> This will mean that you no longer need to consult the solutionsRegistryEntries for this round of work
2017-09-26T11:42:14 <Bosmon> kasparnet has written up https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2619 and is working on it now
2017-09-26T11:42:33 <Bosmon> There will be revisions of all the snapset preference sets in my branch in order to make them consistent with this approach
2017-09-26T12:15:06 <stegru> jhernandez: just clicking on "Themes" isn\'t enough - you also have to click on "Theme settings"
2017-09-26T12:15:16 <jhernandez> hah
2017-09-26T12:16:04 <stegru> perhaps I/we had the personalisation window open
2017-09-26T12:16:33 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-09-26T12:18:03 <jhernandez> in my case it works consistently

2017-09-26T12:50:59 <Bosmon> Would you like a team meeting tomorrow, or is it ok to wait until Monday?

2017-09-26T12:58:27 <Bosmon> dandimitrov, sure
2017-09-26T12:58:32 <Bosmon> In the meantime, are you getting on ok?
2017-09-26T12:58:38 <Bosmon> Is there something you would like me to take a look at?

2017-09-26T13:00:20 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-09-26T13:00:55 <dandimitrov> I\'ve opened a PR to Michelle\'s GPII-2092 branch. if you have time to have to have a look, it would be helpful :)
2017-09-26T13:01:10 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yup, I pointed michelled to that and she said she would review it shortly
2017-09-26T13:01:14 <Bosmon> To me it looks ok
2017-09-26T13:01:43 <Bosmon> I think we should punt tomorrow\'s meeting since people have been away a lot - it\'ll be too short notice for the other invitees to check whether they need to attend tomorrow morning
2017-09-26T13:01:51 <Bosmon> Let\'s meet again on Monday in our normal slot
2017-09-26T13:02:43 <simonjb> cindyli: I wanted to do some manual testing of GPII-2435 yesterday against a real CouchDB but was hitting a problem
2017-09-26T13:02:51 <simonjb> is https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2435/vagrant-configs/Vagrantfile the way to do that?
2017-09-26T13:02:57 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, sounds great, as it is a base feature on other branches (for the review) ^
2017-09-26T13:03:16 <simonjb> when I vagrant up, I get this error https://gist.github.com/simonbates/354f176f325104613bb25218e3a89de3
2017-09-26T13:04:03 <simonjb> I\'m guessing maybe because I was running on a Windows host? And seeing a problem with symlinks?
2017-09-26T13:04:49 <dandimitrov> Ok, Bosmon, if we\'re having serious troubles before Monday, we\'ll seek your assistance :)
2017-09-26T13:05:03 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - for sure, I\'ll be here :)
2017-09-26T13:05:16 <Bosmon> We hope to have kasparnet \'s update ready before the end of tomorrow, since he is going away for a while
2017-09-26T13:05:42 <Bosmon> cindyli - could I get you to look at another little one?
2017-09-26T13:05:44 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/852
2017-09-26T13:06:05 <Bosmon> And simonjb, to revisit this old chestnut - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/840
2017-09-26T13:06:08 <Bosmon> Thanks to all
2017-09-26T13:06:19 <cindyli> simonjb: i will give a try
2017-09-26T13:06:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: sure. will do
2017-09-26T13:06:41 <simonjb> for sure Bosmon

2017-09-26T13:07:57 <simonjb> oh and Bosmon, cindyli is super-close to wrapping up https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/519 -- do you have any concerns with me merging it when I\'ve done a bit more manual testing?
2017-09-26T13:10:17 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s great, doing one last round of review now
2017-09-26T13:11:04 <simonjb> cindyli: it looks like there\'s a conflict now with https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/519
