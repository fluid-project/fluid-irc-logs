2017-07-10T18:04:37 <jhung> colinclark, Justin_o: Here\'s a link to Pressbook\'s docs site. They\'re using WordPress GitHub Sync to sync content between GH and Wordpress. https://github.com/pressbooks/docs/
2017-07-10T18:05:35 <colinclark> now that\'s interesting!
2017-07-10T18:05:48 * avtar has quit
2017-07-10T18:06:14 <Justin_o> jhung: that\'s cool, could be helpful for our wordpress sites.. or were you thinking of moving out documentation site from docpad to wordpress?
2017-07-10T18:06:22 <colinclark> it appears to be bidirectional, which is really interesting
2017-07-10T18:07:07 <jhung> Justin_o: possibly. I\'m just thinking about the limitations of our current docs implementation. I rather like treating WP as a rendering / presentation platform, while keeping content in github.
2017-07-10T18:07:29 <colinclark> I guess the question, partly, is the deployment model
2017-07-10T18:07:48 <colinclark> What I think we ideally want, jhung, is an environment where WordPress was being used solely as an editing interface
2017-07-10T18:07:54 <colinclark> rather than as a content delivery system, too
2017-07-10T18:08:17 <colinclark> perhaps this would let us do that?
2017-07-10T18:09:05 <colinclark> I mean, I think the bast case for gtirloni is if our WordPress instances can typically be pretty heavily firewalled, so that we can take some pressure off the constant WP security patching cycle
2017-07-10T18:11:21 <jhung> true. I\'ve been wanting to revisit the topic of how we do docs. Now that we know a bit more, I wonder how we\'d do things differently colinclark.
2017-07-10T18:12:11 <gtirloni> i did some basic investigation on this but basically we need to assemble a deployment artifact that contains "wordpress core + themes + plugins" , but there\'s also the question of how to deal with content like you guys are talking about (database, where that comes from, etc)
2017-07-10T18:12:30 <colinclark> right
2017-07-10T18:12:47 <gtirloni> things like posts/pages seem fair to store somewhere, but there\'s core settings that are needed to

2017-07-10T18:26:41 <jhung> Justin_o, colinclark. michelled: Pressbooks is looking to do a revamp of their publishing UI. Their timeline is end of August. See: https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-publisher/milestone/1
2017-07-10T18:27:34 <colinclark> Do you know if they have any plans to look at things like keyboard navigation for their site?
2017-07-10T18:27:52 <colinclark> I don\'t know if I was just confused, but I had trouble nagivating the book created by our co-op students in PressBooks
2017-07-10T18:29:20 <jhung> colinclark: I\'m not sure. I\'m not sure if it\'s in this milestone or elsewhere.
2017-07-10T18:29:29 <colinclark> ok
2017-07-10T18:29:42 <colinclark> it would be cool to help them with some of those fundamentals, somehow.
2017-07-10T18:30:01 <colinclark> I sometimes worry that people misconstrue UI Options, and think that dropping it into their site solves their a11y problems
2017-07-10T18:30:10 <colinclark> instead of a way to augment their foundational accessibility techniques
2017-07-10T18:30:27 <colinclark> I\'m sure that\'s not the case here
2017-07-10T18:31:03 <jhung> colinclark: this would be a good time to at least address some fundamental a11y issues if they\'re redoing the theme. I\'ll find an opportunity to bring this up.
2017-07-10T18:31:12 <colinclark> cool
2017-07-10T18:31:25 <colinclark> as I say, it could have just been me
2017-07-10T18:31:41 <colinclark> but I think their book display UI was a bit funny in regards to keyboard navigation
2017-07-10T18:32:01 <colinclark> which also could suggest markup issues that would affect AT users
2017-07-10T18:35:29 <jhung> yeah. I\'ll shoot Ned a message and find out how we can best help.
2017-07-10T18:44:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, I think i figured out why the store tests were passing in infusion but not in the plugin. The store tests in infusion don\'t include the ContextAwareness.js. When I add that in, it starts triggering the cookie store\'s setter and getter methods instead. Incidentally the tests pass though, so i guess there\'s a bug in infusion.

2017-07-10T09:40:45 <stegru> hi amatas , I\'ve been having a look at the kibana link you sent.. is it ok for me to create a new dashboard to experiment with?
2017-07-10T09:41:27 <amatas> stegru, go ahead, but please if you improve something tell me how you did it
2017-07-10T09:41:52 <amatas> what do you want to experiment?
2017-07-10T09:42:22 <stegru> just the time duration things
2017-07-10T09:42:50 <stegru> also, curiosity
2017-07-10T09:43:12 <amatas> do you mean the time between session login and session logout for example?
2017-07-10T09:43:43 <stegru> yes, antranig doesn\'t like the way the logger code deals with this type of thing
2017-07-10T09:44:57 <amatas> yes, I saw it. I got the point, but it implies the execution of external scripts to build the data. Which raises other issues like, a place were to store and run those scripts, and of course the development of them.
2017-07-10T09:45:38 <stegru> i know... the "right" way isn\'t always the "best" way
2017-07-10T09:45:59 <stegru> well, "easy" way
2017-07-10T09:46:22 <amatas> yup, you\'re right
2017-07-10T10:01:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, all.  Just working on the NFC stuff that was mentioned on the list last week.  Just confirming whether the VM in the windows project has the drivers we need for the NFC reader.
2017-07-10T10:01:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I have the ACR122 model.
2017-07-10T10:02:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll find out soon enough, but I thought I\'d ask in case someone has tried using that VM for demos.
2017-07-10T10:04:56 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: we don\'t install additional drivers in the VMs, I hope that Windows 10 is able to install the new drivers when the reader is plugged
2017-07-10T10:05:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, I will confirm shortly.
2017-07-10T10:05:34 <the-t-in-rtf> The README in that project seems pretty old, just to confirm, is the high contrast hotfix included in the VMs by default or needed at all?
2017-07-10T10:05:55 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: also, here there are the drivers that we are installing at some AJCs: https://get.gpii.net/
2017-07-10T10:06:09 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, that\'s helpful.
2017-07-10T10:06:47 <the-t-in-rtf> or good to know about at least.  Depending on how it goes I might just set up the packages on my bootcamp partition.
2017-07-10T10:07:02 <amatas> :D good luck
2017-07-10T10:07:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'d still rather use the Vagrant image.  Speaking of which, is the listener started by default?
2017-07-10T10:07:27 <amatas> I\'ve tried to use the NFC reader that my laptop has without success
2017-07-10T10:07:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I have one of the standalone ones and I\'ve used it successfully with the GPII (but years ago).
2017-07-10T10:08:10 <amatas> mmm, if I remember well the listener is started by default once the GPII is installed
2017-07-10T10:08:36 <the-t-in-rtf> So, is the GPIi "installed" in the VM, or is that just for tests?
2017-07-10T10:08:42 <amatas> give a try to the installer that you can download from the site I pasted
2017-07-10T10:08:59 <amatas> no, the GPII is not installed by default
2017-07-10T10:09:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Do we have a demo VM or anything like that?
2017-07-10T10:09:41 <amatas> you can use a Windows 10 VM with the installer downloaded from here https://get.gpii.net/
2017-07-10T10:09:43 <amatas> it works well
2017-07-10T10:09:51 <the-t-in-rtf> No way to automate the install?
2017-07-10T10:09:51 <amatas> I\'m using this setup to test the metrics
2017-07-10T10:10:06 <amatas> no automation ATM, sorry
2017-07-10T10:10:34 <amatas> although you can add the steps to the .vagrant.yml, it\'s just download and install "silently"
2017-07-10T10:11:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you have an example of a .vagrant.yml that does something like this?
2017-07-10T10:11:00 <amatas> but I don\'t know if the silent installation has been tested before
2017-07-10T10:11:19 <amatas> let me search, it should be easy
2017-07-10T10:11:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks!
2017-07-10T10:11:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I have to say, it makes me sad to use any project (like windows) that doesn\'t use your setup.  Is someone already converting that?
2017-07-10T10:13:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Don\'t see an open PR....
2017-07-10T10:14:40 <amatas> I have that task in my list, but I\'m working right now on tasks with higher priority
2017-07-10T10:16:16 <amatas> well, thinking on that I have some work already done: https://gitlab.com/GPII-test/windows
2017-07-10T10:16:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you also have a task to publish a chocolatey package for our installer?
2017-07-10T10:16:33 <amatas> https://gitlab.com/GPII-test/universal
2017-07-10T10:17:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, with that, the setup would be a snap.
2017-07-10T10:18:25 <amatas> sure, but I guess that it hasn\'t be proposed due that we don\'t have a stable version of the GPII
2017-07-10T10:19:13 <amatas> that could be proposed in the next arch meeting, or at least open an issue to comment all the process to do so
2017-07-10T10:21:10 <amatas> The steps to download an install the GPII in the VM could be:
2017-07-10T10:21:13 <amatas> "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(\'https://get.gpii.net/GPII_HST_internal_testing_0.3.msi\'))"
2017-07-10T10:21:36 <amatas> "msiexec /i GPII_HST_internal_testing_0.3.msi /quiet /qn /norestart"

2017-07-10T11:20:26 <stegru> amatas: you\'re right about elastic search not being capable. I tried to do the query in sql, hoping to convert it with an online converter but it\'s like putting a square peg in a round hole
2017-07-10T11:22:11 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-07-10T11:23:22 <amatas> hehe, nice try. Yes, it seems that elastic search is not so flexible as other RBM databases. Perhaps because of that is so fast with big amount of data
2017-07-10T11:23:24 <stegru> so yes, there will need to be some sort of "data import" routine
2017-07-10T11:23:33 <stegru> yes
2017-07-10T11:24:41 <stegru> my statement was something like: select max(timestamp) - min(timestamp) from table group by sessionID
2017-07-10T11:33:47 <amatas> I want to try some features like "script query" https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-script-query.html
2017-07-10T11:34:35 <amatas> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23908643/arithmetic-operations-with-fields
2017-07-10T11:39:23 <stegru> yes, that\'s what I was looking at (didn\'t know how to put it into a "visualizer"), but i could test it in the developer section
2017-07-10T11:40:15 <stegru> oh no, i see what you mean now

2017-07-10T14:04:26 <mrtyler> VidyoDesktopTM says "starting up..." for the last 3 minutes
2017-07-10T14:04:32 <mrtyler> let\'s try again
2017-07-10T14:17:53 <gtirloni> mrtyler: sometimes when you switch from using Vidyo on phone or different OS, it seems VidyoDesktop gets stuck trying to authenticate with outdated credentials and timeouts out.. then if you try again, it usually logs in immediately... in my experience. It happens here when I login on Windows/phone, then go back to Linux
2017-07-10T14:18:26 <gtirloni> it\'s usually faster to just cancel login, then it opens the user/pass screen and login right away
2017-07-10T14:18:42 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i never use vidyo. when i do, it\'s from one machine only. however the other things you describe are what happened to me
