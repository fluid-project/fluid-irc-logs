2017-08-17T19:15:05 <jhung> 5 minutes michelled and Justin_o?
2017-08-17T19:15:42 <Justin_o> jhung: sure
2017-08-17T19:15:53 <michelled> that could work
2017-08-17T19:16:56 <danayo> jhung: lost you - I will take a look at the UIO page
2017-08-17T19:17:04 <danayo> keeping in mind the broad audience

2017-08-17T19:30:22 <grrrero> Justin_o: Got your comment... sorry about that. I totally forgot about the format :\\ So how do I squash the commits to just one?
2017-08-17T19:31:22 <Justin_o> grrrero: there\'s probably a few ways, one is to use git reset --soft <commit hash> where commit hash is the one before your first commit
2017-08-17T19:31:46 <grrrero> Ok I\'ll look it up! Justin_o
2017-08-17T19:33:22 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay, let me know if you need help
2017-08-17T19:33:28 <grrrero> Ok thanks Justin_o
2017-08-17T19:34:53 <michelled> alanharnum, danayo, gmoss: my room?
2017-08-17T19:37:31 <grrrero> Justin_o: Read up on it a bit
2017-08-17T19:37:40 <grrrero> So I think this is the commit hash I want to revert to? git reset --soft 887bf14714126f18a7168ecfd16dc34acf2dcc74
2017-08-17T19:38:17 <grrrero> I did a git log and got it from there
2017-08-17T19:41:09 <Justin_o> grrrero: assuming that\'s the correct hash, that looks good
2017-08-17T19:41:38 <Justin_o> after you run that command, then you should just be able to recommit
2017-08-17T19:43:16 <grrrero> Justin_o: Check now?
2017-08-17T19:44:12 <Justin_o> grrrero: did you push up?
2017-08-17T19:44:21 <grrrero> Trying but it wants me to do a pull first
2017-08-17T19:44:24 <Justin_o> you\'ll probably need to do "git push origin -f "
2017-08-17T19:45:14 <grrrero> Check now?
2017-08-17T19:54:10 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks for the fix, I\'ve merged in your PR ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/841 )
2017-08-17T19:54:22 <grrrero> Awesome thanks for all your help Justin_o

2017-08-17T21:22:04 <colinclark> Can you do me a quick favour?
2017-08-17T21:22:36 <colinclark> Can you point me to any and all dashboard-related design artifacts that take into account the GPII and the AJCs?
2017-08-17T21:22:53 <colinclark> This can also include education-related wireframes, since the next round of pilots for APCP will be in community colleges
2017-08-17T21:23:45 <danayo> colinclark: sure. when you say education-related, you still mean those that take into account GPII and AJC\'s, right?
2017-08-17T21:23:52 <colinclark> no
2017-08-17T21:24:12 <colinclark> Either wireframes that take into account the AJCs or those that are more education-oriented
2017-08-17T21:24:17 <colinclark> either is good :)
2017-08-17T21:24:49 <danayo> ok. i think that covers pretty much all of our artifacts! :) but I can indicate which ones take into account GPII and AJCs
2017-08-17T21:26:39 <colinclark> :)
2017-08-17T21:26:54 <colinclark> well, maybe I can narrow this down
2017-08-17T21:27:14 <colinclark> can you send me links to a) all the ones that take into account GPII and AJCs, and b) the finest and most exemplary of the others? :)

2017-08-17T21:51:22 <danayo> done
2017-08-17T21:52:11 <gmoss> General IDRC question, apologies if this isn\'t the correct venue: if I\'m the last to leave, do I need to close the "outer" door that separates the kitchen from the main hallway?
2017-08-17T21:56:14 * colinclark has quit
2017-08-17T21:58:35 <danayo> gmoss: as far as I know it\'s ok to leave that outer door open to the kitchen, as long as the inner door is closed & locked (as well as the door at the front too). does that sound right alanharnum? I haven\'t been there in a while...

2017-08-17T14:53:29 <jhung> grrrero: That\'s what I get as well. The theme is either lacking styling, or I stripped a classname I shouldn\'t have. I\'ll take a deeper look.
2017-08-17T14:53:48 <grrrero> jhung: Ok! At least I know we\'re on the same page -- we can work on the styling

2017-08-17T16:54:45 <grrrero> Justin_o: We\'re not removing any of them anymore, so it\'s no longer needed?
2017-08-17T16:54:57 <grrrero> What do you think ^
2017-08-17T16:55:04 <Justin_o> grrrero: ah okay, we kept all ofthem
2017-08-17T16:55:14 <grrrero> Yeah I found one thing or another was breaking
2017-08-17T16:55:46 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay, i\'ll just close it as won\'t fix
2017-08-17T16:56:08 <grrrero> Justin_o: Sounds good
2017-08-17T16:56:12 <jhung> grrrero: could you make a comment about it in the pull request and I\'ll make sure to investigate it. It shouldn\'t be hard to do either way.
2017-08-17T16:56:22 <grrrero> jhung: Ok!
2017-08-17T16:56:40 <jhung> thanks for testing that!

2017-08-17T17:08:59 <danayo> ok michelled
2017-08-17T17:14:12 <grrrero> jhung: Also is the secret answer case-sensitive?
2017-08-17T17:16:08 <jhung> grrrero: no it isn\'t. The answer is converted to lower case.
2017-08-17T17:16:18 <grrrero> Oh ok jhung
2017-08-17T17:16:41 <jhung> Just needs to contain the same characters and spacing.
2017-08-17T17:16:49 <grrrero> Ok cool
2017-08-17T17:18:25 <jhung> grrrero: Do you think there needs to be some additional labelling / description about that?

2017-08-17T18:20:50 <grrrero> Ok
2017-08-17T18:20:51 <Justin_o> grrrero: is it all ready to go?
2017-08-17T18:20:59 <grrrero> Maybe gonna tweak some a bit more
2017-08-17T18:21:12 <grrrero> Justin_o ^
2017-08-17T18:21:31 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay, yah probably easier to do all those tweaks ahead of time, because you\'ll have to submit pull requests afterwards. Also did you run it by danayo and jhung_away ?
2017-08-17T18:21:48 <grrrero> I\'ll do that now! Justin_o
