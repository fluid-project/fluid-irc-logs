2017-01-04T21:01:30 <colinclark> IBM's various things were very popular amongst some in the community until recently
2017-01-04T21:01:43 <mrtyler> terraform is hashicorp afaik
2017-01-04T21:01:55 <mrtyler> (whose products i, generally, enjoy a lot more than ibm's)
2017-01-04T21:02:00 <colinclark> yeah, it is
2017-01-04T21:02:04 <colinclark> and yes, me too :)
2017-01-04T21:02:28 <mrtyler> that said, my next proposal will be to throw away jira and git and install RationalRose
2017-01-04T21:02:35 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-04T21:02:45 <colinclark> You'll make a lot of new friends in your first few days :P
2017-01-04T21:03:22 <mrtyler> and to think that's before you've even tried my carrot cake
2017-01-04T21:03:49 <mrtyler> ok so if we currently have nothing in commercial cloud, i guess i'd be figuring that stuff out when i go to start experimenting in aws or wherever?
2017-01-04T21:04:05 <mrtyler> maybe i'll bug sandra for the credit card number :)
2017-01-04T21:06:03 <colinclark> yes :)

2017-01-04T17:51:53 <amatas> hi mrtyler !
2017-01-04T17:52:06 <colinclark> hey, you made it, mrtyler!
2017-01-04T17:52:15 <colinclark> welcome back to the \'90s, here in IRC :)
2017-01-04T17:52:16 <mrtyler> :)
2017-01-04T17:52:23 <mrtyler> whatever, i love irc
2017-01-04T17:52:41 <colinclark> don\'t we all
2017-01-04T17:52:42 <mrtyler> altho my irssi->growl pipeline seems broken currently :(
2017-01-04T17:53:03 <mrtyler> yelp used irc almost exclusively
2017-01-04T17:53:08 <mrtyler> in spite of acquiring a few companies that prefer slack
2017-01-04T17:53:29 <mrtyler> leading to slack<->irc gateways
2017-01-04T17:55:55 <amatas> mrtyler, seems that Gio and Avtar are on vacation. If I can help you with something related to the Ops side ping me
2017-01-04T17:56:59 <colinclark> amatas: Yes, Gio will be back next week
2017-01-04T17:57:05 <colinclark> Avtar too :)
2017-01-04T17:57:23 <colinclark> At which point we will dive into our next steps and planning in earnest
2017-01-04T17:57:29 <amatas> sure
2017-01-04T17:57:44 <colinclark> mrtyler: Avtar seemed pretty confident that you\'d have lots to stay busy with just reading and learning in the interim
2017-01-04T17:57:49 <colinclark> but let me know if that\'s not the case
2017-01-04T17:57:57 <gloob> aha
2017-01-04T17:57:59 <gloob> osx lover
2017-01-04T17:58:01 <gloob> great
2017-01-04T17:58:14 <mrtyler> amatas: thanks. i def want to catch up with you at some point.
2017-01-04T17:58:14 <amatas> well I\'ll be out on friday and tomorrow afternoon (my time)
2017-01-04T17:58:16 <gloob> but growl is pretty dead right?
2017-01-04T17:58:31 <mrtyler> amatas: colinclark yeah i\'m ok for now, just going through GPII-2009 and all its descendents
2017-01-04T17:58:36 <colinclark> ok great
2017-01-04T17:58:41 <mrtyler> also learning about grunt and ansible and looking at kubernetes deploy strategies
2017-01-04T17:58:43 <amatas> cool
2017-01-04T17:59:00 * mrtyler fingers gloob and expects to find Client: mIRC

2017-01-04T20:52:46 <colinclark> Hi mrtyler, you had some private questions I thought were worth answering here if that\'s okay...
2017-01-04T20:52:57 <mrtyler> sure
2017-01-04T20:53:17 <colinclark> First, you\'ll probably want to take a bit of time to read the GPII\'s technical governance material on the wiki
2017-01-04T20:53:18 <colinclark> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Technical_Governance
2017-01-04T20:53:36 <colinclark> That\'ll help you with the basics of what it takes to earn committership over time
2017-01-04T20:53:44 <colinclark> it\'s a slow trust-building process
2017-01-04T20:54:15 <colinclark> and employees of our various partner organizations, too, have to earn committership
2017-01-04T20:54:38 <colinclark> So the reason why you weren\'t able to join the gpii-committers mailing list is because it\'s a private forum
2017-01-04T20:54:46 <colinclark> the only private form we have, in fact :)
2017-01-04T20:55:07 <mrtyler> ok np
2017-01-04T20:55:11 <colinclark> It\'s only used for voting for commit access and discussion of very rare technical governance issues
2017-01-04T20:55:17 <colinclark> but I look forward to the day when I can add you to it :)
2017-01-04T20:55:41 <colinclark> In term of the Github organization, it\'s a similar situation for the core repositories
2017-01-04T20:55:51 <mrtyler> sure
2017-01-04T20:56:02 <colinclark> but I believe we have a few different groups, including one which contributors can join
2017-01-04T20:56:20 <colinclark> We do have some ops-related repositories that are techincallly governed under somewhat looser standards
2017-01-04T20:56:25 <colinclark> and some that are private
2017-01-04T20:56:35 <colinclark> by virtue of the fact that they are infrastructure-specific
2017-01-04T20:56:51 <mrtyler> private because they are infra-specific?
2017-01-04T20:57:14 <colinclark> Meaning, they\'re specific to our servers
2017-01-04T20:57:22 <colinclark> etc.
2017-01-04T20:57:37 <mrtyler> i don\'t think that\'s a good reason to make them private but noted
2017-01-04T20:57:43 <colinclark> One of your goals with Giovanni will be to determine which things in our ops org can be reasonably moved to fully code-reviewed, governed repositories, and which are a little more informal in that regards
2017-01-04T20:58:00 <colinclark> mrtyler: I\'m glad you think that :) :)
2017-01-04T20:58:11 <colinclark> usually I have to convince people the other way!
2017-01-04T20:58:18 <mrtyler> information wants to be free, maaaan
2017-01-04T20:58:21 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-04T20:58:27 <colinclark> let\'s aim to review all our stuff with Gio when he\'s back
2017-01-04T20:58:35 <mrtyler> i\'ll make a note
2017-01-04T20:59:01 <colinclark> and with amatas
2017-01-04T20:59:04 <colinclark> thanks
2017-01-04T20:59:11 <mrtyler> i\'ll follow up with them
2017-01-04T20:59:36 <colinclark> In terms of cloud accounts, etc., the only cloud we\'re currently using is our infrastructure, hosted here at the IDRC
2017-01-04T20:59:51 <colinclark> Gio and alanharnum are in charge of that infrastructure
2017-01-04T21:00:08 <colinclark> and, with time, will share whatever kind of access you need
2017-01-04T21:00:26 <colinclark> but I think we\'ll be looking towards doing more test deployment on AWS very soon
2017-01-04T21:00:37 <mrtyler> i also think that
2017-01-04T21:00:40 <colinclark> with the caveat that we want to remain cloud service-agnostic in terms of what we develop against
2017-01-04T21:00:52 <mrtyler> right
2017-01-04T21:01:03 <mrtyler> i already looked at and rejected Cloudformation for this very reason :)
2017-01-04T21:01:07 <colinclark> :)
2017-01-04T21:01:12 <colinclark> Meaning, we want the GPII itself to be deployable on\xe2\x80\x94at least\xe2\x80\x94AWS, Azure, and another cloud
2017-01-04T21:01:12 <mrtyler> i expect we will use Terraform
2017-01-04T21:01:20 <mrtyler> even tho my former coworkers called it Terrorform
