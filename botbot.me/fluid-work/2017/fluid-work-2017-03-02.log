b'2017-03-02T15:03:24 <Justin_o> alanharn_: i did, prior to the switch over. but i\'m subscribed with both e-mails to the e-mail lists, but only receive through gmail
2017-03-02T15:03:35 <alanharn_> OK.
2017-03-02T15:03:58 <Justin_o> gtirloni: alanharn_ and I are talking about our mailing list e-mails being flagged as potential spam
2017-03-02T15:04:32 <gtirloni> yeah, just noticed it
2017-03-02T15:04:34 <alanharn_> gtirloni: i\'m about to send an email that I\'ll CC you on, but it looks like they\'ve turned on some anti-spoofing warning in the new Outlook client
2017-03-02T15:04:48 <gtirloni> i think it\'s on the server side
2017-03-02T15:05:07 <Justin_o> alanharn_: i\'m getting that warning in gmail too though, so it\'s probably more than just the outlook client
2017-03-02T15:05:56 <gtirloni> they probably didn\'t include our servers in the migration
2017-03-02T15:06:10 <gtirloni> we had them whitelist in ocad\'s own exchange servers
2017-03-02T15:06:11 * javjarfer joined the channel
2017-03-02T15:06:30 <alanharn_> gtirloni: did we just email Yong directly the last time we had this issue?
2017-03-02T15:06:36 <gtirloni> yep
2017-03-02T15:06:42 <alanharn_> that may be quicker than what I was about to do (email IT help desk)
2017-03-02T15:06:54 <gtirloni> let me find the email we sent previously
2017-03-02T15:07:48 <alanharn_> i\'ll route this email to Yong and CC you
2017-03-02T15:08:05 <gtirloni> ok
2017-03-02T15:09:09 <gtirloni> alanharn_ Justin_o: was my last email flagged too?
2017-03-02T15:09:44 <alanharn_> gtirloni: nope
2017-03-02T15:09:45 <Justin_o> alanharn_: which one was that?
2017-03-02T15:09:53 * michelled joined the channel
2017-03-02T15:09:56 <alanharn_> was that from your OCADU email, or another one?
2017-03-02T15:10:02 <alanharn_> it appears to only flag OCADU emails
2017-03-02T15:10:06 <gtirloni> ok, it\'s definitely their DMARC policy
2017-03-02T15:10:37 <gtirloni> yeah, i think they should whitelist us in office 365
2017-03-02T15:10:40 <Justin_o> gtirloni: the one to the everyone list was flagged for me in gmail
2017-03-02T15:10:55 <alanharn_> gtirloni: emailed
2017-03-02T15:11:09 <gtirloni> Justin_o: did it have the "[This sender failed our..." message or was it flagged by gmail itself?
2017-03-02T15:11:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i believe by gmail
2017-03-02T15:11:33 <alanharn_> ah, Yong\'s outlook picture is of her and a cat
2017-03-02T15:11:37 <alanharn_> ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
2017-03-02T15:11:48 <gtirloni> haha
2017-03-02T15:11:51 <Justin_o> lol
2017-03-02T15:12:06 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i can\'t take a screen shot of the issue, but you\'re welcome to look over my shoulder
2017-03-02T15:12:35 <gtirloni> ok :)
2017-03-02T15:13:56 <gtirloni> the issue happens because our servers are relaying the emails with their original sender address.. OCAD needs to add as as being part of their servers. they did this in the SPF records but this is something else... and it only happens when the emails reach OCAD\'s servers again
2017-03-02T15:14:34 <gtirloni> but if gmail is flagging them also.. it\'s something else
2017-03-02T15:14:48 <gtirloni> i know gmail doesn\'t change the body of the messages
2017-03-02T15:15:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: it only showed up for the test e-mail you sent to the everyone list, my other e-mails there don\'t have that
2017-03-02T15:15:56 <gtirloni> ah ok
2017-03-02T15:16:07 <gtirloni> then it\'s more likely to be the DMARC policy

2017-03-02T16:32:30 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I\'m very unhappy and would like to talk with you about it
2017-03-02T16:32:43 <Bosmon> Hey there kasparnet
2017-03-02T16:32:54 <Bosmon> Is your unhappiness something to do with the fact that you must be destroyed?
2017-03-02T16:32:55 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon :)
2017-03-02T16:33:02 <kasparnet> Bosmon: haha
2017-03-02T16:33:03 <Bosmon> Or damned, or some such thing?
2017-03-02T16:33:26 <kasparnet> well, I got used to that a while back - and have reached a point where i appreciate the occasional damning
2017-03-02T16:33:37 <kasparnet> no - the thing is that there is something wrong with the current isRunning approach
2017-03-02T16:33:48 <kasparnet> and I\'m not quite sure how to best deal with it
2017-03-02T16:34:15 <Bosmon> ok
2017-03-02T16:34:22 <kasparnet> so, as you know, "isRunning" directives are currently stuck inside "settingsHandler" blocks
2017-03-02T16:34:33 <kasparnet> which are referenced from within start and stop directives
2017-03-02T16:34:55 <kasparnet> (like we reference regular settingshandlers inside configure and restore blocks)
2017-03-02T16:35:16 <kasparnet> but we need a general way of checking "is this application running"
2017-03-02T16:35:49 <kasparnet> which would be a step in the lifecycle manager when logging in -- ie. running "update" instead of "start" if an application is already running
2017-03-02T16:36:17 <kasparnet> anyway - with our current structure, it\'s not clear how to check whether "this application is running"
2017-03-02T16:37:01 <kasparnet> except for looking at the entries in start (or stop?!) and for each of the launch handler entries there, doing a ".get" call
2017-03-02T16:37:14 <kasparnet> dont know if I\'m making any sense
2017-03-02T16:37:22 <kasparnet> or whether it\'s easier to explain via skype
2017-03-02T16:38:40 * kasparnet is grabbing a cup of tea, while trying to calm down
2017-03-02T16:41:40 * avtar joined the channel
2017-03-02T16:41:54 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2017-03-02T16:41:55 <Bosmon> Sure
2017-03-02T16:42:30 <Bosmon> I thought we were already exterminating our current "isRunning" approach
2017-03-02T16:42:37 <Bosmon> In favour of treating lifecycle actions like settings handlers
2017-03-02T16:46:35 <kasparnet> well, we sort of did..
2017-03-02T16:46:54 <kasparnet> but even if "isRunning" do not exist
2017-03-02T16:47:15 <kasparnet> there is no clarity of the decision as to "which settingshandler should i query to see if an applicaiton is running"
2017-03-02T16:49:03 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2017-03-02T16:49:14 <Bosmon> Well, we will have to distinguish one
2017-03-02T16:49:22 <Bosmon> They already do have names
2017-03-02T16:56:15 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so you\'re thinking that we should add a new top level directive referencing one or more settingshandlers
2017-03-02T16:56:24 <kasparnet> which we would call the "get" function for?
2017-03-02T16:56:35 <Bosmon> Yes, or perhaps just make a convention
2017-03-02T16:58:12 <kasparnet> ok... that makes sense
2017-03-02T16:58:51 <kasparnet> There is still a bit of akwardness surrounding this launchHandlers as settingsHandlers stuff, in my mind
2017-03-02T16:58:59 <kasparnet> but let me get a pull request ready
2017-03-02T16:59:26 <kasparnet> and then you can see what I mean
2017-03-02T17:00:19 <kasparnet> but the solution for my current source of unhappiness is found - so I\'ll implement that and then I think the pull should be close
2017-03-02T17:00:27 <Bosmon> Sounds great
2017-03-02T17:00:30 <Bosmon> This will solve so many things
2017-03-02T17:00:37 <Bosmon> As we saw in our meeting only yesterday

2017-03-02T10:22:24 <stegru> javjarfer: here\'s the powershell i used to test the message: https://gist.github.com/stegru/adaff444da2d11102b0563b9eed97cb5
2017-03-02T10:25:00 <javjarfer> stegru, the window handle you are using there, "0x00020078" it\'s the one referring the windows explorer true?
2017-03-02T10:25:15 <stegru> oh yes, that\'s the taskbar
2017-03-02T10:25:25 <stegru> I tried HWND_BROADCAST at first
2017-03-02T10:26:01 <javjarfer> stegru, okay, so again it looks like Microsoft doesn\'t like to deploy good hooks for settings reloading
2017-03-02T10:27:59 <javjarfer> are there specific settings we know that message reload on the fly?
2017-03-02T10:28:10 <stegru> i don\'t know
2017-03-02T10:28:29 <stegru> it\'s up to whoever develops the window that receives that message
2017-03-02T10:29:10 <stegru> but, i think i\'ve got something now..
2017-03-02T10:29:41 <stegru> I changed the registry value, and when I killed "SearchUI.exe" it restarted itself and the search icon now appears
2017-03-02T10:30:13 <stegru> oh, but it doesn\'t remove it when you set it to 0
2017-03-02T10:30:28 <javjarfer> oh, great consistence

2017-03-02T10:34:55 <stegru> javjarfer: I need to fix my windows development VM first, but I think I can convince the taskbar that one of those menu items have been clicked
2017-03-02T10:35:14 <stegru> (right click, then search sub-menu)
2017-03-02T10:35:47 * sirdancealot has quit
2017-03-02T10:36:52 <javjarfer> stegru, yes, that was my other approach, UI Automation
2017-03-02T10:37:06 <javjarfer> but right now, we can only do that using C#
2017-03-02T10:37:42 <javjarfer> It was ongoing research for Learning Tools
2017-03-02T10:38:48 <stegru> well, that\'s not exactly the method I have in mind
2017-03-02T10:39:05 <stegru> when a menu item has been clicked, a message is sent to the window
2017-03-02T10:39:25 <stegru> I\'m just going to send that particular message to the taskbar
2017-03-02T10:39:37 <stegru> sort of like UI Automation, but at a lower level
2017-03-02T10:39:57 <javjarfer> stegru, ooh okay, that is great, which software do you use to inspect that messages?
2017-03-02T10:40:13 <stegru> spy++, comes with visual studio
2017-03-02T10:40:35 <stegru> or is it called winspy++?
2017-03-02T10:42:23 <javjarfer> I don\'t know, the one I have been use is the one that comes with the Windows Development kit, AccEvent
2017-03-02T10:42:43 <stegru> the message is wm_syscommand, but there\'s a parameter of that which points to the menu item
2017-03-02T10:46:04 <javjarfer> stegru, ah\xc3\xa1, and you need to know the "id" of that menu item no?
2017-03-02T10:46:11 <stegru> yep
2017-03-02T10:46:48 <stegru> there\'s a billion hours left on my visual studio install
2017-03-02T10:49:44 <javjarfer> hahaha
2017-03-02T10:49:51 <javjarfer> so, normal installation time
2017-03-02T10:50:06 <javjarfer> which is the name of the id you need?
2017-03-02T10:50:30 <javjarfer> maybe inspect.exe can help with that
2017-03-02T10:58:36 <stegru> the id of the menu item
2017-03-02T10:59:12 <stegru> but, i\'m not sure this will work now, because on another VM the right-click menu isn\'t a normal menu
2017-03-02T11:00:20 <javjarfer> stegru, the automation id is "447"
2017-03-02T11:00:49 <javjarfer> of the "hidden" pane Cortana menu item
2017-03-02T11:00:58 <stegru> ok

2017-03-02T12:31:30 <javjarfer> stegru, I\'m not able to see the messages passed to "Shell_TrayWnd" handle: 00010110, using Spy++, is that your case?
2017-03-02T12:32:23 <stegru> i haven\'t yet
2017-03-02T12:33:01 <stegru> i think the best way for now is to just re-start explorer like you was going to
2017-03-02T12:33:14 <stegru> i think the code for this is going to get complicated
2017-03-02T12:33:49 <stegru> it\'s just the hassle of getting the right window handle
2017-03-02T12:36:53 <javjarfer> stegru, ok, problem was \'bitness\' 64bit code is needed in order to introspect this with message passing
2017-03-02T12:37:47 <stegru> yes, it needs to match the other process
2017-03-02T12:37:55 <javjarfer> Okay, I will them document this, but I think it\'s a good start point of research, because UI Automation for Learning Tools is needed, and other ways of process
2017-03-02T12:38:02 <stegru> yeh
2017-03-02T12:38:09 <javjarfer> of proceeding* could be valuable in the future
2017-03-02T12:38:27 <javjarfer> stegru, thanks you! I\'m going to continue the research taking this into account

2017-03-02T14:33:12 <alanharn_> has anyone else started seeing "[This sender failed our fraud detection checks and may not be who they appear to be. Learn about spoofing at http://aka.ms/LearnAboutSpoofing]" mesages in anything they get from our mailing lists?
2017-03-02T14:34:23 <Justin_o> alanharn_: not that i\'ve noticed.. where are you seeing that? in the e-mails?
2017-03-02T14:34:36 <alanharn_> Justin_o: yeah, in emails on my desktop client at home
2017-03-02T14:35:15 <alanharn_> I see it in the web client as well.
2017-03-02T14:35:52 <Justin_o> alanharn_: I just checked one now, but don\'t see it.. are you using ocad e-mail to get the mailing list?
2017-03-02T14:35:59 <Justin_o> mine are sent to gmail, so that could be why i\'m not seeing it
2017-03-02T14:36:23 <alanharn_> terrible UX - it appears at the top of the email and looks like part of it, but it isn\'t in the email itself per the archive at http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2017-March/010322.html
2017-03-02T14:37:31 <Justin_o> alanharn_: we should probably investigate why it\'s getting flagged though and see if others are getting that as well
2017-03-02T14:37:51 <alanharn_> yeah I\'ll send an email to OCAD IT
2017-03-02T14:38:03 <Justin_o> alanharn_: thanks for looking into that
2017-03-02T14:39:36 <alanharn_> it looks like it\'s an Outlook thing, but the UX is really bad: http://imgur.com/a/37zvZ
2017-03-02T14:41:17 <Justin_o> alanharn_: is it specifically with outlook for ocad email or outlook in general. That is, does it have to do with some security setting on ocad\'s side or built into outlook?
2017-03-02T14:41:36 <alanharn_> not sure - it appears in both the webmail and desktop client for me
2017-03-02T14:41:59 <Justin_o> alanharn_: sort of wondering how pervasive the issue is, and if there is a way that we can figure out why it\'s failing the fraud detection
2017-03-02T14:42:33 <alanharn_> i\'m guessing it may be because of the emails appearing to come from OCADU addresses, but actually being sent by MLs
2017-03-02T14:42:44 <alanharn_> I see the same warning for Simon\'s everybody email from this morning
2017-03-02T14:43:23 <Justin_o> alanharn_: :( that would be unfortunate.. my guess is that those all originate from the same mailing server, or type of server at least.. could it be something to do with that?
2017-03-02T14:43:51 <Justin_o> are you subscribed to any other mailing lists, and if so, do you get similar warnings?
2017-03-02T14:44:20 <alanharn_> I am subscribed to a number of other MLs and don\'t see the same warnings
2017-03-02T14:44:31 <alanharn_> i also don\'t think I saw them from the OCADU lists until today
2017-03-02T14:46:24 <Justin_o> oh really.. that\'s curious..
2017-03-02T14:46:59 <Justin_o> should be helpful to track things down, if something changed overnight
2017-03-02T14:47:39 * clown joined the channel
2017-03-02T14:47:51 <alanharn_> Justin_o: I wonder if you could send something to the ML from a non-OCADU account as a test, to see if I see the warning?
2017-03-02T14:48:27 <Justin_o> alanharn_: i sent a reply on the fluid-work list from my gmail e-mail this morning
2017-03-02T14:48:36 <Justin_o> it was to the thread about yesterday\'s community meeting
2017-03-02T14:48:55 <alanharn_> Justin_o: ah, see it now - yes, no warning
2017-03-02T14:49:12 <alanharn_> so I think this is a specific security configuration around [x]@ocadu.ca emails
2017-03-02T14:50:09 <Justin_o> alanharn_: nice sleuthing, but this is problematic for us. I hope it\'s something we can get IT to fix
2017-03-02T14:50:26 <alanharn_> Justin_o: I suspect we can get them to whitelist the ML addresses or similar
2017-03-02T14:50:47 <Justin_o> alanharn_: although was it only for your own e-mails that you are getting that warning, or from anyone with an ocadu.ca email?
2017-03-02T14:51:02 <alanharn_> It appears to be from anyone with an ocadu address
2017-03-02T14:51:22 <alanharn_> I see it for simonjb\'s email to the everybody list, FE
2017-03-02T14:51:32 <Justin_o> alanharn_: okay, hopefully the whitelisting will work then
2017-03-02T14:52:03 <alanharn_> And I see it for your Goodlife Marathon email to everyone list (from your OCADU account), but not your fluid-work one from your gmail account
2017-03-02T14:52:07 <clown> anyone:  whenever I edit on wiki.fluidproject.org I get a notification:
2017-03-02T14:52:14 <clown> "Loading the editor\'s taking longer than usual. Give it a few moments, then refresh your page if it still doesn\'t load. Speak to your Confluence admin if that doesn\'t fix it."
2017-03-02T14:52:34 <clown> Nothing untoward seems to happen, so is this a real issue?
2017-03-02T14:52:49 <Justin_o> clown: hmm.. not sure
2017-03-02T14:52:54 <Bosmon> Hi there alanharn_, simonjb - I\'ve pushed some "blind fixes" for the Visible Nexus issues saw last night
2017-03-02T14:53:05 <alanharn_> Bosmon: yay - thanks Bosmon!
2017-03-02T14:53:13 <Justin_o> clown: was this only for today, or other times as well?
2017-03-02T14:53:15 <Bosmon> That is, the failure to construct local components whose type is a remote grade, and the model path deletion issue
2017-03-02T14:53:30 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon -- I\'m taking today off and will check them out tomorrow
2017-03-02T14:53:35 <Bosmon> I\'ll just work on a quick solution to make the popup panel resizable now, and see why the yellow highlighting isn\'t working on Firefox
2017-03-02T14:53:48 <Bosmon> Awesome, simonjb - have a great day off :)
2017-03-02T14:56:16 <clown> Justin_o:  this happened Tue as well.
2017-03-02T14:56:38 <clown> And yesterday when I tried to add links to my slides.
2017-03-02T14:56:59 <Justin_o> clown: it might just be a connection issue or something to do with the editor loading at that moment. It does support collaborative editing now, so could be related to that as well.
2017-03-02T14:57:08 <Justin_o> clown: but you were able to edit and save?
2017-03-02T14:57:58 <alanharn_> Justin_o: do you see those warnings in the webmail client / desktop client for the same emails I see them for, or is this something unique to me?
2017-03-02T14:58:00 <clown> Justin_o: yes, except for one occasion where nothing was saved, and I had to create the page again.  Luckily it was early and I only lost a paragraph.

2017-03-02T15:01:02 <Justin_o> alanharn_: actually if i look at it on the web in gmail i do get two warnings. 1) Gmail couldn\'t verify that ocadu.ca actually sent this message (and not a spammer). 2) inclusivedesign.ca did not encrypt this message
2017-03-02T15:01:39 <alanharn_> Justin_o: do you see it in the OCADU web client for your Goodlife message, or Simon\'s message?
2017-03-02T15:01:48 <Justin_o> the first is a large "?" that shows up as the avatar for the sender the send is an unlocked lock icon that shows up next to the "to"
2017-03-02T15:01:59 <Justin_o> alanharn_: ^
2017-03-02T15:02:27 <alanharn_> ah, do you get your ocadu email through gmail as well?
