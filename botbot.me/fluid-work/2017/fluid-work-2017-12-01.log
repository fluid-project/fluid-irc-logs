b'2017-12-01T20:51:09 <colinclark> mostly
2017-12-01T20:51:15 <colinclark> there is an "options map"
2017-12-01T20:51:18 <colinclark> which is a bit of a drag
2017-12-01T20:51:42 <sgithens> these are all CM options right?
2017-12-01T20:51:43 <sgithens> https://github.com/colinbdclark/codemirror-infusion/blob/master/demo/demo.js#L56-L68
2017-12-01T20:51:53 <sgithens> looks fairly straightforward :p
2017-12-01T20:52:00 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2017-12-01T20:52:18 <sgithens> yeah
2017-12-01T20:52:21 <sgithens> it\'s confusing
2017-12-01T20:52:34 <sgithens> I went to look at maybe upgrading the version of infusion I\'m on
2017-12-01T20:52:44 <colinclark> but this needs to be updated if you add other options: https://github.com/colinbdclark/codemirror-infusion/blob/master/src/codemirror-infusion.js#L15-L26
2017-12-01T20:53:06 <colinclark> I\'m not sure why we didn\'t just go with an extra level of containment
2017-12-01T20:53:12 <colinclark> "codemirrorOptions" or whatever
2017-12-01T20:53:23 <sgithens> but... maybe I\'m jsut bad at using npmjs.com but I can\'t actually see the entire list of versions.  LIke, the latest published official is 2.0.0, but I\'m currently using 3.0.0-dev-randomHash, which I don\'t actually see up there
2017-12-01T20:53:29 <colinclark> but this part of the system came from Bosmon\'s original implementation in, I think, Souq
2017-12-01T20:53:32 <colinclark> or math on a sphere
2017-12-01T20:53:33 <colinclark> or something
2017-12-01T20:53:39 <colinclark> oh yes
2017-12-01T20:53:53 <colinclark> there is a command line for that
2017-12-01T20:54:04 <sgithens> I see
2017-12-01T20:54:10 <sgithens> you can\'t actually use a web browser
2017-12-01T20:54:22 <colinclark> npm view infusion versions
2017-12-01T20:54:32 <colinclark> will give you the complete ordered list of all releases of a module
2017-12-01T20:54:42 <sgithens> awesome thanks
2017-12-01T20:54:46 <colinclark> npm\'s web app, perhaps rightly, doesn\'t show dev releases
2017-12-01T20:55:01 <colinclark> so we publish official releases very rarely, and dev releases very often
2017-12-01T20:55:16 <colinclark> because an official release is, like, fully QA tested
2017-12-01T20:55:18 <sgithens> it\'s very wierd, as I usually want a shell command for everything, but it seems pretty messed up to me, that the versions aren\'t listed on the actual npm page
2017-12-01T20:55:18 <colinclark> which takes time
2017-12-01T20:55:26 <colinclark> ha
2017-12-01T20:55:35 <colinclark> well, I think it makes sense, though it\'s not ideal for Infusion
2017-12-01T20:57:52 <sgithens> to not list the releases that your platform is hosting?  I always get the feeling that web pages for node projects are like coffee houses with lots of brushed steel.  The coffee.. is pretty awesome, and everything looks really cool.  But man, would it kill you to leave some cushions for the damn seats.  Brushed steel is not comfortable to sit and be productive on, even though it looks cool and is super super minimalistic
2017-12-01T20:58:01 <sgithens> ok. I\'ll stop ranting now
2017-12-01T20:59:05 <colinclark> hahaha

2017-12-01T12:18:15 <Bosmon> Hi there jhernandez, dandimitrov - do you have everything you need to build the installer?
2017-12-01T12:21:17 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, I already had one
2017-12-01T12:21:35 <jhernandez> I\'ve been testing it and it works pretty well
2017-12-01T12:22:19 <dandimitrov> That\'s great to hear, jhernandez!
2017-12-01T12:22:24 <dandimitrov> :)
2017-12-01T12:22:31 <jhernandez> the only thing, is that I assume we want to build an installer that uses the dev config, at least for this first round of testing
2017-12-01T12:23:13 <jhernandez> I see different behaviors that I don\'t fully understand
2017-12-01T12:23:30 <Bosmon> jhernandez - that\'s right, yes - at least, the config that enables the hardcoded preference hacks that enable testing of "restart required" that dandimitrov has put in
2017-12-01T12:23:36 <Bosmon> What behaviours do you see :)
2017-12-01T12:23:36 <jhernandez> ie, when using the production config, the OSRestart thing doesn\'t appear
2017-12-01T12:23:42 <jhernandez> exactly
2017-12-01T12:23:51 <jhernandez> that thing
2017-12-01T12:23:56 <Bosmon> jhernandez - that\'s correct, yes
2017-12-01T12:24:07 <Bosmon> We don\'t have any preferences in the production set which actually invoke "restart required"
2017-12-01T12:24:18 <jhernandez> yes
2017-12-01T12:25:51 <jhernandez> in any case, I was in the middle of building an installer that uses the dev config - I\'ll pass it to QA when ready
2017-12-01T12:26:05 <Bosmon> jhernandez - awesome!
2017-12-01T12:26:38 <jhernandez> other than that, I could see other things that I don\'t think are that relevant to block QA from beginning the tests
2017-12-01T12:27:15 <jhernandez> ie: when clicking on the tray icon, the PSP panel pops up, re-clicking again must hide the PSP panel, but the panel is still there
2017-12-01T12:27:47 <jhernandez> when logging in with snapset_1, google dictionary settings does not appear in the PSP - which I guess it\'s a matter of checking the metadata
2017-12-01T12:29:05 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, jhernandez: Just to mention one more thing - the dev config also enables the "Key in..." menu item, which allows the user to choose among the different test user tokens
2017-12-01T12:29:11 <jhernandez> yes
2017-12-01T12:29:36 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: and the "quit gpii"
2017-12-01T12:29:56 <jhernandez> which I think it\'s useful at this point
2017-12-01T12:32:39 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-12-01T12:32:51 <Bosmon> Have we added the "snapset 5" to this set of tokens?
2017-12-01T12:35:27 <jhernandez> yes
2017-12-01T12:35:55 <jhernandez> it\'s "Voice control with Increased size", isn\'t it?
2017-12-01T12:38:11 <dandimitrov> jhernandez, yes, that\'s the one. It\'s the first in the list
2017-12-01T12:44:15 * jhernandez nods
2017-12-01T12:44:54 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: awesome job!
2017-12-01T12:46:15 <dandimitrov> :)
2017-12-01T12:57:19 <Bosmon> Really great, guys
2017-12-01T12:57:24 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'m off up North....

2017-12-01T14:05:30 <simonjb> hi there gtirloni
2017-12-01T14:05:39 <gtirloni> hi
2017-12-01T14:06:23 <simonjb> I was chatting with Colin yesterday about doing some work to package up the Nexus and he mentioned that you might be available to help me
2017-12-01T14:07:14 <gtirloni> sure, is that related to the selinux work we did a while ago? or more like Docker containers?
2017-12-01T14:08:29 <simonjb> I think both would be both discussing and other approaches also
2017-12-01T14:08:53 <gtirloni> ok
2017-12-01T14:08:58 <simonjb> would be worth* discussing
2017-12-01T14:09:13 <simonjb> would you have some time on Monday to chat?
2017-12-01T14:09:37 <gtirloni> yes, any time after 10:30AM would be okay for me
2017-12-01T14:10:13 <simonjb> 10:30 your time? can you remind me of our time difference?
2017-12-01T14:12:27 <gtirloni> 10:30 ET... the time difference is 3 hours now (I\'m in GMT-2)
2017-12-01T14:14:13 <simonjb> let\'s do 11:00am ET then -- is that good for you?
2017-12-01T14:14:43 <gtirloni> yep
2017-12-01T14:14:52 <simonjb> awesome, thanks!

2017-12-01T18:35:17 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: good afternoon! Do you know if there is an easy way to add \'checks\' to the transforms applied from common terms, to the payload of a setting handler?
2017-12-01T18:36:19 <javjarfer[m]> for example making sure that a string is N chars long, and where would be a good place to define such transforms?

2017-12-01T20:48:42 <sgithens> colinclark: How is codemirror-infusion these days?  Would it be easy for me to drop in so I can render some json bits in my app?
2017-12-01T20:49:13 <colinclark> sgithens: hi!
2017-12-01T20:49:22 <colinclark> I think it probably should be, yes
2017-12-01T20:49:25 <colinclark> let me have a look
2017-12-01T20:50:12 <colinclark> only issue is that it binds to an older version of Infusion, but that shouldn\'t be a big deal
2017-12-01T20:50:28 <colinclark> as the-t-in-rtf1 can attest, it\'s hard keeping up with Infusion dev releases :)
2017-12-01T20:50:34 <colinclark> it supports JSON5 as well as JSON now
2017-12-01T20:50:37 <colinclark> thanks to Bosmon
2017-12-01T20:50:53 <sgithens> cool.  Is it fairly straight forward to pass in any number of random codemirror options?
