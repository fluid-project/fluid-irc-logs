2017-11-14T21:33:14 <chlorophilia> I must say the architecture looks quite intuitive bosmon, though I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a handle on it yet
2017-11-14T21:36:05 <Bosmon> Hey there chlorophilia
2017-11-14T21:36:20 <chlorophilia> hey
2017-11-14T21:36:58 <chlorophilia> it will take me a while to get back into IRC mode, I keep lapsing on our conversation. lots distracting lately
2017-11-14T21:37:05 <Bosmon> It\'s fine
2017-11-14T21:37:14 <Bosmon> An ear infection and a sleepless baby have been slowing me down a bit
2017-11-14T21:37:19 <chlorophilia> hope you had a good weekend
2017-11-14T21:37:23 <chlorophilia> oh\xe2\x80\x94eeep
2017-11-14T21:37:30 <chlorophilia> yeah, obviously no hurry
2017-11-14T21:37:40 <chlorophilia> although I remain excited :)
2017-11-14T21:37:46 <Bosmon> But I have just managed to render an SVG diagram of about 1000 spp without a giant memory explosion
2017-11-14T21:38:13 <chlorophilia> it will make for a brilliant year-end summation of the project
2017-11-14T21:38:28 <Bosmon> Yes, the extent to which stuff is intuitive or not is a fascinating question
2017-11-14T21:38:30 <chlorophilia> holy wow hahaaha
2017-11-14T21:39:06 <Bosmon> colinclark and I were chatting in a back channel about whether the kinds of values we are interested in will indeed make an atom of difference to the experience of non-specialists
2017-11-14T21:39:11 <Bosmon> Not to say, "amateurs" : P
2017-11-14T21:39:12 <chlorophilia> suggesting that ~3,000 spp would be pushing it
2017-11-14T21:39:33 <colinclark> are you making fun of my "amateur" comment, Bosmon :P
2017-11-14T21:39:34 <colinclark> question mark
2017-11-14T21:39:40 <Bosmon> I think that 3000 will require a bit of finesse to make graceful
2017-11-14T21:39:40 <colinclark> I hope what I said made sense
2017-11-14T21:39:47 <Bosmon> Yes, it really did
2017-11-14T21:39:50 <colinclark> "Amateur" as the person who loves something
2017-11-14T21:39:54 <colinclark> rather than "rookie"
2017-11-14T21:39:56 <Bosmon> I am not making fun at all :)
2017-11-14T21:40:00 <colinclark> ok :)
2017-11-14T21:40:00 <Bosmon> Really just genuinely wondering
2017-11-14T21:40:14 <chlorophilia> i think in the context of the website, the more exciting values might be who found what first when, on hover over perhaps
2017-11-14T21:40:18 <Bosmon> My reworking of this sample is going to be VASTLY, VASTLY more verbose than any of the original samples
2017-11-14T21:40:33 <Bosmon> chlorophilia well sure, the user values are always important
2017-11-14T21:40:38 <chlorophilia> hahaha you mean in lines of code?
2017-11-14T21:40:53 <Bosmon> But in our community we\'re interested in the wider kinds of overlapping values of different communities
2017-11-14T21:41:02 <Bosmon> That is, different communities with different skills and different viewpoints
2017-11-14T21:41:18 <Bosmon> And so, what it means, for example, for a community to "own" an artefact and have some kind of say over its trajectory
2017-11-14T21:41:52 <Bosmon> My personal view is that d3 is a kind of sugar-coated poison pill in this kind of arena, although I would never want to gainsay alanharnum\'s love of it : P
2017-11-14T21:42:11 <chlorophilia> oh hmmmmmmmm
2017-11-14T21:42:22 <Bosmon> But it\'s just so hard to tell what the meaning of one\'s personal views are : P
2017-11-14T21:42:33 <Bosmon> Since they are shaped by so much stuff that you can never hope to factor out
2017-11-14T21:43:05 <chlorophilia> well, it is hard for me to judge, as whatever magic can conjure up an interactive graph of the island biodiversity will seem like\xe2\x80\xa6 magic\xe2\x80\xa6 to me
2017-11-14T21:43:15 <Bosmon> Yeah
2017-11-14T21:43:31 <Bosmon> And this is the kind of awkward phenomenon from which "wizards" derive their power : P
2017-11-14T21:43:44 <Bosmon> If something seemed like magic, then obviously it must have been done by some kind of ... WIZZARDF
2017-11-14T21:43:46 <Bosmon> WIZZARD
2017-11-14T21:44:33 <Bosmon> As I am writing this, it seems absurd that the kinds of values I am interested in will indeed succeed in effacing these distinctions of WIZZARDY
2017-11-14T21:44:49 <Bosmon> Since I\'m sure the code once it is produced, will simply look like some more code to you : P
2017-11-14T21:44:51 <Bosmon> But who knows
2017-11-14T21:45:01 <Bosmon> We are dreamers
2017-11-14T21:45:38 <chlorophilia> hehehehe
2017-11-14T21:46:21 <Bosmon> Even more so in wanting to dream about interfaces that will happily sling around 100,000s of spp without dropping a frame
2017-11-14T21:46:41 <Bosmon> I had a wacky idea last night for generating diagrams like this entirely from inside a WebGL shader
2017-11-14T21:46:45 <Bosmon> But, first things first........
2017-11-14T21:49:52 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-14T21:50:17 <chlorophilia> hehehe, over my head I am afraid
2017-11-14T21:51:23 <Bosmon> So chlorophilia - how did you come to KNOW which are the species endemic to the island, in advance of having laid eyes on them?
2017-11-14T21:51:33 <Bosmon> Did you compile the list from some kinds of "authority"?
2017-11-14T21:51:36 * danayo joined the channel
2017-11-14T21:52:31 <chlorophilia> many of the historical records derived from university / museum herbaria. voucher specimens collected from Galiano Island have been accession at the University of British Columbia, for example, and the Royal BC Museum, among others
2017-11-14T21:52:42 <chlorophilia> accessioned*
2017-11-14T21:52:44 <Bosmon> Wow
2017-11-14T21:52:46 <chlorophilia> blah i can\xe2\x80\x99t grammar today
2017-11-14T21:52:51 <Bosmon> And in what form could you consume these records?
2017-11-14T21:52:55 <chlorophilia> same with the arthropods, lots of collections
2017-11-14T21:53:11 <chlorophilia> xls
2017-11-14T21:53:26 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-14T21:53:30 <chlorophilia> I have also compiled historical lists for the island, inventories of different localities, et
2017-11-14T21:53:31 <chlorophilia> etc
2017-11-14T21:53:35 <Bosmon> That\'s how they curate them themselves?
2017-11-14T21:53:51 <Bosmon> The herbaria, etc...
2017-11-14T21:54:01 <chlorophilia> yeah, they have terribly out-dated systems
2017-11-14T21:54:16 * amatas has quit
2017-11-14T21:54:20 <chlorophilia> UBC at least\xe2\x80\xa6 they\xe2\x80\x99re just now paying someone to try and bring the system into the 21st c
2017-11-14T21:54:30 <Bosmon> Interesting
2017-11-14T21:54:34 <Bosmon> Do you know how they will do that?
2017-11-14T21:54:57 <chlorophilia> last I spoke with one of the curator\xe2\x80\x99s there it was still early on
2017-11-14T21:55:16 <chlorophilia> not sure how far they\xe2\x80\x99ve come
2017-11-14T21:55:30 <chlorophilia> there are a lot of good references, like Australia\xe2\x80\x99s atlas of life
2017-11-14T21:55:41 <chlorophilia> Norway has an excellent lichen herbarium database, too
2017-11-14T21:55:54 <Bosmon> But insofar as they are paying someone
2017-11-14T21:56:02 <Bosmon> What kind of strategy are they hoping to follow?
2017-11-14T21:56:26 <chlorophilia> I am not sure\xe2\x80\xa6 it sounded like there was a lot of work to do training this computer science engineer to think like a biologist
2017-11-14T21:56:52 <chlorophilia> i really only caught a glimpse into their quandry
2017-11-14T21:57:10 <Bosmon> Yes, really fascinating
2017-11-14T21:57:38 <Bosmon> And trying to deal with the countervailing tendency of the computer science engineer to try to get the biologist to think like him :)
2017-11-14T21:57:54 <chlorophilia> the problem as i understand it lies not only in designing a new systsem but figuring out how to scrub the old data and fit it into the new schema, and to create a user-friendly interface whereby people can contribute more records without it being too painful (and it is currently excruciating)
2017-11-14T21:58:29 <Bosmon> Yes, although I imagine that although it is currently excruciating it is probably also somewhat democratic
2017-11-14T21:58:39 <Bosmon> In that it is probably roughly equally excruciating for everybody :)
2017-11-14T21:59:40 <chlorophilia> hehehehe
2017-11-14T22:00:05 <Bosmon> And although I know it sounds a little like I\'m trying to be funny, to a certain extent I\'m not : P
2017-11-14T22:00:07 <chlorophilia> well it is 2pm on a Tuesday and I think i am going to go get some beer. It\xe2\x80\x99s my birthday tomorrow. I am starting early :P
2017-11-14T22:00:19 <Bosmon> Oh wow, fantastic
2017-11-14T22:00:29 <Bosmon> What a fantastic island lifestyle
2017-11-14T22:00:35 <Bosmon> I really do have to try to move there :)
2017-11-14T22:00:40 <Bosmon> And congratulations, btw
2017-11-14T22:01:26 <chlorophilia> the odious thing about contributing specimens to the UBC herbarium is that I have already geo-referenced almost everything via iNaturalist. So I have to go through the process all over. Except iNat has an easy interface. What i usually do is export a csv from iNat and then move as much of the metadata across to the clunky spreadsheet template that UBC uses
2017-11-14T22:02:05 <Bosmon> Ah wow
2017-11-14T22:02:15 <Bosmon> I\'ve just improved my rendering speed by about a factor of 10
2017-11-14T22:02:49 <Bosmon> Yes, I\'m sure eventually tools can arise to make these kinds of clunky processes more graceful
2017-11-14T22:03:05 <Bosmon> Although they aren\'t very glamorous, they are actually the bread and butter of the world....

2017-11-14T16:10:24 <dandimitrov> Hi, Bosmon, I\'ve written an email about the strange tests hanging problem. To whom do you suggest me sending it (probably to fluid-work@fluidproject.org)?
2017-11-14T16:11:44 <jhung> fluid-everyone: planning meeting today will happen at our desks.
2017-11-14T16:11:49 <michelled> simonjb: I need to do something right now, but I think the planning meeting is happening and jhung will run it
2017-11-14T16:12:03 <simonjb> thanks michelled
2017-11-14T16:12:44 <clown> on my way, jhung
2017-11-14T16:13:35 <Bosmon> danayo - either fluid-work or the GPII architecture list, yes
2017-11-14T16:14:16 <danayo> think that was meant for dandimitrov ^

2017-11-14T16:17:43 <javjarfer[m]> > javjarfer[m] - you can just write a grade holding an options distribution in your config
2017-11-14T16:17:44 <javjarfer[m]> I have tried several times to create that grade with no success :(, do you think I could share with you the tries so you can point me out what I\'m doing wrong?

2017-11-14T17:39:21 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: hi! so, this was my (poor) try to combine those grades https://pastebin.com/7Ek1YWz7
2017-11-14T17:40:02 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that\'s pretty crazy
2017-11-14T17:40:13 <Bosmon> The value of "type" isn\'t even a string : P
2017-11-14T17:40:36 <Bosmon> To start with, I think you\'ve misread the JSON containment structure a bit
2017-11-14T17:40:56 <Bosmon> type is a member whose value is a string, and then the other values are held in "options"
2017-11-14T17:40:58 <javjarfer[m]> yep... I thought that will be resolved into the actual grade with that name
2017-11-14T17:41:11 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - "what name"? : P
2017-11-14T17:41:30 <javjarfer[m]> the string inside type
2017-11-14T17:41:34 <Bosmon> I mean, what do you imagine type: { maxTimeOuts : 24} signifies? : P
2017-11-14T17:41:48 <Bosmon> There is no string inside type
2017-11-14T17:41:54 <Bosmon> You have written a JSON structure
2017-11-14T17:42:05 <Bosmon> Which has a key of "maxTimeOuts" and a value of 24
2017-11-14T17:42:21 <Bosmon> I\'m sure if you had written this in Haskell this elementary type blunder would not have been possible :)
2017-11-14T17:42:27 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-11-14T17:44:23 <Bosmon> Here\'s an example from the docs: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html#examples
2017-11-14T17:45:10 <Bosmon> But one of the main principles of Infusion is that definitions like this can be written more compactly and stably using distributions - https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCSS.html#simple-example-of-distributeoptions-record-for-grade-distribution
2017-11-14T17:45:12 <javjarfer[m]> haha yes... I think my misconception was that when I was expecting that the other \'type\' whose string matched the gpii.test.acceptance.exec grade, to be \'unpacked\' into the values of that grade, and then mixed with my \'array type\' with one field named \'maxTimeOuts\' also
2017-11-14T17:45:15 * kavya has quit
2017-11-14T17:45:42 <javjarfer[m]> which now I think was a pretty crazy guess
2017-11-14T17:45:50 <Bosmon> In this case you would like a distribution target of something like {that gpii.test.acceptance.exec}.options.maxTimeouts
2017-11-14T17:45:56 <Bosmon> And a "record" of 24
2017-11-14T17:46:02 <Bosmon> Also note the capitalisation
2017-11-14T17:49:13 <javjarfer[m]> okay, I think I\'m starting to understand the structure, the distributedOptions sounds more deep

2017-11-14T17:52:35 * amatas_ is now known as amatas
2017-11-14T17:54:26 <javjarfer[m]> The point of distributedOptions is that you can target any nested structure inside another grade and modify it?
2017-11-14T17:54:43 <javjarfer[m]> well, combine yourself with it\x0f
2017-11-14T17:55:49 <javjarfer[m]> can\'t this be done using simple grade combining? Or this case is more complex because for that you need to preserve all the combination chain till this point?

2017-11-14T18:08:59 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: doing that means that I will modify the maximum retries for all tests?
2017-11-14T18:10:43 <Bosmon> Only for the test you mix your grade into
2017-11-14T18:11:01 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - you could also express this in a standalone grade, yes
2017-11-14T18:11:16 <javjarfer[m]> I need to learn a lot of that...
2017-11-14T18:11:18 <Bosmon> But since you just want to override a single value, the complexity is pretty similar
2017-11-14T18:12:18 <javjarfer[m]> but then if I do overwrite that single value, I need then to combine the two grades or simply refer to the grade in which I\'m using the distributeOptions block?

2017-11-14T10:33:09 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon stegru , anyone knows how to increase the 5 seconds timer from the acceptance tests\xc2\xbf
2017-11-14T10:34:19 <stegru> i don\'t know what you\'re talking about, javjarfer[m]
2017-11-14T10:34:46 <stegru> what\'s with the "[m]"? is it so we know you\'re male?
2017-11-14T10:35:10 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: haha it\'s because I\'m talking from matrix[m
2017-11-14T10:35:18 <stegru> ah ok
2017-11-14T10:35:46 <javjarfer[m]> the acceptance tests has a predefined number of retries true?
2017-11-14T10:36:22 <stegru> oh, where it waits until a setting has been applied?
2017-11-14T10:36:53 * jhernandez joined the channel
2017-11-14T10:37:05 <stegru> i don\'t know where it would be
2017-11-14T10:38:09 <javjarfer[m]> yes, that is
2017-11-14T10:38:42 <javjarfer[m]> mmm okay, thanks you, I need to increase it for the classicShell case. It really takes long to reload if you ask it to quit and start again very fast
2017-11-14T10:39:08 <javjarfer[m]> it looks like it\'s daemon doesn\'t accepts petitions until certain time has past from last one
2017-11-14T10:39:26 <stegru> oh ok
2017-11-14T10:39:50 <stegru> wouldn\'t that test require classic shell to be installed?
2017-11-14T10:48:52 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-11-14T11:01:40 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the tests don\'t actually fail after 5 seconds
2017-11-14T11:01:45 <Bosmon> They just issue you a warning diagnostic
2017-11-14T11:02:04 <Bosmon> At the moment the framework (GPII) is happy enough to wait indefinitely for a settings promise to resolve
2017-11-14T11:02:11 <Bosmon> Although we should really do something about that

2017-11-14T12:09:26 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I have been trying to combine that grade to pass it with the modified maxTimeouts to the test definition there. But I\'m not having luck, any advice of how should I do that? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/554/files#diff-0a30ca35bcc8ad6fd75f1aad5dd6c88bR61
2017-11-14T12:13:25 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - this isn\'t the right approach for your settings handler
2017-11-14T12:13:43 <Bosmon> For a long time we\'ve had the ability for settings handlers to return promises rather than to force the architecture to poll
2017-11-14T12:14:03 <Bosmon> But also - I don\'t see where you tried to configure maxTimeouts?
2017-11-14T12:17:40 <javjarfer[m]> oh, I see, where can I find a acceptance test example using promises instead of polling? (the maxTimeouts configuration isn\'t pushed, I was testing it because it wasn\'t working)

2017-11-14T12:43:53 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L262
2017-11-14T12:44:57 <Bosmon> Ah javjarfer[m] - so what do you do to trigger the slow operation of the classicShell?
2017-11-14T12:45:03 <Bosmon> And how do you determine when it is done?
2017-11-14T12:49:43 <javjarfer[m]> > javjarfer[m] - here is the mock test definition for an async settings handler
2017-11-14T12:49:44 <javjarfer[m]> Sorry, I don\'t know how to use this in order to modify my current testSpec
2017-11-14T12:50:05 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - does the [m] mean you are on your phone or what? : P
2017-11-14T12:51:09 <javjarfer[m]> > Ah javjarfer[m] - so what do you do to trigger the slow operation of the classicShell?
2017-11-14T12:51:10 <javjarfer[m]> If you simply try to start/stop very fast, the ClassicShell daemon makes you wait to execute the next action you requested it, and that process, including the explorer restart, seems to be very very slow
2017-11-14T12:51:21 <javjarfer[m]> maybe due to an internal timeout it have
2017-11-14T12:51:22 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - how do you start/stop?
2017-11-14T12:51:58 <javjarfer[m]> hahaha that is because I\'m using the Riot matrix client, and sets that [m] in the name by default

2017-11-14T12:52:33 <javjarfer[m]> Calling the application executable and calling it with a parameter "-exit" for making the stop
2017-11-14T12:54:29 <javjarfer[m]> But it looks like when you reload the explorer, that triggers the reload of the thing the embed into it, and there is a timeout until the -exit parameter start taking effect
2017-11-14T12:54:39 <javjarfer[m]> and that time is really long

2017-11-14T14:57:13 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: isn\'t this  a timeout from the tests? Maybe there is a timeout for promises to be resolved? Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 11 of 19 sequence element
2017-11-14T14:58:09 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that is just a warning message as I mentioned above
2017-11-14T14:59:17 <javjarfer[m]> so the only way of failing is the promise being wrongly resolved?
2017-11-14T15:02:46 * georgit has quit
2017-11-14T15:03:46 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I\'m still not clear how your settings handler works, or what precisely you are waiting for
2017-11-14T15:06:30 <cindyli> kasparnet, Bosmon: i\'m working on the local flow manager so that it can request an access token from the cloud then send it along with a PUT request to /untrusted-settings endpoint at the cloud for updating preferences on behalf of PSP. The approach i\'m thinking to use is to provide a set() invoker on the "settingsDataSource" component that is a subcomponent of {flowManager} at the untrusted config: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/un
2017-11-14T15:06:30 <cindyli> iversal/blob/44fb0dc72d2d880ebf07616ac945deb760ee7570/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L30. when preferences is ready to be updated at the cloud, call {flowManager}.settingsDataSource.set(). do you think this approach is ok?
2017-11-14T15:06:44 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-11-14T15:07:09 <cindyli> "settingsDataSource" has a get() invoker for fetching user settings from /untrusted-settings endpoint in my GPII-2538 branch - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2538/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L151
2017-11-14T15:07:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - sounds reasonable, but what happens in the trusted configuration, which is currently the only one we test with?
2017-11-14T15:08:30 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: I don\'t know if you have seen the new refactored version https://github.com/JavierJF/windows/blob/6da36d53f648033411e667a5902b19782d1aae29/gpii/node_modules/processHandling/processHandling.js#L403
2017-11-14T15:08:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: does trusted onfiguration use /settings endpoint at the cloud? if so, it might be going thru another route
2017-11-14T15:09:19 <javjarfer[m]> basically what I\'m doing is executing one command, and waiting for that process to change its state, before relaunching another process
2017-11-14T15:09:43 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - how does this code get invoked?
2017-11-14T15:10:13 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: from the start/stop blocks of the classicShell solution in the SR
2017-11-14T15:11:54 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - ok, I see, here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/554/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R3199 ?
2017-11-14T15:12:13 <Bosmon> And how have you written mocks for these functions?
2017-11-14T15:15:13 <cindyli> Bosmon: according to the readme in kasparnet\'s pull request of how to use pcp channel client, 2 configs are supported:
2017-11-14T15:15:21 <cindyli> 1. gpii.config.development.all.local.mock.windows
2017-11-14T15:15:21 <cindyli> 2. gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.mock.windows
2017-11-14T15:15:48 <cindyli> the option 1 directly interact with the preferences server without going thru a cloud based flow manager
2017-11-14T15:15:59 <cindyli> so it uses APIs provided by the preferences server
2017-11-14T15:16:41 <cindyli> the option 2 uses the untrusted config, which will make use of {settingsDataSource} to interact with the cloud based flow manager
2017-11-14T15:17:41 <cindyli> so, the approach i mentioned above will accommodate the option 2
2017-11-14T15:18:24 <cindyli> let me know if I miss anything

2017-11-14T15:24:36 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: sorry, I don\'t know which kind of mocks should I write, are they necessary for acceptance tests?
2017-11-14T15:30:15 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - the whole purpose of acceptance tests is to test against mocks as well as the real implementation
2017-11-14T15:30:22 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure how your test is currently running if you have not written any mocks
2017-11-14T15:31:16 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t it complain that gpii.windows.closeAfterOpenCommand isn\'t defined when you run your test from universal?
2017-11-14T15:31:40 <Bosmon> Very mysterious
2017-11-14T15:31:53 <Bosmon> perhaps you have set up your pull not to run the acceptance test you have written?
2017-11-14T15:33:18 <Bosmon> Well, I see it is in index-windows.js ...
2017-11-14T15:34:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-11-14T15:34:07 <Bosmon> I wonder how it works
2017-11-14T15:35:12 <Bosmon> If you have written no mock, you should get a fatal error that gpii.windows.closeAfterOpenCommand is undefined
2017-11-14T15:36:07 <javjarfer[m]> yes, I think the pr is currently not running the acceptance tests, you have to run them manually because they have one test failing anyway
2017-11-14T15:36:19 <javjarfer[m]> > If you have written no mock, you should get a fatal error that gpii.windows.closeAfterOpenCommand is undefined
2017-11-14T15:36:20 <javjarfer[m]> I\'m not having this problem...
2017-11-14T15:37:45 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t your acceptance test attempt to run the "start" block for the solution?
2017-11-14T15:39:09 <Bosmon> oh oh oh wow look at this!
2017-11-14T15:39:10 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L197
2017-11-14T15:39:19 <Bosmon> What nut wrote this :)
2017-11-14T15:39:29 <Bosmon> It looks like EVERY action is redirected to the same mock
2017-11-14T15:41:00 <javjarfer[m]> ohh, and that means that the start/stop blocks are automatically called true?
2017-11-14T15:41:23 <Bosmon> Well, they are called, and they just do nothing, in the configuration of the integration test :(
2017-11-14T15:41:28 <Bosmon> I guess we have needed to fix this for years

2017-11-14T15:42:35 <Bosmon> Anyway you are correct that the configuration you have to override is here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Acceptance.js#L35
2017-11-14T15:43:04 <Bosmon> This is the completely unrelated set of functions which manages process observation in acceptance tests
2017-11-14T15:43:14 <Bosmon> I assume we have a JIRA open for "acceptance tests should use the process reporter"
2017-11-14T15:44:02 <Bosmon> Yes, here it is: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1882

2017-11-14T16:00:45 <javjarfer[m]> > Yes, here it is: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1882  [GPII-1882] Modify acceptance testing to use Process Reporter - GPII Issue Tracker Details Type: Bug Status: Open Priority: Major Resolution: Unresolved Affects Version/s: None Fix Version/s:
2017-11-14T16:00:46 <javjarfer[m]> Oh! so how could I change that value to override it and have more \'maxTimeouts\'?
2017-11-14T16:02:46 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - you can just write a grade holding an options distribution in your config
