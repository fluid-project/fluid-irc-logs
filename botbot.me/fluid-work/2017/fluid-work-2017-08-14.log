2017-08-14T14:46:55 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: I'll be missing standup, have a doctor's appointment. Basically I wanted to update Justin_o and jhung -- it seems that I've found those function calls to Themes.styl are indeed being used. The contrast theme options in the preferences panel got buggy each time I changed the theme.
2017-08-14T14:47:42 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks, is the PR ready to reviewed again, or are you still making changes to it.
2017-08-14T14:47:43 <Justin_o> ?
2017-08-14T14:48:19 <grrrero> Justin_o: I'll put those function calls back in again and let you know when that's done
2017-08-14T14:48:26 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks

2017-08-14T17:51:33 <Justin_o> gtirloni: how critical is it to have this fixed https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2524
2017-08-14T17:52:21 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i'm not sure who's using that service right now, can't really say :( i just noticed we were missing it in CI and while i tried to add it, I found that issue... but I haven't received any user feedback about it
2017-08-14T17:52:37 <gtirloni> i'd say low?
2017-08-14T17:52:41 <gtirloni> priority
2017-08-14T17:53:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay thanks, i think i'm going to have to talk to the-t-in-RtF about it. I'm not sure why, but i'm stuck at a point in the tests where a connection is being refused
2017-08-14T17:53:52 <gtirloni> ok, np. thanks for looking at it
2017-08-14T17:55:36 <Justin_o> gtirloni: np, let me know if it comes up in priority, otherwise i'll try to look at it again a bit later
2017-08-14T17:55:43 <gtirloni> will do thx
