2017-11-21T19:09:44 <colinclark> yes
2017-11-21T19:09:45 <alanharnum> on the one hand I really recognize the value in terms of promotion, onboarding, etc to having something like that "one stop shop" targeted at a particularly audience
2017-11-21T19:10:22 <alanharnum> but I also have this hesitation to endorse that model, because there a lot of things wrong with it in terms of cutting off diverse communities that could learn from each other, etc
2017-11-21T19:10:28 <colinclark> For Jutta, I think the important key to the idea of "platform" is just gathering together all our amazing resources and those of our friends and collaborators
2017-11-21T19:10:35 * stegru joined the channel
2017-11-21T19:10:40 <colinclark> I think there need be no more of a "platform" than just that we continue to do that
2017-11-21T19:11:13 <colinclark> the more profound question of platforms involves how we can build out these storytelling tools, share them with people, and make it viable to sustain their use over time
2017-11-21T19:11:26 <danayo> alanharnum: can you say more about why diverse communities can get cut off?
2017-11-21T19:11:40 <danayo> why/how?
2017-11-21T19:11:43 <colinclark> in other words we turn the question of "platform" into "platforms" and engage our partners and communities in making their own

2017-11-21T21:03:54 <clown> thanks stegru, reading it.
2017-11-21T21:10:17 <clown> stegru, I\'m working on something simpler, but I have a question about your first email \xe2\x80\xa6
2017-11-21T21:10:52 <clown> you have a heading "c#:"  with an Invoke function ...
2017-11-21T21:11:46 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6 with a catch clause.  The catch clause invokes jqUnit.fail.  Is this the JavaScript jqUnit we all know an love?

2017-11-21T21:20:12 <clown> I think I get it \xe2\x80\x94 you are using edge\'s ability to make calls back to node?
2017-11-21T21:20:19 <stegru> yes clown
2017-11-21T21:20:20 <clown> Oh, perhaps not. *reads*
2017-11-21T21:20:25 <clown> oh, okay.
2017-11-21T21:20:44 <stegru> jqUnit.assert is the node function
2017-11-21T21:21:07 <clown> as called from C#.  Very clever.
2017-11-21T21:22:01 <clown> I\'ll try that out, thanks.
2017-11-21T21:23:41 <clown> bordering on brilliant, actually.  Good tip, stegru.
2017-11-21T21:23:59 <stegru> :D

2017-11-21T12:18:29 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: yesterday I tried the Linux repo for the first time, but it\'s very broke - is that normal?
2017-11-21T12:18:36 <stegru> sorry, i mean jhernandez
2017-11-21T12:18:47 <stegru> (but you can answer too, jj)
2017-11-21T12:34:01 <jhernandez> stegru: honestly, I haven\'t tested linux for some time
2017-11-21T12:34:10 <jhernandez> but it\'s not a surprise
2017-11-21T12:34:40 <jhernandez> probably I should give it an update

2017-11-21T12:54:54 <stegru> i can\'t remember, but I think the tests where failing
2017-11-21T12:55:06 <stegru> jhernandez: i might have done it wrong
2017-11-21T12:55:23 <jhernandez> mmm, as far as I know, tests are passing
2017-11-21T12:55:50 <jhernandez> and now I remember that a month ago or so I gave it a try and it worked
2017-11-21T12:56:19 <jhernandez> but it\'s true that the universal ref may be a bit out of date
2017-11-21T12:56:59 <jhernandez> in any case, as you said on jira, linux can wait
2017-11-21T12:57:19 <stegru> ok i\'ll do it again now that I know it should be working (and I probably held it wrong)
2017-11-21T12:59:12 <jhernandez> I guess that for the usb one, we should just give a little love to the poc I provided some time ago
2017-11-21T12:59:53 <jhernandez> the rfid user listener doesn\'t live on the linux repo, but I don\'t think this is relevant to you right now
2017-11-21T13:00:01 <jhernandez> let me know if you have any issues
2017-11-21T13:00:54 <stegru> yes, i\'m not going to spend long on it

2017-11-21T15:43:33 <Justin_o> thanks :)
2017-11-21T15:43:40 <Bosmon2> I\'ve assigned you a keyboard-a11y bug as a minor celebration :)
2017-11-21T15:43:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: lol thanks :)
2017-11-21T15:43:56 <Bosmon2> I don\'t think it needs to be tagged unless it goes through some form of release process
2017-11-21T15:45:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: Okay, any suggestion where i should post a build of the extension to be used with testing?
2017-11-21T15:45:55 <Bosmon2> Justin_o - well if it is entering testing, that counts as a release :)
2017-11-21T15:47:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well they\'ll start QA testing next week, and then add it to the pilots afterwards
2017-11-21T15:47:24 <jhernandez> Justin_o: congrats on the merge!
2017-11-21T15:47:31 <jhernandez> very good stuff :)
2017-11-21T15:47:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: perhaps it makes more sense post QA to tag, in case there are any more bugs to address.
2017-11-21T15:47:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, certainly warrants a tag and/or a dev or standard release before you pass it over to QA
2017-11-21T15:47:50 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks :) just continued from your great start

2017-11-21T15:53:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon, jhernandez: Maybe we can chat about it at the architecture meeting tomorrow. Assuming that it\'s still happening. In the meantime I\'ll look into the bug https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2725
2017-11-21T15:53:41 <jhernandez> Justin_o, Bosmon: also, I\'m not sure about the policies/restrictions when publishing extensions in the chrome store but, do you think of any reason why we wouldn\'t want to make it happen?
2017-11-21T15:54:42 <jhernandez> Justin_o: yes, we can talk about it in the arch meeting
2017-11-21T15:56:11 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hmm... good question about publishing it to the store.. the only thing I can think of is that we might rename the repo when we start to expand the browser coverage. that is, we\'d hope to be able to make all of the extensions from the same code base if that\'s actually possible
2017-11-21T15:57:20 <jhernandez> good point
2017-11-21T15:59:14 <jhernandez> in any case, it wouldn\'t hurt if we publish it as it is before we tackle other browsers - but yes, probably we should think about our strategy better before publishing it

2017-11-21T16:01:01 <Justin_o> jhernandez: yep that makes sense.. it would be nice to have it out in the wild :)
