2017-04-05T13:52:36 <amatas> gtirloni: are you able to open https://terms.raisingthefloor.org ?
2017-04-05T13:52:54 <gtirloni> yes
2017-04-05T13:53:13 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2017-04-05T13:54:08 <gtirloni> http://www.websitenotworking.com/terms.raisingthefloor.org
2017-04-05T13:55:03 <amatas> nice site :)
2017-04-05T13:56:05 <gtirloni> amatas: i got the tls cert for link.raisingthefloor.org from it
2017-04-05T13:56:22 <gtirloni> but chrome didn\'t complain
2017-04-05T13:56:54 <gtirloni> ah, ignore this. i see the SAN list. sorry.
2017-04-05T13:57:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I will admit that it was a straightup goof plugging in terms.gpii.net, but our 404 page is not at all helpful.
2017-04-05T13:57:59 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s nginx boilerplate behind an SSL error.
2017-04-05T13:58:47 <gtirloni> :)
2017-04-05T13:59:25 <the-t-in-rtf> http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/terms.gpii.net
2017-04-05T13:59:38 <the-t-in-rtf> So, for example, our page seems to some services like it\'s up.
2017-04-05T13:59:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Because the bogus boilerplate was served up with a 200 code.
2017-04-05T14:00:49 <the-t-in-rtf> It seems like it\'s just terms.gpii.net that\'s borked
2017-04-05T14:00:53 <the-t-in-rtf> bogus.gpii.net has a 404
2017-04-05T14:01:00 <the-t-in-rtf> probably there\'s part of a previous configuration somewhere.
2017-04-05T14:01:30 <gtirloni> amatas: probably the gpii.net catch-all?
2017-04-05T14:02:52 <the-t-in-rtf> not really.
2017-04-05T14:02:57 <the-t-in-rtf> bogus.gpii.net throws a 404
2017-04-05T14:03:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, somewhere it thinks that terms.gpii.net should be handled differently than randomstring.gpii.net
2017-04-05T14:03:34 <gtirloni> bogus.gpii.net doesn\'t even resolve, how can it be throwing a 404 ?
2017-04-05T14:03:45 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, good point.
2017-04-05T14:04:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Probably there\'s just an old hostname entry and it\'s the generic gpii.net "catch all"
2017-04-05T14:04:23 <the-t-in-rtf> but that catch all is not awesome.
2017-04-05T14:04:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, you see the SSL errors, it\'s using qi.gpii.net\'s cert
2017-04-05T14:07:10 <gtirloni> it should be one of the varios SAN\'s (in chrome: F12, security, show certificate, certificate fields -> certificate subject alternative name)
2017-04-05T14:08:27 <gtirloni> amatas: maybe this is where the magic is happening: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ops/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/tor1_gpii_lb#L166-L174

2017-04-05T14:10:02 <amatas> mm, yes, terms.gpii.net doesn\'t point to any backend
2017-04-05T14:10:35 <amatas> even it\'s not included in the domain list of the certificate, that\'s why we get the SSL error
2017-04-05T14:11:02 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: should terms.gpii.net point to terms.raisingthefloor.org?
2017-04-05T14:14:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'d be happy if it just 404ed.
2017-04-05T14:14:21 <the-t-in-rtf> You could just remove the DNS entry IMO.
