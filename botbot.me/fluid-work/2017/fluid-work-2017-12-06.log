2017-12-06T17:57:29 <grrrero> gtirloni: Hi Gio I'm having some problems with vagrant/wordpress on my machine
2017-12-06T17:57:50 <grrrero> It was working fine and it stopped loading, HTTP Error 500
2017-12-06T18:00:07 <gtirloni> hi, you can check for error in the file /var/log/nginx/error.log (i believe)  vagrant ssh -c 'tail /var/log/nginx/error.log'
2017-12-06T18:00:26 <gtirloni> if you haven't changed the php code (which could lead to 500 errors), try restarting the VM too `vagrant reload`
2017-12-06T18:02:40 <grrrero> gtirloni: tail: cannot open \xe2\x80\x98/var/log/nginx/error.log\xe2\x80\x99 for reading: Permission denied
2017-12-06T18:02:47 <grrrero> Tried a reload... same
2017-12-06T18:02:53 <gtirloni> ssh into the box then
2017-12-06T18:02:55 <grrrero> I rolled back any changes I made to PHP
2017-12-06T18:02:55 <gtirloni> `vagrant ssh`
2017-12-06T18:03:09 <gtirloni> become root: sudo -s
2017-12-06T18:03:20 <gtirloni> navigate to the dir: cd /var/log/nginx
2017-12-06T18:03:29 <gtirloni> show the file: cat error.log

2017-12-06T13:28:30 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello
2017-12-06T13:28:46 <kasparnet> so if we completely ignore that GPII just completely destroyed your machine 30 minutes ago, I guess we\'re pretty happy now :)

2017-12-06T13:29:44 <Justin_o> jhernandez: i\'m thinking of pushing up a new version of UIO+. Which should have the name and some other minor changes in place... but it might change the URL to the chrome web store.. is it okay for me to do this now?

2017-12-06T13:31:00 <jhernandez> just let me know, but I guess that the URL shouldn\'t change
2017-12-06T13:31:13 <jhernandez> but let\'s see what happens

2017-12-06T13:33:03 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon9 - I was actually pinging you to see if you were up for a quick meeting regarding implementing support for "liveness" in the core arch and/or componentizing the solutions registry
2017-12-06T13:33:39 <kasparnet> but I see that we have another meeting in 30 mins, so it might just burn our brains out do do a meeting as warmup
2017-12-06T13:33:53 <kasparnet> but I really would like to talk about those topics
2017-12-06T13:34:09 <kasparnet> but perhaps tomorrow morning\'ish is more realistic
2017-12-06T13:48:34 <Bosmon9> kasparnet - what\'s the meeting in 30 mins?

2017-12-06T14:29:06 <Justin_o> alanharnum: have a safe trip.. Also i\'m in the process of publishing an updated version of UIO+ to the chrome web store that has the proper name
2017-12-06T14:32:15 <alanharnum> Justin_o: great - send me the link when available?
2017-12-06T14:32:37 <alanharnum> I am also now joined by mr colinclark who is off hunting for a coffee
2017-12-06T14:33:21 <alanharnum> I\'m really looking forward to demoing the current UIO/GPII on Windows - it\'s really great
2017-12-06T14:33:54 <Justin_o> alanharnum: :) thanks... the update could take an hour, so i\'m still waiting for it to go through, but i\'ll send you the link when i get it.. when do you board?
2017-12-06T14:36:00 <alanharnum> Justin_o: 10:15, but we won\'t be doing formal demos until tomorrow
2017-12-06T14:36:05 <alanharnum> so still time to install an update this evening
2017-12-06T14:36:37 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that\'s good, cause i\'m not sure it will be up before then
2017-12-06T14:37:06 <kasparnet> jhernandez, did the meeting end?
2017-12-06T14:37:10 <jhernandez> kasparnet: yes
2017-12-06T14:37:14 <kasparnet> I got a disconnect and it wont connect me again

2017-12-06T14:49:42 <jhernandez> FYI, gotta leave now, brb in 1 hour
2017-12-06T14:53:09 <Justin_o> jhernandez, alanharnum: A new version of UIO+ has been published to the chrome web store.. again it\'s unlisted so you can only get to it from this url for now https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek
2017-12-06T14:55:21 <amatas> stegru: it seems that filebeat tracks the ACK status of each log line from the server in a registry
2017-12-06T14:55:55 <amatas> so my first guess is that the registry is been erased every time the PC is restored
2017-12-06T14:56:13 <stegru> ah! yes! probably
2017-12-06T14:56:30 <amatas> stegru: where can I find the latest version of the config file of filebeat?

2017-12-06T16:04:08 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru ! Good afternoon
2017-12-06T16:04:32 <stegru> hi javjarfer[m]
2017-12-06T16:06:25 <javjarfer[m]> hi, would you think that will be better to call something from FFI at which I need to pass a memory buffer? or maybe make the call simpler through edje.js?
2017-12-06T16:08:35 <stegru> what\'s the function you\'re using?
2017-12-06T16:09:07 <javjarfer[m]> postMessageW,  but with string in the lparam
2017-12-06T16:10:31 <mrtyler> are we having the apcp weekly / production readiness meeting?
2017-12-06T16:10:32 <stegru> i don\'t think you can pass buffers with PostMEssage - because it returns immediately, and by the time the recipient of the message receives it the buffer will be gone
2017-12-06T16:11:39 <stegru> i don\'t have anything in my calendar, mrtyler
2017-12-06T16:12:00 <mrtyler> neat, it\'s gone
2017-12-06T16:12:32 <javjarfer[m]> > neat, it\'s gone
2017-12-06T16:12:32 <mrtyler> maybe someone solved all the problems and didn\'t tell me :D
2017-12-06T16:12:34 <javjarfer[m]> yeah it\'s gone

2017-12-06T16:13:51 <stegru> msdn: If you send a message in the range below WM_USER to the asynchronous message functions (PostMessage, SendNotifyMessage, and SendMessageCallback), its message parameters cannot include pointers. Otherwise, the operation will fail. The functions will return before the receiving thread has had a chance to process the message and the sender will free the memory before it is used.
2017-12-06T16:15:24 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I\'m just seeing your comments on the prs, will update them
2017-12-06T16:15:45 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: you can use sendmessage, but send it in another thread, like this: kernel32.SendMessage.async(wnd, msg, wp, lp, function(err,result){});
2017-12-06T16:16:47 <javjarfer[m]> > msdn: If you send a message in the range below WM\\_USER to the asynchronous message functions (PostMessage, SendNotifyMessage, and SendMessageCallback), its message parameters cannot include pointers.

2017-12-06T16:16:48 <javjarfer[m]> stegru : I see, well I was using sendNotifyMessage imported with a string in the third parameter
2017-12-06T16:17:01 <javjarfer[m]> (from powershell) and that was working
2017-12-06T16:17:21 <javjarfer[m]> > thx for the confirmation steve, jj
2017-12-06T16:17:22 <javjarfer[m]> yw!
2017-12-06T16:17:53 <stegru> ok, maybe it\'s ok then - or maybe the buffer wasn\'t freed
2017-12-06T16:18:59 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: yes... I was thinking that maybe Ms runtime takes care of not freeing it before it\'s not needed
2017-12-06T16:19:21 <javjarfer[m]> maybe it\'s better then trying to use edje.js
2017-12-06T16:19:25 <stegru> maybe, who knows
2017-12-06T16:19:33 <javjarfer[m]> and keep that inside the Microsoft runtime
2017-12-06T16:21:42 <stegru> in FFI, make a call to windows.stringToWideChar to get the "pointer"
2017-12-06T16:23:01 <javjarfer[m]> yes, I was reading about that, but then you think it\'s better trying to do it in plain FFI??
2017-12-06T16:23:20 <stegru> yes
2017-12-06T16:23:46 <stegru> in C#, it does the same thing as FFI anyway
2017-12-06T16:23:47 <javjarfer[m]> okay, I will continue how I was doing it then, thanks!
2017-12-06T16:24:24 <javjarfer[m]> > in C#, it does the same thing as FFI anyway
2017-12-06T16:24:25 <javjarfer[m]> but you can do that trick that you showed up to me last time, of importing pointers as \'strings\'
2017-12-06T16:24:34 <javjarfer[m]> I don\'t know how GC is going to handle that
2017-12-06T16:25:46 <stegru> yes, if you define the lParam argument as "char*"
2017-12-06T16:26:58 <javjarfer[m]> I defined it in powershell as \'string\'
2017-12-06T16:27:17 <stegru> char* is a string, in C
2017-12-06T16:27:34 <stegru> (well, a pointer to a char)
2017-12-06T16:27:57 <javjarfer[m]> hahaha know it, but char* doesn\'t have any GC considerations, any \'String\' type, usually does
2017-12-06T16:28:51 <stegru> that\'s handled by FFI
2017-12-06T16:30:27 <javjarfer[m]> yes, well, if as you say it\'s equivalent to a plain type then I will continue with the plain FFI
2017-12-06T16:30:32 <javjarfer[m]> from JS
2017-12-06T16:31:02 <stegru> here\'s an example: https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/GPII-2338/service/src/winapi.js#L296
2017-12-06T16:34:20 <stegru> windows.stringtToWideChar returns an FFI buffer which is passed to the function - when the buffer is no longer referenced (like, out of scope) then it\'s ready for the GC
2017-12-06T16:34:32 <stegru> it\'s all done for you
2017-12-06T16:35:50 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-12-06T16:38:19 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: thanks for the example. I was not really worried about that, I was worried that the MS runtime take into account more than the reference of the local variable, but also where the message itself isn\'t going to be accessed more
2017-12-06T16:39:14 <stegru> no, the MS runtime takes a copy of it and handles it separately, so it can be passed to a different process
2017-12-06T16:39:27 <javjarfer[m]> well, \'the buffer that you are passing referenced in the message\'
2017-12-06T16:39:43 <javjarfer[m]> > no, the MS runtime takes a copy of it and handles it separately, so it can be passed to a different process
2017-12-06T16:39:44 <javjarfer[m]> nice
2017-12-06T16:39:49 <javjarfer[m]> then all solved, doing it that way
2017-12-06T16:39:58 <stegru> yes
2017-12-06T16:40:14 <stegru> as long as it\'s a standard WM_* message

2017-12-06T10:21:59 <kasparnet> jhernandez, Bosmon hey dudes
2017-12-06T10:29:26 <jhernandez> kasparnet: bonjour
2017-12-06T10:29:44 <jhernandez> I was commenting on some JIRAs
2017-12-06T10:31:08 <jhernandez> kasparnet: yesterday night I tested your workaround on the highContrast settings and I now I can turn highcontrast on and off but changes on the theme don\'t get applied
2017-12-06T10:31:37 <kasparnet> yeah, I just saw that in my inbox
2017-12-06T10:31:47 <kasparnet> about to commit a somewhat cleaner fix
2017-12-06T10:31:58 <kasparnet> and after that I\'ll double check contrast theme
2017-12-06T10:32:05 <kasparnet> though I\'m sure it worked for me yesterday
2017-12-06T10:37:34 * stegru has quit
2017-12-06T10:39:57 <jhernandez> kasparnet: in my case, when using snapset_2a, it\'s windows built-in highcontrast themes what is not working
2017-12-06T10:40:24 <jhernandez> UIO+ reacts to both highContrast enabled and highContrast themes changes
2017-12-06T10:41:21 <jhernandez> let me check if I can see anything in the logs ...
2017-12-06T10:44:31 <jhernandez> looks like the PSP is triggering changes when selecting different highContrast themes, but not sure about the exact payload
2017-12-06T10:46:50 <kasparnet> hmm... just tested it here and things are working just fine
2017-12-06T10:47:12 <kasparnet> actually, that was with 2c... sec
2017-12-06T10:48:17 * amatas joined the channel
2017-12-06T10:48:18 <kasparnet> jhernandez, yeah, it\'s working just fine for me
2017-12-06T10:48:33 <kasparnet> could you try and update GPII-2739 from my repo and test it again
2017-12-06T10:50:03 <kasparnet> jhernandez, dandimitrov_: I found a somewhat serious issue that I can reproduce consistently - hope it\'s just on my machine
2017-12-06T10:50:14 <kasparnet> but starting the gpii-app
2017-12-06T10:50:24 <kasparnet> (via the command line)
2017-12-06T10:50:38 <kasparnet> (2) log in via the browser with eg. snapset_2c
2017-12-06T10:50:49 <kasparnet> (3) click the PSP
2017-12-06T10:50:55 <kasparnet> it shows no user being logged in
2017-12-06T10:51:24 <kasparnet> as far as i can tell, it\'s important that you haven\'t moused over or clicked the GPII tasktray or load-thingy at any point before the user has been logged in
2017-12-06T10:52:16 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: What exactly does "(2) log in via the browser with eg. snapset_2c" mean?
2017-12-06T10:52:30 <georgitodorov> Are you not using the PSP to key in?
2017-12-06T10:52:37 <kasparnet> nope
2017-12-06T10:52:49 <kasparnet> I type in "http://localhost:8081/user/snapset_2a/login" in the browser
2017-12-06T10:53:29 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I think you meant (3) *Right* click the PSP
2017-12-06T10:53:41 <jhernandez> in any case, it reports current logged in user
2017-12-06T10:53:44 <kasparnet> so (importantly) my mouse never gets close to anything PSP related until I actually click the task tray when the user is logged in
2017-12-06T10:54:00 <kasparnet> nope, left clicking
2017-12-06T10:54:04 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: Is the PSP expected to work this way? I don\'t know if cookies (or whatever is used to identify that the user has keyed-in) is shared between the PSP BrowserWindow and an actual OS browser.
2017-12-06T10:54:12 <kasparnet> I see the not keyed in screen
2017-12-06T10:55:05 <kasparnet> georgitodorov, the URL login is just an alternative to the RFID reader or USB stick -- both of these actaully result in a http call to that URL
2017-12-06T10:56:09 <jhernandez> kasparnet: ok, I can\'t reproduce the issue here
2017-12-06T10:56:23 <georgitodorov> Let me just check here, too
2017-12-06T10:58:24 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: What happens on my machine when I go to that URL is that the PSP loading icon pops up, the tray icon changes to the keyed-in state and when I open the PSP I see the settings for the snapset
2017-12-06T10:58:42 * kasparnet_ joined the channel
2017-12-06T10:58:44 <jhernandez> kasparnet: re. GPII-2739, just pulled your update - I\'ll test it right away
2017-12-06T10:58:48 <georgitodorov> In short, I can\'t reproduce it either
2017-12-06T10:59:44 <kasparnet> hmmm... weird, and this is immediately after starting the GPII? It seems once any PSP related item has been moused over or clicked things are working fine
2017-12-06T10:59:50 <kasparnet> jhernandez, georgitodorov ^
2017-12-06T11:00:11 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: Yes, I was very careful not to mouse over the tray icon
2017-12-06T11:01:19 <kasparnet> ok - well, glad to hear that... I\'ll do a bit of triaging to see if I can figure out why it happens here, but it\'s great that it\'s not a general bug
2017-12-06T11:01:19 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I\'m actually re-npm installing - will try again and pay attention to not make anything over the tray
2017-12-06T11:01:32 <kasparnet> thanks for checking georgitodorov, jhernandez
2017-12-06T11:02:59 <jhernandez> btw, I\'ve put everything together in personal branches
2017-12-06T11:05:25 <jhernandez> you can use my windows/psp-061217 branch (that points to my universal/psp-061217 one)
2017-12-06T11:05:58 <kasparnet> jhernandez, georgitodorov: though it\'s perhaps not a real bug I\'ve created an issue here https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2747
2017-12-06T11:06:20 <kasparnet> jhernandez, so I\'d edit my gpii-app to reference that from package.json?
2017-12-06T11:06:29 <jhernandez> kasparnet: right
2017-12-06T11:06:43 <kasparnet> cool
2017-12-06T11:07:24 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I\'ve just updated universal\'s to include your last changes on GPII-2739
2017-12-06T11:09:43 <jhernandez> ok, I added the issue you are experiencing to the document
2017-12-06T11:15:04 <jhernandez> kasparnet: just re-tested, I still can\'t make the highContrastTheme to change
2017-12-06T11:15:07 <kasparnet> well, I\'m not sure if it is an issue... it might just be me who screwed something up
2017-12-06T11:15:20 <kasparnet> hmmm... can you paste a log somewhere?
2017-12-06T11:15:37 <jhernandez> sure
2017-12-06T11:15:54 <jhernandez> hold a sec
2017-12-06T11:15:58 <kasparnet> also - when updating a reference for windows from GPII-app - what do you run to actually fetch and build it without things exploding
2017-12-06T11:16:04 <kasparnet> do you run the ps scripts?
2017-12-06T11:16:12 <kasparnet> or does a simple npm install work for you?
2017-12-06T11:16:14 <kasparnet> jhernandez,
2017-12-06T11:16:45 <jhernandez> I always remove the node_modules folder and just run npm install
2017-12-06T11:20:41 <jhernandez> kasparnet: https://pastebin.com/RsXXgLkR
2017-12-06T11:27:50 * dandimitrov_ is now known as dandimitrov
2017-12-06T11:28:43 <kasparnet> jhernandez, ok, so both able to reporduce my not-keyed in issue and change the contrast theme with your branch
2017-12-06T11:28:48 <kasparnet> checking your log now
2017-12-06T11:37:20 <dandimitrov> kasparnet, I also wasn\'t able to reproduce this issue (GPII-2747). Logging in from the browser is reflected in the PSP
2017-12-06T11:39:51 <kasparnet> dandimitrov, i wasn\'t really expecting the issue being related to the browser, but rather something about something along the lines of a lazy-loading of the PSP or the like... but I think we can pretty much write it down as a curiousity on my VM for now since neither of you have been able to reproduce
2017-12-06T11:39:57 <kasparnet> thanks dandimitrov
2017-12-06T11:40:11 <kasparnet> jhernandez, hmmm.. everything looks just fine (and similar to my logs)
2017-12-06T11:41:18 <jhernandez> kasparnet: interesting (and disappointing at the same time) xDDDD
2017-12-06T11:41:23 <kasparnet> jhernandez, does the theme work when selecting from the ease of access menu?
2017-12-06T11:41:32 <jhernandez> kasparnet: hm, good question
2017-12-06T11:41:35 <jhernandez> let me try
2017-12-06T11:41:46 <kasparnet> it\'s the "High Contrast #1" theme
2017-12-06T11:42:23 * kasparnet_ has quit
2017-12-06T11:43:23 <kasparnet> dont worry, that was the fake kasparnet... I\'m still here
2017-12-06T11:45:54 * Bosmon9 joined the channel
2017-12-06T11:46:31 <jhernandez> mmm, I made the gpii to crash when playing around with highContrast themes from both PSP and Windows\' settings
2017-12-06T11:46:41 <jhernandez> this is becoming more interesting ....
2017-12-06T11:46:46 <jhernandez> :S
2017-12-06T11:50:00 <jhernandez> I can\'t reproduce the same thing again, let\'s sweep it under the rug for now ....
2017-12-06T11:51:21 <kasparnet> so changing themes now work?
2017-12-06T11:54:29 <kasparnet> jhernandez, ^
2017-12-06T11:55:51 <jhernandez> nope
2017-12-06T11:56:07 <jhernandez> it uses the last one I used
2017-12-06T11:56:40 <jhernandez> not sure if it has to do with custom themes as we experienced back in cloud4all times
2017-12-06T11:59:36 <jhernandez> okay, now I can\'t key out :/
2017-12-06T12:00:43 <jhernandez> I\'m manually restoring to defaults and will restart the vm just in case ... also, I will test this version in a different set up
2017-12-06T12:01:39 <jhernandez> {"isError":true,"message":"Error occurred during logout: undefined"}
2017-12-06T12:01:45 <kasparnet> wow

2017-12-06T12:10:26 <kasparnet> it\'s just unable to write elf to the registry
2017-12-06T12:11:28 <jhernandez> xDDD
2017-12-06T12:12:21 <jhernandez> I screwed up that vm - I can\'t even manually change the high contrast theme through windows\' settings
