2017-09-18T19:10:58 <Justin_o> michelled, grrrero: I found an issue in FLUID-5534. When the panelIndex is persisted, it doesn\'t properly apply to panels. You can see this by opening UIO in the responsive mode, changing to one of the adjusters. After this reload the page.
2017-09-18T19:11:54 <Justin_o> When UIO is reopened, it should be on the panel that was last there. However, this doesn\'t happen and it appears to be because the the modelListener is being triggered before the adjuster panels have been rendered. So the calculations of the width are off

2017-09-18T19:38:30 <michelled> hi kavya
2017-09-18T19:38:46 <grrrero> michelled: Yep checking it out now
2017-09-18T19:39:06 <michelled> cool
2017-09-18T19:39:41 <kavya> I want to check with you if i can see how spinner looks when someone keyed in - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2401
2017-09-18T19:42:23 <michelled> kavya: do you mean the branch I made? or what\'s already in the hst branch?
2017-09-18T19:44:27 <kavya> i mean the new changes which you refered in last comment
2017-09-18T19:45:36 <michelled> kavya: I committed it to this branch: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/commits/GPII-2401
2017-09-18T19:47:03 <michelled> is that enough for you to see it kavya?
2017-09-18T19:47:13 <kavya> ok... so what should be the behavior of spinner now when someone is keyed in?
2017-09-18T19:47:46 <michelled> well, I changed it to reposition as the screen resolution changes, but I think it looks terrible
2017-09-18T19:48:08 <michelled> I think we should just centre it, but I haven\'t heard back from Bern or anyone on the UX team as to what they think
2017-09-18T19:48:51 <michelled> have you heard from them?

2017-09-18T19:50:36 <michelled> thx!
2017-09-18T19:51:52 <kavya> i also want to know how would i test "exit gpii" in dev mode
2017-09-18T19:51:55 <kavya> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2514
2017-09-18T19:52:35 <grrrero> michelled: Have to leave earlier than expected -- pick up again tomorrow?
2017-09-18T19:53:09 <michelled> grrrero: sure
2017-09-18T19:55:39 <michelled> kavya: I think you should wait for this https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/17 to go in
2017-09-18T19:56:00 <michelled> and then you can easily run in dev mode and you will see an \'exit\' in the menu from the task tray icon

2017-09-18T10:23:48 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov in case you missed it my PCP API branch is updated to current universal master and fully passing
2017-09-18T10:23:54 <Bosmon> You should find it a bit easier to work with
2017-09-18T10:40:15 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I noticed that and updated it on my end, as well. Thank you!
2017-09-18T10:40:39 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - let me know if the payloads for some snapsets don\'t look as you expect
2017-09-18T10:40:52 <Bosmon> I\'ll be working through them during the afternoon

2017-09-18T12:16:15 <georgitodorov> Bosmon - For all snapsets listed at https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/preferences we have the appropriate metadata for the corresponding preferences. The only exception is "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.windows.screenDPI" for which we do not have a user which has this preference. Furthermore, this is a compound preference - it is an object of
2017-09-18T12:16:16 <georgitodorov> preferences (even though in this case there is simply one preference in it). We need to figure out how to interpret such compound settings.
2017-09-18T12:17:31 <georgitodorov> On a call last week we agreed to ignore them for now. However, as the screenDPI has to be supported, the PCP will have to know how to display such compound preferences.
2017-09-18T12:18:51 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-09-18T12:18:54 <georgitodorov> Some users (Alice, Davey, David, Elaine, Elmer) have payloads which contain only compound settings and thus the PCP currently displays nothing for them.
2017-09-18T12:21:04 <georgitodorov> Some users (Manuel and Vladimir) have single-value settings which have an empty commonTerms object definition (such as http://registry.gpii.net/common/matchMakerType, http://registry.gpii.net/common/foregroundColor, http://registry.gpii.net/common/backgroundColor, http://registry.gpii.net/common/fontFaceFontName, http://registry.gpii.net/common/fontFaceGenericFontFace).
2017-09-18T12:22:19 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-09-18T12:30:08 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov - screenDPI is not really a compound setting, this is just the format which application-specific preferences are transmitted in
2017-09-18T12:30:29 <Bosmon> In this case, you are meant to look in the solutions registry entry which contains the schema for any supported individual settings, for example here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/549/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R2563
2017-09-18T12:31:21 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - do you know if any of the named preference users (as opposed to snapsets) are going to see any use in the pilots?
2017-09-18T12:31:29 <Bosmon> I imagine those are currently just used for our internal testing, right?
2017-09-18T12:31:37 <Bosmon> I think you made some updates to "elmer" recently ....
2017-09-18T12:32:05 <kasparne_> yes, afaik! But some are regularly used for demoing
2017-09-18T12:32:11 <kasparne_> (like "elmerv"
2017-09-18T12:32:13 <kasparne_> )*
2017-09-18T12:34:24 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: So, for al application settings we should dive into solutionsReistryEntry.<application_name>.settingsHandlers.configuration.supportedSettings and look for each preference and its corresponding schema?
2017-09-18T12:38:05 <georgitodorov> Also, are you working on the schemas for the rest of the settings (those which are not present in the snapsets)? And in general how do you document that certain functionalities need not be ready for an upcoming pilot?
2017-09-18T12:56:32 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - first question - answer is yes

2017-09-18T13:43:11 <kasparne_> hey Bosmon
2017-09-18T13:44:04 <kasparne_> I found a pretty obscure bug in the modeltransformation framework
2017-09-18T13:44:11 <kasparne_> for collecting input paths
2017-09-18T13:45:00 <kasparne_> basically, when having a nested complex transform (such as the valueMapper) it destroys the array holding the input paths
2017-09-18T13:46:55 <kasparne_> so as you can see here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L404 , in most cases we just pass around the array of input paths and expect that reference to hold when modifying the content
2017-09-18T13:47:28 <kasparne_> which is all fine and dandy until one of these https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L413 fuckers come along
2017-09-18T13:48:31 <kasparne_> apparently Array.concat returns a new array, which means that our previous inputPath array reference suddenly is no longer linked to the transformer object
2017-09-18T13:49:09 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - terrible
2017-09-18T13:49:21 <kasparne_> anyway - reason for the ping is that I\'m not sure whether the best fix would be to avoid passing the array reference around, or if it\'d be better practice to change the concat call
2017-09-18T13:54:39 <kasparne_> "avoid passing around the reference you silly bastard, that\'s way too brittle"
2017-09-18T13:54:44 <kasparne_> okey dokey chief
2017-09-18T13:54:59 <michelled> Bosmon, kasparne_, jhernandez: anyone want to merge this now? https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/17
2017-09-18T13:56:17 <kasparne_> michelle: Are those working tests?
2017-09-18T13:56:20 <kasparne_> weeee
2017-09-18T13:58:14 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - sure, do fix the issue, by whatever means strike you as decent and appropriate :)
2017-09-18T13:58:26 <kasparne_> Bosmon: coolio! Cheers
2017-09-18T13:59:34 <kasparne_> Bosmon: I\'ll add a fix for this, and make a pull request for the universal common terms filtering tomorrow
