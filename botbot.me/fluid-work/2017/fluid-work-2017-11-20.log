2017-11-20T15:54:46 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark, I think i\'ve done what is needed for supporting PSP with GPII existing data model. it includes:
2017-11-20T15:54:46 <cindyli> 1. secured /untrusted-settings and modified the local flow manager to use the secured endpoint
2017-11-20T15:54:47 <cindyli> 2. added the support of updating preferences via POST at /untrusted-settings and provided an API at the local flow manager so that PSP client can use to interact with GPII cloud
2017-11-20T15:54:47 <cindyli> 3. removed oauth support for web preferences consumers and first discovery tool
2017-11-20T15:54:47 <cindyli> The next step I\'m thinking to work on is to implement the new data model that we discussed @ https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences#Data_Model
2017-11-20T15:54:47 <cindyli> Before I start, I\'d like to check if there are other tasks that have higher priority you\'d like me to work on?

2017-11-20T16:24:46 <colinclark> thanks for all the work you\'ve done so far
2017-11-20T16:25:05 <cindyli> great. thanks, colinclark
2017-11-20T16:30:14 <cindyli> colinclark, simonjb, Bosmon, In terms of the implementation of the new data model(https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences#Data_Model), I\'m thinking to leave out the in-question gpiiAppInstallation.userId field, which has a question mark besides. whether this field should be "userId" or "prefsSafeId" would be clearer when the UX team gets back on the workflow about how an installing person can request a client credent
2017-11-20T16:30:14 <cindyli> ial for a GPII app installation. fyi, the suggested 3 workflows are described at https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Workflows_to_Request_and_Manage_Client_Credentials and we discussed it with the UX team in August. do you think it makes sense?

2017-11-20T16:35:09 <jhung> grrrero: can we sync up tomorrow afternoon on the Snow site? I\'d like to see how you\'ve managed so far, and how we can improve the parent theme (which I haven\'t refactored yet).
2017-11-20T16:35:39 <grrrero> Ok sure jhung

2017-11-20T17:55:30 <Bosmon> Hey there Justin_o - just checking out the extension now
2017-11-20T17:55:33 <Bosmon> It\'s looking really great
2017-11-20T17:55:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2017-11-20T17:56:01 <Bosmon> I\'m wondering, did UX really specify it without any of the state framing controls like "Save" "Reset" etc?
2017-11-20T17:56:08 <Bosmon> I guess those are arriving as part of an upcoming work package?
2017-11-20T17:57:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m trying to remember, possibly for save as that\'s not something that we currently do.. that is, we don\'t write pack to a users preference set
2017-11-20T17:57:36 <Justin_o> i don\'t recall off hand if i talked to them about reset
2017-11-20T17:59:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t see anything about save or reset on the wiki page https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Browser_Extensions
2017-11-20T18:00:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can\'t find anything on save or reset in UIO+
2017-11-20T18:01:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, pretty interesting
2017-11-20T18:01:19 <Bosmon> I imagine it will be one of the very first pieces of feedback that come back from user testing :)
2017-11-20T18:01:30 <Bosmon> But at least we will be able to celebrate the transition to user-led design
2017-11-20T18:01:41 <Bosmon> I think other than just adding a placeholder JIRA for that build issue this is ready to go in
2017-11-20T18:02:24 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-11-20T18:12:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: YEAH!!! okay, i\'ll spend some time looking into that issue and filing a JIRA with the relevant details as needed. I\'ll ping you back after I\'ve done that.
2017-11-20T18:17:40 <gmoss> simonjb: if you have any time this afternoon to take a look at my code, I\'m free until 2:00 and then back again around 3:00. :)

2017-11-20T18:56:22 <gmoss> it\'s (hopefully) not a complicated case
2017-11-20T18:56:32 <gmoss> but I\'m totally fine to wait until after

2017-11-20T19:35:01 <Justin_o> gtirloni: looks like the tests failed, but it says Firefox 49.. shouldn\'t that be Firefox 57 now
2017-11-20T19:37:50 <Justin_o> sorry, i was looking at the wrong output.. looks like the debounce test failed
2017-11-20T19:38:00 <Justin_o> i wonder if it\'s a timing issue in CI?
2017-11-20T19:38:12 <Justin_o> it passed when i ran it locally using testem and the vagrant vm
2017-11-20T19:39:39 <gtirloni> yep, same here.. worked fine multiple times. i triggered another build.. i also suspect a time issue because the very first test failed
2017-11-20T19:42:43 <gtirloni> s/time/timing
2017-11-20T19:44:10 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay.. let me know if there is anything i can help with

2017-11-20T20:03:30 <Justin_o> avtar:  you can see them by running this npm command "npm show infusion versions"
2017-11-20T20:03:46 <Justin_o> it will show all of the npm versions.. but most of them are dev releases
2017-11-20T20:05:05 <avtar> perfect thanks!

2017-11-20T20:50:37 <gtirloni> Justin_o: updated nodejs on the jenkins build node from 6.x to 8.x and it now works... go figure. nodejs is already 8.x inside the VM. maybe it\'s a timing issue after all
2017-11-20T20:51:48 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for fixing that.. strange, i wouldn\'t have thought it would be related to the node version..
2017-11-20T20:52:56 <gtirloni> yeah, i\'m not sure. the host\'s nodejs is used but only for invoking grunt, which then invokes vagrant and nodejs inside the VM... i figured that was one difference from my local setup. i\'ll run the job a few times to confirm it\'s really working
