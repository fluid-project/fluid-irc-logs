2017-06-16T15:38:35 <alanharnum> clown: http://www.word-wizard.com/wp-content/themes/wordwizard-theme/images/logo-word_wizard.jpg
2017-06-16T15:41:49 <clown> fluid-everyone:  looking for an ms office wizard who knows the lingo.  One of our documents (may) have improper heading numbering.  I\'ve been advised to do a "SVP  check".
2017-06-16T15:42:02 <clown> anyone know what "SVP" means?
2017-06-16T15:42:36 <clown> I\'ve found around two dozen meanings for that acronym, none of which seem to apply.
2017-06-16T15:43:23 <Justin_o> clown: no idea, maybe there was a typo there?
2017-06-16T15:44:24 * stegru has quit
2017-06-16T15:44:31 <cindyli> some sort of validation?
2017-06-16T15:46:14 <clown> Justin_o:  no typo.  Each heading has a numbering, e.g., "A.1" "A.1.1" "A.1.2", and so on.  The commenter thinks the nesting is out of whack.
2017-06-16T15:49:23 <Justin_o> clown: sorry, don\'t think i can help. I looked around word a bit, but couldn\'t find anything that seemed related
2017-06-16T15:50:33 <gtirloni> clown: where\'s the commenter from?
2017-06-16T15:50:39 * colinclark has quit
2017-06-16T15:51:32 <clown> gtirloni:  not sure as I only know her by name, but she has worked with the ISO, and knows their document formats.
2017-06-16T15:51:59 <gtirloni> i\'ve usually seen "svp" as an abbreviation for "s\xe2\x80\x99il vous pla\xc3\xaet" ("please")
2017-06-16T15:52:06 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-06-16T15:53:01 <clown> gtirloni:  yeah, the might be it.  The exact quote is "Something seems to be askew with the numbering. I have A.1 (1.1.1 - 1.1.5) and A.1. 2 (1.2.1-1.2.11). Can you SVP check, and add the sub-titles to the Table of Contents."
2017-06-16T15:53:15 <clown> it might be that simple.
2017-06-16T15:53:44 <gtirloni> a bit odd in a english sentence but.. habits sometimes :)
2017-06-16T15:54:07 <alanharnum> colinclark michelled: got the platform.coop site running locally in Docker, yay
2017-06-16T15:54:13 <colinclark> oh wow
2017-06-16T15:54:17 <colinclark> amazing, alanharnum
2017-06-16T15:55:48 <michelled> great!
2017-06-16T16:05:12 <clown> michelled: something I forgot to say at standup:  given the priority of the NWI and CD1, I\'m putting the Risk assessment document at the bottom of the pile (a pile of 3).
2017-06-16T16:05:25 <clown> I\'ll return to it Tue next week.
2017-06-16T16:09:13 <michelled> thx clown

2017-06-16T16:41:19 <alanharnum> colinclark michelled: OK, I don\'t think this will be too hard
2017-06-16T16:41:46 <michelled> that\'s good to hear
2017-06-16T16:41:53 <michelled> do you think you need the plugin?
2017-06-16T16:41:57 <alanharnum> as I suspected there\'s a tag syntax that lets you do combinations of custom content taxonomy fields when building entries - the implementation currently is using a feature that automatically extracts taxonomy from the URL
2017-06-16T16:42:02 <alanharnum> michelled: no, I don\'t think so
2017-06-16T16:42:24 <alanharnum> but that automatic taxonomy feature is limited to single tags
2017-06-16T16:42:57 <alanharnum> there\'s a more complicated syntax you could use to do something like the following... given the URL \'/resources/tags/platform-capitalism/uber\', get all entries tagged both \'uber\' and \'platform capitalism\'
2017-06-16T16:43:46 <alanharnum> which is what Trebor was describing
2017-06-16T16:44:51 <alanharnum> the tag syntax is a lot like Movable Type, which I\'ve worked with a lot
2017-06-16T16:45:11 <alanharnum> I\'m going to do some more exploration but I can much more easily make a ballpark estimate on this now

2017-06-16T18:38:45 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli - would you be able to take a look at https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/518 which is a dependency update to take in the Kettle features required for GPII-2176 requested by gtirloni_ ?
2017-06-16T18:38:51 <Bosmon7> It is simply a package.json update
2017-06-16T18:39:07 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon7

2017-06-16T19:41:33 <gtirloni> Bosmon7: no worries, thanks a lot! :)
