2017-05-12T17:33:01 <kasparnet> I cant seem to find the main GPII component tree from within a testcaseholder
2017-05-12T17:33:10 <kasparnet> was there some crazy trick to it
2017-05-12T17:33:29 <kasparnet> ah
2017-05-12T17:33:53 <kasparnet> I just remembered
2017-05-12T17:34:14 <kasparnet> there was something in the context integration tests

2017-05-12T19:00:20 <avtar> kasparnet: should the universal test changes involving a locally deployed preferences server be sent to this branch as a pr? https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-1802
2017-05-12T19:01:08 <kasparnet> would that mean that the tests would pass, if it was merged?
2017-05-12T19:01:11 <kasparnet> ie. in CI?
2017-05-12T19:02:28 <avtar> i'm not sure.. the changes i'm talking about are more about finishing up the work we started yesterday with gio
2017-05-12T19:03:28 <avtar> so we'll have instances of couch and the preferences server running in a vm and have the production tests target this local preferences server
2017-05-12T19:04:18 <avtar> which branch, kaspar?
2017-05-12T19:04:23 <avtar> the branch
