b'2017-10-25T19:50:59 <Bosmon> But my best answer as things stand today is for you to supply a "contextAware limitRange transform"
2017-10-25T19:51:15 <Bosmon> Since I imagine you will have properly done all the computations about stuff sucking before the component begins to instantiate
2017-10-25T19:51:41 <colinclark> well, I think it\'s even better than that on almost all browsers
2017-10-25T19:51:45 <colinclark> (except Safari)
2017-10-25T19:51:53 <Bosmon> So this will allow you to mix in a grade, via contextAwareness, that has a "modelRelay to self" attached to this model value
2017-10-25T19:52:01 <colinclark> ok
2017-10-25T19:52:09 <colinclark> so, again being concrete, all Web Audio Nodes report a maxChannelCount value
2017-10-25T19:52:15 <colinclark> and it\'s always accurate except in Safair
2017-10-25T19:52:18 <Bosmon> I see that limitRange is not in our docs
2017-10-25T19:52:24 <colinclark> so Safari I can make contextually unique
2017-10-25T19:52:30 <Bosmon> sucks
2017-10-25T19:52:58 <colinclark> but then I guess I can just use a straight limitRange transform that uses the node\'s maxChannelCount to set the limit
2017-10-25T19:52:58 <Bosmon> But here it is: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L615
2017-10-25T19:53:02 <colinclark> perfect
2017-10-25T19:53:14 <colinclark> this, I will implement right away and live with the Safari bug for now
2017-10-25T19:53:23 <colinclark> so, I can\'t tell if I\'m crazy
2017-10-25T19:53:32 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t seem to be upcoming in a docs pull either :(
2017-10-25T19:53:44 <colinclark> but I am finding it immensely useful to think through the requirements for Signaletic by implementing a prototype of it in Infusion
2017-10-25T19:53:55 <Bosmon> colinclark - well, that\'s pretty interesting
2017-10-25T19:54:02 <colinclark> with the idea, I guess, that it will be clear what kind of a "subset" of Infusion we will need for it
2017-10-25T19:54:14 <colinclark> but I guess this will require a certain amount of reflection and discipline
2017-10-25T19:54:17 <Bosmon> And I think is reminiscent of the way I debugged shader code by writing a kind of pseudo-dialect of it in JavaScript
2017-10-25T19:54:23 <colinclark> ah, fascinating
2017-10-25T19:54:31 <Bosmon> It took about 2 seconds to render a postage-stamp sized image
2017-10-25T19:54:36 <colinclark> right, I remember that
2017-10-25T19:54:42 <Bosmon> As compared to being able to render full screen well above frame rate : P
2017-10-25T19:54:50 <colinclark> Having not use the "pure" Web Audio API much, I can\'t fully see the problem space
2017-10-25T19:54:50 <Bosmon> But it would have been impossible without this technique
2017-10-25T19:55:04 <Bosmon> I was rambling on to sgithens 2 nights about about the importance of "approach" : P
2017-10-25T19:55:13 <colinclark> and by implementing something simple first in Infusion, I can at least understand how we\'d want the pieces to fit together
2017-10-25T19:55:19 <colinclark> I am already learning a lot :)
2017-10-25T19:55:31 <colinclark> Tell me about "approach" :)
2017-10-25T19:55:31 <Bosmon> As being the crucial determiner, perhaps above intellect and knowledge, in success or failure on many kinds of project : P
2017-10-25T19:55:45 <colinclark> I mean, clearly one needs to have one
2017-10-25T19:55:50 <colinclark> and to be reflective enough to know what it is :P
2017-10-25T19:55:52 <Bosmon> I was telling him about how I totally failed, throughout my teenage years, in ever writing an assembler program which worked
2017-10-25T19:55:54 <colinclark> and to be able to articulate it
2017-10-25T19:55:58 <colinclark> wow
2017-10-25T19:56:04 <Bosmon> And this repeated failure has to be ascribed to failure of APPROACH : P
2017-10-25T19:56:30 <Bosmon> I would just try to code some ludicrously ambitious thing, such as a flood fill algorithm which required nested loops and possibly even a stack
2017-10-25T19:56:38 <colinclark> aha
2017-10-25T19:56:41 <Bosmon> And then it would fail, corrupting all system memory
2017-10-25T19:56:50 <colinclark> as bad assembly programs tend to do
2017-10-25T19:56:53 <Bosmon> I would then have to load everything back in from an AUDIO CASSTTE taking about 8 minutes : P
2017-10-25T19:56:59 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-10-25T19:57:01 <Bosmon> And then do this again until I got too frustrated to continue
2017-10-25T19:57:20 <colinclark> so, assuming you stuck with assembler, what would the change in approach have had to be?
2017-10-25T19:57:28 <Bosmon> To my credit, I did try coding this on paper first
2017-10-25T19:57:37 <colinclark> very good
2017-10-25T19:57:48 <Bosmon> But yes, I should have tried to make a working implementation in some more tractable, vastly slower language
2017-10-25T19:58:07 <Bosmon> Unfortunately in those days I wasn\'t particularly clear on how the isomorphism between subsets of languages might work
2017-10-25T19:58:13 <colinclark> not to have built up your algorithm from simpler units that were tractable in assembly?
2017-10-25T19:58:31 <Bosmon> And I guess had no confidence that I could reliably code in, say, BASIC, in a way which was going to have a one-for-one direct translation to assembler
2017-10-25T19:58:40 <colinclark> right
2017-10-25T19:59:16 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I can reliably code in Infusion in a way that can have a one-for-one direct translation into this non-existent Signaletic implementation :)
2017-10-25T19:59:23 <colinclark> but at least we will have some hard examples of "don\'t do this"
2017-10-25T19:59:31 <colinclark> and "this is essential to the system being able to function"
2017-10-25T19:59:37 <Bosmon> Despite having had a comparable experience with writing shader code as I had had with assembler in 1988, I guess I\'ve just had more experience "in general" to be clear about how expressions in different languages might work
2017-10-25T19:59:46 <colinclark> interesting
2017-10-25T20:00:34 <Bosmon> ON which note I can highly recommend this video which Marijn tweeted about a couple of days ago
2017-10-25T20:00:37 <Bosmon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAcDWcaezXY
2017-10-25T20:00:50 <Bosmon> Which completely humbled me about how few of these idioms I\'d heard of
2017-10-25T20:00:59 <Bosmon> LINDA is particularly interesting
2017-10-25T20:01:07 <Bosmon> And you could say even offers a kind of precedent for "selectors"
2017-10-25T20:01:20 <colinclark> oh interesting
2017-10-25T20:01:23 <Bosmon> Although there is no materialised tree structure as such
2017-10-25T20:01:32 <Bosmon> The speaker is actually very scathing about Linda
2017-10-25T20:01:48 <colinclark> on what grounds?
2017-10-25T20:01:55 <Bosmon> But her kind of "student-crowd-sourced book" looks as if it would be very interesting
2017-10-25T20:02:00 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s hard to say on what grounds
2017-10-25T20:02:16 <Bosmon> But she editorialises the claims of the developers in a way which she doesn\'t for any other language
2017-10-25T20:02:26 <Bosmon> Things like "This is a plus, in the eyes of the authors"
2017-10-25T20:02:49 <Bosmon> And emphasises how "wacky" and "way out" it is to have a total decoupling between the producers and consumers of state
2017-10-25T20:03:40 <Bosmon> Personally I\'d given up on bringing shared-memory systems into the fold
2017-10-25T20:03:48 <Bosmon> But it\'s interesting to see that there are some approaches to it
2017-10-25T20:04:24 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2017-10-25T20:24:27 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-10-25T20:31:36 <simonjb> Bosmon, colinclark: back in my PhD days, I experimented with a Linda-inspired system for Java called JavaSpaces
2017-10-25T20:31:39 <simonjb> https://www.javaworld.com/article/2076533/data-storage/make-room-for-javaspaces--part-1.html
2017-10-25T20:31:44 <colinclark> oh wow

2017-10-25T20:32:07 <colinclark> Jini!
2017-10-25T20:32:17 <simonjb> yeah, many years ago :)
2017-10-25T20:32:28 <colinclark> and now we have the philips hue :)
2017-10-25T20:33:00 <colinclark> Didn\'t Sun demonstrate Jini-enabled lightbulbs back when they were promoting it?
2017-10-25T20:33:34 <colinclark> I must have made that up
2017-10-25T20:34:27 <simonjb> it\'s very possible
2017-10-25T20:34:33 <colinclark> it\'s pretty interesting, the more I randomly google for this
2017-10-25T20:35:06 <colinclark> There\'s also the problem of creating Jini "objects" for everything that might be included in a network. Each object - a small piece of software written in Sun\'s Java computer language - explains what the thing itself can do, and provides a way to operate it. Writing a Jini object for a light bulb might be fairly simple, but writing one for a car engine or digital video camera will be harder, and creating all the objects needed "will take a lot of
2017-10-25T20:35:07 <colinclark> work over many years", says Joy.
2017-10-25T20:35:21 <colinclark> This is kind of the pure expression of OO :)
2017-10-25T20:35:31 <colinclark> an Object for every object
2017-10-25T20:35:35 <simonjb> I think I still have a copy of David Gelernter\'s book Mirror Worlds somewhere
2017-10-25T20:36:10 <colinclark> oh man
2017-10-25T20:36:12 <colinclark> this is wild
2017-10-25T20:36:46 <colinclark> 1993
2017-10-25T20:36:58 <colinclark> shit, just reading the publisher\'s description is fascinating
2017-10-25T20:38:14 <simonjb> it\'s been ages since I read it but I remember it being pretty interesting
2017-10-25T20:38:27 <colinclark> I think the 90s are back
2017-10-25T20:38:31 <colinclark> and not just vapourwave

2017-10-25T20:38:51 <simonjb> and AI
2017-10-25T20:39:01 <colinclark> yes!
2017-10-25T20:40:01 <colinclark> I\'m just trying to get my head around all the consequences of Gelernter\'s concept of "reality"
2017-10-25T20:40:36 <simonjb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality#/media/File:VPL_DataSuit_1.jpg
2017-10-25T20:40:49 <colinclark> this is very topical
2017-10-25T20:41:06 <colinclark> michelled passed along the Vi Hart video you sent
2017-10-25T20:41:11 <colinclark> it was so fantastic
2017-10-25T20:41:23 <colinclark> but I got stuck on one thing
2017-10-25T20:41:27 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-10-25T20:41:36 <colinclark> her idea of the body being part of the VR systems she is using
2017-10-25T20:41:51 <simonjb> yeah, it\'s great -- I hadn\'t realised that she was doing such interesting work in VR
2017-10-25T20:41:57 <colinclark> so amazing
2017-10-25T20:42:11 <colinclark> it seems to me that the real issue is that body becomes totally "ocularized" with headsets and even AR-style approaches
2017-10-25T20:42:32 <colinclark> in that it becomes something to be "recognized" using video-based computer vision techniques
2017-10-25T20:42:44 <colinclark> whereas I really miss the idea of Caves
2017-10-25T20:42:48 <colinclark> or perhaps these hilarious suits
2017-10-25T20:43:04 <colinclark> in that the body at least, in a suit like this, is as equally instrumented as the eyes are
2017-10-25T20:43:09 <colinclark> at least externally
2017-10-25T20:43:29 <colinclark> anyway, the restorative yoga office is brilliant
2017-10-25T20:43:57 <colinclark> and suggested to me that the proprioceptive body is still largely unaccounted for in an interesting way :)
2017-10-25T20:46:23 <simonjb> when I discovered her VR work, I was reading back through her twitter stream and this one struck me as very interesting: https://twitter.com/vihartvihart/status/842089424410222592

2017-10-25T11:34:44 <dandimitrov> Hi, Bosmon, I\'d like to ask whether there is a mechanism in the `lifeCycleManager` for notifying about keyIn failure?
2017-10-25T11:34:51 <dandimitrov> We\'ve implemented an Electron "tray ballon" notification for KeyIn error, but it follows our current DEV workflow (through the KeyIn endpoint). We imagine that in a real-world scenario, the psp electron process should be notified via the socket or another place about an occurred KeyIn error.
2017-10-25T11:37:02 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov - the central point where there is notification of a keyin failure is here in the userLogonHandling: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L34
2017-10-25T11:38:00 <Bosmon> The request grade type is this one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L275
2017-10-25T11:38:11 <Bosmon> The comment here is helpful since we do not have "types" : P
2017-10-25T11:40:03 <Bosmon> But both varieties of the flowManger configuration will have requests which inherit via "gpii.flowManager.userLogonHandling.stateChangeHandler"
2017-10-25T11:40:32 <Bosmon> In general you want to add yourself as a listener to the "onError" event of this request type
2017-10-25T11:40:50 <Bosmon> The LifecycleManager isn\'t involved since it never gets any notification of the start of a lifecycle if there is a keyin error
2017-10-25T11:44:04 <Bosmon> The next question is - "How can I bind as a listener to this request?"
2017-10-25T11:45:44 <Bosmon> And the answer is - via an options distribution, which, for example, has a target of (from the point of view of the PCPChannel) {flowManager requests gpii.flowManager.userLogonHandling.stateChangeHandler}.options.listeners.onError
2017-10-25T11:45:49 <Bosmon> Or some similar selector
2017-10-25T11:49:15 <dandimitrov> hmmm, we\'ll give it a try
2017-10-25T11:49:25 <dandimitrov> Thanks, Bosmon
2017-10-25T11:51:19 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - you can see an example of a similar kind of binding in the PCPChannel here: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/13a8f45683f88c6cf5ae6ff68f3eee8dff5cbc05/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L52
2017-10-25T11:51:47 <Bosmon> The name "{flowManager}.pcpChannel" will be visible from the request site so I suggest that you stick your event listener somewhere around there
2017-10-25T11:52:17 <Bosmon> That is, to add some kind of event on the PCPChannel, for example, onKeyInError, and add that as a listener to the relevant request

2017-10-25T15:05:07 <Bosmon> Hi dandimitrov - well, it will work, but it\'s a bit crass : P
2017-10-25T15:05:39 <Bosmon> Firstly calling the uncaughtExceptionHandler manually is likely to lead to inconsistencies in the future
2017-10-25T15:05:54 <Bosmon> Secondly, you are destroying any information from the original error which might be useful for further processing
2017-10-25T15:06:44 <Bosmon> Well, I guess there is past form for this, in tersm of the existing EADDRINUSE code made by stegru .........
2017-10-25T15:07:36 <Bosmon> So I guess this would pass code review in the terms that you hadn\'t made the existing situation any worse
2017-10-25T15:08:06 <Bosmon> But really there is a problem using uncaught exception handlers for everyday business, in that node.js doesn\'t guarantee that the VM is usable after a genuine uncaught exception is triggered
2017-10-25T15:08:11 <Bosmon> So we\'re going to have to think this
2017-10-25T15:08:26 <Bosmon> If we have time at the end of today\'s architecture meeting let\'s make it an agenda item
2017-10-25T15:08:35 <Bosmon> think -> rethink

2017-10-25T15:12:23 <stegru> really, the EADDRINUSE was a hack.. for the HST
2017-10-25T15:13:44 <stegru> javjarfer: have you noticed anything strange with MSDN today?
2017-10-25T15:14:21 <javjarfer> stegru, hi! good afternoon, I have just saw that my pr for 1053 has failed in the installer building phase "windows-create-vm"
2017-10-25T15:14:29 <javjarfer> mmm not really
2017-10-25T15:14:39 <javjarfer> slowly than usual maybe?
2017-10-25T15:14:50 <javjarfer> slower than*
2017-10-25T15:15:01 <javjarfer> but that is not so remarkable xD

2017-10-25T15:15:57 <stegru> dandimitrov: could you add any error messages into this document please? we need to maintain a list of them, so they can be re-worded by UX (or even translated)
2017-10-25T15:16:01 <stegru> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d63BScq3yVXqopKEqlnPHZtH3Tb2SiT8DR3HCap4PPA/edit?usp=sharing
2017-10-25T15:16:57 <stegru> javjarfer: i\'ve searched for a few API calls, and they\'re missing off google (they\'re normally #1), but instead i see a page on docs.microsoft.com
2017-10-25T15:18:57 <javjarfer> stegru, that is really weird, I haven\'t observed that
2017-10-25T15:19:28 <javjarfer> maybe Microsoft is going to actually re-write theirs docs for humans?
2017-10-25T15:20:05 <stegru> i have an "i\'m feeling lucky" search, like "site:msdn.microsoft.com <keyword>", and it\'s now faulty
2017-10-25T15:20:20 <stegru> i\'d prefer they re-wrote it for developers, not humans ;)

2017-10-25T15:33:55 <yuriy> stegru: thank you, I added the text for the error in the document
2017-10-25T15:34:05 <stegru> :*

2017-10-25T15:37:56 <yuriy> Bosmon: unfortunately, this time it will only be me on the call, but if we end up discussing this, I can pass it along to the georgitodorov and dandimitrov
2017-10-25T15:46:53 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-10-25T15:47:27 <alanharnum> grrrero, your responsive UIO changes are deployed to https://github.com/fluid-project/sojustrepairit.org - looks good to me! thanks
2017-10-25T15:48:59 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, do you refer to the manual fire of `onUncaughtException` with the `uncaughtExceptionHandler`. Yeah, I agree it\'s a mess
2017-10-25T15:49:38 <dandimitrov> But is the `distributeOptions` part ok?
2017-10-25T15:57:06 <dandimitrov> Ideally, we imagined that we\'d have an invoker or sth on the `app` for general handling (i.e. show the ballon notification) of errors, thus avoiding some strange low-level event firing ^
2017-10-25T15:59:08 <dandimitrov> We also had trouble adding any args to the attached listener. Is it possible to do such thing via `distributeOptions`?
2017-10-25T16:00:04 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-10-25T16:01:45 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes, the distributeOptions is perfect
2017-10-25T16:02:08 <Bosmon> dandimitrov, yes, you can args - but bear in mind that any args you add there will be resolved from the point of view of the target
2017-10-25T16:02:14 <Bosmon> What args would you like to add?
2017-10-25T16:03:10 <dandimitrov> I was thinking of the `tray` object, or some wrapper
2017-10-25T16:04:47 <dandimitrov> in order to have access to the tray balloon, which is more of a temporal solution as I imagine this notification container is more likely to change^

2017-10-25T16:07:54 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - it might be better to bind all of those things in the event listener which you will eventually write ...

2017-10-25T16:52:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: for your meeting about nock.. we currently use mockjax in infusion https://github.com/jakerella/jquery-mockjax and have used sinon.js for other mocking in other places http://sinonjs.org It may be worthwhile to evaluate those against/with nock.
2017-10-25T16:52:18 <Justin_o> Also could be useful to know if we should switch off of any of the above
2017-10-25T16:52:23 * sgithens has quit
2017-10-25T16:53:04 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, do you know where we use sinon.js
2017-10-25T16:53:24 <cindyli> i know jquery-mockjax is used everywhere in infusion tests
2017-10-25T16:56:07 <Justin_o> uio+ uses a variant chrome-sinon, but i can\'t remember where else we\'ve tried it out

2017-10-25T17:00:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: sinon is used in fluid-publish https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish
2017-10-25T17:01:54 <cindyli> ok

2017-10-25T19:48:08 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'ve probably asked you this kind of question before over the years
2017-10-25T19:48:16 <colinclark> related to the semantic of the Change Applier
2017-10-25T19:48:37 <Bosmon> Hi there colinclark
2017-10-25T19:48:42 <colinclark> I have a case that I am working on where one may set the model to a particular value
2017-10-25T19:48:49 <colinclark> I\'ll be somewhat concrete
2017-10-25T19:48:50 <Bosmon> Yes, often just before we are leaving a crowded subway train, etc : P
2017-10-25T19:48:53 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-10-25T19:49:00 <colinclark> model: { channelCount: 2 }
2017-10-25T19:49:29 <colinclark> So, optimistically, you might say, "well, I have a four-channel sound card, so I\'d like to set this value to 4"
2017-10-25T19:49:51 <colinclark> but for whatever reason, such as some browsers sucking, it may be impossible to actually set this value appropriately
2017-10-25T19:50:09 <colinclark> what does one do to express this to the user, in context of the change applier?
2017-10-25T19:50:22 <Bosmon> Well
2017-10-25T19:50:32 <Bosmon> That\'s a pretty tough semantic question, from the point of view of today\'s applier
2017-10-25T19:50:39 <colinclark> yes :)
2017-10-25T19:50:48 <colinclark> in the past, this was more explicit with guards, I guess
