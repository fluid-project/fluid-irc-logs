2017-06-02T16:31:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have a node question. I\'m trying to write tests for https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/GPII-2424/extension/src/lib/domSettingsApplier.js
2017-06-02T16:31:46 * amatas has quit
2017-06-02T16:32:17 <Justin_o> I\'m having issues with the "chrome" reference being undefined on this line https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/GPII-2424/extension/src/lib/domSettingsApplier.js#L44
2017-06-02T16:32:42 <Justin_o> but this only happens when trying to run a test. It works fine when the extension is actually executing
2017-06-02T16:32:42 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes
2017-06-02T16:32:53 <Bosmon7> You have not put chrome into a proper Infusion namespace
2017-06-02T16:33:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so i should do something like gpii.chrome = chrome || require("chrome-ninon");
2017-06-02T16:33:31 <Bosmon7> Remember that Infusion\'s global doesn\'t generally agree with any particular global you might see in a particular file
2017-06-02T16:33:45 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it\'s cleaner just to use fluid.require which will do this for you automatically
2017-06-02T16:34:54 * javjarfer_ joined the channel
2017-06-02T16:36:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: ah okay, so i\'d do
2017-06-02T16:36:19 <Justin_o> var chrome  = chrome || fluid.require("sinon-chrome")
2017-06-02T16:36:28 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - no
2017-06-02T16:36:28 <Justin_o> so it\'s really just switching from require to fluid.require
2017-06-02T16:36:31 <Justin_o> okay :(
2017-06-02T16:37:22 <Bosmon7> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/NodeAPI.html#fluid-require-modulename-foreignrequire-namespace-
2017-06-02T16:39:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, so var chrome  = chrome || fluid.require("sinon-chrome", require, "chrome");
2017-06-02T16:39:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i assume the last portion will create something like fluid.chrome
2017-06-02T16:40:13 <Bosmon7> Justin_o, it will just create a top-level global named "chrome"
2017-06-02T16:41:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, thanks
2017-06-02T16:44:04 <colinclark> simonjb: let me know when you\'re done lunch and we can meet
2017-06-02T16:45:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks, it\'s all working now
2017-06-02T16:47:30 <simonjb> colinclark: just finished :)
2017-06-02T16:47:36 <colinclark> awesome
2017-06-02T16:47:41 <colinclark> Justin_o, will you join us too?
2017-06-02T16:47:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, just need to commit something, be ready in a minute
2017-06-02T16:48:15 <colinclark> ok great
