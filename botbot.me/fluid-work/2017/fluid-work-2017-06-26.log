2017-06-26T13:45:47 <Jess_> alanharnum: ping
2017-06-26T13:45:55 <alanharnum> Jess__: ping
2017-06-26T13:46:10 <Jess_> alanharnum: can you verify whether or not the vidyo gateway is up?
2017-06-26T13:46:43 * kasparne_ has quit
2017-06-26T13:47:46 <alanharnum> Jess__: looks like it's down - it may need to rebooted again
2017-06-26T13:47:55 <Jess_> gah
2017-06-26T13:48:05 <Jess_> alanharnum: that would explain why we can\xe2\x80\x99t connect to Israel
2017-06-26T13:48:30 <alanharnum> I can come in and recycle it
2017-06-26T13:49:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: I'm trying to decide if I should start on the UIO+ panel or the TTS adaptation first. I'm not sure what is higher priority. There are browser extensions to fall back to ( ChromeVox, click2speech) for the TTS features, but if the purpose is just to show adaptations in the browser, I'm not sure how necessary the panel is. Any recommendation?
2017-06-26T13:50:25 <alanharnum> Jess__: It will probably take me about 45 to get in and recycle it in the DC
2017-06-26T13:51:06 <Jess_> alanharnum: no hurry
2017-06-26T13:51:25 <Jess_> we are going to reschedule for Thursday
2017-06-26T13:51:41 <alanharnum> Jess__ OK - I'll coordinate a restart with gtirloni
2017-06-26T13:52:38 <Jess_> alanharnum: and perhaps we should figure out why it keeps going down
2017-06-26T13:52:55 <Jess_> not sure if that\xe2\x80\x99s possible \xe2\x80\x94 genuinely \xe2\x80\x94 how much info do we get from it?
2017-06-26T13:53:07 <Jess_> gtirloni: perhaps Vidyo can help us out with troubleshooting
2017-06-26T13:53:29 <alanharnum> Jess__: we haven't seen anything obvious in the logs when we've looked
2017-06-26T13:53:44 <Jess_> alanharnum: have you all reached out to Vidyo for supoprt?
2017-06-26T13:53:46 <alanharnum> it could be the gateway or it could be a broader networking issue
2017-06-26T13:53:56 <Jess_> ah
2017-06-26T13:54:35 <alanharnum> the gateway logs themselves don't report any issues, but it seems to just become uncontactable from the wider internet
2017-06-26T13:54:58 <Jess_> weird alanharnum
2017-06-26T13:55:23 <alanharnum> i'll take the KVM adapter and see if I can hook up to a display when I go
2017-06-26T13:55:38 <alanharnum> which may tell us more
2017-06-26T13:56:00 <Jess_> alanharnum: did it get rebooted this last time gtirloni told us it was down or is it just still down?
2017-06-26T13:56:29 <Jess_> maybe this isn\xe2\x80\x99t *another* down but the \xe2\x80\x98still down\xe2\x80\x99?
2017-06-26T13:56:45 <alanharnum> Jess_ tbh I think it might just still be down - I think I slipped on getting it rebooted :( sorry
2017-06-26T13:57:35 <Jess_> alanharnum: ah, ok. well at least it feels less chronic! ok, i have a test Thursday 8 a.m. \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m hoping it can be fixed up by then?
2017-06-26T13:57:53 <alanharnum> yeah I'll do it as soon as gtirloni is available to verify from remote
2017-06-26T13:58:20 <gtirloni> hi Jess_ alanharnum
2017-06-26T13:58:28 <gtirloni> i was afk, sorry
2017-06-26T13:59:14 <alanharnum> gtirloni, I can recycle the gateway tomorrow or wednesday, whatever works best for you
2017-06-26T13:59:25 <gtirloni> alanharnum: any time works for me :)
2017-06-26T13:59:31 <alanharnum> ok

2017-06-26T14:10:31 <colinclark> Justin_o: I'm not sure what the best answer to your question is
2017-06-26T14:10:47 * Jess_ has quit
2017-06-26T14:11:04 <colinclark> My temptation would be to bootstrap the process by using click2speech and focus on the improvements needed to the UIO panel
2017-06-26T14:11:12 <colinclark> especially things like adding the arrows, which we've wanted for years already :)
2017-06-26T14:11:29 <colinclark> it's a relatively safe bet, I think, since in general people seem to really like click2speech
2017-06-26T14:12:07 <jessm> alanharnum: here now as other me /jessm
2017-06-26T14:14:28 <alanharnum> jessm: yup, will do
2017-06-26T14:18:33 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, that seems reasonable
