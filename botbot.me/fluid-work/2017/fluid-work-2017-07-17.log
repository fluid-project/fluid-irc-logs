b'2017-07-17T20:56:04 <gtirloni> ah, it\'s already documented here in some form: https://github.com/gpii-ops/docker-preferences-dataloader
2017-07-17T20:56:19 <gtirloni> spin up couchdb, load prefs data, start prefs server
2017-07-17T20:56:35 <gtirloni> but that\'s using the pre-Alpine settings
2017-07-17T20:56:47 <gtirloni> so not very useful, except for starting CouchDB and loading the data
2017-07-17T20:57:32 <gtirloni> one sec
2017-07-17T21:00:11 <colinclark> cool, as I say, I\'m just trying to slot in all the conceptual pieces I can
2017-07-17T21:00:18 <colinclark> knowing of course that we\'re still in the midst of making it work

2017-07-17T21:08:10 * jhung has quit
2017-07-17T21:08:14 <gtirloni> that should give you prefs server on port 9001 and flow manager on port 9002
2017-07-17T21:08:32 <gtirloni> and couchdb (loaded with test data) on 5984
2017-07-17T21:09:01 <gtirloni> just adjust the image name (end of the docker command) from \'universal\' to the name you used, if different
2017-07-17T21:12:53 <colinclark> that\'s great, gtirloni
2017-07-17T21:12:57 <colinclark> we\'re making progress
2017-07-17T21:12:59 <colinclark> i merged your PR
2017-07-17T21:13:04 <colinclark> but you snuck in that extra commit
2017-07-17T21:13:08 <colinclark> so github is confused
2017-07-17T21:13:23 <colinclark> and me :)
2017-07-17T21:14:07 <gtirloni> merged \'master\' ? wow, that was a while ago
2017-07-17T21:14:21 <gtirloni> i see the PR as open
2017-07-17T21:14:40 <gtirloni> (a while == 30min or so ago)
2017-07-17T21:14:45 <colinclark> yes
2017-07-17T21:15:01 <colinclark> to the best of my knowledge, that\'s because of the extra commit
2017-07-17T21:15:07 <colinclark> the one you pushed recently
2017-07-17T21:15:24 <colinclark> i assume it\'s because we both merged master into the branch
2017-07-17T21:15:27 <colinclark> but at different commits
2017-07-17T21:15:40 <colinclark> either that or I possibly screwed everything up :)
2017-07-17T21:15:46 <gtirloni> ah, got it. ok, the unmerged commit shouldn\'t matter then
2017-07-17T21:15:57 <colinclark> it shouldn\'t
2017-07-17T21:15:59 <gtirloni> i think GH might be a bit slow..
2017-07-17T21:16:07 <colinclark> sadly Github seemed not to have figured it out
2017-07-17T21:16:12 <gtirloni> gpii-bot even tested the merge and commented there
2017-07-17T21:16:14 <gtirloni> yeah
2017-07-17T21:16:26 <gtirloni> cool, colinclark thanks!
2017-07-17T21:17:03 <gtirloni> today i forked the \'ops\' repo, created a local branch, but that was still out of sync with the repo.. that was very weird
2017-07-17T21:17:13 <gtirloni> maybe it\'s eventual consistency :)
2017-07-17T21:18:26 <colinclark> ha!
2017-07-17T21:18:39 <colinclark> well, let me know if I\'ve obliterated part of the universe
2017-07-17T21:18:44 <colinclark> no pun intended

2017-07-17T21:38:02 <gtirloni> ok, CI is happy.. build times at 6min (from 13min previously) and "staging" and "production" containers redeployed, we\'re officially Alpine-powered
2017-07-17T21:38:09 <gtirloni> such hipsters
2017-07-17T21:39:35 <avtar> wow
2017-07-17T21:41:58 <avtar> everything feels like it has more disk space now
2017-07-17T21:42:12 <gtirloni> haha yeah, precious bits
2017-07-17T21:42:42 <gtirloni> i guess i was most impressed by the dataloader image going from 750MB+ to 10MB.. i guess we may have missed something in .dockerignore

2017-07-17T21:44:37 <avtar> shaving off ~14 mins is pretty decent
2017-07-17T21:47:26 <gtirloni> yep, for CI i think we don\'t care a lot.. but now with GPII-2470 and spinning up local containers for (some form of) e2e tests, that helps

2017-07-17T18:46:09 <avtar> alanharnum, gtirloni: what are your thoughts re: the use of docker containers for serving static content with nginx? Justin_o asked if there was a standard way of getting people set up to do that when working on frontend projects
2017-07-17T18:53:10 <gtirloni> usually depends on the software stack that will be used to build it.. there could be a container with all dev tools
2017-07-17T18:53:24 <gtirloni> or are you asking about how to actually deploy the website live?
2017-07-17T18:57:03 <gtirloni> in that case, there is no standard way.. people can use "FROM scratch; COPY . /somewhere" and that can be used in combination with a nginx container... or "FROM nginx" and provide nginx with the code (we probably want to have control over which nginx is used, so this would be more of a convenience for developers, not a production image)
2017-07-17T18:57:56 <gtirloni> for instance, that dev container idea -- https://github.com/idi-ops/docker-polymer
2017-07-17T18:58:52 <avtar> gtirloni: i think it\'s more so to just serve static content and use whatever build tools already available on the host os
2017-07-17T18:59:09 <gtirloni> ah got it
2017-07-17T18:59:21 <gtirloni> there are some examples here: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/
2017-07-17T18:59:56 <avtar> the alpine image might be a good start
2017-07-17T19:00:00 <avtar> i\'ll check it out
2017-07-17T19:00:09 <gtirloni> not sure you even need to create a new image
2017-07-17T19:00:24 <gtirloni> if it\'s only for serving content that was already built using OS tools

2017-07-17T20:18:58 <gtirloni> i\'ve closed mine as yours is way more complete (and it\'d create a conflict)
2017-07-17T20:21:49 <colinclark> gtirloni: Your instructions on https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/521 were super helpful
2017-07-17T20:22:06 <gtirloni> cool
2017-07-17T20:22:16 <colinclark> I was momentarily confused when I kept getting a Fedora 24 box provisioned, but I just needed to update your branch to the latest master
2017-07-17T20:22:35 <colinclark> and now the universal tests are streaming away in a Docker container running inside a Fedora 26 virtual machine
2017-07-17T20:22:52 <colinclark> and I\'m frying an omelette on my MacBook
2017-07-17T20:23:23 <gtirloni> ah sorry, i merged master and forgot to push
2017-07-17T20:24:37 <colinclark> no problem at all
2017-07-17T20:25:11 <colinclark> I still really love that F26 background image
2017-07-17T20:25:13 <colinclark> so great
2017-07-17T20:25:37 <gtirloni> yeah, i think it\'s relaxing
2017-07-17T20:26:32 <colinclark> I\'m also impressed by the inline JSON tree view when I make a request to the Preferences Server in Firefox
2017-07-17T20:27:21 <colinclark> gtirloni: I have a funny question for you
2017-07-17T20:27:49 <colinclark> this "universal" Docker image that I have built
2017-07-17T20:27:53 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-07-17T20:28:06 <colinclark> what exactly is it? :)
2017-07-17T20:28:20 <colinclark> Does it correspond directly to anything we actually deploy somewhere?
2017-07-17T20:28:28 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2017-07-17T20:29:30 * kavya has quit
2017-07-17T20:29:40 <gtirloni> yes, we used to manage it off tree (https://github.com/gpii-ops/docker-universal) but since GPII-1093 (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/327) it lives inside the universal repo
2017-07-17T20:30:06 <gtirloni> it\'s published in the Docker Hub (http://hub.docker.com/u/gpii/universal) and used to spin up the Preferences Server and Flow Manager containers
2017-07-17T20:31:08 <gtirloni> it\'s not the most efficient docker image we could have for production, because it contains dev dependencies and the layering is not optimal (http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2017-July/004592.html), but it\'s fine for our scale right now
2017-07-17T20:31:41 * kasparne_ has quit
2017-07-17T20:32:01 * kasparnet has quit
2017-07-17T20:32:05 <gtirloni> it\'s following the mantra of having what\'s running on developer\'s laptop into staging into production, all the same image
2017-07-17T20:32:35 <colinclark> yeah, makes sense
2017-07-17T20:33:13 <colinclark> so is there a separate container for the Preferences Server?
2017-07-17T20:33:17 <gtirloni> in the future we could have two dockerfiles in the repo, one for production and another for dev (the dev one can be improved with more tools for development then)... but what i described is what we have today
2017-07-17T20:34:05 <gtirloni> there used to be a separate container (and Ansible role) for the preferences server and the flow manager but they are unnecessary now (at least not necessary any longer for the features they provide.. they are provided through env vars directly from universal config files)
2017-07-17T20:34:13 <colinclark> ok
2017-07-17T20:34:59 <colinclark> are there any other artifacts I can look at that show me how, when deploying a preference server, we make use of this container?
2017-07-17T20:35:05 <colinclark> i\'m trying to fit all the pieces together
2017-07-17T20:35:07 <gtirloni> https://github.com/gpii-ops/ -- i\'ve marked them as deprecated, the single gpii/universal image can be used now --- CI changed proposed here: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ops/pull/78
2017-07-17T20:35:23 <gtirloni> *changes
2017-07-17T20:36:14 <colinclark> ok, so I think I see how all this fits together
2017-07-17T20:37:25 <colinclark> It looks like we\'ve got a kind generic driver now for "things deployed from the universal repo" which lets you specify a particular config to use
2017-07-17T20:37:40 <gtirloni> yeah
2017-07-17T20:37:57 <colinclark> ok
2017-07-17T20:38:17 <colinclark> and in the case of having run this command: docker run --rm -ti -p 8081:8081 universal npm start
2017-07-17T20:38:26 <gtirloni> right now only prefs server and flow manager are properly "instrumented" for production, but all other components could be started from this single image, provided we have config files with the appropriate features
2017-07-17T20:38:27 <colinclark> I am starting the default development config of universal
2017-07-17T20:38:32 <colinclark> right
2017-07-17T20:38:35 <gtirloni> yes, exactly
2017-07-17T20:38:38 <colinclark> those seem like the right two ones to start with
2017-07-17T20:38:41 * cindyli has quit
2017-07-17T20:38:56 <colinclark> ok, everything\'s making more sense
2017-07-17T20:39:36 <gtirloni> :)
2017-07-17T20:49:01 <colinclark> now if I wanted to test one of these production configs with my super hot VM here...
2017-07-17T20:49:04 <colinclark> could I?
2017-07-17T20:49:17 <colinclark> like if I wanted to start up a production PS?
2017-07-17T20:52:58 <colinclark> gtirloni: ^
2017-07-17T20:53:51 <gtirloni> one sec, let me get the steps
2017-07-17T20:54:15 <colinclark> yup sorry
2017-07-17T20:54:16 <colinclark> no rush!
2017-07-17T20:54:32 <gtirloni> btw that\'s what GPII-2470 is about.. but that\'s still not ready, i had to work on many other dependencies (but they\'re now in place)

2017-07-17T10:32:25 <jhernandez> Bosmon: morning DOCTOR - thanks for making windows use universal:trunk! :)
2017-07-17T10:32:42 <Bosmon> jhernandez - unfortunately as the-t-in-rtf1 has reported we have remaining problems
2017-07-17T10:32:53 <Bosmon> Our libraries are still not good enough to run from a bare drive root such as V:
2017-07-17T10:33:04 <jhernandez> oh
2017-07-17T10:33:07 <jhernandez> :(
2017-07-17T10:33:42 <jhernandez> well, then we should wait until this new vagrant box can be used in our trunks
2017-07-17T10:36:52 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-07-17T10:52:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> The thing is, it doesn\'t cause any harm to upgrade the box by itself.
2017-07-17T10:52:45 <the-t-in-rtf1> It\'s only a problem if you have things set up not to run in the default c:/vagrant
2017-07-17T10:52:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> I might be the only person doing that.
2017-07-17T10:53:24 <the-t-in-rtf1> I didn\'t configure any of the packages I submitted pulls against to use that convention either, or to use Windows.
2017-07-17T10:53:37 <the-t-in-rtf1> (I mean other people\'s packages, not just the ones I maintain)
2017-07-17T11:14:07 <jhernandez> I see
2017-07-17T11:16:28 <jhernandez> well, AFAIK, windows or gpii-app always run things on c:\\vagrant, but I may be wrong - in any case, I\'ll submit pull requests in order to check whether the new box isn\'t a problem

2017-07-17T11:48:06 <the-t-in-rtf> There are 5 failing unit tests at least for me, but the acceptance tests pass.
2017-07-17T11:49:06 <the-t-in-rtf> There are no "require" failures from c:/vagrant
2017-07-17T11:51:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Interestingly, the windows tests in master pass or fail in the same way when run from v:/
2017-07-17T11:51:38 <the-t-in-rtf> v colon slash in case you got an emoticon there.
2017-07-17T11:52:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, at least the unit tests have the same results.
2017-07-17T11:54:10 <the-t-in-rtf> the acceptance tests also work.
2017-07-17T11:56:02 <stegru> why can\'t c:\\vagrant be linked to v:\\ - so when something is run from \\vagrant, it would resolve to v:\\ instead of \\\\vbox..
2017-07-17T12:07:56 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-07-17T12:09:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Is anyone else seeing 5 unit test failures when running the windows tests against master?
2017-07-17T12:09:54 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-07-17T12:12:34 <jhernandez> nope, everything went fine
2017-07-17T12:12:58 <jhernandez> in fact I merged master into hst-2017 branch and it\'s still passing
2017-07-17T12:13:13 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/130
2017-07-17T12:16:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Are you running the tests locally on a Windows machine, or in Vagrant?

2017-07-17T12:36:31 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s really odd, as I consistently get failures in vagrant (newest box).
2017-07-17T12:37:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I noticed that we didn\'t have a) a standard `npm test` command for that package or b) code coverage reports, so I put in a PR here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/131
2017-07-17T12:37:24 <the-t-in-rtf> probably that\'ll need to be updated once @amatas work on a new Vagrant config for that package is available.

2017-07-17T12:50:42 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: by any chance, are these the failures you\'re getting? https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/174/console

2017-07-17T12:52:58 <jhernandez> stegru: can you take a look at those failing tests?
2017-07-17T12:53:40 <jhernandez> they are SPI-related

2017-07-17T13:23:21 <the-t-in-rtf1> @Bosmon and others who are curious, I put together a quick pull to generate code coverage reports for the windows repo.  Here\'s sample output: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/coverage-reports/windows/20170717/
2017-07-17T13:23:37 <the-t-in-rtf1> Again, that PR is here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/131
2017-07-17T13:26:38 * jhung joined the channel
2017-07-17T13:26:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> The test failures may account for the relatively low coverage of the spi code.
2017-07-17T13:27:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> it actually looks better than any of our core repos did when we first started reporting, which is good.
2017-07-17T13:33:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> @avtar, @gtirloni, @amatas, whomever is responsible for the windows pulls, this looks like a CI failure outside of my control: http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/ci/2017-July/000701.html
2017-07-17T13:33:34 * simonjb has quit
2017-07-17T13:34:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> The same test commands should work, and I didn\'t change the Vagrantfile or provisioning.
2017-07-17T13:34:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> sorry, by "windows pulls" I mean the CI integration with pulls against the windows repo.
2017-07-17T13:34:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> never mind.
2017-07-17T13:34:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> I see that that is a very old report, I thought it was reverse chronological order.
2017-07-17T13:35:04 <the-t-in-rtf1> The actual failures are exactly as we\'ve been discussing.

2017-07-17T14:20:26 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf1: the issue of the CI of Jul 5 should be solved
2017-07-17T14:21:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> Yes, I commented on that a while back.  The second link is the failure we\'re seeing now.
2017-07-17T14:25:35 <Bosmon> stegru - do we know about the Windows Unit Test failures that the-t-in-rtf has mentioned?
2017-07-17T14:25:37 <Bosmon> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/ci/2017-July/000740.html
2017-07-17T14:25:48 <Bosmon> Ah, I see jhernandez already pinged you
2017-07-17T14:25:50 <stegru> yes,
2017-07-17T14:25:53 <stegru> yes
2017-07-17T14:30:56 * clown stegru is so agreeable
2017-07-17T14:31:16 <stegru> i agree, clown
2017-07-17T14:31:22 <clown> lol
2017-07-17T14:32:47 <stegru> jhernandez: the-t-in-rtf Bosmon : i suspect this has something to do with the new vagrant box amatas has just released (assuming CI pulls the latest one)
2017-07-17T14:33:01 <stegru> only because that\'s the only change
2017-07-17T14:34:04 <Bosmon> stegru - ok, interesting
2017-07-17T14:34:09 <Bosmon> What are the changes in the vagrant box?

2017-07-17T15:21:49 <stegru> Bosmon: jhernandez : if you just want a quick fix, then it would be acceptable to remove the failing test, because it tests an SPI setting that doesn\'t actually get used by gpii (SPI_GETMOUSE)
2017-07-17T15:22:00 <amatas> stegru: yes, the CI is using the latest windows VM
2017-07-17T15:22:37 <stegru> that does make sense, amatas
2017-07-17T15:22:41 <amatas> :)
2017-07-17T15:23:07 <clown> amatas, I followed the steps from your email.
2017-07-17T15:23:08 <amatas> but it seems that a lot of problems raised since the update
2017-07-17T15:23:31 <clown> what other information do you need?  VBox version, maybe?
2017-07-17T15:23:37 <amatas> clown: but which repository are you testing, which command are you running?
2017-07-17T15:23:49 <stegru> i\'ll leave you alone, then :)
2017-07-17T15:24:13 <clown> I\'m launching the VM for the windows master branch
2017-07-17T15:24:27 <clown> I was running "vagrant up" from the host machine.
2017-07-17T15:24:40 <clown> I didn\'t get to the point of running any tests.
