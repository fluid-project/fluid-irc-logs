2017-05-10T16:22:21 <colinclark> just giving you a heads up that i was trying to update the calendar
2017-05-10T16:22:27 <colinclark> i think i've got it right but you should probably double check
2017-05-10T16:37:14 <gtirloni> github releases.. https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release
2017-05-10T16:37:17 <gtirloni> we can automate this for sure

2017-05-10T16:40:54 <the-t-in-rtf> There are multiple projects that demonstrate automatically uploading to an existing tag: https://github.com/aktau/github-release
2017-05-10T16:40:55 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/itchio/gothub is a more updated fork of same.
2017-05-10T16:40:55 <the-t-in-rtf> Not suggesting using those, only looking at their approach.

2017-05-10T13:30:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, all.  Are we in the same Vidyo room today?
2017-05-10T13:31:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess so, I see Alfredo there already.

2017-05-10T14:25:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: so i\'ve been playing with the browser extension
2017-05-10T14:25:51 <Justin_o> i can get ChromeVox to enable/disable if i create my own web socket server that sends the preferences
2017-05-10T14:26:12 <Justin_o> I\'m guessing that the ones in the defaults are getting set too early or something
2017-05-10T14:26:30 <Justin_o> or it could have something to do with initialization of the browser extension
2017-05-10T14:26:34 <cindyli> ah ha. good finding

2017-05-10T14:45:55 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o

2017-05-10T14:51:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: do you have an example of what we want for syllabification, is it just something that would show what the syllables in a word are, or something more?
2017-05-10T14:51:37 <colinclark> Check the Microsoft Learning Tools videos
2017-05-10T14:51:39 <colinclark> have you seen those
2017-05-10T14:51:44 <colinclark> ?
2017-05-10T14:51:56 <colinclark> I think that\'s where Gregg\'s initial interest came from\xe2\x80\x94they seem to have done an interesting job of it
2017-05-10T14:52:04 <Justin_o> i think so, but it\'s been quite a while
2017-05-10T14:52:24 <colinclark> I think Read & Write Gold probably does something like this, too, so it\'s worth having a look at it
2017-05-10T14:54:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, just watched a video.. so we\'re hoping for something that transforms the text inline, or would something like what this plugin does be sufficient https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodwordguidecom-instant/mfembjnmeainjncdflaoclcjadfhpoim
2017-05-10T14:55:21 <colinclark> I believe the idea is inline transformation
2017-05-10T14:57:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay thanks, maybe the above plugin could be a temporary solution while we work on finding something or implementing something more inline
2017-05-10T14:57:46 <Justin_o> ?
2017-05-10T14:58:00 <colinclark> perhaps
2017-05-10T14:58:09 <colinclark> there\'s a funny dynamic with the UX team, or parts of them
2017-05-10T14:58:19 <colinclark> where if they see something that isn\'t perfect, they get a bit, well, excited
2017-05-10T14:59:12 <Justin_o> hmm.. okay
2017-05-10T14:59:13 <colinclark> so my preference would be to start on the easier transformations first, and just not worry too muhc about stopgaps or temporary solutions
2017-05-10T14:59:27 <colinclark> have you seen the results from the recent usability testing at the AJCs?
2017-05-10T14:59:43 <colinclark> they\'re worth reading as a way to orient you to what things MIGHT be like when we get to pilots
2017-05-10T14:59:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: i was wondering about it because it\'s an extension that we should be able to enable, by following javi\'s work on enabling chromevox
2017-05-10T14:59:53 <colinclark> but to be clear, they\'re not "requirements"
2017-05-10T15:00:11 <Justin_o> so i was hoping to enable all the extension based transforms first, then move onto the others
2017-05-10T15:00:14 <colinclark> right
2017-05-10T15:00:28 <colinclark> I think I\'d only bother enabling extensions that do exactly what we need, to begin with
2017-05-10T15:00:39 <colinclark> people will probably get... excited... by something that is more of a stopgap
2017-05-10T15:00:46 <colinclark> :)
2017-05-10T15:01:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: so what about ChromeVox, it doesn\'t have a play/pause button, but i wonder if it\'s close enough
2017-05-10T15:01:39 <colinclark> It\'s probably not, no :)
2017-05-10T15:01:52 <colinclark> We don\'t have designs for this that are approved by the UX team yet
2017-05-10T15:01:58 <colinclark> so it\'s something we should raise with Sandra
2017-05-10T15:02:12 <colinclark> so that she can make a "what should this look like?" list for the UX team
2017-05-10T15:02:29 <colinclark> but I think ChromeVox is really optimized for a use case we\'re not really targetting
2017-05-10T15:02:35 <colinclark> i.e. it\'s more of a general purpose in-browser screen reader
2017-05-10T15:02:48 <colinclark> whereas we want the kind of TTS that helps people who have difficulty reading, but who can see the screen
2017-05-10T15:03:00 <Justin_o> ah okay
2017-05-10T15:03:10 * avtar joined the channel
2017-05-10T15:03:53 <Justin_o> should i send these questions out to the list, or do you think we\'ll have time to fit them into this weeks schedule?
2017-05-10T15:03:58 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2017-05-10T15:04:48 * jhernandez joined the channel
2017-05-10T15:05:13 <colinclark> I would suggest that you make a list for yourself, to start
2017-05-10T15:05:20 <colinclark> and then we can fit them in today or tomorrow before sandra leaves
2017-05-10T15:05:31 <colinclark> if that doesn\'t turn out to be possible, you and I can schedule a meeting with her next week to talk about it

2017-05-10T15:59:40 <colinclark> this time I\'m booked with interviews
2017-05-10T15:59:55 <colinclark> Did Emily ever settle on a new schedule for our weekly PhET accessibility-related meetings?
2017-05-10T16:01:33 <kasparnet> bon appetit the-t-in-rtf
2017-05-10T16:02:53 <the-t-in-rtf> cheers
2017-05-10T16:03:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ve been afk all these times checking on it to make sure it didn\'t burn.
2017-05-10T16:07:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: i believe that emily\'s proposed new meeting times were all accepted as is
2017-05-10T16:07:35 <colinclark> and have we switched to them, Justin_o?
2017-05-10T16:08:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, starting this week
2017-05-10T16:08:15 <colinclark> ok
2017-05-10T16:08:40 <colinclark> so this Wednesday at noon meeting I see in the Fluid team calendar?
2017-05-10T16:08:42 <colinclark> I\'m so confused
2017-05-10T16:09:07 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, we probably just need to update those.. there was trouble changing the tuesday one to friday.. i think it came back
2017-05-10T16:09:16 <Justin_o> i didn\'t try to change any others though
2017-05-10T16:09:32 <colinclark> was there an email about the meetings that I missed somehow?
2017-05-10T16:09:40 <Justin_o> seems like someone fixed the tuesday one again...
2017-05-10T16:09:41 <colinclark> and when are the sonification-related meetings now?
2017-05-10T16:10:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: forwarded you the e-mail
2017-05-10T16:10:17 <Justin_o> sonfication is Friday 1:30 ET
2017-05-10T16:10:32 <colinclark> thanks so much
2017-05-10T16:10:33 <Justin_o> but says every other week, so not sure if it\'s this week or next
2017-05-10T16:10:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: that was sonfication technical subgroup
2017-05-10T16:11:09 <Justin_o> sonificaiton design is the hour before
2017-05-10T16:15:16 <colinclark> right
2017-05-10T16:15:17 <colinclark> ok
2017-05-10T16:15:21 <jhung> Justin_o thanks for adding those meetings to Friday. colinclark I\'ll delete the Wednesday meetings.
2017-05-10T16:15:21 <colinclark> i\'m updating the calendar
2017-05-10T16:15:28 <colinclark> witht the ambiguity of which week we need
2017-05-10T16:16:57 <jhung> ok
2017-05-10T16:18:02 <colinclark> i\'m still so confused, jhung :)
