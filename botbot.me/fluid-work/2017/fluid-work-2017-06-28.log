2017-06-28T17:16:32 <gtirloni> cindyli: i\'d try to update to node 6.11 and see if the tests pass.. that\'s what we\'re using in CI
2017-06-28T17:17:17 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni
2017-06-28T17:17:28 <gtirloni> also, delete the npm cache if you can (npm cache clean -- i don\'t know where it lives in osx)
2017-06-28T17:17:39 <gtirloni> i have had some issues with old native modules hanging around
2017-06-28T17:18:29 <cindyli> ok. trying again
2017-06-28T17:19:53 <cindyli> same problem
2017-06-28T17:20:39 <gtirloni> any tests pass or does it fail right at the beginning ?
2017-06-28T17:23:23 <cindyli> at the beginning
2017-06-28T17:24:12 <gtirloni> interesting, something might be blocking those connections
2017-06-28T17:24:26 <gtirloni> do you have a firewall enabled? or Little Snitch (seems popular with OSX folks)?
2017-06-28T17:24:40 <gtirloni> also, can you run any universal tests from \'master\'? that\'d be the real test

2017-06-28T17:36:49 <cindyli> i will revert a few more commits back in that pull request
2017-06-28T17:37:25 <gtirloni> i wonder what\'s different between your environment and tony\'s
2017-06-28T17:38:11 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: we need help testing this PR on OSX (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/508)
2017-06-28T17:41:16 <cindyli> gtirloni: seems tests suddenly start passing this time after i switched back from the master. i did rmb to clean npm cache after the switch. waiting on it to finish. will re-run with the latest commit.

2017-06-28T17:51:40 <Justin_o> cindyli, gtirloni: was going to try to help test that, but i\'m getting an error that says "missing script: test:node"
2017-06-28T17:52:06 <Justin_o> forgot to merge ;(
2017-06-28T17:52:15 <cindyli> lol

2017-06-28T18:13:34 <Justin_o> cindyli, gtirloni: okay, so i actually merged in the code this time and am getting NPM errors when i try to run it
2017-06-28T18:13:55 <cindyli> what npm errors do you get, Justin_o
2017-06-28T18:13:59 <Justin_o> for example "Failed at the universal@0.3.0 test:node script \'npm run pretest:instrument && npm run pretest:copyUninstrumentedCode && npm run test:node-noprep\'."
2017-06-28T18:14:10 <cindyli> did you run "npm install"
2017-06-28T18:14:33 <cindyli> remove "node_modules/" folder before running "npm install"
2017-06-28T18:16:19 <cindyli> gtirloni, Justin_o, the good news is, I got all tests passing with the-t-in-rtf\'s branch. possibly a cache issue.
2017-06-28T18:16:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: i did that
2017-06-28T18:16:45 <Justin_o> i\'ll try again
2017-06-28T18:16:54 <gtirloni> cindyli: \\o/
2017-06-28T18:17:03 <cindyli> did you rebuild vagrant, Justin_o
2017-06-28T18:17:04 <Justin_o> i\'m also using a different version of npm and node than you
2017-06-28T18:17:10 <Justin_o> and i also rebuilt vagrant
2017-06-28T18:17:28 <Justin_o> i\'m on node v6.9.4 and npm 4.1.1
2017-06-28T18:18:00 <gtirloni> `npm run test:node` shouldn\'t depend on vagrant, it runs natively. the node_modules inside Vagrant is segregated... to avoid mixing different architectures
2017-06-28T18:22:08 <Justin_o> cindyli, gtirloni: I\'m still getting that error..  also noticed that i\'m getting this
2017-06-28T18:22:13 <Justin_o> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot find module \'universal\'
2017-06-28T18:22:13 <Justin_o> Error: Cannot find module \'universal\'
2017-06-28T18:22:20 * danayo joined the channel
2017-06-28T18:22:24 <Justin_o> maybe i\'m still missing something?
2017-06-28T18:22:28 <gtirloni> you need to clone universal inside a node_modules directory
2017-06-28T18:22:36 <gtirloni> mkdir node_modules; cd node_modules; git clone...
2017-06-28T18:22:59 <Justin_o> :(
2017-06-28T18:23:29 <gtirloni> i think it\'s needed for the tests, so they can self-reference (that\'s as much as I know)
2017-06-28T18:23:35 <gtirloni> there\'s a JIRA for that :)
2017-06-28T18:23:43 <Justin_o> :)
2017-06-28T18:24:11 <Justin_o> okay... well i\'m about to head offline anyways, so i\'ll just leave it at that.. let me know if you need more help testing tomorrow though
2017-06-28T18:24:21 <gtirloni> cool, thanks
2017-06-28T18:24:39 <gtirloni> cindyli: are we ready to push the merge button? :)
2017-06-28T18:25:30 <cindyli> not yet, more tests on "npm run test:node"

2017-06-28T18:27:18 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: no community meeting today
2017-06-28T18:27:46 <clown> thanks for the info Justin_o
2017-06-28T18:28:04 <gtirloni> cindyli: ok, let me know if there\'s anything else i need to do. at this point CI has been configured with the new commands (but that has not been committed to ci-service yet, so we can easily revert)
2017-06-28T18:28:22 <cindyli> gtirloni: "npm run test:node" still fails :\'( that\'s the command where I initially hit errors. i became confused after trying different things and switched the focus to "npm run test:vagrantNode", which is ok since the beginning
2017-06-28T18:28:40 <gtirloni> cindyli: i thought it was working after you switched from \'master\'
2017-06-28T18:28:45 <cindyli> let\'s see Justin_o\'s result
2017-06-28T18:28:52 <cindyli> the one working was "npm run test:vagrantNode"
2017-06-28T18:29:01 <cindyli> i blame my head too
2017-06-28T18:29:02 <gtirloni> oh ok, i think tony will need to check it tomorrow.. unfortunately i don\'t have access to any osx machines
2017-06-28T18:29:38 <gtirloni> np
2017-06-28T18:30:10 <Justin_o> gtirloni: if you need someone to test on OSX tomorrow, please let me know and i\'ll give it a shot again

2017-06-28T18:47:04 <gtirloni> nice!!
2017-06-28T18:47:07 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-06-28T18:48:59 <cindyli> Justin_o: which command did you run?
2017-06-28T18:49:13 <cindyli> "npm run test:node"?
2017-06-28T18:49:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes
2017-06-28T18:49:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: i didn\'t have vagrant running, maybe try again with that destroyed
2017-06-28T18:49:41 <cindyli> cool. i guess it\'s something wrong with my environment.
2017-06-28T18:51:18 <gtirloni> ahhhhhhhhh!
2017-06-28T18:51:25 <gtirloni> <Justin_o> cindyli: i didn\'t have vagrant running, maybe try again with that destroyed
2017-06-28T18:51:47 <cindyli> yes, that\'s the reason
2017-06-28T18:51:59 <cindyli> tests start passing after "vagrant halt"
2017-06-28T18:52:12 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L50
2017-06-28T18:52:28 <gtirloni> because we make 8081 available from the Vagrant box to make it easier for people to test it
2017-06-28T18:52:38 <gtirloni> test the code inside the VM
2017-06-28T18:52:43 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2017-06-28T18:52:55 <cindyli> yes, host and the vagrant are listening to the same port
2017-06-28T18:53:22 <gtirloni> another reason to get that env var discussion moving again, so we can have the tests running on some other port that is not hardcoded
2017-06-28T18:53:27 <gtirloni> ok, mystery solved i guess :)
2017-06-28T18:53:35 <Justin_o> yeah :)
2017-06-28T18:53:39 <gtirloni> Justin_o: thanks a lot
2017-06-28T18:53:50 <cindyli> merging in a minute after making sure all node tests pass.
2017-06-28T18:53:57 <Justin_o> no problem glad i could help :) although i only ran tests.. lol
2017-06-28T18:54:00 <gtirloni> awesome, thanks cindy

2017-06-28T10:50:05 <javjarfer__> are you available?
2017-06-28T10:50:11 <stegru> hllo!
2017-06-28T10:50:18 <stegru> only for you
2017-06-28T10:50:23 <javjarfer__> hi! hahahah
2017-06-28T10:52:49 <javjarfer__> Was for talking about how are you managing the native code for the service, and all the security related stuff
2017-06-28T10:53:59 <javjarfer__> it\'s because I\'m packaging everything with https://www.conan.io/ and wanted to know if you are using something similar, or if you are interested
2017-06-28T10:54:00 <stegru> ok
2017-06-28T10:54:55 <javjarfer__> just for having something homogeneous in which we could talk or require all the native code we have
2017-06-28T10:55:30 <javjarfer__> if you think it\'s a good idea to have it
2017-06-28T10:57:14 <stegru> ok well, i have very little native code - it\'s just a native node module
2017-06-28T10:59:11 <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/node-os-service/tree/GPII-2338
2017-06-28T11:00:48 <javjarfer__> ah okay, I see, so it\'s mostly ffi and it\'s already packaged inside the node module no?
2017-06-28T11:00:59 <javjarfer__> then I think it\'s not for this case, thanks you

2017-06-28T12:25:40 <michelled> I think starting with things related to the WP plugin and then going on to things related to UIO in general sounds like a plan

2017-06-28T13:42:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: I was looking into why the prefs editor wasn\'t instantiating. It seems that I had forgotten to include FullNoPreviewPrefsEditor.js
2017-06-28T13:42:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m assuming it wasn\'t giving any errors because of how the builder adds the grades, but i\'m not sure
2017-06-28T13:42:31 <cindyli> ahahah, nooo\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.
2017-06-28T13:43:14 <cindyli> Justin_o: does the editor rendered after you include that js?
2017-06-28T13:44:22 <Justin_o> well no, but it\'s gotten further along. I\'m getting an error now that the resource text is empty when the prefs editor is trying to append its template, but i\'m not getting the creation event console logs for the template and message loaders, so something is still wrong
2017-06-28T13:46:14 * avtar joined the channel
2017-06-28T13:46:36 <cindyli> that\'s nice. at least errors appear :)
2017-06-28T13:46:51 <Justin_o> haha yes, it\'s more helpful that way
2017-06-28T13:48:06 <cindyli> gtirloni: for the-t-in-rtf\'s GPII-2307 pull request, did you have a chance to try the latest change that has the windows fix on linux?
2017-06-28T13:57:56 * kasparne_ has quit
2017-06-28T14:01:13 <gtirloni> cindyli: i tested so many combinations i can\'t remember, let me try
2017-06-28T14:01:40 <gtirloni> cindyli: the error you\'re getting is outside vagrant, it\'s connection reset by peer (just a heads up that creating/destroying the VM won\'t be related)
2017-06-28T14:02:02 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-06-28T14:03:05 <cindyli> gtirloni: ok, thanks. "by peer", who could be this peer?
2017-06-28T14:04:24 <cindyli> the testem? the tunnel script that connects host machine and vagrant?
2017-06-28T14:07:22 <gtirloni> peer in that case means "the other side"
2017-06-28T14:07:32 <gtirloni> many things could come and destroy the connection (node dying, unhandled exception, a firewall, little snitch, antivirus)
2017-06-28T14:07:40 <gtirloni> it\'s hard to say

2017-06-28T14:09:58 <gtirloni> but when you run `test:node`.. it\'s all on OSX, from what i can tell
2017-06-28T14:10:12 <gtirloni> so your installed version of node.js, npm... no port forwarding or Vagrant involved
2017-06-28T14:10:24 <gtirloni> the equivalent inside the VM would be `test:vagrantNode`
2017-06-28T14:15:17 <gtirloni> cindyli: just finished running `npm run test:node` on Linux with node8/npm3 and it worked.. answering your question
2017-06-28T14:17:40 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni. i have node 6 and npm 3

2017-06-28T14:43:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: so intersting development, it seems the issue with resource text is because the loaders are not getting any resources to load. And it seems this may be because the options aren\'t being distributed to the loader components
2017-06-28T14:43:47 <Justin_o> not sure why that is though

2017-06-28T14:45:39 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m thinking, 1. write a simple component with distributeOptions block to find out if that works. this will help to find out if the problem is with the prefs framework or infusion
2017-06-28T14:47:04 <cindyli> 2. try hardcoding the resource text option in one of the loader component to rule out the possibility with the ajax fetch or rendering within chrome extensions
2017-06-28T14:47:10 <Justin_o> The options for the prefs editor itself seem to be distributing fine, the test console log i have is firing
2017-06-28T14:47:47 <Justin_o> and right now i\'m running it straight from my web server, not going through the chrome extension
2017-06-28T14:48:00 <cindyli> right, forgot that
2017-06-28T14:48:28 <Justin_o> the resource options and the listener are in options for the parent, but don\'t show up in the components own options
2017-06-28T14:49:17 <cindyli> weird that some distributions work but not others
2017-06-28T14:49:20 <Justin_o> maybe i\'ll try to modify the manual test in infusion to use the full no preview instead and make sure that it still works
2017-06-28T14:49:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: yah :(
2017-06-28T14:49:46 <cindyli> good point
2017-06-28T14:49:58 <cindyli> to make sure the full no preview still works
2017-06-28T14:50:50 <cindyli> probably write a test html to make sure it still renders
2017-06-28T14:51:16 <cindyli> the old full no preview demo is in the github history, but i guess would be a bit hard to dig it out
2017-06-28T14:56:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: yah, i think i just hack the full with preview manual test page
2017-06-28T15:01:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: so, full no preview works in the manual test
2017-06-28T15:01:21 <cindyli> that\'s great

2017-06-28T15:02:35 <cindyli> only need to figure out that happens with distributions. make sure you are tracking on the correct loader components
2017-06-28T15:04:29 <Justin_o> yep
2017-06-28T15:07:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: I copied over the configuration i had from the extension code, and put it in the same spot, all of the listeners are triggered
2017-06-28T15:07:17 <Justin_o> i guess i\'ll see if i\'m missing anymore dependencies
2017-06-28T15:08:08 <cindyli> ah ha. good progress
2017-06-28T15:10:36 * avtar has quit
2017-06-28T15:11:45 <Justin_o> no missing dependencies, actually it probably has extra ones, but i added those in the same order to the manual test and it doesn\'t make a differencw
2017-06-28T15:11:47 <Justin_o> difference
2017-06-28T15:12:05 <Justin_o> so could be something to do with the concatenated file

2017-06-28T15:19:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, it seems there is something wrong with the concatenated file. I used that in the manual test and am getting the same error

2017-06-28T15:54:30 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: My  standup update. Mostly in meetings yesterday but was looking into adding UIO panel to UIO+ browser extension. Although having  a lot of trouble getting things working. Worked with Cindy on that yesterday and more today. Seems it\'s something to do with missing dependencies and the concatenation of dependencies in the extension. Will continue working on it today. Also reviewed jhung\'s PR. And lastly, no

2017-06-28T16:09:42 <Justin_o> cindyli: the problem seems to have something to do with PrefsEditor.js when it is included in the concatenated file as opposed to being sourced separately
2017-06-28T16:10:23 <cindyli> Justin_o: whoa, very interesting
2017-06-28T16:11:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: yah... i\'ll try to dig into that... seems strange though because that works in our builds
2017-06-28T16:11:16 <cindyli> exactly
2017-06-28T16:14:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: infusion-all works in my other file, so maybe i\'ll just use that instead

2017-06-28T16:22:32 <cindyli> yes
2017-06-28T16:23:19 <Justin_o> yah, i\'m not sure, could be something to do with how it\'s transporting across npm first, or maybe with uglify.. although i made the config similar to infusions, so not sure
