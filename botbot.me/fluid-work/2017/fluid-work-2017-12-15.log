2017-12-15T18:21:50 <simonjb> that\'s great, thanks colinclark, I will make a PR this afternoon
2017-12-15T18:22:10 <simonjb> colinclark: sorry, could you 1 file please?
2017-12-15T18:22:21 <simonjb> it isn\'t possible to fork an empty repo
2017-12-15T18:22:42 <simonjb> maybe add a README or LICENSE
2017-12-15T18:30:10 <michelled> grrrero: yep, call me!
2017-12-15T18:30:57 <simonjb> colinclark: actually, I should be able to add a file, let me see if I can do it
2017-12-15T18:31:14 <colinclark> ah, ok
2017-12-15T18:31:22 <colinclark> i figured you\'d have license and readmes in your PR
2017-12-15T18:31:49 <simonjb> colinclark: yeah, I can just add the license

2017-12-15T12:55:20 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: hahaha love that comment
2017-12-15T12:57:39 <stegru> ;)
2017-12-15T12:58:01 <stegru> i've made a start on the settings handler, javjarfer[m]
2017-12-15T12:58:30 <javjarfer[m]> that is great, if you like we could work together in that
2017-12-15T12:58:43 <javjarfer[m]> have you already pushed something?
2017-12-15T13:00:08 <stegru> well, at the moment i just want to be able to access the c# code from node, so I can test the crashing/leaking
2017-12-15T13:00:44 <stegru> I've just created some empty functions for the settings handler
2017-12-15T13:00:50 <javjarfer[m]> nice, well, at first we will keep the executable outside our process no?
2017-12-15T13:01:06 <javjarfer[m]> or did you change you mind about that?
2017-12-15T13:01:28 <stegru> well, I don't know yet - I'm going to see how it goes
2017-12-15T13:03:47 <stegru> just pushed this.. https://github.com/stegru/windows/commit/a88a0dda2b8627d16f0674427ad72170daadce04
2017-12-15T13:04:04 <stegru> i does nothing, and I haven't ran it
2017-12-15T13:04:09 <stegru> it
2017-12-15T13:07:46 <stegru> that's all i'm going to do for now.. i'm going to see how to integrate the c# stuff - I think i'll keep it all in its own assembly, then either call it using edge, or as a separate process
2017-12-15T13:09:09 <javjarfer[m]> nice, advice me please if there is any part in which I could assist or continue the work
2017-12-15T13:09:13 <stegru> it's too big and ugly to use directly with edge, and it also has to be 64-bit (unless on 32-bit OS) - so I think that could stop us from having it inside node
2017-12-15T13:09:43 <stegru> i don't know yet
2017-12-15T13:10:40 <javjarfer[m]> yes, that sounds like a possible limitation, well, I suppose we will need to wait for the first results of ffi calling
2017-12-15T13:11:25 <stegru> perhaps you could look in the big onboarding spreadsheet, and see if there's a matching system setting
2017-12-15T13:12:46 <javjarfer[m]> a matching system setting for the list you provided to us?
2017-12-15T13:13:04 <stegru> i think so too, but i'm just going to try it anyway.. the DLLs it calls are 64-bit, so the .NET needs to be 64-bit.. and that would mean node needs to be 64-bit
2017-12-15T13:13:10 <stegru> yeh
2017-12-15T13:14:13 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: yes, that could mean that, but well, it's just a matter of trying, I don't know how ffi will handle that
2017-12-15T13:14:49 <stegru> i hope it doesn't work, then I don't need to worry about the memory leaks ;)
2017-12-15T13:14:52 <javjarfer[m]> okay, I will check which settings of which you provided match systems settings we need, I will leave a comment in the issue with that info
2017-12-15T13:15:16 <javjarfer[m]> hahahaha finger crossed

2017-12-15T14:48:30 <simonjb> good morning colinclark, when did you want to chat today?
2017-12-15T14:48:37 <colinclark> hiya
2017-12-15T14:48:47 <colinclark> right after standup?
2017-12-15T14:48:59 <colinclark> I have a 10 am interview for APCP

2017-12-15T14:50:27 <simonjb> cool
2017-12-15T14:50:32 <colinclark> and then possibly flake off for a few hours this afternoon
2017-12-15T14:51:22 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: my suspicion was correct, with the 32/64-bit thing
