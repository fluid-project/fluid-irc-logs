2017-08-22T15:24:45 <gtirloni> michelled: spinning up a new VM for gpii-app to see what's going on.. i have windows box version 2017.07.15 (`vagrant box list`)
2017-08-22T15:25:52 <michelled> thx!
2017-08-22T15:26:05 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-08-22T15:35:13 <grrrero> Justin_o: Should I commit and push?
2017-08-22T15:36:52 <Justin_o> grrrero: yep, you can commit and push up.
2017-08-22T15:38:44 <gmoss> avtar: I'm intrigued by your talk of going to record VO for your videos, as it's something I have an interest in and have tried a few times. maybe we could chat about this a little? :)
2017-08-22T15:41:04 <grrrero> Justin_o: getting this
2017-08-22T15:41:09 <grrrero> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/dxmYnFWu/
2017-08-22T15:41:16 <grrrero> Should I do a git pull first?
2017-08-22T15:41:49 <Justin_o> grrrero: are you pushing it up to a branch called FLUID-5534 or something else?
2017-08-22T15:42:00 <grrrero> FLUID-5534
2017-08-22T15:42:11 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-22T15:42:35 <Justin_o> grrrero: it sounds like your local branch is behind your remote one.. so you could update from the remote branch first, or if there are no useful changes there you can just force push
2017-08-22T15:42:52 <Justin_o> it seems strange that your remote branch is ahead though, are you working on a different machine than before?
2017-08-22T15:43:25 <jhung> avtar: do you have time this afternoon to talk over the introduction to UIO doc?
2017-08-22T15:43:27 <grrrero> Nope same one
2017-08-22T15:44:14 <Justin_o> grrrero: strange, i guess pull down, but make sure it doesn't remove anything that you want to keep
2017-08-22T15:44:53 <michelled> simonjb: can you let alan know that I tried to update the permissions for the SJRK JIRA - he can test it and let me know if it worked
2017-08-22T15:44:58 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think i'll have some time today to pair on the first discovery server issue, would you have a few minutes to look at that with me. If not we can look into it another day
2017-08-22T15:45:12 <avtar> jhung: yup
2017-08-22T15:45:14 <simonjb> will do michelled
2017-08-22T15:45:35 <avtar> jhung: does 1:30 work for you/
2017-08-22T15:45:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: sure. anytime after 1pm is good for me.
2017-08-22T15:46:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, sounds good

2017-08-22T15:52:53 <Justin_o> grrrero: for today, i think you can probably continue working on FLUID-5555, reading infusion docs, and any other work you have on the go. I'll continue on with FLUID-5534 and we can pick it back up together again tomorrow or thursday.
2017-08-22T15:53:19 <grrrero> Ok Justin_o
2017-08-22T15:55:34 <gtirloni> michelled: ok, confirmed tests pass here.. first I would suggest confirming your box is updated (`vagrant box update`), then trying to destroy/recreate the environment if that won't wreck your code (`vagrant destroy -f; vagrant up`) and see if you've recent version of vagrant (1.9.7) and virtualbox (5.1.26)

2017-08-22T17:25:43 <Justin_o> simonjb: you can find the latest work for UIO+ in this PR https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/2
2017-08-22T17:25:55 <Justin_o> it also has information about building and installing the extension
2017-08-22T17:26:08 <simonjb> hey gtirloni and kasparnet, for onboarding of new people, who creates accounts for the gpii wiki and jira?
2017-08-22T17:26:11 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o
2017-08-22T17:27:38 <Justin_o> simonjb: also, you should notice that the behaviour is a bit different now for installing managed plugins. If the extension is present before UIO+ is installed. UIO+ is updated to take the current state of the managed extension. If the managed extension is installed afterwards, it takes the state of the preference from UIO+
2017-08-22T17:28:03 <Justin_o> simonjb: please let me know if you find that behaviour strange or problematic in any way
2017-08-22T17:28:12 <simonjb> will do, thanks Justin_o
2017-08-22T17:28:24 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-08-22T17:30:22 <Justin_o> simonjb: by the way, the build and install process there is mostly about loading an unpacked extension. There are some instructions as well for creating a crx file. Typically though I just use Chrome itself to pack the unpacked extension and create a crx file.
2017-08-22T17:31:00 <Justin_o> but you can just use the unpacked extension for testing purposes
