2017-01-21T00:10:40 <Bosmon> stegru - AAAAGH....... case sensitivity :)
2017-01-21T00:10:43 <Bosmon> Well spotted
2017-01-21T00:11:19 <stegru> i know! the fact that the acceptance tests got it was a fluke
2017-01-21T00:13:52 <Bosmon> Well this is pretty remarkable, isn't it
2017-01-21T00:14:19 <Bosmon> I assumed that either i) the solutions entry for the magnifier, or ii) the acceptance test search code invoked killProcessByName
2017-01-21T00:14:24 <Bosmon> But somehow they don't
2017-01-21T00:14:37 <Bosmon> We still have this manual bullshit for now: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L201
2017-01-21T00:15:42 <Bosmon> Well wait no
2017-01-21T00:15:44 <Bosmon> It's not a fluke!
2017-01-21T00:15:47 <Bosmon> You call this function yourself!
2017-01-21T00:16:29 <Bosmon> Right here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/registeredAT/registeredAT.js#L222
2017-01-21T00:16:42 <Bosmon> This test failure is exactly what is meant to happen, if this function is broken :)
2017-01-21T00:17:16 <stegru> oh yes!
2017-01-21T00:18:32 <Bosmon> Ok, well this is cool
2017-01-21T00:18:42 <Bosmon> At least I can still get this merged in on Friday central time : P
2017-01-21T00:24:14 <stegru> it passed!
