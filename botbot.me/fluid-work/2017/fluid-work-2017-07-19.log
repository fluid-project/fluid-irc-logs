2017-07-19T16:01:21 <cindyli> i have it
2017-07-19T16:01:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, so i guess there\'s something wrong on my end :(
2017-07-19T16:01:42 <Justin_o> but that\'s better than it being broken for everyone

2017-07-19T14:07:53 <Justin_o> voiceover doesn\'t seem to use it at all, and i believe it\'s just for the grouping

2017-07-19T14:10:59 <clown> Justin_o, I\'m not sure what you mean \xe2\x80\x94 is it something like "<input type="radio"  name="foo" value="option 1">  <<input type="radio"  name="foo" value="option 2">"  etc.?
2017-07-19T14:11:50 <clown> If so, the "name" attribute is for the server when the form is submittied.
2017-07-19T14:12:22 <clown> That is, you might send to the server, the name/value pair  "foo/option 2".
2017-07-19T14:12:46 <clown> the name attribute is not supposed to be human readable.
2017-07-19T14:15:41 <Justin_o> clown: cool thanks
2017-07-19T14:16:38 <clown> Justin_o:  okay, I guesss I guessed correctly. :-]
2017-07-19T14:16:52 <Justin_o> clown: you did :) thanks
2017-07-19T14:18:03 <clown> final note:  note that for a radio group, the @name is identical for all radio buttons in the group.  You can think of the group as something called "foo" whose value is THE radio that is selected.
2017-07-19T14:18:23 <clown> which makes @name useless as a "label" for users.
2017-07-19T14:28:33 <Justin_o> clown: great, that\'s what I was expecting, it should make it easier for how i want to work with it

2017-07-19T14:33:56 <Justin_o> avtar: could you send me the instructions for getting a docker web server running
2017-07-19T14:34:08 <Justin_o> also wonder if we should document this on the fluid-wiki
2017-07-19T14:35:31 <kasparnet> gtirloni: hey again
2017-07-19T14:35:42 <kasparnet> so the last part of the vagrant scripts arent working
2017-07-19T14:35:48 <avtar> Justin_o: i shared them via fluid-work
2017-07-19T14:35:51 <kasparnet> i.e. vagrant ci test
2017-07-19T14:35:55 <avtar> http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2017-July/010412.html
2017-07-19T14:36:01 <Justin_o> avtar: thanks
2017-07-19T14:36:05 <avtar> np
2017-07-19T14:36:36 <avtar> creating a wiki page sounds like a good idea
2017-07-19T14:36:56 <avtar> i\'ll figure out the required steps for windows first
2017-07-19T14:37:47 <avtar> although based on what colinclark said, docker requiring hyperv, it might be challenging to achieve the same results in a simple way given how much we rely on virtualbox
2017-07-19T14:38:59 <gtirloni> kasparnet: ok thanks, i\'ll fetch your PR and give it a try here too. thanks for testing
2017-07-19T14:39:21 <avtar> looks like someone could disable hyperv to run virtualbox but restarting their computer is necessary :/ https://derekgusoff.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/run-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-the-same-machine/
2017-07-19T14:42:24 <kasparnet> so kasparnet, that\'s not very helpful feedback... could you paste the output?
2017-07-19T14:42:27 <kasparnet> sure, one sec

2017-07-19T14:46:19 <gtirloni> yeah, that\'s weird. can you check the plugins\' version? vagrant plugin list | grep ci
2017-07-19T14:47:32 <Justin_o> avtar: i don\'t fully understand all that, but it sounds like a bit of drag on windows
2017-07-19T14:47:34 <kasparnet> gtirloni: vagrant-gpii-ci (0.0.6)
2017-07-19T14:47:42 <kasparnet> is the only entry
2017-07-19T14:48:20 <gtirloni> ok cool, thx
2017-07-19T14:49:23 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i find it easier on windows to just have python and run this on the directory you want to share: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999

2017-07-19T15:01:55 <Justin_o> grrrero: good question, we actually have our own font icon set
2017-07-19T15:02:04 <grrrero> Oh awesome! Where do I find
2017-07-19T15:03:38 <Justin_o> there aren\'t too many icons in it at the moment and it\'s also a bit hard to add new ones.
2017-07-19T15:04:15 <Justin_o> we are also considering moving to SVG icons but there is an issue with how we use HTML templates https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6142
2017-07-19T15:05:10 <Justin_o> grrrero: there\'s also an open issue about using a build system for our font icons https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5555

2017-07-19T15:27:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @Bosmon and others.  I remember we discussed intermittent failures in running Infusion tests, I am now consistently getting "cannot look up component type name fluid.textfieldSlider" errors in all browsers.
2017-07-19T15:27:22 <the-t-in-rtf> (I mean in my branch)
2017-07-19T15:28:02 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that\'s pretty interesting
2017-07-19T15:28:32 <Bosmon> What\'s the environment?
2017-07-19T15:28:40 <Bosmon> And you get it in your branch and not in trunk?
2017-07-19T15:28:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Windows Vagrant VM
2017-07-19T15:29:09 <the-t-in-rtf> running from c:/vagrant because v:/ is completely broken.
2017-07-19T15:29:45 <Bosmon> ok
2017-07-19T15:30:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, let me know when there are dev releases to test, I obviously have very many repos that use the v:/ pattern and can test from c:/vagrant as well.
2017-07-19T15:31:39 <gtirloni> kasparnet: i\'ve used a different approach for the production tests: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/530
2017-07-19T15:32:30 <kasparnet> cool
2017-07-19T15:32:46 <kasparnet> I\'ll try merging it with my failing pull and see if things work
2017-07-19T15:32:48 <kasparnet> gtirloni: ^
2017-07-19T15:33:06 <gtirloni> kasparnet: cool, thanks. please remove .vagrant.yml and destroy the existing VM
2017-07-19T15:33:13 <kasparnet> yup

2017-07-19T15:59:57 <Justin_o> i wonder if it\'s just me or if there is something wrong with the mailinglist
