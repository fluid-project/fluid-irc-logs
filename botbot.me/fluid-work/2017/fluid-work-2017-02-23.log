2017-02-23T16:38:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> It\'s been interesting, but I have to drop off for the evening.
2017-02-23T16:39:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> I look forward to seeing the conclusions and the eventual results.

2017-02-23T21:21:06 <colinclark> oh hi avtar
2017-02-23T21:21:31 <alanharnum> avtar: pong
2017-02-23T21:21:58 <avtar> would it be alright if i issue a pr to chartAuthoring that bumps flocking and infusion versions?
2017-02-23T21:22:04 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-02-23T21:22:04 <colinclark> yeah
2017-02-23T21:22:09 <colinclark> you\'ll break it though
2017-02-23T21:22:15 <colinclark> ;)
2017-02-23T21:22:27 <alanharnum> I\'ve just been looking at Colin\'s PR
2017-02-23T21:22:27 <alanharnum> and it all looks OK by me
2017-02-23T21:22:35 <avtar> oh
2017-02-23T21:22:38 <colinclark> cindyli had a comment about it
2017-02-23T21:22:47 <colinclark> I wonder if it\'s worth addressing it or just filing at as an issue for later?
2017-02-23T21:22:49 <alanharnum> yeah, but the demo isn\'t broken; trying to figure out why
2017-02-23T21:22:57 <alanharnum> it looks like infusion-all is being put in both places
2017-02-23T21:23:05 <colinclark> hmm
2017-02-23T21:23:08 <colinclark> you mean, without my PR?
2017-02-23T21:23:21 <alanharnum> i\'m taking a look right now form a clean install
2017-02-23T21:23:23 <colinclark> cool
2017-02-23T21:23:27 <colinclark> perhaps I was just terribly confused
2017-02-23T21:23:35 <colinclark> but when I followed your readme, I saw a demo with no styling
2017-02-23T21:23:36 <cindyli> alanharnum: you do need a clean install to break it
2017-02-23T21:23:56 <alanharnum> cindyli: yeah, I think I\'ve got old stuff hanging around
2017-02-23T21:23:59 <colinclark> hey it\'s cindyli
2017-02-23T21:24:09 <alanharnum> I will open a new PR from colinclark\'s PR once I fix these issues
2017-02-23T21:24:12 <colinclark> I mean, my sense is that cindyli\'s comment was correct
2017-02-23T21:24:20 <alanharnum> I\'ll also see if it can be upgraded to newest Infusion per Bosmon\'s request
2017-02-23T21:24:22 <colinclark> that i was being rather haphazard in what i chose to copy
2017-02-23T21:24:24 <alanharnum> and we can hopefully finally close this
2017-02-23T21:24:31 <colinclark> that\'d be amazing alanharnum
2017-02-23T21:24:51 <alanharnum> it\'s a good end of day task for me because it\'s not very complicated :p

2017-02-23T21:54:24 <colinclark> nicely done, alanharnum
2017-02-23T21:54:26 <alanharnum> i did something that i should have done when i first wrote the build scripts and added a "clean" function to the install process that wipes out the directories dependencies get copied into
2017-02-23T21:54:33 <Bosmon> Oh hey guys :)
2017-02-23T21:54:44 <alanharnum> this will hopefully avoid future "it works on my local lol" issues :(
2017-02-23T21:55:51 <Bosmon> Hi simonjb - I suggest you consult the-t-in-rtf work in progress on the "client-side dataSource" ....
2017-02-23T21:56:15 <simonjb> will do, thanks Bosmon

2017-02-23T22:38:14 <colinclark> oh Bosmon, I was just looking at your notes regarding UIA and Nexus
2017-02-23T22:38:23 <colinclark> aside from just generally being excited about the idea
2017-02-23T22:39:04 <colinclark> I can tell you that the comment on line 19 is consistent with my last visit to the Seattle area
2017-02-23T22:39:55 <colinclark> and I wouldn\'t be surprised if line 20 gets resolved via additional funding
2017-02-23T22:42:27 <Bosmon> colinclark - that\'s very interesting

2017-02-23T14:28:32 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf1: Bosmon noticed gpii-pouchdb cleanup still leaves behind some db fles in the temp dir on windows - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/503#issuecomment-281877293. seems those db files were in lock state at the execution of unlink
2017-02-23T14:31:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s right, yes
2017-02-23T14:32:42 <Bosmon> javjarfer - that\'s a pretty scary list :)
2017-02-23T14:34:18 <Bosmon> Yes, we currently have a very bulky rule using fluid.transforms.valueMapper but clearly this isn\'t optimal
2017-02-23T14:34:41 <Bosmon> These language mappings should be in a dedicated JSON file operated by some dedicated transform

2017-02-23T14:39:09 * alanhar__ joined the channel
2017-02-23T14:42:42 <javjarfer> Bosmon, that looks a lot more practical, is any way of doing it actually?
2017-02-23T14:42:54 <javjarfer> or should I include it in a match transform for now?
2017-02-23T14:43:01 <Bosmon> javjarfer - sure, it\'s easy - any arbitrary function can be used as a transform :)
2017-02-23T14:45:34 <Bosmon> I guess the docs are not completely clear
2017-02-23T14:45:42 <Bosmon> And kaspernet doesn\'t seem to be here today to blame for them : P
2017-02-23T14:45:45 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#standardinputtransformfunction
2017-02-23T14:47:09 <Bosmon> Other than fluid.transforms.free, there isn\'t any section on how to write a new transform rule
2017-02-23T14:47:34 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - you did this a bit, did you just puzzle it out for yourself?
2017-02-23T14:47:44 <Bosmon> Or did you light upon anything resembling docs on the subject
2017-02-23T14:48:36 <javjarfer> Bosmon, thanks for the docs I\'m going to take a look at them
2017-02-23T14:49:11 <javjarfer> this would be necessary in order not to have that tremendous list in the SR
2017-02-23T14:49:29 <Bosmon> That would be a brilliant improvement
2017-02-23T14:49:36 <Bosmon> Since I am constantly seeing it scroll by on my terminal :)
2017-02-23T14:50:39 <Bosmon> The missing bit in the docs would say "A transformation is implemented by a global function with the following signature: Function: (inputValue[, transformSpec, transformer) -> outputValue
2017-02-23T14:50:42 <Bosmon> "
2017-02-23T14:51:47 <Bosmon> Where transformSpec is the Object corresponding to the transform\'s entry in its host configuration document, and transformer is a reference to the implementation of the transformation engine itself which is sometimes useful during complex operations

2017-02-23T15:00:41 <javjarfer> Bosmon, thanks for the explanation, I think now I have a better picture, lets see when trying to actually implement this xD

2017-02-23T15:02:08 <gtirloni> Bosmon: they are standalone, not connected to ocad\'s ID system. i can create javjarfer one account, i\'ll email the details
2017-02-23T15:02:11 <jhernandez> gtirloni: since Alfredo is travelling ... may I ask you a favour? The other day Alfredo set the timeout in CI to 60 mins (gpii-app takes ~45 mins to pass CI)
2017-02-23T15:02:17 <the-t-in-rtf1> @bosmon @javjarfer, I had always intended to write a tutorial.
2017-02-23T15:02:22 <Bosmon> gtirloni - that will be brilliant, thanks
2017-02-23T15:02:25 <the-t-in-rtf1> But haven\'t.
2017-02-23T15:02:26 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - also brilliant :)

2017-02-23T15:02:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> Well, I\'m not sure, your comments on my array-processing transform made me think there is some fundamental thing I don\'t quite get yet.
2017-02-23T15:03:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> Let me dig that up.
2017-02-23T15:03:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyway, where are we meeting?
2017-02-23T15:03:11 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-02-23T15:03:14 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - on the NECKSUS?
2017-02-23T15:03:17 <jhernandez> gtirloni: today I\'ve triggered a build and it\'s being aborted at 25 mins - is it because the timeout is set again to 25 mins?
2017-02-23T15:03:28 <Bosmon> Great it\'s simonjb :)
2017-02-23T15:03:40 <simonjb> HEY
2017-02-23T15:03:46 <Bosmon> Well, I think there\'s a scheme for inviting people to a VIDDYO meeting via a URL right?
2017-02-23T15:04:03 <Bosmon> So we don\'t need to wait for javjarfer\'s account to be set up right away
2017-02-23T15:04:19 <javjarfer> the-t-in-rft1, that would be awome. Thanks gtirloni!
2017-02-23T15:04:24 <javjarfer> awesome**
2017-02-23T15:04:27 <the-t-in-rtf1> Simon\'s room?
2017-02-23T15:04:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> guess not, it\'s locked.
2017-02-23T15:04:42 <gtirloni> jhernandez: probably, if alfredo didn\'t change the ci-service repo (and edited it by hand).. let me check that (in a meeting now, but i\'ll reply in a moment)
2017-02-23T15:04:43 <simonjb> I can unlock
2017-02-23T15:04:50 <alanharnum> beaten by gtirloni on the account, but to Bosmon\'s question - yes, you should be able to just send an invite link and javjarfer can join as a guest
2017-02-23T15:05:08 <Bosmon> Cool - how do we get the URL of the invite link?
2017-02-23T15:05:18 <simonjb> I\'ve unlocked my room, if we want to meet there
2017-02-23T15:05:27 <simonjb> or Bosmon, did you want to meet in your room?
2017-02-23T15:05:38 <Bosmon> Ah, I didn\'t know I had a room
2017-02-23T15:05:42 <Bosmon> Let\'s meet in simonjb\'s room :)
2017-02-23T15:06:05 <jhernandez> gtirloni: okay, thanks
2017-02-23T15:06:13 <Bosmon> For anyone else who is interested, we will be chatting about javjarfer\'s potential use of the NEXUS for enabling UNIVERSAL ACCESSIBILITY by means of the Microsoft "UI Automation API"
2017-02-23T15:07:22 <alanharnum> Bosmon: someone who\'s logged into the room should have an invite button or similar (I am sorry for being extremely vague)
2017-02-23T15:07:29 <Bosmon> ok I will look for it
2017-02-23T15:07:36 <Bosmon> The Vidyo UI always perplexed me
2017-02-23T15:10:09 <Bosmon> alanharnum - we are struggling to find the link
2017-02-23T15:11:38 <alanharnum> Bosmon: let me see
2017-02-23T15:12:39 <shivam_ogway> Justin_o, Thanks for the prompt response. GSoC, I\'m new to that. And I\'m really glad to hear about this wonderful opportunity also. However, My main objective will be to learn and contribute as much as possible. Thanks again. :)

2017-02-23T16:13:39 <colinclark> alanhar__, alanharn_: Morning! I hope you\'re feeling better.
2017-02-23T16:14:05 <jhernandez> simonjb, Bosmon, javjarfer, clown the-t-in-rtf1 Vidyo has decided to stop working and now it says that my credentials aren\'t valid
2017-02-23T16:14:07 <jhernandez> :/
2017-02-23T16:14:24 <simonjb> :(
2017-02-23T16:14:41 <simonjb> still fine for us, are you able to re-join?
2017-02-23T16:14:48 <clown> well, you are a suspicious character, jhernandez
2017-02-23T16:14:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> It\'s like highlander, there can be only one Javi.
2017-02-23T16:14:54 <simonjb> ha
2017-02-23T16:14:58 <jhernandez> haha
2017-02-23T16:15:34 <clown> or, vidyo has decided that meetings shouldn\'t go over an hour in duration.

2017-02-23T16:29:50 <jhernandez> gtirloni: Build timed out (after 25 minutes). Marking the build as failed.
2017-02-23T16:30:55 <jhernandez> gtirloni: https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-06/24/19/campaign_images/webdr09/this-may-be-this-cutest-saddest-cat-ever-2-4626-1435188004-0_dblbig.jpg
2017-02-23T16:31:34 <gtirloni> oh, so one step in the build takes more than 25min, not the whole thing.. sorry, i set it for the whole job. let me change that
2017-02-23T16:34:05 <jhernandez> gtirloni: heh, okay, that was my impression - that there are different timeout limits
2017-02-23T16:35:38 <jhernandez> but still I\'m curious, the console log says "all tests concluded. Exiting process.." ant then, it times out
2017-02-23T16:35:46 <jhernandez> https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/11/console
2017-02-23T16:36:08 <gtirloni> that\'s weird
2017-02-23T16:36:26 <gtirloni> in any case, i have set the whole job to timeout=120 and the build/test phases to 60min each
2017-02-23T16:36:46 <jhernandez> yeah, why all these CI weird things happen always to me?
2017-02-23T16:36:46 <gtirloni> maybe `npm test` is not returning? i\'d have to run it here manually and se
2017-02-23T16:36:48 <gtirloni> see
2017-02-23T16:36:54 <jhernandez> okay
2017-02-23T16:37:26 <jhernandez> so far, Kasper and I have tested it manually and everything "looks fine"
2017-02-23T16:37:38 <gtirloni> ok
2017-02-23T16:38:07 <jhernandez> but yeah, it may be npm test not returning there
