b"2017-02-15T17:31:19 <jhernandez> it works better on linux than in mac
2017-02-15T17:31:24 <jhernandez> xD
2017-02-15T17:31:37 <gtirloni> something has to work better on linux for once!!11
2017-02-15T17:31:41 <gtirloni> hehehe
2017-02-15T17:31:43 <jhernandez> haha
2017-02-15T17:31:45 <jhernandez> yes
2017-02-15T17:32:29 <kasparnet> sgithens: we WILL have that - a central location for common terms
2017-02-15T17:32:44 <Caren> danayo I just need to be away from my desk for an hour (2-3EST)
2017-02-15T17:35:13 <kasparnet> sgithens: Information on application specific settings will (for now anyway) live in the solutions registry under each application such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L20
2017-02-15T17:35:58 <sgithens> kasparnet: Aha!  awesome, thanks.  I completely missed us adding that block to the solutions registry
2017-02-15T17:36:01 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-02-15T17:36:10 <kasparnet> sgithens: it's quite new
2017-02-15T17:36:16 <sgithens> I will totally parse that
2017-02-15T17:36:24 <kasparnet> just itching for someone like you to come along and fill it with metadata
2017-02-15T17:36:30 <sgithens> kasparnet: Where do you suppose we would put human friendly metadata for that?
2017-02-15T17:36:34 <sgithens> oh
2017-02-15T17:36:37 <sgithens> in the hashes
2017-02-15T17:36:46 <kasparnet> yes
2017-02-15T17:36:50 <sgithens> do you have a format for what goes in the hashes ?
2017-02-15T17:37:12 <kasparnet> nope -- but I think jhernandez compiled a list of relevant metadata needed for something like the PCP
2017-02-15T17:37:15 <kasparnet> in a document somewhere
2017-02-15T17:37:19 <sgithens> awesome
2017-02-15T17:38:44 <jhernandez> sgithens: would you say that this https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Personal_Control_Panel_API#Settings.27_Metadata is what you were looking for?
2017-02-15T17:39:41 <sgithens> I think so yeah
2017-02-15T17:39:43 <jhernandez> sgithens: I did send a mail to the arch list asking for feedback just in case you have some ideas
2017-02-15T17:39:51 <kasparnet> jhernandez, sgithens: On the WIKI!!! We're so f***ing open source right now
2017-02-15T17:40:10 <sgithens> jhernandez: you might want a description field as well?
2017-02-15T17:41:02 <sgithens> like if it's a specific RWG setting, the Application would just describe RWG I assume, but you might want a description of the setting specifically
2017-02-15T17:41:11 <sgithens> even if it's just a link to the documentation or something
2017-02-15T17:41:21 <jhernandez> sgithens: why not, in that page I was only thinking of the context of the PCP API, but yes, it makees sense to me
2017-02-15T17:41:47 <sgithens> Can I add description to the list?
2017-02-15T17:45:47 <sgithens> jhernandez I added it to the list
2017-02-15T17:45:56 <sgithens> thx!
2017-02-15T17:46:12 <jhernandez> sgithens: sure!
2017-02-15T17:46:16 <jhernandez> thanks to you
2017-02-15T17:46:52 <gloob> gtirloni: mine is jabra, use jabra link
2017-02-15T17:47:08 <gloob> gtirloni: if you use bt is crap because the !bidirectionality issue
2017-02-15T17:47:13 <jhernandez> sgithens: this was one of the things I was a bit worried about, who would start including all this metadata? and then you appeared!! :)
2017-02-15T17:47:47 <sgithens> I felt a tug from the ether and knew that you were summoning me for this!
2017-02-15T17:48:23 <gtirloni> gloob: got it..i was trying to find out if BT 5.1 would fix that but i'm not confident
2017-02-15T17:48:36 <jhernandez> sgithens: heh!
2017-02-15T17:49:34 <jhernandez> sgithens: btw, if you happen to create a jira for this, link it with this one https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2136
2017-02-15T17:49:55 <sgithens> jhernandez: Will do
2017-02-15T17:50:05 <jhernandez> thanks

2017-02-15T18:08:49 <jhernandez> stegru: yes, and IIRC I already did it - let me check
2017-02-15T18:08:55 <stegru> oh
2017-02-15T18:09:34 <stegru> no.. and it's pointing to michelle's repo.. want me to point it at the hst instead?
2017-02-15T18:09:43 <stegru> https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/pull/4
2017-02-15T18:10:04 <jhernandez> no worries, it's already there
2017-02-15T18:10:06 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/commit/48f432bc9f91073f87acd7eb0af956b408fcbda3
2017-02-15T18:10:43 <stegru> ahh ok!
2017-02-15T18:11:35 <jhernandez> since it also applies to master I think it's just fine to leave it like it is right now
2017-02-15T18:12:12 <stegru> ok

2017-02-15T15:15:08 <jhernandez> cindyli: yes
2017-02-15T15:15:21 <cindyli> jhernandez: do you still have the source file for it?
2017-02-15T15:16:46 <jhernandez> yes
2017-02-15T15:16:48 <cindyli> i\'m collecting and placing source files for our recent diagrams to a github repo
2017-02-15T15:16:54 <jhernandez> it was done with draw.io
2017-02-15T15:17:04 <jhernandez> all them are in a google doc folder
2017-02-15T15:17:17 <cindyli> jhernandez: can you send a pull request to this branch with that source file - https://github.com/cindyli/gpii-architecture-docs/tree/GPII-2164
2017-02-15T15:17:49 <cindyli> jhernandez: if there were other files, feel free to include in ur pull request
2017-02-15T15:19:04 <jhernandez> cindyli: sure, what are your preferences on file format?
2017-02-15T15:19:38 <cindyli> jhernandez: the editable version, not jpg or png
2017-02-15T15:19:44 <jhernandez> I\'m asking that because draw.io doesn\'t have source files, you just create your diagrams online and you can get them in different ways
2017-02-15T15:19:59 <cindyli> oh, i see, you create then export
2017-02-15T15:20:04 * kasparnet has quit
2017-02-15T15:20:20 <jhernandez> ok, then I assume svg could be the best one
2017-02-15T15:21:26 <cindyli> jhernandez: if svg is exported from draw.io, can you import it back into draw.io to edit
2017-02-15T15:21:40 <jhernandez> that\'s what I\'m checking right now
2017-02-15T15:21:42 <jhernandez> :)
2017-02-15T15:22:13 <cindyli> google tells: Use an SVG editor - that would be Illustrator or Inkscape.
2017-02-15T15:23:39 <jhernandez> you can import it back into draw.io, just checked it
2017-02-15T15:24:44 <cindyli> cool. thanks, jhernandez. can you send me the link to that google doc folder so i can try it out
2017-02-15T15:24:56 <jhernandez> sure
2017-02-15T15:26:38 <jhernandez> there you\'ll find the draw.io "file" and the pdf version of it
2017-02-15T15:28:35 <cindyli> got it. thanks, jhernandez

2017-02-15T16:10:40 <kasparnet> been debugging it with Javi
2017-02-15T16:10:52 <kasparnet> and there is the issue(s) pending he mentioned in gotomeeting

2017-02-15T16:40:36 * yzen has quit
2017-02-15T16:40:58 <jhernandez> Bosmon: we mainly have 2 issues
2017-02-15T16:41:47 <jhernandez> 1. We\'re not building stegru\'s test-window during the provisioning/build stage - so the tests fail
2017-02-15T16:42:03 <jhernandez> 2. We can\'t run certain windows tests because they depend on shelljs
2017-02-15T16:42:34 <jhernandez> (and since shelljs is a devDep of windows, is not being installed from within gpii-app when running npm install)
2017-02-15T16:43:24 <jhernandez> for 1, gloob and I are going to take a look at the best efficient way to fix it
2017-02-15T16:44:19 <jhernandez> for 2, we can just add shelljs as a devDep of gpii-app, but technically, it isn\'t a devDep of gpii-app
2017-02-15T16:44:38 <jhernandez> do you know what I mean?
2017-02-15T16:44:40 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2017-02-15T16:47:59 <Bosmon> jhernandez - perfectly reasonable to add shelljs as a devDep
2017-02-15T16:48:13 <Bosmon> As is well known, the npm "devDependencies" model is utterly broken
2017-02-15T16:48:29 <jhernandez> yeah
2017-02-15T16:49:45 <Bosmon> And as for 1. I believe that gloob was looking at refactoring those .ps1 build scripts anyway
2017-02-15T16:51:38 <jhernandez> yes, but it\'s also true that it\'ll take some more time since he wants to refactor them properly and what we currently have for hst is something "in the middle"
2017-02-15T16:51:55 <jhernandez> but yeah, nothing hard to fix

2017-02-15T17:15:00 <alanharnum> jhung danayo: was talking to colinclark after the standup and the thought was that we should postpone talking about curation for Bodies in Translation due to jhung\'s conflict
2017-02-15T17:15:24 <alanharnum> is that correct colinclark?
2017-02-15T17:15:35 * avtar joined the channel
2017-02-15T17:16:51 <jhung> alanharnum: that would help. My meeting is from 1p to 2p.
2017-02-15T17:17:21 <alanharnum> jhung: OK - so let\'s assume we\'ll meet later on this
2017-02-15T17:17:27 <alanharnum> ^ danayo colinclark
2017-02-15T17:17:37 <danayo> ok alanharnum, jhung, colinclark
2017-02-15T17:18:21 <jhung> thanks!
2017-02-15T17:18:56 <danayo> jhung, alanharnum, Caren, colinclark : any chance we could meet some time today to discuss accessible prototyping options (for privacy project)?
2017-02-15T17:20:00 <colinclark> I might actually be booked solid, but let me double check
2017-02-15T17:20:51 * Caren joined the channel
2017-02-15T17:24:27 <gtirloni> jhernandez gloob: your BT headsets.. do you know if they are BT 4.1 or something like that? my sounds so horrible i never use it for calls
2017-02-15T17:25:06 <gtirloni> it sounds like i\'m riding a convertible car in Italy with the sea by my side
2017-02-15T17:25:13 <gtirloni> but without any of that, just the bad mic
2017-02-15T17:26:17 <jhernandez> gtirloni: honestly, I don\'t know whether they\'re BT 4.1 or not
2017-02-15T17:26:55 <jhernandez> it\'s a sony mdr zx330bt
2017-02-15T17:27:47 <jhernandez> for some reason I\'m not able to use the mic and a2dp audio
2017-02-15T17:28:19 <jhernandez> so I use a2dp audio and I use the laptop\'s built-in mic
2017-02-15T17:28:24 <jhernandez> :/
2017-02-15T17:28:49 <gtirloni> ah, that\'s it then.. the laptop\'s mic
2017-02-15T17:29:08 <jhernandez> yes
2017-02-15T17:29:09 <gtirloni> the \'hands-free\' audio profile, which is the only thing my headset supports for the mic, it\'s like 4-bit audio
2017-02-15T17:29:10 <jhung> danayo: today\'s pretty packed for me.
2017-02-15T17:29:21 <gtirloni> jhernandez: and it\'s the same here.. a2dp won\'t work with the mic
2017-02-15T17:29:55 <jhernandez> blame <insert your kernel/pulseaudio/whatever developer here>
2017-02-15T17:29:56 <jhung> I\'m free tomorrow danayo if that works. Otherwise I can catch up with you all later
2017-02-15T17:30:07 <gtirloni> ok thanks, just wanted to check if i should put my hopes in buying a different headset
2017-02-15T17:30:10 <jhernandez> gtirloni: :)
2017-02-15T17:30:36 <jhernandez> other than that, it does all the work with my android device
2017-02-15T17:31:10 <jhernandez> and funny thing, he doesn\'t like playing with mac
2017-02-15T17:31:12 <jhernandez> :)
2017-02-15T17:31:18 <gtirloni> O_o
