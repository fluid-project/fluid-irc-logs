b"2017-11-07T20:17:51 <Bosmon> I only ever found out about it because the sister of a friend of my wife had attended a small talk given by their local BATTE preservation society ....
2017-11-07T20:19:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i suppose people can experience/benefit from it in other ways, but there is also something poignant about necessitated isolation.
2017-11-07T20:19:10 <Bosmon> But this thing is clearly one of the highest goods available to society, and it most definitely doesn't scale, unless it were just left alone for 1000 years to scale by itself :)
2017-11-07T20:19:55 <Bosmon> Yes, it would be nice to think about ways people could experience or benefit from such things without destroying them
2017-11-07T20:20:04 <Bosmon> And perhaps tomorrow's community meeting will start to touch on such issues
2017-11-07T20:20:16 <Justin_o> ah how fitting
2017-11-07T20:20:44 <Justin_o> that's a brilliant segue

2017-11-07T21:00:15 <Justin_o> simonjb: i want to compare some model values, Bosmon suggested that I use https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L1537
2017-11-07T21:00:20 <Justin_o> to get the changes
2017-11-07T21:01:05 <Justin_o> However, I want to compare a model against a portion of a model.. that is a model against a path in another model
2017-11-07T21:03:12 <danayo> does it look like this, Bosmon? https://theredlist.com/media/database/photography/contemporaine/landscape/tim-simmons/001-tim-simmons-theredlist.png
2017-11-07T21:03:43 <Justin_o> simonjb: if i'm understanding things correctly, I'll pass in the full model, and the portion of the model as arguments and then use changePathPrefix if i want to apply it back to the larger model
2017-11-07T21:05:04 <simonjb> yes Justin_o, I believe that should work
2017-11-07T21:06:33 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2017-11-07T21:06:35 <simonjb> Justin_o: if you try it, let me know if you have issues but I think it sounds like fluid.modelPairToChanges should do what you need
2017-11-07T21:06:46 <Justin_o> thanks, will do

2017-11-07T18:21:03 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: ^
2017-11-07T18:26:45 <mrtyler> colinclark: cool speech. thx for sharing
2017-11-07T18:26:59 <mrtyler> re: the section on "users DO know":
2017-11-07T18:27:08 <colinclark> oh thanks, mrtyler
2017-11-07T18:27:36 <mrtyler> what is your response to the infamous (and apparently apocryphal) henry ford quote, \'If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\'
2017-11-07T18:28:24 <mrtyler> put another way, while i agree with you that users should be much more included in design processes, isn\'t it true that big innovations sometimes come from ignoring what users "want"?
2017-11-07T18:28:39 <mrtyler> we also don\'t have to get into this now / here :)
2017-11-07T18:28:44 <mrtyler> just something i thought of while reading
2017-11-07T18:30:27 <danayo> mrtyler: did Henry Ford ever actually ask? Or is he a mind reader? :)
2017-11-07T18:30:32 <danayo> *was he
2017-11-07T18:30:55 <mrtyler> danayo: heh. the quote is apparenty aprocryphal, so it\'s especially hard to speculate :)
2017-11-07T18:31:13 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-11-07T18:31:22 <colinclark> mrtyler, it\'s a great question
2017-11-07T18:31:25 <mrtyler> however i suspect that most of his users would not have said "i want a horse, only it\'s a machine..."
2017-11-07T18:31:55 <colinclark> I think part of my point is that we should see "users" in a broader context
2017-11-07T18:31:56 <mrtyler> danayo: are you implying that a more user-focused design session might have unearthed the market for automobiles?
2017-11-07T18:32:04 <colinclark> to be inclusive of the communities that people live and work in
2017-11-07T18:32:29 <colinclark> and that there are ways we can better engage and activate people within the design process
2017-11-07T18:32:41 * jhung joined the channel
2017-11-07T18:32:42 <mrtyler> i definitely agree with all that
2017-11-07T18:32:53 <colinclark> to bring out the somewhat discontinuous relationship, which I think you\'re pointing out here, between need and innovation
2017-11-07T18:33:13 <colinclark> identifying a need, or a concern, doesn\'t necessarily in itself produce some new innovation
2017-11-07T18:33:28 <colinclark> it\'s just the first step
2017-11-07T18:33:45 <colinclark> in fact, I guess part of my point with co-design is that you don\'t just go ask
2017-11-07T18:34:01 <colinclark> you let them in on your process of experimentation and design
2017-11-07T18:34:50 * kavyva has quit
2017-11-07T18:35:50 <colinclark> I guess that\'s the key with the Henry Ford quote, or Cooper\'s method
2017-11-07T18:36:29 <colinclark> they assume that the only kind of interaction they can have with people is to ask them once, at the start
2017-11-07T18:36:44 <colinclark> and that, presumably, really will always produce a unsatisfying result
2017-11-07T18:36:58 <colinclark> If that makes any sense?
2017-11-07T18:37:21 <mrtyler> totally
2017-11-07T18:37:29 <mrtyler> i sense that\'s what dana was getting at as well
2017-11-07T18:37:40 <colinclark> yup
2017-11-07T18:37:45 <colinclark> interestingly, imagine back then
2017-11-07T18:38:05 <colinclark> I\'m being quite specific, in this context, of the uniquely self-aware knowledge that people with disabilities have
2017-11-07T18:38:11 <colinclark> so someone who was systemically unable to ride a horse
2017-11-07T18:38:34 <colinclark> might well have suggested that some method of machine propulsion of four wheels made sense to them :)
2017-11-07T18:38:44 <mrtyler> interesting
2017-11-07T18:39:14 <colinclark> I do think this point generalizes to anyone
2017-11-07T18:39:21 <colinclark> but it\'s just easier to see if we look at the "marginal" cases
2017-11-07T18:39:33 * javjarfer joined the channel
2017-11-07T18:39:39 <colinclark> like someone who\'s access to a traditional horse and carriage was already problematic
2017-11-07T18:39:52 <mrtyler> right. diversity of thought (or whatever) is always good, but most noticeable with *radical* diversity of thought (or whatever)
2017-11-07T18:40:25 <colinclark> yup, that\'s right
2017-11-07T18:41:23 <mrtyler> well cool. thx for the responses :)

2017-11-07T19:43:07 <danayo> mrtyler: colinclark: sorry I dropped out just catching up on earlier discussion - appreciate your point colinclark about not just asking once
2017-11-07T19:43:43 <danayo> I also can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think - maybe the technology would have gone in a completely different direction. Who knows, but maybe we could have imagined and innovated something EVEN BETTER
2017-11-07T19:49:23 <colinclark> yes
2017-11-07T19:50:07 <colinclark> I mean, it\'s hard to see the scale of the impact on the environment of the automobile, relative to a horse, as a genuine innovation :)
2017-11-07T19:54:42 <Justin_o> colinclark: i hear that horses were bad for the environment at the time. Their waste was causing diseases in the towns/cities or something like that.
2017-11-07T19:54:43 <Justin_o> https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597276/google-ai-image-attacks-adversarial-turtle-rifle-3d-printed
2017-11-07T19:54:51 <Justin_o> sorry, wrong link, although that one is also intersting
2017-11-07T19:54:57 <Justin_o> https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/when-horses-posed-a-public-health-hazard/
2017-11-07T19:55:02 <colinclark> Justin_o, right, but the word "scale" in my previous point is key
2017-11-07T19:55:32 <mrtyler> danayo: yeah, we could have proto-Teslas! :)
2017-11-07T19:55:51 <mrtyler> but i think colin and i sussed out your meaning after you left
2017-11-07T19:56:07 <mrtyler> this also makes me think of hill-climber algorithms
2017-11-07T19:56:08 <danayo> exactly colinclark!
2017-11-07T19:56:25 <danayo> mrtyler: yes :)
2017-11-07T19:56:37 <danayo> to proto-Teslas
2017-11-07T19:56:43 <mrtyler> and how they are good at finding a local maximum (incremental improvement, "faster horses"), but require more sophistication to find a global maximum (innovative leap, cars over horses)
2017-11-07T19:57:08 * amatas has quit
2017-11-07T19:57:18 <mrtyler> and then there are psychological effects of knowing a lot about a domain and so throwing out "impossible" solutions
2017-11-07T19:57:29 <mrtyler> vs a less experienced user who is not constrained by what the system "can\'t" do
2017-11-07T19:57:49 <mrtyler> anyway it\'s an interesting space :)
2017-11-07T19:59:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: not saying that cars are necessarily better than horses, but that the solution to one problem created another. it\'s kind of interesting to explore/think about from that perspective.
2017-11-07T20:00:13 <colinclark> right, that\'s a good point
2017-11-07T20:00:19 <colinclark> but again, don\'t forget the idea of scale
2017-11-07T20:00:50 <colinclark> to what extent can a solution scale so large, so "successfuly" that the problems it creates become intractable
2017-11-07T20:01:10 <colinclark> and to what extent is the scale of a "solution" proportional to the problems it is constituted by
2017-11-07T20:01:55 <colinclark> Paul Virilio talks about this in regards to new technologies always bringing with them the invention of whole new kinds of accidents
2017-11-07T20:02:18 <colinclark> which I think might be your point too\xe2\x80\x94solutions cause different kinds of problems
2017-11-07T20:03:23 <colinclark> What\'s interesting about someone like, say, Ivan Illich (whether you agree or not) is that he points that larger-, higher-scaling technologies have significantly greater impact on communities
2017-11-07T20:03:51 * mrtyler has quit
2017-11-07T20:04:42 <Justin_o> meaning they have the potential for more good or bad?
2017-11-07T20:07:05 <colinclark> I\'m not sure about the framing of "good" and "bad" in such clear-cut ways, personally
2017-11-07T20:07:12 <colinclark> but I think Illich would say "bad"
2017-11-07T20:08:13 * kasparnet has quit
2017-11-07T20:08:22 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-11-07T20:08:33 <Bosmon> I believe that Il\'yich would actually argue that scaling itself represents an intrinsic ill
2017-11-07T20:08:56 <Bosmon> Which is somewhat at odds with what most of us temperamentally believe (at least speaking for myself : P)
2017-11-07T20:09:23 <Bosmon> But one can certainly see his point
2017-11-07T20:10:19 <Bosmon> Those of us with a remnant utilitarianism would say, "How on earth could we expect to have substantial beneficial impacts on society without being able to scale them?"
2017-11-07T20:10:44 <colinclark> I guess that\'s what communities are for :)
2017-11-07T20:11:48 <Bosmon> I think he has no problem with the scaling of "ideas and information" - he\'s uncharacteristically mild on developments such as the Internet (at least of the 90s when he was actively writing), and clearly he liked to write and publish books
2017-11-07T20:11:55 * kasparnet has quit
2017-11-07T20:12:16 <Bosmon> But I think that anything that has a direct economic scaling, to him, represents an inherent ill
2017-11-07T20:12:36 <colinclark> I think Illich\'s concern is the scale of industrial mechanization and automation
2017-11-07T20:12:41 <Bosmon> I guess there\'s a lot of evidence in favour of that view
2017-11-07T20:12:52 <Bosmon> As I visited the ANCIENT ANCIENT forest on Sunday
2017-11-07T20:12:58 <colinclark> since these often represent large-scale systems coupled to larger-scale systems
2017-11-07T20:12:59 <Bosmon> I could see very little we could do for it other than leave it alone
2017-11-07T20:13:06 <Bosmon> And perhaps, occasionally count the BATTES that live in it
2017-11-07T20:13:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: which forest is this?
2017-11-07T20:13:47 <Bosmon> The curators of the wood are just trying, as far as I can see, to make sure it is left alone even more actively than it has been for the last 10,000 years
2017-11-07T20:14:01 <Bosmon> Given they are growing a dense mass of brush in front of it that will render it impenetrable to casual visitors
2017-11-07T20:14:17 * alanharnum has quit
2017-11-07T20:14:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I visited this one

2017-11-07T20:14:32 <Bosmon> It was quite an experience
2017-11-07T20:14:43 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-07T20:14:44 <simonjb> I like this idea of actively leaving something alone
2017-11-07T20:14:50 * alanharnum has quit
2017-11-07T20:14:54 <Bosmon> Since I understood for the first time what the natural terrain and ecology of Britain actually looks like
2017-11-07T20:14:56 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-07T20:15:06 <Bosmon> I had *thought* I knew, since I grew up next to a "scheduled ancient woodland"
2017-11-07T20:15:38 <Bosmon> But as it turns out there is a significant difference between an ecosystem which has merely been left alone for about 500 years and one which has been mostly left alone since the last Ice Age
2017-11-07T20:16:27 <simonjb> I image that there is very little of the British Isles that has been left alone for more than 500 years
2017-11-07T20:16:56 <Bosmon> But there\'s a huge paradox here.... noone will ever discover such a thing, precisely because it is so rare and precious : P

2017-11-07T14:19:02 <dandimitrov> Hi, Bosmon, we\'re currently working on addressing the PR comments and I\'ll be going back to that problem hopefully tomorrow.
2017-11-07T14:19:16 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - awesome, thanks!

2017-11-07T14:49:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m trying to think about the configurability of say performing a read immediately before or after a write for FLUID-6209. Do you think something like this that we have in the datasource would work https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6209/src/framework/core/js/DataSource.js#L166-L169
2017-11-07T14:49:46 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure though because the fetch and write would both have these promise chains, so it might become circular
2017-11-07T14:51:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s a reasonable idea, yes
2017-11-07T14:52:15 <Bosmon> The user may become confused because there is no "transform" element involved, but I guess that\'s not mandatory
2017-11-07T14:52:29 <Bosmon> But the idea of timing the actions using pseudoevent promise chains seems like a good fit
2017-11-07T14:52:57 <Bosmon> Let\'s again ignore that issue until we have the basic algorithmic skeleton implemented

2017-11-07T14:55:15 <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit will be starting in 5 minutes. Today we\'re talking about our personal data projects and My L3

2017-11-07T14:58:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, so you suggest i don\'t worry about the read before/after a write at this point and just get the rest of the structure in place first
2017-11-07T14:59:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2017-11-07T14:59:48 <Bosmon> And let\'s get some basic test fixtures sorted out to confirm that we haven\'t misunderstood or blundered on something basic
2017-11-07T15:00:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes a lot of sense
2017-11-07T15:00:07 <Bosmon> And after that we can start working towards configuration points like "read after write" etc.
2017-11-07T15:00:54 <Bosmon> As we discussed in our call anyway, the natural behaviour of one configuration ("write on every change") will naturally cause a write after read to be scheduled anyway
2017-11-07T15:00:57 <Bosmon> Or something like that : P
2017-11-07T15:01:18 <Justin_o> sounds like a plan...

2017-11-07T17:03:41 <colinclark> amatas, mrtyler: You\'ve seen this? https://blog.couchdb.org/2017/11/07/2-1-1-1-7-0/
2017-11-07T17:04:05 <mrtyler> no but that\'s some nice seo on the url :p
2017-11-07T17:05:14 <colinclark> ha
2017-11-07T17:05:31 <colinclark> are we having a team meeting now? I\'m confused about my calendar
2017-11-07T17:05:36 <mrtyler> we don\'t pin the couchdb image version in gpii-infra, so new cluster deployments should get the latest
2017-11-07T17:05:46 <mrtyler> i\'ll upgrade stg later
2017-11-07T17:05:56 <amatas> updating CouchDB containers....
2017-11-07T17:06:10 <mrtyler> idk if alfredo\'s new couchdb cluster work involves pinning version
2017-11-07T17:06:21 <mrtyler> colinclark: we have the ops weekly in slightly less than 2 hours
2017-11-07T17:06:29 <colinclark> ok
2017-11-07T17:06:31 <mrtyler> the previously-scheduled interview at this time was moved to friday
2017-11-07T17:06:33 <colinclark> thanks :)
2017-11-07T17:06:36 <amatas> colinclark: I have our infra meeting in two hours on my calendar
2017-11-07T17:06:43 <mrtyler> np. sandra is going HAM on the calendar right now :D
2017-11-07T17:07:00 <colinclark> it\'s wild
2017-11-07T17:07:07 <mrtyler> er sorry i guess that acronym is a little inappropriate
2017-11-07T17:07:14 <colinclark> i\'m behind on email and calendar invites because of last week\'s conference
2017-11-07T17:07:27 <amatas> mrtyler: I\'m using the lastest version of the CouchdDB for the cluster, no pinning version expected
2017-11-07T17:07:28 <colinclark> and Calendar keeps saying "YOU HAVE 4000 CALENDAR INVITES"
2017-11-07T17:07:34 <mrtyler> you mean your Grand Keynote? :p
2017-11-07T17:07:55 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-11-07T17:08:00 <colinclark> mini
2017-11-07T17:08:03 <colinclark> mini keynote

2017-11-07T17:08:11 <mrtyler> amatas: ok cool (altho in the future i expect it\'s likely we\'ll want to pin image versions to prevent weird inconsistencies amongst environments. but not today :))
2017-11-07T17:08:41 <colinclark> yeah, we always pin deps with npm
2017-11-07T17:08:45 <colinclark> after painful experience :)
2017-11-07T17:08:57 <colinclark> I think it\'s crucial to know exactly what version you\'re using
2017-11-07T17:09:01 <mrtyler> colin i\'m interested to hear about your experiences in the boulder area, but probably at a different time
2017-11-07T17:09:07 <colinclark> even at risk of having to do more manual work to update them over time
2017-11-07T17:09:15 <colinclark> amazingly, the trip was such a blur
2017-11-07T17:09:28 <colinclark> I think I was outside in the state of Colorado for a total of 15 seconds
2017-11-07T17:09:38 <mrtyler> colinclark: i agree, and one of the nice things about the version-updater situation is we can use it to pin to specific docker image versions even for components whose build process we don\'t control, like couchdb
2017-11-07T17:09:39 <colinclark> staying in the same hotel as the conference is at has its downsides
2017-11-07T17:09:49 <colinclark> that makes sense, mrtyler
2017-11-07T17:09:50 <mrtyler> heh yeah
2017-11-07T17:10:04 <colinclark> mrtyler: Here\'s the transcript of my talk in case you\'re curious: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Technology+Futurist+Talk+at+the+2017+Coleman+Institute+Conference+on+Cognitive+Disability+and+Technology
2017-11-07T17:10:10 <mrtyler> oh cool
2017-11-07T17:10:38 <mrtyler> is this doc something you created, or they made it for you after the talk?
2017-11-07T17:11:20 <amatas> well, I mean, we\'re using a fork version of the CouchDB docker repository, if a new version is released we have to trigger the update. The version is not pinned anywhere
2017-11-07T17:11:27 <amatas> so, we can control the updates
2017-11-07T17:11:54 <colinclark> mrtyler: I assembled it from my talk notes and the photos that were in my slides
2017-11-07T17:12:19 <colinclark> I have been trying more these days to document my talks so that people can see what we\'re up to even if they weren\'t at the event
2017-11-07T17:13:06 <mrtyler> as someone who can rarely be bothered to sit down and watch a video, but will frequently skim a written talk, i appreciate that :)
2017-11-07T17:13:45 <colinclark> ha :)
2017-11-07T17:14:01 <colinclark> yeah, I often use Instapaper to take written stuff and hold on to them to read on the subway
