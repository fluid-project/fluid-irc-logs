2017-11-06T21:15:09 <avtar> Bosmon, Justin_o, jhung1, simonjb: i\'ve created a https://github.com/fluid-bot account as part of FLUID-6220 the bot needs to be granted access to the infusion repo, maybe other repos as well depending on how extensively it\'s going to be used. could one of you please add it to the fluid-project gpii org?
2017-11-06T21:17:00 <Bosmon> avtar - I guess I can "invite" it.... and then I guess you can accept on its behalf ....
2017-11-06T21:17:31 <avtar> sounds good

2017-11-06T21:19:26 <avtar> thanks!
2017-11-06T21:21:43 <avtar> actually there\'s one more request
2017-11-06T21:22:15 <avtar> i\'m assuming you just got emailed regarding that

2017-11-06T12:24:30 <javjarfer> hi stegru!
2017-11-06T12:24:34 <javjarfer> Good morning
2017-11-06T12:24:39 <stegru> hello
2017-11-06T12:25:15 <javjarfer> I want to ask you about the new fluid.log
2017-11-06T12:25:20 <stegru> ok
2017-11-06T12:25:53 <javjarfer> I think that currently GPII runs in a single threaded environment because of being Node.js based, true?
2017-11-06T12:26:22 <stegru> yes
2017-11-06T12:27:16 <javjarfer> shouldn\'t we try to spawn another thread for logging purposes? taking advantage of needing to redesign fluid.log, making it live into another thread could avoid problems with making the hole system halt for whatever IO problem
2017-11-06T12:28:08 <javjarfer> like the well known issue of the default windows terminal waiting for input after a mouse event is detected
2017-11-06T12:28:35 <stegru> that\'s not something you can do in node
2017-11-06T12:29:08 <stegru> but the thread wouldn\'t halt if the log is written asynchronously
2017-11-06T12:31:22 <javjarfer> but it would halt if the log halts because the standard input is locked no?
2017-11-06T12:31:47 <stegru> is that something you\'ve noticed?
2017-11-06T12:32:29 <javjarfer> mm I think it happened to me, I can try to reproduce
2017-11-06T12:33:14 <javjarfer> yes, it halts
2017-11-06T12:35:26 <javjarfer> just execute the gpii.js and left click into the powershell window
2017-11-06T12:35:32 <javjarfer> everything halts
2017-11-06T12:35:42 <stegru> well, that\'s not something a user would do
2017-11-06T12:37:24 <javjarfer> I agree, I just wanted to know if you think that making logging more robust to IO issues would be something we should address now we are redesigning fluid.log
2017-11-06T12:38:10 <stegru> i haven\'t seen anything to doubt the robustness of it
2017-11-06T12:38:19 <stegru> apart from blocking the console
2017-11-06T12:39:40 <javjarfer> well, anything that will result into a blocking operation will result into the same behavior
2017-11-06T12:41:15 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-06T12:41:40 <stegru> not really, when gpii-app is run stdout is redirected to no where - also, the logging goes to a file

2017-11-06T13:23:05 <javjarfer> stegru, yes, that is nice, but I was thinking in which will be the behavior if I lock the file for the logs once GPII is open
2017-11-06T13:23:36 <javjarfer> it crash with a EBUSY error "Error: EBUSY: resource busy or locked, open \'C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Roaming\\gpii\\gpii-2017-11-06T125445.790Z.log\'"
2017-11-06T13:24:03 * ewbjr joined the channel
2017-11-06T13:25:32 <Justin_o> for anyone interested, I just published a new dev release of infusion to NPM ( 3.0.0-dev.20171102T191539Z.c0636b395  )

2017-11-06T15:05:24 <Justin_o> jhung: i don\'t think they have search though, but I might have missed it

2017-11-06T15:38:55 <jhung> Justin_o: Since it\'s based off Hugo we can probably use one of their existing search plugins. Also avtar menioned that Algolia grants licenses to open source projects.
2017-11-06T15:41:37 <Justin_o> jhung: i take it we could use Algolia with our current setup too
2017-11-06T15:41:57 <jhung> Justin_o: yep.
2017-11-06T15:42:01 <Justin_o> also, not sure what exactly is included in their open source pricing.. https://www.algolia.com/pricing
2017-11-06T15:42:29 <Justin_o> it says that their essential package is free for open source, but that option has a scaleable amount of records and indexing..
2017-11-06T15:43:53 <Justin_o> okay found it. https://www.algolia.com/for-open-source
2017-11-06T15:44:01 <Justin_o> it\'s 100k records and 200k operations monthly
2017-11-06T15:44:05 * alanharnum has quit
2017-11-06T15:44:10 <Justin_o> i don\'t know what that means in practical terms for us though
2017-11-06T15:44:43 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-06T15:44:45 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah I\'m not sure either since we don\'t have search functionality to analyze anyway.
2017-11-06T15:45:15 <Justin_o> i suppose we can test with their free tier to start with
2017-11-06T15:45:22 * dandimitrov has quit
2017-11-06T15:47:32 <jhung> Justin_o: I was also wondering about any privacy concerns with using a 3rd party search. I\'m reading their privacy policy now...
2017-11-06T15:47:50 <Justin_o> jhung: ah, that\'s  a good point
2017-11-06T15:48:10 <jhung> Justin_o:  https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy if you\'re curous

2017-11-06T15:50:39 <Justin_o> jhung: i skimmed over that, but it sounds more like the privacy of the subscriber as opposed to those performing searches
2017-11-06T15:51:07 <Justin_o> i didn\'t notice it saying anything about the data it may have related to queries made through their api
2017-11-06T15:51:47 <Justin_o> although i don\'t really know how their service works, perhaps they don\'t have access to that data anyways
2017-11-06T15:52:10 <jhung> Maybe "Customer Data" in the ToS is what you\'re looking for? https://www.algolia.com/policies/terms

2017-11-06T16:03:37 <Justin_o> jhung: seems we may not qualify for analytics anyways, so maybe they aren\'t tracking
2017-11-06T16:03:47 <clown> okay, grrrero, I\'ll try.  :-)
2017-11-06T16:04:55 <grrrero> Lol clown I\xe2\x80\x99ll try*
2017-11-06T16:12:47 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. So far I haven\'t found anything that raises any flags. Perhaps we should try the free tier.

2017-11-06T18:01:42 <Bosmon> Hey there javjarfer
2017-11-06T18:01:49 <Bosmon> Can you expand on this statement: " I was thinking in which will be the behavior if I lock the file for the logs once GPII is open"
2017-11-06T18:01:52 <Bosmon> Can\'t quite interpret it
2017-11-06T18:02:01 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-11-06T18:10:07 <javjarfer> hi Bosmon! Of course, when I realized that a locking operation will block the thread, I tried taking the ownership of the file, while GPII is executing. The result is that it crash with a EBUSY error
2017-11-06T18:12:11 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-06T18:12:54 <Bosmon> javjarfer - seems like quite reasonable behaviour to me
2017-11-06T18:13:05 <Bosmon> One would also expect the process to crash if it couldn\'t write its logs as a result of the disk being full
2017-11-06T18:18:05 <javjarfer> Oh, then all is OK, I was just asking if that was the kind of behavior we want from logging, just to notify that a blocking behavior would affect the whole application
2017-11-06T18:18:23 <Bosmon> Yes, this is a well-known behaviour of Windows apps ...
2017-11-06T18:20:26 <javjarfer> Bosmon, hahaha true
