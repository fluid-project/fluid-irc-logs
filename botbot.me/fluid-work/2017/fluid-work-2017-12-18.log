2017-12-18T16:07:52 <clown> Hi Bosmon, got a minute?
2017-12-18T16:08:48 <clown> I\'ve looked at your comments on GPII-1882 and the associated minutes from last week\'s Windows meeting... regarding a mock process model.
2017-12-18T16:09:10 <clown> Is anyone working on this?  I could, if that doesn\'t interfere.
2017-12-18T16:09:22 <clown> Is there a JIRA for this?

2017-12-18T17:59:15 <jhernandez> stegru: hey, still around?
2017-12-18T17:59:24 <stegru> yes, jhernandez
2017-12-18T17:59:32 <jhernandez> oh, cool
2017-12-18T17:59:39 <jhernandez> I\'m testing your in-process user listeners
2017-12-18T17:59:44 <stegru> ok
2017-12-18T17:59:55 <jhernandez> so far it works very good
2017-12-18T18:00:03 <jhernandez> ut
2017-12-18T18:00:05 <jhernandez> but
2017-12-18T18:00:33 <jhernandez> removing the usb key doesn\'t trigger the key out process
2017-12-18T18:00:46 <stegru> that\'s a shame
2017-12-18T18:01:06 <stegru> i\'ll look into it
2017-12-18T18:04:27 <jhernandez> I can see the log "USB token removed"
2017-12-18T18:04:49 <jhernandez> and that "wasActive" is true
2017-12-18T18:05:04 <stegru> that\'s good, it\'s only half broken
2017-12-18T18:05:09 <jhernandez> yeah
2017-12-18T18:05:24 <jhernandez> also,  if I re-plug the usb, it does the key-out
2017-12-18T18:05:46 <jhernandez> which is a bit weird
2017-12-18T18:06:15 <jhernandez> I haven\'t looked very deep in the code
2017-12-18T18:06:20 <stegru> ohh, it sounds like it\'s acting like a NFC card
2017-12-18T18:06:32 <jhernandez> proximity?
2017-12-18T18:06:40 <jhernandez> well, yeah
2017-12-18T18:06:42 <jhernandez> NFC
2017-12-18T18:06:44 <jhernandez> no matter
2017-12-18T18:06:52 <jhernandez> whether it\'s nfc of proximity
2017-12-18T18:07:00 <stegru> yes.. where you add it, and keys in.. then add it again, it keys out
2017-12-18T18:07:01 <jhernandez> I see what you\'re saying
2017-12-18T18:07:14 * jhernandez nods
2017-12-18T18:07:41 <stegru> i\'ll look at it later
2017-12-18T18:07:52 <jhernandez> let me know if you want me to test anything here
2017-12-18T18:08:15 <stegru> no, you\'ve done enough
2017-12-18T18:08:24 <jhernandez> I\'ve got a fresh an working Windows 10 on my VAIO, which was rotten
2017-12-18T18:09:35 <jhernandez> I haven\'t had installed windows from scratch for years
2017-12-18T18:10:03 <jhernandez> and I have to say that things are much better now
2017-12-18T18:10:06 <jhernandez> yay
2017-12-18T18:10:19 <stegru> it\'s dreadful.. cortana is so patronising
2017-12-18T18:12:42 <jhernandez> even with that
2017-12-18T18:13:55 <jhernandez> I just disabled it at the beginning
