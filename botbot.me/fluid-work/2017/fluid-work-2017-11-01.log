2017-11-01T16:20:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can we schedule some time to talk about FLUID-6209. I think i\'m pretty confused right now or am missing something. Unfortunately today I really only have between the architecture meeting and 1pm ET and 2 - 2:30pm ET. I\'ll be off for the rest of the week as well.

2017-11-01T16:21:18 <Bosmon> Ok Justin_o - sorry, my time will be a bit crammed for the rest of the day :(
2017-11-01T16:21:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem, i\'m pretty crammed too... did you have time on Monday?
2017-11-01T16:21:46 <Bosmon> Yes, Monday should be good
2017-11-01T16:22:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: my schedule is open for monday, is there a time that works good for you?
2017-11-01T16:22:51 <Bosmon> I guess 11 your time would be good?
2017-11-01T16:22:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sounds good

2017-11-01T16:25:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you need an invite, or is okay to just be in the calendar?
2017-11-01T16:25:24 <Bosmon> No, I\'ll see it there

2017-11-01T17:57:13 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m having a problem with passing a component option to be one of the component\'s own listener - https://pastebin.com/TGtxCF4F
2017-11-01T17:57:17 <cindyli> did i do something wrong?
2017-11-01T17:58:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - no, what you have done is exactly right
2017-11-01T18:00:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: hitting this error: TypeError: listener.apply is not a function
2017-11-01T18:01:58 <cindyli> if I moved the actual function into the listener, without passing it thru a component option, things would be fine
2017-11-01T18:06:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, what did you put in the options?
2017-11-01T18:07:06 <cindyli> nockSetupFunc: {
2017-11-01T18:07:06 <cindyli> listener: "gpii.tests.accessRequester.setupNock",

2017-11-01T18:07:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, you can\'t transfer entire listener definitions like that
2017-11-01T18:08:56 <cindyli> what\'s the proper way to do it if i wanna pass in the function with its arguments
2017-11-01T18:09:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - you\'ll have to refer to both properties separately
2017-11-01T18:09:46 <cindyli> ok
