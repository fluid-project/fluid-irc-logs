b'2017-11-13T00:01:14 <Bosmon> chlorophilia - here\'s the beginning of the equivalent JSON document which I stuck in a gist to show my friend Steve yesterday ....

2017-11-13T00:02:39 <chlorophilia> oh, wow, huh\xe2\x80\xa6. looks like your code is eating up all the columns
2017-11-13T00:03:33 <Bosmon> You\'ll find a structure a little like this backing the two sunburst samples
2017-11-13T00:05:14 <Bosmon> For example here is the Coffee Wheel one: https://www.jasondavies.com/coffee-wheel/wheel.json
2017-11-13T00:05:34 <Bosmon> Whereas the Bostock sample has the data listed right below the code as "flare.json"

2017-11-13T11:27:51 <javjarfer[m]> Bosmon: Hi! Good morning, I was finishing somethings about your reviewing of the Simi/Sven pull, and realized that sometimes, and extra field \'error\' is added to the promise payload when rejected, like here https://github.com/JavierJF/windows/blob/a6b4123e6da5259adc962bc7b7eea73fb8fc27e3/gpii/node_modules/processHandling/processHandling.js#L273
2017-11-13T11:28:20 <javjarfer[m]> Is that a common practice, or should be used only in \'some special cases\'?

2017-11-13T13:12:10 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: I think I wrote that.. it\'s to provide more information on the underlying error
2017-11-13T13:26:27 * jhung joined the channel
2017-11-13T13:36:16 <javjarfer[m]> stegru:  nice, then it\'s something that could exist, just in case we want to provide more info?
2017-11-13T13:36:55 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: I guess you could say it\'s like .NET\'s "InnerException" property
2017-11-13T13:37:40 <stegru> if you have the information available, then why not put it in... if you haven\'t got, then don\'t worry about it
2017-11-13T13:38:33 <stegru> I don\'t think there\'s a piece of code anywhere that checks the .error field - but it will probably be dumped into the log
2017-11-13T13:42:09 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: yes, I think it could be a good practice to keep more info in that field that we could log latter, so, we agree that message should be the \'short message\' and \'error\' should be in case of being able to provide aditional info true?
2017-11-13T13:42:27 <javjarfer[m]> should it be a \'plain string\' or any array like type?
2017-11-13T13:42:46 <stegru> I think "message" should be a string
2017-11-13T13:46:01 <javjarfer[m]> okay, and the \'error\' field? should be also a string? or other kind of type?
2017-11-13T13:47:50 <stegru> I didn\'t follow or make a rule.. i just put the rejection reason into that field
2017-11-13T13:50:21 <stegru> it\'s javascript - you can use whatever object type you like ;)
2017-11-13T13:55:11 <javjarfer[m]> haha sure, but I wanted to know if we will follow a convention
2017-11-13T13:58:04 <stegru> The only convention is "isError" and "message"

2017-11-13T16:02:30 <sepidehshahi> sure gtirloni

2017-11-13T16:18:37 <cindyli> simonjb: you mentioned one thing you\'d like to figure out before merging the pull request that secures /untrusted-settings endpoint (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/558) is what tokens should be added to the initial auth data file at https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2538/testData/security/TestOAuth2DataStore.json
2017-11-13T16:19:11 <simonjb> cindyli: yes
2017-11-13T16:19:17 <cindyli> Bosmon/Bosmon7 said his feeling is to add tokens for snapsets
2017-11-13T16:19:26 <simonjb> yes
2017-11-13T16:19:37 <cindyli> i\'m thinking we might need 2 different sets for dev and production environment
2017-11-13T16:19:54 * kavya joined the channel
2017-11-13T16:19:56 <cindyli> snapsets are more for the projection than development
2017-11-13T16:20:00 * alanharnum2 joined the channel
2017-11-13T16:20:06 <cindyli> typo, "production"
2017-11-13T16:20:51 <cindyli> for the production, it might start with an empty database then we added tokens for snapsets as production data
2017-11-13T16:21:45 <cindyli> for the dev environment, meaning the data in https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2538/testData/security/TestOAuth2DataStore.json, do you think it makes sense to add all test tokens in the testData/preferences in there
2017-11-13T16:22:15 <cindyli> so the tokens in the dev auth database match the tokens that have preferences assoicated
2017-11-13T16:22:39 <cindyli> let me know what you think, simonjb
2017-11-13T16:22:45 <cindyli> and Bosmon/Bosmon7
