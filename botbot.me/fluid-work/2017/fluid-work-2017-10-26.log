b'2017-10-26T21:15:53 <colinclark> and I believe it can be used easily with a component I made for grabbing video frames and writing them to a Canvas
2017-10-26T21:15:59 <colinclark> for taking your snapshots
2017-10-26T21:17:22 <gmoss> alanharnum: "Created Apr 16, 2016", looks like it\'s a burning issue for them
2017-10-26T21:19:17 <colinclark> can you just extract a dataURL from the canvas instead?
2017-10-26T21:19:45 <alanharnum> colinclark: yup: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL
2017-10-26T21:20:15 <colinclark> :)
2017-10-26T21:20:29 <alanharnum> the current implementation goes video -> canvas "preview" -> img "save", but it\'s more convoluted than it would probably need to be.
2017-10-26T21:21:36 <colinclark> well, it doesn\'t seem too far off
2017-10-26T21:21:51 <colinclark> you probably want to see your live video, by piping the stream to a video element
2017-10-26T21:22:00 <colinclark> and then you probably do want to see the image you\'ve captured
2017-10-26T21:22:20 <colinclark> like in an image element as you\'ve done
2017-10-26T21:23:56 <colinclark> once you\'ve got the data url, you\'re in good shape to then post it to your server, base64 decode it, and save it to the file system or whatever you\'ve got planned :)
2017-10-26T21:24:30 <colinclark> I mean, if you leave it base64 encoded, it\'s already to be stored in CouchDB :P
2017-10-26T21:24:36 <colinclark> the architecture of champions
2017-10-26T21:25:41 <alanharnum> colinclark: if I\'m reading correctly, we probably should be able to simply use kettle.dataSource.file, possibly with minor modifications - it supports based64: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/DataSources.md#configuration-options-accepted-by-kettledatasourcefile
2017-10-26T21:26:20 <colinclark> that\'s a funny typo in the Kettle docs
2017-10-26T21:27:13 <colinclark> I think the charEncoding string is probably "base64" rather than "based"
2017-10-26T21:27:31 <alanharnum> yes, that would seem logical :)
2017-10-26T21:28:28 <colinclark> anyway, that\'s very nice
2017-10-26T21:28:46 <colinclark> that will make things very simple for you

2017-10-26T19:52:03 <colinclark> alanharnum, gmoss: https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/RecordRTC/
2017-10-26T19:53:24 <alanharnum> https://github.com/webrtc/samples also has a lot of examples https://github.com/webrtc/samples
2017-10-26T19:53:46 <gmoss> colinclark: super neat
2017-10-26T19:54:05 <colinclark> In Safari, it seems limited to recording audio
2017-10-26T19:54:15 <colinclark> can you take a quick look in Edge, gmoss?
2017-10-26T19:54:23 <colinclark> it will save me having to boot up my Moonbook Pro
2017-10-26T19:55:47 <colinclark> the frame rate is bizarrely bad on my computer, though
2017-10-26T19:56:19 <colinclark> in Firefox Quantum, that is
2017-10-26T19:56:22 <gmoss> colinclark: it's a little weird in Edge. only audio is offered, and I doesn't seem to work very well
2017-10-26T19:56:27 <colinclark> ok
2017-10-26T19:56:31 <colinclark> well, that's not a bad sign
2017-10-26T19:56:37 <colinclark> two browers is good enough to start
2017-10-26T19:56:37 <gmoss> the buttons after recording don't seem to work
2017-10-26T19:56:53 <colinclark> and I genuinely think the situation on Safari will improve over time
2017-10-26T19:58:03 <gmoss> colinclark: confirmed audio recording works fine in Edge actually, I had my headphones muted :) but the interaction afterwards still doesn't work quite well. all the same this is a very cool little tool
2017-10-26T19:58:11 <colinclark> ok
2017-10-26T19:58:22 <colinclark> the samples that alanharnum posted have what look like better and simpler examples
2017-10-26T19:58:23 <gmoss> and MIT licence!
2017-10-26T19:58:33 <colinclark> this one is kind of interesting: https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC/tree/master/RecordRTC-over-Socketio
2017-10-26T19:58:53 <colinclark> in that you can see the use of the ffmpeg node.js module for conversion at the end of the process
2017-10-26T20:00:59 <colinclark> anyway, i think we can do some interesting things soon with video
2017-10-26T20:01:42 <colinclark> but let's start with audio first, which I will hack on a little more now
2017-10-26T20:02:11 * gmoss is the notes...

2017-10-26T21:04:17 <gmoss> colinclark: alanharnum is currently sitting beside me, his POC works in chrome and alllmost works fully in Edge, just having issues saving
2017-10-26T21:04:27 <colinclark> great
2017-10-26T21:06:20 <colinclark> you might find, before too long, that my sjrk.mediaDevice and sjrk.mediaStreamHolder grades might be of some help in reducing the amount of code here :)
2017-10-26T21:07:56 <colinclark> I actually probably have other components from a motion tracking project from years ago that will help with painting images to a Canvas, too
2017-10-26T21:07:59 <colinclark> but I'll have to check
2017-10-26T21:09:26 <colinclark> it is disappointing that media stream-based code that is only a couple years ago is already broken in modern browsers\xe2\x80\x94so much churn on these APIs
2017-10-26T21:10:18 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah, I'm hoping things are a bit stabilized at this point
2017-10-26T21:10:38 <alanharnum> at least in terms of the mediaDevices API
2017-10-26T21:11:43 <alanharnum> and yes, we'll want to extend your base grades for a real implementation - but at least in principle taking some snaps from the camera for upload doesn't seem too hard
2017-10-26T21:11:56 <alanharnum> Simple Matter of Programming (tm)
2017-10-26T21:12:53 <colinclark> hahah
2017-10-26T21:13:04 <colinclark> yeah, that's always the problem with software
2017-10-26T21:13:07 <colinclark> Programming
2017-10-26T21:13:38 <alanharnum> I was just telling gmoss how absolutely pig-ignorant I am of what the current practice is for uploading files to a server from a browser, but I am sure it is possible! ;)
2017-10-26T21:14:01 <colinclark> well, you know
2017-10-26T21:14:08 <colinclark> gmoss probably knows these things well
2017-10-26T21:14:30 <gmoss> colinclark: indeed, though my knowledge is entirely in the .net realm, unfortunately
2017-10-26T21:14:33 <colinclark> you just POST it :)
2017-10-26T21:14:38 <gmoss> I suppose there will be some parallels
2017-10-26T21:14:42 <gmoss> haha true
2017-10-26T21:14:45 <colinclark> it's all just the web :)
2017-10-26T21:15:30 <colinclark> It looks like I also have a component, in a motion tracking library I wrote a few years ago, that connects a media stream to a <video> element for live previewing
2017-10-26T21:15:46 <alanharnum> gmoss: looks like this is the issue in Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/7226452/
