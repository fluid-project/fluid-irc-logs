2017-11-24T13:46:58 <cindyli> Justin_o: i found i don\'t have push access to https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors when pushing ur https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/109
2017-11-24T13:47:13 <Justin_o> :( ah
2017-11-24T13:47:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have commit access to GPII generally?
2017-11-24T13:47:38 <cindyli> i do
2017-11-24T13:47:53 <cindyli> i mean to gpii/universal
2017-11-24T13:48:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, do they have different policies for each repo?
2017-11-24T13:48:09 <Justin_o> and is there a list of committers?
2017-11-24T13:49:41 <cindyli> Justin_o: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Technical_Governance#Current_Committers
2017-11-24T13:50:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: so you should have access
2017-11-24T13:50:29 <cindyli> i don\'t know if there is a different set of committers for each repo
2017-11-24T13:51:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: it lists prefsEditors repo as being governed by that document and you are mentioned as committer there
2017-11-24T13:52:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you know who\'s managing the commit access to GPII repos?
2017-11-24T13:52:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m not sure it is anyone in particular : P
2017-11-24T13:53:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cindyli doesn\'t seem to have access to push to the gpii/prefsEditors repo, and I was hoping she could merge a PR for me there
2017-11-24T13:53:29 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you help Justin_o to merge his pull request https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/109
2017-11-24T13:53:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve added the core committers team to that repo
2017-11-24T13:53:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2017-11-24T13:53:37 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure why it wasn\'t there before
2017-11-24T13:53:47 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Bosmon
2017-11-24T13:53:56 <cindyli> Justin_o: pushed
2017-11-24T13:55:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: great thanks
2017-11-24T13:55:16 <cindyli> np
2017-11-24T13:57:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what do you think of me deleting https://github.com/fluid-project/data-dashboard
2017-11-24T13:57:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the code is in https://github.com/fluid-lab/data-dashboard
2017-11-24T13:57:53 <Justin_o> the only difference is the PR that is the fluid-project version
2017-11-24T13:58:30 <Justin_o> well that\'s not the only difference, but that\'s probably the substantive difference
2017-11-24T13:58:39 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-11-24T13:59:23 <Justin_o> i guess the one in fluid-project is technically the primary repo.. i guess we could look at moving that to fluid-lab and merging in the PR.. what do you think
2017-11-24T13:59:30 <Justin_o> and then dropping the one from fluid-lab
2017-11-24T14:00:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have no idea : P
2017-11-24T14:00:23 <Bosmon> About which projects belong in fluid-lab
2017-11-24T14:01:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i started moving the GSoC projects to fluid-lab
2017-11-24T14:01:37 <Justin_o> well.. i did that for most of them a while ago.. all of our most recent ones are there
2017-11-24T14:01:48 <Justin_o> data-dashboard sort of lives in both though

2017-11-24T15:02:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I tested out your UIO+ pull and added comments on the GPII-2725 JIRA
2017-11-24T15:02:11 <Bosmon> Minor scrolling problem remains
2017-11-24T15:21:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just looking over your buffered component at https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-6209/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L954-L1071
2017-11-24T15:21:44 <Bosmon> I think it\'s looking pretty good
2017-11-24T15:21:56 <Bosmon> I think it probably belongs in its own file since DataBinding.js is already pretty crowded
2017-11-24T15:24:17 <Bosmon> Probably the extra level of model containment "buffered" is unnecessary
2017-11-24T15:24:58 <Bosmon> The "rebasing" looks pretty cool and as far as I can tell the tests actually test it : P
2017-11-24T15:25:03 <Bosmon> Although these things are always hard to follow
2017-11-24T15:25:54 <Bosmon> I guess now it\'s time to work on the overall instrumentation and splitting up of the fetch and write lifecycles so that they are more configurable and open to interception

2017-11-24T16:46:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also i put them in the buffered model containment to help prevent collisions with other model values.. but if you think it\'s safe, i\'ll move them all up
2017-11-24T16:47:02 * kasparnet_ joined the channel
2017-11-24T16:48:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: related to GPII-2725, i left a comment on the JIRA.. I had mentioned that on the PR as well.. i\'m not actually sure how to best fix that without potentially a much larger refactoring of the adjuster.. it\'s related to the fact that the radio buttons are spread across the panel, whereas the other panels all have their adjusters centred
2017-11-24T16:48:51 <Justin_o> perhaps i can see if i can stack the underlying radio buttons ontop of each other in the middle of the panel.. i\'ll do some more exploration
2017-11-24T16:48:59 <Justin_o> let me know if you have any ideas

2017-11-24T16:50:08 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - well, I don\'t think you should fiddle with the markup
2017-11-24T16:50:39 <Bosmon> I notice you already have a "rounding" calculation in the arrowScroller
2017-11-24T16:51:03 <Bosmon> So I imagine you could use that to ensure that, unless the scrolling is performed with the scrollbar, that the view remains snapped to panel units
2017-11-24T16:51:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I don\'t think you can differentiate between them, unless i listen for, say tab keystrokes
2017-11-24T16:52:50 * kasparnet_ has quit
2017-11-24T16:58:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i\'m looking through the event object and I don\'t see anything that indicates what triggered the scroll event
2017-11-24T17:00:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, how about this - if any scrolling occurs which is not part of a continuous action, to snap to the nearest panel
2017-11-24T17:01:03 <Bosmon> You could even use our by now familiar debounce code for this :)
2017-11-24T17:01:29 <Bosmon> Although I assume that scrollbars are capable of signalling when a scroll action is complete, perhaps it might be more difficult for a swipe
2017-11-24T17:11:48 * michelled joined the channel
2017-11-24T17:12:05 * stegru has quit
2017-11-24T17:20:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i actually am already using debounce code there because scroll events do not signal when they are complete
2017-11-24T17:21:06 <Justin_o> they fire continuously.. i think iOS might be an exception
2017-11-24T17:22:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  the problem with snapping back to a panel though is that when some adjustments are applied the panels don\'t all fit within the width, so the user would have to scroll around to see all of the panel
2017-11-24T17:23:50 * amatas_ joined the channel
2017-11-24T17:24:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that last part there doesn\'t really affect UIO+ because we don\'t apply adjustments to it
2017-11-24T17:24:16 <Justin_o> so we could look at overriding that just there
2017-11-24T17:24:25 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-24T17:35:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, or more generally we can override the behaviour when for whatever reason the panel\'s size doesn\'t match that of the viewport
2017-11-24T17:35:42 <Bosmon> But when we have a viewport which was sized to make exactly one panel visible, it looks very peculiar to "miss" : p
2017-11-24T17:37:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i did tested out the override and it seems to be working nicely.. it actually might work in Infusion for the case I had been concerned with.. i\'m going to test it out there as well now and make the fix in infusion if i can.
2017-11-24T17:38:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome!
