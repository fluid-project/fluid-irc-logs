2017-11-02T14:44:41 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov
2017-11-02T14:44:48 <Bosmon> Finally I have some time now :)
2017-11-02T14:44:59 <Bosmon> So you pinged me with a link to PcpSettingsPanelTests.js
2017-11-02T14:45:06 <Bosmon> Although perhaps the line numbers have changed by now
2017-11-02T14:45:14 <Bosmon> I wonder why you have introduced a separate event for each panel?
2017-11-02T14:52:49 <dandimitrov> Hi Bosmon
2017-11-02T14:53:39 <dandimitrov> No, we haven\'t made changes there (in that branch) to keep the link up-to-date :)
2017-11-02T14:54:05 <Bosmon> ok cool
2017-11-02T14:54:17 <Bosmon> Line 660 is a closing curly bracket : P
2017-11-02T14:54:18 <dandimitrov> Regarding the seperate events, I wanted to ensure that all used panels (panels with single settings) are created before the "tester" for them is initializer. This is to handle the resources featching async work
2017-11-02T14:55:04 <dandimitrov> ohh

2017-11-02T14:56:20 <dandimitrov> ^Try this one :)
2017-11-02T14:56:50 <Bosmon> Oh yes ok great
2017-11-02T14:56:52 <Bosmon> let me try this

2017-11-02T15:03:00 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: the ongoing subway interruption means I likely won\'t make it for standup, so here\'s my update. Yesterday we had Caren\'s presentation of her IEP experience, then the community meeting about inclusive design and localization. After that I wrapped up some mandatory training for HR, which took a few hours. Today I plan to continue review the Jiras for the storytelling tool, test the UI on my phone and we
2017-11-02T15:03:00 <gmoss> have the SJRK+MyL3+Nexus meeting
2017-11-02T15:03:40 <stegru> keep up the good work
2017-11-02T15:06:03 * kavya joined the channel
2017-11-02T15:09:59 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey there
2017-11-02T15:11:39 <jhernandez> the other day, during our pilots meeting, Han reported this problem that I have just described in this JIRA ticket https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2671
2017-11-02T15:11:45 <Bosmon> Hey there jhernandez
2017-11-02T15:13:39 <jhernandez> basically, he was indicating that sometimes it was a bit confusing for him when reviewing the logfiles in the pilot sites
2017-11-02T15:14:24 <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, I\'m glad at least that someone is reviewing them :)
2017-11-02T15:14:31 <jhernandez> heh
2017-11-02T15:14:34 <jhernandez> indeed
2017-11-02T15:14:39 <jhernandez> same here
2017-11-02T15:14:42 <jhernandez> :=
2017-11-02T15:14:44 <jhernandez> :)
2017-11-02T15:23:42 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov - so the expansion problem is caused by a long-standing Infusion anomaly
2017-11-02T15:23:55 <Bosmon> Just for clarity I have written it up at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6219
2017-11-02T15:24:05 <Bosmon> Basically there is only one "slot" per option in a component\'s fully merged defaults
2017-11-02T15:24:21 <Bosmon> And so using it for an expander makes it impossible to merge anything else in there
2017-11-02T15:25:29 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - rewriting your attrsExpander like this: https://gist.github.com/amb26/22391001d8cd879ee176087a57b2b581
2017-11-02T15:25:33 <Bosmon> Will allow your test to pass
2017-11-02T15:25:44 <Bosmon> Although you also need to fix your test to use jqUnit.assertDeepEq
2017-11-02T15:29:31 <dandimitrov> Hmm... this distributeOptions usage looks a bit like sorcery to me :D
2017-11-02T15:33:01 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, How do you find the the idea of putting these `attrs` in the `model` and exploit this expansion misbehaviour (to recall, proper expansion happens only for the model) even further
2017-11-02T15:33:36 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - I think that would be even worse :)
2017-11-02T15:34:00 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry for the sorcery of distributeOptions, but in the "current" framework they are the only things that behave like the "future" framework
2017-11-02T15:34:13 <Bosmon> So although it looks like sorcery currently, writing it in this way will help future users of the code
2017-11-02T15:34:34 <Bosmon> The model double expansion anomaly will also be fixed in a future revision
2017-11-02T15:34:51 <Bosmon> So right now the distributeOptions sorcery is the only scheme that i) works now, ii) is forward-compatible : P
2017-11-02T15:35:51 <Bosmon> As long as you leave the reference to FLUID-6219 in the comment there, the future reader will know when the sorcery can be removed
2017-11-02T15:38:57 <kavya> Hi Steve Githens
2017-11-02T15:39:00 <dandimitrov> Yeah, this makes sense. Thank you Bosmon. we\'ll give this approach a try :)
2017-11-02T15:39:26 <kavya> Just want to check on  https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2147
2017-11-02T15:41:07 * georgitodorov has quit
2017-11-02T15:51:36 <alanharnum> gmoss danayo simonjb michelled: I\'d be in favour of cancelling both the MyL3 meeting & the SJRK/Nexus/Myl3 one - Colin and Sepideh are both away & there\'s a lot of stuff going on already (also, selfishly, i\'ll likely be out somewhere between 1-3 to pick up cat from vet)
2017-11-02T15:51:58 <Bosmon> Nothing selfish about picking up a ... *CATE* :)
2017-11-02T15:52:00 <Bosmon> I hope he is ok
2017-11-02T15:52:34 <alanharnum> Bosmon: yes, just a minor procedure
2017-11-02T15:53:01 <danayo> alanharnum: sounds good to me
2017-11-02T15:53:16 <alanharnum> he\'s been to the vet a lot recently as we figure out the right insulin dosage for him, so he\'s now got the sound of the carrier getting taken out in his memory and knows to hide under the couch
2017-11-02T15:53:39 <Bosmon> Yes, mine can hear the carrier clanking from across the house.....
2017-11-02T15:54:38 <danayo> alanharnum: treat bribery time!
2017-11-02T15:59:44 <michelled> alanharnum: let\'s cancel the SJRK-Nexus-MyL3 meeting for the next month or more. This is something we need to pick up again, but perhaps after simonjb has got the P4A Nexus work done
2017-11-02T15:59:59 <michelled> danayo ^
2017-11-02T16:01:13 <simonjb> cancelling the SJRK-Nexus-MyL3 meetings for a while works for me
2017-11-02T16:03:25 <gmoss> alanharnum: I concur with the rest of the gang, we have other things on our plate currently, and not everyone is available today.
2017-11-02T16:04:23 <gmoss> alanharnum Bosmon danayo: my boys haven\'t been to the vet since we adopted them earlier this year, but they\'ll soon know the terror of a cat carrier
2017-11-02T16:04:38 <gmoss> *cate?
2017-11-02T16:04:56 <alanharnum> one thing to mention that happened after the multilingual meeting yesterday while I remember it, since Justin & Sepideh aren\'t here - Justin tested out how CSS letter-spacing property affects Farsi script, in terms of a theoretical adjuster for UIO that did that
2017-11-02T16:05:23 <alanharnum> it completely breaks Farsi script and presumably other calligraphic-type scripts that join letters
2017-11-02T16:06:17 <alanharnum> which raises an interesting challenge for multilingual UIO, because adjusters dealing with text may be more than inapplicable for certain language scripts, but actively detrimental
2017-11-02T16:06:42 <alanharnum> danayo gmoss grrrero in particular may find the above interesting ^
2017-11-02T16:08:02 <grrrero> That\'s a good point alanharnum... I wonder if I can whip up a version with a baybayin font
2017-11-02T16:10:20 <grrrero> For anyone interested in baybayin: https://snoworld.one/baybayin-the-forgotten-pre-hispanic-writing-of-the-filipino/
2017-11-02T16:11:56 <danayo> thanks alanharnum, I do find that interesting!
2017-11-02T16:12:19 <alanharnum> grrrero: feel free to fork from https://github.com/waharnum/uio-multilingual as a starting point - in theory it would be a matter of setting the language code and providing an appropriate message bundle, but I\'m not sure how good the Unicode support for Baybayin is in browers (it has Unicode support according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin#Unicode, but it doesn\'t display in Chrome for me)
2017-11-02T16:12:35 <grrrero> Awesome, thanks alanharnum!!!
2017-11-02T16:12:53 <gmoss> grrrero: I\'m curious to see how it goes!
2017-11-02T16:13:08 * grrrero is excited
2017-11-02T16:13:45 <alanharnum> danayo: it\'s another area that shows how Anglocentric computing is
2017-11-02T16:13:51 <danayo> totally
2017-11-02T16:17:53 * jhung has quit
2017-11-02T16:27:53 <danayo> alanharnum: I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about why CSS letter-spacing property adjustment breaks calligraphic script - in terms of how the spaces between letters are defined/constructed differently than non-calligraphic script
2017-11-02T16:28:36 <alanharnum> danayo: I\'m not clear on it myself either, but I\'d guess it\'s something about how different elements are composed by the rendering engine into a complete word
2017-11-02T16:29:28 <danayo> I wonder - is there a way to \xe2\x80\x9cunrender\xe2\x80\x9d the words first? if that makes any sense at all
2017-11-02T16:30:45 <alanharnum> danayo: this is interesting in that light - it\'s not about Farsi, but Arabic, which has (I understand from Sepideh & others) similar written characteristics: https://w3c.github.io/alreq/
2017-11-02T16:31:06 <alanharnum> includes discussion of "does letter-spacing have any meaning for Arabic? how should it be treated"?
2017-11-02T16:31:50 <danayo> cool thanks alanharnum
2017-11-02T16:32:10 <alanharnum> danayo: part of a letter W3C initiative on I18N: https://www.w3.org/International/ig/Overview
2017-11-02T16:33:02 <alanharnum> danayo: ah, and here\'s an "International text layout and typography index": http://w3c.github.io/typography/
2017-11-02T16:42:14 <danayo> alanharnum: The only spaces inside Arabic words are created near characters that are not dual-joining. When adjusing intra-word spaces (i.e. the space inside the words) only these spaces can be adjusted. Moving two joined characters closer to or further from each other creates undesirable results.
2017-11-02T16:42:45 <danayo> alanharnum: it seems to me if the calligraphic font is rendered correctly, letter spacing should work ok? such that the joined characters would stay joined?
2017-11-02T16:43:21 <alanharnum> danayo: yeah, I think the issue is that browser behaviour is not correct - the joined characters do not stay joined
2017-11-02T16:43:28 <danayo> right
2017-11-02T16:44:20 <alanharnum> danayo: here\'s a specific issue on Arabic joining breaking improperly: https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues/246
2017-11-02T16:58:28 <gmoss> alanharnum: I plan on closing SJRK-6, is that okay with you?
2017-11-02T17:02:08 <simonjb> alanharnum: regarding displaying Baybayin in Chrome, it\'s likely that you don\'t have a font on your system with the glyphs
2017-11-02T17:02:40 <simonjb> I found this web page that includes a list of Tagalog fonts: http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts-philippine.html
2017-11-02T17:16:06 <simonjb> the fonts links on that page are out of date
2017-11-02T17:16:15 <simonjb> this page has the fonts http://paulmorrow.ca/fonts.htm
2017-11-02T17:16:58 <alanharnum> gmoss: good w/me
2017-11-02T17:24:16 <gmoss> alanharnum: okay, all done! thanks for merging yesterday
