2017-05-24T13:39:56 <stegru> javjarfer: got a spare moment? could you run "net user your-username" in a command prompt and let me know if it\'s in spanish or not?
2017-05-24T13:40:40 <javjarfer> stegru, of course, just a second
2017-05-24T13:41:08 <javjarfer> stegru, spanish
2017-05-24T13:41:09 <stegru> on "real windows", not our vagrant box ;)
2017-05-24T13:41:12 <stegru> ah ok thanks
2017-05-24T13:41:21 <javjarfer> yes, on real windows
2017-05-24T13:41:49 <stegru> espanol gamberro!
2017-05-24T13:42:00 <javjarfer> xDDDD
2017-05-24T13:42:53 <javjarfer> totally, also, right now my system is also in Spanish (I have both) Spanish and English, some programs show localization issues... when load things in Spanish if the whole system is not
2017-05-24T13:43:11 <javjarfer> consistency! xD
2017-05-24T13:43:28 <stegru> what about "shutdown /t 0", is that in spanish? ;)
2017-05-24T13:43:42 <javjarfer> hahaha nice try
2017-05-24T13:44:39 <stegru> localisation makes it difficult to parse the output of commands
2017-05-24T13:45:49 <javjarfer> stegru, yes... isn\'t anything in the internals for changing the output of commands inside a environment? Like setting a ENV variable temporally?
2017-05-24T13:46:01 <stegru> ohh..
2017-05-24T13:46:03 <javjarfer> I don\'t know how (badly) is that handle in Windows
2017-05-24T13:46:11 <amatas> in a Linux env you can use the env variable "LANG" to use the localization that you want
2017-05-24T13:46:36 <stegru> only if the language is installed in windows, i bet
2017-05-24T13:47:13 <javjarfer> stegru, mmm well then... We will need to install English by default xD

2017-05-24T13:47:55 * kavya joined the channel
2017-05-24T13:48:19 <stegru> i can change the language of a thread, but I guess the language must be installed
2017-05-24T13:49:07 <stegru> it\'s easier just to get the value I want myself, rather than change the language and parse the output of a tool
2017-05-24T13:49:53 * sirdancealot joined the channel
2017-05-24T13:50:21 <stegru> amatas: I did that a while ago to test something on firefox, but now it\'s always in french!
2017-05-24T13:50:55 <javjarfer> 30 years making a development environment so you cannot easily use the default tools for getting a value, great success
2017-05-24T13:53:52 <jhernandez> monsieur stegru. je ne savais pas que tu parles fran\xc3\xa7ais :P
2017-05-24T13:54:32 <stegru> haha
2017-05-24T13:55:04 <amatas> D\'abord c\'\xc3\xa9tait Firefox, c\'est maintenant le client IRC
