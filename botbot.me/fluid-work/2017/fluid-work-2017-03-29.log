2017-03-29T13:51:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I can't assign it or cc people, IMO it'd be good to invite Simon or Cindy in as well.

2017-03-29T15:10:43 <cindyli> colinclark: the video for the chrome extension with uio enactors is ready. is it ok i place it in my dropbox and send you a link to download?
2017-03-29T15:10:56 <colinclark> sure!
2017-03-29T15:11:03 <colinclark> I was thinking that we could get away with a non-public youtube video
2017-03-29T15:11:23 <colinclark> i think the default when you upload to youtube is that a video can be accessed by a link but doesn't show up in search results
2017-03-29T15:11:27 <colinclark> and that should be fine, i think
2017-03-29T15:11:40 <cindyli> that sounds good. let me try
2017-03-29T15:11:43 <colinclark> eventually it should even be fine to make it fully public, but you just never know with this project sometimes ;)
2017-03-29T15:13:00 <cindyli> michelled: do you know the idrc youtube account?
2017-03-29T15:20:56 <cindyli> nvm, using my own account
2017-03-29T15:25:13 <michelled> cindyli: I don't - you'll have to ask alan tomorrow
2017-03-29T15:25:29 <cindyli> ok. thanks, michelled
2017-03-29T15:36:29 <colinclark> cindyli: This video is AWESOME!
