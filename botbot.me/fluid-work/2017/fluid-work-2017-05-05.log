2017-05-05T17:48:18 <colinclark> alanharnum: what was the fancy terminal you use on the Mac?
2017-05-05T17:48:34 <colinclark> for those of us who sadly are not t-muxly inclined
2017-05-05T17:48:53 <alanharnum> colinclark: https://www.iterm2.com/
2017-05-05T17:50:03 <alanharnum> using https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized as the theme
2017-05-05T17:51:13 <colinclark> it has a Toolbelt!
2017-05-05T17:52:53 <colinclark> I\'m into it already, alanharnum
2017-05-05T17:53:10 <colinclark> it lost a small number of points for defaulting to Monaco
2017-05-05T17:53:16 <colinclark> but that was easily fixed
2017-05-05T17:54:22 <colinclark> so stoked i won\'t have to deal with Terminal\'s bad window tiling whenever I change display resolutions/sizes

2017-05-05T20:49:32 <Bosmon7> Hi there michelled - yes, it is a funny issue
2017-05-05T20:50:02 <Bosmon7> In general we do use limited es6 features, at least at the API level, but so far none that would break our existing linting
2017-05-05T20:50:32 <Bosmon7> In theory we might be ok with es6 language features, especially if they are supported in IE11, but so many of the language-level features are somewhat useless and in many cases actively confusing
2017-05-05T20:50:48 <Bosmon7> So for example here, I don\'t see any useful purpose that making this definition "const" serves
2017-05-05T20:51:08 <Bosmon7> In general this is part of this "pointless access-barring" mentality that traditional developers have, that we don\'t generally agree with
2017-05-05T20:51:22 <Bosmon7> So my opinion here would be to simply remove the const definition rather than changing our linting rules
2017-05-05T20:51:56 <michelled> gloob, do you remember why you chose to use \'const\' here? Are you good with me removing it so we pass linting with the current rules? https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/hst-2017/main.js#L21

2017-05-05T21:49:07 <gloob> michelled: probably because the immutability nature of that assignation, traditional developers glitches :D for me is ok to remove that. It was long time ago.
2017-05-05T21:49:32 <michelled> yep :) thanks
