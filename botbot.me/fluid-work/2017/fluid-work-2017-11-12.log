2017-11-12T23:14:26 <chlorophilia> hey bosmon and company. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen lots of folks come and go the google doc. curious how things are coming along and whether you\xe2\x80\x99d like any feedback
2017-11-12T23:35:35 <Bosmon> Oh hey there chlorophilia - yes it\'s going ok, hopefully I\'ll have something to show you tomorrow or so
2017-11-12T23:36:05 <chlorophilia> haha, you\xe2\x80\x99ve left me in suspense. Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94my gosh! I am excited.
2017-11-12T23:36:56 <Bosmon> It\'s been interesting disassembling the various samples and apprehending their various forms of sleaze : P
2017-11-12T23:40:43 <Bosmon> Like for example in the Bostock sample.... once you zoom in, where do the out of range wedges ACTUALLY GO ...
2017-11-12T23:41:21 <Bosmon> Which is clearly an issue that the coffee sample struggled with manfully when they had to figure out how to attach labels to them
2017-11-12T23:45:08 <chlorophilia> huh...
2017-11-12T23:45:17 <chlorophilia> I see, struggling with limitations of the template
2017-11-12T23:45:56 <Bosmon> Well, more the whole development idiom where it\'s enough for stuff to just "look right" ....
2017-11-12T23:46:16 <chlorophilia> haha, ah I see, the sleaze
2017-11-12T23:46:25 <Bosmon> And also the fear that if your code uses one keystroke more than is strictly necessary, that someone is going to laugh at you
2017-11-12T23:46:36 <Bosmon> Which, sadly in our industry, is a very legitimate fear
2017-11-12T23:47:14 <chlorophilia> which columns are relevant in your design so far?
2017-11-12T23:51:28 <chlorophilia> so curious about how the google document maps. I have played with some js but no so far as to query a csv or spreadsheet
