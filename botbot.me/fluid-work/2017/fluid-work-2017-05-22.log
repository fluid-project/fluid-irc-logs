2017-05-22T15:34:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, here is the intro to the rough notes I have been preparing for Wednesday\'s meeting: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/drafts/infusion-and-json-schema.html
2017-05-22T15:34:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I have done the most work on the topic of "reuse":  http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/drafts/infusion-and-json-schema-reuse.htmlThere is a stub for an article on UI issues that I will flesh out tomorrow.
