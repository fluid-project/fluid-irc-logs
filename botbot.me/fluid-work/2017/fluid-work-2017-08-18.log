2017-08-18T18:03:06 <stegru> so you sent a "Request", getAccessToken...
2017-08-18T18:03:36 <cindyli> very nice
2017-08-18T18:03:37 <stegru> it returns with a getAccessToken response (rather than just waiting for it)
2017-08-18T18:04:23 <cindyli> are these http requests and responses?
2017-08-18T18:04:40 <stegru> no.. just blobs of json
2017-08-18T18:05:05 <stegru> because i was thinking either side could send a message
2017-08-18T18:06:20 <stegru> i think i had (or was thinking of) some cool code that wraps this kind of thing in a promise
2017-08-18T18:07:30 <cindyli> this is super in time
2017-08-18T18:07:31 <stegru> you could do: (on LFM) accessRequester.send("getAccessToken request").then(...)
2017-08-18T18:08:28 <stegru> the "send" sends this thing, and there\'s something that reads the return data waiting for the response to the request, and resolves the promise when it\'s received

2017-08-18T18:10:32 <cindyli> stegru: do you have a test that shows 2 ends talk to each other using messaging?
2017-08-18T18:10:55 <stegru> i\'m about to write that test
2017-08-18T18:13:27 <cindyli> cool. i will check this repo when I\'m back on writing the access requester. thanks, stegru
2017-08-18T18:13:42 <stegru> ok cindyli
2017-08-18T18:14:44 <stegru> oh that repo isn\'t the final destination.. it will be in gpii/node_modules
2017-08-18T18:15:12 <stegru> i just wanted to develop outside, in case it got infected by infusion
2017-08-18T18:15:49 <mrtyler> /quit
2017-08-18T18:17:48 <cindyli> stegru: so, that repo will land in the GPII universal repo?
2017-08-18T18:18:04 <stegru> windows
2017-08-18T18:18:16 <cindyli> ok

2017-08-18T13:37:43 <jhung> gtirloni: so I did some testing of gitium last night. I ended up using PressLabs\' gitium-base VM as I couldn\'t figure out how to get it working on our CentOS VM.
2017-08-18T13:38:45 <jhung> gtirloni: unfortunately gitium needs to be manually triggered. It does the job at tracking changes, but it only creates a commit and push when triggered from the admin menu. So it\'s not the automated solution we\'re looking for.
2017-08-18T13:39:38 <jhung> gtirloni: so what I\'m looking into now is using incron to monitor changes to the theme and plugin directories, and create commits on changes.

2017-08-18T13:48:34 <jhung> gtirloni: I\'ll check revisr out as well. It\'ll be good to try both approaches and see what is more appropriate. I\'m wary of being dependent upon a plugin, but still worth trying.
2017-08-18T13:49:11 <gtirloni> jhung: agreed. maybe gitium requiring an active stance from the user in committing the changes isn\'t so bad, but it requires some training I guess
2017-08-18T13:50:25 <jhung> gtirloni: true. Also gitium is still rather new, so perhaps an automated feature is planned later. I\'ll keep you posted in what I find.

2017-08-18T17:17:48 <cindyli> Bosmon, stegru, i\'m thinking how the access requester module should be written so that it can be started as a separate process using a gpii specific account on windows. to remind you what the access requester is - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Designs_of_Using_a_Dedicated_Process_to_Protect_the_Client_Secret_Assigned_to_GPII_Local_Installation#Workflow
2017-08-18T17:18:06 <stegru> oh not this again ;)
2017-08-18T17:18:17 <cindyli> i know. but \xe2\x80\xa6
2017-08-18T17:18:54 <cindyli> shall the access requester eventually be another electron wrapped exe?
2017-08-18T17:19:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - I don\'t think that was simonjb\'s original conception
2017-08-18T17:20:31 <stegru> if it\'s running as another user, i think having a UI might be problematic (I have nothing to back this up, either way)
2017-08-18T17:21:46 <cindyli> stegru: does it need to have an UI? if you meant "GPII manager", according to our meeting with UX team, likely "GPII manager" is not needed
2017-08-18T17:22:12 <cindyli> simon is not around. Bosmon: what\'s your understanding of simonjb\'s original conception?
2017-08-18T17:23:10 <stegru> i\'m not saying it does or not, but "electron wrapped exe" tells me it would have a UI
2017-08-18T17:23:22 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that the access requester is a low privilege minimal executable with no UI
2017-08-18T17:24:21 <cindyli> right. no UI. ok, so my understanding of using electron might be wrong. i was thinking to use it to create an exe that can be started as a separate process
2017-08-18T17:25:40 <stegru> yes it would have to be another process in order for it to run as another user
2017-08-18T17:26:03 <stegru> (or another thread, to be precise)
2017-08-18T17:26:41 <cindyli> do we have an example in GPII that a GPII owned node module is started as a separate thread?
2017-08-18T17:27:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - stegru did it once
2017-08-18T17:27:04 <Bosmon> And then he stopped : P
2017-08-18T17:27:08 <Bosmon> It was to get round an SPI problem
2017-08-18T17:27:19 <stegru> no, I started again
2017-08-18T17:27:26 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2017-08-18T17:27:28 <cindyli> haha, cool!!
2017-08-18T17:27:34 <Bosmon> I always forget whether we actually have that or not :)
2017-08-18T17:28:13 <stegru> yes, my "do every SPI in another process" idea wasn\'t good
2017-08-18T17:28:38 <stegru> then another problem with SPI came along, so it was "do SOME SPI in another process"
2017-08-18T17:29:15 <cindyli> stegru: if the access requester is written as a infusion component, would it be a problem to start it as a separate windows process?
2017-08-18T17:30:04 <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/windows/commit/262f3cdab799dada84f001d6207ace386667fc24#diff-e388fb861fe79246f42dc8de824ec1b0R155
2017-08-18T17:31:14 <stegru> on my original attempt i tried to include WindowsUtilities.js, the start-up time was too long due to loading the framework
2017-08-18T17:32:53 <stegru> i don\'t think fluid has a "run this compentent in a different process" feature
2017-08-18T17:33:23 <stegru> component, i meant
2017-08-18T17:34:09 <cindyli> stegru, Bosmon, if so, how should the access requester be written?
2017-08-18T17:35:12 <cindyli> if i understood correctly, our listeners like rfc listener can be started as a separate process, but they were written in C?
2017-08-18T17:35:53 <Bosmon> I imagine the startup time issue won\'t be so serious here since we will be starting this process just once
2017-08-18T17:36:15 <stegru> for starting as another user, it just needs to be invoked like "node /where/ever/accessRequester.js"
2017-08-18T17:36:50 <cindyli> Bosmon: this process will be started whenever GPII app starts
2017-08-18T17:36:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - right, which is just once
2017-08-18T17:37:05 <cindyli> right
2017-08-18T17:37:10 * colinclark has quit
2017-08-18T17:37:36 <Bosmon> stegru had some tougher requirements in his case since he needed to start a process whenever we made an SPI call
2017-08-18T17:38:57 <stegru> oh cindyli, the gpii-app can\'t start this process
2017-08-18T17:39:30 <stegru> hold on, need to order tea
2017-08-18T17:39:42 <cindyli> lol
2017-08-18T17:40:59 <cindyli> i think the access requester would be a part of gpii-app
2017-08-18T17:42:30 <cindyli> well it depends on how we call those 2 processes
2017-08-18T17:43:39 <cindyli> in the workflow chart, gpii-app consists of 2 processes, one is the local flow manager, the other is the access requester
2017-08-18T17:43:46 <stegru> yes
2017-08-18T17:43:56 <cindyli> apparently, the first one is more than just the local flow manager
2017-08-18T17:44:45 <cindyli> it should have all other gpii modules except the access requester
2017-08-18T17:44:50 <stegru> but in order for it to be started as the "gpii-user", it has to be already running as a higher privilege
2017-08-18T17:46:14 <stegru> which is what i\'m woroking on at the moment.. they wanted a service to keep GPII running (GPII-2338), so i can also make it do what you want too
2017-08-18T17:46:18 <cindyli> stegru: u mean if the first process is started by the login user, and the access reqeuster should be started by "gpii-user". in the case that the login user and gpii-user are the same privileged users, the first process won\'t be able to start the access requester as a child?
2017-08-18T17:46:51 <stegru> that\'s right
2017-08-18T17:47:13 <cindyli> that\'s cool, stegru, does it mean when GPII-2338 is ready, starting the access requester as a separate process would not be a problem?
2017-08-18T17:47:30 <stegru> because you need a password to run as another user.. but where will this password be stored so the gpii-app can access it
2017-08-18T17:47:41 <stegru> that\'s right
2017-08-18T17:52:56 <stegru> it will have to have it\'s own "windows/gpii.js" like file, for the entry point.. but it could still access other parts of GPII like a normal module, although the state would be entirely different
2017-08-18T17:53:51 <cindyli> i can write "gpii/node_modules/accessRequester/index.js" as the entry point
2017-08-18T17:55:54 <stegru> yeh, i was thinking that too
2017-08-18T17:56:00 <cindyli> stegru: once the access requester is started, every time when the local flow manager needs to talk to the cloud, LFM needs to pass the gpii token to the access requester and receives an access token. how does this be achieved?
2017-08-18T17:57:03 <stegru> so you want the access requester to be able to talk to the gpii-app?
2017-08-18T17:57:42 <cindyli> yes
2017-08-18T17:58:26 <stegru> through a pipe
2017-08-18T17:58:34 <cindyli> i was thinking to provide an infusion invoker that returns a promise object whose resolved value is the access token - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2436/gpii/node_modules/accessRequester/src/accessRequester.js#L42
2017-08-18T17:59:50 <cindyli> but with the access requester being a windows process, this API might be problematic
2017-08-18T18:00:00 <stegru> well, i don\'t think returning a promise will work
