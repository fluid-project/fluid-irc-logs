2017-05-04T15:53:46 <danayo> glad you think so colinclark :)
2017-05-04T15:53:57 <danayo> there are so many cool digital storytelling projects out there!

2017-05-04T16:24:38 <clown> cindyli, michelled:  clue why "const" is rejected by eslint:  http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-environments
2017-05-04T16:25:06 <clown> the .eslintrc might need to specify the "es6" environment.
2017-05-04T16:25:38 <cindyli> ah. good finding

2017-05-04T16:27:09 <cindyli> clown, michelled, i pushed my changes to https://github.com/cindyli/gpii-app/tree/GPII-2092. so you can see DevelopmentTests passing but the process that runs the test hangs
2017-05-04T16:27:26 <michelled> thx cindyli
2017-05-04T16:27:29 <cindyli> for you to reproduce the problem to fix ;)
2017-05-04T16:28:06 <michelled> yep, on it :)

2017-05-04T17:43:59 <cindyli> clown, michelled, forgot to mention, in my branch, i\'ve modified Vagrantfile to use a newer windows vm. according to avtar, the old vm has the license expired and we are encouraged to use this newer vm box: https://github.com/cindyli/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2092/Vagrantfile#L13. this means if you run "vagrant destroy; vagrant up", it will trigger the download of a 8.1G windows vm

2017-05-04T18:13:45 <clown> cindyli:  thanks for the heads-up.  Yes, in my windows setting handler work today, I\'m finding that my windows vm is automatically shutting itself down after a while.  Probably because of the licence.
2017-05-04T18:14:21 <cindyli> ya, possible
2017-05-04T18:19:30 <michelled> btw cindyli, clown: the testing framework automatically accumulates all the tests that are run and delivers the final number

2017-05-04T18:57:35 <michelled> hey Bosmon, Bosmon8: question for you about the version of ecmascript that we should be linting against. when the check to ensure the GPII isn\'t already running was added, we used \'const\'. this will only pass linting if we added the \'es6\' flag to our eslint directives
2017-05-04T18:57:45 <michelled> do you have an opinion on this?
