2017-03-08T16:40:13 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, no worries, upgrading to the version you mentioned in this thread fixed the provisioning problems: http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2017-January/004489.html
2017-03-08T16:45:19 <javjarfer> kasparnet, I will try something I will update you when I have something (after the end of the meeting)

2017-03-08T17:35:34 <kasparne_> javjarfer: I wont have time right after this meeting, but perhaps at 20:00 (not sure) - alternatively tomorrow
2017-03-08T17:36:22 <javjarfer> kasparne_, ok, no problem, then It will be better tomorrow maybe
2017-03-08T17:36:28 <javjarfer> I will ping you!

2017-03-08T18:57:25 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I haven't - Bosmon, are you there? What are we doing this afternoon? :)
2017-03-08T19:03:55 <Bosmon> alanharnum - well, I dunno : P
2017-03-08T19:04:03 <Bosmon> I guess we are going to work through your tutorial?
2017-03-08T19:04:09 <Bosmon> And then we will wind and gas on randomly?
2017-03-08T19:04:33 <alanharnum> Bosmon: that was pretty much what I was thinking we'd do unless you had a different plan

2017-03-08T19:14:52 <Justin_o> for example for people who have basic / moderate levels of experience with programming
2017-03-08T19:15:49 <alanharnum> Justin_o: at least in terms of my tutorial, I would say if someone has Javascript familiarity, they'd probably get something out of it
2017-03-08T19:17:05 <alanharnum> some of what I'm hoping to talk about with Bosmon is the philosophy as well as the mechanics of the core concepts identified in the tutorial (event-driven and model-driven programming, among other things)
2017-03-08T19:18:12 <alanharnum> in a way that's beginner-friendly
2017-03-08T19:19:38 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks

2017-03-08T20:58:49 <javjarfer> and I forgot this was today
2017-03-08T20:59:17 <javjarfer> I don't know why it didn't showed up in my calendar...
2017-03-08T21:00:43 <gtirloni> no worries! maybe you need to add fluid's calendar to your google calendar (just shared it with you through the calendar UI)
2017-03-08T21:02:29 <javjarfer> gtirloni, thanks you! I didn't have that calendar, I really think that I had put this one manually... But it looks like I didn't
2017-03-08T21:03:01 <javjarfer> pfff what a fail, hope I could assist to next one

2017-03-08T15:01:31 <stegru> so do i
2017-03-08T15:01:38 <colinclark> SO DOES stegru!
2017-03-08T15:01:50 <stegru> javjarfer: it\'s literally gpii.launce.exec = child_process.exec
2017-03-08T15:01:52 <kasparnet> stegru knows everything
2017-03-08T15:02:03 <stegru> no, i\'m just a know-it-all

2017-03-08T15:06:51 <javjarfer> thanks all, yes stegru , I had looked at the code, that is the reason why I didn\'t understand what was happening, problem is that doesn\'t behave like that, I mean, if you execute a command using "child_process.exec" the same command doesn\'t behave the same when executing it using "gpii.launch.exec"
2017-03-08T15:07:24 <stegru> oh right, well, you\'ve reached the bound of my knowledge on it
2017-03-08T15:08:27 * michelled joined the channel
2017-03-08T15:08:47 <stegru> what does it do differently, javjarfer ?
2017-03-08T15:08:53 <javjarfer> ish... thanks you. I would like to open a discussion on how to proceed with several things I need right now, because of this and other similar ones
2017-03-08T15:09:07 <javjarfer> stegru, I\'m going to give you the complete example
2017-03-08T15:09:11 * clown joined the channel
2017-03-08T15:09:21 <javjarfer> also I\'m going to make a push so you can see it in my repository
2017-03-08T15:11:09 <javjarfer> This command, "START \\"\\" \\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Classic Shell\\\\ClassicStartMenu.exe\\" \\"-exit\\"" behaves perfectly using "child_process.exec" it\'s thought to do all the scape, in a way that should be identical, to the one for processing "gpii.launch.exe"
2017-03-08T15:12:00 <stegru> what\'s the purpose of using "start"?
2017-03-08T15:12:11 <javjarfer> but, in gpii.launch.exe, doesn\'t work, also, gpii.launch.exe doesn\'t output to the log, gpii.launch.spawn does, but I can\'t see any output from "exec"
2017-03-08T15:12:17 <stegru> i know what it is, but why se it?
2017-03-08T15:12:36 <javjarfer> simply to avoid this start "\\"\\"
2017-03-08T15:12:50 <stegru> by the way, you mentioned "gpii.launch.exe".. are you not using "exec"?
2017-03-08T15:12:51 <kasparnet> \\me is just catching up
2017-03-08T15:13:19 <javjarfer> because if you start like that, at the second time you pass the string, you will have -""- which will be resolved to -Nothing-
2017-03-08T15:14:00 <javjarfer> stegru, yes, it was a typo I meant "exec"
2017-03-08T15:14:24 <stegru> ok just checking
2017-03-08T15:14:54 * danayo joined the channel
2017-03-08T15:14:56 <stegru> what i mean is, why are you invoking ClassicStartMenu.exe via the start command?
2017-03-08T15:15:31 <stegru> what\'s wrong with just: "command": "c:\\\\\\progra...\\\\ClassicStartMenu.exe -exit"
2017-03-08T15:15:44 <javjarfer> stegru, that was the reason, simply to not start like this: "command": "\\"\\"C:\\\\Program..."
2017-03-08T15:15:45 <stegru> i\'m not challenging you, i\'m just curious
2017-03-08T15:15:55 <javjarfer> haha of course! No problem!
2017-03-08T15:16:21 <javjarfer> because the path has spaces, and you need to quote it
2017-03-08T15:16:23 <stegru> oh! I get it.. it\'s to make "c:\\program files\\\\" one word?
2017-03-08T15:16:25 <stegru> yes ok
2017-03-08T15:16:33 <javjarfer> yes... that is
2017-03-08T15:18:09 * kavya joined the channel
2017-03-08T15:19:03 <stegru> well, I don\'t know why it works differently
2017-03-08T15:19:55 <kasparnet> hmmm... no, that seems pretty weird to me as well
2017-03-08T15:19:55 <stegru> does the same thing happen if you replace it with "c:\\windows\
otepad.exe"?
2017-03-08T15:20:19 <kasparnet> also - perhaps to debug, if you change gpii.launch.exec to a function - like:
2017-03-08T15:21:00 <kasparnet> gpii.launch.exec(command, options): { console.log(command, options); child_process.exec(command, options); }
2017-03-08T15:21:28 <kasparnet> oops - should have been a = in there instead of the ":"... but you know what i mean
2017-03-08T15:21:42 <kasparnet> it might give you a better chance to debug
2017-03-08T15:22:03 <stegru> yeh, I had to do that once
2017-03-08T15:22:22 <javjarfer> stegru, I don\'t know, but I can say that this works "Powershell.exe -executionpolicy remotesigned -File \\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Classic Shell\\\\ClassicShellStop.ps1\\""
2017-03-08T15:23:27 <javjarfer> because it\'s the approach I\'m right now taking, but I will try to change the command
2017-03-08T15:23:52 <javjarfer> kasparnet, yes... that will be really good for debugging, I will try it and say what I can see
2017-03-08T15:23:59 <javjarfer> wait a second!
2017-03-08T15:24:27 <stegru> ...?
2017-03-08T15:24:46 <kasparnet> oh the suspense
2017-03-08T15:25:02 <kasparnet> ... it\'s either a brilliant insight, or a "doh!" moment
2017-03-08T15:25:10 <stegru> i hope the second
2017-03-08T15:25:15 <kasparnet> haha
2017-03-08T15:25:27 <stegru> he\'s now working out how to remove this from the irc logs
2017-03-08T15:25:34 <kasparnet> hahaha
2017-03-08T15:26:38 <kasparnet> gotta go afk for 15 mins
2017-03-08T15:26:39 <kasparnet> brb
2017-03-08T15:28:02 <javjarfer> (hahaha I was actually going to try the kasparnet idea and report what I see)
2017-03-08T15:28:22 <stegru> ahh!
2017-03-08T15:30:49 * kasparnet has quit
2017-03-08T15:31:03 <stegru> oh by the way, i\'m not sure if this fixes the problem, but have a look at how other applications are launched, like firefox and jaws.. they\'re use a location in the registry to specify where the .exe is found
2017-03-08T15:32:05 <stegru> for example, someone may have it stored in "C:\\Archivos de programa"

2017-03-08T16:01:47 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, upgrading vagrant and virtualbox seems to get me much further.
2017-03-08T16:01:47 <javjarfer> this is what the "gpii.launch.exec" see when it receives the command "START "" "C:\\Program Files\\Classic Shell\\ClassicStartMenu.exe" "-exit" undefined"
2017-03-08T16:01:54 <stegru> that\'s ok, I lost interest
2017-03-08T16:02:08 <kasparnet> javjarfer: nope, proabably not
2017-03-08T16:02:26 <kasparnet> it\'s mostly for stability and compatibility purposes
2017-03-08T16:02:29 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: I\'ve had problems like this.. the only way I "fixed" it was by re-trying
2017-03-08T16:03:12 <javjarfer> the key is the final "undefined", I don\'t know where it comes from
2017-03-08T16:04:58 <javjarfer> haha np stegru, thanks for the help
2017-03-08T16:04:59 <kasparnet> javjarfer: ... hmm... that\'s weird
2017-03-08T16:04:59 <kasparnet> how are you getting the output?
2017-03-08T16:05:27 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, sorry I\'m full of meetings today. But yes, in some cases the upgrading of Vagrant can fix that issue
2017-03-08T16:05:56 <javjarfer> kasparnet, using the approach you said before, I changed the gpii.launch.exec
2017-03-08T16:06:18 <javjarfer> and I\'m console "logging" the command it receives
2017-03-08T16:07:28 <javjarfer> kasparnet, yes... looks really weird
2017-03-08T16:07:44 <javjarfer> I don\'t know if has nothing to be with the JSON parsing
2017-03-08T16:08:32 <kasparnet> hmmm
2017-03-08T16:09:00 <kasparnet> what if you change the log to: console.log("COMMAND: ", command, "\
OPTIONS: ", options);
2017-03-08T16:09:18 <kasparnet> that should make it clearer where the undefined comes from
2017-03-08T16:10:08 <stegru> or set a breakpoint
2017-03-08T16:11:08 <kasparnet> yeah
2017-03-08T16:11:53 <javjarfer> yes, my bad, I\'m testing, but really looks like it will be the "options"
2017-03-08T16:11:56 <kasparnet> child_process.exec(command, options).stdout.on(\'data\', function(data) {     console.log(data);  });
2017-03-08T16:12:21 <kasparnet> should give you the output from the process
2017-03-08T16:14:16 <javjarfer> confirmed, the options were the "undefined"
2017-03-08T16:14:36 <javjarfer> I\'m going with that now
2017-03-08T16:14:45 <javjarfer> Just a second!
2017-03-08T16:19:20 <javjarfer> okay, kasparnet I haven\'t see any differences in the output with that last one
2017-03-08T16:19:41 <javjarfer> this is the command it\'s seeing - START "" "C:\\Program Files\\Classic Shell\\ClassicStartMenu.exe" "-exit" -
2017-03-08T16:21:17 <javjarfer> So I think that now the question is, why when that exact command is passed to "process_child.exec" works, and why when passed to "gpii.launch.exec" not
2017-03-08T16:31:01 <amatas> avtar, https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci/commit/8759018bdb52c21ddf86129540a7d9e6f4b16048 , and the 0.0.6 version is released with the above changes.
2017-03-08T16:32:11 <kasparnet> is the last dash a typo or something that is actually sent to it?
2017-03-08T16:34:11 <javjarfer> kasparnet, sorry last and first dash are just marking the actual command, I didn\'t want to use quotes because I thought they could lead to confusion xD
