2017-07-14T07:48:12 <the-t-in-rtf> ?
2017-07-14T07:48:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to run that import today, that\'s all I\'m waiting on.
2017-07-14T07:48:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I can make one manually if needed.

2017-07-14T10:16:13 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: I\'ve done the backup, and also I can confirm that the files are saved in the backup server
2017-07-14T10:16:33 <amatas> all files that are in /var/lib/couchdb I mean
2017-07-14T10:16:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Awesome, great timing.
2017-07-14T10:16:50 <amatas> ;)
2017-07-14T10:16:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I will run the imports in a few minutes.
2017-07-14T10:17:33 <the-t-in-rtf> They have a barber who comes to the collocation space, I\'ll do it once he finishes.
2017-07-14T10:17:48 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s awesome, he\'s within sight of my desk, I can keep working until the second it\'s time to get my hair cut.\\
2017-07-14T10:17:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Try that with a normal barber.
2017-07-14T10:19:26 <amatas> hehe it\'s the first time I hear something like that
2017-07-14T10:19:42 <amatas> don\'t waste your time on a hair cut
2017-07-14T10:20:56 <amatas> I guess that you\'ll need something like this http://www.norcostco.com/ProductImages/display/5900.jpg
2017-07-14T10:24:20 <amatas> oh wait I\'ve missunderstood, I thought that the barber cuts your hair while you\'re working :D

2017-07-14T10:42:21 <jhernandez> Bosmon: morning
2017-07-14T10:43:32 <jhernandez> I saw that yesterday you made a new kettle with fluid-resolve, but looks like you forgot to actually replace the dependency
2017-07-14T10:43:40 <jhernandez> ?
2017-07-14T10:50:10 <Bosmon> jhernandez - urgh.... I did a bad merge trying to recover the 1.6.0 release
2017-07-14T10:50:12 <Bosmon> What a blunder
2017-07-14T10:53:39 <Bosmon> Fascinating
2017-07-14T10:53:41 <jhernandez> hehe
2017-07-14T10:53:45 <Bosmon> I had even merged your PR into my branch
2017-07-14T10:53:51 <jhernandez> don\'t worry
2017-07-14T10:53:54 <Bosmon> But I should have noticed that merging it didn\'t close it
2017-07-14T10:53:57 <Bosmon> Ok, let me do it again
2017-07-14T10:54:06 <jhernandez> okay, thanks
2017-07-14T10:54:15 <jhernandez> these things sometimes happens
2017-07-14T10:54:19 <Bosmon> wow
2017-07-14T10:54:22 <Bosmon> Now I can\'t merge it
2017-07-14T10:54:27 <Bosmon> I get an incomprehensible git failure

2017-07-14T10:54:39 <Bosmon> fatal: git write-tree failed to write a tree
2017-07-14T10:54:50 <jhernandez> mmmm
2017-07-14T10:55:33 <jhernandez> it\'s the very first time I see this kind of failure
2017-07-14T10:56:45 <jhernandez> there must be something in your local copy
2017-07-14T10:57:22 <jhernandez> I\'ve just tried to merge it locally and it worked
2017-07-14T11:03:15 <Bosmon> jhernandez - ok, it should be updated now
2017-07-14T11:03:45 <Bosmon> Although sadly it still doesn\'t think the branch is merged
2017-07-14T11:05:32 <jhernandez> wow, that fast? I thought that publishing in npm would take some more time
2017-07-14T11:08:16 <Bosmon> Publishing is almost instant
2017-07-14T11:08:24 <Bosmon> Somehow setting a "dist tag" is much slower, for some reason
2017-07-14T11:08:29 <Bosmon> But we only need to do that for dev releases
2017-07-14T11:08:35 <jhernandez> I see
2017-07-14T11:09:58 <jhernandez> I\'ll re-open the pr for the update in universal and update the corresponding one for windows
2017-07-14T11:10:41 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-07-14T11:10:47 <Bosmon> I just updated universal so it should be ok
2017-07-14T11:13:19 <jhernandez> okay

2017-07-14T12:10:16 <jhernandez> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: just got this failure https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/158/console
2017-07-14T12:10:42 <jhernandez> duped infusion :/
2017-07-14T12:11:08 <the-t-in-rtf> very familiar, I got that all the time before the fix that 1.6.0 included.
2017-07-14T12:18:07 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - awkward.... clearly some unpleasant regression
2017-07-14T12:18:26 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - but which fix do you mean by 1.6.0?
2017-07-14T12:18:46 <Bosmon> Since this will be a problem with the infusion algorithm ...
2017-07-14T12:20:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I will have to dig it out, I may be confusing it with the "root of the drive" fix.
2017-07-14T12:22:15 <Bosmon> It\'s funny we haven\'t seen this before
2017-07-14T12:22:25 <Bosmon> Since I assume that windows has been using UNC paths since the beginning of time
2017-07-14T12:23:18 <Bosmon> Perhaps it is some special relationship between gpii-pouchdb\'s path for infusion and the root one, which have always been in step before
2017-07-14T12:23:41 <Bosmon> But given we are updating gpii-pouchdb anyway, this is an opportune time to look at it again ....
2017-07-14T12:44:19 <stegru> is this kind of thing caused by npm installing another version of infusion, instead of using whatever is in a node_modules further up the tree?

2017-07-14T13:18:08 <jhernandez> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: so ... is this something that can be solved/workarounded easily?
2017-07-14T13:27:15 <jhernandez> I mean, just wondering, I do know that the problem is that infusion isn\'t handling that situation very well but, can we just update the infusion ref in gpii-pouchdb and get the tests passing again?
2017-07-14T13:27:40 * javjarfer has quit
2017-07-14T13:28:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez - maybe
2017-07-14T13:28:30 <Bosmon> I wonder how I can test this, since the windows command prompt doesn\'t support UNC paths either
2017-07-14T13:28:54 <jhernandez> I can reproduce it in my vagrant box
2017-07-14T13:28:55 <Bosmon> looks like powershell does ...
2017-07-14T13:29:01 <jhernandez> oh

2017-07-14T13:32:30 <Bosmon> Using \\\\vboxsrv\\vagrant as the current directory
2017-07-14T13:32:33 <Bosmon> Can you?
2017-07-14T13:32:52 <Bosmon> Thanks, simonjb, I\'ll take a look!
2017-07-14T13:34:51 <jhernandez> Bosmon: nope
2017-07-14T13:36:51 <jhernandez> I did a cd \\\\vboxsrv\\vagrant
2017-07-14T13:37:00 <jhernandez> then a node tests\\AcceptanceTests.js builtIn
2017-07-14T13:37:05 <jhernandez> same problem
