2017-12-12T15:37:00 <stegru> amatas: about the duplicate logging, do you agree with adding a deep freeze exclusion to the registry file directory (c:\\ProgramData\\filebeat)?
2017-12-12T15:45:40 <amatas_> stegru: sounds good
2017-12-12T15:47:18 <amatas_> stegru: it would be fine if we could access to a computer and search the "registry" file that is deleted every time the computer restarts
2017-12-12T15:48:39 <stegru> amatas_: I\'m not sure what you mean
2017-12-12T15:49:03 <stegru> check if the file is really there?
2017-12-12T15:58:12 * Bosmon9 joined the channel
2017-12-12T15:58:55 <amatas_> right
2017-12-12T15:59:02 <amatas_> be sure that the file is in that directory

2017-12-12T19:51:11 <colinclark> hey Justin_o, I just had a very interesting call with danayo and a group called Values into Action, which I\'ve mentioned at standup in the past, who do work with people with intellectual disabilities, co-designing their care plans
2017-12-12T19:51:25 * michelled has quit
2017-12-12T19:51:42 <colinclark> it was incredibly inspiring, and there were so many connections with our goals doing co-design
2017-12-12T19:55:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: sounds great.. i\'m looking up their website.
2017-12-12T19:55:07 <colinclark> Justin_o: I\'d like to invite them to do a community meeting in January if possible
2017-12-12T19:55:12 <colinclark> any chance we can squeeze them in?
2017-12-12T19:55:20 * jhung has quit
2017-12-12T19:55:21 <danayo> colinclark: looks like January is booked for community meetings but Feb is open
2017-12-12T19:55:31 <danayo> unless we can move something
2017-12-12T19:55:37 <colinclark> could we move the GSoC session?
2017-12-12T19:56:28 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s probably the only one we could switch, if they could make it that day.
2017-12-12T19:56:39 <colinclark> i can send them a note and ask
2017-12-12T19:57:30 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks.. if not February is wide open at the moment

2017-12-12T20:03:03 <colinclark> ok cool
2017-12-12T20:03:09 <colinclark> I think it will be a really good session
2017-12-12T20:04:14 <colinclark> and it\'s one that maybe we could think through some collaborative activities to do with them
