2017-02-25T08:12:59 <aashay> I am trying to understand the code for chartAuthoring, i tried running the index.html in demos folder but it shows only one box in the browser and nothing else. Can anyone tell me why is this happening?

2017-02-25T08:13:16 <aashay> I suspect this to be an error while building.
2017-02-25T08:13:49 <aashay> I ran npm install successfully. Is there anything else to be done to build chartAuthoring?
