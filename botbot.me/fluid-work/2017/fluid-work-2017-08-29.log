2017-08-29T10:03:31 <javjarfer> Hi everyone! Anyone knows if it\'s intended behavior that gpii-app ignores the "installedSolutions.json" from universal?
2017-08-29T10:05:23 <stegru> do you know what it reads instead, javjarfer?
2017-08-29T10:05:51 <javjarfer> stegru, no idea
2017-08-29T10:06:34 <javjarfer> do you mean, like, which installedSolutions is actually reading?
2017-08-29T10:06:38 <stegru> gpii-app somehow works, so it must be getting the information from somewhere
2017-08-29T10:09:00 <stegru> see if breaking the file does anything - add a random \'}\'
2017-08-29T10:11:26 <javjarfer> stegru, okay! great, I\'m going to debug that after I finish with somethings

2017-08-29T13:48:58 <jhung> fluid-everyone: there isn\'t anything scheduled for today\'s design crit. Does anyone have anything they\'d like to discuss?
2017-08-29T13:49:25 * clown joined the channel
2017-08-29T13:49:52 <grrrero> jhung: gmoss was saying he\'d like to show updated demo of SJRK?
2017-08-29T13:51:41 <jhung> ok. gmoss would you be ready to talk about that? Otherwise we can schedule a different design crit.
2017-08-29T13:54:11 <gmoss> jhung grrrero: I think the talk of demoing the site was actually intended for the weekly SJRK partners meeting later today, but then at the same moment I suggested we could pick up where we left off with the same project last week, reviewing the questions I\'d written down on the wiki
2017-08-29T13:54:26 <grrrero> gmoss: Oh! Ok! Sorry I misunderstood
2017-08-29T13:55:03 <gmoss> not to worry! It\'s possible I have also ;)
2017-08-29T13:55:25 <jhung> What do you prefer gmoss? We can meet.
2017-08-29T13:55:48 <gmoss> just finding those questions to see if there\'s enough "meat" to meet :)
2017-08-29T13:55:49 <jhung> I would have to notify the channels / lists.
2017-08-29T13:55:59 <jhung> lol ok
2017-08-29T13:59:36 <gmoss> Yeah I\'m not sure that the questions we have outstanding would warrant a proper design crit, but I\'m glad to go through them!
2017-08-29T14:01:33 * danayo joined the channel
2017-08-29T14:01:49 <jhung> gmoss: since this is rather last minute, perhaps we should save it for another time when we can have a more proper discussion? I don\'t want to rush a last minute crit and not get the feedback you need.
2017-08-29T14:02:07 <gmoss> jhung that sounds very reasonable, I agree
2017-08-29T14:02:41 <jhung> (btw totally my fault, I should have sent out a sched for the design crit last Friday before I took vacation yesterday)
2017-08-29T14:02:47 <clown> what, not meaty meeting?
2017-08-29T14:03:22 <jhung> ok gmoss. let me know if you want to talk about the crit next week. I\'d have to send the email out Friday as Monday is a holiday.
2017-08-29T14:04:11 <gmoss> jhung: okay sure. I\'ll discuss it with alanharnum and danayo later today to see how they feel as well, since they\'re involved in the project as well :)
2017-08-29T14:05:13 <danayo> jhung, gmoss: thanks and sorry I think I missed the ping yesterday about this. I think it\'s best to wait on that crit discussion as well because it would allow us to give the SJRK folks more warning to join if they want to
2017-08-29T14:06:05 <danayo> and gmoss alanharnum I think showing the latest demo at today\'s SJRK meeting is a good idea too
