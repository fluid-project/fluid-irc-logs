2017-04-21T17:34:52 <cindyli> alanharnum, michelled: can one of you review my pull request that integrates the responsive UIO into floeproject.org - https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/53

2017-04-21T17:36:25 <cindyli> alanharnum: in case you missed my one-minute-ago message

2017-04-21T17:43:25 <alanharnum> having a look, cindyli
2017-04-21T17:43:42 <cindyli> thanks, alanharnum
2017-04-21T17:47:21 <alanharnum> the mobile UIO looks great on my phone
2017-04-21T17:53:49 <alanharnum> cindyli: done
2017-04-21T17:54:14 <cindyli> yay! thanks for testing, alanharnum
2017-04-21T17:58:07 <alanharnum> cindyli: I am seeing one issue on mobile at increased text sizes
2017-04-21T17:58:44 <alanharnum> which is the Hewlett logo area getting the text cut off
2017-04-21T17:58:54 <alanharnum> i think that\'s probably related to yesterday\'s work on the responsive layout
2017-04-21T17:59:09 <alanharnum> & it\'s present in the current site too
2017-04-21T17:59:46 <cindyli> trying..
2017-04-21T18:00:40 <michelled> it looks so great on mobile!
2017-04-21T18:00:45 <alanharnum> attached a screenshot to the PR
2017-04-21T18:00:45 <michelled> very exciting!

2017-04-21T19:51:59 <michelled> cindyli, alanharnum: are you seeing a scroll bar in the colour and contrast panel on the floe project site?
2017-04-21T19:52:37 <cindyli> michelled: mobile or destop version?
2017-04-21T19:52:51 <michelled> desktop
2017-04-21T19:53:33 <cindyli> no, michelled
2017-04-21T19:54:07 <cindyli> there\'s a scroll bar for the whole UIO panel
2017-04-21T19:54:14 <cindyli> horizontal scrolling
2017-04-21T19:56:40 <michelled> cindyli: I attached a pic https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-502

2017-04-21T20:00:00 <cindyli> michelled: which browser did you use. i\'ve tried firefox, chrome, safari, don\'t see it. i guess you mean the live floeproject.org site
2017-04-21T20:00:40 <cindyli> michelled: try clear browser cache before loading
2017-04-21T20:00:56 <michelled> cindyli: I cleared the cache before loading
2017-04-21T20:00:57 <michelled> FF
2017-04-21T20:01:02 <michelled> yes, the live site
2017-04-21T20:02:14 <cindyli> alanharnum: do you see it?
2017-04-21T20:03:16 <danayo> cindyli: I don\'t see it but I do see that that first default contrast button is getting cut off at the bottom slightly
2017-04-21T20:03:16 <alanharnum> michelled cindyli: no, I don\'t - looked in Chrome and FF
2017-04-21T20:03:25 <michelled> cindyli: I see it in chrome too - but not as obviously
2017-04-21T20:06:02 <cindyli> michelled: thinking if this is related to specific settings, such as, when browsers are set to use a bigger font size or so. do you have some non-default browser or computer settings?
2017-04-21T20:07:15 <michelled> I don\'t think I have a non-default setting and it isn\'t using a larger font. alanharnum thinks there might be something still cached despite having cleared the cache
2017-04-21T20:07:32 <michelled> I just tried it in my windows VM and I don\'t see the scroll bar there
2017-04-21T20:09:40 * Jess_ has quit
2017-04-21T20:10:29 <cindyli> phew\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2017-04-21T20:17:23 <michelled> cindyli: well, I don\'t know, I don\'t see it on the contrast panel, but I am seeing it on the enhance inputs panel
2017-04-21T20:17:31 <michelled> and I\'ve never loaded it before in this browser
2017-04-21T20:17:41 <michelled> rebuilt the VM fairly recently
2017-04-21T20:17:41 <cindyli> :(
2017-04-21T20:23:59 <cindyli> michelled: the enhance inputs panel does show a scrolling bar if I hover over that 2-line description and scroll
2017-04-21T20:24:07 <cindyli> the scroll bar does not show up by default
2017-04-21T20:26:04 <cindyli> does it show up on you by default, michelled
2017-04-21T20:27:25 <michelled> yes
2017-04-21T20:27:59 <cindyli> michelled: do you think it makes sense to create a separate jira for this issue?
2017-04-21T20:28:20 <michelled> yes, that makes sense
2017-04-21T20:30:11 * alanharnum has quit
2017-04-21T20:30:56 <cindyli> michelled: can you do it with a screenshot?
2017-04-21T20:33:33 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-04-21T20:38:39 <michelled> cindyli: we figured it out - I had a setting on my Mac to always show scroll bars
2017-04-21T20:38:53 <michelled> but it is certainly odd that there is a scroll bar there
2017-04-21T20:41:10 <cindyli> michelled: i think it\'s cuz that description area uses "overflow: auto" to fit any length of text
2017-04-21T20:45:44 <alanharnum> cindyli: the combination of height: auto + overflow: auto may be doing this
2017-04-21T20:45:57 <alanharnum> height: auto clearly isn\'t setting the height at quite enough to actually contain all the content
2017-04-21T20:46:44 <cindyli> good finding, alanharnum
2017-04-21T20:47:13 <cindyli> i personally think this is ok. but let\'s see what designers think
2017-04-21T20:47:27 <alanharnum> in theory you should be able to use height: auto + overflow: hidden safely together
2017-04-21T20:47:36 <alanharnum> since it should set a container height sufficient to contain the content
2017-04-21T20:47:50 <alanharnum> thus negating any need for overflow handling
2017-04-21T20:49:07 <cindyli> we should try that
