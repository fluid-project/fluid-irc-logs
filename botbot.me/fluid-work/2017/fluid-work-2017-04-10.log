2017-04-10T13:39:16 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli - welcome back :)
2017-04-10T13:39:37 <cindyli> hi, thanks, Bosmon7
2017-04-10T13:39:44 <Bosmon7> I wonder if I could get you to look at a small pull some time, it\'s not too pressing
2017-04-10T13:39:45 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/820
2017-04-10T13:39:49 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf has already verified it
2017-04-10T13:40:09 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon7
2017-04-10T13:40:18 <Bosmon7> cheers!
2017-04-10T13:41:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: after you\'re done with Bosmon7\'s PR, i have assigned you to about for Infusion and Infusion-docs for the responsive UIO related work
2017-04-10T13:42:18 <cindyli> will look at those too, Justin_o
2017-04-10T13:42:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks :)
2017-04-10T13:42:30 <cindyli> no problem

2017-04-10T15:50:25 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Justin_o
2017-04-10T16:00:44 <cindyli> Justin_o: did you forget to push up the commits for the pull 119?
2017-04-10T16:07:32 <Bosmon7> Hey cindyli - thanks so much for the merge!
2017-04-10T16:07:36 <Bosmon7> Thanks from the-t-in-rtf too :)
2017-04-10T16:07:43 <cindyli> anytime :0
2017-04-10T16:07:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, i forgot to push.. thanks for the reminder. It should be up there now
2017-04-10T16:08:01 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2017-04-10T16:08:33 <simonjb> hey Bosmon Bosmon7, quick question (in follow up to our discussion on Friday): is it the case that modelListeners on a component will have completed at onDestroy of that component (even if they are listening the model on a component other than themselves)
2017-04-10T16:09:08 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes, it should be the case
2017-04-10T16:09:21 <Bosmon7> Let me just double-check
2017-04-10T16:09:55 <simonjb> and the component whose model they are listening to isn\'t owned by the component being destroyed
2017-04-10T16:10:05 <simonjb> Bosmon7: thanks!
2017-04-10T16:12:25 <simonjb> Bosmon7: this is what my current rough implementation (user code) looks like https://gist.github.com/simonbates/701fcd52c04430cd2022d3795f86a566
2017-04-10T16:12:43 <simonjb> this component wires fakeSensor to collector
2017-04-10T16:12:57 <simonjb> sends the sensor data via model relay
2017-04-10T16:13:09 <simonjb> and records the history using a modelListener
2017-04-10T16:14:04 <simonjb> the gpii.nexus.recordValueHistory function appends the value given onto a history array at the specified model path using the target component\'s applier
2017-04-10T16:20:09 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I added the server function implementation to the gist

2017-04-10T17:00:35 <cindyli> Bosmon7: can you review this pull request when you have some time - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-architecture-docs/pull/1
2017-04-10T17:07:35 <cindyli> stegru: anonymous pipes are dead for the onboarding use case because "Unable to use anonymous pipes, because the handles can\'t be shared over different sessions.". can i assume due to the same reason, anonymous pipes are also dead for the use case of using dedicated windows service to store/retrieve gpii client secret?
2017-04-10T17:08:01 <stegru> yes, cindyli
2017-04-10T17:08:15 <cindyli> :\'(
2017-04-10T17:08:52 <stegru> it\'s ok, the work-around i\'ve done works reasonably well
2017-04-10T17:09:06 <stegru> it just doesn\'t "feel right", that\'s all.
2017-04-10T17:10:22 <cindyli> you mean the work-around to create the service with os-service npm module, stegru?
2017-04-10T17:11:07 <stegru> no, that\'s not a work-around.. os-service is what\'s needed to make a node application a windows service
2017-04-10T17:11:57 <cindyli> ok, so what\'s the work around for communication?
2017-04-10T17:12:12 <stegru> the work around is use tcp sockets, listen only on 127.0.0.1, and check process that owns the connection at the other end is the process that the server started
2017-04-10T17:13:03 <cindyli> ok, that\'s what it means, seems i didn\'t understand it in the meeting
2017-04-10T17:13:20 <stegru> ok
2017-04-10T17:14:17 * avtar joined the channel
2017-04-10T17:15:02 <cindyli> stegru: how does the server knows the process at the other end is created by the server itself?
2017-04-10T17:15:18 <cindyli> it sounds like the same security issue
2017-04-10T17:16:10 <cindyli> as the communication btw gpii local flow manager and cloud
2017-04-10T17:16:19 <stegru> the service picks a random port that it\'s listening on, and passes it to the client process when it starts it
2017-04-10T17:17:18 <cindyli> stegru: ok, so the client uses this port to communicate with the server. and once this port is occupied, no other process can use it
2017-04-10T17:17:31 <stegru> sorry, my tea is getting cold and my wife is getting angry
2017-04-10T17:17:38 <stegru> yes, that\'s right
2017-04-10T17:17:44 <cindyli> sorry. let\'s talk later
2017-04-10T17:18:42 <stegru> i\'ll push some code later to show it working
2017-04-10T17:19:04 <cindyli> that would be super. thanks, stegru.
2017-04-10T17:21:26 <cindyli> so when the communication is over, the client needs to notify the server to close that port so it won\'t be picked up by a hacker process

2017-04-10T20:20:25 <avtar> how\'s it going?
2017-04-10T20:20:46 <jhung> it\'s going.
2017-04-10T20:22:02 <avtar> is there going to be a crit tomorrow?
2017-04-10T20:23:17 <jhung> avtar I asked the design channel earlier and there weren\'t any topics. I was going to send out an email to cancel.
2017-04-10T20:23:31 <avtar> ah ok
2017-04-10T20:24:09 <avtar> are you free tomorrow morning to chat with cindyli and me about some design issues related to the ci dashboard panel?
2017-04-10T20:25:10 <jhung> avtar: not in the morning, but I will have time in the afternoon between 12p and 2p.
2017-04-10T20:25:32 <avtar> that works for me
2017-04-10T20:25:57 <avtar> i\'ll check with cindy to confirm
2017-04-10T20:26:00 <avtar> thanks
2017-04-10T20:26:33 <jhung> avtar: ok. I\'ll be in the office by lunch time.
