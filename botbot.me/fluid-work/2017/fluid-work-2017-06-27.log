2017-06-27T14:59:03 <cindyli> gtirloni: in order to answer ur email about restoring auth states for pilot 2, would you have some time today to chat with simonjb and I to give us a walkthrough of what\'s planned for the pilot 2 especially the planned workflow between user machines and the cloud?
2017-06-27T15:00:06 <gtirloni> i don\'t have that information (or it\'s not clear to me)
2017-06-27T15:00:41 <cindyli> colinclark: are you clear about that?
2017-06-27T15:01:11 <cindyli> how users and their machines will interact with GPII cloud at pilot 2?
2017-06-27T15:01:12 <gtirloni> maybe oauth 2.0 is not planned for pilot 2? we\'d like to understand what kind of state is kept, even if this is the final functionality for later pilots
2017-06-27T15:01:40 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-06-27T15:02:04 <cindyli> from my understanding so far, at least the use of client credentials to identify local flow managers is planned
2017-06-27T15:02:22 <colinclark> yes, it absolutely is
2017-06-27T15:02:43 <colinclark> Sometime potentially between pilot 1 and 2, we\'re going to have to enable users to "adopt" a snapset and make it their own
2017-06-27T15:02:47 <cindyli> but i never knew the pilot 2 will be working with pre-canned preferences sets too, so i think i may miss something
2017-06-27T15:03:02 <colinclark> this means using a simple PCP-style interface to take a snapset and be able to tweak it, and have those changes saved into the preferences server for them
2017-06-27T15:03:13 <colinclark> pilots 2 will not likely be using canned preference sets
2017-06-27T15:04:13 <cindyli> that means if our cloud deployment is planned to restore the prefs server to a initial state, users\' changes will be lost
2017-06-27T15:04:28 * Jess_ has quit
2017-06-27T15:05:42 <cindyli> gtirloni: am i mistaken when you say "If things fail, we just recover from a known state.", "a known state" doesn\'t mean the initial state?
2017-06-27T15:06:05 * alanharnum has quit
2017-06-27T15:06:11 <gtirloni> in the case of the preferences set, yes.. like reloading all the test data
2017-06-27T15:06:12 * jhung has quit
2017-06-27T15:06:20 <gtirloni> but in the case of oauth2 i don\'t know what that state is, where it\'s kept, etc
