b'2017-02-13T17:58:06 <colinclark> that makes sense
2017-02-13T17:59:52 <colinclark> So is it right to imagine, cindyli, that the app itself should be "mode" aware? i.e. this is a configuration issue for the app itself, so in its production mode it should not render the menu?
2017-02-13T18:02:23 <cindyli> having a look on michelled\'s branch to make sure what i suggest would work...
2017-02-13T18:02:57 <cindyli> michelled: is this the one - https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/tree/GPII-2092
2017-02-13T18:03:58 <cindyli> colinclark, michelled, we can create 2 versions of gpii.app: one has the menu subcomponent, the other doesn\'t have
2017-02-13T18:04:17 <michelled> cindyli, use this branch: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/tree/GPII-1596
2017-02-13T18:04:24 <michelled> it\'s the one I\'ve made the pull request with
2017-02-13T18:04:33 <michelled> I\'ll merge my other branches into it when they are ready
2017-02-13T18:04:34 <colinclark> two different grades, cindyli? one which represents production and the other, development?
2017-02-13T18:04:37 <cindyli> when you distribute gpii.app as a subcomponent of flow manager here https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-1596/configs/app.json#L6
2017-02-13T18:04:40 <cindyli> yes, colinclark
2017-02-13T18:04:48 <colinclark> sweet, i am following :)
2017-02-13T18:05:07 <cindyli> in the production, distribute the one that doesn\'t have the menu subcomponent
2017-02-13T18:05:14 <cindyli> in the dev, distribute the other one
2017-02-13T18:05:23 <colinclark> sounds sensible
2017-02-13T18:05:58 <cindyli> so, you will have 2 config files in "configs" dir for these different configs
2017-02-13T18:07:57 <michelled> cindyli: we want the \'menu\' subcomponent regardless - it\'s the values in the actual menu that we want to change
2017-02-13T18:08:12 <michelled> is this still best done with distribute options?
2017-02-13T18:09:07 <cindyli> ok, michelled, my first thought is, make whatever part you\'d like to be flexible a component and making gpii.app versions with/without it
2017-02-13T18:09:37 <cindyli> let me know if it\'s hard to do.
2017-02-13T18:10:03 <michelled> ok cindyli thx
2017-02-13T18:11:33 <jhernandez> stegru: FYI, just added a comment into https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2200
2017-02-13T18:12:16 <jhernandez> I don\'t see any other way to fix that problem
2017-02-13T18:12:29 * kasparnet has quit
2017-02-13T18:14:30 <jhernandez> Bosmon: in fact, I\'d still say that this is problem in the gpii-app itself, since we\'re also missing the log from the initialization stage of universal
2017-02-13T18:14:59 <jhernandez> which I think it\'s important to have recorder into our logfiles
2017-02-13T18:15:07 <jhernandez> *recorded

2017-02-13T18:33:28 <michelled> cindyli: I now have two versions \'menuInApp\' and \'menuInAppDev\' https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-1596-config/src/app.js#L205
2017-02-13T18:34:55 <michelled> so now I need to change they type of the \'menu\' subcomponent based on whether we are in development or production mode https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-1596-config/src/app.js#L41
2017-02-13T18:37:38 <cindyli> michelled: i think the easier way is to add the grade you created for the flexible part as a grade of this menu component. so it would always be the same "menu" type with/without an addon grade
2017-02-13T18:40:21 <michelled> cindyli: do you have an example? I don\'t understand what you are suggesting
2017-02-13T18:41:04 <cindyli> drafting an example. one sec...
2017-02-13T18:43:58 <cindyli> michelled: assume you\'ve created a grade component named "gpii.app.menuAddon" for the flexible part of the menu
2017-02-13T18:44:37 <cindyli> this menuAddon by default is not part of "gpii.app.menuInApp"
2017-02-13T18:44:55 <cindyli> you will then have 2 config files in the "configs" dir
2017-02-13T18:45:37 <cindyli> the one for not having the menuAddon is what you have now
2017-02-13T18:45:48 <cindyli> the new one will look like this: http://pastebin.com/qCjfGhqQ
2017-02-13T18:46:07 <cindyli> see line 10-13
2017-02-13T18:47:06 <michelled> interesting
2017-02-13T18:47:10 <michelled> thx cindyli
2017-02-13T18:48:20 <cindyli> anytime. let me know if it doesn\'t make sense to your use case

2017-02-13T19:36:36 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I imagine we can solve the headline issue pretty easily
2017-02-13T19:36:42 <Bosmon> By just moving the location of the logging statement
2017-02-13T19:36:50 <Bosmon> Dealing with logging the startup of universal is more problematic
2017-02-13T19:39:22 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yeah, this is what I\'ve done - moving the location fixes the issue to get the os information into the log file
2017-02-13T19:39:55 * kavya has quit
2017-02-13T19:42:14 <jhernandez> and yes, in relation to the startup of universal, a quick fix can be to make the gpii-app\'s logging module not depending on universal to determine the directory where the logs are being stored
2017-02-13T19:42:41 <michelled> cindyli1: I\'ve implemented your suggestion. It means that if people want to run the app in dev mode, they need to change the config file here: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-1596-config/main.js#L28
2017-02-13T19:42:59 <michelled> I think that is what you expected, correct?
2017-02-13T19:45:47 <cindyli1> michelled: it would be nice if main.js can be refactored to be like https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/index.js#L78-L86
2017-02-13T19:46:14 <cindyli1> so users can config which config file to be used using NODE_ENV
2017-02-13T19:47:35 <michelled> sounds good cindyli1
2017-02-13T19:47:48 <cindyli1> thank YOU, michelled

2017-02-13T15:49:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m looking some more at the tests for FLUID-6125
2017-02-13T15:49:09 <Justin_o> i\'m finding that there are edge cases
2017-02-13T15:49:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - quite so :)
2017-02-13T15:49:51 <Justin_o> there are issues where it\'s rounding up, but should be rounding down. I managed to make a modification that addresses those that I have tests for, but now one of the other tests is failing
2017-02-13T15:50:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2017-02-13T15:50:27 <Bosmon> Did you try out the snippet you found in that npm module, in comparison?
2017-02-13T15:50:28 <Justin_o> because 1.005 - 1 produces 0.004999999999999893 instead of 0.005
2017-02-13T15:50:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not yet, but was thinking of doing that too
2017-02-13T15:50:46 <Justin_o> maybe i should just do that now
2017-02-13T15:51:24 <Bosmon> It\'s great that you are accumulating all these important test cases
2017-02-13T15:52:33 <Justin_o> thanks... :)  though I wish things would just work
2017-02-13T15:52:42 <Bosmon> ha
2017-02-13T15:56:44 * kavya joined the channel
2017-02-13T15:58:33 <kavya> Hi,Can someone let me know..
2017-02-13T15:59:19 <kavya> What should be the behavior of GPII when user y tries to key in when user x is already keyed in
2017-02-13T16:00:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it doesn\'t work either, but i think it\'s because it\'s significant digits instead number of decimal places.. so there is some differences with the logic in general
2017-02-13T16:00:44 <Justin_o> hard to compare exactly but it also seems to be having some trouble with negative numbers
2017-02-13T16:01:12 <stegru> kavya: the current behaviour is nothing
2017-02-13T16:03:07 <kavya> stegru: Yes, the current behaviour when logging in with USB or NFC is nothing when user is already signed in
2017-02-13T16:03:43 <kavya> When logging in using URL the browser displays message saying user x is already logged in
2017-02-13T16:04:21 <kavya> the installer version which we have now with GPII-app has list of users in contextual menu
2017-02-13T16:05:12 <kavya> when using these users, the application signs out user x and then logins with user y
2017-02-13T16:07:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this one might work https://www.npmjs.com/package/round-to
2017-02-13T16:08:25 <kavya> for example,when user elod is keyed in. If we try to login with elmer from this menu, gpii signs out elod first and then signs in with elmer and applies high contast settings
2017-02-13T16:08:57 <kavya> Which behavior should we go ahead with?
2017-02-13T16:09:26 <michelled> kavya: those names are placeholders
2017-02-13T16:09:35 <michelled> they are supposed to be replaced with snapsets
2017-02-13T16:09:54 <michelled> I know that the UX team is still working through the snapsets
2017-02-13T16:10:07 <michelled> these snapsets will work differently than a regular user account
2017-02-13T16:10:34 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-02-13T16:11:02 <michelled> if it would help, I could put in placeholder snapserts? I was holding out so that we don\'t have to do the work twice.
2017-02-13T16:11:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I so want a snapsert, it\'s sounds like a crisp, minty cookie.
2017-02-13T16:12:16 <michelled> ha! I think we could arrange that too :)
2017-02-13T16:12:38 <kavya> Michelle: Could you tell me the difference between placeholders and snapsets?
2017-02-13T16:13:30 <michelled> kavya: what I mean by placeholder is an interim, no vetted, solution
2017-02-13T16:14:32 <michelled> kavya: the snapsets are going to be groupings of settings that a user could try out as a starting point for their optimization
2017-02-13T16:17:59 <michelled> kavya: in a very ancient version of UI Options, one of the designers had toyed with some of these options such as \'high visualization\' and \'comfort\'  https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Interface+Options+Wireframes+-+Iteration+1
2017-02-13T16:18:11 <michelled> we decided not to go this route, but I think snapsets are along the same idea
2017-02-13T16:20:13 <kavya> ok..now i think i understood why we have different behavior for other users
2017-02-13T16:20:35 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-02-13T16:21:04 <colinclark> Last I saw, the "composition" of the snapsets (i.e. exactly which settings will be collected togeher under a given snapset name) hadn\'t yet been settled on, but they will contain things like magnification, font size, line spacing, screen scaling mouse pointer size, highlight and TTS, layout simplification, and so on.
2017-02-13T16:21:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure - it even has test cases!
2017-02-13T16:22:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so it seems that it rounds away from zero
2017-02-13T16:22:20 <Bosmon> Although you\'re stuck having to decide which direction it rounds in
2017-02-13T16:22:20 <Bosmon> Yes
2017-02-13T16:22:24 <Justin_o> which i guess is fine, i\'ll just leave a comment and some documentation about it
2017-02-13T16:22:39 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2017-02-13T16:23:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also i think i can just adapt this one line https://github.com/sindresorhus/round-to/blob/master/index.js#L17
2017-02-13T16:24:14 <Justin_o> it\'s MIT Licensed do i just need to leave a comment and point to this repo? Or something more?

2017-02-13T17:46:46 <colinclark> ok, jhernandez, gloob_, michelled, talk to me about "config modes" for HST
2017-02-13T17:47:04 <colinclark> what mode do we currently run the GPII in for the HST tests?
2017-02-13T17:47:19 * yzen joined the channel
2017-02-13T17:47:37 <gloob_> I have a pending reply to an issue, right?
2017-02-13T17:47:40 <gloob_> question is
2017-02-13T17:49:02 <gloob> we are talking about this https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/hst-2017/configs/app.json#L13
2017-02-13T17:49:05 <gloob> no?
2017-02-13T17:50:24 <gloob> the problem come from the device reporter, jhernandez made the suggestions, I will let him to explain his rationale
2017-02-13T17:51:07 <michelled> colinclark: as gloob linked to, the \'dr.production\' config
2017-02-13T17:51:18 <michelled> here\'s the textual explanation : https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.all.development.dr.production.txt
2017-02-13T17:51:23 <jhernandez> oh
2017-02-13T17:51:53 <jhernandez> that\'s because we agreed on using the dynamic device reporter by default
2017-02-13T17:52:25 <michelled> jhernandez: do you mean by default for the app? or by default for hst testing?
2017-02-13T17:52:32 <michelled> I wasn\'t in the conversation where this was talked about
2017-02-13T17:52:34 <gloob> sorry but I need to take care of Luc\xc3\xada for these two hours...
2017-02-13T17:53:03 <colinclark> ok, so is it fairly trivial to write some kind of context check in order to not render the "snapset" menu in this context?
2017-02-13T17:53:24 <michelled> yep
2017-02-13T17:53:32 <colinclark> you know how to, michelled?
2017-02-13T17:53:57 <michelled> well, I know it will be trivial - but I haven\'t used our context awareness yet
2017-02-13T17:54:00 <michelled> :)
2017-02-13T17:54:02 <jhernandez> well, this decision came long time ago, and it applies to the installer

2017-02-13T17:54:21 <colinclark> cindyli could maybe help, michelled?
2017-02-13T17:54:25 <colinclark> she seems to know a lot about these sorts of thigns
2017-02-13T17:55:00 <cindyli> catching up ..
2017-02-13T17:55:10 <colinclark> the short version, cindyli:
2017-02-13T17:55:30 <colinclark> we\'ve been asked to not render the menu in the GPII that shows the different preference set names, in the context of HST testing
2017-02-13T17:55:32 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-02-13T17:55:37 <colinclark> but I think the menu is VERY helpful for development
2017-02-13T17:55:43 <michelled> jhernandez, colinclark: so do we want to ship the app with a default of everything in development mode except for the device reporter?
2017-02-13T17:56:13 <colinclark> so we\'ll want to have some kind of contextual-sensitivity in which the menu is not rendered in production mode
2017-02-13T17:56:47 <jhernandez> michelled: yes, this way we won\'t try to i.e.: configure and launch jaws (or nvda, or read&write gold, etc) if it\'s not installed
2017-02-13T17:56:49 <michelled> it might make more sense, then, to use production mode for hst - don\'t you think?
2017-02-13T17:56:57 <colinclark> I guess it\'s a kind of "production mode" for the app, perhaps
2017-02-13T17:57:11 <cindyli> colinclark, michelled, i think 2 ways to do it
2017-02-13T17:57:18 <cindyli> 1. distributeOptions
2017-02-13T17:57:33 <cindyli> only distribute the menu when gpii runs in the dev mode
2017-02-13T17:57:43 <cindyli> 2. context awareness
2017-02-13T17:57:50 <cindyli> i think 1 might be easier
