2017-03-15T14:36:59 <stegru> cindyli: Here\'s my initial research about the service/child thing: https://github.com/stegru/service-poc
2017-03-15T14:37:32 <cindyli> ah, thanks, stegru, adding it to the wiki
2017-03-15T14:37:42 <stegru> summary: creating a child process works well, the pipes need some work
2017-03-15T14:38:22 <cindyli> ok
2017-03-15T14:39:10 <stegru> gloob, javjarfer: FYI ^
2017-03-15T14:41:40 * clown joined the channel
2017-03-15T14:44:50 <javjarfer> stegru, thanks you! Looks like good news, will be a good starting point when we start to port the future C# service to fluid infusion
2017-03-15T14:48:05 <javjarfer> oh! sorry Bosmon, I wasn\'t here when you asked: *are those dates still good for you?*. Yes they are, thanks for asking!
2017-03-15T15:07:42 <gloob> stegru: are we going to infusionize this?

2017-03-15T15:24:06 <Bosmon> gloob - well, it will just become "a bunch of global functions" : P
2017-03-15T15:25:02 <Bosmon> I guess perhaps not very much code will execute on the service side
2017-03-15T15:25:17 <Bosmon> And so it could become a pure node module if there isn\'t any of the architecture required
2017-03-15T15:38:00 <gloob> Bosmon: yeah, I was wondering if it\'ll makes sense or not
2017-03-15T15:38:15 <gloob> besides the I publish this in my namespace integration
2017-03-15T15:38:40 <Bosmon> We were on the verge of running into a similar issue when stegru wrote a little "mini-program" to isolate us from race conditions in calling SPI
2017-03-15T15:38:49 <Bosmon> But thankfully we were able to axe that program
2017-03-15T15:38:59 <gloob> hehe
2017-03-15T15:51:41 <stegru> no, that was re-introduced Bosmon, to fix GPII-2001.. the spi freezing
2017-03-15T15:55:54 * avtar joined the channel
2017-03-15T15:59:33 <Bosmon> stegru - right, but it\'s not a separate node process, right?
2017-03-15T15:59:51 <stegru> yes, it is
2017-03-15T16:00:36 <gloob> oh no
2017-03-15T16:00:43 <stegru> Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/src/SpiSettingsHandler.js#L156
2017-03-15T16:01:13 <stegru> all it does is invoke SystemParameterInfo
2017-03-15T16:01:31 <stegru> the child process: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/src/SpiChildProcess.js
2017-03-15T16:01:32 <Bosmon> wow
2017-03-15T16:01:36 <Bosmon> MAD HAPPES
2017-03-15T16:01:41 <Bosmon> My memory completely played me false
2017-03-15T16:01:56 <Bosmon> Well, there we go
2017-03-15T16:02:02 <Bosmon> We have prior form for "tiny Infusion-less processes"
2017-03-15T16:02:14 <clown> kasparnet:  is the arch meeting now, or an hour from now?
2017-03-15T16:02:24 <stegru> it\'s now clown
2017-03-15T16:02:24 <kasparnet> clown: it\'s now :)
2017-03-15T16:02:29 * clown is on daylight savings time here.
2017-03-15T16:02:43 <Bosmon> I guess reflecting the fact that we are no longer an EU-led project.......
2017-03-15T16:02:43 <clown> thanks stegru kasparnet.  on my way...
2017-03-15T16:02:54 <stegru> clown: don\'t worry, i also forgot
2017-03-15T16:04:16 <clown> stegru:   What?  Me Worry?

2017-03-15T16:36:05 <colinclark> I have Carla Rice and the BiT crew visiting at 1 pm
2017-03-15T16:36:13 <colinclark> I wonder if there\'s someone else we can send to listen in?
2017-03-15T16:36:24 <colinclark> Justin_o or Caren, maybe?
