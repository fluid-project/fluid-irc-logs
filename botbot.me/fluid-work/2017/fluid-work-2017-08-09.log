2017-08-09T12:51:03 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: anyone able to approve my e-mail to the GPII architecture list. It's being held for moderation because I included the UIO+ browser extension for testing
2017-08-09T12:51:56 <stegru> I've received two from you today
2017-08-09T12:52:14 <stegru> now 3
2017-08-09T12:54:19 <stegru> no attachment, you might want to upload it to something like google drive, Justin_o
2017-08-09T12:54:39 <Justin_o> stegru: i was going to put it on JIRA, but for some reason JIRA doesn't want to accept it today :(
2017-08-09T12:54:53 <Justin_o> but yah, maybe i'll add it to my cloud drive
2017-08-09T12:54:57 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-08-09T12:55:40 <stegru> i had a similar problem today, not allowed to email a .bat file
2017-08-09T12:56:57 <Justin_o> :( i guess it's better to be safe
2017-08-09T12:57:46 <jhernandez> stegru, Justin_o: who do you think you are to redistribute random binaries?! xDDD
2017-08-09T12:59:14 <jhernandez> Justin_o: FYI I received the mail with the attached crx file
2017-08-09T12:59:53 <stegru> that's not fair, i didn't
2017-08-09T13:00:04 <stegru> oh! i did
2017-08-09T13:00:30 <stegru> i was expecting a paper-clip picture somewhere
2017-08-09T13:01:28 <Justin_o> jhernandez, stegru: glad it went through, if your computers stop working, it wasn't me ;)
2017-08-09T13:02:10 <stegru> ahh.. i use an extension (not yours) to make the page darker, so i couldn't see the paper-clip
2017-08-09T13:04:32 <Justin_o> ah okay, it was camouflaged

2017-08-09T16:51:41 <stegru> jhernandez: do you have this build from friday that I can have?
2017-08-09T16:51:52 <stegru> i just realised i've been using the wrong one
2017-08-09T16:53:26 <jhernandez> stegru: I built another one on Monday, which is the one that kavya is testing right now
2017-08-09T16:53:31 <stegru> ok
2017-08-09T16:53:37 <jhernandez> do you want that one instead?
2017-08-09T16:53:41 <stegru> yes
2017-08-09T16:54:02 <stegru> it would be nice if you uploaded them somewhere for me to find, so i don't need to ask you
2017-08-09T16:54:11 <stegru> but, i guess you like to feel important :)
2017-08-09T16:54:39 <jhernandez> hahaha
2017-08-09T16:54:42 <stegru> ta
2017-08-09T16:54:51 <jhernandez> you can build it yourself
2017-08-09T16:55:18 <jhernandez> it's the result of building this pull request: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/19
2017-08-09T16:55:22 <stegru> ah ok
2017-08-09T16:56:10 <jhernandez> in any case, I've just shared the download link with you
2017-08-09T16:56:12 <jhernandez> ;)
2017-08-09T16:56:19 <stegru> yeh got it, ta
2017-08-09T16:56:21 <stegru> thanks
2017-08-09T16:56:31 <jhernandez> yw
2017-08-09T16:57:13 <stegru> i will keep a closer eye on the PR in future

2017-08-09T17:01:12 <jhernandez> yeah, this is what should land in hst-2017 after the pr passes CI

2017-08-09T18:33:55 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks, i'll take a look
2017-08-09T18:34:07 <grrrero> Thanks Justin_o
2017-08-09T18:35:08 <Justin_o> grrrero: ah, looks like you based this branch off of a FLUID-5534 branch instead of master, so it includes changes for that as well. Would you be able to recreate this off of master instead so that only the changes for FLUID-5879 are present. If not, we'll have to put this one in after FLUID-5534 is finished and merged.
2017-08-09T18:36:49 <grrrero> Oh Justin_o sorry about that
2017-08-09T18:37:28 <michelled> grrrero: you could try to cherry pick your commits
2017-08-09T18:37:37 <michelled> it might work quite easily
2017-08-09T18:37:40 <michelled> I can help
2017-08-09T18:37:45 <grrrero> Oh awesome thanks michelled :)

2017-08-09T19:16:35 <colinclark> or 13 and 10 if you speak decimal
2017-08-09T19:16:37 <colinclark> exactly as you said
2017-08-09T19:18:39 <Justin_o> grrrero: i left a couple of comments on your PR

2017-08-09T20:06:35 <grrrero> Justin_o: when I try to leave a space between the function & args it throws an error :\\
2017-08-09T20:15:26 <colinclark> grrrero: Given that your function is defined in a different, I'm not sure of the merits of following a styling convention from JavaScript ;)
2017-08-09T20:16:32 <colinclark> Especially since Stylus' syntax for anonymous functions is unambiguously different from named functions
2017-08-09T20:16:32 <grrrero> colinclark: It is a stylus function and it was complaining about it so \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf
2017-08-09T20:16:36 <colinclark> right
2017-08-09T20:16:45 <colinclark> I think it's not syntactically correct :)
2017-08-09T20:17:30 <colinclark> Hence I think your approach of using the correct function definition syntax is a good one :)
2017-08-09T20:39:21 <gtirloni> speaking of named functions, are we accepting ES6 code at this time?
2017-08-09T20:39:56 <gtirloni> that popped in my mind while i wait for gpii-app tests to run :)
