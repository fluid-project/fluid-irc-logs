2017-12-19T16:05:55 <kavya> jhernandez: Hi..just checking if we have  new installer build  ready with all listeners for testing
2017-12-19T16:07:13 * Caren joined the channel
2017-12-19T16:07:48 <jhernandez> kavya: hey, I\'m about to re-test the branch with the last changes from stegru, since yesterday we found out that there was a problem with the usb listener
2017-12-19T16:10:08 <jhernandez> I\'ll create an installer for you to test as soon as I\'m done with it
2017-12-19T16:13:08 <kavya> ok..thanks Javi
2017-12-19T16:13:55 <stegru> I fixed it, by the way
2017-12-19T16:14:49 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru! How is going the research about the FFI for windows settings?
2017-12-19T16:14:55 <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning is starting soon
2017-12-19T16:15:38 <stegru> I\'ve hardly done anything, javjarfer[m]
2017-12-19T16:15:56 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'m re-npm installing now
2017-12-19T16:16:34 <jhernandez> but I\'m sure you fixed it
2017-12-19T16:16:37 <javjarfer[m]> okay! Just wanted to know it was giving you difficulties
2017-12-19T16:16:38 <jhernandez> for reeeel!

2017-12-19T16:46:43 <stegru> jhernandez: about the "meat" comment.. I can only link to the commit (or my branch), because it\'s not in universal yet.. the link will therefor point to old code
2017-12-19T16:56:01 <jhernandez> stegru: right
2017-12-19T16:56:38 <jhernandez> I guess that you can  also add a "link to the future"
2017-12-19T16:56:43 * Caren joined the channel
2017-12-19T16:57:32 <jhernandez> up to you, it doesn\'t bother me since I do know where the meat lives
2017-12-19T16:58:31 <jhernandez> but if you want to reference it, you can just add a link to the universals\' user listener readme without a specific commit hash
2017-12-19T16:58:58 <jhernandez> which  won\'t work  until  the universal  side is  merged

2017-12-19T17:20:34 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru ! Did you had time for taking a look to my internationalization pull? The ones from https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/578 and https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/158/, sorry if I didn\'t give you any details before, also I know you have been busy with the USB so maybe you didn\'t needed until now
2017-12-19T17:30:20 <jhernandez> kavya: I\'ve just shared an installer with you
2017-12-19T17:30:54 <javjarfer[m]> have anyone noticed that linter fails several times in detecting non defined variables names?
2017-12-19T17:31:05 <jhernandez> it includes  master branches of everything  + stegru\'s GPII-2294,  so don\'t expect, i.e. the PSP to be there
2017-12-19T17:32:29 <jhernandez> let me or stegru know if you have any questions/doubts regarding this work
2017-12-19T17:32:31 <jhernandez> ;)
2017-12-19T17:32:38 * danayo has quit
2017-12-19T17:33:12 <javjarfer[m]> Sometimes I don\'t get any warnings when I pass it, but I\'m indeed wrongly using a mistyped variable name for example
2017-12-19T17:33:33 <kavya> just got your email..will start testing and let you know if i have questions
2017-12-19T17:33:42 <kavya> thanks Javi and Steve
2017-12-19T17:33:45 <jhernandez> kavya: nice
2017-12-19T17:34:40 <jhernandez> the mostt noticeable thing is that we  don\'t have to run the user listeners in different  processes  anymore,  theey\'re  part of the gpii base code
2017-12-19T17:35:02 <jhernandez> thanks to super stegru!
