2017-05-08T17:59:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @amatas.  I just paid to upgrade my home network, I can download that and attend the call.
2017-05-08T17:59:18 <the-t-in-rtf> So worth it.
2017-05-08T17:59:35 <gloob> fuhhh, do you have cap?
2017-05-08T17:59:53 <amatas> can you change your bandwith in real time?
2017-05-08T18:00:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Sure, just download more stuff, and the bandwidth goes down for everything else.
2017-05-08T18:00:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, no, they just have fiber to the neighborhood now
2017-05-08T18:00:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I can get up to 500Mbit, but I\'m paying for 300Mb
2017-05-08T18:00:54 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, MB
2017-05-08T18:01:00 <gloob> 300MB symmetrical here
2017-05-08T18:01:02 <gloob> no cap
2017-05-08T18:01:16 <amatas> fiber is the best, I have 200MB now, and planning to upgrade to 300 symmetrical
2017-05-08T18:01:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t think there\'s a cap, but I need to rent the fine print
2017-05-08T18:01:38 <the-t-in-rtf> this is a three month trial, I\'ve only had it for a few days
2017-05-08T18:01:42 <the-t-in-rtf> pretty sure I\'m keeping it.
