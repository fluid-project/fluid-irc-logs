2017-09-11T16:41:43 * clown looks
2017-09-11T16:43:12 <jhernandez> they are related to tests from both the processReporter and eventLogger

2017-09-11T16:51:25 <jhernandez> wrt the problem with the failing processReporter test
2017-09-11T16:51:32 <jhernandez> the electron.exe.exe one
2017-09-11T16:52:17 <clown> yes, but there\'s also a failure earlier than that one where it can\'t find the running node process
2017-09-11T16:54:47 <gtirloni> Bosmon: yes, very easy (re: linting). i\'ll submit a PR later today for that
2017-09-11T16:56:09 <clown> jhernandez:  just to confirm, you want to use "https://github.com/javihernandez/windows/tree/GPII-2084" ?
2017-09-11T16:56:58 <jhernandez> clown: no, that was included into windows/hst-2017 already
2017-09-11T17:00:01 <clown> okay, well that\'s the branch that pull 24 references.  Anyhow, I don\'t see an hst-2017 branch in your repo .  There are seven hst-2017-xxx though.  Which one?
2017-09-11T17:00:46 <jhernandez> clown: you should just use my gpii-app/GPII-2084 branch

2017-09-11T19:28:21 <grrrero> Justin_o: I think it\'s because we\'re now using "visibility", which doesn\'t totally remove the object in the page... I dunno, still mulling over it
2017-09-11T19:28:46 <grrrero> When you first load, the div that contains flc-slidingPanel-panel flc-prefsEditor-iframe the height gets calculated as 17px or something then animates it back down to 0
2017-09-11T19:29:20 <Justin_o> grrrero: i guess we should aim to figure out if we can get that height 0 set to start and remove the annimation
2017-09-11T19:29:30 <Justin_o> if you are able to figure out where that is coming from

2017-09-11T08:57:40 <dandimitrov> Hi, everyone, is anyone familiar with keeping IOCSS expressions (e.g. "{that}.model.value") as plain strings in component properties? - I want to dynamically pass such strings as part of options to a child component and only then to be evaluated...
2017-09-11T08:58:35 <dandimitrov> Or should we generally avoid this approach?
2017-09-11T08:58:51 <stegru> dandimitrov: try: "@expand:{that}.model.value"
2017-09-11T08:59:21 <stegru> i\'m not saying it works, but that\'s what i would try
2017-09-11T09:00:45 <dandimitrov> stegry: like in - `{ ...., childOptions: { model: { val: "@expand:{that}.model.value" } }, components: ... }` ?
2017-09-11T09:02:55 <stegru> oh, not i don\'t think it would work inside a model

2017-09-11T09:26:48 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov
2017-09-11T09:27:10 <Bosmon> You can prevent such expressions being expanded by use of a mergePolicy of "noexpand"
2017-09-11T09:27:16 <Bosmon> This approach is fine and is used quite often
2017-09-11T09:29:37 <Bosmon> Here\'s an example from the framework\'s own code: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/enhancement/js/ContextAwareness.js#L113
2017-09-11T09:30:45 <Bosmon> Or from the preferences framework: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/AuxBuilder.js#L412
2017-09-11T09:32:14 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-09-11T09:35:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry I missed your earlier comment @dandimitrov, Model Relay is definitely the way to pass around values that are likely to change and/or be removed.
2017-09-11T09:36:29 <the-t-in-rtf> There are also mechanisms for avoiding expansion of IoC references.
2017-09-11T09:36:47 <the-t-in-rtf> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/OptionsMerging.html
2017-09-11T09:37:04 <the-t-in-rtf> You can specify which component options are "noexpand", i.e. which are treated as raw JSON.
2017-09-11T09:37:26 <the-t-in-rtf> You should talk through your use case a bit more.
2017-09-11T09:37:50 <the-t-in-rtf> it may be that there are cleaner patterns for instantiating components that might help you.
2017-09-11T09:38:04 <the-t-in-rtf> (I mean dynamic components)

2017-09-11T13:28:20 <grrrero> Justin_o: So I discovered something quirky when I changed the prefsFramework demo to use UIO -- In MS Edge when you first reload the page the panel shows up fine but when you close it and open it, on the 3rd try it starts cutting it off again and never works properly again
2017-09-11T13:28:40 <Justin_o> hmm.. that\'s intersting
2017-09-11T13:28:54 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-09-11T13:28:54 <Justin_o> so you open, close, open and it\'s cut off?
2017-09-11T13:29:06 <grrrero> Justin_o: Yeah, on the 3rd try
2017-09-11T13:33:42 <Justin_o> and that\'s without making any changes to the preferences?
2017-09-11T13:33:48 <grrrero> Yeah
2017-09-11T13:34:13 <Justin_o> grrrero: and in the prefs framework demo before it would always work?
2017-09-11T13:34:40 <grrrero> Good question -- I don\'t know if I\'ve ever tried opening/closing it more than 3 times
2017-09-11T13:34:54 <grrrero> Trying it now
2017-09-11T13:35:55 <Justin_o> grrrero: thanks
2017-09-11T13:35:57 <grrrero> Justin_o: Ahhh... on the 2nd try it cuts it off.

2017-09-11T13:39:20 <Justin_o> grrrero: okay, hmm.. i wonder if there is something different about the timing or something else about how we are instantiating them. Which causes it to work the first time, but not the second.. and causes it work on reset..
2017-09-11T13:39:38 <Justin_o> but it does seem less like a css issue and more like a code problem now

2017-09-11T14:09:03 <gtirloni_> Justin_o: i enabled it for the inclusive-design org (the only one I have access to change that) and then asked JIRA to refresh the list of repositories... it seemed to work fine.
2017-09-11T14:09:12 <gtirloni_> worst case scenario, we just reset the oauth settings in JIRA
2017-09-11T14:10:47 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: okay, let me give it a shot..

2017-09-11T14:14:49 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: i updated fluid-project, trying to refresh the repos in JIRA now
2017-09-11T14:14:56 <Justin_o> seems to be okay

2017-09-11T14:18:35 <gtirloni_> Bosmon colinclark jhernandez: as owners of the GPII org, if you feel like it\'s a good idea to enable restrictions on 3rd-party apps, I\'ve detailed the steps in my email to architecture@ list

2017-09-11T14:50:53 <Bosmon> Hey there jhernandez - is all ok for gpii-app now?
2017-09-11T14:51:17 <jhernandez> gtirloni: it seems, in theory, looks like ... you really convinced me :)
2017-09-11T14:51:42 <gtirloni> jhernandez: i\'m 100% sure that maybe it won\'t cause any issues :)
2017-09-11T14:52:18 <Bosmon> gtirloni - seems reasonable to me
2017-09-11T14:52:32 <jhernandez> Bosmon: apparently, yes, but I\'m getting a couple of problems when running tests locally
2017-09-11T14:53:01 <jhernandez> just issued a pull request to have a ci pass before updating windows/hst-2017
