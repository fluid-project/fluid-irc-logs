2017-08-30T20:22:55 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-08-30T20:23:02 <javjarfer> mmm that is consistently failing here
2017-08-30T20:23:32 <stegru> none image -> black, image -> image
2017-08-30T20:23:33 <javjarfer> I\'m doing image -> folder -> same image
2017-08-30T20:23:43 <javjarfer> jut black
2017-08-30T20:24:20 <stegru> and, i\'ve just done this:
2017-08-30T20:24:25 <stegru> [wallpaper]::SetWallpaper("C:\\windows\\Web\\Wallpaper\\Theme1\\img2.jpg")
2017-08-30T20:24:25 <stegru> [wallpaper]::SetWallpaper("C:\\windows\\Web\\Wallpaper\\Theme1\\")
2017-08-30T20:24:25 <stegru> [wallpaper]::SetWallpaper("C:\\windows\\Web\\Wallpaper\\Theme1\\img2.jpg")
2017-08-30T20:24:35 <stegru> and it works.. i get a flash of black
2017-08-30T20:26:33 <javjarfer> okay, well, remove the last \\ form the path
2017-08-30T20:26:39 <javjarfer> from the folder path*
2017-08-30T20:26:52 <stegru> ahh
2017-08-30T20:27:10 <javjarfer> and now?
2017-08-30T20:27:13 <stegru> yes!
2017-08-30T20:27:16 <stegru> just black
2017-08-30T20:27:18 <javjarfer> hahahahah
2017-08-30T20:28:04 <javjarfer> wo... at the end... at least I can go bed knowing where this came from
2017-08-30T20:28:49 <javjarfer> well, I guess that with this kind of behavior the unique thing we can do is to parse, and check the path before setting
2017-08-30T20:30:01 <javjarfer> I will cherry pick that commit and make this using that, and check how the path ends tomorrow
2017-08-30T20:30:13 <javjarfer> and see if we can move forward from this xD
2017-08-30T20:30:28 <javjarfer> thanks you so much stegru

b'2017-08-30T17:11:45 <alanharnum> that is to say, the eternal conversation about system changes :)
2017-08-30T17:12:56 <alanharnum> even spending time on assessing the viability of the change and the cost of the migration is time that can be hard to spare, but i think it\'s important to keep having these conversations
2017-08-30T17:14:23 <ussjoin> Well, we know that Slack has several significant advantages, both for technical and nontechnical users. It seems like there are potential downfalls, though gtirloni addressed the largest.
2017-08-30T17:15:34 <alanharnum> my own sense (which I was Slack was talking about more publicly, I have to hunt for this stuff / read between lines) is that they will fairly soon hit a point where they are more comfortable making statements about the product\'s general accessibility, especially in regards to screen readers.
2017-08-30T17:16:03 <alanharnum> accessibility remains my biggest hard stop.
2017-08-30T17:16:36 <ussjoin> OK. Do you have a screen reader you\'d recommend for me to try with Slack?
2017-08-30T17:17:02 <alanharnum> ussjoin: what OS are you on?
2017-08-30T17:17:05 <ussjoin> OSX.
2017-08-30T17:17:07 <gtirloni> what puzzles me is why that a11y community is using Slack, how they justified it to themselves and how are criteria differ
2017-08-30T17:17:33 <gtirloni> s/are/our
2017-08-30T17:18:19 <alanharnum> ussjoin: VoiceOver (the built-in one) should be fine - it\'s definitely a valuable experience
2017-08-30T17:18:35 <gtirloni> to be fair, it seems they are more exploratory in nature
2017-08-30T17:19:28 <alanharnum> gtirloni ussjoin: they actually have a #slack-a11y-feedback channel there, which George Zamfir (the Slack accessibility product owner) posts to sometimes
2017-08-30T17:19:38 * georgitodorov has quit
2017-08-30T17:19:44 <alanharnum> it\'s one of the better sources I\'ve found for information on current state of Slack a11y
2017-08-30T17:20:46 <gtirloni> ussjoin: it might be better to start a thread in fluid-work@fluidproject.org and architecture@lists.gpii.net lists with some findings
2017-08-30T17:21:07 <stegru> what\'s wrong with IRC?
2017-08-30T17:21:19 <ussjoin> alanharnum: Voiceover seems to work with Slack, though it seems somewhat unknowing of what\'s worth reading in both IRC and Slack.
2017-08-30T17:21:24 <alanharnum> it\'s free to join via https://web-a11y.herokuapp.com/ - i\'d recommend joining the #slack-a11y-feedback and just asking there directly about current state of things
2017-08-30T17:21:29 <gtirloni> stegru: vs discussing it on the mailing list? not everybody is here
2017-08-30T17:21:42 <stegru> i mean, vs slack
2017-08-30T17:21:44 <stegru> sorry
2017-08-30T17:21:58 <ussjoin> stegru: The three I mentioned above were "1) Lack of scrollback/unified context; 2) Ease of use (particularly for not-primarily-technical users); 3) Fear of Missing Out on conversations that happen while one is offline (or has a network blip)."
2017-08-30T17:22:05 <stegru> oh wait.. that also answers it
2017-08-30T17:22:38 <stegru> ok
2017-08-30T17:22:50 <alanharnum> I\'d add a 4) to that - "Slack has a really good API for integrations of other tools"
2017-08-30T17:22:57 <amatas> well at least this channel is logged so you can see the logs at botbot.me
2017-08-30T17:23:23 <stegru> irc doesn\'t need an API
2017-08-30T17:23:30 <gtirloni> I didn\'t know Slack had an IRC gateway, that\'s new -- https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connect-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP
2017-08-30T17:23:38 <ussjoin> amatas: Yes, although crosslinking to previous / other channel conversations is somewhat difficult.
2017-08-30T17:23:48 <ussjoin> stegru: ? IRC is a protocol?
2017-08-30T17:23:50 <alanharnum> gtirloni: yeah, it\'s much improved in the last year or so
2017-08-30T17:24:11 <stegru> exactly, ussjoin.. the protocol *is* the API
2017-08-30T17:24:30 <amatas> the last time I used the slack client for linux it burned my CPU
2017-08-30T17:24:32 <ussjoin> stegru: I don\'t understand?
2017-08-30T17:24:38 <stegru> exactly, amatas
2017-08-30T17:24:56 <ussjoin> amatas: It also works as a webpage.
2017-08-30T17:25:07 <stegru> ussjoin: i mean, if i wanted to make something that reads or sends messages to IRC, i use the protocol.
2017-08-30T17:25:19 <ussjoin> Right. How is that different than using an API?
2017-08-30T17:25:31 <stegru> it\'s not.. that was my point
2017-08-30T17:25:39 <amatas> at least is useful in winter
2017-08-30T17:26:19 <gtirloni> I feel like we don\'t have to make it a definitive decision. If we setup Slack, add an IRC bridge (with its limitations) and let people choose... if nobody is using Slack directly, turn it off... if most people are, reevaluate IRC. It\'s not that difficult to switch back.
2017-08-30T17:26:51 <stegru> i just like having a choice in client
2017-08-30T17:26:55 * yuriy has quit
2017-08-30T17:27:01 <ussjoin> stegru: Why?
2017-08-30T17:27:28 <stegru> why not?
2017-08-30T17:27:32 <alanharnum> anyway, i have to go dark on this conversation now for other work - but I think if we wanted to explore this, setting it up with the IRC bridge as gtirloni suggests would be a good option. IRC bridge is super-easy to setup.
2017-08-30T17:27:35 <ussjoin> I\'m curious: is that a philosophical argument, or is switching clients something you do often?
2017-08-30T17:27:55 <stegru> well, let\'s say the Slack client is shit
2017-08-30T17:28:19 <ussjoin> OK. Well, thank you all for your thoughts.
2017-08-30T17:28:27 <ussjoin> Very much appreciate the conversation.
2017-08-30T17:28:29 <amatas> stegru: https://github.com/necrosis/slack-libpurple but I didn\'t test jet

2017-08-30T17:35:47 * amatas joined the channel
2017-08-30T17:41:41 <javjarfer> I agree with that, if we can bridge both, that would be cool, as stegru said, freedom for choosing a client is also important for me
2017-08-30T17:44:13 <javjarfer> ussjoin, what do you think of matrix?
2017-08-30T17:44:38 <ussjoin> I have to ask: what is the matrix?
2017-08-30T17:44:57 <javjarfer> is the new protocol replacing IRC and has also backward compatibility with IRC
2017-08-30T17:45:39 <javjarfer> there are several clients out there, most famous one I think is this one: https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/riot.html
2017-08-30T17:45:46 <ussjoin> Ah, yes, I know Riot.
2017-08-30T17:46:42 <ussjoin> So the issue I would raise there is that we would have to set up, support, and defend that as part of our infrastructure.
2017-08-30T17:48:51 <stegru> actually, the slack client has improved now
2017-08-30T17:49:06 <javjarfer> So, you point is that integration with the features that you want will be harder than with Slack no?

2017-08-30T18:53:45 <javjarfer> hi! Just wanted to ask you if you see something strange here: https://github.com/JavierJF/windows/blob/hst-2017/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/src/SpiSettingsHandler.js#L200
2017-08-30T18:54:18 <javjarfer> that could be triggering the weird behavior of the wallpaper, like the \'resetting\' not using the same flags as the setting
2017-08-30T19:04:15 <stegru> i don\'t see anything strange, javjarfer
2017-08-30T19:04:30 <javjarfer> mmm okay, thanks you
2017-08-30T19:04:59 <javjarfer> I\'m going to make a little script and reproduce the behavior outside gpii
2017-08-30T19:05:04 <stegru> why don\'t you try to manually call systemParametersInfo?
2017-08-30T19:05:12 <javjarfer> read my mind
2017-08-30T19:05:14 <stegru> heh
2017-08-30T19:05:30 <javjarfer> thanks! doing that
2017-08-30T19:11:16 <stegru> oh javjarfer , if you want fWinIni you could look at this: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/115/commits/e741956ff79a6774a72dafd084eb5fd7425fbc3a

2017-08-30T19:19:50 <javjarfer> need to modify that them...

2017-08-30T19:40:05 <javjarfer> stegru, you can use that for seeing the weird behavior of miss setting the correct wallpaper https://gist.github.com/JavierJF/9c103dda613cf622bb6728d03df8122e
2017-08-30T19:40:34 <javjarfer> ussjoin, today I had that paranoid being inside a VM
2017-08-30T19:42:14 * kasparnet has quit
2017-08-30T19:42:16 <javjarfer> stegru, probably we can\'t do nothing about that, settings are restored correctly but not showed up due to the irresponsiveness of the windows desktop manager
2017-08-30T19:43:27 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-08-30T19:43:48 <javjarfer> so I\'m going to change for using the SPI flags with the code you have passed me (thanks, didn\'t saw that part from that file) and close that, I will leave a comment that having black background in cases of failing is expected behavior
2017-08-30T19:44:30 <javjarfer> oooor we can verify the paths, and also verify that there is a valid image in that path before passing it to the Windows API
2017-08-30T19:53:37 * simonjb has quit
2017-08-30T19:54:27 <stegru> that code isn\'t in master, you\'ll have to cherry-pick the commit
2017-08-30T19:55:41 <stegru> ussjoin: I\'ve actually once created a bug related to that
2017-08-30T19:56:17 <stegru> what should that ps1 file do, javjarfer?
2017-08-30T19:56:24 <stegru> i mean, what\'s the strange thing
2017-08-30T19:57:18 <javjarfer> execute it with a correct path
2017-08-30T19:57:41 <javjarfer> see the wallpaper change, then execute it with another correct path, see the wallpaper change again
2017-08-30T19:58:14 <javjarfer> use a wrong path, see the background go black, execute with a correct path
2017-08-30T19:58:29 <javjarfer> see the background remains black, it\'s magic!!!
2017-08-30T19:59:15 <javjarfer> stegru, that maybe explain not seeing it, will be good idea to cherry pick it?
2017-08-30T19:59:59 <stegru> yes, otherwise it will clash when the 2nd one gets merged
2017-08-30T20:01:11 <stegru> yes, otherwise it will clash when the 2nd one gets merged
2017-08-30T20:01:13 <stegru> oops
2017-08-30T20:02:05 <stegru> so when i run it with a file that exists, it always works.. but a non-existing file it goes black
2017-08-30T20:06:34 <stegru> it sets it to whatever colour the background is, in control panel
2017-08-30T20:07:54 <javjarfer> yes, and recover itself with arbitrary timing after the fail
2017-08-30T20:08:07 <stegru> i didn\'t notice that
2017-08-30T20:08:35 <javjarfer> did you try setting another one after it went black?
2017-08-30T20:08:46 <stegru> yes
2017-08-30T20:08:48 <javjarfer> sometimes it works, but sometimes remains black a time
2017-08-30T20:09:19 <javjarfer> the actual wallpaper it set, but the background doesn\'t shows up that wallpaper
2017-08-30T20:11:11 <stegru> nope
2017-08-30T20:11:55 <stegru> i\'ve repeated "existing" "non-existing" ... and it just goes "image" "black", without anything unusual
2017-08-30T20:13:27 <javjarfer> and goes back to image when you reset an image in a normal way?
2017-08-30T20:13:57 <javjarfer> yes, I think you mean that
2017-08-30T20:14:07 <stegru> yes
2017-08-30T20:14:12 <javjarfer> okay, that is weird, mine is failing with that right now
2017-08-30T20:14:13 <stegru> it must be you
2017-08-30T20:14:48 <javjarfer> I LOVE SO MUCH this kind of determinism
2017-08-30T20:15:06 <stegru> welcome to SystemParametersInfo!
2017-08-30T20:15:12 <javjarfer> xDDDD
2017-08-30T20:17:01 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-08-30T20:17:05 <javjarfer> okay okay
2017-08-30T20:17:11 <javjarfer> try setting it to a folder
2017-08-30T20:17:22 <javjarfer> a path not ended in .jpg
2017-08-30T20:17:39 <javjarfer> hahaha this thing is the worst
2017-08-30T20:17:58 <stegru> just black
2017-08-30T20:18:08 <javjarfer> hahahahaha
2017-08-30T20:18:27 <javjarfer> I\'m laughing and hating it at same time
2017-08-30T20:19:48 <stegru> well, what do you expect?
2017-08-30T20:20:19 <stegru> if you set it to something that\'s not an image, the wall-paper will not be an image
2017-08-30T20:20:54 <stegru> i\'m just running wallpaper.ps1
2017-08-30T20:22:18 <javjarfer> but when you try to go back from setting that using the image that should work what do you get?
2017-08-30T20:22:31 <stegru> the image
2017-08-30T20:22:35 <javjarfer> after setting the folder?

b'2017-08-30T13:06:06 <Justin_o> probably my filtering needs to be updated
2017-08-30T13:06:13 <Justin_o> ah, that\'s true
2017-08-30T13:06:16 <Justin_o> because it went to both
2017-08-30T13:06:38 <Justin_o> that is, it was addressed to both
2017-08-30T13:07:26 <Bosmon> So what I was speculating was that cumbersome though it is, the renderer might still be worth the ASTEA team getting to grips with
2017-08-30T13:07:43 <Bosmon> Since it at least lets them share in the existing ecosystem of adjusters, as well as get their controls model-bound for free
2017-08-30T13:10:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry, still reading the e-mails. but what you are saying here makes sense
2017-08-30T13:11:23 <Bosmon> So I was hoping that you, I and cindyli could help them out to get over the initial steep learning slope : P

2017-08-30T13:12:00 <Bosmon> yuriy, georgitodorov, dandimitrov - I also wanted to introduce you to cindyli - Cindy Li who is also a member of Colin\'s team at the IDRC, and who is another core developer of the Infusion prefs framework
2017-08-30T13:12:14 <Bosmon> And as you see on Wednesdays, also a core GPII team member
2017-08-30T13:12:39 <cindyli> welcome, yuriy, georgitodorov, dandimitrov
2017-08-30T13:13:44 <georgitodorov> Hello, Cindy! Nice to meet you!
2017-08-30T13:16:43 * georgitodorov has quit

2017-08-30T14:01:56 <grrrero> Justin_o: Welcome back! I was able to get that last test to work (constrain panelIndex) and tests ran fine but for some reason I ran it again this morning and an error occurred (a different failure) not sure yet why
2017-08-30T14:06:09 <Justin_o> grrrero: interesting
2017-08-30T14:06:40 <Justin_o> grrrero: would you like to chat about it, and how things went the past few days?

2017-08-30T14:38:15 <Bosmon> Have you looked any further at the self-voicing and queueing/selection issues?
2017-08-30T14:39:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for checking in :) I haven\'t actually. The self-voicing work has been on the back burner while I work on bug fixes and integration work for UIO+ in preparation for the pilots. The click2speech extension will be used for the time being.
2017-08-30T14:40:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: from what I recall, I left the self-voicing queueing with a bit of an issue. The synchronization wasn\'t good. It seemed that it might be related to differences in how the synthesizer and ultimately my parsing dealt with whitespace
2017-08-30T14:40:56 <Justin_o> although it wasn\'t entirely clear.

2017-08-30T14:58:47 <Bosmon> Quite how bad was the sync?
2017-08-30T14:59:02 * danayo joined the channel

2017-08-30T15:01:33 <Bosmon> Maybe :)
2017-08-30T15:02:07 <Justin_o> :) tempered optimism

2017-08-30T15:22:15 <Bosmon> michelled - waiting on a PR review from cindyli
2017-08-30T15:23:33 <michelled> ah, ok, cindyli, are you aware of that?
2017-08-30T15:28:07 <cindyli> yes, on it right now, michelled and Bosmon

2017-08-30T16:30:57 <ussjoin> Question for all. How would people feel about doing chat via Slack, rather than IRC? Looking around in here, it seems like there are three issues that Slack might solve: 1) Lack of scrollback/unified context; 2) Ease of use (particularly for not-primarily-technical users); 3) Fear of Missing Out on conversations that happen while one is offline (or has a network blip). I don\'t know, however, if people have had Bad Experiences with
2017-08-30T16:30:57 <ussjoin> Slack, so I thought I\'d simply ask.
2017-08-30T16:31:39 <ussjoin> (There\'s also a fourth issue that\'s near to the issues I\'m working on---the ability to make definitive statements around "X user == X person"---but I think that\'s somewhat less critical for this specific area.)
2017-08-30T16:31:43 <michelled> it\'s not that people had bad experiences, it\'s that Slack was very accessible for a long time. I\'m not sure where they are now, though
2017-08-30T16:31:45 <michelled> do you know?
2017-08-30T16:31:57 <michelled> was *not* accessible
2017-08-30T16:33:16 <ussjoin> I know Slack has done a lot of work in that area; one issue I noticed is that they now have colorschemes that are designed for people with variable colorblindness, which was a significant boon to coworkers at previous clients. They\'re also a web page, which would make me *think* that they might be amenable to many web-based techniques. However, I am definitely, definitely not the accessibility expert in this room, so I\'ll defer to
2017-08-30T16:33:16 <ussjoin> the knowledge of others.
2017-08-30T16:34:35 <gtirloni> maybe one of our designers could evaluate it, since it\'s already being used for the SJRK
2017-08-30T16:37:38 <ussjoin> Would it be worthwhile to spin up an instance for GPII and have people simply try it for a period of time, then evaluate success/failure?
2017-08-30T16:37:58 <Justin_o> I have the mac app for connecting to the SJRK and other groups, but don\'t really use it much. In the app they do have keyboard support. I\'m not sure that the implementation is great or how complete it is, but they have explicitly added keyboard interactions. Also haven\'t tried it with a screen reader.
2017-08-30T16:38:06 <ussjoin> (Including the designers, nontechnical users... anyone.)
2017-08-30T16:38:24 <Justin_o> alanharnum: ^
2017-08-30T16:38:36 <Justin_o> do you have any thoughts on slack a11y?
2017-08-30T16:39:25 <alanharnum> we are using it experimentally on the SJRK project with the IRC bridge enabled as a fallback - it\'s not seeing too much usage, so hard to assess. We also don\'t have anyone involved in the project who is a screen reader user.
2017-08-30T16:39:37 <alanharnum> (not that that\'s the only form of accessibility that matters, obv)
2017-08-30T16:40:17 <alanharnum> there is a recent interview with George Zamfir on this: https://slackhq.com/designing-slack-for-everyone-456002920bf2
2017-08-30T16:40:26 <michelled> gmoss: not sure if we even told you about the slack channel: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit+-+Slack+Information
2017-08-30T16:40:32 <Justin_o> alanharnum: do we have a sense of what the limitations of the IRC bridge are?
2017-08-30T16:41:03 <gtirloni> Justin_o: we don\'t know who is on each side of the bridge... that\'s bad for discovery
2017-08-30T16:41:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah, so it\'s basically a bot that writes from one to the other
2017-08-30T16:41:44 <gtirloni> yep
2017-08-30T16:41:53 <gtirloni> it\'s not a deep integration
2017-08-30T16:41:56 <alanharnum> Justin_o: it seemed good at the basic task of letting you connect to the chat in realtime via IRC and get files that are shared while you\'re connected, but it obviously lacks many of the features that people value in Slack that ussjoin highlights
2017-08-30T16:42:14 <alanharnum> scrollback / context, threading of conversations, etc
2017-08-30T16:42:32 <Justin_o> how about logging with slack, i think there is a limitation for the free accounts
2017-08-30T16:42:58 <gmoss> michelled: thanks for the link!
2017-08-30T16:43:01 <gtirloni> it\'s interesting these folks elected Slack for their main chat space -- https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/07/anybody-can-be-an-a11y-slacker/
2017-08-30T16:43:34 <alanharnum> aside from a11y, I have some wariness about the use of Slack for projects like ours in terms of record retention, etc
2017-08-30T16:44:11 <alanharnum> i haven\'t looked at it recently but things like publicly accessible logs, exports of discussions, etc
2017-08-30T16:45:01 <alanharnum> it\'s easy to overstate concerns like that in regards to proprietary systems and the logical conclusion of that is the pathological / impossible "we must run all services ourselves, in our own datacentre", but it\'s one of the things on my mind when i think about Slack
2017-08-30T16:46:39 <alanharnum> Factoid: the Slack accessibility team is, I believe, essentially based around the corner from the IDRC
2017-08-30T16:46:40 <ussjoin> alanharnum: They have logs that are accessible to logged-in users. Exports are likewise available.
2017-08-30T16:47:00 <ussjoin> What\'s the wariness that you\'re concerned about?
2017-08-30T16:47:08 <Justin_o> gtirloni: so they seem to be using https://sameroom.io which may be the way to go i guess.. i think it was mentioned before, so not sure if it was explored or not
2017-08-30T16:47:25 <gtirloni> Justin_o: sameroom.io is very expensive
2017-08-30T16:47:27 <ussjoin> Justin_o: The limit on *accessibility* of Slack logs is 10k messages, which at our current rate would be months, not weeks.
2017-08-30T16:47:43 <ussjoin> And that\'s for unpaid accounts. Paid accounts are unlimited. But let\'s assume free for now.
2017-08-30T16:47:48 <Justin_o> gtirloni: well that\'s a problem
2017-08-30T16:48:11 <Justin_o> ussjoin: thanks, i think the intention though is to have our logs to be permanent
2017-08-30T16:48:11 <alanharnum> ussjoin: for me, the publicly accessible logs we get with our channels are an important feature - i\'d want the option to have logs of certain channels public. Slack may offer this, don\'t know current state.
2017-08-30T16:48:34 <ussjoin> We have a variety of different ways we could support that goal, Justin_o and alanharnum.
2017-08-30T16:48:35 <gtirloni> Justin_o: $49/month for anything more than 5 (FIVE!!) msg/day in the free plan
2017-08-30T16:48:44 <ussjoin> Including, say, adding a logging bot to relevant channels.
2017-08-30T16:48:57 <ussjoin> Slack\'s API is very powerful.
2017-08-30T16:49:02 <alanharnum> yup, that\'s a reasonable point
2017-08-30T16:49:08 <ussjoin> (And has a bajillion things already added to it.)
2017-08-30T16:49:14 <Justin_o> i wonder if botbot works with slack already
2017-08-30T16:49:15 <alanharnum> i used Slack integrations a lot in my previous job, and definitely appreciated them
2017-08-30T16:49:28 * avtar joined the channel
2017-08-30T16:49:41 <ussjoin> alanharnum: Yes---things like, say, CI failures are great to have in Slack.
2017-08-30T16:50:03 <Justin_o> gtirloni: 5 messages a day, that\'s not really a free plan i don\'t think. You\'d use that up in a second.
2017-08-30T16:50:23 <ussjoin> Yeah... let\'s assume not Sameroom. That seems a bit nuts.
2017-08-30T16:50:42 <gtirloni> I think for old-timers like me joining a project that uses IRC is like... meh, i\'m used to it. But a lot of people lately have no experience with it and expect "mobile first" (tm)(r) experience .. and irccloud is not a good alternative for that (constant disconnect, putting the trouble of paying for a permanent connection on users). This Slack discussion comes up every now and then but we always have concerns about proprietary platforms,
2017-08-30T16:50:42 <gtirloni> maybe we should have a FAQ for discussion optimization :)
2017-08-30T16:51:15 <ussjoin> Proprietary platforms---what\'s the actual concern? Perhaps that\'s something I can address.
2017-08-30T16:51:33 <ussjoin> We\'ve addressed logging and accessibility. What else?
2017-08-30T16:52:13 <alanharnum> I think any of the non-a11y / cost issues are probably overcomable with work; to my mind, it\'s then a question of how much work would be needed to get things with Slack that we currently get with IRC.
2017-08-30T16:52:25 <alanharnum> publicly available logs of certain channels, etc
2017-08-30T16:52:41 <gtirloni> ussjoin: I think there\'s are concerns about centralization/decentralization, big corporations, etc, but I\'m not equipped to speak about that, don\'t really have the knowledge to make a good assessment
2017-08-30T16:53:17 <alanharnum> a11y issues (not sure about their current status, information is hard to get / limited) are the biggest hard stop for me.
2017-08-30T16:54:17 <alanharnum> my main concern with proprietary is the potential loss of institutional memory / information captured in chat conversations, which can be mitigated with things like exports and logging
2017-08-30T16:54:52 <alanharnum> (note for ussjoin that my previous work was in the library field, so I am perhaps unusually attuned to this as a specific concern)
2017-08-30T16:55:57 <ussjoin> Again, though, if a11y is the issue, it sounds like there\'s already been a lot of work done addressing that issue. If there are remaining issues, can we have someone locate them and raise them with the Slack team?
2017-08-30T16:56:42 <gtirloni> mattermost is always an alternative, although last time I set it up it didn\'t get much traction because, since we were wary of moving off of IRC, it used a bridge and it made everything less magic
2017-08-30T16:57:25 <ussjoin> gtirloni: But that ends up with us having to host, support, and *defend* a solution. Whereas when we use Slack, we don\'t have to do any of those things.
2017-08-30T16:57:36 <gtirloni> agreed
2017-08-30T16:58:12 <alanharnum> ussjoin: they are definitely making progress, but without doing a full assessment (which is extremely time-consuming) or public information from Slack, it\'s hard to say where they are at
2017-08-30T16:59:22 <ussjoin> So that seems like an argument in favor of trying it.
2017-08-30T17:02:38 <gtirloni> because these channels are sharing between GPII and Fluid work, I don\'t know what are the next steps. If this was GPII-only, I\'d say starting a thread on the mailing list might be the way to go (and I think we have a wiki page with steps for suggesting new technologies)
2017-08-30T17:02:42 <gtirloni> s/sharing/shared
2017-08-30T17:03:45 <gtirloni> for me it\'d help if we had a definitive answer, I find these discussions too subjective (and I admit I was a bit frustrated with them in the past when I tried Slack, Mattermost, Gitter, etc). Maybe we should make it clear that the answer is no
2017-08-30T17:04:12 <ussjoin> The answer is no? I don\'t understand?
2017-08-30T17:04:43 <gtirloni> if the answer is no, make that clear
2017-08-30T17:04:46 <gtirloni> i think that\'s my point
2017-08-30T17:05:07 <alanharnum> assuming we had infinite labour, i think the biggest issue would be cost
2017-08-30T17:05:26 <ussjoin> Slack is free.
2017-08-30T17:05:34 <alanharnum> you really need to be paying for Standard if you want to leverage full potential
2017-08-30T17:05:41 <alanharnum> https://sojustrepairit.slack.com/pricing
2017-08-30T17:05:53 <ussjoin> That hasn\'t been true in my experience. What full potential are you referring to?
2017-08-30T17:07:40 <alanharnum> the main things for me, looking at their current list, is the logging retention and the integrations limit
2017-08-30T17:07:40 <gtirloni> http://slackarchive.io/
2017-08-30T17:07:52 <gtirloni> there\'s out botbot for slack
2017-08-30T17:07:57 <gtirloni> *our
2017-08-30T17:08:14 <alanharnum> I really liked the year and a half I used Slack at previous job
2017-08-30T17:08:36 <alanharnum> for the integrations in particular
2017-08-30T17:08:54 <ussjoin> alanharnum: 10 integrations isn\'t a low limit, though. IME at least.
2017-08-30T17:10:10 <alanharnum> ussjoin: I found I ran through them pretty quickly when I was an active Slack user, with a much smaller team that wasn\'t working in open source
2017-08-30T17:11:33 <alanharnum> all that said - i think the biggest part of this conversation whenever it comes up is the migration cost inherent in going from a current way of doing things to a new way that might be better, but has some unknowns in terms of migration cost and eventual outcome

2017-08-30T11:51:22 <stegru> :*
2017-08-30T11:52:28 <javjarfer> do you know which specific message is broadcast in Windows when a registry key is modified?
2017-08-30T11:52:51 <stegru> there isn\'t one
2017-08-30T11:53:34 <stegru> there\'s WM_SETTINGCHANGE, which asks applications to reload settings, but applications don\'t really respond to it
2017-08-30T11:53:53 <javjarfer> yes, I knew about that
2017-08-30T11:54:15 <stegru> are you trying to monitor a specific registry value?
2017-08-30T11:54:17 <javjarfer> but I have some XFiles behavior here regarding the wallpaper setting with SPI
2017-08-30T11:55:30 <javjarfer> not really, problem is that, when you try to set the wallpaper, but operation fails, then you got black background, because windows change the preference to solid color
2017-08-30T11:56:01 <javjarfer> oh, sorry, so it really broadcast WM_SETTINGCHANGE?
2017-08-30T11:56:04 <javjarfer> that is the one?
2017-08-30T11:56:40 <stegru> i think that\'s what is sent when a flag in fWinIni is set
2017-08-30T11:57:17 <stegru> yes, it is
2017-08-30T11:57:30 <Bosmon> Hey - afternoon there georgitodorov - welcome :)
2017-08-30T11:57:30 <stegru> but that wont help you, with the wallpaper failing
2017-08-30T11:57:36 <Bosmon> Just looking at your code samples now
2017-08-30T11:58:32 <javjarfer> yes, yes, until that point all is correct then I use that in fWinIni
2017-08-30T11:59:49 <javjarfer> problem is, you fail setting the wallpaper, then, you go back, using the same flags, and you still got the black screen
2017-08-30T12:00:29 <javjarfer> if you broadcast the WM_SETTINGCHANGE you will have, after a \'uncertain time\' a visible change in the wallpaper
2017-08-30T12:00:44 <stegru> ok
2017-08-30T12:01:09 <stegru> and you need to somehow check if it succeeded?
2017-08-30T12:01:31 <javjarfer> BUT if you set a random key in the registry, in ControlPanel->Desktop, then everything goes back normally
2017-08-30T12:01:56 <stegru> oh right
2017-08-30T12:02:00 <javjarfer> no need of second broadcast, probably because it does a second broadcast while explorer is reloading
2017-08-30T12:02:12 <stegru> hmm
2017-08-30T12:02:50 * amatas_ has quit
2017-08-30T12:02:52 <stegru> i wonder if you could set the wallpaper via the registry.. and somehow poke the desktop window into reacting to it
2017-08-30T12:05:21 <stegru> this is wierd: i went to C:\\Windows\\web\\wallpaper\\Flowers in explorer.. copied the path and it put C:\\Windows\\web\\wallpaper\\Theme2 in the clipboard
2017-08-30T12:06:44 <javjarfer> oh, nice, black magic
2017-08-30T12:07:43 * yuriy joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:08:23 <stegru> forget about changing the registry.. i set the WallPaper value, and nothing happened when i restarted explorer
2017-08-30T12:08:43 <javjarfer> hahaha totally expected weird behavior
2017-08-30T12:09:07 <stegru> i guess that value is there so control panel can show it
2017-08-30T12:10:10 <javjarfer> yes, you are probably right, well, problem is that nothing could be failing while setting because there is a fluid fail in that case, so, nothing is failing, but windows doesn\'t like that case
2017-08-30T12:10:23 <javjarfer> and in that case, you need a second broadcast
2017-08-30T12:10:35 <stegru> ok
2017-08-30T12:10:55 <javjarfer> to \'reset\', I think that registry hack could be valid... don\'t you think so?
2017-08-30T12:11:55 <stegru> well, i believe the wallpaper image is stored somewhere - you can delete the original wallpaper file, and nothing happens
2017-08-30T12:12:27 <javjarfer> okayyy wait a second
2017-08-30T12:12:30 <georgitodorov> Hi, Bosmon. Nice to meet you! Thank you for taking time to look at the code. Let me know if you have any questions or if I can help you with anything.
2017-08-30T12:12:39 <javjarfer> it changes! problem is that there is a terrible delay
2017-08-30T12:13:00 <javjarfer> and you need to do things with the desktop...
2017-08-30T12:13:35 <stegru> yeh, i just rebooted
2017-08-30T12:13:36 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:14:03 <javjarfer> xD why?
2017-08-30T12:14:21 <stegru> to see if it that made it reload the wallpaper
2017-08-30T12:14:36 * dandimitrov joined the channel

2017-08-30T12:15:22 <Bosmon> Oh hey - welcome dandimitrov also :)
2017-08-30T12:15:28 <javjarfer> okay okay... yes, it\'s really weird behavior, sometimes does, sometimes no, sometimes takes more, sometimes take less
2017-08-30T12:15:35 <dandimitrov> Hi everyone :)
2017-08-30T12:15:41 <javjarfer> for sure is something related with internal caching
2017-08-30T12:15:46 <javjarfer> dandimitrov, hi!
2017-08-30T12:15:50 <stegru> hi dandimitrov
2017-08-30T12:16:03 * yuriy joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:16:18 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - at least everyone who is here so far, I want to introduce you yuriy, georgitodorov and dandimitrov who are the ASTEA team working on the PCP
2017-08-30T12:16:31 <javjarfer> well, if it\'s something related with that, and seen that there is no actual API for setting solid colors for desktop wallpaper and we are in the limit of undocumented API
2017-08-30T12:16:33 <Bosmon> I\'ll be able to introduce you to a few more people in an hour or so as the Toronto work day starts
2017-08-30T12:16:35 <javjarfer> I will go with the hack
2017-08-30T12:17:36 <javjarfer> hi yuriy, georgitodorov, dandimitrov nice to meet you JJ here, I don\'t know if we have talked before
2017-08-30T12:19:26 <yuriy> hi, JJ, nice to meet you, too
2017-08-30T12:21:10 <dandimitrov> Nice to meet you JJ :)
2017-08-30T12:22:08 <stegru> hi astea guys
2017-08-30T12:22:28 * Caren joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:22:34 <stegru> javjarfer: i think this is where it\'s stored.. C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Themes
2017-08-30T12:23:37 <stegru> there\'s a file "TranscodedWallpaper".. this is the image after it\'s been adjusted, i guess
2017-08-30T12:24:17 <javjarfer> stegru, interesting, how could something so simple hide in that way xD
2017-08-30T12:24:40 <javjarfer> well, more resources if we want to track in the future where that comes
2017-08-30T12:25:06 <stegru> well, maybe that could be used to restore the wallpaper
2017-08-30T12:25:52 <stegru> or check if the change had worked.. if the setting failed, then would that file exist?
2017-08-30T12:26:26 <javjarfer> I guess not, because in that case it actually needs the file..
2017-08-30T12:26:39 <javjarfer> okay, I\'m going to look at it
2017-08-30T12:27:50 <stegru> well, that file is created by SystemPArametersInfo.. according to the stack in procmon
2017-08-30T12:29:31 * Caren joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:30:18 * alanharnum joined the channel

2017-08-30T12:32:53 * Caren has quit
2017-08-30T12:43:19 <javjarfer> the new file is created by SystemParametersInfo? But if you fail to set the route to the original file, it\'s impossible to make anything with that
2017-08-30T12:43:58 * koo5 joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:57:29 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I wanted to introduce you to the Astea PCP team who are yuriy, georgitodorov and dandimitrov
2017-08-30T12:57:52 <Bosmon> They recently forwarded one of their rendering questions to fluid-work and I gave it a quick answer
2017-08-30T12:58:26 <Bosmon> We are thinking about what approach might be appropriate for them to render their UI, and what assistance the prefs framework and its existing system for "adjusters" might give them
2017-08-30T12:58:55 <Justin_o> yuriy, georgitodorov and dandimitrov: hello and welcome
2017-08-30T12:59:23 <yuriy> hello Justin, nice to meet you
2017-08-30T12:59:26 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-08-30T12:59:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: when was the e-mail sent to fluid-work. I don\'t seem to see it
2017-08-30T12:59:39 <Justin_o> or what was it called, maybe i\'m just missing it
2017-08-30T13:00:01 <Justin_o> yuriy: nice to meet you too.. i think I\'ve heard you on the architecture meetings
2017-08-30T13:00:08 <yuriy> "Infusion questions" from yesterday
2017-08-30T13:00:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yesterday morning
2017-08-30T13:00:30 <Bosmon> My reply was just sent a couple of minutes ago
2017-08-30T13:02:58 <Bosmon> Somehow the address doesn\'t look quite right
2017-08-30T13:03:10 <Bosmon> Perhaps I received it only because it got sent to the GPII architecture list as well
2017-08-30T13:03:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i see it in my filter for the GPII list
2017-08-30T13:03:40 <Bosmon> The list address was set as fluid-work@lists.idrc.ocad.ca - is this going to work?
2017-08-30T13:03:49 * jhung joined the channel
2017-08-30T13:03:52 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-08-30T13:04:07 <Bosmon> I sent my reply there and got it back
2017-08-30T13:04:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: your reply bounced back?
2017-08-30T13:04:45 <Justin_o> or it went through
2017-08-30T13:05:05 <Justin_o> it looks like it should work, although i send my e-mails to fluid-work to a different address
2017-08-30T13:05:16 <Bosmon> I believe it went through, in that I seemed to receive it in the normal way
2017-08-30T13:05:21 <Bosmon> Did you see it?
2017-08-30T13:05:28 <Justin_o> the address mentioned at the bottom of the fluid-work e-mails is the one you mentioned
2017-08-30T13:05:45 <Bosmon> Yes
2017-08-30T13:05:51 <Bosmon> I see both the emails in the online archive
2017-08-30T13:05:52 <Justin_o> i\'ll take a look at it there
2017-08-30T13:06:01 <Justin_o> okay, great.. so looks like it\'s okay
2017-08-30T13:06:04 <Bosmon> So perhaps your filter just picked it out of the GPII arch list first
