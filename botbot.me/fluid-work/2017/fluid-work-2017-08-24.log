2017-08-24T15:50:34 <Bosmon> michelled, cindyli - I am on the trail of your test problems
2017-08-24T15:51:00 <michelled> what have you found?
2017-08-24T15:51:07 <Bosmon> Well I have found quite a number of things
2017-08-24T15:51:14 <Bosmon> The situation is really rather complicated
2017-08-24T15:51:48 <Bosmon> Firstly i) the console.write callback in node-jqunit is indeed the cause of the failure to detect 0 fixtures queued -> error at the OS
2017-08-24T15:53:28 <Bosmon> ii) The corresponding qUnit.onAllTestsDone.addListener in your tests.js needs to be removed
2017-08-24T15:53:47 <Bosmon> iii) You have caused some problems by using a mismatched version of node-jqunit in your app to the one used by the rest of the system
2017-08-24T15:54:01 <Bosmon> iv) Unfortunately, bringing these versions into line exposes some yet further horrific problem
2017-08-24T15:54:23 <Bosmon> That I think I have eventually tracked down to there somehow being two different QUnit object instances in the system, even though there is only one library
2017-08-24T15:55:15 <Bosmon> My suspicion is that this is being caused by there being more than one call, in the end, to fluid.loadTestingSupport
2017-08-24T15:55:25 <Bosmon> I\'m now going to test this idea
2017-08-24T15:55:54 <Bosmon> I assigned random ids to each QUnit instance and here is the current trace I am looking at:
2017-08-24T15:55:59 <Bosmon> QUnit id pmevzzxc0gmowq3kgldi config.current [object Object]
2017-08-24T15:55:59 <Bosmon> Now executing testFunc for gpii.tests.acceptance.cloudBased.config.base tests config.current is undefined
2017-08-24T15:55:59 <Bosmon> QUnit id 417hj4ih7rav9hir7ldi config.current undefined
2017-08-24T15:55:59 <Bosmon> 08:50:15.173:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.acceptance.cloudBased.config.base tests" Test name "Acceptance test for empty preferences in Chrome" - Message: Died on test #1     at Object.asyncTest (C:\\gpii-app\
ode_modules\\infusion\\tests\\lib\\qunit\\js\\qunit.js:411:9)
2017-08-24T15:56:10 <Bosmon> One of the QUnits believes it is in the middle of a test, and the other one doesn\'t
2017-08-24T16:00:01 <Bosmon> YAY YAY YAY tests are running
2017-08-24T16:00:09 <michelled> :D
2017-08-24T16:00:32 <Bosmon> OK, so this requires me to make updates to both node-jqUnit as well as Infusion itself
2017-08-24T16:00:45 <Bosmon> Which I unfortunately can\'t do now because we now have a Windows meeting and then I am going .... OUTT
2017-08-24T16:01:00 <Bosmon> But hopefully you and cindyli have something else to crack on with in the meantime
2017-08-24T16:01:10 <michelled> for sure - you know how it is :)
2017-08-24T16:01:18 <michelled> thanks so much for your help Bosmon!
2017-08-24T16:01:20 <Bosmon> Yes, it\'s insane
2017-08-24T16:01:27 <Bosmon> I should have been spending this time fixing the PCP API
2017-08-24T16:01:47 <Bosmon> But I noticed that kasparnet is AWOL and without him I can\'t do anything practical anyway
2017-08-24T16:02:01 * cindyli has quit
2017-08-24T16:02:18 <Bosmon> Actually I inserted the duplicate call to fluid.loadTestingSupport into your AppTests.js myself
2017-08-24T16:02:38 <Bosmon> Since I noticed it was incapable of running its own tests as a standalone file without it

2017-08-24T16:08:39 <gtirloni> oh
2017-08-24T16:09:42 <gtirloni> Bosmon: thanks for investigating that. the most i could do yesterday was to look for signs of life from the OS side but i exhausted my knowledge of node.js at that point :)
