2017-01-23T14:52:40 <colinclark> I did, yes
2017-01-23T14:52:59 <colinclark> Could we consider something even simpler?
2017-01-23T14:53:18 <colinclark> Such as a file containing deprecated APIs in the repository?
2017-01-23T14:53:22 <colinclark> and a post to the mailing list about it

2017-01-23T17:06:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: sorry about the delay in replying
2017-01-23T17:06:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: so in your suggestion we potentially wouldn\'t have a release between deprecating and removing
2017-01-23T17:06:54 <colinclark> yep
2017-01-23T17:07:00 <colinclark> no release, but plenty of notification
2017-01-23T17:09:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: what would constitute plenty of notification? So for example let\'s say we want to release in December. If we remove something today, i think that would be plenty of notice. But what would the cut off be if we find something else we want to remove?
2017-01-23T17:09:33 <colinclark> I think that\'s something we need not formalized
2017-01-23T17:09:35 <colinclark> formalize
2017-01-23T17:10:05 <colinclark> I don\'t think we need a rule for everything; we just need to be fair and open about the decisions we make
2017-01-23T17:11:34 <colinclark> As you\'ve noted, we haven\'t yet announced 2.0
2017-01-23T17:11:43 <colinclark> so I think it\'s reasonable to say that our deprecations are coming at the time of 2.0
2017-01-23T17:11:55 <colinclark> and in the next major release we can review if it\'s been long enough to fairly remove them
2017-01-23T17:12:00 <colinclark> or if we should hold off a little longer
2017-01-23T17:12:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s an interesting point.. it\'s not in the code or release notes though, but i suppose we could add it to the docs or something
2017-01-23T17:12:34 <colinclark> That\'s where people tend to notice these things anyway
2017-01-23T17:12:58 <Justin_o> colinclark: right, could you propose that on the list
2017-01-23T17:13:05 <colinclark> sure
2017-01-23T17:13:13 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-01-23T17:17:54 <Justin_o> colinclark, simonjb: did you have a chance to look into CLAs and Copyrights
2017-01-23T17:18:11 <colinclark> not yet, Justin_o

2017-01-23T22:50:06 <colinclark> don\'t let it distract you, but just in case you were curious
2017-01-23T22:52:42 <colinclark> I imagine I\'m very close to outgrowing the wiki format and will need a Git repo instead for these examples
