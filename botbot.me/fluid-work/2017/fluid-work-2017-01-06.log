b"2017-01-06T20:13:33 <colinclark> What kind of guidance do you feel you need?
2017-01-06T20:16:06 <colinclark> There are some documentation and resources for getting involved in our wiki that may be helpful: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved
2017-01-06T20:16:28 <Khushil_> I just want to start with beginner's bug..With that, I also want to understand source code..So that I can work with that and understand it better..
2017-01-06T20:16:37 <colinclark> And then perhaps you'll want to familiarize yourself with Infusion by building a small application with it, based on whatever you're most interested and motivated by
2017-01-06T20:17:05 <colinclark> I'm not sure anyone can give you a recipe for open source, but there are lots of helpful starting points in our wiki, the Infusion documentation and our JIRA
2017-01-06T20:17:25 <colinclark> and then you'll want to find the things that interest you about our work, and start to explore it a bit further
2017-01-06T20:18:28 <colinclark> If you're looking for a primer on open source in general, this book is an old one but was helpful when I was getting started: http://producingoss.com/
2017-01-06T20:18:43 <colinclark> and there are probably others that are newer that you can find, which may be helpful in terms of starting the engagement

2017-01-06T20:20:15 <Khushil_> Yeah..Thanks..!! I will start explore all these things..Can I ask doubts or any query here ?
2017-01-06T20:20:34 <colinclark> Sure, if you have questions you can ask them here
2017-01-06T20:21:14 <Khushil_> Thanks..All these things will be very helpful..
2017-01-06T20:21:43 <colinclark> Good luck!

2017-01-06T16:33:34 <kavya> Hi Everyone
2017-01-06T16:33:58 <kavya> I have done automating login/logout demopersonas via URL
2017-01-06T16:34:34 <kavya> now i want to automate demopersonas like sammy,elod,alice login/logout via USB and RFID
2017-01-06T16:35:07 <kavya> for this i think i need to simulate usb and send user tokens
2017-01-06T16:35:58 <kavya> How can i acheive this? Does any one have any leads on how to work on this usecase?
2017-01-06T16:37:41 <kavya> I am using python for scripting..
2017-01-06T16:39:46 <kavya> colinclark:gloob_:jhernandez: Any ideas
2017-01-06T16:49:35 <colinclark> alanharnum: I\'m just going to hop on the subway and we can chat about the ILDH entry when I get there?
2017-01-06T16:50:34 <colinclark> kavya: I guess you\'d need to look at something like scripting VirtualBox with a disk image that you attach as a drive to it?
2017-01-06T16:50:51 <colinclark> Otherwise I can imagine you\'ll need to look at mocking that part of the interaction
2017-01-06T16:51:39 <colinclark> Perhaps by somehow "recording" the messages sent from a real USB or RFID listeners and then replaying those via your mocks
2017-01-06T16:54:00 <kavya> ok..i did not know about these approaches.
2017-01-06T16:54:20 <kavya> will try and see if i can do through mocking
2017-01-06T16:54:49 <kavya> thanks colin..
2017-01-06T16:56:28 <colinclark> it\'s not really ideal, of course
2017-01-06T16:56:31 <colinclark> but maybe it would work
2017-01-06T16:56:36 <colinclark> I\'m trying to think of other optoins
2017-01-06T16:57:10 <colinclark> perhaps you can find some kind of thing that you can run from your python script to mount ISO images as if they were real USB disks
2017-01-06T16:57:18 <colinclark> but the RFID reader will be much harder in that regard

2017-01-06T19:07:12 <alanharnum> Hi Bosmon - saw the FLUID-6103 JIRA you just opened. Do you experience the issue at http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/component-tests/textToSpeech/html/TextToSpeech-test.html?
2017-01-06T19:07:34 <alanharnum> (testing from my various systems for replication, starting there)
2017-01-06T19:08:38 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes, I do
2017-01-06T19:09:17 <alanharnum> Bosmon: OK, thanks - it doesn\'t replicate for me in Chrome 55.0.2883.95 on OS X, testing in Chrome on Windows 10 now
2017-01-06T19:10:32 <alanharnum> appears to be Windows-only (extra-fun to figure out what\'s going on...)
2017-01-06T19:10:43 <Bosmon> alanharnum - well, brilliant that you can reproduce it at all
2017-01-06T19:10:51 <Bosmon> I imagine there is a BROWSER BUG
2017-01-06T19:11:05 <Bosmon> Which we may or may not have to work around for one or more Chrome release cycles
2017-01-06T19:11:21 <alanharnum> yes, I wonder if the different versions are responsible - 2883.95 is latest on OS X, 2883.87 is latest on Windows

2017-01-06T19:34:40 <colinclark> since I know Bosmon is at dinner
2017-01-06T19:35:01 <colinclark> Can you point me to documentation on how a user can restore their settings using the journaller in the case of a failure of the GPII, kavya?
2017-01-06T19:35:22 <michelled> that looks promising colinclark, thx!
2017-01-06T19:35:50 <colinclark> And also can you point me to any bugs you\'ve found in this restore process, kavya?

2017-01-06T19:47:48 <kavya> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2160 i reported this issue...this can be reproduced now using vladimir
2017-01-06T19:48:59 <kavya> logging out of vladimir dp throws error and leave preference settings(high contrast)https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2145
2017-01-06T19:49:55 <kavya> journaling in this case did not restore the system
2017-01-06T20:00:06 <colinclark> do you know which part of vladmir\'s preference set causes the issue, kavya?
2017-01-06T20:00:10 <colinclark> JAWS or something?
2017-01-06T20:03:14 <kavya> it is high contrast
