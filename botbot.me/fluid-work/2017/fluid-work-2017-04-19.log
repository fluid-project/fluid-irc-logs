2017-04-19T15:55:09 <kasparnet> Bosmon (or anyone else): Do you know if fluid.tabbable has changed recently
2017-04-19T15:55:19 <kasparnet> I\'m getting an error in the privacy tests "Unable to look up name fluid.tabbable as a global function"

2017-04-19T15:57:00 <Bosmon> Has it not been included somehow or gone missing?

2017-04-19T15:58:48 <Bosmon> cindyli, the-t-in-rtf - we need to do something about the truly enormous timeouts for "{gpii.tests.dbDataStore.environment}.events.onCleanupComplete" in trunk
2017-04-19T15:59:05 <kasparnet> Bosmon: not sure -- I\'ll do a bit of digging
2017-04-19T15:59:06 <kasparnet> thanks
2017-04-19T15:59:48 <Bosmon> It currently takes about half an hour to run the universal test cases on my machine
2017-04-19T16:01:08 <cindyli> checking fluid.tabbable
2017-04-19T16:02:45 <the-t-in-rtf> On my way to the meeting, goToMeeting is not being cooperative.
2017-04-19T16:03:46 <cindyli> kasparnet: fluid.tabbable has not changed recently. i sort of rmb i hit the similar error when having different versions of infusion pulled in by node dependencies

2017-04-19T16:11:21 <kasparnet> ah, that might be it

2017-04-19T16:36:25 <the-t-in-rtf> In a careful review of gpii-pouchdb, none of the calls to rimraf in the pouchdb cleanup support a hard timeout.  I will write up a ticket with the various options for further comment.
2017-04-19T16:45:36 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, @Bosmon https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2392
2017-04-19T16:47:12 <cindyli> thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2017-04-19T16:51:49 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - can you explain why the cleanup appears to stall for, say, 15 seconds?
2017-04-19T16:54:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I have no explanation at the moment, the only timeout and retry mechanism they have is for "busy" conditions.
2017-04-19T16:54:59 <the-t-in-rtf> and that should consume on the order of 500ms even if it was firing.
2017-04-19T16:55:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect some other kind of "busyness" that is eventually successful.
2017-04-19T16:55:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Are there any warnings to the console that might shed any light?
2017-04-19T16:57:37 <Bosmon> the - https://pastebin.com/2AMqQBQr
2017-04-19T16:57:39 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf
2017-04-19T16:57:41 <Bosmon> This is what there is
2017-04-19T16:58:20 <the-t-in-rtf> the third option proposed in the ticket may help with this.
2017-04-19T16:58:33 <Bosmon> Consistently, a gap of > 10 seconds between attempting to shut down, and a notification of "onCleanupComplete" presumably triggered by finally getting this ERROR
2017-04-19T16:59:10 <the-t-in-rtf> can you quickly paste an example of a single test that does this so I don\'t have to run everything?
2017-04-19T16:59:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, for my reference, I\'m assuming this is on bare iron and not in Vagrant?
2017-04-19T16:59:36 <Bosmon> Yes, bare iron
2017-04-19T16:59:57 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, we\'ll have a longer row to hoe if I can\'t reproduce in Vagrant, but we can start there.
2017-04-19T17:01:28 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - it seems harder to reproduce this when running the tests in isolation
2017-04-19T17:01:45 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I can certainly try it in the background.
2017-04-19T17:01:46 <Bosmon> I just tried executing the tests which were presumably active when I got that error
2017-04-19T17:02:00 <Bosmon> That is,  node gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/test/pouchManagerTests.js
2017-04-19T17:02:01 <the-t-in-rtf> (running the full suite, I mean)
2017-04-19T17:02:07 <Bosmon> And it concluded in an orderly way without delay
2017-04-19T17:02:26 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2017-04-19T17:02:30 <Bosmon> So I guess this is triggered by this special logic we have for "enlatening" pouch startup if some pouch cleanup is already in progress
2017-04-19T17:02:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Do we even still have this?
2017-04-19T17:02:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I thought that was gone.
2017-04-19T17:02:55 <Bosmon> I\'d imagine I could reproduce it consistently by just trying to run TWO pouch-requesting tests back to back
2017-04-19T17:03:03 <Bosmon> Ah, I guess it is just in my mind
2017-04-19T17:03:15 <Bosmon> But still, the underlying phenomenon causing it will be the same :)
2017-04-19T17:03:24 * cindyli has quit
2017-04-19T17:03:32 <Bosmon> Let me find the first delay in my logs
2017-04-19T17:04:00 <Bosmon> It\'s this one: 16:40:24.552:  Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 8 of 10 sequence element {
2017-04-19T17:04:00 <Bosmon> "event": "{testCaseHolder}.events.onCleanupComplete",
2017-04-19T17:04:00 <Bosmon> "listener": "fluid.identity"
2017-04-19T17:04:00 <Bosmon> } of fixture Acceptance test for background color change in Chrome - Access secured settings with false token
2017-04-19T17:04:30 <Bosmon> Which occurs 30 seconds into the test run
2017-04-19T17:04:40 <Bosmon> Which suggests that until that point, everything is running pretty well
2017-04-19T17:04:44 <Bosmon> After that point, it all runs into the mire
2017-04-19T17:05:31 <Bosmon> After that, every test will delay by what looks like pretty consistently just under 13 seconds
