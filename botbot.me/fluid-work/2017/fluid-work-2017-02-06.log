2017-02-06T14:52:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: have a minute to talk about model transfomrations
2017-02-06T14:52:08 <Justin_o> ?
2017-02-06T14:52:14 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2017-02-06T14:52:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. so i\'m working on the textfield stepper.. which will be like the textfield slider, except that instead of having a slider it will have increment and decrement buttons.
2017-02-06T14:53:09 <Justin_o> I want to disable these buttons at the min and max resepectively
2017-02-06T14:53:16 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-02-06T14:53:21 <Justin_o> i want to use model transformations for that
2017-02-06T14:53:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2017-02-06T14:53:28 <Bosmon> There is already a precedent for doing this
2017-02-06T14:53:31 <Bosmon> In the Pager code
2017-02-06T14:53:38 <Justin_o> oh cool
2017-02-06T14:53:41 <Justin_o> let me look at that
2017-02-06T14:53:58 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-02-06T14:55:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I thought there was, but there isn\'t :)
2017-02-06T14:55:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay, that\'s why i can\'t find it ;)
2017-02-06T14:55:31 <Bosmon> I know there is one though, in some of cindyli\'s work
2017-02-06T14:56:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was looking at the quantize and inRange transforms, which are close, but not perfect
2017-02-06T14:56:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have an example of transforming a bound to a boolean?
2017-02-06T14:57:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - at a pinch, you can just use the === binary operator: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#binary-operation-fluid-transforms-binaryop-
2017-02-06T14:57:46 <Bosmon> Although it\'s a bit verbose until we support expressions in model transforms
2017-02-06T14:58:09 <Bosmon> I don\'t think anyone would blame you if you just did what the Pager actually does :)

2017-02-06T15:00:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in that case, would it be preferable to do a free transform or use a modelListener to change the model value
2017-02-06T15:01:02 <Justin_o> i have the buttons as separate components, with a model value holding their disabled state
2017-02-06T15:01:05 <Bosmon> Ah ok
2017-02-06T15:01:12 <Bosmon> Well ok, you can use the binop then
2017-02-06T15:03:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, yes that looks good

2017-02-06T16:33:25 <cindyli> Bosmon, gtirloni, simonjb, stegru: I made some changes to the security wiki - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Continued_Researches_on_Possible_Approaches_for_Protecting_Communication_btw_LFM_and_CBFM#A_dedicated_process.2Fservice_running_on_a_different_account_for_storing_the_GPII_client_secret, can you have a look and let me know if there are things unclear to you before I send it to the gpii list? Thanks.
2017-02-06T16:34:57 <stegru> I wish there was a way to view changes
2017-02-06T16:35:46 <stegru> oh! cindyli, on the weekend I had an epiphany about this
2017-02-06T16:35:50 <Bosmon> Cheers cindyli - I like the increased attribution on this page :)
2017-02-06T16:37:35 <Bosmon> "5. The windows service spawns the GPII local flow manager from a fixed pre-known path as its child process." perhaps this point is somewhat unclear
2017-02-06T16:37:45 <Bosmon> What will a "fixed pre-known" path achieve?
2017-02-06T16:38:34 <stegru> well,
2017-02-06T16:40:30 <stegru> the service has to start a new instance of gpii, this should be a fixed path (set during install) rather than one specified on the fly by the user-launched gpii process
2017-02-06T16:41:44 <Bosmon> Is it important whether the user has write access to that path?
2017-02-06T16:42:29 <stegru> yes, it shouldn\'t... this will be the process that the service trusts
2017-02-06T16:43:11 <stegru> i mean: yes it\'s important.. the user shouldn\'t have write access
2017-02-06T16:44:02 <stegru> if the user can write to it, then they can change the way the app behaves, and make the service perform undesirable requests
2017-02-06T16:47:20 <stegru> cindyli: in the secret signing part, the algorithm should be: hmac_sha256("secret", "challenge"). "HMAC" does a bit more than hash the secret+challenge, and this is what it\'s designed for
2017-02-06T16:47:47 <stegru> (that came to my head while tidying the garden)
2017-02-06T16:47:50 <Bosmon> stegru - got a link for that? :)
2017-02-06T16:47:58 <stegru> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code
2017-02-06T16:48:23 <stegru> https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createhmac_algorithm_key
2017-02-06T16:48:31 <Bosmon> great
2017-02-06T16:48:40 * sirdancealot has quit
2017-02-06T16:51:57 <stegru> there is a slight weakness in the whole "client id" thing, because it uses a shared secret - the secret has to be passed from the server to the client at some time.
2017-02-06T16:53:01 <stegru> this is done at installation, i\'m not sure how this can be intercepted, but the risk is there
2017-02-06T17:09:52 <cindyli> thanks, stegru, i will update the wiki with hmac_sha256(). can you elaborate on the risk of passing the client secret from the server to client at the installation?
2017-02-06T17:11:51 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-02-06T17:12:38 <stegru> cindyli: during the registration, it might be intercepted
2017-02-06T17:13:19 <stegru> but, https will be used so it will be ok
2017-02-06T17:13:23 <cindyli> stegru: if someone was poking over the installer\'s shoulder when the secret is given?
2017-02-06T17:14:52 <cindyli> stegru: https? maybe i didn\'t make it clear on the wiki. the id/secret will be given to the installer person on the GPII site. this person then copies and pastes it at installation
2017-02-06T17:15:04 <cindyli> there\'s no http requests involve in this process
2017-02-06T17:15:35 <cindyli> the installer can always come back to the gpii site to revoke this client id/secret
2017-02-06T17:16:52 <cindyli> but re-viewing the secret will need more verification, the secret by default would be shown like password
2017-02-06T17:20:17 <stegru> yes, there is a http request - the website
2017-02-06T17:23:54 <cindyli> right :)
