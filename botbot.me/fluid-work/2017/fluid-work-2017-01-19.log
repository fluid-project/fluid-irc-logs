b'2017-01-19T22:51:28 <Bosmon> Given this message might hang around for years in some cases, I wonder if we might take the opportunity to amend it
2017-01-19T22:51:45 <Bosmon> Since this will be a time horizon that might be visible in the commit of every file in the repo....

2017-01-19T14:30:07 <Justin_o> also thoughts on this JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6104
2017-01-19T14:30:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, sure
2017-01-19T14:30:46 <Bosmon> I have no particular interest in FLUID-6104 : P
2017-01-19T14:31:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: meaning interest in it being addressed or in reading it?
2017-01-19T14:31:55 <Justin_o> i left a comment there, i\'m not actually sure it should be addressed anymore, but was wondering your opinion on that actually.. i could just close it, or drop the priority
2017-01-19T14:32:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2017-01-19T14:33:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, i\'m going to deprecate the tow dev releases that are marked as 2.0.0 but came after tagging Infusion 2.0

2017-01-19T15:48:08 <jhernandez> are you enough inspired already?
2017-01-19T15:48:37 <stegru> yes, it inspired me not to bother! I\'ve found a better way of doing what I was trying
2017-01-19T15:53:25 <jhernandez> cool
2017-01-19T15:58:26 <Justin_o> jhung: if you pull down my branch for the fluid site, you can see some messy CSS that gets the showcase item aligned.. just for the Learner Options for now though
2017-01-19T15:59:26 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey, I\'m wondering whether you remember this pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/407
2017-01-19T15:59:27 <Justin_o> jhung: if you have time to let me know what you think of the idea so far, that\'d be great.. we\'ll need to  clean up the css though as we\'re probably overriding things that could be removed later. also one side effect is that when you increase text size the showcase now increases as well
2017-01-19T16:07:44 <jhung> Justin_o: ok, I\'ll take a look.

2017-01-19T21:00:49 <gloob> stegru: que?
2017-01-19T21:01:10 <stegru> what did you want?
2017-01-19T21:01:27 <gloob> stegru: I wanted to ask you if you had opportunity to test the bypass with a non privileged account?
2017-01-19T21:01:33 <gloob> stegru: I haven\'t
2017-01-19T21:02:02 <gloob> stegru: wanted to check if it\'s a solution
2017-01-19T21:02:07 <stegru> i don\'t know what you mean
2017-01-19T21:02:11 <gloob> stegru: and also to say that I\'m not a powershell fan
2017-01-19T21:02:18 <gloob> I\'m *not*
2017-01-19T21:02:23 <stegru> oh, that
2017-01-19T21:02:31 <gloob> in fact, I don\'t like so much
2017-01-19T21:02:36 <gloob> like it*
2017-01-19T21:02:43 <stegru> no, me neither
2017-01-19T21:03:33 <gloob> stegru: ok, I will try by myself, it seems a good solution anyhow
2017-01-19T21:04:26 <gloob> I don\'t like powershell but I like less windows batch scripting
2017-01-19T21:05:00 <gloob> at least with ps1 you have access to the .net framework, the only plus I guess
2017-01-19T21:05:13 <stegru> yes, that means you can do almost anything with it
2017-01-19T21:05:29 <stegru> it\'s really powerful, but the language is crap
2017-01-19T21:05:36 <gloob> stegru: absolutely
2017-01-19T21:06:04 <gloob> stegru: so thank you for your time, it was just that
2017-01-19T21:06:13 <stegru> oh ok

2017-01-19T22:14:50 <alanharnum> Khushil: if you don\'t know of it RawGit is a really useful service to show off static projects you have on GitHub - it works for your app https://rawgit.com/KhushilMistry/Experiment_with_Infusion/master/demos/inlineEdit/WeightConverter/weightConverter.html
2017-01-19T22:19:06 <Khushil> Ohh Thanks..I did\'t know this !! Now I am thinking to explore a bit..!! I want to add some more features..!! I also want to explore beginners bug so that I can understand source code deeply..!! Should I start exploring beginners bug or add some more features to it ??
2017-01-19T22:22:32 <alanharnum> Khushil: I think it would be worth looking at the beginner\'s bugs, since you\'ve spent some time exploring Infusion - you might have a sense if you can try to tackle some of them from that.
2017-01-19T22:25:20 <Khushil> Cool..So I will start exploring beginner\'s bug and also try to add some more features of Infusion to my app..!! I can pick any beginner\'s bug from JIRA or some specific ones ??

2017-01-19T22:30:39 <Khushil> Thanks..I will try to do both things simultaneously..!!
