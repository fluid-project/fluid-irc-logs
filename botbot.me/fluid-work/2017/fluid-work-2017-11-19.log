2017-11-19T18:02:19 <chlorophilia> hi bosmon \xe2\x80\x94as mentioned this document is a little out of date and my workflow has changed since adding in additional columns, but this still represents the fundamentals

2017-11-19T18:05:25 <chlorophilia> the document also refers to a work flow I haven\xe2\x80\x99t kept up during 2017: updating a spreadsheet of project stats

2017-11-19T18:06:19 <chlorophilia> these stats are a great reference point in assessing the progress of the project, in the way of community engagement as well as species reported
2017-11-19T18:07:10 <chlorophilia> last year I kept it up on a monthly basis (which was actually quite motivating for me, to keep those numbers up!); since then, however, because of how time consuming it proved to be, I decided I might try and do it annually.
2017-11-19T18:08:17 <chlorophilia> scripting the process of updating these stats might be more helpful than scripting the curation of the species list, in view of some of the ways in which the latter activity benefits me as the curator and helps me ensure quality control over the data
