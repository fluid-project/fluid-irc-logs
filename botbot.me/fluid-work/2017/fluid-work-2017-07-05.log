2017-07-05T19:56:35 <gtirloni_> yep, it's pretty easy to see what's going on. we've had it for a month or so, but i was figuring out how to organize it better (and getting a feeling of how reliable it was)

2017-07-05T20:25:42 <Caren> let me know when you have time?

2017-07-05T17:38:08 <gtirloni> do you know how to make it go away?
2017-07-05T17:39:33 <michelled> is that the multiple infusion issue?
2017-07-05T17:40:46 <Justin_o> gtirloni: not sure how you\'re sourcing infusion, but maybe jQuery or jQuery UI is missing.. i\'m not sure though. Could be related to what michelle mentioned above
2017-07-05T17:43:03 <gtirloni> I\'m getting this error when testing universal

2017-07-05T17:54:11 <gtirloni> looks like third time\'s a charm
2017-07-05T17:54:28 <gtirloni> https://ci.gpii.net/blue/organizations/jenkins/universal-browser-tests/detail/universal-browser-tests/334/pipeline
2017-07-05T17:54:38 <gtirloni> it failed twice in the browser tests
2017-07-05T17:54:43 <gtirloni> but the 3rd time worked
2017-07-05T17:55:27 <gtirloni> maybe a timing issue? too slow to load infusion or something?
2017-07-05T17:55:28 <Justin_o> that\'s strange... cacheing?
2017-07-05T17:56:13 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure what of the code there would use fluid.tabble.. was there anything there that was UI related?

2017-07-05T18:43:20 <gtirloni_> looks like a connection issue (DNS cache in your machine maybe).. i\'d try disconnecting/connecting from the local network (if it\'s wired, pull the plug.. if it\'s wireless, disconnect). that should clear the cache and try to find the DNS address again
2017-07-05T18:44:24 <danayo> thanks gtirloni_, when you say disconnect, is it enough to turn my device wi-fi on and off?
2017-07-05T18:44:31 <gtirloni_> yep, should be
