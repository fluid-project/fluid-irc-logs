2017-08-28T14:56:46 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Won't be able to do standup today; Friday I worked on UIO unit tests, and got all of them working. Then I started looking into the Wordpress UIO plugin, and that'll be what I'm putting my time in for today.

2017-08-28T15:26:26 <gmoss> hello, ussjoin!
2017-08-28T15:30:00 <ussjoin> How's it going?

2017-08-28T16:07:34 <Bosmon> Hey there cindyli
2017-08-28T16:07:46 <Bosmon> I wonder if you could look at a little Infusion pull for me - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/843
2017-08-28T16:08:08 <Bosmon> This will be part of a series of updates which help michelled with getting her gpii-app tests to run again
2017-08-28T16:08:23 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - some of your TAP code is affected so it would be great if you could take a look as well
2017-08-28T16:08:50 <Bosmon> As far as I can tell, the TAP output still looks fine if the option is enabled, and I think your output function was already sufficiently guarded without the extra workflow in the uncaught exception handler
2017-08-28T16:09:13 <Bosmon> The work is described by https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6188 and also https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5920
2017-08-28T16:15:17 <cindyli> will do, Bosmon
2017-08-28T16:39:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Will do, but on the morrow.

2017-08-28T18:23:03 <amatas> hi ussjoin, seems that the configuration needed to send the logs to ES is almost there: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/logging-elasticsearch-kibana/ , http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_ES_Stream.html . But I think that is not too easy for us to tackle it now. But of course it will be one of our next steps.

2017-08-28T18:23:28 <ussjoin> Totally fine---like I said, I was wondering if there was a super-easy win available. Thank you for explaining that (sadly) there's not. :-)
