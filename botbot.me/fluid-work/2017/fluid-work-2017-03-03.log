2017-03-03T13:06:18 <stegru> javjarfer: yes?
2017-03-03T13:07:46 <javjarfer> stegru, hi! I wanted to ask you something about the mocking messages to windows
2017-03-03T13:07:56 <stegru> ok
2017-03-03T13:08:00 <stegru> hi
2017-03-03T13:09:47 <javjarfer> the LParam when you are sending a WM_SETTINGCHANGE, is the pointer to the string describing what changed, how do you normally use that parameter?
2017-03-03T13:10:22 <stegru> you can leave it out
2017-03-03T13:10:47 <stegru> make it 0
2017-03-03T13:11:13 <stegru> it can be a string of "Environment" or some other terms, but that\'s only used for certain cases
2017-03-03T13:11:21 <javjarfer> stegru, but if the message consumption, is up to implementation, they could filter the WM_SETTINGCHANGE that doesn\'t have that field, and that could be the reason why we don\'t see any changes in the taskbar
2017-03-03T13:11:32 <javjarfer> true?
2017-03-03T13:11:42 <stegru> yes, it\'s up to the implementation
2017-03-03T13:11:57 <stegru> they might not even be listening to that message
2017-03-03T13:12:50 <stegru> I think that\'s the case.. they assume the only way the preferences will be changes is via the menu or options dialog
2017-03-03T13:13:46 <stegru> this message is normally sent by the system when global settings have changed (for example, see SystemParametersInfo)
2017-03-03T13:14:23 <javjarfer> stegru, so there is no way, to see all the "events" that window is receiving true? The fact of something being clicked send messages, but also triggers the normal GUI framework hooks that don\'t offer any introspection mechanism, am I right with this?
2017-03-03T13:14:33 <javjarfer> okay, good to know
2017-03-03T13:15:01 <stegru> for who to see the events? us, or our code?
2017-03-03T13:15:14 <javjarfer> yes, an external viewer
2017-03-03T13:15:29 <stegru> spy++, comes with visual studio
2017-03-03T13:17:31 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-03-03T13:17:45 <javjarfer> yes yes, and it shows us all the messages the windows is receiving, I think I\'m going to reformulate the question. "Clicking" doesn\'t offer any homologous message, that when send trigger the same action it does.
2017-03-03T13:17:50 <javjarfer> true?
2017-03-03T13:19:07 <stegru> i\'m not fully sure what you mean by that
2017-03-03T13:19:30 <javjarfer> ok
2017-03-03T13:20:15 <stegru> in most cases, if I sent the WM_CLICK (or WM_LMOUSEDOWN/UP) message, then it\'s usually the same as clicking with your mouse
2017-03-03T13:20:39 <javjarfer> okay, that was the question
2017-03-03T13:20:56 <javjarfer> even in menus that currently are not shown?
2017-03-03T13:21:03 <stegru> that\'s the way it used to be.. with newer Windows 8/10 applications, I\'m not sure if that\'s accurate
2017-03-03T13:21:35 <javjarfer> that could be very good news, but... I\'m also not sure
2017-03-03T13:21:41 <stegru> no, for menus you don\'t send a mouse event.. you sent WM_NOTIFY with the menu id (or position)
2017-03-03T13:22:20 <stegru> but, that\'s only for normal windows menus.. I have the feeling for the taskbar they\'ve made their own menu because it "feels" different
2017-03-03T13:23:20 <stegru> I do have another trick for things like this..
2017-03-03T13:24:01 <javjarfer> yes... It could be, but I didn\'t know that approach, so I\'m going to try to confirm if we could use it in other sceneries
2017-03-03T13:24:04 <javjarfer> which one?
2017-03-03T13:24:09 <stegru> using Process Monitor (procmon), I would find where the registry key is being written, and look at the call stack
2017-03-03T13:24:58 <javjarfer> ahh yes... I haven\'t consider that possibility yet, I have used it simply to see which settings the program trigger
2017-03-03T13:25:07 <javjarfer> but not to fake the call stack
2017-03-03T13:25:12 <stegru> i\'d then just use a combination of luck and intuition to identify some sort of api call that was used
2017-03-03T13:26:24 <stegru> well, if i found a function called "EnableSearchButton" in the stack, then I would try calling that myself
2017-03-03T13:26:54 <stegru> I know I\'m dreaming, but that\'s the type of thing I\'d do
2017-03-03T13:27:41 <javjarfer> yes, it\'s one more technique for a concrete one... But that is the kind of approximation which I want to leave idle for now, because it makes the onboarding process special and unique for every item
2017-03-03T13:27:59 <stegru> yeh, that;s right
2017-03-03T13:28:03 <javjarfer> and... getting a more standard procedure will be nice
2017-03-03T13:28:05 <javjarfer> yeh
2017-03-03T13:28:06 <stegru> it\'s painful
2017-03-03T13:28:29 <javjarfer> yes...
2017-03-03T13:29:37 <javjarfer> stegru, thanks you! I think I have all I need to continue with this research

2017-03-03T19:45:45 <cindyli> hi avtar, most values in the returned data from https://qi-backend.gpii.net/a/p4a-test/nuts-and-bolts/ci are in the range of 1-10, but there are a few large numbers like 28, 31. so the y axis ended up ranging btw 0-35 and the graph is small
2017-03-03T19:46:49 <cindyli> i\'m thinking the graph would look better if you can modify the mocked returned json to get rid of those big values. what do you think?
