2017-06-15T19:13:20 <jhung> The cognitive load on that diagram is pretty heavy Caren, danayo
2017-06-15T19:13:52 <jhung> I agree with simplifying it.
2017-06-15T19:14:24 <jhung> Yeah. The donuts.
2017-06-15T19:16:33 <jhung> There's a flow to it which you need to follow, and parsing all that isn't clear.
2017-06-15T19:18:15 <jhung> ie. Make the Try suggestions more interesting.

2017-06-15T14:17:00 <alanharnum> michelled: yeah me too - this was a bad one
2017-06-15T14:17:27 <michelled> that sucks
2017-06-15T14:17:37 <michelled> colin and I will be talking to Trebor tomorrow - just to get some more details
2017-06-15T14:17:52 <michelled> I took a quick look at Bloodhound https://v1.statamic.com/add-ons/bloodhound/overview
2017-06-15T14:17:59 <alanharnum> OK - I\'m catching up on the emails now & see they have a repository, etc
2017-06-15T14:18:17 <michelled> I think it will not be a huge amount of work - but of course it will depend on how they\'ve built out the site
2017-06-15T14:18:28 <alanharnum> yah
2017-06-15T14:18:55 <michelled> I don\'t think Trebor will be able to give us any technical details or anything - we\'ll more be trying to scope our involvement
2017-06-15T14:19:17 <alanharnum> my ballpark in mind for this right now is at least 3-4 days, some of them requiring getting an environment set up locally to work with the techology, etc
2017-06-15T14:19:36 <michelled> I was thinking two weeks :)
2017-06-15T14:19:46 <michelled> but I guess I was thinking elapsed time rather then working time
2017-06-15T14:20:11 * danayo joined the channel
2017-06-15T14:20:12 <alanharnum> the implementation itself does not seem that complicated, but it\'s always hard to tell with a new tech stack
2017-06-15T14:20:23 <michelled> yeah
2017-06-15T14:20:32 <michelled> and it\'s clear that we won\'t be able to reuse the work for anything else
2017-06-15T14:20:38 <alanharnum> yup
2017-06-15T14:21:14 <alanharnum> when are you talking to Trebor tomorrow?

2017-06-15T14:33:54 <alanharnum> michelled: yeah, I think it\'s worthwhile for me to be on it
2017-06-15T14:34:16 <michelled> great, we are skyping

2017-06-15T14:39:26 <gloob> gtirloni: it seems made for IoD-Windows
2017-06-15T14:40:01 <gloob> but I feel that could create many problems, were are this apps running? are they accessible?
2017-06-15T14:40:06 <gloob> s/were/where
2017-06-15T14:40:32 <gloob> gtirloni: it seems I need to testing.
2017-06-15T14:41:43 <gtirloni> gloob: does it need expensive infrastructure to "stream" the app from a central place to the clients?
2017-06-15T14:41:53 <gloob> gtirloni: I don\'t have a clue
2017-06-15T14:43:09 <Bosmon7> Thanks cindyli - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/33 is ready for another round of review
2017-06-15T14:43:33 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon7. will have a look soon

2017-06-15T14:46:38 <gtirloni> gloob: LOL
2017-06-15T14:47:19 <alanharnum> gtirloni gloob: if this is the technology I\'m thinking of, it is used by organizations that have a large lab or public computing presence to simplify things like providing access to Microsoft Office without installing it locally on all PCs, and it requires a fair amount of investment in Microsoft-specific technology for managing large-scale deploys
2017-06-15T14:47:33 <gtirloni> i remember reading something about app-v where, if i understood it right at the time, was a way to containerize an app and have increased security (nothing to do with docker containers, etc).. it seemed pretty nice and very lightweight
2017-06-15T14:48:00 <gtirloni> but the infrastructure around it might not be so simple
2017-06-15T14:51:24 * simonjb joined the channel
