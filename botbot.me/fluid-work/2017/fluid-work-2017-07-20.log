2017-07-20T17:46:06 <cindyli> Justin_o: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/FlowManager.md, see APIs section: user login, user logout

2017-07-20T17:49:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, it\'s not working, so maybe there is something wrong with my gpii setup
2017-07-20T17:49:40 <cindyli> :(
2017-07-20T17:49:50 <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: do you know how i\'m supposed to launch gpii.. i\'m just doing "node gpii.js"
2017-07-20T17:49:55 <Justin_o> using the windows vm
2017-07-20T17:50:25 <cindyli> oh, i\'m not familiar with starting GPII on windows
2017-07-20T17:50:44 <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: actually it is working now.. i restarted gpii and it\'s picking up login/logout now
2017-07-20T17:50:55 <cindyli> cheers!
2017-07-20T17:51:08 <jhung> grrrero: Let me check the permissions.
2017-07-20T17:51:15 <grrrero> Thanks jhung
2017-07-20T17:54:07 <jhung> grrrero: I\'ve added the IDRC group (which you\'re a member of) to the Design folder on Own Cloud. You should have access now.

2017-07-20T18:15:24 <Justin_o> cindyli, clown: how do you run the universal tests?
2017-07-20T18:15:52 <cindyli> in a windows vm?
2017-07-20T18:15:55 <clown> Justin_o:  gpii universal tests?
2017-07-20T18:16:25 <Justin_o> clown: yes
2017-07-20T18:16:30 <clown> yes, cindyli asks a good question.  is it windows (or linux) vm, or just the univeral code?
2017-07-20T18:16:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, but also in other places
2017-07-20T18:16:47 <cindyli> Justin_o: gpii windows repo readme has a "test vm" section - https://github.com/gpii/windows
2017-07-20T18:17:01 * michelled joined the channel
2017-07-20T18:17:05 <clown> "running the universal" tests means different things depending on the context.
2017-07-20T18:17:34 <clown> cindyli is correct *if* you are testing the windows version of gpii.
2017-07-20T18:17:45 <Justin_o> clown: what if i just want to run the tests from my mac?
2017-07-20T18:17:47 <clown> but, if you are only testing universal, \xe2\x80\xa6.  let me look it up.
2017-07-20T18:17:55 <clown> or, let me come over.

2017-07-20T12:56:37 <Justin_o> i was going to add some more terms in, related to the work we\'re doing on UIO+
2017-07-20T12:57:35 <kasparnet> ok, try now Justin_o
2017-07-20T12:58:22 <Justin_o> kasparnet: thanks, but i\'m getting the following alert when i try to modify a cell "You are trying to edit a protected cell or object. Please contact the spreadsheet owner to remove protection if you need to edit."

2017-07-20T12:59:31 <kasparnet> sec
2017-07-20T12:59:49 <Justin_o> i tried with a different browser, same issue
2017-07-20T13:01:25 <kasparnet> ok - try again Justin_o
2017-07-20T13:01:40 <kasparnet> I think someone had added a protected range

2017-07-20T13:02:49 <kasparnet> ah great
2017-07-20T13:03:05 <kasparnet> I think you should just put what you think makes sense there
2017-07-20T13:03:24 <Justin_o> kasparnet: okay thanks
2017-07-20T13:04:17 <Justin_o> kasparnet: also for the ISO24751-flat.json5 file.. should i be using  -provisional for all items where there isn\'t currently setting in the ISO24751 spec to match to
2017-07-20T13:05:34 <kasparnet> yeah, that\'d be great

2017-07-20T13:49:54 <Justin_o> kasparnet: could you please remind me how default values are handled, for example font size. Is the default value just never sent as a preference?
2017-07-20T13:50:56 <kasparnet> Justin_o: we\'re actually not taking default values into account at all right now
2017-07-20T13:51:07 <kasparnet> but the plan is to do so in the future
2017-07-20T13:51:23 <Justin_o> kasparnet: okay, i\'m trying to figure out what to do about the text selection hightlight
2017-07-20T13:51:47 <Justin_o> in my current implementation i have two settings, kind of like contrast.. hightlightEnabled and highlightColor
2017-07-20T13:51:49 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-20T13:52:04 <kasparnet> yeah
2017-07-20T13:52:14 <kasparnet> ... you COULD just leave them blank for now
2017-07-20T13:52:18 <Justin_o> but i\'m wondering if i should collapse that down into just colour, because you can\'t tun off highlighting, you can only turn on/off the option to change it
2017-07-20T13:52:31 <kasparnet> (the defaults)
2017-07-20T13:52:58 <kasparnet> "you can only turn on/off the option to change it"
2017-07-20T13:53:04 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-07-20T13:53:05 <kasparnet> I\'m not sure what this means
2017-07-20T13:53:28 <kasparnet> I imagine one *could* use a computer without highlighting turned on :)
2017-07-20T13:53:44 <Justin_o> because it\'s a feature of the browser, you can\'t disable highlighting
2017-07-20T13:53:47 <Justin_o> you can change the colour though
2017-07-20T13:55:16 <Justin_o> kasparnet: ^
2017-07-20T13:55:36 <Justin_o> so right now, if you were to disable the selection highlight you\'d get the default highlighting
2017-07-20T13:56:32 <kasparnet> oh, I see
2017-07-20T13:56:47 <kasparnet> in that case highlightEnabled does seem misleading
2017-07-20T13:57:05 <Justin_o> kasparnet: okay, i\'ll collapse it into one setting
2017-07-20T13:57:06 <Justin_o> thanks
2017-07-20T13:57:32 <kasparnet> I meant "I\'d" :)
2017-07-20T13:57:39 <kasparnet> so being a user who doesn\'t care much about it, they would not have a preference for highlightColor
2017-07-20T13:57:54 <kasparnet> and those who did care would
2017-07-20T13:58:11 <kasparnet> Justin_o: I need to run afk for a bit

2017-07-20T15:51:16 <kasparnet> Ah - you thought I was gonna pull a classic Kasper - but to keep things new, I\'ll actually follow up on my ping straight away
2017-07-20T15:51:27 <kasparnet> I\'m looking at this wonderful issue https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1880
2017-07-20T15:52:38 * kasparnet is looking for link
2017-07-20T15:53:35 <kasparnet> i found that sticking a `limit: "1mb"` in here https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleMiddleware.js#L138 fixes the problem
2017-07-20T15:53:47 <kasparnet> but I wanted to shove that in there by way of our configs of GPII
2017-07-20T15:53:58 <kasparnet> but am failing horribly
2017-07-20T15:54:40 <kasparnet> looking at the fluid.rootComponent tree, I\'m finding this: ["serverEnvironment-bgxcvuin-128"].tests.configuration.server.middlewareHolder.options.components.json path
2017-07-20T15:55:15 <kasparnet> but I\'m on not sure that\'s the right place (at least it doesn\'t seems to work for me)
2017-07-20T15:55:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^

2017-07-20T16:02:45 <kasparnet> ok, I lied
2017-07-20T16:02:49 <kasparnet> (yes, again!)
2017-07-20T16:02:59 <kasparnet> I had just screwed up the paths
2017-07-20T16:03:07 <kasparnet> so I\'ll rephrase my question:
2017-07-20T16:03:36 <kasparnet> is there a more appropriate place to set the payload size limit than in the above path
2017-07-20T16:05:02 * colinclark has quit
2017-07-20T16:08:00 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, the path may be right
2017-07-20T16:08:07 <Bosmon> But I assume you\'re not going to just blindly stuff it in there : P
2017-07-20T16:08:16 <kasparnet> I totally was
2017-07-20T16:08:29 <kasparnet> :)
2017-07-20T16:08:38 <Bosmon> michelled can give you a nice lecture about properly using options distributions rather than massive fragile paths
2017-07-20T16:09:01 <kasparnet> oh, I _was_ gonna use distributeOptions
2017-07-20T16:09:07 <kasparnet> but to that path
2017-07-20T16:09:20 <Bosmon> Damn you
2017-07-20T16:09:20 <kasparnet> although I\'m a bit curious about the lecture :)
2017-07-20T16:09:30 <Bosmon> Look, there\'s a perfectly well-defined grade here
2017-07-20T16:09:34 <Bosmon> Named "kettle.middleware.json"
2017-07-20T16:09:38 <Bosmon> Does that suggest anything to you? : P
2017-07-20T16:11:14 <Bosmon> kasparnet - prod, prod
2017-07-20T16:13:09 <kasparnet> well, it suggests a few different things - but it\'s still not clear to me what the best solution is
2017-07-20T16:13:14 <kasparnet> :(
2017-07-20T16:17:14 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, you can do even better than just hitting that one path by writing something like {that kettle.middleware.json}.options.middlewareOptions.limit
2017-07-20T16:17:21 <Bosmon> This will hit all JSON middleware in the system
2017-07-20T16:18:14 <kasparnet> ooooh, that\'s so clever
2017-07-20T16:18:53 <Bosmon> It\'s not all that clever, it\'s just the way the system was meant to be used : P
