2017-08-15T17:06:00 <grrrero> Justin_o: was just reading your comments re: icon workflow and forgot to ask about what you meant by criteria?
2017-08-15T17:14:06 <Justin_o> grrrero: ah so i mean, you have the actions and the master file to try to standardize the SVG that is output. I think it would be good to document what that output should be. That way, if someone is using something other than Illustrator, doesn\'t want to use the tools you document, or wants to setup their own, they\'ll know what is needed.

2017-08-15T20:28:13 <jhung> grrrero: generally that\'s what I do so I have a local copy to test from. Comments, remarks, etc should go into the pull request.
2017-08-15T20:28:41 <grrrero> Ok jhung!
2017-08-15T20:28:55 <jhung> I\'ll then address the comments and push up changes to the pull request grrrero. That\'s generally how it goes.
