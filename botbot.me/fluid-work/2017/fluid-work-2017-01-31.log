2017-01-31T17:32:05 <Bosmon> kasparnet - did you do a fresh npm install before running them

2017-01-31T18:03:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet - how did you provision the VM to test it?
2017-01-31T18:04:03 <kasparnet> downloaded it to a fresh folder, ran "npm install", "vagrant up", "grunt tests"
2017-01-31T18:04:31 <kasparnet> let me just rerun npm install
2017-01-31T18:04:42 <kasparnet> might have screwed something up there
2017-01-31T18:05:08 <alanharnum> michelled: planning meeting is now, right?
2017-01-31T18:05:49 <danayo> alanharnum:  sounds like we\'re waiting for folks to come back from lunch (winterlicious)
2017-01-31T18:05:50 <michelled> alanharnum: the thing is that the winterlicious crew hasn\'t returned yet
2017-01-31T18:06:00 <michelled> so it would just be 4 of us
2017-01-31T18:06:02 <jessm> i wonder what they\xe2\x80\x99re eating

2017-01-31T18:12:03 <danayo> coming michelled1!
2017-01-31T18:13:45 <mrtyler> jessm: hmm, i\'d say mid-80s origin, late-80s to early-90s widespread popularity?
2017-01-31T18:14:38 <mrtyler> altho i\'m sure the sentence "let\'s get this party started" is older than that
2017-01-31T18:15:18 <mrtyler> embarrassingly, the first song that springs to mind containing that phrase is C + C Music Factory - Here We Go

2017-01-31T18:39:12 <mrtyler> hmm. it just so happens i know the guy who has the north american synthesizer market cornered
2017-01-31T18:39:31 <mrtyler> following a shrewd currency play involving brexit, or something
2017-01-31T18:39:35 <gloob> oh, it seems it is worst that looks like at first

2017-01-31T19:51:30 <Justin_o> just want to make sure i captured your proposal correctly

2017-01-31T20:03:54 <colinclark> Justin_o: I don\'t know what the "not sure" section really points to

2017-01-31T20:45:18 <Justin_o> so one of those we talked about at the planning meeting today
2017-01-31T20:45:45 <Justin_o> i have JIRAs for the other too i can dig up

2017-01-31T20:47:05 <alanharnum> great news, everybody! https://cdnjs.com/libraries/infusion
2017-01-31T20:47:20 <alanharnum> Infusion 2.0.0 now available through cdnjs
2017-01-31T20:47:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'ve put the JIRA numbers next to the items in the not sure sections
2017-01-31T20:48:46 <colinclark> None of those things strike me as related to deprecations, Justin_o
2017-01-31T20:49:22 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool thanks
2017-01-31T20:49:29 <gtirloni> alanharnum: nice! \\o/
2017-01-31T20:49:34 <colinclark> Like I say, keep it simple
2017-01-31T20:49:38 <colinclark> deprecate what we know about
2017-01-31T20:49:45 <colinclark> and don\'t deprecate things we don\'t have a firm plan to change yet
2017-01-31T20:49:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: I removed that section
2017-01-31T20:50:03 <colinclark> we need to be more flexible with Infusion
2017-01-31T20:50:07 <colinclark> less letter-of-the-semver-law
2017-01-31T20:50:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: anything else needed to be added to the deprecations https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6121
2017-01-31T20:50:23 <colinclark> less precise in our procedures, more open in our discussions
2017-01-31T20:50:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: i don\'t think it\'s even in the semver spec per se, but more of a recommendation i believe
2017-01-31T20:51:16 <colinclark> right
2017-01-31T20:51:21 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m thinking of it more as a curtesy to our users
2017-01-31T20:51:27 <colinclark> I know you are
2017-01-31T20:51:32 <colinclark> and that\'s very thoughtful of you
2017-01-31T20:51:35 <Justin_o> although depending on when we release 3.0 it may not matter to them much
2017-01-31T20:52:13 <colinclark> but I do think we\'re overthinking the proceduralism a bit
2017-01-31T20:52:18 <colinclark> it comes from a great and generous place
2017-01-31T20:52:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can\'t think of anything - I imagine the notes of our December meeting would be the best place to look for such stuff
2017-01-31T20:53:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  yah, i have those all captured on the JIRA already

2017-01-31T14:31:12 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli1 - could I just get you to look at a very tiny pull request?
2017-01-31T14:31:14 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/806
2017-01-31T14:31:24 <Bosmon> I\'m wanting to push this through the stack up to universal etc. ...
2017-01-31T14:31:32 <cindyli1> sure, Bosmon

2017-01-31T14:53:06 <Bosmon> Hey there colinclark
2017-01-31T14:53:14 <colinclark> hiya
2017-01-31T14:53:16 <Bosmon> Do you have any further comments on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/103 ?
2017-01-31T14:54:08 <colinclark> I really don\'t know
2017-01-31T14:54:16 <colinclark> and I don\'t think it\'s worth holding it up for me to review it
2017-01-31T14:54:25 <colinclark> since I can only dream of when I\'ll have a moment to look
2017-01-31T14:54:31 <Bosmon> ok, not to worry
2017-01-31T14:54:43 <colinclark> so I think if you\'ve done your best to address the structural suggestions I had, then I\'m happy

2017-01-31T15:23:06 <Bosmon> Cheers cindyli, good question, answered :)
2017-01-31T15:39:39 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-01-31T16:07:06 <Bosmon> Thanks so much for the merge, cindyli :)
2017-01-31T16:07:25 <cindyli> anytime :)
2017-01-31T16:20:53 <Bosmon> Interesting experiments with "npm link"
2017-01-31T16:20:58 <Bosmon> It seems that it really does work on Windows now
2017-01-31T16:21:15 <Bosmon> Unfortunately it works in a way which breaks Infusion\'s self-deduping
2017-01-31T16:22:37 <Bosmon> If you "npm link" to a module which refers to its own infusion, that one loads first, but from a path which the node resolution algorithm doesn\'t expect, and hence loads an infusion which can\'t agree with of those in the main module tree
2017-01-31T16:22:42 <Bosmon> What a mess

2017-01-31T16:43:57 <Bosmon> Hey there kasparnet
2017-01-31T16:43:59 <Bosmon> KASPARDNITT
2017-01-31T16:44:07 <Bosmon> Would you have time to push through this little pul?
2017-01-31T16:44:12 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/499
2017-01-31T16:44:24 <Bosmon> It would be useful to have universal up with the latest versions of our libraries
2017-01-31T16:44:53 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon
2017-01-31T16:45:10 <Bosmon> IT\'S JUST A VERY LITTLE ONE :)
2017-01-31T16:45:16 <kasparnet> sure
2017-01-31T16:45:30 <kasparnet> will look at it now
2017-01-31T16:45:48 <Bosmon> It also features some significantly reduced logging
2017-01-31T16:45:57 <Bosmon> In a style once requested by colinclark
2017-01-31T16:46:08 <Bosmon> Although I couldn\'t find what I thought was the JIRA he filed when I went looking
2017-01-31T16:46:20 <colinclark> ZOMG
2017-01-31T16:46:53 <colinclark> I guess the big logging that I keep meaning to whip up a PR for is when we log all this-ist invocations

2017-01-31T16:57:28 <Bosmon> colinclark - it\'s done
2017-01-31T16:57:37 <colinclark> !!
2017-01-31T16:57:51 <Bosmon> SHIPED!
2017-01-31T16:57:55 <colinclark> I\'ll have to upgrade to a post-2.0.0 release and revel in the silence
2017-01-31T16:58:07 <colinclark> everything just boils down to Depeche Mode today
2017-01-31T16:58:08 <colinclark> ENJOY THE SILENCE
2017-01-31T16:59:26 <mrtyler> all i ever wanted, all i ever needed is logs
2017-01-31T16:59:28 <mrtyler> on my disk
2017-01-31T16:59:40 <mrtyler> space is very unnecessary
2017-01-31T16:59:44 <mrtyler> it can only hdparm

2017-01-31T17:13:07 <colinclark> well done!

2017-01-31T17:17:30 <Bosmon> Probably you have a dirty cache : P
