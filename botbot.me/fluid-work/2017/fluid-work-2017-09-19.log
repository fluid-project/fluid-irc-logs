2017-09-19T16:26:44 <colinclark> unfortunately I have a meeting in 30 minutes
2017-09-19T16:26:48 <colinclark> so the alternative is to reschedule
2017-09-19T16:26:49 <ussjoin> In a few minutes, would be.

2017-09-19T16:46:30 <colinclark> no, I didn\'t
2017-09-19T16:46:49 <colinclark> the fact that I have 25 new emails in the past 10 minutes doesn\'t help :)
2017-09-19T16:46:57 <colinclark> but I definitely got it this time

2017-09-19T19:16:15 <cindyli> are you thinking to pass the current date in as a function argument?
2017-09-19T19:16:46 <cindyli> i think it\'s a good idea.
2017-09-19T19:16:51 <simonjb> yes, that\'s an option that I was thinking of
2017-09-19T19:17:15 <cindyli> sounds you have other options too
2017-09-19T19:17:37 <simonjb> I\'m also interested in consistency and what we do in other parts of GPII (if we have other date processing)
2017-09-19T19:18:21 <simonjb> Bosmon: if you had some time, it would be great to get your input on https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/519#discussion_r139700670
2017-09-19T19:23:46 <cindyli> i searched the gpii code base by the keyword "date", in context manager and journal, date() are directly called in functions

2017-09-19T19:28:48 <gmoss> or just get together, I have a few questions
2017-09-19T19:29:21 <alanharnum> gmoss: let me make a time and we can chat
2017-09-19T19:29:27 <alanharnum> er, make a tea
2017-09-19T19:29:32 <alanharnum> :p
2017-09-19T19:29:38 <gmoss> alanharnum: making time would be super impressive :)
2017-09-19T19:29:44 <alanharnum> if only
2017-09-19T19:29:55 <cindyli> simonjb: no unit tests for those functions

2017-09-19T08:36:59 <Bosmon> Morning, VVERNNANDDEZZ :)
2017-09-19T08:37:12 <jhernandez> wrt https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/551, I guess it\'s a device reporter thing
2017-09-19T08:37:32 <Bosmon> Sure, sure
2017-09-19T08:37:56 <jhernandez> so, I tested it on gpii-app, which uses the dynamic device reporter
2017-09-19T08:38:02 <Bosmon> But isn\'t that nonsensical?
2017-09-19T08:38:12 <Bosmon> One would expect that the chrome extension is "always installed"
2017-09-19T08:38:17 <jhernandez> nonsensical?
2017-09-19T08:38:52 <jhernandez> yeah, it should go into the installedSolutions file
2017-09-19T08:39:13 <jhernandez> when using the dynamic device reporter it\'s "alwaysInstalled"
2017-09-19T08:39:39 <jhernandez> but I\'m just seeing that is not included in the installedSolutions file
2017-09-19T08:40:00 <Bosmon> ok
2017-09-19T08:40:27 <Bosmon> I guess we never actually test the solution
2017-09-19T08:40:34 <Bosmon> Just the settings handler
2017-09-19T08:42:53 <jhernandez> yes
2017-09-19T08:43:29 <jhernandez> in tests we trust :)
2017-09-19T08:43:49 <Bosmon> Well, even tests can only test the things that are tested
2017-09-19T08:43:57 <Bosmon> We trust even more in the review process : P
2017-09-19T08:44:13 <jhernandez> heh
2017-09-19T08:44:17 <Bosmon> But even that can often let us down
2017-09-19T08:44:46 <Bosmon> For example, the review received by the PCP API was clearly inadequate : P

2017-09-19T12:02:02 <Bosmon> Your JIRA report mentions Array.concat
2017-09-19T12:02:07 <Bosmon> But you haven\'t changed any Array.concat calls
2017-09-19T12:02:58 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2017-09-19T12:03:03 <Bosmon> You just left the existing one there
2017-09-19T12:12:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah exactly
2017-09-19T12:12:16 <kasparnet> I dropped passing a reference to the array around instead
2017-09-19T12:15:42 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-19T12:22:00 <Bosmon> Cool
2017-09-19T12:22:07 <Bosmon> I\'m in two minds about which approach is best
2017-09-19T12:22:11 <Bosmon> But I think what you have done is ok
2017-09-19T12:22:18 <Bosmon> We write enough global state in the transformer anyway
2017-09-19T12:28:06 <kasparnet> yeah, I wasn\'t sure either
2017-09-19T12:28:18 <kasparnet> I can easily change the concat instead, if you think that is better
2017-09-19T12:28:36 <kasparnet> should take around 5 mins and another run of the tests

2017-09-19T12:31:04 <Bosmon> I guess it generates a touch less garbage to share it
2017-09-19T12:31:43 <Bosmon> Which is something the framework needs to get a lot more careful about
2017-09-19T12:32:13 <kasparnet> what do you mean with "share it"?
2017-09-19T12:32:27 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - could I get you to look at a little pull for me?
2017-09-19T12:32:33 <Bosmon> I know it\'s very early, no hurry :)
2017-09-19T12:32:34 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/846/files
2017-09-19T12:32:40 <kasparnet> as in passing the reference around instead of the transformer object?
2017-09-19T12:32:45 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I mean, to share the object reference rather than continually rebinding it
2017-09-19T12:32:51 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2017-09-19T12:34:07 <Bosmon> kasparnet - just a heads up that I\'ll probably be doing a bit of work on the transformer shortly, in a not totally dissimilar area
2017-09-19T12:34:09 <Bosmon> For https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6194 -
2017-09-19T12:34:36 <Bosmon> The transformer needs to be a bit less blase about when it fails to invert something
2017-09-19T12:34:57 <Bosmon> It\'s no good just giving back the user whatever it managed to do, either it has made an inverse or it hasn\'t : P
2017-09-19T12:35:26 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2017-09-19T12:35:36 <Bosmon> So if any part of a complex transform fails to invert, we need to return a special code from invertConfiguration to indicate that it has failed
2017-09-19T12:36:32 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2017-09-19T12:36:34 <Bosmon> Hopefully this won\'t disturb any existing users of the transformer
2017-09-19T12:36:39 <Bosmon> And if it does, they have other problems : P
2017-09-19T12:36:55 <kasparnet> what about grey area stuff then... like an imprecise inversion
2017-09-19T12:37:15 <Bosmon> THat\'s fine
2017-09-19T12:37:30 <Bosmon> But if there is an entire rule that has no inverse at all, we need to throw that out
2017-09-19T12:38:00 <Bosmon> There are many rules that quite deliberately have no inverse
2017-09-19T12:38:31 <Bosmon> Hilariously the relay system has been getting by with the fact that in many cases the system returns an empty transform as the inverse, when then doesn\'t propagate any values when you try to use it
2017-09-19T12:38:48 <Bosmon> But FLUID-6194 exposed the fact that the relay system still THINKS it is running a reverse transform even when there isn\'t one
2017-09-19T12:39:08 <Bosmon> And so in the case when it is relaying a DELETE, ends up trashing the model on the other side of the link
2017-09-19T12:39:51 <kasparnet> ah yeah
2017-09-19T12:40:02 <Bosmon> And worse, in the case of a compound transform we may get a mangled kind of inversion back that just ends up corrupting the data on the other side in any case
2017-09-19T12:40:28 <Bosmon> If the top-level transform is invertible, and a nested one isn\'t, I expect the current algorithm is just going to give you a mangled wreck

2017-09-19T14:10:07 <jhernandez> Bosmon: back to https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/551, do you want me to include uio+ solution into the infamous installedSolutions file? or do you think it should be just fine as it is (that is reported as always installed when using the dynamic device reporter)?
2017-09-19T14:10:25 * avtar1 joined the channel
2017-09-19T14:14:57 <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes please add it to installedSolutions

2017-09-19T14:36:52 <jhernandez> ok, done
2017-09-19T14:37:11 <Bosmon> jhernandez - awesome, I\'ll give it another test
2017-09-19T14:44:58 <stegru> jhernandez: are you producing a new build for the pilots this week?
2017-09-19T14:45:25 <jhernandez> Bosmon: awesome, thanks!!
2017-09-19T14:45:43 <jhernandez> stegru: that\'s the idea, yes
2017-09-19T14:45:59 <jhernandez> why are you asking?
2017-09-19T14:46:01 <stegru> when?
2017-09-19T14:46:11 <stegru> just wondering when my cut-off point is
2017-09-19T14:46:17 <jhernandez> haha
2017-09-19T14:47:27 <jhernandez> well, from my perspective, I\'d say ASAP
2017-09-19T14:47:48 <jhernandez> it\'s about your metrics pr?
2017-09-19T14:48:25 <stegru> yeh, javi
2017-09-19T14:50:56 <jhernandez> ideally, we should have it ready ASAP for kavya to test it
2017-09-19T14:51:11 <Bosmon> jhernandez - it works!
2017-09-19T14:51:17 <jhernandez> Bosmon: weee!!!!!
2017-09-19T14:51:19 <Bosmon> I merged your snapsets pull, thanks
2017-09-19T14:51:30 <jhernandez> Bosmon: great, thanks a lot!!
2017-09-19T14:51:56 <kavya> :)
2017-09-19T14:53:28 <jhernandez> stegru: how are you doing with the pr? is it almost ready? or will it need some more time?
2017-09-19T14:54:02 <stegru> both, jhernandez :)
2017-09-19T14:54:12 <stegru> i can make one now
2017-09-19T14:55:13 * jhernandez is confused
2017-09-19T14:55:15 <jhernandez> xD
2017-09-19T15:02:30 <stegru> I\'m submitting what I\'ve done so far, but there\'s more to do still. I\'ll save that for another time
