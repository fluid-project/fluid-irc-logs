2017-03-20T11:20:22 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, here is an up-to-date and (as far as I can tell) complete coverage report for Infusion: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-coverage-20170320/
2017-03-20T11:20:42 <the-t-in-rtf> The line you mentioned (Fluid.js:1002) is now covered, for example.
2017-03-20T11:21:19 <the-t-in-rtf> The discrepancy was down to failures to load the coverage sender, which (after long investigation) were down to not having loaded FluidIoC and other key dependencies of the coverage sender itself.
2017-03-20T11:22:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I am reviewing some minor coverage transmission errors and twitchy tests at the moment, I will commit what I have for your review in a bit.
2017-03-20T11:22:44 <the-t-in-rtf> With my new harness I can tell that between all browsers, every test suite was hit, so I would not expect the report to change.

2017-03-20T12:16:16 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - great news!
2017-03-20T12:17:24 <Bosmon> Adds about 2% to the branch coverage of Fluid.js
2017-03-20T12:17:29 <Bosmon> Why, it\'s almost acceptable : P

2017-03-20T13:06:00 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, are there any tests in FluidStandaloneJS-tests.html not already covered elsewhere?
2017-03-20T13:06:10 <the-t-in-rtf> The "fake" jQuery plays havoc with Testem\xe2\x89\xa5
2017-03-20T13:07:48 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the tests are just the same
2017-03-20T13:08:02 <Bosmon> You can see that they are all encoded in FluidJSTests.js
2017-03-20T13:08:26 <Bosmon> HASS HASS! DIFF DIFF!
2017-03-20T13:09:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, then I will remove the instrumentation for those tests.
2017-03-20T13:09:32 <the-t-in-rtf> That is one of the few remaining failures.
2017-03-20T13:09:47 <the-t-in-rtf> There is a browser disconnect, which I solved for Chrome with tuning options.
2017-03-20T13:09:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Working on the same for Firefox.
2017-03-20T13:10:12 <the-t-in-rtf> then you should be able to consistently run your own coverage reports.

2017-03-20T13:20:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Seems like the failure happens even if I disable coverage reporting.  Testing with infusion master now to confirm that those tests work.
2017-03-20T13:21:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I get errors like "this.afterTestsQueue is undefined"
2017-03-20T13:21:36 <the-t-in-rtf> That sound familiar, @Bosmon (or anyone)?
2017-03-20T13:39:55 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-03-20T13:40:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Ugh.   I had put in jury-rigged "dye pack" in the first test, which blew up any test that ran after it.
2017-03-20T13:42:29 <Bosmon> "DYE PACK"?
2017-03-20T13:43:02 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - what kind of tuning options are required to make Chrome work?
2017-03-20T13:43:26 <the-t-in-rtf> There are various ones mentioned here: https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/777
2017-03-20T13:43:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Searching for the exact comment, just a sec.
2017-03-20T13:43:57 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/testem/testem/issues/777#issuecomment-265289473
2017-03-20T13:44:05 <the-t-in-rtf> That, and setting my own user dir, seemed to help.
2017-03-20T13:44:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I will gradually peel off layers of belts and braces before submitting the work for review.
2017-03-20T13:44:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Hopefully only the one flag is needed.
2017-03-20T13:49:38 <Bosmon> You had to set the memory pressure flag?

2017-03-20T13:57:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, the "dye pack" was a bunch of extra logging listeners wired into the global QUnit and Testem variables.

2017-03-20T14:01:41 <the-t-in-rtf1> Apparently \xe2\x80\x94memory-off also works.
2017-03-20T14:01:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> Just confirmed that in the last pass.

2017-03-20T15:01:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> Hi, @mrtyler, I\'m opening my vidyo room shortly.
2017-03-20T15:01:11 <mrtyler> great thx
2017-03-20T15:01:56 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf1, JJ also wants to join us, could you give us the room\'s url?
2017-03-20T15:02:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> where can I find that?
2017-03-20T15:02:41 <gtirloni> in the contact list, click your room, then in the pane that shows up, there\'s a 3-dotted buttom

2017-03-20T16:03:41 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, it\'s not nyc by itself, node also fails to run the tests.
2017-03-20T16:03:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> It may be a child_process.exec problem.
2017-03-20T16:03:57 <the-t-in-rtf1> in any case I have enough to troubleshoot further.
2017-03-20T16:03:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> Thanks everyone!
2017-03-20T16:05:11 <gtirloni> amatas the-t-in-rtf1: are we having another meeting about the plugin?
2017-03-20T16:05:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> Oh, one question for @amatas, @avtar and others, when do we need to use do.ps1 to run commands?
2017-03-20T16:05:49 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-03-20T16:06:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> @gtirloni, I think it would be good to revisit in 2-3 weeks
2017-03-20T16:06:13 <gtirloni> any time you depend on the command you want to run to have access to the desktop (or as windows call it, "console", afaik)
2017-03-20T16:06:38 <gtirloni> otherwise the command will run in its own separate session, with no desktop support
2017-03-20T16:06:38 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf1: only when a process needs to interact with the windowing environment
2017-03-20T16:06:39 <avtar> ah nm
2017-03-20T16:06:41 <avtar> :P
