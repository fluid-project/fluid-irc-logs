2017-09-25T17:51:32 <michelled> grrrero: if you'd like to pair, we can talk in a few minutes
2017-09-25T17:54:19 <grrrero> michelled: It's a bit noisy right now; got people working on the dishwasher -- maybe later?
2017-09-25T18:00:09 <michelled> grrrero: sure, just ping me
2017-09-25T18:00:14 <grrrero> Ok!
2017-09-25T18:02:07 <gmoss> alanharnum, I'm currently putting together a simple project to isolate and test the composite event bug
2017-09-25T18:02:26 <gmoss> fyi
2017-09-25T18:02:31 <gmoss> :)
2017-09-25T18:02:38 <alanharnum> gmoss: great - that will be useful to isolate where the issue is
2017-09-25T18:03:18 <gmoss> alanharnum: indeed, and hopefully it's reproducible. if not, well then we'll have an interesting time ahead
2017-09-25T18:04:18 <michelled> grrrero: will you be in the office tomorrow?
2017-09-25T18:05:20 <grrrero> michelled: Yep
2017-09-25T18:06:52 <michelled> grrrero, gmoss: perhaps we can move our meeting to tomorrow afternoon then
2017-09-25T18:07:19 <gmoss> michelled grrrero any time tomorrow after 2 PM works for me!
2017-09-25T18:08:00 <grrrero> michelled: For sure. Thanks so much -- totally forgot about it and had an incident with the dishwasher this morning so :\\
2017-09-25T18:08:26 <michelled> no worries, we'll talk tomorrow
2017-09-25T18:08:33 <grrrero> Thanks!!

2017-09-25T19:29:11 <grrrero> avtar: michelled and I were wondering what the reason was behind having 2 navbars (one for normal desktop and one for mobile/responsive) in the SJRK website?
2017-09-25T19:30:44 <avtar> i'm not sure tbh
2017-09-25T19:30:52 <avtar> that's been the design since the site's inception
2017-09-25T19:30:59 <avtar> danayo: ^
2017-09-25T19:32:02 <michelled> avtar: the question was more about the markup rather then the design. I didn't look closely, but it felt to me like we could use the same markup and style it differently when in responsive mode
2017-09-25T19:45:13 <avtar> michelled: ah gotcha
2017-09-25T19:46:27 <avtar> i didn't really reflect on that
2017-09-25T19:47:36 <avtar> the markup changes i proposed were just enough to integrate uio
2017-09-25T19:48:14 <michelled> ah, that markup was in there from before.
2017-09-25T19:49:23 <avtar> yup
2017-09-25T19:50:53 <michelled> alanharnum: we were wondering about the SJRK site markup - it looked to me like it might be possible to have the nav bar marked up only once and style it differentely in responsive mode
2017-09-25T19:51:04 <michelled> is there a reason we shouldn't go down this road?
2017-09-25T20:00:21 <alanharnum> michelled: I don't see why not
2017-09-25T20:00:55 <alanharnum> it might have been necessary to have different structural markup at one point, but if this can be done away with in favour of pure CSS, I'm all for it
2017-09-25T20:01:08 <michelled> great, thanks
2017-09-25T20:01:19 <michelled> grrrero: my other meeting is over - want to pair again?
2017-09-25T20:01:35 <grrrero> Sure
2017-09-25T20:01:41 <grrrero> Call now?

2017-09-25T11:08:00 <javjarfer> hi everyone! Does anyone have experience adding new common terms? I have a test failing and I think I have identified the problem, but I don\'t know where to make the proper changes to make it work again, also because I don\'t fully understand the purpose of the test
2017-09-25T11:08:20 <javjarfer> I have this test failing https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/482/console
2017-09-25T11:08:48 <javjarfer> in the line \'16:40:45.459:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.preferencesServer.config.standard tests" Test name "GET:\'
2017-09-25T11:10:03 <javjarfer> problem is I have added a new common term, https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/GPII-2521/testData/ontologies/mappings/ISO24751-flat.json5#L58
2017-09-25T11:11:27 <javjarfer> and in the block  \'"metadata": [
2017-09-25T11:11:27 <javjarfer> {
2017-09-25T11:11:27 <javjarfer> "type": "doNotShare",
2017-09-25T11:11:27 <javjarfer> "scope": [\' this term is not expected

2017-09-25T11:14:23 <javjarfer> thing is that I\'m not understanding the mapping of scopes that is being done in test, and why some things are expected, and others aren\'t

2017-09-25T11:43:57 <Bosmon> javjarfer - looks like a few bits of information went missing in your paste
2017-09-25T11:44:17 <Bosmon> There isn\'t a test named just "GET" but they all have some extra text after that start
2017-09-25T11:44:21 <Bosmon> But I imagine your failing test is one of these
2017-09-25T11:44:22 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTests.js#L174
2017-09-25T11:44:34 <Bosmon> In which case I imagine you can just add your new preference into the "expected" block
2017-09-25T11:44:43 <Bosmon> If it\'s not right, kasparne_ will fix it during review :)

2017-09-25T13:45:03 * clown joined the channel
2017-09-25T13:52:40 <Bosmon> javjarfer_ - I think you will just need to add it into that list at the bottom
2017-09-25T13:53:12 <Bosmon> javjarfer_ - but, why don\'t you just check what the discrepancy is between the expected and actual results
2017-09-25T13:53:17 * danailbd__ is now known as dandimitrov
2017-09-25T13:53:54 <javjarfer_> Bosmon, the discrepancy is that the expected results doesn\'t show the key
2017-09-25T13:54:26 <javjarfer_> sorry, the common term* wallpaper, while the actual results shows it

2017-09-25T14:01:26 <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for that, I was slightly worried I\'d got the wrong room :) I\'ll sign back on when it\'s wrapped up
2017-09-25T14:02:39 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, it\'s free.
2017-09-25T14:04:42 <the-t-in-rtf> @alanharnum, @Bosmon, meeting time.
2017-09-25T14:08:15 <javjarfer_> Bosmon, I think that even if the test crash is referencing this line https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTests.js#L180, problem is related with this get https://github.com/JavierJF/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTests.js#L576 which is the one which that data as expected paylaod

2017-09-25T15:34:02 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb, replying..
2017-09-25T15:37:56 <Bosmon> javjarfer_ - it\'s a bit rubbish but you may have to rely on JSON iteration order which as we know is not defined until ES2015
2017-09-25T15:39:53 <Bosmon> I guess we could argue that ES2015 is here now - apparently my version of Chrome complies with everything other than tail call elimination...
2017-09-25T15:40:34 <javjarfer_> Bosmon, so, do you think it\'s time to impose an additional order there?
2017-09-25T15:41:04 <Bosmon> I think you can rely that the insertion order will be stable, in the environments we are interested in
2017-09-25T15:41:30 <javjarfer_> Bosmon, ok, then I will follow the same flow for future modifications
2017-09-25T15:41:34 <javjarfer_> thanks you
