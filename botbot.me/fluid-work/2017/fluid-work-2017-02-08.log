b'2017-02-08T18:14:16 <Bosmon> WHat does a github releases URL look like?
2017-02-08T18:14:27 <amatas> zip files are supported by windows
2017-02-08T18:14:53 <gloob> liekhttps://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.6.0
2017-02-08T18:15:16 <gloob> no sorry
2017-02-08T18:15:17 <gloob> https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.6.0/chromedriver-v2.21-darwin-x64.zip
2017-02-08T18:15:25 <gloob> better then
2017-02-08T18:15:34 <gloob> releases/download/versions/thing.zop
2017-02-08T18:15:39 <amatas> seems pretty descriptive
2017-02-08T18:16:14 <Bosmon> Looks like they have an HTTP API
2017-02-08T18:16:23 <Bosmon> Do we know of any command-line tools which wrap this up?
2017-02-08T18:16:31 <amatas> we also could have a checksum file to check the integrity of the file, adding some security to the process https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.6.0/SHASUMS256.txt
2017-02-08T18:17:35 <amatas> doing a quick google search https://github.com/aktau/github-release
2017-02-08T18:17:45 <Bosmon> https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release
2017-02-08T18:18:46 <avtar> amatas: that repo doesn\'t look like it\'s been getting any love
2017-02-08T18:18:52 <amatas> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5207269/releasing-a-build-artifact-on-github
2017-02-08T18:18:58 <Bosmon> Yeah
2017-02-08T18:18:59 <avtar> another one: https://github.com/c4milo/github-release
2017-02-08T18:19:02 <Bosmon> He did at least cut releases himself :)
2017-02-08T18:19:03 <Bosmon> https://github.com/aktau/github-release/releases
2017-02-08T18:19:51 <colinclark> Bosmon: Where does the "guts" of our TTS implementation live?
2017-02-08T18:20:05 <colinclark> I guess we\'ve got TTS working in two places\xe2\x80\x94first discovery and in the chart authoring tool
2017-02-08T18:20:15 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js
2017-02-08T18:20:17 <colinclark> is there a shared set of components that is used for cuing utterances, etc.
2017-02-08T18:20:18 <Bosmon> It lives in here
2017-02-08T18:20:20 <colinclark> ah, perfect
2017-02-08T18:20:55 <Bosmon> As we know, the current browsers have fairly severe bugs in their TTS implementations ...
2017-02-08T18:21:42 <gloob> so releases?
2017-02-08T18:21:56 <gloob> that means create an specific repository
2017-02-08T18:22:15 <Bosmon> gloob - repository for what - windows provisioning scripts?
2017-02-08T18:22:15 <amatas> github releases seems fine for me, as we are going to use for the installer as well
2017-02-08T18:22:43 <gloob> Bosmon: yes
2017-02-08T18:23:10 <gloob> Bosmon: windows bootstrapping scripts or not, something to think about
2017-02-08T18:23:19 <Bosmon> gloob - it seems like a reasonable possibility
2017-02-08T18:23:23 <gloob> ok
2017-02-08T18:23:40 <Bosmon> We should let some others such as alanharnum and colinclark weigh in as well - I imagine it\'s worth an explicit proposal on the GPII arch mailing list
2017-02-08T18:23:52 <gloob> got it
2017-02-08T18:24:07 <colinclark> What should I weigh in on?
2017-02-08T18:25:07 <Bosmon> colinclark - at arch we were talking about "how to package and distribute little things"
2017-02-08T18:25:07 <gloob> what and how to approach the no-replication of main PS1 library for bootstrapping of windows repos
2017-02-08T18:25:26 <colinclark> What are some examples of some little things?
2017-02-08T18:25:37 <colinclark> kittens, ducklings, hamsters
2017-02-08T18:25:40 <Bosmon> Such as, but not limited to, windows build scripts, or perhaps vagrant provisioning instructions
2017-02-08T18:25:43 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Provisioning.psm1
2017-02-08T18:25:59 <gloob> all that is outside of our current npm system
2017-02-08T18:26:44 <Bosmon> I made a proposal above based on "raw npm tarball URLs" but it seems that "github releases" is looking like a safer bet, being based around .zip files
2017-02-08T18:26:59 <colinclark> yeah
2017-02-08T18:27:02 <gloob> Bosmon: where the npm tarballs lives?
2017-02-08T18:27:09 <gloob> npmjs.org?
2017-02-08T18:27:51 <colinclark> .com
2017-02-08T18:27:57 <colinclark> in THE registry
2017-02-08T18:28:48 <amatas> Bosmon, vagrant is used to create the testing environment using virtual machines, and then it executes the scripts defined in the config file inside that environment. Vagrant and the bootstraping scripts are in two different stages.
2017-02-08T18:29:10 <Bosmon> They are, yes
2017-02-08T18:29:19 <Bosmon> But they still represent some kind of "modular reuse requirement"
2017-02-08T18:30:04 <Bosmon> No doubt, "outside", as gloob observes, "of our current npm system"
2017-02-08T18:34:12 <amatas> I need to see some use cases where that modular reuse is required, because I think I don\'t have enough clear what code can be reuse in the environment definition.

2017-02-08T20:20:02 <michelled> Bosmon: can I nest a transform and use a string template here? https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-1596-pair/src/app.js#L233
2017-02-08T20:23:09 <Bosmon> michelled - in theory, yes, but this is a very poorly tested path
2017-02-08T20:23:33 <Bosmon> So far there haven\'t been any users of compound transforms in modelRelay
2017-02-08T20:24:16 <Bosmon> And there is just one test case for it
2017-02-08T20:24:17 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/DataBindingTests.js#L1187
2017-02-08T20:24:18 <michelled> Bosmon: is it better to leave it as is - a free transform?
2017-02-08T20:24:34 <Bosmon> michelled - yes, it\'s safer
2017-02-08T20:24:58 <michelled> cool - I\'ll be starting to write tests now - but other then that, I\'m ready for more laser eyes from you :)
2017-02-08T20:25:03 <Bosmon> That\'s great
2017-02-08T20:25:11 <Bosmon> Did you manage to collar that KASPARDNITT to get his branch working?

2017-02-08T15:21:50 <Bosmon> Welcome all to the first full release of a very important project - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpii-json-schema
2017-02-08T15:22:12 <Bosmon> And congratulations to the-t-in-rtf for his literally years of effort in polishing implementation, docs and test cases
2017-02-08T15:22:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Cheers, @Bosmon
2017-02-08T15:23:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I look forward to improving it further as people find uses in their own work.
2017-02-08T15:23:24 <Bosmon> For those of you in despair at what seem like endlessly running pull requests, you can note that this branch has been in review for FIFTEEN MONTHS :)
2017-02-08T15:23:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m just glad we don\'t have any older than my son.
2017-02-08T15:24:03 <Bosmon> "Sir. May I remind you that you have now been in that bath for OVER THREE YEARS?"
2017-02-08T15:30:34 <avtar> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: congrats on the 1.0.0 release :)
2017-02-08T15:30:36 <avtar> that\'s awesome
2017-02-08T15:31:48 <Bosmon> AND THAT\'S NOT ALL!
2017-02-08T15:31:50 <Bosmon> !!!!

2017-02-08T15:32:30 <Bosmon> I think I might start using this one virtually immediately
2017-02-08T15:32:50 <Bosmon> This one was only in review SIX MONTHS
2017-02-08T15:34:48 <avtar> ahh more awesomeness https://github.com/GPII/gpii-webdriver/blob/master/docs/accessibilty-checks.md
2017-02-08T15:38:28 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: awesome
2017-02-08T15:38:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I hope it\'s helpful.
2017-02-08T15:39:07 <Bosmon> Well, why not make it a hat-trick: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpii-handlebars
2017-02-08T15:39:12 <the-t-in-rtf> awesome!
2017-02-08T15:39:22 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf is the HERROE of the HHOUR!
2017-02-08T15:39:25 <Bosmon> Possibly of the entire year
2017-02-08T15:39:33 <the-t-in-rtf> my contributions page is finally going to flesh out a bit.
2017-02-08T15:39:42 <the-t-in-rtf> it looked pretty sparse for the second half of the year.
2017-02-08T15:40:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Glad the accessibility docs made it under the wire with gpii-webdriver.
2017-02-08T15:40:34 <Bosmon> A few hundred more commites than me now :)
2017-02-08T15:41:08 <alanharnum> I was looking at my closed PR number a few days ago
2017-02-08T15:41:09 <alanharnum> 117!
2017-02-08T15:41:14 <alanharnum> like a real open source developer
2017-02-08T15:41:23 <the-t-in-rtf> 152, apparently.
2017-02-08T15:41:40 <the-t-in-rtf> lots of them are like "push up the dependency versions", not sure how much the raw number means
2017-02-08T15:41:49 <alanharnum> IT MEANS EVERYTHING
2017-02-08T15:42:23 <alanharnum> i mean
2017-02-08T15:42:29 <alanharnum> i am sure other things count as well
2017-02-08T15:47:07 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: congratulations
2017-02-08T15:47:20 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: the bad news is that you have now three modules to maintain :P
2017-02-08T15:47:40 <gloob> you cannot escape

2017-02-08T15:55:53 <javjarfer> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf, congratulations!
2017-02-08T15:57:34 <the-t-in-rtf> @gloob, it doesn\'t change much, all of my work on the UL and PTD depends on those packages.
2017-02-08T15:57:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I couldn\'t get away from them if I tried.
2017-02-08T15:58:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I hope the release will mean more eyes to find bugs and heads full of ideas for improving them.
2017-02-08T15:58:20 <the-t-in-rtf> well, sense organs.
2017-02-08T15:59:12 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: haha, yes. Really awesome and that reminds me that we need to talk about UL and PTD soon! :D
2017-02-08T15:59:37 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: we are the consumers, I think.
2017-02-08T15:59:47 <gloob> Hi, I\'m a consumer
2017-02-08T15:59:50 <gloob> :D
2017-02-08T16:04:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: where do the tests for the functions in Fluid.js go?

2017-02-08T16:04:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for some reason i couldn\'t see that file.. i kept skipping over it when i was reading through the list :(

2017-02-08T16:22:49 <michelled> Bosmon: you suggested https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/1#pullrequestreview-20032420  that I pull out the configuration of the menu in the app into another grade. I assume the type of that grade would be \'gpii.app.menu\' I\'m not sure how I would refer to the app in that grade. For example: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-1596/src/app.js#L45
2017-02-08T16:25:43 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled
2017-02-08T16:25:48 <Bosmon> You can continue to refer to it as "{app}"
2017-02-08T16:25:52 <Bosmon> Or "{gpii.app}"
2017-02-08T16:26:13 <Bosmon> A few years ago we decided that these kinds of "incomplete grades" are a good and powerful thing : P
2017-02-08T16:28:20 <michelled> interesting - thanks
2017-02-08T16:28:54 <jessm> fluid-everyone: in the office \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps we should do standup in place?

2017-02-08T16:44:12 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - they should all be published so far
2017-02-08T16:44:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I was just working my way up the stack from the merged PRs and noticed that gpii-pouchdb does not appear to be published.
2017-02-08T16:44:30 <Bosmon> That\'s because it\'s not merged
2017-02-08T16:44:44 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, sorry missed that.
2017-02-08T16:44:50 <the-t-in-rtf> carry on....
2017-02-08T16:45:13 <the-t-in-rtf> In fairness, a green merge symbol in a sea of purple is relatively easy to miss.
2017-02-08T16:46:27 <Bosmon> in our yellow, submarine
2017-02-08T16:47:10 <the-t-in-rtf> merge of blue and merge of green
2017-02-08T16:47:29 <Bosmon> hahaha

2017-02-08T17:56:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: Could you please look at my PRs for FLUID-6125 which lets a user specify the number of decimal places in the numberToString transform. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/807 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/116
2017-02-08T17:57:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers, I will!
2017-02-08T17:57:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)

2017-02-08T18:10:56 <Bosmon> gloob, amatas, avtar et al - continuing from our chat just now in arch
2017-02-08T18:11:18 <Bosmon> It strikes me that another approach could involve the use of "raw npm tarball urls"
2017-02-08T18:11:38 <Bosmon> That is, to use the npm registry to store and version our modules, but to unpack them simply using tar -x
2017-02-08T18:11:50 <Bosmon> E.g. we have the following reference, https://registry.npmjs.org/kettle/-/kettle-1.3.2.tgz
2017-02-08T18:12:25 <Bosmon> Based on the form of the URL, we can know i) what version we have got, ii) how to publish and retrieve artefacts like this, iii) how to find out who is responsible, and under what licence etc
2017-02-08T18:12:25 <amatas> That could be an option, yes
2017-02-08T18:12:50 <Bosmon> Which are all things we would have to invent from scratch if we decided to make our own package/publication system, or adopt another one that might be portable
2017-02-08T18:13:07 <avtar> Bosmon: makes sense
2017-02-08T18:13:11 <Bosmon> The main limitation I see for bootstrapping is that we can\'t rely on tar being installed on a raw Windows box
2017-02-08T18:13:17 <Bosmon> BUt perhaps we can get to that state very easily somehow
2017-02-08T18:13:36 <avtar> github releases would work as well, those can be provided using zip files
2017-02-08T18:13:46 <Bosmon> ok, sure
2017-02-08T18:13:54 <gloob> that was my apprach, using name-major-minor.package
2017-02-08T18:13:59 <gloob> approach!
