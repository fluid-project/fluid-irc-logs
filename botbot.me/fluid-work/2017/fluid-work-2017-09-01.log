2017-09-01T16:12:19 <clown> a parody of Latin.

2017-09-01T16:22:56 <grrrero> Justin_o: I did
2017-09-01T16:23:33 <jhernandez> Bosmon: well, at least we always know how to pronounce it :P

2017-09-01T16:34:01 <Justin_o> grrrero: i wonder why that keeps happening
2017-09-01T16:34:14 <Justin_o> grrrero: do you have time today to walk me through the steps you did to merge
2017-09-01T16:34:33 <Justin_o> and if you don\'t have anything in github that you need to keep, you can force push "git push origin -f"
2017-09-01T16:36:10 <grrrero> Justin_o: Try now?
2017-09-01T16:38:05 <Justin_o> grrrero: that worked thanks,
2017-09-01T16:38:53 <Justin_o> grrrero: we should probably still chat today or next week about why you might be getting those  rejections from GitHub though. You shouldn\'t have to force push very often.
2017-09-01T16:39:19 <grrrero> Justin_o: Ok, something must be amiss in some config :\\

2017-09-01T17:00:02 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-01T17:00:15 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, I\'m already using it
2017-09-01T17:00:18 <jhernandez> it works
2017-09-01T17:00:27 <clown> ah, can\'t tell you anything.
2017-09-01T17:00:36 <clown> but \\o/
2017-09-01T17:00:36 <jhernandez> I\'m about to post an update to https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2084
2017-09-01T17:00:54 * clown clicks the link
2017-09-01T17:01:43 <clown> I remember that jira
2017-09-01T17:02:19 <Bosmon> Why does jhernandez say "there aren\'t plans to switch to edge.js soon" ?
2017-09-01T17:02:52 * clown awaits jhernandez response  *hums*
2017-09-01T17:02:57 <jhernandez> that update was made during our jira throughout
2017-09-01T17:03:38 <Bosmon> But clown\'s pull introducing edge.js has been under review since the BEGINNING OF TIME!
2017-09-01T17:03:45 <Bosmon> Surely you imagined it would get merged eventually? : P
2017-09-01T17:03:48 <jhernandez> and we all agree that moving to edge.js wasn\'t relevant/priority right now
2017-09-01T17:03:58 <jhernandez> hehe
2017-09-01T17:04:00 <jhernandez> sure
2017-09-01T17:04:00 <clown> beginning of time?  Man, I\'m old...
2017-09-01T17:04:05 <Bosmon> jhernandez - but WE HAVE DONE IT
2017-09-01T17:04:41 <jhernandez> and it\'s not a surprise, edge bundles its own version of node
2017-09-01T17:06:12 <jhernandez> in fact I made some tests with samples of edge and electron, and I was of course using matching versions of node
2017-09-01T17:06:32 <clown> we are currently using edge.js v6.5.1, but there are more recent versions (apropos of your comment on the jira).
2017-09-01T17:06:34 <jhernandez> but that was long time ago
2017-09-01T17:06:38 <jhernandez> Man, I\'m old ....
2017-09-01T17:06:40 <jhernandez> xDD
2017-09-01T17:06:43 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-09-01T17:06:46 <Bosmon> So do we have a problem now?
2017-09-01T17:06:52 <jhernandez> not a big one
2017-09-01T17:07:00 <Bosmon> Is it going to be possible to merge this into gpii-app and have it work?
2017-09-01T17:07:15 <jhernandez> as I posted on the jira, we can use electron-edge
2017-09-01T17:07:23 <Bosmon> Well sure
2017-09-01T17:07:25 <Bosmon> But does it work?
2017-09-01T17:07:28 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I already have it working!
2017-09-01T17:07:34 <Bosmon> ha
2017-09-01T17:07:35 <jhernandez> tests passing and system running
2017-09-01T17:07:43 <Bosmon> cool
2017-09-01T17:07:59 <Bosmon> But what do we do about the dependency declared by gpii-windows?
2017-09-01T17:08:14 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s the ugly thing
2017-09-01T17:09:05 <jhernandez> since we\'re running gpii-windows on both node and electron, we can\'t just replace the dep in gpii-windows
2017-09-01T17:09:10 <Bosmon> Sure
2017-09-01T17:09:12 <Bosmon> So what can we do?
2017-09-01T17:09:41 <clown> Have we confirmed that a later version of edge.js does not work with electron?
2017-09-01T17:09:54 <jhernandez> what I\'ve made so far is applying a fix on windows that loads electron-edge if we\'re on electron
2017-09-01T17:10:10 <Bosmon> jhernandez - how does the fix work?
2017-09-01T17:10:22 <jhernandez> and I added electron-edge as a dep of gpii-app
2017-09-01T17:12:05 <jhernandez> so the quick fix I made is as simple as requiring edge this way -> edge = process.versions.electron? require("electron-edge"): require("edge")
2017-09-01T17:13:22 <Bosmon> oh ok
2017-09-01T17:13:27 <jhernandez> it\'s true that we\'ll be shipping both edge and electron-edge, but right now this is the best thing I can think of
2017-09-01T17:13:55 <Bosmon> Well, let\'s see what our investigation of the process reporter performance problem shows
2017-09-01T17:14:02 <Bosmon> Perhaps we will have to end up getting rid of edge.js after all

2017-09-01T18:01:54 <Bosmon> Thanks, jhernandez
2017-09-01T18:02:44 <jhernandez> at least we have a workaround if we need to keep producing builds of gpii-app meanwhile we decide on edge

2017-09-01T20:00:32 <clown> thanks for the url, stegru
2017-09-01T20:01:22 <stegru> a fix might be: process.argv.lenth + process.execArgv.length

2017-09-01T20:12:54 <clown> but, your suggestion works
2017-09-01T20:13:43 <clown> I tested both "node processesBridge_tests.js" and "node debug processesBridge_tests.js", and it picked up the extra arg in second case.

2017-09-01T13:22:13 <Bosmon> Interestingly I think the native code isn\'t being invoked at all...
2017-09-01T13:23:50 <clown> Bosmon, the current windows master\'s package.json references "universal": "GPII/universal#8249ee1cff44f979f1cb71efee8d4a5ccc5fefd9".  Is that the one to use?
2017-09-01T13:24:05 <gloob> from yesterday :D
2017-09-01T13:24:24 <Bosmon> clown - the one to use is today\'s master with your pull in it
2017-09-01T13:24:43 <Bosmon> Otherwise I imagine your tests will not run : P

2017-09-01T13:31:23 <Bosmon> I have to say this C# reporter seems to be enormously slow
2017-09-01T13:31:29 <Bosmon> It took more than a minute to run the unit tests
2017-09-01T13:32:00 <Bosmon> I don\'t see any particularly slow operations in the impl
2017-09-01T13:32:05 <Bosmon> BUt I assume all the costs are in the "ManagementObjectSearcher"
2017-09-01T13:32:29 <clown> Bosmon, it is working now?
2017-09-01T13:32:50 <gloob> stegru: ok!
2017-09-01T13:36:02 <stegru> it could be slow because the c# gets compiled on the first run?
2017-09-01T13:36:13 <Bosmon> stegru - it\'s slow on every operation
2017-09-01T13:36:25 <stegru> oh ok

2017-09-01T13:37:14 <Bosmon> Takes about 3 seconds to list the processes each time
2017-09-01T13:37:17 <Bosmon> Even when it is given a pid
2017-09-01T13:37:36 <Bosmon> The fact that the overhead seems independent of the workload is interesting
2017-09-01T13:37:52 <Bosmon> Suggests that perhaps it really is trying to recompile the code each time
2017-09-01T13:38:09 <clown> Three seconds?  I knew it was slower than linux, but not that much slower.
2017-09-01T13:38:57 <gtirloni> Bosmon: are those separate invocations from the command line? that is, is the process starting from scratch every time? if so, it might be the .net vm startup time overhead
2017-09-01T13:39:24 <Bosmon> gtirloni, no, these are unit tests running against a component and function which should just be sitting in memory
2017-09-01T13:39:27 <clown> Ben (I think that what his name) suggested compiling the C# into a dll.  That might speed things up.
2017-09-01T13:40:17 <clown> gtirloni:  the node process is communicating using .net
2017-09-01T13:40:26 <clown> or communicating with .net

2017-09-01T15:20:31 <stegru> CI did, Bosmon
2017-09-01T15:20:37 <Bosmon> brilliant
2017-09-01T15:20:42 <Bosmon> I wonder why it didn\'t happen before
2017-09-01T15:21:22 <stegru> not sure.. but it looks like something was still happening from a previous test

2017-09-01T15:23:11 <Bosmon> alanharnum - at least on your 2nd time round
2017-09-01T15:23:20 <alanharnum> true that

2017-09-01T15:24:02 <Justin_o> grrrero: how did the testing of FLUID-5534 go
2017-09-01T15:24:35 <grrrero> Justin_o: All good \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc  successfully tested Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MS Edge, IE11
2017-09-01T15:24:45 <grrrero> Justin_o: Just working on that MS Edge bug now
2017-09-01T15:26:09 <ussjoin> gtirloni: We\'re just using GitHub at the moment, right, not GitLab? (I saw your email and got a bit confused.)
2017-09-01T15:26:34 <gtirloni> ussjoin: we\'re migrating from Jenkins to GitLab CI.. while keeping code in GitHub

2017-09-01T16:03:30 <stegru> corramos un tupido velo
2017-09-01T16:03:37 <jhernandez> btw, "no existente", is that a spanish translation of something? JFYI, depending on the context, you may use "no existente" or "inexistente"
2017-09-01T16:04:16 <clown> jhernandez, alanharnum said his spanish was non existent.  I asked, what is "non existent" in Spanish?
2017-09-01T16:04:31 <jhernandez> stegru: I see that you\'re improving your spanish ;)

2017-09-01T16:06:42 <jhernandez> clown: literally yes, it is translated like that, but we say "inexistente"
2017-09-01T16:07:09 <mrtyler> i feel like this is a continuation of the existentialism discussion from wednesday\'s meeting
2017-09-01T16:07:13 <jhernandez> in spanish, saying no existente sounds werid
2017-09-01T16:07:15 <mrtyler> only with spaniards instead of french ;)
2017-09-01T16:07:16 <jhernandez> hahaha

2017-09-01T16:09:20 <mrtyler> clown: is pig latin a Romance language? :hmm_emoji:
2017-09-01T16:09:54 <clown> mrtyler:  I would doubt it, since English isn\'t a Romance language.
2017-09-01T16:10:05 <clown> Or, for the existentialist:  is pig latin a language?

2017-09-01T09:07:20 <Bosmon> Let me know if I can look at any code for you
2017-09-01T09:24:41 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-09-01T09:30:45 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hi, Antranig! We experimented with creating dynamic components based on a source array and subsequently adding them to the DOM and it worked. Today we will probably examine the other approach for creating dynamic components (by using events).
2017-09-01T09:31:24 <georgitodorov> I don\'t think that there is any need for you to look at the code we have at the moment but we will let you know if we need any guidance on anything.
2017-09-01T09:31:45 <georgitodorov> And thank you very much for the comprehensive email from yesterday!
2017-09-01T09:33:13 <georgitodorov> We might need some clarification about how to consolidate all resource loading into a single component, because at least to me it wasn\'t quite clear from the example you linked
2017-09-01T09:46:39 * kasparnet has quit
2017-09-01T09:50:11 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - sure - I just mean to place all the templates you need loaded in this section: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/widgets/drop_down/src/widgets.js#L20
2017-09-01T09:50:20 <Bosmon> And then inject them downwards to any component which needs them
2017-09-01T09:53:52 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I see, thanks for the clarification

2017-09-01T10:21:32 <jhernandez> Bosmon: bonjour
2017-09-01T10:23:51 <jhernandez> I was about to build an installer out of gpii-app and I saw this commit (https://github.com/GPII/windows/commit/cd1c4af10e834f00bbec7d832cf231e527ef8aa9) from you in windows/hst-2017
2017-09-01T10:34:20 <stegru> jhernandez, are you making a new build for the pilots?
2017-09-01T10:34:27 <jhernandez> okay, forget about it, now I see the reason for that big diff
2017-09-01T10:34:53 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'m building an installer from what we have right now
2017-09-01T10:35:02 <jhernandez> why are you asking?
2017-09-01T10:35:21 <stegru> ok well, they want to have the windows metrics included
2017-09-01T10:35:47 <jhernandez> mmmm
2017-09-01T10:35:55 <jhernandez> that\'s not merged into master
2017-09-01T10:36:00 <jhernandez> right?
2017-09-01T10:36:26 <stegru> yeh, exactly - I don\'t know why, but they where expecting the metrics to be captured from it
2017-09-01T10:37:59 <stegru> i just assumed you put it in yourself
2017-09-01T10:41:43 <jhernandez> that I did include it into the build/installer? no
2017-09-01T10:42:09 <jhernandez> so yeah, we need to get it merged
2017-09-01T10:43:20 <jhernandez> I\'m seeing that the universal pull has received a lot of feedback fro, Bosmon
2017-09-01T10:43:55 <Bosmon> jhernandez - which one?
2017-09-01T10:44:03 <jhernandez> and that the windows side of this pull request has a conflict and that needs some serious review
2017-09-01T10:44:39 <jhernandez> Bosmon: we\'re talking about metrics capture
2017-09-01T10:44:43 <jhernandez> universal: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/515
2017-09-01T10:45:07 <jhernandez> windows: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/126
2017-09-01T10:47:03 * koo5 joined the channel
2017-09-01T10:47:19 <stegru> i should have checked it was in, instead of assuming
2017-09-01T10:47:36 <jhernandez> I can definitely do the actual testing of such feature, but would need indications about how can I actually test it (and see the metrics arriving into our system)
2017-09-01T10:48:06 <jhernandez> with the filebeat thing
2017-09-01T10:48:30 <stegru> well, as far as we\'re concerned as long as it writes to a file, then that\'s enough
2017-09-01T10:49:47 <stegru> there\'s an installer for filebeat, however
2017-09-01T10:50:28 <amatas> I\'d add a test on the deployment process of GPII to check that the communication between the clients (filebeat) and the cloud is working.
2017-09-01T10:53:17 <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, I do know it\'s just a file and that the filebeat thing has to do nothing with the pull request, but I\'d like to test all together
2017-09-01T10:53:47 <stegru> fill your boots
2017-09-01T10:54:25 <jhernandez> amatas: yeah, that makes sense - in fact we\'re already performing the network diagnosis (that ensures that there is connection with the INTERNET)
2017-09-01T10:58:17 <stegru> i\'m going to work on making gpii produce some build info, so in future we\'ll know what a particular build should and shouldn\'t do
2017-09-01T11:03:53 <jhernandez> stegru: how different is that from having a version? (and making it easy to check to the user)

2017-09-01T11:04:59 * kasparnet has quit
2017-09-01T11:05:02 <stegru> jhernandez: what does "GPII.170807.115353" mean?
2017-09-01T11:05:22 <jhernandez> creation time
2017-09-01T11:05:25 <jhernandez> it means nothihng
2017-09-01T11:05:39 <stegru> exactly
2017-09-01T11:06:47 <jhernandez> but hst_internal_testing_0.x means something in the context of "I\'m delivering this build that includes x and y"
2017-09-01T11:07:49 <stegru> what\'s the "x", and where does it come from?
2017-09-01T11:08:18 <jhernandez> each time I\'ve delivered a build like this, it comes with a list of things that are included
2017-09-01T11:08:23 <stegru> and where would you put "hst_internel_testing_0.x"?
2017-09-01T11:08:46 <jhernandez> these are the builds that we\'ve been using in get.gpii.net
2017-09-01T11:09:00 <jhernandez> let\'s say, "official builds"
2017-09-01T11:10:38 <stegru> well, i could install the current one from get.gpii.net, install an "unofficial" on, or even make one myself - I wouldn\'t be able to tell the difference between them
2017-09-01T11:10:53 <jhernandez> right
2017-09-01T11:10:56 <stegru> right
2017-09-01T11:12:56 <stegru> i mean, bern had been given an "unofficial" build, which had some feature and he was expecting that same feature to be in another build
2017-09-01T11:13:34 <stegru> until he tried that feature, he was unaware it wasn\'t in and thought it was a bug (or he did something wrong)
2017-09-01T11:14:38 <jhernandez> well, anytime we deliver an "unofficial build" we highlight why it is "unofficial"
2017-09-01T11:14:56 <jhernandez> ie: it includes dpi BUT this is not in master yet
2017-09-01T11:15:03 <jhernandez> why is that so confusing?
2017-09-01T11:15:41 <stegru> yes, but they might expect it to be in the official build given to them 2 months later, or something
2017-09-01T11:15:54 <jhernandez> and this is what happened
2017-09-01T11:18:05 <stegru> it\'s ok for you, you make the builds and know what\'s in it... but others (like me) don\'t unless you tell us and we don\'t forget

2017-09-01T11:41:45 <Bosmon> We should try to move to npm dev artefacts as quickly as we can
2017-09-01T11:46:02 <stegru> is that put the modules in their own npm package?
2017-09-01T11:49:15 <Bosmon> Well, just the ones we have already
2017-09-01T11:49:22 <Bosmon> i.e. universal, windows, linux
2017-09-01T11:49:37 <Bosmon> We won\'t go for "nutty modularisation" just yet
2017-09-01T11:50:03 <Bosmon> stegru - I\'ve just merged your https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/515 - I\'ll try to get to klown\'s process stuff as soon as I can
2017-09-01T11:51:18 <stegru> great. there\'s also https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/126
2017-09-01T11:51:48 <stegru> the only issue was duplicating klown\'s process related things, but i\'ll be sorting that out when his is eventually in
2017-09-01T11:51:54 <Bosmon> Yes

2017-09-01T13:15:18 <Bosmon> clown - ok, sadly I am getting a lot of test failures pointing your windows pull at current master
2017-09-01T13:15:23 <Bosmon> So do try updating it and see what CI says
2017-09-01T13:15:57 <clown> Bosmon, will do.  Are the errors in unit tests, or acceptance tests.
2017-09-01T13:15:58 <clown> ?
2017-09-01T13:16:18 <Bosmon> Unit tests
2017-09-01T13:16:25 <Bosmon> I\'ll paste my transcript to the pull
2017-09-01T13:16:43 <clown> Bosmon, that would be helpful.
