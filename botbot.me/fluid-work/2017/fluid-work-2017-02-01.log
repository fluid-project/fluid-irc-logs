2017-02-01T15:51:26 <colinclark> Justin_o: Where does one go to learn about the different modes for integrating UIO, including the lazy loading feature?
2017-02-01T15:52:19 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2017-02-01T15:52:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: the API docs http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UserInterfaceOptionsAPI.html
2017-02-01T15:52:48 <Justin_o> and the tutorial http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-userInterfaceOptions/UserInterfaceOptions.html
2017-02-01T15:53:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: jhung is also in the process of porting over some additional UIO related docs as well
2017-02-01T15:54:40 <jhung> colinclark: The docs I\'m porting over relate to making markup and CSS changes to make UIO work better on sites.
2017-02-01T15:55:35 <jhung> as well, I created a doc on the Wiki about installing and using UI Options which is intended to be less technical. https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Installing+and+Getting+Started+with+UI+Options
2017-02-01T15:55:54 <jhung> ^ that one will eventually make its way to the docs site
2017-02-01T15:56:04 <colinclark> awesome!
2017-02-01T15:56:06 <simonjb> hey Bosmon: thanks for updating some of the line lengths in your PR -- some of the lines are still over 120 chars -- I\'m not sure how important this is right now -- the changes look good to me other than the minor comments I made
2017-02-01T15:56:16 <colinclark> jhung: you rule!
2017-02-01T15:56:22 <colinclark> you too, Justin_o
2017-02-01T15:56:34 <Justin_o> :)

2017-02-01T15:57:00 <Justin_o> did that show up?
2017-02-01T15:57:26 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-02-01T16:11:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - do you see the lines as too long in the github interface still?
2017-02-01T16:13:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: yeah such as https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/cc77cf94c06a34d5ff91b48804fa2aefd9e7b2e0/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L431
2017-02-01T16:14:06 <simonjb> but I don\'t want to waste a lot of energy on this as we don\'t have a policy
2017-02-01T16:14:24 <simonjb> and using the GitHub split diff works ok
2017-02-01T16:14:33 <simonjb> maybe something to chat about at the arch meeting
2017-02-01T16:14:55 <simonjb> Bosmon: ^
2017-02-01T16:15:05 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s interesting, I can see all of that line in that view
2017-02-01T16:15:11 <Bosmon> Perhaps they have some kind of "responsive CSS" ....
2017-02-01T16:15:40 <Bosmon> Although it doesn\'t seem to change if I make the window narrower
2017-02-01T16:16:11 <Bosmon> It also doesn\'t change if I zoom the browser
2017-02-01T16:16:12 <Bosmon> Odd
2017-02-01T16:16:22 <Bosmon> simonjb - what\'s the last character you can see on that line?
2017-02-01T16:16:23 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, I can see all in that view also, if my window is wide enough; but that line in the diff is cut off https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/497/commits/cc77cf94c06a34d5ff91b48804fa2aefd9e7b2e0
2017-02-01T16:16:35 <simonjb> line 431
2017-02-01T16:16:57 <Bosmon> simonjb - I see all of line 431 in that view too
2017-02-01T16:17:05 <simonjb> ah, interesting
2017-02-01T16:17:28 <Bosmon> Do you not see as far as the word "fullSnapshot" at the end of the line?
2017-02-01T16:17:28 <simonjb> I get cut off at "(when the ful"
2017-02-01T16:17:34 <Bosmon> Ah, interesting
2017-02-01T16:17:36 <Bosmon> I wonder why
2017-02-01T16:17:53 <simonjb> what browser?
2017-02-01T16:17:56 <simonjb> I\'m in FF
2017-02-01T16:17:57 <Bosmon> Chrome
2017-02-01T16:18:00 <simonjb> will try Chrome
2017-02-01T16:18:24 <Bosmon> will try FF :)
2017-02-01T16:18:38 <Bosmon> simonjb - looks ok for me in FF too
2017-02-01T16:18:49 <simonjb> hmm
2017-02-01T16:18:50 <Bosmon> I can see "fullSnapshot" there too
2017-02-01T16:18:59 <simonjb> cut off for me in Chrome
2017-02-01T16:19:11 <simonjb> "when the f
2017-02-01T16:19:15 <simonjb> "
2017-02-01T16:19:26 <simonjb> font settings maybe?
2017-02-01T16:19:48 <simonjb> I have plenty of whitespace on either side of the diff view
2017-02-01T16:19:59 <Bosmon> Yes, me too
2017-02-01T16:20:01 <simonjb> are you using unified diff rather than split?
2017-02-01T16:20:14 <Bosmon> unified
2017-02-01T16:20:17 <simonjb> weird
2017-02-01T16:20:32 <simonjb> page zoom doesn\'t seem to make a difference
2017-02-01T16:20:40 <Bosmon> In split I see the line too, but it wraps
2017-02-01T16:20:45 <simonjb> me too
2017-02-01T16:20:53 <simonjb> split is fine as it wraps
2017-02-01T16:21:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-02-01T16:23:02 <simonjb> ah, page zoom does make a difference
2017-02-01T16:23:41 <simonjb> but inconsistently -- if I zoom down I see more of the line, then zoom down some more and see more, then zoom down some more and see less
2017-02-01T16:29:18 <simonjb> Bosmon: ah, looks like the diff view width is set in pixels: 980px
2017-02-01T16:29:32 <simonjb> so, it will depend on font size
2017-02-01T16:29:34 <Bosmon> ha
2017-02-01T16:29:43 <simonjb> boo
2017-02-01T16:30:48 <simonjb> it was just by change 120 chars on my browser and I thought as 120 is a standard width, that it was maybe set to that
2017-02-01T16:31:20 <simonjb> but it will depend on font specifics how many chars will fit into 980px
2017-02-01T16:32:13 <simonjb> or maybe they set the font in the view to be approx 120 chars but individual browser configs are not going to be the same
