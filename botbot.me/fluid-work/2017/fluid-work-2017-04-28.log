2017-04-28T13:19:00 <cindyli> hi the-t-in-rtf, i guess you missed my message yesterday. I\'m having an issue with using the latest gpii-pouchdb with an universal pull request and wondering if you have any ideas - https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2017-04-27/?msg=84808701&page=1

2017-04-28T14:31:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, Cindy.  I was off then (and am off now)
2017-04-28T14:32:05 <the-t-in-rtf> If you can summarize somewhere I can see it, like an existing PR or an email, I can take a look when I\'m back at work.
2017-04-28T14:32:22 <the-t-in-rtf> we can also probably meet for at least a few minutes on Monday, depending on when you get in.
2017-04-28T14:32:31 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli ^^^
2017-04-28T14:33:00 <cindyli> sounds great. sending you an email. thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2017-04-28T14:33:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Just to be sure, you should probably be using: 1.0.2-dev.20170428T084916Z.058ac5a
2017-04-28T14:33:51 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s the latest version Antranig and I are reviewing and it has some cleanup improvements.
2017-04-28T14:34:12 <the-t-in-rtf> If that doesn\'t help, then email is a good next step.
2017-04-28T14:34:17 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli ^^^
2017-04-28T14:34:40 <cindyli> ah ha. thanks for letting me know. will try it
2017-04-28T14:34:48 <cindyli> was using 1.0.1
2017-04-28T14:35:32 <the-t-in-rtf> The latest PR to add a timeout for universal revealed some problems that might also affect you around the default location of log files.
2017-04-28T14:35:59 <the-t-in-rtf> You can read through the thread, but here\'s a summary of the latest fix: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/pull/14#issuecomment-297941092
2017-04-28T14:38:12 <cindyli> got it
2017-04-28T14:39:10 <cindyli> thanks for sparing time to answer my question, the-t-in-rtf. enjoy the weekend

2017-04-28T14:43:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I did eventually remember to contact her.

2017-04-28T17:36:54 <colinclark> Bosmon or javjarfer, do you have time for a quick question?
2017-04-28T17:37:03 <Bosmon> Hi there colinclark
2017-04-28T17:37:18 <colinclark> I just got an interesting question from Bern about what the GPII "knows"
2017-04-28T17:37:24 <colinclark> And I wanted to confirm an assumption I had made
2017-04-28T17:37:34 <colinclark> So he wondered if the GPII knows when it is "done"
2017-04-28T17:37:52 <colinclark> and I said that it certainly knows when it is done everything IT needs to do
2017-04-28T17:37:54 <colinclark> such as stopping applications, setting settings, and starting applications
2017-04-28T17:38:11 <colinclark> but I also assumed that it had no way to know, for example, if an application itself was "done"\xe2\x80\x94i.e. fully loaded and initialized
2017-04-28T17:38:20 <Bosmon> Not necessarily for starting applications, sadly
2017-04-28T17:38:26 <Bosmon> This depends on some upcoming work by kaspardniet
2017-04-28T17:38:33 <colinclark> how could it ever know this?
2017-04-28T17:38:43 <colinclark> I mean, let\'s say launch an application takes 30 seconds
2017-04-28T17:38:49 <Bosmon> Well, it could know more than it does now :)
2017-04-28T17:38:53 <colinclark> aha
2017-04-28T17:38:53 <Bosmon> Which is exactly nothing
2017-04-28T17:38:55 <colinclark> what would it know?
2017-04-28T17:39:00 <colinclark> what could it know, I guess is the question?
2017-04-28T17:39:07 <Bosmon> It would know, for example, that the process had actually started
2017-04-28T17:39:12 <colinclark> aha
2017-04-28T17:39:20 <colinclark> but currently it is "fire and forget?"
2017-04-28T17:39:22 <Bosmon> And yes, I imagine javjarfer\'s upcoming work might be our key to knowing more
2017-04-28T17:39:28 <Bosmon> Yes
2017-04-28T17:39:41 <colinclark> i.e. it\'s "done" when it has executed the command that should have resulted in the process being started
2017-04-28T17:39:44 <colinclark> is that correct?
2017-04-28T17:41:30 <Bosmon> Yes, that\'s right
2017-04-28T17:41:39 <colinclark> thank you very much, Bosmon
2017-04-28T17:43:01 <Bosmon> no worries, colinclark
2017-04-28T17:49:26 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled - how much of your gpii-app work is in the HST branch?
2017-04-28T17:49:46 <Bosmon> I was wondering in general where the test executables that kavya etc. are testing work are built from?
2017-04-28T17:51:15 <michelled> most of it Bosmon
2017-04-28T17:51:19 <michelled> well, actually, all of it
2017-04-28T17:51:31 <michelled> only the tests I\'m working on  - in a different branch - aren\'t in yet
2017-04-28T17:51:46 <michelled> it should all be built from the HST branch
2017-04-28T17:52:00 <michelled> and we decided that we would work that branch into a form that could go into master
2017-04-28T17:53:19 <michelled> which was just making the logging optional - perhaps only in a particular mode? and secondly kasper mentioned that some of the provisioning scripts needed to be removed
2017-04-28T17:55:59 * sgithens joined the channel
2017-04-28T17:56:04 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-04-28T17:57:49 <Bosmon> Would you be able to review my pull request https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/12 ?
2017-04-28T17:57:56 <Bosmon> For some reason the CI build has failed for it ....
2017-04-28T17:58:25 <Bosmon> But maybe they always do for gpii-app?
2017-04-28T18:00:49 <michelled> I\'m not sure about that
2017-04-28T18:01:17 <michelled> amatas: where do I look to see all the CI builds for gpii-app?
2017-04-28T18:03:15 <michelled> looks like I found it: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/

2017-04-28T18:29:33 <Bosmon> michelled, amatas - so how do we know what branch it builds from?
2017-04-28T18:29:42 <Bosmon> I mean, I guess this just runs CI on every pull request
2017-04-28T18:29:46 <Bosmon> But what are testers using?
2017-04-28T18:30:28 <michelled> javjarfer: am I right that the HST-2017 branch is what testers are using?
2017-04-28T18:33:50 * javjarfer_ joined the channel
2017-04-28T18:34:52 <Bosmon> javjarfer_ ^
2017-04-28T18:36:05 <javjarfer_> Yes, afaik that is the branch they are actually using
2017-04-28T18:36:20 <javjarfer_> sorry michelled .
2017-04-28T18:39:45 <javjarfer_> Bosmon, replaying to the question before, I hope that we could have event based application start discovery, based on windows events, we also talked about the general process start discovery, but that was future work
2017-04-28T18:40:38 <javjarfer_> I think we have a document with the impl problems that it could potentially have, and that probably we will need to address it in the future
2017-04-28T18:44:13 <Bosmon> Yes - as per colinclark\'s question earlier, I think we may well run into situations where the app has fired a message signifying it is ready, but the UI is not actually yet usable
2017-04-28T18:44:29 <Bosmon> So this may be a case in which a UIA-based approach could let us offer a better quality of implementation
2017-04-28T18:45:11 <javjarfer_> yes, maybe a mixed approach will be the best for covering all possible situations
2017-04-28T18:46:27 <javjarfer_> sometimes the start of a process doesn\'t also mean that the UI is ready for interaction, so we will probably need to take both into account

2017-04-28T19:06:47 <amatas> Bosmon, michelled: if you go at the bottom of the comments of each PR, there is a report of the "checks", if you unfold that part you will see all the jenkins jobs triggered and a link to the details (console output)  of the job
2017-04-28T19:09:04 <amatas> also each job, at the details of each job there is a message like "GitHub pull request #12 of ...", where you can find the PR number. For example: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-tests/37/
