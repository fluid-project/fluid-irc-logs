2017-01-26T17:33:47 <michelled> :)
2017-01-26T17:33:58 <michelled> I think he already merged my branch to his
2017-01-26T17:34:05 <michelled> so it should be seemless
2017-01-26T17:34:22 <gloob> yes, you are right he is behind you
2017-01-26T17:34:24 <gloob> perfect, then

2017-01-26T21:14:37 <simonjb> hey cindyli
2017-01-26T21:14:48 <cindyli> hi simonjb
2017-01-26T21:15:00 <simonjb> I read over your notes on "Dedicated process running as a different user for storing/retrieving client id/secret"
2017-01-26T21:15:22 <simonjb> I think the tricky part there (as you say) is to secure the communication between the 2 processes
2017-01-26T21:15:51 <cindyli> you mean to have the 2nd process sprawn the first one as a child thread?
2017-01-26T21:16:23 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, if that was possible
2017-01-26T21:17:32 <cindyli> searching\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-01-26T21:18:23 <simonjb> could you maybe expand on "By reading the source code, attackers can figure out: the user credentials (id and password) used for creating the 2nd process"?
2017-01-26T21:20:41 <simonjb> cindyli: ^
2017-01-26T21:26:07 <cindyli> simonjb: when gpii starts, it starts the 2nd process as a different user than the login user, (i should give more referable names to these 2 processes), then the 2nd process starts the first process, and the first process runs as the login user. in order to start the 2nd process, i think the gpii code needs to keep the credential of that different user
2017-01-26T21:26:58 <cindyli> or gpii provides a GUI for the login user to give credentials of that different user, which i think is not a good option
2017-01-26T21:27:51 <simonjb> cindyli: the 2nd process (this is the \'privileged\' one, right?) could be started as a service at machine boot
2017-01-26T21:28:02 <simonjb> so it\'s always runnning
2017-01-26T21:29:37 <cindyli> i see what you mean. btw, \'privileged\' is a good name
2017-01-26T21:30:21 <simonjb> an administrator could set it up at GPII install time and the regular user wouldn\'t need the privileged user credentials
2017-01-26T21:31:45 <simonjb> cindyli: do we know if it\'s possible for a process running as another user to start a process for the current desktop user?
2017-01-26T21:32:08 <simonjb> and to have access to the desktop?
2017-01-26T21:33:38 <cindyli> i don\'t know. searching..
2017-01-26T21:34:03 <simonjb> or...
2017-01-26T21:34:15 <cindyli> simonjb: why does this process need to have access to the desktop?
2017-01-26T21:34:35 <simonjb> we don\'t necessarily need the privileged user to start the regular process
2017-01-26T21:35:15 <simonjb> cindyli: I think we have an electron app that michelled is working on that has a user-facing ui, right?
2017-01-26T21:36:07 <simonjb> cindyli: we need some mechanism by which the privileged process will only accept requests from authorized GPII user processes
2017-01-26T21:36:32 <simonjb> having the privileged process start the user process is one way
2017-01-26T21:37:14 <simonjb> another would be to have the user process run with permissions different from the regular user
2017-01-26T21:37:50 <simonjb> Unix has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid
2017-01-26T21:37:58 <simonjb> Windows maybe has something similar
2017-01-26T21:38:17 <simonjb> though this is maybe starting to get a little too complicated
2017-01-26T21:38:36 <cindyli> so we have 3 users here
2017-01-26T21:38:43 <simonjb> but if we keep thinking through it a simpler solution will appear
2017-01-26T21:38:56 <simonjb> maybe appear
2017-01-26T21:40:03 <cindyli> also if the privileged process runs as a service, might be a concern that it could be disabled or stopped by random ppl
2017-01-26T21:40:59 * Jess__ joined the channel
2017-01-26T21:41:08 <simonjb> I keep thinking that there must be some good solution here that is just escaping us
2017-01-26T21:42:23 <simonjb> we want something that is readable by the GPII process but not by the user running the process
2017-01-26T21:42:59 <simonjb> on unix setgid would do that
2017-01-26T21:43:26 <simonjb> we would have a file that is readable by a group that the user isn\'t part of
2017-01-26T21:43:58 <simonjb> but the executable has setgid set so that it gets that group access when run
2017-01-26T21:44:10 <cindyli> but when we apply setting to user\'s machine, we will need to act on behalf of the user
2017-01-26T21:48:44 * stegru has quit
2017-01-26T21:49:11 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, and setgid would allow that
2017-01-26T21:49:21 <simonjb> it would change the group of the process but not the user
2017-01-26T21:49:41 <simonjb> but in quick research, I don\'t think Windows has an equivalent
2017-01-26T21:50:02 <cindyli> :(
2017-01-26T21:57:42 <simonjb> cindyli: but maybe there is a different windows capabilities model where a process can have permissions different from the user starting it?
2017-01-26T21:57:58 <simonjb> my knowledge here is limited

2017-01-26T22:01:02 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-01-26T22:02:01 <colinclark> simonjb: So here\'s the thing, right
2017-01-26T22:02:04 <colinclark> https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-AudioNode-connect-AudioNode-AudioNode-destination-unsigned-long-output-unsigned-long-input
2017-01-26T22:02:17 * stegru joined the channel
2017-01-26T22:02:32 <colinclark> The Node.connect() method provides default argument values for the latter two arguments\xe2\x80\x94the input and output number
2017-01-26T22:02:47 <colinclark> so they will always default to the first input/output if either of these arguments are omitted
2017-01-26T22:02:59 <simonjb> ah
2017-01-26T22:03:04 <colinclark> so I suppose that\'s probably a semantic we can/should preserve?
2017-01-26T22:03:07 <colinclark> I mean, we certainly can
2017-01-26T22:03:10 <colinclark> but should we?
2017-01-26T22:03:52 <simonjb> good question
2017-01-26T22:04:03 <simonjb> it\'s maybe reasonable to preserve
2017-01-26T22:04:49 <simonjb> particularly if we want to provide familiarity to Web Audio API devs
2017-01-26T22:04:55 <colinclark> I mean, I think a reasonable goal for a format like this is to be as explicit and regular as possible
2017-01-26T22:05:12 <colinclark> and one doesn\'t imagine actually coding in this format for (hopefully) very long
2017-01-26T22:05:25 * kasparnet has quit
2017-01-26T22:05:43 <simonjb> I would also think that\'s a reasonable position to take
2017-01-26T22:05:50 <simonjb> (I\'m not really helping)
2017-01-26T22:06:44 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-26T22:06:46 <colinclark> it\'s fine
2017-01-26T22:06:54 <simonjb> explicit and regular is attractive
2017-01-26T22:07:14 <colinclark> so is precisely harmonized with the web audio api :)
2017-01-26T22:07:38 <colinclark> I suppose in absence of a clear motivation to the contrary, the former is probably better
2017-01-26T22:07:46 <colinclark> I have learned this lesson a few times in Flocking :(
2017-01-26T22:07:46 <simonjb> but I also see some value in reducing text for common cases
2017-01-26T22:08:09 <colinclark> yes
2017-01-26T22:08:17 <colinclark> I suppose at least I could remove the intermediate path
2017-01-26T22:08:24 <simonjb> there is some added complexity but if it\'s applied uniformly and is straightforward it\'s easy to learn
2017-01-26T22:08:34 <colinclark> yes
2017-01-26T22:09:10 * Tabs16 has quit
2017-01-26T22:09:25 <simonjb> it does reduce the amount of reading and writing and is understandable provided you know the shorthand rule
2017-01-26T22:09:37 <simonjb> but you do have to know it
2017-01-26T22:09:47 <simonjb> or be able to guess it
2017-01-26T22:11:02 <simonjb> but if this is really a lower level generated notation, explicit is maybe better :)
2017-01-26T22:11:38 <simonjb> though people will definitely use it directly if it exists (I think)

2017-01-26T16:58:02 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i wonder why they have different instructions for google employees
2017-01-26T16:58:30 <alanharnum> Justin_o: internal tooling, I expect
2017-01-26T16:58:52 <alanharnum> proprietary build libraries or similar
2017-01-26T16:59:50 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that makes sense
2017-01-26T17:01:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have a model relay question, if you have a model relay setup between two components A and B.. and B tries to sent a change that A rejects. Is there away to get A to reset the model value in B
2017-01-26T17:05:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there\'s no way to reject changes in the current relay idiom
2017-01-26T17:05:25 <Bosmon> That idiom was abolished in the rewrite we had around 2011

2017-01-26T17:08:45 <Bosmon> I guess we refer to that as the update "being transformed away"
2017-01-26T17:09:04 <Bosmon> The only updates that you might apply are the ones that occur in the transforms
2017-01-26T17:09:15 <Bosmon> So if you want A to produce a different value, you\'ll need to write a transform that produces that value
2017-01-26T17:09:40 * kasparnet has quit
2017-01-26T17:09:48 <Bosmon> In this case it might be something like a "fluid.transforms.filterToRange" that leaves values unchanged if they don\'t lie within a particular range
2017-01-26T17:10:16 <Bosmon> Well, I guess there\'s a problem here in that you want the "old value" before the change started
2017-01-26T17:10:25 <Bosmon> There\'s no clear way to access those using the modelRelay idiom
2017-01-26T17:10:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is for my refactoring work of the textfield slider as we move to implementing the new stepper.
2017-01-26T17:10:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how does the "new stepper" work?
2017-01-26T17:10:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: essentially the same, but uses buttons to increment and deferment instead of having a slider
2017-01-26T17:11:08 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-01-26T17:11:15 <Bosmon> And what\'s the requirement for the new range behaviour?
2017-01-26T17:11:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what i want though is to have all the range limiting done in a single place
2017-01-26T17:11:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, well it should be
2017-01-26T17:11:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: same as before, but i want to simplify
2017-01-26T17:12:01 <Bosmon> So I guess I\'m not clear what you meant by "get A to reset the model value in B"
2017-01-26T17:12:16 <Bosmon> After the action of limitRange, both components will agree on the final value
2017-01-26T17:12:28 <Bosmon> Which will be one at the limit of the range, if there was such a transforming relay
2017-01-26T17:12:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so lets say someone enters a string or a value that is out of range, i want the textfield to be put back to a valid entry
2017-01-26T17:12:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it will be
2017-01-26T17:12:47 <Bosmon> Assuming that the relay is bidirectional
2017-01-26T17:12:49 <Bosmon> Which it should be
2017-01-26T17:12:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh awesome,
2017-01-26T17:13:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well one other difference is that the designs for the stepper include a unit
2017-01-26T17:13:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, well it seems that there is a bug
2017-01-26T17:13:47 <Bosmon> The person who wrote fluid.transforms.limitRange seems to have forgotten to write the inverse rule for it
2017-01-26T17:13:48 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L603
2017-01-26T17:13:50 <Justin_o> but that may just be styling, not sure yet..
2017-01-26T17:13:53 <Justin_o> oh what\'s the bug
2017-01-26T17:13:54 <Bosmon> THis should be raised and fixed as a separate JIRA
2017-01-26T17:14:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  :(
2017-01-26T17:14:04 <Justin_o> okay
2017-01-26T17:14:16 <Justin_o> how would you inverse that though?
2017-01-26T17:14:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just like this one: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L93
2017-01-26T17:14:33 <Bosmon> The definition of fluid.transforms.round is correct
2017-01-26T17:14:43 <Bosmon> And shows how the definition of fluid.transforms.limitRange should have been written
2017-01-26T17:15:24 <Bosmon> If we had a suitably enterprising GSoC student, this would be a lovely two-line issue for them
2017-01-26T17:15:34 <Bosmon> If this wasn\'t something that we probably need fixed pretty quickly : P
2017-01-26T17:15:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah.. too bad
2017-01-26T17:15:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the inverse is to just return the current model value?
2017-01-26T17:16:12 <Justin_o> that is to say, the limited value
2017-01-26T17:16:56 <Bosmon> yes
2017-01-26T17:18:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also what exactly is this doing https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L36-L39
2017-01-26T17:18:59 <Justin_o> i\'m confused because there is an assignment followed by the grade definition that uses the assigned value as a grade
2017-01-26T17:19:10 * Tabs16 has quit
2017-01-26T17:19:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, if you file the JIRA i can quickly work on it
2017-01-26T17:20:20 <Justin_o> unless you already have the change implemented, in which case I could review it
2017-01-26T17:31:11 * kasparne_ has quit
2017-01-26T17:31:37 <gloob> arghhhhhh
2017-01-26T17:31:38 <gloob> almost
2017-01-26T17:32:25 <gloob> michelled: you around? I wanted to ask to kasper, do you know if he have planned to merge his changes back to your branch?
2017-01-26T17:33:04 <michelled> hi gloob - he did make a pull request to my branch, but I think he\'s still working out some details
2017-01-26T17:33:23 <michelled> also, he was depending on a windows pull he made - do you know if that got in?
