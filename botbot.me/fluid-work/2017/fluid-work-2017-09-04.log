2017-09-04T11:49:12 <kasparne_> stegru: ping
2017-09-04T11:49:22 <stegru> hello
2017-09-04T11:49:26 <kasparne_> hey stegru
2017-09-04T11:49:39 <kasparne_> I\'m looking at some acceptance tests for the windows repo in my MM branch
2017-09-04T11:49:48 <stegru> ok
2017-09-04T11:50:04 <kasparne_> and am looking at the filterkeys solutions registry entry
2017-09-04T11:50:52 <kasparne_> and just wanted to double check that it is correct that if either debounce or slowkeys are enabled (true), filterkeys will be false
2017-09-04T11:52:26 <kasparne_> (for some reason my acceptance tests are expecting something different, and I wanted to check that it was when writing them I screwed up)
2017-09-04T11:52:47 <stegru> slow keys and bounce keys can\'t both be enabled
2017-09-04T11:53:13 <stegru> i don\'t think that affects filter keys
2017-09-04T11:53:53 <stegru> wait, "filter keys" is slow keys
2017-09-04T11:55:20 <stegru> GPII-81
2017-09-04T11:55:28 <stegru> "lowKeys and BounceKeys are mutually exclusive and I\'ve been unable to work around it. So, if both are set then SlowKeys will take priority."
2017-09-04T11:56:23 <kasparne_> ah, awesome!!!
2017-09-04T11:56:30 <kasparne_> Thanks for clarifying, stegru
2017-09-04T11:56:36 <stegru> that\'s ok
2017-09-04T11:56:55 <stegru> i think "filter keys" is "slow keys / bounce keys"
2017-09-04T12:07:48 <Bosmon> Hey jhernandez - great pull on the renaming!
2017-09-04T12:08:08 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey, thanks!
2017-09-04T12:10:17 <jhernandez> btw, is there any place where the fluid-publish process we follow for infusion is described?
2017-09-04T12:26:28 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-09-04T14:03:54 <Bosmon> jhernandez - only in its own docs
2017-09-04T14:04:32 <Bosmon> It\'s pretty simple.... you just npm install -g it, and then from any project which is a clean checkout you can run fluid-publish

2017-09-04T15:42:15 <Bosmon> Do you have some kind of github batch interface? : P
2017-09-04T15:43:11 <jhernandez> Bosmon: stegru uses gitbatch
2017-09-04T15:43:14 <stegru> heh no i just click \'comment\' in a batch
