b'2017-04-26T15:15:42 <Bosmon> Thanks so much simonjb - super-helpful comments!
2017-04-26T15:15:47 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, yes.  I mentioned it long ago in one of our meetings, so long ago that I only remembered I needed to do it myself this morning\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2017-04-26T15:16:03 <the-t-in-rtf> _users is also a good idea
2017-04-26T15:16:18 <Bosmon> alanharnum, colinclark - this is a super-magnificent video
2017-04-26T15:16:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Unless you tear out the auth portions of express-pouchdb, that\'ll also get created.
2017-04-26T15:16:25 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: something like - _users: {}
2017-04-26T15:16:29 <the-t-in-rtf> yup.
2017-04-26T15:16:37 <cindyli> cool. thanks, the-t-in-rtf. trying out..
2017-04-26T15:18:09 <colinclark> thanks, Bosmon

2017-04-26T15:54:49 <colinclark> Caren, jhung: would 2 pm tomorrow work to talk about the create-a-thon?
2017-04-26T15:55:04 <colinclark> i hope i will still be conscious by then :)
2017-04-26T15:55:11 <colinclark> I still don\'t know if they will need me at 3 am at the review or not
2017-04-26T15:55:59 * gtirloni_ is now known as gtirloni
2017-04-26T15:59:12 <Caren> colinclark: I can work around your schedule, no problem. we will keep it short and sweet. Hopefully it won\xe2\x80\x99t be too mind bending :-)
2017-04-26T16:00:01 <colinclark> :)
2017-04-26T16:00:18 <colinclark> I like mind bending discussions

2017-04-26T17:09:28 <Bosmon> colinclark - where can I read about the "create-a-thon"?
2017-04-26T17:09:55 <colinclark> Bosmon: In the wiki, I assume. But jhung or Caren can probably point you to the right place.

2017-04-26T17:15:42 <jhung> Bosmon: I can pass you a link...

2017-04-26T17:17:10 <Bosmon> Wow, great - thanks jhung!
2017-04-26T17:17:29 <jhung> There\'s a link to a Google Doc in that wiki which contains more information but has some confidential info Bosmon.
2017-04-26T17:19:07 <Caren> Hi Bosmon: here\xe2\x80\x99s the link https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Energy+Skate+Park+co-design I\xe2\x80\x99m updating as we speak.
2017-04-26T17:19:46 <Bosmon> Thanks Caren - looks really interesting

2017-04-26T18:22:29 <jhung> colinclark: how soon do you need the data re: phet? Emily can get stats from older sets sooner, but more recent data will take a little longer
2017-04-26T18:22:38 <colinclark> older is fine
2017-04-26T18:22:53 <colinclark> I need the stats soon if possible
2017-04-26T18:23:14 <jhung> When do you need it by colinclark?
2017-04-26T18:23:31 <colinclark> Well, it\'s about 8:30 pm in Europe now
2017-04-26T18:23:39 <colinclark> Gianna wants to add these numbers to her slides
2017-04-26T18:23:47 <colinclark> the review is tomorrow morning in Europe
2017-04-26T18:23:55 <colinclark> so ideally in the next couple of hours
2017-04-26T18:24:05 <colinclark> so that Gianna has time tonight or early tomorrow morning to update her slides
2017-04-26T18:24:21 <colinclark> I don\'t want to to put pressure on Emily\xe2\x80\x94just some ballpark figures is fine
2017-04-26T18:25:14 <colinclark> alanharnum: If you could suggest a 2 minute section of your FLOE video that is most crucial, what time range would it be?
2017-04-26T18:25:21 <colinclark> it seems that they may want to show a portion of it at the review tomorrow
2017-04-26T18:25:40 <jhung> ok
2017-04-26T18:25:43 <colinclark> thanks jhung
2017-04-26T18:26:53 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: at today\'s community meeting kathy_ and grace will be showing the Inclusive Design OER that they\'ve been working on

2017-04-26T14:14:58 <colinclark> simonjb: oh thanks\xe2\x80\x94you too!
2017-04-26T14:15:21 <colinclark> I\'d really like to work on a version that has more of the reflection included\xe2\x80\x94calum\'s and yours
2017-04-26T14:16:00 <colinclark> and less of the technology emphasis that of course is a key aspect of the EC review
2017-04-26T14:21:19 <cindyli> not a problem, thanks for helping with all those experiments, stegru
2017-04-26T14:21:25 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-04-26T14:21:49 <Caren> colinclark, simonjb: agree, the video is wonderful! it flows nicely.
2017-04-26T14:22:07 <colinclark> Caren: I\'m glad you like it!
2017-04-26T14:22:24 <colinclark> I haven\'t listed it publicly on YouTube\xe2\x80\x94until I hear what Calum and Miles think first :)
2017-04-26T14:22:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: alanharnum is working on a PR to update the hewelett logo used on the floe site, do you know if it\'s okay if we style it for the contrast themes? or should we keep it as is in all cases?
2017-04-26T14:22:50 <Caren> will show the boys this evening, colinclark. I\xe2\x80\x99ll report back :-)
2017-04-26T14:22:54 <colinclark> Caren: Thanks for all your help making it!
2017-04-26T14:23:18 <colinclark> I tried to work in this great clip I had of Miles operating the big camera, but wasn\'t quite able to find the spot for it
2017-04-26T14:23:19 * michelled has quit
2017-04-26T14:23:33 <colinclark> but I did use some of their footage, which was cool
2017-04-26T14:23:37 <Caren> pleasure, really. Lovely bunch to hang with :-)
2017-04-26T14:24:08 <simonjb> Caren: it was really great, thank you
2017-04-26T14:24:27 <alanharnum> Caren: yeah, it was awesome
2017-04-26T14:24:32 <Caren> I will point out the footage that Miles took. He is a \xe2\x80\x9cbehind the scenes\xe2\x80\x9d kinda person so may enjoy that aspect in the video
2017-04-26T14:25:43 <Caren> he enjoys being \xe2\x80\x9ccreepy camera guy\xe2\x80\x9d haha.
2017-04-26T14:25:48 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-04-26T14:25:57 <colinclark> he was really good at it
2017-04-26T14:26:08 <colinclark> when I edit up the version with the reflective sections, there will be lots of his footage
2017-04-26T14:26:22 <colinclark> and looking at the raw footage, he tried lots of interesting techniques
2017-04-26T14:26:28 <colinclark> sometimes close up, sometimes more wide angle
2017-04-26T14:26:41 <colinclark> he tried lower and higher perspectives, camera movement
2017-04-26T14:26:44 <colinclark> it was pretty cool
2017-04-26T14:27:29 <colinclark> Caren: I could have used your help with the titles\xe2\x80\x94it was 1 am and I had to stop fiddling with layout and typography
2017-04-26T14:27:38 <colinclark> but maybe when we make the other version you can help with it
2017-04-26T14:27:49 <alanharnum> colinclark: I actually really like the pH sonification as the ambient background for the video
2017-04-26T14:27:53 <Caren> very interesting. He\xe2\x80\x99s never filmed before. Thanks for giving him the opportunity.
2017-04-26T14:28:28 <colinclark> alanharnum: yes, it worked surprisingly well
2017-04-26T14:28:32 <Caren> colinclark: the titles look great. But I\xe2\x80\x99m always happy to work with type if required :-)
2017-04-26T14:28:43 <alanharnum> colinclark: this video is fantastic
2017-04-26T14:28:48 <alanharnum> nice job :)
2017-04-26T14:28:55 <colinclark> the clip I was saddest to edit out, alanharnum, was you explanation all the different villains in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
2017-04-26T14:28:58 <alanharnum> hahahahaha
2017-04-26T14:29:01 <colinclark> you outdid yourself on that one
2017-04-26T14:29:16 <colinclark> you\'ve got a such a great approach
2017-04-26T14:29:17 <Caren> hahaha
2017-04-26T14:29:34 <alanharnum> outtakes reel imo
2017-04-26T14:29:34 <colinclark> and I think you can realy see it in the guessing game section, alanharnum
2017-04-26T14:29:38 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-04-26T14:29:59 <simonjb> I missed the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles explanation :(
2017-04-26T14:30:00 <Caren> yes! outtakes reel
2017-04-26T14:30:03 <alanharnum> me explaining the depth and range of TMNT villains, and how acid and lava are both fatal, but in different ways
2017-04-26T14:30:15 <colinclark> that\'s right!
2017-04-26T14:30:24 <simonjb> cool
2017-04-26T14:30:42 <alanharnum> love that high-fiving you captured during the guessing game
2017-04-26T14:30:43 <colinclark> I also didn\'t include a "FIRST RULE OF SCIENCE: WE DON\'T EAT THE SCIENCE" clip
2017-04-26T14:30:49 <simonjb> yeah, the guessing game was great
2017-04-26T14:31:45 <Caren> Haha\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t eat the science! very important
2017-04-26T14:32:11 <alanharnum> i\'m self-interestedly glad to have myself on film for this and the ILDH, because I can now more easily explain to family & friends what my job entails :)
2017-04-26T14:32:21 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-04-26T14:32:54 <colinclark> once we edit up the less technical versions with the reflection sessions, it might be nice to have a crit about this
2017-04-26T14:33:16 <Caren> brilliant! alanharnum
2017-04-26T14:33:17 <colinclark> about the video itself and then use that to discuss strategies for more activity-based feedback and codesign sessions
2017-04-26T14:33:47 <Caren> good idea, colinclark
2017-04-26T14:36:00 <Caren> colinclark: speaking of codesign sessions, do you have time tomorrow or Monday to chat with me and jhung about our upcoming session\xe2\x80\xa6which we are now calling Create-a-thon?
2017-04-26T14:36:11 <colinclark> yes, I do!
2017-04-26T14:36:17 <colinclark> that\'s a great name, by the way
2017-04-26T14:36:46 <colinclark> i can chat sometime today before 1 pm or tomorrow after the review and the SJRK meeting
2017-04-26T14:36:50 <colinclark> or anytime on Monday
2017-04-26T14:37:00 <Caren> thanks goes to liskovoi for the name!
2017-04-26T14:37:41 * michelled joined the channel
2017-04-26T14:38:23 <Caren> colinclark: I don\xe2\x80\x99t see jhung here so I will send an email invite right now to hold a time. thanks
2017-04-26T14:47:21 <colinclark> hey alanharnum, can you paste me a link to the code where you transform the sensor data into speeds on the phSynth\'s granulator input?
2017-04-26T14:48:37 <alanharnum> colinclark: https://github.com/waharnum/nexus-demos/blob/GPII-2189/science-lab/sensor-presentations/js/sensorPlayer.js#L85
2017-04-26T14:49:01 <alanharnum> colinclark: sorry, actually https://github.com/waharnum/nexus-demos/blob/GPII-2189/science-lab/sensor-presentations/js/sensorPlayer.js#L99
2017-04-26T14:49:17 <alanharnum> that\'s the granulator speed.
2017-04-26T14:49:50 <colinclark> awesome!
2017-04-26T14:49:51 <colinclark> thanks
2017-04-26T14:50:12 <colinclark> we should also have a conversation soon to talk about how to extract some generalized transforms into the second part of our "sonification framework"
2017-04-26T14:50:26 <colinclark> the part that isn\'t Flocking/Signaletic, but more about data manipulation
2017-04-26T14:52:52 <alanharnum> colinclark: yup, having a robust library of transforms will be generally useful
2017-04-26T14:53:43 <alanharnum> i\'m thinking more and more about how things we\'ve done for the Nexus & Chart Authoring should be extracted into reusable libraries for Infusion-based code, rather than coupled closely to specific projects
2017-04-26T14:59:58 <michelled> alanharnum, simonjb, colinclark: I\'m thinking we should meet next week sometime and put together a comprehensive list of next steps for all the science lab related work
2017-04-26T15:00:15 <michelled> that way we can prioritize it and hopefully fit things in going forward
2017-04-26T15:01:28 <simonjb> sounds good michelled
2017-04-26T15:02:13 <Justin_o> cindyli: regarding the PR i mentioned above. I\'m going to make some more changes to it
2017-04-26T15:02:21 * jhung joined the channel
2017-04-26T15:03:31 <cindyli> Justin_o: the PR for hewlette logo?
2017-04-26T15:03:40 <Justin_o> cindyli:  no for UIO
2017-04-26T15:03:44 <Justin_o> but i guess you didn\'t see it :)
2017-04-26T15:04:01 <cindyli> nah, apparently i missed it
2017-04-26T15:07:16 <colinclark> michelled: That sounds great
2017-04-26T15:13:14 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: congrats your gpii-pouchdb makes into the master. i\'m going to update my universal pull request to use it. noticed you made this change to the pouchdb tests - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/pull/13/commits/f084ebd9e26d8b3c53a334a921fdfa975f347eb7. does it mean i need to make the similar change for the "pouchConfig" option by specifying "_replicator" and "pouch__all_dbs__" for a cleaner cleanup?
2017-04-26T15:14:17 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ve left some comments on https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/31 -- sorry it has taken me so long!
