b'2017-09-14T12:57:32 <Justin_o> yuriy__: right, because these don\'t look like the final versions.. i guess you could start by using the sliders, steppers and switches from infusion and then making any changes as needed when the final designs are in
2017-09-14T12:57:49 <Justin_o> that\'s interesting
2017-09-14T12:58:28 <Justin_o> yuriy__: so what point are you at right now?

2017-09-14T13:30:21 <georgitodorov> Hi everyone. I need some help with the selection protocomponent type which seems to require non-empty optionlist and optionnames arrays. I am trying to figure out how not to display such a subcomponent (not only not display it but it should not initialize at all). Any help will be greatly appreciated!
2017-09-14T13:31:10 <georgitodorov> What I was thinking of trying was some kind of combination between using a `createOnEvent` to create this subcomponent and a condition expander but I don\'t know if this is the correct approach.
2017-09-14T13:40:41 <Justin_o> georgitodorov: do you have some code you can share
2017-09-14T13:45:40 <georgitodorov> Justin_o: Sure, https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/pcp_channel_communication/src/settings.js#L641
2017-09-14T13:46:07 <georgitodorov> Here you can see that I have a "gpii.pcp.header" component which has a subcomponent ("preferenceSetPicker")
2017-09-14T13:46:46 <georgitodorov> The preference set picker uses internally the selection protocomponent type but sometimes the preferenceSets can be empty
2017-09-14T13:47:35 <georgitodorov> In such cases, the framework throws an error. I want to avoid that by not initializing this subcomponent somehow and not rendering its markup at all
2017-09-14T13:56:22 <Bosmon2> Hi georgitodorov - in this case you can override this component by one whose type is "fluid.emptySubcomponent"
2017-09-14T13:57:54 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-09-14T13:58:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon2, georgitodorov: was just looking at this, i wonder also if instead the onAvailableSettingsReceived event could only be fired when the preferencesSet is populated
2017-09-14T13:59:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: also another question for you regarding https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/844#discussion_r137302821
2017-09-14T14:00:20 * danayo joined the channel
2017-09-14T14:00:29 <Justin_o> was wondering how to get the panelCount in the model if it is dependent on the number of dom elements
2017-09-14T14:01:14 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2017-09-14T14:02:36 <Justin_o> georgitodorov: i\'m also not sure of the design and use case exactly.. do you have some wireframes you could share for it
2017-09-14T14:03:20 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Is it possible to dynamically change the type of a subcomponent once it is created?
2017-09-14T14:03:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - although we tend not to have many markup-driven components these days, it\'s still a perfectly possible thing to do
2017-09-14T14:03:50 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - no, once component creation starts, its type is fixed, although further grades may be added on to it
2017-09-14T14:04:00 <Bosmon> But you can\'t change the decision about whether it is a fluid.emptySubcomponent or not, obviously
2017-09-14T14:04:08 <Bosmon> Since the whole point of a fluid.emptySubcomponent is not to instantiate : P
2017-09-14T14:04:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you could just write a definition in the model that initialises its value based on an expander
2017-09-14T14:04:42 <Bosmon> I think there are examples of this in the Pager
2017-09-14T14:05:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that\'s what i was wondering, if expanders were acceptable in models.. wasn\'t sure if it would affect transformation and relays for example
2017-09-14T14:05:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it will be treated as an initial value
2017-09-14T14:05:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: excellent thanks
2017-09-14T14:05:48 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: So I should set the gradeName when the component is created. And if the provided array is empty - I should use the emptySubcomponent?
2017-09-14T14:06:05 <georgitodorov> I.e. have a function which determines the grade
2017-09-14T14:06:05 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - the decision on emptySubcomponent is just based on the resolved value of "type"
2017-09-14T14:06:14 <Bosmon> Once that has been evaluated, the fate of the component is set
2017-09-14T14:06:21 <Bosmon> And if it is empty, all supplied configuration will be ignored

2017-09-14T15:01:44 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2017-09-14T15:01:53 <simonjb> cindyli: do you revoke existing access tokens?
2017-09-14T15:02:02 <simonjb> or just create new
2017-09-14T15:02:08 <cindyli> just create new
2017-09-14T15:02:19 <simonjb> ok
2017-09-14T15:02:51 <cindyli> i think the existing ones should not be revoked in case they are still in use. the revoke should only happen with an explicit revoke request
2017-09-14T15:03:43 <simonjb> I think this is reasonable for now as they do expire after an hour
2017-09-14T15:04:08 <simonjb> but we can maybe think going forward if revoking is something we want
2017-09-14T15:08:16 <cindyli> agree

2017-09-14T09:41:21 <javjarfer> stegru, good morning!
2017-09-14T09:41:30 <stegru> hi javjarfer
2017-09-14T09:41:43 <javjarfer> do you want to hear a horror history?
2017-09-14T09:42:13 <stegru> if it\'s about you
2017-09-14T09:42:17 <javjarfer> xDDD
2017-09-14T09:42:30 <javjarfer> I\'m the victim
2017-09-14T09:42:38 <stegru> good ;)
2017-09-14T09:42:59 <javjarfer> have a little mercy xD
2017-09-14T09:43:11 <stegru> heh go on, what happened?
2017-09-14T09:44:01 <javjarfer> well, I have found in UIA the weirdest inconsistence in a windows API, but NOW I think I know the reason
2017-09-14T09:44:07 <javjarfer> and I think it\'s related with this
2017-09-14T09:44:10 <javjarfer> https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/7345
2017-09-14T09:44:13 <stegru> ok
2017-09-14T09:46:07 <javjarfer> thing is that, the reception of API in the client side (UIA has a structure of server client, in which you only have access to the client using the COM object for that, object that Microsoft doesn\'t use in their own products by the way) becomes unstable under certain conditions
2017-09-14T09:46:16 <javjarfer> do you know what magical condition?
2017-09-14T09:46:25 <javjarfer> the presence of task manager
2017-09-14T09:46:31 <javjarfer> AS A RUNNING PROCESS
2017-09-14T09:46:49 <javjarfer> and do you know when the inconsistence stops?
2017-09-14T09:47:01 <javjarfer> when running under privilege mode
2017-09-14T09:47:35 <stegru> so
2017-09-14T09:47:54 <stegru> it just fails if you have task manager open?
2017-09-14T09:48:08 <stegru> even if you\'re not actually accessing task manager?
2017-09-14T09:48:51 <javjarfer> so, it looks like the process manager, injects something and consumes the events, and when the are needed to came back, the are delayed because of some weird synchronization between privilege and no-privilege mode
2017-09-14T09:48:55 <javjarfer> stegru, that is right
2017-09-14T09:49:10 <javjarfer> just with being present as a running process is enough
2017-09-14T09:49:14 <stegru> ah ok
2017-09-14T09:49:23 <stegru> that\'s strange
2017-09-14T09:49:34 <javjarfer> take that common sense
2017-09-14T09:50:07 <stegru> is it just task manager? or any other high-privilege process?
2017-09-14T09:50:20 <javjarfer> I have only identify it with task manager
2017-09-14T09:50:35 <stegru> what about process explorer, procmon?
2017-09-14T09:50:44 <stegru> no, procexp
2017-09-14T09:50:49 <javjarfer> Even process hacker doesn\'t exhibit same behavior
2017-09-14T09:51:06 <javjarfer> mmm don\'t know, I usually use processhacker2
2017-09-14T09:51:10 <stegru> it must be doing something special
2017-09-14T09:51:41 <javjarfer> yes, I have been like crazy for 2 days
2017-09-14T09:51:48 <javjarfer> because it suddenly stop working
2017-09-14T09:51:50 <stegru> does it un-crash if you click the start button?
2017-09-14T09:52:09 <javjarfer> nop, it un-crash just exiting task-manager
2017-09-14T09:52:44 <javjarfer> I think that should be something about the kind of process-introspection it does
2017-09-14T09:52:52 <stegru> how is it related to the nvda problem?
2017-09-14T09:53:22 <javjarfer> They have inconsistences and they haven\'t been able to determine the source
2017-09-14T09:53:25 <javjarfer> only with UIA
2017-09-14T09:54:32 <stegru> ah ok
2017-09-14T09:54:48 <javjarfer> " Narrator becomes unresponsive in all apps when a single app is continually slow to respond"
2017-09-14T09:55:27 <stegru> yes, because for some reason it\'s interracting with the slow app at the same time
2017-09-14T09:56:18 <javjarfer> yes, It could be that, the kind of introspection that they do to the process, they are \'slowly\' passing the messages of UIA or more slowly that it should
2017-09-14T09:56:49 <javjarfer> they are handled as every other events in windows interface it they are not handled in less that 50ms
2017-09-14T09:56:53 <javjarfer> they don\'t exist
2017-09-14T09:57:55 <javjarfer> maybe the kind of synchronization needed for \'privilege\' to \'under-privilege\' process, is slower than that
2017-09-14T09:58:13 <javjarfer> taking into account they are doing more things
2017-09-14T09:58:15 <stegru> ok
2017-09-14T09:58:21 <javjarfer> and you lost the events
2017-09-14T09:58:32 <javjarfer> isn\'t it crazy?
2017-09-14T09:58:54 <stegru> it\'s just one big hack, windows
2017-09-14T09:59:29 <javjarfer> .....
2017-09-14T09:59:56 <javjarfer> yes... well, back to work, just wanted to sahre
2017-09-14T10:00:09 <javjarfer> share** this great history of the non-sense
2017-09-14T10:00:12 <stegru> thanks
2017-09-14T10:00:52 <stegru> GPII-2001 is another unexplained mystery of the universe
2017-09-14T10:01:13 <javjarfer> yw!
2017-09-14T10:01:29 <javjarfer> mm never heard of it
2017-09-14T10:01:31 <javjarfer> taking a look
2017-09-14T10:02:08 <stegru> setting the width of windows borders freezes SPI, until the start menu is opened
2017-09-14T10:03:08 <javjarfer> xDDDDD
2017-09-14T10:03:55 <javjarfer> okay, that is also crazy, something to be with WM_WININICHANGE\xc2\xbf
2017-09-14T10:07:45 <javjarfer> stegru,
2017-09-14T10:08:51 <javjarfer> also, now that we have the fWinIni parameter, maybe it could be a good idea to check if SPIF_SENDCHANGE makes a difference
2017-09-14T10:09:11 <javjarfer> for whatever reason MS do, I think that clicking that button does that
2017-09-14T10:11:04 <stegru> i was just thinking the same - but i probably tried that, when i was testing in C
2017-09-14T10:11:15 <stegru> but yes, it\'s sort of related to something like that
2017-09-14T10:11:55 <stegru> a metro app that\'s paused doesn\'t respond to a message
2017-09-14T10:14:24 <javjarfer> mmm metro app which is paused?
2017-09-14T10:15:04 <stegru> cortana.. or whatever it is that does the search in the start menu
2017-09-14T10:15:42 <javjarfer> stegru, haha yeah, or whatever it is that is a great naming for it
2017-09-14T10:15:52 <stegru> SearchUI.exe
2017-09-14T10:16:53 <javjarfer> maybe we need to make a script that stream all the know messages one by one
2017-09-14T10:17:27 <javjarfer> I think I have something I made some weeks ago
2017-09-14T10:19:05 <javjarfer> sure they have a complete table of \'how people outside think things work -> how they actually work"
2017-09-14T10:19:05 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-09-14T10:19:21 * dandimitrov has quit
2017-09-14T10:19:46 <javjarfer> and when you pay the support, they search in the table

2017-09-14T10:21:08 <javjarfer> stegru, omagaaad https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170908-00/?p=96965
2017-09-14T10:21:12 <javjarfer> this site is gold
2017-09-14T10:22:31 <stegru> yep
2017-09-14T10:22:57 <javjarfer> like all this sites, are ruled by Microsoft employees
2017-09-14T10:23:18 <javjarfer> https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/winuiautomation/
2017-09-14T10:23:29 <javjarfer> the advantages of being able to see code
2017-09-14T10:36:12 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-09-14T10:42:11 <javjarfer> stegru, one question about com objects
2017-09-14T10:42:19 <stegru> yes?
2017-09-14T10:42:33 <javjarfer> if you use CoCreateInstance and you got a COM object loaded
2017-09-14T10:42:38 <stegru> yes
2017-09-14T10:43:14 <javjarfer> if the process crash, how you guarantee that the COM object will be freed?
2017-09-14T10:43:24 <javjarfer> because they still living for me
2017-09-14T10:44:11 <javjarfer> even creating the COM object with the CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER
2017-09-14T10:44:18 <stegru> is it from a different process?
2017-09-14T10:44:20 <stegru> oh
2017-09-14T10:44:34 <javjarfer> which I assumed that was for linking with the actual process
2017-09-14T10:44:51 <javjarfer> but it actually loads other process
2017-09-14T10:45:05 <stegru> how do you know it\'s still alive?
2017-09-14T10:46:10 <javjarfer> I see it in processhacker
2017-09-14T10:46:15 <javjarfer> as COM Surrogate
2017-09-14T10:46:33 <stegru> i don\'t know how you\'d get rid of it, then
2017-09-14T10:46:56 <javjarfer> okay! Thanks!
2017-09-14T11:00:24 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-09-14T11:09:41 <javjarfer> stegru, okay, that COM Surrogate is not my business
2017-09-14T11:09:51 <stegru> ok :)
2017-09-14T11:10:22 <javjarfer> it looks like it\'s something related to the development environment of VS when you deal with COM object and other system parts

2017-09-14T12:52:36 <yuriy__> Hi, Justin_o
2017-09-14T12:52:45 <Justin_o> yuriy__: hello
2017-09-14T12:52:46 <yuriy__> I wanted to ask you some questions on how to proceed with the styling of the PCP client. Do you have some time to discuss?
2017-09-14T12:53:08 <Justin_o> sure
2017-09-14T12:53:14 <Justin_o> how can i help
2017-09-14T12:53:52 <yuriy__> I\xc2\xb4m actually not really sure if I should be asking you at this point or we should get some more information from Bern first
2017-09-14T12:54:38 <yuriy__> but we have only some wireframes, for example the one https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2137 (and some other similar wireframes)
2017-09-14T12:55:43 <yuriy__> and we are using these wireframes for the general appearance of PCP, but we don\xc2\xb4t know how to go from there
2017-09-14T12:57:08 <yuriy__> we discussed that it shouldn\xc2\xb4t follow exactly the Windows 10 UX because it will be used across other OS and Bern suggested doing some changes to the colors of the PCP based on the color of the OS
2017-09-14T12:57:25 <yuriy__> but nothing really specific
