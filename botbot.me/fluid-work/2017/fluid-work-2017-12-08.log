b"2017-12-08T21:41:50 <Bosmon> What's going on with your tests?
2017-12-08T21:43:11 <gmoss> We're having trouble getting a test sequence to complete. it seems to be hanging waiting for a change event. In the commit above you can see that we defined our modelRelay, and it seems to be working properly when testing manually. in our sequence, though, it hangs while waiting for the modelChanged event for the storySpeaker's ttsText. Here's our sequence, currently:

2017-12-08T21:43:57 <michelled> (Rootbeer is a cat, btw. :)
2017-12-08T21:43:59 <gmoss> with the last two sequence items commented out, it will run to completion, but the moment we uncomment either of the two subsequent items, it will hang

2017-12-08T13:13:47 <stegru> jhernandez: I\'ve managed to reproduce that weird corruption bug, by repeatedly calling the write/read registry functions
2017-12-08T13:14:28 <jhernandez> stegru: you hit the carpet very seriously,  huh?!
2017-12-08T13:14:51 <jhernandez> that\'s awesome!
2017-12-08T13:14:59 <stegru> yeh.. but I can\'t reliably hit it
2017-12-08T13:15:38 <jhernandez> I know
2017-12-08T13:16:20 <stegru> i\'m calling it millions of times, I\'ve only had the bug a few times
2017-12-08T13:16:32 <jhernandez> and,  did the gpii finished crashing?
2017-12-08T13:17:14 <stegru> well, i\'ve made a loop that calls the registry functions
2017-12-08T13:18:10 <stegru> i write a value, then read it back, and compare
2017-12-08T13:18:16 <jhernandez> okok
2017-12-08T13:19:08 <javjarfer[m]> > i write a value, then read it back, and compare
2017-12-08T13:19:08 <javjarfer[m]> Really weird
2017-12-08T13:19:12 <jhernandez> and, the "corruption" happens in the registry  ... isn\'t it?
2017-12-08T13:19:34 <stegru> i don\'t know yet.. it could be windows, ffi, or gpii
2017-12-08T13:19:35 <jhernandez> I mean, at some point, a registry key contains corrupted data
2017-12-08T13:19:42 <jhernandez> okay
2017-12-08T13:20:35 <javjarfer[m]> mmm stegru we should check directly with C#
2017-12-08T13:21:04 <javjarfer[m]> simply read write?
2017-12-08T13:21:19 <stegru> yes, but i doubt it\'s a registry bug
2017-12-08T13:22:08 <javjarfer[m]> yes, it would have showed up previously, and in many more apps

2017-12-08T13:26:44 <stegru> yes that\'s what I\'m doing now - just have to wait for it to happen ;)
2017-12-08T13:28:53 <javjarfer[m]> > yes that\'s what I\'m doing now - just have to wait for it to happen ;)

2017-12-08T15:11:36 <Bosmon> stegru - so how are empty values intended to be stored?
2017-12-08T15:11:44 <Bosmon> What are "empty values" anyway : P
2017-12-08T15:13:10 <stegru> zero length strings, as registry values - in the registry they are "", but GPII+FFI converts them to a string by looking for the null character
2017-12-08T15:13:17 <Bosmon> jhernandez - urgent message from Whitney
2017-12-08T15:13:22 <Bosmon> Apparently she has not been given the installer

2017-12-08T16:37:11 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I wasn\'t getting audio in Vidyo, so here\'s my stand-up update. I\'ve been continuing my experimentation in Hugo, currently trying to get a better handle at making a generalizable navigation template partial. I\'m going to document this theme I\'ve built so that CMHR can use it. Also chatted with Kelsey yesterday afternoon to talk about CC licensing.

2017-12-08T21:31:57 <Bosmon> What was the question?
2017-12-08T21:35:30 <gmoss> Bosmon: michelled and I were refactoring the SJRK storytelling tool a little bit in order to set ourselves up for adding a new test. We were unsure how to make a change to a component\'s model inside a modelListener on the same model, but we made some further changes and added a modelRelay to get the job done instead:

2017-12-08T21:35:48 <gmoss> but now, we\'re having trouble setting up said test. do you still have a moment? :)
2017-12-08T21:37:48 <Bosmon> hi
2017-12-08T21:39:36 <Bosmon> You do know that ADTKINS implemented a stringTemplate transform, right? : P

2017-12-08T21:40:07 <gmoss> well, we can make that change after haha
2017-12-08T21:40:12 <gmoss> thank you for pointing that out!
