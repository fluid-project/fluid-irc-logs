2017-12-13T17:40:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @avtar, the tests now fail in a way that is convincing.
2017-12-13T17:40:29 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. there are browser disconnects, but those are also cropping up elsewhere.

2017-12-13T12:28:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Can anyone point me to the CI builds for the infusion pull?
2017-12-13T12:29:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to confirm how many browser tests are run.
2017-12-13T12:29:29 <the-t-in-rtf> We\'re seeing a varying number of tests results reported on repeated successful runs.
2017-12-13T12:29:34 <the-t-in-rtf> By "we" I mean @bosm
2017-12-13T12:29:40 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon2 and I
2017-12-13T12:30:42 <gtirloni> CI builds for infusion are here: https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-tests/
2017-12-13T12:32:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Why does this only have 148 results? https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-tests/124/tapTestReport/
2017-12-13T12:33:22 <gtirloni> should it have more?
2017-12-13T12:33:31 <the-t-in-rtf> hundreds and hundreds more.
2017-12-13T12:33:46 <gtirloni> interesting. you can see the logs here: https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-tests/124/console
2017-12-13T12:33:49 <the-t-in-rtf> there are over 500 browser tests and it\'s running the tests in two browsers.
2017-12-13T12:34:34 <gtirloni> it\'s running `grunt tests`
2017-12-13T12:36:46 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the new pull updates that to use pure npm, so I\'m afraid that\'s not helpful.  At least it runs the same number of tests consistently.
2017-12-13T12:38:53 <the-t-in-rtf> We\'re also encountering this on Windows, which that wouldn\'t help with.
2017-12-13T12:39:00 <the-t-in-rtf> So I guess at least we have a couple of data points to explore.
2017-12-13T12:39:45 <gtirloni> Avtar has been working with a new CI system and I believe he enabled builds for infusion PR\'s: https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/fluid-infusion/builds/20 (but it\'s the same `grunt tests` that gets executed)
2017-12-13T12:39:58 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, it won\'t change until my pull is ready to be merged.
2017-12-13T12:40:03 <gtirloni> ok
2017-12-13T12:40:06 <the-t-in-rtf> as my pull actually changes the test commands.
2017-12-13T12:40:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for the links and the info.

2017-12-13T14:55:45 <simonjb> Justin_o: cool, do you think something like this might be useful? Do we have something like this already?
2017-12-13T14:56:05 <Justin_o> looks really good, thanks for adding it. I have a couple questions though.. 1) could you expand on the marker grades section. Maybe with an explanation on what a marker grade is or when you\'d want to use it. 2) are there any examples for "asynchronous tasks in a pipeline". I have one coming in the work I\'m doing for a datasource component for fluid-6209 but was wondering if there are other examples that are
2017-12-13T14:56:05 <Justin_o> available to link to already
2017-12-13T14:56:27 <Justin_o> simonjb: there was a best practices page i think, but it\'s possibly out of date.. i\'ll see if i can find it.
2017-12-13T14:57:15 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-12-13T14:57:33 <simonjb> Justin_o: oh yes, I will definitely expand with descriptions and more examples! Not intended to be finished by any means :)

2017-12-13T15:04:29 <Justin_o> simonjb: i can\'t find the best practices page.. maybe it was removed

2017-12-13T15:05:46 <simonjb> Justin_o: I\'d also like to include discussions of potentially negative qualities of design choices -- "this approach is great for these situations but beware of these risks" -- which is a little different from simply presenting \'best practices\'
2017-12-13T15:06:09 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks for looking
2017-12-13T15:07:05 <Justin_o> simonjb: that\'s a good idea too.. good to know the pros and cons of using something so you better understand when to do one thing or another
2017-12-13T15:07:16 <simonjb> yes, exactly
2017-12-13T15:07:39 <simonjb> designs are often trade-offs
2017-12-13T15:09:07 <Justin_o> that\'s a good point
2017-12-13T15:15:52 * avtar joined the channel
2017-12-13T15:19:28 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: you can change which commands are run by buildkite by modifying the pipeline config https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/.buildkite/pipeline.yml#L19 and including that as part of your pull request

2017-12-13T15:52:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess the commit that changes the pipeline config also triggers a new build?

2017-12-13T16:53:19 <colinclark> So cindyli, what motivated the change in service topology for the Flow Manager and the Preferences Server? Why did you decide to move the Preferences Server directly into the Flow Manager\'s runtime?
2017-12-13T16:54:54 <cindyli> colinclark: looking at your puzzling face at the standup, i know you will ask\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-12-13T16:54:59 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-12-13T16:55:03 <colinclark> did I look puzzled?
2017-12-13T16:55:06 <colinclark> I guess I probably was :)
2017-12-13T16:55:41 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-12-13T16:55:53 <cindyli> the other day, Bosmon2/Bosmon9 and I were talking about replacing the unsecured http endpoints provided by the preferences server with internal invokers
2017-12-13T16:56:16 <colinclark> ah, ok
2017-12-13T16:56:20 <cindyli> once they are removed, the preferences server will no longer be a kettle server
2017-12-13T16:56:38 <cindyli> the way i think is to make it a subcomponent of the flow manager
2017-12-13T16:56:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @avtar, I didn\'t realise the tests weren\'t running inside a VM already.
2017-12-13T16:56:56 <cindyli> Bosmon2/Bosmon9, does that sound good to you?
2017-12-13T16:56:57 <colinclark> And what\'s the primary advantage to this, in your mind?
2017-12-13T16:57:24 <cindyli> 1. easier for the auth server and the prefs server to share one database
2017-12-13T16:57:41 <colinclark> how so?
2017-12-13T16:57:42 <cindyli> 2. more secured with less unsecured endpoints to protect
2017-12-13T16:57:52 <colinclark> I guess "unsecured" is relative here
2017-12-13T16:58:10 <colinclark> to a distinction between "internal" and "external" endpoints
2017-12-13T16:58:48 <colinclark> i.e. those endpoints designed for parts of the system, internally, to communicate over HTTP in order to provide a boundary for scaling, for example
2017-12-13T16:58:59 <colinclark> versus those we expose to the internet
2017-12-13T16:59:16 <cindyli> i agree. still, less effort to keep them internally
2017-12-13T16:59:49 <cindyli> colinclark: any benefit you\'d like to have the preferences server running as a standalone without the flow manager?
2017-12-13T16:59:52 <colinclark> it seems to me that the primary upside to co-locating a service within the same Node.js instance is the speed and simplicity of direct invocation, and the primary downside is the inability to scale one portion of the infrastructure indepedently of the other
2017-12-13T17:00:05 <colinclark> cindyli: I\'m not sure I feel strongly one way or the other
2017-12-13T17:00:34 <colinclark> I just like to be clear on the motivations for a change like this, and to be sure we\'ve weight all the pros and cons
2017-12-13T17:01:26 <cindyli> colinclark: what do you think about talking about this in the arch meeting that is coming up now?
2017-12-13T17:01:32 <cindyli> or a smaller group discussion?
2017-12-13T17:03:37 <colinclark> I have another meeting, so I won\'t be there
2017-12-13T17:03:56 <colinclark> I don\'t know if a group discussion is needed\xe2\x80\x94that\'s up to you
