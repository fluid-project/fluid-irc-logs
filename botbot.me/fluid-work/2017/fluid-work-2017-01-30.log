2017-01-30T21:54:44 <Bosmon> simonjb - do you think you might have time to cast an eye over https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/497 at some point?
2017-01-30T21:54:57 <Bosmon> It would be helpful for the HST to get it looked over
2017-01-30T21:56:06 <simonjb> yes I can do that Bosmon
2017-01-30T21:56:11 <simonjb> would tomorrow be ok?
2017-01-30T21:56:34 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure, that's great!
2017-01-30T21:56:46 <simonjb> will do
2017-01-30T21:57:10 <simonjb> I assigned the PR to me

2017-01-30T15:58:15 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar, @amatas, I am seeing two levels of brokenness in the QI environment at the moment: http://i-0044.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/job/gpii-binder-tests/56/console
2017-01-30T15:58:30 <the-t-in-rtf> 1) the build fails with an NPE, which indicates some problem on the server itself.
2017-01-30T15:58:37 <the-t-in-rtf> 2) It can\'t mail anyone to report on #1
2017-01-30T16:05:23 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatar, are we still meeting?  I know Gio\'s not here.
2017-01-30T16:05:52 <amatas> yes, give me few seconds
2017-01-30T16:06:21 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I\'m ready, just exit from another meeting
2017-01-30T16:06:40 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, let\'s use my Vidyo room, I\'m having trouble getting GtM to work.

2017-01-30T17:07:47 <Justin_o> jhung: good question, at least that forwards you to the archive of the documentation
2017-01-30T17:08:02 <Justin_o> jhung: another option would be to port that documentation over to the docs site and update the link
2017-01-30T17:08:27 <jhung> Justin_o: that documentation never existed to my knowledge.
2017-01-30T17:09:00 <jhung> oh never mind. I see it now
2017-01-30T17:09:43 <jhung> Yes. I think the readme should link directly to the archived version with a note in the readme that it\'s for an older version, but still relevant Justin_o. What do you think?
2017-01-30T17:12:27 <Justin_o> jhung: i guess that\'s fine. I suppose either way we\'d need to change the link in the README when that page gets ported
2017-01-30T17:12:45 <Justin_o> jhung: although, i\'m in favour of just moving the documentation now
2017-01-30T17:13:18 <Justin_o> because i don\'t think it\'s "too much" work
2017-01-30T17:13:21 <Justin_o> could be wrong though
2017-01-30T17:19:28 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. I\'ll take a look at that.

2017-01-30T18:02:48 <colinclark> gloob: It occurs to me that we have a cut and paste issue within our license file, which has lived on quite a long time
2017-01-30T18:03:12 <colinclark> The copyright statement says "Copyright (c) 2012-17, Members of the Raising the Floor Consortium."
2017-01-30T18:03:47 <colinclark> but then later on, we have "Neither the name of OCAD University nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission."
2017-01-30T18:03:55 <colinclark> the question being "why does it say OCAD University" there at all?
2017-01-30T18:04:10 <colinclark> the answer, I think, is that someone cut and pasted the Fluid Project licenses and only half-updated them
2017-01-30T18:05:14 <gloob> I think it is PRETTY outdated
2017-01-30T18:05:17 <gloob> in fact
2017-01-30T18:05:24 <gloob> let me check our current GPII windows license
2017-01-30T18:05:59 <gloob> that is the problems with this lonely and outlaw repository ;)
2017-01-30T18:06:31 <gloob> this is our official License block for the GPII projects? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
2017-01-30T18:07:12 <gloob> what I think makes sense is to use the same everywhere, the wix repository probably is from the cloud4all ages
2017-01-30T18:07:16 <gloob> make sense?
2017-01-30T18:08:13 <colinclark> yeah
2017-01-30T18:08:29 <gloob> the universal one is slightly different than windows one https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
2017-01-30T18:08:32 <colinclark> there is no formal entity that represents the "RtF consortium," so it can\'t be a copyright holder
2017-01-30T18:08:45 <colinclark> and RTF-I is possibly the majority copyright holder
2017-01-30T18:09:06 <colinclark> it may be that OCAD has contributed more IP to GPII, I\'m not sure\xe2\x80\x94but ultimately RTF-I will be the foundation that hopefully holds all the IP
2017-01-30T18:09:12 <colinclark> once we have an attribution agreement in place
2017-01-30T18:09:48 <colinclark> so I think we actually want what\'s in universal, with the exception of replacing "OCAD University" in the third clause with "Raising the Floor - International" instead
2017-01-30T18:10:14 <gloob> but that should apply to every project, no?
2017-01-30T18:10:58 <gloob> let\'s see the linux one
2017-01-30T18:12:20 <colinclark> that license should be in all our repositories, correct
2017-01-30T18:12:25 <colinclark> all of them, consistently :)
2017-01-30T18:13:01 <colinclark> unless there is an obviously more significant copyright holder in a particular repository
2017-01-30T18:13:08 <colinclark> the first discovery tool is an example of this, I think
2017-01-30T18:18:32 <gloob> this is windows one, that I think is a good base https://gist.github.com/gloob/66228ed982d9de8f5c9a4c4d13aa5e30
2017-01-30T18:19:00 <gloob> but then, in the universal one there\'s a preamble about that could exists others licenses declaration into the code
2017-01-30T18:19:24 <gloob> are BSD?
2017-01-30T18:19:28 <gloob> are we
2017-01-30T18:21:52 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-30T18:24:14 <gloob> colinclark: does it looks good https://gist.github.com/gloob/66228ed982d9de8f5c9a4c4d13aa5e30 ? basically it\'s the BSD 3-clause license with RTF-I as copyright holder
2017-01-30T18:29:27 * yzen has quit
2017-01-30T18:31:44 <colinclark> Yes, we are "new" BSD (3-clause)
2017-01-30T18:31:48 <colinclark> and yes, this looks fine
2017-01-30T18:31:58 <gloob> colinclark: good, thanks
2017-01-30T18:32:01 <colinclark> although I think the actual name of RTF-I is "Raising the Floor - International"
2017-01-30T18:32:11 <colinclark> so I think you\'ll want to add the dash back
2017-01-30T18:32:17 <colinclark> you can probably confirm that
2017-01-30T18:32:22 <gloob> I will
2017-01-30T18:32:25 <colinclark> being an employee of said organization :)
2017-01-30T18:32:43 <gloob> well
2017-01-30T18:32:54 <gloob> what means employee? :P
2017-01-30T18:33:09 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-30T18:33:12 <gloob> nah, it is right
2017-01-30T18:33:23 <gloob> I will check in formal docs
2017-01-30T18:33:56 <gloob> make sense to trigger a multi bombing of PRs to others repositories?
2017-01-30T18:34:46 <gloob> at least universal, windows and linux as far as I can tell

2017-01-30T19:54:02 <simonjb> ages ago we were talking about using the instantiator onComponentAttach to watch for new components for the Nexus Co-Occurrence Engine
2017-01-30T19:54:21 <simonjb> I implemented that this morning but am having a little trouble
2017-01-30T19:54:23 * avtar joined the channel
2017-01-30T19:54:52 <simonjb> I get the events fine but when the event is fired the new component isn\'t yet constructed
2017-01-30T19:55:14 <simonjb> lifecycleStatus is "constructing"
2017-01-30T19:55:49 <simonjb> so, it\'s too early to analyse the component to see if it matches recipe reactants
2017-01-30T19:56:07 <simonjb> I wanted to get your advice
2017-01-30T19:56:08 <simonjb> thanks!
2017-01-30T19:57:29 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, that\'s correct
2017-01-30T19:58:21 <Bosmon> It\'s a little inefficient, but it may work better to simply broadcast an onCreate listener to *
2017-01-30T19:59:15 <simonjb> I was thinking that I could put all Nexus components under their own tree
2017-01-30T19:59:25 <simonjb> that would at least limit the scope
2017-01-30T19:59:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, they should really be in one anyway
2017-01-30T19:59:59 <simonjb> cool, they are at the moment :)
2017-01-30T20:00:00 <Bosmon> Especially once we start having things like security policies, etc.
2017-01-30T20:00:37 <simonjb> how do I do the broadcast onCreate listener?
2017-01-30T20:06:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - you just construct a component holding a distributeOptions block which targets something like "/ fluid.component"
2017-01-30T20:06:38 <Bosmon> Similar to the way that FluidViewDebugging.js broadcasts its lifecycle listeners
2017-01-30T20:07:00 <simonjb> ok great, I\'ll try that, thanks Bosmon
