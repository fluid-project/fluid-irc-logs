2017-09-27T15:28:33 <cindyli> the change made to vagrant-configs/provisioning/preferences-server-vars.yml fixes error #1

2017-09-27T15:29:13 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2017-09-27T15:29:17 <simonjb> cindyli: so the port change in gpii.flowManager.config.production.json is no longer needed?
2017-09-27T15:30:37 <cindyli> still need, simonjb, that's for a separate issue. without the port change, the VM will start flow manager with port 8081, which has been used by preferenecs server
2017-09-27T15:30:52 <cindyli> the port change in my commit is not proper, i know that
2017-09-27T15:31:18 <cindyli> the proper way i think is to get rid of the distributeOptions block for the port number
2017-09-27T15:31:49 <cindyli> because it overrides the main port number being sent down from the top level config file
2017-09-27T15:31:55 <cindyli> stand up

2017-09-27T15:55:23 <amatas> stegru: was a request from Sandra
2017-09-27T15:55:33 <stegru> ah ok
2017-09-27T15:57:21 <amatas> I guess that it's also a request from Han in order to detect any problem at the AJC PCs
2017-09-27T15:58:34 <stegru> yes, I suppose he only cares about show-stoppers
2017-09-27T15:59:24 <amatas> anyway I can define multiple watchers with different filters
2017-09-27T15:59:53 <amatas> for the people who is interested in any kind of error

2017-09-27T09:11:26 <georgitodorov> Bosmon2: Hi, Antranig! We need a little help with the valueMapper. We would like to transform a string property of a component\'s model based on the value of another string property wthin the same model.
2017-09-27T09:12:34 <georgitodorov> It seems that fluid.transforms.valueMapper accepts direct input using the `input` property where we specify an IoC reference to the property on which the transformation depends
2017-09-27T09:13:11 <georgitodorov> We cannot figure out though how to specify the output (by default, it seems that the output is an object, not a single string value as in our case)

2017-09-27T13:21:38 <cindyli> simonjb: do you have a chance to try gtirloni\'s pull request for 2621?
2017-09-27T13:22:03 <cindyli> i pushed up more fixes into the pull request for GPII-2435 to fix other issues
2017-09-27T13:22:42 <simonjb> cindyli: I didn\'t try gtirloni\'s PR yet -- but was chatting with Bosmon2 a little about it yesterday
2017-09-27T13:23:09 <simonjb> cindyli: did you see that the CI build failed? and I left a comment on your change
2017-09-27T13:23:10 <cindyli> ok. in this channel? catching up..
2017-09-27T13:23:22 <cindyli> haven\'t seen that. checking..
2017-09-27T13:23:24 <simonjb> in fluid-tech
2017-09-27T13:23:36 <simonjb> amatas, are you available at the moment?
2017-09-27T13:25:58 <cindyli> simonjb: saw your comment. i\'m not surprised that the port number change would affect other tests. that\'s a thing i\'d like to talk to gtirloni today
2017-09-27T13:27:31 <simonjb> cindyli: for me, before moving forward with these changes, I think I need some clarity on which GPII configurations and which VM configurations are used where
2017-09-27T13:27:44 <simonjb> to understand the effects of changes
2017-09-27T13:28:43 <simonjb> we could talk about it at the arch meeting today
2017-09-27T13:28:54 <simonjb> or earlier if others are available here
2017-09-27T13:31:07 <simonjb> cindyli: but I will go ahead and verify the GPII-2621 PR on my Windows 10 host

2017-09-27T14:16:40 <alanharnum> PROPOSAL: we should redo the Infusion documentation using this documentation builder project called Infusion: https://thepaciellogroup.github.io/infusion/patterns/installation/
2017-09-27T14:17:23 <alanharnum> for extra Infusion we should outsource the task to these guys, who have a Toronto office whose employees I run into at meetups sometimes: https://www.infusion.com/

2017-09-27T14:22:59 <cindyli> Bosmon2: i\'m working on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2538 to secure /untrusted-settings endpoint. at the stage of updating documentation. what i\'d like to add to the documentation is,
2017-09-27T14:23:20 <cindyli> when the local flow manager requests untrusted settings from the cloud
2017-09-27T14:23:39 <cindyli> it first needs to request an access token from /access_token endpoint
2017-09-27T14:24:13 <cindyli> then embed the access token in "authorization" header when sending the next request to /untrusted-settings endpoint
2017-09-27T14:24:59 <cindyli> do you think if it makes sense to add this piece into the "technical description" section of "user login and logout flow"?
2017-09-27T14:25:00 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/loginAndLogoutFlow.md#technical-description

2017-09-27T14:27:23 <cindyli> i\'m thinking to have 2 sub-sections. one is what\'s there for the local deployment. the other is for cloud-client deployment where there is one local gpii installation and one cloud deployment

2017-09-27T15:15:56 <amatas> hi stegru, I have one question about error logs. Actually I\'m using the filter "event": "Error.*", but it seems that we only need to send the error that caused a crash/exit of GPII. Which is the event that has those errors?
2017-09-27T15:16:09 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2017-09-27T15:17:14 <stegru> amatas: well, yes.. but personally I\'m interested in seeing all errors - at least for now
2017-09-27T15:17:39 * kasparnet has quit
2017-09-27T15:17:46 <stegru> also, if it caused an exit then it wouldn\'t be logged
