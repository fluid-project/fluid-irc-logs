2017-04-27T12:53:16 <Justin_o> alanharnum: is FLOE-506 ready to be reviewed again, or are you still working on it?
2017-04-27T13:00:06 <alanharnum> Justin_o: it could be looked at again - I prospectively added the IDRC logo in parallel to the Hewlett one, but only on the index page ATM
2017-04-27T13:00:54 <alanharnum> I figure we\'ll get the footer in the shape we want it in on the index page, then I\'ll duplicate it across the various pages to avoid having to repeat that same process a number of times
2017-04-27T13:01:42 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that makes sense
2017-04-27T13:01:49 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'ll take a look at it today

2017-04-27T13:14:08 <simonjb> Justin_o: are you in the office?

2017-04-27T13:14:31 <simonjb> interesting, I keep getting errors
2017-04-27T13:14:56 <simonjb> I had errors earlier but was able to eventually log in
2017-04-27T13:15:02 <simonjb> and now I can no longer access
2017-04-27T13:15:28 <Justin_o> simonjb: not sure, could be working because i\'m in the office..
2017-04-27T13:16:03 <simonjb> alanharnum: ^
2017-04-27T13:16:10 <Justin_o> simonjb: although i\'ve seen e-mails from people who aren\'t here, so it may be something else
2017-04-27T13:16:20 <simonjb> just me :(
2017-04-27T13:16:31 <alanharnum> simonjb: all seems functional to me
2017-04-27T13:16:37 <simonjb> hmm
2017-04-27T13:16:46 <simonjb> I will try another browser
2017-04-27T13:18:46 <simonjb> nope, also erroring in Chrome

2017-04-27T13:21:44 <Justin_o> simonjb: you might need to call the IT department, if something is wrong with the setup of your account.
2017-04-27T13:21:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: but you can\'t even get to the login screen?
2017-04-27T13:23:17 <simonjb> Justin_o: I get to the login screen but when I enter my credentials, I get the above error
2017-04-27T13:23:43 <simonjb> looks like it\'s my account then, if everyone else is good
2017-04-27T13:23:57 <simonjb> I just tried a second computer running Windows and same error
2017-04-27T13:24:52 <Justin_o> simonjb: you don\'t have some sort of security app or setting that could be blocking the communication?
2017-04-27T13:25:13 <simonjb> Justin_o: I don\'t think so
2017-04-27T13:25:24 <simonjb> I think I\'ll call the IT department
2017-04-27T13:25:35 <Justin_o> good luck
2017-04-27T13:25:41 <simonjb> thanks :)

2017-04-27T13:47:04 <cindyli> the issue is that, once these lines are included within "pouchConfig" option
2017-04-27T13:47:14 <cindyli> _users: {},
2017-04-27T13:47:14 <cindyli> _replicator: {},

2017-04-27T13:47:48 <cindyli> running node all-tests.js hits "javascript heap out of memory" error - https://pastebin.com/cV89HXAk
2017-04-27T13:48:26 <cindyli> if i remove these lines and continue to use the latest gpii-pouchdb, tests would pass
2017-04-27T13:48:28 * michelled1 has quit
2017-04-27T13:49:29 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: it seems when enough number of usage of this pouch config is used, the out of memory error can be consistently reproduced
2017-04-27T13:49:57 * sirdancealot has quit
2017-04-27T13:51:22 <cindyli> if only run a portion of pouch-used tests at a time, the error would not occur
2017-04-27T13:52:12 <cindyli> any ideas?
