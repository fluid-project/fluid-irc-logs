b'2017-07-25T18:19:43 <Justin_o> i could create a nested transform with a conditional transform or valueMapper i guess.. would that make sense
2017-07-25T18:19:45 <Bosmon> And the empty object otherwise?
2017-07-25T18:20:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, but false otherwise
2017-07-25T18:20:07 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2017-07-25T18:20:27 <Bosmon> This could be done by chaining arrayToHash and the valueMapper
2017-07-25T18:20:32 <Justin_o> or maybe nothing would bee sufficient too
2017-07-25T18:20:45 <Bosmon> But chaining indexOf and the valueMapper is also fine

2017-07-25T13:10:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a model transformation that rounds to decimal value?
2017-07-25T13:11:02 <Justin_o> i only see round to an integer
2017-07-25T13:11:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - didn\'t you write one 2 months ago?
2017-07-25T13:11:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :( we only used that one in numberToString
2017-07-25T13:11:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we did write a method for this fluid.roundToDecimal
2017-07-25T13:11:54 <Bosmon> Ok, we at the least that will be usable via a freeTransform
2017-07-25T13:11:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i want to add one, should i add a new transform or modify the existing round one
2017-07-25T13:11:59 <Bosmon> But it would be useful to write a proper packaging for it
2017-07-25T13:12:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m actually in need of this for the transformation i\'m writing for the solutions registry entry for the browser extension
2017-07-25T13:13:07 <Justin_o> for converting font size from a pt value to a magnification value
2017-07-25T13:13:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2017-07-25T13:13:45 <Justin_o> so i could write up something in infusion, but we\'d need to also update universal with that version of infusion, would that be a problem?
2017-07-25T13:13:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no problem
2017-07-25T13:13:59 <Bosmon> We\'re updating universal\'s infusion all the time : P
2017-07-25T13:14:05 <Bosmon> Today, for example
2017-07-25T13:14:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) great
2017-07-25T13:14:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so i can file a JIRA and work on that, but should i make a new transform or add the feature to the current round transform

2017-07-25T13:20:37 * clown joined the channel
2017-07-25T13:21:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the output types of these two transforms are different, right?
2017-07-25T13:21:45 <Bosmon> One produces a string, and the other produces a number
2017-07-25T13:22:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'d expect them both to be numbers
2017-07-25T13:22:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there is a numberToString transformation already, which we wrote a couple months ago, that transforms to a string and does the rounding
2017-07-25T13:23:21 <Justin_o> but the model value for font size is a number, it\'s just in the text field that it displays it is a string
2017-07-25T13:24:25 <Bosmon> I imagine we can extend the existing transform
2017-07-25T13:24:39 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-07-25T13:25:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks, i\'ll do that. I\'m writing up the JIRA at the moment
2017-07-25T13:25:32 * simonjb has quit
2017-07-25T13:25:59 <Bosmon> By having it look in the transformSpec, and if it is empty, just default to the current behaviour

2017-07-25T16:27:30 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I have evaluated several versions of a comparable plugin for Confluence, but hadn\'t see that yet.

2017-07-25T16:28:47 <the-t-in-rtf> nope
2017-07-25T16:29:15 <the-t-in-rtf> They make a competing plugin for Confluence, apparently.
2017-07-25T16:29:15 <Justin_o> thanks

2017-07-25T16:29:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I can evaluate simple stuff like keyboard navigation, but using a screen reader is a bit beyond me.
2017-07-25T16:32:43 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: that covers a lot already, but yah, we can probably take a look with a screen reader. It\'d be great if we could get an actual screen reader user to give it a go too. At one point you could e-mail in to create JIRAs but i don\'t know if that still works or it ever gets used.

2017-07-25T18:16:03 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2017-07-25T18:16:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, first off i submitted a PR to Infusion and Infusion-Docs related to the rounding... could you please review those?
2017-07-25T18:17:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: secondly, i have the case where i have an array of strings that i want to transform into a boolean value if a particular string is present
2017-07-25T18:18:04 <Justin_o> so for example i want to transform ["dictionary", "thesaurus"] into {dictionaryEnabled: true}
2017-07-25T18:19:08 <Justin_o> the closest i can find is fluid.transforms.indexOf; which returns the index or -1
2017-07-25T18:19:40 <Bosmon> So you want the output to be dictionaryEnabled: true if "dictionary" is present anywhere in the list?
