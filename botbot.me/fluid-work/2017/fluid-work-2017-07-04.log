2017-07-04T16:23:25 <colinclark> hey stegru and jhernandez, what\'s your take on this, from the perspective of how the GPII works? https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/windows-10-will-restrict-data-access-to-authorized-apps-to-combat-ransomware/
2017-07-04T16:24:12 <colinclark> It looks like the default folders that are protected by Windows Defender are ones that largely contain user content, like photos and documents, which makes sense

2017-07-04T18:55:54 <Justin_o> kasparne_: hello, do you happen to know anything about options merging for arrays
2017-07-04T18:57:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: perhaps you may know actually ^
2017-07-04T18:57:59 <colinclark> I\'m not sure what I know :)
2017-07-04T18:58:12 <colinclark> Is there a problem you\'re encountering?
2017-07-04T18:58:36 <Justin_o> colinclark:  do you know what is expected to happen for options merging of arrays
2017-07-04T19:01:43 <colinclark> I can tell you empirical observations :)
2017-07-04T19:02:08 <Justin_o> okay
2017-07-04T19:03:30 <colinclark> First, you could use the "replace" merge policy to just straight-up replace one array with another
2017-07-04T19:03:50 <colinclark> otherwise, it seems that Infusion will do its best to try to merge the values of the array
2017-07-04T19:04:22 <colinclark> so for example, if your default value is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and you override it with [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], you\'ll get the latter array
2017-07-04T19:05:04 <colinclark> whereas if you override it with [5, 6, 7], you\'ll replace the first three values and retain the default values for the latter two
2017-07-04T19:05:17 <colinclark> [5, 6, 7, 4, 5]
2017-07-04T19:06:36 <colinclark> does that help, Justin_o? :)
2017-07-04T19:07:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, that\'s what i\'m seeing now... although i remember before it would always replace.. the issue i\'m running into is exactly the latter case where a shorter array is trying to override a longer one
2017-07-04T19:07:42 <colinclark> yeah, it sounds like you\'ll want to specify "replace" for your merge policy for that array option
2017-07-04T19:07:56 <colinclark> fluid.defaults("my.cat", { gradeNames: "fluid.component", catArray: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]});
2017-07-04T19:08:03 <colinclark> fluid.defaults("my.cat", { gradeNames: "fluid.component", catArray: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]});
2017-07-04T19:08:07 <colinclark> ooops
2017-07-04T19:08:13 <colinclark> var anotherCat = my.cat({mergePolicy: {catArray: "replace"}, catArray: [100, 99, 98]});
2017-07-04T19:08:35 <colinclark> like that, pasted from my browser console :)
2017-07-04T19:09:38 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, i\'ll do that.. i suppose that how i remembered things working made it harder to track down, but in my case the shorter array was a subset of the longer one, which made it quite tricky to trace the reason for
2017-07-04T19:09:48 <colinclark> yes, I can imagine!
2017-07-04T19:10:00 <colinclark> it must have looked like the array wasn\'t being merged at all
2017-07-04T19:10:11 <Justin_o> yes exactly
2017-07-04T19:10:41 <colinclark> we should probably file an issue against the documentation for this, since I did notice that the
2017-07-04T19:10:52 <colinclark> Options Merging section didn\'t really describe this behaviour
2017-07-04T19:12:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: makes sense.. i\'ll write one up
2017-07-04T19:12:56 <colinclark> thanks

2017-07-04T19:19:52 <colinclark> cool, Justin_o
2017-07-04T19:29:03 <gtirloni> just a heads up I\'m proposing some changes that range from transparent to breaking for a few components, it\'s related to my work on unblocking Kasper\'s PR and modernizing our containers --- I\'d appreciate any feedback and reviews of those PRs

2017-07-04T19:29:40 <gtirloni> I have other changes stashed for the config files but they depend on these (specially Kettle\'s)
2017-07-04T19:31:32 <colinclark> you\'re on a roll, gtirloni
2017-07-04T19:32:37 <gtirloni> lots of moving parts, but i think it\'s coming together now
2017-07-04T19:36:35 <colinclark> that\'s awesome
