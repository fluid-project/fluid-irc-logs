2017-03-17T12:24:35 <jhernandez> stegru: hola
2017-03-17T12:24:54 <stegru> javjarfer: :*
2017-03-17T12:25:21 <javjarfer> stegru, hi!
2017-03-17T12:25:40 <stegru> oh, sorry i didn\'t mean to say your name
2017-03-17T12:25:44 <stegru> hi jhernandez
2017-03-17T12:25:55 <javjarfer> stegru, np! :)
2017-03-17T12:25:56 <stegru> but hello anyway :)
2017-03-17T12:26:09 <jhernandez> javjarfer: sorry, but stegru only has eyes for me :P
2017-03-17T12:26:27 <stegru> but i do have 2 eyes ;)
2017-03-17T12:26:36 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2017-03-17T12:27:30 <javjarfer> stegru, jhernandez hahahaha xD
2017-03-17T12:27:52 <jhernandez> stegru: just commented on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2334 - perUser didn\'t do the trick
2017-03-17T12:28:30 <stegru> that\'s a shame
2017-03-17T12:28:35 <jhernandez> it is
2017-03-17T12:29:19 <jhernandez> and it seems to me that the way to go should be by applying write permissions to the folder
2017-03-17T12:30:30 <stegru> yes, i agree
2017-03-17T12:31:49 <jhernandez> okay, I\'ll do that - after figuring out how this is done with Wix
2017-03-17T12:34:35 <stegru> jhernandez: icacls is sort of like a chmod/chown
2017-03-17T12:35:52 <jhernandez> yes, I\'ve taken a look at that but I prefer to follow the wix way first
2017-03-17T12:38:19 <jhernandez> this is by using the PermissionEx utility
2017-03-17T12:39:16 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-03-17T12:39:25 <jhernandez> if I can\'t get it to work then I\'ll consider to add such custom action to execute icacls at the end of the installation
2017-03-17T12:45:06 <stegru> ahh ok

2017-03-17T13:01:17 <michelled> alanharnum: are you able to be at the office on March 27 and 28 in case we need to do some demos for the OER folks?
2017-03-17T13:01:33 <michelled> I\'m guessing it won\'t be formal but will be likely that people will drop by
2017-03-17T13:10:50 * jhung joined the channel
2017-03-17T13:14:09 <alanharnum> michelled: hey - yes, that should be no problem
2017-03-17T13:14:29 <michelled> excellent!
2017-03-17T13:16:49 <alanharnum> michelled: by then we should have (hopefully) the Nexus science lab stuff more demo-polished
2017-03-17T13:16:53 <alanharnum> along with all our other things
2017-03-17T13:16:55 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-03-17T13:17:33 <michelled> yeah, it\'s hard to pick these days what to show off :)
2017-03-17T13:17:38 <michelled> that\'s a great problem to have
2017-03-17T13:22:35 <alanharnum> well we\'ll make lliskovoi\'s sensor piano at some point and be able to do the music / science lab demo at same time
2017-03-17T13:22:36 <alanharnum> EFFICIENCY
2017-03-17T13:22:39 <alanharnum> INNOVATION
2017-03-17T13:23:07 <michelled> hahaha
2017-03-17T13:23:27 <simonjb> synergy!
2017-03-17T13:24:53 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I wonder what all my weird ferments sound like
2017-03-17T13:25:36 <alanharnum> I do think we should do the coffee test at some point
2017-03-17T13:25:53 <alanharnum> same grind with different brew methods would be interesting
2017-03-17T13:26:04 <alanharnum> does the aeropress claim to low acidity bear out, CHEMICALLY?
2017-03-17T13:26:36 <michelled> this makes me miss the best part about elementary school - science fair!
2017-03-17T13:26:51 <michelled> we might need bristol board
2017-03-17T13:27:12 <alanharnum> my one science fair participation was about dinosaur extinction
2017-03-17T13:27:36 <alanharnum> no real experiment done, but I did have a "dinosaur dance" I did at the end while singing a song about dinosaur extinction theory I found in a book
2017-03-17T13:27:47 <michelled> OMG! We need that!
2017-03-17T13:27:48 <alanharnum> this is what science fairs look like at alternative schools
2017-03-17T13:28:39 <michelled> I got kicked out of regionals because I did one on acid rain which involved killing some fish. I now completely agree with kicking me out - but growing up in farm country it seemed completely reasonable.
2017-03-17T13:34:00 <alanharnum> hey I found it: http://weesing.com/songSheets/lyricLearnDinosaurs.pdf (last page)

2017-03-17T14:53:24 <jhung> colinclark: I\'ve uploaded the code to the BIG IDeA WP theme to my repo. You can see the comparison to the original branch here: https://github.com/Automattic/_s/compare/master...jhung:foundation?expand=1
2017-03-17T14:53:54 <jhung> There\'s still work to be done, but it should give you a general idea of what was done to the original code base.
2017-03-17T14:54:22 <colinclark> ooh, awesome, thanks jhung
2017-03-17T14:54:24 <colinclark> I\'ll take a look
2017-03-17T14:56:31 <jhung> thanks colinclark
2017-03-17T14:56:50 <colinclark> hey simonjb, are you in the office today?
2017-03-17T15:00:49 <simonjb> yes colinclark, I\'m in the office
2017-03-17T15:01:28 <colinclark> does it feel like a sushi burrito day to you at all?
2017-03-17T15:01:55 <alanharnum> I found this really interesting as a historical overview of the accessibility APIs: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/
2017-03-17T15:02:14 <simonjb> colinclark: very much so, the sun is shining, the birds are singing
2017-03-17T15:02:21 <colinclark> what a coincidence!
2017-03-17T15:02:23 <colinclark> me too!
2017-03-17T15:02:40 <simonjb> :)
