2017-12-04T15:38:56 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni__@amatas and others, I just noticed that the latest fedora VM is using npm@5.
2017-12-04T15:40:07 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: annnd, is that good or bad?
2017-12-04T15:40:16 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s bad.
2017-12-04T15:40:23 <the-t-in-rtf> npm@5 doesn\'t work for various of our repos.
2017-12-04T15:40:31 <amatas> which version should be used?
2017-12-04T15:40:38 <the-t-in-rtf> npm@3, AFAIK
2017-12-04T15:40:56 <the-t-in-rtf> We will of course eventually need to upgrade, but both yarn and npm@5 currently have problems.
2017-12-04T15:43:14 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: which Vagrant definition are you using?
2017-12-04T15:43:55 <the-t-in-rtf> This is in an infusion pull I\'m working on that uses whatever\'s in master at the moment.
2017-12-04T15:44:17 <the-t-in-rtf> looks like fedora27
2017-12-04T15:46:45 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: the Vagrantfile used in the infusion project uses an Ansible role to install nodejs, and it seems to install the "lts" version: https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L8
2017-12-04T15:47:12 <the-t-in-rtf> We should discuss in the next meeting, as lots of our packages aren\'t ready for npm@5.
2017-12-04T15:47:20 <amatas> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml#L7
2017-12-04T15:47:39 <amatas> that variable can override the version used by the Ansible role
2017-12-04T15:47:45 <the-t-in-rtf> or at least those that depend on a copule of ones I know that are a problem, like leveldown (affects lots of people) and sharp (affects only me)
2017-12-04T15:48:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Overriding it is nice, but we should still discuss in the meeting.
2017-12-04T15:49:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I think it\'s a bigger issue for gpii-pouchdb and anything that uses gpii-pouchdb in node tests.
2017-12-04T15:49:20 <amatas> sure, add it to the agenda items then
2017-12-04T15:49:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Yup.
2017-12-04T15:55:21 <jhung> hi colinclark, I have a licensing question for you.
2017-12-04T16:02:05 <simonjb> hi there gtirloni__ is now still good for you to chat nexus packaging?
2017-12-04T16:02:13 <gtirloni__> simonjb: yes
2017-12-04T16:02:27 <simonjb> awesome, shall we chat on vidyo?
2017-12-04T16:03:01 <gtirloni__> cool, can we use your room? then i can join through webrtc

2017-12-04T16:51:04 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf, amatas: this is the issue about npm5 https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2673
2017-12-04T16:51:09 <jhernandez> feel free to add any comments
2017-12-04T16:51:44 <jhernandez> we also talked about that a few arch meetings ago
2017-12-04T16:53:04 <jhernandez> we can use new node lts but we need to use npm < 5 (until the switch to npm 5 is viable for us)
2017-12-04T16:53:15 <jhernandez> stegru: you around?
2017-12-04T16:55:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Whew.  I thought I had missed a meeting or something and that npm@5 was now fine.
2017-12-04T16:56:56 <stegru> yes?
2017-12-04T17:01:25 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'ve got something that I\'m sure you\'ll love
2017-12-04T17:01:38 <stegru> i bet you have, jhernandez :D
2017-12-04T17:01:39 <jhernandez> (and your hate to ms may be increased)
2017-12-04T17:01:41 <jhernandez> xD
2017-12-04T17:01:43 <jhernandez> so
2017-12-04T17:01:50 <jhernandez> I\'m using the last version of windows
2017-12-04T17:01:57 <stegru> oh god
2017-12-04T17:02:04 <jhernandez> it\'s called falls creators update or something like that?
2017-12-04T17:02:08 <jhernandez> it doesn\'t matter the name
2017-12-04T17:02:08 <stegru> yes
2017-12-04T17:02:23 * avtar joined the channel
2017-12-04T17:02:26 <jhernandez> the thing is that you key-in with a user that uses dpi scale
2017-12-04T17:02:38 <stegru> ok
2017-12-04T17:02:45 <jhernandez> and when you key out, the system doesn\'t get restored
2017-12-04T17:02:56 <stegru> that\'s a shame
2017-12-04T17:03:24 <jhernandez> I went to the "scaling factor" thing to manually change it and I found that I can\'t even restore the scaling factor back to its original state
2017-12-04T17:04:09 <stegru> can\'t change it back to 100%?
2017-12-04T17:04:12 <jhernandez> nope
2017-12-04T17:04:22 <stegru> well, that\'s strange
2017-12-04T17:04:27 <stegru> on a vm?
2017-12-04T17:04:59 <jhernandez> I\'m getting the message "a custom scale factor is set. turn off custom scale factor and log out"
2017-12-04T17:05:33 <jhernandez> yes, on a vm BUT not with our vagrant box
2017-12-04T17:06:05 <jhernandez> I\'m on a windows vm that I set up with parallels desktop (that virtualisation apple thing)
2017-12-04T17:06:08 <stegru> ah yes, I\'ve just done the same - I set the "custom scaling" to 100%, then the drop down goes grey
2017-12-04T17:06:34 <jhernandez> yup
2017-12-04T17:07:23 <stegru> do the unit tests pass?
2017-12-04T17:07:31 <jhernandez> I\'m getting this behavior on this parallels vm, not on our vagrant box
2017-12-04T17:07:46 <jhernandez> I got the gpii running with the installer
2017-12-04T17:07:52 <stegru> yes, i know what you mean
2017-12-04T17:07:54 <jhernandez> but I assume they won\'t pass
2017-12-04T17:08:43 <jhernandez> of course, I\'m in the middle of setting up everything so I can run tests, etc
2017-12-04T17:09:16 <kavya> jhernandez: Hi Javi, this issue you found on latest build with PSP which is out on friday?
2017-12-04T17:09:22 <jhernandez> kavya: right
2017-12-04T17:09:46 <jhernandez> and probably you\'re experiencing the same on the fresh parallels vm that you created yourself, isn\'t it?
2017-12-04T17:10:41 * gtirloni__ is now known as gtirloni
2017-12-04T17:10:46 <kavya> no..i have not identified any issues with dpi snapsets when keyed out
2017-12-04T17:11:09 <kavya> that worked fine on fresh parallels machine.
2017-12-04T17:12:48 <jhernandez> kavya: well, I\'m only experiencing this on a fresh windows parallels vm
2017-12-04T17:13:53 <jhernandez> (which comes with the last windows updates)
2017-12-04T17:14:39 <kavya> ok..
2017-12-04T17:16:19 <jhernandez> it\'s windows 10 home single language, version 1709, OS build 16299.15
2017-12-04T17:16:52 <jhernandez> I\'m curious, which versions are you both running on? kavya and stegru ^
2017-12-04T17:17:57 <jhernandez> stegru: is there any substantial difference between home and pro editions that may cause this?
2017-12-04T17:18:41 <gtirloni> jhernandez: hi, maybe the parallels version is getting confused by the new high dpi stuff in win10? do you have v13?
2017-12-04T17:19:54 <jhernandez> gtirloni: v13?
2017-12-04T17:19:57 <jhernandez> what do you mean?
2017-12-04T17:20:02 <gtirloni> parallels 13
2017-12-04T17:20:05 <jhernandez> oh
2017-12-04T17:20:21 <jhernandez> yes
2017-12-04T17:21:26 <jhernandez> it\'s my first time using parallels, so I\'m not aware of parallels-specific issues
2017-12-04T17:23:08 <jhernandez> I can try to upgrade my vagrant box to that version of windows and check whether it happens the same
2017-12-04T17:24:29 <gtirloni> i think that will probably break everything :)
2017-12-04T17:24:39 <gtirloni> amatas: is our vagrant box based on win10 1709 or 1703?
2017-12-04T17:25:07 <amatas> I think that is still on 1703
2017-12-04T17:25:30 <gtirloni> ok thanks
2017-12-04T17:26:50 * amatas has quit
2017-12-04T17:27:29 <gtirloni> jhernandez: i don\'t have a mac or parallels here.. but maybe there\'s some VM setting for choosing how high dpi scaling is done \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf
2017-12-04T17:28:31 <jhernandez> gtirloni: well, apparently, Gregg was having such problem on a real pc

2017-12-04T17:32:26 <jhernandez> that\'s why I was asking kavya and stegru about the windows version
2017-12-04T17:33:42 <jhernandez> although I have several pcs here, my ability to test different versions of windows is, let\'s say .. slow
2017-12-04T17:50:47 * sgithens joined the channel
2017-12-04T17:54:33 <amatas> gtirloni: confirmed: 1703
2017-12-04T17:55:00 <amatas> I found the url to the new iso, I\'m going to trigger a new build using this image and see what happends
