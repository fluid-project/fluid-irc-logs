2017-10-20T20:42:39 <clown> my guess is:  the browser \'onchange\' event is not firing the first time, but I\'m at loss as to why that would be
2017-10-20T20:43:05 <clown> when in fact the select value changed.
2017-10-20T20:46:10 <gmoss> perhaps we\'ll never know.... :]
2017-10-20T20:46:53 <clown> well, I\'m still reviewing the basics about select elements and their events to see if that triggers any of the things I tore my hair out over, all those years ago.
2017-10-20T20:48:10 <clown> dumb question:  the value in your test case *is* a change, not a "change" from the current value and then immediately back to that value?
2017-10-20T20:50:41 <gmoss> the selected indexes are different, and the value of the option at selected index is not the same. the change is indeed a change from one state to another, and not a net zero change as you describe

2017-10-20T20:54:08 <clown> gmoss, I\'m going to have to bail soon as I have a train to catch.  Sorry I\'m not much help here.
2017-10-20T20:54:24 <gmoss> clown: no worries, your assistance was appreciated! :)
2017-10-20T20:58:31 <gmoss> a little closer, maybe: when I manually register an event handler for .change on that element, it won\'t always fire
2017-10-20T21:01:09 <clown> very strange:  that\'s equivalent to calling "addListener()" or just adding a straight "onchange" attribute to the select and having the listener ignored.
2017-10-20T21:01:35 <clown> but only  the first time the value is changed.
2017-10-20T21:01:38 <clown> gahhh
2017-10-20T21:04:04 <clown> okay, bye gmoss (and fluid-everyone).  Have a nice weekend.
2017-10-20T21:04:25 <gmoss> bye, clown, and thanks once more for trying!

2017-10-20T21:12:18 <alanharnum> gmoss: do you have the code up somewhere I can check it out?
2017-10-20T21:12:48 <gmoss> alanharnum: let me double-check whether my latest remote has the bug present
2017-10-20T21:20:10 <gmoss> https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-storyTelling/tree/SJRK-13
2017-10-20T21:20:14 <gmoss> https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/SJRK/issues/SJRK-13?filter=allissues
2017-10-20T21:20:45 <gmoss> apologies if my documentation is sub-par, it was hasty
2017-10-20T21:29:59 <alanharnum> gmoss: OK, so you\'re logging both the select change event and the model change, correct?
2017-10-20T21:30:21 <alanharnum> I\'m seeing the model change not fire in the scenario describe, but the change event always seems to fire - is that the same thing you\'re seeing?
2017-10-20T21:30:31 <gmoss> alanharnum: that\'s correct. there\'s an onchange attribute on the select that I\'ve just added, as well as the model listener
2017-10-20T21:32:17 <gmoss> I see the change event not firing when text is entered in the input, but the model does change. then when i make a new choice in the select, it fires the change event but does not change the model
2017-10-20T21:33:13 <gmoss> (text entered in the input triggers a model relay that sets the value of the select to "other", which one would expect to fire the change event)

2017-10-20T21:38:06 <gmoss> alanharnum: okay, hopefully it\'s just something silly on my part. if you\'d like, I\'m available for a call
2017-10-20T21:38:24 <alanharnum> gmoss: yeah, let\'s hop on Vidyo quick, will probably be easier
2017-10-20T21:38:41 <alanharnum> I haven\'t solved the underlying problem BTW, I just have observations :p
2017-10-20T21:38:57 <gmoss> alanharnum: my room is open
2017-10-20T21:39:26 <alanharnum> gmoss: I am in your room! You aren\'t there!

2017-10-20T22:01:44 <Bosmon9> Hey there gmoss
2017-10-20T22:01:54 <gmoss> hi Bosmon9!
2017-10-20T22:01:58 <Bosmon9> How exactly are are you triggering the change in the state of the select control?
2017-10-20T22:01:59 * alanharnum has quit
2017-10-20T22:03:35 <gmoss> I\'ve just spoken with Alan about this, I was using a model relay to trigger the select control\'s initial state change, which was using the jQuery.val() to make the change (which doesn\'t fire the change event). subsequent changes to said select control are via a mouse click on my part
2017-10-20T22:04:02 <Bosmon9> Ah ok
2017-10-20T22:04:16 <Bosmon9> You should be aware that jQuery.val() in general is insufficient for this task
2017-10-20T22:04:22 <gmoss> I\'ve just got off a call with him, and the consensus seems to be that there\'s some weird interference happening on account of one of the model relays I have set up. On Monday I\'ll try to whip up a model listener that does the same thing as that relay
2017-10-20T22:04:45 <gmoss> duly noted, Bosmon9!
2017-10-20T22:04:45 <Bosmon9> But perhaps that isn\'t the issue
2017-10-20T22:04:54 <Bosmon9> You\'ve already discovered that jQuery.val() does not trigger an onchange notification
2017-10-20T22:04:59 <Bosmon9> So perhaps you already know all you need to know : P
2017-10-20T22:05:20 <gmoss> well the model was changing appropriately when the relay was being fired, that\'s not the problem we\'re facing. it was that the model wouldn\'t change when i manually chose a new option in the select
2017-10-20T22:05:43 <Bosmon9> Where in your code is the control in question?
2017-10-20T22:05:52 <gmoss> one moment please...
2017-10-20T22:06:14 <Bosmon9> I guess it is this stuff
2017-10-20T22:06:16 <Bosmon9> https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-storyTelling/blob/SJRK-13/src/js/storyTelling-story-storyEditor.js#L31
2017-10-20T22:06:17 <gmoss> src\\js\\storyTelling-story-storyEditor.js
2017-10-20T22:06:19 <Bosmon9> Dear oh dear!
2017-10-20T22:06:28 <gmoss> correct
2017-10-20T22:07:04 <Bosmon9> I\'m not surprised that something funny is happening : P
2017-10-20T22:09:42 <gmoss> Being a neophyte infusion user, I\'m not surprised either ;) I hope it isn\'t too painful for you
2017-10-20T22:09:54 <Bosmon9> Well, it\'s certainly ambitious....
2017-10-20T22:10:05 <Bosmon9> I thought long and hard before putting priority fields in modelRelay rules...
2017-10-20T22:10:44 <Bosmon9> But there\'s just too much going on here
2017-10-20T22:11:23 <Bosmon9> Priorities are only meaningful when they arbitrate between two rules going in the same direction
2017-10-20T22:11:30 <Bosmon9> Whereas here you have several rules going in various directions....
2017-10-20T22:12:34 <Bosmon9> So, this first rule sets "languageFromSelect" to "other" ALL THE TIME ....
2017-10-20T22:13:07 <Bosmon9> At least, it tries to do it whenever the input value changes....
2017-10-20T22:13:18 <gmoss> oh, even if languageFromInput has not changed?
2017-10-20T22:13:20 <gmoss> ah yes
2017-10-20T22:15:57 <Bosmon9> Then you have a rule which sets "language" to the first out of languageFromInput and languageFromSelect which is defined....
2017-10-20T22:16:52 <Bosmon9> I guess it is the 2nd rule which is the most dodgy
2017-10-20T22:17:00 <Bosmon9> Which attempts to both write and read languageFromInput
2017-10-20T22:17:08 <Bosmon9> And also contains a nested transform
2017-10-20T22:17:34 <Bosmon9> I know what you are going to say...
2017-10-20T22:17:47 <gmoss> indeed, it\'s pretty messy. the end goal is to have either what it is the drop-down as the final stored value, unless \'other\' is selected in which case it\'s what\'s entered into the text box.
2017-10-20T22:17:52 <Bosmon9> "If such a configuration isn\'t supported, why doesn\'t the framework give me an error!"
2017-10-20T22:18:03 <Bosmon9> And so I can only apologise
2017-10-20T22:18:21 <gmoss> *"it is" = "is in"
2017-10-20T22:18:28 <Bosmon9> But in general whether nested transforms are supported is unknown because noone has done it and there are no test cases for such a thing
2017-10-20T22:19:07 <Bosmon9> So - some general notes - firstly, if you are using the latest framework, your excludeSource: "*" directives should be unnecessary since none of your transforms are invertible
2017-10-20T22:19:23 <gmoss> this nested transform seems to be working, as the input field is cleared out when expected
2017-10-20T22:19:23 <Bosmon9> secondly, if you do want to write such a thing, backwards: "never" is a bit more readable
2017-10-20T22:20:07 <Bosmon9> thirdly, the priorities that for rules that are mapping in the opposite direction will be ignored
2017-10-20T22:20:39 <Bosmon9> fourthly, if you want to leave a value unchanged, the standard idiom is to arrange for the transform to return `undefined` rather than to read the original value again and return it
2017-10-20T22:20:59 <Bosmon9> All of this together should at least make the definitions a bit more concise even if they don\'t resolve the problem
2017-10-20T22:21:47 <Bosmon9> Ironically though, I think to make this a bit safer you will need even MORE state in the model, and even more transforms....
2017-10-20T22:22:22 <Bosmon9> For example a boolean flag representing whether "other" is selected
2017-10-20T22:24:16 <gmoss> not the answer I expected, but I will certainly give that a try :) as well as your other recommendations
2017-10-20T22:24:44 <Bosmon9> I see a risk that your first rule will activate even when the value of "input" is being changed to ""
2017-10-20T22:27:26 <Bosmon9> Now you have a further debugging risk - I imagine that you put this listener in https://github.com/BlueSlug/sjrk-storyTelling/blob/SJRK-13/src/js/storyTelling-story-storyEditor.js#L85 in order to debug the action of your relay rules
2017-10-20T22:27:41 <Bosmon9> But unfortunately this will always act too late to be able to observe any of the relay rules operating
2017-10-20T22:27:43 <gmoss> that\'s correct
2017-10-20T22:27:58 <Bosmon9> Listeners only get to see the final value of a resolve model once all relay rules have activated and the model has settled to a consistent value
2017-10-20T22:28:02 <Bosmon9> resolve -> resolved
2017-10-20T22:28:27 <Bosmon9> So the only way you will be able to observe the process is to write your own relay rule in a custom function and do the logging in there
2017-10-20T22:28:48 <Bosmon9> Now it seems that you need such a rule in your first rule anyway
2017-10-20T22:29:04 <gmoss> ah, so even if changes are happening, the listener won\'t do its job unless the state has actually experienced a net changed?
2017-10-20T22:29:11 <gmoss> *change
2017-10-20T22:29:14 <Bosmon9> Since it needs to be a function which returns "other" if the input is not "", and returns undefined otherwise
2017-10-20T22:29:24 <Bosmon9> Although you could actually do this with a valueMapper
2017-10-20T22:29:28 <Bosmon9> gmoss - yes, exactly
2017-10-20T22:29:47 <Bosmon9> If at the end of total relay resolution there has been no overall change in the model value you are listening to, you will not get a notification
2017-10-20T22:30:00 <Bosmon9> Relays appear to happen "instantaneously" from the point of view of listeners
2017-10-20T22:30:15 <Bosmon9> They are really for constraint satisfaction, not for reaction and processing
2017-10-20T22:30:15 <gmoss> gotcha
2017-10-20T22:30:34 <Bosmon9> And this is why it was such a design risk for me to put priorities in, but unfortunately a situation came up where it seemed unavoidable
2017-10-20T22:30:55 <Bosmon9> But in practice, priorities are only relevant where there are two rules which might activate based on the SAME piece of source state
2017-10-20T22:31:02 <Bosmon9> And the priority then selects which rules activates first
2017-10-20T22:31:13 <Bosmon9> rules -> rule
2017-10-20T22:32:30 <Bosmon9> So yes, if you want to tinker with or observe relay resolution, you will have to write something in a relay - perhaps via flud.transforms.free or some other custom function
2017-10-20T22:32:46 <Bosmon9> flud -> fluid, sorry I am typing on an unfamiliar laptop : P
2017-10-20T22:33:22 <gmoss> not to worry :) yes I may try just that, possibly in some combination with Alan\'s suggestion that we try to move that logic to a modelListener
2017-10-20T22:33:53 <Bosmon9> Well, I think what you\'ve done is right and noble and intent, even if it looks a bit horrific when I see it all written out like this : P
2017-10-20T22:35:06 <Bosmon9> We REALLY need the expression parser written up in https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5894
2017-10-20T22:35:48 <Bosmon9> Anyway, hopefully these are enough pointers to let you fathom what is going on
2017-10-20T22:36:17 <Bosmon9> Let me know if you discover the framework doing something that doesn\'t make sense given these points
2017-10-20T22:37:00 <Bosmon9> I\'d try to rewrite your first rule using the valueMapper and do the various other tidyings
2017-10-20T22:37:02 <gmoss> yes I think it\'s very helpful, and gives me a bit to chew on! I think I\'m hitting the end of my usable brain power for the day (knowing what time it is for you makes this seem laughable)
2017-10-20T22:37:50 <Bosmon9> Well, it\'s true I shouldn\'t be here, I\'m just up in Cambridge trying to move out another carload of stuff, but I couldn\'t resist installing an IRC client on this spare laptop to see if anything was going on : P
2017-10-20T22:39:02 <gmoss> lucky for me :)
2017-10-20T22:39:17 <Bosmon9> Yeah, maybe lucky, or maybe not... : P
2017-10-20T22:39:35 <Bosmon9> I worry about your 3rd rule too
2017-10-20T22:39:52 <Bosmon9> You could try writing that literally in code as a free transform to see if it clears things up
2017-10-20T22:40:12 <Bosmon9> Since the relay system isn\'t really rated to deal with compound transforms (although as you find it might succeed in some cases)
2017-10-20T22:40:20 <Bosmon9> And that would also be a useful place to stick a debugging statement
2017-10-20T22:42:21 <Bosmon9> Your 2nd rule should also be expressed with the valueMapper too, I think
2017-10-20T22:42:33 <gmoss> okay, sure, I\'ll give both of those a shot :)
2017-10-20T22:43:13 <Bosmon9> Good luck, I\'ll see you on the day dawning....

2017-10-20T19:36:23 <Bosmon9> Hi there cindyli - it would be great if you could take a look at another small framework pull :)
2017-10-20T19:36:26 <Bosmon9> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/855
2017-10-20T19:36:36 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon9
2017-10-20T19:40:30 <Bosmon9> Thanks so much :)
2017-10-20T19:53:45 <cindyli> Bosmon9: is this another issue that alanharnum and gmoss ran into?
2017-10-20T19:59:54 <gmoss> cindyli: this doesn\'t look familiar to me, after reviewing the JIRA. I\'d wait of alanharnum to confirmm though
2017-10-20T19:59:56 <gmoss> *confirm,
2017-10-20T20:00:11 <cindyli> ok. thanks, gmoss
2017-10-20T20:01:12 <gmoss> *of = for
2017-10-20T20:01:17 <gmoss> no problem, cindyli!
2017-10-20T20:05:59 * simonjb has quit
2017-10-20T20:06:54 <Bosmon9> cindyli - this was an issue I ran into whem implementing "embranglements"
2017-10-20T20:07:06 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2017-10-20T20:07:13 <Bosmon9> Although I have a feeling that simonjb reported a very similar issue when he was working on the co-occurrence engine for the Nexus
2017-10-20T20:07:34 <Bosmon9> Since he would have had to write a very similar definition for a dynamic component with directly specified subcomponents...
2017-10-20T20:16:32 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I\'m dealing with a very intriguing problem at the moment. Has anyone ever experienced a case where a select element which is hooked up to a component\'s model value via gpii-binder did *not* effect a model change even though the DOM and the selectedIndex changed?
2017-10-20T20:18:46 <clown> gmoss:  trying to understand \xe2\x80\x94 something changed the select and you are expecting the fluid model to change.  That is the cause is a change in the selecct, and the result is seen in the model?
2017-10-20T20:19:51 <gmoss> clown: in this case, I\'m changing the select myself, and I\'m expecting the fluid model to change. the model, in some cases, is not changing.
2017-10-20T20:20:21 <clown> gmoss, right so the flow of information is from a selecct change to the model.
2017-10-20T20:20:28 <clown> next question:
2017-10-20T20:20:30 <gmoss> clown: correct
2017-10-20T20:20:48 <clown> how is a change in a select detected by anything, let alone gpii?
2017-10-20T20:21:43 <gmoss> clown: i\'m using gpii-binder to bind the dom element to the fluid model: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-binder
2017-10-20T20:23:00 * clown looks, while trying to remeber how the select element works in general
2017-10-20T20:24:04 * gmoss is reading the jQuery .change() function doc, since apparently gpii-binder uses that
2017-10-20T20:24:16 <clown> noting this from the readme:  "\xe2\x80\xa6 you directly set the element\'s value, but only when you have updated the value using browser events and change focus."
2017-10-20T20:24:57 * clown can\'t remember what the browser event is for a select when it changes value.
2017-10-20T20:25:47 <gmoss> clown: indeed, I was just poring over that very line... the funny thing is that this "error" is happening only on the first attempt to select a new item in the drop-down. the second attempt is always successful
2017-10-20T20:26:08 <clown> ah a clue!
2017-10-20T20:26:16 * amatas has quit
2017-10-20T20:26:39 <gmoss> so I\'m wondering what difference there is between the first and second attempt. i\'ve tried changing focus to see if that helped, but it did not
2017-10-20T20:27:00 * clown vague memory that change events on select elements were different on different browsers.
2017-10-20T20:27:15 <gmoss> clown: indeed. I\'m able to reproduce this issue quite reliably, in fact, and I\'ve added a test to capture it.
2017-10-20T20:28:45 <gmoss> I\'ve also been able to reproduce this in Firefox and Chrome
2017-10-20T20:29:12 <gmoss> I feel a bit stymied by this one
2017-10-20T20:31:39 <clown> well, I know nothing about the gpii.binder.  But I have worked with select elements in the past, and tore out some hair in the process of getting them to work right.  I\'m still trying to remember what the tricky bits were, and looking up the basicx again.
2017-10-20T20:32:18 <clown> *basics, where that means:  "how do you deal with select elements changeing in just plain vanilla JS"?
2017-10-20T20:34:06 <gmoss> clown: in the interest of preventing hair loss, it would be great if you recall any of the specifics!
2017-10-20T20:34:27 <clown> oh, it grows back.  eventually
2017-10-20T20:34:37 <clown> and repression is a good thing from time to time.
2017-10-20T20:35:51 * cindyli has quit
2017-10-20T20:36:01 <clown> here\'s one thing \xe2\x80\x94 there is (was?) a difference between keyboard vs. mouse in terms of when the onchange event occurred.  Is that difference important to your case?
2017-10-20T20:36:26 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-10-20T20:37:16 <gmoss> clown: let me test it out using a keyboard and see if that makes a difference. it certainly doesn\'t make a difference to jqUnit
2017-10-20T20:37:45 <clown> Here\'s another one:  select elements are implemented as comboboxes in FireFox but as menus in Chrome and Safari.  Does that matter?
2017-10-20T20:38:24 <gmoss> keyboard manipulation of the ui yields the same result
2017-10-20T20:38:40 <clown> okay, it\'s not that then.
2017-10-20T20:39:44 <gmoss> i had suspected it could be related to the modelRelays I have hooked into this component, but that still doesn\'t explain why the modelListener won\'t fire sometimes
2017-10-20T20:39:57 <gmoss> or at least it\'s not evident to me why that would be the case
2017-10-20T20:40:24 <clown> hence your initial question.
