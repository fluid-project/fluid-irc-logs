2017-07-06T08:57:52 <the-t-in-rtf> That universal PR was merged so quickly I thought it was a bug.
2017-07-06T08:59:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, thanks @kasparnet and @Bosmon7 for the quick attention, really happy to get this one out of the way.
2017-07-06T09:01:05 <the-t-in-rtf> crap, I see now that that was the previous pull, please ignore.

2017-07-06T14:06:36 <stegru> amatas: do you script your windows vm builds? I want to do: "make-a-vm windows10.iso"
2017-07-06T14:06:57 <amatas> yes stegru
2017-07-06T14:07:09 <amatas> all the windows vms are built by the CI
2017-07-06T14:07:24 <amatas> https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows
2017-07-06T14:07:25 <stegru> installed from the iso?
2017-07-06T14:07:31 <amatas> yes
2017-07-06T14:07:44 <stegru> nice one!
2017-07-06T14:07:48 <amatas> the iso is downloaded and used for the installer
2017-07-06T14:07:56 <amatas> installation*
2017-07-06T14:08:04 <amatas> you only need packer-io
2017-07-06T14:08:32 <amatas> https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/blob/master/windows_10_x86_apps.json#L106
2017-07-06T14:08:40 <amatas> it downloads the iso directly from M$
2017-07-06T14:08:50 <stegru> ah
2017-07-06T14:09:05 <amatas> https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L29
2017-07-06T14:09:18 <stegru> yes, this is just what i want
2017-07-06T14:09:19 <amatas> that is the command line to run the build
2017-07-06T14:10:31 <stegru> about 20 years ago, it was my job to install windows. I had 8 connected to a KVM, and i could literally install NT4 with my eyes closed
2017-07-06T14:10:52 <amatas> hehe good times
2017-07-06T14:10:52 <stegru> i\'ll give this to my younger self
2017-07-06T14:11:39 <amatas> yup, in fact you can now put all that stuff in a USB drive and install all your stuff with only one step.
2017-07-06T14:17:09 <stegru> failed at the first hurdle.. downloaded arm64 packer ;)
2017-07-06T14:25:05 <amatas> :)
2017-07-06T14:27:36 <gloob> ready for your pine
2017-07-06T14:29:12 <amatas> :D I just searched if the rpi\'s processor is 32 or 64 bits

2017-07-06T15:24:16 <Bosmon3> So, michelled -
2017-07-06T15:24:43 <Bosmon3> Referring to the code at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Testing.js#L285
2017-07-06T15:25:12 <Bosmon3> Right now the framework is limited to only being able to see components at construct time that already exist
2017-07-06T15:25:26 <Bosmon3> Which pretty much limits you to seeing only your parent components or their immediate siblings
2017-07-06T15:25:56 <Bosmon3> A lot depends on how early you need to see the app
2017-07-06T15:26:13 <Bosmon3> YOu can always be sure that you can issue an IoCSS reference to the app using the selector {that gpii.app}
2017-07-06T15:26:17 <Bosmon3> You know it is "somewhere below you"
2017-07-06T15:28:39 <Bosmon3> I think I need to make a tweak to the IoC Testing Framework docs...
2017-07-06T15:28:58 <Bosmon3> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html
2017-07-06T15:49:39 <michelled> thanks Bosmon3

2017-07-06T16:28:50 <Bosmon3> Hi there gtirloni, gtirloni_ - for these times when we get a CI job failure, especially due to the infamous "cannot resolve fluid.tabbable" problem, is there some way we can get a snapshot of the filesystem of the VM before it is swept away, so we can try to make some kind of guess whether this is a build or a runtime problem?
2017-07-06T16:30:57 * gtirloni has quit
2017-07-06T16:31:03 <jhernandez> Bosmon3: hey there
2017-07-06T16:31:35 <gtirloni_> hi! we used to let those failed builds\' VMs to stay around but it turned out we had a lot of them, so we made the VM deletion mandatory... We\'d have to revert that and implement some kind of garbage collection process to reap those VMs
2017-07-06T16:32:04 <jhernandez> Bosmon3: do you want to have a quick meeting about the pcp api work? or do you just want to prefer to go through my WIP pull request?
2017-07-06T16:32:27 <jhernandez> (and provide comments in the pull request itself)
2017-07-06T16:43:44 <jhung> Justin_o, michelled, or colinclark: Do any of you have time to help me debug something on Lindsay\'s Creative Users site?
2017-07-06T16:44:14 <michelled> jhung: sure, do you want to chat?
2017-07-06T16:44:26 <jhung> Sure michelled. Vidyo?
2017-07-06T16:51:25 <gtirloni_> Bosmon3, opened GPII-2479 to address that (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2479)

2017-07-06T16:52:49 <Bosmon3> Hi there michelled - I made some improvements to our docs following our chat just now which should hopefully help you
