2017-04-03T14:30:26 <jhung> fluid-everyone: has anyone successfully used the FF WebIDE to debug FF on Android over USB on Mac?
2017-04-03T14:34:14 <clown> jhung, not me.
2017-04-03T14:34:44 <simonjb> no, sorry jhung
2017-04-03T14:35:36 <jhung> thanks. trying another method now.

2017-04-03T15:03:24 <jhung> fluid-everyone: If anyone ever needs it, you can debug FF on Android over WiFi (USB connection didn't work for me). I followed this guide here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Remote_Debugging/Debugging_Firefox_for_Android_over_Wifi
2017-04-03T15:04:34 <stegru> there is also an app to use adb over wifi, jhung
2017-04-03T15:05:01 <jhung> adb not needed stegru. It's done through the FF WebIDE interface.
2017-04-03T15:05:07 <jhung> *on desktop
2017-04-03T15:05:42 <jhung> I didn't have to install adb. I think that's only needed if you're working with older versions of FF (pre v32 I think)
2017-04-03T15:06:09 <stegru> ah right
