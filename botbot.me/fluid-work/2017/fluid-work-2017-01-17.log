2017-01-17T20:36:01 <alanharnum> Justin_o: FYI I've created & self-assigned this: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6114
2017-01-17T20:37:10 <alanharnum> per my discussion with the CDNJS maintainers
2017-01-17T20:38:41 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, do they want a single minified CSS file?
2017-01-17T20:38:53 <alanharnum> Justin_o: they're fine with individual files
2017-01-17T20:39:04 <alanharnum> they care less about concatentation than minification
2017-01-17T20:39:19 <Justin_o> alanharnum: okay, it's still an interesting case, i guess we can copy all the minified css into the assets directory
2017-01-17T20:39:22 <alanharnum> and they seem fine w/hosting full files, they just want there to be a minified option as well
2017-01-17T20:39:30 <Justin_o> not sure what to do about the stylus generated stuff though
2017-01-17T20:39:32 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I've got a mostly working branch
2017-01-17T20:39:46 <Justin_o> alanharnum: okay.. great
2017-01-17T20:41:00 <alanharnum> which is to say, it all works and produces minified CSS and JS, but has some ugly duplication that I'm refactoring out
2017-01-17T20:41:12 <Justin_o> alanharnum: cool
2017-01-17T20:41:18 <Justin_o> thanks for working on it
2017-01-17T20:41:43 <Justin_o> alanharnum: if it's possible to quickly get source maps working for the css files too, that'd be great

2017-01-17T14:24:24 <Khushil> Hey..Khushil here..I am making small app with Infusion. But I am stuck in one very trivial thing. I am using Randerer component for input field. I just want to multiply amount in input field with some other amount. I am using modelRelay and singleTransform for this as also given in Infusion tutorials. It renders on creating but do not
2017-01-17T14:24:24 <Khushil> triggering/re-triggering through modelListeners after that.Also this thing was not working as given in tutorials. I am using fluid_2_0_0 version. Any suggestion or tips ?

2017-01-17T14:35:07 <alanharnum> Khushil: great - if you put it on GitHub I can have a quick look
2017-01-17T14:47:41 <Khushil> https://github.com/KhushilMistry/Experiment_with_Infusion/blob/master/demos/inlineEdit/1.js here is the file link on which I am working on.

2017-01-17T15:02:58 <alanharnum> Khushil: it looks like the model relay isn\'t working - you probably have worked this out yourself from your logging. Trying to dig a little bit more and understand why.
2017-01-17T15:04:24 <alanharnum> you\'ve used the renderer properly, the issue is actually with the relay configuration
2017-01-17T15:04:38 <alanharnum> i always find these super-finicky myself, so have to dig to remember exactly how they work :p
2017-01-17T15:06:04 <Khushil> kk..Thanks..!! I am stuck with it from few days. I looked at tutorials but found same problem so thought that let me ask here..!! :)
2017-01-17T15:07:11 <Justin_o> Khushil, alanharnum: also you may not need to use the modelListener to trigger the refreshView.. I think the value binding in the prototree may take care of that.
2017-01-17T15:07:44 <alanharnum> Justin_o Khushil: yup, don\'t need the model listener
2017-01-17T15:09:40 <Khushil> Yeah. I read it in tutorials. I added it to print model in console for debugging purpose.

2017-01-17T15:23:43 <alanharnum> Khushil: I\'ve got to run to a meeting, but I think another issue is that input to the enter_amount field is being converted into a string on the model when the user changes it - this means it can\'t be used with the linearScale transform
2017-01-17T15:25:33 <Khushil> Okay..!! I will look at it..Thanks :)
2017-01-17T15:29:12 <alanharnum> Khushil: sorry to run with no explanation, but got it working in this fork: https://github.com/KhushilMistry/Experiment_with_Infusion/compare/master...waharnum:master
2017-01-17T15:29:21 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-01-17T15:29:38 <alanharnum> basically, need to use an intermediary model value to store the number as a string value, relay it to a number value
2017-01-17T15:30:11 <alanharnum> there\'s a more elegant way to do this than I did it, but that gives you a working example
2017-01-17T15:31:47 <Khushil> Yeah..Thanks..!! Its self explanatory..So no need for explanation. :)

2017-01-17T15:52:21 <colinclark> michelled: I filed this yesterday after a conversation with Gregg: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2235
2017-01-17T15:52:45 <michelled> thx colinclark
2017-01-17T15:52:55 <colinclark> stegru had some good ideas for how to solve it, and I did discover that Microsoft maintains a library for using their CreateMutex library from Node.js
2017-01-17T15:53:02 <colinclark> it looks pretty straightforward
2017-01-17T15:53:23 <colinclark> presumably we acquire a lock on a mutex named "gpii-app" or something along those lines
2017-01-17T15:53:33 <colinclark> at startup
2017-01-17T15:54:01 <colinclark> and then presumably bail out in any case where the mutex is already locked
2017-01-17T15:54:10 <colinclark> which implies that another instance of the app is running
2017-01-17T15:54:13 <stegru> yes, that;s it
2017-01-17T15:54:58 <colinclark> thanks for the suggestion, stegru
