2017-06-06T15:48:02 <colinclark> hey cindyli1 and Bosmon2, when you get a chance, can you move your slides into the "Charts Technical Meeting" folder, just so we have all our stuff for Thursday in one place?
2017-06-06T15:50:25 <cindyli1> colinclark: will do

2017-06-06T16:20:28 <colinclark> Bosmon7: I guess "charts" here must be an Americanism?
2017-06-06T16:20:30 <colinclark> It means "slides"
2017-06-06T16:21:41 <Bosmon7> Oh I see
2017-06-06T16:21:45 <Bosmon7> Is it one you recognise?
2017-06-06T16:22:02 <colinclark> only because i\'ve heard it used in practice a few times
2017-06-06T16:22:15 <Bosmon7> cindyli1 says she didn\'t put anything in this folder because she didn\'t understand what the title meant :)

2017-06-06T16:24:23 <cindyli1> i thought that folder was created for holding diagram kind of thing.. anyway, now i know what it\'s for
2017-06-06T16:24:31 <colinclark> no worries
2017-06-06T16:24:45 <colinclark> gtirloni: if you can move yours sometime, too, that\'d be awesome
2017-06-06T16:24:56 <colinclark> then my "charts" won\'t be so lonely

2017-06-06T17:29:53 <cindyli1> hi simonjb, there\'s a question about 2015 slides i wanted to ask u yesterday but forgot
2017-06-06T17:30:19 <cindyli1> on the page of "server deployment", there\'s a bullet point that says: Whitelist filtering of API endpoints
2017-06-06T17:30:22 <cindyli1> what does it mean?

2017-06-06T17:49:41 <simonjb> cindyli1: I think it was referring to firewalling the servers and only letting requests through for explicitly declared endpoints
2017-06-06T17:50:11 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2017-06-06T17:51:08 <simonjb> but server deployment is something that gtirloni would be better able to talk to
2017-06-06T17:52:02 <cindyli> ok thanks, simonjb.
