2017-07-07T14:23:30 <Bosmon3> gtirloni - seems that Docker for Windows is v10 only
2017-07-07T14:23:48 <Bosmon3> So you might need to enlist someone else to help out : P
2017-07-07T14:24:29 <Bosmon3> Ah, I can use "Docker Toolbox" ....
2017-07-07T14:25:02 <Bosmon3> Which will disable VirtualBox?!
2017-07-07T14:25:33 <Bosmon3> Ah no, that is Hyper-V....
2017-07-07T14:27:20 <gtirloni> yeah, so here\'s the background info on that
2017-07-07T14:27:50 <gtirloni> "Docker ToolBox" was Docker\'s first iteration where they used VirtualBox.. but it\'s been abandoned (they\'ve "donated" this to the community)
2017-07-07T14:28:39 <gtirloni> "Docker for Windows/Mac" is their new attempt at making it easier, but for us it causes a problem: they aren\'t using VBox anymore (citing many issues, which we can all relate).. and now they are using Hyper-V for Windows and xhyve for OSX
2017-07-07T14:29:26 <gtirloni> our CentOS vagrant box comes with Docker.. I think we should modify the Fedora box to be the same
2017-07-07T14:29:28 <amatas> perhaps you can simply use a Linux VM with a Docker on it, at the end is almost the same that the old Docker ToolBox.
2017-07-07T14:29:35 <gtirloni> amatas: yep
2017-07-07T14:30:04 <gtirloni> so if you `vagrant init inclusivedesign/centos7; vagrant up; vagrant ssh` you have Docker
2017-07-07T14:35:10 <gtirloni> as for why VBox vs. Hyper-V is a problem: you can\'t have two hypervisors running at the same time. There are tricks to have them both installed, and then you switch from one to the other, but it\'s a pain.. I wouldn\'t recommend that.
2017-07-07T14:36:01 <gtirloni> another alternative we considered was embracing multiple hypervisors (the best one for each platform) and supplying different Vagrant boxes for each of them.. but that would 3x our work and still... Hyper-V and xhyve management tools aren\'t very friendly to end users (compared to VBox). there wasn\'t much appeal
2017-07-07T14:37:58 <gtirloni> Bosmon3: thanks for reviewing and merging all these PRs :-)
2017-07-07T14:39:31 <gtirloni> Bosmon3: I just noticed I\'ve been working with a fork of Kettle.. and it broke down when I reinstalled universal because we\'re at kettle 1.5.0 there. just a heads up we may need a new release for those sweet resolvers
2017-07-07T14:46:28 <Bosmon3> gtirloni - but 1.6.0 including resolvers is already released
2017-07-07T14:47:11 <Bosmon3> odd, somehow I seem to have not committed it to git
2017-07-07T14:48:19 <Bosmon3> Ah, it\'s in tags
2017-07-07T14:48:20 <Bosmon3> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/1.6.0/History.md
2017-07-07T14:48:27 <gtirloni> oh my bad, now i see it... i was working with the files and an error led me to believe i was working with an outdated kettle (but it was my config that was broken, i got confused with a message from infusion about expanders)... somehow this got stuck in my brain, and not that the config file was broken. sorry
2017-07-07T14:48:47 <Bosmon3> It\'s not in master
2017-07-07T14:51:30 <gtirloni> npm is happy that it sees 1.6.0 in the registry.. it\'s all good I think, happy accident
2017-07-07T15:11:45 * pratik_r joined the channel
2017-07-07T15:16:23 <gtirloni> is there a preference between calling a env var that will tell the preferences server where couchdb? GPII_PREFERENCES_COUCHDB_URL vs GPII_PREFERENCES_DATASOURCE_URL ... I\'m wondering if I should go for the generic non-couchdb-specific name
2017-07-07T15:16:32 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-07-07T15:21:46 <amatas> +1 for the generic name
2017-07-07T15:22:04 <gtirloni> generic name is leading
