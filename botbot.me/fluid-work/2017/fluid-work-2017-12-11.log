2017-12-11T14:20:14 <Bosmon> Hey there Justin_o - I\'ve just been looking at the fluid.debounce tests with the-t-in-rtf
2017-12-11T14:20:20 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidJSTests.js#L316
2017-12-11T14:20:42 <Bosmon> I think that these timeouts are far too fine-grained - they should be in units of hundreds of ms, not handfuls
2017-12-11T14:21:00 <Bosmon> And especially on Windows in the "old world", timeouts of smaller than 13ms can\'t be resolved anyway
2017-12-11T14:21:17 <Bosmon> Do you think you could just prepare a tiny pull which multiplies them all by 100?
2017-12-11T14:40:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure.. is there a JIRA for that already?
2017-12-11T14:40:55 <Bosmon> Ah no, sorry ...
2017-12-11T14:41:16 <Bosmon> It\'s just referenced on the-t-in-rtf \'s pull
2017-12-11T14:41:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, would you like me to make a PR against his branch or master?
2017-12-11T14:41:58 <Bosmon> Against master would be good
2017-12-11T14:43:18 <Justin_o> okay, coming up
2017-12-11T14:43:44 <Bosmon> Awesome, thanks Justin_o!
2017-12-11T14:46:55 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, i\'m refactoring preferences server to get/set preferences from couchdb/pouchdb using the new data model - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences#Data_Model. right now, preferences server provides http endpoints for getting/setting preferences: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesServer.js#L28-L42
2017-12-11T14:47:47 <cindyli> do you think I should replace these unsecured endpoints with internal invokers
2017-12-11T14:48:06 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-12-11T14:48:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2017-12-11T14:48:42 <Bosmon> We created far, far too many HTTP endpoints in our initial designs of the GPII

2017-12-11T14:49:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s the PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/866
2017-12-11T14:49:51 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon.
2017-12-11T14:52:24 <cindyli> Bosmon, it seems the creation of new preferences (POST to /preferences) is not used by the flow manager. do you think I should remove this functionality until we have actual use cases?
2017-12-11T14:53:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - how do we propose provisioning new user tokens then?
2017-12-11T14:53:33 <Bosmon> I know those meetings are still in progress
2017-12-11T14:53:43 <Bosmon> BUt it sounds like that functionality might end up being used quite soon
2017-12-11T14:53:54 <cindyli> ok, will keep it

2017-12-11T16:54:19 <gmoss> Bosmon: thanks for your response on Friday night! I wasn\'t aware (or perhaps I forgot) that the IoC testing framework is unable to handle back-to-back actions, but it all makes sense. What\'s to keep the component around after there are no more listeners to it, right? I was able to get the test to run when listening for the changeEvent as long as the assertions were being made against the {testStory} component and
2017-12-11T16:54:19 <gmoss> not the {storySpeaker}. there is a further issue to do with {storySpeaker}\'s createOnEvent and the timing of the tests, so I\'ll keep plugging away at that.

2017-12-11T17:01:26 <colinclark> candidate arrived really late and so we\'re still going
2017-12-11T17:11:15 <colinclark> michelled: Can we do Skype? The vidyo client isn\'t working for me
2017-12-11T17:14:37 <Bosmon> gmoss - well, it does handle back to back actions, but just in the sense of being able to trigger them
2017-12-11T17:14:56 <Bosmon> It\'s just that its "foresight" that there is going to be a passive fixture coming up only extends to the last one
2017-12-11T17:15:30 <Bosmon> It\'s actually very good that this has come up, since there had been a long-standing task to fix the issue with back-to-back passive fixtures, and now it seems there is a closely analogous one with active ones
2017-12-11T17:15:44 <Bosmon> And so it would make sense for both rewrites to be done at once

The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records."
