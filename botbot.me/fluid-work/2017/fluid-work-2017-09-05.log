2017-09-05T15:04:10 <javjarfer> stegru, nice! Explain to mortals
2017-09-05T15:04:32 <gloob> seiously?
2017-09-05T15:04:36 <javjarfer> okay, the question was just in time
2017-09-05T15:04:53 <gloob> amazing
2017-09-05T15:04:58 <gloob> stegru: thanks!
2017-09-05T15:05:00 <javjarfer> single reference to System.Runtime?
2017-09-05T15:05:05 <stegru> i updated the target framework to 4.5.1 (that\'s what the VM has), it then complained about a reference to System.Runtime
2017-09-05T15:05:25 <javjarfer> cleanest fix, 3 lines xD
2017-09-05T15:05:40 <gloob> I updated the targetframework and changed the reference of system.runtime in source code not in the project definition :(

2017-09-05T15:12:34 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2017-09-05T15:13:37 <gloob> what I don\'t know is why we have 2015 and 2017 in the same vagrant machine, maybe we can lighten the iso a bit if we drop one of it (2015?)
2017-09-05T15:15:24 <stegru> is it really? I can only see 2015
2017-09-05T15:15:46 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-09-05T15:15:47 <stegru> just the build tools, not vs
2017-09-05T15:16:06 * kasparnet has quit
2017-09-05T15:17:30 <gloob> I guess we have buildtools of 2015 and 2017
2017-09-05T15:18:24 <stegru> not on my VM - there\'s only 2015, maybe you installed it?
2017-09-05T15:18:33 <stegru> or my vm is old
2017-09-05T15:18:47 <gloob> I\'m creating a new one, I will tell you
2017-09-05T15:20:08 <stegru> oh, yes.. i just checked a newer vm
2017-09-05T15:21:50 <gloob> yep, reconfirmed here, 200MB the 2017 thing
2017-09-05T15:22:06 <gloob> 1Gb the vs 14.0
2017-09-05T15:22:41 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-09-05T15:23:05 <gloob> I think is because it is included (vs 2017) in the original windows iso source, anyways

2017-09-05T15:23:28 <stegru> no, build tools wont be in the windows iso

2017-09-05T15:24:12 <javjarfer> stegru, by the way, I checked your previous suggestions about the SR, and I looked it right the first time
2017-09-05T15:24:18 <stegru> oh yes ok
2017-09-05T15:24:40 <stegru> what\'s that, javjarfer ?
2017-09-05T15:25:15 <javjarfer> the classic-shell stuff on the SR, uninstalling and no key on registeredapplications
2017-09-05T15:25:26 <stegru> ahh ok
2017-09-05T15:29:28 <gloob> is this one https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise
2017-09-05T15:30:50 <gloob> maybe is something we are adding
2017-09-05T15:31:01 <gloob> I will tell to Alfredo
2017-09-05T15:31:03 <stegru> i think so
2017-09-05T15:31:48 <stegru> maybe we can just delete random files from the image until it breaks ;)

2017-09-05T15:35:42 <amatas_> https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/blob/master/scripts/chocolatey-packages.bat
2017-09-05T15:36:09 <amatas_> those are the packages that are installed on the images which name ends with -Apps
2017-09-05T15:41:06 <stegru> it\'s interesting that I had no 2017 related things on a vm I provisioned earlier.. even though that script hadn\'t changed
2017-09-05T15:41:15 <stegru> well, it\'s not interesting really
2017-09-05T15:41:20 * clown_mtg has quit
2017-09-05T15:42:10 <stegru> perhaps it installed the latest version at the time of provisioning.. which could break something one day

2017-09-05T15:58:18 <stegru> both SDKs and both build tools seem to be installed.. perhaps 2015 was installed because it\'s a dependency of something

2017-09-05T16:18:34 <stegru> oh well
2017-09-05T16:22:25 <stegru> did you add the System.Runtime reference?
2017-09-05T16:22:33 <stegru> <Reference Include="System.Runtime" />
2017-09-05T16:22:49 <stegru> around line 61 of the sln file
2017-09-05T16:23:35 <gloob> cssproj only, I just applied your patch
2017-09-05T16:24:20 <stegru> yes, csproj sorry.. that\'s what i meant to say
2017-09-05T16:24:20 <gloob> +    <Reference Include="System.Runtime" />
2017-09-05T16:24:29 <stegru> without the \'+\' ?
2017-09-05T16:24:36 <gloob> well, you know
2017-09-05T16:24:43 <stegru> just making sure!
2017-09-05T16:24:50 <gloob> stegru: that\'s the git diff output
2017-09-05T16:25:04 <gloob> stegru: sure that you are not smiling, eh
2017-09-05T16:25:10 <stegru> haha
2017-09-05T16:25:33 <stegru> what happens when you build it manually?
2017-09-05T16:25:45 <stegru> i mean.. run msbuild on the command line
2017-09-05T16:25:54 <gloob> let\'s see
2017-09-05T16:26:06 <stegru> eg: S:\\gpii\\windows\\listeners\\GPII_ProximityListener>msbuild /t:rebuild GPIIWindowsProximityListener.sln
2017-09-05T16:26:33 <stegru> oh you\'ll need to get into the "2015 MSBuild Command Prompt"
2017-09-05T16:27:05 <gloob> ps1 doesn\'t make the trick?
2017-09-05T16:27:42 <stegru> well, you need the build tools on the $PATH
2017-09-05T16:28:10 <gloob> it succeeded
2017-09-05T16:28:24 <gloob> so, we need the same path things like the prompt
2017-09-05T16:29:14 <stegru> build.ps1 does that already
2017-09-05T16:29:33 <stegru> otherwise you\'d get "command not found" for msbuild
2017-09-05T16:31:40 <gloob> amazing, if I run the same from the powershell the postbuild is failing, a copy back of the exe
2017-09-05T16:31:43 <gloob> to undefined
2017-09-05T16:36:29 <gloob> stegru: https://ibb.co/iVuyZF
2017-09-05T16:36:53 <stegru> well, i pasted the lines from your build.ps1 into the console and it worked
2017-09-05T16:39:49 <stegru> are you building the csproj? if so, build the sln
2017-09-05T16:40:01 <stegru> msbuild skjdfsdf.SLN
2017-09-05T16:40:13 <gloob> aha, yes

2017-09-05T16:40:57 <stegru> i don\'t like the way tab completion is on windows
2017-09-05T16:41:57 <gloob> is it the same in ps1 than in cmd or others?
2017-09-05T16:42:05 <gloob> because I always feel it different
2017-09-05T16:42:36 <gloob> I always feel like a foreigner in any windows terminal
2017-09-05T16:43:06 <stegru> it goes through each one, instead of completing up to the different character like bash does
2017-09-05T16:43:37 <stegru> i\'m always deleting the wrong files because of it
2017-09-05T16:45:16 <stegru> so how come you got that CS## error? what did you do differently?
2017-09-05T16:46:07 <gloob> if I run ./Build.ps1
2017-09-05T16:46:16 <gloob> I think the recipe for build need tweaking
2017-09-05T16:46:19 <gloob> I\'m going to change it
2017-09-05T16:46:23 <stegru> ok
2017-09-05T16:46:29 <stegru> oh my tea is ready
2017-09-05T16:46:30 <gloob> and do it in the way you told me

2017-09-05T13:03:22 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - ok - so what you did was to patch the hst2017 branch so that it incorporates the GPII-2383 branch of universal?

2017-09-05T13:09:26 <kasparn__> or just "audio" ... that only has linux settings
2017-09-05T13:09:31 <Bosmon> And use the leakage of the proximityTriggered endpoint to trigger a login

2017-09-05T13:09:50 <kasparn__> sneaky sneaky
2017-09-05T13:10:21 <Bosmon> Great
2017-09-05T13:10:23 <Bosmon> "audio" worked
2017-09-05T13:10:46 <Bosmon> I don\'t even want the osk since this will screw up my window layout forever .....
2017-09-05T13:11:02 <Bosmon> We really need to make the system easier to test

2017-09-05T13:22:13 * amatas joined the channel
2017-09-05T13:29:04 <jhernandez_> Bosmon:  sorry, I was out
2017-09-05T13:29:18 <jhernandez_> you don\'t need the hst branch of nothing
2017-09-05T13:29:32 <jhernandez_> just check my branch out
2017-09-05T13:29:41 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - yes, I\'ve got as far as being able to test the branch out now
2017-09-05T13:29:45 <Bosmon> The instructions need a lot of work : P
2017-09-05T13:29:57 <jhernandez_> and run the gpii in development mode
2017-09-05T13:30:04 <jhernandez_> this is node gpii.js
2017-09-05T13:30:10 <jhernandez_> then you can use the client example
2017-09-05T13:30:23 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-09-05T13:30:45 <jhernandez_> and yes, all of it needs love
2017-09-05T13:31:27 <Bosmon> It seems like the model idiom of the lifecyclemanager is a bit deficient
2017-09-05T13:31:30 <jhernandez_> I\'m wondering how far did you go with kasparn__ on the session\'s model
2017-09-05T13:31:36 <jhernandez_> okay
2017-09-05T13:31:45 <jhernandez_> that\'s what i was waiting for
2017-09-05T13:31:51 <Bosmon> Well, nothing on that yet
2017-09-05T13:32:04 <jhernandez_> yeah, I guess we need kasparn__\'s magic here
2017-09-05T13:32:25 <Bosmon> His work so far has been on backing out some his July pull which removed some of the info that we needed on the client side
2017-09-05T13:32:32 <kasparn__> dudes
2017-09-05T13:32:49 <Bosmon> Well ok the idiom is not so bad
2017-09-05T13:32:56 <Bosmon> It\'s just the PCP channel is listening to the wrong events
2017-09-05T13:35:25 <Bosmon> Ah interesting, this is all in "LifecycleManagerSession" .....
2017-09-05T13:35:30 <jhernandez_> yes
2017-09-05T13:35:34 <jhernandez_> that\'s THE THING
2017-09-05T13:35:35 <Bosmon> It is all starting to come back to me now, as though from a former life .....
2017-09-05T13:35:41 <jhernandez_> hahaha
2017-09-05T13:38:02 <Bosmon> Well, the more we work on this, the more and more silly it seems to support more than a single session
2017-09-05T13:38:16 <Bosmon> What a lot of unnecessary mess this creates

2017-09-05T14:32:31 <jhernandez_> stegru: I need your help
2017-09-05T14:32:45 <stegru> what\'s the matter?
2017-09-05T14:32:47 <jhernandez_> well, Ale too
2017-09-05T14:33:10 <stegru> pale ale?
2017-09-05T14:33:20 <jhernandez_> he took your vaio listener and put it on a windows branch with the rest of the listeners
2017-09-05T14:33:46 <jhernandez_> this way we can compile it when provisioning/building
2017-09-05T14:33:52 <stegru> yeh
2017-09-05T14:34:32 <jhernandez_> the problem is that we aren\'t able to actually compile it with what we already have in the vagrant box
2017-09-05T14:34:39 <gloob> well, we can
2017-09-05T14:35:00 <stegru> sorry, but what does this have to do with me? ;)
2017-09-05T14:35:02 <gloob> but not how we want it :D
2017-09-05T14:35:05 <gloob> hahahaha
2017-09-05T14:35:09 <jhernandez_> well, we can, but we need to install an insane amount of things
2017-09-05T14:35:15 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-05T14:35:21 <jhernandez_> and we don\'t want that
2017-09-05T14:35:28 <gloob> stegru: help
2017-09-05T14:35:51 <gloob> stegru: some hints maybe
2017-09-05T14:36:25 <stegru> what branch is it in?
2017-09-05T14:36:48 <jhernandez_> https://github.com/gloob/windows/tree/GPII-2537
2017-09-05T14:36:56 <gloob> https://github.com/gloob/windows/blob/GPII-2537/provisioning/Build.ps1#L46
2017-09-05T14:37:02 <stegru> ok
2017-09-05T14:37:26 <gloob> what we want, ideally, is to have a chocolatey recipe to install the needed .net sdk
2017-09-05T14:37:41 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-05T14:37:47 <gloob> the only way to compile we find is to install the .net part of vs2017
2017-09-05T14:38:00 <gloob> it seems that in the vagrant machine are living vs2015 and vs2017
2017-09-05T14:38:08 <stegru> ah right ok
2017-09-05T14:38:35 <stegru> yes, I bet because it\'s using some newer feature of .NET... the proximity thing
2017-09-05T14:38:37 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-05T14:38:42 <jhernandez_> right
2017-09-05T14:38:43 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-05T14:39:04 <stegru> i already had troubles building it with visual studio
2017-09-05T14:39:12 <stegru> on a non-vagrant vm
2017-09-05T14:39:46 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2017-09-05T14:41:02 <stegru> yes, the error confirms this
2017-09-05T14:41:07 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-09-05T14:42:28 <jhernandez_> so, I ended up installing Microsoft.Net.Component.4.5.TargetingPack via vs installer gui and I got it working
2017-09-05T14:42:45 <stegru> yes, i was about to suggest something like that
2017-09-05T14:42:58 <jhernandez_> BUT, I can\'t perform such silent installation
2017-09-05T14:43:07 <stegru> do you really think it\'s worth building it, though?
2017-09-05T14:43:36 <jhernandez_> I added a vs_installershell.exe modify --add Microsoft.Net.Component.4.5.TargetingPack and it says that the component can\'t be found
2017-09-05T14:45:00 <jhernandez_> well, IMHO it\'s worth building it like we do with the other listeners
2017-09-05T14:46:08 <gloob> well, it\'s not critical but would be good
2017-09-05T14:46:15 <jhernandez_> yeah
2017-09-05T14:46:35 <jhernandez_> we can always include the binary from within the installer
2017-09-05T14:48:01 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-05T14:48:17 <stegru> it\'s ok, i\'ve fixed it
2017-09-05T14:48:32 <stegru> oh wait, no i haven\'t
2017-09-05T14:48:46 <stegru> ok i\'ve made it give a different error :)
2017-09-05T14:49:23 <gloob> hahaha, I did the same xD
2017-09-05T14:49:25 <stegru> the reference assemblies for .net 4.5.1 is installed.. so i changed the thing to use that
2017-09-05T14:49:44 <gloob> it\'s a trap

2017-09-05T09:22:21 <javjarfer> hi stegru, good morning, do you know about this issue? I discovered it yesterday https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2573
2017-09-05T09:22:58 <stegru> ah yes i do, javjarfer
2017-09-05T09:23:18 <stegru> in fact, there\'s some code that\'s under review, might be merged today
2017-09-05T09:23:30 <javjarfer> really? solving that issue?
2017-09-05T09:24:09 <stegru> yep
2017-09-05T09:24:29 <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/126/commits/dded1806a8537093f7f4ae65b2ffa31a7926da23
2017-09-05T09:26:17 <javjarfer> stegru, that is magic, is there an issue related with that, so I can link mine?
2017-09-05T09:26:23 * amatas has quit
2017-09-05T09:26:30 <stegru> it\'s for GPII-2333
2017-09-05T09:26:50 <stegru> it was to get the MachineGUID, which is only available in the 64bit registry
2017-09-05T09:27:15 <javjarfer> okay, no \'sub-task\', nice I will link with the big and comment the dependency
2017-09-05T09:28:00 <stegru> i\'m curious, why do you need this?
2017-09-05T09:29:01 <javjarfer> because there is no key for ClassicShell inside the redirected folder for 32 bit processes
2017-09-05T09:29:20 <javjarfer> they are stored only in the 64bit version of SOFTWARE
2017-09-05T09:29:25 <stegru> ah ok
2017-09-05T09:32:14 <stegru> so the key will be in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE? if so, you might not be able to modify it
2017-09-05T09:36:18 <javjarfer> stegru, yes, but I only want to read them, by the way, you fast comment has made mine pointless xD
2017-09-05T09:36:36 <stegru> which?
2017-09-05T09:36:41 <stegru> oh
2017-09-05T09:37:05 <stegru> oh we both deleted!
2017-09-05T09:37:07 <javjarfer> nooooo
2017-09-05T09:37:10 <javjarfer> xD
2017-09-05T09:37:10 <stegru> haha
2017-09-05T09:37:20 <stegru> ok, you do it
2017-09-05T09:37:35 <javjarfer> haha okay, as you like
2017-09-05T09:37:56 <stegru> i thought it was opened by the other javi
2017-09-05T09:38:59 <javjarfer> oh, this ones are mine, I should be called JJ there, I\'m going to change that, could lead to confusion
2017-09-05T09:40:22 <javjarfer> better now?
2017-09-05T09:41:06 <stegru> yes
2017-09-05T09:41:25 <stegru> when you use this code, you might want to remove this comment: https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/463fcb4d0b32fa1cce79454d8f1680da1d9e334a/gpii/node_modules/registrySettingsHandler/src/RegistrySettingsHandler.js#L142

2017-09-05T11:16:52 <Bosmon> stegru - ok, so the tests are stalling randomly ...
2017-09-05T11:16:55 <Bosmon> I wonder with what rate
2017-09-05T11:17:02 <Bosmon> So you just retested them and they passed
2017-09-05T11:17:12 <Bosmon> Why do we get this message btw: "Unable to get installation ID" ?
2017-09-05T11:17:38 <stegru> yes that last one was due to GPII-2001 - SPI\'s non-client metrics
2017-09-05T11:18:14 <Bosmon> javjarfer - how did you run into a requirement for the registry bitness issue?
2017-09-05T11:20:22 <stegru> the failure to get the installation ID is due to the tests not running  with gpii.contexts.windows
2017-09-05T11:21:10 <stegru> getting the ID is platform specific
2017-09-05T11:22:28 <javjarfer> Bosmon, creating a proper IsInstalled block for verifying classicshell installation in the SR, values only exist into the 64bit SOFTWARE registry path, not in the 32 mapped space
2017-09-05T11:30:11 <stegru> javjarfer: , is there something in HKLM/Software/RegisteredApplications about classic shell?
2017-09-05T11:30:30 <stegru> that key is shared... https://msdn.microsoft.com/aa384253
2017-09-05T11:30:42 <javjarfer> is directly in SOFTWARE/IvoSoft/ClassicShell
2017-09-05T11:31:13 <stegru> yes, but it might also add something in that one
2017-09-05T11:32:30 * yuriy joined the channel
2017-09-05T11:32:47 <stegru> another question, that you don\'t want to hear... what if you uninstall classic shell, do the keys still remain?
2017-09-05T11:34:33 <javjarfer> no, they are erased as far as I remember, I also checked the rest of the registry looking for keys, but I\'m going to re-check both things, just in case

However, we wanted to ask about the current state of the PCP API, especially since we are now making progress on the visual tasks and are hoping to start hooking up the visuals to the API soon.
2017-09-05T11:55:25 <Bosmon> yuriy - yes, I am working on it right now - I hope to have some results by the end of the day

2017-09-05T12:12:14 <yuriy> thank you
2017-09-05T12:18:13 <Bosmon> kasparn__ - did someone change the gpii-committers list password from what it was when you last told me what it was? : P

2017-09-05T12:46:30 <kasparn__> Bosmon: not me, no
2017-09-05T12:46:39 <kasparn__> I didn\'t know I knew it
2017-09-05T12:46:42 <kasparn__> :)
2017-09-05T12:46:46 <Bosmon> gtirloni - do you know about the list passwords?
2017-09-05T12:46:57 <Bosmon> kasparn__ - I have in my Skype buffer that you told me the password some time last year
2017-09-05T12:47:02 <Bosmon> But it is always possible you told me wrong : P
2017-09-05T12:47:11 <kasparn__> likely even
2017-09-05T12:47:12 <gtirloni> Bosmon: I can change them if you want
2017-09-05T12:48:08 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - I\'m trying to follow your instructions to the Astea team on how to test the PCP channnel
2017-09-05T12:48:10 <Bosmon> And not getting very far : P
2017-09-05T12:49:49 <Bosmon> kasparn__ - so I am looking at this def for the CloudBasedFlowManager: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L37
2017-09-05T12:49:56 <Bosmon> I had thought we had fixed this terrible factoring....
2017-09-05T12:50:01 <Bosmon> But it must just have been "in my mind"
2017-09-05T12:50:06 <Bosmon> We *do* now have a proper flowManager.local grade
2017-09-05T12:50:14 <Bosmon> So we shouldn\'t need to do this rubbish
2017-09-05T12:50:33 <Bosmon> As a result of this we have now "leaked" an endpoint, since we forgot to override proximityTriggered here along with all the other local endpoints
2017-09-05T12:51:45 <Bosmon> georgitodorov, yuriy - I\'m just trying to work through the instructions for testing the PCP channel at the moment
2017-09-05T12:51:52 <Bosmon> COuld you outline for me how you have been testing it so far?
2017-09-05T12:52:09 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-05T12:52:38 <kasparn__> Bosmon: ugh - yeah, there are some issues with the current flow
2017-09-05T12:52:46 <kasparn__> grades*
2017-09-05T12:52:55 <kasparn__> I also find the naming a bit confusing sometimes
2017-09-05T12:53:49 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-09-05T12:53:53 <Bosmon> I see that gpii.flowManager.config.development already derives from gpii.flowManager.config.local.base.json
2017-09-05T12:53:58 <Bosmon> So we are screwed right at the beginning
2017-09-05T12:54:35 <georgitodorov> Bosmon - We have been using an example from the GPII-2383 branch. Here is the link: https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/blob/GPII-2383/examples/pcpChannelClient/pcpChannelClient.js
2017-09-05T12:54:35 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2017-09-05T12:54:37 <Bosmon> as does gpii.flowManager.config.production
2017-09-05T12:55:01 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes - how are you currently starting up the main architecture, and what requests do you use to test it?
2017-09-05T12:56:27 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2017-09-05T12:57:10 <georgitodorov> Bosmon - so far we have only worked with the message which is sent to the PCP when the user keys in successfully
2017-09-05T12:58:13 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - and how have you triggered this message?
2017-09-05T12:58:29 * sepidehshahi has quit
2017-09-05T12:58:34 <georgitodorov> It is sent automatically when the user keys in
2017-09-05T12:59:36 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - how do you key the user in?
2017-09-05T12:59:57 <Bosmon> Sorry to ask these dumb questions but I want to be absolutely clear about everything :)
2017-09-05T13:00:58 <georgitodorov> Bosmon - we are making a request to http://localhost:8081/user/<token>/login
2017-09-05T13:01:11 <georgitodorov> We are not using the socket for this purpose
