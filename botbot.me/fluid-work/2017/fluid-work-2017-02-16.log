2017-02-16T20:19:31 <simonjb> Bosmon: thanks for your updates to KETTLE-57 -- I had a question: in the test, is the sequence "{packageRequest}.send", "{packageRequest2}.send" guaranteed to cause both requests to be active at the same time? or could the first finish before the second is processed?
2017-02-16T20:21:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - it is guaranteed for them to be both active at the same time given the particular implementation of the "serveStatic" middleware
2017-02-16T20:21:29 <Bosmon> Which guarantees, by my reading, to do some async I/O in order to resolve the content to be served

2017-02-16T20:21:55 * _-___-_ has left the channel
2017-02-16T20:23:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, I\'m fine with that -- another approach would be to craft specific test async middleware that is able to verify that its request is no longer marked
2017-02-16T20:23:58 <Bosmon> simonjb - unfortunately this wouldn\'t work because the marking needs to be undone during the action of the middleware itself :(
2017-02-16T20:24:06 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit of an awkward compromise, really
2017-02-16T20:24:18 <Bosmon> As I try to explain on the JIRA, hopefully ....
2017-02-16T20:25:03 <Bosmon> If the middleware is async, we have to assume that all bets are off in terms of knowing exactly when its code is active
2017-02-16T20:25:15 <Bosmon> And so we lose any of the benefits that request marking might give us
2017-02-16T20:25:42 <Bosmon> But at least we can avoid not stuffing up our marking for the rest of the time when we hope we might gain a bit of value from it
2017-02-16T20:26:35 <simonjb> Bosmon: I was meaning to implement a test grade using kettle.plainAsyncMiddleware that need not be async in implementation but verifies that when it is called, the request has been unmarked
2017-02-16T20:27:16 <simonjb> does that make sense?

2017-02-16T14:30:17 <the-t-in-rtf> well, apparently not, as my next question is about "reverse"
2017-02-16T14:30:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume it\'s to handle neutron flows
2017-02-16T14:30:42 <the-t-in-rtf> it does not appear in the documentation, looking at the comments now.
2017-02-16T14:32:04 <the-t-in-rtf> IMO we should take advantage of the new pseudoevent-only core to make the reverse bit part of the listener definition.
2017-02-16T14:32:15 <the-t-in-rtf> and avoid having to carry it around as part of the options.
2017-02-16T14:33:17 <the-t-in-rtf> or at least we should make the reverse bit something that only is added by the CouchDB grade
2017-02-16T14:33:37 <the-t-in-rtf> unless we intended for that to be of general use somehow.
2017-02-16T14:35:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Actually, I\'m trying to find anything that uses "reverse".
2017-02-16T14:35:55 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I think that may be a bit of cruft left over from the pre-transform days.
2017-02-16T14:36:23 <the-t-in-rtf> In fact I can\'t find anywhere in the whole kettle project that it\'s actually used.
2017-02-16T14:51:28 * clown joined the channel
2017-02-16T14:51:35 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - try removing it and see what happens :)
2017-02-16T14:52:40 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I was just looking through options for url parsing.  I think most of the difference between jQuery.ajax and http.request is down to that.
2017-02-16T14:53:00 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - right - do we have a reasonable candidate for url parsing on the client side?
2017-02-16T14:53:10 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s not needed on the client side
2017-02-16T14:53:12 <Bosmon> In the ancient days we used to use this silly giant regex
2017-02-16T14:53:16 <the-t-in-rtf> jQuery work directly with a url.
2017-02-16T14:53:19 <the-t-in-rtf> s
2017-02-16T14:53:42 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - it doesn, but the structure of the dataSource URL API allows that URL elements which can be parsed out into terms can be overridden on a term-by-term basis
2017-02-16T14:54:00 <Bosmon> Unless we mean to break that contract between the client and the server, we should try to retain a parser
2017-02-16T14:54:11 <the-t-in-rtf> So, the closest candidate is this: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api
2017-02-16T14:54:14 <Bosmon> As for "reverse" - this is a crucial piece of the dataSource implementation
2017-02-16T14:54:21 <the-t-in-rtf> which is supported by everything except 11
2017-02-16T14:54:32 <the-t-in-rtf> IE 11
2017-02-16T14:54:40 <Bosmon> Because the natural operation of data transforms is to run in the reverse order with respect to writing as when reading
2017-02-16T14:55:10 <Bosmon> The crucial importance of "reverse" is that the listeners to the pseudoevent are notified in reverse order when implementing "set" as "get"
2017-02-16T14:55:22 <Bosmon> For example, JSON parsing happens first on "get" and last on "set"
2017-02-16T14:55:36 <the-t-in-rtf> IMO that should be handled with priorities from now on.
2017-02-16T14:55:58 <the-t-in-rtf> in the listener defs.
2017-02-16T14:57:33 <Bosmon> I guess you could say that it is confusing that both of these priorities are listed as "after": https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-core.js#L303
2017-02-16T14:57:39 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-core.js#L314
2017-02-16T14:59:22 <the-t-in-rtf> so is there anything that would prevent us from smoothing this out as part of this work, i.e. making the priorities work in the order they appear in the declarative options?
2017-02-16T14:59:35 <Bosmon> I don\'t think so
2017-02-16T14:59:41 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s a reasonable time to break compatibility
2017-02-16T15:00:30 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit of a shame, since the original model for this imagined that these elements would be even more declarative than this
2017-02-16T15:00:38 <Bosmon> Casting this as an actual chain of transforms, that is, model transforms
2017-02-16T15:01:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Once it\'s pseudo-events all the way down, you can wire as many of those into the chain as you like.
2017-02-16T15:01:17 <Bosmon> And hence that the inverse chain would be constructed by the framework automatically by means of the "inverseConfiguration" workflow
2017-02-16T15:01:28 <Bosmon> But I guess there\'s no reason that can\'t happen in the future
2017-02-16T15:01:50 <gloob> is this similar to say, that it needs to be "stackable"? sorry for the interruption just trying to understand the reversing need

2017-02-16T17:43:30 <alanharnum> hi aashay - probably the best place to look for information on decapod (which isn\'t under active development any longer, I believe) is the Wiki page at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Decapod
2017-02-16T17:45:25 <alanharnum> it looks like the source code is hosted on the (now-archived) Google Code page at https://code.google.com/archive/p/decapod/
2017-02-16T17:47:29 <aashay> okay. i didn\'t know it is not under active development. i saw issues on JIRA so i thought i may can solve some of them.
