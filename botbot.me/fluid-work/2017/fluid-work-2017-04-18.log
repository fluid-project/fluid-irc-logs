b'2017-04-18T18:07:32 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf is another person well-versed in this kind of thing, through having his own parallel infrastructure for it for testing his gpii-express apps
2017-04-18T18:07:56 <Bosmon> Because we didn\'t have FLUID-5903, everyone has ended up doing this kind of thing just an ever-so-slightly different way
2017-04-18T18:08:39 <Bosmon> But sadly due to "attention investment" it has so far made sense for everyone to just carry on with whatever they had already
2017-04-18T18:08:52 <Bosmon> This is the cluttered landscape that you now join :)

2017-04-18T18:10:22 <michelled> at least I\'m not alone in it :)
2017-04-18T18:10:41 <Bosmon> No, on the contrary, it\'s disturbingly densely inhabited : P
2017-04-18T18:11:19 <michelled> it will take me a while to parse through all this - thank you for the tour and pointers
2017-04-18T18:11:30 <michelled> I expect I\'ll be pinging you before long with more questions
2017-04-18T18:11:30 <Bosmon> Yup, it will definitely take a while!
2017-04-18T18:11:44 <Bosmon> Yes, and do ask questions early rather than get frustrated if things aren\'t making sense
2017-04-18T18:11:54 <Bosmon> Since in general there will be lots of things that don\'t seem to make clear sense : P
2017-04-18T18:12:03 <michelled> :)
2017-04-18T18:12:05 <Bosmon> There is *some* documentation in this area, but there\'s really nothing "end to end"
2017-04-18T18:12:22 <Bosmon> Since there has never been a kind of central "end to end" strategy of solving this kind of problem
2017-04-18T18:13:34 <Bosmon> These ones were sort of the straws which broke the camel\'s back: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/ContextIntegrationTests.js and https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/JournalIntegrationTests.js
2017-04-18T18:13:41 <Bosmon> Written respectively by kasparnet and me
2017-04-18T18:13:51 <Bosmon> WHich show such a painful failure to achieve reuse that one can only weep : P
2017-04-18T18:14:01 <Bosmon> But in seeing these I just had to take some time out last year and fix FLUID-5903
2017-04-18T18:14:35 <kasparnet> hehe
2017-04-18T18:14:51 <Bosmon> But these two represent our current "central practice" in this area
2017-04-18T18:15:03 <kasparnet> your description on the state of the tests/framework is so gloomy
2017-04-18T18:15:05 <Bosmon> So if your tests end up looking something like these, you haven\'t gone very much more badly wrong than the rest of us : P
2017-04-18T18:15:24 <michelled> haha
2017-04-18T18:15:54 <Bosmon> They will consist of i) some recognisable grades, ii) some recognisable global functions, and iii) some random wreckage of semi-recognisable JSON blobs encoding sequence entries, bit of component tree sent in for random mangling into some kinds of "grade-building macros"
2017-04-18T18:16:49 <Bosmon> THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE WRITTEN WHEN WE WERE CALLED UPON TO WRITE TESTS

2017-04-18T17:41:53 <michelled> Bosmon: you were about to walk me through some examples of integration tests in the GPII
2017-04-18T17:42:00 <Bosmon> michelled, yes, exactly
2017-04-18T17:42:15 <Bosmon> And then I convinced myself through a faulty visual scan of the channel list that you weren\'t actually here : P
2017-04-18T17:42:19 <Bosmon> But I see that you actually are :)
2017-04-18T17:42:38 <michelled> sneakily hiding in plain sight
2017-04-18T17:43:07 <Bosmon> The only other person I see here right now who might have some further input is cindyli, so I am hereby pinging her too : P
2017-04-18T17:43:33 <Bosmon> So, at present it\'s hard to point someone to a good "one stop shop" for how to write Integration/Acceptance tests for the GPII, for a number of reasons
2017-04-18T17:43:57 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-04-18T17:43:59 <Bosmon> To start with, here is the directory where some of the drivers for what could be called "eccentric tests" can be found: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/tests
2017-04-18T17:44:36 <Bosmon> But we also have what could be called "generic Acceptance/Integration tests" which are hiding in directories like these: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/tests/platform/windows
2017-04-18T17:45:12 <Bosmon> The "generic tests" all test the same overall workflow - they fire up the GPII, try to log on as a particular user, verify that particular settings are set and that the system stays running, log off, and then verify that the system is restored
2017-04-18T17:45:20 <Bosmon> And so as a result they are expressed mostly declaratively
2017-04-18T17:45:48 <Bosmon> Here are the 3 tests for Windows builtIn AT settings, for example: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js
2017-04-18T17:46:33 <Bosmon> The "eccentric tests", on the other hand, take the GPII through some particular elaborated workflow - for example, restoring a journal session after a crash, or verifying that the system adapts after a context change, etc.
2017-04-18T17:46:48 <Bosmon> So - here is the basic ground situation
2017-04-18T17:47:11 <Bosmon> i) Each of these tests, at bottom, evaluates to a sequence of fixtures which are operated with the IoC Testing Framework
2017-04-18T17:47:30 <Bosmon> Which is described here: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html
2017-04-18T17:48:00 <Bosmon> ii) However, the workflow by which the fixture are actually encoded and built up can be a little indirect, since you need to work your way through a stack of sometimes 2 or 3 layers
2017-04-18T17:48:35 <Bosmon> a) At the bottom there is the IoC Testing Framework itself - b) next up is Kettle\'s inbuilt libraries for setting up and tearing down IoC testing framework fixtures against Kettle servers, which are described here:
2017-04-18T17:48:56 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/KettleTestingFramework.md
2017-04-18T17:49:25 <Bosmon> Then finally there is sometimes c) which is the GPII\'s inbuilt libraries for expressing integration tests against a Kettle server which, particularly, is a GPII FlowManager, which are operated here:
2017-04-18T17:50:18 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Testing.js#L239
2017-04-18T17:50:39 <Bosmon> This is a useful point to look at, because it shows the layers being built up directly via grade inheritance on "testCaseHolders"
2017-04-18T17:51:05 <Bosmon> "fluid.test.testCaseHolder" is the grade at level a), the built-in definition for the IoC testing framework itself
2017-04-18T17:51:27 <Bosmon> "kettle.test.testCaseHolder" is the grade at level b), the one elaborated to target a Kettle server
2017-04-18T17:51:44 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-04-18T17:51:56 <Bosmon> And then "gpii.test.common.testCaseHolder" is one at level c) which operates generic workflow for the GPII Acceptance/Integration tests
2017-04-18T17:52:47 <Bosmon> Hey there kasparnet - great you\'ve arrived... we were just talking over the best way to help someone write integration-type tests against the GPII :)
2017-04-18T17:54:29 <kasparnet> ah
2017-04-18T17:56:05 <Bosmon> Now, one big reason that all of this stuff is particularly hard to reuse and understand, is that every one of these tests was written before an IoC testing framework feature which was written recognising how hard all of these tests were to reuse and understand :)
2017-04-18T17:56:16 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5903 which led to http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html#using-sequencegrade-to-build-up-complex-reusable-test-sequences
2017-04-18T17:56:25 <Bosmon> Which, sadly, noone has ever yet had time to ever try to use
2017-04-18T17:56:33 <Bosmon> But perhaps someone might someday :)
2017-04-18T17:56:48 <michelled> do you mean me today?
2017-04-18T17:56:55 <Bosmon> Well, not specifically, I think
2017-04-18T17:57:05 <Bosmon> It would only add to your burdens to write your tests using a feature noone has ever used
2017-04-18T17:57:15 <Bosmon> But I am just mentioning it as a general roadmap thing : P
2017-04-18T17:57:22 <michelled> :)
2017-04-18T17:57:54 <Bosmon> So, the very very simplest end-to-end tests of any kind that we have in the GPII are these ones:
2017-04-18T17:58:14 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/DevelopmentTests.js
2017-04-18T17:58:38 <Bosmon> For which all the real business stuff is held in here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/shared/DevelopmentTestDefs.js
2017-04-18T17:59:01 <Bosmon> These are always the kind of "smoke test" tests that I run first after doing something disruptive to verify that the GPII can even start at all
2017-04-18T17:59:14 <Bosmon> And so I suggest that you adopt something like this as a kind of skeleton/model
2017-04-18T17:59:43 <Bosmon> You can even include this actual file itself and just override the one thing you need - which is the configName here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/shared/DevelopmentTestDefs.js#L46
2017-04-18T18:00:11 <Bosmon> The most basic level of your mission, to start with, is firing up your app "config" in any kind of test harness at all
2017-04-18T18:00:20 <Bosmon> And this itself might take a while to get right : P
2017-04-18T18:00:33 <Bosmon> But once you\'ve got there, we\'ve got a basis for working on to start expressing actual test fixtures against i
2017-04-18T18:00:35 <Bosmon> it
2017-04-18T18:00:46 <michelled> great - this is a good starting point
2017-04-18T18:01:16 <Bosmon> But as you can see, because of this horrific pre-FLUID-5903 nonsense, this "blob of JSON" here at line 42 isn\'t even any kind of grade
2017-04-18T18:01:30 <Bosmon> It\'s just a random blob of JSON which will *become* a grade when sent into a machine
2017-04-18T18:02:11 <Bosmon> In this case the thing that eats it is "kettle.test.bootstrapServer", on this line: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/DevelopmentTests.js#L28
2017-04-18T18:02:32 <Bosmon> This is described a little bit here in the docs at https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/KettleTestingFramework.md
2017-04-18T18:02:45 <Bosmon> But unfortunately it is one of those things that you\'re just going to have to refer to the source code of a lot
2017-04-18T18:03:28 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L274
2017-04-18T18:04:07 <Bosmon> The meat of it is this transformer here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L249
2017-04-18T18:04:22 <Bosmon> Which eats the config and sticks it inside a "kettle.test.serverEnvironment"
2017-04-18T18:04:54 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry to say this stuff confuses even me, and it would be best to draw out all the stuff that gets made onto a piece of paper, so you can be a bit more clear about it : P
2017-04-18T18:05:06 <Bosmon> But this, morally, is what is going on
2017-04-18T18:05:21 <Bosmon> You don\'t need to specifically use this bootstrap function, and most of the tests actually don\'t
2017-04-18T18:06:48 <Bosmon> But they all achieve the same effect, of taking all the configuration to build a Kettle server, and spitting out the modified configuration to instantiate that same-configured server inside a bigger component tree that includes a "fluid.test.testEnvironment" at the top, the server somewhere in it, and then a "fluid.test.testCaseHolder" holding your test fixtures
2017-04-18T18:07:06 <Bosmon> And then adds a bit of synchronisation to make sure that your test fixtures don\'t start evaluating until the server has started up
