2017-12-05T16:21:49 <simonjb> I just filed a JIRA issue for the Nexus packaging work
2017-12-05T16:21:52 <amatas_> Just in the case any of you need to do some testing on this new version
2017-12-05T16:23:17 <amatas_> I've to say that I've passed the unittest and the acceptances tests of GPII-Windows and they seem to pass
2017-12-05T16:29:12 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I guess we've got tomorrow morning to finish building the updated installer anyway
2017-12-05T16:32:40 <gtirloni> simonjb: thank you
2017-12-05T16:33:09 <simonjb> gtirloni: please update with any notes/details as appropriate :)
2017-12-05T16:34:02 <simonjb> gtirloni: I created a new repo yesterday https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-dist
2017-12-05T16:34:13 <gtirloni> cool, will do
2017-12-05T16:34:20 <simonjb> today I will add a runner for the Nexus with Co-Occurrence Engine

2017-12-05T16:49:47 <alanharnum> so that's good for the Boston trip

2017-12-05T18:54:56 <ussjoin_> Question for the room. I have a friend who works for a for-profit company as a backend developer. Their front-end developers are doing all sorts of weird JS stuff around showing/hiding content that will, I'm guessing, break screenreaders in a really large way. Is there a resource (like a person, or a really good guide for front-end devs) to which I could point them so that they can be educated on the error of their ways? Before they

b'2017-12-05T13:25:39 <jhernandez> any idea?
2017-12-05T13:26:44 <dandimitrov> jhernandez, yes, a small change needs to be made for the tests to work with the renamed `production` config
2017-12-05T13:26:45 <dandimitrov> I
2017-12-05T13:27:10 <dandimitrov> I\'ll push a fix right alway
2017-12-05T13:27:17 <kasparnet> jhernandez, hmm... not really... I would probably check the payload sent from the PCP first, and if that looks alright, check the input to the chrome plugin (or vice versa)
2017-12-05T13:27:18 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: okay, sweet
2017-12-05T13:27:34 <kasparnet> not sure how easy it is to break in UIO
2017-12-05T13:27:52 <kasparnet> the PCP channel is in flowmanager/PCPChannel.js
2017-12-05T13:32:20 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I can\'t see anything happening when trying to re-enable google dictionary
2017-12-05T13:32:47 <jhernandez> I guess it\'s a PCP thing, that doesn\'t trigger the change

2017-12-05T13:41:14 <kasparnet> jhernandez, ok, I\'ll just commit my hacky fix for GPII-2739 then take a look
2017-12-05T13:41:15 <kasparnet> sec
2017-12-05T13:41:53 <jhernandez> I guess that we need to think about whether this is how we want to show this special kind of setting, but that\'s it

2017-12-05T13:43:29 <jhernandez> kasparnet: nice!!
2017-12-05T13:43:35 <kasparnet> not sure where I should make the pull against, since it\'s a bit hacky
2017-12-05T13:44:09 <Bosmon> kasparnet oh wow
2017-12-05T13:44:27 <jhernandez> FYI, I\'ll take a pause in a few minutes, gotta walk the dogs and have lunch

2017-12-05T13:44:49 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-12-05T13:45:04 <Bosmon> kasparnet - would you like to add some comments to that to explain which issue the hack relates to, and when it can go away?
2017-12-05T13:45:18 <Bosmon> So what was the issue here?
2017-12-05T13:45:24 <jhernandez> stegru: the DPI not restoring to previous settings one, isn\'t it?
2017-12-05T13:45:30 <stegru> jhernandez: sorry! i didn\'t see it the first time i searched
2017-12-05T13:45:57 <kasparnet> Bosmon, some odd disagreement between different parts of the framework as to where scoped terms should live in the inferred configuration
2017-12-05T13:46:17 <jhernandez> stegru: this one https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2734
2017-12-05T13:46:19 <kasparnet> where apparently they are doubly nested in the original appliedconfiguration
2017-12-05T13:47:02 <kasparnet> Bosmon, not sure where and why the issue occured, but I suspect it might have something to do with our handling of inferred common terms
2017-12-05T13:47:11 <kasparnet> i need to do a bit more debugging to be sure
2017-12-05T13:47:40 <kasparnet> Bosmon, but yeah, I\'ll add comments to the code and re-issue the pull after checking GPII-2737 from javi
2017-12-05T13:50:30 * alanharn_ has quit
2017-12-05T13:51:18 <kasparnet> dandimitrov: it does indeed look like no message is sent from the PCP whenever the dictionary is re-enabled (i.e. an array option is re-enabled)
2017-12-05T13:52:24 <kasparnet> jhernandez, ^
2017-12-05T13:52:44 <jhernandez> yup
2017-12-05T13:53:29 <dandimitrov> kasparnet, we\'ll have a look at it
2017-12-05T13:55:13 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: cool, thanks
2017-12-05T13:55:28 <Bosmon> kasparnet, dandimitrov - don\'t forget to write up full JIRAs for each of these issues so that we can add test cases for them when we have more time
2017-12-05T13:55:54 <kasparnet> awesome, cheers dandimitrov

2017-12-05T15:02:06 <jhernandez> wrt GPII-2738, I asked JJ to do that, at least for the "popular" np sets
2017-12-05T15:02:16 <alanharnum> Bosmon kasparnet jhernandez (or anyone who knows): is there a current installer for the the version of gpii for Windows currently being used for the UX testing? particularly, one that has the integration points with Justin_o\'s UIO+ work?
2017-12-05T15:02:26 <jhernandez> these are, elaine, elmer, etc
2017-12-05T15:03:10 <kasparnet> and this is still for tomorrow, right?
2017-12-05T15:03:18 <jhernandez> kasparnet: this way we can deliver some of them by the end of today
2017-12-05T15:03:20 <kasparnet> but cool - just wanted to make sure someone was on it
2017-12-05T15:03:24 <kasparnet> that\'s great
2017-12-05T15:03:35 <jhernandez> well, since it\'s a low hanging fruit, I think that should be part of the next installer, right
2017-12-05T15:03:43 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2017-12-05T15:05:30 <jhernandez> alanharnum: right now we\'re working on the installer that introduced the PSP, not sure if you\'re interested on that one
2017-12-05T15:06:35 <jhernandez> but it\'s true that it includes the last updates to the uio+ integration
2017-12-05T15:07:35 <jhernandez> I can point you to other versions of the installer, but not sure whether they\'re missing something related to uio+
2017-12-05T15:08:51 <alanharnum> jhernandez: if those are easily at hand i\'ll take a look; I can always just run the latest from https://github.com/gpii/windows
2017-12-05T15:09:51 <jhernandez> alanharnum: you can just run the latest from the windows repo, right
2017-12-05T15:11:03 <jhernandez> here\'s a list of the installers we\'ve been delivering to QA/UX/pilots (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10gUeMrdGfALTFuiaQRYQ_zNgHhN_FMw-2vImDfVrIhw/edit#gid=0)
2017-12-05T15:12:13 <jhernandez> I\'d say that you can go with the last one from that list if you don\'t feel like setting up a windows box :)
2017-12-05T15:12:20 <jhernandez> up to you ;)
2017-12-05T15:12:38 <alanharnum> jhernandez: that\'s great, thanks :) exactly what I was hoping not to have to do (I\'m updating the Surface we use as a mobile GPII demo machine)
2017-12-05T15:13:06 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s why I\'m giving you different options

2017-12-05T15:19:15 <jhernandez> alanharnum: ^
2017-12-05T15:19:34 <jhernandez> let me know if it worked
2017-12-05T15:19:35 <alanharnum> jhernandez: yes, that - thanks!
2017-12-05T15:19:59 <alanharnum> worked perfectly
2017-12-05T15:26:09 <stegru> gloob, javjarfer[m].. I have a gift for you both: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10xqjbkTjsfkLdk11N8jfGfzRfyn_MJZjsznrBBfwEqM/edit#gid=569565979

2017-12-05T15:27:25 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: wow, what is this? a complete list of the settings from systemsettings software?
2017-12-05T15:27:55 <dandimitrov> kasparnet, I\'ve pushed a fix ( https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/27/commits/392841be720e18b47c6586954a407bc15f18feca ) for the issue ( https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2741 ) in PCP-client, and it should be working properly now :)
2017-12-05T15:28:52 <javjarfer[m]> stegru:  have you been able to trigger them through the load of the class you discovered??
2017-12-05T15:29:24 <kasparnet> awesome, thanks dandimitrov

2017-12-05T15:37:03 <javjarfer[m]> welll.... this change a lots of things, we need to create a settings handler for this... and probably talk if we need to change the current onboarded one to this new procedure or continue with them...
2017-12-05T15:38:25 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: are you available for skype call?

b'2017-12-05T10:59:25 <jhernandez> btw, I have different set ups here - different machines with different versions of windows, etc, so let me know if you want me to test things
2017-12-05T10:59:46 <kasparnet> yeah, ok, there is no metadata at all for it
2017-12-05T11:01:40 <kasparnet> dandimitrov, georgitodorov, yuriy__ : is there any functionality in the PSP for supporting a setting with a value range like: [ "dictionary", "TTS" ] where any number of these can be enabled?
2017-12-05T11:01:49 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-12-05T11:02:14 <kasparnet> (i.e. it\'s possible to hav nothing enabled, to have only the "dictionary" enabled, or both "dictionary" and "TTS" enabled
2017-12-05T11:03:44 <georgitodorov> kasparnet: Yes, we have a multipicker component for this purpose. It consists of multiple checkboxes (one per possible value)
2017-12-05T11:04:18 <georgitodorov> It is automatically used when the type of the setting is "array"
2017-12-05T11:05:11 <georgitodorov> We tried it with a setting that was previously available ("TTS tracking mode")
2017-12-05T11:05:24 <kasparnet> awesome
2017-12-05T11:05:33 <kasparnet> thanks georgitodorov
2017-12-05T11:06:06 <jhernandez> kasparnet: feel free to report the JIRAs and pass it to me if you want me to add such metadata

2017-12-05T11:22:36 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, seems like I was right.  The tests pass in a fresh VM, but a second run fails even after calling refreshenv.
2017-12-05T11:23:11 <the-t-in-rtf> What controls what\'s reset?
2017-12-05T11:23:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Seems like two of the SPI settings are getting left out.
2017-12-05T11:24:33 <stegru> i remember some issue with SPI depending on the freshness of the VM
2017-12-05T11:25:44 <stegru> refreshenv just updates the environment variables - sort of like doing a ". /etc/environment"
2017-12-05T11:27:32 * Bosmon joined the channel
2017-12-05T11:28:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I figured it out.
2017-12-05T11:29:04 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s specifically a problem if you use powershell.
2017-12-05T11:29:23 <the-t-in-rtf> If you use cmd.exe and refreshenv, the environment is reset as expected.
2017-12-05T11:29:30 <Bosmon> jhernandez - indeed, that preference path is not to be considered sospechoso :)
2017-12-05T11:29:47 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru ^^^
2017-12-05T11:30:09 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok ok, it just seemed sospechoso to me
2017-12-05T11:30:12 <stegru> ok
2017-12-05T11:30:37 <Bosmon> That\'s some really good malware, gtirloni :)
2017-12-05T11:33:03 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: the tests fail twice for me - both mentioning "MouseAcceleration" - is that what you see?
2017-12-05T11:37:27 <Bosmon> stegru, the-t-in-rtf - what\'s the suspected link between refreshenv and the SPI failures?
2017-12-05T11:37:49 <the-t-in-rtf> actually, I think it\'s coincidental.
2017-12-05T11:37:53 <Bosmon> oh wow
2017-12-05T11:38:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I actually get the failures within cmd.exe if I keep running it for long enough.
2017-12-05T11:38:17 <the-t-in-rtf> So, apparently refreshenv isn\'t enough.
2017-12-05T11:38:34 <the-t-in-rtf> you can get a single shell in a state where two of the spi settings aren\'t cleared out when you run refreshenv.
2017-12-05T11:38:47 <the-t-in-rtf> this happens in either powershell or cmd.exe
2017-12-05T11:39:02 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - what\'s the link between the SPI setting state and the state of the shell?
2017-12-05T11:39:05 <the-t-in-rtf> if you close either shell and reopen, the tests work again.
2017-12-05T11:39:16 <Bosmon> Or is this unknown
2017-12-05T11:39:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, I\'m somewhat hampered by trying to scroll back through the logs in a shell window within a VM.
2017-12-05T11:39:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Trying to get that copied out.
2017-12-05T11:40:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I will create a pastie once I manage it.
2017-12-05T11:40:20 <Bosmon> stegru - is there some conceivable coupling between shell state and SPI state?
2017-12-05T11:40:56 <stegru> until today, no
2017-12-05T11:41:06 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m not sure.
2017-12-05T11:41:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m assuming most CI runs would never hit this.
2017-12-05T11:41:27 * amatas_ joined the channel
2017-12-05T11:41:30 <the-t-in-rtf> And people in the habit of closing shell windows frequently might also easily miss it.
2017-12-05T11:41:52 <Bosmon> I certainly don\'t fall into that camp
2017-12-05T11:42:38 <stegru> I think it has something to do with the tests leaving it in a different state to the original
2017-12-05T11:42:54 <stegru> \'it\' being the system
2017-12-05T11:43:16 <Bosmon> Interesting
2017-12-05T11:43:19 <the-t-in-rtf> So, if I run my new npm test rollup the problem occurs, it may be unique to my new rollup script that calls the rest of the tests.
2017-12-05T11:43:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I am creating a pastie and will provide a link to the new rollup shortly.
2017-12-05T11:43:56 <the-t-in-rtf> just confirming if it\'s unique to running while collecting code coverage, or if it happens with the rollup script alone.
2017-12-05T11:44:11 <stegru> by the way, you can do ^A in windows terminals
2017-12-05T11:44:11 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. my pull introduces a new script that calls both the unit and acceptance tests.
2017-12-05T11:44:27 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s copying it out that\'s the problem, friend.
2017-12-05T11:44:40 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - shared clipboard?
2017-12-05T11:44:57 <the-t-in-rtf> nope.
2017-12-05T11:45:05 <Bosmon> What do you mean "nope"?
2017-12-05T11:45:14 <the-t-in-rtf> the shared clipboard doesn\'t work for me.
2017-12-05T11:45:59 <stegru> that\'s awful
2017-12-05T11:46:01 <Bosmon> That\'s a big obstruction
2017-12-05T11:46:06 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s not nice.
2017-12-05T11:46:33 <the-t-in-rtf> So, @gtirloni and @amatas, just to confirm, what version of Virtualbox should I be running?
2017-12-05T11:47:19 <stegru> do you have vboxtray running in the guest? and is it set to "Bidirectional" in the devices menu?
2017-12-05T11:47:20 <amatas_> the-t-in-rtf: the version 5.1.X should be fine, but I\'ve recently installed the 5.2.2 and seems to work with the latest vagrant
2017-12-05T11:47:43 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s whatever the default is when provisioning, I would damn well hope.
2017-12-05T11:47:49 <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise we have larger problems.
2017-12-05T11:48:32 <the-t-in-rtf> it claims the virtualbox plugin is 5.1.30
2017-12-05T11:48:52 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m running 5.1.26 on the host, so that might explain it.
2017-12-05T11:49:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll download 5.2.2, it would be a relief to be able to copy out errors again.
2017-12-05T11:50:34 <amatas_> sorry I\'m not in context, what error are you getting?
2017-12-05T11:50:46 <the-t-in-rtf> not able to copy from the client to the host.
2017-12-05T11:51:06 <the-t-in-rtf> makes it really hard to share error messages.
2017-12-05T11:51:13 <amatas_> even if the option is set at the menu bar?
2017-12-05T11:51:31 <amatas_> I mean try to double check the option
2017-12-05T11:51:37 <the-t-in-rtf> ahhhh
2017-12-05T11:51:41 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a HOST setting
2017-12-05T11:52:20 <amatas_> yes, it is a host setting at the menu bar of the VM\'s window
2017-12-05T11:52:30 <amatas_> did it solve the problem?
2017-12-05T11:54:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, thanks.  I was getting confused, there is no menu at all in the client plugin.
2017-12-05T11:54:19 <amatas_> :)
2017-12-05T11:54:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I think the refreshenv problems are unique to using istanbul and collecting code coverage.
2017-12-05T11:55:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I will investigate further, I think this may also be helped by an update to nyc similar to what I discussed with @Bosmon regarding gpii-testem.
2017-12-05T11:57:28 <amatas_> I\'m not aware of how refreshenv works, sometimes the commands are added to the PATH sometimes not
2017-12-05T11:57:57 <the-t-in-rtf> in that case the tests should not run at all, as they depend on successfully completing the pretest steps.
2017-12-05T11:58:05 <the-t-in-rtf> refreshenv is now a pretest step
2017-12-05T11:58:09 <the-t-in-rtf> part of one
2017-12-05T11:58:12 <amatas_> everytime I install a new application I do a refreshenv with the hope that the next line can exec the previos installed command
2017-12-05T11:58:45 <the-t-in-rtf> this is a bit different, I\'m not trying to pick up anything new, only to reset any environment variables set in the previous run.
2017-12-05T11:59:02 <amatas_> oh I see
2017-12-05T12:01:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Actually, I spoke too soon, it seems like the unit tests fail if I call my rollup, which requires each of the tests individually.
2017-12-05T12:01:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I can pretty easily refactor that away, let me try that.
2017-12-05T12:02:34 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-12-05T12:06:00 <the-t-in-rtf> My theory is that the rollup fails because there is no change to call refreshenv between the acceptance test and unit test runs.
2017-12-05T12:06:12 <the-t-in-rtf> although that doesn\'t seem to match what\'s in the docs.
2017-12-05T12:32:54 <yuriy__> Bosmon: we have a question for when you have some time. Yesterday on the status call, Gregg requested that the build we deliver is not a dev one, i.e. that it doesn\'t include the items in the context menu that are specific to the dev build like the key in or quit. We were contemplating modifying/duplicating the production config to include the hardcoded data just for our branch for jhernandez to make the final usability build from that config file. But
2017-12-05T12:32:54 <yuriy__> we wanted to run this idea by you before we make any changes, in case we are missing something important.
2017-12-05T12:33:37 <Bosmon> yuriy__ - yes, it looks like we need 3 configs
2017-12-05T12:33:48 <Bosmon> dev, testing and production
2017-12-05T12:40:23 <jhernandez> yuriy__: I already did that modification locally
2017-12-05T12:41:29 <jhernandez> and it works fine, I couldn\'t spot any problem
2017-12-05T12:42:11 <yuriy__> great, thank you, jhernandez!
2017-12-05T12:42:27 <jhernandez> so far, it\'s using the dynamic device reporter and I can see the liveness and OSRestart thing
2017-12-05T12:43:37 <jhernandez> let me create a pull request so you can give it a quick test and merge if okay
2017-12-05T12:45:48 <jhernandez> Bosmon: in fact, I don\'t think we don\'t need a "testing" config (right now) since Gregg wants the installer to use exactly the same config as in production
2017-12-05T12:46:04 <jhernandez> *I don\'t think we need
2017-12-05T12:46:53 <jhernandez> maybe we will need it by the time when we are going to start dealing with the "cloud"
2017-12-05T12:47:06 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I don\'t think in production we will have fake settings that claim that they trigger an OS restart : P
2017-12-05T12:47:16 <Bosmon> So let us continue with separate naming for the configs as above
2017-12-05T12:49:17 <jhernandez> but given what we have right now, there won\'t be any difference between the two configs (testing and production) right now, that\'s my point
2017-12-05T12:49:44 <jhernandez> I guess that will do after some code refactoring
2017-12-05T12:50:41 <jhernandez> well, it doesn\'t matter
2017-12-05T12:51:12 <jhernandez> I\'ll create the pull request and provide the link
2017-12-05T12:54:52 <kasparnet> jhernandez, Bosmon : looking at the high contraast issue, besides the fact that the windows contrast solution didn\'t have a "update" directive, there is a deeper issue with the composite preference paths (i.e. http://../Solution.http://registry.../someTerm
2017-12-05T12:56:27 <kasparnet> I *think* I can hack it to work relatively quick (1 hour\'ish), whereas fixing it properly I *think* I\'ll be able to do today, but I\'m not entirely sure
2017-12-05T12:56:37 <kasparnet> (I have a hard deadline at 17:45 today)
2017-12-05T12:57:57 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I also have to stop at 18:00-ish today
2017-12-05T12:58:10 <jhernandez> no prob
2017-12-05T12:58:47 <kasparnet> Any thoughts on which I should go for -- getting it hacky-fixed for sure, or doing it properly (in a not 100% sure I\'ll make it by EOD)?

2017-12-05T13:01:36 <Bosmon> kasparnet - hacky-fixed for sure is good I think
2017-12-05T13:01:47 <Bosmon> We need to deliver for testing tomorrow and then we\'ve got till January to fix it properly

2017-12-05T13:02:23 <jhernandez> right
2017-12-05T13:03:04 <kasparnet> Bosmon, alrighty
2017-12-05T13:03:31 <jhernandez> but, will the "hacky-fix" be suitable for master? :)
2017-12-05T13:03:40 <Bosmon> jhernandez, no, it won\'t ...
2017-12-05T13:04:32 <jhernandez> okay, I was thinking about upcoming builds until this problem is properly fixed
2017-12-05T13:12:47 * stegru has quit
2017-12-05T13:20:16 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: I saw that you merged it already, but just realized that I should have ran tests before pushing - not sure whether they will pass
2017-12-05T13:20:59 <jhernandez> in any case, I see that it\'s already passing ci, we can adjust it if needed
2017-12-05T13:22:02 * stegru joined the channel
2017-12-05T13:22:37 <jhernandez> also, note that I\'m setting the default config to app.testing, not sure if you want that in your giant pull request
2017-12-05T13:24:47 <jhernandez> btw, georgitodorov and kasparnet, I added the required metadata to show the google dictionary
2017-12-05T13:25:19 <jhernandez> and the PSP disables it, but doesn\'t re-enables it

2017-12-05T10:04:33 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru or anyone working on Windows, the unit tests in master are broken.
2017-12-05T10:04:45 <stegru> :(
2017-12-05T10:04:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I was asked to update my pull to master and got an early Christmas present.
2017-12-05T10:04:55 <the-t-in-rtf> closeProcessByName fails
2017-12-05T10:05:15 <stegru> ok i\'ll look into it
2017-12-05T10:05:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.
2017-12-05T10:06:00 <the-t-in-rtf> good news, the acceptance tests do pass.
2017-12-05T10:06:38 <stegru> oh, happy sinterklaas
2017-12-05T10:06:58 <the-t-in-rtf> It would be if they didn\'t start with amplified music and dudes in blackface at 8 AM.
2017-12-05T10:07:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Thankfully my son is still oblivious.
2017-12-05T10:07:43 <stegru> ah yes
2017-12-05T10:13:11 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: , did you perform the usual provisioning of the VM?
2017-12-05T10:13:42 <stegru> the problem with this test is it requires an executable to be built
2017-12-05T10:13:54 <the-t-in-rtf> I ran vagrant up if that\'s what you mean.
2017-12-05T10:14:00 <the-t-in-rtf> from the windows repo.
2017-12-05T10:14:42 <stegru> could you have a look in windows/gpii/node_modules/processHandling/test for test-window.exe ?
2017-12-05T10:14:49 <the-t-in-rtf> This is the latest windows10-eval-x64-Apps.
2017-12-05T10:16:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah.  So I was testing my pull, and did in fact check out master in a separate directory within the VM for comparison.
2017-12-05T10:16:11 <the-t-in-rtf> what do I need to do to built the binary?
2017-12-05T10:16:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect there are further errors, even in my directory where the binary exists there are new failures.
2017-12-05T10:17:54 <stegru> so do you think they\'re failing because you\'re doing something unusual?
2017-12-05T10:18:09 * jhernandez_ has left the channel
2017-12-05T10:19:30 <the-t-in-rtf> no, there are additional errors once you get past the crash that occurs if the binary is missing, which I can see in my branch.
2017-12-05T10:19:44 <the-t-in-rtf> To make the conversation clearer, I will check out master in the host and spin up a vm from there.
2017-12-05T10:20:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I still think there needs to be info about building in general in the README.
2017-12-05T10:21:47 <stegru> you\'re right
2017-12-05T10:22:10 <stegru> this is what\'s in the source code:
2017-12-05T10:22:12 <stegru> * How to build:
2017-12-05T10:22:12 <stegru> *  Start "Visual C++ 2015 x86 Native Build Tools Command Prompt"
2017-12-05T10:22:12 <stegru> *    or run: %comspec% /k ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\\vcbuildtools.bat"" x86
2017-12-05T10:22:12 <stegru> *  Compile with: cl test-window.c
2017-12-05T10:22:33 <stegru> but it does get built during the provisioning
2017-12-05T10:23:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Just copying that up to the README or telling people to look at the comment would be good.
2017-12-05T10:24:08 * jhernandez joined the channel
2017-12-05T10:24:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean the README does mention vagrant, but doesn\'t say that that\'s a hard requirement.
2017-12-05T10:24:42 <the-t-in-rtf> although to be fair, it doesn\'t claim that you can run the tests once you run npm install.
2017-12-05T10:24:43 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-12-05T10:25:03 <the-t-in-rtf> This will become more important when my pull is merged, as there will suddenly be an npm test command.
2017-12-05T10:25:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I can in fact add the build note in that pull.
2017-12-05T10:25:38 <stegru> well, in that case it can be built as part of the npm test scripts?
2017-12-05T10:25:46 <the-t-in-rtf> absolutely.
2017-12-05T10:25:51 <the-t-in-rtf> now that I know about it... ;)
2017-12-05T10:26:29 <jhernandez> kasparnet, Bosmon: morning guys
2017-12-05T10:26:48 <Bosmon> Morning jhernandez
2017-12-05T10:26:52 <the-t-in-rtf> I will confirm test failures in a clean vm created from master first and then work on adding a build step.
2017-12-05T10:27:11 <jhernandez> I\'m around if you want to have a quick chat about the issues reported on the installer
2017-12-05T10:27:55 <kasparnet> morning
2017-12-05T10:28:15 <kasparnet> I\'m currently building gpii-app to try things out
2017-12-05T10:28:21 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-12-05T10:28:39 <Bosmon> Let\'s wait for that, I\'m just holding off a bit since I expect the alarm installer will disconnect the phone line for a bit shortly
2017-12-05T10:29:21 <jhernandez> Bosmon: let\'s hope that the alarm installer is not a spaniard ... :P
2017-12-05T10:29:31 <jhernandez> xDDD
2017-12-05T10:29:39 <kasparnet> lol
2017-12-05T10:29:41 <kasparnet> indeed
2017-12-05T10:29:56 <Bosmon> And show his traditional "relaxed urgency"? : P
2017-12-05T10:30:31 <Bosmon> jhernandez - can you reproduce any of the issues with high contrast?
2017-12-05T10:30:48 <jhernandez> Bosmon: which one exactly?
2017-12-05T10:30:56 <Bosmon> jhernandez - either of them :)
2017-12-05T10:31:04 <Bosmon> THat is, that Lynn says she can\'t turn high contrast off
2017-12-05T10:31:10 <Bosmon> And that changing high contrast theme does nothing
2017-12-05T10:31:18 <jhernandez> yes, same here
2017-12-05T10:31:22 <Bosmon> Oh wow
2017-12-05T10:31:27 <Bosmon> How can this be possible
2017-12-05T10:31:32 <Bosmon> Given we have unit tests for it :)
2017-12-05T10:31:38 <Bosmon> And acceptance tests
2017-12-05T10:32:32 <jhernandez> yup
2017-12-05T10:33:54 <jhernandez> I\'ve went through most of the issues and reproducing them
2017-12-05T10:34:01 <Bosmon> Amazing and bizarre
2017-12-05T10:34:07 <jhernandez> there are comments for almost everything
2017-12-05T10:34:16 <jhernandez> yes, pretty weird
2017-12-05T10:35:44 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: I think I can re-write that executable in node - so for now, dont worry about the building of it.
2017-12-05T10:35:52 <kasparnet> jhernandez, Bosmon : where are the logs stored when running via the gpii-app?
2017-12-05T10:36:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I assume in the user\'s "gpii" directory
2017-12-05T10:36:30 <Bosmon> stegru worked on this bit ...
2017-12-05T10:36:32 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, @stegru.
2017-12-05T10:36:52 <stegru> which bit?
2017-12-05T10:37:06 <stegru> i\'ve tainted most bits
2017-12-05T10:38:48 <jhernandez> kasparnet: look under your AppData folder, which is located in your user\'s folder
2017-12-05T10:39:00 <jhernandez> it\'s a hidden folder
2017-12-05T10:39:25 <stegru> %AppData%\\gpii
2017-12-05T10:39:41 <stegru> C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Roaming\\gpii
2017-12-05T10:40:01 <jhernandez> usually, logs are stored on Users/YOUR_USER/AppData/Roaming/gpii
2017-12-05T10:40:28 <jhernandez> Bosmon: mmm, I\'m seeing this when performing updates on highContrast
2017-12-05T10:40:45 <Bosmon> What are you ssing?
2017-12-05T10:40:48 <Bosmon> seeing
2017-12-05T10:41:03 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ll have to drop off for a bit, have to shut off the power to the ground floor
2017-12-05T10:41:59 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, I got your note a smidge late, with the binary built I still have two failures in the spi settings handler tests.
2017-12-05T10:42:19 <jhernandez> Bosmon: https://pastebin.com/q6shz283
2017-12-05T10:42:38 <jhernandez> kasparnet: ^
2017-12-05T10:42:45 <jhernandez> note the this setting "http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/applications/com\\\\.microsoft\\\\.windows\\\\.highContrast.http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/highContrastEnabled"
2017-12-05T10:42:48 <kasparnet> found logs and looking
2017-12-05T10:43:25 <kasparnet> jhernandez, that setting actually should be valid
2017-12-05T10:43:32 <jhernandez> really?
2017-12-05T10:43:35 <kasparnet> yes
2017-12-05T10:43:41 <jhernandez> .highContrast.http://?
2017-12-05T10:43:42 <kasparnet> it\'s a scoped common term
2017-12-05T10:44:15 <kasparnet> yeah, basically if you split it as an el-path (at the non-escaped .) you\'ll see that it\'s a solution block
2017-12-05T10:44:19 <kasparnet> with a common term inside it
2017-12-05T10:44:42 <kasparnet> which is how it looks in the NP set
2017-12-05T10:45:23 <jhernandez> if you say so ... in any case that looks weird to me
2017-12-05T10:45:53 <jhernandez> (and even suspicious) :P
2017-12-05T10:46:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Hmm.  @stegru, I don\'t see the unit test errors in a new Windows VM, so I\'ll abandon that line of inquiry for now.
2017-12-05T10:47:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect I just needed to add "refreshenv" to my pretest steps, as I am very commonly running repeated runs.
2017-12-05T10:48:43 <jhernandez> kasparnet: btw, as tip for debugging with logs - you can make the gpii-app to render the logs in the console rather than in a logfile. You can comment the require(logging.js) in main.js
2017-12-05T10:49:08 <the-t-in-rtf> It may be that refreshenv is not quite thorough enough, I still see the same two errors in both master and my repo (on that VM).  Recreating that to confirm.
2017-12-05T10:49:25 <kasparnet> jhernandez, ahhh, that\'s nice
2017-12-05T10:49:26 <kasparnet> cheers
2017-12-05T10:49:32 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if my tests pass after recreating the VM it\'s possible to get the VM into a state where refreshenv won\'t clean up between runs.
2017-12-05T10:50:26 <kasparnet> jhernandez, bosmon: Ok, so triaged the mssing dictionary control and the issue is that it is never sent to the PCP
2017-12-05T10:50:41 <jhernandez> kasparnet: is it missing the metadata?
2017-12-05T10:50:53 <jhernandez> sorry, couldn\'t deep dive into issues
2017-12-05T10:51:07 <kasparnet> haven\'t debugged the reason for it yet
2017-12-05T10:51:07 <kasparnet> doing so now
2017-12-05T10:52:19 <kasparnet> jhernandez, no worries, that\'s what we\'re doing now
2017-12-05T10:53:01 <jhernandez> okay, I guess that it\'ll require some adjustment given the form it takes
2017-12-05T10:53:10 <jhernandez> SupportTool: ["dictionary"]
2017-12-05T10:53:27 <jhernandez> dunno
2017-12-05T10:56:20 <jhernandez> kasparnet: whenever you have an idea of what\'s going on, comment on the ticket and/or create a JIRA
2017-12-05T10:56:32 <jhernandez> I only created a few of them
2017-12-05T10:56:46 <jhernandez> comment on the document, sorry
