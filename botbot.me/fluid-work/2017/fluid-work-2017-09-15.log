b'2017-09-15T19:21:37 <colinclark> yeah, I think there is a module for it
2017-09-15T19:21:39 <colinclark> let\'s see
2017-09-15T19:21:43 <stegru> but something somehow made me confident it\'s all do-able in node
2017-09-15T19:22:18 <colinclark> Hasn\'t had a release in a year
2017-09-15T19:22:19 <colinclark> https://www.npmjs.com/package/nfc
2017-09-15T19:23:04 <colinclark> this one is based on pcsc, I think: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nfc-pcsc
2017-09-15T19:23:30 <colinclark> So I guess PC/SC just doesn\'t support our Vaio\'s reader
2017-09-15T19:23:48 <stegru> that\'s right
2017-09-15T19:24:08 <colinclark> another, newer one: https://www.npmjs.com/package/libnfc-js
2017-09-15T19:24:14 <colinclark> which claims not yet to support Windows :(
2017-09-15T19:25:02 <colinclark> This is curious: https://www.npmjs.com/package/smartcardreader
2017-09-15T19:25:08 <colinclark> "This module is equivalent to node-nfc but designed to work specifically on Windows, 32 and 64 bit where node-nfc fails due to driver issues."
2017-09-15T19:27:36 <stegru> it doesn\'t seem very good.. having to poll the device
2017-09-15T19:28:46 <colinclark> awful
2017-09-15T19:28:58 <colinclark> node-nfc doesn\'t support writing, as well
2017-09-15T19:29:06 <colinclark> I mean, maybe we\'ll never write anything to a tag
2017-09-15T19:29:21 <colinclark> it may be that we\'ll just ship CSV files full of UUIDs to the vendor
2017-09-15T19:29:30 <colinclark> but it\'s always nice to have the ability if necessary
2017-09-15T19:30:01 <stegru> yes, I can see a potential need for it when enrolling new users
2017-09-15T19:33:22 <stegru> I think the best way, in terms of compatibility, is using the same API/method as sgithens\'s proximity reader for the nfc-only readers
2017-09-15T19:33:49 <stegru> It\'s provided by windows and supported by the manufacturer
2017-09-15T19:37:28 <colinclark> right
2017-09-15T19:37:31 <stegru> nfc-pcsc is the best looking one, for pc/sc.. even tested to work with ACR122
2017-09-15T19:37:32 <colinclark> that makes sense
2017-09-15T19:37:40 <colinclark> ok

2017-09-15T16:03:14 <jhernandez_> given that, I\'m thinking that maybe we should start considering having a VM that includes the UIO+ chrome extension after it is fully ready
2017-09-15T16:05:27 <jhernandez_> or at least, to make the extension available online so we can install it more easily

2017-09-15T17:28:54 <colinclark> ok
2017-09-15T17:28:58 <colinclark> thank you :)
2017-09-15T17:29:12 <colinclark> jhernandez_: Does it have any unit tests?
2017-09-15T17:29:41 <jhernandez_> colinclark: no, AFAIK none of our user listener have unit tests
2017-09-15T17:29:47 <jhernandez_> *user listeners
2017-09-15T17:29:52 <colinclark> ok cool
2017-09-15T17:30:40 <colinclark> I\'m trying to remember the history of this listener
2017-09-15T17:30:56 <colinclark> So I see that gloob imported it from a repo that stegru created
2017-09-15T17:31:05 <jhernandez_> right
2017-09-15T17:31:22 <colinclark> and am I right that this was one of these bits of code that was under sgithens\' stairs for a long time? :)
2017-09-15T17:31:25 <jhernandez_> and stegru\'s code is based on some sgithens\' code
2017-09-15T17:31:33 <colinclark> got it
2017-09-15T17:31:37 <jhernandez_> ;)
2017-09-15T17:31:55 <colinclark> And remind me why it is needed?
2017-09-15T17:32:03 <colinclark> I remember that it uses the newer Windows NFC APIs
2017-09-15T17:32:14 <colinclark> and it has to do with the type of reader in the Vaios?
2017-09-15T17:32:48 <colinclark> I love commit logs like "Made it compile and not crash" :)
2017-09-15T17:32:52 <colinclark> +1 for that
2017-09-15T17:33:55 <jhernandez_> xDD
2017-09-15T17:35:16 <jhernandez_> as you know, for the pilots we\'re using the VAIOs only
2017-09-15T17:35:24 <colinclark> yes
2017-09-15T17:35:35 <colinclark> I\'m more interested in the technology in this case
2017-09-15T17:35:37 <colinclark> Remind me what\'s technically different, jhernandez_. between the ACR122 readers we sometimes use and the ones built into the Vaios?
2017-09-15T17:35:39 <colinclark> if you know
2017-09-15T17:36:27 <jhernandez_> the only I can remember is that they are different
2017-09-15T17:36:35 <colinclark> ok, no problem
2017-09-15T17:36:46 <jhernandez_> and I guess that it\'s a matter of libraries
2017-09-15T17:36:52 <colinclark> ok
2017-09-15T17:37:17 <jhernandez_> the library we use to deal with ACR122 does not support the proximity listener
2017-09-15T17:38:03 <jhernandez_> or at least, this is what I vaguely remember about this
2017-09-15T17:38:46 <jhernandez_> s/proximity listener/VAIO\'s proximity device
2017-09-15T17:40:04 <colinclark> And do you think the reverse is also true?
2017-09-15T17:40:14 <colinclark> That the Windows proximity APIs doesn\'t support the ACR122?
2017-09-15T17:42:26 * Justin_o has quit
2017-09-15T17:45:36 <jhernandez_> you caught me here
2017-09-15T17:45:59 <colinclark> :)
2017-09-15T17:46:18 <jhernandez_> but I think that it may be the case, that the underlying libraries doesn\'t work with those readers
2017-09-15T17:48:45 <jhernandez_> but probably it\'s a better question for sgithens or even stegru
2017-09-15T17:49:55 <jhernandez_> I can\'t find anything in the MS documentation about supported nfc/rfid chips/readers
2017-09-15T17:53:17 <jhung> michelled, colinclark, gtirloni: I was going to create a new repo for the BIG IDeA theme. Is the inclusive-design project space appropriate?
2017-09-15T18:00:54 <mrtyler> i look forward to the day when we have a test that includes a robot arm waving a preferences card over an nfc reader :)
2017-09-15T18:01:17 <gtirloni> jhung: the inclusive-design org seems appropriate to me
2017-09-15T18:02:11 <grrrero> jhung: Btw I have a PR for the Responsive Wordpress UIO if you don\'t mind checking out!! https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/pull/5
2017-09-15T18:02:11 <michelled> yes, sounds good jhung
2017-09-15T18:03:20 <jhung> grrrero: yep. I saw that. I won\'t be able to get to that until later next week. I have a couple things to get done before that. I spoke to Justin_o and michelled about the timing and it seemed okay that I get to it later.
2017-09-15T18:03:31 <grrrero> jhung: Ok sounds good!
2017-09-15T18:03:34 <jhung> thanks gtirloni and michelled.
2017-09-15T18:08:29 * kasparne_ has quit
2017-09-15T18:47:50 <stegru> colinclark: no, the proximity listener doesn\'t work with the ACR122 (haven\'t tried!) - it appears as a smartcard reader, rather than an NFC sensor
2017-09-15T19:11:49 <colinclark> stegru, jhernandez_: So do you figure, if we wanted to create a "universal" NFC User Listener for Windows, that it would need to combine both APIs\xe2\x80\x94the promixity APIs in Windows and whatever libraries are used to read from the family of readers like the ACR122?
2017-09-15T19:12:22 <colinclark> I also can\'t remember if anyone has investigated the viability of any of the Node.js libraries for NFC
2017-09-15T19:12:47 <colinclark> or if we think we\'re best to use Edge.js or something similar to bridge between our C# code and Node, if we\'re going to fold the readers into the same process as the GPII app
2017-09-15T19:12:55 <colinclark> anyone have any thoughts on this?
2017-09-15T19:14:52 <stegru> i think sgithens had some PoC code that does it in node
2017-09-15T19:14:57 <colinclark> oh wow
2017-09-15T19:15:06 <colinclark> stegru: I\'m hesitant to even ask...
2017-09-15T19:15:14 <colinclark> but do you have any idea where I might find the PoC?
2017-09-15T19:15:25 <stegru> which uses libNFC.. which I believe sheilds us from the two differences
2017-09-15T19:15:28 <colinclark> on a Vaio under the stairs somewhere?
2017-09-15T19:15:30 <colinclark> ah, fascinating
2017-09-15T19:15:40 <stegru> could be wrong.. hold on
2017-09-15T19:15:56 <colinclark> this libnfc: https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc
2017-09-15T19:16:26 <colinclark> Does anyone know the name of the sort of technology that is embedded into the Vaio? Is there a brand or chipset for the reader?
2017-09-15T19:16:37 <colinclark> I\'m sorry to be asking so many rookie questions
2017-09-15T19:16:43 <colinclark> especially late on Friday night :)
2017-09-15T19:16:59 <stegru> "nfc sensor", I think
2017-09-15T19:17:06 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-09-15T19:17:20 <stegru> or "proximity device"
2017-09-15T19:17:56 <stegru> I can\'t find that code, but I have seen it with my own eyes
2017-09-15T19:19:22 <colinclark> " The ACS readers currently only support the PC/SC stack, so they wont be able to work on Win8 as a proximity device. Even with Win7 we can only use PC/SC; the ACS drivers do not expose the underlying NFC operations on the chip." - Craig Tadlock, CEO - GOTOTAGS and BUYNFCTAGS
2017-09-15T19:19:39 <colinclark> but this was years ago
2017-09-15T19:20:08 <stegru> it should be possible to produce a wrapper that exposes it as an nfc device
2017-09-15T19:20:21 <colinclark> I wouldn\'t be surprised if ACS has done so since this quote from 2012
2017-09-15T19:20:32 <colinclark> Here\'s the thread I\'m reading: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/4776ed20-ab90-45ac-9d62-19f920d44905/proximity-device-external-reader-from-buynfctags?forum=windowsdeveloperpreviewgeneral
2017-09-15T19:20:47 <colinclark> But I guess if libNFC will shield us from a lot of this sort of thing, we should look there
2017-09-15T19:20:56 <colinclark> especially since it\'s at least nominally cross-platform

2017-09-15T08:31:17 <georgitodorov> Hi everyone! I was wondering if it is possible to have two model listeners defined for one and the same model property
2017-09-15T08:31:48 <georgitodorov> I thought I could use namespaces simiarly to registering other listeners for one and the same event but it appears that it is not the case
2017-09-15T08:40:52 <stegru> georgitodorov: here\'s how I\'ve listened to the same event twice (it\'s not a model listener)..
2017-09-15T08:40:54 <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/ded64a2fee0b202e1bf03529136b935c2003c394/gpii/node_modules/windowsMetrics/src/windowsMetrics.js#L52-L55
2017-09-15T08:44:57 <georgitodorov> Yeah. Is there something similar that can be used for model listeners?
2017-09-15T08:46:24 <stegru> I don\'t know about that - I\'ve not used a model listener before
2017-09-15T08:50:10 * javjarfer joined the channel
2017-09-15T08:51:31 <georgitodorov> oh, I got it - I simply have to define an array of listeners for the given property. Namespaces do not work here in the standard .<namespace_name> notation because they are interpreted as suproperties.

2017-09-15T11:48:20 <alanharnum> Automattic has announced they\'re dropping React from Wordpress due to the patent issues: https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/
2017-09-15T11:48:28 <alanharnum> "Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso \xe2\x80\x94 that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic\xe2\x80\x99s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn\xe2\x80\x99t somethi
2017-09-15T11:48:28 <alanharnum> ng I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable with."
2017-09-15T11:48:59 <alanharnum> I know the stat, but that "quarter of all websites" is always a bit mind-boggling
2017-09-15T11:57:52 <gtirloni> it\'s an interesting thing what\'s happening because of this license... even if the risk is low, it moves from mostly objective area with MIT/BSD/Apache to being totally subject and full of unknown variables with the patent clause... and people will react (pun not intended) differently. I agree with Automattic because it\'s not only an issue for themselves but for everybody out there and I\'d rather not get dragged in these discussion as well

2017-09-15T12:03:35 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov
2017-09-15T12:03:38 <Bosmon> Sorry to miss this question yesterday
2017-09-15T12:03:49 <Bosmon> You can write the "namespace" property out longhand in the listener block
2017-09-15T12:03:52 <Bosmon> Let me find the docs link for you
2017-09-15T12:04:54 <Bosmon> Yes, ok, this docs section could be clearer
2017-09-15T12:04:54 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ChangeApplierAPI.html#declarative-style-for-listening-to-changes
2017-09-15T12:05:32 <Bosmon> So at it says here, the key of the block is interpreted EITHER as a path, OR a namespace - depending on whether there is a namespace entry in the listener block or not
2017-09-15T12:05:42 <Bosmon> "The key for a modelListener will be interpreted as a <shortModelPathReference> if the modelListener declaration does not contain a member named path. If the modelListener declaration includes path, then the key will be interpreted as a namespace instead, unless the declaration includes a namespace member, which takes priority as defining the namespace."
2017-09-15T12:06:53 <Bosmon> Here\'s an example in the tests of exactly what you\'re trying to do - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/DataBindingTests.js#L716

2017-09-15T12:18:00 <alanharnum> gtirloni: yeah, it\'s very much one of those "perception = reality" in regards to open source adoption.
2017-09-15T12:18:46 <gtirloni> agreed
2017-09-15T12:19:46 <alanharnum> and people are (correctly) wary of open source efforts by big companies that have that feel of "open source, but..."
2017-09-15T12:20:13 <Justin_o> alanharnum, gtirloni: i don\'t think i understand the "patent" part.
2017-09-15T12:22:16 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I\'m not totally sure I do either - I haven\'t been following it too closely.
2017-09-15T12:22:23 <alanharnum> this quora seems to give a good range of opinions: https://www.quora.com/Are-people-really-worried-about-using-React-and-ReactNative-with-the-language-thats-in-Facebooks-PATENTS-file
2017-09-15T12:22:42 <alanharnum> i suspect, for many, it\'s the principle, and a lack of trust in Facebook\'s "we won\'t misuse this" position.
2017-09-15T12:23:00 <gtirloni> for reference: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/PATENTS#L14-L26
2017-09-15T12:24:07 <gtirloni> I like the opinion that if everybody had this, then nobody would sue anybody for sw patents and, I think, that would be better... but it\'s kind of a cold war situation. I understand it makes people nervous.. even more when it\'s not widespread yet
2017-09-15T12:25:29 <alanharnum> "patent" as a term also has extremely bad memories in those who\'ve been involved in open source since the early 2000s
2017-09-15T12:25:37 <gtirloni> yep
2017-09-15T12:25:43 <alanharnum> SCO, etc
2017-09-15T12:29:23 <gtirloni> i think this article explains it well: https://opensource.com/article/17/9/facebook-patents-license
2017-09-15T12:30:54 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame that there is a grammatical error right at the most vital part of the article : P
2017-09-15T12:30:56 <Bosmon> "and a separate grant to practice patents that read on the software"

2017-09-15T13:53:52 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: when you have time, do you mind reviewing this tiny pull request? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/551
2017-09-15T13:55:21 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - I dunno, how can it be tested? : P
2017-09-15T13:55:34 <jhernandez_> hmm
2017-09-15T13:56:16 <Bosmon> I mean, it might be a great pull request!
2017-09-15T13:56:20 <Bosmon> But I have no way of knowing
2017-09-15T13:56:29 <Bosmon> Other than that I guess the files parse as JSON : P
2017-09-15T13:56:30 <jhernandez_> I guess that you need to invest some time to get ready to test it, yes
2017-09-15T13:56:37 <jhernandez_> haha
2017-09-15T13:57:01 <jhernandez_> right, we might destroy the world with a tiny pull request
2017-09-15T13:57:03 <jhernandez_> xD
2017-09-15T13:57:35 <stegru> yeh javi... I put the fix at hst because that\'s what gpii-app points to
2017-09-15T13:57:53 <jhernandez_> you can use the windows vm to test it, and then, install the uio+ extension
2017-09-15T13:58:02 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-09-15T13:59:43 <jhernandez_> stegru: right, you created that branch first to test in gpii-app, but I was wondering whether that pull request can be against master instead
2017-09-15T13:59:57 <stegru> yes I\'m doing that now
2017-09-15T14:01:58 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: do you want me to add the steps in the description so you can test it?
2017-09-15T14:02:28 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ sure, unless it\'s clear enough from the JIRA
2017-09-15T14:03:42 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-09-15T14:04:01 <jhernandez_> actually, the JIRA explains the problem and the motivation of such update, but not the process to actually test it
2017-09-15T14:04:53 <colinclark> simonjb, Bosmon: Sorry I\'m late! Where would you like to meet?
2017-09-15T14:05:41 <simonjb> colinclark: vidyo?
2017-09-15T14:05:47 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - cool, in that case instructions would be great

2017-09-15T14:07:15 <simonjb> michelled: we\'re meeting in my Vidyo room
2017-09-15T14:07:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure, on my way
2017-09-15T14:07:26 <stegru> jhernandez_:  https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/148
2017-09-15T14:08:15 <michelled> simonjb: is it unlocked?
2017-09-15T14:08:26 <michelled> ah, worked now
2017-09-15T14:08:48 <Bosmon> gtirloni - we\'re getting a huge number of CI jobs which abort these days
2017-09-15T14:08:51 <Bosmon> Any ideas?
2017-09-15T14:09:36 <Bosmon> Although it\'s interesting they all abort at the same point
2017-09-15T14:09:38 <Bosmon> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/259/console
2017-09-15T14:09:51 <Bosmon> Perhaps it\'s not wise to launch LicencingUI.exe - what do you make of this, stegru ?
2017-09-15T14:10:12 <Bosmon> simonjb - sorry, Vidyo is hanging for me for some reason
2017-09-15T14:10:16 <Bosmon> Be there as soon as I can
2017-09-15T14:10:21 <colinclark> Bosmon: we\'re rescheduling anyway :)
2017-09-15T14:10:25 <Bosmon> !
2017-09-15T14:10:29 <Bosmon> Until when?
2017-09-15T14:10:39 <colinclark> next week, at your convenience
2017-09-15T14:10:42 <Bosmon> ouch
2017-09-15T14:10:49 <stegru> I didn\'t launch it, Bosmon.. that\'s a report that it\'s *been* launched - it\'s windows complaining about the expiring license
2017-09-15T14:11:03 <Bosmon> Oh interesting
2017-09-15T14:11:09 <simonjb> sorry Bosmon, I got a migraine yesterday and am feeling not completely present today
2017-09-15T14:11:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - so sorry to hear that
2017-09-15T14:11:27 <Bosmon> Hope it will clear up soon
2017-09-15T14:11:43 <colinclark> I wonder if we should set a date in the calendar well before the LicencingUI.exe application starts being launched? :)
2017-09-15T14:11:50 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, I\'ll be better soon :)
2017-09-15T14:11:59 <colinclark> amatas: Do you have a schedule that you\'re tracking in terms of knowing when to build new VMs?
2017-09-15T14:12:14 <Bosmon> stegru, gtirloni - well it\'s interesting that we get the abort at the same time in each launch
2017-09-15T14:13:03 <amatas> colinclark: I didn\'t, but I\'m planning to trigger one new build every 2 months
2017-09-15T14:13:16 <colinclark> Can you automate this somehow?
2017-09-15T14:13:25 <colinclark> Or put it in the GPII calendar so it is very prominent?
2017-09-15T14:13:57 <amatas> I can automate the process of building, but the upload to the Vagrant Hub is manual
2017-09-15T14:14:02 <colinclark> right
2017-09-15T14:14:14 <amatas> it doesn\'t take much time, but it has to be manually uploaded
2017-09-15T14:14:43 <amatas> I think that we can start with an event on the GPII calendar
