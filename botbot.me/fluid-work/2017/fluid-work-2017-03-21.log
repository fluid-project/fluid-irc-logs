b'2017-03-21T17:53:20 <Bosmon> I mean, this is obvious because the environment reported could only meaningfully be a *local* environmental reporter

2017-03-21T18:07:02 <cindyli> Bosmon: probably that chunk of the context manager code should only be deployed with the local flow manger instead of cloud based flow manager, even for untrusted flow manager if we make sure "activeContextName, activeConfiguration" added by the context manager never gets used in cloud
2017-03-21T18:11:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: no, "activeConfiguration" does get used later at cloud based flow manager for generating life cycle instructions https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerRequests.js#L100

2017-03-21T18:13:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - it is used, but only to set the context "gpii-default"
2017-03-21T18:13:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: i may not understand it correctly, but it seems the context manager is not only in charge of detecting the context change, it\'s also responsible for generating the active match based on the current context. and the latter is required by the cloud based flow manager
2017-03-21T18:14:09 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-03-21T18:14:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, the context manager has only ever been "academic quality code"
2017-03-21T18:14:27 <Bosmon> It is something we threw together to demonstrate a feature to the C4A partners
2017-03-21T18:14:35 <Bosmon> But its actual behaviour in a real setting has never been thought through
2017-03-21T18:14:52 <cindyli> ah ok
2017-03-21T18:15:03 <Bosmon> So we should be careful in advertising it as a part of the GPII architecture
2017-03-21T18:15:04 <colinclark> but it can tell the time
2017-03-21T18:15:09 <Bosmon> I mean, structurally, it is there
2017-03-21T18:15:17 <Bosmon> But all the parts of it are not factored or organised correctly
2017-03-21T18:15:59 <Bosmon> But certainly, the intention of the current plan, as we determined in that Cambridge 2015 meeting, was for contexts to be evaluated locally
2017-03-21T18:16:08 * stegru has quit
2017-03-21T18:16:14 <cindyli> ok. shall i remove it from the payloads doc?
2017-03-21T18:16:27 <Bosmon> And it seems we have somewhat forgotten about this intention as we implemented the "untrusted local flowManager"
2017-03-21T18:16:28 <cindyli> even tho it does perform a step ;)
2017-03-21T18:16:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess you can leave it, but just with a comment that it is a provisional part of the architecture
2017-03-21T18:17:06 <Bosmon> And you should rename the confusing name "Cloud-based context manager"
2017-03-21T18:17:19 <cindyli> what to rename to?
2017-03-21T18:17:25 <Bosmon> It\'s simply the context manager, I think
2017-03-21T18:17:26 <cindyli> context matching
2017-03-21T18:17:29 <cindyli> ok
2017-03-21T18:17:34 <Bosmon> Just call it whatever it is called in the code
2017-03-21T18:17:39 <Bosmon> So that people know where to find it : P
2017-03-21T18:17:52 <cindyli> sounds good
2017-03-21T18:18:43 <Bosmon> As it turns out, it is indeed currently deployed in the cloud, but this is just totally an accident of the way we factored out the untrusted flow manager and is not something we should talk about
2017-03-21T18:19:16 <Bosmon> That is, talk about to people outside the team who we are trying to explain the architecture to : P
2017-03-21T18:26:18 <cindyli> Bosmon: corrected and pushed

2017-03-21T13:15:45 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, @gtirloni, I am trying to reproduce some problems using the Windows 7 VM, and having difficulty finding a chocolatey package with a working vcbuild.exe
2017-03-21T13:15:47 <the-t-in-rtf> any tips?
2017-03-21T13:16:05 <the-t-in-rtf> the VM includes microsoft-build-tools already
2017-03-21T13:16:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ve also tried microsoft-visual-cpp-build-tools and vcbuildtools
2017-03-21T13:17:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I tried both of those with the /Full installation option.
2017-03-21T13:18:10 <the-t-in-rtf> It may be a pathing thing, but I really want something that I can set up just a series of commands in a QI config file.
2017-03-21T13:18:14 <gtirloni> hi tony, you could try one of the sdk\'s (https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=windows-sdk) or visualcppbuiuldtools (https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=visualcppbuildtools). i\'m not sure which packages the win7 box is including, amatas can probably comment on that
2017-03-21T13:18:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks @gtirloni, I can try the visualcppbuildtools package
2017-03-21T13:19:01 <gtirloni> this is what we do to update the environment -- https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Build.ps1#L29
2017-03-21T13:19:42 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Build.ps1#L34
2017-03-21T13:20:09 <gtirloni> i *think* those two add all the path\'s and env vars necessary..
2017-03-21T13:26:31 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-03-21T13:29:55 <the-t-in-rtf> I already had visualcppbuildtools installed
2017-03-21T13:30:03 <the-t-in-rtf> calling those files before running npm doesn\'t help.
2017-03-21T13:38:39 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: that msvs_version command might be useful too: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Npm.ps1#L8
2017-03-21T13:38:48 <gtirloni> other than that, i\'m out of ideas.. i\'d wait for alfredo

2017-03-21T13:45:32 <amatas> Hi!
2017-03-21T13:45:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for the comments on escaping, @amatas
2017-03-21T13:46:14 <amatas> I\'m booting a win7, I don\'t remember the compiler that we used to build binaries in win 7
2017-03-21T13:46:16 <amatas> yw!
2017-03-21T13:46:18 <the-t-in-rtf> That and the suggestions from @stegru should give me what I need to run the tests.
2017-03-21T13:46:31 <amatas> awesome
2017-03-21T13:46:52 <the-t-in-rtf> We should all still review the workaround, as it may be that this pattern (mounting the share as a named drive) is more widely useful.
2017-03-21T13:47:21 <stegru> by the way, I think this is a flaw in cmd, not fluid.require

2017-03-21T14:15:33 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, regarding the building of binaries
2017-03-21T14:15:40 <amatas> could you try installing msbuild.extensionpack
2017-03-21T14:15:47 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, not sure I follow.  These are tests that run from any shell you like, as long as the content is hosted on a Windows FS.  They don\'t run when they\'re stored on a shared volume coming from a non-windows VM host.
2017-03-21T14:15:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @amatas, I will try that.
2017-03-21T14:16:12 <amatas> and invoking the script C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools\\vcbuildtools_msbuild.bat before the builds
2017-03-21T14:16:14 <the-t-in-rtf> I had to blow away the old VM, though, as all the variations on Visual Studio basically filled up my host hard drive.
2017-03-21T14:16:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I tried the latter without luck.
2017-03-21T14:16:29 <amatas> you should have msbuild command available
2017-03-21T14:16:33 <the-t-in-rtf> I do.
2017-03-21T14:16:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Just not vcbuild
2017-03-21T14:17:34 <amatas> mmm
2017-03-21T14:17:59 <amatas> we don\'t use vcbuild in our builds
2017-03-21T14:18:04 <amatas> let me see
2017-03-21T14:18:59 * kavya joined the channel
2017-03-21T14:20:22 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, which module needs the command vcbuild?
2017-03-21T14:23:28 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: tony, I beleive the "CMD doesn\'t support UNC paths" error is what\'s causing problems. something (fluid.require?) is resolving the c:\\vagrant symlink to "\\\\vboxsvr\\vagrant\\...", and something has chdir\'d to it, but that type of path isn\'t supported by cmd
2017-03-21T14:24:17 <stegru> for win7, i just build with win10
2017-03-21T14:30:00 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, this also happens when running from a mounted drive, not just from the symlink.
2017-03-21T14:30:52 <stegru> do you still get the UNC path error, the-t-in-rtf ?

2017-03-21T17:21:30 <Bosmon> "Cloud-based context manager"?
2017-03-21T17:21:35 <Bosmon> I wasn\'t aware we had any such thing
2017-03-21T17:22:02 <cindyli> it means the context manager running on the gpii cloud
2017-03-21T17:22:19 <cindyli> let\'s find a better name for it
2017-03-21T17:22:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - the name makes perfect sense
2017-03-21T17:22:31 <cindyli> the context manager can also run on the local gpii
2017-03-21T17:22:34 <Bosmon> It\'s the actual thing I am puzzled about
2017-03-21T17:22:42 <Bosmon> What configuration do we have a use for a cloud-based context manager?
2017-03-21T17:23:02 <cindyli> checking...
2017-03-21T17:23:11 <Bosmon> The whole point of contexts as designed in the current GPII was that they would be evaluated locally
