2017-03-28T13:19:57 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli (and others), I am having trouble getting the universal node tests to finish.
2017-03-28T13:20:16 <the-t-in-rtf> which config should the tests use?
2017-03-28T13:20:33 <the-t-in-rtf> tests/configs/gpii.tests.acceptance.untrusted.development.config.json  ?
2017-03-28T13:21:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I also wonder what people have their NODE_ENV set to.
2017-03-28T13:21:31 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: no config file needs to be specified at running node tests
2017-03-28T13:21:38 <cindyli> checking mine
2017-03-28T13:21:53 <the-t-in-rtf> The tests seem to be picking up NODE_ENV and looking for a different config file.
2017-03-28T13:21:59 <cindyli> mine is empty by default
2017-03-28T13:22:15 <the-t-in-rtf> What version of node/npm?
2017-03-28T13:22:37 <cindyli> node 6.7.0, npm 3.10.3
2017-03-28T13:22:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m using 6.9.1 and 3.10.3
2017-03-28T13:22:53 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: can you override NODE_ENV to empty at running node tests
2017-03-28T13:22:54 <the-t-in-rtf> If I unset the variable, the path ends up having "none" in it and not working.
2017-03-28T13:23:23 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, trying setting it to an empty string.
2017-03-28T13:27:04 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, empty string works.
2017-03-28T13:27:17 <the-t-in-rtf> out of curiosity, if you type "unset NODE_ENV" and then run the tests, what happens on your machine?
2017-03-28T13:27:38 <the-t-in-rtf> on mine, it throws an ENOENT error when looking for the startup test configs.
2017-03-28T13:27:51 <cindyli> trying
2017-03-28T13:29:31 <cindyli> so far so good. running all-tests.js, half of the tests have passed
2017-03-28T13:29:36 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: are you running it like `node tests/all-tests.js` ? i don\'t have NODE_ENV set.
2017-03-28T13:29:56 <cindyli> gtirloni: i was running that command

2017-03-28T15:37:56 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni, yes, and I get failures whether NODE_ENV is unset or set to something empty.
2017-03-28T15:38:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open \'/Users/duhrer/Source/rtf/universal.the-t-in-rtf/node_modules/universal/none/gpii.tests.acceptance.localInstall.config.json\'
2017-03-28T15:38:19 <the-t-in-rtf> See the "none" bit.
2017-03-28T15:38:47 <the-t-in-rtf> If I set NODE_ENV, it will suddenly correctly pick up "tests" instead of "none", but the filename will change.
2017-03-28T15:40:10 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: we are planning to upgrade the GPII\'s Jira, I saw your mail http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2017-March/010346.html . Do you have any concerns about updating it to the latest version (7.3.3) ?
2017-03-28T15:44:03 <amatas> did you have time to test the new editor?

2017-03-28T15:58:17 <cindyli> jhung: do you wanna have a quick vidyo chat?
2017-03-28T15:58:23 <jhung> sure cindyli

2017-03-28T16:45:24 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, yes, I tested the new editor and posted on list about my experience.
2017-03-28T16:45:35 <the-t-in-rtf> My concerns haven\'t changed.
2017-03-28T16:45:54 <the-t-in-rtf> I would suggest replying to that note and confirming that everyone is OK with the "opt out" in the new editor.
2017-03-28T16:46:17 <the-t-in-rtf> My gut feel is that we need to watch new releases and be sure with each release that "opt out" is still possible.
2017-03-28T16:46:35 <the-t-in-rtf> That may require a bit more than just reading release notes, i.e. upgrading a staging instance or trying it out on a local machine first.
2017-03-28T16:46:43 <the-t-in-rtf> This release, we know what\'s up.

2017-03-28T17:02:10 <amatas> I guess that we can upgrade to 7.2.8 which doesn\'t have the new editor
