2017-02-20T15:10:47 <Bosmon> Hey there kasparnet
2017-02-20T15:10:56 <Bosmon> Could I bump this one up your queue?
2017-02-20T15:10:57 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/501
2017-02-20T15:11:00 <kasparnet> Bosmon:
2017-02-20T15:11:11 <kasparnet> yes
2017-02-20T15:11:21 <Bosmon> cheers!
2017-02-20T15:19:00 <Bosmon> Also whilst you are all matchmakery, here is a little one for you:
2017-02-20T15:19:01 <Bosmon> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2297

2017-02-20T16:21:28 <colinclark> Bosmon, kasparnet: We\'re just talking about "continuous deployment" here in Maryland\xe2\x80\x94about how we\'d eventually like to get to a situation where, when all unit and integration tests pass upon a merge, our cloud infrastructure is automatically updated with the latest code
2017-02-20T16:21:52 <colinclark> obviously this depends crucially on much more "accurate" test environments
2017-02-20T16:22:20 <colinclark> and I wonder, from your perspective, whether you feel any particular attachment to running "full stack" integration tests wholly on your local machine
2017-02-20T16:22:33 <Bosmon> Yes, a strong one
2017-02-20T16:22:40 <colinclark> as opposed to doing some with some cloud services that will be provisioned and destroyed as part of your test run
2017-02-20T16:22:52 <colinclark> what\'s the motivation for doing it all locally?
2017-02-20T16:22:59 <Bosmon> The motivation is to be able to be sure that it works
2017-02-20T16:23:02 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-02-20T16:23:07 <Bosmon> Sorry to be so blunt
2017-02-20T16:23:08 <Bosmon> But there it is
2017-02-20T16:23:08 <colinclark> I think you\'d better elaborate a bit :)
2017-02-20T16:23:15 <colinclark> I like to code on planes, so I mildly prefer an offline situation
2017-02-20T16:23:18 <Bosmon> I can\'t see any other way of looking at the issue
2017-02-20T16:23:31 <colinclark> I don\'t know what that means
2017-02-20T16:23:36 * kasparnet has quit
2017-02-20T16:23:46 <Bosmon> If I can\'t do something myself, I have no way of taking responsibility for knowing that it works
2017-02-20T16:23:50 <colinclark> right
2017-02-20T16:23:58 <Bosmon> Which is part of my responsibilities as a code reviewer
2017-02-20T16:24:00 <colinclark> but does "doing it yourself" mean "totally offline"
2017-02-20T16:24:14 <Bosmon> What does "offline" mean?
2017-02-20T16:24:18 <Bosmon> Without net access?
2017-02-20T16:24:20 <colinclark> yes
2017-02-20T16:24:29 <Bosmon> I\'ve got no attachment to that
2017-02-20T16:24:30 <colinclark> ok
2017-02-20T16:24:31 <colinclark> good
2017-02-20T16:24:46 <Bosmon> What would the access be used for?
2017-02-20T16:24:58 <colinclark> well, ok
2017-02-20T16:25:03 <colinclark> Let me try to explain
2017-02-20T16:25:04 <Bosmon> It\'s already, in practice, used for resolving npm packaging so it doesn\'t represent any particular loss as far as I can see
2017-02-20T16:25:16 <colinclark> we will have servers :P
2017-02-20T16:25:39 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-02-20T16:25:47 <colinclark> and we will have automation scripts
2017-02-20T16:25:53 <colinclark> they will utlimately orchestrate the deployment of THE ACTUAL preferences server, couch DB, and CBFM containers with load balancers, etc.
2017-02-20T16:26:38 <colinclark> we will have test environment provisioners that will setup "a" preferences server, "a" couddb container, and "a" cbfm container
2017-02-20T16:26:57 <colinclark> the question is whether anyone cares whether those containers are actually physically deployed ON their development machine
2017-02-20T16:27:07 <colinclark> or instead in a "development scratchpad" environment in "the cloud"
2017-02-20T16:27:09 <colinclark> lots of quotes
2017-02-20T16:27:13 <colinclark> hopefully I\'m making more sense
2017-02-20T16:27:30 <Bosmon> !
2017-02-20T16:27:54 <Bosmon> Well yes, I do
2017-02-20T16:28:01 <colinclark> yes you do what?
2017-02-20T16:28:13 <Bosmon> We need total access to these machines, in order to fully investigate and characterise failures, right?
2017-02-20T16:28:39 <colinclark> well "total access" in a containerized environment is somewhat interesting
2017-02-20T16:28:49 <Bosmon> I thought it might be .....
2017-02-20T16:29:09 <colinclark> we will eventually move to a completely automated container environment, in which essentially no one has "access" to those containers
2017-02-20T16:29:17 <Bosmon> Ah
2017-02-20T16:29:23 <colinclark> but they will be fully instrumented for logging and monitoring
2017-02-20T16:29:25 <Bosmon> That\'s the opposite of what I was expecting you were going to say :)
2017-02-20T16:29:32 <colinclark> ha :)
2017-02-20T16:29:55 <colinclark> I mean, I think it\'s typical for containerized environments to be totally "fire and forget" and if there\'s a problem, you destroy the node and recreate it
2017-02-20T16:29:58 <Bosmon> I was expecting you to say "Our completely automated container arguments are so ludicrously abstracted that the ops team has no problem handing out root level shell access to them" : P
2017-02-20T16:30:12 <colinclark> that may be true at some level
2017-02-20T16:30:25 <colinclark> but I think it\'s pretty typical for no one to have shell access
2017-02-20T16:34:47 <colinclark> that\'s in the long term, gtirloni is telling me :)
2017-02-20T16:35:10 <Bosmon> In the long term it\'s typical for noone to have shell access?
2017-02-20T16:35:19 * amatas joined the channel
2017-02-20T16:35:26 <colinclark> yes
2017-02-20T16:35:50 <colinclark> right ow, we have "mutable" containers
2017-02-20T16:36:12 <Bosmon> And what would be the solution for remoting on Windows?
2017-02-20T16:36:25 <Bosmon> I guess I\'ve used a couple ....
2017-02-20T16:38:10 <Bosmon> But, presumably given all of the containerization technologies we\'d be running would be freely licenced, presumably I could run THOSE on my local machine
2017-02-20T16:38:22 <Bosmon> Although I imagine I\'d struggle to run them on a Windows 7 machine .....
2017-02-20T16:38:38 <Bosmon> I accept that this is my own personal source of blunders : P
2017-02-20T16:39:29 <Bosmon> Wouldn\'t the ops team\'s own containerization system just be stored in a vagrant vm? : P
2017-02-20T16:39:31 * ravinduperera joined the channel
2017-02-20T16:39:43 <ravinduperera> hi
2017-02-20T16:40:39 <colinclark> Bosmon: yes to your questions :P
2017-02-20T16:40:48 <colinclark> I mean, Docker runs on Windows
2017-02-20T16:40:54 <colinclark> possibly not your Windows :P
2017-02-20T16:41:04 <colinclark> and yes, one could provision Docker into a Linux vagrant VM
2017-02-20T16:41:12 <colinclark> and that may happen
2017-02-20T16:41:13 <Bosmon> ok
2017-02-20T16:41:16 <Bosmon> Sounds promising
2017-02-20T16:41:32 <colinclark> or it may be that you interact FULLY with Docker containers running in your "developer space"
2017-02-20T16:41:38 <gtirloni> Bosmon: hi! just catching up on the chat... if you can download and run this thing called \'minikube\' it would give you transparent access to a Docker engine and a Kubernetes API server.. https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases (so no need for vagrant in that case, in that _specific_ case.. which doesn\'t include desktop apps)
2017-02-20T16:42:16 <Bosmon> gtirloni - sadly, writing Windows desktop apps is the primary business we\'re in :)
2017-02-20T16:42:23 <ravinduperera> Hi i am Ravindu and i am interested on Interactive "Flowers and Petals" Inclusive Design tool project for gsoc can i know more information about this project
2017-02-20T16:42:29 <Bosmon> At least it is this year
2017-02-20T16:42:44 <gtirloni> Bosmon: yeah, i\'m proposing a "split world" approach to that.. make it complex where it\'s needed (as opposed to our current approach to unify it all)
2017-02-20T16:43:33 <Bosmon> I fondly remember the days (years) when we said things like "We write exclusively for the portable web" ......
2017-02-20T16:45:58 <ravinduperera> Hi i am Ravindu and i am interested on Interactive "Flowers and Petals" Inclusive Design tool project for gsoc can i know more information about this project
2017-02-20T16:48:43 <Bosmon> gtirloni - at what level would the split occur?
2017-02-20T16:52:42 <gtirloni> Bosmon: in the choice of deployment technologies. the desktop apps need a VM while the microservices can live in containers (and here there\'s an additional requirement coming from production: they are easier/faster to manage/deploy/build that way). still fuzzy on the details, but trying to keep that separate to avoid overengineering where things should be simpler. i guess my opinion is that we are having a lot of trouble with deploying
2017-02-20T16:52:42 <gtirloni> these microservices but they are super simple.. it shouldn\'t be that way :)still fuzzy on the details

Anyone knows what happened with the method "processesBridge.hasSwitchRunState", present in this pull request https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/82, it looks like it was moved to this branch https://github.com/klown/windows/tree/GPII-442-trackState, but I can\'t find the definition there also
