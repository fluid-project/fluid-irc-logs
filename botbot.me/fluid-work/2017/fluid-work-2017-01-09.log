2017-01-09T19:08:59 <Khushil_> Hey..Khushil here..I was playing with infusion for past few days. I was exploring its documentation and tutorials. It was quite fun. I had some difficulties with Rendered components. For given documentation, Should I use fluid_1_5 or fluid 2_0_0 for Rendere components\'s feasibility ?

2017-01-09T19:12:15 <colinclark> Khushil_: I think you\'ll find that in general it\'s best to use the latest stable release\xe2\x80\x94so in this case, Infusion 2.0.0

2017-01-09T19:19:18 <Khushil__> Okay. Cool. I am planning to built small app with infusion now. It will be about weight of human on different planets. Also will add some more atributes so that Ican have good idea of models and try to rendere some images of different planets. Its very basic idea but I think I should give it a try.

2017-01-09T21:04:59 <michelled> alanharnum: you had mentioned that you had got some feedback on the ILDH from an educator
2017-01-09T21:05:17 <michelled> were there specific things we should JIRA up and plan to do over the next little while
2017-01-09T21:05:18 <michelled> ?
2017-01-09T21:06:12 <Kobi> Justin_o: is it alright if David123_ and I head out?
2017-01-09T21:06:26 <alanharnum> michelled: the most concrete thing I can think of is doing some kind of "pathways" type structure to create access points for various target audiences
2017-01-09T21:06:43 <alanharnum> michelled: I\'ll ask if I can forward his feedback on to others
2017-01-09T21:10:13 <michelled> thx alanharnum
2017-01-09T21:10:13 <mrtyler> heh, so am i understanding correctly that i cannot set a password for vidyo? i can only say i forgot it and have it email(!) me a new randomly-chosen password?
2017-01-09T21:17:18 <avtar> mrtyler: you have to right click on the systray icon (or the dock icon on os x?) and select \'manage account\'
2017-01-09T21:18:02 <avtar> which directs you to the web interface of the vidyo portal the client is currently configured to use

2017-01-09T21:23:07 <avtar> sweet :D
2017-01-09T21:23:09 <mrtyler> the instructions said to use the forgot password form, and i would have never thought to do it through a right click on the app in the dock
2017-01-09T21:23:24 <mrtyler> cuz, y\'know, why make a menu option?
2017-01-09T21:23:30 <avtar> yeah, i\'m not sure how i discovered that either
2017-01-09T21:24:22 <mrtyler> hmm, what else can i do with right-click... Send Avtar Camel Spiders
2017-01-09T21:24:26 <mrtyler> what does that one do i wonder?
2017-01-09T21:25:50 <avtar> my windows usually get closed at the mention of * spiders
2017-01-09T21:25:57 <mrtyler> (btw if you are squeamish, do not look up videos of camel spiders)
2017-01-09T21:26:03 <avtar> too late :/

2017-01-09T15:46:40 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: I don\'t think we have, but do you know if we do or should target an ecmascript version like we do for browsers
2017-01-09T15:46:50 <Justin_o> also, maybe we should target a node version for infusion
2017-01-09T15:47:13 <Justin_o> this came up on https://github.com/Jasig/resource-server/pull/48#issuecomment-269360164
2017-01-09T15:49:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think Christian Murphy has it correct
2017-01-09T15:50:45 <Bosmon> We are backstopped by whatever version of ecmascript is supported by IE11
2017-01-09T15:51:54 <Bosmon> Which as far as I can see is ES5
2017-01-09T15:57:45 <mrtyler> see, no problem, that meeting only consumed 38% of my battery :p
2017-01-09T16:06:21 <alanharn_> mrtyler: Vidyo eats batteries alive
2017-01-09T16:07:23 <mrtyler> like any VC software i guess
2017-01-09T16:07:32 <mrtyler> hangouts always makes my fan go crazy
2017-01-09T16:08:10 <colinclark> mrtyler: Vidyo is brutal for both batteries and bandwidth
2017-01-09T16:08:17 <colinclark> but fortunately it has pretty good settings for reducing both
2017-01-09T16:08:25 <colinclark> at the cost of slideshow-esque video
2017-01-09T16:09:29 <mrtyler> like an 80s music video. amatas\'s IG filters would fit right in
2017-01-09T16:09:30 <gtirloni> another alternative is to join these calls through webrtc (by following the room\'s URL on a modern browser it should work fine). most of my problems with vidyo are related to the vidyodesktop client on linux (i think on win/osx it\'s less aggressive with cpu/mem)
2017-01-09T16:09:52 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i was in-browser for that meeting actually
2017-01-09T16:10:04 <mrtyler> i expected the url to launch the vidyo app but it didn\'t
2017-01-09T16:10:11 <mrtyler> (that\'s how Zoom works, e.g.)
2017-01-09T16:10:19 <amatas> I\'ve a new video effect every time I use vidyo :)
2017-01-09T16:10:50 <mrtyler> /sanick amatas Alfredo_Headroom
2017-01-09T16:11:24 <gtirloni> iirc, if you have vidyodesktop running at the time you try to join the conference.. the website\'s JS will try to connect locally to it (vidyodesktop opens a port on 127.0.0.1 for that)... and will launch it
2017-01-09T16:11:55 <gtirloni> if vidyo is not running, there is a complicated flow where it checks your OS/browser.. if it supports Webrtc, then webrtc it is.. otherwise it\'d prompt you to install a native browser extension (vidyoweb)
2017-01-09T16:12:22 * danayo joined the channel
2017-01-09T16:12:49 <mrtyler> gtirloni: interesting. that seems to be what the page at https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/download.html?lang=en is telling me
2017-01-09T16:13:05 <mrtyler> i also really, really like how vidyo installs itself into /Applications not one but TWO subfolders deep
2017-01-09T16:14:08 <amatas> gtirloni, mrtyler sometimes I use appear.in to chat with familiy/friends. It alsow uses webrtc, for meetings with few people works fine.
2017-01-09T16:14:41 <mrtyler> amatas: do you like it more than hangouts? that\'s my default VC setup
2017-01-09T16:15:22 <mrtyler> aw their footer graphic is so cute
2017-01-09T16:19:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, i\'ve replied to them about the support for infusion.
2017-01-09T16:21:10 <Justin_o> Also, some might find this interesting http://xkcd.com/1782/
2017-01-09T16:23:08 * michelled1 joined the channel
2017-01-09T16:24:35 <amatas> mrtyler, I think that hangouts became very laggy when they droped the jabber support.
2017-01-09T16:24:57 <mrtyler> ...hangouts had jabber support?
2017-01-09T16:25:08 <mrtyler> for chat or does jabber protocol handle voice/video too?
2017-01-09T16:25:19 <amatas> for chat and file transfer
2017-01-09T16:25:39 <amatas> that was in 2008 or so
2017-01-09T16:25:58 <mrtyler> oh wow. i didn\'t use hangouts until 2012 or so
2017-01-09T16:26:10 <mrtyler> prev company used skype
2017-01-09T16:26:28 <mrtyler> and... gotomeeting maybe? not a lot of teleconf there
2017-01-09T16:27:47 <amatas> now I also use Telegram
2017-01-09T16:28:46 <amatas> multiplatform, multimedia support, and of course animated gifs
2017-01-09T16:30:28 <mrtyler> amatas: keeping your eye on what\'s important. i respect that
2017-01-09T16:31:21 <mrtyler> gtirloni: thanks for creating me a vidyo account. i\'d like to change the password but i guess i need a VidyoPortal to log in?
2017-01-09T16:31:36 <mrtyler> i tried the "key" value from the url for this morning\'s meeting but vidyo says "server is unreachable"
2017-01-09T16:31:46 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-01-09T16:32:03 <gtirloni> mrtyler, in vidyodesktop,do you see a "forgot password" in the login screen (you may have to logout first)
2017-01-09T16:32:09 <mrtyler> i do
2017-01-09T16:32:35 <gtirloni> that should work for changing the password. it\'s not the most intuitive UX
2017-01-09T16:32:58 <mrtyler> ok i\'ll try it but then i still don\'t know what to put in VidyoPortal, which is required for logging in
2017-01-09T16:33:23 <gtirloni> https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca
2017-01-09T16:33:58 <mrtyler> gtirloni: right i did that, it\'s how i downloaded the softwware
2017-01-09T16:33:58 <gtirloni> that\'s the portal URL
2017-01-09T16:34:11 <mrtyler> but it tells me to run the software (which i did), which then prompts me for a portal, which i don\'t know
2017-01-09T16:34:15 <mrtyler> (along with my l/p, which i do know)
2017-01-09T16:34:17 <gtirloni> yeah, that goes into vidyodesktop too, it\'s the portal\'s address too
2017-01-09T16:34:25 <mrtyler> ohhhh
2017-01-09T16:34:51 <mrtyler> aha, great
2017-01-09T16:34:55 <mrtyler> gtirloni++ arigatou
2017-01-09T16:35:22 <gtirloni> np
2017-01-09T16:45:18 <mrtyler> avtar: i no longer remember why we were talking about it but that hipaa whitepaper from amazon is surprisingly decent
2017-01-09T16:45:34 <mrtyler> looks like the key things are to use a VPC with Dedicated Instances
2017-01-09T16:45:47 <mrtyler> (in addition to normal hipaa best practices stuff like SSL/TLS everywhere)
2017-01-09T16:46:18 <mrtyler> presumably we want vpc/di anyway for management/performance reasons, so basically that part is a no-op
2017-01-09T16:46:30 <mrtyler> is my initial impression
