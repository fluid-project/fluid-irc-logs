b'2017-09-08T14:45:51 <Bosmon> SInce I am just making a couple more merges
2017-09-08T14:45:55 <jhernandez> and thanks for the quick review/merge
2017-09-08T14:45:57 <jhernandez> oh
2017-09-08T14:46:01 <jhernandez> which ones?
2017-09-08T14:46:07 <Bosmon> klown\'s fixes
2017-09-08T14:46:14 * clown wakes up.  huh?
2017-09-08T14:46:23 <Bosmon> They won\'t affect your work much, but you may as well be up to date
2017-09-08T14:46:28 <clown> oh, pull 140?
2017-09-08T14:46:35 <jhernandez> okay
2017-09-08T14:46:46 <clown> Bosmon, they\'ll make the tests run faster
2017-09-08T14:46:55 <Bosmon> Yes
2017-09-08T14:46:59 <Bosmon> They will
2017-09-08T14:47:01 <jhernandez> YES!
2017-09-08T14:47:24 <clown> on my VM, worst case (looking through all the processes) is aroun 90msec
2017-09-08T14:47:28 <clown> *around
2017-09-08T14:51:33 <stegru> i read that as "90 seconds"
2017-09-08T14:51:52 <stegru> it would be quicker to download pslist and run it ;)
2017-09-08T14:53:20 <clown> indeed, stegru

2017-09-08T15:18:48 <michelled> Bosmon: I realize you are super swamped, but when you get a chance, perhaps you have some guidance for me. In this branch, I\'ve fixed it so that the promise will only be resolved once: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2092-pair/src/app.js  Both sets of Integration tests run now, however, they run using the same config - the \'dev\' config. Despite specifying the \'app\' config here: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GP

2017-09-08T15:20:59 <Bosmon> I\'ll just look it over again...
2017-09-08T15:21:06 <michelled> thank you!
2017-09-08T15:25:54 <Bosmon> michelled - so do both of the test runs log "app.dev tests" to the console, when this line is hit? : https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2092-pair/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L55
2017-09-08T15:26:07 <michelled> yes
2017-09-08T15:28:35 <Bosmon> michelled - ok, I suggest you trace into the function at this point to see if the data has already become corrupted by the time it has been reached: https://github.com/michelled/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2092-pair/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L68

2017-09-08T10:10:14 <georgitodorov> Bosmon - Hi, Antranig! I am currently playing around with the GPII-2556 branch. I am also reviewing the steps listed in this Google Doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c7QWlh-CFmkdERja7m0VRby50rySAkAP9eLGNiSlZGE/edit?ts=599adb95#heading=h.2g83k9312skg) about which settings the PCP should display.
2017-09-08T10:11:33 <georgitodorov> According to the Google doc, there should be an `applications` property under preferences.contexts[activeContextName] but it seems that this is not the case for any of the accounts that we are currently testing with.
2017-09-08T10:12:21 <georgitodorov> However, I see that there is an `applications` property under `matchMakerOutput.inferredConfiguration[activeContextName]`. Shall we use the values there?

2017-09-08T12:35:41 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov - it\'s a really good question
2017-09-08T12:36:21 <Bosmon> Actually the API document is not quite right in this regard - the first point is that you should expect to find in the "preferences" section exactly the format that you see in a user\'s preference set
2017-09-08T12:36:38 <Bosmon> This is indeed capable of encoding some application-specific preferences, but in fact they look like this:
2017-09-08T12:36:56 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/andrei.json
2017-09-08T12:39:05 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel
2017-09-08T12:39:32 <Bosmon> The "applications" you see under matchMakerOutput have a slightly different purpose - these allow you to account for which applications a particular preference has actually been allocated to by the matchmaker
2017-09-08T12:40:05 <Bosmon> Naturally for an application-specific preference, this will be the same application - but for a preference expressed as a "common term" this will vary depending on the system configuration
2017-09-08T12:41:04 <Bosmon> The PCP will read and write data expressed as these preference documents, so you should become familiar with this structure and target your design at it
2017-09-08T12:41:56 <Bosmon> All the other structures you see in the PCP payload are i) for your UI bookkeeping - for example the UI designs require you to indicate which application a currently active preference is a setting for, and ii) to allow you access to schematic information
2017-09-08T12:42:09 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-09-08T12:50:45 <georgitodorov> Bosmon - So there won\'t be an `applications` property under preferences.contexts[activeContextName]? Is this correct? If so, shall we consult both `commonTermsMetadata` and `solutionRegistryEntries` when looking up schematic information about each setting?
2017-09-08T12:51:46 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, the choice of which block to consult depends on how the preference was expressed in the user\'s preference set
2017-09-08T12:52:04 <Bosmon> For a preference like http://registry.gpii.net/common/fontSize you will consult commonTermsMetadata
2017-09-08T12:52:35 <Bosmon> Whereas for a preference like http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.texthelp.readWriteGold you will consult solutionsRegistryEntries
2017-09-08T12:54:07 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Is there a way to determine which "map" to consult? Or, should we first try to look it up in `commonTermsMetadata` and if there is nothing for that setting there, check `solutionRegistryEntries`?
2017-09-08T12:54:09 <Bosmon> You will see that necessarily there will have to be some changes in our preferences document format so that we can support all of the use cases of the PCP - for the coming deployment I think you should plan to be editing primarily common terms
2017-09-08T12:54:27 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - you call based on the first section of the rather fake "URL" in those preferences
2017-09-08T12:54:38 <Bosmon> If it is /common, you will look in common terms
2017-09-08T12:54:48 <Bosmon> but /application in the solutions registry
2017-09-08T12:57:21 <Bosmon> There will also be some metadata in the preferences set to describe some of its use in the PCP - for example, whether a particular preference will be "sticky" or not
2017-09-08T12:57:51 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I see, this was very helpful. Thank you!
2017-09-08T12:58:02 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - this will be in a format which appears in this section: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Preference_Conditions_Format#Simplified_Form_With_Implicit_Operator
2017-09-08T12:58:22 <Bosmon> However, there are currently no examples of such preference sets in the system, or code which parses them
2017-09-08T12:58:29 <Bosmon> But we will shortly be producing this
2017-09-08T12:59:11 <Bosmon> Once I get all the tests to pass in my PCP API branch, our next task with kasparnet and cindyli will be to produce all the infrastructure which will allow you to save preferences

2017-09-08T14:00:27 <Bosmon> stegru - which build was your previous test failure on windows?
2017-09-08T14:00:40 <Bosmon> 258?
2017-09-08T14:01:03 <Bosmon> gtirloni - would it be possible to get the gpii-bot test failure message to be a bit more informative?
2017-09-08T14:01:14 <stegru> 260
2017-09-08T14:01:16 <Bosmon> If the failure is for anything other than the most recent build, it seems hard to track back which one it was
2017-09-08T14:01:20 <stegru> no, not 260
2017-09-08T14:01:34 <Bosmon> gtirloni - at present it just says "CI job failed. Please visit http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/ci/ for more details."
2017-09-08T14:02:05 <gtirloni> Bosmon: let me check that. I tried to make the status a bit more information (the one at the bottom of the PRs) but hit a bug in jenkins... let\'s see if the comment is easier to change
2017-09-08T14:02:12 <gtirloni> *informative
2017-09-08T14:02:21 <Bosmon> gtirloni - the status at the bottom is ok
2017-09-08T14:02:23 <Bosmon> Because it has the link
2017-09-08T14:02:26 <stegru> yes 258 - it failed at delete-windows-vm
2017-09-08T14:02:30 <Bosmon> But we need to be able to track things back after the fact
2017-09-08T14:02:33 <stegru> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-tests/258/
2017-09-08T14:02:42 <gtirloni> got it
2017-09-08T14:02:43 <Bosmon> So for example in this situation I know that stegru had a failed build on his branch
2017-09-08T14:02:51 <Bosmon> But it\'s no longer easy to tell which build it was
2017-09-08T14:03:21 <Bosmon> If the comment from gpii-bot just mentions the build number, that would be a great help
2017-09-08T14:03:28 <gtirloni> agreed
2017-09-08T14:03:30 <Bosmon> But an exact link would be even better
2017-09-08T14:03:49 <Bosmon> Cheers!
2017-09-08T14:04:15 <gtirloni> stegru: your build failed because it reached the 25min limit, it was unfortunate that happened during the VM destroy task but the real issue is the create VM task which took 21min
2017-09-08T14:04:38 <stegru> ok
2017-09-08T14:04:50 <gtirloni> we increased the time limit for gpii-app, if this wasn\'t an anomaly, we can do the same for gpii/windows
2017-09-08T14:05:25 <stegru> it\'s building the installer that takes most of the time, i noticed
2017-09-08T14:06:20 <stegru> no, i\'m wrong.. but it felt like it did
