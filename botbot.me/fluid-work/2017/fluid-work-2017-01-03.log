2017-01-03T15:37:28 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2017-01-03T15:52:56 <stegru> hi cindyli.. sorry, I'm not Bosmon, but how do I access your vidyo thing? is there a client, or web-based thing?
2017-01-03T15:53:44 <cindyli> glad to hear from your too, stegru, let me see if i can find some docs about vidyo
2017-01-03T15:54:49 <stegru> oh, it says the organiser will provide a link
2017-01-03T15:56:22 <cindyli> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Vidyo+video+conferencing, it provides a link to the fluid_standup vidyo room. i wonder how i can provide a link to my vidyo room, amatas, do you have an idea?
