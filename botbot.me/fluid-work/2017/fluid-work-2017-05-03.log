2017-05-03T13:49:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking at the resizeTo function https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resizeTo
2017-05-03T13:49:59 <Justin_o> but seems it only works when there is only one tab in the window and when the window was created with window.open
2017-05-03T13:50:06 <Justin_o> so probably won\'t work for the test
2017-05-03T13:50:27 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-05-03T13:50:47 <cindyli> oh, no
2017-05-03T13:51:05 <Justin_o> I guess i\'ll have to look at using an iframe
2017-05-03T13:51:48 <cindyli> good luck

2017-05-03T14:54:52 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - what feature are you implementing?
2017-05-03T14:54:55 * kavya joined the channel
2017-05-03T14:55:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello
2017-05-03T14:56:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m providing interim functionality for the arrows that appear in the mobile ( small screen ) view of UIO http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/
2017-05-03T14:56:39 <Justin_o> currently they aren\'t interactive, but i have some code to make them clickable
2017-05-03T14:56:52 <Justin_o> which will cause it to scroll to the adjacent panel
2017-05-03T14:56:52 <Bosmon> What do the wireframes look like?
2017-05-03T14:58:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry, looking for them again
2017-05-03T14:58:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=137658573
2017-05-03T14:59:19 <Bosmon> Cool
2017-05-03T14:59:29 <Bosmon> And what has the resizing requirement turned out to be?
2017-05-03T14:59:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the breadcrumbs and "?" haven\'t been implemented yet, also the final designs for the arrows might change
2017-05-03T14:59:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s just for the test, because this functionality is only available in small screen sizes
2017-05-03T15:00:07 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-05-03T15:00:16 <Justin_o> it can\'t be tested if the browser is 640px or wider
2017-05-03T15:00:34 <Bosmon> aha
2017-05-03T15:00:37 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2017-05-03T15:00:38 <Bosmon> To make the media queries work?
2017-05-03T15:00:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, exactly
2017-05-03T15:00:58 <Justin_o> in the larger views those arrows are removed
2017-05-03T15:02:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m trying to create a test now where the separatedPanel prefs editor is instantiated into an iframe, and we can control the size of the iframe
2017-05-03T15:02:55 * avtar has quit
2017-05-03T15:04:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2017-05-03T15:05:03 <Bosmon> Designs look great, looking foward to this great new incarnation of UIO!
2017-05-03T15:05:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. most of it is up already on the build site

2017-05-03T15:38:26 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - does anyone recall, if I want to invite someone to the web-RTC incarnation of a Vidyo meeting, how I find the URL?
2017-05-03T15:38:44 <Bosmon> Or indeed.... what the name of the room is in which we have community meetings, since I seem to have managed to delete it whilst trying to find its URL : p
