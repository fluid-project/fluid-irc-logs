2017-05-02T18:57:54 <colinclark> Bosmon, Bosmon7: I\'m working on a fairly simple Node.js server, which needs to do two things: 1. serve up static files (mostly HTML) and 2. Respond to OSC messages sent over Web Sockets and proxy them to UDP sockets (using osc.js)...
2017-05-02T18:58:02 <colinclark> Do you recommend that I use Kettle or gpii-express for this?

2017-05-02T19:03:16 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-05-02T19:05:10 <Bosmon7> colinclark - kettle, since gpii-express has no WebSockets support
2017-05-02T19:05:34 <colinclark> ok
2017-05-02T19:05:35 <colinclark> cool
2017-05-02T19:05:37 <colinclark> thank you
2017-05-02T19:05:53 <Bosmon7> You\'ll be pleased to find a new release was rolled last night : P
2017-05-02T19:05:54 <colinclark> It\'s been years since I\'ve written a Kettle app from scratch
2017-05-02T19:06:00 <colinclark> that\'s awesome

2017-05-02T19:55:05 <Bosmon7> colinclark - do you mean an "old old kettle" app?
2017-05-02T19:55:12 <Bosmon7> Or an "old old old kettle" app? : P
2017-05-02T19:55:14 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-05-02T19:55:30 <colinclark> I believe it was a "early GPII era" Kettle app
2017-05-02T19:55:40 <colinclark> this is like Apple\'s naming for macbooks :P
2017-05-02T19:55:44 <colinclark> totally perplexing
2017-05-02T19:56:09 <colinclark> Or, to cast it in cat terms, an "Early Hugo era" Kettle app
2017-05-02T19:56:24 <colinclark> since it was a cat cam app running on a Raspberry Pi

2017-05-02T20:12:03 <cindyli> gtirloni: i just issued and merged a pull request for achecker to fix a security issue. i wonder if you could re-deploy achecker.ca to include that fix
2017-05-02T20:13:34 <gtirloni> cindyli: sure! is it okay to have it auto-deploy from \'master\' from now on too?
2017-05-02T20:13:48 <Bosmon7> colinclark - cool
2017-05-02T20:13:53 <Bosmon7> I guess that is merely "old kettle" :)
2017-05-02T20:13:57 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-05-02T20:14:11 <cindyli> yes, i believe so. can you double check the current achecker.ca is deployed from the master, gtirloni
2017-05-02T20:14:52 <gtirloni> cindyli: yes, it\'s master from github.com/inclusive-design/AChecker.git
2017-05-02T20:14:57 <cindyli> cool
2017-05-02T20:15:11 <cindyli> that\'s where my pull goes in
2017-05-02T20:15:43 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-05-02T20:16:43 <gtirloni> cindyli: ok! the fix is in..  i\'ll get the CI rolling and let you know too.
