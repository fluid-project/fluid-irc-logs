2017-10-12T15:38:29 <javjarfer> hi everyone! Anybody knows if fluid provides a convenience function to check if a javascript object is defined in a arbitrary nested level?

2017-10-12T16:09:31 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-10-12T16:10:34 <colinclark> javjarfer: Can you give an example of what you need?
2017-10-12T16:14:28 <javjarfer> colinclark, yes, just wanted to know if there is a helper function to check that \'obj.objProp1.objProp2...\' exists, I have write my own, but maybe fluid has one
2017-10-12T16:15:15 <colinclark> javjarfer: This will do what you want, I believe: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-get-model-path-
2017-10-12T16:15:23 <colinclark> So,
2017-10-12T16:15:40 <colinclark> fluid.get(obj, "objProp1.objProp2")
2017-10-12T16:15:44 <colinclark> and then you can simply test the return value
2017-10-12T16:16:36 <javjarfer> colinclark, ooh okay, thanks you!

2017-10-12T17:47:16 <javjarfer> hi stegru! Do you have any more details about that way of changing the whole control panel settings?
2017-10-12T17:47:38 <javjarfer> would be really nice to have that, do you think I should stop the individual research?
2017-10-12T17:47:49 <javjarfer> looks promising?
