2017-01-27T15:38:15 <cindyli> simonjb: can we do a short call to continue on yesterday\'s topics when you have time?
2017-01-27T15:41:22 <simonjb> cindyli: for sure, after standup?
2017-01-27T15:41:41 <cindyli> sure, simonjb
2017-01-27T15:41:52 <cindyli> thanks
2017-01-27T15:44:05 <Bosmon> What are you looking at today, cindyli, simonjb
2017-01-27T15:44:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: how to secure the access to client id/secret on windows machines
2017-01-27T15:44:44 <Bosmon> cool

2017-01-27T15:52:23 <amatas> gtirloni, jfyi I\'ve updated the official package for CentOS of Docker from 1.10 to 1.12 and I had to remove all the containers and its images, and then pull/build again and start them up.
2017-01-27T16:23:57 <gtirloni> ugh :(
2017-01-27T16:24:49 * michelled joined the channel
2017-01-27T16:24:54 <gtirloni> amatas: did you use an updated package that\'s in still or something?
2017-01-27T16:25:38 <amatas> I just used "yum update"
2017-01-27T16:26:26 <gtirloni> ah so they really went forward with that update.. interesting
2017-01-27T16:29:04 <gtirloni> that seems like a big no-go for updating i-0026 and i-0033.. thanks for the heads up
2017-01-27T16:29:05 <amatas> yup, seems that they just push the update in a way ... http://imgur.com/R7tEQPA
2017-01-27T16:29:47 <amatas> yes, please, all in i-0026 can be recreated with ansible, but I\'d like to test the upgrade in a safe place before.
2017-01-27T16:30:07 <gtirloni> that gif seems consistent with all docker upgrades i\'ve ever seen
2017-01-27T16:30:17 <amatas> haha
2017-01-27T16:30:30 <amatas> also this seems related to the SElinux issues: http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/75011.html
2017-01-27T16:31:15 <amatas> I removed the docker-selinux in favor of container-selinux and it worked almost fine
2017-01-27T16:31:45 <gtirloni> yeah, what\'s weird is that all of this should be done automatically by the upgrade... fedora/rhel has changed package names countless time and we never had to remove/reinstall... that one was weird
2017-01-27T16:44:54 <amatas> gtirloni, how do you know which is the latest iso of windows 10? I updated upstream and I though that they were using the latest.
2017-01-27T16:45:51 <amatas> anyway I\'ll try to build with the previous iso image and see if the WU downloads less updates.

2017-01-27T16:50:37 <gtirloni> i always go by that number in front of it and the windows release (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions)
2017-01-27T17:01:29 <amatas> ok, changed
