b'2017-08-11T15:18:26 <stegru> yes!
2017-08-11T15:19:45 <colinclark> kids/cats/dogs/friends/synthesizers
2017-08-11T15:22:00 <javjarfer_> synthesizers are always important in the equation xD
2017-08-11T15:22:12 <javjarfer_> denotative synthesizers
2017-08-11T15:23:43 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-08-11T15:24:31 <colinclark> cindyli: You were incredible at explaining all the subtle details of our security architecture to the UX!!!
2017-08-11T15:24:34 <colinclark> amazing work
2017-08-11T15:24:57 <cindyli> yay! thanks, colin. easier than i thought
2017-08-11T15:25:05 <colinclark> So it sounds like "Option 3" of your workflows here is the one they like best https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Workflows_to_Request_and_Manage_Client_Credentials#Option_3:_Request_Client_Credential_within_GPII_App_while_Login_at_GPII_website
2017-08-11T15:25:33 <colinclark> and also that we should assume that all computers that the GPII is installed on will be connected to the internet, or we bail with an error message?
2017-08-11T15:25:42 <cindyli> yes
2017-08-11T15:25:50 <colinclark> ok, that\'s really great
2017-08-11T15:26:05 <colinclark> I guess the only scenario we still need to figure out is a lab administrator who doesn\'t want to install on each computer
2017-08-11T15:26:20 <colinclark> no one who manages many machines will ever do these things manually, one at at time
2017-08-11T15:26:41 <colinclark> my friend Alex, who maintains computer labs at Sheridan College, says that the bane of his existence is manual installation
2017-08-11T15:26:52 <cindyli> lol
2017-08-11T15:27:01 <colinclark> so somehow we will also need to support the situation where an administrator is just pushing an MSI to 100 machines
2017-08-11T15:27:15 <colinclark> and they\'ll need to bulk load client credentials onto them
2017-08-11T15:27:26 <stegru> why don\'t you ask him of examples of good software?
2017-08-11T15:27:41 <colinclark> I definitely will
2017-08-11T15:27:48 <colinclark> in fact maybe I\'ll get him to speak to us at some p oint
2017-08-11T15:27:50 <stegru> we\'re not the first to do this
2017-08-11T15:27:56 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2017-08-11T15:27:57 <cindyli> you mean to figure out a way to make 100 machines to have 100 different client credentials, colinclark
2017-08-11T15:28:03 <colinclark> often Alex will build his own custom packages that run a script to pull a code from a CSV file or whatever
2017-08-11T15:28:06 <colinclark> yes, exactly, cindyli
2017-08-11T15:28:16 <colinclark> the one issue is that Alex administers Mac labs
2017-08-11T15:28:29 <colinclark> but I\'m hoping he might bring one of his Windows colleagues to talk to us, too
2017-08-11T15:28:46 <cindyli> ok, yes, we need to think about that if it\'s an use case
2017-08-11T15:29:01 <colinclark> He says the worst apps in the world the administer, these days, is the Adobe Creative Cloud software
2017-08-11T15:29:19 <colinclark> It\'ll definitely be a use case by the time we get into schools
2017-08-11T15:30:14 <cindyli> what\'s special with the Adobe Creative Cloud software
2017-08-11T15:30:35 <colinclark> Well, they manage their own authentication :)
2017-08-11T15:30:38 <colinclark> just like us :P
2017-08-11T15:30:47 <cindyli> haha
2017-08-11T15:30:47 <stegru> there isn\'t much of an alternative
2017-08-11T15:30:59 <colinclark> as far as I know, there\'s no way to distribute a set of CC credentials to all machines in a lab
2017-08-11T15:31:09 <colinclark> even though they are all authorized by the College
2017-08-11T15:31:16 <colinclark> stegru: Yup, exactly
2017-08-11T15:31:27 <colinclark> Sheridan is one of the biggest graphic arts colleges in Canada
2017-08-11T15:31:34 <colinclark> trains tons of illustrators and 3D animators for industry
2017-08-11T15:31:44 <colinclark> it\'s not like they\'re going to teach Gimp and Blender :P
2017-08-11T15:32:51 <colinclark> cindyli: I can imagine we might have a web interface in which someone can, with the appropriate credentials, download keys in bulk
2017-08-11T15:32:58 <colinclark> perhaps in a numbered CSV file or something along those lines
2017-08-11T15:33:00 <stegru> bring out the gimp!
2017-08-11T15:33:10 <colinclark> :) :)
2017-08-11T15:35:04 <stegru> my college had "license servers", locally, which allowed them to use floating licences (software installed on 1000 machines, but only licensed for 100)
2017-08-11T15:35:21 <stegru> perhaps something like that could be used
2017-08-11T15:35:47 <stegru> not sure how, just a random thought. sorry
2017-08-11T15:35:54 <colinclark> yes, that\'s a good idea
2017-08-11T15:36:24 <colinclark> and that\'s exactly what is frustrating about Adobe CC
2017-08-11T15:36:28 <colinclark> is that all those options are cut off
2017-08-11T15:36:36 <colinclark> yeah, a centralized license server could be interesting
2017-08-11T15:36:55 <colinclark> It does seem that we really need to talk to some admins about what works and doesn\'t
2017-08-11T15:37:44 <stegru> yes, some might actually enjoy walking around the campus with a usb drive.. and you want to take that away from them
2017-08-11T15:37:51 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-08-11T15:41:08 <cindyli> ya, would be great to have the input from ppl at the front line
2017-08-11T16:10:26 <colinclark> cindyli: I just talked to Alex and he said he could do a session with us. I\'ll need to find a way to pay him an honorarium. And he\'s going to talk to his Windows colleague and see if they can join us as well.
2017-08-11T16:10:36 <colinclark> Is there a date that works particularly well?
2017-08-11T16:11:57 <cindyli> colinclark: are we doing via vidyo? also need to figure out attendees
2017-08-11T16:12:22 <colinclark> either by vidyo or in person + vidyo
2017-08-11T16:12:32 <colinclark> in terms of attendees, definitely you and stegru
2017-08-11T16:12:37 <colinclark> but others too
2017-08-11T16:12:42 <colinclark> perhaps someone from UX
2017-08-11T16:12:43 <cindyli> simon might be interested
2017-08-11T16:12:45 <colinclark> yes
2017-08-11T16:13:36 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-11T16:15:15 <cindyli> we can create a doodle once figuring out attendees. some people are away this week, i can check with simon next week
2017-08-11T16:15:43 <stegru> yes i\'d be interested, but don\'t worry about the time
2017-08-11T16:16:31 <cindyli> jhernandez_ works on installers, he might be interested too
2017-08-11T16:17:04 <stegru> oh, not him!
2017-08-11T16:18:22 <cindyli> ** jhernandez_ is offended ;)

2017-08-11T14:36:09 <stegru> colinclark: interesting report on windows S. I\'ve just installed it on a VM - I have some words on what the "S" is for
2017-08-11T14:38:24 <colinclark> hahaha, stegru
2017-08-11T14:38:34 <colinclark> So, how did you actually manage to install it?
2017-08-11T14:38:43 <colinclark> I was under the impression that we couldn\'t get Insiders builds for it
2017-08-11T14:38:46 <colinclark> but maybe I missed it?
2017-08-11T14:38:57 <stegru> oh.. i just got it from MSDN
2017-08-11T14:39:08 <colinclark> oh cool
2017-08-11T14:39:14 <colinclark> duh :)
2017-08-11T14:39:18 <colinclark> I should have thought to check there
2017-08-11T14:39:40 <stegru> but anyway, GPII couldn\'t be installed - as expected
2017-08-11T14:41:04 <colinclark> Yes
2017-08-11T14:41:39 <colinclark> We should be able to use Centennial to port our installer to an AppX package, right, stegru?
2017-08-11T14:41:49 <colinclark> I\'d be curious to hear what that\'s like
2017-08-11T14:41:54 <stegru> if you say so :)
2017-08-11T14:42:35 <colinclark> I think the company that makes Wix also has a converter
2017-08-11T14:42:38 <simonjb> We\'d still be running in a sandbox, I think
2017-08-11T14:42:52 <colinclark> but if I understand Centennial correctly, it basically "records" the output of an installer
2017-08-11T14:42:53 <colinclark> yes
2017-08-11T14:43:03 <colinclark> It appears that the sandbox is pretty liberal
2017-08-11T14:43:11 <colinclark> but we\'ve got those two essential constraints
2017-08-11T14:43:17 <colinclark> a "virtual" registry and file system
2017-08-11T14:43:27 <colinclark> but I wonder what the file system limitations actualy are
2017-08-11T14:43:35 <colinclark> presumably there\'s still ways to open and save user files
2017-08-11T14:43:49 <colinclark> so I wonder if there are clever ways we could continue to make our file-based settings handlers work?
2017-08-11T14:43:57 <colinclark> The Registry is clearly out
2017-08-11T14:44:11 <stegru> i\'m guessing it\'s similar to android.. you can do what you like to your own files, but you have to "ask" for the user\'s files (i\'m only guessing)
2017-08-11T14:44:29 <simonjb> yes, I think that saving user files was just recently added -- but I believe that the user has to use the GUI to set the location
2017-08-11T14:45:06 <stegru> for normal users, i think it\'s a good feature
2017-08-11T14:45:33 <stegru> not for us, or especially GPII
2017-08-11T14:47:16 <simonjb> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/files/index
2017-08-11T14:48:00 <colinclark> ok, interesting
2017-08-11T14:49:10 <simonjb> this is for UWP, and I\'m guessing Centennial wrapped applications have similar constraints but I don\'t know the details
2017-08-11T14:49:29 <javjarfer_> "Microsoft Edge is your default browser since it\xe2\x80\x99s more secure than Chrome or Firefox."
2017-08-11T14:49:59 <javjarfer_> *very slow applause*
2017-08-11T14:50:37 <colinclark> yeah, pretty lame justification
2017-08-11T14:50:43 <colinclark> though I have a weird soft spot for Edge
2017-08-11T14:50:46 <colinclark> it\'s cool
2017-08-11T14:50:46 <stegru> heh
2017-08-11T14:50:54 <stegru> oh dear
2017-08-11T14:51:10 <colinclark> stegru: You heard from Sandra that you are to go out and buy yourself a shiny new Surface Laptop, right?
2017-08-11T14:51:28 <stegru> yes
2017-08-11T14:51:33 <colinclark> we\'re all jealous
2017-08-11T14:52:09 <stegru> i\'m not keen on it
2017-08-11T14:52:19 <colinclark> on S?
2017-08-11T14:52:24 <colinclark> or on Surface Laptops?
2017-08-11T14:52:35 <stegru> windows :)
2017-08-11T14:52:37 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-08-11T14:52:48 <colinclark> My impression is that no one will be keen on Windows S
2017-08-11T14:52:59 <colinclark> I think it is going to be a significant flop
2017-08-11T14:53:05 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-08-11T14:53:11 <stegru> for the price, especially
2017-08-11T14:53:13 <colinclark> everyone who buys an S device will immediately take advantage of the free upgrade to Pro
2017-08-11T14:53:32 <colinclark> most importantly, I don\'t think anyone has any incentive to distribute their applications in the Store
2017-08-11T14:53:34 <stegru> well, as soon as you click on an .exe, it presents a link to the store
2017-08-11T14:53:39 <colinclark> fascinating
2017-08-11T14:53:40 <colinclark> and lose 30% of their revenue
2017-08-11T14:53:51 <stegru> well, they said that about apple and google stores
2017-08-11T14:54:00 <colinclark> yeah
2017-08-11T14:54:12 <colinclark> but there are millions of iOS devies in peoples\' hands
2017-08-11T14:54:29 <colinclark> the iPhone had sold a million units before they even introduced the App Store
2017-08-11T14:54:30 <stegru> i used to sell my own software, and about 10% went to payment processors, and a lot on google ads
2017-08-11T14:54:33 <colinclark> so there was a huge incentive
2017-08-11T14:54:37 <stegru> true
2017-08-11T14:54:39 <colinclark> interesting
2017-08-11T14:54:58 <colinclark> you sold the software from your website?
2017-08-11T14:55:10 <stegru> you do get a lot from your 30%
2017-08-11T14:55:14 <stegru> yes
2017-08-11T14:55:17 <colinclark> that\'s a pretty good point
2017-08-11T14:55:29 <colinclark> because you also had the cost of maintaining your download servers, etc.
2017-08-11T14:55:37 <stegru> yes
2017-08-11T14:55:46 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s very interesting
2017-08-11T14:56:08 <simonjb> and having a centralised update mechanism has some value also compared with every application doing it themselves
2017-08-11T14:56:31 <colinclark> yes
2017-08-11T14:56:44 <stegru> yep
2017-08-11T14:56:44 <colinclark> that was what struck me about researching Windows 10 S...
2017-08-11T14:56:53 <colinclark> They\'ve sandboxed not for security but for portability
2017-08-11T14:57:05 <colinclark> to make it much easier to install, update, and remove an App
2017-08-11T14:57:19 <stegru> yes, and as an end-user i\'d like that
2017-08-11T14:57:23 <colinclark> Installation on all platforms is pretty awful
2017-08-11T14:58:01 <colinclark> The Mac is particularly dismal with either 1) these "disk images" where you have to drag an app into your Applications folder or 2) Installers with no guarantee of the ability to uninstall later
2017-08-11T14:58:13 <colinclark> At least on Windows, you can be pretty sure you can go into Add/Remove Programs
2017-08-11T14:58:33 <colinclark> but I guess MS wants to get rid of Registry bloat and stray files floating around, etc.
2017-08-11T14:58:36 <simonjb> and I think they are maybe wanting to address the issue that Windows machines get slower and messier with time and each application you install adds more and more stuff to the startup processes and other parts of the system
2017-08-11T14:58:53 <colinclark> apparently all dependencies are packaged up with the app, so they\'re super self-contained
2017-08-11T14:58:57 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2017-08-11T14:59:29 <stegru> it just makes things almost impossible for things like GPII that need to interact with the OS and other applications
2017-08-11T14:59:37 <colinclark> right
2017-08-11T15:00:13 <colinclark> it\'s clear we\'re going to have to introduce an API for pushing settings to third-party applications
2017-08-11T15:00:20 <colinclark> one that is idiomatic on each platform
2017-08-11T15:00:41 <colinclark> and which we produce a very nice SDK and give good support to AT vendors in implementing
2017-08-11T15:00:49 <stegru> my old site: https://web.archive.org/web/20120120013412/http://www.anylogoscreensaver.com/
2017-08-11T15:01:03 <colinclark> oooh
2017-08-11T15:01:18 <colinclark> nice site!
2017-08-11T15:01:35 <stegru> actually, installing windows s was quite accessible already (compared to usual).. it actually spoke to me, and looked like it accepted voice instruction
2017-08-11T15:02:14 <colinclark> fascinating
2017-08-11T15:02:23 <stegru> i might have spent more time on that site than the actual software.. that\'s why i think 30% is a reasonable
2017-08-11T15:02:27 <colinclark> this is different from an installation of ordinary Windows 10 Pro?
2017-08-11T15:02:40 <stegru> yes
2017-08-11T15:02:54 <colinclark> that\'s very interesting
2017-08-11T15:03:09 <colinclark> it was a really nice site
2017-08-11T15:03:22 <colinclark> when was this, stegru?
2017-08-11T15:03:52 <stegru> oh no.. at first it was the same, where you pick the language and drive.. but on the initial configuration cortana helped
2017-08-11T15:04:04 <stegru> just this morning
2017-08-11T15:04:13 <stegru> oh, around 2006
2017-08-11T15:04:33 <javjarfer_> stegru, so, how was the overall experience of sending your own software? (nice site by the way :))
2017-08-11T15:04:45 <stegru> hard work, for little money
2017-08-11T15:04:56 <javjarfer_> very concise
2017-08-11T15:05:01 <stegru> i didn\'t do it for money
2017-08-11T15:05:29 <stegru> well, i did.. but that wasn\'t my motivator.
2017-08-11T15:06:07 <stegru> it\'s different to releasing OSS
2017-08-11T15:07:08 <javjarfer_> In which parts?
2017-08-11T15:07:31 <stegru> with open source, you just create it and upload it to github.. and that\'s it
2017-08-11T15:08:53 <stegru> but with commercial software, it needs to not create support requests, you need a site, that takes payments, SEO, ads, etc.
2017-08-11T15:09:38 <stegru> the main purpose of it was something to talk about at a job interview :)
2017-08-11T15:10:28 <javjarfer_> well, sure it was :) I think every software developer want to do that at least once, maybe even just for fun xD
2017-08-11T15:12:27 <stegru> yeh, i learned a lot from it - nothing technical, though
2017-08-11T15:16:30 <colinclark> ha
2017-08-11T15:16:54 <colinclark> I think one of the things I\'ve learned from having a few fairly widely-used open source libraries is that the same things apply
2017-08-11T15:17:01 <colinclark> except for payments and maybe ads
2017-08-11T15:17:04 <colinclark> but support is huge
2017-08-11T15:17:19 <colinclark> and there are things you need to do to keep your support costs low
2017-08-11T15:17:29 <colinclark> and in many ways it\'s even more acute, since this is often in our free tie
2017-08-11T15:17:30 <colinclark> time
2017-08-11T15:17:49 <colinclark> it potentiall eats away your time with kids/cats/dogs/friends
