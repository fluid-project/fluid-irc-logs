2017-05-29T14:44:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon, Bosmon7: when creating dynamic components  with a createOnEvent should we be able to use {arguments}.0 to set the value of a member?
2017-05-29T14:44:17 <Justin_o> in the members block
2017-05-29T14:47:42 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes, since we have the fix for https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5912
2017-05-29T14:48:17 <Bosmon7> Well, I thought we had the fix for it
2017-05-29T14:49:47 <Bosmon7> In any case, it should still work, since you are not doing this within model relay
2017-05-29T14:50:26 <Justin_o> in the chrome extension i\'m getting this error
2017-05-29T14:50:27 <Justin_o> Error: Assertion failure - check console for more details: Failed to resolve reference {arguments} - could not match context with name arguments from component { typeName: "fluid.modelComponent" gradeNames: [] id: 5v4blcg0-227} at path settings-5v4blcg0-11,domSettingsApplier,port component: [object Object]
2017-05-29T14:50:51 <Justin_o> but it works if i assign it to generic option
2017-05-29T14:51:13 <Bosmon7> Ash ok
2017-05-29T14:51:15 <Bosmon7> er Ah ok
2017-05-29T14:51:24 <Bosmon7> Please could you add this further detail to the JIRA?
2017-05-29T14:51:30 <Bosmon7> It looks like this is another that I had resolved only "in my mind"
2017-05-29T14:51:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/GPII-2426/extension/src/lib/domSettingsApplier.js#L56-L59
2017-05-29T14:52:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: does that code snippet look correct
2017-05-29T14:52:09 <Justin_o> perhaps in this case an option is fine anyways
2017-05-29T14:52:26 <Bosmon7> Yes, the snippet is fine
2017-05-29T14:53:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, did you need a JIRA for this, or do you have it covered with the one you sent me
2017-05-29T14:53:50 <Bosmon7> The same JIRA will be fine
2017-05-29T14:55:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay thanks, i added a comment there about this issue and left a link to this conversation
2017-05-29T14:59:19 <Bosmon7> Awesome, thanks so much Justin_o!
2017-05-29T14:59:36 <Justin_o> np
