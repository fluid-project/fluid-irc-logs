2017-06-29T19:35:15 <Jess_> i have copy-pasted from word to our wiki and it has gone well. what wiki are you using michelled ?
2017-06-29T19:35:20 <Justin_o> michelled: you can import word docs
2017-06-29T19:35:38 <michelled> the fluid wiki
2017-06-29T19:35:41 <Justin_o> michelled: there\'s an import word doc option in the fluid wiki, don\'t know about other wiki\'s though

2017-06-29T20:04:26 <clown> Justin_o:  do you know anything about colons in page titles, as in, how to allow that?
2017-06-29T20:05:17 <clown> it changed the colon to an underscore:  https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Privacy+Preferences+Design_+Risk+and+Security+Assessment

2017-06-29T13:20:14 <clown> Good morning.
2017-06-29T13:20:23 <Jess_> hello :)
2017-06-29T13:20:54 <clown> Pratik is looking for more information about Proseperity4All, and aksed me for pointes.  But\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-06-29T13:21:06 <clown> That\'s not a project I\'m overly familiar with.
2017-06-29T13:21:22 <Jess_> clown: hrm, i gave him lots of links yesterday\xe2\x80\xa6 i\xe2\x80\x99ll touch base with him again
2017-06-29T13:21:26 <clown> At the moment Pat and I am the only perople in the office.
2017-06-29T13:21:28 <Jess_> no worries!
2017-06-29T13:21:45 <clown> Yes, he says he has been reading the links, but is getting kind of lost.
2017-06-29T13:22:13 <clown> I gave him some background on GPII, but he doesn\'t think that\'s what he really interested in.
2017-06-29T13:22:50 <clown> Any how, I suggested he touch base with you.
2017-06-29T13:22:55 <Jess_> clown: ok, i\xe2\x80\x99ve pinged him. i gave him a bunch of links yesterday and he was going to get setup on IRC and such. i\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with him
2017-06-29T13:23:16 <clown> And, I volunteered to see if I could find something more "focussed" about P4A.
2017-06-29T13:23:22 <clown> Thanks.
2017-06-29T13:23:53 <clown> It\'s tough being a long weekend.  "No one" is around.
2017-06-29T13:29:52 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-06-29T13:37:01 <clown> fluid-everyone:  Pratik needs an IRC client for joing our chats here.  He\'s on Windows, which is not my area of expertise.  Any suggesstions?
2017-06-29T13:37:17 <Jess_> clown: there are suggestions on the wiki page...
2017-06-29T13:38:19 <clown> Thanks Jess_

2017-06-29T13:40:46 <stegru> you guys use clients for irc? wow
2017-06-29T13:41:29 <clown> well I do stegru.  are you psychic?

2017-06-29T14:21:37 <gtirloni_> I\'m experimenting with Fluid\'s expanders for the GPII config (env vars, etc...) and I was wondering if fluid has anything that would allow me to say "expand this thing if it exists, otherwise use this other value". does anyone know?
2017-06-29T14:21:44 <gtirloni_> fluid-everyone: ^^
2017-06-29T14:22:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: i guess your expander could take in a default, you\'d have to handle all the logic in your expander function though
2017-06-29T14:23:17 <michelled> Justin_o: aren\'t there conditional expanders?
2017-06-29T14:28:03 <cindyli> there\'s conditional transform: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html#conditional-transform-fluid-transforms-condition-
2017-06-29T14:29:41 <cindyli> gtirloni_: this condition transform is based on a boolean value. if what u\'d like to check is an undefined value or a file existence, you will need to first handle that logic by yourself before passing it to the conditional transform
2017-06-29T14:31:18 <gtirloni_> if i wanted that ability, would modifying this file so these resolvers accept an option (e.g. the default value to use if the lookup files) would be a good approach? https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleResolvers.js#L27-L29
2017-06-29T14:31:30 <gtirloni_> s/files/fails/
2017-06-29T14:31:33 * gtirloni_ is now known as gtirloni
2017-06-29T14:32:08 <gtirloni> or would introducing a different syntax to @expander be the way to go
2017-06-29T14:32:41 <gtirloni> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/ConfigsAndApplications.md#referring-to-external-data-via-resolvers
2017-06-29T14:32:50 <gtirloni> @expand, i meant.
2017-06-29T14:33:48 <cindyli> gtirloni: in the case the env var is not defined, kettle.resolvers.env() returns an undefined value. i think you can write another function wrapping around kettle.resolvers.env() to check its returned value then return what you want.
2017-06-29T14:34:40 <cindyli> the same strategy of ur first approach to let resolvers accept a default value
2017-06-29T14:35:20 <gtirloni> got it
2017-06-29T14:36:00 <gtirloni> final question, if i can get this to work reasonably well.. would it be better to submit a PR and discuss there or a JIRA? or both?
2017-06-29T14:39:04 <cindyli> gtirloni: I guess it depends when you\'d like to make this change? if you\'re thinking to modify kettle resolver functions, probably discuss in the channel with antranig first. if you\'re making use of resolver functions such as in universal repo, i think creating a JIRA and submit a PR is the way to go
2017-06-29T14:39:15 <cindyli> sorry, not "when", meant "where"
2017-06-29T14:40:03 <cindyli> what i suggested was the latter
2017-06-29T14:41:07 <gtirloni> i was thinking modifying the resolvers from kettle to accept an optional argument (or use a wrapper function, not sure what\'s the best approach) would be more generic, that way anyone using kettle can benefit
2017-06-29T14:41:32 <gtirloni> but yeah, i\'m mainly interested in using this for universal
2017-06-29T14:42:19 <cindyli> i see. since antranig is away for a few days, I think you probably should file a JIRA and submit a PR on kettle. it\'s not a big change anyway, gtirloni
2017-06-29T14:42:39 <gtirloni> i want to see how kettle deals with overlapping config files, what\'s the order.. i could have one config file providing a default value and a later merge another config that loads the env var, if it exists..
2017-06-29T14:42:48 <gtirloni> cool, will do

2017-06-29T15:27:38 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I can\'t seem to connect to vidyo today. Anyways, my standup update is that I have UIO showing up in the browser extension popup, but need to wire it up to the rest of the extension. So that it can modify the adaptations. I met with Kasper to talk about GPII and UIO+ integration today. It was pretty helpful, but there are a bunch of things to get done on that front.
2017-06-29T15:29:05 <cindyli> Justin_o: congrats on getting UIO showing in the popup
2017-06-29T15:29:13 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks :)
