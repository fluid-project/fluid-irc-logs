2017-06-13T20:22:37 <colinclark> Justin_o: Just saw this now
2017-06-13T20:22:42 <colinclark> what kind of GPII graphics are you thinking of?
2017-06-13T20:22:46 <colinclark> a logo, or something else?
2017-06-13T20:22:58 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, something like that, but maybe it isn't actually important..
2017-06-13T20:23:14 <colinclark> I believe michelled has the latest logo from Whitney
2017-06-13T20:23:20 <colinclark> a kind of odd cloud/gear hybrid
2017-06-13T20:23:20 <Justin_o> colinclark: but basically i'm injecting a button onto the page so that a user can toggle the navigation elements on/off when in simplified mode
2017-06-13T20:23:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: ah that could work
2017-06-13T20:23:47 <colinclark> that'll be really cool, Justin_o
2017-06-13T20:23:55 <colinclark> awesome that you're working on it
2017-06-13T20:24:07 <Justin_o> i was thinking of adding some gpii branding to the logo, but i'm not entirely sure a user would understand what it's for, but perhaps if they see something similar as to what's in the tray it might work
2017-06-13T20:24:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, its getting there.. would definitely be great to hear user feedback on how it works and etc. i imagine there'll be lots of ways we can improve it over time
2017-06-13T20:26:36 <colinclark> yup, totally
2017-06-13T20:33:36 <stegru> Bosmon7: that's because it's undocumented. It's in STARTUPINFO.lpReserved2

2017-06-13T16:16:35 <Bosmon7> I don\'t think that either of the two points are errors, but it looks like they should be rewritten for clarity
2017-06-13T16:16:44 <Bosmon7> Since anyone reading these docs ought to be able to understand them : P
2017-06-13T16:17:17 <Bosmon7> I can rewrite "be they" but I\'m not sure how I could reword "need not code for"
2017-06-13T16:17:34 <cindyli> what does it mean?
2017-06-13T16:17:43 <cindyli> i need a english tutor
2017-06-13T16:18:05 <cindyli> **an
2017-06-13T16:18:40 <cindyli> see, i do need a tutor ;)
2017-06-13T16:21:24 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-06-13T16:22:49 <Bosmon7> "be they" means "whether they are"
2017-06-13T16:23:03 <Bosmon7> I\'m not sure whether I can explain "need not code for" in other terms
2017-06-13T16:23:11 <Bosmon7> Would it be clearer to say "need not represent"?
2017-06-13T16:27:16 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-06-13T16:34:17 <Bosmon7> cindyli - or "need not encode"?
2017-06-13T16:34:58 <stegru> "does not need ..."
2017-06-13T16:37:02 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2017-06-13T16:39:09 <clown> Bosmon7, I just had a chat with cindyli about kettle configs and kettle applications and the wording she notes above: "\xe2\x80\xa6 need not \xe2\x80\xa6"
2017-06-13T16:39:45 <clown> Is it roughly equivalent to:  "kettle configs do not code for kettle apps only, but also any infusion application"?
2017-06-13T16:42:15 <Bosmon7> Yes
2017-06-13T16:42:24 <Bosmon7> I wasn\'t clear whether the obscure point was "need not" or "code for"
2017-06-13T16:47:12 <cindyli> Bosmon7: i think both
2017-06-13T16:48:00 <clown> "kettle configs do not supply configurration for kettle apps only, but also any infusion application" ?
2017-06-13T16:50:59 <Bosmon7> "supply configuration for" seems a bit roundabout, but I guess we don\'t have any standard vocabulary for the relationship between Infusion configuration and the resulting app
2017-06-13T16:51:19 <Bosmon7> colinclark - what does an Infusion IoC tree do? : P
2017-06-13T16:52:23 <clown> agreed Bosman7.  But I can\'t find a good synonym for "configure".  I was going to suggest "kettle configs do not configure kettle apps only, but also any infusion application", but the "configure" seemed circular.
2017-06-13T16:53:26 <cindyli> "kettle applications can be declared (represented) via freeform kettle configs, instead of writing actual code"
2017-06-13T16:55:17 <michelled> Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/513
2017-06-13T17:04:50 <michelled> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/122
2017-06-13T17:07:48 <Bosmon7> cindyli - but that isn\'t what the sentence is trying to say
2017-06-13T17:11:30 <cindyli> ok
2017-06-13T17:15:07 <Bosmon7> I mean, it is one of the things it is trying to say
2017-06-13T17:16:13 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2017-06-13T17:17:38 <Bosmon7> stegru - your solution to GPII-2399 is completely ingenious
2017-06-13T17:17:47 <Bosmon7> I\'m still working round trying to understand it : P
2017-06-13T17:18:55 <Bosmon7> Do you think you could flesh out the step 3 CreateProcessAsUser call a little?
2017-06-13T17:19:04 <Bosmon7> I\'m not quite sure which argument the pipe handle gets stuffed into
2017-06-13T17:19:13 * kasparnet has quit
2017-06-13T17:19:18 <Bosmon7> At least in terms of these docs - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682429(v=vs.85).aspx
2017-06-13T17:19:22 <Bosmon7> So it is just an int?
2017-06-13T17:19:47 <Justin_o> clown: i\'m not sure, maybe Pat might know... i actually haven\'t ever been inside the library at OCAD

2017-06-13T17:30:33 <clown> Justin_o:  thanks, but I\'ve already talked with Pat and James \xe2\x80\x94 all good for now.
2017-06-13T17:33:44 <Bosmon7> cindyli - does "represent" seem any better than "code"?
2017-06-13T17:35:03 <cindyli> Bosmon7, probably better, but i think it\'s still not very clear
2017-06-13T17:35:20 <cindyli> kettle configs need not represent kettle applications
2017-06-13T17:35:47 <cindyli> does it mean "kettle configs do not represent kettle applications"? i think this statement is wrong
2017-06-13T17:36:01 <Bosmon7> cindyli - do not represent *only* kettle applications
2017-06-13T17:36:38 <cindyli> ah ok, i think we should add "only"
2017-06-13T17:36:42 <Bosmon7> I\'ll certainly fix the "need not"
2017-06-13T17:36:53 <Bosmon7> cindyli - eliminating "need not" means adding "only"
2017-06-13T17:36:54 <cindyli> sounds great to me
2017-06-13T17:36:57 <Bosmon7> But I was looking at the other part
2017-06-13T17:37:00 <Bosmon7> Eliminating "code for"
2017-06-13T17:37:13 <Bosmon7> Does "represent" seem any better?
2017-06-13T17:37:23 <cindyli> yes
2017-06-13T17:37:32 <Bosmon7> ok cool
2017-06-13T17:38:39 <Bosmon7> fluid-everyone - celebrating the first public release of another major production from the-t-in-rtf - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpii-testem
2017-06-13T17:38:52 <Bosmon7> This will be invaluable across all of our projects

2017-06-13T17:39:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, the-t-in-rtf: does infusion need to be updated?
2017-06-13T17:40:13 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - infusion updated for what, or in what?
2017-06-13T17:40:25 <Justin_o> to use gpii-testem
