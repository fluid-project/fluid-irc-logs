2014-02-18T19:22:56 <michelled> colinclark: I just pinged you on an old pull request: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/145
2014-02-18T19:23:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - shall we have a chat some time this week?
2014-02-18T19:23:17 <Bosmon> Let me know what\'s a good time ...

2014-02-18T19:25:49 <Bosmon> Perhaps 4pm or 5pm EST?
2014-02-18T19:26:11 <simonjb> great, let\'s do 4pm

2014-02-18T20:05:59 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac: I was thinking for tomorrow\'s workshop, the task can be to implement the "About" and "Projects" pages using the CSS framework, Or we can convert an existing component demo to use the framework (thinking maybe the Climate change demo?).

2014-02-18T20:24:18 <michelled> anastasiac: do you know if the folder hierarchy on this JIRA was surfaced to list?
2014-02-18T20:24:19 <michelled> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5215
2014-02-18T20:26:09 <anastasiac> michelled, iirc, it was. I have a branch for that work started already
2014-02-18T20:26:26 <michelled> you have pull request, actaully
2014-02-18T20:26:35 <michelled> but it doesn\'t merge cleanly anymore
2014-02-18T20:26:41 <michelled> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/444
2014-02-18T20:26:44 <anastasiac> yeah, I suspected...
2014-02-18T20:26:47 <anastasiac> I\'ll update it this week
2014-02-18T20:35:08 <michelled> I can\'t find it on list - could you take a look or resurface it?

2014-02-18T21:42:40 <avtar> hi kasparnet
2014-02-18T21:42:48 <kasparnet> how are things in avtarland?
2014-02-18T21:43:18 <avtar> things are dandy
2014-02-18T21:43:31 <kasparnet> haha, that\'s good to hear
2014-02-18T21:43:34 <avtar> michelled mentioned that you\'re waiting on me
2014-02-18T21:44:14 <kasparnet> yeah - or I wanted to check if you could redeploy the prefs server from master
2014-02-18T21:44:35 <kasparnet> to see if that fixes the bug with not being able to upload preferences
2014-02-18T21:47:51 * clown joined the channel
2014-02-18T21:48:15 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2014-02-18T21:48:42 <kasparnet> I think "node_modules" folder of universal has to be deleted and "npm install" run again when doing so
2014-02-18T21:49:22 <kasparnet> colinclark: so getting back to our snapshotter
2014-02-18T21:49:52 <kasparnet> you said earlier: So I\'m confused by the relationship between the PMT, the preference sets we\'re creating, and the solutions entries for our SP3 applications
2014-02-18T21:49:59 <kasparnet> and this was in relation to snapshotter
2014-02-18T21:50:11 <kasparnet> so there are two scenarios:
2014-02-18T21:51:13 <kasparnet> for the RB MM: on platform A - PMT is used to create the initial set of preferences, the PCP is used to tweak them, and then the user moves to platform B
2014-02-18T21:52:13 <avtar> kasparnet: it hasn\'t gotten to that stage yet
2014-02-18T21:52:17 * anvk has quit
2014-02-18T21:52:47 <kasparnet> for the RB MM: On platform B, we record the settings being applied to the system by logging the output of a snapshot to a file, then the user/facilitator tweaks the system to optimal directly in the applications, and then does another snapshot-to-log
2014-02-18T21:53:00 <avtar> are you able to clone the universal repo?
2014-02-18T21:53:09 <avtar> nm
2014-02-18T21:54:02 <kasparnet> avtar: :)
2014-02-18T21:55:03 <kasparnet> for the ST MM: On platform A, the PMT is used to create initial prefs, then user tweaks settings in the actual applications, then snapshot is taken and saved as users NP set!
2014-02-18T21:55:55 <kasparnet> for the ST MM: then user moves to platform B, where a snapshot-to-log is done, he/she then tweaks settings and another snapshot-to-log is done

2014-02-18T22:15:56 <kasparnet> avtar: crap - it\'s not working
2014-02-18T22:16:22 <kasparnet> still getting {"isError":true,"message":"Cannot read property \'isError\' of undefined"} as response
2014-02-18T22:18:47 <kasparnet> avtar: how is it being deployed? something like: node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs/
2014-02-18T22:18:57 <kasparnet> (I\'m unable to reproduce locally)
2014-02-18T22:19:28 <avtar> kasparnet: NODE_ENV=production node /srv/nodejs/gpii_pref_server/node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js /srv/nodejs/gpii_pref_server/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs/
2014-02-18T22:19:53 <avtar> node --version
2014-02-18T22:19:54 <avtar> v0.10.24
2014-02-18T22:20:18 <kasparnet> ok - I\'m running v0.8.25
2014-02-18T22:20:24 <kasparnet> will try upgrading and see what happens
2014-02-18T22:20:35 * yzen has quit
2014-02-18T22:23:55 <kasparnet> avtar: ok so it\'s not the server version
2014-02-18T22:24:02 <kasparnet> node version*
2014-02-18T22:24:25 <kasparnet> I\'m unable to run in production mode as I dont have a couchdb running on my machine
2014-02-18T22:24:39 <kasparnet> so I just get a connection refused error when it attempts to hit that
2014-02-18T22:25:49 <avtar> there don\'t appear to be any couch related errors on that vm
2014-02-18T22:27:33 <avtar> kasparnet: what else is running locally?
2014-02-18T22:27:33 <kasparnet> avtar: does couch give an error if one attempts to retrieve a document that is not present?
2014-02-18T22:27:40 <kasparnet> on my machine?
2014-02-18T22:27:45 <kasparnet> nothing
2014-02-18T22:28:02 <avtar> kasparnet: yes, it gives a 404
2014-02-18T22:28:11 <kasparnet> ok
2014-02-18T22:29:13 <avtar> so the tests that you\'re running locally are with the preferences server running in development?
2014-02-18T22:29:22 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-02-18T22:29:38 <avtar> i can switch to that
2014-02-18T22:29:39 <avtar> one sec
2014-02-18T22:29:50 <kasparnet> great - thanks avtar
2014-02-18T22:33:05 <avtar> kasparnet: could you try now?
2014-02-18T22:34:17 <kasparnet> avtar: no errors and it looks like it worked
2014-02-18T22:35:35 <kasparnet> yup, I can retrieve the NP set now
2014-02-18T22:35:54 <kasparnet> so this is pretty weird
2014-02-18T22:39:40 <kasparnet> I\'m not sure what the best next step is..
2014-02-18T22:40:10 <kasparnet> could you perhaps change line 9 of /srv/nodejs/gpii_pref_server/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs/production.json
2014-02-18T22:40:16 <kasparnet> to read "logging": true,
2014-02-18T22:40:28 <kasparnet> and restart server in production mode
2014-02-18T22:40:41 <kasparnet> (only relevant if you have access to console output from server)
2014-02-18T22:40:52 <kasparnet> it might give us a clue to where the hell that error is coming from
2014-02-18T22:41:04 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2014-02-18T22:41:25 * anastasiac has quit
2014-02-18T22:41:52 <avtar> kasparnet: i believe justin and i had that enabled when this issue first surfaced
2014-02-18T22:42:03 <avtar> although that was before any recent changes to master
2014-02-18T22:43:40 <kasparnet> avtar: I *think* the good dr. BASSMAN has enabled some more error printing in the kettle framework, is that correct Bosmon?
2014-02-18T22:43:58 <avtar> kasparnet: it\'s back in production again if you want to test
2014-02-18T22:44:09 * yzen joined the channel
2014-02-18T22:44:25 <kasparnet> thanks avtar
2014-02-18T22:44:55 <kasparnet> ok, got my {"isError":true,"message":"Cannot read property \'isError\' of undefined"}, avtar
2014-02-18T22:45:00 <kasparnet> do you have anything useful in the logs?
2014-02-18T22:45:11 <avtar> agh new and delightful errors
2014-02-18T22:45:27 <kasparnet> yay
2014-02-18T22:45:32 <avtar> http://pastie.org/pastes/8746898/text
2014-02-18T22:48:41 <kasparnet> thanks avtar!
2014-02-18T22:54:07 <kasparnet> avtar: I take it that your couchDB instance isn\'t exposed to the outside world?!
2014-02-18T22:54:18 <avtar> it isn\'t
2014-02-18T22:54:29 <kasparnet> ok
2014-02-18T22:55:07 <avtar> would you like access to it?
2014-02-18T22:56:12 <kasparnet> if it\'s not too much work
2014-02-18T22:56:50 <avtar> it looks like you still have an account on that vm
2014-02-18T22:57:03 <kasparnet> else I can try to install it on my windows VM tomorrow - seems like it\'s just running an .exe installer
2014-02-18T22:57:53 <kasparnet> it might be easier that way - because I wanted to configure my local preferences server to point to the couch DB backend

2014-02-18T13:58:48 <jhung> Justin_o: I was thinking for tomorrow\'s community meeting, we can go ahead with a Framework tutorial using Foundation. We\'ll treat it as a framework workshop in general. Principles should be the same regardless of which framework we choose. Sound okay?
2014-02-18T13:59:45 <Justin_o> jhung: sure, if we haven\'t come to a conclusion on which framework to chose we should also try to talk about that too for a least a bit of time.. whether at the beginning or end

2014-02-18T14:59:26 <jhung> anastasiac: I noticed that the IDI dev branch has content that is not in the live site. In particular some content in people.php present in dev are missing.
2014-02-18T15:00:15 <anastasiac> jhung: do you mean dev contains stuff that\'s not on the production site? or vice-versa?
2014-02-18T15:02:37 <jhung> anastasiac: stuff on dev site that is not in production. At least when I look at contents of people.php on dev site and look for them on the current live site, certain people are not there.
2014-02-18T15:03:15 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, that\'s the way it should be right now. I\'ve merged the new stuff into dev, where we should double-check it and make sure it\'s all ok. If so, I\'ll merge it into master and it will get onto the production site. Make sense?
2014-02-18T15:03:35 <anastasiac> jhung, this is the IDI-118 stuff
2014-02-18T15:03:48 <jhung> anastasiac: yes. I thought that was done already?
2014-02-18T15:04:02 <anastasiac> checking
2014-02-18T15:05:35 <anastasiac> nope, jhung, not merged into master yet. Delayed by my trip last week. Could you have a look at dev, test links, check spelling, etc, let me know if everything is ok?
2014-02-18T15:06:03 <jhung> anastasiac:  sure
2014-02-18T15:06:11 <anastasiac> thanks much, jhung
2014-02-18T15:06:55 <jhung> anastasiac: we should also talk about the community meeting happening tomorrow. Let me know when you\'re al caught up and we can figure something out. I think Justin_o may want to be in that chat as well.

2014-02-18T15:46:09 <clown> or merge, or whatever the correct term is.

2014-02-18T15:46:43 <clown> a question, if you have a moment.
2014-02-18T15:47:33 <clown> I keep running into this.  There are commits from master that I have to keep applying to make the services work.
2014-02-18T15:47:44 <clown> The main problem is .../linux/gpii.js
2014-02-18T15:48:22 <clown> it\'s the line that defines the node environmnet for kettle.
2014-02-18T15:50:24 <clown> I\'m wondering if there is a way to get that into your packagekitBridge branch.
2014-02-18T15:50:45 <clown> Or, maybe the better question is:  what is the status of your packagekitBridge branch?

2014-02-18T16:06:06 <jhung> Justin_o: sounds fine to me.
2014-02-18T16:06:42 <anastasiac> works for me. Do we want to just stay in Connect, jhung and Justin_o?
2014-02-18T16:06:56 <anastasiac> rather than return to desks, start up skype...
2014-02-18T16:06:56 <Justin_o> Sure that will work.
2014-02-18T16:07:40 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o - that works for me.
2014-02-18T16:10:05 <jhernandez> clown: sorry, was in another termianl - right now my packagekitBridge is out of date
2014-02-18T16:10:24 <jhernandez> I definetly have to sync it with master
2014-02-18T16:10:40 <clown> right, I agree  :-)_
2014-02-18T16:11:34 <clown> Since, I have to rememer now to merge (locally) the changes from master into your packagekitBridge branch in order to launch the system, and test things.
2014-02-18T16:11:42 <clown> I can keep doing that, jhernandez.
2014-02-18T16:11:56 <clown> I guess I wanted to know what your plans are in terms of that merge?
2014-02-18T16:13:53 <jhernandez> well, right now I think we have this packagekit module ready to be included into master
2014-02-18T16:14:09 <jhernandez> next, we have to make use of it within the architecture
2014-02-18T16:16:03 <clown> right, that\'s what I\'ve been looking into, although there is a learning curve there.
2014-02-18T16:16:36 <clown> okay, that answers my question, jhernandez.  Thanks.
2014-02-18T16:17:05 <jhernandez> clown: yw
2014-02-18T16:18:07 <jhernandez> and yes, there\'s a learning curve I also have to overcome
2014-02-18T16:18:19 <jhernandez> :)

2014-02-18T17:09:20 <colinclark> Morning, michelled
2014-02-18T17:09:22 <colinclark> or afternoon
2014-02-18T17:09:26 <colinclark> or whatever time it is
2014-02-18T17:09:41 <michelled> hi colinclark
2014-02-18T17:10:08 <colinclark> I\'ve found it quite viable to do code reviews while I\'m sitting in sessions here
2014-02-18T17:10:25 <colinclark> so if there are some pull requests you think I can take a look at, can you make me a little list?
2014-02-18T17:10:45 <colinclark> I have Windows and Linux GPII VMs
2014-02-18T17:10:49 <colinclark> but no RFID reader
2014-02-18T17:10:52 <colinclark> kasparnet: ^
2014-02-18T17:10:54 <michelled> for sure colinclark!
2014-02-18T17:11:23 <kasparnet> yay colinclark
2014-02-18T17:12:28 <michelled> colinclark: this might be a good place to start: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/181
2014-02-18T17:15:19 <kasparnet> michelled, colinclark: I\'m suddenly wondering if I should update that pull request
2014-02-18T17:15:42 <kasparnet> and move the new preferences sets to a subfolder called "review2
2014-02-18T17:15:51 <kasparnet> and do likewise for the device reporter
2014-02-18T17:16:26 <kasparnet> "great way to ruin colins review initiative, Kasper"
2014-02-18T17:16:29 <kasparnet> yeah, sorry :(
2014-02-18T17:16:30 <michelled> kasparnet: I don\'t think that makes sense. don\'t we want to keep these sets for the future?
2014-02-18T17:17:01 <michelled> we chose them for a reason - although perhaps we should properly consider their names
2014-02-18T17:17:21 <michelled> the name of each set should tell people something about how they should be used or what to expect.
2014-02-18T17:18:10 <michelled> so we probably don\'t\' want \'review 2\' in the names
2014-02-18T17:18:29 <michelled> but instead something descriptive
2014-02-18T17:19:28 <kasparnet> yeah, you might have a point
2014-02-18T17:19:39 <kasparnet> though we do have: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-502 as well
2014-02-18T17:20:35 <kasparnet> but yeah - I guess at least, as you say, these files have a documented purpose - unlike most other NP sets
2014-02-18T17:21:03 <michelled> I suppose it\'s up to colinclark, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if he\'d want at least some movement towards 502 in the 383 pull

2014-02-18T17:25:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: i left a comment on the pull request for FLUID-5275. The licenses for the 3rd party libraries are missing from custom builds
2014-02-18T17:28:39 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o, will take a look
2014-02-18T17:28:49 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2014-02-18T17:54:08 <colinclark> michelled, kasparnet: Sorry, we had break and I sort of lost the trajectory of this thread
2014-02-18T17:54:14 <colinclark> is there something I should review?
2014-02-18T17:54:21 <michelled> kasparnet: any reason you haven\'t merged this one? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/203
2014-02-18T17:54:29 <colinclark> or something you need help deciding on?
2014-02-18T17:54:45 * jhung has quit
2014-02-18T17:54:48 <michelled> colinclark: how about this one? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/193
2014-02-18T17:54:48 <kasparnet> michelled: yeah - I helped him write up those code changes
2014-02-18T17:54:53 <kasparnet> michelled: so cant review it
2014-02-18T17:55:01 <michelled> kasparnet: oh, so you need another reviewer?
2014-02-18T17:55:10 <kasparnet> yeah :(
2014-02-18T17:55:12 <michelled> colinclark: either of those two :)
2014-02-18T17:55:44 <colinclark> which two? #193 and #203?
2014-02-18T17:55:53 <michelled> yep
2014-02-18T17:55:56 <colinclark> okay
2014-02-18T17:55:58 <colinclark> duly noted
2014-02-18T17:55:59 <kasparnet> yay
2014-02-18T18:10:20 <colinclark> kasparnet: Can we chat here?
2014-02-18T18:10:51 <colinclark> So I\'m confused by the relationship between the PMT, the preference sets we\'re creating, and the solutions entries for our SP3 applications
2014-02-18T18:11:17 <colinclark> So the PMT allows users to create a preference set containing common terms, right?
2014-02-18T18:23:03 <kasparnet> colinclark: sorry - off for dinner, will be back in 30 mins or so
2014-02-18T18:23:16 <colinclark> ok
