b'2014-11-27T16:51:09 <clown> i am also going to try the RFID rings, jhernandez
2014-11-27T16:51:22 <clown> although I might not get that working in virtual machine.
2014-11-27T16:51:32 <jhernandez> no
2014-11-27T16:51:38 <jhernandez> not working right now
2014-11-27T16:52:13 <jhernandez> that is what I was about starting to check now
2014-11-27T16:53:01 <clown> jhernandez, you are always one step ahead of me.  :-)
2014-11-27T16:53:14 <jhernandez> yeah, sorry
2014-11-27T16:53:17 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-27T16:54:18 <jhernandez> apparently, we\'re missing pyscard
2014-11-27T16:55:31 <jhernandez> but my fedora box doesn\'t want to start again after a reboot
2014-11-27T16:55:44 <jhernandez> :/
2014-11-27T16:55:48 <clown> now you\'ve done it.  you\'ve mangled it completely.
2014-11-27T16:55:54 <jhernandez> hahahah
2014-11-27T16:56:03 * clown looks for psycard
2014-11-27T16:56:26 <jhernandez> dunno if it\'s packaged for fedora
2014-11-27T16:57:28 <clown> I haven\'t found anything yet, but I\'ll try a couple other paths.
2014-11-27T16:59:19 <jhernandez> via easy_install|pip ?
2014-11-27T16:59:57 <clown> I found an rpm, but for Fedora 12.
2014-11-27T17:00:42 <clown> http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscard/files/pyscard/pyscard%201.6.12/
2014-11-27T17:01:11 <clown> what is "easy_install|pip"?
2014-11-27T17:02:03 <jhernandez> it\'s for installing from the python\'s analog of perl\'s cpan
2014-11-27T17:02:07 <clown> Also this:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscard/files/pyscard/pyscard%201.6.12/
2014-11-27T17:02:13 <clown> gah!
2014-11-27T17:02:21 <clown> this:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscard/files/pyscard/pyscard%201.6.12/
2014-11-27T17:02:23 <jhernandez> but yeah, you can grab and build
2014-11-27T17:02:38 <clown> why can\'t I paste the correct url?  (rhetorical)
2014-11-27T17:02:51 <clown> http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscard/files/pyscard/pyscard%201.6.12/
2014-11-27T17:03:00 <clown> grrrrrr.....
2014-11-27T17:03:50 <clown> oh, that is right url.
2014-11-27T17:04:09 <clown> not it isn\'t.  this is very weird.
2014-11-27T17:05:56 <clown> https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2014-August/136902.html
2014-11-27T17:06:04 <clown> jhernandez ^  (finally).
2014-11-27T17:07:45 <clown> the package you want is actually named "pyscard":  pyscard-1.6.16-2.fc20.x86_64
2014-11-27T17:07:50 <clown> do a yum info on that.
2014-11-27T17:07:56 <clown> jhernandez ^
2014-11-27T17:10:12 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-27T17:10:15 <jhernandez> just installed
2014-11-27T17:10:20 <clown> me too
2014-11-27T17:14:32 <jhernandez> BUT, I\'m afraid that, even installing pyscard, it is not working
2014-11-27T17:15:38 * slim_jim has quit
2014-11-27T17:15:48 <jhernandez> BUT, we also agreed that it\'s unrelated to the changes on the fireball branch
2014-11-27T17:16:28 <clown> we did?  when did we agree to that? :-) (also rhetorical)
2014-11-27T17:16:30 <jhernandez> BUT (again), IIRC there is a pull request that fixes this issue
2014-11-27T17:16:35 <jhernandez> heh
2014-11-27T17:16:38 <jhernandez> was on skype
2014-11-27T17:17:14 <jhernandez> (the decision)
2014-11-27T17:17:18 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/linux-rfid-user-listener/pull/1
2014-11-27T17:18:36 <jhernandez> s/decision/agreement
2014-11-27T17:19:20 <jhernandez> now, I\'m so so sorry to say that I need to leave
2014-11-27T17:19:59 <clown> jhernandez:  not problem.  nearly lunch here, and after that, I must spend some cycles on W3C stuff.
2014-11-27T17:20:32 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-27T17:23:14 <jhernandez> as always, ping me here so I can read it later

2014-11-27T15:26:56 <clown> good morning, jhernandez.
2014-11-27T15:27:00 <clown> I got your patch this morning, and the linux acceptance tests now pass.
2014-11-27T15:27:16 <clown> I\'d tell kasparnet, but he\'s not here.
2014-11-27T15:28:25 <jhernandez> clown: well, that pull request was superseded by https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/62
2014-11-27T15:28:36 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-27T15:28:58 <jhernandez> and another one is coming soon
2014-11-27T15:29:19 <michelled> Bosmon2: are you there?
2014-11-27T15:29:27 <clown> let me know when it arrives, and I\'ll get it then, and test again.  :-)
2014-11-27T15:30:07 <jhernandez> clown: cool, thanks!
2014-11-27T15:30:30 <michelled> jhernandez: question for you
2014-11-27T15:30:35 <clown> jhernandez, there is a "UnitTests.sh"  in linux "tests" folder.  I don\'t think it\'s covered by "node AcceptanceTests.js".  I run it separately?
2014-11-27T15:30:45 * clown let\'s all gang up on jhernandez.
2014-11-27T15:30:48 <michelled> :)
2014-11-27T15:31:04 * clown his last name is "Criticalpath".
2014-11-27T15:32:33 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2014-11-27T15:32:44 <michelled> hey, Bosmon7
2014-11-27T15:32:46 <michelled> :)
2014-11-27T15:33:03 <Bosmon7> Hey there - you PEIXXX!
2014-11-27T15:33:17 <michelled> is this they final prefs set format? http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Needs_and_Preferences_Set_Format
2014-11-27T15:33:44 <Bosmon7> michelled - that would be a better question for KASPARNETTT
2014-11-27T15:33:47 <clown> jhernandez, I ran the  UnitTests.sh anyhow.
2014-11-27T15:34:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: are you going to be around for a bit, i have some questions for you too
2014-11-27T15:34:43 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes I will be here for a bit
2014-11-27T15:36:41 <clown> jhernandez:  I uncommented the XRANDR tests and I think they fail.
2014-11-27T15:37:20 <clown> For example, "X Error of failed request:  BadName (named color or font does not exist) "
2014-11-27T15:38:27 <clown> is that what your latest pull requests fix, jhernandez?
2014-11-27T15:47:14 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-11-27T15:47:27 <jhernandez> sorry, wasn\'t taking attention here
2014-11-27T15:47:56 <jhernandez> clown: no, xrandr is coming
2014-11-27T15:48:22 <jhernandez> now I\'m finishing with the universal side of it
2014-11-27T15:49:12 <jhernandez> michelled: shoot it - and make sure to put my name in the beginning so the message will be higlighted :)
2014-11-27T15:50:07 <michelled> jhernandez: I asked Bosmon7 already - I\'m just trying to figure out what the final prefs format is :)
2014-11-27T15:50:21 <michelled> I think I have it http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Needs_and_Preferences_Set_Format but kasparnet probably needs to agree :)
2014-11-27T15:56:40 <clown> okay, jhernandez.
2014-11-27T15:58:25 <jhernandez> michelled: yeah, that\'s it. Also, you can see the real new NP sets in kasparnet\'s GPII-941 branch
2014-11-27T15:59:24 <jhernandez> michelled: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-941/testData/preferences
2014-11-27T16:03:57 <jhernandez> clown: okay, *I think* now I it\'s all in place for you to test
2014-11-27T16:04:29 <clown> jhernandez:  pull 62? (https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/62)
2014-11-27T16:04:34 <jhernandez> now we have two separate pull requests for linux and one for universal
2014-11-27T16:04:46 <michelled> ah, thanks jhernandez that\'s helpful
2014-11-27T16:04:54 <jhernandez> michelled: yw
2014-11-27T16:05:23 <clown> jhernandez:  just to be clear about the pull requests...
2014-11-27T16:05:49 <jhernandez> clown: linux -> linux/pulls/62 and linux/pulls/63
2014-11-27T16:05:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: one thing is that https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566 is ready for another round of review
2014-11-27T16:06:22 <clown> it\'s still kasparnet\'s GPII-941 for universal, and ..
2014-11-27T16:06:23 <jhernandez> clown: universal -> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/284
2014-11-27T16:06:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: when you are free to talk was going to ask you a couple of things related to the security ui\'s i\'m working on
2014-11-27T16:06:30 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - thanks - I will have a look this afternoon
2014-11-27T16:06:45 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - on a call with simonjb right now but can talk later
2014-11-27T16:07:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :) thought so, i can hear simonjb talking
2014-11-27T16:07:18 <clown> oh, so it\'s kasparnet\'s GPII=941 + pull 284 for universal, jhernandez?
2014-11-27T16:07:42 * jhernandez nods
2014-11-27T16:08:10 <clown> and abm26\'s GPII-434 + pulls 62 and 63 for linux?
2014-11-27T16:08:21 <clown> *amb26
2014-11-27T16:08:26 <jhernandez> you can just merge my branch in there on top of kasparnet\'s
2014-11-27T16:08:35 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-27T16:08:55 <clown> understood jhernandez.
2014-11-27T16:08:57 <jhernandez> in the same way, you can just merge both on top of amb26\'s
2014-11-27T16:09:01 <jhernandez> cool
2014-11-27T16:09:07 <clown> thanks.
2014-11-27T16:09:13 <jhernandez> thanks to you!
2014-11-27T16:09:14 <clown> I\'ll let you know soon-ish.
2014-11-27T16:09:22 <jhernandez> okey dokey!
2014-11-27T16:09:30 <jhernandez> I\'ll be around
2014-11-27T16:11:30 <jhernandez> in fact, I\'m doing the same as you in 2 other linux boxes
2014-11-27T16:11:32 <jhernandez> :)
