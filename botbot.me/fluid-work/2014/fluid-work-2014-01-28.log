2014-01-28T21:41:12 <anastasiac> jhung, I've pushed the changes to the links; and I notice that if I remove your setting of the height of .flbuild-major-demo, the column weirdness at the bottom disappears. Investigating...
2014-01-28T21:46:32 <jhung> anastasiac: I pushed up changes to me repo along with your work merged.
2014-01-28T21:46:41 <anastasiac> yep, got it jhung
2014-01-28T21:48:00 <jhung> anastasiac: I'm going to tweak the anchor underlines so there isn't a gap with the text.
2014-01-28T21:48:08 <anastasiac> k
2014-01-28T21:49:11 <jhung> anastasiac:  I know why the layout looks a bit odd.
2014-01-28T21:49:24 <anastasiac> can you fix it?
2014-01-28T21:51:03 <anastasiac> jhung: ^
2014-01-28T21:51:06 <jhung> anastasiac: short answer yes. It would require removing the CSS colour overlay. Reason: The text shifting is leaving a void that can't be filled.
2014-01-28T21:51:06 <anastasiac> or should I work on it?
2014-01-28T21:51:21 <anastasiac> ah, interesting
2014-01-28T21:51:43 <jhung> I can do it anastasiac since I have the images here. Maybe you can look into the anchor styling?
2014-01-28T21:51:48 <anastasiac> will do

2014-01-28T22:03:30 <anastasiac> great, jhung. I've solved the link underlines, and the variable width backgrounds. I'll push in a minute

2014-01-28T22:08:16 <anastasiac> jon, I've pushed my branch with the underline fixes. So the images are no longer going to have the coloured tint? You're not going to burn it in?
2014-01-28T22:08:46 <jhung> anastasiac: the images will have the colours added.
2014-01-28T22:08:56 <anastasiac> ok, cool
2014-01-28T22:09:02 <jhung> if you merged my branch you should have it. Maybe clear your cache?
2014-01-28T22:09:28 <anastasiac> cache is off
2014-01-28T22:09:30 <anastasiac> I did merge
2014-01-28T22:09:58 <anastasiac> hm
2014-01-28T22:10:06 <anastasiac> ah, there
2014-01-28T22:10:09 <anastasiac> better, jhung

2014-01-28T22:10:44 <anastasiac> so jhung, I see two remaining issues: link in Prefs Framework section should be on separate lines;
2014-01-28T22:10:52 <anastasiac> links in Infusion section should be closer to each other

2014-01-28T22:11:37 <jhung> anastasiac: yes there are some text flow issues when going to a mobile layout within the showcase section. I'm looking into that now.
2014-01-28T22:11:48 <anastasiac> ok, I'll work on the two I found

2014-01-28T18:06:04 <jhung> Justin_o_: anastasiac and I have decided to use Bootstrap for the build site because it\'ll help get us to something usable more quickly. Do you have any thoughts on that?
2014-01-28T18:07:14 <cindyli> Justin_o_: the pull request for metadata FLOE-164 is ready to be reviewed - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/20
2014-01-28T18:13:45 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'ve pushed a skeleton HTML file to my github: It should be enough for you to start on the CSS: https://github.com/acheetham/build.fluidproject.org/tree/FLUID-5259
2014-01-28T18:14:25 <anastasiac> jhung, feel free to modify classnames :-)
2014-01-28T18:15:43 <jhung> thanks anastasiac
2014-01-28T18:19:43 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'ve fleshed out a little bit of the content of the HTML, pushed to my repo. I\'m running out of things to do :-) How can I help you?
2014-01-28T18:20:37 <anastasiac> I will start learning Bootstrap
2014-01-28T18:20:46 <jhung> anastasiac:  sounds good.
2014-01-28T18:27:07 <anastasiac> FYI, jhung, my 5259 branch was not created based on master, it was created based on Justin_o_\'s gh-pages branch, so it\'s much cleaner than master
2014-01-28T18:27:56 <jhung> anastasiac: ah thanks for telling me. I\'ll ditch my fork and use that.
2014-01-28T18:28:08 <anastasiac> well, just ditch your branch

2014-01-28T18:47:15 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ve pushed up a minor change to my FLUID-5259 branch. I\'ve added bootstrap (you will need to download manually and extract to the ./lib/ folder to match the path). I\'ve also added a container and name space to the "top" container. I\'ll start with styling that?
2014-01-28T18:47:32 <anastasiac> sounds good, jhung
2014-01-28T18:48:09 <jhung> Feel free to start working on the "bottom" anastasiac. I\'ll avoid touching that container.

2014-01-28T18:48:20 <anastasiac> ok, jhun
2014-01-28T19:06:29 <anastasiac> jhung, what name are you giving to a css file for our own styles? and it\'ll be in a css folder, right?
2014-01-28T19:06:53 <jhung> anastasiac: yep. I\'m using styles.css
2014-01-28T19:07:04 <jhung> sorry, style.css

2014-01-28T19:09:17 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'ve pushed a first pass at some styling. Not sure if I\'m making best use of Bootstrap yet, but I\'m learning...
2014-01-28T19:09:41 <jhung> great! i\'ll take a look anastasiac
2014-01-28T19:09:53 <anastasiac> jhung, I moved the bottom into the "container" div that you marked
2014-01-28T19:10:07 <anastasiac> that\'s probably the only thing that might conflict with what you\'ve got
2014-01-28T19:10:33 <jhung> anastasiac okay. I\'ll watch out for that.

2014-01-28T20:27:07 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-01-28T20:27:34 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m working on it now. It\'s coming along.
2014-01-28T20:32:22 <jhung> anastasiac: right now I\'m trying to get the text positioned in the showcase demo containers along with the transparencies.
2014-01-28T20:38:37 <anastasiac> jhung, is there anything I can do to help? Or something else I can work on?
2014-01-28T20:40:21 <jhung> perhaps anastasiac. Let me get my changes committed and merged with your changes first. Maybe you can help me by experimenting with the positioning.
2014-01-28T20:40:35 <anastasiac> k
2014-01-28T20:44:31 <jhung> anastasiac: I
2014-01-28T20:44:40 <jhung> ve pushed up changes to my branch. Take a look.
2014-01-28T20:44:47 <anastasiac> k
2014-01-28T20:45:26 <anastasiac> oo, coming along nicely, jhung
2014-01-28T20:46:30 <jhung> thanks anastasiac. But the boxes aren\'t lining up properly. So right now I\'m playing around with positions and margins. The basic idea is to have 2 divs inside each showcase box. One for the colour overlay, and the other for the text.
2014-01-28T20:46:33 <anastasiac> so jhung, the images are being implemented as non-colourized images with a coloured overlay?
2014-01-28T20:46:48 <anastasiac> interesting
2014-01-28T20:46:56 <jhung> anastasiac: That\'s the way we did it in Floeproject.org.
2014-01-28T20:47:03 <anastasiac> oh, interesting!
2014-01-28T20:47:05 <jhung> But we don\'t have to do it that way\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-01-28T20:47:06 <anastasiac> I\'ll have a look
2014-01-28T20:47:33 <jhung> Actually since we\'re looking to do something quick, let\'s not worry about the overlay.
2014-01-28T20:48:26 <jhung> In which case I can just take the images I have from Floeproject.org and add the overlays using photoshop. I can do that now anastasiac
2014-01-28T20:48:57 <anastasiac> odd that the styles you used on floeproject.org don\'t work here, jhung
2014-01-28T20:50:04 <jhung> I\'m checking the markup there now. I may be missing something anastasiac
2014-01-28T20:52:32 <jhung> ah solved it. I was floating the overlay anastasiac - by removing it the boxes all line up much more nicely.
2014-01-28T20:52:36 <anastasiac> jhung, I notice that bootstrap is using pixels for font sizes; that\'s not going to work well with UIO
2014-01-28T20:53:13 <anastasiac> excellent, jhung, let me know when I can pull down your changes
2014-01-28T20:53:38 <jhung> Yes. That\'s a known issue anastasiac. the work-around is to do a custom build of Bootstrap using their builder.
2014-01-28T20:53:51 <anastasiac> oh, neat. At least that\'s an option
2014-01-28T20:53:52 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ll let you know when I have something.
2014-01-28T20:54:04 <anastasiac> shame on them!
2014-01-28T20:54:08 <jhung> Foundation on the other hand uses ems.
2014-01-28T20:56:45 <jhung> vjoanna: do you have an updated link for the fluid builder site? My link to the dropbox PDF no longer works.
2014-01-28T21:00:48 <vjoanna> jhung: oops sorry https://www.dropbox.com/s/2u1kzqgn3mbctxj/fluidProject-siterough.pdf pages 3-4
2014-01-28T21:01:04 <jhung> thanks vjoanna!
2014-01-28T21:02:49 <anastasiac> jhung, in the updated pdf file, you will notice that the second-last page is different from the the design you and I are currently working on
2014-01-28T21:03:16 <anastasiac> I suspect that this second-last page, without the images, is what we need to prioritize, but I should double-check that with michelled and Justin_o_
2014-01-28T21:06:36 <anastasiac> jhung, we\'re ok - keep going :-)
2014-01-28T21:06:57 <jhung> great thanks anastasiac
2014-01-28T21:07:02 <anastasiac> vjoanna, is there a specification for the fonts on the page?
2014-01-28T21:07:13 <anastasiac> my monospaced doesn\'t look as nice as yours :-)
2014-01-28T21:07:44 <vjoanna> oh yes - one sec
2014-01-28T21:08:27 <vjoanna> anastasiac: http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto+Slab:400,300,700,100

2014-01-28T21:23:36 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m going to merge your branch and push up to my repo in a sec. I don\'t want to get too far ahead of you. :)
2014-01-28T21:23:58 <anastasiac> perfect, jhung, let me know and I\'ll merge your changes
2014-01-28T21:26:51 <jhung> anastasiac: it merged cleanly but it doesn\'t look right. The two columns in the Bottom are not aligned properly. I\'m investigating now\xe2\x80\xa6
