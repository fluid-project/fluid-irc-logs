2014-11-25T16:12:32 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-25T16:12:59 <jhernandez> clown: what\'s up?
2014-11-25T16:13:37 <clown> I\'m wondering if you\'ve started on the change to the grunt to handle the gpii directory.
2014-11-25T16:14:26 <clown> and what does ":=" mean, jhernandez?
2014-11-25T16:15:18 <AlfredoM> clown: I think it\'s a finger mistake :D
2014-11-25T16:15:38 <clown> AlfredoM:  you\'re most likely correct!
2014-11-25T16:15:47 * clown needs more coffe...
2014-11-25T16:15:58 * clown and coffee too
2014-11-25T16:16:02 <jhernandez> clown: wrt grunt stuff - not yet
2014-11-25T16:16:14 <jhernandez> wrt := - AlfredoM is right
2014-11-25T16:16:28 <clown> jhernandez:  I have the time, if it would help you.
2014-11-25T16:16:46 <AlfredoM> :)
2014-11-25T16:17:29 <jhernandez> clown: I really don\'t care, go ahead if you have time right now to work on it
2014-11-25T16:17:39 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-25T16:18:17 <clown> jhernandez:  okay.  Is there an existing JIRA for it?  GPII-X?  Or should I create a new one.
2014-11-25T16:18:18 <clown> ?
2014-11-25T16:18:51 <clown> Or, put another way, which branch should I work off of?  Straigth off the master of GPII/linux?
2014-11-25T16:19:02 <jhernandez> yeah, that deserves a JIRA
2014-11-25T16:19:34 <clown> Okay, I\'ll create the JIRA, make the branch, and start on it.
2014-11-25T16:19:36 <jhernandez> it\'s safe enough to use master
2014-11-25T16:19:46 <clown> understood.
2014-11-25T16:19:53 <jhernandez> awesome!
2014-11-25T16:19:57 <jhernandez> clown: thanks!
2014-11-25T16:20:18 <clown> no problem, jhernandez.  Now you can go have a nice evening.
2014-11-25T16:20:19 <clown> :-)
2014-11-25T16:21:39 <jhernandez> heh, thanks, I\'ll still be here for a few more minutes but at 6 I have to leave

2014-11-25T17:59:26 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I wonder if you might know this about the GPII technology: Does GPII have any services that can query/determine the current device\xe2\x80\x99s existing settings, independent of any saved preferences?
