b'2014-04-16T16:52:20 <clown> which leads to:  is it our packagekit, or packagekit itself.  One thing to try is running pkcon, and seeing if that works (if you haven\'t already tried that).
2014-04-16T16:52:39 <jhernandez> it is hard to debug node.js add-ons within gdb
2014-04-16T16:52:54 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-04-16T16:53:40 <jhernandez> I\'m not sure how parsing the output from pkcon will be, but it\'s something I totally have in mind
2014-04-16T16:53:52 <clown> aside:  I mentioned that I have the source for pkcon printed out a while back.  I noticed that whereever our packagekit add on uses pk_client, pkcon uses pk_task.
2014-04-16T16:54:01 <clown> I don\'t know which is better.
2014-04-16T16:54:23 <clown> but, my guess is pk_task is better (since that\'s what the author of packagekit uses).
2014-04-16T16:54:26 <jhernandez> me neither
2014-04-16T16:54:48 <clown> but, I also worry that pk_task involves a layer of asynchrony and that might be bad for use.
2014-04-16T16:54:51 <clown> *us.
2014-04-16T16:55:24 <clown> I suppose I could make a branch and try ...
2014-04-16T16:56:09 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-04-16T16:57:17 <jhernandez> in fact, we would like to make use of that asynchrony layer, but still don\'t know how to deal with it
2014-04-16T16:57:23 <jhernandez> anyway ...
2014-04-16T16:57:24 <clown> right.
2014-04-16T16:57:33 <jhernandez> I think that there\'s a pk_task_sync
2014-04-16T16:57:43 <clown> took the words right out of my mouth.
2014-04-16T16:57:59 <clown> or "fingers" since I\'m typing, not talking.
2014-04-16T16:58:02 <jhernandez> xD
2014-04-16T16:58:41 <Bosmon> We tend to use the standard library "when.js" for dealing with awkward asynchrony cases currently
2014-04-16T16:58:46 <Bosmon> You can see some examples through the codebase
2014-04-16T16:58:57 <Bosmon> In the future we will be able to deal with this in the framework natively
2014-04-16T17:00:05 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yeah, I know about when.js and tried to create a "hello world" but didn\'t succeed on it
2014-04-16T17:00:22 <clown> where is when?
2014-04-16T17:00:23 * jhernandez sucks
2014-04-16T17:00:38 <clown> noh jhernandez is awesome.

2014-04-16T17:00:50 <clown> *nah,
2014-04-16T17:02:06 * jhernandez noted that now when\'s README includes a couple of examples
2014-04-16T17:02:14 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-16T17:02:30 <clown> I see it uses the "promise" concept.

2014-04-16T17:46:06 <anastasiac> michelled, cindyli has added the overlay panel to the md demo using simon\'s branch, so she\'s probably waiting for the merge

2014-04-16T18:05:52 <michelled> ok, pushing that
2014-04-16T18:05:57 <Bosmon> cheers!
2014-04-16T18:06:42 <michelled> Bosmon: how do you notice the perms so quickly? I need to add that to my checklist before pushing pull requests
2014-04-16T18:06:56 <Bosmon> michelled - I get a transcript whenever I merge up
2014-04-16T18:06:59 <Bosmon> Don\'t you?
2014-04-16T18:07:42 <Bosmon> Something like this:

2014-04-16T18:08:22 <anastasiac> michelled, I\'ve issued a pull request for the overview panel in the demos: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/491
2014-04-16T18:08:41 <michelled> yes, I do, Bosmon - but I guess I don\'t look at it very closely
2014-04-16T18:09:01 <michelled> or at least, haven\'t in the past
2014-04-16T18:09:30 <michelled> thanks anastasiac! that\'s exciting
2014-04-16T18:10:09 <anastasiac> michelled, I have one pending for the climate change demo, but since 5289 restructures the demo folder, I thought I\'d hold of til that goes in

2014-04-16T19:13:22 <jhernandez> you cannot run the entire framework at this moment, but it won\'t take much time to get it working
2014-04-16T19:13:54 <jhernandez> the point is that, right now, it just doesn\'t make sense
2014-04-16T19:15:23 <jhernandez> the process is still sync and blocking, so a \'login\' action will take long (until our calls to packageKit are finished)
2014-04-16T19:16:36 * clown nods
2014-04-16T19:16:37 <jhernandez> but at least, we\'re scaffolding it :)

2014-04-16T14:16:53 <jhung> cindyli: is it possible for the Metadata Demo to remember the state of the panel when moving from landing page to a resource? I.e. if the user has closed the panel in the landing page, it should appear closed in the resource.
2014-04-16T14:18:38 <cindyli> jhung: and vice verses when the user moves from the resource page to the landing page? basically the user\'s last choice is remembered? it should be doable.
2014-04-16T14:19:18 <jhung> cindyli: yes if moving back to landing page too (although "restart demo" should make the overview panel appear again).
2014-04-16T14:19:37 <cindyli> ok, jhung
2014-04-16T14:19:50 <jhung> thanks cindyli

2014-04-16T14:56:29 <anastasiac> cindyli, how\'s the overlay panel + metadata demo work going?
2014-04-16T15:07:20 <cindyli> anastasiac: the integration has been done, using simon\'s branch + latest master. jhung wants to keep track of user\'s selection on hiding/showing overview panel. working on that
2014-04-16T15:07:36 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\'m having a very strange problem upgrading the climate change demo to the latest master; something to do with a modelComponent\'s applier not expanding at all. Might you have some time today to work with me to figure this out?
2014-04-16T15:07:57 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac
2014-04-16T15:08:44 <jhung> cindyli, anastasiac: I have pushed up some more changes - this time revising the instruction text in the overview panel.

2014-04-16T15:40:19 <Bosmon> anastasiac - if you have an old-style component which is relying on "applier-sharing" you need to move its definition into "members"
2014-04-16T15:40:47 <anastasiac> ah, good to know, Bosmon, thanks
2014-04-16T15:40:52 <Bosmon> Although really this shouldn\'t be happening at all
2014-04-16T15:41:07 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s an example of an "unofficial practice" which escaped into the community through repeated cut and paste : P
2014-04-16T15:41:09 <anastasiac> it turned out that wasn\'t the problem. The problem was the order of inclusion of the JS files

2014-04-16T16:38:52 <clown> jhernandez:  when can we meet so you can tell me what you\'ve been up to (DR stuff)?
2014-04-16T16:39:17 <jhernandez> clown: now I have some time
2014-04-16T16:39:36 <clown> now is good for me too, jhernandez.
2014-04-16T16:39:39 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-16T16:39:54 <jhernandez> well, as I\'ve said
2014-04-16T16:41:17 <jhernandez> I moved the code out from gpii.js and added a new module, linuxDeviceReporter
2014-04-16T16:41:37 <clown> as part of .../linux/node_modules?
2014-04-16T16:41:44 * jhernandez nods
2014-04-16T16:41:56 <jhernandez> GPII_linux//node_modules/
2014-04-16T16:42:38 <jhernandez> will push it as soon as I clean up the code from debugging lines
2014-04-16T16:42:41 * clown is not familiar with GPII_linux.  which folder is that?
2014-04-16T16:42:45 <jhernandez> heh
2014-04-16T16:42:53 <jhernandez> github.com/GPII/linux
2014-04-16T16:43:12 <clown> re:  pushing/cleaning up - sure, understood.
2014-04-16T16:43:16 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-16T16:44:00 <clown> and re:  github.com/GPII/linux \xe2\x80\x94 right.  that\'s what I call the "linux" folder, but I suppose that could be confused with your jhernandez/linux branch on github.
2014-04-16T16:44:06 <jhernandez> basically, copied https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules/deviceReporter and made a few changes on it
2014-04-16T16:44:07 <clown> so, I understand what you mean now.
2014-04-16T16:44:42 <clown> wow, that\'s what I started with, but ran into some funny behaviour, so I backed out.
2014-04-16T16:45:03 <clown> and tried to figure out what I did wrong.
2014-04-16T16:45:04 <jhernandez> now I can run it as a standalone kettle app and listening on a port in the same way the deviceReporter works
2014-04-16T16:45:16 <clown> very nice.
2014-04-16T16:45:40 <clown> well, I can wait until you\'ve pushed (and I\'ll pull) to get a better idea of what you did.
2014-04-16T16:45:46 <clown> what\'s your preference?
2014-04-16T16:46:09 <jhernandez> I\'d say you to wait
2014-04-16T16:46:24 <clown> all right.
2014-04-16T16:46:28 <jhernandez> honestly, the code is a bit nasty
2014-04-16T16:46:52 <jhernandez> Bosmon: would kill me for it
2014-04-16T16:47:06 <jhernandez> xD
2014-04-16T16:47:13 <clown> not \xe2\x80\xa6 the wrath of Bosmon!
2014-04-16T16:47:32 <jhernandez> but ... something is better than anything
2014-04-16T16:47:35 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-16T16:47:43 <clown> and something can be improved...
2014-04-16T16:47:46 <clown> indeed.
2014-04-16T16:48:19 <jhernandez> when I push the code I\'ll try to document it in the same way I did the last time
2014-04-16T16:48:53 <clown> which was?  I have forgotten.  Was it comments in the code, or on the jira?
2014-04-16T16:49:03 <clown> oh, no the google doc.
2014-04-16T16:49:04 <jhernandez> either in GPII-413 or in our google doc
2014-04-16T16:49:07 <clown> now I remember.
2014-04-16T16:49:09 <jhernandez> (or both)
2014-04-16T16:49:10 <jhernandez> xD
2014-04-16T16:49:15 <jhernandez> but I will
2014-04-16T16:49:16 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-16T16:49:24 <clown> ping me too, please?
2014-04-16T16:49:30 <clown> so I can pull it.
2014-04-16T16:49:31 <jhernandez> of course
2014-04-16T16:49:38 <clown> thanks.
2014-04-16T16:49:54 <jhernandez> yw
2014-04-16T16:49:56 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-16T16:50:37 <jhernandez> btw, looks like our packaKit add-on is a little bit buggy
2014-04-16T16:50:43 <jhernandez> *packageKit

2014-04-16T16:51:08 <jhernandez> Segmentation fault
2014-04-16T16:51:08 <clown> I can look into that too, if you want.
2014-04-16T16:51:10 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-04-16T16:51:14 * yzen joined the channel
2014-04-16T16:51:29 * clown bets that those seg faults happen only on ubuntu.
2014-04-16T16:51:30 <jhernandez> but it sometimes happens on my openSUSE
2014-04-16T16:51:32 <clown> ;-)
2014-04-16T16:51:44 * clown or openSUSE.
2014-04-16T16:51:46 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-04-16T16:52:16 <jhernandez> yeah, I\'m not sure what\'s happening
