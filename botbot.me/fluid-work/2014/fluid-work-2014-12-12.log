b'2014-12-12T17:11:44 <andres_malarres> don\'t like each other
2014-12-12T17:11:57 <Bosmon> ok
2014-12-12T17:12:00 <Bosmon> what symptoms do you get?
2014-12-12T17:12:39 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I got it working by using the same approach as in orca
2014-12-12T17:12:52 <jhernandez> let me paste what I did
2014-12-12T17:12:54 <Bosmon> jhernandez - great
2014-12-12T17:13:04 <andres_malarres> fever, cry at night and occasional attempts to leave it everything and start a chiringuito business by the beach
2014-12-12T17:13:17 <Bosmon> Those are powerful symptoms
2014-12-12T17:13:26 <andres_malarres> talkback1 is working properly
2014-12-12T17:13:27 <Bosmon> I have all except the final part
2014-12-12T17:13:33 <andres_malarres> but omnitor1 doesnt
2014-12-12T17:14:03 <Bosmon> Unfortunately unlike you I am not imaginitive to conceive of an alternate career
2014-12-12T17:14:27 <colinclark> That might be the greatest quote all day
2014-12-12T17:14:31 <colinclark> If not all week
2014-12-12T17:14:36 <colinclark> even better than kasparnet\'s death rays
2014-12-12T17:14:42 <colinclark> "fever, cry at night and occasional attempts to leave it everything and start a chiringuito business by the beach"
2014-12-12T17:15:12 <andres_malarres> ahhahaha you were asking for symptoms
2014-12-12T17:15:12 <Bosmon> "in Catalan called a guingueta, or, by influence of Spanish, a XIRRINGGUITTO"
2014-12-12T17:15:28 <colinclark> my goal i think would just be to hang out at the chinguito
2014-12-12T17:15:31 <colinclark> rather than starting the business
2014-12-12T17:15:46 <colinclark> perhaps sail my boat to the chiringuito
2014-12-12T17:15:50 <colinclark> if that is possible
2014-12-12T17:16:06 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-12-12T17:16:24 <andres_malarres> hey you could start a spin-off of my chiringuito in mekong river
2014-12-12T17:16:30 <andres_malarres> i foresee you
2014-12-12T17:16:33 <colinclark> :)
2014-12-12T17:16:36 <jhernandez> Bosmon: updated the stypi with the solution I applied
2014-12-12T17:17:01 <Bosmon> jhernandez - yup, that\'s ok
2014-12-12T17:20:51 <Bosmon> andres_malarres - what happens with that **OMNNITTOUR**?
2014-12-12T17:21:31 * colinclark has quit
2014-12-12T17:21:35 <jhernandez> ok, now it is applying the changes on the model, but I\'m not getting any "model updated" signal
2014-12-12T17:21:45 <andres_malarres> nothing, i did my classic chusca logs and it doesn\'t enter in startActivityByPackageName
2014-12-12T17:23:39 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-12-12T17:24:43 <jhernandez> I have included the appropriate modelListener, and another listener attached to the signal being emit when the change on the model happens
2014-12-12T17:27:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - does the model actually change?
2014-12-12T17:27:36 <Bosmon> sorry jhernandez
2014-12-12T17:27:38 * avtar joined the channel
2014-12-12T17:28:08 <Bosmon> andres_malarres - do you seem to get the right payload once you have got to the LifecycleManager?
2014-12-12T17:28:31 <andres_malarres> http://pastebin.com/eXivjKCq for an output of the regular omnitor1.json lines 48/49 show that installedSolutions never ends to log its output
2014-12-12T17:29:00 <andres_malarres> but that doesn\'t have to be the problem neccessarily
2014-12-12T17:29:09 <Bosmon> andres_malarres - by this point in the LifecycleManager: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L413
2014-12-12T17:29:25 <Bosmon> On this line, "solutions" should have the complete payload that it has built up, ready to apply
2014-12-12T17:29:43 <Bosmon> You can try logging it to the console with a JSON.stringify(solutions, null, 2);
2014-12-12T17:30:20 <andres_malarres> gonna try
2014-12-12T17:30:55 <Bosmon> Make sure that beach with the chiringuito supports JSON.stringify : P
2014-12-12T17:31:06 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, it changes
2014-12-12T17:31:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have a couple minutes to read over the new content added in this pull request to make sure it is okay.. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/37 i can merge it if you think it\'s good
2014-12-12T17:31:47 <kasparnet> Bosmon: you\'re in high demand today :)
2014-12-12T17:31:51 <kasparnet> (again today)
2014-12-12T17:31:51 <jhernandez> in fact, your 12-times-rety-from-the-hell has stopped bugging me
2014-12-12T17:31:55 <jhernandez> :P
2014-12-12T17:31:59 <kasparnet> lol
2014-12-12T17:35:04 <Bosmon> jhernandez - how do you know it changes?
2014-12-12T17:35:07 <jhernandez> andres_malarres: our buffer in android for outputting stuff has limits
2014-12-12T17:35:27 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I KNOW!!!
2014-12-12T17:35:29 <jhernandez> :P
2014-12-12T17:35:42 <jhernandez> it is
2014-12-12T17:36:02 <jhernandez> or, let me double check it
2014-12-12T17:36:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks ok to me
2014-12-12T17:36:41 <andres_malarres> jhernandez Bosmon only a few lines
2014-12-12T17:36:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks

2014-12-12T17:38:07 <andres_malarres> (got tired of pastebin\'s captcha)
2014-12-12T17:39:58 <avtar> kasparnet: there was some activity last night related to running the latest preferences server in production https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2014-12-11/?msg=27355328&page=2
2014-12-12T17:41:22 <kasparnet> ah yes, I saw that
2014-12-12T17:41:36 <kasparnet> I\'ve been clever enough to cover myself from public shaming though: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/preferencesServer.txt#L5
2014-12-12T17:42:09 <kasparnet> I guess the preferences server has never been tested with CouchDB
2014-12-12T17:43:35 <avtar> so what do we do now?
2014-12-12T17:43:35 <kasparnet> So I guess the setup we would like to run the preferences server with is that it uses a couchDB backend and only have the absolutely vital services (ontolgy and raw prefs server) components running with it... does that sound sensible avtar / Bosmon ?
2014-12-12T17:43:54 <kasparnet> I can try fixing up that file so it runs properly
2014-12-12T17:44:03 <kasparnet> and then send you a link to a branch

2014-12-12T17:47:52 <jhernandez> andres_malarres: take a look at your stypi - I added something
2014-12-12T17:48:13 <andres_malarres> hey!
2014-12-12T17:48:25 <avtar> kasparnet: i\'m going to be rather frank now, i hope this doesn\'t throw you off
2014-12-12T17:48:28 <andres_malarres> y tried {} but not { the common prefs }
2014-12-12T17:49:01 <jhernandez> kasparnet: that\'s true, I\'m like Chuck Norris -> http://sobersallydiaries.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/h40ce994e.jpeg
2014-12-12T17:49:04 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-12-12T17:49:11 <kasparnet> avtar: go ahead
2014-12-12T17:50:03 <jhernandez> in any case, I\'m leaving now, I have a real-life social event, so that\'s all for today
2014-12-12T17:50:11 <jhernandez> tomorrow more and better
2014-12-12T17:50:41 <kasparnet> jhernandez: lol - awesome! Thanks so much for your hard work over the last days (weeks, and months) -- enjoy the evening and see you tomorrow
2014-12-12T17:50:55 <jhernandez> kasparnet: see you tomorrow at VASSO\'s HOME!!
2014-12-12T17:51:15 <kasparnet> yup!!!
2014-12-12T17:51:25 <andres_malarres> ;-( now D/node.js ( 6635): 18:50:37.652:  mega chusca{}
2014-12-12T17:51:35 <andres_malarres> updated the stypi as well
2014-12-12T17:51:47 <andres_malarres> did that work on your android jhernandez?
2014-12-12T17:52:03 <andres_malarres> elsa is ***spoiler*** again
2014-12-12T17:52:22 <avtar> kasparnet: i like you because you have a nice face and an even more luminous personality to go along with it. i\'m wondering if you, i, and/or anyone else can spend some time to get a dev environment set up that allows the testing of the preferences server running in production so that we can remove that warning from preferencesServer.txt
2014-12-12T17:53:16 <kasparnet> avtar: haha, I like the compliments and that has convinced me to take on the the task you set out
2014-12-12T17:53:22 <jhernandez> andres_malarres: no, but I\'m wondering what would happen if you put app-specific settings there
2014-12-12T17:53:33 <kasparnet> avtar: Is there a particular setup I should do?
2014-12-12T17:53:35 <jhernandez> (instead of common terms)
2014-12-12T17:53:44 <andres_malarres> bye thanks
2014-12-12T17:53:46 * andres_malarres has left the channel
2014-12-12T17:55:01 <avtar> kasparnet: i\'ll start spending time on something packageable after the jenkins work is done but for now i would grab the couchdb and nodejs packages from fedora\'s repository
2014-12-12T17:55:41 <kasparnet> avtar: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1043
2014-12-12T17:55:45 <kasparnet> ok, I\'ll get to it now
2014-12-12T17:56:55 <avtar> kasparnet: it would be even better if you could do this on a centos 7 vm and use packages from the epel repo instead but if that\'s going to take up too much of your time i can tackle that
2014-12-12T17:57:52 <kasparnet> is epel a package manager for centOS, or what does the "epel repo" involve?
2014-12-12T17:58:34 <kasparnet> and: 64 bit?
2014-12-12T17:58:41 <avtar> kasparnet: it\'s a package repository for rhel derived distributions https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL
2014-12-12T17:58:48 <avtar> yes, 64 bit please
2014-12-12T17:59:24 <kasparnet> avtar: I can do it - but might need your help with a few of the installation stuff
2014-12-12T17:59:41 <avtar> kasparnet: i\'m here and i\'m listening
2014-12-12T18:00:06 <kasparnet> "few of the installation stuff" - No speaka de English, I only do the math
2014-12-12T18:00:13 <kasparnet> ok cool, thanks avtar
2014-12-12T18:01:07 <kasparnet> so in terms of packaging -- looks like there are a few options mostly in terms of window managers -- is gone ok
2014-12-12T18:01:08 <kasparnet> (http://mirrors.dk.telia.net/centos/7.0.1406/isos/x86_64/)
2014-12-12T18:01:13 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2014-12-12T18:02:15 <avtar> kasparnet: i would install vagrant instead of doing a manual installation www.vagrantup.com
2014-12-12T18:02:55 <kasparnet> k
2014-12-12T18:03:05 <kasparnet> ... so fancy
2014-12-12T18:03:06 <avtar> once that\'s installed type: vagrant box add chef/centos-7.0
2014-12-12T18:03:27 <kasparnet> avtar: cool
2014-12-12T18:03:36 <kasparnet> will try and come whining when I fail

2014-12-12T18:05:51 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2014-12-12T18:14:33 <kasparnet> avtar: do then just open the vmdk from /Users/kasper/.vagrant.d/boxes/chef-VAGRANTSLASH-centos-7.0/1.0.0/virtualbox in VB or is there a fancy to do that as well
2014-12-12T18:15:06 <avtar> there\'s always a fancy way
2014-12-12T18:15:39 <kasparnet> haha, ofc
2014-12-12T18:15:49 <avtar> type the following in a directory dedicated to this new vm: vagrant init chef/centos-7.0
2014-12-12T18:16:06 <avtar> it should create a file called Vagrantfile
2014-12-12T18:16:36 <avtar> actually, one sec
2014-12-12T18:16:53 <kasparnet> it has done so, yes
2014-12-12T18:19:09 <avtar> kasparnet: do you have any services running on os x that are using port 8080?
2014-12-12T18:19:36 <kasparnet> not right now -- but infusion tests have a tendency of using that port
2014-12-12T18:19:42 <kasparnet> (and GPII tests in general)
2014-12-12T18:19:49 <avtar> would 8888 be safer?
2014-12-12T18:20:14 <kasparnet> yeah - unless I\'m using the preferences editor .. which uses the 8888 port :)
2014-12-12T18:20:19 <kasparnet> but either one should be ok
2014-12-12T18:25:34 <avtar> kasparnet: http://pastie.org/pastes/9776957/text
2014-12-12T18:25:45 <avtar> please replace the contents of Vagrantfile with that

2014-12-12T15:57:48 <colinclark> Justin_o has all the skillz
2014-12-12T16:04:51 <andres_malarres> well, just if you have some spare time (grin) and want to use it installing android (laughter) it\'ll be very valuable if you test that omnitor1.json is working
2014-12-12T16:05:46 <andres_malarres> i had to do some "manual" grunt tasks in order to build my fireball gpii and i don\'t know if ii broke something in the process
2014-12-12T16:09:01 <jhernandez> sorry, I was afk
2014-12-12T16:12:36 <jhernandez> kasparne_: yeah, I can remember that fluid.model.escapedSetConfig thing
2014-12-12T16:13:14 <jhernandez> Justin_o: yup, but my model seems to not being updated

2014-12-12T16:19:41 <kasparne_> but I\'m not sure how to do this, as doing a PUT request (similar to the get version of testGetCORS) in middlewareTests is working just find without any modifications
2014-12-12T16:19:43 <Bosmon> So what did you mean when you said "the flow for CORS is a bit different when using PUT"

2014-12-12T16:20:25 <andres_malarres> hey Basman Besmen Bismin Bosmon Busmun !!!
2014-12-12T16:20:29 <kasparne_> I was mistaking
2014-12-12T16:20:31 <Bosmon> BOUSMOUN
2014-12-12T16:20:52 <kasparne_> :)
2014-12-12T16:21:15 <kasparne_> anyway - all that is needed is to add more allowed methods in the return header of the OPTIONS request
2014-12-12T16:21:39 <kasparne_> I can definitely test that this is working - by modifying the existing kettle tests
2014-12-12T16:21:54 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - seems reasonable
2014-12-12T16:21:57 <kasparne_> .. but I cant find out how to write a test that fails, as this is a browser thing
2014-12-12T16:21:59 <kasparne_> ok cool
2014-12-12T16:22:02 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - yes
2014-12-12T16:22:08 <kasparne_> I\'ll have a pull request coming up shortly then
2014-12-12T16:22:13 <Bosmon> I had been telling YZEN to write some tests which actually worked
2014-12-12T16:22:15 <Bosmon> Just as he was leaving
2014-12-12T16:22:38 <andres_malarres> talking about tests, my wonderful getHolaMundo broke something for node test\\all-tests.js
2014-12-12T16:23:12 <Bosmon> GETHOLAMUNDDO!
2014-12-12T16:23:12 <andres_malarres> not that this was so much important, but made me wonder how to fix that. It put something like getHolaMundo was not properly registered
2014-12-12T16:23:22 <Bosmon> GET IT!
2014-12-12T16:23:26 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-12-12T16:23:39 <andres_malarres> (let me put the precise example)
2014-12-12T16:23:46 <jhernandez> kasparne_: aka: "el pistolero del norte"
2014-12-12T16:24:13 * kasparne_ is now known as el_pistolero_del
2014-12-12T16:24:22 <andres_malarres> yes, espa\xc3\xb1ol is the first step. our secret goal is to have you speak andal\xc3\xba er idioma del futuro jhernandez
2014-12-12T16:24:27 <Bosmon> el_pistolero_del - here is the thread where I was requesting some proper tests
2014-12-12T16:24:28 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/180
2014-12-12T16:24:47 <andres_malarres> we start with holaMundo, soon you\'ll have kePasaIllo
2014-12-12T16:25:14 <Bosmon> yzen, probably 2 days before he actually quit, provided a means for manually testing the CORS support
2014-12-12T16:25:46 <Bosmon> jhernandez - my question above
2014-12-12T16:25:57 <Bosmon> Did you ACTUALLY remember the fluid.model.escapedSetConfig thing? : P
2014-12-12T16:26:13 <Bosmon> Or did you just think that you could remember it
2014-12-12T16:26:21 <jhernandez> Bosmon: vaguely, but yeah :P
2014-12-12T16:26:31 <colinclark> what\'s the difference?
2014-12-12T16:26:33 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2014-12-12T16:26:38 <Bosmon> Well ok, I can ask a more precise question
2014-12-12T16:26:41 <Bosmon> Did you remember to *DO* it : P
2014-12-12T16:26:46 <andres_malarres> 17:25:53.916:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Object The grade hierarchy of co

2014-12-12T16:28:00 <Bosmon> And - I assume that you\'ve written getHolaMundo in a new file somewhere - what is the location of the file, and is it in a new package?

2014-12-12T16:29:38 <Bosmon> Did you write a new test case, or does thie failure come from one of the existing ones?
2014-12-12T16:29:59 <andres_malarres> and  fluid.defaults("kettle.requests.request.handler.getHolaMundo" inside ContextManager.js
2014-12-12T16:30:33 <andres_malarres> and no, i just was following the github directions to test
2014-12-12T16:33:52 <jhernandez> well, I used escaped[Set/Get]Config when trying to set values like "voices.default.whatever", which had to result in {voices: {default: {whatever: value}}}
2014-12-12T16:34:06 <Bosmon> Hi andres_malarres - could you go to https://code.stypi.com/nnq5inpz and paste in your ContextManager.js there
2014-12-12T16:34:07 <Bosmon> Thanks
2014-12-12T16:34:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez - how did you "use" it - can you paste your code?
2014-12-12T16:34:52 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/orca/orcaSettingsHandler.js#L109-L110
2014-12-12T16:35:45 <Bosmon> jhernandez - ok, I see
2014-12-12T16:35:50 <Bosmon> Well the issue is that you must use it NOW!
2014-12-12T16:36:17 <andres_malarres> https://github.com/malarres/universal/blob/GPII-795/gpii/node_modules/contextManager/src/ContextManager.js#L95-L106
2014-12-12T16:36:35 <Bosmon> Thanks, andres_malarres
2014-12-12T16:36:38 <jhernandez> what I want is to apply in change in {model: {modelEl: { "org.chrome.cloud4chrome" : {whatever: value}}}
2014-12-12T16:36:59 <Bosmon> Checking now
2014-12-12T16:39:36 <Bosmon> Hi andres_malarres - you just need to an an include at line 24 of the file
2014-12-12T16:39:41 <Bosmon> It needs to read:
2014-12-12T16:39:44 <Bosmon> require("flowManager");
2014-12-12T16:40:08 <Bosmon> jhernandez - currently andres_malarres is beating you by several laps in actually pasting his code :)
2014-12-12T16:40:32 <Bosmon> I guess time passes more quickly the further south you get in Spain
2014-12-12T16:40:55 <colinclark> lol
2014-12-12T16:41:01 <colinclark> jhernandez is in Brussels, anyway
2014-12-12T16:41:09 <Bosmon> ah well
2014-12-12T16:41:11 <Bosmon> That explains everything
2014-12-12T16:41:14 <colinclark> presumably about to get on a plane to Athens
2014-12-12T16:41:31 <Bosmon> He no doubt needs to submit a petition in triplicate to the EC in order to allow them to release his code
2014-12-12T16:41:55 <Bosmon> "buried in soft peat for 3 months and recycled as firelighters" &c &c
2014-12-12T16:42:09 <colinclark> lol
2014-12-12T16:42:39 <colinclark> Perhaps that should be my excuse for the terribly slow code review
2014-12-12T16:44:23 <andres_malarres> ahh thanks Bosmon
2014-12-12T16:45:45 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-12-12T16:46:06 <Bosmon> jhernandez - if you would PASTE YOUR CODE, I could HELP YOU TOO!
2014-12-12T16:46:08 <el_pistolero_del> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/17
2014-12-12T16:46:18 * el_pistolero_del is now known as kasparnet
2014-12-12T16:46:22 <colinclark> zomg
2014-12-12T16:46:28 <colinclark> we have a pistolero
2014-12-12T16:46:32 <kasparnet> not anymore
2014-12-12T16:46:44 <andres_malarres> (5:46:06 PM) el_pistolero_del: Bosmon   --> weird to read that
2014-12-12T16:46:45 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-12-12T16:46:53 <kasparnet> it was supposed to be "el_pistolero_del_norte"
2014-12-12T16:47:01 <kasparnet> but IRC screwed me over
2014-12-12T16:47:07 <colinclark> man, i killed myself laughing when kasparnet threatened everyone with a death ray yesterday
2014-12-12T16:47:24 <kasparnet> haha - yeah, I wasn\'t sure whether it was appropriate
2014-12-12T16:47:30 <colinclark> it really is a unique superpower you have
2014-12-12T16:47:36 <kasparnet> but it worked - they\'ve both gotten back to me today :D
2014-12-12T16:47:36 <Bosmon> kasparnet, that looks fine
2014-12-12T16:47:40 <Bosmon> I\'ll merge it in a sec
2014-12-12T16:47:43 <colinclark> I\'m quite certain you can get away with it, kasparnet
2014-12-12T16:47:59 <colinclark> if I tried a move like that, jhernandez would pull me aside to talk about body language
2014-12-12T16:48:09 <kasparnet> hahaha
2014-12-12T16:48:21 <colinclark> "death rays don\'t make friends, colinclark"
2014-12-12T16:48:32 <kasparnet> lol
2014-12-12T16:48:49 <kasparnet> awesome, thanks so much Bosmon
2014-12-12T16:54:37 * kasparnet has quit
2014-12-12T16:55:25 * michelled has quit
2014-12-12T16:57:32 <jhernandez> Bosmon: basically, this is the scenario
2014-12-12T16:57:34 <jhernandez> https://code.stypi.com/cg9gdfdv
2014-12-12T16:58:18 <Bosmon> jhernandez - that code looks fine
2014-12-12T16:58:45 <colinclark> but what about the dots, doc?
2014-12-12T16:58:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - they work fine too
2014-12-12T16:59:04 <jhernandez> yeah, it should, but I\'m getting an error
2014-12-12T16:59:06 <Bosmon> No need for EL parsing when you are using the array form of an EL expression
2014-12-12T16:59:13 <Bosmon> jhernandez - what error are you getting!
2014-12-12T16:59:30 <colinclark> aha, thanks Bosmon
2014-12-12T16:59:52 <jhernandez> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Object browserSettings,org.chrome.cloud4chrome has no method \'charAt\'
2014-12-12T17:00:08 <Bosmon> ok
2014-12-12T17:00:23 <Bosmon> Looks like there may be a separate bug in the applier, in that it is attempting to reparse the expression
2014-12-12T17:00:37 <Bosmon> You should make sure that it is constructed with these options which we used in the orcaSettingsHandler:
2014-12-12T17:00:37 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/orca/orcaSettingsHandler.js#L87
2014-12-12T17:00:41 <andres_malarres> Bosmon I tried require("flowManager");  fluid.require("flowManager"); and fluid.require("flowManager",fm); with no success
2014-12-12T17:02:08 <Bosmon> andres_malarres - the tests run fine for me with that change
2014-12-12T17:02:14 <Bosmon> Could you commit your modified version and I will test it
2014-12-12T17:04:52 <andres_malarres> oh nevermind. the plain require worked. not a good idea to have two instances of notepad++ in half screen mode when you have the chat also in half screen mode :-P
2014-12-12T17:04:59 <andres_malarres> thanks
2014-12-12T17:05:02 <Bosmon> cool there we go
2014-12-12T17:05:16 <Bosmon> Now for VVERNANDDEZ problem
2014-12-12T17:05:45 <andres_malarres> (i\'m still having the original problem that put me here)
2014-12-12T17:11:10 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I\'ve added some alternative code to your STYPI
2014-12-12T17:11:16 <Bosmon> What is your original problem, andres_malarres?
2014-12-12T17:11:35 <andres_malarres> the fireball branch and anode

b'2014-12-12T00:00:10 <avtar> i may have come up with a workaround for that screen reader issue as well but i\'ll aim to test my theory before our call
2014-12-12T00:00:29 <avtar> we may or may not have to sacrifice github webhooks in exchange :/
2014-12-12T00:01:59 <Bosmon> I guess I don\'t understand why that configuration doesn\'t explode with a file not found before it gets any further
2014-12-12T00:02:12 <Bosmon> But jhernandez, avtar - the "modern" driver for the architecture is the file gpii.js
2014-12-12T00:02:26 <Bosmon> I just fixed one of the readmes but it\'s clear that lots of them are out of date
2014-12-12T00:02:41 <Bosmon> If you use that entry point + node_env + config path, it will ensure to load all the code first
2014-12-12T00:02:46 <jhernandez> yeah, I was aware of that

2014-12-12T12:02:05 <jhernandez> kasparnet: Bosmon hey, how the hell can I use the same instance of my model in the flowmanager and in the settings handler?
2014-12-12T12:02:20 <Bosmon> jhernandez - just the way you already did
2014-12-12T12:02:27 <Bosmon> You will just have to stick it in a "well-known global path"
2014-12-12T12:03:16 <kasparnet> hey jhernandez, Bosmon
2014-12-12T12:04:18 <jhernandez> yes
2014-12-12T12:04:23 <kasparnet> Bosmon: Are we generally sticking somethign like this on the session?
2014-12-12T12:04:37 <kasparnet> which I guess is living in the lifecycle manager
2014-12-12T12:04:43 <kasparnet> or am i mixing up things?
2014-12-12T12:04:46 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, as you know, settings handlers don\'t participate in any of the IoC machinery
2014-12-12T12:04:49 <Bosmon> yes, you are mixing up things!
2014-12-12T12:04:58 <Bosmon> Wittgenstein, you always MIX THINGS UP!
2014-12-12T12:05:43 <jhernandez> but, now I added my model as a new component into the flowmanager in order to keep the same model in the flowManager and in the settings handler itself
2014-12-12T12:07:47 <jhernandez> the problem is when the settings handler is calling my .get/.set from the lifecyclee manager, I don\'t know how to reach the flowmanager\'s current instance of my model
2014-12-12T12:08:38 <jhernandez> of course, I\'m probably doing it VVRONGGG!!!
2014-12-12T12:16:15 <Bosmon> jhernandez - it\'s fine - we expect just a single flowmanager instance in any realistic deployment of the GPII - so you can just stick that component reference (the one holding the model for the settings handlers) into a global
2014-12-12T12:16:20 <Bosmon> Flag it as a risk, and we\'ll watch it
2014-12-12T12:20:41 <jhernandez> ok

2014-12-12T14:16:15 <kasparne_> Bosmon7
2014-12-12T14:16:15 <kasparne_> ... sigh
2014-12-12T14:16:39 <kasparne_> so I\'m just looking at the PCP/flowmanager integration
2014-12-12T14:16:44 <kasparne_> and am making some progress
2014-12-12T14:17:10 <kasparne_> I finally hit the CORS issue I was talking about at one of the arch meetings
2014-12-12T14:17:42 <kasparne_> So it *seems* that the first POST (on creating a new user) call is being made correctly and that a new user in indeed created
2014-12-12T14:17:55 <kasparne_> but when I try to update the preferences, I\'m getting this error:
2014-12-12T14:18:04 <kasparne_> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8081/preferences/60cb88f8-1c5e-4e67-a69f-41a8a0f217b2. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.
2014-12-12T14:18:31 <kasparne_> (taken from the firebug window of the PMT)
2014-12-12T14:19:26 <kasparne_> I\'m puzzled that this only happens with the PUT request, and so far haven\'t been able to find anything in the source that could be the cause of this
2014-12-12T14:20:01 <kasparne_> .. but just to confirm - this would be an issue with the serverside (preference server) as opposed to the PMT itself (given that the URL is correct and all that) .. is that correct
2014-12-12T14:20:09 <kasparne_> Justin_o: not sure if you know anything about this ^
2014-12-12T14:21:23 <Justin_o> kasparne_: i believe your assumption is correct, that it is an issue with the server.
2014-12-12T14:22:21 <Justin_o> kasparne_: cors needs to do a pre-flight request using an option request so maybe this needs to be setup and you also have to open up access, which may only be happening for some requests at the moment
2014-12-12T14:22:43 <Justin_o> request types

2014-12-12T15:21:16 <kasparne_> Bosmon, Justin_o: ok, so learned a bit more ...  it seems the flow for CORS is a bit different when using PUT than for POST/GET .. which is a bit scary, in that it might mean it\'s a bigger issue than expected
2014-12-12T15:30:16 <kasparne_> Bosmon: yay - figured it out
2014-12-12T15:30:36 <kasparne_> seems it was never allowed to do CORS PUT requests according to the kettle framework
2014-12-12T15:31:20 <kasparne_> Justin_o: So the good news is that I now got the PMT running with the fireball branch
2014-12-12T15:31:22 <kasparne_> the bad news
2014-12-12T15:31:56 <kasparne_> is that (1) It requires and update to kettle and (2) my branch is mixed in with all Alex\' work to get the PCP displaying messages, etc

2014-12-12T15:38:35 <jhernandez> kasparne_: awesome!
2014-12-12T15:38:37 <jhernandez> :)
2014-12-12T15:38:55 <jhernandez> hey guys, I have a fluid related question
2014-12-12T15:39:18 <colinclark> fire away
2014-12-12T15:39:41 <jhernandez> when applying changes into a model, and if my model is as follows
2014-12-12T15:39:59 * michelled joined the channel
2014-12-12T15:39:59 * Sepideh has quit
2014-12-12T15:40:22 <jhernandez> model: modelEl: { "I.love.fluid" : value}}
2014-12-12T15:40:44 <jhernandez> how can I appy a change to "I.love.fluid"?
2014-12-12T15:41:18 <colinclark> you should be able to escape the dots
2014-12-12T15:41:33 <colinclark> Justin_o is experienced with this kinds of things, I think
2014-12-12T15:41:33 <jhernandez> that.applier.change(["modelEl", "I.love.fluid"], newValue)
2014-12-12T15:42:00 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s my impression, but I\'m not sure how to escape them
2014-12-12T15:42:05 <jhernandez> \\
2014-12-12T15:42:07 <jhernandez> \\\\
2014-12-12T15:42:21 <colinclark> applier.change("modelEl.i\\.love\\.fluid", newValue) should work, I believe
2014-12-12T15:42:27 <Justin_o> jhernandez: did the array for you mentioned here not work?
2014-12-12T15:42:57 <jhernandez> Justin_o: that\'s it, I\'m getting a beautiful error
2014-12-12T15:43:01 <jhernandez> :)
2014-12-12T15:43:20 <kasparne_> Justin_o, Bosmon: FYI http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/KETTLE-25
2014-12-12T15:44:18 <jhernandez> Justin_o: colinclark Object browserSettings,org.chrome.cloud4chrome has no method \'charAt\' - so it\'s definetly a matter of escaping the dots, but how?
2014-12-12T15:47:57 <colinclark> it\'s a good question, jhernandez
2014-12-12T15:48:06 <colinclark> I\'m doing a test to see what I can figure out
2014-12-12T15:48:42 <Justin_o> jhernandez: did you try using "\\\\
2014-12-12T15:48:44 <Justin_o> "

2014-12-12T15:50:10 <andres_malarres> hi :-)
2014-12-12T15:51:25 <colinclark> hello, andres_malarres
2014-12-12T15:51:29 <andres_malarres> i\'m trying to buffer overrun jhernandez \'s brain by posting on every channel
2014-12-12T15:51:34 <andres_malarres> :-P
2014-12-12T15:51:57 * yzen joined the channel
2014-12-12T15:52:05 <colinclark> lol
2014-12-12T15:52:10 <andres_malarres> just kidding, i see he\'s very occupied now and I need some help. have any of you installed the new fireball branch on android?
2014-12-12T15:52:43 <andres_malarres> yes colinclark is an idea borrowed from the evil kasparnet laser method (tm)
2014-12-12T15:52:43 <kasparne_> jhernandez, colinclark, Justin_o: I seem to remember an issue with escaped paths when using fluid.get and fluid.set
2014-12-12T15:53:04 <colinclark> kasparne_: Cool, what do you remember?
2014-12-12T15:53:19 <colinclark> Since I can\'t, in my naive way, get any form of escaping to work with my tests
2014-12-12T15:53:19 <kasparne_> and us creating a function to handle that  fluid.set(toTransform, preference, true, fluid.model.escapedSetConfig);
2014-12-12T15:53:39 <kasparne_> but not entirely sure how that relates to the applier
2014-12-12T15:53:46 <kasparne_> I can probably even find a JIRA somewhere
2014-12-12T15:53:48 <kasparne_> hold on
2014-12-12T15:53:49 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2014-12-12T15:54:53 <Justin_o> jhernandez: here\'s a simple jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/emn2eodf/
2014-12-12T15:54:59 <Justin_o> the array form should work
2014-12-12T15:55:13 <kasparne_> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-114
2014-12-12T15:55:38 <kasparne_> andres_malarres: sorry - I haven\'t tried installing it in android yet
2014-12-12T15:56:17 <Justin_o> jhernandez: just realized you are using the change applier.. i\'ll try to modify my example to use that instead.
