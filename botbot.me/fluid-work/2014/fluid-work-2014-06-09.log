2014-06-09T13:04:33 <Justin_o> jhung: i guess starting a wiki page would be good
2014-06-09T13:04:46 <jhung> Under infusion?
2014-06-09T13:04:50 <Justin_o> jhung: i don\'t know if simon started anything yet
2014-06-09T13:04:57 <jhung> i\'ll check
2014-06-09T13:05:19 <Justin_o> jhung:  cool, if you don\'t find anything, i guess something in the main fluid space in the wiki would be fine
2014-06-09T13:05:31 <jhung> ok Justin_o
2014-06-09T13:05:32 <Justin_o> we\'ll probably have to do some reorganizing as we move the docs out

2014-06-09T14:45:43 <anastasiac> hi, mancoolgunda
2014-06-09T14:46:12 <mancoolgunda> anastasiac: Is it possible to create a datagrid using Infusion framework?
2014-06-09T14:46:31 <mancoolgunda> something of the sort, http://appendgrid.apphb.com/Demo
2014-06-09T14:47:30 <anastasiac> ah, yes. It\'s certainly possible. We created one for the CSpace user interface. You can see it if you access the demo here: http://collectionspace.org/
2014-06-09T14:47:42 <anastasiac> although, mancoolgunda, that was written a while ago
2014-06-09T14:47:48 <anastasiac> but it\'s certainly possible
2014-06-09T14:49:14 <anastasiac> mancoulgunda, I believe the source code for the "repeatable" functionality of the table is here: https://github.com/collectionspace/ui/blob/master/src/main/webapp/defaults/js/Repeatable.js

2014-06-09T14:50:46 <anastasiac> mancoolgunda, I\'m not as familiar with the collectionspace code as, say, yzen_ or ank are. They might be able to provide more insights.

2014-06-09T18:28:34 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m slowly trying to isolate what is causing Docpad to crash. It seems there\'s something peculiar with FluidRequests.js. I\'m looking through that file now to see if there\'s anything obvious that may be causing a problem.

2014-06-09T18:31:13 <jhung> Unclear. I\'m trying to figure out a good way to debug docpad now Justin_o

2014-06-09T19:07:48 <jhung> Justin_o: any browser?
2014-06-09T19:08:09 <Justin_o> jhung: sorry.. forgot to mention.. chrome
2014-06-09T19:08:18 <jhung> ok Justin_o
2014-06-09T19:08:38 <jhung> All 34 tests pass Justin_o
2014-06-09T19:08:56 <Justin_o> jhung: are you using your mac or pc?
2014-06-09T19:09:12 <Justin_o> jhung: can you try this one as well http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/framework-tests/preferences/html/UIEnhancer-test.html
2014-06-09T19:10:08 <jhung> mac Justin_o
2014-06-09T19:10:25 <jhung> All 11 tests pass Justin_o
2014-06-09T19:10:53 <Justin_o> jhung: this is so strange.. there are consistent failures on mine.. and i\'ve even deleted the chrome and reinstalled it :(
2014-06-09T19:11:35 <jhung> strange. Not sure why Justin_o
2014-06-09T19:12:04 <Justin_o> michelled: can you please take a look at a couple of pull requests for me https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/524 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/525
2014-06-09T19:12:30 <Justin_o> jhung: yah.. i have no idea.. they are working for cindyli too, so it could just be something with my setup
2014-06-09T19:12:58 <michelled> I\'ll put them on my list Justin_o
2014-06-09T19:13:15 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks
2014-06-09T19:18:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: i can\'t figure out why those tests are only failing on my machine.. i tried running them locally (off my machine instead of the build site) and they all passed.. maybe you can just close it as "cannot reproduce"

2014-06-09T19:23:10 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, i\'m on the first one: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5418
2014-06-09T19:23:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: great thanks... maybe i\'ll start testing those other ones with 1.4
2014-06-09T19:23:54 <cindyli> sounds good, Justin_o
