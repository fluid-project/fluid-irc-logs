b'2014-07-21T20:31:42 <Bosmon> I don\'t quite remember, I\'m sorry
2014-07-21T20:31:55 <Bosmon> Can I read about it quickly somewhere to remind myself?
2014-07-21T20:32:14 <cindyli> the first step is to tranform arrays to booleans and the 2nd step is from booleans to end target model like {"flashing": "unknown"}
2014-07-21T20:32:28 <Bosmon> Oh
2014-07-21T20:32:31 <Bosmon> I am starting to remember
2014-07-21T20:32:37 <Bosmon> The boolean transform is just for rendering purposes?
2014-07-21T20:33:12 <cindyli> from booleans to end models? yes, just for rendering
2014-07-21T20:33:15 <Bosmon> It seems to me that the transforms are connected up with the wrong geometry
2014-07-21T20:33:19 <Bosmon> The booleans should be at the end
2014-07-21T20:33:23 <Bosmon> These transform 1-1 to the arrays
2014-07-21T20:33:29 <Bosmon> And then the arrays transform to the end model
2014-07-21T20:33:36 <Bosmon> that is, the target model
2014-07-21T20:33:50 <Bosmon> Connecting the booleans to the end target model directly seems the source of all the problems
2014-07-21T20:35:24 <cindyli> ok, let me write down what\'s need for the example of this flashing tranformation, then we discuss
2014-07-21T20:38:50 <cindyli> Bosmon:
2014-07-21T20:38:51 <cindyli> source central model:
2014-07-21T20:38:51 <cindyli> {
2014-07-21T20:38:52 <cindyli> accessibilityHazard: ["flashing"]
2014-07-21T20:38:52 <cindyli> }
2014-07-21T20:38:52 <cindyli> the "flashing" value could be "noflashing" or nothing (undefined)
2014-07-21T20:38:53 <cindyli> 3 cases for the target model:
2014-07-21T20:38:53 <cindyli> 1. array has "flashing" -> {"flashing": "flashing"}
2014-07-21T20:38:54 <cindyli> 2. array has "noflashing" -> {"flashing": "noflashing"}
2014-07-21T20:38:54 <cindyli> 3. array has nothing -> {"flashing": "unknown"}
2014-07-21T20:40:07 <cindyli> are you suggesting to have target model in those 3 cases:
2014-07-21T20:40:11 <cindyli> "flashing": true
2014-07-21T20:40:11 <cindyli> or
2014-07-21T20:40:11 <cindyli> "flashing": false
2014-07-21T20:40:11 <cindyli> or
2014-07-21T20:40:11 <cindyli> "flashing": undefined
2014-07-21T20:47:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m leaving soon. Can you drop me an email about your thoughts or we can continue our discussion tomorrow.

2014-07-21T13:34:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking into the position of the arrow when their is a collision with the dialog and the edge of the window..
2014-07-21T13:36:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: last week we had been talking about creating specific style declarations for each of the buttons to set where the arrow will be positioned. However, I i\'m thinking that it\'s problematic for when we start having dialogs under the preferences. Since we don\'t know where they\'ll show up, we won\'t know how to position the dialog precisely
2014-07-21T13:37:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: what do you think about separating the dialog and the arrow into separate elements that are hidden and shown at the same time or something like that?
2014-07-21T13:37:55 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2014-07-21T13:44:01 <cindyli> Justin_o: how would separating the dialog and the arrow help with the relative position of the arrow to the dialog?
2014-07-21T13:44:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: we\'d position it relative to the button instead of the dialog
2014-07-21T13:44:54 <Justin_o> so the dialog would slide around below it, intend of moving the dialog and the arrow
2014-07-21T13:44:57 <cindyli> oh, i see, good idea
2014-07-21T13:45:32 <Justin_o> okay.. i\'ll see what i can do to reimplement it.. but i\'ll basically be starting over :(
2014-07-21T13:45:38 <cindyli> Justin_o: btw, i pushed more into FLOE-194 to close the dialog when clicking inside UIO iframe
2014-07-21T13:46:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: great thanks.. i\'ll pull that down

2014-07-21T17:15:13 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking through the bindDialog.js code. is containerIdentifier really needed
2014-07-21T17:16:21 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think it can take a jQuery Element, so we should be able to pass in the component container there
2014-07-21T17:17:23 <cindyli> Justin_o: can it? i will try, or you\'ve tried?
2014-07-21T17:18:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: i haven\'t tried it yet, but i can experiment.. i\'ll probably have to re-work this component a bit to get the styling changes i need implemented
2014-07-21T17:19:31 <cindyli> feel free to make change to it, Justin_o
2014-07-21T17:19:33 <cindyli> trying too
2014-07-21T17:19:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-07-21T17:19:44 <cindyli> np
2014-07-21T17:23:06 <cindyli> yes, the jquery element works. thanks, Justin_o. making change now. will let u know once it\'s pushed up
2014-07-21T17:23:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-07-21T17:27:52 <cindyli> Justin_o: pushed

2014-07-21T19:19:11 * michelled joined the channel
2014-07-21T19:19:19 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon
2014-07-21T19:19:20 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if you saw the two pulls I issued for your reports
2014-07-21T19:19:37 <Bosmon> The first one can be merged immediately since it just consists of an extra test
2014-07-21T19:19:52 <cindyli> yes, i did, Bosmon, in the middle of testing the 2nd one
2014-07-21T19:19:59 <Bosmon> I\'ll circulate a mail about the second one today, but it should be enough for you to carry on testing until you run into the next issue :)
2014-07-21T19:20:19 <cindyli> and, the first one works great with the metadata demo
2014-07-21T19:24:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: if the 2nd one needs more polish up to get into the master, can I file another jira to improve the related part in the metadata tool so we can continue reviewing this pull request and get it into the master, since Justin_o and I are getting the metadata feedback tool into the same repo, maintaining this pending pull request will be more difficult
2014-07-21T19:25:00 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - michelled and I are just talking about this now
2014-07-21T19:25:15 <cindyli> cool
2014-07-21T20:06:32 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon, for the 2nd pull request, there are 2 cases that the transformation result would be {"flashing": "unknown"}. I wonder which source would this result be inverted to?
2014-07-21T20:07:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m having a problem using the 2nd case of valueMapper in the model relay: the backward transformation is not happening when the target model is changed
2014-07-21T20:07:59 <cindyli> sending a test case for it

2014-07-21T20:19:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks
2014-07-21T20:19:23 <Bosmon> I expected something of that kind would happen
2014-07-21T20:19:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - what inversion behaviour would you like?
2014-07-21T20:19:49 <Bosmon> In general as the valueMapper is set up, an ambiguous match will invert to the default value
2014-07-21T20:19:59 <Bosmon> But this may not be what you want in this case
2014-07-21T20:20:49 <cindyli> i think the more sensible inverted value is falsy
2014-07-21T20:21:00 <Bosmon> ?
2014-07-21T20:21:02 <cindyli> Bosmon: 2 false values. ju
2014-07-21T20:21:04 <Bosmon> Which falsy value
2014-07-21T20:21:22 <cindyli> {flashing: false, noflashing: false}
2014-07-21T20:21:47 <Bosmon> cindyli - what UI could update the far side of the result to "unknown"?
2014-07-21T20:23:03 <cindyli> let me get the demo link
2014-07-21T20:23:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/html/index.html, select "climate change impact"
2014-07-21T20:24:23 <cindyli> in "video details" panel, first section, the 3 radio buttons, is where "unknown" is set
2014-07-21T20:25:59 * anvk has quit
2014-07-21T20:29:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - where is the other model controlled from?
2014-07-21T20:29:19 <Bosmon> The one which contains the sets of boolean flags
2014-07-21T20:29:29 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon
2014-07-21T20:29:36 <Bosmon> cindyli - where
2014-07-21T20:29:42 <cindyli> in the code?
2014-07-21T20:29:50 <Bosmon> Well, is there a UI for both ends?
2014-07-21T20:29:52 <Bosmon> Or only one end
2014-07-21T20:29:59 <cindyli> there\'s only one end
2014-07-21T20:30:05 <cindyli> has a UI
2014-07-21T20:30:07 <Bosmon> Peculiar
2014-07-21T20:30:17 <Bosmon> So why is the transform not designed the other way round?
2014-07-21T20:30:39 <cindyli> the reason of this is we\'d like to have a central model that makes more sense to integrators
2014-07-21T20:31:11 <Bosmon> Does a model that might contain {flashing: false, noflashing: false} potentially make more sense? : P
2014-07-21T20:31:13 <cindyli> so the central model looks something like {accessibilityMode: ["audio"]}
2014-07-21T20:31:21 <cindyli> of course not
2014-07-21T20:31:35 <cindyli> rmb we have 2 steps of tranformation?
