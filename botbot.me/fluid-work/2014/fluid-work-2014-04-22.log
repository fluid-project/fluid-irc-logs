2014-04-22T14:13:01 <anastasiac> good morning, colinclark. Any thoughts on Jutta\'s request for an updated news item on the Floe site? are we going to try to make that change? Do we have a suggestion for a news item?
2014-04-22T14:13:29 <colinclark> Yes, we should definitely update the news on the site
2014-04-22T14:13:39 <colinclark> jessm: Do you have any thoughts on stories we can add?
2014-04-22T14:13:51 <anastasiac> jessm just left for coffee
2014-04-22T14:13:57 <colinclark> ok, she\xe2\x80\x99ll be back
2014-04-22T14:14:03 <colinclark> Perhaps we can update on a few of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve done recently
2014-04-22T14:14:33 <colinclark> including the workshop jessm and michelled gave at the DLM conference
2014-04-22T14:14:44 <colinclark> Perhaps the workshop you and michelled gave, anastasiac
2014-04-22T14:15:02 <colinclark> The OpenEd and the CNX conference
2014-04-22T14:15:13 <colinclark> Progress on the PMT/PCP effort
2014-04-22T14:15:25 <colinclark> Joanna\xe2\x80\x99s new designs for searching in Floe
2014-04-22T14:15:28 <colinclark> there\xe2\x80\x99s lots there
2014-04-22T14:15:45 <anastasiac> yeah, those are great ideas.
2014-04-22T14:22:01 <jessm> i\xe2\x80\x99m back
2014-04-22T14:22:20 <jessm> yes, anastasiac i sent you an email a while ago about updating preso events \xe2\x80\x94 lemme dig it up
2014-04-22T14:22:47 <jessm> it included DML, OpenEd, and CNX also, PhET from colinclark

2014-04-22T14:51:06 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac - I submitted a pull request to fix some styling issues with the overviewPanel. It makes the text more legible which may be important for this afternoon\'s demo.
2014-04-22T14:51:25 <anastasiac> jhung, is this a pull request to infusion?
2014-04-22T14:51:37 * jhung has quit
2014-04-22T14:51:55 <anastasiac> redeploying that is a bit more complicated than the floe site, we\'d better check with Avtar

2014-04-22T14:54:07 <anastasiac> jessm, was there one paper accepted at HCI, or more?
2014-04-22T14:59:47 <anastasiac> jessm, colinclark: first pass at a news item for the floesite: http://172.16.2.126:8888/Floe/sites/floeproject.org/news/2014-04-14-Floe-presentations.html
2014-04-22T14:59:53 <anastasiac> let me know what you think of the format, etc
2014-04-22T14:59:58 <anastasiac> any suggestions
2014-04-22T15:00:45 <colinclark> I suspect this IP address is behind NAT, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it
2014-04-22T15:02:31 <colinclark> but I trust jessm\xe2\x80\x99s judgement
2014-04-22T15:02:33 <colinclark> or send me a screenshot

2014-04-22T15:06:14 <jessm> anastasiac: we have an ungodly number of papers at HCII \xe2\x80\x94 lemme find the list
2014-04-22T15:06:29 <anastasiac> oh, cool! that will be much more impressive :-)
2014-04-22T15:11:49 * kasparnet has quit
2014-04-22T15:13:00 <jessm> anastasiac: so, colinclark and i just had a quick chat\xe2\x80\xa6 i wonder if we can create individual news items for presos and papers that are short \xe2\x80\x94 like announcements. and then create a few news items that describe some of our work, as colinclark said, a few paragraphs about what the metadata editing components are for (why they\xe2\x80\x99re importnat) and another post of a few paragraphs about our metadata search designs
2014-04-22T15:15:21 <anastasiac> ok, I can work something like that up, jessm
2014-04-22T15:15:46 <jessm> anastasiac: awesome. i can come see anytime - just ping

2014-04-22T16:04:06 <anastasiac> jeez, jessm, is there anyone else besides us presenting at HCII??
2014-04-22T16:04:43 <jessm> anastasiac: a few :)
2014-04-22T16:05:04 <jessm> anastasiac: HCII is actually a conglomeration of a few conferences
2014-04-22T16:05:16 <jessm> http://www.hcii2014.org/
2014-04-22T16:08:04 <anastasiac> jessm, do you want to come look at what I\'ve got so far, or should I give you a link?

2014-04-22T16:38:52 <colinclark> Minor thing...
2014-04-22T16:39:03 <colinclark> for the \xe2\x80\x9cFloe at HCII\xe2\x80\x9d can you list this one as the first bullet point? An Introduction to the Floe Project
2014-04-22T16:39:26 <anastasiac> done
2014-04-22T16:39:54 <colinclark> cool
2014-04-22T16:39:59 <jhung> jessm: I just ran ILDH through IE8, IE9, and IE11 - fonts look fine. Did some UI transformations too and it behaved as expected. Was there something more specific I should be looking for?
2014-04-22T16:40:17 <jhung> FF and Chrome looked fine too
2014-04-22T16:40:27 <jessm> jhung: not sure \xe2\x80\x94 maybe it was just readability
2014-04-22T16:40:37 <jessm> jhung: do you mind checking with janr?
2014-04-22T16:40:44 <jhung> sure
2014-04-22T16:41:06 <anastasiac> ok, colinclark, once I hear back from jessm, I\'ll issue a pull request for these changes.

2014-04-22T16:41:32 <anastasiac> colinclark, you probably didn\'t notice: vjoanna worked the cloud image back into the page. Do you think it works?
2014-04-22T16:42:20 <colinclark> I noticed :)
2014-04-22T16:42:35 <jessm> jhung: just chatting with colinclark \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a thin font issue. perhaps we put in a bug for making the font different on windows?
2014-04-22T16:42:35 <colinclark> And I think it looks great
2014-04-22T16:43:03 <colinclark> That\xe2\x80\x99s my guess, anyway
2014-04-22T16:43:14 <colinclark> Font rendering on Windows leaves a lot to be desired
2014-04-22T16:43:23 <colinclark> and I remember we had this problem with the inclusivedesign.ca a few years ago
2014-04-22T16:43:35 <colinclark> with a nice thin font that was really bad on Windows
2014-04-22T16:43:38 <jhung> jessm: yes I can see how the default font can be a problem.
2014-04-22T16:44:32 <jhung> jessm: I can see what I can do - is this something that needs to be fixed right away?
2014-04-22T16:46:16 <anastasiac> jessm, any final thoughts on the floe site?   http://172.16.2.126:8888/Floe/sites/floeproject.org/  Check a) latest news item at bottom of home page, b) \'read more\' link, c) news archive
2014-04-22T16:47:58 <jessm> jhung: not needed right away at all!

2014-04-22T16:48:46 * yzen joined the channel
2014-04-22T16:49:42 <jessm> anastasiac: we should mention the floe-team\xe2\x80\x99s participation in schema.org \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise it reads like we\xe2\x80\x99re re-posting someone else\xe2\x80\x99s news item

2014-04-22T16:52:47 <anastasiac> updated now
2014-04-22T16:53:20 <jhung> thanks jessm. There\'s a fix by removing the font-weight. I\'ll file a jira and make note of that.
2014-04-22T16:53:46 <jessm> jhung: thank you jhung!

2014-04-22T16:55:21 <jessm> anastasiac: i think the conference is called HCI \xe2\x80\x94 as you\xe2\x80\x99ve put in the text and i\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling it HCII \xe2\x80\x94 maybe let\xe2\x80\x99s stick to HCI?
2014-04-22T16:55:49 <anastasiac> jessm, you mean get rid of "international"?
2014-04-22T16:56:03 <anastasiac> oh, no
2014-04-22T16:56:05 <anastasiac> gotcha
2014-04-22T16:56:07 <anastasiac> I missed that

2014-04-22T16:57:10 <jessm> anastasiac: colin and crew and dana and I
2014-04-22T16:58:18 <jessm> anastasiac: in metadata editing components there\xe2\x80\x99s something funny with \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x94 ducing\xe2\x80\x9d do you see that?
2014-04-22T16:58:59 <jessm> anastasiac: one more\xe2\x80\xa6 for harnessing the open web we did a presentation and design activity \xe2\x80\x94 it was super cool actually
