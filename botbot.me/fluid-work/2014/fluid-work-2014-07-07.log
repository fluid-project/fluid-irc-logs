2014-07-07T16:10:33 <michelled> hey, I tried pinging in Skype, but I just realized you aren\'t actually on Skype :)
2014-07-07T16:10:37 <michelled> yes, I\'m ready
2014-07-07T16:10:51 <colinclark_> oh yes
2014-07-07T16:11:04 <colinclark_> i have to figure out why skype always shows me as online
2014-07-07T16:16:18 <jhernand1z> colinclark_: perhaps because you are always online? :P
2014-07-07T16:16:25 <colinclark_> lol
2014-07-07T16:16:27 <colinclark_> :P
2014-07-07T16:16:33 <jhernand1z> well
2014-07-07T16:16:37 <jhernand1z> partially kidding ...
2014-07-07T16:16:45 <colinclark_> michelled: THE commit
2014-07-07T16:16:46 <colinclark_> i believe
2014-07-07T16:16:48 <colinclark_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/195114939abf45ff25d19ff86e4197182a660633
2014-07-07T16:16:50 <colinclark_> THE commit
2014-07-07T16:16:54 <jhernand1z> are you using skype on your phone/tablet?
2014-07-07T16:20:51 <colinclark_> jhernand1z: Yeah, that\'s my guess
2014-07-07T16:21:01 <colinclark_> I\'d bet that I\'ve been logged in on the iPad ever since San Diego

2014-07-07T16:48:48 <Justin_o> danaayotte: for pmt/pcp for adjusters that have the + and - steppers around a value. should the + and - symbols be keyboard navigable or do you expect the user to interact with the value directly
2014-07-07T16:50:28 * colinclark_ has quit
2014-07-07T16:51:11 <danaayotte> Justin_o: both
2014-07-07T16:51:25 <danaayotte> user can use up/down arrows to increase/decrease value or
2014-07-07T16:51:26 <Justin_o> danaayotte: so you\'d want them to be buttons
2014-07-07T16:51:30 <danaayotte> yes
2014-07-07T16:51:36 <danaayotte> it is also a text entry field
2014-07-07T16:51:41 <danaayotte> they can enter a value directly
2014-07-07T16:52:14 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i guess i mean the "-" and "+" that a mouse user would click on.. do you want a keyboard only user to be able to hit the space or enter key to use them?

2014-07-07T16:52:24 * colinclark_ has quit
2014-07-07T16:52:44 <danaayotte> yes.  I was thinking - navigate to them with tab, control them with arrow keys
2014-07-07T16:53:12 <danaayotte> what were you thinking space/enter would do?
2014-07-07T16:55:24 <danaayotte> Justin_o: I guess if arrow keys are also used for scrolling then space/enter would enter user into the adjuster field, right?
2014-07-07T16:55:38 <danaayotte> and then they could use arrow keys to control +/-

2014-07-07T17:52:06 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i think we may not be on the same page, perhaps it will be better to talk about this in person so we can look at the adjusters as we talk about it.

2014-07-07T19:18:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: can this be close http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-907
2014-07-07T19:19:43 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I guess so. It might still be a nice thing to do, but pretty darn low on the priority scale
2014-07-07T19:21:02 <Justin_o> anastasiac: we can leave it as minor. i was wondering if it had been taken care of by the a11y page you had written
2014-07-07T19:21:06 <Justin_o> i forget what it was called though
2014-07-07T19:21:24 <anastasiac> I had a look at that page, and it doesn\'t really go into as much depth as this JIRA was thinking of, I believe
2014-07-07T19:23:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, thanks.. i\'ll leave it open
2014-07-07T19:23:40 <Justin_o> i\'ll just remove the affects version
