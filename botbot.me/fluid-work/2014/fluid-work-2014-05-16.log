2014-05-16T13:13:59 <cindyli> good morning, jhung
2014-05-16T13:15:17 <jhung> hey cindyli
2014-05-16T13:15:48 <cindyli> jhung: the styling of the overview panel in the metadata demo looks a bit weird. I wonder if it's related to the recent styling change. do you have time to skype so i can share my screen?
2014-05-16T13:16:04 <jhung> sure

2014-05-16T13:27:54 <cindyli> jhung: adjusting font size doesn't seem to help to uncover the close button. can you help to take a look. the branch is pushed up - https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/tree/FLOE-171
2014-05-16T13:28:11 <jhung> Sure cindyli
2014-05-16T13:28:18 <cindyli> thanks, jhung

2014-05-16T15:03:12 <jhung> cindyli: I have a fix, but I'm now fixing some other styling issues with the overviewpanel in Metadata Demo. I'll push up soon.
2014-05-16T15:04:06 <cindyli> cool. thanks, jhung
2014-05-16T15:24:09 <jhung> cindyli: I pushed up changes to my FLOE-171 branch. Unfortunately there's a styling bug that needs to be fixed in the OverviewPanel. I'm thinking of putting a temporary fix in Metadata demo since it's only obvious in Metadata and file a jira to fix it later?
2014-05-16T15:24:52 <cindyli> sounds good, jhung
2014-05-16T15:26:22 <cindyli> jhung: let me know when your FLOE-171 branch is ready to be merged in.
2014-05-16T15:26:25 <cindyli> thanks
2014-05-16T15:26:42 <jhung> sure. It'll be a second...
2014-05-16T15:46:07 <jhung> cindyli: I pushed up my changes.
2014-05-16T15:46:33 <cindyli> nice. pulling in
2014-05-16T15:56:29 <cindyli> jhung: it looks great. thanks for fixing it.
2014-05-16T15:56:52 <jhung> cindyli: great and np.
