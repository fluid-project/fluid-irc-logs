b'2014-05-06T19:31:29 <Bosmon> Usually we prefer a script block if we and the integrator are the same person
2014-05-06T19:31:37 <Bosmon> But in this case I think there are grounds for saying we are not
2014-05-06T19:31:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, agreed.. that was one reason i didn\'t want to do it, since i\'d have to go update all of the pages
2014-05-06T19:32:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: makes sense
2014-05-06T19:32:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m planning on putting the $(document).ready call just around this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/demos/shared/js/overviewWrapper.js#L26-L35
2014-05-06T19:32:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - as I never tire of saying, "future versions of the Renderer will make this kind of problem go away" : P
2014-05-06T19:32:29 <Justin_o> so that the template fetching can start in the head
2014-05-06T19:32:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  yeah :)
2014-05-06T19:39:54 <cindyli> Bosmon: In metadata demo, i have a video panel component that renders a group of 3 radio buttons. Each click on one radio button triggers a model change on the same model path.
2014-05-06T19:40:19 <cindyli> If I use this component as a standalone, each model change is fired with a correct value
2014-05-06T19:41:56 <cindyli> This component needs to be a sub-component of a tree and its model is a target from a modelRelay using our conditional transform
2014-05-06T19:42:35 <cindyli> I wrote a invertConfiguration function to invert this conditional transform
2014-05-06T19:43:57 <cindyli> however, once the invertConfiguration is in place, the value from the modelChanged becomes incorrect
2014-05-06T19:44:26 <cindyli> I know there might be something wrong in my invertConfiguration function
2014-05-06T19:45:05 <cindyli> my questions are: 1, how would the inversion function affect the source model value?
2014-05-06T19:48:31 <cindyli> 2. I guess I need to trace into the inverted rule, let me do another search on where the inverted rule is used in the framework
2014-05-06T19:50:43 <cindyli> Also, I\'m not sure if the inverted rule is the place to trace in, since the things went wrong at the source model value, it should have not got to the point where the inverted rule should be applied.
2014-05-06T19:51:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: when you have time could you please look at my pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/512
2014-05-06T19:51:51 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2014-05-06T19:52:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2014-05-06T15:44:26 <anastasiac> simonjb, I hope to pick up a page or two of docs for conversion today. What\'s the process you\'re using to convert to Markdown? Do you have a converter, or are you doing it by hand?
2014-05-06T15:45:43 <simonjb> anastasiac: by hand
2014-05-06T15:51:59 <jhernandez> clown: yesterday I opened a pull request
2014-05-06T15:52:28 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/246 and https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49
2014-05-06T15:52:43 <jhernandez> (in fact, two of them)
2014-05-06T15:52:45 <jhernandez> :)
2014-05-06T15:52:53 <clown> hey jhernandez.
2014-05-06T15:52:57 * clown reading
2014-05-06T15:53:10 <clown> okay, I didn\'t see any email about them.
2014-05-06T15:53:13 <clown> Should I have?
2014-05-06T15:53:49 <jhernandez> unless you\'re subscribed to github\'s notifications about GPII, nope
2014-05-06T15:54:19 <jhernandez> now I gotta leave, but I\'ll be back in an hour or so
2014-05-06T15:54:52 <clown> okay.  I\'ll see if I can pull them into my local repository.
2014-05-06T15:55:00 <clown> thanks, jhernandez.
2014-05-06T15:55:03 <jhernandez> cool

2014-05-06T16:06:07 <simonjb> Justin_o: when you were converting the ChangeApplier API to Markdown, what did you do for previewing? push to github and view it there? or did you set up something to preview locally?
2014-05-06T16:09:24 <Justin_o> simonjb: good question. I have the "Markdown Editing" plugin installed in my sublime text. It gives me sort of a preview as I edit for things like bolding, italics, and code blocks..
2014-05-06T16:09:43 <Justin_o> I also checked the generated output in github after the fact
2014-05-06T16:09:52 <simonjb> anastasiac: ^
2014-05-06T16:10:10 <simonjb> I think I\'ll try installing marked locally
2014-05-06T16:10:15 <anastasiac> thanks
2014-05-06T16:10:30 <simonjb> it\'s installable with npm
2014-05-06T16:10:34 <Justin_o> simonjb: I also started off by using a test branch in github to see what that would look like. the markdown editing in through githubs own interface is pretty good and it does support previewing like a wiki would.
2014-05-06T16:10:48 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ^
2014-05-06T16:11:08 <Justin_o> simonjb: https://www.npmjs.org/package/marked
2014-05-06T16:11:14 <Justin_o> oh you found it
2014-05-06T16:11:15 <Justin_o> :)
2014-05-06T16:11:24 <simonjb> Justin_o: I didn\'t know you could edit directly on github
2014-05-06T16:11:33 <Justin_o> simonjb: l\'d be interested in knowing how well that works
2014-05-06T16:11:57 <simonjb> we\'ll need to figure out the best workflow(s)
2014-05-06T16:12:03 <Justin_o> simonjb: yah.. github has gotten pretty good at that.. you can manage branches, even create them, and create files and edit them all from github\'s website
2014-05-06T16:12:09 <Justin_o> simonjb: yes, for sure
2014-05-06T16:12:43 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o: I\'ll try both github remotely and marked locally
2014-05-06T16:13:52 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: big news today atom.io is open source http://blog.atom.io/2014/05/06/atom-is-now-open-source.html
2014-05-06T16:14:33 <Justin_o> simonjb, anastasiac: if you want to try atom.io it has built in markdown previewing, and should be the same as provided on github. I think it only supports mac at the moment though.
2014-05-06T16:16:47 <colinclark> Justin_o: This is really great news
2014-05-06T16:17:01 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99ve been using it since I was accepted into the beta program, and enjoying it a lot
2014-05-06T16:17:09 <colinclark> once they release Windows and Linux clients, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be amazing
2014-05-06T16:18:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, i\'m really happy they open sourced it. I wasn\'t quite sure that they would. I haven\'t used it too much yet. It had been crashing on me a lot, but I\'ll try it out again, now that it\'s probably more stable.
2014-05-06T16:18:48 <colinclark> I found for some reason that it stopped updating itself for a bit
2014-05-06T16:18:57 <colinclark> so I downloaded a new copy from the website and it seems to be much better now
2014-05-06T16:19:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s good to hear, i just downloaded the latest one they have up on their site. Maybe I\'ll try it out for those doc conversions.
2014-05-06T16:19:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: how was the jshint integration for it?
2014-05-06T16:28:23 <simonjb> Justin_o, anastasiac: editing markdown directly on github is pretty good
2014-05-06T16:29:30 <simonjb> quite like editing on a wiki with preview

2014-05-06T17:04:53 <simonjb> anastasiac: I see that you have taken the ChangeApplier page -- awesome
2014-05-06T17:05:08 <anastasiac> It\'s short :-)
2014-05-06T17:05:50 <simonjb> when Justin_o converted the ChangeApplierAPI, he left the links in place, even though in the short term they will be broken
2014-05-06T17:06:20 <simonjb> I think this is a good approach and I think we should continue
2014-05-06T17:06:59 <simonjb> I will add a new JIRA task to check through broken links before 1.5 goes live
2014-05-06T17:07:42 <simonjb> we can then see where we are at and tidy up accordingly
2014-05-06T17:07:56 <simonjb> anastasiac: thoughts?
2014-05-06T17:11:37 <anastasiac> simonjb, I agree that links should be there; they remind of where we want links. I think that for now, we might want to implement them so that they will automatically become correct if the relevant page gets added to the repo - does that make sense?
2014-05-06T17:12:00 <simonjb> anastasiac: yes, definitely
2014-05-06T17:12:06 <anastasiac> meaning create broken links that point to where we expect a page to be
2014-05-06T17:12:14 <anastasiac> knowing our filename conventions, etc
2014-05-06T17:12:15 <simonjb> agreed
2014-05-06T17:12:25 <anastasiac> ok, great
2014-05-06T17:14:05 <anastasiac> btw, the open source atom is only good on 10.8 and up (for those of us who haven\'t yet upgraded)
2014-05-06T17:14:13 <anastasiac> I\'ve found this: http://www.markdownviewer.com/

2014-05-06T17:47:29 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. The one when you click on a link and coming back the panel is empty. There\'s a Jira for that.
2014-05-06T17:48:09 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, that\'s the one, can you send me a link to that.. i just ran into it in IE8, but on the initial page load
2014-05-06T17:48:17 <Justin_o> jhung: also i think i found out what\'s causing it

2014-05-06T17:56:33 <Justin_o> jhung: I think we should fix this, and have upgraded it to critical for the 1.5 release
2014-05-06T17:56:45 <Justin_o> jhung: do you remember who worked on this part of the code?
2014-05-06T17:57:11 <jhung> probably simonjb Justin_o
2014-05-06T17:58:24 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. thanks.. i\'m not sure he\'ll have time to look at it.. maybe someone else will have to pick it up.
2014-05-06T18:05:33 <jhung> Justin_o: sounds reasonable. Is it on the iteration page?
2014-05-06T18:06:02 <Justin_o> jhung: i think it should show up in the jira list automatically
2014-05-06T18:06:10 <jhung> ok
2014-05-06T18:37:38 <clown> jhernandez:  quick update:  I\'ve managed to git the latest linux "device-reporter-draft2" branch, compile the nodepackagekitaddon, and run the unit tests.

2014-05-06T19:20:25 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2014-05-06T19:20:31 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I don\'t have a fix for your problem yet
2014-05-06T19:20:34 <Bosmon> But I am thinking hard about it
2014-05-06T19:21:53 * michelled joined the channel
2014-05-06T19:22:13 <cindyli> not a problem, Bosmon. thanks for thinking hard about it. :) just wanna let you I added a comment on the jira you created yesterday http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5361, regarding another issue with model listeners
2014-05-06T19:22:26 <cindyli> "let you know"
2014-05-06T19:27:58 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: I have an implementation question for you guys, if you have time
2014-05-06T19:28:02 <Bosmon> Thanks cindyli - I think this is an aspect of the same issue
2014-05-06T19:28:07 <Bosmon> So I will make sure to deal with it at the same time
2014-05-06T19:28:19 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2014-05-06T19:28:40 <colinclark> sure, Justin_o
2014-05-06T19:29:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, so I think i tracked down what was causing FLUID-5338 and you can see the details in my comment http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5338#comment-24542
2014-05-06T19:29:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o, yes
2014-05-06T19:29:37 <Justin_o> I\'m trying to figure out the best way to tackle this. here\'s the code https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/demos/shared/js/overviewWrapper.js#L24-L36
2014-05-06T19:29:37 <Bosmon> Your explanation seems reasonable
2014-05-06T19:29:43 <Justin_o> :) thanks
2014-05-06T19:29:57 <Bosmon> This is the kind of issue we ran into in CSpace a lot
2014-05-06T19:30:11 <Bosmon> In various situations, notification of AJAX requests on IE can be synchronous
2014-05-06T19:30:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, did you have a particular approach for fixing it?
2014-05-06T19:30:19 <Bosmon> If it thinks it can find the request body in its cache
2014-05-06T19:30:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think your solution of wrapping the application in document.ready seems ok
2014-05-06T19:30:37 <Bosmon> Do you see a problem with it?
2014-05-06T19:31:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: nope.. i was just wondering if that would be better or using a script block after the element in the body
2014-05-06T19:31:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the problem with the script block is that it places a maintenance burden on the person using the markup
