2014-01-17T14:13:39 <kasparne_> Justin_o_: yup
2014-01-17T14:13:57 <Justin_o_> kasparne_: sorry i had to run out on our conversation yesterday.. also you seem to be missing a letter in your name
2014-01-17T14:14:13 * kasparne_ is now known as kasparnet
2014-01-17T14:14:15 <kasparnet> thanks
2014-01-17T14:14:18 <Justin_o_> :)
2014-01-17T14:14:36 <kasparnet> and np re ysterday
2014-01-17T14:14:49 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: so i have two questions for you.. i\'ll start with the easy one.. do you have a special plugin in jira to do those @ references to jira users?
2014-01-17T14:15:01 <Justin_o_> thanks
2014-01-17T14:15:33 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: nope - just doing @<start typing name> works
2014-01-17T14:15:46 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: but it\'s extremely convenient
2014-01-17T14:16:18 * amilchev joined the channel
2014-01-17T14:16:19 <Justin_o_> yes it is.. and it does look like it works in ours too.. thanks
2014-01-17T14:16:32 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: okay.. harder question.. so this is from yesterday..
2014-01-17T14:16:58 <Justin_o_> basically i want to transform an array of objects into a single value based on some condition across all of the objects.
2014-01-17T14:18:30 <Justin_o_> so say i have { original: [{val: true}, {val: false}]} and i want {new: "all true"} or {new: "all false"} or {new: "has a true"} sort of like testing && or || against all the val keys in the array of objects
2014-01-17T14:18:49 <Justin_o_> is there a way to do this now.. or will i have to write my own transformation for this?
2014-01-17T14:22:33 <kasparnet> that WAS a harder question
2014-01-17T14:22:36 * anvk joined the channel
2014-01-17T14:22:36 <kasparnet> ... just thinking
2014-01-17T14:23:18 <Justin_o_> no problem :)
2014-01-17T14:24:50 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: so, from what I can tell, there is no immediately obvious way of doing this, no
2014-01-17T14:25:22 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-01-17T14:27:44 <kasparnet> a slightly hacky approach, that might at least get you part of the way, could be to use the array to object traansform: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions#Changing_an_object_into_an_object_.28fluid.transforms.objectToArray.29
2014-01-17T14:28:56 * Jess_ joined the channel
2014-01-17T14:29:07 <kasparnet> so basically, you\'d have something like that transform with:
2014-01-17T14:29:13 <kasparnet> {
2014-01-17T14:29:13 <kasparnet> transform: {
2014-01-17T14:29:13 <kasparnet> type: "fluid.transforms.arrayToObject",
2014-01-17T14:29:14 <kasparnet> inputPath: "original",
2014-01-17T14:29:16 <kasparnet> key: "val"
2014-01-17T14:29:18 <kasparnet> }
2014-01-17T14:29:20 <kasparnet> }
2014-01-17T14:29:35 <kasparnet> but this wasn\'t exactly what that transform was meant for, so I\'m not sure if it\'d actually work
2014-01-17T14:30:22 <kasparnet> but if you\'re lucky, that\'d leave you with an object with one/two keys (true/false) depending on which was present
2014-01-17T14:30:53 <kasparnet> and then use a condition transform to sort out the remaining "all true", "all false", etc part
2014-01-17T14:31:41 <kasparnet> ... but as said, this is both a bit hacky, and I\'m not sure it\'ll work.. alternatively, you could, as you say, write your own proper transform
2014-01-17T14:31:45 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: ^
2014-01-17T14:32:56 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: thanks for the help.. i\'ll see if i can get that to work

2014-01-17T19:32:15 <michelled> Bosmon: we had a chance to have a quick check in about the 1.5 release yesterday after the call
2014-01-17T19:33:53 <michelled> Bosmon: we are thinking that once all the Infusion pull requests are in, we will do a final list of what we will do for the release and start testing
2014-01-17T19:34:15 <michelled> hopefully next week - although that will mean some corralling of pull requests :)
2014-01-17T19:36:24 <Bosmon> michelled - that will be great :)
2014-01-17T19:36:34 <Bosmon> There are a few littler ones you could pick off quite quickly if you had the time
2014-01-17T19:36:40 <Bosmon> For example the IE8/IE10 one ....
2014-01-17T19:37:03 <michelled> ah, and now I have access to a lovely MOONBOOK PRO to test on :)

2014-01-17T20:24:09 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2014-01-17T20:24:11 <Bosmon> How are you doing?
2014-01-17T20:24:41 <cindyli> doing ok. have a question about overwriting a model expander
2014-01-17T20:24:53 <cindyli> here\'s the code with the expander: https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/FLOE-116/src/js/panel.js#L36-L41
2014-01-17T20:25:42 <cindyli> if i pass in a static model as an option, i\'d like to have this expander being overwritten, but it\'s not happening, Bosmon
2014-01-17T20:26:05 <Bosmon> Yes, unfortunately it doesn\'t
2014-01-17T20:26:13 <Bosmon> It may work better if the static model appears in a grade
2014-01-17T20:28:02 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Bosmon

2014-01-17T21:20:27 <colinclark> Hey michelled, Justin_o_ and/or Bosmon, I have a non-work-related git question if you guys have a few minutes
2014-01-17T21:20:41 <Bosmon> Hey!
2014-01-17T21:20:43 <Bosmon> colinclark
2014-01-17T21:20:49 <colinclark> hi
2014-01-17T21:21:41 <colinclark> I\'m about to embark on the process of merging two different Git repositories together
2014-01-17T21:21:48 <colinclark> ideally I\'d like to retain the history
2014-01-17T21:21:53 <Bosmon> oh dear
2014-01-17T21:21:57 <colinclark> have any of you done anything like this before?
2014-01-17T21:23:41 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure there\'s any evidence that this is even possible
2014-01-17T21:25:10 <colinclark> I found this blog post: http://gbayer.com/development/moving-files-from-one-git-repository-to-another-preserving-history/
2014-01-17T21:25:19 <colinclark> but it seems suspicious to me
2014-01-17T21:25:33 <colinclark> But I\'ll have to read through the various posts it links to
2014-01-17T21:26:02 <colinclark> I guess the alternative is just to move the files and then retain the old repository for "legal" reasons
2014-01-17T21:27:11 <Bosmon> I guess it seems plausible
2014-01-17T21:27:15 <Bosmon> What seems suspicious about it to you?
2014-01-17T21:27:28 <colinclark> I don\'t know
2014-01-17T21:27:32 <colinclark> I guess I\'m suspicious of myself
2014-01-17T21:27:44 <colinclark> I really have leaned excessively on you guys for virtually all Git-related advice
2014-01-17T21:28:03 <Bosmon> In practice git has never really bit us terribly badly
2014-01-17T21:28:43 <colinclark> okay
2014-01-17T21:28:51 <colinclark> I\'ll do a bit more research and then, well, go for it
2014-01-17T21:28:54 <Bosmon> It does seem simpler than one would think
2014-01-17T21:29:07 <Bosmon> "On line 3, you\xe2\x80\x99ll create a remote connection to repository A as a branch in repository B."
2014-01-17T21:29:13 <Bosmon> I didn\'t think this was possible
2014-01-17T21:29:25 <Bosmon> I had assumed the "git religion" was that every linked repository must share a common ancestor
