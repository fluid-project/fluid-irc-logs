b'2014-01-13T22:55:18 <kasparnet> colinclark: but something that isn\'t likely to explode things, I\'m ok with
2014-01-13T22:55:23 <colinclark> it\'s a one-liner that updates kettle
2014-01-13T22:55:28 <colinclark> so theoretically, it could be huge
2014-01-13T22:55:31 <colinclark> in practice, it\'s simple
2014-01-13T22:55:37 <colinclark> I tested that npm installs correctly
2014-01-13T22:55:45 <kasparnet> colinclark: cool - go for it
2014-01-13T22:55:51 <colinclark> done
2014-01-13T22:55:55 <colinclark> so I think you just need to blast your node_modules and rerun npm install again
2014-01-13T22:56:00 <kasparnet> colinclark: I\'ll send a crazy axe murderer after you if things explode
2014-01-13T22:56:07 <colinclark> send it after yzen
2014-01-13T22:56:15 <colinclark> he made the code changes ;)
2014-01-13T22:56:47 <kasparnet> avtar: I\'ll be available from your 2 am to your noon-2pm\'ish .. depending on how long our meeting runs
2014-01-13T22:56:58 <kasparnet> ok - will do that colinclark :)
2014-01-13T22:57:12 <colinclark> Let me know how it goes, kasparnet, with this
2014-01-13T22:57:21 <colinclark> I\'m feeling like death at the moment, but I\'m going to try to chip away at the slow demo
2014-01-13T22:57:28 <colinclark> I will send you an email with a branch of universal
2014-01-13T22:57:59 <colinclark> and basically I\'ll just need you to key in at the right moment--I\'ll tell you when
2014-01-13T22:58:12 <colinclark> and then to show the reviewers the logs as I talk about each phase of the flow
2014-01-13T22:58:18 * danaayotte_ has quit
2014-01-13T23:00:38 <avtar> kasparnet: ok. could you test something for me before you crash?
2014-01-13T23:02:40 <kasparnet> sure
2014-01-13T23:02:50 <kasparnet> could you test something for me before you crash?
2014-01-13T23:02:53 <kasparnet> :)
2014-01-13T23:02:58 <avtar> sure
2014-01-13T23:03:01 <avtar> me first
2014-01-13T23:03:09 <kasparnet> avtar: this url http://flowmanager.gpii.net/mobileaccessibility1/settings/%7B%22OS%22:%7B%22id%22:%22android%22%7D,%22solutions%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22es.codefactory.android.app.ma%22%7D%5D%7D
2014-01-13T23:03:11 <avtar> are you on the network that you will be using for the demo?
2014-01-13T23:03:22 <kasparnet> I am avtar
2014-01-13T23:03:48 <kasparnet> avtar: oh crap
2014-01-13T23:03:51 <kasparnet> no I\'m not
2014-01-13T23:03:54 <avtar> and are you using os x or linux?
2014-01-13T23:03:58 <kasparnet> linux
2014-01-13T23:03:58 <avtar> ok
2014-01-13T23:04:10 <kasparnet> haha - fuck .. I keep giving you the wrong answers
2014-01-13T23:04:15 <kasparnet> os x, I\'m on
2014-01-13T23:04:27 <avtar> but not on the potentially locked down network?
2014-01-13T23:05:42 <kasparnet> avtar: it\'s a hotel, so it could be locked down ... though I doubt it
2014-01-13T23:06:00 <kasparnet> unfortunately we wont be able to try out the network we\'re demoing until we\'re actually demoing
2014-01-13T23:06:21 <avtar> that doesn\'t sound ideal then
2014-01-13T23:06:44 <avtar> i just sent you an invitation to a top secret channel
2014-01-13T23:07:08 <avtar> have you received it?
2014-01-13T23:07:08 <kasparnet> that sounds so insanely exciting
2014-01-13T23:07:23 * colinclark jealous
2014-01-13T23:07:38 <avtar> it doesn\'t look like you\'ve received it
2014-01-13T23:07:46 <avtar> please join #fluid-ops
2014-01-13T23:11:51 * anastasiac has quit

2014-01-13T23:18:49 <avtar> kasparnet: what should i doing with that url besides clicking it furiously?
2014-01-13T23:19:12 <kasparnet> well - first you should conclude that it just gives you an empty pair of curly brackets
2014-01-13T23:19:20 <avtar> it does
2014-01-13T23:19:33 <avtar> i have concluded that much
2014-01-13T23:19:58 <kasparnet> when trying the same on my local instance of the cloudbased flowmanager, I get something very different - namely the expected NP set
2014-01-13T23:21:20 <kasparnet> could you double check that there is a mobile accessibility entry in the android.json solution registry (grep -i codefactory <GPII install dir>/node_modules/universal/testData/solutions/android.json)
2014-01-13T23:21:50 <kasparnet> cause if it\'s there, I find it odd that the two instances are giving different results
2014-01-13T23:22:23 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2014-01-13T23:23:37 <avtar> kasparnet: two things
2014-01-13T23:24:10 <avtar> 1) ./node_modules/universal/testData/solutions/android.json does not exist
2014-01-13T23:24:20 <avtar> 2) /node_modules/universal does not exist either
2014-01-13T23:24:36 <avtar> err ./node_modules/universal
2014-01-13T23:25:38 <kasparnet> oh sorry - I\'m forgetting we\'re on a non-windows or linux install
2014-01-13T23:25:47 <kasparnet> (or rather in flowmanager only mode)
2014-01-13T23:25:59 <kasparnet> so just testData/solutions/android.json
2014-01-13T23:26:44 <kasparnet> avtar: I\'m sorry for writing wrong stuff to you - my head is clearly not working to well atm
2014-01-13T23:27:03 <avtar> grep -i codefactory testData/solutions/android.json
2014-01-13T23:27:04 <avtar> "id": "es.codefactory.android.app.ma",
2014-01-13T23:27:04 <avtar> "applications.es\\\\.codefactory\\\\.android\\\\.app\\\\.ma.id"
2014-01-13T23:27:39 <kasparnet> goddammit computers! Why wont you work
2014-01-13T23:27:46 <kasparnet> http://xkcd.com/
2014-01-13T23:28:23 <kasparnet> thanks avtar
2014-01-13T23:29:13 <colinclark> i wish I was good at grep
2014-01-13T23:29:44 <colinclark> i\'d write whole applications with grep and find
2014-01-13T23:29:46 <colinclark> and sed and awk
2014-01-13T23:30:16 <colinclark> and because of this, they\'d make me the UX lead for GNOME
2014-01-13T23:38:19 <kasparnet> my skills extend to "grep -i" .. with the occasional "-n" thrown into the mix ... but it\'s amazing how far you get with just that
2014-01-13T23:39:37 <avtar> -R will change you as an individual
2014-01-13T23:39:54 <avtar> as will -v
2014-01-13T23:41:44 <avtar> kasparnet: i\'m going to take a break and go find a frosty beverage and some dinner
2014-01-13T23:42:03 <avtar> i\'ll be online tonight so leave me a message in the channel or email if i should test or redeploy anything

b'2014-01-13T20:07:42 <Bosmon> yes!
2014-01-13T20:07:42 <avtar> yup
2014-01-13T20:07:45 <Bosmon> SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT WORK!
2014-01-13T20:07:54 <avtar> i had to change the ownership of that directory to nodejs:tomcat
2014-01-13T20:08:16 <yzen> Justin_o_: so it looks like it is actually intentional
2014-01-13T20:08:30 <colinclark> avtar: Is it possible that it\'s failing for this reason?
2014-01-13T20:08:38 <colinclark> Do you want to give my branch a shot?
2014-01-13T20:08:39 <yzen> Justin_o_: i m looking at the code and it looks like stop is called when loging in if the user js already active
2014-01-13T20:08:42 <avtar> sure
2014-01-13T20:08:44 <yzen> but then the start should be fired
2014-01-13T20:08:58 <yzen> it does not actually start again right, Justin_o_ ?
2014-01-13T20:09:23 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/RuleBased_MatchMaker/tree/review2
2014-01-13T20:10:00 <colinclark> Here\'s the STMM, which I did verify was returning a valid payload...
2014-01-13T20:10:03 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker1/tree/review2
2014-01-13T20:10:59 <colinclark> michelled: It sounds like there\'s still a lot of work in terms of plugging away with the PCP
2014-01-13T20:11:09 <colinclark> my impression, though, is that we will need to get Yura\'s Kettle fix "in"
2014-01-13T20:11:15 <colinclark> at some point before the end of the day
2014-01-13T20:11:26 <colinclark> where "in" just means that the review2 universal is depending on it
2014-01-13T20:11:49 <colinclark> I can imagine there are a lot of outstanding questions related to CORS that will require us to study how we\'re handling it in Kettle\'s master
2014-01-13T20:12:19 <colinclark> So it may be the case that we link review2 universal to Yura\'s fork?
2014-01-13T20:12:26 <colinclark> What are your thoughts?
2014-01-13T20:12:46 <michelled> as long as yzen knows that the demo is happening off his branch, that\'s ok.
2014-01-13T20:12:59 <michelled> I prefer to have everything in the project repo
2014-01-13T20:13:13 <michelled> because we are all used to thinking of that in a more careful manner than our own forks
2014-01-13T20:13:47 <michelled> colinclark: if you and Bosmon feel that the kettle pul should go into master, perhaps we should put a different branch to the project repo
2014-01-13T20:13:55 <michelled> should not
2014-01-13T20:13:58 * jessm has quit
2014-01-13T20:14:18 <michelled> wow, I\'m really confusing there :)
2014-01-13T20:14:27 <colinclark> no, I understood what you meant
2014-01-13T20:14:46 <colinclark> My impression is just that it\'s super unclear what exactly we need and are doing when it comes to sending CORS headers with Kettle
2014-01-13T20:15:05 <colinclark> we certainly could create a "cors-websocket" branch in Kettle\'s project repo
2014-01-13T20:15:25 <colinclark> Bosmon: Is that acceptable to you, assuming we find some time to chat with yzen a bit about it?
2014-01-13T20:15:41 <yzen> colinclark: I\'m free whenever
2014-01-13T20:16:00 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T20:16:07 <colinclark> I need to do a bit of writing for about 15 minutes
2014-01-13T20:16:21 <colinclark> maybe at 3:30 EST/1:30 MST?
2014-01-13T20:16:30 <avtar> colinclark: rbmm is up
2014-01-13T20:16:35 <colinclark> oh wow
2014-01-13T20:16:40 <colinclark> let me umm, probe it
2014-01-13T20:16:48 <michelled> hehe
2014-01-13T20:16:55 <avtar> yours was b0rking probably because of this https://github.com/colinbdclark/RuleBased_MatchMaker/blob/review2/configs/development.json#L12
2014-01-13T20:17:08 <avtar> you would have to start node with sudo
2014-01-13T20:17:18 <colinclark> ah yes
2014-01-13T20:17:24 <Bosmon> Oops
2014-01-13T20:17:30 <Bosmon> I just pushed it
2014-01-13T20:17:35 <colinclark> oh, ok
2014-01-13T20:17:38 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-13T20:17:49 <colinclark> we should still chat briefly about it
2014-01-13T20:17:56 <Bosmon> Certainly we should
2014-01-13T20:18:12 <colinclark> michelled: problem solved, assuming we don\'t have any long-term security issues that pop up ;)
2014-01-13T20:18:26 <colinclark> In the long run, we\'ll need to study CORS very closely
2014-01-13T20:18:38 <Bosmon> I am sure that there will be security issues
2014-01-13T20:18:45 <colinclark> does 1330 MST work for you, Bosmon?
2014-01-13T20:18:50 <Bosmon> Yes, that will be fine
2014-01-13T20:18:52 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T20:18:55 <michelled> :)
2014-01-13T20:19:14 <yzen> yes there will be security issues
2014-01-13T20:23:55 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-13T20:24:29 <avtar> stmm a la review2 is online
2014-01-13T20:31:26 <colinclark> avtar: RBMM is working nicely at rbmm.gpii.net
2014-01-13T20:32:01 <colinclark> STMM isn\'t looking awesome
2014-01-13T20:32:30 <colinclark> no wait
2014-01-13T20:32:32 <colinclark> I\'m not looking awesome
2014-01-13T20:32:50 <colinclark> STMM is looking awesome, avtar
2014-01-13T20:33:28 <avtar> sweet
2014-01-13T20:37:11 <Justin_o_> yzen: you mean will it start again if i login a third time?
2014-01-13T20:37:19 <Bosmon> hahaha
2014-01-13T20:37:37 <Bosmon> "kindly hit it with a hammer for the third time and it will work" : p
2014-01-13T20:37:45 <yzen> Justin_o_: ideally user should be logged in once
2014-01-13T20:38:25 <yzen> the reason it fails on the second, my guess, is because orca is not shut down yet when we are starting it again
2014-01-13T20:39:05 <yzen> making the settings part async is a task we already have but it requires some work

2014-01-13T20:48:17 <yzen> yes
2014-01-13T20:49:29 <Justin_o_> yzen: so did some more testing and it acts like a toggle
2014-01-13T20:50:05 <yzen> ya i see the logic there as such : start -> if started -> stop -> start

2014-01-13T22:35:02 <michelled> how was dinner?
2014-01-13T22:35:05 <kasparnet> good!
2014-01-13T22:35:28 <kasparnet> but long :)
2014-01-13T22:35:44 <michelled> I generally think that makes for a good dinner ;)
2014-01-13T22:35:49 <kasparnet> hehe yeah
2014-01-13T22:36:25 <kasparnet> would you happen to know if avtar updated the servers?
2014-01-13T22:36:38 <michelled> he did indeed :)
2014-01-13T22:36:53 <avtar> i think it was a few hours ago
2014-01-13T22:37:02 <avtar> kasparnet ^
2014-01-13T22:37:09 <avtar> how long are you planning on being online?
2014-01-13T22:37:10 <michelled> the only thing left is for colinclark to make a pull request to universal that updates the kettle dependency to the latest.
2014-01-13T22:37:22 <colinclark> oh yes, I can do that now
2014-01-13T22:37:22 <colinclark> sorry
2014-01-13T22:37:26 <colinclark> i\'m getting a little fuzzy
2014-01-13T22:37:33 <colinclark> still have to do this demo
2014-01-13T22:38:02 <kasparnet> avtar: I\'m planning to stay on for another hour or so -- which in practice probably means I\'ll stay on for a couple of hours
2014-01-13T22:38:10 <kasparnet> but i have Javi keeping me in company
2014-01-13T22:38:50 <kasparnet> avtar: thanks avtar
2014-01-13T22:38:54 <michelled> kasparnet: did you see the email from Justin_o_?
2014-01-13T22:39:07 <kasparnet> does this include flowmanager.gpii.net?
2014-01-13T22:39:30 <avtar> kasparnet: no
2014-01-13T22:39:38 <avtar> just rbmm and stmm
2014-01-13T22:39:50 <kasparnet> avtar: would it be much work to do that one as well?
2014-01-13T22:39:59 <avtar> no
2014-01-13T22:40:00 <avtar> one sec
2014-01-13T22:40:48 <avtar> kasparnet: no changes to package.json eh?
2014-01-13T22:41:16 <kasparnet> nope - it\'s just the solution registry I\'m interested in
2014-01-13T22:42:57 * sgithens has quit
2014-01-13T22:43:16 <colinclark> I need to make a change to package.json for that repo
2014-01-13T22:43:26 <colinclark> Though it will have no effect on the cloud-based flow manager
2014-01-13T22:43:42 <kasparnet> colinclark: could we just have the flowmanager be slightly outdated?
2014-01-13T22:43:52 <colinclark> yes, that\'s fine
2014-01-13T22:43:56 <kasparnet> cool
2014-01-13T22:44:47 <kasparnet> avtar: so I guess we\'re good to go on that with no package.json mods
2014-01-13T22:46:06 <avtar> kasparnet: donesies
2014-01-13T22:46:15 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-13T22:46:43 <colinclark> kasparnet: Are you okay with me pushing this change somewhat blindly to review2 and you can do a quick sanity test?
2014-01-13T22:46:50 <colinclark> i.e. that the system still works?
2014-01-13T22:47:49 <colinclark> it\'s the change that allows the PCP to communicate with the Flow Manager
2014-01-13T22:49:25 <michelled> kasparnet, colinclark: do you need anything more from me tonight?
2014-01-13T22:50:53 <colinclark> I don\'t
2014-01-13T22:51:07 <colinclark> as long as kasparnet is comfortable with what he needs to get the PCP/PMT running, we should be good
2014-01-13T22:51:13 <colinclark> and the demos are in his capable hands
2014-01-13T22:51:30 <avtar> kasparnet: what\'s your availability like tomorrow morning?
2014-01-13T22:51:39 <avtar> tomorrow morning EST
2014-01-13T22:54:38 <kasparnet> michelled: me neither
2014-01-13T22:54:41 <kasparnet> thanks a lot
2014-01-13T22:55:04 <kasparnet> colinclark: no - I\'m fine with that - unless it\'s a major change
'

b'2014-01-13T19:00:31 <colinclark> I want to give kasparnet enough time to be able to test it thoroughly, so our window of opportunity is here now
2014-01-13T19:00:43 <Bosmon> oh
2014-01-13T19:00:45 <colinclark> I\'m just making some sauerkraut eggs and then I\'m free to chat
2014-01-13T19:00:51 <Bosmon> You mean "next steps" as in "this afternoon" .......
2014-01-13T19:07:42 * yzen has quit
2014-01-13T19:09:37 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-13T19:09:49 * sgithens has quit
2014-01-13T19:20:11 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-01-13T19:20:48 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-01-13T19:22:58 <michelled> colinclark: back now - yes, let\'s get the online services updated now
2014-01-13T19:23:06 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T19:23:17 <colinclark> I guess the first thing to do is confirm what we want
2014-01-13T19:23:35 <colinclark> So, we know that the STMM and RBMM both use a local Solutions Registry
2014-01-13T19:23:55 <colinclark> So they need to be redeployed with the latest review2 branch of Universal, right?
2014-01-13T19:24:04 <michelled> yep
2014-01-13T19:24:22 * avtar joined the channel
2014-01-13T19:24:29 <colinclark> And the Cloud-Based Flow Manager presumably should be similarly deployed against the latest review2 universal?
2014-01-13T19:24:38 <colinclark> is that it for our updates?
2014-01-13T19:24:44 <michelled> hey avtar colinclark and I were just going over what needs to be updated
2014-01-13T19:24:46 <michelled> he said:
2014-01-13T19:24:55 <michelled> So, we know that the STMM and RBMM both use a local Solutions Registry
2014-01-13T19:24:55 <michelled> [2:13pm] colinclark: So they need to be redeployed with the latest review2 branch of Universa
2014-01-13T19:25:29 <michelled> colinclark: yes, I believe flow manager should also be redeployed
2014-01-13T19:25:53 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T19:25:55 <colinclark> easy enough
2014-01-13T19:26:04 <colinclark> For the STMM, we deployed Antranig\'s fork
2014-01-13T19:26:09 <colinclark> but then I pushed his changes
2014-01-13T19:26:12 <avtar> is the latest universal review2 branch referenced in the stmm and rbmm\'s package.json files?
2014-01-13T19:26:17 <colinclark> not yet, no
2014-01-13T19:26:21 <colinclark> that\'s the first change we\'ll have to make
2014-01-13T19:26:41 <colinclark> avtar: For the RBMM, you deployed using an essentially unmodified version of Nick\'s RBMM repo, right?
2014-01-13T19:26:48 <avtar> yes
2014-01-13T19:26:58 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T19:27:41 <colinclark> michelled: Do you want me to just go ahead and prepare two repositories?
2014-01-13T19:27:51 <colinclark> I guess I\'ll make "review2" branches for both RBMMM and STMM?
2014-01-13T19:28:00 <michelled> colinclark: that would be great!
2014-01-13T19:30:12 <colinclark> ok, here I go
2014-01-13T19:30:26 <colinclark> michelled: Do you want to take a stab at the one for the Flow Manager?
2014-01-13T19:30:35 <colinclark> or perhaps it has already been updated
2014-01-13T19:31:40 <michelled> I\'ll look
2014-01-13T19:35:07 <michelled> colinclark: I said "I\'ll look" but now I\'m not sure where I should be looking. Which repo does the flow manager live in?
2014-01-13T19:35:17 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-13T19:35:30 <colinclark> welcome to GPII bootcamp
2014-01-13T19:35:36 <colinclark> so much to learn, all while panicking!
2014-01-13T19:35:59 <colinclark> All the non-platform specific modules of the "real-time framework" live in the Universal repository
2014-01-13T19:36:03 <michelled> at least I have the panicking down :)
2014-01-13T19:36:06 <colinclark> so I guess that pretty much seals the deal
2014-01-13T19:36:19 <colinclark> since Universal is unlikely to have a dependency on another version of itself :P
2014-01-13T19:36:25 <colinclark> that was easy
2014-01-13T19:36:31 <michelled> :)
2014-01-13T19:36:44 <colinclark> "pfffft"
2014-01-13T19:37:55 <michelled> cool, I\'ll continue going through all the commits to the review branches and documenting them on the 505 JIRA
2014-01-13T19:38:49 <colinclark> So, insanely stupid git question
2014-01-13T19:38:58 <colinclark> but git commits are globally unique
2014-01-13T19:39:38 <colinclark> does this mean I can simply refer to the latest commit hash on review2 and that\'s enough/
2014-01-13T19:39:50 <michelled> yes
2014-01-13T19:40:22 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T19:40:24 <colinclark> here we go
2014-01-13T19:40:57 <colinclark> I guess the point is that when you refer to a module via a git dependency with npm, you\'re not actually getting a repo
2014-01-13T19:41:10 <colinclark> you\'re just getting the state of the code at a particular commit
2014-01-13T19:41:37 <colinclark> whether that\'s the current head of a particular branch or an explicitly-named commit
2014-01-13T19:41:54 <michelled> makes sense. git makes pretty complex things easy
2014-01-13T19:42:10 <colinclark> and the theory was that we use explicit commit hashes so that npm can unambiguously recognize the same dependency in other projects
2014-01-13T19:42:19 <colinclark> but sadly on newer versions of npm this seems to have regress
2014-01-13T19:42:23 <colinclark> regressed
2014-01-13T19:42:32 <colinclark> I\'ll have to make up a simplified test case once this chaos is over
2014-01-13T19:42:58 * yzen joined the channel
2014-01-13T19:43:03 <michelled> I think it\'s safer to use a commit hash with code that is in such a state of change.
2014-01-13T19:44:09 <colinclark> it\'s just such a pain to keep all references in sync
2014-01-13T19:44:25 <colinclark> but I agree with you
2014-01-13T19:44:57 <Bosmon> "relatively urgently" we need to move over to a set of grunt scripts that portably deal with setting up the GPII on the different platforms
2014-01-13T19:45:10 <Bosmon> As well as automatically cleansing duplicate copies of infusion, etc.
2014-01-13T19:45:35 <Bosmon> We should also think of setting up some kind of "institutional mirror" of npm since the central registry is so appallingly slow
2014-01-13T19:48:04 <colinclark> I agree with both those ideas
2014-01-13T19:48:49 <colinclark> michelled: is there an umbrella issue for updating to the latest review2 references?
2014-01-13T19:48:56 <colinclark> or should I file one for this particular instance of the task?
2014-01-13T19:49:52 <michelled> the umbrella JIRA for the review2 branches is GPII-505
2014-01-13T19:50:04 <michelled> but feel free to file a new one and link them together
2014-01-13T19:50:22 <colinclark> GPII-505 seems appropriate
2014-01-13T19:50:36 <colinclark> it\'s a real bummer that we don\'t have the git plugin configured for Confluence
2014-01-13T19:50:43 <colinclark> I know it\'s something The T mentioned
2014-01-13T19:51:03 <michelled> yes, that would be very nice
2014-01-13T19:51:14 <Justin_o_> yzen: what is it that controls the applying of preferences on a system..
2014-01-13T19:51:29 <yzen> lifecycle manager
2014-01-13T19:51:46 <Justin_o_> yzen: thanks
2014-01-13T19:51:49 <Justin_o_> found a bug
2014-01-13T19:51:56 <yzen> cool what is it ?
2014-01-13T19:52:01 <Justin_o_> if you login twice it turns off ORCA
2014-01-13T19:52:10 <Justin_o_> so when we switch from PMT to PCP it turns off
2014-01-13T19:52:53 <yzen> login twice in a row ?
2014-01-13T19:54:32 <Justin_o_> yzen: yes, you can try this with the url to login a user that uses the screen reader.. basically if you login twice it enables the first time and disables the second
2014-01-13T19:54:39 <Justin_o_> yzen: pcp also logs in a user
2014-01-13T19:54:52 <Justin_o_> yzen: with the token
2014-01-13T19:55:05 <Justin_o_> cindyli: hmm.. i wonder if the pcp actually needs to log a user in
2014-01-13T19:55:08 <colinclark> We should definitely be more resilient to double-logins. But isn\'t it also a bug that the PCP tries to log in the user even if they\'ve already been logged in?
2014-01-13T19:55:10 <yzen> Justin_o_: will you be able to open a JIRA for that ?
2014-01-13T19:55:23 <colinclark> Justin_o_: I don\'t think the PCP should ever log in a user
2014-01-13T19:55:26 <Justin_o_> yzen: i\'m writing it right now
2014-01-13T19:55:28 <Justin_o_> almost done
2014-01-13T19:55:38 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i guess it just logs them out
2014-01-13T19:55:41 <colinclark> The user can login either by:
2014-01-13T19:55:43 <colinclark> 1) keying in with some kind of physical login device
2014-01-13T19:55:58 <colinclark> 2) creating a brand new preference set in the PMT
2014-01-13T19:56:01 <Justin_o_> yzen: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-517
2014-01-13T19:56:06 <yzen> cool
2014-01-13T19:56:14 <Justin_o_> colinclark: okay.. i guess we should pull that bit of code out then :)
2014-01-13T19:56:38 <Justin_o_> colinclark: oh i know why we do it.. we need to get the initial preference set
2014-01-13T19:56:47 <Justin_o_> to set the values of the adjusters in PCP
2014-01-13T19:57:04 <colinclark> Do you have the user\'s token?
2014-01-13T19:57:06 <Justin_o_> colinclark, yzen: i guess we can just do a get on their profile
2014-01-13T19:57:15 <cindyli> Justin_o_: we might be able to do get() without a re-login
2014-01-13T19:57:20 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-13T19:57:21 <Justin_o_> colinclark: yes, we do
2014-01-13T19:57:24 <Justin_o_> have the token
2014-01-13T19:57:26 <colinclark> the Flow Manager is decently RESTful
2014-01-13T19:57:35 <colinclark> in that /users/<token> should provide you with the user\'s set
2014-01-13T19:57:43 <Justin_o_> colinclark: cool
2014-01-13T19:57:49 <Justin_o_> i\'ll try to change that
2014-01-13T19:57:50 <colinclark> without requiring you to login with /user/<token>/login
2014-01-13T19:57:58 <Justin_o_> cindyli: you want to pair up on this
2014-01-13T19:58:05 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o_
2014-01-13T19:58:06 <colinclark> thanks, Justin_o_
2014-01-13T19:58:41 <colinclark> This is perhaps a question no one knows the answer to
2014-01-13T19:59:00 <colinclark> but do we expect the node-only portion of the RBMM to be able to start up successfully in absence of its Java buddy?
2014-01-13T19:59:15 <colinclark> I\'m trying to at least do a basic test for avtar before he redeploys
2014-01-13T19:59:26 * clown has quit
2014-01-13T19:59:38 <colinclark> but I only get the usual Connect deprecation warning message, followed by this
2014-01-13T19:59:40 <colinclark> 14:48:12.591:   Firing event onRegisterHandler of component with typename kettle.server and id 6y6rio5o-8 to list of 2 listeners
2014-01-13T19:59:43 <colinclark> and then it exists
2014-01-13T19:59:44 <colinclark> exits
2014-01-13T19:59:49 <colinclark> ceases to exist
2014-01-13T20:02:04 * clown joined the channel
2014-01-13T20:02:37 <colinclark> My only fear with this is that the RBMM was previously depending on pre-Christmas version of universal
2014-01-13T20:02:42 <colinclark> I guess you don\'t know, do you avtar?
2014-01-13T20:02:55 <avtar> colinclark: i believe i ran the node app without its tomcat buddy when we first set up everything
2014-01-13T20:03:03 <colinclark> damn
2014-01-13T20:03:12 <Bosmon> colinclark - can you point me to the RBMM repo?
2014-01-13T20:03:15 <Bosmon> That is, our bit of it
2014-01-13T20:03:32 <colinclark> Bosmon: This is the node side of the equation: https://github.com/NickKaklanis/RuleBased_MatchMaker
2014-01-13T20:04:41 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2014-01-13T20:04:43 <Bosmon> I remember now
2014-01-13T20:04:48 <Bosmon> I didn\'t really want to look at this :)
2014-01-13T20:04:57 <colinclark> no
2014-01-13T20:05:15 <colinclark> One has to wonder what the Java server actually does
2014-01-13T20:05:41 <colinclark> since this appears to be a massive collection of conditions keyed off hard-coded preferences
2014-01-13T20:06:28 <Bosmon> You have to love that commit message
2014-01-13T20:06:32 <Bosmon> "bugs fixed"
2014-01-13T20:06:48 <colinclark> A culture of community
2014-01-13T20:07:16 <colinclark> avtar: I didn\'t notice that the Node.js app also logs to /logs https://github.com/NickKaklanis/RuleBased_MatchMaker/blob/master/lib/Log.js#L4
2014-01-13T20:07:30 <colinclark> fs.mkdir(path.resolve(__dirname, logDir));        //SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT WORK DUE TO PERMISSION ISSUES!
'

b'2014-01-13T17:04:44 <colinclark> you should give jhernandez a real high five for me
2014-01-13T17:04:49 <colinclark> right now, in the middle of the meeting
2014-01-13T17:04:53 <colinclark> just walk over and do it
2014-01-13T17:06:28 <kasparnet> he\'s not here right now, probably out in the hallway taking a nap
2014-01-13T17:07:28 <kasparnet> michelled: you\'re right, it\'s not deployed.. I meant the solution registry files for each matchmaker (ie. universal/testData/solutions)
2014-01-13T17:08:02 <avtar> kasparnet: each matchmaker being og matchmaker, stmm, and rbmm?
2014-01-13T17:08:07 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: I have no idea... There is still some confusion as to what/how we\'ll actually test it... I\'m due to chat with the other kostas about that in a bit
2014-01-13T17:08:31 <kasparnet> avtar: yeah - if the og mm is identical to the online flowmanager
2014-01-13T17:08:49 <kasparnet> avtar: but if we could hold back for ~1 hr or so with it, that would be great
2014-01-13T17:09:13 <avtar> flowmanager proxies to og matchmaker
2014-01-13T17:09:16 <avtar> if that\'s what you mean
2014-01-13T17:09:23 <avtar> ok cool
2014-01-13T17:09:29 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s what he means
2014-01-13T17:09:39 <colinclark> the dependency structure of these apps is still slightly fuzzy to us
2014-01-13T17:09:41 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: okay.. i\'m hoping it shouldn\'t really matter
2014-01-13T17:10:25 <colinclark> but I believe the STMM, RBMM, and Cloud-Based Flow Manager all need to have their package.jsons updated to the latest review2 branch and then redeployed
2014-01-13T17:10:38 <colinclark> with the usual npm shenanigans in there
2014-01-13T17:11:03 <avtar> 10-4
2014-01-13T17:11:09 <avtar> kasparnet: ping me when it\'s safe to do so
2014-01-13T17:11:50 <colinclark> thanks to avtar, I am singing Ice-T to myself this morning :P
2014-01-13T17:11:54 <colinclark> I\'m not sure it\'s a good thing
2014-01-13T17:11:58 <kasparnet> hehe
2014-01-13T17:12:03 <jhernandez> colinclark: OG
2014-01-13T17:12:06 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-01-13T17:12:14 <colinclark> "This is Ice-T. Get to the point!"

2014-01-13T17:12:36 <kasparnet> jhernandez: if I was to claim that all the linux gsettings were applied dynamically - would you call me a liar
2014-01-13T17:12:39 <kasparnet> ?
2014-01-13T17:13:15 <kasparnet> (ie if the magnifier is launched and I change the mag-factor via gsettings - it would update automagically)
2014-01-13T17:13:22 <avtar> colinclark: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huq2Kx9p87k
2014-01-13T17:15:40 <michelled> I\'m fairly sure you can lindy hop to this
2014-01-13T17:17:24 <colinclark> avtar: this is hilarious :)
2014-01-13T17:19:58 <colinclark> michelled: You\'re lindy hopping to Ice-T?

2014-01-13T17:31:17 <kasparnet> yzen: jhernandez and I just confirmed that gsettings stuff are dynamically applied
2014-01-13T17:31:33 <yzen> cool
2014-01-13T17:32:06 <jhernandez> well, most of gsettings stuff should be applied dynamicly, but (of course) there are some exceptions
2014-01-13T17:35:18 <colinclark> wow, are you to the point where you\'re actually seeing results in the PCP, kasparnet?
2014-01-13T17:35:49 <kasparnet> colinclark: no - totally not -- tying up all other sorts of loose ends
2014-01-13T17:35:56 <colinclark> ah, ok

2014-01-13T17:38:23 <Justin_o_> michelled, kasparnet, colinclark: i can fix the styling for the "Save & Apply" button in pcp with a hack... is that acceptable for the review.. basically i just removed a class and added an inline style to position it absolutely below the pcp adjusters...
2014-01-13T17:39:42 <michelled> if it\'s a hack you don\'t think should go into master, it might be time to create a review2 branch for the prefs editors
2014-01-13T17:43:03 <colinclark> I guess one question is whether or not there are other styling changes that need to happen moving forward anyway
2014-01-13T17:43:22 <colinclark> I\'m thinking of my "don\'t look broken" principle in terms of whether or not this should go into master
2014-01-13T17:55:55 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-13T17:58:26 * clown joined the channel
2014-01-13T18:01:41 * SteveLee joined the channel
2014-01-13T18:02:20 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-01-13T18:03:34 <Justin_o_> colinclark, michelled: good points.. i wouldn\'t normally want this in master.. but it solves the don\'t look broken issue. I think there will need to be a round or two of cleanup post review regardless. There are spots where the PCP/PMT code integration could be tightened up.
2014-01-13T18:04:59 <colinclark> I\'ll defer to michelled, but my impression is that we should put it into master with a very clear comment and associated JIRA about how it needs to be fixed
2014-01-13T18:05:10 <colinclark> the overhead of hack branches is high
2014-01-13T18:06:56 * SteveLee looks around
2014-01-13T18:07:32 <kasparnet> welcome SteveLee
2014-01-13T18:07:47 <Justin_o_> colinclark: we may need a redo styling jira :)
2014-01-13T18:07:55 <SteveLee> kaspernet thanks
2014-01-13T18:08:27 <colinclark> SteveLee!!!
2014-01-13T18:08:32 <colinclark> hello!
2014-01-13T18:08:36 <colinclark> Justin_o_: lol
2014-01-13T18:08:43 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i was thinking while looking at all this that it may have been easier if we had been using a framework.. so perhaps this could all get cleaned up after we pick one for infusion...
2014-01-13T18:08:52 <michelled> colinclark: it\'s looking like the demo is going to happen off cindyli and Justin_o_
2014-01-13T18:08:57 <michelled> branch anyway
2014-01-13T18:09:08 <colinclark> michelled: ah, ok
2014-01-13T18:09:15 <michelled> so, we are thinking that Justin_o_ will make the changes in that branch and comment on that JIRA
2014-01-13T18:09:25 <michelled> then the cleanup can happen before that branch merges into master
2014-01-13T18:09:40 <SteveLee> colinclark, hello. Shame you\'re not here with us but IRC is almost as good
2014-01-13T18:10:05 <colinclark> I\'ll be with you over GoToMeeting at something like 5 am my time for the review on Wednesay
2014-01-13T18:10:18 <SteveLee> cool!
2014-01-13T18:10:24 <colinclark> How\'s it going in Lux?
2014-01-13T18:10:40 <kasparnet> we were supposed to be done with todays meeting 2 hrs ago
2014-01-13T18:10:49 <kasparnet> colinclark .. but I guess that\'s hardly surprising
2014-01-13T18:10:53 <SteveLee> yep, intense
2014-01-13T18:11:00 <colinclark> wow
2014-01-13T18:11:08 <colinclark> lots of talking? ;)
2014-01-13T18:11:23 <kasparnet> only thing that worries me is all the shit that needs to get done before tomorrow
2014-01-13T18:11:26 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-01-13T18:11:29 <kasparnet> just presentations
2014-01-13T18:11:49 <kasparnet> which I\'m totally ignoring, fixing stuff from my todo-list
2014-01-13T18:11:53 <colinclark> Is your to do list shared somewhere Kasper, and is there some way we can help?
2014-01-13T18:12:27 <kasparnet> colinclark: nope - this one is made out of paper
2014-01-13T18:12:33 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: who\'s branch are you going to use for PMT/PCP?
2014-01-13T18:12:39 <kasparnet> colinclark: it has a lot of names on it, but yours isn\'t one
2014-01-13T18:12:46 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: whichever one you tell me to use
2014-01-13T18:12:48 <kasparnet> :)
2014-01-13T18:12:56 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: :) okay
2014-01-13T18:12:58 <colinclark> ok, I\'m still chipping away at the "slow demo"
2014-01-13T18:13:12 <colinclark> kasparnet: Do you know if Ignacio was able to print out copies of the architecture "circle diagram"?
2014-01-13T18:13:22 <kasparnet> I got one
2014-01-13T18:13:30 <kasparnet> colinclark: think he needs to print more though
2014-01-13T18:13:38 <colinclark> Do they look ok?
2014-01-13T18:13:45 <kasparnet> (especially cause I\'m most certainly gonna loose mine before EOD)
2014-01-13T18:13:53 <colinclark> you must be so tired!
2014-01-13T18:13:54 <kasparnet> they were beautiful
2014-01-13T18:14:00 <colinclark> phew
2014-01-13T18:14:22 <kasparnet> yeah - but I\'m comforted by the fact that I dont have anything to do Thursday
2014-01-13T18:14:31 <colinclark> you probably never had the chance to see the new diagrams I made for your Deliverable over the holiday
2014-01-13T18:14:35 <SteveLee> just you wait!
2014-01-13T18:14:45 <SteveLee> I\'ll have some Maavis pull request for your
2014-01-13T18:15:04 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: i\'ll send an e-mail to the list later today about which branch for PMT/PCp
2014-01-13T18:15:10 <kasparnet> damn you SteveLee
2014-01-13T18:15:21 <kasparnet> cool, thanks Justin_o_
2014-01-13T18:15:25 <colinclark> kasparnet: If anything feels delegatable, just let michelled know and she can get people on it
2014-01-13T18:15:33 <colinclark> on your to do list, I mean
2014-01-13T18:15:45 <kasparnet> thanks colinclark (and michelled)

2014-01-13T18:28:59 <kasparnet> we still have some testing to do
2014-01-13T18:29:03 <kasparnet> cheers, Bosmon
2014-01-13T18:29:06 <Bosmon> How have the DRESS REHEARSALS gone?
2014-01-13T18:29:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon: we didn\'t do them properly - will do so tomorrow morning
2014-01-13T18:29:25 <kasparnet> we just talked through them today
2014-01-13T18:29:33 <Bosmon> cool
2014-01-13T18:29:40 <Bosmon> When do the demos proper start?
2014-01-13T18:29:44 <kasparnet> (which I\'m thankful for -- too many loose ends - though not on our (architecture) teams side
2014-01-13T18:29:49 <kasparnet> wednesday morning
2014-01-13T18:29:49 <Bosmon> Is the places already swarming with *EUROCRATTS*?
2014-01-13T18:29:55 <kasparnet> not yet
2014-01-13T18:30:09 <kasparnet> Bosmon: anyway - gotta run - only one not packed up
2014-01-13T18:30:17 <Bosmon> cool, have a good dinner
2014-01-13T18:30:19 <kasparnet> will be back online in 1.5 hour or so
2014-01-13T18:30:21 <kasparnet> thanks
2014-01-13T18:30:25 <kasparnet> later
2014-01-13T18:30:25 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-13T18:50:40 <colinclark> So michelled, maybe we should coordainte the repository upgrades now
2014-01-13T18:50:48 <colinclark> I can\'t even spell
2014-01-13T18:50:51 <colinclark> coordinate
2014-01-13T18:50:53 <colinclark> nom nom nom
2014-01-13T18:51:12 <colinclark> or we could just spin Ice-T tunes off YouTube
2014-01-13T18:51:14 <colinclark> up to you
2014-01-13T18:51:49 <colinclark> yzen and Bosmon: Do we need to have a discussion about next steps for Kettle/PCP/CORS/Web Sockets soon?
2014-01-13T18:55:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - I can\'t say I understand the current PCP/PMT system at all, or have seen the thinking behind it
2014-01-13T18:58:51 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-01-13T19:00:07 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s why I was thinking we should talk it through
'

b'2014-01-13T03:06:09 <colinclark> we would be completely and utterly hopeless without you
2014-01-13T03:06:17 <colinclark> you know, you and avtar must be brothers
2014-01-13T03:06:17 <kasparnet> I\'m horribly unsuccessful in getting the PCP/PMT up and running though - so think I\'ll just sleep instead :)
2014-01-13T03:06:19 <colinclark> since he\'s amazing
2014-01-13T03:06:25 <colinclark> and we\'d be utterly hopeless without him, too
2014-01-13T03:06:29 <kasparnet> and have boyan hotline me tomorrow
2014-01-13T03:06:32 <kasparnet> indeed we would
2014-01-13T03:06:35 <colinclark> kasparnet: That makes sense
2014-01-13T03:06:41 <colinclark> Yura will do what he can later
2014-01-13T03:06:57 <colinclark> and I think Boyan and Alex are probably in good shape to get it working tomorrow during their time
2014-01-13T03:07:11 <colinclark> thank you again, kasparnet
2014-01-13T03:07:13 <colinclark> sleep well
2014-01-13T03:07:16 <kasparnet> colinclark, avtar: well, thanks for all your work over the weekend and tonight!!!! tty tomorrow at some point
2014-01-13T03:07:18 <kasparnet> thanks
2014-01-13T03:07:20 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-13T03:07:26 <colinclark> well, that\'s it
2014-01-13T03:07:29 <colinclark> I call this a success
2014-01-13T03:07:49 <colinclark> avtar: I really am insanely indebted to me
2014-01-13T03:07:55 <colinclark> so you should consider ways that I can repay you
2014-01-13T03:08:23 <colinclark> wow, that came out wrong
2014-01-13T03:08:27 <colinclark> let me say that again
2014-01-13T03:08:32 <colinclark> avtar: I really am insanely indebted to YOU
2014-01-13T03:09:08 <avtar> right back at ya, buddy
2014-01-13T03:09:17 <avtar> the conversation last week settled my nerves
2014-01-13T03:09:31 <avtar> so let\'s just say we\'re even :P
2014-01-13T03:10:05 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-13T03:10:20 <colinclark> I\'m hoping everyone might want to let me take them out for lunch this week
2014-01-13T03:11:29 <Bosmon> Next month it is I who will be taking YOU out
2014-01-13T03:11:38 <Bosmon> And you can choose ANY WINE FROM THE GIANT DIRECCKTORY!
2014-01-13T03:11:45 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-13T03:12:05 <Bosmon> I don\'t think we took you to Greenbriar yet?
2014-01-13T03:12:08 <Bosmon> It\'s a pretty amazing place
2014-01-13T03:12:12 <colinclark> no, I don\'t think so

2014-01-13T14:34:14 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-01-13T14:34:24 <jhernandez> nope
2014-01-13T14:34:56 <sgithens> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2014-January/001726.html
2014-01-13T14:35:13 <jhernandez> since we\'re going to use mifare-based tags for the ec review I\'m using your GPII-246 branch
2014-01-13T14:35:33 <sgithens> oh
2014-01-13T14:35:37 <sgithens> just a sec
2014-01-13T14:35:57 <jhernandez> sgithens: no prob
2014-01-13T14:36:00 <jhernandez> and thanks!
2014-01-13T14:37:35 <Justin_o_> jhung: I think cindyli and I will probably have another day of GPII work. I think we won\'t be coming back to metadata till tomorrow
2014-01-13T14:38:02 <jhung> Justin_o_: no prob.
2014-01-13T14:38:13 <sgithens> jhernandez: sudo python pcscutil.py runlistener
2014-01-13T14:38:24 <sgithens> is that the command you\'re using to start it?
2014-01-13T14:38:37 <jhernandez> yup
2014-01-13T14:38:52 <sgithens> and you have pcscd started?
2014-01-13T14:39:13 <jhernandez> yup
2014-01-13T14:39:42 <jhernandez> I\'m wondering if the problem could be the version of pcsc-lite
2014-01-13T14:40:22 <sgithens> aren\'t you using ntags for the android demo?
2014-01-13T14:40:40 <jhernandez> nope
2014-01-13T14:40:53 <jhernandez> mifare-based
2014-01-13T14:41:24 <sgithens> ugh, I thought we wanted to switch everything to ntags
2014-01-13T14:41:31 * jhernandez too
2014-01-13T14:42:23 <jhernandez> but we wanted to go over a solid-rock (and safer) solution for the review
2014-01-13T14:42:42 <jhernandez> in fact, I\'m not sure if my android device supports ntags ... let me check
2014-01-13T14:44:17 <sgithens> jhernandez: I have to run to campus in a sec
2014-01-13T14:45:16 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-01-13T14:45:18 <jhernandez> no prob sgithens
2014-01-13T14:45:36 <jhernandez> we\'ll be around for a long time
2014-01-13T14:46:08 <jhernandez> we have to ensure that the demos will work during the review

2014-01-13T16:43:01 <colinclark> How did today go, kasparnet and jhernandez?
2014-01-13T16:44:20 <kasparnet> yes - sure
2014-01-13T16:47:30 <kasparnet> avtar: what are the URLs again
2014-01-13T16:48:05 <avtar> terms.raisingthefloor.org -> 205.211.169.180 and 205.211.169.181
2014-01-13T16:48:23 * clown_mtg has quit
2014-01-13T16:50:20 <kasparnet> avtar: ok, done
2014-01-13T16:50:33 <avtar> merci
2014-01-13T16:50:35 <kasparnet> colinclark: we didn\'t actually try out the demo\'s today - we just walked through the plan
2014-01-13T16:50:40 <kasparnet> will do them tomorrow
2014-01-13T16:51:08 <kasparnet> avtar: de rien
2014-01-13T16:51:31 <kasparnet> colinclark: but things are looking pretty decent - have tested most of what we can, and my TODO is down to 1 page :)
2014-01-13T16:51:40 <colinclark> nice
2014-01-13T16:52:18 <colinclark> kasparnet: So I guess we need to redeploy the Matchmakers against the latest review2 universal, right?
2014-01-13T16:52:36 <colinclark> Would you like someone to give you a hand with that?
2014-01-13T16:52:51 <colinclark> Is there anything else we can do to help?
2014-01-13T16:53:11 <colinclark> It sounds like Justin_o_, cindyli, and yzen are putting the finishing touches on the PCP/PMT combo
2014-01-13T16:53:26 <colinclark> kasparnet: Were you ever able to get them up and running to test with?
2014-01-13T17:00:14 <michelled> kasparnet: you mentioned you needed the solutions registry updated
2014-01-13T17:01:00 <michelled> kasparnet: it\'s my understanding that it isn\'t actually deployed - am I missing something?
2014-01-13T17:02:16 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: do you know what window size you\'ll be using when you demonstrate PMT and PCP?
2014-01-13T17:02:52 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah - earlier today, though it looked a bit odd and I\'m pretty certain I screwed something up
2014-01-13T17:03:18 <kasparnet> the other kostas is here though, so we\'re gonna take a look at it later today, when the damn meetings are over
2014-01-13T17:03:26 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-13T17:03:35 <colinclark> Tell Other Kostas I say hi
2014-01-13T17:03:43 <colinclark> Have you slapped Nice Nick five for me?
2014-01-13T17:04:12 <kasparnet> colinclark: I totally did
2014-01-13T17:04:21 <kasparnet> it was more of a verbal high five
2014-01-13T17:04:25 <colinclark> fair enough
2014-01-13T17:04:31 <kasparnet> but I think the message got through
'

b'2014-01-13T02:13:00 <colinclark> hmm
2014-01-13T02:13:25 <colinclark> It\'s saved as a session cookie, but then when do you expect the browser to use it?
2014-01-13T02:13:39 <colinclark> i.e. do you need it for subsequent requests to the Flow Manager?
2014-01-13T02:13:47 <colinclark> or is it read by client-side code?
2014-01-13T02:14:00 <yzen> so when we ll be doing the update
2014-01-13T02:14:13 <yzen> we would need to make sure that it\'s done as part of the session
2014-01-13T02:14:44 <colinclark> meaning the session cookie needs to be sent back to the Flow Manager?
2014-01-13T02:15:00 <colinclark> and that presumably is also done via the socket.io connection
2014-01-13T02:15:38 <colinclark> I guess perhaps it is a same origin policy issue...
2014-01-13T02:15:55 <colinclark> since your webpage is running on localhost:80 and the Flow Manager is on 8081?
2014-01-13T02:16:38 <colinclark> So I guess two things come to mind, neither of which may be very sensible
2014-01-13T02:16:47 <yzen> colinclark: was thinking that too let me see
2014-01-13T02:16:55 <colinclark> 1. Is it possible to serve up the PCP/PMT pages from the Flow Manager itself?
2014-01-13T02:17:19 <colinclark> 2. Is there some other way to send along the session ID to the Flow Manager rather than relying on a cookie?
2014-01-13T02:17:46 <colinclark> It seems like #1 might well be much simpler
2014-01-13T02:17:48 <yzen> colinclark: so the cookie is not actually set at all
2014-01-13T02:17:54 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T02:19:09 <kasparnet> colinclark, yzen: a bit of an odd question, but when I\'m running a local instance of the GPII in multi-matchmaker mode
2014-01-13T02:19:14 <kasparnet> what solution registry is being used?
2014-01-13T02:19:24 <kasparnet> it seems it\'s not the one on my local file system
2014-01-13T02:19:33 <yzen> kasparnet: the one which the match maker is deployed with
2014-01-13T02:19:40 <colinclark> that\'s not an odd question at all :)
2014-01-13T02:19:45 <colinclark> we had a lot of confusion about that earlier
2014-01-13T02:19:53 <kasparnet> ok, so each matchmaker has it\'s own version of the repo
2014-01-13T02:19:57 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-13T02:20:00 <kasparnet> of the solutionregistry*
2014-01-13T02:20:02 <kasparnet> ok
2014-01-13T02:20:03 <colinclark> will you need access to this to modify it?
2014-01-13T02:20:09 <colinclark> or will that be a terrible problem?
2014-01-13T02:20:19 <kasparnet> no, no terrible problems
2014-01-13T02:20:36 <kasparnet> but there is one entry in the statistical MM that I would like updated
2014-01-13T02:20:44 <kasparnet> but it doesn\'t have to be tongith
2014-01-13T02:21:04 <kasparnet> just before the review
2014-01-13T02:21:17 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T02:21:31 <colinclark> I think the idea was that avtar was going to give you a key to the kingdom
2014-01-13T02:21:34 <colinclark> or at least part of one
2014-01-13T02:21:38 <kasparnet> cool
2014-01-13T02:21:40 <colinclark> so you could make updates while he sleeps and has a normal life
2014-01-13T02:21:45 <colinclark> don\'t quote me on that
2014-01-13T02:21:48 <colinclark> but I think that was the idea
2014-01-13T02:21:52 <yzen> :)
2014-01-13T02:22:00 <kasparnet> I cant imagine I\'d need to touch anything but the solution registry files
2014-01-13T02:22:39 <colinclark> I believe both MMs are deployed with master universals
2014-01-13T02:22:45 <colinclark> but we can, tomorrow, change that
2014-01-13T02:22:53 <kasparnet> ah
2014-01-13T02:23:06 <colinclark> and you can at least push up your changes to review2 and then it\'s probably a matter of just git pulling and stopping/starting the server
2014-01-13T02:23:21 <kasparnet> the change in question should already be there
2014-01-13T02:23:38 <kasparnet> .. but maavis to wont make it in until tomorrow, so there is no rush with the update
2014-01-13T02:23:42 <colinclark> ah, ok
2014-01-13T02:23:58 <yzen> hah interesting colinclark , i think it\'s related to what your were saying
2014-01-13T02:24:02 <colinclark> so we\'ll need each matchmaker to refer to the latest version of universal\'s review2 branch
2014-01-13T02:24:06 <colinclark> SOP, yzen?
2014-01-13T02:24:32 <yzen> if i host the client on 8888, and the fm is on 8080 the 8080 can\'t set a cookie right ?
2014-01-13T02:24:41 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-13T02:24:46 <colinclark> that\'s likely the case
2014-01-13T02:24:49 <yzen> what about with CORS?
2014-01-13T02:24:52 <colinclark> I don\'t know
2014-01-13T02:24:56 <yzen> ok ill try
2014-01-13T02:24:56 <colinclark> but I wouldn\'t count on it
2014-01-13T02:25:26 <colinclark> it looks like it\'s possibly supported with CORS, yes
2014-01-13T02:26:13 <yzen> colinclark: do you have a source of that ?
2014-01-13T02:26:17 <colinclark> It looks like the server can indeed say whether cookies should be respected
2014-01-13T02:26:18 <colinclark> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
2014-01-13T02:26:29 <colinclark> " Servers can also notify clients whether "credentials" (including Cookies and HTTP Authentication data) should be sent with requests."
2014-01-13T02:26:52 <colinclark> though it\'s not clear if this is only for XHR
2014-01-13T02:27:02 <colinclark> XHR appears to have this "withCredentials" flag
2014-01-13T02:27:24 <yzen> yep
2014-01-13T02:27:28 <yzen> will try now :)
2014-01-13T02:31:01 <colinclark> If that doesn\'t work, could you mount a Kettle app that will serve up the PMT/PCP static pages from the same origin as the Flow Manager?
2014-01-13T02:31:06 <colinclark> a bit like how Evgeni\'s original demo did
2014-01-13T02:33:47 <yzen> !BGIBADVAOsn lk WORKS!
2014-01-13T02:33:55 <colinclark> WOOOOOOOOT
2014-01-13T02:33:57 <yzen> sakgner;k gw;lr
2014-01-13T02:33:59 <yzen> yes :)
2014-01-13T02:34:03 <colinclark> \xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8\xc3\xb8
2014-01-13T02:34:09 <colinclark> \xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98\xc3\x98
2014-01-13T02:34:31 <yzen> tbh i did not do anything special except this xhrField everything else is set up as expected
2014-01-13T02:35:04 <colinclark> SOP bites us again :)
2014-01-13T02:35:17 <yzen> haha
2014-01-13T02:35:31 <colinclark> I guess the more interesting issue is, do we know how to make this work with the PCP so Kasper can demonstrate it?
2014-01-13T02:35:58 <colinclark> YURA YOU RULE
2014-01-13T02:38:22 <yzen> well i think i can play with it in the evening
2014-01-13T02:38:29 <yzen> around 11ish
2014-01-13T02:38:49 <yzen> btw this is the client i did http://pastie.org/8628061
2014-01-13T02:39:21 <colinclark> awesome
2014-01-13T02:39:31 <colinclark> Do what you can later tonight, yzen
2014-01-13T02:39:59 <yzen> ok see you later, ill go offline for a bit
2014-01-13T02:40:04 <kasparnet> YAY!!!!!!!!!!! yzen
2014-01-13T02:40:10 <kasparnet> You\'re awesome!!
2014-01-13T02:40:16 <yzen> :)
2014-01-13T02:40:17 * yzen has quit
2014-01-13T02:41:12 <kasparnet> colinclark: I\'m gonna give 30 mins to an attempt to get PCP/PMT up and running - and then I\'m gonna crash
2014-01-13T02:41:19 <colinclark> yes, you should
2014-01-13T02:41:23 <colinclark> it\'s late
2014-01-13T02:41:42 <colinclark> Manuel and Gregg will understand if the PCP/PMT aren\'t quite working
2014-01-13T02:41:45 <kasparnet> colinclark: in any case, with yzen\'s new progress it might make sense to hold back on figuring out what to demo until tomorrow evening
2014-01-13T02:41:50 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2014-01-13T02:41:54 <colinclark> I gave them a heads up about the problems
2014-01-13T02:42:02 <colinclark> you can tell them tomorrow "we\'re really close"
2014-01-13T02:42:15 <kasparnet> cool
2014-01-13T02:42:35 <kasparnet> gonna give it a quick go now anyway - I\'m actually quite curious to see it in action
2014-01-13T02:45:14 <colinclark> I haven\'t seen it yet either
2014-01-13T02:46:37 <Bosmon> colinclark - shall I make the STMM pull to Andreas repo rather than to yours?
2014-01-13T02:46:51 <colinclark> Yes
2014-01-13T02:46:57 <colinclark> that makes sense
2014-01-13T02:46:57 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-13T02:49:13 * jhernandez has quit
2014-01-13T02:58:18 <avtar> just caught up on the channel log
2014-01-13T02:58:32 <avtar> kasparnet: you\'ll have keys to the kingdom
2014-01-13T02:58:44 <kasparnet> avtar: yay
2014-01-13T02:58:46 <kasparnet> but no rush
2014-01-13T02:58:49 <colinclark> hi avtar
2014-01-13T02:58:49 <colinclark> what\'d you have for dinner?
2014-01-13T02:58:55 <avtar> gluten free pasta
2014-01-13T02:58:59 <colinclark> nice
2014-01-13T02:59:10 <colinclark> me too
2014-01-13T02:59:32 <colinclark> with beans and broccoli
2014-01-13T02:59:44 <avtar> yumm
2014-01-13T02:59:58 <Bosmon> I have some BEEF CHILLIE
2014-01-13T02:59:59 <avtar> i just ate the pasta out of the bag
2014-01-13T03:00:19 <avtar> Bosmon: you win this round
2014-01-13T03:01:24 <avtar> colinclark: it looks like there\'s over a gig of free ram on the vm that\'s running stmm and rbmm
2014-01-13T03:01:33 <colinclark> that\'s good
2014-01-13T03:01:37 <avtar> i think we should be able to squeeze in more node processes
2014-01-13T03:01:45 <colinclark> so the RBMM isn\'t eating up RAM
2014-01-13T03:01:47 <avtar> so digital ocean might still be a viable option
2014-01-13T03:01:49 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T03:01:52 <avtar> well
2014-01-13T03:01:58 <avtar> it isn\'t eating any while it\'s sitting idle
2014-01-13T03:02:04 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-13T03:02:22 <avtar> i\'m wondering if it\'s safe to set up a cron job and delete files older than an hour from /logs on that vm
2014-01-13T03:02:34 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why not
2014-01-13T03:02:35 <avtar> i\'m assuming the services don\'t need them
2014-01-13T03:02:41 <colinclark> One would hope so
2014-01-13T03:02:47 <colinclark> or hope not
2014-01-13T03:02:48 <colinclark> or whatever
2014-01-13T03:02:54 <avtar> a bit of both
2014-01-13T03:03:07 <avtar> so are we good here for now?
2014-01-13T03:03:18 <colinclark> We are
2014-01-13T03:03:24 <avtar> ok
2014-01-13T03:03:31 <colinclark> kasparnet is proving how insanely heroic he is, staying up until almost 4 am
2014-01-13T03:03:40 <colinclark> but I think he\'s essentially tested everything that needed to be tested
2014-01-13T03:03:45 <colinclark> and your servers are going strong
2014-01-13T03:04:09 <colinclark> The only thing we\'ll need to do sometime tomorrow is to redeploy the MMs with the latest review2 branch of universal
2014-01-13T03:04:18 <colinclark> but that doesn\'t have to happen on any real schedule
2014-01-13T03:05:22 <kasparnet> yeah colinclark, avtar - pretty much everything I can test have worked
2014-01-13T03:05:42 <avtar> great success :D
2014-01-13T03:05:47 <kasparnet> there are a few things that fail - but I it seem to be a problem in the ST MM
2014-01-13T03:05:49 <kasparnet> indeed
2014-01-13T03:05:59 <colinclark> kasparnet, if I haven\'t already said so, you are fucking amazing
'

b'2014-01-13T01:26:11 <colinclark> sorry avtar
2014-01-13T01:26:17 <colinclark> i\'ll stop celebrating
2014-01-13T01:26:25 <colinclark> ok OG Flow
2014-01-13T01:26:47 <colinclark> Bosmon: We\'re still going to get blamed
2014-01-13T01:26:56 <Bosmon> Certainly we will
2014-01-13T01:27:00 <jhernandez> worked fine on linux too
2014-01-13T01:27:00 <colinclark> for not "releasing" the proxy
2014-01-13T01:27:03 <colinclark> for not documenting anything
2014-01-13T01:27:04 <Bosmon> But as you say, contextual vs. universal : P
2014-01-13T01:27:08 <colinclark> :) :)
2014-01-13T01:27:57 <kasparnet> oooh - what a fantastic IRC to catch up on
2014-01-13T01:28:12 <Bosmon> What fun for you, KASPARNETTT : P
2014-01-13T01:28:30 <kasparnet> my windows is all set (except of course for the million things I\'ve surely forgotten), so I\'ll start going through the NP sets on that
2014-01-13T01:29:19 <jhernandez> avtar: both stmm and rbmm are working fine here
2014-01-13T01:29:31 <Bosmon> yzen - are you still looking at socket.io?
2014-01-13T01:29:40 <colinclark> avtar: I\'m trying to look at the Flow Manager now
2014-01-13T01:30:24 <cindyli> colinclark: i\'m about to leave for tonight. is there anything you want from me before I leave?
2014-01-13T01:31:13 <cindyli> have sent an update to Boyan
2014-01-13T01:31:20 <cindyli> and the list
2014-01-13T01:31:23 <colinclark> cindyli: you are completely amazing
2014-01-13T01:31:27 <colinclark> I mean, seriously
2014-01-13T01:31:32 <cindyli> ;)
2014-01-13T01:31:36 <colinclark> I\'m sorry you had to give up a huge chunk of your weeknd
2014-01-13T01:31:38 <colinclark> weekend
2014-01-13T01:31:41 <colinclark> and I really appreciate your help
2014-01-13T01:31:47 <colinclark> Have a really good evening
2014-01-13T01:31:53 <colinclark> and say sorry to your family for me ;)
2014-01-13T01:32:33 <cindyli> no worries, you\'ve been working longer. have a good evening too, colinclark
2014-01-13T01:32:37 <colinclark> thanks again, cindyli
2014-01-13T01:32:41 <colinclark> This is the request I\'m using to test the OG Flow Manager with: http://pastebin.com/uvK2ATGw
2014-01-13T01:32:49 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-13T01:32:55 <colinclark> the response, avtar, is pure contextual hotness
2014-01-13T01:32:57 <colinclark> {"org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier":{"mag-factor":2,"screen-position":"right-half","show-cross-hairs":true,"lens-mode":false,"mouse-tracking":"proportional","scroll-at-edges":true}}
2014-01-13T01:33:16 <colinclark> kasparnet, jhernandez: seem like a reasonable response from it?
2014-01-13T01:33:42 <colinclark> kasparnet: Are you satisfied with the state of the Preferences Server at this point?
2014-01-13T01:34:25 <avtar> ah crap
2014-01-13T01:34:27 <avtar> the pref server
2014-01-13T01:34:39 <avtar> i forgot about those four sets that b0rked with kanso
2014-01-13T01:34:42 <colinclark> oh yes
2014-01-13T01:34:54 <colinclark> isn\'t kasper going to look at those?
2014-01-13T01:35:02 <colinclark> michelled said they were valid JSON
2014-01-13T01:35:11 <avtar> i believe michelle said it\'s valid json
2014-01-13T01:35:11 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah - that response looks correct
2014-01-13T01:35:12 <avtar> yes
2014-01-13T01:35:23 <avtar> so it must be a combination of bash and kanso
2014-01-13T01:35:32 <kasparnet> avtar: and it was only those 4 np sets?
2014-01-13T01:35:36 <avtar> yup
2014-01-13T01:35:41 <colinclark> avtar: I could totally give you a big germy kiss right now
2014-01-13T01:35:56 <avtar> don\'t hear that often...
2014-01-13T01:35:57 <avtar> enough
2014-01-13T01:36:02 <kasparnet> haha
2014-01-13T01:37:44 <avtar> colinclark: i\'m still seeing this on the vm that\'s running rbmm
2014-01-13T01:37:46 <avtar> fs: missing callback Error: EEXIST, mkdir \'/logs\'
2014-01-13T01:37:46 <avtar> fs: missing callback Error: EEXIST, mkdir \'/logs\'
2014-01-13T01:37:46 <avtar> fs: missing callback Error: EEXIST, mkdir \'/logs\'
2014-01-13T01:38:01 <colinclark> urg
2014-01-13T01:38:17 <colinclark> do we care if it is returning correct results?
2014-01-13T01:38:21 <colinclark> I can\'t believe I\'m even asking that
2014-01-13T01:38:36 <avtar> ls /logs | wc -l
2014-01-13T01:38:36 <avtar> 48
2014-01-13T01:39:02 <avtar> no, i guess we don\'t :|
2014-01-13T01:39:09 <jhernandez> kasparnet: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/review2/testData/preferences/review2_demo4.2_large_print.json#L7
2014-01-13T01:39:34 <jhernandez> I guess you mean magnifierEnabled
2014-01-13T01:39:42 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-01-13T01:41:02 <jhernandez> do you want me to create a pr of it?
2014-01-13T01:41:07 <kasparnet> jhernandez: indeed
2014-01-13T01:41:19 <kasparnet> and yes please
2014-01-13T01:41:25 <kasparnet> (to the review2 branch)
2014-01-13T01:42:07 <jhernandez> ACK
2014-01-13T01:42:12 <kasparnet> cheers javi
2014-01-13T01:45:05 <colinclark> kasparnet: So in terms of the Preferences Server and the few preferences sets that failed...
2014-01-13T01:45:09 <colinclark> Are you able to look at those?
2014-01-13T01:45:20 <colinclark> I\'m hoping for us to get to the point where avtar can take his leave from us
2014-01-13T01:45:30 <kasparnet> colinclark: yes, will do so now
2014-01-13T01:45:48 <colinclark> avtar: So both RBMM and STMM test out, as well as the OG Flow Manager
2014-01-13T01:45:59 <colinclark> is there anything else that you need us to test or worry about?
2014-01-13T01:46:02 <kasparnet> avtar: would you happen to still have the output telling which NP sets they are
2014-01-13T01:46:06 <colinclark> How did it go with Tony\'s stuff?
2014-01-13T01:46:18 <avtar> colinclark: it\'s still going
2014-01-13T01:46:43 <avtar> this took longer than i anticipated
2014-01-13T01:46:55 <avtar> but i\'ll wrap up his tasks tonight
2014-01-13T01:47:09 <avtar> kasparnet: ye
2014-01-13T01:47:09 <avtar> s
2014-01-13T01:48:54 <avtar> http://pastie.org/pastes/8627054/text
2014-01-13T01:48:57 <avtar> kasparnet ^
2014-01-13T01:49:13 <kasparnet> thanks - my log has been eaten at some point during all my disconnects tonight
2014-01-13T01:49:47 <colinclark> avtar: Is there anything I can do to help with Tony\'s stuff?
2014-01-13T01:50:30 <colinclark> Bosmon: If you have a free moment, can you submit a pull request to Andreas\' Statistical Matchmaker repository?
2014-01-13T01:51:11 <avtar> colinclark: nah, all good
2014-01-13T01:51:19 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T01:51:35 <avtar> i\'m going to go have dinner and then finish that
2014-01-13T01:53:34 <colinclark> cool, enjoy
2014-01-13T01:53:36 <kasparnet> avtar, colinclark: looks like it has to do with us using double backslash in those files
2014-01-13T01:53:40 <kasparnet> grep -l \'\\\\\' *
2014-01-13T01:53:40 <kasparnet> bak_review2_demo1.json
2014-01-13T01:53:40 <kasparnet> bak_review2_demo3b.json
2014-01-13T01:53:42 <kasparnet> os_win7.json
2014-01-13T01:53:44 <kasparnet> screenreader_nvda.json
2014-01-13T01:54:13 <kasparnet> (ok - my cygwin output aint pretty)
2014-01-13T01:54:27 <kasparnet> anyway - it\'s only in those 4 exact files
2014-01-13T01:57:58 <avtar> brb
2014-01-13T01:58:14 <kasparnet> colinclark, avtar: Considering that they\'re "just" backup sets (and standard sets we\'re not using for the review), I\'ll say that unless you have some straight forward magic up your sleeve, it\'s not something that is vital to fix tonight
2014-01-13T01:58:34 <kasparnet> I imagine we could always upload them with a little curl script or something
2014-01-13T01:58:53 <colinclark> kasparnet: Yes, that seems fine
2014-01-13T01:59:00 <colinclark> if we don\'t need them for the review, we won\'t sweat them
2014-01-13T01:59:16 <colinclark> and as you say, if you find yourself in a bind while doing the rehearsals tomorrow, you can just load \'em up via curl
2014-01-13T01:59:51 <colinclark> kasparnet: Do you think it\'s safe at this point to send out a status update telling people that the MMs are working awesomely?
2014-01-13T02:00:08 <yzen> Bosmon: yes
2014-01-13T02:00:16 <yzen> i can get to communicate to the server
2014-01-13T02:00:31 <yzen> but i have the issue with cookies still so thats what i m looking at
2014-01-13T02:00:40 <Bosmon> Oh cool
2014-01-13T02:00:47 <Bosmon> Have you tried the hosts file dodge?
2014-01-13T02:01:17 <yzen> Bosmon: i did i could not get it working just yet
2014-01-13T02:01:19 <Bosmon> hi colinclark - a pull request from my branch?
2014-01-13T02:01:44 <colinclark> Bosmon: yup, that\'s the version we have deployed currently
2014-01-13T02:01:52 <colinclark> so it might as well go back to its "main" repository
2014-01-13T02:02:00 <colinclark> to save you from having to be permanently responsible for it ;)
2014-01-13T02:02:17 <kasparnet> colinclark: well - we haven\'t tested them in windows yet - but yeah, it\'s a good idea
2014-01-13T02:02:24 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T02:02:34 <colinclark> I\'m just trying to save you the effort of having to explain stuff to people
2014-01-13T02:02:40 <colinclark> since I imagine you\'re pretty panicked doing the testing
2014-01-13T02:02:49 <kasparnet> perhaps just a mention that we have to run the tests
2014-01-13T02:03:07 <kasparnet> no, I agree, it\'s a good idea
2014-01-13T02:03:15 <kasparnet> and thanks
2014-01-13T02:08:47 <colinclark> yzen: I don\'t want to distract you if you\'re focusing. If it would help, I\'d be happy to listen to the issue you\'re facing with the cookie
2014-01-13T02:09:00 <yzen> colinclark: please :)
2014-01-13T02:09:09 <yzen> so i can now send socket messages
2014-01-13T02:09:13 <colinclark> great
2014-01-13T02:09:15 <yzen> but in order for them to fully work
2014-01-13T02:09:23 <yzen> i need a session established
2014-01-13T02:09:33 <yzen> it\'s done by logging in a user
2014-01-13T02:09:36 <colinclark> on the Flow Manager sever?
2014-01-13T02:09:38 <yzen> yes
2014-01-13T02:09:40 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T02:09:52 <yzen> and i do send the right headers afaik
2014-01-13T02:10:07 <yzen> Set-cookie
2014-01-13T02:10:18 <yzen> i see headers in the firebug
2014-01-13T02:10:21 <yzen> but they are not saved :(
2014-01-13T02:10:38 <colinclark> Can you easily send me an actual example of the headers you are sending?
2014-01-13T02:10:45 <yzen> well sure
2014-01-13T02:10:46 <colinclark> Does the problem occur equally in Chrome?
2014-01-13T02:10:54 <yzen> Set-Cookie\tkettle.sid=s%3AM0vevq7TE0bGi5qkovFSMO15.Zzu0c0Egvc5Crci8J2zShbwb%2BFb616iJz%2BT0slRJw%2Fw; Path=/; HttpOnly
2014-01-13T02:10:58 <yzen> for example
2014-01-13T02:12:33 <yzen> i was thinking the issue is that I\'m on localhost
2014-01-13T02:12:34 <colinclark> How is the cookie then used by the client?
2014-01-13T02:12:38 <colinclark> that\'s possible
2014-01-13T02:12:43 <colinclark> are you using a local Node.js server?
2014-01-13T02:12:46 <yzen> well it\'s just saved as a session cookie
2014-01-13T02:12:47 <colinclark> as Cindy and Justin recommended?
2014-01-13T02:12:48 <yzen> yes
'

b'2014-01-13T00:16:56 <colinclark> kasparnet: are you in the midst of pushing stuff to review2?
2014-01-13T00:17:14 <kasparnet> colinclark: sort of :S
2014-01-13T00:17:27 <colinclark> I was going to push https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/200/files
2014-01-13T00:17:35 <colinclark> but I don\'t know if i should wait for you to take care of yours?
2014-01-13T00:17:44 <colinclark> is everything ok, kasparnet?
2014-01-13T00:17:48 <kasparnet> nope - do it ... that one is the most important one
2014-01-13T00:17:58 <kasparnet> yeah - it\'s just device reporter and solution registry stuff
2014-01-13T00:18:00 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T00:18:01 <colinclark> here I go
2014-01-13T00:18:50 <kasparnet> colinclark: I\'m so fucking happy with the result of all the hard work you guys have done -- things are actually looking somewhat promising right now
2014-01-13T00:19:17 <colinclark> kasparnet: I\'m so fucking happy you are the voice of optimism right now
2014-01-13T00:19:24 <kasparnet> hehe
2014-01-13T00:19:29 <colinclark> as avtar can attest, things were looking pretty bleak a few hours ago
2014-01-13T00:19:35 <colinclark> so it\'s nice to hear some positive energy
2014-01-13T00:19:39 <avtar> ^ this
2014-01-13T00:20:02 <colinclark> ok kasparnet, avtar
2014-01-13T00:20:03 <colinclark> it\'s in
2014-01-13T00:20:23 <kasparnet> yay
2014-01-13T00:20:23 <colinclark> kasparnet: It\'s a flow manager, so can I just test it once avtar redeploys by doing the usual login thingy?
2014-01-13T00:20:36 <colinclark> i.e. flowmanager.gpii.net/user/sammy/login or whatever?
2014-01-13T00:20:44 <colinclark> is there a particular preference set that you recommend I test with?
2014-01-13T00:21:26 <kasparnet> colinclark: while not sure, I think due to the configuration being for a cloudbased flowmanager it might behave a bit special
2014-01-13T00:21:35 <kasparnet> I\'d start with testing:
2014-01-13T00:21:39 * kasparnet finding payload example
2014-01-13T00:22:22 <kasparnet> http://127.0.0.1:8081/carla/settings/{"OS":{"id":"linux"},"solutions":[{"id":"org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier"}]}   http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Flow_Manager_API
2014-01-13T00:22:32 <kasparnet> ooops
2014-01-13T00:22:41 <kasparnet> that last url is a reference to where I got the payload from
2014-01-13T00:22:58 <kasparnet> and obviously the 127.0.0.1:8081 should be replaced with flowmanager.gpii.net
2014-01-13T00:23:24 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T00:23:44 <colinclark> avtar: ping me up when you\'re ready for me to fire off this amazing command that kasper gave me
2014-01-13T00:23:51 <avtar> ok
2014-01-13T00:24:09 <colinclark> kasparnet: I\'m also super relieved to have Javi on the scene
2014-01-13T00:25:58 <kasparnet> yes, indeed! I\'ve just been out for a smoke with him
2014-01-13T00:26:52 <kasparnet> after having spent the weekend (and week for that matter) physically alone with this stuff, I needed some company to chat about the craziness of this sprint
2014-01-13T00:26:57 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-13T00:27:05 <colinclark> I\'m so sorry it\'s been so crazy for you
2014-01-13T00:27:08 <colinclark> and for everyone
2014-01-13T00:27:28 <kasparnet> yeah, everyone!!!
2014-01-13T00:34:29 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-01-13T00:45:35 <colinclark> crazy quotes
2014-01-13T00:54:33 <avtar> og matchmaker is online in proxy mode using the review2 branch
2014-01-13T00:55:11 <kasparnet> colinclark, avtar: jhernandez just tried some of the NP sets out on linux, and there are some good news and some bad news
2014-01-13T00:55:22 <colinclark> og
2014-01-13T00:55:25 <colinclark> kasparnet: ok
2014-01-13T00:55:28 <colinclark> what have you learned?
2014-01-13T00:55:42 <colinclark> what\'s the URL, avtar?
2014-01-13T00:55:43 <kasparnet> good news is that for one of the NP sets of test 1 (RB MM) things are working!!!! YAY
2014-01-13T00:55:52 <colinclark> wow
2014-01-13T00:55:53 <colinclark> awesome
2014-01-13T00:55:57 <kasparnet> Bad news is that the ST MM seems to be giving some problems
2014-01-13T00:56:15 <colinclark> ok, tell me about it
2014-01-13T00:56:44 <kasparnet> Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez: getting "connection refused" when using review2_demo3b_blind
2014-01-13T00:56:44 <kasparnet> Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez: looks like the stmm is not responding
2014-01-13T00:57:06 <kasparnet> colinclark: I\'m fixing up my windows machine right now and will test things as well
2014-01-13T00:57:16 <colinclark> hmm
2014-01-13T00:57:22 <colinclark> ok, let\'s take a look at this
2014-01-13T00:59:09 <avtar> colinclark: one sec, going to do the same for flowmanager
2014-01-13T00:59:21 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T01:02:05 <avtar> colinclark, kasparnet: does og matchmaker need to be reachable directly via the internet or does it only communicate with the flowmanager?
2014-01-13T01:02:15 <colinclark> just with the Flow Manager
2014-01-13T01:02:24 <avtar> ok
2014-01-13T01:02:46 <kasparnet> avtar: what is this "og" matchmaker you\'re talking about?
2014-01-13T01:02:49 * yzen joined the channel
2014-01-13T01:02:58 <avtar> kasparnet: the one in the universal repo
2014-01-13T01:03:03 <avtar> and not stmm or rbmm
2014-01-13T01:03:04 <kasparnet> ok
2014-01-13T01:03:11 <kasparnet> and why "og"
2014-01-13T01:03:33 <avtar> kasparnet: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OG
2014-01-13T01:03:46 <colinclark> avtar: I\'m getting the same error that jhernandez saw with the STMM
2014-01-13T01:03:48 <kasparnet> hahahaha, that\'s awesome avtar
2014-01-13T01:04:00 <colinclark> it seems to be ECONNREFUSEing us again
2014-01-13T01:04:17 <colinclark> NOBODY ECONNREFUSES KASPARNET!
2014-01-13T01:04:21 <avtar> does it matter that flowmanager is offline at the moment?
2014-01-13T01:04:36 <colinclark> It shouldn\'t, I don\'t think
2014-01-13T01:04:43 <kasparnet> nope - I agree - it shouldn\'t
2014-01-13T01:05:25 <colinclark> the rbmm is still responding well
2014-01-13T01:05:32 <colinclark> so I think the answer must be no
2014-01-13T01:05:49 <colinclark> and so speedily
2014-01-13T01:07:37 <avtar> colinclark: could you try it again?
2014-01-13T01:07:50 <colinclark> yup
2014-01-13T01:08:18 <colinclark> same result, avtar
2014-01-13T01:08:26 <colinclark> does it look like it\'s running from your end?
2014-01-13T01:08:37 <colinclark> and started in development mode and all that?
2014-01-13T01:08:49 <colinclark> Could it accidentally be in production mode?
2014-01-13T01:10:57 <jhernandez> c\'mon colinclark!!
2014-01-13T01:11:02 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-01-13T01:11:11 <jhernandez> android wants to use the stmm too
2014-01-13T01:11:13 <jhernandez> :)
2014-01-13T01:11:16 <colinclark> I know, I suck
2014-01-13T01:11:20 <colinclark> :(
2014-01-13T01:11:24 <avtar> colinclark: i will check in one sec
2014-01-13T01:11:27 <colinclark> thanks avtar
2014-01-13T01:11:30 <avtar> just about wrapping flowmanager stuff
2014-01-13T01:11:33 <colinclark> great
2014-01-13T01:11:38 <colinclark> I\'ll test it while you look at the STMM
2014-01-13T01:17:58 <avtar> colinclark: how about now?
2014-01-13T01:18:52 <colinclark> does this look sane to you, avtar?
2014-01-13T01:18:54 <colinclark> curl -X POST -d "@stmmpost.txt" http://stmm.gpii.net/match --header "Content-Type:application/json"
2014-01-13T01:19:08 <colinclark> I\'m still being ECONNREFUSED
2014-01-13T01:19:31 <avtar> k i\'ll stop stmm and start it from the command line
2014-01-13T01:19:59 <Bosmon> Hey there chaps
2014-01-13T01:20:02 <Bosmon> How\'s it going
2014-01-13T01:20:18 <colinclark> we\'re a bit back to where you were when you left
2014-01-13T01:20:28 <colinclark> the stmm seems to be not working again
2014-01-13T01:20:32 <colinclark> but hopefully its just some detail
2014-01-13T01:21:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: javi and kasper are here from the other side
2014-01-13T01:21:05 <colinclark> testing away
2014-01-13T01:21:05 <avtar> colinclark: what\'s in stmmpost.txt?
2014-01-13T01:21:23 <colinclark> i fabricated it, so it might be slightly wrong
2014-01-13T01:21:28 <colinclark> let me pastebin it
2014-01-13T01:21:33 <avtar> sure
2014-01-13T01:21:39 <avtar> i restarted it btw
2014-01-13T01:21:42 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-13T01:21:47 <Bosmon> It\'s working for me, avtar and colinclark
2014-01-13T01:21:51 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-01-13T01:21:53 <Bosmon> STMM
2014-01-13T01:21:58 <colinclark> http://pastebin.com/WPg4zLBg
2014-01-13T01:22:12 <colinclark> Bosmon: Do you still have the curl payload you were using for the STMM?
2014-01-13T01:22:19 <Bosmon> ECONNREFUSED will be a symptom of that misconfiguration yzen mentioned
2014-01-13T01:22:26 <avtar> colinclark, Bosmon: i\'m seeing activity now
2014-01-13T01:22:31 <colinclark> i.e. production mode, right Bosmon?
2014-01-13T01:22:34 <Bosmon> That is, the production config causing it to try to connect to the nonexistent ontology server
2014-01-13T01:22:37 <Bosmon> colinclark - right
2014-01-13T01:22:37 <colinclark> oh yes, it works now
2014-01-13T01:22:42 <avtar> colinclark: one sec
2014-01-13T01:22:46 <avtar> let me stop it again
2014-01-13T01:22:49 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-13T01:24:12 <avtar> colinclark: how about now?
2014-01-13T01:24:22 <colinclark> it\'s a thing of beauty
2014-01-13T01:24:27 <Bosmon> It\'s hardly that
2014-01-13T01:24:30 <Bosmon> But it is working
2014-01-13T01:24:33 <avtar> so wtf
2014-01-13T01:24:38 <colinclark> contextual vs. universal
2014-01-13T01:24:39 <avtar> all i did was restart the process
2014-01-13T01:24:58 <avtar> hmm
2014-01-13T01:24:58 <colinclark> in the context of 2:15 am in Luxembourg, it\'s a thing of rare beauty
2014-01-13T01:25:07 <jhernandez> sweet!
2014-01-13T01:25:13 <colinclark> jhernandez: can you try it?
2014-01-13T01:25:14 <jhernandez> android worked with the stmm
2014-01-13T01:25:17 <jhernandez> :)
2014-01-13T01:25:17 <Bosmon> What is the first hour at which someone will actually do a demo? : P
2014-01-13T01:25:18 <colinclark> FUCK YES
2014-01-13T01:25:22 <colinclark> YES YES YES
2014-01-13T01:25:31 <jhernandez> now trying on linux, but it should work too
2014-01-13T01:25:32 <jhernandez> :)
2014-01-13T01:25:40 <colinclark> oh thank goodness
2014-01-13T01:25:50 <colinclark> Bosmon: We have positive results of both MMs, then
2014-01-13T01:25:58 <avtar> gals and guys, could you try the other components as well?
2014-01-13T01:26:08 <Bosmon> colinclark - I guess that means that we will avoid a significant quantity of BLAME : P
2014-01-13T01:26:09 <avtar> flowmanager, og matchmaker, et all
