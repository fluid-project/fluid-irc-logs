2014-09-16T19:17:40 <slim> sgithens_: pong
2014-09-16T19:18:05 <sgithens_> slim! Sorry, I missed you last week.  Is your NFC stuff still ready for me to have a go with?
2014-09-16T19:18:45 <slim> sgithens_: yes, I did send an email out to the list. There is an exe.
2014-09-16T19:18:59 <sgithens_> cool, I'll go back and find it
2014-09-16T19:19:02 <slim> I will be doing installer tomorrow so you might want to wait a little longer.
2014-09-16T19:19:10 <sgithens_> did you want people to test building as well?
2014-09-16T19:19:46 <sgithens_> cool, are you doing it with WiX
2014-09-16T19:19:50 <slim> for review of pull req. But the exe is ready for a good thrashing. Check the readme.md
2014-09-16T19:20:02 <sgithens_> awesome
2014-09-16T19:20:08 <sgithens_> I'll check it out tonight
2014-09-16T19:20:35 <sgithens_> My head has been buried mostly in security and account work
2014-09-16T19:20:41 <slim> I wasn't do you think there is good reason right noe.  Isaw The Greeks used it so perhaps quite as bad as I imagined
2014-09-16T19:20:53 <sgithens_> but I'm starting to go back to the windows builds to start preparing another workable build
2014-09-16T19:21:09 <slim> I was goign to create an install.ex using Inno as familar with it and easy to use.
2014-09-16T19:21:14 <slim> NP being burried :)
2014-09-16T19:21:17 <sgithens_> that's probably fine
2014-09-16T19:21:25 <sgithens_> I will want to include it in my next LGS build though
2014-09-16T19:21:42 <slim> coo. Will do that now and look a Wix as second phase
2014-09-16T19:21:44 <sgithens_> so I'll need to add it to my fork of the GPII Wix installer
2014-09-16T19:22:06 <sgithens_> are there many components and options or is it literally just throwing the exe in a directory and making a shortcut?
2014-09-16T19:22:16 <slim> I though of a single installer to install one or both of USB & RFID listeners. What do you think?
2014-09-16T19:22:25 <sgithens_> Please
2014-09-16T19:22:28 <sgithens_> that would be great
2014-09-16T19:22:31 <sgithens_> both together
2014-09-16T19:22:47 <sgithens_> with that option to do one or both is great
2014-09-16T19:23:05 <slim> Cool. Not too many details I think. Just a couple of dependencies
2014-09-16T19:23:18 <sgithens_> awesome
2014-09-16T19:23:38 <sgithens_> can you post the Inno build schema or is it in a  weird binary format?
2014-09-16T19:23:46 <slim> That make installer bigger but easier to manage. And gives SysOps a choice to reduce the attack surface
2014-09-16T19:24:13 <sgithens_> I guess it's possible to post weird binary files :p
2014-09-16T19:24:19 <slim> In .ini files so declarative (inno == ini I guess
2014-09-16T19:24:24 <sgithens_> ah
2014-09-16T19:24:25 <sgithens_> cool
2014-09-16T19:24:29 <sgithens_> that's great
2014-09-16T19:24:33 <slim> will be part of source
2014-09-16T19:24:36 <slim> :)
2014-09-16T19:24:44 * clown_mtg has quit
2014-09-16T19:24:44 <sgithens_> fawesome
2014-09-16T19:25:24 <slim> I might also try gulp and grunt - I also wrote an email with Qs to list but no response. Any thoughts welcome
2014-09-16T19:25:29 <sgithens_> Have you looked at bundling node in projects yet, so that it uses it's own version?  I'm starting to look at that as well
2014-09-16T19:25:41 <sgithens_> sorry, I'll try and go back to your messages tonight
2014-09-16T19:25:45 <slim> no.
2014-09-16T19:25:52 <slim> must go now
2014-09-16T19:25:55 <slim> sorry
2014-09-16T19:26:00 <sgithens_> It doesn't look like it will be as hard as I thought
2014-09-16T19:26:01 <sgithens_> no worries
2014-09-16T19:26:07 <sgithens_> have a good evening Slim-san!
2014-09-16T19:26:15 <sgithens_> thanks much for the details
