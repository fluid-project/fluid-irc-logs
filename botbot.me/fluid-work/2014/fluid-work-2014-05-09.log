2014-05-09T14:15:28 <simonjb> hey Justin_o: I'm currently converting http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Subcomponent+Declaration which has code blocks in a table
2014-05-09T14:16:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb, it did and I was suitably embarassed.
2014-05-09T14:16:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I should have looked at the markup side by side first\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2014-05-09T14:18:22 <simonjb> Justin_o: I believe that I need to use HTML for the table and for the code block I'm using <pre><code>...</pre></code> -- but I don't see a way to get syntax highlighting -- have you hit this case yet? if so, what did you do?

2014-05-09T14:21:46 <simonjb> Justin_o: oops <pre><code>...</code></pre>
