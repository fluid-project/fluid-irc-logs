b"2014-08-21T19:55:15 <Bosmon7> I have merged up the FLUID-5497 one with FLUID-5475
2014-08-21T19:56:04 <michelled> ah, so 5475 should go in first?
2014-08-21T19:59:58 <Bosmon7> not really
2014-08-21T20:00:01 <Bosmon7> 5497 is the urgent one

2014-08-21T11:56:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  I reviewed the transcripts from yesterday to see if anyone had commented on monitoring for model changes.  By chance Cindy asked about something similar.   Is there a good example of a component that uses the modelListeners.modelChange construct she mentioned?
2014-08-21T11:57:12 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf, I\'ll mention it to cindyli when I see her.
2014-08-21T11:58:20 <the-t-in-rtf> All I need is something that uses the pattern she mentioned, it sounded like it was common, I just haven\'t run across one browsing through the repo yet.
2014-08-21T11:58:43 <the-t-in-rtf> modelListeners: {
2014-08-21T11:58:43 <the-t-in-rtf> \tmodelPath: {
2014-08-21T11:58:43 <the-t-in-rtf> \t\tlistener: "...",
2014-08-21T11:58:43 <the-t-in-rtf> \t\tnamespace: "..."
2014-08-21T11:58:43 <the-t-in-rtf> \t}
2014-08-21T11:58:44 <the-t-in-rtf> }
2014-08-21T11:59:46 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf: I\'ll pass that on. Unfortunately I won\'t be much help other than be a messenger. :)
2014-08-21T12:00:24 <the-t-in-rtf> nws, I was just hoping for a link while my monster find and grep is running against infusion, the preferences editor, etc.
2014-08-21T12:00:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I will hopefully answer it myself shortly
2014-08-21T12:00:32 <the-t-in-rtf> :P
2014-08-21T12:00:41 <jhung> lol
2014-08-21T12:02:55 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, not a big IRC fan, finally discovered the tab completion for names.  Thanks jhung and everyone else I have never managed to correctly mention until now.
2014-08-21T12:05:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Sigh.  Anyway, the only mention of modelPath in the whole of infusion\'s code base is in the tests, and it\'s not a helpful example for this case.  Do please ask around, a source link would be really helpful.
2014-08-21T12:05:37 <jhung> sure thing the-t-in-rtf.

2014-08-21T12:22:47 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf the text "modelPath" refers to your own model path, not to a name that should be used in the configuration

2014-08-21T12:45:50 <Bosmon> Please wait a few minutes and I should have a fix for your issue
2014-08-21T12:48:00 <cindyli> yay!. did you ever go to bed last night, Bosmon
2014-08-21T12:48:07 <Bosmon> eventually
2014-08-21T12:48:40 <cindyli> eventually, you can go to bed after 24 hrs non-stop working ;)

2014-08-21T14:51:30 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request for the media overlay stuff: https://github.com/fluid-project/EPUB/pull/2
2014-08-21T14:51:43 <jhung> excellent anastasiac, I\'ll take a look.
2014-08-21T14:52:14 <jhung> Also I updated my FLOE-225 branch anastasiac - you may want to merge that into your FLOE-215 branch
2014-08-21T14:53:09 <jhung> Oh. actually don\'t merge.
2014-08-21T14:53:30 <Bosmon> michelled, cindyli - my pull request is ready for the IoC testing issue you discovered last night
2014-08-21T14:53:31 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/555
2014-08-21T14:53:31 <jhung> I\'ll get this pull request in first.
2014-08-21T14:53:35 <Bosmon> Sorry it took so long
2014-08-21T14:53:51 <Bosmon> I found an unexpected test failure in the prefs framework builder framework at the last moment
2014-08-21T14:54:11 <cindyli> no worries. good to find it earlier than later
2014-08-21T14:54:14 <Bosmon> In theory it was unrelated, but it seemed to be not random in nature
2014-08-21T14:54:30 <Bosmon> But again stemmed from failure to specify priority: "last" in a listener fixture
2014-08-21T14:54:43 <Bosmon> This seems to be so common that I have made it the default for "new ChangeApplier listeners from IoC tests"
2014-08-21T14:55:17 <Bosmon> The effects of having the component tree destroyed under your feet by the IoC testing framework whilst you are partway through servicing a listener are pretty devastating
2014-08-21T14:55:29 <cindyli> Bosmon: does the pull request 555 contains the fix for "the unexpected test failure in the prefs framework builder framework"
2014-08-21T14:55:36 <Bosmon> cindyli, yes it does
2014-08-21T14:55:39 <Bosmon> You should see all tests passing
2014-08-21T14:55:42 <cindyli> cool
2014-08-21T14:55:45 <cindyli> trying now
2014-08-21T14:59:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - cheers - sorry to waste your yesterday with this problem
2014-08-21T14:59:34 <Bosmon> I know how pressed for time we are
2014-08-21T15:00:00 <cindyli> np. thanks for working hard to get this fixed, Bosmon. time for you to rest a bit
2014-08-21T15:00:17 <jhung> anastasiac: I left a comment in your pull request.
2014-08-21T15:00:25 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2014-08-21T15:00:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - no rest for the wicked... now I need to continue with what I was meant to be doing
2014-08-21T15:00:49 <Bosmon> Which was to get asynchronous settings handlers working in the GPII : P
2014-08-21T15:00:59 <cindyli> oh, man\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-08-21T15:01:08 <cindyli> or superman...
2014-08-21T15:01:27 <Bosmon> Unfortunately not
2014-08-21T15:01:36 <Bosmon> Otherwise you would not keep being plagued with these bugs
2014-08-21T15:01:37 <cindyli> that\'s no good
2014-08-21T15:01:43 <Bosmon> And this framework which is extremely hard to debug
2014-08-21T15:02:07 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-08-21T15:02:12 <cindyli> :\'( - that is for you
2014-08-21T15:02:31 <Bosmon> One day when we ACTUALLY get a rest, we\'ll be able to implement the constantly dreamed of authoring and debugging system
2014-08-21T15:02:42 <Bosmon> But until then we will just have to continue suffering with what we have
2014-08-21T15:03:01 <Bosmon> I should generally say that the framework\'s behaviour if you destroy a component partway through iterating over a list of listeners is not completely consistent
2014-08-21T15:03:38 <Bosmon> So you should make sure to only ever do this either from a "last" listener or when the system is "otherwise quiet" - e.g. directly from a UI listener
2014-08-21T15:03:43 <Bosmon> I know this is easier to say than to do
2014-08-21T15:03:50 <Bosmon> But it is an issue you should be aware of : P
2014-08-21T15:04:45 <Bosmon> A lot of our problems and hard to understand behaviour stem from test case fixture which have priorities which are not "last"
2014-08-21T15:04:58 <Bosmon> And we also have a further problem in that our listener priority system is itself not very sound
2014-08-21T15:05:19 * simonjb has quit
2014-08-21T15:06:35 <Bosmon> For example, the priority "last" might already be in use in the implementation, in which case it would be impossible for the testing framework to deterministically beat it
2014-08-21T15:06:47 <Bosmon> So, in general, we need to think harder
2014-08-21T15:07:33 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-08-21T15:07:47 <Bosmon> And before we think harder, we need to be careful ....
2014-08-21T15:10:22 <jhung> added another comment anastasiac - about the MP3 file.

2014-08-21T17:38:41 <jhung> ok that should be fine then. I\'ll merge this pull request anastasiac
