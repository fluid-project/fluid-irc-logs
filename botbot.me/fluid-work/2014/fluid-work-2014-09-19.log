2014-09-19T14:41:20 <cindyli> hi Bosmon8
2014-09-19T14:43:22 <cindyli> in the model relay "fluid.transforms.free" function, seems calling component invokers are not allowed. code:
2014-09-19T14:43:42 <cindyli> modelRelay: [{
2014-09-19T14:43:43 <cindyli> source: "isTooltipOpen",
2014-09-19T14:43:43 <cindyli> target: "isShareTarget",
2014-09-19T14:43:43 <cindyli> forward: "liveOnly",
2014-09-19T14:43:43 <cindyli> singleTransform: {
2014-09-19T14:43:43 <cindyli> type: "fluid.transforms.free",
2014-09-19T14:43:43 <cindyli> args: {
2014-09-19T14:43:44 <cindyli> "that": "{that}"
2014-09-19T14:43:44 <cindyli> },
2014-09-19T14:43:45 <cindyli> func: "gpii.metadata.feedback.isShareTarget"
2014-09-19T14:43:45 <cindyli> }
2014-09-19T14:43:46 <cindyli> }, {\xe2\x80\xa6}]
2014-09-19T14:44:03 <cindyli> gpii.metadata.feedback.isShareTarget = function (that) {
2014-09-19T14:44:03 <cindyli> var dialogOpener = that.getDialogOpener();
2014-09-19T14:44:03 <cindyli> \xe2\x80\xa6};
2014-09-19T14:45:04 <cindyli> getDialogOpener() is an invoker defined for "that". console.log(that) shows
2014-09-19T14:45:08 <cindyli> getDialogOpener  invokeInvoker()
2014-09-19T14:45:31 <cindyli> The error from this line:
2014-09-19T14:45:31 <cindyli> TypeError: that.getDialogOpener is not a function
2014-09-19T14:45:44 <cindyli> is this expected behavior?

2014-09-19T14:48:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: i submitted a pull request for FLOE-227. I\'ll start looking at FLOE-230 today.
2014-09-19T14:49:21 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Justin_o

2014-09-19T15:01:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking at FLOE-230 now.. what was the reason for the in transit.opinion model value
2014-09-19T15:03:58 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2014-09-19T15:04:41 <cindyli> Justin_o: transit.opinion is an intermediate value to translate the states of match and mismatch to the feedback central model
2014-09-19T15:05:27 <cindyli> the states of match and mismatch come from subcomponents bindMatchConfirmation & bindMismatchDetails
2014-09-19T15:05:37 <cindyli> the translation includes:
2014-09-19T15:05:48 * Bosmon8 has quit
2014-09-19T15:06:02 <cindyli> if bindMatchConfirmation.model.isActive is true, central model match === true
2014-09-19T15:06:34 <cindyli> if bindMismatchDetails.model.isActive is true, central model match === false && mismatch === true
2014-09-19T15:07:04 <Justin_o> how does it set match to false?
2014-09-19T15:07:26 <cindyli> using "fluid.transforms.arrayToSetMembership"
2014-09-19T15:07:44 <cindyli> the source array only has one element at any time
2014-09-19T15:08:10 <cindyli> one of these values: like, dislike, none
2014-09-19T15:09:23 <cindyli> in the first "if bindMatchConfirmation.model.isActive is true", as well, central model not only has match === true, also should have mismatch === false
2014-09-19T15:11:32 <Justin_o> okay, so if it doesn\'t match it will set the value to false, and true if it does
2014-09-19T15:25:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: what does forward: liveOnly mean
2014-09-19T15:25:16 <Justin_o> and is there docs for that somewhere
2014-09-19T15:29:17 <cindyli> Justin_o: means ignore "init
2014-09-19T15:29:19 <cindyli> "
2014-09-19T15:29:49 <Justin_o> cindyli:  thanks
2014-09-19T15:30:10 <cindyli> not sure if there\'s a doc for this, but certainly has a jira with explanations, Justin_o. looking up..
2014-09-19T15:30:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-09-19T15:30:58 <cindyli> Justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5371

2014-09-19T16:25:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m trying to do a transformation. i want it to replace an array in the model, but it seems to be merging instead. have you encountered that before?
2014-09-19T16:27:27 <cindyli> Justin_o: how do you replace it?
2014-09-19T16:27:53 <cindyli> i\'m coming
2014-09-19T16:53:40 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I updated my DOM Binder docs pull request based on today\xe2\x80\x99s feedback, and my Testing Framework docs pull request is ready for another review
