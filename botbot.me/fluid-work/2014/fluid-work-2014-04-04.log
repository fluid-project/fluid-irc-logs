b'2014-04-04T20:15:57 <Bosmon7> I may not be able to get round to it until Tuesday, since I am travelling back to the US now
2014-04-04T20:16:08 <Bosmon7> Thanks for the linting pulls, Justin_o
2014-04-04T20:16:32 <cindyli> ok, Bosmon7, happen travelling :)
2014-04-04T20:17:05 <cindyli> another thing, Bosmon7, to continue the discussion from yesterday that my customized inversion for "fluid.transforms.condition" does not happen when it\'s used in the model relay
2014-04-04T20:17:58 <cindyli> tried to look into the framework code but quite lost. wonder if you have some hints for me?
2014-04-04T20:19:02 <cindyli> the function registered in invertConfiguration does get triggered at the component instantiation but the inverse relay is happening at model change
2014-04-04T20:19:31 <Bosmon7> isn\'t happening?
2014-04-04T20:19:32 <cindyli> sorry, \xe2\x80\xa6 is NOT happening at the model change
2014-04-04T20:19:34 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-04-04T20:20:03 <Bosmon7> I guess the first key point is at DataBinding.js line 568
2014-04-04T20:20:15 <Bosmon7> YOu should check that this line executes and causes the appropriate inverse configuration to be generated
2014-04-04T20:20:43 <Bosmon7> After that you can then see about line 588 to see if the inverse transform actually ever triggers
2014-04-04T20:22:38 <cindyli> i did set the console log before 588, never gets there. checking 568
2014-04-04T20:24:08 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - the lint changes mostly look good but there are the odd areas where there seem to be whole-line changes but I can\'t tell what they are
2014-04-04T20:24:45 <Bosmon7> For example FluidView.js line 576 inside fluid.globalDismissal
2014-04-04T20:24:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: can you send me an example of one of those ases
2014-04-04T20:24:57 <Justin_o> thanks
2014-04-04T20:24:59 <Bosmon7> I don\'t seem to see any changes inside the whitespace which still seems to be spaces
2014-04-04T20:25:07 <Bosmon7> So I wonder if you could tell what you changed in those functions?
2014-04-04T20:25:40 <Bosmon7> Hopefully this URL is a direct link to one of those blocks
2014-04-04T20:25:41 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/490/files#diff-4b381c182ebd5016a846e5cb4f674389R576
2014-04-04T20:27:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m not exactly sure, but i\'d guess it was trailing whitespaces

2014-04-04T20:40:06 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - normally those show up explicitly in the diff view.....
2014-04-04T20:42:00 <cindyli> Bosmon7: line 568 in DataBinding.js does executed. the generated inverse configuration looks good. but 588 is not triggered at the model change. i think i will create a unit test to re-produce the issue in a cleaner environment and try from there
2014-04-04T20:42:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: if i\'m not mistaken, the diff for blocks don\'t show the specific areas that changed. You only get that for single line changes
2014-04-04T20:42:16 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-04-04T20:42:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: by the way, if you can supply me with the necessary comments for all the jshint ignore statements, i can add them to the pull request. you can either fork my branch or just drop comments on the pull request
2014-04-04T20:43:25 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - sure
2014-04-04T20:43:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks
2014-04-04T20:43:38 <Bosmon7> I feel that we can skip the requirement for an explanation of the use of the XOR operator
2014-04-04T20:43:51 <Bosmon7> It just happens to be the most appropriate way to express the logical construct we need there
2014-04-04T20:44:11 <Bosmon7> Any "explanation" could only consist of a list of all the other ways of expressing the condition and how atrocious they are : P
2014-04-04T20:44:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, please leave a comment there for me to remove the TODO if i left one in that spot
2014-04-04T20:44:58 <Bosmon7> Justin - thanks - I believe there are actually 2 such uses
2014-04-04T20:45:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon7:  if there is a concise reason though i could add it, but if not i\'ll just remove the todo
2014-04-04T20:45:31 * clown has quit
2014-04-04T20:45:42 <Bosmon7> I don\'t feel that an explanation there would really add anything for the reader - XOR is a perfectly reasonable logical operator : P
2014-04-04T20:45:50 <Justin_o> okay
2014-04-04T20:46:24 * cindyli has quit
2014-04-04T20:48:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon7:  here\'s the jshint documentation on why they are caught http://jshint.com/docs/options/#bitwise. If it\'s useful to explain why we didn\'t mean something else then please leave the info, if not please leave me a note on the line to remove the TODO
2014-04-04T20:48:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m heading out, but i\'ll look into your comments next week
2014-04-04T20:48:20 <Justin_o> thanks
2014-04-04T20:48:24 <Bosmon7> Ok - we can add a note that the use is at least deliberate : P
2014-04-04T20:48:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sure.. :)
2014-04-04T20:48:46 <Bosmon7> But I believe the prohibition against bitwise operators is just a Crockford shibboleth that we were happy to leave behind
2014-04-04T20:49:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: if that\'s the case perhaps we should change the jshintrc file and removing the jshint ignore lines
2014-04-04T20:49:54 <Bosmon7> ok, let\'s just double-check that on the list

2014-04-04T12:33:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello, are you there. i\'m looking at your changes for FLUID-5298
2014-04-04T12:33:26 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o - thanks for that
2014-04-04T12:33:47 <Bosmon7> I imagine that further issues will remain on Safari, but I would think that this would resolve a lot of them
2014-04-04T12:33:59 <Justin_o> so seems there is another issue in Fluid.js line 997
2014-04-04T12:33:59 <Bosmon7> Given this could easily be responsible for causing failures in most of our components in strict mode
2014-04-04T12:34:02 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-04-04T12:34:07 <Justin_o> listener is set to "fluid.moduleLayout.defaultOnShowKeyboardDropWarning"
2014-04-04T12:34:23 <Bosmon7> Oh yes
2014-04-04T12:34:30 <Bosmon7> Would you like to patch that one in the same way?
2014-04-04T12:35:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sure i\'ll give that a try.. so just wrapping it in an isPrimitive check
2014-04-04T12:35:30 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes
2014-04-04T12:38:02 <Justin_o> that seems to have gotten past there.. i\'m running the tests again.. seems like there are still failures.. i\'ll see if i can figure out what those are coming from
2014-04-04T12:38:41 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-04-04T12:42:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hmm.. i think those changes have resulted in tests failures.. i\'m seeing some in safari and firefo
2014-04-04T12:42:25 <Justin_o> firefox
2014-04-04T12:42:36 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - what guard did you write?
2014-04-04T12:43:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i changed line 997 to if (!listener.$$fluid_guid && !fluid.isPrimitive(listener)) {
2014-04-04T12:43:56 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - that strikes me as being the wrong way round
2014-04-04T12:44:07 <Justin_o> :) yes, i just noticed that myself
2014-04-04T12:44:09 <Bosmon7> Given it doesn\'t prevent the attempt to read a property which doesn\'t exist
2014-04-04T12:44:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: but the strict mode error happens when trying to assign a value, the values can be read in this fashion
2014-04-04T12:44:38 <Justin_o> so that error is still resolved
2014-04-04T12:44:46 <Justin_o> i\'ll flip them around though and let you know if the tests change
2014-04-04T12:45:09 <Bosmon7> It should be flipped round, since it\'s most likely perfectly within the rights of strict mode to fail on reads as well as writes
2014-04-04T12:45:26 <Bosmon7> Although it\'s interesting how inconsistently the vendors are interpreting the rules
2014-04-04T12:45:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes, it is.. by the way, the strict mode error is about assigning to read only properties.. so reading seems to be allowed
2014-04-04T12:46:05 <Bosmon7> It doesn\'t seem as if there is actually much value right now in adopting strict mode, although the situation may improve in future
2014-04-04T12:46:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: anyways.. it is more correct to flip them, so i did, but the tests are still failing :(
2014-04-04T12:46:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i think there is value, but these inconsistencies could lead to problems so we may need to be wary of them
2014-04-04T12:47:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i mean, i think we\'ve caught real issues with it
2014-04-04T12:49:09 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-04-04T12:54:55 <Bosmon7> Well, in theory they are real issues, but in practice we seem to have more issues now :)
2014-04-04T12:55:20 * anvk joined the channel
2014-04-04T12:55:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :) they are more visible now, which seems the goal of strict mode
2014-04-04T12:55:51 <Bosmon7> Well it\'s arguable what a "problem" is in JS, given that the real meaning of a construct is defined by what browsers do rather than by any real standard
2014-04-04T12:55:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the tests are failing in firefox with that change i made, so you should be able to see them
2014-04-04T12:56:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sure, but i can\'t imagine we really meant to be manipulating strings
2014-04-04T12:57:49 <Bosmon7> Yes, there is probably a small but positive value to enabling strict mode
2014-04-04T12:58:11 <Bosmon7> I\'d be happier about it if any of the vendors had shown evidence so far of using this to enable any optimisations

2014-04-04T13:26:15 <Justin_o> jhung: just wanted to check what state the metadata designs are in.. are they ready for implementation?
2014-04-04T13:27:20 <jhung> The designs for the demo iteration 2 are ready Justin_o. I\'ve been working on the markup.
2014-04-04T13:28:19 <Justin_o> jhung: oh okay.. which jira is that?
2014-04-04T13:28:33 <Justin_o> and does that mean you\'ll hand over all the markup needed for us to just plug the js into?
2014-04-04T13:29:23 <jhung> Justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-178
2014-04-04T13:30:10 <jhung> Justin_o: Maybe cindyli, you and I should have a quick chat to coordinate?
2014-04-04T13:32:30 <Justin_o> jhung: sounds good.. cindyli is away from her desk at the moment, but after she comes back maybe we can do a quick check in
2014-04-04T13:32:55 <jhung> sure Justin_o
2014-04-04T13:38:23 <Justin_o> jhung, cindyli: would you like to have a quick Skype check in for metadata?

2014-04-04T19:44:26 <jhung> simonjb, anastasiac: I\'ve figured out what is causing the problem with the overviewPanel still behaving like it is there when it isn\'t. It appears that the overviewPanel container doesn\'t have a \'hidden" style, so it maintains a width of 24em.
2014-04-04T19:45:04 <jhung> the solution unfortunately isn\'t straight-forward, but at least I think it can be done all in CSS.
2014-04-04T19:45:12 <anastasiac> jhung, nice work

2014-04-04T20:09:56 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli
2014-04-04T20:10:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ve filed two new pull requests for FLUID-5284 you can see the links from the comment on the jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5284
2014-04-04T20:10:10 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon7
2014-04-04T20:10:11 <Bosmon7> About your recent pull request - isn\'t it the case that we have never had ChangeApplier support for removing array elements?
2014-04-04T20:10:56 <cindyli> Bosmon7: if so, how to get around this problem?
2014-04-04T20:11:31 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I believe you ought to be able to get the change enacted from the end holding the booleans?
2014-04-04T20:12:14 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon7
2014-04-04T20:12:18 <cindyli> but not at the array side
2014-04-04T20:13:54 <cindyli> i mean the change is reflected at the end that holds the booleans, but not reflected to the array end
2014-04-04T20:14:17 <Bosmon7> cindyli - ah, I see - you mean you flip one of the booleans, but the opposite array does not change?
2014-04-04T20:14:27 <cindyli> exactly, Bosmon7
2014-04-04T20:14:30 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-04-04T20:14:38 <Bosmon7> I guess we ought to be able to fix that : P
2014-04-04T20:14:53 <cindyli> yay! thanks, Bosmon7
