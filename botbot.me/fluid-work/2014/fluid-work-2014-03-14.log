2014-03-14T19:07:25 <jhung> Justin_o: In order to use <strong> we also need the Bold version of Roboto Slab. I was thinking of changing to a web font instead of using local copies. Any thoughts on that?
2014-03-14T19:08:46 <jhung> Justin_o: actually we already have Roboto slab bold locally. Not sure why it isn't showing up when using <strong>. I'll have to take a closer look.
2014-03-14T19:08:57 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2014-03-14T19:09:00 <Justin_o> that's strange
2014-03-14T19:16:22 <jhung> Justin_o: I've updated the pull request
2014-03-14T19:17:18 * michelled joined the channel
2014-03-14T19:18:14 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-03-14T19:20:33 <Justin_o> jhung: did you make the other fonts smaller?
2014-03-14T19:20:44 <Justin_o> sorry, the other text
2014-03-14T19:21:09 <Justin_o> the text for the video url, restart button and etc. all look smaller
2014-03-14T19:22:26 <Justin_o> i think chaining from OpenSans-regular to just OpenSans has caused this.. do you see it as well
2014-03-14T19:22:28 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2014-03-14T19:22:56 <jhung> Mine looks okay Justin_o. Let me dump my cache since FF doesn't like font changes.
2014-03-14T19:24:45 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. let me i'll try to do that too
2014-03-14T19:25:24 <Justin_o> jhung: oh i think the font is missing
2014-03-14T19:25:31 <Justin_o> i'm getting a 404 on it
2014-03-14T19:25:40 <Justin_o> jhung: did you miss committing something?
2014-03-14T19:25:47 <jhung> Justin_o: mine still looks okay. Although a styling bug I fixed earlier has reappeared in FF. When you resize to smaller, boostrap's 15px margins appear to left and right of our editor.
2014-03-14T19:25:51 <jhung> Justin_o: let me check
2014-03-14T19:26:40 * jhung smacks head
2014-03-14T19:26:55 <jhung> helps if I wasn't looking at the live demo Justin_o.
2014-03-14T19:26:57 <jhung> :/
2014-03-14T19:26:59 <jhung> lol
2014-03-14T19:28:02 <Justin_o> jhung: lol
2014-03-14T19:28:06 <Justin_o> i do that too
2014-03-14T19:28:32 <jhung> Justin_o: pushed up a change.
2014-03-14T19:28:40 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks :) i'll try again

2014-03-14T19:43:07 <jhung> Justin_o: great. Now is it time we bring the burnt offerings to avtar?
2014-03-14T19:43:07 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, now is the time
2014-03-14T19:43:07 <Justin_o> :)
2014-03-14T19:43:07 <jhung> I hope I do it right this time. I'm still a bit sore from the lightning strike last time.

2014-03-14T14:52:36 <jhung> Justin_o: I have a question about adding some new behaviour for the current metadata demo. :)
2014-03-14T14:53:14 <Justin_o> jhung: sure, what\'s up
2014-03-14T14:53:56 * michelled joined the channel
2014-03-14T14:54:25 <jhung> Justin_o: I would like the user to be able to press "OK" on the text input field and the demo would just "work". i.e. by pressing "OK" without inputing a value, we would supply some default URL.
2014-03-14T14:55:58 <jhung> I\'ve forwarded you and email with two images as a reference to what I\'m thinking Justin_o.
2014-03-14T14:58:07 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. thanks for the e-mails, we should probably surface that to list or the wiki at some point.. what did you have in mind for the default value?
2014-03-14T14:59:19 * Bosmon has quit
2014-03-14T15:00:59 <jhung> Justin_o, the current placeholder text would be fine as a default value. Also this was a request from Jutta that we give the demo some additional instructions. I\'m open to other suggestions on how this might be accomplished.
2014-03-14T15:01:34 <jhung> my thinking is to give the simplest path to getting a demo user to seeing the "good stuff".

2014-03-14T15:46:48 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. i guess this is related to that pull request you asked me to review at standup. In terms of the video though we should make sure that the user knows which format to use in which browser. Otherwise the preview won\'t show up properly.

2014-03-14T17:32:22 <jhung> Justin_o: I just checked - it appears it works for both browsers.

2014-03-14T17:32:59 <Justin_o> jhung: it doesn\'t work for safari only chrome
2014-03-14T17:33:37 <jhung> Is there a format that universally supported Justin_o?
2014-03-14T17:34:41 <Justin_o> jhung: not that i know of.. i\'ll take another look
2014-03-14T17:35:52 <jhung> Justin_o: thanks. Ideally we would like to give an URL for users to use in case the URL they used isn\'t valid.
2014-03-14T17:36:39 <Justin_o> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video
2014-03-14T17:37:02 <Justin_o> if you scroll down to the browser support section, mp4 is pretty widely supported with the exception of Firefox on certain platforms
2014-03-14T17:38:11 <jhung> Justin_o: that chart makes me sad. lol
2014-03-14T17:38:29 <Justin_o> jhung: here\'s another one http://caniuse.com/mpeg4

2014-03-14T17:41:07 <Justin_o> jhung: unless you want to do some browsers detection, but that will make things a bit more complicated
2014-03-14T17:41:14 <Justin_o> and potentially error prone
2014-03-14T17:41:29 <jhung> Yeah. let\'s just do the text route for now Justin_o. Simpler.

2014-03-14T18:24:28 <jhung> yes Justin_o.
2014-03-14T18:24:39 <Justin_o> jhung: in firefox?
2014-03-14T18:24:44 <jhung> yep.
2014-03-14T18:25:23 <jhung> actually webm works in both browsers Justin_o. I should update that error message to just have that URL.
2014-03-14T18:26:13 <Justin_o> jhung: it doesn\'t work in safari so you should keep that :)
2014-03-14T18:26:23 <Justin_o> jhung: but it\'s also not working in firefox for me :(
2014-03-14T18:27:29 * jhung goes into the corner and quietly sobs.
2014-03-14T18:27:33 <Justin_o> jhung: it won\'t even open if i put the url directly in the browsers address field
2014-03-14T18:27:49 <Justin_o> jhung: is it working fine for you? is it just my setup somehow?
2014-03-14T18:28:02 <jhung> let me confirm again Justin_o.
2014-03-14T18:28:23 <jhung> Yep works for me Justin_o. Going to check Windows FF in case.
2014-03-14T18:29:18 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-03-14T18:29:27 <jhung> works on Windows FF too Justin_o.
2014-03-14T18:29:42 <jhung> just to confirm we\'re talking about this URL, right? http://build.fluidproject.org/videoPlayer/demos/videos/Mammals/Mammals.webm
2014-03-14T18:29:46 <jhung> ^Justin_o
2014-03-14T18:29:58 <Justin_o> jhung: yep
2014-03-14T18:43:03 <Justin_o> jhung: any luck?
2014-03-14T18:43:29 <jhung> everything is fine on my end Justin_o
2014-03-14T18:44:27 <Justin_o> jhung: and you are trying it through the metadata demo and not just directly through the browser\'s address bar?
2014-03-14T18:45:04 <jhung> yes Justin_o
2014-03-14T18:45:37 <Justin_o> jhung: hmm.. i wonder why it\'s not working for me..
2014-03-14T18:47:28 <jhung> which version of FF are you running Justin_o?
2014-03-14T18:47:41 <jhung> I\'m using 27.0.1
2014-03-14T18:49:26 <Justin_o> jhung: same
2014-03-14T18:50:53 <Justin_o> jhung: weird... it\'s working now
2014-03-14T18:51:04 <Justin_o> jhung: i think it was having trouble connecting to the build site
2014-03-14T18:51:56 <jhung> hmmm. Justin_o. Good to know.
