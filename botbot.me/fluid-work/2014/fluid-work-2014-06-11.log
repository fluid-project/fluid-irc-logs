b'2014-06-11T19:32:20 <clown> just to be clear:  I\'m working on his first comment "\xe2\x80\xa6we should ensure that these files are lintable using jshint and, for example, the infusion .jshintrc \xe2\x80\xa6"
2014-06-11T19:32:26 <clown> (for now).
2014-06-11T19:32:46 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-06-11T19:33:02 <clown> all right, then.
2014-06-11T19:33:07 <jhernandez> :)
2014-06-11T19:33:24 <jhernandez> btw, will you have time to meet tomorrow?
2014-06-11T19:34:37 <jhernandez> basically, it\'s about device reporter plugins + the requirements we\'ve collected so far about it
2014-06-11T19:35:23 * clown checks calendar
2014-06-11T19:35:59 <clown> jhernandez:  the only thing in my calendar is the gnome-a11y meeting.  Otherwise I am free.
2014-06-11T19:36:28 <jhernandez> cool
2014-06-11T19:37:23 <jhernandez> then I\'ll try to ping you early in *your* morning - let\'s say *my* 15:00
2014-06-11T19:37:42 <jhernandez> one hour before the a11y meeting
2014-06-11T19:38:34 <clown> that would be 9am my time.  I can guarantee that I will be here by 9:15am  (your 15:15)
2014-06-11T19:38:44 <jhernandez> ok, no prob
2014-06-11T19:38:58 <clown> it\'s really a six hour difference?  I thought was 5 hours.
2014-06-11T19:39:12 <clown> you are an hour later that London (England)?
2014-06-11T19:39:18 <jhernandez> the point is that probably I\'ll be on a meeting tomorrow at 17:00
2014-06-11T19:39:19 <jhernandez> heh
2014-06-11T19:39:20 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-06-11T19:39:31 <jhernandez> like Portugal
2014-06-11T19:39:51 <clown> Right, you are in Belgium (?)
2014-06-11T19:39:54 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-06-11T19:40:26 <clown> Okay, I\'ll try to be earlier, but more likely 9:15
2014-06-11T19:40:30 <clown> I\'ll look for you here.
2014-06-11T19:41:14 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-06-11T19:41:16 <jhernandez> no problem
2014-06-11T19:41:20 <jhernandez> :)
2014-06-11T19:41:22 <jhernandez> and thanks
2014-06-11T19:41:27 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-06-11T19:43:42 <clown> you\'re welcome.

2014-06-11T14:05:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have any thoughts on this http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5387
2014-06-11T14:07:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it takes forever to run the tests, but i think it is an issue with tests being run more times than they should be and some cases where tests from one suite get run in another.. this happened for some of the preferences framework tests that share some test grades
2014-06-11T14:09:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, we have a timing issue in the IoC testing framework that will be hard to resolve without a fix to qunit
2014-06-11T14:09:14 <Bosmon> I don't think that the commit you have referenced there is responsible
2014-06-11T14:09:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so it may have just been a coincidence?
2014-06-11T14:10:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: from what you are saying, i take it that it is not reasonable to hold up the release for this. is that correct?
2014-06-11T14:11:15 <Bosmon> I quite often see random test failures even on other browsers, especially if the machine is slow
2014-06-11T14:11:39 <Bosmon> Yes, we should carry on to ship the release
2014-06-11T14:11:51 <Bosmon> I'm working on FLUID-5397 today which you reported, thanks for the report
2014-06-11T14:15:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks so much
2014-06-11T14:18:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, did you see this issue http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5394
2014-06-11T14:19:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I did
2014-06-11T14:19:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: michelled had said you had looked at it before and had made a fix.. i wonder if this is a regression or if your fix didn't make it in?
2014-06-11T14:19:37 <Bosmon> I will be trying to resolve that at the same time as FLUID-5397
2014-06-11T14:19:49 <Bosmon> Yes, I had made a fix to this but I see it has reappeared
2014-06-11T14:19:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great thanks
2014-06-11T14:20:03 <Bosmon> This may be a result of the jQuery UI upgrade

2014-06-11T15:55:32 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled
2014-06-11T15:55:39 <michelled> hi Bosmon
2014-06-11T15:55:43 <michelled> how are things?
2014-06-11T15:55:43 <Bosmon> I had a question about the new OverviewPanel that we are using for our demos
2014-06-11T15:55:48 <Bosmon> They are pretty good!
2014-06-11T15:55:53 <Bosmon> ***THER CATTT*** is snuzing next door
2014-06-11T15:56:06 <michelled> what a good CATTT!
2014-06-11T15:56:16 <michelled> what is your question?
2014-06-11T15:56:33 <Bosmon> michelled - you mentioned that the panel is only meant to appear when first loading the page
2014-06-11T15:56:41 <Bosmon> but I can't seem to find the code responsible for this feature
2014-06-11T15:56:44 <Bosmon> Can you point me to it?
2014-06-11T15:57:40 <michelled> oh, my terrible memory - I don't remember saying that. was it related to the close option of the panel?
2014-06-11T15:58:03 <Bosmon> michelled - that is a separate issue
2014-06-11T15:58:30 <Bosmon> anastasiac - do you remember anything about the feature whereby the overview panel was meant to only appear once per demo?
2014-06-11T15:59:13 <anastasiac> no, that doesn't sound at all familiar. It might be that it should remember closed state on page reload...
2014-06-11T15:59:22 <Bosmon> anastasiac - yes, sure
2014-06-11T15:59:26 <Bosmon> Do we have code for that?
2014-06-11T15:59:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that's only in the metadata demo
2014-06-11T16:01:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/html/index.html
2014-06-11T16:02:43 * clown joined the channel
2014-06-11T16:02:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ah, thanks for the link
2014-06-11T16:03:10 <Bosmon> Do we have a JIRA or other plans for adding this as a core feature of the base component?
