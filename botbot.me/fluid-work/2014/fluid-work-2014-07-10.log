2014-07-10T13:25:01 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-07-10T13:25:20 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - the first performance test is making tests of the performance of the very simplest configuration of fluid.get which is one of the most performance-critical parts of the framework
2014-07-10T13:26:00 <Bosmon> The second performance test is testing the performance of fast versus "slow" invokers which were introduced for FLUID-4922

2014-07-10T13:54:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok

2014-07-10T15:23:41 <Justin_o> clown_mtg: could you help me sanity check something.. basically if an element on a web page is only for mouse interaction. It\'s basically used as a button. Keyboard users have alternate means of using the same feature, but we do not want them to use the same buttons as the mouse user. In this case should we leave off all aria attributes from the elements
2014-07-10T15:23:41 <Justin_o> used for mouse clicks?
2014-07-10T15:29:36 <cindyli> vjoanna: do you have the color code for feedback demo icons? for hover, active, status of metadata: available, unavailable, partially available etc?
2014-07-10T15:29:50 * clown_mtg is now known as clown
2014-07-10T15:29:58 <clown> Justin_o:  Wha?
2014-07-10T15:30:36 <clown> Justin_o:  aria is not for keyboard access \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s orthoganol.  Aria is for A11y APIs.
2014-07-10T15:31:21 <clown> just because the button is only accessed via mouse doesn\'t mean it shouldn\'t have a representation in the a11y tree.
2014-07-10T15:32:15 * clown tries to wrap his head around a button that can *only* be used with the mouse...

2014-07-10T18:36:19 <cindyli1> sure, Justin_o
2014-07-10T18:38:49 <cindyli1> Justin_o: in this pull request, the links, including the links to other demos, are still pointing to "src" dir. shall they be removed.
2014-07-10T18:40:14 <cindyli1> and, opening the links with "src" embedded automatically redirects to the links without "src"
2014-07-10T18:44:46 * jhung has quit
2014-07-10T18:46:29 <Justin_o> cindyli1: there\'s an issue with the redirects that we need avtar to fix
2014-07-10T18:46:39 <Justin_o> basically src is redirecting back up to infusion
2014-07-10T18:46:51 <Justin_o> which is breaking all the links to the js
2014-07-10T18:47:09 <Justin_o> cindyli1: oh the links are pointing to src/demos?
2014-07-10T18:47:17 <Justin_o> i guess i should change that
2014-07-10T18:47:24 <Justin_o> thanks for catching that
2014-07-10T18:47:34 <cindyli1> np. let me know
2014-07-10T18:47:39 <cindyli1> when it\'s ready

2014-07-10T18:54:38 <Bosmon7> Justin_o, anastasiac - I was just pointing the-t-in-rtf at some of our new documentation
2014-07-10T18:54:50 <Bosmon7> And I noticed that one of the pages linked to from here doesn\'t seem to have been converted yet
2014-07-10T18:54:51 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/ComponentOptionsAndDefaults.md
2014-07-10T18:55:05 <Bosmon7> On this page there is a link to ComponentConfigurationOptions.md which doesn\'t exist
2014-07-10T18:55:10 <Bosmon7> Do we have a plan for that page?
2014-07-10T18:55:15 * michelled has quit
2014-07-10T18:57:14 <anastasiac> Bosmon7, in your review your comment on that page was "should probably be rethought." I think our current plan is to leave that page out for now, in which case we should remove the link in the markdown that links to it
2014-07-10T18:57:43 <Bosmon7> Well, it seems based on this conversation that the page is more useful than I supposed
2014-07-10T18:57:52 <Bosmon7> Given it was almost the first one that the-t-in-rtf asked for
2014-07-10T18:58:19 <Bosmon7> We might want to consider a straight conversion of the markup from the existing page, even if it ends up being non-ideal
2014-07-10T19:00:08 <anastasiac> Bosmon7, sounds good. I\'ll add it to the list of "pages to do" and create a JIRA for it. Thanks
2014-07-10T19:00:19 <Bosmon7> Thanks, anastasiac
2014-07-10T19:01:03 <Bosmon7> It\'s rare we get direct feedback from our users to guide our documentation process :)

2014-07-10T19:32:39 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - the recent directory restructuring has broken our module definition file fluid.js for use with node.js
2014-07-10T19:32:50 <Bosmon8> It seems that the relative paths in devIncludes.json are now no longer correct
2014-07-10T19:33:04 <Bosmon8> I\'ll issue a pull in a sec
2014-07-10T19:33:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: yes.. simonjb just spotted that too.. i\'m just about to commit a fix and send a pull request
2014-07-10T19:33:15 <Bosmon8> oh ok great
2014-07-10T19:33:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: ah.. did you want to file the pull request.. or should i send mine?
2014-07-10T19:33:34 <Bosmon8> the-t-in-rtf just ran into it trying to use node-jqUnit
2014-07-10T19:33:39 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - do send yours if you started already
2014-07-10T19:33:49 <Bosmon8> I just got as far as characterising the issue : P
2014-07-10T19:33:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: okay.. it\'ll be ready soon. :)
