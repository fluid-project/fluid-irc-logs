b'2014-11-08T16:49:09 <Bosmon> I only see normal quotes from you in gchat
2014-11-08T16:49:29 <colinclark> how about "no"
2014-11-08T16:49:30 <colinclark> "now"
2014-11-08T16:49:34 <colinclark> am I "smart" quoting?
2014-11-08T16:49:39 <Bosmon> They are now normal quotes
2014-11-08T16:49:42 <colinclark> great
2014-11-08T16:49:50 <colinclark> the text is so small in this client that i can\'t even really tell
2014-11-08T16:49:52 <colinclark> I guess I\'m getting old
2014-11-08T16:50:16 <Bosmon> Yes, Apple is a young man\'s company
2014-11-08T16:50:24 <Bosmon> Which of us could even resolve "retina display" text : P
2014-11-08T16:50:36 <colinclark> I had always accused you of this
2014-11-08T16:50:44 <colinclark> with your insanely high resolution displays
2014-11-08T16:50:49 <Bosmon> I think that 144 ppi will be my limit for life
2014-11-08T16:50:56 <Bosmon> Clearly my eyesight is never going to get better than this
2014-11-08T16:51:15 <colinclark> I was at least easily able to bump the size up in this client
2014-11-08T16:51:21 <colinclark> but desktops need to be more like web
2014-11-08T16:51:24 <Bosmon> The new Nexus 9 has got mixed reviews
2014-11-08T16:51:26 <colinclark> if the web is even good at it :P
2014-11-08T16:51:39 <Bosmon> But its screen was generally praised as running neck and neck with the iPad Air
2014-11-08T16:51:58 <colinclark> interesting
2014-11-08T16:52:15 <colinclark> At this point I\'m still pretty unconvinced by tablets
2014-11-08T16:52:26 <colinclark> my ipad\'s biggest strength seems to be video conferencing
2014-11-08T16:52:27 <Bosmon> Other than that it was criticised for having tangibly flimsy construction, an unusable power switch and glitchy task switching
2014-11-08T16:52:34 <colinclark> but I think I\'d rather have a tiny laptop than a tablet
2014-11-08T16:52:46 <colinclark> Lenovo apparently has an ARM-based chromebook coming out that will be $150
2014-11-08T16:52:49 <Bosmon> Yes, my Nexus worked very well for linking us with sbates
2014-11-08T16:52:54 <colinclark> it did
2014-11-08T16:52:59 <Bosmon> And similarly your ipad at SD
2014-11-08T16:53:03 <colinclark> yup
2014-11-08T16:53:09 <colinclark> especially now that we have VIDYO
2014-11-08T16:53:14 <Bosmon> VIDDYYO!!!
2014-11-08T16:53:28 <colinclark> Our portal doesn\'t yet seem to be delivering the web client
2014-11-08T16:53:33 <colinclark> which I believe is WebRTC based
2014-11-08T16:53:56 <colinclark> The Chromebook just received an .exe file when I went to the portal\'s page :(
2014-11-08T16:56:49 <colinclark> Bosmon: Is this not a bug? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/559/files#diff-ce65b74e18811491f3cd6be95ac827b6R160
2014-11-08T16:57:02 <colinclark> since the signature of makeEventFirer has changed
2014-11-08T16:57:47 <Bosmon> Oh yes, thanks
2014-11-08T16:57:56 <Bosmon> "good catch", as they say : P
2014-11-08T16:58:38 <Bosmon> What crusty old stuff FluidRequests.js is....
2014-11-08T17:01:28 <Bosmon> ok, fixed and pushed
2014-11-08T17:29:08 <colinclark> Bosmon: I don\'t actually see your new commit in this pull request
2014-11-08T17:29:13 <colinclark> Am I doing something dumb?
2014-11-08T17:29:30 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/559/commits
2014-11-08T17:29:39 <Bosmon> I see it

2014-11-08T17:32:33 <colinclark> :(
2014-11-08T17:32:56 <colinclark> thanks
2014-11-08T17:36:46 <Bosmon> no worries
2014-11-08T17:36:56 <Bosmon> Ok, windows repo pulls are looking reasonably good
2014-11-08T17:37:02 <Bosmon> I\'ll turn to updating linux now ....
2014-11-08T17:45:59 <jhernandez> Bosmon: if you want me to test something ... I\'ll be around
2014-11-08T17:46:19 <Bosmon> ***VERNNANDDEZZ***!!!!!!
2014-11-08T17:48:05 <jhernandez> *IT\'S MEEE!*
2014-11-08T18:03:13 * heidiv has quit
2014-11-08T18:22:04 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I\'m still not sure about this one
2014-11-08T18:22:04 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/45
2014-11-08T18:22:17 <Bosmon> Is the reason that the acceptance test didn\'t need updating was that it was broken before?
2014-11-08T18:31:02 <colinclark> hey jhernandez!
2014-11-08T18:31:18 <colinclark> Bosmon: Do you actually want to log this? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/559/files#diff-32f2240088b9658bb96609fbfe0d1fdcR32
2014-11-08T18:36:32 * kasparnet has quit
2014-11-08T18:39:14 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, very much
2014-11-08T18:39:38 <Bosmon> Although the message in the later branch is rather more helpful
2014-11-08T18:40:19 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/562/files#diff-32f2240088b9658bb96609fbfe0d1fdcR32
2014-11-08T18:41:10 <Bosmon> I find it gives a rather more regular and reassuring air to application startup ......
2014-11-08T18:41:36 <Bosmon> Especially compared to earlier versions of our system that would begin by logging "[Function function]"
2014-11-08T18:51:36 <colinclark> But do we really want unmutable logging in any app that uses the Infusion module?
2014-11-08T18:52:12 <colinclark> ah, sorry
2014-11-08T18:52:18 <colinclark> I see the later modification you pasted
2014-11-08T18:52:54 <Bosmon> Yes, the later version can be defeated by setting the logging level sufficiently high
2014-11-08T18:53:23 <Bosmon> I can backport the line to this branch if you\'d like
2014-11-08T18:53:38 <colinclark> nope, that\'s fine
2014-11-08T18:54:06 <colinclark> if this were the last pull to be merged before a release, i\'d say yes
2014-11-08T18:54:34 <colinclark> but really, if I just keep "doing my fucking job" we\'ll get this all in
2014-11-08T18:55:10 <Bosmon> linux repo is running with the new branches!
2014-11-08T18:55:17 <Bosmon> Just fireballing a few more PUL requests.....

2014-11-08T19:14:08 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yup
2014-11-08T19:14:19 <Bosmon> hi jhernandez
2014-11-08T19:14:26 <jhernandez> that was part of some kasper\'s work on acceptance tests
2014-11-08T19:14:26 <Bosmon> XRANDR unit tests are failing for me
2014-11-08T19:14:40 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-11-08T19:15:02 <jhernandez> are you virtuualizing linux?
2014-11-08T19:15:20 <jhernandez> perhaps it\'s a video card-related issue
2014-11-08T19:17:10 <jhernandez> or is it a different issue?
2014-11-08T19:17:12 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2014-11-08T19:17:13 <Bosmon> It\'s in a VM
2014-11-08T19:17:19 <Bosmon> jhernandez - look familiar? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b64ec2bc40e65f8a8f2a
2014-11-08T19:17:40 <jhernandez> nnope
2014-11-08T19:18:46 <jhernandez> and, as I\'ve just said, looks like a video card-like issue, not sure
2014-11-08T19:19:28 <jhernandez> what virt tech are u using? qemu/kvm, vbox, vmware ... ?
2014-11-08T19:19:33 <Bosmon> VMWare
2014-11-08T19:20:32 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-08T19:20:42 <jhernandez> just ran xrandr\'s tests
2014-11-08T19:20:46 <jhernandez> 20:19:48.032:  jq: All tests concluded: 10/10 total passed in 7645ms - PASS
2014-11-08T19:22:04 <jhernandez> I\'ll try to reproduce it under a virtual fedora

2014-11-08T19:34:56 <Bosmon> hi jhernandez - orca settings handler is still faulty
2014-11-08T19:35:29 <Bosmon> It assumes that it only ever acts for one solution and that it is called "org.gnome.orca"
2014-11-08T19:38:55 <Bosmon> Could you issue a similar fix for it as is in https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/45 ?
2014-11-08T19:39:00 <Bosmon> Actually we have standard utilities for this now
2014-11-08T19:39:04 <Bosmon> You can use this one: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-434/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/settingsHandlerUtilities.js#L118
2014-11-08T19:40:48 <Bosmon> You can see an example usage here
2014-11-08T19:40:49 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/windows/blob/GPII-434/gpii/node_modules/registrySettingsHandler/src/RegistrySettingsHandler.js#L273
2014-11-08T19:41:15 <Bosmon> Can you update your pull request so that acceptance tests pass against these branches? (my GPII-434 of universal and linux)
2014-11-08T19:45:33 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ACK

2014-11-08T10:51:02 <jhernandez> added "DA TEST"
2014-11-08T10:52:18 <jhernandez> BUT, found out that we\'re still corrupting the file
2014-11-08T10:54:24 <jhernandez> after a full get/set flow, and by having requested "voice.default.rate": 100, we\'re ending with
2014-11-08T10:54:34 <jhernandez> "voices": {
2014-11-08T10:54:34 <jhernandez> "default": {}
2014-11-08T10:54:36 <jhernandez> }
2014-11-08T10:55:04 <jhernandez> am I doing something wrong?
2014-11-08T10:56:08 <jhernandez> the code and the test case are already included into https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/59
2014-11-08T11:53:12 <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes, I feared this would happen
2014-11-08T11:53:20 <Bosmon> We can write a utility to make it go away
2014-11-08T11:53:33 <Bosmon> But we should check whether orca cares about the corruption first
2014-11-08T12:02:36 * Bosmon7 has quit
2014-11-08T12:29:41 <jhernandez> well, orca it\'s ok - it doesn\'t care about that, after a login/logout pass it starts fine

2014-11-08T15:51:56 <colinclark> hey Bosmon
2014-11-08T15:52:02 <Bosmon> Hey there colinclark
2014-11-08T15:52:25 <colinclark> Your comment on the FLUID-5506 pull request
2014-11-08T15:52:31 <colinclark> "moved to full "options" model even though it increases our object count per event by 1.\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-11-08T15:53:01 <colinclark> this means another object that will be garbage collected after the event is fired?
2014-11-08T15:53:16 <Bosmon> colinclark - well, when it is constructed
2014-11-08T15:53:21 <Bosmon> The costs during use should be the same
2014-11-08T15:53:31 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T15:53:47 <colinclark> So, in most use cases, an extra object per event at component construction time?
2014-11-08T15:54:18 <Bosmon> colinclark - probably in every use case
2014-11-08T15:54:23 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T15:54:32 <Bosmon> Also, it is closed over, so it will live as long as the event
2014-11-08T15:54:37 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T15:54:40 <colinclark> so it won\xe2\x80\x99t be collected
2014-11-08T15:54:51 <colinclark> it\xe2\x80\x99s just a widening of our memory footprint
2014-11-08T15:54:55 <Bosmon> yes
2014-11-08T15:55:02 <colinclark> I appreciate notes about things like this in your pull request, it helps to contextualize
2014-11-08T15:55:24 <Bosmon> It seemed worth it since our signature to makeEventFirer had been becoming really obnoxious
2014-11-08T15:55:57 <Bosmon> But even the 1 extra object is worth noting, since the framework constructs so many event firers
2014-11-08T15:56:04 <colinclark> yup
2014-11-08T15:56:14 <colinclark> I think it\xe2\x80\x99s both worth it and worth noting
2014-11-08T15:56:20 <Bosmon> I remember providing the "lazy initialization" in the CSpace days of 2010 provided a quite measurable performance boost
2014-11-08T15:56:32 <Bosmon> Which deferred the construction of at least 3 objects until the firer was actually used
2014-11-08T15:57:07 <Bosmon> The great majority of events are actually never listened to at all, and just live and die

2014-11-08T15:57:38 <Bosmon> A great metaphor for our citizenry : P
2014-11-08T15:58:25 <colinclark> lol
2014-11-08T15:58:29 <colinclark> yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s true
2014-11-08T15:58:33 <colinclark> hey there\xe2\x80\x99s kasparnet
2014-11-08T15:58:46 <Bosmon> There might be
2014-11-08T15:58:51 <Bosmon> He\'s been coming and going all afternoon
2014-11-08T15:59:12 <colinclark> ah
2014-11-08T15:59:58 <colinclark> Okay, so based on the comment at the bottom of this pull request, it\xe2\x80\x99s here to for review purposes but I\xe2\x80\x99ll actually have to merge the FLUID-5513 branch
2014-11-08T16:02:42 <Bosmon> Well let me try updating it to master
2014-11-08T16:02:47 <Bosmon> I was a bit confused when I made that comment
2014-11-08T16:06:48 <Bosmon> Oh I see.... looks like I made some changes to the packaging from my other machine
2014-11-08T16:09:23 <Bosmon> colinclark - ok, it should merge cleanly now
2014-11-08T16:09:27 <colinclark> oh cool
2014-11-08T16:09:27 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T16:09:29 <colinclark> fluid.invokeLater
2014-11-08T16:09:33 <colinclark> izs would be proud :P
2014-11-08T16:09:51 <Bosmon> hahaha
2014-11-08T16:09:59 <Bosmon> Not only that, the Swing developers would be proud : P
2014-11-08T16:10:18 <Bosmon> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html#invokeLater(java.lang.Runnable)
2014-11-08T16:13:04 <colinclark> setTimeout(func, 0) isn\xe2\x80\x99t sufficient to ensure it is invoked on, as izs would say, \xe2\x80\x9cthe next run-to-completion?\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-11-08T16:13:37 <colinclark> you\xe2\x80\x99re using a 1 ms delay in your implementation at the moment, Bosmon
2014-11-08T16:22:47 <Bosmon> colinclark - I believe on some platforms the 0ms delay isn\'t effective
2014-11-08T16:22:49 <Bosmon> Let me check again...
2014-11-08T16:22:53 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T16:23:05 <colinclark> Interestingly, it looks like most browsers still clamp the minimum value
2014-11-08T16:23:11 <colinclark> which is really awful for this purpose
2014-11-08T16:23:24 <Bosmon> yes
2014-11-08T16:23:35 <Bosmon> I guess this is why when.js includes a "scheduler"
2014-11-08T16:23:57 <Bosmon> But whilst we have this clamp, I consider that deferred programming should be absolutely minimised on the browser
2014-11-08T16:24:08 <Bosmon> Right now we use it primarily for structuring our IoC-driven tests
2014-11-08T16:24:46 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T16:24:54 <colinclark> What an insane situation
2014-11-08T16:24:59 <Bosmon> I\'m happy to change it to 0
2014-11-08T16:25:01 <Bosmon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8341803/difference-between-settimeoutfn-0-and-settimeoutfn-1
2014-11-08T16:25:10 <colinclark> both Mozilla and Google refuse to implement setImmediate
2014-11-08T16:25:27 <colinclark> setTimeout is probably clamped at somewhere between 2 and 8 ms depending on the browser
2014-11-08T16:26:07 <colinclark> the HTML5 spec apparently requires this minimum 4 ms clamping
2014-11-08T16:26:38 <colinclark> or used to
2014-11-08T16:26:51 <Bosmon> Now it is much more confusing
2014-11-08T16:27:16 <Bosmon> It\'s unclear to me what it means by a "nested timer"
2014-11-08T16:27:27 <Bosmon> Wow, some intensely dramatic dark clouds have blown up
2014-11-08T16:29:46 <colinclark> Oddly I had never heard of this technique: http://dbaron.org/log/20100309-faster-timeouts
2014-11-08T16:30:06 <colinclark> but the demo page does seem to show that it\xe2\x80\x99s much faster
2014-11-08T16:30:13 <Bosmon> yes, me neither
2014-11-08T16:30:18 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting we should change
2014-11-08T16:30:21 <Bosmon> I had just got to the same point myself via
2014-11-08T16:30:26 <colinclark> mdn
2014-11-08T16:30:27 <Bosmon> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout#Minimum.2F_maximum_delay_and_timeout_nesting
2014-11-08T16:30:29 <colinclark> yup
2014-11-08T16:30:29 <Bosmon> yes
2014-11-08T16:31:20 <Bosmon> My view is that "async programming is only suitable for lightweight use" given today\'s platforms, and perhaps even tomorrow\'s
2014-11-08T16:31:40 <Bosmon> Especially if we are planning for a world in which thousands of promises may have to resolve per second
2014-11-08T16:32:09 <colinclark> terrifying
2014-11-08T16:32:55 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-11-08T16:33:56 <Bosmon> Well, the exact way the world will look when we have the "wave of promises" implementation still isn\'t completely sharp in my mind
2014-11-08T16:34:07 <Bosmon> But I think it is pretty clear we will have "quite a few" promises : P
2014-11-08T16:36:23 <Bosmon> wow
2014-11-08T16:36:26 <Bosmon> Had you seen this API?
2014-11-08T16:36:27 <Bosmon> http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-page-visibility-20110602/
2014-11-08T16:39:41 <colinclark> I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it
2014-11-08T16:40:04 <colinclark> I have had to do some weird things in Flocking to do with the fact that an \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible\xe2\x80\x9d page doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean an \xe2\x80\x9cinaudible\xe2\x80\x9d page
2014-11-08T16:40:10 <Bosmon> :)
2014-11-08T16:40:23 <colinclark> I run all my timers in Web Workers
2014-11-08T16:40:31 <colinclark> since they are not throttled when a tab is inactive
2014-11-08T16:41:02 <colinclark> Though it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter, LoDash\xe2\x80\x99s defer function is implemented like yours, using setTimeout with a 1 ms delay.
2014-11-08T16:41:39 <Bosmon> I guess it is helpful as a warning to the reader that "You shouldn\'t expect this timeout to execute particularly quickly"
2014-11-08T16:42:27 <colinclark> I suppose so
2014-11-08T16:46:07 <colinclark> Is there anything but the courtesy of going slow that prevents us from removing the old change applier at this point, Bosmon?
2014-11-08T16:46:22 <Bosmon> colinclark - it\'s UIOptions
2014-11-08T16:46:29 <colinclark> what part of it?
2014-11-08T16:46:32 <Bosmon> All of it
2014-11-08T16:46:37 <colinclark> It just needs updating?
2014-11-08T16:46:39 <Bosmon> Is still currently bound to the old ChangeApplier
2014-11-08T16:46:39 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-11-08T16:46:49 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-08T16:47:05 <Bosmon> I found a nice Unicode-aware monospaced font that lets me see your "smart quottes" :)
2014-11-08T16:47:14 <Bosmon> You must have changed client recently
2014-11-08T16:47:16 <colinclark> oh shoot
2014-11-08T16:47:18 <colinclark> am I smart quoting?
2014-11-08T16:47:21 <Bosmon> You are
2014-11-08T16:47:23 <colinclark> I reformatted my machine
2014-11-08T16:47:33 <Bosmon> But now I can see them properly
2014-11-08T16:47:36 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure I turned smartquotes off somehwere
2014-11-08T16:47:39 <colinclark> now I have to figure out where
2014-11-08T16:47:53 <colinclark> do I smart quote only here, or everywhere?
2014-11-08T16:48:07 <Bosmon> I guess I\'ll be able to see all kinds of funny alphabets now
2014-11-08T16:48:14 <Bosmon> Although probably not Chinese which would have been the most helpful
2014-11-08T16:48:19 <colinclark> what font is it?
2014-11-08T16:48:29 <Bosmon> http://www.fixedsysexcelsior.com/
2014-11-08T16:49:04 <Bosmon> It looks like it is only here
