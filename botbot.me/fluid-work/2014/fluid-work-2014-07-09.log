2014-07-09T19:53:03 <Justin_o> :( that happens to me all the time.. it also happens with regular keys
2014-07-09T19:53:10 <Justin_o> at least for me
2014-07-09T19:53:16 <clown> :-( only two attempts?  You guys are lucky.
2014-07-09T19:53:26 <cindyli1> Justin_o: i made a comment on ur FLOE-198 branch for a minor change. Just wanna clean up the code a bit before merging it into other branches.
2014-07-09T19:53:30 <Bosmon2> jessm - yes, amazingly this seems to be well-known
2014-07-09T19:53:57 <Bosmon2> And implies that, like certain subatomic particles, USB cables are actually embedded in a space with a larger number of dimensions than ours
2014-07-09T19:54:07 <jessm> there is a gremlin in USBs
2014-07-09T19:54:16 <Bosmon2> electrons, for example, need to be rotated through 720 degrees before they look the same : P

2014-07-09T19:54:58 <Justin_o> cindyli1: thanks.. i made the change
2014-07-09T19:55:03 <Bosmon2> Oh yes, there it is :)

2014-07-09T20:08:37 <anastasiac> cindyli1, one final comment on your pull request
2014-07-09T20:09:03 <cindyli1> thanks, anastasiac, working on it
2014-07-09T20:14:02 <cindyli1> anastasiac: done and pushed up. also remove the links for where "UI Enhancer" appears since we know it won\'t be converted.
2014-07-09T20:14:09 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli1
2014-07-09T20:14:19 <cindyli1> np
2014-07-09T20:16:12 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks.. i\'ll probably take a look at those tomorrow
2014-07-09T20:18:57 <Justin_o> cindyli1:  do you know where the classnameMap is used now for UIO
2014-07-09T20:22:09 <jhung> anastasiac: do you have time tomorrow morning to help me with a UIO issue related to the Outside-In website?
2014-07-09T20:22:53 <anastasiac> jhung, sure
2014-07-09T20:24:59 <cindyli1> Justin_o: classnameMap is used by text font and contrasts to map btw the item value and css
2014-07-09T20:25:47 <Justin_o> cindyli1: i think we don\'t have a way to pass those in for UI Options, just for the preferences framework since they are configured in the schema
2014-07-09T20:26:47 <cindyli1> right, Justin_o, for UIO might be problematic.

2014-07-09T13:29:52 <Justin_o> cindyli:  thanks.. oh :( i bet i made that pull request against the wrong branch..
2014-07-09T13:30:18 <Justin_o> it was supposed to be against the 1.5.x branch, but it needed to go into both anyways.
2014-07-09T13:30:22 <Justin_o> i\'ll file another pull request
2014-07-09T13:31:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: can you review this one as well
2014-07-09T13:31:40 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/542
2014-07-09T13:32:07 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o

2014-07-09T13:32:27 <cindyli> np
2014-07-09T13:33:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve also updated my FLUID-5217 branch with master
2014-07-09T13:33:29 <cindyli> ya, saw it, Justin_o
2014-07-09T13:34:05 <cindyli> is infusion-1.5.x currently an equivalent of 1.5.0 tag?
2014-07-09T13:35:39 <cindyli> if so, merging other commits in there will cause the mismatch btw this branch and the actual 1.5.0 release, Justin_o
2014-07-09T13:36:48 <cindyli> would it make more sense for this commit to go into 1.5.1 branch, Justin_o
2014-07-09T13:37:05 <cindyli> well, which is our master branch, isn\'t it?
2014-07-09T13:37:28 * jessm joined the channel
2014-07-09T13:37:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: Infusion-1.5 is a tag where Infusion-1.5.x is a branch
2014-07-09T13:37:46 <Justin_o> the master is work towards 2.0
2014-07-09T13:38:12 <Justin_o> you can think of a tag as an alias or name for a specific revision

2014-07-09T13:47:06 <amilchev> hi cindyli1, quick one: how can I make the adjusters render with specific values, regardless of values in primarySchema? For instance, if default value of fontSize is 12, but I want to render the adjuster with 20?
2014-07-09T13:47:51 <Justin_o> cindyli1:  did you see my reply about the 1.5.x branch?

2014-07-09T13:49:47 <cindyli1> amilchev: off the top of my head, change the corresponding model value, which would not be easy to do without knowing the model path
2014-07-09T13:50:13 <cindyli1> amilchev: what\'s ur use case for this?
2014-07-09T13:52:54 <Justin_o> cindyli1: i was saying that Infusion-1.5 is a tag, Infusion-1.5.x is a branch. master contains 2.0 work
2014-07-09T13:52:56 * clown joined the channel
2014-07-09T13:53:55 <cindyli1> oh, ok, did you see my reply, Justin_o, i somehow was disconnected for a moment.
2014-07-09T13:53:56 <cindyli1> "infusion-1.5.x could cherry pick commits from the master or it may even contain commits that are not in the master?"
2014-07-09T13:54:20 <Justin_o> cindyli1: yes.. it may contain commits that aren\'t in master
2014-07-09T13:54:29 <cindyli1> got it. thanks, Justin_o
2014-07-09T13:54:52 <Justin_o> cindyli1: this will become more likely after the directory restructuring and as we start to remove backwards compatibility and etc.
2014-07-09T13:55:20 <cindyli1> ok, Justin_o
2014-07-09T14:00:43 <amilchev> cindyli1: don\'t know if you saw the email from Michelle with the meeting notes from yesterday, it\'s about the MM sending data like {term:"http://registry.gpii.org/common/screenreader/volume", value:"20"} and PCP rendering the adjusters accordingly
2014-07-09T14:01:36 <amilchev> cindyli1: as you perhaps recall, I\'m ready with rendering specific adjusters, now I just want to set specific values to each of them (regardless of primarySchema deafaults)
2014-07-09T14:01:40 * scott_gonzalez joined the channel
2014-07-09T14:03:28 <cindyli1> i see, amilchev, let me think about it. Justin_o, thoughts?
2014-07-09T14:05:43 <cindyli1> amilchev: is the value 20 only for the initial rendering?
2014-07-09T14:06:55 <amilchev> cindyli: um..what else could it be for? not sure if I get ur question
2014-07-09T14:07:18 <Justin_o> cindyli1, amilchev: i\'m guessing it\'s similar to what would happen if you retrieved the values from the store?
2014-07-09T14:08:10 <cindyli1> amilchev: it could be that the adjuster has been rendered but it needs to respond to MM returned 20
2014-07-09T14:10:15 <amilchev> cindyli1: no, there is no time between the rendering of the adjuster and setting it to value 20 :)
2014-07-09T14:10:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeah, had same thoughts
2014-07-09T14:12:07 <cindyli1> cool, a MM store
2014-07-09T14:12:22 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m thinking that pcp might use a different store, or at least fetch the initial values from the matchmaker instead. Since these should be the same anyways.. although we need to be careful about what gets stored back into the preferences server
2014-07-09T14:13:06 <Justin_o> cindyli1: this would be the more interesting version http://www.mmsworld.com
2014-07-09T14:13:44 <cindyli1> haha, like that

2014-07-09T14:40:06 <amilchev> Justin_o: how is the model returned from gpiiStore\'s \'get\' method later used to set the corresponding values in the adjusters that PCP renders?
2014-07-09T14:40:15 <amilchev> Justin_o: https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L222
2014-07-09T14:43:49 <amilchev> Justin_o: or should I not worry about that but just make sure I call gpiiStore\'s "get" but assure it\'s getting from the appropriate url (instead of the prefs server (perhaps pass url to get method?))
2014-07-09T14:51:50 <Justin_o> amilchev: i believe this is what happens.
2014-07-09T14:51:51 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L218
2014-07-09T14:52:25 <Justin_o> which is in turn used https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L356
2014-07-09T14:52:41 <Justin_o> so making sure the get method returns the correct values should probably be enough

2014-07-09T15:22:21 <anastasiac> good question, Justin_o. I don\'t know that we actually have an existing "best practice." What\'s the use case, and what do you recommend?
