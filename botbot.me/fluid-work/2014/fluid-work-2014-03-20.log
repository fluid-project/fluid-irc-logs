2014-03-20T17:27:35 <Justin_o> we haven\'t exactly settled on who will mentor this project but hopefully i can help with some of your questions
2014-03-20T17:27:36 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'m back from lunch.  I\'ve deleted (closed) the original pull request.
2014-03-20T17:28:17 <Justin_o> karan10: in regards to the pictures, you\'ll probably want to search google or some pre-existing database. this should be easily configurable though.
2014-03-20T17:29:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: would it be a hassle for you, if i update infusion in my FLOE-116 pull request.. seems like several of the changes that bosmon has recommended require a newer version
2014-03-20T17:31:20 <cindyli> Justin_o: that should be fine. go ahead
2014-03-20T17:31:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. thanks
2014-03-20T17:31:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry.. if there are a lot of conflicts
2014-03-20T17:33:27 <cindyli> Justin_o: i guess it would be a lot of conflicts. wonder if it would be easier if i remove the whole infusion lib before merging in ur branch
2014-03-20T17:33:50 <karan10> Justin_o: hi, Like if we search for a word, the process of searching in google images (or other database) to be run in background, and show one or two pictures from google images to the infusion interface.
2014-03-20T17:33:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think you\'d just take my changes
2014-03-20T17:34:05 <Justin_o> if you remove the lib it might also cause a conflict with the delete commit
2014-03-20T17:34:20 * SonicX has quit
2014-03-20T17:34:22 <Justin_o> karan10: yes, something like that sounds about right
2014-03-20T17:34:50 <Justin_o> vjoanna: did you have any thoughts on how the interaction for the picture dictionary would be
2014-03-20T17:35:49 <cindyli> Justin_o: the easiest would be doing it in my branch. but if you have to, will figure out a way to solve conflicts
2014-03-20T17:36:49 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes i think the easiest would be to do it in yours too.. i was asking bosmon about this.. maybe we just leave it like that unless he really wants all those things changed ahead of time
2014-03-20T17:37:01 <cindyli> ok
2014-03-20T17:40:35 <karan10> Justin_o: But what If same word have different meaning, like for ex. we search for "Mouse", it shows more images of computer mouse rather then an animal mouse. And how It\'d it select which image matches with our query.
2014-03-20T17:45:57 <vjoanna> Justin_o, karan10: Yes that sounds right - the images would have to be creative commons licensed . To get more accurate results other keywords within the resource could be used to filter the images.

2014-03-20T19:07:04 <karan10> Justin_o, vjoanna: Now, I got some understanding about the project. We can filter the google\'s image search result which shows only "labled for non commercial reuse with modification" so there will no copyright issues.

2014-03-20T19:09:22 <karan10> Justin_o, vjoanna: I am started working on proposal, what are the things that must be in my proposal to make it effective and any necessary suggestions?
2014-03-20T19:10:43 <karan10> *I am started working
2014-03-20T19:11:04 <karan10> *I started working
2014-03-20T19:12:30 <Justin_o> karan10: for starters make sure to try to follow the application format when writing up your proposal. Also keep in mind the project description. You\'ll need to be working with Fluid Infusion and building a client side tool to display the images and etc. and you\'ll also need someway of searching for those images. All the pieces should be configurable and
2014-03-20T19:12:30 <Justin_o> modular.

2014-03-20T19:23:51 <Justin_o> karan10: thanks, looking forward to seeing your proposal. At this point you should probably just post it straight up to the google-melange site

2014-03-20T19:28:15 <Justin_o> karan10: for sure, but you can update it on the google site if need be. If you don\'t get it up there in time you won\'t be able to apply.
2014-03-20T19:30:09 <karan10> Justin_o: thanks, I\'ll make sure to submit it by today within time. :)

2014-03-20T10:22:09 <karan10_> hi
2014-03-20T10:22:40 <jhernandez> welcome, btw
2014-03-20T10:22:42 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-20T10:23:30 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-03-20T10:24:36 <jhernandez> re your question
2014-03-20T10:25:34 <karan10_> I need guidance how to install infusion.
2014-03-20T10:25:57 <jhernandez> in order to install it, since infusion is based up on node.js, you can install all its dependencies and make it ready to work by running: npm install
2014-03-20T10:26:44 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-20T10:27:22 <karan10_> are you student ?
2014-03-20T10:27:29 <jhernandez> nope
2014-03-20T10:27:43 <karan10_> mentor ?
2014-03-20T10:27:47 <jhernandez> nope
2014-03-20T10:28:18 <jhernandez> let\'s say that I am just a user of infusion
2014-03-20T10:28:21 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-20T10:28:45 <jhernandez> but at a very high level
2014-03-20T10:29:10 <karan10_> okeh, how do I install its dependencies, sorry i am new. I have cloned the git repo. Now what step should I follow ?
2014-03-20T10:29:29 <jhernandez> cd into the folder and run, npm instal
2014-03-20T10:30:04 <jhernandez> it is assumed that you have node.js installed on your computer
2014-03-20T10:31:34 <jhernandez> maybe, you should start reading all the information from https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/README.md
2014-03-20T10:32:25 <jhernandez> also, you can read more about infusion on http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/
2014-03-20T10:32:35 <karan10_> okeh, thanks :)

2014-03-20T14:37:17 <jhernandez> no problem
2014-03-20T14:37:50 <jhernandez> ... wondering if you saw my mail
2014-03-20T14:38:55 <clown> yes, I saw one from yesterday.
2014-03-20T14:38:57 <jhernandez> maybe the root of the problem is my rebase of deviceReporterBridge branch on top of master
2014-03-20T14:39:12 * clown checking to see if you sent one since.
2014-03-20T14:39:39 <jhernandez> I had to forced it to push the new history
2014-03-20T14:40:03 <clown> jhernandez:  the last email is about you half-applying my format-patch.
2014-03-20T14:40:07 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-20T14:40:11 <jhernandez> that\'s it
2014-03-20T14:40:26 <clown> "maybe the root of the problem is my rebase of deviceReporterBridge"  Sure, let\'s blame you.  :-)
2014-03-20T14:40:40 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-20T14:41:00 <clown> Anyhow, right now, if I issue a pull request, it looks like it will include changes dating back to Oct 29, 2012.
2014-03-20T14:41:20 <jhernandez> I confess, sometimes, I like to be the centre of the attention
2014-03-20T14:41:22 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2014-03-20T14:41:27 <jhernandez> and I break things

2014-03-20T14:41:55 <jhernandez> mmmm
2014-03-20T14:41:59 <jhernandez> strange
2014-03-20T14:43:48 <clown> Well, I just made the pull request just to see what happens...
2014-03-20T14:44:12 * clown looks for email.
2014-03-20T14:44:33 <clown> nothing here.  Did you get anything?

2014-03-20T14:45:32 <clown> the pull request lists only "two changed files", and they are the correct ones.
2014-03-20T14:45:36 <clown> Maybe this worked?
2014-03-20T14:45:53 <jhernandez> yeah, it should work
2014-03-20T14:46:45 <clown> If you haven\'t received notification, this is what I\'m looking at:  https://github.com/klown/linux/compare/javihernandez:packagekitBridge...packagekitBridgeTests?expand=1
2014-03-20T14:47:18 <jhernandez> just curious
2014-03-20T14:48:16 <clown> yes?
2014-03-20T14:48:20 <jhernandez> why are you using your packagekitBridgeTests for the pull request?
2014-03-20T14:49:07 <jhernandez> the diff looks good to me, but the git history is missing a few commits
2014-03-20T14:49:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: I\'ve commented on all your open pull requests.
2014-03-20T14:50:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: in regards to GPII-669 i\'m still seeing styling issues with the cloud icon.. so please look into that.. and there are  some other comments there too

2014-03-20T14:51:41 <clown> oh, phooey.
2014-03-20T14:52:17 <clown> "why are you using your packagekitBridgeTests for the pull request" I think I forgot to switch to the correct branch locally...
2014-03-20T14:52:57 <clown> jhernandez, here is a paste of my local "situation":  http://pastebin.ca/2668181
2014-03-20T14:54:18 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-20T14:54:19 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-03-20T14:54:32 <clown> it looks like switched to my local packagekitBridgeTests instead of packagekitBridge when I merged the latest work.
2014-03-20T14:54:40 * clown swears at himself.
2014-03-20T14:55:29 <jhernandez> hahaha

2014-03-20T14:55:54 <jhernandez> what if you switch to your packageKitBridgeGetPkgs branch
2014-03-20T14:56:01 <jhernandez> then you run a:
2014-03-20T14:56:30 * clown waits patiently
2014-03-20T14:56:39 <jhernandez> git fetch -v javihernandez && git rebase javihernandez/packageKitBridge
2014-03-20T14:57:11 <clown> before I do that, let me paste the log of packageKitBridgeGetPkgs ...\t
2014-03-20T14:57:16 <jhernandez> (if i\'m not wrong) after that, things should be fine
2014-03-20T14:57:21 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-03-20T14:57:43 <clown> just the first 3 entries...
2014-03-20T14:58:46 <clown> http://pastebin.ca/2668182
2014-03-20T14:59:12 <jhernandez> ok
2014-03-20T14:59:22 * clown notes that it\'s almost time for gnome-a11y meeting.
2014-03-20T14:59:24 <jhernandez> it\'s ok
2014-03-20T14:59:36 <clown> I should have pushed that branch to github...
2014-03-20T14:59:44 <jhernandez> and re a11y-meeting, yeah
2014-03-20T14:59:54 <jhernandez> and re your last comment
2014-03-20T14:59:55 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-20T14:59:59 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6 and then did the pull request on it.
2014-03-20T15:00:10 * jhernandez nods
2014-03-20T15:00:24 <clown> maybe I will do that later (perhaps during the a11y-meeting).
