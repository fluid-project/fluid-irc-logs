b'2014-01-11T22:12:17 <Bosmon> I need to rush off to TTEA now but when I get back I will try to study why the login never concludes
2014-01-11T22:12:34 <Bosmon> Although I have an odd suspicion it may simply be because the required AT just isn\'t installed
2014-01-11T22:13:18 <Bosmon> ORCA in this case
2014-01-11T22:27:00 <colinclark> Thank you, Bosmon

2014-01-11T23:08:19 <cindyli> hi Justin_o_
2014-01-11T23:08:28 <Justin_o_> cindyli: hello
2014-01-11T23:08:36 <cindyli> r u continuing with PMT model transformation?
2014-01-11T23:09:25 <cindyli> Justin_o_: ^
2014-01-11T23:15:19 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i\'m doing some testing at the moment now that you fixed those checkboxes.. although so far it looks like the underlying preferences don\'t work
2014-01-11T23:16:19 <Justin_o_> cindyli: basically the transformations are all there.. I was hoping to implement the conditional transforms since the screen reader will turn on if any of the screen readers settings are on.. however there is a but with the model transformations.. not sure how to fix it.
2014-01-11T23:17:41 <cindyli> Justin_o_: do you mean the part that is to remove other screen reader preferences when the screen reader is disabled? would it be easier to add your own code to manually remove them?
2014-01-11T23:18:25 <cindyli> also, it what aspects "the underlying preferences don\'t work", Justin_o_? the selected preferences were not sent to server or they were sent but not correctly live update to OS?
2014-01-11T23:18:46 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i could do a hack like that, but it won\'t work for two-way transformations.. i think it\'s probably more important to get the connection between the pmt and pcp, as well as the web sockets working at this point though..
2014-01-11T23:19:30 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i believe the format is correct, with the exception of language and contrast... so it\'s probably that the system isn\'t applying most of them
2014-01-11T23:19:46 <cindyli> ok
2014-01-11T23:19:48 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i\'m going to reply to colin\'s e-mail about this now
2014-01-11T23:22:12 <cindyli> Justin_o_: i\'m thinking to take on the work to add the button in pmt that opens up pcp. but wonder how the workflow should be. clicking that button opens and goes to a new page with pcp demo? does that sound right?
2014-01-11T23:23:12 <cindyli> or follow the wireframe to close pmt and open pcp
2014-01-11T23:32:09 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i think just transitioning to a new page should be fine. kasparnet, colinclark, michelled any thoughts?
2014-01-11T23:32:19 <colinclark> oh wow
2014-01-11T23:32:31 <colinclark> the king and cindyli have emerged at the least expected moment!
2014-01-11T23:32:35 <colinclark> hello
2014-01-11T23:32:44 <Justin_o_> hello
2014-01-11T23:32:44 <colinclark> welcome to the party, where avtar gives us all great nicknames
2014-01-11T23:32:52 <Justin_o_> colinclark: sounds like fun
2014-01-11T23:33:00 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i\'m writing up a reply to your e-mail right now
2014-01-11T23:33:22 <colinclark> great, thanks
2014-01-11T23:33:56 <Justin_o_> colinclark: just sent it
2014-01-11T23:34:10 <colinclark> I think one key is to avoid doing things that Boyan could equally do
2014-01-11T23:34:13 <colinclark> if we even know what that is
2014-01-11T23:34:23 <colinclark> since he did say he would work tomorrow morning, his time
2014-01-11T23:34:33 <colinclark> so if there are things you want to leave for him or (hopefully) Chris, that\'s cool
2014-01-11T23:34:42 <colinclark> Kind of an awkward situation since we just need to get it working
2014-01-11T23:34:53 <colinclark> As for transitioning to a new page, that\'s totally fine
2014-01-11T23:37:25 <avtar> \'gentle justin\'
2014-01-11T23:38:02 <colinclark> so nice
2014-01-11T23:38:35 <Justin_o_> avtar: thanks :)
2014-01-11T23:38:42 <avtar> you\'ve earned it
2014-01-11T23:51:39 <cindyli> got it, Justin_o_ and colinclark
2014-01-11T23:53:26 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i\'m going to try to get the language into a correct format i think it should be codes like en and fr..
2014-01-11T23:53:48 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Justin_o_

2014-01-11T20:12:02 <Bosmon> Hey kasparnet
2014-01-11T20:12:12 <Bosmon> That merge you just did https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/195/files appears to have a reference to the bad cloud4all URL
2014-01-11T20:12:13 <colinclark> kasparnet: Double check your URLs in those two pull requests when you merge them into review2
2014-01-11T20:12:23 <colinclark> ah, sorry boz
2014-01-11T20:12:26 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-11T20:17:40 <kasparnet> colinclark, Bosmon: urgh - thanks for that
2014-01-11T20:17:57 <colinclark> np--sorry to bear bad news :)
2014-01-11T20:25:11 <Bosmon> kasparnet - my problem was really with the cloud4all URL itself : P
2014-01-11T20:25:50 <Bosmon> Although maybe the token gets passed to webanywhere rather than to cloud4all
2014-01-11T20:26:24 <Bosmon> In the following URL: http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/beta/?starting_url=http://cloud4all.info/&token=${{userToken}}
2014-01-11T20:33:39 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ah - so you\'d prefer the starting url to be last argument?!
2014-01-11T20:34:05 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well if it works it\'s fine : P
2014-01-11T20:34:18 <Bosmon> But as it stands it seems there could be some ambiguity in processing
2014-01-11T20:34:24 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah - very much so
2014-01-11T20:34:42 <kasparnet> but come to think of it, the token argument might be completely off
2014-01-11T20:35:21 <kasparnet> as I think it might have been used for the mammals UIO demo
2014-01-11T20:35:27 <Bosmon> yes
2014-01-11T20:35:38 <Bosmon> So that demo has been discontinued?
2014-01-11T20:35:46 <Bosmon> Or we\'re folding UIO stuff into dedicated PMT demos?
2014-01-11T20:36:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon: at least the reference it had was pointing to Avtars personal ec2
2014-01-11T20:36:12 <kasparnet> :)
2014-01-11T20:46:41 <colinclark> We\'re toasting any reference to the Mammals demo
2014-01-11T20:46:54 <colinclark> at some point, we need to start integrating instances of UIO itself with the Preferences Server
2014-01-11T20:47:01 <colinclark> and perhaps the Web Sockets Flow Manager interface
2014-01-11T20:47:06 <colinclark> so that it can just automatically do its thing
2014-01-11T20:47:32 <colinclark> and yes, the PMT and PCP, should they eventually be working, will be our demo of the Preferences Framework
2014-01-11T20:52:06 * michelled joined the channel
2014-01-11T20:52:33 <colinclark> michelled: Those two pull requests from kasparnet are still a bit confusing
2014-01-11T20:52:50 <colinclark> I think Bosmon knows where they\'re at
2014-01-11T20:53:07 <colinclark> but I\'d love for them to go into the repo if we can tweak them for kasparnet, who is probably busy Making Shit Work
2014-01-11T20:53:19 <michelled> yes :)
2014-01-11T20:53:31 <michelled> Bosmon7: are you there?
2014-01-11T20:54:46 <Bosmon> I\'m sort of here
2014-01-11T20:55:13 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-11T20:55:17 <colinclark> that\'s about how I feel
2014-01-11T20:56:26 <michelled> Bosmon: is there something I can do with those pull requests? I haven\'t actually looked yet, which I should, but I was prioritizing tea
2014-01-11T20:56:32 <colinclark> have tea
2014-01-11T20:56:34 <colinclark> that\'s what I\'m doing
2014-01-11T20:56:49 <colinclark> michelled: I\'m guessing, by the way, that this is the latest branch that Justin was working on: https://github.com/jobara/prefsEditors/tree/GPII-226
2014-01-11T20:57:00 <colinclark> I don\'t know if cindy has something else, but it sounds like it wasn\'t working anyway
2014-01-11T20:57:08 <Bosmon> I will have tea too : P
2014-01-11T20:57:18 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-11T20:57:25 <Bosmon> But I\'m a little puzzled by the way that kasparnet is raising pull requests and apparently merging them himself : P
2014-01-11T20:57:37 <colinclark> he\'s not
2014-01-11T20:57:46 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-11T20:57:46 <colinclark> Or rather, he\'s doing so on the hack branch
2014-01-11T20:57:49 <colinclark> review2, it\'s called
2014-01-11T20:57:50 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2014-01-11T20:57:51 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-11T20:58:04 <colinclark> and I\'m quite happy for him to move as fast as he wants in this regard
2014-01-11T20:58:08 <michelled> he did accidentally merge one this morning into master, but it had already passed code review from colinclark
2014-01-11T20:58:10 <colinclark> I\'m just keeping an eye on tidy up
2014-01-11T20:58:15 <colinclark> phew :)
2014-01-11T21:09:13 <michelled> Bosmon: let me know if you want me to look at or test any pull requests
2014-01-11T21:18:56 <Bosmon> michelled - perhaps https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/194/files ?
2014-01-11T21:19:01 <Bosmon> Seems like it might be ready now
2014-01-11T21:19:23 <michelled> ok
2014-01-11T21:35:03 <colinclark> michelled: I\'m feeling quite dumb about Git right now
2014-01-11T21:35:07 <colinclark> do you have a super quick sec?
2014-01-11T21:35:29 <michelled> yep
2014-01-11T21:40:36 <colinclark> So, I forked Andy\'s STMM repo: https://github.com/AndreasStiegler/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker1
2014-01-11T21:42:23 <colinclark> here\'s my fork: https://github.com/colinbdclark/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker1
2014-01-11T21:42:26 <colinclark> and then I cloned my fork
2014-01-11T21:42:30 <colinclark> made some changes, pushed them up
2014-01-11T21:42:49 <colinclark> but Github never gave me the little "you made change, would you like to make a pull request?" UI when I did that
2014-01-11T21:42:56 <colinclark> is there something about the repositories?
2014-01-11T21:43:34 <Bosmon> colinclark - I had something similar the other day
2014-01-11T21:43:41 <Bosmon> And the reason was a little embarrassing
2014-01-11T21:43:47 <Bosmon> It was that I was not actually logged on to github : P
2014-01-11T21:44:20 <colinclark> Interestingly, it looks like I am
2014-01-11T21:44:27 <Bosmon> I seem to have no problems making a pull request even from your branch
2014-01-11T21:44:34 <Bosmon> https://github.com/colinbdclark/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker1/compare/GPII-275?expand=1
2014-01-11T21:44:35 <colinclark> I\'m so worried I\'ve done something dumb
2014-01-11T21:44:39 <colinclark> but let me log in and out
2014-01-11T21:44:50 <michelled> I see the pull request option on your branch
2014-01-11T21:44:55 <michelled> I think they\'ve changed the UI
2014-01-11T21:45:00 <colinclark> michelled, kasparnet: just as a heads up, Manuel as SMSed Boyan and contacted Chris via Eleni
2014-01-11T21:45:03 <colinclark> so we might hear from them
2014-01-11T21:45:10 <colinclark> I think we should try to coordinate the whole team to do some work tomorrow
2014-01-11T21:46:10 <colinclark> My impression, at this point, is that Cindy\'s email provides all the details
2014-01-11T21:46:21 <colinclark> and that basically Chris and Boyan need to just continue the effort to "make it work"
2014-01-11T21:46:30 <colinclark> is that correct, michelled / kasparnet?
2014-01-11T21:47:13 <michelled> yes, that seems right to me
2014-01-11T21:47:57 <colinclark> michelled: you\'re right re: github
2014-01-11T21:48:00 <colinclark> it\'s just a little grey button now
2014-01-11T21:48:13 <colinclark> it used to be a nice, easy-to-read yellow bar that came up when it detected new changes pushed
2014-01-11T21:48:17 <colinclark> I suck :(
2014-01-11T21:49:01 <kasparnet> colinclark, michelled: I get both - and still haven\'t figured out when I get what.. I think there is like a 5 minute limit on the nice yellow bar that comes up disregarding what branch you\'re on
2014-01-11T21:49:01 <michelled> I guess that\'s the problem with constantly changing UIs. Users *learn*
2014-01-11T21:49:59 <colinclark> cool, thanks for helping me guys
2014-01-11T21:50:11 <Bosmon> +1 for kasparnet\'s observation : P
2014-01-11T21:50:19 <Bosmon> I think the "grey button" UI has been in place for quite a while
2014-01-11T21:50:27 <Bosmon> But the "bright bar UI" seems time-dependent
2014-01-11T21:50:31 <colinclark> kasparnet: If necessary, do you feel like you know enough, from Cindy\'s email, to point Boyan and/or Chris to where they need to continue their work?
2014-01-11T21:51:43 <Bosmon> colinclark - perhaps you can help me with a dumb problem of my own :)
2014-01-11T21:51:56 <Bosmon> When my Fedora instance puts up this "big clock screensaver" I have no bloody idea how to wake it up
2014-01-11T21:51:58 <colinclark> yup, fire away
2014-01-11T21:52:01 <colinclark> oh :)
2014-01-11T21:52:06 <colinclark> Drag from the bottom of the screen
2014-01-11T21:52:07 <Bosmon> I try all kinds of things and it just stays there
2014-01-11T21:52:11 <Bosmon> DRAG FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN!
2014-01-11T21:52:12 <colinclark> probably the dorkiest thing they\'ve ever done
2014-01-11T21:52:14 <colinclark> it\'s like a phone
2014-01-11T21:52:21 <Bosmon> They are total dorks through and through
2014-01-11T21:52:29 <kasparnet> hahaha
2014-01-11T21:52:34 <Bosmon> All of their UI controls are of such a light shade of grey that any normal user assumes they are disabled
2014-01-11T21:53:11 <Bosmon> And their "filing cabinet for files" icon reeks of 1980s IBM
2014-01-11T21:55:05 <colinclark> it\'s cute
2014-01-11T21:55:40 <Bosmon> The UI performance inside my VirtualBox is about as good as I get when using NX to connect to machines in Ireland : P
2014-01-11T22:02:21 <colinclark> You may need to turn on 3D acceleration
2014-01-11T22:02:46 <colinclark> I get pretty decent performance in VMWare and dismal performance in VBox
2014-01-11T22:02:49 <colinclark> and lots of artifacts, too
2014-01-11T22:03:52 <kasparnet> Bosmon, colinclark: my fedora in VBox is absolutely horrific as well, 3D or not (or perhaps the problem was that it exploded when 3d was on, forcing me to turn it off)
2014-01-11T22:04:00 <colinclark> ah
2014-01-11T22:04:04 <kasparnet> anyway, I feel sorry for myself whenever I use it
2014-01-11T22:04:12 <colinclark> I think that when the VBox Guest Additions are installed, it\'s usually more reliable
2014-01-11T22:04:19 <colinclark> but they always lag behind Fedora releases by a lot
2014-01-11T22:05:07 <colinclark> Though I would have thought your new Air had a better GPU in it
2014-01-11T22:05:14 <michelled> kasparnet: did you mean to push GPII-383 branch to the project repo?
2014-01-11T22:06:45 * FerranGaallego joined the channel
2014-01-11T22:07:31 <Bosmon> Yes, I think some artefacts went away when I turned on 3d acceleration
2014-01-11T22:07:39 <Bosmon> But the performance is still appalling
2014-01-11T22:10:31 <Bosmon> ok, this is where I\'ve got so far investigating the Linux acceptance test hangs
2014-01-11T22:11:06 <Bosmon> The hang is definitely caused by test 5, "        name: "Testing screenreader_common using Flat matchmaker","
2014-01-11T22:11:12 <Bosmon> And the hang occurs at sequence point 3
2014-01-11T22:11:32 <Bosmon> It has just issued {login}.send
2014-01-11T22:11:40 <Bosmon> And it is waiting for {login}.events.onComplete
2014-01-11T22:11:44 <Bosmon> Which for some reason never arrives
2014-01-11T22:12:03 <Bosmon> I guess I should put in some nicer diagnostics for the IoC testing framework so that information of this kind can appear automatically
