2014-04-02T16:28:42 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I believe you need to use "outputValue" with this transformer
2014-04-02T16:29:41 <cindyli> Bosmon7: like this:
2014-04-02T16:29:41 <cindyli> var transform = {
2014-04-02T16:29:41 <cindyli> type: "fluid.transforms.valueMapper",
2014-04-02T16:29:41 <cindyli> inputPath: "hazard",
2014-04-02T16:29:41 <cindyli> options: {
2014-04-02T16:29:41 <cindyli> "flashing": {

2014-04-02T16:29:44 <cindyli> };

2014-04-02T16:33:45 <colinclark> cindyli: we\xe2\x80\x99re just scheduling a meeting to talk specifically about model transformation next week
2014-04-02T16:33:52 <colinclark> we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking Wednesday at 1 pm EDT
2014-04-02T16:33:54 <colinclark> does that time work for you?
2014-04-02T16:34:00 <colinclark> it would be awesome to have you there
2014-04-02T16:34:05 <colinclark> since you are, as I mentioned, awesome
2014-04-02T16:34:21 <cindyli> :-$
2014-04-02T16:34:33 <cindyli> the meeting time is fine with me, colinclark
2014-04-02T16:34:57 <colinclark> cool!
2014-04-02T16:34:59 <colinclark> or rather
2014-04-02T16:35:00 <colinclark> awesome!
2014-04-02T16:35:19 <clown> cindyli:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y
2014-04-02T16:35:28 <cindyli> wait, colinclark, which Wednesday? today?
2014-04-02T16:35:33 <colinclark> next
2014-04-02T16:35:50 <cindyli> cool. fine with me
2014-04-02T16:40:38 <cindyli> Bosmon7: the issue was sourced from here - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformation.js#L113
2014-04-02T16:41:11 <cindyli> only primitive values are returned, objects will be expanded.
2014-04-02T16:41:29 <Bosmon7> cindyli - ok, that seems to be the same behaviour as every other transformer then
2014-04-02T16:41:37 <cindyli> let me see if i can write a transform to output the compound values for this func to expand
2014-04-02T16:41:38 <Bosmon7> I think you remember it from the condition expander
2014-04-02T16:41:50 <Bosmon7> So you should just write the "literalValue" key to protect your compound object
2014-04-02T16:42:16 <cindyli> ya. trying
2014-04-02T16:54:15 <cindyli> this one works, Bosmon7
2014-04-02T16:54:15 <cindyli> var model = {
2014-04-02T16:54:15 <cindyli> hazard: "flashing"

2014-04-02T16:54:39 <cindyli> thanks for the help, Bosmon7
2014-04-02T16:54:46 <Bosmon7> cindyli - cool
2014-04-02T16:54:58 <Bosmon7> So you needed both outputValue AND literalValue, nested together?
2014-04-02T16:55:24 <cindyli> seems like. let me try removing outputValue
2014-04-02T16:56:02 <cindyli> outputValue needs to be there, Bosmon7
2014-04-02T16:56:11 <Bosmon7> cindyli - ok
2014-04-02T16:56:29 <Bosmon7> COuld you please write up a JIRA documenting your experiences and your use case, and raise it against the Model Transformation component?
2014-04-02T16:56:55 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon7, heading out for soccer, will do it once i\'m back
2014-04-02T16:58:41 <Bosmon7> cheers - have fun!

2014-04-02T13:25:03 <jhernandez> don\'t worry about missing yesterday\'s ping
2014-04-02T13:25:36 <jhernandez> well, maybe GPII-413 is hard to follow
2014-04-02T13:25:54 <jhernandez> but, as a brief resume
2014-04-02T13:26:39 <jhernandez> I sketched how we can provide living installedSolutions
2014-04-02T13:28:08 <jhernandez> in order to finish my experiment, the only missing thing is to tell the gpii to use the installedSolutions I\'m providing
2014-04-02T13:31:21 <jhernandez> but I\'m not sure how to achieve this - should I just write my own installedSolutions file and tell the gpii about it through the config files?

2014-04-02T14:09:32 <simonjb> hi Bosmon7, we found an issue yesterday with "use strict" in Fluid.js and Safari 7 on Mac: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5298
2014-04-02T14:10:19 <Bosmon7> jhernandez - presumably when it is "living" it is not a "file" any more?
2014-04-02T14:10:30 <Bosmon7> In general all of these decisions are controlled by the various "configs", yes
2014-04-02T14:12:14 <Bosmon7> Thanks for the report, simonjb
2014-04-02T14:12:22 <colinclark> Hey cindyli, that meeting I emailed you about yesterday\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-04-02T14:12:32 <colinclark> has turned out to be an hour early because of the time change in Europe
2014-04-02T14:12:41 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m just finishing up a meeting, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll be late
2014-04-02T14:12:51 <colinclark> are you available in about 10 minutes to join me in the meeting?
2014-04-02T14:13:22 <Bosmon7> simonjb - you may have to delve into this one yourself since I don\'t have access to a Mac
2014-04-02T14:14:06 <cindyli> sure, colinclark
2014-04-02T14:14:06 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-04-02T14:14:12 <colinclark> thanks, cindyli
2014-04-02T14:14:14 <cindyli> np
2014-04-02T14:15:11 <jhernandez> Bosmon7: yeah, that\'s the point, how should I say the system to use my \'living\' installedSolutions?
2014-04-02T14:16:03 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ok
2014-04-02T14:19:24 <Bosmon7> jhernandez - this implementation is controlled by the files development.json / production.json in deviceReporter\'s configs
2014-04-02T14:20:06 * jhernandez nods
2014-04-02T14:20:52 <jhernandez> the plan is to remove this from that file(s)
2014-04-02T14:21:44 <Bosmon7> The thing we have now should be renamed as "staticDeviceReporter" or so
2014-04-02T14:24:46 <colinclark> cindyli: Here\xe2\x80\x99s the meeting URL; it\xe2\x80\x99s a Google Hangout https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/72cpi5meaun1a8eckde9j6sjds?hl=de
2014-04-02T14:26:42 <colinclark> cindyli: this is the English link, in case it helps :) https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/72cpi5meaun1a8eckde9j6sjds
2014-04-02T14:28:10 <jhernandez> Bosmon7: ok
2014-04-02T14:29:45 <jhernandez> so, could you please comment/elaborate/whatever about it on GPII-413?
2014-04-02T14:31:27 <Bosmon7> jhernandez - ok, I can give some suggestions
2014-04-02T14:31:38 <cindyli> colinclark: sorry i\'m late. joined the english version..
2014-04-02T14:32:03 <Bosmon7> Can you think of anything else that should influence which "device reporter plugins" start up, other than i) platform, ii) overall GPII configuration (that is, production/development) - jhernandez

2014-04-02T14:41:02 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-04-02T14:41:09 <Bosmon7> Let\'s talk about this at the upcoming arch meeting
2014-04-02T14:41:12 <Bosmon7> Will you be coming along?
2014-04-02T14:41:15 <Bosmon7> I guess in about 80 minutes
2014-04-02T14:41:24 <jhernandez> sure
2014-04-02T14:44:16 <Bosmon7> cool
2014-04-02T14:58:05 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon7, a question about "fluid.transforms.valueMapper". I have a use case that one value needs to be mapped to multiple output paths and values. is that doable with valueMapper? tried with using array on mapper options but no success yet

2014-04-02T15:02:18 <jhernandez> mais un petit peu seulement
2014-04-02T15:03:50 <jhernandez> btw, the other day I met a canadian girl from Quebec
2014-04-02T15:04:08 <clown> chances are \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know her.
2014-04-02T15:04:11 <clown> ;-)
2014-04-02T15:04:16 <jhernandez> both their french and english accents were strange
2014-04-02T15:04:17 <jhernandez> xD
2014-04-02T15:05:07 <clown> parce que elle parles Qu\xc3\xa9becois, pas Parisien.
2014-04-02T15:05:26 <clown> or something....
2014-04-02T15:05:44 <jhernandez> bien sur!
2014-04-02T15:09:55 * jash4 has quit
2014-04-02T15:15:03 <Bosmon7> cindyli - remember our issues with compound values in transforms
2014-04-02T15:15:40 <Bosmon7> Well, this doesn\'t look the same
2014-04-02T15:16:07 <Bosmon7> Your use of the valueMapper doesn\'t look correct
2014-04-02T15:16:23 <cindyli> Bosmon7: the array part?
2014-04-02T15:17:10 <Bosmon7> Oh, I see
2014-04-02T15:18:11 <Bosmon7> Feel free to issue a pull request implementing this functionality :)
2014-04-02T15:18:32 <cindyli> haha. good point. will try, Bosmon7
2014-04-02T15:19:17 <Bosmon7> Although to be sure I\'m not convinced that the implementation of the valueMapper is really very helpfully consistent with that of our other transforms
2014-04-02T15:19:42 <Bosmon7> All of the other compound transforms reset the parser into its "root condition" when branches get evaluated
2014-04-02T15:19:55 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - we should add this to our list of things to talk about at arch
2014-04-02T15:20:08 <Bosmon7> For example, the condition and array expanders behave one way
2014-04-02T15:20:24 <Bosmon7> And the valueMapper has this odd custom behaviour with special names for input and output paths and values
2014-04-02T15:20:38 <Bosmon7> It also has the capability to explicitly output "undefined" values which we have decided is impossible
2014-04-02T15:20:45 <Bosmon7> In the new idiom, an output of undefined is equivalent to no output
2014-04-02T15:20:57 <Bosmon7> So I think we really need to overhaul the valueMapper in the light of our newer standards
2014-04-02T15:21:23 <Bosmon7> If it operated according to the standard, for example, cindyli wouldn\'t have to implement any custom behaviour to get what she wants
2014-04-02T15:21:27 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: yeah
2014-04-02T15:21:45 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: I\'ll add it to the agenda
2014-04-02T15:21:46 <Bosmon7> Since she could just start writing "a document" in one of the branches with whatever outputPath she likes
2014-04-02T15:21:54 <Bosmon7> Including multiple ones
2014-04-02T15:22:40 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - remind me, we still have no way to reset the outputPath in a set of compound transforms, right?
2014-04-02T15:22:48 <Bosmon7> It just accretes by getting longer, never shorter?
2014-04-02T15:23:04 <kasparnet> yeah, I believe so
2014-04-02T15:23:07 <kasparnet> Bosmon7:
2014-04-02T15:23:20 <Bosmon7> ok, cool
2014-04-02T15:23:28 <Bosmon7> So we could probably simplify the valueMapper quite a lot
2014-04-02T15:23:41 <Bosmon7> Do you know of any notable examples of it in the preferences sets that we need to preserve?
2014-04-02T15:28:21 <cindyli> Bosmon7: in terms of the functionality i need with valueMapper, should I implement the part I need in the metadata demo and discard it once valueMapper is re-structured in the framework?
2014-04-02T15:33:25 <Bosmon7> cindyli - it\'s ok to write your own transformer, yes - you could even try to write a prototype "simplified valueMapper"
2014-04-02T15:40:24 <cindyli> ok
2014-04-02T15:54:17 * jhung joined the channel
2014-04-02T16:05:34 <kasparnet> Bosmon7, colinclark: will you be joining the arch meeting
2014-04-02T16:05:52 <Bosmon7> yup
2014-04-02T16:05:55 <Bosmon7> Just finishing up
2014-04-02T16:07:49 * michelled joined the channel
2014-04-02T16:23:27 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I\'m just wondering whether your use case could be dealt with more simply than you have done
2014-04-02T16:24:23 <cindyli> Bosmon7: do you want me to describe my use case?
2014-04-02T16:24:33 <Bosmon7> cindyli - so in terms of your pastie http://pastie.org/8988878
2014-04-02T16:25:00 <Bosmon7> I\'m wondering why this isn\'t just a case of outputing the compound value { hasHazard: true, sound: true} ?
2014-04-02T16:25:22 <cindyli> ha, let me try
2014-04-02T16:27:40 <cindyli> Bosmon7: still output an empty object. here\'s the new transform object:
2014-04-02T16:27:42 <cindyli> var transform = {
2014-04-02T16:27:42 <cindyli> type: "fluid.transforms.valueMapper",
2014-04-02T16:27:42 <cindyli> inputPath: "hazard",
2014-04-02T16:27:42 <cindyli> options: {
2014-04-02T16:27:42 <cindyli> "flashing": {
'
