2014-08-26T19:04:59 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2014-08-26T19:05:19 <anastasiac> jhung, did you see these links to the PHET source code? http://phet.colorado.edu/en/about/source-code
2014-08-26T19:06:41 * SonicX joined the channel
2014-08-26T19:07:34 <jhung> I\'m checking now anastasiac - I wonder if it has the javascript?
2014-08-26T19:08:02 <anastasiac> jhung, the phet source is available from SVN
2014-08-26T19:13:28 <anastasiac> jhung, I found this: https://phet.unfuddle.com/a#/repositories/23262/browse?path=%2Ftrunk%2Fsimulations-html%2Fsimulations&commit=70870
2014-08-26T19:13:43 <jhung> anastasiac: actually the HTML production simulations are here https://github.com/phetsims
2014-08-26T19:13:46 <jhung> or here: https://github.com/phetsims?tab=repositories
2014-08-26T19:13:58 <anastasiac> well, even better!
2014-08-26T19:14:02 <jhung> yeah. :)

2014-08-26T19:14:25 * jhung rejoices
2014-08-26T19:14:32 <anastasiac> michelled: ^
2014-08-26T19:16:28 <jhung> I\'m guessing we would have to do a little investigation to find out how much effort it would be to make the simulation (or parts of it anyway) accessible. Then figure out if we\'re better off building something simple anastasiac.
2014-08-26T19:18:57 <anastasiac> exactly, jhung. If we can work with an existing simulation, that would be much better
2014-08-26T19:19:50 <jhung> I\'m going to clone it now and poke around anastasiac.
2014-08-26T19:20:08 <anastasiac> great

2014-08-26T20:02:03 <Bosmon> hi cindyli
2014-08-26T20:02:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: just to confirm again this is not allowed in the IoC testing framework:
2014-08-26T20:02:57 <cindyli> jQueryTrigger: "click",
2014-08-26T20:02:57 <cindyli> element: "{feedbackLoader feedback}.dom.matchConfirmationButton"
2014-08-26T20:03:03 <cindyli> {feedbackLoader feedback}
2014-08-26T20:03:05 <Bosmon> That is not allowed
2014-08-26T20:03:08 <cindyli> ok
2014-08-26T20:03:19 <Bosmon> IoCSS selectors are currently only allowed in distributeOptions blocks
2014-08-26T20:03:31 <cindyli> fine, i will find a more manual way
2014-08-26T20:03:56 <Bosmon> Well, you can do it by writing this configuration in a distributeOptions block
2014-08-26T20:04:49 <cindyli> right. that\'s an idea. but i have more things than that such as "{feedbackLoader bindMatchConfirmation}.events.onDialogReady"
2014-08-26T20:04:56 <cindyli> we are back to the same spot :)
2014-08-26T20:05:41 <cindyli> the work around i\'m using is to manually attach listeners for subcomponents
2014-08-26T20:05:49 <cindyli> feedbackLoader.feedback.events.onDialogReady.addListener(function () {...
2014-08-26T20:06:03 <cindyli> so far works well
2014-08-26T20:06:53 * slim joined the channel
2014-08-26T20:07:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - that is an extremely bad and fragile style : P
2014-08-26T20:07:22 <Bosmon> I recommmend you use the distributeOptions approach
2014-08-26T20:07:35 * slim has quit
2014-08-26T20:08:04 <Bosmon> Another possibility is to inject the events upwards that you want to attach listeners to
2014-08-26T20:08:27 <cindyli> ok
2014-08-26T20:08:40 <Bosmon> But in general you should avoid binding to the exact path of the subcomponent
2014-08-26T20:08:53 <Bosmon> As well as using some kind of declarative approach rather than "addListener"
2014-08-26T20:09:36 <cindyli> oh. addListener is so handy :P

2014-08-26T13:25:46 <anastasiac> ok, jhung
2014-08-26T13:26:47 <jhung> fyi, we haven\'t heard back from phet yet. I am wondering if we should set a deadline before we consider building our own (simple) simulation anastasiac.
2014-08-26T13:27:21 <anastasiac> who did you contact, jhung?
2014-08-26T13:28:14 <jhung> anastasiac: digging it up now.
2014-08-26T13:29:22 <jhung> forwarded anastasiac.

2014-08-26T13:35:33 * yzen joined the channel
2014-08-26T13:38:02 <jhung> Justin_o: according to the CSS, the background on the icons match the colour of the background of the contrast theme. Perhaps it should be inverted?
2014-08-26T13:38:09 <jhung> I think it would look better.
2014-08-26T13:39:21 <Justin_o> jhung: it would be more consistent

2014-08-26T14:07:46 <Bosmon> How are you getting on tody?
2014-08-26T14:09:05 <cindyli> pretty good, Bosmon. done with the model relay and the template loader. working on the last piece to make sure one model change for one button click

2014-08-26T15:04:49 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon
2014-08-26T15:05:11 <Bosmon> hi cindyli
2014-08-26T15:06:15 <cindyli> regarding the globalDismissal, when clicking anywhere else not defined in the dismissal exceptions should close the dialog
2014-08-26T15:06:52 <cindyli> in the feedback tool, when match dialog is open, clicking on the mismatch button would not close the opened match dialog
2014-08-26T15:07:05 <cindyli> so there\'s situation we have both dialogs open
2014-08-26T15:08:07 <cindyli> maybe i should also trace down if the globalDismissal has been released when the 2nd button is clicked. one sec
2014-08-26T15:10:09 <cindyli> no, the globalDismissal is not yet released.
2014-08-26T15:11:23 <jhung> anastasiac: it seems that NVDA is intentionally ignoring aria-label and aria-labelledby on certain block-level elements.
2014-08-26T15:11:37 <anastasiac> oh, well isn\xe2\x80\x99t that nice of it, jhung?
2014-08-26T15:12:13 <jhung> anastasiac: yeah you can say that.
2014-08-26T15:12:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: three blocks above ^
2014-08-26T15:13:18 <jhung> anastasiac: A work-around is to put role="textbox" and aria-readonly="true", but it\'s a hack and not semantically correct.
2014-08-26T15:13:52 <anastasiac> jhung, which types of elements is it ignoring?
2014-08-26T15:14:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I think you will need to explicitly dismiss any open dialogs whenever any of the buttons are pressed
2014-08-26T15:14:39 <jhung> <span  tabindex="0" role="math" aria-label="NVDA will ignore this label" aria-readonly="true" aria-describedby="c02-equation-1">
2014-08-26T15:14:40 <jhung> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">\xe2\x80\xa6</math></span>
2014-08-26T15:14:40 <Bosmon> Or else you could experiment with leaving out the buttons from the dismissal exceptions entirely
2014-08-26T15:15:20 <Bosmon> I remember that sometimes there might have been an issue with the dialog self-cancelling if the button was not included, but it doesn\'t seem like a reasonable result
2014-08-26T15:15:27 * kasparne_ has quit
2014-08-26T15:15:28 <jhung> ignore the tabindex and aria-readonly properties. I was just experimenting anastasiac.
2014-08-26T15:16:10 <anastasiac> jhung, I wonder if we can work around it by moving the attributes onto elements where they won\xe2\x80\x99t be ignored?
2014-08-26T15:16:25 <jhung> anastasiac: good idea. I will try that.
2014-08-26T15:21:10 <cindyli> Bosmon: one click on the button only adds that button into the dismissal exceptions. would that affect the other button?
2014-08-26T15:21:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - I assume the issue is that the click on the 2nd button excludes itself too
2014-08-26T15:21:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - have you tried eliminating all buttons from the exceptions?
2014-08-26T15:23:47 <cindyli> yes tried, and found a bit more logic needs to be changed to do that since the dialog is immediately opened once the dialog content is rendered and ready.
2014-08-26T15:24:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - what do you mean?
2014-08-26T15:26:27 <cindyli> right now, if i remove the button from the exception list just by commenting out that one line, the dialog would not open at all when the button is clicked \'cuz the first button click triggers the whole process of dialog creating and content rendering.
2014-08-26T15:26:55 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, so you still find that the global dismissal reacts with itself?
2014-08-26T15:27:06 <cindyli> if the button is not in the list, the dialog will be closed immediately
2014-08-26T15:27:07 <Bosmon> Somehow it manages to respond to the original click event which opens the dialog?
2014-08-26T15:27:13 <cindyli> yes
2014-08-26T15:27:16 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-26T15:27:30 <Bosmon> That\'s awkward
2014-08-26T15:28:43 <cindyli> Bosmon: back to your statement - "I assume the issue is that the click on the 2nd button excludes itself too"
2014-08-26T15:28:49 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-08-26T15:28:58 <Bosmon> Well it seems that the issue is that all such clicks exclude themselves
2014-08-26T15:29:11 <cindyli> you think adding the button into the exception list happens before the dialog creation process?
2014-08-26T15:29:16 <Bosmon> And looking at the architecture of globalDismissal, I guess there is some reason why
2014-08-26T15:29:23 <Bosmon> Since globalDismissal relies on a global document click handler
2014-08-26T15:29:46 <Bosmon> Given the "bubble up" architecture of these events, I guess it is the case that the global dismissal handler will always be notified strictly after any click handler which is used to arm it
2014-08-26T15:30:31 <Bosmon> My suggestion to start with is to hack it, and wrap the handler to the original click event in a setTimeout(1), as well as eliminating the buttons from the dismissal exceptions
2014-08-26T15:30:41 <Bosmon> And see if the dialogs now stop self-dismissing
2014-08-26T15:32:48 <cindyli> stand up time. will be back soon

2014-08-26T16:16:55 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed my first pass at the EPUB restructuring: https://github.com/acheetham/EPUB/tree/FLOE-228  When you have a minute, could you give it a quick look, let me know if it seems reasonable to you?

2014-08-26T16:26:54 <jhung> anastasiac: the structure looks good. It\'s nice that it now matches what an EPUB would look like. The Readme should remove "and audio" from the Notes section. Also the bullet regarding Pandoc under "Helpful Resources" can be removed.
2014-08-26T16:27:22 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung. I deliberately mirrored the EPUB structure to make zipping it up easier :-)
