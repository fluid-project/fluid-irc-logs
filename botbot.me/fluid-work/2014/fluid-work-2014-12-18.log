2014-12-18T16:16:05 <Justin_o> how would you categorize those?
2014-12-18T16:16:19 <Justin_o> i don't think all of them were assigned categories yet

2014-12-18T19:08:10 <colinclark> hiya
2014-12-18T19:08:56 <avtar> i was wondering if you all use 32 or 64bit windows VMs when testing gpii features

2014-12-18T19:58:23 <avtar> kasparnet: any word regarding that preferences server fix? amatas is going to spend some time on creating a docker image for it

2014-12-18T20:31:03 <kasparnet> avtar: just catching up on thread
2014-12-18T20:31:57 <kasparnet> avtar: so we
2014-12-18T20:32:06 <kasparnet> 're saying that people should install 32bit node on windows
2014-12-18T20:32:11 <kasparnet> due to that annoying issue
2014-12-18T20:32:22 <kasparnet> so that should be fine for testing/servers as well
2014-12-18T20:33:20 <kasparnet> avtar: regarding prefs server fix, are we talking about the CORS put issue with kettle or something else?
2014-12-18T20:39:31 <avtar> kasparnet: the production related fix for the preferences server
2014-12-18T20:39:54 <kasparnet> ah yes, that should be ready afaik - sorry for not pinging you on that
2014-12-18T20:39:59 <kasparnet> let me just find some links
2014-12-18T20:40:37 <avtar> i can't believe you didn't ping me :'(
2014-12-18T20:40:48 * Sepideh joined the channel
2014-12-18T20:41:03 <kasparnet> I know.. shame on me
2014-12-18T20:41:45 <kasparnet> avtar - it should be in master: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/291
2014-12-18T20:42:12 <kasparnet> avtar: even did instructions on setting things up for testing, based on our chat; https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ProductionSetupInstructions.md
2014-12-18T20:42:57 <kasparnet> avtar: this section (and next) being the most relevant ones: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ProductionSetupInstructions.md#running-the-preferences-server-in-standalone-production-mode
2014-12-18T20:43:26 <kasparnet> avtar: I did a fix for kettle though, that isn't yet in universals dependency
2014-12-18T20:43:41 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-12-18T20:43:47 <avtar> kasparnet: that's a good looking readme, i'll tell you what
2014-12-18T20:44:03 <kasparnet> avtar: but if you give me till tomorrow morning CET, I'll test and merge in
2014-12-18T20:44:28 <kasparnet> since we'd probably need to redeploy the prefs server after it has been merged
2014-12-18T20:45:33 <avtar> kasparnet: what time do you leave tomorrow?
2014-12-18T20:45:45 <kasparnet> avtar: 10pm my flight leaves
2014-12-18T20:47:01 <avtar> ok
2014-12-18T20:47:48 <avtar> i'll check in with you tomorrow morning before making any changes
2014-12-18T20:48:23 <avtar> that should give amatas and me everything we need for looking into containers
