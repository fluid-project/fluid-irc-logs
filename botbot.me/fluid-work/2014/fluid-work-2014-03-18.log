2014-03-18T19:50:06 <jhernandez> yeah, I had a few attempts, but it ended up in nothing, but because I wanted to make a big step at once, and we need shorter but consistent steps
2014-03-18T19:50:25 <jhernandez> clown: not already, give me 5 mins
2014-03-18T19:50:53 <jhernandez> do you need that utf8 thing? xDD
2014-03-18T19:50:59 <clown> no worries.  I'll give you 10 mins.
2014-03-18T19:51:11 <clown> nah.  I just thought I would start from a clean slate.
2014-03-18T19:51:14 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-03-18T19:51:17 <clown> I don't *need* it.
2014-03-18T20:02:27 <jhernandez> done
2014-03-18T20:02:50 <jhernandez> now I have to cook for Sara
2014-03-18T20:02:51 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-18T20:02:58 <clown> lucky Sara.
2014-03-18T20:03:01 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-18T20:03:07 <clown> Okay, I'll pull it in.
2014-03-18T20:03:14 <jhernandez> after having diner will finish with the re-release of accerciser
2014-03-18T20:03:19 <jhernandez> :)

b'2014-03-18T18:57:46 <jhernandez> basically, a method to get all the packages at once, either using filters or not
2014-03-18T18:57:49 <clown> jhernandez:  fatal: corrupt patch at line 45
2014-03-18T18:58:00 <jhernandez> mm
2014-03-18T18:58:06 * clown diganosing.
2014-03-18T18:58:35 <clown> line 45 is the last line, fwiwi
2014-03-18T18:58:39 <clown> *fwiw
2014-03-18T18:59:19 <jhernandez> open the patch and check that it doesn\'t have "strange things"
2014-03-18T18:59:39 <jhernandez> with "strange things" I mean http headers
2014-03-18T18:59:41 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-18T19:00:19 <clown> nope.  I copied from the "raw paste data" at the bottom of the page.
2014-03-18T19:00:31 <clown> maybe it needs a new line at the end?  I\'ll try that.
2014-03-18T19:00:54 <clown> yup, that was it.
2014-03-18T19:00:55 <jhernandez> it applies well here
2014-03-18T19:00:59 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-03-18T19:02:00 <clown> it built.
2014-03-18T19:02:07 <clown> just run the unit tests?
2014-03-18T19:02:09 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:02:18 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-18T19:03:13 <clown> running (this takes a bit of time...)
2014-03-18T19:03:54 * jhernandez nods
2014-03-18T19:05:22 <clown> getting there...
2014-03-18T19:05:28 <jhernandez> meanwhile, I\'ll be re-releasing accerciser 3.11.92 ...
2014-03-18T19:07:15 <clown> whatever for?
2014-03-18T19:07:37 <jhernandez> btw, we\'re in code freeze, so your latest update on bgo 726265 won\'t get before 3.12 :(
2014-03-18T19:07:55 <clown> that\'s fine.  I\'ll just apply locally.  :-)
2014-03-18T19:08:46 <clown> jhernandez:  "All tests concluded: 14/14 total passed in 250554ms - PASS"
2014-03-18T19:08:50 <clown> \\o/
2014-03-18T19:09:05 <jhernandez> I have to re-release in order to amend the patch from bgo 726332 (got a freeze break exception from the RT) :)
2014-03-18T19:09:37 * clown wishes #fluid-work knew about gnome bugzillas.
2014-03-18T19:09:44 <jhernandez> clown: great, will commit it in a few minutes then
2014-03-18T19:09:49 <jhernandez> haha
2014-03-18T19:10:09 <jhernandez> that\'s true, sorry:
2014-03-18T19:10:17 <jhernandez> https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726332
2014-03-18T19:11:21 <clown> btw, jhernandez, if I quit accerciser via the File menu "Quit" item, when I restart, the accerciser window is very small, forcing a resize.
2014-03-18T19:12:31 <jhernandez> clown: this was already fixed in master
2014-03-18T19:12:46 <clown> really?  I thought I was working with master.

2014-03-18T19:13:39 <jhernandez> are you running it into a jhbuild environment?
2014-03-18T19:14:22 <clown> no, I simply make and make install, and then run it.
2014-03-18T19:14:37 <jhernandez> mmmm
2014-03-18T19:14:41 <clown> I\'m on master.  Last commit was today with comment "Marked as 3.12.0pr"
2014-03-18T19:14:59 <clown> I\'ve since added my change to the interface viewer.
2014-03-18T19:15:24 <clown> *Marked as 3.12.0pre
2014-03-18T19:15:27 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-03-18T19:16:49 <clown> maybe I\'ll file a bugzilla later on in the week.
2014-03-18T19:18:09 <jhernandez> clown: sure, maybe the problem is that \'Quit\' action doesn\'t triggers the delete-event
2014-03-18T19:18:40 <clown> possibly *pretends to know what jhernandez is talking about*
2014-03-18T19:18:47 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-18T19:18:50 <clown> ;-)
2014-03-18T19:19:14 <clown> anyhow, you wanted to discuss packagekitBridge and making a change>
2014-03-18T19:19:16 <clown> ?
2014-03-18T19:19:48 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:20:20 * clown scrolls up
2014-03-18T19:20:51 <jhernandez> just wanted to include an additional method to grab all the packages
2014-03-18T19:21:05 <clown> isn\'t that what searchPackage() does now?
2014-03-18T19:21:09 <jhernandez> either if they\'re installed or not, by using filters
2014-03-18T19:21:13 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-18T19:22:34 <jhernandez> more or less
2014-03-18T19:23:08 <jhernandez> we can ask for certain package(s), but not for all the packages (either if they\'re installed or not)
2014-03-18T19:23:09 <clown> I hear a "but" in there somewhere.
2014-03-18T19:23:41 <clown> I thought if the filter was \'none\' you got everything (installed and not installed).
2014-03-18T19:23:54 <clown> and if you pass nothing in for the filter, it defaults to \'none\'.
2014-03-18T19:24:01 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:24:17 <jhernandez> but what about getting all the packages installed on the system?
2014-03-18T19:24:47 <clown> oh, I see.
2014-03-18T19:24:51 * clown thinks
2014-03-18T19:24:51 <jhernandez> but it\'s not possible to do a pk.searchPackages("*", "installed")
2014-03-18T19:25:24 <clown> shoot.
2014-03-18T19:25:45 <clown> shoot about the "*".
2014-03-18T19:26:43 <clown> this might be related.  I was modifiying search packages to take multiple names.
2014-03-18T19:26:49 * clown looks up test case.
2014-03-18T19:27:57 <jhernandez> by using pkcon, you can get them by running \'pkcon --filter installed get-packages\'
2014-03-18T19:28:35 <clown> Like this:  pk.searchPackage ("tuxguitar tuxguitarZ");
2014-03-18T19:28:45 <clown> oh, neat.
2014-03-18T19:29:20 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:29:48 <clown> how did you find that out?
2014-03-18T19:30:11 * clown has the source of pkcon on his desk beside him.
2014-03-18T19:30:34 <jhernandez> burn it! xDD
2014-03-18T19:31:13 <jhernandez> in client/pk-console.c
2014-03-18T19:31:28 <jhernandez> look for "get-packages"
2014-03-18T19:31:34 * clown does not see a "installed" command \xe2\x80\xa6 oh!
2014-03-18T19:32:05 <jhernandez> installed is the filter
2014-03-18T19:32:22 <jhernandez> \'pkcon get-packages --filter installed\'
2014-03-18T19:32:24 <jhernandez> better?
2014-03-18T19:32:38 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-18T19:32:52 <clown> right, but get-packages is the command.
2014-03-18T19:33:06 <clown> I found it on the last page of the source.
2014-03-18T19:33:06 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:33:31 <clown> so, have you written this?  Or do you want me to give it a try?
2014-03-18T19:34:09 <jhernandez> haven\'t coded it yet
2014-03-18T19:34:35 * clown is trying \'pkcon get-packages \xe2\x80\x94filter newer\'
2014-03-18T19:35:08 <jhernandez> if you can/want write, it I\'m ok with that
2014-03-18T19:35:11 <clown> *newest
2014-03-18T19:35:18 <clown> it\'s taking a long time.
2014-03-18T19:35:23 <clown> I\'m willing.
2014-03-18T19:35:34 <jhernandez> cool!
2014-03-18T19:35:37 <clown> Just wondering what the test case looks like.
2014-03-18T19:35:43 <clown> the unit test, I mean.
2014-03-18T19:35:58 <jhernandez> still not sure
2014-03-18T19:36:18 <jhernandez> but, pkcon get-packages output is as follows
2014-03-18T19:36:29 <jhernandez> "Installed   zypper-log-1.9.6-8.1.noarch             CLI for accessing the zypper logfile"
2014-03-18T19:36:47 <clown> well, my "pkcon get-packages \xe2\x80\x94filter newest" just returned.
2014-03-18T19:36:49 <clown> Long list...
2014-03-18T19:37:15 <jhernandez> and I\'d like to return a JSON object in the same way we\'re already doing in our searchPackage method
2014-03-18T19:37:21 <clown> e.g.,
2014-03-18T19:37:23 <clown> "Available   \tzzuf-0.13-7.20100215.fc20.x86_64        \tTransparent application input fuzzer"
2014-03-18T19:37:46 <clown> Re: the JSON object \xe2\x80\x94 of course.  Makes sens.
2014-03-18T19:37:53 <clown> sense even.
2014-03-18T19:38:43 <jhernandez> yeah, something similar to { id: \'orca;3.10.2-4.5;i586;installed\', name: \'orca\', version: \'3.10.2-4.5\', data: \'installed\' }
2014-03-18T19:39:34 <clown> I\'m thinking I can probably steal from what\'s in searchPackages() now.  In fact, it may be possible (needs more thought) to modify searchPackages() to do this.
2014-03-18T19:40:03 <clown> On seccond thought, I think we need a new function getPackages().
2014-03-18T19:41:04 <clown> since (based on the pkcon code) it will call the get_packages_sync() packagekit library method.
2014-03-18T19:41:08 <jhernandez> I\'m not sure what\'s the best, I\'m at this same point
2014-03-18T19:41:40 <jhernandez> (that\'s the reason I am asking) :)
2014-03-18T19:41:44 <clown> well, I\'ll try to get something done by end of day, and leave you with a pull request.
2014-03-18T19:41:52 <jhernandez> wow
2014-03-18T19:41:55 * clown such optimism...
2014-03-18T19:42:11 <clown> no test case, though.
2014-03-18T19:42:15 <jhernandez> that would be great
2014-03-18T19:42:15 <clown> that\'s the tough part.
2014-03-18T19:42:18 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:42:37 <clown> tough because there is "no" known expected result.
2014-03-18T19:43:05 <jhernandez> yeah, but we do like challenges!
2014-03-18T19:43:06 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-03-18T19:43:12 <clown> okay.  I\'ll put my head down and get at it.
2014-03-18T19:43:30 <clown> I have a little more than an hour before I have to leave.
2014-03-18T19:43:57 <jhernandez> clown: you don\'t have to start working on this right now
2014-03-18T19:44:35 <clown> I don\'t mind.  I don\'t have anything else pressing.  And, I like the challenge.
2014-03-18T19:44:41 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-18T19:44:44 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-03-18T19:44:52 <jhernandez> I also like this challenge too
2014-03-18T19:45:19 <jhernandez> nodeje.js + c++ + no known expected results
2014-03-18T19:45:22 <clown> If I don\'t do this, I go back to fiddling with changes to searchPackage(), but I think this \'get-packages\' think if more useful.
2014-03-18T19:45:24 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-03-18T19:45:44 <clown> *but I think this \'get-packages\' thing is more useful.
2014-03-18T19:45:55 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T19:46:52 <jhernandez> the point is that I\'ve been thinking a lot about the whole device reporter story
2014-03-18T19:47:04 <clown> I\'m getting somewhat used to node.js + c++.  It\'s the server side of things that is still confusing.  How are we going to make use of this packageKitBridge as part of the actual device reporter?
2014-03-18T19:47:31 <clown> ah, we are at the same state of confusion, you and I.
2014-03-18T19:47:36 <clown> :-)
2014-03-18T19:47:44 <jhernandez> this is what I\'m currently trying to sketch
2014-03-18T19:47:47 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-18T19:48:10 * SonicX joined the channel
2014-03-18T19:48:12 <clown> you go do that (the hard part).  I\'ll take a stab at get-packages (the easy part).
2014-03-18T19:48:14 <clown> Hah!
2014-03-18T19:48:19 <jhernandez> heh!
2014-03-18T19:48:20 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-03-18T19:49:38 <clown> btw, is your patch that uses UTF8 committed?

2014-03-18T17:35:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve pushed up my changes for FLOE-116 and merged in your fix for the tooltip strings
2014-03-18T17:35:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve left Bosmon8 a comment that it is ready for another round of code review
2014-03-18T17:35:31 <cindyli> that\'s great, thanks, Justin_o
2014-03-18T17:36:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: how are things going for you?
2014-03-18T17:36:43 <cindyli> still trying the transformations
2014-03-18T17:45:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. good luck

2014-03-18T18:37:26 <cindyli> Bosmon8 & kasparnet: does the model transformation support nested conditional transforms?
2014-03-18T18:37:28 <cindyli> http://pastie.org/8948286
2014-03-18T18:37:37 <cindyli> line 16 - 30
2014-03-18T18:38:17 <cindyli> of course, the nested block in this example doesn\'t work. is there another way to achieve the same goal?
2014-03-18T18:38:37 <kasparnet> cindyli: yes, nested conditional transforms _should_ work
2014-03-18T18:38:47 * kasparnet is just looking at your example
2014-03-18T18:38:54 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2014-03-18T18:40:16 <kasparnet> cindyli: so in the example, line 21-23 and 26-29 should be wrapped in a "transform"
2014-03-18T18:40:28 <kasparnet> but besides that, doesn\'t it work?
2014-03-18T18:40:38 <cindyli> ah ha. trying...
2014-03-18T18:40:45 * jhung has quit
2014-03-18T18:42:09 <cindyli> good catch, kasparnet. it\'s now working perfectly. thanks!
2014-03-18T18:46:21 <jhernandez> clown: sorry, I left for some errands
2014-03-18T18:46:23 <jhernandez> here again
2014-03-18T18:46:38 <clown> jhernandez:  hi.  welcome back.
2014-03-18T18:47:17 <jhernandez> just wanted to ask you to try this -> http://pastebin.com/8nwKEAsF
2014-03-18T18:47:41 <kasparnet> cindyli: cool
2014-03-18T18:48:35 * jash4 joined the channel
2014-03-18T18:48:55 <jhernandez> clown: just to ensure that tests are passing well
2014-03-18T18:49:14 <clown> okay, is that a patch?
2014-03-18T18:49:20 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T18:49:28 * clown guesses he has to stash some stuff again...
2014-03-18T18:49:57 <jhernandez> for our packageKit stuff - basically, fixes a segfault here in my openSUSE
2014-03-18T18:50:58 <jhernandez> (which I can\'t reproduce in Fedora)
2014-03-18T18:52:41 <clown> oh right, that.  Okay.
2014-03-18T18:53:15 <clown> I will patch my local copy of your branch (packagekitBridge) here, and try it out, jhernandez
2014-03-18T18:53:26 <jhernandez> clown: thanks!
2014-03-18T18:54:05 <clown> jhernandez:  is it a matter of taken your diff from the paste, and using patch and/or git-patch?
2014-03-18T18:54:09 <clown> *taking
2014-03-18T18:54:24 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-18T18:54:43 <jhernandez> just grab it and run a git apply <filename>
2014-03-18T18:55:19 <clown> okay.
2014-03-18T18:56:50 <jhernandez> btw, I\'d like to add a new method to our packageKit module
