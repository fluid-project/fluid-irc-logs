2014-04-29T13:51:28 <jhung> Justin_o: I have not been able to reproduce the gap you are seeing in the overviewPanel header. Is it specifically the UIO demo or all demos? Which browsers? Have you tried changing your scrollbar settings? I looks like it\'s a gap reserved for a vertical scroll.
2014-04-29T13:52:58 <cindyli> ok, michelled

2014-04-29T14:13:50 <jhung> anastasiac: I was thinking about the new changes to the icons + links in the overviewPanel, and I wonder if this will be an opportunity to address FLUID-5318 (links should be configurable issue) as well?
2014-04-29T14:14:22 <anastasiac> jhung, if we can manage it, that would be great, but that\'s a bit more technically involved
2014-04-29T14:16:00 <jhung> anastasiac: true. I guess I\'ll create a separate jira for the task and see where we get.
2014-04-29T14:17:30 <jhung> also if you get a chance anastasiac, can you test FLUID-5338 and share your thoughts? It seems rather severe, but it doesn\'t happen all the time.

2014-04-29T14:27:21 <Justin_o> i turned the scroll bars on to see, but the scroll bar doesn\'t go to that part of the UI
2014-04-29T14:29:11 <jhung> strange Justin_o. Does specifying a width: 100% on the .fl-overviewPanel-title container fix the problem?
2014-04-29T14:35:09 <Justin_o> jhung: nope, then it\'s too big
2014-04-29T14:35:47 * yzen joined the channel
2014-04-29T14:36:18 <jhung> hmmm. okay. I\'ll play around and see if I can reproduce it Justin_o.

2014-04-29T15:11:49 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'m not able to reproduce FLUID-5338. I turned off my browser cache and tried it a dozen times; never happened
2014-04-29T15:12:03 <anastasiac> sorry; turned ON my cache
2014-04-29T15:12:24 <jhung> using firefox anastasiac and the github link?
2014-04-29T15:12:33 <anastasiac> eyp
2014-04-29T15:12:36 <anastasiac> yep
2014-04-29T15:12:39 * anastasiac can\'t type today
2014-04-29T15:12:53 <jhung> weird. Justin_o and I were able to reproduce it. This only makes it stranger.

2014-04-29T15:15:35 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac: it might have been related to firebug for me
2014-04-29T15:16:50 <jhung> Justin_o: i\'ll disable it and see.

2014-04-29T15:19:21 <jhung> Justin_o: Ah. It seems just by closing firebug (not even disabling it) fixes it. Reopening firebug I can\'t seem to reproduce the problem anymore.

2014-04-29T15:50:10 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. i\'ll try again

2014-04-29T15:51:42 <Justin_o> jhung: that looks better but i\'m getting this error now "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://localhost:8888/git/infusion/src/components/overviewPanel/css/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf"
2014-04-29T15:52:01 <jhung> Justin_o:  ok i\'ll check
2014-04-29T15:52:54 <jhung> darn caching. I never know when these issues are fixed.
2014-04-29T15:53:25 <Justin_o> jhung: i think the path is wrong
2014-04-29T15:53:49 <jhung> yep
2014-04-29T15:53:51 <Justin_o> jhung: the file is in the fonts directory that is a child of overviewPanel, not of css
2014-04-29T15:54:01 <jhung> dont
2014-04-29T15:54:03 <jhung> done
2014-04-29T15:54:08 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-04-29T15:55:27 <Justin_o> jhung: same problem.. i think there may have been two references to it
2014-04-29T15:56:10 * jhung sigh
2014-04-29T15:57:09 <jhung> Justin_o: third time is a charm? try now
2014-04-29T15:58:54 <Justin_o> jhung: looks good.. that seemed to do the trick
2014-04-29T15:59:06 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, is the "*" supposed to be underlined in the contrast themes?
2014-04-29T16:00:14 <jhung> Justin_o: yes I left it that way to emphasize it\'s interactive since we lose link colours in contrast modes.
2014-04-29T16:00:24 <Justin_o> jhung: cool, thanks
2014-04-29T16:00:38 <Justin_o> jhung: does vjoanna still need to look it over?
2014-04-29T16:00:57 <jhung> Did she look at it earlier Justin_o?

2014-04-29T16:01:33 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2014-04-29T16:01:38 <jhung> thanks
2014-04-29T16:02:05 <Justin_o> jhung: so i guess it might have to wait till tomorrow then
2014-04-29T16:02:13 <Justin_o> i\'ll look over the code again in the mean time though
2014-04-29T16:02:47 <jhung> thanks Justin_o.

2014-04-29T17:03:26 <jhung> colinclark, michelled, anastasiac, cindyli, Justin_o: In yesterday\'s discussion about adding a "Demo Code" link to the overview panel, what should the destination be? Demo code on github?
2014-04-29T17:03:39 <colinclark> Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable place to link to
2014-04-29T17:06:18 <jhung> this leads me to my next question (which vjoanna and danaayotte_ may be able to help with). If we have both a "Demo Code" and "Get Infusion" links and both point to github, using a github icon for one and not the other may be confusing. Perhaps we can put a "On github" group and put these two as text links?
2014-04-29T17:07:02 <jhung> ^this is in reference to adding two new links to the Overview Panel. We would remove the github "code" link, and replace it with 2 new ones.
2014-04-29T17:08:01 <danaayotte_> what do you mean by putting an "On github" group jhung?
2014-04-29T17:08:48 <jhung> danaayotte_: a visual container of some sort to indicate that the links are related. Typically it appears as a shaded row or box.
2014-04-29T17:09:03 * jessm has quit
2014-04-29T17:10:05 <jhung> I was thinking something like <github icon> On github: Demo Code   Get Infusion
2014-04-29T17:10:13 * jessm joined the channel
2014-04-29T17:15:10 <anastasiac> jhung, sorry I\'m late coming in to this.
2014-04-29T17:15:24 <anastasiac> I think the github icon on just the \'get infusion\' link is ok
2014-04-29T17:15:55 <anastasiac> I suspect that people have an association with the icon, that it represents where to go for the project
2014-04-29T17:16:13 <anastasiac> I think the fact that the demo code happens to also be on github isn\'t really an important thing to convey
2014-04-29T17:16:23 <anastasiac> they\'ll figure it out as soon as they follow the link
2014-04-29T17:16:28 <anastasiac> what do you think, jhun?
2014-04-29T17:16:30 <anastasiac> jhung
2014-04-29T17:17:46 <jhung> So a different icon would be okay for the demo code link anastasiac? Not even sure what an appropriate icon would be. Maybe a set of curly brackets? { }
2014-04-29T17:18:22 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, I was thinking a different icon for the demo code link, and curly brackets does sound like a good idea
2014-04-29T17:19:24 <danaayotte_> +1 jhung, anastasiac
2014-04-29T17:19:54 <jhung> danaayotte_, anastasiac - thanks. that makes it easier.
