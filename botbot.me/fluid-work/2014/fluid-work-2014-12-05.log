2014-12-05T14:47:47 <kasparne_> Bosmon: I tried giving nick a bit of support on kettle - he tried to use some 3rd party libraries first, which screwed up the requestProxy of kettle/infusion
2014-12-05T14:47:55 <kasparne_> I sent him this: https://code.stypi.com/kaspermarkus/Nick%20support.js
2014-12-05T14:48:02 <kasparne_> to try out  -but there is some issue with it
2014-12-05T14:48:08 <kasparne_> he can probably explain it better
2014-12-05T14:48:13 <kasparne_> gotta run now unfortunately
2014-12-05T14:48:25 <kasparne_> will ping him to get back online if he hasn\'t already left for the day

2014-12-05T14:53:18 <Bosmon> He seems to be gone
2014-12-05T14:53:23 <Bosmon> Do you know what he is trying to do?

2014-12-05T15:03:58 <Nick_Kaklanis> Kasper tried to help me with the RBMM integration but I still need some help to make it work
2014-12-05T15:04:19 <Nick_Kaklanis> so...if you look at this: https://code.stypi.com/kaspermarkus/Nick%20support.js
2014-12-05T15:04:54 <Nick_Kaklanis> I have a problem in line 66, saying that this object has no "set" method
2014-12-05T15:05:00 <Nick_Kaklanis> can anyone help?
2014-12-05T15:07:01 <Bosmon> Hi there Nick_Kaklanis - thanks for the question
2014-12-05T15:07:18 <Nick_Kaklanis> thank you for helping me!
2014-12-05T15:07:18 <Bosmon> You need to supply the "writable: true" option to the dataSource
2014-12-05T15:07:22 <Bosmon> You can see an example at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesServer.js#L62

2014-12-05T18:07:50 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2014-12-05T18:08:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. wondering if it is intentional that the renderer strips off id\'s from a form element
2014-12-05T18:09:07 <Justin_o> here\'s some markup i have
2014-12-05T18:09:12 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/gX4zpVYy
2014-12-05T18:09:55 * jhung joined the channel
2014-12-05T18:09:58 <Justin_o> there is no selector for the form in the component that does the rendering, but the id is used to identify a submit input with it that lives outside the form.. however, when run through the renderer the id is removed from the form
2014-12-05T18:11:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what type of component in your renderer tree is peering with the form?
2014-12-05T18:11:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: none, it\'s not used by the renderer at all
2014-12-05T18:12:24 <Justin_o> however the input labels and inputs themselves are set by the renderer
2014-12-05T18:12:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - in that case all ids are removed - since the renderer can\'t know that you aren\'t reusing the same template elsewhere in the document and hence causing the ids to collide
2014-12-05T18:12:40 <Justin_o> i\'m really only using the renderer for setting strings
2014-12-05T18:13:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i put an id on the div inside the form and that was preserved
2014-12-05T18:13:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - which one?
2014-12-05T18:14:18 <Justin_o> i removed it from the code i showed you, but if i put an id on div on line 6 it will remain after rendering
2014-12-05T18:18:21 <Bosmon> ok
2014-12-05T18:18:43 <Justin_o> any thoughts?
2014-12-05T18:19:34 * anastasiac has quit
2014-12-05T18:26:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, I can\'t think of a reason
2014-12-05T18:26:46 <Bosmon> Is it definitely gone from the textual form of the template before it hits the document?
2014-12-05T18:30:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. i didn\'t check that.. i\'ll try to take a look at that
