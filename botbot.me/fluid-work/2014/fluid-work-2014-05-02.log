2014-05-02T18:04:59 <cindyli> }
2014-05-02T18:05:07 <cindyli> the other is using modelRelay option
2014-05-02T18:05:21 <cindyli> if both of them are presented in the same component, which one will take precedent?
2014-05-02T18:05:38 <cindyli> or they are conflicting with each other?
2014-05-02T18:07:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - you shouldn\'t set up two rules between the same two endpoints
2014-05-02T18:08:00 <Bosmon> But if the endpoints are different, the rules should merge together fine
2014-05-02T18:08:19 <cindyli> cool, thanks, Bosmon
2014-05-02T18:08:52 <Bosmon> There\'s not any way to cancel or unregister a rule separately from destroying the component which holds it

2014-05-02T18:29:37 <jhernandez> Bosmon: sgithens I\'ll be around, so if you need anything from me to book the third appartment, just ping me
2014-05-02T18:41:47 <Bosmon> sgithens - yes, we\'re all booked in

2014-05-02T18:44:35 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2014-05-02T18:45:26 <cindyli> btw, Bosmon, is the pull request for FLOE-116 ready to be merged?
2014-05-02T18:45:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - it looks good, yes
2014-05-02T18:45:43 <Bosmon> I should just test it a bit now
2014-05-02T18:45:52 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon
2014-05-02T18:46:22 <Bosmon> cindyli - have you had a chance to look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/484 ?
2014-05-02T18:47:06 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon, i tried and it works pretty well
2014-05-02T18:47:14 <cindyli> writing a comment on the pull
2014-05-02T18:47:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool
2014-05-02T18:47:49 <Bosmon> In order to deal with the chunk of code you pasted, you\'ll need to rewrite fluid.metadata.panel.transformPanelModel as a model transformation transform
2014-05-02T18:52:00 <cindyli> yes, understand, Bosmon. the problem we have is how to accommodate different input type. there could be three inputs from the parent panel component:
2014-05-02T18:52:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can just use the same implementation you have now
2014-05-02T18:52:26 <cindyli> oh, i see
2014-05-02T18:52:42 <cindyli> can we replace the whole thing with modelRelay option?
2014-05-02T18:52:53 <Bosmon> cindyli - except for the inverse rule, as we discussed previously
2014-05-02T18:53:08 <sgithens> Bosmon: Awesome
2014-05-02T18:53:11 <Bosmon> YOu will write the forward rule as a modelRelay rule using a single large transformer
2014-05-02T18:53:15 <Bosmon> The reverse rule can stay the way it is
2014-05-02T18:53:24 <cindyli> we don\'t need to invert back to the panel
2014-05-02T18:53:26 <sgithens> which is probably good, so I have enough credit to book the plane ticket
2014-05-02T18:54:59 <cindyli> Bosmon: reverse rule, there\'s no reverse rule in here
2014-05-02T18:57:37 <cindyli> Bosmon: the problem is it\'s difficult to use one model relay to handle different input from the parent panel component.
2014-05-02T18:58:23 <cindyli> from line 71, the panel has a "indicatorModelRules" option that basically provides the modelRelay
2014-05-02T18:58:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can just write a transform rule of the normal kind
2014-05-02T18:58:45 <Bosmon> In this case the input consists of the entire model
2014-05-02T18:58:54 <Bosmon> And the options to the transform rule consists of the indicatorModelRules
2014-05-02T19:01:49 <Bosmon> Ah, I see that indicatorModelRules just consists of transforms
2014-05-02T19:02:10 <Bosmon> So, you may as well just get rid of that configuration block, and have the users write a modelRelay block instead
2014-05-02T19:02:25 <cindyli> Bosmon: in the case that the transformation rule is the direct mapping btw two elements, such as { value: "{panel}.model.value" }, how do we write the modelRelay
2014-05-02T19:03:09 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-05-02T19:03:20 <cindyli> once the modelRelay in place, we will always need to write a relay even for the direct mapping, right?
2014-05-02T19:04:09 <Bosmon> Well..... you could just set up a relay rule using fluid.identity
2014-05-02T19:04:40 <cindyli> by using "fluid.transforms.free"? that\'s a good point
2014-05-02T19:04:53 <Bosmon> You can even just use fluid.identity directly
2014-05-02T19:05:04 <cindyli> ah. good to know
2014-05-02T19:05:08 <Bosmon> Any function that is not otherwise recognised is interpreted as a "standardTransformFunction"
2014-05-02T19:05:22 <Bosmon> so a transform rule of type: "fluid.identity" should be fine
2014-05-02T19:05:42 <cindyli> trying..
2014-05-02T19:07:09 <Bosmon> You can see these lines in ModelTransformation.js, line 231
2014-05-02T19:07:12 <Bosmon> if (!fluid.hasGrade(expdef, "fluid.transformFunction")) {
2014-05-02T19:07:12 <Bosmon> expdef = fluid.defaults("fluid.standardTransformFunction");
2014-05-02T19:07:12 <Bosmon> }
2014-05-02T19:07:44 <Bosmon> There\'s actually a comment there
2014-05-02T19:07:49 <Bosmon> But it didn\'t come through on IRC : P
2014-05-02T19:08:00 <Bosmon> It read "   // If no suitable grade is set up, assume that it is intended to be used as a standardTransformFunction"
2014-05-02T19:09:52 <cindyli> ok. tried this but doesn\'t work - http://pastie.org/9134474
2014-05-02T19:10:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - you didn\'t specify any input!
2014-05-02T19:10:50 <cindyli> Bosmon: the input is "model" variable
2014-05-02T19:11:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - you didn\'t specify any input to the transform rule
2014-05-02T19:11:58 <cindyli> what do you mean\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.
2014-05-02T19:12:09 <cindyli> :/
2014-05-02T19:12:15 <cindyli> :)
2014-05-02T19:12:39 <Bosmon> Remember this? : P
2014-05-02T19:12:40 <Bosmon> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5294
2014-05-02T19:12:45 <Bosmon> You need to specify a value for "input"
2014-05-02T19:12:48 <Bosmon> For the transform rule
2014-05-02T19:12:53 <Bosmon> Either input, or inputPath
2014-05-02T19:13:16 <Bosmon> If you\'re going to use it in IoC, you would use an IoC expression as "input"
2014-05-02T19:13:23 <Bosmon> If you use it standalone, you would write a model path in "inputPath"
2014-05-02T19:15:25 <cindyli> ah ha. you are my hero. yes, adding inputPath. i thought the whole model would be assumed as the input if an explicit input is provided
2014-05-02T19:15:47 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t work that way... you need to explicitly specify what the input is
2014-05-02T19:16:28 <cindyli> ok
2014-05-02T19:16:53 <Bosmon> I guess we could make an improvement to the framework that if neither input nor inputPath is specified, it defaults to an inputPath of ""
2014-05-02T19:17:31 <cindyli> +100! smart!

2014-05-02T19:22:44 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2014-05-02T19:35:20 <Bosmon> cindyli
2014-05-02T19:35:25 <Bosmon> I\'m testing out the metadata component
2014-05-02T19:35:30 <Bosmon> How do I actually complete the wizard?
2014-05-02T19:35:47 <cindyli> are you at the index page, index.html?
2014-05-02T19:35:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - I was
2014-05-02T19:36:09 <Bosmon> But then when I clicked on "Create new resource" it took me to a new page
2014-05-02T19:36:16 <Bosmon> resource.html
2014-05-02T19:36:16 <cindyli> exactly
2014-05-02T19:36:20 <Bosmon> From which I seem to be unable to return
2014-05-02T19:36:31 <cindyli> restart demo link
2014-05-02T19:36:41 <cindyli> top right corner
2014-05-02T19:36:50 <Bosmon> well yes
2014-05-02T19:36:55 <Bosmon> But that doesn\'t actually cause any resources to be added
2014-05-02T19:37:51 <cindyli> it doesn\'t really add any other resources. the demo just shows scenarios of adding or editing content
2014-05-02T19:37:59 <Bosmon> I see
2014-05-02T19:38:11 <Bosmon> ok
2014-05-02T19:38:24 <Bosmon> Well, it would be nice and I imagine not too much trouble in future to have an end-to-end demo
2014-05-02T19:38:33 <Bosmon> We do after all seem to have the pouchDBDataSource....
2014-05-02T19:38:47 <cindyli> yes, agree
2014-05-02T19:38:56 <Bosmon> Ok, this looks reasonable, merging now
2014-05-02T19:39:04 <cindyli> yay! thanks!
2014-05-02T19:39:19 <Bosmon> Two things re the overview component i) it would be nice to have a tooltip, ii) it would be nice to have it use our "globalDismissal" facility to close itself
2014-05-02T19:40:14 <cindyli> the opening/closing of the overview panel is tracked until the restart is clicked, Bosmon
2014-05-02T19:40:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - what do you mean by "tracked"?
2014-05-02T19:41:41 <cindyli> the first time you visit the index page, the overview panel is open. if you close it and click on the edit or create, you are redirected to resource page and the overview panel stays closed
2014-05-02T19:42:22 <cindyli> isn\'t this want you want by ii) close itself?
2014-05-02T19:42:34 <cindyli> the first "want" -> what
2014-05-02T19:43:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - I mean, it should have the affordance to close itself simply by clicking outside itself, rather than only being closable from the "close" button
2014-05-02T19:43:49 <cindyli> ah. i see. agree
2014-05-02T19:43:50 <Bosmon> This is what our "global dismissal" component does
2014-05-02T19:44:13 <Bosmon> Invented for use in ......... CEE SPACE!
2014-05-02T19:44:54 <cindyli> do you want me to create jiras for your i) and ii)?

2014-05-02T19:48:23 <cindyli> i) it would be nice to have a tooltip, ii) it would be nice to have it use our "globalDismissal" facility to close itself
2014-05-02T19:49:17 <cindyli> "globalDissmissal" means - it should have the affordance to close itself simply by clicking outside itself, rather than only being closable from the "close" button
2014-05-02T19:49:19 <jhung> i). Yes! Tooltip would be fantastic.
2014-05-02T19:49:59 <jhung> ii). Yes x2! vjoanna and I were talking about this the other day. We\'ll file a new jira for it.
2014-05-02T19:50:16 <cindyli> cool. on ur shoulder, jhung. :) thanks

2014-05-02T13:44:29 <jhung> Justin_o: thanks.
2014-05-02T13:49:25 <jhung> As for the headers of the overview panel showing up in the table of contents - I guess this is an issue because if the panel is hidden, the headers are not visible. So selecting the item in the TOC won\'t put focus to the header in the overview panel.
2014-05-02T13:49:30 <jhung> ^Justin_o
2014-05-02T13:49:45 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, that\'s correct
2014-05-02T13:50:18 <Justin_o> jhung: the strange thing is that they aren\'t supposed to show headers that are hidden, when it is enabled.
2014-05-02T13:50:47 <Justin_o> jhung: actually that does work properly
2014-05-02T13:51:38 <Justin_o> jhung: so things that are hidden after it is turned on, will still show up in the list.. i don\'t know what we could do about that though.. it\'s a limitation with the ToC enactor
2014-05-02T13:52:01 <Justin_o> jhung: what do you think?
2014-05-02T14:00:36 <jhung> Justin_o: Part of me thinks that ToC should be aware of changes and update accordingly.
2014-05-02T14:01:44 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-05-02T14:04:37 <Justin_o> jhung: that would make sense, although it might not be very performant to monitor all of the activity on a page.
2014-05-02T14:04:53 <Justin_o> jhung: i think the ToC may be completely rethought in new designs though
2014-05-02T14:05:20 <cindyli> Justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5342 lists a bunch of other jiras, which tests it\'s intended to fix?

2014-05-02T14:05:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: those were actually the names of the tests that are failing.. the tests happen to be named after jiras
2014-05-02T14:06:20 <cindyli> oh, i see
2014-05-02T14:06:38 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. So where does this leave us with respect to the overviewPanel? Is there a way to prevent ToC from indexing a header?
2014-05-02T14:07:26 <Justin_o> jhung: ys
2014-05-02T14:07:27 <Justin_o> yes
2014-05-02T14:08:44 <jhung> Justin_o: Cool. Maybe we\'ll do that as a temporary fix.
2014-05-02T14:08:44 <Justin_o> jhung: this is how it finds the headers now https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tableOfContents/js/TableOfContents.js#L111
2014-05-02T14:09:13 <Justin_o> jhung: we\'d have to modify that, but it would mean that they never show up in the table of contents
2014-05-02T14:10:18 <Justin_o> jhung: if we do make this change, we\'ll need to have it work for all of the prefsFramework demos that have overviewPanels.
2014-05-02T14:10:21 <jhung> I think that\'s fine Justin_o. The ToC should really apply to the demo content. The overviewPanel is something outside of the demo. It\'s more metadata than actual frmo content.
2014-05-02T14:10:31 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m inclined to just file a separate jira for this and worry about it later though
2014-05-02T14:10:34 <jhung> *frmo = demo.
2014-05-02T14:10:50 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2014-05-02T14:11:07 <jhung> Justin_o: makes sense to file another jira.

2014-05-02T14:17:37 <jhung> I\'m pushing up a fix for the font size issue now
2014-05-02T14:17:50 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-05-02T14:23:50 <Justin_o> jhung: here\'s the new jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5356

2014-05-02T14:50:05 <Justin_o> anastasiac: could you please review this pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/509
2014-05-02T14:50:26 <anastasiac> Sure, Justin_o
2014-05-02T14:50:49 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2014-05-02T15:10:30 <jhernandez> jessm: around?
2014-05-02T15:13:23 <jhernandez> sgithens: around?
2014-05-02T15:14:36 <jhernandez> just wondering if any of you has booked the 3rd appartment
2014-05-02T15:15:06 <jhernandez> catching up on email now after almost 3 days offline
2014-05-02T15:18:18 <Justin_o> jhung: i can\'t seem to reproduce http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5338
2014-05-02T15:18:52 <Justin_o> jhung: i remember having this issue before though. Firefox was recently updated, so it could have been a weird caching bug that has now gone away. Are you still able to reproduce it?
2014-05-02T15:19:46 <jhung> I was able to reproduce it Wednesday. Let me try again.
2014-05-02T15:23:35 <jhung> I was able to reproduce it now on FF Mac, but not FF Windows.
2014-05-02T15:23:52 <Justin_o> jhung: ah.. i was able to reproduce it now, but only when running the code locally and only with firebug open
2014-05-02T15:24:47 <jhung> I can reproduce it using the build site Justin_o on mac. such a weird bug. I don\'t think we can fix it either way. Just document it may be enough.
2014-05-02T15:25:04 <Justin_o> jhung: which version of Firefox are you using?
2014-05-02T15:25:27 <jhung> Justin_o: 28.0
2014-05-02T15:25:38 <jhung> It\'s downloading an update now though.
2014-05-02T15:25:48 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. i\'m trying with FF 29
2014-05-02T15:25:55 <Justin_o> you\'ll probably like this version better.. :)
2014-05-02T15:26:06 <Justin_o> but please let me know if you can still reproduce the issue
2014-05-02T15:27:40 <jhung> Ah. it\'s gone now Justin_o.
2014-05-02T15:28:22 <jhung> FF29 is pretty, but what happened to my tabs? They look nothing like tabs. I like it more tabby.
2014-05-02T15:29:19 <Justin_o> :) too round?
2014-05-02T15:30:07 <jhung> too flat. Tabs look like the old bookmark toolbar
2014-05-02T15:30:13 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, i\'ve left FLUID-5338 open with a comment about my experience and removed the fix for 1.5
2014-05-02T15:30:19 <jhung> k
2014-05-02T15:30:36 <Justin_o> jhung:  you mean the closed ones
2014-05-02T15:30:51 <jhung> yeah - the non-active ones Justin_o
2014-05-02T15:40:03 <Justin_o> jhung: :) yes, the non-active ones.. the closed ones aren\'t there at all ;)
2014-05-02T15:40:34 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, did you say at standup that your pull requests are ready again
2014-05-02T15:42:28 <jhung> yes Justin_o. Ready.
2014-05-02T15:46:40 <Justin_o> jhung: left you another comment https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/496
2014-05-02T15:46:47 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/496#issuecomment-42045985
2014-05-02T15:51:05 <jhung> thanks. Looking into that now Justin_o
2014-05-02T15:51:26 <Justin_o> jhung: is there a transition on linespacing in the overviewPanel?
2014-05-02T15:52:59 <jhung> Justin_o: There\'s a transition: all 0.2s ease on the container. So everything that changes gets transitioned.
2014-05-02T15:53:16 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2014-05-02T15:53:19 <Justin_o> looks good :)

2014-05-02T16:50:33 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I\'m confused about the applier\'s hasChangeSource() function. There are two, and the one the video player is using doesn\'t work :-)
2014-05-02T16:50:38 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L1577-1579
2014-05-02T16:50:47 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L1160-1162 (not working)
2014-05-02T16:50:56 <anastasiac> can you shed any light?
2014-05-02T16:51:46 <Bosmon> anastasiac - hasChangeSource has been discontinued as of the new relay system
2014-05-02T16:53:35 <Bosmon> I think it is now possible to do without it
2014-05-02T16:53:47 <anastasiac> Bosmon, how does it work now?
2014-05-02T16:54:18 <Bosmon> anastasiac - we now have pretty good "unchanged value detection" which seems powerful enough in all the cases we\'ve seen so far to prevent "indefinite value propagation"
2014-05-02T16:56:29 <anastasiac> Bosmon, how does this "unchanged value detection" work? For example, if the video player detects a change to the volume property of the mode, how can it tell whether or not that change was triggered by the "mute" property change?
2014-05-02T17:03:36 <Bosmon> anastasiac - we should be able to maintain two separate pieces of model state - that is, the volume settings, and a separate boolean value for "mute"
2014-05-02T17:03:43 <Bosmon> That should make all of this logic a good deal less tortuous
2014-05-02T17:04:06 <Bosmon> That is a float for the volume, and a boolean for mute
2014-05-02T17:05:01 <anastasiac> I admit, I\'m still sorting throught the connections, but there are interactions betweent the two: If the mute state is set to true, the volume must be set to 0 (and the previous volume noted) and vice versa; if the volume is set to 0 (via the slider), the mute should be set to true, and vice versa
2014-05-02T17:06:37 <anastasiac> I\'ll see if I can clean up the code in a way that knowing the source of the volume change doesn\'t matter...

2014-05-02T18:04:57 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, there are two forms of defining model relay, one is something like:
