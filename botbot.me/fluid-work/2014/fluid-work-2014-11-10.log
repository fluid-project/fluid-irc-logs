b'2014-11-10T18:55:12 <Bosmon> And then you\'ll compare that against the expected structure using assertDeepEq
2014-11-10T18:55:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s google\'s definition https://www.google.ca/#q=define:+merry+as+a+grig
2014-11-10T18:55:45 <Justin_o> which isn\'t very exciting
2014-11-10T18:56:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: because we don\'t care which ones actually returned, we just care that the value we want is returned by something
2014-11-10T18:56:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I thought we wanted to keep track of which requests were dropped
2014-11-10T18:56:55 <Justin_o> for testing purposes
2014-11-10T18:57:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - we can determine which requests were dropped by actually looking at the results
2014-11-10T18:57:18 <Bosmon> Clearly those requests which are dropped are the ones which don\'t return
2014-11-10T18:57:29 <Bosmon> And this method has the extra benefit of testing the real implementation
2014-11-10T18:57:55 <Bosmon> Rather than testing a structure of events which may have implementation bugs of its own
2014-11-10T18:58:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, but i still don\'t see how we know which request is dropped for a get request on a model that increments. Wouldn\'t we just know the number of requests that were dropped as opposed to which of them were
2014-11-10T18:58:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, WE issue each request - and we get its return value!
2014-11-10T18:58:46 <Bosmon> Clearly we can know, by looking at its return value, whether it has got one
2014-11-10T18:58:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m sure i\'m missing something here
2014-11-10T18:59:05 <Bosmon> The model that increments is just an extra courtesy to assure that the request hit the model at the right time
2014-11-10T18:59:18 <Justin_o> i issue three get requests.. lets say request 2 is dropped. the return from the model will be {count: 1} and then {count: 2}
2014-11-10T18:59:28 <Justin_o> how do i prove that request 2 was dropped but not request 1 or 3
2014-11-10T18:59:38 <Bosmon> !
2014-11-10T18:59:44 <Bosmon> Because the promise for request 2 has not resolved!
2014-11-10T19:00:06 <Justin_o> i see you want explicit assertions on each of the requests
2014-11-10T19:00:22 <Justin_o> okay doable
2014-11-10T19:00:38 <Bosmon> Yes, only by testing the values returned by the requests can we actually test what the implementation behaviour is
2014-11-10T19:00:45 <Justin_o> sure
2014-11-10T19:00:49 <Bosmon> Since it is the values returned by the requests that form the API we expose to our users
2014-11-10T19:00:49 * simonjb_ joined the channel
2014-11-10T19:01:49 <Justin_o> okay
2014-11-10T19:01:50 * simonjb has quit
2014-11-10T19:01:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: next.. for the events
2014-11-10T19:02:01 * simonjb_ is now known as simonjb
2014-11-10T19:02:18 <Justin_o> i\'m actually using enqueued to know when to start
2014-11-10T19:02:34 <Justin_o> perhaps i should actually remove dropped and onRequestStart
2014-11-10T19:03:04 <Justin_o> enqueued says, somethings been added to the queue, see if you are busy processing a request and if not trigger it.
2014-11-10T19:03:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I think you can probably remove all the events from the queue
2014-11-10T19:03:19 <Bosmon> That is, the "external"-ish ones
2014-11-10T19:03:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. sure.. i\'ll do that too
2014-11-10T19:03:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how did the actual implementation look aside from the events?
2014-11-10T19:04:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s looking good
2014-11-10T19:05:03 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-11-10T19:05:07 <Bosmon> If you can make your test structure fully declarative, it will make it easier to generate multiple tests from a "skeleton" without lots of cut and paste
2014-11-10T19:05:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks.. i\'ll try to fix up the tests and get back to you.
2014-11-10T19:05:18 <Bosmon> For example, you can run the "get" tests with lots of different combinations of delays
2014-11-10T19:05:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - great
2014-11-10T19:05:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. i\'ll have to think about that.. the idea sounds good.. i just don\'t have a clear picture in my head about how that structure will look yet.
2014-11-10T19:07:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, it will look very similar to the one you have now - only you can write an "even more compact structure" which comes before it, e.g. that just has the delays in it
2014-11-10T19:07:29 <Bosmon> Then take multiple copies of it that are the same apart from the delays, etc.
2014-11-10T19:09:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. things are clearing up.. so something like {get: [0, 20, 30, 40], set: [20, 40, 60], delete: [...]}
2014-11-10T19:09:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yup, just like that
2014-11-10T19:10:07 <Bosmon> Once everything is declarative, you can just connect it all up with "little machines"
2014-11-10T19:10:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks

2014-11-10T19:22:54 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok, all is passing in windows again now with my branch and nodejs 0.10.33
2014-11-10T19:23:18 <kasparnet> Bosmon: should I try reproducing your error in Linux?
2014-11-10T19:23:50 <Bosmon> xrandr one?
2014-11-10T19:25:06 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-11-10T19:26:47 <Bosmon> yes, thanks
2014-11-10T19:27:02 <kasparnet> ok - is it just the GPII-434 branch in linux?
2014-11-10T19:27:05 <Bosmon> I\'m still hacking on getting the Windows integration tests to run in Linux
2014-11-10T19:27:05 <kasparnet> Bosmon:
2014-11-10T19:27:10 <Bosmon> A little tougher than I thought
2014-11-10T19:27:14 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, that one
2014-11-10T19:27:17 <kasparnet> ok
2014-11-10T19:27:35 <Bosmon> It has VVERNANDDEZZ fix for the orca handler in it
2014-11-10T19:27:42 <Bosmon> And also I made a top-level driver "UnitTests.sh"
2014-11-10T19:27:54 <Bosmon> But I\'ve currently commented out the xrandr tests since they are crashing out for me
2014-11-10T19:39:46 <jhernandez> Bosmon: FYI, android is "almost" working
2014-11-10T19:39:47 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-10T19:40:04 <Bosmon> jhernandez that is "almost" COMPLETELY FANTASTIC!!
2014-11-10T19:40:11 <jhernandez> haha
2014-11-10T19:40:44 <kasparnet> lol
2014-11-10T19:44:42 <jhernandez> Bosmon: btw, the other day I made a photo for Rachel -> http://pasteboard.co/1BrKUzYx.jpg

2014-11-10T19:52:19 <anastasiac> jhung, did you still want me to continue trying to get the PhET sims running?
2014-11-10T19:52:50 <jhung> anastasiac: I don\'t think so. I\'ll send an email to the phet peeps and ask for help.
2014-11-10T19:52:58 <anastasiac> ok
2014-11-10T19:54:52 <Bosmon> OK, kasparnet, jhernandez - I have fixed up universal in my branch so that nvda integration tests run under both Windows and Linux
2014-11-10T19:55:02 <Bosmon> We will have to somehow back out of kasparnet\'s last commit to his branch
2014-11-10T19:55:17 <Bosmon> Perhaps we can just create a new branch from the revision one level back
2014-11-10T19:56:16 <kasparnet> ugh crap, sorry about that
2014-11-10T19:58:32 <Bosmon> Ok, so we can consider GPII-497 resolved as well
2014-11-10T19:58:42 <kasparnet> very nice!!
2014-11-10T19:58:45 <Bosmon> I\'ll just get some food and I need to write up an Infusion JIRA and some notes
2014-11-10T19:58:52 <kasparnet> ok
2014-11-10T19:58:55 <Bosmon> Since the scheme I had to use to resolve it was very crappy
2014-11-10T19:59:39 <Bosmon> I was struck by a sudden lightning bolt when working on this issue and it suddenly dawned on me how the ASYNCHRONOUS GINGER WORLD framework will actually work
2014-11-10T19:59:39 <kasparnet> would it be horrific if I just manually rolled back (ie. did an extra commit that changes back to original the changes I made re the GPII-497 issue)?
2014-11-10T20:00:05 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I guess it\'s fine - but I don\'t know what would happen if you merged - I guess git will just pick up the pieces
2014-11-10T20:00:15 <Bosmon> It generally does things which are broadly sensible, I find
2014-11-10T20:00:49 <Bosmon> I realised that PROMISES AREN\'T JUST FOR GENUINE ASYNCHRONY
2014-11-10T20:00:52 <kasparnet> great with the async GW - I thought it was halfway working already
2014-11-10T20:00:59 <Bosmon> Which is just as well, since our promises aren\'t genuinely asynchronous
2014-11-10T20:01:03 <Bosmon> No, it\'s not every started
2014-11-10T20:01:09 <Bosmon> not even started, I meant to say
2014-11-10T20:01:15 <Bosmon> We don\'t even have the WAVE OF EXPLOSIONS yet
2014-11-10T20:01:18 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok, I\'ll try with the rollback and see if I can still merge up with you
2014-11-10T20:01:38 <kasparnet> haha - can we wait with the explosions till post F2F?
2014-11-10T20:01:43 <Bosmon> This JIRA comes first - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4925
2014-11-10T20:01:55 <Bosmon> And then this one next: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4982
2014-11-10T20:02:04 <Bosmon> Well, more than that, we\'ll have to wait until after the review
2014-11-10T20:02:26 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-11-10T20:02:36 <Bosmon> I haven\'t even finished clearing out the blatant bugs in Infusion that Justin_o and cindyli have turned up in the months since I was intensively fixing the GPII junk
2014-11-10T20:02:38 <kasparnet> that sounds very good to me
2014-11-10T20:02:58 <Bosmon> But I can probably turn back to that for a bit next week
2014-11-10T20:03:09 <Bosmon> Since it looks like we may be able to reopen trunk very soon
2014-11-10T20:03:25 * kasparnet crossing his fingers
2014-11-10T20:03:37 <Bosmon> What\'s your tomorrow looking like?
2014-11-10T20:03:43 <Bosmon> Do we absolutely need to get it done this evening?
2014-11-10T20:03:49 <kasparnet> meeting at 15:00
2014-11-10T20:03:58 <kasparnet> and need to prep a presentation before then
2014-11-10T20:04:06 <Bosmon> We still need some Infusion review from colinclark
2014-11-10T20:04:18 <Bosmon> So we may have to try to slip it in tomorrow somehow
2014-11-10T20:04:21 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I think it\'s ok to wait until tomorrow
2014-11-10T20:04:24 <Bosmon> Especially if we want to do at least a little testing
2014-11-10T20:04:51 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-11-10T20:05:21 <Bosmon> The good news is at least we reopen trunk with about a dozen pull requests "pre-disposed" of
2014-11-10T20:05:38 <Bosmon> And several of the outstanding ones (e.g. DeviceReporter) we need to rethink a bit anyway
2014-11-10T20:07:29 * jhernandez hugs Bosmon for his gpii.settingsHandlers.numberify function
2014-11-10T20:07:31 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-10T20:07:39 <Bosmon> ha
2014-11-10T20:08:19 <Bosmon> Must be the first time someone has been hugged for something both at once so obscure and clumsy : P
2014-11-10T20:08:56 <Bosmon> There are actually quite a few gpii.settingsHandlers.* utilities that we can clean up a lot of our code with
2014-11-10T20:09:12 <Bosmon> Since so many of the settings handlers and their tests do so much redundant junk
2014-11-10T20:16:18 <kasparnet> Bosmon: Removed my crap, merged with your branch and everything is passing under mac
2014-11-10T20:16:29 <Bosmon> kasparnet - fantastic

2014-11-10T15:46:49 <anastasiac> oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s not good, jhung
2014-11-10T15:47:50 <jhung> If you have time today anastasiac, I was wondering if you can try going through a build from scratch? I wonder if it\'s just me.
2014-11-10T15:48:29 <anastasiac> sure, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try. Are you using the latest code from all the various repos?
2014-11-10T15:50:56 <jhung> yes anastasiac. I started from an empty directory and went from there.
2014-11-10T15:51:17 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a try and let you know how it goes.

2014-11-10T17:04:00 <jhernandez> right now it\'s just a mock-up, but at least it gives some ideas of what can we do with it
2014-11-10T17:04:03 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-10T17:06:24 <kasparnet> hey colinclark\'ster
2014-11-10T17:06:32 <colinclark> hello
2014-11-10T17:06:55 <kasparnet> how are things?
2014-11-10T17:07:03 <colinclark> not bad
2014-11-10T17:07:06 <colinclark> how about with you?
2014-11-10T17:07:49 <kasparnet> pretty good -- my stresslevel have dropped dramatically... not sure whether it\'s good or it\'s because it\'s been replaced with resignation :)
2014-11-10T17:07:55 <colinclark> lol
2014-11-10T17:07:59 <kasparnet> but it\'s less stressful for sure :)
2014-11-10T17:08:13 <kasparnet> plus I\'m in a bar with jhernandez
2014-11-10T17:08:53 <colinclark> that\'ll help lower the stress level, for sure
2014-11-10T17:09:02 <kasparnet> indeed :)
2014-11-10T17:09:25 <kasparnet> colinclark: really exciting to see how much work antranig got done saturday
2014-11-10T17:09:45 <kasparnet> we\'re getting really close to have the fireball branch ready to replace master, I think
2014-11-10T17:10:26 <colinclark> that\'s awesome

2014-11-10T17:30:29 <kasparnet> I\'ve been spending the last 20 minutes trying to get fucking npm install to run in windows
2014-11-10T17:30:32 <kasparnet> and it keeps failing
2014-11-10T17:30:45 <Bosmon> So I\'ve merged jhernandez branch into linux and now the linux integration tests seem to be working fine
2014-11-10T17:30:48 <Bosmon> Sorry
2014-11-10T17:30:52 <Bosmon> Linux acceptance tests
2014-11-10T17:31:00 <Bosmon> Now I\'m just working on the "windows integration tests in linux" issue
2014-11-10T17:31:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon: awesome!
2014-11-10T17:31:59 <kasparnet> jhernandez: is currently looking at android
2014-11-10T17:32:04 <Bosmon> That\'s great
2014-11-10T17:32:37 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-11-10T17:40:09 <jhernandez> btw, who\'s gonna take care of Android\'s pull requests? - It would be great if someone gives a review to https://github.com/GPII/android/pull/23/
2014-11-10T17:40:38 <kasparnet> Bosmon: just an FYI - tried running your windows branch on my 32 bit install - works just fine... Tried running mine and a few of the tests are failing... Might be due to my half-assed "fix" to the integration tests ... will look into it now
2014-11-10T17:48:06 * clown has quit
2014-11-10T17:50:02 <kasparnet> jhernandez: I think sgithens____ is probably still the best for that... I can perhaps get my phone set up while here to test that it\'s working, but steve should probably do a sanity check on it
2014-11-10T17:56:46 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-10T17:56:52 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-11-10T17:58:54 * clown joined the channel

2014-11-10T18:07:54 <jhung> Justin_o: I have used the ghpages plugin in docpad and created a gh-pages branch in my personal repo. I\'m now going to issue a pull request to master. After that not sure what happens. Any idea?
2014-11-10T18:08:18 <Justin_o> jhung: did you push that up to your github repo?
2014-11-10T18:08:27 <jhung> yes Justin_o
2014-11-10T18:08:34 <Justin_o> can you drop a link for us to look at
2014-11-10T18:08:57 <jhung> Justin_o: https://github.com/jhung/fluidproject.org/tree/gh-pages
2014-11-10T18:09:01 <Justin_o> jhung: a couple things will be needed, code review and pushing up to master.. maybe some docs on how to use the plugin and what the workflow is should be added to the repo too..
2014-11-10T18:09:19 <Justin_o> jhung: also we\'ll need to change the DNS and add a CNAME file to the gh-pages branch in the main repo
2014-11-10T18:09:32 <jhung> good idea Justin_o. Also I noticed the plugin removes the readme.md from the output.
2014-11-10T18:09:58 <jhung> avtar was going to look after the DNS and CNAME changes once we have the site running.
2014-11-10T18:10:54 <Justin_o> jhung: i actually meant the link to the hosted site :)
2014-11-10T18:14:08 <jhung> Justin_o: yep. I inferred that. :) I\'ll update the readme to include the deploy workflow. In the deployed site, do you think we should have a readme.md file or is it understood what a gh-pages branch is?
2014-11-10T18:19:23 <Justin_o> jhung: i was thinking that the main branch that holds the source files that docpad uses should have the readme
2014-11-10T18:21:49 <jhung> Yes Justin_o that already has a readme. It just needs updating with the gh-pages deploy info. I will update that now and submit a pull for it.
2014-11-10T18:23:46 * danaayotte has quit
2014-11-10T18:27:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should the queuedDataSource be a relay component
2014-11-10T18:27:28 <Justin_o> now that it doesn\'t actually have  model itself i was going to switch it to an eventedComponent
2014-11-10T18:27:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - certainly, an eventedComponent is fine
2014-11-10T18:29:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, looking over your comments on the pull request now
2014-11-10T18:30:12 <Justin_o> what you say they should be declarative, what did you have in mind
2014-11-10T18:30:18 <Justin_o> currently it is an array of objects
2014-11-10T18:38:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it sort of looks like an array of objects
2014-11-10T18:38:13 <Bosmon> But in a little way, it is actually a fake array of objects : P
2014-11-10T18:38:32 <Bosmon> Since it has things in it which have been fished out of members of a component
2014-11-10T18:38:43 <Bosmon> By "declarative" I mean, "equivalent to a structure written in JSON"
2014-11-10T18:38:58 <Bosmon> And also in general, into the bargain, "Expressed at a well-known location in a public namespace"
2014-11-10T18:39:42 <Bosmon> Our sense of "declarative", in our community, is generally a little stronger than the one this word generally has
2014-11-10T18:40:22 <Bosmon> "Normal people" when they say "declarative" can mean a variety of things... generally implying some kind of sense that "they are no longer encoding explicit logical steps"
2014-11-10T18:40:52 <Bosmon> Whereas our sense is generally stronger than this, in terms of saying that "declarative" implies "completely externalisable"
2014-11-10T18:41:08 <Bosmon> That is, "You could take this structure and store it in a JSON-structured file without losing any of its function or meaning"
2014-11-10T18:46:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm. okay.. i get the namespace part
2014-11-10T18:46:50 <Justin_o> i\'m still not clear on how this should look
2014-11-10T18:47:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well - what would happen if you took one of your "requests" structures and wrote it to disk
2014-11-10T18:47:22 <Bosmon> And then tried to read it back again?
2014-11-10T18:47:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure.. i understand that part
2014-11-10T18:47:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess i\'m not sure i know what to do about it :)
2014-11-10T18:47:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so instead of writing that.get
2014-11-10T18:48:01 <Justin_o> i could just write type: "get"
2014-11-10T18:48:04 <Justin_o> or something like that
2014-11-10T18:48:09 <Justin_o> would that address that part of the issue
2014-11-10T18:48:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the typical answer takes the form, "turn things into strings and then make little machines to interpret them"
2014-11-10T18:48:34 <Bosmon> Which you could say the entire IoC framework is an example of
2014-11-10T18:49:00 <Bosmon> little machines or big
2014-11-10T18:49:22 <Justin_o> right so just writing type: "get" and having the component figure out which method would be sufficient
2014-11-10T18:49:35 <Bosmon> For this will be a jolly Court, for little and for big!
2014-11-10T18:49:43 <Bosmon> Sing hey, the jolly jinks of Pfennig Halbpfennig!
2014-11-10T18:49:49 <Justin_o> where is that from
2014-11-10T18:49:50 <Justin_o> ?
2014-11-10T18:49:51 <Bosmon> From morn to night our lives shall be as merry as a grig!
2014-11-10T18:50:00 <Bosmon> Sing hey, the jolly jinks of Pfennig Halbpfennig!
2014-11-10T18:50:28 <Bosmon> http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/grand_duke/html/
2014-11-10T18:50:34 <Bosmon> Sorry for the musical interlude : P
2014-11-10T18:50:55 <Bosmon> Apparently the exact sense of "merry as a grig" has never been decrypted by later commentators
2014-11-10T18:51:06 <Justin_o> for point 2 I\'ll have to think some more about what is interesting.. i was afraid of making things overly complex to the point where the tests were unreadable and unintelligible for anyone trying to update them or trying to find out why something may or may not be passing
2014-11-10T18:51:09 <Bosmon> Although there is a theory that this might actually imply "as merry as a GREEK"
2014-11-10T18:51:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: when was this written.. maybe the author is still around to ask :)
2014-11-10T18:51:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, there\'s readability on one hand.... and then there\'s making the tests actually test the implementation as another : P
2014-11-10T18:51:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think we need both
2014-11-10T18:51:58 <Bosmon> I\'m sure you can find a way of achieving the latter without compromising the former too much
2014-11-10T18:52:18 <Bosmon> Unfortunately he died over a century ago
2014-11-10T18:52:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s too bad... it will be hard to form proofs then
2014-11-10T18:52:47 <Bosmon> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grig
2014-11-10T18:53:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. next question
2014-11-10T18:53:30 <Justin_o> "As discussed in the channel, the "get" tests should verify "point of delivery of request" by returning values from a model which is considered "continuously incrementing" (and it is these these returned values which are put into the "record" and so tested)"
2014-11-10T18:53:45 <Justin_o> when you say that.. i don\'t quite understand how that will show which get request returned what
2014-11-10T18:53:53 <Justin_o> i\'m probably missing something here
2014-11-10T18:54:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, you\'ll simply construct an array consisting of the return values of each get request that you issue

2014-11-10T14:54:15 <kasparnet> Hello Dr. Dr. Bosmon Bosmodium Explodium
2014-11-10T14:55:22 <kasparnet> it was awesome to see all the pull request get merged into the fireball branch ovr the weekend
2014-11-10T14:55:48 <Bosmon> hey there KASPARDNETT!
2014-11-10T14:55:58 <Bosmon> I\'m just working in VERNANDDEZ recent pul now
2014-11-10T14:55:58 <kasparnet> hey man
2014-11-10T14:56:09 <kasparnet> oh cool
2014-11-10T14:56:10 <Bosmon> And then I will fix the path issue that stops our Integration tests running on Linux
2014-11-10T14:56:16 <Bosmon> How is your branch doing?
2014-11-10T14:56:21 <kasparnet> ok - I was actually jsut looking at that
2014-11-10T14:56:34 <kasparnet> I\'m fully merged with your stuff and everything is passing except for the integration tests
2014-11-10T14:56:52 <kasparnet> and I was just working on the path thing on the way down here
2014-11-10T14:56:57 <kasparnet> (madrid)
2014-11-10T14:57:00 <Bosmon> oh ok
2014-11-10T14:57:02 <Bosmon> Are you there already?
2014-11-10T14:57:27 <kasparnet> yeah - flights tomorrow wouldn\'t get me here in time for the meeting, so I had to arrive today
2014-11-10T14:57:45 <kasparnet> but javi will get to the hotel in about 15 mins or so
2014-11-10T14:57:51 <Bosmon> oh cool
2014-11-10T14:57:55 <kasparnet> which is nice
2014-11-10T14:58:11 <Bosmon> I wonder if you can duplicate the XRANDR test failure I saw
2014-11-10T14:58:12 <kasparnet> yeah - need some food - but after that I think the plan is to get some hacking done
2014-11-10T14:58:14 <Bosmon> This blows up in my VM
2014-11-10T14:58:28 <kasparnet> sure, I can try
2014-11-10T14:59:45 <kasparnet> Bosmon: should  I just pull down your universal and the linux branch?
2014-11-10T14:59:50 <kasparnet> master*
2014-11-10T15:00:09 <kasparnet> ok.. lemme try that again: should I just pull down your GPII-434 universal and the linux master?
2014-11-10T15:00:11 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes - there should only be pretty minor changes now
2014-11-10T15:00:17 <Bosmon> let me just put VANTTUNEZ thing into mine
2014-11-10T15:00:23 <kasparnet> Bosmon:
2014-11-10T15:00:24 <kasparnet> ok
2014-11-10T15:00:41 <kasparnet> should I drop looking at the path thing in universal btw?
2014-11-10T15:00:59 <Bosmon> Well, not if you\'ve done anything about it : P
2014-11-10T15:01:03 <Bosmon> I was just about to start
2014-11-10T15:01:05 <kasparnet> not too far from getting it to work - but can\'t think of any pretty fixes
2014-11-10T15:01:11 <Bosmon> !
2014-11-10T15:01:13 <Bosmon> What have you done
2014-11-10T15:01:15 <kasparnet> hehe or well
2014-11-10T15:01:23 <kasparnet> I can think of pretty fixes for most of it
2014-11-10T15:01:40 <kasparnet> but I\'m stuck on fucking mac and windows liking different path-delimiters
2014-11-10T15:01:53 <Bosmon> They actually don\'t care
2014-11-10T15:02:03 <Bosmon> And it isn\'t relevant anyway, since it\'s just an integration testing issue
2014-11-10T15:02:09 <Bosmon> Can you send me the diff of what you have done?
2014-11-10T15:02:17 <kasparnet> sure, give me a sec
2014-11-10T15:02:25 <Bosmon> All we really require is that the base path be "any string" in order to get the integration tests to work
2014-11-10T15:03:07 <cindyli> danaayotte, Justin_o, when you have time, can i show you how infusion demos with removed the overview panel look like on mobile devices so we can decide if we should go ahead with this approach?
2014-11-10T15:03:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure i\'m ready whenever
2014-11-10T15:08:45 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok - uploaded my stuff to GPII-941 branch  now
2014-11-10T15:09:11 <kasparnet> not sure if it\'s particularly correct or useful - so feel free to throw it out :)
2014-11-10T15:11:17 <Bosmon> kasparnet - how can I "throw it out" : P
2014-11-10T15:11:23 <Bosmon> I need to merge up with your branch....
2014-11-10T15:13:29 <kasparnet> oh - yeah - I realized that after committing -- I should probably have pushed to a different branch :)
2014-11-10T15:14:04 <Bosmon> We can do this a lot more simply with the existing "nameResolver"
2014-11-10T15:14:21 <Bosmon> Well
2014-11-10T15:14:24 <Bosmon> Not A LOT more simply...
2014-11-10T15:16:42 <Bosmon> Why do you call it "failed attempt"?
2014-11-10T15:17:02 <kasparnet> well - the the thing I ended up with just before pinging you
2014-11-10T15:17:13 <kasparnet> was that the two paths resolved differently
2014-11-10T15:17:20 <Bosmon> Which two?
2014-11-10T15:17:37 <kasparnet> the solution regiwtry on:                     "filename": "${{environment}.APPDATA}\\\
vda\\\
vda.ini",
2014-11-10T15:17:44 <kasparnet> would resolve to:
2014-11-10T15:18:11 <kasparnet> url/to/my/home/dir/nvda\
vda.ini
2014-11-10T15:18:32 <kasparnet> and the one from the test definition would resolve to:
2014-11-10T15:19:06 <kasparnet> /url/to/my/home/dir\
vda\
vda.ini
2014-11-10T15:19:26 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2014-11-10T15:19:30 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t really matter
2014-11-10T15:21:05 * anastasiac has quit
2014-11-10T15:21:59 <danaayotte> cindyli justin_o NOW?
2014-11-10T15:22:16 <cindyli> danaayotte: anytime when you are ready
2014-11-10T15:23:52 <kasparnet> Bosmon: it screws up the test though - as in the settingsstore, it\'ll look for two different keys
2014-11-10T15:24:06 <kasparnet> is the linux stuff ready for me to try out, btw?
2014-11-10T15:24:42 <Bosmon> kasparnet not yet, sorry - just give me a sec
2014-11-10T15:24:51 <kasparnet> no worries at all
2014-11-10T15:24:52 <Bosmon> kasparnet - what do you mean, that it will look for two different keys?
2014-11-10T15:26:37 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-11-10T15:27:45 <kasparnet> for the INI handler, the filename is used as key into the settingsStore (line 225 and 256 in Integration.js)
2014-11-10T15:28:06 <kasparnet> and when the user logs in, the solutionsRegistry entry is used
2014-11-10T15:28:21 <kasparnet> and hence settings are stored under
2014-11-10T15:28:22 <kasparnet> :url/to/my/home/dir/nvda\
vda.ini
2014-11-10T15:28:25 * clown joined the channel
2014-11-10T15:29:32 <Bosmon> I\'m completely puzzled
2014-11-10T15:29:46 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-11-10T15:30:43 <Bosmon> What\'s NVDA got to do with this ......
2014-11-10T15:30:48 <Bosmon> On
2014-11-10T15:30:49 <Bosmon> oh
2014-11-10T15:30:50 <Bosmon> Sorry
2014-11-10T15:30:53 <Bosmon> I am very confused
2014-11-10T15:30:55 <Bosmon> Just a second
2014-11-10T15:31:00 <jhernandez> Bosmon: you\'re always confused!
2014-11-10T15:31:04 <jhernandez> :P
