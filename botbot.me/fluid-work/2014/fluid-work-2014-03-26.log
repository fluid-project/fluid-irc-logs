2014-03-26T14:00:45 <Justin_o> cindyli: good morning.. I\'ve made a change to the resourceInputPanel tests in my FLOE-171 branch.. you can merge that into your branch. Unfortunately there is one set of tests that fails, but I think this is related to changes with the indicator
2014-03-26T14:01:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: so it will probably need to be fixed when you finish the other changes
2014-03-26T14:01:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: also, chris made a change to the GPII-667 pull request, could you take another look at that?
2014-03-26T14:04:20 <cindyli> got it, thanks, Justin_o

2014-03-26T16:46:03 <clown> thanks.
2014-03-26T16:46:41 <clown> kasparnet:  part 2:  you (europe) changes to summer time by next week?
2014-03-26T16:47:10 <kasparnet> yes, sunday night, I believe
2014-03-26T16:47:37 <clown> okay.  that will help me remember the correct time.
2014-03-26T16:48:49 <jhernandez> kasparnet: yes, we switch to summer time on sunday
2014-03-26T16:48:54 <kasparnet> cool

2014-03-26T17:40:51 <karan10> justin_o: hi
2014-03-26T17:49:59 <Justin_o> karan10: hello
2014-03-26T17:51:01 <karan10> justin_o: on Picture Dictionary proposal I received comment that A better approach would be to use a RESTful API that supports JSON  to get the images.
2014-03-26T17:52:38 <karan10> INow I understood the working and how we can get images using google custom search API . I got the result in JSON format also.
2014-03-26T17:54:02 <karan10> but is there any important use of JSON. We can only use the code generated by the api in our project.
2014-03-26T17:57:59 * jessm joined the channel
2014-03-26T18:02:10 <Justin_o> karan10: i\'m not sure what you mean
2014-03-26T18:03:42 <Justin_o> karan10: are you asking if we would need the JSON data for something else?
2014-03-26T18:03:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are you there?
2014-03-26T18:04:53 <karan10> justin_o: I mean comment on my proposal(Picture Dictionary) says A better approach would be to use a RESTful API that supports JSON to get the images.  why JSON is needed for it.
2014-03-26T18:06:04 <Justin_o> karan10: okay... here\'s a description of json http://www.json.org
2014-03-26T18:06:43 <Justin_o> it\'s a data-interchange format it will be much easier and clearer to get the data out of this rather than doing any DOM scraping
2014-03-26T18:09:16 * cindyli has quit
2014-03-26T18:11:56 <karan10> Justin_o: Ok, I made a search of creative content imaes using API. It resulted Json format description of Images. Now we can easily get the required data from this.
2014-03-26T18:12:19 <karan10> Is this approach is acceptable?
2014-03-26T18:12:56 <Justin_o> karan10: i believe so, can you send me the link to the API
2014-03-26T18:16:03 <karan10> here "https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#s/customsearch/v1/search.cse.list?q=apple&cx=011866168012208800368%253A7jsrz6ewg6u&rights=cc_noncommercial&searchType=image&_h=1&"
2014-03-26T18:20:16 <vjoanna> hi karan, have you considered other sources for images: http://search.creativecommons.org
2014-03-26T18:20:29 <Justin_o> karan10: okay, and you\'ll probably want to use the REST api for it https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/using_rest

2014-03-26T18:30:19 <Justin_o> karan10: i believe the link vjoanna dropped is a list of some other resources that provide creative commons content

2014-03-26T18:31:27 <Justin_o> karan10: you may wish to provide more than one as an option and you may find that one of those is better suited than google\'s
2014-03-26T18:34:23 <karan10> Justin_o: sure! thanks for help.
