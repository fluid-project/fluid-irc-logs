2014-02-24T19:35:30 <Justin_o> kasparne_: can't remember if i asked you this before, but what is the browser support for PMT/PCP?
2014-02-24T19:36:00 <kasparne_> as in requirements, or what we currently support?
2014-02-24T19:37:14 <michelled> kasparne_: avtar has just deployed the prefs server!
2014-02-24T19:37:42 <Justin_o> kasparne_: as it what we should be supporting.. i think i've only been testing with FF
2014-02-24T19:37:55 <michelled> kasparne_: do you happen to know off hand which config we need to switch for PCP/PMT?
2014-02-24T19:38:01 <kasparne_> michelled: I just tried it... seems to be working
2014-02-24T19:38:09 <michelled> yay :)
2014-02-24T19:39:07 <kasparne_> Justin_o: well - I figured for the pilots, that we can just require them to use a specific browser
2014-02-24T19:39:18 <kasparne_> though in the long run we need to support a wider range
2014-02-24T19:39:54 <kasparne_> Justin_o: now that I'm writing this, though.. was there something about either firefox or chrome not working well with NVDA?
2014-02-24T19:39:56 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay, makes sense
2014-02-24T19:40:12 <kasparne_> michelled: for it to use the preferences server?
2014-02-24T19:40:25 <Justin_o> kasparne_: cindyli's been doing the work for GPII-600 so she might have a better perspective on that
2014-02-24T19:41:25 <michelled> kasparne_: yeah
2014-02-24T19:42:33 <cindyli> kasparne_: some aria attributes are not announced by NVDA in firefox, such as the current value of a spin button
2014-02-24T19:43:28 <cindyli> kasparne_: also noticed some focusing issue that doesn't happen with firefox but does in chrome

2014-02-24T19:46:18 <kasparne_> michelled: hmm... it looks like there isn't really an appropriate config atm (I forgot what we did in pilot #1)
2014-02-24T19:47:12 <kasparne_> ... or actually, this one might do the job: fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.production.json
2014-02-24T19:47:22 <kasparne_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.production.json
2014-02-24T19:48:06 <kasparne_> though for now, it's probably a good idea to turn logging on: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.production.json#L9
2014-02-24T19:48:38 <Justin_o> kasparne_: this is where jhernandez changed this for the review https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/19ba38e7bab086769f6f4831c9923a6f87fc1b60
2014-02-24T19:50:15 <kasparne_> Justin_o: cheers, that should work as well!
2014-02-24T19:50:32 <kasparne_> cindyli: ok, thanks! Well - perhaps we should decide on one (the one that works best) and only worry about the issues in that for now
2014-02-24T19:52:18 <kasparne_> Justin_o, michelled, cindyli: going afk for 20 mins, will be back
2014-02-24T19:53:17 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay
2014-02-24T20:20:10 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please code review this gpii pull request for me https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/37
2014-02-24T20:20:24 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2014-02-24T20:21:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2014-02-24T20:29:44 <cindyli> do you want me to send an email to kasper to merge it, Justin_o?
2014-02-24T20:30:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes please, i think pinging him on the pull request should be enough
2014-02-24T20:30:56 <cindyli> will do that, thanks, Justin_o
2014-02-24T20:31:32 <Justin_o> thank cindyli

2014-02-24T20:48:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: saw your comments on the GPII-590 pull request about unit tests.. they are badly needed, but unfortunately there is no time at the moment to do them. I believe it was agreed that they would create them after the pilot push has completed. It is really unfortunate that we don't have them already.
