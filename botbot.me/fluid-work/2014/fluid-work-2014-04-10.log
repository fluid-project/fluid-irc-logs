b'2014-04-10T20:09:19 <jhung> cindyli: I pushed up changes to my repo. The active tab styling should work now.
2014-04-10T20:09:55 <cindyli> great. thanks, jhung
2014-04-10T20:10:47 <jhung> cindyli: I guess the next thing to do is for me to create the prepopulated content. Do you know where this is going?
2014-04-10T20:11:21 <cindyli> it goes into demos/js/predefinedOER.js
2014-04-10T20:11:41 <cindyli> the "content" element, jhung
2014-04-10T20:12:18 <jhung> thanks cindyli

2014-04-10T20:25:53 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I\'m testing out your branch now
2014-04-10T20:26:08 <Bosmon> I am finding that the current configuration of jshint doesn\'t appear to be checking whitespace
2014-04-10T20:26:13 <Bosmon> Did it used to?
2014-04-10T20:26:37 <Justin_o> I believe it did.
2014-04-10T20:26:51 <Bosmon> I added some random whitespace to FLuid.js and it didn\'t seem to complain
2014-04-10T20:26:57 <Bosmon> Either on trailing whitespace or indentation
2014-04-10T20:27:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m just heading out now. Can you leave me a comment about it and I\'ll look into it tomorrow. But I was getting errors before.
2014-04-10T20:27:25 <Bosmon> Ok, sure Justin_o
2014-04-10T20:27:27 <Bosmon> Thanks
2014-04-10T20:27:48 <Justin_o> I was using an older version of jshint when I started so could be related to that. I\'ll look into it though. Thanks for catching that.

b'2014-04-10T16:59:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was wondering about that.. they are close in that one is at the beginning of the function and the other is at the end.
2014-04-10T16:59:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would it be clearer if it was on the line directly above
2014-04-10T17:00:04 <Justin_o> i\'m just not sure that the comment makes as much sense then
2014-04-10T17:00:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if you could just add the word "jshint" somewhere in the opening comment I think that would be clear enough
2014-04-10T17:00:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I can try again, but from previous testing using jshint in a comment made it think i was passing configuration to it
2014-04-10T17:01:01 <Bosmon> Or else you could move the comment to the line following the directive, after the loop
2014-04-10T17:01:40 <Bosmon> You could try subtly misspelling it such as "jsl1int" :)
2014-04-10T17:01:47 <Justin_o> haha
2014-04-10T17:02:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how about a note beside the jshint comment to refer to the comment at the top of the function?
2014-04-10T17:03:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, perhaps just /* function in loop */ would be sufficient
2014-04-10T17:04:03 <michelled> Justin_o, cindyli, jhung, anastasiac, simonjb, Bosmon: I\'m not working tomorrow and just wanted to do a quick Floe check in given that we have such a tight timeline
2014-04-10T17:04:21 <michelled> Justin_o, cindyli, jhung: how is the metadata demo coming?
2014-04-10T17:04:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool... i\'ll make that change
2014-04-10T17:05:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - is your branch up to date with master?
2014-04-10T17:06:26 <jhung> michelled: styling is coming along. I don\'t think I\'ll finish the styling this week (I\'m hoping Monday it will be done), but the integration of the overviewPanel should be able to proceed even if I\'m not done this yet.
2014-04-10T17:07:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - how is FLUID-5293 looking now?
2014-04-10T17:07:39 <cindyli> michelled: the editor and metadata panels have been integrated into jhung\'s new design and working well. next steps are, 1. using infusion tab component for new demo tabs, 2. recover preview and markup viewer into the new demo
2014-04-10T17:08:23 <cindyli> Bosmon: oh, you have a new fix for it. haven\'t tried yet. will let you know once I try it
2014-04-10T17:08:44 <michelled> thanks jhung and cindyli. cindyli does it look like it will get done this week?
2014-04-10T17:09:06 <cindyli> michelled: yes, should be able to
2014-04-10T17:09:14 <michelled> cool
2014-04-10T17:09:27 <michelled> anastasiac: how\'s the screen cast coming?
2014-04-10T17:11:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: made that change and pushed up, also the pull requests are up-to-date with master
2014-04-10T17:11:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - fantastic
2014-04-10T17:11:44 <Bosmon> I look forward to merging shortly :)
2014-04-10T17:12:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) exciting
2014-04-10T17:12:28 <michelled> speaking of merging - Bosmon, simonjb: how\'s this pull coming? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/487
2014-04-10T17:12:37 <Bosmon> michelled - I believe that one is ready
2014-04-10T17:12:43 <Bosmon> I\'ll take a final look shortly
2014-04-10T17:12:46 <michelled> thanks!
2014-04-10T17:13:06 <Bosmon> I had some final "concerns" yesterday about our styles for "hiding"
2014-04-10T17:13:18 <Bosmon> Which weren\'t really an issue for this pull in particular, but for the community in general
2014-04-10T17:13:45 <simonjb> michelled, Bosmon: I\'ve not yet moved the attribute test assertyions to declarative form
2014-04-10T17:14:01 <simonjb> but, I think that is all that is left
2014-04-10T17:14:07 <michelled> cool
2014-04-10T17:14:13 <simonjb> other than the "hiding" discussion
2014-04-10T17:14:25 <simonjb> which I would prefer to leave as is for now
2014-04-10T17:14:41 <Bosmon> Yes, I don\'t think the "hiding" discussion needs to hold up this work
2014-04-10T17:14:51 <michelled> that seems reasonable if it\'s a community wide issue. perhaps we can talk about the hiding issue on list?
2014-04-10T17:15:18 <Bosmon> It\'s just one of the many things we\'ll need to talk about as part of the process of ditching FSS in favour of something else
2014-04-10T17:15:22 <michelled> or here of course. :) I\'m curious about it, but I don\'t want to delay the current work
2014-04-10T17:15:36 <Bosmon> Since I believe that FSS provided a "ready-baked" style for this that was just our standard recommendation
2014-04-10T17:16:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think a lot of those hiding parts came from HTML5 boilerplate, so we might just need to pull this in
2014-04-10T17:16:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that sounds sensible
2014-04-10T17:17:09 <Bosmon> I\'m keen that this is an issue that every component doesn\'t need to think out for itself
2014-04-10T17:17:12 <michelled> so, cindyli, I think you have the most risky work on your plate (risky in that there still a fair amount to get done in the next day) is there anything we can do to reduce that risk?
2014-04-10T17:17:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: makes sense
2014-04-10T17:20:14 <cindyli> not sure what we could do, but first i\'d like to check with Justin_o on the necessity of using Tabs.js.
2014-04-10T17:20:17 <cindyli> Justin_o, i was looking at Tabs.js but don\'t see where it makes tabs more accessible
2014-04-10T17:20:58 <Justin_o> cindyli: it\'s basically just a component wrapper around jQuery\'s tabs widget.. which should have already incorporated aria
2014-04-10T17:21:37 <cindyli> Justin_o: it seems just a wrapper without aria incorporated
2014-04-10T17:22:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: the aria should have been coming from jQuery not from the wrapper. Is there no aria at all?
2014-04-10T17:23:47 <cindyli> ha, thanks, Justin_o, didn\'t realize the aira attributes could be coming from jQuery
2014-04-10T17:23:52 <cindyli> let me try
2014-04-10T17:24:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. hope it works :)
2014-04-10T17:28:54 <cindyli> Bosmon: i created a jira for the use case i mentioned yesterday with "fluid.tranforms.condition" - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5307, can you take a look to see if it makes sense?

2014-04-10T18:10:48 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - it\'s an interesting report
2014-04-10T18:10:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: is the aria bing applied to the tabs?
2014-04-10T18:11:25 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o
2014-04-10T18:11:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - can you explain what function the inversion is meant to perform? That is, what sequence of UI actions should lead to the inversion being required
2014-04-10T18:16:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: the three states of audio appears to be three radio buttons on the page. the selection on any of these radio buttons need to be inverted so it\'s reflected on the source model. in the case 4 described in the jira, the "unknown" radio button is selected initially. If users don\'t make any change to radio buttons, this "unknown" should be inverted to whatever it was sourced from. If users make change to another state and re-select "unkno
2014-04-10T18:23:05 <cindyli> jhung, you may wanna chime in if what i described to Bosmon is not the desired behavior. we are talking about the transformation between the audio metadata and what\'s needed for the audio panel

2014-04-10T18:24:12 <Bosmon> Could you add it as a JIRA comment?
2014-04-10T18:24:17 <cindyli> sure
2014-04-10T18:25:31 <cindyli> Added as a jira comment, Bosmon
2014-04-10T18:26:17 <jhung> cindyli: Didn\'t you have a note that describes the behaviour? I think that summarizes the behaviour.
2014-04-10T18:26:51 <cindyli> yes, jhung, the jira was based on that note :)
2014-04-10T18:27:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think I understand your use case, and it is quite an advanced one.... something that the current transformation can\'t accommodate
2014-04-10T18:27:24 <cindyli> ok, Bosmon
2014-04-10T18:27:42 <Bosmon> Whilst I am thinking about it, it may be best for you to implement this using a "custom relay" - that is, just to write a custom transform which is not invertible
2014-04-10T18:27:43 <cindyli> probably we should create a fourth state
2014-04-10T18:27:52 <Bosmon> And to implement the inverse mapping as a manual changelistener in the other direction
2014-04-10T18:28:02 <cindyli> ah. i see
2014-04-10T18:28:58 <Bosmon> The forward direction is unproblematic although even that would be awkward expressed in terms of our current transforms
2014-04-10T18:29:12 <Bosmon> But the "partial inverse" direction is something that our current MT can\'t accommoddate
2014-04-10T18:29:31 <Bosmon> Very strange that we run into this difficult task as our very first excursion for model relay : P
2014-04-10T18:29:38 <Bosmon> But I guess that is what happens......
2014-04-10T18:30:22 <cindyli> better to happen earlier than later ;)
2014-04-10T18:30:45 <Bosmon> Well, I was expecting we could run for a couple of years without running into this kind of case :)
2014-04-10T18:30:56 <cindyli> we are lucky ;)
2014-04-10T18:31:04 <Bosmon> I was just privately reflecting to colinclark how peculiar the distribution of problems that you run into in the real world is
2014-04-10T18:31:13 <Bosmon> And how strongly it differs from your expectations
2014-04-10T18:31:30 <Bosmon> Any "normal nerd" would have expected our performance problems with the current framework would be our biggest current problem
2014-04-10T18:31:33 <Bosmon> But really they aren\'t
2014-04-10T18:31:54 <Bosmon> Whereas we run into this peculiar case of "pseudoinverse mapping" as almost our first task for the model relay system : P
2014-04-10T18:32:37 <Bosmon> I will now use my upcoming SHOWER TIME to think how to deal with this problem properly....
2014-04-10T18:33:03 <Bosmon> But for the time being you are ok to use a custom ChangeListener to implement your "pseudoinverse" - that is, a changeListener that "reads ahead" to look into the target model to see whether it should change it or not
2014-04-10T18:33:45 <cindyli> ok. will try that. thanks, Bosmon
2014-04-10T18:34:30 <cindyli> have a safe shower, don\'t think too much

2014-04-10T14:57:22 <cindyli> jhung: the new resource editor is now working properly with metadata components. I noticed the styling for video metadata panels are all broken since all the css classnames have been changed. Do you want me to place the old styling back with new classnames or you will work out something else?
2014-04-10T14:59:22 <jhung> cindyli: I can take a look and see how best to approach this.
2014-04-10T15:00:15 <cindyli> cool, jhung. i\'ve pushed the latest change to https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/tree/FLOE-178
2014-04-10T15:01:32 <jhung> thanks cindyli I\'ll pull that down
2014-04-10T15:01:45 <cindyli> np and thanks
2014-04-10T15:06:00 <jhung> cindyli: this is looking good! I think we\'re going to have to fix the styling of the component. It really shouldn\'t have broke (i.e. the default styling should work regardless of the integration).
2014-04-10T15:08:04 <cindyli> jhung: one thing is style.css we used previously is not included in the resource.html. the other is that all the previous classes are named with "fl-" prefix, but now changed to "gpii-" prefix
2014-04-10T15:09:47 <jhung> cindyli: I see now. Yes we should update those classnames in src/css/style.css
2014-04-10T15:10:05 <cindyli> ok. let me know if you want me to do it
2014-04-10T15:10:17 <jhung> cindyli: could you please?
2014-04-10T15:10:24 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2014-04-10T15:10:30 <jhung> great thanks cindyli!

2014-04-10T15:26:06 <jhung> Justin_o: for the demo, do you think we should use SVGs for the icons, or stay with icon fonts as we have done it in the past?
2014-04-10T15:26:56 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-04-10T15:27:03 <Justin_o> jhung: for consistency i\'d stick with icon fonts, unless you want to have it be multiple colours
2014-04-10T15:27:41 <jhung> Justin_o: no need for multiple colours currently. I\'m fine with sticking w icon fonts.
2014-04-10T15:27:53 <Justin_o> jhung: cool, thanks

2014-04-10T15:38:22 <jhung> cindyli: before you start on the preview and outputHTML tabs, we\'ll need to integrate Tabs.js into our demo. For an example implementation, the Linearization demo uses it.
2014-04-10T15:38:43 <cindyli> ah. ok, jhung
2014-04-10T15:39:14 <cindyli> will get to that first
2014-04-10T15:39:19 <jhung> The styling will likely break, so once you have that integrated, can you push so I can fix it cindyli?
2014-04-10T15:39:30 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2014-04-10T15:39:54 <jhung> Do you need anything else from me cindyli?
2014-04-10T15:40:45 <cindyli> not for now, jhung, btw, do you know the equivalent of bootstrap "list-unstyled" in foundation?

2014-04-10T15:44:36 * kasper__ joined the channel
2014-04-10T15:45:14 <jhung> cindyli: there isn\'t any. We would just use list-style-type: none property to remove any bullets.
2014-04-10T15:45:32 <cindyli> ok, thanks, jhung
2014-04-10T15:45:36 <jhung> is this for the metadata component cindyli?
2014-04-10T15:45:54 <cindyli> yes, jhung
2014-04-10T15:46:36 <jhung> the metadata component shouldn\'t be using a framework - we should be using plain old CSS as our default.
2014-04-10T15:47:05 <jhung> cindyli: in this case, should I handle the restyling of the metadata panel?
2014-04-10T15:47:24 <jhung> I didn\'t realize we used bootstrap for its styling.
2014-04-10T15:47:55 <cindyli> that would be great, jhung. pushing up what i\'ve got so far
2014-04-10T15:48:25 <jhung> ok. I\'ll look at that now cindyli
2014-04-10T15:48:48 <cindyli> thanks but one sec, still pushing, jhung

2014-04-10T16:33:12 <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhung

2014-04-10T16:39:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ve fixed up another "use strict"; related issue in there too
2014-04-10T16:39:33 <cindyli> jhung: did you try to fix the styling of the metadata panels? they still look broken
2014-04-10T16:40:06 <jhung> I haven\'t done anything there yet because I needed to namespace the demo styles properly first cindyli.
2014-04-10T16:41:28 <cindyli> ok, jhung, i fixed the renaming in js files accordingly. the metadata panels are back. the changes have been pushed up
2014-04-10T16:41:46 <jhung> thanks cindyli.

2014-04-10T16:58:26 <Bosmon> Do you think you could just tweak the 3 "function in loop" comments to make it clear that they are related to the jshint directive?
2014-04-10T16:58:40 <Bosmon> Since in all these cases there are several lines between the annotation comment and the directive comment
