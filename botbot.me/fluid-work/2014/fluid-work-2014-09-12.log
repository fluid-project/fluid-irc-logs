2014-09-12T13:58:35 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o
2014-09-12T13:58:48 <Bosmon7> I'm in meetings today but perhaps I can give some quick answers to some questions
2014-09-12T14:00:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: cool thanks.. i've been trying to test the request summary dialog for the feedback tool. it has a lot of interaction with the other dialogs. since changes to them affect the number of requests.
2014-09-12T14:02:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: to minimize this with conflicting with other tests i have one test tree that doesn't include the request dialog for testing the match and mismatch dialogs, and another that includes it and will eventually test the interactions of all three... however when i include both trees in the IoC Testing framework the second one fails do to an event being
2014-09-12T14:02:33 <Justin_o> bound to a destroyed component or something of that nature
2014-09-12T14:03:45 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - have you tried testing it with my https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/559 branch?
2014-09-12T14:03:54 <Bosmon7> This fixes a very serious error with the IoC Testing framework
2014-09-12T14:04:01 <Justin_o> ah no i haven't
2014-09-12T14:04:06 <Bosmon7> colinclark will review it when we get a moment
2014-09-12T14:04:43 <Bosmon7> If you can update your branch to the Infusion in this pull request, and the problem is still there, I can take a look at it
2014-09-12T14:05:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. i'll try to get the tests i'm currently working on passing then i'll commit it and try this out.
