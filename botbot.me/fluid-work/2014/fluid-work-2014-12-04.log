2014-12-04T14:07:16 <Bosmon> The first looks good
2014-12-04T14:07:35 <simonjb> Bosmon: great, I\'ll go ahead and make that change

2014-12-04T18:25:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon, kasparnet: can you point me at the integration tests for GPII. I\'m hoping to be able to write tests to ensure the communication between the security ui and server is correct.
2014-12-04T18:48:45 <kasparnet> Justin_o: they\'re mostly located in here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/tests
2014-12-04T18:50:13 * yzen joined the channel
2014-12-04T18:53:13 <Justin_o> kasparnet: thanks, do you know if i\'ll be able to write a test that includes browser and server communication
2014-12-04T18:54:16 <kasparnet> Justin_o: the server communication part I know is possible - the browser part I\'m not quite sure of .. could you provide a few more details?
2014-12-04T18:56:21 <Justin_o> lets take security for instance... i want to ensure the contract between what i send on the authorization page to what the server is expecting... so i want to have a test where a request is actually made to the server and a real response is verified.
2014-12-04T18:57:18 <Justin_o> something similar will also be needed for pmt and pcp for example to test that the communication between client and server is correct
2014-12-04T19:03:35 <Justin_o> kasparnet: ^

2014-12-04T19:25:31 <kasparnet> Justin_o: oops, sorry - sitting in windows VM so not getting the regular notifications on pings
2014-12-04T19:25:46 <Justin_o> no problem
2014-12-04T19:26:31 <kasparnet> hmm.. I\'m not sure how to go about this.. I mean, it\'s definitely possible to run the server, send it a request and check some response
2014-12-04T19:27:00 <kasparnet> but the authorization page/PMT part of it, I\'m not sure how to add to a test like that
2014-12-04T19:27:47 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i guess we just think of the authorization server for now
2014-12-04T19:27:52 <Justin_o> and it\'s client
2014-12-04T19:28:00 * danaayotte has quit
2014-12-04T19:29:31 <Justin_o> kasparnet: here we need the server running anyways for even the client tests to work, since js dependencies are also being served. but it would be great if there was an automated way to do all of this
2014-12-04T19:30:26 <simonjb> hi there Bosmon, I\'ve converted the datastore tests to run in-browser and I think I\'ve got pretty good coverage; I was wondering if you might be available for a chat to talk through next steps?
2014-12-04T19:30:26 <Justin_o> the PMT case will be harder since it will require an instance of GPII running and the PMT served
2014-12-04T19:37:44 * yzen joined the channel
2014-12-04T19:48:41 <kasparnet> Justin_o: I guess I didn\'t really do a particularly good job pointing you in the right direction -  https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src holds the actual code (as opposed to the test defs)
2014-12-04T19:49:02 <kasparnet> just looking for the location of the server start stuff
2014-12-04T19:50:19 <kasparnet> Justin_o: probably this file is the simplest example https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/CloudBased.js
2014-12-04T19:51:55 <kasparnet> not sure how one would start multiple servers though

2014-12-04T20:02:29 <Bosmon> kasparnet, Justin_o - my recent DataSource tests in kettle demonstrate how to coordinate tests across multiple servers
2014-12-04T20:02:30 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/test/CrossServerRequestTests.js
2014-12-04T20:03:00 <Bosmon> There isn\'t a particularly automated way of doing it given our existing "canned" fixture generators assume a single server - but it isn\'t that awkward to do
2014-12-04T20:03:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure, voice chat?
2014-12-04T20:03:48 <simonjb> Bosmon: yeah, that would be best I think
2014-12-04T20:04:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: my room on Vidyo?
2014-12-04T20:04:34 <Bosmon> sure

2014-12-04T20:11:05 <Justin_o> simonjb: maybe we could pair up on integration tests from client and server at some point
2014-12-04T20:11:24 <simonjb> Justin_o: for sure
