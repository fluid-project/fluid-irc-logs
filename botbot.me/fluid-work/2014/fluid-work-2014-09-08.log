2014-09-08T12:04:46 * slim has quit
2014-09-08T12:07:29 <amilchev> jhernandez kind of follow-up on your comment here https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/270/
2014-09-08T12:08:01 <amilchev> I was wondering if the default gtk theme for different distributions varies
2014-09-08T12:09:27 <amilchev> and the gtk theme for high contrast does NOT vary, but I suppose is "HighContrast" on different distributions, since we have this value fixed here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/linux.json#L188
2014-09-08T12:09:44 * slim joined the channel
2014-09-08T12:10:06 <amilchev> what\'s the situation with "Low" and "High/Inverse"?
2014-09-08T12:11:21 <amilchev> I tried changing to Low and High/Inverse themes from Universal Access on my Ubuntu
2014-09-08T12:11:44 <amilchev> gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme / icon-theme  both return "LowContrast"
2014-09-08T12:12:13 <amilchev> and "HighContrastInverse"
2014-09-08T12:13:07 <amilchev> I also have a virtual Fedora 17 - I\'m about to check if the values are the same there
2014-09-08T12:14:02 <amilchev> my idea is to make PCP manage applying all contrast themes (on linux), not only high contrast
2014-09-08T12:14:15 <amilchev> so my question is
2014-09-08T12:14:37 <amilchev> do you know of any particular reason why there is no entry in linux.json about contrast themes whatsoever?
2014-09-08T12:15:11 <amilchev> it just checks if the "enabled" switch is turned ON and if so, returns  "HighContrast" value (not at all minding value for contrast theme)
2014-09-08T12:15:25 <jhernandez> well
2014-09-08T12:15:30 <jhernandez> is long to explain
2014-09-08T12:16:26 <jhernandez> but GNOME dropped the support of Low and High/Inverse themes
2014-09-08T12:17:04 <jhernandez> so that\'s the reason you won\'t find them in recent releases of gnome
2014-09-08T12:18:31 <jhernandez> recently I\'ve heard that some people wanted to bring them back
2014-09-08T12:19:07 <jhernandez> but I\'m not sure whether that effort will succeed or not
2014-09-08T12:19:38 <amilchev> ...yeah I take that as a "yes, there is a particular reason" :) ..
2014-09-08T12:19:47 <jhernandez> heh
2014-09-08T12:19:48 <jhernandez> yes
2014-09-08T12:20:37 <jhernandez> as far as I can tell, GNOME dropped all a11y-related themes execpting the HighContrast one
2014-09-08T12:22:00 <jhernandez> why? they weren\'t being maintained good enough and also, gnome-shell\'s magnifier was being improved at that time with "tint/color" features
2014-09-08T12:24:02 <amilchev> ok then.. just wondered if I could make PCP user experience more awesome
2014-09-08T12:24:11 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-09-08T12:24:18 <amilchev> but thanks for the good answer anyway..
2014-09-08T12:24:21 <amilchev> (y)
2014-09-08T12:24:30 <jhernandez> let me think a little about it
2014-09-08T12:24:56 <jhernandez> but I\'m specially concerned about the "cross-platform" user experience
2014-09-08T12:25:45 <jhernandez> because we don\'t have the same a11y features in all the platforms
2014-09-08T12:29:57 <jhernandez> in any case, I\'ll ping Joseph (aka clown)
2014-09-08T12:29:58 * Bosmon2 joined the channel
2014-09-08T12:30:43 <jhernandez> he knows about that new effort on bringing those themes back
2014-09-08T12:31:10 <amilchev> okay..sounds nice, thx
2014-09-08T12:31:32 * Bosmon has quit
2014-09-08T12:32:06 <amilchev> jhernandez it\'s not an issue in the roadmap by the way, it\'s just a thought i had and decided to ask a few people about..
2014-09-08T12:33:35 <jhernandez> nice, I think that this is a great improvement too

2014-09-08T15:12:28 <Justin_o> clown: this goes back to a question I had a week or so ago about aria-controls. You had mentioned that it could be added to a  group of radio buttons. How would that look in the markup?
2014-09-08T15:14:24 <clown> Justin_o:  are your radio buttons native?  That is <input type="radio" \xe2\x80\xa6>?  If so, are they not grouped (I forget the HTML element for the grouping)?
2014-09-08T15:15:57 <Justin_o> clown: i think we mostly have native.. or the may be all native
2014-09-08T15:16:08 <Justin_o> clown: i think the grouping happens by supplying a name attribute
2014-09-08T15:16:11 <Justin_o> but i could be mistaken
2014-09-08T15:23:08 <clown> Justin_o:  sorry for the delay, but I needed to finish and send an email.  Let me look at the "radiogroup"  role...
2014-09-08T15:23:22 <Justin_o> clown: thanks
2014-09-08T15:27:44 <clown> Justion_o:  I confess I don\'t know for sure. So I would try two approaches, and look at the a11y tree.  To start, though:  What element is controlling the radio buttons your case?
2014-09-08T15:28:08 <Justin_o> the radio button updates a status area
2014-09-08T15:28:23 <Justin_o> so it\'s the radio buttons that are controlling the status
2014-09-08T15:28:27 <clown> oh, my bad.  The radio button *is* the controller?
2014-09-08T15:28:48 <clown> in that case, what is the @id of the status area?
2014-09-08T15:29:56 <clown> I\'m assuming you have something like:  <div role="status"  id="bestStatusAreaEver" \xe2\x80\xa6>, or some such.
2014-09-08T15:31:59 <Justin_o> clown: i think the id is generated so it could be anything, but we should be able to find it out when the application is run
2014-09-08T15:32:29 <clown> Justin_o:  let\'s say it\'s the venerable "foo" for now...
2014-09-08T15:32:41 <Justin_o> clown: sounds good
2014-09-08T15:33:27 <clown> Then:  <input type="radio"  aria-controls="foo"> \xe2\x80\xa6 <input type="radio" aria-controls="foo" \xe2\x80\xa6> \xe2\x80\xa6  And so on.
2014-09-08T15:33:54 <clown> Each radio input has the aria-controls attribute.
2014-09-08T15:48:21 <Justin_o> clown: okay, thanks
2014-09-08T15:48:30 <clown> wlcm, Justin_o

2014-09-08T18:05:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: interesting
2014-09-08T18:05:45 <Justin_o> i wonder if that would work for the IoCTesting framework

2014-09-08T18:29:37 <cindyli> oh, good to know
2014-09-08T18:29:38 <Justin_o> however i instead made it part of the component configuration since i\'d need to access it in more than one place
