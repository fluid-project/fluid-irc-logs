b"2014-10-09T16:38:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: are you removing the IE8 stylesheet from the prefsFramework?
2014-10-09T16:38:37 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o
2014-10-09T16:39:00 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you remove all the conditional comments related to it from the various html files?
2014-10-09T16:39:07 <cindyli> yes
2014-10-09T16:40:22 <cindyli> Justin_o: removed both ie8 style sheet from prefs framework and the uiOptions demo, as well as the conditional block
2014-10-09T16:40:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks..
2014-10-09T16:40:55 <cindyli> np
2014-10-09T17:02:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I looked into amilchev's issue some more - I was going to write up a JIRA for the poor diagnostic, but I see that he is actually using a very old version of Infusion
2014-10-09T17:02:13 <Bosmon> And I think that this problem has been resolved in the meantime
2014-10-09T17:02:29 <Bosmon> When you have a moment, perhaps you could try to get him to update
2014-10-09T17:03:19 <Bosmon> This behaviour was improved as a result of http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4890
2014-10-09T17:03:26 <Bosmon> Which looks like it got into trunk around May
2014-10-09T17:03:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i didn't realize it had been so long since we updated Infusion there
2014-10-09T17:04:58 <Bosmon> The FLUID-4890 fix put in a new framework utility fluid.isDestroyed() which allows the framework to tell whether it has been asked to perform an action on a component which has already been destroyed
2014-10-09T17:05:08 <Bosmon> And his build of Infusion clearly predates that point
2014-10-09T17:05:29 <Bosmon> Well, I see the date at the top
2014-10-09T17:05:32 <Bosmon> it is actually 13th May
2014-10-09T17:05:38 <Bosmon> So it even predates the 1.5 release
2014-10-09T17:07:08 <Bosmon> Ironically exactly the same day michelled pushed the fix for this issue :)
2014-10-09T17:08:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so we just missed it
2014-10-09T17:08:54 <Justin_o> was that a friday by any chance?
2014-10-09T17:09:09 <Bosmon> Tuesday
2014-10-09T17:09:31 <Justin_o> so not completely bad luck

2014-10-09T19:27:53 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think i've finished my changes for removing fss
2014-10-09T19:28:11 <anastasiac> Justin_o, which files have you been working on?
2014-10-09T19:29:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the prefs framework related files other than the assorted content demo.. although the separated panel there should be okay now too
2014-10-09T19:29:44 <anastasiac> Justin_o, how is this looking to you? http://172.16.2.64:8888/source/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/
2014-10-09T19:30:20 <Justin_o> it's looking good, i like the infusion logo in the button :)
2014-10-09T19:30:34 <anastasiac> it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go away with a theme, though
2014-10-09T19:30:56 <anastasiac> not sure if that\xe2\x80\x99s a bug or if the integrator should be doing that
2014-10-09T19:31:21 <Justin_o> in the Array Values fieldset the sample array is all the way to the right, is that intentional?
2014-10-09T19:31:38 <anastasiac> yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s intentional
2014-10-09T19:31:43 <anastasiac> testing floats
2014-10-09T19:31:46 <Justin_o> ah okay
2014-10-09T19:31:53 <Justin_o> as for the button image thing, i'm not sure
2014-10-09T19:32:05 <Justin_o> i guess we would have hoped it would been removed, but I'm not completely sure
2014-10-09T19:32:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you know?
2014-10-09T19:32:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: are the themes removing background images?
2014-10-09T19:33:13 <cindyli> yes, i think so
2014-10-09T19:33:19 <anastasiac> cindyli, specifically: should a uio theme remove a background image from a button element?
2014-10-09T19:33:50 <cindyli> let me check
2014-10-09T19:35:21 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do we already have a jira for removing Comic Sans and replacing it with a dyslexia-friendly font?
2014-10-09T19:37:05 <anastasiac> like opendyslexic http://opendyslexic.org/
2014-10-09T19:38:04 <cindyli> Justin_o, anastasiac, the background image is only removed from body and on off switches, not for buttons on the content
2014-10-09T19:38:41 <anastasiac> hm. Seems like a bug to me, i.e. I think uio should do that. What do you think, cindyli and Justin_o? Should I file an issue?
2014-10-09T19:38:48 <anastasiac> an \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement request\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-10-09T19:38:50 <anastasiac> ?
2014-10-09T19:39:01 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i don't think so
2014-10-09T19:39:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes, for the button background image issue
2014-10-09T19:48:12 <cindyli> Justin_o: my stylus branch is about ready. the only issue is themes won't apply correctly onto assortedContent page since it's still using the old one. do you think if I should merge in ur fss removal branch into my branch to have the new assortedContent?
2014-10-09T19:48:39 <Justin_o> anastasiac: what do you think?
2014-10-09T19:50:08 <anastasiac> cindyli, if you want to merge an assortedContent branch, merge mine - I\xe2\x80\x99ve updated the styling from Justin_o\xe2\x80\x99s
2014-10-09T19:50:15 <anastasiac> but should you merge at all, or not?
2014-10-09T19:50:20 <anastasiac> what would be the alternative?
2014-10-09T19:50:38 <anastasiac> https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/tree/FLUID-5469
2014-10-09T19:51:27 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking don\xe2\x80\x99t merge the FLUID-5469 branch
2014-10-09T19:51:36 <cindyli> anastasiac: the alternative is I file a new jira to make sure the new assortedContent works fine once Justin_o's or your branch make into the master. it's not worth to fix the old page
2014-10-09T19:51:52 <cindyli> anastasiac: why not?
2014-10-09T19:52:24 <anastasiac> oh, now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know
2014-10-09T19:52:44 <anastasiac> I had a reason, but when I started to type it, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold up
2014-10-09T19:52:53 <cindyli> :)
2014-10-09T19:52:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: i suppose you could also just create a test branch to try them together in
2014-10-09T19:53:06 <Justin_o> i'm fine with whatever though
2014-10-09T19:53:16 <anastasiac> Does gettign the manual test to work count as part of \xe2\x80\x98removing fss\xe2\x80\x99 or as part of \xe2\x80\x98updating the themes to work without fss'
2014-10-09T19:54:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think part of removing fss
2014-10-09T19:54:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think the contrast themes should be identical
2014-10-09T19:54:49 <Justin_o> after they are generated.
2014-10-09T19:54:55 <anastasiac> Justin_o, then the 5469 branch should worry about it, not cindy\xe2\x80\x99s branch
2014-10-09T19:55:53 <cindyli> anastasiac: but my branch would have a manual test page that applying theme onto it is broken
2014-10-09T19:55:59 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i guess the assorted content manual test isn't working for cindyli because she removed the fss specific styles from the themes, but yes i think this should be an issue for FLUID-5469 since the rest should be the same
2014-10-09T19:56:38 * anvk has quit
2014-10-09T19:56:49 <cindyli> Justin_o and anastasiac, maybe i can send a pull request with a comment on why that page is broken and where it will be fixed
2014-10-09T19:57:00 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure
2014-10-09T19:57:05 <cindyli> cool
2014-10-09T19:57:44 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac - do you know what license the Fluid website should be released under? Fluid docs is under CC-Attribution, so I assume the same?

2014-10-09T12:45:29 <amilchev> hey Justin_o
2014-10-09T12:45:41 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello
2014-10-09T12:46:34 <amilchev> what specifically needs to be supplied when defining a viewComponent as we talked yesterday
2014-10-09T12:47:21 <amilchev> I\'m still getting the same error "Instantiation of autoInit component with type fluid.prefs.separatedPanel.renderIframe failed, since selector " #gpiic-pcp .flc-prefsEditor-iframe " did not match any markup in the document"
2014-10-09T12:47:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: it sounds like it\'s missing its container
2014-10-09T12:47:44 <amilchev> here\'s the js part https://code.stypi.com/lmv3xv2h
2014-10-09T12:49:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: are you trying to test the pcp?
2014-10-09T12:50:14 <Justin_o> i don\'t think you\'ve passed in your pcp grade.. or i might just be missing it.. so what\'s probably happening is that it\'s using the default prefsEditor which is a separated panel, which is why it is looking for the iframe
2014-10-09T12:51:23 <amilchev> options: {
2014-10-09T12:51:23 <amilchev> gradeNames: "{pcpStatusMessages}.createPrefs"
2014-10-09T12:51:23 <amilchev> }
2014-10-09T12:51:35 <amilchev> Justin_o so should I assume this doesn\'t work
2014-10-09T12:52:25 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-10-09T12:53:02 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-10-09T12:55:35 <Justin_o> amilchev: no that should work, i mean it seems to be working, but you didn\'t add your gpii pcp grade, which you should probably add there as well
2014-10-09T12:55:42 <Justin_o> or as an option to that
2014-10-09T12:58:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: this might give you an idea... https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/UIOptions.js
2014-10-09T12:58:57 <Justin_o> it\'s not exactly the same, i\'ll see if i can find a better example
2014-10-09T13:03:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: here\'s another example. again not one-to-one with your case
2014-10-09T13:03:39 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/fullPage-schema/js/prefsEditorFullPageSchema.js
2014-10-09T13:04:13 <Justin_o> it uses the fluid..prefs.create function, but see how we have to pass in the prefsEditorType option to specify the type of prefsEditor that we want, to override the default.
2014-10-09T13:04:17 <Justin_o> you\'ll need to do the same thing
2014-10-09T13:04:57 <Justin_o> so you should be able to add something like this  prefsEditorType: "fluid.prefs.fullPreview" to your pcp component\'s options block
2014-10-09T13:10:51 <amilchev> Justin_o: you could check again in stypi
2014-10-09T13:11:06 <amilchev> the line I added and the new error stack trace
2014-10-09T13:12:08 <Justin_o> amilchev: what\'s at infusion-prefsFramework.js:15236
2014-10-09T13:12:15 <Justin_o> for you
2014-10-09T13:12:51 <amilchev> the exact line is " fluid.each(shadows[i].distributions, function (distribution) { "
2014-10-09T13:12:58 <amilchev> you could make a search from this i guess..
2014-10-09T13:16:25 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. it looks like i have the same one as you
2014-10-09T13:16:54 <Justin_o> i\'m not really sure what\'s going wrong here though :( would probably need to step through this with a debugger.. can you try to track down why the shadows are undefined
2014-10-09T13:17:42 <amilchev> Justin_o: sure
2014-10-09T13:18:40 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, what is "demo.pcp"
2014-10-09T13:19:45 <amilchev> Justin_o: oh I forgot to delete this, it\'s just what I decided to try before a while
2014-10-09T13:19:53 <amilchev> but still getting the same error after removing it
2014-10-09T13:21:26 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. okay.. let me know if you track down anything with shadows being undefined.. also you may want to try a different type of prefsEditor to see if that gives the same error or not
2014-10-09T13:22:34 <amilchev> Justin_o prefsEditorType: "fluid.prefs.fullPreview" still returns the same
2014-10-09T13:22:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. okay..

2014-10-09T13:23:35 <amilchev> Justin_o by the way what do you use for debugging? I\'ve used FF\'s debugger but sometimes it drives me crazy :) if you could suggest anything better, it\'d be nice
2014-10-09T13:23:55 * jessm joined the channel
2014-10-09T13:24:46 <Justin_o> um... i use both firebug and the built in developer tools for the firefox.. i\'ll also switch to use chrome or safari (I\'m on a mac) and use their built in debuggers.. sometimes you get more helpful error messages from a different tool
2014-10-09T13:24:53 <Justin_o> but i primarily test on firefox
2014-10-09T13:25:37 <amilchev> Justin_o cool thx

2014-10-09T13:32:19 <amilchev> Justin_o: the first time thatStack is a 1 object containing array
2014-10-09T13:32:31 <amilchev> and the object has nickname pcpStatusMessages
2014-10-09T13:33:08 <amilchev> tell me if you need anything specific..

2014-10-09T13:36:33 <Justin_o> amilchev: not sure, would you be able to push this up in a branch. cindyli  and I will try it out
2014-10-09T13:36:53 <amilchev> Justin_o sure, thank you
2014-10-09T13:39:07 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, are you sure you included all the js files you need
2014-10-09T13:40:39 <amilchev> Justin_o here is the branch https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/tree/buildError
2014-10-09T13:41:18 <amilchev> if you mean "everything needed for PCP rendering" the answer must be "yes", since I used to have it all rendered before starting to try these stuff
2014-10-09T13:43:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay, just double checking :)
2014-10-09T13:43:52 <amilchev> yeah..thanks Justin_o cindyli
2014-10-09T13:45:28 <Justin_o> this may not be related but are you getting this error too "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/robotoslab/v6/y7lebkjgREBJK96VQi37ZrrIa-7acMAeDBVuclsi6Gc.woff.

2014-10-09T13:59:12 <amilchev> Justin_o no, I\'m not getting this error
2014-10-09T13:59:36 <amilchev> but I think I\'ve seen that once (totally unrelated to gpii) - then it had sth to do with an image file being protected
2014-10-09T14:01:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: an image file being protected?
2014-10-09T14:01:33 <Justin_o> anyways, we should probably look into it later and try to clean that up
2014-10-09T14:01:44 <Justin_o> but yah, i doubt it has anything to do with this current issue
2014-10-09T14:04:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: I wasn\'t able to get the pixel by pixel data for an image from another domain - the error kind of reminded me of that.. but it should be quite different
2014-10-09T14:04:14 <amilchev> but no, I haven\'t seen that in gpii..
2014-10-09T14:04:33 <Justin_o> amilchev: i think this is for a font or something, could be in one of css files, but i didn\'t really dig into it

2014-10-09T15:23:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have any idea about what might be causing amilchev\'s issue. it looks like shadows[i] is set to undefined. However, I\'m not sure what the root cause of this is.
2014-10-09T15:24:48 * avtar joined the channel
2014-10-09T15:26:56 <Bosmon> Oh, looks like he is gone
2014-10-09T15:27:01 <Bosmon> If he reappears, could you ask him to check in his branch with a set of instructions to reproduce the problem?
2014-10-09T15:27:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: he created a branch, and the issues is just in the unit test. https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/tree/buildError

2014-10-09T15:28:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: although you\'ll need to change this line https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/buildError/tests/js/pcpStatusMessagesTests.js#L37 to use "gpii.prefsEditor" instead

2014-10-09T15:48:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve taken a short look
2014-10-09T15:48:39 <Bosmon> From a quick impression, it seems that what is happening is that the destruction of the component is being triggered before it is created
2014-10-09T15:48:54 * slim has quit
2014-10-09T15:49:01 <Bosmon> That is, the IoC testing framework observes that the test fixture is finished immediately, and so begins to destroy the component tree
2014-10-09T15:49:20 <Bosmon> Unfortunately it has not yet finished constructing because it is still waiting on the I/O from its templates
2014-10-09T15:49:40 * michelled joined the channel
2014-10-09T15:50:10 <Bosmon> I have to rush off for a bit, but I imagine that putting a single "listener" type fixture into the testing sequence, waiting for a suitable event, will make the framework wait long enough for the component tree to construct
2014-10-09T15:58:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s an interesting issue
2014-10-09T15:58:20 <Justin_o> thanks for looking

2014-10-09T16:26:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: looks like that worked, although there are other errors now but i\'ll pass this back for amilchev to continue  with
