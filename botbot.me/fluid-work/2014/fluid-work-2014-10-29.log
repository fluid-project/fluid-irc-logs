2014-10-29T11:57:43 <Bosmon> jhernandez - VERNANDEZ
2014-10-29T11:57:51 <Bosmon> KASPARNETT and I had a long chat last night
2014-10-29T11:58:00 <Bosmon> In which we realised everything I had told you to do is completely VRONGG
2014-10-29T11:59:01 <jhernandez> Bosmon: you wrong?! never!
2014-10-29T11:59:03 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-10-29T11:59:17 <Bosmon> I am wrong almost as often as I speak : P
2014-10-29T11:59:17 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-10-29T11:59:23 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-10-29T12:00:13 <Bosmon> So, I think we have no alternative but to go back to a slightly more "unprincipled" approach where the settings handlers deal in invalid JSON
2014-10-29T12:00:30 <Bosmon> That is, that the settings handler is happy to both return and accept structures which contain "undefined"
2014-10-29T12:00:50 <Bosmon> So the advice I gave you last night is all very well for encoding the missing values in a returned payload
2014-10-29T12:01:08 <jhernandez> ok
2014-10-29T12:01:12 <Bosmon> but it provides no scheme for allowing the settings handler to RESTORE missing values at the point of logout
2014-10-29T12:01:23 <jhernandez> that was my next question
2014-10-29T12:01:25 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-10-29T12:02:01 <Bosmon> So
2014-10-29T12:02:36 <Bosmon> The settings handler should return the undefined value in every returned payload to represent a missing value
2014-10-29T12:03:09 <Bosmon> When the returned payload is sent back to the SET method, it should apply the JS "delete" operator rather than simply trying to set the undefined value back again
2014-10-29T12:03:23 <Bosmon> Luckily we have a piece of machinery in Infusion which makes this easier
2014-10-29T12:03:42 <jhernandez> "Luckily"
2014-10-29T12:03:44 <jhernandez> :)
2014-10-29T12:03:45 <jhernandez> nice
2014-10-29T12:04:52 <jhernandez> now leaving for a walk with my dogz
2014-10-29T12:05:47 <jhernandez> but I\'ll do that as soon as I am back
2014-10-29T12:06:09 <Bosmon> jhernandez - the docs are here
2014-10-29T12:06:09 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/ChangeApplierAPI.md
2014-10-29T12:06:29 <jhernandez> Bosmon: cool - thanks!
2014-10-29T12:07:03 <Bosmon> Although there is a lot of material here
2014-10-29T12:07:08 <Bosmon> THe part of the API you need is here
2014-10-29T12:07:09 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/ChangeApplierAPI.md#programmatic-style-1
2014-10-29T12:07:21 <jhernandez> I guess that the rest of the settings handlers should be updated aswell
2014-10-29T12:07:29 <jhernandez> (not sure)
2014-10-29T12:07:36 <Bosmon> jhernandez - well so far I guess just the ones which deal in JSON-like material
2014-10-29T12:07:42 <Bosmon> So certainly the JSON settings handler
2014-10-29T12:07:50 <jhernandez> yes, right
2014-10-29T12:07:51 <Bosmon> The other ones may not have such a clear idea of "missing values"

2014-10-29T13:41:50 <jhernandez> BUT, when restoring, oldValues aren\'t being passed to the set method - getting the current ones
2014-10-29T13:50:18 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-10-29T13:51:11 <Bosmon> jhernandez - there are plenty of bugs in the old architecture
2014-10-29T13:51:15 <Bosmon> Just get your bit right for now : P
2014-10-29T13:54:31 <jhernandez> xD

2014-10-29T15:40:10 <sgithens___> I\'m torso deep in fiddling with issues on our production servers, I think I will still make the call... but if I don\'t show up immediately, well, it means I\'m still torso deep in fiddling with web app configurations.  For my report, I really just did LGS planning and mucked with installer issues this week.  I owe slim_jim (is that steve lee?) some emails
2014-10-29T15:40:11 <sgithens___> from threads I started with him.
