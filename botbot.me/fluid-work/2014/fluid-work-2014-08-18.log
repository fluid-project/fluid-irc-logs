b'2014-08-18T17:54:11 <anastasiac> cindyli, hopefully the upgrade won\xe2\x80\x99t take as long as the original install ;-)

2014-08-18T18:20:02 <cindyli> jhung: "cabal update" always shows there\'s a newer version of cabal-install, no matter how many times I upgraded it by running "cabal install cabal-install"
2014-08-18T18:20:46 <cindyli> no luck with building "pandoc", jhung. the log file shows
2014-08-18T18:20:47 <cindyli> cannot satisfy -package-id attoparsec-0.11.3.4-ce9cc311f68c5dadc8062ebb3ee69826:
2014-08-18T18:20:47 <cindyli> attoparsec-0.11.3.4-ce9cc311f68c5dadc8062ebb3ee69826 is unusable due to missing or recursive dependencies:
2014-08-18T18:20:47 <cindyli> scientific-0.3.3.0-8620052168afb47f172dbfbd5a3377c3
2014-08-18T18:21:59 <cindyli> scientific 0.3.3.0 was successfully installed. according to the log, could be, the rev version was wrong? or recursive dependencies? sigh\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-08-18T18:22:07 <jhung> :(
2014-08-18T18:23:31 <jhung> cindyli: I really don\'t know what could be the problem. Could it be a problem with Haskell? Unfortunately all this stuff is new to me too. anastasiac - any thoughts?

2014-08-18T18:25:06 <cindyli> i know, jhung. i hope there\'s another machine i can try with since anastasiac and you have no problem with installing it. do you still have a record of which commit you guys installed? maybe I can try that revision.
2014-08-18T18:25:11 <anastasiac> weird. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at all familiar, cindyli and jhung. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any trouble installing it\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-08-18T18:25:50 <anastasiac> cindyli, you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to install the development version of pandoc?
2014-08-18T18:26:08 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac, the latest repos
2014-08-18T18:26:20 <jhung> cindyli: I am using pandoc #5b1d841a6fe1713837344922bc53d08b550b4337
2014-08-18T18:26:40 <anastasiac> cindyli, are you following the isntructionso n this page? https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Installing-the-development-version-of-pandoc
2014-08-18T18:27:09 <cindyli> jhung: will try that version.
2014-08-18T18:27:17 <jhung> pandoc-citeproc #5fd47f90a748d662fa679798ead289cd72ae1b2f
2014-08-18T18:27:18 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac.
2014-08-18T18:27:35 <jhung> pandoc-types #f9db313f5231c4c52b38794a1a01295ba7913e09 cindyli
2014-08-18T18:27:40 <anastasiac> cindyli and jhung, I see that the most recent commit to pandoc was 12 hours ago, with the commit log \xe2\x80\x9cImproved osx build procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-08-18T18:27:49 <jhung> lol
2014-08-18T18:27:51 <anastasiac> perhaps we should let him know that the commit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really improve it :-)
2014-08-18T18:28:11 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m going to theorize that an earlier commit will work
2014-08-18T18:28:20 <jhung> or maybe the wiki is out of date?
2014-08-18T18:28:23 <cindyli> anastasiac and jhung, pandoc guys doesn\'t have an irc channel, tried to look up
2014-08-18T18:28:36 <anastasiac> cindyli, try the commits jhung gave you
2014-08-18T18:28:45 <cindyli> yes, i will, anastasiac
2014-08-18T18:28:53 <anastasiac> if that works, perhaps you could file an issue on the pandoc github repo with the problems you encountered
2014-08-18T18:29:04 <cindyli> good idea, anastasiac

2014-08-18T19:14:50 <cindyli> jhung and anastasiac, same issue with commit hashes that jhung gave. something specific with my machine. :(
2014-08-18T19:15:01 <anastasiac> blech
2014-08-18T19:15:27 <jhung> that\'s not good cindyli. :(
2014-08-18T19:17:33 <cindyli> i know \xe2\x80\xa6 will see what I can do
2014-08-18T19:19:04 <jhung> anastasiac - what are your thoughts? We need to get the code into a project repo.
2014-08-18T19:20:01 <anastasiac> jhung, cindyli, I think if cindyli thinks the repo structure looks ok, we should go ahead for now. You and I can both build it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong with the content of the repo itself
2014-08-18T19:25:42 <cindyli> anastasiac, jhung, the repo structure looks ok to me overall. One question I have is with "images" folder, README also mentions for adding videos in to the content, users should manually create "videos" folder. In the future, are we going to have more such folders like "audios", in that case, shall we place all these folders into one common directory like "contentResources", to keep them more together and separate from "tests" and "html"?
2014-08-18T19:26:23 <anastasiac> good questions, cindyli. Yes, there will be an \xe2\x80\x98audio\xe2\x80\x99 folder for the media overlay files
2014-08-18T19:26:25 <anastasiac> hm...
2014-08-18T19:27:38 <jhung> cindyli: we can create a videos folder and put a readme.md file in there.
2014-08-18T19:28:15 <anastasiac> jhung, does pandoc expect any particular file hierarch, or does it just blindly follow any relative paths it finds in the html file(s)?
2014-08-18T19:28:16 <jhung> for videos at least. I guess a similar thing can be done for audio as well.
2014-08-18T19:28:35 <jhung> anastasiac: it follows the path in the html.
2014-08-18T19:28:47 <jhung> if it doesn\'t find the source, it will give an error anastasiac
2014-08-18T19:30:02 <anastasiac> jhung, what do you think of putting the html, video, audio etc. folders inside a \xe2\x80\x98resources\xe2\x80\x99 folder?
2014-08-18T19:30:51 <jhung> anastasiac: that would mean putting everything into a resources folder, minus the tests. The tests directory would eventually be removed I think?
2014-08-18T19:31:20 <anastasiac> ah, I see, yes, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking about the purpose of the tests\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-08-18T19:31:35 <cindyli> ah, if "tests" is a temporary directory, a different story ..
2014-08-18T19:31:45 <anastasiac> so jhung, what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that eventually, this entire repo is content resources
2014-08-18T19:32:13 <anastasiac> plus, I guess, a readme or two, and perhaps a build script, eventually
2014-08-18T19:33:02 <cindyli> jhung, anastasiac, is this repo intended to be the home of one epub book or several?
2014-08-18T19:33:21 <jhung> anastasiac: that\'s what I was thinking. It would just be content needed to build the exemplar.
2014-08-18T19:33:52 <anastasiac> jhung, cindyli\xe2\x80\x99s question brings to mind a question I had: So far, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got three chapters. Can pandoc build those into a single EPUB? Right now, I seem to be building each chapter into its own EPUB
2014-08-18T19:34:34 <anastasiac> cindyli, I believe the repo is intended for only one EPUB, our exemplar sample. Is that right, jhung?
2014-08-18T19:34:39 <jhung> cindyli: that is a good question. I think we may want to handle multiple epub books (i.e. if we decide to make an exemplar of another use case).
2014-08-18T19:35:31 <jhung> anastasiac: with pandoc you can put multiple input files on the command line and it will make a single EPUB.
2014-08-18T19:35:50 <cindyli> anastasiac, jhung, do you think it\'s too early to create a repo structure that can accommodate several epub books?
2014-08-18T19:36:15 <jhung> cindyli: I don\'t think so. It\'s probably easier to do it now than later.
2014-08-18T19:36:24 <cindyli> cool
2014-08-18T19:37:11 <cindyli> jhung, anastasiac, our current structure doesn\'t seem to do a good job for accommodating serveral
2014-08-18T19:37:23 <jhung> I was thinking that we may want / need to illustrate another difficult use case, but it may not be physics or math. Perhaps it\'s something highly visual like a children\'s book?
2014-08-18T19:38:13 <jhung> cindyli, anastasiac - should we have 1 repo per book or 1 repo that can handle multiple books?
2014-08-18T19:38:39 <anastasiac> jhung, cindyli, I suggest: let\xe2\x80\x99s restructure it to accommodate multiple EPUB samples - one repo for all of our EPUB exemplars
2014-08-18T19:38:53 <cindyli> +1 on anastasiac
2014-08-18T19:38:59 <jhung> +1
2014-08-18T19:40:01 <jhung> This would mean that the top level would be the book directory, with its resources as sub directories.
2014-08-18T19:40:19 <jhung> Additional books will be sibling to the first book.
2014-08-18T19:40:51 <cindyli> jhung: does each book have a landing page like index.html?
2014-08-18T19:41:32 <cindyli> or index.epub
2014-08-18T19:42:28 <jhung> cindyli: not really. There is a manifest written in XML, but nothing like index.html
2014-08-18T19:42:44 <cindyli> ah. ok
2014-08-18T19:44:31 <cindyli> jhung, anastasiac: so the top directories are "books" and "tests". sounds good to me
2014-08-18T19:45:12 <anastasiac> cindyli, jhung, I suggest we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a top directory \xe2\x80\x9cbooks\xe2\x80\x9d but rather one top directory per book, named after the book
2014-08-18T19:45:39 <jhung> anastasiac: I was thinking the same thing.
2014-08-18T19:45:56 <anastasiac> so jhung, what would the name be for the book that will contain the three chapters you\xe2\x80\x99ve got so far?
2014-08-18T19:48:12 <jhung> anastasiac: I guess we\'d have to make something up. Maybe "Forces and Motion"? or just "Physics"? It should be descriptive so it\'s clear what the exemplar is attempting to illustrate.
2014-08-18T19:49:17 <anastasiac> ah, ok,  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize they weren\xe2\x80\x99t real chapters from an actual book!!
2014-08-18T19:49:19 <anastasiac> :-)
2014-08-18T19:50:07 <jhung> anastasiac: nope! They\'re adapted from learning units located on CK 12.org
2014-08-18T19:52:53 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ll make structural changes later tonight. Make sure you have committed any changes before leaving tonight.

2014-08-18T13:08:34 <sgithens> Is all the node v10 stuff awesome now?  I saw there was a pull but didn\'t look at it much
2014-08-18T13:08:38 <sgithens> that\'s pretty exciting
2014-08-18T13:11:17 <simonjb> sgithens: it\'s been ready for a while now but acceptance test instability is holding it up (the tests are less reliable under node 0.10 and my changes) -- Bosmon is working on a stop gap solution to make the tests run more reliably and once that is ready, we should be good to go ahead with node 0.10
2014-08-18T13:11:32 <sgithens> oh, that\'s right
2014-08-18T13:11:34 <sgithens> cool
2014-08-18T13:11:54 <simonjb> it\'ll be good to get it done
2014-08-18T13:12:03 <sgithens> for sure
2014-08-18T13:12:20 <slim_> sgithens: I have gone back to building the listeners with VS as GYP targets IDEs
2014-08-18T13:12:35 <sgithens> slim_ !
2014-08-18T13:12:39 <slim_> Not say we should use GYP yet though :)
2014-08-18T13:12:47 <sgithens> Cool
2014-08-18T13:12:58 <sgithens> Is it ready for another review?
2014-08-18T13:12:59 <slim_> hens!
2014-08-18T13:13:02 <sgithens> Do you want me to try it?
2014-08-18T13:13:33 <slim_> No yet - wait another day. I want to get the NTAG stuff stable
2014-08-18T13:13:38 <sgithens> cool cool
2014-08-18T13:13:49 <sgithens> and so, you said the USB and RFID are no longer together right?
2014-08-18T13:13:52 <slim_> UUIDs works as  far as I can tell
2014-08-18T13:13:53 <sgithens> but that they were
2014-08-18T13:14:21 <slim_> sgithens: correct  both separate binarys (.exe)
2014-08-18T13:14:46 <slim_> but I thought it make sense to put together as 2 projects under a single VS solution.
2014-08-18T13:14:56 <sgithens> simonjb : I got KasparNET, will fire up something in a sec
2014-08-18T13:14:59 <slim_> They will share libcurl
2014-08-18T13:15:07 <sgithens> yeah
2014-08-18T13:15:12 <slim_> for now I have not commited changes to USB tbuild though
2014-08-18T13:15:34 <sgithens> cool, and I honestly I don\'t if it\'s better for them to be in the same or separate binaries
2014-08-18T13:15:56 <sgithens> Bosmon: ping
2014-08-18T13:16:14 <slim_> sgithens: me neither but when we last discussed it was fell it would give beeter perception of security by reducing a taach surface
2014-08-18T13:16:19 <slim_> *attack
2014-08-18T13:17:56 <sgithens> I have Bosmon!
2014-08-18T13:19:17 <sgithens> we\'re looking at some plumbing work he\'s had done, just a sec
2014-08-18T13:20:43 <sgithens> simonjb He\'ll be like 10 minutes, some guys just showed up who are working on his house
2014-08-18T13:20:53 <sgithens> going to get a cup of coffee
2014-08-18T13:27:07 <Bosmon> Hi there

2014-08-18T13:32:58 <jhung> good morning cindyli
2014-08-18T13:34:37 <jhung> I was wondering if you have time later this morning to walk through the EPUB repository before we merge it to a project repository?
2014-08-18T13:38:12 <cindyli> sure, jhung. let me know when you are ready for it
2014-08-18T13:38:46 <jhung> cindyli: I think it\'s pretty much ready now. Currently it\'s a personal repository here https://github.com/jhung/EPUB
2014-08-18T13:39:20 <cindyli> ok, jhung
2014-08-18T13:39:47 <jhung> thanks cindyli
2014-08-18T13:40:51 <jhung> Let me know if you want to walk through it over Skype cindyli. Otherwise we can chat in the channel.
2014-08-18T13:41:26 <cindyli> skype would be easier, jhung

2014-08-18T16:22:41 <jhung> let me see cindyli
2014-08-18T16:24:10 <jhung> I think you can skip that step cindyli. We\'re not using citeproc. Try running pandoc now and see what happens.
2014-08-18T16:25:25 <cindyli> jhung: the problem is the executable pandoc is not generated.
2014-08-18T16:25:34 <jhung> hmmm
2014-08-18T16:25:34 <cindyli> let me check the second build on pandoc
2014-08-18T16:28:53 <cindyli> right, jhung, the second step at building pandoc also fails:

2014-08-18T16:30:04 <jhung> when you say "second step", which command were you executing cindyli?
2014-08-18T16:31:32 <cindyli> jhung: the command was "cabal install --force --enable-tests" in the section "Now install pandoc:" @ https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Installing-the-development-version-of-pandoc
2014-08-18T16:32:46 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - is michelled away today?
2014-08-18T16:33:13 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, she\'s off today and back tomorrow
2014-08-18T16:33:19 <Bosmon> ok cool
2014-08-18T16:33:20 <jhung> cindyli: checking\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-08-18T16:38:22 <jhung> cindyli, did you update your version of cabal? When you do \'cabal update\' does it tell you there\'s an update?
2014-08-18T16:38:39 <jhung> to install update you will have to run \'cabal install cabal-install\'
2014-08-18T16:41:51 <cindyli> u r right, jhung, there\'s a newer version of cabal
2014-08-18T16:41:56 <cindyli> trying..
2014-08-18T16:42:45 <jhung> If that works cindyli, I\'ll update the readme with that info. :)
2014-08-18T16:43:12 <cindyli> thanks, jhung, will let you know
2014-08-18T16:44:23 <jhung> ping anastasiac - got time to sync up?
2014-08-18T16:44:35 <anastasiac> eyp
2014-08-18T16:44:56 <jhung> anastasiac: we can do skype or in the channel.
2014-08-18T16:45:11 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m launching skype, jhung

2014-08-18T17:13:55 <jhung> anastasiac: fyi I am trying to fix a problem with the Video element encoding. For some reason the <source> elements are being wrapped in <p> containers which is throwing off EPUB readers.
2014-08-18T17:28:00 <cindyli> jhung: updated cabal and reran the installation steps. same error \xe2\x80\xa6 :(
2014-08-18T17:31:17 <jhung> cindyli: did you start from the beginning of the process?
2014-08-18T17:32:28 <cindyli> jhung: i didn\'t re-clone those repos, just re-ran all the installation steps. let me try with fresh clones
2014-08-18T17:34:42 <jhung> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t know if that will make a different cindyli. Let me see if there\'s any additional documentation.
2014-08-18T17:36:53 <cindyli> thanks, jhung, the interesting is, after I re-cloned "pandoc-types" repo, I ran "cabal update", it shows there\'s a newer version again. seems cabal is not globally updated.
2014-08-18T17:38:47 <jhung> ah okay cindyli. Let\'s hope that works.
2014-08-18T17:53:48 <jhung> anastasiac: fyi a new version of pandoc is available. See this post on how to upgrade. (I haven\'t done it yet) https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pandoc-discuss/oGAF2tIZ48U
