2014-10-21T19:15:09 <kasparnet> you can see I\'ve updated the pull request with a new testcase
2014-10-21T19:15:09 <kasparnet> https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-784
2014-10-21T19:15:28 <kasparnet> (scroll down to the savetests.js function)
2014-10-21T19:16:09 <kasparnet> but I realized that it\'s wrong
2014-10-21T19:16:35 <kasparnet> in that it doesn\'t check what event is fired from the requestProxy
2014-10-21T19:16:36 <Bosmon> hmm... looks like it didn\'t reach your pull request?
2014-10-21T19:16:45 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/279
2014-10-21T19:16:48 <Bosmon> I guess you have two branches
2014-10-21T19:16:52 <Bosmon> 941 and 784
2014-10-21T19:17:08 <kasparnet> yeah - so 784 is the work related to prefs/ontology server
2014-10-21T19:17:13 <kasparnet> it\'s a subset of 941
2014-10-21T19:17:23 <Bosmon> ugg
2014-10-21T19:17:39 <kasparnet> I can just do the one pull request
2014-10-21T19:17:44 <Bosmon> We may as well just consolidate everything
2014-10-21T19:17:48 <kasparnet> ok cool
2014-10-21T19:17:51 <Bosmon> Given we are just going to have a big "fireball merge"
2014-10-21T19:18:03 <kasparnet> I was only keeping them separate to make things simpler for the reviewer
2014-10-21T19:18:19 <kasparnet> so I\'ll do the merge with my latest changes once I\'ve adressed all your comments from GPII-784
2014-10-21T19:18:31 <Bosmon> ah well
2014-10-21T19:18:44 <Bosmon> Who knows what kind of review process this stuff could possibly go through : P
2014-10-21T19:18:56 <Bosmon> We might have to adopt an innovative process of "collective review".......
2014-10-21T19:19:43 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-10-21T19:20:01 <Bosmon> Ok, so SaveTests.js
2014-10-21T19:20:14 <kasparnet> yes
2014-10-21T19:20:23 <kasparnet> so I realize the link I sent is horrific
2014-10-21T19:20:29 <kasparnet> I was attempting to link a commit
2014-10-21T19:20:32 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-10-21T19:20:40 <Bosmon> I ignored your link and went to your pull request instead : P
2014-10-21T19:20:45 <Bosmon> but this might not have helped
2014-10-21T19:20:58 <Bosmon> Is it "PreferencesDataSource promise rejection"?
2014-10-21T19:21:06 <kasparnet> yes, exactly
2014-10-21T19:21:08 <Bosmon> ok
2014-10-21T19:21:12 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-10-21T19:21:13 <kasparnet> so I tried checking for rejected promises
2014-10-21T19:21:24 <kasparnet> or well
2014-10-21T19:21:40 <kasparnet> I tried rejecting the promise and then checking that the error was indeed sent
2014-10-21T19:21:49 <Bosmon> ok
2014-10-21T19:21:52 <kasparnet> which it is - even with my current faulty userSave.js implementation
2014-10-21T19:21:59 <kasparnet> (the one that always fires onSuccess
2014-10-21T19:22:03 <Bosmon> Seems promising, at least : P
2014-10-21T19:22:07 <Bosmon> ah
2014-10-21T19:22:15 <Bosmon> ok
2014-10-21T19:22:17 <Bosmon> So what\'s going on there
2014-10-21T19:22:23 <kasparnet> so what I guess I should do, is to check for the onError vs. onSuccess of requestProxy
2014-10-21T19:22:32 <kasparnet> but I\'m not sure how to do that
2014-10-21T19:22:40 <Bosmon> Well
2014-10-21T19:22:49 <Bosmon> I think checking that the overall response from the server is correct is adequate
2014-10-21T19:22:50 <kasparnet> unless I construct the { isError: true }
2014-10-21T19:22:55 <kasparnet> object in the userSave file
2014-10-21T19:23:05 <Bosmon> requestProxy is just one of a zillion possible routes to making the request fail
2014-10-21T19:23:27 <kasparnet> but it seems a sensible one
2014-10-21T19:23:29 <Bosmon> But what\'s this about the faulty userSave.js?
2014-10-21T19:23:46 <Bosmon> Sure, it\'s a sensible way of triggering it - but there\'s no point for checking for the failure using the particular triggering mechanism
2014-10-21T19:23:54 <Bosmon> When what you are interested in is the overall result
2014-10-21T19:24:21 <kasparnet> so usersave currently does this: promise.then(event.fire, event.fire);
2014-10-21T19:24:28 <kasparnet> where event is always "onSuccess"
2014-10-21T19:24:30 <Bosmon> oh I see
2014-10-21T19:24:35 <kasparnet> that should be changed to onError
2014-10-21T19:24:39 <Bosmon> So how do you get an error response out of this faulty impl?
2014-10-21T19:25:16 <kasparnet> saveTests.js line 105
2014-10-21T19:25:25 <kasparnet> ... but I guess that might be my problem
2014-10-21T19:25:36 <Bosmon> Well right
2014-10-21T19:25:45 <kasparnet> that the {isError} object creation is the responsibility of the userSave.js file
2014-10-21T19:25:48 <Bosmon> but what I mean is, how is it that the server actually produces a failure response?
2014-10-21T19:25:53 <Bosmon> WHen you actually fired the onSuccess event?

2014-10-21T19:26:54 * anastasiac has quit
2014-10-21T19:27:20 <kasparnet> well, it just passes whatever it gets from the promise to the event

2014-10-21T19:27:41 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2014-10-21T19:28:00 <kasparnet> so whatever is generated in saveTests.js:106 is what\'s received from the HTTP call
2014-10-21T19:28:09 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2014-10-21T19:28:13 <Bosmon> A cheat
2014-10-21T19:28:23 <Bosmon> One possible scheme could be to verify the HTTP return code
2014-10-21T19:28:45 <Bosmon> That should really reflect the actual error status of the request

2014-10-21T19:32:14 <kasparnet> yup
2014-10-21T19:32:43 <kasparnet> ok - well - I\'ll look at it tomorrow and hopefully have managed to adress all your comments by the arch. meeting
2014-10-21T19:34:15 <kasparnet> thanks for all your help on this Dr. Nig
2014-10-21T19:34:54 <Bosmon> kasparnet - thanks for your endless trudging up the long hill
2014-10-21T19:35:08 <Bosmon> And for me, I have just run my first test case executing a real asynchronous settings handler : P

2014-10-21T13:09:06 <jhung> anastasiac: If linking to Infusion documentation - is it better to link to https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/README.md or to its root?
2014-10-21T13:10:26 <anastasiac> good question, jhung. Ideally, we would link to the generated html that somonjb is working on :-) But since that\xe2\x80\x99s not yet available\xe2\x80\xa6 Where is the link, jhung? What\xe2\x80\x99s the context? FYI, I\xe2\x80\x99m leaning toward the link you\xe2\x80\x99ve pasted, and not toward the github repo root
2014-10-21T13:11:01 <jhung> The link is coming from the fluidproject website and from the build site.
2014-10-21T13:12:21 <anastasiac> Ok, I say link to the link you\xe2\x80\x99ve pasted, and file a JIRA to the effect that those links need to be updated to reference the generated html once it\xe2\x80\x99s available. The JIRA can be used to keep track of anywhere that will need updating
2014-10-21T13:12:29 <anastasiac> what do you think?
2014-10-21T13:13:12 <jhung> anastasiac: sounds good. I'll do that.

2014-10-21T13:56:40 <jessm> hey folks, i have a question re: our github repo
2014-10-21T13:57:50 <jessm> we\xe2\x80\x99re using it as a place to handle stuff we\xe2\x80\x99re actively working on (e.g. websites) but it also our proper repo for folks to come in and see and \xe2\x80\x9cget\xe2\x80\x9d our work (like UIO). How are we making it clear what\xe2\x80\x99s what?
2014-10-21T13:59:28 * clown joined the channel
2014-10-21T14:03:48 <anastasiac> jessm, not quite sure about the nature of your question. Are you talking about this list: https://github.com/fluid-project/ and trying to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s what?
2014-10-21T14:13:03 * jhung joined the channel
2014-10-21T14:13:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: I have master merged
2014-10-21T14:13:16 <Justin_o> for the FLUID-5469 pull request
2014-10-21T14:17:00 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, having a look
2014-10-21T14:17:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2014-10-21T14:41:28 <jessm> anastasiac: yes
2014-10-21T14:41:53 <jessm> anastasiac: more specifically, if potential users are pointed to our github repo and told they might like to integrate our work, where would they go from that list?
2014-10-21T14:43:18 <anastasiac> jessm, each repo has a description that displays on this page. Ideally, that would be filled in with enough info to help them figure that out. Clearly, some of our repos are missing that. It would be nice if we could group them somehow, to make it easier\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if github has provisions for that
2014-10-21T14:43:46 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how github decides to order the repos
2014-10-21T14:44:04 <anastasiac> probably activity...
2014-10-21T14:45:19 <anastasiac> yes, activity
2014-10-21T14:54:11 <jhung> anastasiac: I did a small tweak to my FLUID-5451 branch.
2014-10-21T14:54:21 <anastasiac> ok, thanks jhung
2014-10-21T14:54:25 <jhung> also I am starting work on updating the Fluid build site anastasiac
2014-10-21T14:54:39 <anastasiac> oh, excellent, jhung
2014-10-21T14:57:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: i fixed the issue with my pull request
2014-10-21T14:57:43 <cindyli> thanks
2014-10-21T15:01:15 <cindyli> not sure if you see the other comment about the demos link at https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5469/src/components/reorderer/css/ImageReorderer.css#L7
2014-10-21T15:01:18 <cindyli> can you fix that too
2014-10-21T15:01:19 <cindyli> thanks
2014-10-21T15:01:49 <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry missed that.. i'll take a look
2014-10-21T15:02:04 <cindyli> np and thanks
2014-10-21T15:02:37 <Justin_o> hmm.. i didn't realize we deprecated the image reorderer
2014-10-21T15:03:04 <Justin_o> oh.. sorry, this file itself has been deprecated
2014-10-21T15:03:36 <Justin_o> maybe i should just try to change the stylesheet to the one from the demo
2014-10-21T15:03:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2014-10-21T15:04:45 <cindyli> oh ok
2014-10-21T15:11:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you know why this comment is here https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5469/src/components/reorderer/css/ImageReorderer.css#L2-L7
2014-10-21T15:12:39 <anastasiac> Justin_o, no idea. 1.1.2 was a long time ago :-) I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing we were planning to re-do it, obviously
2014-10-21T15:12:53 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. i tried switching it and it breaks the styling
2014-10-21T15:14:51 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ah.. i don't think the original was being used in the demo..

2014-10-21T16:51:26 <kasparnet> Bosmon: So I'm adding a test for the rejected promise in my GPII-784 pull request
2014-10-21T16:51:53 <Bosmon> kasparnet - cool
2014-10-21T16:51:53 <kasparnet> and I have set up a datasource that will get called instead of the prefs server datasource
2014-10-21T16:52:02 <kasparnet> I'm doing the following in that function:    process.nextTick(kettle.wrapCallback(promise.reject));
2014-10-21T16:52:12 <Bosmon> Why are you deferring it?
2014-10-21T16:52:34 <kasparnet> I figured I'd have to retrun the promise before returning it
2014-10-21T16:52:42 <kasparnet> .. sorry  - it was taken a bit out of context
2014-10-21T16:52:44 <Bosmon> no, it's always fine
2014-10-21T16:52:46 <kasparnet> full function is:
2014-10-21T16:52:57 <kasparnet> gpii.tests.userSave.rejectedPromise.set = function () {
2014-10-21T16:52:57 <kasparnet> // This method is made asynchronous on purpose, to try to evade the
2014-10-21T16:52:57 <kasparnet> // exception handler inside route.js in connect.
2014-10-21T16:52:58 <Bosmon> The whole point of promises is that the operations can be done on them in any order, and it will all work out
2014-10-21T16:52:59 <kasparnet> var promise = fluid.promise();
2014-10-21T16:53:01 <kasparnet> process.nextTick(kettle.wrapCallback(promise.reject));
2014-10-21T16:53:03 <kasparnet> return promise;
2014-10-21T16:53:05 <kasparnet> };
2014-10-21T16:53:07 <kasparnet> ah nice
2014-10-21T17:02:09 <kasparnet> cool, it's working now! Cheers Bosmon
2014-10-21T17:02:31 <Bosmon> cool, KASPARRENTT!

2014-10-21T18:25:24 <kasparnet> I'm looking at your comment for the preferencesServer.js
2014-10-21T18:25:31 <kasparnet> in my GPII-748 pull request
2014-10-21T18:26:04 <kasparnet> the event in both cases where the setRawPreferences function is used is not a request or requestProxy, but instead a regular infusion event
2014-10-21T18:27:45 <Bosmon> kasparnet - right
2014-10-21T18:27:53 <Bosmon> You will need to dig up the correct error target from somewhere
2014-10-21T18:27:55 <kasparnet> so I'm not sure how to best handle this.. One option would be to always pass two events, one for failure and one for success to the function, and fire the appropriate one (ie. add a new event and listener to the component)
2014-10-21T18:28:11 <Bosmon> kasparnet - you can just inject it into the invoker if you like
2014-10-21T18:28:22 <Bosmon> {requestProxy} ought to be resolvable from just about anywhere

2014-10-21T18:28:47 <kasparnet> yeah ok.. so I would fire the {requestProxy}.onError in case it fails
2014-10-21T18:29:02 <kasparnet> and the rgular onRawPreferences event in case it's successful
2014-10-21T18:29:03 <kasparnet> ?
2014-10-21T18:29:14 <kasparnet> s/rgular/regular/
2014-10-21T18:29:59 <kasparnet> THat seems to make sense to me
