b'2014-09-18T18:58:02 <Justin_o> :(
2014-09-18T18:58:04 <Bosmon7> And it didn\'t seem to be a timing issue, since there was no change to numRequests at all during the test run
2014-09-18T18:58:32 <Bosmon7> Could you try on Firefox and see if you can get similar behaviour?
2014-09-18T19:00:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sorry had to stash some changes for in progress work.. I\'m using the branch i sent you with your test changes included.. it is still working in firefox for me
2014-09-18T19:00:38 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-09-18T19:00:45 <Bosmon7> Well, that is very odd ...
2014-09-18T19:01:04 <Justin_o> which line is causing the problem for you?

2014-09-18T19:38:57 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - no line in particular
2014-09-18T19:39:07 <Bosmon7> It\'s just that the expected event never arrives
2014-09-18T19:39:14 <Bosmon7> And there is never a change to the numRequests value
2014-09-18T19:48:58 <cindyli> hi Bosmon7
2014-09-18T19:50:10 <cindyli> i\'ve addressed most comments you and Justin_o made for my pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/41, except this one: https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/41#discussion_r17624759
2014-09-18T19:50:55 <cindyli> the part to - avoid cumbersome and special-purpose utilities such as "isTooltipDialogShareSameTarget"
2014-09-18T19:53:12 <cindyli> i\'ve pushed up the latest change where isDialogOpen and isTooltipOpen are tracked in the model but i found this utility is still needed.
2014-09-18T19:54:17 <cindyli> in the current code, the function name is simplified to "isShareTarget"
2014-09-18T19:54:18 <cindyli> are you suggesting to track that flag in the model too? is it necessary?
2014-09-18T20:07:03 <Bosmon7> Hi cindyli
2014-09-18T20:07:11 <cindyli> hi Bosmon7
2014-09-18T20:07:12 <Bosmon7> The approach is still not quite as we would have wanted
2014-09-18T20:07:24 <Bosmon7> You\'ve consolidated the logic, but it is still all view-level logic
2014-09-18T20:07:36 <Bosmon7> As in your giant function gpii.metadata.feedback.tooltipDialogInteraction
2014-09-18T20:08:10 <Bosmon7> I guess some state is stored in the model now
2014-09-18T20:08:17 <Bosmon7> But as it stands, this function is still very mixed
2014-09-18T20:08:36 <Bosmon7> For example, all the addClass/removeClass functionality should be implemented in terms of model listeners
2014-09-18T20:09:00 <Bosmon7> And ideally the "isShareTarget" function should be implemented as a relay constraint rather than in custom logic
2014-09-18T20:09:19 <cindyli> a relay constraint?
2014-09-18T20:09:58 <cindyli> like two model states are relayed to isShareTarget?
2014-09-18T20:10:27 <Bosmon7> cindyli - if this is possible
2014-09-18T20:10:35 <Bosmon7> Can you outline what the interaction should be?
2014-09-18T20:10:46 <Bosmon7> That is, what UI states are we interested in, with respect to isShareTarget
2014-09-18T20:11:08 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon7, the interaction is basically in the code comments:
2014-09-18T20:11:11 <cindyli> 1. If both dialog and tooltip are open for the same button, close the tooltip
2014-09-18T20:11:32 <cindyli> this is one place we need to check if dialog and tooltip are pointing to the same target
2014-09-18T20:11:38 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-09-18T20:11:44 <cindyli> 2. If both dialog and tooltip are open for different buttons, only show the arrow pointer for the tooltip
2014-09-18T20:11:54 <cindyli> another place for checking the same target
2014-09-18T20:11:57 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-09-18T20:12:12 <cindyli> 3. When the tooltip is closed but the dialog for another button is still open, add the arrow pointer back to the dialog
2014-09-18T20:12:26 <Bosmon7> Looks like both of these can be implemented by a model relay rule, that relays the model to itself
2014-09-18T20:12:48 <Bosmon7> Then everything else is implemented in terms of simple modelListeners
2014-09-18T20:12:55 <Bosmon7> And things which trigger .change( )
2014-09-18T20:13:46 <Bosmon7> You can see and example of this kind of style in the current pager
2014-09-18T20:13:49 <Bosmon7> e.g. at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/pager/js/Pager.js#L476
2014-09-18T20:15:10 <Bosmon7> Although in this case you would relay the entire model block containing both the dialog and the tooltip flags in one transform
2014-09-18T20:15:38 <Bosmon7> And you would write a set of rules that ensured the constraints that you listed in 1., 2., 3 above applied to the model
2014-09-18T20:16:04 <Bosmon7> After this, there would be a clear separation in the application between view logic and model logic
2014-09-18T20:17:19 <anastasiac> Bosmon7, I\xe2\x80\x99ve added a couple of new comments to your Pager migration tutorial pull request
2014-09-18T20:17:29 <Bosmon7> Thanks, amilchev
2014-09-18T20:17:31 <Bosmon7> er anastasiac sorry

2014-09-18T14:57:43 <colinclark> hey Justin_o
2014-09-18T14:57:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: hello
2014-09-18T14:58:21 <colinclark> I really enjoyed reading the channel logs of your conversation with Bosmon8 yesterday
2014-09-18T14:58:34 <colinclark> about datasources and queuing changes and so on
2014-09-18T14:58:57 <colinclark> interesting stuff
2014-09-18T15:02:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: oh thanks
2014-09-18T15:03:07 <colinclark> I wanted to ask about the failing unit tests you\'re struggling with
2014-09-18T15:03:17 <Justin_o> colinclark: i didn\'t get a chance to progress on the implementation of it yet, but hope to today.
2014-09-18T15:03:19 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2014-09-18T15:03:35 <colinclark> I had a talk yesterday with Bosmon8, who is himself struggling a bit with his workload
2014-09-18T15:03:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay
2014-09-18T15:03:53 <colinclark> After our meetings in Cambridge last week, there is a lot of work on his plate right now coming from Cloud4all
2014-09-18T15:04:09 <colinclark> and so I suggested to him that he needs to focus on bug at a time
2014-09-18T15:04:33 <colinclark> Which means he probably isn\'t going to be able to resolve your issue right away
2014-09-18T15:04:51 <colinclark> is there a way you can modify or rewrite your tests in such a way that the issue isn\'t a blocker for you?
2014-09-18T15:04:59 <colinclark> use raw QUnit or something if necessary?
2014-09-18T15:05:17 <colinclark> I don\'t want you to be stuck here
2014-09-18T15:05:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay that\'s too bad, but I understand there\'s for him to look at right now.
2014-09-18T15:05:42 <colinclark> yeah, it totally sucks
2014-09-18T15:06:11 <colinclark> I\'m worried that we\'re going to have a global revolt if we don\'t unblock pull request review and merging for the GPII repositories
2014-09-18T15:06:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: him.. i\'m not sure.. i guess i could look into it.. there was a lot o sequential stuff going on which may pose an issue, but i\'ll have to sort through it again
2014-09-18T15:06:17 <colinclark> ok
2014-09-18T15:06:28 <Justin_o> colinclark: for sure.. those need to get prioirty
2014-09-18T15:06:33 <colinclark> As an alternative, could you keep going without unit tests in some way?
2014-09-18T15:06:39 <colinclark> Make a "hack branch" or something?
2014-09-18T15:06:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: that is basically all done but for the tests
2014-09-18T15:06:58 <colinclark> (michelled will kill me when she gets back for suggesting this)
2014-09-18T15:06:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'d send a pull request for it if they were working
2014-09-18T15:07:03 <colinclark> ok
2014-09-18T15:07:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: so i\'ve moved on to other things in the meantime
2014-09-18T15:07:21 <colinclark> So you can continue on with other priorities in the meantime?
2014-09-18T15:07:22 <colinclark> ah, great
2014-09-18T15:07:33 <Justin_o> i guess i could still send a pull request with the caveat that the tests are failing, so we don\'t lose track of it
2014-09-18T15:44:25 <jhernandez> clown: hey, thanks for mentioning :)
2014-09-18T15:44:54 <clown> jhernandez, my pleasure.  (BTW, did the inteface change get in this time?)

2014-09-18T15:47:16 <colinclark> with a note explaining why you\'re making the pull request and what will need to be done before it can be merged
2014-09-18T15:47:53 <clown> back to what happened in gnome-a11y earlier today, jhernandez.  API decided:  "it would be good to know if some new stuff was added on the release" (accerciser, that is), and ...
2014-09-18T15:48:09 <clown> "he have time to came back here later or next week"

2014-09-18T15:49:25 <jhernandez> you did it right
2014-09-18T15:49:32 * clown pats his back.
2014-09-18T15:50:49 <jhernandez> thanks for "infoing" it there
2014-09-18T15:50:59 <jhernandez> this is it\'s been frentic to me
2014-09-18T15:51:32 <jhernandez> as of today my frentic week has finished
2014-09-18T15:51:38 <jhernandez> :)
2014-09-18T15:53:18 <clown> you\'re welcome, but we didn\'t "#info" anything.  It is in the chat log though (not sure where that exists).
2014-09-18T15:53:50 <clown> I found it:  https://meetbot.gnome.org/a11y-meeting/2014/a11y-meeting.2014-09-18-14.06.log.html

2014-09-18T16:37:32 <Justin_o> and i fire a requestQueued event when request is added to the queue.. when would you expect the requestUnqueued event to fire. When we start processing the request or after it has finished?

2014-09-18T16:58:18 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think requestUnqueued event should be fired after the request has been processed. The event can be fired with a success or failure signal
2014-09-18T16:58:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: i was thinking of putting it afterwards, then if it fails it can remain in the queue
2014-09-18T16:59:09 <cindyli> make sense
2014-09-18T16:59:52 <cindyli> Justin_o: what if the request cannot be processed due to the wrong request or so, would it stay in the queue forever?
2014-09-18T17:00:00 <Justin_o> yep
2014-09-18T17:00:09 <Justin_o> i suppose we could have a number of attempts or something
2014-09-18T17:00:25 <cindyli> ok
2014-09-18T17:00:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: right now we don\'t track errors in the datasource though
2014-09-18T17:00:40 <Justin_o> so there is no way to know if it succeeded or not
2014-09-18T17:00:48 <Justin_o> or rather, an error will probably just not return
2014-09-18T17:01:14 <cindyli> ok
2014-09-18T17:01:29 <Justin_o> i suppose we could look at improving this as well

2014-09-18T18:51:56 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o - I could still consistently get the behaviour that your tests would hang, rather than fail
2014-09-18T18:52:35 <Bosmon7> I couldn\'t easily see the reason why there should be a firing of the event numRequestsChanged at that point in the workflow, could you explain the connections?
2014-09-18T18:54:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sure i guess i\'ll start by explaining generally how the requests summary works. numRequests is the model used by the badge which goes over the requestSummary dialog icon in the feedback tool. It contains the total number of requests. It is updated any time a vote is added/removed and whenever a request is submitted/removed.
2014-09-18T18:55:19 <Justin_o> requests is the model used by the content of the requestsSummary dialog. It contains an object which has a property for each request type which have values relating to the number of requests
2014-09-18T18:55:32 <Justin_o> this is updated when it is opened and while open, whenever a vote is changed
2014-09-18T18:55:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: does that make sense?
2014-09-18T18:55:41 <Bosmon7> so the "clickMismatchDetailsLinks" action should submit a request of that kind?
2014-09-18T18:57:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes, I believe so
2014-09-18T18:57:29 <Justin_o> provide it is also submitting
2014-09-18T18:57:53 <Bosmon7> Somehow in my runs it didn\'t seem to
