2014-08-05T13:33:53 <amilchev> Justin_o: thanks!
2014-08-05T13:34:17 <Justin_o> amilchev: any reason in particular that you are using Ubuntu 12.04 and not 14.04?
2014-08-05T13:35:12 <amilchev> Justin_o: no reason.. just haven't updated
2014-08-05T13:35:36 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay

2014-08-05T14:01:09 <jhung> anastasiac: I'm back from vacation. I was wondering if we can sync up later this morning?
2014-08-05T14:01:28 <anastasiac> certainly, ping me whenever you're ready
2014-08-05T14:01:43 <anastasiac> I hope your vacation was good, jhung :-)
2014-08-05T14:04:18 <jhung> It was busy and fun anastasiac. Glad to be home though.

2014-08-05T14:49:21 <jhernandez> amilchev: Justin_o just seen amilchev's problems with ORCA+Firefox
2014-08-05T14:49:56 <jhernandez> I'm sure that it should work
2014-08-05T14:50:31 <jhernandez> amilchev: did you tried to turn Orca on before opening Firefox?
2014-08-05T14:50:51 * jhung1 has quit
2014-08-05T14:52:00 <jhernandez> usually, the problem is that Firefox doesn't expose its a11y stuff to at-spi2 until a11y is turned on
2014-08-05T14:54:18 <Justin_o> jhernandez: ah i think i've heard that mentioned before
2014-08-05T14:54:32 <jhernandez> Justin_o: amilchev http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Installation_Instructions_First_Pilots#Before_starting_the_tests
2014-08-05T14:55:12 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks
2014-08-05T14:56:21 <jhernandez> also, have http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Cloud4all_Pilot_2_-_Set_up_and_installation#Orca_Configuration_for_Firefox in mind
