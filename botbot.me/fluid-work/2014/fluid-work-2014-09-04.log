2014-09-04T18:18:58 <jhung> yes anastasiac
2014-09-04T18:19:05 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look

2014-09-04T18:52:24 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2014-09-04T18:53:13 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve renamed the handbook pages that we renamed in the ToC.
2014-09-04T18:53:39 <jhung> great thanks anastasiac.
2014-09-04T18:53:47 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking into getting something into the two new pages, so scanning the wiki to see if things are ready enough
2014-09-04T18:54:08 <jhung> I'm almost done the Math section anastasiac. I can migrate that when done.
2014-09-04T18:54:19 <anastasiac> great, jhung, thanks
2014-09-04T18:54:43 * Bosmon joined the channel
2014-09-04T19:05:58 <jhung> anastasiac: I'm going to start migrating the math content.
2014-09-04T19:23:41 <jhung> anastasiac: how do you go about attaching images to the ILDH?
2014-09-04T19:23:59 <anastasiac> ah, good question jhung\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-09-04T19:24:03 * anastasiac thinks
2014-09-04T19:24:42 <anastasiac> jhung, go to http://handbook.floeproject.org/index.php/Special:Upload
2014-09-04T19:24:54 <anastasiac> once an image is uploaded, you can reference it in the wiki markup
2014-09-04T19:25:54 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get something into the Testing and validation page
2014-09-04T19:26:13 <jhung> great anastasiac.
2014-09-04T19:54:29 <jhung> anastasiac: I have a quick style fix to the handbook. I am submitting a pull req. It adds overflow to <pre> blocks. Without it, our text overflows off the screen. :(
2014-09-04T19:54:45 <anastasiac> jhung, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look
2014-09-04T19:55:45 <jhung> anastasiac: https://github.com/fluid-project/handbook.floeproject.org/pull/19
2014-09-04T20:13:52 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to work out where/how to add a link to the exemplar to the handlbook. I\xe2\x80\x99m think of creating a ToC entry, before the last one (resources) titled \xe2\x80\x9cCase Study: Exemplar.\xe2\x80\x9d The link would be at the beginning of the page, and we can fill the page in with the details of how we created the exemplar. What do you think?
2014-09-04T20:14:19 <jhung> anastasiac: that sounds excellent.
2014-09-04T20:14:42 <anastasiac> so jhung, I think everything is merged into master and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to build and test our \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d exemplar, no?
2014-09-04T20:15:08 <jhung> anastasiac: yep. I'm going to get a clean copy of master now.
2014-09-04T20:15:33 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll work on the new wiki page
2014-09-04T20:15:55 <jhung> ok

2014-09-04T20:21:07 <jhung> one very minor correction anastasiac
2014-09-04T20:21:59 <anastasiac> response, jhung
2014-09-04T20:22:58 <jhung> works for me anastasiac. Merged.
2014-09-04T20:23:23 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung. avtar just left :-( I\xe2\x80\x99ll email him to ask him to pull from master one last time\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-09-04T20:24:20 <jhung> ok anastasiac. If we don't get this pull in on time, we can add the exemplar to the root of the EPUB content.
2014-09-04T20:24:29 <anastasiac> good idea
2014-09-04T20:24:54 <jhung> I'm checking the exemplar now.

2014-09-04T20:47:10 <jhung> anastasiac: I think so. I'm going to move the EPUB to a different location now and then update the link.

2014-09-04T13:56:05 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a metadata pull request for you soon :-)

2014-09-04T14:01:54 <jhung> anastasiac: Regarding the "Adding Forces" header. Right now it is a H1. I was wondering if it makes more sense to have it H2 since it goes with the 2nd chapter?

2014-09-04T14:11:15 <jhung> anastasiac: True. I\'ll leave it H1.

2014-09-04T14:19:16 <jhung> anastasiac: regarding the inline formatting of math - this is the unstyled result. Maybe we should add a class to all our math containers so we can make them look prettier?
2014-09-04T14:20:22 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we need something on everything. Most of the math is in a list or something, which seem to be left-justified by default. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just because this stuff is inline that it looks odd.
2014-09-04T14:21:31 <jhung> anastasiac: ok. I\'ll change the span to div and that should fix it for this case.
2014-09-04T14:24:02 <anastasiac> jhung, there\xe2\x80\x99s some problem with the video in chapter 2: it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even show up in ibooks, and in readium I can\xe2\x80\x99t activate the controls :-(
2014-09-04T14:24:09 <anastasiac> investigating
2014-09-04T14:29:09 <jhung> anastasiac: I think I know what happened\xe2\x80\xa6 let me investigate too.
2014-09-04T14:29:36 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue with the metadata for now
2014-09-04T14:30:42 <jhung> anastasiac: I thought perhaps I had accidentally committed a deletion to the Video directory, but it doesn\'t seem like it.
2014-09-04T14:30:53 <anastasiac> ok, jhung

2014-09-04T14:34:14 <anastasiac> ah, a size thing. interesting...
2014-09-04T14:34:48 <anastasiac> I still can\xe2\x80\x99t activate the controls in readium, jhung
2014-09-04T14:38:33 <jhung> anastasiac: if you right-click on a video, you can still control the video that way. For now at least we can use it.
2014-09-04T14:38:42 <anastasiac> ok
2014-09-04T14:40:06 <anastasiac> jhung, once I use that technique, the controls start working :-/
2014-09-04T14:41:00 <jhung> not for me anastasiac. :( It only works if the video was playing. but if you pause, the controls are broken again.
2014-09-04T14:41:07 <jhung> For me anyway
2014-09-04T14:43:36 <jhung> Update pull request anastasiac https://github.com/fluid-project/EPUB/pull/6
2014-09-04T15:02:37 <anastasiac> jhung, the a11y metadata is totally breaking the validation, even if I define the schema namespace. blech
2014-09-04T15:03:08 <jhung> :/
2014-09-04T15:08:46 <amilchev> Justin_o: btw I checked on my virtual fedora 17 - it has low contrast & invert colors http://ctrlv.in/420381 http://ctrlv.in/420379 (from universal access settings)
2014-09-04T15:12:44 <Justin_o> amilchev: interesting.. in fedora 20 it\'s "High Contrast" with on/off toggle
2014-09-04T15:14:42 <anastasiac> jhung, I found out how to properly declare the schema prefix for the a11y md, so validation works now
2014-09-04T15:16:31 <jhung> excellent anastasiac. I guess we should add a "Metadata" section to our ToC now?
2014-09-04T15:16:55 <anastasiac> there is one, no?
2014-09-04T15:17:00 <jhung> Actually there\'s already "Accessibility Metadata", but it\'s not strictly a11y is it?
2014-09-04T15:17:19 <anastasiac> yeah, this is pretty much a11y related
2014-09-04T15:17:24 <jhung> ok.
2014-09-04T15:17:24 <anastasiac> I say we leave it
2014-09-04T15:23:54 <jhung> updated pull https://github.com/fluid-project/handbook.floeproject.org/pull/18 anastasiac
2014-09-04T15:24:04 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2014-09-04T15:25:22 <jhung> I\'m going to start on fixing up the math content anastasiac. I\'m going to create a new sub document so we don\'t get merge conflicts on the wiki.
2014-09-04T15:25:46 <anastasiac> jhung, what do you mean  a new sub document?
2014-09-04T15:26:18 <jhung> a child document to the EPUB Developer Guide in the Fluid wiki anastasiac
2014-09-04T15:26:38 <anastasiac> ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it jhung
2014-09-04T15:26:49 <jhung> k
2014-09-04T15:38:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: if i\'m specifying an invoker which performs a change on the model, and want to use the declarative form, can i add model transformations into there as well?
2014-09-04T15:42:14 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2014-09-04T15:42:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - model transformations are only used via modelRelay blocks
2014-09-04T15:42:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay... thanks
2014-09-04T15:42:58 <Bosmon> If you want a transformed action on a model, you will have to construct a new model area for the transformed representation
2014-09-04T15:44:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess that\'s another option, you mean create a new component
2014-09-04T15:44:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, just new model material
2014-09-04T15:44:29 <Bosmon> You can just set up a relay to another path in the same component
2014-09-04T15:45:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh really
2014-09-04T15:45:12 <Justin_o> it doesn\'t have to come from a model block
2014-09-04T15:45:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the issue is that the datasource returns the data in a different format than is needed by the model
2014-09-04T15:45:49 <Justin_o> so it returns something like {key: "", value: 10} when i just want 10
2014-09-04T15:45:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - sounds like a job for relay, or even just implicit relay
2014-09-04T15:45:59 <Justin_o> and assign that to some model path
2014-09-04T15:46:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what is implicit relay?
2014-09-04T15:46:25 <Bosmon> For example if you write myPath: {that}.model.dataSourcePath.value inside your model
2014-09-04T15:46:37 <Bosmon> It will set up a relay from the version as returned by the dataSource to "myPath"
2014-09-04T15:46:56 <Justin_o> the datasource just has get and set methods though
2014-09-04T15:47:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - by "dataSourcePath" I mean a model area that you assign the return value from the dataSource to
2014-09-04T15:47:20 <Bosmon> Not the dataSource itself
2014-09-04T15:47:34 <Justin_o> okay.. so my get will just update some place with raw values
2014-09-04T15:47:40 <Justin_o> and i\'ll only use this for transformations
2014-09-04T15:47:41 <Bosmon> So you might do applier.change("dataSourcePath", .... datasource\'s return value .....)
2014-09-04T15:48:08 <Bosmon> What is the dataSource in this case?
2014-09-04T15:48:17 <Justin_o> pouchDB
2014-09-04T15:48:26 <Bosmon> Yes, but I mean, what data is stored in it
2014-09-04T15:48:30 <Justin_o> but i\'m accessing a view
2014-09-04T15:48:34 <Justin_o> ah
2014-09-04T15:49:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - here\'s the docs on the implicit and explicit style
2014-09-04T15:49:02 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/ModelRelay.md
2014-09-04T15:49:03 <Justin_o> there are two different cases that i have to do transformations for. 1) get the list of requests and how many for each 2) get the total number of requests
2014-09-04T15:49:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right.. i was looking at this the other day..
2014-09-04T15:52:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s the function i had written prior to our conversation to handle the transformation https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-196/src/components/feedback/js/requestSummary.js#L188-L191
2014-09-04T15:52:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s an example of one of the transformations https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-196/src/components/feedback/js/feedback.js#L202-L218
2014-09-04T15:53:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so yes, this transformation can just be written in a modelRelay block
2014-09-04T15:53:28 <Bosmon> You can ask cindyli1 about this since she has done it elsewhere
2014-09-04T15:53:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
