2014-01-03T17:54:35 <sgithens_> colinclark: Do we JSHint the GPII code at all now?
2014-01-03T17:55:08 <sgithens_> is that something that has a github hook?
2014-01-03T18:02:50 <colinclark> oh hey sgithens_
2014-01-03T18:03:00 <colinclark> we definitely should be JSHinting the GPII code
2014-01-03T18:03:07 <colinclark> or using our fork of JSLint
2014-01-03T18:03:17 <colinclark> There's no Github hook, no
2014-01-03T18:03:24 <colinclark> yzen: Which do you use?
2014-01-03T18:03:30 <colinclark> the fork of JSLint or JSHint?
