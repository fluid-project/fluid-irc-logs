2014-10-24T11:59:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Is http://wiki.gpii.net/ really slow for anyone else?
2014-10-24T12:02:48 <the-t-in-rtf> 30+ seconds for this page:  http://wiki.gpii.net/w/SmartHouses_Preference_Sets
2014-10-24T12:05:42 <the-t-in-rtf> On a related topic, I am looking for the current Solutions Registry data or at least example records.
2014-10-24T12:05:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyone got a link?
2014-10-24T12:10:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Looking through various tickets in JIRA, I found a reference to this:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBiWpRJGEH8yNfy_5lHD2RzvD_D6imCZZQ8zxePDZQE/edit#heading=h.tzd8obwin0da
2014-10-24T12:14:11 <the-t-in-rtf> This looks like it:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/solutions

2014-10-24T13:33:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: good morning. I've filed a pull request for the fss docs stuff.. and made changes in there for some of the stylus work too. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/35
2014-10-24T13:33:50 <cindyli> awesome. thanks, Justin_o
2014-10-24T13:34:26 <Justin_o> could you please comment on that when you have a chance.. and if you have time, could you also talk to Anastasia about what docs we need for stylus. It seems like the prefs framework docs we have there now is pretty general. Or i could have missed the specific ones.
2014-10-24T13:34:45 <cindyli> Justin_o: yesterday i filed a pull request to remove pouchDB from the medata demo: https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/46, can you review it when you have a chance?
2014-10-24T13:35:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure
2014-10-24T13:35:49 <cindyli> Justin_o: sure, will look at ur pull and talk to Anastasia
