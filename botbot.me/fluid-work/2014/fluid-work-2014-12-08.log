2014-12-08T16:37:30 * Sepideh has quit
2014-12-08T16:42:59 <cindyli> Bosmon7: i'm working on this jira for the prefs framework - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5552
2014-12-08T16:43:36 <cindyli> plans for it: 1. replace the old component types with the new relay component types; 2. get rid of fluid.prefs.modelRelay
2014-12-08T16:43:41 <cindyli> does it sound good to you?
2014-12-08T16:43:50 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I believe this JIRA is a duplicate, just a second
2014-12-08T16:44:22 <cindyli> ok
2014-12-08T16:49:10 * Sepideh joined the channel
2014-12-08T16:50:06 <Bosmon7> cindyli - yes, it sounds good
2014-12-08T16:50:23 <Bosmon7> Note that we have a couple of serious bugs still open against modelRelay that you may run into
2014-12-08T16:50:34 <Bosmon7> It seems we don't have an existing JIRA for this work although I was sure we did
2014-12-08T16:50:44 <Bosmon7> I've done a bit of JIRA gardening to link the relevant issues together
2014-12-08T16:50:59 <cindyli> ah. ok. thanks, Bosmon7
2014-12-08T16:51:21 <Bosmon7> cindyli - in particular http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-230 is still open
2014-12-08T16:51:27 <Bosmon7> Leading to FLUID-5517
2014-12-08T16:51:33 <cindyli> yes, exactly
2014-12-08T16:52:07 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately I don't expect to get time to fix this before the EU review meeting for the GPII in mid-January
2014-12-08T16:52:19 <Bosmon7> But if you are lucky, the UIOptions conversion won't be impacted by the same bug
2014-12-08T16:52:40 <cindyli> we'll see :)
2014-12-08T16:53:10 <Bosmon7> Also, if the video player is upgraded too, if you want to test the integration, you will need to make sure to instantiate the two components together as part of the same IoC tree
2014-12-08T16:53:24 <Bosmon7> Until FLUID-5249 is implemented
2014-12-08T16:53:40 <Bosmon7> This will be a little unnatural for integrators, but it will at least allow you to test whether the integration can be successful

2014-12-08T16:55:09 <cindyli> reading 5249..
2014-12-08T16:55:56 <Bosmon7> So our current VP-UIO integration relies on a STRANGE SCHEME
2014-12-08T16:56:03 <cindyli> ok, i see, to make sure videoPlayer and uiOptions to work on the same IoC tree
2014-12-08T16:56:10 <Bosmon7> For mediating between whichever component is constructed first, and which is constructed second
2014-12-08T16:56:33 <Bosmon7> And is designed to support the var UIO = fluid.uiOptions()..... var VP = fluid.videoPlayer() style of construction
2014-12-08T16:56:49 <Bosmon7> So once these two components are both upgraded to model relay, not even the STRANGE SCHEME will work any more
2014-12-08T16:56:59 <Bosmon7> Since modelRelay can't act between components which are not part of the same tree
2014-12-08T16:57:26 <Bosmon7> The solution to this is FLUID-5249 which will automatically cause ALL components constructed anywhere to be part of the same tree
2014-12-08T16:58:14 <cindyli> ok. quite a bit rewriting
2014-12-08T16:58:42 <Bosmon7> Which in addition will allow us to get rid of the STRANGE SCHEME - which you can see implemented on this line here https://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer/blob/master/js/VideoPlayer_uiOptions.js#L200
2014-12-08T16:59:02 <Bosmon7> At the moment we do quite a lot of manual juggling in order to compensate for which component accidentally ends up being instantiated first
2014-12-08T16:59:33 <Bosmon7> This integration code was always very unstable and fragile
2014-12-08T16:59:48 <Bosmon7> And once we upgrade both VP to UIO to relay, it will stop working completely
2014-12-08T17:00:11 <cindyli> :(
2014-12-08T17:04:54 <cindyli> Bosmon7: do we have an equivalent relay type for fluid.littleComponent? i should be able to use fluid.standardRelayComponent for it, right?
2014-12-08T17:05:06 <cindyli> same as fluid.eventedComponent
2014-12-08T17:06:58 <Bosmon7> cindyli - all the model grades lie below littleComponent
2014-12-08T17:07:17 <Bosmon7> The parallel components at the next level are fluid.modelComponent and fluid.modelRelayComponent
2014-12-08T17:07:45 <cindyli> ah. ok. littleComponent and eventedComponent should stay as it is
2014-12-08T17:07:47 <cindyli> they are
2014-12-08T17:08:50 <Bosmon7> yes, those stay the same
