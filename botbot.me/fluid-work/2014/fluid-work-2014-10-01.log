2014-10-01T13:45:42 <Justin_o> michelled: do you know if there is a reason that the keyboard a11y demo is not an infusion component?
2014-10-01T13:45:49 <Justin_o> was this intentional?
2014-10-01T13:46:21 <michelled> keyboard a11y was considered part of the framework, I think, when it was first created
2014-10-01T13:46:46 <michelled> Bosmon might know - why do you ask Justin_o?
2014-10-01T13:47:06 <Bosmon> Once we had a plan that it would be contributed as a set of jQuery plugins
2014-10-01T13:47:21 <Bosmon> I think we made a decision about a year ago that it should indeed be recast as Infusion components
2014-10-01T13:47:29 <Bosmon> We can probably find the discussion on-line
2014-10-01T13:47:33 <Bosmon> I know you were part of it, Justin_o : P
2014-10-01T13:47:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh no i forget
2014-10-01T13:48:02 <Justin_o> michelled, Bosmon: i was actually referring to the demo itself though https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/demos/keyboard-a11y/js/keyboardDemo.js#L202-L203
2014-10-01T13:48:10 <Justin_o> as opposed to the source
2014-10-01T13:48:25 <Bosmon> I see
2014-10-01T13:48:42 <Justin_o> i am fixing up the styling for the demo for the FSS removal work, which went fine but it seems that there are some bugs with the component so i wanted to just fix it up along the way
2014-10-01T13:48:48 <Justin_o> bugs with the demo
2014-10-01T13:48:53 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-10-01T13:48:55 <Bosmon> The thinking there might have been to show how something which was only "partially" an Infusion component could be improved in accessibility without touching its code
2014-10-01T13:49:06 <Bosmon> You might want to talk to anastasiac in more detail about the thinking there
2014-10-01T13:49:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. seems reasonable.. i\'ll try to fix it up in its current form.. I\'ll check in with anastasiac, if she\'s in later
2014-10-01T13:49:53 <Bosmon> I think you should feel free to turn it into a proper component
2014-10-01T13:50:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh okay..
2014-10-01T13:50:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any specific reasons for tthat
2014-10-01T13:50:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, we\'re short enough on convincing, bite-sized demos of "the way we intend things to be"
2014-10-01T13:51:00 <Bosmon> It only confuses and dilutes the discussion to say, "This is how something *might* be, if you had bought into about 50% of our thinking"
2014-10-01T13:51:31 <Bosmon> The older version will always be about in github after all
2014-10-01T13:51:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i don\'t have any argument against that.. do you see any reason to leave things as they are michelled ?
2014-10-01T13:51:47 <Bosmon> Should anyone be interested in some archaeology
2014-10-01T13:52:24 <Bosmon> I know that it was hard to lay my hands on really convincing and compact examples of Infusion-aware code when atkins (the-t-in-rtf) asked
2014-10-01T13:52:34 <Bosmon> I had to point him at parts of the Uploader\'s FileQueueView etc.
2014-10-01T13:52:34 <Justin_o> :(
2014-10-01T13:52:39 <Justin_o> really
2014-10-01T13:52:41 <Justin_o> ?
2014-10-01T13:53:14 <Bosmon> Well, say someone came to you and said... "Where should I look for a really easy-to-understand example of a classic Infusion component, reflecting all of our current best practices?"
2014-10-01T13:53:19 <Bosmon> What would you point such a person to
2014-10-01T13:53:32 <Justin_o> yah.. i\'m not sure :(
2014-10-01T13:53:40 <Bosmon> so - go for ittt :)
2014-10-01T13:53:41 <Justin_o> the docs ;)
2014-10-01T13:53:44 <Justin_o> okay
2014-10-01T13:53:58 <Bosmon> Yes well, people only typically start to go for the docs once they\'re already partway into a project
2014-10-01T13:54:16 <Bosmon> And the typical way they start with a project is to mostly clone an existing one that is meant to be "classic" or "representative" in some way
2014-10-01T13:54:50 <michelled> makes sense to me
2014-10-01T13:54:50 <Bosmon> So the fewer things that we have lying around that represent a serious risk if someone were to clone them, the better
2014-10-01T13:54:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s a good point.. we should consider putting up a tutorial repo for people to start from at some point
2014-10-01T13:55:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. avoiding risks is a good idea
2014-10-01T13:56:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - but I was sure we already had a modern version of this demo
2014-10-01T13:56:06 <Bosmon> I remember writing it : P
2014-10-01T13:56:27 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2014-10-01T13:56:28 <Bosmon> This one
2014-10-01T13:56:28 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/demos/keyboard-a11y/js/five-star.js
2014-10-01T13:56:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  uh.. where is that from
2014-10-01T13:56:54 <Bosmon> OK, so about 50% of this demo has been modernised
2014-10-01T13:57:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s right there next to it in the same directory!
2014-10-01T13:57:30 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/demos/keyboard-a11y/js
2014-10-01T13:57:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  oh right.. that\'s the other half of the demo
2014-10-01T13:57:51 <Bosmon> So yes, it seems quite reasonable to modernise the other half of the demo
2014-10-01T13:58:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. sounds good
2014-10-01T13:58:19 <Bosmon> Or at least to put in a substantial comment explaining why the two halves of the demo are written in such substantially different styles : P
2014-10-01T13:58:57 <Justin_o> i wonder which will be easier :)
2014-10-01T13:59:24 <Bosmon> Yes - in theory it can be a lot easier to just fix something rather than to spend a lot of time explaining why it is broken
2014-10-01T13:59:34 <Bosmon> Although I know that many of our European partners would disagree : P
2014-10-01T13:59:47 <Justin_o> haha
2014-10-01T14:01:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - did I show you the fluid.promise.follow utility?
2014-10-01T14:01:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t think so
2014-10-01T14:01:48 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/commit/2ce052e42a4ddb46a27e2eb0d3284029c4f0ddcb#diff-8485f8db97b02a90ffdb5f2c75a02cf4R76
2014-10-01T14:01:51 <Bosmon> It consists of just 1 line
2014-10-01T14:01:58 <Bosmon> But I am coming to think that it is completely crucial
2014-10-01T14:02:26 <Bosmon> You may or may not know that there is a huge split in the promises community... between those who are what is called "Promises/A+" compliant, and those who are not (particularly jQuery)
2014-10-01T14:02:45 <Bosmon> But as far as I can see, all of the disagreements could be resolved by use of a utility such as this one
2014-10-01T14:03:18 <Bosmon> Interestingly the "Fluid micropromises contract" as embodied in our own library is so broad that it can easily accommodate promises which come from either camp, without needing to modify or wrap them in any way
2014-10-01T14:03:40 <Bosmon> And any algorithms which are coded against our contract (e.g. our "transform" algorithm in this file) could work equally well on all kinds of promises
2014-10-01T14:03:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what is the disagreement around? so this utility will just make sure if a previous promise is rejected that the subsequent ones will also be automatically rejected?
2014-10-01T14:04:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this is a utility which is used to "link" two promises together
2014-10-01T14:04:14 <Bosmon> Given two previously separate promises, it will link them so that one of them "follows" the other
2014-10-01T14:04:27 <Bosmon> So any operations which occur on the one called "source" naturally also happen on the one called "target"
2014-10-01T14:04:38 <Bosmon> The disagreement between the two camps relate to the way in which promises naturally chain together
2014-10-01T14:04:49 <Bosmon> So in the Promises/A+ camp, chaining is meant to happen implicitly and automatically
2014-10-01T14:04:59 <Bosmon> In that every call to promise.then() actually generates a completely fresh chained promise
2014-10-01T14:05:10 <Bosmon> Which I personally think is extremely opaque and confusing
2014-10-01T14:05:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i see.. so in this case someone using this would only have to write a single then against either of the promises?
2014-10-01T14:05:24 <Bosmon> Now in the jQuery camp, a call to then(), as with our own promises, does NOT generate a fresh promise
2014-10-01T14:05:32 <Bosmon> But what jQuery has is a rather confusing utility called pipe()
2014-10-01T14:06:54 <Bosmon> oh interesting, it seems that pipe() is now deprecated...
2014-10-01T14:07:45 <Justin_o> what did they replace it with?
2014-10-01T14:08:07 <Bosmon> It seems that as of jQuery 1.8 they adopted the behaviour more similar to the spec
2014-10-01T14:08:22 <Bosmon> Which seems an astonishing API change for a minor version
2014-10-01T14:08:23 <Bosmon> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
2014-10-01T14:08:32 <Bosmon> "As of jQuery 1.8, the deferred.then() method returns a new promise that can filter the status and values of a deferred through a function, replacing the now-deprecated deferred.pipe() method"
2014-10-01T14:09:17 <Bosmon> However it seems that this still doesn\'t make them spec-compliant
2014-10-01T14:09:18 <Bosmon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23951745/is-any-jquery-version-compliant-to-promise-a-specifications
2014-10-01T14:09:23 <Bosmon> This apparently will arrive in jQuery 1.12
2014-10-01T14:09:51 <Bosmon> Anyway, to my view, all of this subtle wrangling about the exact semantics of "then" seems very unhelpful
2014-10-01T14:10:34 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-10-01T14:10:55 <Bosmon> As well as the fact that the remaining differences all seem to relate to the semantic for exception handling, which some years ago we already decided was undesirable in JS
2014-10-01T14:11:13 <Bosmon> THe other difference relates to execution order
2014-10-01T14:11:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: we were talking a bit about the keyboard a11y demo.. it\'s currently not structured as a fluid component. We were thinking to update it to one now since i\'m in there fixing up the styles for the FSS removal. Was there any reason not to do this?
2014-10-01T14:11:48 <Bosmon> Or more precisely, execution TIMING
2014-10-01T14:12:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we\'ll be A+ compliant?
2014-10-01T14:12:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o, we won\'t
2014-10-01T14:13:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess it doesn\'t really matter though since these things aren\'t going to be directly used anyways
2014-10-01T14:13:32 <Bosmon> Mostly not, no
2014-10-01T14:14:05 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any particular reason why not to create a component, so long as we\xe2\x80\x99re clear Ii.e. in comments, etc.) what is and isn\xe2\x80\x99t required to use the plugin, since that\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s a demo of. For example, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to build an Infusion component to use the plugin.
2014-10-01T14:14:17 <Bosmon> I think it\'s interesting that although a lot of the "promise" (ha, ha) of promises is their use for building algorithms on top of, the very first 2 algorithms that we needed to use with them were ones that were not commonly implemented
2014-10-01T14:15:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s ironic..
2014-10-01T14:15:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. i\'ll keep that in mind
2014-10-01T14:16:23 <Justin_o> anastasiac: maybe i\'ll run it by you too, to make sure the comments are good
2014-10-01T14:16:44 <anastasiac> sounds good, Justin_o
2014-10-01T14:18:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this thread is very well worth reading, on the issue of promise resolution timing

2014-10-01T14:19:04 <Bosmon> What\'s interesting is that about 2 years after the thread effectively closed, a person appeared with seemingly a great deal of expertise to explain that the committee had made the wrong decision
2014-10-01T14:23:26 <Justin_o> hindsight :(
2014-10-01T14:24:46 <Bosmon> Well, the arguments are pretty subtle on either side
2014-10-01T14:25:05 <Bosmon> But regardless of those, asynchronous resolution is pretty inconvenient for us
2014-10-01T14:25:22 <Bosmon> Because of our requirement in Kettle to have "callback wrappers" that propagate the request\'s identity from stack to stack
2014-10-01T14:25:44 <Bosmon> The fewer points there are of "unnecessary asynchrony", the easier this is
2014-10-01T14:26:08 <Bosmon> Ideally we should be able to locate absolutely every point in a design where any I/O is done, and wrap this behind a DataSource API
2014-10-01T14:26:16 <Bosmon> And all the wrapping can be done as an implementation detail
2014-10-01T14:26:41 <Bosmon> If our promises library itself introduces new asynchrony into the system we need to somehow be able to locate every use of it in order to inject the wrappers there

2014-10-01T14:49:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that was a long thread... and i see your point.. i would imagine that could add up to a big performance hit too
2014-10-01T14:49:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it could do, at least in older browsers
2014-10-01T14:50:07 <Bosmon> More modern environmens all have a performant means of scheduling a callback "at the next turn"
2014-10-01T14:50:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s good.. so for our new modern browsers only support we should be fine
