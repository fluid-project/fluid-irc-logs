2014-04-07T12:41:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for sending the question about the bitwise operator to the list. Do you have any more feedback on that pull request, any changes i could make in the meantime? I\'ll be away all of next week, so hope to get this one all wrapped up this week if possible.

2014-04-07T14:48:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks.. also i found another problem with FLUID-5298. I left a comment on the pull request about it.
2014-04-07T14:48:21 <Bosmon7> Thanks, I\'m looking at it now

2014-04-07T19:06:46 <Justin_o> sorry.. i was away from my machine for a while
2014-04-07T19:07:39 <karan10> Justin_o: It\'s ok, I updated my proposal "Picture Dictionary" on google-melange.
2014-04-07T19:08:34 <Justin_o> thanks. I took a quick look at it.. the update was about using jQuery and you provided the jsfiddle example. Did i miss anything else?

2014-04-07T19:10:20 <karan10> Justin_o: sorry ?
2014-04-07T19:11:59 <karan10> Justin_o: I want to discuss with you how we can check the image  displayed is correct or not?, What should be the approach for it ?
2014-04-07T19:12:07 <Justin_o> karan10: i just wanted to review what changes you made to your proposal.
2014-04-07T19:12:33 <Justin_o> karan10: hmm.. that\'s a good question
2014-04-07T19:12:44 <Justin_o> karan10: you mean you ask for a "lion" and get a tiger instead?
2014-04-07T19:14:14 <karan10> Justin_o: yes, also in case of "apple", the dictionary may  fetch images of "apple company" instead of  fruit.
2014-04-07T19:14:41 <karan10> how can we solve this issue ?
2014-04-07T19:15:55 <Justin_o> karan10: hmm.. vjoanna might have some ideas on this, but appears to not be around today. I would imagine that it would work something like a standard dictionary for this case and provide alternatives.
2014-04-07T19:16:43 <Justin_o> karan10: so for example the word "tear"
