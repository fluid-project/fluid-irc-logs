b'2014-03-05T21:14:54 <Bosmon> Yes well, I looked at them too
2014-03-05T21:15:06 <Bosmon> I guess I can hardly point any fingers given I have barely started documenting the new ChangeApplier
2014-03-05T21:15:37 <cindyli1> lol
2014-03-05T21:30:48 <simonjb> colinclark, Bosmon: just pushed my start on the debugger https://github.com/simonbates/infusion/commit/802fc8559824ba7b81c3cfecf3a2272d897e430e
2014-03-05T21:31:19 <colinclark> ooh awesome
2014-03-05T21:31:27 <Bosmon> Fascinating and fantastic, simonjb : P
2014-03-05T21:31:36 <simonjb> it\'s _very_ basic
2014-03-05T21:32:07 <simonjb> adds a link to the page that when clicked dumps the activityTrace
2014-03-05T21:32:36 <simonjb> the dump has activities indented by spaces
2014-03-05T21:32:41 <Bosmon> The code in your "buildSummary" function looks a little familiar : P
2014-03-05T21:32:46 <simonjb> to indicate the push/pop level
2014-03-05T21:33:29 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, basically a copy of fluid.stringTemplate
2014-03-05T21:33:43 <simonjb> with special casing for functions
2014-03-05T21:34:01 <colinclark> If you feel like it, I don\'t see any reason why it couldn\'t be factored as a View component
2014-03-05T21:34:55 <Bosmon> I think you could revert to just the standard fluid.stringTemplate by just preprocessing the "args" entry before it is sent in
2014-03-05T21:35:17 <simonjb> yeah, I wanted to discuss that; I can also see an argument for having the debugger separate from the fluid IoC machinery
2014-03-05T21:35:17 <colinclark> would it make sense to build up a model-like structure from an activity log in preparation for presentation, or to adjust the activity log prior to rendering it?
2014-03-05T21:35:41 <Bosmon> I think it will inevitable that the debugger becomes tightly coupled to the Fluid IoC machinery....
2014-03-05T21:35:58 <colinclark> inevitable how?
2014-03-05T21:36:07 <Bosmon> For the kinds of reasons we had chatted about - for example, its requirement in the end to perform "simulation" of various pieces of configuration
2014-03-05T21:36:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, I mean perhaps not be a user of it
2014-03-05T21:36:14 * cindyli1 has quit
2014-03-05T21:36:59 <Bosmon> Well, I think we will have to sort out its intimately being a user of it too - since very quickly we will run into questions that the debugger is unable to answer without submitting them to IoC resolution on its own bat
2014-03-05T21:37:24 <Bosmon> For example, "what subcomponents might this component have, that has not yet been instantiated"
2014-03-05T21:38:52 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, I agree there also; by "user" I want to say not have debugger construction code complicating the activity log of the users page -- be an observer, not what is being observed
2014-03-05T21:39:01 <Bosmon> Yes, that\'s certainly a danger
2014-03-05T21:39:12 <simonjb> but I think how the debugger integrates is a conversation we want to have
2014-03-05T21:39:19 <Bosmon> We will need to make our facilities for controlling the tracing much more robust
2014-03-05T21:39:39 <Bosmon> For example, for fluid logging we operate a "stacking" system whereby logging states get pushed and popped from a stack
2014-03-05T21:39:48 <Bosmon> And we presumably want the same for tracing states too
2014-03-05T21:39:59 * jhung has quit
2014-03-05T21:40:08 <Bosmon> Well
2014-03-05T21:40:14 <Bosmon> We probably need something even better than a stack
2014-03-05T21:40:39 <Bosmon> Especially once the framework becomes more asynchronous, it will become harder and harder for the debugger to guard its own stack frames
2014-03-05T21:40:47 <Bosmon> So what we probably want is "per-tree" tracing configuration
2014-03-05T21:40:57 <simonjb> Bosmon: and regarding reusing fluid.stringTemplate and preprocessing -- definitely another good option -- I did think of doing that and might go that route; I wanted to see what doing it myself would look like and see if there was value
2014-03-05T21:41:03 <Bosmon> simonjb - cool
2014-03-05T21:41:25 <Bosmon> So, for example, we would be able to turn off tracing for all materials related to the debugger\'s own tree of IoC components
2014-03-05T21:42:57 <Bosmon> I guess for the time being we could get away with a stack-based system
2014-03-05T21:43:08 <Bosmon> Assuming there won\'t be much dynamism in the debugger to start with
2014-03-05T21:43:10 <simonjb> Bosmon: certainly something like that would make it easier to make the debugger a fluid component and get all of the good stuff that entails -- I\'d like to keep the debugger out of what the user sees in the trace
2014-03-05T21:43:34 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, that\'s certainly essential
2014-03-05T21:45:54 <Bosmon> Perhaps the most straightforward and "reasonably robust" solution might be to apply a special grade name to the root of the debugger\'s own component tree
2014-03-05T21:45:58 <Bosmon> "fluid.noTracing" or so
2014-03-05T21:46:23 <Bosmon> And then to make a utility which checks this from every call site - naturally we\'d do the cheap test first to avoid slowing things down horribly
2014-03-05T21:46:54 <simonjb> Bosmon: that sounds very reasonable; is there any tracing that would happen before "fluid.noTracing" could be detected?
2014-03-05T21:47:19 <Bosmon> simonjb - well, we\'d put the check at every call site - since I believe every call site will have access to a "that" of some kind
2014-03-05T21:47:27 <Bosmon> Although it will be interesting to see if there are any exceptions
2014-03-05T21:48:51 <Bosmon> simonjb - I don\'t see any such sites on a quick scan of FluidIoC.js
2014-03-05T21:49:03 <Bosmon> Although I notice that resolveContextValue doesn\'t seem to have a "that" propagated into it in any visible way
2014-03-05T21:50:51 <Bosmon> "expandSource" is another one - but both of these in real fact will always have a "that" close at hand
2014-03-05T21:51:32 <Bosmon> So I think "morally", yes, we will always be able to guard each tracing site in this way
2014-03-05T21:51:41 <Bosmon> With doing only minor violence to the signatures in the framework : P
2014-03-05T21:53:58 <simonjb> cool
2014-03-05T21:54:23 <Bosmon> The tracing log is a log of IoC-mediated activities after all
2014-03-05T21:54:35 <Bosmon> So it stands to reason we should be able to assign a well-defined IoC location to each one
2014-03-05T21:54:47 <Bosmon> In fact this would only improve the relevance and consistency of the logs
2014-03-05T21:54:57 <Bosmon> That is, the local "that" is something that each logging record should get for free
2014-03-05T21:56:18 <simonjb> if I\'m understanding: add "that" to each tracing activity object in the activityTrace?
2014-03-05T21:56:42 <Bosmon> yes
2014-03-05T21:58:56 <simonjb> are any of those objects temporary? any concerns about holding references to objects that could cause them not to be collected?
2014-03-05T21:59:24 <simonjb> I know this would only be while tracing is enabled
2014-03-05T21:59:37 <simonjb> but good to have an idea
2014-03-05T22:00:50 <simonjb> there are quite a number of tracing events generated
2014-03-05T22:01:21 <simonjb> for the uiOptions demo page ~ 9000
2014-03-05T22:01:41 <simonjb> that includes pops
2014-03-05T22:04:25 * sgithens has quit
2014-03-05T22:04:49 * anvk has quit
2014-03-05T22:06:54 <Bosmon> simonjb - holding on to references is a concern, yes
2014-03-05T22:07:02 <Bosmon> And I guess of a piece with serialisation concerns in general
2014-03-05T22:07:17 * clown has left the channel
2014-03-05T22:08:33 <Bosmon> That is, we would like to be able to send these records to disk whilst reducing their value as little as possible
2014-03-05T22:08:44 <Bosmon> But that\'s sort of the same issue as to what extent they hold on to live object references
2014-03-05T22:09:05 <Bosmon> I imagine we could support both models to some extent
2014-03-05T22:09:23 <Bosmon> Even a destroyed component might in some situations hold some information valuable for debugging
2014-03-05T22:09:50 <Bosmon> But holding on to all of them as a set policy would be hazardous in general
2014-03-05T22:10:04 <simonjb> Bosmon: agreed
2014-03-05T22:10:27 <simonjb> ok, stuff to figure out but good to make a start
2014-03-05T22:10:39 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, it is great that all these issues are even surfacing
2014-03-05T22:10:51 <Bosmon> Since they were clearly "immediately latent" the moment any serious work began to be done on our tooling : P
2014-03-05T22:11:14 <simonjb> :)
2014-03-05T22:12:51 <simonjb> tomorrow, I will start a wiki page and get these things written down
2014-03-05T22:13:58 <Bosmon> simonjb - that will be completely fantastic
2014-03-05T22:14:25 <simonjb> Bosmon: thanks for all your help these past few days
2014-03-05T22:15:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - but thanks for YOUR help :)
2014-03-05T22:15:53 <colinclark> I\'m going to hit the road now too
2014-03-05T22:15:57 <colinclark> but I enjoyed reading this conversation
2014-03-05T22:16:03 <colinclark> and am excited about your progress, simonjb
2014-03-05T22:17:24 <simonjb> thanks colinclark; early days but good to have something concrete to help us see where we need further work within the core system in addition to the debugger ui itself

2014-03-05T21:00:19 <cindyli1> hi Bosmon
2014-03-05T21:02:56 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli1!
2014-03-05T21:03:43 <cindyli1> thanks for fixing 5282. it works great, so far ;) i have another question about model transformation, Bosmon
2014-03-05T21:04:00 <cindyli1> here\'s my use case: i have a central model looks like:
2014-03-05T21:04:05 <cindyli1> model: {
2014-03-05T21:04:05 <cindyli1> features: ["highContrast", "signLanguage", "captions"]
2014-03-05T21:04:05 <cindyli1> }
2014-03-05T21:04:19 <cindyli1> it needs to be relayed and transformed to three models:
2014-03-05T21:04:29 <cindyli1> model1: {
2014-03-05T21:04:29 <cindyli1> highContrast: true (or false)
2014-03-05T21:04:29 <cindyli1> }

2014-03-05T21:05:38 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - and I assume these separated models are in different components
2014-03-05T21:05:41 <cindyli1> the values of true or false in transformed three models depend on the presence of the corresponding keyword in the array
2014-03-05T21:05:49 <Bosmon> My suggestion for this is to do the transform in two stages
2014-03-05T21:05:55 <cindyli1> exactly, for different components
2014-03-05T21:06:13 <Bosmon> Firstly, transform the model to an "intermediate model" attached to the same component using our existing arrayToBoolean transformer or whatever the damn thing is called
2014-03-05T21:06:26 <Bosmon> And then link to the separate models via simple references to the intermediate model
2014-03-05T21:07:20 <Bosmon> For example model3: { captions: "{rootModel}.model.featureBooleans.captions" } or so

2014-03-05T21:09:34 <cindyli1> umm\xe2\x80\xa6 the first stage to transform in the same model still map btw the similar structures. why do we need that stage, Bosmon?
2014-03-05T21:11:34 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - because it is more sensible to make use of the transforms we have already, rather than design some strange customised thing that both maps to booleans and then separates into different models in a single step
2014-03-05T21:12:19 <Bosmon> It looks like the transform "arrayToSetMembership" is the one you want
2014-03-05T21:12:25 <Bosmon> unfortunately our documentation for this is dreadful
2014-03-05T21:12:31 <Bosmon> And KASPARNET has gone to bed already : P

2014-03-05T21:13:40 <cindyli1> ok, i see ur point. don\'t worry about the documentation. we have unit tests which are same helpful :)
