b'2014-09-25T14:12:41 <Bosmon> Are there other types of user "opinion"?
2014-09-25T14:12:57 <Justin_o> my line 149 looks like opinion: []   // Possible values: like, dislike
2014-09-25T14:13:01 <Bosmon> There is the "opinion" field which is an array which it seems could include "like" and "dislike"
2014-09-25T14:13:01 <Bosmon> yes
2014-09-25T14:13:08 <Justin_o> oh
2014-09-25T14:13:23 <Justin_o> i guess the comment should be // Possible values: like or dislike
2014-09-25T14:13:25 <Justin_o> would that be better
2014-09-25T14:13:45 <Justin_o> it could only be one of them though, but i believe we need the array for the arrayToSetMembership transformation we are using
2014-09-25T14:14:04 <Bosmon> Well yes, but what does the transformation achieve?
2014-09-25T14:14:20 <Bosmon> Presumably the transformation only exists because the model value "opinion" is useful somehow
2014-09-25T14:14:37 <Bosmon> I guess it is the one which ends up in persistence
2014-09-25T14:15:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the model will look something like this
2014-09-25T14:15:37 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/GB8GELsh
2014-09-25T14:16:04 <Justin_o> so the transformation is used to set the match and mismatch values in one change
2014-09-25T14:16:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - so what is the array version of the value used for?
2014-09-25T14:17:39 <Justin_o> it\'s just used as an intermediary value to be transformed via the arrayToSetMembership transform
2014-09-25T14:18:01 <Bosmon> Well, we seem to be going around in circles :)
2014-09-25T14:18:08 <Bosmon> I can ask again what the transform is used for : P
2014-09-25T14:18:43 <Justin_o> in the broad sense it allows us to go from {match}.model.isActive = true   to  {feedback}.model.opinion = {match: true, mismatch: false} in a single atomic action so we only get one model change event fired for setting the two opinion values
2014-09-25T14:18:52 <Bosmon> Clearly both the transform and the array value entail each other\'s existence - the question is, why are either of them there? : P
2014-09-25T14:18:53 <Justin_o> did that make sense
2014-09-25T14:19:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o- you could achieve that by simply applying a change holding {match: true, mismatch: false}
2014-09-25T14:19:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that case is easy, it\'s the other that is hard.. when {match}.model.isActive is changed to false
2014-09-25T14:19:54 <Bosmon> ok
2014-09-25T14:20:04 <Bosmon> I see
2014-09-25T14:20:16 <Bosmon> We should probably have some comments explaining this by the modelRelay block
2014-09-25T14:20:17 <Justin_o> we don\'t know what state the mismatch should be in, but maybe i\'m confusing myself
2014-09-25T14:20:44 <Bosmon> That is, that the purpose of the array value is to obtain mutual exclusion between the "match" and "mismatch" values
2014-09-25T14:20:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: makes sense.. would it be useful for me to restate the whole model communication that we need, perhaps you could think of a simpler solution.
2014-09-25T14:21:09 <Bosmon> Ok, so I\'ve determined that the real applier id we are interested in is "-513"
2014-09-25T14:21:20 <Bosmon> This is the applier id attached to the "match" button
2014-09-25T14:21:55 * clown joined the channel
2014-09-25T14:22:44 <Justin_o> hmm, mine didn\'t fire
2014-09-25T14:22:56 <Justin_o> i\'ll run it again and see if it comes back
2014-09-25T14:24:36 * simonjb has quit
2014-09-25T14:24:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: my 513 applier is not fired, at least when the problem occurs
2014-09-25T14:25:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: actually i don\'t seem to see it at all.. is the number correct?
2014-09-25T14:25:55 <Justin_o> i get 512
2014-09-25T14:26:13 <Bosmon> Hmm
2014-09-25T14:26:26 <Bosmon> I can\'t imagine that putting in some logging has disturbed the applier number
2014-09-25T14:26:30 <Bosmon> FOr me it is 513
2014-09-25T14:26:39 <Bosmon> And I see the "isActive" change setting to true
2014-09-25T14:26:48 <Justin_o> i commented out the second place you mentioned to put a comment, did i need to put that back in
2014-09-25T14:26:50 <Bosmon> And now I see what appears to be the wrong value coming out of the relay
2014-09-25T14:27:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah so that could be the problem
2014-09-25T14:27:24 <Bosmon> The value output from the relay holds {match: false, mismatch: false}
2014-09-25T14:28:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: anyways to restate what should happen with the relays..  match isActive: true -> {match: true, mismatch: false} ,   mismatch isActive: true -> {match: false, mismatch true}... mismatch and match isActive false should ensure that only it\'s corresponding value is false and not change the other
2014-09-25T14:29:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :(
2014-09-25T14:29:17 <Justin_o> so maybe the relay isn\'t correct

2014-09-25T14:32:06 <jhung> anastasiac: I have pushed changes to my FLUID-5451 branch. Pull it down and let me what you think of the changes.
2014-09-25T14:33:42 * slim joined the channel
2014-09-25T14:36:20 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - ok, so it appears there is a bug in the relay system
2014-09-25T14:36:31 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I don\'t have time to debug it this week
2014-09-25T14:36:51 <Bosmon> But we can write up a JIRA and perhaps take a fresh branch of this branch state so we don\'t lose it
2014-09-25T14:37:32 <Bosmon> What I suggest you do is to remove the model relay and "inTransit" field, and replace it with a set of standard modelListeners written in code
2014-09-25T14:37:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  so that part is already there in master.. at least
2014-09-25T14:37:55 <Bosmon> I guess this will unfortunately be rather similar to what you had written before you put in the relay :(
2014-09-25T14:37:56 <Bosmon> Right
2014-09-25T14:38:00 <Bosmon> ok
2014-09-25T14:38:51 <Justin_o> that\'s alright at least we have a working version
2014-09-25T14:39:05 <Justin_o> i can keep this branch in my repo though if it\'s helpful for you
2014-09-25T14:40:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon, anastasiac: where are the docs for kettle i remember we had written something up at a community meeting
2014-09-25T14:40:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon, anastasiac: is this it http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+on+Kettle
2014-09-25T14:43:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve written up http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5517
2014-09-25T14:44:06 <Bosmon> Could you branch the current state of your repo with a branch named after this JIRA?
2014-09-25T14:44:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - these aren\'t our docs for Kettle, no
2014-09-25T14:44:37 <Bosmon> At least, I\'d certainly hope not : P
2014-09-25T14:44:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do we have anything better :)
2014-09-25T14:45:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: alex is going to start looking into using kettle to serve PCP
2014-09-25T14:45:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - all I can find is the link leading from our main Kettle page
2014-09-25T14:45:27 <Bosmon> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Kettle
2014-09-25T14:45:35 <Bosmon> points to: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Configuration
2014-09-25T14:46:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-09-25T14:46:24 <Justin_o> i sent those links along too
2014-09-25T14:48:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way i added a link to my branch on FLUID-5517
2014-09-25T14:56:24 * michelled has quit
2014-09-25T14:57:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks - could you create a branch named FLUID-5517 in your repo from your FLOE-230 and link to that instead?
2014-09-25T14:58:11 <Bosmon> That way we can be sure that we can link to a fixed snapshot

2014-09-25T10:57:36 <slim> A quick Q as I\'m transfering some project time allocation for the liteners
2014-09-25T10:58:12 <slim> do you thin it fits best in 105.1 Global architecture framework
2014-09-25T10:58:28 <slim> or 105.4 Architectures\xe2\x80\x99auto-configuration and innovation mechanisms
2014-09-25T10:58:39 <slim> Or doesn\'t it really mater?
2014-09-25T11:00:49 <kasparnet> slim: It could go in either -- perhaps it makes most sense to move time to A105.1 as that will allow you more flexibility if some of the work goes beyond A105.4 stuff
2014-09-25T11:01:15 <slim> kasparnet:  great minds! I\'ll do that.
2014-09-25T11:01:24 <kasparnet> awesome!

2014-09-25T13:01:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello
2014-09-25T13:01:58 <Justin_o> i ran into another confusing issue that you might have some thoughts on
2014-09-25T13:02:21 <Justin_o> basically i was working on FLOE-230 http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-230
2014-09-25T13:02:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: we were able to implement a model relay, however, now one of the change applier events fires but does nothing
2014-09-25T13:03:06 * jessm joined the channel
2014-09-25T13:03:13 <Justin_o> none of the attached listeners ever get fired, although the change applier call is called
2014-09-25T13:03:33 <Justin_o> and this only happens when you click on the match button when the mismatch dialog is open. everything else works properly
2014-09-25T13:03:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: any ideas?

2014-09-25T13:20:58 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o - does the model actually change?
2014-09-25T13:30:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hmm.. let me check again
2014-09-25T13:31:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: no the model value doesn\'t change
2014-09-25T13:32:30 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - in that case you will get no notification
2014-09-25T13:32:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: let me restate that
2014-09-25T13:32:42 <Bosmon7> The new ChangeApplier doesn\'t fire any listeners if a change has no effect on the model
2014-09-25T13:32:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon7:  the model value should have changed, but didn\'t
2014-09-25T13:32:56 * clown joined the channel
2014-09-25T13:32:57 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-09-25T13:33:00 <Bosmon7> What change did you fire?
2014-09-25T13:33:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the call looks like this
2014-09-25T13:33:02 <Justin_o> that.applier.change("isActive", !that.model.isActive);
2014-09-25T13:33:09 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-09-25T13:33:29 * clown has left the channel
2014-09-25T13:33:33 <Bosmon7> Is the value of !that.model.isActive what you expect, at the time of the call?
2014-09-25T13:33:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes
2014-09-25T13:34:58 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-09-25T13:35:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i have pushed my branch up if it would be easier to try https://github.com/jobara/metadata/tree/FLOE-230
2014-09-25T13:35:08 <Bosmon7> Could you check it into a branch, and give me some instructions to reproduce it?
2014-09-25T13:35:10 <Bosmon7> Thanks
2014-09-25T13:35:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the problem seems to be arising from this line https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-230/src/components/feedback/js/bindDialog.js#L308
2014-09-25T13:36:11 <Justin_o> to reproduce you can just load up the feedback demo
2014-09-25T13:36:23 <Justin_o> click on the sad face, after the dialog is open, click on the happy face
2014-09-25T13:36:46 <Justin_o> you\'ll see that the mismatch (sad face) dialog closes, but the match (happy face) doesn\'t open.
2014-09-25T13:36:57 <Justin_o> if you do this in the other order, happy first then sad, it works properly
2014-09-25T13:37:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: also if you run the feedback tests. i believe the failures are related to this problem

2014-09-25T13:48:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a shorthand to bind the same function and list of arguments to multiple methods (click, keypress, etc.)?
2014-09-25T13:48:38 <the-t-in-rtf> s/function/listener/
2014-09-25T13:51:02 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o - the reason for the failed change appears to be an immediately following change being emitted from gpii.queuedDataSource.start
2014-09-25T13:51:36 <Bosmon7> Immediately after the user triggers the change to set the button to be active, it appears that an change holding the opposite value is emitted from the dataSource
2014-09-25T13:52:01 <Bosmon7> As a hint for debugging, you can place the following code at line 23684 of infusion-custom.js:
2014-09-25T13:52:11 <Bosmon> console.log("Firing user change ", changeRequest, " to applier ", that);
2014-09-25T13:52:11 <Bosmon> console.log("Stack: " + new Error().stack);
2014-09-25T13:52:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks... that\'s helpful.
2014-09-25T13:52:39 <Bosmon> Given that the ChangeApplier is now firing all the time for hover events, this is the only practical sort of way of getting a handle on what is going on
2014-09-25T13:52:57 <Bosmon> Given that setting breakpoints isn\'t really practical with such a high rate of chang efiring
2014-09-25T13:53:12 <Bosmon> One day, of course, we will have debugging tools that allow us to instrument these :)
2014-09-25T13:53:41 <Bosmon> But I have been having a long week sticking logging statements inside framework code, so I may as well share this useful technique
2014-09-25T13:54:05 <Bosmon> Another useful site is at line 23068
2014-09-25T13:54:11 <Bosmon> Inside "fluid.model.notifyExternal"
2014-09-25T13:54:21 <Bosmon> At this point I have
2014-09-25T13:54:22 <Bosmon> console.log("Notifying change ", change.args, " to listener ", change.listener);
2014-09-25T13:57:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks for the tips. I\'ve added in those console logs and will try again to see how it looks.
2014-09-25T13:58:04 * jessm has quit
2014-09-25T13:58:57 <Justin_o> these hover events make for a lot of logs though :(
2014-09-25T14:00:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - they do
2014-09-25T14:00:37 <Bosmon> It\'s helpful to do a "clear" in the Firebug UI just before you trigger the crucial change : P
2014-09-25T14:01:28 <Bosmon> Then you\'ll only get one extra piece of noise from a "hover" to look at ....
2014-09-25T14:01:35 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: you could make an invoker and pass this around to the other methods. or you could construct a function that binds the function to the multiple methods
2014-09-25T14:01:42 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: Bosmon might have some more ideas
2014-09-25T14:02:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - as far as I can see, the applier you are interested in is the one with id ending "-470"
2014-09-25T14:02:09 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-09-25T14:02:15 <Bosmon> You can expect these ids to remain consistent between runs
2014-09-25T14:02:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh thanks.. i wasn\'t even looking at that one
2014-09-25T14:02:56 <Bosmon> If you want more certainty, you can write "onCreate" code in your components which sticks an extra name onto the applier so you can identify it more clearly
2014-09-25T14:03:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - here\'s what seemed to be the crucial change as far as I could see:
2014-09-25T14:04:00 <Bosmon> Firing user change Object { path="isActive", value=false, type="ADD", more...} to applier Object { applierId="18cflyk1-470", holder={...}, changeListeners={...}, more...}

2014-09-25T14:04:40 <Bosmon> I believe it is the one setting the state of the clicked button back to "false" although I could have mixed the appliers up
2014-09-25T14:05:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @Justin_o.  I was hoping for a "methods" alternate to bind to an array of event types.  I only have two methods at this point (click and keypress), so I may hold off for now.
2014-09-25T14:05:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was looking at the spot in the code that you mentioned earlier
2014-09-25T14:05:32 <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-230/src/components/pouchDBDataSource/js/pouchDBDataSource.js#L78
2014-09-25T14:06:13 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2014-09-25T14:06:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: however this should only be setting the isActive state of the datasource queue not of the button, unless something horrible has gone wrong :(
2014-09-25T14:06:31 * jessm joined the channel
2014-09-25T14:06:32 <Bosmon> Perhaps I mixed them up in that case
2014-09-25T14:06:37 <Bosmon> We certainly do have a lot of applier stuff going on now
2014-09-25T14:08:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there is, and there\'s a lot of model relays in there now too
2014-09-25T14:08:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i should note that this was working before we introduced the new model relay between the isActive state of the match and mismatch dialogs with the model in the parent component
2014-09-25T14:08:55 <Bosmon> I see
2014-09-25T14:09:30 <Bosmon> The "inTransit" name is rather unclear
2014-09-25T14:10:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess we could rename that to something more appropriate
2014-09-25T14:10:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: suggestions are welcome..
2014-09-25T14:10:31 <Bosmon> I\'m wondering what the strategy is behind the use of the empty string in the rule?
2014-09-25T14:10:35 <Bosmon> I see options: {
2014-09-25T14:10:39 <Bosmon> dislike: ""
2014-09-25T14:10:41 <Bosmon> }
2014-09-25T14:11:00 <Justin_o> it\'s because it\'s pointing at the root of the model path it has
2014-09-25T14:11:09 <Bosmon> ok
2014-09-25T14:11:35 <Justin_o> since we have the target as "{that}.model.isActive"
2014-09-25T14:11:39 <Justin_o> and want to change this propery
2014-09-25T14:11:42 <Justin_o> property
2014-09-25T14:11:45 <Bosmon> Is it ever possible for the "like" and "dislike" buttons to be active at the same time?
2014-09-25T14:11:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no they shouldn\'t
2014-09-25T14:11:57 <Bosmon> ok
2014-09-25T14:12:13 <Justin_o> only one or none of them should be set to true at any time
2014-09-25T14:12:15 <Bosmon> Why is there an array value containing them encoded at line 149 of feedback.js?
2014-09-25T14:12:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there?
