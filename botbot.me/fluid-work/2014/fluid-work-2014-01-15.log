b'2014-01-15T17:48:09 <colinclark> right
2014-01-15T17:48:18 <michelled> I figure that once kasper has returned, we will send another pull request e-mail to the list
2014-01-15T17:48:23 <colinclark> I guess we have to figure out what to do with various application-specific preference sets
2014-01-15T17:48:27 <colinclark> and the like
2014-01-15T17:48:31 <michelled> then after that, we\'ll start the pilot 2 lists
2014-01-15T17:48:47 <colinclark> my impression is that now might be the time to chip away at a bit of infrastructure to make it possible to easily change between preference set folders
2014-01-15T17:50:40 <michelled> folders? or repos?
2014-01-15T17:52:50 <colinclark> i don\'t know
2014-01-15T17:53:00 <colinclark> I guess we could come up with some kind of repository overlay process
2014-01-15T17:53:09 <colinclark> but then we definitely need Grunt tooling
2014-01-15T17:53:15 <colinclark> because npm alone won\'t cut it
2014-01-15T17:53:25 <Bosmon> Hey colinclark - congrats on an excellent presentation last night :)
2014-01-15T17:53:46 <colinclark> alternatively, we put all the stuff in the main repository and make it easier to configure the system to use/not use various sets and installed solutions
2014-01-15T17:53:55 <colinclark> Bosmon: Thanks! It was great to have your company for it
2014-01-15T17:54:29 <colinclark> I will endeavour to get these logs into a form where they can be included in the master repository, since I think they\'re pretty helpful
2014-01-15T17:54:43 <michelled> Bosmon: were you also skyped into the meetings?
2014-01-15T17:54:53 <colinclark> There was a flaky gotomeeting connection
2014-01-15T17:55:08 <Bosmon> michelled - I got the gotomeeting experience, which was pretty abominable
2014-01-15T17:55:16 <Bosmon> But I got to hear maybe 70% of what colinclark said : P
2014-01-15T17:55:36 <michelled> nice
2014-01-15T17:56:16 <colinclark> It\'s just so incredible to think about where we were at, this time on Saturday
2014-01-15T17:56:27 <colinclark> so, what, five days ago?
2014-01-15T17:56:40 <colinclark> this time last Saturday, NOTHING was working
2014-01-15T17:57:34 <michelled> well, 2 of the 5 demos were working with the old matchmaker
2014-01-15T17:57:47 <colinclark> today, you mean?
2014-01-15T17:57:54 <michelled> no, last Saturday
2014-01-15T17:57:57 <colinclark> ah
2014-01-15T17:58:04 <colinclark> fair enough
2014-01-15T17:58:12 <michelled> I believe all 5 demos with *both* STMM and RBMM worked today
2014-01-15T17:58:24 <michelled> but I didn\'t ask specifically about PCP/PMT
2014-01-15T17:58:24 <colinclark> I\'m really looking forward to getting the Canopy Matchmaker to the point where it can be the default Matchmaker
2014-01-15T17:58:36 <colinclark> it is so smart and compact, that one
2014-01-15T17:58:49 <colinclark> Yes, I\'d like to see the PCP and PMT msyelf
2014-01-15T17:59:12 <colinclark> danaayotte: Were you or vjoanna able to see the PCP/PMT in action during the craziness over the past few days?
2014-01-15T17:59:51 <danaayotte> no, not me.
2014-01-15T17:59:56 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 that reminds me - I\'m sure people will want to know what to work on at tomorrow\'s meeting :)
2014-01-15T18:00:04 <michelled> thank goodness for JIRA ...
2014-01-15T18:00:46 <Bosmon> FORREST CANNOPY!.... underneath which is harboured.... FORREST.CATT

2014-01-15T00:01:36 <kasparnet> hehe
2014-01-15T00:02:28 <kasparnet> I\'m glad they dont have a limit to awesome in IRC, else we\'d both get kicked off right now
2014-01-15T00:07:48 <kasparnet> avtar: ok - so we\'ve just gone through the demos and everything worked!!!!
2014-01-15T00:07:52 <kasparnet> so exciting

2014-01-15T00:09:29 <kasparnet> thanks avtar!!
2014-01-15T00:09:41 <kasparnet> talk to you in the morning
2014-01-15T00:10:47 <Bosmon> We might have to restart the DAMNNING soon if KASPARNETT keeps on merging his own pull requests : P
2014-01-15T00:11:24 <kasparnet> Bosmon: at least this time it wasn\'t into master
2014-01-15T00:11:34 <kasparnet> :)
2014-01-15T00:11:35 <avtar> kasparnet: large bills, please
2014-01-15T00:11:40 <avtar> or bitcoins
2014-01-15T00:11:43 <kasparnet> (or at least I hope not)
2014-01-15T00:11:56 <kasparnet> avtar: It\'ll be large bills - OG style
2014-01-15T00:12:24 <avtar> kasparnet: are we still on for 2:00?
2014-01-15T00:13:55 <kasparnet> avtar: yes! We\'ll try to verify the connection and do a test for each of stmm/rbmm/flomwmanager as early as possible so you can get back to sleep
2014-01-15T00:17:28 <avtar> ok cool

2014-01-15T14:50:40 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i wonder if we should change from the fluid.metadata namespace to just metadata or md or something like that

2014-01-15T14:55:17 * kasparnet has quit

2014-01-15T15:34:10 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m not sure. what namespace did you use for the prefs editors work?
2014-01-15T15:34:24 <Justin_o_> i think we used floe
2014-01-15T15:35:10 <Justin_o_> michelled: no.. we actually used gpii
2014-01-15T15:35:22 <michelled> perhaps you want to use that again?
2014-01-15T15:35:28 <Justin_o_> okay
2014-01-15T15:35:32 <michelled> Justin_o_: why don\'t you want to use fluid?
2014-01-15T15:36:51 <Justin_o_> michelled: 1) i was trying to shorten the length 2) i like to reserve that for core Infusion work 3) this goes along with 2, i\'m afraid it\'s too tied to the version number of Infusion and may be confusing as such.
2014-01-15T15:37:20 <Justin_o_> michelled: but this would go a long with the separation of concerns between what is infusion vs what is something else..
2014-01-15T15:37:38 <Justin_o_> it lives in a different repo, should be versioned separately and etc.
2014-01-15T15:38:44 <michelled> makes sense Justin_o_ I think the gpii namespace is appropriate
2014-01-15T15:38:53 <michelled> since this work is both gpii and floe
2014-01-15T15:39:14 <Justin_o_> michelled: okay
2014-01-15T15:39:21 <Justin_o_> thanks.. i\'ll file a jira about htat
2014-01-15T15:39:22 <Justin_o_> that
2014-01-15T15:39:39 <Justin_o_> michelled: we are doing the work in a floe jira space by the way
2014-01-15T15:40:34 <michelled> I think that\'s fine Justin_o_
2014-01-15T15:43:13 <Justin_o_> michelled: okay, thanks
2014-01-15T15:50:21 <Justin_o_> michelled, cindyli: i\'ve filed this new jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-160

2014-01-15T17:39:11 <colinclark> Did anyone hear a final report from kasparnet about the review demos? How did they go?
2014-01-15T17:39:29 <colinclark> The network connection was pretty flaky, so I was a bit worried there would be errors
2014-01-15T17:40:16 <michelled> colinclark: he said they went really well :)
2014-01-15T17:40:18 <colinclark> phew
2014-01-15T17:40:22 <colinclark> oh what a relief!
2014-01-15T17:40:33 <michelled> "everything worked perfect, except for Mobile Accessibility (that couldn\'t recieve the settings due to internet lost connection)"
2014-01-15T17:40:43 <colinclark> Well, thank you to everyone--you guys worked so hard to make it happen
2014-01-15T17:40:52 <michelled> kasparnet: and Colin\'s slow demo went really well also - despite some audio difficulties - and the reviewers said they really appreciated it
2014-01-15T17:40:52 <michelled> [10:05am] kasparnet: and no - no more demos now
2014-01-15T17:41:19 <colinclark> The network connectivity wasn\'t great, so I cut out a few times
2014-01-15T17:41:27 <colinclark> but Skype was remarkably good at immediately reconnecting
2014-01-15T17:41:33 <michelled> that\'s great
2014-01-15T17:41:35 <colinclark> and Kasper filled in the gaps excellently
2014-01-15T17:41:44 <michelled> :)
2014-01-15T17:41:56 <colinclark> It wasn\'t as good as my dress rehearsal because of the issues, and I couldn\'t really tell if the reviewers cared
2014-01-15T17:42:05 <colinclark> but it\'s good to hear that they commented positively about it
2014-01-15T17:42:38 <michelled> yes
2014-01-15T17:42:47 <colinclark> Thank you again, fluid-everyone, for all you hard work. It\'s really amazing.
2014-01-15T17:43:45 <danaayotte> +++++1
2014-01-15T17:46:40 <colinclark> michelled: So I guess our next step is to careful review the ironically-titled review2 branch and start getting the important commits into master?
2014-01-15T17:47:30 <michelled> yes, colinclark - I have documented most of the changes that weren\'t already in pull requests
2014-01-15T17:47:37 <colinclark> excellent
2014-01-15T17:47:40 <michelled> I need to do one more pass, but it should be too bad
2014-01-15T17:47:56 <michelled> so, colinclark the next step is actually getting those pull requests into master
