2014-11-24T15:34:37 <cindyli1> danaayotte: i\'m working on http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1014 to use text field stepper for adjusting cursor size. as you know, when the focus is on the "-" or "+" on the steppers, screen readers would announce "minus" or "plus". Bosmon2 or Bosmon7 suggests we probably should pick a more meaning words such as "smaller" and "larger". what do you think?
2014-11-24T15:36:12 <danaayotte> cindyli1, focus shouldn\'t land on the + and - buttons individually. It should land on the text field and arrow keys used to control value
2014-11-24T15:36:27 <danaayotte> can we label the text field to inform the user to use arrow keys?
2014-11-24T15:37:18 <danaayotte> cindyli1 that is what we intended with all of the +/- buttons, although I\'m not sure if that\'s how they are working right now
2014-11-24T15:37:32 * michelled joined the channel
2014-11-24T15:40:07 <cindyli1> danaayotte: just tried the stepper with voiceOver. it seems +/- are not focusable. the only focusable element for the stepper is the text field where users can change its value. arrow keys don\'t work in there yet.
2014-11-24T15:41:26 <cindyli1> danaayotte: i will try to improve the usability with arrow keys
2014-11-24T15:41:40 <danaayotte> great cindyli1!
2014-11-24T15:42:26 <cindyli1> seems the words for +/- are not actually used, unless I miss it, :) danaayotte and Bosmon2 or Bosmon7
2014-11-24T15:43:57 <danaayotte> how do you mean, cindyli1?
2014-11-24T15:48:41 <cindyli1> danaayotte: while i was tabbing around the stepper, the translations for +/-  were never announced. let me try making voiceOver read the context around the stepper
2014-11-24T15:50:02 * clown joined the channel
2014-11-24T15:52:16 <danaayotte> right, so I don\'t think "plus" or "minus" ever needs to be announced at all. "use the arrow keys to change the value" and then some feedback "up" and "down" or "larger" and "smaller" when the arrow keys are pressed would be best
2014-11-24T15:52:26 <danaayotte> cindyli1 ^
2014-11-24T15:52:58 <cindyli1> i see. thanks, danaayotte

2014-11-24T19:31:35 <cindyli> danaayotte: continuing with the words for + and - buttons. since they are buttons and need to have proper labels to be understandable. what words do you think we should use? currently we are using words "plus" and "minus". does it make more sense to use more meaningful words as Bosmon2 suggested, such as "smaller" and "larger"?
2014-11-24T19:33:11 <danaayotte> cindyli when would the button labels be read? when the user hits the arrow keys?
2014-11-24T19:33:28 <danaayotte> or only if user selects with mouse?
2014-11-24T19:34:41 <danaayotte> I think "larger" and "smaller" are best
2014-11-24T19:35:15 * clown_mtg has quit
2014-11-24T19:36:29 <cindyli> danaayotte: ok. when the user hits arrow keys, only the new value will be read without reading out button labels. however, screen readers provide some key combinations to look deep into DOM, so we need to label all UI elements properly.
2014-11-24T19:36:52 <jhung> michelled: would it be better if we met tomorrow for Floe meeting? I\'ll be in the office and I\'m leaving a little earlier today.
2014-11-24T19:36:54 <cindyli> danaayotte: should i also change labels for other steppers, such as for text size?
2014-11-24T19:37:04 <danaayotte> yes please cindyli!
2014-11-24T19:37:11 <cindyli> ok. thanks, danaayotte
