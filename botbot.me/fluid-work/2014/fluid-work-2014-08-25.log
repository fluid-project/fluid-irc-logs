2014-08-25T18:37:38 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2014-08-25T18:38:53 <cindyli> hey, Bosmon, i\'m in the middle of creating a unit test to demonstrate an issue with the model transformation. to check with you:
2014-08-25T18:38:55 <cindyli> http://pastie.org/9501724
2014-08-25T18:39:09 <cindyli> does this transformation ok to you?
2014-08-25T18:39:14 <cindyli> "look" ok
2014-08-25T18:39:44 <cindyli> but it seems valueMapper doesn\'t accept compound value for the output
2014-08-25T18:39:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - you should remember this issue from last time :)
2014-08-25T18:39:59 <cindyli> i receive empty objects in outputs
2014-08-25T18:40:05 <Bosmon> Don\'t you remember it?
2014-08-25T18:40:07 <Bosmon> We even have JIRAs : P
2014-08-25T18:40:16 <cindyli> what??? do we???
2014-08-25T18:40:29 <Bosmon> So, firstly, to make this set of rules work, you need to wrap the output in "literalValue"
2014-08-25T18:40:42 <Bosmon> You can compare this with your impl for the metadata component
2014-08-25T18:40:48 <Bosmon> Secondly, I don\'t think this use of valueMapper is necessary
2014-08-25T18:41:27 <Bosmon> i think you can do it all with a standard arrayToBooleans expander
2014-08-25T18:41:52 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-08-25T18:42:18 <Bosmon> To be sure, you can do it this way too
2014-08-25T18:44:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - here is the JIRA
2014-08-25T18:44:31 * clown_mtg has quit
2014-08-25T18:44:36 <Bosmon> Actually perhaps I misremember the context of this issue
2014-08-25T18:44:44 <Bosmon> And it was actually Justin_o who originally reported it, not you
2014-08-25T18:45:10 <Bosmon> It looks like in the metadata panel, you wrote the compound values at the input end, and not the output end
2014-08-25T18:45:17 <cindyli> yes
2014-08-25T18:45:28 <Bosmon> And so you didn\'t encounter this issue
2014-08-25T18:45:34 <cindyli> no
2014-08-25T18:45:50 <cindyli> did you find the jira related to the output compound?
2014-08-25T18:45:52 <Bosmon> But I think that the arrayToSetMembership transform should do everything you need here
2014-08-25T18:45:56 <Bosmon> oh sorry
2014-08-25T18:46:00 <Bosmon> I didn\'t paste the actual link!
2014-08-25T18:46:05 <Bosmon> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5250
2014-08-25T18:46:14 <Bosmon> That\'s the problem with doing things "in your mind"
2014-08-25T18:46:32 <Bosmon> This issue is also related: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5300
2014-08-25T18:47:00 <Bosmon> Anyway, the same issue applies to the "output value" of every transformer
2014-08-25T18:47:15 <Bosmon> Currently, by default, it is interpreted as a transformation map, rather than a literal object
2014-08-25T18:47:46 <cindyli> ok, adding a literalValue wrapper should solve the problem?
2014-08-25T18:47:51 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2014-08-25T18:48:01 <cindyli> and, can we use arrayToSetMembership?
2014-08-25T18:48:06 <Bosmon> cindyli yes, and yes
2014-08-25T18:48:07 <cindyli> 1. the input is not an array
2014-08-25T18:48:19 <cindyli> 2. the output is a compound value
2014-08-25T18:48:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can just wrap it in an array
2014-08-25T18:48:23 <Bosmon> a 1-element array
2014-08-25T18:48:34 <Bosmon> The output will just be a hash of boolean flags
2014-08-25T18:48:48 <Bosmon> Which is that natural output of arrayToSetMembership
2014-08-25T18:48:53 <Bosmon> So you can consider it "compound" at that level
2014-08-25T18:49:22 <Bosmon> You can continue with valueMapper + literalValue, or you can, I believe, just simplify it to a standard arrayToSetMembership with a 1-element array
2014-08-25T18:49:44 <cindyli> in the case of "none", we need to output {match: false, mismatch: false}
2014-08-25T18:49:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - my plan is that there will be a 3rd flag called "none"
2014-08-25T18:50:06 <Bosmon> So you will in fact output {match: false, mismatch: false, none: true}
2014-08-25T18:50:13 <Bosmon> And not use the 3rd flag for rendering
2014-08-25T18:50:26 <cindyli> ah, i see.
2014-08-25T18:50:42 <cindyli> how can you be so smart
2014-08-25T18:50:47 <cindyli> no fair
2014-08-25T18:50:54 <Bosmon> I hope it will not require smartness to operate this system!
2014-08-25T18:51:00 <Bosmon> It is intended to be natural and obvious : P
2014-08-25T18:51:08 <Bosmon> Hopefully over time it will start to seem that way ......
2014-08-25T18:51:10 <cindyli> sounds like i\'m too dumb ;(
2014-08-25T18:52:27 <Bosmon> To be sure, it took me half a day to understand how we can do this "easily" : P
2014-08-25T18:52:36 <Bosmon> But I think we will all get better with practice
2014-08-25T18:52:44 <cindyli> +1
2014-08-25T18:52:45 <Bosmon> And with an increasing gallery of successful examples
2014-08-25T18:53:18 <Bosmon> And, of course, in the end, a UI which constructs these transforms automatically, given a couple of examples :)
2014-08-25T18:53:45 <cindyli> sounds beautiful
2014-08-25T18:54:11 <Bosmon> Given everything has a declarative form, these examples will be easy to index and regenerate
2014-08-25T18:54:41 <Bosmon> I did actually have a crisis on Friday when I thought that it might be impossible to deal with this simple example in our system : P
2014-08-25T18:55:05 <Bosmon> But it\'s interesting how simply choosing an "appropriate form" for a model makes seemingly intractible problems just go away
2014-08-25T18:55:05 <cindyli> fortunately, you figured out \xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2014-08-25T18:55:25 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s promising that the system is more powerful than we realise : P
2014-08-25T18:55:59 <Bosmon> It\'s a sure sign of a system that has some legs to it that it can do things which you thought were impossible at the outset

2014-08-25T12:54:24 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon. Justin_o is away from his desk. maybe once he comes back ...
2014-08-25T12:54:39 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-25T12:54:50 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I have a security meeting in about 5 mins so it will probably have to be later
2014-08-25T12:55:02 * jessm joined the channel
2014-08-25T12:55:04 <Bosmon> But I was just wanting to check we were on track and doing ok :)
2014-08-25T12:55:13 <Bosmon> perhaps we can do it at 10 EDT
2014-08-25T12:55:27 <Bosmon> michelled, could you do that as well?
2014-08-25T12:56:23 <michelled> Bosmon: we have a weekly floe planning meeting at 11 where we were going to go through that
2014-08-25T12:56:30 <Bosmon> oh ok
2014-08-25T12:56:31 <michelled> is it better for you if we change the time?
2014-08-25T12:56:33 <Bosmon> I\'ll come to that then
2014-08-25T12:56:34 <Bosmon> It\'s ok
2014-08-25T12:56:38 <michelled> ok, great
2014-08-25T12:57:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - as a quick update, I realised just after you went home on Friday that our model updating problems are really very simple
2014-08-25T12:57:07 <Bosmon> We are just updating the wrong form of the model
2014-08-25T12:57:30 <Bosmon> The feedback buttons shouldn\'t update a hash of booleans, but simply a model that consists of a single string
2014-08-25T12:57:39 <Bosmon> Very similar situation to the audio metadata problem we had earlier
2014-08-25T12:57:54 <Bosmon> The model can take on the values "like", "dislike" or "none"
2014-08-25T12:58:02 <Bosmon> Activating any of the buttons sets the model to the respective field
2014-08-25T12:58:08 <Bosmon> Deactivating any of the buttons sets it to "none"
2014-08-25T12:58:47 <Bosmon> The visual state of the buttons, however, is derived from the booleans - and we just use the standard "arrayToBooleans" expander to relate the two views of the model
2014-08-25T12:59:05 <Bosmon> It is really very simple, and hopefully we will just get better about thinking about these situations more quickly
2014-08-25T12:59:22 <Bosmon> The oddity here is that the visual state of the UI is derived from a different view of the model to the one we update when the UI is operated
2014-08-25T12:59:32 <Bosmon> Perhaps that\'s what made the solution hard to think of

2014-08-25T13:45:30 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-08-25T13:54:55 <anastasiac> good morning, jhung. Question for you about the EPUB simulation work: Should the simulation HTML file work straight out of the repo if I just open it in a browser, or have there been modifications made that mean it will only launch in the context of the EPUB archive
2014-08-25T13:54:56 <anastasiac> ?
2014-08-25T13:55:34 <jhung> anastasiac: the HTML file should work straight in a browser.
2014-08-25T13:57:12 <anastasiac> hm. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting syntax errors on the CDATA line and the sim is not loading, jhung
2014-08-25T13:57:38 <jhung> ah.
2014-08-25T13:58:24 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-08-25T13:59:03 <jhung> That\'s right. EPUB requires that to load scripts anastasiac.
2014-08-25T13:59:54 <anastasiac> so what does that mean, jhung? That the sim isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually expected to work in a browser?
2014-08-25T14:00:33 <jhung> anastasiac: that\'s right.
2014-08-25T14:01:11 <anastasiac> ok, gotcha. Hows the a11y work on the sim going, jhung? I was chatting with michelled on Friday, and she said that making interactive stuff accessible is a top priority for the epub work
2014-08-25T14:01:14 <jhung> Ideally Pandoc should be adding it, but it doesn\'t anastasiac
2014-08-25T14:01:43 <jhung> anastasiac: I was just going to get started on that today. Maybe we can chat about it and see how we can divide work?
2014-08-25T14:01:59 <anastasiac> jhung, did you see my email to the list about pandoc?
2014-08-25T14:02:34 <jhung> reading now anastasiac
2014-08-25T14:07:00 <jhung> ah that\'s problematic anastasiac.
2014-08-25T14:09:08 <anastasiac> what are your thoughts, jhung?
2014-08-25T14:09:24 <jhung> I was talking to OpenStax and they use Docbook XML format to encode the content. Then they export that XML into EPUB anastasiac.
2014-08-25T14:09:41 <jhung> I\'ll forward you the email thread.
2014-08-25T14:10:25 <jhung> They have limitations too anastasiac but it may be worth investigating as a possible alternative.
2014-08-25T14:11:46 <anastasiac> as an aside, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a stack overflow trying to build the simulation into an epub, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not having any luck increasing the stack size; it just hangs. Any tips?
2014-08-25T14:11:48 <jhung> We can try calibre anastasiac. Perhaps it does a better job at not mangling our markup.
2014-08-25T14:12:04 <jhung> Yes. Check the notes wiki doc.
2014-08-25T14:12:08 <jhung> There
2014-08-25T14:12:17 <jhung> \'s a command to increase the stack size anastasiac
2014-08-25T14:12:36 <anastasiac> yes, jhung, I tried that, but the command seems to just hang
2014-08-25T14:14:00 <jhung> anastasiac: the +RTS -K100m -RTS didn\'t work? Hmmm let me try with my local copy.
2014-08-25T14:14:30 <anastasiac> it hangs, jhung. At least, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come back
2014-08-25T14:14:37 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing
2014-08-25T14:16:38 <jhung> works for me anastasiac I ran: pandoc +RTS -K100m -RTS 03-forces-simulation.html -t html -w epub3 -o 03-forces-simulation.epub -R
2014-08-25T14:17:14 <jhung> anastasiac: brb going to change locations.

2014-08-25T14:17:38 <anastasiac> ah, ok, I was just using that command by itself. Works now
2014-08-25T14:18:02 <anastasiac> so jhung, tell me more about the relationship between OpenStax and our exemplar efforts

2014-08-25T14:20:19 <jhung> anastasiac: here\'s what I\'m thinking:
2014-08-25T14:21:32 <jhung> It seems we have two streams of work: making inclusive content, and figuring out a usable workflow.
2014-08-25T14:22:32 <jhung> If pandoc is giving us issues then maybe we should start looking at alternatives\xe2\x80\xa6 including a manual process anastasiac?
2014-08-25T14:23:42 <anastasiac> jhung, a \xe2\x80\x9cmanual\xe2\x80\x9d process is basically what I was thinking of, though automating the manual process, perhaps using grunt, would be good.
2014-08-25T14:24:24 * michelled has quit
2014-08-25T14:24:50 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m still not entirely clear on what the priorities of this EPUB work is, jhung: whether or not we should focus on producing an accessible exemplar, regardless of how we do it, or whether we should be focusing on searching for the best tools to help. I was going to ask michelled for her input, but she just left the channel :-)
2014-08-25T14:25:37 <anastasiac> jhung, one thing michelled did say is that figuring out how to make interactive stuff accessible is a priority for the epub work, so getting that physics simulation more accessible is important.
2014-08-25T14:26:05 <anastasiac> I think we should probably just switch to \xe2\x80\x9cmanually\xe2\x80\x9d building an epub zip file for now, and document out experiences and processes
2014-08-25T14:26:26 <jhung> anastasiac: agreed. I think that\'s what our focus should be.
2014-08-25T14:28:18 <jhung> So we should convert our HTML into EPUB valid XML files and author those directly anastasiac? Since we would not be using a tool to convert.
2014-08-25T14:28:43 <jhung> Which is too bad because authoring in HtML is familiar to many people.
2014-08-25T14:30:05 <anastasiac> jhung, does EPUB3 require XML? The files pandoc produced were XHTML, and I found that if I pasted the HTML5 back into the body, it still worked
2014-08-25T14:30:28 * sgithens_ joined the channel
2014-08-25T14:30:46 <jhung> Sorry, I meant XHTML anastasiac.
2014-08-25T14:32:22 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I spend a little bit of time investigating our options for allowing people to author good html5 and still easily produce an epub3? I\xe2\x80\x99ll familiarize myself a bit more with the epub3 xhtml profile, etc
2014-08-25T14:32:25 * sgithens has quit
2014-08-25T14:33:21 <jhung> anastasiac: sounds good. I\'ll work on improving the inclusiveness of the simulation.

2014-08-25T14:58:23 <jhung> anastasiac: for the simulation, to make it more inclusive, we would provide a storyboard of the simulation (still image with a text description) of interesting moments. This way it can be a visual summary for those who have access to the simulation, as well as an alternative for those who need it.

2014-08-25T14:59:00 <anastasiac> jhung, is there anything we can do to make the simulation keyboard accessible?
2014-08-25T15:02:12 <jhung> anastasiac: I haven\'t investigated deeply. We first would need the un-minified version of the source code which we do not have.
2014-08-25T15:03:05 <anastasiac> ugh
2014-08-25T15:03:07 <jhung> anastasiac: also I think authors / publishers will be using inaccessible scripts a lot, so we would probably want to demonstrate "quick win" practices.
2014-08-25T15:04:24 <jhung> anastasiac: getting the un-minified source probably won\'t be hard\xe2\x80\xa6 but adapting it to be keyboard accessible may not be easy (there is 20K+ lines of code).
2014-08-25T15:04:35 <anastasiac> ugh
2014-08-25T15:04:49 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I guess let\xe2\x80\x99s see what else we can do
2014-08-25T15:06:48 <jhung> that\'s what I was thinking with the storyboard idea anastasiac. It provides an accessible alternative in different modalities. We could also produce a video of the simulation and use floe video player to provide transcripts and captions \xe2\x80\xa6 but that requires a bit more work to produce.
2014-08-25T15:07:00 <anastasiac> yeah

2014-08-25T16:22:33 <jhung> anastasiac: I found an interesting physics exercise on OpenStax. It\'s actually a JavaScript exercise (source code included) which the student is encouraged to program themselves and modify to see the effects. Perhaps we can adapt it? http://cnx.org/contents/cf7fe6a1-d979-4b18-adb0-7fbbd6e0db7e@2
2014-08-25T16:22:43 <jhung> The simulation outputs an SVG.
2014-08-25T16:23:22 <anastasiac> Sounds interesting, jhung. Is it actually an interactive simulation, or a programming exercise?
2014-08-25T16:24:00 <jhung> anastasiac: it\'s a programming exercise, but I\'m wondering how much work is involved to make it interactive.
2014-08-25T16:25:16 <anastasiac> good question, jhung. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start the process of getting the source code from PHET, but if you have to wait, perhaps you could learn a bit more about this content
