2014-06-20T17:30:33 <jhung> anastasiac: For the redesigned Fluid project website, should the link to API docs point to the wiki version or the one in github?
2014-06-20T17:31:29 <anastasiac> jhung: docs in general: github; API docs in particular: good question. We\'ve established that we don\'t want to use the ones on the wiki, but we don\'t have any in github yet
2014-06-20T17:32:50 <jhung> anastasiac: so I guess that means that we have no choice but to use the wiki version until we have a replacement?
2014-06-20T17:32:59 <anastasiac> <sigh>
2014-06-20T17:33:29 <anastasiac> Well, we do/will have component API pages in the new docs
2014-06-20T17:33:36 <anastasiac> so we can reference github for them
2014-06-20T17:33:52 <anastasiac> what we don\'t have is the framework function API docs.
2014-06-20T17:33:59 <anastasiac> for that, we\'re going to link directly to the code for now
2014-06-20T17:34:20 <anastasiac> jhung, what\'s the context for API links in the new website? One general link? specific things?
2014-06-20T17:34:35 <jhung> let me show you\xe2\x80\xa6 let me find a link anastasiac
2014-06-20T17:35:12 <jhung> In this design anastasiac http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/327842/FluidProject-WebsiteMockup.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1401984558871&api=v2
2014-06-20T17:35:28 <jhung> There is an "API" link under the Projects / Demos page.
2014-06-20T17:36:13 <jhung> So from what I understand, at this point there should actually be two links: One for the Component API in github, and another for Framework code?
2014-06-20T17:36:39 <anastasiac> hm
2014-06-20T17:37:29 <anastasiac> here\'s my suggestion, jhung: let\'s create a single page in the new docs that links to the component API pages; the website can link to that page
2014-06-20T17:38:03 <anastasiac> eventually, when we have framework API docs, we can either a) update the site to have two links, or b) modify the "start" page to reference both component and framework API
2014-06-20T17:38:06 <anastasiac> what do you think?
2014-06-20T17:44:30 <jhung> That sounds okay anastasiac. But we still need to somehow reference the Framework API, no? So currently we\'ll need 2 links?
2014-06-20T17:45:01 <anastasiac> jhung, there\'s nothing to reference currently. We have no valid framework API docs right now
2014-06-20T17:45:17 <anastasiac> we don\'t trust the docs in the wiki to be up-to-date
2014-06-20T17:45:25 <anastasiac> that\'s why we don\'t want to link to them
2014-06-20T17:46:21 <jhung> ok. Gotcha. Who should I talk to about creating this new page in the docs which will become a landing page anastasiac?
2014-06-20T17:47:16 <anastasiac> Maybe create a JIRA for it, jhung, with an explanation of how the website will link to it, and add that to the docs planning page: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation+Plan
2014-06-20T17:47:47 <jhung> sounds good anastasiac
