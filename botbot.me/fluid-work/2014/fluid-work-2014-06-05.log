2014-06-05T13:04:40 <amilchev> cindyli: hi, quick one: how can I make an invoker call two different functions depending on component\'s boolean option? For instance, an invoker to call "trueFunc" if boolValue is true and "falseFunc" if boolValue is false
2014-06-05T13:05:19 <amilchev> cindyli: I suppose something like the condition expander http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Renderer+Component+Tree+Expanders#RendererComponentTreeExpanders-ConditionExpander

2014-06-05T14:06:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks.. that\'s a known issue.. we removed it from the prefs framework demo in safari for that reason.. i guess we\'ll need to do the same for exploration tool.
2014-06-05T14:06:54 <colinclark> Does anyone know the source of the issue?
2014-06-05T14:09:11 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-06-05T14:12:45 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-06-05T14:12:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: i can\'t find a jira for the issue we found for the climate change demo :( I had looked into it earlier and couldn\'t find the exact cause.. the festival demo works http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/onlinedemo.html
2014-06-05T14:13:22 <Justin_o> so it could be something to do with the way it is being passed from our wrapper server, or maybe we are using an older version of the festival
2014-06-05T14:13:41 <colinclark> Is there a reason why you think it might be Festival?
2014-06-05T14:13:58 <colinclark> I mean, are you seeing some kind of malformed audio coming back or something?
2014-06-05T14:14:12 <colinclark> Or could it be Buzz, the library we are using to play audio across browsers?
2014-06-05T14:14:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: can\'t tell because the browser crashes right away
2014-06-05T14:14:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: and includes hitting the audio url directly
2014-06-05T14:14:28 <colinclark> ahhh
2014-06-05T14:14:34 <colinclark> that\xe2\x80\x99s interesting
2014-06-05T14:14:51 <colinclark> Well, it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly time
2014-06-05T14:15:07 <Justin_o> that\'s what i remember anyways, so there could be some details there that i\'m not getting completely correct
2014-06-05T14:15:12 <colinclark> to replace this all in favour of the new Speech API
2014-06-05T14:15:27 <colinclark> let me see if I can have a look at the audio coming back from the Festival server
2014-06-05T14:15:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2014-06-05T14:16:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: also i think this is only an issues with Safari 7.. i think Safari 6 works
2014-06-05T14:16:34 <colinclark> Okay, I see exactly what you mean
2014-06-05T14:16:56 <colinclark> This URL will cause Safari to crash: http://tts.idrc.ocadu.ca/?q=text%20to%20speech%20enabled
2014-06-05T14:21:46 <Justin_o> even this one http://tts.idrc.ocadu.ca/?q=text
2014-06-05T14:21:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2014-06-05T14:22:24 <colinclark> oh you know
2014-06-05T14:22:26 <colinclark> this is interesting...
2014-06-05T14:22:48 <colinclark> When i load that URL in Firefox, Justin_o, it asks me to activate the QuickTime plugin
2014-06-05T14:22:56 <colinclark> but Firefox has native support for playing .wav files
2014-06-05T14:23:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: really.. i don\'t think i get that
2014-06-05T14:23:17 <Justin_o> or maybe it\'s just on by default
2014-06-05T14:23:20 <colinclark> Could be
2014-06-05T14:23:26 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m on the beta channel, so it might be a new hting
2014-06-05T14:23:41 <colinclark> disabling plugins by default
2014-06-05T14:26:34 <colinclark> Looks like, Justin_o, that URL will crash the QuickTime Player, too
2014-06-05T14:26:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: i tried to switch the mp3 and wav file formats to have to ask to use plugins in firefox, but it didn\'t make a difference
2014-06-05T14:26:43 <colinclark> odd
2014-06-05T14:26:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: interesting.. i hadn\'t tried that
2014-06-05T14:27:04 <colinclark> although in Firefox, the QT player seems capable of playing it
2014-06-05T14:29:05 * jhung joined the channel
2014-06-05T14:30:03 <Justin_o> strange
2014-06-05T14:30:31 <colinclark> My working theory, Justin_o, is that it has to do with mime types or headers from our server
2014-06-05T14:30:43 <colinclark> Since the file itself, if downloaded, plays fine
2014-06-05T14:31:03 <colinclark> Now I just need to prove it
2014-06-05T14:31:42 <Justin_o> that seems reasonable
2014-06-05T14:32:54 * jhung_away has quit
2014-06-05T14:33:18 <colinclark> I really wish there was a MacPort for Festival
2014-06-05T14:37:20 <Justin_o> that would make it easier
2014-06-05T14:40:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: seems that mime type of the file is "application/octet-stream"
2014-06-05T14:40:59 <colinclark> Interesting
2014-06-05T14:41:06 <colinclark> we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything to set any server hearders
2014-06-05T14:41:07 <colinclark> headers
2014-06-05T14:41:20 <colinclark> we\xe2\x80\x99re just piping the output of the text2wave command straight into th response
2014-06-05T14:41:27 <Justin_o> that\'s what it looks like https://github.com/fluid-project/FestivalTextToSpeechService/blob/master/FestivalTextToSpeechService.js
2014-06-05T14:41:36 <colinclark> yup

2014-06-05T18:19:43 <jhung> vjoanna: I was just going to ask you if there was an updated design for the Fluid website, and I just saw you update it. :)
2014-06-05T18:25:37 <vjoanna> jhung: yep :) it\'s in the wiki as well http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/327842/FluidProject-WebsiteMockup.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1401984558871&api=v2 there\'s some icons missing, the about page still needs work, and the content is going to be rewritten
2014-06-05T18:26:35 <jhung> Structure-wise it\'s pretty stable vjoanna? Do you think I can start building the blocks or should I wait? I have EPUB to keep me busy so I\'m okay either way.
2014-06-05T18:31:58 <vjoanna> jhung: yep, i think structure wise it should be stable
