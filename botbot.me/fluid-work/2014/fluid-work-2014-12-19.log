2014-12-19T13:16:23 <Justin_o> i left a few comments. They aren't huge though.

2014-12-19T15:59:06 <Justin_o> simonjb, Bosmon7, cindyli: where did you want to meet for that security call today?
2014-12-19T15:59:27 <simonjb> shall we do vidyo?
2014-12-19T15:59:37 <Justin_o> sure
2014-12-19T15:59:43 <cindyli> sure
2014-12-19T16:00:04 <Justin_o> We should probably not use the fluid standup unless we'll be done in under 30 min
2014-12-19T16:00:34 <simonjb> shall we meet in your room, Justin_o?
2014-12-19T16:00:58 <Justin_o> okay
2014-12-19T16:01:27 <Justin_o> i'm there now
2014-12-19T16:01:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, cindyli: Please join my vidyo room

2014-12-19T16:19:52 <jessm> it\xe2\x80\x99ll be great to have you there
2014-12-19T16:20:05 <jessm> ah, and i\xe2\x80\x99m just now thinking you might not be on the mailing list\xe2\x80\xa6 so i\xe2\x80\x99ll forward a few emails to you

2014-12-19T18:27:18 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I finally got the websockets thing working
2014-12-19T18:28:42 <jhernandez> I still need to add some tests at it, but you can take a look at it here: https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/gpii-browser-integration
2014-12-19T18:32:13 <Bosmon> Hey, VVERNNANDDEZZ!
2014-12-19T18:32:21 <Bosmon> Excellent result!
2014-12-19T18:45:19 <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks ANTVANIQ! I'd have liked to make it more fluid(ish), ie, by using IoC
2014-12-19T18:47:44 <Bosmon> cool, it looks quite reasonable at first glance
2014-12-19T18:52:20 <jhernandez> glad to hear that, next week I'll create a proper pull request with some tests
2014-12-19T18:53:37 <jhernandez> still don't have any ideas about how're going to test that clients are connecting, retrieving settings, etc, so perhaps I'll bug you for that
2014-12-19T18:54:18 <jhernandez> have a nice weekend!
2014-12-19T18:54:20 <jhernandez> :)
