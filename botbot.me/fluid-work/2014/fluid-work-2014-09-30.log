2014-09-30T14:30:52 <cindyli> Justin_o: i issued a pull request to upgrade pouchDB in metadata demos: https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/45 can you review it?
2014-09-30T14:31:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, thanks
2014-09-30T14:31:10 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2014-09-30T14:37:25 <cindyli> Justin_o: is this the jira to re-struture contrast themes in Stylus: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5482
2014-09-30T14:37:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes that\'s the one
2014-09-30T14:38:05 <cindyli> cool, starting on it
2014-09-30T14:38:25 <Justin_o> the files we need to port are those in the css directory of the prefs framework folder
2014-09-30T14:40:55 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o. looking at the iteration plan, in your work removes fss, the notes says "Switch to using Stylus", is that for fluid.css or in general for other css too?
2014-09-30T14:42:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: the jira is specific to the preferences framework.. think we should start there.. if we can expand it reasonably later it might make sense, but i think at the moment the most complex files are the ones related to theming.
2014-09-30T14:43:33 <cindyli> ok, just make sure we don\'t conflict with each other
2014-09-30T14:48:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m not touching those css files
2014-09-30T14:48:13 <cindyli> ok

2014-09-30T15:25:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: looks like we have a failing test the feedback tests when run under IE 11
2014-09-30T15:25:44 <Justin_o> but it happens in master as well
2014-09-30T15:26:08 <cindyli> ha
2014-09-30T15:26:39 <cindyli> create a jira for it, what do you think, Justin_o
2014-09-30T15:28:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. i just finished filing one http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-243
2014-09-30T15:29:09 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o

2014-09-30T17:37:28 <danaayotte_> Justin_o here are the updated frames for PMT contexts and sets, I will also post to list http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/PMT-contexts-sets.pdf
2014-09-30T17:37:44 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: thanks
2014-09-30T17:37:54 <danaayotte_> let me know if you have any questions or comments, not sure if we\'ll be implementing syncing and sharing for review
2014-09-30T17:38:09 <danaayotte_> (shown in last few frames)
2014-09-30T17:38:25 <danaayotte_> Justin_o ^
2014-09-30T17:40:31 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: does that sidebar on the left always show?
2014-09-30T17:40:43 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: thanks for the note about the syncing and sharing
2014-09-30T17:41:48 <danaayotte_> Justin_o the "sets" button at the bottom collapses it
2014-09-30T17:42:42 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: ah i see
2014-09-30T17:43:03 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: how do you set the name of a set?
2014-09-30T17:44:38 <danaayotte_> Justin_o right, we\'ll need a frame or two to show that - the + at the top allows you to create a new set, which would take you to the same frame as the "Night-time" frame, but with a title entry field
2014-09-30T17:44:53 <danaayotte_> and I\'m thinking the title can be edited just by selecting it at any time
2014-09-30T17:45:12 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: okay.. sure that seems reasonable
2014-09-30T17:46:26 <Justin_o> cindyli: when would you like to talk through the frames?
2014-09-30T17:47:26 <cindyli> anytime, Justin_o
2014-09-30T17:49:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. do you have time now to talk?
2014-09-30T17:49:32 <cindyli> ya
