b'2014-09-02T18:44:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think my FLOE-196 branch is ready to update the unit tests.. should i pull in from your FLOE-195 first?
2014-09-02T18:45:16 <cindyli> yes, that would be good. thanks, Justin_o
2014-09-02T18:46:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: are all your current changes pushed up?
2014-09-02T18:47:35 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m adding a comment and cleaning up the code, will do another push soon. can you wait a few minutes?
2014-09-02T18:48:53 <Justin_o> sure, let me know when you\'re ready

2014-09-02T18:53:07 <cindyli> Bosmon and Justin_o, the latest for FLOE-195 has been pushed up. ready for another look
2014-09-02T18:53:24 <Bosmon> so fast!
2014-09-02T18:54:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - I don\'t think I see the push
2014-09-02T18:54:35 <Bosmon> latest commit is from 21 minutes ago
2014-09-02T18:55:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: it doesn\'t look like github updated the pull request either
2014-09-02T18:56:42 <cindyli> sorry, Bosmon and Justin_o, i guess i committed but not pushed. now should be there.
2014-09-02T18:58:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-09-02T18:58:30 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - can you answer the question about line 174?
2014-09-02T18:59:47 <cindyli> Bosmon: sorry, missed that comment. replying..
2014-09-02T19:01:27 <Bosmon> Also for line 204 - there was another piece of "direct view binding"

2014-09-02T19:39:18 <cindyli> yes, working on it, Bosmon, i finally realized the checkbox states are already tracked in the renderer component model. seems i\'ve successfully removed the new model path "isOtherChecked". but we probably still need the text area keyup binding because the model value for the text area is not updated at every key stroke. experimenting...
2014-09-02T19:39:34 <Bosmon> cindyli - hi, the keyup binding is fine as long as it is explained
2014-09-02T19:39:40 <cindyli> sorry about my slowness
2014-09-02T19:39:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: is there no longer a feedback loader?
2014-09-02T19:39:55 <Bosmon> It\'s just the other bindings that need to proceed in two stages - i) binding DOM to model, ii) processing model changes into other model changes
2014-09-02T19:40:00 <cindyli> Justin_o: there is. no more templateLoader
2014-09-02T19:40:18 <cindyli> ok, Bosmon
2014-09-02T19:40:25 <Bosmon> There should never be a case where a piece of model processing directly triggers a DOM change or vice versa
2014-09-02T19:40:45 <Bosmon> Otherwise we would, as Martin Fowler would have it, "violate model-view separation"
2014-09-02T19:41:39 <cindyli> ya, realizing that\xe2\x80\xa6 slowly\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2014-09-02T19:43:11 <Bosmon> Well it\'s odd.... I\'m sure I\'ve seen you doing this for 2-3 years now : P
2014-09-02T19:43:18 <Bosmon> But perhaps the reasons for what you were doing weren\'t always clear
2014-09-02T19:49:42 <colinclark> Don\'t apologize for your slowness, cindyli. You\'re awesome. :)
2014-09-02T19:52:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - you are indeed awesome
2014-09-02T19:54:15 <cindyli> you guys are always being so encouraging. hope I would be more awesome ;)
2014-09-02T19:55:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: how are the templates loaded now?
2014-09-02T19:56:20 <cindyli> Justin_o: feedbackLoader itself is an instance of the template loader
2014-09-02T19:56:59 <cindyli> Justin_o: feedbackLoader.js, line 22, the 2nd grade
2014-09-02T19:57:04 <Justin_o> oh separate file
2014-09-02T19:57:11 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2014-09-02T19:57:13 <cindyli> oh, right. yes
2014-09-02T20:07:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: when there\'s input in the text are, a model change call is used to turn on the corresponding check box. is calling refreshView() the only way to update UI with the new checkbox state? is there a way to only update the checkbox state without touching other fields on UI?
2014-09-02T20:08:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - there should be no "refreshView" - there should be a model listener whose only purpose is to listen to the model state and update the checkbox constantly

2014-09-02T20:08:23 <cindyli> oh
2014-09-02T20:08:30 <Bosmon> This is how our renderer "should always have worked" but of course it was always deficient
2014-09-02T20:08:39 <cindyli> ok
2014-09-02T20:08:41 <Bosmon> I believe we have a JIRA open against it for the last 5 years : P
2014-09-02T20:08:48 <colinclark> Does that JIRA involve fire?

2014-09-02T12:53:12 <Justin_o> I\'m working through FLOE-196. I\'ve almost got the functionality all in place. Just need to get the vote buttons to update the models correctly and save.
2014-09-02T12:53:25 <cindyli> that\'s great
2014-09-02T12:53:40 <Justin_o> then i\'ll fix up the styling, clean up the code, and try to update/create unit tests
2014-09-02T12:53:53 <cindyli> sounds good
2014-09-02T12:54:05 <Justin_o> i\'ve been making a bunch of changes to binddialog and feedback so i\'ll probably have conflicts from your changes :(
2014-09-02T12:54:12 <Justin_o> but hopefully it won\'t be too bad
2014-09-02T12:55:07 <cindyli> ha, very possible. i\'m making more changes into bindDialog to implement one tooltip for all

2014-09-02T13:52:56 <jhung> anastasiac: I have figured the necessary changes to make the phet simulation default to accessible mode and load the tug-of-war simulation directly. However I\'m now trying to figure out how to link to the javascript rather than embedding a minified version within the html content.
2014-09-02T13:54:02 <anastasiac> oh, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m ahead of you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it loading directly, and the build script builds the fully standalone, embedded version. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to test adding it to the epub to make sure it works there.
2014-09-02T13:55:57 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, the built file doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to validate, so it\xe2\x80\x99ll need some cleaning up, I guess

2014-09-02T14:09:14 <anastasiac> ok, thanks jhung
2014-09-02T14:09:52 <anastasiac> this is painful, jhung. The lines in this file are soo long, Aptana is overwhelmed. And I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to find a missing semicolon??
2014-09-02T14:10:44 <jhung> Try something like text-wrangler anastasiac. I found that it was slightly less painful.

2014-09-02T14:46:33 <jhung> Without the CDATA container, scripts won\'t work in some (all?) ereaders. Did not work with iBooks and Readium until it was included anastasiac.
2014-09-02T14:47:12 <jhung> For what it\'s worth, all of IDPF\'s examples have this container anastasiac.

2014-09-02T15:02:58 <anastasiac> it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even show up in iBooks
2014-09-02T15:03:03 <anastasiac> the sim, that is
2014-09-02T15:04:05 <jhung> anastasiac: without the CDATA container, you would get an error and the book would render properly up until the simulation.
2014-09-02T15:04:28 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve moved all the scripts into separate .js files entirely
2014-09-02T15:04:50 <jhung> Have you tested an EPUB anastasiac? Does it work?
2014-09-02T15:05:03 <anastasiac> jhung, it works in Chrome, not iBooks
2014-09-02T15:05:10 <anastasiac> well, it works in iBooks, but the sim just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear
2014-09-02T15:05:18 <anastasiac> the file doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up
2014-09-02T15:06:34 <jhung> ah, I\'m following now (was a bit confused). Do we need to declare the javascript in the manifest? Also does it work if we embed a minified version?
2014-09-02T15:06:39 <jhung> ^anastasiac
2014-09-02T15:06:57 <anastasiac> I updated the manifest, and it\xe2\x80\x99s working great in Chrome
2014-09-02T15:09:14 <anastasiac> jhung, I just tried merging your branch with the intro text. I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a different approach :-) The text appears briefly, then the sim takes over the entire screen. I\xe2\x80\x99ll play with putting the two in separate files.

2014-09-02T15:11:14 <jhung> anastasiac: that\'s interesting. Do you think it\'s worth pushing up your changes so I can work with it too? Otherwise I\'m going to start writing instructions for the simulation (for keyboard and mouse usage).
2014-09-02T15:11:34 <anastasiac> jhung, I think the instructions would be more helpful
2014-09-02T15:11:47 <jhung> alright anastasiac\'
2014-09-02T15:11:54 <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding ur comment of "we can\'t do direct "markup to markup" binding - this component needs a model". why is it better to do via a model? why cannot we directly bind an click or keyup event handler to manipulate the state of another dom element?
2014-09-02T15:14:42 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-09-02T15:24:16 <Bosmon> cindyli - it seems that the team is "reverting to the wild" :)
2014-09-02T15:24:25 <Bosmon> I was just mentioning this to michelled : P
2014-09-02T15:26:02 <cindyli> haha
2014-09-02T15:26:17 <Bosmon> Thankfully colinclark is back now to explain to me how I can handle this situation :)
2014-09-02T15:27:45 <Bosmon> Rather than running around in a blind panic at discovering that the members of the core team who are responsible for mentoring others have forgotten why it is that we have recommended that applications with a UI should be expressed with respect to a model rather than making direct bindings in the view layer : P
2014-09-02T15:28:26 <colinclark> oh hi
2014-09-02T15:29:17 <colinclark> Well, I know you hate repeating yourself, Bosmon
2014-09-02T15:29:29 <Bosmon> Here\'s a useful article by Martin Fowler: http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html
2014-09-02T15:29:57 * slim has quit
2014-09-02T15:30:05 <colinclark> But it\'s always useful to be reminded about critical issues
2014-09-02T15:30:41 <colinclark> That article is a good one
2014-09-02T15:31:49 <Bosmon> We generally have recommended against "using the DOM as a model" for many years - although we did do this in our very earliest stages (2007-2008)
2014-09-02T15:32:14 <Bosmon> Applications which don\'t have a public model are hard for other developers to understand, customise, and add decorated behaviour to
2014-09-02T15:32:41 <Bosmon> Using the DOM as a model makes it hard to transform the UI layer of an application into another form, or adapt it easily
2014-09-02T15:33:32 <colinclark> One the main use cases that a model-based approach supports, cindyli, is multiple "views" or presentations
2014-09-02T15:34:03 <colinclark> which, being involved in accessibility, we know how important it is to be able to provide alternative modes of control and presentation
2014-09-02T15:34:21 * slim joined the channel
2014-09-02T15:34:59 <colinclark> Having that model/view separation that the Martin Fowler article discusses makes it much easier to do this
2014-09-02T15:35:39 <colinclark> And perhaps more practically, it tends to make your code easier to refactor and change
2014-09-02T15:36:18 <colinclark> When, for example, the DOM changes in a redesign
2014-09-02T15:36:26 <colinclark> or when new features are added and so on

2014-09-02T18:33:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: the pull request for FLOE-195 is ready for another look
2014-09-02T18:33:52 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli
2014-09-02T18:33:54 <Bosmon> looking now
2014-09-02T18:34:00 <cindyli> thanks!
2014-09-02T18:36:23 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - can you still explain the "bindTextareaKeyup" binder?
2014-09-02T18:36:27 <Bosmon> What interaction does this provide?
2014-09-02T18:36:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: it detects if there\'s input in the feedback text area
2014-09-02T18:37:35 <cindyli> if the input is detected, the corresponding checkbox, which is called "other", should be checked
2014-09-02T18:37:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - what if the user presses a key that produces no input?
2014-09-02T18:38:52 <cindyli> bindTextareaKeyup checks the length of the value in the text area. so, if there\'s no input, the model change won\'t happen
2014-09-02T18:42:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok - could you explain this intention in an implementation comment above the function?
2014-09-02T18:43:48 <cindyli> Bosmon: what is "an implementation comment above the function" that you refer to?
2014-09-02T18:43:58 <cindyli> i see, add a comment
2014-09-02T18:44:03 <cindyli> no problem
2014-09-02T18:44:07 <Bosmon> cheers!
