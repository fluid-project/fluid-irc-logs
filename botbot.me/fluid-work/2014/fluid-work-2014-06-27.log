2014-06-27T13:41:31 <amilchev> hi Justin_o
2014-06-27T13:42:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: quick one about Colin\'s comment on pull request for websockets (on github): Good catch,\xc2\xa0@jobara! This should definitely be moved up to configurable options and use templating to generate the URL rather than string concatenation.
2014-06-27T13:42:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: what does "templating" stand for here? How should I create the URL?
2014-06-27T13:43:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: you can use fluid.stringTemplate it takes in a string with with tokens to be filled.. these are filled with the values from an accompanying object
2014-06-27T13:44:23 <Justin_o> so something like fluid.stringTemplate("Hello %something", {something: "World!"});
2014-06-27T13:44:35 <Justin_o> that should return "Hello World!"
2014-06-27T13:44:48 <amilchev> Justin_o: got it, thanks
2014-06-27T13:47:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: no problem... let me know if you have any more questions
