b'2014-01-06T21:45:25 <colinclark> Are you ok? Is it freezing there? Did I see that it\'s illegal for anyone to drive in Indianapolis today?
2014-01-06T21:45:33 <sgithens> it was just until noon
2014-01-06T21:45:36 <sgithens> It\'s damn cold
2014-01-06T21:45:41 <sgithens> my power is on
2014-01-06T21:45:52 <sgithens> but some peoples on the block are out, so they are camping at my house
2014-01-06T21:45:59 <sgithens> we\'re having a slumber party
2014-01-06T21:46:04 <colinclark> thank goodness
2014-01-06T21:46:07 <colinclark> yay!
2014-01-06T21:46:26 <sgithens> a huge huge branch came down from my tree in the back, amazing missing all structures and power lines
2014-01-06T21:46:53 <sgithens> lots of folks we know actually had their pipes freeze
2014-01-06T21:47:30 <sgithens> again, amazing, my swath of territory is still equipped with enough resources to attend GoToMeetings
2014-01-06T21:48:04 <sgithens> It\'s pretty close to a science fiction outpost
2014-01-06T21:49:24 <sgithens> As I sit here, on Ginger World GPII-1, my ship enables to communicate with remote colonies via only github pull requests.
2014-01-06T21:50:02 <sgithens> After submitting or reviewing a pull request, I go into cryo slumber for several years, as the optics ferry my messages far away and back again
2014-01-06T21:50:21 <sgithens> waking up for a week to review and code and merge, and then slumber once again.

2014-01-06T21:56:25 <cindyli> sgithens: regarding the preference server data store, there was one created a couple of months ago for the exploration tool demo: https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/explorationTool/js/GpiiStore.js
2014-01-06T21:57:35 <cindyli> however, by default, the exploration tool still uses cookie based store rather than this one \'cuz the demo is using one user to fetch/save preferences. If multiple users were playing with the demo, their preference selections would be overwriting each other
2014-01-06T21:58:18 * colinclark has quit
2014-01-06T21:58:23 <sgithens> cindyli: Cool, seems pretty  fine for demo/prototyping
2014-01-06T21:58:43 <cindyli> do you need more details on how to use this GPII data store, sgithens?
2014-01-06T22:00:02 <cindyli> one heads-up is that this data store requires the GPII server to be CORS enabled in order to handle cross origin ajax requests
2014-01-06T22:00:15 <cindyli> http://enable-cors.org/
2014-01-06T22:00:18 <sgithens> cindyli: Well, I\'m sort of long term stratagizing at the moment.  I\'m hoping we eventually have a thing where you just include the JS library in your webapp, and use whatever sort of auth to fetch the preferences, with helpers to tranform your page maybe.  Like these maps or any other type of JS API offering: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple
2014-01-06T22:01:02 <sgithens> like when I can just include the GPII JS library in my webapp, to update my webapp based on preference needs
2014-01-06T22:01:12 <cindyli> ok
2014-01-06T22:01:24 <sgithens> I *am* definately interested in the current specifics though
2014-01-06T22:01:40 <sgithens> and am going to check out your prefsEditor demo
2014-01-06T22:02:08 <sgithens> I\'m simultaneoulsy trying to build demos and think forward 3 years :)
2014-01-06T22:02:17 <cindyli> :
2014-01-06T22:02:18 <cindyli> :)
2014-01-06T22:02:24 <cindyli> let me know if you have questions, sgithens, or anything i can help
2014-01-06T22:02:37 <sgithens> I will definately for sure

2014-01-06T16:59:29 <cindyli> fluid-everyone: i\'m pasting my stand-up update here since my audio didn\'t seem working with the connect room. As a few of you have mentioned we had a chat on how to continue with metadata demo. I am starting on the metadata status panel.
2014-01-06T17:00:10 <colinclark> thanks cindyli
2014-01-06T17:00:17 <colinclark> sorry connect was acting up
2014-01-06T17:01:20 <cindyli> np, colinclark. might be my audio or connection problem. great that we have other ways to communicate :)
2014-01-06T17:01:42 <colinclark> jessm has an RFP finished now that will allow us to buy a whole new conferencing system
2014-01-06T17:01:49 <colinclark> so it will get better in the next few months
2014-01-06T17:04:58 <jhung> anastasiac: yep. I\'ll be updating our documentation with those notes.
2014-01-06T17:05:12 <anastasiac> ok, excellent, jhung
2014-01-06T17:05:13 <anastasiac> thanks
2014-01-06T17:05:34 <jhung> np
2014-01-06T17:07:41 <Justin_o_> jhung, danaayotte: i\'ll probably start working on the bugs and the text description panel. Could you please send me the jiras for those when you have them.
2014-01-06T17:11:00 <danaayotte> will do Justin_o
2014-01-06T17:11:05 <danaayotte> Justin_o_

2014-01-06T17:12:11 <jhung> Justin_o_: yup.
2014-01-06T17:22:18 <Justin_o_> yzen: do you know when you might get alexander and chris\' pull requests into the gpii repo?

2014-01-06T17:29:21 <Justin_o_> yzen: that should be okay.. just catching up on things... chris has also filed a new pull request that is based on those, but is currently still a in progress
2014-01-06T17:29:33 <yzen> ok
2014-01-06T17:38:33 <sgithens> Is KasparNET back from break?
2014-01-06T17:43:12 <colinclark> He is, sgithens!
2014-01-06T17:43:39 <sgithens> awesome
2014-01-06T17:43:46 <sgithens> today is a snow day here
2014-01-06T17:43:52 <sgithens> campus is closed
2014-01-06T17:49:07 <danaayotte> Justin_o_: I have created FLOE-135 and FLOE-136 for metadata bugs so far
2014-01-06T17:57:15 <sgithens> colinclark:  Going back to San Diego, and for this call I\'m about to have with the technical folks at UW Mad.
2014-01-06T17:58:00 <sgithens> Is the thing were we have a javascript API for a webapp to go check a users preferences, is that *itself* called UI Options, or is UI Options just a consumer/demo app of it.
2014-01-06T17:58:20 <colinclark> So, I don\'t quite know how to answer the question
2014-01-06T17:58:28 <colinclark> but I can try to give background about things around your question
2014-01-06T17:58:41 <colinclark> and hopefully something will be useful
2014-01-06T17:58:52 <sgithens> because I want to touch on that in the call, is that part of the project may inculde their webapps using that API
2014-01-06T17:58:55 <colinclark> So we have the Preferences Server, which is the RESTful service that you can use to get and set a user\'s preferences
2014-01-06T17:59:07 <colinclark> though increasingly clients will use the Cloud-based Flow Manager instead
2014-01-06T17:59:24 <colinclark> and then there\'s the Preferences Framework, which is used to build user interfaces for editing a preference set
2014-01-06T17:59:33 <colinclark> the PMT and PCP and UI Options are all built using the Preferences Framework
2014-01-06T17:59:54 <colinclark> and it includes things like a DataStore for saving/fetching preferences in the GPII Preferences Server
2014-01-06T18:00:07 <colinclark> UI Options itself is just one of many types of preferences editors
2014-01-06T18:00:20 <colinclark> the one that sits on the top of a web page, and you can pull it down and edit some basic preferences
2014-01-06T18:00:56 <colinclark> but it\'s certainly a good place to start connecting up with the GPII--integrating a web application with UI Options
2014-01-06T18:01:38 <sgithens> So, in the Facebook/Wordpress plugin scenerio, There is a javascript API we provide, but their server has to do an out of band request to us and then return the results back from the page, and it involves some sort of Auth thing like openid, etc.  I thought that was roughly the workflow
2014-01-06T18:01:48 <colinclark> This is probably the hottest demo of UI Options, which includes the Simplification and Text to Speech enactors: http://demo.floeproject.org/integration-demos/uiOptions/ClimateChange.html
2014-01-06T18:02:14 <colinclark> sgithens: Yes, that\'s more or less right
2014-01-06T18:02:20 <sgithens> I guess I was thinking they wouldn\'t actually be editing their preferences there, it would just be fetching them
2014-01-06T18:02:34 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: there are some documentation related jiras that are marked as needs commit here http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2014-01-06T18:02:51 <colinclark> The Preferences Server supports CORS, so it can be configured to receive cross-origin requests
2014-01-06T18:02:52 <anastasiac> Justin_o, thanks for the heads-up. I\'ll have a look this afternoon
2014-01-06T18:03:06 <colinclark> in the long run, though, all third-party applications, including instances of UI Options, will be issued OAuth client credentials
2014-01-06T18:03:16 <colinclark> and will go through the online Flow Manager for most of this
2014-01-06T18:03:22 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: i think i can review some of those.. what would you like me to do when the review is done.. just close the jira?
2014-01-06T18:03:26 <colinclark> I have some documentation and diagrams I just made about that
2014-01-06T18:03:35 <colinclark> stuck in a Word doc but I\'m in the midst of posting it the wiki
2014-01-06T18:03:40 <colinclark> I\'ll send you the Word doc in the meantime, sgithens
2014-01-06T18:03:42 <sgithens> cool
2014-01-06T18:03:44 <sgithens> thanks
2014-01-06T18:04:13 <anastasiac> Justin_o, sure, if the docs look good, just add a comment to the JIRA that you\'ve reviewed it (add a link to the page if the JIRA doesn\'t already include it) and close it
2014-01-06T18:04:14 <anastasiac> thanks
2014-01-06T18:05:07 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: okay.. thanks..
2014-01-06T18:06:31 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: i\'m going to remove the "draft" note at the top of the page too
2014-01-06T18:06:46 <anastasiac> yes, Justin_o, do that :-)
2014-01-06T18:07:57 <sgithens> colinclark: With our OAuth support... who is working on that right now?  Does that project have a schedule yet?
2014-01-06T18:10:00 <sgithens> colinclark: Also it\'s funny when you mentioned worrying about libreoffice when switching platforms.  Usually everything I open looks pretty good, but this thing you sent is rendering awfully :p
2014-01-06T18:11:05 <sgithens> with this oauth support, we should be able to demo the case where you\'re using like google/facebook/someone else as a provider right?
2014-01-06T18:18:10 <Justin_o_> cindyli: could you please review this http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5165
2014-01-06T18:18:19 <Justin_o_> it\'s documentation review
2014-01-06T18:18:30 <cindyli> ah. sure, Justin_o_
2014-01-06T18:18:45 <Justin_o_> cindyli: thanks
2014-01-06T18:18:51 <cindyli> np
2014-01-06T18:30:54 <cindyli> anastasiac: is this the doc page for http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5165 that needs to be reviewed: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Creating+Enactors
2014-01-06T18:32:16 <anastasiac> cindyli, no, I suspect it\'s this page: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Enactors  We\'d like to have enactor docs that are NOT only part of a tutorial
2014-01-06T18:32:50 <cindyli> ok, thanks, anastasiac
2014-01-06T18:41:12 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: i\'m looking over http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Builder
2014-01-06T18:42:00 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: we have the fluid.prefs.create function now to be a one-stop function for creating and instantiating a prefs framework stack
2014-01-06T18:42:15 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: i\'m wondering if we should document this instead, or would you want both
2014-01-06T18:42:18 <Justin_o_> ?
2014-01-06T18:42:37 <anastasiac> Justin_o, we should document the simplest, recommended way of doing things :-)
2014-01-06T18:44:12 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: looks like you have that here http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Preferences+Editor
2014-01-06T18:44:45 <anastasiac> ah, good
2014-01-06T18:44:58 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: did you want me to drop the builder docs?
2014-01-06T18:45:30 <Justin_o_> it\'s good to show the inner workings
2014-01-06T18:45:37 * michelled has quit
2014-01-06T18:45:53 <anastasiac> Justin_o, probably not; isn\'t there still the need to use the builder in some more complex use cases? You probably have a better idea than we do. We might want to keep it, but preface it with a note saying "use fluid.prefs.create() instead"
2014-01-06T18:46:01 <anastasiac> or something like that
2014-01-06T18:48:32 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: makes sense i\'ll do that

2014-01-06T19:11:39 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: question for you.. do you have a suggestion on how to use dynamic components with the model relay
2014-01-06T19:15:44 <cindyli> anastasiac: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Enactors is marked as "still incomplete". do you have more stuff to add or just \'cuz it needs a review?
2014-01-06T19:16:49 <anastasiac> cindyli, that\'s probably just because it needs review, so if the review thinks the page is complete, we can remove the \'incomplete\' note
2014-01-06T19:17:12 <cindyli> got u, thanks, anastasiac
2014-01-06T19:24:08 <cindyli> Justin_o_: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5165 has been reviewed and closed. should I remove it from "FLOE iteration page"?

2014-01-06T19:56:09 <colinclark> the Cloud4All Word template is pretty intense, so I\'m not surprised it renders terribly
2014-01-06T19:56:42 <colinclark> And as for the OAuth support, yes I think this should cover the case of third-party apps like Facebook/Google/etc. wanting to access a user\'s preferences

2014-01-06T21:31:16 <colinclark> No
2014-01-06T21:31:23 <colinclark> but it wouldn\'t be hard to do, I don\'t think
2014-01-06T21:31:41 <anastasiac> yzen, I\'m reviewing this page right now: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Configuration  Can we chat tomorrow about what\'s there? i.e. can you also review it today so that you recall what it says?
2014-01-06T21:31:44 <colinclark> Justin_o_ and cindyli did some work on the Preferences Server data store a few months ago
2014-01-06T21:31:51 <colinclark> so they might have a working demo?
