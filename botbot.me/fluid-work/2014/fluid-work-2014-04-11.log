b'2014-04-11T17:58:26 <Bosmon> Hopefully he will at least put back the "trailing" option
2014-04-11T17:58:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i hope so
2014-04-11T17:58:47 <Bosmon> The docs have always been deprecating of "white" itself
2014-04-11T17:58:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what are you thoughts on using an older version of jshint?
2014-04-11T17:58:59 <Bosmon> But it seems that they made a commentment at least to "trailing"
2014-04-11T17:59:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. the white is deprecated, but i didn\'t see anything mentioned for removing the trailing whitespace
2014-04-11T17:59:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it seems undesirable... we already went to some efforts to try to adopt the current version of a mainstream package rather than our own fork of one
2014-04-11T17:59:42 <Bosmon> Let\'s see what he says
2014-04-11T17:59:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i agree
2014-04-11T18:00:04 <Bosmon> I think he will agree to reinstate "trailing"
2014-04-11T18:00:56 <Bosmon> And we can probably live without "white" since as he says the rules were a bit peculiar in any case
2014-04-11T18:01:00 <Justin_o> yes.. i expect so.. or at least a good explanation...
2014-04-11T18:01:18 <Bosmon> And then we can shed a couple more jshint:ignore lines : P
2014-04-11T18:01:51 <Bosmon> I\'ll commit your branch today anyway since it will just cause conflicts to accumulate with other pull requests if we leave it
2014-04-11T18:01:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) i\'m not sure we can get rid of the others.. i don\'t think they were for white space
2014-04-11T18:02:02 <Bosmon> I think there was one whitespace one
2014-04-11T18:02:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for that
2014-04-11T18:02:11 <Bosmon> Where I had some variables assigned on the same line
2014-04-11T18:02:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m pretty excited to see this go in
2014-04-11T18:02:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s been a lot of tough work
2014-04-11T18:02:31 <Bosmon> Thanks for staying committed to it
2014-04-11T18:02:51 <Justin_o> :) no problem.. glad to have this update
2014-04-11T18:03:01 <Bosmon> It took quite an age simply to read the pull, how long must it have taken for you to write it : P

2014-04-11T13:40:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ve been talking with Antranig and Justin about adding instructions for deploying Bower.  I just created a ticket here:  http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5308
2014-04-11T13:41:06 <the-t-in-rtf> I also created a branch and will post a link once I have something to look at.
2014-04-11T13:41:29 <the-t-in-rtf> s/deploying Bower/deploying Infusion via Bower/
2014-04-11T13:42:33 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: that\'s cool, thanks for that
2014-04-11T13:43:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to write up the client side dependencies in the package file as well as versions.
2014-04-11T13:43:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Do we already track that somewhere?
2014-04-11T13:44:33 <Justin_o> the package.json file should contain the version number
2014-04-11T13:44:53 <Justin_o> currently it\'s at 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT and will simply be 1.5.0 at release
2014-04-11T13:45:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I saw that.  By "versions" in this case I mean the supported versions of jQuery and other client-side dependencies.
2014-04-11T13:45:45 <Justin_o> as far as dependencies go currently those are all included in the repository along side our code. Although making a switch to bower would allow us to separate things out more in the future
2014-04-11T13:45:53 <Justin_o> ah okay
2014-04-11T13:46:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I am hoping to help with that\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2014-04-11T13:46:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I will look at the versions we have checked in.
2014-04-11T13:46:31 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: you can take a look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.txt
2014-04-11T13:46:53 <Justin_o> while the file itself isn\'t up-to-date yet, the dependency section should be
2014-04-11T13:47:11 <Justin_o> the section titled Third Party Software in Infusion
2014-04-11T13:47:17 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s cool.  For now I need to answer the question about what the "main file" is for us.
2014-04-11T13:47:20 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a bower thing.
2014-04-11T13:47:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, would that be the grunt file?
2014-04-11T13:48:21 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hmm good question.. i\'d be inclined to go with the same as what is in the package.json file https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/package.json#L30
2014-04-11T13:48:30 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: however, could you tell me more about what it is specifically used for
2014-04-11T13:49:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m looking at how other people have used it and checking the docs now
2014-04-11T13:49:20 <the-t-in-rtf> bootstrap used multiples, basically one for each major css and js resource
2014-04-11T13:49:51 <the-t-in-rtf> jquery used jquery.js as its single entry
2014-04-11T13:50:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, fluid.js seems right based on the four libraries I\'ve looked at.
2014-04-11T13:51:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Bootstrap is the only outlier.
2014-04-11T13:51:12 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: interesting.. the grunt script assembles packages of for us. so we have very few files that can be run on there own
2014-04-11T13:51:23 <Justin_o> okay
2014-04-11T13:51:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I think they are mainly looking for the main file you would reference from the client side, but that is a fair point.
2014-04-11T13:52:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Every example I\'ve seen is the single file you would include in your document\'s head.
2014-04-11T13:52:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, let\'s come back to that.
2014-04-11T13:52:31 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay.. cool.. if you are interested you can see an example of one of our dependency files here https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/frameworkDependencies.json
2014-04-11T13:52:36 <the-t-in-rtf> They are now asking me if we have amd, es6, globals, and/or node modules
2014-04-11T13:52:55 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: sure, i should stress that Fluid.js isn\'t a single build file either... but yes, lets come back to that point after
2014-04-11T13:53:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it wants to know what types of packages we expose.
2014-04-11T13:54:11 <Justin_o> by globals i\'m thinking you mean what global namespace we use.. which in this case would be "fluid" and "fluid_1_5" for allowing multiple versions to be run
2014-04-11T13:54:41 <Justin_o> we shouldn\'t have any node_modules dependencies other than those needed for the grunt build scripts
2014-04-11T13:55:00 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-04-11T13:55:06 <Justin_o> i don\'t think we use any es6 specific features, as we still support older browsers ( IE8)
2014-04-11T13:55:49 <jhung> cindyli: I updated my branch. There were some conflicts when merging your changes, but I think I got them sorted out. Please update with my branch.
2014-04-11T13:56:55 * clown joined the channel
2014-04-11T13:58:53 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: also i don\'t believe we use amd at all, except again possibly through the grunt build scripts
2014-04-11T14:01:47 <cindyli> sure, thanks, jhung
2014-04-11T14:08:06 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-04-11T14:18:02 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o:  I have gone through all deps, adding those that exist, making note of those that aren\'t already in bower.  My only question is, is any of these the version of the open sans font we use?  http://bower.io/search/?q=open-sans
2014-04-11T14:23:24 <Justin_o> jhung: would you be able to confirm the above question about the open sans font we use?
2014-04-11T14:25:06 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf, Justin_o: When possible use / link the one that is hosted by google since it may already be cached in the user\'s client.
2014-04-11T14:26:13 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf, Justin_o: this is the one: http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans
2014-04-11T14:28:18 <Justin_o> jhung: the-t-in-rtf is looking into dependency management through bower
2014-04-11T14:28:35 <Justin_o> jhung: i wonder if you are recommending that we don\'t use a local version of it at all, and use the google version always instead
2014-04-11T14:30:05 <jhung> Justin_o: For production I would link since we can take advantage of any caching. For development, a local copy would be good if you\'re without an internet connection (although your browser may still cache it).
2014-04-11T14:33:52 <Justin_o> jhung: i don\'t think we have a mechanism in place yet to make that type of distinction unfortunately :(
2014-04-11T14:36:34 <jhung> Justin_o, the-t-in-rtf - not sure which of those three open-sans fonts in bower is the one we\'ve used from Google. I suppose you\'d have to verify manually.
2014-04-11T14:38:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I found a package that points to the same Google URL.
2014-04-11T14:39:12 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: great, thanks
2014-04-11T14:39:31 <jhung> awesome
2014-04-11T14:40:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, etc.:  Here is my first pass at the package format:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/infusion/blob/FLUID-5308/bower.json
2014-04-11T14:41:19 <the-t-in-rtf> The two things I know we need are a reference to the core client-side js as a single file, and a list of stuff to exclude
2014-04-11T14:43:11 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: could explain that a bit more, i just want to make sure I\'m clear on what is needed
2014-04-11T14:45:01 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - thanks for the response re linting
2014-04-11T14:45:10 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: also for the dependencies in your bower package.. is there an option for dev dependencies. the mockjax is really only used for unit testing
2014-04-11T14:45:10 <Bosmon> Do you know if the bug is reported upstream with jshint?
2014-04-11T14:45:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem.. any thoughts on what we should do about that
2014-04-11T14:45:31 <Bosmon> Or is there a slightly earlier version we can use that happens to support both ignore and whitespace?
2014-04-11T14:45:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i reported it on jshint\'s issue tracker
2014-04-11T14:45:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s cool
2014-04-11T14:46:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m not sure about that.. it doesn\'t look like there is a grunt plugin that works at least, not sure if there is a direct jshint version that does
2014-04-11T14:46:22 <Bosmon> If we can\'t find a version that supports both features, we will just have to wait for a fix
2014-04-11T14:46:27 <Bosmon> But I\'ll commit the branch anyway
2014-04-11T14:46:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. i guess we\'ll need to file a new jira for that
2014-04-11T14:47:08 <Justin_o> for getting the fixed version whenever it is available

2014-04-11T17:16:47 <jhung> I found some bugs though.
2014-04-11T17:17:03 <jhung> 1. The title should change if editing an existing resource.
2014-04-11T17:17:41 <cindyli> what should the title be changed to?
2014-04-11T17:18:02 <cindyli> Edit a resource
2014-04-11T17:18:06 <jhung> 2. "Choose all that apply" appears too many times. It should only appear when "Yes" is chosen.
2014-04-11T17:18:16 <jhung> 3. Restart doesn\'t work anymore
2014-04-11T17:18:17 <jhung> ?
2014-04-11T17:18:37 <jhung> Title should be "Climate Change Impacts"
2014-04-11T17:18:45 <cindyli> ok
2014-04-11T17:20:01 <jhung> thanks cindyli
2014-04-11T17:22:16 <cindyli> jhung: i merged in your branch. did you forget to commit some font icon files? the icons for restart, create, edit are missing
