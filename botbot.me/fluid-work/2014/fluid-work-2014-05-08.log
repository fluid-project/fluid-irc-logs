2014-05-08T12:52:33 <cindyli> good morning simonjb
2014-05-08T12:52:44 * Justin_o joined the channel
2014-05-08T12:53:13 <simonjb> cindyli: I see that you added a page to the wiki yesterday on converting to markdown -- thanks for doing that
2014-05-08T12:53:32 <cindyli> my pleasure, simonjb
2014-05-08T12:53:36 <simonjb> cindyli: I added some notes on file naming and on links
2014-05-08T12:53:48 <cindyli> that\'s great
2014-05-08T12:55:08 <simonjb> cindyli: I did have one question: you suggest using <code> -- markdown has backticks you can use, as in `foo.bar()` -- was there a reason to prefer <code>?
2014-05-08T12:57:56 <cindyli> simonjb: good to know about the backticks. is that another way to highlight code related words in sentences? if so, we can add taht into the document. Justin_o & anastasiac, thoughts?
2014-05-08T12:58:28 <cindyli> Justin_o and anastasiac, we are talking about this section:
2014-05-08T12:58:29 <cindyli> "The highlighted words such as option names in the document
2014-05-08T12:58:29 <cindyli> Wrap those words in <code> element."
2014-05-08T12:58:35 <simonjb> http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#code
2014-05-08T12:59:10 <Justin_o> cindyli: we\'d need to use <code> in a the html blocks for example in <table> but should probably use the ` in the markdown syntax
2014-05-08T12:59:21 <cindyli> i see. will update the doc
2014-05-08T12:59:28 <simonjb> thanks cindyli
2014-05-08T12:59:30 <anastasiac> the backticks work in basic markdown, but if you\'re using actual html for a table, for example, the backticks won\'t work inside the html. there, you\'ll actually have to use the <code> elements yourself
2014-05-08T12:59:45 <cindyli> cool. thanks, guys
2014-05-08T13:00:19 <simonjb> Justin_o, anastasiac, cindyli: I see that we have a note "All images we\'ve identified so far are small and suitable to be checked into github alongside our docs pages. Flag the issue if you run into an image which seems unsuitably large."
2014-05-08T13:00:37 <simonjb> did you resolve this yesterday?

2014-05-08T13:05:41 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-05-08T13:08:32 <cindyli> simonjb: you mean the issue with large images? Justin_o: what was the decision from ur discussion with Bosmon? use links?
2014-05-08T13:09:00 <simonjb> cindyli: yeah, exactly
2014-05-08T13:26:42 * yzen joined the channel
2014-05-08T13:26:45 <Justin_o> simonjb:, cindyli: Bosmon was saying that the pages contain images that are small enough that we should just check them in.
2014-05-08T13:28:48 <cindyli> Justin_o: I think simonjb is asking about the large images? we\'ll think about the solution when we run into them? :)
2014-05-08T13:29:09 <simonjb> I was asking in general
2014-05-08T13:29:53 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay..
2014-05-08T13:31:44 <simonjb> I\'m just trying to get a sense of where we are at regarding images -- yesterdat we hadn\'t made a decision -- have we now decided to commit them to infusion-docs?
2014-05-08T13:42:38 <simonjb> Justin_o was just filling me in and we will add the images to github -- we can reassess if we run into issues
2014-05-08T13:46:52 <simonjb> Justin_o: this morning I created a Grunt config for infusion-docs (also sent an email) -- was wondering if you wouldn\'t mind looking over it and seeing if it looks ok? was my first attempt at Grunt -- thanks!
2014-05-08T13:48:39 <Justin_o> simonjb: cool, saw the e-mail.. i\'d be happy to look it over
2014-05-08T13:49:09 <simonjb> Justin_o: awesome
2014-05-08T13:49:14 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I thought I had filed that UIO issue we discussed, but I couldn\'t find it, so I created a new JIRA: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5366  I made it a blocker for 1.5, but we should probably discuss that.
2014-05-08T13:49:49 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks for that
2014-05-08T13:51:00 <Justin_o> simonjb: is the purpose of the grunt task to make it possible to verify the generated output of the md file before uploading it to github, or is to convert the md files to html files that should be used.. i\'m guessing from your e-mail that it is the former?
2014-05-08T13:51:44 <simonjb> Justin_o: for now the former, in the future potentially the later depending on deployment strategy
2014-05-08T13:53:28 <Justin_o> simonjb: right.. if we use a static site generator we\'d probably get this from there anyways... okay.. so in terms of using this for preview/testing.. you may want to also include a clean up tasks in your script
2014-05-08T13:54:08 <Justin_o> the grunt-contrib-clean plugin can be used for this
2014-05-08T13:56:44 <simonjb> Justin_o: good idea on the clean up, I\'ll have a look at grunt-contrib-clean
2014-05-08T14:00:08 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks.. otherwise the script looks good, you\'ll probably want to put a copyright at the top too
2014-05-08T14:00:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: in terms of the generated files, the tables aren\'t rendering out very pretty. I\'m assuming it\'s for lack of css
2014-05-08T14:01:14 <simonjb> Justin_o: yeah, I would think so
2014-05-08T14:02:11 <simonjb> Justin_o: this is just HTML generation, there is some minimal CSS included in the generated files, but it\'s very minimal
2014-05-08T14:02:19 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess that\'s the unfortunate part is that it doesn\'t include the github style sheets for these, so you don\'t get the full effect
2014-05-08T14:02:37 <Justin_o> simonjb: but in terms of structure it looks good
2014-05-08T14:03:00 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks for your comments, I\'ll add the clean task and a copyright
2014-05-08T14:03:23 <Justin_o> simonjb: np
2014-05-08T14:44:45 <anastasiac> Justin_o, you\'re workng on FLUID-5335, right?
2014-05-08T14:45:15 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i was, but mostly just at the uploader part, did you want to pick up the rest?
2014-05-08T14:45:34 <anastasiac> no, I\'m just looking at jiras and that one is unassigned and not \'in progress\'
2014-05-08T14:45:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: oh, oops :)
2014-05-08T14:47:06 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. i\'ve updated that one, and also FLUID-4036 which should have been needs commit
2014-05-08T14:49:48 <anastasiac> :-)
