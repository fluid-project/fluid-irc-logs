2014-01-09T22:49:00 <avtar> kasparnet: yzen and i just made the necessary changes to flowmanager.gpii.net
2014-01-09T22:49:36 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-01-09T22:49:58 <avtar> colin mentioned that you have a repository that contains a bunch of json docs which should replace the preference sets for preferences.gpii.net
2014-01-09T22:50:30 <Bosmon> avtar - who has such a repository!
2014-01-09T22:50:37 <avtar> kasparnet
2014-01-09T22:50:42 <michelled> I wonder if they mean this pull request? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/181
2014-01-09T22:50:43 <avtar> i was told
2014-01-09T22:50:45 <Bosmon> Amazing
2014-01-09T22:50:49 <Bosmon> Where is it, and what is in it
2014-01-09T22:51:00 * jessm has quit
2014-01-09T22:51:08 <avtar> the first question i can't answer
2014-01-09T22:51:48 <avtar> regarding what's in it, preference sets with the new format that yzen was raving about
2014-01-09T22:52:11 <avtar> colin said those should replace what's in the current preferences server
2014-01-09T22:52:27 * vjoanna has quit
2014-01-09T22:52:52 * yzen has quit
2014-01-09T22:53:00 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-01-09T22:53:23 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: thanks. I think solving either or would allow us to keep going. Thanks for the help.
2014-01-09T22:54:04 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-01-09T22:55:06 <kasparnet> avtar: yeah - what should go into the preferences server is the content of the universal/testData/preferences folder -- sec., let me dig up a link
2014-01-09T22:55:09 * vjoanna has quit
2014-01-09T22:55:21 <kasparnet> all these: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/preferences
2014-01-09T22:55:28 * anastasiac has quit
2014-01-09T22:55:46 <kasparnet> but it should also include the ones from this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/181
2014-01-09T22:56:52 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-01-09T22:56:55 <avtar> ok
2014-01-09T22:57:12 <avtar> so just to confirm
2014-01-09T22:57:19 <michelled> kasparnet: who is on tap to review 181?
2014-01-09T22:57:22 <kasparnet> I guess it might be easiest to just take the list from my branch: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-383/testData/preferences
2014-01-09T22:57:32 <michelled> I wonder if an updated pull request battle list needs to be sent out
2014-01-09T22:58:03 <michelled> kasparnet: I think we wanted to avoid using arbitrary branches at this point
2014-01-09T22:58:22 <avtar> kasparnet: the sets served by preferences.gpii.net should be deleted, the sets in universal should be redeployed, along with the ones from the pull request you just linked to
2014-01-09T22:58:24 <kasparnet> michelled: I'm not sure who would be best to review 181 ... it's gonna be nonsense for most people - as it's very MM specific for some of the NP sets
2014-01-09T22:58:46 <avtar> ok
2014-01-09T22:59:03 <kasparnet> avtar: yeah -- though perhaps they should pass review first (the ones in my branch)
2014-01-09T22:59:05 <michelled> kasparnet: is it one that required multi reviewers?
2014-01-09T23:01:51 <kasparnet> michelled: no, not necessarily
2014-01-09T23:02:15 <kasparnet> michelled: the problem is that it's pretty hard to test
2014-01-09T23:02:30 <kasparnet> for most of the NP sets, one would need the RB and ST MM
2014-01-09T23:02:50 <kasparnet> for the backup sets, it's somewhat easier (though still a pain)
2014-01-09T23:03:08 <kasparnet> basically one would have to go through https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJYRMp8JoJAMGmA7Y-eNMySiCRXgU4Uh3dwB0yp9EQs/edit?pli=1# and check that thing launches as expected
2014-01-09T23:05:15 <kasparnet> but even then, one would need some quite unvailable SP3 applications installed
2014-01-09T23:05:37 <kasparnet> michelled: perhaps this is best done, you and me together, tomorrow during our Meeting of Death\xc2\xae
2014-01-09T23:06:17 <kasparnet> (and perhaps have the merger do a sanity check of the 'code' before merge)

2014-01-09T21:04:20 <Bosmon> Quit making stuff that fails, damn you :)
2014-01-09T21:04:35 <Bosmon> Ok, if one of you can write up a JIRA and make a test case pull, I will try to look at it very quickly
2014-01-09T21:04:43 <Bosmon> I assume this issue belongs in the "very very urgent" pile
2014-01-09T21:05:06 <yzen> Bosmon: so if i rename it into something meaningful would that be considered reasonable ?
2014-01-09T21:05:44 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes, very very urgent
2014-01-09T21:05:58 <Bosmon> yzen - well I guess the issue is, "where is it explained to the users of the system what users they can log on as and what effects they should observe"
2014-01-09T21:06:08 <Bosmon> I mean I guess this is really an issue for kasparnet more than for you
2014-01-09T21:06:09 <kasparnet> Bosmon, Justin_o_: ok, I\'ll do the JIRA and make a pull request with a failing test
2014-01-09T21:06:21 <kasparnet> michelled: will just do ^ and then get back to GPII-75
2014-01-09T21:06:22 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: thanks
2014-01-09T21:06:25 <Bosmon> Everything is an issue for kasparnet today :)
2014-01-09T21:06:46 <Bosmon> kasparnet - so what do you think is the purpose of all the files we have in https://github.com/yzen/universal/tree/e285c7c0bb219f6b143e5374d5f48fb6dfd20c4e/testData/preferences
2014-01-09T21:06:52 <Bosmon> And where do we explain to people what they all do?
2014-01-09T21:07:03 <yzen> sure but as for me, Bosmon , what would you like in terms of this pull request?
2014-01-09T21:07:20 <Bosmon> Well, let\'s get an answer to this question first, and then we will know what to do :)
2014-01-09T21:07:33 <Bosmon> In the meantime you can review https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/449
2014-01-09T21:08:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well - we\'re trying to move to a scheme where NP sets that test an application has that name (eg. easit1.json, easit2.json, maavis1.json, maavis2.json) ... and then we just have the old ones
2014-01-09T21:08:35 <yzen> Bosmon: ok
2014-01-09T21:08:36 <kasparnet> Bosmon: things like "audio.json" are a mystery to me as well :)
2014-01-09T21:08:58 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, so in theory you regard the introduction of this file "input_TestCase12_new.json" as unwelcome : P
2014-01-09T21:09:53 <kasparnet> haha - I do find that slightly confusing yes
2014-01-09T21:10:31 <kasparnet> but test_GPII-XYZ.json would probably be good
2014-01-09T21:11:26 <kasparnet> (if that\'s applicable to your case)
2014-01-09T21:11:46 <Bosmon> kasparnet - the name could be improved - but there still remains the issue of how people know what the files are good for
2014-01-09T21:11:55 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-01-09T21:11:58 <kasparnet> I agree
2014-01-09T21:12:02 <Bosmon> I assume that in theory, the ideal would be to have this added to an acceptance test
2014-01-09T21:12:06 <Bosmon> Do you agree?
2014-01-09T21:12:16 <kasparnet> all the NP sets?
2014-01-09T21:12:36 <Bosmon> Well, let\'s start with this file first
2014-01-09T21:12:39 <Bosmon> And then we can widen the question
2014-01-09T21:20:27 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: I\'ve also filed a jira for the issue with the simple syntax you suggested, and have also submitted an accompanying pull request with a test case
2014-01-09T21:20:27 <Justin_o_> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5247
2014-01-09T21:20:37 <Bosmon> Thank you, Justin_o_
2014-01-09T21:20:48 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: if even this issue is solved i think we can write the needed model transformation
2014-01-09T21:23:21 <kasparnet> Bosmon: in terms of the transformation issue, would the fix be that the schema should be automatically generated on usage of arrayValue?
2014-01-09T21:28:32 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I\'m not sure, you would think that no schema would be needed since the output value should be an array
2014-01-09T21:28:39 <Bosmon> I\'ll have to see what the fix entails when I look at the test case
2014-01-09T21:28:53 <kasparnet> yeah - I guess you got a point

2014-01-09T21:45:06 <kasparnet> I guess my tool is a bit outdated -- at least I\'m getting different results.. still wrong ones though
2014-01-09T21:46:15 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-09T21:56:10 <Bosmon> kasparnet - how do you host it?
2014-01-09T21:56:45 <kasparnet> it was just something I set up on my server during portugal - manually pulling in infusion
2014-01-09T21:56:57 <kasparnet> I should probably set up a cron script
2014-01-09T21:57:05 <Bosmon> Perhaps putting on "github pages" might lead to a way for it to be automatically updated
2014-01-09T21:57:23 <Bosmon> But then again, perhaps it might not : P

2014-01-09T22:02:39 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I feel that I did something completely crazy though -- my head is a destroyed right now -- so it would probably make sense to just check that my test-case is even sensible :)
2014-01-09T22:02:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon: should I do an actual pull request somewhere?
2014-01-09T22:02:56 <Bosmon> kasparnet - is this trying to demonstrate the same issue as Justin_o_\'s FLUID-5247?
2014-01-09T22:03:22 <Bosmon> Good grief
2014-01-09T22:03:28 <Bosmon> Neither of you read a single thing the other wrote :)
2014-01-09T22:03:32 <Bosmon> Let\'s see who made the better JIRA : P
2014-01-09T22:03:37 <kasparnet> lol
2014-01-09T22:03:44 <kasparnet> Bosmon: lets not
2014-01-09T22:03:47 <kasparnet> mine is horrific
2014-01-09T22:04:03 <kasparnet> and I doubt I can compete with the king when it comes to JIRAs
2014-01-09T22:04:14 <Bosmon> Well I think yours actually wins the prize
2014-01-09T22:04:21 <Bosmon> Since Justin_o_\'s JIRA is actually self-contradictory
2014-01-09T22:04:35 <kasparnet> haha yay -- take that Justin_o_ :D
2014-01-09T22:05:22 * jhung has quit
2014-01-09T22:05:37 <Bosmon> His description claims the issue is something to do with keys containing periods, but then his example doesn\'t demonstrate it
2014-01-09T22:07:16 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: ok... looks like I dont win the contest for speed though: " jobara added a commit an hour ago "
2014-01-09T22:07:17 <kasparnet> hehe
2014-01-09T22:10:04 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-01-09T22:10:32 <Bosmon> So kasparnet - rather than duplicating Justin_o_\'s work, whilst we\'re waiting for him to come back, would you like to take a stab at the question above?
2014-01-09T22:11:00 <Bosmon> yzen has committed a file which we would like to know what you would prefer done to it
2014-01-09T22:11:04 <Bosmon> And then, all similar files
2014-01-09T22:11:39 <kasparnet> the NP set question?
2014-01-09T22:12:05 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-01-09T22:12:15 <michelled> Bosmon, kasparnet: Justin_o_ won\'t be back until tomorrow
2014-01-09T22:12:22 <Bosmon> Or more broadly, all of the files in https://github.com/yzen/universal/tree/e285c7c0bb219f6b143e5374d5f48fb6dfd20c4e/testData/preferences
2014-01-09T22:12:42 <Bosmon> It sounds like part of your preferred answer is that "these should be the same thing"
2014-01-09T22:12:59 <Bosmon> But presumably there is some value in the rest of the files, even though it seems in many cases it is now very unclear what exactly it is
2014-01-09T22:13:16 <Bosmon> But we can\'t just have people dumping random junk in here without a plan : P

2014-01-09T22:15:55 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2014-01-09T22:16:24 <kasparnet> well - I think in the longer term, we should have a folder with NP sets used for acceptance testing, a folder for NP sets used for demos, etc
2014-01-09T22:16:32 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-09T22:16:45 <kasparnet> and then handle select the appropriate folder via configs
2014-01-09T22:16:46 <Bosmon> It sounds reasonable to organise this directory better
2014-01-09T22:16:51 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-01-09T22:17:06 <kasparnet> but perhaps we should leave the mess for now
2014-01-09T22:17:13 <Bosmon> Perhaps we shouldn\'t
2014-01-09T22:17:20 <kasparnet> I hate you
2014-01-09T22:17:22 <michelled> maybe we should open a JIRA for it
2014-01-09T22:17:23 <kasparnet> :D
2014-01-09T22:17:25 <Bosmon> Since we have a golden opportunity in this panic to actually get people off their arses :)
2014-01-09T22:17:30 <Bosmon> Perhaps we should DO IT NOW
2014-01-09T22:17:43 <Bosmon> Before the thing slides a further 7 months like that Windows pull request
2014-01-09T22:19:01 <kasparnet> I\'m working 15 hour days and my todo list is still terribly long - and I am really scared to mess with something before the EC review
2014-01-09T22:19:20 <kasparnet> would it be ok if we create a JIRA and set it as fix-for pilots
2014-01-09T22:19:20 <kasparnet> (1 month from now)
2014-01-09T22:19:23 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-09T22:19:26 <Bosmon> I\'m making a JIRA now
2014-01-09T22:19:47 <kasparnet> thanks so much Bosmon -- and sorry for countering actually cleaning up all this overdue stuff
2014-01-09T22:19:57 * colinclark has quit
2014-01-09T22:20:16 <kasparnet> there is a "release" called "Pilot 2" that you can put as fix-for .. that should ensure it\'s on our radar
2014-01-09T22:23:49 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-09T22:24:11 <Bosmon> yzen - do you think you would have time to actually add an acceptance test for this NP set you added, or do we need to push that out?
2014-01-09T22:24:38 * SonicX joined the channel
2014-01-09T22:27:01 <yzen> Bosmon: i do not think we can add it, because we do not actually have a rule based match maker and i am not sure how to fully deploy it in addition to the fact that it\'s not part of universal
2014-01-09T22:27:29 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-09T22:27:36 <Bosmon> I guess this will have to be pushed out "beyond the horizon"
2014-01-09T22:27:46 <kasparnet> michelled: I am trying to review GPII-75, but I\'m getting an error on npm install in universal

2014-01-09T22:31:00 <kasparnet> so retrying
2014-01-09T22:31:35 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yay - it worked!
2014-01-09T22:31:41 <Bosmon> kasparnet - splendido :)
2014-01-09T22:31:47 <Bosmon> As I believe they say in DANEMARK

2014-01-09T22:42:51 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: I won\'t be back till tomorrow but just poking in. The issue I was describing is where the new key contains a "."  That is escaped. You can see in the test case the the left hand side had this. "labrador\\\\.retriever". I haven\'t read kasparnets jira but I would assume its for a different issue.
2014-01-09T22:43:15 <Bosmon> Thanks Justin_o_ - your test case looks good and I am working on it now
2014-01-09T22:43:24 <Bosmon> But I am wondering what kasparnet\'s is about if it isn\'t about this
2014-01-09T22:44:25 <michelled> kasparnet: thanks for pushing 75 for windows
2014-01-09T22:44:30 <michelled> there\'s also one for linux https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/39
2014-01-09T22:45:08 <michelled> note that I haven\'t tested it
2014-01-09T22:47:49 <avtar> kasparnet: i was getting a whack load of 404s with npm as well

2014-01-09T18:59:40 <Bosmon> yzen, kasparnet - I\'ve pushed my fix here https://github.com/amb26/infusion/tree/FLUID-5246
2014-01-09T18:59:50 <Bosmon> But horrifyingly, the github UI for making a pull request appears to be broken
2014-01-09T19:00:01 <Bosmon> But perhaps you can do the review and merge anyway :)
2014-01-09T19:00:29 <Bosmon> At least the compare view is still working

2014-01-09T19:10:10 <kasparnet> Bosmon: sure! Though I dont know much (read: anything) about the internal working of grades in infusion - but I can look over the code the best I can, run the tests, and check that it solves the problem I ran into
2014-01-09T19:10:42 <Bosmon> Well I guess it is mainly for yzen to merge it upstream first
2014-01-09T19:10:49 <Bosmon> And then you can update universal, etc.
2014-01-09T19:14:47 * michelled joined the channel
2014-01-09T19:15:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok - so would I do a first check, then pass on to yzen for merging? or would yura take care of review+merge and then I\'ll do update of references?
2014-01-09T19:15:40 <Bosmon> The latter, I think
2014-01-09T19:16:07 <Bosmon> I mean, the reported issue is clearly resolved, so unless this just goes on to expose a further issue, everything should be ok
2014-01-09T19:16:29 <kasparnet> ok cool, thanks for fixing this so quickly Bosmon
2014-01-09T19:17:04 <Bosmon> Let me know what I should be looking at next

2014-01-09T19:50:36 <Bosmon> ok, stupidly I couldn\'t make the pull request because I wasn\'t actually logged on :)
2014-01-09T19:50:50 <Bosmon> You would think that the UI would simply remove the entire button in that case....

2014-01-09T20:09:10 <Justin_o_> Bosmon, kasparnet: we have some questions about transformations
2014-01-09T20:10:45 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o_
2014-01-09T20:11:06 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: sure
2014-01-09T20:11:56 <Justin_o_> Bosmon, kasparnet: thanks.. so what we want to do is to transform something with a structure like {a: "val"} to {b: [{value: "val"}]
2014-01-09T20:12:13 <Justin_o_> }
2014-01-09T20:12:22 <Justin_o_> sorry, missed the closing bracket there
2014-01-09T20:12:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - so are the keys "b" and "value" fixed?
2014-01-09T20:13:05 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes.. i believe so
2014-01-09T20:14:12 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: really we\'re trying to transform the model used by the prefs editors to one that matches the common terms.. currently when we save we get something that looks like this http://pastie.org/private/etbn769nwpiedkdof7lrq
2014-01-09T20:14:33 <Bosmon> So I imagine in that case something as simple as {b: [{value: "a"}]} might do
2014-01-09T20:14:42 <Bosmon> Depending on exactly how kasparnet implemented the rules for arrays
2014-01-09T20:14:45 <Bosmon> He will have to remind us :)
2014-01-09T20:15:21 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: we do also have cases where "val" needs to be transformed.. for example magnification needs to be scaled

2014-01-09T20:30:46 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: thanks, so tha would work, however.... are new keys are actually url\'s but even though they are escaped.. it\'s causing the output to be objects instead of arrays with keys for the position.. e.g. 0
2014-01-09T20:31:09 <Justin_o_> seems like this is the case for anything that has a . in the new key name.. like "something\\\\.a"
2014-01-09T20:31:24 <kasparnet> Bosmon, Justin_o_: sorry for being unresponsive - in a call - brb
2014-01-09T20:39:03 <michelled> Bosmon: I noticed that yzen has made some updates to his pull request: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/174
2014-01-09T20:39:10 <michelled> could you please take a look at it?
2014-01-09T20:39:23 <michelled> I\'m happy to help test it, if you\'d like

2014-01-09T20:48:23 <kasparnet> Hi Justin_o_
2014-01-09T20:48:27 <kasparnet> was just looking at the transformations
2014-01-09T20:49:10 <kasparnet> the function to make things array is: fluid.transforms.arrayValue  (http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions#To_Array_.28fluid.transforms.arrayValue.29)
2014-01-09T20:49:14 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: ah okay.. thanks.. so the simple syntax that Bosmon recommended would work if it wasn\'t for the escaped dots in our key. So we were looking at the arrayToObject transformer instead, but can\'t get it to work
2014-01-09T20:49:59 <kasparnet> ah - no, that one is a bit more complex
2014-01-09T20:50:46 <kasparnet> (and I keep forget how it\'s working :) )
2014-01-09T20:51:43 * SonicX has quit
2014-01-09T20:52:34 <Bosmon> Hi michelled - I was looking at pull 174 but I can\'t completely understand yzen\'s comment
2014-01-09T20:52:39 <Bosmon> on the file "input_TestCase12_new.json"
2014-01-09T20:52:52 <Bosmon> He has said "This file has an example of expressing a preference for specific type of a match maker. It is not actually used other than when logging the user in and out." - does this make sense to you?
2014-01-09T20:52:54 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: :) okay.. so arrayValue looks helpful.. are we able to transform the value inside of that too
2014-01-09T20:53:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - of course all transformation expressions can cascade
2014-01-09T20:54:06 <Bosmon> One day sgithens will help us design the "transformation expression designer" : P
2014-01-09T20:54:13 <Bosmon> Hopefully, actually one day this year
2014-01-09T20:54:21 <Bosmon> As we begin to embark on the FINAL PROJECT
2014-01-09T20:54:21 <sgithens> Bosmon : TO END ALL DESIGNS!

2014-01-09T20:55:24 <sgithens> my bike is broke, I\'m waiting for my new one to arrive, and the weather/roads are crap
2014-01-09T20:55:40 <Justin_o_> Bosmon, kasparnet: how would i use those transforms with say this {a: 5} to {b: [value: 0.5]}
2014-01-09T20:55:46 <sgithens> campus was closed for 2 days this week
2014-01-09T20:55:54 <Justin_o_> so i\'d need to use the linear scale, but i don\'t see how to cascade those transformations
2014-01-09T20:56:08 <sgithens> 5 houses across the street from me lost power for 3 days, and several ended up with burst water pipes
2014-01-09T20:56:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - you can write a "transform" block anywhere where you write a value
2014-01-09T20:56:12 <sgithens> it\'s been a mess
2014-01-09T20:56:17 <michelled> yzen, good timing - Bosmon was just saying that he needed some clarification on your comment on pull 174
2014-01-09T20:56:21 <Bosmon> Sorry to hear that, GITTHUEN
2014-01-09T20:56:30 <sgithens> THE BLUE HOUSE WAS UNSCATHED!
2014-01-09T20:56:37 <Bosmon> Excellent news
2014-01-09T20:56:42 <sgithens> except for a very very large tree limb that came down
2014-01-09T20:56:50 <sgithens> I\'ll need to deal with it, but it did minimal damage
2014-01-09T20:57:03 <sgithens> colinclark may still have my space station story
2014-01-09T20:57:11 <yzen> Bosmon: what was it that you wanted me to clarify :) ?
2014-01-09T20:57:20 <Bosmon> yzen: "This file has an example of expressing a preference for specific type of a match maker. It is not actually used other than when logging the user in and out."
2014-01-09T20:57:20 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: I would think it should be something like:
2014-01-09T20:57:29 <kasparnet> {
2014-01-09T20:57:29 <kasparnet> "b": {
2014-01-09T20:57:29 <kasparnet> "transform": {
2014-01-09T20:57:30 <kasparnet> "type": "fluid.transforms.arrayValue",
2014-01-09T20:57:32 <kasparnet> "input": {
2014-01-09T20:57:34 <kasparnet> "transform": {
2014-01-09T20:57:36 * sgithens has quit
2014-01-09T20:57:36 <kasparnet> "outputPath": "value",
2014-01-09T20:57:38 <kasparnet> "type": "fluid.transform.linearScale",
2014-01-09T20:57:41 <kasparnet> "valuePath": "display.magnification",
2014-01-09T20:57:42 <kasparnet> "factor": 0.1

2014-01-09T20:57:49 <kasparnet> }
2014-01-09T20:57:51 <kasparnet> }
2014-01-09T20:57:53 <kasparnet> }
2014-01-09T20:57:56 <kasparnet> ugh - sorry about that
2014-01-09T20:57:59 <kasparnet> http://piratepad.net/Qqb35JnkGC
2014-01-09T20:58:00 <colinclark> pastie is very helpful :)
2014-01-09T20:58:00 <Bosmon> So this comment does seem to imply that the file *is* used somehow
2014-01-09T20:58:01 <kasparnet> but it seems there might be an issue
2014-01-09T20:58:03 <Bosmon> That\'s fine, kasparnet
2014-01-09T20:58:12 <Bosmon> But I think you missed off the inputpath
2014-01-09T20:58:20 <Bosmon> Presumably the transform should say "inputPath": "a"
2014-01-09T20:58:39 <kasparnet> ah yes
2014-01-09T20:58:47 <Bosmon> I guess you just copied it from another example
2014-01-09T20:58:48 <kasparnet> but it seems to have difficulties creating things inside an array
2014-01-09T20:59:06 <yzen> Bosmon: sure so it means it can be used as any other item in preferences directory, by trying to login and logout as that user
2014-01-09T20:59:31 <Bosmon> yzen - ok - is this fact documented anywhere?
2014-01-09T21:00:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon, Justin_o_: if you try what I pasted here http://piratepad.net/Qqb35JnkGC it gives an empty array - which I dont believe it should
2014-01-09T21:00:06 <Bosmon> I guess there are lots and lots of such users
2014-01-09T21:00:14 <yzen> Bosmon: so far only 1
2014-01-09T21:00:16 <yzen> that one
2014-01-09T21:00:20 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: :(
2014-01-09T21:00:24 <Justin_o_> i\'ll try it
2014-01-09T21:00:33 <kasparnet> (you can use http://kasper.markus.dk/transformTester/ for a quick test)
2014-01-09T21:00:39 <Bosmon> yzen - well, I mean, the testData/preferences data is filled
2014-01-09T21:00:44 <kasparnet> it seems to have problems with objects inside arrays
2014-01-09T21:00:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet - excellent tool!
2014-01-09T21:01:18 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: thanks for the tool...
2014-01-09T21:01:29 <kasparnet> Bosmon: thanks - except the indentation and tab-usage is horribly frustrating
2014-01-09T21:01:33 <kasparnet> :)
2014-01-09T21:01:45 <Bosmon> yzen - my issue is how the user or anyone is intended to understand the purposes of this file :)
2014-01-09T21:01:46 <Bosmon> https://github.com/yzen/universal/blob/e285c7c0bb219f6b143e5374d5f48fb6dfd20c4e/testData/preferences/input_TestCase12_new.json
2014-01-09T21:01:56 <Bosmon> Its name suggests that it is a test case of some kind
2014-01-09T21:02:04 <Bosmon> But it is unclear what it is a test case for, and in what contexts it should be used
2014-01-09T21:02:18 <Bosmon> And, confusingly, it doesn\'t actually correspond to a test case or any acceptance script that we seem to have
2014-01-09T21:02:30 <yzen> Bosmon: ok i understand the name issue, i put at as is as nick (rule based mm) had it
2014-01-09T21:02:31 <kasparnet> I seem to remember that we somehow needed to specify on what levels we had arrays
2014-01-09T21:02:42 * kasparnet is looking through tests
2014-01-09T21:02:49 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ah, you mean the schema issue?
2014-01-09T21:02:59 <Bosmon> YOu would think that the "arrayValue" transform was perfectly good enough for outputing arrays
2014-01-09T21:03:08 <Bosmon> I mean, it\'s all in the name :)
2014-01-09T21:03:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well - it does output an array
2014-01-09T21:03:24 <kasparnet> the problem is trying do stuff inside the array that fails
2014-01-09T21:03:49 <kasparnet> a simple:
2014-01-09T21:03:53 <kasparnet> {
2014-01-09T21:03:53 <kasparnet> "b": {
2014-01-09T21:03:53 <kasparnet> "transform": {
2014-01-09T21:03:54 <kasparnet> "type": "fluid.transforms.arrayValue",
2014-01-09T21:03:56 <kasparnet> "inputPath": "a"

2014-01-09T14:33:23 <Bosmon> Which I find completely astonishing
2014-01-09T14:33:31 <Bosmon> Just going and looking to see what this all means
2014-01-09T14:37:48 * yzen joined the channel
2014-01-09T14:38:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I think we had it in the pilot branch of olden times - and then it has just been laying there
2014-01-09T14:38:21 <kasparnet> Bosmon: good news is that nothing depends on it (yet) - but there are two pull requests pending that do
2014-01-09T14:43:10 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, I\'m still trying to piece it together
2014-01-09T14:43:28 <Bosmon> It seems we have had the gpii.lifecycleManager.registryResolver for years
2014-01-09T14:43:34 <Bosmon> Can it really be the case that it\'s just never been wired up?
2014-01-09T14:44:08 <Bosmon> I\'m pretty sure it was initially, although using a very bad scheme
2014-01-09T14:44:12 <Bosmon> Was that code just removed at some point?
2014-01-09T14:47:11 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-01-09T14:47:44 <kasparnet> Bosmon: It probably was only ever wired up in the notorious Pilot branch -- and then during the porting of stuff to master the demands block etc never made it across
2014-01-09T14:47:44 <kasparnet> that\'s my best guess at least
2014-01-09T14:50:24 <Bosmon> Well, that doesn\'t quite make sense
2014-01-09T14:50:34 <Bosmon> Since clearly it was invented to BE a "resolver"
2014-01-09T14:50:42 <Bosmon> I mean, we invented resolvers largely for this purpose
2014-01-09T14:51:52 <Bosmon> oh well
2014-01-09T14:52:13 <Bosmon> Hi yzen - I was just looking at the registryResolver together with kasparnet
2014-01-09T14:52:22 <Bosmon> And trying to figure out what on earth happened with this
2014-01-09T14:52:26 <yzen> yes
2014-01-09T14:52:31 <yzen> happened with what ?
2014-01-09T14:52:41 <Bosmon> Well, I can\'t understand how it could be that it was never wired up
2014-01-09T14:53:10 <yzen> i m was about to take a look at the pull
2014-01-09T14:53:19 <Bosmon> But I guess this stuff is just so so old
2014-01-09T14:53:28 <Bosmon> I am looking at this comment now that I put there in the LifecycleManager

2014-01-09T15:03:13 <cindyli> amilchev: you might have known that Justin_o_ and I are combing you and Chris\' work together to comply with the design - http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/PMTandPCP-for2pilots.pdf?version=2&modificationDate=1386791493919&api=v2. in particular to implement the switch in btw PMT and PCP. We wonder which branch has your latest PCP work? adjusters-pilots-2 or frames?
2014-01-09T15:06:57 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2014-01-09T15:07:25 <Bosmon> kasparnet, yzen - as far as I can see, the only thing wrong with pull 42 is that you have failed to apply the base grade "fluid.applyGradeLinkage"
2014-01-09T15:07:39 <Bosmon> Currently the "grade linkage" system is on an "opt-in" basis since it is quite expensive
2014-01-09T15:09:54 <yzen> Bosmon: i thought kasparnet addressed that
2014-01-09T15:12:02 <amilchev> cindyli: hi, right now the PCP frame is in adjuster-pulots-2

2014-01-09T15:14:16 <Bosmon> yzen - you\'re right
2014-01-09T15:14:31 <yzen> ok I\'m going to take a look as well
2014-01-09T15:16:46 <Bosmon> Ah, yzen, kasparnet - the issue is that fluid.applyGradeLinkage is applied to the wrong component
2014-01-09T15:17:02 <Bosmon> It is applied to the "gpii.lifecycleManager.resolver" itself
2014-01-09T15:17:20 <Bosmon> Whereas it should really be applied to the resolverConfig component
2014-01-09T15:18:22 <yzen> yes that was one of them but i think he said that even adding it to standard resolver config
2014-01-09T15:18:34 <yzen> did not work
2014-01-09T15:18:37 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-01-09T15:18:49 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps it didn\'t - but it is currently missing from universal trunk
2014-01-09T15:19:51 <cindyli> got it. thanks, amilchev
2014-01-09T15:20:16 <yzen> Bosmon: ok ill update his/my pulls
2014-01-09T15:22:25 <Bosmon> When you add the linkage grade to the resolverConfig, you can also remove the silly 4-line comment above it :)
2014-01-09T15:22:55 <Bosmon> It might also be good to split "standardResolverConfig" into two, and apply the linkage grade to "resolverConfig" in a base grade

2014-01-09T15:26:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon, yzen: sorry - was afk didnt see comments till now
2014-01-09T15:26:32 <yzen> kasparnet: Bosmon i updated 115 for universal https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/121/
2014-01-09T15:32:23 <yzen> yo kasparnet i know why it doesn\'t work
2014-01-09T15:42:03 <amilchev> cindyli: by the way, small change of branches - the combined adjusters (from the pull request) are still in adjusters-pilots-2, and the PCP frame is now in branch pcp-frame
2014-01-09T15:42:17 <amilchev> just letting you know
2014-01-09T15:42:33 * simonov joined the channel
2014-01-09T15:42:46 <cindyli> thanks, amilchev, do i need to combine them together?
2014-01-09T15:43:36 <amilchev> cindyli: no, the pcp frame contains all adjusters, like here http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/PMTandPCP-for2pilots.pdf?version=2&modificationDate=1386791493919&api=v2
2014-01-09T15:44:59 <cindyli> that\'s great. pcp-frame is the one we should use. thanks, amilchev

2014-01-09T16:05:10 <cindyli> amilchev: the translation in src/shared/frames/messages/de/frames.json is in english, is that what you want?
2014-01-09T16:05:33 <cindyli> same thing with the "more", "less" translation in src/shared/frames/messages/el/frames.json
2014-01-09T16:07:39 <amilchev> cindyli: didn\'t know about that, just used Chris\' files, because I thought he had all the translations
2014-01-09T16:08:21 <amilchev> cindyli: you can use https://github.com/chrispetsos/prefsEditors/tree/frames-pilots-2/src/shared/frames/messages
2014-01-09T16:08:29 <amilchev> sorry about that
2014-01-09T16:08:47 <cindyli> no problem, thanks, amilchev
2014-01-09T16:16:51 <cindyli> amilchev: I have some conflicts when merging your pcp-frame branch into our combined branch which contains the pull request from Chris for the merged work from you both, especially with frames.css. I wonder if you have time to help solve that conflict?
2014-01-09T16:22:23 <amilchev> cindyli: I was about to leave about an hour ago ... is it possible that I just name the file differently so that the merge is easier and fix that after the EU meeting?
2014-01-09T16:23:06 <cindyli> sounds good, amilchev, if the renaming is not going to affect ur styling
2014-01-09T16:24:54 <amilchev> cindyli: no, I mean if frames.css is named pcpFrames.css, the merge would be successful and the styles still used .. as stupid as that is, sounds fast
2014-01-09T16:26:23 <amilchev> otherwise i won\'t be able to help you with the conflicts unfortunately
2014-01-09T16:28:33 <cindyli> amilchev: cool. i can do the rename if you are leaving
2014-01-09T16:28:59 <amilchev> thanks, cindyli, bye and hope everything\'s in place
2014-01-09T16:29:03 <cindyli> thanks for the help. sorry for keeping u so late. see you tomorrow

2014-01-09T17:21:44 <avtar> ok
2014-01-09T17:23:25 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, yes, almost done.
2014-01-09T17:24:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t seem to have your Skype details?
2014-01-09T17:26:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I am ready when you are, just need to know how to reach you.
2014-01-09T17:28:18 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: i sent you a contact request a few months ago but you never added me :\'(
2014-01-09T17:28:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I am so sorry.

2014-01-09T18:21:04 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: i have a question about the common terms if you are available.
2014-01-09T18:21:42 <kasparnet> sure
2014-01-09T18:21:43 <kasparnet> Justin_o_:
2014-01-09T18:22:46 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: the prefsEditors save their models in a different format than what is in the common terms registry. yzen suggested we transform this when saving/fetching from the preferences server.
2014-01-09T18:23:07 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: yzen said this could be used to get the keys (URI) https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/ISO24751-2/flat.json
2014-01-09T18:23:17 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: however i don\'t know what format the values should be in
2014-01-09T18:23:31 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: would you have something that specifies this?

2014-01-09T18:26:18 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: what format are the prefseditors using?
