b'2014-06-10T22:46:59 <Bosmon> Quotes look better now
2014-06-10T22:47:02 <colinclark> great
2014-06-10T22:47:14 <Bosmon> "I don\'t know"
2014-06-10T22:47:19 <Bosmon> I just picked a name : P
2014-06-10T22:47:27 <Bosmon> I guess we will have a "mass renaming" soon anyway
2014-06-10T22:47:37 <colinclark> :)
2014-06-10T22:47:59 <colinclark> I\'m not criticizing the name
2014-06-10T22:48:04 <colinclark> just noticing things along the way ;)
2014-06-10T22:49:09 <colinclark> but I guess the question is, what is an expander? Presumably, it\'s a particular kind of declaration of a function call that will a) take an arbitrary set of IoC-resolved expressoins and b) return a value
2014-06-10T22:49:21 <Bosmon> Yes well
2014-06-10T22:49:24 <Bosmon> That is what it is now
2014-06-10T22:49:31 <colinclark> What other kinds of constraints do you imagine?
2014-06-10T22:49:39 <Bosmon> You may recall the days when we supported a variety of these things
2014-06-10T22:49:43 <Bosmon> Now we only have one
2014-06-10T22:50:32 <colinclark> yup, I do
2014-06-10T22:50:46 <colinclark> So you don\'t imagine that they will become more constrained in the future
2014-06-10T22:50:49 <colinclark> but in fact the opposite
2014-06-10T22:51:17 <colinclark> that they were more constrainted and have now been boiled down to a declarative form of a function call
2014-06-10T22:51:23 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-06-10T22:52:05 <colinclark> I guess the issue is with finding them "in the wilds"
2014-06-10T22:52:23 <colinclark> i.e. nested in the midst of a tree of arbitrary JSON
2014-06-10T22:52:39 <colinclark> presumably a structure of the form { expander: { } } is sufficiently rare
2014-06-10T22:53:21 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-06-10T22:53:28 <Bosmon> That issue sort of goes away in the condensed form
2014-06-10T22:53:34 <Bosmon> Enabling the use, presumably, of shorter words
2014-06-10T22:53:36 <colinclark> right

2014-06-10T22:29:19 <colinclark> Hey Bosmon
2014-06-10T22:29:26 <colinclark> Can I ask you a few random Infusion questions?
2014-06-10T22:29:30 <Bosmon> Hey colinclark
2014-06-10T22:29:30 <Bosmon> Sure
2014-06-10T22:29:38 <colinclark> I was doing some coding this weekend
2014-06-10T22:29:43 <colinclark> adding MIDI support to Flocking
2014-06-10T22:29:50 <colinclark> and I had a particular design that was somewhat awkward
2014-06-10T22:29:54 <colinclark> I ended up simplifying it a lot
2014-06-10T22:30:05 <colinclark> but at the time, I had a component that was created on a particular event
2014-06-10T22:30:22 <colinclark> and it was the kind of event that represented a sort of \xe2\x80\x9csetup of the world\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-06-10T22:30:30 <colinclark> such that it could be fired periodically
2014-06-10T22:30:35 <colinclark> so I made this component a dynamic component
2014-06-10T22:30:46 <colinclark> it held two bits of not-so-modelish state
2014-06-10T22:30:59 <colinclark> objects passed to me from the Web MIDI API
2014-06-10T22:31:16 <colinclark> I attempted to bind them via an arguments expression to member variables in the component
2014-06-10T22:31:19 <colinclark> so I had a block like
2014-06-10T22:31:37 <colinclark> members: { midiPorts: \xe2\x80\x9c{arguments}.0.ports\xe2\x80\x9d }
2014-06-10T22:31:52 <colinclark> I found that, in practice, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this
2014-06-10T22:32:11 <colinclark> For a dynamic component, the arguments expression was out of scope inside a members block
2014-06-10T22:32:27 <colinclark> actually, I think to be very specific, it was nested in an expander block
2014-06-10T22:32:47 <colinclark> so members: midiPorts: \xe2\x80\x9c@expand:doSomethingWithPorts({arguments.0})\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-06-10T22:33:00 <Bosmon> That\'s correct, yes
2014-06-10T22:33:08 <Bosmon> The arguments can only be addressed from within a listeners block
2014-06-10T22:33:14 <colinclark> hmm
2014-06-10T22:33:19 <colinclark> For a dynamic component?
2014-06-10T22:33:36 <Bosmon> Oh, a dynamic component initialised from an event?
2014-06-10T22:33:38 <colinclark> yes
2014-06-10T22:33:39 <colinclark> exactly
2014-06-10T22:33:49 <Bosmon> ok
2014-06-10T22:33:50 <colinclark> sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m not being very clear :)
2014-06-10T22:33:55 <colinclark> Should it have worked?
2014-06-10T22:34:03 <colinclark> As I say, I ended up simplifying my design and not needing it
2014-06-10T22:34:25 <colinclark> but I was curious if it was a bug, or if I was understanding how dynamic components were scoped
2014-06-10T22:34:32 <colinclark> I found that something like this did work:
2014-06-10T22:34:35 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-06-10T22:35:20 <colinclark> { members: { ports: \xe2\x80\x9c{that}.options.ports\xe2\x80\x9d }, ports: \xe2\x80\x9c@expand:doSomethingWithPorts({arguments}.0) }
2014-06-10T22:35:30 <Bosmon> That should actually work
2014-06-10T22:35:37 <colinclark> i.e. that I could make a reference to {arguments} in ordinary options material
2014-06-10T22:35:42 <colinclark> but not inside a members block
2014-06-10T22:35:47 <Bosmon> Although you have an error in the 2nd piece of configuration you pasted, which I\'m not sure if it was in the original
2014-06-10T22:35:56 <Bosmon> You had written {arguments.0} rather than {arguments}.0
2014-06-10T22:35:59 <colinclark> oh yes
2014-06-10T22:36:03 <colinclark> sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m just typing freehand :)
2014-06-10T22:36:08 <Bosmon> ok
2014-06-10T22:36:18 <Bosmon> There shouldn\'t be any special treatment for material in the members block
2014-06-10T22:36:23 <colinclark> Ok
2014-06-10T22:36:29 <colinclark> I will try to whip up a test case that shows this
2014-06-10T22:36:35 <Bosmon> That would be brilliant, thanks
2014-06-10T22:37:39 <colinclark> I made this demo last night to show people how to use Flocking\xe2\x80\x99s new MIDI support, Bosmon:
2014-06-10T22:37:40 <colinclark> https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/f823a4111f01cd9bfad4
2014-06-10T22:37:50 <colinclark> First of all, I have to say \xe2\x80\x9cI surrender\xe2\x80\x99
2014-06-10T22:37:56 <colinclark> I had all these monsters:
2014-06-10T22:38:12 <colinclark> { expander: { funcName: \xe2\x80\x9cfoo.bar\xe2\x80\x9d, args: [\xe2\x80\x9cbaz\xe2\x80\x9d] } }
2014-06-10T22:38:29 <colinclark> So I used the expression form of expanders for the first time ever
2014-06-10T22:38:45 <Bosmon> yeah yay!
2014-06-10T22:38:50 <Bosmon> Deth to MOSTERS!
2014-06-10T22:38:52 <colinclark> and I looked at it, and realized that it does actually read better
2014-06-10T22:38:58 <colinclark> i.e. is more understandable
2014-06-10T22:39:03 <colinclark> except for one thing
2014-06-10T22:39:07 <Bosmon> aha, what is that
2014-06-10T22:39:14 <colinclark> the word \xe2\x80\x9cexpand\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexpander\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-06-10T22:39:36 <Bosmon> There\'s a lot of strange squares coming in your messages
2014-06-10T22:39:39 <Bosmon> Are you using a new IRC client?
2014-06-10T22:41:18 <colinclark> ?!
2014-06-10T22:41:19 <colinclark> really?
2014-06-10T22:41:20 <colinclark> no, same old client
2014-06-10T22:41:29 <Bosmon> I think it is on all your quotes
2014-06-10T22:41:51 <colinclark> Hmm
2014-06-10T22:41:58 <colinclark> \xe2\x80\x9clike this\xe2\x80\x9d?
2014-06-10T22:42:03 <Bosmon> I think you have something which is encoding them as "smart quotes"
2014-06-10T22:42:07 <colinclark> My client is converting them to smart quotes, yes
2014-06-10T22:42:15 <Bosmon> Since when I paste them into a text buffer I see them show up that way
2014-06-10T22:42:29 <Bosmon> ok so yes
2014-06-10T22:42:34 <Bosmon> About "expand" and "expander"?
2014-06-10T22:42:50 <Bosmon> The fact they are different?
2014-06-10T22:43:40 <colinclark> no
2014-06-10T22:43:51 <colinclark> let\'s try the quotes real quick
2014-06-10T22:43:59 <colinclark> how is "this"?
2014-06-10T22:45:06 <colinclark> I guess the thing about the expanders in this example is that a reader would look at them and say, "well, these are just function calls"
2014-06-10T22:45:29 <colinclark> "Why do I have to write @expand: instead of, say, @call:?"

2014-06-10T14:42:33 <anastasiac> Justin_o, commented on your pull request with a suggestion
2014-06-10T14:43:15 <colinclark> Hey Justin_o, do you have time for a quick question?
2014-06-10T14:43:39 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks i\'ll take a look in a few minutes
2014-06-10T14:43:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2014-06-10T14:44:00 <colinclark> Does the Speak feature of the Exploration Tool work very well?
2014-06-10T14:44:07 <colinclark> I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell if I\xe2\x80\x99m using it wrong or something
2014-06-10T14:44:19 <colinclark> It seems to read the overlay panel just fine if it\xe2\x80\x99s open
2014-06-10T14:44:38 <colinclark> but if I close the overlay panel and then turn on Speak, it just reads \xe2\x80\x9cText to Speech Enabled\xe2\x80\x9d and sits there
2014-06-10T14:44:52 <colinclark> I could have sworn last week it was working for me, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really confused now
2014-06-10T14:45:44 <colinclark> Or is it a known issue in Chrome vs. Firefox?
2014-06-10T14:45:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: not that i can recall
2014-06-10T14:46:07 <colinclark> Real quick, can you try this out for me?
2014-06-10T14:46:08 <colinclark> http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/
2014-06-10T14:46:12 <colinclark> In Firefox and in Chrome
2014-06-10T14:46:15 <colinclark> Try:
2014-06-10T14:46:19 <colinclark> 1. Closing the overlay panel
2014-06-10T14:46:25 <colinclark> 2. Enabling \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak"
2014-06-10T14:46:29 <colinclark> What do you hear in both browsers?
2014-06-10T14:48:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: i get the same thing.. stops in chrome, but if you reload the page it works
2014-06-10T14:48:15 <colinclark> what is it reading when you reload the page?
2014-06-10T14:48:17 <colinclark> The overlay panel?
2014-06-10T14:48:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes
2014-06-10T14:48:31 <colinclark> Ok
2014-06-10T14:48:47 <colinclark> So it looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re broken in what I will call \xe2\x80\x9cWebKit-ish\xe2\x80\x9d browsers
2014-06-10T14:48:57 <colinclark> I have fixed the crashing bug on Safari
2014-06-10T14:49:04 <colinclark> and will prepare a pull request shortly
2014-06-10T14:49:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2014-06-10T14:49:20 <colinclark> but this issue seems to limit the usefulness of the demo, at least
2014-06-10T14:49:34 <colinclark> You don\xe2\x80\x99t, by chance, remember if this worked better before we introduced the overlay panel?
2014-06-10T14:49:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: the text-to-speech is really early on.. there are lots of improvements needed.
2014-06-10T14:50:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: sorry.. i don\'t recall
2014-06-10T14:50:04 <colinclark> Yes, it needs a rewrite
2014-06-10T14:50:33 <colinclark> Client-side TTS engines are now available
2014-06-10T14:51:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: that will be a lot better than needing to have to run a server

2014-06-10T15:30:52 <Justin_o> anastasiac: was this supposed to be on your list of jiras sent to fluid-work http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5387
2014-06-10T15:31:26 <Justin_o> you have a comment there "GIven that this is only in IE8, perhaps we shouldn\'t worry too much about it?"

2014-06-10T15:40:55 <anastasiac> Justin_o, it is on the list. The comment just reflects our comments in the meetings, for consideration
2014-06-10T15:41:28 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, thanks
2014-06-10T15:43:13 <colinclark> Justin_o: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who the most appropriate person to review this is: https://github.com/fluid-project/FestivalTextToSpeechService/pull/1
2014-06-10T15:45:01 * Bosmon joined the channel
2014-06-10T15:45:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not sure either, but thanks for sending the pull request
2014-06-10T15:45:23 <colinclark> Bosmon: It might actually be you
2014-06-10T15:45:37 <colinclark> I just issued this pull request, which fixes a crasher in Safari
2014-06-10T15:45:38 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/FestivalTextToSpeechService/pull/1
2014-06-10T15:45:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: bosmon might have trouble testing with safari
2014-06-10T15:46:16 <colinclark> Does our fancy testing service help with this?
2014-06-10T15:46:20 <colinclark> Saucy?
2014-06-10T15:46:24 <colinclark> Sauce
2014-06-10T15:46:29 <colinclark> Souse
2014-06-10T15:46:33 <colinclark> whatever it\xe2\x80\x99s called, it\xe2\x80\x99s awesome
2014-06-10T15:46:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: sauce labs should provide a safari instance to use..
2014-06-10T15:46:51 <colinclark> cool
2014-06-10T15:46:56 <colinclark> Bosmon: Have you tried it yet?
2014-06-10T15:48:23 <colinclark> Justin_o: One other: https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/68
2014-06-10T15:48:31 <colinclark> It\xe2\x80\x99s not directly related to the issue
2014-06-10T15:48:48 <colinclark> but rather to the more general problem of not properly sending requests and responses to the TTS server
2014-06-10T15:49:42 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure, that makes sense
2014-06-10T15:54:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: could you actually make that last pull request against https://github.com/fluid-project/prefsEditors
2014-06-10T15:54:47 <colinclark> oh ok
2014-06-10T15:54:48 <colinclark> how come?
2014-06-10T15:54:51 <anastasiac> cindyli, I wanted to double-check the changes you made to http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Creating+an+Auxiliary+Schema  You removed the sections that describe the various members that can exist in a  aux schema - any particular reason?
2014-06-10T15:55:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: exploration tool is something that we maintain, so we usually do work for that in our fork and then send a pull request from there to the gpii repo
2014-06-10T15:56:21 <colinclark> Is there any specific reason for that workflow, other than the fact that there are different committers lists?
2014-06-10T15:56:41 <colinclark> In other words, is there an advantage to that two-step workflow rather than, say, Bosmon reviewing it and pushing directly to GPII?
2014-06-10T15:56:56 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m cool either way, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to understand the intention, rather than the habit
2014-06-10T15:56:59 <colinclark> if that makes sense :)
2014-06-10T15:57:37 <Justin_o> colinclark: if he\'s going to do it right away that\'s fine, otherwise we\'ll have to sit on it till it gets merged and we merge from gpii into our instance
2014-06-10T15:57:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: and i believe it\'s our instance that gets built for the daily build site
2014-06-10T15:58:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: so the process is a bit historic in that we had it like that when we were actively working on the exploration tool... and yes the different committers is likely part of the reason
2014-06-10T15:59:11 <cindyli> anastasiac: the information in the removed section was inaccurate. The list on the other page (http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Auxiliary+Schema+for+Preferences+Framework) is correct. So, rather than having the similar information at different places, the section was replaced with the link pointing to another page
2014-06-10T15:59:35 <anastasiac> ok, excellent, cindyli, thanks for the clarification
2014-06-10T15:59:56 <cindyli> np, anastasiac. just noticed one link on that page is broken. fixing it
2014-06-10T16:01:16 <cindyli> fixed, anastasiac
2014-06-10T16:01:32 <cindyli> the link of "top-level members"
2014-06-10T16:01:36 <Bosmon> colinclark - can you remind me which project the TTS fix must be tested in conjunction with?
2014-06-10T16:02:05 <colinclark> Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Exploration Tool, which is part of the prefsEditors repository
2014-06-10T16:02:22 <colinclark> Justin_o and I were just discussing which version of that I should have issued my pull request against
2014-06-10T16:02:33 <colinclark> since there is a fluid-project fork of the GPII \xe2\x80\x9cproject repo\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-06-10T16:02:56 <colinclark> Testing, however, is somewhat complex, Bosmon
2014-06-10T16:03:07 <colinclark> in that the server depends on the Festival command line tools being installed
2014-06-10T16:03:16 <colinclark> which, at least on my Mac, is non-trivial to install
2014-06-10T16:03:27 <colinclark> on Linux, however, most distros have them as easily-installed packages
2014-06-10T16:03:40 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-06-10T16:04:28 <colinclark> So to test, I ended up having to set up the server on Fedora in VMWare using bridged networking
2014-06-10T16:04:37 <colinclark> opening the correct ports in the Fedora firewall
2014-06-10T16:04:40 <colinclark> it was a bit of an ordeal
2014-06-10T16:05:02 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think of what I could do to make it easier for you to test, Bosmon
2014-06-10T16:08:42 <anastasiac> cindyli, just to double-check: Are the other Prefs framework pages, the ones you didn\'t edit, ok? You reviewed them, too?
