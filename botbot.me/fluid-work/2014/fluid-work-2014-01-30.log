b'2014-01-30T21:28:35 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: it basically just assembles a list of file paths representing the set of files
2014-01-30T21:28:42 <Justin_o_> dependencies for a system
2014-01-30T21:28:51 <Bosmon> So nonArrayDependencies is not in fact a test fixture as you said?
2014-01-30T21:29:01 <Bosmon> Is it something that a user of the plugin might use in real life?
2014-01-30T21:29:16 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes.. and it is used as a condition for the test
2014-01-30T21:29:21 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-01-30T21:29:36 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: like in infusion we might do fluid.get(model, root) and test it\'s output
2014-01-30T21:29:44 <Bosmon> So I guess this gets back to the original question, which I should have expressed better -
2014-01-30T21:29:51 <Justin_o_> well.. that argument list isn\'t right, but i hope it gets to the point
2014-01-30T21:29:52 <Bosmon> "What is the use case for the task nonArrayDependencies?"
2014-01-30T21:30:01 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: ah okay
2014-01-30T21:30:44 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: if you look at the dependency file it uses https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5168/test/fixtures/moduleCDependencies.json
2014-01-30T21:31:00 <Justin_o_> you can see that the dependencies key points at string
2014-01-30T21:31:18 <Justin_o_> this is to make sure you can use a string instead of having to do ["moduleA"]
2014-01-30T21:31:18 * anvk has quit
2014-01-30T21:32:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - but the expectation is that having written "moduleA" is in every way equivalent to having written ["moduleA"], right?
2014-01-30T21:33:17 * cindyli1 has quit
2014-01-30T21:33:36 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes
2014-01-30T21:33:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - so why might it be useful for there to be a grunt task exposed which treats them differently?
2014-01-30T21:34:07 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: there isn\'t
2014-01-30T21:34:45 <Bosmon> Ok - so what does the "nonArrayDependencies" task actually do then?
2014-01-30T21:34:49 <Justin_o_> effective what i\'m doing here is equivalent to get(root, "path") and get(root, ["path"]) and testing the output
2014-01-30T21:35:28 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: it\'s not really a task.. the modulefiles is the task.. nonArrayDependencies is the target
2014-01-30T21:35:52 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: all of this is just running the modulefiles tasks under different conditions which are evaluated in the tests
2014-01-30T21:38:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - somehow this is proving hard to understand :)
2014-01-30T21:38:17 <Bosmon> I guess we should go back to the beginning again : P
2014-01-30T21:38:28 <Bosmon> "modulefiles" itself is a task, right?
2014-01-30T21:39:30 <Justin_o_> yes.. it\'s the task the plugin is actually defining
2014-01-30T21:39:50 <Bosmon> When you say "the task"
2014-01-30T21:40:17 <Bosmon> Does it not actually define other tasks such as "test", "default", "write" etc.
2014-01-30T21:41:30 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i\'ll take one step further back and state that https://github.com/fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles is a grunt plugin.. the plugin allows for you to import a specific task, in this case, "modulefiles", into some other gruntfile
2014-01-30T21:41:42 <Bosmon> ok, cool
2014-01-30T21:42:44 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: does that make sense.. so yes, write is also a task, but i guess you can think of it as one that is only used locally to assist with testing modulefiles
2014-01-30T21:42:50 <Bosmon> Ok, so is it correct to say that entries such as "nonArrayDependencies" is in some way a "sample target" for modulefiles?
2014-01-30T21:43:07 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes you can think of it like that
2014-01-30T21:43:30 <Bosmon> Ok - so the grunt.initConfig call on line 17 of your gruntfile
2014-01-30T21:43:51 <Bosmon> Could this be seen as establishing some "defaults" for the tasks that the gruntfile exposes?
2014-01-30T21:44:42 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: not really, these are the configuration for running those tasks.. the top level keys all correspond to tasks
2014-01-30T21:45:08 <Justin_o_> there are ways to pass in command line arguments and other things, but they aren\'t happening here
2014-01-30T21:45:40 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-01-30T21:45:48 <Bosmon> Well, let me try a different tack : P
2014-01-30T21:45:49 <Justin_o_> Bosmon:  here you can see how tasks are loaded from external files, and created locally
2014-01-30T21:45:50 <Justin_o_> https://github.com/fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L97-L113
2014-01-30T21:45:54 <Bosmon> I\'m looking at the documentation you\'ve written
2014-01-30T21:45:57 <Bosmon> Which does look good
2014-01-30T21:46:20 <Bosmon> In the section "Default Options" you have an example, where there is a use of the "modulefiles" task with a target named "all"
2014-01-30T21:46:32 <Bosmon> Does this bear any relationship at all to the similarly named target you have in the Gruntfile?
2014-01-30T21:46:32 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-30T21:47:55 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: not really no.. the targets could be named anything.. they are only related in so much that they are configured the same.. i could have called it "testAllCondition"
2014-01-30T21:48:01 <Justin_o_> or anything else for that matter
2014-01-30T21:49:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - ok, so the exact role of the initConfig call that you have on line 17 of your Gruntfile remains unclear
2014-01-30T21:50:09 <Bosmon> In which situations is this "config" that you set up exposed to users of the plugin?
2014-01-30T21:50:28 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: it isn\'t
2014-01-30T21:50:47 <Justin_o_> a user of the plugin wouldn\'t use this gruntfile at all
2014-01-30T21:50:55 <Bosmon> !!
2014-01-30T21:51:09 <Justin_o_> they would use the task defined in the tasks directory
2014-01-30T21:51:15 <Bosmon> I think it suddently dawns on me
2014-01-30T21:51:22 <Bosmon> This is a gruntfile FOR the plugin
2014-01-30T21:51:25 <Justin_o_> yes
2014-01-30T21:51:27 <Justin_o_> exactly :)
2014-01-30T21:51:28 <Bosmon> Rather than something which defines the plugin
2014-01-30T21:51:33 <Justin_o_> right
2014-01-30T21:53:33 <Bosmon> Ok, I think I somewhat understand now :)
2014-01-30T21:53:37 <Bosmon> Thanks for being so patient with me
2014-01-30T21:54:36 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: :) no problem.. it is a bit of a confusing setup.. it took me a while to write this in the first place trying to sort out all the pieces
2014-01-30T21:55:22 <Bosmon> I think at various times we misunderstood each other by referring to "the modulefiles task"
2014-01-30T21:55:38 <Bosmon> Rather than "the particular invocation of the modulefiles task in the Gruntfile"
2014-01-30T21:55:40 <Justin_o_> yes.. i think so
2014-01-30T21:55:51 <Justin_o_> yes.. that\'s true.. it was unclear
2014-01-30T21:56:02 * yzen joined the channel
2014-01-30T21:56:08 <Justin_o_> sorry about that
2014-01-30T21:56:39 <Bosmon> Well, these things are always hard to talk about, with a new technology
2014-01-30T21:56:53 <Bosmon> When one is unclear about the distinction between "things" and "instances of things"
2014-01-30T21:57:23 <Justin_o_> yes.. i guess that would have been a clearer way to describe them
2014-01-30T21:57:27 * clown has left the channel
2014-01-30T21:57:42 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if there any standard "grunt language" that covers this case
2014-01-30T21:57:54 <Bosmon> "a run of a task" or "an instance of a config" or whatever
2014-01-30T22:00:53 * yzen has quit
2014-01-30T22:01:11 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: not sure.. i originally wrote this pull request about 4 months ago.. so i\'m still trying to refresh my memory on lots of parts :)
2014-01-30T22:01:51 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i\'m heading out now.. let me know if there you think the plugin is good now, and if you have any other questions.. i\'ll try to get to them when i get to a chance.. thanks
2014-01-30T22:02:04 <Bosmon> Cheers Justin_o_ - thanks for chatting about it

b'2014-01-30T16:20:19 <colinclark> anastasiac: where did classChange.js come from?
2014-01-30T16:20:39 <anastasiac> colinclark, it was in the climateChange demo; I think it came from NOAA
2014-01-30T16:20:49 <colinclark> ah--it certainly stands out
2014-01-30T16:20:52 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-30T16:21:02 <anastasiac> yeah, I wasn\'t sure what to do with it
2014-01-30T16:21:19 <anastasiac> I couldn\'t recall if there was a reason why we left it there in the first place
2014-01-30T16:21:37 <Justin_o_> colinclark: they\'d have to update those.. when they pull from the project repo they will have the new branch there
2014-01-30T16:22:21 <colinclark> I guess I don\'t really mind, Justin_o_
2014-01-30T16:22:33 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i guess what i\'m arguing for is about being clear on what our canonical branch is.. and since master carries the connotation of that.. i think it will lead to confusion both to us, and people coming into the project. Especially when they are not in sync
2014-01-30T16:22:35 <colinclark> It\'s interesting to think about the fact that branches in Git really are just free
2014-01-30T16:22:47 <Justin_o_> colinclark: yes.. exactly
2014-01-30T16:22:52 <colinclark> and that it\'s to come to see a branch like "master" as somehow inherently canonical
2014-01-30T16:23:03 <colinclark> the only thing to keep in mind is that gh-pages is an exception to the rule here
2014-01-30T16:23:06 <colinclark> it\'s not free
2014-01-30T16:23:11 <colinclark> it actually means something very specific
2014-01-30T16:23:16 <Justin_o_> colinclark: right in terms of github that is
2014-01-30T16:23:21 <michelled> I don\'t usually care so much about details like this, but I really do feel that the name \'master\' means something useful. interesting that you bring up the NOAA demo
2014-01-30T16:23:29 <michelled> since it\'s actually the type of thing I\'m thinking of
2014-01-30T16:23:36 <michelled> we have a \'demo\' branch in infusion
2014-01-30T16:23:48 <michelled> we were quite careful about pushing to it, but not super careful
2014-01-30T16:24:14 <michelled> if we have other names branches, they don\'t carry the naming convention of \'master\'
2014-01-30T16:24:36 <michelled> I suppose it means a two step review then for the the case I was outlining before.
2014-01-30T16:24:52 <michelled> which is isn\'t necessarily a bad thing
2014-01-30T16:25:39 <Justin_o_> michelled: yes.. no necessarily a bad thing, since we should be careful about what we publish.. also we should be careful about naming our branches.. in hind site a branch called "demo" isn\'t very descriptive.
2014-01-30T16:26:06 <michelled> no, it would probably we named with a JIRA number
2014-01-30T16:26:16 <michelled> which again, changes how we think of it
2014-01-30T16:27:20 <Justin_o_> michelled: that\'s better, but i might want to add something human readable to that, since most contributors may not go and look it up, or know where to.. so i might call it something like FLUID-XXXX-new-site-launch or something like that...

2014-01-30T16:28:00 <Justin_o_> i guess we are both in agreement though that it would have to stay up-to-date with gh-pages branch
2014-01-30T16:28:09 <Justin_o_> where it made sense
2014-01-30T16:28:16 <Justin_o_> well it should merge cleanly
2014-01-30T16:28:29 <michelled> the other thing we\'d need to make clean and train ourselves to remember is that *every* pull request to the ghpages branch is a request to go live
2014-01-30T16:28:50 <Justin_o_> michelled: yes.. no matter what we do, that is something we have to remember
2014-01-30T16:29:14 <michelled> well, the responsibility is slightly different if we go with the two step though

2014-01-30T16:45:42 <Justin_o_> kasparne_: which walkthrough is appropriate for pmt/pcp related unit tests?

2014-01-30T18:08:06 <colinclark> conceptually behind
2014-01-30T18:08:12 <colinclark> content-wise, it should be accurate
2014-01-30T18:08:16 <colinclark> save perhaps for some whitespace
2014-01-30T18:08:17 <Justin_o_> in terms of commits right?

2014-01-30T19:28:28 <anastasiac> excellent, thanks
2014-01-30T19:34:33 <cindyli1> anastasiac: a couple of things regarding ur 5263 jira. 1. the b) section in it, I think you meant for demands blocks; 2. in terms of a), after thinking more about it, it\'s possible to use demands block for the schema version of prefsEditor if to-be-applied component is the builder.
2014-01-30T19:35:19 * SonicX joined the channel
2014-01-30T19:35:35 <anastasiac> cindyli1, not sure I understand your second point. You mean that we could use demands blocks for the builder itself?
2014-01-30T19:35:57 <cindyli1> yes, builder itself is a component too
2014-01-30T19:35:58 <anastasiac> (and thanks for catching the demands/grades mistake)
2014-01-30T19:36:23 <anastasiac> and demands for the builder itself could override the schemas, cindyli1?
2014-01-30T19:36:30 <anastasiac> or augment them?
2014-01-30T19:36:52 <cindyli1> anastasiac: yes, both auxSchema and primarySchema are builder options.
2014-01-30T19:37:23 <anastasiac> ok, thanks, cindyli1, I\'ll update the JIRA description
2014-01-30T19:37:29 <cindyli1> thanks, anastasiac

2014-01-30T20:39:27 <michelled> jessm: I was wondering what you thought about its priority compared to our other work. Justin_o_, are you and avtar currently looking into it?
2014-01-30T20:46:16 <jessm> michelled: well, is it an issue with just that demo version of UIO or of UIO?
2014-01-30T20:46:48 <michelled> it\'s an issue with tts in UIO which showed up with the new version of Safari
2014-01-30T20:48:34 <Justin_o_> michelled, jessm: it\'s an issue with that demo access the tts server we have here
2014-01-30T20:49:11 <Justin_o_> avtar: was going to look to see if it\'s something to do with nginx, i\'m going to try to setup a local festival server to test it on my machine
2014-01-30T20:50:15 <jessm> Justin_o_: will that yield a sense of how costly fixing it might be?
2014-01-30T20:50:23 <jessm> costly in terms of effort and time?
2014-01-30T20:50:41 <Justin_o_> jessm: i don\'t know.. it will help narrow down where the issue is
2014-01-30T20:58:40 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o_, cindyli1 - I\'m just looking over your conversation about the grunt plugin
2014-01-30T20:58:51 <Bosmon> Could you explain the "nonArrayDependencies" option which was added?
2014-01-30T21:00:30 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: thanks for looking.. that one is a unit test
2014-01-30T21:00:36 <Justin_o_> or is for the unit tests.
2014-01-30T21:02:33 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: these are all used for test cases https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5168/Gruntfile.js#L34-L88
2014-01-30T21:05:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - thanks
2014-01-30T21:06:45 <Bosmon> I guess it wasn\'t clear from its naming and position in the directory structure that this file is filled with test cases
2014-01-30T21:06:53 <Bosmon> Do you think there\'s something we could do about that?
2014-01-30T21:18:41 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i replied to your comment on the pull request.. i think this is common practice for a grunt plugin.
2014-01-30T21:18:56 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: here\'s an example from one of the core contributed plugins https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
2014-01-30T21:19:44 <Bosmon> Thanks Justin_o_ - could I ask my question again? : P
2014-01-30T21:19:45 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i think the gruntfiles for plugins are just for running tests, linting, and things like that. the task that you actually create and distribute is in the tasks directory
2014-01-30T21:19:50 <Bosmon> "Do you think there\'s something we can do about this?" : P
2014-01-30T21:20:34 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: :) okay.. not that i can think of at the moment
2014-01-30T21:20:44 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-01-30T21:20:46 * anastasiac has quit
2014-01-30T21:20:51 <Bosmon> Well "I invite you to try to think of something" :)
2014-01-30T21:21:03 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-01-30T21:21:55 <Justin_o_> Bosmon:  the only thing i can think of would be to define the task outside of the grunt file, but you\'d still need to run it in the gruntfile and since all it does is run tests and lint it seems strange..
2014-01-30T21:22:08 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: also gruntfiles have to be at the root
2014-01-30T21:22:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - could we perhaps move some of this material into a separate file, and include it from the root file?
2014-01-30T21:23:00 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: which material would you like to move
2014-01-30T21:23:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - the test cases
2014-01-30T21:24:02 <Bosmon> Actually I\'m completely puzzled, since I see you already have a directory named "test" which includes some test fixtures
2014-01-30T21:24:12 <Bosmon> Could you explain the difference between these and the ones written in the Gruntfile?
2014-01-30T21:24:24 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes.. that\'s exactly right.. the tests are here https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5168/test/modulefiles_test.js
2014-01-30T21:24:53 <Justin_o_> the tasks need to be in the gruntfile to be run
2014-01-30T21:25:03 <Justin_o_> so the test hooks into those
2014-01-30T21:26:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - which things do you mean by "the tasks"?
2014-01-30T21:26:13 <Justin_o_> the tests also have an annoying habit of working with files, which is why i have to write the results out to files and compare contents with expected values
2014-01-30T21:26:20 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-01-30T21:26:52 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes.. i should be more clear about that.. I want to test the modulefiles task, which is the one i created, and i have several targets. the targets represent the various conditions..
2014-01-30T21:27:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - what is the meaning of the "modulefiles task"?
2014-01-30T21:27:28 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5168/Gruntfile.js#L35
2014-01-30T21:27:43 <Bosmon> Yes, I see its definition :)
2014-01-30T21:27:47 <Bosmon> But I am wondering what its meaning is
2014-01-30T21:27:51 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: which corresponds to the actual task https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5168/tasks/modulefiles.js
2014-01-30T21:27:54 <Bosmon> What does it do, and who does it to it for?
2014-01-30T21:28:00 <Bosmon> who does it do it for
2014-01-30T21:28:08 <Justin_o_> so that\'s the whole plugin :)
2014-01-30T21:28:32 <Bosmon> Ok

2014-01-30T15:31:22 <jhung> michelled: I\'ll take a look at that now.
2014-01-30T15:31:32 <michelled> thx jhung
2014-01-30T15:41:25 <jhung> michelled: I submitted a pull request for master https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/4
2014-01-30T15:41:39 <michelled> thanks jhung!
2014-01-30T15:41:44 <jhung> np michelled
2014-01-30T15:45:44 <michelled> anastasiac: am I right that floeproject.org is using gh-pages?
2014-01-30T15:46:04 <anastasiac> yes, michelled
2014-01-30T15:46:09 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/tree/gh-pages
2014-01-30T15:46:32 <michelled> so, with the pull request from jhung - does it need to be merged into master and then pushed to both master and gh-pages?
2014-01-30T15:48:02 <anastasiac> michelled, that\'s a good question. I\'m not sure what the workflow should be when we\'re using gh-pages
2014-01-30T15:48:06 <jhung> my guess is both michelled? If you merge that pull request to master, I\'ll merge it to ghages and submit a pull request for that.
2014-01-30T15:48:37 <michelled> what has the process been so far?
2014-01-30T15:49:18 <anastasiac> well, we\'ve only done this once, michelled :-)
2014-01-30T15:50:06 <michelled> :) were there 2 pulls?
2014-01-30T15:50:37 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/network
2014-01-30T15:51:33 <anastasiac> it looks like we worked off master until we were ready to publish, then merged master into gh-pages, michelled
2014-01-30T15:51:57 <michelled> ok, so I think it\'s the responsibility of the reviewer to push to both places
2014-01-30T15:52:03 <michelled> unless we don\'t want to publlish
2014-01-30T15:52:34 <michelled> so maybe, we should get the person making the pull request to specify on it whether or not to push to ghpages as well
2014-01-30T15:52:41 <michelled> does that seem reasonable?
2014-01-30T15:52:59 <michelled> Justin_o_: your kingly opinion would be useful here too :)
2014-01-30T15:54:26 <anastasiac> seems reasonable to me, I think...
2014-01-30T15:54:48 <Justin_o_> michelled: okay :) I\'ll have to catch up.
2014-01-30T15:56:58 <Justin_o_> anastasiac, michelled: maybe we should drop the master branch
2014-01-30T15:57:06 <Justin_o_> and use gh-pages as master
2014-01-30T15:57:15 <Justin_o_> sorry.. treat it as master
2014-01-30T15:57:20 <michelled> Justin_o_: I think there is a difference between the two branches
2014-01-30T15:57:25 <michelled> CNAME, perhaps?
2014-01-30T15:57:34 <Justin_o_> michelled: what is the difference
2014-01-30T15:57:44 <Justin_o_> i think CNAME only works in gh-pages branch either way
2014-01-30T15:57:49 <Justin_o_> if that\'s what you were worried about
2014-01-30T15:58:41 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-01-30T15:58:56 <michelled> https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/compare/master...gh-pages
2014-01-30T15:59:07 <michelled> yes, it\'s just the CNAME file
2014-01-30T15:59:48 <michelled> colinclark: did you intentionally only put the CNAME file in the gh-pages branch for floeproject.org?
2014-01-30T15:59:52 <michelled> and not in master, that is
2014-01-30T16:01:09 <colinclark> That\'s not quite what happened
2014-01-30T16:01:25 <colinclark> Since, as you can see, master does indeed have the CNAME file: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/tree/master
2014-01-30T16:01:34 <colinclark> What\'s missing are the commits
2014-01-30T16:01:58 <colinclark> Which, yes, I only ended up doing on the gh-pages branch
2014-01-30T16:02:05 <colinclark> since Github was being rather opaque
2014-01-30T16:02:19 <colinclark> so you\'ll see that the difference between the two branches is two commits
2014-01-30T16:02:23 <colinclark> one that removes the CNAME file
2014-01-30T16:02:25 <colinclark> one that puts it back
2014-01-30T16:03:13 <michelled> oh, weird. the github diff shouldn\'t be showing me changes.
2014-01-30T16:03:24 <michelled> at least, I wouldn\'t have expected that.
2014-01-30T16:03:55 <colinclark> I guess it\'s showing you the history
2014-01-30T16:04:03 <colinclark> 1 deletion, one addition
2014-01-30T16:04:29 <colinclark> maybe there\'s whitespace there, I don\'t know?
2014-01-30T16:04:43 <michelled> ah, could be.
2014-01-30T16:04:57 <colinclark> I wonder if it\'s a line break at the end of the file
2014-01-30T16:05:02 <colinclark> Anyway, I probably should have merged my changes from gh-pages back into master, just to avoid confusion like this
2014-01-30T16:05:02 <Justin_o_> michelled, colinclark: are you okay for this repo and ones like it to not have a master branch.. and to treat gh-pages as the canonical one
2014-01-30T16:05:24 <michelled> ok, so Justin_o_\'s suggesting of deleting the master branch and only using gh-pages is possible. I suppose the only issue is whether  we would want to be working on master over several pull requests before pushing changes
2014-01-30T16:05:30 <michelled> I can imagine that might be useful
2014-01-30T16:05:39 <michelled> if we were doing a lot of changes or had several people working
2014-01-30T16:05:39 <colinclark> yeah
2014-01-30T16:05:46 <Justin_o_> michelled: i think that\'s confusing
2014-01-30T16:05:51 <Justin_o_> michelled: in the sense that it\'s called master
2014-01-30T16:06:00 <Justin_o_> michelled: we could have a dev branch for example
2014-01-30T16:06:06 <colinclark> I guess we\'re free to decide what the gh-pages branch "means"
2014-01-30T16:06:17 <colinclark> but presumably it represents a publishing process
2014-01-30T16:06:20 <colinclark> if that makes sense
2014-01-30T16:06:30 <michelled> yes, that\'s what I was thinking.
2014-01-30T16:06:56 <michelled> the idea of \'master\' to me mean stuff we\'ve signed off on and are happy with
2014-01-30T16:07:05 <michelled> \'dev\' doesn\'t quite have the same ring
2014-01-30T16:07:21 <michelled> and the gh-page *could* mean live
2014-01-30T16:07:26 <Justin_o_> michelled: yes.. i guess i don\'t really know why we need two branches at all
2014-01-30T16:07:42 * avtar joined the channel
2014-01-30T16:07:51 <Justin_o_> if master means signed off on, why doesn\'t gh-pages mean this, in terms of this repo
2014-01-30T16:08:13 <michelled> well, I suppose because we don\'t necessarily want to go live every time
2014-01-30T16:08:15 <michelled> do we?
2014-01-30T16:08:22 <Justin_o_> in effect it represents the "master" in terms of it being the version that we expect to be the latest stable
2014-01-30T16:08:34 <colinclark> I guess that you already have some evidence that in practice, I treated gh-pages as if it were "master" already
2014-01-30T16:08:37 <colinclark> in that I didn\'t bother to merge some changes into master
2014-01-30T16:08:39 <Justin_o_> michelled: why not? i guess i\'m not sure why we wouldn\'t
2014-01-30T16:08:50 <colinclark> Justin_o_: Go live every time?
2014-01-30T16:09:14 <colinclark> Maybe you\'ve got three developers collaborating on the next, super cool version of a site?
2014-01-30T16:09:17 <Justin_o_> colinclark: yes, when would we not want to.. if we didn\'t it shouldn\'t be in master either right
2014-01-30T16:09:36 <colinclark> and so you want the benefit of deciding that some version of it is "canonical"
2014-01-30T16:09:36 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i would expect them to work in a branch and when that branch was ready it would go into "master"
2014-01-30T16:09:41 <Justin_o_> same as we do for our other repos
2014-01-30T16:10:03 <michelled> it means we\'d be stuck with whole hog pulls
2014-01-30T16:10:19 <michelled> we couldn\'t have individual pulls for certain pages or functionality
2014-01-30T16:10:44 <Justin_o_> which i guess is the argument for a dev branch
2014-01-30T16:10:44 <michelled> or, we\'d deploy single page updates individually
2014-01-30T16:11:59 <Justin_o_> i guess you are worried about breakage between individual pulls
2014-01-30T16:12:04 <michelled> no
2014-01-30T16:12:06 <Justin_o_> is that the issue michelled ?
2014-01-30T16:12:11 <michelled> I\'m not worried about breakage
2014-01-30T16:12:20 <michelled> I expect a master to be working at all times
2014-01-30T16:12:29 <michelled> I\'m concerned about linking work too deeply
2014-01-30T16:12:58 <michelled> I don\'t think we\'d want to update a single page on a site, for example, just updating the \'projects\' page on the fluidproject.org site and not the rest of the site
2014-01-30T16:13:05 <michelled> but we\'ve already *done* the projects page
2014-01-30T16:13:17 <michelled> and I\'d hate for it to live in a dev branch for the next 2 months
2014-01-30T16:13:25 <Justin_o_> michelled: so you are worried about a rolling update of sorts
2014-01-30T16:13:42 <michelled> yes. one that we\'ve forced upon ourselves
2014-01-30T16:14:09 <michelled> even, for example, getting some final design sign off.
2014-01-30T16:14:25 <Justin_o_> michelled: so my argument here is that master has the connotation of being the latest most stable build, but in terms of this repo that actually is gh-pages
2014-01-30T16:14:25 <michelled> we might be happy with a bunch of stuff, but want to pass it by someone for final tweaks
2014-01-30T16:14:43 <michelled> but the implication is our live public site
2014-01-30T16:14:58 <michelled> so we can\'t make any modifications to the \'master\' in this case unless we want to update our public site
2014-01-30T16:15:12 <Justin_o_> michelled: right so we create a branch called site-redesign, and it sits there till it\'s in, when it\'s done we merge and drop that branch
2014-01-30T16:15:37 <colinclark> ok, so here\'s a question
2014-01-30T16:15:50 <colinclark> Assuming we went with your approach, Justin_o_
2014-01-30T16:16:00 <colinclark> repositories that are hosted on Github Pages all lack a master
2014-01-30T16:16:24 <colinclark> let\'s say, in the future, we decided that GH Pages actually wasn\'t quite the bee\'s knees that we think it currently is
2014-01-30T16:16:33 <colinclark> and we went back to just hosting the repository normally
2014-01-30T16:17:00 <colinclark> would you find it weird to have a beast with no master and only a gh-pages repository?
2014-01-30T16:17:08 <colinclark> and, in fact, would that actually mean something unintended
2014-01-30T16:17:16 <colinclark> i.e. that Github should actually publish the page
2014-01-30T16:17:32 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i don\'t think so.. since you could just then create a master branch from gh-pages, and drop gh-pages
2014-01-30T16:18:00 <colinclark> and would that impact people\'s forks and/or cloned repositories?
