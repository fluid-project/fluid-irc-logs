2014-04-15T14:50:29 <jhung> cindyli - I pushed up changes to my repo. I wonder if we\'re ready to have anastasiac to start integrating the overview panel? I\'ll still be doing styling tweaks though.
2014-04-15T14:51:07 <cindyli> sounds good to integrate the overview panel, jhung
2014-04-15T14:51:21 <cindyli> anastasiac: let me know what i can help with this integration
2014-04-15T14:51:38 <anastasiac> jhung, cindyli, we really do need to have simon\'s branch, with the overview panel in it, merged into master and then have master updated in the metadata demo, no?
2014-04-15T14:52:18 <jhung> anastasiac: was that pull request merged?
2014-04-15T14:52:22 <cindyli> anastasiac: agree. in the meantime, can we build infusion based off simon\'s branch?
2014-04-15T14:52:42 <anastasiac> no, it hasn\'t been merged yet.
2014-04-15T14:53:02 <anastasiac> and yes, we can do a first pass using simon\'s branch - that\'s what I\'m doing for all the demos
2014-04-15T14:53:09 <anastasiac> but we really should get it merged
2014-04-15T14:53:14 <anastasiac> Maybe michelled could do that today
2014-04-15T14:54:25 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess I should check in with Bosmon - last I heard on Thursday was that Simon was making a few little changes to it

2014-04-15T15:08:37 <anastasiac> michelled, when I chatted with Simon on Friday morning, he had made any changes he was going to make. The only outstanding issue was moving the \'test\' page from the component folder into a proper demo in the demos folder, which I\'ll do as part of FLUID-5289

2014-04-15T16:33:03 <karan10> vjoanna: hi, I am working on project "Picture Dictionary". What could be the possible ways to solve the problem for the words that have different meaning, like \'tear\'. I talked about it with justin, and he said to discuss it with you.
2014-04-15T16:33:30 <jhung> cindyli: I just noticed that pressing Enter on the URL input field doesn\'t do anything. I think it should be the same as pressing "Ok" button. What do you think?
2014-04-15T16:34:05 <karan10> vjoanna: Any alternative for these types of words ?
2014-04-15T16:38:44 <vjoanna> karan10: I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to look at other keywords in sentence words are used in that might help? tear drop / tear up
2014-04-15T16:39:48 <cindyli> jhung: agree. will associate the enter key with "OK" button
2014-04-15T16:45:49 <karan10> vjoanna: yes, it is ok, but if the user search for a single word like "mouse", we can display both images with their meanings.
2014-04-15T16:54:14 <vjoanna> karan10: yes, in that case both images would be be displayed
2014-04-15T16:57:00 <karan10> vjoanna: ok, thanks :)

2014-04-15T17:06:01 <jhung> thanks
2014-04-15T17:06:08 <cindyli> working on the last bit ro associate the enter key

2014-04-15T17:06:28 <jhung> ok
2014-04-15T17:19:37 <Bosmon> michelled, anastasiac - if the overview panel can be merged up with master and have the lint task run on it, it can be merged in
2014-04-15T17:20:48 * karan10_ has quit
2014-04-15T17:27:00 <michelled> good to know, Bosmon. I\'ll try to look at it soon.
2014-04-15T17:28:28 <cindyli> jhung: the binding for the enter key is done and pushed up. so all changes u want should be in. Let me know if I missed anything. thanks.
