2014-08-08T13:34:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello
2014-08-08T13:34:49 <Justin_o> i\'m seeing something strange in my test
2014-08-08T13:35:12 <Justin_o> i have a sequence.. at the beginning i simulate a keydown event on the "enter" key.. this worked using the simulate plugin
2014-08-08T13:35:18 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2014-08-08T13:35:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: next i tried to test that the "escape" key works
2014-08-08T13:35:38 <Justin_o> but the test hangs
2014-08-08T13:35:59 <Justin_o> when i put in a log on the my function that runs the simulate, it appears to log the escape event before the enter one
2014-08-08T13:36:05 <Justin_o> any idea why this might happen?
2014-08-08T13:36:39 <Bosmon> Have you tried the effect in another browser?
2014-08-08T13:36:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not yet.. i\'ll try that now
2014-08-08T13:36:53 <Bosmon> I seem to recall that processing of the "Escape" key was historically a little dodgy
2014-08-08T13:37:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: same issue in chrome and firefox
2014-08-08T13:37:42 <Bosmon> The browser does intercept it for some special treatment - at least this used to be the case
2014-08-08T13:37:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh
2014-08-08T13:38:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: was there a work around you found?
2014-08-08T13:39:16 <Bosmon> You can try listening to different combinations of the base events
2014-08-08T13:39:23 <Bosmon> For example, keyup, keydown, keypress, etc.
2014-08-08T13:39:28 <Bosmon> but it would be best to understand what the effect is first
2014-08-08T13:40:46 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-08T13:43:08 <Justin_o> using keyup, keydown, or keypress don\'t work
2014-08-08T13:43:23 <Justin_o> interestingly keydown causes the "enter" keydown event to fire twice
2014-08-08T13:43:44 <Justin_o> but in all case it happens after the "esc" key event which is later in the sequence
2014-08-08T13:44:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i changed the esc to a different key and same issue.. it\'s logging before the earlier event still
2014-08-08T13:45:04 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wMWMzlY6
2014-08-08T13:45:24 <Justin_o> it\'s the sequence from line 182 - 212
2014-08-08T13:45:30 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-08-08T13:45:53 <Justin_o> you can see that the first simulated key event happens on line 183
2014-08-08T13:45:57 <Justin_o> the last on line 207
2014-08-08T13:46:07 <Justin_o> but the one on line 207 is console logging earlier
2014-08-08T13:47:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you mean the logging on line 98?
2014-08-08T13:48:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2014-08-08T13:48:37 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-08-08T13:48:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - why not check for basic sanity and also make sure that the events are actually firing in the right order : P
2014-08-08T13:49:13 <Bosmon> This may be our old friend again of course - in that this entire sequence may currently be happening synchronously
2014-08-08T13:49:29 <Bosmon> Also check the situation with "harmless" keys such as letters ....
2014-08-08T13:49:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the demo works.. i put log statements on the dialogs open and close events
2014-08-08T13:50:11 <Justin_o> in the test, the log for the dialogs open event logs before either of the simulate logs
2014-08-08T13:50:18 <Justin_o> but the close event never happens

2014-08-08T14:07:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the escape binding comes from the jQuery UI Dialog.. i don\'t think i can change that to try with a different key
2014-08-08T14:08:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - welcome to the marvellous world of unconfigurable software :)
2014-08-08T14:09:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: a world full of tears and sorrow
2014-08-08T14:09:30 <Bosmon> So it historically has been
2014-08-08T14:09:40 <Bosmon> What does the escape binding do?
2014-08-08T14:09:52 <Bosmon> Didn\'t you say that if you picked a key other than escape, the strange effect went away?
2014-08-08T14:10:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no, the same effect happened in terms of the logging
2014-08-08T14:10:39 <Justin_o> the escape binding closes the dialog
2014-08-08T14:12:33 <jhung> anastasiac: Do you think we can close FLUID-5476?

2014-08-08T14:23:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: got it working.. turns out i was executing the key event on the wrong DOM element :(
2014-08-08T14:24:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, cool - glad it\'s sorted out :)
2014-08-08T14:24:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for the help

2014-08-08T14:25:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: another question.. can I not have more than one sequence test in a module in the IoC Testing framework
2014-08-08T14:25:13 <Justin_o> ?
2014-08-08T14:26:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you could
2014-08-08T14:26:34 <Justin_o> i\'m finding at the moment that it only runs the first one
2014-08-08T14:26:46 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ayEVLV5y
2014-08-08T14:27:02 <Justin_o> if you look at lines 135 - 220
2014-08-08T14:27:06 <Justin_o> only the first sequence is run
2014-08-08T14:27:13 <Justin_o> no errors in the console

2014-08-08T15:42:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you think we need to test the opening and closing of the tooltip, since this is all done by the tooltip component itself? or should we just make sure that it is created?
2014-08-08T15:42:58 <Justin_o> that the component is created?
2014-08-08T15:43:29 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think testing the latter should be enough
2014-08-08T15:43:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. i\'ll do that for now..
2014-08-08T15:43:43 <Justin_o> thanks
2014-08-08T15:44:01 <cindyli> np
2014-08-08T15:48:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, tests are done.. i\'m going to try to fix up the last oddities of the tooltip in feedback now
2014-08-08T15:48:57 <cindyli> cool!

2014-08-08T16:06:41 <anastasiac> jhung, sorry I missed your question about FLUID-5476. Yes, I suspect we can close that. We might still add more content, but we could add it directly
2014-08-08T16:11:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: i submitted a pull request for FLOE-160 - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/32. can you review it when you have time?
