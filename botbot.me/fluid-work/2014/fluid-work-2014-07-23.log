b'2014-07-23T19:59:21 <Bosmon> sorry :(
2014-07-23T19:59:25 <Bosmon> What were you working on?
2014-07-23T19:59:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem.. for the most part we were talking through the designs for the documentation site http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/327842/fluidproject-infusiondocs.pdf?api=v2
2014-07-23T20:00:23 <Justin_o> there were some questions that came up about branding.. is this fluid docs or infusion docs specifically.. so there might need to be some more work in that area, as well as representing different versions of the docs
2014-07-23T20:00:52 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-07-23T20:00:55 <Bosmon> cool
2014-07-23T20:01:00 <Bosmon> The designs look great
2014-07-23T20:01:07 <Bosmon> If only we could make tables that look as good as those : P
2014-07-23T20:01:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully we\'ll be able to :) it\'s a pretty high bar
2014-07-23T20:01:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: scroll down and check out the responsive table
2014-07-23T20:02:06 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-07-23T20:02:11 <Bosmon> Remarkable, isn\'t it : P
2014-07-23T20:02:17 <Bosmon> Do we have any candidate techniques for generating that?
2014-07-23T20:02:45 <Justin_o> there are some examples on this site http://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/
2014-07-23T20:02:57 <Justin_o> here\'s a demo http://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php
2014-07-23T20:03:58 <Bosmon> The technique seems a bit prohibitive
2014-07-23T20:04:13 <Bosmon> Apparently requiring us to render table-specific CSS....
2014-07-23T20:04:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what do you mean by table-specific css
2014-07-23T20:05:08 <Justin_o> do you mean <table> or do you mean each individual table needs specific css
2014-07-23T20:05:12 <Bosmon> I mean the latter
2014-07-23T20:05:18 <Justin_o> ah that sucks
2014-07-23T20:05:29 <simonjb> colinclark: sorry this is 3 hours late but I just saw your question about https://code.google.com/p/gyp/wiki/GypVsCMake -- I don\'t know GYP well enough yet to have an opinion
2014-07-23T20:06:17 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'m glad that you brought it up though -- I was think of CMake as I had had good experience with it
2014-07-23T20:07:24 <Justin_o> vjoanna, Bosmon: what do you think about this responsive table http://zurb.com/playground/projects/responsive-tables/index.html
2014-07-23T20:07:36 <simonjb> colinclark: but if GYP will work for us, it might be nice to reuse a technology that is used elsewhere (such as with node-gyp to build node-ffi)
2014-07-23T20:08:03 <clown> jhernandez:  if your email hasn\'t pinged you yet, I just pushed the latest changes to the nodepackagekit code and unit tests (now with "arch" support!).
2014-07-23T20:08:04 <simonjb> colinclark: worth considering anyway
2014-07-23T20:10:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t think the JS-based layout will play very well with a genuine mobile device
2014-07-23T20:10:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s another one http://filamentgroup.github.io/tablesaw/demo/stack.html
2014-07-23T20:11:06 <Justin_o> but it might just be the same as the first
2014-07-23T20:11:43 <Bosmon> At least this lot didn\'t minify their JS
2014-07-23T20:11:51 <Bosmon> Implying that they actually might want someone to use it : P
2014-07-23T20:12:10 <Justin_o> https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw
2014-07-23T20:12:14 <Justin_o> that\'s the code
2014-07-23T20:12:53 <Justin_o> the repo seems quite big but i haven\'t look at it in detail yet
2014-07-23T20:13:03 <Justin_o> anyways.. let us know what you think.. i have to run now though..
2014-07-23T20:22:09 <colinclark> simonjb: yup, worth considering
2014-07-23T20:22:16 <colinclark> i am no expert in this area, so you\'re the boss
2014-07-23T20:22:37 <colinclark> And I\'m also fine with the justification that we should use cmake because you can work quickly with it
2014-07-23T20:22:41 <colinclark> whatever you think is best
2014-07-23T20:23:50 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-07-23T20:24:51 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'ll do some looking at gyp and then discuss my thoughts with everyone
2014-07-23T20:25:54 <colinclark> sounds sensible
2014-07-23T20:27:30 * cindyli has quit
2014-07-23T20:28:56 <simonjb> colinclark: one factor which might be an important one is the support for MinGW tooling on Windows -- am I right in thinking that this is pretty important for GPII? I will investigate more but initially it looks like gyp support for MinGW may be limited (more focused on VS)
2014-07-23T20:32:27 <colinclark> yeah that\'s a good point, simonjb
2014-07-23T20:32:40 <colinclark> mingw in itself, I don\'t think, is important for to the GPII
2014-07-23T20:33:10 <colinclark> what is important is that anyone can easily build our stuff
2014-07-23T20:33:11 * anvk has quit
2014-07-23T20:33:13 <colinclark> or contribute to it
2014-07-23T20:33:39 <colinclark> If we knew, for example, that Microsoft\'s toolchain would allow them to do so, then they\'re fine
2014-07-23T20:34:00 <colinclark> I guess we settled on mingw initially because we knew it was a free toolchain
2014-07-23T20:35:37 <simonjb> colinclark: ok, that makes sense, VS C++ Express is _currently_ freely available (and has been for a while) but it\'s certainly not free software in the FSF sense of the word
2014-07-23T20:42:04 <colinclark> I don\'t think we\'re tied to the FSF sense of openness
2014-07-23T20:42:12 <colinclark> otherwise I guess we wouldn\'t be developing on Windows at all :)
2014-07-23T20:42:29 <colinclark> I do want to balance an "idiomatic" experience for windows development
2014-07-23T20:42:56 <colinclark> with confidence that our tools will be easily automatable and won\'t suddenly become available
2014-07-23T20:43:10 <colinclark> i can\'t imagine MS is going to make VS umavailable
2014-07-23T20:43:24 <colinclark> and to be honest if we\'re considering gyp or cmake, using the VS tools becomes more appealing
2014-07-23T20:43:30 <colinclark> since we can generate project files and the like
2014-07-23T20:45:58 <simonjb> it does seem unlikely that VS Express will go away but it\'s something we maybe need to consider -- for example when
2014-07-23T20:46:37 <simonjb> the VS 2012 Express versions were released, there was no Express version for building desktop apps -- only Metro apps
2014-07-23T20:47:04 <simonjb> MS initially planned on requiring you to but the full VS to build "legacy" apps
2014-07-23T20:47:19 <simonjb> they since changed their policy

b'2014-07-23T13:59:28 <Bosmon> Based on inspecting the system load, and waiting for it to go down :)
2014-07-23T14:00:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - lets
2014-07-23T14:01:07 <simonjb> michelled: it is looking like the unreliability of our acceptance tests is causing difficulty in assessing my pull request for the 0.10.29 updates -- can we table a discussion at the arch meeting today?
2014-07-23T14:06:03 <simonjb> michelled: meaning can we discuss it? (looks like "table a discussion" has opposite meanings in the UK and the US! I\'m not sure about the interpretation in Canada http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/16285/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-expression-we-can-table-this)
2014-07-23T14:08:16 <michelled> hehe - sounds good simonjb

2014-07-23T14:46:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, that was fast.. i\'ll take a look at it after i get FLOE-204 cleaned up a bit mroe
2014-07-23T14:46:39 <cindyli> sure. thanks, Justin_o
2014-07-23T15:06:51 <Bosmon> "There isn\'t a chair - there\'s only a rock"
2014-07-23T15:12:30 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'m seeing similar behaviour to you I think. I just did 20 runs of my changes with 0.10.29 and 20 runs of GPII master with 0.8.25: my code passed 9/20, master passed 14/20
2014-07-23T15:13:21 <simonjb> it\'s looking like we are seeing more failures
2014-07-23T15:13:39 <Bosmon> simonjb - thanks for being so thorough
2014-07-23T15:13:52 <Bosmon> I\'ll try to do 20 here when I get a moment
2014-07-23T15:14:08 <simonjb> ok, great
2014-07-23T15:14:29 <Bosmon> It\'s surprising how weak "tests for equality of binomial proportions" are : P
2014-07-23T15:14:35 <Bosmon> But then SCIENCE was always a very shaky proposition
2014-07-23T15:15:13 <simonjb> :)
2014-07-23T15:15:28 <Bosmon> It\'s interesting that even on your machine we can say that there was evidence for a shift from "mostly passing" to "mostly failing"
2014-07-23T15:15:49 <simonjb> yes, that is what it looks like
2014-07-23T15:24:17 <simonjb> Bosmon: this is an interesting detail: 5 of what I counted as failures for my 0.10.29 runs were of the "PASS 6/6" kind -- I only counted 18/18 as real passes -- but for 0.8.25, I saw no 6/6, only 16/18, 17/18 and 18/18
2014-07-23T15:26:00 <simonjb> Bosmon: 20 runs is still not a huge sample size but given that 1/4 of the runs were 6/6 for 0.10.29, I would have expected to see some in 0.8.25, if the system was behaving in a similar manner
2014-07-23T15:26:05 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, there seems that there is definite evidence that several different race sequences are possible in 0.10 compared to 0.8 .....
2014-07-23T15:27:03 <Bosmon> We do actually have a "debounce" timer in the core testing framework that terminates a test run if no further tests arrive after 100 ms
2014-07-23T15:27:04 <simonjb> yes, it is looking like that
2014-07-23T15:27:12 <Bosmon> Which is my best guess as to why some of the runs are being curtailed
2014-07-23T15:27:23 <simonjb> interesting
2014-07-23T15:27:58 <Bosmon> But it seems puzzling what the system could be doing that leads it not to be able to execute a function directly following in the same file for 100ms ........
2014-07-23T15:28:13 <Bosmon> It seems clear that 0.10 has new and different ways of being "busy" compared to 0.8
2014-07-23T15:28:40 <simonjb> did we see anything similar on 0.10 on Linux?
2014-07-23T15:28:47 <Bosmon> no
2014-07-23T15:29:03 <Bosmon> Our Linux tests have been completely deterministic to my experience
2014-07-23T15:29:30 <Bosmon> But they are helped by the fact that all of our means for settings application on Linux are synchronous
2014-07-23T15:29:33 <clown> hey jhernandez!
2014-07-23T15:29:52 <Bosmon> They all involve either issuing gsettings calls (which are AFAIK synchronous) or rewriting files

2014-07-23T15:41:50 <jhung> michelled: let me know when you want to sync up.

2014-07-23T15:57:08 <clown> and, now I guess I\'m modifying the c++ code too.  Cool!
2014-07-23T15:57:20 <jhernandez> hehehe
2014-07-23T15:57:33 <clown> but, \xe2\x80\xa6 three minutes to arch meeting (there is one today, right?)

2014-07-23T15:58:51 <clown> in a number of functions.  That makes me want to create a private static function that makes the package, that can be used in all those places in the c++ code.
2014-07-23T15:59:07 <clown> right 1 min 30 sec jhernandez.

2014-07-23T16:01:23 <Bosmon> Inverse later...
2014-07-23T16:01:27 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'ll try to get those mods done after the meeting and send another patch to that pull request by end of day (it shouldn\'t take too long).
2014-07-23T16:01:41 <cindyli> YAY!

2014-07-23T18:23:22 <Bosmon> Hello clown
2014-07-23T18:23:35 <clown> is the convention that the msg is what is printed if the test fails?  Or is it just a "running test such-and-so" message.

2014-07-23T18:24:33 <clown> hi Bosmon.
2014-07-23T18:24:35 <Bosmon> clown - the exact semantics of what the framework actually does are governed by the underlying QUnit implementation
2014-07-23T18:24:39 <Bosmon> For example, http://api.qunitjs.com/ok/
2014-07-23T18:25:26 <clown> alas, that is not very helpful:  "A short description of the assertion".  Although that suggests it\'s just "running test such-and-so".
2014-07-23T18:28:30 <clown> althought it earlier says:  "equivalent to \xe2\x80\xa6 JUnit\'s assertTrue()."
2014-07-23T18:28:55 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: please let me know if you\'d like to join the community meeting remotely today. We\'ll be continuing working on the Infusion docs.
2014-07-23T18:29:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I should be able to join later
2014-07-23T18:29:09 <Bosmon> I need to run out for a bit
2014-07-23T18:29:19 <clown> and for JUnit assertTrue(msg, boolean) , the msg *is* what to relay on failure.
2014-07-23T18:29:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. please ping me if / when you are free
2014-07-23T18:30:09 <clown> okay Bosmon, don\'t let me keep you.  Thanks for the info.
2014-07-23T18:30:18 <Bosmon> clown - the distinction only seems strongly relevant from a procedural, rather than a declarative standpoint : P
2014-07-23T18:30:26 <Bosmon> The purpose of the message is to identify the assertion
2014-07-23T18:30:39 <Bosmon> What the framework actually does with it is its own affair : P
2014-07-23T18:31:22 <Bosmon> One day, we will dream of having tests that are 100% declarative
2014-07-23T18:31:35 <Bosmon> And there are plenty of other things one could do with tests rather than actually run them....
2014-07-23T18:32:14 <clown> swear at them?
2014-07-23T18:32:38 <clown> well, let me try this:  what to you do for the msg arg, assuming you have written a test?
2014-07-23T18:36:26 <Justin_o> cindyli, simonjb, danaayotte_: I\'m setting up the community meeting in the colab room

b'2014-07-23T10:45:44 <jhernandez> is that correct? or it\'s my disability when checking out branches? :P
2014-07-23T10:45:59 <Bosmon> So go into universal/tests/acceptanceTests
2014-07-23T10:46:12 <Bosmon> and run node AcceptanceTests_gnome_keyboard.js
2014-07-23T10:46:16 <Bosmon> And see what happens
2014-07-23T10:47:14 <jhernandez> same error, and I end up with a "http://registry. .... [output suppressed at 1024 chars - for more output, increase fluid.logObjectRenderChars]
2014-07-23T10:47:22 <Bosmon> !!!!!!
2014-07-23T10:47:33 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-07-23T10:48:17 <Bosmon> Type pwd in that directory.........
2014-07-23T10:48:20 <Bosmon> What does it say!
2014-07-23T10:48:28 <jhernandez> /home/jhernandez/drafts/GPII-873/node_modules/universal/tests/acceptanceTests
2014-07-23T10:50:24 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:50:31 <Bosmon> Can you paste 100% of the logs into a pastie....
2014-07-23T10:50:46 <Bosmon> Showing the command line before and after
2014-07-23T10:51:21 <jhernandez> yeah, sure
2014-07-23T10:53:03 <jhernandez> http://pastie.org/private/rvcng6khopc51zclabw
2014-07-23T10:53:05 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2014-07-23T10:54:44 <jhernandez> btw, looks like the copy of infusion is right:
2014-07-23T10:54:49 <jhernandez> "_resolved": "git://github.com/amb26/infusion.git#aaaf47c904021bcc551068f8dff9a8c6df3d3b5b", "_from": "infusion@git://github.com/amb26/infusion.git#aaaf47c904021bcc551068f8dff9a8c6df3d3b5b"
2014-07-23T11:01:10 <Bosmon> The error is impossible....
2014-07-23T11:01:15 <Bosmon> Or else it is being misreported
2014-07-23T11:01:26 <Bosmon> There\'s clearly no attempt to access a property named "events" on that line
2014-07-23T11:02:20 <jhernandez> Bosmon: which version of node.js are you using?
2014-07-23T11:02:45 <jhernandez> v0.11.2 here
2014-07-23T11:03:27 <Bosmon> ugh
2014-07-23T11:03:30 <Bosmon> How did you get that? : P
2014-07-23T11:03:35 <Bosmon> I have 0.10.29
2014-07-23T11:04:12 <Bosmon> Aren\'t the odd-numbered versions for development only?
2014-07-23T11:04:35 <Bosmon> Try with a 0.10.x and I will get a SANGWIDGE....
2014-07-23T11:05:17 * jhung joined the channel
2014-07-23T11:05:20 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-23T11:05:39 <jhernandez> I got it manually
2014-07-23T11:07:02 <jhernandez> not using rpm packages from my distro, in this way, I can easily switch between different versions of node
2014-07-23T11:07:56 <jhernandez> I\'ll try with 0.10.x, which will take a few minutes
2014-07-23T11:09:51 <Bosmon> On Windows, I can easily switch between different versions of node by renaming .exe files : P
2014-07-23T11:11:46 <jhernandez> Bosmon: that isn\'t a valid install procedure!!!
2014-07-23T11:11:47 <jhernandez> :P :P
2014-07-23T11:12:54 <jhernandez> one day I\'ll start using nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
2014-07-23T11:21:11 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-23T11:21:33 <jhernandez> v0.10.5
2014-07-23T11:21:49 <jhernandez> All tests concluded: 62/62 total passed in 3472ms - PASS
2014-07-23T11:26:17 <jhernandez> linux\' builtIn tests still not passing, but got a different error than before
2014-07-23T11:26:43 <jhernandez> I have to walk my dogs
2014-07-23T11:26:57 <jhernandez> I\'ll be back in less than an hour

2014-07-23T12:44:05 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o. let me know if you want me to carry on with FLOE-194, otherwise, i will be starting on FLOE-195
2014-07-23T12:44:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think FLOE-194 is more or less done, except I think there are one or two spots that are still called happy face that need to be changed.. i think they might be in feedback.js
2014-07-23T12:44:52 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-07-23T12:45:18 <cindyli> i can change that, Justin_o. have you pushed up FLOE-194?
2014-07-23T12:46:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, all my changes are pushed up.. feel free to test out the styling too

2014-07-23T13:09:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: good question.. michelled do you have time to do the review on that?
2014-07-23T13:10:20 <michelled> I might Justin_o
2014-07-23T13:11:29 <Justin_o> michelled: would you be able to look at that pull, cindy and I both have work in it
2014-07-23T13:11:53 <michelled> ok
2014-07-23T13:12:00 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks
2014-07-23T13:24:05 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2014-07-23T13:24:28 <Bosmon> I\'ve written up our pirate pad here: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+on+valueMapper+Requirements
2014-07-23T13:24:45 <Bosmon> And raised http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5479 for this
2014-07-23T13:24:51 <Bosmon> I expect to have something in a couple of hours
2014-07-23T13:26:25 * yzen joined the channel
2014-07-23T13:27:18 <cindyli> that\'s fast, Bosmon
2014-07-23T13:27:31 <Bosmon> Well, I find most of the implementation was already "there"....
2014-07-23T13:27:44 <Bosmon> it\'s just it was mostly abandoned in a semi-working condition about 2 years ago
2014-07-23T13:28:41 <cindyli> whoa, that\'s nice. don\'t need to start from scratch
2014-07-23T13:30:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: for FLOE-204 I have to lint all of the files.. do mind if i do this before your FLOE-171 branch gets in?
2014-07-23T13:30:54 <cindyli> that\'s ok, go ahead
2014-07-23T13:33:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. by the way, what did you do for the fluid_1_5 thing.. did you remove fluid from the arguments?
2014-07-23T13:33:46 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, in FLOE-171 branch
2014-07-23T13:34:12 <cindyli> Justin_o: i didn\'t remove fluid but changed fluid_1_5 to fluid
2014-07-23T13:34:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. i\'ll probably do the same in mine.. i don\'t think that will cause a conflict if the change is the same
2014-07-23T13:34:18 <Justin_o> ah okay
2014-07-23T13:34:35 <Justin_o> if they are the same, i don\'t think it is needed
2014-07-23T13:34:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2014-07-23T13:35:24 <cindyli> Justin_o: well, agree, but it seems a convention to have fluid as a pass-in arg
2014-07-23T13:35:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think it\'s only for cases where we have the versioned fluid as the passed in arg.. maybe Bosmon or michelled could confirm that..
2014-07-23T13:37:08 <Bosmon> Projects which use Infusion shouldn\'t include themselves in its versioning scheme

2014-07-23T13:39:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you\'d expect our closure to look something like this then
2014-07-23T13:39:24 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bocLkHGy
2014-07-23T13:39:37 <cindyli> Bosmon: in this script - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/js/pouchDBDataSource.js#L18, both line 18 and line 94 have "fluid" as the 2nd argument. should we keep it there or remove the 2nd argument completely?
2014-07-23T13:41:10 <Bosmon> It\'s ok to have plain "fluid" there if you like
2014-07-23T13:41:15 <Bosmon> So long as it isn\'t a versioned fluid
2014-07-23T13:41:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i guess we\'ll do that then.. thanks
2014-07-23T13:42:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: so i\'ll keep it the way you have it in your pull
2014-07-23T13:42:16 <cindyli> ok. thanks

2014-07-23T13:46:24 <simonjb> Bosmon: thanks very much for taking a look at my pull request -- for the acceptance test failures that you are seeing, is it always the one I captured in this comment? http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-94?focusedCommentId=12453&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12453
2014-07-23T13:47:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - that one or one of the similar ones
2014-07-23T13:47:23 <Bosmon> I think I\'ve seen at least 3 different patterns of failure
2014-07-23T13:47:29 <Bosmon> But I think they all stem from the same cause
2014-07-23T13:47:34 <simonjb> Bosmon: interesting
2014-07-23T13:48:03 <simonjb> Bosmon: I will spend this morning investigating and let\'s discuss at the arch meeting
2014-07-23T13:48:45 <Bosmon> simonjb - I\'ll try and do a few more runs before the meeting - but I don\'t expect the pattern to be much different
2014-07-23T13:49:17 <Bosmon> Perhaps if we each do 10 runs on both the old and the new code on our respective systems, that will slightly increase our quantification of the problem : P
2014-07-23T13:50:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: how are the testRegistrySettingsHandler.js and testSpiSettingsHandler.js tests running for you?
2014-07-23T13:50:35 <Bosmon> simonjb - they run as well as they used to
2014-07-23T13:50:47 <Bosmon> That is, they pass, and leave the mouse trails setting uncancelled : P
2014-07-23T13:50:59 <simonjb> ok
2014-07-23T13:51:16 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-07-23T13:51:30 <simonjb> I sometimes get a failure in testSpiSettingsHandler.js
2014-07-23T13:52:19 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T13:52:31 <Bosmon> It\'s not a great surprise
2014-07-23T13:52:37 <simonjb> Bosmon: indeed
2014-07-23T13:52:41 <Bosmon> Since as we mentioned, there is exactly zero protection against races in any of this code
2014-07-23T13:52:50 <Bosmon> We should be surprised that it ever appeared to work
2014-07-23T13:53:00 <simonjb> sad face
2014-07-23T13:53:13 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry
2014-07-23T13:53:24 <Bosmon> It\'s a sad pausing point after all your hard work on this branch : P
2014-07-23T13:53:28 <Bosmon> But we\'ll get there in the end......
2014-07-23T13:53:30 <simonjb> it is what it is
2014-07-23T13:53:46 <Bosmon> I think the absolute bare minimum we need is some infrastructure for asynchronous settings handlers
2014-07-23T13:54:00 <Bosmon> Which seems to imply that we will need some core architectural work before we can go on
2014-07-23T13:54:01 <simonjb> ultimately I want to get to us having reliable automated tests
2014-07-23T13:54:31 <Bosmon> And so the "absolute bargain basement" is for the handlers to simply pause for some annoyingly large number of seconds when applying SPI settings
2014-07-23T13:55:16 <Bosmon> But a proper solution it seems would have this "little app" which relays Windows desktop events back to the architecture over REST
2014-07-23T13:55:24 <simonjb> yes, that\'s a option -- before we go that route, it would be good to understand the other options
2014-07-23T13:55:59 <Bosmon> But either of those solutions would still require the work for the core architecture to deal in asynchronous settings handlers at all - which was on the table a while back but we seemed to convince ourselves we could make the requirement go away for a while
2014-07-23T13:56:04 <simonjb> but isn\'t it also the case that we think there are events that we never got notified of?
2014-07-23T13:56:11 <Bosmon> Since we had test cases which "apparently worked a lot of the time" : P
2014-07-23T13:57:04 <simonjb> or which we cann\'t detect -- might be a better way of phrasing it
2014-07-23T13:57:22 <simonjb> such as when high contrast is applied?
2014-07-23T13:57:36 <Bosmon> simonjb - there may be holes in the event support in Windows, but I believe there should be enough to make the system "substantially good"
2014-07-23T13:57:44 <Bosmon> But I guess we\'ll only know through experimentation
2014-07-23T13:57:50 <simonjb> ok, that sounds promising
2014-07-23T13:57:58 <Bosmon> For example I read that Windows 8 no longer supplies the standard event when the desktop wallpaper is changed
2014-07-23T13:58:24 <Bosmon> At least there ARE some standard events we could begin by listening to
2014-07-23T13:58:32 <Bosmon> And after that we could start snooping on nonstandard ones
2014-07-23T13:58:47 <Bosmon> Then after that we can fall back on a fixed timeout as a "final guard"
2014-07-23T13:58:55 <Bosmon> After that I have an idea for a ridiculous scheme
2014-07-23T13:59:17 <simonjb> Bosmon: let\'s try and talk about this at the arch meeting

2014-07-23T10:09:18 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I think you have something screwed up in your filespace
2014-07-23T10:09:29 <Bosmon> That copy of Infusion looks seriously out of date and in the wrong place
2014-07-23T10:09:56 <jhernandez> mmmmm
2014-07-23T10:10:13 <jhernandez> as I said before,
2014-07-23T10:10:18 <jhernandez> 11:41 < jhernandez> pulled amb26/GPII-873
2014-07-23T10:10:18 <jhernandez> 11:41 < jhernandez> npm installed
2014-07-23T10:10:18 <jhernandez> 11:41 < jhernandez> and ....
2014-07-23T10:10:18 <jhernandez> 11:42 < jhernandez> not working
2014-07-23T10:10:21 <Bosmon> Is that actually the one you meant to check out
2014-07-23T10:10:38 <Bosmon> In "drafts/grunt-gpii" ?
2014-07-23T10:11:26 <jhernandez> yeah, I use temp folders in "drafts" to test things
2014-07-23T10:12:53 <Bosmon> ok, I will check out again and see if I can guess what can have gone wrong...
2014-07-23T10:13:02 <jhernandez> just pulled your universal/GPII-873, removed the node_modules folde and npm installed it - is that disturbing your karma? :P
2014-07-23T10:14:05 <Bosmon> jhernandez - that isn\'t a valid install procedure : P
2014-07-23T10:14:20 <jhernandez> xDDDDDD
2014-07-23T10:14:26 <jhernandez> IT IS?
2014-07-23T10:14:28 <Bosmon> I will be HARSHING ON YOUR VIBE!
2014-07-23T10:14:30 <jhernandez> *IT IS!!!
2014-07-23T10:14:46 <Bosmon> Well ok, I\'ll try doing that myself and see what happens
2014-07-23T10:14:52 <Bosmon> But you\'re really meant to use Steve\'s grunt scripts now
2014-07-23T10:14:59 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-07-23T10:14:59 <Bosmon> And start from one of the arch-specific roots
2014-07-23T10:15:09 <jhernandez> will try it again from scratch
2014-07-23T10:15:15 <Bosmon> What did you do to remove duplicate copies of Infusion?
2014-07-23T10:15:24 <Bosmon> Probably nothing, I expect!!
2014-07-23T10:15:51 <jhernandez> but the point is that our linux repo doesn\'t have to make anything with it, universal\'s tests are failing themselves
2014-07-23T10:15:56 <Bosmon> I\'ll issue a pull to improve Steve\'s scripts soon
2014-07-23T10:16:02 <Bosmon> jhernandez - they are failing because you installed it incorrectly!
2014-07-23T10:16:19 <jhernandez> and yes, I manually removed duped infusion
2014-07-23T10:16:21 <Bosmon> I\'ll improve Steve\'s scripts so universal has a self-contained install task
2014-07-23T10:16:31 <Bosmon> manually!
2014-07-23T10:16:49 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:16:53 <Bosmon> I will try doing what you did
2014-07-23T10:16:56 <Bosmon> And see if I can reproduce it
2014-07-23T10:16:57 <jhernandez> http://imagenes.es.sftcdn.net/es/scrn/59000/59487/family-guy-evil-monkey-4.jpg
2014-07-23T10:17:05 <jhernandez> xD
2014-07-23T10:17:26 <Bosmon> I will COMMIT EXACTLY THE SAME CRIMES, IN EXACTLY THE SAME ORDER!!
2014-07-23T10:17:33 <jhernandez> hahahaha
2014-07-23T10:18:46 <Bosmon> I\'m puzzled why we even get a node_modules directory when cloning universal...........
2014-07-23T10:19:02 <jhernandez> I\'ll start again from scratch, and by following the "SACRED" procedure :P :P
2014-07-23T10:20:11 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-07-23T10:20:13 <jhernandez> that\'s true
2014-07-23T10:20:33 <Bosmon> There shouldn\'t be one
2014-07-23T10:20:38 <Bosmon> If you are actually on the correct branch
2014-07-23T10:21:22 <jhernandez> BUT, you get node_modules folder when pulling your branch
2014-07-23T10:21:24 <Bosmon> I think you\'ve just checked out my master or something ancient like that
2014-07-23T10:21:25 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-07-23T10:21:31 <Bosmon> But it will go away, when you switch to the right branch
2014-07-23T10:21:39 <jhernandez> DAMMMNYOUU ANTVANIGGG!
2014-07-23T10:22:20 <jhernandez> yes
2014-07-23T10:22:23 <jhernandez> that\'s true
2014-07-23T10:22:43 <jhernandez> update your master branch from time to timee ... :p
2014-07-23T10:22:52 <Bosmon> why!
2014-07-23T10:22:55 <Bosmon> I never use it for anything
2014-07-23T10:23:05 <Bosmon> Only a disgraceful person makes pull requests from their master branch.....
2014-07-23T10:24:12 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:24:26 <Bosmon> So, interestingly, this fails for me too - only with a different message
2014-07-23T10:24:32 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-23T10:24:36 <Bosmon> "Error invoking global function - gpii.solutionsRegistry could not be located"
2014-07-23T10:24:57 <jhernandez> Bosmon: remove your dupped copies of infusion!
2014-07-23T10:25:00 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-23T10:25:11 <Bosmon> I did....
2014-07-23T10:25:14 <jhernandez> oops
2014-07-23T10:25:25 <Bosmon> Using exactly the same "manual method" as you : P
2014-07-23T10:26:05 <jhernandez> (I\'m sure that my manual method is better) :P
2014-07-23T10:26:12 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:26:15 <Bosmon> so something odd has happened
2014-07-23T10:26:25 <Bosmon> My npm install has not actually installed all dependencies
2014-07-23T10:26:45 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-07-23T10:26:49 <jhernandez> interesting ...
2014-07-23T10:27:26 <Bosmon> So
2014-07-23T10:27:30 <Bosmon> The one I have seems to be 1.3.6
2014-07-23T10:27:42 <Bosmon> Which I think is the version which doesn\'t install all the duplicates
2014-07-23T10:27:46 <Bosmon> Although it did install SOME duplicates
2014-07-23T10:28:07 <jhernandez> 1.4.20 here
2014-07-23T10:29:20 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:29:31 <Bosmon> So amazingly I seem to have an index.js which doesn\'t actually load the solutions registry..........
2014-07-23T10:29:34 <Bosmon> What on earth is going on....
2014-07-23T10:29:59 <Bosmon> ok, it seems the real one doesn\'t either...
2014-07-23T10:31:02 <Bosmon> Ah, it is loaded in these "configs"...
2014-07-23T10:31:08 <jhernandez> Bosmon: stop breaking things!
2014-07-23T10:35:29 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:35:30 <Bosmon> It works fine
2014-07-23T10:35:49 <Bosmon> I found the issue, at least I found MY issue - you must, as I say, follow the official install procedure : P
2014-07-23T10:36:14 <Bosmon> It must be the case that, for example, "universal" is held within a directory named node_modules - otherwise it will be unable to resolve itself
2014-07-23T10:36:23 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-23T10:36:30 <jhernandez> i have mine like that
2014-07-23T10:36:43 <jhernandez> /home/jhernandez/drafts/GPII-873/node_modules/universal
2014-07-23T10:36:51 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:37:01 <Bosmon> Well, other than that, it works
2014-07-23T10:37:30 <Bosmon> 62/62 tests pass!
2014-07-23T10:38:58 <Bosmon> The pastie you gave is impossible if you have the branch up to date
2014-07-23T10:39:07 <Bosmon> Since there is no code on line 1646 of FluidIoC.js that could cause the error you saw
2014-07-23T10:39:16 <Bosmon> So perhaps you checked out the branch incorrectly?
2014-07-23T10:39:18 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-07-23T10:39:20 <Bosmon> Tell me what git commands you did
2014-07-23T10:39:40 <jhernandez> git clone git://github.com/amb26/universal.git
2014-07-23T10:39:45 <Bosmon> There should also be no node_modules directory to delete if you are on the correct branch
2014-07-23T10:39:54 <jhernandez> git checkout GPII-873
2014-07-23T10:40:01 <Bosmon> !
2014-07-23T10:40:02 <Bosmon> TERRIBLE
2014-07-23T10:40:05 <Bosmon> YOU SHOULD BE KILLED
2014-07-23T10:40:15 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-07-23T10:40:19 <jhernandez> waaaat?!
2014-07-23T10:40:32 <Bosmon> Don\'t you know how to check out branches on git!!!!!
2014-07-23T10:41:20 <Bosmon> https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html
2014-07-23T10:42:09 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-07-23T10:42:12 <Bosmon> To be honest I can\'t understand this "but there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote" nonsense
2014-07-23T10:42:22 <Bosmon> But I never use such a command since it so often does the wrong thing
2014-07-23T10:42:38 <Bosmon> You should write git checkout -b GPII-873 origin/GPII-873
2014-07-23T10:42:40 <jhernandez> unless I have several remotes
2014-07-23T10:42:45 <Bosmon> To be completely clear what branch you will get
2014-07-23T10:42:49 <jhernandez> I always use this way
2014-07-23T10:43:01 <Bosmon> After you do this you should see no node_modules directory and an up to date FluidIoC.js
2014-07-23T10:43:03 <jhernandez> when having several remotes, I use -b
2014-07-23T10:43:21 <jhernandez> so I don\'t see any difference
2014-07-23T10:43:36 <jhernandez> my last commit is GPII-873: Improvements to Linux solutions - use quantize and linearScale transforms for better future invertibility
2014-07-23T10:44:01 <Bosmon> Ok, so open up your FluidIoC.js and tell me what you see on line 1646
2014-07-23T10:44:07 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-23T10:44:49 <jhernandez> togo = func.apply(null, invokeSpec.args);
2014-07-23T10:44:53 <Bosmon> ok
2014-07-23T10:45:05 <Bosmon> ok
