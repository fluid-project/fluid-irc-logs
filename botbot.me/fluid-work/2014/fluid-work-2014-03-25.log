b'2014-03-25T17:50:04 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-25T17:52:27 <clown> there is one small worry, but I have no data to back it up:  It\'s if the name "alsa-lib" refers to something completely different on one distro, vs. another.
2014-03-25T17:52:57 <clown> For example, on Fedora "alsa-lib" means one thing, but one Debian it means something very different.
2014-03-25T17:53:08 <clown> *but ON Debian...
2014-03-25T17:53:09 <jhernandez> yeah, I know what you\'re talking about
2014-03-25T17:53:17 <clown> The match would be wrong in that case.
2014-03-25T17:53:24 <clown> But, I don\'t know if that\'s possible.
2014-03-25T17:54:17 <jhernandez> at this point we should take care about saying in the solution registry that x solution is provided by the y package
2014-03-25T17:54:43 * clown notes that the package id includes the distro.
2014-03-25T17:54:52 <clown> sure.
2014-03-25T17:55:18 <jhernandez> I mean, this is something that a developer is supposed to has into account when filling this field in a solution registry entry
2014-03-25T17:56:51 <jhernandez> we, at a first glance have used alsa-lib, but in the future we need to be sure that the alsa system is provided by that package or by any other one
2014-03-25T17:58:50 <clown> are you saying that the name can change over time?
2014-03-25T17:59:00 <clown> that\'s what I\'m understanding you to say.
2014-03-25T18:00:59 <jhernandez> yes, they can change
2014-03-25T18:01:21 <jhernandez> distributors, ie, take alsa and make \'n\' packages from it
2014-03-25T18:02:01 <jhernandez> openSUSE maybe split it into 2 or 3, while fedora in 4 or 5
2014-03-25T18:02:09 <jhernandez> and call them different
2014-03-25T18:04:46 <clown> sounds like a mess...
2014-03-25T18:05:26 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-25T18:05:58 <jhernandez> but anyway, it doesn\'t matter, we use these names in the same way we can use a setting from orca
2014-03-25T18:06:56 <jhernandez> if joanie changes the name of a particular setting in orca, we have to update our entry of orca in the solutions registry
2014-03-25T18:07:17 <clown> yup.  And maybe support older systems at the same time (yuck).
2014-03-25T18:07:33 * clown shakes fist at joanie.
2014-03-25T18:07:43 * clown lucky for me, she\'s not here.
2014-03-25T18:07:51 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-25T18:08:58 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-03-25T18:10:40 <jhernandez> and yeah, about supporting older systems at the same time
2014-03-25T18:11:53 <jhernandez> I would see that as another entry, and the GPII using them according to the available version of orca
2014-03-25T18:13:00 <clown> another entry where?
2014-03-25T18:13:09 * michelled has quit
2014-03-25T18:13:11 <jhernandez> in the solutions registry, maybe
2014-03-25T18:13:26 <jhernandez> (in the future)
2014-03-25T18:13:56 <jhernandez> when I was a child, in the future I was expected to see flying cars and I\'m not
2014-03-25T18:14:01 <jhernandez> xDDD

2014-03-25T18:17:19 <jhernandez> I was about leaving too
2014-03-25T18:17:40 <jhernandez> tty later/tomorrow/in the future :P
2014-03-25T18:17:56 <clown> yes, tomorrow you will go to work in flying car.
2014-03-25T18:18:51 <jhernandez> heh, then I have to find an office to go to work
2014-03-25T18:18:51 <jhernandez> :P

'

b'2014-03-25T16:21:00 <clown> yes.  still trying to diagnose.
2014-03-25T16:21:12 <clown> no, I forgot to do that.  (I always do).
2014-03-25T16:21:25 <jhernandez> maybe duped infusion?
2014-03-25T16:22:02 <clown> maybe I should clean things out first.
2014-03-25T16:22:23 <jhernandez> kasparnet: would like to move the device reporter thing
2014-03-25T16:22:49 <jhernandez> could http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-413 be the right place to talk about it?
2014-03-25T16:24:49 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-03-25T16:34:58 * colinclark has quit
2014-03-25T16:35:23 <kasparnet> clown, jhernandez: universal+kettle references to infusion was just updated last night, so npm install would be necessary
2014-03-25T16:35:39 <clown> thanks kasparent
2014-03-25T16:35:54 <clown> did you update before branching, jhernandez?
2014-03-25T16:36:22 * anastasiac has quit
2014-03-25T16:36:43 <kasparnet> jhernandez: yeah - either that JIRA or on the list - whichever you prefer
2014-03-25T16:37:09 <kasparnet> if you start the conversation in JIRA, make sure to ping antranig, basman and I in it, so we\'ll get pings on new messages
2014-03-25T16:37:38 <kasparnet> clown, jhernandez: it\'s _really_ exciting that the device reporter work is getting close to functional
2014-03-25T16:37:48 <jhernandez> clown: not sure
2014-03-25T16:38:03 <kasparnet> it\'s gonna be such an improvement to the system not to have the damn mock there
2014-03-25T16:38:03 <clown> jhernandez:  when I switch to your device reporter branch in universal, there is not package.json.
2014-03-25T16:38:25 <kasparnet> JAVI! Stop deleting random files in universal!
2014-03-25T16:38:37 <clown> *this is no package.json in the "unversal" folder, jhernandez
2014-03-25T16:38:58 <clown> are you sure they are merely random, kasparnet?
2014-03-25T16:39:01 <jhernandez> kasparnet: thanks, added a comment to GPII-413
2014-03-25T16:39:36 <jhernandez> kasparnet: wtf? was it me?
2014-03-25T16:39:49 <jhernandez> (anyway, I like breaking things :P)
2014-03-25T16:40:24 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-03-25T16:40:29 <jhernandez> clown: it\'s there https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/blob/device-reporter-draft/package.json
2014-03-25T16:40:45 <kasparnet> haha - I have no idea - just felt it\'d be fun to do some random yelling at you
2014-03-25T16:40:50 <kasparnet> didn\'t check the repo or anything
2014-03-25T16:41:02 <jhernandez> just joking about it :P
2014-03-25T16:41:31 <karan10> hi, for project picture dictionary, approach would be to use an existing RESTful API or building a new one to get pictures ?
2014-03-25T16:43:38 <clown> jhernandez:  but not after I did a \'git pull \xe2\x80\x94rebase\' on the "device-reporter-draft".  Weird.
2014-03-25T16:43:49 * clown looking for explanation.
2014-03-25T16:44:18 <jhernandez> clown: weird, yes
2014-03-25T16:46:02 * jhernandez is pretty sure that clown is typing on his keyboard randomly -> http://media.tumblr.com/83ff10216be11cb3c8fcd2fd3d230d45/tumblr_inline_mnzt2ckrie1qz4rgp.gif
2014-03-25T16:46:05 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2014-03-25T16:46:07 <clown> I have a file window open on that directory, and when I do a \'get checkout javihernandez/device-reporter-draft", I can see the package.json file disappear.  Very weird.
2014-03-25T16:46:34 <clown> hey!  my tongues isn\'t hanging out of my mouth!
2014-03-25T16:46:38 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2014-03-25T16:46:39 <clown> all two of them.
2014-03-25T16:48:31 <jhernandez> clown: I\'m still puzzled about your problem
2014-03-25T16:48:57 <clown> as am I.  I decided to start eating lunch to see if it goes away.  :-)
2014-03-25T16:49:17 <jhernandez> maybe added a remote in the wrong folder (aka: git repo)?
2014-03-25T16:49:23 <jhernandez> hahaha
2014-03-25T16:49:43 <clown> maybe .  I added the remote while in universal...
2014-03-25T16:50:22 <jhernandez> show me your "git remote -v"
2014-03-25T16:50:24 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-25T16:50:43 <jhernandez> anyway
2014-03-25T16:50:43 <karan10> justin_o: hi, for project picture dictionary, approach would be to use an existing RESTful API or building a new one to get pictures ?
2014-03-25T16:50:51 <jhernandez> clown: go for lunch
2014-03-25T16:51:14 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'m aleady eating it.
2014-03-25T16:52:43 <clown> any problem with simply \'git branch -d\' to get rid of my copy of the device-reporter-draft branch, and then starting again with "git fetch -a -v javihernandez"?
2014-03-25T16:53:00 <jhernandez> np
2014-03-25T16:53:04 <jhernandez> but use -D
2014-03-25T16:53:06 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-03-25T16:53:54 <clown> btw, git remote -v reports:

2014-03-25T16:54:23 <jhernandez> who will win?
2014-03-25T16:54:25 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-03-25T16:54:54 <clown> no contest.  GPII will absorb all of your work.
2014-03-25T16:54:58 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-25T16:55:18 <jhernandez> remove javihernandez/linux.git and use javihernandez/universal.git instead

2014-03-25T17:11:38 <jhernandez> not in the browser but in the command line from you\'ve started the gpii
2014-03-25T17:12:11 <clown> yes, I noticed something there about orca.

2014-03-25T17:19:00 <jhernandez> clown: ^
2014-03-25T17:19:17 <clown> jhernandez:  took me a while because there is lots of output messages.
2014-03-25T17:19:19 <clown> But...
2014-03-25T17:19:39 <clown> All I found was the one for orca.  No alsa-project.
2014-03-25T17:20:10 <clown> For example:
2014-03-25T17:20:10 <clown> 13:10:55.486:   Firing event onSuccess of component with typename kettle.requests.request.http and id aixnejs3-162 to list of 1 listeners
2014-03-25T17:20:10 <clown> [ { id: \'org.gnome.orca\' } ]
2014-03-25T17:20:10 <clown> 13:11:35.000:   Firing event onNewRequest of component with typename kettle.requests and id aixnejs3-32 to list of 1 listeners
2014-03-25T17:20:40 <jhernandez> mm
2014-03-25T17:21:25 <jhernandez> perhaps alsa\'s package is called different in fedora
2014-03-25T17:22:48 * clown checking to see what is installed on my system \xe2\x80\x94 pkcon to the rescue!
2014-03-25T17:22:53 <jhernandez> (I\'m under openSUSE)
2014-03-25T17:23:07 <jhernandez> yeah, search for alsa
2014-03-25T17:23:20 <jhernandez> or just run a rpm -qa|grep -i alsa
2014-03-25T17:23:58 <clown> I have alsa-firmware, alsa-lib, alsa-lib-devel, alsa-plugins-pulseaudio, alsa-tools-firmware, and alsa-utils.  Those are installed.
2014-03-25T17:24:17 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s the problem
2014-03-25T17:26:10 <jhernandez> in openSUSE the package is called "alsa", but if you change the package name to match "alsa-lib" into the solution registry file it should work there
2014-03-25T17:26:28 <jhernandez> anyway, that\'s a good use case
2014-03-25T17:26:42 <jhernandez> same software have different names in different distributions
2014-03-25T17:26:50 <clown> BTW, there is a GUI app available, that I don\'t have installed, called:  alsamixergui-0.9.0-0.16.rc2.fc20.x86_64
2014-03-25T17:27:47 <clown> But, I\'ll try changing the name \xe2\x80\x94 do I need to re-build anything?
2014-03-25T17:27:53 <jhernandez> nope
2014-03-25T17:27:57 <jhernandez> just start it again
2014-03-25T17:28:02 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-25T17:36:02 <clown> Finally found  it!  (Too many things are called "solutions"...)
2014-03-25T17:36:37 <clown> Now I get  "[ { id: \'org.gnome.orca\' }, { id: \'org.alsa-project\' } ]", jhernandez
2014-03-25T17:37:14 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-25T17:37:57 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s the experiment
2014-03-25T17:38:17 <clown> Cool.  Nice.
2014-03-25T17:39:21 <clown> btw, does the different name for alsa imply that the Fedora and OpenSUSE are different OSes as far as GPII is concerned?  (mostly rhetorical).
2014-03-25T17:40:00 * clown is grateful there is only one orca
2014-03-25T17:40:30 <jhernandez> maybe not diffent OSes in terms of the GPII, but yes for our packageKit\'s device reporter plugin
2014-03-25T17:41:27 <jhernandez> ie, we can put in the alsa\'s solution entry:
2014-03-25T17:41:37 <clown> wild speculation:  the structure gpii.packageKit {} should have a distro property?
2014-03-25T17:42:08 <jhernandez> maybe, or just
2014-03-25T17:42:09 <jhernandez> "gpii.packageKit": {
2014-03-25T17:42:09 <jhernandez> "name": "alsa",
2014-03-25T17:42:09 <jhernandez> "version": ">=1"
2014-03-25T17:42:15 <jhernandez> }
2014-03-25T17:42:33 <clown> that\'s what\'s there now.
2014-03-25T17:42:59 <clown> except, I changed the name to "alsa-lib" (for Fedora).
2014-03-25T17:43:06 <jhernandez> could turn into "gpii.packageKit": [{ "name": "alsa", "version": ">=1" } {"name": "alsa-lib", "version": ">=1" }]
2014-03-25T17:43:17 <jhernandez> we can iterate over the possible matches
2014-03-25T17:43:32 <clown> and not care about the distro?  yes, maybe.
2014-03-25T17:43:37 <jhernandez> and if there\'s a match, we\'re done with this solution
2014-03-25T17:43:48 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s my opinion
2014-03-25T17:44:30 <clown> small but:  when I look at that, the question "who calls it "alsa-lib" pops into my head.  Maybe I should ignore that voice.
2014-03-25T17:44:34 <jhernandez> oops, sorry [{ "name": "alsa", "version": ">=1" }, {"name": "alsa-lib", "version": ">=1" }]
2014-03-25T17:44:39 <jhernandez> (missed the comma)
2014-03-25T17:45:40 <jhernandez> well, fedora calls it alsa-lib
2014-03-25T17:46:24 <clown> Maybe comments are sufficient [{ "name": "alsa", "version": ">=1" /*OpenSUSE, Debian*/}, {"name": "alsa-lib", "version": ">=1" /*Fedora*/ }]
2014-03-25T17:46:29 <jhernandez> our packageKit device reporer plugin reports that name back
2014-03-25T17:46:54 <clown> indeed
2014-03-25T17:47:08 <jhernandez> yeah, but comments aren\'t allowed into JSON-formatted objects
2014-03-25T17:47:20 <jhernandez> but we can live without them :P
2014-03-25T17:47:44 <clown> sure.
2014-03-25T17:50:02 * jhernandez writes down these thoughts on his (physical) notepad

2014-03-25T15:05:45 <cindyli> thanks, kasparnet, i\'m working on a case of model relay that uses conditional transform, where the inverted transform is needed. Can I attach a customized inverted transform function to the conditional tranform?
2014-03-25T15:08:38 * clown joined the channel
2014-03-25T15:14:39 <sgithens> colinclark kasparnet : Tomorrow is the security tasks meeting and then next week is the api doc meeting right?
2014-03-25T15:14:48 <colinclark> yup
2014-03-25T15:14:53 <sgithens> awesome
2014-03-25T15:18:04 <jhernandez> clown: morning
2014-03-25T15:18:48 <clown> hi jhernandez
2014-03-25T15:19:04 <jhernandez> i have a few updates on device reporting
2014-03-25T15:19:57 <jhernandez> 1st, I have been writing a bit of documentation
2014-03-25T15:19:58 <clown> cool.  I\'ve just got into office, and getting things launched, and email read, etc.
2014-03-25T15:21:01 <jhernandez> I think that it can be useful to you to understand a little bit more about how the device reporter works now
2014-03-25T15:21:02 <clown> where is the documentation, jhernandez?  On the gpii wiki?
2014-03-25T15:21:36 * clown thanks jhernandez.
2014-03-25T15:21:39 <jhernandez> it\'s on my google drive, wait a sec I can share it with you
2014-03-25T15:22:38 <jhernandez> clown: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqbrsVeQ0OP4j2rsjkF9ml5YC8y2YZROVdEio6E9xaU/edit?usp=sharing
2014-03-25T15:23:03 * clown looks
2014-03-25T15:24:17 <clown> jhernandez:  I just read "Also,  there\xe2\x80\x99s a little (but enough) dedicated page \xe2\x80\xa6"  Did you mean "not enough", perhaps?  :-)
2014-03-25T15:25:45 <jhernandez> absolutely
2014-03-25T15:25:47 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-03-25T15:26:00 <jhernandez> changed now
2014-03-25T15:26:35 <clown> wow.  that was a lame attempt at humour.  I guessed right!?
2014-03-25T15:26:59 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-25T15:27:33 <jhernandez> well, is enough to someone who is used to how the personalization process is
2014-03-25T15:28:33 <clown> you make a good point \xe2\x80\x94 personal computers/phones are already set up for the person who owns them.
2014-03-25T15:28:51 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-25T15:29:11 <jhernandez> I think that I covered the most relevant facts
2014-03-25T15:29:22 * amilchev has left the channel
2014-03-25T15:29:54 <jhernandez> but this is just a draft so it should be extended
2014-03-25T15:30:04 <clown> I\'m wondering if the access-level is more that just two \xe2\x80\x94 full-featured vs. "kiosk".  Are there other levels of access (something to ponder)?
2014-03-25T15:31:48 <clown> A question about "Keyboard" under "Device Capabilities" \xe2\x80\x94 is that onscreen keyboard?  Or, physical keyboard?  If the latter, difference between laptop vs. desktop vs. kiosk keyboard?  (Do kiosks even have a keyboard?)
2014-03-25T15:31:58 <jhernandez> yeah, I think that the access level is a bigger term, not just as easy to say, "I\'m root"
2014-03-25T15:32:50 <jhernandez> I put keyboard as an example, and can be referred to the physical device, current layout (desktop/laptop), language layout, etc
2014-03-25T15:33:02 <kasparnet> cindyli: yeah, I think that should be possible
2014-03-25T15:33:10 * kasparnet is digging up some references
2014-03-25T15:33:20 <jhernandez> ... and yes, I\'ve seen kiosks with keyboards
2014-03-25T15:33:48 <jhernandez> ie: in the Andalusian\'s public unemployment service
2014-03-25T15:33:54 <jhernandez> we did the distro for them
2014-03-25T15:33:54 <clown> touch vs. physical mouse?
2014-03-25T15:34:26 <jhernandez> yeah, don\'t know if mouse is something relevant, but yes, this is something that could be reported as well
2014-03-25T15:34:52 <kasparnet> cindyli: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/ModelTransformationTransforms.js#L112-L114
2014-03-25T15:35:30 <jhernandez> clown: those kiosks have this keyboard http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/203439629/metal_keyboard_with_Trackball_industrial_keyboard_kiosk.jpg
2014-03-25T15:35:58 * clown looks
2014-03-25T15:36:20 <clown> it even has mouse buttons, as keys!
2014-03-25T15:36:26 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-03-25T15:36:48 <clown> and you can see the camera person reflected in the track ball.
2014-03-25T15:36:53 <jhernandez> with "keyboards" I was thinking about that kind of keyboards
2014-03-25T15:36:58 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-25T15:37:33 <jhernandez> usually you can\'t - the track ball is too dirty
2014-03-25T15:37:35 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-03-25T15:38:03 <clown> haha
2014-03-25T15:38:06 <kasparnet> you define the inverses by "invertConfiguration" property and adding the fluid.lens gradename
2014-03-25T15:39:20 <cindyli> cool. will try that, kasparnet, thanks.
2014-03-25T15:39:23 <clown> So, I got to the last section, jhernandez, "Sketching a new implementation", and, ...
2014-03-25T15:39:31 * jhernandez nods
2014-03-25T15:39:41 <jhernandez> that part needs to be written
2014-03-25T15:40:19 <jhernandez> but I just wanted to put all the info we have collected about it
2014-03-25T15:40:33 <jhernandez> .... and this leads to my 2nd update
2014-03-25T15:41:02 <jhernandez> yesterday I did a first working approach
2014-03-25T15:41:31 <jhernandez> working, it reports installed solutions by using our packageKit thing :)
2014-03-25T15:42:36 <clown> jhernandez, that\'s great news.Time for me to do a git pull
2014-03-25T15:42:38 <clown> ?
2014-03-25T15:43:09 <jhernandez> ofc
2014-03-25T15:43:23 * jhernandez looks for the links
2014-03-25T15:44:01 <jhernandez> https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/tree/device-reporter-draft and https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/device-reporter-draft
2014-03-25T15:44:13 <clown> dumb newbit question:  does "ofc" mean "of course"?
2014-03-25T15:44:17 <clown> *newbie
2014-03-25T15:44:26 <jhernandez> clown: ofc
2014-03-25T15:44:27 <jhernandez> xD
2014-03-25T15:44:29 <jhernandez> yes!
2014-03-25T15:44:30 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-03-25T15:44:31 <clown> LOL
2014-03-25T15:44:42 <jhernandez> re those branches
2014-03-25T15:45:11 <jhernandez> as you can imagine, they\'re just a "draft"
2014-03-25T15:45:41 <clown> understood.  Okay git question:  which branch should I be on when I pull?
2014-03-25T15:46:22 <jhernandez> linux/device-reporter-draft has our packageKitBranch merged in
2014-03-25T15:46:37 <jhernandez> so you should change into master
2014-03-25T15:46:49 <jhernandez> git fetch -a -v javihernandez
2014-03-25T15:47:02 <jhernandez> git checkout javihernandez/device-reporter-draft
2014-03-25T15:47:30 <jhernandez> both in linux and universal
2014-03-25T15:47:51 <clown> in both linux and universal?  Okay, good to know.
2014-03-25T15:48:14 <jhernandez> at this moment it just prints the "installedSolutions" at the end
2014-03-25T15:48:26 <jhernandez> but it\'s a start
2014-03-25T15:49:30 <clown> yes.  it\'s a good start.
2014-03-25T15:50:01 <clown> Okay, after doing the checkout in linux (git checkout javihernandez/device-reporter-draft), I\'m in detached HEAD state.
2014-03-25T15:50:27 <clown> I\'m inclined to give it a name here.
2014-03-25T15:50:33 <jhernandez> I\'d do a git checkout -b javihernandez_device-reporter-draft
2014-03-25T15:50:42 <clown> right, that\'s what I meant.
2014-03-25T15:50:53 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-25T15:51:22 * jash4 joined the channel
2014-03-25T15:56:30 <clown> jhernandez, the \'git fetch -a -v javihernandez\' fails when I\'m in universal.
2014-03-25T15:56:46 <clown> I think I need to add a remote or two.
2014-03-25T15:56:55 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-25T16:00:55 <clown> okay jhernandez, git fetch and branching done.  Build?
2014-03-25T16:02:06 <clown> cleaned and built.  starting...
2014-03-25T16:02:39 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6 but didn\'t start.   Looking for errors...
