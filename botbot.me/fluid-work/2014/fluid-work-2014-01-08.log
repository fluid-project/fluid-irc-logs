b"2014-01-08T20:06:31 <Justin_o_> sorry, we mentioned it at standup, but forgot to tell you about it.

2014-01-08T20:13:34 <jhung> danaayotte: I'm going to go through the FLOE iteration plan page and split off the design tasks from the other tasks.
2014-01-08T20:13:46 <danaayotte> great, thanks
2014-01-08T20:14:01 <jhung> danaayotte: after that perhaps we can go through and chat about them so we know what we're going to do
2014-01-08T20:14:03 <jhung> ?
2014-01-08T20:15:13 <danaayotte> sounds good jhung.  i've been doing some thinking about the decoupled design but it would be good to check in
2014-01-08T20:15:56 <jhung> danaayotte:  great! I'll ping you in a few minutes
2014-01-08T20:23:14 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i've created a new branch in my repo GPII-226 https://github.com/jobara/prefsEditors/tree/GPII-226
2014-01-08T20:23:23 <Justin_o_> it basically just has chris' code merged in at this point
2014-01-08T20:23:35 <cindyli> nice, thanks, Justin_o_
2014-01-08T20:34:02 <jhung> danaayotte: sync up in 10 minutes on skype?

b'2014-01-08T00:56:09 <Bosmon8> Which is also just the kind of FS barrier that we need in order to curtail our recursive search for duplicate copies of Infusion
2014-01-08T00:57:21 <Bosmon8> I\'m also trying to remember the precise fate of yzen\'s "kettleModuleLoader" scheme that we eventually reasoned had to be abandoned
2014-01-08T00:57:57 <Bosmon8> With avtar\'s help, we eventually established that an app which expects to modify its own code loading filesystem cannot be tolerated
2014-01-08T00:58:57 <Bosmon8> Ah
2014-01-08T00:59:01 <Bosmon8> It actually still seems to be there
2014-01-08T00:59:20 <Bosmon8> Another thing for he and anastasiac to explain next week :)
2014-01-08T01:01:05 <Bosmon8> So another thing we will be free of when we write our own module loader is the bizarre requirement handed on to kettle users to sprinkle these kettleModuleLoader.js files everywhere
2014-01-08T01:07:44 * avtar has quit
2014-01-08T01:09:25 <colinclark> it is there
2014-01-08T01:09:38 <colinclark> and I believe it\'s not, at least, self modifying
2014-01-08T01:09:56 <colinclark> it\'s annoying, in that everyone who ever creates a kettle app has to stick one of these files in their configuration
2014-01-08T01:10:02 <colinclark> anyway, I think most of us are heading out for the night
2014-01-08T01:10:17 <colinclark> michelled and I have made a plan to chip and chisel away at the outstanding pull requests
2014-01-08T01:10:25 <colinclark> where i\'ll do some further reviews
2014-01-08T01:10:34 <colinclark> time for me to do something more than writing reports :P
2014-01-08T01:10:47 <colinclark> Bosmon8: I think the one thing that might be lingering is this Infusion bug you were working on

2014-01-08T17:04:35 <colinclark> Am I wrong to read it as a whitespace-related change to the org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard setting, rather than an addition?
2014-01-08T17:04:41 <colinclark> in Andrei
2014-01-08T17:05:34 <michelled> you\'re right colinclark - I didn\'t see line 29
2014-01-08T17:05:35 <michelled> thanks
2014-01-08T17:07:24 <Justin_o_> yzen: thanks
2014-01-08T17:07:32 <yzen> np
2014-01-08T17:07:35 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: do you have jiras for the work that we talked about on Skype today?

2014-01-08T17:11:06 <Justin_o_> yzen: do we have documentation about how to get all the gpii stuff up and running for dev work and testing
2014-01-08T17:13:45 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-226
2014-01-08T17:14:02 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: I think that should cover it
2014-01-08T17:14:20 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-08T17:16:33 <yzen> Justin_o_: it\'s more like kettle documentation
2014-01-08T17:16:37 <yzen> should be on fluid wiki
2014-01-08T17:16:50 <yzen> plus readies in the repo have some examples
2014-01-08T17:17:25 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: thanks
2014-01-08T17:18:17 <jhung> colinclark: a few weeks ago we had a conversation where you were describing why using EMs should be the standard practice for doing CSS media queries. Do you have a link handy I can use to pass on to someone else?
2014-01-08T17:18:38 <Justin_o_> yzen: okay.. are all of the servers run on a local machine or will be connecting to remote servers as well?
2014-01-08T17:19:02 <yzen> i think most of them you need to deploy
2014-01-08T17:19:08 <jhung> danaayotte: I\'m going to take a look at those jiras you filed yesterday. I\'ll let you know if there is anything.
2014-01-08T17:19:13 <yzen> the only one that we have running externally is the preferences server
2014-01-08T17:19:39 <Justin_o_> yzen: okay.. is there a list of all the servers that need to be deployed?
2014-01-08T17:19:51 <colinclark> This might have been it, jhung, but I\'m not entirely sure: http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/
2014-01-08T17:20:32 <yzen> Justin_o_: so these are all the apps that are deployed in a typical deployment https://github.com/yzen/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.development.json
2014-01-08T17:21:50 * avtar has quit
2014-01-08T17:21:54 <colinclark> Or it might have been this one, jhung: http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/7-habits-of-highly-effective-media-queries/ Or maybe even this one: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/11/19/techniques-for-responsive-typography/
2014-01-08T17:23:00 <jhung> colinclark: that\'s all great stuff, thanks! Those links will also go into our jira that addresses this issue for the Metadata editor.
2014-01-08T17:23:11 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2014-01-08T17:23:43 <Justin_o_> yzen: thanks.. i\'ll take a look at that
2014-01-08T17:26:56 <cindyli> yzen: do we need to deploy kettle first of all or that would be all?
2014-01-08T17:27:42 <yzen> cindyli: universal (architecture) is built using kettle, which is our server side framework
2014-01-08T17:30:41 <Justin_o_> yzen: so we only need to install and launch universal?
2014-01-08T17:31:18 <yzen> Justin_o_: yes, it will pull kettle as a dependency
2014-01-08T17:32:29 <Justin_o_> and there are no other repos we need to checkout.. other than universal and the prefsEditor one
2014-01-08T17:33:36 <Justin_o_> yzen: ^
2014-01-08T17:34:03 <yzen> yep if you are on mac nothing else

2014-01-08T17:36:05 <cindyli> yzen: i pulled universal and ran "npm install" and having "SSL Error: CERT_UNTRUSTED". do I need to update the configuration content that you gave to somewhere before running "npm install"?
2014-01-08T17:36:54 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i ran npm install but didn\'t see any errors
2014-01-08T17:37:02 <cindyli> oh no
2014-01-08T17:38:34 <yzen> try again cindyli remove node_modules
2014-01-08T17:38:39 <yzen> check your version of npm and node
2014-01-08T17:38:43 <yzen> i suggest get the latest one
2014-01-08T17:38:44 <cindyli> ok, thanks
2014-01-08T17:42:27 <cindyli> yzen: upgrading node and npm fixes the issue. what\'s the next step? update config file somewhere?
2014-01-08T17:42:52 <yzen> cindyli: well what exactly are you trying to do right now ?
2014-01-08T17:43:00 <cindyli> set up gpii server locally
2014-01-08T17:43:53 <yzen> cindyli: right
2014-01-08T17:43:57 <yzen> so once you did that you are deon
2014-01-08T17:44:00 <yzen> to deploy just run
2014-01-08T17:44:43 <yzen> NODE_ENV=fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.development node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js gpii/configs
2014-01-08T17:45:11 <yzen> what it does is it starts the system based on the config located at: gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.development.json
2014-01-08T17:45:15 <yzen> Justin_o_: cindyli ^
2014-01-08T17:45:36 <cindyli> cool trying
2014-01-08T17:45:40 <Justin_o_> yzen: thanks.. do we need to know what those initials mean?
2014-01-08T17:46:20 <yzen> just an acronym of what components are deployed: flow manager, preferences server, solutions registry etc
2014-01-08T17:46:35 <yzen> but name is irrelevant
2014-01-08T17:47:04 <Justin_o_> yzen: okay.. thanks
2014-01-08T17:47:12 <yzen> np :)
2014-01-08T17:47:15 <cindyli> yzen: got this error at the launch: ASSERTION FAILED:  Cannot autoInit component gpii.deviceReporter which does not have an initFunction and gradeNames defined
2014-01-08T17:47:29 <yzen> one sec
2014-01-08T17:47:29 <Justin_o_> yzen: looks like something\'s running.. anyway to test it out?
2014-01-08T17:49:06 <yzen> Justin_o_: sure curl to it by issues a request curl localhost:8081/user/nisha/login
2014-01-08T17:49:13 <yzen> you should get a successful message

2014-01-08T19:54:29 <jhung> Justin_o_, cindyli, danaayotte: Should we continue tasking? Justin_o_ if you think it\'s a good idea, that we tape out multiple iterations, not just the next one (sort of how we did it in Decapod where we knew roughly what each iteration was going to accomplish).
2014-01-08T19:56:57 * michelled joined the channel
2014-01-08T20:06:17 <Justin_o_> jhung: it might be a good idea to do multiple iterations since we have more than enough work. However, cindyli and I have been pulled off metadata for the moment.. probably for the rest of the week.. we need to help out with some gpii work that needs to be done for friday.

b'2014-01-08T00:00:58 <avtar> colinclark, michelled: find /path/to/src -name infusion -type d
2014-01-08T00:03:00 <Bosmon8> Of course what has happened might be even more bizarre, and you actually have zero versions of Infusion in the checkout
2014-01-08T00:03:34 <colinclark> There is definitely one
2014-01-08T00:03:38 <Bosmon8> I remember in the very early days of working with node having issues with resolution "spilling" out into further parent directories until it eventually finds an appropriate node_modules
2014-01-08T00:03:48 <Bosmon8> Ok.... what does its FluidIoC.js look like
2014-01-08T00:03:54 <colinclark> We\'re blasting universal and re-running the build script first
2014-01-08T00:04:00 <Bosmon8> ok
2014-01-08T00:04:08 <colinclark> and then avtar\'s going to run his find script
2014-01-08T00:04:11 <Bosmon8> :)
2014-01-08T00:04:13 <colinclark> whcih is probably far more accurate than my eyes
2014-01-08T00:04:51 <Bosmon8> Or as we troglodytes say, dir FluidIoC.js /s :)
2014-01-08T00:05:39 <Bosmon8> Actually you really are on Windows, aren\'t you
2014-01-08T00:05:44 <Bosmon8> So the suggestion isn\'t completely troglodytic
2014-01-08T00:05:52 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-08T00:09:31 <colinclark> no, it\'s not
2014-01-08T00:09:43 <colinclark> michelled and I spent a few minutes REASONING about the issue
2014-01-08T00:09:56 <colinclark> while she waited for the monstrous universal repository to clone itself
2014-01-08T00:10:12 <colinclark> and our best bet is that it\'s a mismatched version of Infusion

2014-01-08T00:14:14 <colinclark> these are amazing cats
2014-01-08T00:14:32 <colinclark> avtar was just telling me a story about how painful the massive size of Universal has been for him
2014-01-08T00:14:39 <colinclark> when running deployment tests as part of the costing project
2014-01-08T00:14:41 <Bosmon8> Right
2014-01-08T00:15:04 <colinclark> and how he ended up making yum packages instead of using git as a result
2014-01-08T00:15:05 <Bosmon8> Another reason we should make sure that Tony\'s mega-commit gets cherry-picked before it finally goes in : P
2014-01-08T00:15:10 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-08T00:15:11 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-08T00:15:38 <colinclark> wow, look at these tucked-in cats
2014-01-08T00:15:43 <colinclark> about halfway down
2014-01-08T00:15:45 <Bosmon8> Yes
2014-01-08T00:15:49 <colinclark> that might be the best thing ever
2014-01-08T00:15:50 <Bosmon8> Some of them seem on the other side of plausible
2014-01-08T00:16:02 <Bosmon8> Especially the one which appears to have fallen asleep in what looks like a drying rack
2014-01-08T00:16:19 <colinclark> the one folded into a box is pretty amazing, too
2014-01-08T00:16:26 <colinclark> he\'s basically unrecognizable as a cat
2014-01-08T00:16:32 <Bosmon8> hahahaha
2014-01-08T00:16:51 <colinclark> cats are so gifted at sleeping
2014-01-08T00:17:01 <Bosmon8> I feel that the one in a boot must have been put there
2014-01-08T00:17:11 <Bosmon8> Since I can\'t see how a CATT could get into a boot end-on without tipping it over
2014-01-08T00:17:44 <Bosmon8> Still cloning universal?
2014-01-08T00:17:56 <Bosmon8> Couldn\'t avtar just clone it from another instance of itself on the filesystem?
2014-01-08T00:18:13 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-08T00:18:39 <avtar> Bosmon8: the repo was getting cloned on new VMs
2014-01-08T00:18:51 <avtar> each time a new VM was provisioned
2014-01-08T00:19:52 <colinclark> As far as I know, michelled exclaimed a few minutes ago "I have a working system!"
2014-01-08T00:19:54 <Bosmon8> avtar - yes - couldn\'t you have set up a recent clone locally on NFS or so?
2014-01-08T00:19:59 <Bosmon8> colinclark - great
2014-01-08T00:20:00 <colinclark> So it must have been the case that she had an old version of Infusion
2014-01-08T00:20:03 <Bosmon8> ok
2014-01-08T00:20:10 <Bosmon8> Shame we can\'t find out what version she has
2014-01-08T00:20:11 <Bosmon8> had
2014-01-08T00:20:30 <avtar> Bosmon8: creating a package seemed like a better approach than sharing the fs using nfs
2014-01-08T00:20:33 <colinclark> I recommended that she, when reviewing changes that include new versions of dependencies in package.json, always delete the old version and run npm install again
2014-01-08T00:20:35 <michelled> colinclark: once you have the system running, how do you shut it down properly?
2014-01-08T00:20:47 <Bosmon8> michelled - CTRL-C :)
2014-01-08T00:20:48 <colinclark> CTRL-C
2014-01-08T00:20:49 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-08T00:20:51 <colinclark> it\'s awsome
2014-01-08T00:20:51 <michelled> ok
2014-01-08T00:20:56 <colinclark> awesome
2014-01-08T00:21:11 <Bosmon8> colinclark - hadn\'t she already got into that workflow? : P
2014-01-08T00:21:24 <michelled> so, the pull request I merged in didn\'t have any changes to package.json
2014-01-08T00:21:32 <colinclark> michelled: that\'s particularly weird
2014-01-08T00:21:41 <colinclark> after my holiday, I\'ve become immensely distrustful of npm
2014-01-08T00:21:59 <Bosmon8> michelled - which pull request was it?
2014-01-08T00:22:16 <michelled> 180
2014-01-08T00:22:28 <colinclark> and I\'m also distrustful of the fact that for vague and unspecified reasons, we still use Node 0.8.x on Windows
2014-01-08T00:22:32 <michelled> so, Bosmon8 what\'s the best practise when testing a pull to universal?
2014-01-08T00:22:41 <michelled> I currently have a clean and working system
2014-01-08T00:22:50 <Bosmon8> michelled - surely this was exactly what I was asking you and the team earlier :)
2014-01-08T00:24:05 <michelled> I\'m going to fetch yzen\'s branch, merge it in, run nom install (even though there are no changes to package.json)
2014-01-08T00:24:18 <michelled> then start up the system and try out timothy\'s usb
2014-01-08T00:24:23 <michelled> does that sound reasonable?
2014-01-08T00:24:35 <Bosmon8> It\'s because I couldn\'t really lay my hands on any very usable best practices I was reluctant to review the pull requests : P
2014-01-08T00:24:40 <Bosmon8> Yes
2014-01-08T00:24:57 <Bosmon8> And you\'re on Windows now?
2014-01-08T00:25:10 <Bosmon8> And for these reasons still can\'t expect to run KASPARNET\'s acceptance tests?
2014-01-08T00:25:19 * jhung has quit
2014-01-08T00:25:21 <colinclark> nom nom install
2014-01-08T00:26:26 <avtar> colinclark: have you tried this package manager for windows? http://chocolatey.org/
2014-01-08T00:26:36 <colinclark> No, I haven\'t
2014-01-08T00:26:44 <colinclark> I was going to ask you about it once
2014-01-08T00:27:14 <michelled> Bosmon8: yes
2014-01-08T00:27:51 <michelled> Bosmon8: if I\'ve only merged in something new to universal, I don\'t need to rebuild in the windows directory, do I?
2014-01-08T00:27:52 <Bosmon8> michelled - I would try a couple of users via the web interface too
2014-01-08T00:28:02 <Bosmon8> michelled - no
2014-01-08T00:28:12 <Bosmon8> By rebuild you mean an npm install or so?
2014-01-08T00:28:20 <Bosmon8> We don\'t really yet have "builds" in GPII
2014-01-08T00:28:26 <avtar> colinclark: it appears to have packages for most of the dependencies listed on the gpii wiki
2014-01-08T00:28:31 <Bosmon8> Just a half-assed bunch of shell scripts that check things out in a particular arrangement : P
2014-01-08T00:28:43 <colinclark> oh, grunt
2014-01-08T00:28:57 <colinclark> some day we will be cursing you, like we curse npm now
2014-01-08T00:28:58 <michelled> I mean running the "build.cmd" which seems to clone universal if it doesn\'t exist and run nom install
2014-01-08T00:28:59 <avtar> node 0.10.24 though
2014-01-08T00:29:03 <colinclark> nom nom nom
2014-01-08T00:29:11 <Bosmon8> nom nom :)
2014-01-08T00:29:17 <colinclark> avtar: I think we probably should consider this
2014-01-08T00:29:21 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-08T00:29:35 <colinclark> actually
2014-01-08T00:29:36 <Bosmon8> michelled - I don\'t think I\'ve ever run the build.cmd script except when testing build.cmd itself : P
2014-01-08T00:29:37 <colinclark> you know
2014-01-08T00:29:54 <colinclark> michelled: I do sometimes use it
2014-01-08T00:29:54 <Bosmon8> But this is mostly because I keep my checkout in a non-standard arrangement just to demonstrate that it is still possible
2014-01-08T00:30:06 <colinclark> but generally only in context of blasting the top-level node_modules directory and re-running it
2014-01-08T00:30:11 <colinclark> avtar: Actually
2014-01-08T00:30:23 <colinclark> So, I was thinking in the case of the Linux problems I faced
2014-01-08T00:30:39 <colinclark> that we might want to stop embracing "whatever\'s in the distribution\'s package manager"
2014-01-08T00:30:39 <Bosmon8> This is because I still someday dream of a fix for http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3 :)
2014-01-08T00:30:55 <Bosmon8> But our architecture is only so old so it is impossible for JIRAs to be older than 18 months
2014-01-08T00:31:04 <colinclark> avtar: is it tedious to produce yum and ubuntu packages for things like Node.js and some of our other dependencies
2014-01-08T00:31:16 <colinclark> and, for that matter "choclatey" packages
2014-01-08T00:31:22 <colinclark> chocolatey
2014-01-08T00:31:59 <colinclark> I think in general you have to be quite vigilant for changes to package.json anywhere in our infrastructure, michelled
2014-01-08T00:32:12 <colinclark> which I think, practically, means universal, windows, linux, and android
2014-01-08T00:32:26 <colinclark> I think the best practice should be to blast, then npm install
2014-01-08T00:32:43 <colinclark> since I\'m not convinced that all versions of npm are smart enough to recognize changes in a git-tracked dependency
2014-01-08T00:33:08 <Bosmon8> colinclark - I believe that none of them are
2014-01-08T00:33:13 <Bosmon8> At least, I\'ve never seen one that was
2014-01-08T00:34:15 <Bosmon8> I guess I should reword that "cannot init component" diagnostic slightly
2014-01-08T00:34:31 <Bosmon8> It\'s not completely unhelpful, but it\'s not completely helpful either
2014-01-08T00:45:50 <avtar> colinclark: here\'s an fpm example https://github.com/disqus/fpm-recipes/blob/master/keepalived/Makefile similar to what we just discussed
2014-01-08T00:46:14 <colinclark> Bosmon8: How might you reword it?
2014-01-08T00:47:11 <avtar> they (disqus) only generate deb packages https://github.com/disqus/fpm-recipes/blob/master/include/base.mk#L64-L69
2014-01-08T00:47:29 <avtar> but a similar approach could be used to create debs and rpms
2014-01-08T00:47:36 <avtar> not sure about windows though
2014-01-08T00:48:34 <colinclark> avtar: I just pinged you on a Github issue
2014-01-08T00:48:53 <colinclark> Bosmon8 has pointed out the challenge of actually testing a CORS-related fix that yzen made
2014-01-08T00:49:03 <colinclark> I wonder if it\'s something you\'d be able to easily help michelled test?
2014-01-08T00:49:28 <colinclark> Have you deployed the Cloud-based Flow Manager before?
2014-01-08T00:50:42 <Bosmon8> colinclark - the revised message might say, "The grade hierarchy of component Xxxxx is incomplete - most likely, a file declaring one of the grades [aaaaa, bbbb, cccc] is missing, outdated, or corrupt"
2014-01-08T00:50:53 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-08T00:51:22 <colinclark> I\'m trying to think if there\'s anyway to detect multiple Infusion instances in a Kettle app
2014-01-08T00:51:31 <Bosmon8> colinclark there is, yes
2014-01-08T00:51:37 <Bosmon8> And I remember suggesting that yzen actually do this : P
2014-01-08T00:51:40 <colinclark> aha
2014-01-08T00:51:51 <colinclark> where\'s the point at which it needs to be done, though?
2014-01-08T00:52:07 <Bosmon8> It should be sufficient to do it at the point kettle initialises
2014-01-08T00:52:23 <Bosmon8> Clearly we don\'t need to cater for perverse cases like continuously self-modifying filesystems : P
2014-01-08T00:52:35 <Bosmon8> The only issue.... is where to STOP
2014-01-08T00:52:49 <Bosmon8> Which brings in a lot of the discussions we had in Linz about our need for a custom module loader
2014-01-08T00:53:05 <colinclark> yes, I remember those discussions quite well
2014-01-08T00:53:25 <colinclark> we have quite a lot of work ahead of us :)
2014-01-08T00:53:38 <colinclark> it\'s nice to have michelled helping us with it
2014-01-08T00:53:51 <Bosmon8> Yes, it is great
2014-01-08T00:54:54 <Bosmon8> I remember that the starting point for a lot of our plans would be a specially named file, which had the signification - "for all compliant node_modules below this point in the FS, load EVERYTHING"
2014-01-08T00:55:15 <Bosmon8> Which would later be refined to "Behave AS IF you had loaded everything"
2014-01-08T00:55:21 <avtar> colinclark: i see it now
