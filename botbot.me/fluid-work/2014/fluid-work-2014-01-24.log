2014-01-24T15:24:57 <Justin_o_> michelled: you can look at this yes page i have up http://jobara.github.io/infusion/
2014-01-24T15:26:37 <Justin_o_> michelled: however, the submodule only pulls in when the page is built, so if you update the code beneath it, it won't update automatically. You have to push that change up to the gh-pages repo :( so it doesn't look like we can pull it in live.. i still haven't heard back from github about how to do this..  so they may reply with some ideas, but it sounds
2014-01-24T15:26:37 <Justin_o_> like we'll have to source the live code from elsewhere
2014-01-24T15:27:37 <michelled> cool!
2014-01-24T15:42:23 <Justin_o_> michelled: do you know if GPII-75 made it into the review2 branch?
2014-01-24T15:42:32 <michelled> yep it did :)
2014-01-24T15:42:48 <Justin_o_> michelled: okay thanks
2014-01-24T15:42:56 <michelled> it might even be in master - I can't remember
2014-01-24T15:43:25 <michelled> Justin_o_: can you start working on putting up the bare bones sites for metadata, VP and ET?
2014-01-24T15:44:13 <Justin_o_> michelled: okay.. what would the bare bones consist of?
2014-01-24T15:44:49 <michelled> honestly, I just want to be able to point to those demos
2014-01-24T15:45:55 <Justin_o_> michelled: i can do that, is it okay if they are static versions and don't update?
2014-01-24T15:46:01 <michelled> yes
2014-01-24T15:46:11 <Justin_o_> and you don't care about the url right?
2014-01-24T15:46:13 <michelled> we'll address that issue later
2014-01-24T15:46:26 <michelled> yes, that's true too - for now ;)
2014-01-24T15:46:46 <Justin_o_> michelled: :) okay
2014-01-24T15:47:50 <Justin_o_> i'll put this all in the build.fluidproject.org repo space for now
2014-01-24T15:48:02 <Justin_o_> michelled: ^
2014-01-24T15:49:01 <michelled> sounds good Justin_o_
2014-01-24T15:53:52 <Justin_o_> michelled: filed a new jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5259

2014-01-24T16:31:59 <anastasiac> michelled, avtar, are you joining stand-up today?
2014-01-24T16:33:01 <avtar> anastasiac: i am
2014-01-24T16:45:58 <Justin_o_> michelled: here's what i have for the barebones site.. it's in my fork for now.. let me know what you think http://jobara.github.io/build.fluidproject.org/
2014-01-24T16:46:20 <Justin_o_> i imagine for now we'll just be linking directly to the demos
2014-01-24T16:49:40 <Justin_o_> michelled: looks like the text-to-speech in the exploration tool doesn't work.. probably related to cors support
2014-01-24T16:50:39 <Justin_o_> michelled: i take that back.. it was an issue with my audio
2014-01-24T16:59:53 <michelled> Justin_o_: thanks! this is perfect for bare bones :)

2014-01-24T21:46:15 <michelled> hello Bosmon! I'm actually not staying long, but anastasiac was working on getting rid of some demands in the video player any might need to bounce some questions off you :)
2014-01-24T21:47:58 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-24T21:48:31 <anastasiac> Bosmon, still formulating questions. I learn better when I try and fail than when someone just tells me the right answer
2014-01-24T21:49:02 <Bosmon> anastasiac - cool - try away ;)
