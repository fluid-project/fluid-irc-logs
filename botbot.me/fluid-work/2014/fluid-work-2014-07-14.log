2014-07-14T17:15:52 <jhung> anastasiac: I do not see a Handbook component under Floe in Jira. I didn\'t find one under Fluid either. Is there a component?
2014-07-14T17:16:08 <anastasiac> hm
2014-07-14T17:17:08 <anastasiac> jhung, Fluid has a "Design Handbook" component that we seem to be using for the ILDH
2014-07-14T17:17:30 * slim_ has quit
2014-07-14T17:18:50 <jhung> anastasiac: got it. This is interesting because EPUB is under Floe project and ILDH is under Fluid. I\'ll file the ToC task under ILDH.
2014-07-14T18:01:38 <jhung> anastasiac: I updated the table of contents for handbook.floeproject.org and pushed it to my repo. Should I issue a pull request for the development branch?
2014-07-14T18:01:49 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, that sounds good
2014-07-14T18:02:38 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: did anyone have an opinion about the e-mails i sent to fluid-work last week about using normalize.css and the css preprocessors.. in particular for the feedback work.. i\'m thinking of using normalize.css (not sure how much i need it yet).. any thoughts?
2014-07-14T18:02:45 <jhung> anastasiac: pull req added https://github.com/fluid-project/handbook.floeproject.org/pull/12

2014-07-14T20:13:36 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli!
2014-07-14T20:16:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: thanks for your comments on my pull request for FLOE-171
2014-07-14T20:17:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: one comment is, "I think as we discussed during our original review, the particular transformation required for this application is too complex for any variant of a "condition" transform and should really be implemented in terms of a, or the, "valueMapper". Processing nested conditions etc. has led to a greatly increased complexity in the definitions and all of the machinery required to process and invert them, etc."
2014-07-14T20:17:44 <cindyli> are you suggesting that condition transform should be avoid, instead, use "valueMapper"?
2014-07-14T20:18:16 <cindyli> i was using "valueMapper" to invert the conditional transform
2014-07-14T20:18:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, it appears that the transform itself would be better expressed as value mapping
2014-07-14T20:18:53 <Bosmon> The two nested conditionals are extremely unwieldy
2014-07-14T20:19:42 <cindyli> ok, i will give a try to use valueMapper only, Bosmon
2014-07-14T20:20:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks
2014-07-14T20:20:18 <Bosmon> The inversion rule should be much simpler too
2014-07-14T20:21:27 <cindyli> agree if valueMapper achieves the same goal. :) we\'ll see. thanks, Bosmon
2014-07-14T20:22:34 <Bosmon> cindyli - if it doesn\'t, I\'ll fix the framework\'s inversion

2014-07-14T21:50:51 <jhernandez> quick question
2014-07-14T21:51:23 <jhernandez> under linux, are all acceptance tests running well there?
2014-07-14T21:51:42 <Bosmon> Not in my opinion
2014-07-14T21:51:50 <Bosmon> I will look at them tomorrow in more detail
2014-07-14T21:51:53 <Bosmon> But for me they are failing
2014-07-14T21:52:15 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-14T21:52:26 <jhernandez> testing os_win7?
2014-07-14T21:52:32 <Bosmon> right
2014-07-14T21:52:34 <Bosmon> That one
2014-07-14T21:52:50 <jhernandez> ok

2014-07-14T21:55:32 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-07-14T21:55:35 <Bosmon> What is the funny thing?
2014-07-14T21:56:00 <jhernandez> it\'s weird that settings are being applied well, but data.expected has wrong values
2014-07-14T21:56:05 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-07-14T21:56:10 <Bosmon> It is a race condition, I expect
2014-07-14T21:56:24 * jhernandez nods
2014-07-14T21:57:18 <jhernandez> happening the same on windows?
2014-07-14T21:57:25 <Bosmon> I don\'t think so
2014-07-14T21:57:46 <Bosmon> But I think it is just an inconsistent issue caused by non-deterministic sorting of event handlers
2014-07-14T21:59:05 <jhernandez> btw, universal\'s all-tests.js are also failing here
2014-07-14T21:59:07 <jhernandez> :/

2014-07-14T12:29:30 <amilchev> hi jhernandez
2014-07-14T12:29:46 <amilchev> quick question about testing PMT/PCP with universal:master
2014-07-14T12:31:16 <amilchev> I\'ve been using pilots2 branch of universal for quite a while now and recently me and Justin_o realized that "save & apply" fails to log the new user in (when testing with universal:master)
2014-07-14T12:31:53 <amilchev> do you know what value should be set to NODE_ENV? anything else we\'re missing?
2014-07-14T12:31:54 <amilchev> jhernandez ^
2014-07-14T12:36:35 <jhernandez> amilchev: hmm
2014-07-14T12:36:38 <jhernandez> dunno
2014-07-14T12:37:14 <jhernandez> perhaps it\'s because the master branch is missing something from pilots2 branch
2014-07-14T12:37:17 <jhernandez> not sure
2014-07-14T12:38:05 <jhernandez> I\'m not aware of all the differences between pilots2 and master branches
2014-07-14T12:38:41 <jhernandez> but AFAIK, there are a few "tricks" to make the PMT/PCP work properly
2014-07-14T12:39:27 <jhernandez> amilchev: now I\'m heading lunch
2014-07-14T12:39:55 <jhernandez> but if you want, I can give it a try here in my laptop after lunch
2014-07-14T12:40:13 <amilchev> jhernandez just asked if you\'re aware of anything specific
2014-07-14T12:40:21 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-07-14T12:40:23 <jhernandez> not sure
2014-07-14T12:40:29 <jhernandez> (at least right now)
2014-07-14T12:40:45 <jhernandez> are you both getting the same problems?
2014-07-14T12:41:51 <jhernandez> my first thought is, what config(s) are you using to run the gpii?
2014-07-14T12:42:44 <jhernandez> just development?
2014-07-14T12:42:51 <jhernandez> development means, local prefs server
2014-07-14T12:42:52 <amilchev> not sure if we\'re getting the same problems - we just tried it out and both failed to log the user in, we haven\'t investigated any further
2014-07-14T12:43:17 <jhernandez> perhaps you might prefer to use the production environment instead
2014-07-14T12:43:43 <jhernandez> this is, by running NODE_ENV=fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.production node gpii.js
2014-07-14T12:44:48 <amilchev> jhernandez hm I\'ll try this out
2014-07-14T12:44:54 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-14T12:45:04 <jhernandez> let me know how it goes
2014-07-14T12:45:12 <amilchev> thanks and have a nice lunch : )
2014-07-14T12:45:13 <amilchev> sure
2014-07-14T12:45:20 <jhernandez> brb 45 mins
2014-07-14T12:45:25 <jhernandez> thanks!

2014-07-14T13:31:37 <amilchev> jhernandez for starters I think io.json should be added to FM configs (otherwise kettle servers aren\'t running at all), thus production.json for FM won\'t work for us for sure..
2014-07-14T13:33:37 <amilchev> I guess I\'ll need to thoroughly go through all differences that pilot2.json brings (compared to other configs) and figure out what needs to be added
2014-07-14T13:35:18 <amilchev> I have to leave office now..btw there\'s no need for you to investigate this etc, didn\'t mean to take any of your time
2014-07-14T13:35:49 <amilchev> just asked if you know anything specific about what\'s wrong and where
2014-07-14T13:36:20 <amilchev> so thx anyway : )

2014-07-14T13:42:47 <jhernandez> amilchev: ok

2014-07-14T14:42:45 <jhernandez> not sure
2014-07-14T14:43:12 <jhernandez> couldn\'t get time to start looking at the "testing" requirements
2014-07-14T14:43:23 <jhernandez> sorry
2014-07-14T14:43:50 <jhernandez> I\'ve been mostly working on "USB provisioning"
2014-07-14T14:43:52 <clown> are the "testing" requirements written down anywhere?
2014-07-14T14:43:57 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-07-14T14:44:07 <clown> right, you\'re very busy with USB.  I remember now.

2014-07-14T14:44:52 <clown> I know Bosmon7 was unconvinced that using the tuxguitar package was a good idea.

2014-07-14T15:28:08 <jhernandez> I heard that expression while watching "the wire"

2014-07-14T16:08:02 <danaayotte> anastasiac, I noticed that the link to Learner Options from floeproject.org is broken (the url needs updating/correcting)
2014-07-14T16:08:18 <anastasiac> !!
2014-07-14T16:09:13 <anastasiac> thanks, danaayotte. There may be other places that are broken after the directory restructuring. Justin_o, we\'ll have to fix those!
2014-07-14T16:09:25 <anastasiac> I\'ll file a JIRA for this one
2014-07-14T16:09:32 <danaayotte> cool
2014-07-14T16:12:06 <anastasiac> danaayotte, Justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-199
2014-07-14T16:13:18 <anastasiac> The build site look sok
2014-07-14T16:14:06 <anastasiac> fluidproject.org is still pointing to 1.4 ...
2014-07-14T16:14:24 <danaayotte> also anastasiac - it looks like that mobile/iPhone horizontal scrolling issue i mentioned is a problem with the UIO panel, because it happens with the NOAA demo as well as with the Outside-In site (panel doesn\'t scroll independently of page)
2014-07-14T16:14:50 <anastasiac> aha, good to know, danaayotte. There might actually be a JIRA for that already, then.
2014-07-14T16:15:38 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-07-14T16:18:07 <danaayotte> I can\'t find anything anastasiac, except the one I created for Outside-In page (IDI-139).  Let me know if you want me to modify that one to be more generally about the UIO panel
2014-07-14T16:18:24 <anastasiac> ok, thanks danaayotte, I\'ll check
2014-07-14T16:19:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: fludiproject.org will be fixed with the new site
2014-07-14T16:19:45 <anastasiac> yeah, I figured
