2014-12-14T12:41:13 <kasparnet> morning Bosmon
2014-12-14T12:41:52 <kasparnet> just to update you on what we\'re doing and why we\'re spamming universal with pull requests:
2014-12-14T12:42:37 <kasparnet> We\'re going through the review scenario from start to finish (or well.. at least we\'re at the start), merging all the required stuff into a review3 branch (right now living in my repo - soon living in GPII project)
2014-12-14T12:43:03 <kasparnet> To make the branch as non-horrific as possible we\'re tracking all the differences here: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1044
2014-12-14T12:43:16 <Bosmon> Hey there KASPARRDDDNETT :)
2014-12-14T12:43:58 <kasparnet> So several of the new pull requests arent fit for review yet (though some of them, like Javi\'s XML one and kettle ref are)
2014-12-14T12:44:25 <Bosmon> I\'ve supplied comments on the XML one
2014-12-14T12:44:36 <kasparnet> yup - just saw it - jhernandez is answering right now
2014-12-14T12:44:51 <kasparnet> or, at least he\'s commenting on the JIRA
2014-12-14T12:45:33 <kasparnet> it\'s insane how many loose ends there are, so mostly it\'s just gonna be pull request spamming today, monday and tuesday
2014-12-14T12:45:40 <kasparnet> after that the cleanup will begin
2014-12-14T12:45:41 <Bosmon> Ok cool
2014-12-14T12:45:51 <Bosmon> I\'ll try to review as many as I can
2014-12-14T12:46:02 <Bosmon> but you should feel free to just merge stuff like the kettle ref yourselves
2014-12-14T12:46:16 <jhernandez> Bosmon: just commented on the XML jira
2014-12-14T12:46:28 <Bosmon> Similarly for things like obvious docu fixes
2014-12-14T12:46:42 <jhernandez> and good morning btw ...
2014-12-14T12:46:47 <Bosmon> Thanks guys for being so ENNERGETTICK!
2014-12-14T12:47:10 <kasparnet> ok cheers - but we\'re trying to keep the master branch untouched - I think we\'re in the semi-sloppy GET \'ER DONE mode, so touching anything master is a scary (and error prone) thought
2014-12-14T12:47:20 <kasparnet> ... we\'ve had wine for breakfast :S
2014-12-14T12:47:42 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I think we\'re going for some real breakfast/lunch now
2014-12-14T12:48:20 <Bosmon> cool, I will get some of my own
2014-12-14T12:49:01 <kasparnet> coolio  - talk to you later!
2014-12-14T12:49:10 <kasparnet> oh, btw, when is simon arriving? I guess today?!
2014-12-14T12:51:00 <Bosmon> Well, I\'ve expected him at any moment
2014-12-14T12:51:08 <Bosmon> I can only guess he has stopped for a lunch of his own
2014-12-14T12:51:23 <Bosmon> But I have been keeping some croissants proving for him in the oven...
2014-12-14T12:51:39 <Bosmon> Which has been carefully taped shut to prevent that etternal ennemy, ***THER CATTT*** from getting inside and raiding them
2014-12-14T13:31:22 <kasparnet> haha

2014-12-14T14:42:33 <kasparnet> Bosmon: if you at some point have time, a 10 minute skkype conversation might be nice - we\'re stuck with an IoC vs global value issue with the socket handler
2014-12-14T15:35:00 <windowsbox> kasparnet, http://pastie.org/9779998#8,14,20,26-27,41-42,74,80,86,92-93,107-108

2014-12-14T16:11:07 <Bosmon> hi KASPARNETT :)
2014-12-14T16:11:11 <Bosmon> Who on earth is this BOXX : P
2014-12-14T16:12:07 * windowsbox has quit
2014-12-14T16:13:49 <kasparnet> it\'s the windows computer
2014-12-14T16:14:13 <kasparnet> ... for cross computer copy/pasting :)
2014-12-14T16:15:34 <kasparnet> did Mr. Bates arrive?
2014-12-14T16:17:38 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so we were planning on going through the scenarios today, fixing the things that need fixing so we could at least do a half-assed walkthrough tomorrow
2014-12-14T16:17:46 <kasparnet> .. turns out nothing is working
2014-12-14T16:17:47 <kasparnet> NOTHING
2014-12-14T16:17:48 <kasparnet> :D
2014-12-14T16:28:47 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-12-14T16:39:24 <Bosmon> Hey there
2014-12-14T16:39:45 <Bosmon> Yes, that worthy BBATES has arrived!
2014-12-14T16:40:14 <Bosmon> Hay kasparnet
2014-12-14T16:40:20 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon
2014-12-14T16:40:26 <Bosmon> So can I help out?
2014-12-14T16:40:34 <kasparnet> no - I think we figured it out
2014-12-14T16:40:51 <kasparnet> ... it\'s a bit hacky, but not too bad I think
2014-12-14T16:41:00 <Bosmon> What was the problem
2014-12-14T16:41:03 <kasparnet> thanks though
2014-12-14T16:41:23 <kasparnet> well - it was getting a hold of IoC\'d stuff from the socket settingshandler
2014-12-14T16:43:03 <kasparnet> you talked a bit about it on friday (or whenever) from what I remember
2014-12-14T16:43:16 * colinclark has quit
2014-12-14T16:43:29 <Bosmon> Oh right
2014-12-14T16:43:33 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s tough
2014-12-14T16:43:41 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-12-14T16:43:51 <Bosmon> The only reasonable method is to "inject" it from the other side, from the IoC tree into carefully named globals
2014-12-14T16:44:08 <kasparnet> yup - that\'s what we ended up with as well I believe
2014-12-14T16:44:11 <Bosmon> And put big comments on it explaining what a worrying thing this is : P
2014-12-14T16:45:05 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-12-14T16:50:36 <Bosmon> great
2014-12-14T16:50:47 <Bosmon> I have to say, kasparnet, your latest few PUL requests have been really marvellous
2014-12-14T16:50:57 <Bosmon> So great to have such clear and well-formatted docs
2014-12-14T16:51:08 <kasparnet> thanks so much, Bosmon!!
