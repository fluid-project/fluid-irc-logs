2014-06-06T14:07:30 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\'m fully booked trying to finish up the websavvy evaluation, unfortunately
2014-06-06T14:07:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: no problem.. thanks anyways

2014-06-06T14:26:10 <cindyli> Justin_o and jhung, for the fat panel, the change on the line spacing doesn\'t seem affect the UIO iframe panel itself even though the inspector shows the new line height has been applied to the iframe body element.
2014-06-06T14:26:31 <cindyli> one reason, apparently not all, is \'cuz of this line: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/css/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.css#L28
2014-06-06T14:27:35 <cindyli> we don\'t seem to have an existing jira for this. Before creating a new jira, i wonder if there\'s a historic reason for this and it is intentional. Do you guys have some ideas?
2014-06-06T14:27:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: if any line-height is provided on an element, the one supplied through the prefs framework won\'t work
2014-06-06T14:28:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m not sure, but that line of code you mentioned seems to indicate that it was intentional.. perhaps jhung would know more
2014-06-06T14:29:06 <jhung> cindyli: there may be a work-around for this. I don\'t have a link handy to the fat-panel, can you paste a link?
2014-06-06T14:29:22 <cindyli> jhung: http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/html/prefsEditorSeparatedPanel.html
2014-06-06T14:30:00 * danaayotte has left the channel
2014-06-06T14:34:47 <jhung> cindyli: yes this is intentional. We have to do similar for the OverviewPanel component as well. Unfortunately line spacing causes havoc on things that are absolutely or fixed in a position.
2014-06-06T14:35:12 <cindyli> cool. good to know, jhung. thanks.
2014-06-06T14:35:43 <jhung> (I thought the fat-panel was the design where the panel stacked vertical and occupied half the screen? My memory may be fuzzy).
2014-06-06T14:36:54 * clown joined the channel
2014-06-06T14:37:05 <cindyli> really? i don\'t think so but not very sure.
2014-06-06T14:46:55 <jhung> I just came across the strangest bug in IE11. I can drag the text-size slider off its rail and out of the browser chrome. Releasing the mouse button outside the browser window causes the Prefs Framework demo page to go blank.
2014-06-06T14:53:49 <Justin_o> jhung: whoa that\'s weird
2014-06-06T14:54:26 <Justin_o> jhung: can you check if that\'s a bug with jQuery UI sliders in general.. it might be hard to tell if it requires an iframe
2014-06-06T14:54:41 <jhung> ok Justin_o
2014-06-06T14:54:48 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-06-06T15:15:46 <jhung> Justin_o: it happens with jquery\'s slider demo too. It looks like IE thinks you\'re making a shortcut on your desktop.
2014-06-06T15:16:12 <Justin_o> oh interesting.. does that happen with any link then?
2014-06-06T15:16:16 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2014-06-06T15:17:07 <jhung> Justin_o: yep it seems like it.
2014-06-06T15:17:52 <Justin_o> jhung: oh well.. i guess we\'ll need to file that, but i wonder if there is anything we could actually do
2014-06-06T15:18:28 <jhung> Justin_o: probably not. I\'ll file it and I\'ll see if I can find an existing ticket for it.
2014-06-06T15:18:38 <Justin_o> jhung: great, thanks

2014-06-06T16:05:00 <jhung> Justin_o: I can\'t seem to reproduce this bug anymore. Go figure. Not sure what I did to "fix it". I can still drag the slider around and even make a short-cut, but at least the demo page doesn\'t go blank anymore. Not sure if it\'s worth filing a bug for this.
2014-06-06T16:06:06 <Justin_o> i\'d guess it was going blank because it was trying to follow the link, but i\'m not sure..
2014-06-06T16:06:12 <Justin_o> maybe you had clicked on the shortcut?
2014-06-06T16:06:14 <Justin_o> jhung:  ^
2014-06-06T16:13:35 <jhung> Justin_o: perhaps? either way I can\'t seem to reproduce the page blanking behaviour. Oh well.  I\'ll leave this unfiled since I think this is expected behaviour in IE (you can shortcut any link)
2014-06-06T16:14:47 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2014-06-06T16:15:23 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, after you finish up with the tasks that you have your name down for currently, feel free to switch back to the site
2014-06-06T16:15:53 <jhung> will do Justin_o. btw, I assume we need to test the exploration tool too?
2014-06-06T16:16:28 <Justin_o> jhung: it\'s not actually part of infusion, but you can test it too if you like.
2014-06-06T16:16:50 <jhung> ok
2014-06-06T16:24:29 <jhung> Justin_o: simplify content seems to be broken in IE8.
2014-06-06T16:24:37 <Justin_o> really :(
2014-06-06T16:24:41 <Justin_o> what\'s the problem?
2014-06-06T16:26:26 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2014-06-06T16:27:09 <jhung> Turning it on or off doesn\'t do anything Justin_o. I looked for a jira and didn\'t come across anything. So this may be something new.
2014-06-06T16:28:06 <Justin_o> jhung: ah i see, it just removes the background :(
2014-06-06T16:28:16 <Justin_o> yes, you should file that one, and make it critical for now please
2014-06-06T16:28:18 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2014-06-06T16:29:19 * michelled has quit
2014-06-06T16:29:44 <jhung> ok Justin_o. I was in contrast mode, so I didn\'t see the background changing. I\'ll file a jira
