2014-10-07T18:18:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i'm looking at the assorted content manual test for the preferences framework. It seems that this was highly dependent on FSS
2014-10-07T18:18:11 <Justin_o> http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/#
2014-10-07T18:18:43 <anastasiac> ah, that old thing!
2014-10-07T18:19:08 <Justin_o> I'm wondering what we want this manual test to show and how to best do that
2014-10-07T18:20:55 <anastasiac> The goal of this page was to throw a whole lot of different types of content at UIO and make sure UIO could handle it: links, forms, columns, colours, tabs, buttons, icons, tables, images\xe2\x80\xa6 I threw in as many different types of things as I could come up with.
2014-10-07T18:22:04 <anastasiac> at the time, Justin_o, part of the goal was to test some of our FSS-specific widgets, like our tabs and our actual \xe2\x80\x9cwidget\xe2\x80\x9d. Obviously, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do that anymore.
2014-10-07T18:22:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: right that's true.. we won't need that :)
2014-10-07T18:23:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay so two question 1) do we need this manual test anymore 2) if we do, should we build it using a framework like foundation (possibly a second test using bootstrap), or by hand
2014-10-07T18:24:39 <anastasiac> good questions, Justin_o. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the answer(s).
2014-10-07T18:27:10 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: anyone else have any thoughts on this?
2014-10-07T18:29:51 <michelled> Justin_o: I think we need this test
2014-10-07T18:30:00 <michelled> I'm undecided whether it should use a framework or not
2014-10-07T18:30:17 <michelled> I mean, if UIO doesn't play nicely with plain old HTML we are *not* in good shape
2014-10-07T18:30:22 <michelled> so maybe hand built is best?
2014-10-07T18:30:31 <michelled> what are your thoughts?
2014-10-07T18:31:43 <Justin_o> michelled: that's true, so maybe a simplified demo that has styles made from the various html5 elements
2014-10-07T18:32:21 <Justin_o> michelled: in terms of the frameworks, i think we may eventually want to make a file or version of the themes that works with foundation and one that works with bootstrap. At that time we should probably have a manual test for it
2014-10-07T18:32:25 <Justin_o> how does that sound?
2014-10-07T18:32:45 <michelled> that makes sense to me Justin_o
2014-10-07T18:33:43 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac: okay, so i'm going to remake this demo.. and focus on using html5 elements. I'll try to get in as many as is reasonable. It will probably look a lot different from this at the end.
2014-10-07T18:34:17 <michelled> that's fine
2014-10-07T18:34:38 <michelled> you'll need to update the manual test read me so people know how to test it

2014-10-07T18:36:04 <Justin_o> michelled: that's gone now, we have those in page descriptions, the one for this page was fairly generic already
2014-10-07T18:36:17 <michelled> ah, right - that's great
