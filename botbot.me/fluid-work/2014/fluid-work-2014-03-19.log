2014-03-19T13:59:03 <clown> good morning jhernandez
2014-03-19T13:59:19 <clown> and/or good afternoon.
2014-03-19T14:31:24 <jhernandez> clown: morning
2014-03-19T14:31:29 <jhernandez> (afternoon here, yeah)
2014-03-19T14:31:30 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-19T14:33:39 <clown> I\'m close, jhernandez.
2014-03-19T14:34:00 <clown> I have a getPackages() method that will return arrays of packages as JSON objects.
2014-03-19T14:34:17 <clown> But, I \'m not sure it is obeying the filter \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s what I\'m testing now.
2014-03-19T14:34:59 <jhernandez> wow!!!
2014-03-19T14:35:08 <clown> pastebin coming up.
2014-03-19T14:35:09 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-19T14:36:10 <jhernandez> ok, I\'m sitting down here again after having lunch
2014-03-19T14:36:25 <jhernandez> (coffee in hand) :)
2014-03-19T14:37:17 <clown> the paste is big, and pastebin doesn\'t like it.  :-(
2014-03-19T14:37:43 <jhernandez> shrink it
2014-03-19T14:37:55 <jhernandez> or is it a diff?
2014-03-19T14:38:13 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-03-19T14:38:17 <clown> It\'s debug outup showin what getPackages() returns.
2014-03-19T14:38:22 <clown> *output
2014-03-19T14:39:06 <clown> how do you shrink it?
2014-03-19T14:39:12 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-19T14:39:29 <jhernandez> just paste a few of them, not all
2014-03-19T14:39:33 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-19T14:39:49 <jhernandez> ie: those that are relevant

2014-03-19T14:44:39 * SonicX has quit
2014-03-19T14:47:06 <clown> jhernandez:  those arrays are HUGE.
2014-03-19T14:47:14 <clown> okay, here\'s a shrunk version:  http://paste.fedoraproject.org/86700/
2014-03-19T14:48:10 * clown should have cut out more...
2014-03-19T14:48:41 <clown> jhernandez:  let me know when you have it up in front of you, and I\'ll explain.
2014-03-19T14:49:32 * anomaly404 joined the channel
2014-03-19T14:57:17 <jhernandez> clown: ready
2014-03-19T14:57:48 <clown> jhernandez:  The first bit shows calling getPackages() with the installed filter.
2014-03-19T14:58:07 <clown> there are 1594 installed packages on my system, and I print out the first and last.
2014-03-19T14:58:09 <jhernandez> lovely :)
2014-03-19T14:58:36 <clown> Then I use our the searchPackage() to get the tuxguitar package, which is known to be uninstalled.
2014-03-19T14:58:56 <clown> Then, I call getPackages two more times, once with the installed filter, and once with the uninstalled filter.
2014-03-19T14:59:05 <clown> or "not installed" filter.
2014-03-19T14:59:34 <clown> then I list both arrays.  If you do a text search for \'tuxguitar\', you will see it only exists in the second list.
2014-03-19T15:00:02 <clown> The second list begins with a "Not installed:" at line 222.
2014-03-19T15:00:30 * jhernandez nods
2014-03-19T15:00:57 <clown> and tuxguitar is listsed in the not-installed array at 252.
2014-03-19T15:01:04 <clown> *listed
2014-03-19T15:01:05 <jhernandez> yes
2014-03-19T15:01:16 <jhernandez> the output looks good to me
2014-03-19T15:01:27 <clown> I need to tidy things up, but it\'s close.
2014-03-19T15:01:33 <jhernandez> cool!
2014-03-19T15:02:01 <clown> I don\'t think I"ll get it done before the arch meeting, but probably later today.
2014-03-19T15:02:14 <clown> And then I\'ll issue the pull request.
2014-03-19T15:02:29 <jhernandez> I\'m curious about the implementation ... but I can wait for the pull request :)
2014-03-19T15:02:53 <clown> okay.
2014-03-19T15:03:03 <jhernandez> AFAIK, today we won\'t have our weekly arch meeting
2014-03-19T15:03:25 <clown> oh?  Okay.  Whre is kasparnet?
2014-03-19T15:03:41 <clown> is he at csun too?
2014-03-19T15:03:54 <jhernandez> yeah

2014-03-19T16:49:28 <clown> Just looking for white space, and making sure I push to the right place on github.

2014-03-19T18:27:20 <jhung> Justin_o, simonjb: I was thinking of just commenting out the version number from the HTML markup and annotate it with the JIRA number. Do you think this is okay or should I remove the version number markup completely.
2014-03-19T18:27:40 * anomaly404 has left the channel
2014-03-19T18:30:33 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o: I think my preference would be to completely remove it -- in case it never gets added back, in which case we would have old code hanging around that isn\'t used and which needs to be maintained
2014-03-19T18:31:02 <Justin_o> jhung: i agree with simonjb
2014-03-19T18:31:13 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o: we could remove in one clean commit and add the commit hash to the JIRA -- then we can find it
2014-03-19T18:32:09 <jhung> simonjb, Justin_o: good point. I\'ll do that.
2014-03-19T18:32:12 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: let me know if you\'d like to join the community meeting remotely. We will be looking through Infusion and doing some pretesting in preparation for a future 1.5 release
2014-03-19T18:32:47 <simonjb> jhung: should I do it? there will be JS changes also
2014-03-19T18:34:10 <jhung> simonjb: that may make most sense.
2014-03-19T18:34:39 <simonjb> jhung: cool
2014-03-19T18:35:13 <simonjb> jhung: I will remove and send you the commit hash for you to add to the JIRA -- sound good?
