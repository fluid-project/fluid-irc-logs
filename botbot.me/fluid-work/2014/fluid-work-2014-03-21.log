2014-03-21T14:02:29 <clown> good day jhernandez.
2014-03-21T14:02:35 <clown> Thanks for the merge.
2014-03-21T14:08:50 <jhernandez> clown: grub morning!
2014-03-21T14:09:00 <jhernandez> thanks to you!
2014-03-21T14:09:01 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-21T14:12:05 <clown> grub?  Are you having trouble booting, or something?  :-)
2014-03-21T14:19:30 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-21T14:20:29 <jhernandez> nope, it was just a geek way for saying "good morning" :P
2014-03-21T14:20:30 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-03-21T14:25:54 <jhernandez> clown: btw
2014-03-21T14:26:17 <clown> yes?
2014-03-21T14:26:24 <jhernandez> just pushed a couple of commits to our packagekitBridge branch
2014-03-21T14:26:32 * clown looks
2014-03-21T14:29:29 * clown found extraneous whitespace in packageKitDeviceReporter.js  :-)
2014-03-21T14:33:32 <jhernandez> ?
2014-03-21T14:35:03 <jhernandez> oops
2014-03-21T14:35:04 <jhernandez> line 33
2014-03-21T14:35:40 <jhernandez> isn\'t it?
2014-03-21T14:35:58 * jhernandez fixing it up
2014-03-21T14:36:23 <clown> jhernandez, I did a git diff to see what the new/modified files were, and my git diff colourizes extra whitspace.  Lines 3, 5, and 8 of packageKitDeviceReporter.js have a space before the new line, and line 24 has a trailing space.
2014-03-21T14:37:00 <clown> and line 33, yes.
2014-03-21T14:37:38 <clown> whoops, forget line 24.
2014-03-21T14:38:41 <jhernandez> yup
2014-03-21T14:38:47 <jhernandez> I\'m about to commit it
2014-03-21T14:38:55 <jhernandez> thanks for realizing
2014-03-21T14:38:55 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-21T14:39:48 <jhernandez> now pushed
2014-03-21T14:39:49 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-21T14:43:27 <clown> pulled.
2014-03-21T14:45:03 <clown> do I need to build anything to try this out, jhernandez?
2014-03-21T14:45:45 * clown ran build.sh anyhow.
2014-03-21T14:49:07 <clown> the packageKitTests.js ran successfully here, jhernandez.

2014-03-21T15:06:42 <jhernandez> it\'s just a start, but the good one though
2014-03-21T15:06:44 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-21T15:08:04 <clown> when is the due date?
2014-03-21T15:08:06 <clown> :-)
2014-03-21T15:10:57 <clown> jhernandez, if I wanted to see the output in a web browser, what\'s the url?  Or is that not possible.

2014-03-21T19:13:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: hello... i\'m looking through FLUID-5284 right now.
2014-03-21T19:13:44 <colinclark> Hey Justin_o, what\'s new?
2014-03-21T19:13:51 <colinclark> ok, cool
2014-03-21T19:13:52 <Justin_o> linting :)
2014-03-21T19:14:19 <colinclark> awesome
2014-03-21T19:14:24 <Justin_o> it\'s gotten quite messy, which could be the result of not having our linting instance for a while, or the new rules being more strict.. it\'s probably a bit of both really
2014-03-21T19:14:30 <colinclark> ah yes
2014-03-21T19:15:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: so wondering about a couple things.. 1) do you remember what our thoughts on the "for in" is? I thought we didn\'t care about it, but we had it in our previous jslint comment
2014-03-21T19:15:26 <colinclark> The unfiltered for..in, you mean?
2014-03-21T19:15:32 <Justin_o> 2) do we need the jshint comments in each file.. initially i thought it was useful, but i\'m not completely sure.. we should have the global one per file though.
2014-03-21T19:15:36 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep
2014-03-21T19:15:39 <colinclark> i.e. not writing hasOwnProperty() everywhere?
2014-03-21T19:15:45 <Justin_o> http://jshint.com/docs/options/#forin
2014-03-21T19:15:49 <Justin_o> yes.. basically that
2014-03-21T19:15:59 <Justin_o> or exactly that
2014-03-21T19:16:17 <colinclark> We should definitely do "forin": false
2014-03-21T19:16:38 <colinclark> Justin_o: Let me just remind myself what JSHint does with comments in files
2014-03-21T19:16:44 <colinclark> I believe it "overlays" them
2014-03-21T19:16:55 <Justin_o> okay.. that\'s what i thought.. i guess our instance of jslint had just been ignoring our forin: true in the comment.. so strange
2014-03-21T19:17:02 <colinclark> in which case it seems perfectly sensible, if we\'ve got a grunt task for it, to only put file-specific directives in the comments
2014-03-21T19:17:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think my only argument for keeping them there is if someone wants to do dev work and linting without having to install node
2014-03-21T19:18:10 <Justin_o> although sublimelinter also picks up the jshintrc file config
2014-03-21T19:18:25 <Justin_o> so it\'s only for others who want to lint through the website i guess
2014-03-21T19:18:28 <colinclark> I think at this point, installing Node is pretty simple
2014-03-21T19:18:33 <colinclark> and every front end developer these days has it
2014-03-21T19:18:36 <colinclark> for Grunt or other things
2014-03-21T19:19:13 <colinclark> seems like the person who is developing without Node.js on their machine probably isn\'t going to be too troubled by a lack of jshinting
2014-03-21T19:19:31 <colinclark> I wonder if there is a similar Atom plugin
2014-03-21T19:19:34 <Justin_o> haha that\'s true.. although i\'d still like them to do it
2014-03-21T19:19:37 <colinclark> that sounds awesome
2014-03-21T19:19:37 <Justin_o> i think so
2014-03-21T19:19:55 <Justin_o> https://atom.io/packages/atom-jshint
2014-03-21T19:20:11 <colinclark> I don\'t think it\'s too much to ask a potential contributor to install Grunt in order to run JSHint
2014-03-21T19:20:25 <colinclark> not ideal, but honestly, asking them to cut and paste files into a web interface might be equally painful
2014-03-21T19:20:28 <colinclark> especially if plugins like this exist
2014-03-21T19:20:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, and worst case they can just manually configure the jshint website based on our jshintrc file
2014-03-21T19:20:56 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2014-03-21T19:21:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay thanks.. i\'m going to make those changes
2014-03-21T19:21:20 <colinclark> go for it
2014-03-21T19:21:23 <colinclark> it all seems great
