2014-12-13T19:49:49 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ouch I\'ve been "zapped by evil KASPARNET laser," LOL!
2014-12-13T19:50:46 <kasparnet> haha, hey slim_jim
2014-12-13T19:51:04 <kasparnet> how are things (besides burns from evil lasers)
2014-12-13T19:51:05 <slim_jim> hey - hows the hacking?
2014-12-13T19:51:09 <kasparnet> pretty good
2014-12-13T19:51:28 <kasparnet> Javi and I are hacking away
2014-12-13T19:51:29 <slim_jim> Wife is wathcing Strictly come dancing so I\'m catching up ;)
2014-12-13T19:51:33 <kasparnet> but are both pretty tired
2014-12-13T19:51:46 <kasparnet> haha, that makes sense
2014-12-13T19:51:47 <slim_jim> I bet. Must be beero\'clock?
2014-12-13T19:52:00 <kasparnet> oh - it already was two hours ago
2014-12-13T19:52:02 <kasparnet> :)
2014-12-13T19:52:06 <slim_jim> hehe
2014-12-13T19:52:21 <kasparnet> though so far we\'re keeping it pretty civilized
2014-12-13T19:52:46 <slim_jim> that\'s letting the side down!
2014-12-13T19:53:23 <kasparnet> yeah, I know .. we\'re working on it
2014-12-13T19:53:37 <kasparnet> we\'ll promise not to disappoint
2014-12-13T19:53:38 <slim_jim> good oh
2014-12-13T19:53:55 <kasparnet> btw - what\'s the the "tiger group" or whatever cool name it has?
2014-12-13T19:54:06 <kasparnet> the one that is meeting just before the arch. meeting?
2014-12-13T19:54:46 <kasparnet> (it\'s probably called something different - all I remember is that it had a totally cool name)
2014-12-13T19:54:49 <slim_jim> Greggs idea - its myself, Wayne (Trace) and Alfredo working on gettting solutions integrated
2014-12-13T19:54:56 <slim_jim> sort of technology on-boarding.
2014-12-13T19:55:21 <slim_jim> No idea where \'Tiger\' comes form but I like it
2014-12-13T19:55:47 <kasparnet> cool
2014-12-13T19:56:02 <slim_jim> so we work on a few key solutions needed for LGS and try to get other peeps involved with their solutions
2014-12-13T19:56:30 <slim_jim> it seem to make sense to segue into the Arch meeting
2014-12-13T19:56:46 <kasparnet> "Weekly Tigers meeting"
2014-12-13T19:57:04 <kasparnet> it sounds so much cooler than "architecture" or "integration" meeting
2014-12-13T19:57:12 <kasparnet> ... though a bit mac-centric
2014-12-13T19:57:14 <kasparnet> :D
2014-12-13T19:57:24 <kasparnet> slim_jim: that\'s a great idea
2014-12-13T19:57:40 <slim_jim> ah but Mac has moved on to Parks now!
2014-12-13T19:57:58 <slim_jim> yes pkus I am no working PT for RtF which is also cool
2014-12-13T19:59:27 <slim_jim> kasparnet: oh btw can you ask javie where the Android meeting notes are and where it is held? I\'ve been updating the meetings wiki page
2014-12-13T19:59:41 <kasparnet> sure
2014-12-13T19:59:51 <kasparnet> jhernandez:  where the Android meeting notes are and where it is held?
2014-12-13T19:59:53 <kasparnet> :D
2014-12-13T20:00:02 <slim_jim> bah!
2014-12-13T20:00:15 <jhernandez> we have no notes
2014-12-13T20:00:17 <jhernandez> xD
2014-12-13T20:00:27 <kasparnet> lol
2014-12-13T20:00:33 <slim_jim> jhernandez: that coz you never decide anyhting? :-P
2014-12-13T20:01:41 <jhernandez> no, that could be used against us in the future
2014-12-13T20:01:43 <jhernandez> :P
2014-12-13T20:01:55 <slim_jim> Fnarr fnarr
2014-12-13T20:02:32 <slim_jim> jhernandez: do you have in GtM room 1? It\'s marked as as public meeting so I\'m filing in details in the wiki page
2014-12-13T20:06:21 <jhernandez> slim_jim: if you have the permissions, you can just delete that form the calendar
2014-12-13T20:06:38 <kasparnet> slim_jim: filled in the security fixme
2014-12-13T20:06:41 <jhernandez> I mean, before it made sense, but not right now
2014-12-13T20:06:49 <kasparnet> dont have any details on the others
2014-12-13T20:06:53 <slim_jim> hhmmm - I might :)
2014-12-13T20:06:57 <jhernandez> it\'s long to explain
2014-12-13T20:07:49 <slim_jim> jhernandez: deleted all from an including next week :)
2014-12-13T20:08:12 <slim_jim> kasparnet: thanks
2014-12-13T20:08:21 <kasparnet> np
2014-12-13T20:13:27 <kasparnet> slim_jim: ok - we\'re heading out for some food
