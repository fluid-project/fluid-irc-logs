2014-03-03T18:47:39 <AyushDatta> hey Greggy.. I want to start working on the bug no. 0005437 - "words containing aprostrophe required \'/\' in glossary". Currently the bug is not resolved. Can you guide how to start working on it.

You can see the implementation at  http://54.201.190.217:8000/ . It would be great if you could open the link and advice me how to add this feature in Atutor.I don\'t know what exactly is expected.

2014-03-03T22:05:13 <simonjb> Bosmon2: I digging around in fluid.activityTrace and so far I\'m seeing 2 types of objects: 1) time, type, message, and args 2) a single property "pop" with a value of 1 or 2
2014-03-03T22:05:34 <simonjb> Bosmon2: what are the pop objects?

2014-03-03T22:30:28 <Bosmon2> Hi simonjb
2014-03-03T22:30:40 <Bosmon2> These are those things that represent "the end of an activity"
2014-03-03T22:31:00 * anastasiac has quit
2014-03-03T22:31:09 <Bosmon2> So for example when construction of a component starts, all the activities that follow (with the current architecture) are "nested in that activity"
2014-03-03T22:31:27 <Bosmon2> Once we get back to the same stack frame we then issue a "pop" to indicate that the activity has finished
2014-03-03T22:31:42 <Bosmon2> This will change somewhat once we have the "wave of explosions" .....
2014-03-03T22:32:45 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-03-03T22:42:07 <simonjb> Bosmon2: thanks for the info
2014-03-03T22:43:36 <simonjb> Bosmon2: how do I know when a nesting starts? is that implicit by the activity type? is there a corresponding "push" event?
2014-03-03T22:45:17 * michelled joined the channel
2014-03-03T22:51:05 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2014-03-03T22:51:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, it would be implicit by the activity type
2014-03-03T22:51:41 <Bosmon> simonjb - actually I believe that every activity currently represents one "push"
2014-03-03T22:52:05 <Bosmon> You should see a matching push/pop within every function body which produces a record - if there isn\'t, it is a fault
2014-03-03T22:53:06 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, so if 2 activities are at the same level, I would expect to see: activity1, pop=1, activity2?
2014-03-03T22:54:24 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2014-03-03T22:55:53 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-03-03T22:55:54 <Bosmon> simonjb - of course this is all "subject to review" since you are really nearly the first consumer of this information : P
2014-03-03T22:56:34 <simonjb> Bosmon: understood :) is there any asynchrony to the activities? if so, how does that relate to nesting?
2014-03-03T22:57:44 <Bosmon> simonjb - currently there is no real asynchrony in the framework, which is what FLUID-4982 is all about
2014-03-03T22:57:53 * colinclark has quit
2014-03-03T22:57:56 <Bosmon> With the current implementation, everything is coupled to the framework\'s own stack frames
2014-03-03T22:58:37 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, I\'ll try rendering the activity stream with nesting and see how it looks
2014-03-03T22:59:02 <Bosmon> simonjb - fantastic :)
2014-03-03T22:59:25 <Bosmon> Currently all that "push" and "pop" represent are "here is an interesting stack frame belonging to the framework"
