2014-11-28T15:26:47 <jhernandez> clown: hey!
2014-11-28T15:27:11 <clown> jhernandez:  hey!
2014-11-28T15:28:26 <jhernandez> wrt your problem with the RFID reader
2014-11-28T15:29:13 <clown> yes?
2014-11-28T15:29:32 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-11-28T15:29:33 <jhernandez> there\'s a well-known problem with ACS ACR122\xc3\x9c
2014-11-28T15:29:59 * clown is not one of the informed of the "well-known" problem.
2014-11-28T15:30:07 * clown ;-)
2014-11-28T15:30:24 <jhernandez> haha
2014-11-28T15:30:29 <jhernandez> it is!
2014-11-28T15:30:50 <jhernandez> but only in the instructions for the pilots
2014-11-28T15:32:29 <clown> can you remind me of the URL for that?
2014-11-28T15:32:38 <jhernandez> https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:javihernandez:GPII:Cloud4all:Pilots2014/nfc-acr122-support
2014-11-28T15:34:24 <jhernandez> this package blacklists both the pn533 and nfc modules
2014-11-28T15:34:59 <jhernandez> either install it or make the changes by hand
2014-11-28T15:35:48 <clown> Okay, I\'ll try that.  I can\'t actually do that until later today.
2014-11-28T15:35:54 <clown> :-(
2014-11-28T15:35:57 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-11-28T15:35:58 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-11-28T15:36:26 * danaayotte has quit
2014-11-28T15:36:32 <jhernandez> in case you want to do it manually
2014-11-28T15:37:03 <jhernandez> as root, create a file in /etc/modprode.d/99-klownRocks.conf
2014-11-28T15:37:30 <jhernandez> the content should be as simple as
2014-11-28T15:37:34 <jhernandez> blacklist pn533
2014-11-28T15:37:35 <jhernandez> blacklist nfc
2014-11-28T15:37:39 <jhernandez> that\'s all
2014-11-28T15:37:53 <jhernandez> reboot and cross your fingers
2014-11-28T15:38:00 <clown> "99-klownRocks"?  Seriously?
2014-11-28T15:38:04 <jhernandez> heh
2014-11-28T15:38:30 <jhernandez> the filename is up to you
2014-11-28T15:39:02 <jhernandez> :P
2014-11-28T15:39:13 <clown> I see that corresponds to the "99-acr122.conf" in the package.  What about the "nfc-acr122-support.spec"?
2014-11-28T15:39:30 <clown> Oh, that\'s a different hardware.
2014-11-28T15:39:32 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-28T15:39:43 <jhernandez> .spec is the rpm\'s spec
2014-11-28T15:39:50 <clown> got it.  I\'ll try to fit it in around lunch time.
2014-11-28T15:39:57 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-11-28T15:40:34 <jhernandez> if you can\'t, no prob
2014-11-28T15:41:11 <clown> just got email that kasparnet pulled some of my change.  woohoo!
2014-11-28T15:41:19 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-28T15:41:40 <jhernandez> that\'s the reason the rfid thing can wait
2014-11-28T15:41:42 <jhernandez> :)
2014-11-28T15:42:14 * anastasiac_ joined the channel
2014-11-28T15:42:28 <clown> no, the reason I have to put of the rfid testing is I\'m obligated to edit some w3c aria documents and submit them back to the w3c by end of today.

2014-11-28T17:09:25 <slim_jim> yeehah for the merge!
2014-11-28T17:11:47 <slim_jim> kaspers instructions seem a bit odd as you delete unversal/node_modules and run npm install twice.
2014-11-28T17:13:44 <slim_jim> "    The entire diff for the fireball branch (not counting the changes to kettle, infusion and jqUnit) can be seen here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/b278659b9a7ff9530a05690ca4e48b9778db6c71"
2014-11-28T17:13:57 <slim_jim> I\'ll keep that for bedtime reading then ! :)
2014-11-28T17:18:00 <slim_jim> awwww - "Sorry, we could not display the entire diff because too many files (349) changed. "

2014-11-28T21:48:08 <clown> Next, I\'m reviewing kasper\'s email about the merging of the fireball branch.
2014-11-28T21:48:26 <clown> But, I doubt I\'ll do anything substantial there until Mon.
