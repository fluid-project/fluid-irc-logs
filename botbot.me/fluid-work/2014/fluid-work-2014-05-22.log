2014-05-22T17:14:03 <michelled> Justin_o: does it look like what we are sending to NVDA is incorrect?
2014-05-22T17:21:11 <Justin_o> michelled: that's what I'm assuming, but i'm not sure exactly
2014-05-22T17:42:45 <Justin_o> simonjb: i merged https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/7

2014-05-22T12:42:12 <simonjb> hi jhung
2014-05-22T13:05:01 <jhung> hi simonjb
2014-05-22T13:10:03 <simonjb> jhung: would you have a little time to talk about static site generators?
2014-05-22T13:10:28 <jhung> sure in a few minutes
2014-05-22T13:11:01 <simonjb> jhung: awesome, ping me when you are ready
2014-05-22T13:12:50 <jhung> ok simonjb
2014-05-22T13:13:50 <simonjb> I was trying out github pages yesterday for infusion-docs and it doesn\'t help us out as much as I was hoping
2014-05-22T13:14:41 <simonjb> it can run jekyll for us and generate HTML from markdown
2014-05-22T13:14:45 <simonjb> which is nice, but we
2014-05-22T13:15:02 <simonjb> would still need to do styling ourselves
2014-05-22T13:16:04 <simonjb> I was hoping that we might get the github styling for free (what you see when you view markdown pages using the github repro browser)
2014-05-22T13:16:08 <simonjb> but we don\'t
2014-05-22T13:16:50 <simonjb> so, I was thinking that I would just have a go at setting up a static site generator for the docs and run it locally
2014-05-22T13:17:10 <simonjb> I was thinking of docpad + foundation
2014-05-22T13:17:41 <simonjb> jhung: I think you did some exploration and was wondering what you thought of docpad as a solution?
2014-05-22T13:19:13 <jhung> Yes simonjb. I have used Docpad with Bootstrap, but it\'s just as easy to use Foundation with it. In my experience I was doing my own styling and I wasn\'t using github pages, so I don\'t know what that integration is like.
2014-05-22T13:19:49 <jhung> simonjb from my experience I rather liked Docpad because of its plugin support and rather logical way of constructing and generating pages from templates.
2014-05-22T13:19:50 <simonjb> I\'m not too worried about integration with github pages -- this would be instead of
2014-05-22T13:20:00 * jessm joined the channel
2014-05-22T13:20:45 * yzen joined the channel
2014-05-22T13:21:18 <simonjb> (would could still use github pages as simply a host, with no integration as such other than uploading files)
2014-05-22T13:21:56 <simonjb> jhung: did you have any other suggestions for generators? or was docpad the front runner?
2014-05-22T13:23:34 <jhung> simonjb: I have only experience in Docpad. I briefly looked into Octopress and Wintersmith. Docpad won me because it had better plugin support and features out of the box. Also the developer of Docpad is extremely responsive.
2014-05-22T13:23:56 <simonjb> jhung: cool, I think I
2014-05-22T13:24:07 <simonjb> will give docpad + foundation a go
2014-05-22T13:24:34 <simonjb> thanks jhung
2014-05-22T13:24:37 <jhung> simonjb: great! Let me know how it goes. I can give pointers where possible.
2014-05-22T13:25:02 <simonjb> jhung: we did settle on foundation, right?
2014-05-22T13:25:08 <jhung> yes simonjb
2014-05-22T13:25:12 <simonjb> awesome
2014-05-22T13:27:18 <jhung> simonjb: when I was looking into docpad back in December, the documentation was adequate. The getting started guide was helpful but at the time it was slightly out of sync with the current release. Maybe they\'ve updated it since then.
2014-05-22T13:48:41 * Justin_o joined the channel
2014-05-22T13:48:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: sorry i forgot to log in today
2014-05-22T13:49:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: no worries, in fact I see you\'re going through pilot2 bugs - we can leave my question for later
2014-05-22T13:50:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: that\'s okay.. i think i\'m done that for the time being..
2014-05-22T13:51:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: so to answer your question.. as you have discovered arrays naturally overwrite and don\'t merge, so you will definitely need to use the merge policy
2014-05-22T13:51:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m not sure what your question is regarding using it though
2014-05-22T13:52:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: I simply want when the two grades are merged, the two arrays for groups > visAlternatives > panel to be merged as well
2014-05-22T13:52:56 <amilchev> Justin_o: but I don\'t know where should I apply the merge policy
2014-05-22T13:53:10 * jash4 has quit
2014-05-22T13:54:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: i suppose you can have a base grade that they both use which has the merge policy. Is one of these being merged onto the other, or are they combined in another grade somewhere else?
2014-05-22T13:56:17 <Justin_o> if it\'s the latter, then perhaps this grade should contain the merge policy for such things.
2014-05-22T13:56:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: the two of them are combined here https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-543/src/shared/adjusters/js/starter.js#L20
2014-05-22T13:58:07 <amilchev> Justin_o: you can think of "compulsory.concat(components) as to ["gpii.pcp.auxiliarySchema.visualAlternativesGroup", "gpii.pcp.auxiliarySchema.speakText", "gpii.pcp.auxiliarySchema.screenReaderBrailleOutput"]
2014-05-22T13:59:20 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeha, thought that this will be the case, but how do I set the policy in the build function
2014-05-22T13:59:36 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. by the way, you might be able to use an expander there instead.. if that will simplify the code... so you might be able to just add your mergePolicy grade to this spot too.. i guess as one of the compulsory ones.
2014-05-22T14:00:19 <Justin_o> i think you should be able to drop it in as a grade, otherwise you might just be able to specify it in the same block
2014-05-22T14:00:20 <amilchev> Justin_o: ha, didn\'t think of that, cool
2014-05-22T14:00:53 <amilchev> Justin_o: I\'ll have a try and ping you again to let you know

2014-05-22T14:46:56 <simonjb> Justin_o: I have just made a pull request for the infusion-docs README.md landing page https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/7 -- if you had time to review and commit, that would be awesome
2014-05-22T14:47:31 <Justin_o> simonjb: sure i\'ll take a look at that.. i\'m in a PMT/PCP meeting right now, but I should have some time afterwards
2014-05-22T14:47:45 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o

2014-05-22T15:27:15 <clown_mtg> jhernandez:  this bugzilla (I finally found it) might be applicable to your issue:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=746205
2014-05-22T15:27:20 * clown_mtg is now known as clown
2014-05-22T15:29:59 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, thanks
2014-05-22T15:30:19 <jhernandez> did you see my last email to the arch list?
2014-05-22T15:30:36 <clown> not yet.
2014-05-22T15:30:37 * clown looks
2014-05-22T15:31:58 <clown> Okay, I have now.  FF does allow users to specify their own style sheets.  That might mitigate this.
2014-05-22T15:32:11 <clown> And, I "might" be a quicker way to a solution.
2014-05-22T15:32:38 <clown> I can look into it, if you want, jhernandez.
2014-05-22T15:33:59 <jhernandez> well, I wasn\'t suggesting to provide a solution, was just clarifying the issue that pilot sites were facing
2014-05-22T15:34:29 <jhernandez> in any case, it\'s worth to investigate not only the high contrast but the font size too
2014-05-22T15:34:49 <clown> that would also be covered by a user style sheet.
2014-05-22T15:35:21 <jhernandez> IIRC, I tried disabling the css and by enlarging the font size in the system didn\'t affect the web content
2014-05-22T15:35:30 <jhernandez> ah
2014-05-22T15:35:37 <jhernandez> ok
2014-05-22T15:35:53 <clown> An issue I ran into back in 2012 is that even when a user style sheet is used, the minute you change or refresh the page, it is lost, and you have to re-assert it.
2014-05-22T15:37:02 <clown> actually, the FF preferences has dialogs for setting colours and fonts, and they "stick".
2014-05-22T15:37:21 <clown> you\'d just need to find out where those preferences are stored.
2014-05-22T15:38:05 <clown> It\'s under FF\'s "Content" preferences.
2014-05-22T15:38:35 <clown> There are buttons for "Advanced\xe2\x80\xa6" font styles and "Colors\xe2\x80\xa6".
2014-05-22T15:38:36 <jhernandez> yeah, I accessed to them programmatically through about:settings
2014-05-22T15:38:55 <clown> right.
2014-05-22T15:38:55 <jhernandez> in an experimental firefox add-on
2014-05-22T15:39:51 <clown> FF used to place these settings in a file, something like "settings.js", which it load on launch.  I wonder if it still does that.
2014-05-22T15:40:02 <clown> *loads
2014-05-22T15:40:08 <jhernandez> I can change them through my add-on
2014-05-22T15:40:14 <clown> Or is that waht your add-on does?
2014-05-22T15:40:21 <clown> Ah, okay.
2014-05-22T15:40:29 <jhernandez> letme zip it and pass it to you by mail
2014-05-22T15:40:59 <jhernandez> anyway, I have to leave now, but I\'d love to keep talking with you about this
2014-05-22T15:41:08 <jhernandez> :)
2014-05-22T15:41:14 <jhernandez> maybe later
2014-05-22T15:41:32 <clown> I guess what you need to do then, is when high contrast/font changes are asserted to fire your add-on, but without shutting down FF.
2014-05-22T15:41:34 <clown> hmm....
2014-05-22T15:41:38 <clown> okay later.
2014-05-22T15:43:05 <jhernandez> cool
2014-05-22T15:43:10 <jhernandez> zip sent
2014-05-22T15:43:15 <jhernandez> and thanks!
