2014-06-24T18:51:03 <jhernandez> clown_mtg: wrt "is there anything you want me to look at, specifically?" - perhaps, re-think about the updatePackage-related tests
2014-06-24T18:51:54 <jhernandez> wrt "and, what was the rationale for the change?" - yeah, we have had a few discussions here in Crete about it
2014-06-24T18:52:37 <jhernandez> in any case, the pull request is about to be merged
2014-06-24T18:52:58 <jhernandez> we will keep working on it once I\'m back in Brussels

2014-06-24T20:07:15 <clown> jhernandez, catching up by looking at the log.
2014-06-24T20:08:05 <clown> jhernandez:  I will pull these changes into my local branch and study them closer.  I\'ll probably bring the tests into alignment with the new plugin interface.
2014-06-24T20:08:50 <clown> and, I thought of a rationale for the change:  it\'s a way of adding/removing packagekit functions without having the change the javascript API.
2014-06-24T20:08:57 <clown> is that the reason.
2014-06-24T20:09:00 <clown> ?

2014-06-24T12:49:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking over the UIO API page right now. I\'m not sure we should have the "Modifiable Preference Defaults" section.
2014-06-24T12:50:04 <cindyli> Justin_o: shouldn\'t we let users know how to reset the defaults? or there\'s a better way to do it?
2014-06-24T12:50:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: wouldn\'t we suggest that they use a fluid.prefs.create function instead of UIO if they wanted to do this?
2014-06-24T12:50:42 <cindyli> ah,  see what you mean
2014-06-24T12:51:11 <cindyli> i don\'t know which way is more proper
2014-06-24T12:51:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: i don\'t think we want them to call fluid.defaults again if it has already been called in the infusion js file they have..
2014-06-24T12:51:45 <cindyli> ok. if to hide fluid.defaults. i will change the doc

2014-06-24T12:58:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: it looks like the API page is missing the onPrefsEditorReady event
2014-06-24T12:59:06 <Justin_o> we also don\'t mention the typical events, like onCreate and etc. but that might be okay
2014-06-24T13:00:21 * amilchev joined the channel
2014-06-24T13:01:18 <cindyli> Justin_o: yes, i will include onPrefsEditorReady, was thinking it\'s better to use onReady which includes onPrefsEditorReady and is more reliable
2014-06-24T13:01:55 <cindyli> but since onPrefsEditorReady is in there and can be listened to, will add it in
2014-06-24T13:16:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, maybe add a note that they should use onReady..
2014-06-24T13:16:24 <Justin_o> or maybe we should deprecate it.. is it needed for anything, what\'s its purpose?
2014-06-24T13:21:23 <cindyli> Justin_o: it\'s needed by onReady === onPrefsEditorReady + onCreate
2014-06-24T13:21:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: ah so onReady is just an aggregate of those two
2014-06-24T13:21:48 <cindyli> exactly
2014-06-24T13:22:00 <Justin_o> maybe it\'s not needed then.. i don\'t know :(
2014-06-24T13:24:03 <cindyli> haha. Justin_o, by looking at that component, i don\'t see a case that integrators would prefer onPrefsEditorReady than onReady.
2014-06-24T13:24:10 <cindyli> but since it\'s there ...
2014-06-24T13:24:50 <cindyli> maybe as you suggested, add it in with a notes

2014-06-24T18:08:22 <mpolizzotti1> Hello everyone. Would this be the right room to field a question about the fluid pager?
2014-06-24T18:17:15 <mpolizzotti1> We have recently upgraded from fluid 1.4 to 1.5. We have an implementation of the fluid pager that leverages the onModelChange event. When the onModelChange event fires some work is performed on the pager\'s underlying list items. After upgrading we noticed that the list item DOM references became stale within the context of the onModelChange handler. I cannot be absolutely clear that upgrading caused this issue but I wanted to ask
2014-06-24T18:26:33 <jhernandez> clown: heeeey!
2014-06-24T18:26:48 <clown> jhernandez; hi!
2014-06-24T18:29:07 <jhernandez> clown: JFYI, I did many changes on https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49
2014-06-24T18:29:23 * clown looks
2014-06-24T18:30:05 * clown wonders how I missed antranig\'s comments.
2014-06-24T18:31:50 <clown> okay, I\'ve read the JIRA (GPII-851), but I haven\'t read the changes in detail.
2014-06-24T18:32:04 <clown> jhernandez, is there anything you want me to look at, specifically?
2014-06-24T18:32:15 <clown> or look into?
2014-06-24T18:33:14 <jhernandez> well, some of them happened during these days in Crete
2014-06-24T18:33:16 <jhernandez> I think that the most relevant is https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/commit/ae854f1f37e2590b3525f8e2660203d0185bf39e
2014-06-24T18:33:30 * clown looks
2014-06-24T18:36:00 <clown> it doesn\'t look like you updated the test file (nodepackagekit_test.js).
2014-06-24T18:36:09 <clown> Or, maybe I\'m not seeing the whole picture.
2014-06-24T18:36:54 <clown> and, what was the rationale for the change?
2014-06-24T18:37:00 <clown> (if I may ask)...
