2014-12-23T13:50:39 <Justin_o> how are things?
2014-12-23T13:52:10 <simonjb> Justin_o: good, did you see my note last night about logout?
2014-12-23T13:53:33 <simonjb> (on fluid-work)

2014-12-23T14:29:44 <Justin_o> uh no
2014-12-23T14:29:53 <Justin_o> simonjb: i didn\'t see that
2014-12-23T14:29:56 <Justin_o> let me look again
2014-12-23T14:30:13 * yzen joined the channel
2014-12-23T14:30:28 <Justin_o> simonjb: are you sure it went to fluid-work.. i don\'t see anything there
2014-12-23T14:30:44 <simonjb> Justin_o: np, I implemented the server /logout action: https://github.com/simonbates/universal/commits/GPII-1036
2014-12-23T14:31:04 <simonjb> Justin_o: but I\'m thinking that we should remove logout from the authorize page
2014-12-23T14:31:16 <simonjb> Justin_o: and leave it on the privacy page
2014-12-23T14:31:43 <simonjb> Justin_o: I think getting the flow right from the authorize page is too tricky for now and it\'s better just to remove it
2014-12-23T14:31:51 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay. is that because we want them to be redirected back  to the oauth2 client
2014-12-23T14:32:24 <Justin_o> simonjb: by the way, is this temporary?
2014-12-23T14:32:47 <simonjb> Justin_o: ideally it would be client -> authorize -> logout -> login -> authorize -> client
2014-12-23T14:33:19 <simonjb> Justin_o: which requires remembering what we were authorizing after we logout and returning to that flow
2014-12-23T14:33:43 <simonjb> which I think I want to give more thought to before implementing
2014-12-23T14:33:52 <simonjb> yes, removing should be temporary
2014-12-23T14:34:14 <simonjb> I just don\'t want to hack something in and introduce a cross site vulnerability
2014-12-23T14:35:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: makes sense.. i\'ll just remove it from the markup for now or comment it out or something
2014-12-23T14:36:29 <simonjb> Justin_o: awesome, let me know when you\'re done and I will merge the logout work into GPII-17 -- thanks!
2014-12-23T14:36:47 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks, it shouldn\'t be too long.. i\'ll let you know
2014-12-23T14:37:13 <Justin_o> simonjb: did you make your changes for logout in your GPII-1036 branch?
2014-12-23T14:37:25 <simonjb> Justin_o: yes
2014-12-23T14:37:34 <Justin_o> did you want me to merge those into my branch too?
2014-12-23T14:38:17 <simonjb> Justin_o: up to you -- my GPII-1036 includes your change
2014-12-23T14:38:21 <simonjb> s
2014-12-23T14:38:26 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay
2014-12-23T14:40:15 * jessm joined the channel
2014-12-23T14:40:22 <simonjb> cindyli, Justin_o: this morning I made the changes to make the oauth2ClientId available to the Privacy page: https://github.com/simonbates/universal/commits/GPII-17 (GPII-1061)
2014-12-23T14:40:37 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2014-12-23T14:41:41 <cindyli> great. thanks, simonjb
2014-12-23T14:43:50 <Justin_o> simonjb: all done
2014-12-23T14:45:40 <simonjb> Justin_o: for the removal of the logout from the authorize page, would you mind removing the markup, rather than commenting out? in case we end up changing the implementation so that we don\'t have unexercised stale code -- thanks!
2014-12-23T14:50:52 <Justin_o> simonjb: yep, i removed it
2014-12-23T14:50:53 <simonjb> sorry Justin_o, I missed your "all done" message -- you are done with the removal of logout from authorize? good for me now to check and merge in?
2014-12-23T14:51:05 <Justin_o> simonjb: yes
2014-12-23T14:51:13 <Justin_o> it\'s should be all ready for you to look at
2014-12-23T14:51:22 <simonjb> Justin_o: great, thanks
2014-12-23T14:55:08 <simonjb> Justin_o: could you change GPII-1036 so that we leave the user name, but just remove the logout?
2014-12-23T14:55:20 <Justin_o> oh sure, i can do that
2014-12-23T14:55:28 <simonjb> thanks very much
2014-12-23T14:59:29 <Justin_o> simonjb: the username is back in
2014-12-23T15:32:07 <simonjb> Justin_o: all looks good -- I\'ve merged GPII-1036 into GPII-17
2014-12-23T15:32:32 <Justin_o> simonjb: great thanks
2014-12-23T15:36:07 <simonjb> Justin_o: in terms of recording the fact that logout isn\'t implemented on authorize, do you want a new jira and close 1036 or leave 1036 open and add a comment?
2014-12-23T15:36:30 <Justin_o> simonjb: when do you think we\'ll be putting it back?
2014-12-23T15:36:49 <Justin_o> before or after the server work is merged into master?
2014-12-23T15:37:35 <simonjb> Justin_o: that I don\'t know, it depends on our merge schedule
2014-12-23T15:37:58 <simonjb> but this one will need a bit of thought to get it right
2014-12-23T15:38:47 <simonjb> it\'s maybe possible that we won\'t implement it (maybe)
2014-12-23T15:40:27 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay.. lets leave 1036 open for now, and after we merge it, if it hasn\'t been put back we should open a new one
2014-12-23T15:40:29 <Justin_o> does that sound okay?
2014-12-23T15:40:59 <simonjb> Justin_o: yep, that sounds reasonable to me -- want me to add the comment?
2014-12-23T15:42:21 <simonjb> to explain why logout wasn\'t done on authorize yet
2014-12-23T16:01:11 <Justin_o> simonjb: sure thanks
2014-12-23T16:06:48 <simonjb> hi Bosmon and Bosmon8, how\'s it going with the integration and testing? anything that I can help with?
