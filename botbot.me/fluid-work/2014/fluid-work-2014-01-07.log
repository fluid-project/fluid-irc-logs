b'2014-01-07T22:01:02 <kasparnet> failing under windows
2014-01-07T22:01:17 <kasparnet> (not the high-contrast 64bit thing)
2014-01-07T22:01:48 <kasparnet> Bosmon8: yzen is currently working on fixing it, I believe
2014-01-07T22:02:36 <yzen> Bosmon8: the same issue that i though moduleSource can help, it seems like with latest changes environment is still attempted to be resovled
2014-01-07T22:03:23 * clown has left the channel
2014-01-07T22:04:00 <yzen> Bosmon8: regarding that user , it\'s an example of how match maker preference should look like in the preference set
2014-01-07T22:09:31 <Bosmon8> yzen - it still resolves the environment "at an inappropriate time"?
2014-01-07T22:09:39 <yzen> yes
2014-01-07T22:09:41 <Bosmon8> Ok
2014-01-07T22:09:49 <Bosmon8> Can you link me to the relevant line of configuration?
2014-01-07T22:10:03 <yzen> of the test case ?
2014-01-07T22:10:07 <Bosmon8> yes
2014-01-07T22:10:25 <yzen> this for example https://github.com/yzen/windows/blob/GPII-75/tests/AcceptanceTests.js#L459
2014-01-07T22:11:03 <Bosmon8> Ah
2014-01-07T22:11:35 <Bosmon8> Well, isn\'t that strange?
2014-01-07T22:11:49 <Bosmon8> Surely by definition that is the one piece of configuratoin that could never be resolved "early"
2014-01-07T22:11:56 <Bosmon8> Since it is interpreted directly by the settings handler
2014-01-07T22:12:06 <Bosmon8> Well, or rather, the flow manager
2014-01-07T22:12:17 <yzen> Bosmon8: well this is passed as component options (for the test case holder)
2014-01-07T22:12:35 <yzen> so naturally it gets resolved right ?
2014-01-07T22:12:55 <Bosmon8> Well, if it were, it could only be resolved in a completely corrupted way
2014-01-07T22:13:05 <Bosmon8> But I guess what you told me didn\'t rule that out
2014-01-07T22:13:09 <Bosmon8> You did say it was resolved "early" : P
2014-01-07T22:13:14 <yzen> yes
2014-01-07T22:13:20 <Bosmon8> Without saying that it was resolved in an entirely incorrect way : P
2014-01-07T22:13:46 <yzen> well surely if you pass json as component options and it has ioc references the framework will try to resolve it no ?
2014-01-07T22:13:54 <Bosmon8> In theory the IoC system could indeed try to brokenly interpret "{environment}.APPDATA" as a context name
2014-01-07T22:14:04 <yzen> yes
2014-01-07T22:14:12 <Bosmon8> Although I guess the standard parsing rules would actually terminate the context at the first }
2014-01-07T22:14:31 <Bosmon8> So it would actually consider that the context is "{environment"
2014-01-07T22:14:55 <Bosmon8> And that the EL path is "APPDATA}\\\
vda\\\
vda.ini"
2014-01-07T22:15:40 <yzen> 15:11:49.141:   ASSERTION FAILED:  Failed to resolve reference {environment}.APP
2014-01-07T22:15:40 <yzen> DATA - could not match context with name environment from component { typeName:
2014-01-07T22:15:41 <yzen> "kettle.tests.testCaseHolder"
2014-01-07T22:15:53 <Bosmon8> ok
2014-01-07T22:16:07 <Bosmon8> If you\'d shown me the actual error message, we might have saved some time :)
2014-01-07T22:16:22 <Bosmon8> So it looks like you just need an additional mergePolicy inside the acceptance testing framework
2014-01-07T22:16:33 <Bosmon8> In theory we didn\'t need "moduleSource" at all
2014-01-07T22:17:19 <yzen> yes i thought so , i also though i can try using fluid.noexpand
2014-01-07T22:17:22 <yzen> but it did not work
2014-01-07T22:17:42 <Bosmon8> Well, fluid.noexpand may well be entirely broken, on the evidence we\'ve had recently
2014-01-07T22:17:49 <yzen> so the acceptance framework does not create components , it just expands the testDefs block to include extra steps in the sequence
2014-01-07T22:18:06 <yzen> Bosmon8: are you suggesting i need to make one :) ?
2014-01-07T22:18:10 <Bosmon8> Well, I think not, it seems "noexpand" has some test cases
2014-01-07T22:18:15 <Bosmon8> So it probably still works
2014-01-07T22:18:18 <Bosmon8> Well ok
2014-01-07T22:18:29 <Bosmon8> Let\'s explore this idea that "the acceptance framework does not create components" : P
2014-01-07T22:20:01 <yzen> ok sure, so it means i can\'t contribute a mergePolicy right ?
2014-01-07T22:20:10 <Bosmon8> Well
2014-01-07T22:20:22 <Bosmon8> Surely the only issue could be the opposite - that it in fact DOES create some kind of component
2014-01-07T22:20:55 * anvk has quit
2014-01-07T22:20:55 <Bosmon8> Otherwise what would this EL reference be a reference to:     var testDefRef = "{tests}.options.testDef";
2014-01-07T22:21:50 <yzen> hmm that
2014-01-07T22:22:08 <Bosmon8> Can you link me to the copy of universal you are currently working with?
2014-01-07T22:23:04 <yzen> Bosmon8: my copy of universal is broken , since i can\'t point to an infusion commit since 5185 is out of sync with master
2014-01-07T22:23:12 <Bosmon8> ok
2014-01-07T22:23:16 <Bosmon8> But just to read the code
2014-01-07T22:23:20 <yzen> Bosmon8: its universal as is with kettle 5185 branch
2014-01-07T22:23:31 <Bosmon8> I see
2014-01-07T22:23:46 <yzen> Bosmon8: kettle test utils https://github.com/yzen/kettle/blob/FLUID-5185/test/utils/js/KettleTestUtils.js
2014-01-07T22:24:01 <Bosmon8> Surely there were changes to univeral\'s AcceptanceTests.js?
2014-01-07T22:24:13 <Bosmon8> The one I just quoted from
2014-01-07T22:24:31 <yzen> not sure which version your testDefRef is from
2014-01-07T22:24:35 <yzen> it is not in the latest master
2014-01-07T22:24:38 <Bosmon8> ok
2014-01-07T22:24:40 <Bosmon8> Let me check
2014-01-07T22:25:59 <Bosmon8> yzen.... so the quoted line is not present
2014-01-07T22:26:02 <Bosmon8> But a very similar one is
2014-01-07T22:26:03 <Bosmon8> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/AcceptanceTests.js#L182
2014-01-07T22:26:10 <Bosmon8> Which suggests potential for the problem we are seeing
2014-01-07T22:26:40 <Bosmon8> Clearly the block "settingsHandlers" is part of the options of SOME component
2014-01-07T22:26:55 <yzen> Bosmon8: yes the test case holder
2014-01-07T22:27:11 <yzen> that\'s what I mentioned earlier
2014-01-07T22:27:12 <Bosmon8> Unfortunately there are so many things in the world called "tests" it is hard to see what it is
2014-01-07T22:27:33 <yzen> tests - https://github.com/yzen/kettle/blob/FLUID-5185/test/utils/js/KettleTestUtils.js#L349
2014-01-07T22:27:40 <Bosmon8> Sorry, thanks :)
2014-01-07T22:27:41 <Bosmon8> With you now
2014-01-07T22:27:59 <Bosmon8> Ah fascinating
2014-01-07T22:28:08 <Bosmon8> And the builder function is hardwired into Kettle : P
2014-01-07T22:28:11 <Bosmon8> As it its grade : P
2014-01-07T22:29:17 <Bosmon8> So it seems that all that is required to is to extend "kettle.tests.buildTestCase" to be able to interpret more material from a "testDef"
2014-01-07T22:29:25 <Bosmon8> That is, to allow it to accept some gradeNames as well
2014-01-07T22:29:30 <Bosmon8> How lucky we are we still have you around : P
2014-01-07T22:30:06 <yzen> ok ill try to fix it tonight or tomorrow morning :)
2014-01-07T22:30:45 <Bosmon8> Then all we need to do is define a "gpii.tests.AcceptanceTestCaseHolder" grade with the appropriate mergePolicy
2014-01-07T22:30:54 <yzen> ok ill try that :)

2014-01-07T23:02:22 <colinclark> Bosmon8: another quick and simplistic question for you
2014-01-07T23:02:26 <colinclark> if you can spare a sec
2014-01-07T23:02:43 <colinclark> or Bosmon
2014-01-07T23:02:46 <colinclark> either one of you
2014-01-07T23:02:50 <Bosmon8> Hi colinclark - it is me
2014-01-07T23:03:53 <colinclark> I have a component that fires an event
2014-01-07T23:04:24 <colinclark> and it passes along a "raw" object
2014-01-07T23:04:29 <colinclark> which another component listens for
2014-01-07T23:04:36 <colinclark> "parses" the raw object
2014-01-07T23:04:50 <colinclark> and fires a subsequent "higher level" event
2014-01-07T23:13:04 <colinclark> sorry
2014-01-07T23:13:13 <colinclark> someone waked into my office
2014-01-07T23:13:24 <colinclark> anyway, I wonder if there\'s any kind of simple way to handle this
2014-01-07T23:13:43 <colinclark> It\'s a kind of boiling scenario
2014-01-07T23:14:01 <colinclark> but in this particular case a Node.js Buffer needs to get JSONified in between
2014-01-07T23:16:38 <Bosmon8> You could write an expander in the args list of a boiled event
2014-01-07T23:16:49 <Bosmon8> It\'s a little unsightly but not unheard-of

2014-01-07T23:46:17 <colinclark> hi sorry, i\'m back
2014-01-07T23:47:12 <michelled> Bosmon8: the error we are getting is http://pastie.org/8612209
2014-01-07T23:47:24 <michelled> does it seem like the same issue that yzen was seeing in tests?
2014-01-07T23:47:47 <colinclark> It\'s comparable to the issue I was seeing also when debugging on Ubuntu over the holidays
2014-01-07T23:47:54 <colinclark> but I checked for stray copies of Infusion and it appears to be all there
2014-01-07T23:48:21 <colinclark> michelled: I think I might, as a next step, try cloning a fresh copy of the windows repository
2014-01-07T23:48:22 <colinclark> and running the build scripts, etc.
2014-01-07T23:48:55 <colinclark> Bosmon8: So if I put an expander in the args list of the event, it will be expanded automatically every time the event fires? That\'s great
2014-01-07T23:48:59 <michelled> sure
2014-01-07T23:49:18 <colinclark> I guess I\'ll still have the issue of the expander eating my Buffer?
2014-01-07T23:49:22 <colinclark> in its voracious way
2014-01-07T23:53:58 <Bosmon8> colinclark - hopefully the issue only bites in the other direction
2014-01-07T23:54:05 <colinclark> chomp
2014-01-07T23:54:09 <Bosmon8> That is, an expander which returns a Buffer, rather than one which consumes one
2014-01-07T23:54:16 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-07T23:54:20 <colinclark> ok, that will help tidy up this code a lot
2014-01-07T23:54:45 <colinclark> sadly it won\'t reduce the latency of the sound it produces
2014-01-07T23:54:52 <colinclark> but that\'ll come
2014-01-07T23:54:56 <colinclark> michelled
2014-01-07T23:55:00 <colinclark> \'s issue is very strange
2014-01-07T23:55:13 <colinclark> I mean, it looks like the same issue I wrestled with over the holiday
2014-01-07T23:55:17 <Bosmon8> michelled - that issue looks like it is caused by a mismatched version of Infusion being visible to Kettle
2014-01-07T23:55:20 <Bosmon8> Yes
2014-01-07T23:55:26 <Bosmon8> And it will have a very similar kind of cause
2014-01-07T23:55:46 <colinclark> At the point of the error,  kettle.gradeLinkageRecord.userLoginHandlerSession does indeed have the "autoInit" grade
2014-01-07T23:55:51 <colinclark> so i can\'t think of what else it could be
2014-01-07T23:55:57 <colinclark> but I can\'t find any extra Infusions anywhere
2014-01-07T23:56:24 <Bosmon8> colinclark - as we discovered, the error never really refers to the absence of "autoInit" itself
2014-01-07T23:56:30 <Bosmon8> But actually to an "incomplete grade hierarchy"
2014-01-07T23:56:44 <Bosmon8> In this case what will be missing is "fluid.gradeLinkageRecord"
2014-01-07T23:56:54 <Bosmon8> You should try grepping throughout the tree for this to see what you find
2014-01-07T23:57:10 <Bosmon8> It may be that what has happened is that the version of Infusion is simply incorrect, rather than duplicated
2014-01-07T23:57:21 <Bosmon8> Since this depends on a framework feature which was only added a month or so ago
2014-01-07T23:57:31 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2014-01-07T23:58:02 <Bosmon8> Perhaps some kind of bad merge or checkout or npm install has somehow trashed the infusion revision
2014-01-07T23:58:30 <Bosmon8> But firstly search for as many versions of FluidIoC.js as you can find
2014-01-07T23:58:46 <Bosmon8> And then check that each one (hopefully just 1!) has fluid.defaults("fluid.gradeLinkageRecord") in it

2014-01-07T19:48:41 <Bosmon8> I am looking down the list starting at the most urgent ones.... but still find myself a bit puzzled
2014-01-07T19:48:53 <Bosmon8> For example this one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/180/files
2014-01-07T19:48:58 <Bosmon8> Appears as if it might be harmless
2014-01-07T19:49:10 <Bosmon8> But I wonder how I could possibly know if it is safe to be merged : P
2014-01-07T19:49:17 <Bosmon8> yzen, colinclark may also have some input on this issue
2014-01-07T19:49:33 * jhung1 has quit
2014-01-07T19:49:53 <Bosmon8> This pull request has to me the unfortunate combination of properties of apparently being "very very urgent" whilst at the same time "sort of unfathomable" .......

2014-01-07T20:43:49 <kasparnet> Bosmon8: I might have miscategorized some of them - I thought that one was a requirement for matchmaker integration (ST and RB matchmakers)
2014-01-07T20:52:11 <michelled> kasparnet: will the demo be on Monday or on Wednesday?
2014-01-07T20:52:23 <kasparnet> michelled: wednesday
2014-01-07T20:52:53 <kasparnet> monday will be spent going through the demo, presentations, etc
2014-01-07T20:52:57 <colinclark> kasparnet: I was just thinking about Matchmaker integration, based on Andy\'s response
2014-01-07T20:53:04 <colinclark> I feel like there are some pieces missing
2014-01-07T20:53:19 <colinclark> based on the comment where he says "Its tested to work in the architecture master as it was on xmas if you integrate it manually (replacing the .match function)"
2014-01-07T20:53:27 <colinclark> that doesn\'t quite sound like an integration to me
2014-01-07T20:53:45 <colinclark> but maybe there\'s something about the nature of an integration that I am unaware
2014-01-07T20:53:46 <colinclark> of
2014-01-07T20:53:56 <colinclark> yzen: How does it look from your perspective?
2014-01-07T20:54:27 <colinclark> is the issue that we need the Matchmaker Proxy to be reviewed and pushed?
2014-01-07T20:57:02 <kasparnet> colinclark: I *think* (and yura/michelle - correct me if I\'m wrong) we ended up deciding that the ST MM would be run as a separate server - and the solution for now is that andy will be running his own instance of a specially modified universal - where the matchmaker part is replaced
2014-01-07T20:57:25 <kasparnet> colinclark: (he would then only run the \'matchmaker\' part of the framework as a service)
2014-01-07T20:57:38 <colinclark> oh, ok
2014-01-07T20:57:40 <yzen> kasparnet: colinclark: so as far as i know Nick has a working version of the rule based match maker that works as a standalone
2014-01-07T20:57:58 <yzen> there were only a couple of changes to the older repo that he had related to updating to the latest universal
2014-01-07T20:58:04 <kasparnet> colinclark: though this might just be me making stuff up cause I dont want new crazy and scary things to come up :)
2014-01-07T20:58:33 <yzen> colinclark: kasparnet it should be working with the server without any issues, it\'s just the matter of pointing the proxy to the right standalone match makers
2014-01-07T20:59:14 <colinclark> How is that done, yzen?
2014-01-07T20:59:29 <yzen> statistical one, afaik, is almost the same and unless customization of match is done differently from the rule based matchmaker example, there might be something wrong
2014-01-07T21:00:03 <yzen> well we have a top level configuration in universal along with the one we usually use that configures the proxy instead of the actual match maker
2014-01-07T21:00:04 <colinclark> This is Andy\'s repository, yzen: https://github.com/AndreasStiegler/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker1
2014-01-07T21:00:59 <colinclark> So it sounds like we first need to get the Matchmaker Proxy into master
2014-01-07T21:01:10 <colinclark> and then something needs to be done to create configuration files for each Matchmaker?
2014-01-07T21:01:12 <michelled> yzen: what does the configuration look like? can you point me to the working one?
2014-01-07T21:01:33 <yzen> https://github.com/yzen/universal/blob/GPII-270/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/configs/proxy.json
2014-01-07T21:01:58 <yzen> this is the one used by the top level config: https://github.com/yzen/universal/blob/GPII-270/gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.multipleMatchMakers.json
2014-01-07T21:02:31 <colinclark> So what does Andy need to do to support the Proxy API?
2014-01-07T21:02:35 <colinclark> or is he already good?
2014-01-07T21:03:09 <colinclark> Looks like he\'s using older-style "demands" configuration, and needs to update his module to run as a server?
2014-01-07T21:03:13 <colinclark> is that right?
2014-01-07T21:03:32 <yzen> colinclark: he does not have to do anything except for making sure that his match maker server runs as a standalone server, which is similar to the previous pilot iteration
2014-01-07T21:03:57 <yzen> colinclark: yes that was the only change nick and i had to do to make sure his repo supports latest universal
2014-01-07T21:04:06 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-07T21:04:15 <colinclark> So I\'ll compare Nick\'s module to Andy\'s
2014-01-07T21:04:18 <yzen> colinclark: and even then the only reason we needed to update to the latest was because of solutions data being updated slightly
2014-01-07T21:04:29 <colinclark> and that should tell me specifically what Andy needs to do?
2014-01-07T21:04:48 <yzen> colinclark: ya instead of demands we are are now leverage grades and grade linkage ability
2014-01-07T21:04:52 <colinclark> kasparnet and michelled: Who\'s on deck to review the Matchmaker Proxy? And do they know they are? And do they have a timeline for it?
2014-01-07T21:05:10 <yzen> https://github.com/NickKaklanis/RuleBased_MatchMaker/blob/master/lib/RuleBasedMatchMaker.js#L34-L53
2014-01-07T21:06:48 <yzen> and this https://github.com/NickKaklanis/RuleBased_MatchMaker/blob/master/lib/RuleBasedMatchMaker.js#L67-L71
2014-01-07T21:06:54 <kasparnet> colinclark: Bosmon8 will be reviewing the matchmaker proxy stuff - and yeah - I think he\'s well aware of it (or well - I sent out the pull-request mail a few hours ago, so he\'s very-recently-well-aware of it)
2014-01-07T21:07:13 <colinclark> thanks, yzen, for the links
2014-01-07T21:07:15 <colinclark> very helpful
2014-01-07T21:07:34 <kasparnet> colinclark: no timeline, but it\'s on the "very very very pressing" shortlist
2014-01-07T21:08:02 <yzen> colinclark: there was an issue with older version and now the framework forced to correct something (access to the request)
2014-01-07T21:10:11 <Bosmon8> yzen, colinclark - sorry to be away at dinner
2014-01-07T21:10:24 <Bosmon8> yzen\'s original question is a good one, "what would make me feel better about it"
2014-01-07T21:10:34 <Bosmon8> Clearly #1 at the list would be... "some tests"
2014-01-07T21:10:45 <Bosmon8> But there may be some good reasons why these are not sensible to produce
2014-01-07T21:11:02 <Bosmon8> For example, the CORS functionality itself is, I believe, at least somewhat tested at the kettle level
2014-01-07T21:11:13 <yzen> Bosmon8: well we have core tests, if you want to test core in universal it is really testing kettle no?
2014-01-07T21:11:19 <Bosmon8> So it would seem redundant to test it again, especially if the content of the patch is simply "to enable the use of CORS"
2014-01-07T21:11:42 <Bosmon8> All the same, the reviewer needs some kind of assurance about the pull request : P
2014-01-07T21:12:57 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-07T21:13:35 <Bosmon8> kasparnet - I am "aware" of the proxy stuff, yes
2014-01-07T21:13:38 <Bosmon8> But the issue is somewhat the same
2014-01-07T21:13:44 <Bosmon8> The code "looks sensible" to me
2014-01-07T21:13:49 <Bosmon8> And this pull request has at least SOME tests
2014-01-07T21:14:24 <Bosmon8> But our test cases being what they are for the GPII still, I\'m still not completely clear on how I can actually run them
2014-01-07T21:15:48 <Bosmon8> It seems that despite our best efforts we really are at the same situation that we were at the pilots previously - that is, we have lots of functionality on hand that we "have belief that it works" but have no reliable way of actually verifying this
2014-01-07T21:15:59 <Bosmon8> That is, some test cases which "anyone" can run
2014-01-07T21:16:05 <Bosmon8> kasparnet - do you think that is right?
2014-01-07T21:17:12 <kasparnet> Bosmon8: well - yes and no - that depends on how you define "anyone".. We do have a pretty decent unit test coverage that anyone should be able to run (provided they have windows when testing windows stuff, linux when testing linux stuff, etc)
2014-01-07T21:18:00 <kasparnet> Bosmon8: and we do have acceptance tests, which (with the prerequisite of having NVDA installed in windows) should work provided the tester has the relevant platform available
2014-01-07T21:18:36 <kasparnet> Bosmon8: I guess the "relevant platform available" is what\'s prevents \'anyone\' to run it ... we still need that damn VM to distribute

2014-01-07T21:26:25 <michelled> yzen: perhaps, if it\'s not possible to write tests for the pull request, you could provide Bosmon8 with a description of how to prove that it\'s working
2014-01-07T21:26:36 <michelled> maybe you could screen share and show him?
2014-01-07T21:27:31 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-01-07T21:28:16 <michelled> Bosmon8: we have never managed to \'make back the ground\' we lost when we cut our last hack branches for pilots and hackathons. we have been slowly moving towards that, but we aren\'t there yet
2014-01-07T21:28:56 <michelled> I feel confident that we will indeed get to the point where we have a lovely set of easily run tests and all the functionality that we regularly depend on and demo in the master repository
2014-01-07T21:29:18 <michelled> but that unfortunately isn\'t going to be possible before the review.
2014-01-07T21:29:30 <colinclark> uh oh
2014-01-07T21:30:19 <michelled> I\'m not suggesting that we put anything in to master that we aren\'t happy with. so if things really can\'t go in - so be it. if there is a way we can be happy with it, let\'s strive for that.
2014-01-07T21:33:27 <colinclark> I think the thing we need right now, Bosmon / Bosmon8 is specificity
2014-01-07T21:33:39 <colinclark> I see seventeen pending pull requests to Universal
2014-01-07T21:34:18 <colinclark> So if there are ones we have concerns about, we need a very specific to do list of what needs to be addressed about them
2014-01-07T21:39:28 <Bosmon8> Ok
2014-01-07T21:39:50 <Bosmon8> Well, interestingly from my point of view, the issue doesn\'t seem to be that much about "specificity"
2014-01-07T21:40:05 <Bosmon8> But just that I still don\'t know how I can basically test the architecture in a way that is credible
2014-01-07T21:40:09 * clown joined the channel
2014-01-07T21:41:19 <Bosmon8> So of those "very very urgent" and "very urgent" pull requests on my plate, I see lots of things that "seem reasonable" and that I wouldn\'t have a strong reason to object to based on the code that is in them
2014-01-07T21:43:14 <Bosmon8> But I just have no way of telling whether they will screw the system up completely
2014-01-07T21:44:54 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose people have been relying on manual testing. is that what you do kasparnet, yzen, colinclark, sgithens?
2014-01-07T21:45:50 <kasparnet> michelled: yeah, I generally run unit tests (browser and non-browser), then acceptance and finally logging in/out a few people
2014-01-07T21:46:07 <Bosmon8> The trouble is, I\'m on the move with an underpowered Windows laptop with no VMs on it
2014-01-07T21:46:19 <Bosmon8> So my capability to test things is very limited
2014-01-07T21:46:51 <Bosmon8> And I won\'t be back home and at work fully until Thursday, which seems cutting it a bit fine for things which are "very very urgent"
2014-01-07T21:47:26 <michelled> ah, perhaps I can help there - why don\'t you tell me when pull requests you are actually happy with from reading the code perspective and I\'ll try to test them out as best as I can
2014-01-07T21:47:44 <Bosmon8> Ok, well I am "in theory" happy with both of my "very very" urgent ones
2014-01-07T21:48:02 <Bosmon8> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/180/files seems completely innocuous
2014-01-07T21:48:19 <Bosmon8> Although it still seems a strange feature of Kettle\'s design that one actually needs to do this :)
2014-01-07T21:48:45 <Bosmon8> The kettle.use.* system and its mysterious motivations is something we will need to shoulder after yura\'s departure
2014-01-07T21:49:39 <colinclark> Which is why yzen and anastasiac have a plan to thoroughly document Kettle prior to his departure
2014-01-07T21:49:40 <michelled> is this the second one? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/174
2014-01-07T21:49:46 <Bosmon8> Yes
2014-01-07T21:49:57 <Bosmon8> I just entered a small query on that, but otherwise I am happy with it too
2014-01-07T21:50:46 <michelled> kasparnet: so, do you generally run the tests etc on windows and linux or also android?
2014-01-07T21:52:05 <yzen> Bosmon8: well as far as the GPII-270 goes you the tests cover success and failure scenarios, and you can run then on any platform
2014-01-07T21:52:13 <yzen> just like with the rest of the universal tests
2014-01-07T21:53:09 <Bosmon8> yzen - it seems unclear that I can really run them "on any platform"
2014-01-07T21:53:26 <Bosmon8> For example there\'s some material in this test, for example, which refers to Windows high contrast settings
2014-01-07T21:53:42 <Bosmon8> Which from my experience, with our current testing infrastructure, can only be run on a suitable Windows system
2014-01-07T21:53:45 <Bosmon8> Isn\'t this the case?
2014-01-07T21:54:15 <colinclark> I just commented on both pull requests so that it\'s clear where we\'re at in terms of the status of these two pull requests
2014-01-07T21:54:19 <yzen> Bosmon8: it only tests the proxy to the match maker not the whole architecture
2014-01-07T21:55:23 <Bosmon8> yzen - ok - perhaps we should adopt a special annotation at the head of a test case which explains its portability profile
2014-01-07T21:55:39 <kasparnet> michelled: well, most of the changes I review are specific to a platform (even if they may reside in universal) so I generally just test on that platform
2014-01-07T21:56:33 <michelled> kasparnet: and what do you do about the currently failing windows tests?
2014-01-07T21:57:31 <Bosmon8> So you\'re saying that I could run "ProxyTests.js" on any platform, even though its material appears to have Windows-specific tests?
2014-01-07T21:57:48 <Bosmon8> Actually I see now that the input_TestCase12_new.json seems unrelated
2014-01-07T21:59:11 <yzen> Bosmon8: yes it should not matter, all the tests in universal should run on any platform
2014-01-07T21:59:39 <yzen> if there are test cases  that use prefs that are platform specific, they are not testing the actual application of those prefs
2014-01-07T21:59:53 <Bosmon8> yzen - ok, I issued a few pull request queries for that one
2014-01-07T22:00:19 <kasparnet> michelled: well - haven\'t reviewed anything after the failing windows tests - but will have to do so tomorrow -- not quite sure what to do about it though
2014-01-07T22:00:35 <Bosmon8> kasparnet - which are our failures now?
2014-01-07T22:00:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon8: apparently there is an issue with the acceptance tests

2014-01-07T15:19:24 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o_
2014-01-07T15:19:27 <Bosmon7> I am here a little
2014-01-07T15:29:51 * clown joined the channel
2014-01-07T15:37:09 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: hello, sorry i missed this
2014-01-07T15:37:33 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: i\'m wondering if you have ideas around model sharing (e.g. model relays) and dynamic components
2014-01-07T15:37:58 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-01-07T15:38:42 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - perhaps you can be more specific :)
2014-01-07T15:40:24 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-01-07T15:45:41 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: so we have something that\'s i guess like your repeating input field from CSpace.. basically a user can enter in some captions info, and a new set of inputs will appear.. but these all need to be fed back to a parent model to manage
2014-01-07T15:46:50 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: you can look at the designs for milestone 1 here http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/FLOE+Metadata+Authoring+Design
2014-01-07T15:47:51 <Justin_o_> we may just end up going with the two static fields but eventually we were planning on having the dynamically increasing set.. and we were thinking of using dynamic components to help with this.. but it\'s the model management that is tripping us up at the moment.
2014-01-07T15:50:32 <jhung1> Justin_o_, cindyli - I was going to remove the closed tasks in the Floe Iteration Plan page. Is that okay?
2014-01-07T15:50:53 <Justin_o_> jhung1: yes please.. we might want to close out FLOE-111 too
2014-01-07T15:53:20 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - yes, it seems reasonable
2014-01-07T15:53:30 <Bosmon7> I can\'t remember enough of the details of "old modelRelay" to see why this might problematic
2014-01-07T15:56:23 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: hmm.. okay.. will the new model relay system handle this okay.. and does it also come with model transformations.. the problem we are having is around the fact that the model in the parent will be an array and trying to associate those values with a particular dynamic component.. perhaps we need model transformations here.
2014-01-07T15:57:32 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - I see what you mean
2014-01-07T15:57:41 <Bosmon7> This is a facility that actually isn\'t implemented for "new modelRelay" either
2014-01-07T15:57:56 <Bosmon7> So it may be to your advantage that you currently only have the old, simpler impl to work with : P
2014-01-07T15:57:56 <Justin_o_> :(
2014-01-07T15:58:04 * jessm joined the channel
2014-01-07T15:58:06 <Justin_o_> i guess that\'s good :)
2014-01-07T15:58:25 <Justin_o_> any ideas of how we might tackle this issue?
2014-01-07T16:02:09 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - you\'ll just have to synthesize the required configuration yourself, probably based on a variant base grade of your existing modelRelay
2014-01-07T16:02:09 <Bosmon7> Note that both the variables {source} and {sourcePath} are available in dynamicComponent configuration material
2014-01-07T16:02:09 <Bosmon7> And so given the latter, you should be able to produce suitable modelRelay configuration
2014-01-07T16:03:49 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-07T16:04:47 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: what does {sourcePath} give you?
2014-01-07T16:05:59 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - it gives you the path of the particular piece of source material used to instantiate the dynamic component
2014-01-07T16:06:22 <Bosmon7> So in particular, if you had instantiated it from {that}.model.arrayThing it would give you the path into the model\'s array
2014-01-07T16:07:37 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7:  oh okay... so that might work.. we can explore that..
2014-01-07T16:09:55 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: when do you think we\'ll have model transformations built in with the model relay?
2014-01-07T16:10:03 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - it just needs review :)
2014-01-07T16:10:48 <Justin_o_> oh cool.. so soon.. by the way, did you see michelled\'s comments on your FLUID-5185 pull request?
2014-01-07T16:10:54 <Bosmon7> But don\'t expect the work of integrating it to be very quick
2014-01-07T16:10:54 <Bosmon7> We will "have" it
2014-01-07T16:10:54 <Bosmon7> But it will exist integrated initially only in the context of the Pager
2014-01-07T16:10:56 <Bosmon7> THis will just start off a long process of converting and vetting our components one by one
2014-01-07T16:11:13 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-01-07T16:11:55 <colinclark> I actually started reviewing it yesterday, so it will be in soon, I expect
2014-01-07T16:11:59 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - yes, I have been working on answering those
2014-01-07T16:12:09 <Bosmon7> colinclark - awesome :)
2014-01-07T16:12:17 <Justin_o_> okay, that makes sense.. perhaps we could help trying it out in the metadata demo.. we may have a need for some model transformations there
2014-01-07T16:12:53 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - yes, certainly for any new developments, we should start out by using the new component grades
2014-01-07T16:13:06 <Bosmon7> Once we have 100% conversion, we can ditch all of the old code
2014-01-07T16:13:14 <Bosmon7> But I don\'t plan for this before the 1.5 release
2014-01-07T16:13:18 <Bosmon7> 1.5 will be a "fat release"
2014-01-07T16:14:39 <Justin_o_> Bosmon7: that\'s all reasonable.. i guess 2.0 will be the lean version of infusion
2014-01-07T16:14:51 <Bosmon7> Justin_o_ - right
2014-01-07T16:15:46 <colinclark> Bosmon7: I have a quick, lame question for you
2014-01-07T16:15:53 <Bosmon7> Hi colinclark
2014-01-07T16:16:00 <Bosmon7> I\'m absolutely convinced it will be a great question
2014-01-07T16:16:05 <colinclark> I have a model listener that looks roughly like this:
2014-01-07T16:17:07 <colinclark> modelListeners: { "pots.*": ... }
2014-01-07T16:17:07 <colinclark> when I log "{change}.path", it\'s actually an array
2014-01-07T16:17:07 <colinclark> ["pots", "0"]
2014-01-07T16:17:14 <Bosmon7> Oh yes
2014-01-07T16:17:19 <colinclark> I was surprised by that
2014-01-07T16:17:35 <Bosmon7> Yes, the framework has moved over to segment arrays pretty much universally
2014-01-07T16:17:43 <Bosmon7> As an attempt to economise on "parsing garbage"
2014-01-07T16:18:13 <colinclark> My model looks like this:
2014-01-07T16:18:23 <Bosmon7> The "old framework" spent an inordinate amount of time packing things into string ELs and then parsing them out again
2014-01-07T16:18:27 <colinclark> right
2014-01-07T16:18:31 <colinclark> paths: [0, 27, 0, 192]
2014-01-07T16:18:41 <colinclark> I\'d like to listen for changes in the "leaves"
2014-01-07T16:18:56 <colinclark> sorry, that should be pots: [0, 27, 0, 192]
2014-01-07T16:18:59 <Bosmon7> yup
2014-01-07T16:19:15 <colinclark> so if one item in the array changes, I want to hear about it with that specific value
2014-01-07T16:19:32 <colinclark> So should I just use a utility somewhere to reconstitute a path?
2014-01-07T16:19:40 <colinclark> from the array?
2014-01-07T16:19:44 <Bosmon7> Well - why would you want to reconstitute it?
2014-01-07T16:19:51 <Bosmon7> Surely it already contains exactly what you need to know
2014-01-07T16:20:27 <Bosmon7> And in fact it would be quickest to use it in the form given, rather than any other
2014-01-07T16:20:53 <colinclark> interesting
2014-01-07T16:21:14 <Bosmon7> You, like the framework, would only then go to parse out the damn thing again once you had reconstituted the path....
2014-01-07T16:21:51 <Bosmon7> Yes.... it took me a while to come round to this point of view
2014-01-07T16:22:00 <colinclark> Ok, I guess that makes some sense
2014-01-07T16:22:20 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2014-01-07T16:22:25 <colinclark> and again speaks to the role of Model Relay in terms of actually covering most of the cases of what you\'d want to DO with the path anyway

2014-01-07T16:51:20 <colinclark> Bosmon7: I just added this little section to the "IoC References" wiki page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/IoC+References#IoCReferences-ReservedIoCNames
2014-01-07T16:51:52 <Bosmon7> colinclark - that\'s very helpful, thanks
2014-01-07T16:52:01 <Justin_o_> colinclark: hello
2014-01-07T16:52:14 <colinclark> Did you name something "source," too?
2014-01-07T16:52:21 <Bosmon7> I mentioned privately in chat that we might well be able to remove this restriction
2014-01-07T16:54:18 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i had run into an issue where naming anything with source at the beginning didn\'t work.. e.g. sourceAnything.. but i\'m pretty sure Bosmon7 fixed that now
2014-01-07T16:54:48 <Justin_o_> that list of reserved words is pretty useful
2014-01-07T16:55:44 <colinclark> I\'m just filing an issue about my experience, in case it\'s helpful to others
2014-01-07T16:55:46 <Bosmon7> It\'s fixed but may well still be in the review queue
2014-01-07T16:55:51 <colinclark> and then Bosmon7 can use that as the basis for a more specific issue about removal of the restriction
