2014-04-08T13:55:54 <Justin_o> amilchev1: i downloaded the bat file for windows and used it to start up the gpii servers.. however the login issue still seems to be there
2014-04-08T14:00:37 <Justin_o> amilchev1: i think i\'ll have to try to redo the install it\'s complaining about missing files now.
2014-04-08T14:01:57 <jhernandez> amilchev1: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-698
2014-04-08T14:08:42 <amilchev1> Justin_o: I actually have never tried that bat file. Just set NODE_ENV=pilot2 and start.cmd won\'t work rither, will it?
2014-04-08T14:09:43 <amilchev1> jhernandez thanks
2014-04-08T14:09:59 <jhernandez> amilchev1: yw
2014-04-08T14:10:59 <jhernandez> just wondering if we can just add a "maxValue" option in the same way we set other stuff such as the step value

2014-04-08T14:15:35 <amilchev1> Justin_o: weird...... I guess starting from scratch is the best option

2014-04-08T16:35:04 <Bosmon> I don\'t see anything fresh there for a while
2014-04-08T16:35:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry FLUID-5298

2014-04-08T16:36:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - Yes, I think we were talking about that yesterday
2014-04-08T16:36:26 <Bosmon> Just pushing a fix now
2014-04-08T16:36:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-04-08T16:45:37 <Bosmon> ok Justin_o - branch is updated yet again
2014-04-08T16:45:42 <Bosmon> Let me know if you run into any more of these :)
2014-04-08T16:45:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, will do

2014-04-08T17:12:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m not sure I remember that there were any that were specifically expected to be bad
2014-04-08T17:12:10 <Bosmon> Although I know we have at least 1 JIRA open
2014-04-08T17:12:12 <Bosmon> Which failures are you seeing?

2014-04-08T20:03:16 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - thanks for your further report
2014-04-08T20:03:37 <cindyli> no problem, Bosmon, hope it makes sense
2014-04-08T20:03:38 <Bosmon> Do you think you could revert to issuing pull requests against the main infusion repo, since they are easier to see there?
2014-04-08T20:03:48 <cindyli> sure
2014-04-08T20:03:51 <Bosmon> I know it is a bit of a mess in our list at the moment, but at least it is all in one place :)
2014-04-08T20:06:24 <cindyli> one sec, Bosmon, wouldn\'t it be easier to see the diff if the pull request is against your branch, since my pull request is based off ur 5293 branch?
2014-04-08T20:07:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - well I don\'t really look at the diffs too much anyway, my main task is discovering which of your branches the pull is actually in : P
2014-04-08T20:08:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: it\'s in cindyli:FLUID-5293. you can see it at the top description of this page - https://github.com/amb26/infusion/pull/6/
2014-04-08T20:09:16 <Bosmon> Ok, thanks
2014-04-08T20:09:33 <cindyli> i certainly can issue the pull request against infusion master if that makes it easier for you, Bosmon
2014-04-08T20:09:33 <Bosmon> I never really believe those things since the github interface behaves so strangely when there are pull requests against moving targets
2014-04-08T20:09:41 <Bosmon> That\'s ok, I can see it now :)
2014-04-08T20:10:04 <cindyli> ok
