2014-04-23T20:32:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please take a look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/497
2014-04-23T20:32:51 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2014-04-23T20:33:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for getting the linting pull request in
2014-04-23T20:33:43 <cindyli> Justin_o: did you run jshint on the pull?
2014-04-23T20:33:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: is something wrong :(
2014-04-23T20:34:10 <cindyli> missing space, Justin_o
2014-04-23T20:34:22 <Justin_o> really.. it's coming up lint free for me :(
2014-04-23T20:34:24 <cindyli> enactor.js, line 300
2014-04-23T20:34:38 <cindyli> =function (root)
2014-04-23T20:34:57 <cindyli> perhaps that is valid for jshint?
2014-04-23T20:35:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: could be, but fixed it
2014-04-23T20:35:29 <cindyli> cool. thanks

2014-04-23T20:39:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for all your work on it!
2014-04-23T20:39:10 <Bosmon> Do we have a linting inconsistency?
2014-04-23T20:39:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - if you have run an earlier version of Justin_o's linting branch, you may need to update
2014-04-23T20:39:43 <Bosmon> That is, by deleting your node_modules
2014-04-23T20:39:55 <Bosmon> Since we momentarily had a version of jshint which ignored all whitespace
2014-04-23T20:40:12 <cindyli> ah ha. that's why, thanks, Bosmon
2014-04-23T20:42:29 <Bosmon> Oh, it is Justin_o who will need to do that
2014-04-23T20:42:37 <Bosmon> Since obviously he has been running an earlier version of his own branch : P

2014-04-23T13:25:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay, but it looks like the test is referencing infusion wrong. The file name has changed https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/tree/gpii-663/src/shared/lib/infusion
2014-04-23T13:26:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: oh, got it ..

2014-04-23T15:49:10 <clown> hi jhernandez
2014-04-23T15:49:10 <jhernandez> sorry I was away
2014-04-23T15:49:19 <clown> almost arch meeting time.
2014-04-23T15:49:23 * jhernandez nods
2014-04-23T15:49:44 <clown> just wanted to know if you saw my email from last week about first attempts at fixing the seg fault.
2014-04-23T15:49:54 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-04-23T15:50:00 <jhernandez> saw it, and tried it
2014-04-23T15:50:06 <clown> oh, really?
2014-04-23T15:50:10 <clown> did it help?
2014-04-23T15:50:17 <jhernandez> but didn\'t answer neither to the pr or the mail, sorry
2014-04-23T15:50:34 <jhernandez> well, it half-helps
2014-04-23T15:50:40 <clown> yeah, no problem.  But, that\'s why I asked (just now).
2014-04-23T15:51:27 <jhernandez> well, by not segfaulting it\'s nice so fa
2014-04-23T15:51:29 <jhernandez> *far
2014-04-23T15:51:57 <jhernandez> but, when it does not segfault we don\'t  get any results
2014-04-23T15:52:15 <clown> Well, I wasn\'t sure if it would stop the seg fault since I was guessing where it was coming from.
2014-04-23T15:52:17 <jhernandez> I have to understand the bug better
2014-04-23T15:52:42 <clown> So:  it\'s good to know that we know better where it\'s happening.
2014-04-23T15:52:59 <clown> That also implies that the bug is inside package kit.
2014-04-23T15:53:07 <clown> "oh joy".
2014-04-23T15:54:18 <jhernandez> yes!
2014-04-23T15:56:21 <clown> also, I don\'t see the seg fault often \xe2\x80\x94 just the once in fact.
2014-04-23T15:56:29 <jhernandez> we can try to create a test case that demostrates the segfault
2014-04-23T15:56:58 <clown> so, it\'s perhaps a bug with OpenSuse vs. Fed.  Or, perhaps yum vs. whatever OpenSuse uses.
2014-04-23T15:57:00 <jhernandez> well, since I can reproduce it easily, I\'ll try to create a test case
2014-04-23T15:57:20 <jhernandez> yes
2014-04-23T15:57:35 <jhernandez> but I\'m pretty sure that it\'s the same bug
2014-04-23T15:58:20 <jhernandez> and by using zypper as backend is more evident
2014-04-23T15:58:23 <clown> 3 minutes \xe2\x80\x94 I\'m going to set up for the meeting.  I\'ll "see" you there.  We can continue this discussion later (if you ave time).
2014-04-23T15:58:31 <jhernandez> yup
2014-04-23T15:58:32 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-23T15:58:34 <clown> yeah, yum vs, zypper
2014-04-23T15:58:34 <jhernandez> tty later
2014-04-23T15:58:38 <jhernandez> haha
2014-04-23T16:01:05 <clown> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6  connect to meeting is not connecting\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-04-23T16:01:21 <clown> kasparnet:  is there an arch meeting (now)?
2014-04-23T16:02:04 <kasparnet> clown: yes - I was just a bit slow at getting there
2014-04-23T16:02:19 <clown> kasparnet:  no problem.
2014-04-23T16:04:47 <kasparnet> colinclark: we\'re starting the arch. meeting now if you want to join
2014-04-23T16:27:46 * vjoanna has quit
2014-04-23T16:29:43 <clown> jhernandez:  FYI: I have another meeting (telecon) at the top of the hour, for about an hour.  Then I should be free for the rest of the day.
2014-04-23T16:30:05 <jhernandez> clown: ACK
2014-04-23T16:30:25 <jhernandez> anyway, I will probably leave in an hour or so
2014-04-23T16:30:33 <jhernandez> sorry
2014-04-23T16:31:07 <jhernandez> but I\'ll try to create a piece of code to dive better into our segfault issue
2014-04-23T16:31:10 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-23T16:31:13 <clown> no problem, jhernandez different time zones.
2014-04-23T16:31:30 <clown> cool, jhernandez.  If you get far enough, feel free to share it with me.
2014-04-23T16:31:35 <jhernandez> sure
