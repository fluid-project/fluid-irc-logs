2014-10-06T12:20:45 <amilchev> hey Justin_o
2014-10-06T12:21:05 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello
2014-10-06T12:21:13 <amilchev> I\'ve updated https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/71 with some tests
2014-10-06T12:21:36 <amilchev> they all pass in node-webkit, but throw a weird error on FF
2014-10-06T12:22:23 <amilchev> whenever you have the time, could have a quick look at them and see if 1) it\'s the same with you and 2) wtf is this
2014-10-06T12:24:47 <amilchev> it\'s related to jqUnit-browser.js\'s  isVisible and notVisible and the message is "pok @ ..."
2014-10-06T12:28:41 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-10-06T12:33:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: i think part of your message may have been stripped out
2014-10-06T12:33:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: i don\'t see what "this" is referring to
2014-10-06T12:35:13 <amilchev> Justin_o: do you mean here https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/71/files#diff-1fc4fac22d5e4661daf587ef6b6666b8R63
2014-10-06T12:36:38 <Justin_o> amilchev: i mean in your point "2)" that you made above
2014-10-06T12:37:40 <amilchev> ooh
2014-10-06T12:38:09 <amilchev> "this error - have you seen it, why does it appear in FF but not in node-webkit"..
2014-10-06T12:38:18 <amilchev> this is what I meant
2014-10-06T12:39:01 <Justin_o> oh :) okay.. i\'ll take a look.. i\'m going to try to get my fedora instance running again today. I didn\'t get a chance to look into it again after the call on thursday and i was off on friday.a
2014-10-06T12:39:24 <amilchev> Justin_o: whenever you have the time..thx

2014-10-06T14:36:40 <Justin_o> amilchev: I was looking at your unit tests for https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/71
2014-10-06T14:38:15 <Justin_o> amilchev: it seems that the problem is related to the selector you are passing in not being found. so the visibility tests are all failing
2014-10-06T14:39:12 <Justin_o> pok is the underlying qunit assertion that is being run. It looks like a boolean tests similar to assertTrue, so the failure is just that the result didn\'t evaluate to true.
2014-10-06T14:39:25 <Justin_o> amilchev: hope that helps
2014-10-06T14:40:07 <amilchev> Justin_o: why is this selector not found and how come node-webkit finds it?
2014-10-06T14:40:46 <Justin_o> amilchev: not sure about the later. For the former, I\'m assuming the test is run before the element is added to the DOM.
2014-10-06T14:41:40 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you put a break point in jqUnit-browser on the isVisible and isHidden tests you can inspect the DOM and see if the elements you want are actually present.
2014-10-06T14:42:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: thx
2014-10-06T14:43:56 <Justin_o> amilchev: let me know how it goes
2014-10-06T15:03:37 <amilchev> Justin_o: yes, indeed the pcp hasn\'t even begun to render
2014-10-06T15:04:12 <amilchev> at the time noVisible is called
2014-10-06T15:04:18 <amilchev> notVisible*
2014-10-06T15:05:43 <amilchev> Justin_o: how do I make sure the tests start only after this member is ready https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-752/tests/js/pcpStatusMessagesTests.js#L23-L39
2014-10-06T15:07:15 <amilchev> could it be whatever you suggested when we talked about adding extra grade with "onReady" listener to the prefsEditor section in the fluid.prefs.create func?
2014-10-06T15:08:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: something like that yes.. you need to wait for an event.. for the IoCTesting framework if you have to wait on an event that is triggered during/by the creation process you need to use the IoCSS syntax.. here is an example
2014-10-06T15:08:59 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/TestingTests.js#L118
2014-10-06T15:09:25 <Justin_o> that says bind to the onReady event of the initTest component that will be created later.
2014-10-06T15:10:04 <Justin_o> and you\'ll need to setup a createOnEvent like this one that has been commented out. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/TestingTests.js#L80-L83
2014-10-06T15:10:34 <Justin_o> of course you wouldn\'t comment this out in yours, it was just done for testing a specific issue.

2014-10-06T15:28:37 <amilchev> Justin_o: btw just wondering doesn\'t this achieve the same effect? https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/tests/js/textfieldStepperTests.js#L95-L97
2014-10-06T15:29:07 <amilchev> by using listenerMaker and makerArgs
2014-10-06T15:36:21 <Bosmon> amilchev - listenerMaker is unnecessary in recent versions of Infusion
2014-10-06T15:36:36 * cindyli has quit
2014-10-06T15:36:43 <Bosmon> You can just supply a regular listener + args
2014-10-06T15:41:38 <amilchev> Bosmon thx

2014-10-06T16:04:15 <Justin_o> amilchev: you can generally just listen to events, but you have to do something to trigger them first. In the case where this happens atomically through the creation process you have to use the IoCSS syntax and etc to have the sequence setup correctly.
