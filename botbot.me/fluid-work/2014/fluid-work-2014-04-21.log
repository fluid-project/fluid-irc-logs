b'2014-04-21T18:20:11 <danaayotte> jhung anastasiac i also updated the attached doc in FLOE-178 to include all changes
2014-04-21T18:20:18 <jhung> anastasiac: yes I was just reading that now. Took me a bit to figure out what it was referring to (so many things going on)
2014-04-21T18:20:21 <jhung> I
2014-04-21T18:20:27 <anastasiac> tell me about it :-)
2014-04-21T18:20:31 <jhung> I\'ll update that pull request now
2014-04-21T18:20:56 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, sounds like you have everything under control. Guess I can head home now ;-)

2014-04-21T18:22:08 <anastasiac> jhung, michelled, I\'m going to start looking through the wiki for demo links that need updating, unless there\'s something else that\'s more important that I\'ve forgotten
2014-04-21T18:22:33 <jhung> danaayotte: I\'m a bit confused. Where do you want this text to appear? "The FLOE metadata authoring components can be integrated into existing content editors to allow authors to create or edit metadata that accompanies the content of their Open Education Resource (OER). \xc2\xa0For the purposes of this demo, the metadata components are shown within a simple content editor."

2014-04-21T19:56:45 <jhung> I can do a pull req for that to get our ducks lined up, but that\'s the missing piece michelled
2014-04-21T19:57:01 <michelled> ok, avtar said he\'d update that now

2014-04-21T20:23:28 <michelled> we are on the home stretch :)
2014-04-21T20:24:08 <jhung> michelled: I was going to ask - what do we have left?
2014-04-21T20:24:49 <michelled> jhung: you must be at the end of your day, right?
2014-04-21T20:25:15 <jhung> michelled: I can stay a little longer if needed.
2014-04-21T20:25:42 <michelled> jhung: maybe just read through the draft email in the pirate pad and try things out
2014-04-21T20:25:47 <michelled> look for things we need to fix :)
2014-04-21T20:26:30 <jhung> michelled: got it. Is anyone looking at the "Update other links" issue?
2014-04-21T20:26:40 <michelled> anastasiac is
2014-04-21T20:26:53 <jhung> excellent. I\'ll go over the email now.
2014-04-21T20:32:10 <jhung> I\'m going through the FLOE project site now\xe2\x80\xa6 it\'s amazing how crtitical the overviewPanel has become. I really notice its absence on the few demos we have yet to integrate.
2014-04-21T20:33:15 <jhung> Not only does it give useful info and context, it gives all our demos much needed unity across projects. Even though all the demos look different, the familiarity of the overviewPanel is somewhat comforting.
2014-04-21T20:34:39 <anastasiac> jhung, michelled, the build site looks great. I just tested all the links
2014-04-21T20:35:17 <michelled> great!

2014-04-21T20:37:36 <anastasiac> colinclark, danaayotte, jessm: I\'ve tried to go through the wiki to find demo links that need updating and fixed what I found. Could you three bring some attention to bear to this task? Think about where on the wiki there might be links into the demos, build site, etc and double-check that they\'re good?
2014-04-21T20:38:15 * colinclark has quit
2014-04-21T20:39:16 <jessm> anastasiac: sure, i\xe2\x80\x99ll try
2014-04-21T20:42:02 <jhung> michelled: the email and the associated links good great. The only thing that needs to get addressed is the build site which still has old links. I assume avtar is looking at that.
2014-04-21T20:42:23 <michelled> is your page cached?
2014-04-21T20:45:32 <jhung> michelled: ah.
2014-04-21T20:45:43 <jhung> michelled: everything looks good
2014-04-21T20:46:46 <michelled> yay! I sent the email off to Jutta
2014-04-21T20:46:51 <michelled> this is looking awesome!
2014-04-21T20:47:29 <michelled> jhung, anastasiac, avtar, danaayotte: thanks for your hard work leading up to this!
2014-04-21T20:48:17 <danaayotte> thank YOU michelled!
2014-04-21T20:48:50 <anastasiac> so michelled, where do we stand? What still needs to be done?
2014-04-21T20:50:35 <michelled> anastasiac: did you manage to update known links to demos?
2014-04-21T20:51:06 <anastasiac> michelled, I did what I found. I\'ve pinged jessm, colinclark and danaayotte to see if they could have a look
2014-04-21T20:51:10 <michelled> cool
2014-04-21T20:51:43 <jessm> anastasiac: it looks like you can type the urls into the search
2014-04-21T20:51:51 <jessm> would that help in tracking down pages?
2014-04-21T20:51:58 <michelled> anastasiac, jhung: let\'s check our email in the morning to see if Jutta wants any updates made
2014-04-21T20:52:22 <anastasiac> jessm, I tried that and it didn\'t work for me
2014-04-21T20:52:25 * kasper joined the channel
2014-04-21T20:52:34 <danaayotte> anastasiac: doing my best to look around the wiki and see what I can find
2014-04-21T20:52:38 <michelled> anastasiac, jhung: otherwise, perhaps you two could pair on adding UIO and VP to to the floe site
2014-04-21T20:52:51 <anastasiac> michelled, I did start a bit on UIO
2014-04-21T20:52:53 <jessm> anastasiac: meaning? what happened when you searched for a url?
2014-04-21T20:53:03 <anastasiac> jessm, it didn\'t find it
2014-04-21T20:53:15 <anastasiac> even though I copied the url off a page
2014-04-21T20:53:28 <jessm> i just typed in \xe2\x80\x98build.fluidproject.org\'
2014-04-21T20:53:52 <anastasiac> ah, I had the http:// in front of it, that doesn\'t work
2014-04-21T20:53:55 <anastasiac> thanks for the tip, jessm
2014-04-21T20:54:10 <anastasiac> oh, that helps a lot :-)

2014-04-21T20:55:57 <anastasiac> yeah, that page shouldn\'t be pointing to current demos, it should point to the released 1.4 demos
2014-04-21T20:56:12 <jessm> but it isn\'t?
2014-04-21T20:56:13 <jessm> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion14/Renderer+-+Simple+Text
2014-04-21T20:56:21 <jessm> i dont\xe2\x80\x99 know what i\xe2\x80\x99m looking for unfortunately
2014-04-21T20:56:36 <danaayotte> neither do I anastasiac :(
2014-04-21T20:56:53 <anastasiac> ah, those are the instructional demos. blech, what a mess
2014-04-21T20:57:48 <anastasiac> danaayotte and jessm, let\'s not worry about anything in the "infusion14" space. That\'s lower priority, I think

2014-04-21T21:23:06 <jessm> speech crashes it
2014-04-21T21:23:12 <jessm> do you know if we have any other known bugs?
2014-04-21T21:23:37 <jessm> anastasiac: priorities we just talked about seem to be: 1. UIO integration to Floe page, 2. getting JTs text in tonight
2014-04-21T21:24:10 <jessm> jhung: and was the floe main page tested across browsers? I think I know the answer to this one
2014-04-21T21:25:30 <jhung> jessm: I\'ve been using Mac browsers. I\'ll double-check w Windows now.
2014-04-21T21:25:41 <jessm> jhung: great
2014-04-21T21:25:58 <jessm> jhung: is there a recommended browser for all of this? Chrome? Firefox?
2014-04-21T21:26:47 <jhung> jessm: yes Chrome and FF. Possibly IE11 (wait\xe2\x80\xa6 did I just say that?). Will have to confirm IE11 for sure though.

2014-04-21T13:55:36 <jhung> Sure michelled.
2014-04-21T13:55:43 <michelled> thanks
2014-04-21T14:06:48 <danaayotte> hi michelled, jhung: I took a look at the demo too.  It\'s looking great!  michelled we talked last week about making the overview panel scrollable, as the Close button can disappear off the bottom of the screen.  Will there be time to fix this?  Also, I have some suggestions to make the Overview panel instructions clearer, should I send them to list?
2014-04-21T14:09:00 <michelled> danaayotte: I doubt there will be time to fix the scrolling before tomorrow.
2014-04-21T14:09:17 <michelled> jhung: is there a JIRA that would be appropriate for danaayotte to put improved instructions on?
2014-04-21T14:10:27 <jhung> danaayotte: you can attach a comment to FLOE-178.
2014-04-21T14:10:52 <michelled> jhung: once she has, can you please address it?
2014-04-21T14:11:19 <danaayotte> ok jhung
2014-04-21T14:12:14 <jhung> michelled: depends on the nature of the change. It may have to fit into the queue with the other tasks to do today.
2014-04-21T14:12:31 <michelled> makes sense
2014-04-21T14:13:31 <jhung> michelled: FYI, I filed FLOE-184 which may affect the demo. Basically on first load of the demo, the content may not look right. The layout is all wrong and content may not show up. Reloading and Restarting the demo should fix it.
2014-04-21T14:13:41 <jhung> ^ Jutta may want to be aware of this.
2014-04-21T14:14:15 <jhung> By "Restarting" I mean pressing the "Restart Demo" button on the page.
2014-04-21T14:18:12 <jhung> michelled:  otherwise the demo looks good.
2014-04-21T14:20:46 <michelled> thanks jhung
2014-04-21T14:30:43 <jhung> michelled: I see that "Update Links" section on the PiratePad duplicates some tasks. I think we should remove this duplicate.

2014-04-21T15:50:48 <danaayotte> and one other suggested change :)

2014-04-21T16:16:26 <michelled> jhung: when I try to load the resource into the metadata demo, it doesn\'t show up: http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/html/resource.html?name=Climate_Change_Impacts
2014-04-21T16:16:31 <michelled> does it work for you?
2014-04-21T16:17:07 <jhung> This is the bug I was telling you about michelled. Restart the demo.
2014-04-21T16:18:11 <michelled> ugh - I see what you mean about it being confusing
2014-04-21T16:18:20 <michelled> I thought you meant the issue was on the first page
2014-04-21T16:18:49 <jhung> sorry I should have been more clear on that. I\'ll update the jira for that.

2014-04-21T17:10:00 <anastasiac> jhung, just checking in. The video links are ready. Where are you at? What can I do next? Have you started on the video page for the floe site yet?
2014-04-21T17:11:03 <jhung> anastasiac: I have not started video page for Floe. You can take that if you want. I\'m updating instruction text on Metadata right now.
2014-04-21T17:11:12 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\'ll start on the video page
2014-04-21T17:11:22 <jhung> anastasiac: what is the link for the screen cast?
2014-04-21T17:11:26 <anastasiac> michelled, any ETA on merging the climate change demo?
2014-04-21T17:11:29 <anastasiac> http://static.idrc.ocad.ca/videos/Floe-GPII-prefs-editors.webm
2014-04-21T17:11:39 <jhung> thanks anastasiac
2014-04-21T17:11:40 <anastasiac> or http://static.idrc.ocad.ca/videos/Floe-GPII-prefs-editors.mp4
2014-04-21T17:11:49 <jhung> oh
2014-04-21T17:12:06 <jhung> I guess we\'ll have to provide both links because of browser support.
2014-04-21T17:12:27 <jhung> Got a quick sec to chat anastasiac?
2014-04-21T17:12:37 <anastasiac> sure, jhung
2014-04-21T17:18:31 <jhung> anastasiac: here is my branch which includes dana\'s updated text. There is a placeholder at Line 65 for the link to the video page. https://github.com/jhung/floeproject.org/tree/FLOE-181
2014-04-21T17:18:47 <anastasiac> jhung, great, thanks
2014-04-21T17:24:37 <jhung> michelled or anastasiac: Can either of you take a look at this pull request for Metadata demo? I updated the instruction text. https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/24
2014-04-21T17:26:41 <michelled> jhung: sure
2014-04-21T17:26:59 <michelled> jhung: looks like the only broken link on the floe site is the one for the metatdata demo
2014-04-21T17:27:06 <michelled> would you be able to make a pull request for that fix?
2014-04-21T17:28:37 <jhung> michelled: yes, that will be fixed as part of FLOE-181. anastasiac will have that fix included with the updates with the video page.
2014-04-21T17:28:51 <michelled> nice, thanks
2014-04-21T17:28:58 <michelled> jhung: do you know if dana will be back?
2014-04-21T17:29:36 <jhung> michelled: I don\'t know. Sorry.
2014-04-21T17:30:30 <jhung> anastasiac: I just checked my FLOE-181 branch, and it does not include the updated URL for metadata. Can you make sure the updated URL gets in there?
2014-04-21T17:31:05 <anastasiac> will do, jhung. Do you know the correct URL?
2014-04-21T17:35:14 <jhung> anastasiac: http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/html/index.html
2014-04-21T17:35:32 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung

2014-04-21T17:46:25 <anastasiac> ok, michelled, I\'ve closed the old pull request and issued a new one: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/494
2014-04-21T17:47:06 <michelled> thanks anastasiac!
2014-04-21T18:01:11 <michelled> anastasiac: climate change is finally in master!
2014-04-21T18:01:31 <anastasiac> yay!
2014-04-21T18:01:43 <anastasiac> now we just need one more deploy by avtar, michelled
2014-04-21T18:02:34 <michelled> I guess he\'s at his appointment - we\'ll ping him when he\'s back
2014-04-21T18:03:13 <danaayotte> michelled what do you think of this
2014-04-21T18:03:15 <danaayotte> The FLOE metadata authoring components can be integrated into existing content editors to allow authors to create or edit metadata that accompanies the content of their Open Education Resource (OER).  For the purposes of this demo, the metadata components are shown within a simple content editor.
2014-04-21T18:04:01 <michelled> that\'s perfect danaayotte
2014-04-21T18:04:03 <michelled> thanks!
2014-04-21T18:04:18 <michelled> jhung: can you please make that change?
2014-04-21T18:04:27 <danaayotte> great michelled.  i\'ll add  comment to FLOE-178 as well
2014-04-21T18:04:37 <michelled> thanks
2014-04-21T18:06:03 <anastasiac> michelled, pull request for the updated floe site: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/6  Has a page for the screencast, updated metadata demo link and updated link to climate change demo, in readiness for the merge
2014-04-21T18:06:26 <michelled> nice
2014-04-21T18:06:36 <anastasiac> michelled, please let me know what you think of the text on the screencast page. It\'s the text danaayotte drafted when it was going to be a news item.
2014-04-21T18:10:15 <anastasiac> jhung, checking in again. I\'ve issued a pull request for the updated floe site, looking for my next task. Where are you at, what can I help with?
2014-04-21T18:10:41 <anastasiac> fyi, jhung and michelled, I\'ve been trying to keep the piratePad up to date, striking out things done
2014-04-21T18:11:13 <anastasiac> jhung, it looks like the build site is next. Have you started on that?
2014-04-21T18:16:09 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'m looking into implementing danaayotte\'s comments on the metadata demo overview panel text right now
2014-04-21T18:16:45 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-04-21T18:16:47 <jhung> anastasiac: yes I have started on that - waiting for the URL for the Climate Change demo
2014-04-21T18:17:03 <anastasiac> jhung, ok, sorry
2014-04-21T18:17:39 <anastasiac> jhung, ok, let\'s get in sync. You\'ve started on the build site, right? but not on dana\'s latest updates to metadata demo overview panel?
2014-04-21T18:18:23 <anastasiac> jhung, the new url for the climate change demo will be: http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/demos/prefsFramework/
2014-04-21T18:18:59 <jhung> anastasiac: I just crossed that off. I submitted a pull request for that change.
2014-04-21T18:19:41 <anastasiac> jhung, in the channel at 2:03pm, dana added more text - does your pull request include that?
