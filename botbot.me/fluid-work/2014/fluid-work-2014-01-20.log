2014-01-20T16:46:44 <anastasiac> jhung, I've merged IDI-118 into the dev branch and pushed it. Once it's double-checked on dev site, I'll merge into master. I also added the missing pic of Geoff Shea
2014-01-20T16:47:12 <anastasiac> jhung, not sure how frequently dev site updates from github

2014-01-20T17:29:36 <jhung> sure danaayotte. Justin_o_, cindyli - is 2pm okay?
2014-01-20T17:29:46 <cindyli> fine with me
2014-01-20T17:30:19 <Justin_o_> jhung: that works for me too
2014-01-20T17:30:25 <Justin_o_> michelled: if you are interested ^

2014-01-20T18:06:06 <cindyli> danaayotte: can you send me the link to the wireframe for metadata demo? thanks
2014-01-20T18:09:53 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i've filed a new jira for separating simpleEditor.js from the rest of the metadata demo http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-164
2014-01-20T18:10:09 <cindyli> nice, thanks, Justin_o_

2014-01-20T18:11:17 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2014-01-20T18:12:31 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i guess we should make the transcripts panel too, since that's what FLOE-116 is actually for.. i'll do that first instead :)
2014-01-20T18:12:51 <cindyli> ya
2014-01-20T18:13:44 <danaayotte> cindyli: latest design (which I am still tweaking) is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9dlg5bfg3q462gy/metadata%20default%20design.pdf

2014-01-20T18:16:03 <Justin_o_> cindyli: did we have one for captions?
2014-01-20T18:16:07 <Justin_o_> i wonder if i've lost it
2014-01-20T18:16:14 <cindyli> yes, we had
2014-01-20T18:24:30 <Justin_o_> cindyli: can you tell me how you add it?
