b'2014-11-19T15:31:34 <Bosmon> Also I have a somewhat hilarious fix for your valueMapper issue that involved removing about 30 lines of code from ModelTransformations.js ...
2014-11-19T15:33:39 <cindyli> thanks for those fixes, Bosmon. i\'m thinking probably someone who knows more about the core of the model transformation should review the pull for valueMapper
2014-11-19T15:34:10 <Bosmon> We should be clear that the "defaultOutputValue" for the valueMapper doesn\'t necessarily have the meaning that you are expecting - rather than being "the output in the situation when no case matches", it is actually "the default output value to be applied if the matching case doesn\'t supply one"
2014-11-19T15:34:24 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ping
2014-11-19T15:34:33 <kasparnet> slim_jim: pong
2014-11-19T15:34:35 <Bosmon> In general the valueMapper will produce no output in case it cannot locate a definite case in its options to match
2014-11-19T15:35:15 <cindyli> got it, Bosmon
2014-11-19T15:35:25 <slim_jim> kasparnet: I\'ll only be able to make the Architecture meeting for about 15 due to a new conflict - dog training would you believe.
2014-11-19T15:35:41 <Bosmon> So my fix takes the form of introducing an explicit "match-all" case that matches more weakly than the "true, true" case
2014-11-19T15:35:41 <kasparnet> slim_jim: ok
2014-11-19T15:35:45 <slim_jim> kasparnet: it seems the WIndows instalation is still a problem though
2014-11-19T15:35:49 <Bosmon> As well as fixing the underlying implementation
2014-11-19T15:36:00 <Bosmon> slim_jim - what kind of problem have you found?
2014-11-19T15:36:22 <slim_jim> kasper: I\'m not finding - it\'s a thread on email with a a couple having problems
2014-11-19T15:37:23 <slim_jim> kasparnet: If I have time tomorrow I\'ll run through again a couple of times with the installer. Trouble is I\'m drowning in the year 3 report admin
2014-11-19T15:41:01 <kasparnet> slim_jim: ok - else Thanos might be able to take over some of the work
2014-11-19T15:44:08 <jhernandez> slim_jim: dog training? really? xD
2014-11-19T15:47:31 <slim_jim> jhernandez: yeah! Honest! Is a dogfrom a rescue centre so tends not to come back when called and other stuff. Gotta fix it.

2014-11-19T22:36:43 <colinclark> ah yes
2014-11-19T22:36:44 <colinclark> ugh
2014-11-19T22:37:05 <colinclark> What would it look like for us to put together the Awesomest Ansible Playbook In The World?
2014-11-19T22:37:49 <colinclark> i.e. something that would let a developer spin up a VM dedicated solely to the task of serving HTML using a static publishing workflow
2014-11-19T22:37:58 <colinclark> with basic access to configuring redirects, etc.
2014-11-19T22:39:43 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2014-11-19T22:40:31 <avtar> so just a nginx instance and specifying key/value redirect pairs using ansible?
2014-11-19T22:40:47 <colinclark> well, i\'m not sure
2014-11-19T22:41:20 <colinclark> I was thinking more along the lines of making it easy for people to spin up VMs that are "low maintenance"
2014-11-19T22:41:29 <colinclark> static sites are as low as i can imagine
2014-11-19T22:41:47 <colinclark> and then they can administer the basic sorts of things that most people who know HTML can handle administering
2014-11-19T22:41:52 <colinclark> such as redirects in nginx or whatever
2014-11-19T22:42:22 <colinclark> and then, in this other universe, someone like Jonathan would just spin up a VM for the Fluid site and be responsible for it essentially autonomously
2014-11-19T22:42:48 <colinclark> and you could sit back, reassured that there are no CMSes or other craziness to administer
2014-11-19T22:42:50 <colinclark> and I can sit back knowing that URLs will never break
2014-11-19T22:43:01 <colinclark> maybe some mojitos thrown in there somewhere
2014-11-19T22:43:34 * kasparnet has quit
2014-11-19T22:46:41 <avtar> creating this type of nginx role should be fairly easy. i guess it\'s more about how access to the nginx VM is handled.
2014-11-19T22:46:55 <avtar> or more accurately how the role is executed on the vm by jon
2014-11-19T22:46:59 <colinclark> right
2014-11-19T22:47:40 <avtar> the fastest and easiest approach would be he has direct ssh access and runs ansible on his local machine which then logs into the nginx vm and deploys his changes
2014-11-19T22:48:30 <avtar> the more elegant approach would be setting up something like rundeck to do ansible runs
2014-11-19T22:48:35 <colinclark> interesting
2014-11-19T22:48:39 <colinclark> I like the less fast way
2014-11-19T22:48:52 <colinclark> in that I can imagine the ideal situation is that people would rarely or never need SSH-level access
2014-11-19T22:49:14 <colinclark> but would continue to interact with the site via pushing to a Git repository
2014-11-19T22:49:16 <avtar> ansible, the company, has a commercial offering http://www.ansible.com/tower
2014-11-19T22:49:25 * danaayotte has quit
2014-11-19T22:49:38 <avtar> rundeck is free but i guess requires time to research and set up with ansible
2014-11-19T22:50:00 <avtar> sorry, one sec
2014-11-19T22:50:04 <colinclark> take your time

2014-11-19T23:09:54 <avtar> so something like tower would be nice given the ansible context but it\'s pricey
2014-11-19T23:11:38 <avtar> rundeck appears to be a generic task runner that provides a web ui and api so tasks could be triggered as part of a successful test in jenkins

b'2014-11-19T00:00:14 <jhernandez> Bosmon: around?
2014-11-19T00:02:31 <jhernandez> anyhoo ... I took a look at the issue with jqUnit on android
2014-11-19T00:05:10 <jhernandez> it doesn\'t reach this portion of code https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/blob/master/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L187
2014-11-19T00:09:23 <Bosmon> hey
2014-11-19T00:09:29 <jhernandez> ho
2014-11-19T00:10:07 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/blob/master/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L174
2014-11-19T00:10:57 <Bosmon> This is the patch put in by sbates
2014-11-19T00:11:13 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-19T00:11:18 <jhernandez> not working in android
2014-11-19T00:11:27 <jhernandez> :/
2014-11-19T00:12:09 <Bosmon> So this was one cause of output being lost due to premature exit of the process
2014-11-19T00:12:42 <Bosmon> The question is, why on earth does the process exit if we are still in the middle of the QUnit run
2014-11-19T00:13:08 <Bosmon> So it seems that there is another control path leading to exit on android - the reason would probably be suggested by looking at the QUnit code
2014-11-19T00:15:43 <Bosmon> jhernandez
2014-11-19T00:15:55 <jhernandez> Bosmon
2014-11-19T00:16:16 <Bosmon> So what you say doesn\'t make sense
2014-11-19T00:16:26 <jhernandez> cool!
2014-11-19T00:16:31 <Bosmon> You said you see SOME PART of the test end message
2014-11-19T00:16:38 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-19T00:16:43 <jhernandez> heh
2014-11-19T00:16:53 * Justin_o has quit
2014-11-19T00:17:03 <Bosmon> And yet you say that the QUnit.done callback doesn\'t execute
2014-11-19T00:17:07 <Bosmon> This is completely impossible
2014-11-19T00:17:14 * jhung joined the channel
2014-11-19T00:17:17 <Bosmon> So I ask you to explain by what means you determined that the callback doesn\'t execute
2014-11-19T00:17:51 <jhernandez> put console.logs everywhere
2014-11-19T00:18:43 <jhernandez> and all I can say is that it is never called, or at least, this is what it wants us to believe in
2014-11-19T00:18:46 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-11-19T00:20:57 * jhung has quit
2014-11-19T00:21:06 <Bosmon> ok sure
2014-11-19T00:21:12 <Bosmon> So what is the final line of output you get from the test run?
2014-11-19T00:21:39 * jhung joined the channel
2014-11-19T00:22:36 * jhung has quit
2014-11-19T00:23:21 <jhernandez> jq: Test concluded - Module "GPII Android Settings" Test name "Running tests for androidSettings node module": 11/11 passed - PASS
2014-11-19T00:25:17 <Bosmon> ok
2014-11-19T00:25:29 <Bosmon> So can you wrap the whole of the callback on line 187 in a log statement
2014-11-19T00:25:48 <Bosmon> so that it reads, QUnit.done(function (data) {
2014-11-19T00:25:53 <Bosmon> log something
2014-11-19T00:26:04 <Bosmon> return fluid.debounce(data) { ..... etc
2014-11-19T00:26:05 <jhernandez> already did that
2014-11-19T00:26:08 <Bosmon> gah
2014-11-19T00:26:14 <Bosmon> And that is not logged either
2014-11-19T00:26:18 <jhernandez> yup
2014-11-19T00:26:49 <Bosmon> Ok, well obviously node on android has an extremely fundamental bug
2014-11-19T00:28:09 <Bosmon> It is somehow managing to find a way to exit even when there are tasks queued for future events
2014-11-19T00:30:21 * jhernandez shrugs
2014-11-19T00:30:23 <Bosmon> jhernandez - you can try putting some logging around line 1460 of qunit.js
2014-11-19T00:30:34 <Bosmon> Or around the "process" function in general
2014-11-19T00:30:44 <jhernandez> ok, hold a sec

2014-11-19T00:43:09 <jhernandez> logging in qunit.js is beginning with ######
2014-11-19T00:43:51 <Bosmon> jhernandez - so why does done() cause end of process?
2014-11-19T00:44:02 <Bosmon> It should run our callback first
2014-11-19T00:44:32 <jhernandez> yup
2014-11-19T00:45:08 <jhernandez> it should be "done" after all the process is finished
2014-11-19T00:45:49 * jhung joined the channel
2014-11-19T00:47:03 <jhernandez> do you want me to stringify anything in particular, or do some other logging around other code?
2014-11-19T00:47:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, you can look inside the done function
2014-11-19T00:47:19 <Bosmon> Lines 1250 to 1320
2014-11-19T00:47:31 <Bosmon> In particular see if it gets as far as the "runLoggingCallbacks" on line 1315
2014-11-19T00:48:51 * jhung has quit
2014-11-19T00:54:56 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-19T00:54:58 <jhernandez> http://pastebin.com/p5VdG6a7
2014-11-19T00:56:13 <Bosmon> aha ok
2014-11-19T00:56:18 <Bosmon> so it does actually execute
2014-11-19T00:56:23 <Bosmon> Just somehow no callback is queued
2014-11-19T00:57:05 <Bosmon> Have a look at what is actually in QUnit.done - if it is an array, what is its length?
2014-11-19T01:01:55 <jhernandez> where exactly?
2014-11-19T01:02:18 * kasparnet has quit
2014-11-19T01:03:23 <jhernandez> in jqUnit-node.js right after declaring it?
2014-11-19T01:17:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez - at any time
2014-11-19T01:17:21 <Bosmon> And especially just as we enter the "done" function

2014-11-19T01:57:39 <Bosmon> jhernandez - sorry, I meant QUnit.config.done
2014-11-19T01:57:47 <Bosmon> I\'m sure you can work out this control flow yourself :)
2014-11-19T02:05:43 <jhernandez> ok, QUnit.config.done is an empty array
2014-11-19T02:06:08 <jhernandez> actually, it is [ null ]
2014-11-19T02:09:55 <jhernandez> in any case, tomorrow I\'ll try to keep diving more into this, I\'m still working on the universal side of the pull request for android

2014-11-19T12:16:53 <dimokas> Hi. Did anyone know which is the common term about auto Adjust adjuster?
2014-11-19T12:20:54 * jhung has quit
2014-11-19T12:22:22 <kasparnet> dimokas: I dont think a decision has been made on this.. I guess we should just find a suitable name and run it by the list to see if anyone has any objections
2014-11-19T12:22:54 <kasparnet> perhaps Bosmon or jhernandez has an opinion on this
2014-11-19T12:23:25 <kasparnet> we need a common term (user preference) for expressing whether the system configuration should automatically adjust to environment/context changes or not
2014-11-19T12:23:39 <kasparnet> during runtime, that is
2014-11-19T12:25:22 <kasparnet> so just throwing out a few options for feedback: autoAdjustConfiguration, autoAdjustFromContext, allowDynamicAdjustment, allowAutoAdjust, allowAutoAdjustFromContext
