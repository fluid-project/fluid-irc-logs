b"2014-01-21T23:38:16 <colinclark> avtar: thanks--this might be okay for someone like Thanos who knows a bit about Windows
2014-01-21T23:39:20 <sgithens> colinclark avtar : Yes thanks!  Sorry for dropping in and out, fires keep coming up for me to put out :)
2014-01-21T23:39:27 <colinclark> no worries at all

2014-01-21T23:50:05 <avtar> colinclark: there's also that chocolatey project
2014-01-21T23:50:12 <colinclark> right
2014-01-21T23:50:17 <avtar> but i guess it would be a similar comparison
2014-01-21T23:50:35 <avtar> where software would not be getting packaged the orthodox way
2014-01-21T23:50:57 <avtar> just more convenient right now
2014-01-21T23:52:43 <colinclark> Would it require any kind of dependencies on the Windows box, prior to installation?
2014-01-21T23:53:29 <avtar> chocolatey?

2014-01-21T23:55:15 <avtar> there is an installation process before you one can start installing packages using it
2014-01-21T23:55:56 <avtar> but that wixtoolset project looks like it can create msi packages so those alone would suffice
2014-01-21T23:58:05 <colinclark> there is a significant advantage to that
2014-01-21T23:59:03 <colinclark> since the typical installation process for a Windows user involves double-clicking on either an MSI or an exe

b'2014-01-21T17:53:09 <Justin_o_> jhung: cindyli will Skype you
2014-01-21T17:53:18 <jhung> sure.
2014-01-21T17:54:54 <colinclark> jessm: I guess the answer to that question is directly connected with the test design
2014-01-21T17:54:56 <colinclark> if that makes sense
2014-01-21T17:57:38 <jessm> colinclark: not sure i understand. i\'m getting confused now. can we just expect the user to \'save and apply\' under all circumstances for the pilot since there are so few #1s?
2014-01-21T17:58:04 <colinclark> jessm: You asked "is it beneficial to get feedback from users during the pilot on live updates?"
2014-01-21T17:58:16 <jessm> yes
2014-01-21T17:58:34 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2014-01-21T17:58:34 <colinclark> My answer to that is that it depends on how the test is designed
2014-01-21T17:58:36 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-21T17:58:41 <colinclark> the pilot test
2014-01-21T17:59:12 <jessm> colinclark: so, should kasparnet and eleni weigh in on that then?
2014-01-21T17:59:23 <colinclark> I think if it\'s clearly described to them, yes
2014-01-21T17:59:45 <colinclark> As far as whether we should bother to live update anything, I think that there are some important reasons why we need the ability to demonstrate this functionality
2014-01-21T17:59:50 <colinclark> even if it is currently limited today
2014-01-21T18:00:28 <colinclark> this doesn\'t mean that it has to feature as part of the pilots, but we do need to be able to illustrate to the EC that is a capability that our architecture supports, even if the applications themselves need to do some work to support it
2014-01-21T18:00:48 <colinclark> and I think there\'s some incentive to those developers to be able to see how their application is different from others that do support live updates
2014-01-21T18:01:14 <colinclark> again, this is a separate issue from the actual pilot experience
2014-01-21T18:02:27 <jessm> colinclark: what do you think of splitting PCP tests into 1. a PCP that only supports those prefs that live update and 2. a PCP that supports more prefs and requires save and apply?
2014-01-21T18:02:43 <colinclark> that seems like a reasonable approach to me
2014-01-21T18:03:27 <jessm> colinclark: so, we\'ll kick that recommendation up on the list and see what Eleni and kasparnet think. does it create much more work for the PCP dev team? michelled any thoughts there?
2014-01-21T18:04:03 <colinclark> As it stands, I believe the system can distinguish between preferences that can be applied immediately ones that use save and apply.
2014-01-21T18:04:15 <colinclark> I believe there are some bugs that need to be addressed with this, but the infrastructure is there
2014-01-21T18:04:38 <colinclark> I don\'t know what the status of the actual UI is, but based on this morning\'s conversation, it sounds like there is some work that will need to be done at that level
2014-01-21T18:06:56 <anastasiac> cindyli1, Justin_o_, a question regarding the UIO component: How would I go about overriding the \'tocTemplate\' option? I\'m trying to figure out what option configuration I should be using, but it\'s a bit spaghetti...
2014-01-21T18:07:08 <michelled> kasparnet and I are currently going through the pilot scenario and making sure that any work that is remaining is JIRAed up. Now would be a perfect time to clarify the scenario, if need be
2014-01-21T18:07:23 <michelled> once we are clear with our impression of what is being tested, we\'ll be sure to send that out to the lists
2014-01-21T18:17:00 <cindyli1> anastasiac: in schema version of UIO or grade version?
2014-01-21T18:17:18 <anastasiac> cindyli1, using the out-of-the-box uio component

2014-01-21T19:49:35 <anastasiac> will do, jhung
2014-01-21T19:49:45 <jhung> thanks anastasiac!
2014-01-21T20:01:04 <michelled> Bosmon, anastasiac: actually, it seems like that test failure is explainable. We probably need to change something about what we deploy. Basically, on the nightly build site we deploy a built package like what someone would get if they used but builder. That package does not include the build-scripts directory.
2014-01-21T20:01:27 <michelled> when we are running tests on our machines, we would have the build scripts directory available, so the tests would pass.
2014-01-21T20:01:34 <michelled> I suppose our choices are
2014-01-21T20:01:49 <michelled> 1. move this test out from the preferences framework section
2014-01-21T20:02:12 <michelled> 2. deploy build-scripts on the nightly build server
2014-01-21T20:03:05 <Bosmon> 2 seems reasonable
2014-01-21T20:03:08 <michelled> the third option is likely what we were doing before which was stripping out "CSSGenerator-test" from all-tests - but given that it\'s a manual process, it is prone to breakage and resulting confusion
2014-01-21T20:03:09 <Bosmon> Since clearly we want this test online
2014-01-21T20:03:43 <michelled> yes, I think that makes sense Bosmon - otherwise, we\'ll rarely run it
2014-01-21T20:03:56 <Bosmon> We want more tests around, not fewer :)

2014-01-21T22:14:27 <jhung> Hi anastasiac - I\'ve updated FLOE-162. It\'s getting a bit messy because the work in FLOE-162 and FLOE-163 are overlapping a lot now. So whenever I fix something in FLOE-162, it causes conflicts in FLOE-163.
2014-01-21T22:15:00 <jhung> So is it possible to merge the pull request even if there are some issues? the next pull request should take care of most of them.
2014-01-21T22:15:27 <jhung> thanks!
2014-01-21T22:18:58 <anastasiac> jhung, if we\'re not deploying this static site yet, I\'m ok with merging your master. give me a minute or two
2014-01-21T22:21:19 <anastasiac> jhung, it seems I don\'t have permissions to push to the fluid-project/floeproject.org repo; would you like to add me to the project team for the repo?
2014-01-21T22:24:28 <anastasiac> yeah, I can\'t see any way to even find out who can push to it
2014-01-21T22:25:08 <jhung> I can add you as an op but not sure if there\'s a procedure we should follow to grant this?
2014-01-21T22:25:27 <anastasiac> dunno
2014-01-21T22:25:42 <anastasiac> maybe at the very least check with the higher-ups that they\'re ok with that?
2014-01-21T22:26:18 <anastasiac> We have the general process for granting commit access for infusion; not sure if we\'re using the same process for something like this, jhung
2014-01-21T22:26:26 <anastasiac> we\'d need to start with someone, at the very least :-)
2014-01-21T22:26:52 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'ve pushed the new master
2014-01-21T22:27:01 <jhung> :) thanks
2014-01-21T22:27:10 <anastasiac> it\'s looking great, jhung

2014-01-21T22:46:33 <colinclark> For the GPII, you mean?
2014-01-21T22:46:35 <sgithens> yeah
2014-01-21T22:46:41 <colinclark> There isn\'t one
2014-01-21T22:46:48 <colinclark> It\'s just some app that Thanos runs
2014-01-21T22:47:04 <sgithens> ah, it came up in our LGS call just now
2014-01-21T22:47:19 <colinclark> Well, okay, that\'s not quite true
2014-01-21T22:47:21 <colinclark> http://blogs.cloud4all.info/developers/2013/10/08/installing-cloud4allgpii-in-windows-7/#step1
2014-01-21T22:47:26 <colinclark> There is an executable you can install there
2014-01-21T22:47:30 <colinclark> but I assume it\'s quite out of date
2014-01-21T22:47:36 <colinclark> and there\'s no way for any of us to build it
2014-01-21T22:47:53 <colinclark> Last I talked to Thanos (on list), he\'s going to create an automated way to build the installer
2014-01-21T22:48:03 <colinclark> and then we can commit the scripts or configuration for this right into the repo
2014-01-21T22:48:07 <colinclark> and build installers nightly
2014-01-21T22:48:18 <colinclark> avtar has a plan for what he thinks we should do on Linux
2014-01-21T22:48:50 <avtar> that much is true
2014-01-21T22:50:47 <sgithens> :)
2014-01-21T22:51:05 <sgithens> Didn\'t Javi or someone start making linux packages
2014-01-21T22:51:13 <avtar> i was saying that it would be helpful to create builds (maybe using Makefiles) that would clone repos, install any dependencies using npm, and create rpms or debs using this project https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm
2014-01-21T22:52:46 <colinclark> sgithens: Javi has something, but I never did fully understand how we would manage it
2014-01-21T22:53:18 <colinclark> whereas I think avtar\'s fpm approach would allow us to directly script it using fpm, and thus build packages nightly and as part of the release process
2014-01-21T22:53:43 <colinclark> It wouldn\'t hurt, by the way, to respond to the thread with Thanos telling him you\'re keen to see the installer automated for the LGS, too
2014-01-21T22:54:11 <avtar> is the end goal that gpii components ship with linux distributions?
2014-01-21T22:55:45 <colinclark> yes, in the long run
2014-01-21T22:56:33 <avtar> i guess that bridge can be crossed later but packages probably won\'t get accepted by fedora or debian/ubuntu if their toolsets aren\'t used
2014-01-21T22:56:59 <avtar> in the short term fpm can save us a lot of work
2014-01-21T22:57:16 <sgithens> sorry, just got off the call
2014-01-21T22:58:13 <sgithens> so, my current windows GPII is old and pretty broken.   I want to isntall fresh for this weekend at ALA.  Should i use master or the review meetin branch?
2014-01-21T22:58:21 <sgithens> colinclark
2014-01-21T22:58:41 <colinclark> sgithens: It\'s a good question
2014-01-21T22:58:46 <colinclark> It depends on what you want to demonstrate
2014-01-21T22:58:46 <sgithens> :)
2014-01-21T22:59:05 <colinclark> master should be just fine, unless you\'ll be demonstrating some of the preferences sets that we showed at the review
2014-01-21T22:59:23 <sgithens> some contrast, keyboard, and NVDA might be nice
2014-01-21T22:59:31 <colinclark> should be just fine master
2014-01-21T22:59:32 <sgithens> I don\'t think it needs to be crazy
2014-01-21T22:59:34 <colinclark> Will Gregg be there?
2014-01-21T23:00:45 <sgithens> I don\'t think he is, but I\'m double checking
2014-01-21T23:01:49 <sgithens> he\'s not
2014-01-21T23:09:18 <avtar> colinclark, sgithens: here\'s one option for windows http://wixtoolset.org/about/
2014-01-21T23:09:40 <avtar> it doesn\'t appear to be simple though
2014-01-21T23:09:50 <colinclark> sgithens: do you have any further impression about what days you\'ll be able to attend San Diego?
2014-01-21T23:10:04 <colinclark> I\'m trying to find a house that can fit us all, since I believe Jess and Dana are also going to be there for a few days

2014-01-21T15:19:53 <colinclark> The number of settings in category #1 is currently very limited--they\'re only on Linux, and they tend to include a few of the built-in settings
2014-01-21T15:20:29 <vjoanna> I don\'t understand the third point - why does the user need to log out?
2014-01-21T15:23:00 <Jess_> so, in lieu of #2, the user needs to log out (#3), right?
2014-01-21T15:23:10 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-21T15:23:32 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-01-21T15:23:52 <danaayotte> is The Solution the PCP?or an individual app?
2014-01-21T15:24:21 <danaayotte> re: #2
2014-01-21T15:25:25 <Jess_> did we lose colinclark ?
2014-01-21T15:27:48 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-21T15:28:09 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-01-21T15:28:39 <colinclark> Sorry
2014-01-21T15:28:42 <colinclark> I\'m here
2014-01-21T15:29:19 <colinclark> So, the vast majority of settings currently are in category #2--that the Solution needs to be stopped and started back up again
2014-01-21T15:29:36 <colinclark> this is because most apps today aren\'t written to expect that their settings will change on the fly, outside of their control
2014-01-21T15:29:48 <colinclark> As for #3, vjoanna, the answer to that question is pretty simple, and sad
2014-01-21T15:29:51 <colinclark> Windows really sucks
2014-01-21T15:30:16 <colinclark> It appears that there is simply no way to apply some settings on Windows, such as font size, without forcing the user to login and logout
2014-01-21T15:30:26 <colinclark> Go ahead and try it on the Windows box on the desk beside you
2014-01-21T15:30:58 <colinclark> and you\'ll see sadly that even in the Windows Control Panel, it makes you log out/in for the changes to take effect
2014-01-21T15:31:15 <Jess_> wow
2014-01-21T15:31:17 <Jess_> that\'s insane
2014-01-21T15:31:30 <colinclark> danaayotte: "Solutions" are the assistive technologies, applications, and built-in access features that we configure, start, and stop
2014-01-21T15:34:04 <danaayotte> thanks colinclark.  so when you say log in and log out, you mean log in and log out of the system then, not GPII, right?
2014-01-21T15:34:23 <danaayotte> or I mean, the user would also be logged out of GPII I suppose
2014-01-21T15:34:44 <colinclark> danaayotte: Definitely try it out on Windows to see for yourself
2014-01-21T15:34:54 <colinclark> but I mean out of the whole computer
2014-01-21T15:34:58 <danaayotte> yes
2014-01-21T15:34:58 <colinclark> which of course means the GPII as well
2014-01-21T15:35:02 <danaayotte> yes
2014-01-21T15:35:33 <colinclark> Unfortunately, I expect that in time for the pilots, we won\'t have an automatic means for logging out/in the user from Windows
2014-01-21T15:36:00 <colinclark> Given all this information, my impression is that the developer folks need a concrete approach
2014-01-21T15:36:12 <colinclark> they need a wireframe that says "this should cover all the cases for the pilots" for this
2014-01-21T15:37:01 <colinclark> is that something you guys have some cycles to think through in depth?
2014-01-21T15:38:36 <vjoanna> I think removing the PCP from the user testing would simplify things, since its features are not that different from the PMT right now. If that\'s not an option, a \'save and apply\' button seems like the best solution to me. When a user clicks it, the PCP would take whatever actions necessary to apply the modified preferences. A notification could indicate how long it will take and what\'s going on to the user.
2014-01-21T15:39:26 <colinclark> I don\'t think it\'s an option, vjoanna
2014-01-21T15:39:41 <danaayotte> could we do something as simple as this? https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvncx1ybnk7pacu/PCP%20live%20apply%20rough.pdf
2014-01-21T15:39:43 <colinclark> I can certain ask, but we need to be able to report to the EC on the results of pilot testing all our deliverables
2014-01-21T15:41:06 <danaayotte> I agree that we lose the point of the PCP which is to apply changes live
2014-01-21T15:41:19 <vjoanna> danaayotte: the button label could also be changed to \'restart & apply\' - removing the second step
2014-01-21T15:41:33 <danaayotte> right
2014-01-21T15:41:51 <danaayotte> except that in some cases it\'ll be restart and some it\'ll be a logout
2014-01-21T15:41:53 <danaayotte> ?
2014-01-21T15:43:02 <vjoanna> i think what the user sees would be similar to restarting?
2014-01-21T15:43:57 <danaayotte> hmmm, if I understood Colin correctly...
2014-01-21T15:44:11 <danaayotte> #2 is restart applications but remain logged in (to system and to GPII)
2014-01-21T15:44:23 <danaayotte> #3 is log out of device and log back in
2014-01-21T15:44:56 <danaayotte> sorry I used system and device interchangeably there
2014-01-21T15:45:06 <Jess_> i think you\'ve got it right danaayotte
2014-01-21T15:46:27 <Jess_> danaayotte: vjoanna: i\'m heading in now. perhaps we can strategize about this, draw something up, and then bring it back to the channel?
2014-01-21T15:46:45 <Jess_> see you two in a few?
2014-01-21T15:46:52 <colinclark> yes, that sounds right, danaayotte
2014-01-21T15:46:59 <colinclark> we can restart an application pretty quickly and smoothly
2014-01-21T15:47:07 * Jess_ has quit
2014-01-21T15:47:28 <colinclark> obviously we can\'t log out of their account on Windows and log back in smoothly
2014-01-21T15:47:31 <danaayotte> so it would look pretty different to the user (#2 vs #3)
2014-01-21T15:47:37 <colinclark> I\'ll be talking to Microsoft about this issue, for the record
2014-01-21T15:47:42 <colinclark> so we can address the systemic problem
2014-01-21T15:47:45 <colinclark> but that will take time
2014-01-21T15:47:55 <colinclark> yes, #2 vs #3 will be very different
2014-01-21T15:48:03 <colinclark> we can see these three on a spectrum of disruptiveness
2014-01-21T15:48:09 <colinclark> where #1 is virtually seamless
2014-01-21T15:48:19 <colinclark> #2 is somewhat disruptive, or certainly has the potential to be
2014-01-21T15:48:23 <colinclark> and #3 is pretty drastic
2014-01-21T15:48:39 <vjoanna> is #3 always the case for windows devices?
2014-01-21T15:48:53 <danaayotte> or is it a spectre of disruption?! :)
2014-01-21T15:48:53 <colinclark> For a handful of settings
2014-01-21T15:48:57 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-21T15:49:00 <colinclark> kasparne_ can verify which ones
2014-01-21T15:59:20 <kasparne_> colinclark, vjoanna, danaayotte: am I understanding correctly if #3 is loggin in and out of windows (as opposed to GPII)
2014-01-21T15:59:24 <kasparne_> ?*
2014-01-21T15:59:27 <colinclark> yes, that\'s correct
2014-01-21T15:59:35 <kasparne_> if so, none of the settings we support right now require this
2014-01-21T16:00:02 <kasparne_> it is likely to be relevant for changing the font-size in windows
2014-01-21T16:00:37 <kasparne_> but for now, all windows settings should be covered by #1 and #2
2014-01-21T16:01:29 <danaayotte> so that doesn\'t apply to text size, kasparne_?
2014-01-21T16:02:23 <kasparne_> danaayotte: nope - we removed text-size support from windows for now, as it was buggy and was only applied to a few of the fonts in windows anyway
2014-01-21T16:02:31 <danaayotte> ah
2014-01-21T16:02:38 <danaayotte> right
2014-01-21T16:03:01 <colinclark> And it\'s clear to Eleni and the pilot testers that these settings won\'t be available, kasparne_?
2014-01-21T16:03:28 * kasparne_ is now known as kasparnet
2014-01-21T16:03:46 <kasparnet> colinclark: probably not :) ... I\'ll write her

2014-01-21T17:51:08 <jessm> back to our earlier conversation about #1 and #2
2014-01-21T17:52:16 <jessm> kasparnet: colinclark: and is it beneficial to get feedback from users during the pilot on live updates even if they\'re rare?
