2014-10-20T20:25:56 <jhung> If it looks okay to you, we can close FLUID-5515.

2014-10-20T20:27:56 <anastasiac> jhung, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look
2014-10-20T20:35:00 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding stylus in the fluidproject.org site: does docpad just automatically compile any stylus file it finds anywhere in the hierarchy?

2014-10-20T20:36:00 * anvk has quit
2014-10-20T20:36:03 <jhung> anastasiac: yes. As long as the .styl post-script is somewhere in the filename
2014-10-20T20:36:25 <anastasiac> jhung, is there anyway to tell docpad NOT to bother with a particular .styl file?
2014-10-20T20:36:46 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at the new mixins/functions: I want to use them, but not try to convert them to css
2014-10-20T20:41:14 <jhung> hmmm, you can just give it a different extension that won't be processed. Like .txt or .cfg? Docpad would just copy it instead of processing it.
2014-10-20T20:43:10 <anastasiac> hm. I\xe2\x80\x99m still learning Stylus, jhung, so there may be something I\xe2\x80\x99m missing, but: I want my .styl file to be able to use the functions defined in those files. Those files just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything in them that would result in actual CSS if you tried. I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s not harm, but I believe the process would produce empty css files
2014-10-20T20:44:04 <jhung> Hmmm. You can show me tomorrow when I'm in the office. I'm heading offline in a minute anastasiac
2014-10-20T20:44:11 <anastasiac> ok, thanks jhung

2014-10-20T13:32:00 <amilchev> hi, Bosmon, I\'ve been integrating  PMT/PCP  with Kasper\'s 784 branch (framework support for contexts & conditions prefs sets)
2014-10-20T13:33:43 <amilchev> Bosmon: so I should be using http PUT request for updating preferences, but I\'m getting "method PUT is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods" error
2014-10-20T13:34:10 <Bosmon> Hi amilchev - I know that kasparnet is working on this right now
2014-10-20T13:34:19 <amilchev> Bosmon: should the "PUT" method be added here https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/middleware.js#L133 ?
2014-10-20T13:34:20 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2014-10-20T13:34:21 <Bosmon> SInce he integrating his branch with my GPII-434 branch which fixes PUT support in our frameworks
2014-10-20T13:35:26 <kasparnet> amilchev: are you using the latest version of my branch? And have you rerun NPM install after deleting the "node_modules" folder in universal?
2014-10-20T13:35:39 <amilchev> Bosmon: as far as I know he\'s ready with integration https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/commits/GPII-784
2014-10-20T13:35:50 * yzen joined the channel
2014-10-20T13:36:51 <amilchev> kasparnet: if you\'re asking me whether I\'ve set up correctly - I think I have, since I don\'t receive the error we talked about (POST + PUT being throwing 500)
2014-10-20T13:37:04 <kasparnet> ok
2014-10-20T13:37:23 <amilchev> kasparnet: everything seems to be working as expected except for that UT is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods error
2014-10-20T13:37:38 <amilchev> which I was getting before and still getting now
2014-10-20T13:37:40 <kasparnet> what\'s the request you\'re getting the "Access-Control-Allow-Methods"?
2014-10-20T13:37:47 <Bosmon> amilchev - this looks like a CORS issue
2014-10-20T13:38:40 <Bosmon> Currently we have hardcoded into the system it seems that only "GET" and "OPTIONS" methods are authorized via this scheme
2014-10-20T13:38:51 <Bosmon> But I think we have never yet succeeded in understanding really why our CORS configuration is the way it is
2014-10-20T13:39:37 <amilchev> kasparnet: I\'m trying to make a PUT to http://localhost:8081/preferences/6f58b341-4ff3-43cc-b580-b55141c08685
2014-10-20T13:40:27 <amilchev> Bosmon: yes, I see that "GET" is "considered allowed" here https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/middleware.js#L133
2014-10-20T13:40:38 <amilchev> Bosmon: and "OPTIONS" here https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/middleware.js#L167
2014-10-20T13:41:11 <kasparnet> amilchev: I think you need to look in this branch: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/GPII-434
2014-10-20T13:41:12 <amilchev> Bosmon: so my question is should "PUT" be added somewhere as well or is this error something I\'m not supposed to receive
2014-10-20T13:41:23 <kasparnet> (which should be the one you have on your machine as well)
2014-10-20T13:41:38 <kasparnet> that should be the kettle version used by my branch
2014-10-20T13:41:46 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I think he has the right branch, as he has explained
2014-10-20T13:42:07 <Bosmon> amilchev - yes, you can experiment by modifying the Kettle line you mentioned, just to verify that this makes the error go away
2014-10-20T13:42:22 <Bosmon> amilchev - in practice we should just add this configuration directly to the preferences server itself though
2014-10-20T13:42:29 <Bosmon> As part of a grade that we add alongside the "kettle.use.CORS" grade
2014-10-20T13:44:29 <amilchev> Bosmon: yeah I\'ve modified that line just to surround the error
2014-10-20T13:46:40 <amilchev> Bosmon: just wanted to let you know about it
2014-10-20T13:48:33 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-10-20T13:48:47 <amilchev> kasparnet: yeah it\'s Antranig\'s branch that I\'m using https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-784/package.json#L14

2014-10-20T16:06:01 <anastasiac> yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely less overwhelming, jhung. Let\xe2\x80\x99s use that one. We can update later if someone says to.
2014-10-20T16:06:34 <jhung> Sounds good anastasiac.

2014-10-20T18:58:03 <anastasiac> yes, jhung, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve done the npm install to get stylus
2014-10-20T18:58:13 <anastasiac> do I have to run something specific before starting up docpad?
2014-10-20T18:58:39 <jhung> Did you run: docpad install stylus
