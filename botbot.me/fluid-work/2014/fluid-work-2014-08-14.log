2014-08-14T16:18:13 <kasparnet> simonjb: ^
2014-08-14T16:19:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m trying to run the tests across browsers but am having trouble with them in Safari and Chrome, did you see this?
2014-08-14T16:20:02 <simonjb> kasparnet: I can run that test now in my Win8 VM and let you know what I see
2014-08-14T16:20:12 <kasparnet> thanks a lot simonjb
2014-08-14T16:20:48 <simonjb> kasparnet: np, give me a little time to get set up and then I\'ll let you know what I see
2014-08-14T16:20:48 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-08-14T16:26:18 <cindyli> Justin_o: the same issue in safari and chrome with the master branch. we probably should file a separate jira for it. what do you think?
2014-08-14T16:27:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure.. would you mind to file jiras for those and I\'ll merge in your pull request.. i can take a look at those unit test issues afterwards too
2014-08-14T16:27:34 <cindyli> sure. thanks, Justin_o
2014-08-14T16:27:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-08-14T16:31:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: your first FLOE-160 pull request has been merged
2014-08-14T16:31:35 <cindyli> yay! thanks, Justin_o
2014-08-14T16:35:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: no problem.. could you please let me know the numbers for the new jiras you are filing
2014-08-14T16:36:23 <cindyli> Justin_o: the one for chrome is FLOE-218, in the middle of writing the safari one. will let you know once done.
2014-08-14T16:36:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks..
2014-08-14T16:36:50 <Justin_o> i was going to start with the chrome one anyways, so that\'s perfect
2014-08-14T16:40:11 <cindyli> cool. the one for safari is FLOE-219. I will add those into the floe planning wiki page too, Justin_o
2014-08-14T16:40:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-08-14T16:40:27 <cindyli> np
2014-08-14T16:44:31 <cindyli> justin, will you review the pull request for build.fluidproject.org too? https://github.com/fluid-project/build.fluidproject.org/pull/12
2014-08-14T16:48:31 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'ve made a first pass at adding IDs to the EPUB html: https://github.com/acheetham/EPUB/tree/FLOE-215  You might want to merge that into your branch before you make any more modifications, just to keep things in as close sync as possible
2014-08-14T16:48:39 <simonjb> kasparnet: I\'m seeing "Object doesn\'t support property or method \'getInstantiator\'" -- is that what you are seeing? (this is the first time I am running this test)
2014-08-14T16:49:24 <simonjb> kasparnet: for universal/gpii/node_modules/transformer/test/html/TransformerTests.html?testNumber=1
2014-08-14T16:50:39 <simonjb> kasparnet: in IE, loaded from filesystem
2014-08-14T16:51:00 <simonjb> kasparnet: so far I\'ve only been running acceptance tests and not web based
2014-08-14T16:51:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: apparently I didn\'t put up the right name in the last msg - will you review the pull request for http://build.fluidproject.org/\xc2\xa0too? https://github.com/fluid-project/build.fluidproject.org/pull/12
2014-08-14T16:52:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, i\'ll take a look at that one too.. the only issue is that the metadata repo hasn\'t been rebuilt on the build site yet
2014-08-14T16:53:59 <cindyli> right
2014-08-14T16:55:04 <kasparnet> simonjb: yeah - that\'s exactly the error I\'m seeing
2014-08-14T16:55:44 <kasparnet> cool - I hadn\'t run the code for about a month and wanted to make sure that it wasn\'t me doing something stupid :)
2014-08-14T16:55:49 <jhung> anastasiac:  thanks will do
2014-08-14T16:59:13 <kasparnet> simonjb: do all the other universal tests pass for you (ie. running: node tests/all-tests.js from universal folder)
2014-08-14T16:59:23 <kasparnet> ?*

2014-08-14T17:00:12 <kasparnet> for me
2014-08-14T17:02:17 <simonjb> kasparnet: "All tests concluded: 62/62 total passed in 11047ms - PASS"
2014-08-14T17:02:28 <kasparnet> damn
2014-08-14T17:02:29 <kasparnet> :)
2014-08-14T17:03:16 <kasparnet> thanks simonjb
2014-08-14T17:03:27 <simonjb> kasparnet: glad to help
2014-08-14T17:04:01 <simonjb> kasparnet: once we have the automated testing done and deployed to a public server, we\'ll have a dashboard to check on
2014-08-14T17:04:12 <simonjb> kasparnet: which will be awesome
2014-08-14T17:04:20 <kasparnet> yeah - I\'m really really looking forward to that
2014-08-14T17:04:41 <kasparnet> that\'ll ensure that things like the webbased test failures would get caught sooner
2014-08-14T17:04:45 <kasparnet> as well
2014-08-14T17:04:49 <kasparnet> it\'s gonna be great!!!

2014-08-14T17:05:35 <simonjb> kasparnet: I\'m focusing on the acceptance tests initially -- will tackle the web-base tests after those
2014-08-14T17:05:57 <kasparnet> unless I get to them first :D
2014-08-14T17:06:03 <simonjb> :)
2014-08-14T17:12:05 <cindyli> Justin_o: I noticed I didn\'t remove pouchDBDataSource.js from the metadata component js folder. I\'ve issued a pull request for it - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/34, can you review it?
2014-08-14T17:12:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. i\'ll take a look at that soon
2014-08-14T17:12:51 <cindyli> thanks and sorry, Justin_o

2014-08-14T17:32:19 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the EPUB html: You\'ve got aria attributes on <math> elements and that\'s not validating. I\'m wondering if we should use this approach? http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#math
2014-08-14T17:32:38 <anastasiac> wrap a div around the math element and put the aria on the div?
2014-08-14T17:33:42 <jhung> anastasiac: sounds good. I think most <math> blocks are already wrapped in divs or spans.
2014-08-14T17:34:12 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\'ll make those changes. I\'m running it through the validator to make sure my IDs are all good, so...
2014-08-14T17:35:01 <jhung> anastasiac: great! Thanks for doing that.
2014-08-14T17:35:05 <anastasiac> ah, yes, jhung, you did it this way in chapter 1, there are just a couple of differences in chapter 2

2014-08-14T11:40:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. i\'m looking at your comment on the FLOE-207 pull request
2014-08-14T11:40:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess i\'ll need to programmatically bind the model listeners.
2014-08-14T11:40:57 <Justin_o> can you tell me what the pathspec looks like https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/ChangeApplierAPI.md#programmatic-style
2014-08-14T11:42:18 <Justin_o> is it literally just an EL path?
2014-08-14T11:43:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - they\'re the same as those described as "simple string" in the section "Model Path References" at the head of the document
2014-08-14T11:43:19 <Bosmon> How do you get the anchor links btw, do you make them up by hand? : P
2014-08-14T11:43:25 <Bosmon> It would be nice to have a table of contents on these pages.....
2014-08-14T11:43:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you can just hover over the headers and an icon will appear to the left
2014-08-14T11:43:46 <Bosmon> aha!
2014-08-14T11:43:53 <Bosmon> very good
2014-08-14T11:44:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  we could probably do some auto construction of the ToC, maybe as the static pages are generated
2014-08-14T11:54:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'ve updated the FLOE-207 pull request. It\'s ready for another round of review. https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/33

2014-08-14T13:43:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks.. i wonder if we should do that in a new jira.
2014-08-14T13:43:57 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-08-14T13:43:57 <Justin_o> currently only one of the icons has a tooltip
2014-08-14T13:44:13 <anastasiac> why is that, Justin_o?
2014-08-14T13:44:31 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it\'s the only one that has been implemented with any functionality
2014-08-14T13:44:39 <Justin_o> we have separate jiras for each of the icons on the right
2014-08-14T13:44:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: did we make any jiras for the metadata icons in the feedback tool?
2014-08-14T13:45:07 <anastasiac> ah, ok. Let\'s add this topic to things to discuss at tomorrow\'s planning meeting.
2014-08-14T13:47:38 <anastasiac> good morning, jhung. Do you have a few minutes this morning for a check-in regarding the EPUB3 work?
2014-08-14T13:47:40 <Justin_o> sounds good
2014-08-14T13:48:29 <jhung> anastasiac: sure
2014-08-14T13:48:39 <jhung> in 10 mins anastasiac on skype?
2014-08-14T13:48:59 <anastasiac> sounds good, jhung. Ping me on skype when you\'re ready
2014-08-14T13:49:06 <jhung> sure
2014-08-14T13:59:49 <cindyli> Justin_o, anastasiac, we don\'t have jiras for metadata icons in the feedback tool. i think our first pass for the feedback demo is to implement the request icons at the right. yes, let\'s talk about this in tomorrow\'s meeting
2014-08-14T14:16:31 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i was looking into GPII-772 and left some comments there http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-772
2014-08-14T14:17:03 <Justin_o> I tried out atom-shell. While it runs in each of the OS\'s it doesn\'t seem to work with the screen readers.
2014-08-14T14:17:31 <Justin_o> I\'ve started a thread on the atom-shell discussion forum about it, so hopefully if I\'m missing something someone will let me know.
2014-08-14T14:24:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: i left another comment on your FLOE-160 pull request

2014-08-14T14:41:42 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding your EPUB github repo: Are we planning to move that to the fluid-project space?
2014-08-14T14:44:03 <jhung> anastasiac: yes eventually. Although we will need to find a better solution for hosting videos. We have a CDN, but we will need to talk to avtar about using that for the videos.
2014-08-14T14:44:37 <anastasiac> jhung, should I just fork your repo for now?
2014-08-14T14:45:34 <jhung> Go ahead\tanastasiac.

2014-08-14T15:02:47 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the media overlays for the epub content: I\'m wondering what granularity we should implement: sentence level? paragraph? This would affect both highlighting and navigation
2014-08-14T15:04:52 <jhung> anastasiac: I think we may do both depending on the content? But for our content I think we would likely go by paragraph.
2014-08-14T15:05:06 <jhung> (Some paragraphs are a single sentence)

2014-08-14T15:05:40 <anastasiac> jhung, paraphraphs was my first thought, but then I wondered\xe2\x80\xa6 since this is technical content, I wonder if sentence level might be more helpful?
2014-08-14T15:05:46 <anastasiac> I\'ll start with paragraph
2014-08-14T15:05:55 <anastasiac> I can add sentence level later if we decide
2014-08-14T15:06:15 <jhung> Yes. I think we may end up mixing both approaches anastasiac/

2014-08-14T16:09:54 <kasparnet> Bosmon: have you per chance tried running the web-based tests of universal/master recently
2014-08-14T16:10:04 <kasparnet> they seem to be failing me both on windows and mac
2014-08-14T16:10:29 <kasparnet> and in windows at least, I\'m sure it\'s not a question of node_modules being found further up the directory path
