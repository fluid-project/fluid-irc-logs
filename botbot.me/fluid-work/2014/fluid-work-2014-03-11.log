b'2014-03-11T19:27:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just a grade name that has no other implementation
2014-03-11T19:27:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i see
2014-03-11T19:28:04 <Bosmon> grade names are free these days anyway... and you can then take care to qualify it properly
2014-03-11T19:28:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll leave that as an option.. i guess for now it\'s probably not necessary...
2014-03-11T19:28:32 <Bosmon> member names aren\'t really meant to be used as context names except in special situations - in fact, in situations which are the opposite of the one you have now
2014-03-11T19:28:50 <Justin_o> the opposite?
2014-03-11T19:28:51 <Bosmon> That is, situations in which you have several different members for which all the other context names are the SAME but they differ only in member name
2014-03-11T19:30:04 <Justin_o> oh okay
2014-03-11T19:30:06 <Bosmon> for example if you had two "inputs", myInput1, and myInput2, which had the same kinds of component in them
2014-03-11T19:30:11 <Bosmon> You could distinguish them by the member name
2014-03-11T19:30:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes sense
2014-03-11T19:30:45 <Bosmon> But this is only something that the component implementor would do themselves, since the names are so short, they are not safe to use as more global contexts in a wider community
2014-03-11T19:30:51 <Bosmon> It\'s similar to the rules on having variable names
2014-03-11T19:31:03 <Bosmon> You would use short names for local variables, and longer names for those advertised in a wider context
2014-03-11T19:31:24 * msasar joined the channel
2014-03-11T19:31:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. that seems reasonable.. i wonder how good we are at keeping those rules.. perhaps we\'ve been doing them implicitly :)

2014-03-11T19:56:32 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon
2014-03-11T19:57:57 <Bosmon> Hi again cindyli :)
2014-03-11T19:58:48 <cindyli> yes, again. i have a component that has these options: 1. modelRelay block; 2. an onCreate listener to set the initial model
2014-03-11T19:59:07 <cindyli> i noticed the modelRelay part always runs before the onCreate listener
2014-03-11T19:59:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s correct
2014-03-11T19:59:23 <Bosmon> You must never use an onCreate listener to set the initial model :)
2014-03-11T19:59:27 <cindyli> how can i have the initial model set first?
2014-03-11T19:59:35 <cindyli> ah, why not?
2014-03-11T19:59:39 <Bosmon> You must use an expander or some other kind of direct reference
2014-03-11T19:59:43 <Bosmon> Because onCreate is far too late
2014-03-11T19:59:50 <cindyli> direct reference?
2014-03-11T19:59:54 <Bosmon> In fact in the end we will start to deprecate onCreate too : P
2014-03-11T19:59:58 <Bosmon> As the VERY LAST of our lifecycle points
2014-03-11T20:00:01 <Bosmon> We got rid of all the others
2014-03-11T20:00:07 <cindyli> like {anotherCmoponent}.model
2014-03-11T20:00:09 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-03-11T20:00:28 <Bosmon> ALL LIFECYCLE POINTS MUST DIE
2014-03-11T20:00:40 <cindyli> oh, nooooooo
2014-03-11T20:00:54 <Bosmon> Although I suspect onCreate will be very stubborn
2014-03-11T20:01:39 <Bosmon> Still, the vast majority of things we currently put in onCreate will go away soon
2014-03-11T20:01:45 <Bosmon> As part of the "new renderer decorator system"
2014-03-11T20:01:50 <cindyli> to where?
2014-03-11T20:02:21 <cindyli> i mean the things that will be removed from onCreate
2014-03-11T20:02:49 <Bosmon> I just have a "sketch implementation" now
2014-03-11T20:02:52 <Bosmon> But here is an example: http://pastie.org/8894911#19
2014-03-11T20:03:22 <Bosmon> It\'s somewhat similar to the old "renderer decorator" system only it is not just for parrotts
2014-03-11T20:03:41 <Bosmon> That is, it doesn\'t commit you to a particular rendering technology....
2014-03-11T20:04:28 <Bosmon> Anyway, yes, in the "new model system" the entire model skeleton for the whole component tree will generally be resolved even before the first onCreate fires anywhere
2014-03-11T20:04:39 <Bosmon> And in general "onCreate" is going to get later and later
2014-03-11T20:04:48 <cindyli> that would be cool
2014-03-11T20:04:54 <Bosmon> You should be very suspicious of putting anything in there
2014-03-11T20:05:08 <cindyli> decorators are back on the play
2014-03-11T20:05:11 <Bosmon> In general "onCreate" will become only relevant to external observers of the component
2014-03-11T20:05:18 <Bosmon> And will cease to be a useful technique for implementors
2014-03-11T20:05:34 <Bosmon> That is, the only purpose of "onCreate" is to notify someone outside the component that it is now completely ready
2014-03-11T20:06:03 <cindyli> will try. i guess may not be easy. since finalInit is gone, i was largely depending on onCreate ;)
2014-03-11T20:06:28 <Bosmon> :)
2014-03-11T20:07:26 <cindyli> "dependent" might be a better word than "depending"
2014-03-11T20:08:18 <Bosmon> Where does it say "depending"?
2014-03-11T20:08:35 <cindyli> "i was largely depending on onCreate". :)
2014-03-11T20:08:44 <Bosmon> I think your usage was correct
2014-03-11T20:08:53 <cindyli> nice.
2014-03-11T20:08:53 <Bosmon> People are depending, components are dependent : P
2014-03-11T20:09:03 <cindyli> make sense :)

2014-03-11T17:32:53 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2014-03-11T17:33:09 <Bosmon> Hi, cindyli!
2014-03-11T17:33:41 * Niharika has left the channel
2014-03-11T17:35:26 <cindyli> Bosmon: in the metadata demo, there\'s a top panel component with a central model containing three sub-panel components. all of them are view or renderer relay components and models of sub-panel components are relayed from the top central model.
2014-03-11T17:36:23 <cindyli> in the top component, there\'s a model listener listening to the single change and save the model into a database.
2014-03-11T17:38:17 <cindyli> this listener is triggered many times at instantiation or every single model change on the subpanels. this is causing problem with saving
2014-03-11T17:39:57 <cindyli> the saving actually only needs to happen when all relays are settled and top central model is finalized. i wonder if there\'s a way to listen to this state?
2014-03-11T17:41:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - can you be explicit about all the times you want the model saved?
2014-03-11T17:43:20 <cindyli> Bosmon: the model needs to be saved when there\'s a change in this model
2014-03-11T17:47:13 <cindyli> for example, when sub1 model is changed, the change is relayed to the top. the top model needs to be saved. however, at this point, the model change at the top model triggers the relay to sub2 and sub3 and be bounced back to to the top again. but there\'s actually no changes in the two subsequent relays, Bosmon
2014-03-11T17:47:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - I suspect there must be an "old-style" component in the mix somewhere
2014-03-11T17:47:51 <cindyli> checking...
2014-03-11T17:47:52 <Bosmon> Since the purpose of the new implementation is to supply just one notification on an entire series of relays
2014-03-11T17:48:09 <cindyli> ah ha. good to know
2014-03-11T17:48:20 <cindyli> and that\'s exactly what i want
2014-03-11T17:48:26 <Bosmon> You should never be receiving i) "null changes" or ii) "multiply relayed changes"
2014-03-11T17:48:29 * anastasiac has quit
2014-03-11T17:48:36 <Bosmon> The entire set of relays across the component tree should operate as a single transaction

2014-03-11T18:17:07 <Bosmon> How does "the model change at the top model" actually work?
2014-03-11T18:18:59 <cindyli> no, Bosmon, the whole system only has one fluid.viewComponent that doesn\'t reflect any change to top. it is tooltip coming from the framework. does it need to be an view relay component?
2014-03-11T18:19:28 <cindyli> i\'m trying with a unit test that only contains the necessary structure
2014-03-11T18:19:36 <Bosmon> tooltip should be harmless.... surely it isn\'t triggering any changes?
2014-03-11T18:19:41 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli
2014-03-11T18:20:24 <cindyli> tooltiop? no, it only receives changes without triggering any changes back

2014-03-11T18:49:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'ve created a unit test in which the back-and-forth bouncing seems happening: http://pastie.org/8908396
2014-03-11T18:50:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: let me know if anything I\'m doing wrong in this unit test
2014-03-11T18:51:05 <cindyli> otherwise i can file a jira with this unit test
2014-03-11T19:08:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - I believe the issue is that you are listening to changes with the style "*"
2014-03-11T19:08:37 <Bosmon> Whereas you should be using ""
2014-03-11T19:09:00 <cindyli> ah\xe2\x80\xa6.. trying
2014-03-11T19:09:38 <cindyli> you are my HERO, Bosmon
2014-03-11T19:09:46 <cindyli> closing jira and the pull
2014-03-11T19:09:59 <Bosmon> I would have been rather more worth being a hero if I had actually produced documentation on this so far :)
2014-03-11T19:10:04 <Bosmon> But I am writing it now....
2014-03-11T19:10:49 <cindyli> :) :) btw, when should the star be used and when should the empty string, Bosmon?
2014-03-11T19:11:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - "*" is currently only supported as the final path segment of a matching path, and it means, "report all changes to segments ONE path segment below this level as separate changes"
2014-03-11T19:11:46 <Bosmon> A path which does not end with "*" means "report all changes below this path level as a single change"
2014-03-11T19:12:18 <Bosmon> So a listener which wants to respond to ALL changes to the model anywhere as a single change should use the path ""
2014-03-11T19:12:37 <cindyli> ha, big difference. thanks, Bosmon. helpful as always

2014-03-11T19:13:27 <Bosmon> Note that, for example, a path of "*" would still report changes to "root1.sub1" and "root1.sub2" as a single change - the rule applies only to the immediately following path segment
2014-03-11T19:13:43 <Bosmon> Changes to "root1.sub1" and "root2.sub1" would be reported as two changes
2014-03-11T19:14:01 <Bosmon> "*" is used for path locations which you could say correspond to separate "entities" in your design

2014-03-11T19:20:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i want to use distribute options to send configuration to dynamic components do i have to use their type
2014-03-11T19:20:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can use any context which matches
2014-03-11T19:20:56 <Bosmon> Just as with the contexts which you use in standard {} expressions
2014-03-11T19:21:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i wanted to use the member name which was used in the dynamicComponents block but it seemed to only match the first
2014-03-11T19:21:58 <Bosmon> the first?
2014-03-11T19:22:34 <Justin_o> So i have a dynamic component set up like this
2014-03-11T19:22:37 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/68ImrfIv
2014-03-11T19:23:02 <Bosmon> oh yes
2014-03-11T19:23:04 <Bosmon> That\'s correct
2014-03-11T19:23:11 <Bosmon> Each dynamic component will be assigned a different member name
2014-03-11T19:23:16 <Bosmon> Clearly they can\'t all be assigned the same one : P
2014-03-11T19:23:28 <Bosmon> You had better give your components a proper grade of some kind
2014-03-11T19:23:55 <Bosmon> What\'s wrong with using the context "resourceInput" ?
2014-03-11T19:24:05 * calcium has quit
2014-03-11T19:25:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes that works, but if someone wanted to reconfigure the component to use a different type for the input they would have to change it in both the dynamicComponent and the distributeOptions
2014-03-11T19:25:23 <Justin_o> so i was hoping to avoid this
2014-03-11T19:25:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - unfortunately agreement on context names is something that all integrators need to collaborate on
2014-03-11T19:26:16 <Bosmon> If necessary you can just come up with a "tag" context name that you and every implementor should use
2014-03-11T19:26:32 <Bosmon> And advertise this fact in your documentation :)
2014-03-11T19:27:15 <Bosmon> "input" would be far too dangerous a context name to use in any case
2014-03-11T19:27:16 <Justin_o> what is a "tag" context name
2014-03-11T19:27:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i think so
