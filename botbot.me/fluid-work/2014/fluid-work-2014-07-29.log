b'2014-07-29T16:34:21 <Bosmon8> colinclark - yes
2014-07-29T16:34:45 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - so, for example, the manual test instructions will have more detail than the instructions for users
2014-07-29T16:34:58 <Bosmon8> For example, users are directed to fill in "as much metadata as possible"
2014-07-29T16:35:09 <Bosmon8> Whereas the tester will be told to operate particular controls and observe particular effects
2014-07-29T16:38:02 <Bosmon8> For example on the "audio panel" one should observe the action of the radio buttons in enabling and disabling panels etc.
2014-07-29T16:38:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon8, colinclark: maybe a concrete example would help.. I\'m just thinking that for basic acceptance testing you\'d want them to do very similar things.. if you want the whole manual test plan in there.. that\'s a different story
2014-07-29T16:38:33 * slim_ joined the channel
2014-07-29T16:38:35 <colinclark> Justin_o: you review a lot of pull requests for various code, right?
2014-07-29T16:38:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2014-07-29T16:39:08 <colinclark> So how do you know, given a particular pull request, what to do to make sure it\'s working?
2014-07-29T16:39:31 <Justin_o> well i hope there are unit tests :)
2014-07-29T16:39:52 <colinclark> But in addition to unit tests, do you do any manual testing usually?
2014-07-29T16:40:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes.. but usually the jira should convey what the change was.
2014-07-29T16:40:45 <colinclark> Okay, and do you test to make sure that things seem like they\'re working? That there isn\'t a regression of some notable functionality, that kind of thing?
2014-07-29T16:41:07 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon8: i think what you are getting at though is really more inline with the whole manual test plan for a give component.. of which i\'m not necessarily opposed to moving this into a md file that accompanies the component.. it would be more likely that they\'ll stay up to date.
2014-07-29T16:41:21 <colinclark> I wasn\'t quite getting at that, no
2014-07-29T16:41:44 <Justin_o> colinclark:  but how would you know unless you have details about all of the functionality that you\'d expect to work
2014-07-29T16:41:48 <Bosmon8> I think it should be up to the "discretion" of the implementor what to include, but where the code implements some kind of "major interaction", this should be explained in the instructions
2014-07-29T16:42:08 <colinclark> I was asking my questions to you for a reason, Justin_o
2014-07-29T16:42:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: but the major interaction is what a user would want to do to
2014-07-29T16:42:12 <Justin_o> too
2014-07-29T16:42:13 <colinclark> and it wasn\'t to lead you to a conclusion
2014-07-29T16:42:18 <Bosmon8> For example, "when the user clicks on the "no audio" radio button, the checkboxes accompanying this should be hidden"
2014-07-29T16:42:27 <colinclark> it was to \x08explore some concrete examples of review practice
2014-07-29T16:42:28 <Bosmon8> Or "when the user clicks outside the dialog box, it should dismiss"
2014-07-29T16:42:45 <colinclark> I suspect that most reviewers don\'t, when they review a pull request, run the entire manual test plan
2014-07-29T16:42:51 <colinclark> but they probably do go through and "try some stuff"
2014-07-29T16:43:47 <colinclark> My impression of Bosmon8\'s idea was that it was intended to cover roughly what "try some stuff" consists of for a particular component
2014-07-29T16:44:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure.. i doubt that it happens very often / ever, but it would give the full details on what should be expected.
2014-07-29T16:45:03 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon8: i guess i still don\'t fully understand how "try some stuff" differs from what a user would want to also try out.
2014-07-29T16:45:34 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - it differs from the perspective of the information
2014-07-29T16:45:40 <Bosmon8> A user wants to know what something does for them
2014-07-29T16:45:48 <Bosmon8> A reviewer wants to know what might go wrong
2014-07-29T16:45:49 <Justin_o> from what i\'m seeing here, it is describing more detail about specific actions and results.. but that sounds a lot more like the manual test plans.
2014-07-29T16:46:25 <Justin_o> i guess i don\'t want to have to write the test plans in two spots if it can be avoided.
2014-07-29T16:52:09 <Bosmon8> Ok
2014-07-29T16:52:18 <Bosmon8> Where should the manual tests plans for a component be kept?
2014-07-29T16:54:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: that\'s a good question.. and could be mistake in my reasoning..
2014-07-29T16:54:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: so it could live with the component.. integrations of components would have it live with the integration
2014-07-29T16:54:42 <Justin_o> if that makes sense..
2014-07-29T16:55:01 <Justin_o> but i wonder if this is getting to messy :(
2014-07-29T16:56:01 <Bosmon8> I think having it live with the component or integration is a good idea

2014-07-29T16:59:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: okay..
2014-07-29T17:01:11 <colinclark> Manual test plans currently are the wiki?
2014-07-29T17:01:18 <colinclark> That\'s not a sufficient location, Bosmon8?
2014-07-29T17:01:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, in the wiki... although there may not be anything yet for metadata and feedback..

2014-07-29T17:17:26 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark, Justin_o, if a manual test wiki page sounds good, i can start writing it. Since this wiki page is usually used by testers, it\'s probably ok not to have its link on the demo page. what do you think?
2014-07-29T17:19:20 <cindyli> michelled, Justin_o, Bosmon, your comments on the pull request for FLOE-194 (https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/28) have been addressed and ready for another look.
2014-07-29T17:23:32 <Bosmon8> colinclark, Justin_o - if the test plans are in the wiki, I would prefer to see a link to that wiki page from some file in the component\'s code
2014-07-29T17:23:56 <Justin_o> could it be in a comment somewhere?
2014-07-29T17:25:06 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - sure
2014-07-29T17:25:23 <Bosmon8> cindyli - for FLOE-194 - is the button not part of the dialog?
2014-07-29T17:25:52 <cindyli> Bosmon8, no, it\'s not, the click on the button triggers the creation of the dialog
2014-07-29T17:25:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon8, cindyli, colinclark: what about as a comment in the html file for the demo?
2014-07-29T17:26:05 <cindyli> demos/index.html
2014-07-29T17:26:13 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - that seems like a place someone would be very unlikely to look
2014-07-29T17:26:18 <Bosmon8> I\'d suggest a separate file
2014-07-29T17:26:27 <Bosmon8> Or a code comment
2014-07-29T17:26:28 <cindyli> demos/index.md
2014-07-29T17:27:00 <Bosmon8> cindyli - ok, so I guess just including the dialog and the button to globalDismissal should be sufficient
2014-07-29T17:27:08 <Bosmon8> The descendant test will be performed automatically
2014-07-29T17:27:17 <cindyli> ah, cool. will try
2014-07-29T17:28:54 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon8: how about a comment in the demo\'s js file?
2014-07-29T17:29:31 <Justin_o> ah.. i guess it might be confusing for metadata since there are many js files, and for feedback there isn\'t any at all yet

2014-07-29T18:02:24 <cindyli> Bosmon8 and Justin_o, an index.md that contains the link to the manual tests wiki page?
2014-07-29T18:03:40 <michelled> Bosmon: this seems like a generally useful thing to know - should it be added to the docs somewhere? "The "relay" grades should be used in all new code. The plain "non-relay" grades will be eliminated from the framework as soon as we can get around to it - basically as soon as we can migrate the preferences framework over to the relay grades."
2014-07-29T18:04:55 <Bosmon8> michelled - I thought it was well enough known : P
2014-07-29T18:05:05 <Bosmon8> Surely I can find somewhere that says so ...............
2014-07-29T18:05:10 <Bosmon8> cindyli - very good
2014-07-29T18:05:24 <cindyli> ok
2014-07-29T18:06:31 <Bosmon8> michelled - our http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Component+Grades essentially says this
2014-07-29T18:06:38 <Bosmon8> Although I guess it could be expressed more forcefully
2014-07-29T18:07:02 <michelled> was this page not deemed worthy of the github space?
2014-07-29T18:07:14 <Bosmon8> Oh, I\'m sure it is there
2014-07-29T18:07:20 <Bosmon8> Just this one still ranks higher in Google : P
2014-07-29T18:07:57 <michelled> ah, yes, it\'s there
2014-07-29T18:08:38 <michelled> Justin_o: I wonder if at the next doc sprint it\'s time to put clear and strong redirection notices from the old docs to the github docs
2014-07-29T18:08:54 <Bosmon8> michelled - perhaps even more forcefully, to delete them :)
2014-07-29T18:09:07 <Bosmon8> Or rather, to delete them and replace them with the redirection notices
2014-07-29T18:09:18 <michelled> yes, that\'s a better idea
2014-07-29T18:11:09 <Justin_o> michelled: do you know how to do that in the wiki?
2014-07-29T18:11:32 <Justin_o> michelled: when you say redirections do you just mean a link in the wiki page.. or an http redirect?
2014-07-29T18:11:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: are our "QA test plan"s essentially the manual test plans? such as http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Uploader+QA+Test+Plan?
2014-07-29T18:12:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes

2014-07-29T15:23:40 <kasparnet> colinclark, avtar, jhernandez, slim_, the-t-in-rtf: Ok - seems to be working again now .. it was an issue with the hidden email thing
2014-07-29T15:23:45 <kasparnet> https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Mentions+are+Not+Working+in+JIRA
2014-07-29T15:23:57 <kasparnet> I\'ve now set it to only show emails to logged in users
2014-07-29T15:24:09 <avtar> thanks, kasparnet
2014-07-29T15:24:20 <slim_> tvm
2014-07-29T15:24:29 <kasparnet> which is the most \'hidden\' mode that will work (I guess "masked" is an alternative - but I imagine that\'s more likely to be harvested)
2014-07-29T15:24:54 <colinclark> thanks, kasparnet
2014-07-29T15:24:56 <colinclark> you rule
2014-07-29T15:25:44 <colinclark> hey kasparnet
2014-07-29T15:25:56 <colinclark> Bosmon was just saying that he never received any emails from the committers list
2014-07-29T15:26:05 <colinclark> except from your initial proposals
2014-07-29T15:26:09 <colinclark> so perhaps I misconfigured it?
2014-07-29T15:26:23 <colinclark> I sent a couple of emails but I\'m not sure anyone received them
2014-07-29T15:27:02 <kasparnet> colinclark: I received 2 emails from you, along with my own mails
2014-07-29T15:27:12 <colinclark> did you receive them from the list?
2014-07-29T15:27:17 <colinclark> or because they were addressed to you?
2014-07-29T15:28:23 <kasparnet> perhaps adressed to me (I\'m "To" and list is "CC")
2014-07-29T15:28:28 <kasparnet> colinclark: ^
2014-07-29T15:28:30 <colinclark> yes
2014-07-29T15:28:40 <colinclark> I embarrassingly can\'t find my password for that list now :P
2014-07-29T15:28:47 <colinclark> let me have a look
2014-07-29T15:29:10 <colinclark> ah, got it
2014-07-29T15:30:15 <colinclark> damn, none of my configuration changes seemed to have been saved
2014-07-29T15:30:26 <colinclark> Why don\'t web apps always just save stuff you type?
2014-07-29T15:31:20 * the-t-in-rtf1 joined the channel
2014-07-29T15:31:20 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-07-29T15:32:14 <avtar> colinclark: you saved your changes and they reverted back to defaults?
2014-07-29T15:32:31 <colinclark> avtar: I think my point is that I didn\'t press the save button
2014-07-29T15:32:35 <colinclark> sssssshhh ;)
2014-07-29T15:32:38 <avtar> ah ok
2014-07-29T15:32:40 <avtar> as you were
2014-07-29T15:35:42 <colinclark> Okay, so I made a few tweaks to the configuration, kasparnet
2014-07-29T15:35:50 <colinclark> and the archives seemed to receive my message
2014-07-29T15:36:02 <colinclark> let me see if Bosmon was subscribed using the correct email address
2014-07-29T15:36:38 <kasparnet> colinclark: ok - I just looked through the admin pages as well, and didn\'t see anything that looked wrong
2014-07-29T15:37:01 <colinclark> Bosmon\'s email address is wrong--my bad
2014-07-29T15:37:09 <colinclark> I mistook him for a .co instead of a .org
2014-07-29T15:38:17 <kasparnet> ok cool! did you send a test mail to the list without my name explicitly mentioned?
2014-07-29T15:38:22 <kasparnet> or email, I guess
2014-07-29T15:43:49 * michelled has quit
2014-07-29T15:43:49 <colinclark> No, but if the archives received the email, then the rest of the list should be as well
2014-07-29T15:44:06 <colinclark> hey yzen, can I bug you for a super quick question?
2014-07-29T15:44:14 <yzen> colinclark for sure :)
2014-07-29T15:44:33 <yzen> colinclark hi
2014-07-29T15:44:37 <colinclark> hiya
2014-07-29T15:44:41 <colinclark> how\'s it going? :)
2014-07-29T15:44:54 <colinclark> yzen: My quick question: did you receive, on the gpii-committers email list, a) the email from kasper nominating some folks and b) my responses to those emails?
2014-07-29T15:45:04 <colinclark> we\'re having some mailing list dorkiness
2014-07-29T15:45:15 <colinclark> and you\'re the only other committer who is around at the moment :)
2014-07-29T15:45:54 <yzen> colinclark yes for Justin
2014-07-29T15:45:59 <colinclark> great
2014-07-29T15:46:08 <colinclark> kasparnet: Okay, so the list is working :)
2014-07-29T15:46:18 <kasparnet> yay colinclark
2014-07-29T15:46:23 <colinclark> it was just my bad about getting Bosmon\'s email address wrong
2014-07-29T15:46:31 <colinclark> thanks yzen
2014-07-29T15:46:48 <yzen> but funny enough, an email from your colinclark shows up as suspecious
2014-07-29T15:46:54 <colinclark> wow
2014-07-29T15:46:58 <colinclark> I always knew it
2014-07-29T15:48:14 <colinclark> this seems like a good opportunity for Elvis

2014-07-29T16:02:44 <Bosmon8> cindyli, Justin_o, anastasiac - so I think we are at the final stages for cindyli\'s pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/25/files
2014-07-29T16:02:56 <Bosmon8> There is an odd final issue relating to how we provide instructions for those things we call "demos"
2014-07-29T16:03:26 <Bosmon8> So, since we have abolished most of them, the things called "demos" are also in practice the things which fulfil the role which used to be handled by "manual tests"
2014-07-29T16:03:28 * jhernandez has quit
2014-07-29T16:04:14 <Bosmon8> Whilst we would like all of the functionality of a component to be covered by automated tests, of course in practice there can be no substitute for the reviewer actually trying the component itself.... in practice by using its "demo"
2014-07-29T16:04:40 <Bosmon8> So, we have a place in our presentation of demos for instructions which are directed towards potential users of the component - via the "overview panel"
2014-07-29T16:04:59 <Bosmon8> These cover some, but not all, of the requirements of instructions which are aimed at testers
2014-07-29T16:05:13 * slim_ has quit
2014-07-29T16:05:22 <Bosmon8> One possibility for providing "manual test instructions" is as part of a .md file accompanying the demo directory
2014-07-29T16:05:24 <Bosmon8> What do you think?
2014-07-29T16:06:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: how different are the instructions for the manual test versus what\'s in the overview panel?
2014-07-29T16:18:58 * Jess_ has quit
2014-07-29T16:20:35 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think the idea is that these instructions would contain manual testing procedures
2014-07-29T16:20:43 <colinclark> i.e. for an audience of "us"
2014-07-29T16:21:05 <colinclark> whereas the overview panel is intended to give prospective users an overview of what a demo is and what it shows
2014-07-29T16:21:15 <colinclark> Does that distinction seem sensible?
