2014-05-28T14:07:52 <simonjb> anastasiac: https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-partials might be of interest
2014-05-28T14:09:11 <anastasiac> thanks, simonjb, I was looking at that yesterday. It mighthelp, though in my opinion, it's not ideal. It allows you to combine content from multiple files into a single output file. That would work, but I think the workflow would be easier if all the desired content was actually in the same source file. But it's better than nothing :-)

2014-05-28T14:54:14 <Justin_o> kasparne_: also i'm not sure how to set the break point..
2014-05-28T14:54:46 <Justin_o> kasparne_: and i added more info on how to reproduce the issue

2014-05-28T15:09:33 <Justin_o> kasparnet: also there are some minor changes needed for chris's pull request. basically he has some unneeded configuration. The fix seems to work though.. other than the logout button issue that amilchev is looking at.

2014-05-28T16:01:14 <kasparnet> for manual login: http://127.0.0.1:8081/user/<TOKEN>/login (and /logout)
2014-05-28T16:03:41 <kasparnet> yeah - the breakpoints is pretty tricky in node
2014-05-28T16:04:10 <kasparnet> basically you need to install node-inspector (npm install -g node-inspector)
2014-05-28T16:04:58 <kasparnet> then run the system from windows folder: node --debug gpii.js
2014-05-28T16:05:10 <kasparnet> and finally, in a different console, do a: node-inspector
2014-05-28T16:05:35 <kasparnet> once this is done, it should be possible to open the debugger in google chrome using the provided URL

2014-05-28T16:29:48 <Justin_o> kasparnet: okay.. i'll try those out

2014-05-28T16:34:56 <Justin_o> avtar: we have a jira to change the structure of infusion repo around. http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5217
2014-05-28T16:36:13 <Justin_o> avtar: wondering how much of a pain it will be for build.fluidproject.org if things change much.. i could do the change where nothing gets affected as the built output may still be the same.
2014-05-28T16:38:42 <avtar> i'll have to take a look but off the top of my head i think url rewriting will be required if existing urls need to be preserved
2014-05-28T16:40:13 <avtar> that might actually be the only extra bit of work
2014-05-28T16:46:27 <Justin_o> avtar: okay thanks
2014-05-28T16:47:04 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i tried the debugging... i got node-inspector installed, however launching gpii.js directly must not have included something as NVDA doesn't launch anymore
2014-05-28T17:05:28 <kasparnet> Justin_o: hmm.. that's odd.. and it's not because you're stuck at a breakpoint (sorry for the dumb question)?
