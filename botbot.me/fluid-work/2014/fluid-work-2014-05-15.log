2014-05-15T19:26:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should i be moving over the renderer docs?
2014-05-15T19:26:12 <Justin_o> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Renderer
2014-05-15T19:26:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i wasn\'t quite sure from your comments on the documentation planning page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation+Plan
2014-05-15T19:30:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I think we may as well move them over
2014-05-15T19:31:03 <Bosmon> We\'ll be struggling with the old renderer for a while longer
2014-05-15T19:32:34 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-05-15T19:35:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay..so i should move over all those linked pages too then
2014-05-15T19:35:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for example this one http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/How+To+Use+The+Renderer
2014-05-15T19:37:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess that one is still accurate, yes
2014-05-15T19:37:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks

2014-05-15T19:47:18 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - since adding model listeners procedurally isn\'t really supported any more, I needed to adjust your test case a bit -
2014-05-15T19:47:28 <Bosmon> In this form, they will pass: http://piratepad.net/8kvLgGGQEh
2014-05-15T19:47:59 <Bosmon> The "priority" field needs to be added as part of the spec structure, and this utility applied to encode it....
2014-05-15T19:48:08 <Bosmon> If you add the listener declaratively it should work in the usual way
2014-05-15T19:53:30 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon, it WORKS!
2014-05-15T19:54:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - there will be some irregularities with the current relay system but it should hopefully be good enough for you to express your implementation and test cases....
2014-05-15T19:54:33 <Bosmon> I\'ve written up the remaining issues as http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5373 after a chat with colinclark this morning but hopefully we can push this out until after the release
2014-05-15T19:54:43 <colinclark> WOAH
2014-05-15T19:54:46 <colinclark> WOW
2014-05-15T19:55:04 <colinclark> cindyli: All your tests pass?
2014-05-15T19:55:10 <Bosmon> In general you should expect to get some redundant notifications to model listeners in some cases but you should at least now expect them to be in the correct order and actually reflect the current condition of the model
2014-05-15T19:55:11 <cindyli> Yes. super!!
2014-05-15T19:55:21 <colinclark> Does this mean we might be able to...
2014-05-15T19:55:23 <colinclark> get ready for it...
2014-05-15T19:55:24 <colinclark> SHIP IT?
2014-05-15T19:55:27 <Bosmon> urgh
2014-05-15T19:55:39 <Bosmon> I want to SHIPP myself back to BEDD : P
2014-05-15T19:55:50 <colinclark> As you most definitely should, Doctor Bosmon
2014-05-15T19:56:37 <cindyli> certainly. go to bed. see you tomorrow, Bosmon

b'2014-05-15T15:36:20 <clown> so, I can use this for the jshint command line:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/.jshintrc ?
2014-05-15T15:36:30 <clown> colinclark ^
2014-05-15T15:36:49 <colinclark> yes
2014-05-15T15:36:56 <clown> cool.
2014-05-15T15:37:01 <colinclark> What I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest is that you include this jshintrc file with your pull reques
2014-05-15T15:37:03 <colinclark> t
2014-05-15T15:37:07 <clown> thanks.  That\'s what I will do then.
2014-05-15T15:37:16 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, maybe we should place that .jshintrc file into our linux repo and then run jshint
2014-05-15T15:37:23 * vjoanna has quit
2014-05-15T15:37:29 <colinclark> I believe if you install jshint with the -g option, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a command you can run
2014-05-15T15:37:43 <colinclark> and once we get Steve\xe2\x80\x99s Grunt scripts in, we\xe2\x80\x99ll include a JSHint task in them
2014-05-15T15:37:57 <clown> colinclark:  thanks.  I figured that out about 10 minutes ago:  (how to install jshint globally).
2014-05-15T15:38:06 <colinclark> sweet
2014-05-15T15:38:14 <clown> I\'m guessing we want to put the .jshintrc right at the top of the linux tree.
2014-05-15T15:38:20 <colinclark> yes
2014-05-15T15:38:31 <clown> I assume there is a way to tell jshint "use this jshintrc file".
2014-05-15T15:38:49 <clown> since the file I\'m linting is not in the root directory. oh \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s simple.
2014-05-15T15:38:57 <clown> just give the full path\xe2\x80\xa6  d\'oh!

2014-05-15T15:39:06 <colinclark> http://www.jshint.com/docs/
2014-05-15T15:39:10 <colinclark> yup
2014-05-15T15:39:58 <colinclark> it claims that it will actually climb the directory tree looking for its config file
2014-05-15T15:40:04 <clown> I think we need to add globals for "require" and other possible objects you get for free when you run node.
2014-05-15T15:40:14 <clown> smart jshint.
2014-05-15T15:41:40 <jhernandez> heh
2014-05-15T15:42:09 <jhernandez> jshint node_modules/packagekit/nodepackagekit/findSearchPk.js returned 58 errors
2014-05-15T15:42:39 <colinclark> :)
2014-05-15T15:42:53 <colinclark> For Flocking, I have a Git precommit hook set to run JSHint
2014-05-15T15:43:07 <colinclark> so my attempts to even commit code will fail if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass
2014-05-15T15:43:10 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'m down to 32 errors.

2014-05-15T16:15:06 <jhernandez> just seen your mail, and I was wondering if I were a little bit rude
2014-05-15T16:40:21 <clown> jhernandez:  done \xe2\x80\x94 I\'ve sent you a pull request.

2014-05-15T16:43:03 <jhernandez> clown: just a question
2014-05-15T16:43:11 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-05-15T16:44:56 <jhernandez> is the adding of the .jshintrc file a purpose?
2014-05-15T16:47:17 <clown> yes.
2014-05-15T16:47:36 <clown> I thought that\'s one of the things colinclark suggested.
2014-05-15T16:47:40 * clown reads the log.
2014-05-15T16:48:14 <clown> "clown:  I\'m guessing we want to put the .jshintrc right at the top of the linux tree."
2014-05-15T16:48:14 <clown> colinclark: yes"
2014-05-15T16:48:14 <colinclark> yes I did
2014-05-15T16:48:17 <colinclark> and a good idea :)
2014-05-15T16:48:33 <colinclark> all our repositories should have them
2014-05-15T16:48:37 <clown> if you do say so yourself...
2014-05-15T16:48:42 <colinclark> along with hot grunt scripts that run jshint automatically :)
2014-05-15T16:48:44 <colinclark> clown: lol
2014-05-15T16:49:03 <clown> yes, but I\'m not doing the grunt scripts.
2014-05-15T16:49:06 <clown> at least not now.
2014-05-15T16:49:09 * jhernandez looks if Steve\'s pull request is also including that file
2014-05-15T16:49:12 <clown> something for the future.
2014-05-15T16:49:17 <clown> jhernandez:   good idea.
2014-05-15T16:49:37 <jhernandez> it is not
2014-05-15T16:49:44 <clown> Next:  run jshint on *all* of the .js files in the linx project.
2014-05-15T16:49:57 * clown is that a google summer of code project?
2014-05-15T16:50:14 <clown> *linux project
2014-05-15T16:50:35 <jhernandez> so yes, we can put it in our pull request
2014-05-15T16:50:45 <clown> cool.
2014-05-15T16:50:55 <clown> jhernandez:  where is steve\'s pull request?
2014-05-15T16:51:03 <clown> the one you were looking at.
2014-05-15T16:53:29 <jhernandez> clown: https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/50
2014-05-15T16:53:38 <clown> thanks jhernandez
2014-05-15T16:54:54 <jhernandez> clown: re "is that a google summer of code project?" are you talking about proposing this for a GSoC?
2014-05-15T16:55:10 <clown> jhernandez:  not seriously.
2014-05-15T16:55:37 <clown> Running jshint on all the JS files in linux and fixing them should not take all summer...
2014-05-15T16:55:50 <clown> so, it was a (poor) joke.

2014-05-15T18:24:36 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon
2014-05-15T18:24:46 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2014-05-15T18:25:40 <cindyli> thanks for the pull request for FLUID-5371. the change for the model relay works great. I\'m having a question about the priority for an aggregate event
2014-05-15T18:25:58 <cindyli> an aggregate event: https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/FLOE-171/src/js/resourceInputPanel.js#L239-L246
2014-05-15T18:27:48 <cindyli> at line 177, dynamic components that create some input fields are created on event "onCreateInput". this event is fired by "afterMarkupReady" event which is one for the aggregate
2014-05-15T18:28:33 <cindyli> the unit test is using the aggregate "onReady", "last" priority to verify the rendering of input fields rendered by the dynamic component
2014-05-15T18:28:49 <cindyli> however, at that point, the fields are not rendered yet
2014-05-15T18:30:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s awkward, yes - aggregate events are fired themselves based on "non-priority timings"
2014-05-15T18:30:31 <Bosmon> In that a "last" event for an aggregate event may well fire earlier than a "last" event for one of its component events
2014-05-15T18:30:41 <cindyli> ok
2014-05-15T18:30:47 <Bosmon> If you want to "enlaten" things I only suggest that you create a FURTHER event to express this timing : P
2014-05-15T18:30:57 <Bosmon> In general the "listener priority fields" are only intended for "light use"
2014-05-15T18:31:08 <Bosmon> You shouldn\'t adopt them as an architectural strategy
2014-05-15T18:31:13 <cindyli> ok
2014-05-15T18:32:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: is there a way to find out if dynamicComponents are ready? since it\'s creating multiple instances?
2014-05-15T18:34:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - no, you will have to do it manually, sadly :(
2014-05-15T18:36:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: what i can think of to do it manually is to check the number of times that dynamic components are created (or rendered). or is there a better way?
2014-05-15T18:37:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - but you\'re generating them in response to events, right?
2014-05-15T18:37:06 <cindyli> eys
2014-05-15T18:37:07 <cindyli> yes
2014-05-15T18:37:25 <Bosmon> You\'re using the "event" rather than the "array" model for generation
2014-05-15T18:37:47 <Bosmon> So you can supply special configuration to the "final" component that means it fires a special event
2014-05-15T18:39:20 <Bosmon> Which is probably the simplest - given the firer of the event for the final component already knows that it is final
2014-05-15T18:40:47 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-05-15T18:41:29 * jhung has quit
2014-05-15T18:42:44 <Bosmon> Well, why even do that
2014-05-15T18:42:52 <Bosmon> Why not just fire a special event after all the creation events
2014-05-15T18:42:54 <Bosmon> That is far simpler
2014-05-15T19:00:44 <cindyli> well, i\'ve implemented the first suggestion ;)
2014-05-15T19:01:37 <cindyli> they seem pretty much same to me, all based on the number of event firing
2014-05-15T19:12:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: when the model is changed, which one would be processed last: the model listener with "last" priority, or the modelRelay defined in and for another component?
2014-05-15T19:12:59 <cindyli> it seems the latter is processed as the last
2014-05-15T19:13:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - the opposite should be the case, but you should not be able to observe the difference
2014-05-15T19:13:45 <Bosmon> With the implementation in my branch you are not informed of the action of relays until all of them are complete
2014-05-15T19:16:17 <cindyli> ok, trying more to confirm
2014-05-15T19:16:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - I mean, how can you observe the result of a modelRelay execpt through another listener?
2014-05-15T19:17:11 <cindyli> in this code: https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/FLOE-171/src/js/resourceInputPanel.js#L219-L220
2014-05-15T19:17:36 <cindyli> the model change on baseResourceInputPanel triggers the indicator component to update it\'s state
2014-05-15T19:18:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes - so how do you observe the change in the indicator component?
2014-05-15T19:18:23 <cindyli> in the unit test hooked in the "last" model listener, the model has been changed but the indicator state is not updated
2014-05-15T19:18:52 <Bosmon> cindyli - the fixes in my branch should make this impossible
2014-05-15T19:18:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: locate the indicator container and check the css
2014-05-15T19:19:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, but it must listen somehow
2014-05-15T19:19:07 <Bosmon> Using a modelListener
2014-05-15T19:19:19 <cindyli> ya, it is inside a model listener
2014-05-15T19:19:29 <cindyli> let me push up the code
2014-05-15T19:19:39 <Bosmon> ok, thanks

2014-05-15T13:08:27 <amilchev> Justin_o: hi, quick question: if an adjuster is declared in the auxiliary schema, but never mentioned in "groups" section, for instance: if there was no "cursorSize" here https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L98 , but the entry for cursorSize was defined https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L137-L145 - would the adjuster be rendered? I guess no, righ
2014-05-15T13:09:51 <Justin_o> amilchev: i believe it would be rendered, since you can have adjusters that don\'t live inside groups
2014-05-15T13:10:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: does that seem correct
2014-05-15T13:10:11 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-05-15T13:13:42 <cindyli> Justin_o, amilchev, that\'s correct
2014-05-15T13:13:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: am i correct or is amilchev :)
2014-05-15T13:14:36 <cindyli> Justin_o: sorry.. you are correct, the adjusters that are not used in a group would be rendered
2014-05-15T13:14:53 <amilchev> Justin_o, cindily: oh .. ok
2014-05-15T13:16:28 <amilchev> Justin_o, cindily then I suppose I\'ll need an advice on something
2014-05-15T13:16:32 <jessm> hey everyone: there\xe2\x80\x99s a 24 hr. inclusive design event going on, free: Inclusive Design 24 #ID24 is free, no registration needed, just go to http://inclusivedesign24.org  & join the live event
2014-05-15T13:17:56 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: ^
2014-05-15T13:18:15 <amilchev> Justin_o, cindily: what I\'m trying to do is tell PCP which groups & adjusters to show exactly - in other words, parametrise the auxiliarySchema
2014-05-15T13:18:20 <jessm> Justin_o: thanks for the correct keyword
2014-05-15T13:19:46 <Justin_o> amilchev: can you speak more about this, i\'m not sure i fully follow
2014-05-15T13:23:26 <amilchev> Justin_o, cindyli: currently the PCP shows the adjuster groups corresponding to these two components (for OS detection) https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L35-L165
2014-05-15T13:25:26 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay
2014-05-15T13:25:35 * michelled joined the channel
2014-05-15T13:25:45 <amilchev> Justin_o, cindyli: what I want is the MatchMaker to determine what adjusters PCP should show
2014-05-15T13:25:50 <Justin_o> michelled: good morning.. i updated the FLUID-5335 pull request
2014-05-15T13:26:16 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. my first thought is that the matchmakers should be supplying the auxiliary schema
2014-05-15T13:26:30 <Justin_o> amilchev:  or a means to build one i guess
2014-05-15T13:26:40 <michelled> thx Justin_o
2014-05-15T13:28:06 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeah, that was discussed on list, I was actually thinking if MM can only inform PCP of groups & adjusters, e.g. this part https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L87-L90 and leave the declarations for PCP - https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L103-L164
2014-05-15T13:30:35 <amilchev> Justin_o: I suppose there should be a handler in PCP which the flowManager will invoke once MM has sent the auxSchema info to FM - so I was thinking of creating a handler invoker in PCP, which receives a parameter determining auxSchema and then basing on it, renders the adjusters
2014-05-15T13:31:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: i suppose so.. the thing that comes to my mind right now is to use grade merging to construct the schema from the individual schema grades defining individual components.
2014-05-15T13:32:11 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-05-15T13:34:35 <Justin_o> i guess that should have been individual adjusters
2014-05-15T13:35:20 <amilchev> Justin_o: so you suggest defining components for each of these, e.g. https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L137-L145 and receive an array of such components
2014-05-15T13:35:30 * jhernandez has quit
2014-05-15T13:36:00 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. something like that.. cindyli do you think that makes sense?
2014-05-15T13:37:32 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-05-15T13:39:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: I can try out creating 2 small adjuster components and building small 2 adjuster auxSchema from them this way - if that works fine, we can think of how we\'ll determine adj groups (perhaps define whole groups as components too + option for overwriting the "panels" part https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L44-L47)
2014-05-15T13:42:14 <cindyli> Justin_o, amilchev, using grade version of UIO sounds like a good idea as it gives you more flexibility and power. with that, you can even use a dynamic grade to determine what adjuster grade components to be used based on the parameter from MM
2014-05-15T13:43:06 <cindyli> ah, i should no longer call it UIO, should rather be preference framework :)
2014-05-15T13:43:44 <amilchev> cindyli what do you mean by "grade version of prefs framework"?
2014-05-15T13:45:34 <cindyli> amilchev: i mean using grades to construct aux schema
2014-05-15T13:46:47 <amilchev> cindyli: you say it like that has been done before - are there any examples of this?
2014-05-15T13:47:41 <cindyli> amilchev: unfortunately, no. excited for being the first ever? ;)
2014-05-15T13:48:08 <amilchev> cindyli: haha yep, I\'ll have a try at it :)

2014-05-15T13:48:47 <cindyli> good luck, amilchev. ping us whenever u need a hand
2014-05-15T13:48:59 <amilchev> cindyli, Justin_o: perhaps I\'ll let you know how it goes - not meaning to take too much of your time :D
2014-05-15T13:49:06 <amilchev> thx
2014-05-15T13:49:14 <cindyli> np
2014-05-15T13:51:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: good luck :)
2014-05-15T13:51:51 <amilchev> thx
2014-05-15T13:53:42 <clown> hi jhernandez
2014-05-15T13:54:01 <clown> I\'m 2/3 of the way there re:  the fixes to findSearchPk.js
2014-05-15T13:54:26 <clown> I\'m hoping to send you a pull request later today.
2014-05-15T14:13:51 <jhung> Justin_o: new pull request sent for FLOE-186. https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/12
2014-05-15T14:14:06 <Justin_o> thanks jhung
2014-05-15T14:14:48 <clown> jhernandez:  FYI: gnome-a11y meeting now in #a11y-meeting
2014-05-15T14:18:38 <jhernandez> clown: ACK
2014-05-15T14:18:50 <clown> jhernandez:  :-)
2014-05-15T14:50:24 * amilchev has left the channel
2014-05-15T14:55:41 <clown> Bosmon:  do you have some time?
2014-05-15T15:05:13 <Justin_o> michelled: do you remember if we are removing deprecated docs? there\'s one doc task that has a note that part is deprecated.. should we just remove that part?
2014-05-15T15:05:38 <clown> jhernandez:  are you there?
2014-05-15T15:08:34 <jhernandez> clown: up & running
2014-05-15T15:08:38 <jhernandez> :)
2014-05-15T15:08:43 <jhernandez> sup?
2014-05-15T15:09:24 <clown> I\'m working on Bosmon\'s third comment:  "Please lint this file with infustion\'s grunt jshint task."
2014-05-15T15:09:47 <clown> I\'m wondering if just running jshint is okay.
2014-05-15T15:09:49 <clown> do you know?
2014-05-15T15:10:04 <jhernandez> nope
2014-05-15T15:10:21 <clown> Okay, I\'ll muddle through.  :-)
2014-05-15T15:10:43 <jhernandez> but maybe
2014-05-15T15:10:54 <jhernandez> someone here can help us
2014-05-15T15:11:44 <michelled> Justin_o: I\'m not sure - I think we need the deprecation warning
2014-05-15T15:12:54 <Justin_o> michelled: okay.. i\'m looking over the page now and i\'m not even sure which part should be deprecated
2014-05-15T15:13:00 <Justin_o> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Options+Merging
2014-05-15T15:13:25 <Justin_o> michelled:  the message left on the documentation planning page was "need to invert: declarative first and deprecate procedural"
2014-05-15T15:13:30 <clown> jhernandez:  I asked cindyli, but she\'s not certain how to do it outside of infusion (which is where our project is).
2014-05-15T15:14:01 <Justin_o> michelled:  i guess it\'s just the info about the function call should be dropped to the bottom
2014-05-15T15:16:43 <clown> rb
2014-05-15T15:16:47 <clown> brb
2014-05-15T15:17:51 <jhernandez> clown: ok, I got the same feeling when trying to understand how to do that
2014-05-15T15:21:28 <clown> jhernandez, I\'m looking at how it\'s done in infusion, and plan ot run jshint with the correct .jshintrc, and then follow its advice.
2014-05-15T15:21:54 <clown> Perhaps, if there is time, I\'ll bring it up at the DR meeting, in about 40 minutes.
2014-05-15T15:22:10 <clown> jhernandez:  I mean http://doodle.com/qdu28q4wzqyz2yq9
2014-05-15T15:24:34 <jhernandez> clown: actually, I\'m not sure if we are going to have it
2014-05-15T15:24:50 <jhernandez> colinclark: ^
2014-05-15T15:24:53 <clown> jhernandez:  good to know :-)
2014-05-15T15:25:11 <clown> I\'m available, but if it doesn\'t happen, that\'s cool too.
2014-05-15T15:25:42 <jhernandez> me too
2014-05-15T15:25:51 <colinclark> clown: Fire me a link to the repository where your code is?
2014-05-15T15:25:59 <colinclark> My impression is that you can and should whip up a quick Grunt script to do the JSHint for you
2014-05-15T15:26:14 <colinclark> it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty straightforward and I can point you to an example
2014-05-15T15:26:20 <clown> colinclark:  grabbing a link.
2014-05-15T15:26:22 <colinclark> but I just want to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking clearly
2014-05-15T15:26:30 <colinclark> as for the meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99m flexible
2014-05-15T15:26:45 <clown> colinclark:  I"m working on this pull request:  https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49
2014-05-15T15:26:46 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to join if we want to tlak about it
2014-05-15T15:26:58 <clown> the clode is currently in javi\'s github repostiory.
2014-05-15T15:27:01 <clown> *code
2014-05-15T15:27:10 <clown> I have a local branch where I\'m making the mods.
2014-05-15T15:27:39 <colinclark> Ok, so this is part of the Linux repository
2014-05-15T15:27:45 <clown> I\'m currently working on Bosmon\'s comment near the bottom of that.
2014-05-15T15:27:48 <clown> yes, colinclark
2014-05-15T15:27:54 <colinclark> jhernandez: Have you had a chance to look at sgithens\xe2\x80\x99 new Grunt scripts?
2014-05-15T15:29:04 * danaayotte has quit
2014-05-15T15:29:09 <jhernandez> colinclark: not yet, but I\'m looking forward to get to it
2014-05-15T15:29:15 <colinclark> ok
2014-05-15T15:29:24 <colinclark> let me think about this for a second
2014-05-15T15:29:32 <clown> time\'s up!
2014-05-15T15:29:35 <clown> :-)
2014-05-15T15:29:42 <colinclark> since Steve\xe2\x80\x99s scripts would be the perfect place to hang some JSHint action off of
2014-05-15T15:31:14 * jhernandez nods
2014-05-15T15:33:32 <jhernandez> in any case
2014-05-15T15:33:52 * michelled has quit
2014-05-15T15:33:55 <jhernandez> can\'t we just pass the script through http://www.jshint.com/ ?
2014-05-15T15:34:09 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'ve done that, and made some changes.
2014-05-15T15:34:13 <jhernandez> (not sure - just guessing)
2014-05-15T15:34:16 <colinclark> for now, yes
2014-05-15T15:34:19 <jhernandez> ok
2014-05-15T15:34:23 <colinclark> there should also be a command line version of JSHint that you can run
2014-05-15T15:34:30 <colinclark> which will read a .jshintrc file
2014-05-15T15:34:36 <clown> But, infusion has set some configuration in its jshintrc file that *might* be important.
2014-05-15T15:34:41 <colinclark> yes
2014-05-15T15:34:52 <clown> double quotes for strings always?  Really?
2014-05-15T15:34:57 <colinclark> Justin_o put a lot of thought into our configuration options for JSHint
2014-05-15T15:35:11 <colinclark> not going to debate the colour of the bike shed ;)
2014-05-15T15:35:39 <clown> right, just that I\'m in gnome style guide mode, which is, of course, different.
