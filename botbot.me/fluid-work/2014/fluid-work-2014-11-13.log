2014-11-13T14:35:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hey.. so finally getting back to those unit tests.. yesterday you were saying I needed to test LL LH HL HH but later said i only needed to vary one of delay and duration, so I\'m not sure why it isn\'t L and H
2014-11-13T14:40:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o ?
2014-11-13T14:40:24 <Justin_o> for the queued dataSource test
2014-11-13T14:40:26 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-11-13T14:40:38 <Bosmon> Could you re-express your question :)
2014-11-13T14:40:42 * yzen joined the channel
2014-11-13T14:41:26 <Justin_o> So you may recall yesterday we were talking about timing of the tests, patterns to test and the unreliability of setTimeout particularly for short intervals
2014-11-13T14:41:56 <Justin_o> you had said i would need to test 3 requests e.g. {get: [0, 100, 200]})
2014-11-13T14:42:08 <Justin_o> that there are 4 patterns i would need to test LL LH HL HH
2014-11-13T14:42:24 <Justin_o> and that i should only need to vary either delay or duration
2014-11-13T14:42:46 <Justin_o> the ones i listed in the sample object are delay between starting different get requests
2014-11-13T14:42:57 <Justin_o> so i\'m not exactly sure what the pattern is referring to
2014-11-13T14:43:07 <Justin_o> if there is only one variable
2014-11-13T14:43:08 <Bosmon> So you have 3 requests - and therefore 2 inter-request delays which you can vary
2014-11-13T14:43:34 <Bosmon> What you are trying to test is the system\'s response to different combinations of successive arrival times of the requests
2014-11-13T14:44:08 <Bosmon> The 4 patterns I mentioned seem like the bare minimum to get reasonable test coverage - although I think there are grounds for arguing there are some other conditions you could test
2014-11-13T14:44:44 <Bosmon> For example, the condition where all 3 requests arrive within the queue\'s time window might well represent a distinct configuration
2014-11-13T14:49:30 <Justin_o> okay.. so you mean say duration or a request is 100 ms. the tests would be [0, 50, 100], [0, 50, 150], [0, 150, 200], [0, 150, 300] and maybe [0, 50, 55]
2014-11-13T14:49:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2014-11-13T14:49:47 <Justin_o> so each letter referred to a delay interval between requests?
2014-11-13T14:50:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s right, yes
2014-11-13T14:51:10 <Bosmon> Either a delay, or a duration causing an overlap
2014-11-13T14:51:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay cool.. got it now... thanks again
2014-11-13T14:51:52 <Bosmon> np!
2014-11-13T14:52:12 <Bosmon> If we were being REALLY responsible about testing, we would test the complete matrix of all of these possibilities in both delay and duration
2014-11-13T14:52:21 <Bosmon> Then you\'d be REALLY glad we had a declarative test machinery : P
2014-11-13T14:54:05 <Bosmon> I remember explaining to Clayton my possibly irresponsible heuristic for this kind of situation though
2014-11-13T14:54:37 <Bosmon> Which is to try to trade off the "number of possible ways that the implementation might be faulty" against "the number of distinct situations tested in the test cases"
2014-11-13T14:54:52 <Bosmon> Where you could say that a good proxy for the former is something like "the number of distinct control flow paths through the system"
2014-11-13T14:55:31 <Bosmon> Which, to be sure, is pretty hard to quantify formally in a stateful system like this
2014-11-13T14:56:15 <Bosmon> But I\'d say that at the least, unless we had tested at least these obviously distinct overlap patterns, that we had no real confidence at all that the implementation was correct

2014-11-13T15:04:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: make sense.. the problem with testing is that it can go on to just about forever. Generally though you\'d like to hit all the edge cases and then at least one from the expected range.

2014-11-13T16:25:00 <colinclark> Justin_o: When did Infusion 1.5 come out?
2014-11-13T16:26:02 <colinclark> and also, anastasiac or simonjb or Justin_o, is our DocPad documentation hosted somewhere? or is the best place to read it on Github?
2014-11-13T16:26:44 <anastasiac> colinclark, right now, the best way to read the docs is the markdown on github. The generated HTML version is not yet hosted anywhere.
2014-11-13T16:27:29 <anastasiac> colinclark, if you\xe2\x80\x99re directing someone to the docs, give them a link to the readme that\xe2\x80\x99s inside the src/documents folder. That functions as a nice table of contents
2014-11-13T16:27:48 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/README.md

2014-11-13T16:30:04 <colinclark> do we have plans on when the HTML will be hosted too? does that coincide with our awesome new website rollout?
2014-11-13T16:30:38 <colinclark> anastasiac: Do you remember when 1.5 was released?

2014-11-13T17:22:26 <anastasiac> colinclark, sorry - missed your post. HTML hosting is waiting for the styling work to be finished. The basic stying is done, I believe, but we still need the ToC in a left sidebar. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\xe2\x80\x99re going to place any restrictions on the fluidproject rollout based on the docs
2014-11-13T17:22:30 <anastasiac> as for 1.5\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-11-13T17:22:31 <anastasiac> hm...
2014-11-13T17:22:47 <colinclark> ok
2014-11-13T17:23:09 <anastasiac> colinclark, according to github, 1.5 was tagged on June 17
2014-11-13T17:24:20 <colinclark> so long ago
2014-11-13T17:24:20 <colinclark> cool, thank you
