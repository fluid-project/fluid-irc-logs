2014-09-03T14:46:03 <Bosmon> hi cindyli - branch looks great!
2014-09-03T14:46:06 <Bosmon> Merged in and pushed
2014-09-03T14:46:14 <Bosmon> Thanks so much again for your long and patient work on this
2014-09-03T14:46:23 <cindyli> YAY!!! thanks, Bosmon
2014-09-03T15:18:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: i noticed the nested object definition in the "selectors" option is not allowed? like
2014-09-03T15:18:42 <cindyli> selectors: {
2014-09-03T15:18:42 <cindyli> matchConfirmation: {
2014-09-03T15:18:42 <cindyli> button: ".gpiic-matchConfirmation-button",
2014-09-03T15:18:42 <cindyli> icon: ".gpiic-matchConfirmation-icon"
2014-09-03T15:18:42 <cindyli> }
2014-09-03T15:18:43 <cindyli> }
2014-09-03T15:19:32 <cindyli> the container reference for the subcomponent such as
2014-09-03T15:19:32 <cindyli> container: "{feedback}.dom.matchConfirmation.button",
2014-09-03T15:20:04 <cindyli> throws error
2014-09-03T15:20:58 <cindyli> TypeError: this.each is not a function
2014-09-03T15:21:34 <cindyli> from jquery widget. probably because the reference for the subcomponent container was not resolved properly

2014-09-03T17:18:15 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - what would dom.matchConfirmation.button actually mean?
2014-09-03T17:18:25 <Bosmon> dom.matchConfirmation would be a jQuery object
2014-09-03T17:18:33 <Bosmon> So why would it have a property named "button"?
2014-09-03T17:19:21 <Bosmon> But I guess the answer is basically, yes, all the elements of a DOM binder must be presented at top level

2014-09-03T18:02:31 <cindyli> Justin_o: i wonder if you can review this pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/40. easier to test with your branch that implements the request dialog.
2014-09-03T18:02:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure i\'ll take  a look at that
2014-09-03T18:03:00 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
