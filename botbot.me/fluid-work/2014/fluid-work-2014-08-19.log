2014-08-19T13:53:31 <jhung> anastasiac and cindyli1: My FLOE-221 branch has a restructured repo. Can either of you take a look at it and see if it addresses the repo concerns raised yesterday? https://github.com/jhung/EPUB/tree/FLOE-221
2014-08-19T13:54:58 <anastasiac> jhung, the README will need to be updated to explain the hierarchy a bit, and reflect the new hierarchy (e.g. which book the videos are for, where to create the videos directory, etc)
2014-08-19T13:56:35 <anastasiac> jhung, the README at the root could probably discuss the videos in a generic way, saying \xe2\x80\x9clook at the readme in the videos folder of the book you want\xe2\x80\x9d or something like that
2014-08-19T13:56:56 <anastasiac> and it won\xe2\x80\x99t need to say \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a videos folder\xe2\x80\x9d since there\xe2\x80\x99s one already there
2014-08-19T13:57:13 <jhung> anastasiac: thanks. I\'ll fix those up.
2014-08-19T13:58:23 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the instructions for running pandoc: should we come up with a command line that can be run from the root of the book (i.e. not inside the html folder)? Would that work? That way, the product wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t end up inside the html folder
2014-08-19T14:00:49 <jhung> anastasiac: good point. I\'ll include that.
2014-08-19T14:09:09 <jhung> anastasiac: ah. Here\'s the twist. pandoc follows source paths relative to where it is executed. So we either have to execute pandoc inside the /html directory or move the html files into the book\'s root.
2014-08-19T14:09:52 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, let\xe2\x80\x99s leave the script so that it is run in the html folder, but can we specify the output location to be up one folder?
2014-08-19T14:11:47 <jhung> yep anastasiac. Would you rather the output epub go into the book root or into an /epub folder
2014-08-19T14:12:14 <anastasiac> not sure. book root seems fine to me, but what so you think?
2014-08-19T14:13:47 <jhung> I think the book root is fine as well anastasiac
2014-08-19T14:14:33 <anastasiac> sounds good to me, jhung

2014-08-19T14:48:17 <anastasiac> jhung, as far as I can tell, pandoc cannot handle adding the media overlay to the epub3 :-(
2014-08-19T14:52:51 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m investigating manually adding it to the archive after the fact
2014-08-19T15:02:22 <jhung> anastasiac: You may want to post to the pandoc discussions group and ask if there\'s any work-around?
2014-08-19T15:02:43 <anastasiac> good idea, jhung
2014-08-19T15:03:34 <jhung> They\'re pretty responsive (they fixed an issue I found within the same day of reporting it).
2014-08-19T15:05:55 <anastasiac> jhung, it\xe2\x80\x99s a google group, right?
2014-08-19T15:06:00 <jhung> yep
2014-08-19T15:12:46 <cindyli1> hi, Bosmon
2014-08-19T15:13:33 <Bosmon> Hi there, cindyli1
2014-08-19T15:14:13 <cindyli1> Bosmon: did you have a chance to have another look at justin\'s pull request for feedback tooltips - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/33
2014-08-19T15:15:06 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - yes, I believe it is ready to go
2014-08-19T15:15:09 <Bosmon> I should be able to test and push it later
2014-08-19T15:15:22 <cindyli1> that\'s great. thanks, Bosmon
2014-08-19T15:15:26 <Bosmon> btw you\'ll be glad to know I am just now fixing the IoC testing framework to remove this "listenerMaker" rubbish
2014-08-19T15:15:39 <Bosmon> I think actually you once filed a JIRA or a pull request about it, do you remember?
2014-08-19T15:15:42 <Bosmon> I don\'t seem to be able to find it now
2014-08-19T15:16:06 <cindyli1> let me dig into my branches..
2014-08-19T15:16:46 <Bosmon> Perhaps it was just a pull request without a matching JIRA....
2014-08-19T15:22:35 <cindyli1> Bosmon: not in any of my branches. one thing i recall is there was once I could find a way to pass in args into either the event handler or model change event. I was going to file a pull request for that, but it turned out it\'s already supported by using some sort of maker functions, so ended up no pull request for that. cannot think of anything else
2014-08-19T15:22:43 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-08-19T15:22:46 <Bosmon> That\'s vaguely what I remember too
2014-08-19T15:22:52 <Bosmon> But the maker functions are rather ridiculous
2014-08-19T15:23:02 <cindyli1> why?
2014-08-19T15:23:09 <Bosmon> Well, they\'re completely unnecessary
2014-08-19T15:23:25 <cindyli1> what\'s the other way you are thinking of?
2014-08-19T15:23:25 <Bosmon> If the IoC testing framework supported a standard IoC argument resolution syntax, you could just write normal functions
2014-08-19T15:23:35 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/33/files#diff-c7140e3280430e48c180664f93cc41b0R50
2014-08-19T15:23:39 <Bosmon> Instead of silly functions like this
2014-08-19T15:24:32 <cindyli1> haha, normal functions you mean to attach as regular listeners? but most of time you don\'t want those listeners to stay there forever
2014-08-19T15:24:44 <cindyli1> they are mostly intended to be only triggered once
2014-08-19T15:24:49 <cindyli1> in unit tests
2014-08-19T15:31:49 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-19T15:31:58 <Bosmon> Well sure
2014-08-19T15:32:01 <Bosmon> They still look silly though
2014-08-19T15:32:18 <Bosmon> Whether they are triggered once or not
2014-08-19T15:32:50 <Bosmon> All of our framework and GPII tests are littered with these silly XxxxMaker functions which return function ()

2014-08-19T19:42:32 <anastasiac> jhung, do you know how to get iBooks to use the read-aloud feature? how do I get it to actually use the narrationtrack so I can har it??
2014-08-19T19:49:37 <jhung> anastasiac: I am not sure if iBooks supports that. You may have to look it up. Readium should have voice support.
2014-08-19T19:50:04 <anastasiac> iBooks does support it, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to actually activate it
2014-08-19T19:50:14 <anastasiac> Readium works
2014-08-19T19:50:23 <anastasiac> at least, with the sample content
2014-08-19T19:50:25 <anastasiac> :-)
2014-08-19T19:50:48 <anastasiac> iBooks is recognizing that the audio is there, but...
2014-08-19T19:54:38 <jhung> anastasiac: Is there a speaker icon in the top-right corner next to the text size button?
2014-08-19T19:54:45 <anastasiac> yep
2014-08-19T19:54:47 <anastasiac> jhung, found the problem:
2014-08-19T19:54:56 <anastasiac> iBooks will not support the audio if the content is reflowable
2014-08-19T19:55:02 <anastasiac> which it is, in the moby dick sample
2014-08-19T19:55:19 <anastasiac> and my test
2014-08-19T19:55:24 <jhung> Oh.
2014-08-19T19:55:26 <anastasiac> ok, Readium it is
2014-08-19T19:55:41 <jhung> Here\'s something that may help anastasiac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdnyBtob-KE
2014-08-19T19:55:49 <jhung> How to add overlays into reflowable epub
2014-08-19T19:55:52 <anastasiac> jhung: http://matt.garrish.ca/2014/01/some-nuances-of-media-overlays/
