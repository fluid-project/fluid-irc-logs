2014-02-20T14:14:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac, jhung: are you guys planning on sending out an e-mail regarding the conversation from the community meeting yesterday?
2014-02-20T14:14:50 * yzen has quit
2014-02-20T14:15:11 <anastasiac> Justin_o, we should probably do that, summarizing what was discussed and what the next steps are...
2014-02-20T14:15:47 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes, that would be great.. I\'m hoping we can keep the ball rolling

2014-02-20T14:16:25 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o - sounds good! anastasiac do you have time to draft an email? I\'m trying to get the CSS framework criteria table done. Hopefully it can roll out the same time as the email.
2014-02-20T14:16:58 <anastasiac> I\'ll give it a shot, jhun
2014-02-20T14:18:22 <jhung> thanks anastasiac.

2014-02-20T16:45:07 <jhung> simonjb: let me know when you want to talk about the demoMenu. We can do skype or in this channel
2014-02-20T16:46:42 <simonjb> jhung: we can chat here
2014-02-20T16:47:55 <jhung> Sure simonjb.
2014-02-20T16:48:00 <simonjb> jhung: when we talked last, we identified 4 areas that can be customized on a page by page basis: title, description, instructions, and the link destinations
2014-02-20T16:48:34 <simonjb> can each of the title, description, and instructions contain abritrary HTML?
2014-02-20T16:48:39 <jhung> Yes simonjb, but I think we\'ll be adding 2 more: component name and component version.
2014-02-20T16:48:53 <simonjb> ok
2014-02-20T16:49:31 <simonjb> jhung: which of the customizable sections can contain HTML and which are text only?
2014-02-20T16:50:05 <jhung> simonjb: I think the description and instructions are the only ones that will have arbitrary html.
2014-02-20T16:50:45 <simonjb> jhung: thanks; also -- what are the requirements for localization?
2014-02-20T16:52:14 <jhung> simonjb: not sure if I understand the question completely, but I figure we would follow the localization scheme implemented for other components. Any hard coded string in the HTML should be in a bundle.
2014-02-20T16:53:51 <simonjb> jhung: does that include the customizable parts? can those go into a bundle? can bundles be specified on a page by page basis?
2014-02-20T16:56:10 <jhung> simonjb: I figure the customizable part (title, description, etc) should be in the same bundle to make ease of localization easier. Not sure what you mean by bundles specified by a "page by page" basis. Clarify?
2014-02-20T17:02:16 <simonjb> jhung: I\'m thinking that there will be text that is localized that is common to all usages of the component (such as "code", "API", and "design" for the link labels) and then there will be text that varies across uages, such as the description
2014-02-20T17:03:46 <simonjb> jhung: in this case the desciption would vary on a page by page basis
2014-02-20T17:09:30 <jhung> simonjb: I understand now. Yes that will be the case.
2014-02-20T17:10:12 <simonjb> jhung: cool; and message bundles can contain HTML?
2014-02-20T17:11:05 <jhung> simonjb: I assume so? Not sure how we\'ve handled such cases in the past. cindyli or Justin_o may be able to give you some pointers.
2014-02-20T17:14:42 <Justin_o> jhung: what do you mean by arbitrary markup
2014-02-20T17:14:43 <Justin_o> ?
2014-02-20T17:15:23 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o: I\'ve updated http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5276 with the new customizable parts and which parts need HTML
2014-02-20T17:15:23 <jhung> html Justin_o - specifically links, <em>, img, etc.
2014-02-20T17:16:39 <Justin_o> jhung: do those follow any consistent patterns?
2014-02-20T17:17:10 <Justin_o> jhung: also will instructions always be a list of one or more things?
2014-02-20T17:17:16 <jhung> Justin_o: I assume it will not. Some demos may choose not to use any markup, but some may want images, lists etc.
2014-02-20T17:17:34 <Justin_o> jhung, simonjb: typically we would not include markup in the strings.. we could use the markup as a template for which we put strings into though.
2014-02-20T17:18:27 <jhung> Unfortunately the description and instruction sections of the demoMenu will not follow a predictable template.
2014-02-20T17:18:31 <jhung> ^Justin_o
2014-02-20T17:18:52 <Justin_o> jhung: :(
2014-02-20T17:19:57 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. so basically you want those sections be free form that can take on any markup
2014-02-20T17:20:13 <jhung> Justin_o: yes.

2014-02-20T17:24:20 <jhung> simonjb: great!
2014-02-20T17:26:09 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'m checking up on http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/VP-323, the low-contrast icons for video player. You provided light-grey-on-dark-grey versions, but I discovered that I need the inverse for keyboard focus indication. Did you get anywhere with that?
2014-02-20T17:27:07 <jhung> anastasiac: I have not done that. Do you want me to take a look at that or will you handle it?
2014-02-20T17:27:46 <anastasiac> you could probably do it much faster than me, jhung :-)
2014-02-20T17:28:01 <jhung> sure anastasiac. I\'ll take a look.
