2014-03-28T13:47:21 <jhung> Justin_o, cindyli - I was thinking that with the redesign of the metadata demo, I was wondering if we should take the opportunity to switch to Foundation? Whether we keep using Bootstrap and restyle, or use Foundation and rebuild - it\'ll roughly be the same amount of work.
2014-03-28T13:47:42 <jhung> I almost prefer starting from scratch with Foundation. Seems cleaner that way.
2014-03-28T13:49:25 <cindyli> jhung:
2014-03-28T13:49:27 <cindyli> +1
2014-03-28T13:50:06 <cindyli> also a good practise to try out Foundation with a real project
2014-03-28T13:53:23 <jhung> cindyli: just to clarify - we\'d be using Foundation for the demo, and not the Metadata component.
2014-03-28T13:53:47 <cindyli> ah ok

2014-03-28T15:50:44 <cindyli> hi, kasparnet
2014-03-28T15:50:51 <kasparnet> hi cindyli
2014-03-28T15:51:50 <cindyli> i\'m wring the invertConfiguration for the conditional transform, before doing that, need to create another transform
2014-03-28T15:54:13 <cindyli> kasparnet: the unit test for the new transform: http://pastie.org/8976290
2014-03-28T15:54:18 <cindyli> does it make sense to you?
2014-03-28T15:57:29 <kasparnet> yeah - that makes sense and looks very useful! Although I think the name confused me a bit
2014-03-28T15:57:45 <kasparnet> it seems to me to be closer to something like a "switch" statement
2014-03-28T16:00:55 <kasparnet> but then, being a non native english speaker I dont know if I\'m the best person to make statements on the sensibility of function naming :)
2014-03-28T16:00:58 <kasparnet> cindyli: ^
2014-03-28T16:01:34 <cindyli> kasparnet: with "switch" embedded?
2014-03-28T16:01:41 <jhernandez> clown: now we have a bat, a moose, a hippo and a badger
2014-03-28T16:01:42 <Justin_o> kasparnet: your english is probably better than mine, and I only speak english :)
2014-03-28T16:01:55 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-03-28T16:02:51 <cindyli> kasparnet: how does this look like - http://pastie.org/8976304
2014-03-28T16:03:31 <kasparnet> cindyli: tbh, I\'m not sure what a more appropriate name should be, as something like switch has all sorts of implicit expectations from the normal use (eg. after the first match, everything following that is considered a match until a \'break\' is issued, etc)
2014-03-28T16:03:45 <cindyli> or use "cases" rather than "switch"
2014-03-28T16:04:21 <cindyli> to avoid the confusion and implication
2014-03-28T16:04:22 <clown> jhernandez:  a bat?  Cool.
2014-03-28T16:04:37 <kasparnet> yeah - that sounds sensible to me, cindyli
2014-03-28T16:04:48 <kasparnet> perhaps Bosmon has an opinion on this as well
2014-03-28T16:05:34 <kasparnet> but I like that the cases are in a block for themselves - it makes it clearer what the transformation does
2014-03-28T16:06:04 <kasparnet> (and allows us to use reserved words, like "type", etc., for the cases)
2014-03-28T16:06:47 <cindyli> make sense, kasparnet. i noticed with "fluid.multiInputTransformFunction" as a grade for a transform, the paths defined in "inputVariables" will be populated before reaching the actual transform function
2014-03-28T16:07:35 <kasparnet> I think that has been changed as of earlier this week
2014-03-28T16:08:03 <kasparnet> cindyli: you should now get functions passed to you, that your function is itself responsible for executing
2014-03-28T16:08:09 * kasparnet is looking for the pull request
2014-03-28T16:08:16 <cindyli> ok
2014-03-28T16:08:32 <cindyli> btw, kasparnet, your pull for 5251 is already in the master
2014-03-28T16:08:47 <kasparnet> cindyli: yeah - this was the one I was talking about
2014-03-28T16:08:51 <kasparnet> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/477
2014-03-28T16:09:08 <cindyli> cool. it\'s merged
2014-03-28T16:09:43 <cindyli> seems the conditional transform is still using the strategy of "inputVariables"
2014-03-28T16:10:15 <kasparnet> cindyli: ah yes, I guess that requires some explaining
2014-03-28T16:11:18 <cindyli> i was initially thinking about something like this for the new transform defaults:
2014-03-28T16:11:27 <cindyli> fluid.defaults("fluid.metadata.transforms.literalCondition", {
2014-03-28T16:11:27 <cindyli> gradeNames: [ "fluid.multiInputTransformFunction", "fluid.standardOutputTransformFunction" ],
2014-03-28T16:11:27 <cindyli> inputVariables: {
2014-03-28T16:11:27 <cindyli> "condition": null,
2014-03-28T16:11:27 <cindyli> "cases.flashing": null,
2014-03-28T16:11:28 <cindyli> "cases.noflashing": null
2014-03-28T16:11:28 <cindyli> }
2014-03-28T16:11:29 <cindyli> });
2014-03-28T16:11:34 <kasparnet> so the idea is that you can define all these input variables, that will be sent to you as functions, which on execution will evaluate the varilable (ie run the transformation, read the input path, etc) and return the value
2014-03-28T16:12:21 <kasparnet> cindyli: hmm.. yeah - I guess this is quite tricky when you have a variable number of cases and naming for them
2014-03-28T16:12:29 <cindyli> exactly
2014-03-28T16:12:33 <cindyli> that\'s where the problem is
2014-03-28T16:12:35 <kasparnet> crap
2014-03-28T16:12:36 <kasparnet> :)
2014-03-28T16:13:52 <kasparnet> I guess one solution would be to have the inputvariables be "condition" and "cases"
2014-03-28T16:13:53 <cindyli> so, i\'m thinking to dynamically retrieve paths from "cases" block and re-calculate their values, which means repeating what fluid.multiInputTransformFunction has done.
2014-03-28T16:14:42 <cindyli> yes, we can but still need to repeat each getValue process for sub-paths from "cases"
2014-03-28T16:15:24 <cindyli> does that sound right to you or you have a better solution, kasparnet?
2014-03-28T16:16:49 <kasparnet> cindyli: I dont really, no
2014-03-28T16:17:22 * greggy2 has quit
2014-03-28T16:17:47 <cindyli> ok, thanks, kasparnet, i will carry on with this solution. wish me good luck ;)
2014-03-28T16:17:52 <kasparnet> cindyli: these \'special case\' functions might have a hard time getting passed a review with the good Dr. Bosmon
2014-03-28T16:18:04 <kasparnet> but then, I dont really have anything better
2014-03-28T16:18:15 <kasparnet> so I think it\'s sensible to move on with
2014-03-28T16:18:46 <kasparnet> and yeah - good luck on it -- at least to me, the modeltransformation framework was a bit overwhelming to get into :)
2014-03-28T16:19:09 <kasparnet> cindyli: I\'ll be around for a couple hours more, so ping me if you got any questions
2014-03-28T16:19:19 <cindyli> i\'m creating the new transform in the metadata demo, not the framework core. hopefully this will make it less sensible
2014-03-28T16:19:30 <cindyli> thanks very much, kasparnet
2014-03-28T16:19:30 <kasparnet> yup
2014-03-28T16:19:58 <kasparnet> although that transformation seems like a very useful one - so it would be nice to get into the core framework as well
2014-03-28T16:20:54 <cindyli> yes, let\'s see ...
