2014-08-27T13:54:53 <danaayotte> hi michelled I\'m looking at those feedback demo instructions now
2014-08-27T13:54:57 * Bosmon has quit
2014-08-27T13:55:07 <danaayotte> am i right in thinking that the intended audience for the instructions is very broad?
2014-08-27T13:55:34 <danaayotte> from someone who might know what we mean by "resource" for example, and someone who wouldn\'t?
2014-08-27T13:57:11 <Justin_o> clown: for the aria status role http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#status
2014-08-27T13:57:20 <danaayotte> or the idea of a resource "matching preferences" etc...just thinking about ways we can word it more clearly
2014-08-27T13:57:28 <danaayotte> michelled ^
2014-08-27T13:57:34 <Justin_o> clown: when it says "If another part of the page controls what appears in the status, authors SHOULD make the relationship explicit with the aria-controls attribute."
2014-08-27T13:57:52 <clown> Justin_o:  Yes?
2014-08-27T13:58:17 <Justin_o> does that mean that if it is just reporting the state of the UI that everything that affects the state will have to add an aria-controls attribute?
2014-08-27T13:58:43 * Bosmon joined the channel
2014-08-27T14:00:16 <clown> Justin_o:  I\'m not sure I understand the question.  How manys status messages are there?  Is it a fixed set?  Aribitrarily large?
2014-08-27T14:00:51 <clown> If every UI element can change the status message, then, I\'d say every UI element "controls" the status.
2014-08-27T14:01:00 <Justin_o> clown: yes.. fixed set.. at the moment there aren\'t too many items that trigger an action which results in the status message being updated but this will likely grow.
2014-08-27T14:01:11 <Justin_o> clown: okay.. and each of those items needs a controls attribute?
2014-08-27T14:01:23 <clown> I\'d say so.
2014-08-27T14:02:02 <Justin_o> currently it\'s being updated for logout, save, and modified.. currently there is only one thing that modifies but there could be many
2014-08-27T14:02:07 <Justin_o> clown: okay thanks
2014-08-27T14:02:33 <clown> But, I\'m going to check the best practices and mapping guides to see if there is anything there that might help you.
2014-08-27T14:06:32 <Justin_o> clown: thanks
2014-08-27T14:08:39 <clown> Justin_o:  the section on aria-controls does sort-of imply what I said above.  See the second bullet about a set of checkboxes controlling a live region:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-1.1/states_and_properties#aria-controls
2014-08-27T14:09:19 <michelled> danaayotte: yes, all of the demo instructions should be made clear to someone new to our work.
2014-08-27T14:09:32 <danaayotte> thanks michelled
2014-08-27T14:09:41 <michelled> we expect them to be able to be a first point of entry
2014-08-27T14:10:36 <Justin_o> clown: in that example is the aria-controls on each radio button or on something containing the set?
2014-08-27T14:11:36 <clown> On each *checkbox*.  If they were radio buttons, then I would put the control relationship on the radio group.

2014-08-27T14:42:22 <clown> how are you feeling?  Still cold-ing?
2014-08-27T14:42:28 <jhernandez> nope
2014-08-27T14:42:30 <jhernandez> much better
2014-08-27T14:42:34 <jhernandez> :)
2014-08-27T14:42:35 <clown> \\o/
2014-08-27T14:42:58 <clown> anyhow, I assigned GPII-920 to you, but I\'m not sure if that\'s okay.
2014-08-27T14:43:13 <jhernandez> clown: it\'s ok
2014-08-27T14:43:21 <clown> cool.
2014-08-27T14:44:17 <jhernandez> I\'ll take a look/review today
2014-08-27T14:44:28 <clown> even cooler.  :-)
2014-08-27T14:44:40 <jhernandez> I\'m trying to finish a pull request for android
2014-08-27T14:44:59 <jhernandez> (which is almost there)
2014-08-27T14:44:59 <jhernandez> :)
2014-08-27T14:45:01 <clown> that\'s probably more important.  But I\'m just guessing.
2014-08-27T14:45:10 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-08-27T14:50:16 <Justin_o> clown: just saw your last reply.. in terms of radio buttons and etc.. could we put the controls attribute on the entire widget? In this case PMT/PCP or would it be more appropriate to put it on each specific element

2014-08-27T15:15:13 <clown> Justin_o:  just saw your latest question.
2014-08-27T15:15:37 <clown> The thing about a group of radio buttons is that they are mutually exclusive, so there is but one value for the group.
2014-08-27T15:15:47 <Justin_o> clown: right.. that makes sense
2014-08-27T15:16:17 <clown> So the element that groups them should have a radio group role.  And that radiogroup is the controller for the status.
2014-08-27T15:16:32 <clown> But a set of checkboxes may not form a group.
2014-08-27T15:17:00 <clown> I\'m not certain what is going on in your specific case \xe2\x80\x94 the PMT/PCP

2014-08-27T15:21:23 <Justin_o> clown: it\'s basically a set of adjusters grouped into separate panels. The tool also has a login/logout and save feature
2014-08-27T15:21:30 <Justin_o> not sure if that makes things any clearer
2014-08-27T15:21:53 <clown> "adjusters"?  Like sliders and/or spinners?
