2014-04-30T17:48:56 <jhung> anastasiac: recall the bug I was asking you to test yesterday? It appears it may be specific to preferences framework.
2014-04-30T17:49:11 <anastasiac> interesting
2014-04-30T17:50:19 <jhung> Not sure if it\'s something about that demo in particular or if it\'s something related to the components.
2014-04-30T17:50:45 <anastasiac> yeah, that\'s a strange one.
2014-04-30T17:57:52 <jhung> I\'ve reopened the bug and made necessary updates to the ticket. I guess we\'ll leave it open if someone goes looking for it.

2014-04-30T18:27:07 <Justin_o> jhung: I was just showing vjoanna the changes you made to the overviewPanel
2014-04-30T18:27:53 <Justin_o> jhung: so I think there were two things that came out of that. 1) she was hoping that clicking outside of the panel would automatically close it 2) the animation looks like it goes behind the "*" because the "*" isn\'t flush to the corner
2014-04-30T18:29:16 <jhung> 1. Clicking outside the overviewPanel was the way it was implemented originally, but it was confusing. I think simonjb, vjoanna, and I sat down to look it over.
2014-04-30T18:29:34 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: today we\'ll be doing some pre-testing for the Infusion 1.5 release. No testing experience required, in fact, lack of experience testing the components could be an asset. Let me know if you\'d like to join.
2014-04-30T18:29:46 <jhung> In the end we decided to have the user explicitly press Close or the star.
2014-04-30T18:30:36 <jhung> as for #2 - I can see what I can do to tweak that. It shouldn\'t be a problem to fix.
2014-04-30T18:30:50 <vjoanna> jhung: i remember there was an issue with tabbing outside to close, but can\'t remember the issue with clicking outside?
2014-04-30T18:30:56 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-04-30T18:32:21 <jhung> ah yes vjoanna that was it. If using keyboard to tab through, tabbing out of the overview panel closes it automatically. It seemed a bit odd.
2014-04-30T18:33:34 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I\'m just going to coordinate the community meeting in the channel for anyone who\'d like to participate
2014-04-30T18:33:57 <anastasiac> Justin_o, count me in
2014-04-30T18:34:00 <jhung> vjoanna: I actually prefer it remaining open until explicitly closed. It\'s informational content, so I think we would want the user to intentionally dismiss it rather than doing it accidentally. What do you think?
2014-04-30T18:34:02 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2014-04-30T18:34:48 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: the demos can be reached from here http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/demos/
2014-04-30T18:35:13 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: instructional demos http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/instructionalDemos/
2014-04-30T18:35:30 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: integration demos http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/integration-demos/
2014-04-30T18:35:50 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: standalone demos http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/standalone-demos/
2014-04-30T18:36:11 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: tests both manual and unit  http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/src/tests/
2014-04-30T18:36:57 <vjoanna> jhung: I think the issue with tabbing that simonjb pointed out was that if you switch applications the panel closes. Does the same apply for closing the panel on clicking out? I prefer that it closes on clicking out because it overlaps content and the close button isn\'t that obvious.
2014-04-30T18:37:07 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: it would be good to get some broad testing coverage across the supported browsers Internet Explorer (8, 9, 10, 11) and latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome
2014-04-30T18:37:34 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: Please post what you are testing and in which platform...
2014-04-30T18:37:57 <anastasiac> Justin_o,  what should we do with the results of our testing?
2014-04-30T18:38:02 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: incidentally i\'ve already run all the unit tests across all platforms, so no requirement to do that this time round
2014-04-30T18:38:37 <vjoanna> jhung: If the panel was persistent it will be better that it pushes the content over instead of overlap
2014-04-30T18:40:01 <jhung> vjoanna: ok. I\'ll create a Jira for it.
2014-04-30T18:41:23 <vjoanna> jhung: thanks!
2014-04-30T18:41:24 <jhung> vjoanna: however, is it okay for the overviewPanel be merged with master assuming the transition animation gets fixed? We can address the hide/open interaction in a separate pull request.
2014-04-30T18:42:49 <vjoanna> jhung: sure
2014-04-30T18:42:58 <jhung> great thanks vjoanna
2014-04-30T18:46:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: good question about what to do with the results.. this is fairly informal, but we should file jiras for anything issues found..
2014-04-30T18:47:17 <anastasiac> ok, Justin_o, I\'ll just make notes for myself first as I test
2014-04-30T18:47:29 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2014-04-30T18:47:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you are around.. i think a lot of the IE8 issues may be stemming from something on line 322 of dataBinding.js
2014-04-30T18:48:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s just from some brief preliminary investigation
2014-04-30T18:48:35 * michelled joined the channel
2014-04-30T18:49:11 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I\'m going to start looking at the demos in IE 11
2014-04-30T18:49:43 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: I\'ll torture myself and start looking at the demos in IE 8
2014-04-30T18:49:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay :)
2014-04-30T18:50:18 <Justin_o> anastasiac: just as a heads up you may want to see that note i left Bosmon above
2014-04-30T18:50:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: if you find any issues, can you see if they are related to that.
2014-04-30T18:50:50 <anastasiac> ok
2014-04-30T18:51:25 <michelled> fluid-everyone: I\'ll start looking at demos in chome
2014-04-30T18:57:27 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: if you file a jira, please let us know about it in the channel so that we can determine if it is a blocker for the release
2014-04-30T18:58:14 <anastasiac> Justin_o, here\'s an interesting one: IE8 can\'t display github.com. At all.
2014-04-30T18:58:24 <michelled> it makes me happy that the FSS demos have been removed :)
2014-04-30T18:59:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that is interesting.. i\'m going to guess github won\'t be fixing that.
2014-04-30T18:59:39 <anastasiac> hope not
2014-04-30T19:00:45 * vjoanna has quit
2014-04-30T19:01:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you think it is an issue for our links out to github and/or the visibility of our code
2014-04-30T19:02:20 <anastasiac> not sure, Justin_o\xe2\x80\xa6 not sure what to do with this issue
2014-04-30T19:04:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: I\'d like to ignore it ;)
2014-04-30T19:04:39 <anastasiac> colinclark, Jusin_o, I filed that TTS+hidden panel bug: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5346
2014-04-30T19:04:55 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think there isn\'t much we could do really... and I think we are going to post a zip or two on our website post release. Also I don\'t think we\'ll be supporting IE8 after 1.5
2014-04-30T19:05:12 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2014-04-30T19:05:14 <anastasiac> oh, good!
2014-04-30T19:05:22 <anastasiac> do we have to wait til after?
2014-04-30T19:06:01 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sadly I think so
2014-04-30T19:13:50 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I filed http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5347 and http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5348. I don\'t think either are blockers for 1.5
2014-04-30T19:16:53 <anastasiac> Jusitn_o, I\'ve added IE8 to the environment for those two issues
2014-04-30T19:17:01 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2014-04-30T19:17:11 <colinclark> thanks so much anastasiac
2014-04-30T19:17:24 <colinclark> sorry to just drop it in your lap like that\xe2\x80\x94I was demoing and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to forget
2014-04-30T19:17:28 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I\'ve filed http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5349 which is to update the description for the climate change demo. I think we should do this for the 1.5 release

2014-04-30T19:32:50 <jhung> michelled: it\'s been done. FLUID-5322 I think.
2014-04-30T19:34:21 <michelled> oh! should I close it as a duplicate?
2014-04-30T19:34:41 <jhung> I can close it for you. You keep on testing michelled! :)
2014-04-30T19:34:53 <michelled> thx jhung!
2014-04-30T19:35:58 <jhung> michelled: I see in your screen capture there is a blue focus border even though you are in contrast mode. Can you reproduce that bug? I ran into it previously but couldn\'t duplicate it.
2014-04-30T19:37:45 <michelled> jhung: yes, I\'m getting a blue focus styling
2014-04-30T19:39:25 <michelled> jhung: both Chrome and FF
2014-04-30T19:39:31 <jhung> in all contrast modes? I\'m not seeing it in my local branch - so I may have inadvertently fixed it already in my pull request michelled. Rather file a new jira, I\'ll make a note to retest this.
2014-04-30T19:40:46 <michelled> thanks jhung
2014-04-30T19:40:48 <jhung> Yes. I\'m pretty sure I fixed it. I see it on the build site but not in my branch.
2014-04-30T19:40:52 <michelled> yep, all high contrast themes
2014-04-30T19:41:01 <jhung> thanks michelled
2014-04-30T19:42:29 <michelled> jhung: do you know if the keyboard focus issue for setting themes has been filed? basically, you can change the theme using the keyboard, but the controls are offscreen
2014-04-30T19:43:53 <jhung> Doesn\'t ring a bell michelled. I\'ll look it up.
2014-04-30T19:47:09 <jhung> michelled - doesn\'t look like this has been filed. Basically we would want focus still visible when changing themes. Currently the horizontal scroll goes to home with each theme transition.
2014-04-30T19:47:32 <michelled> is that what\'s happening?
2014-04-30T19:47:51 <michelled> jhung: any chance you could file that? I couldn\'t figure out how to explain what is happening
2014-04-30T19:49:10 <jhung> It seems like that michelled. I\'ll file a jira.

2014-04-30T20:28:02 <anastasiac> Bosmon, would I be able to use an expander to construct the modelListeners block?
2014-04-30T20:29:43 <anastasiac> and Bosmon, if so, should the expansion happen before the onCreate event?
2014-04-30T20:30:56 <Bosmon> anastasiac - you would not be able to
2014-04-30T20:31:15 <anastasiac> ah, that would explain why it\'s not working :-)
2014-04-30T20:31:28 <Bosmon> This is described by http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5208
2014-04-30T20:31:39 <Bosmon> Unfortunately we have been able to implement such a facility so far
2014-04-30T20:32:13 <anastasiac> my scenario is where the actual model paths need to be constructed from other integrator-provided options
2014-04-30T20:32:59 <Bosmon> anastasiac - you\'d be safest to construct such configuration manually, using the kinds of schemes we use in the AuxBuilder etc.
2014-04-30T20:33:10 <anastasiac> it\'s related to the show/hide stuff http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4928
2014-04-30T20:33:13 <Bosmon> And then constructing a "nonce grade" using a unique key
2014-04-30T20:33:40 <anastasiac> interesting. I\'ll look at the aux builder for inspiration. I\'m not that familiar with how it does this
2014-04-30T20:33:41 <Bosmon> anastasiac - what kind of extension do you need to the scheme which cindyli implemented already?
2014-04-30T20:34:24 <anastasiac> cindyli\'s implementation uses that.applier.modelChanged.addListener() in a fluid.each loop. I was looking into doing it declaratively
2014-04-30T20:34:38 <Bosmon> anastasiac - cindyli\'s implementation *is* declarative
2014-04-30T20:34:41 <Bosmon> From the point of view of the user
2014-04-30T20:34:44 <Bosmon> And that is what matters
2014-04-30T20:34:54 <Bosmon> There\'s no point implementing a declarative scheme to implement declarative configuration : P
2014-04-30T20:35:02 <Bosmon> The turtles have to stop somewhere....
2014-04-30T20:35:08 <anastasiac> :-)
2014-04-30T20:35:15 <anastasiac> I can certainly agree with that
2014-04-30T20:35:51 <anastasiac> Bosmon, the modelChanged event should fire AFTER the model is actually changed, right?
2014-04-30T20:35:57 <Bosmon> anastasiac - correct
2014-04-30T20:36:15 <Bosmon> What application are you working on?
2014-04-30T20:36:32 <anastasiac> VideoPlayer - upgrading to the latest Infusion
2014-04-30T20:36:45 <anastasiac> taking advantage of all the new model relay stuff
2014-04-30T20:37:00 <anastasiac> hopefully getting rid of the VPs private model relay
2014-04-30T20:37:19 <Bosmon> anastasiac - cool
2014-04-30T20:37:35 <anastasiac> it\'s really cleaning the code up, which is great
2014-04-30T20:37:47 <Bosmon> Hopefully you have remembered that we are still blocked on http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5249 before we can integrate the videoplayer with UIO
2014-04-30T20:37:54 <Bosmon> But certainly there\'s lots of modernising we can do before that
2014-04-30T20:40:48 <anastasiac> I was not aware of the relationship with 5249. But you\'re right, it still needs to be upgraded. We want to add the overview panel to the demo, so we need it for that, at least :-)

2014-04-30T12:49:16 <Justin_o> I think we\'re safe to close that discussion now
2014-04-30T12:49:43 <jhung> great Justin_o. I\'m guessing this should be documented somewhere?
2014-04-30T12:50:07 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you have thoughts on this ^
2014-04-30T12:51:22 <anastasiac> I\'m pretty much in accord with jhung\'s summary on list, Justin_o, and +1 for creating a wiki page in the fluid space summarizing our decisions and motivations
2014-04-30T12:55:00 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac: I\'m going to see if there\'s a more appropriate spot for this documentation. Currently I\'ve been working out of the Infusion 1.5 release status section
2014-04-30T13:11:58 <anastasiac> jhung, I think documenting what we\'re planning to do, how we\'re planning to use or not use a CSS framework, pertaining to both Infusion and our sites \xe2\x80\x93 that belongs in the Fluid wiki space, not in the Infusion docs
2014-04-30T13:12:48 <jhung> anastasiac: yep. FYI here\'s what I meant http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Project+Support+for+CSS+Frameworks (not Infusion docs)
2014-04-30T13:13:47 <anastasiac> looks, good, but you\'re right, I think part of 1.5 release status is not quite the right place. Maybe as a subpage of http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Development ?
2014-04-30T13:14:10 <jhung> anastasiac: ok. I\'ll look there.
2014-04-30T13:15:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i updated my FLOE-116 pull request the other day, not sure if you\'ve had a chance to look at it yet

2014-04-30T14:07:33 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o - the refactored test looks great!
2014-04-30T14:07:55 <Bosmon> Do you have plans for the final test in resourceInputPanelTests.js ?
2014-04-30T14:08:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-04-30T14:08:05 <Bosmon> I can\'t quite follow the comment there, is it still current?
2014-04-30T14:10:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'ve changed this one in the FLOE-171 branch.. here\'s my change from there https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-171/tests/js/resourceInputPanelTests.js#L227-L249
2014-04-30T14:10:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - would it be possible to express that as a grade rather than floating function material?
2014-04-30T14:11:36 <Bosmon> FLOE-171 is cindy\'s branch with the up to date modelRelay, right?
2014-04-30T14:11:45 <Justin_o> the comment is the same though.. i think it\'s still relevant although i made this change a long time ago.. the issue is that i have two events that are triggered by the creation of the parent component.. which we would use the IoCSS reference too, but this doesn\'t work for more than one event in the IoC Testing framework
2014-04-30T14:11:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2014-04-30T14:12:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you sketch out which the events are, I\'m having trouble following
2014-04-30T14:14:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s onReady and afterRender
2014-04-30T14:15:48 <Justin_o> the onReady is in this test https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-116/tests/js/resourceInputPanelTestUtils.js#L110-L112
2014-04-30T14:16:08 <Justin_o> so i seem to have wanted to have them both in the same test structure
2014-04-30T14:20:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - couldn\'t you just write one fixture after the other - that is, two "listener" records in a row?
2014-04-30T14:22:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t remember if i tried that.. i\'ll give it a quick test
2014-04-30T14:23:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers
2014-04-30T14:23:32 <Bosmon> Oh, and you\'ll be glad to know I have a working branch resolving FLUID-4890 and FLUID-5333 .... I\'ll try to deal with my documentation tasks today
2014-04-30T14:23:46 <Bosmon> I see you\'ve been industrious with the various IE8 issues
2014-04-30T14:23:52 <Bosmon> I\'ll take a look at those tomorrow
2014-04-30T14:24:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s awesome
2014-04-30T14:25:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for IE 8 issues.. I\'m going to try to fix the progressiveChecker and uploader issues, if possible. I think those are both just issues with the tests.
2014-04-30T14:26:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for "couldn\'t you just write one fixture after the other - that is, two "listener" records in a row?" do you mean in the same sequence?
2014-04-30T14:26:31 <Justin_o> if so, then i did try that and it didn\'t work.. but i\'ll try again
2014-04-30T14:26:41 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-04-30T14:26:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2014-04-30T14:27:34 <Bosmon> I believe we have a standard $.inArray method to use in any case
2014-04-30T14:34:54 * kasparnet has quit
2014-04-30T14:36:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool, i\'ll try that
2014-04-30T14:36:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: as for the resourceInputPanelTestUtils.. the back to back event listeners in the sequence doesn\'t work
2014-04-30T14:36:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what happens?
2014-04-30T14:36:54 <Justin_o> the test just hangs
2014-04-30T14:37:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what sequence step does it hang at?
2014-04-30T14:37:07 <Justin_o> like it\'s waiting to be started in an async test
2014-04-30T14:39:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it doesn\'t seem to say
2014-04-30T14:39:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - have you included ProgressiveEnhancement.js in the test file?
2014-04-30T14:40:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: which test are we talking about now.. i just want to be sure we are still talking about the same one
2014-04-30T14:41:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the one that is performed by the final stray material in resourceInputPanelTests.js - but I assume you have refactored it into another test in order to make this trial
2014-04-30T14:42:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - btw there is also a typo in that material, for "rsourceInputPanelResources"
2014-04-30T14:47:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i think i\'ve fixed that in the FLOE-171 branch.. anyways.. for the simple test i basically just did a super simple assertion but maybe i missed something.. i\'ll look again.. what was the need for ProgressiveEnhancment.js for
2014-04-30T14:48:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you get the visual diagnostic from the IoC test framework if ProgressiveEnhancement.js is included
2014-04-30T14:48:23 <Bosmon> Which tells you which sequence number it is up to
2014-04-30T14:48:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. let me add that then
2014-04-30T14:49:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: actually we have a custom build of infusion here so it has whatever that has
2014-04-30T14:49:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2014-04-30T14:49:16 <Bosmon> YOu should see the count ticking up in the left part of the QUnit UI then
2014-04-30T14:50:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure i see that, but i get this "Test initial resourceInput panel: Init \xe2\x80\x94 at sequence position 2 of 2" for the test name
2014-04-30T14:51:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2014-04-30T14:51:16 <Bosmon> the "sequence position" number will count up
2014-04-30T14:51:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so that means that the first one ran and it has halted at the second one
2014-04-30T14:51:39 <Justin_o> ?
2014-04-30T14:51:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2014-04-30T14:52:02 <Bosmon> Somewhat puzzling that the sequence has only 2 elements
2014-04-30T14:52:12 <Bosmon> Do you just have 2 elements just for the 2 listeners?
2014-04-30T14:52:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, that\'s sort of what i had expected was happening
2014-04-30T14:52:15 <Justin_o> yep
2014-04-30T14:52:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what happens if you swap the order of the listeners?
2014-04-30T14:54:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it stops at the first one
2014-04-30T14:55:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - fascinating
2014-04-30T14:55:13 <Bosmon> Ok, this might well be a bug in the testing framework
2014-04-30T14:55:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: actually i think i just broke the test with one of my changes..
2014-04-30T14:55:23 <Justin_o> let me double check something
2014-04-30T14:55:24 <Bosmon> So if you swap them, it stucks at "position 1 of 2"?
2014-04-30T14:55:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2014-04-30T15:01:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i think i got things fixed up.. so yes.. stops at position 2 of 2 in the first case
2014-04-30T15:01:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i revers the order it stops at position 3 of 2 and fails on fixture being undefined
2014-04-30T15:01:30 <Bosmon> !
2014-04-30T15:02:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, could you create a branch with that version
2014-04-30T15:02:18 <Bosmon> I\'m just going to write up a JIRA
2014-04-30T15:02:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  sure
2014-04-30T15:05:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/jobara/metadata/tree/FLOE-116-broken-IoCTestingSequence
2014-04-30T15:05:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: now i can\'t remember, was there anything else you needed me to change for FLOE-116 to go in?
2014-04-30T15:08:46 <Bosmon> Thanks Justin_o, I\'ve written up http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5345
2014-04-30T15:09:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you clean up the test a little bit so that at least the configuration forms a grade rather than a standalone function?
2014-04-30T15:10:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: was this the one that is in the FLOE-171 branch or the one that is in the FLOE-116 branch. I could back port that change to if you like.. and help cindy fix the conflict.
2014-04-30T15:11:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think both of them could be rationalised - since even the FLOE-171 version doesn\'t use a grade
2014-04-30T15:13:00 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-04-30T15:13:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2014-04-30T15:13:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way i filed a pull request for the progressiveChecker issue http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5340
2014-04-30T15:13:54 <Justin_o> if you are free now to review it
2014-04-30T15:14:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - great, thanks
2014-04-30T15:14:16 <Bosmon> I\'ll look at it shortly
2014-04-30T15:14:26 <Bosmon> Just as soon as I can discover where I put my IE8 vm :)

2014-04-30T15:16:10 <Bosmon> not yet
2014-04-30T15:23:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s pretty good, I\'ve been using it for all my IE testing recently.. and you can do mac testing there too
