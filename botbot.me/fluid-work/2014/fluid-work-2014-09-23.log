2014-09-23T20:16:10 <anastasiac> danaayotte_, I found this page: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PGA+design but it\xe2\x80\x99s not linked to from the year 1 page - should it be?
2014-09-23T20:18:21 <danaayotte_> anastasiac oh look at that.  hmmmm...yes, I think it should be linked
2014-09-23T20:21:37 <danaayotte_> anastasiac, the page looks great. I cleaned up a few of the links on the Year 1 page. Exploration Tool demo link was broken, and I moved it to the design section (it was under development), also added a Related Work section there
2014-09-23T20:21:58 <danaayotte_> but I see we have the related work page, so maybe we don't need that section on the Year 1 page
2014-09-23T20:22:47 <anastasiac> danaayotte_, not sure about the \xe2\x80\x98related work\xe2\x80\x99 page. I just renamed the Resources page to that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that page. It looks like a hodge-podge. What do you think?
2014-09-23T20:23:20 <danaayotte_> yes, hodgepodge for sure
2014-09-23T20:24:25 <danaayotte_> I wonder if all the links on that page should just be on the new page
2014-09-23T20:24:35 <anastasiac> which new page?
2014-09-23T20:24:53 <danaayotte_> sorry! The new PGA page

2014-09-23T12:36:06 <jhernandez> just a question wrt GPII-772
2014-09-23T12:36:19 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello, good morning
2014-09-23T12:36:33 <jhernandez> hi
2014-09-23T12:37:13 <jhernandez> I was just wondering if mozilla is still offering a way to embed html apps within its gecko engine
2014-09-23T12:37:35 <Justin_o> hmm.. not sure...
2014-09-23T12:37:37 <jhernandez> a few years ago I used mozembed
2014-09-23T12:38:18 <jhernandez> but not sure whether it\'s still alive or they just changed the name
2014-09-23T12:40:23 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-09-23T12:40:50 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks for the tip, i\'ll look into that too
2014-09-23T12:41:15 * cindyli has quit
2014-09-23T12:41:57 <jhernandez> Justin_o: just found http://clintberry.com/2013/html5-apps-desktop-2013/
2014-09-23T12:42:14 <jhernandez> there is a comment:
2014-09-23T12:42:35 <jhernandez> "There are even more ways to package web apps into desktop apps:
2014-09-23T12:42:35 <jhernandez> - Mozilla Chromeless, using Gecko engine, abandoned
2014-09-23T12:42:35 <jhernandez> - Mozilla XULRunner, using Gecko, still active
2014-09-23T12:42:35 <jhernandez> - Open Web Apps, based on Gecko, one app for Firefox OS, Android, Mac OS X, Windows, Linux
2014-09-23T12:42:38 <jhernandez> - JavaFX WebView, using WebKit engine
2014-09-23T12:42:41 <jhernandez> - Adobe AIR StageWebView, using WebKit
2014-09-23T12:42:43 <jhernandez> - Microsoft HTA, using Trident engine, abandoned"
2014-09-23T12:43:12 <jhernandez> JFYI
2014-09-23T12:43:13 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-09-23T12:43:51 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks, even after removing the abandoned ones, there are still several to try out
2014-09-23T12:44:06 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-09-23T12:44:50 <jhernandez> I would say that I prefer those who are gecko-based solutions
2014-09-23T12:45:54 <jhernandez> specially, because orca works better with gecko than webkit
2014-09-23T12:46:06 <Justin_o> ah okay.. i was just going to ask why you prefer it

2014-09-23T12:47:33 <jhernandez> if at the end we\'re going to use a webkit-based solution, we can improve its support in Orca where needed
2014-09-23T12:48:30 <Justin_o> jhernandez: that would be great..
2014-09-23T12:48:51 <Justin_o> i left a comment on the GPII-772 jira with a link to this discussion so that we don\'t lose track of it

2014-09-23T13:32:31 <anastasiac> good morning, jhung. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be looking at the text on the new fluid site. You\xe2\x80\x99re working on the html/css/etc, right? How would you like to coordinate this?
2014-09-23T13:32:41 <anastasiac> Should I just make notes, and edit the files late?
2014-09-23T13:32:50 <anastasiac> or convey changes to you?
2014-09-23T13:33:05 <anastasiac> or branch now, and we can just keep merging each other\xe2\x80\x99s branches in?
2014-09-23T13:33:09 <anastasiac> or some other suggestion?

2014-09-23T17:50:34 <jhung> anastasiac: Sounds reasonable. I\'ll take it out in my next commit.
2014-09-23T17:53:09 <Bosmon7> Hi cindyli - I meant you to remove the entire modelRelay series there
2014-09-23T17:53:12 * michelled has quit
2014-09-23T17:53:14 <Bosmon7> And use just a single free functoin
2014-09-23T17:54:16 <cindyli> Bosmon7: only one single function for multiple targets?
2014-09-23T17:54:22 <Bosmon7> cindyli - yes
2014-09-23T17:54:28 <Bosmon7> All of the model changes are really coordinated
2014-09-23T17:55:13 <cindyli> Bosmon7: so in the function i use that.applier.change() to fire model change events for different targets?
2014-09-23T17:56:17 * michelled joined the channel
2014-09-23T17:56:25 <Bosmon7> cindyli - so there are two problems
2014-09-23T17:56:37 <Bosmon7> Firstly your computation of "isShareTarget" is not model-based
2014-09-23T17:56:53 <Bosmon7> You are passing the wider component {that} to what should simply be a transform
2014-09-23T17:57:18 <Bosmon7> Secondly, all the other transforms seem to take essentially the whole model as argument
2014-09-23T17:57:36 <Bosmon7> So you may as well consolidate them into a single function which just accepts the whole model and returns the whole model
2014-09-23T17:57:46 <cindyli> what\'s the correct way to solve the first problem?
2014-09-23T17:57:59 <cindyli> ok, i see
2014-09-23T17:58:12 <Bosmon7> cindyli - you should be able to write that piece as a listener which then fires applier.change
2014-09-23T17:58:22 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2014-09-23T17:58:35 <Bosmon7> All the rest should just be done at the model level as a relay - it just returns a value and doesn\'t need to use an API
2014-09-23T17:58:58 <Bosmon7> But it\'s certainly looking much cleaner than it used to
2014-09-23T17:59:20 <Bosmon7> It is almost possible to understand what the purpose of the constraint is now, by looking at your relay functions
2014-09-23T18:00:01 <cindyli> lol - almost possible \xe2\x80\xa6
2014-09-23T18:03:40 <Bosmon7> Yes, almost :)

2014-09-23T18:33:14 <anastasiac> nothing major

2014-09-23T18:50:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve got it tracked down a bit further, but it\'s strange.. basically the that.applier.change("isActive", !that.model.isActive); call does nothing
2014-09-23T18:50:41 <Justin_o> and only when you click the match button when the mismatch is open
2014-09-23T18:51:36 <cindyli> umm.. coming
2014-09-23T19:01:15 <jhung> anastasiac: I merged your changes and pushed up my changes too.
2014-09-23T19:01:27 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2014-09-23T19:06:12 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m going to do some testing and validation now, but I hope the structure is more or less stable now.
