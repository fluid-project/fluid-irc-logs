b'2014-07-16T17:13:43 <michelled> next week\'s topics: http://piratepad.net/4pg1lzgDMg
2014-07-16T17:13:51 <michelled> it\'s the second one for next week.
2014-07-16T17:14:02 <slim_> ok thankss for being so organised :)
2014-07-16T17:14:34 <michelled> np :)
2014-07-16T17:14:36 <slim_> As for RFID. I will get my bugs (WIn32) done this week
2014-07-16T17:14:53 <michelled> nice - that will be good prep for the conversation
2014-07-16T17:14:56 <slim_> :)
2014-07-16T17:15:04 <Bosmon> cool slim_
2014-07-16T17:15:21 <slim_> Bosman
2014-07-16T17:15:28 <Bosmon> michelled - do you know if it is ok for us to try to simply delete the old "pilots" branch now?
2014-07-16T17:15:54 <Bosmon> What I am reading suggests that if we do this, a gc process may clean up the remote repo within days/a week
2014-07-16T17:16:44 <slim_> anyone from Crete here who shared apartments?
2014-07-16T17:16:59 <slim_> I want to know the day rate
2014-07-16T17:17:11 <Bosmon> slim_ yes - I\'ll send you what I have
2014-07-16T17:17:31 <slim_> cool
2014-07-16T17:17:48 <slim_> BosMon ===Basman?
2014-07-16T17:18:28 <Bosmon> The day rate was 49E/person/night
2014-07-16T17:18:57 <slim_> Bosmon: TVM. I can do my calcs based on that
2014-07-16T17:19:32 <Bosmon> Sorry, not quite - I meant to say 49E/room/night
2014-07-16T17:19:55 <Bosmon> So your share was 7 * 49 / 3 = 114.3E
2014-07-16T17:20:10 * danaayotte has quit
2014-07-16T17:20:27 <slim_> I figured you meant \'room\'. :) Thanks again
2014-07-16T17:20:35 <Bosmon> I think you handed me 115E in cash
2014-07-16T17:21:38 <slim_> Bosmon: good memory!
2014-07-16T17:22:09 <Bosmon> No, it is written down here on this piece of paper : P
2014-07-16T17:22:25 <Bosmon> Which I still have the task of scanning and entering as a Gogle Docks spreadsheet
2014-07-16T17:22:48 <slim_> Cheat! My mistake was to not write anything down!
2014-07-16T17:23:00 <slim_> Just a scan will do me
2014-07-16T17:23:08 <slim_> Bosmon BTW at ICCHP final keynote you got a name drop from Clayton Lewis for a polemic on flexibility of software :)
2014-07-16T17:23:56 <slim_> Gregg also got a name drop for something. He also mentioned Cloud4All but did not link either of you to it. heh.
2014-07-16T17:24:17 <Bosmon> slim_ - cool - did you go down to France for it?
2014-07-16T17:24:56 <slim_> Yes. Was good. Id SS12 student comp and also got roped in to final Panel by Shadi and did tweeting etc for conf team
2014-07-16T17:25:02 <slim_> was good.
2014-07-16T17:25:59 <Bosmon> nice!
2014-07-16T17:26:21 * slim_ Wife just called to tell me she deleted all files at work so I now have to collect daughter too - must go

2014-07-16T17:54:57 * michelled joined the channel
2014-07-16T17:56:18 <michelled> Bosmon: it\'s perfectly fine to delete that branch
2014-07-16T17:56:39 <michelled> we need to keep the pilots2 branch around for a while
2014-07-16T17:56:53 <michelled> because there is still so much functionality that hash\' trade it to master
2014-07-16T17:57:08 <michelled> that was supposed to be hasn\'t
2014-07-16T18:00:55 * vjoanna has quit
2014-07-16T18:02:00 <Bosmon> michelled - ok - I\'ll push a deletion of that branch then
2014-07-16T18:02:06 <Bosmon> And see if it has any effect within about a week
2014-07-16T18:02:14 <Bosmon> If it doesn\'t, we\'ll have to go for the more aggressive approach
2014-07-16T18:02:36 <michelled> sounds good, thanks
2014-07-16T18:03:23 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-07-16T18:05:18 <Bosmon> ok michelled - I have deleted it
2014-07-16T18:05:32 <michelled> that\'s great!
2014-07-16T18:06:00 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-07-16T18:06:06 <Bosmon> I have to say it has had an enormous and immediate effect
2014-07-16T18:06:16 <michelled> that was my expectation
2014-07-16T18:06:25 <Bosmon> A git clone of universal now took just 2MB and completed in 5 seconds
2014-07-16T18:06:55 <michelled> try doing a fetch of the newly cloned repo
2014-07-16T18:07:37 <Bosmon> Has no effect
2014-07-16T18:07:58 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-07-16T18:09:02 <Bosmon> In any case, it looks like github follows the convention of doing a gc on every commit rather than "every now and then"

2014-07-16T20:03:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m about to run but I had seen this a while back and wonder if it would be useful for kettle instead of express. http://koajs.com I don\'t really know enough of the details of either to know how good or bad it is, so hopefully it won\'t be a complete waste of time.
2014-07-16T20:04:17 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-07-16T20:05:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - given our aim is to avoid exposing primitives from the underlying engine to our users, if we replaced express with this, ideally it would make no difference at all :)

2014-07-16T13:58:48 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-07-16T13:58:59 <clown> I am about to withdraw that pull request, and fix things so it represents the actual file.
2014-07-16T13:59:14 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-16T13:59:15 <jhernandez> clown: no prob
2014-07-16T13:59:35 <jhernandez> looks like you messed with git
2014-07-16T13:59:40 <jhernandez> and git won
2014-07-16T13:59:41 <jhernandez> :P:P
2014-07-16T13:59:47 <clown> github.
2014-07-16T14:00:06 <clown> Everything looks fine on my local copy.  It\'s weird.
2014-07-16T14:00:26 <clown> (although I did find a few extra white spaces this morning, and zapped them).
2014-07-16T14:01:58 <jhernandez> nice
2014-07-16T14:02:38 <jhernandez> btw
2014-07-16T14:02:52 <clown> yes?
2014-07-16T14:02:52 <jhernandez> I gave a quick look at the diff
2014-07-16T14:03:32 <jhernandez> and you\'re not installing tuxguitar
2014-07-16T14:03:38 <jhernandez> but
2014-07-16T14:03:45 <jhernandez> we\'re still removing tuxguitar
2014-07-16T14:03:49 <jhernandez> isn\'t it?
2014-07-16T14:04:03 <clown> I thought I dealt with that, but I could be wrong.  Let me check...
2014-07-16T14:05:03 <jhernandez> https://github.com/klown/linux/blob/device-reporter-draft2/node_modules/packagekit/nodepackagekit/nodepackagekit_test.js#L121
2014-07-16T14:05:33 <clown> jhernandez:  prior to the \'remove\' test is the \'install\' test.  There is a check on the \'install\' test to see if it is already installed.
2014-07-16T14:06:04 <clown> If it isn\'t installed, the install test is run \xe2\x80\xa6 aah I see the problem.  That might fail
2014-07-16T14:06:53 <clown> The logic was:  Either it is already installed, or the install test installed it.  Run the remove test.
2014-07-16T14:07:19 <clown> But, there is a chance the install test will fail, and hence it won\'t be installed.
2014-07-16T14:08:03 <clown> Okay I can put a check on the remove to make sure it\'s installed before trying to remove it.
2014-07-16T14:08:26 <clown> BTW, when a test fails, does jqunit keep running subsequent tests?
2014-07-16T14:10:51 <clown> jhernandez:  github question (if you know):  To keep it clean, I\'ve closed that pull request and deleted my branch.  I hope the next push to gitub will recreate the branch "the right way".  Am I crazy?
2014-07-16T14:10:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking through your comments on the FLOE-198 pull request. Some of these are design issues though.. we\'ll have to talk to the vjoanna and danaayotte about them.
2014-07-16T14:11:11 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2014-07-16T14:14:08 <jhernandez> clown: wrt "remove" - copy that
2014-07-16T14:14:43 <jhernandez> clown: wrt "github" - you\'re not that crazy, things must be fine again
2014-07-16T14:14:53 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-16T14:16:04 <clown> jhernandez, this means I should check each case again \xe2\x80\x94 run with tuxguitar not installed at the start vs. run with it installed from the start.
2014-07-16T14:16:14 <clown> In other words,  this will take a few minutes...
2014-07-16T14:17:23 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-16T14:17:26 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-07-16T14:17:28 <jhernandez> :P

2014-07-16T14:28:31 <Bosmon> Hey there VERNANDEZ
2014-07-16T14:28:55 <Bosmon> jhernandez - after a long investigation which I think still has some hours to go, I\'m increasingly coming to the idea that you broke the Linux acceptance tests yourself : P
2014-07-16T14:31:37 <Bosmon> Can you explain the idea behind this commit - and also where the entries came from?
2014-07-16T14:31:38 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/b240e413f65da15753cdc58fc48db56ea6538867
2014-07-16T14:37:19 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-07-16T14:38:28 <jhernandez> Bosmon: IIRC, those entries are coming from a different pull request
2014-07-16T14:38:45 <jhernandez> but Kasper forgot to add them
2014-07-16T14:38:47 <jhernandez> in any case
2014-07-16T14:38:48 <Bosmon> I\'m wondering in particular about the cursor-size rule
2014-07-16T14:38:55 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-16T14:38:56 <Bosmon> Can you explain what a value of "-1" is to mean?
2014-07-16T14:39:26 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-16T14:39:29 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-07-16T14:40:11 <jhernandez> this comes from the way gnome "understands" cursor sizes when using the default cursor theme
2014-07-16T14:42:06 <jhernandez> -1 is referring to the smallest cursor-size
2014-07-16T14:42:57 <jhernandez> but, tests were running well after that change
2014-07-16T14:43:13 <jhernandez> so, not my fault :P
2014-07-16T14:43:52 <Bosmon> Ok, so -1 is a valid value then?
2014-07-16T14:43:56 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-16T14:44:03 <jhernandez> that\'s correct
2014-07-16T14:45:19 <jhernandez> unless we were living a lie
2014-07-16T14:45:23 <Bosmon> Well ok
2014-07-16T14:45:24 <jhernandez> let me check it
2014-07-16T14:45:26 <jhernandez> just a secondd
2014-07-16T14:45:35 <Bosmon> It seems like it is not a race condition at all, but some kind of real bug
2014-07-16T14:45:41 <Bosmon> That is, a deterministic bug : P
2014-07-16T14:46:15 <Bosmon> If this solutions entry is correct, then the problem lies somewhere in transformation and matchmaking....
2014-07-16T14:46:47 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-16T14:46:50 <jhernandez> just checked
2014-07-16T14:46:59 <jhernandez> and it\'s still a valid value
2014-07-16T14:47:09 <jhernandez> gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size
2014-07-16T14:47:10 <jhernandez> 24
2014-07-16T14:47:27 <jhernandez> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size -1
2014-07-16T14:47:40 <jhernandez> gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size
2014-07-16T14:47:40 <jhernandez> -1
2014-07-16T14:48:05 <Bosmon> ok, thanks
2014-07-16T14:49:29 <jhernandez> is that -1 disturbing at any component/piece of code?
2014-07-16T14:49:50 <Bosmon> Well, it is one of the improper values which is sent to the settings handler during the failing test
2014-07-16T14:50:05 <Bosmon> But if the value itself is valid, the problem must lie further back
2014-07-16T14:50:13 <Bosmon> But to be honest I don\'t understand what this test is testing at all
2014-07-16T14:51:56 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-07-16T14:52:06 <jhernandez> which test? the broken one?
2014-07-16T14:59:33 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-07-16T14:59:45 <Bosmon> The "expected" settings payload seems completely nonsensical to me
2014-07-16T15:01:23 <Justin_o> vjoanna, danaayotte: do you have time to look over the interaction of the feedback tool demo with UI Options with me?
2014-07-16T15:01:47 <danaayotte> sure Justin_o
2014-07-16T15:02:03 <Justin_o> danaayotte: thanks
2014-07-16T15:02:04 <vjoanna> justin_o yes
