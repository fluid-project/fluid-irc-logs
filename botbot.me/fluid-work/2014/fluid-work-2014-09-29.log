2014-09-29T12:58:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s for using kettle to serve the PMT/PCP

2014-09-29T13:32:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I hope not : P
2014-09-29T13:32:55 <Bosmon> Oh yes, good
2014-09-29T13:33:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: It looked pretty minimal.. i think it should be okay
2014-09-29T13:33:49 <Bosmon> Yes, seems reasonable enough
2014-09-29T13:34:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.
2014-09-29T13:43:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m writing up the modularization proposal now.. I have a question about our "common builds" though
2014-09-29T13:44:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are we expecting the 3rd party dependencies to be included in there?
2014-09-29T13:44:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: meaning.. should the infusion-all build contain jQuery for example
2014-09-29T13:45:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: bower should be pulling in these dependencies for the user, but they would have to link them in directly if they aren\'t included in infusion.

2014-09-29T14:26:38 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2014-09-29T14:26:42 <Bosmon> I guess I\'m not sure about that
2014-09-29T14:26:50 <Bosmon> But it sounds like the kind of thing we might want variant builds for
2014-09-29T14:27:14 <Bosmon> One of the advantages of having an artifact just with builds is that we don\'t "waste space" in our main repo by having several different variants
2014-09-29T14:27:33 <Bosmon> So I imagine we might want infusion-all, and infusion-all-no-jquery etc.
2014-09-29T14:27:47 <Bosmon> That\'s just a guess, it\'s the kind of thing we would want to discuss on list
2014-09-29T14:30:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll add that as a question in my proposal, thanks
2014-09-29T14:37:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sent the proposal, feel free to comment on it
2014-09-29T14:37:52 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o

2014-09-29T17:32:33 <cindyli> good finding, Justin_o
2014-09-29T17:34:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: can you update pouchdb in your current branch.. i wonder if it may help the aboutError too
2014-09-29T17:34:18 <Justin_o> it\'s doubtful, but it would be worth trying since we need to update anyways
2014-09-29T17:34:47 <cindyli> agree. i will do that, Justin_o
