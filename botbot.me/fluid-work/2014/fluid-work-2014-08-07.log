2014-08-07T13:05:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a recommended way to have a modelListener that doesn\'t fire on the initial change.. currently it is being done by doing a later binding to the event fired from the changeApplier

2014-08-07T13:13:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: Bosmon made a pull request for the pager migration docs, would you be able to review that https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/25
2014-08-07T13:13:58 <anastasiac> will do, Justin_o and Bosmon, thanks

2014-08-07T13:58:30 <Bosmon> anastasiac - it seems that our DOM Binder page, one of the most important, seems to have fallen between the cracks of our conversion effort
2014-08-07T13:58:37 <Bosmon> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/DOM+Binder
2014-08-07T13:58:42 <Bosmon> Is it on our conversion roadmap anywhere?
2014-08-07T13:59:33 <anastasiac> Yes, Bosmon, Justin_o and I talked about that yesterday and identified it as something we need to move. It\'s now on the docs planning page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation+Plan and there\'s a JIRA for it http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5486
2014-08-07T13:59:40 <Bosmon> anastasiac - great
2014-08-07T13:59:57 <colinclark> THE DOM BINDER
2014-08-07T14:00:00 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I was planning to look it over and try to address your concerns about it being confusing before we port it to Markdown
2014-08-07T14:00:08 <colinclark> One of our oldest APIs, but still so relevant!
2014-08-07T14:01:53 <Bosmon> We should try to convert some version of it quite soon since the-t-in-rtf is having problems using the DOM binder
2014-08-07T14:02:03 <Bosmon> And it is almost the first thing that any user of the framework tries
2014-08-07T14:02:59 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I\'ll have a look at it today.
2014-08-07T14:40:45 <amilchev> kasparnet this is the data that populates PCP in my branch right now https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-543/demos/prefsEditor/pcp.html#L117-L142
2014-08-07T14:41:47 <amilchev> if the MM team can construct such prefs set (or something similar if necessary), that\'d be ok from PCP side
2014-08-07T14:41:57 <amilchev> don\'t know if this became clear..
2014-08-07T14:42:44 <amilchev> there is some refactoring that needs to be done in my branch before it\'s ready for pull request, but it\'s functioning for now
2014-08-07T14:43:48 <amilchev> by functioning I mean "showing only necessary adjusters basing on the prefs set and setting their values, thus making websocket calls to the FM with its model to actually apply the settings on the machine"
2014-08-07T14:45:44 <amilchev> this is the branch gpii-543 - it will be merged after branch gpii-838 (instant webcosket calls without need of button but just on adjuster change), which will be merged after the websocket pull (https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/66), which will be merged after the universal pull in LM (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/251)
2014-08-07T14:50:13 <amilchev> kasparnet tell me if I\'m somehow rolling away from what other people in the team are expecting (this is quite possible since I\'ve made many decisions on my own)

2014-08-07T17:25:51 <Bosmon> Hi anastasiac - I updated my pager migration tutorial based on your comments
2014-08-07T17:26:18 <anastasiac> Thanks, Bosmon, I\'ll have a look
2014-08-07T17:33:25 * michelled joined the channel
2014-08-07T17:43:54 <jhung> anastasiac: Do you want to do the merge for FLUID-5477 since you have it already on your machine?
2014-08-07T17:44:07 <anastasiac> ah, right jhung, good point
2014-08-07T17:48:46 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'ve merged,  and issued a new pull request for the UIO upgrade, FLUID-5471. Could you do a code review on the changes in the skins folder? You might have to do it on the command line, since too many files have changed for github to want to do it :-)
2014-08-07T17:49:09 <jhung> ok. I\'ll take a look at that anastasiac

2014-08-07T19:07:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to use the modelListeners, but not have it fire on the initial setting of the model, example through a relay
2014-08-07T19:10:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not any more, no
2014-08-07T19:10:17 <Bosmon> What kind of problem is it causing?
2014-08-07T19:11:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there\'s a case in the PMT or PCP that it could be useful.. i\'m also trying to track down an issue with the feedback tool and it\'s just adding some debugging noise.
2014-08-07T19:12:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s a bit of a reference to the one in PMT/PCP that i was mentioning https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/71#discussion_r15869558
2014-08-07T19:13:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, this listener binding should definitely appear in the modelListeners block
2014-08-07T19:13:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the problem is that he doesn\'t want it to trigger on the first model change since this is just a relay of the model value i think
2014-08-07T19:16:30 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-07T19:17:29 <Bosmon> His current implementation plus comment is reasonable then
2014-08-07T19:18:27 <Bosmon> It seems that we might have to bring back the "source" system that we used to have in the old ChangeApplier
2014-08-07T19:19:26 <Bosmon> I was waiting to see if a use case for it would reappear
2014-08-07T19:22:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. cool that would help, i think we will have some cases like this, although rare.
2014-08-07T19:25:02 <Bosmon> The main uses of "source" were to prevent "backwash"
2014-08-07T19:25:05 <Bosmon> In the old days
2014-08-07T19:25:16 <Bosmon> Which today we can deal with through our improved "unchanged value detection"
2014-08-07T19:25:35 <Bosmon> But I think there are some other cases, such as this one, where it is still important to be able to identify what the source of a change is
2014-08-07T19:28:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. that all sounds true..

2014-08-07T19:32:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how does fluid.globalDismissal get unbound
2014-08-07T19:32:34 <Justin_o> i think it might be firing twice in my test case.. but it seems to only be an issue here.. in the IoCTesting framework.. the test had worked before in the standard style of test
2014-08-07T19:32:44 <Justin_o> and it seems to work in the demo as well
2014-08-07T19:35:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it unbound every time it fires
2014-08-07T19:35:32 * cindyli has quit
2014-08-07T19:35:33 <Bosmon> Or if you unbind it manually
2014-08-07T19:35:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how do you do that manually
2014-08-07T19:35:47 <Justin_o> ?
2014-08-07T19:36:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you call it with the same DOM node you did before, but with null as the 2nd argument
2014-08-07T19:37:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we tried that, but it gave an error about the nodes
2014-08-07T19:38:09 * michelled joined the channel
2014-08-07T19:39:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. that worked now.. thanks
2014-08-07T19:39:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe the autounbinding wasn\'t working
2014-08-07T19:40:28 <Justin_o> i wonder if it was an issue with the simulated click
