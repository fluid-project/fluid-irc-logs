2014-06-16T14:05:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve left some comments on a few

2014-06-16T14:35:24 <Justin_o> clown: is there aria appropriate for a form field that is autocorrected if an invalid value is inputted.. for example a the text field takes number in a certain range.. if you enter something out of the range, the value will changed to the closest valid value.
2014-06-16T14:36:05 <clown> Justin_o: just a second (or rather five minutes or so).

2014-06-16T14:51:34 <Justin_o> clown: also, how does the progressbar role work.. does the progress bar itself need to have focus for the announcements to be reported.. or should it interrupt like other live regions?
2014-06-16T14:55:39 * cindyli has quit
2014-06-16T15:04:15 <clown> Justin-o: quick anwer for progressbar:  no, you shouldn\'t need focus (although focus won\'t hurt).  Should have aria-busy="true" while loading.  I\'d also try aria-live=\'polite\' if you need it to announce when not focussed.

2014-06-16T15:11:09 <clown> Justin_o:  regarding autocorrect:  there is nothing in the aria spec to handle that.  The only thing that comes close is aria-invalid (true/false).
2014-06-16T15:15:18 <Justin_o> clown: okay thanks.. i wonder if that would work for our case since it doesn\'t leave the value invalid

2014-06-16T18:38:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: left you a comment on your pull request

2014-06-16T18:44:50 <jhung> Hello Bosmon.
2014-06-16T18:45:56 <Bosmon> Hi there jhung
2014-06-16T18:46:48 * clown_mtg has quit
2014-06-16T18:46:57 <jhung> I was going to start looking into templating in Docpad. I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a templating?
2014-06-16T18:53:37 * clown joined the channel
2014-06-16T18:59:41 <Bosmon> jhung - I think we had considered that the templating engines we had found were mostly equally bad : P
2014-06-16T18:59:46 <Bosmon> Although I guess some of them are particularly bad
2014-06-16T18:59:58 * michelled has quit
2014-06-16T18:59:59 <Bosmon> Handlebars seemed like a reasonable choice for something that was only "middle of the road bad"
2014-06-16T19:00:06 <Bosmon> As well as having broad support
2014-06-16T19:00:57 <jhung> I\'m quite okay with "middle of the road bad" if others find being in such a state acceptable Bosmon.
2014-06-16T19:01:45 <Bosmon> Well, we don\'t have much choice - our own templating engine will probably not be ready until 2016 : P

2014-06-16T19:27:28 <jhernandez> hopefully, I\'ll finish with android ones too by today/tomorrow
2014-06-16T19:27:29 <jhernandez> :)
2014-06-16T19:29:54 <clown> good luck, jhernandez.
2014-06-16T19:30:29 <cindyli> Justin_o: ur pull request for 5433 has been merged into the project repo
2014-06-16T19:40:13 <clown> Justin_o: This one works with orca:  http://www.oaa-accessibility.org/example/27/
2014-06-16T19:40:48 <clown> one odd thing:  there doesn\'t appear to be any aria-live attribute for that one.
2014-06-16T19:41:35 <clown> Justin_o:  point of clarification orca and FF 29.0.1

2014-06-16T20:18:42 <Justin_o> clown: could you please try this example out http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/progress/
2014-06-16T20:18:56 <Justin_o> clown: by the way the example you sent doesn\'t work in safari with voiceover
2014-06-16T20:20:21 <Justin_o> or firefox with voiceover for that matter
2014-06-16T20:24:05 <Justin_o> clown: your example works with NVDA
2014-06-16T20:24:38 <clown> Justin_o:  well, not really "my" example, credit goes to Jon Gunderson.
2014-06-16T20:24:48 <Justin_o> clown: :)
2014-06-16T20:26:51 <clown> Justin_o:  your example sort of works with orca/FF.  The "x % complete"  speeches are way behind the actual per cent complete.
2014-06-16T20:27:31 <Justin_o> okay.. cool.. so it\'s announcing something at least.. in IE and NVDA it would give the changing pitch
