b'2014-03-17T19:30:26 <clown> so, I shouldn\'t be tracking your "old" packagekitBridge branch
2014-03-17T19:30:27 <clown> ?
2014-03-17T19:30:50 * clown we are slowly becoming "main stream".
2014-03-17T19:33:19 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-17T19:33:43 <clown> jhernandez, does you packagekitBridge branch still exist?
2014-03-17T19:34:05 <clown> no wait, I misunderstood.
2014-03-17T19:34:13 <jhernandez> oh yes, it was me
2014-03-17T19:34:32 <jhernandez> s/packageKit/packageKitBridge
2014-03-17T19:34:34 <jhernandez> sorry
2014-03-17T19:34:35 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-17T19:34:38 <clown> you\'ve updated your packagekitBridge, pulling from master
2014-03-17T19:34:49 <jhernandez> that\'s it
2014-03-17T19:34:51 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-17T19:35:01 <clown> not:  you\'ve committed packageKitBridge to master.
2014-03-17T19:35:08 <jhernandez> heh
2014-03-17T19:35:09 <jhernandez> no
2014-03-17T19:35:20 <clown> right, I\'ll go update everything now (git is fun!)
2014-03-17T19:35:44 <jhernandez> but I had to do that in order to merge it into another one
2014-03-17T19:35:45 <Justin_o> alexeiTruhin: probably a broader search would be better.. so something like google makes sense. However it should ultimately be configurable.
2014-03-17T19:36:12 <clown> "merge it into another one", jhernandez? Which one?
2014-03-17T19:36:41 <jhernandez> clown: it\'s local right now
2014-03-17T19:36:49 <clown> oh, okay.
2014-03-17T19:36:53 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-17T19:37:43 <clown> btw, I\'ve made changes to the packagekitBridge, but I\'m not ready to push them yet (not sure if they are right).  Like you, that\'s on a local branch.
2014-03-17T19:37:55 <jhernandez> ok
2014-03-17T19:39:28 <jhernandez> be sure to add --rebase when updating your branch, or just stash them, before pulling the new git history
2014-03-17T19:39:51 <clown> sure.  I *always* do a "git pull \xe2\x80\x94rebase".
2014-03-17T19:39:59 <jhernandez> --rebase if you already have a commit of them - stash if you didn\'t commit them
2014-03-17T19:40:05 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-17T19:41:00 * kasparnet has quit
2014-03-17T19:41:27 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-03-17T19:42:05 <clown> jhernandez:  git is echo\'ing you:  "Cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.  Please commit or stash them"  :-D
2014-03-17T19:45:18 <jhung1> Justin_o: I replied to your comment in FLOE-175. http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-175#comment-24314

2014-03-17T15:33:07 <alexeiTruhin> does there exist already a project "dictionary"? because it\'s written about expanding, but I couldn\'t find this project

2014-03-17T18:59:22 <cindyli> good to see you
2014-03-17T18:59:47 <Bosmon7> Did you check your issue against kasparnet\'s fix for FLUID-5251?
2014-03-17T19:00:01 <cindyli> no. let me check
2014-03-17T19:00:29 <Bosmon7> I noticed you closed your pull request already
2014-03-17T19:00:38 <Bosmon7> Are you going to issue a new pull?
2014-03-17T19:08:34 * SonicX has quit
2014-03-17T19:14:09 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon7, already issued a new pull, but going to close it again since kasparnet\'s fix for FLUID-5251 seems also working for this one. thanks for pointing me there, Bosmon7
2014-03-17T19:15:17 <Bosmon7> cindyli - great
2014-03-17T19:21:48 <cindyli> Bosmon7: any idea when kasparnet\'s pull will get into the master? i\'m asking because the metadata demo needs both your relay pull and this pull. certainly i can manually merge these branches before building infusion but not ideal to keep track of all these.
2014-03-17T19:23:03 <Bosmon7> cindyli - if we are lucky, it might get in today
2014-03-17T19:23:12 <cindyli> YAY!!
