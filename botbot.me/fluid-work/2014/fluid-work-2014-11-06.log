2014-11-06T23:54:43 <Bosmon> Because **YOU** are responssible for fixing it!!!
2014-11-06T23:54:58 <Bosmon> It was assigned to you by a .... **BELARRUSSIAN**
2014-11-06T23:55:08 <Bosmon> Over TEN MONTHS AGO
2014-11-06T23:55:33 <jhernandez> yes, but it's the first notice I have of it
2014-11-06T23:57:50 <jhernandez> in any case, I'm pretty lost about it - that belorrussian never talked me about this
2014-11-06T23:57:59 <Bosmon> He should be blamed
2014-11-06T23:59:24 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-06T23:59:37 <jhernandez> I agree with you

b'2014-11-06T16:31:20 <Justin_o> a very small viewport. Since most of our demos aren\'t made for mobile, they don\'t look / behave well. I think it might make sense to just leave everything at the desktop resolution and have mobile users manually zoom in.
2014-11-06T16:31:24 <Justin_o> any thoughts?

2014-11-06T20:22:21 <anastasiac> jhung, could you remind me of the status of FLUID-5451? Are you waiting on a review from me, or am I waiting on updates from you? :-)
2014-11-06T20:23:23 <jhung> anastasiac FLUID-5451 is waiting comments.
2014-11-06T20:23:36 <anastasiac> okley; sorry about that!
2014-11-06T20:23:55 <jhung> No sorry, I thought I mentioned I updated it, but I think I only mentioned the build site.
2014-11-06T20:25:00 <anastasiac> you probably did mention, I\xe2\x80\x99m just juggling a bit, and dropping some things occasionally
2014-11-06T20:27:23 <jhung> no worries anastasiac. I\'m back on trying to figure out the Phet sim anyway.
2014-11-06T20:54:46 <jhung> anastasiac: so I did some looking into the accessibility issue on the Phet sim. It seems the grunt build does not add keyboard accessibility. But if I load the sim from the non-built version, it seems to work.
2014-11-06T20:55:02 <anastasiac> interesting
2014-11-06T20:55:43 <jhung> I\'m going to do a quick look at their grunt file to see if there\'s anything obvious. I may need Justin_o\'s help if it\'s not clear. (Their grunt file is massive)
2014-11-06T20:55:48 <jhung> ^anastasiac
2014-11-06T20:56:13 <anastasiac> jhung, michelled: I just merged the fluidproject.org stuff into master. Nice work, jhung! Now, we just need to get the site deployed to production. jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing you can work with avtar on that?
2014-11-06T20:56:57 <jhung> excellent anastasiac! I\'ll follow up with avtar to get it online.
2014-11-06T20:58:37 <anastasiac> and jhung, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw: I had two more comments on the build site pull request; tiny things
2014-11-06T20:58:44 <anastasiac> almost there!!
2014-11-06T20:59:12 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ll take a look. :)

2014-11-06T21:10:34 <Bosmon> simonjb - some good news
2014-11-06T21:10:49 <Bosmon> I have now finally succeeded in merging up my giant branch with your GPII-94 work
2014-11-06T21:10:51 <Bosmon> After all this time
2014-11-06T21:11:03 <Bosmon> And I have run our acceptance tests 6 times in a row and they have passed completely each time
2014-11-06T21:11:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: AWESOME!!!
2014-11-06T21:11:17 <Bosmon> Also I have tested with the very latest node.js version 0.10.33 and it also works fine
2014-11-06T21:11:25 * kasparne_ has quit
2014-11-06T21:11:32 <simonjb> Bosmon: oh, that\'s great
2014-11-06T21:11:38 <Bosmon> However there is some somewhat mysterious news that in these test runs, none of the new retrying logic that I implemented appears to execute at all
2014-11-06T21:11:53 <Bosmon> That is, there were no instances where Windows mysteriously reported settings which differed from those that were set
2014-11-06T21:12:03 <Bosmon> Perhaps the mere THREAT of executing the code was sufficient to make Windows behave
2014-11-06T21:13:09 <Bosmon> All the same, I think it is pretty likely that we are on the verge of finally opening up our projects with up-to-date versions of Node again
2014-11-06T21:13:31 <Bosmon> I\'ll get some food and then I\'ll turn to updating the linux repo now ....
2014-11-06T21:13:36 <simonjb> that is really great news

2014-11-06T21:44:46 <jhung> anastasiac: I pushed changes to the build site pull request.
2014-11-06T21:45:03 <jhernandez> probably, I\'ll do a little bit of coding before going to bed
2014-11-06T21:45:09 <anastasiac> k, thanks jhung
2014-11-06T21:45:16 <jhung> I\'ll file a jira against UIO about the border disappearing when drop shadow is removed from the button anastasiac
2014-11-06T21:45:25 <jhung> but I fixed it for the build site.
2014-11-06T21:45:58 <jhernandez> I\'ll try to push my work on orca ASAP

2014-11-06T23:43:04 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-11-06T23:43:21 <jhernandez> quick question
2014-11-06T23:43:43 * kasparnet has quit
2014-11-06T23:43:49 <jhernandez> are tests in universal passing right now?
2014-11-06T23:44:01 <Bosmon> jhernandez - what do you mean "right now"?
2014-11-06T23:44:06 <Bosmon> There have been no commits to universal for 4 months
2014-11-06T23:44:14 <Bosmon> And they were certainly passing then!
2014-11-06T23:44:52 <jhernandez> I mean
2014-11-06T23:44:56 <jhernandez> by using your branch
2014-11-06T23:45:01 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-11-06T23:45:05 <Bosmon> They are passing there too
2014-11-06T23:45:06 <jhernandez> and yes
2014-11-06T23:45:08 <jhernandez> they\'re passing
2014-11-06T23:46:24 <jhernandez> *but*, had to comment the windows-related offending line at tests/IntegrationTests.js
2014-11-06T23:46:43 <Bosmon> jhernandez - what do you mean?
2014-11-06T23:46:55 <Bosmon> I cannot imagine what you mean by "windows-related offending line" : P
2014-11-06T23:47:20 <jhernandez> xD
2014-11-06T23:47:39 <jhernandez> look, I\'m getting an error when running IntegrationTests.js
2014-11-06T23:47:56 <jhernandez> and I\'m getting this error

2014-11-06T23:49:13 <Bosmon> Of the "common full traceback"
2014-11-06T23:49:17 <jhernandez> heh
2014-11-06T23:49:25 <Bosmon> LOOK, I\'m asking you for the line number : P

2014-11-06T23:50:33 <Bosmon> aaaah
2014-11-06T23:50:35 <Bosmon> THAT error
2014-11-06T23:50:46 <Bosmon> This is all KASPPPARNETT\'s DIRTY WORK :)
2014-11-06T23:50:51 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2014-11-06T23:51:02 <jhernandez> do you want me to provide a patch for it?
2014-11-06T23:51:15 <Bosmon> please
2014-11-06T23:51:21 <Bosmon> How will this patch work?
2014-11-06T23:52:02 <jhernandez> I guess that os.platform can do the trick, isn\'t it?
2014-11-06T23:52:13 <Bosmon> jhernandez - VRONGG!
2014-11-06T23:52:15 <Bosmon> These tests must RUN!
2014-11-06T23:52:20 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-06T23:52:29 <jhernandez> so they\'re supposed to be running
2014-11-06T23:52:30 <jhernandez> ok ok

2014-11-06T23:52:48 <jhernandez> didn\'t dive into the problem

2014-11-06T13:57:59 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - so, could you give an example of one of the specific operations that the queues have to perform, and we can talk through how it would be implemented in the "data structure only" implementation model?
2014-11-06T13:58:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, i appreciate that.. also i\'m almost finished fixing up your other comments, but i\'ll have to adjust some of the tests so i\'ll push that up afterwards.
2014-11-06T13:59:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the queue keeps track of the isActive state to know when a request is actually being processed.
2014-11-06T13:59:39 <Justin_o> That\'s probably the biggest part, and to know when to trigger the next item in the queue
2014-11-06T14:00:02 <Bosmon> I was also going to recommend dropping the "onDropped" event (ho, ho!) since I don\'t think it will be of particular interest to any clients we can think of right now
2014-11-06T14:00:15 <Justin_o> which happens either when an item is added to an empty queue and nothing is currently running, and when a request finishes running and there are items in the queue
2014-11-06T14:01:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - all of these cases, I believe, can be dealt with by just queuing a callback for which the hash of the queue it needs to operate on appears in its argument list
2014-11-06T14:01:29 <Bosmon> The "glorious arg-ism of the 70s", I think it has been called : P
2014-11-06T14:01:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2014-11-06T14:02:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the queues themselves would have to maintain an isActive state then
2014-11-06T14:02:16 <Justin_o> to handle the case where something is added to an empty queue
2014-11-06T14:02:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - certainly an isActive flag would be stored in their structures, yes
2014-11-06T14:02:33 <Bosmon> The idea is that all of the STATE that they require appear in their data structures
2014-11-06T14:02:42 <Bosmon> but all the BEHAVIOUR is moved up into the parent component
2014-11-06T14:03:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the structure would look like {directModelHash: {isActive: state, queue: [}} is that correct?
2014-11-06T14:03:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - something like that, yes
2014-11-06T14:03:22 <Bosmon> With additional fields for whatever bookkeeping we discover we require in there
2014-11-06T14:03:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: meaning if i come across something else as i try to implement it
2014-11-06T14:04:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - exactly
2014-11-06T14:05:11 <Bosmon> This may all seem a bit peculiar, given the set of values we\'ve articulated as underlying the framework
2014-11-06T14:05:21 <Bosmon> But it has to be borne in mind that the framework isn\'t necessarily appropriate for every purpose
2014-11-06T14:05:38 <Bosmon> And in particular, one of the purposes the framework isn\'t good for, is for implementing the framework itself : P
2014-11-06T14:05:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i see.. that\'s a good point
2014-11-06T14:06:00 <Bosmon> In the very early days I tried some approaches based on making the framework itself IoC-driven and quickly learned not to try that again :)
2014-11-06T14:06:37 <Bosmon> In particular, there are very strong performance arguments for making low-level parts of the framework as "arg-ist" as possible
2014-11-06T14:06:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think we need to do a better job of keeping track of best practices and etc. we had a made a list on the wiki  but it\'s probably way out of date at this point.
2014-11-06T14:06:47 <Bosmon> Not all of the framework has been updated in the face of this realisation
2014-11-06T14:06:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it would be helpful for maintaining code consistency and ramping others up on using infusion
2014-11-06T14:07:14 <Bosmon> but once we read a little more in the last year about how the very high-performance newer JS optimisers work, we found that they will respond the very best to code which is highly arg-ist
2014-11-06T14:07:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. that\'s very reasonable...
2014-11-06T14:07:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think i remember you mentioning that before..
2014-11-06T14:07:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, for others using infusion, we expect them to mostly use the framework, rather than work on it - but I agree that a best practices page could helpfully highlight which purposes we consider the framework good for
2014-11-06T14:08:10 <Bosmon> The goal of the framework is to assist the writing of what could be called "user code"
2014-11-06T14:08:24 <Bosmon> That is, code which directly interacts with a real human user to assist them with some goal they want to achieve
2014-11-06T14:08:44 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-11-06T14:08:51 <Bosmon> This could be contrasted, for example, with other kinds of goals such as writing, e.g. "systems code", or "algorithmic/numerical code" etc.
2014-11-06T14:09:02 <Bosmon> These are kinds of purposes the framework is not good for
2014-11-06T14:09:12 <Bosmon> And the framework itself falls somewhere in amongst those kinds of categories
2014-11-06T14:09:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah.. i understand what you mean now
2014-11-06T14:09:41 <Bosmon> sbates observed at some point that over time, the framework will increasingly come to take on the functions of what people typically call "compilers" or "interpreters"
2014-11-06T14:09:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the framework is more of UI framework of sorts where the UI may or may not have a GUI.. is that correct
2014-11-06T14:10:12 <Bosmon> Yes - it\'s in general a "little" broader than being aimed at something with a UI specifically - but yes, that broadly covers the terrain
2014-11-06T14:10:41 <Bosmon> Especially given that some kinds of writers are fond of describing the github command line as a "UI" you could say that it exactly covers it : P
2014-11-06T14:10:47 <Bosmon> But I generally consider these kinds of writers perverse
2014-11-06T14:11:03 <Justin_o> haha
2014-11-06T14:11:20 <Bosmon> But yes, in general we want to absolutely minimise the number of Infusion components that the framework spontaneously creates for its own bookkeeping purposes
2014-11-06T14:11:52 <Bosmon> As well as being very inefficient, these will create a debugging nightmare even AFTER we have implemented our long-heralded framework debugging tools
2014-11-06T14:12:19 <Justin_o> any ETA on those debugging tools?
2014-11-06T14:12:19 <Bosmon> Since without some other kind of assistance, the user will become hopelessly confused between which components they have created themselves for their work, and which components the framework has spontaneously created on their behalf
2014-11-06T14:12:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, you can see our current workload
2014-11-06T14:12:48 <Justin_o> yah.. that\'s true.. the prefsFramework is pretty confusing in this manner at the moment
2014-11-06T14:12:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :(
2014-11-06T14:12:57 <Bosmon> Right now we can\'t even afford any non-GPII driven Infusion work at all
2014-11-06T14:13:17 <Bosmon> Hopefully this crush will ease off after the EU review in January
2014-11-06T14:14:04 <Bosmon> But yes, I remember the time I tried to use demands blocks to guide the framework\'s resolution of where IoC records were kept for the current stack frame or component
2014-11-06T14:14:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully.. I\'ve been thinking that we should hold off on a 2.0 release till after some better debugging supports are implemented.. but those are only preliminary thoughts at the moment
2014-11-06T14:14:22 <Bosmon> It became entirely impossible to debug the IoC system at all since it would just keep spontaneously reactivating itself : P
2014-11-06T14:14:47 <Justin_o> lol
2014-11-06T14:15:02 <Bosmon> If you consider how hard it is to debug the current system that has already had several months of work put into it specifically to make it easier to debug ...........
2014-11-06T14:15:38 <Bosmon> Perhaps you remember the time when our stack frames were all about 3x as deep as they currently are, because of the universal use of fluid.tryCatch before any dispatch into the framework............
2014-11-06T14:16:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: definitely the logging has been much improved :)
2014-11-06T14:16:30 <Bosmon> You may view a stack frame 90 levels deep as not meaningfully deeper than one that is only 30 levels deep, but I can insist the difference is still meaningful :)
2014-11-06T14:17:33 <Justin_o> I think most of the issues i typically run into are easily understandable by the console logs
2014-11-06T14:17:43 <Bosmon> Things are getting better, certainly
2014-11-06T14:17:47 <Bosmon> kasparne_ ran into a horrible issue last night
2014-11-06T14:17:57 <Bosmon> Which thankfully ended up being caused by a framework bug
2014-11-06T14:18:16 <Bosmon> Since really we aim for any situation which *isn\'t* caused by a framework bug to be fully intelligible from the logs
2014-11-06T14:19:01 <Bosmon> I filed http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5546 for it, which we also don\'t have time to address right now
2014-11-06T14:19:13 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-11-06T14:19:43 <Bosmon> So do be aware of it as an annoying framework pothole - if you inject an event into another component, and that component declaratively registers a listener for the injected event, and that component is then destroyed, the listener won\'t be cleaned up
2014-11-06T14:20:26 <Bosmon> The framework will at least give you a half-intelligible diagnostic, saying "This argument can\'t be resolved for component xxxx which has been destroyed"
2014-11-06T14:20:48 <Bosmon> But it won\'t be clear why it is actually trying to resolve the argument at all
2014-11-06T14:21:00 <Bosmon> This bug was introduced around February I believe

2014-11-06T14:34:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i might have hit that before.. I\'ve had a few issues recently ( probably with feedback ) where we\'d get logs like that
2014-11-06T14:34:38 <Justin_o> i can\'t remember now what the work around was, or it was just an implementation error anyways
2014-11-06T14:38:23 * anvk joined the channel
2014-11-06T14:40:36 <Bosmon> The workaround is to just leave the event where it is, and inject the listener to it directly
2014-11-06T14:40:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how does that work?
2014-11-06T14:41:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh i see
2014-11-06T14:41:20 <Justin_o> do the declaration the other way
2014-11-06T14:41:34 <Bosmon> Right
2014-11-06T14:41:45 <Bosmon> You can always write {otherComponent}.events.event as a listener key
2014-11-06T14:41:59 <Bosmon> Even if it can lead to a somewhat less clear design
2014-11-06T14:43:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: good to know that that would work..
2014-11-06T14:43:15 <Justin_o> i would have thought the framework process for wiring them up would have been similar
2014-11-06T14:43:38 <Bosmon> Well, unfortunately this all stems from a stupid optimisation I put in, during the "afterDestroy" work
2014-11-06T14:44:11 <Bosmon> The framework doesn\'t bother to take note of any listeners a component registers against its "own" events - because it assumes that the events will be destroyed along with the listeners when the component dies
2014-11-06T14:44:25 <Bosmon> Unfortunately this isn\'t the case if the event itself was injected from elsewhere
2014-11-06T14:45:52 <Justin_o> ah i see
2014-11-06T14:48:13 <jhung> anastasiac: regarding the missing fonts in the build site. The headers for each component and test should be roboto slab. If you\'re using FF, you may have to restart the browser because of font changes. It should look fine in webkit.

However, applying this to the demos is a bit more of an issue. In order for the media query to kick in the phone has to be instructed to use it\'s actual resolution. However this means that the demos themselves are in
