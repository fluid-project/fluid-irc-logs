2014-02-07T22:51:14 <Bosmon> michelled - which one?
2014-02-07T22:51:43 <michelled> src/demos/inlineEdit/simple/demo.html
2014-02-07T22:51:58 <michelled> hovering over the inline edit with the mouse only sometimes shows me a tooltip
2014-02-07T22:53:07 <michelled> actually, with keyboard focus too
2014-02-07T22:53:09 <michelled> this is in FF
2014-02-07T22:53:32 <michelled> it seems with keyboard, the first time to put focus on the inline edit, I get the tool tip, but the next time I don't
2014-02-07T22:54:14 <michelled> Bosmon, colinclark: it looks like I can't push this quickly - I will be leaving the office shortly, but I can take a better look at  this tonight or tomorrow
2014-02-07T22:54:22 <michelled> is that too late, colinclark?
2014-02-07T22:54:36 <colinclark> I guess it's up to Bosmon
2014-02-07T22:54:58 <colinclark> but we can't do the impossible, so tonight or tomorrow is fine
2014-02-07T22:55:44 <Bosmon> michelled - yes, I can see this too
2014-02-07T22:55:48 <Bosmon> I'll investigate it this evening
2014-02-07T22:57:29 <michelled> ok, I'll look for you online when I get home tonight
2014-02-07T23:03:51 <colinclark> thanks, fish
2014-02-07T23:03:52 <colinclark> i appreciate it

b'2014-02-07T21:23:05 <Bosmon> colinclark - don\'t you have to fly right about now? : P
2014-02-07T21:23:10 <drewwills1> the fluid.pager component, when viewed (or inspected) in a browser, still has exactly 1 "row" element, which contains the same text/nothing as before the component was instantiated
2014-02-07T21:23:17 <colinclark> Couple more hours. It\'s a late flight
2014-02-07T21:23:21 <Bosmon> oh cool
2014-02-07T21:23:24 <Bosmon> cheers!
2014-02-07T21:23:35 <drewwills1> yes, cheers :)
2014-02-07T21:24:22 <drewwills1> Bosmon not only would you have to deploy it locally, you would have to patch in some tech
2014-02-07T21:24:29 <Bosmon> patch in some tech!
2014-02-07T21:25:06 <drewwills1> details here:  https://github.com/Jasig/resource-server/pull/21
2014-02-07T21:25:55 <drewwills1> but possibly a feature branch can be organized for this purpose
2014-02-07T21:25:59 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-07T21:26:20 <Bosmon> It would be great if perhaps someone could open a port to an instance I could tinker with
2014-02-07T21:26:24 <colinclark> Bosmon: Just spinning through the updated pull request, do I see a few artifacts of a failed merge? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/447/files#diff-f2392b48da9a0316fc7dbc8d33360be9R23
2014-02-07T21:27:06 <Bosmon> Sorry colinclark, let me update
2014-02-07T21:27:13 <colinclark> thanks

2014-02-07T21:28:33 <drewwills1> Bosmon atm we have precisely 2 local (laptop) dev boxes running this tech... I can put our work in a feature branch... i can also do a hangout/screen share if it helps... i would have to drive, but you could tell me what to click & hover
2014-02-07T21:29:11 <Bosmon> drewwills1 - sounds cool - shall we set up a time slot on Monday perhaps?
2014-02-07T21:29:33 <drewwills1> that works... are you in CO?
2014-02-07T21:30:05 <Bosmon> drewwills1 - yes - although I tend to be on rather a late schedule : P
2014-02-07T21:30:08 <Bosmon> colinclark - pushed
2014-02-07T21:30:17 <colinclark> thnk you
2014-02-07T21:31:07 <drewwills1> 3 or 4 pm AZ time?  I\'m guessing you\'re currently 1 hr ahead of me
2014-02-07T21:31:28 <Bosmon> Right here it\'s 2.30pm now, yes
2014-02-07T21:31:39 <drewwills1> oops -- same time then
2014-02-07T21:31:45 <drewwills1> 2:32 here
2014-02-07T21:31:58 <Bosmon> 3pm works for me
2014-02-07T21:32:05 <Bosmon> I\'ll need to leave at 4, but we can have a first bash at it
2014-02-07T21:32:36 <drewwills1> excellent, that\'s terrific... i will probably do the feture branch anyway, since this work probably calls for it

2014-02-07T22:02:31 <colinclark> Bosmon: We\'re still in the position where I should expect test failures in IE11 for a little while longer, right?
2014-02-07T22:02:42 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes
2014-02-07T22:02:47 <Bosmon> Although hopefully fewer than before
2014-02-07T22:02:53 <colinclark> yep
2014-02-07T22:02:54 <Bosmon> The main one I\'m aware of is in keyboard-a11y
2014-02-07T22:02:58 <Bosmon> What are you seeing?
2014-02-07T22:03:06 <colinclark> they\'re now limited to ka11y, Renderer, and Renderer-utilities
2014-02-07T22:03:17 <Bosmon> ah
2014-02-07T22:03:24 <colinclark> The Renderer issues appear to the ref:id-related ones
2014-02-07T22:03:28 <colinclark> rsf:id
2014-02-07T22:03:34 <Bosmon> Those should have been fixed by my previous pull
2014-02-07T22:03:44 <colinclark> were those merged into this branch?
2014-02-07T22:03:49 <Bosmon> No, only into master
2014-02-07T22:03:55 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-07T22:03:55 <colinclark> good
2014-02-07T22:04:02 <colinclark> So I\'ll retest when I merge into master
2014-02-07T22:04:17 <Bosmon> You should find that only keyboard-a11y failures are left
2014-02-07T22:05:16 <Bosmon> michelled - do you feel like being a reviewer on KETTOL? : P
2014-02-07T22:05:43 <colinclark> Ok, merge conflicts
2014-02-07T22:05:52 <colinclark> makeEventFirer\'s signature has changed
2014-02-07T22:06:05 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-02-07T22:06:10 <Bosmon> As of about 5 minutes ago : P
2014-02-07T22:06:12 <colinclark> right
2014-02-07T22:07:20 <michelled> Bosmon: sure
2014-02-07T22:09:04 <colinclark> Now I\'ve got one of the Enactors tests failing
2014-02-07T22:09:06 <colinclark> is that expected?
2014-02-07T22:09:13 <colinclark> and more than that
2014-02-07T22:09:26 <colinclark> I think I may have to pass this to you, michelled
2014-02-07T22:09:36 <colinclark> I have to get on a plane and I still haven\'t packed
2014-02-07T22:09:43 <colinclark> any chance you can take a look and merge?
2014-02-07T22:10:33 <colinclark> This is the branch I have with a few extra linting changes on top of Bosmon\'s pull request: https://github.com/colinbdclark/infusion/commits/FLUID-3674
2014-02-07T22:10:59 <michelled> colinclark: sure
2014-02-07T22:11:03 <colinclark> But when I merge I\'m getting dozens of failures in IE11
2014-02-07T22:11:05 <michelled> you\'ve finished the review?
2014-02-07T22:11:16 <michelled> you are happy as long as it actually works?
2014-02-07T22:11:53 <michelled> IE11 has a ton a failures, but I suppose if Bosmon is expecting this to fix them, we need to look into it
2014-02-07T22:12:34 <Bosmon> I\'m taking a look now
2014-02-07T22:15:07 * anastasiac has quit
2014-02-07T22:15:18 <Bosmon> Runs ok for me in FF at least
2014-02-07T22:15:22 <Bosmon> Trying me IE11 vm now...
2014-02-07T22:17:18 * yzen has quit
2014-02-07T22:23:30 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-07T22:23:46 <Bosmon> michelled, colinclark - I see no new failures in the FLUID-3674 branch that aren\'t already in master
2014-02-07T22:24:14 <Bosmon> I\'ve updated my FLUID-3674 with a further merged version
2014-02-07T22:27:15 <colinclark> Maybe it\'s some stupid IE thing
2014-02-07T22:27:23 <colinclark> I\'m certainly passing in FF and Chrome on Mac OS X
2014-02-07T22:28:45 <Bosmon> colinclark ?
2014-02-07T22:28:59 <Bosmon> All of the remaining failures I see in IE seem due to the focus issues
2014-02-07T22:29:02 <Bosmon> Are you seeing something else
2014-02-07T22:29:55 <colinclark> many components tests are failing
2014-02-07T22:29:57 <Bosmon> btw I think I have made an "executive decision" to adopt APPROACH A that I outlined in my email
2014-02-07T22:29:59 <colinclark> in IE 11
2014-02-07T22:30:07 <Bosmon> colinclark - can you be specific?
2014-02-07T22:30:41 <Bosmon> I don\'t think we have time to rewrite all these tests, so I think I will "improve" the fluid.focus method instead
2014-02-07T22:31:21 <Bosmon> That is, to cause it to synchronously trigger jQuery handlers registered for the focus event, just like the old $.focus() used to
2014-02-07T22:31:25 <Bosmon> Does that sound reasonable to everyone?
2014-02-07T22:32:46 <Bosmon> I do see an Enactor test failing, but that one is also in master
2014-02-07T22:33:00 <colinclark> keyboard a11y
2014-02-07T22:33:01 <Bosmon> And it seems as if it is an IE-specific test that we perhaps expect to fail
2014-02-07T22:33:02 <colinclark> Enactor
2014-02-07T22:33:06 <colinclark> AriaLabeller
2014-02-07T22:33:09 <colinclark> ImageReorderer
2014-02-07T22:33:12 <colinclark> Layout
2014-02-07T22:33:15 <colinclark> Nested
2014-02-07T22:33:20 <colinclark> ReordererList
2014-02-07T22:33:26 <colinclark> FileQueueView
2014-02-07T22:33:29 <colinclark> are those the expected ones?
2014-02-07T22:33:34 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-02-07T22:33:42 <colinclark> phew
2014-02-07T22:33:43 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-07T22:33:44 <Bosmon> All expected, except possibly for AriaLabeller and Enactor
2014-02-07T22:33:49 <Bosmon> And at least all of them are in current master
2014-02-07T22:33:56 <colinclark> michelled: all you need to do, then, is functional test this, then
2014-02-07T22:34:05 <colinclark> I can verify that tests are passing everywhere except IE11
2014-02-07T22:34:15 <colinclark> and Bosmon can apparently verify that the IE11 are expected
2014-02-07T22:34:17 <Bosmon> I\'ll issue a pull over the weekend fixing all of the focus tests in IE10+
2014-02-07T22:34:20 <colinclark> thank you
2014-02-07T22:34:28 <Bosmon> We\'ll need to chuck the Enactor one back to the UIO team
2014-02-07T22:34:31 <colinclark> I approve of your ex dec, by the way
2014-02-07T22:34:38 <colinclark> "Preferences Framework"
2014-02-07T22:34:39 <Bosmon> And the AriaLabeller one may be a real bug
2014-02-07T22:34:58 <Bosmon> But I believe again just a bug in the test cases
2014-02-07T22:35:27 <Bosmon> Actually I think AriaLabeller is just another manifestation of the focus issue
2014-02-07T22:35:35 <Bosmon> "I\'ve seen this many times before"
2014-02-07T22:35:58 <Bosmon> If the Reorderer never believes that an element is focused, it refuses to receive keyboard events for it
2014-02-07T22:36:51 <Bosmon> I\'ll write a note on fluid.focus referring back to the correspondence about it
2014-02-07T22:37:11 <Bosmon> But I believe if this strategy never caused us problems when it was in jQuery in the last 5 years, it\'s unlikely to start causing us problems now
2014-02-07T22:37:34 <Bosmon> But it seems clear that adapting to the new behaviour would require us to rewrite about half a dozen test files wholesale
2014-02-07T22:39:42 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-07T22:40:06 <colinclark> Is michelled still around? I just want to make sure she\'s able to do the push, otherwise I\'ll see if I can finish it up shortly
2014-02-07T22:40:08 <colinclark> now that I\'m packed
2014-02-07T22:40:14 <michelled> yes, I can do it
2014-02-07T22:40:20 <colinclark> ok, that\'s awesome
2014-02-07T22:40:22 <michelled> sorry, was talking to avtar
2014-02-07T22:40:23 <colinclark> I hugely appreciate it
2014-02-07T22:40:24 <colinclark> no problem
2014-02-07T22:40:30 <colinclark> so again, I\'ve verified all the unit tests
2014-02-07T22:40:33 <colinclark> it\'s been code reviewed
2014-02-07T22:40:45 <colinclark> it just needs enough functional testing that we can verify that it doesn\'t regress anything
2014-02-07T22:40:55 <michelled> sounds good
2014-02-07T22:41:05 <michelled> and I should use Bosmon\'s branch?
2014-02-07T22:41:15 <colinclark> Use mine
2014-02-07T22:41:18 <colinclark> I linted
2014-02-07T22:41:28 <colinclark> Using JSHint
2014-02-07T22:41:40 <colinclark> it was enough to catch the missing semicolons and one redefined variable
2014-02-07T22:42:19 <michelled> I think his branch includes your linting
2014-02-07T22:42:32 <colinclark> ah, you merged my branch, Bosmon?
2014-02-07T22:42:40 <colinclark> I must have missed that, sorry
2014-02-07T22:42:54 <Bosmon> Yes, I merged your branch in
2014-02-07T22:43:57 <colinclark> I love it when projects keep their documentation right in the repository
2014-02-07T22:44:01 <colinclark> this is something to keep in mind for us
2014-02-07T22:44:27 <colinclark> I\'ve started publishing all the Flocking documentation for now just as Markdown files that get rendered by Github when you\'re looking at the source tree
2014-02-07T22:44:33 <colinclark> it\'s very helpful when you\'re getting on a plane
2014-02-07T22:48:29 <michelled> Bosmon: I\'m not seeing the tooltip in the inline edit demo
2014-02-07T22:48:50 <michelled> oh, wait, I am now
2014-02-07T22:48:55 <michelled> maybe I didn\'t wait long enough?
2014-02-07T22:49:44 <michelled> it doesn\'t seem to be working with the same consistency as it once was
2014-02-07T22:49:54 <michelled> Bosmon: do you also see that behaviour?

2014-02-07T14:45:18 <Justin_o_> michelled: turns out that issue with not being able to save to the remote preferences server is a known issue.. kasparnet was hoping i could work with avtar to look into it. http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-569
2014-02-07T14:46:06 <Justin_o_> michelled: so in terms of PMT integration we have two issues.. 1) where we can\'t post at all even locally if the io.json is added.. 2) can\'t post remotely ever
2014-02-07T14:47:53 <michelled> I see. btw, I checked with avtar yesterday and the online prefs server is from the reveiw2 branch
2014-02-07T14:53:52 <Justin_o_> michelled: thanks for checking.. i wonder why things stopped working.. do you know if any changes were made to the server it is running on?
2014-02-07T15:01:13 <jessm> Justin_o_: sounds good!

2014-02-07T15:44:39 <drewwills> good morning fluid folks... I did some testing with an infusion build after pull #448 in uPortal and found at least one issue... which could easily be related to how we\'re using it, but any hints or insights are much appreciated
2014-02-07T15:45:11 <drewwills> I wrote up my findings on the pull request page:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/448

2014-02-07T15:51:07 <drewwills> I was just forwarded an email from antranig (via James) that discusses instantiating the \'fluid.pagedTable\' component instead of the \'fluid.pager\' component... perhaps this suggestion is related to what I\'m seeing
2014-02-07T15:55:41 <colinclark> Thanks, drewwills. Bosmon is closely watching your progress and is signed up to fix any further bugs you encounter over the next few days.
2014-02-07T15:56:27 <drewwills> thank you (and him) -- reading his email, looks as though it may be an api change
2014-02-07T16:02:45 <Justin_o_> fluid-everyone: as part of my work for switching our builds to grunt. i\'ve changed the name of our products. infusionAll.js -> infusion.js and myInfusion.js to custom-infusion.js. The zip files themselves have also had similar name changes. What do you all think of that?
2014-02-07T16:03:02 <Justin_o_> the work hasn\'t been merged into master yet, so there is still time to change things.
2014-02-07T16:03:35 <colinclark> I guess the renaming of "Infusion all" is a bit confusing to me
2014-02-07T16:03:59 <Justin_o_> colinclark: why is that?
2014-02-07T16:04:04 <colinclark> well
2014-02-07T16:04:15 <colinclark> I guess it\'s nice to know unambiguously what something is
2014-02-07T16:05:29 <Justin_o_> colinclark: the names of the custom file and whole infusion itself are different for that reason..
2014-02-07T16:05:43 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i was finding it strange that we don\'t output something actually called infusion..
2014-02-07T16:06:39 <colinclark> I guess I\'m open to other people\'s thoughts, but I think I\'d prefer infusion-all.js and infusion-custom.js
2014-02-07T16:07:15 <Justin_o_> colinclark: so one thing to note about the custom version, is that you can change the name "custom" to any valid name you want

2014-02-07T17:06:59 <anastasiac> Justin_o_, regarding naming the output, I think I prefer "infusion-custom" to "custom-infusion" (puts \'infusion\' front and centre; lower cognitive load). As for "infusion.js" vs. "infusion-all.js", I don\'t really think I have a preference. I can see arguments for both. I don\'t think "all" is required; I suspect most people might assume that "infusion.js" contains all of infusion, just as "jquery-ui.js" includes all of jQuery UI. But addi
2014-02-07T17:07:00 <anastasiac> the "all" certainly does increase clarity.

2014-02-07T17:12:58 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: thanks for the input.. i agree too that infusion-custom is better..
2014-02-07T17:13:25 <Justin_o_> as for the source.. i just find infusion.js to be cleaner name and I\'d expect to get everything with it..
2014-02-07T17:13:37 <Justin_o_> i\'m fine with whatever is generally preferred though
2014-02-07T17:14:00 <Justin_o_> colinclark, anastasiac: any last votes either way?
2014-02-07T17:33:29 <michelled> jessm, anastasiac: would you like to Skype at 1:00?
2014-02-07T17:33:49 <Justin_o_> fluid-everyone: sounds like the general preference is infusion-all.js and infusion-custom.js
2014-02-07T17:33:56 <Justin_o_> that\'s what i\'ll put into the pull request. thanks
2014-02-07T17:34:01 <michelled> thx Justin_o_

2014-02-07T20:55:59 <Bosmon> hi cindyli!
2014-02-07T20:57:18 <cindyli> Bosmon: about the new model relay again. Is the "modelRelay" section required to be defined on the source component, not the target component?
2014-02-07T20:57:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - it may be defined at either end
2014-02-07T20:58:20 <cindyli> Bosmon: i tried with the target end but the target model is not transformed, still stays null
2014-02-07T20:58:36 <cindyli> i have a unit test. one sec
2014-02-07T20:59:04 <cindyli> http://pastie.org/8709862
2014-02-07T20:59:18 <cindyli> let me know if anywhere looks suspicious, Bosmon?
2014-02-07T20:59:32 <cindyli> also tried with the source end. works fine
2014-02-07T21:00:34 <cindyli> the unit test that has modelRelay defined at the source end - http://pastie.org/8709867
2014-02-07T21:01:14 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-07T21:01:21 <Bosmon> You can remove the "eventedComponent" grades
2014-02-07T21:01:30 <cindyli> ah ok
2014-02-07T21:01:36 <Bosmon> The whole idea of being "standard" is that you are evented : P
2014-02-07T21:01:45 <Bosmon> But yes, it seems like it may be a bug
2014-02-07T21:03:05 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Bosmon
2014-02-07T21:07:23 <drewwills1> Bosman -- does this page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Pager+API reflect the current state of the fluid.pager/fluid.pagedTable components in master?  Is there a page like that which does, if not?
2014-02-07T21:07:42 <drewwills1> and thanks for that really comprehansive and excellent email you sent James
2014-02-07T21:08:05 * jessm joined the channel
2014-02-07T21:08:50 <drewwills1> sorry that was @ Bosmon
2014-02-07T21:09:32 <Bosmon> Hi drewwills1 - I\'m sorry to say it does not
2014-02-07T21:09:50 <Bosmon> I\'ve been trying to steadily plough through our docs in the last few weeks but this one is lagging
2014-02-07T21:10:06 <Bosmon> Also since I hadn\'t realised that the pager still had any users : P
2014-02-07T21:10:19 <drewwills1> ah, well it\'s best to have a clear answer on that, at any rate... I\'m trying to digest this:  "in the immediate term you\'ll need some  other changes to successfully upgrade this code - at the least, you will need to change the type name on  line 259 from "fluid.pager" to "fluid.pagedTable" since this component has been refactored into separate  pager and table components for a better separation of responsibilities"
2014-02-07T21:10:27 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-02-07T21:10:48 <Bosmon> Mostly you should be able to just replace any instances of the name "fluid.pager" with "fluid.pagedTable" and have almost everything work
2014-02-07T21:11:33 <drewwills1> I attempted to sub fluid.pagedTable for fluid.pager, but it didn\'t immediately work... i\'m looking for a good way to review the options we\'re passing vs. the parameters it supports
2014-02-07T21:11:42 <Bosmon> We managed to have full compatibility on our other components but I took the opportunity to refactor the pager a little since I had thought it was just a private matter : P
2014-02-07T21:11:52 <Bosmon> But I\'ll make sure we get your stuff working again quickly
2014-02-07T21:12:17 <drewwills1> uPortal has I think 5-7 pager-based admin interfaces, I believe
2014-02-07T21:12:28 <Bosmon> wow, ok
2014-02-07T21:12:41 <drewwills1> portlet manager/gallery/user manager to start with
2014-02-07T21:13:23 <Bosmon> Well, all of the old functionality is definitely still supported, it\'s just that a few things have been renamed
2014-02-07T21:13:40 <Bosmon> So I\'m confident we\'ll get you going again
2014-02-07T21:14:25 <drewwills1> we have folks here (including me) who implemented some of these back in the day... so we\'re not entirely helpless ;-)
2014-02-07T21:14:30 <Bosmon> One thing is that we\'re still waiting on a merge from colinclark that might cause a few more changes
2014-02-07T21:14:43 <Bosmon> So I\'d like to get that in before we carry on diagnosing your problems
2014-02-07T21:14:51 <Bosmon> They\'re relevant to the computePageLimit issue that you found
2014-02-07T21:14:58 <drewwills1> ah okay
2014-02-07T21:15:18 <Bosmon> In an optimistic mood, I might hope that the merge might simply make the issues go away :)
2014-02-07T21:15:21 <Bosmon> But we\'ll see
2014-02-07T21:16:35 <drewwills1> we are attempting to be in a position to cut an RC1 for uPortal 4.1 in maybe a week or two... do you think colin\'s efforts align with that time table?
2014-02-07T21:17:32 <Bosmon> It should happen "at any moment" : P
2014-02-07T21:17:39 <Bosmon> Yes, we\'ll certainly have you running by then
2014-02-07T21:17:54 <drewwills1> we would continue to use the working version we have until the official release, except that uP 4.1 requires Bootstrap3 -> requires jQ 1.9+
2014-02-07T21:18:23 <drewwills1> awesome
2014-02-07T21:20:56 <Bosmon> drewwills1 - just to get my thinking into gear - at exactly what point during the lifecycle do you see your "computePageCount" issues?
2014-02-07T21:21:06 <Bosmon> Is it during startup of the component, or during servicing of some other event?
2014-02-07T21:21:48 <drewwills1> the startup, it must be... the data in the dataModel never makes it into the DOM
2014-02-07T21:22:01 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-07T21:22:24 <Bosmon> And is there a way I can get to see the system running - do you have a public(ish) instance or would I have to install it myself?
2014-02-07T21:22:37 <colinclark> I finished code review of the pull request last night
2014-02-07T21:22:53 <colinclark> and I\'m just on to merging and testing now
2014-02-07T21:22:54 <colinclark> So it should deb in within the next hour
