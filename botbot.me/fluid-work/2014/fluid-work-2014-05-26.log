b'2014-05-26T15:19:33 <AndyStiegler> but thats true for loging in sammy too, isn\'t it?
2014-05-26T15:21:07 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler - I haven\'t tested with Sammy
2014-05-26T15:21:33 <kasparnet> but in case you\'re testing with the pilot2 branch code, you need to include the xxxxEnabled settings as well
2014-05-26T15:21:37 <AndyStiegler> https://www.dropbox.com/s/477n8ne7kv3hqcr/Untitled-2.png   thats the mm result of sammy loging in. no applicationSettings, but the magnifier is correctly started and modified (just tested it, it reverts from 450 magnification back to 200 when loging in sammy, as it should)
2014-05-26T15:21:44 <kasparnet> else all the settings of magnifier and screenreaders will be ignored
2014-05-26T15:21:53 <AndyStiegler> was the master
2014-05-26T15:22:16 * michelled has quit
2014-05-26T15:22:19 <AndyStiegler> so how are sammys settings transported?
2014-05-26T15:23:02 <kasparnet> that\'s a really good question
2014-05-26T15:23:41 <kasparnet> doesn\'t the matchmaker take  care of it though?
2014-05-26T15:23:43 * michelled joined the channel
2014-05-26T15:23:44 <kasparnet> the flat one
2014-05-26T15:24:04 <kasparnet> ... or well, I guess there might not be any settings - even common term ones
2014-05-26T15:24:21 <AndyStiegler> the screenshot shows the result of the flat matchmaker after transformation
2014-05-26T15:25:07 <AndyStiegler> did anybody actually test if the smm as its deloyed atm actually works :D i mean we do all the debuging just cause the applicationSettings blob is missing
2014-05-26T15:25:29 <colinclark> So I will say upfront that I\xe2\x80\x99m not convinced this use of the Flat Matchmaker is either appropriate nor recommended
2014-05-26T15:25:48 <kasparnet> yeah - I at least attempted to do the pilot setup, point to a local STMM server, and it didn\'t set any settings as far as I can tell
2014-05-26T15:25:54 <AndyStiegler> when i\'m currently not even sure if its supposed to be there.. but then again.. how do the settings go.. hmhm
2014-05-26T15:26:08 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to make it work, but we have not, to date, intended the Flat Matchmaker to serve as infrastructure for other matchmakers in this manner
2014-05-26T15:26:44 <AndyStiegler> hm, but thats the way both the smm and the rbmm are using the flat mm atm. and its just replacing the transformers with statistical inference.. its a 1:1 code copy
2014-05-26T15:27:17 <AndyStiegler> for reference, the stock one
2014-05-26T15:27:18 <AndyStiegler> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/src/MatchMaker.js#L169
2014-05-26T15:27:58 <AndyStiegler> only difference in that function is the transformers.. and if you have a profile consisting of just app specific settings and you comment-out the transformer, the result shoul be just the same, right?
2014-05-26T15:28:19 <AndyStiegler> (which is the target scenario of the smm)
2014-05-26T15:29:15 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: theoretically yes (I think so at least).. The problem is that neither Colin nor I have worked on the MM code for a long time (me pretty much ever, colin ~2 years ago), so it\'s slightly blackboxy what is happening/supposed to happen for us as well
2014-05-26T15:30:02 <AndyStiegler> yea but i guess you know what the result of the matchmaker is supposed to look like, right?
2014-05-26T15:30:20 <colinclark> for sure
2014-05-26T15:30:42 <AndyStiegler> ok, so the applicationSettings blob has to be there, right?
2014-05-26T15:30:47 <AndyStiegler> fr each settingshandler
2014-05-26T15:31:01 <AndyStiegler> like seen here for example http://pastebin.com/bmzjzbeV
2014-05-26T15:31:14 <kasparnet> hehe I dont :)
2014-05-26T15:31:48 <kasparnet> alright - gotta go now need to be somewhere at 18 and have to go kill me a bird before then :)
2014-05-26T15:32:01 <kasparnet> I\'ll be back later tonight to take a look at it
2014-05-26T15:32:11 <AndyStiegler> ok, have a nice evening kaspar :)
2014-05-26T15:32:48 * jhernandez has quit
2014-05-26T15:33:26 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: I guess the successcriteria would be something along the lines of: if you deploy the pilot2 setup on your local machine, change this line https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/pilots2/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/configs/pilot2.json#L20 to point at your locally running ST MM and log in with a ST MM np set, then everything is fine and dandy :)
2014-05-26T15:33:51 <AndyStiegler> just doing that :D
2014-05-26T15:33:53 <kasparnet> good luck with it, and tty both later
2014-05-26T15:33:59 <AndyStiegler> cu :)
2014-05-26T15:37:41 <AndyStiegler> is there a shipped profile to be used for smm/rbmm testing?

2014-05-26T15:55:29 <michelled> @simonjb: if you get a chance, can you update this JIRA relating to the generation of docs from code comments? http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5326
2014-05-26T15:55:39 <michelled> perhaps it\'s ready to be closed?
2014-05-26T15:57:39 <simonjb> michelled: I\'ll add the comments that I got from steve and let\'s close after Justin_o gets a chance to try it out
2014-05-26T15:57:54 <michelled> great! thanks
2014-05-26T16:02:58 <simonjb> michelled, Justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5326 updated with the tool location

2014-05-26T17:46:11 <Justin_o> simonjb, michelled: i did a test run of the fluid-tags tool. It basically outputs the file into HTML and breaks up the page appropriately so that you can easily jump around to the various functions. There\'s syntax highlighting for the JS portions too, which is nice.. although the html file could use more styling. It seems to be pretty good though.
2014-05-26T17:47:03 <Justin_o> simonjb, michelled: unfortunately it doesn\'t add a title to the html file, and there is no doctype
2014-05-26T17:48:24 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks for checking it out
2014-05-26T17:49:05 <Justin_o> simonjb, michelled: should i start working on creating html pages with it?
2014-05-26T17:49:14 <Justin_o> also if that\'s the case what should the file names be?
2014-05-26T17:49:40 <michelled> Justin_o, simonjb: did we have a plan for the workflow of this? would we use a github post commit hook?
2014-05-26T17:49:56 <simonjb> Justin_o: I\'m thinking that if we go ahead with the docpad generation of html, it would be nice to have steve tool output HTML fragments, rather than complete pages -- that way we can template and style in a way that matches the other doc pages
2014-05-26T17:51:12 <simonjb> michelled: no workflow yet, I\'m thinking that it would be nice to work into the docpad run if possible
2014-05-26T17:51:28 <Justin_o> simonjb: makes sense.. i wonder if it should output markdown instead then
2014-05-26T17:51:47 <simonjb> Justin_o: markdown would also work
2014-05-26T17:52:45 <Justin_o> i guess it might be easier to start with html fragments, so we can just drop the head
2014-05-26T17:52:57 <Justin_o> simonjb: will you be able to talk to steve about this?
2014-05-26T17:53:01 <simonjb> steve is open to making changes to the tool to change the output
2014-05-26T17:53:28 <Justin_o> simonjb: he\'s also using code mirror for the code blocks.. so you might need to do some coordination on this too
2014-05-26T17:54:04 <simonjb> Justin_o: what\'s code mirror?
2014-05-26T17:55:04 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2014-05-26T17:55:44 <Justin_o> simonjb: i believe it\'s this http://codemirror.net
2014-05-26T17:56:16 <Justin_o> simonjb: but in this case the code snippets aren\'t editable
2014-05-26T17:56:19 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon, Justin_o and I are reviewing ur pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/520/. there are a few places that we don\'t quite understand and hope you can walk us thru
2014-05-26T17:56:28 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli, sure
2014-05-26T17:56:29 <simonjb> Justin_o, michelled: as a first work flow plan, I am thinking: 1) run steve
2014-05-26T17:56:39 <colinclark> RUN STEVE
2014-05-26T17:56:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: Skype?
2014-05-26T17:57:13 <simonjb> \'s tool manually and commit to infusion-docs
2014-05-26T17:57:27 <cindyli> fine with me, Justin_o
2014-05-26T17:57:29 <simonjb> colinclark :-P
2014-05-26T17:57:34 <colinclark> :)
2014-05-26T17:58:16 <simonjb> michelled, Justin_o: just about to commit the rest of the pages to my docpad repo, but here\'s what it looks like https://github.com/simonbates/infusion-docs-docpad
2014-05-26T17:58:49 <simonjb> we could add the generated API docs to src/documents/api or such
2014-05-26T17:59:35 <simonjb> ultimately, we can I think make the running of the tool part of the build, but a first step would be to manually run and commit the generated HTML
2014-05-26T18:01:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli, michelled: maybe we should just talk here instead of skype
2014-05-26T18:01:48 <michelled> that makes sense. I\'d like to see us do this as a build step with a git hook so that the docs stay in sync with the code in the repo
2014-05-26T18:01:54 <Bosmon> Sorry, yes, I\'m not too sure where my headphones are now
2014-05-26T18:02:01 <Bosmon> Everything in the apartment is in a bit of a mess
2014-05-26T18:02:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem
2014-05-26T18:03:49 <Justin_o> simonjb, michelled: I was thinking it might be nice to separate docpad from the docs.. so we\'d have the docs as they are now, but our instance with docpad would pull them down somehow..
2014-05-26T18:04:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is our first question https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/520/files#r13052847
2014-05-26T18:04:30 <Justin_o> we left a comment for that actually
2014-05-26T18:04:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I saw that
2014-05-26T18:04:45 <Bosmon> There\'s not much we can do about this at present
2014-05-26T18:05:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i guess if we can\'t fix it, would you be able to update the comment with some more details about what the issue is?
2014-05-26T18:05:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can\'t
2014-05-26T18:05:51 <Bosmon> That is why the comment is there : P
2014-05-26T18:06:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: because we don\'t know why this has to be at all?
2014-05-26T18:06:06 <simonjb> rest of the pages added to https://github.com/simonbates/infusion-docs-docpad
2014-05-26T18:06:35 * yzen joined the channel
2014-05-26T18:06:56 <simonjb> Justin_o: separate docpad from the generated API docs, or from the docs that we are writing?
2014-05-26T18:07:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sadly the thinking behind this part of the algorithm has already become unclear
2014-05-26T18:07:59 <Bosmon> What is clear is that it needs to be reworked completely
2014-05-26T18:08:07 <Bosmon> But we don\'t have time for this before the release
2014-05-26T18:09:00 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess both.. but perhaps i misread what you committed.. were those just the generated docs?
2014-05-26T18:09:23 <simonjb> Justin_o: no, the source
2014-05-26T18:10:21 <Justin_o> simonjb: it\'s a bit of a shame that we have to use extensions like .html.md for docpad
2014-05-26T18:10:47 <Justin_o> i was thinking it would be nice to keep them completely separated so that transition to other gerators and other uses might be easier.
2014-05-26T18:11:04 <simonjb> Justin_o: I believe it\'s an effect of the plugin system -- the extensions trigger what conversion to run
2014-05-26T18:12:50 <Justin_o> simonjb: yes.. i think that\'s correct.. i had read about that before.. and if i\'m not mistaken it is so it knows the input and output formats. but it\'s unfortunate in that we\'ll have to require people to think about those extensions when they are creating new docs
2014-05-26T18:14:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think that was i main question.. and I think the rest were related.. so i guess that\'s about it.. can you add that comment you gave us here to the pull request so we can keep track of it
2014-05-26T18:14:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2014-05-26T18:15:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-05-26T18:16:16 <Justin_o> simonjb: where would images go? In files?
2014-05-26T18:16:54 <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, files is for static content which isn\'t processed
2014-05-26T18:18:21 <Justin_o> simonjb: it\'s sounding like we\'ll have to adopt docpads structure.. or else have a  build script that generates it for use with docpad.. maybe this would work
2014-05-26T18:20:39 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-05-26T18:24:54 <simonjb> Justin_o: I\'m still learning docpad but I see that it does distinguish between files which are processed (src/documents) and files which are not (src/files) -- at this point, I don\'t know what it is possible to overide and what it is not
2014-05-26T18:25:34 <simonjb> Justin_o: your concern with adpoting docpad directory conventions is that it makes it harder to switch to another tool?
2014-05-26T18:26:33 <Justin_o> simonjb: i think mostly yes.. i guess i\'d also like to have a clean repo so that people who\'d want to work on the documentation wouldn\'t have to know about docpad requirements
2014-05-26T18:27:19 * avtar has quit
2014-05-26T18:28:01 <simonjb> Justin_o: no matter what tool we use, there will be no escaping it affecting the way the documentation is written (hopefully not too drastically, but I think it is unavoidable)
2014-05-26T18:29:19 <Justin_o> simonjb: :(
2014-05-26T18:30:03 <Justin_o> michelled: cindyli and I are finished looking at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/520
2014-05-26T18:30:19 <Justin_o> michelled: we haven\'t merged it yet though
2014-05-26T18:31:02 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you update the pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/520 up to date with the master when you have a chance?
2014-05-26T18:42:59 <simonjb> Justin_o: looks like the directory structure is fairly flexible in docpad (http://docpad.org/docs/config) and I\'m currently looking to see if there is any way to use foo.md rather than foo.html.md

2014-05-26T18:59:55 <simonjb> Justin_o: it\'s possible to name the markdown docs foo.md (there\'s a config option "renderSingleExtensions" which turns on processing of files without an \'output\' extension -- it\'s then up to the \'input\' plugin to decide what to do, which for the marked plugin is to generate html)

2014-05-26T19:02:03 <simonjb> Justin_o: will write up an email to the fluid list now with a pointer to the docpad conversion and we can start a conversion there
2014-05-26T19:03:18 <simonjb> last "conversion" should have been "we can start a conversation there"

2014-05-26T12:29:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: hello, told you I can go all the way once we\'ve resolved that thing last week with applying the mergePolicy - I still think so, however, this ain\'t resolved completely yet :)
2014-05-26T12:29:55 <amilchev> Justin_o: last time declaring this path was how the mergePolicy was properly set: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/U8FYmGBz
2014-05-26T12:31:08 <amilchev> Justin_o: now I just want the same thing, however, "always" replaced by "gpii.primarySchema.speakText" and somehow I need to differ the dots in "gpii.primarySchema.speakText" from doths used for the path..
2014-05-26T12:31:51 <Justin_o> amilchev: right.. i think you can escape them
2014-05-26T12:31:57 <Justin_o> try using "\\" in front
2014-05-26T12:32:09 <amilchev> one sec
2014-05-26T12:33:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: or you might need a "\\\\".. let me know if either of those work
2014-05-26T12:38:57 <amilchev> Justin_o: tried with "auxiliarySchema.groups.visualAlternatives.panels.gpii\\.primarySchema\\.speakText": fluid.prefs.compositePanel.arrayMergePolicy,
2014-05-26T12:39:26 <amilchev> and with "\\\\" as well - no result with either

2014-05-26T12:44:54 <Justin_o> or IoCSS syntax either
2014-05-26T12:45:25 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. i guess you could use the distribute options for this
2014-05-26T12:46:16 <Justin_o> then you could use IoCSS syntax to apply pass down the configuration to any grade of a certain type
2014-05-26T12:46:52 <Justin_o> but maybe that\'s not what you want to do actually
2014-05-26T12:47:16 <Justin_o> since i guess it\'s not that you want all the grades to have this, but rather all paths into some configuration
2014-05-26T12:47:22 <Justin_o> is that correct?
2014-05-26T12:47:25 <Justin_o> amilchev: ^

2014-05-26T13:27:36 <Justin_o> amilchev: i was looking at your case with cindyli. It doesn\'t seem to be supported.. cindyli is filing a jira for the fact that escaping doesn\'t work in the mergePolicy
2014-05-26T13:28:00 <Justin_o> amilchev:  the only work around i can think of at the moment is to not use "." in the keys. I\'m not sure if this is an option for you though?

2014-05-26T14:04:30 <kasparnet> Optec, colinclark, Bosmon2: moving a conversation from skype to here in case you have some good ideas as to what\'s wrong.. Just a summary of where we\'re at: We\'re now getting consistent results across the stmm.gpii.net, my install and Andys installation. So the \'only\' remaining issue seems to be missing \'applicationSettings\' block in the return payload from the STMM. I\'m not getting this issue in the pilot2 branch when
2014-05-26T14:04:30 <kasparnet> using the flat MM, but it seems that it could be a problem in the MM framework code (havent tried yet) -- Andys commented in skype: "even when just calling the flat matchmaker with a pref set that only includes app specific settings, there are still no settings produced." so that might be where we should start digging
2014-05-26T14:04:40 <Optec> heyho
2014-05-26T14:04:57 * Optec is now known as AndyStiegler
2014-05-26T14:05:07 <kasparnet> for testing, this payload should be sent to the MM: http://pastebin.com/0MTwrtSz
2014-05-26T14:05:51 <AndyStiegler> here is a reduced one i\'m using currently https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9zb487x8sy0c7s/t4.json
2014-05-26T14:06:04 <kasparnet> using curl, and taking it that the above pastie is in a file called mmpayload.json, this command can be used for testing: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @mmpayload.json http://<MM URL AND PORT>/match
2014-05-26T14:06:39 <AndyStiegler> thats the smm code: https://github.com/AndreasStiegler/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker2/blob/master/lib/StatisticalMatchMaker.js#L33
2014-05-26T14:06:43 <kasparnet> I guess there might be some changeds to the MM code, but I\'m not sure what could have changed
2014-05-26T14:07:13 <AndyStiegler> it alters some preferences and then forwards them to the flat mm. even when commenting-out the inference, there are still no settings being produced
2014-05-26T14:07:22 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: do you remember the date it last worked?
2014-05-26T14:07:30 <AndyStiegler> march 12
2014-05-26T14:08:09 <AndyStiegler> thats when i did the testsession and closed the integration jira. now the flat mm wasn\'t changed till then, besides that dirty hack we added for "enabled" stuff.
2014-05-26T14:08:18 <avtar> kasparnet: while we\'re on the topic of deployments, could you confirm that the master from the universal repo should be used for
2014-05-26T14:08:22 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules
2014-05-26T14:09:42 <AndyStiegler> was that a question for me?
2014-05-26T14:09:50 <avtar> no, for kasparnet
2014-05-26T14:10:21 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: but that was all in the pilot2 branch though (the dirty hacks, that is)
2014-05-26T14:10:45 <kasparnet> avtar: for the stmm.gpii.net deployment, yes!
2014-05-26T14:11:14 <kasparnet> and I believe for flowmanager.gpii.net as well
2014-05-26T14:11:20 <avtar> ok
2014-05-26T14:12:10 <kasparnet> colinclark, Bosmon2, AndyStiegler: from a search of "applicationSettings" in the universal repo, it looks like we dont exactly have an impressive test coverage - only place I find it mentioned is in gpii/node_modules/universal/gpii/node_modules/transformer/test/js/TransformerTests.js
2014-05-26T14:12:41 <AndyStiegler> oh right, my local install still uses the polit universal. let me fix that
2014-05-26T14:12:56 <kasparnet> and seeing how the system doesn\'t crashes if the "ApplicationSettings" block isn\'t set - it just luanches the reelevant applications
2014-05-26T14:13:21 <kasparnet> without setting the settings - something could\'ve slipped through the (test) cracks
2014-05-26T14:14:28 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: according to this, nothing in the MM nor transformer repo has been modified in the last 5 months
2014-05-26T14:14:44 <AndyStiegler> yea that really makes me curious
2014-05-26T14:15:45 <AndyStiegler> so, does anybody have a dump of how the obj how "preferences" should look when it arrives at the flat matchmaker? https://github.com/AndreasStiegler/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker2/blob/master/lib/StatisticalMatchMaker.js#L33
2014-05-26T14:16:09 <AndyStiegler> (with app-specific settings)
2014-05-26T14:17:21 <AndyStiegler> ok noob question: how do you save an object to a file in the node inspector?
2014-05-26T14:17:52 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: hehe, yeah - there might be a smarter way
2014-05-26T14:17:59 <kasparnet> but I\'m generally doing something like
2014-05-26T14:18:14 <kasparnet> console.log(JSON.stringify(OBJECT, null, 3))
2014-05-26T14:18:21 <kasparnet> (where OBJECT is your object)
2014-05-26T14:18:44 <kasparnet> that\'ll print it to the console - and from there you can cpy paste it
2014-05-26T14:18:46 <AndyStiegler> k then its not the noobyness :D
2014-05-26T14:19:06 <kasparnet> hehe nope
2014-05-26T14:19:31 <AndyStiegler> behold, the even more stupid way: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfubyot4umq5n8p/Untitled-1.png
2014-05-26T14:19:37 <AndyStiegler> does that look correct?
2014-05-26T14:20:13 <AndyStiegler> what you see in the variable inspection window on the right is the preferences object. is that what the flat mm expects?
2014-05-26T14:21:26 <kasparnet> I really dont remember - I can try and check how things look when getting that stuff using the pilot 2 branch
2014-05-26T14:21:35 <kasparnet> (and the flat MM)
2014-05-26T14:22:39 <Justin_o> michelled: any idea of any has looked at this pull yet? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/520
2014-05-26T14:23:25 <michelled> Justin_o: I think colinclark is planning to look at it
2014-05-26T14:25:40 <AndyStiegler> ok will set up a fresh new windows gpii install and check. should call the flat mm out of the box, right?
2014-05-26T14:26:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: do you know when you\'ll have a chance to look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/520?
2014-05-26T14:26:45 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: I just tried with my install of GPII, running the pilot2 config
2014-05-26T14:27:07 <AndyStiegler> do you have a dump of a preferences object that works?
2014-05-26T14:27:17 <kasparnet> http://pastebin.com/uDZBjtTC
2014-05-26T14:27:23 <colinclark> Justin_o: nope
2014-05-26T14:27:35 * colinclark has quit
2014-05-26T14:27:55 <AndyStiegler> thx kasparnet
2014-05-26T14:28:21 <kasparnet> this is from a breakpoint put here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/pilots2/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/src/FlatMatchMaker.js#L20
2014-05-26T14:28:21 <AndyStiegler> now thats the leaves
2014-05-26T14:28:26 <kasparnet> printing out the leaves object
2014-05-26T14:28:49 <kasparnet> and what were we looking for?
2014-05-26T14:29:07 <AndyStiegler> can you actually dump me the preferences here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/src/MatchMaker.js#L169
2014-05-26T14:29:38 <AndyStiegler> as its past the transformers it should always be appspecific by then
2014-05-26T14:29:42 <AndyStiegler> thanks so much! :)
2014-05-26T14:31:35 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: http://pastebin.com/HpC5W9MT
2014-05-26T14:32:43 <kasparnet> (this is pilot2 branch calling the flat MM directly with the payload from my previous mmpayload.json pastie)
2014-05-26T14:32:55 <kasparnet> the \'preferences\' object
2014-05-26T14:35:40 <AndyStiegler> hu.. that looks just like what the smm generates
2014-05-26T14:36:30 <AndyStiegler> applications/[appuid]/parameters/key:value
2014-05-26T14:41:19 <AndyStiegler> can you do me a favor and dump https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/src/MatchMaker.js#L176   togo here?
2014-05-26T14:44:38 <kasparnet> AndyStiegler: formatting is a bit fucked up, but: http://pastebin.com/bmzjzbeV
2014-05-26T14:46:19 <AndyStiegler> hm, were would the actual settings be in that blob?
2014-05-26T14:46:49 <AndyStiegler> ok forget it :D
2014-05-26T14:55:33 <AndyStiegler> hu.. when just loging in sammy in a fresh windows gpii install, "togo" also does not contain any application settings object
2014-05-26T14:55:41 <AndyStiegler> yet the magnifiaction is correctly applied
2014-05-26T14:58:49 <AndyStiegler> should there always be such a settings object? what i did back in march was not looking at the actual result, but at the payload the flat-mm desired and making sure i\'m creating a preference blob thats correct for it. then i tested if the result is actually correctly applied. but i never took a look at what the result looks like
2014-05-26T14:59:15 <AndyStiegler> https://www.dropbox.com/s/477n8ne7kv3hqcr/Untitled-2.png   thats sammy loging in with 200% magnification. its correctly applied, but no app settings are there
2014-05-26T14:59:32 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-05-26T15:01:25 <AndyStiegler> correction https://www.dropbox.com/s/477n8ne7kv3hqcr/Untitled-2.png
2014-05-26T15:01:42 <AndyStiegler> @kasparnet: are you actuall sure such an app settings blob is required?
2014-05-26T15:01:58 <colinclark> AndyStiegler and kasparnet: I\xe2\x80\x99m here now and ready to rock
2014-05-26T15:02:07 <colinclark> can you summarize your latest findings and point me to where I can best help?
2014-05-26T15:02:09 <AndyStiegler> heyho colinclark :)
2014-05-26T15:02:30 <colinclark> hey
2014-05-26T15:02:39 <AndyStiegler> after a bit of puzzeling, we have the smm doing the same on kaspars and my machine and the server, so thats the good news
2014-05-26T15:03:00 <colinclark> And that is throwing an error?
2014-05-26T15:03:02 <colinclark> or something else?
2014-05-26T15:03:14 <AndyStiegler> nope thats correctly giving back a payload
2014-05-26T15:03:46 <AndyStiegler> now when sending a payload the the smm, kaspar noticed that the returned result is lacking an app-settings blob, like here for example
2014-05-26T15:03:47 <AndyStiegler> http://pastebin.com/bmzjzbeV
2014-05-26T15:04:03 <AndyStiegler> settingsHandlers/applicationSettings/...
2014-05-26T15:05:10 <AndyStiegler> what the smm does is taking the prefereces as they arrive, adding a few more from inference, and then passing it on to the flat mm to do the dirty work. thats done here https://github.com/AndreasStiegler/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker2/blob/master/lib/StatisticalMatchMaker.js#L33
2014-05-26T15:05:47 <AndyStiegler> the preferences as created by the smm seem to be in the correct format, but there is no applicationSettings blob.
2014-05-26T15:06:46 <AndyStiegler> i did just set up a fresh clean gpii windows installation. when debuging the login process of sammy (user with magnification settings), i noticed that its also missing an applicationSettings blob, yet the settings are correctly applied. here is sammies mm result: https://www.dropbox.com/s/477n8ne7kv3hqcr/Untitled-2.png
2014-05-26T15:06:49 <colinclark> That sounds like transformation is not occuring
2014-05-26T15:07:03 <colinclark> Have you put a breakpoint in the Transformer component to verify that it is being invoked?
2014-05-26T15:07:09 <AndyStiegler> the smm has only app specific settings so no transformer involved
2014-05-26T15:07:13 * michelled_ joined the channel

2014-05-26T15:07:31 * michelled_ is now known as michelled
2014-05-26T15:07:32 <colinclark> So what \xe2\x80\x9cdirty work\xe2\x80\x9d are you expecting the flat matchmaker to do?
2014-05-26T15:07:46 <michelled> fluid-everyone: would anyone like to join the floe planning meeting?
2014-05-26T15:08:23 <AndyStiegler> i thought its responsible for throwing away the app-specific settings that don\'t match the installed solutions and creating the final result payload
2014-05-26T15:09:08 <AndyStiegler> i wonder of the ApplicationSettings are actually required.. as sammy, as seen on the screenshot, is also lacking them.. but how are his settings returned then? anything i\'m missing?
2014-05-26T15:10:22 <AndyStiegler> i\'m also available for an skye call if thats easier
2014-05-26T15:15:39 <colinclark> AndyStiegler: Can you put a breakpoint in Transformer.js and verify that it is correctly indexing and producing application-specific preferences?
2014-05-26T15:15:51 <colinclark> Line 90 should be a good place to start if you\xe2\x80\x99re using master
2014-05-26T15:16:01 <colinclark> or are you guys now working off the pilots2 branch?
2014-05-26T15:16:32 <AndyStiegler> nope the master. but the smm is not using the transformer, its just calling the dispose strategy as you can see here https://github.com/AndreasStiegler/GPII_StatisticalMatchmaker2/blob/master/lib/StatisticalMatchMaker.js#L33
2014-05-26T15:16:52 <colinclark> AndyStiegler: But you just said you depend on the Flat Matchmaker
2014-05-26T15:16:53 <colinclark> right?
2014-05-26T15:17:21 <AndyStiegler> sorry was unclear. with flat matchmaker i ment its dispose strategy. i thought we considered the transformers to be a generic "tool" in the mm toolbox
2014-05-26T15:17:54 <AndyStiegler> let me summarize it again
2014-05-26T15:18:38 <kasparnet> colinclark, AndyStiegler: I\'m not sure about the applicationSettings blocks, but from what I can tell, the output from the current STMM only results in applications being launched, not any settings being set
2014-05-26T15:18:41 <AndyStiegler> what the smm does is: it takes the preferences and solutions as they are passed. it adds new preferences from statistical inference. it passes both those altered preferences and the solution on to the flat-mm-dispose strategy.
2014-05-26T15:19:05 <colinclark> kasparnet: Presumably that\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s not passing back any settings?
