2014-07-31T18:46:17 <the-t-in-rtf> let me get you a link.
2014-07-31T18:47:10 <the-t-in-rtf> This is the supported one they use to integrate with GitHub and BitBucket

2014-07-31T19:38:21 <cindyli> avtar: the metadata online demo is not working properly. javascript errors at loading http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/html/
2014-07-31T19:38:49 <cindyli> it seems the code base was pulled from the master branch but only part of scripts were updated
2014-07-31T19:39:54 <cindyli> index.html is using the old code while libraries have been updated to the new ones
2014-07-31T19:40:57 <anastasiac> but cindyli, for example master doesn\'t have the pouchDB-min file...
2014-07-31T19:41:03 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/tree/master/src/lib/pouchDB
2014-07-31T19:41:33 <cindyli> anastasiac: yes, the new one is pouuchdb.js, the index.html should reference to that
2014-07-31T19:41:46 <anastasiac> ah, right, I see
2014-07-31T19:45:34 <avtar> cindyli: could you try now?
2014-07-31T19:47:12 <cindyli> avtar: yes, working. thanks!
2014-07-31T19:50:45 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks
2014-07-31T19:51:43 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\'m getting an error in the console related to pouchDB - do you see that also?

2014-07-31T19:52:01 <cindyli> abortError?

2014-07-31T20:01:54 <Bosmon> Is there a JIRA for the "abortError" issue?
2014-07-31T20:02:11 <Bosmon> Also, another error I see is "Media resource https://archive.org/download/gov.ntis.ava11754vnb1/ava11754vnb1_512kb.mp4 could not be decoded."
2014-07-31T20:02:31 <cindyli> no, Bosmon, i can create one.
2014-07-31T20:02:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: the 2nd is \'cuz firefox doesn\'t support mp4
2014-07-31T20:03:35 <cindyli> we have a couple of different video types for that video embedded to support different browsers, Bosmon
2014-07-31T20:05:24 <Bosmon> Thanks
2014-07-31T20:05:51 <cindyli> np
2014-07-31T20:09:41 <Bosmon> Ok cindyli, merging 25 now
2014-07-31T20:09:47 <Bosmon> Thanks for all of your hard work and persistence on this!
2014-07-31T20:10:17 <cindyli> YAY!! THANKS, Bosmon!
2014-07-31T20:10:34 <Bosmon> As for 28, do you think you could add a few blocks to our testing plan to cover the new functionality?
2014-07-31T20:11:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: yes, i certainly can
2014-07-31T20:11:47 <cindyli> Bosmon, anastasiac, i created a jira for AbortError - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-211
2014-07-31T20:12:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks - do we have any insight into what causes the issue?
2014-07-31T20:12:40 <Bosmon> it appears that the error is somehow benign and the component continues to function?
2014-07-31T20:13:03 <cindyli> not yet, i did some search but no luck, pouch db weirdness

2014-07-31T21:05:23 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli - was just reading both of them :)
2014-07-31T21:05:25 <Bosmon> Will test now

2014-07-31T21:05:41 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2014-07-31T21:05:58 <Bosmon> I think the implementation is looking relatively sane now

2014-07-31T12:36:08 <amilchev> hi kasparnet, quick one on unit testing - how do I catch fluid.fail() call? It throws TypeError - should I use http://api.qunitjs.com/throws/ ?

2014-07-31T12:46:57 <kasparnet> amilchev: ugh - I\'m actually not sure .. perhaps cindyli, Bosmon or Justin_o o knows.. I remember wanting to catch a fluid.fail() and not being successful, but I think that was due to the code I was testing running on different kettle instances, etc
2014-07-31T12:48:03 <Justin_o> amilchev: did you try writing it in a try catch block.
2014-07-31T12:48:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: why do you want to catch it?
2014-07-31T12:49:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: were you able to reproduce that issue you were mentioning from the FLOE-206 pull request?
2014-07-31T12:52:31 <cindyli> Justin_o: tried with safari, the master branch, seems unable to reproduce the issue in ur pull request. but i think better try with ff on another machine to confirm
2014-07-31T12:54:16 <amilchev> Justin_o: I just wanted to catch this fluid.fail() call https://github.com/radmanovi4/universal/blob/gpii-539/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L288-L290
2014-07-31T12:55:27 <Justin_o> amilchev: ah you want to test that it actually gets thrown?
2014-07-31T12:55:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: yes
2014-07-31T13:11:02 * kasparnet has quit
2014-07-31T13:14:22 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. did the try catch block work?

2014-07-31T13:24:55 <Bosmon> kasparnet - the point of fluid.fail is not to be caught
2014-07-31T13:25:46 <kasparnet> Bosmon: what if you want to test whether something fails then?
2014-07-31T13:26:00 <Bosmon> kasparnet - please consult the variety of "failure" tests we have for this
2014-07-31T13:26:25 <kasparnet> ok
2014-07-31T13:26:29 <Bosmon> There is a framework utility called "pushSoftFailure" that allows you to temporarily customise the behaviour
2014-07-31T13:26:32 <Bosmon> Let me find you a ref
2014-07-31T13:27:51 <Bosmon> So, here is the simplest kind:
2014-07-31T13:27:52 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L2366
2014-07-31T13:28:17 <Bosmon> This shows a single test customising the behaviour, catching an exception, verifying a message text, and then restoring the old handler
2014-07-31T13:29:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you have a  chance to look over the FLOE-194 pull request again today. I\'m pretty close to needing some of the functionality from it in another branch I\'m working on
2014-07-31T13:30:11 <Bosmon> 194 .......
2014-07-31T13:30:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/28
2014-07-31T13:30:21 <Bosmon> Thanks
2014-07-31T13:30:35 <Bosmon> Oh yes, that one
2014-07-31T13:30:53 <Bosmon> Does https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/25 not have to go in first?
2014-07-31T13:31:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t think so, but it would be good for that one to go in ASAP too so we can cleanup the repo
2014-07-31T13:31:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: is that all correct?
2014-07-31T13:31:53 <Bosmon> I should be able to merge 25 very shortly
2014-07-31T13:32:03 <Bosmon> Are there any conflicts or other dependencies expected between 25 and 28?
2014-07-31T13:32:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: awesome thanks
2014-07-31T13:32:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you know?
2014-07-31T13:33:19 <cindyli> Bosmon, Justin_o, i just merged Justin_o\'s pull request for FLOE-206 into the master and solving conflicts merging the master into 25 and 28, will let you know when it\'s done
2014-07-31T13:33:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks
2014-07-31T13:34:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: there are no dependencies betw 25 and 28, but there should be conflicts merging them together
2014-07-31T13:34:35 <cindyli> so, will need to solve conflicts when one gets in
2014-07-31T13:34:44 <cindyli> but doesn\'t matter which one goes in first
2014-07-31T13:35:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - how do you feel about putting the "isActive" flag into the model?
2014-07-31T13:36:02 <Bosmon> for pull 28
2014-07-31T13:37:32 <cindyli> Bosmon: that flag is not supposed to receive the external value.
2014-07-31T13:37:48 <cindyli> in that case, is it ok to have it in the model?
2014-07-31T13:38:49 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you didn\'t see, Bosmon and kasparnet talked about what to do for the fluid.fail early in the chat
2014-07-31T13:39:17 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-07-31T13:40:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - certainly
2014-07-31T13:40:21 <Bosmon> The general contract for our components is that "all mutable values should be stored in a model"
2014-07-31T13:40:31 <Bosmon> Until recently our ChangeApplier wasn\'t good enough to always make this convenient
2014-07-31T13:41:05 <cindyli> ok, will make the change, Bosmon
2014-07-31T13:41:15 <Bosmon> But now we have pretty solid means for declarative configuration to cover all common cases
2014-07-31T13:41:43 <Bosmon> So it is now probably time to cease randomly storing mutable values on our top-level component objects
2014-07-31T13:41:56 <Bosmon> michelled - this is perhaps worth raising as a documentation/code style point as well
2014-07-31T13:42:18 <Bosmon> As well as making use of the "relay" grades, all new code should also be using these grades to store all mutable values in models

2014-07-31T14:36:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay cool
2014-07-31T14:37:32 <amilchev> because of the lack of need to evaluate variable as option key, since all keys (with adjuster names) are known

2014-07-31T15:55:31 <cindyli> Bosmon, Justin_o, anastasiac, one question about our component API, my use case is that, when an dialog opens or closes, onDialogOpen or onDialogClose event will be fired. meantime, a model value "isDialogOpen" gets updated. so basically these 2 methods are doing the same thing, what\'s more important in this case is to keep the model state. my question is, shall I remove onDialogOpen or onDialogClose events. they seem useful and easier to un
2014-07-31T15:56:26 <Justin_o> cindyli: from my perspective i\'m fine with just listening to the model changed events.
2014-07-31T15:56:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s always great when you can eliminate events in favor of the change API
2014-07-31T15:57:25 <cindyli> ok, removing those events

2014-07-31T16:22:38 <colinclark> I only have a few minutes before I need to dive back into grant writing, but we could chat briefly about it now if it\'s interesting
