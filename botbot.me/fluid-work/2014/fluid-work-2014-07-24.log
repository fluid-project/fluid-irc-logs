b'2014-07-24T16:55:19 <jhernandez> Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49 is ready for another review
2014-07-24T16:55:20 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T16:55:23 <jhernandez> clown: ;)
2014-07-24T16:56:16 <clown> You want me to review it?  Aren\'t I biased?
2014-07-24T16:56:47 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-24T16:57:23 <jhernandez> it\'s our pull request, which was being reviewed by Bosmon
2014-07-24T16:57:41 <jhernandez> it\'s not fair to review our own code, isn\'t it? :P
2014-07-24T16:58:09 <jhernandez> leaving now
2014-07-24T16:58:20 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T16:58:31 <clown> so, you want me to ping Bosmon?
2014-07-24T17:00:02 <jhernandez> doesn\'t "18:55 < jhernandez> Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49 is ready for another review" look like a reasonable ping?
2014-07-24T17:00:06 <jhernandez> xD
2014-07-24T17:00:30 <clown> yes, but you simply can\'t ping Bosmon enough.
2014-07-24T17:00:44 <clown> he loves the attention, doesn\'t he?
2014-07-24T17:00:54 <jhernandez> hahahaha
2014-07-24T17:01:53 <clown> okay jhernandez, I\'ll see what comments are made and try to respond.
2014-07-24T17:03:00 <clown> like he already has...
2014-07-24T17:03:09 <clown> but, lunch first.

2014-07-24T18:25:54 <cindyli> vjoanna: what labels do you wanna have for happy face, sad face and request buttons?

2014-07-24T18:48:50 <vjoanna> cindyli: I added the labels to this page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Metadata+Feedback danaayotte_ what do you think
2014-07-24T18:49:18 <vjoanna> could we also use these labels as tooltips?
2014-07-24T18:54:22 <danaayotte_> vjoanna cindyli I think "show content contributions"  might be clearer if it were "show contributions from others" or something like that?
2014-07-24T18:55:38 <danaayotte_> and maybe "Content needs improvements, provide feedback" for the sad face button
2014-07-24T18:56:00 <danaayotte_> vjoanna ^
2014-07-24T18:58:07 <danaayotte_> vjoanna: and for preference unavailable status how about "transcripts are not available" or "this content has no transcripts"
2014-07-24T18:58:20 <danaayotte_> (I prefer the latter)
2014-07-24T18:58:46 <vjoanna> danaayotte_ the contributions one sounds clearer - the sad face label makes sense too but it won\'t be consistent with happy face label?
2014-07-24T18:59:02 <danaayotte_> yeah
2014-07-24T18:59:06 <danaayotte_> ...
2014-07-24T18:59:18 <danaayotte_> I think that\'s Ok
2014-07-24T18:59:31 <cindyli1> vjoanna, danaayotte_ and Justin_o, yes, we can add these labels as tooltips.
2014-07-24T19:01:34 * yzen_ joined the channel
2014-07-24T19:01:39 <danaayotte_> vjoanna: I\'m thinking it\'s more accurate/descriptive.  and therefore more important than i like/i don\'t like consistency
2014-07-24T19:03:17 <vjoanna> yeah, I think we should still phrase it like an action than just a statement
2014-07-24T19:04:23 * yzen has quit
2014-07-24T19:04:36 <vjoanna> Also if we keep a similar format, I think it will be more clear that they\'re toggles

2014-07-24T20:26:28 <cindyli1> vjoanna: if users click on the happy face button, the dialog appears, meantime, the hover is on so the tooltip is still showing. how do we deal with the overlapping btw the tooltip and the dialog?
2014-07-24T20:30:24 <vjoanna> oh - the hover will still be showing, but the tooltip will disappear if the dialog opens
2014-07-24T20:31:22 <vjoanna> if that\'s possible? cindyli1
2014-07-24T20:32:19 <cindyli1> ok. thanks, vjoanna

2014-07-24T15:43:38 <clown> the PackageKit dbus service.

2014-07-24T15:54:33 <jhernandez> lines 117 and 145
2014-07-24T15:54:35 <jhernandez> I was right
2014-07-24T15:56:33 <jhernandez> the thing is, I\'m not sure whether it\'s a bug in our extension or in packageKit
2014-07-24T15:56:52 <jhernandez> I\'m quite confused with pkcon output when running pkcon search name tuxguitar
2014-07-24T15:57:28 <jhernandez> because it doesn\'t show the same package in both lists
2014-07-24T15:57:32 <clown> jhernandez:  yay, now you are as baffled as I was yesterday.
2014-07-24T15:58:00 <clown> I *think* there are two packages with the same name, version, and arch, but from two different repositories.
2014-07-24T15:59:12 <clown> and, I *think*, you have installed one of them, so it\'s marked "installed", and the other one is still "avaialble" from the other repository.  But, that\'s pure speculation on my part.
2014-07-24T16:00:24 <jhernandez> nope, same provider (repo)
2014-07-24T16:00:43 <clown> okay. hmmmm...
2014-07-24T16:01:01 <jhernandez> soo ...
2014-07-24T16:01:09 <clown> then, I\'m more inclined to blame packagekit, but I\'m not sure.
2014-07-24T16:01:26 <jhernandez> how do you feel about disabling those two asserts by now?
2014-07-24T16:01:39 <jhernandez> (lines 117 and 145)
2014-07-24T16:02:00 <clown> so that we have, as Bosmon said yesterday, 9 out of 10 tests passing?  :-)
2014-07-24T16:02:43 <jhernandez> they\'re all passing!
2014-07-24T16:02:51 <jhernandez> All tests concluded: 7/7 total passed in 44618ms - PASS
2014-07-24T16:02:56 <jhernandez> before, we had 9
2014-07-24T16:03:14 <clown> if they are all passing, why do you need to comment anything out?
2014-07-24T16:03:32 <clown> Oh\xe2\x80\xa6 they all pass *when* you comment out two of the tests...
2014-07-24T16:03:55 <jhernandez> yes!
2014-07-24T16:03:57 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T16:04:02 <clown> okay, that\'s 7 out of 9.
2014-07-24T16:04:18 <jhernandez> the point is, if tuxguitar is installed, then 7 tests will be run
2014-07-24T16:04:32 <jhernandez> if it\'s not, it\'ll run 9
2014-07-24T16:05:11 <jhernandez> just tested that and all are passing in these two situations
2014-07-24T16:05:20 <clown> I think I need to see the changes to fully understand.
2014-07-24T16:05:32 * colinclark has left the channel
2014-07-24T16:05:48 * slim_ joined the channel
2014-07-24T16:05:50 <jhernandez> ok, let me create a pastie with a diff
2014-07-24T16:06:05 <clown> someting is weird if packagekit is showing the same package in the installed vs. available lists (that\'s contradictory).
2014-07-24T16:06:15 <jhernandez> http://pastie.org/private/cmrlozphq0mtwl8wjzpva
2014-07-24T16:06:30 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s really weird
2014-07-24T16:07:29 * slim__ joined the channel
2014-07-24T16:07:47 <jhernandez> and I would have to go through the changes that happened between 0.8.11 and 0.8.17
2014-07-24T16:07:59 <clown> my inclination is to ditch tuxguitar here and go for something more common like glib, or maybe even packagkit-glib.
2014-07-24T16:08:06 <clown> for those couple of tests.
2014-07-24T16:08:20 * danaayotte has quit
2014-07-24T16:08:50 <clown> can you fire up the add-on and run searchPackage() to see what you get on your system for \'glib2\'?
2014-07-24T16:09:01 <jhernandez> I\'m afraid that we will face the same problem, but I was going to do that
2014-07-24T16:09:03 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-07-24T16:09:15 <clown> yah I hear you.
2014-07-24T16:09:22 <clown> still, I wonder....
2014-07-24T16:10:23 <clown> I don\'t know if this matters, but pkcon uses the PkClient object.  Our add on uses the PkTask object.

2014-07-24T16:10:35 * michelled has quit
2014-07-24T16:10:41 * clown is possibly grasping at straws.
2014-07-24T16:10:50 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T16:10:55 <jhernandez> I was thinking the same
2014-07-24T16:11:06 <jhernandez> and ... yeah, same problem with glib2
2014-07-24T16:11:29 <clown> it shows up in both the installed and availalbe lists \xe2\x80\x94 the same version and arch?
2014-07-24T16:11:38 <jhernandez> same version is being listed on both installed and available
2014-07-24T16:11:47 <clown> arrgghhh!!!
2014-07-24T16:11:54 <jhernandez> yeah, same version and same arch
2014-07-24T16:11:58 <jhernandez> but different data
2014-07-24T16:12:05 <jhernandez> (of course)
2014-07-24T16:12:06 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-24T16:12:25 <clown> what is the difference in the data (installed vs. repo-oss)?
2014-07-24T16:12:34 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T16:13:06 <clown> but pkcon is more rational?
2014-07-24T16:13:28 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T16:13:32 <jhernandez> pkcon works fine
2014-07-24T16:14:16 <jhernandez> I\'ll see the differences between versions ... specially around (pktask)
2014-07-24T16:14:36 <clown> I have time to rework the c++ code to use PkClient instead, or simply investigate this further.  A problem is I can\'t test it unless I set up an openSUSE machine (that\'s what you are using, right?)
2014-07-24T16:16:21 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T16:17:09 <jhernandez> right now, I\'m trying to figure out if the problem is with pktask or something else
2014-07-24T16:17:23 <clown> okay.

2014-07-24T16:30:35 <jhernandez> clown: couldn\'t find any evidence, so perhaps it\'s related to the backend
2014-07-24T16:31:13 <clown> what does openSUSE use?  apt?
2014-07-24T16:31:23 <jhernandez> zypper
2014-07-24T16:31:30 <clown> neat name!
2014-07-24T16:31:33 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T16:32:46 <clown> so, what does zypper -info tuxguitar report?  (If that\'s how you invoke zypper).
2014-07-24T16:34:11 <clown> actually, that wouldn\'t explain the difference between "pkcon search name" and our searchName() function.
2014-07-24T16:34:15 <jhernandez> just one installed tuxguitar
2014-07-24T16:34:26 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T16:36:14 <clown> the source for pkcon just does a call to pk_task_search_names_async ().
2014-07-24T16:37:04 <clown> the signatures for pktask and pkclient look identifcal...

2014-07-24T16:44:04 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T16:44:11 <jhernandez> look at the commiter
2014-07-24T16:44:15 <jhernandez> @suse
2014-07-24T16:44:18 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T16:44:29 <jhernandez> it was solved last month
2014-07-24T16:44:31 <clown> that was a month ago.
2014-07-24T16:44:33 <clown> right.
2014-07-24T16:44:35 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-24T16:46:53 <jhernandez> ok, so, I\'ll merge your pull request as it is right now
2014-07-24T16:47:17 <clown> really?
2014-07-24T16:47:26 <clown> thanks!
2014-07-24T16:48:07 <jhernandez> yes, I\'ll submit this patch into our openSUSE\'s current version of packageKit
2014-07-24T16:48:15 <clown> so:  it\'s a fix that\'s coming in zypper?  Or in packagekkit (the zypper backend)? Or both?
2014-07-24T16:48:23 <jhernandez> this patch = https://gitorious.org/packagekit/packagekit/commit/ab86cb3ce70e640dd4679260c83abc3b2e86196a
2014-07-24T16:48:55 <jhernandez> into packageKit\'s zypper backend
2014-07-24T16:51:09 <clown> jhernandez:  I may try this out on ubuntu, if I can find a machine and set it up quickly.
2014-07-24T16:52:19 <jhernandez> that would be great
2014-07-24T16:52:48 <jhernandez> but I\'m sure that both yum and apt are the backends that receive more love
2014-07-24T16:52:55 <jhernandez> xD
2014-07-24T16:53:12 <jhernandez> have to leave now
2014-07-24T16:53:42 <clown> okay.  have a good evening then.
2014-07-24T16:53:49 <jhernandez> but I\'ll try to add this patch into our current version of openSUSE tomorrow morning
2014-07-24T16:53:51 <clown> thanks for your input.
2014-07-24T16:53:56 <jhernandez> thanks to you!!
2014-07-24T16:53:57 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T16:54:59 <jhernandez> oh, the last thing ..
2014-07-24T16:55:08 <clown> yes???

2014-07-24T13:03:57 <Bosmon> I have a working PUL request for you now
2014-07-24T13:04:00 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/552/files#diff-2829282b19942f93881f61ac487dad30R1668
2014-07-24T13:04:14 <Bosmon> You can see the new and vastly simplified configuration here : P
2014-07-24T13:04:37 <cindyli> that\'s great. thanks, Bosmon, will try it soon

2014-07-24T13:21:44 <vjoanna> Justin_o: Sorry, I won\'t be - going to be on vacation
2014-07-24T13:22:38 <Justin_o> vjoanna: okay, no problem, thanks for letting me know
2014-07-24T13:26:08 <danaayotte> Justin_o I think I\'m going to be away too.  How about the following week?
2014-07-24T13:39:35 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey!
2014-07-24T13:40:20 <Bosmon> VERNNANDDEZ!
2014-07-24T13:40:20 <jhernandez> sure
2014-07-24T13:40:23 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-24T13:40:53 <jhernandez> as I said yesterday, universal\'s tests finished well, but I can\'t say the same for linux\' tests :/
2014-07-24T13:41:10 <Bosmon> Yes well
2014-07-24T13:41:13 <Bosmon> what can you say for them?
2014-07-24T13:41:53 <jhernandez> now it\'s failing at a different point
2014-07-24T13:44:09 <jhernandez> before, os_win7 was guilty, now I\'m having problems with os_gnome
2014-07-24T13:45:16 <jhernandez> so I\'ll try to figure out why
2014-07-24T13:45:48 <jhernandez> then, I\'ll be back to you
2014-07-24T13:45:51 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T13:45:52 * michelled joined the channel
2014-07-24T13:48:35 <Justin_o> @cindyli I added a comment about the test framework to my pull request
2014-07-24T13:48:51 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2014-07-24T13:49:16 <Bosmon> jhernandez - actually I can reproduce some failure
2014-07-24T13:49:22 <Bosmon> Looks like I had a dirty file in my linux checkout
2014-07-24T13:49:30 <Bosmon> But for me the failure is with os_common, not with os_gnome
2014-07-24T13:49:33 <Bosmon> Could you double-check?
2014-07-24T13:50:38 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T13:50:44 <jhernandez> both of them
2014-07-24T13:50:59 <jhernandez> and the reason is showCrosshairs ...
2014-07-24T13:51:12 <jhernandez> in both of them
2014-07-24T13:51:42 <jhernandez> the point is that show-corss-hairs is not included neither in os_gnome nor os_common
2014-07-24T13:52:02 <jhernandez> and I\'m a bit confused about that
2014-07-24T13:52:41 <Bosmon> for me show-cross-hairs is fine
2014-07-24T13:52:49 <Bosmon> It is false in both expected and actual
2014-07-24T13:53:03 <Bosmon> The failure I get is in os_common with "text-scaling-factor"
2014-07-24T13:53:12 <Bosmon> Expected 0.75 but actual is 1
2014-07-24T13:54:04 <jhernandez> MMM
2014-07-24T13:54:23 <jhernandez> different issue, even more fun!
2014-07-24T13:54:56 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ll do a fresh checkout
2014-07-24T13:54:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: your pull request works perfectly. commenting on the pull
2014-07-24T13:56:19 <michelled> Bosmon: if you have some time today, can you talk me through your pull requests?
2014-07-24T13:56:25 <michelled> it would be really great to get them in
2014-07-24T13:56:46 <Bosmon> michelled - sure
2014-07-24T13:56:49 <jhernandez> Bosmon: heh, manually changed my show-cross-hairs to false and now I\'m getting a similar problem with scaling-factor
2014-07-24T13:57:00 <Bosmon> Just give me a few minutes to check up on VANTUNEZ issue
2014-07-24T13:57:44 <jhernandez> BUT, in my case, expected 0.75, got 0.8
2014-07-24T13:57:45 <jhernandez> xD
2014-07-24T13:58:18 <michelled> Bosmon: I have a meeting now anyway
2014-07-24T13:58:24 <michelled> it will have to be in the afternoon
2014-07-24T13:59:43 * clown joined the channel
2014-07-24T14:00:21 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2014-07-24T14:01:14 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hmm
2014-07-24T14:01:31 <jhernandez> I reverted your change on that transformation
2014-07-24T14:01:40 <jhernandez> AND, now it passes
2014-07-24T14:01:53 <Bosmon> the quantize one?
2014-07-24T14:02:02 <jhernandez> nope
2014-07-24T14:02:05 <jhernandez> the other one
2014-07-24T14:02:05 <Bosmon> I am still struggling to add my own repository as a remote
2014-07-24T14:02:11 <jhernandez> it\'s a binary -> lineatr
2014-07-24T14:02:13 <Bosmon> It has taken me about 20 minutes now
2014-07-24T14:02:38 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/264/files#diff-590f594c6f8e3eac80d2956870ac3e02L157
2014-07-24T14:02:41 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2014-07-24T14:02:43 <michelled> you probably need to \'prune\' your repo
2014-07-24T14:02:50 <michelled> since it probably still has the horrible branch in it
2014-07-24T14:03:29 <Bosmon> michelled - so far I have not been able to find a URL for it that does not want me to authenticate
2014-07-24T14:03:40 <Bosmon> I guess since github believes that I am me, it only gives me the auth-enabled ones
2014-07-24T14:04:30 <jhernandez> Bosmon: STOP BREAKING THINGS ANTVANIG!
2014-07-24T14:04:45 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-24T14:05:15 <Bosmon> What in hell
2014-07-24T14:05:18 <Bosmon> No wonder I can\'t clone it
2014-07-24T14:05:22 <Bosmon> It seems that it doesn\'t exist : P
2014-07-24T14:05:29 <Bosmon> I have never made a fork of GPII linux ....
2014-07-24T14:05:32 <Bosmon> fine
2014-07-24T14:18:08 * slim_ joined the channel
2014-07-24T14:23:55 <Bosmon> Ok jhernandez - I fixed the text-scaling-factor issue in my GPII-873 branch
2014-07-24T14:24:00 <Bosmon> Could you check out again and retest?
2014-07-24T14:24:06 <Bosmon> So far I can\'t reproduce the show-cross-hairs issue
2014-07-24T14:36:43 <jhernandez> Bosmon: the point is that this setting is not being included into os_common and os_gnome sets
2014-07-24T14:37:00 <Bosmon> Well, can you paste me your complete logs again
2014-07-24T14:37:11 <jhernandez> I\'m trying to find where is that coming from
2014-07-24T14:37:18 <Bosmon> I can\'t see how you can get different results to me for this
2014-07-24T14:37:23 <Bosmon> Are you sure your working copy has no dirty files?
2014-07-24T14:37:26 <jhernandez> nope
2014-07-24T14:38:19 <jhernandez> if you want to reproduce it, I\'m sure that "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier show-cross-hairs true" will make your tests failing
2014-07-24T14:38:24 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-24T14:39:28 <jhernandez> btw, no dirty files
2014-07-24T14:39:29 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-24T14:42:03 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I remember that I added this setting to our tests, BUT finally it didn\'t get included/accepted as common term for this 2nd pilot phase
2014-07-24T14:43:13 <jhernandez> I\'m trying to find where/when this happened, still looking for it
2014-07-24T14:45:09 <jhernandez> in any case, the fix for our acceptance tests looks perfect to me
2014-07-24T14:45:35 <jhernandez> will add a comment on that pull request
2014-07-24T14:45:51 <Bosmon> jhernandez - the old tests would fail in this case as well
2014-07-24T14:45:58 <Bosmon> And in fact, since the beginning of time
2014-07-24T14:46:06 <Bosmon> So I think that no new problem has been introduced
2014-07-24T14:46:08 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T14:46:12 <jhernandez> that\'s the point
2014-07-24T14:46:18 <Bosmon> ok well
2014-07-24T14:46:25 <Bosmon> We can write up a separate JIRA for this issue
2014-07-24T14:46:29 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-24T14:46:32 <jhernandez> I\'ll do that
2014-07-24T14:46:35 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-07-24T14:46:35 <Bosmon> Thanks
2014-07-24T14:46:42 <Bosmon> Please try to make it intelligible : P

2014-07-24T15:21:43 <Bosmon> Thanks, jhernandez - it consists of several sentences in a connected sequence!

2014-07-24T15:25:22 <jhernandez> xDDDDDDD
2014-07-24T15:26:14 <jhernandez> Bosmon: because of you, I\'m improving my humble english :P :P

2014-07-24T15:27:25 <colinclark> man, jhernandez and Bosmon, I love reading emails like this: "Tests are passing again under GNU/Linux - yay!"
2014-07-24T15:27:39 <Bosmon> jhernandez - we are quite capable of getting terrible JIRAs from those with English as a first language : P
2014-07-24T15:28:13 <jhernandez> xDDDDDD
2014-07-24T15:28:30 <jhernandez> colinclark: heh
2014-07-24T15:28:40 <jhernandez> it\'s Bosmon\'s magic!
2014-07-24T15:30:07 <colinclark> Bosmon: We have some really nice JIRAs, too
2014-07-24T15:30:26 <colinclark> ones filled with voluminous details, interesting commentary, and references to other JIRAs
2014-07-24T15:30:41 <colinclark> those ones are cool
2014-07-24T15:31:32 <jhernandez> c\'mon guys! the JIRA of the week is this one -> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-762 :P :P
2014-07-24T15:35:04 <jhernandez> clown_mtg: when you\'re back, I\'d like to talk to you about https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/pull/11
2014-07-24T15:35:34 <jhernandez> bascially, version of packageKit?
