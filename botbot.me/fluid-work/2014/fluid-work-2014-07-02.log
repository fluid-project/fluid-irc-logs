2014-07-02T14:44:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello, are you there?
2014-07-02T14:44:35 <amilchev> hi Justin_o, yep
2014-07-02T14:44:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: just double checking.. should i be testing out all your pull requests with the pilots2 branch of gpii?
2014-07-02T14:45:27 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-07-02T14:45:28 <amilchev> Justin_o: umm no, just the one for the websockets
2014-07-02T14:46:02 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay... which branch do the other ones work with?
2014-07-02T14:46:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: you can test GPII-752 and GPII-839 with master branches I guess
2014-07-02T14:47:05 <amilchev> Justin_o: they don\'t relate to anything specific from pilots2 of universal
2014-07-02T14:48:00 <amilchev> Justin_o: were you able to test the websockets communication?
2014-07-02T14:48:24 <amilchev> whether it actually applies any change or not.. :)
2014-07-02T14:49:19 <Justin_o> amilchev: I had tested this previously, but reverted back the branch change for the other related pull request.
2014-07-02T14:49:26 <Justin_o> it had seemed to be working
2014-07-02T14:50:09 <amilchev> Justin_o: thx, that\'s good to hear..
2014-07-02T15:07:05 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-07-02T15:14:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m trying to use the master branch of gpii.. but am finding that the settings don\'t get applied.. i tried using the production and dev modes for pmt/pcp
2014-07-02T15:15:13 <Justin_o> amilchev: was it working for you?
2014-07-02T15:16:05 <amilchev> Justin_o: by master branch of gpii you mean master of universal?
2014-07-02T15:20:58 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes that\'s right
2014-07-02T15:21:20 <amilchev> Justin_o: well I\'ve actually never managed to even log a user in using master
2014-07-02T15:21:45 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. well i guess that explains things :)
2014-07-02T15:21:59 <amilchev> Justin_o: I\'m not sure what config should be used .. don\'t know what value of global NODE_ENV should be set
2014-07-02T15:22:07 <Justin_o> amilchev: so when you were testing you were just seeing if the messages showed up for GPII-752?
2014-07-02T15:22:18 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.
2014-07-02T15:22:37 <amilchev> Justin_o: yes, exactly..
2014-07-02T15:23:04 <Justin_o> amilchev: i also tried GPII-752 with pilots2, some of the messages don\'t get displayed because of the page reloads or rerendering.
2014-07-02T15:23:42 <amilchev> Justin_o: hm.. why does it reload?
2014-07-02T15:24:06 <Justin_o> amilchev: i guess it\'s applying the settings.. it my just be rerendering
2014-07-02T15:24:41 <amilchev> Justin_o, I guess I need to try this as well
2014-07-02T15:24:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes, please.. thanks..
2014-07-02T15:25:05 <Justin_o> I\'ll leave a comment on the pull request
2014-07-02T15:25:43 <amilchev> Justin_o: sorry for not testing in the first place - I thought that if the events that correspond to the messages are fired correctly, then they\'ll be shown correctly as well :)
2014-07-02T15:26:28 <amilchev> Justin_o: thanks, I\'ll reply in the comments whenever ready with improvement or question
2014-07-02T15:26:39 <Justin_o> amilchev: no problem, and sounds good.

2014-07-02T18:50:23 <slim> kasparnet: hey - I just replied to the latest minutes as you started to address my Qs
2014-07-02T18:50:52 <slim> Main issue is how does PMT communicate with a windows program to write tags
2014-07-02T18:51:05 <slim> and also linux etc if also required
2014-07-02T18:51:19 <slim> shame I missed the meeting
2014-07-02T18:52:56 <kasparnet> slim: yeah - you didn\'t miss that much in the meeting, cause we weren\'t sure about that issue at all either
2014-07-02T18:53:32 <kasparnet> so michelle will talk to the PMT/PCP folks tomorrow and check whether the PMT will have contact with the installed flow manager
2014-07-02T18:53:59 <slim> hehe! I\'ll park it for mo then.
2014-07-02T18:54:01 <kasparnet> it will then be the job of the local GPII system (ie. flowmanager) to talk with the RFID/USBs
2014-07-02T18:54:03 <slim> sounds good
2014-07-02T18:54:23 <kasparnet> slim: and Javi and Hens were gonna do some thinking and adding details to the JIRA
2014-07-02T18:54:32 <slim> cool
2014-07-02T18:54:34 <kasparnet> and we\'ll pick it up next architecture meeting again
2014-07-02T18:55:05 <slim> btw I finally have a mingw build - took ages and much reminding myself how dll linkage works and other low level pain.
2014-07-02T18:55:19 <slim> now need to relearn gdb text debugger :(
2014-07-02T18:55:36 <slim> so now I can fix ntags etc
2014-07-02T18:56:25 <slim> kasparnet: I see you sent another email re Checkpoint1. I think I have done all you need?
2014-07-02T18:58:54 <slim> kasparnet: correction - I have done all you need *for Checkpoint 1* only. Will do rest later
