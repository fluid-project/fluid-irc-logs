2014-06-02T13:32:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: you might find this issue thread on bower interesting. It covers the issues we will have with creating a bower package for Infusion. Unfortuntely it was closed as won\'t fix, but there is a lot of discussion with two in particular that should help us to formulate a strategy. https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/24
2014-06-02T13:33:39 <Justin_o> Here are what i think are the most useful comments to us https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/24#issuecomment-14334571 and https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/24#issuecomment-14344717
2014-06-02T13:33:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2014-06-02T13:33:56 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2014-06-02T13:33:59 <colinclark> i\xe2\x80\x99m just reading it

2014-06-02T13:35:53 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m only midway through it
2014-06-02T13:35:59 <colinclark> but it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly depressing commentary
2014-06-02T13:36:08 <colinclark> with people making blanket statements about how people should do things
2014-06-02T13:36:12 <colinclark> \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\'s better if a repo equals a component."
2014-06-02T13:36:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep.. in some cases i\'m sure that\'s true, but i think it is an over generalization
2014-06-02T13:37:04 <colinclark> Yep
2014-06-02T13:37:28 <colinclark> I think they key point is whether you think you, as a developer, are in a position to tell developers what they should do in the abstract
2014-06-02T13:37:55 <colinclark> especially when it\xe2\x80\x99s clear it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a black and white decision
2014-06-02T13:38:49 <colinclark> as opposed to supporting a user\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtful choices

2014-06-02T14:49:41 <colinclark> Justin_o: If nothing else, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just learned about the link command for npm and Bower
2014-06-02T14:49:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: :)
2014-06-02T14:50:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: i hadn\'t heard about that before either
2014-06-02T14:51:02 <colinclark> it sounds like it will take away some of the pain of constantally having to npm install a module to test it
2014-06-02T14:51:21 <colinclark> bower is even worse, since it will refuse to reinstall a component if it already exists
2014-06-02T14:51:51 <colinclark> so if you installed it from a remote git repo, then make changes to a local clone of it, and type \xe2\x80\x9cbower install ../mymodule\xe2\x80\x9d it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to work
2014-06-02T14:51:55 <colinclark> whereas npm knows what to do

2014-06-02T16:22:16 <jhung> michelled, Justin_o - I have no objections to using DocPad for the Floe site as well. I can pair with anastasiac on that to spread out some of the DocPad knowledge. We should probably look into implementing a mobile design as well\xe2\x80\xa6 probably means adding Foundation to the mix.
