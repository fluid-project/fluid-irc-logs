2014-10-08T15:30:20 <Bosmon> Should be fairly conventional problems from now on....
2014-10-08T15:32:55 <Bosmon> amilchev - check your markup against this test fixture

2014-10-08T12:51:10 <amilchev> hey Justin_o
2014-10-08T12:54:12 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello
2014-10-08T13:01:43 * heidiv joined the channel
2014-10-08T13:07:27 <amilchev> Justin_o: following up on the "pok" error I asked you about
2014-10-08T13:07:51 <amilchev> and trying to make an assertion be made upon another component\'s "onReady" event happening
2014-10-08T13:08:31 <Justin_o> okay
2014-10-08T13:08:41 * anvk joined the channel
2014-10-08T13:10:26 <amilchev> so the example you gave me
2014-10-08T13:11:22 <amilchev> I understand as
2014-10-08T13:12:06 <amilchev> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/TestingTests.js#L118 - run this test when the onReady event of initTest (which is a subcomp of initTree) is fired
2014-10-08T13:12:27 <amilchev> and
2014-10-08T13:13:03 <amilchev> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/TestingTests.js#L80-L83 - the subcomponent initTest declaration, will be created when onTestCaseStart gets fired
2014-10-08T13:13:55 <Justin_o> yes that\'s right
2014-10-08T13:14:59 <amilchev> but in my case I\'m not waiting for a subcomponent to be created, but I\'m waiting for the component which is the analog of  "initTree" here
2014-10-08T13:15:51 <amilchev> to be created, in particular to make sure its member pcp is ready https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-752/tests/js/pcpStatusMessagesTests.js#L23-L39
2014-10-08T13:17:16 <amilchev> and since this is a fluid.prefs.create call, I also want to ensure that the test will be ran after the prefsEditor https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-752/tests/js/pcpStatusMessagesTests.js#L33-L35 is attached to the pcp object
2014-10-08T13:17:34 <amilchev> so that I can call it by "{that}.pcp.prefsEditorLoader.prefsEditor"
2014-10-08T13:20:52 <amilchev> so what should I do - just add "event: "{pcpStatusMessages}.events.onReady" here https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-752/tests/js/pcpStatusMessagesTests.js#L98 ?
2014-10-08T13:22:21 <amilchev> (that didn\'t change anything)
2014-10-08T13:23:31 * slim has quit
2014-10-08T13:31:07 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. i don\'t think this will work :(
2014-10-08T13:31:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have any thoughts to the above ^
2014-10-08T13:31:46 <Justin_o> amilchev: you should really only be adding components in the components block, not the members
2014-10-08T13:32:27 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeah I know, but how do I add
2014-10-08T13:32:51 <amilchev> the result of the fluid.prefs.create func in the components block
2014-10-08T13:33:37 <amilchev> what I generally want is to be able to fire events in the prefsEditor
2014-10-08T13:34:30 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-10-08T13:45:10 <Justin_o> amilchev: you could also just call this fluid.prefs.builder function outside of the test component tree. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Builder.js#L202
2014-10-08T13:45:39 <Justin_o> this will return a grade name that you can use in your test tree in the components block
2014-10-08T13:46:05 <Justin_o> I think this might be a better way... since the fluid.prefs.create isn\'t a real component, i don\'t think you can use it inside of a defaults block.
2014-10-08T13:50:59 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-10-08T14:00:24 <amilchev> Justin_o: cool, let me try that
2014-10-08T14:08:28 * colinclark has quit
2014-10-08T14:12:18 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-10-08T14:26:32 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-10-08T14:28:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: how do I write whatever fluid.prefs.builder returned as a gradeName to a component in the components block?
2014-10-08T14:29:54 <Bosmon> amilchev - you should turn the "pcp" member into a proper subcomponent
2014-10-08T14:30:06 <Bosmon> You can do this by moving the fluid.prefs.create call into an invoker on the top-level component
2014-10-08T14:30:27 <Bosmon> For example, there could be an invoker {pcpStatusMessages}.createPrefs
2014-10-08T14:30:47 <Bosmon> Then you can contribute this invoker name into the grades for the pcp member, which can then become a proper component
2014-10-08T14:30:54 <Bosmon> e.g. components: {
2014-10-08T14:31:02 <Bosmon> pcp: {
2014-10-08T14:31:12 <Bosmon> type: "{pcpStatusMessages}.createPrefs"
2014-10-08T14:31:13 <Bosmon> etc
2014-10-08T14:32:56 <Bosmon> Most of your awkward problems should go away at this point - having a plain "member" which is a full component will create hazards for IoC resolution
2014-10-08T14:33:30 <Bosmon> I guess there is a prefs method which simply returns the grade name rather than the component
2014-10-08T14:33:40 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-10-08T14:35:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks like our "one stop shop" makes one stop too many :)
2014-10-08T14:35:28 <Bosmon> amilchev - take a look at the inside of the "fluid.prefs.create" function - it is in Builder.js line 200
2014-10-08T14:36:01 <amilchev> Bosmon yes, already have
2014-10-08T14:36:09 <Bosmon> Your invoker needs to call fluid.prefs.builder to construct the package including the gradeName
2014-10-08T14:36:23 <Bosmon> And then return the build.options.assembledPrefsEditorGrade name
2014-10-08T14:36:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it just jumps over a few stops :) it\'s kind of like the new subway extension there are planning here where they replace 5 stops with 2
2014-10-08T14:36:47 <Bosmon> Then all the other arguments on line 203 go into your standard component constructor
2014-10-08T14:36:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - exactly : P
2014-10-08T14:37:23 <Bosmon> amilchev just needs to create a short function which "unbundles" these steps - this function isn\'t suitable for IoC-aware users of the component
2014-10-08T14:39:14 <amilchev> Bosmon thanks, trying this out
2014-10-08T14:39:33 <Bosmon> amilchev - thanks
2014-10-08T14:50:28 * colinclark has quit
2014-10-08T14:55:12 <amilchev> Bosmon if this is what you mean http://pastebin.com/8Z9akjVw
2014-10-08T14:55:40 <amilchev> I receive TypeError: Object [object global] has no method \'apply\'
2014-10-08T14:56:02 <Bosmon> amilchev - what is this "doesntmatter" business :)
2014-10-08T14:56:23 <Bosmon> You need to have a properly attached global name
2014-10-08T14:57:28 <Bosmon> Better call it something like "gpii.tests.constructPrefsGrade" or so
2014-10-08T14:57:38 <Bosmon> Unless you bind the name to some already established global namespace, it will just get lost
2014-10-08T14:59:39 <Bosmon> amilchev note that in JS "strict mode" your line 29 is invalid
2014-10-08T14:59:41 <Bosmon> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
2014-10-08T15:00:32 <Bosmon> In that we may no longer create new top-level names without the use of "var"
2014-10-08T15:01:07 <Bosmon> And since in JS you can normally never be completely sure whether your code sits at a really "top-level scope", this is why we make use of the fluid "registerNamespace" directive
2014-10-08T15:01:34 <Bosmon> This ensures that whatever scope a name happens to be in, at least the framework is clear that you mean to create a "global" name in its own global scope
2014-10-08T15:02:26 <amilchev> Bosmon well adding the func in the gpii.tests namespace didn\'t seem to change anything
2014-10-08T15:02:29 <Bosmon> So for example, once the "gpii" name is established by a linkage such as "var gpii = fluid.registerNamespace("gpii")" you are then free to create any subsidiary names safely within  "gpii"
2014-10-08T15:02:34 <amilchev> still getting the same error
2014-10-08T15:03:26 <Bosmon> amilchev - the signature you declared for the function doesn\'t match its usage
2014-10-08T15:03:45 <Bosmon> You have it accepting an argument "that" where you didn\'t supply any
2014-10-08T15:05:37 * michelled has quit
2014-10-08T15:05:45 <Bosmon> Looks like you can just remove the argument since it isn\'t used
2014-10-08T15:07:12 <Bosmon> amilchev - also your usage "{that}.createPrefs" on lin 14 is ambiguous
2014-10-08T15:07:27 <Bosmon> You should clarify by writing "{pcpStatusMessages}.createPrefs"
2014-10-08T15:08:12 <amilchev> Bosmon: I deleted some stuff when pasting in pastebin - here is what I\'m really testing with
2014-10-08T15:08:32 <amilchev> http://pastebin.com/QwNmQMNC
2014-10-08T15:09:17 <Bosmon> amilchev - thanks
2014-10-08T15:09:20 <Bosmon> What do you observe now?
2014-10-08T15:09:40 <amilchev> the global pcpStatusMessages and builder vars are just hooks I wanted to have in the console
2014-10-08T15:09:55 <amilchev> but my point is that I\'m still getting the same error and the invoker func is never called
2014-10-08T15:10:27 <Bosmon> amilchev - can you put a stack trace into pastie?
2014-10-08T15:11:50 <amilchev> Bosmon http://pastebin.com/UMUyJQPe

2014-10-08T15:21:12 <Bosmon> Hi amilchev
2014-10-08T15:21:19 <Bosmon> This looks like a framework bug, which I\'ve reported at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5522
2014-10-08T15:21:30 <Bosmon> In the meantime, can you please try the definition I have written into this stypi:
2014-10-08T15:21:40 <Bosmon> https://code.stypi.com/lmv3xv2h
2014-10-08T15:22:17 <amilchev> Bosmon thanks
2014-10-08T15:24:03 <amilchev> Bosmon does it necessarily need to be a view component?
2014-10-08T15:24:10 <amilchev> since it\'s throwing "empty container" error
2014-10-08T15:24:18 <Bosmon> amilchev - ok
2014-10-08T15:24:26 <Bosmon> sec
2014-10-08T15:24:56 * yzen_ joined the channel
2014-10-08T15:25:26 <Bosmon> amilchev - yes, it does
2014-10-08T15:25:30 <Bosmon> So you will need to supply the container arguments
2014-10-08T15:25:33 <Bosmon> argument
2014-10-08T15:25:58 <Bosmon> Whatever you had previously been sending as the first argument to fluid.prefs.create
2014-10-08T15:26:20 <amilchev> Bosmon ok
2014-10-08T15:27:29 <Bosmon> Looks like it was "#gpiic-pcp"
2014-10-08T15:27:55 <amilchev> Bosmon the error I\'m getting now is "Instantiation of autoInit component with type fluid.prefs.separatedPanel.renderIframe failed, since selector " #gpiic-pcp .flc-prefsEditor-iframe " did not match any markup in the document"
2014-10-08T15:28:07 <Bosmon> amilchev - looks much better
2014-10-08T15:28:17 * yzen has quit
2014-10-08T15:28:27 <amilchev> you can check the code in stypi
