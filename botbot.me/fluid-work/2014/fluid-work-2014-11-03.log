2014-11-03T17:02:16 <ashgotti> Good morning everyone
2014-11-03T17:02:32 <ashgotti> Afternoon actually
2014-11-03T17:18:00 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-11-03T17:21:15 <Justin_o> ashgotti: hello
2014-11-03T17:22:04 <ashgotti> Hi! I\'m trying to build the UIOptions component as a Drupal module and am a bit confused as to how I should do this. I have created my module, loaded the UIOptions JS and CSS files, created my div as per the demo, but I must be missing something
2014-11-03T17:30:51 <Justin_o> ashgotti: what type of error are you getting?
2014-11-03T17:31:24 <ashgotti> Refrence errors like: Uncaught ReferenceError: fluid is not defined
2014-11-03T17:31:32 <ashgotti> I\'m just trying to figure out which files I have to have loaded.
2014-11-03T17:31:38 <Justin_o> ashgotti: I\'m assuming you are using the separated panel version of UIO, with the drop down effect. If that is the case, is there a path issue with the iframe used there?
2014-11-03T17:31:54 <Justin_o> ashgotti: are you using the infusion-all.js file?
2014-11-03T17:32:04 <Justin_o> and which version of Infusion are you working with?
2014-11-03T17:32:47 <ashgotti> Justin_o: I\'m using 1.4. I haven\'t loaded infusion-all.js
2014-11-03T17:34:02 <ashgotti> Thank you for the help btw. The documentation is geared towards node.js
2014-11-03T17:35:27 <Justin_o> no problem... for the documentation did you look at this page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion14/Tutorial+-+Fat+Panel+UI+Options
2014-11-03T17:35:41 <Justin_o> that should give you list of all the files you\'d need to import if you don\'t use the single js file.
2014-11-03T17:36:58 <ashgotti> I didn\'t see this one, no, but a similar one. Thank you! I\'ll take a look. I\'ve spent the better part of my morning on this
2014-11-03T17:37:12 <Justin_o> ashgotti: let me know how it goes..
2014-11-03T17:37:20 <ashgotti> I did try to go http://builder.fluidproject.org/ earlier and it\'s still not resolving for me
2014-11-03T17:37:36 <Justin_o> ashgotti: i should also mention that we have a 1.5 release that you could try as well. it looks quite different.
2014-11-03T17:38:12 <Justin_o> you can see the nightly version here.. it\'s basically the same as the 1.5 version http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/
2014-11-03T17:38:33 <ashgotti> oh ya, that is a bit different

2014-11-03T18:25:46 <ashgotti> The builder doesn\'t exist anymore so I had to download some of the compiled files from the demo version
2014-11-03T18:36:09 <Justin_o> ashgotti: yes, the builder is no longer up. If you are using 1.4 you can use ant to build a custom package. If you are using 1.5 you can use grunt to create a package.
2014-11-03T18:36:28 <ashgotti> Thanks again for the help!
2014-11-03T18:36:51 <Justin_o> ashgotti: no problem.. glad you got it working.. please drop us link to your work when you have a chance
2014-11-03T18:37:48 <ashgotti> Justin_o: you can see it at http://www.lemonlimedesigns.ca just where I was testing. It\'s actually a project for a job I haven\'t started yet. Wanted to take a look before I start. I believe it will be released as a module for Drupal when it\'s done.
2014-11-03T18:40:00 <Justin_o> ashgotti: that\'s great

2014-11-03T20:29:56 <cindyli> jhung1: for the mobile design for the overview panel, regarding "Scroll entire panel", the entire panel means "the close button + title + contents + footer" or without "the close button + title"?
2014-11-03T20:33:01 <jhung1> Entire thing cindyli. Including the header. It\'s just the easiest implementation right now. We can worry about improving the experience when we have more time.
2014-11-03T20:33:41 <cindyli> ok, jhung1, is the star button also included?
2014-11-03T20:34:48 <jhung1> cindyli: yes, that is my thinking.

2014-11-03T14:32:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in regards to the datasource wrapper stuff.. the hash (key) generated from the directModel, does it have to be reversible into it\'s object form. Meaning do i have to generate a string that is parseable by JSON
2014-11-03T14:33:07 * jhung has quit
2014-11-03T14:37:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no - can you think of any use case that would require it to be reversible?
2014-11-03T14:38:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no i couldn\'t but i had started out by trying to preserve things like braces, and it occurred to me that it probably didn\'t really matter
2014-11-03T14:39:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I had imagined that the string would simply hold the shortest possible information that could be proved to be unique
2014-11-03T14:40:23 <Bosmon> For example a string like |a0|true|1|"thing"|2|9|3o|key1|false etc.
2014-11-03T14:41:02 <Bosmon> Imagining the character "a" or "o" determining whether a container is an array or an object
2014-11-03T14:42:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. so if i\'m getting this right the original would have looked like [true, "thing", 9, {key1: false}]
2014-11-03T14:44:10 <Justin_o> i\'ll implement something like that.. i guess it may be a bit different in the end.. but hopefully still unique :)
2014-11-03T14:44:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yeah, something like that

2014-11-03T15:05:32 <jhernandez> SLIM FANDANGO!?
2014-11-03T15:05:33 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-11-03T15:07:11 <slim_jim> hehe - wh yaeveyone shouting?
2014-11-03T15:08:00 <slim_jim> Bosmon: so I need to integrate the Windows screen resolution code into a handler and waned to check a few things.
2014-11-03T15:08:12 <Bosmon> slim_jim - woo!
2014-11-03T15:08:17 <Bosmon> This implies you have some code already? : P
2014-11-03T15:08:58 <slim_jim> 1) what version of GPII windows should I uses? Master? I think Amrish is using Thanos\' nightly which is probably master
2014-11-03T15:09:25 <Bosmon> 1) I didn\'t know we had nightlies - can you tell me about them? : P
2014-11-03T15:09:30 <slim_jim> 2) Where do I hook in and how. You mentionend the SPI handler and ffi?
2014-11-03T15:10:05 <slim_jim> Bosmon: 1) Well thanks said he was generating the msi automatically. in an emial
2014-11-03T15:10:12 <slim_jim> *Thanos
2014-11-03T15:10:30 <Bosmon> 2) here is an example https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/registrySettingsHandler/src/RegistrySettingsHandler.js#L137
2014-11-03T15:11:57 <slim_jim> Bosmon: 1) I can;t find a link but hens might know
2014-11-03T15:13:01 <slim_jim> Bosmon: 2) thanks is that the mysterious ffi? I looked at jhernandez\'s code which is a different tool
2014-11-03T15:13:19 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-11-03T15:13:24 <Bosmon> slim_jim - what can you mean - jhernandez has written some windows code?
2014-11-03T15:13:39 <jhernandez> Bosmon: that never happened!!!
2014-11-03T15:13:41 <jhernandez> NEVER!
2014-11-03T15:13:46 <Bosmon> I was sure of it
2014-11-03T15:13:47 <jhernandez> :P :P
2014-11-03T15:13:55 <slim_jim> Bosmon: NO! SILLY! but he calls out to linux
2014-11-03T15:14:09 <Bosmon> slim_jim - using node_ffi?
2014-11-03T15:14:11 <slim_jim> lol
2014-11-03T15:15:01 <jhernandez> linux use native add-ons, by wrapping platform-specific libraries such as gsettings
2014-11-03T15:15:09 <slim_jim> Bosmon: 1 & 2) so i\'ll follow your example which is on master
2014-11-03T15:15:39 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-11-03T15:16:22 <slim_jim> I assume I just create a new file ScreenResolutionSettingsHandler or should it be more generic - ScreenHandler?
2014-11-03T15:16:46 <slim_jim> jhernandez: why not use ffi? Is it windows only?
2014-11-03T15:18:00 <slim_jim> a so it looks like ffiis simply a ay to bind to DLLs - like VisualBasic proivdes. So not much fun is Linux
2014-11-03T15:18:14 <slim_jim> Bosmon: Is there a good place for ffi docs?
2014-11-03T15:18:25 <jhernandez> slim_jim: we have libffi too, but yeah, as you said, it doesn\'t make sense at all
2014-11-03T15:19:25 <slim_jim> Bosmon: I assume I just create a new file ScreenResolutionSettingsHandler or should it be more generic - ScreenHandler?
2014-11-03T15:20:28 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I can\'t particularly think of any other settings in this category we can handle
2014-11-03T15:20:36 <Bosmon> Have you located the Windows API responsible?
2014-11-03T15:20:40 <Bosmon> What other settings can it deal in?
2014-11-03T15:22:41 <slim_jim> Bosmon: It the DeviceContext Functions set according to MSDN - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183411%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
2014-11-03T15:23:05 <slim_jim> SO others are low level drawing context which we would not use.
2014-11-03T15:23:25 <slim_jim> I happy to call it Device ConextSettingsHandler but hat is not descriptive unless you know windows APIs
2014-11-03T15:23:37 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2014-11-03T15:24:43 <slim_jim> so I\'ll make it DisplaySettingsHandler :)
2014-11-03T15:25:29 <Bosmon> slim_jim - sounds reasonable
2014-11-03T15:25:43 <slim_jim> Bosmon: cool
2014-11-03T15:26:01 <slim_jim> Bosmon: how about a pointer to some good ffi docs in case I need them>

2014-11-03T15:27:04 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/53
2014-11-03T15:27:18 <Bosmon> This will shortly be merged into our master, and updates us to the more recent version of the node_ffi API
2014-11-03T15:27:50 <Bosmon> Here is what they have in terms of docs: https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi/wiki/Node-FFI-Tutorial
2014-11-03T15:28:02 * danaayotte_ has quit
2014-11-03T15:28:48 <slim_jim> Bosmon: Thanks! However I do need make sure it will work on Greggs devices. Will that merge easily?
2014-11-03T15:29:07 <slim_jim> He is going on Weds so it must be easy.
2014-11-03T15:29:08 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-11-03T15:29:13 <slim_jim> so perhasp I should use master?
2014-11-03T15:29:25 <Bosmon> slim_jim - that seems an unfortunately tight timescale
2014-11-03T15:29:28 <simonjb> Bosmon, slim_jim: I\'ve not updated https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/53 in ages
2014-11-03T15:29:32 <Bosmon> Are you sure you can have a working implementation by then?
2014-11-03T15:30:32 <slim_jim> Bosmon: reasonably - I\'m porting simple working C code to JS.
2014-11-03T15:30:38 <slim_jim> A fall back is to call the command line exe from the handler?
2014-11-03T15:30:46 <slim_jim> simonjb: thanks
2014-11-03T15:30:51 <Bosmon> slim_jim - you could do that
2014-11-03T15:31:06 <slim_jim> good
2014-11-03T15:31:46 <slim_jim> Bosmon: so master or 53? given we don;t know what is on Gregs device?
2014-11-03T15:32:47 <Bosmon> slim_jim - this doesn\'t sound to me like something we can necessarily expect to get working by Wendesday
2014-11-03T15:33:07 <Bosmon> I think Gregg should have brought this requirement into our engineering planning process at an earlier date, if he expected it to be ready on such a timescale
2014-11-03T15:34:32 * anvk has quit
2014-11-03T15:35:16 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I imagine if you wanted a completely immediate solution, you could encode this solution as a raw "lifecycle action"
2014-11-03T15:35:31 <Bosmon> For example you can execute arbitrary processes as encoded in the solutions registry as here:
2014-11-03T15:35:32 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json#L57
2014-11-03T15:35:42 <slim_jim> Bosmon: can you explain more?
2014-11-03T15:36:14 <Bosmon> If you wanted to encode it as a settings handler, there would be no alternative but to completely rebuild Gregg\'s instance of the GPII, whatever it happened to be
2014-11-03T15:36:32 <Bosmon> slim_jim - any executable can be specified as part of the process of launching a solution
2014-11-03T15:37:03 <slim_jim> Bosmon: ah so we call the screen .exe at same time. Eay peasy
2014-11-03T15:37:09 <slim_jim> *easy
2014-11-03T15:40:01 <jhernandez> slim_jim: here you can find a tutorial on how to use node-ffi -> https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi/wiki/Node-FFI-Tutorial
2014-11-03T15:40:06 <jhernandez> ;)
2014-11-03T15:40:16 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I pasted that same link 13 minutes ago
2014-11-03T15:40:18 <Bosmon> VANTTUNNEZ!
2014-11-03T15:40:23 <jhernandez> ohhh
2014-11-03T15:40:30 <Bosmon> Anyway I don\'t believe he has time to get that working in 1 day
2014-11-03T15:40:32 <slim_jim> hheeee
2014-11-03T15:40:41 <jhernandez> Bosmon: je suis desol\xc3\xa9!
2014-11-03T15:40:44 <Bosmon> It will be of lively academic interest
2014-11-03T15:41:02 * anvk joined the channel
2014-11-03T15:41:15 <slim_jim> Bosmon: you may be right - I intended to start earlier today
2014-11-03T15:41:18 <Bosmon> For when he comes to produce a solution that we will actually plan to use in the real production GPII, as opposed to a "toss-off engineering demonstration" : P
2014-11-03T15:41:34 <slim_jim> Bosmon: so talk me through how to add to the life cycle
2014-11-03T15:41:45 <slim_jim> I should ensure I have the file Gregg is using and add to it?
2014-11-03T15:41:47 <slim_jim> how?
2014-11-03T15:42:08 <Bosmon> slim_jim - you will add the solution to the win32.json file - actually the same one I just linked to
2014-11-03T15:42:29 <Bosmon> And then you can add a reference to this solution from some preference set
2014-11-03T15:42:38 <Bosmon> And then Gregg will log on using that preference set
2014-11-03T15:42:40 <slim_jim> Cool, I actually meant how to ensure I have the right version that Gregg is using.
2014-11-03T15:42:46 <slim_jim> I know I\'ll ask them for it :)
2014-11-03T15:43:13 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I can have no idea about that!
2014-11-03T15:43:24 <Bosmon> It depends on who was responsible for installing Gregg\'s machine the previous time
2014-11-03T15:43:38 <Bosmon> But any version of the GPII built in the last year should be capable of using this scheme
2014-11-03T15:43:42 <slim_jim> If we knew what *release* they had ;-P
