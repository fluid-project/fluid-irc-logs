2014-02-25T19:52:34 <clown> greggy1:  http://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/format-dl/#section_2
2014-02-25T19:54:02 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2014-02-25T19:54:18 <kasparnet> michelled: hmm... perhaps .. though I would\'ve thought it only use the preferences server
2014-02-25T19:54:30 <kasparnet> I guess it could be using the MM\'s as well
2014-02-25T19:54:49 <kasparnet> Justin_o: oh crap
2014-02-25T19:55:48 <kasparnet> I\'m not sure what the solution should be here
2014-02-25T19:56:04 <kasparnet> I mean, even the desired behavior is unclear to me
2014-02-25T19:56:34 <kasparnet> but the /login call should ALWAYS be to localhost as far as I can figure out
2014-02-25T19:56:46 <kasparnet> since it doesn\'t make any sense to make to a remote machine
2014-02-25T19:57:14 <kasparnet> the big quesiton is where the prefs should be fetched from
2014-02-25T19:57:29 <kasparnet> .. it seems natural to use a proxy on the localhost
2014-02-25T19:58:03 <kasparnet> but on the other hand, we want the PMT to be able to run online, and I dont think we require the GPII to be installed on the machine
2014-02-25T19:58:43 <kasparnet> (ofc we DO require it to support the "apply and save" functionality, but I guess we\'d need a "save" only option if it\'s running online ... all post pilots)
2014-02-25T19:59:19 <kasparnet> anyway, I\'m wondering if we\'re at the point where we should do hacks for this to work
2014-02-25T19:59:52 <kasparnet> michelled, Justin_o: ^
2014-02-25T20:00:05 <kasparnet> for the pilots, this would mean always expecting login/logout to happen on localhost
2014-02-25T20:00:09 <Justin_o> kasparnet: what hack did you have in mind.. and what\'s the deadline for it (which i guess was yesterday)
2014-02-25T20:00:18 <kasparnet> and preferences fetching always happening on remote prefs server
2014-02-25T20:00:42 <kasparnet> well - tomorrow evening we\'re gonna go through everything
2014-02-25T20:00:52 <kasparnet> so that\'s the definitive deadline
2014-02-25T20:01:11 <Justin_o> kasparnet: what time is that for us.. noonish?
2014-02-25T20:01:43 <kasparnet> Justin_o: yeah
2014-02-25T20:02:10 <kasparnet> Justin_o: well actually
2014-02-25T20:02:30 <kasparnet> I\'m gonna fly thursday morning - very early, and we\'re gonna go through things before you get up
2014-02-25T20:02:35 <kasparnet> on thursday
2014-02-25T20:02:48 <kasparnet> so theoretically stuff could make it in wednesday evening
2014-02-25T20:02:50 <kasparnet> your time
2014-02-25T20:03:26 <Justin_o> ah okay
2014-02-25T20:03:52 <colinclark> kasparnet: I don\'t think there\'s much of a hack that really needs to happen here
2014-02-25T20:04:04 <colinclark> it\'s my understand that the PMT isn\'t currently prepared to run on a remote web server
2014-02-25T20:04:21 <colinclark> it should be able to, and I really can\'t see any reason why it we won\'t want to do this in the future
2014-02-25T20:04:51 <colinclark> it will entail adding the PMT server to the list of accepted cross-origin requests for the Preferences Server, I believe
2014-02-25T20:05:12 <colinclark> But in the meantime, I was under the impression that no one has ever bothered to test the PMT anywhere but on the local device
2014-02-25T20:05:43 <colinclark> in which case it doesn\'t seem terribly hacky to imagine that in this configuration, the PMT would access the preferences server via the Flow Manager
2014-02-25T20:05:55 <colinclark> Am I missing something?
2014-02-25T20:06:02 <colinclark> seems like that\'s what you\'re saying, too
2014-02-25T20:06:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: the issue i\'m seeing right now is with login, saving seems to work with the remote preferences server
2014-02-25T20:06:25 <colinclark> Right
2014-02-25T20:06:34 <colinclark> the Preferences Server doesn\'t have any concept of logging in
2014-02-25T20:06:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: if there is a proxy so that PMT/PCP always goes to localhost, then nothing will have to change on this side
2014-02-25T20:07:02 <colinclark> A log in request can only sensibly be sent by the PMT/PCP to the local Flow Manager
2014-02-25T20:07:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep that\'s what i figure... but locally the urls all have the same structure
2014-02-25T20:07:09 <kasparnet> colinclark: what\'s more sketchy is that it seems the flowmanager currently (at least in the \'production\' mode) wont function as a proxy for the prefs server
2014-02-25T20:07:18 <colinclark> why not?
2014-02-25T20:07:47 <kasparnet> haven\'t figured that out yet, perhaps it\'s just me doing something wrong
2014-02-25T20:08:00 <kasparnet> but posting to localhost:8081/user/ gives an error
2014-02-25T20:08:08 <colinclark> interesting and lame
2014-02-25T20:08:12 <kasparnet> hahahahaha
2014-02-25T20:08:15 <kasparnet> indeed
2014-02-25T20:08:28 <colinclark> I just don\'t understand why on earth someone hasn\'t built a real freaking server for the PMT
2014-02-25T20:08:58 <colinclark> It would give us a significant amount of flexibility in these cases
2014-02-25T20:09:31 <colinclark> but I guess, aside from writing it in JSF, it\'s just out of reach for anyone but those of us having this conversation right now :)
2014-02-25T20:10:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: when you say PMT do you mean PMT/PCP or really just PMT
2014-02-25T20:10:45 <colinclark> Well, that\'s a good question, Justin_o
2014-02-25T20:10:56 <colinclark> They\'re separate things
2014-02-25T20:11:28 <colinclark> They both need to be structured so that they aren\'t just a pile of HTML running on someone random WAMP or node.js file system web server
2014-02-25T20:12:23 <colinclark> The PCP will be a "chromeless" web application
2014-02-25T20:12:25 <colinclark> using Node Webkit or some equivalent tool
2014-02-25T20:12:39 <colinclark> This will presumably provide it with expanded privileges, since it\'s only ever intended to run as a local application
2014-02-25T20:12:39 <colinclark> the PMT should really be a Kettle-based server
2014-02-25T20:13:03 <colinclark> And then we could easily write a handler than can make direct calls to the Preferences Server and do away with all of this kind of stuff
2014-02-25T20:13:13 <colinclark> including the ubiquitous CORS requirements we have
2014-02-25T20:13:19 <colinclark> If I\'m making any sense
2014-02-25T20:13:31 <colinclark> Crazy idea, which I\'m sure michelled will have some thoughts on
2014-02-25T20:13:43 <colinclark> but why don\'t we just write a little Kettle app for the PMT?
2014-02-25T20:13:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: PCP will also need to save, but i\'m guessing your saying as a chromeless app it will have less restrictions
2014-02-25T20:13:51 <colinclark> and then you can have all the stuff you want, like multiple configurations
2014-02-25T20:13:54 * cindyli has quit
2014-02-25T20:14:01 <colinclark> Justin_o: Yes, that\'s right
2014-02-25T20:14:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: so i\'m not sure we can do that by tomorrow evening though..
2014-02-25T20:14:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: also, any idea of chromeless apps are accessible?
2014-02-25T20:15:12 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-02-25T20:15:34 <colinclark> Presumably they inherit whatever accessibility characteristics their host rendering engine contains
2014-02-25T20:15:37 <colinclark> but I\'ve never tested it
2014-02-25T20:17:57 <colinclark> Justin_o: So it sounds like we need to focus on figuring out whether or not there\'s a bug with the Flow Manager when running in production mode
2014-02-25T20:18:11 <colinclark> in terms of it proxying to the Preferences Server?
2014-02-25T20:21:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: that makes sense
2014-02-25T20:21:10 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-25T20:21:11 <colinclark> who is doing that work?
2014-02-25T20:21:22 <colinclark> If we find we\'re stuck, I can probably whip up a Kettle app for us
2014-02-25T20:21:35 <colinclark> but I think you\'re probably right to say that it\'s not our best option with a day to go
2014-02-25T20:21:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: good question, hopefully someone who knows how the flow manager works :)
2014-02-25T20:21:53 <colinclark> kasparnet: are you looking at it?
2014-02-25T20:21:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, we\'re unfortunately pressed for time again
2014-02-25T20:22:06 <colinclark> :(
2014-02-25T20:22:21 <colinclark> no unit tests, no clear integration, no proper server
2014-02-25T20:22:25 <colinclark> That\'s risky
2014-02-25T20:22:38 <colinclark> I\'m sure we\'re all a little freaked out
2014-02-25T20:24:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: that about sums it up, but there\'s also a bunch of TODOs in the code if you want to get a bit more scared
2014-02-25T20:25:31 <kasparnet> colinclark: I can take a look tomorrow
2014-02-25T20:25:46 <colinclark> thanks kasparnet
2014-02-25T20:25:48 <kasparnet> colinclark: dont have much more juice in me today
2014-02-25T20:25:56 <colinclark> yes, no kidding
2014-02-25T20:29:27 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i have about another 30 minutes to my day, anything i can help you with till then?
2014-02-25T20:35:07 <Justin_o> kasparnet: by the way, this may have some bearing on what chris will need to do for http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-625
2014-02-25T20:55:43 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i wonder if the issue has to do with the lack of io.json in the production config for the flow manager configuration as well as some other changes that are in the dev grade supplied to the kettle app.
2014-02-25T21:03:50 <colinclark> Bosmon and kasparnet and jessm: So I posted this page to the wiki today: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Security_and_Privacy
2014-02-25T21:04:33 <jessm> colinclark: woah, heavy
2014-02-25T21:04:56 <Bosmon> Wow, thanks colinclark
2014-02-25T21:05:07 <colinclark> It was a Cloud4All deliverable, but I think it\'s helpful for thinking about our general approach to security
2014-02-25T21:07:19 <colinclark> and it is the only C4A deliverable I have made in Word instead of in the wiki first
2014-02-25T21:07:25 <colinclark> so I apologize for that
2014-02-25T21:08:29 <Bosmon> Well, it looks great
2014-02-25T21:08:45 <colinclark> I have heard from Marcel again
2014-02-25T21:08:50 <Bosmon> !
2014-02-25T21:08:55 <colinclark> so i will direct him to this as the only plan for secruity
2014-02-25T21:09:00 <colinclark> he can follow it or ignore
2014-02-25T21:09:01 <Bosmon> haven\'t?
2014-02-25T21:09:04 <colinclark> but we are pursuing it
2014-02-25T21:09:06 <colinclark> have
2014-02-25T21:09:40 <colinclark> He\'d like to integrate his security gate with "the rest of the architecture"
2014-02-25T21:09:47 <colinclark> but again, we\'re going to pursue this approach

2014-02-25T12:10:58 <kasparnet> @chrispetsos oops, sorry, didn't see your ping
2014-02-25T12:11:06 <kasparnet> so i just had a question about this pull request: https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/36/files
2014-02-25T12:11:12 <kasparnet> There is a merge conflict
2014-02-25T12:11:46 <kasparnet> http://pastie.org/8776937
2014-02-25T12:12:15 <kasparnet> I'm expecting that what we'd want after the merge is the lines 21-25 as they are in that pastie
2014-02-25T12:12:34 <kasparnet> (and hence deleting line 13-20 and line 26)
2014-02-25T12:12:40 <kasparnet> is that correct?
2014-02-25T12:12:44 <kasparnet> @chrispetsos ^
2014-02-25T12:13:42 <chrispetsos> @kasparnet i'm having a look at it right now
2014-02-25T12:13:58 <kasparnet> cool, thanks chrispetsos
2014-02-25T12:14:36 <chrispetsos> kasparnet you know what? i'm having difficulties reading this pastie, i'll update the pull request myself OK?
2014-02-25T12:18:06 <kasparnet> sure, thanks chrispetsos
2014-02-25T12:27:52 <chrispetsos> kasparnet it should be OK now. You should be able to merge it in automatically...
2014-02-25T12:28:04 <kasparnet> awesome! Thanks chrispetsos

2014-02-25T12:30:06 <kasparnet> or did this just happen when merging with master
2014-02-25T12:30:59 * jhernandez waves kasparnet and chrispetsos
2014-02-25T12:31:08 <kasparnet> hey jhernandez
2014-02-25T12:31:22 <chrispetsos> kasparnet no it's OK to remove those, PCP demo is now within prefsEditor demo
2014-02-25T12:31:32 <chrispetsos> hey jhernandez
2014-02-25T12:32:24 <kasparnet> chrispetsos: yeah - ok, checking the diff on my own machine, it looks like it's just github screwing it up
2014-02-25T12:32:28 <kasparnet> thanks

2014-02-25T13:46:29 <Justin_o> kasparnet: I'm trying to test our the remote preferences server with PMT but having no luck at the moment. I switched to using the production config by modifying this https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii.js#L22
2014-02-25T13:48:01 <Justin_o> kasparnet: but i get a 404 error on an OPTIONS request to http://localhost:8081/user/
2014-02-25T13:48:20 <Justin_o> kasparnet: any thoughts?
2014-02-25T13:49:44 <Justin_o> kasparnet: the production config for the flow manager doesn't include io.json. https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/production.json#L20-L22 Is this the problem?
2014-02-25T13:52:16 <Justin_o> kasparnet: just modified the above reference to include io.json. The only difference is that now i get a 404 error on a POST request to http://localhost:8081/user/

2014-02-25T13:59:40 <kasparnet> ... it seems it's attempting to get the preferences from the local preferences server
2014-02-25T14:01:25 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i had thought, although i don't really know how this works, that we always make calls locally from PMT/PCP and what that hits is a proxy for the actual prefs server being used

2014-02-25T16:49:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: did i hear that you got the checkboxes and radio buttons all fixed up for GPII-600?
2014-02-25T16:49:34 <cindyli> no, radio buttons are fixed but not checkboxes
2014-02-25T16:49:39 <cindyli> working on live regions
2014-02-25T16:49:49 <Justin_o> ah okay.. well that's getting closer at least :)
2014-02-25T16:49:54 <cindyli> ya
2014-02-25T16:50:00 <Justin_o> i guess the checkboxes are going to be harder if you have to start changing the panels around
2014-02-25T16:50:36 <cindyli> exactly, we may need to chat about that again

2014-02-25T17:20:21 <Justin_o> kasparnet: did you find out anything about connecting to the remote preferences server from PMT/PCP?
2014-02-25T17:37:18 <cindyli> Justin_o: have time to chat?
2014-02-25T17:37:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure

2014-02-25T18:36:42 <danaayotte_> sure cindyli
2014-02-25T18:36:44 <michelled> sure
2014-02-25T18:36:56 <cindyli> thanks, can we do it at my desk if you don't mind

2014-02-25T19:22:07 <Justin_o> michelled: i couldn't get the PMT/PCP working with the remove prefs server via configuration to universal. However I was able to get the PMT to save to the remote prefs server by changing GpiiSession.js to point at the remote prefs server instead of localhost. This worked to let me save a user, but PCP didn't seem to pick it up.

2014-02-25T19:35:53 <michelled> Justin_o: hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I wonder if there's something hardcoded in PCP
2014-02-25T19:37:37 <Justin_o> michelled: there is for web sockets, but i don't think we are really using those... could be mistaken though.
2014-02-25T19:38:05 <Justin_o> michelled: also, there isn't really a way to change between production and development for PCP/PMT like there is for the rest of the GPII
2014-02-25T19:38:48 * clown has quit
2014-02-25T19:39:46 <michelled> Justin_o: that sounds like an over sight
2014-02-25T19:40:05 <Justin_o> michelled: i mean there isn't a config file that we can just run them with
2014-02-25T19:40:13 <Justin_o> we don't have a kettle app for it for example
2014-02-25T19:41:58 <Justin_o> gpii.prefs.gpiiSession does take it as an option, but you would still have to have some way of knowing which environment you were running in to know what to change it to. PCP does have it hardcoded unfortunately for the web sockets :(
2014-02-25T19:44:38 <michelled> Justin_o: can you get it work by modifying that?
2014-02-25T19:44:50 <Justin_o> michelled: ah.. so the pcp wasn't picking it up because the token wasn't added to the URL, when loading the PCP
2014-02-25T19:45:34 <Justin_o> so it looks like it doesn't fully work in PMT, the user isn't being logged in locally, which may be because i'm not using configuration for the the remote prefs server for the rest of gpii
2014-02-25T19:45:38 <Justin_o> let me try to change both
2014-02-25T19:46:43 <kasparnet> Justin_o: sorry for leaving you hanging
2014-02-25T19:47:25 <Justin_o> kasparnet: no problem.. any info on the expected setup that should work with the remote prefs server?
2014-02-25T19:48:19 <kasparnet> nope - I expected the production mode to work, but at least it doesn't seem to work with the PCP and PMT
2014-02-25T19:48:25 <kasparnet> as you have also confirmed
2014-02-25T19:48:39 <kasparnet> it seems the flowmanager doesn't pick up that URI at all
2014-02-25T19:49:47 <kasparnet> Justin_o: and even trying to run the system normally in production mode doesn't seem to be properly working
2014-02-25T19:50:00 <Justin_o> kasparnet: :(
2014-02-25T19:50:39 <michelled> kasparnet: avtar hasn't redeployed masters yet
2014-02-25T19:50:43 <michelled> could that be the issue?
2014-02-25T19:50:56 <michelled> the prefs server is running master, but the other things are review 2 branch
2014-02-25T19:50:57 <Justin_o> kasparnet: in terms of PMT/PCP it looks like the login fails. So if i modify PMT to use preferences.gpii.net as the base url it tries to login via a GET request to http://preferences.gpii.net/user/<token>/login which returns a 404
