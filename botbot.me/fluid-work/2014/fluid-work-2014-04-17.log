2014-04-17T15:54:07 <jhernand1z> I trust you
2014-04-17T15:54:10 <jhernand1z> :P
2014-04-17T15:54:20 <clown> F20 is bullet proof!
2014-04-17T15:54:26 <clown> unless you turn on the magnifier...
2014-04-17T15:54:31 <jhernand1z> haha
2014-04-17T15:54:58 <jhernand1z> and rawhide eats babys
2014-04-17T15:54:59 <jhernand1z> xDDD
2014-04-17T15:55:04 <clown> jhernand1z:  is there more to your stack trace that just "(process:4259): PackageKit-CRITICAL **: pk_results_get_package_sack: assertion \'PK_IS_RESULTS (results)\' failed"
2014-04-17T15:55:27 <jhernand1z> nope
2014-04-17T15:55:33 <clown> although I\'m not an expert and diagnosing GObject stack traces\xe2\x80\xa6  ah okay.
2014-04-17T15:55:59 <jhernand1z> to get more info I should use gdb
2014-04-17T15:56:12 <jhernand1z> which is a pita
2014-04-17T15:56:13 <clown> happy, happy, joy, joy.
2014-04-17T15:56:27 <clown> gdb is middle eastern bread?
2014-04-17T15:56:32 <jhernand1z> you have to build node with --with-gdb (or the like)
2014-04-17T15:56:34 <clown> sorry...
2014-04-17T15:56:44 <jhernand1z> hehe
2014-04-17T15:57:55 <jhernand1z> but I\'m sure it\'s a matter of openSUSE
2014-04-17T15:58:07 <jhernand1z> well, oS\'s packageKit
2014-04-17T15:58:26 <clown> hey, here\'s your chance to file a patch with packagekit!
2014-04-17T15:58:42 * clown always trying to be the optimist \xe2\x80\xa6. not.
2014-04-17T15:58:52 <jhernand1z> maybe it\'s something downstream
2014-04-17T15:58:56 <jhernand1z> not upstream
2014-04-17T15:59:04 <jhernand1z> since it works on Fedora
2014-04-17T15:59:27 <clown> yes, all packagekit is is a wrapper around the "native" package manager (= yum on Fedora)
2014-04-17T15:59:37 <clown> hmm.   that\'s not a smiley.
2014-04-17T15:59:48 <clown> = yum on Fedora
2014-04-17T15:59:52 <jhernand1z> yes, oS uses zypper
2014-04-17T16:00:29 <jhernand1z> anyhooo ...
2014-04-17T16:00:31 <jhernand1z> gotta leave
2014-04-17T16:00:49 <clown> cool.  thanks again for helping.
2014-04-17T16:00:57 <jhernand1z> thanks to you
2014-04-17T16:01:21 <clown> I will look more closely at the code to see how you pulled this off, and try to understand node/kettle/kettle apps better.
2014-04-17T16:01:33 <jhernand1z> will try to dump my thoughts regarding our next steps here
2014-04-17T16:01:58 <clown> But, tomorrow is a holiday, so nothing tomorrow (likely).
2014-04-17T16:01:59 <jhernand1z> but the plan is just keep scaffolding
2014-04-17T16:02:05 <clown> and nothing until Mon, then.
2014-04-17T16:02:09 <jhernand1z> yeah
2014-04-17T16:02:18 <jhernand1z> well, tTue
2014-04-17T16:02:20 <clown> and move the scaffold to something official piece-by-piece.
2014-04-17T16:02:28 <michelled> cindyli, jhung: who is going to give me a pull request for the metadata demo?
2014-04-17T16:02:38 <jhernand1z> it\'s holiday here in Belgium
2014-04-17T16:02:49 <jhernand1z> (Monday)
2014-04-17T16:02:49 <clown> c\'est bon pour vous.

2014-04-17T16:03:02 <jhernand1z> :)
2014-04-17T16:03:11 <clown> et votre chiens.
2014-04-17T16:03:16 <michelled> jhung: can I get a pull request today for it?
2014-04-17T16:03:30 <jhernand1z> xDDD
2014-04-17T16:03:33 <michelled> because if there\'s anything that cindy needs to change it has to happen
2014-04-17T16:03:36 <cindyli> yes, jhung, and Tuesday
2014-04-17T16:03:39 <jhung> yes michelled - this afternoon. Earlier hopefully.
2014-04-17T16:03:41 <michelled> and there are a chain of things that must be done after that
2014-04-17T16:03:49 <clown> jhernand1z:  avoid the parks with your dogs, they might accidentally try to eat some eggs.
2014-04-17T16:03:59 <jhung> cindyli: in that case I\'ll send the pull request so i can quickly do modifications monday if needed.
2014-04-17T16:04:01 <jhernand1z> yes, maybe we\'ll escape to Gent, but still not sure
2014-04-17T16:04:10 <clown> "accidently"  \xe2\x80\x94 they must on purpose try to eat some egs.
2014-04-17T16:04:15 <clown> or eggs even.
2014-04-17T16:04:17 <jhung> ok michelled.
2014-04-17T16:04:18 <cindyli> that would be great, jhung, thanks
2014-04-17T16:04:18 <jhernand1z> clown: heh, they love chocolate
2014-04-17T16:04:24 <clown> that\'s bad for them.
2014-04-17T16:04:29 <jhernand1z> yes
2014-04-17T16:04:33 <clown> probably tastes good going in...
2014-04-17T16:04:45 <clown> "Gent"?
2014-04-17T16:05:09 <clown> oh, shall I blow away the etherpad, jhernand1z?  You don\'t need that anymore, right?
2014-04-17T16:05:09 <cindyli> jhung, anastasiac, jon\'s pull request for the safari fix with the overview panel was just merged into the master

2014-04-17T16:06:52 <jhernand1z> see you on Tuesday
2014-04-17T16:06:53 <jhung> cindyli: I just pushed up changes to the repo. I think it fixes the remaining styling issues. I guess this just leaves any Aria markup to be added if needed.
2014-04-17T16:06:58 <clown> bye!
2014-04-17T16:07:06 <jhernand1z> and bon weekend!

2014-04-17T16:07:59 <cindyli> cool. thanks. I will be going thru the demo and find out what aria attributes need to be added, jhung.

2014-04-17T17:32:47 <jhung> michelled: yep.
2014-04-17T17:33:01 <anastasiac> jhung, michelled, I\'m currently drafting a \'news\' page for the floe site
2014-04-17T17:33:07 <anastasiac> help with some text would be great
2014-04-17T17:33:17 <anastasiac> my brain isn\'t working well for writing write now
2014-04-17T17:33:40 <anastasiac> jhung, any ideas for text content for a \'news\' item about the pcp/pmt?
2014-04-17T17:33:44 <michelled> danaayotte_: is that something you could lend a hand with?
2014-04-17T17:34:52 <anastasiac> I guess something similar to the intro part of the video? "Floe is partnering with the GPII to create prefs editors. This video describes them\xe2\x80\xa6" Something like that?
2014-04-17T17:50:39 <anastasiac> michelled, in the screencast transcript, there\'s no problem with "GPII" is there? It\'s only "PMT"?
2014-04-17T17:51:33 <michelled> better get rid of that too
2014-04-17T17:54:22 <danaayotte_> anastasiac: is it just a kind of headline you need, or a short article, or?
2014-04-17T17:55:01 <anastasiac> danaayotte_, something to add to this page: http://www.floeproject.org/news/
2014-04-17T17:55:08 <anastasiac> so something like it
2014-04-17T17:55:27 <anastasiac> danaayotte_, a headline, a short paragraph, and the video
2014-04-17T17:56:17 <anastasiac> danaayotte_, right now, all I seem to be able to come up with is "The Floe Project is collaborating with the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure to create Preference Editing tools. These tools allows learners to declare and store their individual needs and preferences for a variety of devices. The video below provides more information. " which seems skimpy to me :-)
2014-04-17T17:56:41 <danaayotte_> ok.  that sounds like a good start.  let me see what i can do to flesh it out

2014-04-17T18:32:40 <danaayotte_> The Floe Project is collaborating with the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure to build tools to allow users to create personalized digital interfaces. These preference management tools enable and promote the discovery, adjustment and application of user preferences across multiple devices.  A user will be able to customize any interface they might encounter by exploring and then declaring preferences, saving them to the cloud, a
2014-04-17T18:32:41 <danaayotte_> applying them to devices (both private and public). For example, a user may use these tools to discover and adjust their preferences on a personal laptop, and later apply these preferences to a public ticketing kiosk.
2014-04-17T18:32:42 <danaayotte_> Personalized interfaces have the potential to help digital users overcome barriers to access and participation in an increasingly digital world. Interfaces that meet users where they are, adapt to their unique needs, and empower them to participate by putting the personalization decisions in their hands are not only possible, but are a necessity for many to \xe2\x80\x9cget in the digital door.\xe2\x80\x9d The goal of this personalization is to make

2014-04-17T15:09:35 <jhernandez> sweet
2014-04-17T15:09:39 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-17T15:09:46 <clown> a lot of things.
2014-04-17T15:10:42 <clown> looks done.
2014-04-17T15:11:11 <jhernandez> ok
2014-04-17T15:11:17 <clown> I don\'t see any errors .
2014-04-17T15:11:50 <clown> trying the "NODE_ENV" incantation again
2014-04-17T15:11:51 <jhernandez> just as sanity check, `find node_modules -name infusion` again
2014-04-17T15:11:59 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-04-17T15:12:01 <clown> okay.  I\'ll do that first.
2014-04-17T15:12:32 <clown> still just the one copy in universal...
2014-04-17T15:13:51 <clown> More errors.  https://etherpad.mozilla.org/MmarWPvFsS
2014-04-17T15:16:23 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-04-17T15:16:50 <clown> actually, I was wrong about the result of the find infusion.
2014-04-17T15:16:57 * jhernandez grabs the right laptop to actually try it
2014-04-17T15:17:02 <jhernandez> clown: heh
2014-04-17T15:17:04 <jhernandez> xD
2014-04-17T15:17:10 <clown> there are two copies, one in universal, and one under linuxDeviceReporter
2014-04-17T15:17:29 * clown is dumb.  didn\'t run the find in the correct directory.
2014-04-17T15:17:29 <jhernandez> ah
2014-04-17T15:17:47 <jhernandez> xD
2014-04-17T15:17:51 <clown> aka:  ./linux/node_modules/linuxDeviceReporter/node_modules/infusion
2014-04-17T15:17:58 <clown> and
2014-04-17T15:18:10 <clown> ./node_modules/universal/node_modules/infusion
2014-04-17T15:18:32 <jhernandez> but
2014-04-17T15:18:36 * clown wonders if that matters...
2014-04-17T15:18:42 <cindyli> jhung: michelled, in terms of issue #3 on jhung\'s list that the metadata demo doesn\'t work in IE8 and IE9,
2014-04-17T15:18:44 <jhernandez> you should be under linux/node_modules/linuxDeviceReporter all the time
2014-04-17T15:18:56 <clown> yes.
2014-04-17T15:18:59 <jhernandez> even when you run npm install
2014-04-17T15:19:30 <clown> I was for the npm install 15? minutes ago.
2014-04-17T15:19:36 <cindyli> this is \'cuz pounchDB library doesn\'t support those browsers, according to http://pouchdb.com/learn.html, "PouchDB is experimental on Internet Explorer 10+, Opera and various mobile browsers and environments" & "PouchDB requires an ES5 environment, if your browser does not support this (IE < 9, Android < 4.0, Opera Mini) you will need to include the https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim library."
2014-04-17T15:19:47 <cindyli> jhung and michelled: ^
2014-04-17T15:20:22 <cindyli> i\'ve tried to add in shim library but no luck, somewhere still went wrong with pouchDB. I wonder if it\'s ok to drop IE8 & 9 support for now?
2014-04-17T15:21:16 <jhung> cindyli: I\'m okay with that. Perhaps respond to the email on list? I will go and verify on latest IE now...
2014-04-17T15:21:32 <cindyli> ok, jhung
2014-04-17T15:25:12 <jhung> cindyli: it works fine in IE11 latest. However, the panel doesn\'t remain closed when moving from landing page to resource editor. A minor bug that affects IE only.
2014-04-17T15:25:35 <cindyli> ok, jhung, i will look into that later
2014-04-17T15:25:36 * jhernand1z joined the channel
2014-04-17T15:25:46 <jhung> No worries cindyli.
2014-04-17T15:25:57 <cindyli> ah ok, jhung
2014-04-17T15:26:06 <clown> jhernand1z has a twin :-)
2014-04-17T15:26:11 <jhernand1z> clown: just npm install-ed again here and it works
2014-04-17T15:26:21 <jhernandez> evil twins :P
2014-04-17T15:26:59 <jhernand1z> here npm grabs two copies of infusion
2014-04-17T15:27:06 <clown> and it installed infusion in "node_modules" under linuxDeviceReporter?
2014-04-17T15:27:27 <jhernand1z> linuxDeviceReporter> find . -name infusion
2014-04-17T15:27:27 <jhernand1z> ./node_modules/kettle/node_modules/infusion
2014-04-17T15:27:28 <jhernand1z> ./node_modules/infusion
2014-04-17T15:27:31 <jhernand1z> yea
2014-04-17T15:27:44 <jhernand1z> deleted ./node_modules/kettle/node_modules/infusion
2014-04-17T15:28:38 <clown> I am only seeing one copy below linuxDeviceReporter:  ./node_modules/infusion.
2014-04-17T15:28:54 * clown has nothing to delete
2014-04-17T15:28:57 <jhernand1z> mm
2014-04-17T15:29:08 <jhernand1z> strange

2014-04-17T15:31:14 <clown> if that matters...
2014-04-17T15:32:14 <jhernand1z> they should be there
2014-04-17T15:32:35 <clown> well, they are.  so, yay!
2014-04-17T15:32:37 <jhernand1z> clown: re-paste the last error plz
2014-04-17T15:32:45 <anastasiac> cindyli, will you be joining stand-up?

2014-04-17T15:42:09 <jhernand1z> sorry
2014-04-17T15:42:37 <clown> harumph!  that change in package.json (0.1 -> 0.1.0) won\'t let me pull \xe2\x80\x94 "you have unstaged changes".  Getting rid of it.
2014-04-17T15:42:52 <jhernand1z> git checkout .
2014-04-17T15:43:11 <clown> yah, already did that; and pulled.
2014-04-17T15:43:18 * michelled has quit
2014-04-17T15:43:26 <clown> do I need to "./build.sh"?

2014-04-17T15:44:08 <clown> do I need to npm install?

2014-04-17T15:45:00 <clown> This is a good sign.
2014-04-17T15:45:47 <jhernand1z> yeah
2014-04-17T15:46:05 <jhernand1z> now in another console you have to run a solutionsRegistry
2014-04-17T15:46:17 <clown> on a lark, i opened up FF and loaded "http://localhost:8888/device"
2014-04-17T15:46:35 <clown> I got "{"isError":true,"message":"connect ECONNREFUSED"}".  Not too surprising.
2014-04-17T15:46:37 <jhernand1z> otherwise, you\'ll get an error when trying to load http://localhost:8888/device
2014-04-17T15:46:40 <jhernand1z> :)
2014-04-17T15:46:49 <clown> I\'m just toooo fast....
2014-04-17T15:47:33 <jhernand1z> too fast too furious

2014-04-17T12:40:42 <jhung> let me know when you have received it and maybe we can quickly chat about it. The PouchDB error in IE may be the most critical?

2014-04-17T13:26:53 <cindyli> in terms of the browser support, do we still need to support IE 8 and even 9

2014-04-17T14:03:31 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, I saw your email. Testing...
2014-04-17T14:04:13 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, same thing there. Seems pretty major, to mee
2014-04-17T14:04:35 <anastasiac> not happening in chrome, interestingly
2014-04-17T14:04:52 <jhung> anastasiac: yes I noticed that too.
2014-04-17T14:04:59 <anastasiac> <sigh>
2014-04-17T14:05:20 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ll email you the fix and you can see if it works well. It worked for me but it\'ll be good to have another person to verify
2014-04-17T14:05:30 <anastasiac> sounds good, jhung

2014-04-17T14:11:06 <anastasiac> well done!
2014-04-17T14:11:27 <jhung> thanks anastasiac. Is overviewPanel in master? If it is, I guess we\'ll need to make a jira and pull request
2014-04-17T14:12:18 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, michelled merged it yesterday
2014-04-17T14:12:46 <jhung> ok. I\'ll do that now anastasiac

2014-04-17T14:18:04 <cindyli> keep in mind that the provided video needs to have a suffix for the demo to figure out the video type
2014-04-17T14:18:23 <cindyli> so a random video link from youtube that ends with a hash code would not work
2014-04-17T14:18:54 <jhung> cindyli: I was trying with .ogv and .mp4 links and it wasn\'t working.
2014-04-17T14:19:06 <jhung> I even used the video from the predefined OER and it didn\'t work.
2014-04-17T14:19:45 <cindyli> which browser did you use with mp4? firefox doesn\'t support mp4 but chrome, safari do, jhung
2014-04-17T14:19:53 <cindyli> can you give me ur video link
2014-04-17T14:20:42 <clown> jhernandez, I\'m having trouble running your latest DR code.  Got time for some advice (after the gnome a11y meeting)?
2014-04-17T14:21:02 <jhung> cindyli: nevermind. While I was copying the URLs, the video started to play. It just took a long time to load.
2014-04-17T14:21:10 <jhung> I was using these URLs: https://archive.org/download/gov.ntis.ava11754vnb1/ava11754vnb1.ogv

2014-04-17T14:21:56 <jhung> I guess we should put the "If the video doesn\'t play" warning back into the preview cindyli? We had it in the previous demo.
2014-04-17T14:22:23 <cindyli> yes, i will put that in
2014-04-17T14:22:40 <jhung> great thanks cindyli
2014-04-17T14:22:46 <cindyli> np
2014-04-17T14:23:19 <jhung> cindyli: let me know when that gets pushed. I\'ll probably want to add some styling and tweak the wording.
2014-04-17T14:23:37 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2014-04-17T14:26:54 <cindyli> jhung: added and pushed. see in "resource.html" line 119-126
2014-04-17T14:28:29 <jhung> thanks cindyli
2014-04-17T14:28:34 <cindyli> np
2014-04-17T14:30:05 <jhung> anastasiac: I submitted a pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/492
2014-04-17T14:30:38 <anastasiac> jhung, great, thanks
2014-04-17T14:43:01 <clown> jhernandez:  first question.
2014-04-17T14:43:07 <clown> this line:  NODE_ENV=myConfig node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js configs/
2014-04-17T14:43:21 <clown> what does \'myConfig\' mean?
2014-04-17T14:44:00 <jhernandez> the config we want to use within our module
2014-04-17T14:44:18 <jhernandez> it\'s defined under configs
2014-04-17T14:44:18 <clown> and that is?
2014-04-17T14:44:30 <clown> ah,
2014-04-17T14:44:42 <jhernandez> http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/GPII_Services_Configuration
2014-04-17T14:44:56 <clown> then, what directory should I be in?  There are a lot of configs/ in various places...
2014-04-17T14:45:05 * clown looks.
2014-04-17T14:45:12 * colinclark has quit
2014-04-17T14:45:53 <clown> I *think* it\'s .../universal/
2014-04-17T14:46:02 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-04-17T14:46:47 <jhernandez> clown: you should be under linux/node_modules/linuxDeviceReporter
2014-04-17T14:47:10 <jhernandez> aaand
2014-04-17T14:47:14 <clown> okay.  then I thought wrong\xe2\x80\xa6  :-)
2014-04-17T14:47:16 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-04-17T14:48:05 <jhernandez> clown: this is how gpii components are developed
2014-04-17T14:48:08 <clown> "aaand"  ?
2014-04-17T14:48:49 <jhernandez> and by using the NODE_ENV variable we can tell them to be deployed in different ways
2014-04-17T14:50:07 <clown> okay.  just to check, my NODE_ENV has no value at the start.  Should it?
2014-04-17T14:51:01 <jhernandez> in this case you should use NODE_ENV=myConfig
2014-04-17T14:51:10 <jhernandez> so it shouldn\'t
2014-04-17T14:51:15 <clown> good.
2014-04-17T14:51:49 <clown> Okay, I\'ve read (skimmed) that wiki link.  I don\'t see "myConfig" anywhere.  So, bear with me, what is "myConfig"?
2014-04-17T14:51:54 <clown> A variable?
2014-04-17T14:52:10 <clown> a command?
2014-04-17T14:53:00 <clown> because, when is type (literally):  NODE_ENV=myConfig node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js configs/
2014-04-17T14:53:03 <clown> I get an error.
2014-04-17T14:53:04 <jhernandez> myConfig is a configuration living under linux/node_modules/linuxDeviceReporter
2014-04-17T14:53:21 <clown> so it\'s a file.
2014-04-17T14:53:23 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-04-17T14:53:46 <jhernandez> that\'s the reason you should be under linux/node_modules/linuxDeviceReporter folder in order to start the module
2014-04-17T14:54:15 <clown> and is should type that line at bash, and it should work, provided I\'m in that directory?
2014-04-17T14:54:28 <clown> *and I should type...
2014-04-17T14:54:35 * michelled joined the channel
2014-04-17T14:54:49 <clown> it doesn\'t.
2014-04-17T14:55:02 * clown making a paste bin.
2014-04-17T14:55:04 <jhernandez> please
2014-04-17T14:57:57 <clown> jhernandez:  made an ether pad instead:  https://etherpad.mozilla.org/MmarWPvFsS
2014-04-17T14:58:35 <clown> it\'s looking for kettle in the wrong place.
2014-04-17T14:59:26 * jhernandez looks
2014-04-17T14:59:47 <jhernandez> clown: did you run \'npm install\'?
2014-04-17T14:59:59 <clown> yes.
2014-04-17T15:00:07 <clown> but, let me do that again.
2014-04-17T15:00:19 <jhernandez> mmm
2014-04-17T15:00:29 <jhernandez> maybe duped infusion?
2014-04-17T15:00:52 <jhernandez> find node_modules -name infusion
2014-04-17T15:01:13 <clown> just to be sure, does it matter what directory I\'m in when I run "npm install"?  And I should probably do the "delete all files before running npm install" trick.
2014-04-17T15:01:27 * clown running that find command.
2014-04-17T15:02:40 <jhernandez> you should run under linux/node_modules/linuxDeviceReporter
2014-04-17T15:02:44 <clown> just one infusion at "node_modules/universal/node_modules/infusion"
2014-04-17T15:02:58 <clown> no infusion under linux.
