b'2014-03-31T18:27:08 <anastasiac> I think the case could be argued for either option, and if we make the default what we\'ll use in our demos, that would make our demos a wee bit simpler
2014-03-31T18:27:17 <colinclark> I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a page on the Fluid wiki with everything you need
2014-03-31T18:27:19 <colinclark> let me have a look
2014-03-31T18:27:45 <colinclark> Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re still using the 3.0 version of CC
2014-03-31T18:27:48 <colinclark> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
2014-03-31T18:28:18 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m feeling the same way. But I wonder if we should change the name of the component if we start making it specific to demos?
2014-03-31T18:28:55 <colinclark> michelled: I believe this is the text-only version of it http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode
2014-03-31T18:29:13 <michelled> thx colinclark
2014-03-31T18:29:46 <anastasiac> jhung, I don\'t think we need to go that far. It is generic enough that it could easily be used for things other than demos, and by naming it \'overview panel\' it helps us to convey that idea
2014-03-31T18:31:09 <Justin_o> karan10_: it could be that we disabled it from tinyMCE but i can\'t remember off hand
2014-03-31T18:31:23 <jhung> anastasiac: so would you +1 "Open/close demo instructions" to be the default label for the toggle?
2014-03-31T18:31:45 <jhung> I would support that decision.
2014-03-31T18:32:55 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, I\'m good with that
2014-03-31T18:33:16 <jhung> simonjb: does that work for you?
2014-03-31T18:33:27 <simonjb> works for me, I will implement "Open demo instructions" and "Close demo instructions"
2014-03-31T18:34:01 <jhung> Cool thanks!
2014-03-31T18:34:23 <michelled> simonjb, anastasiac, colinclark: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs
2014-03-31T18:34:29 <simonjb> Justin_o: we were thinking that for the toggle control we would change the label dynamically based on current state
2014-03-31T18:34:59 <simonjb> Justin_o: if the panel is open the label for toggle would say "close..." and if the panel is closed it would say "open..."
2014-03-31T18:35:19 <simonjb> Justin_o: any concern with dynamically changing an aria-label?
2014-03-31T18:35:23 <Justin_o> simonjb: that makes sense
2014-03-31T18:35:42 <simonjb> thanks michelled
2014-03-31T18:35:49 <michelled> np
2014-03-31T18:36:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: i think that should be okay to change the aria dynamically
2014-03-31T18:37:06 <Justin_o> we\'ll need to do some tests to be sure though
2014-03-31T18:37:32 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks, I will implement it and test and also check with clown_mtg
2014-03-31T18:38:33 <danaayotte> simonjb, jhung, anastasiac: I\'m thinking it could just say "close" when the panel is open as I don\'t think it\'s necessary to have the full description once the panel is already open
2014-03-31T18:38:46 <danaayotte> for simplicity
2014-03-31T18:39:49 <jhung> danaayotte: to clarify we\'re talking about the aria mark-up which isn\'t visible. It\'s for ATs to read back.
2014-03-31T18:41:55 <danaayotte> thanks jhung! simonjb was just explaining same.
2014-03-31T18:42:37 <jhung> Cool. :)
2014-03-31T18:43:34 <karan10_> Justin_o: ok :)

2014-03-31T14:10:46 <colinclark> hey simonjb, michelled mentioned a documentation tool you were telling her about
2014-03-31T14:10:50 <colinclark> what\xe2\x80\x99s it called?
2014-03-31T14:11:54 <simonjb> colinclark: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
2014-03-31T14:12:55 <colinclark> The mention of markdown extensions is an interesting one
2014-03-31T14:13:21 <colinclark> My increasing impression is that \xe2\x80\x9cstandard markdown,\xe2\x80\x9d if there even is such a thing, is pretty insufficient in itself
2014-03-31T14:13:43 <colinclark> and so I guess most tools that use markdown end up settling on some set of extensions to it
2014-03-31T14:15:41 <simonjb> markdown is pretty minimal and originally targeted at making it easier to write a subset of HTML
2014-03-31T14:15:43 <simonjb> https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
2014-03-31T14:16:11 <simonjb> with the intention that anything not provided in markdown would be written in HTML directly
2014-03-31T14:17:03 <simonjb> but many people have now written alternative markdown processors with various extensions
2014-03-31T14:17:25 <simonjb> pandoc is taking markdown in the direction of latex like semantics
2014-03-31T14:17:42 <simonjb> enough say to write a book in
2014-03-31T14:18:38 <simonjb> michelled ^
2014-03-31T14:21:45 * karan10 has quit
2014-03-31T14:23:03 <michelled> hmmm, the epub3 integration could be interesting for Floe
2014-03-31T14:27:28 <simonjb> http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try/
2014-03-31T14:41:46 <colinclark> simonjb: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it, at some point, raise the question why one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just use LaTeX insetad?
2014-03-31T14:42:44 <colinclark> I mean, in some ways, these things are deeply at odds with each other...
2014-03-31T14:42:55 <colinclark> I use Markdown a lot for quick writing
2014-03-31T14:43:20 <colinclark> and the value of it is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a very limited syntax that I can carry in my head and use quickly
2014-03-31T14:43:49 <colinclark> whereas, just starting to use LaTeX for my papers recently, it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly on the very other side of the spectrum in terms of very rich semantics
2014-03-31T14:43:57 <colinclark> at the cost of markup complexity and \xe2\x80\x9csurface area\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-03-31T14:44:28 <colinclark> My use of Markdown so far suggests that it\xe2\x80\x99s barely even adequate for making web sites
2014-03-31T14:45:00 <colinclark> just for making simple \xe2\x80\x9cpages\xe2\x80\x9d without, say, anchors or other more complex structural elements
2014-03-31T14:46:25 <simonjb> colinclark: I think it depends really on what our needs are; there are many different documentation markup notations and processors
2014-03-31T14:47:14 <simonjb> latex is great for making articles and books for paper
2014-03-31T14:47:30 <colinclark> yup
2014-03-31T14:47:43 <simonjb> but, while there are latex to HTML converters, writing for the web isn\'t its strength
2014-03-31T14:49:13 <simonjb> so, it terms of selecting doc tooling, I think we need to figure out what are needs are for the generated documentation
2014-03-31T14:49:30 <colinclark> yes, i can definitely see that
2014-03-31T14:49:52 <colinclark> i guess the point I\xe2\x80\x99m fuzzily trying to make is that \xe2\x80\x9cmarkdown\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t really much of a thing
2014-03-31T14:50:10 <colinclark> and what people mean when they say their site generator supports markdown is that it supports MD + some arbitrary extensions
2014-03-31T14:50:24 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s correct, it\xe2\x80\x99s just an impression
2014-03-31T14:50:38 <simonjb> I think that you are right
2014-03-31T14:50:57 <colinclark> As a side note, I find learning LaTeX really intriguing
2014-03-31T14:52:16 <colinclark> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read anything about it\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s that typical \xe2\x80\x9cimmersion by necessity\xe2\x80\x9d process
2014-03-31T14:52:20 * karan10 joined the channel
2014-03-31T14:52:34 <colinclark> but I get the sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting
2014-03-31T14:53:13 <colinclark> Going back to the original point, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s one of these interesting things related to criteria for a site generator
2014-03-31T14:53:27 <simonjb> the creator of latex recently won the ACM Turing Award (not specifically for latex)
2014-03-31T14:53:51 <colinclark> Leslie Lamport?
2014-03-31T14:54:03 <simonjb> http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/03/17/microsoft-s-leslie-lamport-wins-the-turing-award-the-nobel-prize-in-computing.aspx
2014-03-31T14:54:21 <simonjb> week before last
2014-03-31T14:54:22 <colinclark> Microsoft Research really is stacked with these guys
2014-03-31T14:54:27 <colinclark> incredible computer science innovators
2014-03-31T14:54:41 <colinclark> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how easy it is to add a particular markdown extension to an arbitrary static generator, for example
2014-03-31T14:55:21 <simonjb> it would depend on the generator and how pluggable/extensible it was
2014-03-31T14:55:30 <colinclark> It seems unlikely that we\xe2\x80\x99ll know, for all our potential sites, exactly what sorts of HTML we\xe2\x80\x99ll need a priori
2014-03-31T14:55:39 <colinclark> right, yes
2014-03-31T14:55:52 <colinclark> so Justin_o this feeds in to the \xe2\x80\x9cextensibility\xe2\x80\x9d criteria that we talked about

2014-03-31T14:59:21 <colinclark> I guess some of the more fuzzy issues surface when you look at some feature that Markdown partially supports
2014-03-31T14:59:33 <colinclark> like, for example, you can define headers in Markdown very easily
2014-03-31T14:59:41 <colinclark> but, I think, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support defining anchors for an element
2014-03-31T14:59:53 <colinclark> so the \xe2\x80\x9cfall back to HTML\xe2\x80\x9d becomes somewhat more awkward in that case
2014-03-31T15:00:00 <colinclark> I imagine, anyway
2014-03-31T15:00:09 <colinclark> as I say, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get my head around it all
2014-03-31T15:01:23 <colinclark> actually, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong
2014-03-31T15:01:37 <colinclark> but I guess there are other examples of this kind of situation
2014-03-31T15:02:40 <michelled> Justin_o, simonjb, anastasiac, danaayotte: shall we have our floe planning meeting?
2014-03-31T15:02:41 <simonjb> definitely and I think the original plan was that the MD -> HTML conversion would be understood
2014-03-31T15:02:56 <Justin_o> michelled: sure
2014-03-31T15:03:13 <simonjb> that is MD: is not an abstraction on top of HTML
2014-03-31T15:03:26 <Justin_o> jhung: see michelled\'s message above
2014-03-31T15:03:41 <simonjb> so when you have to use HTML, it\'s not a \'leakage\'
2014-03-31T15:03:56 <simonjb> but an intended part of the design

2014-03-31T17:49:58 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure how well it will work for our code base, but could be useful. It\'s free for open source
2014-03-31T17:50:16 <Justin_o> it also has github integration to analyze pull requests automatically

2014-03-31T17:57:35 <jhung1> anastasiac: simonjb and I were discussing what would be the default text for the label for the hide/show toggle for the OverviewPanel component.
2014-03-31T17:58:11 <anastasiac> hm. What have you come up with so far, jhung1 and simonjb?
2014-03-31T17:59:20 <jhung1> simonjb and I were thinking that the label would be "Open / Close Overview Panel" and the label would be customizable. However, in our integrations we would probably use "Open / Close Demo Instructions". So my question is, should this be the default rather than "Open/Close Overview Panel"?

2014-03-31T18:18:00 <karan10_> I was just getting familiar with the available infusion products. I noticed that in "Rich Text Inline Edit" while editing with Tiny MCE we can\'t change the syle of text. Styles drop down list doesn\'t appear on clicking.

2014-03-31T18:25:25 <anastasiac> my first thought was that we should use "overview panel" as the default, since that\'s what it is
2014-03-31T18:25:40 <anastasiac> but we really did design this with demos in mind
2014-03-31T18:25:59 <anastasiac> so it could easily be argued that demos are, in fact, the default, but it can be customized for other purposes
