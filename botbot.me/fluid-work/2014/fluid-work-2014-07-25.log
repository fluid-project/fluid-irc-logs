2014-07-25T13:31:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have any thoughts on this issue that i brought up on list http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2014-July/002547.html
2014-07-25T13:34:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - have you tried using the standard framework utility for this purpose : P
2014-07-25T13:34:15 <Bosmon> I sent a few mails recommending it a few months back
2014-07-25T13:34:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: unfortunately I\'m not sure what you are referring to, so I\'m not sure.
2014-07-25T13:35:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I see you participated in this thread :)
2014-07-25T13:36:01 <Bosmon> https://www.mail-archive.com/fluid-work@fluidproject.org/msg07597.html
2014-07-25T13:38:08 <Bosmon> I guess this post talks mainly about test cases
2014-07-25T13:38:14 <Bosmon> But the issues are broadly similar
2014-07-25T13:38:44 <Bosmon> Of course there\'s no guarantee that fluid.focus() will work in NVDA either, but it\'s worth a try
2014-07-25T13:39:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, I\'ll try it out
2014-07-25T13:39:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - your message on the list seems to end as you were making a suggestion
2014-07-25T13:39:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, where did mail-archive come from? have we always had that?
2014-07-25T13:40:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have no idea - I just googled for posts from fluid-work
2014-07-25T13:40:20 <Bosmon> Your message ends with "You may want to try to experiment with putting an " -
2014-07-25T13:40:25 <Justin_o> oh ha.. i usually look at nabble http://fluid.2324889.n4.nabble.com/Fluid-Work-f3.html
2014-07-25T13:40:28 <Bosmon> Do you happen to remember what your suggestion was going to be?
2014-07-25T13:40:43 <Bosmon> I wonder how you manage to remember that URL :)
2014-07-25T13:42:02 <Justin_o> i just google for fluid-work nabble :)
2014-07-25T13:42:38 <Justin_o> i don\'t remember what i was going to put at the end though :( maybe it was a mistake since it\'s after my signature. I can only imagine it would have been to try to make it a live region or something like that
2014-07-25T13:42:46 <Justin_o> probably nothing completely useful

2014-07-25T14:03:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I tried switching to fluid.focus, but it didn\'t make a difference. At least not for NVDA
2014-07-25T14:07:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any other thoughts?
2014-07-25T14:30:18 * clown joined the channel
2014-07-25T14:30:48 * michelled joined the channel
2014-07-25T14:45:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you said that the element is focused shortly after it is created?
2014-07-25T14:46:08 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-07-25T14:47:51 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-07-25T14:47:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so this has to do with conditional panels in the prefs framework. so we have checkbox. if the value is true then other adjusters are show, if it is false, they are not. this is all controlled by the renderer.. so everything is rerendered when the state changes. Focus is pushed back onto the checkbox after the rendering process has completed
2014-07-25T14:47:55 <Bosmon> It\'s that noted DDAne,****KKASPPARNETTT****!
2014-07-25T14:49:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2014-07-25T14:49:43 <Bosmon> Have you tried doing something crude like throwing the focus action inside a setTimeout?
2014-07-25T14:53:02 <Justin_o> no i haven\'t tried that yet
2014-07-25T14:53:05 <Justin_o> i can give it a shot
2014-07-25T14:54:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, it works if we use role="application", although the jira is specifically to remove this as it produces some unwanted behaviour
2014-07-25T14:54:04 * clown welcomes kasparnet back
2014-07-25T14:54:31 <kasparnet> thanks clown
2014-07-25T14:57:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the setTimeout didn\'t help either
2014-07-25T14:58:08 <Justin_o> kasparnet: hope you had a good vacation
2014-07-25T14:59:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it seems awkward to have to remove the "application" role here, given I imagine we rely on it in quite a number of area of our interfaces
2014-07-25T15:00:04 <Bosmon> Perhaps it would be a better route to try to restore the arrow navigation?
2014-07-25T15:00:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think that would be confusing though, as the navigation is based on the mode which the screen reader is in
2014-07-25T15:00:54 <Bosmon> Although I guess this is related to the virtual cursor support
2014-07-25T15:01:30 <Justin_o> yes
2014-07-25T15:05:28 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-07-25T15:05:34 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure I have any further suggestions
2014-07-25T15:05:41 <Bosmon> Other than ones which might be rather unwelcome : P
2014-07-25T15:08:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks for your help.
2014-07-25T15:09:15 <Bosmon> That is, in theory, we could i) port the preferences framework to the new changeApplier, and then ii) completely eliminate the use of the old renderer : P
2014-07-25T15:09:31 <Bosmon> Both of these are things which need to happen, but I doubt they will happen on an appropriate timescale
2014-07-25T15:09:37 <Bosmon> But it\'s not clear that we really understand this problem yet
2014-07-25T15:10:15 <Bosmon> Perhaps you could construct some test cases with some dynamic content and dynamic focus, and see if you can get any insight into the conditions under which a screenreader will react to focus, and when it won\'t

2014-07-25T16:59:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i probably don\'t have time to construct the test cases just yet, but it make sense to do so. I think you may be right about needing to do the rewrite, and that it probably won\'t be done soon.
2014-07-25T17:13:36 <Bosmon> Thanks for the review, colinclark!
2014-07-25T17:13:43 <colinclark> DUDE
2014-07-25T17:14:09 <colinclark> Thanks for the more invertible valueMapper!
2014-07-25T17:14:27 <Bosmon> It is "pretty good" now

2014-07-25T17:14:47 <colinclark> I mean, michelled, check out these test cases: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/552/files#diff-2829282b19942f93881f61ac487dad30R1661
2014-07-25T17:14:51 <Bosmon> I think there is a bug in it that will manifest with more deeply nested values
2014-07-25T17:15:18 <colinclark> look at the crazy sorts of data lensing we are now able to do, both ways
2014-07-25T17:15:23 <colinclark> what\'s the nature of the bug?
2014-07-25T17:15:56 <Bosmon> If one of the values it is comparing "runs out of depth" too early, it will most likely throw an exception
2014-07-25T17:16:11 <Bosmon> I saw this as I was going through and kept meaning to fix it up
2014-07-25T17:16:25 <Bosmon> But this will be good enough for cindyli for now
2014-07-25T17:17:00 <Bosmon> It\'s impossible for this particular lensing arrangement to give rise to objects with mismatched depth
2014-07-25T17:17:07 <Bosmon> And they need to mismatch by 2 or more to trigger the bug
2014-07-25T17:18:54 <colinclark> ok
