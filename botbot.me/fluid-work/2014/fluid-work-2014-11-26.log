2014-11-26T20:46:05 <cindyli> hi kasparnet, in case you missed my earlier msg, this pull request https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/83 is ready to be merged
2014-11-26T20:50:58 <kasparnet> oh cool, cheers cindyli
2014-11-26T20:51:11 <cindyli> thanks, kasparnet
2014-11-26T20:54:20 * slim_jim joined the channel
2014-11-26T20:55:05 <jhernandez> clown: can you double-check that acceptance tests are not working? just to make sure that it\'s not my "double" fault :P
2014-11-26T20:56:00 <jhernandez> and I say double because I\'m getting the same problems both in a fresh Fedora box and in my laptop
2014-11-26T20:59:31 * slim_jim has quit
2014-11-26T20:59:32 <clown> jhernandaz, just getting back from a distraction.  Sure, I will check the acceptance tests in the next five minutes or so.
2014-11-26T21:00:55 <clown> oops.  I meant jhernandez ^
2014-11-26T21:02:42 <cindyli> Justin_o, Bosmon2, pls hold off reviewing my gpii pull request - https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/85. i\'m solving a styling issue after merging in the master. will let you know once it\'s ready to be reviewed.
2014-11-26T21:06:38 <clown> jhernandez:  it failed.
2014-11-26T21:06:43 <clown> "16:04:52.009:  jq: FAIL: Module "acceptanceTests.linux.builtIn tests" Test name "Testing os_gnome using Flat matchmaker" - Message: Unexpected failure in test case (see following log for more details): Cannot set property \'0\' of undefined"
2014-11-26T21:07:35 <clown> and the state of the magnifier and the theme is difficult to work with.  I\'m manually trying to get the system back to normal so I can see what I\'m doing, jhernandez.
2014-11-26T21:08:20 <jhernandez> clown: ok ok
2014-11-26T21:08:25 <jhernandez> thanks for the double check
2014-11-26T21:08:35 <jhernandez> that was what happened here
2014-11-26T21:09:22 <clown> actually, jhernandez, there is an earlier failure with repsect to alsa.
2014-11-26T21:09:28 <jhernandez> yup
2014-11-26T21:09:41 <clown> "16:04:51.982:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot set property \'0\' of undefined
2014-11-26T21:09:41 <clown> TypeError: Cannot set property \'0\' of undefined

2014-11-26T21:10:04 <clown> jhernandez:  how do I get back to a normal size mouse cursor?
2014-11-26T21:10:39 <jhernandez> made a quick fix to keep going, got another issue with gsettings and then I had to leave
2014-11-26T21:11:17 <jhernandez> clown: to get your cursor sizr back, dconf editor or gsettings
2014-11-26T21:11:29 <jhernandez> dunno if there\'s something in tweak tool
2014-11-26T21:11:33 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-11-26T21:11:33 <clown> right, but which setting?
2014-11-26T21:11:40 <clown> it\'s not a magnifier setting.
2014-11-26T21:12:08 <clown> I should know this.  I am embarrassed...
2014-11-26T21:12:08 <jhernandez> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size
2014-11-26T21:12:13 <jhernandez> ah
2014-11-26T21:12:16 <clown> thanks, jhernandez
2014-11-26T21:12:21 <jhernandez> and the screen magnifier
2014-11-26T21:12:51 <clown> oh, I know the screen magnifier settings.  too familiary you might say.
2014-11-26T21:12:56 <jhernandez> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications false
2014-11-26T21:12:59 <clown> *familiar
2014-11-26T21:13:22 <clown> "org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications.screen-magnifier-enabled" you mean
2014-11-26T21:13:30 <jhernandez> and, the value for cursor-size, I have 24
2014-11-26T21:13:50 <clown> 24 for "normal" or "factory setting"?
2014-11-26T21:13:52 <clown> thanks.
2014-11-26T21:14:05 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-11-26T21:14:17 <jhernandez> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-magnifier-enabled false
2014-11-26T21:15:18 <clown> this is weird.  the mouse cursor size appears to depend on which window it is over.
2014-11-26T21:15:25 <clown> very strange...
2014-11-26T21:15:55 <jhernandez> yeah, and I\'m quite sure that one window is firefox
2014-11-26T21:16:00 <jhernandez> isn\'t it?
2014-11-26T21:16:12 <cindyli> Justin_o and Bosmon2, my gpii pull request: https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/85 is ready to be reviewed. thanks!
2014-11-26T21:18:12 <clown> jhernandez, it appears to be FF and any terminal window.
2014-11-26T21:18:33 <clown> perhaps it\'s a text level setting?
2014-11-26T21:21:05 <jhernandez> IIRC, there\'s a report of that issue at bgo
2014-11-26T21:22:00 <jhernandez> but can\'t find it right now
2014-11-26T21:22:13 <clown> bgo?
2014-11-26T21:23:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: do we have a strategy for localization of a sentence that contains markup within.. for example "some <strong>important</strong> text"

2014-11-26T21:27:24 <clown> sorry, jhernandez, I meant bgo for a terminal bug?
2014-11-26T21:29:31 <clown> In fact, I get the big cursor in the "Files" app if I try to rename a file.  The cursror goes big in the text entry field.  I think this is relates to GTK somehow.
2014-11-26T21:29:57 <jhernandez> yeah, the problem is around gtk
2014-11-26T21:30:19 <clown> but, this is a distraction.  I\'m going to look at why the acceptance test fails.
2014-11-26T21:32:09 * cindyli has quit
2014-11-26T21:34:10 <kasparnet> jhernandez, clown: Things seem to be passing and working in windows
2014-11-26T21:34:21 <kasparnet> do you think I can be of any help with the linux stuff?
2014-11-26T21:36:30 <clown> not sure, kasparnet.
2014-11-26T21:36:39 <clown> I don\'t have anything to ask you, yet.
2014-11-26T21:38:10 <clown> kasparnet:  here is the top of a trace where the first failure occurs:
2014-11-26T21:38:10 <clown> gpii.contextManager.evaluateMatch called
2014-11-26T21:38:10 <clown> 16:34:39.944:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot set property \'0\' of undefined

2014-11-26T21:38:41 <clown> so, now I\'m looking at the alsa bridge to see if, well, I can see anything.
2014-11-26T21:39:51 <clown> and this is what I see:
2014-11-26T21:40:20 <clown> var app = fluid.copy(payload);
2014-11-26T21:40:20 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6
2014-11-26T21:40:20 <clown> app.data[0] = noOptions;
2014-11-26T21:41:00 <clown> for whatever reason app.data is undefined.
2014-11-26T21:41:44 <jhernandez> clown: *I think* I already fix that issue
2014-11-26T21:41:54 <jhernandez> *fixed
2014-11-26T21:42:35 <clown> okay, jhernandez.  Moving to the next one.
2014-11-26T21:44:21 <clown> namely, "16:34:39.965:  jq: Source:     at kettle.test.handleUncaughtException (/home/joseph/Development/GPII/DeviceReporter/node_modules/universal/node_modules/kettle/test/utils/js/KettleTestUtils.js:32:15)"
2014-11-26T21:46:50 <clown> ignore that.  it doesn\'t capture the actual locus of the failure.
2014-11-26T21:51:21 <jhernandez> ok
2014-11-26T21:51:48 <jhernandez> looks like all tests are passing
2014-11-26T21:53:30 <clown> \\o/
2014-11-26T21:54:40 <clown> jhernandez, by the way, to get the mouser cursor size back to normal everywhere, do "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor 1.0"
2014-11-26T21:54:46 <clown> *mouse cursor
2014-11-26T21:55:56 <clown> kasparnet, jhernandez, I have to leave now.  Javi, will there be a fix/patch that I can start with tomorrow?
2014-11-26T22:02:05 <jhernandez> clown: sure, just pushed it
2014-11-26T22:02:23 <jhernandez> https://github.com/amb26/linux/pull/1
2014-11-26T22:03:25 <clown> jhernandez, thanks.  maybe amb26 will have pulled it into his GPII-434 by the time I get here tomorrow morning.
2014-11-26T22:03:47 <jhernandez> kasparnet: still not finished with the full pass on linux, will ping you once I\'m done
2014-11-26T22:04:03 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, probably
2014-11-26T22:04:11 <jhernandez> Bosmon2: around?
2014-11-26T22:04:43 <clown> so long jhernandez, kasparnet.  Have a great evening.

2014-11-26T16:57:56 <kasparnet> I guess it could be a 32 vs 64 bit issue

2014-11-26T17:00:46 <slim_jim> kasparnet: A guess is that is a path issue?
2014-11-26T17:00:59 <slim_jim> Node should be on path

2014-11-26T18:17:44 <jhernandez> FYI, linux\' acceptanceTests are broken :/

2014-11-26T18:20:04 <clown> wow, and I\'ve barely started...
2014-11-26T18:20:17 <jhernandez> yeah, seems to be a problem with the implementation of get/set methods in some settings handler
2014-11-26T18:21:57 <jhernandez> first alsa\'s, fixed it, but now looks like the gsettings\' is failing too

2014-11-26T19:39:04 <kasparnet> Bosmon2: So I\'m now running the tests in windows - all tests pass, but they leave windows in it\'s limbo state, between applied and reset contrast theme
2014-11-26T19:39:20 <kasparnet> cindyli1: I dont know
2014-11-26T19:39:30 <kasparnet> I think it\'s only been tested in firefox and chrome
2014-11-26T19:39:45 <kasparnet> and I believe it\'s acceptable (in the context of C4A) that it only supports those two browsers
2014-11-26T19:39:50 <michelled> kasparnet: for the review, we\'ll be using FF or Chrome, right?
2014-11-26T19:40:00 <kasparnet> but I\'ll let colinclark and sgithens_____ weigh in on that
2014-11-26T19:40:06 <kasparnet> yes michelled
2014-11-26T19:40:43 <michelled> I would think that we should at least file JIRAs for IE issues

2014-11-26T19:51:38 <avtar> just wanted to check in with you to see how you were holding up. i\'ll message you tomorrow.
2014-11-26T19:52:20 <kasparnet> ok cool
2014-11-26T19:52:35 <avtar> kasparnet: that was me trying to be random and funny

2014-11-26T19:53:11 <kasparnet> lol
2014-11-26T19:53:48 <avtar> amatas reached out earlier this week saying he was looking into logstash. i wanted to log the issue on gpii\'s jira instance but wasn\'t sure if it\'s preferred that we set up a separate project for ops related tasks
2014-11-26T19:55:19 * anastasiac has quit
2014-11-26T19:55:24 <kasparnet> avtar: that\'s mostly up to you! It\'s definitely not a problem for us that you also use the GPII project. We can create any specific component, tag or whatever for you need there
2014-11-26T19:55:35 <kasparnet> michelled: dont know if you have some thoughts on this
2014-11-26T19:55:55 <kasparnet> avtar: so far we\'ve kept most of stuff in the GPII project
2014-11-26T19:56:07 <kasparnet> but we do have separate projects as well
2014-11-26T19:56:16 <kasparnet> so it mostly depends on how people prefer to work
2014-11-26T19:57:12 <kasparnet> ... Though it\'s a bit C4A centric right now, I imagine that once C4A ends, the GPII project will become a more general purpose overall tracker, in which case sysops might fit great
2014-11-26T19:57:18 <kasparnet> anyway - completely up to you
2014-11-26T19:59:43 * anastasiac joined the channel

2014-11-26T20:09:50 <kasparnet> ok cool
2014-11-26T20:19:32 <kasparnet> Bosmon2: Other than that it seems that the tests are at least passing consistently
2014-11-26T20:21:40 <clown> kasparnet:  I\'ve gotten to the point where I have run \'node tests/all-tests.js\' in universal ...
2014-11-26T20:21:49 <clown> I dumped the output to a file.
2014-11-26T20:21:53 <clown> It\'s rather large.

2014-11-26T20:23:39 <clown> kasparnet:  a question:  I see references to windows settings in the output.  But, I\'m running on linux.  Does that mean anything?
2014-11-26T20:25:02 <clown> clarification:  It looks like it gives up after a certain amount of time.
2014-11-26T20:25:16 <clown> for example:
2014-11-26T20:25:16 <clown> 15:18:01.218:  Settings have not settled to required values - retrying read at attempt 6 of 12 in 1000ms
2014-11-26T20:25:16 <clown> 15:18:02.087:  Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 6 of 16 sequence element {
2014-11-26T20:25:43 <clown> better quote:
2014-11-26T20:25:43 <clown> 15:18:01.218:  Settings have not settled to required values - retrying read at attempt 6 of 12 in 1000ms
2014-11-26T20:25:43 <clown> 15:18:02.087:  Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 6 of 16 sequence element {
2014-11-26T20:25:43 <clown> "event": "{loginRequest}.events.onComplete",
2014-11-26T20:25:43 <clown> "listener": "gpii.test.loginRequestListen"
2014-11-26T20:25:43 <clown> } of fixture Testing os_win7 using Flat matchmaker
2014-11-26T20:27:50 <kasparnet> clown: yeah - so part of Bosmon2\'s work was to ensure that settings handlers will continue to set the settings (ie. do a set, then a few reads, then another set) until the settings are actually set
2014-11-26T20:28:20 <kasparnet> so those tests are on purpose made in a way that the settings aren\'t properly set the first couple of times
2014-11-26T20:28:40 <kasparnet> so that\'s the "attempt 6 of 12" part
2014-11-26T20:28:42 <clown> okay, but my quesion was, should I see Windows7 tests running on a linux box?
2014-11-26T20:28:51 <kasparnet> in terms of the windows settings - that\'s another part of antranigs work
2014-11-26T20:29:00 <clown> intuitively, this seems odd...
2014-11-26T20:29:38 <kasparnet> we now have "integration tests" which will run all the platform specific tests as well on any platform - all the endpoints (ie. those that are usually binding to platform) are mocked so they dont actually write anything to the system
2014-11-26T20:30:19 <kasparnet> so they mimic the acceptance tests (which actually depend on the platform) all the way up to the point where settings are actually set and processes are launched
2014-11-26T20:30:28 <clown> is the quick answer:  "yes you should see Win7 tests running on a linux box.  Don\'t fret."
2014-11-26T20:30:30 <kasparnet> excluding those, that is
2014-11-26T20:30:36 <kasparnet> yes, it is
2014-11-26T20:31:02 <kasparnet> so all those (win tests and the "attempt x of y") are expected
2014-11-26T20:31:23 <clown> Ok cool. Thanks.  A second question...
2014-11-26T20:31:30 <kasparnet> sure
2014-11-26T20:32:03 <clown> I didn\'t run "grunt start" before running those tests.  I think that\'s okay since these don\'t depend on any real service.  Is that right?
2014-11-26T20:33:49 * clown crickets
2014-11-26T20:33:56 * clown ;-)
2014-11-26T20:35:37 <kasparnet> clown: lol, sorry - in a windows VM most of the time so dont get notifications of pings
2014-11-26T20:35:41 <kasparnet> yes, that\'s correct
2014-11-26T20:35:52 <kasparnet> tests dont depend on the system running
2014-11-26T20:36:05 <clown> and, do the acceptance tests require a "grunt start"?  Or just the in browser tests?
2014-11-26T20:36:08 <kasparnet> (actually I think they\'d fail as some of them use the same port)
2014-11-26T20:36:18 <kasparnet> none of the tests should require a grunt start
2014-11-26T20:36:23 <kasparnet> that\'s only for manual testing
2014-11-26T20:36:31 <clown> interesting...
2014-11-26T20:36:39 <kasparnet> (ie. starting the server and plugging in a USB or the like)
2014-11-26T20:37:10 <kasparnet> yeah - so both acceptance tests and integration tests have as a first step in their lifecycle to launch the server, and as a last step to stop it)
2014-11-26T20:37:31 <clown> okay.  That was going to be the last thing I did.  First: node tests.  Second:  accpetance tests.  Third browser tests.  Fourth:  manual tests with usb sticks and rfid readers.
2014-11-26T20:38:11 <clown> and, it\'s only "Fourth" that requires a "grunt start" (or a running system).

2014-11-26T13:51:48 <colinclark> Can you review this incredibly minor pull request? https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/pull/6/files
2014-11-26T13:51:57 <colinclark> I don\'t know what our process for merging changes like this is
2014-11-26T13:52:07 <colinclark> Really, it\'s the kind of thing I imagine I should be able ot push directly
2014-11-26T13:52:25 <colinclark> this updates node-jqUnit to depend on the latest head revision of Infusion

2014-11-26T13:53:07 <michelled> sure
2014-11-26T13:53:15 <colinclark> thanks
2014-11-26T13:53:26 <colinclark> node-jqUnit has a suite of tests that you can run to verify it
2014-11-26T13:53:38 <colinclark> with a nice little README explaining the results
2014-11-26T13:53:43 <colinclark> shouldn\'t take more than a couple minutes, I hope
2014-11-26T14:02:32 <michelled> I commented on your pull colinclark - but I suppose I can just push it

2014-11-26T15:47:22 <kasparnet> jhernandez: our steps
2014-11-26T15:47:26 <kasparnet> 1) Do fresh install of GPII - and ensure install instructions are correct and updated
2014-11-26T15:47:26 <kasparnet> 2) Run all tests (universal, web-based, platform specific)
2014-11-26T15:47:26 <kasparnet> 3) Log in with a handful of users, both via URL, USB and RFID
2014-11-26T15:47:27 <kasparnet> 4) Drink champagne

2014-11-26T16:02:34 <danaayotte> colinclark or kasparnet, could either of you elaborate on this comment I found in the cambridge notes re: MM feedback "(A USER CAN ONLY ADJUST AUTO-CONFIGURED SETTINGS PER APPLICATION)."
2014-11-26T16:02:46 <colinclark> DANER
2014-11-26T16:02:50 <danaayotte> HELLO
2014-11-26T16:03:19 <colinclark> I can\'t really identify that comment
2014-11-26T16:03:24 <colinclark> kasparnet might remember
2014-11-26T16:03:26 <colinclark> or Claudia might knwo
2014-11-26T16:03:45 <colinclark> I was a bit flaked out for that particular conversation, if I remember correctly
2014-11-26T16:03:52 <danaayotte> no worries colinclark
2014-11-26T16:04:03 <danaayotte> it was preceded by this: Investigate frequency and \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d of adjusting the auto-configuration
2014-11-26T16:06:40 <danaayotte> it was in red and all-caps conlinclark kasparnet so I thought it must be important :)
2014-11-26T16:27:04 <kasparnet> danaayotte: I think this has to do with the PCP only supporting settings per application
2014-11-26T16:27:22 <kasparnet> ie. it cant show general "fontSize" settings unless it\'s scoped to an application
2014-11-26T16:27:40 <kasparnet> as such an adjuster would require another round of matchmaking to figure out what to do with the system
2014-11-26T16:29:42 <danaayotte> thanks kasparnet.
2014-11-26T16:30:30 <danaayotte> This would not affect the user directly though, is that right kasparnet?
