2014-10-03T12:36:15 <amilchev> Justin_o: super quick: how can I get the class of a selector?
2014-10-03T12:37:11 <amilchev> e.g. selectors: {sth: ".flc-justin-obara"};  ...  how can I ask for sth\'s class (I guess kinda like fluid.allocateSimpleId, but for class)

2014-10-03T12:52:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you mean through the component options it would be like {that}.options.sth
2014-10-03T12:53:05 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you mean through the dom it would be something like that.locate("sth").attr("class");
2014-10-03T12:53:58 <Justin_o> the latter will give you all the classes on an element
2014-10-03T12:55:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeah thx, forgot I can just do the 1st thing you mentioned : )
2014-10-03T12:57:50 <Justin_o> amilchev: :) no problem
2014-10-03T12:58:19 <Justin_o> amilchev: be careful though that you don\'t assume it is a class. Selectors can be any valid jQuery selector

2014-10-03T12:59:49 <amilchev> Justin_o: I don\'t - I just need it for the jqUnit browser assert funcs https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/jqUnit/js/jqUnit-browser.js#L38
2014-10-03T13:01:16 <amilchev> and I see it\'s being passed as a selector (not necessarily a class)
