2014-02-10T20:45:19 <anastasiac> Bosmon, regarding the ChangeApplier changes that made it into master this weekend: Is there anything that needs to change in the docs, any API changes? Is there anything that an integrator upgrading would need to change about how they work with appliers?
2014-02-10T20:45:33 <Bosmon> anastasiac - these are mostly described in my page "Notes on the New ChangeApplier"
2014-02-10T20:45:36 <Bosmon> In most terms the API has stayed visibly the same, but its semantic is now rather different
2014-02-10T20:46:13 <Bosmon> Although I am recommending that we now switch to using the method named "change" from the one named "requestChange"
2014-02-10T20:46:16 <Bosmon> They have the same signature
2014-02-10T20:46:23 <Bosmon> The name "requestChange" should be deprecated
2014-02-10T20:48:05 <anastasiac> Other than deprecation of requestChange, we don\'t expect integrators to need to change their code, if they\'ve got something that worked before?
2014-02-10T20:49:41 <anastasiac> Bosmon, are you referring to http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/New+Notes+on+the+ChangeApplier or http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Technical+Notes+on+the+New+ChangeApplier+Implementation+-+FLUID-5045 ?
2014-02-10T20:49:55 <Bosmon> anastasiac - the former
2014-02-10T20:50:11 <Bosmon> The latter is only suitable for those interested in working on or reviewing the source
2014-02-10T20:50:43 <anastasiac> and Bosmon, in summary: Other than deprecation of requestChange, we don\'t expect integrators to need to change their code, if they\'ve got something that worked before?
2014-02-10T20:50:59 <Bosmon> anastasiac - "in theory", yes
2014-02-10T20:51:07 <anastasiac> :-)
2014-02-10T20:51:12 <Bosmon> But this issue highlights the difference between documenting the form of an API and the actual meaning of it
2014-02-10T20:51:43 <Bosmon> "New Notes on the ChangeApplier" is as long as it is since the changes have been mostly those in meaning
2014-02-10T20:51:58 <Bosmon> Apart from the withdrawn functionality, for example, such as "guards"/"postGuards" etc.

2014-02-10T20:58:47 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I\'ll read through the page and try to work out how to document it concisely. FYI, just a heads-up: I tried the latest infusion with the VideoPlayer, and got a "that.applier" is not defined in the main component. Only just starting to investigate...
2014-02-10T20:59:14 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I wouldn\'t try upgrading the VideoPlayer for now
2014-02-10T20:59:23 <Bosmon> There will be numerous issues that prevent us from integrating it
2014-02-10T20:59:30 <anastasiac> oh!
2014-02-10T21:00:03 <Bosmon> Integrating the VideoPlayer will be blocked by this issue: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5249
2014-02-10T21:03:52 <anastasiac> ok, Bosmon, thanks for the info. I\'ll keep an eye on that JIRA
2014-02-10T21:14:45 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o__, I have sent an email with the draft Foundation discussion.
2014-02-10T21:15:03 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung, I\'ll have a look
