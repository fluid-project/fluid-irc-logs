b'2014-03-13T21:25:19 <simonjb> Bosmon: got it, thanks!
2014-03-13T21:25:23 <Bosmon> Although the issue is more with npm\'s behaviour rather than node\'s
2014-03-13T21:25:42 <Bosmon> We currently have (at least) two separate paths by which infusion is included into the GPII\'s overall image
2014-03-13T21:25:53 <Bosmon> Firstly as a direct dependency of GPII\'s universal, and then as an indirect dependency of kettle
2014-03-13T21:26:18 <simonjb> yes, I see that on my filesystem
2014-03-13T21:26:24 <Bosmon> It used to be the case that the old version of npm detected that the two hashes of these referenced infusion modules were identical, and arranged it so that only one was in fact included
2014-03-13T21:26:41 <simonjb> I deleted the kettle infusion and was able to get past the error
2014-03-13T21:26:49 <Bosmon> This behaviour changed within the last few months so that we get two independent copies, which then unfortunately makes the resulting system non-viable
2014-03-13T21:27:16 <Bosmon> The main way we can see out of this task is to work on a grunt plugin that allows us to bypass npm\'s workflow for this module fetching
2014-03-13T21:27:23 <Bosmon> out of this problem
2014-03-13T21:27:44 <Bosmon> Or even most simply a grunt task which just deletes duplicate copies of modules post-installation
2014-03-13T21:28:00 <simonjb> we\'d still be relying on node\'s module caching, right?
2014-03-13T21:28:14 <Bosmon> But actually npm is outrageously slow at the task of updating dependencies, and we think that a custom grunt plugin would ease a lot of pain around the community
2014-03-13T21:28:22 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s right, but that can always be depended on
2014-03-13T21:28:29 <simonjb> ok
2014-03-13T21:28:39 <Bosmon> Since it is part of the "common modules spec" or whatever it is called these days
2014-03-13T21:29:30 <simonjb> it\'s not node specific but rather part of the agreed upon js module semantics?
2014-03-13T21:29:52 <Bosmon> I believe the agreement on that is somewhat wider than just the node community per se, yes
2014-03-13T21:30:17 <Bosmon> Although probably in practice the node community is by far the vaster majority of people operating js module systems
2014-03-13T21:30:19 <simonjb> http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules
2014-03-13T21:30:22 <Bosmon> yes
2014-03-13T21:30:23 <Bosmon> that one
2014-03-13T21:30:25 <simonjb> ok
2014-03-13T21:33:46 <Bosmon> Well, I assumed that the caching behaviour was part of this spec
2014-03-13T21:33:50 <Bosmon> But so far I haven\'t found it yet
2014-03-13T21:35:35 <simonjb> the nearest I see is "That is to say module.id can be passed to another module, and requiring that must return the original module" but it\'s not clear to me what that means http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1
2014-03-13T21:35:40 <Bosmon> Ok well, amazingly it seems that it is not part of the spec
2014-03-13T21:35:55 <Bosmon> Anyway, I think we have no alternative but to depend on it : P
2014-03-13T21:36:07 <Bosmon> I found this interesting property in the node docs
2014-03-13T21:36:08 <Bosmon> http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#globals_require_cache
2014-03-13T21:36:17 <Bosmon> Which allows you to explicitly flush the cache for a module
2014-03-13T21:36:23 <Bosmon> This will be quite useful for us later
2014-03-13T21:36:23 <simonjb> certainly we do depend on it :)
2014-03-13T21:37:20 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, each day I understand a little bit more :)
2014-03-13T21:37:26 <Bosmon> Me too ....

2014-03-13T15:10:29 <jhernandez> oops
2014-03-13T15:10:33 <jhernandez> that\'s true
2014-03-13T15:54:43 <clown> so, jhernandez, do you have time now?
2014-03-13T16:02:33 <jhernandez> yes!
2014-03-13T16:02:38 <clown> jhernandez:  I found a bug in the new UI.  I don\'t know if it was in my original patch.  To make a long story short, there is a one line fix.
2014-03-13T16:02:52 <clown> Should I re-open the bug and upload the patch?
2014-03-13T16:03:06 <jhernandez> which bug?
2014-03-13T16:03:15 * clown looks up the number.
2014-03-13T16:03:18 <jhernandez> well
2014-03-13T16:03:27 <jhernandez> better question ...

2014-03-13T16:03:36 <clown> yes.
2014-03-13T16:04:25 <jhernandez> ok
2014-03-13T16:04:57 <jhernandez> but it\'s better if you can file a new one
2014-03-13T16:05:19 <clown> I can do that too.
2014-03-13T16:05:30 <jhernandez> better
2014-03-13T16:05:45 <clown> yes, but what would be best?
2014-03-13T16:05:48 <clown> ignore that  :-)
2014-03-13T16:06:00 <jhernandez> and remember that a screenshot is more valuable than thousands of words
2014-03-13T16:06:02 <jhernandez> :)
2014-03-13T16:06:27 <clown> It\'s the same screenshot as before.
2014-03-13T16:06:34 <clown> Unless you mean a screen shot of the error.
2014-03-13T16:06:49 <jhernandez> yeah, just the error
2014-03-13T16:07:03 <clown> hokay.  Sometime later this afternoon, then.
