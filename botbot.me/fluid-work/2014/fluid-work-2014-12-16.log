2014-12-16T11:40:18 <Bosmon> There's some interesting talk about preferences filtering in the logs from last night
2014-12-16T11:40:23 <Bosmon> Me and colinclark were having a chat
2014-12-16T11:56:22 <kasparnet> cool
2014-12-16T11:56:34 <kasparnet> will read up on that tonight

2014-12-16T13:46:05 <Justin_o> michelled: hello
2014-12-16T13:46:19 <michelled> I was listening in on the face to face in Athens, and it seems like we need to come up with a scenario for showing off the security work
2014-12-16T13:46:40 <michelled> I was wondering if you had some thoughts on what that might look like
2014-12-16T13:49:10 <Justin_o> michelled: i don't know much about the integration of the security server with apps and services, but i can bullet point the workflow once a user is redirected to the authorization server

2014-12-16T14:19:08 <simonjb> Justin_o: due to Windows path length limitations, we moved the sample clients to /examples
2014-12-16T14:20:08 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks

2014-12-16T14:42:35 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon
2014-12-16T14:43:10 <Justin_o> simonjb: things seem to work
2014-12-16T14:46:58 <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, the 'z' was intentional, short for authori_z_ation
2014-12-16T14:47:19 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay cool, just double checking
2014-12-16T14:47:23 <simonjb> Justin_o: that's great that it is working

2014-12-16T01:14:58 <colinclark> Bosmon / Bosmon7: over here
2014-12-16T01:15:08 <colinclark> I was rambling privately
2014-12-16T01:15:17 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-12-16T01:15:21 <Bosmon> Let me paste my original question
2014-12-16T01:15:40 <Bosmon> Well, I didn\'t manage to ask it very directly
2014-12-16T01:15:45 <colinclark> no
2014-12-16T01:15:49 <colinclark> so go for it again
2014-12-16T01:15:57 <colinclark> or i could just ramble out of context if you\'d prefer
2014-12-16T01:16:06 <Bosmon> But my architectural worry was whether the "inverseCapabilities" record that we have will become relevant for the profile privacy filtering work
2014-12-16T01:16:26 <Bosmon> And the vehicle by which I am trying to imagine that they might become relevant is the following:
2014-12-16T01:16:55 * jhung has quit
2014-12-16T01:17:55 <Bosmon> In the preference sets that we are required to filter (for the demo, or otherwise) - are we expecting that the privacy filter will have its effect applied to preferences which are encoded as application-specific terms
2014-12-16T01:18:07 <Bosmon> Which - whilst they are being dispatched directly to the application, actually happen to have a capabilitiesTransformation that would imply we could interpret them as matching the filter if we wanted
2014-12-16T01:18:25 <colinclark> oh oh
2014-12-16T01:18:26 <colinclark> ok
2014-12-16T01:18:31 <colinclark> I was rambling about something else entirely
2014-12-16T01:18:37 <Bosmon> oh
2014-12-16T01:18:41 <Bosmon> really?
2014-12-16T01:18:43 <colinclark> The UI for determining which preferences should be shared
2014-12-16T01:18:59 <colinclark> But of course you actually have to filter a real preference set
2014-12-16T01:19:04 <colinclark> regardless of what\'s in it
2014-12-16T01:19:17 <Bosmon> And furthermore, I was asking whether this was the same question which was being asked in the piratepad for the "Security Meeting Notes, December 8th 2014"
2014-12-16T01:19:23 <Bosmon> Of which the last two notes read:
2014-12-16T01:19:32 <Bosmon> the windows and linux specific parts are used for the PCP - and can be ignored in terms of security for now, I believe... since our security doesn\'t speak application specific
2014-12-16T01:19:32 <Bosmon> what does it mean that we don\'t "speak application specific?"
2014-12-16T01:19:47 <colinclark> I think my question was fairly literal
2014-12-16T01:19:59 <colinclark> I don\'t actually know what kasparnet meant there
2014-12-16T01:20:11 <colinclark> Thinking about the bigger picture
2014-12-16T01:20:33 <colinclark> We have to really tease out what an "application-specific" setting means, from the intention of the user
2014-12-16T01:20:42 <Bosmon> Yes well
2014-12-16T01:20:43 <colinclark> Presumably these things get there via one of two ways
2014-12-16T01:20:50 <Bosmon> Thinking primarily in terms of the apps we are demoing next month
2014-12-16T01:21:02 <colinclark> 1. A third-party application has been given write access to the preference set and has put them there itself
2014-12-16T01:21:11 <colinclark> 2. A user has run some kind of snapshotter
2014-12-16T01:21:12 <Bosmon> it appears that most of the apparently "application-specific settings" that they deal in are really proxies for perfectly standard and ontologised preferences
2014-12-16T01:21:21 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:21:30 <Bosmon> But the only way for us to detect this fact would be if anyone supplied a capabilities transformation revealing this fact
2014-12-16T01:21:43 <colinclark> yes, I think that\'s correct
2014-12-16T01:21:55 <Bosmon> But looking at this, it seems to me that this could only become helpful to us in filtering them if we also happened to have the INVERSE for this transformation encoded
2014-12-16T01:22:03 <Bosmon> Which we currently do in our appalling centrally-coded hack
2014-12-16T01:22:12 <colinclark> yes, that\'s right
2014-12-16T01:22:22 <colinclark> Allow me the luxury of saying too much, just so I can think clearly
2014-12-16T01:22:48 <colinclark> In case #2 above, I think we\'ve decided that the only way snapshotting will ever work reliably is if the user actually chooses stuff they want to include
2014-12-16T01:23:00 <colinclark> so it\'s a kind of implicit permission to access
2014-12-16T01:23:06 <Bosmon> "actually chooses"
2014-12-16T01:23:08 <colinclark> in case #1, we should be very suspicious
2014-12-16T01:23:14 <Bosmon> I think that you have still not said too much :)
2014-12-16T01:23:54 <colinclark> well, we talked about a UI in the snapshotter where a user can see what\'s been collected and choose to omit/include certain types/applications/categories of preferences
2014-12-16T01:23:57 <Bosmon> has put them there itself......
2014-12-16T01:23:59 <Bosmon> "itself"
2014-12-16T01:24:02 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:24:07 <colinclark> that part is more curious
2014-12-16T01:24:14 <Bosmon> So I am also puzzled by this idea of applications "doing things"
2014-12-16T01:24:22 <colinclark> :)
2014-12-16T01:24:27 <colinclark> Think of an app that embeds UIO
2014-12-16T01:24:38 <colinclark> since both of our target integrations are, no surprise, apps that embed UIO
2014-12-16T01:24:46 <Bosmon> If the user has a privacy filter that says, "do not allow app X access to my screenreader settings"
2014-12-16T01:24:55 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:25:12 <Bosmon> You would imagine that the only honest embodiment of this is a system, not to say also a UI, which does also not allow app X to WRITE these settings
2014-12-16T01:25:17 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:25:28 <Bosmon> This is, of course, far, far out of scope
2014-12-16T01:25:31 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:25:43 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-12-16T01:25:49 <colinclark> but it means we absolutely must no, one way or another, which application-specific preferences belong to which category
2014-12-16T01:26:02 <colinclark> where the categories are defined by the ontology of the preferences editor
2014-12-16T01:26:07 <Bosmon> So this is implying that, for this as well as your original reason, that this is out of scope for this review
2014-12-16T01:26:17 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:26:18 <Bosmon> Given that we will have already constructed the user\'s preferences that we will demonstrate
2014-12-16T01:26:27 <colinclark> Presumably this is what kasparnet meant
2014-12-16T01:26:31 <Bosmon> Therefore we only require to catch preferences "coming out the other way"
2014-12-16T01:26:35 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:26:46 <colinclark> and so I think it\'s safe to say that those preferences sets can consist entirely of common terms
2014-12-16T01:26:47 <Bosmon> That is, a so-called "common term" which is about to be encoded as an "application-specific preference"
2014-12-16T01:27:09 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:27:11 <colinclark> correct
2014-12-16T01:27:14 <Bosmon> Which only adds further beef to our insistence that the "security gateway" could only ever have been implemented in an integrated way
2014-12-16T01:27:19 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:27:32 <colinclark> this is viable now because Christophe kindly added transformations for most of the OLB
2014-12-16T01:27:39 <colinclark> we still need to ensure that Easit4All has comparable ones
2014-12-16T01:27:48 <colinclark> but I\'d assume they\'re ultimately identical to OLB\'s
2014-12-16T01:28:03 <Bosmon> I am now dimly starting to remember my realisation that in a completely full system, filtering would need to be applied at AT LEAST TWO POINTS in the payload processing chain
2014-12-16T01:28:08 <colinclark> since it\'s the same machinery on the other side
2014-12-16T01:28:09 <colinclark> UIO
2014-12-16T01:28:29 <Bosmon> ok
2014-12-16T01:28:34 <colinclark> Can you explicitly list the two points, just so we\'re clear?
2014-12-16T01:28:35 <Bosmon> Well this has made things a lot clearer, thanks
2014-12-16T01:28:40 <colinclark> It\'s not ideal
2014-12-16T01:28:44 <Bosmon> Well I am suspecting now that there might be three
2014-12-16T01:28:53 <colinclark> more workaround for the demo, but we have to get something done
2014-12-16T01:28:58 <Bosmon> So, the preferences come out of the preferences set as they stand
2014-12-16T01:29:05 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:29:08 <Bosmon> Under our current workflow, they get "inverse capabilised"
2014-12-16T01:29:24 <Bosmon> At which point further things which were ontologisable become ontologisable
2014-12-16T01:29:32 <Bosmon> Sorry, "than were"
2014-12-16T01:29:37 <colinclark> right
2014-12-16T01:30:15 <Bosmon> ok, so we need to have a stage of filtering right here
2014-12-16T01:30:24 <Bosmon> NOW, the thing gets dispatched to a matchmaker
2014-12-16T01:30:39 <Bosmon> Oh wait
2014-12-16T01:30:45 <Bosmon> wrong order : P
2014-12-16T01:30:51 <Bosmon> no filtering yet
2014-12-16T01:30:56 <Bosmon> because applications have not yet been allocated
2014-12-16T01:31:35 <Bosmon> ok so perhaps I have overegged
2014-12-16T01:31:44 <Bosmon> There is still only the point of filtering that we already planned
2014-12-16T01:31:58 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:31:59 <colinclark> ok
2014-12-16T01:32:02 <Bosmon> Which is, AFTER the act of the matchmatchmaker, AFTER the act of the context manager, but BEFORE the act of the transformer
2014-12-16T01:32:07 <colinclark> yes, that\'s correct
2014-12-16T01:32:26 <Bosmon> Just before the transformer "kicks over the traces" of where in the ontology the allocated settings were
2014-12-16T01:33:02 <colinclark> AFTER ontologizing app-specific terms, but BEFORE transformation back to app-specific
2014-12-16T01:33:05 <colinclark> correct?
2014-12-16T01:33:20 <colinclark> there\'s a huge gap int there, as you point out
2014-12-16T01:33:27 <colinclark> matchmaking, context, etc.
2014-12-16T01:33:35 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-12-16T01:33:37 <colinclark> ok
2014-12-16T01:33:56 <Bosmon> Now, in our "very full system" we would do something more complex at this point - which would be to "inverse capabilise" things which had already become application-specific settings to see if they actually corresponded to things that the user might have wanted filtered out
2014-12-16T01:34:38 <Bosmon> They might "already have become" application-specific through having ALWAYS been application-specific and having passed unchanged through the whole matchmaking process
2014-12-16T01:34:47 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:34:53 <Bosmon> Or they might have become application-specific because some kind of "hostile matchmaker" had so encoded them
2014-12-16T01:35:03 <Bosmon> Although the latter is a pretty wacky risk in reality
2014-12-16T01:35:14 <colinclark> indeed
2014-12-16T01:35:30 <Bosmon> And as per KASPERNET\'s realisation at SD, is something we could never effectively guard against in a world where a "fully statistical matchmaker" were deployed
2014-12-16T01:35:55 <Bosmon> Given this kind of matchmaker could always "leak by correlation" rather than "by direct implication"
2014-12-16T01:36:06 <colinclark> It\'s a risk a user would have to take, assuming there were such a Matchmaker in production...
2014-12-16T01:36:14 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-12-16T01:36:20 <colinclark> Either this kind of statistical inference or privacy, period
2014-12-16T01:36:34 <Bosmon> Especially if they had specially ticked that preference in their set which said, "use this kind of matchmaker" : P
2014-12-16T01:36:42 <colinclark> Not only do you agree to share your data for statistical mining by the Matchmaker
2014-12-16T01:37:19 <colinclark> but implicitly you accept the risk that preferences will slip past any privacy policies you may have put in place
2014-12-16T01:37:32 <colinclark> thus you\'re potentially sharing anything with any app
2014-12-16T01:39:36 <Bosmon> It\'s a quite funny way of being "hoist by ones own petard"... since the use of data mining in order to build the statistical matchmaker is exactly what enables the use of data mining on the part of hostile apps in order to discover the original contents of a user\'s preference set
2014-12-16T01:41:13 <colinclark> yes
2014-12-16T01:41:15 <colinclark> exactly
2014-12-16T01:41:33 <Bosmon> The only possible defence is for each author of a matchmaker to also supply an "inverse matchmaker"
2014-12-16T01:42:02 <Bosmon> Well..... would even that be good enough.....
2014-12-16T01:42:13 <Bosmon> I guess it would
2014-12-16T01:42:33 <Bosmon> No
2014-12-16T01:42:37 <Bosmon> I think it probably wouldn\'t
2014-12-16T01:43:19 <Bosmon> It isn\'t enough for it to take the user\'s privacy profile as an input argument, you need to know what it will do on every possible preference set
2014-12-16T01:44:27 <Bosmon> Just because it was able to "invert" a set of permissible application settings onto a particular part of a user preference set, doesn\'t prove to you that it will map that part, wherever it occurs, back onto a permissible application setting
2014-12-16T01:44:53 <colinclark> right
