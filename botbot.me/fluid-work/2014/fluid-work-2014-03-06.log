2014-03-06T18:57:38 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, is http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4884 the best Jira ticket to use for tracking the debugger work? (for branch name, associating each commit with a Jira ticket)
2014-03-06T19:06:49 * jash4 has quit
2014-03-06T19:13:40 <jhung> simonjb: I've pushed up changes to FLUID-5276. I've also added a comment to the Jira regarding the use of a new class that adds the hiding/showing transition effect.
2014-03-06T19:14:24 <simonjb> jhung: awesome, will merge in; thanks!
2014-03-06T19:14:58 <jhung> simonjb: let me know if you want to talk through it.
2014-03-06T19:15:23 <simonjb> jhung: can you make a pull request? Is that the right process?
2014-03-06T19:22:22 <jhung> simonjb: sure that would work. Or you could add my repository as a remote, and then do a fetch on my repo and merge my FLUID-5276 branch.
2014-03-06T19:23:37 <jhung> ^Justin_o: would there be any technical reason why we would use one approach over the other?
2014-03-06T19:23:50 <jhung> I've done both. End results are the same. :)
2014-03-06T19:24:58 <simonjb> thanks jhung; I'll wait for input from Justin_o but either is good for me and I'll let you know if I have any questions
2014-03-06T19:27:27 <Bosmon> simonjb - seems good yes
2014-03-06T19:27:32 <Bosmon> We might start refining it over time
2014-03-06T19:27:46 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon

2014-03-06T19:40:03 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, i'm ok. working on achecker today, haven't tried the solution we talked yesterday
2014-03-06T19:45:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think the metric in the colour game is broken : P
2014-03-06T19:45:32 <Bosmon> I was set a problem where I've got to the point where every change makes the metric worse, but I am not at the solution ....
2014-03-06T19:45:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - ah ok
2014-03-06T19:46:58 <Bosmon> hah, now I found a value for which the proximity was 99.26% but it admitted that the solution was right

2014-03-06T20:43:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  you might find this blog post about the game helpful http://lea.verou.me/2014/02/whathecolor-a-color-game-for-web-developers/
2014-03-06T20:43:49 <Justin_o> she talks about the proximity issue
2014-03-06T20:48:35 <Justin_o> simonjb, jhung: from a technical perspective they are identical, since you'd need to merge anyways. It's more of a process issue. Pull request are a bit more open and easy to track, if that's something you need. But if they are just for things you are talking about and working on together at roughly the same time, it will be easier to just do the merge
2014-03-06T20:48:35 <Justin_o> without the pull request.
2014-03-06T20:49:04 <Justin_o> of course you'll need to do a pull request to get things into the master branch of the project repo, but that is a different case altogether.
2014-03-06T20:50:22 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o; jhung, I'll just merge if that works for you
