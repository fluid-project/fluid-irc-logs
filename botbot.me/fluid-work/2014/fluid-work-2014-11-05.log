2014-11-05T19:46:26 <colinclark> Justin_o: We have 10,000 client licenses per year
2014-11-05T19:46:55 <colinclark> We have a few outstanding questions about how we\xe2\x80\x99ll manage license activations
2014-11-05T19:47:29 <colinclark> so people who have accounts (which means they have privileges to send out invites) should just be very judicious in using invites
2014-11-05T19:51:18 <Justin_o> colinclark, michelled: we're in the standup room now
2014-11-05T19:51:40 <michelled> I'm there too :)

2014-11-05T16:02:09 <andres__> hi
2014-11-05T16:03:23 <michelled> hi andres__!
2014-11-05T16:03:33 <michelled> Justin_o and cindyli can answer Infusion questions :)
2014-11-05T16:04:25 <andres__> i was following the tutorial to make my own bargraph and it says to copy the infusion-all.js file
2014-11-05T16:04:31 <andres__> but i cannot find this file
2014-11-05T16:09:58 <Justin_o> andres__: hello
2014-11-05T16:10:28 <Justin_o> andres__: do you have a checkout of infusion?
2014-11-05T16:11:16 <andres__> i have downloaded it from https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/releases/tag/infusion-1.5
2014-11-05T16:12:10 <andres__> the zip one (just writing this rang a bell to download the tar.gz )
2014-11-05T16:12:33 <Justin_o> andres__: okay.. cool.. to get the infusion-all.js file you\'ll need to build that. Unfortunately it doesn\'t look like we\'ve posted a pre-built version, but running a build isn\'t too difficult.
2014-11-05T16:12:39 <Justin_o> you can see the instructions here https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/infusion-1.5#how-do-i-create-an-infusion-package
2014-11-05T16:12:50 <Justin_o> basically you\'ll need to have node and grunt installed
2014-11-05T16:13:02 <Justin_o> do you already have those on your system?
2014-11-05T16:13:08 <andres__> yes
2014-11-05T16:13:31 <Justin_o> okay great, then you can do an npm install in the root directory and then just run "grunt"
2014-11-05T16:13:55 <Justin_o> that will create a build for you that you can use.. it will show up as a zip file in the products directory
2014-11-05T16:13:58 <andres__> i have the "new" npm required by gpii, is that a problem?
2014-11-05T16:14:38 <Justin_o> i don\'t think so, not that I\'m aware of anyways.. Infusion didn\'t have the same node issues that we ran into for gpii
2014-11-05T16:15:42 <andres__> thanks, i\'m doing the npm install
2014-11-05T16:20:45 <andres__> done! thanks a lot :-)
2014-11-05T16:20:59 <Justin_o> andres__: np let me know if you have any more questions
2014-11-05T16:21:34 <andres__> now i\'m wondering if src/framework/fss is the same as products\\infusion\\framework\\fss
2014-11-05T16:21:41 <andres__> they *look* the same
2014-11-05T16:21:53 <andres__> if you see the folders and the number of files within
2014-11-05T16:22:21 <Justin_o> andres__: are you looking at this tutorial? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/tutorial-gettingStartedWithInfusion/GettingStartedWithInfusion.md
2014-11-05T16:22:49 <andres__> currently at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/tutorial-gettingStartedWithInfusion/SetUpYourEnvironment.md
2014-11-05T16:25:36 <Justin_o> i believe those are the same
2014-11-05T16:25:43 <Justin_o> the paths you mentioned
2014-11-05T16:25:45 <Justin_o> andres__: ^
2014-11-05T16:28:48 <andres__> thanks Justin_o
2014-11-05T16:31:52 <andres__> let\'s see if i can do it by myself from here, bye :)

2014-11-05T17:01:25 <colinclark> michelled, kasparnet: Any thoughts?

2014-11-05T19:24:52 <Justin_o> anastasiac: is it necessary to fix this http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-2946
2014-11-05T19:25:04 <Justin_o> jessm: ^
2014-11-05T19:25:44 <anastasiac> oh, fer**sake, do we really care?

2014-11-05T19:26:30 <anastasiac> the icon linked to from the JIRA is an old icon, but I believe we have a new one
2014-11-05T19:27:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s true
2014-11-05T19:27:56 <anastasiac> The fix seems to require a direct file change on the file server, and a restarting of the application server, Justin_o

2014-11-05T19:34:55 <michelled> I would like to join
2014-11-05T19:35:08 <michelled> are we using vidyo, Justin_o ?

2014-11-05T19:35:24 <colinclark> shall we use the standup room in vidyo?
2014-11-05T19:35:24 <Justin_o> michelled: i guess it depends on who wants to join remotely
2014-11-05T19:35:41 <colinclark> what does it depend on?
2014-11-05T19:35:59 <Justin_o> if they have a vidyo account i guess
