As far as i know, the PGA scope is still in discussion and not settled yet. michelled and anastasiac, feel free to correct me. Is there any PGA works that jhung can start working on?

2014-12-01T18:22:17 <Bosmon7> Thank you for your JIRA update to GPII-1028 - it is very helpful
2014-12-01T18:22:18 <Bosmon7> I will respond soon
2014-12-01T18:24:18 <Bosmon7> simonjb - thanks so much for your latest updates to https://github.com/simonbates/gpii-oauth2/tree/master/gpii-oauth2-datastore
2014-12-01T18:25:20 <simonjb> Bosmon7: when you have some time, it would be great to talk with you about the changes
2014-12-01T18:25:54 <Bosmon7> I think it is looking good - I think, as we discussed earlier, you can i) remove the initial "modelisation" of the implementation since I don\'t think the ChangeApplier adds much value at this particular abstraction boundary, and ii) could you convert the tests to browser-based tests too (as we discussed on Friday, this involves replacing the dependence on lodash and util with the equivalent
2014-12-01T18:25:54 <Bosmon7> Fluid.js utilities
2014-12-01T18:26:08 <Bosmon7> I\'m on a train now so voice chat will be tough, but I\'m happy to chat here for a while
2014-12-01T18:28:04 <simonjb> Bosmon7: would you be able to chat by voice when you are back in Cambridge? I am currently working on the integrator docs and am not blocked
2014-12-01T18:28:15 <Bosmon7> ok sure
2014-12-01T18:28:29 <Bosmon7> I should be in at about 3pm your time
2014-12-01T18:28:34 <simonjb> Bosmon7: awesome

2014-12-01T20:40:37 <Bosmon2> Hi there cindyli!
2014-12-01T20:41:22 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon2, i left a couple of comments for model transformation pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/572
2014-12-01T20:42:04 <cindyli> another thing is, i\'m starting working on this jira - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5568
2014-12-01T20:42:46 <cindyli> i\'m thinking to do something similar for uiEnhancer in terms of loading templates and messages
2014-12-01T20:43:10 <cindyli> 1. create a resourcesLoader that has 2 sub-components "messageLoader" and "templateLoader"
2014-12-01T20:43:25 <cindyli> 2. add it into uiEnhancer
2014-12-01T20:43:40 <cindyli> what do you think about this approach?
2014-12-01T20:44:11 <cindyli> "something similar as what we did for prefsEditor"
2014-12-01T20:45:34 * clown joined the channel
2014-12-01T20:46:20 <Bosmon2> cindyli - do you think you could add to the FLUID-5568 description a little "sketch" showing the containment relationship of the components that it mentions? It will be very helpful for people reading the issue
2014-12-01T20:47:11 <Bosmon2> cindyli - is it possible to reuse the resourcesLoader that we already wrote?
2014-12-01T20:47:32 <Bosmon2> Hi there simonjb - I am back now
2014-12-01T20:47:34 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2014-12-01T20:48:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: were you able to chat now?
2014-12-01T20:50:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2014-12-01T20:50:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: yes, i will update the jira. what we already wrote is "resourceLoader" (without the "s"). both templateLoader and messageLoader are instances of it
2014-12-01T20:51:02 <cindyli> the new-with-s resourcesLoader is a wrapper component for having both templateLoader and messageLoader
2014-12-01T20:51:06 <simonjb> Bosmon: great -- Skype or Vidyo?
2014-12-01T20:51:55 * michelled has quit
2014-12-01T20:52:21 <cindyli> maybe we should find a better name than a confusing "resourcesLoader".
2014-12-01T20:52:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I think having both "resourceLoader" and "resourcesLoader" is undesirable
2014-12-01T20:53:08 <Bosmon> simonjb - I\'ll call up your ..... "ROOM"....
2014-12-01T20:53:19 <simonjb> Bosmon: :)

2014-12-01T21:27:56 * scott_gonzalez_ joined the channel
2014-12-01T21:28:10 <colinclark> I have some ideas for next steps and would like to talk them through it with you enough that you might be able to try hacking up a wireframe or (even better) a prototype in the sim
2014-12-01T21:33:04 <jhung> colinclark: this is good timing because I was just given a link to the latest version of the sim w keyboard accessibility. They would like some feedback.
2014-12-01T21:33:21 <colinclark> I\'m travelling for most of tomorrow
2014-12-01T21:33:24 <jhung> I\'m in the office tomorrow colinclark if you want to chat then.
2014-12-01T21:33:31 <colinclark> won\'t have much time to talk until after 5 pm EST
2014-12-01T21:33:48 <colinclark> Madison\'s not far away but connections always make travel slower :(
2014-12-01T21:34:01 <colinclark> I have meetings all day on Wednesday and Thursday, and then more flying on Friday
2014-12-01T21:34:25 <colinclark> Probably the best time to talk might be when I get to the airport tomorrow, assuming I get there on time :)
2014-12-01T21:34:47 <jhung> colinclark: ok. Approx what time will that be?
