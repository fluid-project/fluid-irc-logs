2014-03-27T12:53:55 <amilchev> key kasparnet, just tried out PCP/PMT with the new updates (win7) - did the contrast work for you? Cause no matter what I select (on/off or theme), nothing changes with the contrast
2014-03-27T12:54:51 <amilchev> kasparnet: contrast on/off was working fine before so it seems strange
2014-03-27T12:59:46 <kasparnet> amilchev: hmm... not sure if I tried the high contrast setting out
2014-03-27T12:59:59 <kasparnet> got meetings now and 3 hours onward, but will check afterward
2014-03-27T13:00:26 <amilchev> kasparnet: oh, sorry for bothering then..
2014-03-27T13:00:44 <kasparnet> no worries at all amilchev

2014-03-27T13:39:54 <cindyli> jhung, populating a pre-defined oer content into the metadata demo editing area is done. we can integrate it into your new design when your UI part is ready. what do you think
2014-03-27T13:40:00 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-03-27T13:40:46 <jhung> that\'s awesome cindyli. I am in the process of getting an email out to list regarding the new design. Hopefully we can get started on the new iteration very soon (maybe tomorrow or Monday?).
2014-03-27T13:42:06 <cindyli> sounds good, jhung, just so you know, my branch for this piece of work: https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/tree/FLOE-177
2014-03-27T13:44:19 <jhung> thanks cindyli. I\'m guessing we will need a jira for implementing the new demo design.
2014-03-27T13:45:29 <cindyli> jhung: what about modifying FLOE-177 for the implemetation?
2014-03-27T13:46:16 <cindyli> since FLOE-177 doesn\'t include the method to trigger the population of a pre-defined OER yet, jhung
2014-03-27T13:48:41 * anastasiac joined the channel
2014-03-27T13:49:18 <jhung> cindyli whatever you think is best. I\'ll be filing a separate Jira for the styling work associated with it though.
2014-03-27T13:49:50 <cindyli> cool, jhung

2014-03-27T14:32:05 <amilchev> hey Justin_o, can you tell me what cases should be tested for the gpiiStore component?
2014-03-27T14:33:22 <amilchev> Justin_o: for instance, calling "set" with no user logged in and checking whether the user has been stored in gpiiSession.options.loggedUser
2014-03-27T14:33:47 <amilchev> Justin_o: or should there be no reference to the gpiiSession component?
2014-03-27T14:34:22 <amilchev> on the whole, I can see what the gpiiStore is doing but not sure how to test it exactly
2014-03-27T14:36:12 <Justin_o> amilchev: i guess from a high level you\'ll probably want to mock out the ajax portions of the calls. You want to make sure that the data being sent to the server is correct. Also you should test that success and error conditions are handled properly
2014-03-27T14:36:17 <Justin_o> amilchev: does that make sense?
2014-03-27T14:36:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: you should probably also test the model transformations too
2014-03-27T14:46:55 <amilchev> Justin_o: so about the model transformations,  I guess I can manually create a model, apply the transform function on it and compare the result with manually creating the correct result
2014-03-27T14:47:23 <amilchev> manually created var with the correct result*
2014-03-27T14:47:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. that should be fine
2014-03-27T14:47:32 <Justin_o> amilchev: make sure you test in both directions
2014-03-27T14:47:53 <Justin_o> you can see there is an inverse transform as well
2014-03-27T14:48:55 <amilchev> Justin_o: you mean the same thing for this function as well? https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-663/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L129
2014-03-27T14:54:20 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes, basically you want to make sure you are at least testing all of the invokers https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-663/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L179-L196
2014-03-27T14:59:03 <amilchev> Justin_o: about testing the "get" invoker - should I manually log in sammy (for instance) in the gpiiSession component, then call the get invoker and compare the result with the (inverse) transformed model for sammy?
2014-03-27T15:01:02 <amilchev> by manually log in sammy I mean gpiiSession.options.loggedUser = "sammy" ..
2014-03-27T15:02:34 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m not entirely sure what you mean. I\'d suggest mocking the ajax calls like what is done in chris\' gpiiSession tests
2014-03-27T15:03:56 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-03-27T15:04:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: so I should never call get invoker, but rather simulate it with mockjax as in chris\' tests?
2014-03-27T15:04:41 <Justin_o> amilchev: no you should call the get invoker, it\'s just that the underlying ajax call is mocked out using mockjax
2014-03-27T15:05:12 <Justin_o> amilchev: you shouldn\'t have to change your invoker at all for this
2014-03-27T15:06:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you need things from gpiiSession, you might be able to create a simple replacement of it for your testing needs...
2014-03-27T15:07:06 <amilchev> Justin_o: so the two models to compare - the one produced by the get invoker and the one produced by simulating get with mockjax?
2014-03-27T15:10:09 <Justin_o> amilchev: um.. not sure i\'m following.. for writing the tests in general, you\'ll need to use mockjax to mock out the ajax calls (see chris\' gpiiSession tests for how to do this). Specifically you\'ll need to write tests for all of the invokers.. get, set and the model transformations
2014-03-27T15:10:13 <Justin_o> amilchev: does that help?
2014-03-27T15:10:53 <amilchev> Justin_o: yep i got the last thing, I guess I\'d better write some tests and then ask you "is this wanted?" :)

2014-03-27T17:17:41 <kasparnet> Justin_o: would you happen to know if there is something along the lines of an inverse of the $.extend functionality in the fluid framework
2014-03-27T17:18:17 <kasparnet> basically what I\'m looking for is a function that will "subtract" object A from object B, resulting in a new reduced object B1
2014-03-27T17:18:33 <kasparnet> so whichever path is present in both A and B would be removed

2014-03-27T18:21:53 <clown> I did it mostly to figure out how your draft DR worked.
2014-03-27T18:22:04 <clown> but, if it is useful, yay!!
2014-03-27T18:22:13 <jhernandez> yes, it is
2014-03-27T18:22:38 <jhernandez> haven\'t tried it yet, but it should work, yeah
2014-03-27T18:23:52 <clown> what do you mean "should"???  It works here fine!
