b'2014-04-01T17:52:33 <Bosmon7> simonjb - super!
2014-04-01T17:52:47 <Bosmon7> Yes, the node-ffi upgrade could in theory be straightforward
2014-04-01T17:53:05 <Bosmon7> But we have only done this twice before, and one of those two times was quite bumpy
2014-04-01T17:53:05 <simonjb> I hoping so!
2014-04-01T17:53:17 <simonjb> ok, let\'s see...
2014-04-01T18:03:41 <simonjb> I\'m just creating the JIRA ticket now Bosmon7 - the node 0.10 issue is specific to Windows?
2014-04-01T18:09:08 <jhernandez> simonjb: maybe this one? http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-94
2014-04-01T18:10:38 <simonjb> jhernandez: good find!
2014-04-01T18:11:41 <jhernandez> :)
2014-04-01T18:16:54 <jhernandez> Bosmon7: do you happen to have a few minutes?
2014-04-01T18:17:07 <jhernandez> (either now or later)
2014-04-01T18:18:39 <jhernandez> it\'s related to http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-413

2014-04-01T18:56:09 <simonjb> Bosmon7: quick check - to update node-ffi I build from source using node-gyp (https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation)
2014-04-01T18:56:28 <simonjb> and if it works, commit the compiled files?

2014-04-01T18:59:38 <simonjb> Bosmon ^
2014-04-01T19:17:39 <jhung> simonjb, Justin_o: the overviewPanel doesn\'t work in Safari. This is what the console says: TypeError: Attempted to assign to readonly property.
2014-04-01T19:17:40 <jhung> \t(anonymous function) (Fluid.js, line 1461)
2014-04-01T19:18:14 <colinclark> simonjb: That\xe2\x80\x99s my impression from our discussions in SD, yes
2014-04-01T19:18:34 <simonjb> thanks colinclark
2014-04-01T19:19:00 <simonjb> thanks jhung, will take a look
2014-04-01T19:19:23 <jhung> thanks simonjb. I\'ll continue testing. Let me know if you want be to file a jira.
2014-04-01T19:24:58 <simonjb> jhung: can you try locally removing "use strict" from Fluid.js:36 and see if that changes the Safari behaviour?
2014-04-01T19:25:14 <jhung> ok. I\'ll give that a try simonjb
2014-04-01T19:27:00 <jhung> simonjb: that seems to fix it.
2014-04-01T19:27:37 <simonjb> jhung: ok, can you please check and see if with "use strict" other components are broken in Safari?
2014-04-01T19:28:19 <jhung> ok. I\'ll so a check simonjb
2014-04-01T19:30:16 <jhung> yes it seems to break other components simonjb.
2014-04-01T19:30:28 <jhung> in safari
2014-04-01T19:31:11 <simonjb> ok, thanks, looks like the "use strict" is causing breakage in safari
2014-04-01T19:31:17 <simonjb> we will need to figure out why
2014-04-01T19:33:13 <jhung> simonjb: ok. I\'ll file a jira for this since it isn\'t exclusive to the overviewPanel.
2014-04-01T19:33:52 <simonjb> jhung: thanks - just chatting with Justin_o also (he\'s beside me) and he says can you make it a 1.5 blocker?
2014-04-01T19:34:15 <jhung> ok simonjb
2014-04-01T19:34:51 <simonjb> here\'s the commit that added the "use strict": https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/f7daa0cb99447a5098da511581eaf32316bbb104
2014-04-01T19:35:27 <jhung> thanks simonjb. I also found FLUID-5071 which I assume is related to that commit.
2014-04-01T19:36:41 <simonjb> jhung: other browsers are ok? the issue is just with Safari?
2014-04-01T19:37:12 <jhung> I haven\'t tested Windows yet, but Chrome and FF on Mac work fine.
2014-04-01T19:41:13 <jhung> simonjb, Justin_o: I created FLUID-5298. http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5298

2014-04-01T20:45:19 <Justin_o> jhung, simonjb: I\'ve added a comment to FLUID-5298. I\'ll be away tomorrow, could one of you alert Bosmon to the issue.
2014-04-01T20:46:21 <simonjb> Justin_o: will do
2014-04-01T20:46:41 <jhung> thanks Justin_o
2014-04-01T20:46:45 <Justin_o> thakns
2014-04-01T20:46:47 <Justin_o> thanks
2014-04-01T20:52:33 <simonjb> jhung: this is interesting - I just tested on a Mac here at IDRC and I don\'t see the issue - it\'s an older Safari: 5.1.7
2014-04-01T20:52:58 <simonjb> is the Safari version determined by OS version or is it updated independently?
2014-04-01T20:53:21 <jhung> Updated independently I think simonjb.
2014-04-01T20:53:31 <simonjb> jhung: you are seeing the issue on Safari 7, right?
2014-04-01T20:53:45 <simonjb> jhung: ok, thanks
2014-04-01T20:53:57 <jhung> yes. Safari 7.0.2
2014-04-01T20:54:09 * clown_mtg has quit
2014-04-01T20:56:03 <jhung> simonjb: I just finished doing testing across browsers and OSes. All looks good. I filed an additional Jira for FLUID-5299, but I think it\'s a minor issue at this point.
2014-04-01T20:58:05 <simonjb> ok, thanks jhung - so we are probably good to make the pull request?

2014-04-01T13:12:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m working on FLUID-5284 ( i have a couple branches for this in my repo ) I\'ll need your help with Reviewing these changes when I get them all in.

2014-04-01T13:34:32 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o - thanks for the bug report
2014-04-01T13:34:38 <Bosmon7> I have a fix for it at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/486
2014-04-01T13:34:50 * anvk joined the channel
2014-04-01T13:34:54 <Bosmon7> Looking forward to reviewing your linting fixes
2014-04-01T13:36:27 <Bosmon7> CodeClimate looks interesting but I fear its recommendations must be taken with a pinch of salt
2014-04-01T13:36:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: that\'s awesome thanks, i\'ll take a look at that pull request today.  And hope to have my linting one for you soon... It\'s going to come in two pulls so that you can see the jshint changes separate from the mountain of linting changes I\'m making
2014-04-01T13:36:49 <Bosmon7> For example its "complexity" complaints about FluidIoCTests.js (other than the linting issues) seem to stem mainly from the fact that the file is long
2014-04-01T13:37:09 <Bosmon7> It rightly complains that there is a duplicate test wrt. FluidJSTests.js but in fact this is deliberate as the comment above explains
2014-04-01T13:37:21 <Bosmon7> And after that, its primary complaint is about qunit.js which we can do little about : P
2014-04-01T13:39:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes... i\'m hoping there will be a way to do some filtering... it\'s good that you have a comment in the test file. Part of what i\'ve found in my jshint work is that there may be reasons for why something breaks convention, but they may not have been surfaced.. so it will be good to add comments for these reasons in the code where necessary ..
2014-04-01T13:39:49 <Bosmon7> I suspect it will tell us little that is helpful above what jshint can tell us itself ....
2014-04-01T13:40:08 <Justin_o> possibly, although jshint doesn\'t do much for code duplication
2014-04-01T13:40:48 <Justin_o> i think that will also be an extra level of analysis and it makes it more visible for others, so they don\'t have to run jshint on our code themselves for example
2014-04-01T13:44:11 <Bosmon7> Most of the code duplication warnings seem spurious - that is, it complains about fluid.defaults statements
2014-04-01T13:44:28 <Bosmon7> I guess, because it sees a function call with the same name with a large JSON structure as the 2nd argument
2014-04-01T13:44:33 <Bosmon7> I don\'t feel that the analysis is very nuanced : P
2014-04-01T13:45:05 <Bosmon7> And I believe that anyone who wants to run jshint on our code will use our grunt scripts?
2014-04-01T13:49:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: that\'s too bad :(
2014-04-01T13:49:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes they can use the grunt script, an installed version of jshint, the jshint site
2014-04-01T13:50:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: but code climate might provide a way for someone curious about it, or as a way for us to advertise how nice our code is
2014-04-01T13:50:54 <Justin_o> i\'m thinking of it more for the latter but if it has a bunch of unuseful reports for us, it may not be usable
2014-04-01T13:51:43 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i\'ll likely miss thursday\'s meeting as I need to go to a P4A workshop at the same time

2014-04-01T15:07:20 <simonjb> hey jhung, I think that the overviewPanel is good to go; would you be able to bring in the latest changes and do a bit of testing before we make the pull request? I\'m thinking maybe in particular with IE8 - thanks!
2014-04-01T15:08:16 <amilchev> Justin_o: pilots2 for universal
2014-04-01T15:10:59 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. anything else needed to be changed or did you just need to follow the pilots setup guid on the wiki?
2014-04-01T15:11:15 <Justin_o> amilchev: oh and did you do the setup on the 64 or 32 bit machine?
2014-04-01T15:13:05 <amilchev> Justin_o: 64 bit
2014-04-01T15:13:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: thanks.. we\'ll try to rebuild the instance we have here too
2014-04-01T15:14:29 <amilchev> Justin_o: I actually made one weird change - initially it didn\'t found node_modules/universal/gpii/configs/pilots2.json - the file was named pilot2.json - I just added \'s\' in the name and worked fine then
2014-04-01T15:14:47 <Justin_o> oh
2014-04-01T15:15:03 <Justin_o> amilchev: interesting.. you may want to surface that issue in a jira and let kasparnet know
2014-04-01T15:15:12 <Justin_o> when did that error come up for you?
2014-04-01T15:15:21 <Justin_o> during build or when running it?
2014-04-01T15:16:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: this was really weird, I\'m not sure I ran npm install exactly when needed, so I\'m gonna try it again
2014-04-01T15:16:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay, thanks, let me know
2014-04-01T15:17:13 <amilchev> Justin_o: that was when running (node gpii.js)
2014-04-01T15:17:31 <jhung> simonjb: thanks! I\'ll take a look at it this afternoon.

2014-04-01T16:01:36 <Bosmon8> Hi there simonjb
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> Justin_o: here\'s what I do:
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> clone windows repo
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> build.cmd
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> go to universal - git fetch origin - git checkout pilots2
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> delete node_modules/universal/node_modules folder
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> run \'npm install\' in universal
2014-04-01T16:01:47 <amilchev> go to windows - start.cmd opens node.js console and closes it immediately
2014-04-01T16:01:48 <amilchev> type \'node gpii.js\' to see the error - it can\'t find pilots2.json in gpii/configs, so I rename it manually and then start.cmd works fine
2014-04-01T16:01:49 <Bosmon8> colinclark mentioned that you might be working on some entirely awesome new documentation?
2014-04-01T16:02:28 * Bosmon7 has quit

2014-04-01T16:03:32 <simonjb> Bosmon8: yeah, I was thinking that I\'d like to write up some notes from my experience starting to use infusion and building a new component - a \'getting started\' guide
2014-04-01T16:03:43 <Bosmon8> simonjb - that would be fantastic
2014-04-01T16:03:48 <colinclark> it sure will
2014-04-01T16:04:30 <simonjb> Bosmon8: I have the experience of it recently and I have notes that I kept
2014-04-01T16:05:26 <simonjb> Bosmon8: it means delaying working on the debugger a little but I think it will be really good to have
2014-04-01T16:05:46 <Bosmon8> simonjb - absolutely
2014-04-01T16:06:48 <simonjb> Bosmon8: I will be needing your comments and corrections on what I write
2014-04-01T16:07:06 <Bosmon8> simonjb - very welcome
2014-04-01T16:07:16 <Bosmon8> I guess you will be forking the new repo that michelled just created, and writing in markdown?
2014-04-01T16:07:18 <simonjb> Bosmon8: awesome, thanks very much
2014-04-01T16:07:33 <simonjb> Bosmon8: yeah, that\'s the initial plan
2014-04-01T16:10:23 <cindyli> Bosmon8: i\'m using the conditional transform in the metadata demo for the model relay. as you know the conditional transform is not invertible yet. so, writing a new transform for its inversion. this is how the new tranform looks like: http://pastie.org/8986125
2014-04-01T16:10:29 <cindyli> does it make sense to you?

2014-04-01T16:12:03 <cindyli> the unit test that has all the model, the conditional rule, the inverted rule and the expected result: http://pastie.org/8986123
2014-04-01T16:12:32 <Bosmon8> cindyli - what is the meaning of "literalCondition"?
2014-04-01T16:12:59 <cindyli> to convert a literal value to true/false, Bosmon8
2014-04-01T16:13:35 <Bosmon8> Seems like a strange name to me
2014-04-01T16:13:39 <Bosmon8> Are all values not literal? : P
2014-04-01T16:14:19 <Bosmon8> What I feel is that the inverse transformation could possibly be computed by means of the existing transformation we have, the valueMapper
2014-04-01T16:14:30 <Bosmon8> Do you think you could explore that approach?
2014-04-01T16:14:39 <cindyli> ah ha. let me have a look
2014-04-01T16:14:51 <Bosmon8> That transform certainly needs more test cases and attention
2014-04-01T16:16:05 <cindyli> which transform? valueMapper?
2014-04-01T16:16:32 <Bosmon8> Yes, the valueMapper
2014-04-01T16:16:50 <Bosmon8> But I believe it should be powerful enough to invert the condition transform, perhaps with a little more work
2014-04-01T16:17:11 <Bosmon8> In theory, it is even capable of inverting its own action....
2014-04-01T16:17:55 <cindyli> good to know. reading it. will try
2014-04-01T16:18:09 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon8
2014-04-01T16:24:25 <cindyli> Bosmon8: works perfectly. thanks!
2014-04-01T16:25:09 <cindyli> hooking it up with the invertConfiguration for "fluid.transform.condition"

2014-04-01T17:46:30 <simonjb> hi kasparnet: I\'m just now looking again at updating GPII to work on nodejs 0.10 on Windows (sorry for the delay) - did anyone else create a JIRA ticket or look at updating since we talked about it last? or is it still outstanding?
2014-04-01T17:51:44 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I am quite certain it is still outstanding :)
2014-04-01T17:52:00 <simonjb> ok, thanks Bosmon7
2014-04-01T17:52:13 <simonjb> I\'ll make a JIRA ticket and take a look now
