2014-05-20T13:24:00 <Justin_o> jhung: are you still working on the FLOE-186 pull request?
2014-05-20T13:24:30 <jhung> Justin_o: give me a second to rewind my brain.
2014-05-20T13:25:09 <Justin_o> jhung: okay thanks.. i just pulled your branch down and am having issues with jQuery not being there.. i think this was because of the document in the iframe
2014-05-20T13:26:20 <jhung> ah.
2014-05-20T13:27:38 <jhung> Justin_o: I wonder if I forgot to commit it, or if I deleted it as part of that minimiaizing?
2014-05-20T13:28:14 <jhung> Justin_o: Looks like I didn't commit it. I'll push that up now.
2014-05-20T13:29:52 <jhung> Justin_o: done.
2014-05-20T13:30:07 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-05-20T13:33:23 <Justin_o> jhung: looks like all the file permissions changed to 755
2014-05-20T13:34:30 <jhung> Justin_o: it's supposed to be 655 right?

2014-05-20T15:06:12 <michelled> essentially just what we always do - go through and update the iteration plan page
2014-05-20T15:06:17 <jhung> michelled: ok.

2014-05-20T17:58:55 <simonjb> hi colinclark, would you have time for a (hopefully) quick question about licensing?
2014-05-20T18:03:09 <colinclark> hi
2014-05-20T18:03:13 <colinclark> sure, fire away
2014-05-20T18:04:09 <simonjb> I made a grunt config for infusion-docs to build locally for testing: https://github.com/simonbates/infusion-docs/blob/FLUID-5365/Gruntfile.js
2014-05-20T18:04:52 <simonjb> on the infusion gruntfile, we have copyright and license: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
2014-05-20T18:05:11 <simonjb> I didn't add those to my infusion-docs one
2014-05-20T18:06:03 <simonjb> question: are they necessary and if so, what license to use? CC as for infusion-docs/License.txt?
2014-05-20T18:06:11 <simonjb> thanks colinclark
2014-05-20T18:07:11 <colinclark> Code should be dual licensed ECL/BSD
2014-05-20T18:07:17 <colinclark> Documentation itself should be CC
2014-05-20T18:07:38 <simonjb> gruntfile == code?
2014-05-20T18:07:42 <colinclark> yup
2014-05-20T18:07:51 <simonjb> awesome, thanks
2014-05-20T18:08:08 <colinclark> You can use the exact same statement as the one for Infusion
2014-05-20T18:08:14 <simonjb> great, will do
2014-05-20T18:08:29 <colinclark> and the CC license in the License.txt file looks good to me
2014-05-20T18:08:46 <simonjb> cool
2014-05-20T18:09:26 <simonjb> how do we license code examples in docs? CC?
2014-05-20T18:21:08 <colinclark> that\xe2\x80\x99s  a good question

2014-05-20T18:49:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: for the https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org repo do we keep the master and gh-pages branches in sync?
2014-05-20T18:49:27 <Justin_o> i'm not sure why we use a master branch there i guess
2014-05-20T18:49:41 <Justin_o> and where to merge in changes
2014-05-20T18:57:35 <colinclark> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I have a particular opinion, Justin_o
2014-05-20T18:57:58 <colinclark> I have certainly kept master and gh-pages in sync when I made changes to the site with anastasiac
2014-05-20T18:58:18 <colinclark> but I don\xe2\x80\x99t really mind how we manage that
2014-05-20T18:59:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks. michelled just came in and basically said something similar.. i guess i'll wait till after we figure out what we will do with the static site generators and if this site will follow that before suggesting any changes
2014-05-20T19:06:58 <simonjb> Justin_o: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/6
