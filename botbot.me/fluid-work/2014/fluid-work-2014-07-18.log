2014-07-18T13:48:19 <Bosmon> VERNANDEZ - today we have SPANISH WEATHER
2014-07-18T13:48:30 <jhernandez> haha
2014-07-18T13:48:57 <jhernandez> same here in Brussels
2014-07-18T13:49:02 <jhernandez> 31\xc2\xba
2014-07-18T13:49:43 <jhernandez> btw, I won\'t be able to test your pull request until tuesday
2014-07-18T13:50:05 <Bosmon> What are you doing in BRUXELS?
2014-07-18T13:50:57 <jhernandez> actually, I\'m about to drive to holland
2014-07-18T13:50:59 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-18T13:51:40 <jhernandez> I\'ll spend the weekend there in Holland
2014-07-18T13:51:43 <Bosmon> Either way, the weather is horrible
2014-07-18T13:51:47 <jhernandez> visiting Amsterdam + beach
2014-07-18T13:51:51 <Bosmon> Yesterday was the hottest UK day of 2014
2014-07-18T13:51:52 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-18T13:51:54 <Bosmon> And today is much hotter
2014-07-18T13:51:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for creating the wiki page for the kettle notes
2014-07-18T13:52:00 <jhernandez> what is horrible to you?
2014-07-18T13:52:02 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-07-18T13:52:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - np
2014-07-18T13:53:18 <jhernandez> I\'m sure that Boulder\'s weather is worst - you should be used! :P
2014-07-18T13:54:44 <Bosmon> In Boulder I just stay indoors and close all the windows with the AC
2014-07-18T13:54:48 <Bosmon> In the UK I can\'t do this : P
2014-07-18T13:54:58 <jhernandez> oh
2014-07-18T13:55:02 <jhernandez> that\'s true
2014-07-18T13:55:17 <Bosmon> Thankfully by tomorrow it will be over
2014-07-18T13:55:37 <jhernandez> haha

2014-07-18T18:11:50 <cindyli> anastasiac: need your suggestions for feedback component names. in the wireframe, from page 5, clicking on the happy or sad face icons triggers the pop up of dialogs. any idea of the component names for those dialogs.
2014-07-18T18:12:28 <anastasiac> cindyli, having a look...
2014-07-18T18:12:33 <cindyli> we have two type: 1, happyPanel, since it\'s associated with the happy face icon. This may not be a good idea
2014-07-18T18:12:49 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac. 2. matchedPanel or unmatchedPanel
2014-07-18T18:13:06 <cindyli> btw, anastasiac, wireframe: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/37855787/metadata-feedback.pdf?api=v2
2014-07-18T18:13:11 <anastasiac> thanks :-)
2014-07-18T18:13:26 <cindyli> thank YOU!
2014-07-18T18:14:10 <anastasiac> I agree that "happyPanel" might not be the best choice :-)
2014-07-18T18:14:43 <cindyli> :)
2014-07-18T18:15:15 <anastasiac> ok, thinking out loud\xe2\x80\xa6 the first dialog is simply providing confirmation that the user\'s opinon has been registered...
2014-07-18T18:15:24 <anastasiac> the opinon is "this resource worked for me"...
2014-07-18T18:15:27 <anastasiac> hm...
2014-07-18T18:15:41 <anastasiac> "matchConfirmation"?
2014-07-18T18:16:04 <anastasiac> the second one could use the word "mismatch" somehow, to convey the relationship between the two
2014-07-18T18:16:14 <anastasiac> "mismatchFeedback"?
2014-07-18T18:16:26 <anastasiac> "mismatchInfo"?
2014-07-18T18:16:36 <cindyli> Justin_o: your opinion?
2014-07-18T18:16:51 <anastasiac> maybe "mismatchConfirmation" since confirmation is a part of the purpose of the dialog...
2014-07-18T18:17:12 <anastasiac> "mismatchDetails"?
2014-07-18T18:17:32 <cindyli> +1 on mismatchDetails
2014-07-18T18:17:45 <anastasiac> yeah, that\'s not bad
2014-07-18T18:18:04 <cindyli> Justin_o: let us know if you don\'t agree ;)
2014-07-18T18:18:21 <anastasiac> so how about "matchConfirmation" or "matchFeedback" for the happy one?
2014-07-18T18:19:17 <cindyli> umm.. no difference to me
2014-07-18T18:19:25 <cindyli> matchFeedback?
2014-07-18T18:20:35 <cindyli> let\'s do matchFeedback and mismatchDetails for now
2014-07-18T18:21:01 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-07-18T18:21:27 <Justin_o> cindyli and anastasiac sounds good to me. thanks

2014-07-18T19:00:32 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - Justin_o is testing out the build now
2014-07-18T19:23:02 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: in axe you didn\'t hear from Bosmon, the build worked in the test i ran.
2014-07-18T19:23:06 <Justin_o> in case
2014-07-18T19:23:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I am not used to all you guys being awake when I\'m working.
2014-07-18T19:24:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, that\'s good.  I don\'t think my error was a build error so much as a complex chain of dependencies that needed surgery.
2014-07-18T19:29:02 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ah i see.. did you manage to get it working?
2014-07-18T19:29:15 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the render works
2014-07-18T19:29:24 <the-t-in-rtf> moving on to events and listeners
2014-07-18T19:31:50 <colinclark> nice, the-t-in-rtf !
2014-07-18T19:32:25 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: that\'s great... hope those go smoothly
2014-07-18T19:32:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I am working from the star example, if that\'s up to date, should be good.
2014-07-18T19:33:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - another docs deficit we discovered with the-t-in-rtf - we seem to have nothing on the DOM Binder API in the docs repository
2014-07-18T19:35:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: really.. i thought we did, but maybe that was something else
2014-07-18T19:36:22 <colinclark> The DOM binder is a subtly cool feature
2014-07-18T19:36:26 <colinclark> nothing to make a big deal about
2014-07-18T19:36:32 <colinclark> but definitely worth documenting :)
2014-07-18T19:37:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/DOM+Binder
2014-07-18T19:37:11 <Justin_o> i guess it wasn\'t converted yet
2014-07-18T19:37:48 <cindyli> anastasiac and Justin_o, seems like i should have picked matchConfirmation instead of matchFeedback since we already have a feedback component for creating the entire top toolbar.
2014-07-18T19:38:06 <cindyli> changing to matchConfirmation, let me know if you have concern
2014-07-18T19:38:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds fine to me
2014-07-18T19:38:16 <anastasiac> cindyli, good point! better to change it
2014-07-18T19:38:20 * jessm has quit
2014-07-18T19:38:32 <cindyli> nice. thanks guys
2014-07-18T19:39:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think it wasn\'t converted because it is terrible
2014-07-18T19:39:58 <Bosmon> But we still need something there : P
2014-07-18T19:40:07 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure what its status was in our workflow
2014-07-18T19:45:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm... i guess we\'d need to check in with simonjb and anastasiac about that.
2014-07-18T19:46:09 * slim_ joined the channel
2014-07-18T19:48:58 <simonjb> Justin_o, Bosmon, anastasiac: right now the "DOM Binder" page is sitting in our "Missing pages linked from converted docs" section on http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation+Plan
2014-07-18T19:49:06 <Bosmon> Thanks simonjb
2014-07-18T19:51:54 <anastasiac> hm. Bosmon judged the DOM Binder docs page as "ok but reads confusingly" simonjb and Justin_o
2014-07-18T19:52:30 * anvk has quit
2014-07-18T19:52:38 <anastasiac> Bosmon, would you have any recommendations for how to improve it? Do you think it\'s bad enough that we shouldn\'t port it over without a re-write?
2014-07-18T19:53:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a page comparable to this but for ViewComponents? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/RendererComponents.md
2014-07-18T19:53:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I tried treeing up but didn\'t see it
2014-07-18T19:54:33 <anastasiac> the-t-in-rtf, try https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/tutorial-gettingStartedWithInfusion/ViewComponents.md
2014-07-18T19:54:56 <the-t-in-rtf> that lacks the detailed breakdown of the allowed options, the nice table.
2014-07-18T19:55:07 <anastasiac> ah
2014-07-18T19:56:13 <anastasiac> the-t-in-rtf, would this help? http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Component+Configuration+Options It covers everything, including view components
2014-07-18T19:56:24 <anastasiac> but specifically the options only
2014-07-18T19:56:46 <the-t-in-rtf> that is helpful
2014-07-18T19:56:57 <anastasiac> we\'re in the process of moving it over to the new docs space
