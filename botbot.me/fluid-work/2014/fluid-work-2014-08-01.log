2014-08-01T15:42:22 <Justin_o> avtar: if we wanted to add a plugin to jira, specifically this one https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-bitbucket-connector-plugin, is that something you'd have to do.
2014-08-01T15:49:29 <avtar> Justin_o: no, any of the admins for the fluid jira instance should have the appropriate privileges to install plugins
2014-08-01T15:51:32 <Justin_o> avtar: okay.. i'll look into it.. and try not to break things along the way
2014-08-01T15:53:48 <avtar> Justin_o: if it can wait till tuesday and also if you prefer i can perform the installation
2014-08-01T16:00:48 <Justin_o> avtar: i clicked the install button already.. i'll keep my fingers crossed for now.. it hasn't completed so it might still be downloading... not sure
2014-08-01T16:17:01 <Justin_o> avtar: i don't think the install is working it keeps restarting the download process
2014-08-01T16:26:20 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-08-01T16:41:22 <avtar> Justin_o: looks like there are log entries generated by the plugin
2014-08-01T16:43:36 <Justin_o> avtar: i left the admin area and came back.. it installed now.. i'll see if i can get it configured
2014-08-01T16:52:30 <colinclark> hey Justin_o and Bosmon
2014-08-01T16:52:32 <colinclark> you guys around?
2014-08-01T16:53:17 <Bosmon> Hey colinclark
2014-08-01T16:53:34 <colinclark> I was just reminded of a Grunt plugin I stumbled across late last night
2014-08-01T16:53:39 <colinclark> when I was looking again at NoFlo
2014-08-01T16:53:45 <colinclark> vulcanize, I think it's called
2014-08-01T16:53:59 <colinclark> If I understand it correctly, it will take an HTML file and rewrite its head
2014-08-01T16:54:07 <colinclark> replacing individual script tags with a concatenated build
2014-08-01T16:54:19 <colinclark> I think it's part of the Polymer toolkit
2014-08-01T16:54:31 <colinclark> I was very tired, so I may have misunderstood its purpose
2014-08-01T16:54:32 <colinclark> http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/concatenating-web-components.html
2014-08-01T16:54:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: that would be handy
2014-08-01T16:54:46 <colinclark> What is the status of our head rewriting code with the new Grunt scripts?
2014-08-01T16:54:57 <colinclark> Is that feature long dead, Justin_o?
2014-08-01T16:56:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: it didn't make it over
2014-08-01T16:56:39 <colinclark> perhaps this vulcanize actually does something else
2014-08-01T16:56:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: partly because it seemed like wanted something more robust anyways.
2014-08-01T16:56:46 <colinclark> inlining HTML for web components
2014-08-01T16:56:48 <colinclark> bummer
2014-08-01T16:56:55 <Justin_o> colinclark:  :(
2014-08-01T16:57:21 <colinclark> yeah, it looks like I misunderstood it
2014-08-01T16:57:28 <colinclark> it just inlines HTML templates for web components
2014-08-01T16:57:34 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: i think this lists the requirements we were loping for http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Grunt+based+build+scripts+planning#Gruntbasedbuildscriptsplanning-Requirements
2014-08-01T16:58:02 <colinclark> It occurred to me last night because I was testing my no-jquery build of Flocking with a few of my demos
2014-08-01T16:58:20 <colinclark> and it was really annoying to comment out the individual file imports and toss in a single script tag for the build instead
2014-08-01T16:58:30 <colinclark> it would cool to have some feature like this anyway
2014-08-01T16:58:37 <colinclark> if only for testing
2014-08-01T17:01:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: before it was only for testing purposes.. but i wasn't sure we wanted to put in the effort on something temporary
2014-08-01T17:22:47 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I added a couple of cleanup comments on https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/28

2014-08-01T17:47:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i'll try to take a look at that shortly.. i'll have to file a new pull request though
2014-08-01T18:00:12 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-01T18:17:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - a new pull?
2014-08-01T18:17:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, because that one was made by cindy
2014-08-01T18:17:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh, sure
2014-08-01T18:18:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i'm trying to fix up something for FLOE-207, but i'll take a look at the suggestion in your pull request comments after that
2014-08-01T18:19:03 <Bosmon> cheers

2014-08-01T19:24:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry, this FLOE-207 work is taking me longer than i thought and I'll be leaving in a few minutes.. I'll have to take a look at FLOE-194 when i'm back after the long weekend.
2014-08-01T19:24:41 <Bosmon> ok Justin_o, not to worry!
2014-08-01T19:24:59 <Bosmon> I could just fix it and push it myself if you think my comments seem reasonable
2014-08-01T19:25:24 <Bosmon> Since they are just minor matters of file packaging
2014-08-01T19:26:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i just looked over your latest comments they all do seem reasonable
