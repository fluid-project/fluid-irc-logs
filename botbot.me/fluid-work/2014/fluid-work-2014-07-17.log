2014-07-17T12:43:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s good.. i guess i was more wondering if it would be easier to build kettle on top of koa. It uses generators instead of callbacks. heres an article on some approaches to get around callbacks. I haven\'t had time yet to fully read through it, but hopefully it\'s helpful. again i don\'t know enough about any of this to have much of an opinion but
2014-07-17T12:43:37 <Justin_o> thought I\'d share with someone who does know :)

2014-07-17T19:04:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> @justin_o, has there been any more work on bowerizing infusion?
2014-07-17T19:04:56 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: not yet.. although colinclark and I talked about it in the channel a few days ago.
2014-07-17T19:07:04 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: it was on July 11 https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2014-07-11/?tz=America/Toronto
2014-07-17T19:09:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> Yes, found it before I saw your link\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2014-07-17T19:10:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> Sounded like a much longer discussion.  My question is simply how to manage the client-side dependency for now.
2014-07-17T19:10:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> I would rather not check in a copy of infusion unless that\'s what we have for now.
2014-07-17T19:11:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> (check it in to the repo for the UI I\'m building on top of express)
2014-07-17T19:11:22 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: there are a few issues that relate to building and modularization. 1) our build system currently has json dependency files that we\'ve added for both our own components and 3rd party dependencies. These have expectations that they are the directory of the module 2) we need to figure out how to maintain a modularization of our own components
2014-07-17T19:11:22 <Justin_o> within a bowerified world. 3) where to put the concatenated js files for bower to pull down. I don\'t think we really want to maintain it in our main repo. (this is from a discussion quite a while ago but i don\'t remember when exactly). maybe a separate repo.
2014-07-17T19:12:16 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: ah i see.. i don\'t think we really have an alternative at the moment. you can use our build system to make a minimum version of infusion though.. so it doesn\'t have to be everything.
2014-07-17T19:12:47 <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, will do that for now.
2014-07-17T19:12:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> thanks
2014-07-17T19:13:43 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf1: in case you were wondering the other conversation i mentioned above came from June 2 https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2014-06-02/?tz=America/Toronto
2014-07-17T19:14:09 <Justin_o> we should probably start a fluid-work mail thread on this at some point
2014-07-17T19:14:58 <Justin_o> cindyli1: i think my FLOE-198 pull request is ready for another round of review https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/27
2014-07-17T19:15:23 <cindyli1> thanks, Justin_o, will look at it soon
2014-07-17T19:15:23 * the-t-in-rtf1 is now known as the-t-in-rtf
2014-07-17T19:16:11 <Justin_o> vjoanna, danaayotte_, cindyli1: For the feedback tool demo i didn\'t fix that issue where the top bar warps and covers over the "display preferences" button and the header. I think we should probably just implement a responsive design to correct this issue since it only really happens at small screen sizes. I hope this is okay. What do you think?
2014-07-17T19:17:09 <cindyli1> +1 for responsive design
2014-07-17T19:20:21 <vjoanna> Justin_o: that works - but what would happen in extreme cases where someone has a lot of preferences on the toolbar?
2014-07-17T19:20:52 <Justin_o> hmm good question.. how many preferences could a user have?
2014-07-17T19:20:56 <Justin_o> vjoanna: ^
2014-07-17T19:22:18 <vjoanna> Justin_o: hmm, I think right now in the mockups someone could have a maximum of 10
2014-07-17T19:22:38 * michelled joined the channel
2014-07-17T19:22:57 <Justin_o> vjoanna: okay.. i\'ll play with it some more
2014-07-17T19:24:52 <vjoanna> Justin_o: But it might be okay if in those cases we use a different configuration, like in mobile width?
2014-07-17T19:26:12 <Justin_o> vjoanna: currently at the regular font size things are okay to 870px wide screen.
2014-07-17T19:27:38 <Justin_o> vjoanna: yes.. i think we should be able to do this. I guess the question would be when do you want to do the responsive design. If it\'s soon i think it\'s okay.. if not.. we may want to try to adjust things now.
2014-07-17T19:30:27 <Justin_o> cindyli1: i\'m going to head out now, can you check with vjoanna to see if there are any more changes needed for FLOE-198 for the wrapping.. maybe we could even file a new jira for it.. up to you guys though.
2014-07-17T19:30:48 <cindyli1> will do, Justin_o

2014-07-17T21:04:48 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone: It just occurred to me a useful trick for working with npm/git
2014-07-17T21:05:03 <Bosmon> One of the options listed on this page is https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-install.html
2014-07-17T21:05:11 <Bosmon> "npm install <git remote url>"
2014-07-17T21:05:26 <Bosmon> So this means that it is reasonably easy to update a single node dependency of a project
2014-07-17T21:05:48 <Bosmon> Simply cd into its "node_modules" directory, rm -rf the dependency, and then npm install it via its git url
2014-07-17T21:06:08 <Bosmon> This will do a shallow clone, creating an image which is the same as if it had been installed via top-level "npm install"
2014-07-17T21:12:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: handy
2014-07-17T21:12:31 <Bosmon> At this moment yzen will probably pipe up saying, "BUT THIS IS JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU FORTY YEARS AGO!!"

2014-07-17T21:16:17 <Bosmon> Hi simonjb - how\'s that "duplicate SPI API entry" scheme working out?
2014-07-17T21:16:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: https://github.com/simonbates/windows/commit/b3daaf9a8c5e098d45a5243b4bf6cee2bba9bfc3
2014-07-17T21:17:11 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'d like to chat with you about it -- would you have time tomorrow?
2014-07-17T21:17:16 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2014-07-17T21:17:21 <Bosmon> API entry looks good
2014-07-17T21:17:29 <Bosmon> Any oddities in use?
2014-07-17T21:18:14 <Bosmon> I guess you are running into that other issue, the general lack of genericity in our SPI settings handler : P
2014-07-17T21:18:31 <Bosmon> I had put some work into improving it but it seemed it was not worth it in the end
2014-07-17T21:18:34 <simonjb> Bosmon: the main concern I have at this point is the logic to select between the Ptr and Int versions
2014-07-17T21:18:49 <Bosmon> Since the set of SPI API calls is a very finite one
2014-07-17T21:18:49 <simonjb> line 90 in the new version
2014-07-17T21:18:51 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-07-17T21:19:09 <Bosmon> I think the general approach there is perfectly acceptable
2014-07-17T21:19:15 <simonjb> ok
2014-07-17T21:19:15 <Bosmon> Although do remember to always use === for comparisons : P
2014-07-17T21:19:36 <simonjb> sure, I can update to use ===
2014-07-17T21:21:09 <simonjb> Bosmon: is there a particular time that is best for you tomorrow? or shall I just ping you
2014-07-17T21:21:18 <Bosmon> simonjb - I\'ll be around all day
2014-07-17T21:21:53 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, great; I\'ll ping you at some point during tomorrow, thanks!
2014-07-17T21:22:54 <Bosmon> Probably better to fold the logic into spi.createPvParam though, where it appears we know everything about the type of this argument
2014-07-17T21:29:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: spi.createPvParam is used in getCurrentSettings -- the equivalent for applySettings is spi.getPvParam
