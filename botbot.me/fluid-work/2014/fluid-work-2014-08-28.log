2014-08-28T13:16:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I don't think he's really there, cindyli1
2014-08-28T13:16:48 <the-t-in-rtf> he mentioned being out this afternoon.

2014-08-28T14:58:11 <sgithens> hey fluid work
2014-08-28T14:58:49 <sgithens> so, what's the name of the CSS/UI effect right now, where you scroll down the page, and the entire horizontal space changes as you go down, so it's like a story board
2014-08-28T14:59:12 <sgithens> that is hip with the kids
2014-08-28T14:59:47 <sgithens> I wish I could remember one of the million sites that use it
2014-08-28T15:05:47 <jessm> sgithens: you mean parallax? http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/parallax-scrolling-1131762
2014-08-28T15:06:47 <sgithens> YES
2014-08-28T15:06:52 <sgithens> jessm : thanks
2014-08-28T15:07:02 <sgithens> I'm pretty sure that's what they all are that I'm thinking of
2014-08-28T15:07:24 <jessm> cool
2014-08-28T15:07:26 <sgithens> I kind of thought it might be a nice effect to apply to a workflow diagram
2014-08-28T15:07:57 <sgithens> like if you wanted to present the trace of flow through the architecture during the authentication and login process and how it works
2014-08-28T15:09:14 <sgithens> there might be another effect I'm thinking of too
2014-08-28T15:09:30 <sgithens> where in general the screen rotates and changes as you scroll down
2014-08-28T15:10:44 <sgithens> maybe it's all a modification of that technique
2014-08-28T15:11:09 <jessm> sgithens: i think we tried something like that once and found it too dizzying for the purpose
2014-08-28T15:15:43 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-08-28T15:16:04 <sgithens> jessm: hmm, do  you still have it up somewhere?
2014-08-28T15:16:58 <jessm> sgithens: hrm, lemme see if i can find it
2014-08-28T15:17:52 <sgithens> jessm: Hmm, monday is a holiday in Canada too right?
2014-08-28T15:18:05 <jessm> sgithens: yep
2014-08-28T15:18:24 <jessm> sgithens: just with an added \xe2\x80\x98u\xe2\x80\x99 :)
2014-08-28T15:19:05 * michelled has quit
2014-08-28T15:20:05 <jessm> sgithens: oh, i just found the thing \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a design actually, not a site and it has been split into different slides which changes the interaction. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have a site that does this.
2014-08-28T15:20:47 <jessm> sgithens: here\xe2\x80\x99s the design: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/38504533/pfei-slides.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1391122006576&api=v2
2014-08-28T15:21:13 <sgithens> those are beautiful slides
