2014-05-23T13:29:37 <amilchev> Justin_o: I recently arrived at the office, still don\'t know why the merge policy isn\'t applied
2014-05-23T13:31:21 * anvk joined the channel
2014-05-23T13:32:56 <amilchev> Justin_o: this is the grade I\'ve added to the whole thing https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-543/src/shared/schemas/js/pcpSchema.js#L36-L48
2014-05-23T13:34:30 <Justin_o> amilchev: it looks like that is there... and the merge policy is being added from what i can see.. can you try to switch your policy function to fluid.arrayConcatPolicy
2014-05-23T13:34:35 <Justin_o> and see if that makes a difference
2014-05-23T13:35:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: no difference unfortunately
2014-05-23T13:36:34 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. how about rather than adding it as a grade.. try adding the merge policy directly to the builder options and see if that works
2014-05-23T13:39:56 <amilchev> Justin_o: still same result.. by the way, how can I reference the object the builder creates? Just to check if the mergePolicy is indeed added..
2014-05-23T13:43:19 * jash4 joined the channel
2014-05-23T13:43:23 <amilchev> just referenced it...
2014-05-23T13:45:01 <Justin_o> amilchev: did you figure out how to get a reference?
2014-05-23T13:45:11 <amilchev> yes, i can see the mergePolicy grade being added
2014-05-23T13:45:15 <amilchev> Justin_o: ^
2014-05-23T13:45:58 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. can you see any conflicting merge policies?
2014-05-23T13:46:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: not sure if I can find the mergePolicy rule though ..
2014-05-23T13:46:31 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-05-23T13:47:14 <amilchev> Justin_o: where inside the object can I find any clue of mergePolicies at all?
2014-05-23T13:47:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: it\'s in the options object
2014-05-23T13:47:56 <Justin_o> amilchev: but the one you are looking for is in the options object of the builder itself
2014-05-23T13:48:46 <amilchev> yes, I got a reference to the builder object by adding finalinitFunction here https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-543/src/shared/adjusters/js/starter.js#L19-L25
2014-05-23T13:49:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: ^ and creating global var pointing to it - it has typeName:\xc2\xa0"fluid.prefs.builder", nickName:\xc2\xa0"builder"  ....
2014-05-23T13:50:03 <amilchev> Justin_o: I know I should be looking in the options object - there is no mergePolicy object in there.
2014-05-23T13:51:58 <Justin_o> amilchev: really.. that\'s surprising.. i think it should have at least had it\'s own
2014-05-23T13:54:46 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-05-23T13:55:22 <Justin_o> amilchev: i have retrieved a reference by a different means.. passed in a reference to the builder into the fluid.prefs.builder.parseAuxSchema function.. anyways, in the builder object there.. i see the options with a mergePolicy object
2014-05-23T14:01:00 <amilchev> Justin_o: ... I don\'t know how that happens, anyway, the policy still isn\'t applied though?
2014-05-23T14:01:13 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. i have something for you to try..
2014-05-23T14:01:21 <amilchev> ?
2014-05-23T14:01:50 * danaayotte has quit
2014-05-23T14:02:45 <Justin_o> amilchev: try changing your merge policy to this
2014-05-23T14:02:47 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/U8FYmGBz
2014-05-23T14:03:47 <Justin_o> amilchev: from what i can see, that should work
2014-05-23T14:04:12 <amilchev> Justin_o: yes!
2014-05-23T14:04:20 <amilchev> thanks
2014-05-23T14:04:49 <Justin_o> amilchev: no problem.. i guess the left hand side is a "path", we just didn\'t have too many examples of this type of structure.. usually it\'s only 1 level

2014-05-23T14:06:17 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeah, couldn\'t have known that .. I think I can finish it off from here :)
2014-05-23T14:06:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: awesome
2014-05-23T14:08:01 <Justin_o> simonjb: hello.. did you make a jira about moving the prefsFramework docs over to markdown?
2014-05-23T14:08:27 <simonjb> Justin_o: no, I didn\'t
2014-05-23T14:08:55 <simonjb> Justin_o: I can do that now

2014-05-23T14:29:36 <simonjb> Justin_o: the page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Working+With+A+Preferences+Editor+On+Your+Site has a note "This page has not yet been rewritten to reflect the recent refactoring of the Preferences Framework, but the principles and ideas are still entirely relevant."
2014-05-23T14:30:04 <simonjb> Justin_o: do you know if that is still correct: that this page is out of date?
2014-05-23T14:31:09 <Justin_o> simonjb: looks like it was updated a couple weeks ago.. i\'ll take a quick read through though
2014-05-23T14:31:31 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks, and if it is up to date, could you remove the note?
2014-05-23T14:31:38 <Justin_o> simonjb: sure
2014-05-23T14:37:56 <simonjb> Justin_o: what is the relationship between Preferences Editor and UIO?
2014-05-23T14:42:12 <Justin_o> simonjb: UIO is basically an instance of a Preferences Editor with some pre defined adjusters
2014-05-23T14:46:17 <simonjb> Justin_o: I\'m looking at http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Tutorial+-+Adding+a+Basic+Preferences+Editor+to+a+Site and see fluid.prefs.create() with gradeNames "fluid.prefs.auxSchema.starter" (last code block)
2014-05-23T14:46:31 <simonjb> Justin_o: is that something different from UIO?

2014-05-23T15:06:57 * jash4 has quit
2014-05-23T15:07:24 <Justin_o> simonjb: just skimmed through it.. i suppose you might get the same thing as UIO but the process of creating it is different
2014-05-23T15:08:01 <Justin_o> simonjb: so step 3 would be different
2014-05-23T15:08:49 <Justin_o> simonjb: so for UIO you would just instantiate fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor
2014-05-23T15:09:14 <Justin_o> simonjb: like this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/demos/uiOptions/index.html#L79
2014-05-23T15:14:09 <Justin_o> simonjb: i made some updates to the page and removed the banner http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Working+With+A+Preferences+Editor+On+Your+Site

2014-05-23T15:55:15 <Justin_o> simonjb: do you have a list of prefsFramework pages to move over?
2014-05-23T15:58:36 <simonjb> Justin_o: can we chat on skype?
