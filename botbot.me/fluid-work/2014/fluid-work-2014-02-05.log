2014-02-05T23:47:29 <colinclark> Bosmon: This is my Code Mirror component: http://pastie.org/8703061
2014-02-05T23:47:38 <colinclark> what should my mergePolicy look like?
2014-02-05T23:47:45 <colinclark> "members.editor"?
2014-02-05T23:47:59 <colinclark> "members.editor": "no merge"
2014-02-05T23:48:06 <Bosmon> colinclark - "nomerge" yes
2014-02-05T23:48:14 <colinclark> and the path is correct?
2014-02-05T23:48:30 <Bosmon> oh humm
2014-02-05T23:48:37 <colinclark> Also, what\'s your take on the two invokers?
2014-02-05T23:48:43 <Bosmon> You shouldn\'t actually need anything
2014-02-05T23:48:56 <colinclark> is this the appropriate manner by which I should fire an event after doing something programmatic?
2014-02-05T23:49:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: How come?
2014-02-05T23:49:14 <Bosmon> Well "because your intention is perfectly clear" : P
2014-02-05T23:49:19 <Bosmon> But the framework may still have a bug
2014-02-05T23:49:24 <Bosmon> Do let me know what the results are
2014-02-05T23:49:46 <Bosmon> And please add a comment on this JIRA
2014-02-05T23:49:47 <Bosmon> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5226
2014-02-05T23:50:00 <Bosmon> oh wow
2014-02-05T23:50:09 <Bosmon> There is even already a comment there suggesting this idea
2014-02-05T23:50:35 <Bosmon> It\'s even assigned to you :)
2014-02-05T23:51:19 <colinclark> So this issue is still saying I still need to be fearful on Node
2014-02-05T23:51:24 <colinclark> with my Sockets and Buffers and the like
2014-02-05T23:51:35 <colinclark> but you\'re saying that at least a "nomerge" should solve the issue there?
2014-02-05T23:51:45 <colinclark> and that I should be just fine here in the browser?
2014-02-05T23:52:11 <Bosmon> I don\'t think the browser is particularly different to node in this respect
2014-02-05T23:52:17 <colinclark> hmm
2014-02-05T23:52:21 <Bosmon> All of these are objects that are "only exotic by virtue of a nonstandard constructor"
2014-02-05T23:52:29 <colinclark> fascinating
2014-02-05T23:52:39 <colinclark> I\'m sure I had my buffers chewed quite recently
2014-02-05T23:52:44 <Bosmon> yes
2014-02-05T23:52:58 <Bosmon> You probablydid
2014-02-05T23:53:47 <colinclark> I\'m still confused
2014-02-05T23:54:06 <colinclark> I can attest to the fact that my CM appears to have survived its journey through the EXPANDER TUBES
2014-02-05T23:54:14 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-05T23:54:21 <Bosmon> Without any mergePolicy?
2014-02-05T23:54:23 <colinclark> yes
2014-02-05T23:54:38 <colinclark> I don\'t know if it survived by accident or intention, but it\'s showing coding
2014-02-05T23:54:39 <colinclark> code
2014-02-05T23:54:52 <colinclark> in a kind of unpleasant yellow, since this "code" is actually compliant JSON now
2014-02-05T23:55:00 <Bosmon> It\'s conceivable that the issue actually got fixed
2014-02-05T23:55:08 <colinclark> being loaded by JSON.parse instead of eval, no less
2014-02-05T23:55:09 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-05T23:55:13 <Bosmon> But I wouldn\'t bank on it until we gathered more evidence
2014-02-05T23:55:28 <colinclark> So on Node.js, I should be able at least to use a merge policy?
2014-02-05T23:55:42 <Bosmon> It\'s possible that a CM is just more resistant to chewing than a node primitive
2014-02-05T23:55:58 <colinclark> That\'s quite possible, yes
2014-02-05T23:56:00 <Bosmon> Marijn was always a careful kind of chap
2014-02-05T23:56:03 <colinclark> :)
2014-02-05T23:56:13 <colinclark> Okay, so next up in my parade of onCreates
2014-02-05T23:56:17 <Bosmon> And perhaps there are no "deceptive pseudoproperties" on a CM instance
2014-02-05T23:56:24 <colinclark> yes
2014-02-05T23:56:43 <colinclark> I have a "playButton," which needs to at some point in time register a "click" event with jQuery
2014-02-05T23:56:48 <colinclark> which I currently do in an onCreate listener
2014-02-05T23:56:48 <Bosmon> oh yes
2014-02-05T23:56:54 <Bosmon> Unfortunately we will need to leave that one
2014-02-05T23:56:56 <colinclark> point me the way to the 27th century
2014-02-05T23:56:57 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-05T23:57:11 <Bosmon> KINGG is pioneering the use of the "onDOMBind" event in the prefs editor
2014-02-05T23:57:18 <Bosmon> But so far this has not yet reached the mainstream
2014-02-05T23:58:27 <colinclark> fascinating
2014-02-05T23:58:31 <colinclark> ok, so before we move on
2014-02-05T23:58:42 <colinclark> the CM component
2014-02-05T23:58:50 <colinclark> with it\'s "setContent"/"getContent" pair
2014-02-05T23:59:09 <colinclark> is that the best way, in setContent, to do some stuff and then fire an event at the end of it?

2014-02-05T13:59:55 <Justin_o_> jhung, anastasiac: here are a couple of comparisons between foundation and bootstrap http://responsive.vermilion.com/compare.php and https://medium.com/frontend-and-beyond/8b3812c7007c
2014-02-05T14:00:08 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o_
2014-02-05T14:04:59 <jhung> thanks Justin_o_. I\'m liking Foundation so far. Dare I say, that perhaps I found it less painful to get running with?
2014-02-05T14:06:01 <Justin_o_> jhung: i like how that one article talks about how aptly they are named... for what they do.. which could explain why you\'ve been finding foundation easier with our highly customized designs
2014-02-05T14:09:09 <jhung> Justin_o_: yeah. Foundation doesn\'t use odd margins, paddings, or containers which makes building up a basic structure much easier. Bootstrap\'s grid + container is a nuisance often.
2014-02-05T14:19:45 <Justin_o_> jhung: good to have experience with both to know these things

2014-02-05T15:15:47 <amilchev1> hi, Justin_o_, kasparnet, could you tell me what\'s the current status of the PMT token generation in GPII/prefsEditors:master
2014-02-05T15:21:07 <amilchev1> Justin_o_, kasparnet: from what I tried today the token generation is OK, but adding "./io.json" to development.json in flowManager/configs stops PMT from generating a token, but when a user is logged in by http://localhost:8081/user/<token>/login and then PCP is opened by http://localhost:8003/pcp.html?<same token> (8003 is from the npm webserver), websockets do send preferences to the local flow manager (confirmed that with node-inspector)
2014-02-05T15:22:37 <Justin_o_> amilchev1: the token generation works in PMT because Chris commented out some code that was required by the web sockets in the ajax requests. I think chris commented on the jira about this. But that\'s about as far as I know on the state of things.. kasparnet might know more
2014-02-05T15:22:49 <amilchev1> Justin_o_, kasparnet: does token generation\'s success depend on xhrFields withCredentials: https://github.com/chrispetsos/prefsEditors/commit/25b03f7489a72f052a2cc20eb3167b672f11c3c2 ?
2014-02-05T15:23:20 <Justin_o_> amilchev1: that\'s my understanding
2014-02-05T15:23:22 <jhung> anastasiac: fyi I\'m updating the Infusion setup documentation to not reference the builder site anymore. I\'ll change it to reference github.
2014-02-05T15:24:15 <anastasiac> Thanks, jhung

2014-02-05T16:24:05 <jhung> anastasiac: I have found that much of our documentation refers to MyInfusion.js, which may not necessarily exist depending whether they downloaded Infusion using the old Builder or grabbed the source with github.
2014-02-05T16:24:51 <anastasiac> yeah, jhung, we should figure out what\'s most common, and use that, with a caveat
2014-02-05T16:27:43 <jhung> anastasiac: I figure MyInfusion since it\'s "easiest" and better suited for production.

2014-02-05T17:08:20 <clown> or "waiting", actually...

2014-02-05T17:17:52 <clown> kasparnet:  any news about the meeting?
2014-02-05T17:18:20 <clown> jhernandez:  how is the review of my code coming?  ( :-) I know the answer\xe2\x80\xa6)
2014-02-05T17:18:27 <jhernandez> haha
2014-02-05T17:18:32 <jhernandez> coming
2014-02-05T17:18:33 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-02-05T17:18:52 <jhernandez> sorry, I\'ve been bascially working on my papers for the hci
2014-02-05T17:19:05 <clown> well, I\'m enjoying the discussion on GPII-340 in the meantime.
2014-02-05T17:19:16 <jhernandez> did nothing code-related :/
2014-02-05T17:19:20 <jhernandez> heh
2014-02-05T17:19:49 <jhernandez> yes, I had a long conversation with Claudia on Skype

2014-02-05T17:21:53 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-02-05T17:22:51 <clown> Yes, she metioned a chat with you in her comment on the jira, jhernandez.
2014-02-05T17:24:22 <jhernandez> definetly, we should have a kiosk-topic oriented meeting
2014-02-05T17:24:57 <clown> sure.
2014-02-05T17:26:43 * clown thinks there is no arch meeting.
2014-02-05T17:26:54 * clown but is not entirely certain.
2014-02-05T17:27:12 <kasparnet> jhernandez, Bosmon, clown: wow - this is pretty fucking embarrasing
2014-02-05T17:27:22 <jhernandez> xDDDDDD
2014-02-05T17:27:23 <kasparnet> I forgot the meeting :O
2014-02-05T17:28:04 <clown> what is it that Bosmon says again.  Oh,  "damn you Kaspaaarnet".
2014-02-05T17:28:09 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-02-05T17:28:17 <Bosmon> DAMMNNN YOOOUUU, KASPPPAAAARNEEEETTT!
2014-02-05T17:28:19 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I\'m fine with "exceptionally" moving it to tomorrow
2014-02-05T17:28:21 <jhernandez> xDDDDDDDDDD
2014-02-05T17:28:37 <clown> I can\'t make it tomorrow.
2014-02-05T17:30:08 <kasparnet> colinclark, michelled: there is the arch meeting if you want
2014-02-05T17:37:15 * SonicX has quit

2014-02-05T17:56:49 <jhung> Justin_o_, michelled, anastasiac: do we have the JS dependencies for UIO documented anywhere?
2014-02-05T17:58:48 <anastasiac> jhung, I don\'t recall offhand. If you\'re looking for them and can\'t find them, they\'re probably not htere
2014-02-05T17:59:47 <Justin_o_> jhung: not directly.. you can see what modules it depends on though https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/preferencesDependencies.json
2014-02-05T18:01:00 <jhung> thanks Justin_o_ I\'ll try that.
2014-02-05T18:01:46 <jhung> anastasiac: so without a MyInfusion.js build, the alternative would be to document the dependencies by listing out each required file. Does this sound reasonable?
2014-02-05T18:02:06 <Justin_o_> jhung: you can all look at the includes on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/demos/uiOptions/html/uiOptions.html
2014-02-05T18:02:31 <anastasiac> jhung, I suppose that makes sense, though we\'re probably going to be recommending that people build their own bundles
2014-02-05T18:02:37 <anastasiac> but yes, we should document it
2014-02-05T18:03:35 <jhung> anastasiac: I wouldn\'t want to build my own bundle. :(
2014-02-05T18:03:42 <jhung> just sayin\'
2014-02-05T18:03:50 <anastasiac> yeah, we should document it
2014-02-05T18:04:01 <jhung> alrighty
2014-02-05T18:06:16 <anastasiac> Bosmon, do you have a minute for a question about fluid.progressiveCheckerForComponent?

2014-02-05T18:12:29 <colinclark> anastasiac: I\'m having trouble finding my way around our documentation
2014-02-05T18:12:46 <colinclark> I was sure there used to be a page that described the different types of components that can go into a renderer tree
2014-02-05T18:12:51 <colinclark> am I just missing it somewhere?
2014-02-05T18:13:12 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2014-02-05T18:13:35 <anastasiac> colinclark, do you mean this?http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/ProtoComponent+Types
2014-02-05T18:14:11 <colinclark> yup, that\'s the page
2014-02-05T18:14:15 <colinclark> I\'m probably doing something dumb
2014-02-05T18:14:17 <colinclark> but from this page: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Renderer
2014-02-05T18:14:28 <colinclark> I see that there is a blue "component trees" link
2014-02-05T18:14:31 <colinclark> but clicking on it does nothing
2014-02-05T18:14:39 <colinclark> presumably the page you have is somehow nested in it?
2014-02-05T18:14:53 <anastasiac> ah, that\'s something broken\xe2\x80\xa6 thanks for catching that, I\'ll look into it
2014-02-05T18:14:58 <anastasiac> that should expand
2014-02-05T18:15:36 <anastasiac> Bosmon, the VideoPlayer has two independent things it wants to check for. I\'ve put the two checks in the progressiveCheckerOptions.checks array, but in a browser that fails the first check, the second check never even happens!
2014-02-05T18:15:41 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-02-05T18:15:46 <anastasiac> Bosmon, how can I specify independent checks?
2014-02-05T18:18:43 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: i\'m looking to add build instructions for the grunt build scripts i\'m working on. Should i put those in the Readme, release notes, or a new file completely?
2014-02-05T18:19:45 <anastasiac> good question, Justin_o_. If you put them in a new file called "BuildInstructions.txt" or something similar, it would be pretty easy to find. But what\'s "typical"? Where would most people expect to find build instructions?
2014-02-05T18:19:55 <anastasiac> The readme is probably not a bad place, I suspect
2014-02-05T18:20:03 <anastasiac> it\'s probably a place most people would check
2014-02-05T18:20:09 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: i would agree with that
2014-02-05T18:20:20 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: okay.. i\'ll put it in the README
2014-02-05T18:20:22 <Justin_o_> thanks
2014-02-05T18:20:30 <Justin_o_> i\'m going to convert the README to markdown too
