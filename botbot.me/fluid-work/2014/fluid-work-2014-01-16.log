2014-01-16T15:24:19 <jhung> anastasiac: I was going to do some work on the Floe website. I was going to do the work in the dev site first, but I was wondering in the end how the changes get merged into the production site?
2014-01-16T15:25:03 <jhung> also I noticed the dev site is publicly visible - is that intentional?
2014-01-16T15:25:23 <anastasiac> that\'s a good question, jhung. I don\'t actually know the answer. I\'ve been involved in logging in and posting news items, articles, etc., but I\'ve not really worked on "the site" itself
2014-01-16T15:25:28 <anastasiac> I wonder if avtar or pat might know
2014-01-16T15:26:00 <jhung> thanks anastasiac. I\'ll poke around.

2014-01-16T16:01:59 <kasparnet> ping Bosmon, Bosmon7
2014-01-16T16:06:33 <michelled> hey, kasparnet
2014-01-16T16:06:35 <michelled> how\'s it going?
2014-01-16T16:07:09 <kasparnet> pretty decent -- dead-tired though, now that everything is over.. sitting in the airport waiting for my delayed fligth :)
2014-01-16T16:08:33 <kasparnet> michelled: I went through your mail (as you probably saw) and the review list in general, updating the status of everything I could sensibly update
2014-01-16T16:09:20 <kasparnet> and assigned all of them to pilots (as they are things that need get done for that)
2014-01-16T16:09:44 <kasparnet> michelled: looks like there are 81 JIRAs pending for pilots - which is currently planned to be carried out on Feb. 29
2014-01-16T16:11:55 <kasparnet> anyway - was just now looking at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5251 - to have something in case I couldn\'t sleep on the plane
2014-01-16T16:12:25 <kasparnet> but having some problems understanding exactly what antranig wants
2014-01-16T16:12:29 <michelled> kasparnet: yes, I saw your responses
2014-01-16T16:12:36 <michelled> thanks, for updating the JIRAs
2014-01-16T16:13:07 <michelled> kasparnet: when you are back at it, can you set up a meeting with Eleni to go through the final pilot scenario so we can make sure we\'ve got everything covered?
2014-01-16T16:13:16 <kasparnet> yupo
2014-01-16T16:13:20 <kasparnet> yup*
2014-01-16T16:13:33 <michelled> I kinda lik yupo, acutally
2014-01-16T16:13:43 <kasparnet> hehe
2014-01-16T16:14:15 <michelled> that JIRA is assigned to colinclark - maybe he has some ideas
2014-01-16T16:15:24 <michelled> kasparnet: shall we plan to meet on Monday morning?
2014-01-16T16:15:36 <kasparnet> yes, let\'s do that
2014-01-16T16:15:57 <michelled> cool, I\'ll look for you when I wake up
2014-01-16T16:16:04 <kasparnet> ok
2014-01-16T16:16:36 <kasparnet> I\'m booked 9-10 am your time, but other than that, I\'m pretty much free

2014-01-16T16:17:23 <kasparnet> michelled: thanks
2014-01-16T16:17:32 <kasparnet> is it beerdrinking night with yura?
2014-01-16T16:18:16 <kasparnet> michelled: if so could you toast with him from me cause he\'s awesome, and give him a kick in the balls cause he\'s leaving us?!
2014-01-16T16:18:25 <kasparnet> :D

2014-01-16T16:37:09 <michelled> hmmm, I might have to try them all out to figure out which ones are best
2014-01-16T16:37:36 <Justin_o_> i hope for yura\'s sake you don\'t have to many different pairs
2014-01-16T16:37:46 <michelled> 5
2014-01-16T16:38:08 <michelled> anastasiac, jhung: I added the four points about VP from the meeting we just had to the iteration page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2014-01-16T16:38:27 <michelled> please fix it up with the relevant info and JIRAs as you plan the work
2014-01-16T16:38:41 <michelled> next week, of course - after the yzen download has been completed

2014-01-16T20:43:12 <colinclark> that\'s the one I set up for the "slow" demo
2014-01-16T20:43:29 <colinclark> So you can see a few of the features yzen is referring to
2014-01-16T20:43:32 <colinclark> including "includes"
2014-01-16T20:43:47 <colinclark> and components named "server," which will override base configuration, etc.
