2014-01-22T17:46:54 <Justin_o_> cindyli: do you know for the auxiliary schema if we can pass in IoC references.. i\'m think that it\'s strange that we take in a class for the panel containers
2014-01-22T17:46:58 <Justin_o_> or maybe we have to
2014-01-22T17:48:29 <clown> jhernandez:  a quick followup regarding meeting \xe2\x80\x94 I\'ve got full day meetings for the rest of this week.  What does your schedule look like next week?
2014-01-22T17:48:36 <cindyli> Justin_o_: what kind of IoC references do you wanna pass in for panel containers in the aux schema?
2014-01-22T17:48:59 <Justin_o_> cindyli: like "{that}.dom.panelcontainer"
2014-01-22T17:50:02 <cindyli> Justin_o_: so this reference refers to selectors block for "that" component?
2014-01-22T17:50:22 <Justin_o_> yes.. well the parent i guess.
2014-01-22T17:50:27 <Justin_o_> parent of the panel that is
2014-01-22T17:50:47 <Justin_o_> i\'m not sure this all makes sense, just found it odd and worry about scoping issues if we just use the class
2014-01-22T17:50:48 <Justin_o_> directly
2014-01-22T17:50:58 <cindyli> if that\'s the case, the person who wrote the aux schema would need to have a good knowledge of underneath implementation
2014-01-22T17:51:15 * amilchev has left the channel
2014-01-22T17:51:30 <Justin_o_> cindyli: yes.. i suppose so
2014-01-22T17:51:50 <Justin_o_> sadly, or if we did something to ensure the scoping within the parent that would be better
2014-01-22T17:52:20 <cindyli> Justin_o_: i think the selectors defined in the aux schema are properly scoped based off the top container
2014-01-22T17:52:44 <Justin_o_> cindyli: are they? how are they scoped?

2014-01-22T17:54:59 <cindyli> Justin_o_: if you had a look on AuxBuilderTests.js, we have something like this in the assembled component -
2014-01-22T17:54:59 <cindyli> "fluid_prefs_panel_textSize": {
2014-01-22T17:55:00 <cindyli> "type": "fluid.prefs.panel.textSize",

2014-01-22T17:55:46 <cindyli> the selectors defined in the aux schema are extracted into the "selectors" block and referred for containers, Justin_o_

2014-01-22T17:56:50 <cindyli> cool, Justin_o_
2014-01-22T17:56:55 <clown> jhernandez:  11am my time.  Very good time for me.
2014-01-22T17:57:03 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i have another question for you..
2014-01-22T17:57:11 <clown> jhernandez:  I can do earlier if that is better for you...
2014-01-22T17:57:30 <Justin_o_> cindyli: do you remember if there were anythings in our GPII-226 branch that was used for review that we don\'t want in the repo
2014-01-22T17:57:53 <jhernandez> clown: nice, this time works for me too
2014-01-22T17:57:57 <jhernandez> :)
2014-01-22T17:59:32 <clown> Did you see the "apt under linux" in the planning document, jhernandez?

2014-01-22T18:01:13 <cindyli> Justin_o_: we had a separate demo "prefsEditor" folder in that branch, is that what we want? is the behavior of "go to pcp" button what we want? the communication btw PMT and PCT is using the strategy of passing token around in an url, is that acceptable? same as what we discussed this morning about launching PMT with a user token in the URL to view the settings of existing users? I don\'t have answers too\xe2\x80\xa6 :)

Was it a temporary thing for the demo a planned feature? do you have an idea?

2014-01-22T14:52:51 <Justin_o_> cindyli: we should probably ask colinclark, michelled, and kasparnet
2014-01-22T14:53:16 <colinclark> hi
2014-01-22T14:53:19 <colinclark> ask what?
2014-01-22T14:53:39 <cindyli> colinclark: what we should do with the PMT featuer that "allows an existing user token being passed into PMT as an url parameter\xe2\x80\x9d?
2014-01-22T14:53:46 <michelled> I think it was temporary for the review demos
2014-01-22T14:54:16 <colinclark> Well, it was and it wasn\'t
2014-01-22T14:54:20 <colinclark> I didn\'t fully understand Chris\' email
2014-01-22T14:54:34 <colinclark> but presumably we need some way for the PCP to actually work, right?
2014-01-22T14:54:35 * anvk joined the channel
2014-01-22T14:55:17 <cindyli> colinclark: yes, we do, but this PMT feature doesn\'t really help PCP to work
2014-01-22T14:55:40 <Justin_o_> colinclark: it\'s the one for pulling in the settings for a pre-existing user into PMT instead of creating a new one
2014-01-22T14:55:49 <colinclark> right
2014-01-22T14:55:59 <colinclark> sorry, PMT--I said PCP
2014-01-22T14:56:11 <colinclark> So, here\'s my question...
2014-01-22T14:56:35 <colinclark> should a user be able to key into the system with an existing RFID tag or USB stick, and then open up the PMT, and have it know who they are and let them edit their settings?
2014-01-22T14:57:20 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i think that was part of chris\' question. If we keep this around, should the PMT be logging that user in, or should it expect the user has already done this by some other means
2014-01-22T14:57:24 <Justin_o_> currently we support the latter
2014-01-22T14:58:37 <colinclark> Presumably we need to have the PMT "go the user in when they create a new account
2014-01-22T14:58:45 <colinclark> if the PMT is closed and then reopened
2014-01-22T14:59:02 <colinclark> or if a user logs themselves in, as they might well do every day, and then they open the PMT, clearly it\'s not the PMT\'s job to log the user in
2014-01-22T14:59:27 <colinclark> Am I understanding the issue correctly?
2014-01-22T14:59:49 <Justin_o_> Sorry, I have to run...
2014-01-22T15:00:36 <cindyli> yes, colinclark
2014-01-22T15:01:06 <colinclark> So it sounds like the PMT supports the first case now?
2014-01-22T15:01:14 <colinclark> That it can log the user in when they\'ve created a new account
2014-01-22T15:01:24 <cindyli> however, my question is, is our current way that passes the token around as an URL parameter a desired way by designers?
2014-01-22T15:02:04 <cindyli> or it\'s just a temporary thing for the review demo?
2014-01-22T15:02:44 <cindyli> if it\'s the latter, we probably wanna discard it to clean up the code since we are reviewing chris\' and alex\'s pull requests
2014-01-22T15:02:45 <colinclark> I can\'t really speak for her, but I can imagine danaayotte_ might not want to be put in a position where she has to decide on technical implementation details for us
2014-01-22T15:02:58 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-22T15:03:20 <cindyli> umm.. if this feature is considered a technical implementation, that\'s another story
2014-01-22T15:04:00 <colinclark> Maybe I\'m confused, but you seem to be asking about a technical issue here--"should the token be passed as a URL parameter"?
2014-01-22T15:04:16 <colinclark> danaayotte_: Is that the kind of question you want to be the expert on? ;)
2014-01-22T15:04:45 <colinclark> The functional question, I think, is "should a user be able to log themselves in using the normal means, and then open the PMT, and have the PMT know who they are?
2014-01-22T15:05:01 <colinclark> If I\'m understanding this at all :)
2014-01-22T15:05:38 <cindyli> haha, sorry if I\'ve confused you, colinclark. :)
2014-01-22T15:05:48 <colinclark> no worries, I\'m easily confused
2014-01-22T15:05:59 <cindyli> well, i don\'t think this is completely a technical issue
2014-01-22T15:06:19 <cindyli> since the user token is exposed in the url
2014-01-22T15:06:39 <cindyli> unless the url part would be invisible to end users someday in the future
2014-01-22T15:09:38 <danaayotte_> jhung: to answer your earlier question I was thinking that the checkboxes would appear once OK is selected

2014-01-22T15:12:07 * Bosmon has quit
2014-01-22T15:12:09 <colinclark> cindyli: The idea of our web sockets API on the flow manager is to create a bridge between web applications and local infrastructure
2014-01-22T15:12:37 <colinclark> So that, for example, a web application can query the local infrastructure and determine what the currently-logged in token is (if any)
2014-01-22T15:13:20 <cindyli> ok
2014-01-22T15:13:27 <colinclark> So, ultimately, any time the PMT is launched, it should use this means to determine the current token
2014-01-22T15:13:42 <colinclark> I guess my only worry about removing what we\'ve hacked in for the review is that it sounds like we\'ll lose functionality
2014-01-22T15:13:56 <colinclark> i.e. that a user won\'t be able to key in and then go change their preferences in the PMT
2014-01-22T15:14:01 <colinclark> is that correct?
2014-01-22T15:14:07 <cindyli> exactly, colinclark
2014-01-22T15:14:36 <cindyli> i wonder if we have a design on how this communication would be achieved, colinclark?
2014-01-22T15:14:53 <colinclark> What sort of design are you thinking of?
2014-01-22T15:15:04 <colinclark> just so I can understand
2014-01-22T15:15:18 <cindyli> like the design we have for pilot demos that PMT only creates new users
2014-01-22T15:15:33 <cindyli> do we have something similar for existing users?
2014-01-22T15:15:41 <colinclark> ah
2014-01-22T15:15:49 <colinclark> that\'s a great question for danaayotte_
2014-01-22T15:16:08 <danaayotte_> colinclark, cindyli: Trying to catch up on your discussion...
2014-01-22T15:16:14 <colinclark> sure, take your time
2014-01-22T15:16:22 <danaayotte_> I don\'t think I understand your question cinyli
2014-01-22T15:16:35 <danaayotte_> cindyli^
2014-01-22T15:16:55 <danaayotte_> which design are you referring to?
2014-01-22T15:17:08 <jhung> danaayotte_: I think the way that supplementary audio form is being presented, it looks like I should press OK again once I checked the checkboxes. What would it be like if we show the checkboxes by default and remove the OK button?

2014-01-22T15:18:52 <danaayotte_> by the way colinclark, perhaps one day I\'ll be able to answer those technical questions !! :)
2014-01-22T15:19:05 <danaayotte_> thanks cindyli
2014-01-22T15:19:11 <colinclark> feel free any time, danaayotte_ :)
2014-01-22T15:28:02 <danaayotte_> jhung: I\'m not sure about removing the OK button -- I think there needs to be a way of confirming the URL entry.  What if the OK button were greyed out until the user selects the text entry field again?  and if the user edits the URL I guess the checkboxes would be cleared.  hmmm
2014-01-22T15:28:34 <danaayotte_> it seems to be getting a bit too complex

2014-01-22T15:33:25 <jhung> Maybe a single OK after the checkboxes danaayotte_. This way it\'s a way of confirming the checkbox selections and the URL?
2014-01-22T15:33:40 <danaayotte_> ah I see

2014-01-22T15:38:17 <danaayotte_> cindyli: as I understand, passing the token is something that we want to happen in the back end.  Frames linked from this page show the desired login process http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PMT+advance+features+response+to+login+issues  By inserting USB or swiping RFID, some method of identifying the user (token or otherwise) is created

2014-01-22T15:40:22 <danaayotte_> vjoanna, please let me know if that isn\'t correct
2014-01-22T15:44:20 <cindyli> thanks, danaayotte_, now it seems how to pass the token around is a technical issue if it\'s supposed to happen in the back end and invisible to end users.
