2014-11-04T18:56:31 <jhung> anastasiac: I did some chatting about the build site. The consensus is that we should probably make it clear it\'s a different site. So it\'s not terribly important that the site navigation is different on build (i.e. non-existant).
2014-11-04T18:56:44 <anastasiac> ok, sounds good
2014-11-04T18:57:17 <jhung> anastasiac: the "nightly build" will be moved into the title, and the community links will be put back toward the top. Left column for demos, and right for tests.

2014-11-04T19:17:41 <slim_jim> Bosmon: who added the grunt stuff?
2014-11-04T19:18:49 <Bosmon> slim_jim - it was a joint effort between sgithens and me
2014-11-04T19:18:56 <colinclark> hey, slim_jim is still here
2014-11-04T19:19:02 <colinclark> perfect timing, since I have a question
2014-11-04T19:19:06 <colinclark> do you have a sec, slim_jim?
2014-11-04T19:19:12 <slim_jim> ok so I\'m following the install instructions for Win from clean
2014-11-04T19:19:17 <slim_jim> and running grunt fails
2014-11-04T19:19:24 <slim_jim> I guess it needs to be added to the path?
2014-11-04T19:19:34 <kasparnet> slim_jim: you need to install it first
2014-11-04T19:19:38 <kasparnet> I think
2014-11-04T19:19:47 <kasparnet> as in: npm install grunt-cli grunt
2014-11-04T19:19:50 <kasparnet> or something like that
2014-11-04T19:20:10 <slim_jim> kasparnet: is not listed as dependency but npm install --ignore-scripts=true  might install it?
2014-11-04T19:20:34 <kasparnet> not sure tbh.. it seems to be missing sometimes
2014-11-04T19:20:52 * anastasiac has quit
2014-11-04T19:20:57 <slim_jim> kasparnet: so what should I install?
2014-11-04T19:21:17 <slim_jim> is see grunt-legacy *was* installed
2014-11-04T19:21:19 <kasparnet> I *think* grunt and grunt-cli
2014-11-04T19:21:34 <slim_jim> kasparnet:  via npm?
2014-11-04T19:21:37 <kasparnet> yes
2014-11-04T19:21:58 <slim_jim> OK tah
2014-11-04T19:23:00 <slim_jim> hmm grun still not found - perhaps I installed npm incorrectly
2014-11-04T19:23:10 <slim_jim> colinclark: howdy doody
2014-11-04T19:23:13 <colinclark> hey!
2014-11-04T19:23:19 <slim_jim> you had a Q?
2014-11-04T19:23:22 <colinclark> So of course you know all about our meeting with Microsoft tomorrow
2014-11-04T19:23:30 <colinclark> since you\xe2\x80\x99re madly preparing for it
2014-11-04T19:23:42 <slim_jim> kasparnet: oh I forgot -g !
2014-11-04T19:24:22 <colinclark> Do you have your own personal list of issues we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced related to supporting Windows?
2014-11-04T19:24:36 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99d love to have a good list available to present to Rob Sinclair and co.
2014-11-04T19:24:59 <slim_jim> colinclark: you going to? great
2014-11-04T19:25:05 <colinclark> only remotely, sadly
2014-11-04T19:25:06 <Bosmon> slim_jim - as a possible specific instance of colinclark\'s question, I was wondering what kind of UI is exposed by your screen resolution app
2014-11-04T19:25:21 <slim_jim> colinclark: see Bosmon its cli
2014-11-04T19:25:24 <Bosmon> Does it kick into the 15 second "dead man\'s switch" or does it just change the screen res unilaterally
2014-11-04T19:25:55 <slim_jim> Bosmon: just changes - but only if the res you specify is one listed as supported but the display driver
2014-11-04T19:25:59 <slim_jim> *by
2014-11-04T19:26:11 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I guess that\'s pretty good
2014-11-04T19:26:23 <slim_jim> at some point we\'ll need to enumerate them for UI
2014-11-04T19:26:25 <Bosmon> Since the presence of the dead man\'s UI could be quite distracting, especially to a user requiring an AT
2014-11-04T19:26:33 <slim_jim> or perhasp pick closest
2014-11-04T19:26:57 <slim_jim> Bosmon: agree. It goes blank for a second - thats disturbing enough :)
2014-11-04T19:27:57 <colinclark> Are there other things we want to raise with them?
2014-11-04T19:28:12 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with simonjb, who I know had some questions when he was working through the test automation process
2014-11-04T19:29:23 <slim_jim> colinclark: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-841
2014-11-04T19:29:28 <slim_jim> this is a tracking bug
2014-11-04T19:29:45 <slim_jim> if simonjb has any new ones please get them added
2014-11-04T19:29:58 <colinclark> cool
2014-11-04T19:31:19 <simonjb> slim_jim, colinclark: the other big one I can think of is http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-12
2014-11-04T19:31:42 <slim_jim> simonjb: good one - yuck!
2014-11-04T19:32:46 <colinclark> oh cool, thanks simonjb
2014-11-04T19:33:27 <slim_jim> i linked that to 841
2014-11-04T19:34:05 <simonjb> slim_jim, colinclark: I added some comments on the bottom of that issue -- basically we need a good way to kill the magnifier process; I\'m not sure if the issue is limited to the magnifier or not
2014-11-04T19:34:18 <colinclark> cool
2014-11-04T19:34:21 <simonjb> you can start the magnifier as an unprivileged user, but not kill it
2014-11-04T19:35:26 <slim_jim> kasparnet: I cannot get grunt to run. any ideas?
2014-11-04T19:35:40 <slim_jim> if i install -g then cli cant find local grunt
2014-11-04T19:36:09 <kasparnet> slim_jim: hmmm.. I dont quite remember and I\'m a bit distracted at the moment
2014-11-04T19:36:34 <slim_jim> kasparnet: no problems - I will leave it. I was testing clean install
2014-11-04T19:38:01 <colinclark> can you make a pastie of the error you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, slim_jim?

2014-11-04T19:38:36 <slim_jim> colinclark: sure - I love pastie
2014-11-04T19:42:55 <slim_jim> colin so I installed grun non-global and gunt-cli global and it\'s building -
2014-11-04T19:42:59 <slim_jim> does that make sense?
2014-11-04T19:43:27 <slim_jim> colinclark: ^^
2014-11-04T19:44:31 <Bosmon> slim_jim - can you be a bit more clear :)
2014-11-04T19:44:44 <colinclark> it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to me entirely, but i\xe2\x80\x99m confused :)
2014-11-04T19:44:57 <slim_jim> npm install grunt
2014-11-04T19:45:03 <Bosmon> If you get the message "can\'t find local grunt" it means you have forgotten to run npm install on the local project

2014-11-04T20:10:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i want to use dynamic components to create the queues. how can i attach them to the correct spot.. can i get a reference back to the that, or do i have to pass something into the component for it to bind itself?
2014-11-04T20:12:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this is probably too lightweight a case for dynamic components - it would probably better to just queue the "components" as plain data structures
2014-11-04T20:13:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure what that means exactly
2014-11-04T20:13:39 <Bosmon> Just make a that = {} in the old style
2014-11-04T20:13:44 <Bosmon> Remember before we had a framework? : P
2014-11-04T20:13:52 <Justin_o> when was that :)
2014-11-04T20:13:57 <Bosmon> About 2008
2014-11-04T20:14:11 <Justin_o> that\'s about when i started.. :)
2014-11-04T20:14:44 <Justin_o> so i was thinking things would be like {directModelhash: queueComponent, directModelHash2: queueuComponent2}
2014-11-04T20:15:10 <Bosmon> yes
2014-11-04T20:21:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. good, but i shouldn\'t create those components as dynamicComponents
2014-11-04T20:21:48 <Justin_o> i should just manually create a component in place?
2014-11-04T20:28:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m suggesting you don\'t really create any kind of component
2014-11-04T20:28:22 <Bosmon> Just a data structure starting as {}
2014-11-04T20:28:43 <Justin_o> but what about the queueComponents?

2014-11-04T15:35:13 <jhung> anastasiac: I
2014-11-04T15:36:43 <jhung> \'m also looking at your comments in the build site.
2014-11-04T15:38:27 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look
2014-11-04T15:40:47 <jhung> Each page on the Fluid Project website is also a navigation item. If we put the same navigation on the build site, this would mean we should put the build site as a navigation item in the header. Is that desirable anastasiac? Do we want the build site up front in this way?
2014-11-04T15:42:13 <anastasiac> jhung, good question. Not sure. The mock-up for the build site shows the \xe2\x80\x9cprojects\xe2\x80\x9d link as \xe2\x80\x9ccurrent.\xe2\x80\x9d I was kind of assuming the build site was, conceptually, a part of the projects section of the site
2014-11-04T15:44:57 <jhung> anastasiac: the designs aren\'t 100% complete. There are inconsistencies.
2014-11-04T15:45:07 <anastasiac> yeah
2014-11-04T15:46:42 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ve always considered the build site as a separate beast. It\'s one of those things where we want it accessible, but not *that* accessible.
2014-11-04T15:47:10 <anastasiac> Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s always been separate in the past
2014-11-04T15:48:04 * danaayotte has quit
2014-11-04T15:50:50 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2014-11-04T15:51:33 <Justin_o> hi Bosmon, I was just talking over some of the details with cindyli
2014-11-04T15:52:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so first thing, i think the queue as an object won\'t completely work.. so i\'m planning to add a second one as well.. one queue will have the list of keys into the requests that have been made in the order they originally came in. The second queue will contain the hashes of the direct model as keys and have a queue of the individual requests.. this
2014-11-04T15:52:52 <Justin_o> will ensure that the requests are all serviced.
2014-11-04T15:53:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what do you mean by "the queue as an object" ?
2014-11-04T15:53:35 <Justin_o> { directModelHash1: [], direcModelHash2: []}
2014-11-04T15:53:37 <Justin_o> something like that
2014-11-04T15:53:57 <Justin_o> so i will still have that but also a queue that looks like this [directModelHash1, directModelHash2]
2014-11-04T15:54:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s a strange-looking structure
2014-11-04T15:54:20 <Justin_o> okay.. then i probably didn\'t understand what you were saying yesterday
2014-11-04T15:54:44 <Bosmon> Actually it is ok, sorry
2014-11-04T15:54:50 <Bosmon> I am confused after just sitting down :)
2014-11-04T15:54:53 <Justin_o> haha
2014-11-04T15:55:02 <Bosmon> So yes, why won\'t it work?
2014-11-04T15:55:29 <Justin_o> because as new requests come in i won\'t know which one to service next... so we could run into a case where a request is never handled
2014-11-04T15:56:23 <Justin_o> but i think having the second queue (array of the keys) should solve that
2014-11-04T15:56:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - but it is never "you" servicing requests
2014-11-04T15:56:35 <Bosmon> The action of servicing a request in the future is always scheduled by the queue
2014-11-04T15:56:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: at some point i have to trigger it to start
2014-11-04T15:56:56 <Justin_o> ah
2014-11-04T15:57:02 <Bosmon> And it doesn\'t do this by queuing it - what happens is that it (most likely) issues some kind of setTimeout which comes back to inspect the queue in the future
2014-11-04T15:57:04 <Justin_o> right... each queue could happen concurrently
2014-11-04T15:57:15 <Bosmon> So I don\'t see that a 2nd data structure is necessary
2014-11-04T15:57:29 <Bosmon> Not unless you are planning to use it to implement your own new hyper-efficient replacement for setTimeout : P
2014-11-04T15:57:33 <Bosmon> I mean, people have done this
2014-11-04T15:57:38 <Bosmon> But it doesn\'t seem called-for at present
2014-11-04T15:57:52 <Justin_o> i\'d rather not reimplement that :)
2014-11-04T15:58:00 <Justin_o> but not sure what you mean by using setTimeout
2014-11-04T15:58:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, let\'s look at a sketch of how your "debouncing" queue wrapper works
2014-11-04T15:58:31 <Justin_o> okay
2014-11-04T15:58:36 <Bosmon> Or indeed any wrapper
2014-11-04T15:58:49 <Bosmon> There seem to be two main schemes it can use, when a request is incoming
2014-11-04T15:59:44 <Bosmon> It can either i) forward it immediately to the wrapped queue, or ii) manipulate the queue that it has to indicate that it should be serviced in the future
2014-11-04T15:59:55 <Bosmon> Case i) is obviously very straightforward
2014-11-04T16:00:27 <Bosmon> In case ii) the queue naturally has to defer some action - probably because it has reached its concurrency limit
2014-11-04T16:00:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: following you so far
2014-11-04T16:01:00 <Bosmon> But in case ii) the queue itself (that is, the array keyed by the model hash) surely contains all the information it needs in order to decide what to do when the "future time" comes
2014-11-04T16:01:27 <Bosmon> And the queue, depending on its strategy, will either listen a) for the unsetting of the "isActive" flag, OR b) the expiry of some timeout
2014-11-04T16:01:54 <Bosmon> In both cases, when the "future time" arrives, it will simply look in its queue to see what is at the head of it
2014-11-04T16:02:03 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2014-11-04T16:02:15 * clown waves at lliskovoi
2014-11-04T16:05:05 <Bosmon> Anyway, this may have just confused things rather than clarifying them
2014-11-04T16:05:26 <Bosmon> But it seems to me that any work that the queue wrapper has "in progress" is represented either by a listener to "isActive" or by a listener to a setTimeout
2014-11-04T16:05:58 <Bosmon> We don\'t represent this declaratively in a data structure because there\' no effective way we can - not unless we mean to implement our own scheduler for a setTimeout implementation
2014-11-04T16:14:17 <jhung> anastasiac: There may be a problem with the fluid project styling. Don\'t bother reviewing it right now
2014-11-04T16:14:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - is this helping at all?
2014-11-04T16:14:34 <anastasiac> oh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the issue jhung?
2014-11-04T16:14:50 <anastasiac> ah, i see
2014-11-04T16:15:01 * slim_jim and I thought it was only us Brits who like to queue :)
2014-11-04T16:15:08 <jhung> yeah. the footer on the About page anastasiac
2014-11-04T16:15:15 <anastasiac> indeed :-)
2014-11-04T16:15:17 <anastasiac> okley
2014-11-04T16:15:18 * danaayotte joined the channel
2014-11-04T16:15:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry, was pulled away for a bit
2014-11-04T16:15:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so where is isActive set
2014-11-04T16:15:49 <Bosmon> !
2014-11-04T16:15:53 <Justin_o> wouldn\'t each queue need someway of determining it\'s active state
2014-11-04T16:15:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have seen you set isActive yourself repeatedly
2014-11-04T16:16:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2014-11-04T16:16:07 <Bosmon> Perhaps this is the source of the confusion
2014-11-04T16:16:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it was one global one before
2014-11-04T16:16:20 <Bosmon> The values in your hashed data structure are entire queue wrapping objects
2014-11-04T16:16:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. probably :)
2014-11-04T16:16:25 <Bosmon> Not just the request details
2014-11-04T16:16:42 <Bosmon> That is, every field of state you used to have in your wrapper component now goes into these queue objects
2014-11-04T16:16:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean that each queue is a component?
2014-11-04T16:17:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it may as well be - or you may like to make "lightweight" ones to avoid the details of constructing a full fluid component
2014-11-04T16:17:24 <Bosmon> But each one will effectively be a little "that", yes
2014-11-04T16:18:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. i think that\'s clearer
2014-11-04T16:18:23 <Justin_o> i\'m sure i\'ll have some more questions later though :)
2014-11-04T16:18:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure - I\'ll be here :)
2014-11-04T16:19:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-11-04T16:20:32 <Justin_o> did anyone notice if the log bot had stepped out for a bit
2014-11-04T16:20:40 <Justin_o> i don\'t seem to see some of our logs
2014-11-04T16:21:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t see that the log bot has been away today
2014-11-04T16:21:20 <Justin_o> oh it\'s there but just not when i try to bring up the exact date :(
2014-11-04T16:21:24 <slim_jim> Bosmant the rason upgrading nmp seems to fail is probably the order of node\'s npm and newly installed npm on the path

2014-11-04T16:22:25 <Bosmon> slim_jim - thanks
2014-11-04T16:22:40 <Bosmon> We should probably add a link to these notes on our GPII Windows wiki page
2014-11-04T16:23:08 <slim_jim> Bosmon: I simply delete d (well renamed) ...\

2014-11-04T16:26:08 <slim_jim> how do you tie together commits that affect files across universal and windows?
2014-11-04T16:26:19 <slim_jim> or don\'t you bother?
2014-11-04T16:26:48 <slim_jim> eg change a settings handler
2014-11-04T16:27:31 <slim_jim> cd ..

2014-11-04T17:29:01 <Bosmon> When you make your pull request, you should include a link to the matched pull request in universal that it depends on

'

b'2014-11-04T11:04:34 <kasparnet> I\'ve been using 32 bit and 0.8.26
2014-11-04T11:04:35 <slim_jim> just asking which version of node for GPII master it might fix that error
2014-11-04T11:04:36 <jhernandez> slim_jim: it\'s very very easy and helpful
2014-11-04T11:04:54 <jhernandez> slim_jim: I\'m using v0.10.30
2014-11-04T11:05:08 <slim_jim> jhernandez: OK
2014-11-04T11:05:16 <kasparnet> part of antranigs branch incorporates simons work - which should ensure that the latest version of node works
2014-11-04T11:05:37 <kasparnet> we\'ve been having some problems with recent node versions on windows
2014-11-04T11:05:54 <slim_jim> kasparnet: yes I\'d like to use that branch as also latest ffi - but merge conflicts are shown on the pull request :(
2014-11-04T11:05:56 <kasparnet> so 0.8.26 or thereabout would be the safest bet for now
2014-11-04T11:06:07 <jhernandez> slim_jim: "GPII-94: Update GPII to run on Node 0.10.29 on Windows"
2014-11-04T11:06:20 <kasparnet> slim_jim: but the branch isn\'t quite ready yet, I think
2014-11-04T11:06:28 <kasparnet> and significant changes has been made to the codebase
2014-11-04T11:06:37 <jhernandez> so you should merge that pull in to use a modern version of node
2014-11-04T11:06:39 <slim_jim> kasparnet: hense those conflicts
2014-11-04T11:06:58 <kasparnet> so in terms of gregg\'s box, using master would probably be the best option
2014-11-04T11:07:05 <kasparnet> for proper implementation of a settings handler
2014-11-04T11:07:19 <kasparnet> using Bosmon\'s version is prefereable
2014-11-04T11:07:33 <slim_jim> jhernandez: thanks - we really must install a bot to turn GPII-94 to a link - works great on moznet
2014-11-04T11:07:51 <slim_jim> kasparnet: but Bosmon\'s is not ready yet?
2014-11-04T11:08:11 <slim_jim> I can hold out on the proper handler - perhasp hack on it in Madrid during the boring meetings ;
2014-11-04T11:08:22 <kasparnet> slim_jim: I think it\'s more or less ready - but it hasn\'t been as heavily tested as master
2014-11-04T11:08:34 <slim_jim> OK, thanks
2014-11-04T11:08:44 <jhernandez> slim_jim: yeah, we definetely do that - the bot thing - we\'re using it on gimpnet aswell
2014-11-04T11:08:53 <kasparnet> I\'m really really hoping things will get in during the next couple of days
2014-11-04T11:09:02 <slim_jim> kasparnet: :)
2014-11-04T11:09:08 <kasparnet> jhernandez: should we do our skypecall in 5 mins?
2014-11-04T11:09:31 <slim_jim> thanks again guys
2014-11-04T11:09:41 <jhernandez> kasparnet: bien s\xc3\xbbr!
2014-11-04T11:25:34 <Bosmon> slim_jim, kasparnet - this all sounds very overcomplicated for what is just a throwaway demo
2014-11-04T11:25:49 <Bosmon> slim_jim - why not just add the configuration information as command-line arguments to your .exe ?
2014-11-04T11:25:58 <Bosmon> And you can just add one different solution per resolution setting
2014-11-04T11:26:22 <slim_jim> Bosmon: that is what I have done :)
2014-11-04T11:26:33 <slim_jim> but I thought we wanted a proper settings handler?
2014-11-04T11:26:45 <slim_jim> in the longer term?
2014-11-04T11:26:45 <Bosmon> Well sure, but not for tomorrow
2014-11-04T11:27:04 <Bosmon> If you can hold off perhaps for just 1 day, we\'ll have a reasonable branch for you to work from
2014-11-04T11:27:28 <Bosmon> I wouldn\'t try reinstalling the GPII which is on Gregg\'s box, especially if you want that to stay working at short notice
2014-11-04T11:27:38 <Bosmon> As you see, you\'ll run into numerous issues with node/npm versioning
2014-11-04T11:27:47 <slim_jim> Bosmon: http://pastie.org/9695003
2014-11-04T11:28:15 <slim_jim> Bosmon: thanks - I was just going to fact gather and then get Kasper involved - could be you
2014-11-04T11:28:44 <Bosmon> slim_jim - well the facts will all change in 2 days
2014-11-04T11:29:11 <slim_jim> I have hit those version poblems with trying to install node-inspector and 0.8.6 :( Why does it install a version of NI that is too resent for the node - bah
2014-11-04T11:29:28 <Bosmon> If you want the current facts, sbates will wake up in about 2 hours and can remind us what the current tortuous requirements are
2014-11-04T11:29:39 <slim_jim> Bosmon: :) great - I had decided to hold out for your merge of latest ffi and node before I do a proper handler
2014-11-04T11:29:59 <Bosmon> But this is the main reason we have dropped absolutely all other work in an attempt to get the windows repository up to date again
2014-11-04T11:30:10 <Bosmon> Unfortunately even in this mode the work has taken nearly 3 months
2014-11-04T11:30:41 <slim_jim> Bosmon: ah - so lets push for CI and releases etc. I can help.
2014-11-04T11:30:53 <Bosmon> slim_jim - that would be great
2014-11-04T11:30:58 <Bosmon> sbates is also heavily involved in that work too
2014-11-04T11:31:10 <slim_jim> lets discuss in MAdrid?
2014-11-04T11:31:32 <Bosmon> I won\'t be going unfortunately, since there will still be so much core arch work to clean up
2014-11-04T11:31:39 <slim_jim> :(
2014-11-04T11:31:48 <Bosmon> Neither is sbates
2014-11-04T11:32:00 <slim_jim> :((
2014-11-04T11:32:01 <Bosmon> We\'ll just have to do it through the normal channels of arranging arch meetings
2014-11-04T11:32:26 <Bosmon> But sbates and avtar have been working on our CI infrastructure for at least 2 months
2014-11-04T11:32:40 <slim_jim> OK. SOunds like in a couple of weeks then as you busy now and Madrid after.
2014-11-04T11:32:40 <Bosmon> I\'m sure they\'d be very happy to have any help you could provide
2014-11-04T11:33:05 <slim_jim> Will try
2014-11-04T11:33:06 <Bosmon> I think they had run into a bit of a stumbling block with Windows licencing issues
2014-11-04T11:33:22 <slim_jim> Bosmon: grrr licences
2014-11-04T11:33:27 <Bosmon> But right now sbates has started to concentrate on our security infrastructure for a while
2014-11-04T11:33:45 <Bosmon> Since urgent though CI is, yet again it has become even more urgent to have some actual facilities in the framework : P
2014-11-04T11:33:59 <slim_jim> The otehr thing I\'d like to see is clearer loging - but release are more important
2014-11-04T11:34:32 <slim_jim> Bah who needs features?
2014-11-04T11:34:39 <Bosmon> The logs are certainly somewhat less confusion in our upcoming branch
2014-11-04T11:34:59 <slim_jim> great - quality not quantity :)
2014-11-04T11:35:08 <Bosmon> But if you have some particular activities you\'d like to see logged, or a particular format you\'d like to see, please do raise an issue
2014-11-04T11:35:11 <slim_jim> not really interested in Kettle
2014-11-04T11:35:21 <slim_jim> will do.
2014-11-04T11:35:39 <Bosmon> Our current logging is certainly "uninformed by feedback from users"
2014-11-04T11:35:52 <slim_jim> shame on them!
2014-11-04T11:35:58 <Bosmon> Things should start to improve a lot soon once we can reopen master again
2014-11-04T11:36:05 <Bosmon> Which we are getting extremely close to doing
2014-11-04T11:36:15 <Bosmon> colinclark will start some of the early review work today for the dependent code
2014-11-04T11:36:16 <slim_jim> OK, I\'ll let you get on then.....
2014-11-04T11:36:24 <slim_jim> yay!
2014-11-04T11:38:57 <Bosmon> slim_jim - to answer your earlier question, we\'ll be sticking to 32-bit versions of node on windows
2014-11-04T11:39:21 <Bosmon> 64-bit node will raise all kinds of annoying new forms of build problems, as well as giving us facilities we\'re not particularly interested in
2014-11-04T11:39:45 <slim_jim> Bosmon: thanks - I had a vague memory of that being the case
2014-11-04T11:40:01 <Bosmon> And to answer your other question, yes, you will need a newer npm and an older node currently
2014-11-04T11:40:33 <Bosmon> I currently have node version 0.8.6 and npm version 1.4.20
2014-11-04T11:40:56 <Bosmon> The awkwardness is that there has been sufficient drift in npm that not even "npm install npm" will succeed in upgrading it
2014-11-04T11:41:04 <Bosmon> So you\'ll need to find the appropriate version and install it manually
2014-11-04T11:41:28 <Bosmon> If we\'re lucky, all of these problems will be gone by next week
2014-11-04T11:41:51 <Bosmon> But there will be a huge "review bomb" to get through before then
2014-11-04T11:42:14 <Bosmon> Since between us, me and kasparnet have touched essentially every file in the system, and sometimes multiple times each
2014-11-04T11:42:33 <Bosmon> It would be great to have you involved in testing the new system too
2014-11-04T11:43:01 <Bosmon> Since unfortunately there\'s noone left in the arch team who would be capable of providing independent review, since the massive merge includes work from essentially everybody
2014-11-04T11:58:05 <slim_jim> Bosmon: thanks - so you think a newer npm will solve the problem with node-inspector? It\'s worth a try as I want to debug
2014-11-04T11:58:44 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I find I have further problems with node-inspector recently
2014-11-04T11:59:00 <slim_jim> uh oh -
2014-11-04T11:59:14 <Bosmon> For some reason I couldn\'t find I could get the most recent versions to run at all
2014-11-04T11:59:24 <Bosmon> And I\'m pretty sure I tried with more recent versions of node.js as well
2014-11-04T11:59:46 <slim_jim> will  let you know my outcome
2014-11-04T12:01:01 <Bosmon> I\'m currently running node-inspector 0.1.10
2014-11-04T12:01:08 <Bosmon> More recent versions I tried would just give me a blank page in Chrome
2014-11-04T12:01:47 <Bosmon> But to be honest I have gradually backed off from using debuggers with node.js - all my recent work in the last few months has been done by increasingly bespattering the codebase with logging statements : P
2014-11-04T12:02:04 <Bosmon> And after a while I am starting to think that this is a more productive method anyway
2014-11-04T12:02:31 <Bosmon> Since you get to see a whole sequence of events unfold in time, as well as being able to do "before and after" comparisons with a set of changes by comparing the log files
2014-11-04T12:02:34 <jhernandez> Bosmon: xDDD - this is how I do debugging
2014-11-04T12:02:35 <jhernandez> :P
2014-11-04T12:02:53 <Bosmon> There\'s a very helpful utility called "util.inspect" in the node libraries which is invaluable here
2014-11-04T12:03:25 <Bosmon> Since i) it doesn\'t seem to crash when it is fed obnoxious kinds of objects, and ii) it is capable of rendering far more detail in peculiar structures than you can get from JSON.stringify
2014-11-04T12:03:45 <slim_jim> Bosmon: jhernandez I think we started a dsicussion about good logging some time back. It\'s invalubale and can help on users machine where no debugging is available
2014-11-04T12:03:50 <Bosmon> For example last week I had to debug an issue relating to lots of structures which hold the value "undefined" as a property value - which are not valid considered as JSON objects
2014-11-04T12:04:02 <slim_jim> for asynch it is very useful - though can hde bugs due to race conditions
2014-11-04T12:04:23 <Bosmon> In the end I found util.inspect was the only scheme that would reliably render such objects
2014-11-04T12:04:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks for that tip, I have JSON.stringify partout!
2014-11-04T12:04:37 <jhernandez> xD
2014-11-04T12:04:40 <slim_jim> heh
2014-11-04T12:04:58 <Bosmon> Although I spent a while improving our fluid.prettyPrintJSON utility until I discovered util.inspect
2014-11-04T12:05:04 <Bosmon> VERNANNDDEZ
2014-11-04T12:05:13 <jhernandez> Bosmon: do you know if there\'s something similar to python\'s pdb for node
2014-11-04T12:05:14 <Bosmon> Have you become some kind of ***FFRENCCHHMAN***?
2014-11-04T12:05:27 <jhernandez> Bosmon: oui
2014-11-04T12:05:30 <jhernandez> :P
2014-11-04T12:05:46 <Bosmon> jhernandez - node-inspector is the only mainstream node debugger that I\'m aware of
2014-11-04T12:06:02 <Bosmon> And I\'ve sort of stopped using it recently
2014-11-04T12:06:26 <slim_jim> Bosmon: I have node 0.8.26 and npm 1.2.30 so I\'ll try rolling back and forward
2014-11-04T12:06:36 <Bosmon> slim_jim - as for async issues, here\'s another helpful tip - you can disturb the results of timings in such a system by redirecting the console output to a file
2014-11-04T12:06:42 <Bosmon> And comparing the results with seeing it on the console
2014-11-04T12:06:51 <Bosmon> If there is any difference, it is doubtless due to race conditions
2014-11-04T12:07:04 <Bosmon> Windows is particularly sensitive to this kind of thing due to the insane way it deals with console output
2014-11-04T12:07:18 <Bosmon> I dealt with a huge slew of bugs resulting from this during September
2014-11-04T12:07:30 <slim_jim> Bosmon: yes or even switch off and see if behavour changes -though doesn\'t help fix
2014-11-04T12:07:36 <Bosmon> slim_jim - npm 1.2.30 won\'t be good enough I think even to work with our current trunk
2014-11-04T12:07:46 <Bosmon> I remember this coming up at Crete
2014-11-04T12:08:11 <slim_jim> OK. What about node 0.8.26 - could it be OK?
2014-11-04T12:08:24 <Bosmon> slim_jim - it could be
2014-11-04T12:11:24 * kasparnet has quit
2014-11-04T12:11:52 <slim_jim> err - the npm releases don\'t go above 0.10.0 - huh? https://github.com/npm/npm-www/releases
2014-11-04T12:12:29 <slim_jim> forget - their web site took me to the wrong repo :(
2014-11-04T12:13:19 <Bosmon> slim_jim - the system as a whole will run with node 0.10, but any settings that involve the SpiSettingsHandler will fail
2014-11-04T12:13:52 <slim_jim> that\'s *npm* 0.10.0
2014-11-04T12:13:58 <Bosmon> oh sorry
2014-11-04T12:14:24 <Bosmon> Right you are
2014-11-04T12:16:04 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-11-04T12:27:47 <slim_jim> node-inspector at least installed using npm 1.4.20 - thanks
2014-11-04T12:28:50 <slim_jim> Bosmon: ^^
2014-11-04T12:36:42 <Bosmon> slim_jim - cool
2014-11-04T12:36:46 <Bosmon> But does it actually RUN? : P
2014-11-04T12:45:13 <kasparnet> Bosmon:
2014-11-04T12:45:17 <kasparnet> hey
2014-11-04T12:45:26 <kasparnet> I\'m still working on the update stuff
2014-11-04T12:45:33 <kasparnet> and getting an annoying error
2014-11-04T12:45:51 <kasparnet> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot call method \'disconnect\' of undefined
2014-11-04T12:45:53 <slim_jim> Bosmon: yes runnning - but I got to learn to use the debugger (which is running)
2014-11-04T12:45:55 <kasparnet> let me just find a line of code

2014-11-04T10:02:53 <kasparnet> slim_jim: pong
2014-11-04T10:03:49 <slim_jim> kasparnet: Can I have some help on adding a solution? it\'s a temp hack for display resolution
2014-11-04T10:04:01 <kasparnet> sure
2014-11-04T10:04:06 <slim_jim> I copied mouseTrailing and added to the installedSOlutions file but it\'s not being matched
2014-11-04T10:04:27 <slim_jim> when I log in
2014-11-04T10:04:34 <slim_jim> Have  Imissed somehting?
2014-11-04T10:04:58 <kasparnet> so the ID should match in the "installedSolutions.json" and "win32" file
2014-11-04T10:05:11 <slim_jim> ack
2014-11-04T10:05:14 <kasparnet> and the user should have a setting which would trigger a match for the resolution
2014-11-04T10:05:19 <slim_jim> ack
2014-11-04T10:05:20 <kasparnet> "resolution solution"
2014-11-04T10:05:27 * slim_jim checks last point
2014-11-04T10:05:42 <kasparnet> planets will have to be aligned
2014-11-04T10:05:44 <kasparnet> :)
2014-11-04T10:06:06 <kasparnet> so for the triggering - it\'s probably easiest to ensure that the NP set you\'re using has an application specific block of preferences
2014-11-04T10:06:16 <kasparnet> as that will currently always result in a match
2014-11-04T10:07:58 <slim_jim> so in prefs I added     "http://registry.gpii.org/applications/com.microsoft.windows.displaySettings": [{ }]
2014-11-04T10:08:08 <slim_jim> and last part matches in all 3 placs
2014-11-04T10:08:18 <slim_jim> not here are no settings as all done in lifecycle.
2014-11-04T10:08:21 <slim_jim> *note
2014-11-04T10:09:11 <slim_jim> Kaspar how do application specific if thats not it
2014-11-04T10:09:50 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-11-04T10:10:00 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ^^
2014-11-04T10:10:10 <kasparnet> slim_jim: hmm... good question
2014-11-04T10:10:18 <kasparnet> perhaps try to include a value: {}
2014-11-04T10:10:20 <kasparnet> like so:
2014-11-04T10:10:33 <kasparnet> "http://registry.gpii.org/applications/com.microsoft.windows.displaySettings": [{ "value": {}}]
2014-11-04T10:11:08 * slim_jim trys
2014-11-04T10:12:28 <slim_jim> kasparnet: no change - nothing in log about displaySettings but other item in prefs is matched
2014-11-04T10:12:38 <kasparnet> hmmm... odd
2014-11-04T10:12:50 <kasparnet> could you either upload to github or paste all output in pastie
2014-11-04T10:13:06 <kasparnet> slim_jim: sounds like you\'ve done everything right
2014-11-04T10:13:10 <slim_jim> pastie?
2014-11-04T10:13:26 <kasparnet> http://pastie.org/ :)
2014-11-04T10:13:44 <kasparnet> just somewhere on the interweb where you can drop stuff ... doesn\'t have to be pastie :)
2014-11-04T10:14:17 <slim_jim> I\'ll do that as I just realsied I forgot to work on a feature branch :(
2014-11-04T10:15:35 <kasparnet> ugh, I know that feeling
2014-11-04T10:15:52 <kasparnet> though if you haven\'t yet committed anything, it\'s still possible to create a new branch
2014-11-04T10:16:08 <kasparnet> ie: git checkout -b GPII-XYZ
2014-11-04T10:16:22 <kasparnet> should give you a branch without modifying the existing one
2014-11-04T10:16:36 <kasparnet> (up till the latest commit, that is)
2014-11-04T10:18:20 <slim_jim> kasparnet: yeah but I got move the diffs or you\'ll get loads of changes - I think
2014-11-04T10:18:37 <slim_jim> kasparnet: http://pastie.org/9695003
2014-11-04T10:19:26 <slim_jim> oh_ I seem *before* you commit
2014-11-04T10:20:16 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-11-04T10:20:23 <kasparnet> ok ... so not sure if this is it
2014-11-04T10:20:29 <kasparnet> but perhaps try adding a capabilities block
2014-11-04T10:21:25 <kasparnet> "capabilities":              "applications.com\\\\.microsoft\\\\.windows\\\\.displaySettings.id"
2014-11-04T10:21:25 <kasparnet> ],
2014-11-04T10:21:33 <kasparnet> in the solutions registry entry
2014-11-04T10:21:44 <kasparnet> I *think* I fixed this in my branch
2014-11-04T10:21:57 <kasparnet> but right now it might still be necessary
2014-11-04T10:24:20 <kasparnet> slim_jim: ^
2014-11-04T10:24:33 <slim_jim> kasparnet: just pasting - tah
2014-11-04T10:27:03 <slim_jim> kasparnet: result!
2014-11-04T10:27:15 <slim_jim> screen res changes and restores
2014-11-04T10:27:43 <slim_jim> kasparnet: so I send an update eto gregg
2014-11-04T10:27:58 <kasparnet> slim_jim: awesome!!!
2014-11-04T10:27:59 <slim_jim> speaking of whom - did you see his email?
2014-11-04T10:28:29 <slim_jim> trouble is no idea what he has installed on Surface
2014-11-04T10:30:27 <slim_jim> kasparnet: re gregg\'s email ^^
2014-11-04T10:31:10 <kasparnet> slim_jim: yeah - just looking at it now
2014-11-04T10:31:27 <slim_jim> cool
2014-11-04T10:31:46 <kasparnet> it\'s really not clear what he installed, no
2014-11-04T10:32:27 <kasparnet> also, I\'m not sure what "and install the new one with PRESENTER on it on the new one"
2014-11-04T10:32:31 <kasparnet> means
2014-11-04T10:33:08 <slim_jim> kasparnet: he wanter to crate a presenter prefs than runs at a low res so that would include my display resolution stuff
2014-11-04T10:33:25 <kasparnet> ah ok
2014-11-04T10:33:58 <slim_jim> not sure how updating win32.js solutions could break it - unless somehting change in format which Bosmon said not for ages
2014-11-04T10:34:18 <slim_jim> that seems to be what he is say - but not at all clear.
2014-11-04T10:34:27 <slim_jim> can we get in a call with him later today
2014-11-04T10:35:42 <slim_jim> I\'ll push my changes to my univiersal repository so you can merge if required
2014-11-04T10:36:04 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ^^ can you confirm I should base on master?
2014-11-04T10:36:53 <kasparnet> slim_jim: yeah, basing it on master seems to be the way to go
2014-11-04T10:37:05 <slim_jim> K
2014-11-04T10:37:09 <kasparnet> things will change somewhat when Antranig and I get our changes in
2014-11-04T10:37:16 <slim_jim> one more question
2014-11-04T10:37:27 <kasparnet> but we wont get it merged until our stuff gets in
2014-11-04T10:37:30 <kasparnet> as tests are broken
2014-11-04T10:37:38 <slim_jim> K
2014-11-04T10:37:41 <slim_jim> i\'m now going to make a real settings handler
2014-11-04T10:38:00 <slim_jim> but am confused by the new settings declarations - is there some docs?
2014-11-04T10:38:12 <slim_jim> :)
2014-11-04T10:38:16 <kasparnet> in terms of a call - I\'m quite swamped (already got a planned 6 hours of meetings today) - and have a ton of things to do outside of the meeting stuff
2014-11-04T10:38:51 <slim_jim> kasparnet: re call - OK I\'ll try to help, unless hens is around
2014-11-04T10:38:55 <kasparnet> I can do a _quick_ call - which isn\'t always to easiest to do with gregg :) .. alternatively, i he sets up a teamviewer instance on the device, we can look at it via that
2014-11-04T10:39:03 <slim_jim> LOL - i know!
2014-11-04T10:39:14 <slim_jim> good idea
2014-11-04T10:39:41 <slim_jim> So I\'ll make first contact and ping you if and when
2014-11-04T10:39:47 <kasparnet> slim_jim: no documentation on the new settingshandler stuff - but I think that in the end it mostly adheres to the old standard
2014-11-04T10:39:51 <kasparnet> of settingshandlers
2014-11-04T10:40:13 <kasparnet> slim_jim: awesome, thanks so much steve!
2014-11-04T10:40:28 <slim_jim> I guess ut\'s the transformations I never got up to speed on.
2014-11-04T10:40:59 <slim_jim> I\'m sure I can figure ;)
2014-11-04T10:41:27 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ps - one bonus Q - please remind me how to debug node - must be on wiki someplace
2014-11-04T10:41:52 <slim_jim> I can;t recall all the incantations
2014-11-04T10:43:12 <kasparnet> so you need to make sure you have node-inspector installed
2014-11-04T10:43:19 <kasparnet> (npm install -g node-inspector)
2014-11-04T10:43:30 <kasparnet> the you can start it like so: node-inspector
2014-11-04T10:43:47 <kasparnet> and run the system in debug mode like: node --debug gpii.js
2014-11-04T10:44:14 <kasparnet> ... if you\'re running tests there might be some conflicts wrt ports +  you want to break from the very start
2014-11-04T10:44:17 <kasparnet> so in that case:
2014-11-04T10:44:29 <kasparnet> node-inspector --web-por= 9871
2014-11-04T10:44:38 <kasparnet> and: node --debug-brk gpii.js
2014-11-04T10:44:56 <kasparnet> ... in both cases, once you have started node inspector as well as node in debug mode
2014-11-04T10:45:13 <slim_jim> great
2014-11-04T10:45:14 <kasparnet> you just need to open your browser to the url given by node-inspector
2014-11-04T10:45:37 <kasparnet> http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Debugging_using_Node_Inspector
2014-11-04T10:45:38 <slim_jim> kasparnet: dam I got node / npm version error but it seems to install
2014-11-04T10:46:17 <slim_jim> node 0.8.26 npm 1.2.30
2014-11-04T10:46:40 <slim_jim> should I upgrade one or other - I know there are issue with version s and GPII
2014-11-04T10:48:32 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ^ OMG - Error: No compatible version found: minimist@\'^0.1.0\'
2014-11-04T10:55:52 <slim_jim> node --version
2014-11-04T10:56:31 <jhernandez> slim_jim: I hit that problem some time ago
2014-11-04T10:56:51 <slim_jim> jhernandez: Yes I feel some more windows help coming on ! :-P
2014-11-04T10:57:05 <slim_jim> how did you solve it?
2014-11-04T10:58:21 <jhernandez> can\'t remember how I got it solved, but for some time now, in linux I\'ve been using nvm, so I can have multiple versions of node.js running at the same time in my box
2014-11-04T10:58:25 <jhernandez> https://github.com/creationix/nvm
2014-11-04T10:59:04 <slim_jim> jhernandez: cool. What version of node should I be using for GPII?
2014-11-04T10:59:06 <slim_jim> master
2014-11-04T10:59:08 <jhernandez> looks like there are a couple of alternatives for win users
2014-11-04T10:59:25 <jhernandez> using node master is not a good idea
2014-11-04T10:59:41 <jhernandez> I always use the latest release
2014-11-04T10:59:47 <slim_jim> jhernandez: no GPII master - wha tversion of node?
2014-11-04T11:00:18 <jhernandez> the latest release, or at least, one of them
2014-11-04T11:00:21 <jhernandez> (talking about node)
2014-11-04T11:00:36 <slim_jim> \'one of them\'? eek
2014-11-04T11:00:47 <jhernandez> one of the latest releases
2014-11-04T11:00:53 <jhernandez> "stable releases"
2014-11-04T11:01:03 <jhernandez> they\'re tagged as "0.x.x-release
2014-11-04T11:02:12 <jhernandez> BUT, as I\'ve already said, I use nvm so I can run different versions of node at the same time
2014-11-04T11:02:51 <slim_jim> BUT you need to know which one you are using?
2014-11-04T11:02:56 * kasparnet has quit
2014-11-04T11:02:58 <jhernandez> so you can run the gpii with the "x" version of node and node-inspector with the "y" version of node
2014-11-04T11:03:01 <slim_jim> dos nvm install them all for you
2014-11-04T11:03:06 <jhernandez> yeah
