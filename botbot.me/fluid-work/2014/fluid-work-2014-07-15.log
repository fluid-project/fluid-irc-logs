b'2014-07-15T17:51:09 <clown> Quoting:      // TODO:  This tests that tuxguitar is not installed, but it\'s not really
2014-07-15T17:51:10 <clown> // an error if it\'s there.  For now, manually remove tuxguitar
2014-07-15T17:51:10 <clown> // before running tests.
2014-07-15T17:51:27 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, we already have this comment
2014-07-15T17:51:58 <clown> do we need a statement output to the console?
2014-07-15T17:52:25 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'m worried that removing it will require user input \xe2\x80\x94 that dialog that asks for your password.
2014-07-15T17:52:36 <jhernandez> it would be great, but I\'m not sure how it could work
2014-07-15T17:52:37 <jhernandez> clown: yeah
2014-07-15T17:52:40 <jhernandez> :/
2014-07-15T17:52:40 * clown doesn\'t like that dialog either, btw.
2014-07-15T17:52:50 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-15T17:52:52 <jhernandez> me neither
2014-07-15T17:54:12 <jhernandez> ok, then ... conditional tests + statement output to the console? (we\'ve disabled these tests blablabla)
2014-07-15T17:54:13 <clown> Okay, I can make the tests conditional (run them only if the initial condition is present).
2014-07-15T17:54:30 <clown> right, and add a statement to the console.
2014-07-15T17:54:35 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-07-15T17:54:55 <jhernandez> merci beaucoup!
2014-07-15T17:55:01 <clown> *Then* I\'ll dive into packagekit itself and see if it has an unit tests that provide "mock packages".
2014-07-15T17:55:21 <clown> but, I\'m not optimistic.  Who knows?  Maybe I\'ll be surprised.
2014-07-15T17:55:34 <clown> pas de quoie (sp?)!
2014-07-15T17:55:54 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, that would be great, but I wouldn\'t spend a lot of time with it
2014-07-15T17:56:08 <clown> okay
2014-07-15T17:56:14 <clown> what would you spend a lot of time on?  :-)
2014-07-15T17:58:39 <clown> wow, that made you think, jhernandez :-)
2014-07-15T17:59:43 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-15T17:59:48 <jhernandez> sorry, was afk
2014-07-15T18:00:01 <jhernandez> and then, looking for packageKit\'s source code
2014-07-15T18:00:03 <jhernandez> https://gitorious.org/packagekit/packagekit/source/534d89b462612fa19fd7b8d6497cd56685d85838:data/tests
2014-07-15T18:00:21 <jhernandez> it\'s funny, there\'s a rpm package there
2014-07-15T18:00:22 <clown> so, you beat me?
2014-07-15T18:00:23 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-07-15T18:00:52 <jhernandez> I have to leave
2014-07-15T18:00:56 <jhernandez> (it\'s a pity)
2014-07-15T18:01:05 <clown> s\'ok.
2014-07-15T18:01:10 <clown> Have a great evening.
2014-07-15T18:01:19 <jhernandez> thanks clown
2014-07-15T18:01:20 <clown> I\'ll send a pull request.
2014-07-15T18:01:28 <jhernandez> cool!
2014-07-15T18:01:30 <clown> My pleasure, jhernandez.
2014-07-15T18:01:36 <jhernandez> nope
2014-07-15T18:01:41 <jhernandez> *My* pleasure!
2014-07-15T18:01:43 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-15T18:01:52 <clown> NO.  MINE ALL MINE>
2014-07-15T18:01:54 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-07-15T18:02:09 <clown> hey, I even capitalized the period.
2014-07-15T18:02:13 <jhernandez> see you tomorrow!
2014-07-15T18:02:13 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-07-15T18:02:18 <clown> bye.
2014-07-15T18:02:33 <clown> and, thanks colinclark for you input.
2014-07-15T18:02:36 <clown> *your
2014-07-15T18:03:20 <Justin_o> anastasiac: could you remind me what the issue with UIO and line-height is?
2014-07-15T18:04:08 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you mean the one where the UIO line-height setting doesn\'t work if the page\'s css sets line-height?
2014-07-15T18:06:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yep
2014-07-15T18:10:47 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think i\'ve got a work around for my issue
2014-07-15T18:11:01 <anastasiac> oh?
2014-07-15T18:12:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: a jira for the issue with valueMapper -> defaultOutputValue option is created - issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5473
2014-07-15T18:12:35 <colinclark> clown: I think your response on the JIRA is very cogent and well-described. Thanks!
2014-07-15T18:12:49 <cindyli> Bosmon: the pull request with a unit test for it: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/546
2014-07-15T18:13:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: in the feedback tool demo we have foundation which sets a default line height on <p>. I set the default line-height on the <body> and set <p> to inherit the line-height
2014-07-15T18:13:50 <clown> colinclark:  cool.
2014-07-15T18:13:59 <anastasiac> Justin_o, sounds interesting

2014-07-15T18:55:46 <michelled> made it easy because we are already hosting the git repo for the other demo ;)

2014-07-15T18:56:41 <michelled> right now, it\'s just the skeleton of the demo - more functionality will show up in the coming days

2014-07-15T19:03:34 <anastasiac> jhung, a question about your local deployment of the handbook: Do you see the \'edit\' links beside each heading in your local deployment?
2014-07-15T19:33:37 * michelled has quit
2014-07-15T19:40:17 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m back. Did you get your issue resolved?
2014-07-15T19:40:45 <anastasiac> nope, jhung, not sure if "it\'s just me" which is why I\'m wondering if you see the edit links
2014-07-15T19:41:47 <jhung> anastasiac: I won\'t be able to help much because my local copy doesn\'t work. I was hoping to use the dev site to test.
2014-07-15T19:42:09 <anastasiac> jhung, there is no dev site anymore :-)
2014-07-15T19:42:31 <anastasiac> ok, so you haven\'t actually deployed locally. I\'ll keep poking on my local instance
2014-07-15T19:43:25 <jhung> What I have is what came out of github. I don\'t have any data in my database tables anastasiac. So mine just comes up as a default looking Media Wiki.
2014-07-15T19:51:31 <anastasiac> jhung, I I think I figured it out. It\'s a setting in LocalSettings.php, which isn\'t committed to github
2014-07-15T19:52:27 <jhung> anastasiac good to know.
2014-07-15T19:52:33 <anastasiac> actually, jhung, if you are able to get a local deployment of the handbook working, that would be good, because then you could test and review my UIO upgrade branch :-)
2014-07-15T19:54:05 <jhung> anastasiac: I might not get around to that today and I\'m off next 3 days.
2014-07-15T19:54:33 <anastasiac> ok, well, I don\'t think it\'s that urgent
2014-07-15T19:55:21 <jhung> anastasiac: Can you confirm that the pull request I had previously was against master, not dev? https://github.com/fluid-project/handbook.floeproject.org/pull/12
2014-07-15T19:55:48 <anastasiac> ah, you\'re right jhung, it is. Sorry about that
2014-07-15T19:56:04 <jhung> anastasiac: no prob. I was confused as to why it wasn\'t letting me make a new pull req. :)
2014-07-15T19:56:16 <anastasiac> I re-opened your original one

2014-07-15T17:00:22 <cindyli> hi, Bosmon or Bosmon7
2014-07-15T17:00:53 <cindyli> I created a jira for the issue with valueMapper inversion - issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5472
2014-07-15T17:01:45 <cindyli> the jira has a comment with the pull request that has the unit test for it: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/545
2014-07-15T17:07:32 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks
2014-07-15T17:07:40 <Bosmon> I\'m astonished that so simple a transform can\'t be inverted
2014-07-15T17:07:43 <Bosmon> I will look at it soon
2014-07-15T17:08:12 <Bosmon> I imagine the real transform you want actually has 3 branches rather than 2? I remember there was some issue with undetermined values
2014-07-15T17:08:31 <Bosmon> This transform looks far too simple to require the 2 nested conditions that you have in the real app...
2014-07-15T17:08:36 <Bosmon> But getting it inverted will be a good start
2014-07-15T17:08:41 <cindyli> exactly, Bosmon, but that is another issue i wanna check with u regarding valueMapper
2014-07-15T17:08:59 <cindyli> that use case is,
2014-07-15T17:09:00 <cindyli> var model = {
2014-07-15T17:09:00 <cindyli> \tflashing: true,
2014-07-15T17:09:00 <cindyli> noflashing: true
2014-07-15T17:09:00 <cindyli> };
2014-07-15T17:09:18 <cindyli> i wrote this transformation rule
2014-07-15T17:09:23 <cindyli> var transform = [{
2014-07-15T17:09:23 <cindyli> type: "fluid.transforms.valueMapper",
2014-07-15T17:09:23 <cindyli> defaultOutputPath: "flashing",
2014-07-15T17:09:23 <cindyli> defaultOutputValue: "unknown",
2014-07-15T17:09:23 <cindyli> options: [
2014-07-15T17:09:24 <cindyli> {
2014-07-15T17:09:24 <cindyli> inputPath: "flashing",
2014-07-15T17:09:25 <cindyli> inputValue: true,
2014-07-15T17:09:25 <cindyli> outputValue: "flashing"
2014-07-15T17:09:26 <cindyli> },
2014-07-15T17:09:26 <cindyli> {
2014-07-15T17:09:27 <cindyli> inputPath: "noflashing",
2014-07-15T17:10:05 <cindyli> what i meant is when model values don\'t fall into the scopes defined in options, output the default model:
2014-07-15T17:10:13 <cindyli> {flashing: "unknown"}
2014-07-15T17:10:22 <cindyli> but seems this defaultOutputValue is not working
2014-07-15T17:10:41 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-07-15T17:11:09 <cindyli> do I use it wrong or there\'s another way to do it or framework issue?
2014-07-15T17:11:25 <Bosmon> Looks like a bug most likely
2014-07-15T17:11:30 <Bosmon> Please produce a further test case :)
2014-07-15T17:11:38 <cindyli> sure, and another jira
2014-07-15T17:11:50 <cindyli> since it\'s a different issue. what do you think, Bosmon
2014-07-15T17:12:43 <Bosmon7> cindyli - yes
2014-07-15T17:13:12 <cindyli> cool
2014-07-15T17:17:59 <jhernandez> clown: just reach linux/pull/49
2014-07-15T17:18:34 <clown> jhernandez:  ?
2014-07-15T17:18:41 <clown> what do you mean by "reach"?
2014-07-15T17:19:40 <clown> You mean:  look at https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49
2014-07-15T17:19:41 <clown> ?
2014-07-15T17:20:11 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-15T17:20:21 <jhernandez> wrt tuxguitar
2014-07-15T17:20:23 * Bosmon7 has quit
2014-07-15T17:21:04 <clown> what happened to the comments that were there?
2014-07-15T17:22:23 <jhernandez> what comments?
2014-07-15T17:22:47 <clown> whoops.  There are comments latet on where the test is when tuxguitar is not installed.
2014-07-15T17:22:51 <clown> *later
2014-07-15T17:23:02 <clown> So, is Bosmon asking for similar comments?
2014-07-15T17:23:09 <jhernandez> well
2014-07-15T17:23:17 <clown> or a better test?  :-)
2014-07-15T17:23:30 <jhernandez> just pushed a new commit to address another comment
2014-07-15T17:23:43 <jhernandez> I\'m thinking about it
2014-07-15T17:25:45 <jhernandez> well
2014-07-15T17:26:24 <clown> I see you took out the mock package json object.
2014-07-15T17:26:59 <clown> oh, you just moved it up.
2014-07-15T17:27:18 <jhernandez> yeah, but at least we\'re restoring the system to its previous state
2014-07-15T17:29:55 <jhernandez> clown: I\'m about to leave but still didn\'t get to any conclusion to address the tuxguitar issue
2014-07-15T17:30:21 <clown> jhernandez:  neither did I.  On the one hand, ...
2014-07-15T17:30:42 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6 we don\'t want to test packagekit itself. That\'s someone else\'s problem.  On the other hand, ...
2014-07-15T17:31:07 <clown> \xe2\x80\xa6 we do want some certainty that the add-on works.
2014-07-15T17:31:27 <clown> So:  what do we expect the add-on to actually do?
2014-07-15T17:31:42 <clown> Properly "link" with the packagekit library?
2014-07-15T17:32:22 <jhernandez> right now, installing packages is not a "must have"
2014-07-15T17:32:23 <clown> If so, how do you show it\'s linking correctly?
2014-07-15T17:32:58 * michelled has quit

2014-07-15T17:33:22 <clown> in the future?  Or not?
2014-07-15T17:33:29 <jhernandez> yeah, definetly
2014-07-15T17:33:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve addressed your pull request comments
2014-07-15T17:33:41 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, will take a look soon
2014-07-15T17:33:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-07-15T17:33:52 <cindyli> np
2014-07-15T17:34:01 <clown> okay, back up a bit:  what about the tests for searching?  That doesn\'t install anything...
2014-07-15T17:35:47 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-15T17:35:50 <clown> jhernandez:  wait a second.  The first search test tests if tuxguitar is installed *or avaiilable*.  It won\'t fail if tuxguitar is isnstalled.
2014-07-15T17:36:15 <clown> *installed*
2014-07-15T17:36:24 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-15T17:36:50 <clown> Bosmon\'s comment is:  "it appears \xe2\x80\xa6 it will fail if \xe2\x80\xa6 it is indeed installed".
2014-07-15T17:36:54 <clown> no, it won\'t.
2014-07-15T17:37:06 <clown> It will fail if tuxguitar doesn\'t exist at all.
2014-07-15T17:37:11 <jhernandez> it explodes when running "Checking that tuxguitar package is not installed"
2014-07-15T17:37:16 <jhernandez> yup
2014-07-15T17:37:21 <clown> "explodes"?
2014-07-15T17:37:23 <clown> :-)
2014-07-15T17:37:27 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-07-15T17:37:32 <clown> line number, jhernandez?
2014-07-15T17:37:48 <clown> where does it go boom?
2014-07-15T17:38:20 <jhernandez> hold a sec ...
2014-07-15T17:38:29 <clown> sure.
2014-07-15T17:38:53 <jhernandez> http://pastie.org/private/ntmrwssqs6elvjk274pha
2014-07-15T17:40:14 <clown> That looks like line 52 of nodepackagekit_tests.js
2014-07-15T17:40:56 <clown> Where there is a long comment that advertises the risk.
2014-07-15T17:41:21 <clown> Is that sufficient for Bosmon?  That comment?
2014-07-15T17:41:22 <jhernandez> should we dinamically decide wether to run the "exploding" tests or not?
2014-07-15T17:41:47 <cindyli> Justin_o: ur pull request for FLOE-193 is merged into the master
2014-07-15T17:41:53 <clown> I resent explode.  They fail, because the advertised initial conditioins aren\'t realized.
2014-07-15T17:42:13 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-15T17:42:17 <jhernandez> that\'s true
2014-07-15T17:42:26 <clown> We could:  test the intiail conditioins and not run the test.  Or, (dare I say it):  remove tuxguitar before running the test.
2014-07-15T17:43:02 <clown> By "test the initial conditions": check whether tuxguitar is installed and run the test if it isn\'t.

2014-07-15T17:43:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-07-15T17:43:22 <clown> Bosmon, are you around?
2014-07-15T17:43:44 <colinclark> He\'s off for the rest of the day, clown
2014-07-15T17:43:50 <colinclark> on a train to London, I think
2014-07-15T17:43:50 <clown> thanks colinclark.
2014-07-15T17:44:18 <colinclark> I think, though I haven\'t been following the discussion very closely, is that Bosmon\'s primary concern is ensuring we don\'t have tests that are brittle
2014-07-15T17:44:39 <colinclark> i.e. that can fail due to environmental differences on the systems they are run on
2014-07-15T17:45:10 <colinclark> we\'ve had a lot of trouble with that in the past
2014-07-15T17:45:36 <clown> colinclark:  yes, I get that.  It\'s fairly tough in this context because packages are changing all the time.  new vesrions.  obsolete packages. Luckily we are just worrying about the name of the package.
2014-07-15T17:45:42 <clown> Still, that might not be enough.
2014-07-15T17:45:47 <clown> *versions
2014-07-15T17:45:52 <colinclark> Is there some way we can distribute our own package as part of the tests?
2014-07-15T17:45:57 <colinclark> check to see that it is not there
2014-07-15T17:45:59 <colinclark> install it
2014-07-15T17:46:02 <colinclark> check to see that it is there
2014-07-15T17:46:03 <colinclark> and so on?
2014-07-15T17:46:23 <colinclark> that\'s probably hard, but it\'d be ideal, i think
2014-07-15T17:46:56 <clown> I thought of that, but I\'m not sure.  That might mean creating a "dummy" package that is in some repository, and in package kit\'s data base.
2014-07-15T17:47:41 <clown> I\'m wondering if packagekit itself has that.  It might do its own unit tests.
2014-07-15T17:47:54 <jhernandez> colinclark: it\'s an option to provide our own package, but since our packageKit add-on is distro-agnostic is not that easy
2014-07-15T17:48:09 <colinclark> ah, yes
2014-07-15T17:48:16 <colinclark> that doesn\'t sound easy
2014-07-15T17:48:54 <clown> It probably involves learning how to create packages that supports yum (rpm), apt, etc.
2014-07-15T17:49:08 <clown> \'cause pkit is just a front end to the "real" package managers.
2014-07-15T17:49:10 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, perhaps it\'s a good idea to look at packageKit\'s tests
2014-07-15T17:49:29 <clown> I have the time to look this afternoon.
2014-07-15T17:49:35 * clown crosses his fingers.
2014-07-15T17:49:39 <jhernandez> BUT
2014-07-15T17:49:39 * clown and his toes.
2014-07-15T17:49:44 <jhernandez> I would say, for now
2014-07-15T17:50:04 <clown> make the test conditional.
2014-07-15T17:50:05 <clown> ?
2014-07-15T17:50:14 <clown> I could that in about half an hour...
2014-07-15T17:50:44 <jhernandez> yeah, either some conditional + advertisement
2014-07-15T17:50:59 <clown> It is advertised in a comment.
2014-07-15T17:51:09 <jhernandez> or removing tuxguitar at the very beginning (if it\'s installed)

2014-07-15T13:07:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: grade name?
2014-07-15T13:07:55 <Justin_o> for the component
2014-07-15T13:08:09 <Justin_o> what did you call the feedback tool component.. or there isn\'t one yet?
2014-07-15T13:08:18 <cindyli> the namespace?
2014-07-15T13:08:43 <cindyli> Justin_o: "gpii.metadata.feedback"

2014-07-15T13:10:24 <Justin_o> i\'ll use that too, hopefully it won\'t cause too many conflicts
2014-07-15T13:10:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: also i wonder if we should implement the other parts.. e.g. buttons as sub components
2014-07-15T13:11:07 <cindyli> in FLOE-193?
2014-07-15T13:11:54 <cindyli> Justin_o: I think those are more belong to other jiras.
2014-07-15T13:14:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. i was just making a general statement
2014-07-15T13:16:16 <cindyli> Justin_o: yes, having buttons as subcomponents is a good idea as now there would be an upper level for the menu bar
2014-07-15T13:17:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: yep.. i\'ll get the feedback tool in as is as a component that fetches it\'s markup.. we\'ll probably have to chop up the template a bit more for the subcomponents.. but we can do that in the specific jiras
2014-07-15T13:17:27 <cindyli> sounds good, Justin_o

2014-07-15T14:44:27 <clown> jhung, okay go ahead.
2014-07-15T14:46:23 <jhung> I\'m looking into describing algebra equations using markup. Assume someone has an equation "5 x 6" and then writes out "Five times six". What would the Aria look like for these two pieces of content clown?
2014-07-15T14:46:28 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-07-15T14:47:16 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-07-15T14:49:27 <clown> jhung, do you have sample markup?  Are they writing <span>Five times six</span> or something like that?
2014-07-15T14:53:08 <clown> jhung, the recommendation is to (1) use MathML, (2), wrap the MathML in a <div role="math" aria-label="X"> where "X" is the equation-as-a-string.
2014-07-15T14:54:24 <clown> Using your "5x6" example:  <div role="math" aria-label="Five times six"><<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> !<\xe2\x80\x94 mathml goes here \xe2\x80\x94> </math></div>
2014-07-15T14:54:40 <jhung> clown: I was in the middle of elaborating but you answered it yourself. :) Yes that\'s what I was going for.
2014-07-15T14:55:01 <clown> aside:  use of a <div> or <span> depends on whether you want block level vs. inline.
2014-07-15T14:55:24 <clown> jhung, check this for more details:  http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#math
