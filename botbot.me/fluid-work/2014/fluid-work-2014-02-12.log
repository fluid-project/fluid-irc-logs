2014-02-12T21:58:51 <cindyli1> Bosmon2: in the new model relay system, how do we share model directly between 2 relay components? in the old world we use:
2014-02-12T21:58:53 <cindyli1> model: "{fluid3674root}.model",
2014-02-12T21:58:53 <cindyli1> members: {

2014-02-12T21:58:53 <cindyli1> }
2014-02-12T21:59:03 <cindyli1> it no longer seems working
2014-02-12T22:02:26 <Bosmon2> cindyli1 - you no longer fiddle about with appliers like that

2014-02-12T15:31:20 <colinclark> they network is a bit flaky
2014-02-12T15:33:06 <Justin_o> colinclark, kasparnet: here\'s the manual test plan http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/PMT_PCP_Manual_Test_Plan
2014-02-12T15:33:21 <cindyli> np, colinclark. do you rmb Florian Roser? about 2 months ago, you forwarded his questions about how to connect to gpii server to Justin_o and I.
2014-02-12T15:33:34 <Justin_o> i\'ll be making a few more modifications and maybe a name change to reflect the state for the pilots..
2014-02-12T15:33:36 <colinclark> oh yes
2014-02-12T15:33:38 <colinclark> I do
2014-02-12T15:34:46 * avtar joined the channel
2014-02-12T15:35:15 <cindyli> colinclark: since our gpii server is changing recently and same as api. i\'m thinking to reply and forward his email to gpii list and fluid-work list so other ppl can put in their thoughts. just wanna make sure it\'s ok to do that, no privacy issue?
2014-02-12T15:35:40 <cindyli> considering you initially forwarded his email to only Justin_o and I
2014-02-12T15:35:50 <colinclark> yup, I think that\'s just fine
2014-02-12T15:36:19 <cindyli> cool. thanks, colinclark
2014-02-12T15:36:23 <colinclark> no problem
2014-02-12T15:37:00 <kasparnet> ooooh, nice! Thanks Justin_o !!
2014-02-12T15:37:56 <kasparnet> linked it from here, justin_o: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-609
2014-02-12T15:38:25 <Justin_o> kasparnet: thanks
2014-02-12T15:40:13 <cindyli> Justin_o: is this the jira that Florian should follow: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-589
2014-02-12T15:41:21 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. i believe so
2014-02-12T15:42:28 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2014-02-12T15:43:36 <Justin_o> kasparnet: what do you think about putting this pull request ( https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/23 ) on hold till the GPII-589 GPII-609 issue is all solved

2014-02-12T18:07:50 <clown> jhernandez, no problem.  I figure you are busy.  And I figured out there is no meeting :-)
2014-02-12T18:07:55 <clown> but thanks anyway.
2014-02-12T18:08:14 <jhernandez> yup, Kasper and Colin are in Germany
2014-02-12T18:08:46 * jhung has quit
2014-02-12T18:09:55 <jhernandez> you know, drinking beers, eating big german saussages with sauerkraut

2014-02-12T18:19:00 <clown> sorry, someone here wanted to ask me a question, and that led to a long discussion.
2014-02-12T18:19:41 <clown> I just saw your description of typical German fare.

2014-02-12T18:24:37 <michelled> Justin_o: is pull 19 mostly just moving code around?
2014-02-12T18:24:45 <michelled> has the code already gone through review?
2014-02-12T18:25:20 <clown> jhernandez:  have you met with Claudia about "kiosk" mode?  Or, is there anything new about GPII-340?
2014-02-12T18:25:31 <clown> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-340
2014-02-12T18:25:57 <jhernandez> nope
2014-02-12T18:27:13 <jhernandez> we should meet with others working on this to clarify the scope of this implementation
2014-02-12T18:28:05 <jhernandez> and of course, clarifying how the device reporter will report these situations
2014-02-12T18:28:36 <clown> of course.
2014-02-12T18:28:52 <jhernandez> I think that there is a partner who should take care of this implementation under the cloud4all project
2014-02-12T18:29:02 <jhernandez> but I\'m not completely sure about it
2014-02-12T18:29:04 <clown> did you see my thoughts about various states like "installed", "installable", "launchable", etc.?
2014-02-12T18:29:10 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-02-12T18:29:53 <clown> okay.  who are the others?  Is anyone pushing for this meeting?  Or is it low priority?
2014-02-12T18:30:23 <clown> that is, should I be spending more time on the packagekit stuff instead?
2014-02-12T18:30:37 * clown is looking for direction.
2014-02-12T18:31:33 <jhernandez> dunno who are the others, but neither Claudia or me are part of this
2014-02-12T18:34:39 <jhernandez> and re your direction ...
2014-02-12T18:36:00 <jhernandez> I think that Kasper can push for having this topic-oriented meeting
2014-02-12T18:36:14 <jhernandez> not low but medium prority
2014-02-12T18:37:09 <clown> okay.
2014-02-12T18:37:30 <jhernandez> re packagekit, I think that we\'re in a good shape, and maybe we should look for other device reporter-like stuff
2014-02-12T18:38:36 <jhernandez> I think that your "states" (from your last comment on GPII-340) are sensible
2014-02-12T18:38:59 <jhernandez> and maybe we should start planning on report some of these situations
2014-02-12T18:39:17 <clown> re: packagekit, when are you going to review my last pull request.  ;-)
2014-02-12T18:39:23 <clown> ?
2014-02-12T18:41:09 <jhernandez> it\'s reviewed and I\'m ok with it, but I still didn\'t merged it, sorry
2014-02-12T18:42:00 <clown> \\o/
2014-02-12T18:42:15 * clown wonders if that graphic means anything to jhernandez.
2014-02-12T18:42:24 <clown> Thanks for the review.
2014-02-12T18:42:28 <jhernandez> heh
2014-02-12T18:42:55 <jhernandez> yes, to me that means something "cute"
2014-02-12T18:42:57 <jhernandez> :P
2014-02-12T18:43:00 <clown> Yes, please merg.  I want to get rid of the  "packagekitBridgeFilters" branch, or whatever I called it.  I shouldn\'t have created it.
2014-02-12T18:43:21 <jhernandez> heh
2014-02-12T18:43:23 <jhernandez> sure
2014-02-12T18:43:24 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-02-12T18:43:36 <jhernandez> sorry, but I gotta run
2014-02-12T18:43:39 <clown> \\o/  is a person\'s head with their arms raised over it.  Means, "yay".
2014-02-12T18:43:52 <clown> Okay.  I\'ll talk to you later jhernandez.
2014-02-12T18:43:52 <jhernandez> I have to cook lasagna tonight and I\'m missing some ingredients
2014-02-12T18:44:05 <clown> garlic?
2014-02-12T18:44:10 <jhernandez> heh
2014-02-12T18:44:11 <clown> :-)
2014-02-12T18:44:11 <jhernandez> the meat!
2014-02-12T18:44:12 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-02-12T18:44:49 <clown> I hear that kasper and colin have some german sausages.  maybe you should contact them?
2014-02-12T18:44:54 <jhernandez> just missing the meat and basil
2014-02-12T18:45:00 <jhernandez> hahahaha

2014-02-12T18:46:49 <clown> okay, talk to later jhernandez
