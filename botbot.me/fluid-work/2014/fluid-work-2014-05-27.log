2014-05-27T13:58:25 <Justin_o> anastasiac: could you please verify if this is still an issue http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5223
2014-05-27T13:58:39 <anastasiac> sure, Justin_o
2014-05-27T13:58:59 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks

2014-05-27T14:25:04 <anastasiac> Justin_o, FLUID-5223 is still an issue. I've commented to that effect on the JIRA.

2014-05-27T14:54:34 <simonjb> Justin_o: from your experience with steve's doc tool yesterday, is it reasonable to now close http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5326
2014-05-27T14:57:18 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks for double checking that
2014-05-27T14:58:24 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess so.. it would be more convenient if i didn't have to specify each file individually i guess. but i think it should be fine for the release as is.. provided that we can work with the html files for the documentation site
2014-05-27T14:59:24 * sgithens has quit
2014-05-27T15:01:04 <simonjb> Justin_o: ok, I will close this issue and if we want to make feature changes, let's file those separately
2014-05-27T15:01:21 <Justin_o> simonjb: sounds good
2014-05-27T15:04:48 <Justin_o> simonjb: I think there were some things we wanted to talk to anastasiac about regarding the docs.. do you both have time today for that?
2014-05-27T15:06:09 <simonjb> Justin_o, anastasiac: absolutely; I would also like to chat about docpad and our thoughts on moving ahead with it
2014-05-27T15:07:21 <Justin_o> michelled: would you be interested in joining that too? ^
2014-05-27T15:08:23 <michelled> I think I probably won't be able to, Justin_o
2014-05-27T15:09:09 <Justin_o> michelled:  ok
2014-05-27T15:16:04 <anastasiac> simonjb, Justin_o, yes, I'm available to chat today. I'll try to have a look at simonjb's docpad work soon. Still wading through emails...
2014-05-27T15:16:46 <simonjb> anastasiac: welcome back :)
2014-05-27T15:16:55 <anastasiac> thanks, simonjb
2014-05-27T15:16:59 <anastasiac> you too :-)
2014-05-27T15:17:28 <simonjb> Justin_o, anastasiac: would it be helpful for me to come into the office?
2014-05-27T15:18:58 <Justin_o> simonjb: i'm fine either way.
2014-05-27T16:26:59 * [o__o] joined the channel
2014-05-27T16:27:16 <simonjb> Justin_o: there is an id set

2014-05-27T16:31:07 <Justin_o> colinclark: sorry, just saw all your messages
2014-05-27T16:31:16 <colinclark> yup, on it

2014-05-27T16:33:26 <simonjb> Justin_o: I think we should be good with the ids -- here's the section on linking to ids in HTML4 http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#anchors-with-id
2014-05-27T16:33:43 <simonjb> and it's good in HTML5
2014-05-27T16:35:20 <Justin_o> simonjb: excellent thanks.. i see my test didn't work because the name i tried in the url was formatted differently than i had expected
2014-05-27T16:35:46 <simonjb> Justin_o :)
2014-05-27T16:37:39 <Justin_o> simonjb: was there a task that could be worked on before the talk with anastasiac
2014-05-27T16:38:34 * kasparnet has quit
2014-05-27T16:40:15 <simonjb> Justin_o: there's http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5328 and http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5377
2014-05-27T16:40:49 <Justin_o> simonjb: ah okay.. i thought those weren't ready.. i can do them
2014-05-27T16:41:20 <simonjb> Justin_o: or, having looked at the tool yesterday, is there work to do for http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5329
2014-05-27T16:42:39 <Justin_o> simonjb: i think we had said we were just going to use what was in the code comments now, and not try to back port things from the wiki... i could be mistaken
2014-05-27T16:43:03 <Justin_o> simonjb: anyways, i'll start with FLUID-5377
2014-05-27T16:44:50 <simonjb> Justin_o: maybe for safety, start with the pages that have been most recently edited? until we talk to anastasiac at 2pm
