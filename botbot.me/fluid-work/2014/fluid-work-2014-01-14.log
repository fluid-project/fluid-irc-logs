2014-01-14T23:46:06 <kasparnet> ping avtar
2014-01-14T23:46:17 <avtar> hey kasparnet
2014-01-14T23:46:22 <kasparnet> Hi avtar
2014-01-14T23:46:26 <avtar> hi kasparnet
2014-01-14T23:46:35 <kasparnet> heya
2014-01-14T23:46:40 <avtar> hello
2014-01-14T23:47:52 <kasparnet> so first of all - preferences server works great with latest changes
2014-01-14T23:48:03 <kasparnet> no more explosions when logging in with a bad/non-existing NP set
2014-01-14T23:48:52 <kasparnet> secondly - the change that yura made has the unfortunate side-effect that one can no longer upload preferences
2014-01-14T23:49:14 <kasparnet> but we've updated the NP sets of the review2 branch to contain everything we need
2014-01-14T23:49:51 <kasparnet> would it be possible for you to add all np-sets of the review2 branch (in testData/preferences) to the couch server
2014-01-14T23:50:05 <kasparnet> overwriting any duplicates
2014-01-14T23:50:11 <kasparnet> (or just clearing and repopulate)
2014-01-14T23:50:21 <avtar> have they changed since the last deploy?
2014-01-14T23:50:24 <kasparnet> yup
2014-01-14T23:50:31 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/209
2014-01-14T23:50:43 <kasparnet> but only the pref sets need to be redeployed
2014-01-14T23:50:48 * vjoanna has quit
2014-01-14T23:51:15 <avtar> more importantly were you just congratulating yourself? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/209#issuecomment-32319988
2014-01-14T23:51:40 <kasparnet> avtar: ofc - I was doing an amazing job, and that deserves praises
2014-01-14T23:51:41 <kasparnet> :D
2014-01-14T23:51:58 <kasparnet> btw s/redeployed/repopulated/
2014-01-14T23:52:36 <avtar> yeah man
2014-01-14T23:52:41 <avtar> you gotta enjoy yourself http://i.imgur.com/E2MkT.gif
2014-01-14T23:52:57 <kasparnet> lol
2014-01-14T23:53:02 <kasparnet> is that from bobs burgers?
2014-01-14T23:53:07 <avtar> yup
2014-01-14T23:53:08 <kasparnet> sexy
2014-01-14T23:53:26 <kasparnet> btw yura/yzen, if you see this
2014-01-14T23:53:49 <kasparnet> the fix that you made also affects the uploading of preferences
2014-01-14T23:54:05 <kasparnet> giving an error of attempting to find onError of undefined
2014-01-14T23:54:31 <kasparnet> it can be tested by running: curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' --data-binary @<my-file>.json http://preferences.gpii.net/user/my_user
2014-01-14T23:54:45 <kasparnet> where <myfile> should be referring to an actual json file :)
2014-01-14T23:55:34 <kasparnet> I believe we will have all the needed (and working) NP sets up on the preferences server once avtar repopulates it - so this is no longer an emergency
2014-01-14T23:56:07 <kasparnet> the most important thing is that the demoes no longer explode when we miss the rfid reader :)
2014-01-14T23:56:15 <avtar> kasparnet: they finish uploading
2014-01-14T23:56:27 <avtar> *finished
2014-01-14T23:56:59 <avtar> does that mean no more changes will get pushed to review2 now?
2014-01-14T23:58:02 <kasparnet> avtar: I believe so!
2014-01-14T23:58:17 <kasparnet> I just tested one of the new NP sets and it's working beautifully

2014-01-14T19:19:56 <kasparnet> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-519 <-- colinclark, michelled
2014-01-14T19:20:02 <kasparnet> with clearer steps to repro
2014-01-14T19:21:04 <kasparnet> we\'re leaving the meeting room now and heading back to the hotel, will be back online in 20 mins or so
2014-01-14T19:21:05 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-14T19:22:33 <colinclark> Bosmon: michelled is working to reproduce this issue
2014-01-14T19:22:48 <colinclark> but if anything strikes you as a likely culprit, I\'d appreciate your input
2014-01-14T19:23:08 <colinclark> sounds to me like it should be pretty easy to recreate
2014-01-14T19:23:16 <colinclark> and that we just have some absent error handling
2014-01-14T19:23:36 <michelled> colinclark: to respond to your earlier question, no, this system is still not working. I just reinstall node, but that didn\'t help
2014-01-14T19:24:00 <colinclark> Can you use the Lenovo workstation that Justin_o_ and cindyli were using?
2014-01-14T19:24:11 <michelled> good idea
2014-01-14T19:24:18 <colinclark> sounds like there\'s no point in fussing with a messed up system
2014-01-14T19:24:25 <Bosmon> ok, I will investigate it shortly
2014-01-14T19:24:28 <colinclark> I\'ll fire up my Linux VM
2014-01-14T19:24:40 <colinclark> but I think I\'d better go have that long nap soon or I will be doomed at 4 am tonight
2014-01-14T19:24:47 <Justin_o_> michelled, colinclark: i had it setup on Windows 8.1 there.. there is also a Windows 7 instance on that machine though if you need to use it

2014-01-14T20:30:40 <michelled> yzen: does your pull request mean that you\'ve fixed the issue?
2014-01-14T20:34:52 <Bosmon> Hi kasparnet - I think you may have merged that pull into master by mistake :)
2014-01-14T20:34:57 <Bosmon> Rather than into the review2 branch......
2014-01-14T20:36:06 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/207/files
2014-01-14T20:36:07 <kasparnet> Bosmon: fucking hell!!!! I\'m so sorry!
2014-01-14T20:36:25 <Bosmon> It is an exceptionally helpful fix, but I think we would have wanted some tests before it got into master proper...
2014-01-14T20:36:27 <kasparnet> I\'m a zombie these days
2014-01-14T20:36:48 <Bosmon> This is the condition you will reduce the world to, once the dominance of **KASPARNETT** is on the rise : P
2014-01-14T20:37:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah - definitely - it wasn\'t my intention to merge it with master only into review2
2014-01-14T20:37:31 <kasparnet> haha - indeed - and at that point in time, I will just *ZAP* anyone who tells my I made a mistake
2014-01-14T20:38:08 <kasparnet> but until then I realize I\'ll have to abide by the rules, which are that one cannot just uncritically merge random stuff into master :)
2014-01-14T20:39:26 <Bosmon> hahaha
2014-01-14T20:39:35 <Bosmon> Ok, well, we\'ll just have to have a note on this one
2014-01-14T20:39:43 <Bosmon> yzen - do you think you could make up a further pull request with some tests?
2014-01-14T20:40:47 <avtar> kasparnet: is 207 still being merged with the review2 branch?
2014-01-14T20:41:11 <kasparnet> avtar: yeah, doing it right now
2014-01-14T20:41:32 <avtar> k
2014-01-14T20:42:03 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yes, definitely! but I really wont be able to do it until Thursday... got quite a bit of stuff to do tonight, and review tomorrow 8am and all day :S
2014-01-14T20:42:42 <kasparnet> would that be acceptable (sorry - I know it\'s not ideal - but I\'m pretty strapped on time these days)
2014-01-14T20:43:24 <kasparnet> avtar: the fix is in review: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/208
2014-01-14T20:43:40 <michelled> kasparnet: does this get you to the point where the demos work?
2014-01-14T20:43:48 <Bosmon> kasparnet - no worries, let\'s see if yzen can do it in the meantime
2014-01-14T20:43:57 <kasparnet> cool - thanks Bosmon
2014-01-14T20:44:06 <kasparnet> michelled: yes, it does
2014-01-14T20:44:17 <michelled> wow! that awesome
2014-01-14T20:44:28 <kasparnet> michelled: (not counting all the clever ways I can manage to mess things up before tomorrow at 8 :) )
2014-01-14T20:44:36 <avtar> kasparnet: the changes are online
2014-01-14T20:44:41 <kasparnet> michelled: it is!!! I\'m very excited about it
2014-01-14T20:44:48 <kasparnet> avtar: holy fuck, that was quick
2014-01-14T20:44:49 <michelled> perhaps if they work now, you should go to sleep and not do anything more unit 8 am :)
2014-01-14T20:45:09 <avtar> kasparnet: that\'s what she said :\'(
2014-01-14T20:45:21 <kasparnet> lol
2014-01-14T20:45:49 <kasparnet> michelled: I wish - do have a few loose ends, but at least I\'m not expecting it to be another > 3am day :)
2014-01-14T20:46:00 <kasparnet> anyway - off to some food - will be back in 1hr
2014-01-14T20:46:06 <michelled> what are the loose ends at this point?
2014-01-14T20:46:08 <michelled> can we help?
2014-01-14T20:47:12 <kasparnet> michelled: no, dont think so - it\'s mostly just doing little changes to and retest a machine
2014-01-14T20:47:14 <kasparnet> thanks though
2014-01-14T20:47:24 <kasparnet> be back in a bit
2014-01-14T20:47:25 <michelled> ok, have a good dinner
2014-01-14T20:48:01 <michelled> perhaps this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetschentaart
2014-01-14T20:48:33 <Bosmon> A TART made with *NONSENSE*!

2014-01-14T21:34:34 <yzen> is that something very recent ; )?
2014-01-14T21:35:18 <kasparnet> apparently javi had switched the multiple MM and with the normal setup, going back and forth when trying to reproduce the bug
2014-01-14T21:35:36 <kasparnet> and it was left in normal (ie. non multiple MM mode) when I got it
2014-01-14T21:37:02 <kasparnet> so I wasn\'t testing the correct thing
2014-01-14T21:37:03 * clown joined the channel
2014-01-14T21:37:39 <kasparnet> not that I\'m blaming Javi - I should have noticed (hence the unfit) .... anyway there is still an issue haunting us
2014-01-14T21:41:28 <yzen> kasparnet: so what you mean is the unchanged version worked ?

2014-01-14T21:53:54 <avtar> hi
2014-01-14T21:55:22 <avtar> kasparnet: hi
2014-01-14T21:56:28 <kasparnet> heya
2014-01-14T21:56:53 <kasparnet> could you double check that the preferences server has been updated from review2 and restarted?
2014-01-14T21:57:24 <kasparnet> it\'s behaving like yzen\'s change haven\'t made it in
2014-01-14T21:57:28 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2014-01-14T21:57:39 <avtar> could you try now?
2014-01-14T21:57:53 <avtar> it\'s using review2
2014-01-14T21:58:11 <kasparnet> avtar: trying again, but getting same message
2014-01-14T21:58:21 <kasparnet> just a sec, let me check review2 branch
2014-01-14T21:59:00 * cindyli has quit
2014-01-14T22:00:39 <kasparnet> avtar: ok, looks like review2 branch of GPII does indeed contain yzen\'s fix
2014-01-14T22:01:17 <kasparnet> if it\'s properly in universal/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesServerUtilities.js  should exist
2014-01-14T22:02:13 <kasparnet> avtar: (stupid question, but) did you restart the kettle server after the fix?
2014-01-14T22:02:18 * jhung has quit
2014-01-14T22:02:37 <avtar> i restarted the node process altogether
2014-01-14T22:02:48 <kasparnet> hmm
2014-01-14T22:03:14 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-01-14T22:03:37 <avtar> npm install wasn\'t run btw
2014-01-14T22:03:46 <avtar> since you said there were just sets in the update
2014-01-14T22:04:01 <kasparnet> nope - that should be ok, I believe
2014-01-14T22:04:15 <kasparnet> yzen: can probably confirm that
2014-01-14T22:04:49 <avtar> also preferencesServerUtilities.js exists
2014-01-14T22:05:22 <kasparnet> oh the mysteries... my head cant handle it
2014-01-14T22:05:53 <avtar> yzen: the pref server should still be running in production mode, correct?
2014-01-14T22:06:04 <yzen> avtar: yes
2014-01-14T22:08:34 <avtar> kasparnet: this is what happened when the pref server was updated http://pastie.org/pastes/8633822/text
2014-01-14T22:09:52 <kasparnet> I must say, you make some convincing arguments!
2014-01-14T22:20:24 <kasparnet> avtar: hmm.. I really dont understand this
2014-01-14T22:21:27 <kasparnet> yura just tried setting up an instance on his local machine w/ couchdb and swapping between pre-fix and post-fix versions of review2, the output of (his equivalent of) http://preferences.gpii.net/user/carla12a is different
2014-01-14T22:21:45 <kasparnet> (where carla12a is just a random non-existing user)
2014-01-14T22:22:50 <kasparnet> and I guess it couldn\'t be caching on my side
2014-01-14T22:23:08 <kasparnet> as picking any old random token for the NP set should avoid that
2014-01-14T22:23:23 <avtar> kasparnet: was carla12a part of this last pull request?
2014-01-14T22:23:46 <kasparnet> avtar: nope - "carla12a" was just a random token that doesn\'t exist
2014-01-14T22:24:01 <kasparnet> (as the problem happens when calling non-existing tokens)
2014-01-14T22:24:08 <avtar> yzen: what\'s the output of your request?
2014-01-14T22:25:51 <kasparnet> I should probably have gone with something like qwertyuiop as that seems a bit more random
2014-01-14T22:26:24 <avtar> kasparnet: what should be the expected result?
2014-01-14T22:26:33 <kasparnet> avtar: something like: {"isError":true,"message":"not_found: missing"} where "isError", etc is toplevel of the object
2014-01-14T22:27:01 <kasparnet> (without the token like I get now)
2014-01-14T22:27:52 <avtar> i can start fresh if that\'s preferable
2014-01-14T22:28:18 <avtar> delete the existing couchdb database and do a git clone, upload the sets again
2014-01-14T22:29:25 <kasparnet> that would be great
2014-01-14T22:29:33 <kasparnet> hope it\'s not too much work though
2014-01-14T22:30:55 <kasparnet> avtar: On my side I promise I\'ll punch myself hard in the stomach if I\'ve made you do all that in vain
2014-01-14T22:31:03 <kasparnet> brb

2014-01-14T17:02:54 <michelled> yzen, Justin_o_: how does 2:00 on Thursday sound for the Ask Yura Anything?
2014-01-14T17:20:03 <colinclark> and then 5:00 on Thursday for the Get Yura Drunk and Sing His Praises, michelled?
2014-01-14T17:20:15 <michelled> yeah
2014-01-14T17:26:12 <Justin_o_> colinclark: the order sounds appropriate :)
2014-01-14T17:26:25 <Justin_o_> michelled: 2 is good
2014-01-14T17:26:40 <kasparnet> colinclark, michelled, yzen, Bosmon: we just did the first demo run with ~4 sub-demos failing.. It seems that the system has suddenly become a lot more prone to crashing
2014-01-14T17:27:36 <kasparnet> with something along the lines of the error that was seen when the NP sets were wrong
2014-01-14T17:28:03 <kasparnet> I did run everything through yesterday/today before hand, where everything was working
2014-01-14T17:29:40 <colinclark> Do you have error messages or any details, kasparnet?
2014-01-14T17:30:22 <yzen> kasparnet: what exactly are you testing ? can we try it on our machines?
2014-01-14T17:32:18 <colinclark> I\'ll poke the RBMM and STMM to make sure they\'re responding correctly
2014-01-14T17:33:12 <colinclark> Double check, kasparnet that your Matchmaker proxy.json contains the correct references to the MM servers: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/review2/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/configs/proxy.json#L15-L19
2014-01-14T17:33:36 <colinclark> michelled: Can you browse the deployed version of the Preferences Server and double check if the correct sets are indeed deployed?
2014-01-14T17:35:10 <colinclark> kasparnet: I can confirm that the online Flow Manager, the STMM, and the RBMM are returns results I expect
2014-01-14T17:35:19 <colinclark> "are returning"
2014-01-14T17:36:13 <colinclark> Is your network connected properly on the demonstration machines?
2014-01-14T17:37:02 * michelled has quit
2014-01-14T17:42:38 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah - networks are properly connected
2014-01-14T17:42:45 <kasparnet> the bug isn\'t consistent
2014-01-14T17:43:30 <kasparnet> it seems to happen when eg. when the RFID cards are misread
2014-01-14T17:43:39 <kasparnet> ie. wrong token passed or whatever
2014-01-14T17:51:47 <colinclark> oh no
2014-01-14T17:55:22 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i\'ve been staring at the panels.. I\'m thinking of refactoring them by splitting them into grades and grouping those as base for specific panels..
2014-01-14T17:55:47 <Justin_o_> cindyli: is there any reason that the icon is a renderer decorator?
2014-01-14T17:56:19 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-14T17:56:48 <Justin_o_> jhung: when did you want to talk about the metadata planning?
2014-01-14T17:57:41 <cindyli> Justin_o_: you mean the indicator component?
2014-01-14T17:58:19 <Justin_o_> cindyli: yes
2014-01-14T17:58:29 <jhung> Justin_o_: can you give me 10 mins?
2014-01-14T17:58:48 <Justin_o_> jhung: sure
2014-01-14T17:59:03 * michelled joined the channel
2014-01-14T17:59:05 <cindyli> Justin_o_: no reason that the indicator component must be a renderer decorator.
2014-01-14T17:59:19 <Justin_o_> cindyli: okay.. cool thanks.
2014-01-14T17:59:23 <cindyli> np
2014-01-14T17:59:25 <colinclark> michelled: Further reports are that 80% of our demos are working
2014-01-14T17:59:33 <colinclark> And that it\'s not the servers that are the problem
2014-01-14T17:59:57 <colinclark> jhernandez\'s current guess is that it relates to the Windows RFID reader sending "GUEST" as the token when it gets confused
2014-01-14T18:00:09 <michelled> thx for the update colinclark
2014-01-14T18:00:36 <colinclark> He\'s in the midst of debugging
2014-01-14T18:01:25 <colinclark> so we might need to come up with something creative, like an empty preference set called GUEST
2014-01-14T18:01:30 <colinclark> or figure out why we\'re freaking
2014-01-14T18:03:34 <cindyli> Justin_o_: do we have a jira for creating "video features" bucket? don\'t find it on the iteration page
2014-01-14T18:03:45 <Justin_o_> cindyli: hmm.. not sure..
2014-01-14T18:03:52 <Justin_o_> i\'ll take a quick look in jira
2014-01-14T18:05:05 <Justin_o_> cindyli: i didn\'t see one
2014-01-14T18:05:22 <cindyli> ok, i will create on and add to iteration page, Justin_o_
2014-01-14T18:05:36 <jhung> Justin_o_ ready
2014-01-14T18:05:47 <Justin_o_> cindyli: thanks
2014-01-14T18:06:04 <Justin_o_> jhung: okay.. danaayotte_ cindyli are you ready for metadata tasking?
2014-01-14T18:06:08 <cindyli> yes
2014-01-14T18:06:08 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-14T18:07:55 <cindyli> jhung: do we have a jira for creating "video features" bucket? Justin_o_ and I didn\'t find it. just wanna double check with you before I create a new one
2014-01-14T18:15:51 <jhung> cindyli: You can use FLOE-138 since the work is closely related.
2014-01-14T18:16:01 <cindyli> cool. thanks, jhung

2014-01-14T18:42:52 <yzen> avtar: hi
2014-01-14T18:43:26 <avtar> yzen: could you list the gpii components that clients communicate with directly?
2014-01-14T18:43:39 <avtar> not the backend services like proxies
2014-01-14T18:43:56 <yzen> avtar: atm cloud based flow manager and preferences server
2014-01-14T18:44:05 <avtar> ok thanks
2014-01-14T18:47:12 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-01-14T18:47:18 <avtar> kasparnet: hi
2014-01-14T18:47:51 <avtar> is gregg with you?
2014-01-14T18:48:32 <michelled> yzen: what about the matchmakers? is that done through something else?
2014-01-14T18:48:53 <yzen> michelled: as far as i know only flow manager talks to the match makers
2014-01-14T18:48:57 <yzen> not the actual clients
2014-01-14T18:49:20 <yzen> but i might be misunderstanding avtar \'s question
2014-01-14T18:49:49 <kasparnet> yzen, michelled, Bosmon7, colinclark: ok, it looks like Javi figured out how to reproduce the error
2014-01-14T18:49:53 <kasparnet> with our current setup
2014-01-14T18:50:37 <kasparnet> (running the system locally, but with the proxy setup --- and with the modification in flowmanager/configs/development.json to use the online prefs server)
2014-01-14T18:50:52 <kasparnet> (though I dont think the last prefs server thing matter)
2014-01-14T18:51:37 <kasparnet> anyway - if you log in with any bogus NP -- try eg: localhost:8081/user/yurayurawhatdidyoudonowquestionmark/login
2014-01-14T18:53:19 <colinclark> yurayurawhatdidyoudonowquestionmark :P
2014-01-14T18:54:06 <avtar> yzen: no, that is what i was referring to
2014-01-14T18:54:18 <yzen> k
2014-01-14T18:54:29 <avtar> basically what urls are visible to a client\'s device
2014-01-14T18:54:36 <colinclark> avtar: Gregg is with me, virtually
2014-01-14T18:54:38 <colinclark> do you need anything?
2014-01-14T18:55:13 <avtar> colinclark: i spoke to someone at digicert who can assist with the registration process if gregg calls them
2014-01-14T18:55:19 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-14T18:55:23 <colinclark> do you need the cert for the demo?
2014-01-14T18:55:29 <colinclark> or can this wait until later in the week?
2014-01-14T18:55:51 <avtar> i think tony wants a certificate for the ctr demo
2014-01-14T18:58:00 <kasparnet> Just to make it a bit more clear how we produced the error
2014-01-14T18:58:17 <colinclark> avtar: ok
2014-01-14T18:58:26 <kasparnet> Use the review2 branches of the windows and universal repository
2014-01-14T18:58:27 <colinclark> Gregg just responded saying "waiting for instructions"
2014-01-14T18:58:34 <colinclark> it\'s late in Lux and we\'re still meeting, but send him the details
2014-01-14T18:58:45 <colinclark> and, simultaneously, ask Tony if we can live without it somehow
2014-01-14T18:58:50 <colinclark> just in case
2014-01-14T18:59:12 <kasparnet> we use NODE_ENV=fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.multipleMatchMakers
2014-01-14T18:59:18 <avtar> colinclark: would you be able to acquire the digicert account details from gregg in case it is a hard requirement?
2014-01-14T18:59:35 <colinclark> kasparnet is best equipped to corner him
2014-01-14T18:59:57 <avtar> CSRs will need to be generated and uploaded for each cert and it\'s probably best that i do that for gregg
2014-01-14T19:00:58 <colinclark> ojk
2014-01-14T19:01:03 <colinclark> send him an email with all the details that you need
2014-01-14T19:01:07 <kasparnet> and in universal we have modified the "gpii/node_modules/flowmanager/configs/development.json" file to point the preferences server at http://preferences.gpii.net/user/%token instead of the local prefs server)
2014-01-14T19:02:10 * yzen has quit
2014-01-14T19:06:44 <avtar> colinclark: ok
2014-01-14T19:07:00 <avtar> he should have the instructions
2014-01-14T19:09:42 <colinclark> avtar: I guess I should paint the picture for you
2014-01-14T19:09:57 <colinclark> They\'ve been stuffed in a room for nearly 12 hours, practicing
2014-01-14T19:09:57 <avtar> u
2014-01-14T19:10:09 <colinclark> Gregg still has to prepare a script and a few other things
2014-01-14T19:10:11 <colinclark> quick dinner
2014-01-14T19:10:13 <colinclark> a good night\'s sleep
2014-01-14T19:10:29 <colinclark> so, worst case scenario, I\'m really hoping Tony is prepared for no cert, just in case
2014-01-14T19:10:37 <colinclark> I strongly suspect Gregg will get it done
2014-01-14T19:10:50 <colinclark> but I\'m preparing for the worst--everyone looked SO tired on the video
2014-01-14T19:11:10 <colinclark> michelled: Is yzen looking at the issue jhernandez and kasparnet reported?
2014-01-14T19:11:12 <colinclark> or is anyone?
2014-01-14T19:11:24 <michelled> I\'m trying to reproduce it myself
2014-01-14T19:11:33 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-14T19:11:35 <michelled> yzen is in a meeting and will be online in a bit
2014-01-14T19:11:37 <colinclark> is your system okay now?
2014-01-14T19:11:41 <colinclark> ok, cool
2014-01-14T19:13:48 <avtar> colinclark: there\'s the self signed cert option as well
2014-01-14T19:14:01 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-14T19:14:05 <colinclark> i guess we\'ll see what happens
2014-01-14T19:14:06 <avtar> but with the added feature of browser warnings
2014-01-14T19:15:30 <colinclark> yeah
2014-01-14T19:15:34 <colinclark> I worry about that
2014-01-14T19:15:44 <colinclark> does Tony have hardcoded https URLs or something?

2014-01-14T13:23:14 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: hey justin
2014-01-14T13:23:30 <kasparnet> javi and I are just trying out everything on his linux machine
2014-01-14T13:25:00 <kasparnet> Kostas has got everything set up on a windows box, and we\'ve tried everything PMT on that -- which would be fine for a demo
2014-01-14T13:25:13 <kasparnet> but on linux, we\'re experiencing an odd problem
2014-01-14T13:25:38 <kasparnet> the when attempting to fire up the demos, we just get a blank screen
2014-01-14T13:25:50 <kasparnet> with no error messages, no server logs, etc
2014-01-14T13:26:02 <kasparnet> is this something you\'ve seen before?
2014-01-14T13:26:30 <kasparnet> we noticed when checking things out that package.json referred to yzen\'s master branch
2014-01-14T13:26:56 <kasparnet> which we found was a little strange -- dont know if this could be the sinner
2014-01-14T13:28:25 <Justin_o_> no i haven\'t seen that issue.. are you getting any console errors in the browser?
2014-01-14T13:28:38 <Justin_o_> which web server are you using for PMT/PCP on linux?
2014-01-14T13:29:09 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: ah - javi just found some logs
2014-01-14T13:29:16 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: as for Yura\'s repo in package.json.. i know he made changes yesterday that were waiting to go into universal. we had to use his repo till then
2014-01-14T13:29:37 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: let me know if i can help with those
2014-01-14T13:30:05 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: ok - the reason for our puzzlement was that he would use master for work in progress
2014-01-14T13:30:36 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: wow - interesting - the bug is due to Javis machine being spanish
2014-01-14T13:30:44 <kasparnet> some files are missing in an "es" dir
2014-01-14T13:30:51 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: damn spaniards
2014-01-14T13:30:54 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: yes.. i\'m surprised that it didn\'t go into the proper repo or to some review branch.. we might have to ask yzen or michelled about it
2014-01-14T13:31:48 <Justin_o_> kasparnet: lol, yes.... it didn\'t look like localization was properly setup.. i think there is only a message.json file for english

2014-01-14T13:36:28 <cindyli> did you see the emails from Chris and Boyan? we didn\'t mention in the update emails yesterday that both PCP and PMT were fixed and working
2014-01-14T13:36:57 <cindyli> let me know if you are replying their email, Justin_o_, if not, i will do
2014-01-14T13:37:57 <Justin_o_> cindyli: maybe we both can :) i was going to ask you if Chris\' fix was actually needed.. i didn\'t have a problem with the token creation
2014-01-14T13:38:12 <Justin_o_> i\'ll write up a reply to them and you can fill in anything i missed
2014-01-14T13:38:14 <cindyli> i don\'t think it\'s needed, Justin_o_

2014-01-14T13:46:59 <cindyli> certainly, Justin_o_
2014-01-14T13:47:22 <Justin_o_> you want to chat on Skype?

2014-01-14T15:45:01 <colinclark> phew
2014-01-14T15:45:02 <jhernandez> slow demo under control
2014-01-14T15:45:04 <colinclark> you guys rule
2014-01-14T15:45:06 <colinclark> hugely rule
2014-01-14T15:45:23 <jhernandez> pcp/pmt .... I can run them, but I can\'t apply the settings
2014-01-14T15:45:56 <jhernandez> well, it doesn\'t make the "push" of the NP set to the prefs server
2014-01-14T15:45:59 <jhernandez> dunno why
2014-01-14T15:46:21 <colinclark> Justin_o_ or cindyli might know
2014-01-14T15:47:06 <Justin_o_> jhernandez: is that only in PMT, PCP, or both?
2014-01-14T15:47:30 <Justin_o_> jhernandez: also, are you getting any errors in the browser\'s console?
2014-01-14T15:48:47 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-01-14T15:48:55 <jhernandez> Justin_o_: both
2014-01-14T15:49:12 <Justin_o_> jhernandez: what port is the preference server running on?
2014-01-14T15:49:20 <jhernandez> mmmm
2014-01-14T15:49:29 <jhernandez> should I run my own prefs server?
2014-01-14T15:49:44 <jhernandez> it doesn\'t push the NP sets to preferences.gpii.net?
2014-01-14T15:50:02 <Justin_o_> jhernandez: well.. i guess the flow manager is supposed to be a proxy for it.. as far as i understand..
2014-01-14T15:50:02 <kasparnet> colinclark: hi colin
2014-01-14T15:50:02 <jhernandez> oh!
2014-01-14T15:50:20 <Justin_o_> jhernandez: I think the PMT/PCP post to localhost:8081
2014-01-14T15:50:23 <Justin_o_> cindyli: is that correct
2014-01-14T15:50:28 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o_
2014-01-14T15:50:35 <jhernandez> Justin_o_: it\'s in my prefs folder
2014-01-14T15:50:37 <colinclark> hi kasparnet
2014-01-14T15:50:38 <kasparnet> jhernandez: if you run the local system in normal development mode, I think it would hit your local prefs server
2014-01-14T15:50:39 <jhernandez> yes!
2014-01-14T15:50:57 <kasparnet> colinclark: yes - everything ok
2014-01-14T15:51:05 <colinclark> wonderful
2014-01-14T15:51:06 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I\'m running it on development mode
2014-01-14T15:51:11 <Justin_o_> jhernandez, kasparnet: so that means it\'s okay?
2014-01-14T15:51:20 <colinclark> do i have a bit of time to eat breakfast before i have to do my slow demo rehearsal?
2014-01-14T15:51:38 <jhernandez> colinclark: sure (i think)
2014-01-14T15:51:55 <kasparnet> colinclark: no sure - asking manuel
2014-01-14T15:52:06 <kasparnet> well - go for it
2014-01-14T15:52:21 <kasparnet> we\'ll do demos before slowdemo if you\'re not available
2014-01-14T15:52:45 <kasparnet> Justin_o_: I\'m not sure - not next to Javi atm
2014-01-14T15:53:05 <colinclark> I won\'t be long
2014-01-14T15:53:06 <jhernandez> Justin_o_: kasparnet I should check the config files ...
2014-01-14T15:54:00 <jhernandez> but I\'m pretty sure that it\'s a config thing
2014-01-14T15:54:28 <jhernandez> anyway, going downstairs ...
2014-01-14T15:54:50 <Justin_o_> jhernandez, kasparnet: okay i should be around for the next 4 hours if you need anything
2014-01-14T15:55:22 <jhernandez> Justin_o_: ok, thank you so much!
2014-01-14T15:56:16 <kasparnet> colinclark: btw, I\'m amazed how fast the RB MM is running on the IDRC server
2014-01-14T15:56:30 <kasparnet> it feels pretty much seamless when using it
2014-01-14T15:58:41 <kasparnet> javi - can you check the exact token of our demo4.1 user?
'

b'2014-01-14T00:03:03 <kasparnet> thanks so much avtar
2014-01-14T00:20:21 <colinclark> how\'s everything going, kasparnet and jhernandez? You guys ok?
2014-01-14T00:20:24 <colinclark> you must be so tired!
2014-01-14T00:21:35 <kasparnet> colinclark: we\'ve just started going through the demos
2014-01-14T00:21:44 <kasparnet> (again :) )
2014-01-14T00:22:03 <colinclark> As always, let me know if there\'s anything I can do
2014-01-14T00:22:18 <colinclark> I\'d order you guys a pizza and beer, but I\'m not sure I\'d know how to in Luxembourg
2014-01-14T00:24:35 <kasparnet> colinclark: I\'m not sure anything is open in luxembourg atm
2014-01-14T00:25:02 <jhernandez> colinclark: order beers
2014-01-14T00:28:35 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-14T00:36:10 <jhernandez> :P
2014-01-14T00:38:36 <kasparnet> colinclark: we\'ve started with the dirty hacks now
2014-01-14T00:38:44 <colinclark> awesome
2014-01-14T00:38:56 <colinclark> I\'m doing a bit of that myself for the slow demo
2014-01-14T00:39:20 <kasparnet> colinclark: we\'ll try to keep the branch as clean as possible, but we\'re getting exhausted now so ...
2014-01-14T00:39:33 <colinclark> Honestly, at this point, you should just do what you need to
2014-01-14T00:39:44 <kasparnet> cool - thanks for the blessing
2014-01-14T00:39:57 <colinclark> Fish is keeping track of everything committed to review2 and commenting it so we know what to ultimately merge back into master
2014-01-14T00:50:20 <colinclark> kasparnet: Is it going to be okay to do this demo on a Linux computer?
2014-01-14T00:50:31 <colinclark> The slow demo

2014-01-14T01:14:05 <jhernandez> sgithens: well ...
2014-01-14T01:14:07 <jhernandez> yes and no
2014-01-14T01:14:08 <kasparnet> colinclark: unless jhernandez wont let me touch his computer
2014-01-14T01:14:15 <jhernandez> xDDDDDDD
2014-01-14T01:14:49 <colinclark> jhernandez: You\'ve got a machine running GNOME 3 available for the demo on Wednesday that kasparnet can use?
2014-01-14T01:15:10 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-01-14T01:15:18 <jhernandez> kasparnet: is the blind person!
2014-01-14T01:15:33 <jhernandez> he won\'t know that he\'s using gnome3
2014-01-14T01:15:40 <jhernandez> :P
2014-01-14T01:17:26 <sgithens> hahahahhahahahaha
2014-01-14T01:18:38 <sgithens> I hope someone takes pictures
2014-01-14T01:18:53 <sgithens> I wanted to see KASPARNET blind folded and operating things
2014-01-14T01:19:10 <sgithens> With the Zoo York shirt
2014-01-14T01:21:50 <colinclark> lol

2014-01-14T03:09:52 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'m wondering if you have a quick moment to look over the log of my demo and share your thoughts
2014-01-14T03:10:13 <colinclark> I\'m largely interested in opinions about the "non-technically technical" nature of the language
2014-01-14T03:10:23 <Bosmon> Sure
2014-01-14T03:10:26 <colinclark> and whether you think it suitably covers the main aspects of the flow
2014-01-14T03:10:28 <colinclark> https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/8412295
2014-01-14T03:11:02 <colinclark> The idea of this demo is that the preference set is configured to enlarge the font size, cursor, and to use high contrast mode
2014-01-14T03:11:20 <colinclark> my idea here is that it will be easier for the reviews themselves to read the log output :P
2014-01-14T03:11:30 <colinclark> So Kasper will log in, just using the browser
2014-01-14T03:11:40 <colinclark> since I will explain that this is a "behind the scenes view"
2014-01-14T03:12:00 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-01-14T03:12:26 <colinclark> In some cases you\'ll see that I\'ve "summarized" the payload to simplify it so that they see the important parts
2014-01-14T03:12:37 <colinclark> in other places I\'ve tried to show the whole payload so it looks "complex" ;)
2014-01-14T03:13:21 <Bosmon> wow
2014-01-14T03:13:42 <colinclark> I\'m also curious if you think that I should do this with the live Preferences Server
2014-01-14T03:13:55 <Bosmon> These are actual real log statements? : P
2014-01-14T03:13:57 <colinclark> or if it\'s suitable to have a localhost URL there, and to explain that this shows how we can easily move components around
2014-01-14T03:14:03 <colinclark> yes, they\'re actual log statements
2014-01-14T03:14:14 <colinclark> but unfortunately they are such that they will never, in present form, make it into master
2014-01-14T03:14:29 <colinclark> do they look too unloggy?
2014-01-14T03:14:34 <Bosmon> They\'re fine
2014-01-14T03:14:35 <colinclark> :P
2014-01-14T03:14:38 <Bosmon> What is wrong with their form?
2014-01-14T03:15:07 <colinclark> Well, it\'s the ones that "summarize" a payload
2014-01-14T03:15:16 <Bosmon> ah
2014-01-14T03:15:17 <colinclark> that would be quite misleading for an actual developer
2014-01-14T03:15:25 <colinclark> such as the Matchmaker strategy example I was asking you about before
2014-01-14T03:15:37 <colinclark> " Requesting a match from the gpii.matchMaker.flatMatchmaker strategy. "
2014-01-14T03:15:57 <colinclark> But I don\'t see why that sort of thing couldn\'t be fixed
2014-01-14T03:16:03 <Bosmon> In theory, we should have enough events for you to attach the logging to listeners
2014-01-14T03:16:04 <colinclark> and the logging facility centralized
2014-01-14T03:16:11 <colinclark> yes, I think you\'re probably right
2014-01-14T03:16:13 <Bosmon> And then stick them all in a giant heap using "distributeOptions"
2014-01-14T03:16:27 <colinclark> That was how I imagined I\'d tackle it originally
2014-01-14T03:16:37 <colinclark> but there just wasn\'t time, what with the chaos this weekend :)
2014-01-14T03:16:44 <Bosmon> That\'s fine
2014-01-14T03:16:46 <Bosmon> I think they look great
2014-01-14T03:17:24 <Bosmon> The ordering is a bit interesting
2014-01-14T03:17:27 <colinclark> Yes
2014-01-14T03:17:36 <Bosmon> It might be useful to have a "sequence graph" to refer to
2014-01-14T03:17:40 <colinclark> I will use this to speak to the fact that our system is asynchronous and thus "highly efficient"
2014-01-14T03:17:50 <colinclark> The sequence does actually change between runs
2014-01-14T03:17:52 <colinclark> in some cases
2014-01-14T03:17:55 <Bosmon> cool
2014-01-14T03:18:07 <colinclark> I\'ll be showing them the architecture "circles" diagram
2014-01-14T03:18:10 <colinclark> as Gregg has taken to calling it
2014-01-14T03:18:39 <colinclark> And so I\'ll be able to say "now you can see phase 3 of the diagram"
2014-01-14T03:18:43 <Bosmon> It might be helpful to log "forks" and "joins" though
2014-01-14T03:18:47 <Bosmon> Just to reduce confusion slightly
2014-01-14T03:18:50 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-14T03:18:57 <colinclark> such as where?
2014-01-14T03:19:11 <Bosmon> Well, I\'m not actually sure where :)
2014-01-14T03:19:25 <Bosmon> I presume there is a "join" before the matchmaker starts
2014-01-14T03:20:03 <Bosmon> And you could add a log at the origination point of the solutions registry request
2014-01-14T03:20:28 <colinclark> Ah yes
2014-01-14T03:20:40 <colinclark> Perhaps I\'ll log when "ready to match" fires
2014-01-14T03:20:46 <colinclark> to mark that join point, as you say
2014-01-14T03:20:58 <colinclark> And I\'ll log the request point for the SR
2014-01-14T03:27:41 <colinclark> Bosmon: Any thoughts about local vs. remote Preferences Server?
2014-01-14T03:28:30 <Bosmon> You don\'t think it\'s remote "enough"?
2014-01-14T03:28:39 <colinclark> I was going to say "for this demo, you\'ll see that I have many of the core services installed locally on this laptop, but the demos you\'ll see throughout the next two days will use versions deployed in the cloud"
2014-01-14T03:28:48 <colinclark> that was my worry, but it\'s useful in a different way to talk about this issue
2014-01-14T03:28:54 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-14T03:29:03 <Bosmon> They seem sufficiently remote to me
2014-01-14T03:29:06 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-14T03:29:06 <Bosmon> They have URLs and all : P
2014-01-14T03:29:10 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-14T03:29:25 <colinclark> I thought the file-based URL of the Ontology Server would look sufficiently "stubby"
2014-01-14T03:29:59 <colinclark> and I could talk about how our tools enable us to "rapidly prototype component and then develop them into more robust web services over time"
2014-01-14T03:30:00 <colinclark> :P
2014-01-14T03:30:02 <colinclark> shoot me now
2014-01-14T03:30:26 <colinclark> "evolve them" :P
2014-01-14T03:30:47 <Bosmon> I wonder if you will see the whites of their eyes
2014-01-14T03:30:52 <Bosmon> The ***EUROCRRATS***
2014-01-14T03:30:57 <Bosmon> Will there be any video linkage?
2014-01-14T03:41:37 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-14T03:41:41 <colinclark> I\'ll be on GoToMeeting
2014-01-14T03:41:45 <colinclark> I\'ll a big talking head
2014-01-14T03:41:50 <Bosmon> cool
2014-01-14T03:55:22 <colinclark> Bosmon: here\'s my latest and hopefully final version: https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/8412295
2014-01-14T03:59:21 <Bosmon> colinclark - "i" before "e" except after "c" : P
2014-01-14T03:59:32 <Bosmon> You have "Matchmaker Server recieved a request"
2014-01-14T03:59:42 <colinclark> wow!
2014-01-14T03:59:43 <Bosmon> Should we also log the origination point of the solutions registry request?
2014-01-14T03:59:49 <Bosmon> Is that deployed locally?
2014-01-14T03:59:55 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-14T04:00:04 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-14T04:00:34 <Bosmon> Actually I\'m puzzled by the "Requesting solutions information" log
2014-01-14T04:00:36 <colinclark> Amazingly, I\'ve been consistently misspelling received tonight
2014-01-14T04:00:53 <Bosmon> Why does it contain a mixture of solutions for different platforms?
2014-01-14T04:00:59 <colinclark> Bosmon: Yes, this is the most problematic part
2014-01-14T04:01:04 <colinclark> I will have to explain that it\'s a bug
2014-01-14T04:01:11 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-14T04:01:30 <colinclark> for some reason that kasparnet has never explained to me, the Device Reporter stub actually never uses those "win32" and "linux" installed solutions files
2014-01-14T04:01:40 <colinclark> it just uses installed_solutions.json, which contains EVERYTHING
2014-01-14T04:01:52 <colinclark> fortunately we\'re smart enough to ultimately filter out the irrelevant ones
2014-01-14T04:01:58 <Bosmon> aha
2014-01-14T04:01:59 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-14T04:02:04 <Bosmon> So it is not deployed remotely
2014-01-14T04:02:14 <Bosmon> You know, I think they will appreciate this demo
2014-01-14T04:02:19 <Bosmon> It does make our architecture look good : P
2014-01-14T04:02:22 <colinclark> wow, that\'s cool
2014-01-14T04:02:24 <Bosmon> As well as being helpful for us
2014-01-14T04:02:29 <colinclark> Our architecture in this regard is actually quite cool overall
2014-01-14T04:02:32 <colinclark> it has many rough edges
2014-01-14T04:02:38 <colinclark> but this system is genuinely quite decoupled
