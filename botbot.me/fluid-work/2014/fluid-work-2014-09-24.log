2014-09-24T14:56:37 <anastasiac> Jess_, danaayotte and I have been cleaning up the PGA wiki pages. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to send out a link to the list. Do you think it looks ready? http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Preferences+for+Global+Access
2014-09-24T14:57:47 <Jess_> anastasiac: thanks \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x99m curious about the essential tools mockup links
2014-09-24T14:58:26 <anastasiac> Jess_, thanks - that\xe2\x80\x99s a bug, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix it. The wiki editor seems to have trouble with links in lists sometimes...
2014-09-24T14:59:04 <Jess_> anastasiac: and the related projects page taht is linked was going to point to FLoe, P4A, C4A, GPII, right?
2014-09-24T14:59:43 <anastasiac> yes, Jess_, it has some links, it still needs a bit of work
2014-09-24T15:00:14 <Jess_> and anastasiac what is the first essentials tool mockup meant to point to?
2014-09-24T15:01:04 <danaayotte> that\'s Gregg\'s presentation, right?
2014-09-24T15:01:14 <anastasiac> Jess_, that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the mock-ups that Gregg\xe2\x80\x99s student made, that slide show

2014-09-24T15:02:11 <anastasiac> Jess_, the link is fixed now, thanks for catching that

2014-09-24T15:17:03 <Jess_> anastasiac: can you double check that the link doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require permission for the viewer?
2014-09-24T15:17:55 <anastasiac> blech - it does, Jess_. Maybe we should just remove the link?
2014-09-24T15:28:47 <Jess_> yes, i think so

2014-09-24T20:16:20 <Justin_o> sgithens___: if you look at the above pirate pad we had some discussion about your api generation tool. I"ll summarize here as well.
2014-09-24T20:16:45 <Justin_o> 1) would it be possible to output html fragments instead. Then we would be able to insert them into the sites template files.
2014-09-24T20:17:29 <Justin_o> 2) There still seems to be an issue with it outputting for empty fluid.defaults blocks. There is one in the core framework directory where the fluid.defaults is called inside of another function
2014-09-24T20:17:40 * anvk has quit
2014-09-24T20:17:56 <Justin_o> 3) The indentation of the code blocks seems to be slightly off.
2014-09-24T20:18:44 <Justin_o> 4) also the read me is out of date, but I was able to get the tool to run fairly quickly. Thanks for removing the non-api and allowing directories.
