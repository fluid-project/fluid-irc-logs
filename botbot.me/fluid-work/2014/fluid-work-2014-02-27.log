2014-02-27T20:01:36 <colinclark> simonjb: I've made a bit of stupid scheduling mistake
2014-02-27T20:01:49 <colinclark> and have to run to a chiropractor's appointment in 30 minutes
2014-02-27T20:02:03 <colinclark> I had hoped to have at least a short chat with you and Bosmon2 before I left
2014-02-27T20:02:08 <colinclark> but it might be too compressed
2014-02-27T20:02:15 <colinclark> How late are you planning to be working today?
2014-02-27T20:02:16 <simonjb> colinclark: should we reschedule to tomorrow?
2014-02-27T20:02:24 <colinclark> I could do tonight or tomorrow, yes
2014-02-27T20:02:56 <simonjb> colinclark: I'll be working until 6pm this evening
2014-02-27T20:12:05 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-27T20:12:09 <colinclark> maybe tomorrow makes the most sense
2014-02-27T20:12:16 <colinclark> but I'm really sorry for screwing up my schedule
2014-02-27T20:14:48 <simonjb> colinclark: no problem -- let me know what time works
2014-02-27T20:15:25 <colinclark> Let's assume the same time tomorrow
2014-02-27T20:15:27 <colinclark> 3 pm EST
2014-02-27T20:15:35 <colinclark> since it's late enough for Bosmon2's night owl schedule
2014-02-27T20:15:39 <simonjb> sounds good
2014-02-27T20:15:46 <colinclark> and my whole afternoon is free, so we can dedicate a good amount of time to it
2014-02-27T20:17:37 <Bosmon2> Hi - so sorry too guys to be late

2014-02-27T14:44:40 <kasparnet> hey Justin_o
2014-02-27T14:44:43 <kasparnet> sort of
2014-02-27T14:44:47 <kasparnet> in the meeting
2014-02-27T14:44:53 <kasparnet> sorry for not having replied to your mail
2014-02-27T14:45:12 <Niharika> Hello! I want to participate in GSoC on the \xc2\xa8Picture Dictionary\xc2\xa8 project. How do I get started? :)
2014-02-27T14:46:32 <Justin_o> kasparnet: no problem.. i\'m going to look through the pulls again today and send you another e-mail with what needs to go in and the change that needs to happen in the gpii config to get things working. if you saw chris\' follow up e-mail it\'s a pretty good summary of what needs to happen for GPII-625. although i\'m going to do a bit more testing and code
2014-02-27T14:46:32 <Justin_o> clean up.
2014-02-27T14:47:02 <Justin_o> kasparnet: when do you plan on looking at these pulls... so i can make sure i get things ready by a certain time
2014-02-27T14:47:10 <kasparnet> Justin_o: the error you had with 404... I\'m thinking it might have to do with our production mode being buggy
2014-02-27T14:47:35 <kasparnet> it might be worth editing the normal development mode of the flowmanager to point to the remote preferences server and try the system out
2014-02-27T14:47:43 <Justin_o> kasparnet: could be.. chris got things working with the development config by changing the preferences server to point at the remote one
2014-02-27T14:47:51 <Justin_o> kasparnet: yes.. this worked
2014-02-27T14:48:15 <kasparnet> Justin_o: I probably wont have t chance to look at it until after dinner tonight

2014-02-27T14:50:40 <Justin_o> Niharika: thanks for your interest.. i guess first steps would be to look over the design and see if you have any questions about that, and to start to familiarize yourself with Infusion.. here are the docs for it http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Infusion+Documentation
2014-02-27T14:51:01 <Justin_o> Niharika: and here is the git repo https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion
2014-02-27T14:51:16 <Niharika> Okay Justin_o. I was going through them. :)
2014-02-27T14:51:18 <Niharika> Thank you.
2014-02-27T14:51:21 <Justin_o> kasparnet: okay :) how long do you think that will be from now
2014-02-27T14:52:44 * cindyli has quit
2014-02-27T14:55:03 <Justin_o> Niharika: cool, let me know if you have any questions. I expect that we\'ll have released Infusion 1.5 by the time the coding period starts for GSoC. So you should become familiar  with what\'s in master already and not worry too much about 1.4
2014-02-27T14:55:09 * anujdeshpande has left the channel
2014-02-27T14:55:34 <Niharika> Justin_o: Okay. Point noted. I\xc2\xb4ll dive into the code.

2014-02-27T15:30:44 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: perfect thanks
2014-02-27T15:41:32 <cindyli> Justin_o: i tested GPII-600 branch, especially the PCP part that cannot be launched in my vm, on the windows test machine. everything seems ok except the announcing of the blank drop down list item. If it\'s ok that I can spend more time on it, thinking to look into this issue. and i wonder if you have time to do a code review for this pull request?
2014-02-27T15:42:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure we have time till the early afternoon to get things ready for kasparnet . I\'m currently trying to look over chrispetsos\'s pull requests but i can check yours later
2014-02-27T15:43:03 <cindyli> great. thanks for checking it, Justin_o
2014-02-27T15:48:13 * vjoanna has quit
2014-02-27T15:49:27 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: so i see two places for improvement..1) for the language drop down there should be (English) next to the translations for the english language
2014-02-27T15:49:36 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: 2) the on/off toggles aren\'t localized
2014-02-27T15:52:15 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: do you have time to make changes for those?
2014-02-27T15:52:22 <Justin_o> and do we have localizations for on/off?
2014-02-27T15:53:34 <chrispetsos> JUstin_o: (1) has been pushed. For (2) i don\'t have localizations, thought ON/OFF is somehow universal :-)
2014-02-27T15:54:19 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: ^
2014-02-27T15:54:20 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: lol i only speak english so you probably know better than me
2014-02-27T15:54:59 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: i think that\'s fine for now though, i guess we should look into on/off post pilots then.. i\'ll try with your latest changes.. thanks for sticking around
2014-02-27T15:55:30 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: yes, i tried to figure out a greek translation for that in the past and saw there wasn\'t something short to fit in there. And couldn\'t use "\xce\x95\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xb7\xce\xbc\xce\xad\xce\xbd\xce\xbf/\xce\x91\xcf\x80\xce\xb5\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xce\xbf\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xce\xb9\xce\xb7\xce\xbc\xce\xad\xce\xbd\xce\xbf" In there...
2014-02-27T15:56:14 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: so will you take on GPII-625?
2014-02-27T15:56:37 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. i\'ll take that one on.. thanks for your help with it
2014-02-27T15:56:56 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: ok, good luck, gotta run
