b'2014-07-03T15:53:54 <jhernandez> yes
2014-07-03T15:53:58 <colinclark> On the second screen on page 2
2014-07-03T15:54:10 <jhernandez> 3rd
2014-07-03T15:54:14 <colinclark> yes, sorry
2014-07-03T15:54:18 <colinclark> 3rd picture on page 2
2014-07-03T15:54:26 <colinclark> I wondered if "active" mean "currently keyed in"
2014-07-03T15:54:31 <colinclark> but I actually don\'t know
2014-07-03T15:54:38 <colinclark> vjoanna or danaayotte, can you explain?
2014-07-03T15:54:50 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-03T15:55:31 <jhernandez> or just, that USB contains your token (or somebody else\'s token)
2014-07-03T15:55:50 <colinclark> ah maybe
2014-07-03T15:56:18 <colinclark> Probably that it contains your token, yes
2014-07-03T15:56:29 <colinclark> Seems like a good guess :)
2014-07-03T15:59:01 <vjoanna> colinclark, jhernandez: yes, that\'s correct \'active\' means that it contains your token
2014-07-03T15:59:48 <jhernandez> vjoanna: ok
2014-07-03T15:59:50 <vjoanna> all the USBs listed are all the ones currently keyed in
2014-07-03T16:00:20 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-03T16:00:37 <vjoanna> a usb could also be active, but not inserted
2014-07-03T16:00:42 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-03T16:00:44 <jhernandez> that\'s the point
2014-07-03T16:01:00 <jhernandez> can you elaborate it a little bit more?
2014-07-03T16:01:23 <danaayotte> vjoanna by "keyed in" you just mean inserted, right?
2014-07-03T16:01:32 * colinclark has quit
2014-07-03T16:01:36 <vjoanna> yes
2014-07-03T16:03:16 <danaayotte> jhernandez vjoanna so a user could "sign in" to their GPII account by inserting a USB, and then eject the USB but remain active in GPII account?
2014-07-03T16:04:12 <vjoanna> an \'active\' usb, that\'s not \'inserted\' could happen when the user has logged in with another authentication method or another usb
2014-07-03T16:04:24 <vjoanna> does that make sense?
2014-07-03T16:05:55 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-03T16:06:01 <jhernandez> now I\'m even more confused
2014-07-03T16:06:02 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-07-03T16:06:14 <danaayotte> because the user previously used a USB to store their token?  and system recognizes the account?
2014-07-03T16:06:57 <vjoanna> by \'active\' i meant that the usb contains the user\'s token, not that they\'re active on their GPII account
2014-07-03T16:07:34 <vjoanna> but the user would have to be active on their GPII account in order to see this page
2014-07-03T16:08:46 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-03T16:08:47 <jhernandez> so
2014-07-03T16:09:05 <jhernandez> our GPII account will save a list of our well-known usbs?
2014-07-03T16:10:16 <vjoanna> yes, USBs that contain tokens and USBs that are currently plugged in
2014-07-03T16:10:33 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-07-03T16:11:27 <jhernandez> ok, "currently plugged in", and what about "< vjoanna> an \'active\' usb, that\'s not \'inserted\' could happen when the user has logged in with another authentication method or another usb"
2014-07-03T16:12:21 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-03T16:12:22 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-07-03T16:12:23 <jhernandez> got it
2014-07-03T16:12:38 <jhernandez> sorry
2014-07-03T16:12:50 <vjoanna> that would be a usb that contains a token, but not plugged in
2014-07-03T16:12:59 <jhernandez> yes
2014-07-03T16:13:15 <vjoanna> no worries! let us know if you have anymore questions or concerns
2014-07-03T16:13:22 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-03T16:13:23 <jhernandez> thanks
2014-07-03T16:13:23 <danaayotte> vjoanna jhernandez (I think the word active is a bit confusing)
2014-07-03T16:13:42 <jhernandez> yeah, I got confused by that
2014-07-03T16:13:50 <danaayotte> can\'t think of anything better right now...
2014-07-03T16:14:02 <vjoanna> yes - any suggestions for improving the wording are welcomed as well! :)
2014-07-03T16:14:22 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-07-03T16:15:17 <jhernandez> so, just to be sure about all the functionalities ...
2014-07-03T16:16:58 <jhernandez> by "add" we\'re going to add this USB to the "list of well-known USB sticks" in our GPII account
2014-07-03T16:17:53 <jhernandez> isn\'t it?
2014-07-03T16:18:11 <vjoanna> yes
2014-07-03T16:18:21 <vjoanna> and it also adds a token to the usb
2014-07-03T16:18:27 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-03T16:18:35 <jhernandez> got it
2014-07-03T16:19:01 <vjoanna> :)
2014-07-03T16:21:00 <danaayotte> vjoanna jhernandez and delete removes the token from that USB, right? but you\'ll still see it on the list as long as it remains inserted
2014-07-03T16:21:27 <vjoanna> yes
2014-07-03T16:21:47 <jhernandez> yes
2014-07-03T16:21:51 <jhernandez> so
2014-07-03T16:21:53 <danaayotte> yes :)
2014-07-03T16:23:10 <jhernandez> IMVHO, shouldn\'t active mean that this USB is inserted and you\'re already keyed-in as this user?
2014-07-03T16:24:44 <jhernandez> don\'t know, perhaps a better way to recognise the differnet USBs
2014-07-03T16:25:00 <jhernandez> in a similar way you can recognise the wifis on your phone
2014-07-03T16:25:03 * Bosmon7 has quit
2014-07-03T16:25:33 <vjoanna> hmm interesting
2014-07-03T16:26:10 <jhernandez> at a glance, you can easily know the wifis that you already know and are available
2014-07-03T16:26:28 <jhernandez> those that you know but there aren\'t
2014-07-03T16:26:50 <jhernandez> and of course, available wifis around that you don\'t know at all
2014-07-03T16:27:32 <danaayotte> at the moment, though, there could be more than one "active" USB, right?
2014-07-03T16:27:33 <vjoanna> yes that makes sense - i remember seeing that on Android
2014-07-03T16:28:00 <jhernandez> yeah, seeing "active" more than once in the same list could be confusing
2014-07-03T16:28:10 <jhernandez> isn\'t it?
2014-07-03T16:28:37 * michelled has quit
2014-07-03T16:28:53 <danaayotte> yes, i think if we changed "active" to something like "has my preferences" it would help
2014-07-03T16:28:57 <vjoanna> yeah - two different labels would make sense \'active\' and (with token?)
2014-07-03T16:29:15 <jhernandez> dunno
2014-07-03T16:29:22 <jhernandez> I\'m not very good at naming
2014-07-03T16:29:23 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-03T16:30:03 <jhernandez> and of course, it\'s just my opinion, and I\'m just a humble oompa loompa
2014-07-03T16:30:05 <jhernandez> :P
2014-07-03T16:30:37 <danaayotte> wait, now I\'m confused vjoanna, "active" and (with token) are currently the same, right? but jhernandez you are suggesting that active should mean something else
2014-07-03T16:30:59 <danaayotte> ?
2014-07-03T16:32:34 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-03T16:32:45 <jhernandez> xD
2014-07-03T16:32:53 <danaayotte> isn\'t this already true?: "shouldn\'t active mean that this USB is inserted and you\'re already keyed-in as this user?"
2014-07-03T16:33:42 <danaayotte> if you\'re seeing the list, you\'re keyed-in/logged-in
2014-07-03T16:34:23 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-03T16:34:48 <jhernandez> that\'s true, but it\'s because the "inserted" label
2014-07-03T16:36:12 <danaayotte> elaborate?
2014-07-03T16:36:14 <vjoanna> yes- right now \'active\' would also be used when a USB has a token but no currently inserted (the user has logged in with another method)
2014-07-03T16:36:21 <danaayotte> yes
2014-07-03T16:37:22 <danaayotte> i think that if we just improved the wording of \'active\' all will be well
2014-07-03T16:37:36 <vjoanna> i think jhernandez is suggesting having 3 different types of USB labels would be more clear:
2014-07-03T16:37:37 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-03T16:38:32 <vjoanna> 1) with token and inserted 2) with token but not inserted 3) without token but inserted
2014-07-03T16:39:01 <vjoanna> i\'m not sure what the labels would be though
2014-07-03T16:39:04 <jhernandez> I\'ll be ok with just improve the wording of \'active\'
2014-07-03T16:39:28 <danaayotte> i think this is solved by 1) "active" and "inserted" 2) "active" only and 3) "inserted" only
2014-07-03T16:39:40 <danaayotte> (i.e. as we have it now but with better wording)
2014-07-03T16:44:16 <jhernandez> gotta leave now
2014-07-03T16:44:17 <jhernandez> sorry
2014-07-03T16:44:23 <jhernandez> danaayotte and vjoanna
2014-07-03T16:45:06 <vjoanna> okay, thanks for discussing this with us!
2014-07-03T16:45:54 <jhernandez> yeah, I\'ll try to think a little bit more about it
2014-07-03T16:46:03 <jhernandez> thanks!
2014-07-03T16:46:07 <jhernandez> :)

2014-07-03T14:46:42 <slim> colinclark: ping
2014-07-03T14:46:47 <colinclark> SLIM!
2014-07-03T14:46:56 <colinclark> Hey!
2014-07-03T14:47:25 <slim> yay! I\'m looking at GPII-715 - get new tokens working with RFIDlistener
2014-07-03T14:47:32 <slim> There is an example - f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
2014-07-03T14:47:40 <colinclark> Cool
2014-07-03T14:47:42 <slim> how is it encoded?What it it wrutten with?
2014-07-03T14:47:52 <slim> UTf8
2014-07-03T14:48:00 <slim> UTF8?
2014-07-03T14:48:03 <colinclark> That\'s a really good question
2014-07-03T14:48:16 <colinclark> Can you post me a link to where the example is from?
2014-07-03T14:48:23 <slim> if new GoToTags tool it only supports Unicode / UTF8
2014-07-03T14:48:37 <colinclark> interesting
2014-07-03T14:48:48 <slim> how can I find out?
2014-07-03T14:48:58 <colinclark> If I remember, the token generation module, which is probably built into the PMT at the moment, just uses UUIDs
2014-07-03T14:49:06 <colinclark> but I don\'t fully know
2014-07-03T14:49:14 <colinclark> where\'s the example from?
2014-07-03T14:49:27 <slim> dunno just in the bug
2014-07-03T14:49:29 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-03T14:49:52 <slim> can you point me at PMT code?
2014-07-03T14:50:33 <colinclark> lemme look at the bug
2014-07-03T14:50:44 <colinclark> but the PMT is in the prefsEditors repository
2014-07-03T14:50:56 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors
2014-07-03T14:51:17 <colinclark> But I might well be quite confused about where this actually happens
2014-07-03T14:51:40 * clown_mtg is now known as clown
2014-07-03T14:52:13 <colinclark> Justin_o or amilchev, do you know anything about this issue?
2014-07-03T14:52:40 <colinclark> If I remember, we pop up a screen saying "Save this token to your device: <token>"
2014-07-03T14:52:47 <colinclark> how is the token generated?
2014-07-03T14:53:18 <colinclark> Is it just the UUID provided by the preferences server when a new preference set is saved?
2014-07-03T14:53:39 <slim> Also how is it written to Key?
2014-07-03T14:53:44 <slim> s/key/tag
2014-07-03T14:54:12 <colinclark> At the moment, it\'s not done automatically
2014-07-03T14:54:13 <slim> Perhaps cut n paste to GoToTags?
2014-07-03T14:54:17 <colinclark> Yup, exactly
2014-07-03T14:54:18 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-03T14:54:20 <amilchev> colinclark are you asking which component is creating the user token when user presses "save & apply" in PMT? the one shown in a dialog box
2014-07-03T14:54:26 <slim> so whic hversion of GoToTags?
2014-07-03T14:54:29 <colinclark> yep, exactly, amilchev
2014-07-03T14:55:03 <slim> amilchev: my question is the encoding use for the UUID - ASCII or UTF8
2014-07-03T14:55:24 <slim> currently listenr is ASCII woth some hacked UTF8 support whic his porbably the problem
2014-07-03T14:55:46 <colinclark> So slim, if I had to guess, this is the place where tokens are currently being generated: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/userPost.js#L34
2014-07-03T14:55:49 <amilchev> colinclark slim this was implemented by Chris and I\'m not sure what has he done for it
2014-07-03T14:56:02 <colinclark> Okay, thanks amilchev
2014-07-03T14:56:23 <colinclark> Just from a quick search of the code base, my impression is that we\'re saving the preference set, getting back a token from the Preferences Server, and then displaying that
2014-07-03T14:56:37 <colinclark> If that is the case, slim, then the line of code I pasted to you is where this is getting done
2014-07-03T14:56:54 <colinclark> Which means it\'s being generated by this library: https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid
2014-07-03T14:56:55 <jhernandez> slim: colinclark Kostas and me found a problem with gototags, which does something different from the application I am used to write the tags with
2014-07-03T14:57:01 * amilchev has left the channel
2014-07-03T14:57:06 <colinclark> ah, what\'s the difference, jhernandez ?
2014-07-03T14:57:07 <slim> uuid.v4
2014-07-03T14:57:12 <jhernandez> colinclark: not sure
2014-07-03T14:57:28 <slim> arrggg :)
2014-07-03T14:57:28 <jhernandez> probably a utf8 vs ascii thing
2014-07-03T14:57:52 <slim> jhernandez: what tool do you use? I could try it too
2014-07-03T14:58:16 <jhernandez> the point is that I got errors when reading Kostas\' tags, while mine\'s worked in the 3 platforms
2014-07-03T14:58:22 <colinclark> interesting
2014-07-03T14:58:28 <slim> ok
2014-07-03T14:58:28 <jhernandez> slim: I use tagwriter in android
2014-07-03T14:58:45 <colinclark> it\'s so great we\'re all here in this channel :)
2014-07-03T14:58:47 <jhernandez> NXP TagWriter
2014-07-03T14:58:54 <jhernandez> colinclark: heh
2014-07-03T14:59:04 <slim> There are 2 version of GoToTags out in the wild. Latest is UTF8 only for text tags
2014-07-03T14:59:04 <colinclark> It\'s almost like the Woodpecker
2014-07-03T14:59:18 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-07-03T14:59:23 <slim> \\0/ but no Kasper ! :P
2014-07-03T14:59:32 <jhernandez> slim: IMVHO, Go2Tags sucks
2014-07-03T14:59:41 <jhernandez> but hey, it\'s just my humble opinion :P
2014-07-03T15:00:14 <slim> jhernandez: +10000 nasty. hence my wanting to either add write to listener or  out own tool.
2014-07-03T15:00:48 <jhernandez> well, I\'m having a coffee, there we would be drinking beers (or at least, fancy coffees) ;) ;)
2014-07-03T15:00:51 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-07-03T15:01:06 <slim> jhernandez: aslo http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-782
2014-07-03T15:01:53 <slim> ok, thanks guys - conclusion it needs investigating.
2014-07-03T15:02:17 <jhernandez> yeah, I\'ve spent almost all the day figuring out how to address that
2014-07-03T15:03:17 <slim> poo, my Android doesn\'t have NFC so no NXP TagWriter :(
2014-07-03T15:03:26 <jhernandez> heh
2014-07-03T15:04:17 <jhernandez> slim: there should be another apps to write/read nfc on windows
2014-07-03T15:04:54 <slim> jhernandez: yeah! But my Firefox Flame will ahve NFX so I can write an app for that :)
2014-07-03T15:05:03 <slim> *NFC
2014-07-03T15:05:09 <jhernandez> xDDD
2014-07-03T15:05:11 <jhernandez> coool!

2014-07-03T15:17:00 <cindyli> 1. escape key, 2 click anywhere outside the dialog, or both?
2014-07-03T15:17:43 <vjoanna> cindyli: yes, both

2014-07-03T15:52:54 <colinclark> hey jhernandez
2014-07-03T15:53:06 <colinclark> you were asking me in skype about these wireframes: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/advance-gathered-responsetologinissues.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1387405977722&api=v2
2014-07-03T15:53:10 <jhernandez> colinclark: yeah
2014-07-03T15:53:12 <colinclark> Is it cool if we chat about it here?
2014-07-03T15:53:20 <jhernandez> sure
2014-07-03T15:53:33 <colinclark> since vjoanna and danaayotte are ultimately the masterminds behind the wireframes
2014-07-03T15:53:49 <colinclark> You were asking what the "Active" flag means, right?
