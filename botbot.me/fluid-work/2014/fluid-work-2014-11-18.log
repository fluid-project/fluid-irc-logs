b'2014-11-18T17:05:38 <colinclark> it\'s a good question, slim_jim
2014-11-18T17:05:47 <colinclark> I haven\'t actually been to an integration meeting myself
2014-11-18T17:05:53 <colinclark> Michelle tends to go to them
2014-11-18T17:06:12 <colinclark> But my impression is that they\'re really more about general integration, not just about a partiuclar work package
2014-11-18T17:11:34 <Bosmon> colinclark - this tiny pull updates node-jqUnit to current infusion trunk
2014-11-18T17:11:36 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/pull/5
2014-11-18T17:11:42 <colinclark> thanks
2014-11-18T17:14:16 * clown joined the channel
2014-11-18T17:16:46 <Bosmon> colinclark - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/14 is now updated to the latest Infusion and node-jqUnit pull 5
2014-11-18T17:17:54 <colinclark> excellent
2014-11-18T17:19:30 <jhernandez> Bosmon: jqUnit in android is working in the same way as before
2014-11-18T17:19:36 <jhernandez> we get jq: Test concluded - Module "GPII Android Settings" Test name "Running tests for androidSettings node module": 11/11 passed - PASS
2014-11-18T17:19:46 <jhernandez> but after that, nothing else
2014-11-18T17:20:41 <jhernandez> the jq: All tests concluded: 11/11 total passed in 699ms - PASS is lost in the space
2014-11-18T17:21:06 <Bosmon> jhernandez - have you tried with the current trunk of jqunit?
2014-11-18T17:21:25 <Bosmon> simonjb suggested a fix which was necessary on Windows which seems relevant
2014-11-18T17:21:34 <Bosmon> For a case when the end of process output was truncated
2014-11-18T17:21:46 <jhernandez> is the version we\'re pulling with universal?
2014-11-18T17:21:49 <colinclark> Bosmon: Has this pull request been superceded? https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/pull/2
2014-11-18T17:22:05 <Bosmon> colinclark - I was just looking at that one
2014-11-18T17:22:14 <Bosmon> But it\'s not really clear what to do with it
2014-11-18T17:22:16 <Bosmon> Or what it tests
2014-11-18T17:22:41 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-11-18T17:22:45 <Bosmon> jhernandez - the newer version of jqunit is referred to in the "fireball branch" of universal
2014-11-18T17:22:53 <Bosmon> But it is the current trunk of that project
2014-11-18T17:23:07 <Bosmon> It looks like michelled merged in the relevant branch a couple of months ago
2014-11-18T17:23:30 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok - i\'m using our fireball branch of universal
2014-11-18T17:24:57 <jhernandez> ok, later I\'ll try if simonjb\'s pull request fixes the issue for me
2014-11-18T17:25:37 <jhernandez> now I have to run, french classes
2014-11-18T17:26:18 <jhernandez> tty later

2014-11-18T17:52:12 <Justin_o> to make sure they work properly?
2014-11-18T17:52:13 <clown> Justin_o: all three usb sticks worked here.
2014-11-18T17:52:47 <clown> although timothy doesn\'t appear to do much, Justin_o
2014-11-18T17:53:03 <Justin_o> slim_jim: i\'m not having much success with the RFID tags and USBS, also trying with the test urls  for sammy. He logs in, but doesn\'t log out
2014-11-18T17:53:11 <Justin_o> clown: really.. what does it do?
2014-11-18T17:53:18 <clown> which one Justin_o?
2014-11-18T17:53:22 <clown> :-)
2014-11-18T17:53:29 <Justin_o> clown: i guess the most interesting one
2014-11-18T17:53:31 <Justin_o> the best one
2014-11-18T17:53:55 <clown> Justin_o:  carla does a half screen magnfieir with red crosshairs.
2014-11-18T17:53:58 <clown> *magnifier
2014-11-18T17:54:29 <clown> timothy changes the gnome "chrome" to bigger fonts, but nothing changes in the browser (I\'m running FF).
2014-11-18T17:54:42 <Justin_o> clown: okay cool thanks
2014-11-18T17:55:10 <clown> and andre launches Chrome browser, and the top of the window is yellow-on-black, but I can\'t see any other changes.
2014-11-18T17:55:34 <clown> Justin_o:  BTW, I can also login *and* logout sammy.

2014-11-18T20:56:27 <Bosmon> Just looking over your queue implementation
2014-11-18T20:56:50 <Bosmon> What is there seems pretty good - but have we ended up with just a single queue variant now?
2014-11-18T20:58:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: i have a reply for your comment on FLUID-5512 - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5512#comment-25254
2014-11-18T21:00:12 <cindyli> also, noticed the pull request for 5512 was mistakenly using 5521 in title. I\'ve closed that pull request in favor of opening a new one: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/571
2014-11-18T21:00:35 <cindyli> with acorrect jira number :)

2014-11-18T14:59:25 <cindyli> Bosmon2, Justin_o, anastasiac, i created an infusion doc for "common problems encountered with the IoC testing framework" (http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Common+problems+encountered+with+the+IoC+testing+framework). Feel free to make change or add in
2014-11-18T15:00:11 <cindyli> anastasiac: i added this page as a child page of "the IoC testing framework" in the infusion doc wiki site. Do you think if this is the good place for it?
2014-11-18T15:00:52 <cindyli> also, all infusion wiki doc pages, including this one, show a banner of "This documentation is currently being moved to github.
2014-11-18T15:00:52 <cindyli> Please https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/, instead."
2014-11-18T15:01:02 <anastasiac> cindyli, normally, yes, but that space is now the archived, no longer used documentation space. I think we decided yesterday in the channel that it should be in the fluid wiki space
2014-11-18T15:01:58 <cindyli> anastasiac: does "fluid wiki space" mean a regular wiki page rather than inside the infusion documentation?
2014-11-18T15:02:01 <anastasiac> cindyli, maybe we could move it to be a child of this page, instead?
2014-11-18T15:02:06 <anastasiac> yes, regular wiki
2014-11-18T15:02:08 <anastasiac> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Development
2014-11-18T15:02:26 <cindyli> ah. ok. i see. will move it. thanks, anastasiac
2014-11-18T15:11:12 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you think we should have actual documentation in the infusion docs repo for this... we do have a lot of projects using the testing framework now and it does ship with a  full build of infusion
2014-11-18T15:12:15 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I think the discussion yesterday in the channel concluded that the wiki space is where we will start to document these issues, and as information matures and settles down, it can be migrated to official infusion documentation at an appropriate time
2014-11-18T15:12:32 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay. thanks
2014-11-18T15:12:33 <anastasiac> for now, it would probably be a good idea to add a link, in the docs, to this wiki page, Justin_o
2014-11-18T15:13:40 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli, Bosmon2, I\xe2\x80\x99ve renamed the page to \xe2\x80\x9cCommon Problems and Solutions with the IoC testing framework\xe2\x80\x9d - sounds a bit more inviting :-)
2014-11-18T15:26:09 <cindyli> sounds great. thanks, anastasiac

2014-11-18T15:46:22 <Justin_o> colinclark: hello
2014-11-18T15:46:41 <colinclark> What happened with the Windows machine that we were demonstrating with for the Hewlett visit?
2014-11-18T15:47:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: it was needed to create the windows builds for the automation work.. but in the process the boot loader got messed up so you can\'t load windows
2014-11-18T15:47:50 <Justin_o> also the RFID was never setup there, only usb
2014-11-18T15:48:10 <colinclark> oh dear
2014-11-18T15:48:27 <colinclark> We really do need a box that steadily has the GPII on it
2014-11-18T15:49:30 <Justin_o> yes
2014-11-18T15:50:59 <colinclark> The good news is that it should be pretty easy to get a new box up and running
2014-11-18T15:51:07 <colinclark> The documentation isn\'t super clear about it
2014-11-18T15:51:15 <colinclark> but as you\'ve probably seen on the mailing list, there are installers nows
2014-11-18T15:51:21 <colinclark> So if you follow the instructions here: http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment#Using_the_Windows_Installer
2014-11-18T15:51:30 <colinclark> You\'ll see a link to the installer
2014-11-18T15:51:43 <colinclark> and a bit lower down, a link the user listener installer
2014-11-18T15:51:49 <colinclark> install those two, and you should be golden
2014-11-18T15:51:54 <colinclark> You have the RFID reader and rings?

2014-11-18T16:10:38 <colinclark> lemme double check, one sec
2014-11-18T16:10:40 <colinclark> likely in testData

2014-11-18T16:12:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks... so i don\'t have to worry about the win32_installedSolutions.json file, i can just edit installedSolutions.json
2014-11-18T16:12:54 <colinclark> I think that\'s correct
2014-11-18T16:13:02 <colinclark> I\'m not 100% certain of that, but I think so
2014-11-18T16:20:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay.. how do i write to the raid?

2014-11-18T16:21:02 <colinclark> Justin_o: Do you need to?
2014-11-18T16:21:19 <colinclark> There should be several rings with tokens already written on them, no?

2014-11-18T16:21:44 <Justin_o> hmm.. do you know where the are, and do they still work
2014-11-18T16:21:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2014-11-18T16:22:02 <colinclark> Beside the Lenovo desktop?
2014-11-18T16:22:06 <colinclark> I\'m sure I saw them there recently

2014-11-18T16:24:42 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, they were there thanks... i\'ll restart the machine and try them out
2014-11-18T16:27:41 <colinclark> awesome

2014-11-18T16:30:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: do i have to install node separtely
2014-11-18T16:31:07 <Justin_o> i\'m getting an error that windows can\'t find node.exe
2014-11-18T16:31:27 <colinclark> I don\'t know
2014-11-18T16:34:31 <slim_jim> anyone know when Kasper might be around next?
2014-11-18T16:35:49 <slim_jim> Justin_o: when you install node it should be added to the path - I\'ve no idea if Thanos\' MSI does this though.
2014-11-18T16:36:59 <slim_jim> Justin_o: colinclark The win32_installed solutions seems to be obsolete we should remove it if so as it also confused me.
2014-11-18T16:37:42 <slim_jim> Justin_o: the format of the file on RFID has not changed and old rags are supported by newer reader.
2014-11-18T16:37:48 <slim_jim> SO yes they should work in theory

2014-11-18T16:54:40 <colinclark> slim_jim: Cool. I think the rings Justin_o has are the old MiFares that one of Gregg\'s engineering students made
2014-11-18T16:54:51 <colinclark> they are quite funny--like the sort of prize you used to get in a cracker jack box
2014-11-18T16:55:13 <Justin_o> slim_jim: thanks... do you know if node has a specific version requirement
2014-11-18T16:57:22 <Justin_o> under windows still
2014-11-18T16:59:21 <colinclark> Justin_o: I believe the installer is still made off master
2014-11-18T16:59:23 <colinclark> in which case, yes
2014-11-18T16:59:30 <colinclark> it still needs the ancient version of Node
2014-11-18T17:01:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2014-11-18T17:02:12 <cindyli> anytime, Bosmon. any idea when you can have a pull request for the circular instantiation issue? i tried your work around and it works perfectly. I\'m just not so willing to send a GPII request using a infusion lib built from my temp branch.
2014-11-18T17:02:13 <slim_jim> Justin_o: as colinclark  says. Once the fireball branch is merged we can move to the latest node and npm (viva la revolution)
2014-11-18T17:02:26 <colinclark> it should be close
2014-11-18T17:02:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'ll deal with it this afternoon
2014-11-18T17:02:40 <colinclark> i\'m reviewing the last of the prerequisite pull requests today
2014-11-18T17:02:41 <cindyli> super. thanks, Bosmon
2014-11-18T17:03:19 <slim_jim> I see sgithens____ is also working on an installer and hope his work will be merges with Thanos\'s
2014-11-18T17:03:37 <slim_jim> colinclark: \\0/
2014-11-18T17:04:37 <slim_jim> colinclark: do you think I should be in on the integration meetings? I\'m not 100% sure what is covered. More than WP304.5?
