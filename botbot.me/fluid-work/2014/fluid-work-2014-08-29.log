b'2014-08-29T22:48:12 <Bosmon> It seems quite likely that "two listeners in a row", as well as being generally ill-defined, actually isn\'t supported by the framework at all
2014-08-29T22:48:53 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-08-29T22:48:58 <Bosmon> In fact, we have no test cases for it
2014-08-29T22:49:24 <Bosmon> Every test case for the IoC testing framework itself always has an "exec" type in between any two "bind" types
2014-08-29T22:49:27 <cindyli> perhaps i should switch to the old code. at least that is well supported by our framework ;)
2014-08-29T22:49:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - only by accident : P
2014-08-29T22:49:51 <Bosmon> Really what you should do is to combine your sequences points 2 and 3 into a single sequence point
2014-08-29T22:50:03 <Bosmon> Since you aren\'t actually sure in which order they occur
2014-08-29T22:50:16 <cindyli> ok. let me try that
2014-08-29T22:50:18 <Bosmon> In the future I can improve the framework so that it does something more sensible in this case
2014-08-29T22:50:33 <Bosmon> What it should really do is glob together ANY number of consecutive "bind" sequence points
2014-08-29T22:50:38 <Bosmon> And make out of them a single giant boiled event
2014-08-29T22:50:52 <Bosmon> That is, for as many "bind" types it should start to wait for ALL of them to occur, in any sequence
2014-08-29T22:50:58 <Bosmon> But this would be a significant rewrite
2014-08-29T22:51:41 <Bosmon> I\'ll write up a JIRA now....
2014-08-29T22:52:38 <Bosmon> We have this related issue reported by Justin_o
2014-08-29T22:52:39 <Bosmon> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5345
2014-08-29T22:52:55 <Bosmon> And I think then, as now, I asked him to rewrite his test fixture, because it was in theory "invalid"
2014-08-29T22:56:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: i combine those two steps. the test passes in safari and firefox but not chrome. sigh...
2014-08-29T22:56:30 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T22:56:34 <Bosmon> What happens in Chrome?
2014-08-29T22:56:40 <Bosmon> Still a hang, or a failure?
2014-08-29T22:56:56 <Bosmon> It may just be that Chrome has cached the old version
2014-08-29T22:57:03 <Bosmon> It seems very unlikely that there is a nonportability in thie case
2014-08-29T22:57:09 <cindyli> false alarm, cached data. restart and it\'s now ok
2014-08-29T22:57:13 <Bosmon> great
2014-08-29T22:57:26 <Bosmon> Chrome\'s cache has always been much more aggressive than the other browsers
2014-08-29T22:59:00 <cindyli> all tests pass in all three browsers!!! YAY!!!!
2014-08-29T22:59:04 <cindyli> finally!
2014-08-29T23:00:14 <cindyli> pushed up, Bosmon. the pull is ready again. thanks for staying till the midnight
2014-08-29T23:00:24 <cindyli> right at midnight, you tackled this!!
2014-08-29T23:00:30 <cindyli> thanks. see you on Tuesday!
2014-08-29T23:00:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks
2014-08-29T23:00:49 <Bosmon> I have written up http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5502
2014-08-29T23:01:13 <cindyli> "mishandles any case", any?
2014-08-29T23:01:39 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps not quite "any"
2014-08-29T23:01:58 <Bosmon> But I guess I meant to mean that this represents a more general problem than the existing JIRA we had
2014-08-29T23:02:10 <Bosmon> In FLUID-5345
2014-08-29T23:02:19 <cindyli> ok
2014-08-29T23:02:28 <Bosmon> FLUID-5345 only described a problem where the two listeners in a row occurred at the end of the sequence
2014-08-29T23:02:37 <Bosmon> In which case the framework would actually throw, rather than merely hanging
2014-08-29T23:03:52 <cindyli> ok. now you better go to sleep. i feel much relieved going away over the weekend.

2014-08-29T21:27:56 <cindyli1> Bosmon: the pull request for FLOE-195, https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/38, is ready for another look
2014-08-29T21:28:27 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli1
2014-08-29T21:28:30 <Bosmon> You\'re working late :)
2014-08-29T21:28:50 <cindyli1> ha, feeling the pressure ;)
2014-08-29T21:29:06 <cindyli1> just wanna finish this work before I gone for the long weekend
2014-08-29T21:29:15 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T21:29:24 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t include tooltips?
2014-08-29T21:29:46 <cindyli1> no, it doesn\'t unfortunately. and doesn\'t include the model relay
2014-08-29T21:30:06 <cindyli1> refactoring feedback and feedbackLoader taking longer than I expected
2014-08-29T21:30:15 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T21:30:19 <Bosmon> It\'s looking good though
2014-08-29T21:30:23 <Bosmon> All the events are in the right place : P
2014-08-29T21:30:30 <cindyli1> yay!
2014-08-29T21:31:01 <Bosmon> Although you still need to move feedback\'s definitions into its own grade
2014-08-29T21:31:43 <Bosmon> Ah
2014-08-29T21:31:46 <Bosmon> I see most of it is there
2014-08-29T21:32:32 <Bosmon> It\'s a surprising amount of stuff that needs to be configured in place
2014-08-29T21:32:36 <Bosmon> Some of it is templates
2014-08-29T21:32:59 <Bosmon> Well, 3/4 of it is templates
2014-08-29T21:33:02 <Bosmon> And there is one event
2014-08-29T21:33:13 <cindyli1> which part of definitions that you think need to be moved?
2014-08-29T21:33:21 <Bosmon> I\'m puzzled that feedbackLoader is not the same as templateLoader
2014-08-29T21:33:54 <Bosmon> I think you could simplify a lot if this was the case
2014-08-29T21:34:05 <Bosmon> And I believe the idea was that the parent component would be purely responsible for I/O
2014-08-29T21:34:24 <Bosmon> You could then avoid the annoying injection up and down of the events
2014-08-29T21:34:31 <Bosmon> onTemplatesLoaded etc.
2014-08-29T21:35:47 <Bosmon> Well
2014-08-29T21:35:52 <cindyli1> yes, why didn\'t I think of that. let me try that
2014-08-29T21:36:06 <Bosmon> I think you should still go home before the long weekend : P
2014-08-29T21:36:58 <cindyli1> i\'m working from home today. ha, smart :)

2014-08-29T22:02:29 <cindyli1> ok. i don\'t wanna bug u if it\'s too late
2014-08-29T22:02:59 <Bosmon> no, it\'s fine
2014-08-29T22:03:01 <cindyli1> i move some logic out of bindButton into a model listener for "isActive", then a unit test for bindDialog fails
2014-08-29T22:03:06 <Bosmon> If you can work late, I can : P
2014-08-29T22:03:18 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T22:03:21 <cindyli1> so nice of you ;)
2014-08-29T22:03:33 <cindyli1> the modelChange event is not received in the testing framework
2014-08-29T22:03:39 <Bosmon> Did you deal with recombining templateLoader and feedbackLoader already?
2014-08-29T22:03:47 <cindyli1> yes, and pushed up already
2014-08-29T22:03:53 <Bosmon> wow, so quick
2014-08-29T22:04:00 <cindyli1> that part seems working fine
2014-08-29T22:04:05 <cindyli1> it\'s a simple change
2014-08-29T22:04:19 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2014-08-29T22:04:20 <cindyli1> the weird thing is with bindDialogTests.js
2014-08-29T22:04:23 <Bosmon> Looks much simplified now, great
2014-08-29T22:04:38 <Bosmon> And the only bindings are on to things one would expect
2014-08-29T22:04:42 <Bosmon> That is, the templates
2014-08-29T22:04:42 <cindyli1> it fails and i don\'t know why my change would cause that failure
2014-08-29T22:04:45 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T22:05:20 <cindyli1> i mean the change in the bindButton() in bindDialog.js
2014-08-29T22:06:03 * Justin_o has quit
2014-08-29T22:07:10 <Bosmon> ok, let me check out and look
2014-08-29T22:07:46 <cindyli1> thanks, i keep looking too
2014-08-29T22:08:59 <Bosmon> ok cindyli1
2014-08-29T22:09:01 <Bosmon> So I see the test hang
2014-08-29T22:09:07 <Bosmon> I also see my new diagnostic in the console :)
2014-08-29T22:09:08 <cindyli1> yes
2014-08-29T22:09:21 <Bosmon> Very satisfying....
2014-08-29T22:09:23 <Bosmon> "23:09:17.597:
2014-08-29T22:09:23 <Bosmon> Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 3 of 10 sequence element Object { listenerMaker="gpii.tests.bindDialog.makeChangeChecker", makerArgs=[3], spec={...}, more...} of fixture Mouse Interaction"
2014-08-29T22:09:29 <cindyli1> exactly :)
2014-08-29T22:09:44 <cindyli1> very helpful
2014-08-29T22:12:06 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2014-08-29T22:14:11 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - what was the change you made?
2014-08-29T22:14:39 <cindyli1> i added one more model listener for isActive - controlDialogState
2014-08-29T22:15:10 <cindyli1> the logic in controlDialogState() was in bindButton before
2014-08-29T22:15:42 <cindyli1> https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/commit/cb82ec2ab71e2ec3f35c6cc79e3fafd8560c87a6
2014-08-29T22:23:30 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T22:23:42 <Bosmon> So, for some reason, only the implementation\'s own change listeners are registered
2014-08-29T22:23:53 <Bosmon> And the IoC framework\'s one isn\'t
2014-08-29T22:24:18 <Bosmon> For reference, a very helpful point for breakpoints in the new ChangeApplier is fluid.model.notifyExternal
2014-08-29T22:24:28 <Bosmon> Which in your build is at line 23063
2014-08-29T22:25:09 <Bosmon> You can then also step back one step to "concludeTransaction"
2014-08-29T22:25:19 <Bosmon> In which you can see the complete set of listeners inside the applier
2014-08-29T22:25:28 <Bosmon> at applier.changeListeners.transListeners
2014-08-29T22:25:37 <Bosmon> And it seems that the IoC framework\'s one simply doesn\'t appear
2014-08-29T22:25:43 <Bosmon> So this is starting to look like a framework bug
2014-08-29T22:27:18 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-08-29T22:27:18 * cindyli1 has quit
2014-08-29T22:27:25 <cindyli> a useful break point
2014-08-29T22:28:37 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T22:28:51 <Bosmon> So actually I am thinking that the "helpful diagnostic" was not so helpful this time
2014-08-29T22:29:02 <Bosmon> Since I believe that the framework is actually blocked on sequence point 2 rather than 3
2014-08-29T22:29:15 <Bosmon> Unfortunately in the case of "two listeners in a row" it gets 1 step ahead of itself
2014-08-29T22:29:50 <cindyli> ha
2014-08-29T22:30:38 <Bosmon> No, this doesn\'t seem to be correct...
2014-08-29T22:30:45 <Bosmon> Sequence point 2 has indeed been passed
2014-08-29T22:30:59 <Bosmon> So back to the idea that there is a framework bug, which I guess we can now better characterise
2014-08-29T22:31:29 <Bosmon> I remember that the "two listeners in a row" case has often been problematic
2014-08-29T22:31:53 <Bosmon> The way that the IoC testing framework is implemented, is in terms of looking at the type of pairs of adjacent fixtures
2014-08-29T22:31:55 <cindyli> the step 2 seems fine, it passes
2014-08-29T22:31:58 <Bosmon> So there are 4 different kinds of cases
2014-08-29T22:32:10 <Bosmon> Which means that bugs can possibly afflict each kind of pair separately
2014-08-29T22:32:39 <Bosmon> That is, there are two kinds of sequence points, "exec" and "bind", corresponding to active and passive fixtures
2014-08-29T22:32:48 <Bosmon> That is, ones that trigger some action, and those that wait for some action
2014-08-29T22:33:11 <Bosmon> It seems possible that the framework is mishandling pairs that look like "bind, bind"
2014-08-29T22:33:27 <cindyli> ah.
2014-08-29T22:33:58 <Bosmon> Although it must be something subtle since we have quite a lot of these around the place
2014-08-29T22:34:05 <cindyli> the step 2 has problem too. replacing listenerMaker with listener helps
2014-08-29T22:34:32 <cindyli> maybe first of all i should get rid of listenerMakers for events
2014-08-29T22:35:56 <cindyli> no, i was wrong, listenerMaker was ok at step 2.
2014-08-29T22:37:02 <Bosmon> It shouldn\'t make a difference
2014-08-29T22:37:07 <Bosmon> Other than increasing the clarity of the code
2014-08-29T22:37:16 <cindyli> u r right
2014-08-29T22:37:18 <Bosmon> I wish I had not written this implementation "in a functional style"
2014-08-29T22:37:27 <Bosmon> It shows how appalling hard to debug functional code is
2014-08-29T22:38:13 <cindyli> let me replace as many listenerMaker with listener to make ur debug work easier
2014-08-29T22:39:41 <cindyli> but cannot do much for changeEvent
2014-08-29T22:39:54 <Bosmon> It\'s ok
2014-08-29T22:40:01 <Bosmon> I think it is relatively clear that this is my bug rather than yours
2014-08-29T22:40:14 <Bosmon> The crucial line is line 500 of IoCTestUtils.js
2014-08-29T22:40:25 <Bosmon> Which is responsible for coordinating this case
2014-08-29T22:40:50 <Bosmon> I can\'t say I can particularly understand what is wrong with it
2014-08-29T22:41:04 <Bosmon> But it might be something to do with the fact that the 2nd listener now resolves asynchronously
2014-08-29T22:41:26 <Bosmon> You can probably go home safely, and I will have a pull request waiting for you when you come in on Tuesday : P
2014-08-29T22:42:32 <Bosmon> oh
2014-08-29T22:42:47 <Bosmon> I think I am dimly starting to have an idea what the issue is
2014-08-29T22:42:59 <cindyli> super!
2014-08-29T22:43:11 <Bosmon> I guess it is actually a little unusual to have "two listeners in a row" in any case
2014-08-29T22:43:25 <Bosmon> Normally this is actually a bug
2014-08-29T22:43:33 <Bosmon> Because you couldn\'t be sure which would be notified first
2014-08-29T22:43:51 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s not "normally" a bug
2014-08-29T22:43:54 <cindyli> btw, Bosmon, i also replaced listenerMaker with listener in that file and pushed up, but it may not help much because most listenerMakers are for change event. those still stay there
2014-08-29T22:44:05 <Bosmon> But it often was when Justin_o did it, since he often did it to different listeners to the same event
2014-08-29T22:44:22 <Bosmon> But I think your case is sound since there is a definite sequence to the events
2014-08-29T22:44:49 <Bosmon> oh wait
2014-08-29T22:44:52 <Bosmon> Perhaps there isn\'t
2014-08-29T22:45:19 <Bosmon> So why, in fact, should the change event resolve AFTER the dialog rendering?
2014-08-29T22:45:25 <Bosmon> it seems that it should actually be the other way round
2014-08-29T22:45:33 <Bosmon> And in general, the sequence isn\'t really well-defined
2014-08-29T22:45:56 <Bosmon> All you could say is that these fixtures should occur "at roughly the same time"
2014-08-29T22:46:02 <cindyli> right
2014-08-29T22:46:54 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T22:47:00 <Bosmon> Well, I reversed the order, and it still fails
2014-08-29T22:47:06 <cindyli> i tried that too
2014-08-29T22:47:09 <Bosmon> But I think this suggests what has always happened in this case
2014-08-29T22:47:12 <cindyli> they all chained together
2014-08-29T22:47:20 <Bosmon> In that, someone has come to me, and said, "this sequence doesn\'t work"
2014-08-29T22:47:30 <Bosmon> And usually I have said, "actually it is invalid, since the sequence isn\'t well-defined"
2014-08-29T22:47:34 <Bosmon> And so they have just rewritten it
2014-08-29T22:47:45 <Bosmon> But this I think has always obscured the fact that the framework actually mishandles this case

b'2014-08-29T15:50:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool!
2014-08-29T15:51:05 <anastasiac> jhung, I think this is good to go for now. I think we should get it into the epub and make sure it works there, then focus on the write-up
2014-08-29T15:51:08 <jhung> anastasiac: which repo did you update - just the simulation?
2014-08-29T15:51:21 <jhung> Sounds good anastasiac.
2014-08-29T15:51:21 <anastasiac> jhung, just the forces-and-motion one
2014-08-29T15:51:26 <jhung> ok
2014-08-29T15:51:42 <anastasiac> jhung, do you want me to update the script in the epub?
2014-08-29T15:52:03 <jhung> Yes anastasiac if you can.
2014-08-29T15:52:11 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a try...
2014-08-29T15:53:08 <anastasiac> michelled: phet sim working via keyboard! ^
2014-08-29T15:53:24 <jhung> anastasiac: I just tried the simulation - it looks good.
2014-08-29T15:53:29 <anastasiac> indeed
2014-08-29T15:53:38 <jhung> anastasiac: however, before we update the script in the epub...
2014-08-29T15:54:01 <jhung> we should get the simulation to load directly into the tug-of-war, and to enable accessibility by default.
2014-08-29T15:54:30 <anastasiac> right, since there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a command line to put parameters on. good memory, jhung
2014-08-29T15:54:56 <jhung> :)
2014-08-29T15:56:41 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-08-29T15:56:54 <michelled> anastasiac: awesome!
2014-08-29T15:56:57 <michelled> this is wonderful
2014-08-29T16:04:22 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think we need to get rid of this "partner" business : P
2014-08-29T16:04:45 <Bosmon> What does it mean, in fact?
2014-08-29T16:06:08 <cindyli> Bosmon: if someone click mismatch button and input some feedback, the mismatch dialog model will look like {isActive: true, [and user feedback]}
2014-08-29T16:06:52 <cindyli> this guy then click match button, we need: 1. set match dialog model isActive to true
2014-08-29T16:07:06 <cindyli> 2. reset mismatch dialog isActive to false
2014-08-29T16:07:22 <cindyli> 3. reset all the user feedback to falsy values
2014-08-29T16:08:06 <cindyli> 4. update the top collection {feedback}.model.userData to {match: true, mismatch: false, [and all falsy values for user feedback]}
2014-08-29T16:08:18 <cindyli> right now, step 4 is done via model relay
2014-08-29T16:08:47 <cindyli> when all 4 steps are done, a save call should be made to the database
2014-08-29T16:09:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - it appears that we can manage the isActive flags via modelRelay too
2014-08-29T16:09:18 <Bosmon> And we should
2014-08-29T16:09:51 <jhung> anastasiac: I re-opened FLOE-217 http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-217
2014-08-29T16:09:55 <cindyli> can we have model relay listening to multiple source models?
2014-08-29T16:09:56 <jhung> For the scripting work.
2014-08-29T16:10:08 <Bosmon> cindyli - we can write as many relay rules as we like
2014-08-29T16:10:15 <Bosmon> As long as they don\'t try to bring about contradictory results : P
2014-08-29T16:10:19 <anastasiac> jhung, thanks, I was just about to check which JIRA it was. Great minds think alike...
2014-08-29T16:11:33 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you mean using model relay in btw two isActives?
2014-08-29T16:11:42 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2014-08-29T16:11:46 <cindyli> ok
2014-08-29T16:11:48 <Bosmon> But not between them
2014-08-29T16:11:59 <Bosmon> Just onto all the other flags that we have that duplicate their state
2014-08-29T16:12:27 <jhung> anastasiac: as long as we don\'t start completing each other\'s sentences, I think we\'ll be okay. :D
2014-08-29T16:19:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - what did you find about the preventDefault effect?
2014-08-29T16:20:52 <cindyli> Bosmon: we still need it happen before invokeLater to prevent the url redirection to its href which is "#"
2014-08-29T16:20:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - so there was a bug before?
2014-08-29T16:21:09 <cindyli> yes, you found it, Bosmon!
2014-08-29T16:21:13 <Bosmon> ok cool
2014-08-29T16:21:55 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2014-08-29T16:21:55 * cindyli has quit
2014-08-29T16:22:29 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-29T16:26:14 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - so what actually is "partner"?
2014-08-29T16:26:51 <cindyli1> Bosmon: the partner of the match dialog is the mismatch dialog, vice versus
2014-08-29T16:27:09 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - I think they need to be named explictly
2014-08-29T16:27:23 <Bosmon> What will you name them when there are 3 participants in the system :)
2014-08-29T16:27:44 <Bosmon> But yes, all of this should be mediated by the model
2014-08-29T16:27:53 <Bosmon> You shouldn\'t be passing instances of one dialog to functions processing the other
2014-08-29T16:30:28 <cindyli1> ok. need to think about how to do this relay
2014-08-29T16:34:55 <cindyli1> Bosmon: i have a question regarding this comment - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/38/files#r16867695
2014-08-29T16:35:23 <cindyli1> do you mean to move those events from feedbackLoader to its subcomponent feedback?
2014-08-29T16:35:53 <cindyli1> how can we listener to those events in the IoC testing framework when we test feedbackLoader
2014-08-29T16:36:22 <cindyli1> or we only test feedbackLoader on template loading and test those events with "feedback" component?
2014-08-29T16:38:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how do i use the object syntax for message keys with the renderer
2014-08-29T16:39:19 <Justin_o> i want "something %token" as the string template instead of "something {0}"
2014-08-29T17:34:27 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - yes, the events should be moved down to the implementation component
2014-08-29T17:34:30 <Bosmon> The loader is just a loader
2014-08-29T17:35:27 <cindyli1> ok
2014-08-29T17:35:56 * anastasiac has quit
2014-08-29T17:36:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can control rendering messages using the "messageResolver"
2014-08-29T17:36:40 <Bosmon> In particular there\'s a function argument messageResolverFunction to the renderer
2014-08-29T17:36:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry.. i forgot to mention i got it working.. i had the args as [{token: value}] but needed just {token: value}
2014-08-29T17:36:49 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T17:37:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: have we come up with a way of converting the page language to the full name.. e.g. en to English?
2014-08-29T17:38:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i can find the page language with document.documentElement.lang
2014-08-29T17:39:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I didn\'t know about that property
2014-08-29T17:39:12 <Bosmon> I imagine we would have to have our own lookup table
2014-08-29T17:39:19 <Justin_o> it returns en if the page was in english
2014-08-29T17:39:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. that\'s what i though
2014-08-29T17:39:27 <Justin_o> thought
2014-08-29T17:55:00 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli1 - michelled and I are talking about features for the demo
2014-08-29T17:55:32 <Bosmon> I was thinking that if you think it is slowing you down getting new features implemented, you could skip dealing with this code review for now if it meant you could turn to other things
2014-08-29T17:55:44 <Bosmon> For example, the model relay for the dialog flags could be pushed out until after the demo
2014-08-29T17:56:05 <Bosmon> I think you should be able to deal with moving the events onto the implementation component relatively easily
2014-08-29T17:56:07 <Bosmon> What do you think?
2014-08-29T17:56:16 <cindyli1> ok, i see. yes, i\'m working on the model relay right now
2014-08-29T17:56:20 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T17:56:25 <Bosmon> Well, see what you think
2014-08-29T17:56:25 <cindyli1> ok, will do that first
2014-08-29T17:56:37 <cindyli1> i mean "moving events"
2014-08-29T17:56:51 <Bosmon> What features would you work on next?
2014-08-29T17:56:55 <Bosmon> If there weren\'t this review
2014-08-29T17:57:16 <cindyli1> this is the next - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-226
2014-08-29T17:57:32 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2014-08-29T17:57:35 <Bosmon> That isn\'t a feature JIRA either
2014-08-29T17:57:56 <Bosmon> Is there something we might do to make the demo more featureful if we weren\'t improving the implementation?
2014-08-29T17:57:59 <Bosmon> michelled?
2014-08-29T17:58:35 <cindyli1> no, but 226 will fix the issue that two tooltips, or one dialog plus one tooltip, sometimes show at the same time
2014-08-29T17:58:41 <Bosmon> oh ok
2014-08-29T17:59:08 <michelled> FLOE-195, FLOE-196 and FLOE-223 are the feature ones
2014-08-29T17:59:30 <michelled> that should come before FLOE-226 and FLOE-227
2014-08-29T17:59:40 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T17:59:52 <michelled> this listing on this page is in order of priority: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2014-08-29T18:00:25 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T18:00:36 <Bosmon> Will FLOE-226 enable support for FLOE-223?
2014-08-29T18:00:48 <Bosmon> Do we have some tooltips already, although buggy?
2014-08-29T18:01:04 <cindyli1> 195 is under review, Justin_o is working on 196. yesterday, Justin_o and I were talking about which one we should work on first, 223 or 226, we thought it\'s better to work on 226 first to fix that bug. we are open to switch to work on 223 first :)
2014-08-29T18:01:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think we should do FLOE-226 before 223
2014-08-29T18:01:15 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-29T18:01:24 <Bosmon> Which day is the demo itself?
2014-08-29T18:01:30 <Justin_o> Friday
2014-08-29T18:01:50 <Justin_o> but we are planning on stopping work by the community meeting on wednesday and monday is a holiday
2014-08-29T18:01:54 <Bosmon> yes
2014-08-29T18:02:13 <Bosmon> It sounds like FLOE-226 could be split into the dialog work and the tooltip work
2014-08-29T18:02:19 <Bosmon> Only the latter of which is crucial for new functionality
2014-08-29T18:02:24 <Bosmon> That might speed things up a bit
2014-08-29T18:02:46 <Bosmon> And I already put support for "multi-homing" tooltips into our tooltip wrapper, so in theory that would be relatively easy
2014-08-29T18:03:30 <Bosmon> So we would at least then solve the issue of two tooltips displaying at the same time
2014-08-29T18:03:48 <Bosmon> And it sounds like, as written, 226 wouldn\'t necessarily solve the issue of a tooltip and a dialog appearing at the same time in any case
2014-08-29T18:03:58 <cindyli1> agree
2014-08-29T18:04:07 <Justin_o> cindyli1, michelled, Bosmon: what do you think about not supporting the language part of the requests dialog right now.. from the current first pass designs it is supposed to come from the page... since the demo will only be in english anyways, I\'m not sure it\'s worth developing the code for
2014-08-29T18:04:30 <Justin_o> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/37855787/metadata-feedback.pdf
2014-08-29T18:04:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sounds reasonable, especially if it conforms to the designs we currently have
2014-08-29T18:05:00 <Bosmon> So let us push out i) model relay for dialog flags, and ii) one dialog component work until after the demo
2014-08-29T18:05:09 <Bosmon> And before then we can concentrate on tooltips for 223 and 226
2014-08-29T18:05:12 <Bosmon> How does that sound?
2014-08-29T18:05:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the first pass designs say English and it\'s supposed to pick up the pages language... the future designs will be user driven for the language
2014-08-29T18:05:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that sounds good
2014-08-29T18:05:52 <cindyli1> +1
2014-08-29T18:06:06 <Bosmon> I\'m trying to find the API page for our tooltip component
2014-08-29T18:06:13 <Bosmon> But I\'m beginning to suspect I didn\'t write one :(
2014-08-29T18:06:57 <Bosmon> oh yes
2014-08-29T18:06:59 <Bosmon> Just a broken link
2014-08-29T18:07:01 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry :(
2014-08-29T18:09:27 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - you\'ll have to consult the test cases
2014-08-29T18:09:33 <Bosmon> The relevant one is the "tooltip delegate tests"
2014-08-29T18:09:33 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/component-tests/tooltip/js/TooltipTests.js#L89
2014-08-29T18:10:05 <Bosmon> All you need to do is supply a structure like this which maps the id of the relevant DOM element onto the content which should be displayed when the tooltip shows for that element
2014-08-29T18:10:28 <cindyli1> ok. sounds easy. thanks.

2014-08-29T13:26:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: are the best docs for model transformations still on the gpii wiki?
2014-08-29T13:27:14 <cindyli> Justin_o: yes, i think so, but don\'t rmb why we stopped converting it to fluid project wiki
2014-08-29T13:27:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay... one more question
2014-08-29T13:28:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: from the pouchDB datasource we get the results of the view for collecting the requests and votes like [{key="transcripts", value=1}, {key="text", value=2}]
2014-08-29T13:28:53 <Justin_o> but we probably want this more like {transcripts: 1, text: 2}
2014-08-29T13:29:07 <Justin_o> should i do this change with a model transform or just loop over the array
2014-08-29T13:29:14 <Justin_o> we don\'t need to convert back every
2014-08-29T13:29:16 <Justin_o> ever
2014-08-29T13:32:00 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think we should use model transformation if the array loop is already built in there.
2014-08-29T13:32:36 <cindyli> feels like fluid.transforms.arrayToObject can handle it

2014-08-29T13:49:58 <Justin_o> cindyli: i haven\'t been able to get it to work :( maybe you can see what I\'m doing wrong. I even just took the example

2014-08-29T13:50:27 <cindyli> sure
2014-08-29T13:50:28 <Justin_o> the transform there should be transformation. I forgot to change that
2014-08-29T13:50:46 <Justin_o> in the call to fluid.model.transform
2014-08-29T13:51:09 <cindyli> man, your variable is transformation, and the last line u r using **transform** as the 2nd arg
2014-08-29T13:52:11 <cindyli> still returning empty object tho. more ..
2014-08-29T13:53:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes i just get an empty object
2014-08-29T13:55:13 <cindyli> Justin_o: now it works - http://pastebin.com/eg00eVkP
2014-08-29T13:56:06 <cindyli> the difference is to add line 2
2014-08-29T13:57:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. i don\'t want "value" to show up in the result though, but i can play around with it and see what i can do
2014-08-29T13:58:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: used an outputPath option instead of the value key and it worked
2014-08-29T13:58:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for the help
2014-08-29T13:58:43 <cindyli> np. good you figured out
2014-08-29T14:15:39 <anastasiac> Justin_o, michelled: I\xe2\x80\x99m fixing some broken links on the fluidproject.org site (http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/). I guess I should also update it to reference 1.5 instead of 1.4, no? And the links to demos: Where should that point? build.fluidproject.org is not 1.5, it\xe2\x80\x99s master, right?
2014-08-29T14:16:49 <michelled> yes, master
2014-08-29T14:17:58 <anastasiac> do we have a place to send people to see 1.5 demos? or do we want to do that?
2014-08-29T14:18:12 <anastasiac> and for \xe2\x80\x9cdownload infusion!\xe2\x80\x9d I guess point to the github releases page?
2014-08-29T14:18:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that won\'t contain the infusion-all file though
2014-08-29T14:19:06 <anastasiac> no, but it contains instructions for building it, right?
2014-08-29T14:19:18 <anastasiac> do we have something people can download to get the infusion-all file?
2014-08-29T14:19:52 <anastasiac> are we still using the builder?
2014-08-29T14:20:05 <anastasiac> the builder doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be up
2014-08-29T14:26:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: no builder anymore, only the grunt task
2014-08-29T14:26:48 <anastasiac> so if there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to get the infusion-all file except to download the code from github and build it yourself, then any download links should point to github, no?
2014-08-29T14:41:44 * clown1 joined the channel
2014-08-29T14:42:53 * clown has quit
2014-08-29T14:43:04 * clown1 is now known as clown
2014-08-29T14:50:29 <Justin_o> anastasiac: or we could build something and put it up somewhere
2014-08-29T14:50:54 <Justin_o> if we just use the github links we should make sure that we mention that a build step is required
2014-08-29T14:51:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: are you available for a renderer question?
2014-08-29T14:51:11 <anastasiac> well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to point it at github for now, with instructions; that\xe2\x80\x99s better than pointing at the 1.4 release bundle!
2014-08-29T14:51:23 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s true
2014-08-29T14:52:23 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2014-08-29T14:52:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2014-08-29T14:52:28 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2014-08-29T14:55:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-08-29T14:55:59 <Justin_o> so i have a model that looks like {user: {}, requests: {text: 1, transcript: 2, audioDesc: 1}}
2014-08-29T14:56:18 <Justin_o> i want to render the requests, the user portion will be needed to render votes later but I haven\'t gotten that far yet
2014-08-29T14:56:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  you can see the designs here http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/37855787/metadata-feedback.pdf
2014-08-29T14:56:49 <Justin_o> the requests will render something like
2014-08-29T14:57:04 <Justin_o> Transcripts: English     1  +1
2014-08-29T14:57:10 <Justin_o> where +1 is a vote button
2014-08-29T14:57:17 <Justin_o> so you can see i have to do some translation to get the name
2014-08-29T14:57:42 <Justin_o> I\'m trying to use a the repeat renderer expander
2014-08-29T14:57:59 <Justin_o> but all i can seem to get is the value, which in this case is the number of requests for each request
2014-08-29T14:58:21 <Justin_o> i also want to get the request key to use as a look up into something
2014-08-29T14:58:48 <Justin_o> and it will probably also be needed for the voting as well later
2014-08-29T14:58:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any thoughts
2014-08-29T14:58:55 <Justin_o> ?
2014-08-29T14:58:56 * cindyli has quit
2014-08-29T14:59:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the expander does export the key as part of the "pathAs" variable
2014-08-29T14:59:52 <Bosmon> But this doesn\'t look like it is in a form which is very helpful to you
2014-08-29T15:00:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it might be better in this case to write your own produceTree function
2014-08-29T15:00:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay thanks.. i thought that might be the case but wanted to check first
2014-08-29T15:00:32 <Bosmon> cool

2014-08-29T15:32:31 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: stand-up?
2014-08-29T15:32:37 <cindyli> right
2014-08-29T15:43:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m having some problems with my produceTree function
2014-08-29T15:43:56 <Justin_o> so far it\'s simple and just creates and returns this tree
2014-08-29T15:43:58 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CGCnsVWM
2014-08-29T15:44:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: however i keep gettings this error
2014-08-29T15:44:23 <Justin_o> ASSERTION FAILED: Illegal cond->cond transition
2014-08-29T15:44:43 <Justin_o> header is a valid selector
2014-08-29T15:44:57 <Justin_o> i also tried using messagekey instead of value, which is what I\'d really prefer to do here
2014-08-29T15:45:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you\'ve probably forgotten to disable the expander
2014-08-29T15:45:38 <Bosmon> Since you have written a "full tree" here
2014-08-29T15:45:56 <Bosmon> And by default the output of the produceTree function is expected to be a protocomponent tree
2014-08-29T15:47:40 <anastasiac> jhung, the change that Sam pushed to the forces and motions simulation last night works! yay! You can set up and activate the simulation by keyboard!
2014-08-29T15:48:22 <Bosmon> anastasiac - cool - can I see the diff?
2014-08-29T15:48:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah right i have forgotten about that
2014-08-29T15:49:14 <anastasiac> jhung, if you pull down the forces and motion repo from master now, it works - when you tab through, enter will move pullers to the rope, and continuing to tab will land you on the go button, and you can hit enter to start/pause the pulling!
2014-08-29T15:49:21 <anastasiac> the reset button doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be in the tab order
2014-08-29T15:49:27 <anastasiac> but this is a big improvement!
2014-08-29T15:49:39 <anastasiac> this is good to go!
2014-08-29T15:50:03 <jhung> that\'s great news anastasiac. I\'ll take a look but it sounds like it\'s almost ready to go
2014-08-29T15:50:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: adding noExpand: true in the rendererFnOptions fixed it, thanks
