2014-03-12T21:00:58 <Justin_o> colinclark: just saw that comment.. it does sort of work with any.. it really just ties into github
2014-03-12T21:01:14 <colinclark> cool
2014-03-12T21:01:28 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: could one or both of you please update the node.js and the extension criteria http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Static+Site+Generators+Research
2014-03-12T21:01:30 <colinclark> I think I might prefer hosting our own static sites
2014-03-12T21:01:31 <colinclark> rather than putting them on Github
2014-03-12T21:01:33 <colinclark> but I\'m not sure
2014-03-12T21:01:39 <colinclark> I\'ll try to write something right now, Justin_o
2014-03-12T21:01:53 <colinclark> Certainly I want a Github-backed workflow
2014-03-12T21:02:02 <colinclark> but somehow I was just deeply uninspired by Github Pages
2014-03-12T21:02:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, and in regards to the github integration for prose it\'s just for hosting the markdown files.. the site doesn\'t have to be hosted on github
2014-03-12T21:02:23 <colinclark> given how simple it is for us to maintain VMs that contain an instance of nginx and a directory full of static files
2014-03-12T21:02:39 <colinclark> i.e. even I am capable of taking self-responsibility for a site like that
2014-03-12T21:03:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes.. it really is just a github backed workflow you can use web hooks or whatever to trigger the generation on your own hosted site
2014-03-12T21:03:00 <colinclark> were avtar to have created the VM recipe for me and made it available on the Nebula dashboard
2014-03-12T21:03:12 <Justin_o> it just abstracts away some of the git bits for people
2014-03-12T21:03:15 <colinclark> I\'m still really happy with the Flocking site, as simple as it is
2014-03-12T21:03:22 <colinclark> every time I commit, it just updates the site

2014-03-12T21:28:54 <jessm> Justin_o: i just updated your wiki page for static sites with a go-ahead from JT to decommision the wiki.inclusivedesign.ca site with some caveats
2014-03-12T21:36:04 <colinclark> Justin_o: I just updated it too
2014-03-12T21:36:20 <colinclark> with two criteria--one about extensibility and one about "less intrusive templating"
2014-03-12T21:36:30 <colinclark> I tried to be specific about why I think these issues are worthwhile
2014-03-12T21:37:28 <colinclark> Bosmon: Feel free to add any other details or more specific criteria
2014-03-12T21:37:39 * anastasiac has quit
2014-03-12T21:37:40 <colinclark> I like Justin_o\'s suggestion that we be very clear about why want a feature
2014-03-12T21:37:48 <colinclark> i.e. examples or whatever else we can think of
2014-03-12T21:37:52 <colinclark> so we don\'t forget later
2014-03-12T21:41:08 <colinclark> I just added a somewhat vague criteria about workflow with Git and our cloud
2014-03-12T21:41:14 <colinclark> perhaps Avtar will have more tangible details
2014-03-12T21:41:17 <colinclark> or maybe it\'s just obvious
2014-03-12T21:41:19 <colinclark> I don\'t know

2014-03-12T18:31:04 <Justin_o> specifically we\'ll be establishing a set of criteria for which to base our research on

2014-03-12T18:42:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks
2014-03-12T18:42:36 <Bosmon> Yes, please dial me in
2014-03-12T18:44:11 <Justin_o> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Static+Site+Generators+Research
2014-03-12T18:44:49 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-03-12T18:46:38 <colinclark> Justin_o: I\'m not sure exactly what the criteria of being a criteria exactly is
2014-03-12T18:46:54 <colinclark> but I\'m particularly interested in seeing us find a solution, in the short term, for making awesome documentation
2014-03-12T18:46:55 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2014-03-12T18:46:59 <colinclark> with a static site generator
2014-03-12T18:47:24 <colinclark> I also have this vague sense that a static site generator could be a good friend for us
2014-03-12T18:47:37 <colinclark> i.e. a thing we\'ll use to build lots of different types of simple web infrastructure
2014-03-12T18:47:58 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-03-12T18:48:03 <colinclark> So within reason, I\'m interested in things like ease of integration with Infusion
2014-03-12T18:48:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: you mean for things that are generated or the generator itself?
2014-03-12T18:48:34 <colinclark> hmm
2014-03-12T18:48:37 <colinclark> that\'s an interesting question
2014-03-12T18:48:43 <colinclark> I don\'t know if I fully understand the difference
2014-03-12T18:48:52 <colinclark> what sort of thing are you thinking about?
2014-03-12T18:49:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: do you mean the site that is generated should be able to run infusion, or we should be able to use infusion to do the generation step?
2014-03-12T18:49:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m just trying to understand what "integration with infusion" means
2014-03-12T18:50:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I added a criterion to our list to reflect this
2014-03-12T18:50:16 <colinclark> I guess in a way they\'re sort of iterations of the same thing
2014-03-12T18:50:22 <colinclark> or a "spectrum"
2014-03-12T18:50:26 <Bosmon> But I believe colinclark means integration in both directions
2014-03-12T18:50:35 <colinclark> for sure
2014-03-12T18:50:50 <Bosmon> The generation process might require infusion, but we certainly require the ability to directly and easily host infusion content in the generated site
2014-03-12T18:52:01 * avtar joined the channel
2014-03-12T18:52:18 <colinclark> I can imagine that there will be cases where want some new feature in a site
2014-03-12T18:52:38 <colinclark> and in the old model of CMSes, we might go out and look for some "plugin" or "module"
2014-03-12T18:52:47 <colinclark> in the case of a static site generator, I imagine we have a bit more flexibility
2014-03-12T18:53:01 <colinclark> including, say, rolling an Infusion component to do some feature, etc.
2014-03-12T18:53:05 <colinclark> if that is making any sense
2014-03-12T18:53:14 <Bosmon> yes
2014-03-12T18:53:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: can you guys add the criteria and the reason to the wiki page.. and we can discuss it further in the meeting
2014-03-12T18:53:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it is item 3 on the list

2014-03-12T18:57:26 <Justin_o> http://ci.openstack.org
2014-03-12T18:58:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  okay i think i see it now, wasn\'t what i was expecting :)
2014-03-12T19:05:01 <avtar> fluid-everyone: http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/june/25/prose-a-content-editor-for-github/
2014-03-12T19:06:12 <colinclark> Why can\'t people make things like this content editor that can work with any site generator? :)
