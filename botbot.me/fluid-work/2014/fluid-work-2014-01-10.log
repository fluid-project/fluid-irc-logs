b'2014-01-10T21:48:55 <Bosmon> Various pieces of bad news about the vbox file
2014-01-10T21:49:03 <Bosmon> Ranging from the mildly bad, to, I suspect, the more seriously bad : P
2014-01-10T21:49:31 <Bosmon> Firstly the zip file is itself corrupt because it seems there are some of the wierd Mac metadata files in there that presumably changed during the zip process
2014-01-10T21:49:35 <Bosmon> So it reports a CRC error on unpacking
2014-01-10T21:50:09 <Bosmon> But the error doesn\'t affect the serious files
2014-01-10T21:50:38 <Bosmon> Secondly, I get an error on startup about a missing ISO file with the VBoxGuestAdditions
2014-01-10T21:50:44 <Bosmon> Which also seems irrelevantish
2014-01-10T21:50:54 <Bosmon> But the serious problem is that when starting the VM I get a console error from within it:
2014-01-10T21:51:09 <Bosmon> error: file /grub2/i386-pc/normal.mod not found
2014-01-10T21:51:13 <Bosmon> Entering rescue mode...
2014-01-10T21:51:16 <Bosmon> grub rescue> _
2014-01-10T21:51:20 <Bosmon> Any ideas?
2014-01-10T21:52:30 <colinclark> crumbs!
2014-01-10T21:52:40 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure if this means it is genuinely corrupt, or else just missing some vital file which is not needed when running under MacOs that is essential when hosted by Windows
2014-01-10T21:52:56 <colinclark> It seems unlikely, but I don\'t konw
2014-01-10T21:52:59 <Bosmon> All the same, you\'d think that VirtualBox was better than this
2014-01-10T21:53:01 <colinclark> grub is the boot loader
2014-01-10T21:53:05 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-01-10T21:53:13 <Bosmon> I have no idea what to type to it : P
2014-01-10T21:53:19 <colinclark> So, I think the easiest thing to do, Bosmon, is to make yourself a new image
2014-01-10T21:53:22 <colinclark> It\'s actually quite easy
2014-01-10T21:53:26 <colinclark> and I can point you to what you need
2014-01-10T21:53:30 <colinclark> I\'m so sorry :(
2014-01-10T21:53:39 <colinclark> I thought it would be sufficient to just zip up the directory
2014-01-10T21:54:23 <Bosmon> Well sure
2014-01-10T21:54:27 <colinclark> I am not winning this week :P
2014-01-10T21:54:41 <Bosmon> But this sadly seriously reduces the chance I can reproduce your issue :(
2014-01-10T21:55:59 <Bosmon> Somehow grub claims that hd0 has an "unknown filesystem"
2014-01-10T21:56:08 <Bosmon> So this raises the chance that the image is just corrupt
2014-01-10T21:56:21 <Bosmon> You didn\'t have the VM open at the time you made the zip by any chance?
2014-01-10T21:56:57 <Bosmon> aha
2014-01-10T21:57:01 <colinclark> No, I had quit it I believe
2014-01-10T21:57:02 <Bosmon> there is one readable partition
2014-01-10T21:57:05 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-01-10T21:57:08 <Bosmon> Which it calls (hd0,msdos1)
2014-01-10T21:57:13 <colinclark> http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Live/x86_64/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso
2014-01-10T21:57:21 <colinclark> That\'s the Fedora 20 live ISO
2014-01-10T21:57:27 <Bosmon> sgithens
2014-01-10T21:57:29 <Bosmon> Can you wake?
2014-01-10T21:57:34 <Bosmon> I have a CRITICKAL PRODUCTION ISSUE
2014-01-10T21:57:36 <colinclark> you can download that, pop it into a fresh VMWare VM, and it\'s really easy to follow the instructions
2014-01-10T21:57:50 <Bosmon> Colin has sent me a VirtualBox VM with Fedora 20 in it which seems a bit corrupt
2014-01-10T21:57:59 <Bosmon> And I am stuck at the grub bootloader rescue screen
2014-01-10T21:58:52 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i filed a jira and sent a pull request http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5250
2014-01-10T21:58:55 * the-t-in-rtf1 has quit
2014-01-10T21:59:02 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-01-10T21:59:15 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: hopefully it\'s a valid test, i also put another example in the jira, but as i mentioned there i\'ve had a few different results so some of those forms may be incorrect.
2014-01-10T22:00:40 <Bosmon> Thanks Justin_o_
2014-01-10T22:00:44 <Bosmon> Ok colinclark, I will do it

2014-01-10T23:50:46 <colinclark> hi michelled
2014-01-10T23:51:01 <michelled> hi colinclark - I\'m trying to test GPII-115
2014-01-10T23:51:07 <colinclark> yup
2014-01-10T23:51:26 <colinclark> So the Device Reporter is deployed as a static file currently
2014-01-10T23:51:30 <michelled> I\'m finding that RWG isn\'t launching, but I\'m not sure if it\'s an issue with the code or perhaps my system setup
2014-01-10T23:51:45 <colinclark> I think it\'s actually the win32.json file
2014-01-10T23:51:59 <colinclark> So the default device reporter file doesn\'t include Read Write Gold: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json
2014-01-10T23:52:18 <colinclark> Can you send me a link to the pull request you\'re looking at?
2014-01-10T23:52:22 <colinclark> And we\'ll see if it changes that?
2014-01-10T23:52:33 <michelled> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/121/commits
2014-01-10T23:52:41 <michelled> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/42
2014-01-10T23:52:47 <colinclark> Sorry, that file I sent you was the Solutions Registry file
2014-01-10T23:52:51 <colinclark> this is the device reporter stub: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/deviceReporter/installedSolutions.json
2014-01-10T23:52:55 <colinclark> which also doesn\'t contain RWG
2014-01-10T23:52:58 <colinclark> so let\'s see about this one
2014-01-10T23:53:32 <colinclark> it looks like it does indeed change these files
2014-01-10T23:53:46 <colinclark> so you\'ve merged those two pull requests, but still don\'t see RWG launching?
2014-01-10T23:54:01 <michelled> yeah
2014-01-10T23:54:32 <colinclark> ok, that\'s pretty odd
2014-01-10T23:54:38 <colinclark> Do you see anything in the log at all?
2014-01-10T23:55:08 * avtar has quit
2014-01-10T23:57:02 <michelled> nothing obvious
2014-01-10T23:57:29 <michelled> but it does scroll off pretty quick
2014-01-10T23:57:41 <michelled> do you know how to set my terminal to show me more?
2014-01-10T23:57:53 <colinclark> Sadly I don\'t
2014-01-10T23:58:02 <colinclark> Kasper does or Bosmon / Bosmon7 does
2014-01-10T23:58:21 <colinclark> but you might be able to see a settings window somewhere in that little icon I showed you in the top left of the window
2014-01-10T23:58:36 <colinclark> alternatively you might be able to use the cygwin terminal to greater effect

b'2014-01-10T18:13:03 <Justin_o_> :)
2014-01-10T18:13:04 <Bosmon> I should get to my shower, colinclark to his coffee, and you to your review : P
2014-01-10T18:13:17 <colinclark> squirrels and cats and labrador retrievers in this test case
2014-01-10T18:13:19 <colinclark> very good
2014-01-10T18:13:22 <Justin_o_> Bosmon, colinclark: both of yours sound more relaxing.
2014-01-10T18:13:42 <colinclark> From the code perspective, Justin_o_, I\'m happy with what I see here
2014-01-10T18:13:54 <Bosmon> Actually this old portion of the "escapedGetConfig" etc. was quite a mess in the old codebase
2014-01-10T18:13:57 <Justin_o_> colinclark: thanks..
2014-01-10T18:13:59 <Bosmon> And what was there didn\'t really work
2014-01-10T18:13:59 <colinclark> But have a look yourself
2014-01-10T18:14:01 <Justin_o_> i\'ll get to merging that then
2014-01-10T18:14:12 <colinclark> don\'t take my word for it :)
2014-01-10T18:14:19 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i\'ve read it over a couple times now, and it looks okay
2014-01-10T18:14:20 <Bosmon> TAKEN OBODY SWORD FORIT!
2014-01-10T18:14:44 <colinclark> Justin_o_: ok great
2014-01-10T18:14:44 <colinclark> then go for it
2014-01-10T18:14:45 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-10T18:15:24 <colinclark> and thanks a lot, Bosmon for merging this in with the larger FLUID-3674 pull request
2014-01-10T18:15:56 <Bosmon> np colinclark!
2014-01-10T18:16:21 <colinclark> michelled: When Bosmon gets back, can you lay a list of pull requests on him if there\'s anything that needs review? Otherwise, I think he\'s going to take a look at the stalling acceptance tests on Linux when this VM is uploaded.
2014-01-10T18:16:42 <colinclark> And I\'ll look at whatever you need, or move on to the demo preparation
2014-01-10T18:17:01 <michelled> sure colinclark
2014-01-10T18:17:06 <colinclark> will kasparnet be back at all?
2014-01-10T18:17:21 <michelled> no - we\'ll pick up the end to end testing tomorrow morning
2014-01-10T18:17:28 <colinclark> woah
2014-01-10T18:17:29 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T18:17:39 <michelled> I\'ll get the branch in as good shape as I can today
2014-01-10T18:17:57 <colinclark> that\'s wonderful
2014-01-10T18:18:00 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: was this pull also supposed to solve FLUID-5248, i wasn\'t quite sure
2014-01-10T18:19:00 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: by the way, I\'w merge your pull in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/451
2014-01-10T18:19:11 <Justin_o_> and closed FLUID-5247
2014-01-10T18:28:18 * colinclark has quit
2014-01-10T18:35:49 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-01-10T18:40:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - please see the description on the FLUID-5248 JIRA
2014-01-10T18:40:35 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o_
2014-01-10T18:41:36 <Justin_o_> Bosmon:  thanks.. i see the jira should remain open
2014-01-10T18:49:58 <colinclark> Bosmon: That VM is up now
2014-01-10T18:50:51 <colinclark> If anyone needs a Fedora VM for testing the GPII, it is here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fol9zdgkj9qd808/fh9F5l3o7A
2014-01-10T18:51:04 <colinclark> I will provision a bring-your-own-key Windows instance when I get a chance, too.
2014-01-10T18:51:16 <colinclark> It\'s a VirtualBox VM
2014-01-10T18:51:38 <Bosmon> Great!
2014-01-10T18:51:40 <Bosmon> Thanks, colinclark
2014-01-10T18:52:32 <Bosmon> Downloading now!
2014-01-10T18:52:34 <Bosmon> 15 mins to go ....
2014-01-10T18:53:02 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i should have asked you for that this morning :(
2014-01-10T18:53:34 <colinclark> oh, I\'m sorry Justin_o_
2014-01-10T18:53:49 <Justin_o_> no worries.. i had the fun of setting one up for myself..
2014-01-10T18:53:49 <colinclark> My network connection is so bad that it took 12 hours to upload this 2 GB file
2014-01-10T18:53:51 <colinclark> so it just finished now
2014-01-10T18:53:58 <colinclark> Fedora is pretty painless to set up
2014-01-10T18:54:12 <colinclark> except for their insane decision to put the "Done" button on each panel in the top left corner of the window
2014-01-10T18:54:17 <colinclark> instead of the bottom right
2014-01-10T18:54:19 <Justin_o_> we get spoiled in the office here with the super fast connections.
2014-01-10T18:54:28 <colinclark> yes, I need to call teksavvy
2014-01-10T18:54:31 <colinclark> this one should be decent
2014-01-10T18:55:29 <Justin_o_> colinclark: that "done" button got me at first.. i had a problem installing node... i updated the instructions for that on the wiki though.. basically just deleted some things
2014-01-10T18:56:08 <colinclark> You must be using Fedora 19?
2014-01-10T18:56:40 <Justin_o_> yep
2014-01-10T18:56:45 <colinclark> sorry about that
2014-01-10T18:56:52 <colinclark> and thanks for updating it
2014-01-10T18:57:01 <Justin_o_> no problem.. it\'s working now
2014-01-10T18:57:10 <colinclark> Did you update the MinGW section for Windows? I remember I had said I\'d do it and completely forgot :(
2014-01-10T19:11:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - "it\'s working"?
2014-01-10T19:21:25 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i updated that yesterday
2014-01-10T19:21:43 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i mean Fedora is working, PMT is partially working
2014-01-10T19:46:29 <colinclark> So should we check in at all about next steps for the review, Bosmon and michelled?
2014-01-10T19:46:45 <colinclark> or is everyone churning?
2014-01-10T19:47:16 <Bosmon> yes lets
2014-01-10T19:47:43 <Bosmon> I have a CATT on my arm so no apostrophes
2014-01-10T19:50:23 <michelled> let\'s check in
2014-01-10T19:50:35 <michelled> I was hoping to actually get into work, but that will have to wait :)
2014-01-10T19:50:39 <michelled> more important to check in now
2014-01-10T19:52:24 <Bosmon> Are we Skyping?
2014-01-10T19:54:06 <colinclark> it\'s up to you, michelled
2014-01-10T19:54:11 <colinclark> if you\'d rather go to work, that\'s cool
2014-01-10T19:54:17 <colinclark> I guess sky ping might make sense
2014-01-10T20:01:56 <colinclark> yzen: Just to triple check, this is now ready for Bosmon to review, right? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/171
2014-01-10T20:10:27 <yzen> colinclark: yes
2014-01-10T20:10:31 <colinclark> awesome
2014-01-10T20:10:35 <colinclark> can you join a Skype call with us?
2014-01-10T20:10:44 <colinclark> to do some super-quick sprint coordination?
2014-01-10T20:11:13 <yzen> i m was about to bike home, can i dial you once i relocate ?
2014-01-10T20:11:42 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-10T20:11:46 <colinclark> ride safely

2014-01-10T20:23:14 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: are you still there.. i have a question about conditional transforms
2014-01-10T20:23:31 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o_
2014-01-10T20:24:24 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: hello.. any idea why i can\'t ever get the false condition from this http://pastie.org/8621628
2014-01-10T20:24:43 <Justin_o_> in fact the conditionalPath could be removed and I\'d get the same result..
2014-01-10T20:27:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - I can\'t see an obvious fault, no
2014-01-10T20:27:21 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: it\'s so strange :(
2014-01-10T20:27:31 <Bosmon> Would you like to progressively simplify it until it agrees with one of the cases in the test cases and see at what point it starts working?
2014-01-10T20:27:49 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i modified a test case and it was passing :(
2014-01-10T20:28:08 <Justin_o_> but i can try to modify the test case till i get back to this and see if i can get a failure
2014-01-10T20:28:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ would you like to join our call
2014-01-10T20:31:33 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: sure
2014-01-10T20:39:07 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: is there a way to use a conditional transform and push the result to the root of the model
2014-01-10T20:39:43 <Justin_o_> basically i only want to include something if a certain value of another model property is true
2014-01-10T20:40:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - well, surely you can just change its outputPath
2014-01-10T20:40:32 <Bosmon> Could you give some more context on the problem you are solving?
2014-01-10T20:42:30 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes.. sure basically the issue is that if we have the preference for screen readers set to false, but provide values for say the speechRate then the screen reader is still turned on. I want to strip these extra values when saving in the case where the screen reader is not enabled
2014-01-10T20:42:47 <Justin_o_> but all the preferences lie at the top level of the model
2014-01-10T20:58:09 * yzen joined the channel
2014-01-10T21:00:46 <yzen> colinclark: are you guys still planning ?
2014-01-10T21:00:52 <colinclark> yup
2014-01-10T21:01:04 <colinclark> we\'re almost finish chatting with J&C about the PMT/PCP and then we\'ll chat
2014-01-10T21:02:35 <yzen> k
2014-01-10T21:05:31 <Bosmon> I could join for a bit if it\'s relevant since it looks like I\'m not going out for a bit
2014-01-10T21:06:55 <jhung> Justin_o_: when we closed FLOE-111 (Create a Metadata Demo), we left behind some related sub-tasks. Is it okay if I convert those to regular issues?
2014-01-10T21:07:53 <colinclark> yzen: are you ready?
2014-01-10T21:07:58 <yzen> ya
2014-01-10T21:10:28 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-01-10T21:11:42 <Bosmon> Hi colinclark - can\'t connect to the Skype call for some reason
2014-01-10T21:11:53 <Bosmon> Thanks
2014-01-10T21:11:56 <Justin_o_> jhung: yes you can convert those
2014-01-10T21:12:08 <jhung> thanks Justin_o_
2014-01-10T21:12:10 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: still have some questions about conditional transforms if you have time
2014-01-10T21:12:50 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o_ - what\'s your progress
2014-01-10T21:15:39 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: well it seems that if i have an object returned for the true/false paths that the issue arries
2014-01-10T21:15:52 <Justin_o_> i\'ll see if i can make a unit test to confirm this
2014-01-10T21:16:00 <Bosmon> Ok, that would be great, Justin_o_
2014-01-10T21:16:12 <Bosmon> I\'ll deal with it today, but the question is what the implication of this is for the review meeting
2014-01-10T21:16:23 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: also i wanted to use output path to push something to the root would i set it to ""
2014-01-10T21:16:43 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i guess that depends...
2014-01-10T21:16:58 <Justin_o_> it would be better if it worked of course but we might be able to get around it
2014-01-10T21:17:16 <Bosmon> Well, I can fix it within a couple of hours
2014-01-10T21:17:18 <Bosmon> But you will be gone
2014-01-10T21:27:28 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: yes.. sadly..
2014-01-10T21:27:42 <Bosmon> Well, please do make the test case in any case
2014-01-10T21:28:16 <Bosmon> Although I wonder whether this is really all just caused by the same issue that we met failing to resolve FLUID-5248
2014-01-10T21:28:25 <Justin_o_> Bosmon:  okay.. i\'m looking at it now, but the test is actually returning something different than i expected.. which an empty object.. i guess this is still useful but not sure the test is written properly
2014-01-10T21:28:36 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: could be
2014-01-10T21:29:49 <Bosmon> In which case we won\'t be able to resolve it without fundamentally rethinking the ModelTransformation architecture .....
2014-01-10T21:31:45 <colinclark> Worst case scenario, could Justin_o_ create a custom transformer that does what he needs in code?
2014-01-10T21:32:06 <Bosmon> colinclark - certainly
2014-01-10T21:32:17 <Bosmon> Very easily
2014-01-10T21:32:24 <Bosmon> fluid.transforms.nonBrokenCondition : P
2014-01-10T21:33:04 <colinclark> Justin_o_: Can you do me a huge favour?
2014-01-10T21:33:18 <colinclark> Can you, really quickly, paste me the list you\'ve got of what does and doesn\'t work in the PMT?
2014-01-10T21:36:27 <Justin_o_> colinclark: sure one second i\'ll write it up.
2014-01-10T21:36:33 <colinclark> thanks

b'2014-01-10T17:20:12 <michelled> wait, does that mean there should be another pull request for it?
2014-01-10T17:23:48 <yzen> no ill update 115
2014-01-10T17:23:56 * clown joined the channel
2014-01-10T17:25:13 <colinclark> michelled: Your notes regarding the registry resolver...
2014-01-10T17:25:17 <colinclark> which pull request is that one?
2014-01-10T17:27:42 <michelled> it\'s the kettle #8 pull request colinclark
2014-01-10T17:28:05 <colinclark> this one I\'m looking at :)
2014-01-10T17:28:10 <michelled> yes :)
2014-01-10T17:28:22 <colinclark> Somehow there\'s a gap in how we describe things
2014-01-10T17:28:24 <colinclark> not that it\'s bad
2014-01-10T17:28:32 <michelled> oh, I completely agree :)
2014-01-10T17:28:36 <colinclark> but I\'m just looking at a pull request that "fixes the issue" :)
2014-01-10T17:28:50 <colinclark> not knowing that it connects with the registry resolver
2014-01-10T17:28:51 <colinclark> but that\'s okay
2014-01-10T17:28:52 <colinclark> i get it now
2014-01-10T17:45:36 <colinclark> So yzen, the Kettle side of GPII-115 is in
2014-01-10T17:45:44 <colinclark> Do we also need a companion change to universal?
2014-01-10T17:45:55 <colinclark> to update its version of Kettle?
2014-01-10T17:46:50 <Bosmon> colinclark - I believe this one is http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-504 ?
2014-01-10T17:47:40 <Bosmon> I guess this exhibits our rather painful "step by step" process of dependency management, in that every project needs to be kept with a consistent infusion ref
2014-01-10T17:47:45 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-10T17:47:46 <colinclark> it\'s horrible
2014-01-10T17:47:58 <colinclark> and even more horrible now that it looks like newer version of npm don\'t even respect it
2014-01-10T17:48:03 <Bosmon> yes
2014-01-10T17:48:06 <colinclark> I should say "horrible"
2014-01-10T17:48:15 <colinclark> I mean, it works and is at least explicit about what we\'re doing
2014-01-10T17:48:21 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-01-10T17:48:28 <colinclark> horrible in the sense that it\'s a lot of very fine manual synchronization
2014-01-10T17:48:34 <Bosmon> I imagine it is substantially less horrible than OSGi for example : P
2014-01-10T17:48:47 <Bosmon> But nonetheless we need to think of an answer to it ....
2014-01-10T17:49:11 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-10T17:49:27 <colinclark> yzen: Is this pull request dead or superseded at this point? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/121
2014-01-10T17:49:35 <colinclark> Or is all this work ultimately being done to make it viable?
2014-01-10T17:49:59 <colinclark> And is there a pull request for GPII-504 that I should look at?
2014-01-10T17:50:37 <Bosmon> Looks like he just updated it seconds ago
2014-01-10T17:51:13 <yzen> Bosmon: like a boss
2014-01-10T17:51:32 <colinclark> :) :)
2014-01-10T17:51:42 <yzen> kasparnet: the RWG can now be tested with the updated 115 pull for universal
2014-01-10T17:52:41 <michelled> yzen: can anyone besides kasparnet test it? he isn\'t around right now
2014-01-10T17:52:55 <Justin_o_> yzen: is there a user profile that uses the screen reader?
2014-01-10T17:53:07 <yzen> michelled: well anyone who actually has RWG installed on their windows
2014-01-10T17:53:11 <yzen> colinclark: ? :) ^
2014-01-10T17:53:20 * jhung joined the channel
2014-01-10T17:53:55 <colinclark> The MoonBook Pro has it
2014-01-10T17:54:01 <colinclark> and there\'s a copy in Dropbox
2014-01-10T17:54:06 <yzen> michelled: GPII-457 is updated
2014-01-10T17:54:11 <michelled> thx yzen
2014-01-10T17:54:16 <colinclark> which I can send a link to anyone who needs it, but would rather do off-channel for obvious reasons
2014-01-10T17:54:31 <colinclark> we were given it by the TextHelp CEO specifically for GPII testing
2014-01-10T17:54:33 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe I should finish up my coffee and go to where the MoonBook Pro is
2014-01-10T17:54:44 <colinclark> are you not in the office either, michelled?
2014-01-10T17:54:45 <sgithens> MoonBook Pro?
2014-01-10T17:54:46 <Justin_o_> colinclark: i have a fedora vm running now. am trying out chris\' code.. would you be interstedin screen sharing with me to see it.. seems like only the increase size panel works at this point.
2014-01-10T17:55:06 <colinclark> I would love to, Justin_o_
2014-01-10T17:55:08 <michelled> nope - I wanted to maximize time with kasparnet so I\'ve been working at home
2014-01-10T17:55:19 <Justin_o_> colinclark: let me know when you are free
2014-01-10T17:55:20 <colinclark> unfortunately most of my bandwidth is eaten up by this VM I am uploading
2014-01-10T17:55:30 <colinclark> According to this, 42 minutes
2014-01-10T17:55:36 <colinclark> :(
2014-01-10T17:55:42 * kasparnet has quit
2014-01-10T17:55:44 <Justin_o_> colinclark: okay.. please ping me when you are ready..
2014-01-10T17:55:52 <yzen> Justin_o_: there\'s gotta be , doesn\'t carla use one ?
2014-01-10T17:55:56 <cindyli> yzen: is there a special protocol used for the gpii websocket? do i need to specify a protocol at creating the websocket instance?
2014-01-10T17:55:57 <yzen> oh screen reader
2014-01-10T17:55:58 <colinclark> Andre
2014-01-10T17:55:58 <yzen> not sure
2014-01-10T17:56:01 <colinclark> Andrei
2014-01-10T17:56:05 <yzen> thanks colinclark
2014-01-10T17:56:23 <Justin_o_> yzen, colinclark: thanks i\'ll try that one
2014-01-10T17:56:38 <colinclark> sgithens: MoonBook Pro
2014-01-10T17:56:44 <colinclark> the T520s we bought at work...
2014-01-10T17:56:47 <colinclark> are really heavy beasts
2014-01-10T17:56:55 <colinclark> and they have little LED moons on them
2014-01-10T17:56:58 <colinclark> which are kind of cute
2014-01-10T17:57:01 <Bosmon> hahaha
2014-01-10T17:57:02 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-01-10T17:57:04 <Bosmon> I love the little moons
2014-01-10T17:57:11 <Bosmon> They are ancestral
2014-01-10T17:57:32 <colinclark> James Yoon was making fun of me for liking the ThinkPad so much
2014-01-10T17:57:33 <Bosmon> I can\'t actually remember a Thinkpad without them
2014-01-10T17:57:39 <colinclark> so I dubbed it the MoonBook Pro
2014-01-10T17:57:53 <Bosmon> Although with every following release they erode some other core feature
2014-01-10T17:58:08 <colinclark> If only it didn\'t weight 400 lbs and have a dismally low screen resolution, it might be a fine laptop
2014-01-10T17:58:10 <Bosmon> The decent keyboards are gone in every machine produced since 2012
2014-01-10T17:58:15 <colinclark> Do the Yogis still have moons, Bosmon?
2014-01-10T17:58:27 <Justin_o_> colinclark, yzen: okay andrei worked for turning on orca so must be something wrong with the preferences saved by pmt
2014-01-10T17:58:29 <Bosmon> yogis not only have no moons, they have no ***TRACKPOINT POINTING DEVICE***
2014-01-10T17:58:42 <colinclark> FEATURE
2014-01-10T17:58:48 <Bosmon> colinclark - the new T540s have the astonishing resolution screen
2014-01-10T17:58:51 <Bosmon> 2880x1400 or so
2014-01-10T17:58:59 <Bosmon> But they are also as heavy as ****
2014-01-10T17:59:01 <colinclark> Do they have a trackpad larger than a postage stamp?
2014-01-10T17:59:09 <Bosmon> Same trackpad
2014-01-10T17:59:20 <colinclark> yeah, laptop weight for us old people is increasingly a factor
2014-01-10T17:59:28 <colinclark> My ChromeBook will be so light, when I get it :P
2014-01-10T17:59:42 <colinclark> So light, it will lack APPLICATIONS
2014-01-10T17:59:55 <colinclark> those native apps sure do weigh a lot
2014-01-10T18:00:15 <Bosmon> hahaha
2014-01-10T18:01:34 <Bosmon> colinclark - as BCS tells us... "Electrons are stories too" : P
2014-01-10T18:01:39 <colinclark> :) :)
2014-01-10T18:01:42 <colinclark> so poetic
2014-01-10T18:02:16 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: has anyone reviewed your FLUID-5247 pull?
2014-01-10T18:02:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - noone - would you like to?
2014-01-10T18:02:35 <Bosmon> I think colinclark will be getting a coffee for a bit
2014-01-10T18:02:51 <colinclark> i\'m sorry :(
2014-01-10T18:03:18 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: i was looking over it earlier this morning.. seemed okay other than those sporadic unit test failures.. although they pass when they were run on their own.. so could have been something with the all tests
2014-01-10T18:03:44 <colinclark> I\'ll have a quick look at the code now, Justin_o_
2014-01-10T18:03:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - I rambled a bit about that issue earlier
2014-01-10T18:03:49 <colinclark> and then you can push it
2014-01-10T18:03:51 <Justin_o_> in terms of the code changes it looks like mostly you just added some new public functions on the fluid.pathUtil namespace.. is that correct
2014-01-10T18:04:02 <Bosmon> About our sporadic all-tests failures - I don\'t think we can do much about them for a while
2014-01-10T18:04:09 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: okay
2014-01-10T18:04:20 <Bosmon> Especially since they are very infrequent and seem to occur only on slower or heavily loaded machines
2014-01-10T18:04:37 <Bosmon> And my suspicion is that they will require a QUnit patch in order to fix
2014-01-10T18:04:53 <Justin_o_> eek
2014-01-10T18:04:54 <Justin_o_> okay
2014-01-10T18:05:55 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: was this function only used for guards fluid.pathUtil.getExcessPath
2014-01-10T18:06:16 <sgithens> oh yeah, mine has a moon too
2014-01-10T18:06:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - what do you mean "was"?
2014-01-10T18:06:53 <Bosmon> It may have moved, but all the old functions should still be there
2014-01-10T18:06:56 <Justin_o_> how about "is" :)
2014-01-10T18:07:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - yes, all of those utilities will be blasted in the new ChangeApplier
2014-01-10T18:07:37 <Bosmon> That section of the file now agrees with the layout in the FLUID-3674 branch
2014-01-10T18:07:43 <Justin_o_> yes.. saw the others were moved..
2014-01-10T18:07:45 <Bosmon> With all the "obsoleting ones" placed lower down
2014-01-10T18:08:27 <Bosmon> colinclark and I were talking yesterday at my "slow revelation" that noone in fact should ever be doing processing based on the string forms of EL paths
2014-01-10T18:08:44 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: what do you mean?
2014-01-10T18:08:48 <Bosmon> But these utilities and the corresponding part of ModelTransformations.js which had the FLUID-5247 bug were based on the "old way of thinking"
2014-01-10T18:09:14 <Bosmon> colinclark became surprised to find the "path" element of a ChangeEvent he received had the form of an array of string path segments, rather than a full EL string
2014-01-10T18:09:23 <colinclark> yes
2014-01-10T18:09:25 <Bosmon> But I explained that I had realised that this is actually what people "really want"
2014-01-10T18:10:00 <Bosmon> In the new ChangeApplier this revolution is mostly complete, but the old ChangeApplier and also MT still try to perform operations based on "raw paths"
2014-01-10T18:10:06 <Bosmon> Which, ironically, was responsible for the bug you saw
2014-01-10T18:10:38 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: okay.. so now we operate on arrays of path segments
2014-01-10T18:10:57 <colinclark> yep
2014-01-10T18:10:59 <Bosmon> The FLUID-4258 system that we have already is sort of "intermediate"
2014-01-10T18:11:01 <Justin_o_> and there parser is what is used to create that, i presume
2014-01-10T18:11:10 <Bosmon> That is, what you get when you register declarative change listeners
2014-01-10T18:11:26 <Bosmon> It is based on the old implementation, but it patches the signature to conform to the new API
2014-01-10T18:11:33 <colinclark> I saw things like ["pots", "0"] instead of "pots.0" in my change listeners, Justin_o_
2014-01-10T18:11:43 <colinclark> which, if you want to DO something with a path, is probably much more efficient
2014-01-10T18:11:44 <Bosmon> That is, declarative changeListeners correspond to the same API both in the old and the new ChangeApplier
2014-01-10T18:12:12 <Justin_o_> colinclark: yep makes sense.. and i guess is why you can pass in an array of paths to get and set too now
2014-01-10T18:12:16 <Bosmon> So in theory compatibility for clients who use the declarative system is easier
2014-01-10T18:12:20 <Bosmon> But unfortunately that isn\'t 100% of the story
2014-01-10T18:12:32 <Bosmon> Although the API appears conformant, the semantic is quite different
2014-01-10T18:12:40 <Bosmon> So in practice every component will require vetting by hand
2014-01-10T18:12:48 <Justin_o_> hmm.. i see
2014-01-10T18:12:53 <Bosmon> Anyway, this isn\'t a timely discussion :)
2014-01-10T18:12:56 <Justin_o_> to make sure they aren\'t trying to use things as strings

b'2014-01-10T16:01:10 <colinclark> is there a JIRA for the dumb file move, kasparnet, or should I file one
2014-01-10T16:01:11 <colinclark> ?
2014-01-10T16:01:23 <colinclark> GPII-600: Colin sucks at typing basic unix commands
2014-01-10T16:01:30 <kasparnet> colinclark: no jira - just a note in our pirate pad
2014-01-10T16:01:37 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T16:01:40 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2014-01-10T16:03:36 <yzen> colinclark: i think kasparnet means this one https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/8
2014-01-10T16:04:02 <colinclark> you need me to review that one, yzen?
2014-01-10T16:04:40 <yzen> colinclark: just a revision change in package.json there it would be super helpful as it will unblock 2 pulls for universal and windows
2014-01-10T16:06:44 <colinclark> ok, sure
2014-01-10T16:06:49 <yzen> colinclark: thanks!
2014-01-10T16:06:54 <colinclark> give me a few minutes, I\'m still pre-coffee
2014-01-10T16:06:56 <colinclark> which is dangerous :)
2014-01-10T16:07:01 <yzen> colinclark: haha sure :)
2014-01-10T16:09:01 <colinclark> kasparnet: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/189
2014-01-10T16:09:30 <yzen> colinclark: kasparnet i can merge it if you\'d like
2014-01-10T16:09:46 <colinclark> tough code review
2014-01-10T16:09:49 <colinclark> sure you\'re up for it, yzen?
2014-01-10T16:09:55 <yzen> ok
2014-01-10T16:09:57 <yzen> ill do it
2014-01-10T16:13:48 <colinclark> looks like kasparnet beat you to it, yzen
2014-01-10T16:13:55 <yzen> colinclark: that was me :)
2014-01-10T16:14:02 <colinclark> oh yes
2014-01-10T16:14:03 <colinclark> it was
2014-01-10T16:14:10 <colinclark> I have to get that coffee :(

2014-01-10T16:26:14 <michelled> also, what\'s it\'s status?
2014-01-10T16:26:23 <yzen> michelled: yes, i need to take a look at it still
2014-01-10T16:29:47 <colinclark> kasparnet: I just want to get a sense of what I should expect when I run the acceptance tests on Linux...
2014-01-10T16:30:01 <colinclark> Should the process end when it\'s all finished and give me a summary of passes/failures?
2014-01-10T16:30:21 <colinclark> As it stands now, I see a lot happening, and lots of successful tests in the log, mixed in with the usual sorts of logging
2014-01-10T16:30:51 <colinclark> and then it seems to just sort of hang, with Kettle sitting there listening, I think
2014-01-10T16:31:11 <kasparnet> hmm.. that didn\'t happen to me colinclark
2014-01-10T16:31:16 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T16:31:23 <kasparnet> it just gave me a nice green summary of all the tests having passed
2014-01-10T16:31:23 <colinclark> I\'ll get a fresh checkout and see if that\'s the issue
2014-01-10T16:31:33 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s what I was expecting too
2014-01-10T16:35:47 * the-t-in-rtf1 joined the channel
2014-01-10T16:37:46 <michelled> Justin_o_: do you know the status of this pull request?
2014-01-10T16:37:48 <michelled> https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/13
2014-01-10T16:38:13 * the-t-in-rtf has quit

2014-01-10T16:38:19 <kasparnet> colinclark ^ this is what you should see in the end
2014-01-10T16:40:00 <colinclark> Ok, on a fresh checkout it just hangs for me still
2014-01-10T16:40:22 <colinclark> the last tests I see passing are os_win7 using flat matchmaker
2014-01-10T16:42:00 <colinclark> michelled: Do you still have your Fedora 20 VM working?
2014-01-10T16:42:11 <colinclark> Any chance you could try it on your system?
2014-01-10T16:42:35 <michelled> I\'ve got Fedora 19
2014-01-10T16:42:48 <michelled> I\'ll check it here
2014-01-10T16:45:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o_, kasparnet - your model transformations fix is ready btw
2014-01-10T16:45:53 <Bosmon> In the end Justin_o_ wins the prize since his test case was actually valid, even if his JIRA failed to describe it :)
2014-01-10T16:46:33 <colinclark> lol
2014-01-10T16:47:03 <colinclark> Who needs to review it, Bosmon?
2014-01-10T16:47:11 <Bosmon> Anyone can review it
2014-01-10T16:47:24 <Bosmon> Who has i) time, and ii) Infusion commit
2014-01-10T16:47:28 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T16:47:40 <colinclark> Justin_o_: Do you have time to have a look?
2014-01-10T16:47:54 <Bosmon> It might be good for you to look at it since it is a little crosslinked with the FLUID-3674 work you had started to review
2014-01-10T16:48:03 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T16:48:05 <Bosmon> I decided to resolve it by a bit of "forward-looking cut n paste"
2014-01-10T16:48:14 <colinclark> ugh, i\'m sorry
2014-01-10T16:48:25 <Bosmon> That\'s fine, it was reasonably neat in the end
2014-01-10T16:48:41 <Bosmon> But about 150 lines of material got pasted in from FLUID-3674\'s DataBinding.js
2014-01-10T16:49:00 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T16:49:15 <Bosmon> And I\'ve updated your FLUID-3674 accordingly, to account for the 2 new tests
2014-01-10T16:49:23 <colinclark> thank you
2014-01-10T16:49:29 <colinclark> After that, I need to start on this "slow demo"
2014-01-10T16:49:33 <Bosmon> ok
2014-01-10T16:49:38 <Bosmon> What should I be looking at today?
2014-01-10T16:49:43 <colinclark> kasparnet: Will you be available to talk over Skype this weekend about that?
2014-01-10T16:49:56 <colinclark> Anything that we can salvage from falling into the hack branch
2014-01-10T16:50:05 <colinclark> and instead properly review and get into master if appropriate
2014-01-10T16:50:07 <Bosmon> I\'ll be happy to help with that too
2014-01-10T16:50:13 <Bosmon> I expect to be mostly available over the weekend
2014-01-10T16:50:20 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2014-01-10T16:50:23 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah - I\'ll be avialable over the weekend
2014-01-10T16:51:10 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2014-01-10T16:51:26 <colinclark> As I see it, there are probably three lines of coordination that need to be done today
2014-01-10T16:51:45 <colinclark> 1. Arranging for the full-system testing, which kasparnet and michelled have been doing--hence the hack branch, "review2"
2014-01-10T16:52:17 <colinclark> 2. Working with Avtar to get deployed versions of all the necessary services--including the RB and ST MMs--up and tested
2014-01-10T16:52:47 <colinclark> 3. Ongoing code review and testing based on a) salvaging pull requests from death in the hack branch and b) any new issues that come up during #1
2014-01-10T16:52:54 <colinclark> Does that seem right?
2014-01-10T16:53:30 * jhung has quit
2014-01-10T16:54:09 <michelled> colinclark: there is a fourth stream and that is figuring out what is to be done with PCP/PMT
2014-01-10T16:54:20 <colinclark> oh yes!
2014-01-10T16:54:22 <michelled> Justin_o_ and cindyli are busy with that
2014-01-10T16:54:34 <colinclark> I was just thinking how scary that is
2014-01-10T16:54:39 <michelled> but I think we probably need a check in again to see what can be done given the new information from Boyan
2014-01-10T16:54:45 <Bosmon> Ok - sounds like I could mostly help with 3. and 4.
2014-01-10T16:54:49 <colinclark> for reasons I probably shouldn\'t convey in a logged channel ;)
2014-01-10T16:55:04 <Bosmon> Anyone do ping me if they think I could lend a hand with what they are doing
2014-01-10T16:55:17 <colinclark> My impression is that, when it comes to PCP/PMT, it\'s "all on us" now
2014-01-10T16:55:34 <colinclark> yzen: Do you need any reviews from Bosmon?
2014-01-10T16:55:53 <michelled> colinclark: you are dealing with the pull for yzen, right? the update to kettle?
2014-01-10T16:56:05 <colinclark> trying to
2014-01-10T16:56:07 <yzen> colinclark: not atm, 457 is something he might be interested in
2014-01-10T16:56:14 <colinclark> I needed someone to sanity check the acceptance tests, though
2014-01-10T16:56:14 <michelled> it\'s my understanding that this also needs to be done: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-504
2014-01-10T16:56:16 <colinclark> did you get a chance?
2014-01-10T16:57:28 <Justin_o_> Bosmon: thanks for fixing my issue.. maybe you can fix the jira too ;) anyways.. i tried running the tests this morning.. and the model transformations one is now passing, but when i ran the all tests i was getting some failures in uploader and reordered on alternate runs.. not sure if it was related to your changes though
2014-01-10T16:58:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o_ - these things tend to happen sometimes - and it may not be easy at all to track down
2014-01-10T16:58:30 <Bosmon> The causes are i) race conditions in the browser in implementing focus changes and asynchronous events, ii) race conditions within the IoC testing framework
2014-01-10T16:58:53 <Bosmon> In general if you run any tests which fail again individually and they pass, the functionality is ok
2014-01-10T16:59:30 <Bosmon> ii) we could probably track down eventually but unfortunately it will probably involve sending a patch back to QUnit or making a fork of it
2014-01-10T16:59:37 <Bosmon> Neither of which will be much fun : P
2014-01-10T17:01:51 <michelled> colinclark: I just checked - they are hanging for me as well
2014-01-10T17:01:55 <michelled> with a clean master :(
2014-01-10T17:01:56 <Bosmon> The effects will be more pronounced when running on a slow or busy machine (Infusion test issues)
2014-01-10T17:02:01 <colinclark> fuck
2014-01-10T17:02:20 <colinclark> i should stop swearing in a logged channel, too
2014-01-10T17:02:37 <colinclark> gosh darn it shucks
2014-01-10T17:02:44 <Bosmon> CRUMBS!
2014-01-10T17:02:50 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-10T17:03:08 <colinclark> Ok, I guess the hack branch must go on while we figure this out
2014-01-10T17:03:31 <colinclark> this is the worst :(
2014-01-10T17:08:36 <Bosmon> michelled - when was the last time you saw them working?
2014-01-10T17:09:56 <colinclark> I\'m just tracing back--looks like they were hanging prior to my MM Proxy merge
2014-01-10T17:10:09 <colinclark> though I didn\'t catch that last night
2014-01-10T17:10:17 <michelled> yesterday afternoon, Bosmon
2014-01-10T17:10:35 <colinclark> kasparnet: Is it correct that I just need to run "node tests/AcceptanceTests.js" in the linux folder?
2014-01-10T17:12:29 <colinclark> This is strange, michelled, since even if I go back to Wednesday, the tests still seem to hang for me
2014-01-10T17:12:48 <michelled> you\'ve gone back on the linux repo too?
2014-01-10T17:13:00 <colinclark> ah yes, I should be careful to do that
2014-01-10T17:13:03 <colinclark> thanks
2014-01-10T17:13:07 <michelled> they weren\'t running prior to GPII-75 going in yesterday
2014-01-10T17:13:14 <colinclark> aha
2014-01-10T17:13:18 <michelled> so I was manually applying that patch to get them to run
2014-01-10T17:13:22 <michelled> when I was testing other pulls
2014-01-10T17:13:43 <Bosmon> michelled - which patch makes them run?
2014-01-10T17:14:01 <michelled> https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/39
2014-01-10T17:15:20 <Bosmon> oh ok, GPII-75 itself
2014-01-10T17:16:09 <Bosmon> And did you see them woriking after that?
2014-01-10T17:17:33 <michelled> I did not run them after that, Bosmon. kasparnet did and says that they ran and passed
2014-01-10T17:18:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah, I tested it out and everything ran fine
2014-01-10T17:18:08 <colinclark> hey kasparnet
2014-01-10T17:18:10 <colinclark> just for sanity\'s sake
2014-01-10T17:18:20 <colinclark> can you grab a fresh checkout and run the tests and see how they work?
2014-01-10T17:18:26 <colinclark> I know you\'re probably doing a million other more important things
2014-01-10T17:18:28 <colinclark> so it\'s okay if not
2014-01-10T17:19:07 <michelled> yzen: is this the same as the pull request colinclark is reviewing for you? http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-504
2014-01-10T17:19:35 <yzen> michelled: yes
2014-01-10T17:19:39 <yzen> but we don\'t have it yet
2014-01-10T17:19:49 <michelled> ah, good - at least it\'s not another task ;)
2014-01-10T17:19:51 <yzen> there\'s only one for kettle for 1

2014-01-10T03:55:18 <Bosmon> colinclark - I have one in for model transforms at the moment
2014-01-10T03:55:25 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T03:55:29 <colinclark> Shall I start there?
2014-01-10T03:55:36 <Bosmon> And there are of course those ones with grade linkage for the windows registry resolver
2014-01-10T03:55:43 <Bosmon> But how is our status with MATCHYMATCHYMATCHMAKERS?
2014-01-10T03:57:13 <colinclark> I am several hours behind on the IRC channel and apparently 65 emails behind
2014-01-10T03:57:21 <colinclark> so I guess you might be able to tell me
2014-01-10T03:57:35 <colinclark> Were you able to look at the Matchamaker proxy pull request?
2014-01-10T03:58:09 <Bosmon> Well, maybe
2014-01-10T03:58:19 <Bosmon> I think that is the one I made the fuss about the apparently superfluous file in?
2014-01-10T03:58:27 <colinclark> Paste me a link?
2014-01-10T03:59:43 <Bosmon> Starting at 15:52 today EST ....
2014-01-10T03:59:50 <Bosmon> Still trying to find the parent link
2014-01-10T03:59:58 <colinclark> I think I have most of that in my buffer
2014-01-10T04:00:00 <colinclark> no worries
2014-01-10T04:00:04 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/174/files
2014-01-10T04:00:05 <Bosmon> This one
2014-01-10T04:00:36 <colinclark> yes, this naming issue is one that I had a long talk with Kasper
2014-01-10T04:00:43 <Bosmon> Today?
2014-01-10T04:00:50 <colinclark> no, at least a month ago
2014-01-10T04:00:54 <Bosmon> urgh
2014-01-10T04:00:55 <colinclark> and is, sadly, an example of a PiratePad that has vanished
2014-01-10T04:00:58 <Bosmon> One may as well write on the water : P
2014-01-10T04:01:07 <colinclark> I made detailed notes of our naming conventions
2014-01-10T04:01:11 <colinclark> we really do need that "publish to wiki" button :(
2014-01-10T04:01:25 <Bosmon> I tend to just keep mine open forever :)
2014-01-10T04:01:44 <colinclark> I lost some tabs with my recent kernel panics
2014-01-10T04:03:04 <Bosmon> So on the phone today you mentioned some complex workflow required for this pull
2014-01-10T04:03:08 <Bosmon> Which I failed to register completely
2014-01-10T04:03:15 <colinclark> I think the workflow, fortunately, isn\'t ours
2014-01-10T04:03:21 <colinclark> we just need to get it in
2014-01-10T04:03:37 <colinclark> from there, Nick and Andy can finish verifying that their Matchmaker servers work correctly with it
2014-01-10T04:03:44 <colinclark> and Avtar can deploy them
2014-01-10T04:05:37 <Bosmon> So, how can we verify this pull
2014-01-10T04:06:01 <Bosmon> Given that JURA\'s response when I asked him whether he could write an acceptance test for that stray file was, "I can\'t, because we don\'t have a rule-based matchmaker"
2014-01-10T04:10:36 <colinclark> But we do
2014-01-10T04:10:38 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T04:10:49 <colinclark> I think the answer is in an email from Nick
2014-01-10T04:11:06 <colinclark> and that I should be able to install the RBMM on a VM

2014-01-10T13:45:57 <jhung> Justin_o_ Are you and cindyli back on Metadata on Monday? I want to get a feel for how I should plan my day. :)
2014-01-10T13:46:41 <Justin_o_> jhung: i believe we are. It\'s my understanding that the gpii work needs to be done today
2014-01-10T13:49:48 <jhung> Justin_o_: okay. In that case I\'ll get cracking on the encoding of transcript and audio description metadata.
2014-01-10T13:52:40 <Justin_o_> jhung: thanks..
2014-01-10T13:53:05 <Justin_o_> jhung: cindyli and i still have to figure out our time estimates for all the tasks too.
2014-01-10T13:56:41 <jhung> Sure no problem Justin_o_. Mind if I join you two on that?

2014-01-10T14:42:40 <kasparnet> anyway, your pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/171 is giving us conflicts - and we\'re too scared to try and resolve them ourself
2014-01-10T14:46:37 <yzen> hehe
2014-01-10T14:46:47 <yzen> i am going to update it
2014-01-10T14:46:56 <yzen> but at this point it might not be necessary
2014-01-10T14:47:08 <yzen> it\'s more related to the online solutions registry than anything else
2014-01-10T14:47:40 <yzen> i am getting GPII-115 prepped, as soon as Michelle merges my pull for kettle
2014-01-10T15:02:22 <kasparnet> cool!! thanks yzen

2014-01-10T15:36:43 <cindyli> kasparnet and yzen, what\'s the common term for magnifier "show crosshairs" feature? don\'t find it in here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/ISO24751-2/flat.json
2014-01-10T15:42:50 <kasparnet> cindyli: hmm... there is none
2014-01-10T15:43:08 <kasparnet> cindyli: is it in the PMT?
2014-01-10T15:43:15 <cindyli> yes, kasparnet
2014-01-10T15:43:33 <kasparnet> ok, in that case call it: showCrosshairs
2014-01-10T15:43:53 <cindyli> ok, thanks, kasparnet

2014-01-10T15:53:13 <colinclark> hey michelled and kasparnet, I see evidence of a pretty amazing pull request blitz after I went to bed last night
2014-01-10T15:53:17 <colinclark> how\'s it going?
2014-01-10T15:53:25 <kasparnet> colinclark: good and bad
2014-01-10T15:53:30 <kasparnet> good in that things are moving forward
2014-01-10T15:53:38 <colinclark> cool
2014-01-10T15:53:41 <kasparnet> bad in that we\'ve now started with a special branch
2014-01-10T15:53:44 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-10T15:53:47 <colinclark> I figured that would happen
2014-01-10T15:53:52 <kasparnet> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-505?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel
2014-01-10T15:53:54 <michelled> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-505
2014-01-10T15:53:58 <michelled> ha :)
2014-01-10T15:54:23 <colinclark> Ok
2014-01-10T15:54:27 <michelled> colinclark: our TODO: http://piratepad.net/C8LL1msi1n
2014-01-10T15:54:37 <kasparnet> michelled: did you see yzen\'s ping earlier
2014-01-10T15:54:40 <colinclark> Is there anything else that can/should get reviewed and go into master, or are we pretty much done there?
2014-01-10T15:54:42 <kasparnet> about reviewing some pull reqeust
2014-01-10T15:55:30 <michelled> i saw it and am about to do it
2014-01-10T15:55:35 <kasparnet> colinclark: there is a small thing that would be nice to have fixed - GPII-270-rbmm-demo.json sneaked into the root of the universal folder
2014-01-10T15:55:49 <colinclark> oh fuck
2014-01-10T15:55:51 <colinclark> that was me
2014-01-10T15:55:57 <kasparnet> so we should put it into preferences dir
2014-01-10T15:55:58 <colinclark> I\'ll submit a pull request for it :P
2014-01-10T15:56:16 <colinclark> Stupid late night "git mv," I\'m so sorry
2014-01-10T15:56:19 <kasparnet> colinclark: hehe ok - cool! I mean, it\'s not at all vital and not really very important - just nice
2014-01-10T15:56:25 <kasparnet> no worries
2014-01-10T15:56:42 <michelled> colinclark: if things get into master at this point, it\'s still good
2014-01-10T15:57:10 <kasparnet> colinclark, michelled: yeah - I was just about to say - it\'s not too late to get stuff into master
2014-01-10T15:57:16 <michelled> it means that we\'ll have less clean up to do after the review and that the branch will be closer to master
2014-01-10T15:59:00 <colinclark> Ok, so we\'ll see if Bosmon can help with more reviews
2014-01-10T15:59:25 <colinclark> A lot of people are still doing their integration testing--like of the Matcha matchma matchmakers--against universal
2014-01-10T15:59:33 <colinclark> so it\'s worth trying to keep the reviews flowing
2014-01-10T15:59:54 <kasparnet> yup - agreed
2014-01-10T16:00:42 <michelled> colinclark: could you please review this for yzen?
2014-01-10T16:00:52 <colinclark> If anyone sees Bosmon emerge for the morning, can you relay a set of f pull requests that he can look at?
2014-01-10T16:00:54 <kasparnet> I\'m planning to get the last couple of SP3 apps reviewed over the weekend as well
