2014-12-30T12:18:13 <jhernandez> ANTVANIG!!
2014-12-30T12:19:28 <jhernandez> thanks for that initial review of https://github.com/GPII/android/pull/26
2014-12-30T12:20:30 <jhernandez> as I commented on the pull request, it\'s still a first implementation
2014-12-30T12:25:18 <jhernandez> so it\'s not ready to be merged yet, but we needed something for the review
2014-12-30T12:25:56 <Bosmon8> jhernandez - thanks for your work on it!
2014-12-30T12:26:01 <Bosmon8> VVANTTUNEZZZZ!
2014-12-30T12:28:18 <jhernandez> yeah, I had the luminosity thing working in Athens, but had a few problems with the noise one
2014-12-30T12:30:00 <jhernandez> that\'s the reason why I have some "unconnected" pieces of code
2014-12-30T12:30:51 <jhernandez> I\'ll keep working on it after the review
