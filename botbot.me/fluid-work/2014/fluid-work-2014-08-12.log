2014-08-12T13:32:01 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-08-12T13:36:32 <jhung> anastasiac: We didn't make a decision on that - we were waiting for you to be back.  I think it can be closed because it's independent of the mediawiki upgrade.
2014-08-12T13:36:43 <jhung> what do you think anastasiac?
2014-08-12T13:37:08 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I agree, let's close it. If we decide we want to do more work on the content, we can create another JIRA if necessary
2014-08-12T13:37:27 <jhung> Sounds good. I'll go and close that anastasiac.
2014-08-12T13:37:33 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2014-08-12T13:37:48 <jhung> Also we chatted a bit about the upgrade.
2014-08-12T13:38:51 <jhung> We decided that the best route forward for now is to disable new accounts and make it a manual process anastasiac.
2014-08-12T13:39:11 <jhung> This way the ILDH can be shown when the August tours come through.
2014-08-12T13:39:21 <anastasiac> yeah, that seems reasonable for now.
2014-08-12T13:39:35 <jhung> The static site conversion will be scheduled for another time. That will be up for discussion.
2014-08-12T13:39:57 <jhung> So when avtar is back, we'll talk to him about disabling new accounts.
2014-08-12T13:40:19 <jhung> We'll also need to create a new page or blurb to describe how someone would request an account.

2014-08-12T14:16:45 <simonjb> hi Bosmon
2014-08-12T14:16:46 <Bosmon> sgithens committed the fix for the Windows failures last night
2014-08-12T14:16:55 <Bosmon> So you should find it working now
2014-08-12T14:17:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: I saw that, I'm just testing the new code now
2014-08-12T14:17:23 <simonjb> thanks for fixing

2014-08-12T14:48:23 <simonjb> Bosmon: all looks good, I'm able to build and run the tests -- thanks

2014-08-12T15:08:41 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding handbook users requesting an account: The ConfirmAccount adds a sentence to the LogIn page with a link to its own account creation page. Perhaps we could mimic that, but have the link just be to an email address...
2014-08-12T15:09:51 <jhung> anastasiac: sounds reasonable.
2014-08-12T15:10:01 <anastasiac> I'll create a JIRA for that
2014-08-12T15:10:09 <jhung> great thanks anastasiac
2014-08-12T15:33:10 <jhung> vjoanna, simonjb - time for Connections meeting.
