2014-03-24T13:09:24 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2014-03-24T13:10:06 <Justin_o> it seems that everything worked with just the upgrade of infusion. Chris filed the pull request for the infusion update i did, so we just need a different set of eyes on the changes.
2014-03-24T13:10:08 <Justin_o> thanks

2014-03-24T13:32:33 <amilchev> Justin_o: quick one - what do you think is the best way to structure the HTML for these - http://issues.gpii.net/secure/attachment/10414/PCP%20save%26apply%20for%20pilots.pdf
2014-03-24T13:33:31 <amilchev> Justin_o: tried to apply background & color on "hover" on the div which contains them, but with no success
2014-03-24T13:37:15 <Justin_o> amilchev: i think you can do something like this  ".parent:hover .child: style"
2014-03-24T13:37:49 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m not sure if that will help with your situation.. let me know how it goes

2014-03-24T17:09:43 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - thanks for your new JIRA
2014-03-24T17:09:50 <Bosmon> Your writeup for it could be a little more complete : P
2014-03-24T17:10:04 <Bosmon> Do you think you could edit the text of it to include more of the material which was in the private mail you sent me?
2014-03-24T17:10:16 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2014-03-24T17:10:32 * danaayotte__ has left the channel
2014-03-24T17:10:42 <Bosmon> Soon we will have "commit hooks" for JIRA which prohibit filing issues with fewer than 3 sentences :)
2014-03-24T17:13:04 <Bosmon> Thanks for the universal pull, kasparnet - is there a matching one for Kettle?
2014-03-24T17:16:38 <cindyli> done. Bosmon. looking forward to having commit hooks\xe2\x80\xa6. :)
2014-03-24T17:19:24 <kasparnet> Bosmon: actually, I was pinging colinclark before you came on to ask whether that was still needed -- will create it straight away
2014-03-24T17:19:41 <kasparnet> I guess it\'ll stay needed until we fix all the stuff we talked about in SD
2014-03-24T17:22:35 <kasparnet> Bosmon: should I create a new JIRA for that pull request? or should I just refer to FLUID-5251 again (since that\'s the reason we\'re update the infusion ref)
2014-03-24T17:38:37 <Bosmon> kasparnet - it\'s ok to use the same JIRA
2014-03-24T17:55:58 <kasparnet> Bosmon:
2014-03-24T17:56:28 <kasparnet> Do you know if any recent update to infusion caused fluid.commonModelComponent to be assigned to any modelComponent?
2014-03-24T18:01:35 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, it did
2014-03-24T18:02:01 <kasparnet> ok - so it would be reasonable to expect (in the tests) any modelComponent to also have that grade
2014-03-24T18:02:18 <kasparnet> (currently two tests are failing due to that)
2014-03-24T18:02:30 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes - although I\'m wondering why modelComponent isn\'t good enough?
2014-03-24T18:02:37 <Bosmon> Do we have some components that have been upgraded already?
2014-03-24T18:03:35 <kasparnet> it\'s just a test that checks that the gradenames of some components are as expected
2014-03-24T18:04:07 <Bosmon> Oh, I guess it checks the complete grade content rather than just for the presence of one grade?
2014-03-24T18:04:12 <kasparnet> and two tests fails because commonModelComponent is a grade, but wasn\'t expected to be so
2014-03-24T18:04:14 <Bosmon> Yes, it\'s ok to just update those tests "ad hoc"
2014-03-24T18:04:14 <kasparnet> yeah, exaclty
2014-03-24T18:04:20 <kasparnet> cool - thanks
2014-03-24T18:04:24 <kasparnet> pull request coming shortly

2014-03-24T18:11:47 <Bosmon> I\'ll get to it later today

2014-03-24T18:17:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - the problem in your case seems to be with the underlying transform rather than with the model relay system
2014-03-24T18:17:59 <Bosmon> Do you think you could rework your pull into a set of test cases against the underlying transformer (arrayToSetMembership)
2014-03-24T18:18:40 <Bosmon> The one responsible is one KASPARNETTT! : P
2014-03-24T18:18:50 <cindyli> i can try, Bosmon, but i was actually starting with the transforms first and it worked ok
2014-03-24T18:19:03 <Bosmon> I see
2014-03-24T18:19:44 <Bosmon> Oh, I am looking at the wrong end of the transform, let me check further
2014-03-24T18:19:54 <cindyli> will also re-draft transforms and let u know, Bosmon
2014-03-24T18:19:57 <kasparnet> Bosmon, cindyli: WHAT? Am i hearing indications that my model transformers arent perfect? That sounds highly unlikely
2014-03-24T18:20:06 <kasparnet> :)
2014-03-24T18:20:27 <cindyli> finger crossing \xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2014-03-24T18:22:49 <cindyli> Bosmon: this is the transform i played with firebug - http://pastie.org/8965035
2014-03-24T18:23:00 <Bosmon> cindyli, ok thanks
2014-03-24T18:23:04 <cindyli> np
2014-03-24T18:34:48 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-03-24T18:35:01 <Bosmon> This looks like a confusion in the framework between the use of "inputPath" and "valuePath"
2014-03-24T18:37:45 <Bosmon> It seems that there is quite some confusion about which one is acceptable
2014-03-24T18:37:49 <Bosmon> kasparnet ^
2014-03-24T18:38:34 <Bosmon> So for example it looks like fluid.model.transform.accumulateStandardInputPath will just pick up inputPath
2014-03-24T18:39:02 <Bosmon> But, for example, fluid.transforms.linearScale.invert, as well as the model relay framework, expect to use "valuePath"
2014-03-24T18:40:24 <Bosmon> fluid.model.transform.doTransform looks like it only accepts inputPath
2014-03-24T18:50:57 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hmm.. yeah I can see there is quite a bit of confusion on this
2014-03-24T18:51:34 <kasparnet> I think it was originally meant for backwards compatibility/flexibility, but it seems to just be causing confusion
2014-03-24T18:52:04 <kasparnet> especially beause I believe input and value are aliased, but their "path" counterparts are not
2014-03-24T18:57:22 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-03-24T18:57:34 <Bosmon> I just put in aliasing for their paths, and it caused a further failure : P

2014-03-24T19:23:52 <cindyli> lightening fast, Bosmon. trying ...
2014-03-24T19:26:31 <Bosmon> Well, I\'m glad that the model relay system seems to be sort of stabilising
2014-03-24T19:26:40 <Bosmon> This fix was less of a mess than it could have been

2014-03-24T19:36:04 <Bosmon> It seems she is working with a more modern version of Infusion than you
2014-03-24T19:40:32 <cindyli> Bosmon: yes, btw, my 171 branch has Justin_o\'s 116 branch merged in
2014-03-24T19:40:58 <cindyli> so, 171 is depending on 116
