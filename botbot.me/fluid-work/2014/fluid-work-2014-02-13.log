2014-02-13T21:14:37 <Bosmon> hi cindyli
2014-02-13T21:15:35 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-02-13T21:15:48 <cindyli> thanks for the suggestions on direct model sharing. it\'s helpful. running into another issue. in a component structure like this: http://pastie.org/8731094
2014-02-13T21:17:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - looks ok
2014-02-13T21:17:08 <Bosmon> What is the behaviour?
2014-02-13T21:17:11 <cindyli> instantiating "fluid.metadata.audioPanel" throws that.produceTree is not a function"
2014-02-13T21:17:28 <cindyli> "that" at this point is the sub component "attributes"
2014-02-13T21:17:45 <cindyli> the problem is sourced from the modelListener on that "attributes"
2014-02-13T21:18:07 <cindyli> line 9-11
2014-02-13T21:18:44 <cindyli> wonder if the model listener to refreshView() is triggered too early?
2014-02-13T21:19:07 <cindyli> before "attributes" is ready?
2014-02-13T21:19:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - shouldn\'t be possible
2014-02-13T21:19:19 <Bosmon> Could you make up a test case?
2014-02-13T21:19:28 <cindyli> sure

2014-02-13T15:00:45 <Justin_o> clown_mtg: when you have a chance.. i\'m what your thoughts are on using aria-expanded to control something that is stripped out of the DOM.. i think it\'s usually just for things that are hidden/shown with something like display:none
2014-02-13T15:03:11 <clown_mtg> Justin_o:  acknowledged.  Yes, we can discuss later.
2014-02-13T15:03:20 <Justin_o> clown_mtg: thanks
2014-02-13T15:25:31 <Justin_o> vjoanna, danaayotte_: do you have time today to go through the PMT/PCP manual test plan with me? http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/PMT_PCP_Manual_Test_Plan
2014-02-13T15:27:02 <danaayotte_> sure Justin_o.  any time
2014-02-13T15:27:13 <vjoanna> yeah
2014-02-13T15:27:20 <Justin_o> vjoanna, danaayotte_: is now okay?

2014-02-13T15:47:14 <michelled> it\'s got the specific tasks that people are working on
2014-02-13T15:47:22 <simonjb> michelled: thanks, I\'ll take a look
2014-02-13T15:48:11 <michelled> simonjb: if you felt like picking up something small to poke at, you might want to look at the Infusion 1.5 blockers
2014-02-13T15:48:32 <michelled> we are planning an Infusion release soonish, and fixing any of those issues would be really useful
2014-02-13T15:49:15 <simonjb> michelled: I\'ll check them out, thanks
2014-02-13T15:50:11 <michelled> glancing quickly, it looks like most of them are documentation tasks :) but I suppose something like this would start to orient you to the code base: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5194

2014-02-13T16:14:02 <simonjb> clown: all good, thanks
2014-02-13T16:14:11 <clown> no problem.  cool.
2014-02-13T16:14:25 <clown> Justin_o:  you wanted to ask about aria-expanded?
2014-02-13T16:21:50 <Justin_o> clown: yes.. thanks...
2014-02-13T16:22:06 <clown> wazzup?
2014-02-13T16:22:50 <clown> btw, the idea of using aria-expanded with something stripped out of the DOM is disconcerting \xe2\x80\x94 the attribute has to be in the DOM.
2014-02-13T16:22:53 <Justin_o> does basically does it make sense to use it for cases where the controlled markup isn\'t just hidden, but is completely removed from the DOM?
2014-02-13T16:23:09 <Justin_o> okay.. yes this is what i was wondering.. i was thinking it may not apply
2014-02-13T16:23:14 <Justin_o> and what would you recommend instead
2014-02-13T16:23:47 <clown> First steps:  what is the role of the thing you want to add aria-expanded to?  Aria-expanded can only be used on a number of roles.
2014-02-13T16:24:19 <clown> http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/states_and_properties#aria-expanded
2014-02-13T16:24:30 <Justin_o> it\'s a button
2014-02-13T16:24:40 <clown> Okay.
2014-02-13T16:24:51 <clown> And the button controls some other stuff?
2014-02-13T16:24:58 <clown> The button is a toggle?
2014-02-13T16:25:38 <clown> actually, it might help if I can see this in context.  Is there an url to a demo, Justin_o?
2014-02-13T16:26:13 <Justin_o> clown: it\'s part of gpii.. there\'s no live demo that i know of.. i\'ll see if i can send you a wire frame.. if you have pmt and pcp running locally you can check it out too
2014-02-13T16:26:48 <clown> I don\'t know if pmt and pcp are running on my VM.  I could check...
2014-02-13T16:26:58 * clown launches Fedora.
2014-02-13T16:29:20 <jhernandez> clown: sorry for the intrusion, but I don\'t think so
2014-02-13T16:29:26 * michelled has quit
2014-02-13T16:29:33 <jhernandez> the PMT and PCP should be installed separately
2014-02-13T16:29:44 <clown> oh, jhernandez, thanks.
2014-02-13T16:29:45 <Justin_o> jhernandez: that\'s correct, they are install sepearately
2014-02-13T16:30:04 <clown> so, I probably have to "git" them and install them.
2014-02-13T16:34:26 <clown> jhernandez:  do you know where PMT and PCP are on github?
2014-02-13T16:36:58 <clown> is it this:  http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/states_and_properties#aria-expanded?
2014-02-13T16:37:04 <clown> whoops
2014-02-13T16:37:16 <clown> is it this:  https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors?
2014-02-13T16:37:28 <clown> jhernandez, Justin_o ^
2014-02-13T16:38:05 <jhernandez> clown: yup
2014-02-13T16:38:13 <clown> thanks.
2014-02-13T16:38:46 <jhernandez> dunno if we have \'official\' instructions
2014-02-13T16:38:57 <jhernandez> but AFAIK, you have to grab it from github
2014-02-13T16:39:02 <jhernandez> run \'npm install\'
2014-02-13T16:39:36 <jhernandez> install apache2 and serve the folder where the prefsEditor is living
2014-02-13T16:40:20 <clown> apache2?
2014-02-13T16:40:25 <clown> not node.js?

2014-02-13T17:08:14 <jhernandez> clown: yup, apache2
2014-02-13T17:08:41 <jhernandez> I assume that you already have node.js installed on that fedora box
2014-02-13T17:08:43 <jhernandez> :)
2014-02-13T17:09:08 <clown> s\'okay jhernandez,  I\'ve been working on another project anyhow.  Everyone else has gone for lunch (I should too).
2014-02-13T17:09:25 <clown> and, yes, I have node.js installed on that fedora VM.
2014-02-13T17:09:52 * clown uses my packagekit add-on to see if apache is installed.  :-)
2014-02-13T17:10:02 <jhernandez> heh
2014-02-13T17:10:13 <jhernandez> I bet that it\'ll work
2014-02-13T17:10:29 <jhernandez> :P
2014-02-13T17:12:28 <clown> interesting:  my add-on returns info only on perl-apache2 packages, jherenandez.  I checked with pkcon as well, and that returned exactly the same thing.
2014-02-13T17:12:35 * clown tries "apache".
2014-02-13T17:12:54 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-02-13T17:12:56 <jhernandez> definetly
2014-02-13T17:13:03 <jhernandez> apache will work
2014-02-13T17:13:20 <jhernandez> anyway, go for your lunch
2014-02-13T17:13:25 <jhernandez> :)
2014-02-13T17:14:30 <clown> speaking of lunch, how was you dinner?  Did it  turn out?  Did you have enough garlic?  :-)
2014-02-13T17:14:52 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-02-13T17:15:08 <clown> gah!.  Using "apache" generatees 200 results.
2014-02-13T17:15:13 <clown> time for lunch!
