2014-06-13T13:23:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: we should probably fix this issue that you've found http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5440
2014-06-13T13:23:44 <Justin_o> for the release.. i guess i'll send an update to my proposal on the list
2014-06-13T13:23:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: yes, working on it

2014-06-13T13:55:27 <cindyli> Justin_o: i submitted a pull request for 5440 issue: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/532, can you take a look?
2014-06-13T13:56:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: will do, just finishing up testing antranig's changes for the pager.
2014-06-13T13:56:16 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2014-06-13T13:57:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: although i just realized that we might have to do a larger test for it.
2014-06-13T13:58:11 <cindyli> for what?
2014-06-13T13:58:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: we'll actually have to retest everything because there was a change in databinding.js
2014-06-13T13:58:23 * clown joined the channel
2014-06-13T13:58:31 <cindyli> oh, my goodness
2014-06-13T13:58:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: for Bosmon's changes for pager
2014-06-13T13:58:36 * clown has quit
2014-06-13T13:59:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: for retest everything i basically mean run all the unit tests, smoke test all the demos, stand-alone demos, manual tests, integrations demos, and instructional demos.. in all of the platforms
2014-06-13T13:59:54 <Justin_o> and do the state tests for the pager
2014-06-13T14:01:05 <cindyli> ok. better than retesting everything on the release test plan :)
2014-06-13T14:01:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: for sure.. that would take us another week
2014-06-13T14:01:34 <cindyli> :)
2014-06-13T14:01:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: are you able to help me with the testing?
2014-06-13T14:01:40 <cindyli> certainly
2014-06-13T14:02:06 <cindyli> are you pushing the pull request for pager into the master?
2014-06-13T14:02:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. i've already done the unit tests and pager tests for safari, chrome and firefox.. did you want to start doing the smoke tests on those?
2014-06-13T14:02:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: not yet, but maybe i'll do that after i finish the pager specific tests..
2014-06-13T14:03:20 * clown joined the channel
2014-06-13T14:03:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: you can start testing from the branch on my machine.. i'll IM you a link
2014-06-13T14:03:37 <cindyli> ok
2014-06-13T14:07:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: i'm working on IE 8 testing now
2014-06-13T14:08:01 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o, me continuing with firefox
2014-06-13T14:08:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-06-13T14:08:15 <cindyli> np
2014-06-13T14:18:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: for FLUID-5440 can you make sure the fl-focus class is add appropriately to all of the prefs framework demos and manual tests.. the some kind of news one seems to be missing it as well
2014-06-13T14:18:39 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2014-06-13T14:35:07 <cindyli> Justin_o: fl-focus class is added into some kind of news demo and pushed up to the pull request for 5440. full page demos don't have and don't need this class.
2014-06-13T14:44:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-06-13T14:44:46 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have some time to help us fix FLUID-4967
2014-06-13T14:45:51 <Justin_o> jhung: you can continue on from cindyli's branch... there are a few more minor issues.. including a slight overlap of the slider on the right icon... with text maxed, verdana font, and links and input made larger.. also in the contrast themes the slider is misaligned..
2014-06-13T14:46:11 <jhung> Justin_o:  ok. I'll take a look.
2014-06-13T14:46:55 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. and you'll have to make sure you changes work in the prefsFramework demo, the UIO demo and the manual tests (full no preview, full with preview, separatedPanel, and some kind of news).
2014-06-13T14:47:39 <jhung> ok. i'll test with those Justin_o
2014-06-13T14:48:19 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-06-13T14:48:35 <Justin_o> jhung: you get bonus points for testing your changes across browsers too
2014-06-13T14:48:54 <jhung> lol Justin_o don't press your luck. ;)
2014-06-13T14:49:04 <Justin_o> jhung: lol

2014-06-13T17:05:56 <cindyli> Justin_o: i files 3 jiras regarding missing files - FLUID-5442, FLUID-5443, FLUID-5444
2014-06-13T17:07:51 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks for the fix
2014-06-13T17:07:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for the jiras

2014-06-13T19:02:41 <cindyli> Justin_o: i filed another jira regarding an issue with separated panel - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5445
2014-06-13T19:04:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you know what a sufficient amount of time needed to wait to prevent the issue from showing.. meaning how fast to you have to click to have this issue come up
2014-06-13T19:04:52 <Justin_o> ?
2014-06-13T19:06:24 <cindyli> use keyboard the clicks can happen within a second i think. that's how the issue was produced
2014-06-13T19:06:56 <Justin_o> is it reasonable to think that it will be encountered in typical usage?
2014-06-13T19:07:47 <cindyli> no, i would say
2014-06-13T19:13:03 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-06-13T19:21:35 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: any thought on if this one can wait till after the release
2014-06-13T19:21:52 <Justin_o> it seems that with typical interaction you won't trigger this bug
2014-06-13T19:22:01 <Justin_o> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5445
2014-06-13T19:22:26 <jessm> this to me is compelling logic: Justin_o: is it reasonable to think that it will be encountered in typical usage?
2014-06-13T19:22:26 <jessm> [3:07pm] cindyli: no, i would say
2014-06-13T19:22:52 <Justin_o> jessm: :)
2014-06-13T19:23:31 <anastasiac> I agree that if it's not likely to happen in typical usage, it's not something that should block our release.
2014-06-13T19:23:40 <anastasiac> my two cents...
2014-06-13T19:24:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac, jessm: thanks.. we'll push it off till after the release
