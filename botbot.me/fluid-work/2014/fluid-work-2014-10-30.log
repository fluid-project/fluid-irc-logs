2014-10-30T13:03:48 <jhung> Justin_o: I was thinking of removing the original source files for the font icons from the website repo. I think we need a strategy for maintaining the sources. So for now we just include the EOT and TTF fonts, and leave the sources out. What do you think?
2014-10-30T13:04:34 <Justin_o> jhung: sure.. i guess that makes sense.. and maybe having a separate repo would be appropriate. what do you think?
2014-10-30T13:08:11 <jhung> yes I was thinking about something along the lines of that Justin_o.
2014-10-30T13:08:40 <Justin_o> i think that makes sense
2014-10-30T13:09:07 <Justin_o> it\'s a bit of a pain to have to go back and forth between two repos, but i think it will be cleaner in the log run

2014-10-30T13:23:57 <amilchev> danaayotte: and sorry for pinging you so early
2014-10-30T13:24:04 <danaayotte> no worries
2014-10-30T13:24:25 <amilchev> don\'t know if you saw Eleni\'s email
2014-10-30T13:25:33 <danaayotte> amilchev: I see it now!
2014-10-30T13:25:41 <amilchev> in the PCP/PMT meeting notes thread, asking for help with PCP overview
2014-10-30T13:25:54 <amilchev> yeah.. I was thinking if we two could help her out
2014-10-30T13:26:21 <amilchev> I\'m asking you since she seems to be more interested in the wireframes and near future work
2014-10-30T13:26:26 <amilchev> rather than what do we have now
2014-10-30T13:29:14 <amilchev> so danaayotte whenever you have the time could you just send me the wireframes which you\'ve prepared for PCP and still haven\'t been used?
2014-10-30T13:35:25 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac: is the ePub ready to be uploaded to cachefly

2014-10-30T13:38:51 <danaayotte> amilchev: it sounds to me like Eleni is asking about what we have/are doing for review. I\'m not sure what you mean by wirefrmes that "haven\'t been used"?
2014-10-30T13:38:58 <danaayotte> We have new adjuster designs that we agreed would not be implemented for review. Is that what you are referring to?
2014-10-30T13:39:12 <danaayotte> We also had some PCP mockups that were going to be used for paper prototyping in the last round of pilot testing.
2014-10-30T13:53:04 <jhung> Justin_o: We have a version but it does not work in iBooks. I haven\'t had time to take a look at PHeT\'s fix to see if it addresses the issue.

2014-10-30T14:04:42 <amilchev> danaayotte: (sorry for delay) yes, that\'s exactly what I mean
2014-10-30T14:07:30 <danaayotte> amilchev: ok, I can point you to those
2014-10-30T14:07:31 <danaayotte> but I don\'t think that is what Eleni is asking for (she want\'s frames for review

2014-10-30T15:53:08 <amilchev> Justin_o: yes, received it but haven\'t updated my pull requests yet
2014-10-30T15:53:30 <amilchev> i could do this right after the call
2014-10-30T15:54:25 <Justin_o> amilchev: thanks, no problem, just wanted to make sure it got out

2014-10-30T17:55:44 <jhung1> Justin_o: would it be useful to have a link to both all-tests.html and the root of that directory?

2014-10-30T17:56:48 <jhung> I often see you devs hack the URL to get the directory listing, so maybe a link to the root url would be useful?

2014-10-30T18:13:26 <anastasiac> jhung and Justin_o, regarding the build site: I\xe2\x80\x99ve commented on the JIRA with the new plan, created http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5544 for the new all-tests files, linked the two JIRAs and added the new one to the iteration page

2014-10-30T19:13:27 <Bosmon> Thanks for working on this interesting impl

2014-10-30T20:07:46 <slim_jim> Bosmon: Hi, do you know if screen resolution change is enabled on Linux? I wondering how it should be invoked on windows
2014-10-30T20:08:06 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I don\'t think we have it on any platform
2014-10-30T20:08:16 <Bosmon> And I don\'t believe we\'ve done any research into how it should be triggered
2014-10-30T20:08:52 <slim_jim> Bosmon: hmm, do we have any OS settings called on  Windows at all? Wondering how to do. A command line EXE?
2014-10-30T20:09:11 <Bosmon> slim_jim - typically on Windows we invoke API calls using the node_ffi adaptation library
2014-10-30T20:09:17 <Bosmon> You can look at our existing settings handlers for examples
2014-10-30T20:09:20 <slim_jim> Bosmon: ooo eeer
2014-10-30T20:09:31 <Bosmon> For example, the registry settings handler and the SPI settings handler
2014-10-30T20:09:47 <slim_jim> Bosmon: OK thanks.

2014-10-30T20:16:26 <jhernandez> slim_jim: FYI, we support screen resolution change in GNU/Linux
2014-10-30T20:16:29 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/linux/tree/master/gpii/node_modules/xrandr
2014-10-30T20:17:54 <jhernandez> we do that with a native add-on which uses xrandr to deal with the display settings
2014-10-30T20:19:39 <slim_jim> jhernandez: so the api is to call with width and height and try to set that size if aavailable?
2014-10-30T20:19:40 <slim_jim> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/xrandr/nodexrandr/nodexrandr.cc#L299-L300
2014-10-30T20:20:05 <slim_jim> in pixels?
2014-10-30T20:20:34 <slim_jim> jhernandez: Bosmon It makes sense to harmonise across platforms
2014-10-30T20:24:28 <jhernandez> slim_jim: yeah, you pass values based on the available resolutions
2014-10-30T20:24:51 <jhernandez> but I don\'t think we can use that under windows
2014-10-30T20:24:58 <slim_jim> jhernandez: but how does the settings handler know available resolutions?
2014-10-30T20:25:03 <jhernandez> it\'s platform-specific
2014-10-30T20:25:40 <slim_jim> jhernandez: windows can do same enum Displays, enum settings set one
2014-10-30T20:25:45 <jhernandez> well, right now it doesn\'t know about it
2014-10-30T20:25:49 <slim_jim> :)
2014-10-30T20:26:23 <jhernandez> but I implemented a method to retrieve those details
2014-10-30T20:26:47 <jhernandez> basically, connected displays and available resolutions
2014-10-30T20:26:47 <slim_jim> jhernandez:  one last question - how is that code invoked from settings handlers on Linux?
2014-10-30T20:27:26 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/xrandr/xrandr_bridge.js#L22-L46
2014-10-30T20:27:40 * danaayotte_ has quit
2014-10-30T20:28:15 <slim_jim> is that node_ffi stuff witchh Bosaman says is used on win. I see you include node headers
2014-10-30T20:29:07 <jhernandez> yeah, native addons
2014-10-30T20:29:18 <jhernandez> they\'re usually written in c/c++
2014-10-30T20:29:22 <slim_jim> jhernandez:  oo err doesn;t look like settings handlers I have seen . What with Fluid?
2014-10-30T20:30:21 <jhernandez> you just write your own addons in c/c++, and make a few native calls available to node.js
2014-10-30T20:30:31 <slim_jim> All beyond me right now I\'ll get some of the others to help with that aspect once I get working code
2014-10-30T20:31:01 <jhernandez> :)
2014-10-30T20:31:38 <slim_jim> jhernandez: thanks again!
