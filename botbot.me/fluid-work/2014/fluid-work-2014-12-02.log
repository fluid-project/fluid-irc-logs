b'2014-12-02T18:41:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine you\'d just serve it up using the standard express middleware for that, for now
2014-12-02T18:41:48 <Bosmon> We don\'t currently have any particular support in kettle for this
2014-12-02T18:42:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so you think i should serve up the node_modules director?
2014-12-02T18:42:28 <Bosmon> The next issue is that the filesystem path that infusion appears at may not be predicted in advance, depending on where your module finally ends up in the larger tree of linked node modules
2014-12-02T18:42:28 <Justin_o> directory
2014-12-02T18:42:42 <Justin_o> oh :(
2014-12-02T18:42:52 <Bosmon> You can use the registered path for it which is stored in our new module loader at fluid.module.modules.infusion.baseDir
2014-12-02T18:43:10 <Bosmon> And once you have that, then you can serve up its "src" directory, yes
2014-12-02T18:43:38 <Justin_o> hmm so express will serve that up at domiain/src
2014-12-02T18:43:55 <Justin_o> but i wanted to use that for the actual src of my ui code
2014-12-02T18:44:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m sure you can arrange to mount it at infusion/src or so
2014-12-02T18:44:25 <cindyli> Bosmon: our current resourceLoader is a fundamental utility that handles file prefix and url transformation etc. both templateLoader and messageLoader are using it as a base grade. The new component in my mind is to reuse both template and message loaders for uiEnhancer. So thinking of creating a wrapper class for them so it\'s easier to be shared
2014-12-02T18:44:55 <Bosmon> cindyli - but do templateLoader and messageLoader do anything particularly useful, other than wrapping the task of resolving a URL?
2014-12-02T18:45:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: what\'s the full name of the resourceLoader.. i.e. with the namespacde
2014-12-02T18:45:40 <cindyli> "fluid.prefs.resourceLoader"
2014-12-02T18:45:58 <Bosmon> I have a feeling that our resource loading infrastructure is getting a little out of control - given we created some new wrappers to wrap the resourceLoader and are now suggesting making new wrappers to wrap the old wrappers
2014-12-02T18:47:53 <cindyli> ok. are you thinking to have one component handle both template and message loading, Bosmon
2014-12-02T18:47:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: maybe that should have just been fluid.resourceLoader
2014-12-02T18:48:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, I think we already have one component handling it.... doesn\'t the fluid.prefs.resourceLoader do it already?
2014-12-02T18:48:49 <cindyli> not really, templates and messages are usually served from different directories
2014-12-02T18:49:16 <cindyli> that\'s why we have separate instances for resourceLoader for loading them in
2014-12-02T18:50:51 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ve converted the OAuth userService to an Infusion component: https://github.com/simonbates/gpii-oauth2/blob/master/gpii-oauth2-authorization-server/userService.js
2014-12-02T18:51:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: it has a datastore subcomponent at the moment which I would like to inject instead
2014-12-02T18:51:34 <simonjb> Bosmon: would I switch to using a member? as in: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/02f97604979a98d0b648
2014-12-02T18:51:37 <Bosmon> simonjb - cool!
2014-12-02T18:51:56 <Bosmon> simonjb - no, in general injecting components as members is hazardous
2014-12-02T18:52:10 <Bosmon> You should continue to inject it as a component, and just arrange to override the definition you already have there
2014-12-02T18:52:24 <jhung> ping avtar
2014-12-02T18:53:38 <simonjb> Bosmon: what would I have in my userService for the components section?
2014-12-02T18:54:24 <Bosmon> I added a comment to the gist, I\'m not sure whether this is an idiomatic kind of interaction with gists : P
2014-12-02T18:54:50 <Bosmon> simonjb - in general the entire tree would be configured at once, and there would be a reference to the datastore injected rather than an already constructed one
2014-12-02T18:55:19 <simonjb> Bosmon: how do I reference the injected component?
2014-12-02T18:55:36 <Bosmon> If you take control of parts of construction yourself, then the framework becomes unable to reschedule the order of construction as indirect dependencies move about
2014-12-02T18:56:09 <Bosmon> simonjb - using an IoC reference of the form {context}.datastore for some context where the datastore already exists - or else literal configuration for the datastore if it doesn\'t
2014-12-02T18:56:57 <simonjb> Bosmon: feel like editing my file for me maybe in piratepad or cloning my gist and fixing? I\'m not quite following
2014-12-02T18:57:20 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure - although I guess we need to see the whole picture in order to know what to do
2014-12-02T18:57:31 <Bosmon> What\'s the ultimate site of the usage of the component you are considering?
2014-12-02T18:58:10 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/gpii-oauth2/blob/master/gpii-oauth2-authorization-server/app.js#L18
2014-12-02T18:58:11 <Bosmon> Do you see my comment on the gist? I think you need to refresh to see them since it seems the gist interface isn\'t dynamic
2014-12-02T18:58:51 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, I see, thanks
2014-12-02T18:59:41 <simonjb> Bosmon: does my userService component change?
2014-12-02T19:00:58 <Bosmon> simonjb - your userService stays as it is, but in order to make this work you will need to cascade the IoC-ification down to your "app" next
2014-12-02T19:01:22 <Bosmon> In order to allow the 3rd-party user of your app to configure the datastore attached to your userService, your app will need itself to become a component too
2014-12-02T19:01:28 <Bosmon> With the userService as a subcomponent of itself
2014-12-02T19:01:35 <Bosmon> And then the datastore as a further nested subcomponent
2014-12-02T19:02:06 <Bosmon> And so rather than manually taking control of construction of the userService at the inclusion point of app.js, this will just itself be configured in the "components" block of your app
2014-12-02T19:02:29 <Bosmon> And so the framework (and hence the upstream user) can then configure the required datastore when they make the app
2014-12-02T19:03:04 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, that makes sense; I was trying to do it step-by-step: componentize the datastore, then the serveices, then the app -- but maybe I just need to do it all now?
2014-12-02T19:04:29 <Bosmon> simonjb - well, you can stop at any point - but at whatever point you stop, there comes to be a kind of "configuration horizon" beyond which the user can\'t see
2014-12-02T19:04:44 <Bosmon> But actually this is a classically helpful usecase for IoC so you may as well continue componentizing
2014-12-02T19:05:04 <Bosmon> Since this is just the kind of issue that IoC solves - since you have the construction point of the datastore currently hardcoded on line 15
2014-12-02T19:05:18 <Bosmon> And you want instead to expose this construction point to be polymorphic
2014-12-02T19:05:25 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, agreed
2014-12-02T19:06:07 <Bosmon> However, you could get the system up and running in its current form with configuration of the kind I added in my gist comment
2014-12-02T19:06:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: my hesitation is in my inexperience with infusion and not entirely knowing how to change the app.js into a component quite
2014-12-02T19:07:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: if we could pair or such, that would really help
2014-12-02T19:07:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2014-12-02T19:07:18 <Bosmon> Let me just shut this window : P
2014-12-02T19:09:02 <simonjb> Bosmon: do you have time now?
2014-12-02T19:09:23 <simonjb> Bosmon: we can also do it tomorrow
2014-12-02T19:09:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: but I\'m thinking it would be good to do it soon -- needs to be done and may as well be sooner
2014-12-02T19:09:59 <simonjb> Bosmon: and having your assistance would really help
2014-12-02T19:11:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure yes, that would be great
2014-12-02T19:11:58 <Bosmon> Just give me 5 mins, I need to make a quick phone call
2014-12-02T19:12:11 <simonjb> Bosmon: thanks! meet you in my "room"?
2014-12-02T19:12:17 <Bosmon> yup

2014-12-02T20:26:05 <cindyli> Bosmon: continue our conversation, shall i add another set of templateLoader and messageLoader directly into pageEnhancer as subcomponents, without having another layer of wrapper for them?
2014-12-02T20:27:22 <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess you could make this into a grade which becomes used as a parent grade... but this is probably just what you were intending anyway
2014-12-02T20:27:44 <cindyli> haha
2014-12-02T20:28:02 <Bosmon> Perhaps a clue to the name for this could be found in whatever it is you expect is common between all those components which have both templates and messages
2014-12-02T20:28:09 <Bosmon> What are they all?
2014-12-02T20:28:48 <cindyli> they are as you said, to load templates and messages
2014-12-02T20:28:55 <avtar> jhung: that was just a redirect pointing to http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail so we should be fine
2014-12-02T20:30:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: how do you think about what anastasiac has suggested: resourceManager
2014-12-02T20:30:53 <cindyli> fileLoader
2014-12-02T20:31:06 <cindyli> resourceManager sounds nice and fancy to me :)

2014-12-02T16:28:11 <Justin_o> andres_malarres: i guess you question is about your comments from above.
2014-12-02T16:28:19 <Justin_o> unfortunately i\'m not sure i can help you with that
2014-12-02T16:29:00 <Justin_o> i\'m not entirely sure what the question is though
2014-12-02T16:29:05 <andres_malarres> maybe a general help with infusion
2014-12-02T16:29:18 <andres_malarres> after     gpii.request.flowManager.getPreferences = function (preferencesDataSource, event, token) {
2014-12-02T16:29:18 <andres_malarres> preferencesDataSource.get({
2014-12-02T16:29:18 <andres_malarres> token: token

2014-12-02T17:14:11 <Justin_o> andres_malarres: sorry i didn\'t get back here in time. next time could you also put the code in a pastebin or pastie so that it is easier to read. I\'m not really sure what the exact question is though. If it\'s about "gpii.request.flowManager.getPreferences" then it looks like it just defers to the preferencesDataSource\'s get method. which takes a directModel
2014-12-02T17:14:11 <Justin_o> "{token: token"}" which is used to find a resource in the dataSource and a callback. In this case it\'s the function returned by the call to gpii.request.flowManager.logAndNotify

2014-12-02T18:35:51 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, Bosmon or Bosmon7, i\'m creating a new component for the prefs framework. It has "templateLoader" and "messageLoader" as subcomponents. basically it\'s in charge of all async loadings required by prefs framework. Can you think of a good name for it?
2014-12-02T18:36:31 <Justin_o> file loader?
2014-12-02T18:36:31 <anastasiac> cindyli, the name \xe2\x80\x9cresourceLoader\xe2\x80\x9d comes to mind. Do we already have that?
2014-12-02T18:36:42 <Justin_o> actually i like that better
2014-12-02T18:36:49 <cindyli> we already have that name
2014-12-02T18:36:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: if you\'re around i have another question for you
2014-12-02T18:36:57 <anastasiac> what does it do, cindyli?
2014-12-02T18:37:14 <cindyli> both templateLoader and messageLoader are instances of "resourceLoader"
2014-12-02T18:37:25 <cindyli> anastasiac: ^
2014-12-02T18:37:30 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2014-12-02T18:38:16 <anastasiac> ah. nm
2014-12-02T18:38:17 <anastasiac> hm
2014-12-02T18:38:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in work on the authorization ui\'s, i\'m using infusion. simonjb is also using infusion for the server part. do we have a strategy to share the instance of infusion. he has it pulled in by npm, mine needs to be served so that it is accessible by the browser
2014-12-02T18:39:31 <anastasiac> cindyli, it might have to be fileLoader\xe2\x80\xa6 or maybe resourceManager?
2014-12-02T18:39:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m wondering why we need a new component for this purpose, when we already have resourceLoader?
2014-12-02T18:40:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, we can share the infusion although of course for a real production use we might want a build
2014-12-02T18:40:17 <Bosmon> But sharing the instance would be very convenient during development
2014-12-02T18:40:27 <Justin_o> agree to both
2014-12-02T18:40:36 <Justin_o> but how will i serve up the unbuilt version
2014-12-02T18:41:00 <Justin_o> or should we add a grunt task to build and extract the one from node_modules
