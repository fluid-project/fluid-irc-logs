2014-11-14T15:05:55 <jhung> anastasiac: I updated the fluid project site pull request. Thanks for catching those problems. :)
2014-11-14T15:06:06 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have another look
2014-11-14T15:23:19 <jhung> Justin_o: I have an updated EPUB to put onto the CDN. How do I do this? Or should I send it to you?
2014-11-14T15:26:45 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have access to the CDN if not you can send it to me
2014-11-14T15:28:48 <jhung> I don\'t have access Justin_o. I\'ll send it to you.

2014-11-14T15:59:18 <anastasiac> jhung, can you remind me how the fluidproject.org domain ultimately ends up referencing the gh-pages branch in the main repo? What has to be set where?
2014-11-14T16:00:26 <anastasiac> this might be a question for avtar
2014-11-14T16:02:40 <anastasiac> jhung, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the fluidproject.org deployed to your gh-pages branch. What\xe2\x80\x99s the url I should use to view that deployment? is it http://jhung.github.io/fluidproject.org/ ?
2014-11-14T16:05:45 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, that URL I pasted should work, and I am seeing the content, but not the styles. :-(
2014-11-14T16:06:30 <jhung> anastasiac: same. Let me see\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-11-14T16:07:20 <anastasiac> jhung, it might be a case-sensitivity issue. The actual infusion folder is upper-case Infusion, but the links reference lower-case infusion
2014-11-14T16:07:45 <jhung> ah good catch. Let me fix that anastasiac
2014-11-14T16:10:15 <anastasiac> jhung, it\xe2\x80\x99s also getting errors trying to access the google fonts\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-11-14T16:10:45 <jhung> ok anastasiac I\'ll take a look.
2014-11-14T16:43:46 <Justin_o> jhung: was there a jira for uploading the epub to the CDN?
2014-11-14T16:47:20 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac: I uploaded the EPUB to the CDN and left a comment on FLOE-222
2014-11-14T16:47:46 <Justin_o> i didn\'t close it yet because of the open pull request mentioned on the floe iteration page and not sure if you need to update links to the new location.
2014-11-14T16:47:47 <Justin_o> https://idrc.cachefly.net/floeproject.org/ebooks/InclusiveEPUB-physics.epub
2014-11-14T16:47:59 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to update some links
2014-11-14T16:58:46 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac: I\'ll update that link now.

2014-11-14T17:23:06 <Justin_o> anastasiac: when you upgraded an integration to the latest version of the prefsFramework, did you have any trouble with the pages existing font icons in the various contrast themes?
2014-11-14T17:23:59 <anastasiac> Not that I noticed, Justin_o, but I might not be understanding your question
2014-11-14T17:24:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. thanks.. could be something with the implementation for the exploration tool
2014-11-14T17:25:02 <Justin_o> trying to upgrade it to the latest infusion, but when I switch to a contrast theme the font icons that were used in the page disapper

2014-11-14T19:06:10 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ve updated the fluid website. The path issues are fixed and the font should work. Let me know if there are issues still.
2014-11-14T19:06:17 <anastasiac> k, thanks jhung

2014-11-14T20:06:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: did we rename the classes used by the prefs framework for thumbing?
2014-11-14T20:06:41 <Justin_o> theming
2014-11-14T20:07:48 <cindyli> Justin_o: we removed the classes for fonts that start with fl-prefEditor-\xe2\x80\xa6 since they are never in use
2014-11-14T20:07:56 <Justin_o> okay
2014-11-14T20:08:07 <Justin_o> but the themes are still fl-theme-prefsEditor-yb and etc
2014-11-14T20:09:09 <Justin_o> oh it looks like they aren\'t like that anymore... are they just fl-theem-yb now
2014-11-14T20:09:23 <cindyli> checking..
