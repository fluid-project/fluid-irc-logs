2014-05-14T19:40:48 <michelled> Bosmon: were you expecting cindyli1 to do FLUID-5368?
2014-05-14T19:41:28 <Bosmon> michelled - of course not
2014-05-14T19:41:48 <michelled> sorry - I meant did you want her do to something with it? it looks like you assigned it to her on Monday
2014-05-14T19:43:30 <Bosmon> michelled - I don\'t think that\'s right
2014-05-14T19:43:40 <Bosmon> I haven\'t touched it yet
2014-05-14T19:43:48 <michelled> oh, weird - I\'ll assign it back to you then
2014-05-14T19:44:01 <Bosmon> Actually I am dreaming it will miraculously "go away" once I have a proper fix for FLUID-5361
2014-05-14T19:44:13 <Bosmon> I am finding that the current model for committing relays is entirely incorrect
2014-05-14T19:44:30 <Bosmon> And has only seemed to work because we have never had terribly many of them
2014-05-14T19:45:39 <michelled> interesting - it\'s good it got uncovered now
2014-05-14T19:46:25 <Bosmon> I managed to get all the FLUID-5361 tests passing by themselves, but they have now provoked a horrible failure in an unrelated test
2014-05-14T19:46:37 <Bosmon> Hopefully the new model will be easier to understand as well
2014-05-14T19:46:45 <Bosmon> I always got completely lost in all this "preCommit" nonsense
2014-05-14T19:47:02 <Bosmon> Time and time again the words of my old maths teacher come to mind
2014-05-14T19:47:16 <Bosmon> "You know the bit that you think is particularly clever - that\'s the bit that\'s wrong!"
2014-05-14T19:47:23 <michelled> ha!
2014-05-14T19:47:57 <michelled> Bosmon: if you get a chance, can you let Justin_o know what needs to \x1chappen to fix FLUID-5364, he has some time to fix it now, but isn\'t sure where to start
2014-05-14T19:48:29 <Bosmon> Well, he can just choose either of the two models for reporting errors that he likes
2014-05-14T19:48:36 <Bosmon> And make sure that the file is consistent with it : P
2014-05-14T19:48:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2014-05-14T19:48:46 <Justin_o> sounds good
2014-05-14T19:48:57 <Bosmon> I think that the model using the global function is probably marginally preferable
2014-05-14T19:49:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2014-05-14T19:49:08 <Bosmon> Given our recent discoveries about inlining
2014-05-14T19:49:22 <Bosmon> We should try to avoid bound functions wherever we can, especially in framework code
2014-05-14T19:58:41 <Justin_o> michelled: I\'ve filed a new pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/519
2014-05-14T19:58:54 <michelled> thx Justin_o

2014-05-14T15:36:12 <colinclark> I had a super-scattered day yesterday
2014-05-14T15:36:15 <colinclark> THAT PULL REQUEST
2014-05-14T15:36:18 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry
2014-05-14T15:37:25 <jhernandez> colinclark: heh, no prob
2014-05-14T15:38:12 <jhernandez> if you can\'t get to it before pilots I can just add this patch to our linux rpm
2014-05-14T15:38:24 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it today, guaranteed
2014-05-14T15:38:35 <jhernandez> B-)
2014-05-14T15:38:40 <jhernandez> colinclark: ok ok
2014-05-14T15:38:43 <jhernandez> thanks!
2014-05-14T15:38:51 <colinclark> man, I wish I was wearing sunglasses like that
2014-05-14T15:38:55 <colinclark> you have the coolest emoticons
2014-05-14T15:38:57 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-05-14T15:40:03 <jhernandez> colinclark: btw, I\'m curious
2014-05-14T15:40:07 <jhernandez> are you in Linz?
2014-05-14T15:40:14 <colinclark> no
2014-05-14T15:40:16 <jhernandez> ok ok
2014-05-14T15:40:18 <colinclark> I attended virtually yesterday
2014-05-14T15:40:29 <colinclark> today I slept in really late, so I\xe2\x80\x99m pretending I\xe2\x80\x99m in California
2014-05-14T15:40:34 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2014-05-14T15:40:43 <jhernandez> or in Boulder
2014-05-14T15:42:20 <clown> jhernandez:  Hi!
2014-05-14T15:42:22 <clown> and thanks.
2014-05-14T15:43:22 * michelled has quit
2014-05-14T15:43:43 <jhernandez> clown: as a brief resume, not so many updates on our device reporter stuff
2014-05-14T15:44:14 <jhernandez> only addressed some comments from Antranig on https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49

2014-05-14T15:44:57 <jhernandez> remaining comments are related to findSearchPk.js file
2014-05-14T15:46:02 <clown> jhernandez:  that\'s the one that just caught my eye.
2014-05-14T15:46:11 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-05-14T15:46:11 <clown> or, rather "ones"
2014-05-14T15:46:25 <clown> I can look more closely after the arch meeting.
2014-05-14T15:46:34 <jhernandez> since you wrote that code I was wondering if you could address these
2014-05-14T15:46:41 <clown> yes.
2014-05-14T15:46:45 <jhernandez> cool
2014-05-14T15:46:48 <jhernandez> thanks!
2014-05-14T15:46:49 <jhernandez> :)
2014-05-14T15:46:53 <clown> no problem.
2014-05-14T15:49:47 <clown> jhernandez:  Just catching up as much as possible \xe2\x80\x94 I\'ve pulled your latest changes to "linux".
2014-05-14T15:49:55 <clown> Is there anything in universal?
2014-05-14T15:50:07 * clown looks
2014-05-14T15:50:09 <jhernandez> nope
2014-05-14T15:50:59 <clown> jhernandez:   cool, thanks.
2014-05-14T15:51:15 <jhernandez> nothing changed on the universal side (device-reporter-draft-2 branch)
2014-05-14T15:52:19 <clown> jhernandez:   possibly quick question:  when I make the fixes to findSearchPkg.js, where should I put the changes?
2014-05-14T15:53:06 <jhernandez> on linux\' device-reporter-draft-2 branch
2014-05-14T15:53:35 <clown> okay
2014-05-14T15:55:25 <jhernandez> as usually, you have to open a pull request against that branch, and once I accept it, https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/49 will be updated
2014-05-14T15:55:37 <jhernandez> (automagically)
2014-05-14T15:55:39 <jhernandez> :P
2014-05-14T15:56:01 <clown> jhernandez:  I may need to ask for details and little hand holding later.
2014-05-14T15:56:03 <clown> :-)
2014-05-14T15:58:24 <colinclark> oh hey jhernandez
2014-05-14T15:58:48 <colinclark> Did Manuel\xe2\x80\x99s email to the list make sense to you?
2014-05-14T15:58:50 <colinclark> where he says
2014-05-14T15:58:56 <colinclark> \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a meeting with the Android team about their plans for year 3, and one of the main requests that came out is that they needed a clear way to communicate with the Flow Manager\xe2\x80\x9d
2014-05-14T15:59:10 <jhernandez> colinclark: well, yes and no
2014-05-14T16:00:14 <jhernandez> in order to address some of the goals for this year 3, we all need a way to "chat" with the flowManager
2014-05-14T16:00:35 <jhernandez> ie: native notifications
2014-05-14T16:01:22 <jhernandez> we need to define a way to connect to the flowManager and keep the system listening to that notifications
2014-05-14T16:01:30 <jhernandez> *those
2014-05-14T16:01:33 <colinclark> what kinds of notifications?
2014-05-14T16:02:13 <jhernandez> ie: user x has been logged in
2014-05-14T16:02:53 <jhernandez> but I\'m not specially worried about SP3-related developments
2014-05-14T16:03:21 <jhernandez> but worried about matchmakers, PCP/PMT, context, etc
2014-05-14T16:03:48 <jhernandez> another example
2014-05-14T16:03:53 * sgithens has quit
2014-05-14T16:04:00 <jhernandez> environmental changes
2014-05-14T16:04:42 <jhernandez> the CAS is going to chat to with the flowManager, but this CAS will take care of the motes that are connected to that CAS
2014-05-14T16:05:27 <jhernandez> in Android, we can report some environmental changes such as luminosity
2014-05-14T16:05:28 <jhung> Justin_o: ran into a technical issue w the SVG. Confluence does not support SVG as an image type. It only shows it as a link and not render it out.
2014-05-14T16:05:43 <jhernandez> so we would need a similar mechanism to talk to the flowManager, isn\'t it?
2014-05-14T16:05:59 <jhernandez> btw, arch meeting time ...
2014-05-14T16:06:32 <jhung> maybe there\'s plugin for displaying SVGs, but I did a quick look and there didn\'t seem to be any in their plugin collection.
2014-05-14T16:08:47 <jhung> actually, there may be a solution, but requires configuration of Confluence. Maybe avtar can look at this? https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/display/info/How+to+display+SVG+attachments+in+Confluence
2014-05-14T16:09:26 <Justin_o> jhung: it\'s okay, the new image will be used in the new space anyways, and not in confluence
2014-05-14T16:10:06 <jhung> ah fantastic. Where should the image go Justin_o? I assume we have a repo?
2014-05-14T16:11:00 <Justin_o> jhung: it will end up going into the infusion-docs repo, but i an commit it with the page i\'m converting.. can you send me a copy
2014-05-14T16:11:10 <Justin_o> by the way, what\'s the file size compared to the original?
2014-05-14T16:12:09 <jhung> 41KB original PNG vs. 53KB SVG Justin_o
2014-05-14T16:12:56 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. not too much bigger
2014-05-14T16:13:53 <jhung> I\'m sure I could have made it smaller Justin_o, but I used some curvy arrows which adds to the bits. :)
2014-05-14T16:14:36 <Justin_o> jhung: so fancy :)
