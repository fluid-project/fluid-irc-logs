b'2014-11-11T19:51:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - those first 3 methods seem like duplicates to me
2014-11-11T19:51:28 <Justin_o> they\'re pretty similar yes.. i haven\'t gotten around to the refactoring bit yet
2014-11-11T19:51:34 <Justin_o> just trying to get things working first

2014-11-11T19:55:15 <Justin_o> here\'s an updated inovkeWithDelay that records the resolved promises.
2014-11-11T19:55:20 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Fo1INyHn
2014-11-11T19:56:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that looks reasonable
2014-11-11T19:58:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-11-11T19:59:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - although I think you need to push a bit more into the fireRecord?
2014-11-11T19:59:39 <Bosmon> For example material to record what the request\'s ID was
2014-11-11T19:59:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what is a requests ID
2014-11-11T20:00:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you made an ID field there
2014-11-11T20:00:41 <Bosmon> Remember that it was important to record which requests resolve and which don\'t
2014-11-11T20:00:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. that is going into the fireRecord
2014-11-11T20:01:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: line 16 push (val.value)
2014-11-11T20:01:20 <Justin_o> where value is the ID
2014-11-11T20:01:29 <Justin_o> that was generated by the ++count
2014-11-11T20:01:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how does value come to be the ID?
2014-11-11T20:02:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s in the request type.. the promise returns an object that looks like {operations: "get", "value": options.ID}
2014-11-11T20:02:50 <Justin_o> although operation should probably be request
2014-11-11T20:02:57 <Justin_o> or type or something
2014-11-11T20:03:09 <Justin_o> i could also change the property value to be called ID
2014-11-11T20:03:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I see, the first pastebin is still valid
2014-11-11T20:03:46 <Justin_o> so the fireRecord will look something like {set: [0, 1], get: [0, 3], delete: [0, 4]}
2014-11-11T20:04:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. sorry.. i didn\'t fully replace it all
2014-11-11T20:04:35 <Justin_o> i\'ll remove the duplications from the request implementations after I get some passing tessts
2014-11-11T20:04:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2014-11-11T20:05:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does it look like i\'m on the right direction?
2014-11-11T20:05:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I think so
2014-11-11T20:05:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great thanks.. when i have some tests in place i\'ll update the pull request

2014-11-11T17:52:37 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. will have a look soon
2014-11-11T17:53:44 <cindyli> Justin_o: as the infusion fss has been replaced by fluid.css and normalize.css. do you think if we should add normalize lib into prefsEditors repo?
2014-11-11T17:55:04 <Justin_o> ;(
2014-11-11T17:55:10 <Justin_o> that\'s going to be a lot of work
2014-11-11T17:55:26 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2014-11-11T17:55:35 <Justin_o> judging by what it took me to get the header colours changed
2014-11-11T17:56:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: but i guess we should ty
2014-11-11T17:56:32 <Justin_o> try
2014-11-11T17:56:40 <Justin_o> but there may be a bunch of styling changes needed
2014-11-11T17:56:54 <Justin_o> i also have to fix FLUID-5553 so that normalize.css is included in a build
2014-11-11T17:57:04 <Justin_o> do you have a few minutes or so to wait for me to make that change?
2014-11-11T17:57:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2014-11-11T17:57:18 <cindyli> sure
2014-11-11T17:58:41 <cindyli> Justin_o: why would it be a lot of work for the normalize lib to work with prefsEditors?
2014-11-11T17:59:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: it looks like they are using the base, reset, and layout files from FSS in the PMT and PCP themselves, so the styles that they were built upon will have changed
2014-11-11T18:00:09 <Justin_o> hopefully it won\'t be too different though
2014-11-11T18:00:20 <cindyli> ok

2014-11-11T19:49:40 <Justin_o> the tests arg in that last method would look something like {get: [20, 22, 40], set: [10, 32]}
