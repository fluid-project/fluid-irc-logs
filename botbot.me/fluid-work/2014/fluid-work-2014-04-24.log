b'2014-04-24T19:03:32 <Bosmon> But I imagine the sequence is something like i) some bound markup triggers a model change, ii) model change triggers a refresh, iii) refresh destroys block of markup and component associated with i) through re-rendering, iv) a further listener then executes as part of the same loop still executing for i)
2014-04-24T19:04:01 <Bosmon> And this would explain why having a redundant refreshView call might provoke the issue since it means that a further listener is hanging around in the loop waiting to be notified for iv)

2014-04-24T19:06:16 <Bosmon> It\'s particularly awkward since we can\'t deal with the issue in some more principled way by just ensuring that we deregister the DOM listener when the component is destroyed - which we probably do indeed even do
2014-04-24T19:06:43 <Bosmon> Since we have ALREADY started handling its event during the sequence where it is destroyed
2014-04-24T19:07:04 <Bosmon> That is, at the time the event listener loop starts, the DOM element exists, but by the time it finishes, it has gone

2014-04-24T19:07:41 <jhung> vjoanna: is the floe story AI file somewhere I can access? I want to create themed versions of it to work with UIO.
2014-04-24T19:08:27 <Bosmon> YOu can see this in firebug during your failure, Justin_o - if you look down at "applyBoundChange" at the bottom of the event stack, the DOM element from which the change is fired is one of the sickly greyed-out kind that is no longer in the document
2014-04-24T19:08:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: grey zombie DOM element
2014-04-24T19:09:02 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-04-24T19:09:05 <Bosmon> One of those
2014-04-24T19:09:15 <vjoanna> jhung: yes, it\'s here: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/24945059/floe-tools.pdf?api=v2
2014-04-24T19:09:30 <jhung> great thanks vjoanna
2014-04-24T19:09:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so it\'s not exactly the DOM element that is the problem though, but the lingering component that had been at some point bound to it?
2014-04-24T19:10:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well the problem is more at the DOM element end rather than at the component end - but I guess the issue could actually arise in any context, where you have a listener bound to some THING of any kind, which as part of its action destroys that THING
2014-04-24T19:11:01 <Bosmon> The markup and the component actually arrange to destroy both of themselves in the proper way
2014-04-24T19:11:14 <Bosmon> So really, at the time of the failure, both of them are properly non-existing
2014-04-24T19:11:34 <Bosmon> The problem is, we still haven\'t finished notifying the list of listeners which were in progress for the original event
2014-04-24T19:12:02 <Bosmon> And the remaining ones are then presented with the combination of a "zombie DOM element" plus a "zombie component"
2014-04-24T19:12:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah
2014-04-24T19:12:46 <Bosmon> So both of these things have been properly destroyed "in sync"
2014-04-24T19:12:55 <Bosmon> But, nonetheless, they have been destroyed : P
2014-04-24T19:13:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the fix will be around deregistering events before destroying? or having the listeners not try to act on something that doesn\'t exist anymore?
2014-04-24T19:14:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the former wouldn\'t help, by the explanation above
2014-04-24T19:14:35 <Bosmon> Any attempt to deregister things would be "too late"
2014-04-24T19:14:44 <Bosmon> And in fact we do indeed register them
2014-04-24T19:14:49 <Bosmon> er deregister them
2014-04-24T19:14:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you couldn\'t just drop the queue?
2014-04-24T19:15:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess the events are all mixed up with ones that are legitimate
2014-04-24T19:15:16 <Bosmon> Well, you can\'t "drop" it because at the bottom of your stack is a piece of JavaScript code which is in the middle of a loop iterating over it
2014-04-24T19:15:26 <Bosmon> This is GOING to complete, come what may : P
2014-04-24T19:15:46 <Bosmon> In this case, the loop is actually in jQuery\'s own code
2014-04-24T19:15:59 <Bosmon> Inside jQuery\'s "dispatch" method
2014-04-24T19:16:09 <Justin_o> because it\'s a DOM event
2014-04-24T19:16:12 <Bosmon> It is GOING to notify all the listeners you gave it, regardless of what else happens : P
2014-04-24T19:17:15 <Bosmon> Perhaps the simplest fix might be in the renderer\'s code, yes
2014-04-24T19:17:28 <Bosmon> Although I should think a bit what the implications might be
2014-04-24T19:18:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. could be. I think i used it as a work around when i ran into similar issues
2014-04-24T19:18:49 <Bosmon> It seems that it is the proper place for it in general, since this issue is caused mostly through the lack of a proper renderer in any case
2014-04-24T19:20:11 <Justin_o> :)
2014-04-24T19:20:20 <Justin_o> but those changes weren\'t expected till post 1.5
2014-04-24T19:20:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2014-04-24T19:21:01 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s not really a proper fix
2014-04-24T19:21:24 <Bosmon> It\'s just the proper place for it since all of this code will be swept away, along with the fix, when we rewrite the renderer in the future
2014-04-24T19:21:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. so for now it will only address cases where the renderer was used
2014-04-24T19:21:59 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-04-24T19:22:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2014-04-24T19:22:15 <Bosmon> Other cases of "listener causing destruction of the thing it is listening to" should be more obvious
2014-04-24T19:22:40 <Bosmon> Especially once we have the FLUID-4890 fix which gives the name of the thing which was destroyed
2014-04-24T19:22:59 <Justin_o> yes.. that would be helpful
2014-04-24T19:24:15 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-04-24T19:24:45 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ANTRANIIIIIIQUE!!!
2014-04-24T19:25:49 <Bosmon> kasparnet - DAMMMNNN YYOOOOUUUU....... KASSPPPAAAARNEEEEEEETT!
2014-04-24T19:26:10 <kasparnet> hehe hello dr. dr. bosmon
2014-04-24T19:26:15 <kasparnet> I\'m here to bug you about a bug
2014-04-24T19:26:49 <kasparnet> http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-702
2014-04-24T19:27:00 <kasparnet> the one I was also talking about at last arch meeting
2014-04-24T19:27:25 <kasparnet> I read through the documentation, and tried a bunch of different references out, but nothing seems to be working
2014-04-24T19:27:46 <kasparnet> (or well, something seems to be working, but I cant get hold of the MM as I need to)
2014-04-24T19:28:14 <kasparnet> I can get the MatchMakerProxy component (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/pilots2/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/configs/pilot2.json) line 2
2014-04-24T19:28:22 <kasparnet> but it doesn\'t contain the components I need
2014-04-24T19:29:04 <Bosmon> You\'re right
2014-04-24T19:29:15 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t!
2014-04-24T19:29:24 <Bosmon> You will need to put the components you need in a place where you can actually find them
2014-04-24T19:36:52 <kasparnet> hmmm.. so why isn\'t the current location a suitable place to put the component... it seems to work in the normal config
2014-04-24T19:37:10 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/pilots2/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/configs/development.json

2014-04-24T19:39:04 * jhung has quit
2014-04-24T19:39:28 <Bosmon> Well obviously IT WORKS
2014-04-24T19:39:36 <Bosmon> Because you are not trying to refer to it from somewhere else : P
2014-04-24T19:39:53 <Bosmon> What kind of conception of "IT SEEMS TO WORK" is this : P
2014-04-24T19:40:10 <Bosmon> "If I don\'t try to use it in a way for which the definition is unsuitable, it seems to work" : P
2014-04-24T19:42:10 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hehe, well - they\'re so damn similar those two configs, so I dont understand why one is suitable and the other is not
2014-04-24T19:43:00 <Justin_o> cindyli, michelled: I\'ve filed a pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/498 could one of you please review it?
2014-04-24T19:43:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet - did you read the documentation page on how context resolution works?
2014-04-24T19:43:39 <Bosmon> It explains which components you should expect to be able to refer to from what locations

2014-04-24T19:53:24 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I did read the documentation, yeah, but I still haven\'t been able to figure out where i\'m going wrong
2014-04-24T19:53:59 <Bosmon> kasparnet - did you follow the diagram with the white, green and yellow squares?
2014-04-24T19:54:07 <Bosmon> Try to map this onto your situation
2014-04-24T19:55:14 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hmmm... so does this have to do with the component name "server"?
2014-04-24T19:55:42 <kasparnet> I guess the flowmanager and MM would be at the same level
2014-04-24T19:55:43 <Bosmon> kasparnet - it has to do with where the reference is from, and what it is trying to refer to
2014-04-24T19:55:56 <Bosmon> it\'s quite a familiar model since it is the one that every standard programming language uses : P
2014-04-24T19:56:10 <Bosmon> Imagine you had tried to refer to a variable written in one function from a place inside another one
2014-04-24T19:57:26 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ugh, ok, I think I see the problem now ... I guess it didn\'t fully dawn on me that all these configs are accumulutative (or rather that all this stuff is created within the same server component)
2014-04-24T20:01:05 <Bosmon> I guess this is one the KETTLE oddities that perhaps didn\'t get completely documented
2014-04-24T20:01:32 <kasparnet> Bosmon: but then I\'m pretty fucked if I wanna actually refer to some of the regular (non-proxy) matchmaker functions
2014-04-24T20:01:50 <Bosmon> kasparnet - this is why you will need to move them out
2014-04-24T20:03:25 <kasparnet> well - but if the MM need its own ports their outermost level would have to be at a sister level of the "server" component
2014-04-24T20:03:38 <kasparnet> s/their/its/
2014-04-24T20:03:54 <kasparnet> which makes it impossible to refer to its subcomponents
2014-04-24T20:04:14 <kasparnet> hmmm... do you have time for a quick call Bosmon
2014-04-24T20:04:32 <avtar> Bosmon: http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture
2014-04-24T20:04:46 <avtar> is that better than \'view\'?
2014-04-24T20:05:05 <kasparnet> YAY Avtar!!
2014-04-24T20:05:12 <avtar> hi kasparnet
2014-04-24T20:05:26 <kasparnet> so pretty with the new URL
2014-04-24T20:05:34 <avtar> shiny
2014-04-24T20:05:43 <avtar> old urls should still work

2014-04-24T20:06:07 <kasparnet> cool!
2014-04-24T20:06:59 <Bosmon> avtar - that\'s nice - shouldn\'t we just use the standard "wiki" that the docs and everyone else recommend?
2014-04-24T20:07:43 <avtar> i can change it to that
2014-04-24T20:07:51 <avtar> just didn\'t since wiki is already part of the url
2014-04-24T20:15:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon: seeing how this is really pressing and it\'s only for the flowmanager, which we will have to (partly at least) rewrite anyway, I might just throw in a hack for this for the pilot2 branch
2014-04-24T20:16:36 <Bosmon> kasparnet - on a docs call right now, can chat in a bit

b'2014-04-24T17:28:52 <Justin_o> you can see the issue by running the demo.. after a video is added change the selection of the radio buttons in the Audio panel to get the error
2014-04-24T17:28:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2014-04-24T17:29:50 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2014-04-24T17:31:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: np, sorry i didn\'t get the unit test in.. i guess my assumptions about what is exactly causing the issue aren\'t quite correct
2014-04-24T17:31:33 <Bosmon> The suggestion is that it is something nasty
2014-04-24T17:32:09 * kasparnet has quit
2014-04-24T17:32:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it might just be an over site on my part
2014-04-24T17:32:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - even if it is, it ought to be impossible :)
2014-04-24T17:32:53 <Justin_o> and the code around that is a bit complex
2014-04-24T17:33:03 <Justin_o> ah right, i forgot you had mentioned that
2014-04-24T17:33:16 <Bosmon> Just as when DOCKTOUR JOHNSON was once told that "playing the violin was difficult"
2014-04-24T17:33:27 <Bosmon> He replied "DIFFICULT, SIR? I wish it were IMPOSSIBLE!"
2014-04-24T17:33:41 <avtar> Bosmon: why was his keyboard broken?
2014-04-24T17:34:02 <Bosmon> Ah great avtar, you are here :)
2014-04-24T17:34:14 <avtar> i\'m always here.....
2014-04-24T17:34:25 <Bosmon> I was wondering whether I could tackle you about the "index.php" issue in the URLs for our GPII wiki
2014-04-24T17:34:34 <Bosmon> Do you think it would be possible to remove this URL segment?
2014-04-24T17:34:39 <avtar> sure
2014-04-24T17:34:44 <Bosmon> That would be really marvellous
2014-04-24T17:34:53 <Bosmon> Since it creates a sort of unsightly impression to our partners
2014-04-24T17:35:48 * vjoanna joined the channel
2014-04-24T17:38:14 <avtar> Bosmon: so something like http://wiki.gpii.net/view/Architecture ?
2014-04-24T17:39:13 <Bosmon> avtar - can we do even without the "view"?
2014-04-24T17:39:40 <avtar> mediawiki docs seem to suggest adhering to that path
2014-04-24T17:40:05 <avtar> http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL#URL_like_-_example.com.2FPage_title
2014-04-24T17:41:36 <Bosmon> Well isn\'t it odd that they don\'t adhere to it themselves? :)
2014-04-24T17:42:01 <avtar> they kinda do
2014-04-24T17:42:13 <avtar> except they use \'wiki\'
2014-04-24T17:42:33 <avtar> as does wikipedia
2014-04-24T17:42:36 <Bosmon> Ok
2014-04-24T17:42:38 <Bosmon> let\'s use that then
2014-04-24T17:44:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there seems to be an error in the include structure for the page resource.html
2014-04-24T17:44:49 <Bosmon> You have included "resourceInputPanel" rather than "resourceInputPanel.js" which causes an error on startup
2014-04-24T17:45:49 <Justin_o> :(
2014-04-24T17:46:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - other than this I seem to be able to use the audio buttons fine
2014-04-24T17:46:10 <Bosmon> Can you give me a more detailed set of instructions?
2014-04-24T17:47:17 <Bosmon> I press "OK" after adding a video and nothing happens
2014-04-24T17:47:30 <Bosmon> But I don\'t get any failures after fixing the script path
2014-04-24T17:49:44 <Justin_o> thanks for catching that.. i\'ll fix it.. it seems that my web server doesn\'t mind missing extensions
2014-04-24T17:49:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'ve pushed up the fix for the include
2014-04-24T17:50:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i still have the same error though... are you using the "Climate Change Impacts" or "Create new resource" both should fail but it will help me to know where you are at
2014-04-24T17:51:00 <Bosmon> I am using "Create new resource"
2014-04-24T17:51:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. so first step is to add a video.. it doesn\'t have to be a real video just something in the textfield at the top
2014-04-24T17:51:42 <Justin_o> and press okay
2014-04-24T17:51:51 <Justin_o> which should bring up the panels under video details
2014-04-24T17:52:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yup
2014-04-24T17:52:38 <Justin_o> in the audio panel the first radio button should be selected. Change this to either of the other ones and you should get an error
2014-04-24T17:52:44 <Justin_o> i\'m using firefox by the way
2014-04-24T17:53:03 <Bosmon> aha, got it
2014-04-24T17:53:10 <Bosmon> I had been using the checkboxes rather than the radio buttons
2014-04-24T17:53:34 <Justin_o> ah yah.. that\'s a bit confusing
2014-04-24T17:59:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, horrifyingly I think this issue might well be related to FLUID-4890
2014-04-24T17:59:10 <Bosmon> So it is timely that this has just come up :)
2014-04-24T17:59:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - btw, I just found myself using some techniques from this page I just wrote ...... http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Tips+for+Debugging
2014-04-24T18:01:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right.. i have that on my list of pages to read.. haven\'t gotten a chance to read that yet, but maybe i should do so sooner than later
2014-04-24T18:01:32 <Justin_o> thanks for writing that up by the way

2014-04-24T18:12:57 <anastasiac> hi Bosmon, I have a question about the new model handling and modelListeners. I understand that anything registered with modelListeners: will be notified of the outcome of the initial transaction. Is there any assurance that this will happen after the component is pretty much set up? after it is rendered, etc?
2014-04-24T18:14:18 <anastasiac> after subcomponents have been attached...
2014-04-24T18:14:59 <anastasiac> after invokers have been set up
2014-04-24T18:15:42 <Bosmon> anastasiac - there will decreasingly be an idea of "after being set up"
2014-04-24T18:16:02 <Bosmon> You will be informed of the initial transaction as part of the general ginger process which constructs the component
2014-04-24T18:16:20 <anastasiac> here\'s my scenario:
2014-04-24T18:16:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - out of interest, did this problem go away if you removed the surplus call to "refreshView"?
2014-04-24T18:17:03 <anastasiac> I\'m looking at the VP\'s simple toggle button. when the state changes, I want to update the styles, change the aria-pressed value, update the tooltip text
2014-04-24T18:17:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  it did
2014-04-24T18:17:23 <anastasiac> this process includes the use of an invoker
2014-04-24T18:17:47 <anastasiac> but when the initial modelChanged happens, for the initial transaction, my invoker isn\'t ready
2014-04-24T18:18:15 <anastasiac> to clarify: the invoker is being called by the model listener
2014-04-24T18:18:22 <Bosmon> anastasiac - yes
2014-04-24T18:19:10 <Bosmon> Currently this is something you will need to guard against yourself - in the future we will have i) The fix for FLUID-4890 which includes a standard test for whether a component is full initialised, and in the further ii) the new renderer which will make all of this irrelevant
2014-04-24T18:19:19 <Bosmon> full -> fully
2014-04-24T18:19:35 <Bosmon> and in the further -> and in the further future
2014-04-24T18:19:52 <anastasiac> ok, so it\'s a known issue, in effect. Do you have any recommendations for a good way to guard against this, in the meantime?
2014-04-24T18:20:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: FLUID-4698 is ready for your review again
2014-04-24T18:20:45 <anastasiac> other than adding the model listener manually on the afterCreate event, for example?
2014-04-24T18:20:45 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I recommend you put a check in your invoker for whether the DOM binder you are trying to operate exists yet
2014-04-24T18:21:00 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2014-04-24T18:21:09 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I assume it is the absence of that which means that "your invoker is not ready"
2014-04-24T18:21:46 <anastasiac> well, I\'m getting "that.invokerName is not a function" when I try to invoke it
2014-04-24T18:22:03 <Bosmon> anastasiac - this issue is actually treated on the page I just referred Justin_o to :)
2014-04-24T18:22:20 <Bosmon> Although perhaps it should really go into a "best practices" document rather than "tips for debugging"
2014-04-24T18:22:20 <anastasiac> the tips for debugging page?
2014-04-24T18:22:23 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-04-24T18:22:43 <anastasiac> ah, I\'ll have a look, thanks. That page was on my list of things to read :-)
2014-04-24T18:22:44 <Bosmon> The best practice for this is to pass in a reference to the invoker you want to call as an IoC reference - rather than finding it manually on the component
2014-04-24T18:22:56 <Bosmon> Using this scheme, the invoker is "always ready"
2014-04-24T18:23:12 <anastasiac> ah, I see, since the reference triggers the ginger creation process, right?
2014-04-24T18:23:15 <Bosmon> right
2014-04-24T18:23:57 <Bosmon> Now the invoker itself might then in turn also reference something which might not be ready, which should then in turn also be passed as a reference
2014-04-24T18:24:10 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-04-24T18:24:14 <anastasiac> right; turtles all the way down
2014-04-24T18:24:16 <Bosmon> But eventually this process "tops out" given that in the new framework, essentially everything is created by the ginger process
2014-04-24T18:24:36 <Bosmon> Except, of course, for things created by the renderer which needs to be wholesale replaced
2014-04-24T18:24:57 <Bosmon> But certainly all the standard things in the viewComponent, modelComponent and eventedComponent hierarchy participate in this scheme
2014-04-24T18:25:15 <Bosmon> So you are never generally faced with a case of something which "can\'t be ready in time" as you would often meet in the old framework
2014-04-24T18:43:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac, Bosmon: any thoughts on naming for http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5207
2014-04-24T18:44:24 <anastasiac> Justin_o, renaming msgBundle to msgResolver seems like an easy decision
2014-04-24T18:45:29 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, any thoughts on stringBundle?
2014-04-24T18:46:00 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the \'stringBundle\' might be called "stringLookup\'? would that be in keeping with its function?
2014-04-24T18:47:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the underlying function name is called stringLookup... we\'d probably have to name the grade something else
2014-04-24T18:47:50 <Justin_o> or rename the function
2014-04-24T18:48:02 <anastasiac> stringTool
2014-04-24T18:48:05 <anastasiac> stringLookerUpper
2014-04-24T18:48:10 <anastasiac> msgLookup
2014-04-24T18:48:30 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L18-L53
2014-04-24T18:48:41 <Justin_o> anastasiac: hmm.. msgLookup
2014-04-24T18:48:49 <anastasiac> yeah, i saw the code
2014-04-24T18:49:07 <anastasiac> msgLookup does indicate a relationship to msgResolver, which might be good
2014-04-24T18:49:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: what do you think about just msg
2014-04-24T18:50:07 <anastasiac> that\'s actually not bad
2014-04-24T18:50:11 <anastasiac> or maybe message?
2014-04-24T18:50:13 <Justin_o> we could call the grade msgLookup still
2014-04-24T18:50:17 <Justin_o> anastasiac:
2014-04-24T18:50:21 <Justin_o> any preference for that
2014-04-24T18:50:27 <Justin_o> msg vs message
2014-04-24T18:50:32 <Justin_o> i\'m fine either way i guess
2014-04-24T18:50:48 <anastasiac> I like msgLookup for the grade. What were you suggesting msg for?
2014-04-24T18:52:11 <Justin_o> anastasiac:  for it\'s use in IoC https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L694
2014-04-24T18:52:55 <anastasiac> Justin_o, can they not be the same, as they were before?
2014-04-24T18:53:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: you mean leave it as stringBundle?
2014-04-24T18:54:05 <anastasiac> no, change it to msgLookup
2014-04-24T18:54:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: we could, just thought of making it shorter
2014-04-24T18:54:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - your issue is indeed a rather terrifying race condition
2014-04-24T18:54:56 <anastasiac> I\'m fine with slightly longer, for clariy
2014-04-24T18:54:59 <anastasiac> clarity
2014-04-24T18:55:03 <Justin_o> anastasiac: :) okay
2014-04-24T18:55:15 <Bosmon> What has happened is that the framework is partway through notifying a collection of listeners from a block of markup which has been destroyed
2014-04-24T18:55:35 <Bosmon> Both the markup and the component associated with it have been destroyed - but the framework is not yet done calling listeners
2014-04-24T18:56:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. so it is related to FLUID-4890, or this is a similar but different bug?
2014-04-24T18:56:33 <Bosmon> Well, sort of peripherally related
2014-04-24T18:56:44 <Bosmon> In that FLUID-4890 would diagnose this problem but not prevent it
2014-04-24T18:57:09 <anastasiac> Bosmon, is there any way of specifying a priority for modelListeners?
2014-04-24T18:57:40 <Bosmon> anastasiac - not currently
2014-04-24T18:57:51 <anastasiac> oh
2014-04-24T18:59:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh i see.. FLUID-4890 will just cause errors to happen immediately
2014-04-24T18:59:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2014-04-24T18:59:29 <Bosmon> You will get a slightly more comprehensible error message slightly earlier
2014-04-24T18:59:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: doesn\'t that mean we will need to fix a bunch of things along with it?
2014-04-24T18:59:39 <Bosmon> But the listener will still error out
2014-04-24T18:59:46 * vjoanna has quit
2014-04-24T19:00:25 <Bosmon> I guess we can still put this in the broad category of "design errors caused by the lack of a proper renderer"
2014-04-24T19:00:31 <Bosmon> But we still need to do something about it
2014-04-24T19:00:36 <Bosmon> That is, something immediately
2014-04-24T19:00:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for 1.5?
2014-04-24T19:01:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2014-04-24T19:01:22 <Bosmon> If we\'re lucky, the failures that FLUID-4890 exposes in UIO will have exactly the same cause as this
2014-04-24T19:01:37 <Bosmon> And we can deal with them all with the same fix
2014-04-24T19:02:17 <Bosmon> I\'ll need to spend a little more time looking at the exact sequence by which the component destroys itself
2014-04-24T19:03:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks though.. glad you\'re looking into this

2014-04-24T14:41:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so can you explain how you are getting different results with linting from cindyli ?
2014-04-24T14:42:10 * clown_mtg is now known as clown
2014-04-24T14:43:20 <cindyli> Bosmon: i reinstalled node modules but still not getting linting error for missing spaces
2014-04-24T14:45:18 <cindyli> Bosmon: if you removed a space somewhere such as in "= function (\xe2\x80\xa6", would your jshint report an error or warning?
2014-04-24T14:47:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - it doesn\'t check that one for me, no
2014-04-24T14:47:16 <Bosmon> It does check, for example, trailing space
2014-04-24T14:48:04 <Bosmon> It also checks indentation
2014-04-24T14:48:11 <Bosmon> Which I think is sort of all I care about : P
2014-04-24T14:49:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: would be nice to catch the missing spaces
2014-04-24T14:49:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: indentation checks are working for me, not sure about trailing whitespace as my editor removes those anyways
2014-04-24T14:49:32 <Bosmon> cindyli - isn\'t going to happen, unfortunately - we are pretty much stuck with the version of jshint we have now
2014-04-24T14:50:35 <cindyli> ok

2014-04-24T14:51:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was talking with michelled about the infusion 1.5 release yesterday, can you look at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4890
2014-04-24T14:51:35 <Justin_o> we are aiming to release by May 8
2014-04-24T14:51:41 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o - I will
2014-04-24T14:51:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-04-24T14:52:58 <michelled> oh Bosmon, is there a good time to meet tomorrow? I\'d love the documentation group to have a meeting before Simon leaves for vacation
2014-04-24T14:53:34 <Bosmon> I\'ll be around all day
2014-04-24T14:54:20 <michelled> ok
2014-04-24T14:55:18 <cindyli> michelled: in your code review for the new metadata demo last Friday, you expressed concern on this script: https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/FLOE-launcher/demos/js/launcher.js, can you remind me what your concern was about?
2014-04-24T14:55:50 <michelled> cindyli: it seemed like it might be something that was more generally useful rather than just a demo support
2014-04-24T14:55:59 <michelled> but I didn\'t have enough time to look at it closely
2014-04-24T14:57:03 * sgithens has quit
2014-04-24T14:58:09 <cindyli> ok, michelled. shall we wait till the time comes for it to be more generally used?
2014-04-24T14:59:37 <michelled> sure, I guess the problem is that I\'m certain to forget that it exists. can you describe what it does again?
2014-04-24T15:03:53 * jhung joined the channel
2014-04-24T15:18:30 <cindyli> sorry, michelled, was talking with justin. what the launcher does is, 1. set proper data into the database based on the requests. the request could be creating a new or editing an existing. 2. redirect the page to the proper editor page
2014-04-24T15:23:15 <michelled> thanks cindyli
2014-04-24T15:23:24 <cindyli> np
2014-04-24T15:24:26 * michelled has quit
2014-04-24T15:27:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i have a base grade called panel... this grade has a subcomponent that needs it\'s model value in an invoker and listener.. so it is referenced like {panel}.model. Now the panel grade doesn\'t define a model property in it\'s configuration. This is specified in whatever actually uses the panel grade as a sub grade.. should this work?
2014-04-24T15:28:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess by "subcomponent" you mean "derived grade"?
2014-04-24T15:28:50 <Bosmon> Yes, this will be fine
2014-04-24T15:29:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no i mean actual subcomponent
2014-04-24T15:29:23 <Justin_o> so the grade has a subcomponent called indicator
2014-04-24T15:29:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s also fine
2014-04-24T15:29:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m getting an error
2014-04-24T15:29:48 <Justin_o> ASSERTION FAILED: Failed to resolve reference {panel}.model - could not match context with name panel from component { typeName: "fluid.metadata.indicator" gradeNames: ["fluid.metadata.indicator","fluid.commonViewComponent","fluid.standardComponent","fluid.commonModelComponent"] id: 726fymy9-528} Object { typeName="fluid.metadata.indicator",
2014-04-24T15:29:48 <Justin_o> id="726fymy9-528", options={...}, more...}
2014-04-24T15:30:10 <Bosmon> ok
2014-04-24T15:30:18 <Bosmon> Then the base grade must be missing somehow
2014-04-24T15:30:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any thoughts on why might be wrong
2014-04-24T15:30:23 <Bosmon> Can you put more configuration in a pastie?
2014-04-24T15:30:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. running to stand up.. i\'ll try to get you some more details after
2014-04-24T15:42:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the file containing the panel grade
2014-04-24T15:42:34 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ZlsYHUA7
2014-04-24T15:42:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the one that uses it
2014-04-24T15:42:53 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XI6m2VyU
2014-04-24T15:43:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so things work fine to start, but when re-rendering occurs that\'s when the error is triggered
2014-04-24T15:44:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this seems like a bug to me - do you think you could extract a skeleton from this setup into a test case?
2014-04-24T15:44:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure i\'ll what i can do
2014-04-24T15:44:54 <Justin_o> see
2014-04-24T15:44:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers!
2014-04-24T15:49:48 * sgithens joined the channel
2014-04-24T15:51:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think i found the problem.. there was merge issue.. so we were calling refreshView twice for the same event..
2014-04-24T15:51:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you explain in more detail?
2014-04-24T15:51:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you can see that on line 64 and 133 or the second file i sent you
2014-04-24T15:52:14 <Justin_o> we had two model change listeners. one in the parent component and one in the subcomponent that would fire on the same model value change. I guess they are sharing a model.
2014-04-24T15:52:20 <Justin_o> both triggered the refreshView
2014-04-24T15:52:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s still peculiar this caused a failure
2014-04-24T15:53:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m working on solving a bunch of merge conflicts with master and my FLOE-116 branch... so the issue came because those two model listeners were set in different places and were both kept during the merge
2014-04-24T15:53:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah you expected it to work still?
2014-04-24T15:54:46 <Bosmon> Yes, I\'m not sure why it would cause a reference resolution failure, so it would be
2014-04-24T15:54:54 <Bosmon> nice to get to the bottom of the issue
2014-04-24T15:55:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll see if i can make a suitable test case

2014-04-24T15:59:33 <Bosmon> Clearly it should be possible to call refreshView any number of times from anywhere and not get a failure
2014-04-24T16:02:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: my guess is because it was calling it on the same component at the same time, that something hadn\'t fully resolved when it was trying to trigger it the second time
2014-04-24T16:02:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: i pushed up the merge changes to FLOE-116
2014-04-24T16:02:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - even so, that shouldn\'t be possible
2014-04-24T16:03:03 <cindyli> congrats, Justin_o, you did it!
2014-04-24T16:03:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: :)
2014-04-24T16:03:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll try to write something up for that
2014-04-24T16:04:19 <Bosmon> We need to make sure that the framework is completely free of incomprehensible and inexplicable behaviours, so it\'s important to try to track this down :)
2014-04-24T16:08:13 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-04-24T16:10:01 * kasparne_ has quit
2014-04-24T16:17:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) i can\'t argue with that
2014-04-24T16:58:54 * avtar joined the channel
2014-04-24T17:05:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i can\'t seem to create a failing test case
2014-04-24T17:11:26 <sgithens> We must be completely full of comprehensible and explicable behavior.
2014-04-24T17:12:49 <Justin_o> haha.. but i find it somewhat inexplicable that i can\'t create the failing case i was hoping to
2014-04-24T17:21:24 <Bosmon> well ok
2014-04-24T17:21:34 <Bosmon> Can you just check in the failing version then and I will investigate it
2014-04-24T17:21:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o ^
2014-04-24T17:21:55 <Bosmon> We must be free of inexplicable behaviour at all costs :)
2014-04-24T17:23:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure.. i\'ll make a new branch with that issue back in
