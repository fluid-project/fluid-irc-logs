b'2014-05-01T19:52:33 <Bosmon> And then apply it to the component in question
2014-05-01T19:52:50 <anastasiac> gotcha
2014-05-01T19:52:54 <anastasiac> that makes sense
2014-05-01T19:52:56 <anastasiac> so should our documentation be updated to say "don\'t use modelChanged.addListener" rather than just "it\'s not recommended" ?
2014-05-01T19:53:05 <Bosmon> Yes, ok
2014-05-01T19:53:14 <Bosmon> Let\'s make it say that :)
2014-05-01T19:53:18 <anastasiac> :-)
2014-05-01T19:53:20 <Bosmon> Although we could fix up the system so it is better than it is
2014-05-01T19:53:41 <Bosmon> At the moment the default effect is to bind one of the old-fashioned "nontransactional listeners" by default
2014-05-01T19:53:48 <Bosmon> Which in the new system is completely useless
2014-05-01T19:53:57 <anastasiac> perhaps for now, we should just remove mention of modelChanged.addListener from the docs altogether
2014-05-01T19:54:08 <anastasiac> rather than "it\'s there, but don\'t use it"
2014-05-01T19:54:14 <Bosmon> You can still have the effect you want by binding a transactional listener by supplying {transactional: true} as the 1st argument to addListener
2014-05-01T19:54:44 <Bosmon> But it\'s a question whether it is worth fixing up at all, and whether we should just insist everyone binds listeners declaratively
2014-05-01T19:55:03 <anastasiac> my vote is for the declarative route
2014-05-01T19:55:49 <Bosmon> The old "transactional system" was strange and unusual and not used by anyone (except the pager)... whereas in the new implementation it is crucial to the whole system and everyone participates in it by default
2014-05-01T19:55:59 <Bosmon> Since "new-style model relay" can\'t work without transactions
2014-05-01T19:57:15 * yzen joined the channel
2014-05-01T19:58:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for pulls 506 and 507
2014-05-01T19:59:02 <Bosmon> 506 looks completely terrifying
2014-05-01T20:00:10 <Bosmon> Given that it seems that this sorting does nothing on any platform currently, we would want a better way of checking for its effects rather than expecting someone to run our tests on IE8 ........
2014-05-01T20:00:25 <Bosmon> Given as soon as we release, we\'ll stop running these tests on IE8 at all

2014-05-01T13:26:36 <jhung> I haven\'t gotten around to creating a formal wiki page for the css framework recommendation yet Justin_o. Today hopefully (I said that yesterday too!)
2014-05-01T13:26:40 <colinclark> Justin_o: Won\xe2\x80\x99t it be SO GREAT when we can just remove the non-HTML5 versions of the Uploader? :)

2014-05-01T13:27:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: it will be :)
2014-05-01T13:27:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: any idea how to fix the uploader issue for the 1.5 release?
2014-05-01T13:27:35 <colinclark> where\xe2\x80\x99s the issue documented?
2014-05-01T13:28:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5353
2014-05-01T13:28:31 <colinclark> urg
2014-05-01T13:29:12 <colinclark> Justin_o: I just made the mistake of going to the SWFUpload site
2014-05-01T13:29:29 <colinclark> I wonder if we should remove old-IE support in 1.5
2014-05-01T13:29:30 <colinclark> https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/
2014-05-01T13:30:16 <Justin_o> i suppose we could use this "SWFUpload\'s .swf file suffers from a Cross Scripting vulnerability as described here: https://nealpoole.com/blog/2012/05/xss-and-csrf-via-swf-applets-swfupload-plupload/" as the reason
2014-05-01T13:30:27 <colinclark> yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly it
2014-05-01T13:30:37 <colinclark> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should be shipping code that enables XSS attacks
2014-05-01T13:30:56 <colinclark> It was always some of the worst code I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in my life
2014-05-01T13:30:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess we should replace it with an adequate error message that the browser isn\'t supported or something like that
2014-05-01T13:31:01 <colinclark> no joke
2014-05-01T13:31:07 <colinclark> yeah, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad idea
2014-05-01T13:31:10 <Justin_o> or the no-javascript fallback might be fine
2014-05-01T13:31:41 <colinclark> yes, the no-JavaScript fallback seems fine
2014-05-01T13:31:53 <colinclark> Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s too extreme?
2014-05-01T13:31:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: any chance you\'ll be able to do this?

2014-05-01T13:43:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: i don\'t think they are in IE 9
2014-05-01T13:43:09 <colinclark> ok
2014-05-01T13:46:30 <colinclark> Justin_o: I just sent an email to the list about it, too
2014-05-01T13:48:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: from a quick test IE 10 and 11 seem to be working
2014-05-01T13:48:10 <Justin_o> and thanks for sending the e-mail
2014-05-01T13:48:19 <colinclark> great

2014-05-01T13:52:50 <colinclark> that\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable compromise

2014-05-01T19:13:34 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-05-01T19:13:45 <anastasiac> I have a modelChanged listener being called with the correct \'new\' and \'old\' values, but if the listener inspects the actual model, it doesn\'t yet contain the new value

2014-05-01T19:36:01 <Bosmon> anastasiac - it\'s not possible
2014-05-01T19:36:22 <Bosmon> Unless you are holding on to a cached reference to the value "model" for the component, which is not supported with the new ChangeApplier
2014-05-01T19:36:27 <anastasiac> Bosmon, could you have a look at my code, and see if perhaps you can figure out what\'s going wrong?

2014-05-01T19:39:08 <Bosmon> Where is it?
2014-05-01T19:39:44 <anastasiac> Bosmon: https://github.com/acheetham/videoPlayer/blob/VP-297/js/VideoPlayer_showHide.js#L59
2014-05-01T19:39:58 <anastasiac> it\'s the model on the that, Bosmon
2014-05-01T19:43:13 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ll have to try it out
2014-05-01T19:43:20 <Bosmon> Is this in your branch called https://github.com/acheetham/videoPlayer/tree/VP-297 ?
2014-05-01T19:43:47 <anastasiac> Bosmon, thanks, I appreciate any help. I\'m probably just doing something stupid, but for the life of me I can\'t see what
2014-05-01T19:44:08 <anastasiac> yes, that\'s the branch, Bosmon
2014-05-01T19:44:09 <Bosmon> or one of the others

2014-05-01T19:44:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: after you finish helping anastasiac could you please review a couple of pull request for me. They should finish fixing up the IE8 unit tests. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/506 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/507
2014-05-01T19:45:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - certainly
2014-05-01T19:45:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-05-01T19:50:07 <Bosmon> Hi anastasiac
2014-05-01T19:50:14 <anastasiac> hi, Bosmon
2014-05-01T19:50:25 <Bosmon> So the issue is that when I made the new modelRelay implementation, I didn\'t dream that anyone would continue to bind listeners declaratively : P
2014-05-01T19:50:35 <Bosmon> As it explains in our new documentation, it is not recommended
2014-05-01T19:50:38 <anastasiac> :-)
2014-05-01T19:51:01 <anastasiac> well, the model path is constructed based on integrator-provided strings. Any recommendations on how to do this?
2014-05-01T19:51:18 <anastasiac> as you said yesterday, and expander won\'t work for modelListener block
2014-05-01T19:51:25 <Bosmon> And when I said yesterday that "you shouldn\'t produce a declarative system for processing your configuration" I didn\'t mean that you shouldn\'t bind the listeners declaratively
2014-05-01T19:51:39 <Bosmon> I meant that you should generate the declarative configuration to bind them, in a procedural way
2014-05-01T19:51:48 <Bosmon> And I pointed you towards our auxBuilder etc as an example of how to do this
2014-05-01T19:51:57 <anastasiac> right
2014-05-01T19:52:26 <Bosmon> So what you should have is a function which generated a dynamic grade which holds the configuration you want
'
