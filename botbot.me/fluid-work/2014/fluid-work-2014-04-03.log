2014-04-03T22:35:47 <Bosmon7> Hi KASPARRENT
2014-04-03T22:36:00 <Bosmon7> I'm sorry I haven't had time to look at your looping bug so far
2014-04-03T22:36:41 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: no worries - I just wanted to check before heading to bed that whether my email made sense, etc
2014-04-03T22:37:18 <kasparnet> it's probably for the best -- then I'll get around to do all the tasks for which i'm using the programming as a procrastinating
2014-04-03T22:37:20 <kasparnet> :)
2014-04-03T22:37:54 <Bosmon7> Horrifying when we consider doing practical work as a form of procrastinating : P

b'2014-04-03T11:28:13 <kasparnet> I think pretty much everything is broke right now
2014-04-03T11:28:42 <kasparnet> but you can reproduce the error by running this: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/ontologytmp/gpii/node_modules/ontologyHandler/test/node/OntologyServerTests.js

2014-04-03T11:37:37 <Bosmon7> I guess the one called PreferencesFramework
2014-04-03T11:38:54 <Bosmon7> I see the version you have checked in still has the urlExpanderGradeNames junk
2014-04-03T11:39:07 <Bosmon7> I\'ve got to get off unforuntunately but I\'ll be back in about 6 hours or so
2014-04-03T11:39:17 <Bosmon7> Shoot me a mail with how far you have got
2014-04-03T11:43:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: ok sorry for not being very responsive - getting some food before my meetings 14.00 and onwars

2014-04-03T13:46:25 <amilchev> hi, Juston_o, wondering what happened when you tested PMT/PCP with latest updates?
2014-04-03T13:57:52 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello, sorry i\'m in long meeting today, so not sure how available i\'ll be to chat. I don\'t think the contrast was working though. anastasiac was trying to rebuild GPII on our test machine too.
2014-04-03T13:58:02 <Justin_o> anastasiac: did you get the contrast working at all on the windows 7 machine?
2014-04-03T13:58:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o, amilchev, no, I didn\'t I think it\'s probably a login problem. It seems that the system never mananges to actually load the saved preferences in, so of course they\'re not applied
2014-04-03T13:59:04 <anastasiac> I\'m setting up a fedora box now to try it there
2014-04-03T13:59:21 <Justin_o> amilchev: did you have any problems with login?
2014-04-03T14:01:14 <amilchev> Justin_o: I didn\'t seem to have any, settings were applied so the login must\'ve been fine
2014-04-03T14:01:32 <Justin_o> amilchev: to the OS?
2014-04-03T14:01:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: are you using pilots2 branch and for PMT/PCP are you using dev mode or not?
2014-04-03T14:02:11 <amilchev> Justin_o: yes, to the OS, the  high contrast and cursor size for sure
2014-04-03T14:03:02 <amilchev> Justin_o: pilots2 branch of universal
2014-04-03T14:03:31 <clown> jhernandez:  coming to the gnome-a11y meeting?  (just started).
2014-04-03T14:03:43 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2014-04-03T14:03:58 <amilchev> Justin_o: for running PCP/PMT I just follow the instructions in the wiki
2014-04-03T14:04:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: could you send me the link for that again?
2014-04-03T14:05:21 <jhernandez> clown_mtg: yeah

2014-04-03T14:06:19 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay thanks
2014-04-03T14:06:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think you ran that the same way as amilchev. Which makes me confused as to why we were seeing different behaviour.. we might need to start over on installing GPII on that machine
2014-04-03T14:07:20 <anastasiac> Justin_o, yesterday I did a complete re-install of gpii on that windows machine
2014-04-03T14:07:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: oh :(
2014-04-03T14:07:35 <anastasiac> the only thing I resurrected from before was your little webserver, since I didn\'t know where that came from
2014-04-03T14:08:09 <amilchev> weird.......
2014-04-03T14:08:15 <Justin_o> yes.. hmm.. could it have something to do with the web server?
2014-04-03T14:08:24 <Justin_o> anastasiac, amilchev: ^
2014-04-03T14:08:57 <anastasiac> well, possibly, Justin_o, but you\'d have to answer that :-)
2014-04-03T14:09:18 <amilchev> Justin_o: I don\'t know, possibly
2014-04-03T14:09:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it worked before.. maybe something has changed.. we might need to try to switch it

If I make a change using the PMT and save: 1) the changes are not applied, and 2)  when I switch to the PCP, those changes are not there.

2014-04-03T20:02:27 <Bosmon7> thanks, Justin_o
2014-04-03T20:02:43 <Justin_o> i can research some more if you there is something else you need to know
2014-04-03T20:03:11 <Bosmon7> Does this failure correspond to the failure of any test cases?
2014-04-03T20:03:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: you mean generally?
2014-04-03T20:04:05 <Justin_o> across other browsers?

2014-04-03T20:07:39 <Bosmon8> And if you could look to see what value is held in "options" passed as an argument to this function during the failure, it would be very helpful

2014-04-03T20:37:10 <cindyli> hi Bosmon7, i created a customized conditional transform in metadata demo to hook up its invertConfiguration. The inversion seems happening correctly with unit tests passing. However, the inversion doesn\'t happen when the transform is used in the model relay, the same issue as FLUID-5293 that you have a pull request for. the infusion version I use for the metadata demo has that pull request in. Is there anything special I need to do to hook
2014-04-03T20:37:45 <cindyli> Bosmon7: the customized conditional transform - https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/FLOE-171/src/js/transforms.js
2014-04-03T20:38:12 <Bosmon7> cindyli - nothing special other than correctly register the inversion rule
2014-04-03T20:38:19 <Bosmon7> The framework should pick it up automatically
2014-04-03T20:39:51 <cindyli> Bosmon7: does this look ok to you - https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/FLOE-171/src/js/transforms.js#L25-L30
2014-04-03T20:42:51 <Bosmon7> cindyli - seems reasonable - if the framework successfully processes the inversion, then it is ok
2014-04-03T20:44:21 <cindyli> the inversion didn\'t happen. good to know the customization looks ok. will keep digging. thanks, Bosmon7
2014-04-03T20:45:24 * cindyli has quit
2014-04-03T20:45:31 <Bosmon7> cindyli - it didn\'t happen in a standalone test case, or it didn\'t happen using relay?

2014-04-03T08:48:38 <kasparnet> morning Bosmon7
2014-04-03T08:48:55 <Bosmon7> DAMNNN YYYOUU, KASSPPPAAARNEEEETTT!
2014-04-03T08:51:14 <Bosmon7> kasparnet ^ : P
2014-04-03T08:51:25 <kasparnet> hehe, nothing like a morning damning
2014-04-03T08:51:44 <Bosmon7> "Nothing like the smell of a damning in the morning" : P
2014-04-03T08:52:00 <kasparnet> :D]
2014-04-03T08:52:25 <kasparnet> so I might have just figured out what I was having problems - which was a problem getting a test to listen for an event
2014-04-03T08:52:45 <kasparnet> but I guess before moving on with that, it would be good to check if it\'s totally crazy
2014-04-03T08:53:13 <kasparnet> so I spent a bit of time considering the ontology API thing I mentioned yesterday
2014-04-03T08:53:22 <kasparnet> and there are two things
2014-04-03T08:54:21 <kasparnet> first of all - the pure ontology call (ie. I\'m passing a preference set along with parameters telling in what ontology it\'s in, and the desired ontology)
2014-04-03T08:54:42 <kasparnet> I dont see how that would fit into REST
2014-04-03T08:55:07 <kasparnet> as the preference set is likely too big to be passed as a URL parameter
2014-04-03T08:55:27 <kasparnet> and the contract with PUT and POST is that we are modifying resources on the server, which we\'re not
2014-04-03T08:55:47 <Bosmon7> Well, the contract is weaker than that
2014-04-03T08:55:58 <Bosmon7> In practice POST can be used for "any generalised non-idempotent operation"
2014-04-03T08:56:17 <Bosmon7> And in fact this is how it ended up being abused a lot to implement the so-called "web services" ....
2014-04-03T08:56:33 <kasparnet> ok, so it\'d be a post then
2014-04-03T08:56:35 <kasparnet> thanks
2014-04-03T08:56:54 <kasparnet> so the next thing
2014-04-03T08:57:18 <Bosmon7> But I\'m wondering, who might be making such a "pure ontology call" as a web service?
2014-04-03T08:57:41 <kasparnet> yeah - I was too... I mean, it seems sensible to have the ontologies centralized somewhere
2014-04-03T08:57:41 <Bosmon7> Isn\'t this only something done by the flow manager itself as the tail end of the matchmaking process?
2014-04-03T08:58:25 <kasparnet> yeah
2014-04-03T08:58:51 <kasparnet> at least I cant think of any other use cases than those where it\'d come from the flowmanager
2014-04-03T08:58:58 <Bosmon7> There\'s no need to expose absolutely everything as a web service willy-nilly, as we did in the zene\'evich days
2014-04-03T08:59:08 <Bosmon7> Often in fact it makes quite a mess
2014-04-03T09:00:14 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: yeah - I was considering that in terms of load/speed as well.. but I dont think I\'d fully thought through that it might not be needed at all - just that it could be avoided in the general preferences calls
2014-04-03T09:00:26 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: So I guess this brings me to the second question
2014-04-03T09:00:30 <Bosmon7> cool
2014-04-03T09:01:12 <kasparnet> which is: It seems to me that the work I\'m doing is actually on a new component, which is something along the lines of a "preferences Framework"
2014-04-03T09:01:37 <Bosmon7> !
2014-04-03T09:02:01 <kasparnet> which is a sort of front-end for the "raw preferences server", "ontology handler", and perhaps in the future a "context resolver" and "security gateway" would be included in those as well
2014-04-03T09:03:13 <Bosmon7> I think by convention with our other components, this might be called a "preferences manager"
2014-04-03T09:03:23 <kasparnet> yes, that\'s a better name
2014-04-03T09:03:29 <Bosmon7> cf the "Lifecycle Manager" etc.
2014-04-03T09:04:06 <kasparnet> does it then seem ok to create a new component called preferences manager, which will expose all the "/preferences/*" APIs
2014-04-03T09:04:22 <kasparnet> and change the ontology one to being a non-REST component
2014-04-03T09:04:27 <Bosmon7> Well, I think that that thing would still be the "server"
2014-04-03T09:04:35 <kasparnet> the ontology would?
2014-04-03T09:04:38 <Bosmon7> I think you would create the new component for the thing that does the coordination
2014-04-03T09:04:46 <Bosmon7> That is, the "preferences manager" is the new component
2014-04-03T09:05:16 <Bosmon7> And all the endpoints stlil belong in the thing called "preference server" or even "preference manager server"
2014-04-03T09:05:32 <Bosmon7> For example look at the lifecycleManager component
2014-04-03T09:05:59 <Bosmon7> That has all of the impl in LifecycleManager.js
2014-04-03T09:06:07 <Bosmon7> And all of the server definitions are in LifecycleManagerServer.js etc.
2014-04-03T09:08:05 <kasparnet> I\'m getting slightly confused.. So we have three "things": ontologyThing, preferences manager and raw preferences datasource
2014-04-03T09:08:26 <kasparnet> where \'preferences manager\' is currently non-existing
2014-04-03T09:08:39 <Bosmon7> Yes well, I imagine we actually have four things
2014-04-03T09:08:45 <Bosmon7> The fourth one being the "real preferences server"
2014-04-03T09:08:50 <Bosmon7> The one actually contacted from the outside
2014-04-03T09:09:31 <Bosmon7> I guess we sort of have that one already
2014-04-03T09:10:39 <kasparnet> so would this "real preferences server" act as a public external API for preferences manager (which in turn talks with the raw preferences and ontologies)?
2014-04-03T09:11:02 <Bosmon7> yes
2014-04-03T09:16:24 <kasparnet> ok.. I\'ll give it a shot.. thanks a lot antranig
2014-04-03T09:18:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Random question, I am considering buying either parallels or vmware fusion so that I can easily run nvda etc. from my boot camp partition.  Does anyone have an opinion about one versus the other?
2014-04-03T09:45:39 * kasparnet has quit
2014-04-03T09:49:32 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-04-03T09:53:25 <the-t-in-rtf> To answer my own question I ended up using a 30 day trial of Fusion 6.
2014-04-03T10:16:59 <kasparnet> the-t-in-rtf: sorry for the non-responsiveness.. haven\'t tried vmware a lot, but I had quite good experiences with parallels - seemed to run everything very well.. I\'m currently using virtualbox, which isn\'t working that well (graphics driver dont register properly, etc) for me - but it\'s free, open source and is likely what we\'ll be using for our vm provisioning when we at some point get to that
2014-04-03T10:17:22 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: ping
2014-04-03T10:17:33 <Bosmon7> DAMMMNN, etc.!
2014-04-03T10:17:39 <kasparnet> hehe
2014-04-03T10:19:06 <kasparnet> so I\'m trying to use the type: "kettle.dataSource.URL" from my ontology thing, since it\'ll be useful for get\'ting the ontology transformations
2014-04-03T10:19:33 <kasparnet> but I\'m having some problems, since I un-kettle app\'d the ontology code
2014-04-03T10:19:35 <kasparnet> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Failed to resolve reference {kettle.server}.options.port - could not match context with name kettle.server from component { typeName: "kettle.urlExpander" gradeNames: ["kettle.urlExpander.development","kettle.urlExpander"] id: asow5fv6-31}
2014-04-03T10:19:49 <Bosmon7> Yes well
2014-04-03T10:20:01 <Bosmon7> This part of our design is real rubbish and hasn\'t been revisited in a while
2014-04-03T10:20:53 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: if I\'m afraid I\'ll drown if I open more cans of worms, is there a simple workaround for this stuff you can think of?
2014-04-03T10:21:20 <Bosmon7> Well, on the face of it I don\'t see that it\'s built in with a dependency on kettle.server
2014-04-03T10:21:28 <Bosmon7> So you must have put it there with the configuration you wrote
2014-04-03T10:21:30 <Bosmon7> Can you pastie?
2014-04-03T10:22:55 <Bosmon7> Oh dear
2014-04-03T10:23:01 <Bosmon7> It looks like it is actually built in
2014-04-03T10:24:47 <Bosmon7> kasparnet ^
2014-04-03T10:25:00 <Bosmon7> Did you fall asleep in your suopp? : P
2014-04-03T10:25:23 <kasparnet> I was just looking through my code.. you still want the pastie?
2014-04-03T10:25:50 <Bosmon7> certainly
2014-04-03T10:26:14 <Bosmon7> It looks like all we need to do is get rid of the poorly-named grade kettle.urlExpander.development ......
2014-04-03T10:27:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: http://pastie.org/8990909
2014-04-03T10:27:47 <kasparnet> (sorry for all the crap in there, I\'m in the middle of moving things around between here and preferences manager)
2014-04-03T10:28:25 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - yes, just get rid of the last 5 lines of junk from your defaults and it should start working
2014-04-03T10:28:35 <Bosmon7> It seems you were suspicious of them anyway
2014-04-03T10:29:41 <Bosmon7> YOu should just use fluid.contains rather than those cumbersome calls to $.inArray
2014-04-03T10:30:18 <kasparnet> cool, will do - part of this was written on the plane, so had to default to functions I knew :)
2014-04-03T10:30:33 <Bosmon7> Soon we will have ..... OFF-LINE DOCCUKUMENTATION!!!
2014-04-03T10:30:42 <Bosmon7> I want to make a start on it next week
2014-04-03T10:30:43 <kasparnet> oooooh
2014-04-03T10:30:46 <kasparnet> nice!!!
2014-04-03T10:30:54 <Bosmon7> I think bates is also producing some
2014-04-03T10:30:57 <kasparnet> that\'s gonna be awesome to have
2014-04-03T10:31:23 <kasparnet> so, I got rid of distributeOptions and urlExpanderGradeNames, and now the system just freezes instead :S
2014-04-03T10:31:30 <Bosmon7> Well that\'s better
2014-04-03T10:31:39 <Bosmon7> It means it is probably trying to actually use your dataSource :)
2014-04-03T10:31:59 <kasparnet> yeah, that\'s a good point
2014-04-03T10:32:07 <kasparnet> I felt it as more of a regression
2014-04-03T10:32:20 <kasparnet> ok - will do a bit of debugging and then come crying in 20 minutes or so
2014-04-03T10:32:24 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-04-03T10:32:27 <kasparnet> thanks Bosmon7
2014-04-03T10:32:33 <Bosmon7> I\'ll be here for a bit
2014-04-03T10:32:42 <Bosmon7> I imagine I\'ll need to get off in about an hour
2014-04-03T10:35:03 <kasparnet> ok - else I got plenty of things to work on until I catch you tomorrow or something :)
2014-04-03T10:46:55 <kasparnet> hmmm.. seems to be stuck in an infinite call loop to this function: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/454887d8d2b8c86c7761f10003c9dcdbb77a5061/lib/dataSource.js#L471
2014-04-03T10:47:51 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: ^
2014-04-03T10:49:41 <kasparnet> this is the "that" object passed to the function http://pastie.org/8990966
2014-04-03T10:58:26 <Bosmon7> Hi kasparnet
2014-04-03T11:03:05 <Bosmon7> It\'s unclear what your callbackWrapper is
2014-04-03T11:03:16 <Bosmon7> What is it doing there?
2014-04-03T11:03:49 <Bosmon7> I\'m somewhat amazed how you got this pastie though
2014-04-03T11:03:51 <Bosmon7> How did you generate it?
2014-04-03T11:04:12 <Bosmon7> It appears to be a strange mixture of expanded and unexpanded material
2014-04-03T11:09:23 * amilchev joined the channel
2014-04-03T11:10:04 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: it was just a json.stringify of the that object
2014-04-03T11:10:28 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: I\'m not sure what that damn callback wrapper is as well
2014-04-03T11:10:38 <kasparnet> it\'s part of the kettle framework
2014-04-03T11:10:48 <Bosmon7> Yes, I know
2014-04-03T11:11:05 <Bosmon7> Well, I imagine you don\'t have a valid one
2014-04-03T11:11:09 <Bosmon7> Which is probably part of your problem
2014-04-03T11:14:27 <Bosmon7> I\'m not even sure what the effects of writing this are:       "callbackWrapper": "{callbackWrapper}", - the framework should really signal an error at this point
2014-04-03T11:15:44 <Bosmon7> Urgh
2014-04-03T11:15:51 <Bosmon7> I see that our favorite Belarussian wrote it
2014-04-03T11:16:04 <Bosmon7> Inside kettle.dataSource.simpleCallbackWrapper ......
2014-04-03T11:16:39 <Bosmon7> Could you check in all of your code to a branch?
2014-04-03T11:28:04 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: sure - https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/ontologytmp
