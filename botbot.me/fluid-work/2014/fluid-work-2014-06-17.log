2014-06-17T17:24:39 <cindyli> shall we address that, has been pushed up tho. sigh\xe2\x80\xa6 sorry
2014-06-17T17:25:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: yah.. i don\'t know if you can fix that once it\'s been pushed to master :(
2014-06-17T17:26:01 <Justin_o> cindyli:  at least the merge commit has the right jira number in the log
2014-06-17T17:26:18 <cindyli> ok, a little better
2014-06-17T17:26:26 <Justin_o> cindyli: you could back out the merge and redo it, but it will still be in the commit history
2014-06-17T17:26:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m thinking it\'s probably unfortunate, but okay.. what do you think?
2014-06-17T17:27:00 <cindyli> i\'m thinking to leave it this way too

2014-06-17T17:48:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great, currently it\'s slated for doc work, but i\'m thinking of taking up some time to talk about the demo reorganization first.

2014-06-17T20:02:12 <cindyli> simonjb: in a markdown doc, do you know how to have a code snippet inside a table? like the second table in this doc: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Tutorial+-+Creating+a+New+Adjuster+UI
2014-06-17T20:04:41 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'ve converted a couple of pages with code in tables and the only way I can think to do it is to use HTML -- here\'s an example: https://github.com/simonbates/infusion-docs/blob/FLUID-5439/LocalizationInThePreferencesFramework.md#in-the-prototrees
2014-06-17T20:05:53 <simonjb> cindyli: using <pre><code>...</code></pre>
2014-06-17T20:06:03 <cindyli> cool. thanks, simonjb
2014-06-17T20:06:49 <simonjb> cindyli: but it does mean that you need to esacpe and HTML-special chars yourself: &, <
2014-06-17T20:07:07 <cindyli> ah. i see.
2014-06-17T20:07:08 <simonjb> & = &amp;
2014-06-17T20:07:15 <simonjb> < = &lt;
2014-06-17T20:07:57 <simonjb> if you find a better way, please let me know
2014-06-17T20:08:58 <cindyli> sure. have tried a couple ways but no success. :(

2014-06-17T20:10:13 <simonjb> cindyli: I would also wonder for the big table on your page under "Cusom Styling" if maybe linearizing it might not be a good idea to save you doing it by hand -- that table with be particularly bothersome as it contains lots of HTML which you will need to escape
2014-06-17T20:10:51 <simonjb> cindyli: if we get rid of the table, we can just use markdown to convert it for us -- much easier!
2014-06-17T20:13:09 <cindyli> agree, simonjb.
2014-06-17T20:14:13 <simonjb> cindyli: actually all the tables on that page contain HTML which would need to be escaped -- I wonder if we can just linearize them all -- maybe start with that and see how it looks? it will save a lot of hassle (both right now and in maintenance) and if still readable, would be better
2014-06-17T20:15:08 <cindyli> good idea. will do
2014-06-17T20:15:18 * clown joined the channel
2014-06-17T20:15:19 <simonjb> cindyli: the other option would be to try using CDATA sections
2014-06-17T20:15:51 <cindyli> what\'s that?
2014-06-17T20:16:05 <simonjb> cindyli: we\'d need to test that pretty carefully though to see how the markdown processor handles it and to see what modern browsers do with it
2014-06-17T20:17:20 <cindyli> ha, sounds like using straight markup is more reliable and straight forward
2014-06-17T20:18:49 <simonjb> cindyli: it\'s a feature from SGML/XML which let\'s you instruct the parser to ignore special chars until the end of the section http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA

2014-06-17T20:31:18 <simonjb> cindyli: yeah, so let\'s not try that route -- let\'s try linearizing first and using markdown code blocks and see how it looks

2014-06-17T14:23:01 <Bosmon> Looks like you are arriving on Saturday, slee_ ?
2014-06-17T14:23:16 <Bosmon> Sorry, Sunday
2014-06-17T14:24:50 <slee_> Bosmon: Sat is correct - did I forget to update somehting? Last minute change as only sensible flight
2014-06-17T14:25:37 <Bosmon> Ok, I had you down in my list as 22-27th
2014-06-17T14:26:09 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t change anything since our reservations are from 21st
2014-06-17T14:26:53 <slee_> Phew
2014-06-17T14:26:58 <slee_> so how do I get there?
2014-06-17T14:29:16 <Bosmon> We may be able to pick you up in hire car... I think kasparnet gets the honour of renting the first one!
2014-06-17T14:29:23 <Bosmon> Otherwise taxi might be best, there are no buses to speak of
2014-06-17T14:37:48 <slee_> Bosmon: OK, What is that address? phone no?
2014-06-17T14:37:55 * anvk joined the channel
2014-06-17T14:39:41 <Bosmon> slee_ - I pasted the address just then
2014-06-17T14:39:53 <Bosmon> We should have a round of swapping phone numbers by email
2014-06-17T14:40:33 <slee_> I can\'t see address - you mean pasted in IRC?
2014-06-17T14:40:52 <slee_> Bosmon: oh. my bad I see it above
2014-06-17T14:40:58 <slee_> Thanks!
2014-06-17T14:41:35 <slee_> +1 to phone number swaping
2014-06-17T14:42:38 <clown> Justin_o:  do you have a moment?
2014-06-17T14:42:48 <Justin_o> clown: sure
2014-06-17T14:43:11 <clown> come on over, I can show you something about your progress bar.

2014-06-17T15:07:21 <cindyli> clown: the jira for the progress bar - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5423
2014-06-17T15:07:23 <cindyli> thanks
2014-06-17T15:17:26 <clown> cindyli:  thanks
2014-06-17T15:17:35 <cindyli> np
2014-06-17T15:19:39 <slee_> Bosmon: PS I\'m leaving on 28th now - Is that OK?
2014-06-17T15:23:11 * michelled joined the channel
2014-06-17T15:23:34 <Bosmon> slee_ - that is ok too
2014-06-17T15:23:57 <Bosmon> You and Jess were previously the only people with anomalous dates which wasn\'t enough to tip our reservations
2014-06-17T15:24:43 <clown> Justin_o:  confirming a suspicion.  Go to the change table, and look up aria-valuenow and aria-valuetext:  http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-core-aam-1.1-20140612/#mapping_events_state-change
2014-06-17T15:27:26 <Justin_o> clown: ah.. so the valuetext is ignored for MSAA and UIA
2014-06-17T15:27:45 <clown> Justin_o:  Yup.
2014-06-17T15:28:26 <clown> wait a second...
2014-06-17T15:29:00 <clown> okay, right.
2014-06-17T15:30:34 <Justin_o> clown: so in those cases it would always use the value now? which i guess is why IE giving the tones with NVDA.
2014-06-17T15:31:02 <clown> "it"?
2014-06-17T15:31:38 <Justin_o> no specifically IE and NVDA, are reporting with the tones for progress..
2014-06-17T15:32:45 <clown> My reading from that table is that if aria-valuetext changes, no events are fired for MSAA+UIA Express nor a pure UIA platform.
2014-06-17T15:33:48 <clown> But, for aria-valuenow changes, all platforms fire some event.
2014-06-17T15:34:51 <clown> Specifically, for MSAA+UIA Express:  EVENT_OBJECT_VALUECHANGED.  For UIA: ValueProperty property change.
