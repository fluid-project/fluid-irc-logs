2014-02-06T19:10:22 <anastasiac> jhung, what do you think about pushing what you\'ve got so far for your foundation work? It would be interesting to have a look at it and compare it to my branch (FLUID-5251)
2014-02-06T19:10:46 <jhung> anastasiac: sure. Give me a sec.
2014-02-06T19:13:55 <jhung> anastasiac: https://github.com/jhung/fluidproject.org/tree/FLUID-5262
2014-02-06T19:14:13 <jhung> I\'ll grab your branch now
2014-02-06T19:16:14 <anastasiac> wow. Yours is much nicer than mine, jhung :-)
2014-02-06T19:17:54 <Justin_o_> anastasiac, jhung: did we say we are meeting this afternoon, or monday?
2014-02-06T19:18:31 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o_ we never decided. I\'m fine either way.
2014-02-06T19:18:56 <anastasiac> I\'m fine either way, jhung, Justin_o_
2014-02-06T19:19:41 <Justin_o_> jhung, anastasiac: maybe we can meet up this afternoon and again on monday if needed.. i\'m free anytime between now and 3:30 today.. are you both available in that range?
2014-02-06T19:19:53 <anastasiac> yep
2014-02-06T19:20:06 <anastasiac> yes, it would be good to identify if we have questions we still want answered
2014-02-06T19:20:42 <jhung> sounds good Justin_o_ anastasiac. How about in 10 minutes / 2:30p?

2014-02-06T21:37:01 <Bosmon> Hi anastasiac
2014-02-06T21:37:26 <anastasiac> Hi, Bosmon. I have a question about progressive enhancement
2014-02-06T21:37:35 <Bosmon> anastasiac - cool
2014-02-06T21:37:54 <anastasiac> Bosmon, the VideoPlayer has two independent things it wants to check for. I\'ve put the two checks in the progressiveCheckerOptions.checks array, but in a browser that fails the first check, the second check never even happens!
2014-02-06T21:38:01 <anastasiac> how can I specify independent checks?
2014-02-06T21:38:16 <Bosmon> anastasiac - that\'s an interesting point that I had forgotten
2014-02-06T21:38:41 <Bosmon> We should probably respecify this behaviour as part of our rewrite of progressiveEnhancement
2014-02-06T21:40:45 <anastasiac> Bosmon, in the meantime, how can I specify independent checks?
2014-02-06T21:40:59 <Bosmon> anastasiac - in case you hadn\'t seen it, this work is described by http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5241
2014-02-06T21:41:25 <Bosmon> I suggest that what you should do is what we do in these time-honoured circumstances, which is to implement a piece of "draft framework"
2014-02-06T21:42:51 * clown_mtg is now known as clown
2014-02-06T21:43:04 <anastasiac> ok, Bosmon, I\'ll read throughout FLUID-5241 and see if I can draft something to address my requirements
2014-02-06T21:43:22 <Bosmon> anastasiac - cheers!
2014-02-06T21:43:31 <Bosmon> Please do add a comment to the JIRA as well, describing what your situation is
2014-02-06T21:43:45 <anastasiac> yep, that was going to be my first step
2014-02-06T21:44:25 <michelled> Bosmon: I started looking at this pull request yesterday: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/437
2014-02-06T21:44:58 <michelled> it seems that the keyboard focus tests are still failing with that change in
2014-02-06T21:45:02 <michelled> in IE11
2014-02-06T21:45:17 <michelled> and IE8, actually
2014-02-06T21:45:30 * anvk has quit
2014-02-06T21:48:36 <Bosmon> michelled - peculiarly they run for me
2014-02-06T21:48:43 <Bosmon> Just tried IE8
2014-02-06T21:48:46 <Bosmon> Let me try IE10 now
2014-02-06T21:49:43 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I wonder what could be different. the IE8 I used was Justin_o_\'s VM
2014-02-06T21:55:04 <Bosmon> michelled - just tested IE9 and it is ok
2014-02-06T21:59:12 <michelled> Bosmon, just to be clear - you merged that branch into master and then ran the tests?
2014-02-06T21:59:55 <Bosmon> ooh, no!
2014-02-06T21:59:59 <Bosmon> I just tested the branch itself
2014-02-06T22:00:11 <Bosmon> oh wow, amazing
2014-02-06T22:00:20 <Bosmon> Yes, it fails in master, let me have a look

2014-02-06T22:19:12 <Bosmon> Would you like to push the branch as it is and we can make a fresh JIRA and start thinking some more?
2014-02-06T22:40:01 <michelled> Bosmon: sure - that\'s fine
2014-02-06T22:40:04 <michelled> thanks
2014-02-06T22:40:29 <Bosmon> michelled - the problems are pretty awful although I think I understand them a bit better now
2014-02-06T22:40:35 <Bosmon> There are two separate things interacting
2014-02-06T22:40:52 <michelled> what are they?
2014-02-06T22:40:53 <Bosmon> i) IE\'s focus notification is asynchronous, and jQuery no longer lies to us that it isn\'t as it has been for the last 5 years
2014-02-06T22:41:10 <Bosmon> ii) IE refuses to ever focus any markup which was just created on this event stack - which includes anything which is part of a QUnit fixture
2014-02-06T22:41:42 <Bosmon> And this sort of suggests further cans of worms
2014-02-06T22:42:08 <Bosmon> iii) If we were to write the "selectable" component today, there\'s no way we would write it as it is now - that is, using the raw "focused state" of the DOM as its model
2014-02-06T22:42:45 <Bosmon> I think it\'s fairly clear that noone in the jQuery community is going to express any interest in this so I suggest that we rewrite it to our current standards after the 1.5 release
2014-02-06T22:43:23 <Bosmon> But I think at the very least we need to rewrite this test using the IoC testing framework which already means that people won\'t be able to run our tests without using our framework anyway
2014-02-06T22:44:16 <Bosmon> I guess I could try to fix them up the way they are now but it would mean writing zillions of extra closures and setTimeouts everywhere
2014-02-06T22:45:05 <Bosmon> Unfortunately it isn\'t just an issue of fixing the way we TRIGGER focus in these tests - for example, we could go back to triggering the focus event using jQuery\'s fake scheme, which can still be done using the "triggerFocus" method
2014-02-06T22:45:16 <Bosmon> THe problem is that the IMPLEMENTATION of the widget tries to trigger focus itself as well
2014-02-06T22:45:32 <Bosmon> It relies to have its effect by a) receiving focus on the container, and then b) triggering focus on an element
2014-02-06T22:46:22 <Bosmon> Now b) used to be done via jQuery as well, which explains why this test is failing "much worse" than all of our other focus-dependent ones - it is because the real implementation behaviour of the component has changed with the jQuery change, as well as just the behatiour of the tests
2014-02-06T22:46:40 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-02-06T22:47:32 <michelled> but somehow the real implementation is \'working\' in that we can use the keyboard to focus
2014-02-06T22:47:41 <Bosmon> michelled - it certainly works, yes
2014-02-06T22:47:50 <Bosmon> The issue is that it now works asynchronously rather than synchronously
2014-02-06T22:48:04 <Bosmon> But all of these tests were written at the dawn of time to expect synchronous behaviour
2014-02-06T22:48:36 <Bosmon> Now we\'ve always in fact HAD asynchonous behaviour since IE8 clearly existed when we wrote this test and implementation back in 2009 : P
2014-02-06T22:48:37 <michelled> I see
2014-02-06T22:48:48 <Bosmon> But what has happened all time is that jQuery has lied to us when triggering focus
2014-02-06T22:49:06 <Bosmon> And has directly and synchronously relayed a focus trigger to focus listeners, whether the browser honoured it or not

b'2014-02-06T00:01:38 <Bosmon> I guess it is reasonable
2014-02-06T00:01:50 <Bosmon> The obvious alternative is to make this model-based, but it\'s not clear that is really appropriate
2014-02-06T00:02:16 <Bosmon> At the very least you\'d need more emitted events in order to enable that
2014-02-06T00:03:23 <colinclark> ok, that makes sense
2014-02-06T00:03:52 <Bosmon> In the case what is being edited by this CM really is a JSON structure, it might make sense to make it appear like a model at a higher level of wrapping
2014-02-06T00:04:08 <Bosmon> But perhaps this "raw event structure" you have here is appropriate for a lower level of implementation
2014-02-06T00:04:22 * jhung1 joined the channel
2014-02-06T00:04:24 <Bosmon> But it will in general need to expose enough events to make the "model idiom" implementable
2014-02-06T00:05:09 <colinclark> Yes, that is exactly what I have been planning to do--a higher-level component responsible for recognizing when it\'s reasonable to parse the JSON and update a real model
2014-02-06T00:06:04 <colinclark> I will need to expose CM\'s change events via my wrapper\'s events
2014-02-06T00:06:20 <colinclark> is that what you\'re referring to when you say "enough events?"
2014-02-06T00:06:24 <Bosmon> yes
2014-02-06T00:06:33 <colinclark> ok
2014-02-06T00:06:39 <colinclark> yes, that\'s coming up next
2014-02-06T00:06:52 <colinclark> once I can get the previous functionality of the playground working again
2014-02-06T00:06:53 <Bosmon> great
2014-02-06T00:07:09 <Bosmon> There will be some lower-level methods you are encountering in your REVIEW that will help you with this : P
2014-02-06T00:07:16 <colinclark> this playButton component is a little ropier: http://pastie.org/8703076
2014-02-06T00:07:19 <colinclark> indeed
2014-02-06T00:07:44 <colinclark> I should probably just be apologizing at this point, since i\'ve stalled on your pull request while I work on this
2014-02-06T00:07:48 <Bosmon> Well firstly I must take moral exception to all of your "toggle" methods :)
2014-02-06T00:07:50 <colinclark> and it\'s not the correct priority :P
2014-02-06T00:08:02 <colinclark> please go ahead and elaborate, Bosmon
2014-02-06T00:08:15 <Bosmon> They amount to "implicit state" of the kind we have decried
2014-02-06T00:08:17 * jhung has quit
2014-02-06T00:08:32 <colinclark> indeed it is
2014-02-06T00:08:39 <colinclark> ok, a model for the play button
2014-02-06T00:08:47 <Bosmon> yes
2014-02-06T00:08:51 <colinclark> you should have seen Vitus\' version ;)
2014-02-06T00:08:57 <Bosmon> It would help you sleep better at night : P
2014-02-06T00:09:06 <colinclark> lol
2014-02-06T00:09:15 <colinclark> Who knew you had the cure? :P
2014-02-06T00:09:17 * yzen has quit
2014-02-06T00:13:41 <Bosmon> As well as improving its intrinsic design, it will make the button more fit to participate in our upcoming universe of MATERIALISATION STRATEGIES
2014-02-06T00:14:57 <Bosmon> Moving on, I guess your fluid.enviro.shared methods are rather terrifying
2014-02-06T00:15:32 <Bosmon> At the very least you should take them out of this class definition and put them somewhere closer to the site of use
2014-02-06T00:16:32 <Bosmon> Pardon the use of the term "class definition" : P
2014-02-06T00:17:53 <colinclark> :P
2014-02-06T00:18:10 <colinclark> they are indeed horrifying
2014-02-06T00:18:14 <colinclark> and also not going away any time soon
2014-02-06T00:18:35 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s not so bad
2014-02-06T00:18:40 <colinclark> but some day :)
2014-02-06T00:18:51 <colinclark> we talked about the appropriateness of the static environment for this
2014-02-06T00:18:55 <colinclark> maybe in Madison, I can\'t remember
2014-02-06T00:19:06 <Bosmon> Once we have implemented http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5249 the "real world" will be similar to yours : P
2014-02-06T00:19:15 <colinclark> yes
2014-02-06T00:19:16 <colinclark> that will be great
2014-02-06T00:19:17 <Bosmon> Yes, user use of the static environment will soon be banned
2014-02-06T00:20:18 <colinclark> but yes, the calls to the static environment should probably be moved up to the Playground component
2014-02-06T00:20:41 <colinclark> except that I expect people already want "just a play button I can use" with no further intervention
2014-02-06T00:20:56 * jhung1 has quit
2014-02-06T00:21:13 <Bosmon> Well, you can always distribute this listener down by means of "distributeOptions"
2014-02-06T00:21:17 <colinclark> as we\'ve seen with my current crop of new users, just showing them anything "behind the scenes" is a great way to scare the hell out of them
2014-02-06T00:21:29 <Bosmon> But it would be nicer if this function were referred to SOME kind of context even though it has a global effect
2014-02-06T00:21:42 <Bosmon> I mean, perish the thought, you might want a play button that did something slightly different : P
2014-02-06T00:22:01 <Bosmon> Or played something else
2014-02-06T00:22:19 <colinclark> "get your own play button!"
2014-02-06T00:22:39 <Bosmon> You could just stick the listeners in another grade
2014-02-06T00:22:43 <Bosmon> flock.ui.globalPlayButton
2014-02-06T00:23:13 <colinclark> I think that\'s probably the most appropriate approach for now
2014-02-06T00:23:27 <colinclark> I do get users saying "how do I make this work on iOS?"
2014-02-06T00:23:46 <colinclark> since Apple throttles any sound output unless it was initiated by a user input event
2014-02-06T00:24:26 <colinclark> ok, those are good pieces of feedback
2014-02-06T00:24:31 <Bosmon> That\'s quite nice, in a way
2014-02-06T00:24:41 <colinclark> I think it does make sense, yes
2014-02-06T00:25:09 <colinclark> especially on a device where unwanted audio synthesis could chew through a battery very quickly, and be very disruptive
2014-02-06T00:25:20 <colinclark> I have another half dozen components I will be revealing to you
2014-02-06T00:25:27 <colinclark> but I have to run for some pizza and beer with The Darcie
2014-02-06T00:25:34 <colinclark> and then I think it\'s only fair for me to finish my review of your code
2014-02-06T00:25:40 <Bosmon> I\'m still waiting for the version of Chrome which highlights a noisy tab with a special icon
2014-02-06T00:25:46 <colinclark> ah, it\'s out
2014-02-06T00:25:49 <colinclark> at least my version does it now
2014-02-06T00:26:04 <Bosmon> Or indeed the version which doesn\'t crash horribly with even a mild number of tabs in a thrashing death of memory
2014-02-06T00:26:15 <colinclark> flocking tabs now have an ugly, pixellated speaker in them when flock.enviro.shared.play() has been called :P
2014-02-06T00:26:18 <colinclark> i think it\'s great
2014-02-06T00:27:28 <Bosmon> Cool, I hope you have a great PIEZZA!
2014-02-06T00:27:33 <Bosmon> Will you be watching anything this evening?

2014-02-06T15:07:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  I see that the pull request to update fluid to the latest versions of jQuery, etc. was merged.  Is there a date for a new version to be released?  I ask because if it\'s coming soon I\'d rather start working with a release than with master.
2014-02-06T15:11:27 <Justin_o_> the-t-in-rtf: hello... we don\'t yet have an official date planned. There are still a few more changes we\'d like to get in. However, I\'d expect that we will have a release out for the the end of this month or early next.

2014-02-06T15:36:00 <jhung> yep
2014-02-06T15:36:02 <anastasiac> did you have to do any custom building of css to get the 8 cols?
2014-02-06T15:36:10 <anastasiac> using sass, for example?
2014-02-06T15:36:49 <jhung> anastasiac: I wouldn\'t use columns in that case. A simple list would be sufficient. Maybe use bootstrap navbar and restyle it?
2014-02-06T15:37:14 <anastasiac> ok, I\'ll try something like that
2014-02-06T15:37:17 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2014-02-06T15:37:45 <jhung> np anastasiac. Have you tried using Learner Options on your prototype yet?
2014-02-06T15:37:59 <anastasiac> not yet. how\'s it going?

2014-02-06T15:40:14 <anastasiac> jhung, also: are you using html5 elements? <header>, <sections> etc
2014-02-06T15:40:43 <jhung> anastasiac: still trying to figure out if I have all the required pieces, so I haven\'t been successful yet.
2014-02-06T15:41:15 <jhung> anastasiac: yes I have been using semantic markup where possible.
2014-02-06T15:41:16 <anastasiac> jhung, have you tried looking at the demo files inside infusion? they include all necessary files individually
2014-02-06T15:41:46 <anastasiac> or, jhung, create a custom build of infusion on the command line, that\'s probably easiest
2014-02-06T15:42:08 <jhung> yes anastasiac. I\'ve actually copied those lines and replaced the path as necessary, but no luck.

2014-02-06T16:21:29 <Justin_o_> jhung, anastasiac: do you want to chat about the css framework stuff tomorrow? Will you have time and will there be enough to talk about then?
2014-02-06T16:21:44 <anastasiac> I\'m certainly forming an opinion :-)
2014-02-06T16:21:56 <jhung> Justin_o_: I am away tomorrow Justin_o_ how about Monday morning?
2014-02-06T16:22:23 <anastasiac> works for me
2014-02-06T16:22:32 <anastasiac> after 10am
2014-02-06T16:23:53 <jhung> sure
2014-02-06T16:45:52 <jhung> Justin_o_, anastasiac: should we try converting some of the fss theme to use foundation / bootstrap? Would this be useful in our evaluation?
2014-02-06T16:46:43 <Justin_o_> anastasiac: will monday be too late for you, if you are away the rest of the week.. would you rather chat this afternoon?
2014-02-06T16:46:45 <anastasiac> Justin_o_, I wonder whether or not it would be time-effective. It might be better to just use what\'s there, and note where a problem is a result of the bad theme and would be solved
2014-02-06T16:47:44 <Justin_o_> anastasiac, jhung: whatever you both think is best is fine with me
2014-02-06T16:48:05 <Justin_o_> i suppose it may end up just being an exercise in less/sass to upgrade the themes anyways

2014-02-06T16:48:51 <jhung> Justin_o_, anastasiac this afternoon would be okay for me.
