b'2014-02-04T20:42:50 <cindyli1> :)
2014-02-04T20:43:04 <Bosmon> I see
2014-02-04T20:43:07 <Bosmon> That\'s not what it should say : P
2014-02-04T20:43:54 <cindyli1> let\'s not worry about that error if we know for sure line 52 is wrong
2014-02-04T20:44:07 <Bosmon> Well, the error should be correct : P
2014-02-04T20:44:31 <Bosmon> This is certainly a very bulky way of expressing this panel
2014-02-04T20:44:38 <Bosmon> Are you getting any value from using the renderer at all?
2014-02-04T20:44:46 <Bosmon> It seems that the whole thing would be better expressed with a dynamic grade
2014-02-04T20:45:35 <cindyli1> our first approach was to use subcomponents to render those subpanels, but having problem with destroy()
2014-02-04T20:45:52 <Bosmon> What kind of problem
2014-02-04T20:47:16 <cindyli1> the metadata demo has a "restart demo" button. clicking on that button should reset everything. as i rmb, destroy() didn\'t fully destroy things. some applier references were left and used by same components that were re-instantiated
2014-02-04T20:47:21 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-04T20:47:28 <Bosmon> But that presumably wasn\'t using FLUID-3674
2014-02-04T20:47:35 <cindyli1> no, not at all
2014-02-04T20:47:41 <Bosmon> This kind of thing should work properly now
2014-02-04T20:47:56 <cindyli1> oh. surprising\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-02-04T20:47:58 <cindyli1> really?
2014-02-04T20:48:01 <Bosmon> ...
2014-02-04T20:48:03 <cindyli1> what\'s been fixed?
2014-02-04T20:48:08 <Bosmon> Surprising that things should work? : P
2014-02-04T20:48:17 <cindyli1> lol exactly
2014-02-04T20:48:30 <Bosmon> Come on, there\'s barely a single line of implementation in common between the old and the new impl : P
2014-02-04T20:48:40 <Bosmon> Would would hope that the effect should generally have been of making things work : P
2014-02-04T20:48:44 <Bosmon> One would hope
2014-02-04T20:48:50 <Bosmon> And if it isn\'t, we can now fix it
2014-02-04T20:49:04 <Bosmon> Since this is an implementation we plan to commit to, unlike the old one which we wouldn\'t fix because we planned to throw it away
2014-02-04T20:49:47 <cindyli1> ok, you mean to use 3674 branch to try again
2014-02-04T20:50:04 <cindyli1> cool. i certainly can do that
2014-02-04T20:50:08 <Bosmon> yes
2014-02-04T20:50:24 <Bosmon> Yes, please do try to avoid use of the renderer since that still *is* something we\'re planning to throw away : P
2014-02-04T20:52:07 <cindyli1> for sure. if dynamic grades had worked at our first try, you wouldn\'t have seen this conditional renderer here ;)
2014-02-04T20:52:23 <cindyli1> thanks, Bosmon

2014-02-04T17:57:13 <cindyli> Justin_o_: regarding your pull request for the grunt plugin, module names in "include" and "exclude" options (https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5265/Gruntfile.js#L41) should be matching the name defined in the dependencies json file (https://github.com/jobara/grunt-modulefiles/blob/FLUID-5265/test/fixtures/moduleA/moduleADependencies.json#L2), is it right?
2014-02-04T17:57:55 <Justin_o_> cindyli: yes
2014-02-04T17:58:19 <cindyli> Justin_o_: are the module names defined in json files required to be same as module directory names?
2014-02-04T17:58:33 <cindyli> my answer would be no
2014-02-04T17:58:55 <cindyli> but seems it is a requirement in the plugin
2014-02-04T18:00:36 <Justin_o_> cindyli: no they are not, it\'s just for readability that they are in this case

2014-02-04T20:28:50 <cindyli1> hi Bosmon
2014-02-04T20:29:01 <Bosmon> hi cindyli1!
2014-02-04T20:29:55 <cindyli1> the source and target defined in the new model relay usually are pointing to two component models I guess. is that right?
2014-02-04T20:30:13 <cindyli1> in this component - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/js/videoMetadataPanel.js
2014-02-04T20:30:51 <cindyli1> can i use the new model relay btw "fluid.metadata.videoMetadataPanel" at line 27 and "fluid.metadata.videoPanel" at line 44, Bosmon?
2014-02-04T20:31:36 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - with difficulty.....
2014-02-04T20:31:50 <cindyli1> ya, how to reference to videoPanel model
2014-02-04T20:32:20 <Bosmon> Well
2014-02-04T20:32:25 <Bosmon> In theory you don\'t need to do anything : P
2014-02-04T20:32:36 <Bosmon> What you have written there will just give you relay for free, once you take the "sourceApplier" bit out
2014-02-04T20:32:57 <Bosmon> In the new world, any IoC references between models automatically sets up relay
2014-02-04T20:33:06 <Bosmon> So you can just AXE EVERYTHING
2014-02-04T20:33:50 <cindyli1> Bosmon: the model for "fluid.metadata.videoMetadataPanel" is turning into this structure:
2014-02-04T20:33:51 <cindyli1> model: {
2014-02-04T20:33:51 <cindyli1> accessModel: [],              // An array of any of these values: "visual", "audio"
2014-02-04T20:33:51 <cindyli1> accessibilityHazard: [],      // An array of one of these values: "flashing" or "unFlashing"
2014-02-04T20:33:51 <cindyli1> accessibilityFeature: [],     // An array of any of these values: "highContrast", "signLanguage", "captions"
2014-02-04T20:33:51 <cindyli1> keywords: [],                 // An array of any of these values: "dialogue", "soundtrack", "sound effect"
2014-02-04T20:33:52 <cindyli1> captions: []                  // An array of caption urls
2014-02-04T20:33:52 <cindyli1> }
2014-02-04T20:34:05 <cindyli1> while videoPanel model will look like:
2014-02-04T20:34:16 <cindyli1> model: {
2014-02-04T20:34:17 <cindyli1> highContrast: false,
2014-02-04T20:34:17 <cindyli1> signLanguage: false,
2014-02-04T20:34:17 <cindyli1> flashing: "unknown" // flashing, noFlashing are alternatives
2014-02-04T20:34:17 <cindyli1> },
2014-02-04T20:34:28 <cindyli1> so won\'t be free ;)
2014-02-04T20:35:30 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - "is turning into"?
2014-02-04T20:36:05 <Bosmon> Well, you can just set up a transforming relay
2014-02-04T20:36:09 <Bosmon> How is this working at the moment?
2014-02-04T20:36:18 <cindyli1> videoMetadataPanel holds the top level model that we hope it\'s more readable and sensible to integrators
2014-02-04T20:37:33 <cindyli1> at the moment, videoMetadataPanel model is a combined set of models from all its subpanels and the new relay is not needed
2014-02-04T20:37:42 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-04T20:38:12 <Bosmon> Well, it seems your safest option is to refer upwards with the relay to the parent, rather than trying to refer downwards to the panel
2014-02-04T20:38:31 <Bosmon> Make sure that anything you want updated via transforming relay is initially set to "undefined"
2014-02-04T20:38:42 <Bosmon> That is, is just empty
2014-02-04T20:40:47 <cindyli1> ok, Bosmon. the approach I\'m trying - http://pastie.org/8699073
2014-02-04T20:41:20 <cindyli1> does it look ok? I don\'t think line 52 would work tho
2014-02-04T20:41:33 <Bosmon> Yes, line 52 is wrong
2014-02-04T20:41:38 <Bosmon> You can only connect actual models
2014-02-04T20:42:01 <Bosmon> It should actually give you an error on startup telling you about this
2014-02-04T20:42:49 <cindyli1> it does throw me an error from DataBinding.js - ref.charAt is not a function\xc2\xa0
