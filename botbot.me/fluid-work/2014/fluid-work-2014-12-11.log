b'2014-12-11T19:22:53 <Bosmon> cindyli - no, we can never support that
2014-12-11T19:23:04 <Bosmon> The system must always be able to schedule the application of the constraints how it likes
2014-12-11T19:26:51 <cindyli> ok

2014-12-11T19:33:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: in terms of your pull request for valueMapper, can you address this comment when you have time - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/572#diff-for-comment-21116047
2014-12-11T19:33:14 <cindyli> then we can merge it
2014-12-11T19:33:54 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I am looking at this collection of issues now
2014-12-11T19:34:06 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2014-12-11T19:34:09 <Bosmon> Wondering whether we should do anything about this insufferable "defaultOutputValue" issue
2014-12-11T19:34:35 <Bosmon> I am thinking this has always been an unhelpful and misleading feature and we should just withdraw it
2014-12-11T19:35:59 <Bosmon> You may remember that earlier we dealt with http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5473
2014-12-11T19:37:51 <Bosmon> Well
2014-12-11T19:38:08 <Bosmon> I guess if we withdraw "defaultOutputValue" we would need to withdraw "defaultInputValue" too
2014-12-11T19:38:11 <Bosmon> Which seems a step too far
2014-12-11T19:38:42 <Bosmon> But I think your experience is going to be typical of everyone who uses the valueMapper
2014-12-11T19:39:08 <Bosmon> In that they will interpret "defaultOutputValue" as "a value to be used when no case matches" rather than "a value which should be supplied for outputValue if none was specified"
2014-12-11T19:40:29 <Bosmon> Hi michelled - you assigned https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566 to me?
2014-12-11T19:44:26 <michelled> only because it looked like you were the reviewer Bosmon
2014-12-11T19:44:36 <michelled> should it be assigned to someone else?
2014-12-11T19:45:03 <Bosmon> michelled - I\'m not sure what the "assigned" status of a pull request means, in terms of workflow
2014-12-11T19:46:31 <michelled> that\'s a good question - I was thinking it made sense for the person reviewing to have the pull request assigned to them since the person doing the work opened the pull request
2014-12-11T19:46:57 <michelled> but we can pass the assigned back and forth as we work on them, if that\'s clearer

2014-12-11T19:57:55 <slim_jim> is this right channel for GPII arch discussions? I just notice the wiki home page also mentions  #fluid-tech but that seems pretty quiet

2014-12-11T20:02:15 <Bosmon> You can ask in either, slim_jim
2014-12-11T20:03:34 <slim_jim> Bosmon: OK. SO I guess I need to lurk in both too.
2014-12-11T20:10:28 <Bosmon> We\'ve tended on rare occasions to overflow into #fluid-tech if i) this channel was very busy and ii) we were having a particularly technical and long-wided discussion

2014-12-11T20:28:44 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, created a standard transform component, but seems still having the same issue that returning "undefined" doesn\'t prevent the undesired input from being populated into the model - http://pastebin.com/dXDWhmty
2014-12-11T20:28:54 <cindyli> also tried returning false, same issue
2014-12-11T20:29:06 <cindyli> no, not same, false actually gets returned
2014-12-11T20:29:23 <cindyli> did i miss something?
2014-12-11T20:32:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - when you say "the undesired input is populated into the model"
2014-12-11T20:32:46 <Bosmon> What actually appears there?
2014-12-11T20:33:11 * yzen joined the channel
2014-12-11T20:35:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: the source and target of the transformation is {that}.model.value, if this value === "aaa", I expect the model value won\'t be changed and still have the old value, however, the new model.value becomes "aaa"
2014-12-11T20:35:33 <Bosmon> Ah, sorry, I misunderstood your setup, cindyli
2014-12-11T20:35:42 <cindyli> ok
2014-12-11T20:35:57 <Bosmon> This procedure is only possible if there are two separate model paths - it\'s impossible that the same slot could hold BOTH a string and a converted number
2014-12-11T20:36:12 <cindyli> ah. ok
2014-12-11T20:36:15 <cindyli> try again
2014-12-11T20:36:17 <Bosmon> You need to set up a relay with your string converted between one path, stringValue, and another one, value
2014-12-11T20:36:25 <Bosmon> And the limit range, naturally, is only applied to "value"
2014-12-11T20:37:23 <cindyli> ok
2014-12-11T20:40:09 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - I\'ve updated my pull request at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/572 - thanks for looking at it
2014-12-11T20:40:13 <Justin_o> michelled: good idea about the "Needs a fix" label
2014-12-11T20:40:43 <Bosmon> I\'ve also added a comment on FLUID-5512 itself and some more notes at http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+on+valueMapper+Requirements
2014-12-11T20:40:52 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2014-12-11T20:44:03 <cindyli> Bosmon: in "a relay with your string converted between one path, stringValue, and another one, value", how can I prevent the target "value" being populated when stringValue === "aaa"? by returning undefined?
2014-12-11T20:44:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - right
2014-12-11T20:44:17 <cindyli> ok, trying
2014-12-11T20:50:20 <cindyli> works like a charm, Bosmon
2014-12-11T20:50:26 <cindyli> THANKS!!
2014-12-11T20:50:31 <Bosmon> no problem
2014-12-11T20:50:34 <Bosmon> Sorry it took so long
2014-12-11T20:50:52 <Bosmon> This should really be a standard part of the framework, but even this pretty standard kind of work is pretty new...
2014-12-11T20:51:21 <cindyli> nah, that\'s fine, I learned new things by going thru this route :)

2014-12-11T23:07:19 <jhernandez> Bosmon7: Bosmon why?
2014-12-11T23:08:33 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I think it makes no sense to have 1 model per browser
2014-12-11T23:08:43 <Bosmon> The idea is that the model is attached to the SETTINGS
2014-12-11T23:08:47 <Bosmon> THE SETTINGS!
2014-12-11T23:08:50 <jhernandez> hahaha
2014-12-11T23:09:07 <jhernandez> ok
2014-12-11T23:09:25 <jhernandez> but, WHAT SETTINGS - ALL THEM?!?
2014-12-11T23:09:48 <Bosmon> Your settings handler is the handler.... for a particular "application"
2014-12-11T23:10:09 <jhernandez> I mean, if I\'m chrome, I want my settings, not firefox\'
2014-12-11T23:10:14 <Bosmon> Quite
2014-12-11T23:10:27 <Bosmon> Your job is to maintain settings PER APPLICATION
2014-12-11T23:10:32 <Bosmon> Not PER CLIENT
2014-12-11T23:10:58 <jhernandez> oh
2014-12-11T23:10:59 <Bosmon> PER APPLICATION, VVANTTUNNEZZ!
2014-12-11T23:11:01 <jhernandez> right
2014-12-11T23:11:05 <jhernandez> RIGHT!!!!!
2014-12-11T23:12:28 <jhernandez> initially i put the id
2014-12-11T23:12:51 <jhernandez> BUT
2014-12-11T23:13:19 <jhernandez> ok
2014-12-11T23:14:09 * jessm has quit
2014-12-11T23:14:49 <jhernandez> ok, I was thinking about the possibility to have conflicts between multiple instances of the same browser
2014-12-11T23:16:51 <jhernandez> but OFC, looking at it from other perspective, the browser can make just a little bit more of effort to keep itself in sync with the requested settings
2014-12-11T23:17:27 <Bosmon> Well it\'s the browser\'s business if it wants to keep itself connected or not
2014-12-11T23:20:18 <avtar> hey collaborators
2014-12-11T23:21:13 <avtar> amatas said that kasparnet said that the hosted prefs server and flow manager should be using the latest master
2014-12-11T23:23:18 <avtar> my question is do the docs https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/README.md need to be updated or am i dealing with a case of user error?
2014-12-11T23:24:09 <avtar> the node process fails with http://pastie.org/pastes/9774982/text?key=jrgag4cdyslcytjuz5la
2014-12-11T23:38:48 <jhernandez> Bosmon: right
2014-12-11T23:38:50 <jhernandez> avtar: hey
2014-12-11T23:39:10 <avtar> jhernandez: hiii
2014-12-11T23:39:16 <jhernandez> weird problem
2014-12-11T23:41:06 <Bosmon> Preferences server readme is wrong
2014-12-11T23:42:00 <Bosmon> Well worse than that
2014-12-11T23:42:05 <Bosmon> preferences server config is wrong
2014-12-11T23:42:19 <Bosmon> it refers to "OntologyServer" which no longer exists
2014-12-11T23:42:28 <Bosmon> Damn that KASPERNETT : P
2014-12-11T23:42:30 <jhernandez> hahaha
2014-12-11T23:43:10 <Bosmon> Trying fixing the preferencesServer.json to refer to ontologyHandler and see if it works
2014-12-11T23:43:13 <jhernandez> it\'s ontologyHandler
2014-12-11T23:43:22 <jhernandez> in any case
2014-12-11T23:43:59 <jhernandez> Bosmon: kasparnet did well, all tests are green
2014-12-11T23:44:01 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2014-12-11T23:50:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon: isn\'t just a matter of adding a fluid.require into prefServer.js?
2014-12-11T23:51:19 <Bosmon> Just fix the file, VVERNNDDEZZ!
2014-12-11T23:51:33 * kasparnet has quit
2014-12-11T23:51:47 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/preferencesServer.json#L17
2014-12-11T23:52:14 <Bosmon> The thing should throw an error on startup of course
2014-12-11T23:56:16 <avtar> sorry, i was at another computer
2014-12-11T23:56:33 <jhernandez> here it\'s working again
2014-12-11T23:57:17 <jhernandez> by removing that reference and adding the fluid.require in prefsServer.js
2014-12-11T23:57:27 <avtar> Bosmon: i\'m setting the node_env env variable to \'production\'
2014-12-11T23:57:55 <Bosmon> avtar - this is best not to do without kasparnet around
2014-12-11T23:57:57 <avtar> does it matter that the file you\'re referring to is including development.json files?
2014-12-11T23:58:01 <Bosmon> I wouldn\'t waste your time on it now
2014-12-11T23:58:03 <avtar> fair enough
2014-12-11T23:58:12 <Bosmon> Make sure you collar him before you try starting this
2014-12-11T23:58:22 <avtar> kinky :|
2014-12-11T23:58:25 <Bosmon> The production configs have not been tested since the big merge, and will almost certainly break
2014-12-11T23:59:28 <avtar> ok i\'ll hold off until tomorrow
'

b'2014-12-11T00:03:33 <Bosmon> Your vote is noted
2014-12-11T00:03:37 <Bosmon> But the requirement remains :)
2014-12-11T00:03:52 <Bosmon> This is what the GPII is for.... in order to verify that solutions actually work : P
2014-12-11T00:04:03 <Bosmon> Someday, somehow, by hook or by crook, we will have to find a way to have to deal with this issue
2014-12-11T00:05:00 <Bosmon> It sounds like we can get output-only audio on Windows without huge problems at least using RDP
2014-12-11T00:05:09 <Bosmon> Which might solve a lot of our immediate problems
2014-12-11T00:05:22 <Bosmon> I assume JAWS will not install or start without detecting some kind of sound card present
2014-12-11T00:08:39 <avtar> i agree the requirement is very valid
2014-12-11T00:09:11 <avtar> i\'ll get us to a point where we have some sort of tests being run everyday
2014-12-11T00:09:23 <avtar> and then we\'ll take it from there :)
2014-12-11T00:11:28 <avtar> we originally started this task by aiming to use a mac mini and virtualbox to run windows VMs because that was closer to simon\'s set up but getting everything on the cluster was the final goal
2014-12-11T00:12:28 <avtar> now it\'s starting to look like the mac mini and virtualbox approach will meet more of these requirements
2014-12-11T00:14:58 <avtar> the drawback is that relying on a certain class of hardware, as opposed to VMs running on this cluster or a public cloud, means that even a small number of hardware failures will have a great impact

2014-12-11T18:48:53 <Bosmon> jhernandez - no, it makes absolutely no sense at all! : P
2014-12-11T18:49:09 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2014-12-11T18:50:14 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m using "fluid.transforms.free" to transform a string to a number, such as "1.5" -> 1.5
2014-12-11T18:50:47 <cindyli> the requirement is, if the input string somehow cannot be converted to a number, for example, when the input is "alsdjfaslj"
2014-12-11T18:51:00 <cindyli> we placed the old value back
2014-12-11T18:51:27 <cindyli> btw, this all happens in "modelRelay" block
2014-12-11T18:51:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - typically for a transform which receives an inadmissible value, the convention is for it to output "undefined"
2014-12-11T18:52:14 * kasparnet has quit
2014-12-11T18:52:31 <cindyli> Bosmon: so if returned "undefined", the model value would stay as the old value?
2014-12-11T18:52:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2014-12-11T18:52:47 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon
2014-12-11T18:55:54 <michelled> Justin_o: what does it mean if a pull request is labelled
2014-12-11T18:55:57 <michelled> mothballed?
2014-12-11T18:56:31 <avtar> Bosmon, kasparnet, michelled, simonjb: the reason i mentioned that is because i was wondering if you all had time for a 15ish min call at some point today or tomorrow so that i can propose a solution that may have some drawbacks
2014-12-11T18:56:52 <michelled> I have time both days
2014-12-11T18:57:28 <simonjb> avtar: I have time both days also
2014-12-11T18:58:24 <Justin_o> michelled: where did you see that?
2014-12-11T18:58:39 <michelled> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/labels/Mothballed
2014-12-11T18:59:24 <Justin_o> michelled: i think we can define whatever labels we want https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/labels
2014-12-11T18:59:31 <Justin_o> so i\'m not sure what this one means or who made it
2014-12-11T18:59:48 <Justin_o> maybe Bosmon might know
2014-12-11T18:59:49 <michelled> Bosmon: it looks like you made the mothballed label
2014-12-11T19:00:05 <michelled> what does it mean for a pull request to be mothballed?
2014-12-11T19:02:26 <Bosmon> It means that we don\'t consider it a candidate to be merged for a while, but it contains an issue or some code that we need to keep aware of as we do other work
2014-12-11T19:02:34 <avtar> michelled, simonjb, and maybe Bosmon: how about today for that call? 15:00PM EST?
2014-12-11T19:02:37 <Bosmon> For example I\'ve written some discussion on http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5510
2014-12-11T19:02:56 <Bosmon> I\'d prefer tomorrow, I\'m really pretty ill today still
2014-12-11T19:03:06 <avtar> how about tomorrow 15:00PM EST?
2014-12-11T19:03:13 <Bosmon> ok
2014-12-11T19:03:43 <simonjb> sure
2014-12-11T19:04:49 <michelled> fine for me
2014-12-11T19:07:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: the model is still changed to the new value when "undefined" is returned - http://pastebin.com/Vn9ZgU43
2014-12-11T19:08:16 <cindyli> i\'ve traced and ensured "undefined" is returned in the case of having an input of "aaa"
2014-12-11T19:08:31 <cindyli> however, the transformed model still have a new value of "aaa", Bosmon
2014-12-11T19:09:21 <michelled> Justin_o, Bosmon: I created another label "Needs a fix" for pull requests that have only a test case to prove that an issue exists.
2014-12-11T19:10:03 <cindyli> oh, the definition of "fluid.textfieldSlider.textfield.stringToNumber" was pasted twice. ignore one of those, Bosmon.
2014-12-11T19:10:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - this is probably a misuse of the "free" transform
2014-12-11T19:10:57 <Bosmon> You should get the standard semantics if you write this as a standard transformer which has (at least) the fluid.standardOutputTransformFunction grade
2014-12-11T19:11:24 <cindyli> ok
2014-12-11T19:11:31 <Bosmon> Although I think to be honest the default behaviour should be correct if you just avoid "free" entirely and claim that the function already represents a transform by using it with "type"
2014-12-11T19:11:47 <Bosmon> Since I think the default for any unrecognised function is fluid.standardTransformFunction
2014-12-11T19:12:39 <cindyli> just curious, is it possible to pass in the old model value to a "free" transform function, Bosmon?
2014-12-11T19:12:53 <Bosmon> fluid.transforms.free is only useful where the function signature is nonstandard in some way
2014-12-11T19:12:59 <Bosmon> For example if it accepts multiple arguments etc.
2014-12-11T19:13:11 <cindyli> i see
2014-12-11T19:13:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m not sure what is meant by "the old model value"
2014-12-11T19:13:45 <cindyli> Bosmon: in this example, i\'m passing "{that}.model.value" as an argument into the "free" func
2014-12-11T19:13:58 <cindyli> is it possible to pass like "{change}.oldValue"
2014-12-11T19:14:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - no
2014-12-11T19:14:18 <cindyli> ok
2014-12-11T19:14:21 <Bosmon> With relay you are not setting up a function call as such, but a permanent relationship
2014-12-11T19:15:10 <Bosmon> So when you say "you are passing {that}.model.value as an argument" this isn\'t precisely what is happening
2014-12-11T19:15:17 <Bosmon> Although the value is indeed from time to time supplied to the function
2014-12-11T19:15:35 <Bosmon> What you\'re really doing is setting up a constraint involving the input model material and the output model material
2014-12-11T19:16:07 <Bosmon> And the system will keep applying the constraint until the model as a whole stabilises
2014-12-11T19:17:18 <Bosmon> If you were able to pass arbitrary bits of stateful stuff from outside the model ({change} or any other such thing) the system wouldn\'t be able to know when the model might stabilise
2014-12-11T19:17:38 <cindyli> i see ur point
2014-12-11T19:18:03 <Bosmon> Although I think there is a use case coming up for being able to use such things for notifications shown to the user in a UI, e.g.
2014-12-11T19:18:14 <Bosmon> That is, for diagnostics and feedback, rather than as constraint material
2014-12-11T19:19:39 <cindyli> if we can set up the order of the relay, since it\'s often there are multiple transforms defined in modelRelay, would the passing of the stateful stuff become possible, Bosmon?
2014-12-11T19:20:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - can you explain that further?
2014-12-11T19:20:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: let me pastebin some code
2014-12-11T19:21:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: http://pastebin.com/njp7zirZ, see the added "priority" key
