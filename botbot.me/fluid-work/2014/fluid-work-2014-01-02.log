2014-01-02T18:15:31 <colinclark> yzen: Are there some tests in Kettle that show the use of the new socket.io functionality?
2014-01-02T18:15:38 <colinclark> Or have we implemented it in the Flow Manager yet?
2014-01-02T18:15:44 <colinclark> I\'m curious to take a look tonight after work...
2014-01-02T18:15:57 <yzen> yes there are tests both in kettle and universal
2014-01-02T18:16:00 <colinclark> awesome
2014-01-02T18:16:04 <yzen> session tests in kettle
2014-01-02T18:16:06 <colinclark> I built a little music controller over the holiday that sends OpenSoundControl messages
2014-01-02T18:16:10 <yzen> and universal update tests in flow manager
2014-01-02T18:16:25 <colinclark> and I\'ve hooked it up to a Flocking synth running in Node.js and it works pretty nicely
2014-01-02T18:16:34 <colinclark> next step would be to hook it up to a Flocking synth running in the browser :)
2014-01-02T18:17:47 <colinclark> awesome, thanks yzen
2014-01-02T18:17:51 <yzen> sounds really cool
2014-01-02T18:17:53 <yzen> np

2014-01-02T21:08:13 <colinclark> yzen: Is it viable to start up a Kettle application without defining a server of any kind?
2014-01-02T21:09:02 <yzen> hmm
2014-01-02T21:09:03 <colinclark> I\'m trying to understand the nature of a "config"--whether it represents a set of overrides on some kind of base configuration for an app
2014-01-02T21:09:12 <colinclark> or whether it is actually just "the configuration" if you see what I mean
2014-01-02T21:09:31 <yzen> well an app is a way to declaratively specify handlers for the http server
2014-01-02T21:09:47 <yzen> so http server will not be started without the server
2014-01-02T21:09:56 <colinclark> Sorry, I should be more careful in my use of terminology
2014-01-02T21:10:10 <colinclark> So these lines here: https://github.com/colinbdclark/picat/blob/master/configs/development.json#L7-L10
2014-01-02T21:10:21 <colinclark> Do they mean "please give me a server like this"...
2014-01-02T21:10:35 <colinclark> or do they mean "please override an existing server\'s configuration with the following details?"
2014-01-02T21:10:39 <yzen> oh well yes you need to specify a server at some level as a container for the app
2014-01-02T21:10:40 <colinclark> if you see what I mean
2014-01-02T21:10:59 <colinclark> But could you make a "kettle application" without specifying a server or an app at all
2014-01-02T21:11:02 <colinclark> ?
2014-01-02T21:11:14 <yzen> colinclark: we did not get to having a default server started without specifying it, so you can have more than one
2014-01-02T21:11:22 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-02T21:11:51 <colinclark> So this really is the "base configuration" for my "Kettle application" here, as opposed to some overrides of an existing set of configuration defined by Kettle, right?
2014-01-02T21:12:30 <yzen> yes
2014-01-02T21:12:36 <yzen> so for example
2014-01-02T21:12:57 <yzen> you can have a config where you specify an empty server with an empty app
2014-01-02T21:13:18 <yzen> you can then include it into another one, where then you only specify the overrides
2014-01-02T21:14:42 <colinclark> ok
2014-01-02T21:14:51 <colinclark> So let\'s say I wanted to define a process that didn\'t respond to web requests...
2014-01-02T21:15:20 <colinclark> but perhaps was a "scraper" or something that, every hour, went out to a web page and scraped data from it and saved the results as JSON in a Couch database
2014-01-02T21:15:33 <colinclark> this is a totally fabricated scenario
2014-01-02T21:15:42 <colinclark> but it would be a Node.js app that isn\'t a server
2014-01-02T21:15:49 <colinclark> could I still use aspects of Kettle...
2014-01-02T21:16:04 <colinclark> such as the "IoC trees in configuration files" and, say, DataSources
2014-01-02T21:16:15 <colinclark> independent of actually having some kettle.server listening on some port?
2014-01-02T21:16:27 <yzen> yes
2014-01-02T21:16:34 <colinclark> ok, great
2014-01-02T21:16:53 <yzen> the config file is really just a grade defaults material
2014-01-02T21:17:02 <yzen> which it gets turned into
2014-01-02T21:17:03 <colinclark> right
2014-01-02T21:17:10 <colinclark> that\'s what I was hoping was the case
2014-01-02T21:17:17 <colinclark> I\'m looking forward to helping document Kettle
2014-01-02T21:17:22 <yzen> cool
2014-01-02T21:17:24 <colinclark> you\'ve done a really nice job on it so far
2014-01-02T21:17:30 <yzen> thanks
