b"2014-08-20T20:13:28 <anastasiac> ?
2014-08-20T20:14:07 <anastasiac> same thing here, jhung: https://github.com/fluid-project/EPUB/blob/master/physics-forces_and_motion/html/01-velocity.html#L55
2014-08-20T20:14:44 <jhung> Yes anastasiac. Text descriptions are helpful especially for math. :)
2014-08-20T20:15:36 <anastasiac> hm
2014-08-20T20:15:42 <jhung> I didn't see much benefit if it was only accessible to ATs.
2014-08-20T20:15:59 <anastasiac> well, I might try to rework it a bit. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work well with the \xe2\x80\x9cwhere theta is\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d phrases right now
2014-08-20T20:16:27 <anastasiac> Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just because it\xe2\x80\x99s written as two separate sentences
2014-08-20T20:16:56 <anastasiac> or maybe the text re-statement of the equation could be in brackets
2014-08-20T20:17:00 <anastasiac> or something
2014-08-20T20:17:05 <jhung> anastasiac: sure. Whatever we can do to make the communication clear is okay to me.
2014-08-20T20:18:14 <jhung> perhaps Bosmon has some insight he can provide on this anastasiac. I hear he's an expert at this. :)

b'2014-08-20T17:19:08 <jhung> anastasiac:  have you updated your version of Pandoc? I may try this as there seems to be something added a few days ago that may be related (ironically, it was the result of a bug I posted). https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/commit/6dce8c67601dcb89d8ff69adf83fac7d27353db2
2014-08-20T17:20:01 <jhung> As a side note, part of our markup is immortalized in their commit history. :D
2014-08-20T17:20:39 <anastasiac> interesting. Might be worth trying, jhung. Will updating require rebuilding i.e. take as long as the original install??
2014-08-20T17:21:16 <jhung> There was a simple process. I\'ll try to find it now and do it. If it breaks my installation at least you still have a working instance.
2014-08-20T17:21:21 <jhung> ^anastasiac
2014-08-20T17:21:34 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold off til you report :-)
2014-08-20T17:31:26 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2014-08-20T17:31:49 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2014-08-20T17:31:58 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2014-08-20T17:32:49 <cindyli> Bosmon: i upgraded infusion lib in the feedback tool to use the latest version that has excludeSource feature. It causes failure on some unit tests. Those tests pass with the older version of the infusion
2014-08-20T17:33:08 <cindyli> failures seem all from model listeners
2014-08-20T17:34:17 <cindyli> i\'m not sure what\'s causing the failure, just wanna make sure there\'s nothing specific to be added or changed to use the new feature, Bosmon
2014-08-20T17:36:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - there will be a failure, I think, because the previous way of binding to model events was incorrect
2014-08-20T17:36:18 <Bosmon> Before he left, Justin_o told me that he believed that it was possible to use namespaces with the short form of model Listeners
2014-08-20T17:36:30 <Bosmon> That is, to say "path.namespace" as the key to a modelListener
2014-08-20T17:36:42 <cindyli> ha
2014-08-20T17:36:56 <Bosmon> But he only believed this worked because of a bug in the implementation that would always invalidate a listener that was bound to a deeper path, even if that path value had not changed
2014-08-20T17:37:20 <Bosmon> This bug is fixed in the current infusion version, and so will cause people who believed that namespaces could be used in this way to have their listeners not notified
2014-08-20T17:37:35 <Bosmon> The key in the "modelListeners" structure is always an EL path
2014-08-20T17:37:48 <Bosmon> And if you want to use namespaces, you must use the "long form" of listener records
2014-08-20T17:38:11 <Bosmon> And when I told him this, I realised that this long form is not properly documented in our docs, although you probably know what it looks like
2014-08-20T17:38:21 <Bosmon> So I need to make a docs pull request about this
2014-08-20T17:38:30 <Bosmon> Other than this issue, you should find the new implementation works like the old
2014-08-20T17:38:46 <cindyli> ok. i see. checking\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-08-20T17:39:40 <cindyli> is the "long form" of listener records something like
2014-08-20T17:39:43 <cindyli> modelListeners: {
2014-08-20T17:39:43 <cindyli> modelPath: {
2014-08-20T17:39:43 <cindyli> listener: "...",
2014-08-20T17:39:43 <cindyli> namespace: "..."
2014-08-20T17:39:43 <cindyli> }
2014-08-20T17:39:43 <cindyli> }
2014-08-20T17:39:47 <cindyli> Bosmon: ^
2014-08-20T17:39:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - exactly
2014-08-20T17:39:55 <cindyli> cool
2014-08-20T17:41:35 * clown_mtg is now known as clown
2014-08-20T17:42:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: i guess this is no longer allowed too
2014-08-20T17:42:24 <cindyli> modelListeners: {
2014-08-20T17:42:24 <cindyli> "{tooltipHolder}.model.isDialogOpen": [{
2014-08-20T17:42:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - certainly that is allowed
2014-08-20T17:42:43 <Bosmon> That is a core feature of the implementation!
2014-08-20T17:42:54 <cindyli> haha. good to know. didn\'t know that..
2014-08-20T17:43:05 <Bosmon> Well, it is documented : P
2014-08-20T17:43:21 <Bosmon> The documentation was always clear that the keys in modelListeners were model paths
2014-08-20T17:43:32 <Bosmon> Whether they are in this model or another
2014-08-20T17:43:54 <Bosmon> But it should have been clear that there was no way to encode a namespace in such a string
2014-08-20T17:44:16 <cindyli> ok. apparently i don\'t use documentation so well unless i\'m really desperated ;)
2014-08-20T17:44:43 <Bosmon> If you used it more, you might have more of an incentive to issue pull requests against it :)
2014-08-20T17:45:32 <jhung> anastasiac: I was having an off-channel chat w michelled and she suggested that Fluid project may be a better place for the EPUB repo. The Handbook is already there which is similar content.
2014-08-20T17:46:47 <anastasiac> jhung, michelled and I are having that conversation verbally right now :-)

2014-08-20T17:53:06 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-20T17:54:18 <cindyli> Bosmon: what if the model path is a few levels deep - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/components/feedback/js/bindDialog.js#L241-L244
2014-08-20T17:54:50 <cindyli> the model paths in this case are "isFocused.icon" and/or "isHovered.icon"
2014-08-20T17:55:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - that is fine!
2014-08-20T17:56:23 <cindyli> when a dot is used in a model path, the framework can distinguish if it\'s a real path or namespace, Bosmon?
2014-08-20T17:56:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - it can\'t!
2014-08-20T17:56:52 <Bosmon> This is why namespaces never were supported
2014-08-20T17:56:59 <Bosmon> It is just that it was imagined that they were
2014-08-20T17:57:13 <Bosmon> They are only supported in the long form records
2014-08-20T17:59:13 <cindyli> yes, that\'s why i think the modelToClass block stops working with the new model listeners. this chuck of code tries to register model listeners using modelPath "isFocus.icon" - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/components/feedback/js/bindDialog.js#L47-L49
2014-08-20T17:59:27 <cindyli> those listeners are never triggered
2014-08-20T17:59:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: they are probably never registered successfully with the new model listener implementation
2014-08-20T17:59:51 <cindyli> what do you think?
2014-08-20T18:01:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - those listeners look fine
2014-08-20T18:02:37 <cindyli> ok, trying more..
2014-08-20T18:03:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - do you get an error, or just a lack of notification?
2014-08-20T18:04:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - this reference is to master
2014-08-20T18:04:07 <Bosmon> Are you saying that it is broken?
2014-08-20T18:05:14 <cindyli> it\'s broken in my FLOE-195 branch where I upgraded the infusion lib and some unit tests fail. if I switch to the older version of infusion, they pass again
2014-08-20T18:05:28 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-20T18:05:36 <cindyli> one unit test that starts failing is for bindDialog
2014-08-20T18:05:48 <Bosmon> There\'s a potential problem on line 35 that I must have missed
2014-08-20T18:06:00 <cindyli> the error is: Cannot resolve reference {that}.container since {that} has been destroyed
2014-08-20T18:06:01 <Bosmon> It says "viewComponent" rather than "viewRelayComponent"
2014-08-20T18:06:17 <cindyli> ah, good finding. let me try that
2014-08-20T18:06:23 <Bosmon> This might cause corruption in the grade information
2014-08-20T18:07:19 <cindyli> still fails
2014-08-20T18:07:26 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-20T18:07:33 <Bosmon> Best to correct it in any case
2014-08-20T18:08:39 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-08-20T18:09:17 <cindyli> agree
2014-08-20T18:27:50 <jhung> anastasiac: I got the updated pandoc running. It doesn\'t seem to fix any of the issues relating to block-level text elements.
2014-08-20T18:27:58 <anastasiac> <sigh>
2014-08-20T18:28:08 <jhung> The epub output from before and after are identical anastasiac
2014-08-20T18:29:11 <jhung> anastasiac: For now perhaps we should file a jira noting that we\'re implementing some work-arounds for Pandoc specific bugs?
2014-08-20T18:29:29 <anastasiac> I guess so, jhung
2014-08-20T18:29:37 * yzen joined the channel
2014-08-20T18:31:21 <jhung> A philosophical question anastasiac - if we put in work-arounds for a bug, are we no longer an exemplar?
2014-08-20T18:31:52 <anastasiac> in my opinion, jhung, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re still an exemplar
2014-08-20T18:32:07 <anastasiac> my understanding is that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to show just how wonderful an EPUB can be when it\xe2\x80\x99s accessible
2014-08-20T18:32:27 <anastasiac> in part to motivate people like pandoc to support epub - e.b. to add support for media overlays
2014-08-20T18:33:50 * michelled has quit
2014-08-20T18:34:42 <jhung> anastasiac:  good point.
2014-08-20T18:35:33 <jhung> did you and michelled come to a consensus on the repo location anastasiac?
2014-08-20T18:35:53 <anastasiac> fluid-project, jhung. The argument is: that space is for deliverables
2014-08-20T18:37:27 <jhung> anastasiac: makes sense. I\'ll transfer the repo no.

2014-08-20T18:49:04 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve added a section to the wiki page about media overlays. I still want to add something about a workaround for the moving iDs.
2014-08-20T18:49:11 <anastasiac> It\xe2\x80\x99s a sucky thing to have to do, but it works
2014-08-20T18:50:03 <anastasiac> jhung, I should run my workaround past you: Basically, I tried editing the generated xhtml inside the EPUB archive, replacing the messed up content with the original content
2014-08-20T18:50:42 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2014-08-20T18:52:32 <jhung> anastasiac: You may want to pass that through the EPUB validator to verify that everything is still good. The online validator has a 10MB limit, so we may need to start running our own instance when we start compiling the chapters into a single book.
2014-08-20T18:53:02 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m workout out fixing up some issues that don\xe2\x80\x99t seem related to the HTML
2014-08-20T18:53:11 <anastasiac> I downloaded epubcheck locally
2014-08-20T18:53:18 <jhung> great
2014-08-20T18:53:39 <jhung> Is there any way we can automate this anastasiac?
2014-08-20T19:04:50 <anastasiac> good question, jhung. It would certainly be nice!

2014-08-20T19:21:44 <anastasiac> mancoolgunda, hi! If you look at the Infusion code base, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that two other components use the fluid.tooltip component: InlineEdit and Pager

2014-08-20T19:27:06 <jhung> anastasiac: Should I keep sync with your FLOE-215 branch or should I leave it alone for now.

2014-08-20T19:38:55 <cindyli> nah, Bosmon, trying to understand the order of operations for model change on isDialogOpen and isTooltipOpen
2014-08-20T19:41:14 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-20T19:41:22 <Bosmon> Do you want to push up the branch and I can have a look at it?
2014-08-20T19:44:22 <cindyli> oh, Bosmon, my saver. pushing.. once sec

2014-08-20T19:50:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - I see most of the test cases failing
2014-08-20T19:51:01 <Bosmon> I guess this is what you see?
2014-08-20T19:51:06 <Bosmon> For example, "Captions panel tests"
2014-08-20T19:51:09 <cindyli> yes
2014-08-20T19:52:14 <Bosmon> In particular, "the indicator state has been set to available"
2014-08-20T19:53:14 <Bosmon> I get: 20:53:01.113:
2014-08-20T19:53:14 <Bosmon> ASSERTION FAILED: Cannot resolve reference Object { context="change", path="value", endpos=14} from component { typeName: "gpii.metadata.indicator" gradeNames: ["gpii.metadata.indicator","fluid.viewRelayComponent","fluid.commonViewComponent","fluid.standardRelayComponent","fluid.modelRelayComponent","fluid.commonModelComponent"] id: 4qxbrtnz-192} which has been destroyed
2014-08-20T19:53:21 <Bosmon> Is this the same failure you see?
2014-08-20T20:01:05 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon, for "captions panel tests"
2014-08-20T20:01:23 <cindyli> the line down below is more specific:     while resolving context value {change}.value

2014-08-20T20:11:50 <anastasiac> jhung, I guess so. The ids are currently numbered sequentially, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just for convenience. If you need to move things, move them :-)
2014-08-20T20:13:03 <anastasiac> jhung, question about this line: https://github.com/fluid-project/EPUB/blob/master/physics-forces_and_motion/html/01-velocity.html#L37
2014-08-20T20:13:27 <anastasiac> You\xe2\x80\x99ve added a text description of the equation right into the actual content of the resource. Was that intentional

2014-08-20T10:28:16 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure what you mean by "the equivalent el expressions"
2014-08-20T10:33:19 <Bosmon> Could you give examples of the kinds of expressions which don\'t work and do work?

2014-08-20T10:49:16 <the-t-in-rtf> look at the selectors.  that.locate("login") doesn\'t work but if I use that.locate(\'.user-menu-login\'), I can see the element
2014-08-20T10:50:46 <the-t-in-rtf> that.container is very useful for the wiring I\'m doing at the moment, but none of the other selectors work.
2014-08-20T10:53:29 <Bosmon> that.locate(".user-menu-login") should just fall back to giving you the container since it isn\'t a defined selector
2014-08-20T10:53:39 <Bosmon> Properly it should just give you an error, we need to update that
2014-08-20T10:54:06 <Bosmon> What return value do you get from that.locate("login")?
2014-08-20T10:55:31 <the-t-in-rtf> []
2014-08-20T10:55:36 <the-t-in-rtf> nothing, basically
2014-08-20T10:55:45 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-20T10:55:51 <Bosmon> It suggests that your markup isn\'t organised the way you think it is
2014-08-20T10:56:45 <Bosmon> And that the element which should match "login" either isn\'t present at all, or is present somewhere outside the container
2014-08-20T11:06:00 <the-t-in-rtf> For whatever reason it works now with no markup changes.  Let me back up a couple of steps and see if I can explain it.
2014-08-20T11:18:28 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, my selectors are working as expected, although I\'m having difficulty binding my own click function to an element.
2014-08-20T11:18:55 <Bosmon> cool
2014-08-20T11:19:03 <Bosmon> paste what you have in a pastie for us to see if you want
2014-08-20T11:21:49 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s in the same pirate pad, just further down.

2014-08-20T11:25:33 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - what you\'ve written there looks correct
2014-08-20T11:26:42 * slim_ has quit
2014-08-20T11:27:20 <Bosmon> You should check for the usual things - that {that}.dom.logout resolve to the element you think it does, that the click event is delivered, etc.
2014-08-20T11:31:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.  I am trying to bind a trivial alert to the same element with jQuery, I think I\'m hitting another limitation of select form elements, it doesn\'t seem to trigger anything for individual options.
2014-08-20T11:32:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I can dodge the bullet and devolve this control to a list, as this is the only pattern where there is no data element to bind a change to.
2014-08-20T11:33:15 <the-t-in-rtf> It looks like for the rest I will need to look for changes in the overall select element, which is fine.
2014-08-20T11:43:09 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that\'s right, yes
2014-08-20T11:43:26 <Bosmon> There are a lot of limitations on the delivery of raw events to native HTML controls
2014-08-20T11:43:48 <Bosmon> And yet people would have us package up things yet further, into the enigma of WEB COMPONENTS : P
2014-08-20T11:44:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Yep.  Moving the class to a list item immediately worked.
2014-08-20T11:46:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I would still rather use select elements for "choose one of these pieces of data" kind of controls, but am not overly hopeful.

2014-08-20T11:52:08 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I just replied to the list re selectboxes
2014-08-20T11:52:36 <Bosmon> It sounds like it\'s worth taking on the work as a community to hash out an accessible and stylable select box, and that noone else has done this work
2014-08-20T11:52:39 <Bosmon> I\'m happy to help organise it
2014-08-20T11:53:50 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s awesome.
2014-08-20T11:54:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I need a component like that in four or five places per screen.

2014-08-20T13:42:44 <cindyli> so far so good :)

2014-08-20T13:44:01 <cindyli> thanks for merging in justin\'s pull request for FLOE-207, Bosmon. I will have another feedback tool pull request for you soon ;)
2014-08-20T13:44:14 <Bosmon> cheers, cindyli - ping me if you need any help
2014-08-20T13:44:22 <cindyli> sure. thanks
2014-08-20T13:44:33 <Bosmon> Also I posted to the list about our selectbox issue so do chime in with anything that you and danaayotte remember from your existing work
2014-08-20T13:45:04 <cindyli> yes, i do, this is the jira about the accessibility issue with jquery combo box: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-659
2014-08-20T13:45:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - oh fantastic, thanks
2014-08-20T13:45:17 <cindyli> np
2014-08-20T13:46:59 <cindyli> Bosmon: i just tried the latest jquery autocomplete combobox. It has the exact same accessibility issue described in that jira - https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
2014-08-20T13:47:01 <danaayotte> thanks for you email Bosmon!
2014-08-20T13:47:51 <Bosmon> cheers danaayotte - it\'s somewhat fun to work on accessible widgets
2014-08-20T13:47:59 <Bosmon> After all, it\'s what everyone imagines we spend all our time on in Fluid : P
2014-08-20T13:48:34 <cindyli> PMT and PCP were using an earlier version of that combo box which has a worse accessibility issue. We put in some work around ourselves to make it work the same way as the newer jquery combo box but still not perfect

2014-08-20T13:57:38 <danaayotte> Bosmon, cindyli: I know there were a couple of JIRAs about keyboard a11y of the PMT/PCP combo box so I\'ll track those down and send to list
2014-08-20T13:58:42 <danaayotte> Bosmon: sounds fun to me :)
2014-08-20T13:59:11 <cindyli> danaayotte, Bosmon, i will send the accessibility issue to the list
2014-08-20T14:06:09 <Bosmon> Thanks, danaayotte and cindyli

2014-08-20T14:38:45 <jhung> anastasiac: I made changes to my master. Can you take a look and see if it looks okay?
2014-08-20T14:38:53 <anastasiac> will do, jhung
2014-08-20T14:39:01 <anastasiac> jhung, did you see my emai to the pandoc list last night?
2014-08-20T14:40:11 <jhung> yes I did.  The moving of IDs is problematic to say the least anastasiac
2014-08-20T14:40:25 <anastasiac> no response yet
2014-08-20T14:42:40 <jhung> I\'m finding that pandoc also strips out aria-labels in certain circumstances. I\'m trying to get a definitive test case for that now. It seems that aria-label on <p> gets removed.
2014-08-20T14:43:42 <anastasiac> jhung, it looked like pandoc was stripping IDs off of <p> as well; I had to change them all to <div>
2014-08-20T14:43:59 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m going to double-check whether or not they were being moved, or removed
2014-08-20T14:44:21 <anastasiac> I plan to file an issue with pandoc. Messing with IDs is bad bad bad
2014-08-20T14:45:59 <jhung> anastasiac: agreed! Especially when IDs are needed for media overlays which is part of the EPUB 3 spec.
2014-08-20T14:54:50 <jhung> anastasiac: it seems our issues may be related. Attributes are being stripped from <p> elements (aria-label, aria-describedby, and IDs). But if you use a DIV or a Span, the attributes remain on the div or span.
2014-08-20T14:55:37 <anastasiac> well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a start, jhung, at least it keeps the aria stuff
2014-08-20T14:55:52 * michelled has quit
2014-08-20T14:56:27 <jhung> yes but we\'ll have to use extra spans and divs if we want to preserve the attributes. Not great but at least it\'s a work-around.
2014-08-20T14:57:33 <jhung> I\'ll reply to your post on the list with my findings.
2014-08-20T15:02:58 <anastasiac> jhung, the paragraphs could simply be replaced by divs, so that would reduce some of the extra elements
2014-08-20T15:04:48 <jhung> anastasiac: true. In the case of <h2>\xe2\x80\xa6</h2>, maybe if we add a span within the header it would behave properly?
2014-08-20T15:05:22 <anastasiac> we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to try it
2014-08-20T15:08:17 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding your EPUB github repo: looks good! In the \xe2\x80\x9cUsing Pandoc\xe2\x80\x9d section, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some command lines that aren\xe2\x80\x99t rendering as code; Also, in the opening \xe2\x80\x9cdirectory structure\xe2\x80\x9d sections, you might want to add a note that individual book audio/video folders might contain further setup instructions, so people know to look for that
2014-08-20T15:10:08 <jhung> thanks anastasiac
2014-08-20T15:17:10 <jhung> anastasiac:  updated.
2014-08-20T15:23:06 <anastasiac> jhung, your repo looks good!
2014-08-20T15:24:51 <jhung> great anastasiac! I will transfer ownership to a project now. Which project did we decide this was going to live under? FLOE?
2014-08-20T15:27:24 <anastasiac> jhung, I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall us deciding, but I do recall someone saying it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to move a repo.
2014-08-20T15:27:40 <anastasiac> jhung, I think inclusive-design might be a better choice

2014-08-20T15:37:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Does anyone have a good example of a fluid component that listens for a model change?
2014-08-20T15:50:44 <jhung> anastasiac: I added testing results to the EPUB notes page.
2014-08-20T15:50:56 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung, good idea
2014-08-20T15:52:17 <jhung> anastasiac: Also when you add your notes about adding media overlays, can you also document how you used Audacity and the awk/sed script?
2014-08-20T15:52:29 <anastasiac> will do, jhung
2014-08-20T15:53:26 <the-t-in-rtf> This one seems like what I need, just the modelChanged event:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textfieldSlider/js/TextfieldSlider.js
2014-08-20T15:53:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Please scream if that is out of date or uses practices that I should avoid.
2014-08-20T15:53:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Otherwise I will work from that.

2014-08-20T17:01:42 <anastasiac> jhung, a question about your pandoc testing. The inputs and outputs you put on the wiki page look like pandoc is actually inserting elements \xe2\x80\x93 wrapping headers in section elements? wrapping spans in paragraphs? Is this the case?
2014-08-20T17:02:26 <jhung> anastasiac: yes. In the case of adding sections, the attributes were moved from the header to the section.
2014-08-20T17:02:55 <anastasiac> what the h#$% are they doing??
2014-08-20T17:03:17 <jhung> lol funny you should ask\xe2\x80\xa6 I was just looking at the code anastasiac. https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/src/Text/Pandoc/Readers/HTML.hs
