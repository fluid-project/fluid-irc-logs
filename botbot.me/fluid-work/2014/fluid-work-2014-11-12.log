b'2014-11-12T17:06:28 <Bosmon7> And for those queues which are sensitive to a particular time threshold, 3 patterns of delays per test
2014-11-12T17:06:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: what does that mean exactly
2014-11-12T17:07:13 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - well, 4 actually
2014-11-12T17:07:23 <Justin_o> can you give me an example of that
2014-11-12T17:07:51 <Bosmon7> Given a pattern of 2 "gaps" between 3 requests, there are 4 combinations of delays where each one is separately lower than the threshhold or greater than the threshold
2014-11-12T17:08:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the queue should always execute the first and last item though
2014-11-12T17:08:23 <Justin_o> so it could only ever drop the middle one
2014-11-12T17:08:54 <Justin_o> so changing the duration of a request will only result in either all running or only the first and last
2014-11-12T17:09:23 <Bosmon7> That is, if L is a delay lower than the threshold and H is one higher, you should test patterns LL, LH, HL and HH
2014-11-12T17:09:23 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - sure - just because there are only 2 possible outcomes, doesn\'t mean that there are only 2 possible faults your implementation could have :)
2014-11-12T17:09:23 <Bosmon7> Testing is the process of assuring yourself that you don\'t have faults, not observing all possible outcomes : p
2014-11-12T17:09:36 <colinclark> +- 50 ms, in my experience, is perhaps expecting a lot from setTimeout running in the main thread
2014-11-12T17:09:47 <colinclark> At least in Firefox
2014-11-12T17:10:22 <Bosmon7> colinclark - but perhaps that\'s only risky in the case the tests are otherwise CPU-bound?
2014-11-12T17:10:37 <colinclark> It\'s not entirely clear to me
2014-11-12T17:10:51 <colinclark> but the Flocking scheduler runs its timers in a Web Worker
2014-11-12T17:10:55 <colinclark> which provides greater stability
2014-11-12T17:11:03 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-11-12T17:11:15 <colinclark> and when I schedule fairly short intervals in succession, failure does occur occasionally above the 50 ms threshold
2014-11-12T17:11:20 <colinclark> but probably very occasionally
2014-11-12T17:11:28 <colinclark> it\'s quite bad, unforunately
2014-11-12T17:11:46 <Justin_o> :(
2014-11-12T17:11:50 * jhernandez has quit
2014-11-12T17:11:51 <colinclark> I think it\'s probably a good number to start with
2014-11-12T17:11:52 <colinclark> 50 ms
2014-11-12T17:11:57 <Bosmon7> I imagine we could consider that approach if Justin_o\'s tests don\'t appear to execute reliably - and if we think they are too slow with higher durations and wider tolerances
2014-11-12T17:12:02 <colinclark> and see if we get problematic failures in FF over time
2014-11-12T17:12:20 <Justin_o> sounds like a  plan
2014-11-12T17:12:23 <colinclark> I would avoid it as much as you can--running timers in workers
2014-11-12T17:12:24 <colinclark> it\'s complex
2014-11-12T17:13:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes.. it sounded like that
2014-11-12T17:13:01 <Bosmon7> colinclark - they can\'t call back into the main thread, can they?
2014-11-12T17:13:02 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-11-12T17:13:11 * jhernandez has quit
2014-11-12T17:13:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: you can pass messages
2014-11-12T17:13:24 <colinclark> My scheduler sends postMessage() messages between the two universes
2014-11-12T17:13:32 <colinclark> which means its still subject to jitter in the main thread
2014-11-12T17:13:50 <colinclark> so it\'s really not much of a viable solution
2014-11-12T17:13:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i have a question about your L\'s and H\'s are you referring to delay and duration there
2014-11-12T17:13:53 <Justin_o> not sure exactly how though
2014-11-12T17:14:11 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I\'m speaking about the delays between the requests
2014-11-12T17:14:20 <Bosmon7> It\'s ok to have the "duration" as a constant across all the fixtures
2014-11-12T17:14:35 <Bosmon7> And vary the delays relative to that
2014-11-12T17:14:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i see
2014-11-12T17:14:49 <Bosmon7> Well
2014-11-12T17:14:51 <Justin_o> i have it sort of backwards then
2014-11-12T17:15:11 <Justin_o> or maybe not
2014-11-12T17:15:17 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - varying the duration is also acceptable
2014-11-12T17:15:25 <Bosmon7> It\'s just I don\'t think we need to vary both
2014-11-12T17:15:38 <Bosmon7> As long as we can test all possible patterns with which the requests could overlap one another
2014-11-12T17:15:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. i\'ll experiment with this a bit.. i have a feeling i won\'t get to it all today though with the community meeting and soccer
2014-11-12T17:15:58 <Bosmon7> **SOW-CHHER**!!!
2014-11-12T17:16:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: your national sport :)
2014-11-12T17:16:36 <Bosmon7> So colinclark - in terms of "observing jitter in the main thread"
2014-11-12T17:17:17 <Bosmon7> Isn\'t it the case that by the time the main thread has got around to servicing the "postMessage" directed to it from the other world, that it has been subjected to all the jitter that a setTimeout would have exposed it to anyway?
2014-11-12T17:17:25 <Bosmon7> Or does this still work out better?
2014-11-12T17:17:59 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-11-12T17:18:57 <colinclark> It seems to still work better, yes
2014-11-12T17:19:12 * Bosmon8 joined the channel
2014-11-12T17:19:28 <colinclark> In part, I think, due to the fact that postMessage isn\'t throttled
2014-11-12T17:19:50 <Bosmon8> colinclark - interesting
2014-11-12T17:19:56 <colinclark> The more important reason why I use this strategy is because setTimeout is also throttled when the tab isn\'t active
2014-11-12T17:20:06 <colinclark> but the workers are not
2014-11-12T17:20:24 <colinclark> and appear to respond still to postMessage requests
2014-11-12T17:20:49 <colinclark> it\'s not perfect or even in the range of good, but it is sufficient for coarse-grained scheduling
2014-11-12T17:21:01 <colinclark> fine-grained scheduling in Flocking will soon be driven off the real-time sample clock
2014-11-12T17:21:23 <Bosmon8> yet another peculiar "arms race"
2014-11-12T17:21:23 <Bosmon8> Reminiscent of my attempts to paint my ceiling in increasingly white shades of white
2014-11-12T17:21:23 <Bosmon8> colinclark - which API gives you access to that clock?
2014-11-12T17:21:29 <colinclark> The Web Audio API
2014-11-12T17:22:01 <colinclark> which is driven bhy a realtime-scheduled thread behind the scenes
2014-11-12T17:22:08 <colinclark> i.e. a thread that has very high priority with the kernel
2014-11-12T17:22:26 <Bosmon8> What horrifying modernity

2014-11-12T17:22:49 <colinclark> :P
2014-11-12T17:22:56 <Bosmon8> I\'m waiting for the web-based "DVD burning API" .......
2014-11-12T17:23:07 <colinclark> Justin_o: What\'s he talking about?
2014-11-12T17:23:10 <colinclark> What\'s a "DVD"?
2014-11-12T17:23:14 <Bosmon8> hahahaha
2014-11-12T17:23:17 <colinclark> Is it kind of like a vinyl record?
2014-11-12T17:23:29 <Bosmon8> It\'s very similar yes
2014-11-12T17:23:34 <Bosmon8> You can throw them through the air, spinning
2014-11-12T17:23:38 <Bosmon8> Very much like a MACBOOK AIR
2014-11-12T17:23:43 <colinclark> wooo
2014-11-12T17:23:45 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon8: lol
2014-11-12T17:24:16 <colinclark> Justin_o: I guess a DVD must be like a USB stick, but for our grandparents!
2014-11-12T17:24:21 <Bosmon8> Actually this is a good point
2014-11-12T17:24:32 <Bosmon8> Apple is yet to make their great entry into the world of **CIRCULAR COMPUTING**
2014-11-12T17:24:46 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99ve updated my pull requests
2014-11-12T17:25:17 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m wondering when we\'ll see those disappear.. you can already transfer things pretty easily via airdrop or through some form of cloud storage
2014-11-12T17:27:00 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - not so easily, if the most modern wireless standard your laptop supports is "g" : P
2014-11-12T17:29:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon8: oh sorry.. I hope you have a fast ethernet port
2014-11-12T17:29:33 <Bosmon8> Justin_o - actually yes
2014-11-12T17:29:39 <Bosmon8> It\'s the only reasonable thing on this machine
2014-11-12T17:29:45 <Bosmon8> Since it doesn\'t even have USB3
2014-11-12T17:29:49 <Bosmon8> Thankfully it has gigabit ethernet
2014-11-12T17:30:04 <Bosmon8> A rather weird token of IBM\'s priorities
2014-11-12T17:32:37 <Justin_o> :) that\'s fortunate at least, so you can still access the cloud through a wire... but USB3 is a nice speed boost
2014-11-12T17:33:58 <Justin_o> we\'re probably moving towards a world where most computer upgrades will be done via some externally tethered device (e.g. thunderbolt drive, external disk drive) or via the cloud

2014-11-12T16:24:56 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m wondering how we got the simulation to default to standalone and use keyboard a11y in the EPUB. Did we modify the phet source to do that? That was going to be my approach, but was wondering if you did it an easier way. The reason I\'m asking is that I need to do this for the updated sim.
2014-11-12T16:25:21 <anastasiac> jhung, I recall that we modified the source code so that those were the defaults

2014-11-12T16:58:43 <Bosmon7> Hi there Justin_o
2014-11-12T16:58:45 <Bosmon7> I am here now
2014-11-12T16:58:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello
2014-11-12T16:59:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: if you look back in the logs i was pinging you about setTimeout precesion
2014-11-12T16:59:15 <Justin_o> so i take it that it\'s not very precise
2014-11-12T16:59:18 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - ok, yes
2014-11-12T16:59:23 <Bosmon7> You should assume that it is quite bad
2014-11-12T16:59:29 * jhernandez joined the channel
2014-11-12T16:59:30 <Justin_o> I am using to simulate delays and durations
2014-11-12T16:59:36 <Bosmon7> I\'d say that a tolerance of about 100ms should be reasonable for your tests
2014-11-12T16:59:38 <Justin_o> so my tests are failing because of this
2014-11-12T16:59:42 <Justin_o> ah okay
2014-11-12T16:59:45 <Bosmon7> That is, you should accept any time of arrival that is +/- 50ms of the proper time
2014-11-12T17:00:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: should i make the spread between delays a minimum of 50ms and durations too
2014-11-12T17:00:14 <Bosmon7> There\'s of course still a nonzero chance that they could fail if the machine is heavily loaded or slow
2014-11-12T17:00:28 <Bosmon7> But this should be enough to make tests which pass "virtually all the time"
2014-11-12T17:00:37 <Bosmon7> For example my CachingTests.js are run to this kind of precision
2014-11-12T17:00:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: or should i try to implement my own timer using web workers or something similar
2014-11-12T17:00:48 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - no, you should not : P
2014-11-12T17:01:05 <Bosmon7> And they fail actually less often than some of our other tests....
2014-11-12T17:01:10 <Justin_o> i take it that no is referring to the latter :)
2014-11-12T17:02:11 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - right - not only to say, we still support some platforms where web workers are not available
2014-11-12T17:02:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. so i should have minimum durations and delays of 100ms
2014-11-12T17:02:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: do we
2014-11-12T17:02:22 <Bosmon7> Even if this were a reasonable architectual approach
2014-11-12T17:02:29 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - don\'t we still support IE9?
2014-11-12T17:02:32 <Justin_o> i think we only support modern browsers now and they all should have at least partial support
2014-11-12T17:02:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: nope
2014-11-12T17:02:41 <Bosmon7> wow
2014-11-12T17:02:42 <Bosmon7> ok
2014-11-12T17:02:52 <Bosmon7> how futuristic : P
2014-11-12T17:02:53 <Justin_o> latest IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox
2014-11-12T17:02:55 <Justin_o> :)
2014-11-12T17:03:06 <Justin_o> so life building the framework should be a bit easier
2014-11-12T17:03:10 <Justin_o> and styling things too :)
2014-11-12T17:03:16 <Bosmon7> Yes
2014-11-12T17:03:39 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - so yes, your test fixtures should accept any event that occurs +/- 50ms of the expected time as being in range
2014-11-12T17:04:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: that\'s a pretty big window if i want to test that queues are working properly\'
2014-11-12T17:04:14 <Justin_o> the tests are going to take a long time to run
2014-11-12T17:04:17 <Bosmon7> Given I believe the real minimum precision of setTimeout is about 13ms, that should give us some margin for saftey
2014-11-12T17:04:22 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes, they will end up being a bit slow
2014-11-12T17:04:46 <Bosmon7> But still, CachingTests.js aren\'t even our slowest... or even our least reliable tests : P
2014-11-12T17:04:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :)
2014-11-12T17:05:13 <Bosmon7> I think the accolade for the first goes to the ImageReorderer tests
2014-11-12T17:05:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m going to have to economize on the number of items i queue
2014-11-12T17:05:29 <Bosmon7> And for the latter, to anything run with the IoC Testing Framework
2014-11-12T17:05:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yah.. that\'s super slow.. but pretty good on the new browsers... not like when we were running it on IE 6
2014-11-12T17:05:48 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes, I think a set of 3 requests per fixture should be adequate
