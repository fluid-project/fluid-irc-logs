2014-06-18T17:27:14 <jhung> Hi simonjb - Justin_o told me that you might have some time to take a look at the Fluid website docpad implementation? In particular we need help getting Handlebars working with Docpad.
2014-06-18T17:35:01 <simonjb> jhung: yes, I can definitely take a look and see if I can help
2014-06-18T17:36:53 <jhung> Great simonjb. I have pushed up my work in progress to my FLUID-5451 branch. https://github.com/jhung/fluidproject.org/tree/FLUID-5451
2014-06-18T17:37:44 <jhung> It\'s a docpad directory. So you should be able to do \'docpad run\' and it will build the output.
2014-06-18T17:38:11 <jhung> When you want, we can synch up on Skype and I can fill you in on what has been done so far.
