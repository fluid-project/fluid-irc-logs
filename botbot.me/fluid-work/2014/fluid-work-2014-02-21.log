2014-02-21T16:50:16 <amilchev> bye for now and thanks for the time
2014-02-21T16:50:18 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'ll take a look..

2014-02-21T16:51:44 <amilchev> Justin_o: I had planned to update this and the one with the save button (getting the token from http://127.0.0.1:8081/token)
2014-02-21T16:52:16 <amilchev> Justin_o: but never managed to fix this in the first place
2014-02-21T16:53:05 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. i\'ll see what i can do.. if you do get around to doing more work later, please let me and kasper know.
2014-02-21T16:54:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok, thank you for helping - this week i\'ve been unable to be in the office for more than 8 hours total...
2014-02-21T16:56:35 <Justin_o> amilchev: np... you didn\'t have much time eh... thanks for checking in with me today

2014-02-21T17:44:23 <sgithens> hey michelled
2014-02-21T17:45:22 <michelled> hey there, kasparnet and I were going through things that need to be in for the pilots and we came across a pull request that I think is on your plate
2014-02-21T17:45:43 <michelled> any chance you\'d be able to take a look at this sgithens? https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/43
2014-02-21T17:46:35 <sgithens> michelled: Yeah, this weekend
2014-02-21T17:47:21 <sgithens> Heading to Boulder for the weekend and will be hacking on GPII long days both days
2014-02-21T17:48:04 <michelled> ah, great! give CATTT a hug from me :)

2014-02-21T17:55:59 <sgithens> michelled: Does it actually need to be merged by Monday for the pilot?  I mean if there are comments and things.
2014-02-21T17:57:56 <michelled> It\'s possible that end to end testing on linux could wait until Tuesday if it had to
2014-02-21T17:58:17 <michelled> certainly we don\'t want to push things to master if they aren\'t ready
2014-02-21T17:59:14 <sgithens> michelled:  I think it works, just looking through it, there are some pythonic things.  Assuming it works Ok, I\'ll go ahead and merge it and just make another pull for Javi with the cosmetics
2014-02-21T17:59:35 <sgithens> ie. new style classes inherit from object, etc etc
2014-02-21T18:00:01 <michelled> sounds good sgithens - thanks

2014-02-21T19:35:58 <Bosmon2> Hi simonjb - I\'ll be here this time - in the meantime I wanted to point to the stub of my mini-whitepaper on BEING AND TIME that I managed to get through a bit of last night after everyone stopped bothering me about their emergencies :)

2014-02-21T19:36:46 <simonjb> Bosmon2: I\'ll take a look
2014-02-21T19:37:16 <Bosmon2> I plan to finish off this section by talking about the instantiation process, and then there will be another section on the BANKRUPTCY OF LISKOVIANISM
2014-02-21T19:43:24 <colinclark> When did Bosmon2 get so Heideggerian?
2014-02-21T20:02:05 <sgithens> Bosmon2 : Are you summoning Dogen?
2014-02-21T20:12:21 <Bosmon2> Ok back now!
2014-02-21T20:14:38 <Bosmon2> Oh dear, I had thought it was Kant rather than Heidegger : P
2014-02-21T20:14:45 <Bosmon2> I\'d better rename it slightly ....

2014-02-21T13:34:14 <amilchev> hi Justin_o
2014-02-21T13:34:26 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello, how are things going?
2014-02-21T13:34:40 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-02-21T13:35:29 <amilchev> Justin_o, I had to spend almost all the week out of office, so it\'s quite busy today... I\'ve got a question on your comment here https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/27
2014-02-21T13:35:48 <amilchev> about the {gpiiStore}.set invoker
2014-02-21T13:35:59 * yzen has quit
2014-02-21T13:36:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: sure.. it didn\'t seem to be saving anything to the preferences server at the time. I assumed it should, but feel free to correct me if I\'m wrong. Or maybe it just wasn\'t working at the time.
2014-02-21T13:39:11 <amilchev> Justin_o: well it seems that the invoker is indeed called but the first argument "model" isn\'t the model exactly...
2014-02-21T13:40:45 <amilchev> Justin_o: do you have any idea why? Since the invoker declares its own arguments (and is dynamic as well)
2014-02-21T13:41:06 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. what are you getting for the model?
2014-02-21T13:42:16 <amilchev> Justin_o: just an object containing nothing else but its __proto__ object ..
2014-02-21T13:42:45 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. first question, is your branch up-to-date with master?
2014-02-21T13:45:17 <amilchev> Justin_o: no, it\'s not, wait for me to catch up with master
2014-02-21T13:46:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay, let me know when you have that updated because it could have been an issue that is fixed there
2014-02-21T13:46:41 <amilchev> sure
2014-02-21T13:57:58 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok, now model is has many fields like (altKey, attrChange, attrName, bubbles) but none of them is the model.. and var transformedModel = modelTransformFunc(model); respectively means that transformedModel is an empty object
2014-02-21T13:58:44 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'ll try updating again. I was using yours just now, and was getting a model back. however, when it went to save, it was using a different token
2014-02-21T13:59:56 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, did you update your gpii servers by clearing out the node_modules directory and rebuilding it
2014-02-21T14:00:53 <amilchev> Justin_o: I was testing on Linux (without servers running) just to check if the set function is called and a model is passed
2014-02-21T14:01:07 <amilchev> Justin_o: i\'ll check on windows vm with servers running now..
2014-02-21T14:01:15 <Justin_o> amilchev: cool thanks
2014-02-21T14:01:35 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, did you push up your changes after merging with master?
2014-02-21T14:02:06 <amilchev> Justin_o, no, not yet
2014-02-21T14:02:20 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you could do that, i can try to test it here too
2014-02-21T14:02:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok, just a second
2014-02-21T14:10:21 <Justin_o> kasparne_: hello, are you there.. had some questions about gpii pull requests for you
2014-02-21T14:13:22 <amilchev> Justin_o I\'ve pushed in gpii-549 branch of mine
2014-02-21T14:13:36 <Justin_o> amilchev: thanks
2014-02-21T14:14:58 <kasparne_> heya Justin_o
2014-02-21T14:15:50 <Justin_o> kasparne_: hello... so wondering about deadlines.. when do things need to be in?
2014-02-21T14:16:32 <Justin_o> when do you want to be doing the merging?
2014-02-21T14:18:29 <kasparne_> well - I have to be somewhere at 19:00 tonight (ie. 3 1/2 hours from now)
2014-02-21T14:18:37 <kasparne_> so before then, I can easily do the merging
2014-02-21T14:18:49 <kasparne_> but I can do that as well over the weekend
2014-02-21T14:18:59 <kasparne_> as long as I have the green ligth from you, it\'s not much work to merge
2014-02-21T14:19:01 <kasparne_> Justin_o: ^
2014-02-21T14:19:04 * clown joined the channel
2014-02-21T14:19:37 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay... and you want to have all the pulls merged in before you start on monday?
2014-02-21T14:20:19 <kasparne_> Justin_o: that would definitely be preferable
2014-02-21T14:20:39 <kasparne_> Justin_o: but most important is the basic functionality ones
2014-02-21T14:20:57 * clown has left the channel
2014-02-21T14:21:01 * clown joined the channel
2014-02-21T14:21:01 <kasparne_> because we want the pilot tests to be able to go through the scenarios, etc
2014-02-21T14:21:10 * yzen joined the channel
2014-02-21T14:21:29 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay. so i\'m looking at this one https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/31
2014-02-21T14:21:31 <kasparne_> whereas they can start on that without having all the keyboard navigation related issues fixed
2014-02-21T14:22:19 <Justin_o> it seems to be working functionally but has introduced some styling issues... granted the styling probably wasn\'t completely accurate before either, but this is a bit worse.. it\'s not horrible though..
2014-02-21T14:22:30 <Justin_o> i\'ll put up a screen shot on the pull so you can see
2014-02-21T14:24:06 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay.. i see what you are saying. We are probably in tough to get GPII-600 done.. the issues are trickier that i had first thought
2014-02-21T14:25:12 <kasparne_> Justin_o: ok - prioritize the reviews, and if GPII-600 doesn\'t make it in until monday (or even tuesday) we\'ll be ok
2014-02-21T14:25:30 <Justin_o> kasparne_: okay thanks...

2014-02-21T14:38:56 <Justin_o> amilchev: so i was testing the wrong thing there, the save and apply instead of the full editor button. I can see the error you are getting now. The reason is that you are passing along the event object instead of the model. You can see from the invoker that the first argument is passed in when you call the invoker. This should be the model, but since this
2014-02-21T14:38:56 <Justin_o> is being triggered off of a jQuery DOM event, you are getting the event object instead of the model passed along
2014-02-21T14:43:08 <amilchev> Justin_o: but why is the event object passed instead of the model?
2014-02-21T14:45:05 <Justin_o> amilchev: simply put, it\'s because that\'s what you\'ve passed in.  So if you look at your configuration to trigger {gpiiStore}.set https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-549/src/shared/adjusters/js/prefsEditor.js#L47-L51
2014-02-21T14:45:39 <Justin_o> you see that on click binds set as a handler.. by default these jQuery events pass along the event object as an argument to the handler
2014-02-21T14:46:14 <amilchev> Justin_o: oh..
2014-02-21T14:46:32 <Justin_o> amilchev: and looking at the set invoker we see that the first argument is used for the model https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-549/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L177-L181
2014-02-21T14:47:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: yeah, i know that the first arg should be the model ..
2014-02-21T14:47:30 <amilchev> Justin_o: I thought that calling the invoker will make the invoker determine its own arguments as specified in GPIIStore.js
2014-02-21T14:48:21 <Justin_o> amilchev: you could do that, but because set uses {arguments}.0 its taking a value from the arguments passed in
2014-02-21T14:48:31 * colinclark joined the channel
2014-02-21T14:49:02 <amilchev> Justin_o: mhm..so how should I work around this
2014-02-21T14:53:05 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XBN9mUJ1
2014-02-21T14:53:32 <Justin_o> amilchev: see if creating the invoker i declaration i just pasted in would work
2014-02-21T14:53:42 <Justin_o> then you could use that invoker as your click handler
2014-02-21T14:55:08 <amilchev> Justin_o: got it, let me see..

2014-02-21T15:44:15 <Justin_o> cindyli:  fluid.allocateGuid
2014-02-21T15:44:28 <cindyli> nice. thanks, Justin_o

2014-02-21T15:45:24 <cindyli> great. thanks, Justin_o
2014-02-21T15:47:43 <amilchev> Justin_o: "{gpiiStore}.set" in the invoker declaration failed to call the function, tried to see why
2014-02-21T15:48:10 <amilchev> I mean funcName: "{gpiiStore}.set"
2014-02-21T15:49:26 <Justin_o> amilchev: use "func" instead of "funcName"
2014-02-21T15:51:13 <amilchev> Justin_o: I used "func" with no success and changed it to funcName (same result)
2014-02-21T15:53:29 <amilchev> Justin_o: tried declaratively calling // "funcName": "gpii.prefs.gpiiStore.set", function was called with the model alright
2014-02-21T15:56:31 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. that should work since it\'s a global function, but you may want to be careful in that if someone were to switch what is used by the store, you would be using something different
2014-02-21T15:57:04 <Justin_o> amilchev: what was the error you were getting when you tried using {gpiiStore}.set in the invoker?
2014-02-21T15:59:20 <Justin_o> amilchev: is gpiiStore a grade that is used by the prefsEditor, if so you might just be able to use {that}.set
2014-02-21T16:00:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: didn\'t get any error, i just put breakpoints in the set function and didn\'t reach them
2014-02-21T16:00:51 <amilchev> let me try
2014-02-21T16:02:25 <amilchev> no, {that}.set didn\'t work
2014-02-21T16:05:45 <amilchev> Justin_o:  https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-549/src/shared/adjusters/js/prefsEditor.js#L50 this call seemed to be working passed like this, I wonder why "func": "{gpiiStore}.set" doesn\'t
2014-02-21T16:05:58 <amilchev> let me check any typos...
2014-02-21T16:10:26 <amilchev> Justin_o: removing the "args" part of https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XBN9mUJ1 called the function
2014-02-21T16:12:58 <amilchev> any idea how to achieve both parts..?
2014-02-21T16:22:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: i would have thought it would work.. let me take another look
2014-02-21T16:28:10 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m getting a 500 error now when trying to load the PCP from PMT. Do you get that?
2014-02-21T16:30:03 <amilchev> Justin_o: you mean transition when pressing "Go to PCP" button?
2014-02-21T16:30:14 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes
2014-02-21T16:30:22 <amilchev> Justin_o: because that just opens http://localhost:8003/pcp.html?null to e
2014-02-21T16:30:23 <Justin_o> it had been working earlier for me..
2014-02-21T16:30:32 <amilchev> to me*
2014-02-21T16:30:43 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you create a user first it will put the user token in
2014-02-21T16:30:50 <Justin_o> create with PMT that is
2014-02-21T16:32:43 <amilchev> Justin_o: here\'s what I do: open PMT, click "save and apply", then a user is generated and the token shown, https://smarthouse-dev.remex.hdm-stuttgart.de/?token=45e309a2-5234-4f8c-b765-0e35d788eb36 is opened (you see the token)
2014-02-21T16:33:09 <amilchev> I see in universal/testData/preferences the new user
2014-02-21T16:33:30 <amilchev> and when clicking on "go to pcp" - http://localhost:8003/pcp.html?null
2014-02-21T16:40:17 * colinclark has quit
2014-02-21T16:42:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: really.. i\'m surprised.. if you aren\'t getting the dialog with the token in it, it probably means that you didn\'t update universal
2014-02-21T16:44:10 <Justin_o> amilchev: right now i\'m getting the error on this call fluid.generateUniquePrefix
2014-02-21T16:44:12 <Justin_o> oops
