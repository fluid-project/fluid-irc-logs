2014-08-15T21:04:04 <Bosmon> Thanks for all of your hard work polishing this component
2014-08-15T21:04:13 * jhung has quit
2014-08-15T21:04:14 <Bosmon> And working on all these promising bits of "microframework"
2014-08-15T21:04:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem, thank you for the quick and thorough review
2014-08-15T21:04:42 <Bosmon> It\'s hard to push on both the goals of making real stuff quickly, as well as preparing for the future, but I think we are managing it
2014-08-15T21:05:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: glad to help where I can.. it\'s good to see that we are making progress to the ideal world :)
2014-08-15T21:05:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m heading out now.. see you in a week
2014-08-15T21:05:27 <Bosmon> cheers - have a great vacation!

2014-08-15T12:52:27 <Bosmon> great BLOGG posting, the-t-in-rtf
2014-08-15T12:52:37 <Bosmon> Do we have any ability to define custom analyzers in this configuration?
2014-08-15T12:52:44 <Bosmon> or is this still only possible by writing Java code?
2014-08-15T12:57:01 <the-t-in-rtf> Sadly it is Java beyond the couch proxy.
2014-08-15T12:57:45 <the-t-in-rtf> If you\'re not on the architecture list and are curious, we\'re talking about this:  http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/couch-lucene.html

2014-08-15T14:27:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can i get your advice.. I have a function that takes in a  a path, index, and root for the model and internally fires a change request using that combination such as root + index + path
2014-08-15T14:27:25 <Justin_o> the path can be either a string or an array
2014-08-15T14:27:39 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Sa8xxAUk
2014-08-15T14:27:43 <Justin_o> that\'s the function
2014-08-15T14:28:02 <Justin_o> but i realized that i may run into errors if someone passes in a path like "a.b"
2014-08-15T14:28:11 <Justin_o> since it will be treated as a single segment
2014-08-15T14:30:09 <Bosmon> yes
2014-08-15T14:30:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have a recommendation for how to do this better?
2014-08-15T14:30:39 <Bosmon> You should parse the path out into segments first
2014-08-15T14:30:47 <Bosmon> If it is not an array
2014-08-15T14:31:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. so check if it\'s a string and split on "."
2014-08-15T14:31:44 <Justin_o> and otherwise assume it\'s an array?
2014-08-15T14:32:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does this seem reasonable?
2014-08-15T14:32:37 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/nWv7WzKk
2014-08-15T14:32:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think you are safe enough to use the method that.applier.parseEL
2014-08-15T14:32:53 <Bosmon> We should probably elevate this to the status of an API
2014-08-15T14:32:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh .. i haven\'t seen that before
2014-08-15T14:33:15 <Bosmon> There used to be a bunch of different scrappy methods to do this around the place
2014-08-15T14:33:24 <Bosmon> But during the new ChangeApplier work they all got centralised in one place
2014-08-15T14:34:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what is the return type of that.applier.parseEL is it an array?
2014-08-15T14:34:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2014-08-15T15:06:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - remind me - have we dropped support for IE8?
2014-08-15T15:06:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. we only support IE 11 now
2014-08-15T15:06:49 <Bosmon> oh amzing
2014-08-15T15:06:52 <Bosmon> That\'s great news
2014-08-15T15:07:00 <Bosmon> I was just busy adding an IE browser detect to one of our core files : P
2014-08-15T15:14:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes please don\'t add those :)
2014-08-15T15:14:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, check out microsofts new policy... it\'s still a couple years out, but it fits in line with our thinking http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/08/07/stay-up-to-date-with-internet-explorer.aspx
2014-08-15T15:14:44 * michelled joined the channel
2014-08-15T15:14:50 <Bosmon> It\'s interesting that the utility Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor is broken on IE8 in a way which makes a mockery of feature detection
2014-08-15T15:15:16 <Bosmon> The function exists and does execute, but it works only on objects which came from the DOM.... and throws an exception on other objects
2014-08-15T15:16:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s strange

2014-08-15T16:45:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone used "cheerio" to do server-side jQuery?
2014-08-15T16:46:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to write a handlebars helper that is aware of the markup it\'s working with, which requires something like jQuery that can turn a dom into silly putty.
2014-08-15T16:54:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I don\'t think that\'s a great idea
2014-08-15T16:55:04 <Bosmon> Our experiments with server-side jquery were unrewarding
2014-08-15T16:55:12 <Bosmon> Do you think you could explain your use case?
2014-08-15T16:55:22 <Bosmon> All that should really happen on the server is template generation using handlebars
2014-08-15T16:56:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I am seeing if I can add the equivalent of "selected=true" to the option that is selected based on an object the server is already aware of.
2014-08-15T16:56:21 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - best to do all detailed transformation like that on the client
2014-08-15T16:56:29 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I am getting that sense.
2014-08-15T16:56:37 <Bosmon> Just try to get the markup correct "in bulk" on the server
2014-08-15T16:56:49 <Bosmon> And deal with any such fine tuning once you get it under your hands
2014-08-15T17:00:54 <the-t-in-rtf> That makes perfect sense in this case, but I also have session variables like the authenticated user.  I suppose I can dump those as arguments to a function in the markup generated by the template.  Is that insane?  I mean if the server is already aware of the data, it would be nice to save a client call and just pass in the data I already know about.
2014-08-15T17:23:11 * slim__ has quit
2014-08-15T17:23:41 <Bosmon> Well, this is a familiar sort of problem
2014-08-15T17:24:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you have an example of a familiar sort of solution?\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2014-08-15T17:24:13 <Bosmon> Your best option is to write a function block at the bottom of the markup, putting "well-known data" of this kind into a suitably namespaced global variable as a compound JSON object
2014-08-15T17:24:16 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-08-15T17:24:32 <Bosmon> This is the kind of solution we have been propagating since about 2006
2014-08-15T17:24:48 <Bosmon> You may remember the existence of "init blocks" in "Ye Olde RSF" : P
2014-08-15T17:25:31 <the-t-in-rtf> That was exactly what I was planning to do before I had this flight of fancy on the server side, glad I am not in terribly shameful company in thinking of this approach.
2014-08-15T17:26:14 <Bosmon> no shame in writing JSON data into the end of your markup at all : P
2014-08-15T17:26:20 <Bosmon> All the cool kids are doing it : P
2014-08-15T17:26:23 <Bosmon> And worse .......
2014-08-15T17:26:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, I dislike that you cannot have something rendered and cached across users, but it is a small price to pay when the overall process is so fast.
2014-08-15T17:26:58 <Bosmon> You should see what Google writes into the markup of their homepage some time : P
2014-08-15T17:27:24 <Bosmon> Well, you have to pay the costs somewhere
2014-08-15T17:27:36 <Bosmon> You can\'t both simultaneously load the page in a single request, AND have it cached
2014-08-15T17:28:08 <Bosmon> Somewhere in the middle there is a compromise, but where exactly that lies takes a huge amount of experience of the production context
2014-08-15T17:28:30 <Bosmon> Right now it is best to "do something reasonable that doesn\'t take you too long" and we can sweat it out when a high-volume production situation arises : P
2014-08-15T17:28:33 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I was thinking more of the advantage if I went all client side and did the extra user info lookup
2014-08-15T17:28:49 <the-t-in-rtf> but yes, "doesn\'t take you too long" is definitely the order of the day

2014-08-15T20:52:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks great
2014-08-15T20:52:16 <Bosmon> I\'m really sorry to keep you late before your holiday!

2014-08-15T20:52:26 <Bosmon> Other than rewording the comment, I think it looks good to go!
2014-08-15T20:54:16 <Bosmon> I think documenting the requirements of "unbound grades" is a really interesting issue
2014-08-15T20:54:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool.. i\'ll do that now
2014-08-15T20:54:24 <Bosmon> I remember the days when we used to recommend never creating them at all
2014-08-15T20:54:38 <Bosmon> But they are actually turning out to be one of the more helpful capabilities of the framework
2014-08-15T20:57:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m looking at your comment.. is the last point important to document.. since it should already be a viewComponent based on its gradeNames
2014-08-15T20:57:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I meant to say that it assumes that the grade it binds on to is a viewComponent
2014-08-15T20:58:08 <Bosmon> That is, the component matched by {tooltipHolder}
2014-08-15T20:58:29 <Bosmon> All of these are requirements on the "binding grade" .....
2014-08-15T20:59:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so "it" in points ii) and iii) refer to that grade
2014-08-15T20:59:36 * yzen has quit
2014-08-15T20:59:49 <Bosmon> That is, the one named in i)
2014-08-15T20:59:58 <Bosmon> I\'m sure you can word this so that it is clearer than my version :)
2014-08-15T21:00:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ll try but i\'m not the master of the english language that you are :)
