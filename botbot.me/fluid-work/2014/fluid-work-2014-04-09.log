2014-04-09T18:39:58 <jhung> Bosmon - the -30em is for a transition effect (moves in and out 30em) and therefore cosmetic in nature. The display:hidden is the real important piece which is to visually hide the content and prevent it from being interacted with by ATs or otherwise.
2014-04-09T18:42:08 <jhung> ^sorry that may be a display:none, or visibility: hidden property in CSS. I don\'t recall which one was used. Either way the intent and effect is the same.

2014-04-09T19:47:01 <GSoCer> karan10: Are you a mentor?
2014-04-09T19:47:22 <karan10> GSoCer: No
2014-04-09T19:47:49 <GSoCer> karan10: Are you a student for GSoC?
2014-04-09T19:48:10 <karan10> GSoCer: Yes.
2014-04-09T19:48:46 <GSoCer> karan10: I want to do GSoC. Can you help me?
2014-04-09T19:49:24 <GSoCer> Google says that I can\'t participate now! But I want to participate. What can I do?
2014-04-09T19:50:20 <karan10> GSoCer : Yes, the student application period has been over. You may participate next year.
2014-04-09T19:50:46 <karan10> I suggest you to go through previous years projects.
2014-04-09T19:51:00 <GSoCer> Can I do project without being under GSoC?

2014-04-09T19:52:37 <karan10> GSoCer : If you want to contribute to the organization you can use the products and get familiar with them. You can find the source code on Github. Just find issues and try to solve them.
2014-04-09T19:53:31 <GSoCer> karan10: Thank you! You are so helpfull! :)
2014-04-09T19:54:17 <GSoCer> *helpful
2014-04-09T19:54:58 <karan10> GSoCer: your welcome! here it is "https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion"
2014-04-09T19:56:52 <GSoCer> One of the things I found weird is there is no one present on #atutor ! Why do they write IRC address if there is no one? :\\ . I waited for them to come at their time(According to timezone). And still no one was there. That\'s why I missed my deadline for GSoC :(
2014-04-09T19:59:25 <GSoCer> karan10: Is there any mentor?
2014-04-09T20:01:47 <GSoCer> Any mentor? I am very good at PHP, C++, Java, CSS, HTML, C#, Javascript! :)
2014-04-09T20:02:10 <Justin_o> karan10: hello
2014-04-09T20:03:51 <Justin_o> GSoCer: karan10 is right about this year\'s GSoC. Those rules are set up by Google and not the individual organizations.
2014-04-09T20:06:29 <GSoCer> Justin_o: ok yo!
2014-04-09T20:09:15 <GSoCer> I want to contribute outside GSoC. Can some one give me bugs/errors/tasks/challenge to solve? :)

2014-04-09T20:17:16 <Justin_o> GSoCer: you can check in with cindyli or greggy2 about any aTutor related questions
2014-04-09T20:18:26 <cindyli> GSoCer: ATutor bug tracker - http://atutor.ca/atutor/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php
2014-04-09T20:19:19 <GSoCer> Justin_o, cindyli:  Cool, Thanks! I will start solving a lot of bugs from now!
2014-04-09T20:19:32 <cindyli> thanks, GSoCer
2014-04-09T20:20:13 <Justin_o> GSoCer: for fluid work you might also want to look at http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards and http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Contributing+Code
2014-04-09T20:21:18 <karan10> Justin_o : If image of word is not present in the image database, can we include more than one image database platforms that have creative common images to get the images for all possible searches ?
2014-04-09T20:22:29 <Justin_o> karan10: for sure

2014-04-09T20:25:01 <karan10> Justin_o: ok, But still I am in confusion for the better solution of words with different meanings ?
2014-04-09T20:27:28 <Justin_o> vjoanna: did you have thoughts on this? I\'m thinking that you would show multiple images. We\'d probably still want to include text descriptions some how along side or as alternative text.

2014-04-09T16:40:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for the responses re the linting
2014-04-09T16:40:47 * avtar joined the channel
2014-04-09T16:41:19 <Bosmon> Is there some way we can put more comment material on the same line as a one-line jshint ignore directive without confusing it?
2014-04-09T16:41:47 <Bosmon> Most of my comments on the one-liners were asking for explanation to appear in the file rather than just in the pull request
2014-04-09T16:42:08 <Bosmon> But just a single word or couple of words would be fine, if we can squeeze it in somehow
2014-04-09T16:42:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i don\'t see a way to do this unfortunately.. i can comment on a different line. That\'s about the only way i see at the moment
2014-04-09T16:43:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so it gets confused if there is any other material either before or after the jshint section in the same comment?
2014-04-09T16:43:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, i\'ve finished making changes to the rest of your comments now.. so it\'s completely open for another round of review
2014-04-09T16:43:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ll try before and see what happens, but yes for afterwards
2014-04-09T16:45:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, before or after on the same line confuses it
2014-04-09T16:46:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s awful
2014-04-09T16:47:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you can do something like this /* capital letter */ // jshint ignore:line
2014-04-09T16:47:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - great
2014-04-09T16:47:27 <Bosmon> That will, do, I think?
2014-04-09T16:47:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: was it just for those "Capital Letter" annotations or were there others too
2014-04-09T16:47:47 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2014-04-09T16:47:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there were several others, I think
2014-04-09T16:48:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you comment on them?
2014-04-09T16:48:21 <Justin_o> or do you mean wherever there was a jshint ignore:line?
2014-04-09T16:50:51 <jhung> cindyli: Can the metadata data panel be nested inside the simple editor container?
2014-04-09T16:51:11 <cindyli> jhung: better not to
2014-04-09T16:52:48 <jhung> cindyli: thanks
2014-04-09T16:53:03 <cindyli> thank YOU, jhung :)
2014-04-09T16:53:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I added comments for the ones you mentioned in the pull request
2014-04-09T17:03:15 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2014-04-09T17:03:42 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o - I\'ll go through later today for another pass

2014-04-09T17:32:56 <anastasiac> what do you need updated?
2014-04-09T17:33:05 <michelled> anastasiac: http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/download-infusion/
2014-04-09T17:33:39 <michelled> can you switch the link to the infusion builder to a link to the actual bundle?
2014-04-09T17:34:15 <michelled> there are links to built versions here: http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/download-infusion/infusion-archives/
2014-04-09T17:34:26 <michelled> colinclark: were there other changes you wanted to that page?
2014-04-09T17:34:30 <anastasiac> ah, that answers the question I was typing :-)
2014-04-09T17:34:41 <anastasiac> yes, I can replace that link, no problem
2014-04-09T17:34:58 <michelled> I suppose that whole section about building has to go :)
2014-04-09T17:35:02 <michelled> since the builder is gone
2014-04-09T17:35:14 <colinclark> yes, ditch anything related to the Builder
2014-04-09T17:35:20 <anastasiac> yeah, I was planning to clena that up
2014-04-09T17:35:22 <colinclark> a prominent link to downloading the zip file
2014-04-09T17:35:31 <colinclark> and maybe less \xe2\x80\x9cSVN-ism\xe2\x80\x9d related to the source code
2014-04-09T17:35:50 <colinclark> i.e. just a prominent link to Github
2014-04-09T17:35:54 <colinclark> does that make sense?
2014-04-09T17:36:13 <anastasiac> sounds good. I\'ll ping you when it\'s updated, and you can review

2014-04-09T17:42:29 <colinclark> thanks
2014-04-09T17:42:54 <colinclark> oh, can you ditch the broken link to the Contributor Gallery
2014-04-09T17:42:58 <colinclark> ?
2014-04-09T17:43:17 <anastasiac> ah, good catch, colinclark, I missed that.

2014-04-09T17:56:19 <jhung> cindyli: I pushed up a very early version of the restructured resource editor. The styling is all broken, but the containers should be the way we need it.

2014-04-09T18:17:48 <Bosmon> simonjb - one thing occurs looking at the overviewPanel relating to the scheme it uses for showing and hiding
2014-04-09T18:18:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: yep...
2014-04-09T18:18:24 <Bosmon> Although I guess this is really a wider community issue and could be traced back to our loss of FSS
2014-04-09T18:19:06 <Bosmon> So I guess there are two things, really - firstly, it uses a scheme which is localised to this component - that is, it is a style rule that is in its own CSS
2014-04-09T18:19:19 <Bosmon> And secondly, the particular rule we have uses CSS positioning to move the element offscreen
2014-04-09T18:19:26 <Bosmon> I\'m wondering two things relative to these two things :)
2014-04-09T18:20:17 <Bosmon> Firstly, whether i) we should have a community-wide standard for suppressing display of elements, and whether ii) this particular style plays well with screenreaders - in that, will it actually suppress navigation to the component
2014-04-09T18:20:25 <Bosmon> Ah, I see we have two styles, sorry
2014-04-09T18:20:43 <Bosmon> We have a relative position of -30em in one case, and a visibility: hidden in another
2014-04-09T18:21:28 <Bosmon> I\'m wondering what happens if we just punt this issue to jQuery and ask it to issue a $.hide() on the relevant element(s) - are the results acceptable?
