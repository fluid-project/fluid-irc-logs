b'2014-12-10T22:58:05 <avtar> it\'s going well
2014-12-10T22:58:20 <avtar> except when i try to run windows acceptance tests
2014-12-10T22:58:34 <Bosmon> oh dear
2014-12-10T22:58:37 <avtar> well
2014-12-10T22:58:59 <avtar> it could just be me and i\'m about to post to gpii-arch but thought i would check who was hanging out in the channel first
2014-12-10T22:59:17 <Bosmon> And what result do you get?
2014-12-10T23:00:01 <avtar> this is where one of the tests is b0rking https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json#L15 with 20:38:07.059:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: ENOENT, no such file or directory \'C:\\Users\\GPIITestUser\\AppData\\Roaming\\Freedom Scientific\\JAWS\\15.0\\Settings\\VoiceProfiles.ini\'
2014-12-10T23:00:11 <avtar> full output http://pastie.org/pastes/9773151/text
2014-12-10T23:00:15 <Bosmon> Ah well
2014-12-10T23:00:19 <Bosmon> that one is for KASPARNETT
2014-12-10T23:00:24 <Bosmon> He wrote the JAWS integration :)
2014-12-10T23:00:38 <Bosmon> I assume it\'s true that the profile doesn\'t exist
2014-12-10T23:00:41 <Bosmon> Is JAWS installed on the system?
2014-12-10T23:01:28 <avtar> absolutely not :/
2014-12-10T23:01:50 <Bosmon> Well then, I can only assume that the instructions for running the acceptance tests are faulty...
2014-12-10T23:01:50 <avtar> but i assumed that this was getting mocked
2014-12-10T23:01:56 <avtar> ok
2014-12-10T23:02:03 <Bosmon> No mocks in acceptance tests
2014-12-10T23:02:06 <Bosmon> it is their job to run for real
2014-12-10T23:02:15 <Bosmon> It is integration tests which have mocks
2014-12-10T23:02:20 <Bosmon> And they run from the universal repo
2014-12-10T23:02:34 <avtar> so here\'s the issue
2014-12-10T23:03:11 <avtar> i would like to run these tests on windows VMs with jenkins
2014-12-10T23:04:48 <avtar> i don\'t think simon installed any third party software on his previous vm besides just enough pieces like nodejs, npm, etc to meet gpii framework requirements
2014-12-10T23:05:05 <Bosmon> Well sure
2014-12-10T23:05:16 <Bosmon> But it is the job of the acceptance tests to test actual solutions
2014-12-10T23:05:37 <Bosmon> For example, I assume nvda is installed on the system?
2014-12-10T23:06:17 <Bosmon> Otherwise those tests would not run either
2014-12-10T23:06:52 * jessm has quit
2014-12-10T23:07:22 <avtar> no, no other third party software is installed
2014-12-10T23:08:06 <Bosmon> ok
2014-12-10T23:08:40 <avtar> i guess my question is how valuable are these test results if only windows specific features are being tested
2014-12-10T23:08:54 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure I can understand your question :)
2014-12-10T23:08:57 <Bosmon> Can you restate it?
2014-12-10T23:09:05 <avtar> i can always try :|
2014-12-10T23:12:45 <Bosmon> Well
2014-12-10T23:12:52 <Bosmon> 100% of the value of these tests is to test windows specific features
2014-12-10T23:12:57 <Bosmon> That is what they were designed for
2014-12-10T23:12:59 <Bosmon> Does that help? : P
2014-12-10T23:13:55 <avtar> yes, and how much of a requirement is it that jaws related tests are run whenever changes are made in the universal or windows repos?
2014-12-10T23:14:52 <Bosmon> Well, my first response was, "it is an absolutely essential requirement"
2014-12-10T23:15:00 <Bosmon> But clearly that is not absolutely and literally true
2014-12-10T23:15:06 <Bosmon> But still, it is the purpose these tests were written for
2014-12-10T23:15:16 <Bosmon> If it\'s more than we can manage at the moment, we will just have to disable the test
2014-12-10T23:15:32 <Bosmon> The purpose of the tests is to test that the system actually works!
2014-12-10T23:16:04 <Bosmon> And for a user who is using JAWS, that implies testing that it correctly ends up activating JAWS if that is what the user\'s preferences imply .....
2014-12-10T23:16:21 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure I\'m really helping
2014-12-10T23:16:37 <Bosmon> It\'s what you get for asking a question of a person with a heavy cold close to midnight : P
2014-12-10T23:17:10 <Bosmon> You can ask a question of KASPARNETT in the morning if you want a 2nd and no doubt much milder opinion.......
2014-12-10T23:18:04 <avtar> the coke zero version eh?
2014-12-10T23:19:05 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t coke zero still contain caffeine? : P
2014-12-10T23:19:34 <avtar> most likely but just less sugar
2014-12-10T23:19:42 <avtar> or different type of sugar
2014-12-10T23:20:15 <avtar> if i had to drink coke then i would just opt for the copious amount of sugar
2014-12-10T23:20:25 <avtar> so antranig, i choose you
2014-12-10T23:21:03 <avtar> but i\'m reading pages 4 and 5 of this document http://www.freedomscientific.com/Content/Documents/Manuals/JAWS/JAWS-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf and i have a feeling dealing with jaws licensing in the cluster isn\'t going to be straightforward
2014-12-10T23:21:10 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-12-10T23:21:19 <Bosmon> It will probably make our problems with Windows licencing look quite tame
2014-12-10T23:21:26 <avtar> agreed
2014-12-10T23:21:26 <avtar> :/
2014-12-10T23:21:35 <Bosmon> So yes, feel free to disable those tests for now
2014-12-10T23:21:42 <Bosmon> but this is an issue which we must raise AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL .....
2014-12-10T23:22:11 <Bosmon> Since obviously this issue will come up in spades and whatever other suits are relevant once we start testing the system with more and more solutions
2014-12-10T23:22:31 <Bosmon> But really it will be a requirement on our cluster that we can bring up a machine "with any relevant solution installed" up whenever we please
2014-12-10T23:22:39 <Bosmon> And presumably it will be the job of our vendors, ultimately, to assist us
2014-12-10T23:25:02 <avtar> let me try nvda this vm for now and see if at least that requirement can be met so that we have something to appease the benevolent dictators
2014-12-10T23:25:07 <Bosmon> cool
2014-12-10T23:25:16 <Bosmon> Cheers, AVTTAR
2014-12-10T23:25:30 <avtar> thanks for your help, Bosmon++
2014-12-10T23:26:02 <Bosmon> Sorry I couldn\'t be more helpful
2014-12-10T23:26:15 <Bosmon> Are you familiar with that incredible new TV show..... *******TTTOAST*******....... OF LONDON?
2014-12-10T23:26:56 <avtar> can\'t say that i am
2014-12-10T23:27:19 <Bosmon> It is from the same writer who produced Father Ted and THE IT CROWD
2014-12-10T23:29:20 <avtar> i\'ve watched a couple episodes of it crowd but never heard of father ted
2014-12-10T23:30:01 <avtar> the last british tv show that i was really into was \'the thick of it\'
2014-12-10T23:31:15 <Bosmon> Ah
2014-12-10T23:31:17 <Bosmon> A modernist : P
2014-12-10T23:33:58 <avtar> that too was only because my roommate at the time would watch it
2014-12-10T23:34:15 <avtar> i\'ve been weaning myself off media
2014-12-10T23:34:24 <avtar> or trying
2014-12-10T23:34:26 <Bosmon> media!
2014-12-10T23:35:46 <Bosmon> What if the thing played from a USB stick
2014-12-10T23:35:59 <Bosmon> Or perhaps some form of PCI-e SSD contraption?
2014-12-10T23:36:10 <Bosmon> Would be it ok to watch it then?
2014-12-10T23:36:29 <avtar> perhaps
2014-12-10T23:36:33 <avtar> but in moderation :)
2014-12-10T23:55:49 <avtar> Bosmon, kasparnet: i\'m going to vote for sticking with just the builtIn target for now
2014-12-10T23:56:27 <avtar> i can add a sound card to the vm running on the lab computer but getting the same experience on openstack isn\'t going to be as straightforward https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg20011.html
2014-12-10T23:57:18 <avtar> we don\'t have that type of direct access to the compute nodes, the cluster vendor prefers to abstract all that away

b'2014-12-10T14:47:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in that case could i just do a regular strings block and use UIVerbatim in the prototree for all of them.. it would be less secure though. but if we were going to convert all of the strings to the verbatim form anyways, i don\'t really see a difference
2014-12-10T14:48:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - presumably the idea was to allow the integrator the choice whether he wanted to have strings encoded or unencoded
2014-12-10T14:48:04 <Justin_o> i guess this is all theoretical though, since the security pages won\'t really be reused by anyone..
2014-12-10T14:48:33 <Bosmon> If every string in the bundle is interpreted as markup, we lose the ability to put simple text in there
2014-12-10T14:48:37 <Bosmon> Yes, it is largely theoretical
2014-12-10T14:48:39 <Justin_o> and i could just as easily just use my foreknowledge to select the correct type in my component
2014-12-10T14:48:53 * clown joined the channel
2014-12-10T14:49:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should i just take the simple route now, of knowing which ones need markup, or would it make more sense to start on one of these other paths now
2014-12-10T14:49:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it would be best to take the simple route now
2014-12-10T14:49:29 <Bosmon> We don\'t really have all that much time
2014-12-10T14:49:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s a very good point.. okay.. i\'ll start with the simple route for now
2014-12-10T14:50:04 <Bosmon> This discussion is logged here in IRC now for those who come after us who are interested in this requirement :)
2014-12-10T14:50:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. good to have a record and thanks for the conversation
2014-12-10T14:50:57 <Bosmon> Cheers, Justin_o

2014-12-10T15:44:59 <kasparnet> sorry for having ignored you
2014-12-10T15:45:06 <kasparnet> :)
2014-12-10T15:45:10 <kasparnet> how are things going on it
2014-12-10T15:45:22 <kasparnet> still stuck on the multi-resolve issue?
2014-12-10T15:45:35 <jhernandez> kasparnet: no prob, I\'ve been busy too
2014-12-10T15:45:41 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-12-10T15:45:59 <jhernandez> I\'ll clean up the code and share something with you
2014-12-10T15:46:05 <kasparnet> ok, cool

2014-12-10T16:35:12 <jhernandez> sorry, just did an amend
2014-12-10T16:35:31 <jhernandez> and a push -f
2014-12-10T16:35:35 * Sepideh has quit
2014-12-10T16:37:06 <Bosmon> Yes, it\'s a mess, isn\'t it, that settingsHandlers are not components....
2014-12-10T16:37:49 <Bosmon> You still have the same bug whereby two calls to "set" will end up notifying all their clients twice
2014-12-10T16:38:05 <Bosmon> Also, what if the client is not connected at the time the "set" call is received, but connects afterwards?
2014-12-10T16:38:08 <Bosmon> Then the update will be lost
2014-12-10T16:39:06 <jhernandez> yeah, the code right now is very simple
2014-12-10T16:40:26 <jhernandez> just wanted to show you a first draft, and the problem when returning the promise

2014-12-10T17:58:14 <avtar> i was wondering if you had run the windows acceptance tests recently
2014-12-10T17:58:21 <avtar> after the mega merge
2014-12-10T17:59:54 <kasparnet> yes
2014-12-10T17:59:57 <kasparnet> they all pass
2014-12-10T18:00:12 <kasparnet> though they sometimes leave windows in a limbo between high-contrast and regular theme
2014-12-10T18:00:37 <avtar> ok
2014-12-10T18:00:47 <avtar> when are you back?

2014-12-10T18:06:17 <kasparnet> avtar: I have to eat now, and then have a two hour meeting in the commune about who we our new housemate should be - so probably completely dead in the head after that

2014-12-10T09:46:15 <kasparnet> morning Bosmon
2014-12-10T11:08:28 <Bosmon> KASSPER KASSPERSSEN!
2014-12-10T11:09:12 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2014-12-10T11:32:18 <jhernandez> KASPERSKY
2014-12-10T11:32:20 <jhernandez> xDD
2014-12-10T11:59:12 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon, jhernandez: sorry was in a VM
2014-12-10T11:59:20 <kasparnet> so no pings for me
2014-12-10T11:59:39 <kasparnet> s/pings/notifications/
2014-12-10T12:00:00 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I had a question for you, but I dont really remember what it was ... so prob. not that important
2014-12-10T12:28:11 <jhernandez> kasparnet: no prob
2014-12-10T12:30:26 <jhernandez> Bosmon: kasparnet btw, I\'ve been working on the browser thing and got something (more or less) working
2014-12-10T12:33:32 <jhernandez> right now I have a bi-directional websockets channel in the flowmanager, waiting for clients
2014-12-10T12:35:08 <jhernandez> in the other side, I wrote a settings handler making use of the connected clients, getting and setting settings through signals and listeners
2014-12-10T12:36:59 <jhernandez> to test all this, I wrote a super simple client that connects to the flowmanager and waits for signals from the settings handler
2014-12-10T12:39:31 <jhernandez> although I can get and set settings in the client, when performing a login action, my get/set functions are returning before the real result of the operation arrives
2014-12-10T12:43:28 <jhernandez> Bosmon: how should I solve this problem?
2014-12-10T12:45:15 <jhernandez> a) should I wait until the result has arrived to perform the return? or b) should I return a promise of the value? c) I\'m TOTALLY WRONGG
2014-12-10T12:48:43 <kasparnet> jhernandez: that\'s awesome to hear you\'re making progress on this stuff
2014-12-10T12:49:35 <kasparnet> yeah - the way the settingshandlers are currently implemented (and bosmon can correct the stuff I got wrong :) ) is that they return a promise for the value
2014-12-10T12:50:00 <jhernandez> kasparnet: right
2014-12-10T12:51:02 <jhernandez> thanks
2014-12-10T12:51:16 * kasparnet is just looking at the code for settingshandlers
2014-12-10T12:52:24 <jhernandez> yeah, I took a look at some of them, but in my case, the problem is that my get function is as follows
2014-12-10T12:55:48 <jhernandez> function get (payload) {
2014-12-10T12:55:48 <jhernandez> // I make some operations to find the socket I\'m going to work with
2014-12-10T12:55:48 <jhernandez> // once I have the socket, I make
2014-12-10T12:55:48 <jhernandez> socket.emit("getSettings", payload)
2014-12-10T12:55:48 <jhernandez> // when the client is done, it triggers "gotSettings",
2014-12-10T12:55:51 <jhernandez> socket.on("gotSettings", function (returnPayload) {
2014-12-10T12:55:53 <jhernandez> // here I have the value to return
2014-12-10T12:55:56 <jhernandez> return returnPayload;
2014-12-10T12:55:58 <jhernandez> });
2014-12-10T12:56:01 <jhernandez> }
2014-12-10T12:56:03 <jhernandez> kasparnet: I have something like this
2014-12-10T12:59:07 <jhernandez> and at this point, I\'m not sure how to return a promise of that
2014-12-10T13:02:06 <Bosmon> jhernandez - perfectly simple
2014-12-10T13:02:15 <kasparnet> I *think* it\'s done by creating a promise (ie. before the socket.on):
2014-12-10T13:02:16 <Bosmon> Make a fluid.promise() at the start of the function
2014-12-10T13:02:26 <Bosmon> And then call "resolve" on it rather than returnPayload
2014-12-10T13:02:26 <kasparnet> ah - bosmon to the rescue
2014-12-10T13:02:29 <Bosmon> And then return the promise
2014-12-10T13:03:30 <jhernandez> that simple? right? - let me try it
2014-12-10T13:04:02 <kasparnet> Bosmon: something like this: https://code.stypi.com/kaspermarkus/promiseExample.js
2014-12-10T13:04:04 <kasparnet> ?*
2014-12-10T13:04:33 <Bosmon> Yes kasparnet - that is it
2014-12-10T13:04:38 <kasparnet> jhernandez: ^
2014-12-10T13:05:24 * jhung joined the channel
2014-12-10T13:09:02 <jhernandez> kasparnet: heh
2014-12-10T13:09:03 <jhernandez> thanks
2014-12-10T13:09:15 <jhernandez> but
2014-12-10T13:10:08 <jhernandez> I\'m having this problem
2014-12-10T13:10:09 <jhernandez> FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Object Error: resolving promise [object Object] which has received "resolve" has no method \'Assertion failure - check console for details\'
2014-12-10T13:10:19 <Bosmon> Yes well
2014-12-10T13:10:25 <Bosmon> You can only resolve it once
2014-12-10T13:10:46 <Bosmon> Obviously your communications are faulty
2014-12-10T13:11:28 <Bosmon> It has to behave like a settings handler
2014-12-10T13:11:31 <Bosmon> And produce exactly one value
2014-12-10T13:11:43 <Bosmon> Aren\'t I glad I put in that error diagnostic now!
2014-12-10T13:23:13 <jhernandez> ok, still not working
2014-12-10T13:23:18 <jhernandez> :/
2014-12-10T13:23:52 <kasparnet> is your promise.resolve function getting called multiple times?
2014-12-10T13:24:03 <jhernandez> well, not yet
2014-12-10T13:24:47 <jhernandez> right now I\'m "hardcoding" my get function in order to deal with just one element to see things working
2014-12-10T13:26:35 <jhernandez> but, even by having this, I guess that I should remove the listener after getting the result
2014-12-10T13:26:37 <kasparnet> so even resolving the promise just once gives you that error
2014-12-10T13:27:12 <jhernandez> but, if I remove the listener my promise won\'t be resolved
2014-12-10T13:27:15 <jhernandez> xD
2014-12-10T13:28:40 <kasparnet> cant you remove it immediately after resolving the promise?
2014-12-10T13:31:52 <jhernandez> nope, already tried it
2014-12-10T13:33:25 <jhernandez> kasparnet: let me update the stypi
2014-12-10T13:34:29 <jhernandez> https://code.stypi.com/kaspermarkus/promiseExample.js
2014-12-10T13:37:56 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-12-10T13:38:51 <kasparnet> jhernandez: I dont think it\'s clear to me what the current problem is... Is it that the resolving happens several times?
2014-12-10T13:39:16 <kasparnet> ie. several gotSettings messages?
2014-12-10T13:40:45 <jhernandez> if I remove the listener *looks like* it doesn\'t like it
2014-12-10T13:40:48 <jhernandez> and
2014-12-10T13:41:04 <jhernandez> id I do not remove it, *looks like* it\'s being called so many times
2014-12-10T13:42:02 <jhernandez> not sure, so let me play a little bit more with it
2014-12-10T13:47:56 <Bosmon> You probably can\'t remove the listener with the existing sockets.io API, perhaps
2014-12-10T13:48:25 <Bosmon> VVANTUNNEZZ!
2014-12-10T13:50:24 <kasparnet> jhernandez: so I know it\'s dirty, but perhaps try just using a flag
2014-12-10T13:50:30 <kasparnet> like the example in the stypi pad
2014-12-10T13:50:33 <kasparnet> (i\'ve updated it)

2014-12-10T13:52:14 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-12-10T13:55:27 <Bosmon> Yes, and what will you do with your flag when the 2nd request comes through for your settings handler?
2014-12-10T13:58:24 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-12-10T14:02:07 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well, wouldn\'t that result in a new call to the top level "get" function - ie. resetting the flag?

2014-12-10T14:09:27 * jessm joined the channel
2014-12-10T14:14:20 <Bosmon> No, you have a fundamental bug that will lead the socket to accumulate listeners
2014-12-10T14:14:26 <Bosmon> It gets an extra one every time round your loop
2014-12-10T14:16:36 * Sepideh has quit
2014-12-10T14:22:21 <kasparnet> yeah ok, good point
2014-12-10T14:22:42 <jhernandez> heh
2014-12-10T14:23:11 <jhernandez> sorry, I\'ve been afk

2014-12-10T14:27:37 <jhernandez> Bosmon: kasparnet just updated the stypi with the problem I\'m getting
2014-12-10T14:27:41 <jhernandez> (right now)
2014-12-10T14:27:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: just catching up from our conversation yesterday
2014-12-10T14:28:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think at one point you mentioned that it wasn\'t good to have markup in the strings block because it could lead to insecure implementations.. so we started putting them in markup blocks instead..
2014-12-10T14:28:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but i\'d guess that localization wouldn\'t work with the markup block
2014-12-10T14:29:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess it is a potential risk
2014-12-10T14:30:07 <Bosmon> but the attacker would already have had to get us to load a "hostile string bundle" or so
2014-12-10T14:30:17 <Bosmon> You\'d assume in that case they could probably get us to load arbitrary JS also
2014-12-10T14:30:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s possible yes
2014-12-10T14:30:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think it was that the markup block vs string block was explicit
2014-12-10T14:32:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, this may go against the previous point in some ways, we\'d need to have some for knowledge that a string contained markup since the prototree would need to be instructed to render things as verbatim instead...
2014-12-10T14:32:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, we would have to have that knowledge
2014-12-10T14:32:39 <Bosmon> But presumably the application designer would decide this up front
2014-12-10T14:32:44 * simonjb has quit
2014-12-10T14:33:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure because i know how i want mine to be styled, but the integrator should have a choice in that too
2014-12-10T14:33:41 <Justin_o> and yes, they do have the ability, but it could be very difficult depending on the complexity of the prototree, or worse, a full tree
2014-12-10T14:33:42 <Bosmon> Yes, it is a little awkward
2014-12-10T14:34:01 <Bosmon> It\'s hard to think of a way that could be achieved with the means we have at the moment
2014-12-10T14:34:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. yah.. true.. so for the moment i\'ll use the strings block with markup and verbatim rendering
2014-12-10T14:34:33 <Bosmon> One possibility is to have an "extended string bundle format"
2014-12-10T14:34:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does that mean
2014-12-10T14:34:45 <Justin_o> how would that look
2014-12-10T14:34:54 <Bosmon> Where the strings would have to include a little metadata representing whether they had been markup-encoded or not
2014-12-10T14:35:17 <Bosmon> It seems a little cumbersome, but it\'s the only kind of scheme that could accomplish this with any grace, I think
2014-12-10T14:35:44 <Bosmon> So for example rather than just having a plain string as the value, there would be a little block such as { verbatim: true, markup: "......"}
2014-12-10T14:41:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: like this?
2014-12-10T14:41:10 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/yiciHPtU
2014-12-10T14:41:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, like that
2014-12-10T14:42:04 <Justin_o> so the protoTree would take functions that returned an object representing the correct config?
2014-12-10T14:42:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, perhaps a cleaner way would be to have the protoTree just include UIVerbatim components
2014-12-10T14:42:45 <Bosmon> And then have a step of pre-processing the string bundle to upgrade every bare string to the verbatim form
2014-12-10T14:42:51 <Justin_o> for every possible string
2014-12-10T14:43:11 <Justin_o> do we have to do the upgrade
2014-12-10T14:43:20 <Justin_o> if they were all verbatim it shouldn\'t matter right
2014-12-10T14:43:30 <Justin_o> or do message keys not work in verbatim components
2014-12-10T14:44:58 <Bosmon> I believe UIMessage is supported within UIVerbatim, yes
