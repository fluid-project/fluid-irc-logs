b'2014-08-06T17:37:12 <michelled> Bosmon: would you like to update https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/pull/3/files
2014-08-06T17:37:13 <Bosmon> It\'s just 1 one-liner....
2014-08-06T17:37:27 <michelled> it refers to your github
2014-08-06T17:37:34 <Bosmon> michelled - yes, they all do
2014-08-06T17:37:49 <Bosmon> It\'s a problematic aspect of working with multiple repositories
2014-08-06T17:38:16 <Bosmon> But I think in general, the pusher will have to do this - since they can\'t always depend on the puller being around to work in lockstep with them : P
2014-08-06T17:38:21 <Bosmon> I\'m happy to do it now since I am here...
2014-08-06T17:38:30 <michelled> :)
2014-08-06T17:38:33 <michelled> thx
2014-08-06T17:38:56 <michelled> yes, that makes sense. as long as there is community consensus that the pusher can make that change and push
2014-08-06T17:39:11 <Bosmon> I think we should become a bit more forgiving about what pushers can do in general
2014-08-06T17:39:24 <Bosmon> Because we generate a lot of traffic for essential trivial changes these days, I think
2014-08-06T17:39:24 <michelled> yes
2014-08-06T17:39:44 <Bosmon> If a change relates to just packaging, commenting, whitespace or other trivial issues, the pusher should always feel justified in just doing it
2014-08-06T17:41:37 <Bosmon> michelled - ok, pushed
2014-08-06T17:52:19 <michelled> thx. Bosmon, do you still want the console.log here? https://github.com/amb26/node-jqUnit/blob/FLUID-5475/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L118
2014-08-06T17:58:44 <michelled> Bosmon: out of curiosity, is there a reason the \'test\' directory isn\'t called \'tests\'?
2014-08-06T18:27:15 <Bosmon> michelled - good catch... that console.log is responsible for a bit of misleading noise in the test traces
2014-08-06T18:27:46 <Bosmon> As for "test" all I can say is it appeared to be the convention at the time : P
2014-08-06T18:27:52 <Bosmon> Kettle\'s tests are also in "test"
2014-08-06T18:28:47 <michelled> fair enough
2014-08-06T18:30:01 * jessm has quit
2014-08-06T18:31:22 <Bosmon> michelled - it does appear that "test" is something of a standard for npm projects
2014-08-06T18:32:10 <Bosmon> I\'ve removed the stray console.log - thanks
2014-08-06T18:32:12 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: would anyone like to join the community meeting remotely today?
2014-08-06T18:32:18 <Justin_o> we\'ll be doing more work on docs
2014-08-06T18:32:53 <michelled> Bosmon: shall I update the reference to Infusion? or will you?

2014-08-06T19:23:57 <michelled> Bosmon: the node-jqUnit pull request has gone in
2014-08-06T19:24:02 <michelled> jhernandez: are you there?
2014-08-06T19:25:43 <Bosmon> michelled - thanks!
2014-08-06T19:27:09 <jhernandez> michelled: partially
2014-08-06T19:27:34 <michelled> I have you down for reviewing this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/264
2014-08-06T19:27:50 <jhernandez> now cooking - but I\'m using the pc to play music :)
2014-08-06T19:28:11 <michelled> I\'m not sure if you are able to, but once the reference to infusion and node-jqunit are updated, I think it\'s ready to go in
2014-08-06T19:28:24 <michelled> ah, cooking - what\'s for dinner jhernandez?
2014-08-06T19:28:53 <jhernandez> yeah, I can\'t merge prs yet, so that\'s the reason I pinged colin in my comment

2014-08-06T14:57:15 <michelled> hi Bosmon
2014-08-06T14:57:25 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled!
2014-08-06T14:57:48 <michelled> I was looking at your pull request: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/549/
2014-08-06T14:57:55 <michelled> and I was wondering how to run the node tests
2014-08-06T14:58:12 <michelled> I\'m currently getting an error, but I haven\'t created a package - do I need to do that?
2014-08-06T14:58:22 <Bosmon> What do you mean by creating a package?
2014-08-06T14:58:26 <michelled> Error: Cannot find module \'/Users/michelled/Code/infusion/projectRepo/tests/node-tests/basic-node-tests.js\'
2014-08-06T14:59:00 <michelled> your Readme says: "This directory contains a simple test fixture to verify the basic packaging of Fluid Infusion as a node module
2014-08-06T14:59:01 <michelled> +performed by the material in src/module/fluid.js ."
2014-08-06T15:00:35 <michelled> I suppose I\'m just a bit confused as to what I need to do to package Infusion as a node module. my guess was that all I needed was to run \'npm install\' but that didn\'t help.
2014-08-06T15:00:47 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 perhaps this isn\'t expected to work on Mac?
2014-08-06T15:01:27 <Bosmon> Why shouldn\'t it work on a Mac!
2014-08-06T15:01:48 <Bosmon> npm install shouldn\'t be necessary either
2014-08-06T15:01:59 <michelled> what version of node do you expect?
2014-08-06T15:02:11 <michelled> oh, really?
2014-08-06T15:02:11 <Bosmon> You should just be able to run node basic-node-test.js from the directory tests/node-tests
2014-08-06T15:02:28 <Bosmon> Currently we work with node 0.8.6 on Windows
2014-08-06T15:02:30 <Bosmon> let me test with 0.10
2014-08-06T15:02:43 <michelled> I\'ve got 0.10.25
2014-08-06T15:06:34 <Bosmon> michelled - it works fine with node 0.10.30 on Windows
2014-08-06T15:06:40 <Bosmon> Perhaps it is a file permission issue?
2014-08-06T15:06:48 <Bosmon> Maybe it won\'t run a .js file without 755 permissions, who knows
2014-08-06T15:06:51 <Bosmon> Do you want to try it?
2014-08-06T15:08:07 <michelled> same error
2014-08-06T15:09:11 <Bosmon> ok
2014-08-06T15:09:16 <Bosmon> What are you typing to run the tests?
2014-08-06T15:09:41 <michelled> node basic-node-tests.js
2014-08-06T15:09:52 <Bosmon> oh
2014-08-06T15:09:54 <Bosmon> There is a typo
2014-08-06T15:10:02 <Bosmon> Should be basic-node-test.js
2014-08-06T15:10:05 <Bosmon> Is the file actually there?
2014-08-06T15:10:54 <michelled> ah! thanks - that\'s a typo in the Readme file
2014-08-06T15:11:06 <Bosmon> Yes
2014-08-06T15:11:08 <Bosmon> Let me fix it now
2014-08-06T15:11:13 <michelled> thanks!
2014-08-06T15:11:18 <michelled> the tests run fine now
2014-08-06T15:12:09 <Bosmon> Ok, that\'s pushed
2014-08-06T15:12:14 <michelled> there were two other questions I had for you, Bosmon - they are comments on the pull. One was about the date of copyright notice and the other was about an API comment
2014-08-06T15:15:05 <michelled> so, just to clarify, when you are referring to \'Infusion packaged as a node module\' you are talking about the fluid.js file inside the module directory?
2014-08-06T15:15:56 <Bosmon> Well, I guess there are two closely related things - with pretty much the same effect
2014-08-06T15:16:15 <Bosmon> The "packaging" consists of our package.json file and the things it refers to, in particular the fluid.js file
2014-08-06T15:16:28 <Bosmon> But when used via "npm install" there is also the effect of the .npmignore file
2014-08-06T15:16:40 <Bosmon> Which will strip out of "infusion delivered as an npm module" everything that it refers to
2014-08-06T15:19:25 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-06T15:21:04 <michelled> so running the tests before and after \'npm install\' will test something a little different?
2014-08-06T15:23:06 <Bosmon> None of the files which are stripped out are referenced by any of the packaging
2014-08-06T15:23:24 <michelled> ah, fair enough
2014-08-06T15:23:44 <michelled> so, are the FluidDebuggingTests from 2010?
2014-08-06T15:26:07 <Bosmon> You can see the files included in the includes.json and devIncludes.json files in the "module" directory
2014-08-06T15:28:15 <Bosmon> michelled - I\'ve updated the copyright year and API comment now - thanks!
2014-08-06T15:28:24 <michelled> thank you
2014-08-06T16:00:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m having some trouble with the IoCTesting framework.
2014-08-06T16:01:00 <Justin_o> would you be able to help?
2014-08-06T16:01:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - certainly
2014-08-06T16:01:11 <Bosmon> Although GPII arch is beginning right now
2014-08-06T16:01:15 <Bosmon> It may have to be a little later
2014-08-06T16:01:16 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/6jR4h5VX
2014-08-06T16:01:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay... i\'ll just let you know the issue now and you can answer when you are free
2014-08-06T16:03:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the problem is that the sequenced test doesn\'t finish when i have lines 158 - 165 included.. if i have only one of those two listeners the tests complete as expected.
2014-08-06T16:03:10 <Justin_o> any idea what might be wrong?
2014-08-06T16:03:47 <michelled> Bosmon, colinclark, sgithens: architecture meeting
2014-08-06T16:04:29 * kasparnet joined the channel
2014-08-06T16:04:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - is it possible that one of those two events (onBindDialogHandlers and onDialogReady) is responsible for firing one of the others?
2014-08-06T16:05:07 <kasparnet> colinclark, Bosmon: arch meeting
2014-08-06T16:07:06 <Bosmon> kasparnet - trying to fire it up
2014-08-06T16:09:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: onDialogContentReady triggers an invoker which fires both onBindDialogHandlers and onDialogyReady
2014-08-06T16:10:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, this is probably the cause of your problems
2014-08-06T16:10:42 <Bosmon> Given that the order of notification of all the listeners to these events conjointly will be undefined
2014-08-06T16:11:03 <Bosmon> Given some listeners for the direct event will be notified before the "last" listeners to the earlier event
2014-08-06T16:11:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. do you have a suggestion for what i should do to work around this?
2014-08-06T16:12:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - a simple idea for a "quick fix" might be to defer the triggering of onBindDialogHandlers by wrapping it in a setTimout(1)
2014-08-06T16:12:58 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit of a bodge but at least should reveal whether we are on the right track

2014-08-06T16:23:51 * colinclark has quit
2014-08-06T16:30:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the settimeout didn\'t seem to make a difference
2014-08-06T16:31:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how about one for the firing of onDialogReady too
2014-08-06T16:31:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i tried both, same
2014-08-06T16:42:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i remove the listener for onDialogContentReady then the last two, onBinDialogHandlers and onDialogReady, work
2014-08-06T16:43:17 <Justin_o> which i guess it related to your point above.. any idea what do to work around this
2014-08-06T16:43:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - you need to ensure that the time points that you listen to will occur in a deterministic sequence
2014-08-06T16:44:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so they actually have to fire in the order which i have in the sequence?
2014-08-06T16:44:20 <Bosmon> So you can either i) put in delays to ensure the sequence, ii) listen to fewer points, or iii) if you don\'t care about the sequence, to not sequence the IoC tests on them
2014-08-06T16:44:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. does the priority i set in the sequence matter?
2014-08-06T16:45:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it matters, but it isn\'t sufficient by itself to cause the order to be deterministic
2014-08-06T16:45:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2014-08-06T16:46:21 <Bosmon> You can see another style of writing these kinds of tests in the framework at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L921
2014-08-06T16:46:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2014-08-06T16:46:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah right.. i remember this
2014-08-06T16:46:58 <Bosmon> If you have this kind of "don\'t-care nondeterminism" in your implementation, it\'s a safer strategy to not write IoC testing sequence points for these points, but instead to write listeners which push records onto a list
2014-08-06T16:47:34 <Bosmon> Then you can (optionally, sort the list into a canonical order if you don\'t care about some aspects of the order, and then) compare the list with a standard expected list using jqUnit.assertDeepEq
2014-08-06T16:48:26 <Bosmon> As we mentioned before, the IoC testing framework\'s sequence points are only meant to be used in cases of genuine asynchrony
2014-08-06T16:48:31 <Bosmon> Which it seems we don\'t have here
2014-08-06T16:50:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think i understand thanks.. but i don\'t really understand why the events aren\'t being fired deterministically... basically the onDialogContentReady event triggers the instantiateDialog invoker https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-207/src/components/feedback/js/bindDialog.js#L142
2014-08-06T16:50:45 <Justin_o> this invoker then fires the two other events https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-207/src/components/feedback/js/bindDialog.js#L213-L233
2014-08-06T16:51:08 <Justin_o> shouldn\'t those always happen in the same order.. assuming that.dialog is falsey
2014-08-06T16:51:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - and so if you have a "last" listener attached to the first event, this will only fire at a point AFTER the two subsequent events have finished firing
2014-08-06T16:51:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. so the "last" priority does matter in the sequece
2014-08-06T16:51:56 <Bosmon> If you have events that fire one to the other synchronously in a chain, you\'re likely to lose control over the exact sequencing of listeners of different priorities amongst the different events
2014-08-06T16:52:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - "last" listeners to event 1 will in this case be notified AFTER "last" listeners to events 2 and 3
2014-08-06T16:52:35 <Bosmon> Since the firer of event 2 is itself one of the standard listeners to event 1
2014-08-06T16:53:07 <Bosmon> And the firer of event 3 is a standard listener to event 2
2014-08-06T16:53:42 <Bosmon> The entirety of the firing process of events 2 and 3 will then finish completely, including their "last" listeners, before any further processing is done on event 1
2014-08-06T16:55:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. and in my case both event 2 and 3 are basically listeners to event 1
2014-08-06T16:56:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so basically i want to make sure that the logic from instantiate dialog happens.. essentially that the that.dialog has been set

2014-08-06T16:57:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you think i should just skip checking the fire of onDialogContentReady? since onDialogReady also includes the that.dialog as an argument to it\'s fire call

2014-08-06T17:09:08 <michelled> Bosmon: is looks like \'basic-node-tests.js\' is a new file also but has an old copyright date
2014-08-06T17:29:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it might be worth just consolidating all of that fixture so that it just occupies a single sequence point, yes
