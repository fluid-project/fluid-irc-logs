2014-07-04T14:06:20 <amilchev> hi, jhernandez, tell me if you\'re here
2014-07-04T14:10:36 <clown> cindyli:  http://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/#keyboard-focus_tabindex
2014-07-04T14:25:24 <jhernandez> amilchev: yes I am!
2014-07-04T14:29:20 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\'ve had another look at your FLUID-5439 pull request - two small things
2014-07-04T14:29:53 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac. will take a look
2014-07-04T14:31:14 <amilchev> jhernandez: I was trying to run pcp & pmt under Ubuntu - I know it\'s considered unsupported, but have you ever done that?
2014-07-04T14:31:23 <jhernandez> nope
2014-07-04T14:31:32 <jhernandez> but it shouldn\'t be a problem
2014-07-04T14:31:53 <amilchev> jhernandez: I tested with pilot2 branch of universal, set NODE_ENV to "pilot2" (as with windows, not sure if this is correct)
2014-07-04T14:32:14 <jhernandez> and if you put gnome as the default desktop it should work 100%
2014-07-04T14:32:20 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-04T14:32:45 <jhernandez> to use that config you should run NODE_ENV=pilot2 node gpii.js
2014-07-04T14:33:08 <amilchev> also, I noticed that the preferences server is locally deployed
2014-07-04T14:33:28 <jhernandez> with the pilot2 branch?
2014-07-04T14:33:35 <jhernandez> it should use the remote prefs server
2014-07-04T14:33:43 <amilchev> and it shouldn\'t be according to pilots configs (or at least I thought we use remote prefs sever)
2014-07-04T14:34:39 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-07-04T14:34:39 <amilchev> yes, I ran ./build.sh, went to universal, checked out pilots2 branch, deleted node_modules directory in universal and ran npm instsall
2014-07-04T14:36:00 <amilchev> also, I tried to log a user manually localhost:8081/user/carla/login and got an error "* You forgot to call g_type_init() *"
2014-07-04T14:36:11 <jhernandez> ohh
2014-07-04T14:36:27 <amilchev> this seem pretty messed up or I\'m doing sth wrong... maybe both
2014-07-04T14:37:44 <amilchev> hm
2014-07-04T14:37:53 <jhernandez> the explanation is on a thread called "Flow Manager: User login not working on Ubuntu", on the architecture list
2014-07-04T14:38:15 <jhernandez> is your personal OS?
2014-07-04T14:38:22 <jhernandez> or it\'s just a lab-machine?
2014-07-04T14:38:28 <amilchev> jhernandez personal
2014-07-04T14:38:32 <jhernandez> ok
2014-07-04T14:39:37 <amilchev> jhernandez well I ran NODE_ENV=pilot2 node gpii.js as you said and I seem to have got the correct pilot 2 setup (all servers locally deployed except for remote prefs server)
2014-07-04T14:39:55 <jhernandez> cool
2014-07-04T14:40:06 <amilchev> jhernandez previously I tried NODE_ENV=pilot2 and then simply  ./start.sh
2014-07-04T14:40:11 <jhernandez> oh
2014-07-04T14:40:12 <jhernandez> I asee
2014-07-04T14:40:16 <jhernandez> *I see
2014-07-04T14:40:17 <jhernandez> no prob
2014-07-04T14:40:41 <amilchev> jhernandez I\'ll let you know if I have another question, thanks for now :)
2014-07-04T14:41:06 <amilchev> about the g_type_init() error now I remember seeing that some time ago on list (y)
2014-07-04T14:41:09 <jhernandez> in relation to your g_type_init() problem
2014-07-04T14:41:40 <jhernandez> yeah, all the info is on that thread
2014-07-04T14:42:16 * michelled has quit
2014-07-04T14:42:28 <jhernandez> but you can add the required g_type_inits in order to make it working properly
2014-07-04T14:43:06 <jhernandez> but in any case, this doesn\'t guarantee that it\'ll work if you\'re running Unity
2014-07-04T14:44:25 <amilchev> jhernandez you mean just adding this deleted line at the same place? https://github.com/GPII/linux/commit/4225aab80674710b6d01391120ce6c797955d0ba
2014-07-04T14:44:35 <jhernandez> yeah
2014-07-04T14:44:44 <amilchev> cool, thx
2014-07-04T14:45:07 <jhernandez> and for the rest of the native add-ons
2014-07-04T14:46:11 <jhernandez> these are: find | grep "\\.cc"
2014-07-04T14:46:16 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-04T14:48:28 <amilchev> jhernandez (y)
2014-07-04T14:49:09 <jhernandez> and, of course, you need to re-compile the linux modules
2014-07-04T14:49:14 <amilchev> jhernandez yeah I finally got it to work :)
2014-07-04T14:49:24 <jhernandez> yup
2014-07-04T14:49:41 <amilchev> thanks!  : )
2014-07-04T14:50:20 <jhernandez> maybe I should take some time to add a #ifdef block and call it accordingly
2014-07-04T14:50:22 <jhernandez> amilchev: yw
2014-07-04T14:50:23 <jhernandez> :)
2014-07-04T14:51:07 <cindyli> anastasiac: your comments for FLUID-5439 have been addressed and pushed up. Can you take a look when you have a chance?
2014-07-04T14:51:21 <anastasiac> will do, thanks cindyli
2014-07-04T14:51:36 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac

2014-07-04T15:12:08 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac
2014-07-04T15:20:43 <cindyli> anastasiac: your comments for 5456 have been addressed. ready for another review.
2014-07-04T15:20:51 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli

2014-07-04T18:00:03 <michelled> colinclark: when you get a chance, can you please merge this in? https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/70
2014-07-04T18:02:17 <michelled> colinclark_: ^
2014-07-04T18:02:57 <colinclark_> sure, I just need someone walk me through the process
2014-07-04T18:03:01 <colinclark_> So I merge this to the GPII repo
2014-07-04T18:03:07 <colinclark_> do I do anything with the fluid fork of it?
2014-07-04T18:03:52 <michelled> I think cindyli and justin_o have been managing the fluid fork. I\'m not sure how close it is to the GPII repo at this point
2014-07-04T18:04:36 <michelled> cindyli: do you know if colinclark_ needs to merge the GPII prefs editors repo into the fluid fork?
2014-07-04T18:05:17 <cindyli> michelled, colinclark, sorry, i don\'t know
2014-07-04T18:07:00 <michelled> colinclark_: I think you should merge it into the GPII repo. I\'ll talk to justin about the fluid fork on Monday
2014-07-04T18:07:00 * yzen_ has quit
2014-07-04T18:07:16 <colinclark_> ok
2014-07-04T18:07:18 <colinclark_> cool
2014-07-04T18:07:25 <colinclark_> I guess it\'s a kind of interesting workflow
2014-07-04T18:07:33 * yzen joined the channel
2014-07-04T18:07:42 <colinclark_> in that we sort of have an "upstream" and a "further upstream" repo
2014-07-04T18:09:29 <michelled> yes
2014-07-04T18:19:46 <michelled> thanks for the merge colinclark_!
2014-07-04T18:20:03 <colinclark_> no problem
