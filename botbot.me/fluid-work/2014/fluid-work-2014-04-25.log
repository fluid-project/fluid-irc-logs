2014-04-25T16:03:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: I left a comment on the the FLUID-4968 pull request and have filed a new jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5320 for the lineSpace issue.
2014-04-25T16:03:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: let me know if there is anything else I\'ll need to do for the pull to make it into master
2014-04-25T16:04:33 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o.
2014-04-25T16:04:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: i also found some capitalization typos for the includes in the enactor tests which I\'ve fixed
2014-04-25T16:05:00 <cindyli> nice.

2014-04-25T16:15:06 <Justin_o> michelled: i just filed this http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5320
2014-04-25T16:15:16 <Justin_o> michelled: i\'m on the fence about whether or not this should be fixed for 1.5
2014-04-25T16:15:28 <Justin_o> any thoughts?

2014-04-25T16:22:45 <michelled> Justin_o: I think it would be *very* bad practise to make a release that has failing tests
2014-04-25T16:23:05 <michelled> so I think that means we need to fix it or work around it
2014-04-25T16:38:46 * [o__o] joined the channel
2014-04-25T16:38:54 <cindyli> can you decide if they should be fixed for 1.5 release
2014-04-25T16:39:53 <Justin_o> cindyli, jhung, michelled: i\'d say at least FLUID-5321 should be fixed

2014-04-25T16:49:52 <anastasiac> Justin_o, for upgrading the exploration tool to the latest master: Should I be working of GPII\'s version of the repo, or fluid-project\'s version?
2014-04-25T16:50:13 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'d work in the fluid-project version
2014-04-25T16:50:33 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m not sure if it is up-to-date though.. i\'ll update it now
2014-04-25T16:50:34 <anastasiac> ok, Justin_o - is that what we\'ve got deployed for that demo now?
2014-04-25T16:50:39 <anastasiac> it\'s not up to date, no
2014-04-25T16:51:15 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, it should be updated now
2014-04-25T16:51:26 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2014-04-25T16:59:22 <jhung> Justin_o: looking at FLUID-5321, I\'ll see what can be done.
2014-04-25T16:59:49 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-04-25T17:00:14 <Justin_o> jhung: if we can do FLUID-5322 as well that would be great, but if not we can push that off
2014-04-25T17:00:40 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, i left a couple of comments on your pull request
2014-04-25T17:00:45 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/496
2014-04-25T17:02:20 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. I\'ll address the pull request first to get that merged in then look at FLUID-5321 and 5322.
2014-04-25T17:02:31 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2014-04-25T17:07:49 <cindyli> Justin_o, michelled: i filed a jira for builder test failure in IE8 - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5323. please decide whether it should be fixed for 1.5 release
2014-04-25T17:15:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: is there any more info you can provide about what the failure is
2014-04-25T17:16:04 <cindyli> ah sure, Justin_o
2014-04-25T17:16:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2014-04-25T17:17:01 <cindyli> updated, Justin_o
2014-04-25T17:17:06 <Justin_o> thanks
2014-04-25T17:17:48 <cindyli> np
2014-04-25T17:28:15 <anastasiac> simonjb: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Project+Coordination
2014-04-25T17:43:18 <michelled> cindyli: did you ever open the JIRA about moving the predefined OER out of a string and into plain HTML in the metadata demo?
2014-04-25T17:47:32 <sgithens> simonjb: Saw your email.  The js docccer is in github, but probably hard to figure out how to run.  I\'ll add a grunt task to it this weekend and then hopefully you can try it
2014-04-25T17:47:49 <sgithens> by weekend, I probably mean before next wednesdays meeting
2014-04-25T17:47:56 <sgithens> but maybe weekend
2014-04-25T17:49:24 <cindyli> michelled: yes - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-182
2014-04-25T17:49:44 <michelled> ah, thanks!
2014-04-25T17:50:00 <simonjb> sgithens: awesome, thanks!
2014-04-25T17:50:50 <simonjb> sgithens: I will add a jira issue and assign to you to create a grunt task -- ok?
2014-04-25T17:52:28 <sgithens> simonjb: Sure, or just \'clean it up\'. I think it might depend on you being in a specific directory still.  Just clean up the cli
2014-04-25T17:52:42 <simonjb> sgithens: which repo does your doc tool live in?
2014-04-25T17:54:09 <sgithens> https://github.com/sgithens/lichen   There is some other crap in there I need to remove that\'s unrelated
2014-04-25T17:54:26 <sgithens> and name it back to fluid-tags or something
2014-04-25T17:54:39 <sgithens> https://github.com/sgithens/fluid-tags
2014-04-25T17:55:43 <simonjb> sgithens: so the work would be to move the doc tool to the fluid-tags repo and make it easily runnable?
2014-04-25T17:56:05 <sgithens> I\'ll probably just rename the repo
2014-04-25T17:56:24 <sgithens> but yeah, make it easily runnable
2014-04-25T17:56:33 <simonjb> what is the tool called?
2014-04-25T17:56:47 <simonjb> lichen?
2014-04-25T17:57:22 <sgithens> fluid-tags is what you actually run at the command line
2014-04-25T17:57:31 <sgithens> I\'ll stick with that name for now
2014-04-25T17:57:40 <simonjb> ok, cool
2014-04-25T17:58:00 <simonjb> thanks steve
2014-04-25T17:58:09 <sgithens> thank you!
2014-04-25T18:01:37 <sgithens> simonjb : also I\'m going to remove the copy of codemirror I have checked in and add a bower command to fetch it
2014-04-25T18:02:47 <simonjb> sgithens: what output does your tool generate? does it make HTML or just ctags?
2014-04-25T18:02:54 <sgithens> both
2014-04-25T18:02:59 <simonjb> cool
2014-04-25T18:03:25 <sgithens> it makes ctags that gedit can consume ( I haven\'t tried them elsewhere, but might try them in vim )
2014-04-25T18:03:44 <sgithens> and the html type page that I linked during the arch meetings in san diego
2014-04-25T18:05:00 <simonjb> I don\'t think I saw the html page in san diego - I must have missed
2014-04-25T18:05:11 <sgithens> let me find it quick
2014-04-25T18:05:16 <simonjb> sgithens: awesome!
2014-04-25T18:06:06 <simonjb> sgithens: I was just making the jira at issues.fluidproject.org but I don\'t see you to assign to - do you have an account there?
2014-04-25T18:06:17 <sgithens> sgithens: http://githens.org/fluid-js-doc-dec24.html#fluid.eventedComponent
2014-04-25T18:06:54 <sgithens> that\'s a bad example
2014-04-25T18:07:03 <sgithens> if you look through, some of them to pull out the docstrings
2014-04-25T18:07:08 <sgithens> um
2014-04-25T18:07:15 <sgithens> I guess maybe I don\'t
2014-04-25T18:07:27 <sgithens> but i thought I would have from the sakai days
2014-04-25T18:08:26 <sgithens> (making one now)
2014-04-25T18:08:37 <simonjb> great, thanks
2014-04-25T18:09:37 <simonjb> sgithens: what title would you like for the jira ticket?
2014-04-25T18:11:05 <sgithens> oh
2014-04-25T18:11:13 <sgithens> I already have a sgithens user name apparently
2014-04-25T18:11:18 <anastasiac> michelled, Justin_o, first pass: http://172.16.2.126:8888/GPII/source/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/
2014-04-25T18:12:35 <simonjb> sgithens: hmm, do you have 2 accounts now?
2014-04-25T18:12:46 <simonjb> or still just one?
2014-04-25T18:13:03 <sgithens> just one
2014-04-25T18:13:04 <simonjb> I will look to see why I\'m not seeing you as an assignee
2014-04-25T18:13:11 <sgithens> there is a chance it\'s hooked up to my cambridge account
2014-04-25T18:13:18 <sgithens> to which I have no email anymore
2014-04-25T18:13:22 <sgithens> username is sgithens
2014-04-25T18:13:38 <sgithens> if you can change the email to swgithen@mtu.edu and reset the password that would be good
2014-04-25T18:13:47 <sgithens> I think it was...
2014-04-25T18:13:52 <simonjb> ok, I will have a look
2014-04-25T18:13:57 <sgithens> s-githens@caret.cam.ac.uk
2014-04-25T18:14:00 <sgithens> or something
2014-04-25T18:14:11 <sgithens> I didn\'t get an email from trying to reset it online
2014-04-25T18:15:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac: looks good.. i think this part of the instructions "To try randomly selected changes, click the "try something new" link to the left of the panel." should maybe be "on the left side of the panel" or something like that. currently it sounds a bit like it\'s beside the exploration tool panel, rather than part of it
