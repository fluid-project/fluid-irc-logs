2014-02-14T15:51:32 <cindyli> np
2014-02-14T15:59:14 <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry.. missed something with the README so left another comment.. should have caught it earlier
2014-02-14T15:59:15 <Justin_o> sorry
2014-02-14T15:59:35 <cindyli> no problem, will address
2014-02-14T16:12:34 <cindyli> good catch, Justin_o. regarding where cwd should be documented, i was looking at the readme from grunt-contrib-copy (https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-copy), cwd is presented and explained in the usage examples. I\'m thinking of doing same. what do you think?
2014-02-14T16:13:21 <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds good
2014-02-14T16:29:30 <cindyli> Justin_o: fixed and pushed

2014-02-14T16:59:48 <cindyli> have you tagged it to the next version, Justin_o
2014-02-14T17:00:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: not yet.. i\'m working on that part now

2014-02-14T19:32:31 <cindyli> Justin_o: i sent a pull request to remove the "src" directory from the infusion build file - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/469. can you review it?

2014-02-14T19:49:25 <Justin_o> cindyli: are you also going to fix the issue with the licenses being missing from the release?
2014-02-14T19:49:40 <Justin_o> we may also want the release notes in the build too i guess
2014-02-14T19:50:32 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o. thinking to do it after the pull 469 gets in since those files will be at the same directory level as infusion-all.js
2014-02-14T19:51:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: that pull looks good, would you mind making the next fix based on it? the testing cost is pretty high so i\'d rather group these together because they are fairly small.
2014-02-14T19:52:39 <cindyli> make sense, Justin_o. will do it
2014-02-14T19:52:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
