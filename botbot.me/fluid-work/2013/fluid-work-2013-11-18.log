2013-11-18T13:50:18 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello.. how are you? I\'m not sure if cindyli talked to you last week, but we were wondering if you had more adjusters that you needed us to merge in or if there was another pull request we needed to look at for you?
2013-11-18T13:56:16 <amilchev> hi Justin_o
2013-11-18T13:57:48 <amilchev> Justin_o: I\'m ready with working version of these adjuster groups http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/adjusters-for2ndpilots.pdf
2013-11-18T13:58:18 <Justin_o> amilchev: all of them?
2013-11-18T13:58:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: no, volume, language & visual alternatives, Chris is responsible for the others
2013-11-18T13:59:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay cool.. and you are using the composite panel for visual alternatives?
2013-11-18T13:59:55 <amilchev> Justin_o: I\'m also ready with sending the saved settings to the preferences server http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-266 - currently I\'m sending them to a local server (for testing reasons), but I could easily change the url ..
2013-11-18T14:00:18 <amilchev> Justin_o: no, I\'m not using the composite panel since Chris informed me that it\'s still not ready.. is it?
2013-11-18T14:02:02 * kasparnet joined the channel
2013-11-18T14:02:07 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. let me try to remember now.. it is in the gpii prefs repo.. but i can\'t remember if we have any bug fixes that need to go in.. the one thing that isn\'t in there yet is the hide/show on model changes.. that is still waiting final code review in Infusion.. At any rate, it shouldn\'t be too much work to add it in when you start using it
2013-11-18T14:02:08 <amilchev> Justin_o: I asked at Thursday\'s meeting for priorities - Michelle told me that sending the settings to the prefs server is more important than updating infusion for now (so that other teams can carry on with the rest)
2013-11-18T14:02:22 <Justin_o> amilchev: makes sense
2013-11-18T14:02:27 <Justin_o> sorry i missed that meeting
2013-11-18T14:03:07 <amilchev> Justin_o: no problem, the 1 question I had prepared for you was the update of the latest Infusion (and when should I update)
2013-11-18T14:03:21 <amilchev> the status* of the latest infusion update
2013-11-18T14:04:49 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'d like to get this pull request in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/433
2013-11-18T14:05:13 <Justin_o> we had some large issues with it, which took some time to sort out, but hopefully they are all cleared up now
2013-11-18T14:05:33 <Justin_o> i\'ll probably update infusion in the prefsEditors repo after that goes in
2013-11-18T14:05:36 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-11-18T14:06:02 <amilchev> Justin_o: sounds good, let me know when that happens..
2013-11-18T14:07:04 <Justin_o> amilchev: you and chris will probably need these fixes for the composite panel too. they are already merged into infusion and will be in the next update. http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5210 http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5211
2013-11-18T14:07:17 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. we\'ll let you guys know
2013-11-18T14:09:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, what branch are you working in for your adjusters?
2013-11-18T14:10:00 <amilchev> Justin_o: https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/tree/gpii-271
2013-11-18T14:11:19 <amilchev> Justin_o: I just pushed my updates
2013-11-18T14:11:19 * greggy joined the channel
2013-11-18T14:11:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay thanks.. is this branch basically all done, except for the composite panel part?
2013-11-18T14:12:54 <amilchev> Justin_o: The PMT part is done, the PCP part is 95% done, I just need to fix small stuff
2013-11-18T14:13:25 <amilchev> Justin_o: and remember we\'re still talking about language, volume and visual alternatives only
2013-11-18T14:14:01 <Justin_o> amilchev: we should probably sync up with cindyli
2013-11-18T14:14:08 <Justin_o> to make sure we aren\'t duplicating any work
2013-11-18T14:14:45 <Justin_o> amilchev: perhaps we\'ll be able to merge your branch into the branch cleanup we were working on
2013-11-18T14:15:55 <amilchev> Justin_o: I may need to go through the code with jsLint & perhaps fix some names (or unused code) - after that is done (which will probably be tomorrow) - after that, what should I do?
2013-11-18T14:16:20 <amilchev> (sorry for repeating "after that" :D)
2013-11-18T14:17:32 <amilchev> Justin_o: should I inform other teams that there is a working version of these  adj groups and their models are being sent to the pref server (so that they can take it from there soon) or should I wait for that?
2013-11-18T14:17:42 <amilchev> sorry if you\'re not the right person to ask...
2013-11-18T14:25:39 <Justin_o> amilchev: i guess you can bring it up at tomorrow\'s meeting, but i\'d guess you should file a pull request and let people know that it\'s there and what it does
2013-11-18T14:27:18 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok, I won\'t rush it - I\'ll make final adjustments to my code and make a pull
2013-11-18T14:27:39 <Justin_o> amilchev: sounds good..
2013-11-18T14:30:19 * kasparnet has quit
2013-11-18T14:54:41 <amilchev> Justin_o: by the way, something I noticed
2013-11-18T14:59:28 <amilchev> Justin_o: since the visibility state of the adjusters depends on the state of a switch, let\'s say it\'s ON. After saving, the value of this switch is still ON (of course), but the previously hidden adjusters (which are shown by setting the switch ON) are hidden - I guess refreshView() is called
2013-11-18T14:59:51 <amilchev> Justin_o: I was wondering how can I avoid that, perhaps I\'ll ask tomorrow
2013-11-18T15:00:37 <amilchev> Justin_o: you may still answer if you find time to, I\'m leaving now (will see it tomorrrow if u answer). Have a nice day :)

2013-11-18T15:11:51 <Justin_o> amilchev: sorry i missed you. Hope you\'ll see this. the work in the FLUID-5205 branch is to address just this. It will handle the expansion based on the on/off switch. So you\'ll just need to add some configuration to your auxschema and it will just work
