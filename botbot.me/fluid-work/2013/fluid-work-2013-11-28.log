2013-11-28T15:35:38 <cindyli> just a reminder on reviewing the pull request for FLUID-5213: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/438
2013-11-28T15:45:26 <anastasiac> yzen, can you give me an ETA on some answers to Ray\'s questions for PageBuilder, RecordEditor?

2013-11-28T18:35:53 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - I gave some further comments on the JIRA a couple of days ago:
2013-11-28T18:35:54 <Bosmon> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5213#comment-24029
2013-11-28T18:36:01 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-11-28T18:36:21 <cindyli> sorry, didn\'t see that, Bosmon. on it
2013-11-28T18:38:30 * michelled joined the channel
2013-11-28T18:42:41 <Bosmon> colinclark: 3 mins until perihelion!
2013-11-28T18:44:12 <colinclark> Bosmon: So exciting!
2013-11-28T18:44:18 <colinclark> http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/Comet-ISON-Updates-193909261.html
2013-11-28T18:44:48 <colinclark> I will be at the cottage this weekend, so if the comet does survive, I\'ll be in a good spot for it
2013-11-28T18:45:10 <Bosmon> You\'ll still need to view it via a chimney or lamppost : P
2013-11-28T18:45:29 <colinclark> :)
2013-11-28T18:45:43 <anastasiac> Justin_o, have the full-page prefs editor "manual test" pages been kept up-to-date with the latest preferred methods of instantiating prefs editors?
2013-11-28T18:45:46 <colinclark> because it will be so close to the sun, still, I guess

2013-11-28T19:28:39 <michelled> Bosmon: I\'m finding that the primary builder tests are failing for me with your 5212 pull request in
2013-11-28T19:28:48 <michelled> did they work for you?
2013-11-28T19:29:23 <Bosmon> michelled - sorry, I may have broken it with my last commit last night....
2013-11-28T19:34:24 <Bosmon> michelled - unfortunately it is the tests and impl that are going to have to change
2013-11-28T19:34:30 <Bosmon> Since I believe the FLUID-5212 algorithm is now correct
2013-11-28T19:34:47 <Bosmon> I guess the primary builder has been "coding to an implementation" rather than a principle....
2013-11-28T19:36:00 <cindyli> Bosmon: thanks for the jira comment for 5213. The implementation has been simplified and pushed up. Hope now it\'s not that "white elephant". :)
2013-11-28T19:37:23 <michelled> Bosmon: what sorts of changes need to happen in the primary builder?
2013-11-28T19:37:48 <Bosmon> michelled - it needs to put its dynamic grades in the opposite order
2013-11-28T19:37:55 <Bosmon> So they override in the correct priority

2013-11-28T20:47:43 <michelled> Justin_o: should this template be removed from the repo?  src/shared/adjusters/html/magnifierFollowsTemplate.html
2013-11-28T20:47:52 <michelled> it has a deprecation comment at the top

2013-11-28T20:57:26 <Justin_o> michelled: I think it\'s needed for the demos that are in there now, but it is something that is being remade by the gpii folks
