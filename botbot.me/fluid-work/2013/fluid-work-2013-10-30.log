b'2013-10-30T21:35:46 <Bosmon> An.... "applicable" : P
2013-10-30T21:35:48 <colinclark> or rather, a function-like thing
2013-10-30T21:35:49 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-30T21:35:50 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-30T21:35:51 <colinclark> I get it

2013-10-30T21:40:37 <colinclark> you need more farm.cats in your test cases, Bosmon
2013-10-30T21:40:43 <Bosmon> :) :)
2013-10-30T21:41:03 <Bosmon> Rather than "things"? : P
2013-10-30T21:41:21 <colinclark> nests of things
2013-10-30T21:41:32 <colinclark> I suppose it\'s a lot easier to keep track

2013-10-30T21:44:04 <colinclark> It\'s really odd that Git found conflicts in this merge
2013-10-30T21:44:08 <colinclark> since it\'s pretty clear to me what changed
2013-10-30T21:44:15 <Bosmon> They are probably in the five-star demo
2013-10-30T21:44:16 <Bosmon> ?
2013-10-30T21:44:26 <colinclark> yep
2013-10-30T21:44:41 <colinclark> two very obvious ones
2013-10-30T21:44:44 <Bosmon> There was still a "diamond change"
2013-10-30T21:44:55 <Bosmon> So it could never have been certain that the other changes were not required
2013-10-30T21:45:52 <colinclark> a "diamond change?"
2013-10-30T21:46:05 <Bosmon> There were two separate changes along different paths to the parent revision
2013-10-30T21:46:23 <Bosmon> Along one, "dynamic: true" was added, and along another, the entire block was removed and replaced with the declarative binding...

2013-10-30T15:05:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: missed that, thanks for pointing it out
2013-10-30T15:05:54 <colinclark> looks like you saw it in email, though :)
2013-10-30T15:06:33 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: sorry i missed your message here. if you want to get a hold of me directly, feel free to ping my nick here.
2013-10-30T15:07:53 <chrispetsos> ooooh, so i need to write something like: "Hi Justin_o" to alert you?
2013-10-30T15:08:44 <chrispetsos> IRC apps have become more sophisticated since i have been using them...
2013-10-30T15:09:15 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. you just have to write our nick and the client should send an alert
2013-10-30T15:09:42 <chrispetsos> OK then Justin_o, need to run now, i\'ll know that for the next time! Thanks and bye!

2013-10-30T15:37:48 <colinclark> Justin_o: I\'ve had some trouble reviewing Bosmon\'s fix for http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5172 because of a lot of failures in IE 8
2013-10-30T15:37:57 <colinclark> And maybe I\'m just doing something dumb
2013-10-30T15:38:20 <Justin_o> colinclark: did you want me to try it out on my IE8 vm?
2013-10-30T15:38:24 <colinclark> Certainly, without his fix, I get many more failures
2013-10-30T15:38:33 <Justin_o> :) progress
2013-10-30T15:38:41 <colinclark> :)
2013-10-30T15:39:09 <colinclark> I guess I\'d be curious to hear what results you get, if it\'s not terribly inconvenient
2013-10-30T15:39:21 <colinclark> Right now I\'m actually testing with a fresh Windows 7 and IE8
2013-10-30T15:40:11 <Justin_o> sure i\'ll take a look at it after standup

2013-10-30T21:35:20 <Bosmon> colinclark - it is used to conform the signature of the "returned thing" to the standard one for Function.apply
2013-10-30T21:35:33 <colinclark> ah, yes
2013-10-30T21:35:37 <colinclark> you\'re making an apply-like thing
