2013-12-09T16:31:44 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have the information about how to write the metadata to the markup?
2013-12-09T16:32:08 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m finishing that right now.
2013-12-09T16:32:13 <Justin_o> jhung: okay...
2013-12-09T16:32:23 <Justin_o> jhung: also what do you want for the video placeholder.. an image?
2013-12-09T16:32:40 <Justin_o> or we could make some styled markup
2013-12-09T16:34:02 <jhung> Justin_o: probably just a grey box with a disabled play button overlay? danaayotte_, any thoughts?
2013-12-09T16:35:03 <jhung> Justin_o I can walk you through the metadata generation when it\'s done. anastasiac - do you think you can join us? Your feedback may be valuable.
2013-12-09T16:35:31 <anastasiac> jhung, sure, I can join whenever
2013-12-09T16:35:36 <jhung> cool

2013-12-09T16:57:44 <jhung> 1p anastasiac, Justin_o?
2013-12-09T16:57:57 <anastasiac> works for me
2013-12-09T16:58:13 <anastasiac> I was just wondering if I have time to go shovel my Mom\'s walk :-)
2013-12-09T16:58:42 <jhung> anastasiac: Go for it. :)
2013-12-09T17:00:00 <Justin_o> jhung: 1pm works for me
2013-12-09T17:00:31 <jhung> great

2013-12-09T17:12:06 <jhung> danaayotte_: sure!
2013-12-09T17:12:22 <danaayotte_> jhung, justin_o I think a grey box with a play button overlay sounds good for video placeholder
2013-12-09T17:12:33 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: thanks
2013-12-09T17:12:44 <jhung> Anyone else interested in joining the metadata chat, please let me know. We\'re meeting 1pm ET on skype.
2013-12-09T17:14:03 <michelled> I\'d like to listen in jhung
2013-12-09T17:15:11 <jhung> michelled: alright. I\'ll ping you when the time comes.

2013-12-09T17:55:46 <jhung> thanks michelled. I haven\'t seen inkscape before, but its method of metadata authoring is similar to other metadata forms I\'ve seen (coincidentally, also Dublin Core metadata).

2013-12-09T18:50:21 <cindyli> Justin_o: as you know I\'ve created a metadata summary panel that shows the availability states of each metadata. since this panel is not going to be used in the demo, just wanna double confirm that it shouldn\'t be included in the pull request, right?
2013-12-09T18:50:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: if you can separate it out, that would probably be better
2013-12-09T18:50:58 <cindyli> ok, thanks, Justin_o

2013-12-09T20:23:28 <Bosmon> cindyli, Justin_o, michelled - I am taking a look at https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/js/indicator.js
2013-12-09T20:23:47 <Bosmon> What do you think about the fact that the naming of styles and their purposes in the code explicitly refers to colours?
2013-12-09T20:23:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2013-12-09T20:24:14 <michelled> good catch Bosmon - it should be changed
2013-12-09T20:24:22 <michelled> the indicator tests need some refactoring too
2013-12-09T20:27:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: i wrote that. wonder how it can be improved. use "fl-available" rather than "fl-green"?
2013-12-09T20:31:45 <michelled> I think that would be better cindyli
2013-12-09T20:32:07 <michelled> since we are talking about state - it just so happen that we currently show an available state at green
2013-12-09T20:32:30 <cindyli> makes sense. thanks, michelled
2013-12-09T20:32:39 <michelled> I think the \'indicatorColors\' block should be renamed as well
2013-12-09T20:32:52 <michelled> indicatorState, maybe?
2013-12-09T20:33:56 <michelled> cindyli: I just commented on your JIRA: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-108#comment-24047
2013-12-09T20:34:48 <cindyli> cool. thanks, michelled

2013-12-09T20:41:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we also had a rendering question for you.. can you add decorators to input expanders
2013-12-09T20:41:18 <cindyli> jhung, danaayotte_: in terms of the audio panel for the metadata demo. do you expect the checkboxes for "dialogue", "soundtrack" etc to be disabled when the selection of the radio button is on "no" or "not sure"?
2013-12-09T20:42:00 <jhung> cindyli: yes. Disable those checkboxes until they select yes to audio.
2013-12-09T20:42:07 <cindyli> ok
2013-12-09T20:42:15 <cindyli> thanks, jhung
2013-12-09T20:46:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what is an "input expander"?
2013-12-09T20:46:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :(

2013-12-09T20:48:09 * anvk has quit
2013-12-09T20:52:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t think you\'ll succeed in attaching decorators to the rows, no
2013-12-09T20:52:30 <Bosmon> I do wish people would stop trying to use the "old renderer" : P
2013-12-09T20:52:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2013-12-09T20:54:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. do you have a suggestion for how we could render out a set of checkboxes with a disabled state.. we will use conditional expanders, but if we can\'t use decorators i\'m not sure how we can set the state
2013-12-09T20:54:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o, you may as well just write your own "expander"
2013-12-09T20:55:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh okay...
2013-12-09T20:55:44 <Bosmon> It\'s not like the old one did anything particularly magical : P
2013-12-09T20:55:51 <Bosmon> The whole idea of "expanders", as we know, is rubbish, in any case
2013-12-09T20:57:49 <colinclark> Won\'t it be amazing when we have a new Renderer?
2013-12-09T20:57:57 * anvk joined the channel
2013-12-09T21:00:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. we\'ll take a look at what the expander did..
