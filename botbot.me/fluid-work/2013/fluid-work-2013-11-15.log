b"2013-11-15T19:13:44 <cindyli> yes, all passing
2013-11-15T19:13:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. what was the problem?
2013-11-15T19:14:37 <cindyli> Justin_o: might be caused by a variable name change which needs to pay attention at resolving conflicts
2013-11-15T19:14:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: ah okay.. that makes sense
2013-11-15T19:15:00 <Justin_o> thanks for fixing that up
2013-11-15T19:15:09 <cindyli> np
2013-11-15T19:16:15 <Justin_o> okay.. it's up in the pull request now
2013-11-15T19:16:47 <Justin_o> anastasiac, Bosmon7: can you please take a look at the FLUID-5205 pull request again.. it should be ready to go for another round of review
2013-11-15T19:17:20 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o, I'll have another go at it. I'm sure I can find a problem ;-)
2013-11-15T19:18:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: hopefully they won't be blockers this time :)
2013-11-15T19:19:19 <Justin_o> i'm heading offline now.. have a good weekend everyone
2013-11-15T19:22:53 <anastasiac> looks good so far, Justin_o, nice work. Have a great weekend!

2013-11-15T13:18:44 <Bosmon7> Hi there Justin_o
2013-11-15T13:18:46 <Bosmon7> Are you there?
2013-11-15T13:20:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello.. i\'m here
2013-11-15T13:20:49 <Bosmon7> cool
2013-11-15T13:20:50 <Justin_o> i was just going to ping you :)
2013-11-15T13:21:07 <Bosmon7> I am just off travelling in a bit but I will be around later in the day again
2013-11-15T13:21:26 <Bosmon7> But I wanted to point towards a futher possibility for working around your model listener priority issue
2013-11-15T13:21:42 <Bosmon7> It appears that a combination of the techniques we tried yesterday might be effective
2013-11-15T13:21:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m still trying to sort through that issue i was talking to you about yesterday.. unfortunately the plan we had discussed yesterday didn\'t work because they were still firing ahead of time. I\'ve found that if i individually bind listeners to onCreate to addListeners for each model path, they fire at the correct time.. but i\'m running into a very
2013-11-15T13:21:58 <Justin_o> strange issue that is preventing it from working still.
2013-11-15T13:22:06 <Justin_o> oh okay.... maybe that will be better then
2013-11-15T13:22:30 <Bosmon7> In particular, if you use the old-style, non-declarative scheme for attaching model listeners, there is a place in the record where you can enter a "priority" annotation and have it honoured
2013-11-15T13:22:32 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/tests/framework-tests/core/js/DataBindingTests.js#L345-L346
2013-11-15T13:22:53 <Bosmon7> In these lines in the data binding test, you can see that the first argument to ChangeApplier\'s addListener can accept a record in addition to just a path
2013-11-15T13:22:59 <Bosmon7> I mean, in place of just a path
2013-11-15T13:23:14 <Bosmon7> And in this record there is a "priority" field that will be passed through to the underlying firer
2013-11-15T13:24:22 <Bosmon7> Although this example shows an addition to "guards", the same is also true of "modelChanged"
2013-11-15T13:24:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: oh great.. thanks for digging that out.. i\'ll give that a shot.
2013-11-15T13:24:45 * anastasiac joined the channel
2013-11-15T13:25:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: from the look of it, it should solve the problem..

2013-11-15T13:33:19 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - great - we survive that attempt on our life : P
2013-11-15T13:33:38 <Bosmon7> I\'ll try to hurry up the work on the new ChangeApplier now that it seems we are running into these problems urgently....
2013-11-15T13:35:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :) thanks... i am looking forward to the new framework features and a new renderer :) but i guess that ones still a long ways off
2013-11-15T13:36:15 <Bosmon7> We should hopefully have something a bit like a new renderer in the spring...
2013-11-15T13:36:31 <Bosmon7> I imagine that, like the model relay system, the old and new implementations will coexist for a while
2013-11-15T13:36:58 <Bosmon7> When my work is merged in, we will have access to both the old ChangeApplier and the new one under different grade names, so that we can migrate our work over gradually
2013-11-15T13:37:03 <Justin_o> makes sense.. so we can migrate over time
2013-11-15T13:37:23 <Justin_o> that seems very practical

2013-11-15T16:23:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i tried this many different ways, but nothing seems to work. I even resorted to using a single onCreate event which would trigger the creation of a single listener to any model change event and had a handler function that would then determine which path was fired. This was attached directly to the composite panel without using dynamic grades and it
2013-11-15T16:23:23 <Justin_o> still fired too early. So it seems that my earlier hypothesis that these types of events would fire at the appropriate time was wrong. There also might be an issue with binding multiple change applier events with addListener from a dynamic grade, but it could also have been related to other things i was testing at the time. At any rate none of these worked,
2013-11-15T16:23:23 <Justin_o> even when setting the priority as you suggested today.
2013-11-15T16:25:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: I was able to fix the issue though.. it turned out to be relative easy in comparison. I changed the tree rebasing to source values for value fields, associated with valuebinding, from the composite panels model instead. I don\'t know if this would have an issue with valuebinding source from an IoC reference though.. so this may not be foolproof

2013-11-15T17:43:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: do you mean the problem with rendering more than one adjusters in pmt? chris sent me a pull request this morning and it fixed that problem. seems it was \'cuz those adjuster containers are in a hidden div.
2013-11-15T17:44:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. strange okay.. but we should be careful about it coming up again i guess
2013-11-15T17:44:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: what was the problem with them being in a hidden div?
2013-11-15T17:44:50 <cindyli> certainly
2013-11-15T17:45:24 * michelled has quit
2013-11-15T17:46:03 <cindyli> Justin_o: when more than one adjusters were to be rendered in the hidden div, the whole markup would somehow be wiped out, which leads to an unfound adjuster container
2013-11-15T17:46:25 <cindyli> i\'m still puzzled why one can be rendered fine but not more than one
2013-11-15T17:46:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: any idea why there being hidden is part of the issue?
2013-11-15T17:46:57 <cindyli> no idea yet :(
