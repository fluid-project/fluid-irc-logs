2013-12-04T17:33:41 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the md elements that aren\'t in the spec yet: They\'ve been cleaning up the wiki, that\'s why they\'re not mentioned anymore. They are discussed on the Issues page, here:  http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility/Issues_Tracker
2013-12-04T17:33:54 <anastasiac> I\'ll help translate that into an actual draft spec, but I\'m on a call right now
2013-12-04T17:40:52 <jhung> Great thanks!

2013-12-04T18:58:36 <jhung> anastasiac: in http://schema.org/VideoObject is the caption property intended to contain the entire caption for video or just a boolean? Maybe a URL? It\'s unclear as its usage in this case.

2013-12-04T19:30:27 <anastasiac> jhung, good question. I have no idea. Its datatype is Text, whereas they do have an URL datatype, so I suspect it\'s not an url to a "caption" file. I suspect it\'s "caption" in the sense of "short descriptive text positioned under the thing" ? maybe?
2013-12-04T19:30:46 <anastasiac> jhung, it\'s also used on ImageObject
2013-12-04T19:31:27 <jhung> anastasiac: yeah. But I also see that for our purposes, we\'re better off uding the mediaFeatures property. Should we be concerned that it is draft and not final?
2013-12-04T19:31:37 <jhung> *using, not uding.
2013-12-04T19:32:40 <anastasiac> jhung, mediaFeature \xe2\x80\x93 now called accessibilityFeature \xe2\x80\x93 is no longer a draft. It\'s official!
2013-12-04T19:32:57 <anastasiac> as of v1.0e
2013-12-04T19:33:03 <anastasiac> announced today
2013-12-04T19:35:49 <jhung> anastasiac: ah I understand now. I was expecting schema.org to define the values for accessibilityFeature. I think I get how this will all work now. :)
2013-12-04T19:36:24 <anastasiac> no, actually, these new a11y properties are the first to have externally defined "recommended" vocabularies, jhung
2013-12-04T19:36:52 <jhung> gotcha anastasiac
2013-12-04T19:37:13 <danaayotte> fluid-everyone: we will be starting the community meeting in a few minutes - today is the open design review where we will be discussing the latest metadata authoring designs
2013-12-04T19:38:36 <jhung> Justin_o: can you use Google Hangout or Adobe Connect so I can get video?
2013-12-04T19:39:08 <Justin_o> jhung: hmm.. maybe... i\'ll see what we can do
2013-12-04T19:39:27 <jhung> thanks Justin_o

2013-12-04T20:17:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you happen to know a good pretty printing library for html written in js

2013-12-04T20:17:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t - but what exactly do you mean by pretty printing
2013-12-04T20:18:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s an example
2013-12-04T20:18:29 <Bosmon> Do you mean for dumping to the console
2013-12-04T20:18:37 <Justin_o> i have <div><span>test</span></div>
2013-12-04T20:18:40 <Justin_o> but i want it to look like
2013-12-04T20:18:54 <Justin_o> <div>
2013-12-04T20:18:54 <Justin_o> <span>test</span>
2013-12-04T20:18:54 <Justin_o> </div>
2013-12-04T20:19:35 <Justin_o> i\'m making a markup viewer so that you can view the source of the editor in another window.. currently it all looks minified
2013-12-04T20:19:49 <Bosmon> ok
2013-12-04T20:20:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ve tried using https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/wiki/GettingStarted but it seems to be stripping out the text nodes that aren\'t wrapped in a tag
2013-12-04T20:21:33 <Justin_o> i guess i could wrap it in some element ahead of time..
