2013-11-06T21:08:23 <colinclark> hey yzen
2013-11-06T21:08:34 <yzen> colinclark: hi
2013-11-06T21:08:42 <colinclark> I\'m confused about this directory: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/deviceReporter
2013-11-06T21:08:48 <colinclark> Fascinatingly, so was kasparnet
2013-11-06T21:09:11 <colinclark> which one of these files actually represents the thing the mock Device Reporter returns?
2013-11-06T21:11:21 <yzen> colinclark: it\'s a combination of isntalledSolutions.json and the actual platform info
2013-11-06T21:11:37 <colinclark> so the only file that is actually used, in practice, is installedSolutions.json?
2013-11-06T21:11:50 <yzen> yes in current configurations yes
2013-11-06T21:12:10 <colinclark> And installedSolutions.json contains both Windows and Linux solutions
2013-11-06T21:12:40 <colinclark> Are these all reported back, or are the non-platform-appropriate solutions somehow stripped out of the response?
2013-11-06T21:12:53 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-11-06T21:12:56 <yzen> colinclark: all back i bet
2013-11-06T21:13:10 <yzen> hence the platform specific file, we don\'t actually use them
2013-11-06T21:13:21 <colinclark> ok
2013-11-06T21:13:27 <colinclark> I\'m going to remove all the platform-specific files
2013-11-06T21:13:32 <yzen> ok
2013-11-06T21:13:36 <colinclark> moving only the linux one to the "examples" directory
2013-11-06T21:13:55 <colinclark> since I assume it reflects a realistic picture of what a consumer of the Device Reporter would expect to get back as a response, right?
2013-11-06T21:16:42 <colinclark> yzen: ^
2013-11-06T21:16:45 <yzen> yes that sounds right
2013-11-06T21:16:55 <colinclark> ok, cool
2013-11-06T21:16:56 <colinclark> Another question for you:
2013-11-06T21:17:03 <colinclark> I\'ve asked you this a million times, I know
2013-11-06T21:17:04 <colinclark> sorry
2013-11-06T21:17:26 <colinclark> But if I make a PUT request to the Preferences Server with a new preference set, will it generate me a user token?
2013-11-06T21:17:29 <colinclark> Or do I have to specify it?
2013-11-06T21:17:52 <yzen> colinclark: it will generate one
2013-11-06T21:18:09 <colinclark> What should the request look like, if I make, say, a curl request?
2013-11-06T21:20:57 <yzen> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" {url ot pref server}/user/{optional token} -d @filename
2013-11-06T21:21:05 <yzen> or instead of @filename actual json
2013-11-06T21:21:06 <yzen> string
2013-11-06T21:39:12 <colinclark> awesome, yzen
2013-11-06T21:39:13 <colinclark> thanks
2013-11-06T21:39:21 <yzen> did it worK ?

2013-11-06T15:35:13 <colinclark> anastasiac, Justin_o: Do we have any good examples, tutorials, or documentation about how to do internationalization with Infusion?
2013-11-06T15:36:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: we have this for the preferences framework http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Localization+in+the+Preferences+Framework
2013-11-06T15:36:14 * vjoanna joined the channel
2013-11-06T15:36:25 <anastasiac> colinclark, I think the best (only?) thing we have right now is actually the localization docs for the preferences framework. The way the framework handles it has changed recently, and the prefs framework docs are the most up-to-date
2013-11-06T15:36:47 <colinclark> How about example code or a good place to look at how we\'ve done it?
2013-11-06T15:37:05 <anastasiac> the starter panels all use message bundles
2013-11-06T15:37:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac, colinclark: just so you know.. the stringBundle method only works in the panels..
2013-11-06T15:37:21 <anastasiac> but I don\'t believe we have any examples showing them in another language, for example
2013-11-06T15:37:29 <anastasiac> and Justin_o: oh! good to know :-)
2013-11-06T15:37:36 <colinclark> Someone in Sakai seems to be asking how to do it generally with Infusion
2013-11-06T15:37:44 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you know if there are plans to move that functionality into the framework proper?
2013-11-06T15:37:44 <colinclark> probably not making a preference editor per se
2013-11-06T15:37:54 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-11-06T15:37:54 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i guess that should be preferences framework, not panels, but it doesn\'t extend beyond there yet
2013-11-06T15:37:55 <colinclark> though this documentation is looking really hot
2013-11-06T15:38:02 <anastasiac> yeah, that\'s something we\'re lacking, colinclark
2013-11-06T15:38:05 <colinclark> ok
2013-11-06T15:38:10 <anastasiac> colinclark, do you know if they\'re working with master, or 1.4?
2013-11-06T15:38:10 <colinclark> any good sample code you\'d point someone to?
2013-11-06T15:38:12 <colinclark> in our demos
2013-11-06T15:38:14 <colinclark> probably 1.4
2013-11-06T15:38:18 <colinclark> but who knows?
2013-11-06T15:38:22 <anastasiac> hm
2013-11-06T15:38:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: not sure if it will move to the framework generally.. maybe bosmon will have thoughts on that
2013-11-06T15:38:40 <anastasiac> I suspect our examples are (shamefully) not actually written to be very internationalizable
2013-11-06T15:39:27 <anastasiac> we really should fix that, and create a demo for internationalization, and document how to do it
2013-11-06T15:39:31 <colinclark> How about components out in the wild?
2013-11-06T15:39:31 <Justin_o> colinclark, anastasiac: do either of you know if you can namespace modelListeners
2013-11-06T15:39:41 <anastasiac> I will file some JIRAs
2013-11-06T15:39:46 <anastasiac> in the wild\xe2\x80\xa6 hm
2013-11-06T15:39:46 <colinclark> ok, cool
2013-11-06T15:40:02 <colinclark> Justin_o: I don\'t see why not
2013-11-06T15:40:04 <anastasiac> but colinclark, I don\'t know how soon any docs/demos will actually be created
2013-11-06T15:40:12 <colinclark> yup, I totally understand that
2013-11-06T15:40:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m wondering how because you specify paths.. so i would imagine that "event.namespace" wouldn\'t work for it
2013-11-06T15:41:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: perhaps i\'ll have to create an array and use a namespace property in each object
2013-11-06T15:41:11 <colinclark> Justin_o: Check the unit tests; that\'s often the first place I go to see what\'s "supported" in the sense of verified and tested
2013-11-06T15:41:28 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah.. i checked.. i couldn\'t see a use of namespaces there for modelListeners
2013-11-06T15:41:37 <colinclark> ok
2013-11-06T15:41:48 <colinclark> I\'m guessing Bosmon might resurface later
2013-11-06T15:41:56 <colinclark> he\'s in England, so up early for once
2013-11-06T15:41:59 <colinclark> you could ask him
2013-11-06T15:42:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay.. thanks
2013-11-06T15:42:07 <Justin_o> ah cool.. so i might see him before i leave then
2013-11-06T15:42:17 <Justin_o> do you know if he\'s planning on coming to the community meetings?

2013-11-06T17:02:38 <colinclark> danaayotte and vjoanna, I have a quick question about the notion of "accounts" for our current iteration of the PMT/PCP
2013-11-06T17:03:03 <danaayotte> ok
2013-11-06T17:03:08 <colinclark> From looking at the wireframes, it looks like we don\'t have any kind of account creation included, which I think is good
2013-11-06T17:03:09 <colinclark> is that correct?
2013-11-06T17:03:39 <colinclark> Just the "to apply preferences on other devices, save this token\xe2\x80\xa6" screen, right?
2013-11-06T17:03:45 * michelled joined the channel
2013-11-06T17:04:33 <danaayotte> yes, for pilot we got rid of account creation
2013-11-06T17:04:45 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the localization docs contain a note at the top saying they haven\'t been updated to reflect a recent change. Did the edits you made make that note invalid?
2013-11-06T17:05:18 <Justin_o> yes.. i think you can take that down now
2013-11-06T17:05:27 <anastasiac> k, thanks
2013-11-06T17:07:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: feel free to work your magic on my changes

2013-11-06T17:36:31 <anastasiac> Justin_o, on the localization page, is the diagram still accurate and helpful?
2013-11-06T17:37:52 <anastasiac> e.g. is ".msgBundle" still correct? are there different things that should be mentions (e.g. .stringsBundle)?
2013-11-06T17:38:41 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-11-06T17:39:01 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i guess we could add stringBundles.. the other things should be correct i believe
2013-11-06T17:39:28 <Justin_o> anastasiac: oh and the slidingPanel now added a messageResolver but not sure that needs to be in the diagram
2013-11-06T17:39:39 <anastasiac> so there are both "msgBundle" and "stringBundle"
2013-11-06T17:40:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes.. somewhat confusing eh..
2013-11-06T17:40:21 <anastasiac> what\'s the difference, Justin_o?
2013-11-06T17:42:14 * thealphanerd has quit
2013-11-06T17:42:52 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the stringBundle is basically a little component attached to the panel or other thing that uses it.. and it takes in a messageResolver and the stringArrayIndex
2013-11-06T17:42:54 <Justin_o> here\'s the code
2013-11-06T17:42:55 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L27-L58
2013-11-06T17:43:13 <Justin_o> i guess it\'s not really a component but a grade
2013-11-06T17:43:20 <Justin_o> and it adds some functions
2013-11-06T17:43:57 <Justin_o> it works and is attached similar to the way that the dom member is added to viewComponents

2013-11-06T17:44:41 <anastasiac> so the thing called msgBundle is actually the message resolver, and the thing called stringBundle is a tool for accessing the messages, is that a semi-reasonable summary, Justin_o?
2013-11-06T17:45:25 <anastasiac> Justin_o, is it too late for me to suggest alternate names for these things? :-)
2013-11-06T17:45:57 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes for the summary, no for the names
2013-11-06T17:46:17 <Justin_o> anastasiac: if you want to change the names, just write up a jira. We should probably do it before 1.5 if we can
2013-11-06T17:54:18 <anastasiac> Justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5207  Again, I\'m not sure if it\'s a blocker, but I\'ve made it one so we don\'t forget to decide whether or not it is one.
