2013-11-01T12:17:02 <colinclark> Hey kasparnet, do the acceptance tests all pass for you on Windows?
2013-11-01T12:17:32 <colinclark> On your 32 bit version?
2013-11-01T12:17:38 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah
2013-11-01T12:17:48 <colinclark> like right now they do?
2013-11-01T12:18:28 <colinclark> I was reading through them on Windows, as I get ready for my "ditch font size" pull request
2013-11-01T12:18:48 <colinclark> How come this one, which seems to be testing the SPI handler among other things, is named "os_gnome"? https://github.com/colinbdclark/windows/blob/master/tests/AcceptanceTests.js#L326
2013-11-01T12:19:13 <colinclark> is it just a cut and paste sort of thing, or are these tests actually cross-platform somehow?
2013-11-01T12:20:03 * yzen joined the channel
2013-11-01T12:20:34 <kasparnet> they are... we have the inverse transformations from pilot 1
2013-11-01T12:20:41 <kasparnet> so they should actually work

2013-11-01T12:33:43 * michelled joined the channel
2013-11-01T12:36:29 <colinclark> kasparnet: OOOH, I get it. "os_gnome" is the preference set name, and you\'re actually reverse-transforming from app-specific on GNOME to common terms to Windows
2013-11-01T12:36:30 <colinclark> nice
2013-11-01T12:36:45 <kasparnet> yeah, exactly

2013-11-01T12:57:54 <cindyli> chrispetsos: what\'s the problem
2013-11-01T13:00:11 <chrispetsos> cindyli: hi, it\'s not a particular problem, i\'d just ask for a recommendation on something
2013-11-01T13:01:08 <chrispetsos> cindyli: basically, i\'ve created a new reusable adjuster which i have used twice, you can see a demo here, http://160.40.60.238/prefsEditors/demos/adjustersPilots2/ (temp link)
2013-11-01T13:01:47 <cindyli> looks great
2013-11-01T13:03:03 <chrispetsos> cindyli: what i want to do now is to use this adjuster for a composite one, http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/adjusters-for2ndpilots.pdf, scroll all the way down, at the
2013-11-01T13:03:13 <chrispetsos> cindyli: "Magnifier location follows:"
2013-11-01T13:03:49 <cindyli> i see it
2013-11-01T13:04:00 <chrispetsos> cindyli: till now we have been using the repeatingSelector method for these, I wanted to ask if we could some way use the composite panel you have been working on
2013-11-01T13:04:11 * greggy joined the channel
2013-11-01T13:04:45 <chrispetsos> cindyli: The reason for this is not to maintain the markup in two different places
2013-11-01T13:05:01 <chrispetsos> cindyli: so, do you have a suggestion on how that could be implemented?
2013-11-01T13:08:55 <cindyli> yes, we should be able to use composite panel for this. the only thing needs attention is, each of these "follows" has a different label icon. if you are thinking to use css to achieve that, the customized css can be passed in as an option in aux schema
2013-11-01T13:13:18 <cindyli> chrispetsos: anastasiac found a bug yesterday (http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5203) that options from subpanels are not handled properly in some cases. So, you may have problem implementing what you want by using composite panels with the current infusion lib in gpii repo. we will update the gpii infusion once all major issues with composite panels are addressed.
2013-11-01T13:17:41 <chrispetsos> cindyli: ok, so it would be better if i used the "repeatingSelector" method for the time being
2013-11-01T13:17:53 <cindyli> yes, chrispetsos
2013-11-01T13:18:11 <chrispetsos> ok cindyli thanks

2013-11-01T15:29:31 <anastasiac> yzen, regarding the pageBuilder stuff, one thing that\'s not clear to me at all is: what are the general circumstances in which someone would want to configure the pageBuilder in some way other than the default, and how should they go about doing that? (ok, that\'s two things)
2013-11-01T15:30:25 <anastasiac> if you have thought, yzen, could you add them to the etherpad?
2013-11-01T15:30:26 <yzen> anastasiac: so for example if you want to add a top level component on the page, like sidebar or header or configure it
2013-11-01T15:31:00 <yzen> since page builder contains all components, the options, or new components must be passed as the options to the page builder
2013-11-01T15:31:24 <anastasiac> and where would I do the work of adding a new sidebar?
2013-11-01T15:31:48 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-11-01T15:32:05 <yzen> anastasiac: so that would be done through a config file
2013-11-01T15:32:26 <anastasiac> modifications of an existing config file, or a new one? and how would I tell the page builder about the new file?
2013-11-01T15:34:13 <yzen> so changes would be in a tenant specific config file for example:
2013-11-01T15:34:14 <yzen> https://github.com/collectionspace/ui/tree/master/src/main/webapp/tenants/lifesci/config
2013-11-01T15:34:18 <yzen> app layer handles the overlay
2013-11-01T15:34:25 <yzen> e.g. loads the correct config for a tenant
2013-11-01T15:34:30 <yzen> if there is one
2013-11-01T15:34:37 * colinclark has quit
2013-11-01T15:34:41 <yzen> otherwise the ones in default directory are used\\
2013-11-01T15:36:06 <anastasiac> yzen, do you know if this kind of tenant-specific configuration (in general) is already documented somewhere on their wiki?
2013-11-01T15:36:26 <yzen> anastasiac: i would hope so, I mean it\'s not on our list is it ?
2013-11-01T15:36:35 <anastasiac> no, thanks goodness!
2013-11-01T15:36:41 <yzen> k
2013-11-01T15:36:43 <anastasiac> ok, I\'ll look around there

2013-11-01T19:35:05 <anastasiac> cindyli, I just wanted to double-check with you: Before we introduced composite panels, we had the two links controls checkboxes in one panel; two preferences in one panel. We still support that, right?
2013-11-01T19:35:56 <cindyli> yes, we do, anastasiac
