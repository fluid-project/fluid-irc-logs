2013-09-03T13:43:58 <jhung> Justin_o: is it safe to say that GPII-172 and GPII-178 won't be fixed this iteration? I was wondering if they should be moved to a different section or removed completely on the DT iteration planning page?
2013-09-03T13:45:08 <Justin_o> jhung: that's probably correct.. unless vjoanna makes them higher priority.. I guess we can move it off now and bring them back if need be
2013-09-03T13:46:22 <jhung> So remove them from the page Justin_o or should we just create a new section for unscheduled issues?
2013-09-03T13:47:37 <Justin_o> jhung: i think we've been removing things from the page.. They are still in jira so we can look there for the full list.. perhaps we should put a link to jira where all the DT issues are
2013-09-03T13:48:33 <jhung> Ok Justin_o I'll do both.
2013-09-03T13:48:40 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
