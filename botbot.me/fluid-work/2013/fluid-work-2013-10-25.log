2013-10-25T18:45:46 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, right now the component that connects prefs editor and panels is called "fluid.prefs.prefsEditorConnections", since we are adding another connection component for enactors and prefs editor, which I\'m calling it "fluid.prefs.enactorConnections". do you mind I rename the one for panels to "fluid.prefs.panelConnections"?
2013-10-25T18:46:49 <anastasiac> cindyli, that makes sense to me \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0they should have consistent names, and panels/enactors makes a bit more sense than editors/uiEnhancer, I think. maybe
2013-10-25T18:47:50 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2013-10-25T18:47:58 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\'m thinking about the name now
2013-10-25T18:48:14 <anastasiac> it\'s a grade we "add to" a panel, to say that we want it connected to the prefs editor
2013-10-25T18:48:30 <cindyli> that\'s right
2013-10-25T18:48:31 <anastasiac> or a grade we add to the enactor, to connect it to the uiEnhancer
2013-10-25T18:48:33 <anastasiac> hm
2013-10-25T18:49:18 <anastasiac> cindyli, sorry, I\'m not trying to be difficult, but I\'m not sure which way to name them now :-)
2013-10-25T18:49:54 <cindyli> the one for enactors is to connect enactors with uiEnhancer. the one for panels is to connect panels with prefsEditor
2013-10-25T18:50:06 <cindyli> anastasiac: ^
2013-10-25T18:51:07 <cindyli> ah, sounds making sense to call them "fluid.prefs.prefsEditorConnections" and "fluid.prefs.uiEnhancerConnections"
2013-10-25T18:58:11 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-10-25T19:04:47 <anastasiac> cindyli and Justin_o, regarding the idea of changing the name "fluid.prefs.prefsEditor" to "fluid.prefs.editor" - I searched the integration code I\'m writing, and it\'s interesting. I only use that actual grade name once, and only in the grades version of the integration; if you\'re using schemas, you never explicitly use that grade
2013-10-25T19:05:25 <anastasiac> and in the grades version, you do use "{prefsEditor}.x" a bit, and that actually looks a wee bit more clear than "{editor}.x" might
2013-10-25T19:05:58 <anastasiac> so I\'m actually leaning toward recommending we leave it as it is
2013-10-25T19:06:02 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks for looking into that.. i guess we should leave it then.. the only other question then is what to call the full stack
2013-10-25T19:06:14 <anastasiac> ah, yes, that question still remains
2013-10-25T19:06:29 <anastasiac> perhaps we could call it "fullStack" ? ;-)

2013-10-25T19:49:51 <Bosmon> cindyli, Justin_o - I have just merged in your branch now for FLUID-5131
2013-10-25T19:49:53 <Bosmon> Great work!
2013-10-25T19:50:24 <cindyli> super!!! thanks, Bosmon
2013-10-25T19:52:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - as for the TextfieldSlider "modelPath" work - would this not be better done by using the ModelRelay system that you already wrote?
2013-10-25T19:53:01 <Bosmon> If you were to move it over to this, it would be closer to the implementation we had once model relay goes into the framework proper
2013-10-25T19:53:14 <Bosmon> I am speaking of your FLUID-5190 work, pull request 424
2013-10-25T19:54:05 <cindyli> umm.. let me try, Bosmon
2013-10-25T19:54:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool!
2013-10-25T19:54:40 <Bosmon> I think the modelRelay that you have written is already good enough for this
2013-10-25T19:55:05 <Bosmon> And its configuration and general idiom is mostly compatible with the modelRelay we will have soon
2013-10-25T19:55:18 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-10-25T19:55:18 <Bosmon> In general we will abolish the "modelPath" system wherever we find it once this happens
2013-10-25T19:55:34 <cindyli> sounds reasonable
2013-10-25T20:08:59 <cindyli> Bosmon: after experimenting a bit, i rmb why I didn\'t use model relay. the goal of 5190 is to allow integrators to save sliding value to any path names they want. rules required by the model relay needs to specify the internal model path. if a random name is chosen, how does  textfieldSlider know which model path to listen?
2013-10-25T20:10:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - the idea is that textfieldSlider will use a fixed path internally, and will then be supplied configuration to bind its internal path to an external path via modelRelay
2013-10-25T20:10:24 <Bosmon> So - instead of configuration the option named "modelPath", users will instead configure the modelRelay belonging to the textfieldSlider
2013-10-25T20:10:26 <Bosmon> Does that make sense?
2013-10-25T20:11:36 <cindyli> well, anastasia is offline, we had a discussion yesterday in the channel regarding ur question of "Does that make sense". :) let me find out
2013-10-25T20:12:23 <cindyli> Bosmon: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/fluid-work+IRC+Logs-2013-10-24, from 12:53:25 onwards
2013-10-25T20:26:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - do you feel that this discussion still makes sense? : P
2013-10-25T20:26:56 <Bosmon> I don\'t see anything in it that has a bearing on whether to use modelRelay for this application or not.....
2013-10-25T20:28:27 <cindyli> Bosmon: with model relay, when textfield slider is used, there are 2 requirements: 1. it\'s inside a wrapper component; 2. the internal path is "value"
2013-10-25T20:28:54 <cindyli> anastasia mentioned yesterday in the channel: it\'s going to feel very weird to write documentation that says "you can call your model field whatever you like, unless you\'re using our textfieldSlider, then you must use \'value\'"
2013-10-25T20:30:39 <cindyli> i guess whether using model relay makes more sense is depending on how integrators are going to use text field slider, or anastasia\'s use case, perhaps
2013-10-25T20:32:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - 1. No wrapper component is required, since modelRelay is a mixin grade of the textfieldSlider itself, 2. The entire purpose of ModelRelay is to abstract over whatever the internal path is to a model field
2013-10-25T20:32:41 <Bosmon> anastasia\'s comment misses the point that the author of a component *always* calls their model field whatever they like, and the purpose of ModelRelay is to ensure that the integrator of the component in addition gets to call their model field whatever *they* like .......
2013-10-25T20:34:01 <Bosmon> The "modelPath" system was only ever a poor man\'s proxy for the modelRelay system
2013-10-25T20:34:09 <Bosmon> As indeed, was the historical "shared object reference" system........
2013-10-25T20:39:49 <cindyli> i see your point, Bosmon. i will talk over with anastasia on Monday to see if it satisfies her needs
