2013-11-11T15:27:18 <jhernandez> yzen: now I am working on a new pull request for android, but meanwhile ...
2013-11-11T15:27:40 <yzen> jhernandez: drinking my americano
2013-11-11T15:28:00 <jhernandez> do you have any idea about how to use a local preferences server while running my own cloudBased flowmanager?
2013-11-11T15:28:03 <jhernandez> heh
2013-11-11T15:28:09 <jhernandez> enjoy your americano! ;)
2013-11-11T15:35:23 * vjoanna joined the channel
2013-11-11T15:42:39 <yzen> jhernandez: yes you can totally do that
2013-11-11T15:42:51 <yzen> so you d need to deploy the pref server locally as a separate instance
2013-11-11T15:43:21 <yzen> and then just change the url to the pref server in the cloud based config for the flow manager to point to you server e.g. the right ip and the port number
2013-11-11T15:46:47 <jhernandez> ooook
2013-11-11T15:47:01 <jhernandez> will try that in a few minutes
2013-11-11T15:47:03 <jhernandez> :]
2013-11-11T15:47:32 <jhernandez> btw, I have another question related to the cloudBased flowmanager
2013-11-11T15:49:04 <jhernandez> by following the example on the wiki page (asking for linux\'s magnifier stuff for carla) I am getting {} as the response
2013-11-11T15:50:19 <jhernandez> but when I do the same, but with os_gnome N&P set, I\'m getting the settings without any problem
2013-11-11T15:50:26 <jhernandez> am I missing something?
2013-11-11T16:00:40 <yzen> jhernandez: my guess is that yes :), well there are a couple things to be aware: apps you are requesting have to be in the profile and the installed solutions
2013-11-11T16:21:04 <jhernandez> well, AFAIK, carla has specific settings for the linux magnifier
2013-11-11T16:21:06 * jhernandez checks
2013-11-11T16:21:46 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/carla.json#L25
2013-11-11T16:26:31 <yzen> and what\'s the url you are trying ?
2013-11-11T16:29:54 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you know what the alternative to using guards in the change applier is?
2013-11-11T16:30:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o, no, I don\'t know of any new alternative. I was under the impression that the "guard" functionality is basically no longer available, but I could easily be wrong
2013-11-11T16:31:02 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. thanks
2013-11-11T16:31:29 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i vaguely remember something about model transformations replacing it in the future, but not sure...
2013-11-11T16:31:54 <anastasiac> hm. I\'d be interested in learning how that would work, Justin_o :-)
2013-11-11T16:32:27 <jhernandez> yzen: for os_gnome, http://localhost:8081/os_gnome/settings/%7B%22OS%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22linux%22%7D%2C%22solutions%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier%22%7D%5D%7D
2013-11-11T16:32:37 <jhernandez> for carla, http://localhost:8081/carla/settings/%7B%22OS%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22linux%22%7D%2C%22solutions%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier%22%7D%5D%7D
2013-11-11T16:33:08 <Justin_o> anastasiac: me too.. :) i don\'t think that stuff has been fully implemented yet though.
2013-11-11T16:34:33 <jhernandez> yzen: ok, now realising about the problem
2013-11-11T16:34:45 <yzen> tell me :)
2013-11-11T16:34:58 <jhernandez> carla is out of date, http://preferences.gpii.net/user/carla
2013-11-11T16:35:11 <jhernandez> or at least, is different from our universal\'s carla
2013-11-11T16:35:37 <yzen> :) woohoo
2013-11-11T16:35:45 <yzen> i new it\'s your fault :)
2013-11-11T16:35:48 <yzen> knew
2013-11-11T16:36:04 <jhernandez> damn you JURA!

2013-11-11T21:14:41 <anastasiac> yzen, have you had a chance to look at that cspace page yet?
2013-11-11T21:20:20 <yzen> looks really good, anastasiac
2013-11-11T21:20:38 <anastasiac> no lies, yzen? nothing missing?
2013-11-11T21:20:49 <yzen> in the first paragraph there\'s only a duplicate \'based on\'
2013-11-11T21:21:10 <yzen> it looks like that\'s what they are asking for i think
2013-11-11T21:21:18 <yzen> definitely worth running it passed them
