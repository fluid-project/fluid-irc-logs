2013-11-26T15:48:33 <clown> better than codin jave byte code, I guess, jhernandez
2013-11-26T15:48:38 <clown> *coding java
2013-11-26T15:49:10 <clown> jhernandez:  Just checking to see if you got my email about what I \'ve been up to.  No pressure...

2013-11-26T15:51:18 <jhernandez> clown: got it
2013-11-26T15:51:54 <clown> jhernandez, cool.  thanks.
2013-11-26T15:52:11 <jhernandez> we\'re focused on pilots, but i should take a rest from it and take a look at it
2013-11-26T15:53:42 <clown> jhernandez, interesting definition of "rest".  :-)
2013-11-26T15:54:35 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-11-26T15:55:19 <jhernandez> well
2013-11-26T15:55:20 <jhernandez> in fact
2013-11-26T15:55:38 <jhernandez> lately, all my rests are like these
2013-11-26T15:55:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: how do we replace the use of demands for contexts.. basically i want to set a listener on the subPanel only when there is a prefsEditor as an ancestor
2013-11-26T15:56:46 <jhernandez> clown: in real life, take a rest is something like "let\'s walk for three hours through the forest", "let\'s build this thing from Ikea", etc ... xDDD
2013-11-26T15:57:44 <cindyli> good question, Justin_o, my first thought was dynamic grades. but how can we detect a prefsEditor as an ancestor in the dynamic grade function?
2013-11-26T15:57:59 <clown> jhernandez, speaking from experience, building things from Ikea is not restful at all.  Quite the opposite, in fact.
2013-11-26T15:58:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. maybe
2013-11-26T15:59:16 <cindyli> Justin_o: ah ha, another solution is to use the distribute option in the prefsEditor
2013-11-26T15:59:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: i was looking at that but it didn\'t work
2013-11-26T15:59:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you want to pair up with me on that?
2013-11-26T16:00:01 <cindyli> sure

2013-11-26T16:59:27 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2013-11-26T16:59:34 <Bosmon> How is the EVENT MANGLING going?
2013-11-26T17:02:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. i think i\'ve gotten something sorted out for that.. trying to use a dynamic grade
2013-11-26T17:02:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m having problems with refactoring that bindEvent function though
2013-11-26T17:03:24 <Bosmon> ok
2013-11-26T17:05:19 * yzen has quit
2013-11-26T17:07:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i ran into a strange issue where the IoC reference in a listener that used a "this" with a reference to a parents dom element wouldn\'t resolve the context
2013-11-26T17:08:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o
2013-11-26T17:08:33 <Bosmon> Can you show more detail on the problem
2013-11-26T17:09:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i cleared out the code to work on a different part, but i can tell you how to recreate it if you like
2013-11-26T17:09:27 <Bosmon> Juston: ....
2013-11-26T17:11:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for example try to move line 266 of SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.js to be declarative by putting it in the prefsEditors options block on line 133 of the same file
2013-11-26T17:13:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you show me how you would do this?
2013-11-26T17:13:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure just be a couple of minutes

2013-11-26T17:36:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry the information i gave you was a bit wrong. It should go into the slidingPanel..
2013-11-26T17:36:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m wondering if it is a problem with the tests though, anastasiac\'s demo is still working
2013-11-26T17:36:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the error i get "Failed to resolve reference {iframeRenderer}.iframe - could not match context with name iframeRenderer from component { typeName: "fluid.slidingPanel" gradeNames: ["fluid.prefs.stringBundle","fluid.slidingPanel"] id: c5yg8fj1-186}[object Object]"
2013-11-26T17:37:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the configuration i use in the slidingPanel subcomponent http://pastie.org/private/8snt4hb3zgcnvmdpelcnia
2013-11-26T17:43:22 * colinclark has quit
2013-11-26T17:45:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this is most likely because, as we discussed yesterday, the iFrameRenderer is createOnEvent for an event which has not occurred yet
2013-11-26T17:48:29 <anastasiac> Justin_o, can I use the new fluid.prefs.create() function to create a full-page editor?
2013-11-26T17:50:24 <michelled> hi Bosmon - yzen mentioned that he needs one of your pull requests to go in so he can complete his work. is it for 5212?
2013-11-26T17:51:23 <Bosmon> 5212, yes
2013-11-26T17:51:30 <Bosmon> Let me just add a tiny adjustment to it
2013-11-26T17:51:35 <Bosmon> Although you can start reading it if you want

2013-11-26T18:00:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you check in a revision of the failing code so I can take a look at it?
2013-11-26T18:00:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ll be able to attend a part of the meeting but I\'ll need to leave early

2013-11-26T18:39:20 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I need to shoot out now, but your issue is caused by the fact that your slidingPanel component has already been destroyed at the point the listener fires
2013-11-26T18:39:32 <Bosmon> That is, when the afterPanelShow event fires
2013-11-26T18:39:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. so it is an issue with the test then
2013-11-26T18:40:17 <Bosmon> When I get back I\'ll put in a proper implementation for http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4890 so that we get better diagnostics in these cases
2013-11-26T18:41:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - actually once I put this detection in, your test case fails much earlier than this point
2013-11-26T18:41:24 <Bosmon> So it appears it is already using a destroyed component during a refreshView method
2013-11-26T18:41:34 <Bosmon> It looks like this will be a very helpful diagnostic : P
2013-11-26T18:41:40 <Bosmon> It may be that this test has always been invalid somehow
2013-11-26T18:41:58 <Bosmon> But that "enough" of the component survived destruction before to responsd to the events well enough
2013-11-26T18:42:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh no.. that\'s scary.. yes.. better diagnostics would be great :)
