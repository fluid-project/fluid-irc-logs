2013-08-28T12:51:11 * mrvisser has quit
2013-08-28T12:51:35 <amilchev> Justin_o: been working on the Speak Text adjuster group and particularly on your comment in the UX mailing list about breaking up one big panel into separate ones - tell me if you remember or should I paste anything?
2013-08-28T12:53:03 <Justin_o> this one? https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-153/src/shared/adjusters/js/speakText.js
2013-08-28T12:53:24 <amilchev> Justin_o: yep
2013-08-28T12:54:08 <amilchev> Justin_o: I created a single panel for each of the adjusters and moved them in this file https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/src/shared/adjusters/js/speakTextPanels.js
2013-08-28T12:54:38 * mbrenn_iskme joined the channel
2013-08-28T12:55:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: now I want to create a big panel, which contains all the small ones, similar to this one: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/StarterGrades.js#L230-L349
2013-08-28T12:56:11 <Justin_o> amilchev:  i like the name of your branch
2013-08-28T12:56:16 <amilchev> :D
2013-08-28T12:56:38 <Justin_o> amilchev: for that second link you sent me, that\'s not really one big panel, it\'s a set of panels.
2013-08-28T12:57:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok, so am I having the right approach?
2013-08-28T12:58:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: close.. i believe what i was suggesting is to have them be separate components that you would combine into a single panel.
2013-08-28T12:59:32 <Justin_o> amilchev: i don\'t really know what this does, but from looking at the code, these could be the same components, with the configuration modified https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/src/shared/adjusters/js/speakTextPanels.js#L3-L35
2013-08-28T13:01:21 <amilchev> Justin_o: once I load the file with the small panels (speakTextPanels.js), all the adjusters are visualized and their models are successfully being saved in the cookie
2013-08-28T13:01:53 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-08-28T13:01:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: so if you stripped off the preferenceMap and generalized the naming, you could boil it down to the common  parts. Then you\'d use this as a couple sub-component instances.
2013-08-28T13:02:04 <Justin_o> amilchev: let me check this out and try to run it..
2013-08-28T13:02:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: run this file in node-webkit https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/demos/speakTextAdjusterGroup/index.html
2013-08-28T13:02:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: thanks
2013-08-28T13:05:21 <Justin_o> amilchev: so i take it that all of the parts are being rendered out as separate panels at the moment
2013-08-28T13:05:39 * greggy joined the channel
2013-08-28T13:05:46 <amilchev> Justin_o: exactly
2013-08-28T13:06:20 <amilchev> Justin_o: how do I go from now on ?
2013-08-28T13:09:03 <amilchev> Justin_o: also, you recommended using that.locate("selectorName").<jQuery function> for the jQuery part - can I define a selector in a SMALL panel, which corresponds to an HTML object in this file https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/src/shared/adjusters/html/newestSpeakText.html
2013-08-28T13:10:38 <Justin_o> amilchev: so it\'s great that you got them all broken down and rendered out, but if you want them all in a single panel, you\'ll have to define them as a single panel. or assemble them as such. I guess you could just merge all the gradeNames together, but you\'d have to take care to manually override the prototree
2013-08-28T13:11:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: not really, with the exception of the panels container, the rest would be out of scope for the component
2013-08-28T13:11:56 * yzen joined the channel
2013-08-28T13:12:09 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you wanted to use the container you would call that.container rather than using locate
2013-08-28T13:12:18 <Justin_o> amilchev: what is it you wanted to get from here?
2013-08-28T13:16:42 <amilchev> Justin_o: I want to show/hide different divs in the newestSpeakText.html basing on the model of some of the components
2013-08-28T13:18:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: I could achieve that with the ugly $(".some-class").<function> ... but I guess that\'s a wrong approach
2013-08-28T13:19:16 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes, you\'d want to avoid that. If you had another similar instance on the page you could affect that one too..
2013-08-28T13:20:04 <amilchev> Justin_o: exactly.. so how do I avoid it ?
2013-08-28T13:21:17 <Justin_o> amilchev: this will be a bit of a pain to configure if you keep these all as separate panels. basically you could technically do this because the panels are all siblings.. so you\'d just call the show/hide on the containers of the panels you want to show/hide. But since you are using the schema you will have to go through and write out all of the configuration in the options block of the grade that is returned\xe2\x80\xa6 the one you are using on li
2013-08-28T13:21:18 <Justin_o> 35 of index.html.
2013-08-28T13:21:33 <Justin_o> and of course it would all be dependent on the schemas used
2013-08-28T13:22:05 <Justin_o> this is another reason why it would be better to have them all in a single panel, as you can make this configuration ahead of time in the panel instead.
2013-08-28T13:24:35 <amilchev> Justin_o: so I should create a big panel, whose grade names are all the small ones and manually work off the protoTree ?
2013-08-28T13:26:37 <Justin_o> amilchev: i guess there are two options that come to mind.. 1) what you just mentioned of merging the panel grades and trying to fix up the protoTree. Although you might run into problems with this since they will all be merged. 2) modify your current individual panels into plain components and assemble these as subcomponents of a single panel

2013-08-28T13:28:00 <Justin_o> amilchev: are you comfortable with either or both of those approaches?
2013-08-28T13:31:34 <amilchev> Justin_o: rather not, I would choose the approach that already has a well-written example (if such exists)
2013-08-28T13:32:22 <amilchev> Justin_o: basically I\'m asking for an advice/direction
2013-08-28T13:33:58 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-08-28T13:35:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: unfortunately i don\'t think there is, our combined cases so far haven\'t been as complex, and you\'ve probably looked at them already.. the textfieldslider and the linksControls panel
2013-08-28T13:35:44 <Justin_o> amilchev: how much later are you going to be working today/
2013-08-28T13:35:46 <Justin_o> ?
2013-08-28T13:38:32 <amilchev> Justin_o: I was about to be leaving soon, but I could stay if I had to, what do you mean
2013-08-28T13:39:20 <Justin_o> amilchev: that\'s okay.. no need.. i\'ll talk things over with some more people here today and perhaps i can make a simple example out of the linkControls panel.
2013-08-28T13:40:05 <amilchev> Justin_o: that\'d be really helpful
2013-08-28T13:41:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: cool.. i\'ll try to get it done today
2013-08-28T13:41:46 <amilchev> Justin_o: hope I don\'t interrupt your work too much (sorry if I do :)
