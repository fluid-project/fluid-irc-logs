b'2013-10-08T19:18:30 <colinclark> 5. We still need to figure out if we\'ve got a subtle problem related to the CSS renaming
2013-10-08T19:18:46 <colinclark> I think michelled is on that latter mission
2013-10-08T19:19:20 <michelled> there is definitely use of uio theme names in the oercommons source
2013-10-08T19:19:45 <michelled> it\'s actually the strategy that we recommend to make a site conform nicely when a theme is chosen
2013-10-08T19:20:11 <colinclark> that\'s exactly what I was afraid of
2013-10-08T19:20:18 <colinclark> Can you also check out they instantiate UIO?
2013-10-08T19:20:32 <colinclark> does it more or less reflect our tutorial, or are they doing anything fancy?
2013-10-08T19:23:03 <Justin_o> sorry about the delay.. my computer decided to lock up for a bit.. probably all the instances of sublime i\'m running
2013-10-08T19:23:11 <Justin_o> http://pastie.org/private/pftaoeghqsg12wn6anjqg
2013-10-08T19:23:12 <colinclark> no worries :)
2013-10-08T19:24:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark, anastasiac: does it look okay?
2013-10-08T19:25:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - something like that, yes - although it might be more helpful if we could get some insight into what the constructed grade name actually is in any case, and guide it to be something helpful
2013-10-08T19:25:27 <anastasiac> it looks lovely
2013-10-08T19:25:40 <Bosmon> I guess by default it will be something like fluid.uiOptions.constructed.something?
2013-10-08T19:25:54 <anastasiac> the constructed grade name is now in the "fluid.prefs.constructed"
2013-10-08T19:26:01 <anastasiac> you get "prefsEditor" and "uio"
2013-10-08T19:26:10 <anastasiac> so "fluid.prefs.constructed.prefsEditor"
2013-10-08T19:26:23 <anastasiac> if you override the namespace with "footer" you can then use "foofer.prefsEditor"
2013-10-08T19:26:40 <anastasiac> s/footer/foofer
2013-10-08T19:27:51 <Bosmon> So perhaps we could achieve fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor?
2013-10-08T19:27:57 <Bosmon> Simply through configuration to the builder?
2013-10-08T19:28:15 <anastasiac> yes, easily
2013-10-08T19:28:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that would be easy
2013-10-08T19:29:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the question would be is that what we\'d want?
2013-10-08T19:29:33 <Bosmon> I think it has some things in its favour
2013-10-08T19:29:45 <Justin_o> i just really mean the name
2013-10-08T19:29:51 <Bosmon> For example, it helps to bridge the gaps between the worlds of users #1 and #2
2013-10-08T19:29:53 <Bosmon> yes
2013-10-08T19:29:54 <Justin_o> i like the 1 less step
2013-10-08T19:30:00 <Bosmon> It is a name that can be "naturally achieved"
2013-10-08T19:30:08 <Bosmon> And so it is clearer to users how they might naturally achieve other things
2013-10-08T19:30:21 <Bosmon> As well as giving them easy access to all the other grade names that are constructed in the same step
2013-10-08T19:31:36 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: are you okay with fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor as the packaged component for the preference framework
2013-10-08T19:31:49 <colinclark> yup, I\'m fine with it
2013-10-08T19:31:59 <colinclark> and other prefsEditors will likely mirror this approach?
2013-10-08T19:32:07 <colinclark> pga.explorationTool.prefsEditor?
2013-10-08T19:32:13 <colinclark> or whatever
2013-10-08T19:32:43 <anastasiac> seems ok to me
2013-10-08T19:32:50 <Justin_o> okay.. i\'ll just reopen FLUID-5161 and we can make the necessary changes
2013-10-08T19:33:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you want to make these changes or would you like me too.. i don\'t mind doing it.. up to you
2013-10-08T19:34:36 <cindyli> Justin_o: go ahead to make changes since you seem to be more clear about all these :)
2013-10-08T19:35:28 <Justin_o> cindyli:  okay :)
2013-10-08T19:36:38 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-08T19:48:04 <michelled> colinclark: in terms of your earlier question, oercommons is mostly following the tutorial. There is one listener being added programatically in the green site, but it should be a simple fix
2013-10-08T19:48:15 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-08T19:48:18 <colinclark> well, there you go
2013-10-08T19:48:26 <colinclark> so the CSS issue isn\'t a trivial one
2013-10-08T19:48:37 <colinclark> Have the stylesheets changed much amidst all this refactoring, Justin_o?
2013-10-08T19:48:41 <michelled> nope, it\'s not
2013-10-08T19:48:46 <colinclark> aside from the names
2013-10-08T19:49:11 * yzen joined the channel
2013-10-08T19:53:13 <colinclark> michelled: do you think it would be crazy to ship two copies of the UIO stylesheets?
2013-10-08T19:53:29 <colinclark> Or doubled definitions of everything, half of them marked deprecated?
2013-10-08T19:58:48 <michelled> I\'d rather see two copies of the stylesheets instead of double definitions
2013-10-08T19:59:12 <michelled> I imagine we could modify the css generation code to generate the two copies
2013-10-08T19:59:36 <michelled> or maybe we should make another build target?
2013-10-08T20:00:07 <colinclark> Either one would be fine
2013-10-08T20:00:43 <colinclark> Despite my typically aggressive "I want to break backwards compatibility" stance these days, I think we should plan for something before we cut 1.5
2013-10-08T20:01:03 <colinclark> I worry that the "accessibility is too hard" set will just see this as further fuel for the fire

b'2013-10-08T18:39:08 <colinclark> wouldn\'t it make sense for them to be able to create "a UIO component" or "a Exploration Tool" component, and get back a thing which has those three elements in it?
2013-10-08T18:39:24 <colinclark> anastasiac: That would be a very good exercise to do, yes!
2013-10-08T18:39:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes.. that\'s what i meant
2013-10-08T18:39:33 <colinclark> ah, cool, Justin_o
2013-10-08T18:39:40 <colinclark> so what barriers are there to doing that?
2013-10-08T18:39:44 <colinclark> just time and effort?
2013-10-08T18:39:49 <colinclark> or are there technical constraints?
2013-10-08T18:39:53 <colinclark> or clarity constraints?
2013-10-08T18:39:55 <colinclark> or something else?
2013-10-08T18:40:10 * clown has quit
2013-10-08T18:40:29 <anastasiac> mostly time constraints, and also "moving target" constraints :-)
2013-10-08T18:40:44 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-08T18:40:59 <anastasiac> but these kinds of integrations typically turn out to be useful excercises
2013-10-08T18:41:16 <colinclark> Justin_o: Answers to those questions from the perspective of providing some kind of an affordance for user #1?
2013-10-08T18:41:19 <anastasiac> would we a) upgrade to the current builder proposal? or b) try creating a component and upgrading to that?
2013-10-08T18:43:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: so we did talk about that.. basically as it stands the only thing that has the whole stack in it, is what is produced by the builder... when using grades the three parts are initialized separates.. so we had two options basically 1) something that looks like what the builder uses
2013-10-08T18:43:16 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Builder.js#L74-L133 or 2) assigning the output of the builder
2013-10-08T18:44:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: the issue with #2 is how to assign that component to fluid.uiOptions while preserving all expected component features.. like being able to call fluid.defaults("fluid.uiOptions") to get it\'s defaults
2013-10-08T18:44:56 <colinclark> Here\'s an idea that might be enlightening for me (and probably boring old news for all of you)...
2013-10-08T18:45:08 <colinclark> Can someone try describing to me in plain English, rather than programmer terminology, what I get back when I call fluid.prefs.builder()?
2013-10-08T18:45:52 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sounds like a job for you :)
2013-10-08T18:47:00 <anastasiac> colinclark: you would get an object that defines two grades that you could instantiate: the "uio" grade and the "uie" grade (using the old terminology; don\'t know what the new is)
2013-10-08T18:47:06 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-08T18:47:14 <anastasiac> if you create the uio thingy, you\'ll get the store, the enhancer and the fat panel
2013-10-08T18:47:24 <anastasiac> if you create the uie, you\'ll get the store and the enhancer
2013-10-08T18:47:37 <anastasiac> the two are also available as functions, not just grades
2013-10-08T18:48:04 <anastasiac> the object will also have a heck of a lot of other stuff in it, but you won\'t care :-)
2013-10-08T18:48:17 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-08T18:48:22 <colinclark> so that\'s fascinating actually
2013-10-08T18:48:29 <colinclark> let me just open up this tutorial again
2013-10-08T18:48:39 <colinclark> "First, we need to add the UI Enhancer component to the page."
2013-10-08T18:48:52 <colinclark> " Finally, we instantiate the UI Options component itself. We do this by calling the creator function\xe2\x80\xa6"
2013-10-08T18:49:19 <anastasiac> if it helps, we have draft docs for the Builder: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Builder
2013-10-08T18:49:19 <colinclark> So does that mean that the output of the Builder corresponds more or less directly to these two actions in the tutorial?
2013-10-08T18:49:38 <anastasiac> yes, with the added bonus of also instantiating the store
2013-10-08T18:49:50 <colinclark> sweet
2013-10-08T18:49:58 <colinclark> Okay, so another boring question
2013-10-08T18:50:39 <colinclark> Would we have been happier, in the old days, if we could have written the tutorial this way:
2013-10-08T18:51:12 <colinclark> "First, we add the <all in one component that represents \'that UI Options component on your page\'> to the page."
2013-10-08T18:51:31 <colinclark> And then, to quote the dorky old Apple commercial
2013-10-08T18:51:45 <colinclark> "Step two? There is no step two!"
2013-10-08T18:51:52 <colinclark> I might be over simplifying
2013-10-08T18:52:01 <colinclark> I\'m just trying to understand what we\'ve got vs. what we had
2013-10-08T18:52:07 <colinclark> it sounds like an improvement to me
2013-10-08T18:52:13 <anastasiac> yes, we would have been happier :-)
2013-10-08T18:52:15 * clown joined the channel
2013-10-08T18:52:27 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2013-10-08T18:52:28 <colinclark> Cool
2013-10-08T18:52:31 <anastasiac> I was arguing for that option during our discussion: "I want one-stop shopping"
2013-10-08T18:52:35 <colinclark> cool
2013-10-08T18:52:39 <colinclark> so we rule, is what you\'re saying
2013-10-08T18:52:42 * jessm has quit
2013-10-08T18:52:43 <colinclark> Justin_o: Guess what?
2013-10-08T18:52:45 <colinclark> you rule!@
2013-10-08T18:52:49 <colinclark> cindyli: Guess what?
2013-10-08T18:52:50 <colinclark> you rule!
2013-10-08T18:53:00 <colinclark> anastasiac, michelled, Bosmon, everyone I\'m forgetting, you rule!
2013-10-08T18:53:35 <anastasiac> the builder is pretty slick
2013-10-08T18:54:00 <colinclark> So, what stops us from defining a component with a real name and grade, for the thing I\'ve been awkwardly calling "<all in one component that represents \'that UI Options component on your page\'>"
2013-10-08T18:54:03 <colinclark> ?
2013-10-08T18:54:14 <colinclark> I guess this may end up being a Bosmon question
2013-10-08T18:54:27 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you want to try to answer that one?
2013-10-08T18:54:35 <colinclark> He has seen, from my recent artwork, that I\'m still largely a stone age Infusion programmer
2013-10-08T18:54:44 <colinclark> with my stone arrowhead init functions
2013-10-08T18:56:20 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. sure.. so i actually put that up here a while back, but i\'ll summarize again.. 1) we use grades and do the configuration in the component, and would look something like the combination of these two grades used in the builder https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Builder.js#L74-L133 2) we use the
2013-10-08T18:56:21 <Justin_o> output of the builder however we probably couldn\'t map it to fluid.uiOptions this way and preserver all of the contract that a typical infusion component would have
2013-10-08T18:56:23 <Bosmon> Better stone arrowhead functions than "arrow functions" : P
2013-10-08T18:57:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: so the issue with 1) is mostly about duplication
2013-10-08T18:57:31 <colinclark> sorry I\'m only now finally catching up to you, Justin_o
2013-10-08T18:57:36 <colinclark> and for making you repeat yourself
2013-10-08T18:58:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: and it was seeming that the work to produce to make the component as well as maintaining seemed to not be worth it given the perceived (although debatable) ease of just using the builder directly as it is in the demo
2013-10-08T18:59:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: although the demo example could be too simplistic i suppose
2013-10-08T19:00:05 <colinclark> I guess some of it is maybe philosophical
2013-10-08T19:00:17 <colinclark> but most of it, I think, is about user-friendliness
2013-10-08T19:00:41 <colinclark> anastasiac\'s responses to the "plain English" questions suggest a perspective we want to try to accommodate
2013-10-08T19:00:44 <colinclark> I think
2013-10-08T19:00:52 <colinclark> I mean, we always have to measure the cost of these things
2013-10-08T19:01:34 <colinclark> but I really can imagine, at one level of usage, that I as a developer, want to get my hands on a thing that I can reliable say IS a UI Options component, or is an Exploration Tool Component, or is a PMT
2013-10-08T19:01:37 <colinclark> and so on
2013-10-08T19:01:55 <colinclark> perhaps I\'m putting too fine a point on it
2013-10-08T19:02:44 <colinclark> but I think anastasiac was saying that 1) she likes that we can teach a user how to do one thing instead of two or three, which we\'ve already accomplished and 2) she\'ll have to do extra work to explain what a builder is and what it produces
2013-10-08T19:02:59 <colinclark> Bosmon: Any thoughts, technically, on what the best way is to accomplish this?
2013-10-08T19:03:09 <colinclark> Do either of Justin_o
2013-10-08T19:03:17 <colinclark> \'s ideas resonate with you?
2013-10-08T19:03:38 <colinclark> michelled: Did you have any look combing through some UIO-using source code for signs of classname trouble?
2013-10-08T19:03:45 <colinclark> "any luck" that is
2013-10-08T19:04:24 <Bosmon> colinclark - could you expand on your question slightly - or, perhaps narrow it?
2013-10-08T19:04:39 <Bosmon> "I want to get my hands on a thing which I can reliably say IS a UI Options component"
2013-10-08T19:04:48 <Bosmon> Which part of this problem would we like to assist with?
2013-10-08T19:05:14 <colinclark> I think Justin\'s explanation deals with the technical problems
2013-10-08T19:06:11 <colinclark> the user experience issue is largely one of providing a user with a single means for instantiating what they see as the UIO component, and ensuring it has a recognizable grade associated with it so they could, at some point, issue IoC configuration against it
2013-10-08T19:06:18 <colinclark> I think, anyway :)
2013-10-08T19:06:58 <colinclark> I think that latter point is what Justin_o means when he says "we probably couldn\'t map it to fluid.uiOptions this way and preserve all of the contract that a typical infusion component would have"
2013-10-08T19:07:08 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-10-08T19:07:45 <Bosmon> I think we have to abandon the idea of a "single means"
2013-10-08T19:07:54 <Bosmon> As I think parts of our discussion have suggested
2013-10-08T19:07:54 <colinclark> hmm
2013-10-08T19:08:01 <colinclark> what does that mean, specifically?
2013-10-08T19:08:17 <Bosmon> It means that the name "fluid.uiOptions" couldn\'t expect to designate different things to different people
2013-10-08T19:08:30 <colinclark> Yes, that\'s fine
2013-10-08T19:08:54 <colinclark> When I said "single means," I was referring to there being a component that represented the whole of "that UIO component up there" to user #1s
2013-10-08T19:08:58 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-10-08T19:09:09 <Bosmon> We should do this, and it would not be a problem
2013-10-08T19:09:26 <Bosmon> Although I can\'t remember whether the "builder" can be directed to fabricate a component with a particular name, but if it can\'t, it should :)
2013-10-08T19:09:33 <colinclark> I was just going to suggest...
2013-10-08T19:09:52 <colinclark> the ability for a "user" of the builder to be able to contribute grades to the thing that gets produced
2013-10-08T19:09:59 <colinclark> or something like this?
2013-10-08T19:10:00 <Bosmon> It seems that the "auxSchema" can include a naemsapce
2013-10-08T19:10:13 <Bosmon> namespace
2013-10-08T19:10:32 <colinclark> Are there other aspects of "the contract that a typical Infusion component would have" that I should keep in mind, Justin_o?
2013-10-08T19:10:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes it can take a namespace, but you would get something like fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor
2013-10-08T19:10:37 * SonicX has quit
2013-10-08T19:11:19 <anastasiac> Bosmon, could you elaborate on how this would work? would the "fluid.uiOptions" component have the builder as a subcomponent? Would it be a wrapper function that creates the builder then invokes the constructed grade? other?
2013-10-08T19:11:36 <Bosmon> It appears that it used to call itself "fluid.uiOptions.constructed"
2013-10-08T19:11:37 <colinclark> hopefully other :)
2013-10-08T19:12:00 <anastasiac> yes, that\'s the default namespace if none is provided (updated to "fluid.prefs.constructed")
2013-10-08T19:12:12 <Bosmon> anastasiac - it would work as it works now, the builder constructs a grade with a known name
2013-10-08T19:12:31 <anastasiac> so the integrator still has to create the builder then run the function? still two steps?
2013-10-08T19:12:44 <anastasiac> I thought we were trying to get it down to one step :-)
2013-10-08T19:12:58 <Bosmon> So when we restore our "UIO" component, in addition to containing some of the code present in the "prefsEditorDemo", it will also define a name that is not silly
2013-10-08T19:12:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: it\'s a real grade that gets produced but if you did something like fluid.uiOptions = outputOfBuilder then I would assume the name wouldn\'t exist in any IoC related context of to calls to fluid.defaults
2013-10-08T19:13:14 <colinclark> right
2013-10-08T19:13:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - see my remark earlier about a sensible name :)
2013-10-08T19:13:21 <Bosmon> anastasiac, likewise :)
2013-10-08T19:13:29 <Bosmon> We will put this component "back into the frameworK"
2013-10-08T19:13:40 <Bosmon> And so the demo will contain *FEWER* steps, not more
2013-10-08T19:13:41 <Bosmon> fewer!
2013-10-08T19:14:24 <anastasiac> so what will the component look like? what will its relationship to the builder be?
2013-10-08T19:14:36 <Bosmon> It\'s relationship to the builder, will be that it is BUILT by the builder
2013-10-08T19:14:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i assume what you are saying is that we run a build and use it\'s output
2013-10-08T19:14:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that is right
2013-10-08T19:15:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so maybe we just call fluid.defaults("fluid.uiOptions", {gradeNames: ["outputFromBuilderGrade", "autoInit"]
2013-10-08T19:15:23 <anastasiac> so the integrator still has two steps. 1) create the builder, 2) invoke the function
2013-10-08T19:15:26 <Justin_o> something like that
2013-10-08T19:15:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s another option, yes
2013-10-08T19:15:54 <Bosmon> anastasiac - the integrator just has ONE step
2013-10-08T19:15:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: no i think thats in the uiOptions.js, so a user would directly interact with the outputed grade
2013-10-08T19:15:58 <Bosmon> "instantiate the component"
2013-10-08T19:16:13 <anastasiac> ok, I\'m clearly not understanding something
2013-10-08T19:16:24 <anastasiac> my understanding of "the component" is that it\'s something created by the builder
2013-10-08T19:16:27 <anastasiac> that\'s not the case?
2013-10-08T19:16:29 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'ll make a pastie.. one second
2013-10-08T19:16:31 <Bosmon> anastasiac - that is the case
2013-10-08T19:16:35 <colinclark> :)
2013-10-08T19:16:39 <colinclark> awesome, thanks Justin_o
2013-10-08T19:16:48 <colinclark> So, I guess to wrap up the main part of this
2013-10-08T19:16:56 <colinclark> 1. Sorry to distract you all with going over this again
2013-10-08T19:17:01 <colinclark> 2. It\'s been very informative
2013-10-08T19:17:17 <colinclark> 3. We should, before shipping 1.5, provide this kind of affordance for users
2013-10-08T19:17:35 <colinclark> 4. I\'ll send out an email to users of the preferences framework giving them a heads up that the renaming has happened
'

b'2013-10-08T17:51:53 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2013-10-08T17:52:14 <colinclark> 1. Casual users--"I want to put UIO at the top of my web page"--Geoffrey Shea comes to mind as an example
2013-10-08T17:52:25 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: sure.. here\'s an example of the demo though so you can see how simple it is. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/demos/prefsEditor/js/prefsEditorDemo.js
2013-10-08T17:52:30 <colinclark> 2. Power users of the component--OER Commons is probably the best example
2013-10-08T17:52:46 <colinclark> 3. Developers of preferences editor tools--Chris and Alex, in particular
2013-10-08T17:53:04 <colinclark> anastasiac: I think I\'ll need your help thinking through this, too
2013-10-08T17:53:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s quite simple, but it is still a little bizarre :)
2013-10-08T17:53:21 <anastasiac> yep, I\'m following. I was in on the discussion about it
2013-10-08T17:53:29 <Bosmon> I think it might still be helpful to have an actual remnant of a component
2013-10-08T17:53:37 <colinclark> So, user #1 comes along and says "Oh, look. It\'s Infusion 1.5 will a cool new version of UIO, and it includes stuff like text to speech. I want that!"
2013-10-08T17:53:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how would that look though?
2013-10-08T17:53:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it would look exactly as it did before :)
2013-10-08T17:53:54 <Bosmon> Before you abolished the UIO component : P
2013-10-08T17:54:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: the starter schema will still give you the starting point
2013-10-08T17:54:04 <Bosmon> i.e. from the user\'s perspective
2013-10-08T17:54:13 <Bosmon> They would actually believe there was a component
2013-10-08T17:54:16 <colinclark> Justin_o: What will anastasiac end up having to explain to Geoffrey Shea?
2013-10-08T17:54:30 <Bosmon> Similarly to our "wrapper functions" that we developed for different configurations of the "Reorderer"
2013-10-08T17:54:53 <Bosmon> My suspicion is that you may have gone just one step too far with this demo....
2013-10-08T17:54:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: i should probably let anastasiac answer that, but i would assume she say something like do what\'s in the demo
2013-10-08T17:55:06 <anastasiac> :-)
2013-10-08T17:55:28 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-08T17:55:33 <colinclark> let\'s walk through it, if it\'s okay
2013-10-08T17:55:40 <anastasiac> colinclark, Bosmon, we did go back and forth with this discussion a lot, and we considered arguments on both sides of the issue
2013-10-08T17:55:59 <anastasiac> mostly, we tried to envision how an actual uiOptions component would be constructed
2013-10-08T17:56:06 <anastasiac> would it be an actual component, or just a function?
2013-10-08T17:56:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we did talk through leaving the component in place... the issue was usually around how would you modify it afterwards.. and what would it be based off of .. would it be a wrapper around the builder and etc.
2013-10-08T17:56:52 <anastasiac> michelled was also in on the discussion, so hopefully she\'s following this conversation and can contribute
2013-10-08T17:56:55 <colinclark> If it\'s okay, I\'d like to go over the specifics
2013-10-08T17:56:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think you can\'t help but admit that the code in the "prefsEditorDemo", whilst it may be quite short, is still significantly arcane
2013-10-08T17:57:01 <colinclark> and then look at the motivations
2013-10-08T17:57:19 <colinclark> So the key question is, for user #1, what do they need to do when they upgrade?
2013-10-08T17:57:33 <colinclark> Based on the things we explained to them for the current version of UIO
2013-10-08T17:58:46 <michelled> one of the things we talked about in terms of upgrading users is that we\'ve significantly change the API for UIO from 1.4. So users wanting to use 1.5 will need to follow some directions on how to change their code.
2013-10-08T17:58:48 * thealphanerd has quit
2013-10-08T17:58:52 <anastasiac> to upgrade (say, for Geoffrey Shea to upgrade), he\'d need to modify his invocation of the panel to look like the demo. The part he\'d need to customize for his integration would be the paths
2013-10-08T17:59:22 <anastasiac> and yes, we\'ll need upgrade docs!
2013-10-08T17:59:32 <colinclark> Ok
2013-10-08T17:59:36 <colinclark> so two changes?
2013-10-08T18:00:08 <anastasiac> that\'s what I\'d say
2013-10-08T18:01:01 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-10-08T18:01:04 <anastasiac> to write the docs, I\'d actually go through the exercise by upgrading something simple, like the SNOW videos site or something
2013-10-08T18:01:14 <colinclark> anastasiac: Can you point me to the current docs, so I can see concrete examples
2013-10-08T18:01:22 <colinclark> of what we\'ve instructed people to do today?
2013-10-08T18:01:57 <anastasiac> colinclark, do you mean a general UIO tutorial? or upgrade to 1.4 instructions?
2013-10-08T18:02:03 <colinclark> the UIO tutorial, yes
2013-10-08T18:02:16 <colinclark> I don\'t know if I\'m just dumb, but I can\'t find it in our doc site
2013-10-08T18:02:36 <anastasiac> you\'re not dumb, the links are just a bit out of whack still
2013-10-08T18:02:40 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: the other issue was did we want to present to the user just what used to be UIO or the entire stack that you\'d get from running the builder.. that being the enhancer, the store, and the editor
2013-10-08T18:02:43 <colinclark> the How to Guides > Infusion Components > User Interface Options link doesn\'t seem to go anywhere
2013-10-08T18:03:16 <anastasiac> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Tutorial+-+Fat+Panel+UI+Options
2013-10-08T18:03:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that thinking doesn\'t agree with the thinking we came up with in other similar situations
2013-10-08T18:03:34 <anastasiac> yeah, that\'s what I mean about out-of-whack links. It\'s a known issue :-)
2013-10-08T18:03:44 <Bosmon> Which recognised that we have, as colinclark has been observing, several distinct communities of users
2013-10-08T18:03:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: don\'t know if i follow
2013-10-08T18:03:50 <Bosmon> And we can\'t expect to have a "one thinking fits all" policy
2013-10-08T18:04:02 <colinclark> Okay, so I want to be very thorough here
2013-10-08T18:04:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m referring to the other "umbrella components" we have created in the past
2013-10-08T18:04:05 <colinclark> So for user #1
2013-10-08T18:04:06 <Bosmon> Such as the Reorderer
2013-10-08T18:04:33 <colinclark> we\'re saying:
2013-10-08T18:04:47 <colinclark> 1. based on this UIO Options tutorial, all of Section 2 will change--they\'ll have to link to different file names
2013-10-08T18:04:49 <colinclark> is that correct?
2013-10-08T18:05:11 <colinclark> Step 2, that is
2013-10-08T18:05:20 <anastasiac> colinclark, yes: If they\'re not using MyInfusion, they\'ll need to know the new filenames
2013-10-08T18:05:24 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-08T18:05:32 <colinclark> Then Step 4 changes, too
2013-10-08T18:05:49 <colinclark> Justin_o: point me again to what a user would do instead of what\'s described in Step 4?
2013-10-08T18:06:02 <anastasiac> right; they\'d do what\'s in the demo, instead
2013-10-08T18:06:24 <anastasiac> i.e. a) create the builder, then b) invoke the "assembledPrefsEditorGrade" grade of the builder
2013-10-08T18:06:39 <colinclark> Now, does a user ever have to modify their CSS or their markup with any of our "names?"
2013-10-08T18:06:41 <anastasiac> rather than a) add the page enhancer, then b) invoke the fat panel
2013-10-08T18:06:56 <colinclark> If something doesn\'t quite work, would they ever put a uio-scoped class in their markup anywhere?
2013-10-08T18:07:05 <colinclark> or in their stylesheets?
2013-10-08T18:08:01 <anastasiac> ah, colinclark, good questions. I\'m not even thinking about CSS yet, but the default selector classes have changed for ".flc-uio-*" to ".flc-prefsEditor-*"
2013-10-08T18:08:08 <Justin_o> anastasiac, colinclark: they would also have had to instantiate the settingstore too. that was another change since 1.4.
2013-10-08T18:08:16 <Justin_o> but that is taken care of by the builder
2013-10-08T18:08:24 <colinclark> The CSS names might well be a critical question here
2013-10-08T18:08:36 <colinclark> since it\'s one thing to get an error in the JavaScript console because a name has changed
2013-10-08T18:08:43 <colinclark> it\'s another altogether to have stuff just not work
2013-10-08T18:08:48 <colinclark> or "look weird"
2013-10-08T18:08:53 <anastasiac> looks the the css class names have similarly changed
2013-10-08T18:09:17 <anastasiac> so the built-in styles would work, but if a custom stylesheet is using one of our classnames, they\'ll have to modify their stylesheet
2013-10-08T18:09:35 <colinclark> How often do users have to use our classnames in their stylesheets?
2013-10-08T18:09:50 <anastasiac> hm
2013-10-08T18:10:03 <colinclark> When you guys were talking this through, did you guys look at the CSS for the IDI site, say, or Geoffrey\'s site? Or OER Commons?
2013-10-08T18:10:23 <anastasiac> I did not
2013-10-08T18:11:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think the built in styles would have to have changed either way though.. they are more analogus to operations by the preference framework than to an instance of UIO. At least in the way they are used currently.. which is something we hope to change by dropping FSS
2013-10-08T18:11:51 <anastasiac> quick check of the durham art gallery site: no custom styles scoped to our class names
2013-10-08T18:11:54 <colinclark> Justin_o: I\'m not sure I understand
2013-10-08T18:12:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: the generated css files
2013-10-08T18:12:41 <colinclark> I\'m not too worried about class names that we operate on
2013-10-08T18:12:54 <colinclark> I\'m worried about cases where people have used our classnames in "their stuff"
2013-10-08T18:13:10 <colinclark> and then just see inexplicable weirdness without error messages
2013-10-08T18:13:24 <Justin_o> i guess i\'m not following then.. is that to say we should still have a UIO component or just that we need docs?
2013-10-08T18:13:26 <anastasiac> per commons harder to check because they blend all css into just a few files, so can\'t tell source with just a quick check
2013-10-08T18:13:34 <anastasiac> s/per/oer
2013-10-08T18:14:24 <colinclark> I\'m still confused, Justin_o
2013-10-08T18:19:08 <colinclark> Okay, so for a user in group #2, who has perhaps done some heavier configuration or tweaking of UIO in their application, do we expect that they\'ll have to do much more than what user #1 does?
2013-10-08T18:20:58 <anastasiac> it depends on the tweaking they\'ve done
2013-10-08T18:21:50 <anastasiac> our thoughts on what a "uio component" would do were that it would offer the "starter set" of panels, period, and if the integrator wanted other panels or fewer panels, we would tell them not to use the component, but to use the builder directly
2013-10-08T18:22:07 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-08T18:22:11 <anastasiac> so if that\'s the nature of their tweaking, then they\'ll need to use the builder, and learn about schemas, etc.
2013-10-08T18:22:28 <colinclark> In other words, that the evolution of UIO over the past year has probably already changed or relocated just about anything that a "power user" would have configured
2013-10-08T18:22:34 <colinclark> Justin_o: Is that correct? ^
2013-10-08T18:23:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, there were extensive changes.. the can still use grades directly though if they don\'t want to use the builder.. something like what is currently being done in the Exploration Tool
2013-10-08T18:23:30 <colinclark> Ok
2013-10-08T18:23:33 <colinclark> So our third group
2013-10-08T18:23:42 <colinclark> Chris and Alex, for example
2013-10-08T18:24:26 <colinclark> they\'re basically going to wake up one morning and be told "Everything works the same as it did yesterday, but you need to change every reference to \'uio\'," is that correct?
2013-10-08T18:25:35 <Justin_o> yes.. pretty much.. although hopefully that won\'t be too much..
2013-10-08T18:26:18 <Justin_o> I think they are already using the schemas
2013-10-08T18:26:47 <colinclark> Okay, so we still need to get clarity on whether we\'ve opened up a can of worms with the CSS renaming
2013-10-08T18:27:01 <colinclark> The last thing, then, is what you were discussing first, but I didn\'t fully follow
2013-10-08T18:27:23 <colinclark> So what\'s the rationale for not providing a name and direct way to construct "a UI Options component?"
2013-10-08T18:28:10 <colinclark> I thought one of the things we agreed on at the last community meeting was that there was still going to be a thing that, tangibly, was "that UIO thing at the top of a web page," even if technically it\'s just the collection of starter grades and panels
2013-10-08T18:28:22 <anastasiac> well, Justin_o and michelled can chime with their recollections of the discussion, but here are some of mine:
2013-10-08T18:28:36 <anastasiac> we considered just how such a "component" would be constructed
2013-10-08T18:28:52 <anastasiac> would it actually be a full-fledged component? or just a wrapper function?
2013-10-08T18:29:46 <anastasiac> if it\'s just a wrapper function, then it would likely break some of the contract we have for components (e.g. you wouldn\'t be able to call "fluid.defaults() to find out the defaults, etc)
2013-10-08T18:29:58 <anastasiac> if it was a real component, how would we build it?
2013-10-08T18:30:19 <anastasiac> right now, the builder provides a single function that invokes the store, enhancer and fat panel
2013-10-08T18:30:58 <colinclark> We seem to have a concept of a "GPII Discovery Tool" component, for example: https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/demos/discoveryTool/demo.js#L46
2013-10-08T18:31:01 <anastasiac> basically, we ended up feeling that requiring the integrator to use the builder was not much of a burden
2013-10-08T18:31:02 <colinclark> Why is this any different?
2013-10-08T18:31:58 * thealphanerd has quit
2013-10-08T18:31:59 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it think you covered the main points..
2013-10-08T18:32:42 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-10-08T18:32:43 * thealphanerd has quit
2013-10-08T18:32:57 <colinclark> Okay, so we have the concept of a Discovery (Exploration) Tool component
2013-10-08T18:33:10 <colinclark> I\'m assuming we also have components that represent the PCP and PMT and so on
2013-10-08T18:33:20 <colinclark> I still don\'t quite understand how this guy, our old friend here, is any different
2013-10-08T18:33:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think we need to address those issues that anastasiac mentioned to come up with a uio component that we distribute
2013-10-08T18:34:03 <colinclark> What options were discussed for potentially addressing those issues?
2013-10-08T18:34:31 <Justin_o> colinclark: maybe it would be helpful to start at what we expect to get from fluid.uiOptions
2013-10-08T18:34:46 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-08T18:34:55 <anastasiac> colinclark, (not justification, just data points for consideration): the discovery tool (as currently implemented) doesn\'t use the builder, but rather the fatPanel grade directly
2013-10-08T18:34:59 <colinclark> Justin_o: What do you think user #1 would expect to get from it?
2013-10-08T18:35:10 <anastasiac> afaik, it doesn\'t instantiate the store (but I might be misunderstanding)
2013-10-08T18:36:29 * yzen has quit
2013-10-08T18:36:34 <colinclark> That suggests to me that we haven\'t thought about the user experience of the Preferences Framework for external "user #1" type users
2013-10-08T18:36:38 <colinclark> which is fair enough
2013-10-08T18:36:46 <colinclark> we\'ve had enough work to do just making it work :)
2013-10-08T18:37:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: well we probably would use the builder for the Exploration Tool except that we can\'t because of the model transformations that it has to do and we can\'t support yet
2013-10-08T18:37:57 <colinclark> I just want to make sure we have a plan, before we ship 1.5, for providing users with a recognizable "affordance" for constructing these types of components
2013-10-08T18:37:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: if i\'m user #1 i\'d probably expect everything.. store, enhancer, editor
2013-10-08T18:38:21 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'d expect the thing to work
2013-10-08T18:38:22 <colinclark> the builder seems like a fairly low-level construct, from the perspective of user #1, no?
2013-10-08T18:38:28 * mrvisser_ has quit
2013-10-08T18:38:52 <anastasiac> (musing) our current sites using UIO (e.g. IDI, SNOW videos, etc) are actually still using 1.4, so we could consider upgrading them, as an exercise in learning about user #1\'s experience\xe2\x80\xa6

2013-10-08T12:54:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: i filed a jira for the text size and line spacing issue http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5171
2013-10-08T12:58:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: how is the rest of FLUID-5161 coming?

2013-10-08T13:24:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m poking around at FLUID-5171 and it seems that the panel opens after the calculations are done. Meaning that the event is fired before it\'s open.. like an on event instead of an after.. perhaps it has something to do with the animation, but i\'m not sure
2013-10-08T13:25:20 <cindyli> good finding, Justin_o
2013-10-08T13:31:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: but i don\'t know how to get around it
2013-10-08T13:32:25 <cindyli> lol
2013-10-08T13:35:34 <cindyli> we\'ll figure out. i\'m finishing off 5161 soon, after that will take a look on 5171
2013-10-08T13:37:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: cool thanks.. i\'m delving more and am wondering now if it is an issue with expanders
2013-10-08T13:41:55 * yzen joined the channel
2013-10-08T13:47:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: fixed the textSize, now looking at linespacing
2013-10-08T13:47:42 <cindyli> Justin_o: the pull request for 5161 is ready for another round of review
2013-10-08T13:47:57 <cindyli> yay, congrats, Justin_o
2013-10-08T13:48:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. i\'ll take a look at that soon
2013-10-08T13:48:17 <cindyli> sure, how did you fix the text size
2013-10-08T13:49:57 * SonicX joined the channel
2013-10-08T13:53:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: the generateTextSizeInEm invoker needed to be dynamic.. it looks like a similar approach should work for linespacing, but it doesn\'t seem to be :(
2013-10-08T13:53:42 <cindyli> interesting
2013-10-08T14:03:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. so i think FLUID-5171 is fixed.. perhaps we should just fold the change into FLUID-5161
2013-10-08T14:03:20 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2013-10-08T14:03:45 <cindyli> sounds reasonable, Justin_o
2013-10-08T14:04:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: i have closed http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5123
2013-10-08T14:04:53 <Justin_o> maybe we can re-examine if that actually can be removed and add it to the FLUID-5161 pull request as well
2013-10-08T14:05:14 <cindyli> ok
2013-10-08T14:05:49 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you want me to merge the FLUID-5171 changes into the FLUID-5161 branch?
2013-10-08T14:06:05 <cindyli> go ahead, Justin_o
2013-10-08T14:06:38 <Justin_o> cindyli:  okay.. also have you merged in master
2013-10-08T14:06:53 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o
2013-10-08T14:09:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: by the way, it looks like you lost the UIO icon from the demo portal
2013-10-08T14:10:06 <cindyli> ah what?
2013-10-08T14:10:35 <Justin_o> i guess i\'ll have to show you later
2013-10-08T14:10:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2013-10-08T14:11:34 <cindyli> which page, Justin_o not src/demos/index.html
2013-10-08T14:11:44 <cindyli> uio icon still on that page
2013-10-08T14:12:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes
2013-10-08T14:12:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: by the way, i fixed FLUID-5171 in my FLUID-5161 branch
2013-10-08T14:12:43 <cindyli> ok, i will merge it in
2013-10-08T14:14:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2013-10-08T14:20:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m looking into FLUID-5123 at the moment..
2013-10-08T14:20:21 <Justin_o> i think things still work, but could you help me with a bit of testing
2013-10-08T14:20:36 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o

2013-10-08T16:40:45 <cindyli> merged and pushed up, Justin_o
2013-10-08T16:41:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. did the changes look okay?
2013-10-08T16:41:48 <cindyli> they look ok, Justin_o
2013-10-08T16:42:07 <Justin_o> michelled: did you want to have another infusion 1.5 release chat at a community meeting in the coming weeks?
2013-10-08T16:42:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2013-10-08T16:42:30 <cindyli> Justin_o: in terms of the IE8 failure, seems caused by framework code changes, some fluid IoC tests fail with the same error
2013-10-08T16:43:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. is there a jira for that?
2013-10-08T16:44:37 <cindyli> i don\'t find any, Justin_o, i will create one
2013-10-08T16:46:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. can you make that a blocker for 1.5 as well
2013-10-08T16:46:47 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o

2013-10-08T17:09:36 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: does anyone have any topics they\'d like to cover in an upcoming community meeting?
2013-10-08T17:14:19 <michelled> Justin_o: I think we should make sure we cover as many of the 1.5 issues as we can in the community meetings
2013-10-08T17:14:39 <Justin_o> michelled: okay.. i\'ll book another meeting for that..
2013-10-08T17:16:04 <Justin_o> here\'s the community meeting schedule so far http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops
2013-10-08T17:16:39 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-10-08T17:20:25 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: the demo portal has a link to this wiki page http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/User+Interface+Options
2013-10-08T17:20:51 <Justin_o> when should we change this? should the url be changed as part of the FLUID-5161?
2013-10-08T17:21:25 <anastasiac> Justin_o, oh my\xe2\x80\xa6 probably all of the demos have bad links. We don\'t really have proper \'landing pages\' for any of the components any more
2013-10-08T17:21:35 <anastasiac> Justin_o, what would you change it to?
2013-10-08T17:22:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i don\'t know.. maybe something call Preference Framework, but not sure
2013-10-08T17:22:44 <anastasiac> yeah, for the UIO demo, a link to the main Prefs Framework page might work
2013-10-08T17:23:36 <Justin_o> anastasiac: you\'re right though it seems like a lot if not all of the links in the demo portal are broken.. maybe we can just fix them all at the same time.. and defer the UI Options one till then
2013-10-08T17:23:43 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: what do you think about that
2013-10-08T17:23:58 <Justin_o> or we could make this one point at preferences framework right away, even if the page doesn\'t yet exist
2013-10-08T17:24:00 <anastasiac> we definitely need to fix them all at some point
2013-10-08T17:24:14 <anastasiac> we do have a prefs framework page, you know
2013-10-08T17:24:20 <anastasiac> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Preferences+Framework
2013-10-08T17:24:27 <Justin_o> a cool
2013-10-08T17:24:30 <anastasiac> :-)
2013-10-08T17:24:39 <Justin_o> i\'ll file a jira about fixing the rest

2013-10-08T17:28:48 <colinclark> yzen: Have you written any code with Web Sockets in Node.js before for other projects?
2013-10-08T17:28:56 <yzen> no
2013-10-08T17:30:06 <colinclark> I suspect it\'s looming for the GPII :)
2013-10-08T17:30:09 <colinclark> should be fun work
2013-10-08T17:33:51 <Bosmon2> What will we do with these SOCKKETS?
2013-10-08T17:44:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: merge FLUID-5161
2013-10-08T17:45:02 <cindyli> yay! thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-08T17:45:25 <colinclark> Bosmon2: Communicate between the PMT and the Flow Manager, most likely
2013-10-08T17:45:35 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: FLUID-5161 was merged... this involved a rather large renaming and moving of UI Options to be the preferences framework.
2013-10-08T17:45:45 <anastasiac> yay!
2013-10-08T17:45:49 <michelled> :)
2013-10-08T17:45:54 <colinclark> It looks like we\'re going to need the ability to "provision a USB stick" via the PMT, which is a web app
2013-10-08T17:46:08 <colinclark> Justin_o: Merged into master?
2013-10-08T17:46:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes.. it\'s in master
2013-10-08T17:46:50 <colinclark> wow!@
2013-10-08T17:47:17 <colinclark> So, can I ask a few questions about it, just so I\'m clear?
2013-10-08T17:47:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2013-10-08T17:47:34 <colinclark> I\'m thinking we\'ll want to start explaining to people why they shouldn\'t use the term "UIO" any more for many things
2013-10-08T17:47:41 <colinclark> and I want to make sure I\'ve got it right
2013-10-08T17:47:58 <colinclark> So a casual user of the "UIO component" still uses the same names, is that correct?
2013-10-08T17:48:27 <colinclark> i.e. they call some function like fluid.fatPanelUIOptions or whatever it was previously?
2013-10-08T17:50:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: well.... the change was a bit more drastic.. there is no UI Options component at all anymore
2013-10-08T17:51:06 <Justin_o> colinclark:  so the expectation is that most people will use the builder
2013-10-08T17:51:12 <colinclark> oh
2013-10-08T17:51:16 <colinclark> hmm
2013-10-08T17:51:32 <colinclark> I think we should chat through this for a bit, from the perspective of user experience
2013-10-08T17:51:39 <Bosmon2> Justin_o - I was a little concerned about that possible development yesterday, and I\'m sorry I didn\'t manage to start more of a conversation about it
2013-10-08T17:51:41 <colinclark> And I think I can define a few different "types" of users
2013-10-08T17:51:51 <colinclark> I\'ll use exemplars of these types--real people
