2013-10-09T14:20:09 <Justin_o> michelled: could you please review the latest changes for FLUID-5161 https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/415
2013-10-09T14:20:25 <michelled> sure Justin_o
2013-10-09T14:20:41 <Justin_o> michelled, yzen: if either of you have time, can you take a look at my pull request for the modulefiles grunt plugin too https://github.com/fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles/pull/2
2013-10-09T14:20:45 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks
2013-10-09T14:22:23 <Justin_o> colinclark, jessm: do you think we will have time before the next release for one of the designers to make new icon font based icons for the demo portal http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/
2013-10-09T14:22:50 <colinclark> What\'s the benefit, Justin_o?
2013-10-09T14:24:40 <Justin_o> 1) it will help us get rid of a few more images from our repo 2) we are missing an icon anyways so it might be a good time to change them all and not just make a new image based one 3) if we put a prefs editor on the page it will be able to adjust them..
2013-10-09T14:25:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^ see above.. not immediately necessary for sure, but if we have time it would be nice
2013-10-09T14:25:51 <colinclark> ok

2013-10-09T18:32:54 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: would anyone like to join the community meeting today remotely.. the topic will be "New Model Infrastructure" lead by Bosmon
2013-10-09T18:33:05 <colinclark> I\'ll join, yes
2013-10-09T18:33:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay.. thanks.. i\'ll skype you in
2013-10-09T18:33:58 <Bosmon> Hi
2013-10-09T18:34:39 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone: I have prepared some "useful notes" on the new infrastructure which would be useful reading before/during the meeting: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/New+Notes+on+the+ChangeApplier
2013-10-09T18:35:00 <Bosmon> Please give me a few minutes because I will not be ready immediately
2013-10-09T18:35:07 <colinclark> :)

2013-10-09T20:18:22 * michelled joined the channel
2013-10-09T20:18:27 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-09T20:21:46 <Bosmon> I think that your "fluid.prefs.compositePanel.rebaseTree" even still represents some overkill : P
2013-10-09T20:22:02 <Bosmon> Do you actually expect anything to appear in the "modelRelayRules" field?
2013-10-09T20:22:29 <Bosmon> I guess it does
2013-10-09T20:22:41 * sgithens has quit
2013-10-09T20:22:52 <Justin_o> yes.. it corresponds to the model relay used between the subPanels and parent
2013-10-09T20:23:05 <Justin_o> so that we know what to change the valuebinding to
2013-10-09T20:23:22 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-10-09T20:23:30 <Bosmon> I think there is not really a need to use the model transformation system here
2013-10-09T20:23:33 <Bosmon> As we discussed
2013-10-09T20:23:38 <Bosmon> "Some functions" will be just fine : P
2013-10-09T20:24:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  is it worth changing?
2013-10-09T20:24:18 <Bosmon> Well, it would save you a dozen lines or so :)
2013-10-09T20:24:59 <Justin_o> :) okay i\'ll look into that
2013-10-09T20:25:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m heading out now.. if you have more feedback please send it along and I\'ll start in on it tomorrow
2013-10-09T20:25:28 <Bosmon> I think your other code looks pretty good
2013-10-09T20:25:37 <Bosmon> I\'d like to see this regex surfaced as a dedicated function
2013-10-09T20:25:37 <Bosmon> prefObj[mdlPrefix + prefName.replace(/[.]/g, "_")] = rule;
2013-10-09T20:26:04 <Bosmon> Especially since it seems you do a similar operation earlier in the code
2013-10-09T20:26:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right i should clean that up
