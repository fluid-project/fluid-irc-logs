2013-09-19T21:19:33 <michelled> colinclark: FLUID-5132 is now in. just to let you know. you\'ve already pushed the pull request that the GPII folks were waiting for, so no rush on getting to the other ones
2013-09-19T21:19:41 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-19T21:19:44 <colinclark> thank you
2013-09-19T21:19:49 <michelled> np
2013-09-19T21:20:47 <michelled> Bosmon: I looked at why that invoker needed to be dynamic, but I couldn\'t determine the reason https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/406/files
2013-09-19T21:21:08 <michelled> when I step through the code, it looks identical whether the dynamic flag is on or not
2013-09-19T21:21:14 <michelled> but the result is different
2013-09-19T21:21:40 <michelled> when I have the dynamic flag, the correct classes get put on the labels and the styling bug in the contrast panel is fixed.
2013-09-19T21:22:10 <Bosmon> michelled - this may represent some kind of bug in the application, so it would be good to get to the bottom of it
2013-09-19T21:22:11 <michelled> unless firebug was messing with me. I suppose that\'s possible
2013-09-19T21:22:43 <Bosmon> For a start, it would only seem possible for there to be a problem if the invoker is executing twice or more
2013-09-19T21:22:46 <Bosmon> Do you seem to see that?
2013-09-19T21:23:11 <michelled> it happens on page load and then when I open the fat panel.
2013-09-19T21:23:33 <michelled> I think that might be an issue we should deal with - we probably shouldn\'t happen twice
2013-09-19T21:23:43 <Bosmon> So the issue would have to be that the dom node is different the 2nd time
2013-09-19T21:24:04 <Bosmon> If you look at the node which it grabs the first time, you may see that it has become "detached" the 2nd time
2013-09-19T21:24:26 <Bosmon> That is, if you keep the Firebug inspector focused on it through the process, you might see that it is no longer in the document
2013-09-19T21:24:38 <Bosmon> But has gone to the "strange purgatory" for detached DOM nodes

2013-09-19T13:22:29 <amilchev> hi cindyli
2013-09-19T13:22:41 <amilchev> got time for a quick question?
2013-09-19T13:22:42 <cindyli> hi amilchev
2013-09-19T13:22:44 <cindyli> yes
2013-09-19T13:23:44 <amilchev> cindyli: I sent a mail to Justin and the UX mailing list cc-ed, but don\'t know if you participate in it so perhaps you haven\'t seen it
2013-09-19T13:24:09 <cindyli> umm.. don\'t think i got it
2013-09-19T13:24:15 <amilchev> cindyli: it\'s related to the GET / POST http requests we chatted about yesterday
2013-09-19T13:25:04 <cindyli> can you forward me the email, amilchev
2013-09-19T13:25:14 <cindyli> cli@ocadu.ca
2013-09-19T13:25:21 <amilchev> ok thanks
2013-09-19T13:25:24 <cindyli> np
2013-09-19T13:26:13 <amilchev> can u see it now
2013-09-19T13:31:42 <cindyli> yes, amilchev. unfortunately, i\'m perhaps not the right person to answer those questions. in terms of the POST request, it seems the gpii server my code is using was set up from a different gpii branch, which leads the different POST request.
2013-09-19T13:32:00 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-09-19T13:33:15 <cindyli> with regards to the returned format, I certainly can share the return from my gpii server but it may not be same as what your server is going to return, since yours might be a different setup
2013-09-19T13:33:43 <cindyli> the better person to check with is the one who set up the gpii server that you code is going to use, amilchev
2013-09-19T13:35:23 <amilchev> ok, sorry for disturbing you then, cindyli
2013-09-19T13:36:30 <cindyli> not a problem, amilchev. in case it would help, i\'m sharing the GET return from my gpii server here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/andrei.json
2013-09-19T13:37:36 <cindyli> in my case for the discovery too, there would be a new entry key for it such as:
2013-09-19T13:38:07 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.org/applications/fluid.gpii.discoveryTool": [{value: {\xe2\x80\xa6}}]
2013-09-19T13:39:33 <cindyli> that entry key is what\'s defined in GpiiStore.js, the defaults block of "gpii.discoveryTool.gpiiStore", the code POSTs and GETs based on this entry key
2013-09-19T13:40:38 <cindyli> "are based .."
2013-09-19T13:42:16 <amilchev> cindyli: that makes sense
2013-09-19T13:42:22 <amilchev> thanks
2013-09-19T13:42:26 <cindyli> anytime

2013-09-19T15:22:14 <anastasiac> cindyli, could you tell me something about the "%" notation here https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/AuxBuilder.js#L263
2013-09-19T15:25:11 <cindyli> anastasiac: %prefKey is meant to be replaced by an internally generated preference key - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/AuxBuilder.js#L129-131
2013-09-19T15:27:26 <anastasiac> so, cindyli, the prefKey is added to the component options? Am I reading that right?
2013-09-19T15:28:39 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\'m trying to figure out where the framework goes to look up the prefKey
2013-09-19T15:29:56 <cindyli> anastasiac: the prefKey is not a component option. it\'s an unique key extracted from aux schema to identify each preference.
2013-09-19T15:30:28 <cindyli> it\'s only used internally by auxBuilder
2013-09-19T15:30:31 <anastasiac> ok, so this is very specific to the aux schema builder? It\'s not a notation that will be used in general
2013-09-19T15:30:45 <cindyli> exactly
2013-09-19T15:30:50 <anastasiac> so it doesn\'t need to be documented as an IoC reference syntax
2013-09-19T15:30:59 <anastasiac> ok, thanks, cindyli

2013-09-19T19:58:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i\'m just about to leave though.. but can you take a look at this jira ( http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5131 ) and make sure that the details are a little bit better.. i\'ve started implementation off of it so far which you can see in my https://github.com/jobara/infusion/tree/FLUID-5131 branch

2013-09-19T20:01:46 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2013-09-19T20:03:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have any feedback now.. or if you could comment on the jira that and my commits, that would be helpful
2013-09-19T20:03:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - I\'m wondering why you do the conversion from . to _ when combining the preference map
2013-09-19T20:03:38 <Bosmon> Can you explain the motivation here?
2013-09-19T20:05:03 * kasparnet has quit
2013-09-19T20:05:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s because it\'s just the value used in the parents internal model.. i think the UIO builder already does something similar to that\xe2\x80\xa6 but basically here we need to distinguish between paths segments and actual end points
2013-09-19T20:05:48 <Justin_o> seemed reasonable to name the model key after the preference it was for
2013-09-19T20:07:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
