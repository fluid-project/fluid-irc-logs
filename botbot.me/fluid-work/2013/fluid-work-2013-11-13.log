2013-11-13T17:33:21 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I have questions about the new \'conditional\' show/hide functionality: how is the controlling pref evaluated? for "truthiness"? what happens if someone ties it to a non-boolean? can we control the test?
2013-11-13T17:36:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it only works for boolean values
2013-11-13T17:37:09 <Justin_o> if it\'s truthy it will likely display
2013-11-13T17:37:45 <anastasiac> Justin_o, so it will still "work" for a non-boolean pref, but it will do a "truthiness" test and likely come up true?

2013-11-13T20:58:17 <Justin_o> yzen: any idea what a targetShadow undefined error comes from
2013-11-13T20:58:54 <yzen> hmm Justin_o something to do with options merging afaik
2013-11-13T20:59:13 <Justin_o> yzen: it seems to be coming from this function fluid.clearDistributions
2013-11-13T20:59:21 <Justin_o> but i can\'t really understand why it\'s an error there
2013-11-13T20:59:51 <yzen> something you need is not resolved ? not sure to be honest
2013-11-13T21:00:06 <Justin_o> yzen: okay.. thanks
2013-11-13T21:02:20 <Justin_o> yzen: do you know if there\'s a way to set priorities in the IoC testing framework
2013-11-13T21:02:25 <Justin_o> for listening to events
2013-11-13T21:03:05 <yzen> hmm good question i\'d think that would/should work just like the listener spec in component options
2013-11-13T21:03:13 <yzen> does plain order not work, Justin_o ?
2013-11-13T21:04:43 <Justin_o> yzen: just noticed that the source of the issue is from within the IoC testing framework on a call to the IoC framework.. i wonder what\'s happening
2013-11-13T21:05:19 <Justin_o> yzen: so my tests runs. after an onReady event.. i have to use the IoCSS syntax to get it to work.. but then it runs into the above error after the test sequence
2013-11-13T21:06:29 <yzen> hmm is something being cleared when it\'s already deleted ?
2013-11-13T21:07:32 <Justin_o> i don\'t know.. but it seems to be trying to unbind things
2013-11-13T21:08:22 * michelled joined the channel
2013-11-13T21:08:53 <Justin_o> yzen: i\'ll look into it again tomorrow
2013-11-13T21:13:44 <Justin_o> yzen: got it.. had to do with the IoCSS and two things having the same name i think
2013-11-13T21:14:04 <yzen> i like the i think part :)
2013-11-13T21:14:42 <Justin_o> :) i\'m only marginally certain, but i\'ve moved past the error now
