2013-09-16T20:11:23 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone: you may be interested that I have recently written up our demands block thinking as part of this GPII JIRA: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-209
2013-09-16T20:11:49 <Bosmon> Since the GPII is the active project with by far the most demands blocks in circulation, our general purge will have to start there
2013-09-16T20:12:14 <Bosmon> But in general, everyone should be put on notice to write no new demands blocks, and strive to get rid of existing ones : P
2013-09-16T20:13:29 <colinclark> Demands blocks will end up being some kind of Fringe-esque anachronism
2013-09-16T20:13:44 <colinclark> The future for another, parallel dimension
2013-09-16T20:13:59 <colinclark> but oddly "eighteenth century" here in this one
2013-09-16T20:14:15 <Bosmon> Demands blocks === blimps
2013-09-16T20:14:22 <Bosmon> THE AIR TRAVEL OF THE FUTURE
2013-09-16T20:14:26 <colinclark> yes, exactly!

2013-09-16T20:53:49 <colinclark> which you mentioned we have so far avoided :P
2013-09-16T20:54:06 <Bosmon> colinclark - so it seems, yes : P
2013-09-16T20:54:50 <colinclark> Do you have any particular strategies for how you plan to avoid revisiting this particularly famous sort of bike shed?
2013-09-16T20:55:10 <Bosmon> no plans, no

2013-09-16T20:59:07 <Bosmon> In the past I believe we have, for better or worse, adopted the policy of "follow the guidelines of some well-known figure in the community" : P
2013-09-16T20:59:23 <Bosmon> I argue though, that an 80 character line limit doesn\'t really make use of the facilities of the 21st century .....

2013-09-16T21:15:24 <colinclark> hey kasparnet and yzen, I have a quick question for you
2013-09-16T21:15:35 <kasparnet> sure
2013-09-16T21:15:56 <colinclark> I\'m just writing up the architecture section for the next Preferences for Global Access "design deliverable"
2013-09-16T21:16:04 <colinclark> PGA uses the same bizarre convention as Cloud4all
2013-09-16T21:16:14 <colinclark> where "deliverable" should be translated as "long report"
2013-09-16T21:16:16 <colinclark> ;)
2013-09-16T21:16:31 <colinclark> Anyway, yzen and I were talking before he left about Web Sockets
2013-09-16T21:16:54 <colinclark> and I\'m writing up a section about how a web-based application such as the PCP could communicate with a locally-installed Flow Manager
2013-09-16T21:17:15 <colinclark> I remember back in San Diego we were talking about the need for a browser plugin
2013-09-16T21:17:34 <colinclark> my experience with the Leap Motion controller, for example, suggests that it should be quite viable to do something without plugins using Web Sockets
2013-09-16T21:17:51 <colinclark> Anyway, in San Diego I think we identified two main cases for "cross-world" communication
2013-09-16T21:17:56 <yzen> colinclark: that\'d be nice
2013-09-16T21:18:14 <kasparnet> yeah, avoiding plugins would be great
2013-09-16T21:18:18 <colinclark> The first case was for a preferences editor to say "Hey, Flow Manager, the user wants to change their preferences temporarily"
2013-09-16T21:18:25 <colinclark> So this might the case of a preview
2013-09-16T21:18:35 <colinclark> or it might be a "this session only" change to their settings
2013-09-16T21:19:07 <colinclark> The second case we talked about was the case where a web-based Solution needed to know if some need or preference had already been satisfied by a local, desktop-based solution
2013-09-16T21:19:43 <colinclark> I think it was to prevent the "4x larger text" problem in the case where a web app reads the same preference as the desktop, say for 2x the text size
2013-09-16T21:19:49 <colinclark> is this all sounding familiar so far?
2013-09-16T21:19:53 <yzen> colinclark: yep
2013-09-16T21:19:58 <colinclark> Cool
2013-09-16T21:20:05 <colinclark> Okay, so I think we\'re not quite ready yet to solve the second case
2013-09-16T21:20:15 <colinclark> In terms of thinking through how this would actually happen
2013-09-16T21:20:26 <colinclark> Do you know if we now have any kind of Flow Manager API for the first case?
2013-09-16T21:20:35 <colinclark> I\'m pressure Evgeni had something sketched out in a branch
2013-09-16T21:20:44 <colinclark> but I\'m guessing that never made its way into a pushable pull request?
2013-09-16T21:20:47 <colinclark> or did it?
2013-09-16T21:23:17 <yzen> colinclark: yes that\'s in his branch, never been reviewed formally
2013-09-16T21:23:26 <colinclark> Ok
2013-09-16T21:23:41 <colinclark> If you were to implement it, can you speculate super quickly on what it would look like, yzen?
2013-09-16T21:23:52 <colinclark> I guess a
2013-09-16T21:24:00 <colinclark> "preferencesChanged" POST request or something?
2013-09-16T21:25:17 * jessm has quit
2013-09-16T21:25:42 <yzen> colinclark: right so a POST with temp preferences
2013-09-16T21:25:49 <yzen> i think evgeni had update
2013-09-16T21:25:56 <yzen> so like /user/token/update
2013-09-16T21:25:57 * michelled has quit
2013-09-16T21:26:18 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-16T21:26:25 <colinclark> seems reasonable enough
2013-09-16T21:26:36 <yzen> colinclark: ya i like it too
2013-09-16T21:26:37 <yzen> btw
2013-09-16T21:26:45 <yzen> i was about to remove the /user/ part
2013-09-16T21:26:57 <yzen> when kasparnet rightfully reminded that all user listeners would not work any more

2013-09-16T21:39:21 <colinclark> They probably shouldn\'t have hardcoded URLs in them :P
2013-09-16T21:39:34 <colinclark> yzen: Could we expose the new one and deprecate the old one at some point?
2013-09-16T21:39:49 <colinclark> (the new URL scheme, I mean)
2013-09-16T21:46:19 <yzen> colinclark: yes for sure
2013-09-16T21:46:23 <colinclark> cool
2013-09-16T21:46:51 <colinclark> And then we can file a JIRA against the various user listeners, saying that they should provide parameterized Flow Manager URLs
2013-09-16T21:47:44 <colinclark> In the future, I suspect we\'re going to want to have some kind of checksumming or something when the GPII starts up so that it does some basic sanity-checking of itself
2013-09-16T21:47:59 <yzen> colinclark: ya that\'s a good idea
2013-09-16T22:16:46 <kasparnet> hi avtar, I checked the DNS\' and they seem to be pointing the right way
2013-09-16T22:17:02 <kasparnet> how is access to the servers looking (for yura to run the servers)

2013-09-16T22:24:31 <avtar> i\'ll have all three components online within 1 - 2 hours
2013-09-16T22:26:00 <avtar> if possible please confirm that you\'re able to run them locally using the code in the master branch and the instructions in the universal repository
2013-09-16T22:26:28 <avtar> yzen or kasparnet ^
2013-09-16T22:29:01 <kasparnet> avtar: cool! Yura will check that things work locally, etc
2013-09-16T22:29:36 <kasparnet> avtar: also, I think that the components will run off the v0.2 branch, but I\'ll let yzen confirm that

2013-09-16T22:45:12 <yzen> avtar: how late is not late enough :) ?
2013-09-16T22:45:25 <kasparnet> avtar: well, with the speed yura is reviewing pull requests, we\'re not gonna get to bed for another 8 hours
2013-09-16T22:45:27 <kasparnet> :)
2013-09-16T22:45:50 <avtar> but i skipped lunch today because that seemed like a good idea at the time so i think i need to find something to eat toute suite
2013-09-16T22:46:24 <avtar> i\'ll log on from home in about 30 mins
2013-09-16T22:47:24 <kasparnet> ok, sounds good
2013-09-16T22:47:25 <avtar> but if you guys can confirm the requirements, deployment docs, branch info, etc then i can continue after linner
2013-09-16T22:47:34 <kasparnet> cool
2013-09-16T22:47:37 <kasparnet> thanks avtar
2013-09-16T22:47:55 <avtar> either email me or i\'ll check the channel logs

2013-09-16T13:31:19 <jhung> Justin_o: as for the drop shadow, it's fine on my side. The drop shadow should be present but without a blur on the tree logo.

2013-09-16T16:58:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds good.. i think we'll probably need someway of identifying when we need to create the combined panel too
2013-09-16T16:59:14 <cindyli> agree

2013-09-16T19:16:20 <michelled> Justin_o: I just created this JIRA and put it fix for 1.5 http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5135
2013-09-16T19:16:33 <michelled> I think we should fix it since we just introduced it with our new demos
2013-09-16T19:17:08 <Justin_o> michelled: okay
2013-09-16T19:17:37 <Justin_o> michelled: not sure at the moment how to fix that because the cookie is on the same domain but we can take a look at it for sure
2013-09-16T19:18:23 <michelled> Justin_o: the cookie name should probably be configurable if it isn't already
