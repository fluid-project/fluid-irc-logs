b'2013-09-20T17:58:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2013-09-20T17:58:14 <Bosmon> I think it would be better to combine the entries on "func/funcName" since these are essentially the same record
2013-09-20T17:58:59 <Bosmon> I need to dash off to the dentist unfortunately, but I\'ll be back in about an hour
2013-09-20T17:59:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll make that change and check in with you again when you are back about the distribute options things
2013-09-20T18:06:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon, anastasiac: updated the invoker page

2013-09-20T18:29:07 <cindyli> michelled: Justin_o and I were talking about how to send the pull request for http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-185, which is to set/get discovery tool preferences from the gpii server
2013-09-20T18:30:28 <michelled> cindyli: can you not send the pull request in the same way we generally do?
2013-09-20T18:30:30 <cindyli> we can point ajax calls to gpii server daily build site (once it\'s CORS enables), but since DT has to use one user id, everyone who plays discovery tool site will apply the pref changes to the same data
2013-09-20T18:30:44 <cindyli> what would u suggest, michelled

2013-09-20T18:32:35 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t like that idea - it will make DT look broken when we have multiple people using it
2013-09-20T18:33:23 <michelled> cindyli: perhaps there is something we could do to give the feeling of having multiple users.

2013-09-20T18:34:50 <Justin_o> michelled, cindyli: do you know if there are designs for a login?
2013-09-20T18:35:43 <cindyli> i don\'t know
2013-09-20T18:38:10 <cindyli> even with login, tryout sites usually provide test id for users to play with. we still cannot guarantee different users are using different ids when they login at the same time
2013-09-20T18:40:11 <cindyli> michelled, Justin_o, can we keep DT using cookie store by default and provide instructions on how to turn on and use gpii store?

2013-09-20T19:44:07 <anastasiac> cindyli, the UIO contrast icons on the build site are not being styled. Is that a known issue?
2013-09-20T19:44:17 <anastasiac> http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/gradesDemo/html/uiOptions.html
2013-09-20T19:48:12 <cindyli> anastasiac: doesn\'t seem like a known issue, at least not in the bug tracker
2013-09-20T19:48:34 <anastasiac> I wonder when that creeped in, cindyli
2013-09-20T19:48:47 <cindyli> not sure. trying with my local UIO
2013-09-20T19:49:03 <anastasiac> it\'s ok in full-page...
2013-09-20T19:49:06 <anastasiac> odd
2013-09-20T19:49:48 <anastasiac> cindyli, it\'s broken for me locally, too
2013-09-20T19:50:06 <cindyli> same here
2013-09-20T19:50:51 <Bosmon> It is a known issue
2013-09-20T19:51:01 <Bosmon> michelled was investigating it yesterday
2013-09-20T19:52:03 <Bosmon> It is covered by this pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/406
2013-09-20T19:52:13 <Bosmon> Although it would still be nice to know the reason this change is required
2013-09-20T19:52:47 <michelled> Bosmon: I didn\'t manage to spend time investigating it. I can look at it on Monday or someone else could look at it.
2013-09-20T19:53:08 <anastasiac> ah, right, the mystery fix
2013-09-20T19:53:23 <anastasiac> ok, so I won\'t file a JIRA :-)

2013-09-20T14:14:11 <Justin_o> michelled: basically i just did something like {jira: project = \xe2\x80\xa6 |renderMode=dynamic}
2013-09-20T14:46:14 <Justin_o> michelled: looks like the gpii build is up http://build.gpii.net/prefsEditors/demos/discoveryTool/
2013-09-20T14:46:43 <Justin_o> should we put a link to that on our build site? not sure it\'s worth it because it is basically the same as the one we have up there.. well older really
2013-09-20T14:48:19 <michelled> good question Justin_o - I think it should be publicized on the GPII list. it will encourage some pull requests so the whole community can see the work that is being done.
2013-09-20T14:48:34 <michelled> feel like sending a message?
2013-09-20T14:49:09 <Justin_o> michelled: maybe we should wait till avtar is online to verify everything is good to go.. he had mentioned something about an IP address changing..

2013-09-20T15:17:28 <avtar> i brought up the issue with yong because the logs on the vm don\'t show anything out of the ordinary and it\'s reachable via its public ip from outside of the idrc network
2013-09-20T15:23:17 <avtar> yong would like for me to test it with a new public ip
2013-09-20T15:23:59 <avtar> the dns change might be unavoidable

2013-09-20T16:09:27 <cindyli> yzen, avtar, in order to POST json data to a CORS enabled gpii server, an OPTIONS request needs to be sent first to ask whether the POST request from the client domain is allowed. The server responded status code for this OPTIONS request is expected to be 200. right now  I\'m getting 404 "not found" for OPTIONS requests. I\'m wondering:
2013-09-20T16:09:44 <cindyli> 1. can we config the GPII web server to handle OPTOINS?
2013-09-20T16:10:45 * colinclark has quit
2013-09-20T16:10:47 <cindyli> 2. if 1 is not doable, we may need to adjust server code to handle OPTIONS

2013-09-20T17:17:37 <kasparnet> what changes do you need me to do
2013-09-20T17:18:51 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I am looking at your report for FLUID-5145
2013-09-20T17:19:15 <Bosmon> I am wondering whether this issue has anything to do with boiled events, or whether it is an issue at all : P
2013-09-20T17:19:25 <Bosmon> As far as I can see, you are firing an event once, and expecting to listen to it twice
2013-09-20T17:19:31 * avtar has quit
2013-09-20T17:19:31 <Bosmon> Is this not the case?
2013-09-20T17:19:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. that\'s the case.. off of the parent and off of the child..
2013-09-20T17:20:28 <Bosmon> So naturally the framework "halts" since it is waiting for you to do something which causes the 2nd listener to fire
2013-09-20T17:21:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it works fine for the boiled event in the child.. the child\'s listener will fire
2013-09-20T17:21:33 * avtar joined the channel
2013-09-20T17:21:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - quite
2013-09-20T17:21:53 <Bosmon> But somehow you are expecting it to fire TWICE
2013-09-20T17:21:55 <Bosmon> Can you explain why?
2013-09-20T17:21:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so if you were to reverse the order of the sequence.. the child event would fire but it will still halt at the parent
2013-09-20T17:22:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m expecting it to fire once
2013-09-20T17:22:07 <Bosmon> What do you mean by "halt at the parent"
2013-09-20T17:22:11 <Justin_o> but to be listened to by both
2013-09-20T17:22:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you have two listener records in a row in your test sequence
2013-09-20T17:22:23 <Bosmon> Which implies you expect two firings
2013-09-20T17:22:39 <Bosmon> Your test fixture contains this:
2013-09-20T17:22:40 <Bosmon> listener: "fluid.tests.checkEvent",
2013-09-20T17:22:41 <Bosmon> event: "{boiledEventComp}.child.events.testEvent"
2013-09-20T17:22:41 <Bosmon> }, {
2013-09-20T17:22:41 <Bosmon> listener: "fluid.tests.checkEvent",
2013-09-20T17:22:41 <Bosmon> event: "{boiledEventComp}.child.events.testEvent"
2013-09-20T17:22:41 <Bosmon> }]
2013-09-20T17:22:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i want to trigger the event to fire once.. but to listen to it from both the parent and from the child
2013-09-20T17:22:54 <Bosmon> This represents two event firings in sequence
2013-09-20T17:23:02 <Bosmon> but there is nothing to cause the 2nd firing
2013-09-20T17:23:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there no way to test what i\'m trying to do without having to trigger it twice
2013-09-20T17:23:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - two listeners, two firings : P
2013-09-20T17:24:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way.. if i had two child components that boiled the same event from the parent, they would both be listened to
2013-09-20T17:24:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have this working in some code I\'m presently writing for FLUID-5131
2013-09-20T17:24:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it only has a problem listening to the event directly from the parent
2013-09-20T17:25:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does that make sense?
2013-09-20T17:26:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s an example from what i\'m working on http://pastie.org/private/isk5lz6ikzdmp6lsnxfv7g
2013-09-20T17:26:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m not sure it does - can you write a test case demonstrating it? : P
2013-09-20T17:26:13 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-20T17:27:20 <Bosmon> Are you saying that you can\'t register a listener for {boiledEventComp}.events.testEvent ?
2013-09-20T17:27:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2013-09-20T17:29:13 <Bosmon> CouldCould you produce a test case for that?
2013-09-20T17:36:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i see why you were confused. I had accidentally committed both listeners bound to the same event. I had done this to test something quickly and guess forgot to change it back. I\'ve fixed it up and expanded the tests now.
2013-09-20T17:37:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully it will make more sense this time
2013-09-20T17:45:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is it not possible to use an expander for distribute options?
2013-09-20T17:46:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - in general, since it would be ambiguous whether you wanted to distribute the expander itself or its results
2013-09-20T17:46:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o, cindyli - I wanted to warn against what seems to be a general tendency towards "overuse" of the IoC testing system
2013-09-20T17:47:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what would classify as an overuse
2013-09-20T17:47:13 <Bosmon> In general it is only appropriate for use where there are events which are ASYNCHRONOUS whereas I am tending to find it used in "any cases which have something to do with events"
2013-09-20T17:47:35 <Bosmon> So for example, in cindyli\'s recent test cases for the ModelRelay system, the use was not necessary, since all of these events are clearly synchronous
2013-09-20T17:48:16 <Bosmon> And for example, Justin_o\'s recent FLUID-5145 test was overcomplicated by the use of the IoC testing framework, which obscured the real issue
2013-09-20T17:49:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i thought it was also needed for testing event sequences.. mind you i could have done mine more basically
2013-09-20T17:49:12 <cindyli> Bosmon: i thought we intend to deprecate the old way of writing unit tests and replace it with IoC testing system
2013-09-20T17:49:21 <Bosmon> In general an IoC testing framework fixture corresponds to a SEPARATE AND ASYNCHRONOUSLY OCCURING instant in time - and so naturally it is not possible to write fixtures which are trying to test two different results from the same event firing
2013-09-20T17:49:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - that is not correct!
2013-09-20T17:49:35 <Bosmon> The IoC testing framework is only useful for specialised situations
2013-09-20T17:49:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: although it might have been hard for me to know when to terminate my test
2013-09-20T17:49:50 <Justin_o> since it loops through the same events 3 times
2013-09-20T17:50:08 <Bosmon> Before you use it, ask yourself - is there genuine asynchrony in the situation - that is - does it involve either i) user interaction via the DOM, or ii) AJAX requests
2013-09-20T17:50:36 <Bosmon> If it does not, it is much better to use more simple techniques, for example, those similar to the "fireRecord" approach that you can see in the IoC tests themselves
2013-09-20T17:51:05 <Bosmon> If you search through FluidIoCTests.js, you will find various references to a member called "fireRecord" - the idea is that each listener pushes a record onto the end of this list, and at the end of the test, its contents are checked with a call to "jqUnit.assertDeepEq"
2013-09-20T17:51:40 <Bosmon> For situations without genuine asynchrony this is a much more straightforward approach that is capable of testing more things - for example Justin_o\'s "one event two listeners" issue
2013-09-20T17:51:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i don\'t think it was entirely clear about only using the IoC testing framework for these special cases
2013-09-20T17:51:53 <Bosmon> You could express your "don\'t care indeterminism" by having both listeners push the same record
2013-09-20T17:52:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sorry it wasn\'t clear - we should write it up better in that case!
2013-09-20T17:52:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ^
2013-09-20T17:52:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon, anastasiac, maybe we can add it to the list of doc tasks
2013-09-20T17:53:02 <Bosmon> The IoC testing framework is primarily aimed at a certain class of "integration testing tasks"
2013-09-20T17:53:17 <anastasiac> I will review the logs and figure out what you want to add to the list :-)
2013-09-20T17:53:19 <Bosmon> Usually where some substantial kind of application is taken through various interaction cycles, which involve some asynchronous activity
2013-09-20T17:53:37 <Bosmon> For example, yzen would have found it useful in testing CSpace interactions, and kasparnet finds it useful for his GPII integration tests
2013-09-20T17:53:59 <Bosmon> But it isn\'t to be used in more low-level unit testing scenarios, unless for some reason these involve a lot of asynchrony and sequence
2013-09-20T17:54:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll re-write my tests to use the "fireRecord" strategy
2013-09-20T17:55:14 <anastasiac> Justin_o, are you able to give me a one or two sentence summary of what you want documented?
2013-09-20T17:56:32 <Justin_o> anastasiac: Basically that the IoC Testing framework is only for integration testing requiring asynchrony.
2013-09-20T17:56:52 * ramil joined the channel
2013-09-20T17:57:00 <anastasiac> okley, thanks Justin_o, that helps :-)
2013-09-20T17:57:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: and that for other cases the old style should be used, can also look at the fireRecord approach used in FluidIoCTests.js for testing events that don\'t require asynchony
2013-09-20T17:57:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2013-09-20T17:57:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: So I have some more questions for you related to the distribute options
2013-09-20T17:57:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I had a brief look over your invoker docs - they are looking good!
