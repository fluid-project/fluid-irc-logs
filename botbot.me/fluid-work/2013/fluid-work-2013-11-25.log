b'2013-11-25T20:22:10 <Bosmon> anastasiac - UIO already includes an infrastructure for this, the "onSignificantDOMChange" event which is operated by the "separated panel"
2013-11-25T20:22:39 <Bosmon> As well as fixing the CSS for the scrollbars, we should adjust the panel rendering infrastructure to fire this event automatically
2013-11-25T20:22:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o ^
2013-11-25T20:22:47 <anastasiac> ah, Bosmon, I didn\'t know about that
2013-11-25T20:23:06 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I can\'t commit the pull in its current form, since the interaction is sort of unusable : P
2013-11-25T20:24:03 <Bosmon> It seems it is automatically fired by the updateView method
2013-11-25T20:24:40 <Bosmon> Which is itself called by "afterPanelShow" and "onReset"
2013-11-25T20:24:58 <Bosmon> Fixing the issue ought to be as simple as binding it to a further rendering event in the hierarchy
2013-11-25T20:25:19 <anastasiac> Bosmon, you mean the onSignificantDOMChange is currently being fired?
2013-11-25T20:25:22 <Bosmon> I think this would be a good opportunity to refactor the fluid.prefs.separatedPanel.bindEvents method which is very oldfashioned
2013-11-25T20:25:30 <Bosmon> anastasiac - it is fired by the two methods I mentioned
2013-11-25T20:25:40 <Bosmon> But clearly it needs to be fired on more occasions
2013-11-25T20:25:57 <Bosmon> All of this implementation is in the SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.js which seems in need of a good renovation :)
2013-11-25T20:25:58 <anastasiac> so is this a fix that needs to be carried out in the framework? or is it the instructional demo that needs to listen for the event and do something?
2013-11-25T20:26:09 <Bosmon> Of course it must be in the framework : P
2013-11-25T20:26:16 <Bosmon> We\'re not going to expect panel authors to know about this obscure event....
2013-11-25T20:26:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon, anastasiac: just on a call at the moment, but i\'ll check back in with you about the change in a little bit
2013-11-25T20:26:33 <anastasiac> ok, that\'s what I thought, but I wasn\'t sure - just want to make sure my understanding is correct
2013-11-25T20:26:33 <Bosmon> But I\'m surprised we haven\'t run into this issue more often
2013-11-25T20:26:40 <anastasiac> you know what they say about "assume"\xe2\x80\xa6 :-)
2013-11-25T20:37:45 * yzen joined the channel
2013-11-25T20:37:50 <Bosmon> I don\'t think it\'s much of an assumption to assume we should deliver things that work : P
2013-11-25T20:42:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m back
2013-11-25T20:42:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  just going to read over the conversation
2013-11-25T20:42:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve entered a summary on the FLUID-5220 pull request
2013-11-25T20:43:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2013-11-25T20:43:08 <Justin_o> i\'ll read that instead
2013-11-25T20:44:13 <Bosmon> When you make your fix, it\'s ok to just append it to the FLUID-5220 branch to save time
2013-11-25T20:44:20 <Bosmon> We can treat this as a "giant integration branch"
2013-11-25T20:45:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks.. that\'ll be easier
2013-11-25T20:45:18 <Bosmon> It\'s actually not all that unrelated to the DOM binding issue in any case
2013-11-25T20:46:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i take it i just need to fire that event as a result of onDomBind in the case of conditional panel
2013-11-25T20:46:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s one possibility, yes
2013-11-25T20:47:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  okay.. and as for the fluid.prefs.separatedPanel.bindEvents function.. you just want that made declarative?
2013-11-25T20:47:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2013-11-25T20:47:32 <Bosmon> It should make it easier to bind onto the "extra event" in any case
2013-11-25T20:47:37 <Justin_o> okay.. on it.. i\'ll also try to look into the scrollbar issue.. but not really sure what\'s up with that
2013-11-25T20:47:38 <Bosmon> Since otherwise it is just a dependency risk
2013-11-25T20:47:48 <Justin_o> ah okay
2013-11-25T20:48:23 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s reasonable to imagine that "onDomBind" corresponds to all of the remaining cases of a "significant DOM change"
2013-11-25T20:48:32 <Bosmon> But that depends on your understanding of the arcthiecture
2013-11-25T20:48:36 <Bosmon> architecture
2013-11-25T20:49:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean that onSignificantDomChange would be switched to onDomBind?
2013-11-25T20:49:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what does that mean?
2013-11-25T20:50:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess i don\'t fully know what you mean :)
2013-11-25T20:51:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the "significant DOM change" event was meant to be a reasonably coarse-grained signalling of some DOM change that would cause a major change in layout
2013-11-25T20:51:31 <Bosmon> Which we imagine corresponds to an execution of the renderer
2013-11-25T20:52:00 <Bosmon> If you\'re confident that "onDomBind" correlated with all of those, and won\'t fire unnecessarily too many times, then indeed you should just gear one event to the other
2013-11-25T20:52:05 <Bosmon> Using a listener
2013-11-25T20:54:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay..
2013-11-25T20:54:20 <Justin_o> not remove onSignificatnDOMChange and replace it with onDomBind
2013-11-25T20:54:25 <Justin_o> both would still exist
2013-11-25T20:54:31 <Bosmon> Certainly not
2013-11-25T20:54:32 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-11-25T20:54:45 <Justin_o> okay. i\'ll explore that
2013-11-25T20:55:09 <Justin_o> i\'m going to try to modernize bindEvents first to make sure i don\'t break thins inadverently
2013-11-25T20:55:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - good plan!
2013-11-25T20:56:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  And to recap from the other day.. in the ginger world.. if i use {subComponent} where the subComponent is created with a createOnEvent.. it won\'t try to create the subComponent ahead of time to resolve that IoC reference?
2013-11-25T20:57:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s correct, yes
2013-11-25T20:57:39 <Bosmon> You can\'t force evaluation of a "createOnEvent" component - it is entirely invisible until the event occurs
2013-11-25T20:58:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks.. so that will resolve to undefined or it won\'t resolve at all until it is created?
2013-11-25T20:58:18 <Bosmon> If there is actually a path component, I believe the framework will even give you an error
2013-11-25T20:58:26 <Bosmon> That is, {component}.path for a nonexistent component is an error
2013-11-25T20:58:40 <Bosmon> Just {component} itself for a nonexistent component will give you a value or undefined, and no error
2013-11-25T20:59:14 <Bosmon> Yes, {component}.path for no component will give you this:
2013-11-25T20:59:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so how would i make use of it.. since i\'ll need to pass in subcomponents in as arguments to the listeners of others
2013-11-25T20:59:15 <Bosmon> fluid.fail("Failed to resolve reference " + ref + " - could not match context with name "
2013-11-25T20:59:15 <Bosmon> + context + " from component " + fluid.dumpThat(parentThat), parentThat);
2013-11-25T20:59:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay
2013-11-25T20:59:30 <Justin_o> seen that error before..
2013-11-25T20:59:39 <Justin_o> but what is the correct way around it?
2013-11-25T20:59:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the correct way around it is to properly organise your dependencies :)
2013-11-25T21:00:35 <Justin_o> :) okay.. so as long as the other component is created before. The resolution will happen at creation time
2013-11-25T21:00:45 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-11-25T21:01:01 <Justin_o> okay.. i\'ll just try to sort out the timing of these subcomopnents
2013-11-25T21:01:07 <Bosmon> You shouldn\'t be issuing references to components which you aren\'t sure exist
2013-11-25T21:01:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what timing issue are you thinking of in particular?
2013-11-25T21:01:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: looks like these subcomponents are all created at different times and listeners for one will need to call actions on another
2013-11-25T21:02:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - a great reason to sort out the mess in the "bindEvents" method : P
2013-11-25T21:02:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. it takes advantage of being called after everything is done
2013-11-25T21:03:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s acceptable to move all this material into a dedicated "event binding component" if the timing gets too complicated
2013-11-25T21:03:26 <Bosmon> And have that component "createOnEvent" after the lastest thing that it refers to
2013-11-25T21:03:44 <Bosmon> But it may be possible to factor out this material into parts which can be bound straightforwardly and declaratively
2013-11-25T21:03:57 <Bosmon> That is, the contents of this method probably need to be sent out to a number of different locations
2013-11-25T21:04:03 <Bosmon> So keeping it all together may not be the right answer
2013-11-25T21:05:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. trying to break it all out first

2013-11-25T20:14:01 <Justin_o> sorry.. i\'m back now
2013-11-25T20:14:10 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o, it\'s ok, I have worked it out
2013-11-25T20:14:16 <Bosmon> How was the FLOE meeting?
2013-11-25T20:15:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it was okay.. we still need to work out what the demo will actually be though..
2013-11-25T20:15:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think we\'ll need to do more talking on that
2013-11-25T20:18:49 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2013-11-25T20:19:05 <Bosmon> I am testing out FLUID-5220 and there is a significant rendering problem with the instructional demos
2013-11-25T20:19:08 <Bosmon> I guess this is an issue for anastasiac

2013-11-25T20:19:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :( really
2013-11-25T20:19:40 <Justin_o> is it the expansion of the panels?
2013-11-25T20:19:42 <Bosmon> If I bring up the conditional preferences demo in its initial condition, and then turn the preference to "on", no scrollbar appears and the panel does not adjust its height
2013-11-25T20:19:46 <Bosmon> Yes, it is the expansion of the panels
2013-11-25T20:20:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i think anastasiac was going to talk to you and maybe vjoanna about that.. can\'t remember now
2013-11-25T20:20:12 <Bosmon> As well as that, there is an unnecessary appearance of a disabed horizonal scrollbar in the panel
2013-11-25T20:20:15 <anastasiac> Bosmon, yes, you\'re right, that\'s a problem with the instructional demos. I haven\'t yet figured out a solution for that
