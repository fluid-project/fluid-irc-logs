b'2013-11-14T18:47:09 <Bosmon7> So you mentioned that the current behaviour does actually seem to "accidentally" be what you want?
2013-11-14T18:47:18 <Bosmon7> That the model relay happens first and change listeners happen afterwards?
2013-11-14T18:47:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i believe so.. let me test that out again
2013-11-14T18:48:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: it could also just be that they happen to get attached after
2013-11-14T18:48:26 <Bosmon7> Given how complex this is seeming, it may well be better to just "depend on the accident" for as long as it seems to be working, and for me to try to get the new impl working as quickly as possible
2013-11-14T18:48:31 <Bosmon7> Although this can\'t happen before next week
2013-11-14T18:49:17 * mrvisser has quit
2013-11-14T18:51:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i see.. yes.. i can understand that this would take time.. the sad news is that i\'m not sure i can actually rework the code to use the current style. I don\'t know if i can convert this https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/ecd1475ed32437d14b00c171cbb77a675d76e3f8/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L322-L330
2013-11-14T18:51:56 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - ah, you\'re saying that the sequencing works if the listeners are added manually, but not through the declarative system?
2013-11-14T18:52:03 <Justin_o> the main problem being that addListener takes a function and you can see here i am relying on IoC to get values
2013-11-14T18:52:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yep
2013-11-14T18:52:17 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - urgh
2013-11-14T18:52:30 <Justin_o> yes.. exactly :(
2013-11-14T18:52:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i also have another strange issue to talk to you about after this one
2013-11-14T18:53:16 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it doesn\'t seem like it would be too hard to massage this block so that it became a traditional crummy onCreate block that calls "addListener" ......
2013-11-14T18:54:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: where i\'m getting stumped is that i don\'t know ahead of time what the values are and i\'m constructing IoC declarations to get the values
2013-11-14T18:54:36 <Justin_o> addListener would take a function
2013-11-14T18:55:28 <Justin_o> i figure i could get around that reasonably with an invoker, except for the componentNames
2013-11-14T18:55:45 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - fine...... you can generate a thing which calls addListener on the configuration after it has manually supplied it to fluid.expandOptoins
2013-11-14T18:55:48 <Justin_o> unless i put that into the components options
2013-11-14T18:55:48 <Bosmon7> expandOptions
2013-11-14T18:56:04 <Bosmon7> This will certainly stand out as a piece of flimsy rubbish to be replaced when the new framework arrives : P
2013-11-14T18:58:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: where would i put that in the component tree?
2013-11-14T18:59:29 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - you will make some standalone utility function, and generate a call to it in the onCreate block of the component
2013-11-14T18:59:48 <Bosmon7> One of the arguments to it will be the component\'s "that" which can then be used to call fluid.expandOptions to generate the model listener
2013-11-14T19:01:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: you mean modify the listeners after the fact
2013-11-14T19:01:28 <Justin_o> ?
2013-11-14T19:02:18 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes, you will generate an onCreate listener which will just call "addListener" in the old conventional way which you have found to work
2013-11-14T19:02:34 <Bosmon7> And you will expand the IoC configuration supplied in order to generate the listener by hand
2013-11-14T19:02:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sure i\'ll do that.. i might just put an object in the options that has the info i need to generate it
2013-11-14T19:03:11 <anastasiac> say, yzen, can you give me an ETA on CSpace information, so that I can do some planning of my time?
2013-11-14T19:03:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: oh i see
2013-11-14T19:03:38 <yzen> anastasiac: eod today
2013-11-14T19:03:52 <anastasiac> ok, thanks yzen
2013-11-14T19:03:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. i\'ll get to that then..
2013-11-14T19:04:25 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - good luck!
2013-11-14T19:04:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: do you have time to hear the second problem?
2013-11-14T19:04:27 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-11-14T19:04:28 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes
2013-11-14T19:06:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so the second issue is regarding the rendering of the sub panels.. i\'m not really sure what\'s causing this as my unit tests were passing... but what it looks like is that if the conditional sub panel is created on initialization of the composite panel, it creates and destroys fine, but for those that are not created yet.. they don\'t get created
2013-11-14T19:06:25 <Justin_o> afterwards...
2013-11-14T19:07:25 * greggy has quit
2013-11-14T19:07:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: that\'s not quite correct.. the sub panels are created, but their markup isn\'t properly rendered out
2013-11-14T19:08:02 <Justin_o> but if they are created on init, they do work properly even after being destroyed and recreated
2013-11-14T19:08:25 <Justin_o> and there are no errors being thrown
2013-11-14T19:08:26 <Bosmon7> What do you mean by "don\'t work properly"
2013-11-14T19:08:39 <Bosmon7> It\'s not a very good bug report :)
2013-11-14T19:10:11 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-11-14T19:10:30 <Justin_o> yes.. sorry.. i\'m still trying to get a grasp on this one...
2013-11-14T19:11:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: it might be easier to try this example from anastasiac\'s branch https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/PFID/src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/conditional.html
2013-11-14T19:11:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: but it looks like just the template is getting rendered for sub panels
2013-11-14T19:12:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: however, if those sub panels are shown when the composite panel is created.. that is, if the model value they are dependent on is true when the composite panel is created, they render correctly
2013-11-14T19:13:11 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I might have to leave you to debug that one for yourself :)
2013-11-14T19:13:16 <Bosmon7> Since I am a bit running out of time ....
2013-11-14T19:14:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yah no problem.. i get the first part fixed up and try to come back to this one
2013-11-14T19:15:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the strange thing though is that the produce tree seems to be the same in both cases.. so i\'m not really sure what could be going wrong
2013-11-14T19:15:39 <Justin_o> hmm.. i wonder if it might have to do with cutpoints
2013-11-14T19:15:46 <Justin_o> anyways.. i\'ll keep trying
2013-11-14T19:16:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks for the help

2013-11-14T20:06:12 * jhung has quit
2013-11-14T20:06:23 <Aver> The documentation is lacking any instructions but mediaelementjs falls back properly and I am unable to find out how to make that work..
2013-11-14T20:12:57 * colinclark_ joined the channel
2013-11-14T20:13:57 <Aver> Hello?
2013-11-14T20:15:05 * colinclark has quit
2013-11-14T20:15:05 * colinclark_ is now known as colinclark
2013-11-14T20:16:52 * greggy joined the channel
2013-11-14T20:18:20 <colinclark> Hi Aver
2013-11-14T20:18:27 <colinclark> I\'m not sure the answer to your question off the top of my head
2013-11-14T20:18:36 <colinclark> but anastasiac might know, she\'s used it quite a bit
2013-11-14T20:19:05 <Aver> Ok
2013-11-14T20:19:26 <Aver> We are trying to integrate the FLOE player and was hoping that because it used MediaElementJS it would handle FLV files nicely..
2013-11-14T20:19:37 <colinclark> But you\'re right, our use of MediaElement.js should ensure FLV playback, yes
2013-11-14T20:19:38 <Aver> however, we are unable to determine how to play FLV (can\'t find any documentation)
2013-11-14T20:19:49 <colinclark> Have you tried it yet?
2013-11-14T20:20:01 <Aver> BTW great job on the accessibility of the video player :) Its very impressive
2013-11-14T20:20:10 <colinclark> Oh, thanks!
2013-11-14T20:20:28 <colinclark> What project will you be using the Video Player in?
2013-11-14T20:21:31 <Aver> Were evaluating it to be the standard video player for our LMS :)
2013-11-14T20:22:28 <colinclark> ah, cool
2013-11-14T20:22:30 <colinclark> Which LMS?
2013-11-14T20:25:58 <anastasiac> hi, Aver. I apologize for the lack of documentation for the video player. It\'s still in its relatively early stages. We haven\'t tested with FLV, but as colinclark said, it should work. I\'m guessing you\'ve tried it and it doesn\'t?
2013-11-14T20:26:24 <Aver> Ya
2013-11-14T20:26:53 <Aver> There doesn\'t seem to be a source renderer for video/flv
2013-11-14T20:27:03 <Aver> Were evaluating it for D2L
2013-11-14T20:27:09 <colinclark> Aha
2013-11-14T20:27:34 <colinclark> Say hi to all my friends there for me :)
2013-11-14T20:27:52 <Aver> I will Sandra introduced us to this lovely player :)
2013-11-14T20:28:00 <colinclark> awesome
2013-11-14T20:28:04 <colinclark> Do you work with Sean Yo as well?
2013-11-14T20:28:10 <Aver> hes on my team
2013-11-14T20:28:21 <Aver> :)
2013-11-14T20:28:58 <anastasiac> Aver, cindyli may be able to correct me if I\'m wrong, but I believe the source renderer might be pluggable, which means if it should be straightforward to add a flash renderer
2013-11-14T20:28:58 <Aver> Anastasiac do you know where we could look to fix the flash support ? We could look at contributing a fix but were not entirely sure where to look..

2013-11-14T20:31:42 <Aver> ok perfect

2013-11-14T20:50:08 * greggy joined the channel
2013-11-14T20:53:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sadly it seems i was wrong.. even adding the listeners with a call to addListener happens before the model relay
2013-11-14T21:17:16 * cindyli has quit
2013-11-14T21:24:00 <anastasiac> Aver, the video player has no trouble with flv, you just need to set an option to help it recognize the type of "video/flv"; the default source renderer will work
2013-11-14T21:25:03 <anastasiac> Aver, this gist shows you what the option should look like: https://gist.github.com/acheetham/7474477
2013-11-14T21:25:26 <anastasiac> just add that to the options block passed as the second argument to fluid.videoPlayer()
2013-11-14T21:25:30 <anastasiac> Aver, does that make sense?
2013-11-14T21:27:00 <anastasiac> alternatively, the actual fix to the video player itself would be done in VIdeoPlayer_media.js, in the sourceRenderers block defined at line 109 or thereabouts
2013-11-14T21:29:05 <anastasiac> Aver, I\'ve filed an issue for this: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/VP-320

2013-11-14T18:09:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello
2013-11-14T18:11:57 <Bosmon7> hi Justin_o
2013-11-14T18:13:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m trying to fix up some issues that anastasiac has found with the FLUID-5205 branch.. The first issue is that you need to toggle the value for a controlling adjuster (one that will change a model value and control the creation/destruction of other adjusters)
2013-11-14T18:13:47 <Justin_o> the issue is that for the conditional panels.. we rerender the panel on certain model changes.. the problem though is that this refreshing happens before the  model relay takes place.. the result is that the control that triggered the model change is rerendered with its old value
2013-11-14T18:14:38 <Justin_o> if there was a way to set the priority of the modelListeners i could probably get around the issue.. do you know of any other alternative if this isn\'t possible?
2013-11-14T18:20:00 <Bosmon7> Ok, fine
2013-11-14T18:20:22 <Bosmon7> I can reveal that under the current ChangeApplier implementation, priorities for modelListeners "probably" work
2013-11-14T18:20:29 <Bosmon7> Although I had been planning to abolish this facility
2013-11-14T18:21:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: does that mean i\'ll have to switch back to the old style?
2013-11-14T18:22:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: or can we expect priorities to come back shortly?

2013-11-14T18:24:29 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - sorry, it appears that priorities are not available even with the old impl
2013-11-14T18:24:37 <Bosmon7> Even though it would have been easy in theory for it to support them
2013-11-14T18:24:42 * SonicX has quit
2013-11-14T18:24:45 * SonicX_ has quit
2013-11-14T18:24:50 <Bosmon7> The relevant part of the record is not passed through in the ChangeApplier\'s "addListener" function
2013-11-14T18:25:19 <Bosmon7> It should be in the 4th argument position, but the ChangeApplier hardwires it to null
2013-11-14T18:25:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i see... is there a change in when these things are fired.. i think i did make a quick test and it seemed that listers bound to the changeApplier would fire after the source guard that the model relay uses
2013-11-14T18:26:36 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - this kind of thing shouldn\'t be depended on
2013-11-14T18:27:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: right.. any suggestions on what to do about it, in this case?
2013-11-14T18:28:59 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it\'s disagreeable, but I would suggest setting up a "bottling relay"
2013-11-14T18:29:13 <Bosmon7> That is, something which collects up change events in batches and then refires them at a particular lifecycle point
2013-11-14T18:29:14 <Justin_o> "bottling relay" ?
2013-11-14T18:29:52 <Justin_o> i\'m not really sure where to begin with that :)
2013-11-14T18:30:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: one thing is that the listeners are bound from different components
2013-11-14T18:31:18 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it will be relatively easy, given the facilities in JavaScript :)
2013-11-14T18:31:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: if you have time and are interested, you can try out the case that anastasia came up with https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/PFID/src/instructionalDemos/framework/preferences/compositeSchemas/conditional.html
2013-11-14T18:31:40 <Bosmon7> All you need to do is to create a "thing" that has the same addListener/removeListener signature as the changeApplier\'s modelChanged event
2013-11-14T18:31:52 <Bosmon7> But which wraps all the listeners supplied with the "bottling logic"
2013-11-14T18:33:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: do you mean to create another thing like the modelRelay?
2013-11-14T18:34:13 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - very similar, yes, although not as complex
2013-11-14T18:34:21 <Bosmon7> Since it won\'t do any "rebasing" of the changes or model structure
2013-11-14T18:34:33 <Bosmon7> It will just store the arguments that are supplied to the listeners and reproduce them later
2013-11-14T18:34:46 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-11-14T18:36:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: how would i know when to reproduce them?
2013-11-14T18:37:08 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - they would be triggered by a "conventional event"
2013-11-14T18:37:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i guess i actually mean "when" since i\'ve been waiting for the model change event.. i\'m not sure what else to wait for :)
2013-11-14T18:38:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: in the end i guess it would be easier just to listen to the sub panel\'s model change event instead of the composite panel\'s
2013-11-14T18:38:38 * Bosmon7 has quit
2013-11-14T18:38:55 <Justin_o> but the path is different :(
2013-11-14T18:39:01 <Justin_o> model path that is
2013-11-14T18:39:09 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2013-11-14T18:39:15 <Bosmon7> It\'s the whole fact that there is a conventional event which creates the seequence point
2013-11-14T18:39:28 <Bosmon7> So you may as well turn it into an advantage : P
2013-11-14T18:40:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sadly i\'m not following.. the start of the change is triggered by a model change event as a result of value binding from the renderer
2013-11-14T18:41:16 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes
2013-11-14T18:41:34 <Bosmon7> This model change event apparently is geared into a re-rendering event and via the creation and destruction of some components
2013-11-14T18:41:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes
2013-11-14T18:42:06 <Bosmon7> So this re-rendering then creates a "conventional sequence point" - or if it doesn\'t, you could easily create one
2013-11-14T18:42:28 <Bosmon7> Oh, I see.... it is the rendering activity itself which you want to sequence
2013-11-14T18:42:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: but it\'s precisely this binding that is the problem since the model relay that is also waiting on it
2013-11-14T18:42:35 <Bosmon7> yes, ok
2013-11-14T18:42:51 <Bosmon7> Well, model relay, as in the "new framework", needs to get fast-tracked relative to everything else
2013-11-14T18:42:56 <Bosmon7> ok
2013-11-14T18:43:11 <Bosmon7> So this actually suggests that we should fix up cindyli\'s modelRelay to act more similarly to the upcoming one
2013-11-14T18:43:25 <Bosmon7> In fact, the videoPlayer\'s relay does indeed do this kind of "bottling"
2013-11-14T18:43:37 <Bosmon7> So our "temporary impl" is starting to become more and more similar to our other "temporary impl"
