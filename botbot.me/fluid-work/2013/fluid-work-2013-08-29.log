b'2013-08-29T18:35:01 <Justin_o> michelled: do you have any thoughts on the svg issue ?
2013-08-29T18:36:33 <cindyli> replacing images === removing + adding, sounds like code change is more preferrable
2013-08-29T18:37:21 <michelled> I don\'t have an opinion Justin_o
2013-08-29T18:37:24 <jhung> We wouldn\'t want to replace the SVGs.
2013-08-29T18:37:30 <michelled> are you leaning one way?
2013-08-29T18:37:42 <jhung> SVGs scale nicely when enlarged etc.
2013-08-29T18:40:35 <Justin_o> michelled, cindyli, jhung: i guess my biggest struggle with all of this is what cost are we putting on ourselves and the repo to add support to a browser we don\'t officially support. I guess I\'d lean towards whichever solution preserved the features/quality we want for our supported browsers and mitigated any additional burdens.
2013-08-29T18:42:39 <cindyli> Justin_o: in order to use "svg web" library, SVGs need to be placed on the page instead of the background, then wrap each svg in a script tag, is that considered a burden?
2013-08-29T18:43:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: possibly i think heidiv and jhung made them background images for a specific reason, although i can\'t remember what
2013-08-29T18:43:52 <heidiv> Justin_o theming
2013-08-29T18:44:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: it could be that we just use the original swapping method you have in the pull request
2013-08-29T18:44:08 <Justin_o> if that\'s the best solution
2013-08-29T18:44:39 <cindyli> Justin_o: the swapping only works for png files, not svgs
2013-08-29T18:44:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: what do you mean?
2013-08-29T18:45:11 <cindyli> i mean for IE8
2013-08-29T18:45:40 <cindyli> svg files don\'t get displayed, to swap btw themes, svgs need to fall back onto pngs first
2013-08-29T18:45:53 * mrvisser has quit
2013-08-29T18:45:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: right
2013-08-29T18:46:06 <Justin_o> so we swap the svg\'s for png\'s in IE8
2013-08-29T18:46:15 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-08-29T18:46:20 * mrvisser has quit
2013-08-29T18:47:07 <cindyli> Justin_o: for 2 svg files, 6 new pngs need to be added to the repo. that\'s the origin you didn\'t like :)
2013-08-29T18:49:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. that\'s what i don\'t like about it.. but if there are no better solutions we can stick with it.. so i guess my question is.. are the others worse than this
2013-08-29T18:50:54 <cindyli> Justin_o: the other option is to use svg web library which needs: 1. SVGs need to be placed on the page instead of the background, 2. wrap each svg in a script tag
2013-08-29T18:51:13 <cindyli> but seems not using SVGs as background images would be a problem
2013-08-29T18:52:01 <Justin_o> heidiv: this is the case correct?
2013-08-29T18:52:59 <heidiv> Justin_o right now as bg imgs the css can handle all theming. otherwise we\'d have to swap images with js
2013-08-29T18:55:39 <Justin_o> heidiv: i see.. sounds similar to the issue cindy is looking at.. in that we\'d have to use js to swap images
2013-08-29T18:55:49 <cindyli> ok, option 2 is not applicable then
2013-08-29T18:56:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. are those the only two options then?
2013-08-29T18:56:05 <heidiv> Justin_o yeah, not ideal. difficult for themers
2013-08-29T18:56:30 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o

2013-08-29T20:08:00 <heidiv> hi clown, i\'m researching what sort of aria would be helpful for the UI options panel, that hides/shows by sliding up and down. have you encountered this behaviour before and how to make it accessible. it\'s sort of similar to a tabbed accordian\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe bit of a stretch tho. or perhaps an alert of some kind?
2013-08-29T20:09:22 <clown> hi heidiv, I\'m in another conversation at the moment.  Yeah, on first blush, it sounds liike a tabbed panel.  But, let me get back to you.
2013-08-29T20:09:38 <heidiv> clown sounds good, thanks
2013-08-29T20:12:45 <heidiv> i\'m curious how aria-expanded works with AT\xe2\x80\xa6 if aria-expanded set to true alerts somehow
2013-08-29T20:21:00 * Justin_o has quit
2013-08-29T20:21:25 <clown> heidiv, I have a second of breather right now.  this might help.  it defines where aria-expanded can be used:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/states_and_properties#aria-expanded
2013-08-29T20:21:43 <clown> See the "Used in Roles" section of the table.
2013-08-29T20:22:04 <heidiv> yeah so the hide/show part would be role=region with aria-expanded true or false
2013-08-29T20:22:18 <clown> Also, note that the roles are like classes, in that they may have sub classs roles.
2013-08-29T20:22:37 <heidiv> which seems to make more sense than labelling the open/close button as a tab and the hide/show div as a tabpanel
2013-08-29T20:22:56 <heidiv> will have to see how screen readers deal w it
2013-08-29T20:23:14 <heidiv> i feel like there needs to be some sort of alert when the tab opens, but role=alert isn\'t quite right
2013-08-29T20:23:35 <clown> well, I\'d have to see it to understand that.  jquery has a vertical accordion, but it uses the tablist/tab/tabpanel pattern.
2013-08-29T20:23:56 * clown has to go back to his other conversation.
2013-08-29T20:25:22 <heidiv> clown http://fluidproject.org/releases/1.4/demos/uiOptions/html/uiOptions.html  has a demo of UIO - the "show prefs" tab/button at the top displays UIO
2013-08-29T20:29:50 <clown> heidiv:  http://hanshillen.github.io/jqtest/#goto_accordion
2013-08-29T20:30:12 * clown has to go back to his other conversation, again.  Experiencing ADD...
2013-08-29T20:31:34 <heidiv> clown we can wait till convo #1 is done\xe2\x80\xa6 no rush :)
2013-08-29T20:31:38 <heidiv> the two demos i\'m comparing are:
2013-08-29T20:31:39 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-08-29T20:31:44 <heidiv> tabs: http://test.cita.illinois.edu/aria/tabpanel/tabpanel2.php
2013-08-29T20:32:03 <heidiv> hide/show region: http://test.cita.illinois.edu/aria/hideshow/hideshow1.php
2013-08-29T20:35:46 <heidiv> the 2nd example moves the focus with js to the region when the button is used
2013-08-29T20:38:37 <heidiv> the tab example doesn\'t do anything with focus, but when you move to the now-open tab-panel it says "expanded tab panel"
2013-08-29T20:39:23 <heidiv> with the example i sent you, when UIO tab is at the top and the panel slides down, the focus would still have to be moved to the beginning of the panel content. i\'m leaning toward the hide/show solution
2013-08-29T20:42:22 <clown> heidiv:  I\'ve looked at the uiOptions demo.  I\'m thinking that isn\'t really a tab panel.  If it is, it only has one tab.
2013-08-29T20:42:35 <heidiv> right
2013-08-29T20:42:41 <heidiv> it\'s not a tablist
2013-08-29T20:43:07 <clown> the cita examples have been superceded by the open ajax alliance examples.  Let me look \xe2\x80\x94 oh got to back to the other conversation, sorry.

2013-08-29T20:52:50 <heidiv> clown ok thanks!
2013-08-29T20:53:03 <clown> another one:  http://www.oaa-accessibility.org/example/21/
2013-08-29T20:53:08 <clown> heidiv ^
2013-08-29T20:53:30 <heidiv> clown tab v.s showable region - any last thoughts? :D
2013-08-29T20:54:25 <clown> nope.  not really thinking about it, heidiv.  most of my attention is in the other conversation.  I\'ll sleep on it, okay?
2013-08-29T20:54:36 <heidiv> clown sounds good, thanks!
2013-08-29T20:54:49 <clown> well, other than uiOptions is not a tablist.
2013-08-29T20:54:54 <heidiv> yeah

2013-08-29T16:35:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: i'm somewhat reluctant to pull in the png files unless we absolutely have to.. as binaries in git aren't great
2013-08-29T16:36:00 <cindyli> understood
2013-08-29T16:36:45 <Justin_o> cindyli: are there any other alternatives.. also do we know what size we'd want for them if we do need to keep the png's.. perhaps jhung might have some thoughts on that

2013-08-29T16:39:05 <cindyli> Justin_o: i tried to use a library to add the svg support for non-html5 browser, but it didn't work. I can look up more to see if there are other libraries doing this.
2013-08-29T16:39:24 <Justin_o> jhung: also do you know why we have png versions of the existing images still in the repo
2013-08-29T16:40:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: if we aren't going to be adding more images to this page, maybe it's not a huge issue..
2013-08-29T16:41:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: just want to think about it..
2013-08-29T16:41:34 <cindyli> Justin_o: will try
2013-08-29T16:42:12 <jhung> Justin_o: I don't know let me look.
2013-08-29T16:42:25 <Justin_o> i guess we should also clean up the images directory too
2013-08-29T16:44:05 <Justin_o> jhung: there are actually only a couple of svgs, most are png's already
2013-08-29T16:45:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: quick question what is the size of the library you looked at, vs the size the of these 6 pngs
2013-08-29T16:46:14 <cindyli> checking..
2013-08-29T16:47:44 <cindyli> Justin_o: the library i tried - http://raphaeljs.com/, its size is much smaller than pngs. but as said, didn't work.
2013-08-29T16:48:19 <cindyli> even if we need to try other libraries, generally, the size of js fie is much smaller than images anyway
2013-08-29T16:48:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: yah.. i think it's because it doesn't take in svg files directly
2013-08-29T16:48:27 <Justin_o> ah okay
2013-08-29T16:49:08 <Justin_o> maybe it's worth it then..
2013-08-29T16:49:39 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah, only 2 images are SVGs.
2013-08-29T16:51:49 <jhung> Justin_o: not sure if it's worthwhile to add those PNGs\xe2\x80\xa6 we'll be adding 6 in total (one for each theme).

2013-08-29T18:25:22 <cindyli> jhung and Justin_o, are there reasons that we cannot replace svg files used in DT with PNG files?
2013-08-29T18:26:37 <cindyli> the reason i'm ask is, after looking at the library to support svg display in IE8 - http://svgweb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/UserManual.html, replacing svg files seems the easiest
