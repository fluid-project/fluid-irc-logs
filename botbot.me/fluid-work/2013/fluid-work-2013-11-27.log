2013-11-27T17:27:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: anything i can help you with?
2013-11-27T17:27:44 <cindyli> Justin_o: wanna chat?
2013-11-27T17:28:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2013-11-27T17:39:02 <Justin_o> jhung, danaayotte_: cindyli basically has something that can determine what resource is based on the url\'s extension.. with this we should be able to direct the code to do different things.. but i guess we need to know what those are or might look like..
2013-11-27T17:40:53 <danaayotte_> need to know what the different media are, Justin_o?
2013-11-27T17:41:55 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: sure that would help too.. i think we are assuming image, audio, video, and text at the moment
2013-11-27T17:43:20 <danaayotte_> I wasn\'t sure what your question was Justin_o
2013-11-27T17:47:05 <Justin_o> danaayotte_: okay... so once we have determined what the resource type is, what\'s the next step? 1) auto-generate meta-data 2) display something like that?
2013-11-27T17:48:09 <danaayotte_> ah I see
2013-11-27T17:49:44 <danaayotte_> Justin_o: yes, we want to auto-generate what we can, display what we\'ve auto-generated, and make suggestions for additional, related features
2013-11-27T17:50:13 <jhung> Justin_o: is there any chance we determine a file incorrectly?
2013-11-27T17:51:06 <jhung> If yes, then the workflow may look something like this: Give URL > Detect media type > User makes refinement if wrong > generate good default > display it (whatever the display ends up looking like).
2013-11-27T17:53:01 <Justin_o> jhung: sure it\'s possible if 1) there\'s no file extension 2) the file extension is incorrect
2013-11-27T17:53:30 <jhung> Justin_o: okay, then the workflow I stated above should address that.
2013-11-27T18:00:03 <Justin_o> cindyli: how does that sound?
2013-11-27T18:00:46 <cindyli> looks good, Justin_o
2013-11-27T18:03:38 <michelled> colinclark: apparently we need to get the solutions registry online before the flow manager becomes useful. yzen thinks that we should have a conversation about this with Bosmon, sgithens and you :)
2013-11-27T18:03:42 <cindyli> jhung: so, we don\'t display the content that the url points to, but display the metadata that\'s auto generated based on the media type. is it right?
2013-11-27T18:04:53 <sgithens> michelled: Word.  Maybe next week? I\'m about to leave for the US Holiday
2013-11-27T18:04:56 <jhung> cindyli: we should do both.
2013-11-27T18:05:08 <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhung
2013-11-27T18:06:23 <jhung> cindyli for example, to refine or add additional metadata, the author will likely need to see / play / read it.

2013-11-27T18:24:04 <michelled> sounds good sgithens - have a good thanksgiving!
2013-11-27T18:24:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - Yes, I suspected that the code had already been in error before you began your refactoring

2013-11-27T18:43:35 <jhung> cindyli, Justin_o: another thing that we will need is - given 2 urls to resources, create the appropriate hasAdaptation and isAdaptationOf metadata. (see: http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility).
2013-11-27T18:44:43 <jhung> the purpose of this function would be to create the links / adaptation relationships between one resource URL to another URL.

2013-11-27T19:41:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what do you think of filing a separate jira for this one and getting the rest in?
2013-11-27T19:42:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - we can certainly leave the refactoring
2013-11-27T19:42:14 <Bosmon> But I think we do need to tackle the issue that the diagnostic raises
2013-11-27T19:42:27 <Bosmon> Since it risks the component producing unexpected failures in use

2013-11-27T20:32:49 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I\'ll have a look at it now
2013-11-27T20:33:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks so much...
2013-11-27T20:43:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2013-11-27T20:45:12 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I have merged it now
2013-11-27T20:45:22 <Bosmon> Congratulations on this long expanse of work :)
2013-11-27T20:48:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) thank you.. cindyli did a lot of work for that too..
2013-11-27T20:49:42 <michelled> wow! that\'s awesome :)
2013-11-27T20:50:57 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the Builder tests were removed in the latest branch(es) merged into master?
2013-11-27T20:51:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: prefs framework builder? or infusion builder?
2013-11-27T20:51:33 <anastasiac> prefs framework
2013-11-27T20:51:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: should be, are they missing?
2013-11-27T20:51:44 <anastasiac> hm
2013-11-27T20:51:44 <Justin_o> shouldn\'t be
2013-11-27T20:51:53 <anastasiac> ok, just a mix-up in my current branch, sorry
