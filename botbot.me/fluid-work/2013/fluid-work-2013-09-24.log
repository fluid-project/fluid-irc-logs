b'2013-09-24T20:07:54 <cindyli> i\'m creating a grade component that dynamically figures out which UIO template should be applied:
2013-09-24T20:07:54 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/videoPlayer/blob/VP-297/js/MediaSettings.js#L200-L244
2013-09-24T20:08:34 * jessm has quit
2013-09-24T20:08:42 <Bosmon> Intriguing use of IoC-driven console.log, cindyli :)
2013-09-24T20:09:03 <cindyli> ya, temporarily for debugging
2013-09-24T20:09:06 <cindyli> Note that the in the first link, templateLoader is passed down via distributeOptions
2013-09-24T20:09:48 <cindyli> the 2nd link, line 215, {that}.getTemplateLoaderGrade is not resolved in the instantiated UIO
2013-09-24T20:10:02 <Bosmon> Yes, this is an interesting situation
2013-09-24T20:10:10 <Bosmon> And I guess the one which we used to handle with demands blocks
2013-09-24T20:10:15 <Bosmon> Until they decided that they must be abolished
2013-09-24T20:10:18 <cindyli> exactly
2013-09-24T20:10:51 <Bosmon> I guess we still need at least some "little piece of framework" for this, just so people aren\'t constantly writing little functions with "if" in them
2013-09-24T20:11:15 <Bosmon> For example, I imagine you could achieve this effect using the progressiveEnhancement system
2013-09-24T20:12:35 <cindyli> ah, i certainly need to learn more about progressiveEnhancement system
2013-09-24T20:12:52 <cindyli> how do we do this with progressiveEnhancement system?
2013-09-24T20:13:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - this allows you to specify a set of "environmental checks" together with an "output grade"
2013-09-24T20:13:18 * Justin_o has quit
2013-09-24T20:13:19 <Bosmon> Which exactly replicates the effect of your "little function with if statements"
2013-09-24T20:13:57 <Bosmon> So what does your dynamic grade return, if not the right thing?
2013-09-24T20:13:58 <Bosmon> fluid.videoPlayer.getTemplateLoaderGrade
2013-09-24T20:14:16 <Bosmon> It looks as if it should be foolproof, given it doesn\'t seem to rely on its location in the component tree
2013-09-24T20:15:07 <cindyli> no, it only rely on a tag type in the static env
2013-09-24T20:17:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: i still don\'t know how I can make use of the "output grade" to come up with the dynamic grade for templateLoader, without a if statement and a demands block
2013-09-24T20:17:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - the progressiveEnhancer does it by itself
2013-09-24T20:20:04 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/enhancement/js/ProgressiveEnhancement.js#L109-L119
2013-09-24T20:20:16 <Bosmon> The array "checks" that you supply to it contain the tests you want made against the static environment
2013-09-24T20:21:01 <Bosmon> But - can you explain what does happen with your function "getTemplateLoaderGrade", compared with what should happen?
2013-09-24T20:23:40 <colinclark> Bosmon: Dude, we\'re chatting on IRC!
2013-09-24T20:23:54 <Bosmon> Yes, about some code you wrote 3 years ago :)
2013-09-24T20:23:59 <colinclark> oh no
2013-09-24T20:24:03 <colinclark> I\'m sorry :(
2013-09-24T20:24:05 <Bosmon> Why is it that colinclark\'s contributions always seem the subtlest : P
2013-09-24T20:24:20 <colinclark> aka the most subtly misfactored
2013-09-24T20:24:26 <Bosmon> No, it\'s fine... just trying to persuade cindyli she should use your progressiveChecker system
2013-09-24T20:25:15 * clown_mtg has quit
2013-09-24T20:25:39 <cindyli> ya, trying to understand how to use your progressiveChecker
2013-09-24T20:26:12 <colinclark> I always forget myself
2013-09-24T20:26:19 <colinclark> it\'s pretty intense
2013-09-24T20:26:25 <colinclark> but it works
2013-09-24T20:26:42 <Bosmon> It works, and it is mostly what we will have left once demands blocks are gone
2013-09-24T20:26:43 <cindyli> Bosmon: what happened is that, the gradeNames list in the final instantiated uio.templateLoader has "{that}.getTemplateLoaderGrade" as a grade, rather than the actual returned grade name.
2013-09-24T20:27:05 <cindyli> i will add this into the jira
2013-09-24T20:27:09 <Bosmon> Interestingly it always did seem to do the lion\'s share of the resolution work even when we had demands blocks
2013-09-24T20:27:53 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, I think I can believe that :)

2013-09-24T13:35:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks to Bosmon\'s suggestion of a dynamic grade, the distribute options are now working dynamically for FLUID-5131. The next step will be to combine templates. Bosmon suggested to use the renderer to combine the templates and dump the output to the template resourceText to be used by the actual rendering. I\'ll continue on to this today.
2013-09-24T13:36:19 <cindyli> nice. thanks for the update, Justin_o

2013-09-24T19:50:12 <Bosmon> Hey, Justin_o
2013-09-24T19:50:21 <Bosmon> How is stuff with the combined panels?
2013-09-24T19:53:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. it\'s coming along.. the dynamic grade for setting up the distribute options worked.. and here is the code i have for combining the templates.. i didn\'t use the jointID though https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5131/src/components/uiOptions/js/Panels.js#L182-L215
2013-09-24T19:56:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh yes, that\'s fine
2013-09-24T19:56:39 <Bosmon> I somehow "double-counted" in my mind yesterday :)
2013-09-24T19:56:54 <Bosmon> Clearly once you use the UIVerbatim approach, you don\'t ALSO need to use the UIJointContainer approach .......
2013-09-24T19:57:01 <Bosmon> Good job
2013-09-24T19:57:19 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks for your framework reports
2013-09-24T19:57:34 <Bosmon> FLUID-5151 is actually a known issue, but I\'ll make sure to deal with it in the current round of changeApplier work
2013-09-24T19:57:53 <Bosmon> A workaround for now is to wrap your listeners in a further function before registering them
2013-09-24T19:58:53 <Bosmon> FLUID-5155 seems peculiar - could you add some more detail on what you mean by "doesn\'t get resolved correctly"?
2013-09-24T19:59:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2013-09-24T19:59:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: sure, i will add more for 5155. in terms of 5151, what do you mean by "wrap your listeners in a further function before registering them"?
2013-09-24T20:00:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - if you simply supply a level of wrapping such as function () { listener.apply(null, arguments;}, then the framework will no longer believe the listener is the same :)
2013-09-24T20:01:01 <cindyli> ah, i see. thanks
2013-09-24T20:01:48 <Bosmon> Also, could you explain what you were doing when you encountered 5155?
2013-09-24T20:02:34 <cindyli> in video player, we need to pass in different UIO templates for html5 browsers or non-html5, so it has this chunk of code
2013-09-24T20:03:23 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/videoPlayer/blob/VP-297/demos/VideoPlayer.html#L84-L86
2013-09-24T20:03:42 <cindyli> one sec, let me push up the latest code
