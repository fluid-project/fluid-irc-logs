2013-12-18T20:00:12 <Justin_o> yzen: I'm having a strange issue and not sure if it's something you may have come across. Basically I have a component which contains checkboxes and radio buttons.. i select some of these, but then reset the ui which involves resetting the markup and destroying the component.. when the component is recreated though it is populated with the old selections..
2013-12-18T20:00:12 <Justin_o> even though the model is empty. Any ideas?
2013-12-18T20:01:06 <yzen> Justin_o: afaik there was an old bug where for checkboxes there should be defaults , not sure if it is still the issue and not sure if it relevant
2013-12-18T20:01:21 <yzen> other than that i don't think i ve seen anything strange about the checkboxes
2013-12-18T20:01:25 <Justin_o> what do you mean by defaults?
2013-12-18T20:01:31 <yzen> model values
2013-12-18T20:01:45 <Justin_o> ah okay.. well the component should have it's default value i guess..
2013-12-18T20:01:54 <Justin_o> well maybe not
2013-12-18T20:01:58 <Justin_o> it might be empty
2013-12-18T20:02:02 <yzen> hmm =
2013-12-18T20:06:07 <Justin_o> okay.. now it looks like the model isn't being reset properly.. although the persisted one is correct.. so on refresh it works.. :(
2013-12-18T20:06:35 <yzen> hmm

2013-12-18T20:32:34 <anastasiac> jhung, I've added some notes to http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Accessibility+Metadata+Automatic+Generation+by+Content+Type with questions/thoughts about things. Maybe we can figure out how to go over things. Will you be in the office again this week?
2013-12-18T20:33:55 <danaayotte> please count me in too anastasiac.  i should be in the office tomorrow.
2013-12-18T20:34:09 <jhung> anastasiac: I was planning on working from home rest of the week. Maybe we can chat tomorrow?
2013-12-18T20:34:48 <anastasiac> sounds good, jhung and danaayotte.

2013-12-18T14:41:11 <Justin_o> jhung, danaayotte: for the metadata demo, if the user adds a video and sets some metadata, but then goes back and changes the url.. should the metadata stay the same, or be reset?
2013-12-18T14:42:03 <danaayotte> the metadata should be reset Justin_o
2013-12-18T14:42:14 <danaayotte> do you agree jhung?

2013-12-18T15:49:14 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m almost done fixing the URL text field. What a pain! It seems like a lot of work in Bootstrap, but it makes me wonder how long it would have taken from scratch.
2013-12-18T15:49:35 <Justin_o> jhung: hmm.. that\'s a good question
2013-12-18T15:51:38 <jhung> The root problem was the inline-block elements bootstrap was applying to the inline-form styles. So by removing that I was able to reflow the width of the text field properly, but this also meant I needed to specify reflow behaviour using their grid system.
2013-12-18T16:02:47 <Justin_o> michelled: just so you know, i\'m fixing some issues with FLOE-125
2013-12-18T16:03:12 <michelled> ok, thx Justin_o
2013-12-18T16:33:19 <jhung> Justin_o: I just pushed up changes to FLOE-128. Can you take a look to make sure it looks okay?
2013-12-18T16:33:42 <Justin_o> jhung: sure.. just be a few minutes.. after standup okay?
2013-12-18T16:33:51 <jhung> sure Justin_o
2013-12-18T16:34:03 <anastasiac> jhung, I\'m having a look at this page on the wiki http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Accessibility+Metadata+Automatic+Generation+by+Content+Type and I\'m wondering if I might a) ask what \'default\' and \'recommended\' mean, and b) suggest some changes
2013-12-18T16:50:11 <jhung> anastasiac: sure. Want to chat over Skype or talking in the channel okay?
2013-12-18T16:51:24 <anastasiac> jhung, channel\'s ok. That way, I don\'t have to remember anything ;-)
2013-12-18T16:51:38 <jhung> :) Sure
2013-12-18T16:52:00 <anastasiac> plus I need to keep my fingers moving, they\'re stiffening up in the cold
2013-12-18T16:52:22 <jhung> That table may be a little dated anastasiac - it hasn\'t been updated in a while. give me a sec to see if there\'s anything that needs to get changed.
2013-12-18T16:53:53 <jhung> anastasiac: So it looks like the content is more or less unchanged. The difference between "default" and "recommended" is that "default" is what we automatically generate (i.e. it\'s our sensible default for that content type).
2013-12-18T16:54:18 <anastasiac> and "recommended"?
2013-12-18T16:54:30 <jhung> "Recommended" is what we would recommend the author to fill in using the editor. We don\'t generate any defaults for it since we don\'t know what values would go there.
2013-12-18T16:54:42 <anastasiac> ah, ok, that makes more sense
2013-12-18T16:55:01 <jhung> I\'ll change the wording for that to make it clear. :)
2013-12-18T16:55:15 <anastasiac> ok so regarding the last six columns on the right: motion simulation, flashing and sound
2013-12-18T16:55:27 <anastasiac> these refer to hazards in the resource
2013-12-18T16:55:42 <anastasiac> so I\'m not sure we should be filling any of them in by default
2013-12-18T16:55:52 <anastasiac> since we can\'t tell, and probably shouldn\'t assume
2013-12-18T16:55:55 <anastasiac> what do you think, jhung?
2013-12-18T16:57:30 * michelled has quit
2013-12-18T16:57:56 <jhung> anastasiac: for some we may know - if we\'re strictly speaking audio files, there will be no motion hazards.
2013-12-18T16:58:32 <anastasiac> ah, good point
2013-12-18T16:58:37 <jhung> but if it\'s video, then I would agree we can\'t assume there\'s motion hzard.
2013-12-18T16:58:47 <anastasiac> or sound hazard
2013-12-18T16:58:48 <jhung> It should be unknown.
2013-12-18T16:58:56 <jhung> yep.
2013-12-18T16:59:30 <anastasiac> so I recommend we change the text "sound" to "sound hazard" for clarity
2013-12-18T16:59:33 <anastasiac> in the column headers
2013-12-18T16:59:52 <jhung> Ok. I\'ll also add an unknown column for the hazards too.
2013-12-18T17:00:07 <anastasiac> jhung, probably no need; there\'s no metadata for "unknown"
2013-12-18T17:00:19 <anastasiac> "unknown" is conveyed by the lack of metadata
2013-12-18T17:01:04 <jhung> True. Then I will leave the hazard blank.
2013-12-18T17:08:14 <jhung> anastasiac: I updated the document. Let me know if there are any other edits.
2013-12-18T17:08:21 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung

2013-12-18T17:13:04 <Justin_o> jhung: looking at your FLOE-128 branch
2013-12-18T17:13:05 <Justin_o> did you merge in my changes?
2013-12-18T17:13:52 <jhung> Justin_o: I think so.
2013-12-18T17:13:55 <jhung> Let me check
2013-12-18T17:13:55 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. i\'ve merged with master so you may want to merge my change back into yours
2013-12-18T17:14:03 <jhung> ok.
2013-12-18T17:14:04 <Justin_o> jhung: also, did you want to indent the checkboxes in the audio panel
2013-12-18T17:14:07 <Justin_o> ?
2013-12-18T17:14:19 <Justin_o> it\'s a bit confusing with the radio buttons and checkboxes all in a row
2013-12-18T17:14:57 <jhung> Justin_o: they should be indented.
2013-12-18T17:15:22 <Justin_o> jhung: hmm.. not seeing it

2013-12-18T17:16:24 <jhung> Cache issue? Try a different browser perhaps Justin_o
2013-12-18T17:17:11 <Justin_o> jhung: okay. you\'re right
2013-12-18T17:18:04 <Justin_o> jhung: on iOS 3.5" screens the "OK" button pokes out of panel
2013-12-18T17:18:17 <Justin_o> and is cut off
2013-12-18T17:18:30 * jhung shakes fist at Bootstrap
2013-12-18T17:19:08 <Justin_o> jhung: same with 4" iOS screen
2013-12-18T17:19:36 <jhung> okay. I\'ll take a look at that Justin_o. otherwise is FLOE-128 looking okay?
2013-12-18T17:20:32 <Justin_o> jhung: iPad looks good
2013-12-18T17:20:41 <Justin_o> jhung: yes
2013-12-18T17:21:24 <Justin_o> jhung: well you might ant some padding on the caption url input fields on the right side when the metadata panels are below the edit panel
2013-12-18T17:22:08 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. How about we file new jiras for these so we can put FLOE-128 in?
2013-12-18T17:22:48 <Justin_o> jhung: in general i\'d agree but FLOE-115 has to go in first anyways..
2013-12-18T17:22:53 <Justin_o> so we probably have some more time
2013-12-18T17:23:38 <jhung> In terms of priority, should we fix the layout for iphone first then the URL field?
2013-12-18T17:23:45 <Justin_o> jhung: i think so
2013-12-18T17:24:00 <jhung> ok. I\'ll get started on that shortly Justin_o

2013-12-18T18:04:03 <anastasiac> jhung, your chart suggests we automatically generate the "X-on-visual" metadata for images that have X embedded. How were you thinking we\'d be able to automatically detect that?
2013-12-18T18:05:10 <anastasiac> I wonder if that should be "recommended" ?

2013-12-18T18:06:14 * scott_gonzalez has quit
2013-12-18T18:06:26 <jhung> There ways to know what they are based on the context in which the metadata is being generated anastasiac. i.e. if the author is creating content under Algebra in some OER, then we may be able to favour math related metadata.
2013-12-18T18:06:59 <jhung> Likewise, the user can choose what kind of image they are adding, so we may already know this information.
2013-12-18T18:07:06 <jhung> But you\'re right, there\'s no automatic way of knowing.
2013-12-18T18:08:05 * kasparnet has quit
2013-12-18T18:08:15 <jhung> I\'ll change it to be recommended since it largely depends on implementation.
2013-12-18T18:09:10 <anastasiac> interesting, jhun
2013-12-18T18:09:11 <anastasiac> jhung
2013-12-18T18:09:17 <anastasiac> I see your point
2013-12-18T18:09:45 <anastasiac> I wonder if the chart needs another category, "automatic in certain cases based on authoring environment" or something less wordy
2013-12-18T18:10:57 <anastasiac> hm
2013-12-18T18:11:17 <anastasiac> jhung: ^
2013-12-18T18:11:18 <jhung> anastasiac, if there was such a category, then I think all metadata can go under there since it\'s possible to know what metadata to populate if you ask the right questions ahead of time.
2013-12-18T18:11:22 * michelled joined the channel
2013-12-18T18:12:10 <anastasiac> true, but there\'s a difference between "if it\'s an image, we set \'visual\'" and "if it\'s an image, and if the authoring is editing math-based content and they\'ve used the button labelled "upload chart" then set "chart-on-image"
2013-12-18T18:12:30 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ve changed image: diagram / text / math / chart to have recommended text values, and added "has visual" for all of those.
2013-12-18T18:13:01 <jhung> anastasiac: exactly.
