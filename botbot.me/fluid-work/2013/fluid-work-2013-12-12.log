2013-12-12T20:23:02 <colinclark> lol
2013-12-12T20:23:17 <colinclark> I take off at 7:21 pm Central time
2013-12-12T20:23:34 <colinclark> if you can't get to it today, we can talk tomorrow, that's fine
2013-12-12T20:23:40 <colinclark> i have no lack of plane work
2013-12-12T20:23:45 <colinclark> and it's a short couple of flights
2013-12-12T20:24:00 <anastasiac> ok, I'll get you whatever I have this evening, but it might be a bit slim
2013-12-12T20:24:20 <anastasiac> and tomorrow morning, I'll be offline. I expect to be returning from my Mom's house
2013-12-12T20:24:45 <anastasiac> but I should be working tomorrow afternoon, colinclark
2013-12-12T20:25:03 <colinclark> ok
2013-12-12T20:25:05 <colinclark> me too

2013-12-12T15:31:03 <amilchev> I\'ve updated my pull request https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/10
2013-12-12T15:31:38 <amilchev> cindyli: whenever you have time, leave any comments
2013-12-12T15:31:50 <cindyli> cool. thanks, amilchev. sure, will do
2013-12-12T15:32:16 <amilchev> cindyli: I\'m about to change a few names perhaps, so if you notice any commits while commenting, pay little attention
2013-12-12T15:32:21 <amilchev> cindyli: thanks!
2013-12-12T15:32:31 <cindyli> got it. thanks, amilchev
2013-12-12T15:34:07 <cindyli> amilchev: hope your name changes include "gpii.primarySchema.moreless".
2013-12-12T15:34:32 <cindyli> this name would be problematic when more than one adjusters has more less feature.

2013-12-12T16:21:36 <colinclark> anastasiac: Hey, how\'s it going?
2013-12-12T16:21:53 <anastasiac> hey, colinclark, not too bad
2013-12-12T16:22:25 <colinclark> cool
2013-12-12T16:22:50 <colinclark> Did michelled mention to you that we\'ve got a short report due for Cloud4all regarding our metadata work?
2013-12-12T16:22:51 <anastasiac> snowy
2013-12-12T16:23:06 <colinclark> Yeah, it\'s snowy and cold here in Madison, too
2013-12-12T16:23:13 <anastasiac> she mentioned that you might be wanting some writing help related to metadata
2013-12-12T16:23:19 <colinclark> Ok, cool
2013-12-12T16:24:26 <colinclark> It was originally scheduled to be a prototype plus a short report
2013-12-12T16:24:39 <colinclark> As part of our yearly reporting, I\'ve noted that the prototype will be delayed
2013-12-12T16:24:59 <colinclark> So I think we can write the short report and provide links to our evolving metadata prototype
2013-12-12T16:25:28 <colinclark> I wonder if you have some thoughts on what kinds of things we\'d like to report on?
2013-12-12T16:25:44 <colinclark> I was thinking that it\'s worth providing a summary of the AccessForAll approach and history
2013-12-12T16:25:51 <colinclark> and then perhaps to cover the renewed activity in this world
2013-12-12T16:25:59 <colinclark> especially the schema.org effort
2013-12-12T16:26:14 <colinclark> Perhaps some examples of how such metadata will work
2013-12-12T16:26:16 <anastasiac> yes, I was going to say the schema.org effort, obviously
2013-12-12T16:26:42 <colinclark> Also a description of the sorts of things we think we can automatically generate
2013-12-12T16:26:42 <colinclark> and what things we think the user has to provide
2013-12-12T16:27:14 <anastasiac> yes, basically our plans for the tools we\'re going to create and our thinking behind it
2013-12-12T16:27:49 <colinclark> yes
2013-12-12T16:28:05 <colinclark> Do you have a few minutes today to whip up an outline of things you can think of to cover?
2013-12-12T16:28:14 <colinclark> And I\'ll add to it on the plane ride home tonight?
2013-12-12T16:28:54 <anastasiac> sure, I can put something together this afternoon. Is there a suggested length for this portion of the report, colinclark?
2013-12-12T16:29:09 * vjoanna has quit
2013-12-12T16:31:13 <colinclark> The DOW just says "the prototype will be accompanied by a very brief (a few pages) written description, indicating the basic functionalities and the possible current implementation limitations."
2013-12-12T16:31:58 <anastasiac> ok, "a few pages" That\'s a good enough guideline. Thanks for the text, that helps
2013-12-12T16:32:12 <colinclark> So it sounds like we can work with danaayotte and jhung to use this report as documentation of our design/development plans, too
2013-12-12T16:32:24 <colinclark> So I\'m thinking something like
2013-12-12T16:32:25 * vjoanna joined the channel
2013-12-12T16:32:27 <anastasiac> sounds good
2013-12-12T16:32:42 <colinclark> 1. The AccessForAll approach (philosophy and history)
2013-12-12T16:32:57 <colinclark> 2. Recent standardization activity
2013-12-12T16:33:08 <colinclark> 3. Automatic metadata generation (why and what we can do)
2013-12-12T16:33:36 <colinclark> 4. Limitations and the role of the user (refinement, easy-to-use metadata components)
2013-12-12T16:33:56 <colinclark> Where #4 is really an overview with wireframes of our prototype design effort
2013-12-12T16:34:00 <colinclark> something like that?
2013-12-12T16:34:13 <anastasiac> looks good
2013-12-12T16:34:36 <anastasiac> I can start with that and fill in the sections with some point forms to start, and you can review?
2013-12-12T16:35:10 <colinclark> that\'d be amazing
2013-12-12T16:35:13 <colinclark> you rule
2013-12-12T16:35:14 <anastasiac> and this is basically covering the work done this year, right, colinclark?
2013-12-12T16:35:29 <colinclark> this covers the whole effort
2013-12-12T16:35:48 <anastasiac> ah, work-to-date, you mean
2013-12-12T16:35:53 <anastasiac> ok, sounds good
2013-12-12T16:35:57 <colinclark> So your initial schema.org metadata draft and how it evolved into the larger community effort
2013-12-12T16:36:06 <colinclark> Our initial prototypes in OERC
2013-12-12T16:36:11 <colinclark> and now the next phase
2013-12-12T16:36:18 <anastasiac> ok
2013-12-12T16:36:26 <colinclark> yup, work to date
2013-12-12T16:37:47 <anastasiac> colinclark, what\'s the eventual deadline for this report?
2013-12-12T16:37:54 <colinclark> erm
2013-12-12T16:38:00 <colinclark> about two months ago
2013-12-12T16:38:01 <anastasiac> order of magnitude?
2013-12-12T16:38:03 <anastasiac> LOL
2013-12-12T16:38:08 <colinclark> How about next Friday?
2013-12-12T16:38:17 <colinclark> Finished, shipped, and off our minds by Friday
2013-12-12T16:38:17 <anastasiac> sounds good
2013-12-12T16:38:23 <colinclark> Friday Euro time
2013-12-12T16:38:37 <anastasiac> I\'ll be better able to focus next week than I have been this week
2013-12-12T16:38:48 <colinclark> sure
2013-12-12T16:38:50 <colinclark> no worries
2013-12-12T16:38:55 <colinclark> this travelling has been distracting for me, too
