2013-09-27T14:59:05 <anastasiac> cindyli, the gpii store looks pretty good. I\'ve tried creating a bunch of IDs and setting all different preferences. Seems to work just fine
2013-09-27T15:01:37 <cindyli> super! thanks, anastasiac, can you comment the test result on the pull request: https://github.com/fluid-project/prefsEditors/pull/49, so justin_o can carry on.

2013-09-27T15:14:19 * colinclark has quit
2013-09-27T15:15:13 <justin_o> cindyli: we should probably update infusion in the prefsEditors repo again, and then send another pull request to the gpii/prefsEditors
2013-09-27T15:15:32 <cindyli> good idea, justin_o
2013-09-27T15:15:59 <cindyli> justin_o: we should also talk about the multi language switching issue that Chris has
2013-09-27T15:22:35 <justin_o> cindyli: you mean the sort of on the fly language changes? currently it seems that it only happens on init.. i don\'t think we have a way to change the message bundles used on the fly.
2013-09-27T15:25:57 <cindyli> justin_o: i\'m thinking if we can have a way to re-run UIObuilder, which means re-instantiate UIO, at the language change, the dynamic change could be achieved.
2013-09-27T15:26:51 <justin_o> cindyli: they would need to pass in a different auxiliary schema though
2013-09-27T15:29:10 <cindyli> justin_o: Chris tries to pass a language variable into the aux schema, which sheds some lights on a possibility to alter path on the fly.
2013-09-27T15:30:13 <justin_o> cindyli: interesting
2013-09-27T15:31:31 * mrvisser has quit
2013-09-27T15:33:57 <justin_o> cindyli: did he modify the auxschema? or used the standard format?
2013-09-27T15:34:51 <cindyli> justin_o: he modified the aux schema a bit with string manipulation on the path to message files
2013-09-27T15:35:43 <justin_o> cindyli: ah i see
2013-09-27T15:36:01 <justin_o> cindyli: so he changes some global variable to try to get it to switch languages
2013-09-27T15:36:06 <cindyli> exactly
2013-09-27T15:36:41 <justin_o> cindyli: so perhaps what should be changing is the prefix
2013-09-27T15:37:07 <justin_o> or maybe we need to some other flag to consume different language paths
2013-09-27T15:37:46 <justin_o> cindyli: although this still doesn\'t feel quite right because we should be supporting this outside of the schema too
2013-09-27T15:37:50 * amilchev has left the channel
2013-09-27T15:52:34 <cindyli> justin_o: agree. passing a global var around certainly is not a clean way. but it gives some ideas of how much flexibility it needs for supporting multi language. Another thought is, create a wrapper component (or perhaps some other ways) to connect the constructed UIO with the language dropdown. so the language switch triggers an event telling the template loader to re-fetch from certain path.

2013-09-27T15:57:26 <justin_o> that\'s interesting.. but how do we get the languages in there.. do they have to be passed in to start? and somehow not pre-fetched?
2013-09-27T16:11:38 <cindyli> anastasiac: i finished updating http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/fluid.messageResolver, can you have a look when you have a chance?
2013-09-27T16:11:47 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli, will do

2013-09-27T16:40:31 * michelled_ joined the channel
2013-09-27T16:41:43 <anastasiac> cindyli, the messageResolver docs say "A message resolver is included automatically in any renderer-bearing components created using fluid.initRendererComponent." Do you know if it\'s also automatic if you use the fluid.rendererComponent grade?

2013-09-27T16:42:29 <cindyli> anastasiac: yes as i understood
2013-09-27T16:42:36 <anastasiac> ok, thanks cindyli
2013-09-27T16:42:40 <cindyli> np
2013-09-27T16:47:06 <anastasiac> cindyli, I see that the renderer component code that creates a message resolver is inside a condition that says "if (!rendererOptions.messageSource && that.options.strings) {\xe2\x80\xa6}" - would you agree that this means a messageResolver is not necessarily automatic?
2013-09-27T16:48:54 <anastasiac> I just want to make sure I\'m not missing something, or misunderstanding something
2013-09-27T16:50:49 <cindyli> anastasiac: my understanding is that once you attach a message resolver to "parentBundle" option of a renderer component, the message mapping will happen. this seems to me the message resolver functions are embedded in rendererComponent
2013-09-27T16:51:37 <cindyli> or the automation is triggered by "parentBundle" option
2013-09-27T16:51:47 <anastasiac> and if there\'s no parentBundle in the options?
2013-09-27T16:52:22 <cindyli> nothing to map to and "messageKey" on the protoTree would not be resolved
2013-09-27T16:53:13 <anastasiac> suppose the protoTree doesn\'t use messageKey anywhere? i.e. suppose the integrator makes no attempt at using string bundles?
2013-09-27T16:53:30 <cindyli> then they don\'t need to worry about attaching "parentBundle"
2013-09-27T16:53:42 <anastasiac> and no messageResolver would be created
2013-09-27T16:54:51 <cindyli> i\'m also looking at that chunk of code, trying to figure out what "rendererOptions.messageSource" is
2013-09-27T16:57:48 <cindyli> i think "if (!rendererOptions.messageSource && that.options.strings)" means if "strings" option is defined and message resolver hasn\'t been attached, create the message resolver
2013-09-27T16:58:08 <cindyli> so, the option that triggers the creation of the message resolver is the "strings" option
2013-09-27T16:58:16 <cindyli> this simplifies the logic
2013-09-27T16:58:38 <anastasiac> but it\'s checking rendererOptions.messageSource, not that.messageResolver
2013-09-27T16:59:04 <cindyli> the created resolver is attached onto rendererOptions.messageSource
2013-09-27T16:59:08 <cindyli> see line 188
2013-09-27T16:59:09 <anastasiac> if you look at lines 223-225, it\'s possible for there to be no messageResolver attached to that
2013-09-27T16:59:28 <anastasiac> line 188 is inside the if
