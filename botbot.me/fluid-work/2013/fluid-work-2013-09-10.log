b'2013-09-10T17:41:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: was looking at the stuff for amilchev this morning. He want\'s to basically add another template to pull in. The trick is how to get it in and how to use it.
2013-09-10T17:42:35 <cindyli> Justin_o: is amilchev using schema version of UIO?
2013-09-10T17:43:05 <cindyli> what\'s special with that "another template"? one panel with 2 templates?
2013-09-10T17:44:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. he\'s using the schema and yes.. seems like multiple templates for a single panel.. now sure what the renderer will do with this.. but assuming it works.. how would you get that other template in.. the easiest solution of course would be to have 1 template only, but i guess it would be nice to support multiple templates to make things more modular
2013-09-10T17:46:21 <cindyli> Justin_o: i don\'t think our current aux schema supports loading multiple templates for one single panel. we can extend to support that.
2013-09-10T17:46:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m thinking the integrator will have to pass it in to their generated UIO as another option to the templateLoader or we could fix the auxschema
2013-09-10T17:46:52 <cindyli> needs more thinking on how to support since each template needs to know which selector for it to render
2013-09-10T17:47:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: what do you mean
2013-09-10T17:47:54 <cindyli> let me find some panel code
2013-09-10T17:51:14 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, thanks
2013-09-10T17:51:58 <cindyli> here it is, Justin_o - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/StarterGrades.js#L244, right now, the panel container is enough since one panel only renders one template. If this panel takes in two templates, panel needs to be aware of where they are rendered. 2 css selectors I think
2013-09-10T17:52:37 * avtar joined the channel
2013-09-10T17:52:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m hoping that the renderer can just handle that, but don\'t know for sure..
2013-09-10T17:53:13 <Justin_o> i\'d have to ask Bosmon or run some tests
2013-09-10T17:53:36 <cindyli> agree
2013-09-10T17:53:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: but yes, if it doesn\'t that would be another big hurdle
2013-09-10T17:53:46 <cindyli> ya
2013-09-10T17:58:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: so any thoughts on how to get the templates in.. if we change the auxiliary schema i think we should take in a string for the simple case and an object for multiple templates
2013-09-10T17:58:57 <Justin_o> what do you think and how will this affect things internally
2013-09-10T17:58:58 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-10T18:05:08 <cindyli> Justin_o: I agree with the change you suggested for the aux schema. the part i\'m not sure about is whether renderer component support multiple template rendering, if it does, it should be easy to modify the aux builder. otherwise, we may need multiple panels or sub-panels for rendering multiple templates. let me take a look at the render component unit tests.
2013-09-10T18:05:59 <Justin_o> cindyli:  okay\xe2\x80\xa6 let me know if you see anything.. if not i\'ll try to make a quick test
2013-09-10T18:06:06 <Justin_o> or example
2013-09-10T18:06:14 <cindyli> sure
2013-09-10T18:16:43 <cindyli> Justin_o: don\'t see a unit test that renders multiple templates with one single renderer component
2013-09-10T18:16:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. i\'ll try to make a test for it.
2013-09-10T18:17:13 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Justin_o
2013-09-10T18:31:37 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli, Justin_o - can you explain what you mean by "multiple template rendering"?
2013-09-10T18:32:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great you are here.. if you have multiple templates in your resources block.. when the render is working will it look at all of them?
2013-09-10T18:33:58 * avtar has quit
2013-09-10T18:35:09 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-10T18:35:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - "not really" : P
2013-09-10T18:35:43 <Bosmon> But in particular, what do you want it to do with them?
2013-09-10T18:37:10 * mrvisser_ has quit
2013-09-10T18:37:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well now that i\'m thinking about it again.. i guess the renderer wouldn\'t really know where to put things, how to combine the templates. Anyways.. the issue is around the complex panels.. have you had any more thoughts about this? amilchev is trying to combine panels through grade merging.. to create a complex panel from several simple ones.. but he wanted to not have to create a new combined template.
2013-09-10T18:38:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so how would you like to describe this "combined template", without having to write it?
2013-09-10T18:42:08 * yzen joined the channel
2013-09-10T18:43:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s a good question since it will be hard to know how to assemble them..
2013-09-10T18:43:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what I suggest is, that you write a "template-rendering component"
2013-09-10T18:43:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have an idea of how we should be creating these types of complex panels?
2013-09-10T18:43:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what would that be?
2013-09-10T18:43:36 <Bosmon> Which accepts a "meta-template" with some empty divs in it, a bunch of selectors, and the component templates
2013-09-10T18:43:54 <Bosmon> It then uses the renderer to produce a set of "UIVerbatim" component in order to render the combined template
2013-09-10T18:44:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you mean a sort of template template
2013-09-10T18:44:20 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-09-10T18:44:22 <Justin_o> and we render a combined template
2013-09-10T18:44:31 <Justin_o> okay.. interesting idea..
2013-09-10T18:44:51 <Bosmon> This still leaves you with the problem of actually doing the rendering at the end, of course ....
2013-09-10T18:45:28 <Bosmon> Well, ironically, you don\'t really want a "combined template" since that\'s exactly what the renderer for the component panels can\'t accept
2013-09-10T18:46:29 <Bosmon> The way the current renderer is, you will need to do the rendering in two stages
2013-09-10T18:46:41 <Bosmon> But in general you won\'t be able to combine the panels through straightforward grade merging
2013-09-10T18:46:48 <Bosmon> YOu will need to create a special "grade-combining grade"
2013-09-10T18:47:07 <Bosmon> Since you will need to insert an extra lifecycle step to subvert the normal action of the renderewr
2013-09-10T18:48:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure if this causes more issues.. but the rendering is triggered by UIO as it expects the templates to be ready after the templateLoader
2013-09-10T18:48:20 <Justin_o> if i remember things correctly
2013-09-10T18:48:43 <Bosmon> Yes well, tinkering with the event boiling for that is the easy part of the problem
2013-09-10T18:49:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: uh oh.. what\'s the hard part
2013-09-10T18:50:27 <cindyli> the part to create a special "grade-combining grade", i guess

2013-09-10T18:51:14 <cindyli> it sounds pretty hard to me at least :)
2013-09-10T18:52:43 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: yes.. i still don\'t fully know what it entails
2013-09-10T18:53:11 <Justin_o> and how to subvert the normal action of the renderer
2013-09-10T18:55:16 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-09-10T18:59:04 <Bosmon> Well, it is only the "grade-combining grade" that will contain any unusual code
2013-09-10T18:59:24 <Bosmon> The subpanels themselves will be essentiall normal renderer components
2013-09-10T19:00:28 <cindyli> Justin_o, Bosmon: i\'m thinking this process is like what fluid.uiOptions is doing now. fluid.uiOptions is a view component that takes in one template which has a few empty divs for panels. its subcomponents are panel renderer components. what if we create this sort of generic component that replicates this structure and behavior\xe2\x80\xa6 what do you think?
2013-09-10T19:02:01 * clown has quit
2013-09-10T19:02:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2013-09-10T19:02:28 <Bosmon> With the one complication that if you indeed use this component itself for UIO, it will need to accept one like itself as children in addition to standard renderer components
2013-09-10T19:03:01 <Bosmon> This suggests that you will end up creating a new "parent grade" factored off from RendererComponent itself, once this work is completed fully
2013-09-10T19:03:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean using the rendererComponent as grade
2013-09-10T19:03:40 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-10T19:03:42 <cindyli> whoa. that sounds quite tricky
2013-09-10T19:04:32 <Bosmon> That bit can be left till last : P
2013-09-10T19:05:35 <Bosmon> Just "get it working" first : P
2013-09-10T19:05:48 <Bosmon> As colinclark will remark when he wakes up..... "ship it"!

2013-09-10T12:36:53 * jessm joined the channel

2013-09-10T12:39:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: to pick up from your last email - I successfully appended the small markup into the DOM but failed to instantiate the panel so that the change is applied - the selectors are still looked for BEFORE they have been appended
2013-09-10T12:40:51 <amilchev> Justin_o: I tried appending in the preInitFunction (instead of finalInit), but it didn\'t work at all. Am I supposed to do sth like this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/UIOptions.js#L403-L414 ?
2013-09-10T12:40:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: can you tell me a bit more about when you want the subcomponent to be instantiated, and how you are trying to do it
2013-09-10T12:42:11 <Justin_o> amilchev: we\'d probably rather do things more declaratively if possible. Some of the code hasn\'t been fully brought up to modern practices yet.
2013-09-10T12:43:03 <amilchev> Justin_o: um.. I didn\'t add the small panels as subcomponents, but as gradeNames
2013-09-10T12:44:43 <amilchev> Justin_o: what I want is the big panel to manage its selectors after the appending has finished
2013-09-10T12:45:14 <Justin_o> amilchev: are all of your changes in the divide-and-conquer branch?
2013-09-10T12:46:32 <amilchev> Justin_o: I haven\'t pushed them yet, but it\'s only slightly different from what is currently there - and I don\'t think this issue has anything to do with this difference
2013-09-10T12:46:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay
2013-09-10T12:47:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: sorry in case now is not a comfortable time, I don\'t mean to be disturbing
2013-09-10T12:47:39 <Justin_o> let me take another look.. so to be clear what you want is to manually append the template for keyEcho into the DOM and have the DOM binder work for the selectors pertaining to it.
2013-09-10T12:47:40 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-10T12:47:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: it\'s okay.. i have some time now
2013-09-10T12:48:00 <amilchev> yes
2013-09-10T12:49:31 <amilchev> https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/src/shared/adjusters/js/speakTextCollectivePanel.js#L145 this line works properly now, but I haven\'t pushed
2013-09-10T12:52:00 * sgithens has quit
2013-09-10T12:53:49 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'d guess the approach you\'d probably want to take is to add an event to fire after you append the template. Then you\'d bind a listener to this event and do your calls with the selectors here
2013-09-10T12:56:35 <amilchev> Justin_o: "do your calls with the selectors here" - I have nothing to do with these selectors manually, I just want them to be rendered (and shown of course)
2013-09-10T13:00:02 <Justin_o> amilchev: hmm.. okay.. not really sure what you need then.. i have the template being rendered fine for me, with the changes i mentioned to you yesterday.
2013-09-10T13:00:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: when do you use this template that.. which I guess is what the real issue is
2013-09-10T13:01:02 <amilchev> Justin_o: so you have the checkbox "Echo letter after typed" at the bottom ?
2013-09-10T13:02:25 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-09-10T13:03:07 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. it\'s in the markup.. it might be in the wrong place though as it is a sibling to <div class="preferences">
2013-09-10T13:04:23 <amilchev> Justin_o: oh yes, it is in the markup, but is it rendered as the other three checkboxes?
2013-09-10T13:05:04 <amilchev> Justin_o: when you run https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/demos/speakTextAdjusterGroup/index.html this file
2013-09-10T13:05:13 <amilchev> in node-webkit
2013-09-10T13:05:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: you mean like the one labelled "Uppercase Letters"
2013-09-10T13:06:17 <amilchev> yes
2013-09-10T13:08:54 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes and no.. it would have the same style if there was any text label. but there isn\'t so it\'s kind of hidden.. if i force text in there it looks the same. however it\'s not in the same container so the positioning is also different

2013-09-10T13:27:08 <Justin_o> amilchev: sorry it took a bit longer because i started over from your new code.. anyways.. not a whole lot of changes\xe2\x80\xa6 just added an event that i used to set the label of the checkbox with. https://github.com/jobara/prefsEditors/commit/c45b8fc5aceeaf950b444dfc6731efdae3da3352
2013-09-10T13:27:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: this is just a quick example.. it should probably be done differently depending on what you want to do exactly

2013-09-10T14:34:35 <amilchev> Justin_o: I got it shown now, too
2013-09-10T14:36:32 <amilchev> Justin_o: but I want it connected to the schema
2013-09-10T14:37:56 <amilchev> Justin_o: as it is related to keyEcho in the protoTreee - I want the switch to represent the state in the model and get the label from the appropriate messagekey
2013-09-10T14:38:44 <amilchev> Justin_o: sorry if I didn\'t make it clear before

2013-09-10T14:48:46 <amilchev> Justin_o: I have to go now, if you link the checkbox to the schema (otherwise it\'s useless), it\'d be great if you pushed your code again! Bye for now and thanks for the time.
