2013-09-09T20:41:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - why is the model missing?
2013-09-09T20:42:31 <cindyli> ah ha. which model?
2013-09-09T20:42:39 <cindyli> preview doesn\'t need a model
2013-09-09T20:43:03 <cindyli> its listener connects uio model and preview enhancer model
2013-09-09T20:49:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - I notice that the enactors are being destroyed on the refresh
2013-09-09T20:49:22 <Bosmon> And in fact they are being destroyed twice
2013-09-09T20:49:44 <cindyli> oh, how come
2013-09-09T20:50:02 <Bosmon> And there is something special about the textSize panel
2013-09-09T20:50:25 <Bosmon> Its enactor is only destroyed once
2013-09-09T20:51:09 <cindyli> are all preview enactors destroyed or only textSize enactor?
2013-09-09T20:52:06 <cindyli> this might be related: https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/blob/GPII-188/src/shared/lib/cloud4all/CustomAdjusters.js#L217-L219
2013-09-09T20:52:07 <Bosmon> It\'s a little hard to make out the sequence..... if only we had a VISUAL TOOL to help with these logs : P
2013-09-09T20:52:44 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2013-09-09T20:52:48 <Bosmon> Why is that block there?
2013-09-09T20:53:28 <cindyli> Chris doesn\'t want the textSize change being applied to magnifier preview window

2013-09-09T20:53:52 <Bosmon> sgithens
2013-09-09T20:54:01 <Bosmon> We were just mentioning our absence of VISUAL TOOLS : P
2013-09-09T20:55:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - where are the enhancers attached to the preview actually defined?
2013-09-09T20:55:43 <cindyli> here: https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/blob/GPII-188/src/shared/lib/cloud4all/CustomAdjusters.js#L213-L215
2013-09-09T20:55:54 <cindyli> same for textSize panel
2013-09-09T20:56:30 <cindyli> whatever enactors used by the outer main page enhancer are passed down to preview enhancer
2013-09-09T20:57:33 <Bosmon> ok, can you explain more about this comment? " onUIOptionsRefresh also triggers the preview enhancer model be updated, which is missing and causing the problem "
2013-09-09T20:57:57 <Bosmon> Do you mean "the problem" or "a problem"?
2013-09-09T20:59:16 <cindyli> i think "the problem", which is the problem that the preview textsize enactor stops working at the 2nd time
2013-09-09T20:59:25 <Bosmon> Ok, how does it cause that problem?

2013-09-09T21:01:07 <Bosmon> SGITHUENS!
2013-09-09T21:01:11 <Bosmon> We need some VIZZUAL TOOLS!
2013-09-09T21:01:13 <sgithens> visual tools are important
2013-09-09T21:01:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - can you explain your comment further?
2013-09-09T21:01:43 <cindyli> the line above is the listener gets triggered to update preview enhancer model at uiOptions modelChanged
2013-09-09T21:01:48 <Bosmon> What do you mean by the model being missing, and how does it relate to this line?
2013-09-09T21:01:50 <cindyli> it\'s not fired at the 2nd time
2013-09-09T21:01:53 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-09-09T21:02:09 <cindyli> sorry, the model is not missing, the listener firing is missing
2013-09-09T21:02:13 <Bosmon> ah ok

2013-09-09T21:12:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - it seeming that this is an issue caused by the bloody softNamespaces I invented :(
2013-09-09T21:13:04 <Bosmon> As far as I can see, all of the preview listeners are added with the same namespace
2013-09-09T21:13:13 <Bosmon> Which implies that only one of them ever can be active at the same time
2013-09-09T21:13:36 <cindyli> ah ha
2013-09-09T21:13:37 <Bosmon> They are all supplied the name "fluid.uiOptions.preview.updateModel" since they are all components of the same type
2013-09-09T21:14:08 <cindyli> good to know
2013-09-09T21:14:20 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s a simple accident of order of attachment which means that the first panel\'s listener is the active one the first time
2013-09-09T21:16:32 <cindyli> will you create a jira for it, Bosmon
2013-09-09T21:17:06 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-09-09T21:17:27 <cindyli> thanks for helping out, Bosmon. see you tomorrow
2013-09-09T21:17:29 <Bosmon> Well, now somehow I see that the listener is already gone by the time the 2nd listener comes to be registered :(
2013-09-09T21:17:35 <Bosmon> So there may well be something else going on
2013-09-09T21:17:46 <cindyli> umm..
2013-09-09T21:17:52 * kasparnet has quit
2013-09-09T21:18:03 <Bosmon> Although this may be something to do with the unnecessary extra destruction of the components
2013-09-09T21:18:14 <Bosmon> I think the base issue is probably as thought
2013-09-09T21:18:46 <cindyli> extra destruction? you mean enactors are destroyed twice?
2013-09-09T21:18:57 <Bosmon> Yes, I seemed to see two rounds of destruction in the logs
2013-09-09T21:19:07 <cindyli> i don\'t even know why they would be destroyed once
2013-09-09T21:19:18 <Bosmon> They are destroyed once because they are re-rendered
2013-09-09T21:19:23 <cindyli> ah ok
2013-09-09T21:19:27 <Bosmon> And everything attached to the preview components will be destroyed
2013-09-09T21:19:35 <cindyli> makes sense
2013-09-09T21:20:27 <cindyli> again, maybe this block is causing the 2nd destroy - https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/blob/GPII-188/src/shared/lib/cloud4all/CustomAdjusters.js#L217-L219
2013-09-09T21:20:47 <Bosmon> That should simply cause them never to be created
2013-09-09T21:20:59 <cindyli> that\'s right
2013-09-09T21:21:49 <Bosmon> So what I observe so far is that for some reason there is only ONE modelChanged listener attached to the root component
2013-09-09T21:22:05 <Bosmon> But there seem to be two separate causes for this ........
2013-09-09T21:22:18 <Bosmon> ah
2013-09-09T21:22:29 <Bosmon> I think both of them are sort of the same ... it is related to the namespaces
2013-09-09T21:24:34 <cindyli> ok. at least we have somewhere to start. thanks, Bosmon
2013-09-09T21:26:06 * cindyli has quit
2013-09-09T21:26:22 <Bosmon> o horrible
2013-09-09T21:26:24 <Bosmon> I see it now, yes
2013-09-09T21:26:31 <Bosmon> The components are destroyed in order
2013-09-09T21:26:42 <Bosmon> And as each next one instantiates, it removes the listener supplied by the previous one

2013-09-09T20:06:03 <Bosmon2> Hi there cindyli
2013-09-09T20:06:06 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2013-09-09T20:12:43 <cindyli> Bosmon: not sure if you read about the problem that Chris have after having "distribute options" to pass down a type of empty component to a preview enactor. justin and I were tracing down the issue this morning and there\'s something weird that we don\'t figure out. so need your help.
2013-09-09T20:15:09 <cindyli> the problem is that after panel refreshView, where preview components are refreshed as well, the model linkage between uiOptions and preview components are broken
2013-09-09T20:16:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - I see
2013-09-09T20:16:15 <Bosmon> Tne empty component type should certainly be send down a 2nd time ....
2013-09-09T20:16:22 <cindyli> yes, it did
2013-09-09T20:16:27 <cindyli> that\'s confirmed
2013-09-09T20:16:28 <Bosmon> aha
2013-09-09T20:16:49 <cindyli> the panel component that has a preview subcomponent: https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/blob/GPII-188/src/shared/lib/cloud4all/CustomAdjusters.js#L24-L33
2013-09-09T20:17:34 <Bosmon> btw this file contains quite a number of tabs ....

2013-09-09T20:19:27 <cindyli> ok, will let Chris know to clean it up
2013-09-09T20:19:54 <cindyli> after panel and preview are refreshed, this listener no longer works: https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/UIOptions.js#L471
2013-09-09T20:20:29 <cindyli> event though it\'s attached onto the preview component at the 2nd time
2013-09-09T20:21:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - the listener is still attached?
2013-09-09T20:21:09 <cindyli> yes
2013-09-09T20:21:09 <Bosmon> So what part of it doesn\'t work?
2013-09-09T20:21:34 <cindyli> it\'s no longer triggered at uiOptions modelChanged
2013-09-09T20:22:35 <Bosmon> No longer triggered ...

2013-09-09T20:23:06 <Bosmon> Did you try making a test case?
2013-09-09T20:24:47 <cindyli> not yet, with all these rendering and model connections, what a headache when I think about it. :)
2013-09-09T20:25:23 <Bosmon> ok, what can I do to reproduce the issue
2013-09-09T20:26:43 <cindyli> pull down my branch, open up http://localhost/prefsEditors/demos/pmt/index.html
2013-09-09T20:26:55 <cindyli> adjust localhost to your local url
2013-09-09T20:27:29 <cindyli> 1. click "increase size" to open up the dropdown menu
2013-09-09T20:27:50 <cindyli> 2. adjust the first panel "text size", the preview works fine
2013-09-09T20:27:59 <cindyli> 3. click "save and apply"
2013-09-09T20:28:36 <cindyli> 4. adjust the first panel "text size" again \xe2\x80\x94 the preview stops working
2013-09-09T20:31:26 <cindyli> if you comment line 27417 @ src/shared/lib/infusion/MyInfusion.js, the preview at the 2nd time will be back working
2013-09-09T20:31:39 <cindyli> that line is - that.events.onUIOptionsRefresh.fire();
2013-09-09T20:33:11 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-09T20:33:54 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, I can reproduce it
2013-09-09T20:33:56 <cindyli> onUIOptionsRefresh event triggers all the panels to refresh - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/StarterGrades.js#L219
2013-09-09T20:34:00 <cindyli> cool
