b'2013-11-21T19:45:52 <Bosmon> cool
2013-11-21T19:45:58 <Bosmon> How many duplicates are you down to now :)
2013-11-21T19:46:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the components do still need to be created twice to 1) get the produce tree 2) recreate after rendering to re-establish any dom bindings
2013-11-21T19:46:26 <Justin_o> just the 2 that we could see
2013-11-21T19:47:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, i\'ve fixed this in my FLUID-5205 branch
2013-11-21T19:48:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks
2013-11-21T19:49:06 <Bosmon> If the performance is still poor, it may be worth making a new lifecycle for the components whereby their DOM binder can be recreated
2013-11-21T19:49:23 <Bosmon> Since a 100% speedup still shouldn\'t be sneezeed at
2013-11-21T19:50:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting... what would happen to this-ist invokers those
2013-11-21T19:50:23 <Bosmon> Those could be turned into "slow invokers"
2013-11-21T19:50:27 <Bosmon> That is, with dynamic: true
2013-11-21T19:50:35 <Bosmon> Shifting some of the cost from render time to runtime
2013-11-21T19:50:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. what about this-ist listeners that do things onCreate?
2013-11-21T19:51:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - those could be moved to listen to a new event, say "onDomBind"
2013-11-21T19:51:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess the thing i\'d be worried about is that these panels should be usable in and out of a composite panel
2013-11-21T19:52:01 <Justin_o> so as a top level or subpanel
2013-11-21T19:52:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-11-21T19:52:23 <Bosmon> This could be mediated by a suitable "mixin grade"
2013-11-21T19:52:43 <Bosmon> By default, there would be a single listener to onCreate which just fires onDomBind
2013-11-21T19:52:54 <Bosmon> And when they are in the context of the composite panel, this listener would be removed
2013-11-21T19:53:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting
2013-11-21T19:54:04 <Justin_o> that might work.. it is a bit of an extra burden on the implementor to keep these things all straight
2013-11-21T19:54:14 <Bosmon> Well, it should be no burden on them
2013-11-21T19:54:22 <Bosmon> Just on the poor sap who wrote the aux builder :)
2013-11-21T19:54:48 <Justin_o> haha
2013-11-21T19:55:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but i mean the implementor would have to write the listener against onDomBind instead of onCreate
2013-11-21T19:55:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-11-21T19:55:31 <Bosmon> But they would be instructed to do this
2013-11-21T19:55:34 <Bosmon> By our documentation :)
2013-11-21T19:56:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right, but it would be added cognitive burden for them.. although the performance improvement may be worth it
2013-11-21T19:56:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you have an opinion on this?
2013-11-21T19:56:21 <Bosmon> I don\'t think it would be much extra burden... in fact it might well simplify things
2013-11-21T19:56:27 <Bosmon> We register far too many things on "onCreate"
2013-11-21T19:56:31 <anastasiac> Justin_o, how far back should I start reading?
2013-11-21T19:56:36 <Bosmon> And this lifecycle point will be an important one in the "new renderer"
2013-11-21T19:56:41 <Bosmon> So we had better start getting used to it :)
2013-11-21T19:56:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: from about 2:41
2013-11-21T19:57:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh so it will be a real thing..
2013-11-21T19:57:54 <Bosmon> We\'re certainly not going to have renderer components in the new world that are obliged to destroy and recreate themselves when they render something : P
2013-11-21T19:58:11 <Justin_o> :)
2013-11-21T19:58:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thankfully
2013-11-21T19:58:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'m going to file this under a new jira though.. i don\'t think it should hold up FLUID-5205
2013-11-21T19:58:41 <Bosmon> ok
2013-11-21T19:58:42 <Justin_o> does that make sense to you?
2013-11-21T19:58:47 <Bosmon> How is the performance now?
2013-11-21T19:58:53 <anastasiac> it sounds from the discussion that this onDomBind will be a formal framework lifecycle point, and I don\'t think it would be too unreasonable to expect developers to learn the difference between it and onCreate, and to understand when to use one or the other
2013-11-21T19:59:11 <anastasiac> if I\'m understanding correctly
2013-11-21T19:59:18 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think for the moment though it will only apply to panels
2013-11-21T19:59:26 <Bosmon> Very few things will go on "onCreate" in the future
2013-11-21T19:59:31 <anastasiac> ok, so part of the prefs framework
2013-11-21T19:59:53 <anastasiac> but still, it seems ok to me, from the integrator/documentation perspective
2013-11-21T20:00:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2013-11-21T20:01:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i would say definitely feels like less than a second if FF with firebug open.. i can put things back and get you some real numbers if you like
2013-11-21T20:01:43 <Bosmon> "definitely less than a second" is still far from great : P
2013-11-21T20:01:49 <Bosmon> Although firebug does make a huge difference
2013-11-21T20:02:16 <anastasiac> FYI, Justin_o and Bosmon, I have a FLUID-5205 branch now that has the conditional adjuster instructional demos in place more formally. It\'s not quite ready for a pull request - there are some styling issues - but it\'s close, in case you want to merge it in for testing, Justin_o
2013-11-21T20:02:47 <anastasiac> Justin_o, it\'s based on your latest FLUID-5205 branch
2013-11-21T20:03:01 <Justin_o> anastasiac: did you just do an update, because i just made a change
2013-11-21T20:03:24 <anastasiac> ok, no, not that recently :-)
2013-11-21T20:03:27 <anastasiac> in progress
2013-11-21T20:03:30 <Justin_o> thanks
2013-11-21T20:04:18 <anastasiac> ok, Justin_o, merged and pushed
2013-11-21T20:05:11 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2013-11-21T20:05:17 <Justin_o> i guess i should merge yours into mine
2013-11-21T20:05:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so before it took 1.841s  now it takes 0.699s
2013-11-21T20:06:24 <Bosmon> Not as much of an improvement as expected
2013-11-21T20:06:39 <Justin_o> :(
2013-11-21T20:07:05 <Bosmon> But implementing "onDOMBind" should definitely get it below 0.5s at least
2013-11-21T20:07:12 <Bosmon> Which is probably an important barrier
2013-11-21T20:07:58 <Bosmon> You can do that in a new branch as you say
2013-11-21T20:08:16 <Bosmon> Once we get anastasiac\'s stuff merged into this current one we should be good to go
2013-11-21T20:08:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. i\'ll file a new jira for that
2013-11-21T20:08:34 <Bosmon> Btw anastasiac - when you prepare your branch, could you also prepare a page describing "acceptance tests"?
2013-11-21T20:08:46 <Bosmon> That is, for each one of your instructional demos, what the user should expect to see when they operate the component
2013-11-21T20:09:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: anastasiac\'s code is merged into my FLUID-5205 branch.. it should be up in the pull request now
2013-11-21T20:09:30 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I can add that in a readme in the folder - is that what you\'re thinking of? Or perhaps in the HTML page of the demo, so that when they run it they see it?
2013-11-21T20:10:07 <Bosmon> In the demo page would be even better, yes
2013-11-21T20:10:24 <Bosmon> It would be useful to the "instructees" to know what they should expect the component to do
2013-11-21T20:10:28 <Bosmon> Just as to "testers"
2013-11-21T20:11:20 <anastasiac> will do
2013-11-21T20:11:35 <Bosmon> thanks, anastasiac!
2013-11-21T20:11:56 <anastasiac> FYI, Bosmon and Justin_o, the instructional demos that are now in Justin_o\'s 5205 branch aren\'t styled very well, I\'m still working on that
2013-11-21T20:21:13 <cindyli> Bosmon: wonder if you have time to look at one of my another pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/438
2013-11-21T20:35:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: filed a new jira for the performance upgrades http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5220

2013-11-21T14:53:18 <Justin_o> anastasiac: and there are 6 incoming links to the demand resolution page still
2013-11-21T14:53:40 <anastasiac> Justin_o, that's probably a question for Bosmon. I had actually removed it, but he restored it. And if we remove it, we should clean up the incoming links first.

2013-11-21T16:06:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - have you tried running it in one or other of the profilers?
2013-11-21T16:07:14 <Bosmon> It's most likely you'll discover that the cost is actually lying in some unnecessary DOM manipulations, even with our slow framework, manipulating and instantiating those component trees shouldn't take much time
2013-11-21T16:07:39 <Bosmon> Especially given you discovered all those redundant ChangeAppliers, you'll most likely discover a storm of unnecessary model change events
2013-11-21T16:11:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: haven't tried that yet.. i can take a look now.. i was going to look at cindy's latest pull request.. unless you'd prefer to do that..
2013-11-21T16:17:26 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I'm restructuring the instructional demo code for the conditional panels, and I'm rediscovering an issue with the template prefix
2013-11-21T16:18:12 <anastasiac> the template prefix is used for the templates I'm using in my panel, but the same prefix is also used to seek out the SepratedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.html; I'd rather just use the one that comes with the framework, but the same prefix location is used for both
2013-11-21T16:19:09 <anastasiac> the only way to tell the prefsEditor to use the framework version is with a blechy option to iframeRenderer
2013-11-21T16:20:12 <anastasiac> otherwise, I have to copy it into my templates folder and rewrite the paths in its headers
2013-11-21T16:22:44 * colinclark has quit
2013-11-21T16:24:05 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you know if there's any other way to tell the prefsEditor to just use the framework's iframe template? or maybe cindyli knows? was anything put in for this?
2013-11-21T16:24:20 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i'd defer to cindyli but i don't know of way
2013-11-21T16:26:14 <cindyli> anastasiac: r u using aux schema for this?
2013-11-21T16:26:20 <anastasiac> yes, cindyli
2013-11-21T16:26:56 <cindyli> if one path is exceptional than others, you can specify the full path for that template url, anastasiac
2013-11-21T16:27:23 <cindyli> without using %prefix
2013-11-21T16:27:41 <anastasiac> yes, but the exceptional path is the one for the iframe template, cindyli; can I specify that in the schema? it's in the markupProps option to the iframerenderer...

2013-11-21T16:28:57 <cindyli> which part is the iframe for? preview? anastasiac
2013-11-21T16:28:58 <Justin_o> if so you might be able to use the @ references

2013-11-21T18:46:54 <anastasiac> cindyli, I see that FLUID-5190 has been fixed and merged (the textfieldSlider 'value' model path issue). Does this mean I can now use whatever model path I want for my sliders? Is there anything in particular I need to know?
2013-11-21T18:58:41 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac
2013-11-21T18:59:00 <cindyli> the new textfield slider makes use of model relay, let me find u an example
2013-11-21T18:59:44 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L479-L490
2013-11-21T19:01:52 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli
2013-11-21T19:02:00 <cindyli> anastasiac: Justin_o recently found an timing issue with having textfieldSlider rendered as a decorator on the protoTree when the panel is a subpanel of a composite panel. the safer way is to make textfieldSlider a subcomponent
2013-11-21T19:02:22 <anastasiac> right: no decorators in composite panels
2013-11-21T19:02:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes.. decorators are not allowed :)
2013-11-21T19:02:29 <cindyli> anastasiac: example again - https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/blob/GPII-153_GPII-187/src/shared/adjusters/js/speakTextPanels.js#L32-L69
2013-11-21T19:02:31 <anastasiac> hm
2013-11-21T19:02:34 <anastasiac> but it works for me
2013-11-21T19:02:48 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it can work, but if you need to share things from the parent like an applier it won't
2013-11-21T19:03:36 <anastasiac> what would the use case for having to share the applier from the parent, Justin_o?
2013-11-21T19:04:16 <cindyli> anastasiac: to pass down sourceApplier for model relay
2013-11-21T19:04:35 <anastasiac> but when would I need to do that? I'm not doing it now, and everything works fine...
2013-11-21T19:05:09 <cindyli> anastasiac: depends on ur use case i think.
2013-11-21T19:05:45 <anastasiac> hm. well, I'd love to understand a use case that would require me to pass down the sourceApplier
2013-11-21T19:06:16 <cindyli> well, anastasiac, the 2nd example is the use case you need: https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/blob/GPII-153_GPII-187/src/shared/adjusters/js/speakTextPanels.js#L32-L69

2013-11-21T19:45:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: michelled  and i found the main culprit.. i had been calling the creation event too many times because it was accidentally placed inside of a loop instead of out.
