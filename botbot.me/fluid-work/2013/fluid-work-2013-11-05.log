2013-11-05T14:28:10 <chrispetsos> so Justin_o did you get anywhere with the problem i\'ve described yesterday?
2013-11-05T14:28:50 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: not really.. can you send me the link to the example that doesn\'t work again
2013-11-05T14:29:07 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: basically i was delayed in trying it out, and it was offline when i did..
2013-11-05T14:29:25 <Justin_o> i think you were saying there was an issue with the repeatingSelectors somehow
2013-11-05T14:30:26 <chrispetsos> yes, here it is http://160.40.60.238/prefsEditors/demos/adjustersPilots2/
2013-11-05T14:30:37 <chrispetsos> it is checked out at the problematic version
2013-11-05T14:30:53 * anastasiac joined the channel
2013-11-05T14:31:19 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: thanks.. what should i be seeing as the issue?
2013-11-05T14:33:05 <chrispetsos> so, click "Mouse cursor" for " Magnifier location follows: " and  "Text cursor" for "Screen reader follows:" click "Save and Apply" -> "Mouse cursor" for  "Screen reader follows:" is ticked
2013-11-05T14:33:32 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: can you confirm this?
2013-11-05T14:34:11 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. i see that..
2013-11-05T14:34:15 <Justin_o> interesting
2013-11-05T14:36:10 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: so the solution to that was to define selectors, repetaingSelector and protoTree in the sub-adjuster e.g. https://github.com/chrispetsos/prefsEditors/blob/adjusters-pilots-2/src/shared/adjusters/js/MagnifierFollowsFollowingElementAdjuster.js
2013-11-05T14:40:02 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: him... did you have to do both of those things to get it to work?
2013-11-05T14:41:26 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: yes, there seems to be a dependency on the selectors names and values used as *ID in the protoTree expander so this went inherently
2013-11-05T14:41:54 <Justin_o> yes.. the protoTree is keyed off of the selectors..
2013-11-05T14:42:06 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: are you using the same template for both?
2013-11-05T14:42:17 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: Yes
2013-11-05T14:42:35 <Justin_o> it could be related to DOM ID\'s then
2013-11-05T14:42:53 <Justin_o> i suppose now you are using different templates since the selectors are different
2013-11-05T14:44:21 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: it\'s pretty strange that it only happens when you select something from both groups
2013-11-05T14:44:55 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: actually no, i am using the same template, the selector names are different, selectors  values are the same
2013-11-05T14:45:05 <chrispetsos> looks akward but it works
2013-11-05T14:46:10 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: so if you use the same selector names it breaks still
2013-11-05T14:46:14 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: the first "Mouse cursor" label has ID "followingElementRow::followingElementLabel" while the second has "followingElementRow::followingElementLabel-1", there seems to be some kind of distinction
2013-11-05T14:47:03 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: haven\'t tried that, but having the selecotrs in the base grade breaks it yes
2013-11-05T14:47:57 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: i\'m still somewhat surprised that it has this error.. which revision is this from.. i\'m going to do a checkout of it, so that i can try to play around with it some more..
2013-11-05T14:48:37 <chrispetsos> this is it https://github.com/chrispetsos/prefsEditors/commits/5eda943f1e91055f4ee6fa4e8549d32327b22a43
2013-11-05T14:53:45 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: thanks.. let me see.. i guess for now keep going with what you\'re doing.. i\'m not sure if there is something amiss in your code or if you\'ve stumbled upon a bug..
2013-11-05T14:53:54 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: i\'ll let you know what i find though
2013-11-05T14:54:34 <chrispetsos> Justin_o, OK thanks, do you want to leave that link live during the day? it\'s my dev machine
2013-11-05T14:54:52 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: it\'s okay.. now that i know what revision to use i can run it locally
2013-11-05T14:55:05 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: how much longer will you be around today?
2013-11-05T14:55:46 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: OK great, i\'ll be leaving in a quarter, so mail me if you have any update ok?
2013-11-05T14:56:09 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: sure, will do

2013-11-05T16:53:59 <Justin_o> jhung: will you and johnny have time to look into a yaml implementation before next weeks community meeting?
2013-11-05T16:54:50 <jhung> Should be able to Justin_o.
2013-11-05T16:55:04 <jhung> Would be good to try their accessibility features
2013-11-05T16:55:14 <Justin_o> jhung: yes.. that would be interesting
2013-11-05T16:55:37 <Justin_o> jhung: so from your standup update, it sounds like theming in bootstrap will just be though less
2013-11-05T16:56:01 <Justin_o> danaayotte: scheduled the first informal design review community meeting http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops
2013-11-05T16:57:21 <danaayotte> thanks Justin_o
2013-11-05T16:57:43 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. Theming is basic in bootstrap.
2013-11-05T16:59:31 <Justin_o> jhung okay
2013-11-05T17:16:33 <colinclark> yzen: Wow, take a look at the result of a year\'s worth of work: https://github.com/marcelbdigital/SecurityGateway/tree/master/6.%20SourceCode
2013-11-05T17:22:11 <anastasiac> danaayotte and Justin_o, remember the community workshop docs sprints are mostly filling in spaces, so if you want to schedule the first design review earlier, we could easily swap with a docs sprint
2013-11-05T17:22:21 <yzen> impressive, colinclark
2013-11-05T17:23:06 <colinclark> yzen: I guess this is what most people think declarative programming is like: https://github.com/marcelbdigital/SecurityGateway/blob/master/6.%20SourceCode/Proxy%20Server/Cloud4allPorxy.txt
2013-11-05T17:23:14 <yzen> ya
2013-11-05T17:23:30 <colinclark> Yes please, I totally want low-level control statements in XML!
2013-11-05T17:23:45 <colinclark> REBUTJADA!!!!
2013-11-05T17:24:01 <yzen> :)
2013-11-05T17:26:27 <danaayotte> thanks anastasiac, we were thinking about timing relative to a11y camp.  to give people more than a few days notice.  and also a date that would work going forward.  hopefully first wed. of the month will be easy to remember
2013-11-05T17:26:38 <anastasiac> sounds good
