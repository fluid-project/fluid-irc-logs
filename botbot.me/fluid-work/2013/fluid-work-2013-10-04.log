b'2013-10-04T19:12:46 <Justin_o> it contains the resources needed to do the !important injection into the css files used by UIO
2013-10-04T19:13:38 <anastasiac> Justin_o, if these files are related to what we\'re now calling the prefs framework, how about "prefsFramework" ?
2013-10-04T19:14:02 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. thanks
2013-10-04T19:15:47 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-04T19:19:45 <Justin_o> cindyli: maybe we can leave the references in the release notes, those are all for 1.4 anyways.. so we will be re-writing them for 1.5
2013-10-04T19:19:57 <Justin_o> and technically they are still correct for 1.4
2013-10-04T19:20:02 <cindyli> sounds good, Justin_o
2013-10-04T19:22:46 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac, Bosmon: should the uiOptions component be created using the schema or grades.. or should we have instances for both?

2013-10-04T19:23:58 <clown> jhernandez are you still around?
2013-10-04T19:24:07 <anastasiac> good question, Justin_o. Given that our goal with the component is to provide an option that requires no modification, it shouldn\'t matter. But if modification i.e. customization is going to happen, does the choice affect how the customization would/could be done?
2013-10-04T19:24:23 <anastasiac> e.g. if the grades are used, could I tweak it with a schema option? and vice-versa?
2013-10-04T19:24:33 <Justin_o> anastasiac: unfortunately they are quite different as it stands
2013-10-04T19:24:58 <Justin_o> since the schema version will create the enhancer and settings store as well
2013-10-04T19:25:09 <anastasiac> so if we implement using schemas, customization must be done with schemas, and if we implement with grades, customization must be done with grades?
2013-10-04T19:25:17 <anastasiac> wait, the grades version won\'t create enhancer and store??
2013-10-04T19:25:55 * colinclark has quit
2013-10-04T19:25:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: correct.. there are separate initializations for those when you use grades
2013-10-04T19:26:16 <Justin_o> and no you couldn\'t adjust customizations of the grades with a schema
2013-10-04T19:26:32 <Justin_o> you could go the other way though...
2013-10-04T19:26:50 <Justin_o> anastasiac: this is because there is a separate tool, the builder, that creates the uio from the schema
2013-10-04T19:27:08 <anastasiac> I wonder if a grades version of a uiOptions component *should* create the enhancer and store...
2013-10-04T19:27:51 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it\'s a good question.. i guess it depends on what uiOptions is now..
2013-10-04T19:27:52 <anastasiac> given that you can go the other way, plus the enhancer/store issue, perhaps the uiOptions component should just use the schemas
2013-10-04T19:27:55 <Justin_o> is it the full stack
2013-10-04T19:28:02 <Justin_o> and not just the editor interface like it was before
2013-10-04T19:28:06 <anastasiac> that way, integrators can tweak the schemas, or use grades to customize
2013-10-04T19:29:20 <Justin_o> right.. so i guess i could move the grades stuff to a new manual test and we\'d be back down to a single uiOptions demo
2013-10-04T19:30:07 <anastasiac> I guess so, yes. I wonder what cindyli, Bosmon think? maybe michelled?
2013-10-04T19:32:30 <Justin_o> i guess the other issue with the schema version though is there is this component that creates the actual component so it would be strange to try to pass in options and etc. if you are expecting things to be initialized for your right away. meaning are you passing in options to the builder or to the running instance of UIO
2013-10-04T19:32:41 <michelled> I\'d like that better. I don\'t like the two UIO demos - I think it will be confusing for people looking at the demos
2013-10-04T19:34:04 <Justin_o> michelled: i\'m wondering if UIO is the stack of prefEditor, store, and enhancer
2013-10-04T19:34:13 <Justin_o> michelled:  and then the builder would create one of these stacks
2013-10-04T19:34:24 <Justin_o> anastasiac, Bosmon, cindyli: ^ what do you think
2013-10-04T19:36:46 <anastasiac> I like the idea of our "UIO component" being a bit of a demonstration of what the prefs framework can do, so including the full stack (editor + enhancer + store) makes sense to me
2013-10-04T19:37:29 <anastasiac> but I\'d describe it as "the builder creates a stack" and UIO is a packaged use of the builder to provide the stack with a simpler interface

2013-10-04T20:11:30 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: i was talking in person with michelled and anastasiac. since it is so simple to create a basic UIO with the builder.. we are just going to drop the component entirely and just have the demo instead.

2013-10-04T14:24:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: long but i guess so

2013-10-04T14:24:39 <Justin_o> html
2013-10-04T14:25:07 <cindyli> sounds good. thanks
2013-10-04T14:25:10 <anastasiac> I don\'t mind the long name, myself
2013-10-04T14:25:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you know what this means? http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-3740
2013-10-04T14:25:27 <anastasiac> SeparatedPanel might be confused w Panels in general
2013-10-04T14:25:37 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s true
2013-10-04T14:26:14 <anastasiac> Justni_o, that issue sounds like it was completed long ago
2013-10-04T14:26:33 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks.. i\'ll close it
2013-10-04T14:26:36 <anastasiac> I vote for the longer name, cindyli and Justin_o, to avoid confusion with prefs panels
2013-10-04T14:27:16 <anastasiac> Justin_o, if you look at that issue\'s parent issue, you might find some other things we can close :-)
2013-10-04T14:27:36 <anastasiac> i.e. all of them!!
2013-10-04T14:28:23 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, i\'m fine with the longer name, my only concern is it could be even longer in the case at renaming FatPanelUIOptionsFrame.html -> SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.html
2013-10-04T14:29:29 <anastasiac> well, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...

2013-10-04T14:34:37 <anastasiac> my vote is: go with the longer names, cindyli. Maybe we can get another vote from michelled when she gets in

2013-10-04T16:46:26 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - how are you getting on with the "args" improvement to the testing framework?
2013-10-04T16:50:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: we should probably opportunistically get to as many of these issues as possible while we do the renaming http://issues.fluidproject.org/issues/?jql=component%20%3D%20%22Prefs%20Framework%22%20AND%20project%20%3D%20FLUID%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC
2013-10-04T16:51:19 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o, let\'s try
2013-10-04T16:51:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. i\'m not sure how many there will be
2013-10-04T16:51:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you see the questions i left in the channel for you on wednesday?
2013-10-04T16:52:10 <cindyli> Bosmon: i haven\'t started on that yet. but I noticed IoC testing framework probably already provides a way to accomplish that by using eventMaker and makeArgs
2013-10-04T16:52:33 <cindyli> rather than directly attaching thru "listener"
2013-10-04T16:52:43 <cindyli> sorry, not "eventMaker", should be "listenerMaker"
2013-10-04T16:53:37 <cindyli> if that works, all we need to do is to add another test case into TestingTest.js

2013-10-04T18:16:08 <cindyli> Justin_o: all paths have already been updated and pushed up into my github branch
2013-10-04T18:17:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: really.. that was fast.. okay.. i\'ll update and test your changes out.. it\'s also occured to me that we might need to do some splitting out from within files.. like moving css and etc.
2013-10-04T18:17:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m not sure if any such case exists but we will probably need to reivew things

2013-10-04T18:49:37 <Bosmon> cindyli, Justin_o - I think you can eliminated the term "Panel" from the long name you quoted earlier
2013-10-04T18:49:42 <Bosmon> eliminate
2013-10-04T18:51:22 <cindyli> i\'m ok with that. what do other ppl think? anastasiac, michelled: ^
2013-10-04T18:52:49 <michelled> can you say the long name please cindyli?
2013-10-04T18:53:02 <cindyli> now i have another long name: prefsEditorFullWithoutPreviewSchema.html
2013-10-04T18:53:05 <cindyli> :)
2013-10-04T18:53:31 <cindyli> the first long name we were talking about was "SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.html", michelled
2013-10-04T18:53:41 <Bosmon> What is the meaning of "Full" in that new name, cindyli
2013-10-04T18:53:48 <cindyli> full page demo
2013-10-04T18:53:50 <Bosmon> And perhaps "Without" can be replaced with "No"
2013-10-04T18:54:00 <cindyli> nice approach
2013-10-04T18:54:40 <Bosmon> Also, why is there an html file whose name depends on whether there is a Schema or not?
2013-10-04T18:54:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think the builds are working now.. it\'s really hard to test though, anyways you can merge in my changes.
2013-10-04T18:54:54 <cindyli> ok, will do. thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-04T18:54:54 <Bosmon> Couldn\'t we reuse the html file between the schema and non-schema versions?
2013-10-04T18:55:02 <Bosmon> It seems as if all the actual markup would have to be the same
2013-10-04T18:55:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s a manual test
2013-10-04T18:55:16 <Justin_o> so they have different script blocks
2013-10-04T18:55:51 <Bosmon> Ok
2013-10-04T18:55:57 <Bosmon> Well a cumbersome name is fine for test files
2013-10-04T18:58:39 <anastasiac> sorry, I was distracted. catching up
2013-10-04T18:59:09 <anastasiac> one thing: we should be consistent as to whether or not "prefsEditor" goes at the beginning of the name or the end (consistent across fat panel, full page, etc)
2013-10-04T19:00:14 <anastasiac> so we\'re trying to decide between "SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor" and "SeparatedPrefsEditor", and we\'ll have "FullNoPreviewPrefsEditor", etc...
2013-10-04T19:00:28 <anastasiac> "FullPrefsEditor"
2013-10-04T19:01:08 <anastasiac> "FullPrefsEditor" looks odd without "page"\xe2\x80\xa6 full what? It might be mistaken for the fullness of the editing capabilities
