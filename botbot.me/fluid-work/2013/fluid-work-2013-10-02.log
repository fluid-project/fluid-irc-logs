b'2013-10-02T17:12:42 <jhernandez> I added the progressCallback function to the three transactions (search, install and remove)
2013-10-02T17:14:28 <clown> yes, I see.
2013-10-02T17:14:39 <clown> rebuilt, and now I see progress.  +1
2013-10-02T17:21:16 * cindyli has quit
2013-10-02T17:22:00 <clown> jhernandez:  but installPackage() is not installing anything.
2013-10-02T17:22:16 <clown> well, it\'s not installing \'tuxguitar\'
2013-10-02T17:22:26 * clown tries some other package.
2013-10-02T17:23:15 <jhernandez> why not?
2013-10-02T17:23:30 <clown> dunno.  that\'s what I was askin you.  :-)
2013-10-02T17:23:43 <jhernandez> is installing anything? is tuxguitar maybe already installed?
2013-10-02T17:24:16 <clown> no, tuxguitar is not installed.  both \'yum info\' and searchPackage confirm that.
2013-10-02T17:24:31 <clown> when I run installPackage(), progress reports:
2013-10-02T17:24:47 <clown> [nodePackagekit] Transaction status: wait
2013-10-02T17:24:47 <clown> [nodePackagekit] Transaction status: finished
2013-10-02T17:24:47 <clown> true
2013-10-02T17:24:54 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-02T17:24:58 <clown> but it isn\'t installed.
2013-10-02T17:25:24 <jhernandez> maybe bitten by the "sometimes doesn\'t work" bug?
2013-10-02T17:25:25 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-02T17:25:32 <jhernandez> call it twice
2013-10-02T17:25:34 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-10-02T17:25:56 * greggy has quit
2013-10-02T17:26:22 <clown> maybe \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'ll try it twice.  and then I\'m going to try another package (dtach) because that was working on Mon.
2013-10-02T17:26:35 <jhernandez> weird ...
2013-10-02T17:26:44 <jhernandez> it\'s working here
2013-10-02T17:28:19 <clown> nope, neither dtach nor tuxradio install here.  :-(
2013-10-02T17:28:30 <clown> I called installPackage four times.
2013-10-02T17:28:36 <clown> no luck.
2013-10-02T17:29:02 <clown> it isn\'t something silly like I need to be super user, is it?
2013-10-02T17:29:39 <jhernandez> nope
2013-10-02T17:29:42 <jhernandez> you don\'t need to be root
2013-10-02T17:29:49 <clown> hmmmm\xe2\x80\xa6.
2013-10-02T17:29:52 * clown thinks
2013-10-02T17:30:14 <jhernandez> try to go back to the previous commit, build it, and try again
2013-10-02T17:30:40 <jhernandez> AFAIK there is nothing critical in my last commit
2013-10-02T17:30:44 * clown git reset \xe2\x80\x94soft HEAD^
2013-10-02T17:30:49 <jhernandez> --hard
2013-10-02T17:30:57 <jhernandez> git reset --harg HEAD^

2013-10-02T17:31:02 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-02T17:33:18 <clown> I like "harg" better...
2013-10-02T17:45:42 * avtar has quit
2013-10-02T17:46:53 <clown> jhernandez:  I gone back one commit, rebuilt, and installPackage doesn\'t work for that one as well.
2013-10-02T17:47:01 <clown> So:  something wrong with my machine.
2013-10-02T17:47:31 * clown thinks some more
2013-10-02T17:50:29 <jhernandez> mmm
2013-10-02T17:50:52 * jhernandez thinking and talking to people who want to adopt puppies
2013-10-02T17:50:59 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-02T17:52:03 <jhernandez> clown: maybe a stupid question but ... are you passing the package\'s id to install the install method?
2013-10-02T17:52:35 <jhernandez> yesterday a few times I tried to install by passing the package\'s name
2013-10-02T17:52:37 <jhernandez> and not the id
2013-10-02T17:52:58 <jhernandez> xD
2013-10-02T17:52:58 <clown> not a dumb question at all.
2013-10-02T17:53:00 * clown hits forehead with hand.
2013-10-02T17:54:14 <jhernandez> really?
2013-10-02T17:54:15 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2013-10-02T17:59:59 <clown> really, jhernandez.  that was the problem.  I have updated to your latest, recompiled, set DEBUG to TRUE, and now things install.
2013-10-02T18:00:11 <jhernandez> pheeww
2013-10-02T18:00:14 * clown hangs head in shame
2013-10-02T18:00:19 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-10-02T18:00:33 <clown> okay.  back to my unit tests.
2013-10-02T18:00:49 <jhernandez> clown: ok
2013-10-02T18:01:10 <jhernandez> I have to run out in an hour or so
2013-10-02T18:01:27 <jhernandez> JFYI
2013-10-02T18:01:40 <clown> cool.  I should be fine.  If I have questions, I\'ll post them here.  If you are gone, I\'ll email you.
2013-10-02T18:01:45 * jessm joined the channel
2013-10-02T18:02:00 <clown> thanks for your help, as always.
2013-10-02T18:27:04 <jhernandez> clown: yw
2013-10-02T18:27:31 <clown> jhernandez:   I have successful unit tests for search and install.  On to remove....
2013-10-02T18:27:42 <jhernandez> yay!
2013-10-02T18:28:35 * jhernandez is looking forward to see that pull request :]

2013-10-02T18:40:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: however cindyli and I noticed an issue.. There currently isn\'t a way for the compositePanel to do it\'s own rendering..

2013-10-02T19:01:54 <clown> *tests even
2013-10-02T19:10:49 <jhernandez> clown: awesome!
2013-10-02T19:11:19 <jhernandez> I\'m about to leave
2013-10-02T19:11:48 <clown> So:  I\'m not looking at github documentation to see how to put it on my github.  I\'m thinking I have to fork your packagekitBridge first?  Oh, go ahead if you have to.
2013-10-02T19:11:54 <clown> gahh!
2013-10-02T19:11:58 <clown> I\'m NOW looking
2013-10-02T19:12:02 <jhernandez> I\'m going with my parents for the diner
2013-10-02T19:12:17 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-02T19:12:17 <clown> I thought you had something to do with puppies.
2013-10-02T19:12:37 * clown hopes you aren\'t dining on them
2013-10-02T19:12:44 * clown grody.
2013-10-02T19:12:46 <jhernandez> you have to clone my personal fork, and then change to the branch
2013-10-02T19:13:09 <clown> I did that.  But, I did that on my test machine.
2013-10-02T19:13:17 <clown> not on my github account.
2013-10-02T19:13:29 <jhernandez> create your personal branch where you\'re going to make commits, and then create the pull request when done
2013-10-02T19:13:44 <jhernandez> clown: yes, it\'s different from gnome
2013-10-02T19:13:44 <clown> "create your personal branch"  where?
2013-10-02T19:13:49 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-02T19:13:50 <jhernandez> xDD
2013-10-02T19:13:55 <clown> Indeed it is different.
2013-10-02T19:14:04 <clown> gnome uses the "central repository" method.
2013-10-02T19:14:17 <clown> even though the tool is git.
2013-10-02T19:14:47 <clown> I presume I "create your personal branch" on github.  How?
2013-10-02T19:14:58 <jhernandez> yup
2013-10-02T19:15:10 <jhernandez> the workflow is:
2013-10-02T19:15:14 <jhernandez> fork my repo on Github
2013-10-02T19:15:24 * clown I was right!
2013-10-02T19:15:28 * clown go on.
2013-10-02T19:15:36 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-02T19:15:37 <jhernandez> or
2013-10-02T19:15:50 <jhernandez> well
2013-10-02T19:15:51 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-02T19:15:53 <clown> I wrote:  "I\'m thinking I have to fork your packagekitBridge first? "  four minutes ago.
2013-10-02T19:16:03 <jhernandez> I\'m used to use remotes
2013-10-02T19:16:27 <jhernandez> IMVHO, the best workflow could be:
2013-10-02T19:16:34 <jhernandez> 1. fork GPII/linux on Github
2013-10-02T19:16:50 <jhernandez> 2. get your personal copy of the recently forked repo
2013-10-02T19:17:05 <jhernandez> 3. add javihernandez/linux as a remote
2013-10-02T19:18:01 <jhernandez> 4. git checkout javihernandez/packagekitBridge -b <name-of-your-branch>
2013-10-02T19:18:19 <jhernandez> 5. do changes
2013-10-02T19:18:38 <jhernandez> 6. push your new branch to Github
2013-10-02T19:19:05 <jhernandez> 7. make a pull request from your new branch to javihernandez/packagekitBridge
2013-10-02T19:19:38 <jhernandez> 8. I will (or maybe not) accept the changes :P :P :P :P
2013-10-02T19:19:39 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2013-10-02T19:19:45 <clown> "GPII/linux on Github" (step 1) = https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/tree/master, right?
2013-10-02T19:20:02 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/linux
2013-10-02T19:20:24 <clown> yeah, that makes more sense.  (*what is my browser telling me???)
2013-10-02T19:20:39 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-10-02T19:20:57 <jhernandez> or
2013-10-02T19:21:06 <clown> all that makes sense, but I don\'t know how to do 7.
2013-10-02T19:21:10 <jhernandez> git://github.com/GPII/linux.git
2013-10-02T19:21:17 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-02T19:21:35 <jhernandez> it\'s easy
2013-10-02T19:21:49 <clown> but i just found:  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request
2013-10-02T19:22:14 <jhernandez> clown: got it!
2013-10-02T19:22:38 * clown pats himself on the back.
2013-10-02T19:23:14 <clown> okay, go have a nice meal with your parents.  Say "hi" for me.
2013-10-02T19:23:16 <clown> :-)
2013-10-02T19:23:23 <jhernandez> now I gotta run for the diner
2013-10-02T19:23:52 <jhernandez> I hope that my brothers haven\'t ate all the stuff
2013-10-02T19:23:52 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-02T19:24:07 <clown> jhernandez:  you are just a puppy in your own litter.
2013-10-02T19:24:23 <clown> ciao!

2013-10-02T13:27:45 <Justin_o> yzen: hello.. so i pushed up a few more changes to my FLUID-5131 branch.. it includes new tests for the actual rendering..
2013-10-02T13:28:53 <Justin_o> yzen: the rendering does happen properly, but the tests fail. I believe they are failing because the subPanels are still working off of the old pre-rendering DOM nodes
2013-10-02T13:29:04 <Justin_o> yzen: any thoughts on this?
2013-10-02T13:32:25 <jhernandez> colinclark: they are fantastic!
2013-10-02T13:32:56 <jhernandez> all their business are sleep and eat
2013-10-02T13:32:58 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-02T13:33:21 <colinclark> cute!
2013-10-02T13:34:56 <yzen_> Justin_o: when we rewrite selector stuff we use the names not the actual jquery objects right ?
2013-10-02T13:35:19 * clown joined the channel
2013-10-02T13:35:34 <Justin_o> yzen_: yes that\'s correct..
2013-10-02T13:36:28 <yzen_> Justin_o: also the sub panels are initialized before the rendering of the panel happens right ?
2013-10-02T13:38:27 <Justin_o> yzen_: that\'s also correct
2013-10-02T13:39:05 <yzen_> Justin_o: does it make sense to init them after or we need some resolved options ?
2013-10-02T13:41:45 <Justin_o> yzen_: yes.. we need resolved options for the templates and the selectors
2013-10-02T13:42:18 <Justin_o> yzen_: i believe the latter is because we need to know what the components container will be so that we can scope the new selectors in the parent to that
2013-10-02T13:43:04 <Justin_o> yzen_: i suppose we could experiment with getting around those
2013-10-02T13:43:22 * sgithens has quit
2013-10-02T13:43:26 * anastasiac joined the channel
2013-10-02T13:45:21 <yzen_> or perhaps we can use the actual jquery objects instead of names
2013-10-02T13:46:04 <Justin_o> yzen_: what do you mean?
2013-10-02T13:46:41 <yzen_> like using {that}.dom.selectorname instead of selector name when we rewrite it , not sure if it\'s possible to write those things declaratively
2013-10-02T13:47:36 <Justin_o> yzen_: i think the selectors in the parent work... although i haven\'t tried.. but they render out.. so i\'d guess so.. but it\'s the selectors in the subPanel\'s themselves no longer work
2013-10-02T13:48:52 <yzen_> ya i feel like once we initialized the component it gets messed up if we change those things afterwards
2013-10-02T13:49:20 <Justin_o> yzen_: so i took another look and the selectors don\'t use the resolved components.. i\'ll look at the other one again
2013-10-02T13:50:48 <Justin_o> actually it doesn\'t look like any of them do.. so i can try calling init afterRender.. although the afterRender event is shared.. so that would pose a different issue.
2013-10-02T13:52:59 <Justin_o> yzen_: :( the produceTree method needs the resolved component
2013-10-02T13:53:11 <yzen_> hmm
2013-10-02T13:53:52 <Justin_o> yzen_: it needs a reference to the subPanel for getting the expanderOptions, creating the expander, and calling the panel\'s produceTree method
2013-10-02T13:54:02 <yzen_> right yes

2013-10-02T14:02:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: is there a way to pass something down to subcomponents by grade instead of membername using IoCSS?
2013-10-02T14:02:37 * vjoanna joined the channel
2013-10-02T14:04:19 <cindyli> Justin_o: you mean to pass down a grade name into subcomponent\'s gradeNames list, or merge options of the grade into the subcomponent?
2013-10-02T14:11:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: basically i want to change the subcomponents options, for all components of a certain type
2013-10-02T14:17:15 <yzen_> Justin_o, cindyli what would you think the best current strategy is to reconfigure invokers(or other component options for that matter) in test environment without using demands ?
2013-10-02T14:17:26 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m thinking you can add the grade that contains all the options directly to "gradeNames" of those subcomponents beforehand, so you don\'t need to use IoCSS. wonder if you have the grade dynamically generated, don\'t have its name ahead and cannot do it this way?
2013-10-02T14:18:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: i was doing this, but can\'t anymore :(
2013-10-02T14:18:02 <cindyli> yzen_:  pass down the reconfigured invoker via IoCSS
2013-10-02T14:18:17 <yzen_> cindyli: nice thanks
2013-10-02T14:18:42 <cindyli> Justin_o: why?
2013-10-02T14:19:07 <jhernandez> clown: morning!
2013-10-02T14:19:25 <clown> jhrernandez, good afternoon.
2013-10-02T14:19:36 * clown can\'t sepll...
2013-10-02T14:19:44 <clown> jhernandez:  good afternoon.
2013-10-02T14:20:21 <jhernandez> right now I\'m on a meeting
2013-10-02T14:20:22 <clown> I was looking at the testing urls you gave me, and at other examples, and discovered that there two kinds of testing.
2013-10-02T14:20:28 <clown> ah, okay.  I can wait.
2013-10-02T14:20:33 <jhernandez> clown: ok
2013-10-02T14:20:56 <jhernandez> anyhoo ... yes! I passed them to you because of that
2013-10-02T14:21:10 <jhernandez> you can use one of these approaches
2013-10-02T14:21:11 <jhernandez> ;)
2013-10-02T14:21:15 <clown> shall I wait?  Or ask my questions?
2013-10-02T14:22:10 <jhernandez> ask them later
2013-10-02T14:23:01 <jhernandez> meanwhile, update your nodepackageKit branch, I have made a helpful change
2013-10-02T14:23:02 <jhernandez> ;)
2013-10-02T14:23:32 <clown> okay.  time to git stash...
2013-10-02T14:23:35 <clown> maybe.
2013-10-02T14:24:47 <clown> later, jhernandez.  Have a productive meeting.
2013-10-02T14:29:03 <Justin_o> cindyli, yzen_: thanks for talking things over.. okay.. so here\'s the crazy solution... the subPanels are created on an event called initSubPanels. This event is triggered by both the onCreate and afterRender events from the parent.. This unfortunately puts the burden of adding a createOnEvent declaration for the integrator.. The second issue was that we
2013-10-02T14:29:03 <Justin_o> actually needed to share the afterRender event down to the subPanel, but of course it is too late now.. to get around this, there is a new subPanelAfterRender event which is fired as the "last" listener to the parents "afterRender" and triggers the subPanel\'s afterRender event
2013-10-02T14:29:29 <jhernandez> clown: that\'s the commit -> https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/commit/004dd60c3083801ab6f2be6a0739e18ce558cb23
2013-10-02T14:30:31 <clown> jhernandez:  thanks.  I\'ll get to it.  I\'m on a roll with testing; don\'t want to stop just now.
2013-10-02T14:34:34 <jhernandez> np

2013-10-02T15:07:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: i added some documentation for how the compositePanel works to the jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5131
2013-10-02T15:08:33 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, i will read thru
2013-10-02T15:10:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, hopefully it will make sense
2013-10-02T15:12:22 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the compositePanel is something that\'s going to need to be documented as part of the Preferences Framework, no?
2013-10-02T15:14:11 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes it will be
2013-10-02T15:14:34 <anastasiac> ok, I\'ll file a docs JIRA and reference your comments on 5131, so this doesn\'t get lost
2013-10-02T15:14:43 <anastasiac> I\'ll assign it to you, Justin_o :-)
2013-10-02T15:15:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks.. for now the changes are just in my branch but i\'ll look into the documentation on the wiki once it\'s in the repo.
2013-10-02T15:15:58 <anastasiac> yep. that\'s why I\'m filing it and not copying your notes to the wiki now
2013-10-02T15:16:32 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay.. makes sense
2013-10-02T15:16:52 <Justin_o> anastasiac: we should probably also write docs for panels in general and enactors i guess, if you don\'t have tasks for those down alreaday
2013-10-02T15:17:23 <anastasiac> I think I have a task for that, Justin_o, but I\'ll double-check
2013-10-02T15:17:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2013-10-02T15:18:56 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you think there\'s any advantage or disadvantage of creating a "Prefs Framework" JIRA component and starting to tag issues with it at this point?
2013-10-02T15:19:23 <cindyli> Justin_o: i sent a pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/411 to make fat panel onReady returns itself rather than "uiOptions". can you take a look when you have a chance?
2013-10-02T15:19:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i guess that makes sense.. i\'ll create one nwo
2013-10-02T15:20:16 <anastasiac> Thanks, Justin_o. I was just thinking it would be handy to have it, so I could more easily scan the prefs-framework related tech docs issues :-)
2013-10-02T15:20:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'ve added it now.. you should be able to re-assign issues to it
2013-10-02T15:20:45 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-02T15:21:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, will do

2013-10-02T16:53:46 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'ve updated to your latest, and rebuilt.  But I don\'t see any output from the new progress, and installPackage no longer works.  Does progressCallBack() output for you?
2013-10-02T16:55:51 <Justin_o> jhung: i did that this morning
2013-10-02T16:55:59 <Justin_o> left you some comments from my code review there as well
2013-10-02T16:56:26 <jhung> ok Justin_o thanks! I\'ll take a look.

2013-10-02T17:10:21 <jhernandez> and it works
2013-10-02T17:10:26 <jhernandez> at least to me
2013-10-02T17:11:28 <clown> that explains why progress wasn\'t working for me.  But, you need DEBUG for installPackage() as well?
