2013-12-16T21:22:56 <Bosmon> I always think he looks like a CHRISTMAS CATT somehow
2013-12-16T21:24:52 <cindyli> does he? not as much as "I" look like in my profile picture ;-)

2013-12-16T15:01:08 <jhung> anastasiac: I've been looking into static site generators / builders and came across http://docpad.org/  Justin_o said that it may be useful as a tool for documentation since it would allow you to easily mix various languages / frameworks into a single site. Previously I looked at Jekyll and Octopress - and Docpad is so far the easiest and most flexible I've come across.
2013-12-16T15:01:36 <anastasiac> jhung, excellent, thanks for the pointer. I'll have a look

2013-12-16T15:06:33 <jhung> anastasiac: no prob. I've been using it to build a static site using bootstrap, eco templates, and stylus css framework. It supports stuff like grunt, and has its own web server. You can even cat and minify as you save.

2013-12-16T15:07:23 <anastasiac> jhung, sounds very promising! What's your experience been like? how easy/hard is it to work with, use, learn, etc?
2013-12-16T15:08:34 <jhung> anastasiac: so far it's been very smooth. Documentation is pretty good and configuration is a breeze (actually surprised at how easy it was to get it installed and running).
2013-12-16T15:09:05 <jhung> Functionality is added via plugins - so you just download and install what you want. i.e. docpad install less or docpad install grunt etc.
