2013-10-24T09:19:02 <Bosmon> As I can assume it is
2013-10-24T09:19:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Unless there is another "T" in RtF, then yes
2013-10-24T09:19:13 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2013-10-24T09:19:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Greetings, everyone.
2013-10-24T09:20:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I am now on my third day working for RtF on the common terms registry and then the unified listing
2013-10-24T09:20:57 <Bosmon> Your nick can only remind me of this notable picture :)
2013-10-24T09:20:58 <Bosmon> http://bit.ly/16xaIyZ
2013-10-24T09:21:24 <Bosmon> You should really be both the "t" and the "f" in rtf
2013-10-24T09:21:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I was going to go with rtf and m, but figured it was already taken
2013-10-24T09:22:52 <Bosmon> :)

2013-10-24T16:21:21 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o: Should a preference editor\'s default settings be those specified in the primary schema? So if there nothing in the settings store at all, whatever is in the "default" fields in the primary schema should be used?

2013-10-24T18:00:47 <anastasiac> Justin_o and cindyli, I\'m trying to create my own panel using the prefs framework\'s textfieldSlider. I\'m finding that my panel\'s internal model field MUST be called "value" because the fluid.textfieldSlider assumes "value." Is this as intended? Are we ok with this requirement (i.e. that my panel must use "value")? I\'m able to use other keys for other data types that don\'t use textfieldSlider
2013-10-24T18:02:40 <cindyli> anastasiac: don\'t think it makes sense to require panel model must use "value". we should fix textfieldSlider.
2013-10-24T18:03:09 <cindyli> and elsewhere that "value" is required
2013-10-24T18:03:23 <anastasiac> ok, cindyli, I\'ll file a JIRA
2013-10-24T18:03:33 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: yes.. it should probably be updated to use a model relay i guess. it\'s pretty old.. i wonder if this is something that needs to be done now though.. i think Bosmon was going to look at this when he starts the new model relay work
2013-10-24T18:04:02 <anastasiac> booleans are ok, they\'re not dependent on "value"; I\'m going to check the drop-down and radio buttons
2013-10-24T18:04:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks for filing a jira
2013-10-24T18:04:09 <anastasiac> but I suspect they\'ll be ok
2013-10-24T18:05:17 <anastasiac> well, I\'m not sure where the fix needs to go, but it\'s going to feel very weird to write documentation that says "you can call your model field whatever you like, unless you\'re using our textfieldSlider, then you must use \'value\'"

2013-10-24T19:24:27 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli, is there any way for a panel to get access to the enum (for a dropdown) that\'s in the primary schema? Right now, the panel has to reproduce that enum in its controlValues option. It would be nice to avoid that duplication.
2013-10-24T19:25:55 <Justin_o> anastasiac: they can get it from the preferenceMap. you can put a path into the options on the left side, with the key of the primary schema on the right.
2013-10-24T19:26:09 <anastasiac> ah, ok, thanks Justin_o, I\'ll try that
2013-10-24T19:26:53 <anastasiac> Justin_o, worked, thanks for the pointer

2013-10-24T19:57:21 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I\'ll be looking at your updated pulls now
2013-10-24T19:57:31 <Bosmon> btw I have a fix in for the IE8 issue that you and cindyli discovered
2013-10-24T19:58:43 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon.
2013-10-24T20:00:17 <Bosmon> In the end it was caused by the implementation of the new framework fluid.isPlainObject utility
2013-10-24T20:00:26 <Bosmon> Which gives different results on IE8 to other browsers
2013-10-24T20:00:48 <Bosmon> In particular, Object.prototype.toString.call(null) amazingly produces "[object Object]"
