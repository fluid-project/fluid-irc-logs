2013-10-21T18:25:46 <cindyli> anastasiac: regarding http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5181, the API you suggested is to use "templatePath" and "messagePath". I wonder if "templatePrefix" and "messagePrefix" would be better to consistent with these in aux schema?
2013-10-21T18:27:19 <anastasiac> cindyli, I could go either way. For the UIO integrator, they\'re not thinking of the aux schema, and they\'re probably not thinking of prefixes either, they\'re probably just thinking of the path to the files. But you\'re right that we\'ve used prefix everywhere else, so I\'m fine either way. I wonder what Justin_o thinks?
2013-10-21T18:28:37 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: maybe we should rename it everywhere to something like messageRootPath and templateRootPath or something like that
2013-10-21T18:33:35 <cindyli> Justin_o, anastasiac: messageRootPath or messagePath?
2013-10-21T18:33:52 <cindyli> i prefer the latter that is shorter and clear. :P
2013-10-21T18:34:20 <anastasiac> +1 for shorter and clearer :-)
2013-10-21T18:34:42 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: I don\'t mind it, my only worry is that it will be confused for the full path to the file
2013-10-21T18:35:57 <anastasiac> hm. that\'s a good point, Justin_o
2013-10-21T18:36:07 <anastasiac> what are some other options?
2013-10-21T18:36:10 <anastasiac> prefix, of course
2013-10-21T18:36:19 <anastasiac> messageFolder and templateFolder?
2013-10-21T18:44:30 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-21T18:45:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: or messageDir or messageDirname, but i\'m also good with messageFolder
