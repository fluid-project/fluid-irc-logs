b'2013-10-07T18:35:42 <jhernandez> clown: as a clue, our deviceReporter should prvovide the information from this static payload: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/v0.2/testData/deviceReporter/linux_installedSolutions.json
2013-10-07T18:36:03 <jhernandez> heh, look at the architecture overview
2013-10-07T18:37:00 <clown> jhernandez, I just took a peek at "A Detailed Tour of the Cloud4all Architecture", and it looks like the deviceReporter interfaces with the soutionsRegistry.
2013-10-07T18:37:28 <jhernandez> http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Architecture_Overview
2013-10-07T18:37:32 * clown looks at static payload link
2013-10-07T18:38:32 * clown at the architecture overview links.
2013-10-07T18:38:50 <clown> okay, device reporter interfaces with the flowmanager.
2013-10-07T18:39:31 <clown> but the numbers (1, 2, 3, \xe2\x80\xa6) suggest that the flow manager passes the results of the deviceReporter to the matchmaker.
2013-10-07T18:40:08 <clown> jhernandez:  http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/A_Detailed_Tour_of_the_Cloud4all_Architecture
2013-10-07T18:40:48 <clown> especially  http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/A_Detailed_Tour_of_the_Cloud4all_Architecture
2013-10-07T18:40:56 <clown> whoops.
2013-10-07T18:41:02 <clown> I mean, especially:  http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/A_Detailed_Tour_of_the_Cloud4all_Architecture#Device_Characteristics_Reporter
2013-10-07T18:41:12 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-07T18:42:54 <jhernandez> the numbers are meaning the workflow steps, yes
2013-10-07T18:43:41 <jhernandez> and the wiki is fine too
2013-10-07T18:45:18 <jhernandez> in fact, I started a new add-on
2013-10-07T18:45:42 <jhernandez> this time, an xrandr one
2013-10-07T18:46:25 <jhernandez> with this add-on, we will be able to get/set the screen capabilities (screen resolution, brightness, gamma ...)
2013-10-07T18:47:20 <clown> neat
2013-10-07T18:48:25 <jhernandez> and it could be used both by the deviceReporter (to get information) and by a settingsHandler (to get/set settings)
2013-10-07T18:48:25 <jhernandez> clown: does it sounds funny?
2013-10-07T18:48:55 <clown> funny?  no.  It sounds clever.

2013-10-07T19:03:40 <colinclark> michelled, kasparnet: I\'m just reviewing The Artist Formerly Known as Nacho\'s list from today\'s Pilot call, and I noticed that it mentions a "logging tool"
2013-10-07T19:04:09 <colinclark> This is something that hasn\'t been properly prioritized by the architecture team, but I believe is a critical blocker
2013-10-07T19:04:31 <colinclark> We\'ll need to figure out who can do the work
2013-10-07T19:04:38 <colinclark> might be a good project for yzen
2013-10-07T19:07:09 <michelled> colinclark: do you know much about what is meant by \'logging tool\'?
2013-10-07T19:07:17 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-07T19:07:18 <colinclark> somewhat
2013-10-07T19:07:31 <colinclark> They want very fine-grained tracking of a user\'s preference set over the course of usage
2013-10-07T19:09:25 <clown> jhernandez, another topic, while I think about it.
2013-10-07T19:11:18 <clown> I will be at a conference beginning Wed, and am not back in the office until next Tue
2013-10-07T19:11:18 <clown> So, not much time for GPII work this week :-(

2013-10-07T20:12:25 <clown> just got your email, jhernandez.
2013-10-07T20:13:23 <jhernandez> yeah, it\'s basically a "what we\'ve discussed, what we\'ve agreed, where we are and what\'s next" mail
2013-10-07T20:16:00 <clown> While I\'m away, you and the others can decide what\'s next.  :-)
2013-10-07T20:16:25 <jhernandez> I think that some people will want to say something about it

2013-10-07T14:12:33 <cindyli> Justin_o, michelled, with regards to the renaming of UIO to prefs framework, the last remaining issue as I know is whether the demo that uses grade components should be moved into manual tests. do we have a decision on that?
2013-10-07T14:15:11 <michelled> I think it should be moved
2013-10-07T14:15:30 <michelled> cindyli: we are expecting most people to use the schema, right?
2013-10-07T14:18:11 * anastasiac joined the channel
2013-10-07T14:19:14 <cindyli> michelled: yes, i agree. Justin_o, anastasiac, let me know if you have another opinion. otherwise, i will start moving it
2013-10-07T14:26:21 <Justin_o> cindyli: i also think it should be moved
2013-10-07T14:27:00 <cindyli> ok
2013-10-07T14:39:09 <Justin_o> jhung: I merged in your GPII-204 pull request

2013-10-07T15:08:05 <cindyli> michelled: i sent a pull request for UIO renaming - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/414 Can you review it when you have a chance?
2013-10-07T15:09:24 <michelled> thanks cindyli, Justin_o will take a look at it

2013-10-07T17:15:27 <michelled> and it looks fixed on the nightly build too :)

2013-10-07T17:52:25 <cindyli> Justin_o: have you done with all the reviews?
2013-10-07T17:53:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think so
2013-10-07T17:53:18 <cindyli> i left a comment regarding moving UIO demo to framework demos. I don\'t see such a directory for framework demos, or you meant to create one?
2013-10-07T17:53:29 <Justin_o> i replied to that one :)
2013-10-07T17:53:40 <cindyli> cool. thanks, will take a look
2013-10-07T17:53:53 <Justin_o> basically there is no directory for it.. but it\'s organized in the demo portal.
2013-10-07T17:55:04 <cindyli> cool. got you, Justin_o
2013-10-07T17:56:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: any thoughts about renaming generateUIOThemes. I\'m thinking generatePEThemes or generatePrefsEditorThemes
2013-10-07T17:56:51 <Justin_o> The first is shorter, but could be confused with progressive enhancement or something else
2013-10-07T17:57:09 <cindyli> +1 on the second
2013-10-07T17:57:37 <anastasiac> +1 on the second one, Justin_o

2013-10-07T17:59:49 <clown> did you see my email from Friday?
2013-10-07T17:59:54 <jhernandez> of course
2013-10-07T18:00:02 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-07T18:00:19 <clown> did you get chance to look at the new version of the tests?
2013-10-07T18:00:48 * clown waiting for another "of course"  ;-)
2013-10-07T18:01:00 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-07T18:01:08 <jhernandez> of course, but didn\'t tried them
2013-10-07T18:01:33 <clown> okay.  I was just worried that you didn\'t know about them.
2013-10-07T18:01:35 <jhernandez> it\'s time to try them, right now!
2013-10-07T18:01:48 <clown> But you are aware of them, and it is a work in progress.
2013-10-07T18:01:53 <clown> oh, okay.  Cool.
2013-10-07T18:02:25 * clown waiting for comments and requests for changes.
2013-10-07T18:02:37 * jhernandez pulling your branch ...
2013-10-07T18:03:32 * clown crosses fingers
2013-10-07T18:05:09 <jhernandez> you don\'t have to
2013-10-07T18:05:17 <jhernandez> you\'re a rock star!
2013-10-07T18:05:18 <jhernandez> ;)
2013-10-07T18:06:01 <jhernandez> and ... re your friday\'s email
2013-10-07T18:06:12 <jhernandez> you don\'t have to create another pull request
2013-10-07T18:07:00 <jhernandez> just keep commiting on the same branch, and the commits will be included in tue pull request ;)
2013-10-07T18:07:01 <clown> ah, okay.  I was wondering about that.
2013-10-07T18:07:16 <clown> cool.  I guessed correctly!
2013-10-07T18:07:20 <clown> wonders never cease.
2013-10-07T18:07:28 <jhernandez> yup!
2013-10-07T18:08:04 <clown> what do you think about the console.log()s I put in?  I put them there to get some idea of what was being tested, but is there a better way?
2013-10-07T18:12:47 <jhernandez> i am ok with that
2013-10-07T18:12:55 <clown> \\o/
2013-10-07T18:13:01 <jhernandez> (and with the latest changes ofc)
2013-10-07T18:14:53 <clown> so, in terms of mechanics, does this mean you pull into your branch and this work is finished (for now)?
2013-10-07T18:16:30 <jhernandez> merged
2013-10-07T18:17:53 <jhernandez> now we have a packagekit add-on within their associated tests in jqUnit
2013-10-07T18:18:07 <clown> okay.
2013-10-07T18:18:12 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-10-07T18:18:42 <clown> what does this mean about my "packageBridgeTests" branch?  I guess I just switch to your branch, and do an update.
2013-10-07T18:19:04 <clown> something like git pull --rebase.
2013-10-07T18:19:24 <jhernandez> now, we have almost the same with Android (still working on it because I still need to add install and remove capabilities)
2013-10-07T18:19:47 <clown> that\'s good, jhernandez.
2013-10-07T18:19:53 <clown> it\'s good that it\'s mostly "common".
2013-10-07T18:20:03 <jhernandez> yeah, now switch back to my branch, fetch my repo and pull from it
2013-10-07T18:20:15 <clown> Okay.
2013-10-07T18:21:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'ve fixe the two build related issues in my FLUID-5161 branch
2013-10-07T18:21:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you need help with any of the other parts?
2013-10-07T18:21:54 <clown> I\'m thinking the next step is more unit tests, but from a webserver perspective, along the lines of these tests:  https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/tree/packagekitBridge/node_modules/gsettingsBridge/tests
2013-10-07T18:22:11 <clown> (that\'s a weird url).
2013-10-07T18:22:27 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, i will merge in your branch. can you take a look on contrast icons
2013-10-07T18:22:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure will do
2013-10-07T18:22:45 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-07T18:22:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: can you also double check my changes when you pull them in
2013-10-07T18:22:59 <cindyli> sure
2013-10-07T18:23:03 <Justin_o> thanks
2013-10-07T18:25:00 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-10-07T18:25:00 <jhernandez> clown: more or less
2013-10-07T18:26:26 <clown> I\'ll make a start on it, then.
2013-10-07T18:26:26 * sgithens has quit
2013-10-07T18:26:47 <jhernandez> right now we should start thinking on the deviceReporter integration from the core architecture perspective
2013-10-07T18:27:11 <clown> okay.
2013-10-07T18:27:42 <clown> so, what is the core architecture (the matchmaker?) expecting to get from us?
2013-10-07T18:27:51 * clown thinking out loud
2013-10-07T18:28:00 <Justin_o> cindyli: fixed the contrast panel.. seems like we lost something in a merge somewhere.. but it\'s all sorted out now... you can pull it down from my branch
2013-10-07T18:28:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: need help with anything else?
2013-10-07T18:28:30 <clown> correction:  what is the matchmaker expecting to get from the deviceReporter?
2013-10-07T18:29:13 <jhernandez> to do that, I have to finish my non-sent-mail, resuming the current status of our device reporting in Linux and Android and my thoughts about the next steps
2013-10-07T18:30:11 <clown> okay, over to you jhernandez :-)
2013-10-07T18:30:12 <jhernandez> the core architecture == core\'s deviceReporter, yes
2013-10-07T18:30:41 <cindyli> that was fast, Justin_o. thanks. other than text size you\'ve noticed, i found line spacing also doesn\'t apply to the iframe, do you want to take a look on that?
2013-10-07T18:30:58 <jhernandez> and re the matchMaker, not sure
2013-10-07T18:31:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure i\'ll take a look at those
2013-10-07T18:31:12 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-07T18:31:44 <clown> i\'m just wondering what part of the architecture is getting information from the deviceReporter \xe2\x80\x94 I thought it was the matchmaker, but I shall review.
