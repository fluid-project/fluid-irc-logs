2013-12-23T17:46:32 <colinclark> Hey yzen, are you around?
2013-12-23T17:46:50 <yzen> online for now yep
2013-12-23T17:48:14 <colinclark> Can I ask a quick question?
2013-12-23T17:48:16 <yzen> sure
2013-12-23T17:48:25 <colinclark> I\'m trying to make a Kettle app for the first time
2013-12-23T17:48:31 <yzen> yep
2013-12-23T17:48:40 <colinclark> And I think I\'m piecing it together just by looking at the examples
2013-12-23T17:48:58 <colinclark> It seems to me that I need a config, and to include the kettleModuleLoader.js in my config directory
2013-12-23T17:49:18 <colinclark> And in my config I can setup a server component
2013-12-23T17:49:27 <yzen> yep
2013-12-23T17:49:29 <colinclark> and, I think, a server component will have an app component
2013-12-23T17:49:35 <yzen> yes
2013-12-23T17:49:41 <colinclark> What actually drives the initialization process?
2013-12-23T17:49:48 <colinclark> In other words, what makes the server run?
2013-12-23T17:49:59 <yzen> so the way you run the app
2013-12-23T17:50:22 <yzen> NODE_EVN={config file name} node kettle/lib/init.js path/to/config/folder
2013-12-23T17:50:27 <yzen> so init.js
2013-12-23T17:50:39 <yzen> reads the config based on NODE_ENV and the folder path
2013-12-23T17:50:47 <yzen> reads all includes and modules
2013-12-23T17:51:01 <yzen> for each config config loader creates a grade
2013-12-23T17:51:16 <yzen> and then just calls the top level grade name as a creator function
2013-12-23T17:51:28 <colinclark> ok, so for example
2013-12-23T17:51:49 <colinclark> ah, I\'ve got it
2013-12-23T17:52:07 <colinclark> I kept searching for where init.js was referenced within Kettle itself
2013-12-23T17:52:30 <colinclark> But the app needs to bootstrap itself by invoking init.js
2013-12-23T17:52:52 <yzen> sort of , it just calls things from configLoader.js
2013-12-23T17:53:02 <colinclark> yep, I saw that
2013-12-23T17:53:11 <yzen> well you don\'t need to use the config approach at all if you want you can simply create a server component with an app subcomponent and just run it
2013-12-23T17:53:12 <yzen> all in js
2013-12-23T17:54:07 <colinclark> It seems like the config approach is a fair bit more flexible
2013-12-23T17:54:21 <colinclark> So, for my app which depends on Kettle, something like this should do the trick?
2013-12-23T17:54:31 <colinclark> NODE_ENV=development; node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js ./configs/
2013-12-23T17:55:09 <yzen> yes, also development is a default so you don\'t have to specify that at all
2013-12-23T17:55:16 <colinclark> cool
2013-12-23T17:55:50 <colinclark> I think that should do it, thanks so much
2013-12-23T17:56:21 <yzen> np :)
2013-12-23T17:56:42 <yzen> btw if you are still up for the beers this week we should do it :)
2013-12-23T17:57:01 <yzen> i think avtar might also be interested
2013-12-23T18:02:08 <sgithens> colinclark : Are you kettling flocking?
2013-12-23T18:10:12 * yzen has quit
2013-12-23T18:18:33 <colinclark> sgithens: I will be
2013-12-23T18:18:44 <colinclark> but I\'m actually making a cat cam for the few days when we\'ll be away at Christmas
2013-12-23T18:18:49 <colinclark> so we can watch Hugo sleep :P
2013-12-23T18:21:39 <sgithens> hahahahaha
2013-12-23T18:21:42 <sgithens> htat\'s awesome
2013-12-23T18:22:08 <sgithens> will you put it up on github?  More examples of minimal/small kettle apps would be great
2013-12-23T18:22:14 <colinclark> yes
2013-12-23T18:22:25 <colinclark> the idea is that it will serve, ultimately, as our first documented Kettle example
2013-12-23T18:22:28 <colinclark> super minimal
2013-12-23T18:22:55 <sgithens> vs undocumented ones like GPII :p
2013-12-23T18:23:57 <colinclark> yes :)
2013-12-23T18:24:06 <colinclark> it was a pretty perplexing experience, last night
2013-12-23T18:24:24 <colinclark> just sort of surveying this range of apps we have, which apparently magically work :)
2013-12-23T18:24:40 <colinclark> and trying to reproduce it
2013-12-23T18:25:49 <sgithens> colinclark: Yes.  Also, I\'m hoping to finish my initial static doc esprima experiment over the holiday, to make the API browesable, (along with source when you really need to see what\'s going on!)
2013-12-23T18:26:02 <colinclark> Awesome!
2013-12-23T18:26:09 <colinclark> I have too many projects scheduled for the holiday at this point
2013-12-23T18:26:16 <colinclark> and it looks like I might end up just having to write instead
2013-12-23T18:26:26 <colinclark> but I built my Arduino knobs yesterday
2013-12-23T18:26:27 <colinclark> super easy
2013-12-23T18:26:47 <colinclark> Now I just need to get it to send OSC messages and I\'ll hook it up to my crazy new odroid-xu board
2013-12-23T18:26:55 <colinclark> and I\'ll have a tiny synthesizer built with Flocking
2013-12-23T18:27:22 <sgithens> that\'s awesome
2013-12-23T18:28:00 <sgithens> Today I\'m actually trying to finish my last 23rd jira...
2013-12-23T18:28:05 <colinclark> awesome
2013-12-23T18:28:20 <sgithens> I\'ll have a little time this week.  I\'m actually over in Mass now
2013-12-23T18:28:25 <sgithens> on the Cape of Cods
2013-12-23T18:28:45 <colinclark> ah, wow
2013-12-23T18:28:46 <colinclark> that\'s great
2013-12-23T18:28:47 <colinclark> how is it?
2013-12-23T18:28:48 <sgithens> OSC?
2013-12-23T18:29:00 <sgithens> nice.  It\'s pretty rainy and not too cold yet
2013-12-23T18:29:05 <sgithens> high quality fog
2013-12-23T18:29:16 <sgithens> good for software development
2013-12-23T18:29:20 <colinclark> :)
2013-12-23T18:29:24 <colinclark> OSC is "Open Sound Control"
2013-12-23T18:29:32 <colinclark> People describe it as the successor to MIDI
2013-12-23T18:29:37 <sgithens> ah
2013-12-23T18:29:37 <colinclark> but that\'s somewhat misleading
2013-12-23T18:29:50 <colinclark> but, anyway, most hip controllers these days support OSC
2013-12-23T18:31:21 <sgithens> Do you know if we need to support unicode names for the pilot ( I know we will eventually ).  Like the names that go on the RFID tags
2013-12-23T18:31:57 <colinclark> If it\'s a corner you feel like you need to cut, go for it
2013-12-23T18:32:08 <colinclark> We definitely will need to support it sooner rather than later
2013-12-23T18:32:08 <sgithens> I\'m sort of hoping not, since I don\'t think it actually works right now.  But will check it out
2013-12-23T18:32:11 <colinclark> ok
2013-12-23T18:32:15 <colinclark> I think we can live with that
2013-12-23T18:34:44 <colinclark> My real goal over the holidays, sgithens, is to do some work on the Flocking "Playground" (including renaming it) :P
2013-12-23T18:35:18 <colinclark> I want to add a live JSON editor, so that as you change your "synthDef" in the CodeMirror editor, the playing synth will automatically change
2013-12-23T18:35:40 <sgithens> oooh
2013-12-23T18:35:41 <colinclark> and then to sketch out, as a separate view, a "boxes and wires" interface for synthDefs
2013-12-23T18:35:47 <colinclark> JSONic Authoring
2013-12-23T18:35:54 <sgithens> nice
2013-12-23T18:36:16 <sgithens> what are you going to use for the boxes and wires... and also how long are you on holiday :)
2013-12-23T18:36:21 <colinclark> That\'s the problem
2013-12-23T18:36:30 <colinclark> I still have a few abstracts and a report to write :(
2013-12-23T18:36:46 <colinclark> I think I\'m going to use something called JSPlumb for the boxes and wires, though I\'m not certain
2013-12-23T18:36:58 <colinclark> I\'ll need to do some more research

2013-12-23T19:49:05 <Bosmon> colinclark - talking of JSONIC AUTHOURING, I actually had a demo yesterday of that historic product, NOODLE....
2013-12-23T19:50:04 <Bosmon> Yes, getting my CATT CAMM working is my last pre-flight task now
2013-12-23T19:50:11 <Bosmon> Other than having breakfast...
2013-12-23T20:00:04 <colinclark> ah, you saw Noodle!
2013-12-23T20:00:05 <colinclark> That\'s excellent
2013-12-23T20:00:22 <colinclark> I really do love its "hand-etched" aesthetic

2013-12-23T21:33:10 <colinclark> sgithens: Sorry I missed your question earlier
2013-12-23T21:33:22 <colinclark> Noodle is Clayton Lewis\' flow-based programming environment
2013-12-23T21:33:32 <colinclark> intended to support "non-visual visual programming"
