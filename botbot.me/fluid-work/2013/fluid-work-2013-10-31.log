b'2013-10-31T19:16:39 <anastasiac> Bosmon, thanks for your patience. I hope it\'s enough info

2013-10-31T19:24:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think so.. in fact i have fixes for FLUID-5201 and FLUID-5202 already in branches in my repo
2013-10-31T19:24:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any recommendations on how to take care of FLUID-5200 though
2013-10-31T19:25:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, surely the answer is just that you should do the necessary rewriting? : P

2013-10-31T19:25:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i remember correctly "..::" is a reference to some parent.. and these could be or arbitrary length, depending on nesting within the tree.. is that correct?
2013-10-31T19:26:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine that\'s not relevant since you always rewrite the tree in order to keep the original siblings next to each other?
2013-10-31T19:26:42 <Bosmon> So the first segment I imagine will always stay fixed as ..:: ?
2013-10-31T19:27:18 <Bosmon> I imagine all you need to do is insert the correct prefix after that point
2013-10-31T19:27:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but what about the trees within the sub panels that could themselves have complex renderer trees
2013-10-31T19:28:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I believe you are already rewriting everything?
2013-10-31T19:28:01 <Justin_o> or i guess i\'ll never change those one
2013-10-31T19:28:18 <Bosmon> So you are presumably already touching the entire protoTree from each panel
2013-10-31T19:28:35 <Justin_o> yes.. just wondering if i might inherit complex trees from the subpanels
2013-10-31T19:28:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way here\'s my fluid-5185 branch https://github.com/jobara/infusion/tree/FLUID-5185
2013-10-31T19:28:57 <Bosmon> THanks, Justin_o
2013-10-31T19:29:04 <Bosmon> So many things beginning with J!
2013-10-31T19:29:13 <Justin_o> which has the start of the upgrades, currently qUnit, as well as getting the new jQuery UI and removing old plugins
2013-10-31T19:29:26 <Justin_o> :)
2013-10-31T19:29:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you think i could just do a search for ..:: and should not encounter anything more complex than that?
2013-10-31T19:31:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that ought to be fine
2013-10-31T19:31:35 <Bosmon> Hopefully we will have a proper renderer by the time people start writing things that are much more complex : P
2013-10-31T19:31:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll try to fix that up quickly then so that i can get you a pull request before i leave.. if not i\'ll try to send you one later tonight
2013-10-31T19:31:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2013-10-31T19:32:15 <Justin_o> i was telling cindyli we\'d hopefully be able to throw this all away soon.. with the new renderer on the horizon
2013-10-31T19:33:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a name for "..::"
2013-10-31T19:34:41 <Justin_o> i guess it\'s parentRelativeId
2013-10-31T19:36:22 <Bosmon> That is what it is
2013-10-31T19:46:19 <anastasiac> Yay! Bosmon\'s 4258 branch has been merged!
2013-10-31T19:46:46 <Bosmon> DECCKLARATTIVE CHANGES are now available for all :)
2013-10-31T19:46:54 <Bosmon> All we need to do now is document them : P

2013-10-31T12:53:42 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. i\'m just taking a look at your code now.. so you are getting an error about the iframe still?
2013-10-31T12:54:28 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: yes, if i remove the frame markup and that.jQuery error if i add it
2013-10-31T12:55:47 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: interesting.. looking at the code i would have thought that what you did would have changed the prefsEditor.. let me try to run it.
2013-10-31T12:56:12 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: OK
2013-10-31T13:01:54 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: it has to do with the renaming.. you need to change uioType to prefsEditorType
2013-10-31T13:02:10 <Justin_o> in your demo.js file
2013-10-31T13:03:11 <Justin_o> i\'ll reply to your e-mail about that as well.

2013-10-31T16:21:05 <amilchev> hi Justin_o, I\'m not sure if you understood my question in the list - [Ux] Combining two or more textfieldSteppers inside one panel
2013-10-31T16:22:01 <Justin_o> amilchev: would you like to talk about it here a bit more
2013-10-31T16:22:11 <amilchev> Justin_o: exactly
2013-10-31T16:22:52 <amilchev> Justin_o: I pushed it in a new branch, you could run this file https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-271/demos/pcp/index.html
2013-10-31T16:23:13 <amilchev> Justin_o: and see how the two textfieldSteppers share the same value
2013-10-31T16:24:35 <amilchev> Justin_o: this is really work in process, ignore anything that seems strange to you :) I\'m just trying to have 2 textfieldSteppers working in the same panel (with no success).
2013-10-31T16:26:18 <amilchev> Justin_o: you could type "hook.model" in the console to check the current model - the upper textfieldStepper\'s value is stored in "value", the second one - "value2"
2013-10-31T16:27:24 <amilchev> tell me what you get whenever you can, it\'s not that urgent
2013-10-31T16:29:11 * avtar has quit
2013-10-31T16:30:18 <Justin_o> amilchev: sorry, was looking through the code.. where is the preference map?
2013-10-31T16:31:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-271/src/shared/adjusters/pcp/js/speakTextPanels.js#L39-L74
2013-10-31T16:33:50 <amilchev> Justin_o: here are the decorators: https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-271/src/shared/adjusters/pcp/js/speakTextCollectivePanel.js#L22-L49
2013-10-31T16:38:11 <Justin_o> i\'m going to guess that this is the problem https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-271/src/shared/adjusters/pcp/js/textfieldStepper.js#L149
2013-10-31T16:41:47 <amilchev> yeah, sounds like it is...
2013-10-31T16:41:51 <Justin_o> actually maybe it\'s line 145 that is the problem
2013-10-31T16:43:01 <Justin_o> i guess they work together.. so you are sharing the model, which is updated externally by the other, and thus triggers model to update on the next one.
2013-10-31T16:43:05 <Justin_o> at least it looks like that..
2013-10-31T16:44:12 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, for now you should actually just make these completely separate panels and not worry about combining them into a larger panel.. I\'ll have the composite panel ready for use soon.. although anastasiac uncovered some bugs in it that i\'m trying to weed out at the moment
2013-10-31T16:44:35 <Justin_o> amilchev: but you should fix up this issue too.. i would suggest making use of the modelRelay system for now
2013-10-31T16:45:16 <amilchev> Justin_o: isn\'t modelRelay useful when we need to coordinate two components\' models?
2013-10-31T16:46:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. but you are sort of doing that now, by sharing a model directly, as is on line 145
2013-10-31T16:46:48 <Justin_o> amilchev: you should just keep the models separate and use the model relay to keep them in sync
2013-10-31T16:47:22 <amilchev> Justin_o: ohh, I don\'t want them synchronised in any way
2013-10-31T16:47:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: they have nothing to do with each other
2013-10-31T16:48:13 <amilchev> Justin_o: I need them completely independant..
2013-10-31T16:48:31 <Justin_o> amilchev: right not between the two textfieldSteppers for sure.. but you want the model of a textfieldStepper to be inSync with it\'s parent..
2013-10-31T16:49:04 <amilchev> Justin_o: for that, yes undoubtedly..
2013-10-31T16:49:33 <Justin_o> amilchev: so you\'ll need the model relay for that
2013-10-31T16:49:41 <Justin_o> amilchev: right now by sharing the model like this https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/gpii-271/src/shared/adjusters/pcp/js/textfieldStepper.js#L145
2013-10-31T16:50:06 <Justin_o> you are actually giving both of the textfieldSteppers the same model
2013-10-31T16:50:51 <Justin_o> internally the textfieldStepper only works on the model path "value"
2013-10-31T16:57:30 <amilchev> Justin_o: I think this was a temporary solution Evgeni created..
2013-10-31T16:58:15 <amilchev> Justin_o: thanks, I\'ll stick to creating separate panels for each adjuster
2013-10-31T17:02:12 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. let me know if you need anything else

2013-10-31T18:21:27 <anastasiac> I\'ve commented to that effect on the 5202 jira

2013-10-31T19:05:41 <yzen> hi the-t-in-rtf
2013-10-31T19:05:44 <yzen> i think so last week
2013-10-31T19:06:23 <colinclark> Cool
2013-10-31T19:06:41 <colinclark> So, Tony (i.e. the-t-in-rtf) is working on the Common Terms Registry
2013-10-31T19:06:45 <colinclark> I made a new repo for it today
2013-10-31T19:06:49 <colinclark> in the GPII github org
2013-10-31T19:07:05 <colinclark> He was also mentioning how terribly inadequate our Kettle documentation is, in terms of working examples
2013-10-31T19:07:09 <colinclark> which of course is to be expected
2013-10-31T19:07:14 <colinclark> for such new software
2013-10-31T19:07:31 <colinclark> but I\'m hoping you might be able to answer his questions and share some examples of how you\'ve used it, if he needs it
2013-10-31T19:09:06 <yzen> colinclark, the-t-in-rtf definitely
2013-10-31T19:09:13 <colinclark> awesome
2013-10-31T19:09:22 <colinclark> he tends to work on Thursdays and Fridays, I think
