b'2013-09-18T20:13:28 <Bosmon> With the current IoC system, it\'s possible to have i) APIs that aren\'t "flat" (that is, expose a recursive structure of reusable blocks) but which are nontheless ii) stable, but without iii) the user having to manually write "facade" code for bridging or brokering by hand
2013-09-18T20:14:12 <Bosmon> Typically even flat, stable APIs were a challenge in previous systems
2013-09-18T20:14:29 <colinclark> okay, so now can you connection this notion of "refactoring" to user personalization?
2013-09-18T20:14:34 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-09-18T20:14:48 <Bosmon> I guess you could say that this connection amounts to considering "stability over space, as well as stability over time"
2013-09-18T20:15:21 <Bosmon> You could see that personalization is just another case of "multiple implementations coexisting harmoniously under the same options structure" as refactoring
2013-09-18T20:15:59 <Bosmon> Certainly if the developer can\'t maintain the stability of their OWN artifacts for their own purposes, they could hardly commit to maintaining stability on behalf of changes required by their users
2013-09-18T20:16:12 <Bosmon> So you could say that at a minimum, the one kind of stability is a prerequisite for the other

2013-09-18T15:21:13 <avtar> if someone wants to test the preferences server using the production config
2013-09-18T15:21:28 <yzen> avtar: yes this is very vague right now,
2013-09-18T15:21:37 <avtar> ok
2013-09-18T15:21:49 <yzen> as far as i know steve had a tool that we used to upload the records

2013-09-18T15:22:19 <avtar> oops
2013-09-18T15:22:49 <avtar> we\'ve been relying on backups of the couchdb data when new preference server instances need to be spun up
2013-09-18T15:23:27 <avtar> so i was wondering why someone else, who doesn\'t have access to preferences.gpii.net backups, has to go through an extra step to modify the test preferences in order for them to be useful

2013-09-18T16:23:15 <michelled> colinclark: I just make a pull request that fixes the styling for the contrast panel in UIO https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/406
2013-09-18T16:23:25 <michelled> it\'s part of the 4922 work
2013-09-18T16:25:01 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I guess the fast invoker fix means a bit of an API change. users will now have to specify when they expect an invoker to be dynamic.
2013-09-18T16:25:07 <michelled> Justin_o, anastasiac ^
2013-09-18T16:25:08 * greggy joined the channel
2013-09-18T16:26:20 <Justin_o> michelled: it\'s unfortunate.. i guess we need to document this and explain when something will need to be dynamic or not. probably okay for the release though as IoC wasn\'t really production in 1.4
2013-09-18T16:26:41 * kasparnet joined the channel
2013-09-18T16:30:08 <colinclark> This is why I want to get 1.5 out and move on as soon as possible
2013-09-18T16:30:42 <colinclark> we end up in these situations where we have to consider a weaker API in order to preserve backwards compatibility of features that were largely unused by third party developers
2013-09-18T16:30:49 <colinclark> so I\'m tempted to agree with Justin_o here
2013-09-18T16:31:09 <colinclark> Certainly the semantics of the default configuration of an invoker have indeed changed, michelled
2013-09-18T16:31:15 <colinclark> But it\'s split down the middle
2013-09-18T16:31:40 <colinclark> presumably users would be equally pleased to get a 200x speed increase in their existing invokers, when they don\'t require dynamic evaluation of their arguments
2013-09-18T16:32:39 * jhung has quit
2013-09-18T16:33:55 <michelled> I agree that as long as we document this for 1.5 we are good
2013-09-18T16:34:04 <michelled> the new invokers are certainly much shinier :)

2013-09-18T18:41:39 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that must be a new issue.. the one in the jira was caused by the location they were in.. i\'ve tested these recently while working on UIO and they had been passing
2013-09-18T18:41:46 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do they work locally for you?
2013-09-18T18:42:32 <anastasiac> yes, Justin_o, they work locally for me (i.e. through localhost)
2013-09-18T18:43:27 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I think we should reopen this one, no? the tests don\'t run on the build site. Or do we consider that acceptable?
2013-09-18T18:44:09 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ah my mistake, the issue should be reopened.. the js files it tries to run are missing
2013-09-18T18:44:36 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i had misread this as the test files were missing
2013-09-18T18:45:35 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone, shall we gather for the community meeting? Toronto folks, in the collab room (donuts!!). Bosmon, Bosmon8, colinclark, will you be able to join us remotely for another docs sprint?

2013-09-18T19:50:36 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'m wondering if you can help me with a summary
2013-09-18T19:50:48 <Bosmon> Hi colinclark
2013-09-18T19:50:50 <colinclark> I\'d like to make a list to use as a writing platform
2013-09-18T19:51:01 <colinclark> Keeping in mind that my audience isn\'t particular technical
2013-09-18T19:51:18 <colinclark> but I\'m hoping you could help me summarize the "things we do" to enable an application to be personalizable
2013-09-18T19:51:26 <colinclark> And I guess this happens at several layers
2013-09-18T19:51:35 <colinclark> from how we create our CSS and markup down into more "substantial" concerns
2013-09-18T19:53:11 <colinclark> So, to start, is there anything you\'d highlight about how we handle the so-called "presentation layer" of a web application--i.e. its CSS and markup?
2013-09-18T19:55:51 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s a good question...
2013-09-18T19:55:57 <Bosmon> I\'m struggling to think of anything very specific
2013-09-18T19:56:38 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-18T19:56:42 <Bosmon> Naturally there are the obvious good practices... of, for example, actually having a separate CSS file at all : P
2013-09-18T19:56:51 <Bosmon> Can you give me a few hints about any angles you are thinking of?
2013-09-18T19:57:13 <Bosmon> In general we aim to place as few constraints as possible on what designers may do with the CSS and markup layer
2013-09-18T19:57:41 <Bosmon> And part of the upcoming rendering work would be targetted at removing some of the constraints that we currently do impose (for example, the need for extra <div>s in some places)
2013-09-18T19:58:02 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-18T19:58:07 <Bosmon> I guess the important thing is that we aim to "intensify" the existing good practice of binding onto the markup layer using stable selectors
2013-09-18T19:58:12 <colinclark> I\'m in a strange section of the document
2013-09-18T19:58:27 <colinclark> that has just highlighted the lack of viability of the "transcoding" approach
2013-09-18T19:58:36 <colinclark> i.e. after-the-fact transformation of web content
2013-09-18T19:58:46 <Bosmon> In theory this is something that a good designer will do anyway, but if an application is to be radically reskinned in various ways, this system of "spines" operated by selectors which targets many different sets of markup need to be more secure than usual
2013-09-18T19:58:51 <colinclark> And so I\'m trying to steer the discussion to a more significant level
2013-09-18T19:59:05 <colinclark> Here is the paragraph I\'ve written so far
2013-09-18T19:59:15 <colinclark> "In contrast to the pitfalls of after-the-fact transcoding, the PGA architecture emphasizes the importance of building applications from the beginning to be personalization-aware. This requires a different approach to software development. Instead of hardcoding a single user interface and underlying programming logic, personalizable applications need to support flexible connections between modular user interfaces and underlying services."
2013-09-18T19:59:29 <Bosmon> ok
2013-09-18T19:59:37 <colinclark> I utterly loathe the term "services" since it evokes a very enterprise-y conception of SOA
2013-09-18T19:59:48 <Bosmon> I guess the "flexible connections" leads into the "stable selectors" discussion
2013-09-18T20:00:02 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-18T20:00:53 <Bosmon> And in theory, that "stable selectors" discussion then leads into the equivalent one for component trees
2013-09-18T20:02:27 <colinclark> so keep going, in terms of the next level in application development
2013-09-18T20:03:08 <Bosmon> At the next level in application development, these "stable names" are extended into the world of code, in terms of "well-known grade names and their well-known options"
2013-09-18T20:03:29 <Bosmon> And the framework assists the developer in maintaining this stability by schemes such as grade merging and the IoCSS system
2013-09-18T20:03:45 <Bosmon> Which allows ambitious refactorings to take place whilst maintaining stable grades names and options structures
2013-09-18T20:04:13 <Bosmon> As well as allowing substantially different implementations to coexist under these same names
2013-09-18T20:07:09 <colinclark> michelled, Justin_o: Do we have a list of all our current enactors somewhere?
2013-09-18T20:08:22 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think just this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/Enactors.js
2013-09-18T20:09:24 <colinclark> thanks, Justin_o
2013-09-18T20:09:50 <colinclark> so, I\'m trying to figure out how to explain this notion of "stable grades" to a non-techy
2013-09-18T20:09:57 <colinclark> I realize this is a challenge
2013-09-18T20:10:01 * Justin_o has quit
2013-09-18T20:10:03 <colinclark> but can you think of some examples of this in practice
2013-09-18T20:10:20 <colinclark> or, if we have to stay abstract, describe what role a "stable name" plays?
2013-09-18T20:10:26 <Bosmon> I guess all of the good examples would be from UIOptions
2013-09-18T20:10:50 <Bosmon> For example, that ambitious refactoring that cindyli1 did last month, which removed an entire layer of containment from the component structure
2013-09-18T20:10:55 <colinclark> I guess the point is that every "connection" between components is visible and configurable
2013-09-18T20:11:07 <Bosmon> This is something that could never have been survived in a traditional OO system
2013-09-18T20:11:24 <Bosmon> But in fact none of our APIs had to change
2013-09-18T20:11:54 <Bosmon> Similar but more minor things occurred when I rewrote our "old components" into the IoC format

2013-09-18T12:37:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: hi
2013-09-18T12:37:52 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello
2013-09-18T12:38:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: tell me if you have time to explain how end-to-end connectivity could be managed
2013-09-18T12:39:40 <amilchev> Justin_o: what I want is to pass the saved settings from the panel properly - as far as Evgeni told me, to define something like this https://github.com/tsakov/universal/blob/node-webkit/gpii/node_modules/personalControlPanel/src/content/deps/GPIIStore.js
2013-09-18T12:40:59 <amilchev> Justin_o: is there anything other than defining the invokers "fetch" and "save"
2013-09-18T12:41:48 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-09-18T12:42:39 <amilchev> I\'ll be here for three hours more, if any of this time interval is comfortable to you to help, please let me now
2013-09-18T12:43:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: looking at it right now
2013-09-18T12:43:33 <Justin_o> amilchev: here is where the store is defined in infusion https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/Store.js
2013-09-18T12:45:27 <Justin_o> amilchev: so you could just create your own store with a base grade of dataSource and define the invokers for get and set
2013-09-18T12:47:22 * mrvisser has quit
2013-09-18T12:48:23 <Justin_o> amilchev: you wouldn\'t need to use the demands blocks though as in the example for infusion, to override get and set, you can just do that in the configuration by assigning a new function to the invokers.
2013-09-18T12:50:06 <Justin_o> amilchev: if you are going to use the globalSettingStore though you will want to change the type from fluid.cookieStore to your new one
2013-09-18T12:52:10 <Justin_o> amilchev: these are attached to the uiOptions through grade merging https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/UIOptions.js#L220-L235
2013-09-18T12:52:56 <amilchev> Justin_o: should I define a static environment "gpii.pcp" and define the grade this way:
2013-09-18T12:52:56 <amilchev> fluid.defaults("gpii.pcp.store",
2013-09-18T12:52:56 <amilchev> gradeNames: ["fluid.uiOptions.dataSource", "autoInit"],
2013-09-18T12:52:56 <amilchev> ...);
2013-09-18T12:53:11 <amilchev> the component*
2013-09-18T12:53:14 * kasparnet has quit
2013-09-18T12:53:49 * yzen has quit
2013-09-18T12:55:52 <Justin_o> amilchev: so it looks like the gpii.pcp static environment is there so that the demands block can be set to switch the type of store..
2013-09-18T12:56:20 <amilchev> yes
2013-09-18T12:56:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: you can avoid the demands block by creating your own version of fluid.globalSettingsStore and changing the type of settingsStore there to your new one.
2013-09-18T12:56:54 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-18T12:57:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok
2013-09-18T12:57:22 <Justin_o> then you\'d pass in this new globalSettingsStore to your assembled uio by changing the type of its store subcomponent to your new globalSettingsStore
2013-09-18T12:57:57 <Justin_o> amilchev: the defaults call you have above looks good
2013-09-18T13:00:03 <amilchev> hmm so let me see if I got it:
2013-09-18T13:01:16 <amilchev> Justin_o: I create my own component of grade name dataSource and there I override invokers get and set
2013-09-18T13:01:31 <amilchev> and then
2013-09-18T13:02:33 * sgithens_ has quit
2013-09-18T13:03:32 <amilchev> Justin_o: I create a component of grade name fluid.globalSettingsStore and this type https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/Store.js#L146 is the one that I just mentioned
2013-09-18T13:04:05 <Justin_o> sounds good so far
2013-09-18T13:06:23 * mrvisser has quit
2013-09-18T13:07:22 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-18T13:10:32 <amilchev> Justin_o: how should functions get and set look like?
2013-09-18T13:10:47 * greggy joined the channel
2013-09-18T13:11:20 <amilchev> Justin_o: I suppose "{arguments}.0" is where the saved settings are preserved

2013-09-18T13:13:18 * jessm joined the channel
2013-09-18T13:13:41 <Justin_o> amilchev: they could really take whichever signature is necessary.. with invokers you can specify the args where something like "{arguments}.0" is used to refer to the arguments passed in when the invoker is called.. this allows you to have an invoker that takes in a different set of arguments than the underlying function
2013-09-18T13:13:59 <Justin_o> amilchev: you can see that here https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/Store.js#L59
2013-09-18T13:14:10 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/Store.js#L110-L113
2013-09-18T13:15:28 * jhernandez joined the channel
2013-09-18T13:15:42 <Justin_o> amilchev: you should probably maintain that external api.. so you can expect that someone calling your invoker will only be passing in the settings\xe2\x80\xa6 any other arguments you\'ll likely need to be setting in your invoker setup and sourcing from somewhere else
2013-09-18T13:15:53 <Justin_o> as per the example i just pasted

2013-09-18T13:28:34 <amilchev> Justin_o: not sure what you tried to explain here.. if it is what "args" does with invokers, I know that ..
2013-09-18T13:29:02 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. basically that..
2013-09-18T13:30:29 <amilchev> Justin_o: I actually asked what should the two functions do, rather than how they would be called
2013-09-18T13:31:21 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-09-18T13:32:52 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay\xe2\x80\xa6 at a high level one sets which you can think of as save, and the other gets the values from the store.. at a lower level this will be highly dependent on where you are setting to and getting from.. cindyli is starting on some code to work with the GPII preference server, perhaps she could share that with you to give you some ideas
2013-09-18T13:33:31 <amilchev> Justin_o: evgeni talked about something like https://github.com/tsakov/universal/blob/node-webkit/gpii/node_modules/personalControlPanel/src/content/deps/GPIIStore.js#L50-L56
2013-09-18T13:35:13 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-09-18T13:35:45 <Justin_o> amilchev: having these things refer to http requests makes sense.. although i can\'t really comment on the URL structure/api needed for that
2013-09-18T13:36:31 <cindyli> amilchev: the code I\'m writing to get / set prefs from gpii server: https://github.com/cindyli/prefsEditors/compare/GPII-185
2013-09-18T13:39:46 <cindyli> let me know if you have questions

2013-09-18T13:45:33 <amilchev> cindyli: thanks, that looks helpful, let me start writing my own and see where questions will pop out
2013-09-18T13:45:47 <cindyli> sure, amilchev

2013-09-18T14:24:26 <amilchev> cindyli: I see you define urlToGet and urlToSave inside the component and reference them by passing {that}.options as an argument - my question is:
2013-09-18T14:24:26 <amilchev> what are the URLs for my GET and POST requests? Perhaps they depend on the token (for instance if user sammy is logged in, the url should be sth like .../sammy/update)?
2013-09-18T14:26:33 <cindyli> amilchev: yes, it depends on the token. as i understand, with gpii, the url would always be \xe2\x80\xa6/sammy while "sammy" is the user token. there\'s no such thing as /sammy/update
2013-09-18T14:27:41 <cindyli> Sending a GET request to the token url is to retrieve prefs while sending a POST request is to update
2013-09-18T14:28:59 <amilchev> cindyli: oh, as far as "update" goes, I guess I keep being confused by the file Evgeni sent me https://github.com/tsakov/universal/blob/node-webkit/gpii/node_modules/personalControlPanel/src/content/deps/GPIIStore.js#L52
2013-09-18T14:29:01 <cindyli> my script has 2 urls for setting and getting is only for testing purpose, in case we\'d like to retrieve data from an actual user but not willing to update its data, in which case the save url can point to a test token
2013-09-18T14:29:49 <cindyli> ah ha, i\'m confused by that line too :) could it be pcp specific?
2013-09-18T14:30:51 <amilchev> cindyli: I\'m not sure, Evgeni told me to send the POST request to .../update
2013-09-18T14:31:51 <cindyli> amilchev: we are talking about updating gpii prefs data, right? yzen might know better.
2013-09-18T14:32:26 <yzen> amilchev: cindyli as far as i know the /update API is only defined in his branch
2013-09-18T14:32:45 <cindyli> ah ok
2013-09-18T14:34:10 <cindyli> seems depending on which branch your gpii server is built from, amilchev
2013-09-18T14:35:15 <amilchev> cindyli: yzen: so the URL for the POST request should be localhost:8081/user/<<token>>/update
2013-09-18T14:35:28 <yzen> i think so yes
2013-09-18T14:35:52 <amilchev> ok
2013-09-18T14:53:29 <Justin_o> michelled: i fixed the commit log for my GPII-202 pull request and showed the interaction to vjoanna. You can find the new pull request at https://github.com/fluid-project/prefsEditors/pull/48

2013-09-18T15:12:27 <avtar> yzen: cindyli, Justin_o, and i were taking a look at switching dev environments for the preferences server over to production
2013-09-18T15:13:06 <yzen> it is isn\'t it ?
2013-09-18T15:14:06 <avtar> i searched around on the gpii wiki but i couldn\'t find instructions that users can follow to modify the test preferences https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/preferences so that they can be imported into couchdb
2013-09-18T15:15:12 <avtar> is there a reason why the test preferences aren\'t formatted already to accommodate the couchdb api?
2013-09-18T15:17:22 <yzen> avtar: as far as i know preferences.gpii.net runs with couch
2013-09-18T15:17:30 <yzen> and you can add modify preferences sets
