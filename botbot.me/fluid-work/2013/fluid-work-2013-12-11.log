b'2013-12-11T16:30:02 <cindyli> or just green and grey?
2013-12-11T16:31:35 <jhung> I think green only if "Yes Audio" is present, grey for all others.
2013-12-11T16:35:26 <cindyli> ok, jhung
2013-12-11T16:35:57 <jhung> ^danaayotte_ you agree?
2013-12-11T16:37:59 <danaayotte_> +1
2013-12-11T16:38:56 <avtar> michelled: i believe yzen has a shell script that he uses for provisioning a vanilla fedora vm
2013-12-11T16:39:17 <yzen> avtar: michelled it\'s yet untested
2013-12-11T16:40:01 <avtar> if you guys can wait i\'m going to spend some time today to automate the provisioning process using this new vm
2013-12-11T16:40:37 <avtar> kasparnet might be into that as well

2013-12-11T17:42:41 <Justin_o> jhung: can put the Chinese language as Mandarin instead?
2013-12-11T17:46:09 <jhung> Justin_o: For captions it doesn\'t make sense to call it Mandarin since the written language is the same for multiple languages, not just Mandarin.
2013-12-11T17:47:22 <Justin_o> jhung: Can we call it Chinese simplified then :)
2013-12-11T17:53:24 * anastasiac joined the channel
2013-12-11T17:59:37 <jhung> Actually Justin_o, it\'s just "Chinese". Check this BCP-47 table: http://rishida.net/utils/subtags/index.php?lookup=zh&submit=Look+up
2013-12-11T18:00:47 <Justin_o> jhung: i see zh (Chinese) is generic "zh is a macrolanguage that encompasses the following more specific primary language subtags: cdo cjy cmn cpx czh czo gan hak hsn lzh mnp nan wuu yue. If it doesn\'t break legacy usage for your application, you should use one of these more specific language subtags instead. On the other hand, zh is often preferred by
2013-12-11T18:00:47 <Justin_o> legacy applications rather than cmn (Mandarin Chinese)."
2013-12-11T18:01:32 <jhung> Well, "zh" is fine because it\'s written language, not spoken. So zh as a caption is fine since we\'re using it in a macro case.
2013-12-11T18:01:50 <jhung> Does that make sense?
2013-12-11T18:02:06 <Justin_o> sure that\'s fine
2013-12-11T18:03:18 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-12-11T18:03:21 <jhung> When we start dealing with Audio Descriptions, we\'ll need this differentiation since cmn and cjy chinese are spoken differently, even if the captions / writing are the same.
2013-12-11T18:08:40 <Justin_o> jhung: although there is a difference between simplified and traditional characters for writing too

2013-12-11T21:07:02 <Justin_o> i\'ve pushed up my changes so far, but it\'s really still at the start. I suppose the subcomponent used to create each individual caption input should be done, but the tests need to be written to verify this.

2013-12-11T22:03:55 <yzen> that\'s what i was doing
2013-12-11T22:04:27 <avtar> just wanted to confirm as i work through what\'s documented here http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment
2013-12-11T22:04:36 <avtar> the instructions seem a bit misleading

2013-12-11T22:13:26 <avtar> should i only use 0.2?
2013-12-11T22:13:41 <michelled> no, use master
2013-12-11T22:13:47 <michelled> it\'s really what 0.2 will be
2013-12-11T22:13:56 <michelled> I think the 0.2 branch is misleading in general :(

2013-12-11T13:54:17 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I\'ve posted a fix for FLUID-5239
2013-12-11T13:54:30 <Bosmon> Have you had a chance to look at FLUID-4890 some more, in the context of our preferences UI?
2013-12-11T13:54:34 * mrvisser_ has quit
2013-12-11T13:54:49 <Bosmon> I am beginning to suspect that this is the real reason that we see intermittent test failures on those particular tests btw
2013-12-11T13:55:07 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if you\'ve noticed it... but sometimes on running a full panel of framework tests, some of the preferences ones will spontaneously fail
2013-12-11T13:55:14 <Bosmon> But then run correctly when run individually

2013-12-11T14:14:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting that FLUID-5239 was a regexp issue.. so i take it that before anything starting with arguments, options, container, source, and change wouldn\'t have worked

2013-12-11T14:37:20 <amilchev> hi Justin_o, here\'s a quickie: in the protoTree of a panel, when setting the messageBundles by    someSelector: {messagekey: "key_in_JSON"},      can I load different messagekey according to a model value state? For instance, I want the messagekey of more/less to be determined by a model value (which says if the extra stuff is expanded or not).
2013-12-11T14:39:01 <amilchev> Justin_o: I\'m wondering this because when clicking "Save" and the expanded part is visible (=> the label says "less"), I guess the refreshView() of Save reloads the messageBundles according to the messagekey in the protoTree (or is it sth else?)
2013-12-11T14:39:32 <Justin_o> amilchev: so you want to use a different key based on the model value?
2013-12-11T14:39:39 <amilchev> Justin_o: exactly
2013-12-11T14:40:19 <amilchev> Justin_o: or in other way make the text for more/less remain "less" after the user clicks "save and apply"
2013-12-11T14:40:29 <Justin_o> amilchev: I think what you want is to use a conditional expander.. this will give you two different tree paths.. for true and false conditions which would be based off of the model value..
2013-12-11T14:41:10 <Justin_o> amilchev: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Renderer+Component+Tree+Expanders#RendererComponentTreeExpanders-ConditionExpander
2013-12-11T14:41:39 <Justin_o> so you would have a different messagekey for the trueTree and falseTree
2013-12-11T14:42:01 <Justin_o> amilchev: you might also want to check in with chris about this. I think he\'s worked on some similar functionality
2013-12-11T14:42:47 <amilchev> Justin_o: that sounds cool! thanks for now, if anything else, I\'ll ping you again
2013-12-11T14:42:59 <Justin_o> amilchev: sounds good, thanks
2013-12-11T14:52:40 <amilchev> Justin_o:
2013-12-11T14:52:40 <amilchev> protoTree: {
2013-12-11T14:52:40 <amilchev> moreLess: "${moreLess}",

2013-12-11T14:52:44 <amilchev> }
2013-12-11T14:52:44 <amilchev> }
2013-12-11T14:53:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: this throws "that is not defined". If I write it in quotes "that. ... " - evaluates the string as true and always uses the trueTree
2013-12-11T14:54:06 <amilchev> Justin_o: seems that I\'m only passing the condition wrongly :?
2013-12-11T14:57:28 <amilchev> Justin_o: why does "${that}. ..." always evaluate to false then?
2013-12-11T14:58:53 <Justin_o> amilchev: try "${{that}...}"

2013-12-11T15:02:26 <amilchev> yeah, that totally worked :)
2013-12-11T15:03:15 <amilchev> Justin_o: thanks, ${{that}..} worked, I actually had forgotten that I\'m inside the small panel, so the model value is just moreLess, but not gpii_primary... :)
2013-12-11T15:03:21 * danaayotte_ joined the channel
2013-12-11T15:04:06 <Justin_o> ah.. that would explain the falsey return value
2013-12-11T15:05:47 <amilchev> Justin_o: only partially - "${that}.model.moreLess" always returns false, whether "${{that}.model.moreLess}" does exactly what I want
2013-12-11T15:06:20 <amilchev> don\'t ask me for reason
2013-12-11T15:06:24 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. in renderer trees you need to use the extra "{}" bracing
2013-12-11T15:08:22 <amilchev> Justin_o: ok, I\'ve got that fixed as far as the text goest. But I\'m blocked about the icon - it\'s different arrows (pointing up and down respectively for \'less\' and \'more\'). In the html markup I\'m using the class for the down arrow
2013-12-11T15:09:01 <Justin_o> amilchev: should be a similar solution. You can use a renderer decorator to add classes.. so you would add different classes to each condtion
2013-12-11T15:09:30 <Justin_o> amilchev: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Renderer+Decorators#RendererDecorators-addClassdecorator
2013-12-11T15:09:38 <amilchev> Justin_o: oh, I actually glimpsed an example with "addClass" in the wiki
2013-12-11T15:10:47 <amilchev> Justin_o: that should do the work! thanks for now
2013-12-11T15:10:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: np
2013-12-11T15:12:38 <Justin_o> amilchev: by the way, I\'ll be away on Thursday and Friday.. if you have questions, or are ready for code reviews during those days, you can check in with cindyli
2013-12-11T15:14:24 <amilchev> Justin_o: Boyan informed me about that, but thanks for reminding anyway
2013-12-11T15:17:38 <Justin_o> ah good.. just wanted to make sure you knew..
2013-12-11T15:21:32 <jhung> Justin_o: FYI I\'ve pushed up changes to my branch.
2013-12-11T15:22:25 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. are they all ready to go?
2013-12-11T15:22:40 <jhung> Justin_o: not quite. But you can use it for now.
2013-12-11T15:23:10 <jhung> I need to tidy up a bit and add a container inside the SimpleEditor for the panels.
2013-12-11T15:23:20 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. i\'ll take a look
2013-12-11T15:26:37 <jhung> Justin_o, I was going to add a the metadata panel container (a div probably) to the flc-simpleEditor container. I suspect this may be an issue?
2013-12-11T15:27:00 <Justin_o> jhung: not sure i\'m following
2013-12-11T15:27:40 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m guessing you mean the sidebar.. as long as it\'s not inside of the contents container of the editor.. it should be fine
2013-12-11T15:28:45 <Justin_o> jhung: the styling looks good.. are you going to restyle the markupViewer page too?
2013-12-11T15:28:45 <jhung> Uhhh\xe2\x80\xa6 it might be a problem. There\'s a container: <div class="flc-simpleEditor-content fl-simpleEditor-content panel-body"></div>. I was thinking of putting a container inside of that.
2013-12-11T15:29:43 <jhung> Justin_o: yup. I\'ll do that once I have the metadata panel container in.
2013-12-11T15:30:07 <Justin_o> jhung: that would be a problem, but you can instead add another div around that which would take the panel-body class, and then make the new div a sibling of the flc-simpleEditor-content one
2013-12-11T15:30:10 <Justin_o> would that work?
2013-12-11T15:32:08 <jhung> Justin_o: I think so. I will probably need to restructure the markup a bit so it visually matches the design.
2013-12-11T15:37:53 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2013-12-11T15:45:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: can FLOE-117 be closed now?
2013-12-11T15:46:01 <cindyli> Justin_o: yes

2013-12-11T16:03:04 <jhung> still need to think about it.
2013-12-11T16:03:09 <Justin_o> jhung: okay for now I won\'t provide that option to the captions panel

2013-12-11T16:18:31 <cindyli> jhung, danaayotte_: just double check the colour of the icon in the audio metadata panel. it doesn\'t respond to the selection of whether this video has audio track and the colour should always be green, right?
2013-12-11T16:19:44 <cindyli> personally feel a bit weird that the icon is still green when no audio track for this video.
2013-12-11T16:19:55 <jhung> cindyli: interesting\xe2\x80\xa6
2013-12-11T16:20:35 <jhung> cindyli: I was thinking the icon would always be green.
2013-12-11T16:21:18 <jhung> to me, the green indicates you have selected an option - so even if you selected "No Audio", it\'s still an option. danaayotte_ what are your thoughts?

2013-12-11T16:24:47 <michelled> thanks for the nightly build avtar!
2013-12-11T16:25:05 <michelled> now jhung and danaayotte_ can see what the devs have been up to :)
2013-12-11T16:25:25 <danaayotte_> jhung cindyli: good question  and I see what you mean Jon.  But I think it would be best if the icon were not green if there is no audio.  Part of the problem in the demo is that we no star/recommend system.  Ultimately it would be grey but with no star.
2013-12-11T16:25:44 <avtar> michelled :)
2013-12-11T16:26:25 <danaayotte_> Does that make sense to yous jhung cindyli?

2013-12-11T16:26:29 <avtar> in case you want to build your own fedora 19 vm
2013-12-11T16:26:38 <michelled> YAY!!!!
2013-12-11T16:26:52 <danaayotte_> thanks michelled!
2013-12-11T16:27:14 <michelled> :)
2013-12-11T16:27:34 <jhung> danaayotte_, cindyli: makes sense. Then I\'m okay with turning it grey if No Audio is chosen.
2013-12-11T16:27:46 <jhung> Thanks avtar for the nightly build!
2013-12-11T16:27:51 <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhung and danaayotte_
2013-12-11T16:29:57 <cindyli> danaayotte_ and jhung, audio attribute has 3 states: available, unavailable and unknown. do you wanna have 3 icon colours for 3 states?
