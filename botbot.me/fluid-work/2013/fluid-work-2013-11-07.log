b'2013-11-07T16:20:15 <Bosmon7> Other than these 3 issues I think the pull looks fine
2013-11-07T16:20:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: in the case of the sub panels i would expect the defaults to be valid, but i think it would be better if they were merged
2013-11-07T16:20:51 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2013-11-07T16:22:05 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - ok, I see the issue, you are inspecting the nested options set "ahead of time" ....
2013-11-07T16:22:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes.. exactly
2013-11-07T16:22:35 <Bosmon7> Ok
2013-11-07T16:23:03 <Bosmon7> In that case you should make a better attempt to simulate the real action of the framework at this point, although it will actually be quite hard to be completely accurate
2013-11-07T16:23:33 <Bosmon7> Since in addition to the options you can see, you could expect to have to account for the effects of any "distributeOptions" blocks which may have been elsewhere in the tree
2013-11-07T16:23:42 <Bosmon7> And, were they still existing, any demands blocks : P
2013-11-07T16:23:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :(
2013-11-07T16:24:21 <Justin_o> it would be easier if i was working with the actual component instance, but in case of the isPanel function, i\'m not sure i can
2013-11-07T16:24:42 <Justin_o> there are some cases that have to run before hand.. at time of gradeMerging
2013-11-07T16:25:55 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - as a first pass, I suggest you make a utility function which strings together the action of i) fluid.getGradedDefaults, ii) fluid.merge
2013-11-07T16:26:04 <Bosmon7> That should be "faithful" enough to be good for now
2013-11-07T16:26:51 <Bosmon7> You can supply the typeName and any gradeNames in the subcomponent record to fluid.getGradedDefaults to get a more accurate default
2013-11-07T16:27:06 <Bosmon7> And then merge that with the subcomponent\'s actual options using the mergePolicy that you can find in it
2013-11-07T16:27:16 <Bosmon7> Although this will still be inaccurate in a few important ways
2013-11-07T16:27:34 <Bosmon7> It would be better in the long term if you could think of a way of doing this "as the component instantiates" rather than ahead of time
2013-11-07T16:30:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'ll investigate where i can make use of actual components instead, the only spot where I know that won\'t work is for things that are used to generate dynamic grades. At the moment that is in the fluid.prefs.compositePanel.assembleDistributeOptions function. There\'s another one coming in my FLUID-5205 branch as well.
2013-11-07T16:31:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: switching to use live components will also have the other issue of needing to rerun these functions when FLUID-5205 lands because of it\'s support for creating and destroying subpanels
2013-11-07T16:32:31 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - couldn\'t the generation of the dynamic grades also be done "live", by means of a contextualised invoker?
2013-11-07T16:33:00 <Justin_o> hmm.. what does that mean
2013-11-07T16:33:59 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I mean, a gradeName which holds the name of an invoker
2013-11-07T16:34:10 <Bosmon7> An actually "dynamic grade"
2013-11-07T16:35:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m not sure i follow..
2013-11-07T16:35:43 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - a gradeName which has the form of something like {that}.anInvoker
2013-11-07T16:36:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i think we had problems before when trying to add invokers with a dynamic grade because the invokers block is resolved ahead of time to facilitate calling it in the dynamic grade
2013-11-07T16:36:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: well i do have that
2013-11-07T16:36:21 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I\'m sorry, yes, I had been hoping to revisit that issue today
2013-11-07T16:36:30 <Bosmon7> Since I thought that it might have been fixed by some other recent work
2013-11-07T16:36:36 <Justin_o> oh
2013-11-07T16:36:36 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately I think I have run out of time for now
2013-11-07T16:36:46 <Justin_o> :(
2013-11-07T16:36:54 <Justin_o> that\'s too bad.. when do you think you\'ll be back
2013-11-07T16:37:14 <Bosmon7> I might reappear for a bit on Monday
2013-11-07T16:38:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. hope you have a good weekend.. do you think if i can address the issues you\'ve mentioned now that michelled could push it in?
2013-11-07T16:38:32 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes
2013-11-07T16:39:06 <Bosmon7> If you can replace those sites where you make a raw call to the defaults, with, in both locations, a call to a common utility function which makes a better attempt at options merging, that will be fine

2013-11-07T21:47:06 <sgithens> what did you have to write a bash function for?
2013-11-07T21:47:06 <colinclark> It\'s really, really exciting
2013-11-07T21:47:13 <sgithens> :)

2013-11-07T21:48:39 <sgithens> awesome!
2013-11-07T21:50:05 <colinclark> I\'ll make a pull request shortly

2013-11-07T13:40:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello.. i\'ve been wondering how namespacing works with modelListeners
2013-11-07T13:40:59 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I imagine that it will fail with the current implementation
2013-11-07T13:43:16 <Bosmon7> In general I advise you not to depend on it until the new ChangeApplier is implemented
2013-11-07T13:43:28 <Bosmon7> It\'s possible that if you tried it now you might get some results
2013-11-07T13:43:33 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-11-07T13:43:37 <Bosmon7> It would help if you could describe your use case
2013-11-07T13:43:45 <Bosmon7> Gosh, doesn\'t everyone get into work early : P
2013-11-07T13:44:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: will you start coming in early now too :)
2013-11-07T13:45:09 <Bosmon7> Not for much longer
2013-11-07T13:45:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :( i\'ll try to take advantage while i can then
2013-11-07T13:46:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so i\'m using the modelListeners for my composite panel work, for the creation of of sub panels based on model values
2013-11-07T13:47:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: you can see it here https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5205/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L310-L314
2013-11-07T13:47:34 <Justin_o> currently i\'m just stuffing them into an array
2013-11-07T13:48:00 <Justin_o> i still have to write unit tests for this.. so for now i\'m only assuming that this actually works
2013-11-07T13:48:51 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - you have the wrong syntax
2013-11-07T13:48:58 <Bosmon7> ModelListeners is a hash whose key is the model path
2013-11-07T13:48:59 <Bosmon7> Not an array
2013-11-07T13:49:34 <Bosmon7> I guess you meant to write modelListeners[pref] on that highlighted line
2013-11-07T13:49:40 <Bosmon7> Anyway, what use do you have for the namespace?
2013-11-07T13:50:03 <Justin_o> ah yes.. thanks for spotting that..
2013-11-07T13:50:40 <Justin_o> then i could assign these to unique namespaces instead of the array... i suppose for this case it doesn\'t really matter.. as i doubt we\'d want them to be deleted or overridden
2013-11-07T13:51:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: but i was curious about it when looking at the modelListeners.. also what does gaurdSource do?
2013-11-07T13:51:38 <Bosmon7> It was actually hard for me to think of a clear use case for selectively overriding model listeners
2013-11-07T13:51:45 <Bosmon7> Especially given that they are all listening to variously different paths
2013-11-07T13:52:09 <Bosmon7> I thought we needed this functionality carried over from conventional listeners, but I managed to convince myself in the new implementation that we probably don\'t
2013-11-07T13:52:24 <Bosmon7> The path "guardSource" allows you to prevent a listener triggering for a change with a particular "source"
2013-11-07T13:52:38 <Bosmon7> You can ask cindyli about this since she has experience of the old utilities with the videoPlayer : P
2013-11-07T13:53:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay... so i probably won\'t need to worry about it and if i run into something i\'ll check with cindyli
2013-11-07T13:53:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: any comments on my general approach for FLUID-5205
2013-11-07T13:55:21 <Justin_o> I think these are the changes specific to FLUID-5205 https://github.com/jobara/infusion/compare/FLUID-5200...FLUID-5205
2013-11-07T13:55:25 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - thanks
2013-11-07T13:55:47 <Justin_o> i\'m probably going to remove the custom refreshView, i don\'t think i\'ll need the extra event anymore
2013-11-07T13:55:49 * amilchev has left the channel
2013-11-07T13:56:13 * sgithens has quit
2013-11-07T13:56:37 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - the name "fluid.prefs.compositePanel.subPanelCreationTiming" seems misleading
2013-11-07T13:56:46 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-11-07T13:56:49 <Bosmon7> It doesn\'t seem to really return anything related to timing : P
2013-11-07T13:57:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: it sets the createOnEvent properties
2013-11-07T13:57:25 <Bosmon7> And also the general approach seems a bit wobbly, in that it seems odd to render parts of panels and then only hide them later if you find they are "inactive"
2013-11-07T13:57:46 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it seems to do a good deal more than that
2013-11-07T13:58:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m not sure of a way around that.. see the template for the composite panel has the containers for the sub panels to render into.. we don\'t want those to show up if the panels themselves aren\'t rendered
2013-11-07T13:59:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: and at the same time they need to be present when the component is created (but not rendered) since the sub panels require the dom container for initialization
2013-11-07T13:59:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: also any recommendations for a more suitable name
2013-11-07T13:59:50 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - well, what does it do :)
2013-11-07T14:01:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: it adds the events that will be used to for the createOnEvent, adds the createOnEvent properties, binds modelListener events and handles these as well as afterRender and onCreate for knowing when to trigger the create event or destroy the component
2013-11-07T14:01:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: it really does quite a bit
2013-11-07T14:01:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: maybe something like subPanelLifeCycleBindings
2013-11-07T14:02:06 <Bosmon7> Sounds reasonable
2013-11-07T14:07:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. thanks.. i\'ll change that.. going back to the other issue with the hiding of the containers.. do you have more thoughts on that?
2013-11-07T14:07:43 <Justin_o> or anything else for that matter
2013-11-07T14:09:06 <Bosmon7> The approach looks broadly reasonable
2013-11-07T14:09:16 <Bosmon7> Some commenting wouldn\'t go amiss, since this logic is fairly intricate
2013-11-07T14:10:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. that also makes sense.. thanks
2013-11-07T14:31:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: made some changes based on your feedback https://github.com/jobara/infusion/compare/FLUID-5200...FLUID-5205

2013-11-07T14:43:40 <yzen> Bosmon7: hi
2013-11-07T14:43:59 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately it looks like I can\'t resolve FLUID-5208 after all :(
2013-11-07T14:44:05 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-11-07T14:44:06 <yzen> oh noes
2013-11-07T14:44:13 <Bosmon7> I\'m not sure what the reason was that I thought I couldn\'t do it before
2013-11-07T14:44:22 <Bosmon7> But certainly there are now new reasons why I can\'t do it : P
2013-11-07T14:44:36 <yzen> right
2013-11-07T14:44:42 <Bosmon7> There\'s just too much special-case processing for the "listeners" block now that implies it must be directly visible under the correct name
2013-11-07T14:44:42 <yzen> i found another bug that i will file
2013-11-07T14:44:47 <yzen> re dynamic grades
2013-11-07T14:45:05 <Bosmon7> For example we now have "expandCompact" as well as "annotateListeners"
2013-11-07T14:45:10 <yzen> if i refer to {arguments} in members the do not get expanded
2013-11-07T14:45:31 <Bosmon7> And so if the "listeners" block just consists of an IoC reference, its contents would "sneak in under the covers" without being pre-processed properly
2013-11-07T14:45:53 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately I got 90% of the way through the implementation work before discovering that it was impossible : P
2013-11-07T14:46:04 <yzen> ok
2013-11-07T14:46:13 <Bosmon7> yzen - what would you like "arguments" to evaluate to?
2013-11-07T14:46:27 <yzen> well no what i mean is that they just done get expanded
2013-11-07T14:46:31 <yzen> in dynamic grades
2013-11-07T14:46:45 <Bosmon7> ok
2013-11-07T14:46:47 <yzen> if i mention them in members block
2013-11-07T14:47:32 <Bosmon7> Do you mean in expanders?
2013-11-07T14:47:38 <Bosmon7> That is, in expanders in the members block
2013-11-07T14:47:57 <yzen> no
2013-11-07T14:48:13 <Bosmon7> Ok, if they are not in an expander, what should the value of "arguments" be?

2013-11-07T15:23:24 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli, I think the composite panels documentation page is ready to share, but I believe that there are still outstanding branches that would need to be merged before master actually works properly with composite panels, is that correct? And if so, should I hold off on letting the architecture list know about the composite panels until master is updated?

2013-11-07T15:46:22 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the fixes for those bugs you\'ve found haven\'t gone in yet..
2013-11-07T15:46:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: perhaps we should wait for those
2013-11-07T15:47:01 <anastasiac> ok, Justin_o, that\'s what I suspected
2013-11-07T15:47:02 <anastasiac> thanks

2013-11-07T16:09:19 <yzen> Bosmon7:
2013-11-07T16:09:28 <Bosmon7> How is your "arguments" issue?
2013-11-07T16:10:13 <michelled> Bosmon7: we need to push Justin_o and cindyli\'s 5200 branch
2013-11-07T16:10:22 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/432
2013-11-07T16:10:28 <michelled> he was just about to take me through all the details of the fixes that they\'ve done
2013-11-07T16:10:30 <Bosmon7> michelled - I\'d like to get some clarity on that
2013-11-07T16:10:41 <michelled> what were you wondering Bosmon7?
2013-11-07T16:10:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, michelled: we also need this one in after that https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/431
2013-11-07T16:11:02 <Bosmon7> michelled - just what other commits it depends on in and in what order
2013-11-07T16:11:16 <Bosmon7> I think Justin_o had mentioned there was an interdependence between that and cindyli\'s textfieldSlider work
2013-11-07T16:11:38 <yzen> Bosmon7: ill make a JIRA and describe my case with an example
2013-11-07T16:11:42 <yzen> it will be more obvious
2013-11-07T16:11:54 <Bosmon7> yzen - thanks!
2013-11-07T16:11:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: my understanding is that https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/431 is dependent on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/432
2013-11-07T16:14:57 <Bosmon7> I guess I\'m hesitant to comment too much on something which is so urgent, especially if it is working
2013-11-07T16:15:11 <Bosmon7> But I wonder if you could explain the use of the component defaults at line 286
2013-11-07T16:15:21 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/432/files#diff-4ea13c1c02992def09fa53326d6d5de8R286
2013-11-07T16:15:47 <Bosmon7> This seems in principle dodgy and I am wondering why it is not sufficient to inspect the options which are actually there?
2013-11-07T16:17:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'ll try to remember if there was a specific reason
2013-11-07T16:18:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the options there are the supplied options as opposed to the components default options.
2013-11-07T16:19:42 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - is it not likely that the actually present options are more relevant than the defaults?
2013-11-07T16:19:57 <Bosmon7> It seems that going for the defaults is liable to cause "unexpected effects" for the integrator
2013-11-07T16:19:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i suppose they are both relevant
2013-11-07T16:20:08 <Bosmon7> I have commented the other place where you have used defaults too
