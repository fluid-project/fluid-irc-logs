b'2013-09-23T19:00:48 <Bosmon> I am now working at the next level of insanity - which is assimmillating the MODEL RELAY system
2013-09-23T19:01:00 <Bosmon> For which cindyli\'s implementation in UIO is a helpful guide
2013-09-23T19:01:39 <Bosmon> Unfortunately this will create a huge amount of disruption since it involves going back on an assumption we made almost on day 1 in Fluid... that the "model" reference of a component is stable
2013-09-23T19:02:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i was talking with cindyli  a bit about the template combining stuff.. so the integrator will need to supply a template template which defines how all the templates for the sub panels are arranged.. as well as anything else that needs to be rendered for the parent panel.. the question for me is how to get those other templates into this.. i could just dump the resourceText into a jQuery and use that to insert the other pieces at
2013-09-23T19:02:07 <Bosmon> My plan is to create a new base grade, "modelRelayComponent" that has the new semantic, and we will have to vet all of our components in Fluid 1 by 1 to make them ready for the new model
2013-09-23T19:02:07 <Justin_o> the proper locations and get the html back out to put in the resourceText field.. or perhaps there is a better way.
2013-09-23T19:02:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it would be very helpful to avoid round-tripping the template through the document
2013-09-23T19:02:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sounds interesting.. is this going to be a 2.0 thing then
2013-09-23T19:02:42 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-23T19:02:53 <Bosmon> There is still a "back door" in RendererComponent that accepts a "function returning some text" in the role of a template
2013-09-23T19:03:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting.. how does that work?
2013-09-23T19:03:18 <Bosmon> So I suggest you try to use this to see if it is good enough for you
2013-09-23T19:04:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the option "templateSource"
2013-09-23T19:04:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: anyways.. i didn\'t mean to put it in the DOM exactly just to wrap the text in a jQuery.. like $("<div>\xe2\x80\xa6</div>)
2013-09-23T19:04:37 <Bosmon> You might notice the following very dubious section in RendererUtilities.js
2013-09-23T19:04:38 <Bosmon> if (typeof(source) === "function") { // TODO: make a better attempt than this at asynchrony
2013-09-23T19:04:39 <Bosmon> source = source();
2013-09-23T19:04:39 <Bosmon> }
2013-09-23T19:04:45 <Bosmon> About line 102
2013-09-23T19:04:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that will still unavoidably create DOM material for the template
2013-09-23T19:05:05 <Bosmon> Even if it isn\'t put into the document\'s DOM
2013-09-23T19:05:16 <Bosmon> You should really make sure you manipulate the templates as text until the final moment
2013-09-23T19:05:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. looking at your code above.. i remember that spot now
2013-09-23T19:05:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'ll have to do some string operations to combine the templates together from the various resourceText fields
2013-09-23T19:05:49 <Bosmon> Given you are generating your own grade, to be honest, I\'m not sure that this will be helpful
2013-09-23T19:05:52 <Justin_o> does that sound about right?
2013-09-23T19:05:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s correct
2013-09-23T19:06:20 <Bosmon> Unfortunately as the comment suggests, the implementation there doesn\'t really help you with the asynchrony angle
2013-09-23T19:06:40 <Bosmon> You will still need to make sure that "somehow this has already been achieved" before the time anyone calls the "render" function
2013-09-23T19:07:02 <Bosmon> And given you have achieved it, the fact that you can call a function to return the result doesn\'t really help you very much with the important problem : P
2013-09-23T19:07:35 <Bosmon> So you may as well just stick the whole template itself into templateSource after all
2013-09-23T19:08:01 <Bosmon> Until we have the "asynchronous ginger world", this kind of problem is going to keep recurring
2013-09-23T19:18:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. so i\'ll do that.. i\'ll just rewrite the resourceText for the template to include the sub panels templates as well
2013-09-23T19:19:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool!
2013-09-23T19:19:02 <Bosmon> Should be interesting
2013-09-23T19:19:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: at the moment none of the panels are able to fetch there own templates anyways.. so this should be right in line with that :)
2013-09-23T19:19:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-09-23T19:19:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully.. we\'ll see how my string hacking skills go
2013-09-23T19:19:41 <Bosmon> In theory you might use the renderer itself for this task
2013-09-23T19:20:17 <Bosmon> Thankfully since we abolished the "rsf:id" system there is now no longer a difference in form between a renderer template and its rendered result
2013-09-23T19:20:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting are there public functions i can borrow for that.. or will i need to make a call to the renderer itself and get it dump out the text
2013-09-23T19:20:34 <Bosmon> And so fewer obstacles to creating a "renderer template-renderer"
2013-09-23T19:20:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - In theory all you would need is a use of the "UIVerbatim" component type
2013-09-23T19:21:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: which would return the markup to me as a string right?
2013-09-23T19:21:25 <Bosmon> This has a member named "markup" holding the already-rendered markup
2013-09-23T19:21:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the other way round
2013-09-23T19:21:36 <Bosmon> You SUPPLY the markup as a string
2013-09-23T19:22:02 <Bosmon> But the overall renderer action returns the markup as a string too, yes
2013-09-23T19:22:38 <Bosmon> But you would do this as a "private" invocation of the renderer, rather than through using RendererComponent which isn\'t set up to put the markup anywhere but in the DOM
2013-09-23T19:23:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i could just make a call to fluid.renderer itself?
2013-09-23T19:23:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-09-23T19:24:17 <Bosmon> On the other hand, you may decide that this is too much trouble, and just operate a giant instance of fluid.stringTemplate instead : P
2013-09-23T19:25:00 <Bosmon> I guess this would still require you to somehow "parse" the outer template and then discover where all the "holes" are
2013-09-23T19:25:08 <Bosmon> And so is not really advisable
2013-09-23T19:26:12 <Bosmon> All the same, the kind of component tree you\'ll need to make this work will be something we have not seen for many moons
2013-09-23T19:26:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess the integrator could supply a markup block in the options that contains the string template tokens which would correspond to templates, but i\'ll try to use the renderer first
2013-09-23T19:26:40 <Bosmon> Something involving both UIJointContainer and UIVerbatim
2013-09-23T19:26:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: time to dig through the docs i guess :)
2013-09-23T19:27:03 <Bosmon> The member "jointID" in a component is what signals to the renderer to make a jump from one template to another
2013-09-23T19:27:51 <Bosmon> So the component tree for this rendering involves i) 1 UIJointContainer, with ii) a UIVerbatim inside it, for every subtemplate
2013-09-23T19:29:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the only usage I can find of jointID in the whole image is in the manual tests
2013-09-23T19:29:40 <Bosmon> "renderer-component-types.html"
2013-09-23T19:29:53 <Bosmon> I guess we have anastasiac to thank for this, since without this we would have no examples at all : P
2013-09-23T19:30:19 <Bosmon> Ironic that 5 years had to elapse before we had a use case for this
2013-09-23T19:30:29 <Bosmon> When we were just on the point of abolishing the renderer anyway
2013-09-23T19:31:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that is funny actually, you were very forward thinking
2013-09-23T19:31:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess these are the docs http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion13/Renderer+Component+Types
2013-09-23T19:31:24 <Justin_o> and i\'ll take a look at that example
2013-09-23T19:32:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - actually in the "RSF Renderer" from which this was taken, this component was much more frequently used
2013-09-23T19:32:49 <Bosmon> Since the system typically had to create the entire markup for a page in one pass on the server ...
2013-09-23T19:33:15 <Bosmon> Given we never yet sorted out our infrastructure on the client for allowing one rendererComponent to be nested inside another, this component was hugely less useful
2013-09-23T19:33:40 <Bosmon> But given you are now mocking up this infrastructure yourself with your "grade-combining grade", the use case for UIJointContainer reappears ahead of time
2013-09-23T19:33:51 <Bosmon> But thankfully the "new renderer" will be free of such monstrosities
2013-09-23T19:34:53 <Bosmon> The "joint" infrastructure will be moved inside the IoC system itself where the user won\'t be constantly stubbing their toe on it
2013-09-23T19:35:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) looking forward to the new system.. i guess it\'s a ways off, but things in general keep getting better everyday
2013-09-23T19:36:35 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-09-23T19:36:50 <Bosmon> We should have a meeting about the "new model infrastructure" soon, since it will involve big changes for all of us
2013-09-23T19:37:29 <Bosmon> The central issue is that model references will no longer be shared i) between different components, and ii) between the users of components and the components
2013-09-23T19:38:28 <Bosmon> And it will become possible for the model reference of a component to become "undefined"
2013-09-23T19:38:45 <Bosmon> BIG CHANGES are afoot!
2013-09-23T19:38:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: whoa.. that\'s different.. did you want to have this talk before or after the 1.5 release?
2013-09-23T19:39:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess it can happen concurrently or whenever
2013-09-23T19:39:12 <Bosmon> You will need to "opt in" to the new system by using the new grade of "modelRelayComponent"
2013-09-23T19:39:22 <Bosmon> So it shouldn\'t bother anyone who doesn\'t want to opt in to it
2013-09-23T19:39:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay..
2013-09-23T19:39:39 <Bosmon> But for 2.0 this grade will become simply renamed to "modelComponent" and we will abolish the old one
2013-09-23T19:39:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there enough for a whole community meeting for this topic?
2013-09-23T19:40:09 <Bosmon> Probably, yes
2013-09-23T19:40:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you want to lead one on Oct 9 for this topic?
2013-09-23T19:40:50 <Bosmon> I guess that\'s conceivable, yes
2013-09-23T19:41:05 <Bosmon> I should have something implemented by then
2013-09-23T19:42:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool.. i\'ll book one for then.. if you can\'t let me know and we can change it
2013-09-23T19:42:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2013-09-23T19:43:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops
2013-09-23T19:43:20 <Bosmon> This will enable us to do a number of helpful things, for example not having to wrap every component\'s value in some stupid name such as "value"
2013-09-23T19:43:32 <Bosmon> We realised we had to do this very early on, when InlineEdit was designed
2013-09-23T19:43:45 <Bosmon> But it was an inevitable consequence of the "shared model reference" model we had started with
2013-09-23T19:44:21 <Bosmon> And of course we continue to find ourselves doing this in situations such as UIOptions\' panels etc.
2013-09-23T19:44:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have to run now, thanks for the chat.. i think i have enough to keep me going on FLUID-5131
2013-09-23T19:44:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes. that\'s true
2013-09-23T19:44:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool!
2013-09-23T19:44:37 <Bosmon> Good luck
2013-09-23T19:44:39 <Justin_o> we have a lot of those
2013-09-23T19:44:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks

2013-09-23T16:20:37 <jhung> Yes. It\'s supposed to rotate. vjonna can let me know if it\'s rotating the right way and if it\'s rotating enough or too much. :)
2013-09-23T16:20:42 <jhung> ^Justin_o
2013-09-23T16:24:54 <Justin_o> jhung: just showed vjoanna.. so generally looks good.. the border shouldn\'t show up on hover though.. and it seems that there is either a bottom border or something causing a line to show between the panel bar and the rest of the panel which shouldn\'t be there
2013-09-23T16:25:21 <jhung> So the outline should go? Justin_o?
2013-09-23T16:25:38 <Justin_o> jhung: yes
2013-09-23T16:25:56 <vjoanna> orange outline just on focus state, not on hover :)
2013-09-23T16:26:38 <jhung> Ok. I\'ll switch that to focus. Also please see contrast modes and see if it\'s acceptable vjoanna.

2013-09-23T18:43:56 <jessm> "The email delays are affecting less than 50% of Gmail users."
2013-09-23T18:44:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: hello.. you have some time to chat?
2013-09-23T18:44:51 <Bosmon2> Justin_o - yes, I was expecting to chat with you : P
2013-09-23T18:45:00 <Bosmon2> let me just give THER CATT his **CATT FFOOD** .....
2013-09-23T18:45:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: okay.. i\'ll start typing in here while you do that :)
2013-09-23T18:46:00 <Bosmon2> I did read your report from Friday, but needed some more details on your plan in order to understand it
2013-09-23T18:46:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: thanks for looking it over.. i have something in the branch now, so that might help.
2013-09-23T18:46:46 <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5131/src/components/uiOptions/js/Panels.js
2013-09-23T18:47:01 <Justin_o> more specifically
2013-09-23T18:47:06 <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5131/src/components/uiOptions/js/Panels.js#L97-L116
2013-09-23T18:47:24 <Justin_o> so what i\'d like to do is be able to use an expander to create the distributeOptions block
2013-09-23T18:47:37 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2013-09-23T18:48:17 <Justin_o> the reason why is that i want to the combinedPanel to be able to automatically generate this itself, and it won\'t really know ahead of time what the sub panels all are.
2013-09-23T18:48:55 <Justin_o> in my case i\'m trying to distribute a gradeName that will have all of the settings needed.
2013-09-23T18:49:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think this issue is the reason that you would need to build a "grade-combining grade"
2013-09-23T18:49:22 <Bosmon> But I guess another thing I meant by this at the time, was that you would write a grade which takes more of the approach similar to the "AuxBuilder"
2013-09-23T18:49:39 <Bosmon> In that it violates our normal recommendation on not issuing a grade description dynamically
2013-09-23T18:49:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the auxiliary builder actually creates the entire components block
2013-09-23T18:49:48 <Bosmon> This is one of those situations where I think you can\'t really get away with it
2013-09-23T18:49:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-09-23T18:49:56 <Justin_o> :(
2013-09-23T18:50:01 <Bosmon> Or rather, "you can\'t get away without it"
2013-09-23T18:50:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so we need to have another type of schema ?
2013-09-23T18:50:23 <Bosmon> There is too much dynamism in the component to be able to expect to be able to issue its defaults block statically
2013-09-23T18:50:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you ALREADY have the schema, luckily : P
2013-09-23T18:50:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it won\'t work for people who don\'t have the schema
2013-09-23T18:50:48 <Bosmon> All the information you need can be discovered from i) the preferencesMap, and ii) the existing defaults block
2013-09-23T18:50:52 <Justin_o> there will be a lot for them to do manually
2013-09-23T18:50:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o ^
2013-09-23T18:51:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that parts okay.. the problem is knowing which panels are the subpanels
2013-09-23T18:51:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it would have been nice to have just been able to use the components block in the options..
2013-09-23T18:51:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that can also be discovered from those sources
2013-09-23T18:51:52 <Justin_o> it seems strange to have to have a different method
2013-09-23T18:52:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how is that?
2013-09-23T18:52:16 <Bosmon> By, as you say, inspecting the components block
2013-09-23T18:52:56 <Bosmon> Actually, you CAN achieve the effect you want from your commented-out block right now
2013-09-23T18:53:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: really
2013-09-23T18:53:05 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-23T18:53:06 * mrvisser has quit
2013-09-23T18:53:09 <Justin_o> what am i missing?
2013-09-23T18:53:09 <Bosmon> All you need to do is issue a dynamic grade, which adds an extra supergrade to the current component
2013-09-23T18:53:17 <Bosmon> Which contains the distributeOptions block you need
2013-09-23T18:53:31 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-23T18:53:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmmm.. but i would still need a way to generate that distributeOptions blcok
2013-09-23T18:54:02 <Justin_o> block
2013-09-23T18:54:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, but you needed one anyway : P
2013-09-23T18:54:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i just don\'t know how to do that still ;)
2013-09-23T18:54:25 <Bosmon> And as your expander shows, you already know that the information you need to generate it can be derived from the "components" block of this component
2013-09-23T18:54:31 <Bosmon> Which can be discovered by inspecting its defaults
2013-09-23T18:54:57 <Bosmon> //         args: ["{that}.options.components"]
2013-09-23T18:55:08 <Bosmon> It\'s clear you were aware this is where the information you required was : P
2013-09-23T18:55:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. that parts okay.. i just don\'t know how to do the actually creation of the distributeOptions block.. since it can\'t take an expander
2013-09-23T18:56:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - probably best to write a function which creates a wholly new grade, and then returns the name of that grade
2013-09-23T18:56:56 <Bosmon> I know this is something we don\'t normally recommend, but it is probably the best way out of this current situation
2013-09-23T18:57:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. and in this function i\'ll just create a simple json structure that gets passed into the call to fluid.defaults of the new grade
2013-09-23T18:57:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2013-09-23T18:58:09 <Bosmon> This will all be "temporary infrastructure" in any case, since all of this requirement will go away once we have the "new renderer"
2013-09-23T18:58:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i also had a question about the combining of templates
2013-09-23T18:58:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yeah !!! :)
2013-09-23T18:58:28 <Bosmon> But your implementation will be useful as a study for what the "new renderer" will need to do
2013-09-23T18:58:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: looking forward to having the declarative change applier listeners soon too :)
2013-09-23T18:58:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that is now simply a matter of REVIEW : P
2013-09-23T18:59:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i was taking a peek at your pull request this morning.. the syntax looked good
