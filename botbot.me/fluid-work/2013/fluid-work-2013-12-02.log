2013-12-02T22:01:00 <jhung1> I\'ve been using this as a hub colinclark - not sure if it\'s the most appropriate but the metadata related content was already there. http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+OER+Commons+Access+for+All+metadata+design
2013-12-02T22:01:20 * jhung1 is now known as jhung_brb
2013-12-02T22:01:29 <colinclark> We should make a new and more visible wiki page
2013-12-02T22:01:49 <colinclark> one that makes it clear that this is a much larger Floe effort, rather than just a little project we did in OER Commons a year or two ago
2013-12-02T22:02:09 <colinclark> It\'d be a good place to park our wireframes, too

2013-12-02T20:35:33 <jhung1> Sorry colinclark, anastasiac - the annotations in the PDF I linked to earlier is a bit of a mess. Sorry.
2013-12-02T20:35:46 <colinclark> no worries

2013-12-02T20:55:48 <jhung1> colinclark: would you think it would be okay if the video in the metadata demo not be playable? (i.e. not use a video player).
2013-12-02T21:00:21 <colinclark> That would be a bit awkward
2013-12-02T21:00:21 <colinclark> is there a reason for taking that approach?
2013-12-02T21:03:57 <jhung1> Justin_o - care to explain to colinclark the issue?
2013-12-02T21:04:59 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-12-02T21:09:03 <danaayotte_> colinclark do you think the editor window needs more real estate in the authoring page as well?
2013-12-02T21:09:34 <Justin_o> jhung1, colinclark: actually i was suggesting that we use the plain video tag instead of the fluid videoplayer
2013-12-02T21:10:05 <danaayotte_> colinclark: we were thinking it makes sense to have less real estate there since the focus is on metadata creation
2013-12-02T21:12:43 <colinclark> You guys would know best how to use the available screen real estate
2013-12-02T21:12:50 <colinclark> and I like that this is clearly framed as a demo
2013-12-02T21:13:01 <colinclark> but on the other hand, we also want these things to have the potential to be useful as they grow
2013-12-02T21:13:16 <colinclark> the components that make up the metadata authoring UX, for example
2013-12-02T21:13:42 <colinclark> presumably, we\'ll want them to fit into a workflow where editing is indeed the primary activity of the user
2013-12-02T21:13:56 <colinclark> what do you think about all this, danaayotte_?
2013-12-02T21:14:01 <colinclark> Justin_o: Can you elaborate on why?
2013-12-02T21:16:49 <danaayotte_> colinclark: to clarify, you mean metadata authoring, right?  not content editing in the editor window?
2013-12-02T21:17:16 <danaayotte_> as in \xe2\x80\xa6a workflow where metadata authoring is indeed the primary activity of the user?
2013-12-02T21:17:38 <colinclark> no
2013-12-02T21:17:40 <colinclark> the opposite
2013-12-02T21:17:42 <colinclark> :)
2013-12-02T21:17:44 <danaayotte_> wow, ok
2013-12-02T21:17:50 <colinclark> I\'m saying...
2013-12-02T21:17:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure. 1) is for simplification which includes simpler markup for viewing source and trying to see the metadata 2) there didn\'t seem to be a playable view yet so it seemed like a lot of trouble when all we want is the markup.  although this might be changing.. and i\'m sort of thinking that we actually want something else in the editor now.. that
2013-12-02T21:17:53 <Justin_o> links back to the metadata entries..
2013-12-02T21:17:54 <colinclark> make a nice demo
2013-12-02T21:17:58 <colinclark> but think beyond the demo
2013-12-02T21:17:59 <danaayotte_> :)
2013-12-02T21:18:05 <danaayotte_> got it
2013-12-02T21:18:36 <colinclark> I should be really clear
2013-12-02T21:18:42 <colinclark> When we make demos like this, we\'re not just making demos
2013-12-02T21:18:46 <colinclark> we\'re starting
2013-12-02T21:18:54 <colinclark> we\'re taking a little step forward to doing something real
2013-12-02T21:18:55 * jessm joined the channel
2013-12-02T21:18:59 <colinclark> that real users would use in real authoring tools
2013-12-02T21:19:09 <danaayotte_> yes
2013-12-02T21:19:14 <colinclark> So we\'ve definitely got a super-limited amount of time for our first "slice"
2013-12-02T21:19:24 <colinclark> and we can make lots of trade-offs and compromises as need to get started
2013-12-02T21:19:30 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-12-02T21:19:35 * mrvisser_ has quit
2013-12-02T21:19:40 <colinclark> but we do want to grow these things for real
2013-12-02T21:20:20 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think you\'ll need to elaborate a bit more
2013-12-02T21:20:30 <colinclark> I can sort of vaguely see a set of expectations about how you\'ll implement it
2013-12-02T21:20:35 <colinclark> but it\'s pretty fuzzy
2013-12-02T21:20:45 <colinclark> to me
2013-12-02T21:20:53 <colinclark> undoubtedly, it\'s much clearer to you :)
2013-12-02T21:22:25 <colinclark> I guess the key thing I\'m unclear on is the "for viewing source and trying to see the metadata" part
2013-12-02T21:22:28 <jhung1> colinclark: that helps a lot.
2013-12-02T21:23:30 <Justin_o> colinclark: mostly i\'m just concerned about simplification in light of the time we have.. if we weren\'t going to actually have a functional video it didn\'t make sense to use the video player.. there are some other limitations as well though, like playing audio descriptions likely isn\'t supported
2013-12-02T21:23:41 <jhung1> Basically we want anyone who sees our demo to instantly understand how metadata can be plugged into their application. So the way we have it arrange right now doesn\'t strongly convey that because "real" content applications have larger emphasis on content creation as the workflow, not the metadata. So we have to marry ourselves into that context.
2013-12-02T21:23:48 <jhung1> ^colinclark about right?
2013-12-02T21:24:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: the viewing metatdata part was about the requirement to view source.. the extra markup will add clutter for sure.. perhaps it won\'t be too bad though
2013-12-02T21:24:36 <colinclark> ah, I see what you mean, Justin_o
2013-12-02T21:24:46 <colinclark> so the "View HTML" button lets someone see the underlying markup
2013-12-02T21:24:51 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2013-12-02T21:24:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes
2013-12-02T21:25:26 <colinclark> the point being that they can see what kind of effect all our metadata-editing components can have on the resource itself?
2013-12-02T21:26:00 <colinclark> jhung1: yep, pretty much
2013-12-02T21:26:36 <Justin_o> colinclark: the metadata is also encoded into the document
2013-12-02T21:26:40 <colinclark> right
2013-12-02T21:26:46 <colinclark> Okay, so I think there are two sides to this, Justin_o
2013-12-02T21:26:52 <colinclark> Now, and later
2013-12-02T21:27:02 * anvk1 joined the channel
2013-12-02T21:27:12 <colinclark> Now, you\'re saying "there is no view mode"
2013-12-02T21:27:55 <colinclark> i.e. there is--for this first preliminary two week sprint--no way to view the content you\'ve been editing in the editor
2013-12-02T21:28:11 <colinclark> in which case, I agree, a Video Player instance won\'t be particularly useful :)
2013-12-02T21:28:31 <colinclark> Presumably in our second sprint, we might add some kind of view mode
2013-12-02T21:28:57 <colinclark> When we get to that point, I guess we might want to think of the content that the user is editing as a kind of "template"
2013-12-02T21:29:24 * cindyli has quit
2013-12-02T21:29:24 * anvk has quit
2013-12-02T21:29:30 <colinclark> perhaps with simplified semantics that make it easy to author without having to worry about the details of a more complex component
2013-12-02T21:29:50 <colinclark> and then, at "view time," we\'d be able to inject components using the Renderer
2013-12-02T21:30:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes.. that makes sense
2013-12-02T21:31:17 <colinclark> Thinking way into the future, where we have some kind of really great authoring tool, that approach need not preclude a user opening up the details of a particular component, say the Video Player, and editing the details of its template, too
2013-12-02T21:31:43 <colinclark> but you might imagine an expanding level of detail, starting with much more high-level, meaningful semantics
2013-12-02T21:31:49 <colinclark> like "this is my navigation area"
2013-12-02T21:31:56 <colinclark> and "I want a video player over here"
2013-12-02T21:32:21 <colinclark> anyway, I\'m undoubtedly getting ahead of myself quite a bit ;)
2013-12-02T21:32:28 <Justin_o> colinclark: right, where you an drill down to more detal
2013-12-02T21:32:33 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2013-12-02T21:33:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool... so for this go round..  plain html5 video tags ?
2013-12-02T21:33:13 <colinclark> yep
2013-12-02T21:33:17 <colinclark> seems fine to mee
2013-12-02T21:33:18 <colinclark> me
2013-12-02T21:33:36 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool thanks
2013-12-02T21:33:54 <colinclark> no problem
2013-12-02T21:33:56 <colinclark> sorry i was so confused
2013-12-02T21:34:41 <colinclark> danaayotte_, jhung1: I guess, philosophically, our approach is to minimize the user\'s awareness of "metadata" as much as is absolutely possible
2013-12-02T21:35:03 <colinclark> and wherever they do have to interact with it, it should be as smoothly part of the process of them just making stuff and being creative
2013-12-02T21:35:44 <danaayotte_> thanks colinclark, that helps clarify
2013-12-02T21:35:59 <colinclark> I was thinking about techniques for this the other day, since it\'s a really hard problem
2013-12-02T21:36:17 <colinclark> The new version of Pages has this "opportunistic structure" mode editing documents
2013-12-02T21:36:31 <Bosmon> colinclark - "Pages"?
2013-12-02T21:36:55 <colinclark> We still need to get you that iCloud account, Bosmon
2013-12-02T21:37:03 <Bosmon> It seems impossible
2013-12-02T21:37:19 <Bosmon> I went through the full rigmarole and was still told that "this Apple ID cannot be used for an iCloud account"
2013-12-02T21:37:28 <Bosmon> Because of course I have not paid them MONEY for THINGS
2013-12-02T21:37:39 <colinclark> that doesn\'t make any sense, but Justin_o probably knows more about these things
2013-12-02T21:37:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you try this site https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/wa/createAppleId
2013-12-02T21:37:47 <colinclark> Pages tries to encourage you to use structural styles as you\'re editing
2013-12-02T21:37:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-12-02T21:38:00 <Bosmon> I have an Apple ID
2013-12-02T21:38:06 <colinclark> what a url!
2013-12-02T21:38:07 <Bosmon> It still does not permit me to use iCloud
2013-12-02T21:38:16 <colinclark> michelled remembers URLs like this very well
2013-12-02T21:38:22 <Bosmon> They can detect that I am not DEVOUT
2013-12-02T21:38:30 <Bosmon> Because I have no APPLE DEVICES
2013-12-02T21:38:44 <colinclark> Pages shows you text style pane as you\'re editing
2013-12-02T21:38:58 <danaayotte_> colinclark could you share a screenshot or two?
2013-12-02T21:39:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you can\'t use iCloud at all.. or just not the iWork suite?
2013-12-02T21:39:07 <colinclark> and sees, for example, if you\'ve changed what it thinks is the "body style"
2013-12-02T21:39:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no iCloud
2013-12-02T21:39:22 <colinclark> and sort of vaguely prompts you to update it
2013-12-02T21:39:29 <colinclark> danaayotte_: It might be easier to try it yourself
2013-12-02T21:39:39 <Bosmon> colinclark - I\'d appreciate some screenshots :)
2013-12-02T21:39:53 <colinclark> I\'m trying to figure out quite how to do this
2013-12-02T21:39:59 <colinclark> I guess I might have to make a video
2013-12-02T21:40:06 <colinclark> to be clear, I think it\'s pretty unsuccessful
2013-12-02T21:40:20 <colinclark> in that it keeps distracting me as I write
2013-12-02T21:40:24 <colinclark> but it is trying something that Word typically completely hides
2013-12-02T21:40:30 <Bosmon> So is "Eufloria"... it is still a valuable source of UI ideas : P
2013-12-02T21:40:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4436?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US
2013-12-02T21:41:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I am aware of this
2013-12-02T21:41:15 <Bosmon> As you read the page, you find the description of the requirements
2013-12-02T21:41:29 <Bosmon> Which I suggest you do :)
2013-12-02T21:41:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so yes you need to create it form an apple device.. but that should be all...
2013-12-02T21:42:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - but I have none - and I believe that each such device must be associated with a unique Apple ID, no?
2013-12-02T21:42:12 <Bosmon> I imagine that Apple is no better about device sharing than Google
2013-12-02T21:42:36 <colinclark> not without the GPII!
2013-12-02T21:42:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think you can just create a new account on a Mac
2013-12-02T21:42:45 <Justin_o> then you can delete that user account
2013-12-02T21:42:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2013-12-02T21:43:07 <colinclark> what\'s the best way to share a few casual screenshots?
2013-12-02T21:43:16 <Bosmon> colinclark - attachments to the wiki?
2013-12-02T21:43:21 <colinclark> stick it in the wiki, or is there some kind of pastie equivalent?
2013-12-02T21:43:32 <Justin_o> i\'m heading out now.. good luck with your iCloud account Bosmon
2013-12-02T21:43:41 <Bosmon> Well
2013-12-02T21:43:47 <Bosmon> Someday I will run into someone with a Mac
2013-12-02T21:43:48 <Bosmon> :)
2013-12-02T21:44:01 <colinclark> we\'ll do it in person in Madison, Bosmon
2013-12-02T21:44:08 <colinclark> I\'ll set you up an account on my macbook
2013-12-02T21:44:12 <Bosmon> great
2013-12-02T21:44:19 <Bosmon> Then I will be ENFRANCHISED!
2013-12-02T21:44:22 <colinclark> and then you can hook it up to your apple id
2013-12-02T21:45:22 * cindyli1 has quit

2013-12-02T15:00:08 <Justin_o> jhung: documentation.. i\'d like to go with the one that easier to get started with.. i think that\'s basically it
2013-12-02T15:00:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: any other reason
2013-12-02T15:00:19 <Justin_o> ?
2013-12-02T15:03:05 <colinclark> LESS\'s Node-based toolchain is appealing to me, too.
2013-12-02T15:07:19 <jhung> Justin_o, cindyli - I\'m fine with Bootstrap. I mean we have to start somewhere to figure out which one of these frameworks to adopt for our demos.

2013-12-02T15:36:24 <Justin_o> jhung, cindyli: maybe we can just use the CDN distribution for now.. so we don\'t clutter the repo. what do you think?
2013-12-02T15:37:23 <cindyli> Justin_o: what is "CDN distribution"\xe2\x80\xa6.
2013-12-02T15:37:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn
2013-12-02T15:37:39 <Justin_o> basically just hosted versions
2013-12-02T15:38:06 <Justin_o> so you just use a url to a web resource
2013-12-02T15:38:16 <Justin_o> if you don\'t have internet though, it won\'t work
2013-12-02T15:38:59 <cindyli> i see. +1
2013-12-02T15:39:08 <Justin_o> okay.. cool. thanks
2013-12-02T15:42:46 <jhung> Justin_o sounds fine to me.
2013-12-02T15:43:05 <Justin_o> jhung: bootstrap has aria roles in there examples http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-toolbar
2013-12-02T15:43:26 <jhung> Justin_o, cindyli, anastasiac - do you have time to chat Metadata encoding?
2013-12-02T15:43:34 <Justin_o> jhung: sure
2013-12-02T15:43:34 <cindyli> sure
2013-12-02T15:43:40 <anastasiac> any time
2013-12-02T15:43:42 <jhung> Skype okay?
2013-12-02T15:44:13 <jhung> Actually. Let\'d do it in the channel.
2013-12-02T15:44:42 <jhung> I have 2 questions about metadata encoding Justin_o, anastasiac, cindyli
2013-12-02T15:45:40 <jhung> Question 1: How is metadata handled for multiple media files in a single HTML document?
2013-12-02T15:46:18 <jhung> Question 2: How can we support title and descriptions for each media file? Is there metadata to handle that?
2013-12-02T15:47:47 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding #1: there are different ways this could be handled with schema.org micro formats. Since the metadata is embedded within the markup, it could be a) all up at the beginning of the document, attempting to describe the document as a whole, or b) scattered throughout the document, describing different bits. The element containment defines the scope of the metadata. Does that make sense?
2013-12-02T15:48:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: if it\'s the document as a whole would that be in the body or the html tag?
2013-12-02T15:48:48 <jhung> anastasiac: Ah cool. I think currently our metadata editing is working on the element level - so probably option b.
2013-12-02T15:49:02 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I believe it would be on or inside the body tag
2013-12-02T15:49:11 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2013-12-02T15:49:27 <anastasiac> personally, I think option b provides much more power, providing search engines use it accordingly
2013-12-02T15:49:33 <jhung> Justin_o: http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility has examples toward the bottom of the page.
2013-12-02T15:50:20 <jhung> anastasiac: the examples linked above actually shows option b you mentioned. Cool.
2013-12-02T15:50:22 * jessm has quit
2013-12-02T15:50:38 <anastasiac> jhung, the bottom of that page also has links to more examples
2013-12-02T15:50:47 <jhung> Thanks.
2013-12-02T15:52:32 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding question #2, I\'m pretty sure there are other schema.org micro formats that would be more than suitable for title and description
2013-12-02T15:52:41 <anastasiac> searching...
2013-12-02T15:53:04 <anastasiac> jhung: http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html
2013-12-02T15:53:17 <anastasiac> they use an inheritance scheme
2013-12-02T15:53:26 <anastasiac> so probably creative work has the basics like title
2013-12-02T15:53:37 <anastasiac> or event Thing
2013-12-02T15:53:52 <anastasiac> but if you search, say, videoObject, it will tell you where things are inherited from
2013-12-02T15:54:29 <anastasiac> jhung, I think that if we\'re using the schema.org version of the a11y md, we might as well use other schema.org micro formats for other md; Justin_o, would you agree?
2013-12-02T15:56:04 <Justin_o> anastasiac, jhung: i don\'t know if i fully understand but it sounds reasonable
2013-12-02T15:56:29 <anastasiac> :-)
2013-12-02T15:57:30 <jhung> So I guess the trick now is to find the schema.org metadata that will encode all the bits of metadata we\'re dealing with for the demo anastasiac.
2013-12-02T15:57:55 <anastasiac> jhung, should be pretty easy
2013-12-02T15:58:04 <anastasiac> it looks like Thing has basics like name, description
2013-12-02T15:58:13 <anastasiac> http://schema.org/Thing
2013-12-02T15:59:30 <jhung> anastasiac: cool. And I assume there should be a way of encoding alternative / equivalence relationships? i.e. Caption is an alternative to audio for a video.
2013-12-02T16:00:44 <anastasiac> ah, interesting, jhung. I was going to say "that\'s provided by the a11y md schema at http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility" but it\'s not
2013-12-02T16:00:51 <anastasiac> they seem to have left that out of this round of the draft
2013-12-02T16:00:58 <anastasiac> but we should go ahead and use the elements
2013-12-02T16:01:02 <anastasiac> I\'ll find a reference
2013-12-02T16:01:19 <anastasiac> jhung, have a look here: http://www.a11ymetadata.org/the-specification/
2013-12-02T16:01:26 <anastasiac> there\'s hasAdaptation and isAdaptationOf
2013-12-02T16:01:38 <anastasiac> that\'s how you encode the relationship
2013-12-02T16:02:23 <anastasiac> so on a video, you could add a property called "hasAdaptation" whose value is an url referencing a caption
2013-12-02T16:02:28 <anastasiac> and vice versa
2013-12-02T16:02:32 <anastasiac> make sense, jhung?
2013-12-02T16:03:10 <anastasiac> also, jhung I cannot recommend strongly enough that we use the accessMode property described on this page, even though it\'s only "under consideration"
2013-12-02T16:03:20 <jhung> that works anastasiac, but it doesn\'t offer much granularity. I.e. it doesn\'t give you an option of saying what modality the adaptation is for\xe2\x80\xa6
2013-12-02T16:04:10 <jhung> anastasiac: ok. We\'ll be sure to support the values under accessMode.
2013-12-02T16:04:52 <anastasiac> jhung, that\'s true. Some info can be inferred from other md, e.g. if it\'s a caption, it\'s pretty obvious
2013-12-02T16:05:25 <anastasiac> if we encounter use cases where the md is inadequate, well, then we have good ammunition to take back to the people who developed the schema to tell them it\'s not good enough :-)
2013-12-02T16:05:26 <jhung> anastasiac: I was thinking of caption too, but caption can be for visuals as well for audio. :)
2013-12-02T16:05:47 <anastasiac> jhung, when would captions be used for visuals, and why?
2013-12-02T16:06:30 <jhung> i.e. a video can contain a segment with a billboard in a foreign language. Caption would be needed.
2013-12-02T16:06:52 <anastasiac> hm. I\'d call that a subtitle, not a caption
2013-12-02T16:07:23 <anastasiac> but still. hm..
2013-12-02T16:07:27 <anastasiac> it\'s a good point
2013-12-02T16:07:55 <anastasiac> well, we\'ll just have to do the best we can within the spec as it is, and identify the sticking points so that we can contribute to improvement of the spec
2013-12-02T16:08:54 <jhung> Justin_o, cindyli - so we\'ll have to figure out what metadata we\'ll need to be encoding. Hopefully danaayotte_ and I will have something we can talk about this afternoon.

2013-12-02T17:09:53 <colinclark> Justin_o: This was exactly the sort of thing I was thinking of when I speculated about simple document management for our authoring demo last week: http://pouchdb.com/
2013-12-02T17:10:28 <colinclark> I\'m sure we\'re not quite ready for it, but it looks like when we are, there are some good client-side persistence options available to us
2013-12-02T17:10:35 <colinclark> that can ultimately sync with a server-side data store later
2013-12-02T17:12:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s interesting
2013-12-02T17:12:41 <colinclark> Seems to me we\'d just want to make a new DataSource for Pouch, and we\'d be ready to rock with simple client-side persistence
2013-12-02T17:53:17 <Justin_o> colinclark: looks doable

2013-12-02T20:25:13 <colinclark> jhung1: I wonder if it might make sense to make the instruction text/icons a little less prominent in the metadata demo? Maybe just as some kind of status bar or tooltip or something, rather than taking screen real estate away from the editor itself?
2013-12-02T20:26:34 <jhung1> colinclark: that\'s a good thought. Would be less distracting in a demo situation.
