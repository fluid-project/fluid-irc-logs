2013-11-08T20:41:19 <Justin_o> michelled: i've submitted a pull request for the FLUID-5205 work https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/433

2013-11-08T20:44:03 <yzen> Justin_o: np :)
2013-11-08T20:44:03 <Justin_o> cindyli: our changes are in the gpii repo
2013-11-08T20:46:18 <cindyli> nice. i will merge in
2013-11-08T20:46:32 <Justin_o> thanks, do you have an estimate as to when your work will be done?
2013-11-08T20:46:48 <Justin_o> boyan was wondering when we'd get alex's branch in
2013-11-08T20:46:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2013-11-08T20:47:54 * mrvisser has quit
2013-11-08T20:48:47 <cindyli> Justin_o: to get my work with the new infusion should be soon
2013-11-08T20:49:17 <Justin_o> a day or so?
2013-11-08T20:49:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2013-11-08T20:49:29 <cindyli> since alex hasn't replied i'm not sure if he's going to send a pull request for the styling issue
2013-11-08T20:50:22 <cindyli> and dynamic invoker. but I can handle the invoker for sure. but do need his pull request for styling since it has been lost in the merge, Justin_o
2013-11-08T20:50:30 <cindyli> 1 day should be enough
2013-11-08T20:50:49 <cindyli> or even faster
2013-11-08T20:51:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
