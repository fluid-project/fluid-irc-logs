2013-09-05T13:12:35 <jhung> heidiv: I can\'t seem to activate the discovery tool panel using the keyboard. Was this always the case? (i.e. focus is on the panel, but space / enter doesn\'t open the panel).
2013-09-05T13:14:44 <heidiv> jhung i tab to the button and hit enter and it opens
2013-09-05T13:16:23 <jhung> heidiv: thanks. I think it may be something on my end then.

2013-09-05T13:16:36 <heidiv> jhung clear your cache?
2013-09-05T13:16:40 <jhung> also focus styling on demo content looks different in Webkit than it does in FF heidiv.
2013-09-05T13:18:54 <heidiv> jhung looks the same to me - which theme? clear cache from all browsers?
2013-09-05T13:19:03 <heidiv> win or mac?
2013-09-05T13:19:15 <jhung> heidiv: clearing now. Using Mac.
2013-09-05T13:22:25 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-09-05T13:23:06 <jhung> heidiv: that seems to do the trick. However focus gets put onto the panel bar before the button. Seems confusing.
2013-09-05T13:26:38 <heidiv> jhung i\'m not sure why it focuses the bar now - any thoughts?
2013-09-05T13:27:11 <heidiv> jhung noticing a couple other things: the download/share font icon arrow is strange in all themes
2013-09-05T13:27:33 <heidiv> and there\'s a horiz scroll bar even when browser is wide
2013-09-05T13:27:37 <heidiv> should make jiras for these...

2013-09-05T14:41:59 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, michelled, i rmb last week we were talking about updating myInfusion.js in the discovery tool to the latest. but seems it hasn\'t been updated yet. i wonder if there\'s anything stopping it from happening? The reason I\'m asking is \'cuz the error that Chris is having with PMT on the "uiEnhancerRelay" is caused by a bug that has been fixed in the latest infusion.
2013-09-05T14:42:30 * avtar joined the channel
2013-09-05T14:45:07 <colinclark> hey yzen: Have you started to use any of when.js\'s "promise composition" features?
2013-09-05T14:45:11 <colinclark> Like reduce()
2013-09-05T14:45:17 <colinclark> If so, can I see some code?
2013-09-05T14:45:24 <yzen> colinclark: not yet, but that\'s the goal for the lifecycle manager
2013-09-05T14:45:26 <michelled> cindyli: I don\'t know, perhaps it\'s a good time to try to upgrade
2013-09-05T14:45:31 <colinclark> awesome, yzen
2013-09-05T14:45:33 <colinclark> how will you use it?
2013-09-05T14:45:56 <yzen> so we have several settings handlers that we want to be truly async which would require the life cycle manager to support that
2013-09-05T14:46:07 <cindyli> ok, michelled, i will send a pull request
2013-09-05T14:46:12 <yzen> promises composition like reduce looks like a good fit
2013-09-05T14:46:59 <colinclark> So the idea is that you\'d have a promise that represents the completion of "the lifecycle process," which in turn consists of multiple promises, one each for the lifecycle actions involved?
2013-09-05T14:47:03 <colinclark> Am I understanding that right?
2013-09-05T14:48:58 <yzen> colinclark: correct yes
2013-09-05T14:49:35 <yzen> colinclark: this should also aid significantly to the integration tests stability
2013-09-05T14:51:13 <colinclark> how come, yzen?
2013-09-05T14:52:07 <yzen> colinclark: well kasparnet suspects there might be issues with asynchrony when applying settings..
2013-09-05T14:52:27 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2013-09-05T14:53:36 <colinclark> yzen: What do you think is the best example of the use of Promises in the current system?
2013-09-05T14:54:00 <yzen> colinclark: well we use them in the matchmaker
2013-09-05T14:55:11 <cindyli> michelled: the infusion in the discovery tool has been brought to the latest with Justin_o\'s pull request being merged in yesterday. so, no more pull request on that from me. :)
2013-09-05T14:55:30 <michelled> yay :)

2013-09-05T16:06:33 <cindyli> Justin_o: our schema version of full with preview demo is broken: http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/html/uiOptionsFullWithPreviewSchema.html. seems just need to correct the url to the preview window. do you think the pull request to gpii/prefsEditors should wait till this is fixed?
2013-09-05T16:06:41 <cindyli> creating a jira for it...
2013-09-05T16:11:47 <cindyli> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5124
2013-09-05T16:13:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: it probably doesn\'t matter, the demos aren\'t in the package we have in the Discovery Tool
2013-09-05T16:13:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: but we should fix that asap, thanks for spotting it
2013-09-05T16:14:06 <cindyli> ok, i will send a pull request for it, Justin_o
2013-09-05T16:14:08 <Justin_o> yzen: can you take a look at this pull request https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/5

2013-09-05T17:17:36 <kasparnet> argh, no ... I keep forgetting
2013-09-05T17:25:31 <Justin_o> kasparnet: okay, when you get to it, could you please let avtar know
2013-09-05T17:45:06 <cindyli> michelled: i sent a pull request for FLUID-5124 to fix the schema version of the full with preview demo. Can you take a look when you have a chance?
