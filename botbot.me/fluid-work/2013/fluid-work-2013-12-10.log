b'2013-12-10T21:42:02 <jhung> I\'m going to have to write that up and see if there\'s a way to communicate that in Metadata. Otherwise anastasiac may have another question to take to the working group. :)
2013-12-10T21:42:15 <cindyli> :)
2013-12-10T21:43:05 <anastasiac> jhung, cindyli: the "accessibilityFeature:captions" would be perfectly adequate for that use case. You just don\'t need the hasAdaptation link
2013-12-10T21:43:25 <anastasiac> I think you can have more than one instance
2013-12-10T21:43:41 <anastasiac> I\'ll double-check that, but it certainly works for keywords
2013-12-10T21:43:45 <jhung> anastasiac: how would we describe the language of that caption in this case?
2013-12-10T21:44:53 <anastasiac> hm
2013-12-10T21:49:33 <cindyli> anastasiac, jhung, i\'m heading out. will check back the conversation tomorrow. see you
2013-12-10T21:49:57 * cindyli has quit
2013-12-10T21:53:15 <anastasiac> jhung, google has a rich snippets validator: http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets
2013-12-10T21:53:37 <anastasiac> running our examples through it might help us to understand how the elements and properties work
2013-12-10T22:00:36 <jhung> anastasiac: thanks. It\'s worth a try.

b'2013-12-10T18:00:44 <colinclark> ah, madskillz, kasparnet
2013-12-10T18:01:47 <kasparnet> colinclark, michelled: btw, last time I tried installing it, I gave up before even finishing - and came crying to Javi about how the world and the Great Gods of Linux were being unfair to me...
2013-12-10T18:02:03 <colinclark> woah, that sucks
2013-12-10T18:02:07 <colinclark> why, kasparnet?
2013-12-10T18:02:13 <michelled> kasparnet: that sounds familiar
2013-12-10T18:02:15 <colinclark> what provoked your tears?
2013-12-10T18:02:18 <michelled> except I went to Yura
2013-12-10T18:02:20 <kasparnet> colinclark: dont even remember... but it was very unfair
2013-12-10T18:02:25 <kasparnet> michelled: lol
2013-12-10T18:02:42 <kasparnet> colinclark: actually I think it was some complications when installing node
2013-12-10T18:02:53 <colinclark> Let me just boot up my super reliable Fedora 18 VM, just for fun :P
2013-12-10T18:03:21 <colinclark> Maybe Fedora 19 sucks?
2013-12-10T18:03:44 <colinclark> michelled: So does "nothing" mean "locked up?"
2013-12-10T18:03:47 <colinclark> crashed
2013-12-10T18:03:51 <colinclark> dead and unresponsive?
2013-12-10T18:04:29 <michelled> colinclark: yes, locked up
2013-12-10T18:04:42 <colinclark> but only with the onscreen keyboard?
2013-12-10T18:04:47 <colinclark> other preference sets work?
2013-12-10T18:04:50 <colinclark> and don\'t crash?>
2013-12-10T18:05:01 <michelled> well, I suppose that remains to be seen. andrei works fine
2013-12-10T18:05:04 <michelled> not crashing
2013-12-10T18:05:53 <colinclark> Did you enable 3D acceleration in VirtualBox?
2013-12-10T18:06:01 <colinclark> And did you install the VirtualBox Guest Additions?
2013-12-10T18:06:16 <colinclark> All this stuff: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment#Fedora_In_VirtualBox
2013-12-10T18:09:58 <colinclark> michelled: ^
2013-12-10T18:10:02 <michelled> so, yes to the 3d acceleration. yzen had already updated the kernel. and I\'m not sure about the guest additions
2013-12-10T18:10:17 <michelled> not seeing a \'devices\' option in virtual box

2013-12-10T18:12:03 <colinclark> Interesting, maybe the option has changed
2013-12-10T18:12:10 <colinclark> you definitely want the guest additions before doing too much else
2013-12-10T18:12:47 <colinclark> http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html
2013-12-10T18:20:35 <michelled> sigh. I think this VM is a dead end for me. I guess I\'ll have to try to build it up from scratch again.
2013-12-10T18:20:49 <colinclark> suuuucks
2013-12-10T18:20:56 <michelled> kasparnet: do you have the users created for the review?
2013-12-10T18:21:34 <colinclark> Honestly, Fish...
2013-12-10T18:21:39 <colinclark> Fedora 20 is due in 1 week
2013-12-10T18:21:51 <colinclark> You might just want to embrace the bleeding edge
2013-12-10T18:22:14 <colinclark> http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-prerelease
2013-12-10T18:22:28 <michelled> are we going to demo on 19 or 20?
2013-12-10T18:22:35 <colinclark> ah
2013-12-10T18:22:41 <colinclark> you\'re focused on the review
2013-12-10T18:22:44 <michelled> yes
2013-12-10T18:22:56 <colinclark> well, then you know the answer to that question :P
2013-12-10T18:23:19 <colinclark> 19 it is
2013-12-10T18:23:20 <michelled> well, I would think 19, but I truly thought this was going to be easier than it is
2013-12-10T18:23:32 <colinclark> it really should be fairly straightforward
2013-12-10T18:23:49 <colinclark> I\'ll try it on Fedora 20 and VirtualBox just to see if we\'ve got a problem
2013-12-10T18:24:14 <colinclark> But I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t be able to just follow the install instructions and have a nciely-working machine
2013-12-10T18:24:30 <colinclark> if you can\'t, we\'ve probably got BUGS

2013-12-10T18:58:35 <cindyli> michelled, Justin_o, i issued 2 pull requests for metadata demo. https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/2 for fixing indicator component with michelled\'s comments; https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/3 for implementing the video metadata panel. Can either of you review them when you have a chance?
2013-12-10T18:59:10 <cindyli> please note that https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/2 needs to go in first since the other pull request has it merged in.
2013-12-10T18:59:35 <michelled> thanks cindyli - I\'m looking now

2013-12-10T19:25:13 <cindyli> danaayotte, is this the latest wireframe for metadata demo - https://www.dropbox.com/s/ek0at7gil6ko25c/metadata%20demo%20iterations.pdf
2013-12-10T19:25:41 <cindyli> do you have one that shows how captions panel looks like?
2013-12-10T19:26:32 <danaayotte> yes it is cindyli - page 5 shows captions panel
2013-12-10T19:27:01 <danaayotte> The last page shouldn\'t be there - I\'ll fix that up and reload to wiki.  But otherwise it is the latest
2013-12-10T19:27:30 <cindyli> apparently my page needs a refresh. thanks, danaayotte
2013-12-10T19:28:20 <cindyli> danaayotte: wonder if you have a language list?
2013-12-10T19:29:43 <danaayotte> not yet cindyli, sorry! Will do that now
2013-12-10T19:30:00 <cindyli> np. thanks, danaayotte
2013-12-10T19:34:27 <michelled> cindyli: I\'m still not understanding why you need to open and close the tooltip in that test. it looks like you check the styling in the tooltip, then open it, then close it
2013-12-10T19:35:28 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2013-12-10T19:40:41 <cindyli> michelled: open action triggers afterOpen event which is used to verify the tooltip content has been updated. from my experiment, the initial tooltip content wouldn\'t be updated until the tooltip becomes visible.
2013-12-10T19:43:30 <michelled> but cindyli, shouldn\'t the order be different then? https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/407526bda6a4bf51537e1c75d9aea0028f72ccbe/tests/js/indicatorTests.js#L32-L34
2013-12-10T19:43:41 <michelled> meaning, you\'d open the tooltip first, then check it, then close it?
2013-12-10T19:47:05 <cindyli> michelled: either order would work the same way. line 32 checks the css application which was done by indicator component and applied regardless the tooltip is visible or not. However, the tooltip content update is performed by jquery tooltip that requires the tooltip to be visible. so open() is for running line 24 - https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/407526bda6a4bf51537e1c75d9aea0028f72ccbe/tests/js/indicatorTests.js#L24
2013-12-10T19:48:22 <michelled> ah, thanks cindyli - makes sense
2013-12-10T19:48:30 <cindyli> np
2013-12-10T19:49:04 <cindyli> michelled: just tried more and noticed the initial open is needed by not the following ones, for checking tooltip content, which is these lines - https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/blob/407526bda6a4bf51537e1c75d9aea0028f72ccbe/tests/js/indicatorTests.js#L42-L43, will remov those and push up. good catch!
2013-12-10T19:49:22 <michelled> thx

2013-12-10T20:12:50 <michelled> jhung, danaayotte: do your designs include the keyboard interactions for using the editor demo?
2013-12-10T20:14:57 <jhung> michelled: it hasn\'t been documented yet.
2013-12-10T20:15:16 <jhung> danaayotte: I can do it if you\'re in the middle of something.
2013-12-10T20:15:52 <michelled> thanks jhung
2013-12-10T20:16:08 <michelled> cindyli: what does the \'flashing\' row refer to in the video template?
2013-12-10T20:17:26 <michelled> cindyli:  never mind - I read further down in the code and it\'s all very clear

2013-12-10T21:00:39 <jhung> cindyli, Justin_o: I\'ve updated the Metadata encoding document to include 6 languages we will support for captions. http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Encoding+Floe+Metadata+-+Tables+and+Examples
2013-12-10T21:01:09 <cindyli> thanks, jhung
2013-12-10T21:01:11 <michelled> cindyli: is that work under a separate JIRA?
2013-12-10T21:01:24 <cindyli> michelled: yes, video panel is under FLOE-117
2013-12-10T21:01:38 <cindyli> the one you are reviewing
2013-12-10T21:01:51 <michelled> right, but I don\'t see the new panel into the demo
2013-12-10T21:01:55 <michelled> am I missing something?
2013-12-10T21:02:29 <cindyli> michelled: it\'s not integrated with the editor yet
2013-12-10T21:02:50 <cindyli> i see what you mean, you are asking about the integration?
2013-12-10T21:03:28 <michelled> yes cindyli - right now all I can do is run the unit tests
2013-12-10T21:03:39 <michelled> I generally like to see something working as expected before I push it to the repo
2013-12-10T21:03:46 <cindyli> yes, michelled, i think integration is using FLOE-125
2013-12-10T21:05:31 <michelled> ok I\'ll push as is then, since I know you and Justin_o have divided the work up and rely on each other\'s code being in. I suppose it puts more responsibility on who ever is working on FLOE-125
2013-12-10T21:05:51 <cindyli> that\'s true
2013-12-10T21:06:06 <Justin_o> michelled: i suppose we might be pairing up on that
2013-12-10T21:06:16 <Justin_o> cindyli and I that is
2013-12-10T21:06:34 <cindyli> no objection :)

2013-12-10T21:21:58 <danaayotte> also, cindyli - for the demo we decided to set the language default to English -  since we won\'t be able to validate whether or not anything has been entered in the field - in this way we\'ll avoid generating invalid metadata
2013-12-10T21:22:36 <cindyli> understood, danaayotte

2013-12-10T21:38:52 <cindyli> jhung: captions panel has a section of "video already contains captions" and its language. how do we encode that metadata into the markup?
2013-12-10T21:41:00 <jhung> cindyli, maybe something like "accessibilityFeature:captions" and "inLanguage:<string>"?
2013-12-10T21:41:33 <jhung> But it will get messy if you have more than 1 caption because you won\'t know which caption is in which language. :/
'

b'2013-12-10T15:56:19 <colinclark> Presumably if I drew something in Illustrator, it would get "vetted" in a fundamentally different way than if danaayotte did the same thing
2013-12-10T15:56:28 <jessm> Jan contributes designs and he isn\'t paid by the IDRC
2013-12-10T15:56:40 <jessm> colinclark: because of merit or something else?
2013-12-10T15:57:06 <jessm> i don\'t think your illustrator file would be vetted differently
2013-12-10T15:57:22 <colinclark> Does JP have write access to your Dropbox files?
2013-12-10T15:57:30 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac: does it matter where the meta tags are written within a particular itemscope
2013-12-10T15:57:31 <Justin_o> ?
2013-12-10T15:57:36 <colinclark> Could JP edit a wiki page and place his design as an "official PMT design?"
2013-12-10T15:57:37 <colinclark> etc.
2013-12-10T15:57:56 <colinclark> vjoanna: I think it\'s worth making a distinction between "committing" and "releasing"
2013-12-10T15:57:57 <jessm> he gets raw files and edits them. yes, he could put it on the wiki, but he tends not to. he tends to send emails offlist!
2013-12-10T15:58:23 <colinclark> If a community runs by "lazy consensus" it means that work can happen smoothly, without, say, requiring someone to vote every time you change the colour of a button
2013-12-10T15:58:41 <colinclark> that sounds insane, but if you\'ve ever talked to jamesy, you know that\'s how it works at a bank ;)
2013-12-10T15:59:03 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m fairly sure it doesn\'t matter. I\'ll see if I can find documentation of this.
2013-12-10T15:59:10 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2013-12-10T15:59:36 <colinclark> vjoanna: So the key to things "just working" is to make sure whatever we\'re working on is visible to everyone as we work
2013-12-10T15:59:42 <colinclark> and then you don\'t have to have some kind of crazy, onerous process
2013-12-10T15:59:46 <anastasiac> Justin_o, my understanding is: within the div that defines the scope, the meta tags can be in any order, and can be interspersed with any other content. It does seem to be convention that actual <meta> tags are placed as the first thing within the containing div, but I don\'t believe that\'s a requirement. It\'s also correct to add \'itemprop\' attributes to specific elements, if it\'s appropriate. You can see that in the examples here
2013-12-10T15:59:46 <anastasiac> http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility
2013-12-10T15:59:54 <colinclark> so "committing" is the process of making things visible to everyone
2013-12-10T16:00:07 <colinclark> where "releasing" might be "making it stable," if that makes sense
2013-12-10T16:00:41 <colinclark> jessm: You\'re still really not addressing the basic power question...
2013-12-10T16:00:45 <danaayotte> that sounds reasonable to me, colinclark. and I suppose a design becomes "official" through discussion and agreement at meetings?
2013-12-10T16:00:50 <colinclark> yep
2013-12-10T16:00:51 <colinclark> exactly
2013-12-10T16:00:52 <jessm> colinclark: i think vjoanna and danaayotte have been accomplishing this laziness ;) by posting to the wiki when it\'s "solid" for devs and doing quick iterations in dropbox
2013-12-10T16:00:59 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s interesting and could be an answer to that long description question we had the other day
2013-12-10T16:01:03 <colinclark> yes, they have indeed, jessm
2013-12-10T16:01:24 <jessm> so, wrt mtgs. we\'ve been chatting through all our designs at the C4A mtgs.
2013-12-10T16:01:28 <anastasiac> Justin_o:
2013-12-10T16:01:29 <anastasiac> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta
2013-12-10T16:01:33 <colinclark> This conversation has nothing to do with how great danaayotte and vjoanna are
2013-12-10T16:01:41 <colinclark> :)
2013-12-10T16:01:41 <jessm> we\'ve run into this before -- what community? meeting discusses and vetts the designs.
2013-12-10T16:02:22 <danaayotte> we\'ll have that discussion later colinclark!
2013-12-10T16:02:24 <Justin_o> anastasiac: MDN must have launched a redesign overnight
2013-12-10T16:02:27 <colinclark> I\'m not quite sure I understand what that last sentence means
2013-12-10T16:02:30 <anastasiac> indeed
2013-12-10T16:02:45 <colinclark> jessm: ^
2013-12-10T16:02:47 <colinclark> danaayotte: :)
2013-12-10T16:03:19 <anastasiac> Justin_o, <meta> can be used anywhere flow content is permitted, so long as it has the itemprop attribute
2013-12-10T16:04:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2013-12-10T16:04:46 <jessm> the design bcomes official through discussion and agreement at meetings. yes? that addresses as you say the "power question." the PMT and PCP designs have been discussed every tues and thur in C4A community mtgs. with open notes posted to that community\'s ux list. metadata went through the open design mtg. last week and was discussed in a large group together onsite (though we didn\'t email fluid-work).
2013-12-10T16:04:58 <jessm> am i missing some hiding power gap?
2013-12-10T16:05:04 <jessm> i could very well be
2013-12-10T16:07:25 <colinclark> So what happens in case of disagreement?
2013-12-10T16:07:28 <colinclark> Who decides?
2013-12-10T16:11:34 <colinclark> What would happen if a big company like, say, IBM came along with their very corporate-minded designers and started attending all the meetings and loudly saying their way was the right way?
2013-12-10T16:11:36 <jessm> colinclark: just like in the dev community\xe2\x80\xa6 we discuss until we arrive at an agreement as a community.
2013-12-10T16:11:50 <colinclark> And contributed designs directly to the wiki, and so on?
2013-12-10T16:12:16 <jessm> colinclark: well, we have "leaders" within the projects who presumably have mandate for the solution.
2013-12-10T16:12:26 <jessm> colinclark: can\'t IBM do the same with dev?
2013-12-10T16:12:28 <colinclark> There\'s your power issue, right there
2013-12-10T16:12:31 <colinclark> No, they can\'t
2013-12-10T16:12:47 <colinclark> because there is a process for mentorship, for demonstrating contributions to the community
2013-12-10T16:12:49 <jessm> so we\'re back to a committer list?
2013-12-10T16:13:02 <colinclark> to progressively earning power and influence over time
2013-12-10T16:13:05 <colinclark> jessm: I didn\'t say that
2013-12-10T16:13:43 <colinclark> But you are probably going to need something that says "these people have earned influence as designers in our community"
2013-12-10T16:13:48 <jessm> yes, the meritocracy.
2013-12-10T16:13:50 <jessm> right
2013-12-10T16:14:02 <jessm> if not the committer list, how might we do this?
2013-12-10T16:14:10 <colinclark> and that they\'ve done it in a way that isn\'t just based on the fact that they sat in an office with you and discussed something, and that the IDRC pays them a cheque
2013-12-10T16:17:27 <jessm> i thought we already debunked the IDRC / cheque thing. the me thing? sat with me in an office? do you mean me, Jess or some other me? and isn\'t the committer list a good way to do this? or maybe we just call it something other than committer to try to avoid confusion with the formal process for the devs?
2013-12-10T16:18:40 <jessm> i\'m confused
2013-12-10T16:18:50 <colinclark> yeah
2013-12-10T16:19:39 <colinclark> I don\'t think you can debunk the "cheque issue" without having a clear means by which power--and the means by which it is earned and recognized--is made explicit, rather than implicit
2013-12-10T16:20:03 <colinclark> As for the "me" issue, we can consider it a hypothetical "me"
2013-12-10T16:21:27 <colinclark> And so far, the best precedents I can think of off the top of my head for this are either something like a design "committers list" or some kind of committee-plus-board structure
2013-12-10T16:21:42 <colinclark> My point, earlier, is that I didn\'t want to presume that one or the other was the right way to work
2013-12-10T16:21:49 <colinclark> though I\'m happy to presume so if you\'d like it
2013-12-10T16:22:27 <jessm> ah ok, colinclark what do you think about putting some notes on the wiki that explain how a design meritocracy might work and asking for feedback adn using it as a guide?
2013-12-10T16:24:48 <colinclark> That sounds like a reasonable thing to do
2013-12-10T16:24:52 <colinclark> Are you asking me to do so?
2013-12-10T16:25:25 <jessm> these are all really good points -- we\'ve got to just keep the struggle on to figure out a way to do this. oh, i wan\'t asking you to do it. i was suggesting "we" woudl do it.
2013-12-10T16:25:32 * mrvisser has quit
2013-12-10T16:25:34 <jessm> i edited the line and lost the subject
2013-12-10T16:25:37 <jessm> sorry
2013-12-10T16:26:00 <colinclark> s\'okay
2013-12-10T16:26:03 <colinclark> yes, that sounds fine
2013-12-10T16:26:10 <colinclark> I don\'t think this needs to be a struggle, or particularly difficult
2013-12-10T16:26:18 <danaayotte> just to throw a spanner in the works I wonder where "co-designing" with the broader community (with potential users) and participatory design fit in with respect to merit?
2013-12-10T16:26:48 <colinclark> That\'s a very good question
2013-12-10T16:27:09 <colinclark> my first temptation would be to say that, if anything, it helps to flatten these kinds of distinctions
2013-12-10T16:27:14 <colinclark> user vs. designer, etc.
2013-12-10T16:28:21 <colinclark> Since, presumably, users who have contributed and productively influence designs over time will, as a result, also have greater decision-making influence
2013-12-10T16:28:56 <danaayotte> yes, in which case the definition of merit changes altogether, or merit as currently defined no longer applies
2013-12-10T16:29:06 <colinclark> How so, danaayotte?
2013-12-10T16:29:31 <colinclark> I think I probably agree with you, but there has perhaps been an implicit definition of "design merit" so far
2013-12-10T16:29:44 <danaayotte> yeah - well we were discussing merit in terms of having proven oneself by making contributions
2013-12-10T16:29:57 <danaayotte> but some of us have much more access to making those contributions (so far)
2013-12-10T16:30:33 * yzen_ joined the channel
2013-12-10T16:30:55 <colinclark> Just to wrap up on our thread, jessm, the reason I don\'t think it has to be much of a struggle is that you\'ve clearly got a day-to-day working method nicely established, which is the hard part. So mostly you\'re just left with thinking through the boring and hopefully-not-very-common cases of disagreement, obstruction, incompetence, etc.
2013-12-10T16:31:08 <colinclark> danaayotte: Yes, that\'s an interesting point
2013-12-10T16:31:39 <colinclark> Presumably your constantly-refined working methods help to open up "access to contributions" as you say
2013-12-10T16:31:42 * yzen has quit
2013-12-10T16:31:42 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2013-12-10T16:31:43 <colinclark> things like your open design meetings
2013-12-10T16:31:51 <danaayotte> exactly
2013-12-10T16:31:52 <colinclark> and your tendency to talk with users \x08
2013-12-10T16:31:54 <colinclark> and so on
2013-12-10T16:32:19 <colinclark> Much like how, perhaps, the developers always offer a mentor to a potential new contributor
2013-12-10T16:32:30 <danaayotte> that\'s interesting
2013-12-10T16:32:33 <jessm> to shephard good ideas?
2013-12-10T16:33:02 <colinclark> to enable easier access to productive contribution
2013-12-10T16:33:50 <colinclark> I\'ve been wanting to establish a governance process for the GPII
2013-12-10T16:33:55 <colinclark> so this conversation is immensely helpful
2013-12-10T16:34:14 <colinclark> There is still, of course, the ever-sticky situation about how you start out
2013-12-10T16:34:23 <colinclark> i.e. who has power initially
2013-12-10T16:34:39 <colinclark> And I guess there\'s no way to avoid the fact that sometimes someone is in a position just because they started something
2013-12-10T16:34:42 <colinclark> if that makes sense
2013-12-10T16:35:03 <danaayotte> you mean they take the leadership so they get to lead?
2013-12-10T16:35:20 <danaayotte> and taking the leadership is easier for some than others?
2013-12-10T16:35:32 <colinclark> Well, I mean more pragmatically
2013-12-10T16:35:40 <colinclark> we could use me as a non-hypothetical example
2013-12-10T16:36:01 <colinclark> "How come that fucker gets to be a leader? Who nominated him for commit access?"
2013-12-10T16:37:13 <danaayotte> Well, I guess we have to start somewhere.  So those who for whatever reason have the access have the responsibility to bring others on.
2013-12-10T16:37:25 <colinclark> I was just typing literally the same sentence :) :) :)
2013-12-10T16:37:36 <danaayotte> JINX
2013-12-10T16:37:39 <danaayotte> :)
2013-12-10T16:38:48 <colinclark> Justin_o: What would you guys do if I hopped on my sailboat and sailed away? I guess we\'ve never documented this sort of thing, but presumably you\'d decide as a group of committers if you actually needed a "technical lead," and if so, vote for someone else to take the role?

2013-12-10T16:44:39 <jessm> hey everyone: i\'m on a call for edupub 2 summit and will miss standup. i\'m getting the C4A spreadsheet done and sent in today

2013-12-10T17:15:22 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-12-10T17:25:33 <jhung> I heard that cats are pretty popular around here\xe2\x80\xa6 so I\'ve been instructed to post the following link. I claim no responsibility on the reduction of productivity that may result. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22567526
2013-12-10T17:26:23 <colinclark> oh yes, this one is great
2013-12-10T17:28:45 <jhung> Justin_o and I were talking about GPS exercise trackers when the conversation turned into the idea of tracking pets with Go Pros and trackers\xe2\x80\xa6 and of course it was already done. :)
2013-12-10T17:29:31 * jhung name drops Justin_o to spread the blame
2013-12-10T17:29:55 <Justin_o> thanks jhung :)
2013-12-10T17:30:03 <jhung> anytime. :)
2013-12-10T17:31:41 <Justin_o> anastasiac, jhung: is it okay to have itemscope="itemscope" be the attribute instead of just itemscope
2013-12-10T17:33:12 <jhung> Justin_o: here\'s the explanation, but no mention if your proposed usage is okay. http://schema.org/docs/gs.html#microdata_itemscope_itemtype
2013-12-10T17:33:44 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-12-10T17:39:32 <Justin_o> jhung: hmm.. i can use jQuery prop which looks like it should work, but the output markup may be itemscope="" in ff
2013-12-10T17:42:13 <jhung> anastasiac - any thoughts on Justin_o\'s question?
2013-12-10T17:42:50 <Justin_o> hmm.. i can\'t get the prop to work.. i wonder if it has to do with our version of jQuery.. i\'m going to try with a different version
2013-12-10T17:55:43 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac: from what i can tell, jQuery will not add itemscope.. to any element. :(
2013-12-10T17:55:51 <Justin_o> using prop anyways
2013-12-10T17:56:09 <anastasiac> Justin_o: !!!
2013-12-10T17:57:39 <colinclark> michelled: So what is your Fedora 19 VM actually doing?
2013-12-10T17:57:58 <colinclark> and kasparnet, did you ever manage to create a basic testing VM for Linux?
2013-12-10T17:58:14 <jhung> Justin_o: so what alternative do we have? Try a different version of jQeury?
2013-12-10T17:58:25 <Justin_o> anastasiac, jhung: i can use attar("itemscope", "") though.. which seems analogous although on FF this doesn\'t seem to return prop("itemscope") with a true value
2013-12-10T17:58:37 <michelled> nothing, colinclark. I have a terminal window open and the onscreen keyboard. now I will blow away this VM and reimport it
2013-12-10T17:59:06 <colinclark> When you say "nothing," do you mean that the VM locks up?
2013-12-10T17:59:46 <kasparnet> michelled: ctrl+alt+f2 should generally put you in a proper terminal (not within the GUI)
2013-12-10T18:00:04 <kasparnet> in case you wanna check whether it\'s the windowmanager, the entire OS, etc
2013-12-10T18:00:39 <kasparnet> though I guess ctrl+alt+f2 isn\'t the best of shortcuts, sitting in a mac with all sorts of annoying keyboard settings applied
'

b'2013-12-10T15:14:32 <colinclark> ?
2013-12-10T15:16:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: not sure what you mean exactly.. the placeholder is markup that is styled to indicate where the video will be placed. Currently it\'s a section with a set of divs
2013-12-10T15:18:03 <colinclark> that\'s what I meant :)
2013-12-10T15:18:25 <colinclark> Should I clone the metadata repo to see this in practice?
2013-12-10T15:19:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: it\'s not in there yet, but you can grab my branch https://github.com/jobara/metadata/tree/FLOE-112
2013-12-10T15:22:21 <colinclark> Look at that...
2013-12-10T15:22:30 <colinclark> you made a PouchDBDataSource!!!
2013-12-10T15:22:43 <colinclark> Incredible
2013-12-10T15:22:52 <colinclark> Can I use this for Flocking over the holidays? :)
2013-12-10T15:23:20 <Justin_o> :) go for it.. but it\'s not fully robust yet... needs proper error handling
2013-12-10T15:23:27 <Justin_o> you\'re welcome to improve it though :0
2013-12-10T15:23:28 <Justin_o> :)
2013-12-10T15:23:45 <colinclark> :)
2013-12-10T15:23:47 <colinclark> Will do
2013-12-10T15:23:57 <colinclark> Can you point me to where your placeholder markup is, Justin_o?
2013-12-10T15:25:01 <colinclark> hey jessm
2013-12-10T15:25:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure.. it\'s in simpleEditor.js for now https://github.com/jobara/metadata/blob/FLOE-112/demos/js/simpleEditor.js#L297
2013-12-10T15:25:12 <jessm> colinclark: wassup?
2013-12-10T15:25:27 <colinclark> Do you know who maintains commit access to the design SVN repository?
2013-12-10T15:25:29 <Justin_o> colinclark:  you can also view it by adding a url at the top and clicking "OK" then click on the "View HTML" button at the bottom
2013-12-10T15:25:44 <colinclark> I was just looking at our list of current committers and realized that it might be time for us to move James and Erin to "Emerti" status :)
2013-12-10T15:25:49 <colinclark> Which I went ahead and did
2013-12-10T15:26:00 <jessm> colinclark: maintains? meaning, who has commit access or who manages it?
2013-12-10T15:26:04 <colinclark> Is it avtar who will have to actually change the access list?
2013-12-10T15:26:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think Avtar probably maintains the actual access
2013-12-10T15:26:07 <jessm> ah, yes, indeed
2013-12-10T15:26:11 <colinclark> ok
2013-12-10T15:26:31 <jessm> colinclark: we have stopped using that repo i think
2013-12-10T15:26:38 <colinclark> You\'re not using SVN any more?
2013-12-10T15:26:41 <jessm> i think we\'ve fallen back into the wiki and dropbox
2013-12-10T15:26:52 <jessm> vjoanna: is that true? ^
2013-12-10T15:27:01 <Justin_o> jessm, colinclark: time to start thinking about a DAMS again
2013-12-10T15:27:16 * jessm cries
2013-12-10T15:27:54 <vjoanna> jessm: yes, all the latest design files are on the wiki - and we share working files with dropbox
2013-12-10T15:27:55 <colinclark> In two years, once our cloud infrastructure project has been built, I\'d love to talk about a great asset management system
2013-12-10T15:28:24 <colinclark> jessm, vjoanna: If you really aren\'t going to use SVN any more, I\'d suggest telling Avtar about it
2013-12-10T15:28:33 <colinclark> and saving any files you want to preserve
2013-12-10T15:28:37 <jessm> colinclark: good idea...
2013-12-10T15:28:47 <jessm> we have some design clean-up to do methinks
2013-12-10T15:28:52 <colinclark> As for Dropbox, well, you know what I\'m going to say...
2013-12-10T15:29:08 <jessm> unsustainable
2013-12-10T15:29:09 <colinclark> Just remember the participatory and "lazy consensus" principles of our community
2013-12-10T15:29:24 <colinclark> I don\'t care what tools or services you use
2013-12-10T15:29:28 <Justin_o> colinclark: how long do we need to keep svn around if we aren\'t using it anymore? forever?
2013-12-10T15:29:53 <jessm> Justin_o: well, hold on. perhaps we *should* be using it again.
2013-12-10T15:30:03 <colinclark> I suspect we could just ditch it, were we to decide not to use it
2013-12-10T15:30:24 <jessm> we started that direction because shoving everythign into the wiki was a bad idea. and things like dropbox weren\'t open
2013-12-10T15:30:28 <jessm> vjoanna: thoughts?
2013-12-10T15:31:08 * sgithens has quit
2013-12-10T15:32:25 <Justin_o> jessm: i\'ve been of the mind that SVN may not be the right tool for designers.. and something like git certainly isn\'t due to the binary files.
2013-12-10T15:32:27 <vjoanna> jessm, colinclark: we started using dropbox because we would have had to commit a file everyday to svn to make sure we all had the latest
2013-12-10T15:32:53 <vjoanna> it became really tedious
2013-12-10T15:33:10 <jessm> true is, we haven\'t found the right tool and so we wander in and out of using them :(
2013-12-10T15:33:31 <colinclark> Probably, the simplest thing is to make sure there is a public dropbox
2013-12-10T15:33:34 <colinclark> and link to it from the wiki
2013-12-10T15:33:48 <vjoanna> sure - i could do that right now
2013-12-10T15:33:58 <colinclark> and continuing to remember that dropbox is a working space, not a "stable design" space
2013-12-10T15:34:18 <colinclark> I think that\'s a reasonable approach, at least until people start running out of space in their dropbox because of sharing this big design repository
2013-12-10T15:34:32 <colinclark> And in that case, I think we should take the time to pull anything out of SVN that we want to preserve
2013-12-10T15:34:40 <colinclark> and then make Avtar\'s day by finally getting rid of SVN
2013-12-10T15:34:44 <jessm> and vjoanna let\'s do that thing where we crawl through svn to preserve what we want and then give Avtar the ok to depracate it
2013-12-10T15:34:47 <jessm> jinx!
2013-12-10T15:34:53 <colinclark> It might actually be organization-wide, if we\'re lucky
2013-12-10T15:35:01 <vjoanna> sounds good
2013-12-10T15:35:06 <colinclark> I don\'t know for sure, but I think everyone at the IDRC might finally be done with SVN
2013-12-10T15:35:43 <colinclark> jessm, vjoanna: I guess it\'s also worth considering if there are cases where you want to preserve some history
2013-12-10T15:35:51 <colinclark> to, say, show the evolution of a design
2013-12-10T15:36:13 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think we should probably have Avtar zip us up a full copy of the repository to store somewhere for legal reasons
2013-12-10T15:36:34 <vjoanna> colinclark: usually the evolution would happen with different files
2013-12-10T15:36:44 <colinclark> right
2013-12-10T15:36:50 <colinclark> did it in the past, though?
2013-12-10T15:37:15 <vjoanna> not that i know of..
2013-12-10T15:37:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: that makes sense
2013-12-10T15:37:24 <colinclark> Justin_o: In terms of your earlier question, I think #2 probably makes the most sense
2013-12-10T15:37:50 <colinclark> again, in keeping with the notion that what the user edits is a kind of "template" that gets rendered out at view time
2013-12-10T15:38:17 <colinclark> though we will need some kind of reversibility to be more robust in the long run
2013-12-10T15:38:20 <colinclark> if that makes snese
2013-12-10T15:38:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool that\'s the option i was leaning towards.
2013-12-10T15:38:59 <colinclark> jessm: So who gets access to change a design? How is that, ultimately, governed?
2013-12-10T15:39:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: I don\'t think it will be a true template at this point, but a block of markup that get\'s replaced
2013-12-10T15:39:10 <colinclark> Will you maintain some concept of "design committers" even while working in Dropbox?
2013-12-10T15:39:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: but this should be improved over time
2013-12-10T15:39:25 <colinclark> Or will anyone be able to contribute a design or change to a design?
2013-12-10T15:39:34 * danaayotte joined the channel
2013-12-10T15:39:36 <colinclark> Justin_o: yep, that\'s why I used the quotes
2013-12-10T15:39:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool :)
2013-12-10T15:40:10 <jessm> colinclark: good question. i think it\'s that question that led us to SVN, but it\'s not the right tool. and coming up with a system of duplicate files seems silly too.
2013-12-10T15:40:28 <colinclark> A system of duplicate files?
2013-12-10T15:40:31 <jessm> i dont\' have a good answer for this. and everything seems inconvenient at best.
2013-12-10T15:41:06 <colinclark> The simplest answer, I think, is to share the Dropbox file read-only with the entire world and link to it so it is very visible
2013-12-10T15:41:07 <jessm> well, if you can\'t access versions and someone changes a file and you want the older version, presumably, if you keep one on your local drive and the editable one in dropbox or the wiki?
2013-12-10T15:41:14 <jessm> yeah
2013-12-10T15:41:16 <jessm> makes sense
2013-12-10T15:41:19 <colinclark> and to maintain a notion of a "committer" list
2013-12-10T15:41:26 <colinclark> which is the list of people who have write access to it
2013-12-10T15:41:27 <jessm> yes
2013-12-10T15:41:48 <colinclark> Though ironically, neither danaayotte nor vjoanna are on your list :)
2013-12-10T15:41:49 <colinclark> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/List+of+Current+Fluid+Committers
2013-12-10T15:42:06 <jessm> :( so long guys. no work here for you
2013-12-10T15:42:40 <jessm> we\'ve had a fairly "informal" process for granting design commit access.
2013-12-10T15:43:01 <jessm> Justin_o: do you remember how we\'ve done it in the past?
2013-12-10T15:43:32 <jessm> i\'ve followed this in the past i think: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Process+for+Granting+Commit+Access
2013-12-10T15:43:46 <jessm> but we don\'t use the committers list
2013-12-10T15:43:58 <jessm> perhaps Jon and I can just pow wow
2013-12-10T15:44:29 <Justin_o> jessm: for the design side I think it has been more "informal" i remember talking about creating a formal structure in the past, but don\'t know if anything ever actually came of it.
2013-12-10T15:44:59 <Justin_o> jessm: yes.. i\'m sure jhung would have good ideas
2013-12-10T15:45:04 <colinclark> it\'s fine for it to be informal, as long as it\'s clear
2013-12-10T15:45:19 <jessm> Justin_o: how about I send the email to fluid-work, then Jon and I do the voting offline
2013-12-10T15:45:29 <jessm> jhung: you ok with taht? ^
2013-12-10T15:45:40 <colinclark> jessm: Perhaps voting really isn\'t the solution you need
2013-12-10T15:45:48 <colinclark> especially completely invisible voting :P
2013-12-10T15:46:10 <colinclark> I encourage you to consider, if you think it\'s appropriate for your style of work, a more informal approach
2013-12-10T15:46:28 <jessm> sorry everyone. i\'ve fallend down on this. long overdue. how about nomination in IRC? I nominate vjoanna and danaayotte!
2013-12-10T15:46:44 <colinclark> lol
2013-12-10T15:46:52 <vjoanna> jessm, colinclark: added a link here to the dropbox we\'ve been using for preference tool design: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Preference+Editing+Tools+Design
2013-12-10T15:48:04 <colinclark> thanks, vjoanna
2013-12-10T15:48:14 <jessm> ok, everyone: i\'m adding vjoanna and danaayotte to the design committer list and then i\'m going back to the tangle of the C4A spreadsheets!
2013-12-10T15:48:18 <colinclark> jessm: Is it possible that we don\'t need a notion of "design committers" at all?
2013-12-10T15:48:32 <danaayotte> vjoanna are the files read-only unless we share them directly?
2013-12-10T15:48:32 <vjoanna> we\'ve been really only been using the dropbox to share small changes, files often get deleted and moved around from here - anything that we want to keep we upload to the wiki
2013-12-10T15:48:51 <jessm> colinclark: it is not only possible, it is probable
2013-12-10T15:48:52 <vjoanna> danaayotte, yep they\'re read only
2013-12-10T15:49:33 <jessm> as is evidenced by the fact that these two have been producing finalized designs for months and haven\'t been on a list
2013-12-10T15:49:49 <colinclark> Well, I\'m not convinced that is indeed evidence
2013-12-10T15:49:54 <Justin_o> jhung: i updated my FLOE-112 branch
2013-12-10T15:49:56 <colinclark> of anything other than lack of community-mindedness :P
2013-12-10T15:49:59 <Justin_o> minor change to how reset works
2013-12-10T15:50:15 <jessm> colinclark: what is evidence to you then?
2013-12-10T15:50:23 <jhung> Justin_o: thanks. FYI I\'m re-formatting the URL text field a little.
2013-12-10T15:50:40 <jessm> in dev. commit access is to ensure that the finalized work is at a certain quality, no?
2013-12-10T15:51:00 <colinclark> That\'s one aspect to it
2013-12-10T15:51:15 <colinclark> The key question is, who gets to lead and why?
2013-12-10T15:51:23 <colinclark> and how can others participate in the process
2013-12-10T15:51:45 <colinclark> So open communities, when they work well, tend to be meritocracies
2013-12-10T15:51:46 <Justin_o> jhung: you can change anything you like as long as it still works :)
2013-12-10T15:52:05 <colinclark> people who do a lot of work get recognized for their work and have an opportunity to lead the direction of the work
2013-12-10T15:52:19 <jessm> colinclark: i think we\'re accomplishing those values through the list and through meetings and through the open design mtgs. now too. i hope we are...
2013-12-10T15:52:28 <jhung> Justin_o: Oh. It needs to work? I thought it was just supposed to look nice. :D
2013-12-10T15:53:21 <Justin_o> jhung: this is when i need Bosmon to do some SHOUTING
2013-12-10T15:53:41 <colinclark> jessm: Right, so you need to be able to answer questions like, "How do I get involved in the design process?" and "What if I want to contribute a design?"
2013-12-10T15:53:50 <jhung> Justin_o: lol
2013-12-10T15:54:09 <colinclark> And "How can I help lead the direction of design?"
2013-12-10T15:54:23 <jessm> colinclark: i think we have answers for that\xe2\x80\xa6 design mtgs., list conversations, open design mtgs. now too
2013-12-10T15:54:37 <jessm> do they seem sufficient?
2013-12-10T15:54:48 <colinclark> No, since you seem unable to address this basic question
2013-12-10T15:54:58 <colinclark> Who gets to actually contribute a design?
2013-12-10T15:55:14 <colinclark> And I\'m afraid the answer is largely "they get paid by the IDRC"
2013-12-10T15:55:22 <vjoanna> jessm, colinclark: i don\'t think this dropbox is where designs get \'committed\' - i think it would be when we upload them to the wiki
2013-12-10T15:55:30 <jessm> colinclark: anyone is the answer. how it then gets vetted is where we diverge.
2013-12-10T15:55:50 <colinclark> There\'s a key issues, yes, jessm

2013-12-10T09:57:54 <sgithens> kasparnet: The login/session support is definately not happening for the pilot right?
2013-12-10T10:00:04 <kasparnet> sgithens: what kind of crazy time is this to be awake
2013-12-10T10:00:04 <kasparnet> :)
2013-12-10T10:00:27 <kasparnet> do you mean the stuff about RFIDs keeping state, etc?
2013-12-10T10:00:37 <kasparnet> (having the flowmanager do it instead)
2013-12-10T10:00:54 <sgithens> kasparnet: Yes, that
2013-12-10T10:00:59 <sgithens> I was awake
2013-12-10T10:01:08 <sgithens> I'll go to Ashtanga in 70 minutes
2013-12-10T10:01:16 <sgithens> and then to campus :p
2013-12-10T10:01:18 <kasparnet> sgithens: did you sleep at all?
2013-12-10T10:01:21 <sgithens> I did
2013-12-10T10:01:25 <sgithens> for like 5 hours!
2013-12-10T10:01:28 <sgithens> it was great
2013-12-10T10:01:31 <kasparnet> ... that's crazy
2013-12-10T10:01:46 <kasparnet> and I actually think that Yura _has_ added support for it
2013-12-10T10:02:00 <kasparnet> if you use something like: http://localhost:8081/user/<token>
2013-12-10T10:02:06 <kasparnet> that'll do the appropriate action
2013-12-10T10:02:09 <sgithens> but, while I'm cleaning up RFID stuff, and about to write emails about RFID tags I suddenly realized they are not going to have to do that eventually
2013-12-10T10:02:21 <sgithens> *but* we have the pilots first
2013-12-10T10:02:28 <sgithens> and what should they do for the pilots
2013-12-10T10:02:39 <sgithens> that's actually pretty awesome
2013-12-10T10:02:41 <sgithens> that URL
2013-12-10T10:02:46 <sgithens> you just tap it
2013-12-10T10:02:51 <sgithens> and you don't have to specify any action
2013-12-10T10:02:53 <sgithens> that's nice
2013-12-10T10:03:01 <kasparnet> did you just try it out?
2013-12-10T10:03:04 <sgithens> no
2013-12-10T10:03:07 <sgithens> just mentally :p
2013-12-10T10:03:21 <kasparnet> haha - I should probably double check that that's the correct URL
2013-12-10T10:03:52 <sgithens> ok, so thats in
2013-12-10T10:04:14 <sgithens> do you think that's what we'll roll for the 23rd pilot deadline.  If you don't know right this second that's cool :p
2013-12-10T10:04:39 <sgithens> just need to know this week sometime to adjust the rfid listeners
2013-12-10T10:05:03 <kasparnet> sgithens: I'm generally into keeping things as simple as possible for the pilots - so having them hold their own state for the pilots is fine
2013-12-10T10:05:27 <kasparnet> sgithens: unless of course you feel it's just as easy, or less error prone, or something ... then removing state is fine
2013-12-10T10:05:46 <kasparnet> sgithens: but it's not a priority for the pilots
2013-12-10T10:06:26 <sgithens> well, I guess if the flowmanager code is untested, that would be more error prone if it's not tested.  But from a listeners perspective... it's easier to just always hit the same URL rather than keep logic around to keep track of it
2013-12-10T10:07:07 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-12-10T10:07:11 <sgithens> it reduces the rfid listener code to just working on the timing so it feels natural when you tap it
2013-12-10T10:09:02 <kasparnet> sgithens: ok - my own repo is screwed right now as I'm working on a JIRA - but will check whether the new URL works asap - then let you know
2013-12-10T10:09:26 <kasparnet> sgithens: it's the yzen who's been fixing the flowmanager, so I'm pretty sure there are unit tests for it
2013-12-10T10:11:31 <sgithens> kasparnet: Cool. I've got the nfcpy library jhernandez recommended working (with a few caveats).  It might not be ready to replace the old one for the pilots, but it's slick.  The take home message, it's basically *another* listener, so if I can just do this one from scratch correctly and leave out the flow state that would be awesome
2013-12-10T10:11:47 * mrvisser has quit
2013-12-10T10:12:11 <kasparnet> sgithens: Awesome!!
2013-12-10T10:19:09 <kasparnet> sgithens: ok - just tried the URL - and it doesn't work
2013-12-10T10:20:09 <sgithens> ha
2013-12-10T10:35:28 <sgithens> kasparnet: Man, why can't I find the android list archives. google fail
2013-12-10T10:35:34 <sgithens> I thought I responded to that as well
2013-12-10T10:36:30 <kasparnet> sgithens: the android list is @cloud4all.info
2013-12-10T10:36:44 <kasparnet> which is non-public and non-logged
2013-12-10T10:36:50 <sgithens> kasparnet: Righg, but... fuck for real?
2013-12-10T10:36:57 <kasparnet> sgithens: haha, I know
2013-12-10T10:37:01 <sgithens> I can't go look at the archives?
2013-12-10T10:37:03 <kasparnet> sgithens: but you might very well have replied to it
2013-12-10T10:37:50 <sgithens> some of the GPII lists for some reason don't send me a copy when I email things, even though I set the option to always send me a copy, so sometimes I like to look at the archive
2013-12-10T10:37:55 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-12-10T10:38:06 <sgithens> We really can't see the mailman (or whatever) archives for cloud4all?
2013-12-10T10:38:14 <sgithens> We should stop using that list
2013-12-10T10:38:17 <kasparnet> sgithens: nope, not to my knowledge
2013-12-10T10:38:22 <kasparnet> sgithens: yeah, I know
2013-12-10T10:38:25 <sgithens> at least for development work
2013-12-10T10:38:32 <sgithens> development as in coding
2013-12-10T10:42:58 * mrvisser has quit
2013-12-10T10:43:50 <sgithens> kasparnet: mini rant sent, time to head off for ashtanga

2013-12-10T14:10:26 <Justin_o> cindyli: in the editor? in the sidebar? or should we integrate with each panel?
2013-12-10T14:10:43 <cindyli> thanks, jhung.
2013-12-10T14:11:33 <cindyli> Justin_o: editor or sidebar. if sidebar is going to be part of editor. probably better to use editor
2013-12-10T14:11:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: it's a good question
2013-12-10T14:12:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. lets do the integration as part of FLOE-125, which is the sidebar work
2013-12-10T14:13:02 <cindyli> sounds good, Justin_o

2013-12-10T14:20:20 <Justin_o> jhung: can you work on the styling of this branch https://github.com/jobara/metadata/tree/FLOE-112
2013-12-10T14:20:52 <Justin_o> jhung: Just so you know, there is a limitation where you can only add a single video, and once it's been added you can't really remove it.. although you can remove the placeholder...
2013-12-10T14:21:18 <Justin_o> if you want to remove it, you need to restart the demo
2013-12-10T14:21:42 <jhung> Justin_o:  thanks. I'll take a look.

2013-12-10T15:13:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: I was talking to cindyli earlier about how to best handle converting the placeholder for a video in the editor to actual markup in the markup view. 1) when we can transform the placeholder on save and fetch so that the placeholder is not persisted. We will have to put it back in when we fetch the contents for the editor though. 2) we transform on
2013-12-10T15:13:45 <Justin_o> the markup view side.. so we persist the placeholder and construct the real markup when we view it.
2013-12-10T15:13:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: what do you think of those ideas, or maybe you have some other suggestion
2013-12-10T15:14:32 <colinclark> What's the nature of the placeholder
