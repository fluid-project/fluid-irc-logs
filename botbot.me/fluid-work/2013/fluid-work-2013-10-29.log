2013-10-29T17:52:55 <clown> jhernandez:  this looks promising \xe2\x80\x94 a way to run shell scripts from within node.js:  http://www.2ality.com/2011/12/nodejs-shell-scripting.html
2013-10-29T17:53:18 <clown> maybe this is old news to you.

2013-10-29T17:57:27 <jhernandez> I know all these tips
2013-10-29T17:58:09 <jhernandez> in fact, we use some of them in GPII

2013-10-29T18:31:56 <jhernandez> regarding android, I\'m integrating my prototype into GPII\'s android app code
2013-10-29T18:32:12 <jhernandez> http://snag.gy/OCr8n.jpg
2013-10-29T18:32:22 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-29T18:32:43 <jhernandez> and, regarding node os related stuff
2013-10-29T18:32:55 <jhernandez> ie: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleActions/src/LifecycleActions.js
2013-10-29T18:33:17 <jhernandez> we make a wrapper for child_process.spawn
2013-10-29T18:34:18 <jhernandez> ie2: https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/node_modules/orca/orcaSettingsHandler.js
2013-10-29T18:34:49 <jhernandez> there you\'ll find examples of readFileSync, writeFileSync, and IIRC, some operation with paths

2013-10-29T19:43:47 <anastasiac> cindyli1, Justin_o, I have a question about the new string handling. Which one of you should I ask?
2013-10-29T19:49:48 <colinclark> oh hey jhernandez, are you still around?
2013-10-29T19:54:54 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli1
2013-10-29T19:55:13 <Bosmon> Did you have ideas about the modelRelay work?
2013-10-29T19:55:16 <cindyli1> hi Bosmon
2013-10-29T19:58:53 <cindyli1> yes, Bosmon. anastasiac, Justin_o and i talked about it and agreed modelRelay should be the way to go. but since with model relay, the internal path "value" needs to be specified in rules. so this change can wait until the model relay goes into the framework. I\'m going to close my pull request. what do you think?
2013-10-29T20:02:23 <jhernandez> colinclark: yeah
2013-10-29T20:02:35 <colinclark> I just thought of a question for you
2013-10-29T20:02:43 <colinclark> We were chatting with kasparnet yesterday
2013-10-29T20:02:57 <colinclark> about how we can a) make master more stable and b) cut releases much more frequently
2013-10-29T20:03:08 <colinclark> since we seem to struggle to cut releases at all :)
2013-10-29T20:03:34 <colinclark> jhernandez: Do you think there might be some way that we could distribute a VM with an emulator or something running Android on it?
2013-10-29T20:03:49 <jhernandez> mmm
2013-10-29T20:03:59 <colinclark> kasparnet is in the midst of creating pre-built VirtualBox VMs for both Windows and Linux for quick testing
2013-10-29T20:04:09 <jhernandez> what about just providing the apk ant the js.tar.gz?
2013-10-29T20:04:11 <colinclark> if the acceptance tests pass there, you\'ve got some reasonable indication that the system works
2013-10-29T20:04:25 <colinclark> jhernandez: That\'s better than nothing, yes
2013-10-29T20:04:56 <colinclark> And then it\'d be as simple as an "adb install" and an "adb push"
2013-10-29T20:05:01 * thealphanerd has quit
2013-10-29T20:05:06 <jhernandez> yes, but the point is that we would like to run it as a prvivileged app, into a rooted phone
2013-10-29T20:05:24 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-29T20:05:29 <colinclark> which is why a VM or something would be great
2013-10-29T20:05:34 <jhernandez> yup
2013-10-29T20:05:54 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - what about the idea of using your own modelRelay for this implementation?
2013-10-29T20:06:01 <jhernandez> but, the only way could be by providing a system image to run in an android emulator
2013-10-29T20:06:15 <jhernandez> but, not sure about the complexity of doing that
2013-10-29T20:06:19 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2013-10-29T20:06:27 <colinclark> I can do a bit of research
2013-10-29T20:07:30 <jhernandez> aaand, about the linux image, it\'s ok, but we can use our fedora repos to create a spin with it
2013-10-29T20:07:41 <jhernandez> it == the GPII packages
2013-10-29T20:08:34 <jhernandez> no VMs, just grab the iso, flash  into an USB drive, and boot your computer with it
2013-10-29T20:10:29 <cindyli1> Bosmon: the goal of the jira is to get rid of the fact that text field slider requires a model path named "value". if this cannot be achieved, it\'s not a rush to change it. i can certainly use my own model relay. not a big change anyway
2013-10-29T20:10:34 <jhernandez> VMs suck at graphics rendering stuff, you have to deal with USB ports to use them, and/or with the sound output from the VM
2013-10-29T20:11:09 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-29T20:11:13 <colinclark> they do generally suck
2013-10-29T20:11:29 <colinclark> that seems reasonable, too
2013-10-29T20:11:35 <colinclark> jhernandez: is it difficult to do?
2013-10-29T20:11:50 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - surely the goal is to avoid EXPOSING the fact that the textfieldSlider requires a model path named "value" .......
2013-10-29T20:12:06 <jhernandez> colinclark: I can quickly draft up the steps to address this
2013-10-29T20:12:22 <colinclark> I\'d be curious
2013-10-29T20:15:33 <cindyli1> Bosmon: with model relay, "value" is not exposed if integrators are using fluid.prefs.textfieldSlider, but if fluid.textfieldSlider component is directly used, the "value" path is required.
2013-10-29T20:15:54 <cindyli1> i think 5190 is to solve the latter
2013-10-29T20:15:55 <cindyli1> Bosmon: btw, your comments for https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/425 has been address and ready for another round of review.
2013-10-29T20:16:35 <jhernandez> colinclark: Every time we want to create a new spin with the latest code we should:
2013-10-29T20:16:38 <jhernandez> 1.- Update GPII (and related) packages in GPII:Factory repo with the latest code from Github
2013-10-29T20:16:41 <jhernandez> 2.- Once the packages are updated, publish a new version of the GPII:Factory repo
2013-10-29T20:16:44 <jhernandez> 3.- Run a script to build the iso (this script will be done once, and reused every time we want to re-spin)
2013-10-29T20:16:47 <jhernandez> 4.- After tesing the new ISO, Put the image somewhere and available to be downloaded
2013-10-29T20:17:57 <jhernandez> btw, with GPII:Factory I\'m talking about -> https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:javihernandez:GPII:Factory
2013-10-29T20:18:38 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - thanks for looking at that one, and also for your test case, which looks valid
2013-10-29T20:18:50 <Bosmon> Could you work around the "*" issue for now, by replacing the "*" with ""fluid.prefs.enactors" ?
2013-10-29T20:18:54 <Bosmon> I think it would be more correct anyway
2013-10-29T20:19:19 <colinclark> jhernandez: How does one do #1?
2013-10-29T20:19:21 <Bosmon> You really only want to hit enactor subcomponents, not any others that might appear there
2013-10-29T20:20:16 * cindyli1 has quit
2013-10-29T20:20:34 <jhernandez> colinclark: you can do it manually from the OBS\'s web interface, or (my preferred) use the commandline in a svn-like way
2013-10-29T20:21:07 <jhernandez> OBS it\'s something similar to github, but for packages
2013-10-29T20:22:28 <jhernandez> you can branch packages from projects, you can create pull-requests (aka: submit-request) back, etc
2013-10-29T20:23:19 <jhernandez> #2 is easy, set the repo\'s publish flag to on
2013-10-29T20:23:34 <jhernandez> #3 run a script and wait
2013-10-29T20:24:25 <jhernandez> and when we want to freeze a release, we just branch Factory as GPII:STABLE:0.x
2013-10-29T20:24:33 <colinclark> interesting
2013-10-29T20:24:41 <colinclark> Do you need particular credentials?
2013-10-29T20:24:48 <colinclark> And is that something that we can share, for example?
2013-10-29T20:24:55 <jhernandez> it\'s like github
2013-10-29T20:24:57 <jhernandez> it\'s public
2013-10-29T20:25:26 <jhernandez> you can fork the code (aka: packages), create sr\'s, etc ...
2013-10-29T20:26:04 <jhernandez> the funny thing, is that you can build the packages locally before commiting anything
2013-10-29T20:26:39 <colinclark> ah, cool
2013-10-29T20:26:39 <jhernandez> and every time you make a commit, a build will be triggered on the obs
2013-10-29T20:27:13 <jhernandez> you can also add services, ie: to listen to git commits, or tarballs, or more events

2013-10-29T20:28:31 <Bosmon> I pasted some comments from whilst you were away onto the pull request : P
2013-10-29T20:28:39 <cindyli> oh
2013-10-29T20:29:23 <jhernandez> colinclark: this is the opensuse\'s running instance of the OBS https://build.opensuse.org/. But you can also grab the OBS code, and run your own instance of the OBS
2013-10-29T20:29:45 <colinclark> aha, interesting

2013-10-29T20:34:33 <jhernandez> anyway, the "rpm packages" thing is something that I\'m trying to not to do by mysef, but a colleague from emergya
2013-10-29T20:36:21 <jhernandez> i have to teach him about how to make it, but once he does it the first time, it\'s an easy and repetitive task

2013-10-29T14:13:53 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-29T14:14:49 <colinclark> So we could update it at some point without much trouble, yzen?
2013-10-29T14:14:58 <colinclark> nice URL-escaped JSON, by the way :)
2013-10-29T14:15:00 <yzen> correct

2013-10-29T14:51:51 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: anything else that we might need to for GPII.. I want to do another upgrade to the prefsEditor repo..
2013-10-29T14:53:08 <cindyli> nothing else from my side, Justin_o
2013-10-29T14:54:26 <anastasiac> can\'t think of anything, Justin_o
2013-10-29T14:54:38 <Justin_o> great thanks
2013-10-29T14:56:19 <anastasiac> cindyli, nit-picky question: I notice we\'ve renamed fluid.prefs.panels to fluid.prefs.panel, but we didn\'t make a comparable change to fluid.prefs.enactors? (not that I\'m looking forward to another sweeping namespace change!!)

2013-10-29T16:14:14 <clown> jhernandez:  do you time for a quick question?
2013-10-29T16:22:52 <jhernandez> clown: sure!
2013-10-29T16:25:46 <clown> just a quick question, jhernandez:  did you see my pull request?  *looking up url*
2013-10-29T16:25:59 <jhernandez> of course
2013-10-29T16:26:00 <clown> https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/pull/3/files
2013-10-29T16:26:11 <clown> good!
2013-10-29T16:26:20 <clown> I imagine you are very busy with the pilot stuff.
2013-10-29T16:26:20 <jhernandez> didn\'t get the chance to review it
2013-10-29T16:26:31 <jhernandez> yes
2013-10-29T16:26:41 <clown> that\'s fine.  I wanted to make sure you got the email.
2013-10-29T16:26:48 <jhernandez> yes
2013-10-29T16:26:56 <jhernandez> and thanks, btw
2013-10-29T16:26:59 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-29T16:27:21 <clown> cool.  the email did not go missing.  All right, when you get a chance\xe2\x80\xa6.  Thanks.
2013-10-29T16:27:21 <jhernandez> it\'s a great improvement
2013-10-29T16:27:38 <clown> still needs work, though (I\'m not satisfied).
2013-10-29T16:27:44 <clown> but it\'s a start.
2013-10-29T16:28:23 <jhernandez> yes
2013-10-29T16:29:22 <jhernandez> we\'re making little progresses, but with a lot of them, we\'ll end up with a big one
2013-10-29T16:29:25 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-29T16:29:59 <clown> yes.  incremental development.  :-)
2013-10-29T16:32:54 <jhernandez> yeah
2013-10-29T16:32:55 <jhernandez> and
2013-10-29T16:33:34 <jhernandez> in terms of device reporting, we can start thinking on different ones
2013-10-29T16:34:03 <jhernandez> ie, looking for manually installed software
2013-10-29T16:34:13 <jhernandez> sounds funny, isn\'t it?
2013-10-29T16:34:14 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-29T16:35:12 * michelled joined the channel
2013-10-29T16:35:23 <jhernandez> the funny thing is, look for an installed software which was installed without the package manager
2013-10-29T16:37:20 <jhernandez> ie: looking for a well-known binary, under one of the paths from PATH environmental variable
2013-10-29T17:06:54 <clown> jhernandez:  sorry, I had to step away.  *catching up*
2013-10-29T17:07:30 <jhernandez> np
2013-10-29T17:07:50 * clown tries that scenario (looking for a package installed by yum, not by packagekit).
2013-10-29T17:07:50 <jhernandez> I\'m playing with android\'d GPII UI
2013-10-29T17:08:01 <jhernandez> (busy)
2013-10-29T17:08:44 <jhernandez> clown: well, by without package manager, I was meaning not installed by yum
2013-10-29T17:08:46 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-29T17:10:03 <clown> oh\xe2\x80\xa6  installed "manually" then?  Like when I clone, build, and install accerciser?
2013-10-29T17:11:53 <jhernandez> clown: got it! :)
2013-10-29T17:13:39 <clown> jhernandez:  something to think about, then.  How to handle that case.  Hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6.
2013-10-29T17:13:45 * clown steam comes out of clown\'s ears.
2013-10-29T17:14:00 <jhernandez> xDD
2013-10-29T17:14:22 <jhernandez> yeah, maybe looking for the well-known binary in differnt well-known OS\'s paths
2013-10-29T17:19:59 <clown> yeah.
2013-10-29T17:20:27 * clown wonders if well-known paths are the same across different linux desktop distros.  Also about GNOME vs. KDE.
2013-10-29T17:22:58 <jhernandez> clown: PATH environmental variable sounds cross-distro enough to you? ;)
2013-10-29T17:23:18 <jhernandez> echo $PATH
2013-10-29T17:23:20 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-29T17:23:36 <clown> jherenandez, yup.  Also, "which" is your friend, e.g., "which accerciser".
2013-10-29T17:23:42 <jhernandez> well, another way is by using which
2013-10-29T17:23:49 <jhernandez> of course!
2013-10-29T17:24:03 <jhernandez> you were faster than me!
2013-10-29T17:24:32 <jhernandez> but yes, "which" command looks for the given binary in system\'s PATH
2013-10-29T17:27:27 <clown> true...
2013-10-29T17:27:41 <clown> well, there\'s always  "find".  Whoo hoo!
2013-10-29T17:30:30 * jhernandez loves find|grep
2013-10-29T17:37:03 * clown notes that many commands have a "--version" option for determining the version (if found).
2013-10-29T17:39:30 <jhernandez> nice catch!
2013-10-29T17:40:45 <clown> jhernandez:  alas, accerciser does not support  \xe2\x80\x94version.  Odd.  But not really all that important.
2013-10-29T17:41:45 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2013-10-29T17:41:50 <jhernandez> sorry for that
2013-10-29T17:41:51 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-29T17:42:08 <jhernandez> I think it never had this commandline option
2013-10-29T17:42:34 <clown> jhernandez:  do a "man accerciser".  For fun...
2013-10-29T17:43:04 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2013-10-29T17:43:25 <jhernandez> then I should review the commits log
2013-10-29T17:43:32 <clown> however, in general, for apps that do support \'version\' option, it (nicely) does not actually launch the program, it merely returns the version number and exits.
2013-10-29T17:43:43 <jhernandez> yup
