2013-10-28T23:42:02 <sgithens> It's completely awesome :)
2013-10-28T23:42:26 <jhernandez> just trying to do my best
2013-10-28T23:42:28 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-28T23:43:22 <jhernandez> in fact, the ALSA one, it's just a short-term solution
2013-10-28T23:44:14 <jhernandez> I'd like to use a node.js port of pulseaudio, so we will be able to deal with app's volume levels, separately

b'2013-10-28T19:05:45 <cindyli> anastasiac: are you using schema version?
2013-10-28T19:06:02 <anastasiac> cindyli, yes, for now. I will also do this (eventually) with grades
2013-10-28T19:07:49 <anastasiac> cindyli, is there some reasonably simple way for me to specify the path for the iFrame template only?
2013-10-28T19:08:02 <cindyli> anastasiac: there\'s one place that the path to a custom template can be specified but not sure if you would be completely happy with that. For the composite panel - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/StarterSchemas.js#L156
2013-10-28T19:08:46 <anastasiac> cindyli, isn\'t that the template for the container of a group?
2013-10-28T19:09:33 <cindyli> yes, the group panel in my understanding is our so-call parent composite panel
2013-10-28T19:09:55 <cindyli> for the regular or subpanel, to specify its own template: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/StarterSchemas.js#L149
2013-10-28T19:10:10 <anastasiac> cindyli, the only thing I\'m having trouble loading is SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.html
2013-10-28T19:10:29 <anastasiac> it\'s looking for that file in my folder, the one I specified with the templatePrefix property
2013-10-28T19:10:32 <cindyli> ah. ok. digging...
2013-10-28T19:17:50 * yzen joined the channel
2013-10-28T19:20:18 <cindyli> anastasiac: seems the path to iframe currently is not surfaced up by builder. It would be a deep nesting block to access it by passing in an option to the constructed prefsEditor grade. need a jira for it. which way do you think is more preferrable for integrators to supply this path? defining it in the aux schema, or as an option to the constructed grade.
2013-10-28T19:20:30 <cindyli> hi Bosmon2
2013-10-28T19:21:44 <anastasiac> cindyli, good question. hm\xe2\x80\xa6 My first response is better in the schema. Just about everything is in the schema, so that feels more natural. But further thought might expose flaws in that logic, I didn\'t really think about it, it\'s just my first reaction
2013-10-28T19:22:33 <anastasiac> also, cindyli, I think I\'ve run into a bug in the composite stuff. I\'m trying to have two composite panels, and the assembled selectors are getting confused. Maybe when you have a minute, you could come look at what I\'m seeing?
2013-10-28T19:22:59 <cindyli> coming, anastasiac.

2013-10-28T19:28:08 <Justin_o> yzen: can you please take a look at my gpii/prefsEditor pull request when you have a chance. https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/8 We\'d like to use this updated version when we update chris and alex\'s pull requests.
2013-10-28T19:28:54 <anastasiac> ok, cindyli, my test code is on its way via email
2013-10-28T19:29:31 <cindyli> awesome. thanks, anastasiac
2013-10-28T19:42:38 <jhernandez> colinclark: building android/master from scratch, I\'ve found an issue with the jtar thing
2013-10-28T19:44:31 <colinclark> cool
2013-10-28T19:44:35 <colinclark> you saw the same thing as me, perhaps?
2013-10-28T19:44:45 <colinclark> hey jhernandez, have you been talking to the TP Vision folks recently?
2013-10-28T19:45:23 <jhernandez> the "source ./prebuild.sh" complained about it (can\'t create app/libs)
2013-10-28T19:46:12 <jhernandez> so if you continue with the build, it won\'t build because it doesn\'t find the jtar tarball
2013-10-28T19:46:17 <jhernandez> annnd
2013-10-28T19:46:35 <jhernandez> about TPVision ...
2013-10-28T19:47:11 <jhernandez> nope, I pinged him by skype last week but got no response from him
2013-10-28T19:47:20 <jhernandez> this is on my android-related TODO list
2013-10-28T19:47:38 <jhernandez> what do you need from them?=
2013-10-28T19:49:35 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the build site demo of UIOptions has a problem with the links controls panel: the inputsLarger template isn\'t loading (an error in the console)
2013-10-28T19:49:43 <anastasiac> not found
2013-10-28T19:51:17 <Justin_o> anastasiac: :(
2013-10-28T19:51:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: could you please file a jira for that
2013-10-28T19:51:32 <anastasiac> sorry :-/
2013-10-28T19:51:38 <anastasiac> will do, Justin_o
2013-10-28T19:51:41 <Justin_o> thnaks
2013-10-28T19:51:45 <Justin_o> thanks
2013-10-28T19:51:52 <Justin_o> sorry having trouble typing \'a\'
2013-10-28T19:52:01 <anastasiac> odd, Justin_o: I checked out  master this morning, and it works locally...
2013-10-28T19:53:25 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s strange
2013-10-28T19:54:28 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you still want me to file it?
2013-10-28T19:54:31 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i see what the problem is
2013-10-28T19:54:43 <Justin_o> there\'s a typo on the file name.. using  a lower case p instead of P
2013-10-28T19:55:01 <anastasiac> ah, and my computer doesn\'t care
2013-10-28T19:55:41 <anastasiac> Justin_o, should I file it? or would you or cindy just make the change in your next pull request?
2013-10-28T19:56:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: did you mind to file it? if you want to fix it right away i\'ll merge it in
2013-10-28T19:56:48 <anastasiac> np, I\'ll file it and issue a pull request
2013-10-28T19:57:24 <anastasiac> FYI, Justin_o, I\'ve also files an improvement request: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5195  I could submit a pull request for that, too
2013-10-28T19:58:46 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sure, thanks
2013-10-28T20:03:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: the gpii/prefsEditor repo has been updated with the latest infusion and the updated Exploration Tool
2013-10-28T20:03:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: We should use this now to update Chris and Alex\'s code
2013-10-28T20:03:35 <cindyli> super, Justin_o
2013-10-28T20:04:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you want me to try to merge it into my branch?
2013-10-28T20:04:30 <cindyli> yes if it\'s not too much trouble, Justin_o
2013-10-28T20:06:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: no problem

2013-10-28T23:26:56 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-28T23:27:21 <jhernandez> no problem about the mails
2013-10-28T23:27:22 <sgithens> What\'s happening
2013-10-28T23:28:02 <jhernandez> I haven\'t checked your latest commits to gpii/android
2013-10-28T23:28:19 <jhernandez> now I am checking it, and we\'re still having 2 problems
2013-10-28T23:28:26 <sgithens> All I did was merge GPII-120 and your readme and path
2013-10-28T23:28:34 <sgithens> Yeah, actually I found an issue while helping colin too
2013-10-28T23:28:40 <jhernandez> yes!
2013-10-28T23:28:49 <sgithens> Which ones did you find?
2013-10-28T23:28:49 <jhernandez> one is the jtar damn thing
2013-10-28T23:28:50 <sgithens> :)
2013-10-28T23:29:04 <sgithens> I had to add in a thing to make the directory
2013-10-28T23:29:14 <sgithens> because the libs dir wasn\'t checked in or created
2013-10-28T23:29:16 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/android/pull/5
2013-10-28T23:29:21 <sgithens> so the \'cp\' command was failing
2013-10-28T23:29:40 <sgithens> hahhaha
2013-10-28T23:29:44 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-28T23:29:45 <sgithens> yup
2013-10-28T23:29:52 <sgithens> what was the other issue?
2013-10-28T23:29:57 <jhernandez> the other was with our config
2013-10-28T23:30:02 <sgithens> ah yes
2013-10-28T23:30:10 <jhernandez> we\'re missing this one -> https://github.com/GPII/android/commit/98d2122768a44809af964c5557e9e19e7e641c46
2013-10-28T23:30:26 <sgithens> aha!
2013-10-28T23:30:29 <sgithens> thanks
2013-10-28T23:30:35 <sgithens> I missed that
2013-10-28T23:30:55 <jhernandez> you can add my repo, cherry-pick this commit, and put it into master
2013-10-28T23:31:05 <sgithens> I\'ll try to get both those in before I leave.  I\'m flying to Cali in the morning and will be there until Sunday
2013-10-28T23:31:17 <jhernandez> in fact, it\'s already into v0.2 branch
2013-10-28T23:31:33 <jhernandez> wow, ok ok
2013-10-28T23:31:36 <jhernandez> no problem
2013-10-28T23:31:56 <sgithens> for a tissue bank even on Saturday.  I hope to get some GPII hacking in, not sure how much though.
2013-10-28T23:31:56 <sgithens> But I\'ll get those 2 simple things merged in
2013-10-28T23:32:15 <jhernandez> thanks!
2013-10-28T23:33:08 <sgithens> Thank you, for driving everything forward!
2013-10-28T23:33:32 <jhernandez> anyway, when you have time, I\'d like to talk to you about one of my pull request that I mention in the mail from saturday
2013-10-28T23:33:43 <jhernandez> heh, my pleasure!
2013-10-28T23:34:01 <sgithens> which number was it?
2013-10-28T23:34:28 <jhernandez> actually, this one https://github.com/GPII/android/pull/4
2013-10-28T23:35:33 <jhernandez> my doubt about the implementation is simple
2013-10-28T23:35:33 <sgithens> I\'m afraid to open thunder-bird, because it always destroys my wireless connection, I think because of how many requests it tries to make on opening
2013-10-28T23:35:45 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-28T23:35:48 <jhernandez> no problem
2013-10-28T23:36:04 <jhernandez> all the stuff is on the pull request I\'ve just pasted
2013-10-28T23:36:42 <jhernandez> basically, my question is about the implementation
2013-10-28T23:37:07 <jhernandez> I\'ve moved your AndroidFontSettings java code into a separate folder
2013-10-28T23:37:38 <jhernandez> aand, about how I am extending the activity_manager.js source code
2013-10-28T23:38:19 <jhernandez> I was wondering if we should split some of that source code into separate modules
2013-10-28T23:38:57 <jhernandez> and keep the activity_manager.js source code
2013-10-28T23:39:10 <jhernandez> clean
2013-10-28T23:40:02 <sgithens> aha
2013-10-28T23:40:22 <sgithens> I\'ll take a looksy
2013-10-28T23:40:34 <jhernandez> thanks!
2013-10-28T23:40:50 <sgithens> It\'s so wierd, because of the way their (androids) API\'s are, we might not be able to completely separate those things
2013-10-28T23:41:28 <sgithens> Also, I feel like you are a roll, you pump out like a new settings handler backend every other day

2013-10-28T14:34:46 <anastasiac> cindyli and Justin_o, I\'m starting to look at documenting the composite panel work (which I see has been merged into master - yay!). I\'m wondering if you two have a moment to chat about my initial thoughts
2013-10-28T14:36:12 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sure, whenever you\'d like
2013-10-28T14:36:29 <anastasiac> cindyli, do you have a minute now?
2013-10-28T14:37:28 <anastasiac> ah, she\'s not at her desk right now :-)

2013-10-28T14:47:06 <anastasiac> Justin_o and cindyli: The prefs framework message bundles contain strings that are apparently associated with the icons at the ends of the sliders. Are these strings supposed to be rendered into the markup in some way?
2013-10-28T14:52:44 <anastasiac> Justin_o and cindyli: The textfieldSlider has been promoted to its own component, and it\'s a viewComponent, but it doesn\'t "come with" its own default HTML template. I wonder if it should?
2013-10-28T14:52:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: can you paste in an example
2013-10-28T15:24:31 * amilchev has left the channel
2013-10-28T15:31:37 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-10-28T15:33:50 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli, I\'m re-thinking the idea of textfieldSlider having its own template. I checked all of our other components, and none of them \xe2\x80\x93 save Uploader and ToC \xe2\x80\x93 have their own templates.
2013-10-28T15:34:06 <cindyli> ah ha
2013-10-28T15:34:26 <anastasiac> and I\'ve filed the string issue and added it to the iteration page: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5192
2013-10-28T15:34:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yah.. we\'re pretty inconsistent eh.. i guess we\'ll figure that out for 2.0
2013-10-28T15:34:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac:  thanks
2013-10-28T15:36:05 <colinclark> Hey jhernandez, are you around?
2013-10-28T15:57:40 <jhernandez> colinclark: sure!
2013-10-28T15:58:14 <jhernandez> I\'ve heard that you were not able to build the android thing
2013-10-28T15:59:08 <colinclark> It built fine, yes
2013-10-28T15:59:12 <colinclark> I had trouble running it
2013-10-28T15:59:16 <jhernandez> oh
2013-10-28T15:59:17 <colinclark> I was hoping we could talk it through sometime soon
2013-10-28T15:59:29 <jhernandez> of course
2013-10-28T15:59:32 <colinclark> It failed silently while starting up Anode, I think
2013-10-28T15:59:37 <colinclark> I saw the GPII intent
2013-10-28T15:59:40 <colinclark> but no server running
2013-10-28T15:59:50 <jhernandez> hmmm
2013-10-28T16:00:29 <colinclark> I was so close! :)
2013-10-28T16:00:45 <jhernandez> it\'s true that sometimes it doesn\'t starts properly, and you have to check for it
2013-10-28T16:01:30 <jhernandez> either by looking at logcat, where you can see our beloved "Kettle Server is running on port: 8081" message
2013-10-28T16:02:34 <jhernandez> or by directly ask the system if he\'s listening on port 8081 (netstat command)
2013-10-28T16:04:04 <jhernandez> so I\'m pretty sure that it should run well on your device
2013-10-28T16:05:30 <jhernandez> anyway, any error will be raised on the logcat, so you will probably can see there if something is fucky [1]

2013-10-28T16:16:14 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-28T16:16:49 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-28T16:20:35 <colinclark> :) :)
2013-10-28T16:20:59 <colinclark> jhernandez: I did look log cat the output of starting up the app, and it didn\'t give me any obvious failure messages
2013-10-28T16:21:00 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-28T16:21:46 <colinclark> This was the log I received at the time: http://pastie.org/8422872
2013-10-28T16:21:58 <colinclark> I can try to rebuild and push it again and let you know what happens if that helps, jhernandez
2013-10-28T16:25:42 <jhernandez> hmm
2013-10-28T16:25:46 <jhernandez> colinclark: it should work
2013-10-28T16:25:53 <colinclark> :)
2013-10-28T16:26:35 <jhernandez> usually, after "V/bridge-core( 3544): Env::~Env(): ret, this=0x738b7c30" you should start seeing our gpii\'s start lines
2013-10-28T16:27:40 <jhernandez> as a quick test, start it, and if you don\'t see these lines on the logcat, start again
2013-10-28T16:27:44 <jhernandez> oh!
2013-10-28T16:28:16 <jhernandez> and I forget to say that, IIRC, on the instructions there is an importan phrase
2013-10-28T16:28:55 <jhernandez> which says: "Take into account that the first time running, you need to manually start the GPII activity. ( This will be fixed in the future )"
2013-10-28T16:30:03 <jhernandez> this is, go to the android menu, and start the GPII activity manually before running the "./android-gpii.sh start"
2013-10-28T16:47:26 <colinclark> ok, this is interesting
2013-10-28T16:47:28 <colinclark> let me try that
2013-10-28T16:52:43 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-28T16:55:26 <jhernandez> colinclark: heh, I\'m always saying interesting things :P :P
2013-10-28T17:04:56 * clown_mtg has quit
2013-10-28T17:05:09 <colinclark> If I remember, I had to do a couple of other things, jhernandez
2013-10-28T17:05:15 <colinclark> Something to do with jtar
2013-10-28T17:05:35 <colinclark> and also changing an auto generated file to link against version 18 of the Android SDK
2013-10-28T17:08:37 <jhernandez> oh, maybe was linking against 17?
2013-10-28T17:13:12 <colinclark> yep, it was
2013-10-28T17:13:55 <colinclark> jhernandez: This time, I\'m getting actual error messages from Node.js!
2013-10-28T17:14:01 <colinclark> That\'s an improvement!
2013-10-28T17:14:01 <colinclark> http://pastie.org/8437754
2013-10-28T17:15:21 <jhernandez> mmmmm
2013-10-28T17:15:25 <jhernandez> sweeet!
2013-10-28T17:15:40 <jhernandez> maybe a silly question, but ...
2013-10-28T17:15:50 <colinclark> probably not a silly question :)
2013-10-28T17:15:56 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-28T17:16:08 <jhernandez> it\'s about the js code of universal
2013-10-28T17:16:17 <jhernandez> which version are you using?
2013-10-28T17:16:28 <colinclark> let\'s check
2013-10-28T17:16:40 <colinclark> It should be whatever version the script checked out for me
2013-10-28T17:16:45 <jhernandez> and of course, which version (branch) of GPII/android are you using?
2013-10-28T17:16:45 <colinclark> last Tuesday
2013-10-28T17:16:49 <colinclark> let\'s check
2013-10-28T17:16:59 <colinclark> Android master
2013-10-28T17:17:28 <colinclark> Universal master
2013-10-28T17:17:55 <colinclark> both seem to have the latest changes in them
2013-10-28T17:18:27 <jhernandez> ok ok
2013-10-28T17:18:54 <jhernandez> seems to me that the problem should be related to the latest changes on universal
2013-10-28T17:19:17 <jhernandez> and it\'s not something related to our code from GPII/android
2013-10-28T17:19:55 <jhernandez> basically, because we can see that Anode tries to run our GPII framework
2013-10-28T17:21:01 <jhernandez> "Error invoking global function: gpii.server could not be located { type: \'initComponent\',"
2013-10-28T17:21:25 <jhernandez> this is an error from our GPII core framework
2013-10-28T17:21:30 <jhernandez> not from Android
2013-10-28T17:21:36 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-28T17:22:41 <jhernandez> later I\'ll try to build all the stuff from master, and will check if all is going fine
2013-10-28T17:23:08 <colinclark> thankks
2013-10-28T17:23:11 <jhernandez> btw, I\'ve never seen this error message before
2013-10-28T17:23:20 <colinclark> Maybe yzen has some thoughts on it?
2013-10-28T17:23:40 <jhernandez> so, let\'s pray for not to be an Android 18-related issue :S
2013-10-28T17:23:43 <jhernandez> maybe
2013-10-28T17:24:51 <jhernandez> var yzen = fluid.require("yzen");
2013-10-28T17:24:52 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-28T17:25:01 <yzen> ha
2013-10-28T17:25:05 <yzen> what\'s up jhernandez
2013-10-28T17:25:31 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-28T17:26:17 <jhernandez> colinclark and I was wondering about if you have any opinion about that error message
2013-10-28T17:32:32 <jhernandez> anyway
2013-10-28T17:32:39 <jhernandez> yzen: colinclark I\'ll give it a try later
2013-10-28T17:33:11 <yzen> oh
2013-10-28T17:33:12 <yzen> right
2013-10-28T17:33:20 <yzen> so gpii.server does not exist any more
2013-10-28T17:33:24 <yzen> it\'s kettle onw
2013-10-28T17:33:25 <yzen> now
2013-10-28T17:35:02 <jhernandez> yzen: ofc!
2013-10-28T17:35:34 <yzen> so you need to rename it in the list, and you need to make sure it\'s also available through npm
2013-10-28T17:39:15 <jhernandez> just another thing ... find the differences between https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii.js and https://github.com/GPII/android/blob/master/gpii.js
2013-10-28T18:02:37 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2013-10-28T18:07:45 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\'ve added another JIRA to the iteration page: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5194  I\'ve tagged it blocker to make sure we think about it, but I suspect it\'s not a blocker
2013-10-28T18:08:42 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks, it would be good to clean all that up
2013-10-28T18:10:14 * yzen has quit
2013-10-28T18:12:50 * sgithens has quit
2013-10-28T18:35:31 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2013-10-28T19:02:51 <anastasiac> cindyli and Justin_o, I\'m looking at the composite panel stuff. I\'m creating my own panel templates, naturally, so I\'ve got a folder for them and I\'ve set the \'templatePrefix\' to reference my folder. But now, the path to the SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorFrame.html file is wrong, because it\'s looking in the same place as my custom templates. Overriding that one specific path is a bit onerous. I wonder if we should have separate "prefixes" for
2013-10-28T19:02:52 <anastasiac> things integrators are likely to override (like panel templates), and b) things integrators are NOT likely to override (like the iframe)
