2013-09-12T18:11:54 <Justin_o> jhung: i think that issue you wanted me to look at is fixed, probably with cindy's changes
2013-09-12T18:12:02 <Justin_o> jhung: can you confirm
2013-09-12T18:12:50 <jhung> Justin_o: yep you're right.
2013-09-12T18:13:12 <jhung> I sent a pull request for GPII-196/200
2013-09-12T18:16:05 <Justin_o> jhung: cool, i'll take a look at that and resolve GPII-206

2013-09-12T18:52:51 <system64> Hi michelled, I'm back
2013-09-12T18:54:37 <michelled> hi system64. you were asking about the Infusion demos and the files included for them
2013-09-12T18:55:06 <michelled> system64: the demos have the javascript files included individually to show the dependencies for each component
2013-09-12T18:55:20 <michelled> you should make a build of Infusion and use the concatenated file
2013-09-12T18:55:55 <system64> michelled: I did try building with ant but got some error. Couldn't find anything on Google.
2013-09-12T18:56:15 <michelled> system64: what error did you get?
2013-09-12T18:56:26 <Justin_o> jhung: commented on your pull request
2013-09-12T18:56:31 <system64> michelled: http://pastie.org/pastes/8316520/text
2013-09-12T18:58:21 <jhung> Justin_o: Thanks.
2013-09-12T18:58:26 <michelled> system64: it looks like you're missing the optional script task
2013-09-12T18:58:27 <michelled> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Custom+Infusion+Builds+With+Ant#CustomInfusionBuildsWithAnt-Settinguptheenvironment
2013-09-12T18:58:27 <system64> michelled: I tried to run this in build-scripts directory - `ant -lib lib/rhino`
2013-09-12T18:58:45 <jhung> I think i lost some work when I had to do some branch pruning. I'll fix that now Justin_o
2013-09-12T18:58:51 <michelled> 'optional' meaning it's not included with ant by default
2013-09-12T18:59:30 <Justin_o> jhung: cool thanks
2013-09-12T19:00:15 <system64> michelled: Should I run this `ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=system` ?
2013-09-12T19:00:39 <system64> to install the Script task
2013-09-12T19:01:11 <michelled> yep, that should do it
2013-09-12T19:01:19 <system64> I did run this in the same directory, but it asks for fetch.xml
2013-09-12T19:01:29 <system64> How can I create one?
2013-09-12T19:02:18 <michelled> system64: it's been a long time since I've set this up. can you look at the ant documentation and see if you can find it? http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html
2013-09-12T19:11:44 <jhung> Justin_o: updated and made a comment.
2013-09-12T19:13:03 <Justin_o> jhung: cool.. i'll take a look again.. thanks
2013-09-12T19:16:36 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. i think i'll need to get vjoanna to take a look at this when she has time to see if all the changes are as they should be
2013-09-12T19:17:09 <jhung> Sure Justin_o. I'll file Jiras for the things that didn't make it in.
2013-09-12T19:17:45 <Justin_o> jhung: perfect thanks.. can you also remove those parts from the existing jiras
2013-09-12T19:17:53 <colinclark> michelled: CAT SVGs
2013-09-12T19:18:22 <jhung> will do Justin_o
2013-09-12T19:22:28 <jhung> vjoanna:  when you get a chance ask Justin_o to show you the fixes so far. I can join via skype too.

2013-09-12T15:10:44 <cindyli> michelled and Justin_o, i issued a pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/prefsEditors/pull/44 for GPII-194, to fix a couple of hovering styling issues in discovery tool. Can one of you take a look?
2013-09-12T15:11:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: i saw that.. was just chatting with jhung about it actually.. he\'s looking at GPII-195 right now.. and the fix for that may affect your pull request.. so he\'s going to try to manage both of those for the time being
2013-09-12T15:13:03 <cindyli> that\'s great. thanks, guys
2013-09-12T15:14:18 <jhung> thanks cindyli.

2013-09-12T16:19:13 <jhung> Justin_o: sure. Can you put in a jira for that?
2013-09-12T16:20:06 <Justin_o> jhung: sire
2013-09-12T16:20:07 <Justin_o> sure

2013-09-12T16:24:54 <Justin_o> just reciprocating respect
2013-09-12T16:26:25 <jhung> In that case, I demand tithes from all my subjects Justin_o. Cookies or muffins is a good start.
2013-09-12T16:26:39 <Justin_o> jhung: haha
2013-09-12T16:27:16 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'ll try to bring some in when you are around next time
2013-09-12T16:29:58 <jhung> Justin_o: done! If they\'re good, I maybe will let you clean the stables.
2013-09-12T16:31:03 <Justin_o> jhung: oh what a reward :)
2013-09-12T16:31:17 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way.. i created the jira and assigned it to you http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-204

2013-09-12T16:54:23 <jhung> Justin_o: There is one thing you can look at.
2013-09-12T16:54:43 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. what\'s that?
2013-09-12T16:55:09 <jhung> under GPII-200 there\'s an issue where the "More Text" hover isn\'t being applied when "Try something" is hovered.
2013-09-12T16:55:17 <jhung> That should probably go into its own Jira.
2013-09-12T16:55:24 <jhung> and I was wondering if you can look at it?
2013-09-12T16:56:04 <Justin_o> jhung: sure i can take a look at that
2013-09-12T16:56:26 <Justin_o> jhung: have you written the jira for it, if not i can write one up
2013-09-12T16:57:45 <jhung> Can you do that Justin_o? I\'m in a middle of a commit. :)
