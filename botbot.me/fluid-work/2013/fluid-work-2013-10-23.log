2013-10-23T16:16:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have time for a question?
2013-10-23T16:16:24 <Bosmon> hi
2013-10-23T16:16:52 <Bosmon> I\'m surprised that Chris is still receiving mail from Alex : P
2013-10-23T16:17:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess they are working together a bit behind the scenes :)
2013-10-23T16:17:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for my tests of the composite panel, they are all working in Firefox, but they are dead on IE 8 ;(
2013-10-23T16:17:58 <Bosmon> That may not be entirely helpful : P
2013-10-23T16:18:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m getting this error and a few other similar ones LOG: Wed Oct 23 11:14:30 EDT 2013:  ASSERTION FAILED: Event specification for event with name onBeginSequence does not include a base event specification: [object Object]
2013-10-23T16:19:22 <Justin_o> and LOG: Wed Oct 23 11:14:30 EDT 2013:  ASSERTION FAILED: Event specification for event with name initSubPanels does not include a base event specification: [object Object]
2013-10-23T16:20:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - doesn\'t cindy have a JIRA open about a test failure about such an issue?
2013-10-23T16:20:53 <Justin_o> the subPanels use initSubPanels as a createOnEvent...  initSubPanels is triggered by the parent\'s afterRender
2013-10-23T16:21:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh does she? so this is a known issue with the framework?
2013-10-23T16:23:21 * vjoanna has quit
2013-10-23T16:23:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the demo doesn\'t work either for the same reason, so this means that the prefsFramework won\'t be usable in IE8
2013-10-23T16:25:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. yes.. i\'ve found the jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5174
2013-10-23T16:25:56 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2013-10-23T16:26:02 <Bosmon> I will look at it after this GPII meeting
2013-10-23T16:26:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m going to make that a blocker for 1.5
2013-10-23T16:26:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2013-10-23T16:26:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, the community meeting today will be about the infusion 1.5 release
