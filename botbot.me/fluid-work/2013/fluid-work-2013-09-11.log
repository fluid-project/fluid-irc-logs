2013-09-11T17:23:40 <colinclark> though to a significantly lesser extent
2013-09-11T17:23:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: quick question.. is there a way to update the view of a renderer component whose model is changed programmatically without calling refreshView. For example, if i render out a checkbox.
2013-09-11T17:25:06 <colinclark> I guess your point is that a "Device specification" includes both information about OS, etc. as well as a list of relevant application IDs, yzen?
2013-09-11T17:25:16 <yzen> colinclark: yes

2013-09-11T17:26:59 <colinclark> I imagine we\'ll have to use a query parameter
2013-09-11T17:27:09 <colinclark> and compact our JSON payload
2013-09-11T17:27:54 <yzen> colinclark: yes i was thinking about that too

2013-09-11T17:30:15 * [o__o] joined the channel
2013-09-11T17:33:32 <yzen> colinclark: ya I\'m pretty comfortable with that , just was not sure if everyone\'s comfortable with sticking everything into the url
2013-09-11T17:34:27 <colinclark> Yes, I\'m okay with it :)
2013-09-11T17:35:06 <yzen> colinclark: any suggestions on the actual url path ? e.g. user/{token}/? I think we ll remove user part in the separate JIRA, if that\'s ok
2013-09-11T17:35:22 <yzen> Bosmon: ^
2013-09-11T17:35:23 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s ok
2013-09-11T17:35:37 <colinclark> So we still have to clarify what comes out the other end
2013-09-11T17:36:15 <colinclark> If I\'m Facebook, do I want a big lifecycle specification?
2013-09-11T17:36:50 <colinclark> I imagine I just want a JSON object containing some setting names and some values
2013-09-11T17:38:15 <yzen> colinclark: well it depends on many things afaik , what is stored in the solutions registry, output of the matchmaker etc
2013-09-11T17:38:46 <colinclark> how so?
2013-09-11T17:40:28 <yzen> colinclark: would you expect Facebook entry to be in the solutions registry ?
2013-09-11T17:41:50 <yzen> or rather
2013-09-11T17:42:23 <yzen> would you expect (when faceboook requests something ) the flow manger to communicate to matchmaker?
2013-09-11T17:47:41 * anvk has quit
2013-09-11T17:48:58 <colinclark> I do think Facebook would be an entry in the Solutions Registry, yes
2013-09-11T17:50:06 <colinclark> and I think it\'s quite possible that when Facebook requests something, the Flow Manager will need to delegate to a matchmaker, yes
2013-09-11T17:50:16 <colinclark> it largely depends on what a Matchmaker actually bothers to do
2013-09-11T17:50:34 <colinclark> I suspect that no current Matchmaker could meaningfully contribute anything to Facebook\'s workflow
2013-09-11T17:50:39 <colinclark> but can you think of some examples of it?
2013-09-11T17:51:11 <yzen> colinclark: the question is, whether there\'s another step (different from a request to lifecycle manager) or it returns the matchmaker output to the client (Facebook)
2013-09-11T17:51:32 <colinclark> Remind me again what the nature of the Matchmaker\'s output is?
2013-09-11T17:51:42 <colinclark> Do we have an example posted somewhere?
2013-09-11T17:51:50 <yzen> colinclark: Facebook can probably make use of some of the common prefs
2013-09-11T17:51:59 <yzen> i think so one sec
2013-09-11T17:52:56 <yzen> http://pastie.org/8317600
2013-09-11T17:53:33 <yzen> colinclark: i can see how this is not very helpful
2013-09-11T17:53:37 <colinclark> no
2013-09-11T17:53:41 <colinclark> not at all, for facebook
2013-09-11T17:57:24 <yzen> colinclark: so we have these sections in there : lifecycleManager, settingsHandlers, settingsHandlers.settings

2013-09-11T18:00:07 <colinclark> For Facebook, I suspect all we will ever want to share is the settingsHnadlers.settings part
2013-09-11T18:00:12 <colinclark> It may well be that the Matchmaker will have some say over what goes into that

2013-09-11T13:45:13 <jhung> Justin_o, michelled: I was wondering if we can remove the Completed tasks from the Discovery Tool iteration plan wiki page?
2013-09-11T13:46:24 <Justin_o> jhung: we are keeping around the the completed tasks that haven\'t yet been merged into the gpii repo
2013-09-11T13:46:33 <Justin_o> that way we can keep track of what\'s missing from there
2013-09-11T13:46:40 <jhung> Justin_o: ok sounds good.
2013-09-11T13:47:10 <Justin_o> jhung: although some of these may have not been updated as we have recently sent a pull request to them.. i\'ll try to clean it up today
2013-09-11T13:47:26 <jhung> Justin_o: I assume the latest jiras have not been added to the page yet? I don\'t see them...
2013-09-11T13:48:40 <Justin_o> amilchev: looked into your issue a bit more yesterday and talked with cindyli and Bosmon about it.. for now i think you\'ll have to go with a single template that is combined ahead of time. cindyli and I will look into tackling the issue of complex panels. we\'ll start this by attempting to create a grade that can merge templates together ahead of rendering.
2013-09-11T13:49:12 <Justin_o> jhung: no not yet.. i think we were waiting on michelled to check in with jessm about some things
2013-09-11T13:49:36 <jhung> ok got it.
2013-09-11T13:52:15 <michelled> jhung: you can add those new JIRAs to the page - the ones we said we would try to complete
2013-09-11T13:52:32 <jhung> michelled: sure.
2013-09-11T13:52:35 <michelled> we might shift to a quick sprint on Dani\'s tool - I\'ll try to figure that out today

2013-09-11T16:43:44 <colinclark> yzen, Bosmon: So do we agree that we\'ve got two somewhat different activities that Flow Manager can accomplish? 1. Stateful, device-specific configuration and 2. Stateless transformation of user preferences to settings for a particular "application" (i.e. web app or other remote service)
2013-09-11T16:43:56 <colinclark> #2, in effect, is a subset of what is done as part of #1, I think
2013-09-11T16:44:30 <Bosmon> That seems correct
2013-09-11T16:44:35 <yzen> yes
2013-09-11T16:44:43 <Bosmon> I wonder how the two activities are related in time and scope
2013-09-11T16:45:26 <colinclark> I\'d like to imagine that #2 is called repeatedly as part of the work of #1, and its results are then operated on directly.
2013-09-11T16:45:47 <colinclark> I mean, I\'m genuinely hopeful that #1 is a true subset
2013-09-11T16:46:10 <colinclark> but I suspect some refactoring will have to happen
2013-09-11T16:49:00 <colinclark> So my first proposal for the REST API for #2 is this: GET http://flow.gpii.net/token/<xyz>/settings/<app-id>
2013-09-11T16:49:11 <colinclark> or one might argue for the ability to specify a set of application IDs
2013-09-11T16:55:03 <yzen> colinclark: i was thinking that if settings/<app-id> is not present the whole set is returned
2013-09-11T16:55:30 <colinclark> the preference set is returned, unmodified?
2013-09-11T16:56:49 <yzen> colinclark: well not the preference set but the matched solutions and settings based on the user token id
2013-09-11T16:57:13 <colinclark> what solutions would be matched in the case of a cloud-based flow manager? Can you elaborate?
2013-09-11T16:57:15 <yzen> colinclark: sort of what i described on the wiki
2013-09-11T16:57:31 <yzen> colinclark: so currently you can POST with device data
2013-09-11T16:57:36 <colinclark> ah
2013-09-11T16:57:38 <colinclark> curious
2013-09-11T16:58:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you have time, can you look at this jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5131
2013-09-11T16:58:11 <colinclark> I suppose this is a legitimate third activity
2013-09-11T16:58:26 <colinclark> we should talk this through, it\'s fascinating
2013-09-11T16:58:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s for the work that we talked about in the channel yesterday.. does it sound right?
2013-09-11T16:59:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it sounds right in outline, but needs to be fleshed out with a detailed implementation strategy
2013-09-11T17:01:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. do you have time for some questions about that detail implementation strategy
2013-09-11T17:01:31 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-11T17:01:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - in a bit... still on a GPII call
2013-09-11T17:01:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. please let cindyli and I know when you are free
2013-09-11T17:04:07 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-09-11T17:08:01 <yzen> so colinclark, Bosmon we have this API at the moment:
2013-09-11T17:08:02 <yzen> {flow manager}/user/{token}/login
2013-09-11T17:08:04 <yzen> {flow manager}/user/{token}/logout
2013-09-11T17:08:26 <colinclark> yup
2013-09-11T17:08:36 <yzen> the one that was added already is:
2013-09-11T17:08:46 <colinclark> which is only meaningful for a local, stageful Flow Manager
2013-09-11T17:08:53 <yzen> yes
2013-09-11T17:09:05 <yzen> POST {flow manager}/user/{token}/login with the payload that is is exactly like the device reporter one
2013-09-11T17:09:21 <colinclark> Two issues with this one
2013-09-11T17:09:35 <colinclark> I\'m not sure the semantics of this action are indeed suitable for a POST
2013-09-11T17:09:44 <colinclark> since presumably we don\'t actually change any server-side state
2013-09-11T17:10:07 <colinclark> and thus, relatedly, it\'s probably not a "login" action
2013-09-11T17:10:08 <colinclark> otherwise, I think this is reasonable
2013-09-11T17:10:15 <colinclark> let\'s just think about what it actually is
2013-09-11T17:10:18 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-09-11T17:10:20 <yzen> yes
2013-09-11T17:10:21 <Bosmon> What actually is it?
2013-09-11T17:10:25 <Bosmon> And why isn\'t it the other way round?
2013-09-11T17:10:43 <yzen> Bosmon: what is ?
2013-09-11T17:10:45 <colinclark> Other way around how?
2013-09-11T17:11:01 <Bosmon> Why is it not a GET which returns the payload, rather than a POST which accepts it?
2013-09-11T17:11:32 <colinclark> I need to clarify...
2013-09-11T17:11:42 <colinclark> A "GET which returns" which payload, specifically?
2013-09-11T17:11:53 <Bosmon> The same one that is currently accepted by the POST
2013-09-11T17:12:08 <Bosmon> And, being the way it is, WHEN exactly during the lifecycle do we expect it to be called?
2013-09-11T17:12:11 <Bosmon> And what happens if it isn\'t
2013-09-11T17:12:49 <colinclark> I\'m slightly confused now
2013-09-11T17:12:57 <Bosmon> That\'s good :)
2013-09-11T17:13:01 <colinclark> So if we have three different actions on the Flow Manager
2013-09-11T17:13:03 <Bosmon> This is "confusion of the kind we want" : P
2013-09-11T17:13:08 <colinclark> yes :)
2013-09-11T17:13:28 <colinclark> 1. Something stateful that does something to configure a particular device on which the Flow Manager is installed
2013-09-11T17:13:38 <colinclark> This one is actually the weirdest case, but it might not look weird because it\'s all we\'ve got
2013-09-11T17:14:27 <colinclark> 2. Something stateless that, given a user token and a JSON payload describing a "remote device," returns (I think) a full "Lifecycle Specification"
2013-09-11T17:14:46 <colinclark> 3. Something stateless that, given a user token and a particular application ID, produces a transformed, filtered set of settings for that application
2013-09-11T17:14:55 <colinclark> I believe that #3 is what a web app needs
2013-09-11T17:15:12 <colinclark> I think #2 is probably just there for consistency, but perhaps you can describe more, yzen
2013-09-11T17:15:36 <yzen> colinclark: for some reason i feel like 3 is a subset of 2
2013-09-11T17:15:42 * mrvisser has quit
2013-09-11T17:15:46 <colinclark> Indeed
2013-09-11T17:16:04 <colinclark> As far as I can tell, #3 is a subset of #2, which is a subset of #1

2013-09-11T17:16:19 <Bosmon> What do you mean by "is a subset of"
2013-09-11T17:16:25 <colinclark> Well, I guess that\'s not entirely true
2013-09-11T17:16:32 <Bosmon> And can you explain how something stateful can be a subset of something stateless : P
2013-09-11T17:16:40 <colinclark> I\'m not

2013-09-11T17:17:30 <colinclark> The stateful action is composed of several of the stateless actions, plus some other stateful ones
2013-09-11T17:17:48 <yzen> well
2013-09-11T17:17:55 <yzen> lifecycle manager now a separate server
2013-09-11T17:18:00 <colinclark> I believe in this case "subset of" means "This action is done as part of a larger collection of actions"
2013-09-11T17:18:05 <yzen> so flow manager is not stateful at all
2013-09-11T17:18:12 <colinclark> that\'s nice :)
2013-09-11T17:18:17 <colinclark> that\'s a very good start
2013-09-11T17:19:02 <colinclark> So, what does #2 do with the device information, yzen?
2013-09-11T17:19:46 <yzen> colinclark: well that relates to the earlier issue i was talking to you about: the cloud based flow manager has no access to the device reporter to combine its output with the user preference set to send it to match maker
2013-09-11T17:19:57 <yzen> in order to match anything we need that device payload
2013-09-11T17:20:09 <colinclark> Sure, that makes sense
2013-09-11T17:20:33 <colinclark> my first point here is that this is, for most clients of the cloud-based flow manager, irrelevant
2013-09-11T17:20:56 <colinclark> So, we really do need to split this up into "what functionality will each of these \'services\' provide?"
2013-09-11T17:21:22 <colinclark> In the first case, we\'re talking about the kind of functionality we\'re familiar with--setting up an actual device that is "right here" on the local device where the flow manager is installed
2013-09-11T17:21:28 <colinclark> #2 is like a variation on that
