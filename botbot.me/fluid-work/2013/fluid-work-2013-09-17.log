2013-09-17T23:35:20 <kasparnet> evening dr. bosmon Bosmon8
2013-09-17T23:35:42 <Bosmon> Damn, &c, &c
2013-09-17T23:35:50 <kasparnet> :D
2013-09-17T23:36:24 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I'm working on the model transformation documentation and got a question
2013-09-17T23:36:52 <Bosmon> Hi
2013-09-17T23:37:26 <kasparnet> is there a reason that fluid.transforms.firstValue is not a standardTransformationFunction?
2013-09-17T23:37:37 <Bosmon> I believe there is, yes
2013-09-17T23:38:27 <Bosmon> It accepts multiple values
2013-09-17T23:39:05 <kasparnet> doesn't it just accept one value, but one that has to be an array?
2013-09-17T23:39:10 <Bosmon> Well
2013-09-17T23:39:19 <Bosmon> I guess we didn't have this theory worked out at the tie
2013-09-17T23:39:20 <Bosmon> time
2013-09-17T23:39:31 <Bosmon> Array-valued transformers didn't exist
2013-09-17T23:39:43 <Bosmon> Feel free to rationalise it if you can make it work
2013-09-17T23:40:22 <kasparnet> ok - wont do that now, but I'll create a JIRA for it and assign to me to fix later
2013-09-17T23:40:39 <Bosmon> Cool
2013-09-17T23:40:42 <Bosmon> How has the day gone?
2013-09-17T23:40:45 <Bosmon> Any HACCKING?
2013-09-17T23:40:55 <kasparnet> the day has been really good
2013-09-17T23:41:04 <kasparnet> all the presentations went well, etc
2013-09-17T23:41:19 <kasparnet> and we had people over for bbq this evening which was really nice
2013-09-17T23:41:33 <kasparnet> ... now we're drunk and doing the last bit of prepping for tomorrow
2013-09-17T23:41:49 <Bosmon> cool
2013-09-17T23:42:30 <kasparnet> (actually, I'm just staying awake to make sure yzen doesn't misbehave on a classic drunken russian rampage)
2013-09-17T23:43:33 <Bosmon> Get him to teach you that excellent card game, **DURRAKK**

2013-09-17T15:04:07 <colinclark> Justin_o, michelled: Since you both asked me about it, I have responded on list regarding the FSS
2013-09-17T15:04:27 <colinclark> I remain still somewhat concerned about the prospect of deprecating something we have no clear ideas about
2013-09-17T15:04:45 <colinclark> but I guess the lack of ideas shouldn\'t prevent of us from at least seeing the writing on the wall for FSS
2013-09-17T15:08:44 <michelled> thanks for sending that colinclark
2013-09-17T15:09:14 <colinclark> michelled: So you\'ve reviewed the "three on a match" pull request that appears to be included with this one? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/399
2013-09-17T15:09:33 <michelled> colinclark: yes, it\'s already in the repository

2013-09-17T15:51:34 <Justin_o> when we try to post it returns a 404
2013-09-17T15:51:43 <Justin_o> any ideas
2013-09-17T15:51:44 <Justin_o> ?
2013-09-17T15:53:51 * jhung joined the channel
2013-09-17T15:56:32 <colinclark> I suspect it is incapable of accepting POSTs in development mode
2013-09-17T15:56:38 <colinclark> It\'s backed by a static JSON file
2013-09-17T15:57:18 <colinclark> You know you really have been missing working with CouchDB over the past several years anyway, Justin_o
2013-09-17T15:57:19 <colinclark> ;)
2013-09-17T15:57:39 <colinclark> Your laptop has a void in it,
2013-09-17T15:57:42 <colinclark> a lonely gap
2013-09-17T15:57:48 <colinclark> which you can fill by installing CouchDB
2013-09-17T15:57:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: :)
2013-09-17T15:58:41 <avtar> Justin_o: couchdb 1.3.1 is installed
2013-09-17T15:59:58 <Justin_o> avtar: oh really.. so i just need to switch to production environment?

2013-09-17T16:02:26 <colinclark> Justin_o: It should be documented in the GPII wiki
2013-09-17T16:02:36 <colinclark> there\'s an environment variable you need to set, if I remember correctly

2013-09-17T16:07:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks.. i\'ll look into it again after the scripts are all setup
2013-09-17T16:09:04 <avtar> kasparnet: does the wiki cover steps required to prime a couchdb database if someone wants to switch to production from development?

2013-09-17T20:16:23 <michelled> colinclark, Bosmon: it looks like something that got merged in today has broken the styling of the themes in the Fat Panel UIO in the grades demo. I haven\'t looked into it yet - does it ring a bell?
2013-09-17T20:16:39 <michelled> instead of seeing the \'a\' with the theme colours, I see the theme name
2013-09-17T20:16:51 <colinclark> nope
2013-09-17T20:17:11 <colinclark> I can\'t say that I tested the UIO demos particularly rigorously, though
2013-09-17T20:17:40 <michelled> same issue with the schema demo
2013-09-17T20:18:09 <michelled> colinclark: are you seeing the correct styling?
2013-09-17T20:19:56 <Bosmon> Hi michelled - I had assumed that the style breakage was just my usual failure to run the builder correctly to generate the CSS files
2013-09-17T20:20:21 <Bosmon> If there is a real breakage, my first guess it is caused by failing to catch one of the cases where an invoker now needs to be marked as "dynamic" in the UIO hierarchy
2013-09-17T20:21:24 <michelled> Bosmon: it very well could be the builder. I somehow constantly forget to run that :(
2013-09-17T20:21:26 <michelled> let me try again
2013-09-17T20:23:09 * clown_mtg has quit
2013-09-17T20:25:53 <michelled> Bosmon: nope, even with the rebuilt CSS files the styling issue remains
2013-09-17T20:26:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - do you happen to remember where you put your sketch for the "visibility model" implementation?
2013-09-17T20:27:11 <Bosmon> The thing which maps a set of flags in the model to the visibility of a set of DOM binder selectors?
2013-09-17T20:28:03 <cindyli> trying to rmb. did i ever do that \xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2013-09-17T20:30:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - you did
2013-09-17T20:30:43 <colinclark> was it part of the model relay work in the Video Player?
2013-09-17T20:30:55 <cindyli> sorry, don\'t recall, Bosmon. more context?
2013-09-17T20:31:39 <cindyli> no, the model relay work in vp was from Bosmon
2013-09-17T20:31:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - not model relay
2013-09-17T20:31:53 <colinclark> I think it had to do with binding  a chunk of model to the DOM in terms of whether an element should be visible or invisible, enabled or disabled
2013-09-17T20:31:54 <colinclark> something likethat?
2013-09-17T20:31:54 <Bosmon> But "visibility model"
2013-09-17T20:32:16 <cindyli> i did the model relay for uio
2013-09-17T20:33:08 <Bosmon> cindyli - not model relay!
2013-09-17T20:33:35 <cindyli> what\'s the "visibility model" for
2013-09-17T20:34:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - described in http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4928
2013-09-17T20:34:19 <Bosmon> You had made a sketch implementation of this, but I can\'t remember what component it was for
2013-09-17T20:34:28 <Bosmon> Is it possible it is just sitting in a branch somewhere and never reached master?
2013-09-17T20:35:44 * kasparnet joined the channel
2013-09-17T20:35:51 <Bosmon> The pasted fragment of impl I have there suggests this MUST have been part of a video player impl
2013-09-17T20:38:21 <cindyli> ah, yes, i wrote this "fluid.videoPlayer.showHide"
2013-09-17T20:38:41 <cindyli> that\'s about it: https://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer/blob/master/js/VideoPlayer_showHide.js
2013-09-17T20:41:11 <Bosmon> Thanks cindyli - that\'s it!
2013-09-17T20:41:58 <cindyli> thanks to your neatly composed jira, Bosmon, the component was mentioned in there :)
2013-09-17T20:42:33 <Bosmon> Yes, in the end I found I had such an ancient version of the videoPlayer checked out that I couldn\'t find that code ....

2013-09-17T00:26:44 <avtar> just to confirm, i should be select the 1.2 branch for everything?
2013-09-17T00:27:24 <yzen> avtar: 0.2
2013-09-17T00:27:29 <yzen> so lets reca
2013-09-17T00:27:31 <yzen> recap
2013-09-17T00:27:49 <yzen> you only care about the universal repository
2013-09-17T00:27:50 <avtar> 0.2 is what i meant
2013-09-17T00:27:53 <avtar> really
2013-09-17T00:27:57 <avtar> yes
2013-09-17T00:28:01 <avtar> i love it
2013-09-17T00:28:16 <yzen> so yes you need a v0.2 branch of universal
2013-09-17T00:28:23 <yzen> now regarding the things we are deploying
2013-09-17T00:28:30 <yzen> i realized we actually only need 2 thinkgs
2013-09-17T00:28:33 <yzen> things
2013-09-17T00:28:38 <yzen> the flow manager and the match maker
2013-09-17T00:28:46 <yzen> we can forget about the ontology for the time being
2013-09-17T00:28:58 <avtar> ok
2013-09-17T00:29:01 <yzen> so once you clone v0.2
2013-09-17T00:29:05 <yzen> you need to run nom install
2013-09-17T00:29:08 <yzen> to get the right stuff
2013-09-17T00:29:18 <avtar> yup
2013-09-17T00:29:32 <avtar> and just use kettle instead of what's in the old docs?
2013-09-17T00:29:38 <yzen> so yes
2013-09-17T00:29:46 <yzen> 2 servers you are deploying are:
2013-09-17T00:29:52 <yzen> FLOW MANAGER:
2013-09-17T00:29:56 <avtar> SWEET
2013-09-17T00:30:18 <yzen> NODE_ENV=cloudBased node node_modules/kettle/lib/init.js gpii/node_modules/flowManager/config
2013-09-17T00:30:29 <avtar> oh
2013-09-17T00:30:30 <avtar> wait
2013-09-17T00:31:26 <yzen> and the
2013-09-17T00:31:31 <yzen> MATCH MAKER:
2013-09-17T00:31:35 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/v0.2/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/cloudBased.json#L16

2013-09-17T00:31:50 <avtar> just point that to MATCH MAKER instead of LOCALHOST
2013-09-17T00:31:51 <avtar> ?
2013-09-17T00:32:01 <yzen> yes
2013-09-17T00:32:03 <avtar> ok
2013-09-17T00:32:05 <yzen> so that s the thing
2013-09-17T00:32:14 <yzen> we need to point to the real url
2013-09-17T00:32:16 <yzen> is that ok ?
2013-09-17T00:33:05 <avtar> and https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/v0.2/gpii/node_modules/matchMaker/configs/production.json for MATCH MAKER?
2013-09-17T00:33:25 <yzen> no
2013-09-17T00:33:36 <yzen> so since we don't specify NODE_EV
2013-09-17T00:33:38 <yzen> ENV
2013-09-17T00:33:44 <yzen> it will be development by default
2013-09-17T00:33:47 <yzen> which is what we want
2013-09-17T00:34:20 <avtar> ok
2013-09-17T00:34:31 <avtar> i won't fail you guys
2013-09-17T00:34:35 <yzen> production would require a real ontology
2013-09-17T00:34:43 <yzen> well it looks like I'm here for a couple of hours
2013-09-17T00:34:49 <avtar> seriously?
2013-09-17T00:34:49 <yzen> so i can try it :)
2013-09-17T00:34:51 <avtar> ok
2013-09-17T00:34:56 <yzen> like BOSSSSS
2013-09-17T00:35:00 <yzen> like a
2013-09-17T00:35:04 <avtar> a sleep deprived one
2013-09-17T00:35:32 <yzen> in mother russia you deprive sleep
2013-09-17T00:35:57 <avtar> or it deprives you

2013-09-17T01:34:48 <sgithens> jhernandez yzen : Thanks!
2013-09-17T01:34:58 <yzen> sgithens: BAM
2013-09-17T01:38:03 <jhernandez> sgithens: thanks to you!!
2013-09-17T01:38:07 <jhernandez> ;)
2013-09-17T01:38:45 <sgithens> jhernandez: I'm sure that source dir change is fine, I just haven't gotten a chance to do a full build from scratch on it yet.
2013-09-17T01:40:00 <jhernandez> sgithens: well, is fine, but it sometimes doesn't works the first time and I'm not sure why
2013-09-17T01:40:32 <jhernandez> sometimes you need to run source ./prebuild.sh again and then the build ends successfully
2013-09-17T01:40:56 <sgithens> hmm
2013-09-17T01:41:27 <sgithens> Mother Bellarussia would never go for that.
2013-09-17T01:41:46 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-09-17T01:44:48 <jhernandez> sgithens: btw, I wrote the installation instructions: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Core_(real-time)_Framework_v0.2_-_Installation_Instructions#Android_Installation_Instructions
2013-09-17T01:45:35 <jhernandez> it's pretty similar than the instructions it's already in README.md
2013-09-17T01:46:52 <sgithens> awesome!
2013-09-17T01:47:09 <sgithens> I sort of wish we had a way of including some of our github readme's in the wiki
2013-09-17T01:47:26 <sgithens> it's something I complain about, about once a year, and then forget about
2013-09-17T01:47:42 <kasparnet> ping avtar
2013-09-17T01:48:09 <kasparnet> sgithens: hey dude!!
2013-09-17T01:48:11 <jhernandez> sgithens: sure, it would be nice to have it
2013-09-17T01:48:23 <kasparnet> sgithens: we miss you down here
2013-09-17T01:48:25 <sgithens> KASPARNET!
2013-09-17T01:48:27 <avtar> kasparnet: hi hi
2013-09-17T01:48:29 <sgithens> I miss you guys
2013-09-17T01:48:37 <sgithens> I am *really* tired of working on this thing
2013-09-17T01:48:48 <sgithens> I can't wait till it's done
2013-09-17T01:49:08 <sgithens> why is putting something into production the first time ever so damn hard
2013-09-17T01:50:03 <kasparnet> sgithens: yeah, I know... even cutting the fucking v0.2 has been horrific, and that's so far from something production worthy
2013-09-17T01:50:12 <jhernandez> sgithens: evil reviewers maybe?
2013-09-17T01:50:14 <jhernandez> :P
2013-09-17T01:50:28 <sgithens> haha
2013-09-17T01:50:42 <kasparnet> jhernandez: *cough* BOSMON *cough*
2013-09-17T01:50:43 <sgithens> the server side flow manager github notifications have been pretty epic
2013-09-17T01:50:59 <Bosmon> kasparnet !!!!!!
