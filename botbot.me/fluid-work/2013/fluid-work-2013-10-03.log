b'2013-10-03T18:01:57 <Bosmon> The quality of our detection could be better
2013-10-03T18:02:08 <Bosmon> As jQuery\'s equivalent of this method shows, the issue is quite complex
2013-10-03T18:02:27 <Bosmon> Since in between the "exotic" objects and the "plain" objects, there is the category of "objects with prototype or constructor"
2013-10-03T18:02:37 <Bosmon> Which for various reasons on IE are extremely expensive to detect
2013-10-03T18:02:56 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-10-03T18:03:31 <Bosmon> Right now we make the facile but not completely accurate determination that a "non-exotic object" is a "plain object"
2013-10-03T18:03:40 <Bosmon> Is that any clearer?
2013-10-03T18:05:58 <Bosmon> colinclark ^
2013-10-03T18:06:11 <colinclark> sorry, one sec
2013-10-03T18:06:16 <colinclark> boss is on the phone
2013-10-03T18:35:24 <colinclark> Bosmon: Ok. So a typed array is not a primitive object, but neither is it a plan object.
2013-10-03T18:35:42 <colinclark> So what does that mean for the fate of said object within the merging system?
2013-10-03T18:36:38 * greggy has quit
2013-10-03T18:36:42 <Bosmon> colinclark - it is treated as if it is a primitive object, in fact
2013-10-03T18:37:03 <Bosmon> At least, all of the current tests sites separately combine the predicates "isPrimitive" and "!isPlainObject"
2013-10-03T18:37:14 <Bosmon> But the tests are broken out in case they end up being separately useful at some point

2013-10-03T21:13:43 <colinclark> oh Bosmon
2013-10-03T21:13:44 <Bosmon> Did I manage to resolve your queries on isPlainObject?
2013-10-03T21:13:44 <colinclark> hello
2013-10-03T21:14:01 <colinclark> Yes, you certainly did
2013-10-03T21:14:19 <Bosmon> cool
2013-10-03T21:14:36 <colinclark> thank you
2013-10-03T21:14:43 <colinclark> I\'ll push the code this evening

2013-10-03T17:20:24 <yzen> colinclark: hi
2013-10-03T17:20:33 <colinclark> you were mentioning liking debugging Node.js apps with eclipse
2013-10-03T17:20:47 <yzen> colinclark: yes and it\'s pretty nice
2013-10-03T17:20:55 <colinclark> Does it show any more than the 10 stack frames that node-inspector does?
2013-10-03T17:21:00 <yzen> no :(
2013-10-03T17:21:10 <yzen> it\'s not really node-inspector\'s setting
2013-10-03T17:21:14 <colinclark> yeah
2013-10-03T17:21:16 <colinclark> I know
2013-10-03T17:22:32 <yzen> here\'s the page i used to set everything uphttps://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Using-Eclipse-as-Node-Applications-Debugger
2013-10-03T17:22:52 <yzen> you can also debug external node apps as well
2013-10-03T17:22:55 <jhernandez> ** cough ** .. eclipse? really?
2013-10-03T17:23:09 <yzen> jhernandez: isn\'t it awesome
2013-10-03T17:23:10 <yzen> :)
2013-10-03T17:23:15 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-10-03T17:23:28 <jhernandez> not for me but for others sure!
2013-10-03T17:23:33 <jhernandez> :P
2013-10-03T17:23:40 <yzen> no kasparnet can not complaint that chrome crashes every time he\'s debugging
2013-10-03T17:23:45 <yzen> he has no excuse any more
2013-10-03T17:23:49 <jhernandez> haha
2013-10-03T17:24:33 <yzen> Bosmon: you sitll use eclipse ?
2013-10-03T17:24:45 <Bosmon> yzen - every day
2013-10-03T17:24:54 <Bosmon> colinclark has been telling me about "what is now cool" in the node.js world : P
2013-10-03T17:24:58 <yzen> Bosmon: nice so you ll find it handy
2013-10-03T17:25:12 <colinclark> jhernandez: dude I\'m with you
2013-10-03T17:25:18 <Bosmon> I did try to get that debugger working a few years ago and it was a miserable and unrewarding experience
2013-10-03T17:25:21 <Bosmon> But it sounds like it is now working?
2013-10-03T17:25:27 <colinclark> all I want is a text editor
2013-10-03T17:25:44 <yzen> Bosmon: yes it works well
2013-10-03T17:25:55 <jhernandez> oh my god! Bosmon uses eclipse? (I just dropped a myth!) :P
2013-10-03T17:25:56 <Bosmon> colinclark - still the ability to "scope a search within a project" is the one remanent feature from Eclipse I find useful for non-Java programming
2013-10-03T17:26:07 <jhernandez> colinclark: +1
2013-10-03T17:26:11 <Bosmon> It\'s not clear how I would do that with a simple text editor : P
2013-10-03T17:26:23 <colinclark> I am a pretty inept programmer
2013-10-03T17:26:30 <colinclark> so I prefer my tools to reflect that
2013-10-03T17:26:30 <Bosmon> But my main question is, does the node Eclipse debugger still suffer from the 10 stack-frame limit that we have in node-inspector?
2013-10-03T17:26:33 <yzen> Bosmon: you can with sublime
2013-10-03T17:26:44 <yzen> Bosmon: of course :)
2013-10-03T17:26:59 <yzen> who needs more than 10?
2013-10-03T17:27:11 <jhernandez> yzen: that\'s true!
2013-10-03T17:27:12 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-10-03T17:27:34 <Bosmon> yzen - anyone who debugs into the framework, I guess
2013-10-03T17:27:42 <Bosmon> I imagine you don\'t find yourself doing that very much :)
2013-10-03T17:27:50 <colinclark> It\'s like the Node.js version of jessm\'s adage, "there are always three things"
2013-10-03T17:27:54 <yzen> :) i guess where the problem is
2013-10-03T17:28:00 <colinclark> except it\'s "there are always 10 stack frames"
2013-10-03T17:28:52 <colinclark> yzen: To that I say, "show me your pull request" ;)
2013-10-03T17:30:29 <colinclark> jhernandez: PUPPY REPORT?
2013-10-03T17:30:42 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-03T17:30:53 <jhernandez> they\'re fine

2013-10-03T17:41:51 <danaayotte> colinclark: thx!
2013-10-03T17:42:44 <colinclark> So we\'ve determined that Eclipse is cool again
2013-10-03T17:43:00 <colinclark> which means IBM WebSphere for Node.js must be the next big wave of awesomeness
2013-10-03T17:43:29 <colinclark> Watch out Kettle! Here comes Local, Home, and Remote interfaces for all your JSON!
2013-10-03T17:53:27 <colinclark> Bosmon: Quick question for you, if you have a second
2013-10-03T17:53:57 <Bosmon> Hi colinclark
2013-10-03T17:54:33 <colinclark> So I\'m just about to push your isPlainObject() pull request
2013-10-03T17:54:58 <colinclark> I just wanted to get clarity on what the role of isPrimitive() is in the framework now
2013-10-03T17:56:01 <colinclark> I\'ve removed my monkey patches from Flocking and all is looking good
2013-10-03T17:57:11 <Bosmon> colinclark - hi
2013-10-03T17:57:18 <colinclark> lol
2013-10-03T17:57:22 <colinclark> hi
2013-10-03T17:57:34 <Bosmon> I guess you could say "isPrimitive" is a proxy for the concept of "a kind of object that the framework shouldn\'t seek to touch"
2013-10-03T17:57:41 <Bosmon> These objects will just be ferried around by object reference
2013-10-03T17:57:53 <Bosmon> And the framework will not seek to copy them, modify their properties, or look inside them
2013-10-03T17:58:35 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-03T17:58:41 <colinclark> whereas a plain object?
2013-10-03T17:58:55 <Bosmon> A "plain" object is what you could call "JSON-equivalent"
2013-10-03T17:59:07 <Bosmon> And entirely equivalent to a decomposition in terms of its properties
2013-10-03T17:59:51 <colinclark> I don\'t think I fully understand
