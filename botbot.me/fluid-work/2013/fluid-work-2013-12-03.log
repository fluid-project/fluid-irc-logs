2013-12-03T14:31:45 <Justin_o> yzen: do we have a spec for creating a datasource?
2013-12-03T14:32:40 <yzen> Justin_o: you mean some defined api ?
2013-12-03T14:33:10 <yzen> Justin_o: best thing we had in GPII is here https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js
2013-12-03T14:33:14 <yzen> no spec really
2013-12-03T14:33:59 <Justin_o> yzen: thanks
2013-12-03T14:34:43 <Justin_o> yzen: so a datasource can take any format, or is it expected to have some specific methods and etc?
2013-12-03T14:36:10 <yzen> get set delete are the methods
2013-12-03T14:36:37 <yzen> args for those methods are pretty well set
2013-12-03T14:37:43 <Justin_o> yzen: okay.. can you send me the link where those are defined.. seems like the get method at least is in a different file
2013-12-03T14:39:08 <yzen> Justin_o: here it is but you have to read the invoker spec https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L329
2013-12-03T14:39:18 <yzen> basically it\'s directModel, model, callback
2013-12-03T14:41:16 <Justin_o> yzen: i don\'t see this method "kettle.dataSource.get" defined anywhere
2013-12-03T14:41:19 * anvk joined the channel
2013-12-03T14:41:50 <yzen> yes those are replaced by the actual data source implementations see URL or couchDB datasource defaults

2013-12-03T16:34:28 <colinclark> Justin_o: Did you see the brief conversation last night about CasperJS?
2013-12-03T16:34:34 <colinclark> not to be confused with kasparnet, of course
2013-12-03T16:34:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: :) no i didn\'t see that..
2013-12-03T16:35:06 <colinclark> Bosmon and yzen were looking at http://casperjs.org/
2013-12-03T16:35:25 <colinclark> as a way of doing web-level acceptance testing
2013-12-03T16:37:42 <colinclark> It would be really great to have a stable instance of TestSwarm up one of these days
2013-12-03T16:38:21 <Justin_o> colinclark: looks good... how close are things like Phantomjs to real thing?
2013-12-03T16:38:43 <colinclark> As far as I know, PhantomJS is just WebKit
2013-12-03T16:39:01 <colinclark> I guess the question being, "which WebKit?"
2013-12-03T16:39:19 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes
2013-12-03T16:39:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: also avtar has an alternative to testswarm, but i keep forgetting what it\'s called.. i think google makes it, but can\'t quite remember
2013-12-03T16:40:01 <colinclark> interesting
2013-12-03T16:40:07 <colinclark> does it have any particular advantages?
2013-12-03T16:40:21 <colinclark> Has TestSwarm development stalled recently, or is it still going?
2013-12-03T16:44:10 <colinclark> Looks like PhantomJS is fairly vague about what version of WebKit they use, so it suggests that it should be treated as a kind of "generic browser platform" for testing, Justin_o
2013-12-03T16:44:26 <colinclark> whereas SlimerJS at least lets you choose a particular version of Firefox to run with
2013-12-03T16:48:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s a hand feature
2013-12-03T16:48:57 <Justin_o> handy
2013-12-03T16:53:52 * Guest18677 has quit
2013-12-03T16:55:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: I haven\'t followed testswarm development lately so not sure where they are.. i remember the alternative sounding promising though in providing what we\'d need, including ways to spin up browsers on a machine and ways to connect remotely. I think testswarm was moving away from some of these things with their move to browserstack.
2013-12-03T16:56:07 <colinclark> right
2013-12-03T16:56:09 <colinclark> that\'s pretty interesting

2013-12-03T21:13:21 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\'ve issued a pull request for FLUID-5217, the folder restructuring: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/444  Not sure who should/could review it?

2013-12-03T21:18:55 <colinclark> hey Bosmon
2013-12-03T21:19:03 <Bosmon> colinclark
2013-12-03T21:19:19 <colinclark> It was late last night when I saw your channel chat with yzen
2013-12-03T21:19:28 <colinclark> I pointed out CasperJS to Justin_o this morning
2013-12-03T21:19:50 <colinclark> I\'m curious; in the case of the new features in Kettle, what might the CasperJS tests look like?
2013-12-03T21:19:51 <Bosmon> I saw
2013-12-03T21:19:56 <colinclark> What kinds of things would they do?
2013-12-03T21:20:44 <Bosmon> They would issue browser code using the HTML5 websockets API which would connect to an appropriately configured Kettle server via localhost
2013-12-03T21:21:07 <Bosmon> And verify that the support that we have written in Kettle actually matches the wire protocol that an Websockets client expects
2013-12-03T21:23:03 <Bosmon> E.g. the test case would issue var socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost .... ) etc.
2013-12-03T21:23:52 <Bosmon> And then check functionality of the connection using the standard event-based API (onopen, send, onmessage) etc.
2013-12-03T21:24:10 <Bosmon> This would probably also be a good candidate for being wrapped in using the IoC testing framework on the client side
2013-12-03T21:26:43 * michelled has quit
2013-12-03T21:27:59 <Bosmon> Without tests of this kind, our only assurance that kettle\'s socket.io support was actually working would be based on observing that "it works in practice" or "it doesn\'t work in practice"
2013-12-03T21:28:28 <Bosmon> We have "internal tests" for kettle socket.io, but these rely only on consistency between two different APIs for node.js, which may or may not agree with what in practice is operated by a browser
2013-12-03T21:28:53 <Bosmon> Does this make sense?
2013-12-03T21:30:06 * jhung has quit
2013-12-03T21:30:15 <colinclark> sorry, just catching up
2013-12-03T21:30:43 <colinclark> Yes, this makes perfect sense, Bosmon
2013-12-03T21:31:02 <colinclark> I\'m realizing that the key point is that WebSockets represent a browser-level dependency
2013-12-03T21:31:26 <colinclark> they\'re not "just sockets" and need to be tested end-to-end via the APIs in a real browser
2013-12-03T21:31:31 * jhung joined the channel
2013-12-03T21:31:59 <colinclark> Do you think we\'ll actually dive into CasperJS before long?

2013-12-03T21:55:32 <Bosmon> I would hope we would
2013-12-03T21:55:38 <Bosmon> It seems like a generally invaluable technology
2013-12-03T21:56:19 <Bosmon> Although it can\'t really substitute for "actual browser simulation" as per doh robot etc.
2013-12-03T21:56:29 <Bosmon> But it is a lot better than a poke in the yee
2013-12-03T21:56:31 <Bosmon> eye
2013-12-03T21:56:47 <Bosmon> As we know, there is a certain "residual smear" of things in a browser that can\'t be adequately simulated
2013-12-03T21:56:58 <Bosmon> In terms of certain kinds of keystrokes or focus events etc.
