2013-09-30T19:35:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a proper way to have regex in json
2013-09-30T19:35:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no
2013-09-30T19:35:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you describe your use case?
2013-09-30T19:35:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the string replacement
2013-09-30T19:36:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that seems a little insane
2013-09-30T19:36:21 <Justin_o> i was hoping to also support regex but you can\'t specify them in transformation spec
2013-09-30T19:36:27 <Bosmon> I thought you were going to use Fluid\'s string templater
2013-09-30T19:37:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: lneresting.. how would that work for transformations though.. since they won\'t be tokenized.. or is there a generic form of the stringTemplate i can use
2013-09-30T19:38:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you describe which part of the system requires general string replacement?
2013-09-30T19:38:35 <Bosmon> Isn\'t it just a matter of adding prefixes? Plus the use of your existing "." to "_" replacement?
2013-09-30T19:40:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so this is for rebasing the protoTrees.. for change to handle the new selectors.. i\'ve done that with the standard value transform... but I\'ll also have to change the model paths, and IoC references in the prototrees as well
2013-09-30T19:40:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can\'t you use model relay to take care of the model paths? And arrange for the IoC references to remain stable?
2013-09-30T19:40:43 <Justin_o> since the old prototree will have refered to model values in the subPanel, which have different paths in the parent.. and similarly references to {that} will need to be rebound to the correct component
2013-09-30T19:41:05 <Bosmon> I see
2013-09-30T19:41:11 <Bosmon> Why is {that} no longer the correct component?
2013-09-30T19:41:21 <Bosmon> Surely all panels still mean themselves when they refer to themselves :)
2013-09-30T19:41:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it wont\' be correct in the parentPanel which is the one doing the rendering
2013-09-30T19:42:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you will have to "make it correct" - what\'s the alternative?
2013-09-30T19:42:30 <Justin_o> {that} will need to be changed to refer to the subPanel instead, or else it will reference the parent panel
2013-09-30T19:42:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I suggest you deal with this issue by expanding the protoTrees by hand
2013-09-30T19:43:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. what does that mean exactly.. changing them into the fully hydrated form?
2013-09-30T19:43:28 <Bosmon> There\'s no need to pervert the meaning of the configuration because we have a broken Renderer : P
2013-09-30T19:44:13 <Justin_o> how would i go about expanding the prototree manually?
2013-09-30T19:44:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, all you really need to do is just call the "produceTree" member of the subcoponents by hand
2013-09-30T19:44:30 <Bosmon> And then collect the results together
2013-09-30T19:45:23 <Bosmon> Optionally calling the results of "expander" on the output
2013-09-30T19:45:45 <Bosmon> Just follow the workflow of fluid.renderer.createRendererSubcomponent, after all you wrote most of it yourself : P
2013-09-30T19:46:55 <Justin_o> :) okay.. and then i\'d just change the selectors to use those from the parent instead
2013-09-30T19:47:08 <Bosmon> yes
2013-09-30T19:47:18 <Bosmon> And that should just be a matter of adding scoping to them
2013-09-30T19:48:27 <Justin_o> okay great thanks.. i\'ve been stumbling over this for a bit.. i\'ll do this instead now

b'2013-09-30T17:51:50 <jhernandez> yes, you can install any package
2013-09-30T17:52:03 <jhernandez> first, you have to retrieve its id
2013-09-30T17:52:54 <clown> yes.
2013-09-30T17:53:06 <jhernandez> from your pastebin:
2013-09-30T17:53:08 <jhernandez> {
2013-09-30T17:53:08 <jhernandez> "id": "gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu;3.8.4-1.fc19;noarch;updates",
2013-09-30T17:53:11 <jhernandez> "name": "gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu",
2013-09-30T17:53:14 <jhernandez> "version": "3.8.4-1.fc19",
2013-09-30T17:53:17 <jhernandez> "data": "updates"
2013-09-30T17:53:19 <jhernandez> }
2013-09-30T17:53:25 <clown> yup.
2013-09-30T17:53:35 <jhernandez> if you want to install it, just add into your test file something like
2013-09-30T17:53:52 <jhernandez> packagekit.installPackage("gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu;3.8.4-1.fc19;noarch;updates");
2013-09-30T17:54:29 <jhernandez> in my case, I have to run it twice before getting the "enter admin password" dialog
2013-09-30T17:55:43 <clown> but, I could call packagekit.installPackage(\xe2\x80\xa6) inside my node interptretter, right?  (after the necessary require(\'./build/Release/nodepackagekit.node\'\') ).
2013-09-30T17:55:51 <jhernandez> we can also add a statuscallback and logging what\'s happening
2013-09-30T17:56:57 <jhernandez> but it\'s ok as it is right now
2013-09-30T17:57:29 <clown> rats!  My Vm just crashed.  Hang on...
2013-09-30T17:58:21 <jhernandez> heh! that\'s the reason I always use my own system before trying it on Fedora :P
2013-09-30T18:01:26 <jhernandez> clown: sorry, and yes, you can also call it from the node interpreter
2013-09-30T18:02:41 <jhernandez> btw, when uninstalling, you should search again for the package because the id will be different this time
2013-09-30T18:03:13 <clown> why is the id different (vm is back, trying the install command out).
2013-09-30T18:04:04 <jhernandez> \'id\' and \'data\' now should reflect that the package is already installed
2013-09-30T18:05:01 <jhernandez> insteadof updates, they will contain "installed:updates"
2013-09-30T18:05:02 <clown> right.  data either says "installed" or something else if not installed.
2013-09-30T18:05:12 * jhernandez nods
2013-09-30T18:05:30 <clown> okay, I\'ve run the package.installPackage (\xe2\x80\xa6) once so far.
2013-09-30T18:05:37 <jhernandez> so, what about the bug
2013-09-30T18:05:38 * clown checking to see if anything installed.
2013-09-30T18:05:46 <jhernandez> is the same under fedora?
2013-09-30T18:06:00 <jhernandez> ok ok
2013-09-30T18:07:02 <clown> it says it is installed  (I did a "yum info gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu") before and after running packagekit.installedPackage().
2013-09-30T18:07:36 <jhernandez> so ... does it means that it worked the first time?
2013-09-30T18:07:40 <clown> yes.
2013-09-30T18:07:42 <jhernandez> nice!
2013-09-30T18:07:44 <clown> I presume
2013-09-30T18:08:06 * jhernandez grabs a beer ...
2013-09-30T18:08:15 <jhernandez> :P
2013-09-30T18:08:16 <clown> step 1.  yum info gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu =>  "Available packages\xe2\x80\xa6."
2013-09-30T18:09:01 <clown> step 2.  node; packagekit.installPackage(\'gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu;3.8.4-1.fc19;noarch;updates\') ==>  "true".
2013-09-30T18:09:20 <clown> step 3.  yum info gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu ==> "Installed packages \xe2\x80\xa6".
2013-09-30T18:09:34 <jhernandez> yay!
2013-09-30T18:09:39 * clown grabs his mug and toasts jhernandez.
2013-09-30T18:09:50 <jhernandez> now, it\'s time to remove it
2013-09-30T18:09:56 <jhernandez> xDD
2013-09-30T18:10:00 <clown> step 4, coming up...
2013-09-30T18:11:06 * greggy has quit
2013-09-30T18:11:07 <jhernandez> search for the package again, and call packagekit.removePackage("the-new-id");
2013-09-30T18:11:40 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-09-30T18:11:45 <clown> how do I search?  Use packagekit.searchPackage()?
2013-09-30T18:11:52 * jhernandez nods
2013-09-30T18:12:17 <jhernandez> packagekit.searchPackage("gnome-shell-extension-alternative-status-menu")
2013-09-30T18:12:32 <jhernandez> you\'ll get a shorter list :P
2013-09-30T18:12:42 <clown> I did something wrong:  got "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
2013-09-30T18:12:59 <clown> node just blew up and went away.
2013-09-30T18:13:13 <jhernandez> clown: you bad guy! xDDD
2013-09-30T18:13:17 * clown tries again.

2013-09-30T18:13:35 * clown is actually snidely whiplash
2013-09-30T18:14:17 * clown wonders why we chose a package with such a looooooong name.
2013-09-30T18:14:24 <jhernandez> haha
2013-09-30T18:14:56 <clown> this time, no core dump, and got the package id.
2013-09-30T18:15:10 <jhernandez> cool!
2013-09-30T18:15:35 <jhernandez> packagekit.removePackage("the-new-package-id");
2013-09-30T18:15:42 <clown> and up pops a dialog asking for my password.
2013-09-30T18:15:48 <jhernandez> nice!
2013-09-30T18:15:59 <clown> "Authentication is required to remove packages"
2013-09-30T18:16:04 <clown> I\'m not sure that\'s nice.
2013-09-30T18:16:22 <clown> I see the reason, but if you a fully automated system, ...
2013-09-30T18:16:46 <clown> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6.  I entered my password, and hit return.  And, my VM died.
2013-09-30T18:16:56 <clown> *sigh*
2013-09-30T18:17:00 <jhernandez> crap
2013-09-30T18:17:28 <jhernandez> but, who died? the VM, or just the viewer?
2013-09-30T18:17:32 * clown thinks it has to do with the fancy opengl overlays and transparencies with thes dialogs.
2013-09-30T18:17:36 <clown> the entire VM.
2013-09-30T18:17:42 <jhernandez> :(
2013-09-30T18:17:46 <clown> ditto.
2013-09-30T18:18:04 * clown blames virtual box.
2013-09-30T18:18:30 * jhernandez ++
2013-09-30T18:18:32 * clown blames virtual box\'es virtual video driver
2013-09-30T18:18:47 * jhernandez ++
2013-09-30T18:18:57 <jhernandez> btw, I use qemu/kvm
2013-09-30T18:18:59 <jhernandez> :P
2013-09-30T18:20:13 * clown will look into qemu/kvm to see if it\'s more stable.
2013-09-30T18:23:23 <clown> well, it killed the VM again, right after I entered my password and hit return.
2013-09-30T18:23:44 <clown> I am going to set this up on a real machine, jhernandez
2013-09-30T18:24:05 <clown> But that will take a few minutes.  About 15 or so.
2013-09-30T18:24:12 <clown> I\'ll let you know\xe2\x80\xa6.
2013-09-30T18:25:30 <jhernandez> ok
2013-09-30T18:25:31 <jhernandez> meanwhile, could you check if the package was removed (before your VM crash)?
2013-09-30T18:27:24 * clown1 joined the channel

2013-09-30T18:44:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, what do you think of what i have so far for FLUID-5131 https://github.com/jobara/infusion/compare/FLUID-5131
2013-09-30T18:47:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looking reasonable so far, at a quick look
2013-09-30T18:49:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. i\'m trying to use model transformations for rebasing the prototrees from the subpanels to the parent panel
2013-09-30T18:49:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it would be ok to do that for hand by now
2013-09-30T18:49:36 <Bosmon> This code won\'t have an extremely long lifetime
2013-09-30T18:50:01 <Justin_o> for that i\'m trying to write a new transformation that just does a simple string replacement.. i couldn\'t find one that did this already, is there one? also are there any docs on how to write a transformation?
2013-09-30T18:50:15 * jhung has quit
2013-09-30T18:50:45 <Justin_o> i wonder if it would be easier to write with the model transformation though?
2013-09-30T18:51:08 <Justin_o> since i\'ll have to rebase the selector names used in the protoTree, the model paths, and IoC references
2013-09-30T18:51:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2013-09-30T18:52:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - a string replacement transformation could be interesting
2013-09-30T18:53:07 <clown> jhernandez:  yes:  La lluvia en Sevilla es una pura maravilla
2013-09-30T18:53:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i figure it would have to be really simple as the inverse would be difficult to perform if it accepted regexp
2013-09-30T18:53:31 <Bosmon> clown - marvellous :)
2013-09-30T18:53:40 * clown blushes
2013-09-30T18:53:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no need to make it invertible
2013-09-30T18:53:58 <Bosmon> There can be such a thing as "doing a job too thoroughly"
2013-09-30T18:54:04 <Bosmon> I can refer you to colinclark here
2013-09-30T18:54:10 <Bosmon> Who has a particular slogan that covers these things : P
2013-09-30T18:54:11 <Justin_o> :)
2013-09-30T18:54:25 <colinclark> SHIP. IT.
2013-09-30T18:55:16 <clown> jhernandez:  I set it all up on a real machine.  It installed with one call.  And the one call to removePackage() removed it.
2013-09-30T18:57:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t suppose there are docs on how to write the transformations?
2013-09-30T18:57:39 <clown> brb
2013-09-30T19:05:44 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2013-09-30T19:06:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there is only this http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions
2013-09-30T19:06:16 <Bosmon> Written by **KASPPARNETT**
2013-09-30T19:06:30 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli!
2013-09-30T19:06:36 <cindyli> not sure if you paid attention to an issue that Chris sent to the gpii architecture list regarding the dynamic language switching.
2013-09-30T19:06:44 <cindyli> this is the email: http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2013-September/001375.html
2013-09-30T19:07:04 <cindyli> in specific from line "All message .json files will be grouped in locale-specific folders named.." onwards
2013-09-30T19:07:15 * clown is back
2013-09-30T19:07:54 <Bosmon> What totally hideous code Chris is writing
2013-09-30T19:07:58 <Bosmon> Isn\'t anyone looking after him? : P
2013-09-30T19:08:22 <cindyli> Justin_o started refractoring his code
2013-09-30T19:08:33 <Bosmon> Sure, but talking to him would be a help too :)
2013-09-30T19:09:06 <cindyli> ya, we can do that. hopfully Chris can refer to Justin_o\'s code for some improvements
2013-09-30T19:11:20 <cindyli> Bosmon: i don\'t think our current UIO design supports dynamic message bundle re-loading. any suggestions to help Chris with this language switching issue?
2013-09-30T19:11:36 <Bosmon> cindyli - the approach seems fine - the entire component will need to be re-rendered
2013-09-30T19:12:12 <cindyli> Bosmon: you mean Chris\' approach to passing a global variable into the aux schema?
2013-09-30T19:12:32 <Bosmon> No, not that part :)
2013-09-30T19:12:44 <Bosmon> global variable indeed ....
2013-09-30T19:20:32 <jhernandez> clown: re "La lluvia en Sevilla es una pura maravilla" LOL
2013-09-30T19:20:58 <jhernandez> re "installed with one call.  And the one call to removePackage() removed it" awesome!!!
2013-09-30T19:21:24 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you mean "the re-rendering of the entire component" is to re-run the uio builder with the another message prefix that points to the switched language message files?
2013-09-30T19:22:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - it shouldn\'t be necessary to rebuild the component
2013-09-30T19:22:13 <Bosmon> Simply reinstantiating it with different options should be sufficient
2013-09-30T19:22:48 <clown> jhernandez:  I think I should try again with another package.  Sample size of 1 is not definitive.
2013-09-30T19:24:49 <cindyli> ah ok, i think now i have some clues. thanks, Bosmon
2013-09-30T19:26:13 <jhernandez> clown: btw, right now, we can just deal with one package at a time

2013-09-30T16:27:20 <clown> for the GPII stuff, anyhow.
2013-09-30T16:27:33 <clown> sure jhernandez.  Push away.  I can look at it.

2013-09-30T16:47:24 * mrvisser has quit
2013-09-30T16:50:44 <jhernandez> clown: https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/tree/packagekitBridge
2013-09-30T16:54:14 <jhernandez> the issue is that I have to call \'installPackage\' twice to get it working, the same for \'removePackage\' method
2013-09-30T16:56:48 * clown is back.
2013-09-30T16:56:54 <clown> jhernandez:  *looking*
2013-09-30T16:57:03 <jhernandez> clown: super-fast lunch!?
2013-09-30T16:58:04 <clown> jhernandez:   no, I was getting my lunch.  It is sitting beside me here.  I plan to eat and look at your stuff at the same time.
2013-09-30T16:58:10 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-09-30T17:02:43 <jhernandez> clown: no prob, I can wait
2013-09-30T17:03:50 <jhernandez> I\'ll be here for a couple of hours more or less
2013-09-30T17:04:15 <jhernandez> anyway, if you want to put your hands on it, it\'s easy
2013-09-30T17:04:34 <jhernandez> build it -> node-gyp configure build
2013-09-30T17:04:51 <clown> jhernandez:  remind me of the git commands to download it.
2013-09-30T17:04:56 <jhernandez> heh
2013-09-30T17:04:58 <clown> please.
2013-09-30T17:05:24 <jhernandez> git remote add javihernandez git://github.com/javihernandez/linux.git
2013-09-30T17:05:31 <jhernandez> git fetch -a -v javihernandez
2013-09-30T17:05:57 <jhernandez> git checkout javihernandez/packagekitBridge -b packagekitBridge
2013-09-30T17:05:58 <clown> I already have (based on git config):  remote.origin.url=git://github.com/javihernandez/linux/
2013-09-30T17:06:03 <jhernandez> ok
2013-09-30T17:06:22 <jhernandez> then, update it by using fetch
2013-09-30T17:06:23 <clown> is that the same thing as what you wrote above?  (git remote add ...)
2013-09-30T17:06:29 <jhernandez> yup
2013-09-30T17:06:44 <clown> okay.  fetching\xe2\x80\xa6.
2013-09-30T17:08:30 <clown> "fatal: \'javihernandez\' does not appear to be a git repository
2013-09-30T17:08:30 <clown> fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
2013-09-30T17:08:30 <clown> Please make sure you have the correct access rights
2013-09-30T17:08:30 <clown> and the repository exists."
2013-09-30T17:08:52 <clown> weird...
2013-09-30T17:10:33 <clown> okay, the fetch works now.  I *did* have to do the \'git remote add\' above.
2013-09-30T17:10:57 * jhernandez has quit
2013-09-30T17:12:29 * jhernandez joined the channel
2013-09-30T17:12:45 <jhernandez> clown: connection issues ... :/
2013-09-30T17:13:12 <jhernandez> fetched it?
2013-09-30T17:14:12 <clown> yes, jhernandez, I fetched it.
2013-09-30T17:14:33 <clown> I did have to add the remote \xe2\x80\x94 the \'git add remote \xe2\x80\xa6\' you suggested above.
2013-09-30T17:14:40 <jhernandez> ok
2013-09-30T17:15:41 <clown> jhernandez:  looks like it built.
2013-09-30T17:15:45 <jhernandez> change into packagekitBridge branch
2013-09-30T17:15:58 <jhernandez> cd into node_modules/packagekit
2013-09-30T17:16:07 <clown> did that a while ago (while you were disconnected). :-)
2013-09-30T17:16:09 <jhernandez> node-gyp configure build
2013-09-30T17:16:33 <jhernandez> ok ok
2013-09-30T17:16:34 <clown> oh, okay.  I just ran build.sh from the main linux directory.  Was that wrong?
2013-09-30T17:17:10 <jhernandez> stop it
2013-09-30T17:17:24 <clown> it finshed a while ago.
2013-09-30T17:17:34 <jhernandez> we\'d like to use the node module directly
2013-09-30T17:17:53 <clown> actually, no, it isn\'t finished.  It\'s waiting for my password.  Time for cntl-c.
2013-09-30T17:18:11 <jhernandez> yup, we just want to deal with the module itself

2013-09-30T17:20:09 * clown loves the final gyp error:  "not ok".
2013-09-30T17:20:32 <clown> but, the culprit is no build.gyp.
2013-09-30T17:20:43 <jhernandez> oh! crap!
2013-09-30T17:20:43 <jhernandez> wait
2013-09-30T17:21:36 <clown> pardon me "binding.gyp".
2013-09-30T17:21:40 <jhernandez> clown: heh, cd into nodepackagekit
2013-09-30T17:21:42 <clown> but there is one...
2013-09-30T17:21:46 <jhernandez> xD
2013-09-30T17:21:48 * jhernandez nods
2013-09-30T17:21:51 <clown> yup, I\'m there.
2013-09-30T17:22:37 * clown takes bite of sandwich.
2013-09-30T17:25:27 <jhernandez> gyp info ok ?
2013-09-30T17:25:51 <clown> dunno \xe2\x80\x94 the last thing you asked me to do was cd into nodepackagekit.
2013-09-30T17:25:56 <jhernandez> good sandwich?
2013-09-30T17:25:57 <jhernandez> heh
2013-09-30T17:25:58 <jhernandez> ok
2013-09-30T17:26:04 <jhernandez> build it
2013-09-30T17:26:04 <clown> yes, It is delicious.  Want a bite?
2013-09-30T17:26:41 <jhernandez> node-gyp configure build and enjoy another bite xDDD
2013-09-30T17:26:42 <clown> okay, it\'s built!  Why did it work this time?
2013-09-30T17:27:04 <clown> oh, I was in the wrong directory.
2013-09-30T17:27:08 <clown> before.
2013-09-30T17:27:17 * jhernandez nods
2013-09-30T17:27:28 * clown looks at the js test file.
2013-09-30T17:27:53 * clown tries to run test file.
2013-09-30T17:28:26 <jhernandez> clown: nice! let me see the output, please
2013-09-30T17:29:36 <clown> [
2013-09-30T17:29:36 <clown> {
2013-09-30T17:29:36 <clown> "id": "orca;3.8.1-1.fc19;x86_64;installed:koji-override-0",

2013-09-30T17:29:37 <clown> }
2013-09-30T17:29:38 <clown> ]
2013-09-30T17:30:03 <clown> jhernandez ^
2013-09-30T17:30:14 <jhernandez> cool!
2013-09-30T17:30:21 <clown> I ran it just once.
2013-09-30T17:30:30 <jhernandez> I\'m wondering if there\'s a orca-lang package for Fedora
2013-09-30T17:30:35 * jhernandez looks
2013-09-30T17:30:40 <clown> there was about a 5 sec delay before the answer came back.
2013-09-30T17:31:27 <clown> I assume the delay is because package-kit is asking for info from a remote repository (via yum) ?
2013-09-30T17:31:39 <jhernandez> clown: you\'re right
2013-09-30T17:31:50 * clown looks at .cc file.
2013-09-30T17:32:06 <jhernandez> ok, orca-lang seems to be specific for openSUSE
2013-09-30T17:32:32 <clown> okay, so we have init(), install(), and remove().  But, no "what is available?" type commands.
2013-09-30T17:32:40 <jhernandez> heh
2013-09-30T17:32:54 <jhernandez> "data": "installed:koji-override-0"
2013-09-30T17:33:07 <clown> yes?
2013-09-30T17:33:12 <clown> what about that line?
2013-09-30T17:33:33 <jhernandez> if you replace orca by another word, ie: gnome-shell
2013-09-30T17:33:40 * clown tries that...
2013-09-30T17:34:27 <jhernandez> you\'ll see how you can differ from installed and not-installed packages
2013-09-30T17:35:05 <clown> you get a whole pile of info.
2013-09-30T17:36:17 <clown> pastebin.ca/2460210
2013-09-30T17:36:36 <clown> jhernandez ^
2013-09-30T17:37:07 <jhernandez> cool!
2013-09-30T17:37:19 <clown> you appear to get all the infomation about the gnome-extensions.
2013-09-30T17:37:23 <clown> is that what we want?
2013-09-30T17:37:28 <jhernandez> there, you have all installed and available packages
2013-09-30T17:38:21 <jhernandez> installed ones are those who have the \'installed\' word on \'data\' field
2013-09-30T17:38:31 * clown nods
2013-09-30T17:39:42 <clown> uninstalled ones give the name of the repository?  example:  "updates"  or "fedora".
2013-09-30T17:40:45 <jhernandez> the \'id\' is the id you have to pass to  installPackage and removePackage methods
2013-09-30T17:41:06 * clown nods  (I actually knew that).
2013-09-30T17:41:18 <jhernandez> so by having this module, we can return customized JSON objects to the deviceReporter about a certain package
2013-09-30T17:41:25 * clown sighs because he has run out of sandwich.
2013-09-30T17:41:38 <clown> yes, it is good.
2013-09-30T17:41:39 <jhernandez> install and remove packages
2013-09-30T17:42:40 * jhernandez nods
2013-09-30T17:43:03 <clown> but what about the "you have to call it twice" bug?  Is that just on openSuse?
2013-09-30T17:43:21 <jhernandez> re the bug, if you can, go and install one package
2013-09-30T17:43:43 <jhernandez> that was the next stop ;)
2013-09-30T17:43:43 <jhernandez> *step
2013-09-30T17:44:04 <clown> can it be any package?
2013-09-30T17:46:06 <clown> is there a yum command to ask for the dependencies on a package?  I want to try install out on something that has little or no dependencies.
2013-09-30T17:46:21 <jhernandez> go into a node interactive console
2013-09-30T17:46:21 <jhernandez> (by running: node)
2013-09-30T17:47:40 <clown> ok, I\'m there.
2013-09-30T17:51:13 <jhernandez> sorry, lot of lag here ...
2013-09-30T17:51:18 <clown> no problem.

2013-09-30T13:37:08 <cindyli> Justin_o: do you mean for UIO message bundle? It is using lookup.
2013-09-30T13:38:58 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes. wondering if we should have used resolve instead.. for things like sliding panel where it does a straight lookup.. so that we don\'t have to do all the conditional checks\xe2\x80\xa6 i suppose we\'d still need it for converting the namespaces values to arrays though

2013-09-30T14:36:53 * michelled joined the channel
2013-09-30T14:40:14 <Justin_o> yzen_: can you remind me what the ${} means in renderer proto trees
2013-09-30T14:40:27 <yzen_> valuebinding afaik
2013-09-30T14:40:46 <Justin_o> yzen_: okay.. and can you just do {} or that\'s not accepted?
2013-09-30T14:40:50 <yzen_> so resolves to {value binding: path } ?
2013-09-30T14:41:01 <yzen_> {} all just get expanded as ioc ?
2013-09-30T14:41:04 <yzen_> will
2013-09-30T14:41:38 <Justin_o> so something like ${value} points to a model value.. and ${{value}} would try to valuebind an IoC reference
2013-09-30T14:41:44 <Justin_o> yzen_: ^
2013-09-30T14:42:32 <yzen_> Justin_o: hmm i might be confused but i think the latter expression actually resolves to value somehow in the tree
2013-09-30T14:43:00 <Justin_o> yzen_: in the proto tree.. you mean? like for a pathas or valueas
2013-09-30T14:43:23 <yzen_> Justin_o: yes
2013-09-30T14:43:53 <Justin_o> yzen_: okay thanks.. i think that\'s cleared things up for me.. by the way, do you know much about how the model transformations work?
2013-09-30T14:44:24 <yzen_> Justin_o: well i know a little, but in the gpii world kasper is the exper
2013-09-30T14:44:25 <yzen_> t
2013-09-30T14:45:40 <Justin_o> yzen_: ah right
2013-09-30T14:54:08 <jhernandez> clown_mtg: ping
2013-09-30T14:54:53 <jhernandez> yzen_: hey!
2013-09-30T15:03:59 * avtar joined the channel
2013-09-30T15:09:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: here\'s a test branch for changing from the lookup function to resolve https://github.com/jobara/infusion/compare/resolve
2013-09-30T15:09:22 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure if there is a performance hit by doing this or not
2013-09-30T15:10:15 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, it looks good
2013-09-30T15:16:10 <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. now that i\'m thinking about it, maybe it\'s wrong.. since it resolves it in place.. we wouldn\'t want a string template resolved into the strings object of a component as it may need to be resolved where it\'s used.. so perhpas it\'s not correct to attach this to the strings block but to use the call to resolve where the string is actually used.
2013-09-30T15:16:10 <Justin_o> What do you think?
2013-09-30T15:21:54 <clown_mtg> jhernandez:  sorry in a meeting, right now.  I\'ll be in touch later.  In about 45 minutes.  Ok?
2013-09-30T15:22:01 <cindyli> Justin_o: seems to me that the places where string templates are resolved are where they are actually used.
2013-09-30T15:24:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. so it would make sense to use the resolve function where they are used then.. but i\'m wondering what the effect will be if something is in the strings block and also in the parent bundle
2013-09-30T15:26:07 <cindyli> Justin_o: what do you mean "something is in the strings block and also in the parent bundle"? what\'s the conflict?
2013-09-30T15:27:34 <Justin_o> so lets say for the sliding panel we have a default value in the strings block.. and then we want to override it from UIO
2013-09-30T15:28:45 <cindyli> ok, i see. in that case we need a pre-handling on "strings" before the rendering
2013-09-30T15:29:04 <cindyli> depending on the existence of the parent bundle
2013-09-30T15:31:25 <cindyli> Justin_o: is there a way to re-boil an event with a different argument? for example, this line defines "onReady: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/FatPanelUIOptions.js#L139
2013-09-30T15:31:41 <cindyli> sorry, didn\'t finish the typing
2013-09-30T15:32:02 <cindyli> this line defines the "onReady" event in uiOptions and fatPanel are equivalent
2013-09-30T15:32:35 <cindyli> so when I hook up a listener for fatPenal -> onReady: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/FatPanelUIOptions.js#L38
2013-09-30T15:34:04 <cindyli> the argument I get is "uiOptions". so I want to re-boil fatPanel -> onReady to retrieve a "fatPanel" object
2013-09-30T15:34:38 <cindyli> Justin_o: can we do that?
2013-09-30T15:36:38 <jhernandez> clown_mtg: sure! ;)
2013-09-30T15:48:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. where did you want to do the boiling?
2013-09-30T15:48:47 <Justin_o> or you want to change how line 139 of FatPanelUIOptions is written
2013-09-30T15:49:18 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m thinking to change line 38: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/FatPanelUIOptions.js#L38
2013-09-30T15:49:53 <cindyli> of course, if changing 139 achieves the goal, let\'s do it
2013-09-30T15:50:21 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. i think changing it on line 139 would be better since you can just add in the arg you want there..
2013-09-30T15:50:33 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2013-09-30T15:50:41 <cindyli> ah. ok. trying
2013-09-30T15:51:26 * yzen__ joined the channel
2013-09-30T15:51:55 * clown_mtg has quit
2013-09-30T15:52:33 * yzen_ has quit
2013-09-30T15:59:37 <Justin_o> yzen: do you know if there is way to do string manipulation in model transformations?
2013-09-30T16:12:14 * clown joined the channel
2013-09-30T16:12:43 <clown> jhernandez:  my meeting is done.  what\'s up?
2013-09-30T16:15:15 <jhernandez> clown: here!
2013-09-30T16:15:28 <clown> hi jhernandez!
2013-09-30T16:15:51 <jhernandez> hi!
2013-09-30T16:16:27 <jhernandez> just wanted to give you an update about the packagekit stuff
2013-09-30T16:16:34 * amilchev has left the channel
2013-09-30T16:16:36 <clown> okay, thanks.
2013-09-30T16:16:39 <clown> much appreciated.
2013-09-30T16:17:57 <jhernandez> i read your mails and after reading (and playing) a bit with packagekit through dbus
2013-09-30T16:18:15 <clown> yes? ...
2013-09-30T16:20:14 <jhernandez> seems that we need to call pk\'s system interface, create a transaction (with a private and unique object id) and then use this to call our session interface
2013-09-30T16:20:55 <jhernandez> I got it working, but it\'s very confusing
2013-09-30T16:20:58 <jhernandez> so
2013-09-30T16:21:01 <clown> aha.  Makes sense \xe2\x80\x94 you don\'t get access to the Transaction dbus interface unless you create an instance of a Transaction?
2013-09-30T16:21:07 <jhernandez> yup
2013-09-30T16:21:16 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-09-30T16:21:33 <jhernandez> so I decided to stop using dbus and use libpackagekit instead
2013-09-30T16:22:00 <clown> actually, that\'s similar to the magnifier dbus interface.  There are ZoomRegion dbus objects, but unless you ask the magnfier dbus object to creat one, you can\'t access it.
2013-09-30T16:22:13 <jhernandez> yep
2013-09-30T16:22:28 <clown> www.packagekit.org/gtk-doc/libpackagekit-gobject.html?
2013-09-30T16:22:35 <jhernandez> so about using libpackagekit, it sounds creepy, but sgithens already started working on it
2013-09-30T16:22:39 <jhernandez> AND
2013-09-30T16:23:07 <jhernandez> I took his work and finished it
2013-09-30T16:23:09 <jhernandez> :]
2013-09-30T16:23:24 <clown> why is that creepy?
2013-09-30T16:23:27 <clown> :-)
2013-09-30T16:23:55 <jhernandez> because we need to write our own node.js module
2013-09-30T16:24:01 <michelled> colinclark: I just found out from yzen that the things that are holding up the GPII 0.2 release are two pull requests to Infusion. One is from Bosmon for FLUID-5089 and the other is from Kasper
2013-09-30T16:24:22 <colinclark> looking up FLUID-5089
2013-09-30T16:24:30 <michelled> given that Kasper isn\'t back until next week, we probably aren\'t in any huge rush
2013-09-30T16:24:30 <clown> jhernandez:  by "module" you mean node.js add-on?  Add-ons are written in C++ and extend the functionality of node.js
2013-09-30T16:24:34 <colinclark> oh yes, that one
2013-09-30T16:24:38 <jhernandez> clown: yup
2013-09-30T16:24:44 <colinclark> How is that one a blocker, michelled
2013-09-30T16:24:45 <colinclark> ?
2013-09-30T16:24:46 <michelled> but it would be good to get these in so when he\'s back we can do the release
2013-09-30T16:24:51 <clown> s\'okay with me, jhernandez.
2013-09-30T16:24:52 <jhernandez> but it\'s already written
2013-09-30T16:25:02 <michelled> yzen: do you know why the release is blocked on those pulls?
2013-09-30T16:25:02 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2013-09-30T16:25:03 <jhernandez> that\'s the good news
2013-09-30T16:25:10 <colinclark> I would have thought "making it work on Windows" might be part of the requirements for 0.2
2013-09-30T16:25:16 <clown> jhernandez:  sounds like there is bad  news.
2013-09-30T16:25:18 <jhernandez> so right now we can search, install and uninstall packages :]
2013-09-30T16:25:19 <colinclark> but perhaps our Windows ThinkPad just sucks
2013-09-30T16:26:03 <clown> go on, jhernandez.
2013-09-30T16:26:04 <jhernandez> clown: heh
2013-09-30T16:26:25 <jhernandez> it doesn\'t works always :S
2013-09-30T16:26:26 <jhernandez> xDD
2013-09-30T16:26:50 <jhernandez> but seems to be a packagekit issue (at least under opensuse 12.3)
2013-09-30T16:26:51 <clown> jhernandez:  that\'s something for me to work on!  Maybe I can fix it?  (and maybe not...)
