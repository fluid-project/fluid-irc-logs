2013-08-27T18:12:27 <jhung> heidiv: I did some more testing in IE9. The vertical scroll would appear if the panel is open and then resized. If you then close the panel and re-open, the vertical scroll disappears.
2013-08-27T18:13:02 <heidiv> jhung weird! ok
2013-08-27T18:13:28 <jhung> I'm going to test IE10 now heidiv.
2013-08-27T18:13:49 <heidiv> k thanks jhung
2013-08-27T18:14:20 <Justin_o> jhung, heidiv: that sort of makes sense, because the panel determines it's height on open
2013-08-27T18:14:51 <heidiv> Justin_o yeah
2013-08-27T18:15:11 <avtar> jhung: i have a windows 7 vm now so i don't need to take up your time
2013-08-27T18:15:12 <Justin_o> jhung, heidiv: if it's not easily fixed we could just file a new jira for it, if it is sized correctly on first load of a narrow screen that might be good enough for most cases
2013-08-27T18:15:55 <jhung> avtar:  ok cool. Let me know if I can help though.
2013-08-27T18:16:14 <avtar> jhung: thanks
2013-08-27T18:16:17 <heidiv> Justin_o and i'm still unable to recreate on my end. jhung's going to try a fix for me. i think IE is not acknowledging the overflow:none on iframe's html tag
2013-08-27T18:16:24 <avtar> you could also review this important document http://i.imgur.com/FRD7RCC.jpg

2013-08-27T18:16:53 <yzen> kasparnet:
2013-08-27T18:17:30 <jhung> avtar: kids and their fancy cloud computers.
2013-08-27T18:17:31 <kasparnet> So there is some crazy weirdness in the integration testing framework
2013-08-27T18:17:49 <kasparnet> yzen: adding three tests causes everything to explode
2013-08-27T18:18:15 <kasparnet> ... and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with what tests have been run
2013-08-27T18:18:31 <kasparnet> the error is nested somewhere in the IoC framework
2013-08-27T18:18:51 <kasparnet> (or.. not really sure.. that's just where it's thrown)
2013-08-27T18:18:58 <yzen> kasparnet: do you have this stuff committed anywhere?
2013-08-27T18:19:09 <kasparnet> yes, all over the place actually :S
2013-08-27T18:19:31 <kasparnet> yzen: Javi's linux branch: https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/tree/GPII-20
2013-08-27T18:19:47 <kasparnet> and universal branch: https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/tree/GPII-89_GPII-72_GPII-20
2013-08-27T18:20:14 <yzen> kasparnet: and i should run it in linux i assume
2013-08-27T18:20:15 <kasparnet> And you need to do this hack: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/infusion/compare/GPII-177
2013-08-27T18:20:19 <kasparnet> yzen:
2013-08-27T18:20:21 <kasparnet> yes*
2013-08-27T18:20:44 <yzen> that looks crazy
2013-08-27T18:20:45 <yzen> :)
2013-08-27T18:23:33 <kasparnet> what part of it?
2013-08-27T18:26:04 <jhung> heidiv, Justin_o: it looks okay in IE10. It looks a bit strange with 2 horizontal scrollbars (one for the browser and one for the DT panel), but there are no vertical scrollbars.
2013-08-27T18:26:48 <heidiv> jhung that second bar will be fixed with 176 i think - did you take a look at that one?
2013-08-27T18:27:13 <heidiv> Justin_o if the issue is a vert scroll just in IE9, perhaps 171 can go in and i'll file another jira for that?
2013-08-27T18:27:43 <Justin_o> jhung, heidiv: strange, i've seen it in both IE 10 and IE 9
2013-08-27T18:28:57 <yzen> the hack :) but anyways , let me take a look
2013-08-27T18:29:34 <jhung> heidiv: makes sense. I haven't looked at 176 yet.

2013-08-27T19:09:12 <Justin_o> heidiv: thanks
2013-08-27T19:11:45 <cindyli> Justin_o: i issued another pull request (https://github.com/fluid-project/prefsEditors/pull/36) for GPII-169, to fix the ie8 issue that self voicing enactor throws js error. can you review it when you have a chance?
2013-08-27T19:12:37 <yzen> so kasparnet
2013-08-27T19:12:47 <yzen> i tried with the branches you said, which particular user fails ?
2013-08-27T19:12:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: will do
2013-08-27T19:13:04 <cindyli> thanks
2013-08-27T19:19:41 <Justin_o> heidiv: I'm still getting the overlap issue with safari for the focus styling of the presets when the contrasts are set
2013-08-27T19:21:54 <heidiv> Justin_o ughhh ok haha\xe2\x80\xa6 one sec
2013-08-27T19:29:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: merged in GPII-169
2013-08-27T19:29:36 <cindyli> nice. thanks. Justin_o
2013-08-27T19:33:38 <kasparnet> yzen: sorry, not seeing this till now
2013-08-27T19:33:47 <yzen> kasparnet: np
2013-08-27T19:33:49 <kasparnet> ... none of the users fail, but the integration testing does
2013-08-27T19:33:54 <yzen> oh duh
2013-08-27T19:33:56 <yzen> one sec
2013-08-27T19:34:07 <kasparnet> so in linux dir do: node tests/integrationTesting.js
2013-08-27T19:34:12 <kasparnet> and watch it explode
2013-08-27T19:34:58 <yzen> so you have 12/18 passing ?
2013-08-27T19:40:56 <jhernandez> yzen: comment one integration test from integrationTesting.js
2013-08-27T19:41:03 <jhernandez> and watch it working
2013-08-27T19:41:04 <jhernandez> :P
2013-08-27T19:41:19 <yzen> one sec
2013-08-27T19:41:32 <jhernandez> at least, this is what happens to me
2013-08-27T19:42:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: Merged in FLUID-5116 into DT
2013-08-27T19:43:13 <cindyli> yay! thanks, Justin_o

2013-08-27T20:22:20 <yzen> kasparnet, jhernandez hard to tell what the issue is but i think i saw this problem in my kettle tests. i would suggest just as an experiment to create a separate test case holder for each testDef and see if it works
2013-08-27T20:23:59 <kasparnet> yzen: ok.. It just seems weird that it runs two tests, but not three
2013-08-27T20:24:10 <yzen> perhaps Bosmon might have an idea
2013-08-27T20:24:23 <kasparnet> I'm sure bosmon would disagree that 2 is significantly different from 3..*

2013-08-27T15:31:45 <Justin_o> can you take a look at that
2013-08-27T15:31:48 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2013-08-27T15:31:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2013-08-27T15:34:06 <cindyli> Justin_o: conflict resolved and pushed up
2013-08-27T15:47:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. i'll take another look
2013-08-27T15:47:58 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2013-08-27T16:01:16 <jhernandez> kasparnet: just pushed a new branch javihernandez/GPII-20
2013-08-27T16:02:23 <jhernandez> it's tracking kaspermarkus/GPII-20
2013-08-27T16:02:33 <kasparnet> are we in linux or universal?
2013-08-27T16:02:42 <jhernandez> linux
2013-08-27T16:02:51 <heidiv> Justin_o could you take a look at 171 again when you have time?
2013-08-27T16:03:28 <jhernandez> now, I'll do the same with GPII-20, but for universal
2013-08-27T16:03:37 <Justin_o> heidiv: will do
2013-08-27T16:04:51 <Justin_o> jhung, cindyli: GPII-165/GPII-157 merged
2013-08-27T16:05:05 <cindyli> great. thanks, Justin_o

2013-08-27T16:07:26 <jhung> great Justin_o
2013-08-27T16:13:14 <kasparnet> Jhernandez: did you want me to try and pull it down and test? Or should I wait up?
2013-08-27T16:15:54 <Justin_o> heidiv: still getting the vertical scroll bars in IE 10 and IE 9 for GPII-171
2013-08-27T16:16:59 <heidiv> Justin_o hm, my IE9 is fine
2013-08-27T16:17:02 <heidiv> did you clear cache?
2013-08-27T16:17:16 <Justin_o> heidiv: i'll clean it out and try again
2013-08-27T16:19:14 <Justin_o> heidiv: still there.. so to be clear i see it when i open the discovery panel and shrink the width so that the horizontal scroll bar appears
2013-08-27T16:19:32 <heidiv> Justin_o wish i could recreate - which win OS?
2013-08-27T16:20:03 <heidiv> i'll get jhung to take a look too
2013-08-27T16:20:20 <Justin_o> heidiv: win7
2013-08-27T16:20:31 <Justin_o> heidiv: good idea to have jhung take a look too
2013-08-27T16:21:55 <jhernandez> kasparnet: just made a pull request to your GPII-20
2013-08-27T16:22:58 * michelled joined the channel
2013-08-27T16:25:31 <heidiv> Justin_o yeah my win7/IE9 doesn't have vert bars. hmph
2013-08-27T16:27:47 <kasparnet> jhernandez: perhaps to avoid total confusion, it might be easiest if I leave my linux GPII-20 branch be (or delete it), and we consider your branch the latest and greatest?
2013-08-27T16:28:01 <Justin_o> heidiv: really.. okay.. i guess that will make jhung the tie breaker :)
2013-08-27T16:28:08 <heidiv> hehe
2013-08-27T16:28:12 <Justin_o> heidiv: are you sure you committed and pushed up all your changes?
2013-08-27T16:28:35 <heidiv> Justin_o yeah
2013-08-27T16:28:36 <kasparnet> jhernandez: but we keep GPII-20 on my account as the one to do GPII pull requests from?
2013-08-27T16:28:56 <Justin_o> heidiv: okay.. then we'll leave it to jhung to look at :)
2013-08-27T16:29:01 <heidiv> haha ok
2013-08-27T16:29:02 <kasparnet> jhernandez: should I test your linux version, or do you want to push something to your universal/GPII-20 first?
2013-08-27T16:29:33 <jhernandez> kasparnet: wait for my universal branch of all
2013-08-27T16:29:34 <jhernandez> almost there

2013-08-27T16:41:42 <Justin_o> heidiv: by the way, was going to look at your pull request for GPII-162, looks like it has merge conflicts with master right now
2013-08-27T16:49:44 <avtar> Bosmon, heidiv, jhung, kasparnet: are any of you using windows 7 and/or 8?
2013-08-27T16:51:56 <jhung> avtar: I have Win7 and Win8
2013-08-27T16:52:20 <jhung> Justin_o: I'll take a look at GPII-171 now to see how it looks.
2013-08-27T16:54:52 <avtar> jhung: what's your schedule like today? i was hoping to get some help with testing the openvpn windows client
2013-08-27T16:55:34 <jhung> avtar: maybe around 2:30p?

2013-08-27T16:58:31 <jhernandez> should work with https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/tree/GPII-20
2013-08-27T17:00:12 <jhernandez> take into account that you need to include the changes on https://github.com/kaspermarkus/infusion/compare/GPII-177
2013-08-27T17:01:55 <jhung> heidiv, Justin_o: On IE9 when I resize the window, both horizontal and vertical bars appear.
2013-08-27T17:05:40 <jhernandez> kasparnet: aaand, the integration testing would not work because of the more-than-2-tests weird thing

2013-08-27T17:10:06 <kasparnet> yzen: Is there some central place where I can put a breakpoint that'll catch all the errors thrown during the various promises, etc in the system
2013-08-27T17:10:46 <kasparnet> yzen: it's driving me f!@#ing crazy to have to step through everything every time something silently goes wrong
