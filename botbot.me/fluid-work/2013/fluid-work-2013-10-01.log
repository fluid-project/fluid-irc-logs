b'2013-10-01T18:24:54 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-01T18:24:55 <jhernandez> no prob
2013-10-01T18:25:01 * yzen has quit
2013-10-01T18:25:02 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2013-10-01T18:25:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thank you
2013-10-01T18:25:59 <clown> jhernandez:  your add-on returns:
2013-10-01T18:26:00 <clown> [ { id: \'tuxguitar;1.2-12.fc19;x86_64;fedora\',
2013-10-01T18:26:01 <clown> name: \'tuxguitar\',
2013-10-01T18:26:01 <clown> version: \'1.2-12.fc19\',
2013-10-01T18:26:01 <clown> data: \'fedora\' } ]
2013-10-01T18:26:06 <jhernandez> so, next step: to check both \'install\' and \'remove\' methods and using the tuxguitar package (sounds funny)
2013-10-01T18:26:35 * jhernandez looks for the output here ..
2013-10-01T18:26:54 <clown> okay.
2013-10-01T18:27:38 <jhernandez> {
2013-10-01T18:27:38 <jhernandez> "id": "tuxguitar;1.2-10.1.1;i586;repo-12.3-oss",
2013-10-01T18:27:38 <jhernandez> "name": "tuxguitar",

2013-10-01T18:27:40 <jhernandez> }
2013-10-01T18:27:51 <jhernandez> sweet!
2013-10-01T18:30:19 <jhernandez> clown: do you want me to go for it? or you want to?
2013-10-01T18:32:25 <anastasiac> Justin_o and cindyli, I\'m working on docs for the prefs framework Builder. I notice that it "is an" aux builder, but "has a" primary builder. Is there a particular reason why the two were implemented differently? e.g. why is the aux builder not a subcomponent, or why is the primary builder not a grade?
2013-10-01T18:32:25 <clown> Let me, jhernandez.
2013-10-01T18:33:16 * michelled has quit
2013-10-01T18:33:26 <jhernandez> clown: thank you!
2013-10-01T18:33:42 <clown> what I would do for the test is:  1.  search(\'tuxguitar\'), 2. check the return value, 3.  run install, 4. search and see that the \'data\' field shows that it\'s installed, 5. run remove, 6. search and see that the data field now says available.
2013-10-01T18:33:45 <clown> how does that sound?
2013-10-01T18:34:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - won\'t it be great when renderer component trees are abolished :)
2013-10-01T18:34:06 <jhernandez> clown: sounds great
2013-10-01T18:34:24 <jhernandez> :]
2013-10-01T18:34:25 <clown> jhernandez:  is there anything like "assert()" for testing in this case?
2013-10-01T18:34:41 <jhernandez> yup
2013-10-01T18:34:45 <clown> maybe I should look at other test examples.
2013-10-01T18:34:46 * jhernandez looks
2013-10-01T18:35:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. it will be :)
2013-10-01T18:36:40 <jhernandez> clown: in GPII, we use tests like this one -> https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/blob/packagekitBridge/node_modules/gsettingsBridge/tests/gsettingsTests.js
2013-10-01T18:36:55 <clown> jhernandez:   thanks, one other question...
2013-10-01T18:37:33 <jhernandez> another example: https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/blob/packagekitBridge/node_modules/orca/test/orcaSettingsHandlerTests.js
2013-10-01T18:37:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m trying to remember, perhaps cindyli will recall, but i believe that the primaryBuilder is a subcomponent because of some issues with grade merging
2013-10-01T18:37:56 <clown> when tuxguitar is installed on fedora, the data property is "installed:fedora".  Is it "installed:opensuse" for you?
2013-10-01T18:38:03 <jhernandez> but take into account that we\'re testing specific GPII functionalities and the payloads around
2013-10-01T18:38:15 <jhernandez> let me check
2013-10-01T18:38:16 <clown> that is, is it always "installed:<something>"
2013-10-01T18:38:19 <clown> ?
2013-10-01T18:39:24 <clown> also:  time lines:  I\'m chairing a teleconfernce in half an hour, for an hour.  I won\'t really start this until later today, early tomorrow.  Is that okay?
2013-10-01T18:40:31 <jhernandez> okay
2013-10-01T18:40:32 <jhernandez> np
2013-10-01T18:40:36 <jhernandez> and ...
2013-10-01T18:40:48 <jhernandez> yes, I think that "installed" is something generic
2013-10-01T18:40:57 * yzen_ joined the channel
2013-10-01T18:41:13 <jhernandez> still installing tuxguitar ...
2013-10-01T18:41:20 <clown> cool.  I was looking for something to compare against that would appear on all platforms.
2013-10-01T18:41:40 <jhernandez> (or maybe just stalled?)
2013-10-01T18:41:45 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, unfortunately, i don\'t rmb too :(
2013-10-01T18:41:49 <clown> yes, it took me about 2 minutes to install tuxgutiar here.  This will require a "timeout" between installing and removing.
2013-10-01T18:42:10 <anastasiac> ok, Justin_o and cindyli, thanks for trying to remember :-)
2013-10-01T18:42:19 <Justin_o> sorry
2013-10-01T18:42:25 <jhernandez> defintely we need a status callback function and log what is coming from packagekit
2013-10-01T18:42:47 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-01T18:42:50 <jhernandez> clown:
2013-10-01T18:42:54 <jhernandez> before
2013-10-01T18:42:55 <clown> yes?
2013-10-01T18:42:59 <jhernandez> {

2013-10-01T18:43:46 <jhernandez> you can just look for the word \'installed\' on data
2013-10-01T18:44:01 <clown> right.  That\'s what I was hoping, jhernandez.
2013-10-01T18:44:14 <jhernandez> nice!
2013-10-01T18:44:20 <clown> Ok.  I have to run now and get things set up for my telecon, jhernandez.
2013-10-01T18:44:28 <jhernandez> go for it
2013-10-01T18:44:29 <clown> Talk to you later, and thanks for all the help.
2013-10-01T18:44:32 <jhernandez> and thank you!
2013-10-01T18:44:39 <clown> my pleasure.

2013-10-01T18:58:29 <Bosmon> Do you still want us to talk about it at tomorrow\'s COMUNITY METING?
2013-10-01T18:58:40 <Bosmon> I guess I know enough about it to describe how it will work ....
2013-10-01T18:58:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think that was for next weeks anyways.. so you still have time
2013-10-01T18:59:02 <Bosmon> Really? I thought we had said Oct 2
2013-10-01T18:59:05 <Bosmon> What is tomorrow\'s about?

2013-10-01T18:59:40 <Bosmon> No, next week works fine
2013-10-01T18:59:41 <Justin_o> or anastasiac might want to do more documentation
2013-10-01T18:59:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. cool
2013-10-01T19:08:16 * thealphanerd has quit
2013-10-01T19:10:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon, anastasiac: do we have any docs with the fully hydrated component trees still
2013-10-01T19:11:10 <anastasiac> hm...
2013-10-01T19:11:14 * anastasiac searches
2013-10-01T19:11:45 <anastasiac> we have this page, Justin_o: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/ProtoComponent+Types
2013-10-01T19:11:51 <anastasiac> is that what you\'re looking for?
2013-10-01T19:12:54 <Justin_o> anastasiac: not really sorry.. i want the old style.. before protocomponents
2013-10-01T19:13:02 <anastasiac> ah
2013-10-01T19:13:03 <anastasiac> hm
2013-10-01T19:13:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you know in the old style are children the only point of nesting where the nested object would have an ID and valuebinding
2013-10-01T19:13:54 <anastasiac> how about this, Justin_o?  http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion13/Renderer+Component+Trees
2013-10-01T19:14:18 <Bosmon> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion13/Fluid+Renderer+-+Background
2013-10-01T19:14:23 <Bosmon> This page also describes them
2013-10-01T19:14:30 <Bosmon> yes, "children" is the only route for nesting components
2013-10-01T19:20:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2013-10-01T19:20:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: in IoC testing system, can I pass an argument list to an event listener? for example,
2013-10-01T19:20:42 <cindyli> sequence: [{
2013-10-01T19:20:42 <cindyli> listener: "fluid.tests.checkTopComponents",
2013-10-01T19:20:42 <cindyli> event: "{fluid.tests.videoPlayerMediaPanels}.events.onReady"
2013-10-01T19:20:42 <cindyli> }]
2013-10-01T19:21:01 * michelled joined the channel
2013-10-01T19:21:24 <cindyli> i tried to pass an "args" option but doesn\'t work
2013-10-01T19:22:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - "doesn\'t work" is the classic terrible problem report :)
2013-10-01T19:22:20 <cindyli> haha
2013-10-01T19:22:25 <Bosmon> You can see some examples of "args" in the "TestingTest.js" test cases
2013-10-01T19:22:35 <Bosmon> What kind of "doesn\'t work" did you experience?
2013-10-01T19:23:04 <Bosmon> I guess there isn\'t an example of "args" with "listener" ....
2013-10-01T19:23:10 <cindyli> i did, the test cases with "args" are all for modelChanged type of listener, not any for event listeners

b'2013-10-01T17:38:05 <clown> actually, shouldn\'t the test compare an expected result with an actual result?
2013-10-01T17:38:19 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-10-01T17:38:39 <clown> for example, you pass a package name to the search fucntion and compare what you get with what you should get?
2013-10-01T17:39:19 <clown> and that\'s why you are looking for a shared name that works for both suse and fedora.
2013-10-01T17:39:27 * clown is slow.
2013-10-01T17:39:39 <clown> dbus?
2013-10-01T17:39:50 * clown looks at what packages dbus will give you.
2013-10-01T17:41:20 <jhernandez> heh, I was looking for a tiny utility such as \'tac\'
2013-10-01T17:41:21 <clown> jhernandez:  yum info dbus ==>  \'dbus;1.6.12;x86_64;installed,fedora\'.
2013-10-01T17:41:52 <clown> although, I\'m not sure about the \'installed,fedora\' part.  Yum\'s output is not the same as pkit.
2013-10-01T17:41:58 <jhernandez> clown: what we want is a package for installing, check the new id, uninstall it, and then check the new id again
2013-10-01T17:42:29 <clown> jhernandez:  I did that yesterday \xe2\x80\x94 specifically looking for a package that had no dependencies (self-contained).  Let me go find it again.
2013-10-01T17:42:58 <clown> jhernandez:  \'dtach\'
2013-10-01T17:43:02 <jhernandez> clown: nice! I\'m partially giving some support to the android guys
2013-10-01T17:43:09 * jhernandez looks in his openSUSE
2013-10-01T17:43:20 * clown has no idea what dtach is for...
2013-10-01T17:44:08 <jhernandez> No packages found. :(
2013-10-01T17:44:18 <clown> shoot!
2013-10-01T17:44:57 <clown> emacs?
2013-10-01T17:46:03 <clown> no, not emacs.  Matches \'xemacs\' as well.  And a bunch of other stuff.
2013-10-01T17:46:10 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2013-10-01T17:46:17 * clown checks \'tac\'
2013-10-01T17:46:28 <jhernandez> tac is not available for openSUSE :(
2013-10-01T17:47:37 <clown> oh, never mind then.  But packagekit.searchPackages(\'tac\'), gave me a whole bunch of stuff, including some youtube packages.
2013-10-01T17:48:09 <jhernandez> yup, but we can just filter out them from the .js side
2013-10-01T17:48:29 <jhernandez> a bunch of results won\'t be a problem
2013-10-01T17:48:33 * avtar joined the channel
2013-10-01T17:48:50 <clown> btw, I also tried passing no argument to searchpackage and got "[]" returned.  Strikes me as another test case that worked.
2013-10-01T17:48:51 <jhernandez> what about pico?
2013-10-01T17:48:57 * clown looks at pico.
2013-10-01T17:49:28 <jhernandez> it\'s not installed by default (at least for openSUSE)
2013-10-01T17:49:28 <clown> pico returns six packages.
2013-10-01T17:50:00 <clown> two of the six are devel packages \xe2\x80\x94 want to change the filter now to avoid those?
2013-10-01T17:50:08 <clown> in the c++ code?
2013-10-01T17:50:32 <clown> or pass that as an argument to searchPackages()?
2013-10-01T17:51:21 <jhernandez> I was thinking about filtering the devel packages out by default
2013-10-01T17:51:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yzen and I are trying to use the model tranformations for the produceTree rebasing. We are running into an issue with children
2013-10-01T17:52:01 <Justin_o> well recursion in general
2013-10-01T17:52:27 <jhernandez> by adding the NOT_DEVELOPMENT enum
2013-10-01T17:52:37 <clown> so, jhernandez, just put PK_FILTER_ENUM_NOT_DEVELOPMENT right in the C++?  Fine with me.
2013-10-01T17:53:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - didn\'t we decide yesterday not to use that approach?
2013-10-01T17:53:06 <jhernandez> and when installing (from js side), just pick the exact name (in this case: pico)
2013-10-01T17:53:10 <Bosmon> Can you describe in detail what you\'re doing?
2013-10-01T17:53:27 <Justin_o> well it\'s not the prototree anymore :)
2013-10-01T17:53:42 <Justin_o> basically we are using the model transformation to change ID and valuebinding
2013-10-01T17:53:51 <clown> jhernandez:  well, are taking "testing" or "using"?
2013-10-01T17:54:14 <clown> from a test point of view, with limited filtering, one expects a lot of packages to come out, no?
2013-10-01T17:54:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sounds dangerous : P
2013-10-01T17:54:25 <clown> Unless the package is self-contained.
2013-10-01T17:54:48 <jhernandez> clown: yup (and both for using)
2013-10-01T17:55:00 <jhernandez> getting a lot of results is not a problem
2013-10-01T17:55:03 <clown> whoops, I meant "are we *talking* \'testing\' or \'using\'?
2013-10-01T17:55:28 <Justin_o> other than the recursive part, it seems to have simplified the changes
2013-10-01T17:56:21 <jhernandez> a "if (pkg.name === "pico")" clause will get the specific package we want
2013-10-01T17:56:55 <jhernandez> so, does pico pull from additional dependencies on fedora?
2013-10-01T17:57:08 <Bosmon> What do you mean by "the recursive part"?
2013-10-01T17:58:15 <Justin_o> well the tree\'s can have multiple levels.. so we need to be able to change the ID and valuebinding at each level
2013-10-01T17:58:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I see
2013-10-01T17:58:53 <Bosmon> I really wouldn\'t try using model transformations for this
2013-10-01T17:58:58 <clown> jherenandez, re:  "does pico pull from additional dependencies on fedora?"  yes \xe2\x80\x94 let me do a pastebin.
2013-10-01T17:59:03 <Bosmon> You are, as an old employer would put it, "making a rod for your own back"

2013-10-01T18:01:06 <jhernandez> ooops
2013-10-01T18:01:17 <jhernandez> I see
2013-10-01T18:01:25 <jhernandez> \'pico\' is a text editor
2013-10-01T18:01:56 <jhernandez> seems that is not available for fedora \xc2\xac\xc2\xac
2013-10-01T18:01:58 <jhernandez> grr
2013-10-01T18:02:21 <clown> oh, right, there is no "pico" in there...
2013-10-01T18:04:02 <clown> what about "orca"?
2013-10-01T18:04:05 <jhernandez> I\'m looking for a tiny app, no deps
2013-10-01T18:04:09 <jhernandez> is already installed
2013-10-01T18:04:37 <clown> oh, you don\'t want to remove it.
2013-10-01T18:04:40 <clown> gedit?
2013-10-01T18:04:53 <jhernandez> the same with orca
2013-10-01T18:04:56 <Justin_o> so Bosmon (it\'s me yzen), as a concrete example in case we have a nested array/object structure with a certain key of interest repeating on different levels, is there a way to express that interest in the transformation rules
2013-10-01T18:05:00 <clown> no, not gedit.  Way too many dependencies.
2013-10-01T18:05:03 <jhernandez> gedit cames with gnome
2013-10-01T18:05:07 <jhernandez> *comes
2013-10-01T18:05:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not a way that works very well, no
2013-10-01T18:05:23 <Bosmon> You may consider that wildcard support is "not really working" in MT now
2013-10-01T18:05:33 <Bosmon> And so for this, as well as other reasons, I suggest that you use code : P
2013-10-01T18:05:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but how would it looks
2013-10-01T18:05:45 <clown> I might have one, jhernandez:  \'accerciser\'.  :-)
2013-10-01T18:05:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: out of curioucity
2013-10-01T18:05:49 <Bosmon> We have support for matching path segments as "*"
2013-10-01T18:06:02 <jhernandez> clown: heh, yes!
2013-10-01T18:06:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but do we need to know the depth for that ?
2013-10-01T18:06:07 <clown> [ { id: \'accerciser;3.8.2-1.fc19;noarch;fedora\',
2013-10-01T18:06:07 <clown> name: \'accerciser\',
2013-10-01T18:06:07 <clown> version: \'3.8.2-1.fc19\',
2013-10-01T18:06:07 <clown> data: \'fedora\' } ]
2013-10-01T18:06:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, you need to know the depth
2013-10-01T18:06:23 <clown> of course I have it installed...
2013-10-01T18:06:27 <Bosmon> So in general there is no facility for "recursive pattern matching"
2013-10-01T18:06:29 <jhernandez> it\'ll pull from some deps, but it\'s not a problem
2013-10-01T18:06:37 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-01T18:06:39 <Bosmon> And I am not in a hurry to implement any : P
2013-10-01T18:06:46 <clown> does it pull in python?
2013-10-01T18:06:51 <jhernandez> ipython
2013-10-01T18:06:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2013-10-01T18:06:59 <jhernandez> and ipython pulls qt-stuff
2013-10-01T18:07:16 <jhernandez> :(
2013-10-01T18:07:24 <clown> ah, yes.  That never gets pulled in for me.  I *always* get the "missing iptyhon* error message on launch.
2013-10-01T18:07:37 <clown> or ipython even
2013-10-01T18:09:56 <jhernandez> really? installing from repos?
2013-10-01T18:10:12 <jhernandez> AFAIK, accerciser pulls ipython
2013-10-01T18:10:33 <jhernandez> under both Fedora and openSUSE
2013-10-01T18:10:51 <jhernandez> clown: search for \'retext\'
2013-10-01T18:11:10 <clown> actually, no.  I get the source for git.gnome, and then build it myself.  I have a custom viewer for the "Interface Viewer" tab
2013-10-01T18:11:28 <clown> *I get the source for accerciser from git.gnome
2013-10-01T18:11:31 <jhernandez> it pulls from some python deps, but not too many (2 or 3)
2013-10-01T18:11:43 * clown searching for retext
2013-10-01T18:11:55 <jhernandez> clown: ok, so if you install it from the repos it\'ll pulls ipython and co
2013-10-01T18:14:42 <clown> jhernandez:  *sigh*.  there is no \'retext\' for fedora.
2013-10-01T18:14:48 <jhernandez> crap!!
2013-10-01T18:15:52 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-01T18:16:13 <jhernandez> \x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7fwhat about sl
2013-10-01T18:16:23 <jhernandez> ?
2013-10-01T18:16:59 <colinclark> how\'s your dog, jhernandez?
2013-10-01T18:17:17 <jhernandez> can\'t believe my eyes, sl not available for openSUSE!
2013-10-01T18:17:28 <jhernandez> colinclark: she\'s well
2013-10-01T18:17:41 <colinclark> good!
2013-10-01T18:17:42 <jhernandez> she brought 8 puppies!
2013-10-01T18:17:45 <colinclark> wow
2013-10-01T18:17:48 <colinclark> congratulations!
2013-10-01T18:17:54 <jhernandez> :S
2013-10-01T18:17:57 <colinclark> avtar, puppies! ^
2013-10-01T18:18:02 <jhernandez> too many puppies!
2013-10-01T18:18:58 <jhernandez> https://www.facebook.com/javiube/posts/10200770127357397
2013-10-01T18:19:07 <clown> jhernandez:  how about \'goudy\'?
2013-10-01T18:19:17 <jhernandez> avtar: puppies! I\'ll send them to you wherever you are! :P
2013-10-01T18:19:30 * jhernandez looks for goudy
2013-10-01T18:19:40 * clown wonders if jhernandez is handing out cigars.
2013-10-01T18:20:04 <avtar> jhernandez: toronto. but please also send someone who can tend to them
2013-10-01T18:20:22 <avtar> i\'ll tackle the playing-with-them task
2013-10-01T18:20:44 <jhernandez> clown: xDDD
2013-10-01T18:20:53 <jhernandez> avtar: xDD
2013-10-01T18:21:28 <jhernandez> clown: not goudy
2013-10-01T18:21:36 <jhernandez> what about tuxguitar? ;)
2013-10-01T18:21:37 <clown> phooey.
2013-10-01T18:21:50 <clown> I\'ll try anything, jhernandez
2013-10-01T18:21:55 <jhernandez> xDDD
2013-10-01T18:22:57 <clown> jhernandez:  we have a winner (?)  Both yum and searchPackages return only the one package.
2013-10-01T18:23:12 <anastasiac> Justin_o, michelled, I\'ve created a JIRA for the task of moving and re-namespacing the prefs framework: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5161
2013-10-01T18:23:14 <jhernandez> I\'m looking for its deps
2013-10-01T18:23:25 <anastasiac> it makes me wonder if we\'ll want to create a JIRA component for the prefs framework
2013-10-01T18:23:49 <jhernandez> just 8 deps here
2013-10-01T18:24:30 <clown> jhernandez:  according to the pkit GUI, it has no dependencies.
2013-10-01T18:24:47 <clown> I clicked the "Dependent packages" button, and nothing came up.

2013-10-01T16:59:28 <clown> jhernandez:  pong
2013-10-01T17:00:19 <jhernandez> after trying the module ...
2013-10-01T17:00:34 <jhernandez> do you think it fits our needs?
2013-10-01T17:00:47 <jhernandez> are you missing something?
2013-10-01T17:00:53 <jhernandez> do you have any ideas?
2013-10-01T17:01:49 <jhernandez> right now I have a branch in Android where I am going to do the same, but for Android
2013-10-01T17:01:58 <clown> "do you think it fits our needs?"  yes, but I\'m trying to think of things we might want to do in addition to this basic functionality.
2013-10-01T17:02:31 <clown> "are you missing something"?  I don\'t think so.  I see how it works.  I\'ve been looking at the pkit glib documentation to see how it might be extended.
2013-10-01T17:03:17 <clown> "do you have any ideas?"  Yes, I wrote an email about using filters to finesse the search.  I\'m looking into how to use them here.
2013-10-01T17:03:32 <clown> It will mean changes to your code, but I\'m not sure how yet.
2013-10-01T17:03:49 <clown> oh, and btw.
2013-10-01T17:04:08 <clown> again with the synchronous calls.  Can we get away with that?
2013-10-01T17:05:07 <clown> another btw:  thanks for solving this problem.
2013-10-01T17:05:12 <clown> with your code, jhernandez.
2013-10-01T17:05:23 <jhernandez> we can change it to be async easily
2013-10-01T17:05:41 <jhernandez> heh, clown yw, I love writing c++ :]
2013-10-01T17:05:54 <clown> you do?  why???  ;-)
2013-10-01T17:06:00 <jhernandez> dunno
2013-10-01T17:06:10 <jhernandez> don\'t ask :P
2013-10-01T17:06:29 <jhernandez> ok
2013-10-01T17:06:30 <jhernandez> so
2013-10-01T17:06:32 <clown> actually, you have written this strange mixture of C++ and GOBject.
2013-10-01T17:06:39 <jhernandez> heh
2013-10-01T17:06:46 <clown> (not that you had a choice..._
2013-10-01T17:06:50 <jhernandez> yes, it\'s strange
2013-10-01T17:07:33 <jhernandez> but GObject simplifies a lot of stuff
2013-10-01T17:07:41 <clown> shall I try to change it to async?  Just to get some experience with this stuff?
2013-10-01T17:07:44 <jhernandez> and C++/v8 stuff too
2013-10-01T17:08:04 <jhernandez> I\'m ok with it
2013-10-01T17:08:40 <jhernandez> anyway, I\'d like to keep working on the "cross-platform" solution
2013-10-01T17:08:53 <clown> makes sense.
2013-10-01T17:09:29 <jhernandez> so I\'d re-read our thoughts about device reporting stuff, and will compose a mail
2013-10-01T17:09:48 <jhernandez> I\'d like to hear from Steve and others
2013-10-01T17:10:16 <clown> by "re-read out thoughts", do you mean this:  http://piratepad.net/aIQKUWQFJJ
2013-10-01T17:10:18 <clown> ?
2013-10-01T17:10:21 <jhernandez> others == yzen colin kasper Bosmon ...
2013-10-01T17:10:33 <clown> "everyone" in other words...
2013-10-01T17:10:36 <clown> :-)
2013-10-01T17:10:37 <jhernandez> clown: basically, yes (that piratepad) plus some mails
2013-10-01T17:10:41 * jhernandez nods
2013-10-01T17:11:53 * clown notes that the filtering stuff I posted to the architecture mailing list is do-able using jhernandez\'s pkit node add-on.
2013-10-01T17:12:21 <clown> the filters are given in the pkit glib interface.  Alas, they are enums there...
2013-10-01T17:12:53 * jhernandez nods
2013-10-01T17:13:15 <jhernandez> in fact, you can see there that I am looking for INSTALLED and AVAILABLE packages
2013-10-01T17:14:03 <jhernandez> but we can change the add-on to be filter-dynamic
2013-10-01T17:14:23 <clown> btw, looking that pirate pad, line 44, where it declares "OS"?  If I do packagekit.searchPackage("OS"), I get every possible package output.  Every one of them.
2013-10-01T17:14:36 <jhernandez> well
2013-10-01T17:14:56 <jhernandez> OS comes from node.js
2013-10-01T17:15:06 <clown> regarding "filter-dynamic":  right, that\'s what i was thinking.  The javascript could call the search function with filters.
2013-10-01T17:15:35 <jhernandez> not from the device reporter, but this object can be extended
2013-10-01T17:15:57 <clown> what do you mean "from the device reporter"?
2013-10-01T17:16:31 <jhernandez> you can get the OS details directly from node.js
2013-10-01T17:17:05 <jhernandez> var os = require(\'os\');
2013-10-01T17:17:21 <jhernandez> os.platform()
2013-10-01T17:17:23 <jhernandez> \'linux\'
2013-10-01T17:17:36 <clown> oh, I see.  So, there is no need to even use pkit in this case (If you want the os you are running on).
2013-10-01T17:17:37 <jhernandez> os.release()
2013-10-01T17:17:37 <jhernandez> \'3.7.10-1.1-default\'
2013-10-01T17:17:44 <jhernandez> yup
2013-10-01T17:17:49 <clown> gotcha.
2013-10-01T17:18:02 <jhernandez> our add-on is just to deal with packages
2013-10-01T17:18:18 <clown> but, am I crazy to suggest using filters to narrow the serach for software packages?
2013-10-01T17:18:24 <jhernandez> aka: what we called "DR Plugin"
2013-10-01T17:18:27 <clown> or just loony?
2013-10-01T17:19:40 <jhernandez> not loony
2013-10-01T17:20:29 <jhernandez> ie: if we run this module into a pure-free distribution, we would like to use the FREE filter
2013-10-01T17:21:24 <jhernandez> so it\'s not a crazy idea at all
2013-10-01T17:22:47 <clown> yes, that\'s one application.
2013-10-01T17:23:12 * avtar has quit
2013-10-01T17:23:12 <clown> another is:  "don\'t give me any "devel" packages".  I assume that most GPII users just want the apps.
2013-10-01T17:23:26 * jhernandez nods
2013-10-01T17:23:59 <clown> so:  PK_FILTER_ENUM_NOT_DEVELOPMENT
2013-10-01T17:24:11 <jhernandez> yup
2013-10-01T17:24:29 <jhernandez> in fact, *I think* that this should be mandatory
2013-10-01T17:25:11 <jhernandez> now, it could be a good idea if we provide some tests
2013-10-01T17:25:35 <jhernandez> at this moment we\'re only testing the "searchPackage" functionality
2013-10-01T17:25:58 * clown looks
2013-10-01T17:26:55 * jhernandez looks for a shared-name (and not usually installed by users) package both for suse and fedora
2013-10-01T17:29:33 * clown talking with wife...
2013-10-01T17:36:35 <clown> jhernandez:  my attention is back here now.  You were saying that "we\'re only testing the searchPackage" functionality.
