2013-12-30T18:02:48 <colinclark> Hey jhernandez or sgithens, are either of you around?
2013-12-30T18:04:56 <sgithens> colinclark : Word
2013-12-30T18:05:01 <colinclark> hey
2013-12-30T18:05:16 <colinclark> how was your Christmas?
2013-12-30T18:05:16 <sgithens> what's the haps
2013-12-30T18:05:19 <sgithens> good
2013-12-30T18:05:27 <sgithens> I got this sweet Kinto pour over
2013-12-30T18:05:31 <sgithens> and some scarves
2013-12-30T18:05:34 <colinclark> oh nice
2013-12-30T18:06:21 <sgithens> you?
2013-12-30T18:06:30 <colinclark> Yeah, it was really good
2013-12-30T18:06:38 <colinclark> nice to be up at Darcie's parents' cottage on Lake Huron
2013-12-30T18:06:41 <colinclark> very snowy and scenic
2013-12-30T18:06:55 <colinclark> I got a lot of books and new laptop backpack
2013-12-30T18:07:00 <colinclark> and nice socks
2013-12-30T18:07:54 <colinclark> So, I thought I'd fire up a fresh VirtualBox with Ubuntu 12.04 on it
2013-12-30T18:08:11 <colinclark> I didn't encounter any of the errors Chris Veigl is experiencing
2013-12-30T18:08:19 <colinclark> but, interestingly, the system doesn't seem to run
2013-12-30T18:08:28 <sgithens> that's awesome!... not
2013-12-30T18:08:46 <sgithens> what happens
2013-12-30T18:08:51 <colinclark> complaining about, essentially, an undefined Matchmaker
2013-12-30T18:09:54 <colinclark> Cannot autoInit component gpii.matchMaker which does not have an initFunction and gradeNames defined
2013-12-30T18:10:16 <colinclark> gpii.matchMaker is probably a base grade for the actual Matchmaker implementations, though I don't know for sure
2013-12-30T18:10:24 <colinclark> Are you running the latest universal on your machine, sgithens?
2013-12-30T18:10:53 <sgithens> hmm.  Yeah.  I was on master everything when doing merging last week. (except the v0.2 ticket)
2013-12-30T18:11:14 <sgithens> I'm going to blame it on GPII-75 which looks like the only thing that has changed since then :p
2013-12-30T18:11:36 <sgithens> but I can do another scratch build this evening
2013-12-30T18:12:16 <colinclark> Yeah, I was thinking it might well be related to GPII-75
2013-12-30T18:12:16 <colinclark> I'll continue to poke around a bit
2013-12-30T18:13:29 <sgithens> I would like to take a moment though, and say I've never merged so many pull requests where everything worked everytime I went to do the next pull request. ( Thanks jhernandez !)  Testing the xrandr and volume ones on linux was pretty cool
2013-12-30T18:14:40 <colinclark> jhernandez is continually blowing my mind with his work ethic and attention to detail, I have to say
2013-12-30T18:14:52 <sgithens> Also, between NFC tags and keeping a Makey Makey around, we can drive everything and eat the dogfood
2013-12-30T18:20:19 <colinclark> Do you have a Makey Makey, sgithens?
2013-12-30T18:21:14 <sgithens> no, but I got Hannah one for christmas, and now I want one to attach to stuff on my desk for various keyboard macros :)
2013-12-30T18:21:20 <sgithens> It's pretty damn cool
2013-12-30T18:24:31 <colinclark> nice
2013-12-30T18:27:34 <sgithens> colinclark: I also got a copy of the Selfish Gene which I'm enjoying.  What are your book highlights?
2013-12-30T18:28:50 * misuris joined the channel
2013-12-30T18:29:12 <colinclark> A new Jonathan Lethem novel
2013-12-30T18:29:19 <colinclark> Two books by Chris Hedges, War is a Force That Gives us Meaning and American Fascists
2013-12-30T18:29:28 <colinclark> and Being and Time by Martin Heidegger
2013-12-30T18:29:38 * misuris has quit
2013-12-30T18:29:44 <colinclark> which will probably keep me busy for quite a while
2013-12-30T18:30:15 <sgithens> awesum
2013-12-30T18:31:33 <sgithens> colinclark: ooo, let me show you the latest draft
2013-12-30T18:31:42 <sgithens> from christmas eve morning hacking
2013-12-30T18:34:59 <sgithens> http://githens.org/fluid-js-doc-dec24.html
2013-12-30T18:35:23 <sgithens> I have the non-API ones pulling out now
2013-12-30T18:36:59 <colinclark> nice!
2013-12-30T18:37:02 <colinclark> it's coming along
2013-12-30T19:09:35 <colinclark> Interestingly, sgithens, it seems to run fine on a fresh install of Fedora 20
2013-12-30T19:09:40 <colinclark> so I wonder what's different?
2013-12-30T19:11:40 <sgithens> I wonder if some of the extensions failed to build
2013-12-30T19:12:00 <sgithens> when that happens there is usually no visible sign and sometimes other things break
2013-12-30T19:12:19 <sgithens> I wish that javascript require() would make lots of noise when modules can't be found
2013-12-30T19:13:08 <colinclark> Yes
2013-12-30T19:13:20 <colinclark> I find Kettle, in particular, has a tendency to be very quiet when it shouldn't be
2013-12-30T19:13:27 <colinclark> I'll take a look
2013-12-30T19:13:36 <colinclark> The only difference between my Fedora installation and Ubuntu was that I built Node.js from source
2013-12-30T19:13:45 <colinclark> since the packages listed on the install page didn't seem to work
2013-12-30T19:14:47 <colinclark> I really feel like some day I could switch to Fedora
2013-12-30T19:15:00 <sgithens> you might want to just quick comment out the requires in gpii.js and see if it starts up
2013-12-30T19:15:04 <sgithens> you mean from OS X?
2013-12-30T19:15:07 <colinclark> Yeah
2013-12-30T19:15:15 <colinclark> I worry a bit about Thunderbird
2013-12-30T19:15:21 <colinclark> and life in LibreOffice seems a bit bleak
2013-12-30T19:15:29 <colinclark> not that Word isn't bleak in its own way
2013-12-30T19:15:36 <sgithens> thunderbird is a little clunky but it's my jam
2013-12-30T19:15:46 <colinclark> but GNOME Shell seems oddly familiar
2013-12-30T19:16:20 <colinclark> kasparnet seems to have a pretty good Thunderbird workflow now
