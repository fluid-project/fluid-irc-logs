2013-09-26T16:21:25 <colinclark> aha
2013-09-26T16:21:26 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-26T16:21:37 <colinclark> I was just looking at Chris\' email about localizing his PMT work
2013-09-26T16:21:41 <colinclark> it looks like there\'s a lot there
2013-09-26T16:21:54 <colinclark> quite a bit of raw jQuery that could be factored better
2013-09-26T16:22:06 <colinclark> and perhaps some misunderstandings about how it all fits together
2013-09-26T16:22:27 <colinclark> do you think it makes sense to fork his repository and illustrate how to do it there?
2013-09-26T16:24:14 <justin_o> colinclark: maybe.. it seems like alexander is trying to use the message bundles though. So using his code as an example might be enough.. not sure.. also cindyli and I are working on documentation about how to use the message bundles in the preferences framework. I told chris and alexander on the call this morning about it and that we\'d send them a link to the docs when they were ready.
2013-09-26T16:24:34 <colinclark> Cool
2013-09-26T16:37:37 <colinclark> justin_o: I had mentioned that I was going to share the writing I did on the Preferences Framework for the PGA design document. I\'ve posted it to the GPII wiki here, in case you\'re interested: http://wiki.gpii.net/index.php/Preferences_Framework_Overview
2013-09-26T16:37:59 <justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2013-09-26T16:51:51 <justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: could you please review the documentation i\'ve written for using message bundles in the preferences framework http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Localization+in+the+Preferences+Framework
2013-09-26T16:52:11 <anastasiac> sure, justin_o
2013-09-26T16:52:22 <anastasiac> which reminds me...
2013-09-26T16:52:31 <anastasiac> justin_o, michelled, cindyli, Bosmon, colinclark, on the topic of docs: I\'ve created JIRAs for docs tasks. I propose we use the "Needs Commit" status to indicate "needs review"
2013-09-26T16:52:37 <anastasiac> so for example, after justin_o has drafted the i18n docs, he can set the status to "needs commit" and assign it to whoever he thinks should do a technical review.
2013-09-26T16:52:41 <anastasiac> At the end, docs tasks could be assigned to me for a final editorial review. What you you all think of this idea?
2013-09-26T16:52:45 <anastasiac> Does it make sense? or is that overloading the \'needs commit\'? other concerns?
2013-09-26T16:55:21 <justin_o> anastasiac: seems fine to me
2013-09-26T16:55:47 <justin_o> anastasiac: by the way, is there a jira for i18n?
2013-09-26T16:56:06 <colinclark> anastasiac: I think it makes sense to me, yes
2013-09-26T16:56:20 <colinclark> seems like quite a reasonable use of "needs commit"
2013-09-26T16:56:54 <anastasiac> justin_o: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5156
2013-09-26T16:57:53 <justin_o> anastasiac: oh great.. okay.. i\'ll change that to needs commit then and assign to cindyli
2013-09-26T16:58:03 <anastasiac> :-)
2013-09-26T17:01:15 <justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: once those docs are in good enough shape we need to send the link off to the folks on the GPII list. They are in need of them to complete their work.
2013-09-26T17:01:49 <anastasiac> k. cindyli, once you\'ve double-checked the docs for technical stuff, assign the jira to me

2013-09-26T18:37:30 <cindyli> sure, justin_o

2013-09-26T19:04:14 <cindyli> anastasiac: I added another section onto the doc for the message bundle and done with it. have assigned the jira to you for the final guard: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Localization+in+the+Preferences+Framework
2013-09-26T19:04:35 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli, I\'ll have a look
2013-09-26T19:04:40 <cindyli> nice. thanks
2013-09-26T19:18:15 <anastasiac> cindyli, did you get a chance to review the fluid.messageLoader page? http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/fluid.messageResolver  It hasn\'t been edited since 2010, so there\'s a chance that it might be a wee bit out of date :-)
2013-09-26T19:18:34 <anastasiac> sorry, messageResolver
2013-09-26T19:19:36 <cindyli> no, i didn\'t review it. I will try but not sure if I can get everything right. perhaps you or Bosmon8 can take a look after
2013-09-26T19:19:54 <cindyli> anastasiac: ^
2013-09-26T19:20:05 <anastasiac> yeah, cindyli, it might take a quick double-check of the code itself
2013-09-26T19:20:20 <cindyli> ya
2013-09-26T19:34:48 <anastasiac> cindyli, can I come sit with you for a minute to double-check some things about the localization documentation?
2013-09-26T19:34:56 <cindyli> sure
