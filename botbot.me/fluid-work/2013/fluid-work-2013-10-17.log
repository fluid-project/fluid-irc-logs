b'2013-10-17T18:06:32 <Justin_o> if i do something similar to this, but in the strings block.. i get an error that the messageResolver is undefined.. in my object that handles the path resolution.
2013-10-17T18:09:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s the example of the string block case http://pastie.org/8409907
2013-10-17T18:09:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t believe we have support in the renderer for expressing the arrays within a UISelect as an array of references
2013-10-17T18:09:29 <Bosmon> Can\'t you fix your pathSegmentResolver so it is able to resolve an entire array at a time?
2013-10-17T18:11:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t know how.. the strings in the message bundles are only identified by a namespace in the key... So I would have two issues. 1) how do i find the values since the lookup function on the messageResolver requires the entire key name for its searches 2) I need the strings back in a particular order and have no way of passing that in as an
2013-10-17T18:11:01 <Justin_o> arguments when using resolvePathSegments
2013-10-17T18:12:32 <Bosmon> You could set up some special configuration in the component\'s "options" holding the index, which your resolver then resolves
2013-10-17T18:14:11 <Justin_o> not sure i follow that
2013-10-17T18:14:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2013-10-17T18:18:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - an index like this
2013-10-17T18:18:47 <Bosmon> textFont: ["textFont-default", "textFont-times", "textFont-comic", "textFont-arial", "textFont-verdana"]
2013-10-17T18:23:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so something like stringIndex: { textFont: [...], other: []} and then a search for {that}.stringBundle.textFont, which would return an array of strings.
2013-10-17T18:23:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2013-10-17T18:23:42 <Justin_o> okay.. how do you like the name stringIndex?
2013-10-17T18:24:03 <Bosmon> It\'s fine... perhaps stringArrayIndex would be more descriptive
2013-10-17T18:24:13 <Justin_o> okay..
2013-10-17T18:24:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ll give that a try

2013-10-17T18:54:03 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - how are you doing these days?
2013-10-17T18:54:07 <Bosmon> Haven\'t heard from you for a while : P
2013-10-17T18:55:03 <cindyli> Bosmon: I guess you might be glad that I don\'t bug you much these days :)
2013-10-17T18:55:16 <cindyli> working on aux builder again for composite panel
2013-10-17T18:55:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool - how is it going?
2013-10-17T18:58:14 <cindyli> coming along well. i\'ve finished off the part to construct grades for the composite panel. working on the last test case to make sure the parsing on the full schema, which contains both regular single level panels and composite panels, works fine
2013-10-17T19:03:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: still getting the messageResolver is undefined
2013-10-17T19:03:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, is it undefined? : P
2013-10-17T19:03:35 <Justin_o> only when i try to use it :)
2013-10-17T19:03:45 <Bosmon> Perhaps you are trying to use it the wrong way :)
2013-10-17T19:04:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have a test on an onCreate event that works, but using it in the prototree throughs the error

2013-10-17T19:04:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - when does it throw the error?
2013-10-17T19:06:26 <Justin_o> i take back my previous statement, i forgot to remove one of the old uses in the strings block
2013-10-17T19:06:36 <Justin_o> now it\'s just the parser complaining.. so looking into that now
2013-10-17T19:06:42 <Bosmon> ok
2013-10-17T19:06:59 <Bosmon> For reference, if you plan to resolve members of the component "early", you should do so via an IoC reference
2013-10-17T19:07:12 <Bosmon> Perhaps I should have you write the documentation page for the "ginger process and why it is useful" : P
2013-10-17T19:11:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) i\'m not sure that would turn out useful if i write it
2013-10-17T19:11:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, it works.. thanks for your help with this.. i\'ll clean up our implementations to use this style now and submit a pull request
2013-10-17T19:13:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: looks like slidingPanel also uses a lookup in the resolver.. but this is a separate component.. and it\'s not a renderer component :(
2013-10-17T19:30:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - is it a problem?
2013-10-17T19:37:38 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli: I\'ve filed a JIRA for that template path issue with the UI Options component: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5181
2013-10-17T19:37:45 <anastasiac> I\'ll add it to the iteration page

2013-10-17T20:01:37 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o: Do you think that the integrators of the uiOptions component might want access to an afterRender event?
2013-10-17T20:03:22 <cindyli> anastasiac: which "afterRender"? actual panels or the top UIO?
2013-10-17T20:04:35 <anastasiac> cindyli, I guess that\'s the question. Why might an integrator want to know about an afterRender? I\'d guess it would be so that they could be confident that what they think of as "ui options" has been rendered, so whatever afterRender event would signify that "everything is ready"
2013-10-17T20:07:03 <Bosmon> Hi avtar - I\'ve been looking at static publishing solutions and "punch" struck my eye
2013-10-17T20:07:05 <Bosmon> http://laktek.github.io/punch/
2013-10-17T20:07:15 <Bosmon> It seems less offensive than many of these things typically are :)
2013-10-17T20:08:09 <cindyli> anastasiac: integrators should listener to prefEditor -> onReady event. a good news is, options for prefEditor have already been surfaced up with distribute options.
2013-10-17T20:09:01 <anastasiac> cindyli, by "already", do you mean in master now?
2013-10-17T20:09:09 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac
2013-10-17T20:09:46 <anastasiac> but I can\'t add a listener to onReady right in the fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor() options block, cindyli

2013-10-17T20:28:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it is a bit of a problem.. first the slidingPanel is outside the scope of panels.. so if we want to use the functionality that I have just written, we will need to move it out somewhere more general. Perhaps it could be part of a new grade that the rendererComponent uses as a base grade 2) the sliding panel has an expectation of having a
2013-10-17T20:28:38 <Justin_o> messageResolver, but it doesn\'t have one by default. I don\'t think.
2013-10-17T20:28:55 * thealphanerd joined the channel
2013-10-17T20:29:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this can just be an additional dynamic grade supplied to the slidingPanel
2013-10-17T20:30:20 <Bosmon> All it requires is 2 strings named "showText" and "hideText" in any case
2013-10-17T20:30:33 <Bosmon> So this isn\'t going to break the abstraction bank : P
2013-10-17T20:30:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m worried about this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/slidingPanel/js/SlidingPanel.js#L32-L45
2013-10-17T20:30:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o
2013-10-17T20:30:51 <Bosmon> You can just override it!
2013-10-17T20:30:55 <Bosmon> This is how configuration works : P
2013-10-17T20:31:25 <Justin_o> that by default it expects a msgBundle.. but when it is out of the context of the preference framework it doesn\'t actually have one
2013-10-17T20:31:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o ^
2013-10-17T20:31:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^ :)
2013-10-17T20:32:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o ^ : P
2013-10-17T20:32:06 <Bosmon> Configuration!
2013-10-17T20:32:08 <Bosmon> Override!
2013-10-17T20:32:23 <Justin_o> i can override, sure i just think the default configuration is broken as it stands
2013-10-17T20:32:43 <Justin_o> that by default it should have plain strings and not expect the message bundle
2013-10-17T20:32:49 <Bosmon> Oh yes, it may well be
2013-10-17T20:32:58 <Bosmon> We should have sorted that out when we broke it out as a new component
2013-10-17T20:33:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, very true.. okay... i\'ll take care of this with my changes for FLUID-5180 as well
2013-10-17T20:33:41 <Bosmon> As well as its dreadful use of the hard-coded constant "400" etc.
2013-10-17T20:34:06 <Bosmon> And its awful old-fashioned "finalInit" function etc.

2013-10-17T12:22:20 <Justin_o> amilchev: hello
2013-10-17T12:23:10 <amilchev> Justin_o: I fixed some of the comments on the pull request https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/6, but some of them I couldn\'t
2013-10-17T12:24:18 <amilchev> Justin_o: how do you suggest handling the breaking of the UI when "save/reset/cancel" button is pressed, I guess reloading the page isn\'t an option..
2013-10-17T12:25:55 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-17T12:25:59 <amilchev> I know chris had the same problem but didn\'t understand how it was fixed
2013-10-17T12:26:09 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-17T12:27:26 <Justin_o> amilchev: have you determined what is causing the breakage?
2013-10-17T12:32:59 <amilchev> Justin_o: well the animation listeners "onReady...." and "onSomeEvent...." are still there inside the component, but I don\'t know what exactly the save/reset/cancel buttons do - so no
2013-10-17T12:36:11 <Justin_o> amilchev: just trying to run your code.. i\'m getting 404 errors on MyInfusion.js and speakTextPanel.js
2013-10-17T12:36:44 <amilchev> Justin_o: hm that\'s weird.. let me see..
2013-10-17T12:40:36 <amilchev> Justin_o: I see no problem on my side
2013-10-17T12:41:27 <Justin_o> it\'s strange because it\'s working but i\'m getting 404 errors on those two.. they are at different paths than what you have in the head though..
2013-10-17T12:41:33 <Justin_o> you are not getting any 404 errors?
2013-10-17T12:43:19 <Justin_o> amilchev: okay.. i think i\'ve found the problem.. it\'s coming from the template "newestSpeakText.html"
2013-10-17T12:44:04 <Justin_o> amilchev: templates should be DOM fragments..
2013-10-17T12:45:28 <amilchev> Justin_o: I don\'t see any 404 errors, do you mean these paths are incorrect? https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/demos/speakTextAdjusterGroup/index.html#L20-L22
2013-10-17T12:47:54 <amilchev> Justin_o: do you mean that instead of this single container https://github.com/radmanovi4/prefsEditors/blob/divide-and-conquer/src/shared/adjusters/html/newestSpeakText.html#L4 there should be one similar to this for each adjuster?
2013-10-17T12:47:55 <Justin_o> amilchev: sorry.. i was looking at an old version of your code
2013-10-17T12:48:54 <amilchev> Justin_o: oh, sorry I didn\'t mention it in the first place..
2013-10-17T12:49:40 <Justin_o> amilchev: nope, my fault.. i mistyped a command in git and thought it had changed things, but it didn\'t.. i have it sorted out now and no more 404 errors :)
2013-10-17T12:49:48 <Justin_o> i\'ll take a look at the save/reset thing now
2013-10-17T12:49:58 <amilchev> Justin_o: thank you!
2013-10-17T12:50:31 <Justin_o> amilchev: i\'m going to guess there is an issue reading from the storage though as the UI remains broken after saving until i do a reset and then refresh.

2013-10-17T13:21:28 <Justin_o> amilchev: when you hit save and apply it seems to to close the panel without going through your logic which sets the model state.. also these values from the model are persisted in the cookie

2013-10-17T13:53:21 <amilchev> Justin_o: any progress?
2013-10-17T13:54:07 <Justin_o> amilchev: yes.. so i think the issue here is stemming around the state being held in uiOptions model instead of the panel
2013-10-17T13:54:30 <Justin_o> because it\'s there, the values are being persisted to the store as well...
2013-10-17T13:54:50 <Justin_o> i think changing this will be the first step to solving the issue
2013-10-17T13:58:40 <amilchev> ok si I moved this inside the speakTextCollectivePanel ...

2013-10-17T14:56:27 <amilchev> Justin_o: I moved practically all the content of speakText.js into the CollectivePanel and the result was visually the same as after hitting "save" - no errors, nothing moves, no "speak text" text ...
2013-10-17T15:03:30 <colinclark> Hey jessm, have you had a chance to look closely at the latest Pilots scenario document for Cloud4all?
2013-10-17T15:03:37 <colinclark> I know you\'ve been busy with the PGA doc
2013-10-17T15:03:46 <colinclark> michelled was just pointing something interesting about it out to me
2013-10-17T15:06:34 <jessm> colinclark: i have been glancing, but haven\'t had a good, long read. what interesting thing did michelled see?
2013-10-17T15:06:43 <colinclark> Task 1.2 is curious
2013-10-17T15:07:00 <colinclark> It involves proposing a new solution or assistive technology to the user
2013-10-17T15:07:23 <colinclark> The scenario, I think, is pretty problematic from several perspectives
2013-10-17T15:07:34 <colinclark> both in terms of pragmatics and our design vision
2013-10-17T15:08:03 <colinclark> The idea is that, if a preferred AT isn\'t present, a Matchmaker "recommends" something else to the user
2013-10-17T15:08:24 <jessm> yes
2013-10-17T15:08:48 <colinclark> We don\'t have any designs for this sort of a "messages" UI, do we?
2013-10-17T15:08:58 <colinclark> And presumably we want stuff to just happen
2013-10-17T15:09:03 <colinclark> and seamlessly
2013-10-17T15:09:19 <colinclark> rather than involving any kind of explicit "yes, Matchmaker, do that" step
2013-10-17T15:13:16 <jessm> we do not have any messages yet
2013-10-17T15:13:59 <jessm> yet we\'ve said pretty consistently I think (and hope!) that we won\'t make changes without giving the user the opportunity to confirm them.
2013-10-17T15:17:23 <jessm> colinclark: i think i should sit down with Fish today and inch through these tables. Eleni said they weren\'t quite updated - ugh.
2013-10-17T15:22:37 <colinclark> I guess the issue is partially "getting in the door"
2013-10-17T15:22:58 <colinclark> For a user who needs a screenreader, how do you even send them messages and allow them to confirm if you don\'t launch a screenreader?
2013-10-17T15:24:12 <michelled> I suppose it might mean a self voicing message. but I feel like it\'s extra steps that might be annoying
2013-10-17T15:24:36 <michelled> on the other hand, if the user gets an AT launched that they have no idea how to interact with, that will stop them in their tracks
2013-10-17T15:25:51 <colinclark> yes, that\'s very true
2013-10-17T15:28:21 <kasparnet> colinclark, michelled, jessm: apparently the first of the matchmaker interaction scenario was something that was discussed with claudia and not needing to be implemented
2013-10-17T15:28:36 <kasparnet> ie. the one with webanywhere and the question of which matchmaker to launch
2013-10-17T15:32:58 <colinclark> kasparnet: Can you clarify?
2013-10-17T15:33:14 <colinclark> Are you saying Eleni and Claudia decided that this Task 1.2 won\'t be tested in the Pilots?
2013-10-17T15:38:05 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah - so 1.2.1 was something that Claudia suggested, but that we dont _need_ to implement it
2013-10-17T15:38:05 * amilchev has left the channel
2013-10-17T15:38:57 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-17T15:39:13 <colinclark> Are the Matchmakers capable of making these kinds of recommendations?
2013-10-17T15:39:24 <colinclark> What\'s the format that a Matchmaker users to communicate messages to the rest of the framework?
2013-10-17T15:42:32 <kasparnet> colinclark: I guess they are.. the format is still undecided, but probably part of their return payload (JSON)
2013-10-17T15:43:08 <colinclark> In the current Matchmakers, does it involve a two-way conversation, or simply a message?

2013-10-17T18:00:14 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - could you give more details on your problems with resolving the message bundles?
2013-10-17T18:00:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello sure..
2013-10-17T18:01:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so part of the base issue is that i need an array of strings to pass into the optionnames property of a input protoTree.
2013-10-17T18:02:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in the messge bundle there are no arrays, instead they are grouped with a namespaced key.
2013-10-17T18:03:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so when trying to use my new strings bundle there is no direct way to get at the group directly. So i\'m trying to construct the array manually using IoC references like {that}.stringBundle.contrast-bw.
2013-10-17T18:03:35 <Justin_o> if i do this in the prototree, it just outputs the IoC refernces as an unexpanded string..
2013-10-17T18:03:56 <Bosmon> Where have you written them in the prototree
2013-10-17T18:03:57 <Justin_o> so i\'ll actually get {that}.stringBundle.contrast-bw written out to the UI.
2013-10-17T18:04:01 <Bosmon> Remember that we have a special syntax for this
2013-10-17T18:04:05 <Bosmon> Do you recall the changes that yzen made?
2013-10-17T18:04:24 <Bosmon> IoC references in the prototree are required to appear in the form ${{that}.stringBundle.contrast-bw}
2013-10-17T18:04:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i\'ve reverted all of it, but will write you up an example
2013-10-17T18:04:43 <Bosmon> At least in certain places where a "valuebinding" is required
2013-10-17T18:04:59 <Bosmon> The standard syntax may be used in "light" material such as decorators etc.

2013-10-17T18:05:45 <Justin_o> that\'s what i tried to do in the prototree
