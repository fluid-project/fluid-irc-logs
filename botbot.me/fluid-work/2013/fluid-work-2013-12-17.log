b'2013-12-17T19:45:08 <jhung> Justin_o - sure. I\'ll pull down the changes and take a look at that. Anything else?
2013-12-17T19:45:33 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m done with the video panel. anything i can help with?
2013-12-17T19:46:00 <cindyli> michelled: i sent a pull request to improve the video panel - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/pull/11, can you take a look when you have a chance? Thanks.
2013-12-17T19:46:02 <Justin_o> jhung: i think that was it.. also did you want the side panel to show/hide with the metadata
2013-12-17T19:46:10 <jhung> Justin_o: do you have a branch?
2013-12-17T19:46:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. would you like to pair up with me on FLOE-125
2013-12-17T19:46:29 <jhernandez> sgithens: okay, just wanted to ask about using different configs on Android (NODE_ENV). Don\'t remember well if you already said something related to this issue
2013-12-17T19:46:31 <Justin_o> jhung: yes.. FLOE-128 in my repo
2013-12-17T19:46:37 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2013-12-17T19:46:38 <jhung> ok
2013-12-17T19:47:51 * yzen joined the channel
2013-12-17T19:48:37 <sgithens> jhernandez: I don\'t think I commented about it at all.  You mean like different configs for kettle and the diff GPII components/
2013-12-17T19:48:38 <sgithens> ?
2013-12-17T19:48:47 <Justin_o> yzen: couchdb question for you
2013-12-17T19:48:59 <yzen> sure
2013-12-17T19:49:00 <jhernandez> sgithens: yes!
2013-12-17T19:49:03 <Justin_o> yzen: if i have a document in couch can i save to different paths within in it..
2013-12-17T19:49:13 <yzen> like el paths
2013-12-17T19:49:15 <yzen> no
2013-12-17T19:49:22 <yzen> I\'m pretty sure not
2013-12-17T19:49:23 <Justin_o> for example if the document has model: {url: "", other: ""}
2013-12-17T19:49:24 <Justin_o> yes
2013-12-17T19:49:38 <Justin_o> yzen: so you have to save the whole document all the time?
2013-12-17T19:49:59 <yzen> yes
2013-12-17T19:50:10 <yzen> as far as i know it\'s not like mongo
2013-12-17T19:50:25 <Justin_o> yzen: ;(
2013-12-17T19:50:38 <jhernandez> sgithens: in linux we can do the "NODE_ENV=anyconfig ./start.sh" thing, but AFAIK we can\'t do the same in Android
2013-12-17T19:51:27 <sgithens> jhernandez: oh i see. hmm, I might take a look at it tonight while I"m finishing merging your pulls
2013-12-17T19:51:39 <sgithens> I hadn\'t even thought about that previously
2013-12-17T19:51:52 <jhernandez> sgithens: heh, no problem
2013-12-17T19:51:52 <michelled> thx cindyli, I\'ll take a look
2013-12-17T19:53:31 * clown has quit
2013-12-17T19:53:46 <jhernandez> sgithens: at least, and for the pilots, we can add some additional "gpii.js" files, from where we can launch the framework with different configs
2013-12-17T19:54:14 <jhernandez> ie: gpii_rbmm.js, gpii_stmm.js, etc ...
2013-12-17T19:54:47 <sgithens> it might be a cool option to add to the app GUI too
2013-12-17T19:54:57 * jhernandez nods
2013-12-17T19:55:25 <jhernandez> btw, I have recently updated GPII-277, GPII-397 and GPII-398
2013-12-17T19:55:46 <jhernandez> (just in case you\'re with them)

2013-12-17T20:08:43 <michelled> cindyli: can you tell me a bit about the \'primary\' and \'secondary\' captions?
2013-12-17T20:09:01 <michelled> Justin_o: ^
2013-12-17T20:09:45 <Justin_o> michelled: what would you like to know :)
2013-12-17T20:10:01 <michelled> well, what does it mean to be primary or secondary?
2013-12-17T20:10:40 <Justin_o> michelled: basically there are two captions inputs on the page. primary corresponds to the first one, and secondary to the second.. if that makes sense..
2013-12-17T20:11:15 <Justin_o> in the future we\'ll change this up and possibly use dynamic components instead, to support a growing set of captions.
2013-12-17T20:11:57 <michelled> I\'m not quite getting it Justin_o. how would I decide which is primary and which is secondary? what would my choice end up meaning?
2013-12-17T20:14:33 <Justin_o> michelled: you mean as a user
2013-12-17T20:14:39 <michelled> yes
2013-12-17T20:14:40 <Justin_o> i just means which order the captions are added to your video
2013-12-17T20:14:43 <Justin_o> it
2013-12-17T20:29:30 * cindyli has quit
2013-12-17T20:37:41 <michelled> Justin_o: so, it\'s the order that I\'ll see them in the drop down list when the video is displayed?
2013-12-17T20:37:52 <michelled> and also determines which one is the default caption?
2013-12-17T20:37:58 <michelled> is that right?
2013-12-17T20:38:04 <Justin_o> michelled: yes.. that\'s correct
2013-12-17T20:38:33 <michelled> ok. I wonder if we should represent that as an array of captions
2013-12-17T20:39:00 <michelled> do you know if there\'s a reason we went with two different objects "primaryCaption" and "secondaryCaption"?
2013-12-17T20:39:53 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-12-17T20:41:43 <Justin_o> michelled: cindyli is probably better to answer that, but i believe it had to do with ensure that the model was correct even if the user added  caption in the second field and not the first, or deleted the one from the first after adding one to the second and etc.
2013-12-17T20:42:50 <michelled> cindyli, Justin_o: and did we decide to start with two instead of multiple because it is simpler?
2013-12-17T20:43:27 <cindyli> yes, michelled
2013-12-17T20:44:14 <michelled> it sounds just like the repeatable component that yzen made for cspace
2013-12-17T20:44:36 <michelled> I guess we really should think about generalizing that. it seems to come up fairly often
2013-12-17T20:48:22 <cindyli> michelled: let me see if dynamic components can be used for this
2013-12-17T20:48:36 <michelled> ok
2013-12-17T20:49:09 <michelled> cindyli: if not, can you put a TODO in the code that reminds us that we plan to change this in the future?
2013-12-17T20:49:19 <cindyli> sure, michelled
2013-12-17T20:49:26 <michelled> thx

2013-12-17T16:13:39 <michelled> Justin_o: I faintly remember that you had a wiki page that described how to first set up git on your machine including creating an ssh key that you would register with github

2013-12-17T17:28:39 <jhung> Justin_o: Can you help me resolve a merge conflict? I pushed up my branch FLOE-128 and trying to merge Master. There\'s a conflict in metadata.html.
2013-12-17T17:29:07 <Justin_o> jhung: so you just want me to pull down your branch and merge it with master?
2013-12-17T17:29:23 <jhung> Justin_o: yes if possible.
2013-12-17T17:29:42 <Justin_o> jhung: no problem.. anything else, of is FLOE-128 done after that?
2013-12-17T17:30:12 <jhung> Justin_o floe-128 should be done after that unless something doesn\'t look right.

2013-12-17T17:39:13 <colinclark> anastasiac: You have found yourself in some pretty bizarre company in this current thread on the schema.org list ;)
2013-12-17T17:40:08 <colinclark> http://thecostofknowledge.com/
2013-12-17T17:40:46 <anastasiac> thanks for the link, colinclark
2013-12-17T17:41:16 <colinclark> It\'s a fairly nuanced question, this issue of DRM and accessibility metadata
2013-12-17T17:41:45 <anastasiac> colinclark, what\'s your take on the issue being discussed on the list?
2013-12-17T17:41:52 <colinclark> Unquestionably, digital rights management has represented one of the single most substantial obstacles to accessibility
2013-12-17T17:42:35 <colinclark> In that it actively prevents the adaptation or transformation of a resource to suit a user\'s needs
2013-12-17T17:45:39 <colinclark> My impression is that Madeline\'s position is fairly moderate
2013-12-17T17:46:17 <colinclark> and that one role for automatic inference would be to detect various forms of DRM and automatically fill out the appropriate metadata to decelerate the resource in accessible in these fundamental ways
2013-12-17T17:46:24 <colinclark> display transformability, for example
2013-12-17T17:46:38 <colinclark> or whatever this has evolved into
2013-12-17T17:57:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you fix the issue with the restart button not clearing the metadata panel?
2013-12-17T17:59:04 <cindyli> yes, yesterday, Justin_o. pushed up and told jhung_away
2013-12-17T17:59:22 <Justin_o> which branch is that in?
2013-12-17T17:59:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: https://github.com/cindyli/metadata/tree/FLOE-125
2013-12-17T18:00:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks.. i\'ll merge that into my FLOE-128 branch and test it out
2013-12-17T18:00:46 <cindyli> great. thanks, Justin_o
2013-12-17T18:01:19 <Justin_o> cindyli:  looks like it\'s working, thanks
2013-12-17T18:01:48 <cindyli> np
2013-12-17T18:05:21 <Bosmon> colinclark - could you unpack "decelerate the resource in accessible in these fundamental ways"?
2013-12-17T18:06:50 <colinclark> ack
2013-12-17T18:06:52 <colinclark> freaking autocorrect
2013-12-17T18:07:18 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-12-17T18:07:22 <Justin_o> cindyli:  i found another bug, if you refresh the page after adding in a video, the metadata panels aren\'t present.
2013-12-17T18:07:29 <colinclark> that was "declare the resource inaccessible"
2013-12-17T18:07:29 <colinclark> I need to turn this feature off, it\'s hostile to my typing tendencies
2013-12-17T18:07:45 <colinclark> Netflix is a great example of the issue with DRM
2013-12-17T18:07:53 <colinclark> Let\'s say that a particular Netflix program lacks captions
2013-12-17T18:08:02 <Bosmon> ok, yes
2013-12-17T18:08:08 <colinclark> and let\'s say that there is a service that can do on-demand realtime captioning
2013-12-17T18:08:16 <colinclark> or viable speech recognition for auto captioning
2013-12-17T18:08:40 <colinclark> clearly, by the very nature of its DRM strategy, a Netflix program is inaccessible to this kind of adaptation
2013-12-17T18:09:15 <colinclark> especially considering that our definition of accessibility is founded on the notion that it\'s an interaction between the needs of the user and the flexibility of the system to deliver on those needs
