b"2018-06-20T21:22:07 <gmoss> I think this is the third time today that I've read or heard something about an app that will tell consumers the source of the products they're considering
2018-06-20T21:22:25 <gmoss> the emphasis on storytelling is cool too
2018-06-20T21:23:10 <danayo> interesting gmoss, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s the latest thing
2018-06-20T21:23:16 <danayo> and a good thing :)
2018-06-20T21:23:21 <gmoss> so it would seem, danayo!
2018-06-20T21:23:23 <gmoss> :)
2018-06-20T21:23:56 <gmoss> ethical consumption, or at least the semblance of it
2018-06-20T21:24:04 <danayo> I requested a demo from them gmoss, I think (their site gave me no feedback that my request was submitted :( )
2018-06-20T21:24:25 <gmoss> haha, let's hope you hear back then, danayo
2018-06-20T21:24:44 <gmoss> you could always check your network tab in the browser's inspector window ;P
2018-06-20T21:25:01 <gmoss> (you'd have to resubmit for that)
2018-06-20T21:25:45 <danayo> oh interesting gmoss
2018-06-20T21:25:52 <danayo> ok, i opened it and saw nothing
2018-06-20T21:26:07 <danayo> you mean I\xe2\x80\x99d have to have it open when I make the request? to see the activity?
2018-06-20T21:26:50 <gmoss> oh sorry, I was being facetious! it would be a way to ensure that your message was sent successfully, even if the site didn't give you any feedback
2018-06-20T21:27:11 <gmoss> but it would be an onerous process. and yeah you'd have to open the tab and THEN make the request
2018-06-20T21:27:12 <gmoss> etc etc
2018-06-20T21:27:18 <danayo> yeah crazy
2018-06-20T21:27:33 <danayo> would much prefer a \xe2\x80\x9cyour request has been submitted\xe2\x80\x9d message
2018-06-20T21:27:35 <danayo> :)
2018-06-20T21:27:37 <gmoss> agreed!
2018-06-20T21:28:13 <gmoss> ping gtirloni
2018-06-20T21:29:09 <gmoss> gtirloni: can you please confirm that the dockerfile being added in your PR is for the build site CI to work more smoothly? I wonder if it will affect the server site builds...
2018-06-20T21:33:15 <gtirloni> gmoss: hi, yeah, should not have any impact. it's just for CI
2018-06-20T21:33:49 <gmoss> gtirloni: thanks! I've merged it in
2018-06-20T21:33:51 <gtirloni> i need to send another PR for the -server part of it (in alanharnum's repo SJRK-56 if i'm not mistaken) that should impact CI/builds though...
2018-06-20T21:33:54 <gtirloni> gmoss: thank you!
2018-06-20T21:36:49 * danayo has quit
2018-06-20T21:36:53 <alanharnum> gtirloni: there's actually two of them because we deploy two versions of the site from slightly different branches: https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-story-telling-server/tree/SJRK-56-learningReflections / https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-story-telling-server/tree/SJRK-56-karisma
2018-06-20T21:37:04 <alanharnum> we're working on that awkwardness

2018-06-20T16:28:53 <the-t-in-rtf> darn it.
2018-06-20T16:29:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I had the afternoon off and planned to come back in but missed the timing.
2018-06-20T16:29:11 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry!
2018-06-20T16:29:28 <clown> don\'t sweat it.

2018-06-20T16:29:54 <the-t-in-rtf> still not cool, but I\'ll forgive myself some day.

2018-06-20T21:06:18 <danayo> looks like they are open to feedback, so perhaps we could make a suggestion ...
2018-06-20T21:09:57 <danayo> alanharnum, gmoss: an interesting use of storytelling - brand marketing related to food sourcing and sustainability http://lookin.to/index.html
2018-06-20T21:11:51 <danayo> and looks like they have created a story-gathering tool
