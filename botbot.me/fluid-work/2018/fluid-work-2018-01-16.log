2018-01-16T12:46:54 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I can talk for about 15 mins now if that helps
2018-01-16T12:47:44 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Sure, we will call you on Skype
2018-01-16T12:49:05 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: haha yes, more like Bosmon says I\'m happy to work together into something, It\'s true that some stuff is very \'fine grain\' but well, it\'s better that way, discussion is never bad!

2018-01-16T15:08:57 <simonjb> would be great to get your thoughts

2018-01-16T16:03:01 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: We\'ll be starting our weekly planning meeting at 11:15 EST
2018-01-16T16:07:02 <Bosmon> Oh hey simonjb
2018-01-16T16:07:10 <Bosmon> Yes, in theory I am always in favour of getting rid of tables
2018-01-16T16:07:31 <Bosmon> It\'s just my knowledge of CSS didn\'t extend to how to get the alignment right where each row has a label of different length
2018-01-16T16:09:49 <simonjb> Bosmon: I was thinking of using nested ULs together with ARIA markup
2018-01-16T16:14:20 <simonjb> Bosmon: I can try some quick experiments, but at this stage you don\'t have objections or reasons why it\'s a terrible idea?
2018-01-16T16:17:27 <Bosmon> simonjb - none other than the alignment, no
2018-01-16T16:17:42 <Bosmon> I had heard of various modern CSS tricks that could achieve this but I never seemed to be able to get them to work
2018-01-16T16:17:47 <Bosmon> But my experimentation was not very thorough
2018-01-16T16:18:10 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, which alignment in particular?

2018-01-16T16:29:22 * jhernandez joined the channel
2018-01-16T16:32:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - each line of the table has a label in the left column
2018-01-16T16:32:24 * kasparnet has quit
2018-01-16T16:32:34 <Bosmon> It would be nice if the left column automatically sized itself to about the width of the longest label
2018-01-16T16:33:10 <Bosmon> gtirloni - now I have merged the-t-in-rtf \'s pull for code coverage and test tasks, it looks like our CI configuration now fails
2018-01-16T16:33:19 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-01-16T16:33:21 <gtirloni> ok, i\'ll fix that. one sec
2018-01-16T16:33:22 <Bosmon> It would be great if we could get it updated so that it runs the new "npm test" task
2018-01-16T16:33:25 <Bosmon> That\'s awesome
2018-01-16T16:33:48 <Bosmon> And I wonder if there is some way we could surface some statistics from the code coverage run in the output which gets attached to pull requests?
2018-01-16T16:34:33 <Bosmon> Either some literal text in the message, or perhaps a link to the "reports" directory which is generated by the CI process
2018-01-16T16:34:47 <Bosmon> I forget what the longevity of these is like, but did we decided to keep them around for a while?
2018-01-16T16:34:59 <simonjb> Bosmon: got it, in the latest designs, the left column labels are more like headers now: https://issues.gpii.net/secure/attachment/18200/VisibleNexusUI_Exploration_V5_SS.pdf
2018-01-16T16:35:32 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I see now
2018-01-16T16:35:39 <Bosmon> I guess that is a lot more ul-like anyway
2018-01-16T16:35:45 <Bosmon> As well as using space more efficiently
2018-01-16T16:36:02 <Bosmon> As you know my visual aesthetic got stuck some time in the mid-90s :)

2018-01-16T17:10:27 <gtirloni> Bosmon: the issue with jenkins CI is fixed, a build just completed. regarding the code coverage statistics, they show up almost at the end of the console output (https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-tests/127/console) -- I think we should talk to Avtar to see if his work on BuildKite can be modified to show that, I\'m not aware of a Jenkins plugin to do that (but can look into it)
2018-01-16T17:10:51 <Bosmon> gtirloni - awesome
2018-01-16T17:10:56 <Bosmon> Is he away at the moment?
2018-01-16T17:11:26 <gtirloni> seems like it, i\'m not sure if he\'s working today
2018-01-16T17:13:44 <alanharn_> Bosmon simonjb: If you\'re trying to do things with alignment, css and layout, I\'d recommend looking at CSS Grid - at this point it\'s got good support in all modern browsers
2018-01-16T17:13:45 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-01-16T17:14:33 <alanharn_> it can do a lot things with alignment that are classically difficult to accomplish with pure CSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout

2018-01-16T18:07:56 <ussjoin> On the one hand, yeah, on the other hand, my *god* the NRE. "With Curie, we become the first major non-telecom company to build a private intercontinental cable."

2018-01-16T18:10:45 <ussjoin> And yes. This article is *really* long, but it\'s the groundwork for what become Cryptonomicon.
2018-01-16T18:10:56 <mrtyler> which i have read
2018-01-16T18:10:59 <ussjoin> And it is, to me, a completely fascinating look at what it really takes to lay ocean cables.
2018-01-16T18:11:26 <ussjoin> FWIW it\'s worth it even if you\'ve read Cryptonomicon, this talks a lot more about what he spends like three sentences on in the book.
2018-01-16T18:12:00 <ussjoin> ANyway, I only finally read it like three years ago (when the collection of his nonfiction writing came out), but I hugely recommend it. It still holds interest, not just as a historical curiosity.
