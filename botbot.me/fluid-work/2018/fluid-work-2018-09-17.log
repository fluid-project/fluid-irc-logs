2018-09-17T12:14:39 <dandimitrov> Hey, stegru. About the DPI problem we discussed - do you think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a mechanism that you can provide us with through the `gpii-windows` that can help us deal with it :?
2018-09-17T12:14:51 <dandimitrov> The problem was related to system modifications as a result of a DPI change that haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet taken place when the corresponding Electron event is fired...

2018-09-17T14:33:36 <cindyli> hi, stegru, one thing about applying high contrast theme to windows. I thought with this solution registry change, a top level preference with
2018-09-17T14:33:38 <cindyli> {
2018-09-17T14:33:38 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrast/enabled": true,
2018-09-17T14:33:38 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrastTheme": "white-black"
2018-09-17T14:33:38 <cindyli> }
2018-09-17T14:33:56 <cindyli> will trigger the high contrast to be applied to windows
2018-09-17T14:34:13 <stegru> I\'d expect that, too
2018-09-17T14:34:35 <cindyli> but i found to trigger this apply, it still need
2018-09-17T14:34:37 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/com.microsoft.windows.highContrast": {
2018-09-17T14:34:38 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrast/enabled": true,
2018-09-17T14:34:38 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrastTheme": "white-black"
2018-09-17T14:34:38 <cindyli> }
2018-09-17T14:34:50 <stegru> oh I see
2018-09-17T14:35:18 <cindyli> the matchmaker output for the top level high contrast only apply high contrast to UIO+
2018-09-17T14:36:18 <stegru> yes that\'s what I get, I think that\'s a matchmaker problem - but i don\'t know enough about the MM to be sure
2018-09-17T14:36:52 <stegru> removing UIO+ from the SR makes the high-contrast solution work
2018-09-17T14:37:02 <cindyli> ok
2018-09-17T14:38:45 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-09-17T14:39:04 <stegru> by the way, just setting highContrastTheme (to anything except "regular-contrast") also enables high-contrast
2018-09-17T14:41:08 <cindyli> stegru: enables high contrast on both windows and UIO+?
2018-09-17T14:44:20 <cindyli> here\'s my double check result for applying high contrast theme using the top level high contrast prefs:
2018-09-17T14:44:26 <stegru> sorry no, cindyli
2018-09-17T14:44:30 <cindyli> 1. removing UIO+ from the SR makes the high-contrast solution work for windows
2018-09-17T14:44:58 <stegru> 1. correct
2018-09-17T14:45:01 <cindyli> 2. with UIO+ in SR, high contrast only applies to UIO+ regardless the high contrast value
2018-09-17T14:45:08 <cindyli> same as your result
2018-09-17T14:45:12 <stegru> 2. correct
2018-09-17T14:45:19 <cindyli> ya, seems a MM problem
2018-09-17T14:45:34 <cindyli> :(
2018-09-17T14:45:35 <stegru> damn it, kaspar
2018-09-17T14:45:47 <cindyli> lol poor kasper
2018-09-17T14:48:18 <stegru> I don\'t believe it\'s specific to high-contrast or UIO+ - maybe it\'s not possible to select several solutions from a single preference
2018-09-17T14:48:48 <cindyli> that\'s possible too
2018-09-17T14:49:52 <stegru> and perhaps the reason UIO+ works, is because it\'s listed after the built-in one
2018-09-17T14:50:21 <cindyli> if so, the application level prefs are both needed if QSS wants to apply high contrast to both
2018-09-17T14:51:07 <stegru> yes, it appears that way, cindyli
2018-09-17T14:52:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you know how MM is supposed to work with handling the top level high contrast preference? ^
2018-09-17T14:53:48 <cindyli> the answer will affect how this preference should be defined in qssSettings.json in my snapshotter work: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3318/testData/solutions/qssSettings.json5#L8-L9
2018-09-17T14:54:43 <cindyli> and very likely affect the input prefs for high contrast from QSS too
2018-09-17T15:10:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - the MM is meant to work by dispatching it to all available solutions
2018-09-17T15:10:19 <Bosmon> By the current implementation, this is encoded through "high contrast" not appearing in the so-called "apptology"
2018-09-17T15:10:38 <Bosmon> The apptology was Kaspar\'s stop-gap solution for preventing one preference being fielded out to multiple applications
2018-09-17T15:12:56 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-09-17T15:17:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: i see. so the proper fix should be on MM
2018-09-17T15:17:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes - but is it not already dispatching the preference to both solutions?
2018-09-17T15:17:57 <cindyli> nah
2018-09-17T15:18:32 <cindyli> only dispatched to UIO+
2018-09-17T15:19:01 <cindyli> removing UIO+ from SR will help MM to dispatch to windows
2018-09-17T15:19:04 <cindyli> but not both
2018-09-17T15:20:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - since high contrast doesn\'t appear in here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/mappings/flat-apptology.json5 - this is not the expected behaviour
2018-09-17T15:21:20 <cindyli> umm\xe2\x80\xa6. shall i create a JIRA?
2018-09-17T15:33:40 * danayo joined the channel
2018-09-17T15:38:00 <dandimitrov> stegru, sorry for the slow answer - the problem is the following: The main idea is that we want to rescale all of our Browser windows once a change to the DPI is made. When a DPI change is made the system starts applying changes to the screen. Currently, there\'s an Electron event that we\'re using, which notifies us that a change to the "display metrics" (which includes both DPI and resolution changes) is present. Part of the problem seems to be th
2018-09-17T15:38:00 <dandimitrov> the system hasn\'t yet been fully updated when the event is sent. We thought a timeout would solve this but application time varies between machines - on a slower machine the changes may be applied way slower...
2018-09-17T15:38:05 <dandimitrov> So I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering whether we could get notified that changes to screen have been made by some other means.
2018-09-17T15:45:04 <stegru> danayo, I\'m not aware of any methods other than what\'s already being used. if you can detect (in code) if the timeout is too soon, then you could make another timeout until it\'s ready
2018-09-17T15:45:14 <stegru> sorry danayo - i meant to say dandimitrov

2018-09-17T19:18:35 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks for replying to my message the other day. It turns out the issue with the node tests for UIO+ was within having the extension running in Chrome. Not sure if this was related to the change in Node or not, although I hadn\'t seen that problem for a long time. In the end I changed the port used in the test and things seemed to be okay afterwards.
