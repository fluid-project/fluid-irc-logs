b'2018-09-05T13:55:09 <georgitodorov> cindyli: I see. So there are other branches that need to be merged in universal\'s master so that all QSS cases can be covered?
2018-09-05T13:55:23 <cindyli> one sec, i think noUser keyin work shouldn\'t affect the QSS login, you should only hit this error when changing a prefs that is not part of the user prefs
2018-09-05T13:55:57 <cindyli> exactly, georgitodorov. i\'m still working on other functionalities
2018-09-05T13:56:29 * colinclark has quit
2018-09-05T13:56:30 <cindyli> to provide what\'s in feds-audit
2018-09-05T13:58:24 <georgitodorov> cindyli: I see. Do you have a rough estimate of when that work might be ready?
2018-09-05T13:59:12 <cindyli> 2-3 weeks, i think, georgitodorov
2018-09-05T14:00:12 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, in a clean VM if I create the directories, all of the DEFAULT.JCF files are corrupt, i.e. they only contain a single zero.
2018-09-05T14:01:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I get an error like the following on login: file argument must be a non-empty string.
2018-09-05T14:03:12 <cindyli> georgitodorov: can i still use this gpii-app branch to see errors you hit - https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/feature/QSS
2018-09-05T14:04:14 <georgitodorov> cindyli: In this case we should plan whether your revised work can be included in the AJC build or if we should continue using the feds-audit branches with some more code added to them. We can discuss that on our status call next Monday
2018-09-05T14:04:36 <cindyli> sure
2018-09-05T14:04:46 <georgitodorov> cindyli: We have a new branch for the Microsoft demo: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/feature/QSS1.1
2018-09-05T14:05:05 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2018-09-05T14:06:45 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: the \'0\' is a bug in the ini file writer (I\'ve now seen where it is)
2018-09-05T14:07:03 <the-t-in-rtf> forged license to kill
2018-09-05T14:07:08 <the-t-in-rtf> they left a bit off
2018-09-05T14:07:11 <stegru> the files should be empty, because the ini data is an empty object
2018-09-05T14:07:21 <cindyli> georgitodorov: i should be able to see the error by pointing gpii-windows to https://github.com/danailbd/windows/tree/feds-audit, right?
2018-09-05T14:07:27 <the-t-in-rtf> good to know.
2018-09-05T14:07:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Are you around tomorrow or Friday to pair for a little?
2018-09-05T14:07:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru ^
2018-09-05T14:07:54 <stegru> and the error is due to the registry resolver for the executable returning ""
2018-09-05T14:07:55 <stegru> yes
2018-09-05T14:08:03 <the-t-in-rtf> great, I will look for you then.
2018-09-05T14:08:07 <the-t-in-rtf> and thanks for your help today.
2018-09-05T14:08:10 <stegru> it\'s ok

2018-09-05T16:19:33 <the-t-in-rtf> @clown, I don\'t know if you saw in the chat, but I have used fluid.promise.sequence extensively
2018-09-05T16:19:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I am happy to review code you\'re stuck on or pair during our overlap.
2018-09-05T16:19:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I have good overlap on Friday, for example.
2018-09-05T16:20:14 <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks for the offer, and I\'ll probably take you up on it.
2018-09-05T16:20:28 <clown> and, yes, I missed that in the gotmeeting chat.
2018-09-05T16:21:10 <clown> right now, I\'m just studying it to see what it does/how it works so I don\'t have code that usess it yet.  Maybe by Friday.
2018-09-05T16:21:19 <clown> what is the overlap time?
2018-09-05T16:21:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I get grumpy if I need to meet any later than 17:30 CET on a Friday, so from as early as you like until around 11:00?
2018-09-05T16:21:49 <the-t-in-rtf> (your time)
2018-09-05T16:22:21 <clown> getting grumpy on a Fri afternoon makes sense.
2018-09-05T16:22:43 <clown> okay.  I\'ll try for 9:30 then \xe2\x80\x94 thanks.
2018-09-05T16:23:03 <clown> does sergio hang out here or in #fluid-tech?
2018-09-05T16:23:09 <clown> I don\'t know his IRC name.
2018-09-05T16:24:01 <clown> Re "I\'ll try for 9:30 then"  That\'s 9:30 my time, if that\'s not obvious the-t-in-rtf.
2018-09-05T16:26:02 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s perfect, I picked up an 8:30 your time and would love an excuse to hold them to time... ;)
2018-09-05T16:26:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I sent an invite.

2018-09-05T12:10:55 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, has your INI pull been merged?
2018-09-05T12:11:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I am refreshing my work before testing my JAWS data, currently I\'m working off your branch.
2018-09-05T12:12:01 <stegru> this one? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/648
2018-09-05T12:12:02 <stegru> no
2018-09-05T12:12:02 <the-t-in-rtf> nm, I can see that it hasn\'t.
2018-09-05T12:12:36 <stegru> it\'s a tiny fix that can be picked (or pasted)
2018-09-05T12:17:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I was able to merge with upstream master without any problems.
2018-09-05T12:17:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, did you work on the metrics stuff?
2018-09-05T12:17:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I am trying to test JAWS 2018 and the metrics say "solution-failed", I\'d like to track that back to a cause.
2018-09-05T12:18:00 <stegru> what metrics stuff?
2018-09-05T12:18:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess not then.
2018-09-05T12:18:20 <the-t-in-rtf> there are now metrics in the logs, like "solution-failed"
2018-09-05T12:18:20 <stegru> oh, yes, i was the one who implemented the metrics
2018-09-05T12:18:46 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a good default response, people think you\'re not able to help with anything... ;)
2018-09-05T12:19:05 <stegru> haha yes
2018-09-05T12:19:11 <stegru> don\'t ask me, i only work here
2018-09-05T12:19:19 <the-t-in-rtf> We had one of the senior JIRA devs in our office for a while and of course wanted to pick his brain, and of course he was like "I don\'t really know" when he\'d written half of it.
2018-09-05T12:19:39 <stegru> i bet he hated you :)
2018-09-05T12:21:16 <stegru> ok, from looking at the metrics code, you can read "solution-failed" as "solution not applied"
2018-09-05T12:21:32 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the problem is that my specific settings file requires that solution
2018-09-05T12:21:46 <the-t-in-rtf> let me find the link (it\'s in a branch, it\'ll be a minute)

2018-09-05T12:39:28 <the-t-in-rtf> well, it\'s correctly reporting the failure
2018-09-05T12:39:36 <stegru> oh! ok
2018-09-05T12:39:39 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the solution is not launched and the settings file isn\'t written.
2018-09-05T12:39:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to understand why.
2018-09-05T12:43:14 <stegru> line 2405 has a \'\\\\\' at the end of the registry key
2018-09-05T12:44:12 <stegru> oh, so do others.. might not be important

2018-09-05T12:59:01 * simonjb joined the channel
2018-09-05T13:00:38 <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, and the 2018 entry doesn\'t have that.
2018-09-05T13:00:56 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s the 18.0 entry, which (confusingly) is not the same.
2018-09-05T13:00:59 <stegru> ok it looks like every jaws solution is being applied
2018-09-05T13:01:34 <the-t-in-rtf> really?  is JAWS launched?
2018-09-05T13:01:37 <stegru> i have no version installed, and it complained about the settings directories not existing, so i created each one as it complained
2018-09-05T13:02:01 <the-t-in-rtf> how are you confirming this?
2018-09-05T13:02:22 <stegru> keying in as "jaws-2018"
2018-09-05T13:02:54 <the-t-in-rtf> So, are actual settings written?
2018-09-05T13:02:57 <stegru> it first complained about 17.0/Settings/enu + VoiceProfiles... then same for 18.0, and 2018
2018-09-05T13:03:05 <the-t-in-rtf> because they aren\'t for me.
2018-09-05T13:04:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I also really would like to understand why it would write settings for all three since that setting file clearly expresses a preference for JAWS 2018.
2018-09-05T13:04:48 <stegru> I guess they all pickup "http://registry.gpii.net/common/screenReaderTTS/enabled"
2018-09-05T13:05:24 <stegru> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/GPII-2225/testData/preferences/jaws-2018.json5#L24
2018-09-05T13:06:48 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but why is the priority not respected?
2018-09-05T13:06:54 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/GPII-2225/testData/preferences/jaws-2018.json5#L29
2018-09-05T13:07:33 <the-t-in-rtf> In other testing, if I have both NVDA and JAWS installed and key in with a set that has a priority, it launches whichever one is first in the list of solutions (at least that\'s how it seems)
2018-09-05T13:07:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, setting that aside for now, did it actually write any settings to the INI files?
2018-09-05T13:07:51 <stegru> ok, i don\'t know anything about that "metadata" block
2018-09-05T13:07:53 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru ^^^
2018-09-05T13:08:15 <stegru> yes/no... the settings files are written to, but there\'s a problem with the values
2018-09-05T13:08:28 * cindyli joined the channel

2018-09-05T13:09:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I am just baffled.
2018-09-05T13:09:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Nothing is actually written to the settings file for me.
2018-09-05T13:09:55 <stegru> bear in mind, i\'m writing to a fresh ini file
2018-09-05T13:10:01 <the-t-in-rtf> interesting.
2018-09-05T13:10:16 <the-t-in-rtf> so if I (for example) renamed the file it might work?
2018-09-05T13:10:21 <the-t-in-rtf> let me try that.
2018-09-05T13:10:25 <stegru> ok
2018-09-05T13:11:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, nope.
2018-09-05T13:11:36 <the-t-in-rtf> didn\'t write a new file, didn\'t start JAWS
2018-09-05T13:11:58 <the-t-in-rtf> where are you testing?
2018-09-05T13:12:06 <the-t-in-rtf> A bespoke VM, one of our vagrant images, bare iron?
2018-09-05T13:12:20 <the-t-in-rtf> also, what branch of master?
2018-09-05T13:12:28 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, branch of universal.
2018-09-05T13:12:42 <stegru> our vagrant, your universal (2225)
2018-09-05T13:12:52 <stegru> no jaws installed
2018-09-05T13:13:23 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, let me blow away fhe VM and see if I see at least that.
2018-09-05T13:13:26 <stegru> but with my ini-write-fail branch merged
2018-09-05T13:13:37 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, my windows repo has that.
2018-09-05T13:13:54 <stegru> windows? that\'s a universal thing
2018-09-05T13:14:23 <the-t-in-rtf> what the actual fuck.
2018-09-05T13:14:32 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry.
2018-09-05T13:14:36 <stegru> oh tony!
2018-09-05T13:14:39 <the-t-in-rtf> But I mean testing the login from windows.
2018-09-05T13:14:48 <stegru> ah ok
2018-09-05T13:15:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I am spinning up a standard VM from my copy of windows/master with only the version of universal changed.
2018-09-05T13:15:17 <the-t-in-rtf> which sounds exactly like what you\'ve done.
2018-09-05T13:15:27 <the-t-in-rtf> the only difference is that I installed JAWS 2018 in the VM.
2018-09-05T13:15:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m trying a new VM to make sure there are no traces of a JAWS install.
2018-09-05T13:16:08 <the-t-in-rtf> and then creating the dir that should hold the settings file.
2018-09-05T13:16:40 <stegru> ok, well, adding a break-point where the ini file is written shows that an empty object is being passed
2018-09-05T13:16:41 <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-ini-file/index.js#L349
2018-09-05T13:16:48 <the-t-in-rtf> thank you very much for that.
2018-09-05T13:16:49 <stegru> for all files except 17.0
2018-09-05T13:17:06 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, 17.0 is the base grade
2018-09-05T13:17:19 <the-t-in-rtf> which seems to suggest that something is not able to work with my new solution resolver
2018-09-05T13:17:32 <stegru> ok
2018-09-05T13:18:55 <stegru> maybe escaping the dots in the solution name?
2018-09-05T13:19:14 <the-t-in-rtf> we didn\'t have to do that with 17.0
2018-09-05T13:19:26 <the-t-in-rtf> AFAIK you only have to do that for capabilities transforms.
2018-09-05T13:20:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, in previous sessions I\'ve clearly seen that the lifecycle manager was aware of the resolved data, but given that it\'s not launching any more, seems like I should recheck that.
2018-09-05T13:20:42 <stegru> i can\'t find the code for the solution resolver
2018-09-05T13:20:54 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s in my branch of universal
2018-09-05T13:20:56 <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec

2018-09-05T13:27:37 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I made a small PR to fix the issue the-t-in-rtf raised with the changes from KETTLE-66: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/47
2018-09-05T13:28:09 <the-t-in-rtf> he\'s at a conference today, I\'d suggest mentioning him in the PR.

2018-09-05T13:42:27 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, the first two settings in the preference "Options.Abbreviations" and .Acronyms aren\'t in any supportedSettings block.. should they be HTML.Abbreviations?

2018-09-05T13:44:54 <the-t-in-rtf> good catch, I\'ll fix that shortly.
2018-09-05T13:45:09 <the-t-in-rtf> although it doesn\'t really explain why you get a more or less complete INI file and I get nothing.
2018-09-05T13:45:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if it\'s broken, shouldn\'t it be broken everywhere?
2018-09-05T13:46:20 <stegru> yeh i just changed the preference set and it made no difference
2018-09-05T13:46:48 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Hey Cindy! We are trying the new `noUser` work with the gpii-app and we have stumbled upon two errors:
2018-09-05T13:46:51 <georgitodorov> - some strange JSON exception on init (apparently from some logger) - https://pastebin.com/CcWr1VBh
2018-09-05T13:47:02 <georgitodorov> - and an exception whenever we try to login or change a setting - https://pastebin.com/iEW3jqZ5 and https://pastebin.com/tiX4i2Ez
2018-09-05T13:47:13 <georgitodorov> Overall we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any of the changes in the QSS/PSP take effect. Is there some other configuration file that we should use?
2018-09-05T13:48:12 <georgitodorov> As there is no new version of gpii-windows that we can use, we made a fork of gpii-windows which points to your version of universal. But we are probably missing something
2018-09-05T13:49:36 <georgitodorov> This is a link to our fork: https://github.com/danailbd/windows/tree/feds-audit
2018-09-05T13:50:26 <georgitodorov> Perhaps the easiest option will be if a new version of gpii-windows is created so that we can reference it. Can you or someone else do it as we remembered that Antranig is off until the end of the week

2018-09-05T13:52:59 <cindyli> georgitodorov: the noUser work is the base work for responding to QSS changes, but it doesn\'t cover as enough functionalities as what are in the feds-audit branch. with the work in the master, it can not respond to QSS changes on preferences that are not part of user existing prefereces.
2018-09-05T13:53:23 <cindyli> the 2nd error when trying to login or change a setting is expected
2018-09-05T13:53:53 <cindyli> i don\'t have a clue on the first error. need some debugging to find out
