2018-04-30T17:41:56 <cindyli> colinclark, simonjb: is this Thursday, May 3, 1pm EDT good for you to have the next PPT meeting?
2018-04-30T17:42:29 * VictorNG joined the channel
2018-04-30T17:45:07 <cindyli> sgithens: in the next PPT meeting, i'm think one agenda item is the new prefs server APIs for PPT. I wonder if you expand https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2966 before the meeting, for example, the input and output that PPT expect for each new endpoint
2018-04-30T17:45:30 <cindyli> you expand -> you could expand

2018-04-30T10:18:15 <kasparnet> Esta en la calle de estrella. Hay un burro alli, que se llama Juan
2018-04-30T10:18:22 <kasparnet> hey dude
2018-04-30T10:18:26 <kasparnet> how are things?
2018-04-30T10:18:58 <jhernandez_> xD
2018-04-30T10:19:04 <jhernandez_> pretty good, pretty good
2018-04-30T10:19:20 <jhernandez_> can\'t complain
2018-04-30T10:19:29 <jhernandez_> lots of work to do in the new house
2018-04-30T10:19:59 <jhernandez_> step by step, it\'s becoming to look like a house
2018-04-30T10:20:06 <jhernandez_> how about you?
2018-04-30T10:21:26 <jhernandez_> are you already swimming in koronas thanks to your brilliant new shiny project? :P
2018-04-30T10:21:31 <jhernandez_> xD
2018-04-30T10:48:25 <kasparnet> haha, nope not exactly
2018-04-30T10:49:18 <kasparnet> I\'m just eating off my savings, and I imagine it\'ll continue like that for a while
2018-04-30T10:49:31 <kasparnet> but it\'s fine... I sort of saw that coming
2018-04-30T10:50:30 <kasparnet> great to hear with the new house! Is it major stuff that needs to happen, or just "smaller" things like moving furnitures around, a bit of painting, etc?
2018-04-30T10:51:08 * kasparnet_ has quit
2018-04-30T10:51:24 <kasparnet> phew, glad to get rid of that bastard
2018-04-30T10:52:16 <kasparnet> I was going through all the RtF stuff laying around to see if there was anything I could sell so I could get something to eat
2018-04-30T10:52:58 <kasparnet> and besides two laptops, 3 wooden hands and a big-ass conference call kit, I have a Vaio laptop
2018-04-30T10:53:16 <kasparnet> Gregg suggested that I sent it to you, jhernandez_, if you didn\'t already have one
2018-04-30T10:53:50 <kasparnet> and if you did, that I sent it to stegru (if he didn\'t have one already)
2018-04-30T10:55:43 <jhernandez_> heh, wrt the house, a little bit of everything, but we keep it cool - now we are doing small stuff and saving some budget for future "bigger" stuff/renovations
2018-04-30T10:57:12 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2018-04-30T10:57:13 <jhernandez_> about the vaio ... I already have one, and I think stegru have one too, not sure
2018-04-30T10:58:23 <kasparnet> ... everyone have vaios
2018-04-30T10:58:26 <jhernandez_> heh
2018-04-30T10:58:28 <jhernandez_> yes
2018-04-30T10:58:35 <jhernandez_> but not the wooden hands!!
2018-04-30T10:58:37 <jhernandez_> :P
2018-04-30T10:58:39 <stegru> yeh a 2nd one is no use to me
2018-04-30T10:58:45 <kasparnet> haha, no
2018-04-30T10:59:01 <kasparnet> nope
2018-04-30T10:59:27 <kasparnet> I guess gregg wants to keep it in europe
2018-04-30T10:59:37 <stegru> I wonder if javjarfer[m] has one?
2018-04-30T10:59:38 <jhernandez_> send it to me if you want, I have space for it here
2018-04-30T10:59:44 * Justin_o joined the channel
2018-04-30T10:59:47 <jhernandez_> yes, I was thinking about JJ
2018-04-30T10:59:59 <jhernandez_> probably we would like to have one too
2018-04-30T11:00:00 <stegru> he\'d only sell it, though :/
2018-04-30T11:00:05 <jhernandez_> javjarfer[m]: ?
2018-04-30T11:00:12 <jhernandez_> stegru: you\'re right
2018-04-30T11:00:17 <kasparnet> hahaha, yes, typical spaniard

2018-04-30T12:04:49 <stegru> what warning?
2018-04-30T12:05:13 <kasparnet> We found a potential security vulnerability in one of your dependencies.
2018-04-30T12:05:25 <kasparnet> A dependency defined in ./package-lock.json has known security vulnerabilities and should be updated.
2018-04-30T12:05:58 <kasparnet> it\'s for the hapijs/hoek dependency
2018-04-30T12:06:21 <kasparnet> " Only users who have been granted access to vulnerability alerts for this repository can see this message." .. it says
2018-04-30T12:07:34 <kasparnet> I\'m not gonna comment on whether it\'s particularly smart to grant this kind of access to the kasparnet...

2018-04-30T15:08:17 <kasparnet_> stegru, has the windows built process changed recently
2018-04-30T15:08:42 <stegru> kasparnet_: on master, no I don\'t think so
2018-04-30T15:08:45 <stegru> why?
2018-04-30T15:08:56 <kasparnet_> I\'m trying to build a box with the latest windows VM and just doing a: vagrant up
2018-04-30T15:09:02 <kasparnet_> and it keeps giving me errors
2018-04-30T15:09:48 <kasparnet_> first signs of explosions is: heat.exe : warning HEAT5151: Could not harvest data from a file that was expected to be an assembly: C:\\installer\\temp\\GPII\\windows\
ode_modules\\edge\\lib\\bootstrap\\bin\\Release\
etcoreapp1.0\\bootstrap.dll. If this file is not an assembly you can ignore this warning. Otherwise, this error detail may be helpful to diagnose the failure: Could not load file or assembly \'System.Runtime, Version=4.1.0.0,
2018-04-30T15:09:49 <kasparnet_> Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. [C:\\installer\\setup\\setup.msbuild]
2018-04-30T15:10:12 <stegru> let me try it on a new box
2018-04-30T15:10:21 <stegru> but that error is a friendly error
2018-04-30T15:10:36 <kasparnet_> I get a bunch of those, and then: C:\\installer\\setup\\setup.msbuild(61,5): error : Return Code 16. Serious error. RoboCopy did not copy any files. This is either a usage error or an error due to insufficient access privileges on the source or destination directories.
2018-04-30T15:10:36 <kasparnet_> Done Building Project "C:\\installer\\setup\\setup.msbuild" (default targets) -- FAILED.
2018-04-30T15:12:16 <kasparnet_> I did update my VM box, and I imagined that cleared it completely, but I could delete my VM and provision a new if you think that\'d help
2018-04-30T15:14:23 <stegru> have you tried it with master, kasparnet_ ?
2018-04-30T15:14:39 <kasparnet_> no, actually not... that might be a good idea :)
2018-04-30T15:17:07 <stegru> you could also try "vagrant up --provision", to give it another try
2018-04-30T15:19:00 <stegru> or just comment out the line in Vagrantfile that contains "Installer.ps1" - I presume you don\'t need to build the installer
2018-04-30T15:23:55 <kasparnet_> ok, cheers stegru.. will try that out
