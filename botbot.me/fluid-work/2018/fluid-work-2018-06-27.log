2018-06-27T16:01:22 <stegru> come on, jhernandez
2018-06-27T16:01:39 <stegru> vamos

2018-06-27T16:41:20 <mrtyler> hi gtirloni, our ansible CI builds have started failing with a new error:
2018-06-27T16:41:20 <mrtyler> TypeError: unbound method construct_mapping() must be called with Constructor instance as first argument (got Loader instance instead)
2018-06-27T16:41:24 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-06-27T16:41:26 <mrtyler> https://ci.gpii.net/job/ansible-gpii-ci-worker/93/display/redirect
2018-06-27T16:41:38 <mrtyler> looks like this is affecting multiple ansible roles that haven't changed in months
2018-06-27T16:41:48 <mrtyler> did something change on h5? does this look familiar to you in any way?
2018-06-27T16:41:49 * michelled joined the channel
2018-06-27T16:42:29 <gtirloni> interesting, our docker builds are failing with segfault error
2018-06-27T16:44:30 <gtirloni> i don't think anything has changed. i've deleted some buildkite directories yesterday/today but that was all
2018-06-27T16:44:48 <gtirloni> lots of virtualbox processes stuck it seems
2018-06-27T16:45:46 <gtirloni> if nothing else important is running, i can reboot the machine.. that's the kind of error we were getting with virtualbox that required the daily restarts
2018-06-27T16:47:36 * simonjb has quit
2018-06-27T16:49:15 <mrtyler> gtirloni: go ahead and reboot, thanks
2018-06-27T16:49:27 <mrtyler> i'm not optimistic it will help with the ansible test issue, but it's a fine place to start :)
2018-06-27T16:50:04 <mrtyler> fwiw i have made changes in the last couple days, but only to things like kubectl and kops. should not affect ansible or docker builds in any way

2018-06-27T17:26:11 <gtirloni> ok, same error after the reboot... interesting, and docker continues to give me a segfault

2018-06-27T17:41:37 <gtirloni> i tried a previous CPU microcode but didn't help (as expected -- the host had 26days uptime).. anyway.. weird issue

2018-06-27T18:18:29 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf I was thinking about your idea to create an infusion component for reloading our couch views similar to the one for reloading handlebars templates, and was just wondering what tools from the couchapp suite of utils do you use regularly when developing
2018-06-27T18:27:08 <neuralmilkhotel> fluid-everyone: For today's community meeting we have Jennifer Jahnke and Aiann Oishi to talk about the Accessible Media Program at Mohawk College. Meeting notes: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+Meeting+%28June+27%2C+2018%29%3A+Accessible+Media+Production+program+at+Mohawk+College

2018-06-27T18:45:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, none at all any more.
2018-06-27T18:45:32 <the-t-in-rtf> When P4A was still on, only couchapp itself.

2018-06-27T18:59:14 <Bosmon> sgithens, the-t-in-rtf - haven't cindyli and klown been working on a couch data loader?
2018-06-27T19:01:35 * alanharnum has quit
2018-06-27T19:02:48 <sgithens> Bosmon: Yeah, but I was thinking about adding something to watch the filesystem and repush it in to couch whenever you edit it during development

2018-06-27T19:50:05 <gtirloni> mrtyler: the ansible roles issue seems to be related to ansible-lint only, i submitted a PR: https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-gpii-ci-worker/pull/15
2018-06-27T19:50:30 <gtirloni> the docker segfault i'm getting seems to be related to node:8-alpine image, it works fine with node:8 image (debian-based)

2018-06-27T20:00:14 <gtirloni> i can't track the ansible-lint error to any changes in h-0005... i'm thinking pip just resolved a new list of dependencies that don't work well together (maybe with the newest ansible being the culprit)
2018-06-27T20:08:25 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-06-27T20:10:14 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i agree that seems the most likely culprit
2018-06-27T20:10:22 <mrtyler> thanks for the fix PRs :)
2018-06-27T20:10:28 <gtirloni> np!
