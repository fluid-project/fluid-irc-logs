2018-08-21T23:51:24 <Bosmon> Hey there gtirloni - I've lost my details for the Vidyo login portal.....
2018-08-21T23:51:45 <Bosmon> Is there a way to discover what the name of my account was?
2018-08-21T23:52:10 <gtirloni> sure, one sec
2018-08-21T23:52:37 <Bosmon> Also, what is the portal URL :)
2018-08-21T23:52:38 <Bosmon> Thanks
2018-08-21T23:55:56 <gtirloni> https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca
2018-08-21T23:56:22 <gtirloni> you can try resetting the password through here: https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/admin
2018-08-21T23:56:26 <gtirloni> or i can set a new one
2018-08-21T23:56:30 <Bosmon> I do remember the password
2018-08-21T23:57:17 <gtirloni> ok
2018-08-21T23:57:26 <Bosmon> Wow hey I'm logged in
2018-08-21T23:57:29 <Bosmon> Thanks so much :)
2018-08-21T23:57:36 <Bosmon> I finally upgraded my desktop after 10 years ....
2018-08-21T23:57:37 <gtirloni> you're welcome :)
2018-08-21T23:57:41 <gtirloni> oh!
2018-08-21T23:57:51 <gtirloni> is that the AMD box?
2018-08-21T23:57:53 <Bosmon> Although, heroically, I succeeded in installing Windows 7 on the new one :)
2018-08-21T23:58:00 <Bosmon> Even though this was widely declared to be impossible
2018-08-21T23:58:06 <Bosmon> It is
2018-08-21T23:58:10 <gtirloni> haha nice
2018-08-21T23:58:19 <Bosmon> It did take me a year to find the time to put it together ....
2018-08-21T23:58:47 <gtirloni> it's much easier these days but still a time sink yeah
2018-08-21T23:59:51 <Bosmon> I dunno, this was about as bad as installing a PC in the mid-90s :)

2018-08-21T10:19:08 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Hi, Javi! On the status call yesterday we talked about adding a reset icon on the desktop (when the PSP is installed) which will reset the QSS when clicked
2018-08-21T10:20:35 <georgitodorov> We were thinking of an icon which will try to launch the GPII app with a parameter (e.g. --reset). Then, if there is a running instance of GPII app, it will be notified that a second instance is trying to start and the already running instance will get notified instead
2018-08-21T10:21:26 <georgitodorov> As I am not very familiar with the installer process, can you tell me whether 2 icons for the same app can be created on the desktop when the application is installed
2018-08-21T10:21:59 <georgitodorov> And also how can their starting parameters be configured?

2018-08-21T10:32:57 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-08-21T11:10:55 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: hey
2018-08-21T11:11:14 <jhernandez> yes, adding a 2nd icon is fine
2018-08-21T11:11:31 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-08-21T11:11:42 <jhernandez> regarding parameters ...
2018-08-21T11:12:51 <jhernandez> not entirely sure how can we receive the parameters, but I guess that it should be doable
2018-08-21T11:14:27 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru or anyone familiar with windows solutions, is there a reason why this theme is duplicated? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L2075
2018-08-21T11:14:51 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, I guess we present it as both "yellow-black" and "black-yellow"?
2018-08-21T11:15:15 <stegru> yes it\'s not right the-t-in-rtf.. but there is a PR somewhere to fix it
2018-08-21T11:15:24 <the-t-in-rtf> great, I\'ll leave it be then.
2018-08-21T11:15:31 <the-t-in-rtf> plenty of crimes of my own to atone for.
2018-08-21T11:17:02 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: according to what I\'m seeing, it shouldn\'t be a problem at all, we can receive and parse parameters without any problems
2018-08-21T11:17:55 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-08-21T11:18:39 <jhernandez> also, FYI, this is what the "Start GPII" icon on the desktop does -> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/blob/HST/staging/start.cmd
2018-08-21T11:18:48 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, I didn\'t actually realise WebStudio could compare any file with an arbitrary file from the filesystem.
2018-08-21T11:18:56 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s super handy when reviewing your changes against master.
2018-08-21T11:19:17 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-08-21T11:19:28 <stegru> yes!
2018-08-21T11:19:41 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Great. So, can we have an additional icon with a different label which executes "start /min gpii-app.exe --reset"?
2018-08-21T11:20:01 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: yup
2018-08-21T11:20:48 <jhernandez> unless stegru or any other has a better idea to achieve this, I think that\'s the easiest path we can take
2018-08-21T11:22:32 <stegru> no
2018-08-21T11:24:55 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Okay. In this case I will modify the GPII code to handle the "--reset" command option and you can make the appropriate changes in the installer?
2018-08-21T11:26:09 <jhernandez> right
2018-08-21T11:27:09 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: don\'t waste your time in trying to understand how to include such icon in wix ;)
2018-08-21T11:28:08 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: :) I will send you a link to a branch with the functionality on our end later today

2018-08-21T17:00:57 <sgithens> cindyli: From our convo this morning, as far as the trusted local flowmanager goes, is there any production scenerio where that would ever be used, or can it be assumed that it is essentially just for demos and presentations of the system
2018-08-21T17:03:57 <cindyli> Bosmon2: what do you think ^

2018-08-21T17:08:27 <cindyli> sgithens: i don\'t have an answer. have a feeling it\'s very likely we will need to maintain both trusted and untrusted till at least the end of APCP
2018-08-21T17:09:40 <sgithens> cindyli Bosmon2 : Definately , I don\'t we need to get rid of it, I was just wondering what (if) there is an actual production real life use case for it that matches the security setup for it
2018-08-21T17:10:02 <sgithens> maybe the cached offline workstation version of the GPII or something

2018-08-21T17:13:15 <cindyli> sgithens: trusted flow manager works with GPII keys that are preloaded into the database, at the moment, from testData/preferences, so I think it only can deal with less sensitive keys/preferences such as demo keys or snapsets
2018-08-21T17:13:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think we should maintain them, yes, just so we can get some sense of what assumptions we are making in the architecture
2018-08-21T17:13:31 <Bosmon> I don\'t believe there is an imminent use case to them
2018-08-21T17:13:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - I just found this excellent series of cartoons :)

2018-08-21T17:14:23 <Bosmon> Hi there gtirloni - yes, the linting time will have increased very substantially with the new implementation contributed by the-t-in-rtf
2018-08-21T17:14:32 <Bosmon> Hopefully we can just increase the timeouts a bit further?
2018-08-21T17:14:41 <gtirloni> yep, certainly. i\'ll increase them
2018-08-21T17:15:45 <sgithens> also, Id like to say I really like the pager (even if it\'s 1 per page) widget for that site.  I really the scale of the timeline from beginning to end and how it\'s displayed and it behaves when you click elsewhere on it
