2018-10-04T15:13:17 <gmoss> Justin_o: that\'s a good question. if it ends up working in the fashion I\'m working towards, then the preference will be set when the panel\'s select is changed, it\'ll fire an event with the new locale as an arg, then that will be listened for by the UIO component which will hold onto the locale in its model and distribute it to its subcomponents for reloading/rerendering
2018-10-04T15:13:32 <gmoss> writing it all out seems mildly complicated. I wonder if there\'s a better way
2018-10-04T15:14:43 <Justin_o> gmoss: maybe a modelRelay from the preference to the locale, but it should probably only go in one direction. I don\'t think we want the components locale to set the users preference
2018-10-04T15:15:25 <gmoss> Justin_o: what about in the case where a website has language/locale selection within the page, as we have it with the storytelling tool?
2018-10-04T15:15:40 <gmoss> perhaps we shouldn\'t allow such an implementation
2018-10-04T15:17:50 <Justin_o> gmoss: yah i was thinking about that.. i suppose in that case they would not add the panel.
2018-10-04T15:18:47 <Justin_o> although I\'m not sure we want to allow/encourage for setting preferences outside of the editor. So maybe in those cases that preference isn\'t used at all..
2018-10-04T15:18:53 <Justin_o> still thinking about it
2018-10-04T15:19:09 <Justin_o> but i think you\'ll probably want to just use the language from UIO in the story telling tool
2018-10-04T15:19:15 <Justin_o> unless you think it\'s too complicated to get to
2018-10-04T15:19:36 <gmoss> Justin_o: fair enough, re not adding the panel. I\'m not sure quite what you mean by "use the language from UIO"
2018-10-04T15:19:47 <gmoss> we\'d still like to store it when it\'s set "in the page"
2018-10-04T15:20:33 <Justin_o> gmoss: maybe i don\'t know enough about the story telling tool.. but i was thinking that  the user could just toggle the language through your new language setting panel instead of something directly on the page.
2018-10-04T15:21:19 <gmoss> ah, yes that sounds reasonable, Justin_o. I think this is a good point for danayo to be aware of our plans ;)
2018-10-04T15:22:22 <danayo> thanks gmoss, let me get caught up on your chat
2018-10-04T15:23:20 <gmoss> danayo: specifically the part about removing the "in-page" language controls from the storytelling tool and having the UIO panel to control that instead. what do you think?
2018-10-04T15:27:09 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-10-04T15:27:45 <danayo> gmoss, Justin_o: is it possible that there will ever by an instance of the tool that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have UIO integrated?
2018-10-04T15:29:13 * gmoss is thinking hard about that one
2018-10-04T15:30:32 <michelled> there\'s no reason we couldn\'t have both controls if danayo thinks it\'s valuable
2018-10-04T15:31:04 <gmoss> michelled: in that case, it would have the sort of two-way relay that Justin_o and I were discussing, I think

2018-10-04T20:25:18 <cindyli> i wrote what i wanna ask in the pull request comment
2018-10-04T20:26:09 <cindyli> if you prefer not to merge the change for "gpii.settingsHandler.noSettings", i can close this pull request and issue another one only with the change to win32.json5
2018-10-04T20:27:25 <Bosmon> Ah wow
2018-10-04T20:27:35 <Bosmon> How interesting
2018-10-04T20:27:39 <Bosmon> I\'m happy to merge the whole thing
2018-10-04T20:27:57 <Bosmon> I\'m still puzzled that the system doesn\'t throw an exception trying to process the noSettings output : P
2018-10-04T20:29:21 <Bosmon> Did you just add a whole set of test cases for unrelated settings handlers?
2018-10-04T20:30:46 <cindyli> nah, i just renamed that test file name to camel case
2018-10-04T20:31:28 <cindyli> the first letter for "settingsHandlerUtilitiesTests.js" is now capitalized
2018-10-04T20:32:46 <Bosmon> OK
2018-10-04T20:32:56 <Bosmon> It\'s odd, shows up as a 100% addition in the interface
2018-10-04T20:33:06 <Bosmon> Anyway, the pull is fine, if you can just move the impl of NoSettings into its own file
2018-10-04T20:33:11 <cindyli> sure

2018-10-04T06:18:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, @sgithens.  That seems to confirm my hypothesis about a timing bug.

2018-10-04T09:37:35 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, about the zoomtext version - is that good or bad?
2018-10-04T09:37:45 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s something that needs verifying.
2018-10-04T09:37:48 <the-t-in-rtf> it might be either
2018-10-04T09:37:54 <the-t-in-rtf> my guess is it\'s probably fine.
2018-10-04T09:38:01 <stegru> ok
2018-10-04T09:38:07 <the-t-in-rtf> but we need to confirm that all settings are only keyed to the major version
2018-10-04T09:38:13 <the-t-in-rtf> which is the case for JAWS, so I kind of assume so.
2018-10-04T09:38:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I think your focus in the ticket on updating from 10 to 11 was probably all that\'s required.

2018-10-04T13:17:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. I\'m almost done working my way through your comments on the GPII-2914 PR. However, I\'m not quite sure what you mean by this one https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/14#discussion_r222485717
2018-10-04T13:18:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean a little structure like { "read": "onRead", etc.
2018-10-04T13:18:44 <Bosmon> Lookups are always preferably to mangled heaps of if statements since they are inherently more public and extensible
2018-10-04T13:19:01 <Bosmon> DECKLLARATIVE, y\'know : P
2018-10-04T13:19:31 <Justin_o> ah got you.. so a type to eventName map
2018-10-04T13:19:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2018-10-04T13:19:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - one of those
2018-10-04T13:21:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. so there is already some indirection in the CONSTANT name to the value and it would be easier if the value is used for looking up.
2018-10-04T13:21:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o - my earlier comments recommend eliminating the CONSTANT names
2018-10-04T13:22:01 <Justin_o> but then i\'d have to hardcode the value into the map in the options, which doesn\'t seem right
2018-10-04T13:22:12 <Justin_o> i kept the constants, but converted them to strings
2018-10-04T13:22:20 <Justin_o> but you think there shouldn\'t be constants at all?
2018-10-04T13:22:29 <Bosmon> I don\'t think there is a purpose having constants once you have strings
2018-10-04T13:22:35 <Bosmon> Why not just type the string rather than the constant?
2018-10-04T13:22:37 <Justin_o> i thought it made it easier to keep them consistent
2018-10-04T13:22:55 <Bosmon> I feel that constants are a bit of a remnant of the Java era where there was considered a special role to the compile-time
2018-10-04T13:23:25 <Justin_o> okay.. i\'ll just leave a comment somewhere about what\'s expected
2018-10-04T13:23:41 <Bosmon> And the use of constants just makes it harder for others to extend the system
2018-10-04T13:24:03 <Bosmon> Since they need to find out how to extend the table of constant mappings, as well as the difficulty of extending the implementation itself
2018-10-04T13:24:32 <Bosmon> Sometimes implementors add insult to injury by making the table of constant mappings constant : P
2018-10-04T13:25:02 <Justin_o> so you can\'t extend it at all
2018-10-04T13:25:19 <Bosmon> Morning there cindyli - I wondered if you had a bit of time to look at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3422 ?

2018-10-04T13:36:00 <jhernandez> didn\'t have time to test it myself
2018-10-04T13:36:22 <stegru> i had to try it

2018-10-04T13:39:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o, would you be able to take a look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/935 ?
2018-10-04T13:43:20 <georgitodorov> Hey, Bosmon, cindyli! It\'s me again :D
2018-10-04T13:43:35 <Bosmon> Hey there georgitodorov
2018-10-04T13:43:37 <Bosmon> Good to see you :)
2018-10-04T13:44:21 <georgitodorov> We have good progress with fixing the tests. We fixed the ones related to the PSP/QSS and tried our fixes both on a VM and on my native machine - they seem to pass everywhere
2018-10-04T13:44:28 <georgitodorov> There is one issue though
2018-10-04T13:45:05 <georgitodorov> At the end of our tests.js file the tests for gpii-windows and gpii-universal are queued for execution
2018-10-04T13:45:25 <georgitodorov> right now I can\'t execute either of those test groups together with our tests for the PSP/QSS
2018-10-04T13:46:26 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - what happens?
2018-10-04T13:46:39 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, cindyli: When running the `gpii-windows` tests, I get the following error: https://pastebin.com/3CKf5sVa
2018-10-04T13:47:18 <georgitodorov> In the Temp folder there is a file with a similar name but not the one that is desired
2018-10-04T13:47:29 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - that is pretty interesting
2018-10-04T13:47:46 <georgitodorov> Sorry, the above was for `gpii-universal` tests
2018-10-04T13:48:12 <Bosmon> Looks like one of stegru \'s tests
2018-10-04T13:48:42 <stegru> :(
2018-10-04T13:48:47 <Bosmon> This one in particular: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/eventLog/test/EventLogTests.js#L204
2018-10-04T13:49:03 <stegru> ah crap
2018-10-04T13:49:20 <stegru> windows doesn\'t like \':\' in the filename
2018-10-04T13:49:29 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2018-10-04T13:49:31 <Bosmon> Very good
2018-10-04T13:50:16 <Bosmon> There\'s a ready-built utility here : P
2018-10-04T13:50:17 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/journal/src/JournalIdParser.js#L103
2018-10-04T13:50:50 <Bosmon> We may as well escalate it into some utils area
2018-10-04T13:51:02 <Bosmon> Not that we seem to have one
2018-10-04T13:51:16 <Bosmon> I was always a bit proud of the fact that universal had no grab-bag "utils.js" crap : P
2018-10-04T13:53:11 <stegru> haha
2018-10-04T13:53:40 <stegru> instead there is a rat\'s nest of inter-dependent modules
2018-10-04T13:53:47 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: As for the gpii-windows tests, they do not start if run together with any of the PSP/QSS tests
2018-10-04T13:54:01 <Bosmon> stegru yes, instead there is that
2018-10-04T13:54:03 <georgitodorov> I get an EADDRINUSE ::8060 error
2018-10-04T13:54:28 <Bosmon> I guess one day Justin_o will help us write that micro-module declaration thingy that will let us at least see what depends on what
2018-10-04T13:54:58 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: But when run on their own, the tests do execute and complete successfully
2018-10-04T13:55:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so we can split infusion and other things up into little packages... one day
2018-10-04T13:57:48 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, cindyli: I have pushed all of our changes so far into our `fix/qssTests` branch
2018-10-04T13:58:22 <georgitodorov> It will be good if we can run the gpii-windows and gpii-universal tests together with ours because we may run into another unexpected issue
2018-10-04T13:58:58 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, it will

2018-10-04T14:08:40 <Justin_o> gmoss: hello
2018-10-04T14:09:16 <Justin_o> I\'m wondering if FLUID-6300 will be changing based on the discussion we had yesterday for FLUID-6312. That is moving the language to be a preference.
2018-10-04T14:12:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3422, the change for "noSettings" handler, do you think it makes sense for the "set" method to generate a block that looks like:
2018-10-04T14:12:35 <cindyli> settings: {
2018-10-04T14:12:35 <cindyli> "volume": {
2018-10-04T14:12:35 <cindyli> newValue: undefined,
2018-10-04T14:12:35 <cindyli> oldValue: undefined
2018-10-04T14:12:35 <cindyli> }
2018-10-04T14:12:36 <cindyli> }
2018-10-04T14:13:23 <cindyli> "volume" is just an example. this string is based off the settings string provided in the settingsHandler options block
2018-10-04T14:13:42 <cindyli> is it ok to use "undefined" for old and new values?

2018-10-04T14:29:29 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2018-10-04T14:29:36 <Bosmon> It just needs to be good enough to cause the rest of the system to generate an appliedSettings block
2018-10-04T14:30:34 <cindyli> well, ok. i will have a look at how an appliedSettings block is generated ;)
2018-10-04T14:33:10 <cindyli> Bosmon: a good test case should be using georgitodorov\'s fix/qssTests branch by switching back to use dynamicDevice config, right? with this fix, psp tests should pass
2018-10-04T14:33:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2018-10-04T14:33:20 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-04T14:33:42 <Bosmon> But do write one of your own of course : P
2018-10-04T14:33:55 <Bosmon> At least, you should be able to pass stegru\'s test of not generating a solution-failed message
2018-10-04T14:35:43 <cindyli> i will certainly write a unit test for "noSettings" handler. but don\'t have much idea yet about how to write a more extensive test
2018-10-04T14:36:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, it doesn\'t need to be enormously good : P
2018-10-04T14:36:25 <cindyli> haha
2018-10-04T14:36:30 <Bosmon> I\'m surprised the system didn\'t throw an exceptiono on the output of the old settingsHandler

2018-10-04T14:40:18 <jhernandez> Bosmon, cindyli, georgitodorov, dandimitrov: FYI, I\'m seeing that I don\'t get any error dialog if I try to key-in with a user that doesn\'t exist
2018-10-04T14:40:51 <jhernandez> and in the browser, from where I am triggering the key-in, I\'m getting {"isError":true,"message":"server_error while executing HTTP POST on url http://flowmanager.jhernandez.dev.gcp.gpii.net/access_token"}
2018-10-04T14:41:16 <gmoss> Justin_o: hmmm I\'m not sure it\'ll affect 6300 very much.. the localized uio component has its own model value to track locale, which we can store wherever we like. Since things aren\'t wired up anywhere except in my branch for 6312, I think we\'re in the clear. (on the subway btw, spotty reception)
2018-10-04T14:41:43 <jhernandez> but this error doesn\'t result to a dialog in gpii-app - which I would expect
2018-10-04T14:42:58 <Bosmon> jhernandez - thanks for the report - I agreed with dandimitrov that we need to fire a "userError" on the core\'s side when there is a key-in error
2018-10-04T14:43:21 <jhernandez> okay, so it\'s well known
2018-10-04T14:43:53 <cindyli> jhernandez: create a jira and assign to me
2018-10-04T14:44:11 <jhernandez> cindyli: sure, will do
2018-10-04T14:44:12 <dandimitrov> jhernandez, currently only if you use the gpii-app\xe2\x80\x99s keyIn mechanism the error dialog will be shown
2018-10-04T14:44:14 <jhernandez> thanks!!
2018-10-04T14:44:24 <jhernandez> ohh
2018-10-04T14:44:28 <Justin_o> gmoss: i wonder how the two locale would/should interact
2018-10-04T14:44:30 <jhernandez> I see
2018-10-04T14:44:34 <jhernandez> :)
2018-10-04T14:46:12 <jhernandez> Bosmon, cindyli: BTW, regarding the installer I shared earlier, it\'s using my personal gcp that have the users that we used for the feds-audit demo (and people wanted to keep around)
2018-10-04T14:46:30 <cindyli> ok. thanks, jhernandez
2018-10-04T14:46:41 <jhernandez> and I took care of avoiding any application specific highContrast settings
2018-10-04T14:46:45 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-10-04T14:47:01 <cindyli> smart
2018-10-04T14:47:02 <jhernandez> so we won\'t hit that problem in the PSP
2018-10-04T14:47:04 <jhernandez> :)
