2018-10-05T08:55:38 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I see that there is a new version of `gpii-universal`. Can you roll out a new version of `gpii-windows`, as well?
2018-10-05T08:56:24 <georgitodorov> Also, is stegru\'s test that was failing yesterday on my machine fixed in the new version of `gpii-universal`?
2018-10-05T08:57:15 <georgitodorov> And one last thing - any idea why I may be getting the "address in use" error when running both the PSP/QSS tests and the ones for `gpii-windows`?
2018-10-05T08:58:49 <stegru> georgitodorov: For your second question - no. https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/680
2018-10-05T09:01:49 <georgitodorov> stegru: I see, thanks.

2018-10-05T09:41:57 <georgitodorov> stegru: hmm, it is still not working for me. I receive again the ENOENT error. Is there anything else that I need to do?
2018-10-05T09:45:57 <georgitodorov> stegru: The file that the tests are trying to open is called "gpii-test-eventLog-0.246kvzxnwpf" but the actual file that gets created has the name "gpii-test-eventLog-0.t3vesws86zp"
2018-10-05T09:46:50 <georgitodorov> The same thing was happening when I tried running the tests with and without your initial fix - the names of the files differed
2018-10-05T09:46:57 <georgitodorov> Any ideas why this is happening?
2018-10-05T09:47:20 <stegru> oh I see - it looks like I was incorrect about the cause of the bug

2018-10-05T13:47:39 <Justin_o> I see there is a test for "*" to ensure that it matches a subcomponent. Are there tests for cases where you distribute options to a component that doesn\'t exist
2018-10-05T13:47:50 <Justin_o> e.g. {that > *} but there are no subcomponents
2018-10-05T13:48:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there can be no such tests
2018-10-05T13:48:24 <Bosmon> How could we test that a distribution doesn\'t arrive at a place that doesn\'t exist?
2018-10-05T13:48:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah.. that\'s like when i want to test that an event wasn\'t fired
2018-10-05T13:48:56 <Bosmon> You can test that an event isn\'t fired, by adding a listener to it : P
2018-10-05T13:49:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can we test that it doesn\'t break?
2018-10-05T13:49:06 <Bosmon> But you can\'t test that a distribution doesn\'t arrive at a nonexistent place
2018-10-05T13:49:10 <Justin_o> well i guess not because it will just wait
2018-10-05T13:49:29 <Justin_o> and the onCreate should still fire and etc..
2018-10-05T13:49:31 <Justin_o> okay.. never mind

2018-10-05T14:25:14 <Bosmon> Just running the tests on your pull ....

2018-10-05T14:39:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - I got that test case hang a 3rd time
2018-10-05T14:40:10 <Bosmon> We should resolve it once you don\'t have more urgent work ...
2018-10-05T14:41:31 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m finishing off https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3426, will send a pull request soon. after that i will start to work on this one
2018-10-05T14:41:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s really great

2018-10-05T14:46:51 <Bosmon> A 3rd failure
2018-10-05T14:46:58 <Bosmon> I\'ve effectively lost my ability to verify pulls : P
2018-10-05T15:07:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you try to run JournalIntegration.js in this branch: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-3396
2018-10-05T15:08:23 <cindyli> i made a change to check noUserLoggedIn event before gpii.test.checkSequence
2018-10-05T15:09:31 <cindyli> i tested in mac and windows, both looks fine. but this doesn\'t count because I never successfully reproduce the hanging problem you had ;)
2018-10-05T15:20:04 <Bosmon> OK, thanks cindyli
2018-10-05T15:20:08 <Bosmon> Sounds like a simple way out of the problem
2018-10-05T15:20:35 <cindyli> let me know if it works
2018-10-05T15:30:22 * michelled joined the channel
2018-10-05T15:31:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: i run into a problem at fixing https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3426. the solution i\'m using is to fire a userError with "keyInFailed" when a user logon request fails for any reasons, in particular at userLogonRequest.onError event - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/UserLogonRequest.js#L44
2018-10-05T15:31:45 <cindyli> but i noticed there are other places during the keyin process that a userError could be reported - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L622-L629
2018-10-05T15:32:05 <cindyli> such as when a setting is failed to apply
2018-10-05T15:32:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, the setting fails to apply is its own notification
2018-10-05T15:32:51 <cindyli> my change makes the user error is triggered twice with WriteSettingFail and keyInFail
2018-10-05T15:33:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - that sounds correct to me
2018-10-05T15:33:03 <cindyli> is this right?
2018-10-05T15:33:06 <cindyli> ah ok
2018-10-05T15:33:23 <Bosmon> Astea already implemented a system for queueing notifications of multiple failures
2018-10-05T15:33:41 <cindyli> cool. thanks. fixing ErrorTests.js then
2018-10-05T15:34:01 <cindyli> at the moment it only expects one WriteSettingFail to be reported
