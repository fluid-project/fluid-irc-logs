b'2018-02-05T20:32:12 <colinclark> redistribution isn\'t the issue
2018-02-05T20:32:29 <colinclark> it\'s the risk that code gets modified, and then not released back under the same license
2018-02-05T20:32:48 <colinclark> the way we structure our in-repository third party dependencies mitigates this
2018-02-05T20:32:58 <colinclark> with a distinct license declaration in each directoyr
2018-02-05T20:33:18 <colinclark> but the advice I\'ve had in the past is to externalize the dependency if possible
2018-02-05T20:33:30 <colinclark> worst case scenario, you create a fork and make an npm package for it
2018-02-05T20:33:36 <colinclark> but there may be other options
2018-02-05T20:33:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: that makes sense... i\'d like to be able to pull in all of our libs like this... if i have time i\'ll see what that might look like.
2018-02-05T20:33:51 <colinclark> yes
2018-02-05T20:33:53 <colinclark> that would be wonderful
2018-02-05T20:33:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: the fork is good point
2018-02-05T20:34:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks for the help, i\'ll look into that
2018-02-05T20:34:15 <colinclark> no problem
2018-02-05T20:34:17 <colinclark> let me know how it goes
2018-02-05T20:34:36 <Justin_o> will do
2018-02-05T20:34:40 <colinclark> Just to be clear, I don\'t see any benefit to Hyphenator vs. Hypher
2018-02-05T20:34:47 <colinclark> whichever works best for you seems reasonable to me
2018-02-05T20:34:56 <colinclark> and they\'re both redistributed under very liberal licenses
2018-02-05T20:35:15 <colinclark> MIT in the former case and 3-BSD in the latter
2018-02-05T20:39:01 <Justin_o> thanks.. i have a test page for comparing hypher to nlp-syllables https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/infusion/FLUID-6240-syllables/demos/syllables/index.html maybe i\'ll experiment with hyphenator a bit and see how it stacks up. It\'s a bit strange that hypher isn\'t actually for breaking things into syllables, but still does a better job than nlp-syllables
2018-02-05T20:45:04 <colinclark> cool
2018-02-05T20:45:28 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I think a part of that is that the problem of text hyphenation is pretty closely related and has had a lot more theoretical work done by some very smart people in building algorithms that work for automatically laying out English text
2018-02-05T20:46:10 <alanharnum> the Liang hyphenation algorithm from \'93 still seems to be the state-of-the-art, at least for English
2018-02-05T20:46:25 <alanharnum> sorry, 83, not 93
2018-02-05T20:50:06 <alanharnum> i also have the sense that the inconsistency of the English language plus regional variation in pronunciation (just in UK vs. NA, much less different regions in each) means that to achieve close to 100% accuracy you need some kind of individual pronouncing dictionary. if you\'re just doing it algorithmically the success rate seems around 85-90% because there\'s so many outliers
2018-02-05T20:51:33 <ussjoin> alanharnum: does LaTeX have any more-current research built into its hyphenator? (I know I have had to teach it words on occasion, so maybe not.)
2018-02-05T20:52:54 <alanharnum> ussjoin: no clue - I\'m not speaking from any area of expertise beyond "have read a few stack overflow threads on the problems of hyphenation / syllabification"
2018-02-05T20:53:09 <ussjoin> Heh, KK. Not like I have a clue either, so I\'ll show myself back out. :-)

2018-02-05T20:55:43 <alanharnum> ussjoin: it sounds, from reading http://www.tex.ac.uk/FAQ-hyphen.html, that the Liang algorithm continues to be the core
2018-02-05T20:56:26 <ussjoin> Heh. Nice for Dr. Liang---it\'s cool to be the state of the art for > 30 years.
2018-02-05T20:57:21 <ussjoin> Holy crap, he was *advised by Knuth himself*.
2018-02-05T20:58:17 <ussjoin> http://tug.org/docs/liang/liang-thesis.pdf -- this also refers to TAOCP as a "seven-volume series of books," which is... more than we have so far.

2018-02-05T21:13:15 <ussjoin> Heh; I don\'t know enough about Proust to evaluate that claim. I can say he\'s a sweet enough person, though.
2018-02-05T21:14:53 <ussjoin> Oh, I see (thanks, wiki!). Seven volumes, died before finishing... yeah, seems like a good analogy mrtyler.

2018-02-05T15:17:51 <cindyli> mrtyler: r u there?
2018-02-05T15:20:09 <mrtyler> hi cindyli
2018-02-05T15:23:14 <cindyli> hey, mrtyler, thanks for the email with all details of using gpii-infra. i certainly will need more help from you later on with the process. one thing to clarify for now is that, when you say "In CI testing, this will point to the cluster created by the CI process, http://flowmanager.dev-gitlab-runner.gpii.net/", do you mean when pull requests are issued against the universal master and trigger the CI process, they should all point t
2018-02-05T15:23:14 <cindyli> o http://flowmanager.dev-gitlab-runner.gpii.net/
2018-02-05T15:23:38 <cindyli> and this cluster will be redeployed based on the code from each pull request?
2018-02-05T15:24:08 <mrtyler> i realized over the weekend it\'s a little more complex than that
2018-02-05T15:24:35 <mrtyler> dev-gitlab-runner is spun up (and destroyed) by the CI process for the gpii-infra repo
2018-02-05T15:25:00 <mrtyler> i think the way it will work is that CI for the universal repo itself will *not* run tests that require cloud-based components
2018-02-05T15:25:16 <mrtyler> and instead we\'ll run those tests as part of CI for the gpii-infra repo
2018-02-05T15:25:34 <mrtyler> because that is the only way to guarantee that the right version of the code is available in a CBFM
2018-02-05T15:25:44 <mrtyler> however, we can discuss alternatives
2018-02-05T15:26:28 <mrtyler> lmk if that makes sense
2018-02-05T15:26:55 <mrtyler> also if you have a few minutes, we can set up your AWS account now
2018-02-05T15:27:45 <cindyli> that would be great. also, later when you have time, or when we chat, can you clarify "run those tests as part of CI for the gpii-infra repo"? thanks
2018-02-05T15:28:08 <mrtyler> cindyli: ok, give me a minute to set up and i\'ll call you on skype?
2018-02-05T15:28:14 <cindyli> sure
2018-02-05T15:28:15 <mrtyler> er, what is your skype id? :)

2018-02-05T16:50:56 <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, I will let you know this afternoon

2018-02-05T18:22:50 <Bosmon> oh wow
2018-02-05T18:23:09 <simonjb> I wanted to check if you were interested in joining and if you were able to join this week?
2018-02-05T18:23:31 <Bosmon> Sure, yes, although I\'d have a bit more time if it were next week

2018-02-05T18:31:32 <simonjb> ok, thanks Bosmon

2018-02-05T18:40:26 <Bosmon> ok
2018-02-05T18:40:37 <simonjb> I hope that works for you
2018-02-05T18:41:05 <simonjb> we will swap this week and next week

2018-02-05T18:52:53 <Bosmon> simonjb - I was thinking of trying to have a section on the various varieties of the "DynamicComponentIndexer"
2018-02-05T18:53:13 <Bosmon> Which I guess constitute a form of "pattern" that\'s been reproduced numerous times, in the absence of a dedicated framework feature to support this
2018-02-05T18:53:19 <Bosmon> I think we have 3 or 4 varieties of it by now
2018-02-05T18:53:35 <Bosmon> How much material do you have for the session already?
2018-02-05T18:55:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: let me send you my slides so far -- it\'s going to be mostly general introduction to Pattern Languages I think, with detailed Infusion stuff at the end
2018-02-05T18:55:38 <simonjb> and probably fairly high level
2018-02-05T18:55:40 <simonjb> I think
2018-02-05T18:56:09 <simonjb> technical discussion may be another meeting
2018-02-05T18:56:25 <simonjb> but we\'ll see how it goes

2018-02-05T20:17:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: license question... I\'m looking at https://github.com/bramstein/hypher for splitting up words into syllables. It requires patterns to be able to know how to split up words from a given localization. https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns
2018-02-05T20:18:21 <Justin_o> These patterns are LGPL, unless otherwise noted. Do you think that would be an issue to include in Infusion?
2018-02-05T20:19:20 * amatas_ has quit
2018-02-05T20:20:07 <colinclark> i\'m just having a look
2018-02-05T20:23:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2018-02-05T20:23:40 <colinclark> There are a few mysteries here
2018-02-05T20:24:33 <colinclark> In general, LPGL is fine to use, but we need to be quite careful to know when we\'ve modified LGPL code\xe2\x80\x94so in general, the approach is to try to always refer to such code as an external module, like for example an NPM module.
2018-02-05T20:25:14 <colinclark> LGPL is not "viral" as GPL code, in that linking to it does not automatically require the linking application to distribute their souce code as GPL
2018-02-05T20:25:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: sadly this repo isn\'t setup as a package
2018-02-05T20:25:30 <colinclark> but it does mean that the code itself still must be shared back
2018-02-05T20:25:48 <colinclark> the thing that is puzzling is the actual source of the patterns
2018-02-05T20:25:57 <colinclark> all of which seem to come from a library called Hyphenator
2018-02-05T20:26:22 <colinclark> and which is is in fact licensed under an MIT license
2018-02-05T20:26:54 <colinclark> https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator
2018-02-05T20:27:25 <colinclark> some patterns are LGPL, others are not
2018-02-05T20:27:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks looking at that... hypher actually links to that in it\'s readme.. not sure why the patterns don\'t
2018-02-05T20:27:41 <colinclark> well, because they\'re old :)
2018-02-05T20:27:57 <colinclark> even Hyphenator refers to its own Google Code repository ins pots
2018-02-05T20:27:59 <colinclark> spots
2018-02-05T20:28:16 <colinclark> MIT is liberal enough that you can re-license the code as LGPL, so it may be that the other of the library you linked to wanted to keep things simple
2018-02-05T20:28:37 <colinclark> anyway, the point is that we should not import LGPL licensed code into our repo\xe2\x80\x94we should refer to them by some other method
2018-02-05T20:30:00 <grrrero> michelled: Just gotta clean up my code & do the same refactoring for the registration of the other widgets on the page -- cindyli says other than that it looks good :D
2018-02-05T20:31:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay so i think i should just grab the patterns from hyphenator and see if they work, and/or just use hyphenator itself.
2018-02-05T20:31:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: if we pull in through npm and copy it with a grunt build, is that safe for lgpl patterns, or should we just exclude those ones?
2018-02-05T20:32:03 <colinclark> that should be fine
