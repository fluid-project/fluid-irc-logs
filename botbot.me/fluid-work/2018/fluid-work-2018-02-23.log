2018-02-23T14:01:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, crud.  Glad I checked, there are errors running node-gyp in the Vagrant VM.
2018-02-23T14:03:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Seems like the newer version of microsoft-build-tools is based on VS2017, which seems not to be compatible.
2018-02-23T14:04:22 <the-t-in-rtf> it will take some time to find the right combination of older versions of things.

2018-02-23T14:20:51 <stegru> jhernandez: I\'m pushing a fix to my gpii-wix repo (your pilot branch points to that). It\'s a very shit fix for the high-contrast, because I don\'t think i have time for a decent one
2018-02-23T14:21:23 <jhernandez> stegru: okay
2018-02-23T14:21:23 <stegru> it just adds in start.cmd "sethc 11" before gpii gets loaded
2018-02-23T14:21:43 <stegru> so the high-contrast returns after a restart
2018-02-23T14:22:17 <jhernandez> that\'s great, even though you had to apply a shitty fix
2018-02-23T14:22:39 <jhernandez> I\'m still dealing with the electron update
2018-02-23T14:22:49 <jhernandez> yesterday night I had it working
2018-02-23T14:23:16 <jhernandez> this morning, wiped out the vm, started from scratch and .... tests are not passing anymore

2018-02-23T14:41:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, couldn\'t find one that worked.
2018-02-23T14:42:09 <the-t-in-rtf> The defaults fail because it wants version "2.0"
2018-02-23T14:42:12 <alanharnum> michelled: let\'s try this afternoon sometime?
2018-02-23T14:42:22 <michelled> sounds good

2018-02-23T14:47:53 <jhernandez> stegru: nothing that I can think of, thanks
2018-02-23T14:48:01 <jhernandez> I\'m like the-t-in-rtf, doing some juggling to find the right combination of things to get it working
2018-02-23T14:49:08 <jhernandez> in any case, I\'m having a rest right now
2018-02-23T14:49:15 <jhernandez> I\'m about to leave with the dogs for a walk
2018-02-23T14:49:20 <the-t-in-rtf> If I set it to 2013, 2015, 2017, it complains about not having a different version.  It claims to only have "4.0" and "14.0".
2018-02-23T14:49:20 <Bosmon> DOGES!
2018-02-23T14:52:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I think this may have been a hidden cost of starting to run on node@8
2018-02-23T14:52:56 <the-t-in-rtf> and versions being ticked forward on the microsoft-build-tools chocolatey package.

2018-02-23T15:04:11 <Bosmon> But I guess we\'d better wait for jhernandez
2018-02-23T15:04:17 <Bosmon> Since he\'s pretty crucial to the material

2018-02-23T16:02:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Interesting, it turns out the build issues only happen when trying to build node-inspector, which I only include as a courtesy.
2018-02-23T16:03:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Although eventually it would be good to figure things out, everything else works with the "vcbuildtools" chocolatey package and "msvs_version" set to "2015"
2018-02-23T16:03:11 <ussjoin> For those of you with iOS devices: Apple is featuring assistive software in the App Store today, including a feature story on the person who created Proloquo2Go, and Keystrokes for Mac.
2018-02-23T16:04:56 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, iOS.
2018-02-23T16:05:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I got excited and went to the Mac App Store.
2018-02-23T16:05:06 <the-t-in-rtf> :|
2018-02-23T16:05:23 <ussjoin> This is iOS, in the iOS 11 much more in-depth featured app world.
2018-02-23T16:05:35 <ussjoin> I can screenshot the article, if you\'d like.
2018-02-23T16:07:09 <ussjoin> My thought was less "oh, the people hanging out in #fluid-work will never have heard of any of this," and much more "this is a neat feature for a lot of people who won\'t know about this entire *world* to learn about it."
2018-02-23T16:07:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, please, I am curious about that ecosystem, but don\'t have an iOS device.
2018-02-23T16:08:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I was reading the OS docs themselves, did they just add switch support?
2018-02-23T16:09:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, iOS 7, apparently.
2018-02-23T16:09:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like both Android and iOS added it in 2014.
2018-02-23T16:11:05 <ussjoin> the-t-in-rtf: "Switch support?"
2018-02-23T16:11:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @Bosmon and others, with that little goof out of the way, I\'ll have an updated release of gpii-pouchdb ready after I finish a full run of the Vagrant tests.
2018-02-23T16:11:31 <the-t-in-rtf> like a toggle control you use to navigate up/down.
2018-02-23T16:11:38 <ussjoin> Ah, gotcha.
2018-02-23T16:11:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Some are "pause to click", let me find an example.

2018-02-23T16:14:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Interesting to read more about proloquo, I read a lot about it when developing something similar for Android.
2018-02-23T16:14:38 <the-t-in-rtf> gosh, the pricing.
2018-02-23T16:15:02 <ussjoin> Yeah, the pricing is expensive, but I am told that it compares ridiculously favorably with all-hardware solutions?
2018-02-23T16:15:15 <ussjoin> (It makes it really hard to *try* stuff, though, which is a deep downside.)
2018-02-23T16:15:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, those are thousands.
2018-02-23T16:15:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I did a lot of research into the field.
2018-02-23T16:16:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I guess people routinely blow as much to goof around with Logic Pro and other tools.
2018-02-23T16:16:33 * vdego_ has quit
2018-02-23T16:18:48 <ussjoin> That\'s true, though I have somewhat less sympathy for people of means buying prosumer tools than I do for people who may be financially struggling who need to put together the money to buy AT.
2018-02-23T16:19:29 <ussjoin> (I mean, if *I* buy, say, Logic Pro, or (like last year) Adobe CC in the "gimme everything" package, it\'s because I can and want to; I\'m not going to be stifled without it.)
2018-02-23T16:19:44 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I\'m back
2018-02-23T16:20:01 <ussjoin> (Also I am annoyed there\'s no package that combines Illustrator and Photoshop without just paying the price for everything in the suite, but that\'s a whole other problem. :-) )
2018-02-23T16:23:58 * kavya joined the channel
2018-02-23T16:32:41 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a fair point, I assume in at least some cases the pricing is targeted towards insurance.
2018-02-23T16:36:03 <the-t-in-rtf> But you\'re totally right, that\'s why I made mine free and open source.
2018-02-23T16:36:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to compete with markers and poster board, which some of my Aunt\'s clients have to use to create their picture boards.
2018-02-23T16:37:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess with the device cost, it\'s still cheaper than a dedicated device, as you say.
2018-02-23T16:37:40 <the-t-in-rtf> but it\'s still a reach for a lot of people.
2018-02-23T16:38:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Even the software used to create board sets for dedicated devices is expensive for therapists.
2018-02-23T16:39:32 <ussjoin> *nods*
2018-02-23T16:40:53 <ussjoin> It\'s hard, though; my guess is that to get the experts in to help design *effective* solutions costs quite a bit, and the markets are necessarily small, which means the per-unit costs are going to be high. You\'re able to provide an OSS solution because you\'re a subject-matter expert and you want to, but most companies don\'t have in-house SMEs willing to do the work out of their wish to improve society.
2018-02-23T16:41:41 <ussjoin> (And designing without SMEs is, of course, a path to the standard SV path of "let\'s build something that fundamentally misunderstands our clients\' needs!")

2018-02-23T16:42:47 <Bosmon> You can consult the notes if you are interested
2018-02-23T16:42:53 <jhernandez> okay, cool
2018-02-23T16:43:27 * stegru has quit
2018-02-23T16:43:49 <jhernandez> right now I\'m building a new installer for the pilots
2018-02-23T16:43:57 <Bosmon> great
2018-02-23T16:45:51 * yuriy has quit
2018-02-23T16:45:58 <jhernandez> wrt the update of electron, I\'m sorry to say that I won\'t have a lot of time to keep working on it after 7pm - maybe late at night when I\'m back, but can\'t promise anything
2018-02-23T16:46:18 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-02-23T16:46:22 <jhernandez> so, yesterday night I had it working, with tests passing
2018-02-23T16:46:35 <jhernandez> I updated and pushed gpii-windows
2018-02-23T16:48:09 <jhernandez> this morning, I did the accommodations in gpii-app to use that gpii-windows branch, ran the build process from scratch before pushing, but the tests weren\'t passing
2018-02-23T16:48:45 <jhernandez> the most annoying thing is the awaiting periods during the npm install process
2018-02-23T16:48:49 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-02-23T16:48:55 <Bosmon> It is quite astoundingly slow
2018-02-23T16:48:57 <Bosmon> Especially in a VM
2018-02-23T16:48:59 * alanharnum has quit
2018-02-23T16:49:14 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, gpii-pouchdb 1.0.10 is out.
2018-02-23T16:50:02 <jhernandez> yes, but we have to live with that
2018-02-23T16:52:55 <jhernandez> Bosmon: btw, here\'s the error I\'m facing now https://pastebin.com/fcVk2ejJ
2018-02-23T16:54:00 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: great, yesterday we had to update to 1.0.9, but I guess that we better update to that new one, isn\'t it?
2018-02-23T16:54:19 <Bosmon> jhernandez - sure, but only if it causing problems
2018-02-23T16:54:31 <Bosmon> Looks like the new pilot installer is the critical path right now
2018-02-23T16:54:35 <jhernandez> yes
2018-02-23T16:54:37 <jhernandez> sure
2018-02-23T16:54:39 <jhernandez> I\'m on it
2018-02-23T16:54:43 <Bosmon> So if something isn\'t blocking that I guess it can be pushed out for a while
2018-02-23T16:55:06 <Bosmon> I made an attempt to update node-ffi and ref in gpii-windows but it failed

2018-02-23T17:01:06 <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez, @Bosmon suggested 1.0.9 might have a "new enough" version of infusion, but if you can, yes, 1.10.0 is the better option.

2018-02-23T17:01:38 <jhernandez> yes, I saw it, any idea of why? probably we need a recent version of node before upgrading these two?

2018-02-23T08:55:05 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hello, Antranig! I grabbed the versions of windows and infusion from your pending PR and checked locally if the tests are passing now.
2018-02-23T08:55:09 <georgitodorov> And they are!!!
2018-02-23T08:55:36 <georgitodorov> Once you merge your PR, I will update the GPII-2732 branch and it can go into master, as well.
2018-02-23T08:56:12 <georgitodorov> Afterwards, we will open a new PR for the work related to the (sequential) error dialogs which includes some CSS and code refactoring.

2018-02-23T09:31:26 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I merged master into GPII-2732. I think this PR is now ready to go in
2018-02-23T09:32:00 <georgitodorov> Maybe someone needs to configure the CI - I see that for other PRs this has been done.

2018-02-23T11:03:38 <jhernandez> Bosmon: bonjour
2018-02-23T11:04:04 <jhernandez> npm 8 is almost there
2018-02-23T11:05:13 <jhernandez> yesterday night was long, the edge stuff has been hard to accommodate, both in windows and gpii-app
2018-02-23T11:06:17 * aditya_ has left the channel
2018-02-23T11:06:57 * aditya_ joined the channel
2018-02-23T11:07:50 <jhernandez> windows is ok and I\'m finishing with gpii-app
2018-02-23T11:08:31 <jhernandez> s/npm/node
2018-02-23T11:09:06 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The build failed because "Survey dialog has correct dimensions" test did not pass
2018-02-23T11:09:23 <georgitodorov> The expected height was 700 but the actual was 574
2018-02-23T11:10:02 <georgitodorov> I guess whether this has anything to do with the machine on which tests are run and its display settings
2018-02-23T11:10:39 <georgitodorov> We saw that error on the call on Monday, as well (in the pastebin that jhernandez provided)
2018-02-23T11:13:51 <georgitodorov> I guess --> I am wondering
2018-02-23T11:14:00 * aditya_ has quit
2018-02-23T11:14:12 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: hm, still getting that problem :/
2018-02-23T11:14:47 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: But, of course, locally everything is fine...
2018-02-23T11:15:04 <jhernandez> we\'re updating no node 8/electron 1.8
2018-02-23T11:15:31 <jhernandez> and should be ready by today
2018-02-23T11:16:35 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: let\'s see whether the problem remains after the update

2018-02-23T11:28:01 <Bosmon> jhernandez, georgitodorov - I think this might be related to a problem we\'ve had before
2018-02-23T11:28:13 <Bosmon> That the vagrant box may put up a licence dialog which disturbs the screen layout?
2018-02-23T11:28:43 * aditya_96 joined the channel
2018-02-23T11:28:45 <Bosmon> jhernandez - thanks for the excellent work on the update
2018-02-23T11:29:40 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: This sounds like a plausible explanation
2018-02-23T11:29:52 <georgitodorov> In this case shall I simply remove this test?
2018-02-23T11:30:25 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - or replace it with a weaker test that just tests the width, or so ....
2018-02-23T11:30:29 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru , is skype working for you?
2018-02-23T11:30:39 <stegru> yeh, javjarfer[m]
2018-02-23T11:30:55 <stegru> well, it\'s running
2018-02-23T11:31:11 <stegru> echo works
2018-02-23T11:31:13 <javjarfer[m]> mmm weird, my messages are not reaching you
2018-02-23T11:31:32 <stegru> they\'re not
2018-02-23T11:31:39 <javjarfer[m]> okay, I can see you, but messages says \'sending\'
2018-02-23T11:31:47 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: okay, I will do that and add a comment to let the reader why we are not testing the height :)
2018-02-23T11:31:56 <jhernandez> stegru: do you know about JJ, is he alive?

2018-02-23T11:33:33 <javjarfer[m]> nice, now again, things are breaking weirdly lately
2018-02-23T11:34:21 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: this is weird, can see your messages but you cant see mine
2018-02-23T11:35:58 <jhernandez> Bosmon, georgitodorov: I\'ll re-test the survey tests once I\'m done with the upgrade of electron, but yeah, if it keeps failing, I would see if that happens outside of our vagrant box
2018-02-23T11:37:35 <jhernandez> but yeah, if the dimensions of the survey window is susceptible to change among different displays, then we need to do "weaker" test as Bosmon suggested
2018-02-23T11:39:50 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, jhernandez: I changed the test to a weaker version. I hope that the build will be fine now. If any of you can trigger it, I\'ll be very thankful (I don\'t know if this is something automatic).
2018-02-23T11:40:28 <georgitodorov> Oh, it started. Ignore my request :)

2018-02-23T13:14:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon (or anyone else really), I wanted to see where the discussion about bumping infusion versions in the packages I maintain got to.  I can probably expedite 1-2 today, I just need to know which (if any) are blocking, which (if any) have already been done.
2018-02-23T13:16:07 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I think that none are blocking any more
2018-02-23T13:16:17 <Bosmon> It turned out that the version of gpii-pouchdb we had to hand was recent enough
2018-02-23T13:16:20 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2018-02-23T13:16:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, thanks.
2018-02-23T13:16:44 <Bosmon> But I think that is the one of your ecosystem that pulls in the stalest version of Infusion
2018-02-23T13:16:47 <Bosmon> From early November
2018-02-23T13:17:06 <the-t-in-rtf> I can still update it if it\'s just that one, just don\'t quite have time for a full pass through.
2018-02-23T13:17:12 <the-t-in-rtf> You mentioned gpii-express, did you do that one?
2018-02-23T13:17:29 <Bosmon> I didn\'t, but that one is bound a few weeks later
2018-02-23T13:17:46 <Bosmon> If you do make a pass, it would be best to start there since gpii-pouch\'s dependencies are conditioned by its gpii-express
2018-02-23T13:18:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-02-23T13:31:39 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I have a checklist in the right order that I work through.
2018-02-23T13:33:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Thankfully those two are on the edge of the woods.  No panthers/leopards, she-wolves, or lions.
2018-02-23T13:33:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Or dead poets.
2018-02-23T13:37:15 <the-t-in-rtf> So.  gpii-express already has an open pull.
2018-02-23T13:37:22 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express/pull/37
2018-02-23T13:37:37 <the-t-in-rtf> It is utterly trivial and well-tested, I can self-merge if you\'re OK with my including that in this.
2018-02-23T13:38:19 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s just a new piece of middleware to let you list directory contents, and it\'s not wired into anything by default.
2018-02-23T13:38:38 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2018-02-23T13:39:58 <Bosmon> Yes, this is ok to go in, although I see your package.json got reformatted again
2018-02-23T13:41:33 <the-t-in-rtf> OH, I\'ll fix that while I\'m there, thanks.

2018-02-23T13:51:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Blessedly there is no gpii-pouchdb pull to block anything.  I\'m assuming we\'re OK with just commit messages and release notes for this?

2018-02-23T13:52:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, gpii-express 1.0.13 is already available.
2018-02-23T13:53:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Already tested the changes to gpii-pouchdb, I can cut a release either way, just let me know.
