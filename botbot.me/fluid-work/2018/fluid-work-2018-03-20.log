2018-03-20T13:34:46 <stegru> morning clown.. not urgent, but I\'d love for you to have a quick look through a PR where I\'ve used the process reporter, and just check I\'m using it the right way (it does work): https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/169
2018-03-20T13:35:38 <stegru> oh I\'ve also tweaked it to ignore case when matching process names under windows
2018-03-20T13:36:11 <stegru> but there\'s no rush for this
