2018-05-20T18:03:27 <sgithens> Bosmon: Cheers, it looks like even in that  function you have to refresh the view after you destroy all of them.  For now I may need to bake in a thing that removes it from the dom... or maybe I'm just doing it wrong and need to check with the-t-in-rtf
2018-05-20T18:07:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Not sure how much I can help, I tend more towards redrawing on changes rather than recreating, but happy to chat through it (on Tuesday once the long weekend is over).
2018-05-20T18:07:36 <the-t-in-rtf> We still have a full day of speaking in tongues here.
