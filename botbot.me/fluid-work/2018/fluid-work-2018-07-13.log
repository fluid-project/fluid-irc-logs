b'2018-07-13T13:52:22 <cindyli> dandimitrov: in the real production environment, the cloud based flow manager will not start locally
2018-07-13T13:52:31 <cindyli> i guess there are 2 options to solve this:
2018-07-13T13:52:43 <dandimitrov> a more specific selector?
2018-07-13T13:52:53 <cindyli> 1. link the start of gpii-app with local flow manager rather than cloud based flow manager
2018-07-13T13:53:03 <cindyli> right, as you\'ve said
2018-07-13T13:53:04 <dandimitrov> gpii.flowManager.untrusted will probably work?
2018-07-13T13:53:32 <cindyli> gpii.flowManager.local would work better for both all-in-local and untrusted configs
2018-07-13T13:54:51 <dandimitrov> Oh, yes
2018-07-13T13:54:58 * colinclark has quit
2018-07-13T13:55:10 <dandimitrov> It works like a charm
2018-07-13T13:55:17 <dandimitrov> Great, thank you again :)
2018-07-13T13:55:23 <cindyli> the other option i was going to mention is to start CBFM in VM instead of your host machine
2018-07-13T13:55:31 <cindyli> CHEER!

2018-07-13T14:01:30 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, everything seems to be working correctly (setting changes from the PSP are persisted) with the config cindyli provided so is there anything else we should test on our end regarding this topic?
2018-07-13T14:02:40 <dandimitrov> cindyli: And one last thing - is there a way to reset the pouchdb database in order to revert all changes made to preferences?
2018-07-13T14:06:04 <cindyli> dandimitrov: starts gpii servers and open a browser to access this url: http://localhost:8060/reset-pouch
2018-07-13T14:06:30 <cindyli> of course, using curl with this url is fine too
2018-07-13T14:07:12 <cindyli> this url will wipe out data in pouchdb and reload the initial test data
2018-07-13T14:08:03 <cindyli> here\'s the doc for it - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/PouchManager.md#get-reset-pouch

2018-07-13T15:37:54 <jhernandez> cindyli: I have just created a config that uses the dynamic device reporter
2018-07-13T15:37:57 <jhernandez> FYI
2018-07-13T15:39:43 <jhernandez> I only created the config for the untrusted one, so, do you want me to also create one to use the cloud AND the dynamic device reporter?
2018-07-13T15:41:15 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-07-13T15:42:45 <jhernandez> btw, cindyli, is there any jira issue related to creation of these configs?
2018-07-13T15:45:33 <cindyli> jhernandez: do we need to have a config using cloud + dynamic device reporter? doesn\'t device reporter only make sense using with local flow manager?
2018-07-13T15:45:55 <cindyli> jhernandez: i don\'t think we have a jira for creating these configs
2018-07-13T15:46:31 <jhernandez> well, no, I mean, I thought the plan was to use the dynamic device reporter AND the cloud
2018-07-13T15:46:48 <cindyli> ok
2018-07-13T15:47:35 <jhernandez> for a closed deployment we can be just fine with the static one, but I\'m not sure whether the decoupling of the local and remote components is a problem for this
2018-07-13T15:48:24 <cindyli> when is the dynamic device reporter needed? wonder if it can be included as a default with gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local
2018-07-13T15:48:25 <jhernandez> I mean, my guess is that yes, we might want using the dynamic device reporter and the cloud
2018-07-13T15:49:22 <jhernandez> when? well, the dynamic device reporter is capable of reporting the solutions that are available on the device
2018-07-13T15:49:44 <cindyli> sorry about my lack of knowledge on device reporter. what\'s the difference btw static and dynamic? is the static reading from a static file while the dynamic detects from the real OS?
2018-07-13T15:49:49 <jhernandez> no problem
2018-07-13T15:50:47 <jhernandez> static DR reports as installed all the solutions included in testData/deviceReporter/installedSolutions.json
2018-07-13T15:51:27 <jhernandez> the dynamic DR currently runs native code in order to guess what are the solutions available in the running system and report them as installed
2018-07-13T15:51:28 <cindyli> i see, so we still need the static for testing purpose, while the dynamic is only for production?
2018-07-13T15:51:34 <jhernandez> yup\\
2018-07-13T15:52:06 <cindyli> that means we need 2 separate configs, one for the dev, one for the production
2018-07-13T15:52:19 <jhernandez> I\'d say so
2018-07-13T15:52:41 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2018-07-13T15:52:47 <jhernandez> in my mind, we put 3 configs in gpii-app
2018-07-13T15:52:58 <cindyli> but with the production config, cloud would never run together with the local flow manager, so i\'d say we don\'t need a production config for cloud + dynamic DR
2018-07-13T15:52:59 <jhernandez> dev, testing and production
2018-07-13T15:53:29 <jhernandez> dev, to me, should use all local, which is what ASTEA team does AFAIK
2018-07-13T15:54:04 <jhernandez> testing is the "default" config, this is, it\'s the config that uses all local and the dynamic DR
2018-07-13T15:54:24 <cindyli> for the gpii-app development testing with dynamic DR, the cloud can be start separately using gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local
2018-07-13T15:54:25 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-07-13T15:54:39 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-07-13T15:54:50 <jhernandez> production, right now it doesn\'t make sense, but is there for being the config to use when creating installers, that use the production cloud and the dynamic DR
2018-07-13T15:55:09 <jhernandez> ok
2018-07-13T15:55:50 <jhernandez> then the production config would be the same as testing, but it includes the URL to the cloud?
2018-07-13T15:55:58 <cindyli> yes
2018-07-13T15:56:35 <jhernandez> ok, then we\'re in the same page
2018-07-13T15:56:42 <jhernandez> :)
2018-07-13T15:56:58 <cindyli> yah, thanks for the explanation, jhernandez
2018-07-13T16:00:47 <jhernandez> okay, I will create a jira issue and produce a pr
2018-07-13T16:01:02 <jhernandez> cindyli: sorry, what was the current CLOUD_URL that I should provide?
2018-07-13T16:01:50 <cindyli> if the cloud runs using gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local, would be http://localhost:8081
2018-07-13T16:02:12 <cindyli> if the cloud runs using the universal VM, would be http://localhost:9081
2018-07-13T16:02:22 <cindyli> just different ports
2018-07-13T16:02:43 <cindyli> i would recommend the VM to avoid the port conflict
2018-07-13T16:06:33 <jhernandez> okay, and then, if I just want to pull the prefs from the cloud, can I just use the real production url? this is, flowmanager.gpii.net or the like?
2018-07-13T16:06:51 <jhernandez> or we\'re not ready for that yet?
2018-07-13T16:06:55 <jhernandez> cindyli: ^
2018-07-13T16:09:04 <cindyli> jhernandez: i gave the wrong prod url last time, as per mrtyler pointed out, it should be https://flowmanager.prd.gpii.net/
2018-07-13T16:09:15 <cindyli> mrtyler: correct me if i\'m wrong again
2018-07-13T16:09:27 <mrtyler> nope, that\'s the right one :)
2018-07-13T16:09:46 <cindyli> thanks, mrtyler.
2018-07-13T16:09:49 <jhernandez> okay, great
2018-07-13T16:09:52 <cindyli> jhernandez: production prefs server is https://preferences.prd.gpii.net/preferences/carla
2018-07-13T16:09:58 <jhernandez> thanks to you both mrtyler and cindyli
2018-07-13T16:10:06 <cindyli> :)

2018-07-13T09:19:48 <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon. I\'m not familiar with the cloud persistence process so I have a few questions regarding Cindy\xe2\x80\x99s PR:
2018-07-13T09:19:48 <dandimitrov> * From what I understood from the discussion on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s we can use a remote cloud flow manager. Is this correct?
2018-07-13T09:19:49 <dandimitrov> * How do we know that we are connected to the cloud? What configuration are we supposed to use (probably https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1990/gpii/configs/gpii.config.cloudBased.development.json5)?
2018-07-13T09:19:57 <dandimitrov> * How do we check for changes in the cloud? Should we remotely connect to the CoachDB there? Or are changes loaded on subsequent key-ins?
2018-07-13T09:19:58 <dandimitrov> Are you available for a short call today to discuss that topic?
2018-07-13T09:51:15 <Bosmon> Hey there dandimitrov - yes I can talk in a bit
2018-07-13T09:51:24 <Bosmon> Did you manage to sort out your test case issues from yesterday?
2018-07-13T09:51:39 <Bosmon> The short answer is we have currently not implemented the cloud endpoint that would allow you to check for changes
2018-07-13T09:53:17 <dandimitrov> Yes, the tests should be working now
2018-07-13T09:53:47 <Bosmon> Oh brilliant, well done
2018-07-13T09:53:57 <Bosmon> What was the name of the event that was corrupted, and what was the cause?
2018-07-13T09:54:27 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: But the build is failing again and I don\'t think that this has to do with our code this time :)
2018-07-13T09:54:42 <georgitodorov> The event was onQssNotificationHeightChanged
2018-07-13T09:55:09 <georgitodorov> The cause was that the listener for that event was not deregistered correctly
2018-07-13T09:57:36 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I guess we can meet in Skype when you are ready

2018-07-13T12:58:19 <Bosmon> jhernandez yes
2018-07-13T12:59:40 <Bosmon> Cheers for the pull jhernandez now merged!
2018-07-13T13:00:07 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I\'ve rolled a fresh release of gpii-windows at 0.3.0-dev.20180713T125916Z.3aecce7 which now automatically builds the test-window.exe on install
2018-07-13T13:00:41 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I think you may have to remove some corresponding material from the gpii-app install process which will now no longer be necessary

2018-07-13T13:01:54 <Bosmon> cindyli - dandimitrov__ and georgitodorov were needing some help picking an appropriate config
2018-07-13T13:02:00 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I never familiarized myself with this process
2018-07-13T13:02:31 <georgitodorov> I guess jhernandez has a better idea of what needs to be removed?
2018-07-13T13:03:13 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - he does, yes - jhernandez, could you help them out with fixing up the provisioning scripts for gpii-app with respect to the GPII-2884 merge?
2018-07-13T13:04:09 <cindyli> georgitodorov, dandimitrov__, is it the same config we talked a couple of days ago with jhernandez about untrusted + dynamic device reporter?
2018-07-13T13:05:05 <jhernandez> cindyli: no, at this moment is related to the provisioning scripts
2018-07-13T13:05:09 <jhernandez> I guess we\'re not there yet
2018-07-13T13:05:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - if you scroll up in the IRC logs you will see them starting to ask their question

2018-07-13T13:05:20 <jhernandez> (in the config files)
2018-07-13T13:05:49 <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks for the merge, I\'m updating gpii-app/40 now
2018-07-13T13:05:50 <Bosmon> They want to start up a configuration of the GPII with an untrusted local flowmanager, locally hosted CBFM and pouch persistence
2018-07-13T13:06:02 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-07-13T13:06:39 <Bosmon> They tried using gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local.json5 as their base grade for this
2018-07-13T13:06:42 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: gpii-app/40 is what you will need to pull into your branch
2018-07-13T13:06:48 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-07-13T13:06:50 <jhernandez> I\'m updating it now
2018-07-13T13:06:56 <Bosmon> But got an error "Kettle server getDispatcher found no matching handlers, continuing"
2018-07-13T13:07:27 <Bosmon> Oddly I see that there are no references to gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local anywhere in the codebase except in Configs.md
2018-07-13T13:07:32 <Bosmon> So I wonder if this is actually tested?
2018-07-13T13:08:29 <jhernandez> Bosmon: shall we roll up a dev release of windows?
2018-07-13T13:10:08 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I just did
2018-07-13T13:10:09 <Bosmon> See above
2018-07-13T13:10:59 <cindyli> Bosmon, georgitodorov, dandimitrov, sounds like you can use gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json5, which starts untrusted flow manager on 8081, CBFM on 8084 and is backed with pouchdb persistence
2018-07-13T13:11:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - sounds great - what about the config that I listed?
2018-07-13T13:11:27 <Bosmon> Is it supported/working?
2018-07-13T13:12:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: the config you mentioned is to start CBFM only, and uses port 8081
2018-07-13T13:13:08 <jhernandez> Bosmon: oh, cool! going for it
2018-07-13T13:14:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok I see
2018-07-13T13:14:18 <cindyli> 8081 is the common port used by most configs, which could be easily conflict with standalone apps started with other configs,  such as gpii-app probably
2018-07-13T13:14:31 <Bosmon> I guess we need to make even more effort to explain what all our configs do
2018-07-13T13:14:49 <dandimitrov> cindyli, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json5 config
2018-07-13T13:14:57 <cindyli> np
2018-07-13T13:15:17 <dandimitrov> and it starts a local cloud flow manager ? (CFM)
2018-07-13T13:15:28 <cindyli> Bosmon: i will enhance the README in gpii/configs/ directory in the GPII-1990 branch i\'m working on
2018-07-13T13:15:44 <cindyli> dandimitrov: yes, it does start a local untrusted flow manager
2018-07-13T13:16:19 <cindyli> dandimitrov: let me know if you only want to start a cloud based flow manager
2018-07-13T13:17:23 <cindyli> the best way to start a cloud is to use the VM in the universal root directory. That VM will start perfs server on 9081, CBFM on 9082 and couchdb on 5984
2018-07-13T13:17:38 <cindyli> the advantages of this VM are:
2018-07-13T13:17:55 <cindyli> 1. no port conflicts with your things started on your host machine
2018-07-13T13:18:42 <cindyli> 2. all ports for servers started in the VM are forwarded to the host machine, so you can access them like accessing ports on your host machine
2018-07-13T13:19:05 <cindyli> 3. it uses couchdb instead of pouchdb, which is the closest config used by the production cloud

2018-07-13T13:20:41 <cindyli> let me know if you have problems

2018-07-13T13:32:58 <jhernandez> Bosmon: weird ... npm says that it can\'t find the dev release you just published
2018-07-13T13:34:01 <jhernandez> No compatible version found: gpii-windows@0.3.0-dev.20180713T125916Z.3aecce7

2018-07-13T13:47:32 <dandimitrov> cindyli: It works! It saves setting changes correctly.
2018-07-13T13:48:43 <dandimitrov> But there a rather strange misbehaviour for the PSP when using that config - it creates two instances of the gpii-app
2018-07-13T13:50:36 <cindyli> congrats, dandimitrov. i wonder if the problem with starting two instances of the gpii-app relates to this config starts 2 separate severs?
2018-07-13T13:51:13 <dandimitrov> From what I found it is caused by the fact that our configuration registrates the gpii-app under the flowManger - see here https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/master/configs/app.dev.json#L12
2018-07-13T13:51:20 <cindyli> what\'s the relationship between starting gpii-app and starting GPII server instances
2018-07-13T13:51:38 <cindyli> ah ha
2018-07-13T13:51:43 <dandimitrov> together with the fact that there are two flowManager components
