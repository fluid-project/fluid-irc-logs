2018-02-25T18:50:32 <sayak9495> @cindyli Hi. My name is Sayak from India. Few days back, I mailed you about my interest in GSOC. I've been trying to upgrade my local ACheceker to PHP7 . Succeded in the installation part. But after that, in the index page it's showing several errors. (https://ibb.co/iNuPAx) . I'm working on the bugs.
2018-02-25T18:50:33 <sayak9495> Waiting for your suggestion/feedback. And I need some more suggestion on what to mention in the Project proposals. What is expected of me. (p.s- I've already read student guide)
2018-02-25T18:50:33 <sayak9495> Apart from upgrading AChecker, is there any other thing that needs to be taken care of. And I was thinking of making the UI a little better as well.
