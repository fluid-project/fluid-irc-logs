b'2018-05-01T20:42:50 <cindyli> mrtyler: how can we make sure 65 runs before 67
2018-05-01T20:43:02 <mrtyler> fyi: the "-job" means that this manifest describes a kubernetes Job. contrast with -svc (for Services), -deploy (for Deployments), etc.
2018-05-01T20:43:25 <cindyli> i see
2018-05-01T20:43:30 <cindyli> 65 needs to clean up the couchdb database then load the static data
2018-05-01T20:43:31 <mrtyler> there are some ways but can you tell me why / how the second job depends on the first job?
2018-05-01T20:43:46 <cindyli> 67 loads more dynamically built data
2018-05-01T20:44:17 <cindyli> 67 doesn\'t wipe the database of course
2018-05-01T20:46:08 <mrtyler> it doesn\'t look like Jobs support dependencies: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40713573/how-to-write-sequential-jobs-as-a-kubernetes-job#40714080
2018-05-01T20:46:21 <mrtyler> how about this approach: "Ideally, if anything requires sequencing you should capture it within a single unit (container).
2018-05-01T20:46:24 <mrtyler> "

2018-05-01T20:46:41 <mrtyler> can we do all the dataloading from one Job?
2018-05-01T20:50:33 <cindyli> would be nice to use only one job. i just don\'t know how\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-01T20:51:47 <cindyli> mrtyler: do you have ideas? this job is to replicate these 2 lines - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L80-L81
2018-05-01T20:52:24 <gmoss> alanharnum: do you have 5 minutes to chat about SJRK branches?
2018-05-01T20:52:55 <alanharnum> gmoss: sure, be right there
2018-05-01T20:58:44 <cindyli> mrtyler: i\'m heading offline. will talk tomorrow. thanks and see you
2018-05-01T20:59:20 <mrtyler> ok, just trying to figure out where /data used to come from
2018-05-01T20:59:22 <mrtyler> see you tomorrow

2018-05-01T14:59:12 <cindyli> Bosmon: colinclark and you and I should meet in my vidyo room in 1 mins
2018-05-01T14:59:49 <colinclark> I\'d like to continue this crit for a bit, if we can
2018-05-01T15:00:15 <colinclark> I have a meeting at noon, but perhaps we can meet after the crit winds down?
2018-05-01T15:00:18 <cindyli> sure, let\'s do it right after, since we are all in that meeting anyway
2018-05-01T15:00:35 <colinclark> great

2018-05-01T15:07:10 <cindyli> mrtyler: gpii-infra deploys both the prefs server and the flow manager at port 8081:

2018-05-01T15:07:35 * clown_ joined the channel
2018-05-01T15:07:58 <cindyli> just curious why there\'s no concern about a port conflict?

2018-05-01T15:15:11 <michelled> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning will be at 11:30 today
2018-05-01T15:17:28 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark: see u in my vidyo room
2018-05-01T15:17:28 * jhung has quit
2018-05-01T15:18:23 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-05-01T15:20:45 <mrtyler> cindyli: port 8081 is only used inside the container, so there\'s no chance of port conflict
2018-05-01T15:21:24 <cindyli> i see, the port is not mapped from the container to the outer world
2018-05-01T15:21:29 <mrtyler> personally i probably would have used different ports e.g. to better support local dev scenarios, but i didn\'t set up any of those port numbers
2018-05-01T15:21:44 <mrtyler> it is, but it uses port 80, not port 8081, as described in the -deploy files you linked
2018-05-01T15:22:15 <mrtyler> we can change it if it\'s causing problems or is confusing
2018-05-01T15:22:53 <mrtyler> to clarify: 8081 inside the container is mapped to port 80 outside the container
2018-05-01T15:23:00 <mrtyler> load balancers talk to the container on port 80
2018-05-01T15:24:04 <cindyli> i see. the mapping is in -svc file
2018-05-01T15:24:42 <cindyli> mrtyler: i also have a question on this line - https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/modules/deploy/83-flowmanager-deploy.erb#L22
2018-05-01T15:25:07 <cindyli> shall the url be "https://" with staging and production?
2018-05-01T15:25:28 <mrtyler> no
2018-05-01T15:25:36 <mrtyler> that is an "internal" url. look at the domain
2018-05-01T15:26:03 <mrtyler> one day we will have https everywhere, but today we only have https from the public internet to the load balancer and http from there for internal connections
2018-05-01T15:26:09 <cindyli> ah i see. cool. thanks, mrtyler.

2018-05-01T16:59:10 <Justin_o> stegru: do you know about the windows contrast modes? Are they programmatically available?
2018-05-01T16:59:29 <cindyli> that\'s right, i will send the invite once confirmed with simon, sgithens
2018-05-01T16:59:32 <stegru> yes, Justin_o
2018-05-01T16:59:48 <sgithens> cindyli: Thanks!
2018-05-01T16:59:54 <cindyli> np
2018-05-01T17:00:20 <Justin_o> stegru: thanks.. would you know if that is something that could accessed through a browser extension
2018-05-01T17:00:33 <Justin_o> i\'m not finding any info on it
2018-05-01T17:01:15 <stegru> I very much doubt it
2018-05-01T17:01:33 <stegru> it would depend on the browser exposing it, I guess
2018-05-01T17:02:51 <stegru> you could ask GPII, Justin_o
2018-05-01T17:03:00 <stegru> i mean, the extension asks GPII
2018-05-01T17:03:18 <Justin_o> hmm.. you mean other than through the preferences that are set?
2018-05-01T17:04:00 <stegru> yes
2018-05-01T17:05:28 <stegru> do you know if high contrast mode on windows effects browsers at all?
2018-05-01T17:06:22 <stegru> if so, it would be good if you a call .getComputedStyle (or whatever it is) on it, to detect the background for a field, or something
2018-05-01T17:19:02 * jhung joined the channel
2018-05-01T17:22:08 <Justin_o> stegru: i believe it will adjust the colour of the brower\'s chrome
2018-05-01T17:22:12 <Justin_o> but that\'s about it
2018-05-01T17:22:28 <Justin_o> not the contents of the pages it displays
2018-05-01T17:22:43 <stegru> of course, Justin_o - otherwise you wouldn\'t be doing it!
2018-05-01T17:22:47 <Justin_o> that\'s what the UIO+ browser extension would do
2018-05-01T17:22:50 <Justin_o> yes :)

2018-05-01T20:03:24 <cindyli> mrtyler: with the recent change to my universal GPII-2630 branch, the couch data loading has been split into 2 parts to load data from different directories. My question is, in this directory - https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/tree/master/aws/modules/deploy, if i:
2018-05-01T20:03:28 <cindyli> 1. rename "https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/modules/deploy/65-dataloader-job.erb" to "https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/modules/deploy/65-dataloader-job.erb"
2018-05-01T20:03:45 <cindyli> not meant to paste links
2018-05-01T20:04:03 <cindyli> 1. rename "65-dataloader-job.erb" to "65-dataloader-static.erb"
2018-05-01T20:04:41 <cindyli> 2. add for example a new step named "67-dataloader-load-built-data.erb"
2018-05-01T20:05:20 <cindyli> would 65 still runs and runs before 67?
2018-05-01T20:13:15 <cindyli> i made the change and steps run as expected

2018-05-01T20:41:00 <cindyli> ok, mrtyler
2018-05-01T20:41:31 <mrtyler> i like the name dataloader-static, i\'m not sure about the name dataloader-load-built-data. i would drop load and data, and i\'m not sure what "built" means and how it would differ from "static"?
2018-05-01T20:41:44 <cindyli> does this look good:
2018-05-01T20:41:44 <cindyli> 65-dataloader-load-static-data-job.erb
2018-05-01T20:41:58 <mrtyler> it is not guaranteed that 65 runs before 67
2018-05-01T20:42:00 <cindyli> 67-dataloader-load-built-data-job.erb
2018-05-01T20:42:09 <cindyli> oh no
