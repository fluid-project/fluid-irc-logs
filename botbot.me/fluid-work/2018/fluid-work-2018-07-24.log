b'2018-07-24T16:39:18 <Justin_o> is that what you meant?
2018-07-24T16:39:19 <jhernandez> yes, but I need the bump to happen locally as well
2018-07-24T16:39:34 <jhernandez> exactly, can I avoid such reset?
2018-07-24T16:40:03 <Justin_o> jhernandez: if you don\'t want to actually publish it, you may want to use the --test flag
2018-07-24T16:40:20 <Justin_o> it will then create a package of what would have been published
2018-07-24T16:40:33 <Justin_o> you could then just unpack that for your installer.. would that help
2018-07-24T16:41:30 <jhernandez> yes, it will create a .tar and I can get the version from there, but I just wanted to know whether there was a more straightforward way

2018-07-24T16:43:19 <jhernandez> okay, that was my first approach before asking you, so I\'ll go that way and let\'s see what do we exactly want after submitting a first iteration of the pr
2018-07-24T16:43:26 <jhernandez> thanks a lot!
2018-07-24T16:43:50 <Justin_o> jhernandez: the other way is to change the "cleanCmd" used
2018-07-24T16:44:13 <Justin_o> you could do something like `fluid-publish cleanCmd=""`
2018-07-24T16:44:15 <jhernandez> hmm, via options ...
2018-07-24T16:44:37 <jhernandez> okay, let me try that way
2018-07-24T16:44:38 <Justin_o> jhernandez: that would still publish to npm though
2018-07-24T16:45:09 <Justin_o> currently all the cleanCmd does is to reset the package.json file.. it defaults to https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/blob/master/package.json#L52
2018-07-24T16:45:10 <jhernandez> but not if I add the --test argument, isn\'t it?

2018-07-24T16:57:44 <jhernandez> although it crashes when cleanCmd is ""
2018-07-24T16:58:45 <jhernandez> but if you supply a valid noop command, it does nothing and the version number remains

2018-07-24T14:56:26 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'ve been thinking about the proper way to move loginUser() logoutUser() and other invokers out of request handlers. these invokers fire various events, for example, https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L114, that will then trigger the matchmaking process on "gpii.flowManager.matchMakingRequest" component - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/no
2018-07-24T14:56:27 <cindyli> de_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerRequests.js#L174
2018-07-24T14:57:27 <cindyli> both "gpii.flowManager.matchMakingRequest" and "gpii.flowManager.userLogonHandling.stateChangeHandler" that invokers reside are grades to compose login request handlers
2018-07-24T14:57:36 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L198-L199
2018-07-24T14:58:23 <cindyli> this means, it might be more proper to move both userLogonHandling and matchMaking out of request handlers
2018-07-24T14:59:03 <cindyli> i\'m worried if these things are moved straight into gpii.flowManager.local, this "local" component might be too heavy loaded
2018-07-24T15:00:24 <cindyli> shall this logic be moved into one or even two subcomponents of gpii.flowManager.local?
2018-07-24T15:00:29 <cindyli> what do you think, Bosmon?
2018-07-24T15:01:57 <cindyli> this change will also affect untrusted flow manager that overrides logon state change handler with the untrusted version: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L42

2018-07-24T16:26:40 <Justin_o> hello
2018-07-24T16:26:43 <jhernandez> quick question
2018-07-24T16:26:49 <Justin_o> sure
2018-07-24T16:27:36 <jhernandez> so I\'m figuring out a way to bump the version in a package.json file according to the versioning conventions we use when publishing dev versions with fluid-publish
2018-07-24T16:28:30 <jhernandez> I see that you apply devVersion.timestamp in ISOxx.short git hash
2018-07-24T16:29:49 <jhernandez> in the case where I don\'t want to publish the artifact, just bump the version, what would be the best way to achieve this?
2018-07-24T16:30:04 <jhernandez> and if it makes sense, of course
2018-07-24T16:32:19 <Justin_o> jhernandez: sorry, in a meeting, trying to listen and read this so may be a bit slow
2018-07-24T16:32:42 <jhernandez> hehe, no prob
2018-07-24T16:32:52 <Justin_o> what is the purpose of the version bump
2018-07-24T16:33:05 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-07-24T16:34:51 <jhernandez> create an installer of gpii-app that includes that bumped version
2018-07-24T16:35:10 <Justin_o> jhernandez: and what is the reason for not publishing?
2018-07-24T16:35:23 <jhernandez> so when looking at "About Morphic", you will see what it is included in gpii-app\'s package.json file
2018-07-24T16:36:26 <jhernandez> nothing, but the thing is that if you perform a dev release, the version in the package.json file will remain as it is
2018-07-24T16:38:49 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hmm.. i think it gets published with the dev version.. for example https://unpkg.com/infusion@3.0.0-dev.20180326T173646Z.8c6a109b1/package.json
2018-07-24T16:39:02 <Justin_o> but it gets reset afterwards
2018-07-24T16:39:07 <Justin_o> in the working directory
