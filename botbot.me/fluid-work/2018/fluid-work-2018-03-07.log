b'2018-03-07T17:23:58 <sgithens> gmoss: I think we had chatted about potentially having an earlier meeting, but didn\'t make a firm decision on it
2018-03-07T17:25:41 <gmoss> sgithens: that rings true. Again, I\'m good with either time :)

2018-03-07T17:27:01 <Justin_o> I\'ve added a meeting to the fluid calendar for i18n at the 2pm EST timeslot for now, but we can adjust that if it\'s incorrect
2018-03-07T17:38:08 * michelled joined the channel
2018-03-07T17:51:14 <Justin_o> gmoss: due to daylight savings time changing this weekend, the i18n meeting for next week will be an hour later
2018-03-07T17:51:29 <Justin_o> i\'ve updated the entry in the fluid calendar
2018-03-07T17:52:19 <gmoss> Justin_o: okay, thanks for the heads-up! I hadn\'t realized it was so soon
2018-03-07T17:52:43 <Justin_o> me neither, simonjb informed us during our meeting
2018-03-07T17:52:49 * gmoss has a dislike of DST in general
2018-03-07T17:54:15 <simonjb> the Canada/US time difference with Europe will be an hour less for the next 2 weeks until Europe switches to summer time: 11 March to 25 March
2018-03-07T17:56:12 <simonjb> then we\'ll be back in sync and have the same difference as now

2018-03-07T18:00:18 <colinclark> ok
2018-03-07T18:03:24 <pranjaljn97> cindyli: I was wondering why we haven\'t stored static text like in (language_text) table as a XML/JSON form instead of calling DB again and again? It could reduce Database overhead
2018-03-07T18:06:58 <cindyli> pranjaljn97: i agree loading data files into mysql is a good idea. thanks

2018-03-07T18:22:48 <colinclark> ah, that\'s a good question
2018-03-07T18:22:50 <colinclark> i have no idea
2018-03-07T18:23:00 <colinclark> i think the general template for p4a would do
2018-03-07T18:23:06 <simonjb> ok, cool
2018-03-07T18:23:12 <colinclark> you could reuse the template from last year
2018-03-07T18:23:23 <simonjb> I\'ll start with that anyway

2018-03-07T20:27:04 <Bosmon> Looks like KASPARDNIET was pretty good about writing stuff up after Toronto

2018-03-07T20:36:45 <kasparnet> ah yes, KASPARDNIET, my long lost russian brother... He is indeed good at writing stuff up
2018-03-07T20:37:03 <kasparnet> btw, for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1877, a good chunk of that stuff is done in GPII-1230

2018-03-07T10:48:53 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! Can we discuss a bit the following JIRA issue whenever you have the time: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2891
2018-03-07T10:49:21 <georgitodorov> I am wondering whether in general we can wait for a promise to be resolved in a test sequence
2018-03-07T10:49:40 <georgitodorov> Or, if we should fire an event in this particular case (i.e. when the key out has finished)
2018-03-07T10:53:09 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon can comment in more detail, but it\'s definitely possible to wait for a single promise to resolve in a test sequence.
2018-03-07T10:53:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll find you a link in just a second.
2018-03-07T10:53:52 <the-t-in-rtf> https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html#supported-fixture-records
2018-03-07T10:54:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Check out the "task" section.
2018-03-07T10:55:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Here are the Fluid tests that exercise that functionality: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/IoCTestingTests.js#L492
2018-03-07T10:55:07 <the-t-in-rtf> @georgitodorov ^^^
2018-03-07T10:57:02 <georgitodorov> Thank you, the-t-in-rtf! This is exactly what I needed.

2018-03-07T13:30:29 <georgit> Bosmon: I looked into the issue with the magnifier remaining on the screen after the tests conclude. Unfortunately, waiting for the key out process to finish properly does not help.
2018-03-07T13:31:13 <georgit> However, I made another experiment - I waited for some time before keying out. In that case the magnifier was properly closed.
2018-03-07T13:31:40 <Bosmon> georgit - ok, that\'s very interesting
2018-03-07T13:31:44 <georgit> My best guess is that the tests execute very quickly and by the time they finish, the magnifier application has not yet started
2018-03-07T13:32:06 <georgit> I.e. it is fully functional only after the user has keyed out
2018-03-07T13:32:10 <Bosmon> stegru - any ideas?
2018-03-07T13:32:22 <Bosmon> Is there any way we could wait longer or more properly for the magnifier?
2018-03-07T13:32:46 <stegru> how is the magnifier being closed?
2018-03-07T13:34:35 <stegru> ah, normally
2018-03-07T13:34:47 <georgit> Bosmon: I thought that we can test with snapsets that do not include the magnifier while knowing that this will not resolve the problem. Then I remembered that the only profile which has multiple preference sets has the magnifier as well...
2018-03-07T13:35:13 <georgit> And we do need to have tests for multiple preference sets
2018-03-07T13:40:41 <Bosmon> georgit - well, the issue is real
2018-03-07T13:40:46 <Bosmon> We had better try to understand it
2018-03-07T13:41:05 <stegru> Bosmon, georgit : currently, gpii doesn\'t wait for the magnifier to start.. and GPII doesn\'t even start the magnifier, it starts a process (utilman.exe) that tells windows to start the magnifier
2018-03-07T13:41:08 <Bosmon> It seems like it is most likely it is not an issue with your code or your tests
2018-03-07T13:42:24 <stegru> gpii.windows.waitForProcessStart("magnify.exe") will return a promise that resolves when it\'s started
2018-03-07T13:43:05 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-03-07T13:43:49 <georgit> stegru: Can we stop this process before the promise has been resolved?
2018-03-07T13:44:15 <Bosmon> stegru - can we stick this into the settings handler for the solution?
2018-03-07T13:45:09 <stegru> georgit: probably not
2018-03-07T13:45:12 * jhung1 joined the channel
2018-03-07T13:45:34 <stegru> yes, Bosmon
2018-03-07T13:45:51 <stegru> the settings handler returns a promise resolving when it\'s started? yes
2018-03-07T13:46:08 <Bosmon> sounds great
2018-03-07T13:46:08 <stegru> but, does the promise even get waited upon?
2018-03-07T13:46:17 <Bosmon> and also a correponding one for stopping
2018-03-07T13:46:25 <Bosmon> Well, it will once kaspar\'s pull request goes in
2018-03-07T13:46:41 * jhung has quit
2018-03-07T13:47:13 <Bosmon> Well no, it does already
2018-03-07T13:47:45 <Bosmon> Sorry, no, it doesn\'t already :)
2018-03-07T13:47:53 <stegru> is that so? recently I\'ve ran into a similar issue to this
2018-03-07T13:48:01 <Bosmon> This is the current block: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L508
2018-03-07T13:48:03 <stegru> ok
2018-03-07T13:48:54 <Bosmon> The block is still there in Kaspar\'s branch, but it now subsumes start/stop actions into a special system
2018-03-07T13:49:32 <stegru> yes, and he even integrated the magnifier starting code
2018-03-07T13:50:06 <Bosmon> Yes, it has become a special "launchHandler" - https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/982911a2815e40174f18082ee6c63ce39b579292/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L922
2018-03-07T13:50:19 <Bosmon> So, with this new implementation, do we still need to do anything extra to wait?
2018-03-07T13:50:38 <stegru> reading it now
2018-03-07T13:51:51 <stegru> ok, provided that the handler\'s \'set\' can return a promise which is waited upon - yes
2018-03-07T13:52:04 <Bosmon> ok great
2018-03-07T13:53:33 <stegru> i\'ll get it sorted once I\'ve got another thing out of the way

2018-03-07T17:21:53 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon, gmoss: Double checking, is the i18n meeting next week the same time as it was this week?
2018-03-07T17:22:19 <Bosmon> I think that is what we thought?
2018-03-07T17:22:23 <Bosmon> Especially if sgithens can make it
2018-03-07T17:23:20 <sgithens> I can make the same time next week
2018-03-07T17:23:21 <gmoss> Bosmon Justin_o the-t-in-rtf I thought there was talk of an earlier one, at 7:00 EST, which was written in the pad. I\'m good either way
2018-03-07T17:23:30 <gmoss> Sorry if this complicates things
2018-03-07T17:23:44 <the-t-in-rtf> We had talked about that, but I thought we\'d settled on 20:00 CET.
