2018-04-09T17:20:53 <gtirloni_> ok, so now that it's running.. we're back to the same situation. let's see when it finishes
2018-04-09T17:21:05 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: okay, i wonder why it's blocking your PRs
2018-04-09T17:21:28 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: do you know what's needed to whitelist your account?
2018-04-09T17:22:37 <gtirloni_> the block step mentioned here (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/.buildkite/pipeline.yml#L1-L3) is actually a call to this: https://github.com/avtar/unblock-buildkite-pr-job
2018-04-09T17:24:35 <gtirloni_> somehow i'm not a recognized contributor, but i'm listed in infusion's contributor list.. i don't know if there's a threshold of code changes

2018-04-09T17:38:40 <gtirloni_> i'm sending them the details
2018-04-09T17:38:47 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: so strange, thanks though

2018-04-09T17:42:43 <gtirloni_> Justin_o: i was wondering if you'd like the commits to be squashed into a single one or if it's okay to leave them as is? in terms of how infusion's commit log will look like (since i committed some stuff that was just tests)
2018-04-09T17:43:50 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: ah good point.. yes, do you mind to squash those down
2018-04-09T17:44:04 <gtirloni_> will do, one sec

2018-04-09T12:48:07 <jhernandez> I guess that, one day, we must sit down together and review all those components that don\'t make sense anymore, and create those that could make sense

2018-04-09T13:02:05 <Justin_o> however when I click on the details it looks like it\'s finished
2018-04-09T13:03:16 <gtirloni> interesting, i\'ll email it to their support. that should have been updated by buildkite\'s backend
2018-04-09T13:03:21 <gtirloni> thanks for the heads up
2018-04-09T13:03:49 <Justin_o> gtirloni: no problem, i guess is should wait to hear back about their reply before merging those buildkite changes
2018-04-09T13:04:02 <gtirloni> yes, please. they usually take <2h to reply
2018-04-09T13:04:14 <gtirloni> thanks for the review

2018-04-09T14:48:40 <gtirloni> do you have word to open this natively? i wonder which font it\'s really using. maybe it\'s not one of the public MS fonts we can install on linux

2018-04-09T14:49:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: looks like it\'s just using "Times"
