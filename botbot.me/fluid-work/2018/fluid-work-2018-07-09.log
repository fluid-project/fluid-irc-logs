2018-07-09T12:32:35 <Bosmon> Hey there stegru - do you have time at 16:30 to chat to Gregg for a bit about IoD?
2018-07-09T12:32:45 <stegru> yes
2018-07-09T12:32:51 <Bosmon> cool
2018-07-09T12:32:53 <stegru> wait
2018-07-09T12:32:56 <stegru> yes
2018-07-09T12:32:57 <Bosmon> Looks like it should be just a half an hour job
2018-07-09T12:33:38 <stegru> I\'m sure gregg could make it stretch ;)
2018-07-09T12:34:02 <Bosmon> Yeah, unfortunately I see that the 5pm one after it has now mysteriously vanished
2018-07-09T12:34:24 <stegru> well, I have another meeting at 5
2018-07-09T12:34:35 <Bosmon> Ah no wait I am looking at the wrong month
2018-07-09T12:34:37 <Bosmon> That\'s great
2018-07-09T12:34:53 <stegru> you\'re in it too
2018-07-09T12:35:11 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-07-09T12:35:16 <Bosmon> Yes, I know

2018-07-09T12:43:51 <stegru> Bosmon: just so you know, IoD isn\'t quite ready for review
2018-07-09T12:44:00 <stegru> but you\'re welcome to do so anyway
2018-07-09T12:44:17 <Bosmon> Cheers
2018-07-09T12:44:25 <Bosmon> Just having a random drive-by whilst it is topical : P

2018-07-09T13:41:00 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i\'m running "grunt lint" on the universal master that has your recent linting improvment and seeing this error: >> Local Npm module "gpii-grunt-mdjson-lint" not found. Is it installed?
2018-07-09T13:41:00 <cindyli> Warning: Task "mdjsonlint" not found. Use --force to continue.
2018-07-09T13:41:30 <cindyli> have you seen it before?
2018-07-09T13:42:02 <cindyli> i did "rm -rf node_modules/; npm install"
2018-07-09T13:42:59 <the-t-in-rtf> When you say "the universal master that has my improvements", which do you mean?
2018-07-09T13:43:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I\'m working on a new branch with the new linting plugin at the moment.
2018-07-09T13:43:50 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli ^^^
2018-07-09T13:43:52 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: was referring to the merge of your branch into the master - https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/2b56e76135b1927ac9b19c9babb97869d490f9b8
2018-07-09T13:44:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, OK.
2018-07-09T13:44:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Got it.
2018-07-09T13:44:43 <the-t-in-rtf> So, we\'re working on improving this, but for now depending on where npm sticks things, you might need to add inherited dependencies as a temporary dev dependency.
2018-07-09T13:45:02 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you should pick up the missing plugin from gpii-grunt-lint-all, but don\'t because grunt.loadNpmTasks is really dumb.
2018-07-09T13:45:16 <the-t-in-rtf> If you install it as a dev dependency, it should work, and there is a better fix coming in this pull.
2018-07-09T13:45:34 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all/pull/2
2018-07-09T13:45:49 <cindyli> ok, meaning i should manually install "gpii-grunt-mdjson-lint" for now?
2018-07-09T13:45:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Once that\'s available the improved npm task loader will be available.
2018-07-09T13:46:06 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but it\'s only needed as a dev dependency.
2018-07-09T13:46:18 <cindyli> cool. good to know. thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2018-07-09T13:46:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I hope that eventually most of this will get much easier.
2018-07-09T13:47:08 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you\'d just need the one dependency on gpii-grunt-lint-all.

2018-07-09T13:59:33 <Bosmon> stegru - could the "unrelated intermittent failure" be that bad promise-non-return that you found 2 weeks ago?
2018-07-09T13:59:54 <stegru> ah yes Bosmon that might be it
2018-07-09T14:00:16 <stegru> I wasn\'t surprised by it, but I couldn\'t remember what it was
2018-07-09T14:00:28 <Bosmon> Could you just make a little writeup and a pull with it if you have a mo?
2018-07-09T14:00:45 <Bosmon> It won\'t really require tests since all it does is remove intermittent failures :)
2018-07-09T14:01:14 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - seems pretty odd, I know I haven\'t really managed to understand what the issue is in detail
2018-07-09T14:01:25 <Bosmon> But how could it be that cindyli sees one behaviour, and that we and CI see another?
2018-07-09T14:01:31 <the-t-in-rtf> npm versions?
2018-07-09T14:01:34 <Bosmon> Ah wow
2018-07-09T14:02:01 <the-t-in-rtf> might also depend on whether there are two things that use the same dep and it gets pulled up?
2018-07-09T14:02:20 <stegru> GPII-3140 - enableRegisteredAT.set doesn\'t return a promise (no code for it yet)
2018-07-09T14:02:30 <Bosmon> stegru brilliant thanks
2018-07-09T14:02:33 <the-t-in-rtf> so it might vary per project, although we should have seen it in testing that.
2018-07-09T14:02:39 <cindyli> what npm version do you use, the-t-in-rtf
2018-07-09T14:02:55 <cindyli> mine is 5.6.0
2018-07-09T14:03:09 <the-t-in-rtf> same here
