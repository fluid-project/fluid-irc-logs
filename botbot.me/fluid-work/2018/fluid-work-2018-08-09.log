2018-08-09T18:23:22 <jhernandez> I just left a comment on the dataloader pull request about what an empty prefs set should look like
2018-08-09T18:24:42 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/626#discussion_r209030835
2018-08-09T18:25:07 <jhernandez> other than that, it works great
2018-08-09T18:25:09 <jhernandez> yay!!
2018-08-09T18:25:15 <clown> jhernandez:  yes, I just got an email from github pointing that out.  A lot of copy and pasting \xe2\x80\x94 do you need me to do that for your demo?
2018-08-09T18:25:22 <jhernandez> no
2018-08-09T18:25:31 <clown> okay, I\'ll do it "at my leisure".
2018-08-09T18:25:37 <jhernandez> I just prepared the empty pref sets here
2018-08-09T18:25:51 <jhernandez> you know, I wrote one and then I did a
2018-08-09T18:26:20 <jhernandez> cp emptyPrefSet.json5 `uuidgen`.json5
2018-08-09T18:27:03 <jhernandez> I did a loop and created 79 more so we will have 80 empty prefsets to play with

2018-08-09T19:58:58 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Can I put a sort of regular test case along with the webdriver based ones in rawModules? The type you would put in a regular modules listing with an `expect` number?
2018-08-09T20:03:41 <sgithens> and I\'m trying to figure out which repo the `rawModules` is introduced in. It does look like it\'s infusion, I\'m guessing maybe gpii-webdriver?
2018-08-09T20:05:58 <jhernandez> stegru: just to double check, do I need to pull  the last changes from https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/638 ? I think we end up saying that it won\'t be needed after cindyli comes with a solution for it, isn\'t it?
2018-08-09T20:06:29 <stegru> that\'s right, jhernandez
2018-08-09T20:06:37 <jhernandez> ok
2018-08-09T20:06:39 <jhernandez> thanks
2018-08-09T20:06:41 <jhernandez> :)
2018-08-09T20:07:09 <stegru> are there any notes on what cindy is doing?
2018-08-09T20:17:01 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2018-08-09T20:50:25 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, the only difference is the preamble and epilogue, i.e. what is run before and after each set of test steps.
2018-08-09T20:50:35 <the-t-in-rtf> the syntax is otherwise identical.
2018-08-09T20:51:18 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the only thing the "rawModules" option and associated machinery from gpii-express does is to add steps before and after the steps specified in rawModules.
2018-08-09T20:51:44 <the-t-in-rtf> And "rawModules" is definitely a gpii-express thing
2018-08-09T20:52:13 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s likely we can completely replace that machinery once we all start using test sequences.

2018-08-09T22:25:53 <jhernandez> stegru: sweet!!
2018-08-09T22:26:13 <jhernandez> I\'m building an installer right now
2018-08-09T22:26:42 <jhernandez> Some people wanted one ASAP to keep testing
2018-08-09T22:28:41 <jhernandez> I have to share this one with them if it\'s okay, but right after that, I will incorporate your fix and hopefully, include Cindy\'s one on the highContrast themes as well
2018-08-09T22:29:04 <jhernandez> ASTEA needs to double check tomorrow morning
2018-08-09T22:33:14 <jhernandez> I\'m aiming to build a new one tomorrow in the afternoon
2018-08-09T22:33:38 <stegru> ok great
2018-08-09T22:40:03 <jhernandez> stegru: are you available for a quick test?
2018-08-09T22:40:44 <jhernandez> I\'m getting this VERRRRRY weird error when trying to start the gpii-app with npm start
2018-08-09T22:40:47 <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/4cY9FYhs
2018-08-09T22:42:26 <jhernandez> if so, you can pull from gpii-app/feds-audit, delete youur node_modules, run npm install and then, try running via npm start
2018-08-09T22:43:08 <jhernandez> why on hell is it trying to resolve a module from C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GPII\\windows\\resources\\app\
ode_modules\\ ?
2018-08-09T22:51:08 <jhernandez> nevermind - I restarted the vm and it worked

2018-08-09T11:33:48 <the-t-in-rtf> (he let me know he\'d be a little late to our meeting)
2018-08-09T11:34:22 <the-t-in-rtf> guess not.
2018-08-09T11:34:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, we\'re in my room when you all are ready
2018-08-09T11:35:11 <the-t-in-rtf> we being @sgithens and @Bosmon and I thought Cindy.
2018-08-09T11:35:31 <Bosmon> Hi
2018-08-09T11:35:39 <Bosmon> I will be there
2018-08-09T11:38:49 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, @bosmon, while we wait, there is a fluid-eslint dependency that is only listed as a dev dependency in eslint-config-fluid
2018-08-09T11:39:03 <the-t-in-rtf> this causes errors in upstream packages that use our config.
2018-08-09T11:39:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I can submit a PR to move that to the non-dev dependencies if you agree that\'s reasonable.
2018-08-09T11:41:54 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, Steve\'s here now.
2018-08-09T11:41:58 <the-t-in-rtf> just waiting for you.
2018-08-09T11:42:00 <Bosmon> ok on my way
2018-08-09T11:43:40 <Bosmon> I\'m struggling to install blasted VIDDYO
2018-08-09T11:43:48 <Bosmon> I\'d forgotten that this is my first Vidyo call on the New Machine....
2018-08-09T11:45:14 <Bosmon> Could someone tell me what the "portal address" is?
2018-08-09T11:49:59 <sgithens> You can use one of yor million chrome tabs
2018-08-09T11:50:08 <Bosmon> ?
2018-08-09T11:50:09 <the-t-in-rtf> just a second.
2018-08-09T11:50:13 <sgithens> https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca&roomKey=HzoLG2Cja8
2018-08-09T11:50:26 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, man.
2018-08-09T11:50:51 <Bosmon> If anyone still has me in their contacts list, could you tell me what my username is
2018-08-09T11:51:38 <the-t-in-rtf> amb26work@ponder.co.uk
2018-08-09T11:51:54 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, ,org
2018-08-09T11:51:57 <the-t-in-rtf> dot org even
2018-08-09T11:52:12 <the-t-in-rtf> The message was a tooltip and oddly broken up.
2018-08-09T11:52:23 <the-t-in-rtf> amb26work@ponder.org.uk
2018-08-09T11:54:46 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry, I can\'t make it work
2018-08-09T11:54:53 <Bosmon> It\'s the username I need, not the registered email
2018-08-09T11:54:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you have Skype installed?
2018-08-09T11:54:56 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-08-09T11:55:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Let\'s use that for now
2018-08-09T11:55:07 <the-t-in-rtf> and you can wrestle with Vidyo at your leisure
2018-08-09T11:55:10 <the-t-in-rtf> if that counts as leisure
2018-08-09T12:03:41 <jhernandez> sgithens: FYI, I just set up the gpii-app locally to make use of the cloud in the way I told you yesterday
2018-08-09T12:03:44 <jhernandez> works to the perfection
2018-08-09T12:03:49 <Bosmon> jhernandez - brilliant!
2018-08-09T12:04:07 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yay!
2018-08-09T12:04:14 <jhernandez> and saving is working to the perfection
2018-08-09T12:04:41 <jhernandez> look at this https://preferences.prd.gpii.net/preferences/elaine
2018-08-09T12:05:02 <jhernandez> I just included the captions/enabled
2018-08-09T12:05:22 <Bosmon> jhernandez - cool - but isn\'t that an endpoint we planned to remove?
2018-08-09T12:05:34 <jhernandez> yup
2018-08-09T12:06:57 <sgithens> Bosmon jhernandez: Yes, or at least not be public
2018-08-09T12:07:13 <jhernandez> at this moment it is public
2018-08-09T12:07:22 <jhernandez> right
2018-08-09T12:08:02 <jhernandez> my system is just pointing to https://flowmanager.prd.gpii.net as I was said
2018-08-09T12:08:31 <jhernandez> not dealing with that endpoint at all
2018-08-09T12:10:12 <jhernandez> performed another update to it, now added DPI

2018-08-09T13:52:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Who tested before the upgrade?
2018-08-09T13:52:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I was gonna wait until the meeting, but since I\'m an admin, both are warning me about broken things.
2018-08-09T13:52:24 <the-t-in-rtf> GPII has two plugins that stopped working.
2018-08-09T13:52:33 <the-t-in-rtf> The Fluid instance has a broken apps link that I\'m looking into.
2018-08-09T13:54:11 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, @gtirloni or someone with admin perms on wiki.fluidproject.org will need to fix that.
2018-08-09T13:54:15 <the-t-in-rtf> apparently I can\'t.
2018-08-09T13:55:31 <gtirloni> tested what? migrated the DB to another VM?
2018-08-09T13:56:46 * georgitodorov has quit
2018-08-09T13:56:48 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: have you had to fix anything? these app link warnings happen when one instance is down (like it was a few minutes ago). they go away afterwards.
2018-08-09T13:57:14 <gtirloni> and what meeting is that?
2018-08-09T13:57:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I meant that I meant to bring it up in the arch meeting
2018-08-09T13:57:39 <the-t-in-rtf> (which I missed last night as I was off)
2018-08-09T13:57:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, can you double-check it?
2018-08-09T13:58:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I saw that Confluence was up and tried to refresh it, it may have my credentials now, which aren\'t enough.
2018-08-09T13:58:14 <the-t-in-rtf> well, a token associated with my Confluence username or something else.
2018-08-09T13:58:48 <cindyli> jhernandez, georgitodorov: i checked the label of the "chinese traditional" language in the latest QSS branch - https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/feature/QSS. it looks great. only its english part could be more precise as "Chinese Traditional (Taiwan)" if we are using Taiwan language pack.
2018-08-09T13:59:04 <jhernandez> ok
2018-08-09T13:59:17 <jhernandez> that\'s the kind of feedback I wanted
2018-08-09T13:59:24 <jhernandez> thanks a lot
2018-08-09T13:59:28 <stegru> cindyli, it might also be useful for you to also provide the correct characters
2018-08-09T13:59:56 <stegru> \xe6\x8b\x89\xe5\xb1\x8e
2018-08-09T14:00:30 <cindyli> stegru: do you know what\'s the meaning of the chinese words you just pasted?
2018-08-09T14:00:37 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: ok. looks green now, thanks. re: the broken add-ons, have you had to update any? i can\'t see the errors
2018-08-09T14:00:46 <cindyli> what did you translate from? i\'m curious
2018-08-09T14:00:47 <jhernandez> it\'s a very tiny detail, but I wanted to make sure that we weren\'t going to offend chinese users with what they see on the QSS and what it\'s really been applied on the system
2018-08-09T14:01:00 <stegru> cindyli: i don\'t know, you tell me ;)
2018-08-09T14:01:01 <cindyli> stegru: it\'s quite improper
2018-08-09T14:01:03 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2018-08-09T14:01:28 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni, it\'s not possible to update them, there aren\'t versions for our version of JIRA
2018-08-09T14:01:33 <the-t-in-rtf> hence my original question
2018-08-09T14:01:37 <jhernandez> stegru: xDDDDDDD
2018-08-09T14:01:39 <the-t-in-rtf> that should be something checked pre-upgrade.
2018-08-09T14:01:44 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: it would be nice to bring this topic up in the arch meeting anyway, who maintains GPII infrastructure because I\'ve been doing it on a best effort basis and whenever I\'m busy with IDRC/FLUID tasks, the GPII apps and VM\'s go unmaintained (just upgraded them all yesterday). There\'s a mismatch of expectations on both sides I believe
2018-08-09T14:01:47 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: are they important?
2018-08-09T14:01:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t think so at all.
2018-08-09T14:02:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I was going to bring them up next week and see if anyone noticed they were missing.
2018-08-09T14:02:09 <the-t-in-rtf> and then suggest removing them
2018-08-09T14:02:12 <the-t-in-rtf> to make less work.
2018-08-09T14:02:24 <Bosmon> Well, it could mean "to pull an arrow"
2018-08-09T14:02:31 <Bosmon> But this isn\'t the customary translation : P
2018-08-09T14:02:34 <the-t-in-rtf> one is the JIRA SSL plugin, which I have to believe is not needed.
2018-08-09T14:02:38 <the-t-in-rtf> the other is the threaded comments plugin.
2018-08-09T14:02:39 <stegru> sorry if I offended you, cindyli
2018-08-09T14:03:21 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s good to know that it\'s still in your lap, I am happy to help close the loop on some of these when I can.
2018-08-09T14:03:27 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s almost no effort for me.
2018-08-09T14:03:45 <cindyli> nah, it makes me laugh a lot. you made my day, stegru ;)
2018-08-09T14:04:19 <Bosmon> hahaha
2018-08-09T14:04:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - we should talk in a bit about how to resolve the high contrast issue
2018-08-09T14:04:30 <gtirloni> cool, +1. the ssl addon is not required, i just uninstall i. the threaded comments, i\'m not sure. In any case, there usually isn\'t anyone from GPII assigned to verify these things so they either go unmaintained/outdated/insecure or I get a lot of heat whenever I touch them. Since they\'re hosted at the IDRC, I\'ve taken to breaking things and apologizing later, unfortunately. It\'s definitely something that should be discussed
2018-08-09T14:04:35 <Bosmon> Have you had time to look at the report?
2018-08-09T14:06:09 <cindyli> yes, for sure, Bosmon. i did look at the report and am going to reproduce it on my gpii-app VM. when would you be able to talk?
2018-08-09T14:06:22 <Bosmon> about half an hour?
2018-08-09T14:06:38 <cindyli> sure
2018-08-09T14:06:40 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: the app links look okay, thnks for checking that. they were using a token associated with my username before.. i guess yours will be fine too (I think JIRA complaints when there\'s not enough permissions when adding the links). Looks like Confluence and both JIRAs are okay now
2018-08-09T14:06:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, thanks for checking.
2018-08-09T14:08:32 <gtirloni> np!
2018-08-09T14:09:12 <gtirloni> if anyone can forward this message over to slack, I\'ve created GPII-3280 for the JIRA DB migration, I just need someone from GPII Ops team to validate it\'s all fine and take ownership of the VM
2018-08-09T14:13:29 <jhernandez> gtirloni: hey, just copy/pasted that over to slack
2018-08-09T14:13:33 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-08-09T14:13:36 <gtirloni> thanks!
2018-08-09T14:17:17 <colinclark> throw it over the wall!
