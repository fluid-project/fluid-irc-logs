2018-06-07T06:39:00 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, "marked" was poorly maintained and our main vector for inherited vulnerabilities.
2018-06-07T06:39:26 <the-t-in-rtf> its replacement is markdown-it, and I worked hard to ensure that it could be used in roughly the same way.
2018-06-07T06:40:02 <the-t-in-rtf> The main upshot is that you need to fiddle with your dependencies if you use markdown in your handlebars templates.
2018-06-07T06:40:23 <the-t-in-rtf> if you don\'t, you just need to not include that helper in your renderer.
2018-06-07T06:42:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I specifically looked at your work on the (then) dev-pmt when rewriting it, so you should be able to do what you want.

2018-06-07T07:36:18 <the-t-in-rtf> the only small gotcha is that mixing in html into your markdown is disabled by default, but that\'s configurable through declarative options.

2018-06-07T14:06:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: here\'s my code change so far for connecting PSP with the cloud: https://github.com/GPII/universal/compare/master...cindyli:GPII-2965#diff-2a48866aecf7478e0d32381b8179c327R229
2018-06-07T14:07:17 <cindyli> i discovered a problem at writing tests and realized i might miss a piece in the code
2018-06-07T14:07:48 <cindyli> and need your advice
2018-06-07T14:08:48 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-06-07T14:09:34 <cindyli> the current code work flow is: when PSP use lifecycle manager to apply preferences, the preferences to be saved to the cloud triggers a session model change: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/5892f901560567f56d3cf18fc6d70d8af1f75919/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L229
2018-06-07T14:10:34 <cindyli> a model listener on this path will fire a onPrefsUpdated event: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/5892f901560567f56d3cf18fc6d70d8af1f75919/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L79
2018-06-07T14:11:45 <cindyli> if GPII runs in untrusted config, gpii.flowmanager.untrusted listens to this event and write the updated preferences to the cloud: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/5892f901560567f56d3cf18fc6d70d8af1f75919/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L65-L68
2018-06-07T14:12:43 <cindyli> when cloud returns success message, onSaveDone will be fired, otherwise, onError will be fired: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/5892f901560567f56d3cf18fc6d70d8af1f75919/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L83
2018-06-07T14:14:20 <cindyli> the problem is, i think the lifecycle manager should wait for the firing of onSaveDone before responding to PSP
2018-06-07T14:15:13 <cindyli> however, onSaveDone is only fired with untrusted config when there\'s a cloud
2018-06-07T14:15:31 <cindyli> it won\'t exist with all-in-local config
2018-06-07T14:17:08 <cindyli> so creating an aggregate event doesn\'t make sense
2018-06-07T14:17:37 <cindyli> do you have suggestions?

2018-06-07T15:05:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - an aggregate event is fine, we can just override the constituents of it in one configuration
2018-06-07T15:05:15 <Bosmon> That\'s sort of what the major point of our aggregate event architecture was
2018-06-07T15:05:22 <Bosmon> That is, the fact that the constituents are stored as a named hash
2018-06-07T15:05:30 <Bosmon> It allows for this form of "enlatening"
