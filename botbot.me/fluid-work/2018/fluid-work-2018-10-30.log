b"2018-10-30T21:10:13 <stegru> thanks for the hint
2018-10-30T21:11:21 <stegru> original path was S:\\src\\gpii\\other\\gpii-metrics\\gpii-standalone-metrics - perhaps with the other stuff at the end, it became too long
2018-10-30T21:12:33 <jhernandez> I'm sure there's something wrong in napi's node-gyp side or the like, given that I had problems in the rebuild step when building against electron IIRC
2018-10-30T21:15:29 <jhernandez> couldn't see anything relevant, but I had the problem in the postinstall rebuild step, and the problem was coming from ref-napi, which is a dep of ffi-napi
2018-10-30T21:22:06 <jhernandez> though I didn't continue digging

2018-10-30T13:46:44 <stegru> de nada
2018-10-30T13:47:10 <stegru> is the tray icon getting updated to, jhernandez ?
2018-10-30T13:47:59 <jhernandez> yup, it\'s part of gpii-app and Astea already took care of it

2018-10-30T15:05:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: The PRs for UIO+ are all ready for more review. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pulls
2018-10-30T15:06:40 <Justin_o> i\'ll also need to bump the version in the manifest file which i can include in one of these PRs or in another one after. Please let me know.
2018-10-30T15:07:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, I believe these PRs are both needed for the pilots as well as other code changes that have already made it in.
2018-10-30T15:07:28 <Justin_o> but have not yet been released in a published version to the chrome web store.

2018-10-30T15:51:50 <jhernandez> I\'ve asigned https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3485 to you
2018-10-30T15:52:37 <jhernandez> I talked to Bern and I\'m aware that it\'s a known issue and that right now we\'re going to use it until we have a new animated logo
2018-10-30T15:53:50 <dandimitrov> Hey, jhernandez, ok. We\xe2\x80\x99ll updated it once there\xe2\x80\x99s the animated version
2018-10-30T15:54:20 * avtar joined the channel
2018-10-30T15:54:29 <jhernandez> yeah, I only reported it to have a JIRA
2018-10-30T15:55:00 <dandimitrov> jhernandez, you also you can find the code for the \xe2\x80\x9cremote surveys payload\xe2\x80\x9d here: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/GPII-3477
2018-10-30T15:55:00 <jhernandez> I guess that any of us can replace it when it\'s ready
2018-10-30T15:55:39 <dandimitrov> absolutely, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to have it repored.
2018-10-30T15:55:59 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: is it ready to go? or shall I wait until tomorrow? I do know that you have received the endpoints a few minutes ago
2018-10-30T15:56:38 <jhernandez> so I assumed that we wouldn\'t have this fully ready until tomorrow
2018-10-30T15:57:08 <dandimitrov> jhernandez, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tested it manually and everything seems to be working fine. We still need to write tests for it but this is something that can be done afterwards
2018-10-30T15:57:25 <jhernandez> got it
2018-10-30T15:58:42 <jhernandez> tonight I\'m planning to put all the stuff together, build an installer and do some testing

2018-10-30T16:02:57 <dandimitrov> great, jhernandez, let us know if there\xe2\x80\x99re any troubles
2018-10-30T16:03:04 <jhernandez> will do
2018-10-30T16:03:13 <Bosmon> Cheers Justin_o - I merged one UIO+ pull and the other one is looking pretty good
2018-10-30T16:03:25 <Bosmon> I wonder if you could say something to this comment - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/19/files#r227173803
2018-10-30T16:03:25 <jhernandez> I\'m also in touch with Bern, who is doing some last minute updates to the logos
2018-10-30T16:03:40 <Bosmon> It\'s still not completely clear to me why we are using a MutationObserver strategy
2018-10-30T16:03:42 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: I\'ll let you all know if there\'s anything bad going on ;)
2018-10-30T16:04:07 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - I just wanted to check in about the status of the renderer coverage work - does it look like that is taken care of now?
2018-10-30T16:04:46 <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon, I think so. I was about to ping Tony for a review

2018-10-30T17:05:14 <Bosmon> Is it the slack at https://gpii.slack.com ?
2018-10-30T17:05:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that\'s how it operates the simplification. It hides the content by setting the visibility to invisible. However, there may be some select elements that you\'d want to still show. We explicitly go back over these and sent them too visible. When dynamic content is injected into a portion that is still invisible, but we want to be visible, we have to update it by setting it to visible.

2018-10-30T19:17:18 <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli : for my username/password work, the browser tests are failing because the preferencesService requires("gpii-express-user") but it\'s still written in the style to support browser usage (no require) and it has a browser test, though a lot of the other core parts don\'t anymore. I\'m wondering if the preferencesService is still expected to be used in a browser?  If not, should I convert it\'s browser test to a

2018-10-30T19:56:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry, back now, and looking at your question.. well it gets injected when you select the text, so it may or may not exist on the page before then. And that would be the same for other content that gets injected by the site itself
2018-10-30T19:56:57 <Justin_o> for example a dialog or tooltip may have similar issues

2018-10-30T21:01:52 <stegru> jhernandez, have you had any issues building ffi-napi, regarding napi.h not being found?
2018-10-30T21:03:22 <jhernandez> stegru: yup
2018-10-30T21:03:57 <jhernandez> but what are you trying to build with napi?
2018-10-30T21:05:03 <stegru> not gpii, the standalone metrics
2018-10-30T21:05:20 <jhernandez> okay, because I found it but got it fixed
2018-10-30T21:05:28 <stegru> i can do "install ffi-napi" in an empty directory and it works
2018-10-30T21:05:42 <stegru> ok, spill the beans
2018-10-30T21:05:43 <jhernandez> version of node?
2018-10-30T21:06:04 <stegru> 10.11.0
2018-10-30T21:06:10 <stegru> or any, I don\'t care
2018-10-30T21:06:12 <jhernandez> I guess you\'re using edge-js as well?
2018-10-30T21:06:16 <stegru> no
2018-10-30T21:06:18 <jhernandez> hmmm
2018-10-30T21:07:31 <jhernandez> stegru: unc paths involved?
2018-10-30T21:08:04 <stegru> no
2018-10-30T21:09:29 <stegru> ah!
2018-10-30T21:09:38 <jhernandez> stegru: ?
2018-10-30T21:10:01 <stegru> maybe there was.. or maybe it was a long path.. because i did "subst j: c:\\sflkjsdfkl", then it worked
