2018-05-09T15:59:21 <mrtyler> cindyli: i have a question you may not have time to answer before the arch weekly :)
2018-05-09T16:00:25 <mrtyler> in your local development for recent changes, how "end-to-end" is your testing?
2018-05-09T16:01:26 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2018-05-09T16:01:33 <mrtyler> i.e., have you tested the workflow *all the way* from gpii/windows running locally, through local FM, to cloud FM, all the way to couchdb?
2018-05-09T16:01:48 * cindyli has quit
2018-05-09T16:01:58 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-05-09T16:02:02 <mrtyler> my expectation is that you\'ve only really been testing cloud-based FM or maybe local->cloud FM, and haven\'t been using gpii/windows
2018-05-09T16:02:19 <mrtyler> cc colinclark
2018-05-09T16:03:08 <cindyli1> you are right, mrtyler, i\'ve tested cloud-based FM and local FM to cloud FM, but not with gpii/windows yet
2018-05-09T16:03:24 <mrtyler> ok cool
2018-05-09T16:04:04 <mrtyler> do you expect to do the full end-to-end including gpii/windows? if so, when? if not, do you know if someone else plans to work on that?
2018-05-09T16:04:24 <mrtyler> btw it\'s fine if you haven\'t thought about this question at all :) this is follow-up to a slightly different conversation
2018-05-09T16:04:27 <mrtyler> (hence cc\'ing colin)
2018-05-09T16:04:31 <cindyli> i could do it
2018-05-09T16:05:55 <mrtyler> related question: do you think *anyone* has ever tested the full flow, local device -> cloud?
2018-05-09T16:06:13 <mrtyler> i think you are closest to having done this
2018-05-09T16:07:39 <colinclark> What does it mean to test local to cloud FMs, cindyli?
2018-05-09T16:07:44 <colinclark> what kind of testing does this entail?
2018-05-09T16:08:20 <cindyli> colinclark: untrusted configs in the universal repo
2018-05-09T16:09:12 <colinclark> running the automated tests?
2018-05-09T16:11:05 <cindyli> yes, colinclark, and also the automated production config tests that talks to the real cloud
2018-05-09T16:12:11 <cindyli> mrtyler: if you meant having the local device to test with the real remote cloud, i don\'t think anyone has done that
2018-05-09T16:12:23 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: Sorry I thought I had sent a reply to Jonathan Jude re: community meeting -- thanks for picking that up
2018-05-09T16:12:28 <mrtyler> cindyli: that is what i meant. thanks
2018-05-09T16:12:31 <cindyli> talking about the local device, it reminds me i\'m probably not the right person to test this part
2018-05-09T16:12:47 <mrtyler> [channeling colin] who is the right person, do you think? :)
2018-05-09T16:12:56 <colinclark> hahaha
2018-05-09T16:13:33 <colinclark> seems to me that you probably are a good person to test it, cindyli, while you\'re developing it
2018-05-09T16:13:42 <colinclark> everyone should presumably testing the full system workflow
2018-05-09T16:14:24 <cindyli> colinclark: if you mean to test using a windows VM, i can do it.
2018-05-09T16:14:31 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s what I mean
2018-05-09T16:14:34 <mrtyler> isn\'t it kind of difficult without an actual windows device? or is testing in a windows vm sufficient (idk about, e.g. cardreader interactions with a virtual machine)
2018-05-09T16:14:45 <colinclark> I mean, it really really sucks that we don\'t still have full stack automated integration tests
2018-05-09T16:14:52 <colinclark> a VM works just fine
2018-05-09T16:14:57 <mrtyler> ok
2018-05-09T16:14:59 <colinclark> the card reader is really a "leaf" integration point
2018-05-09T16:15:13 <colinclark> which can be easily simulated with a web browser for this kind of purpose
2018-05-09T16:15:20 <colinclark> Certainly the readers have to be tested
2018-05-09T16:15:33 <colinclark> and they are, I believe, as part of kavya\'s QA test regime
2018-05-09T16:16:02 <colinclark> but man, do we ever need a setup where a developer can spin up a VM and test it against a full-on development "cloud"
2018-05-09T16:16:06 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: np :)
2018-05-09T16:17:13 <mrtyler> +1 :)

2018-05-09T16:38:21 <cindyli> mrtyler: i have a problem with the flow manager deployment in my gpii-infra branch after merging in the recent changes in the master that add steps for using ssh certificate for the prefs server and the flow manager. the problem is now the flow manager is not able to getting data from the preferences server
2018-05-09T16:38:55 <cindyli> the url that was used by the flow manager to retrieve prefs from the prefs server is: https://github.com/cindyli/gpii-infra/blob/GPII-2630/aws/modules/deploy/83-flowmanager-deploy.erb#L31
2018-05-09T16:38:59 <mrtyler> cindyli: ok i have ~15 minutes if you want to chat
