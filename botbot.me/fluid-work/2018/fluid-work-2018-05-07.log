b"2018-05-07T20:06:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - really?
2018-05-07T20:06:07 <Bosmon> Why treat them differently
2018-05-07T20:06:23 <cindyli> the ones for acceptance tests will only be touched by developers
2018-05-07T20:06:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - doesn't that make it all the more important that they exhibit developer-level usability?
2018-05-07T20:06:48 <Bosmon> For example being in separate files in which comments are allowed?
2018-05-07T20:07:17 <cindyli> ummm\xe2\x80\xa6 ok, i will auto convert the prefs files for acceptance tests too

2018-05-07T13:15:09 <Bosmon> Do you have any ideas about https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2992 ?

2018-05-07T13:17:10 <kasparnet> Bosmon, hmmm... nope, not sure I\'ve seen it before either
2018-05-07T13:17:18 <kasparnet> but I do agree it has something to do with Narrator

2018-05-07T14:16:26 <cindyli> Bosmon: i think i\'d better check with you on this problem before debugging into the complex use of settings handlers: I merged the master, which includes the implementation of "TypingEnhancement", into my GPII-2630 branch. Now tests/integrationTests.js in my branch fails at handling this section - https://github.com/GPII/universal/compare/dad9bfbb21b299bcfea04275fb01b859204cb9c9...a5e50ed548b72a853e6397baf7c85b917fe70dd9#diff-69cd21a
2018-05-07T14:16:26 <cindyli> dbc352c021c118e18b7ff3785R248
2018-05-07T14:16:38 <cindyli> the expected result is https://pastebin.com/61qt8435
2018-05-07T14:17:02 <cindyli> sorry, the above is the result I received
2018-05-07T14:17:07 <cindyli> the expected result should be https://pastebin.com/GGig4rXG
2018-05-07T14:17:45 <cindyli> see the difference at line 100-109, where the settings for "TypingEnhancement" should be 1 but my branch now receives "undefeind"
2018-05-07T14:18:29 * kavya has quit
2018-05-07T14:18:34 <cindyli> I suspect it might be some discrepancies in win32.json, or solution registry \xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-07T14:19:20 <cindyli> but seems to me those have all been merged into my branch - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-2630-temp
2018-05-07T14:19:36 <cindyli> do you have any idea?
2018-05-07T14:34:35 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2018-05-07T14:34:42 <Bosmon> The cause will be the recent merge of the pull from kasparnet
2018-05-07T14:36:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: i think there must be something special in my branch that causes this failure, which doesn\'t happen in the master
2018-05-07T14:37:34 <cindyli> but the weird thing is other settings are handled fine, so I suspect my branch might be missing configs such as solution registry or so
2018-05-07T14:37:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, perhaps
2018-05-07T14:38:12 <cindyli> ok, i will debug
2018-05-07T14:45:02 * jhung joined the channel
2018-05-07T14:46:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, the TypingEnhancement solution looks entirely new
2018-05-07T14:46:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - how did it get into your branch and not into trunk?
2018-05-07T14:47:12 <cindyli> Bosmon: i merged the master into my branch
2018-05-07T14:47:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, so why does this solution entry show up in the diff?
2018-05-07T14:47:40 * michelled joined the channel
2018-05-07T14:48:22 * danayo joined the channel
2018-05-07T14:48:28 <cindyli> i compare the commit at the point of my last merge and the latest commit in the master branch
2018-05-07T14:48:54 <cindyli> so i have a sense of what\'s new in the master that causes the failure in my branch
2018-05-07T14:50:51 <Bosmon> kasparnet - what does it mean if a solution doesn\'t have any launchHandlers?
2018-05-07T14:50:55 <Bosmon> Is it assumed to be always running?
2018-05-07T14:51:32 <kasparnet> yes, it is assumed to be running
2018-05-07T14:51:41 <Bosmon> ok
2018-05-07T14:52:20 <kasparnet> though it depends on the presence of an "isRunning"
2018-05-07T14:52:26 <kasparnet> block
2018-05-07T14:52:45 <Bosmon> What if there isn\'t either
2018-05-07T14:52:48 <kasparnet> so the system will look for an isRunning block, which might or might not refer to a launchhandler
2018-05-07T14:53:17 <kasparnet> yes, in that case, it is considered running always, afai remembre
2018-05-07T14:53:47 <kasparnet> but not 100% certain
2018-05-07T14:59:53 <Bosmon> kasparnet - cheers
2018-05-07T15:00:09 <Bosmon> Does anything look suspicious to you in the TypingEnhancement solutions entry that cindyli pasted above?

2018-05-07T19:27:34 <cindyli> yes, i did
2018-05-07T19:27:38 <Bosmon> Oh great
2018-05-07T19:27:39 <Bosmon> What was it?
2018-05-07T19:28:16 <cindyli> there was a change to a preferences file used for that integration test, need to migrate it into prefsSafes.json
2018-05-07T19:29:50 <cindyli> the fix is as simple as this - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/commit/8821a88da3927e352d865558d4e7926194b31ddb
2018-05-07T19:29:59 <cindyli> but it does take me a while to figure out ;)
2018-05-07T19:36:38 <cindyli> mrtyler: when you have some time, i wonder if you could help me to figure out something with gpii-infra deployment, very likely with the data loading step. I promise i will take notes this time :)
