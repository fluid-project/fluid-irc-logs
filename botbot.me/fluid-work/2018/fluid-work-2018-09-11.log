2018-09-11T12:38:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: hello.. sorry to bother you.. i\'m having some trouble with the CI setup for the Infusion repo. It doesn\'t seem to let me trigger the testing. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/931#issuecomment-420014820
2018-09-11T12:38:54 <Justin_o> Can you direct me where to look at the configuration for it?
2018-09-11T12:39:48 <Justin_o> alanharnum: ^
2018-09-11T12:41:01 <gtirloni> Justin_o: hey! looks like a did a bad copy/paste job. You need to be added here: https://github.com/fluid-project/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/macros.yml
2018-09-11T12:41:21 <alanharnum> thanks gtirloni, i\'ll add him
2018-09-11T12:41:50 <Justin_o> gtirloni, alanharnum: thanks
2018-09-11T12:41:54 <gtirloni> i may have copied this from gpii/ci-service and forgot to review the admin list
2018-09-11T12:42:51 <Justin_o> i\'m having trouble opening github. It looks like they are having problems https://status.github.com/messages
2018-09-11T12:43:12 <alanharnum> Justin_o: you should be added to the admin list now
2018-09-11T12:43:40 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks
2018-09-11T12:46:21 <Justin_o> alanharnum:  is this list used for just infusion or other fluid-project repos too?
2018-09-11T12:46:42 <alanharnum> Justin_o: it should cover all fluid-project repos, we should review it at some point
2018-09-11T12:47:30 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'m looking at it now.. i guess only admins can trigger tests for non-whitelisted users?
2018-09-11T12:47:38 <alanharnum> correct
2018-09-11T12:48:03 <alanharnum> whitelisted users will kick off a CI job automatically, admins can trigger a job with "ok to test"
2018-09-11T12:48:54 <Justin_o> thanks, so i\'m thinking only those that can merge code should be admins.
2018-09-11T12:49:17 <Justin_o> this is different for different repos, but i guess it should be fine to include them all in the list

2018-09-11T13:09:13 <gtirloni> it might be useful to add ops people to the admin list, for helping with CI issues

2018-09-11T13:21:35 <dandimitrov> Hey, stegru, I was hoping you could give us a hand with a problem we\xe2\x80\x99ve been struggling with in the gpii-app, that involves changes to the display metrics of the Windows machine - DPI, resolution, high contrast...
2018-09-11T13:21:42 <dandimitrov> Part of the problem seems to be caused by an event that Electron provides that should indicate such changes are already applied to the system. However, it appears that that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case - this event seems to be fired too early, before the Windows\xe2\x80\x99s UI has been rescaled.
2018-09-11T13:22:22 <dandimitrov> Are you familiar with a low level event in Windows that is fired AFTER all changes to the display have finished? For example, when a DPI change is fully applied, meaning that everything is rescaled and after that the event is fired
2018-09-11T13:22:54 <dandimitrov> I also tried a mechanism for system level events that Electron provides but without success - https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md#winhookwindowmessagemessage-callback-windows
2018-09-11T13:22:55 <dandimitrov> and listened for the event - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/hidpi/wm-dpichanged  but again it was fired too early :/
2018-09-11T13:23:39 <stegru> ok
2018-09-11T13:23:52 <stegru> yes, wm_dpichanged would have been my guess
2018-09-11T13:26:52 * Jess_ joined the channel
2018-09-11T13:29:48 <stegru> dandimitrov: WM_DISPLAYCHANGE would be another attempt, it might also be sent before it\'s applied
2018-09-11T13:29:50 <stegru> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/gdi/wm-displaychange
2018-09-11T13:30:35 <dandimitrov> stegru: I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a try with the Electron mechanism
2018-09-11T13:31:10 <stegru> you could also set a timeout when the message is received
2018-09-11T13:33:08 <dandimitrov> we\xe2\x80\x99ve been using a timeout with the Electron\xe2\x80\x99s event as well but there seem to be problem with that as we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how fast the machine is
2018-09-11T13:45:35 * clown joined the channel
2018-09-11T13:48:27 <dandimitrov> stegru: That event seem to be fired even earlier (before Electron\xe2\x80\x99s event) :/ Can you think of some other approach that may work :?
2018-09-11T13:51:09 <stegru> yes, detect when the window position has changed.. WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED - I presume electron already has an event for this
2018-09-11T13:51:13 * avtar joined the channel

2018-09-11T13:52:51 <jhung> fluid-everyone: the design crit will start in 8 minutes. Today we\'re talking about the word spacing icon in UIO.
2018-09-11T13:53:58 <stegru> that\'s probably the best one, dandimitrov, because you\'re reacting to the position changing and not just the dpi changing (there may be other reason the position changed)
2018-09-11T13:56:28 <stegru> there\'s also WM_SIZE and WM_MOVE

2018-09-11T14:13:25 <dandimitrov> stegru: still these are sent just before the Electron event\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-09-11T14:13:41 <stegru> damn
2018-09-11T14:14:46 <stegru> maybe set a timer that polls the position for a few seconds, and if the position has changed call your "fix the pop-ups" function?
2018-09-11T14:15:21 <stegru> it looks like electron also listens on those events, then takes some time for it to adjust
2018-09-11T14:16:32 <dandimitrov> stegru: I tried finding out what system events electron uses but it\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy job
2018-09-11T14:16:48 <dandimitrov> yep, it look like it

2018-09-11T14:18:32 <dandimitrov> It looks like they
2018-09-11T14:19:27 <dandimitrov> they\xe2\x80\x99re using some Qt/Chromium library there - https://github.com/RSATom/Qt/blob/master/qtwebengine/src/3rdparty/chromium/ui/display/display_change_notifier.cc

2018-09-11T14:32:12 <stegru> dandimitrov, sort of related, in case you didn\'t know: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1207 - electron doesn\'t provide a way of detecting window movement
2018-09-11T14:33:36 <stegru> oh no, there\'s a \'resize\' and \'move\' event

2018-09-11T14:34:17 <dandimitrov> stegru: yep, seems like an old issue
2018-09-11T14:34:57 <dandimitrov> stegru: but there are a lot of issues for DPI changes that are still present
2018-09-11T14:36:31 <stegru> that\'s why I aim for good old 96dpi screens ;)
