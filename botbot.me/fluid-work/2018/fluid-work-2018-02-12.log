2018-02-12T20:06:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli, michelled, simonjb: would one of you have time  to review this PR for me https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/873
2018-02-12T20:06:48 <Justin_o> It's fairly small, just adding in a missing dependency to a bunch of pages
2018-02-12T20:07:03 <Justin_o> but it's critical in that all of the demos look broken on the build site right now
2018-02-12T20:11:44 <cindyli> i will have a look
2018-02-12T20:12:03 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks :)
2018-02-12T20:12:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: you may want to look over all of the demos, examples, and manual tests. I believe I checked them all but it's worth double checking.
2018-02-12T20:13:21 <cindyli> ok. Justin_o, those demos should also look broken when running locally, right?

2018-02-12T10:33:16 <javjarfer[m]> good morning stegru
2018-02-12T10:33:35 <stegru> hello!
2018-02-12T10:33:55 <javjarfer[m]> hi there!
2018-02-12T10:34:08 <javjarfer[m]> did you time to talk about the logging issue?
2018-02-12T10:34:16 <javjarfer[m]> we should trace where that thing comes
2018-02-12T10:35:47 <stegru> yes, ok
2018-02-12T10:36:01 <stegru> what thing?
2018-02-12T10:36:56 <javjarfer[m]> do you remember that we have found that in fact the RestartManager is returning a fail, but the rejected promise is not being logged?
2018-02-12T10:37:01 <stegru> ah yes
2018-02-12T10:37:19 <javjarfer[m]> well, I have no clue about why that happens xD
2018-02-12T10:37:23 <stegru> damn
2018-02-12T10:38:39 <javjarfer[m]> it\'s not like execution could fail, because in that piece of code, promise is constructed and \'immediately\' returned
2018-02-12T10:38:43 <stegru> do rejections get logged from other places?
2018-02-12T10:38:55 <javjarfer[m]> without any furthers calls to anything
2018-02-12T10:40:26 <javjarfer[m]> I was supposing that they do
2018-02-12T10:41:54 <stegru> yes, they do -  i just forced the registry settings handler to return a rejected promise
2018-02-12T10:42:29 <stegru> oh wait - we\'re using start/stop blocks
2018-02-12T10:42:49 <javjarfer[m]> > yes, they do -  i just forced the registry settings handler to return a rejected promise
2018-02-12T10:42:50 <javjarfer[m]> oohh, true...
2018-02-12T10:42:57 <javjarfer[m]> not real settings handlers
2018-02-12T10:44:07 <stegru> i\'m guessing kasparnet\'s recent work in this area will fix this
2018-02-12T10:44:19 <javjarfer[m]> > i\'m guessing kasparnet\'s recent work in this area will fix this
2018-02-12T10:44:20 <javjarfer[m]> Yes, I also think so
2018-02-12T10:44:50 <javjarfer[m]> well, then we can move forward, I will continue to see the state of that list of processes at the moment of the failure
2018-02-12T10:45:06 <javjarfer[m]> to see which is exactly the problem causing the RmRestart failing
2018-02-12T10:45:10 <stegru> ok
2018-02-12T10:45:52 <stegru> did you manage to get the vm in the bad state?
2018-02-12T10:46:01 <javjarfer[m]> eys
2018-02-12T10:46:02 <javjarfer[m]> yes**
2018-02-12T10:46:12 <stegru> nice, do you know how you did it?
2018-02-12T10:46:20 <javjarfer[m]> clean VM with installation of GPII with the fail
2018-02-12T10:46:24 <stegru> ok
2018-02-12T10:46:53 <stegru> does running as admin fix it?
2018-02-12T10:47:54 <javjarfer[m]> the fail is triggered when GPII is started from the installer
2018-02-12T10:48:00 <javjarfer[m]> if you restart it disappear
2018-02-12T10:48:52 <stegru> interesting
2018-02-12T10:49:31 <javjarfer[m]> yes, with fail 352 if I don\'t remember it wrong
2018-02-12T10:49:37 <javjarfer[m]> yes, it\'s 352
2018-02-12T10:49:59 <stegru> "ERROR_FAIL_RESTART" - yes, no shit?
2018-02-12T10:50:09 <javjarfer[m]> yes xD
2018-02-12T10:51:42 <stegru> what about trying this...
2018-02-12T10:52:07 <stegru> put the RmRestart code into a separate node application, and run that
2018-02-12T10:55:11 <stegru> it might have something to do with the way the installer starts GPII - as though the process is tainted with something
2018-02-12T10:56:00 <javjarfer[m]> mm I understand, yes I also think that could work, it looks like processes started from the installer could be special
2018-02-12T10:57:03 <javjarfer[m]> okay, I will try to get the list the state of processes, and after logging that I will try to execute it in another instance, which do you think I should put that?
2018-02-12T10:59:04 <stegru> i think just execute the script manually first, just to see if it works
2018-02-12T10:59:37 <stegru> hmm.. maybe if gpii started that script then that may still inherit the problem
2018-02-12T11:01:45 <stegru> ok, i have an easier hack to test this... in the top of /gpii.js - make it restart itself (setan argument/env so it does it once)
2018-02-12T11:02:50 * yuriy__ has quit
2018-02-12T11:07:32 <javjarfer[m]> oh, I can test that, rebuild the installer and see what happens
2018-02-12T11:14:01 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: one thing, but that wouldn\'t restart the electron process itself
2018-02-12T11:14:04 * kasparnet has quit
2018-02-12T11:14:13 <javjarfer[m]> do you want to confirm if it\'s process related or gpii related?
2018-02-12T11:15:27 <stegru> process related
2018-02-12T11:15:51 <javjarfer[m]> > process related
2018-02-12T11:15:51 <javjarfer[m]> so we are expecting a fail with that procedure true?
2018-02-12T11:16:11 <stegru> something to do with how the installer starts gpii - because it worked when you restarted it?
2018-02-12T11:16:34 <stegru> I don\'t know what to expect.. but if it works, then it\'s probably process related
2018-02-12T11:20:10 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-02-12T11:27:36 <stegru> i need to nip out for an hour
2018-02-12T11:27:53 <javjarfer[m]> mm okay, but how I do restart the node process within itself? I was thinking in changing the script for starting it with the \'forever parameter\' and exiting it once using a ENV_VAR like you suggested
2018-02-12T11:27:56 <javjarfer[m]> sounds good to you?
2018-02-12T11:28:26 <javjarfer[m]> > i need to nip out for an hour

2018-02-12T14:34:19 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, so you can at least tell me what the default is, right?
2018-02-12T14:34:20 <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2018-02-12T14:34:35 <amatas> default is english/USA I think
2018-02-12T14:34:58 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, good to know.
2018-02-12T14:35:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Unfortunately I haven\'t figured out a way to change it per browser session yet, which would be helpful.

2018-02-12T14:36:10 <amatas> at the bottom of the page you can see how to change the OS languaje, it seems that also requieres a restart
2018-02-12T14:37:12 <cindyli> amatas: would you have some time today to help and teach me how to debug a docker container?
2018-02-12T14:37:25 <amatas> in the case of Firefox I think that should be enough to change the language in the database of the default profile
