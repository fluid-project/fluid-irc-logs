2018-05-25T08:21:54 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I see that the CI for the PSP3 PR has completed successfully. Is there anything else we need to address for this PR? If not, can you please merge it?
2018-05-25T08:31:33 <Bosmon> Cheers georgitodorov, taking a look now

2018-05-25T09:12:54 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I just saw your comments for the missing test cases. Do you think that we need to address all of them before this branch can be merged? Or, alternatively, write more tests after we are finished with the QSS functionality?
2018-05-25T09:30:06 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - well I guess they aren't alternatives - we can leave the branch pending if the QSS is taking priority over all other work

2018-05-25T12:04:36 <gmoss> Hi the-t-in-rtf, many apologies but I misread the meeting time and thought it was at 9:00 EDT for some reason. I won't be able to make 8:30 EDT unfortunately, is it alright if we start a little late? Or if alanharnum comes online by then, perhaps you could start without me
2018-05-25T12:12:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @gmoss.
2018-05-25T12:12:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a hard stop at 9:15, we might need to punt until Monday, when I am a lot freer.
2018-05-25T12:16:29 <gmoss> Okay, I'll get in as soon as possible and perhaps we can see how much time is left? I don't think it will take long
2018-05-25T12:16:59 <gmoss> If only I could make this train go faster hah.. Sorry once again
2018-05-25T12:24:31 <the-t-in-rtf> We'll do what we can, and Monday is a backup.
2018-05-25T12:24:36 <the-t-in-rtf> safe journey!

2018-05-25T14:47:42 <gtirloni> colinclark: thanks for the merge. we've got two builds running as of now https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/fluid-infusion/builds?state=running
2018-05-25T14:48:08 <colinclark> I love this UI
2018-05-25T14:48:31 <colinclark> I was suspiciously eyeing the one that had already taken 9 minutes, and then I saw it move from one stage of the pipeline to the next
2018-05-25T14:48:52 <colinclark> gtirloni: Do you need any other merges or is it working as expected?
2018-05-25T14:49:43 <gtirloni> it's fine for now, thanks :) i'll figure out the deployment phase for infusion next... but i might text it in a separate repo/pipeline and submit a PR once it's good enough

2018-05-25T14:51:01 <gtirloni> colinclark: yesterday i was doing a lot of tests with new builds. i was wondering if you all are receiving a ton of emails
2018-05-25T14:51:22 <colinclark> I haven't noticed them
2018-05-25T14:51:39 <colinclark> but i'm so distracted with writing, i may just not have registered them :)
2018-05-25T14:51:55 <gtirloni> cool :)
2018-05-25T14:52:04 <gtirloni> thanks again for merging that PR
2018-05-25T14:52:12 <colinclark> no problem
