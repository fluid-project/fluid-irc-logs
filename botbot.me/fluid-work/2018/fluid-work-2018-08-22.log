b'2018-08-22T16:36:40 <Bosmon> gmoss - were you in pursuit of some other issue or bug when you were pairing?
2018-08-22T16:36:47 <gmoss> indeed
2018-08-22T16:36:49 <Bosmon> I guess you had noticed the unnecessary I/O being issued?
2018-08-22T16:37:02 <Bosmon> Was that what you were after specifically or were you on the trail of something else?
2018-08-22T16:38:48 <gmoss> Bosmon: yeah, we were trying to load l10n messages for UIO\'s sliding panel in a way such that only the prefsEditor.json messages were reloaded if the sliding panel hadn\'t been opened yet, but we saw that it was loading the default locale as well as the locale we wanted to change to, and it wasn\'t working, so we decided to follow that rabbit hole
2018-08-22T16:39:09 <gmoss> I\'m not sure that it\'s got us any closer to our answer, but at least we\'ve figured out why it loads files for both locales
2018-08-22T16:41:54 <Bosmon> gmoss, alanharnum - I wanted to point you to Astea\'s current bundle stuff as well, so that we can start making steps towards a shared implementation - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/2cf2eaa53d6fc2bbdcb3e18c5d36d3456a5483e8/src/renderer/common/js/messageBundles.js
2018-08-22T16:42:09 <Bosmon> There\'s a basic version of this in their trunk and some improvements under review
2018-08-22T16:42:25 <Bosmon> But their approach is to have a build time step of a "bundle compiler", together with modelised subscription to locale changes
2018-08-22T16:43:05 <Bosmon> Their compiler is here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/2cf2eaa53d6fc2bbdcb3e18c5d36d3456a5483e8/messageBundlesCompiler.js

2018-08-22T16:53:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  Hello, I left you a question on this JIRA the other day. Not sure if you\'ve seen it. https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2914
2018-08-22T16:54:09 <Bosmon> Oh, interesting
2018-08-22T16:54:11 <Bosmon> No, somehow I didn\'t
2018-08-22T16:55:49 <Bosmon> I\'ve added a hopefully clarifying comment :)
2018-08-22T16:57:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, i\'ll take a look
2018-08-22T16:58:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems reasonable.. i\'ll cycle back to that once I\'ve finished up what I\'m currently on.. Hopefully the implementation will be as straightforward as it sounds.

2018-08-22T21:34:38 <jhernandez_> stegru: we cooked a spanish omelette for tomorrow. we\'ll be traveling all day so we don\'t spend time cooking or eating any shitty thing from gas stations
2018-08-22T21:35:07 <jhernandez_> and had a quiche lorraine for diner, was great :)
2018-08-22T21:35:23 <stegru> the chinese takeaway not far from me makes spanish omelette
2018-08-22T21:35:27 <jhernandez_> haha
2018-08-22T21:35:29 <jhernandez_> really?
2018-08-22T21:35:38 <stegru> really
2018-08-22T21:36:11 <jhernandez_> xDDD
2018-08-22T21:36:50 <jhernandez_> ok, regarding filebeat ... nothing against it
2018-08-22T21:37:48 <stegru> great - it just keeps things simple
2018-08-22T21:38:02 <jhernandez_> right
2018-08-22T21:39:27 <jhernandez_> I guess that this way we ensure that everything gets configured by us
2018-08-22T21:40:17 <jhernandez_> and we also avoid errors from a bad installation process
2018-08-22T21:40:34 <stegru> yeh, that\'s the plan
2018-08-22T21:40:41 <jhernandez_> cool
2018-08-22T21:41:43 <jhernandez_> would it be just an msi in the staging folder and setting up the bits in the wix manifest, right?
2018-08-22T21:42:21 <jhernandez_> if so ... can filebeat be distributed within our installer?
2018-08-22T21:43:10 <stegru> yes, that\'s it
2018-08-22T21:44:07 <stegru> it will just be an extra file, that gets executed
2018-08-22T21:44:47 <stegru> similar to the tasktray thing
2018-08-22T21:44:56 <stegru> except, it will work
2018-08-22T21:45:30 <stegru> i should remove that
2018-08-22T21:46:57 <jhernandez_> yeah, good idea, specially after seeing that we can\'t really succeed on it - not sure why
2018-08-22T21:47:28 <jhernandez_> oh, so we will be just adding the binary, isn\'t it?
2018-08-22T21:47:36 <stegru> yeh
2018-08-22T21:47:59 <stegru> and i\'ll make the filebeat installer silent
2018-08-22T21:48:47 <jhernandez_> I see
2018-08-22T21:51:17 <stegru> i\'m off, have a nice trip
2018-08-22T21:53:18 <jhernandez_> stegru: sure, get some rest
2018-08-22T21:53:21 <jhernandez_> and thanks
2018-08-22T21:54:36 <jhernandez_> FYI, I\'ll be on the road the next two days, but I\'ll be reachable on Skype and checking email regularly
2018-08-22T21:55:06 <stegru> I will contact you every hour
2018-08-22T21:55:57 <jhernandez_> hah
2018-08-22T21:56:05 <jhernandez_> just to check that I\'m doing fine, huh?
2018-08-22T21:56:14 <jhernandez_> that\'s beautiful
2018-08-22T21:56:17 <jhernandez_> :)
2018-08-22T21:57:30 <jhernandez_> okay, I will install slack on my phone, don\'t want to miss any party
2018-08-22T21:57:32 <jhernandez_> :P

2018-08-22T10:43:15 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone who remembers, I found a few unlinted files in infusion master and am cleaning them up.
2018-08-22T10:43:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to ask about this one: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/node-tests/README.md#tap-output-for-testem-integration
2018-08-22T10:43:39 <the-t-in-rtf> The flag still works (yay), but I fail to see why this is "for Testem integration".
2018-08-22T10:43:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to discuss and perhaps update the wording.
2018-08-22T10:43:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - great
2018-08-22T10:44:23 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - feel free to adapt the wording as needed
2018-08-22T10:44:33 <Bosmon> It seems that waharnum wrote that section
2018-08-22T10:44:37 <the-t-in-rtf> But the purpose is just to say "here\'s how you get TAP"
2018-08-22T10:44:49 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s not actually for Testem integration.
2018-08-22T10:44:54 <the-t-in-rtf> if that\'s correct, I will edit away.
2018-08-22T10:45:27 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - perhaps this was the only consumer of this information when these docs were written
2018-08-22T10:45:30 <Bosmon> Are there now others?
2018-08-22T10:45:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Testem doesn\'t do anything like that
2018-08-22T10:46:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I think what they meant is "for consistency with"
2018-08-22T10:46:17 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it\'s only integrated in the sense that they look similar when displayed in the same log.
2018-08-22T10:46:27 <Bosmon> I see
2018-08-22T10:46:36 <Bosmon> Does any tools consume this log?
2018-08-22T10:46:39 <Bosmon> Do
2018-08-22T10:46:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Various CI implementations can make sense of it.
2018-08-22T10:47:18 <the-t-in-rtf> but AFAIK none of our tools parse it themselves.
2018-08-22T10:47:25 <Bosmon> OK
2018-08-22T10:47:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess there might be some integration if they write to the same file.
2018-08-22T10:47:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll test that just to see.
2018-08-22T10:47:46 <Bosmon> Any evidence-based elaboration of this text would be great :)
2018-08-22T10:47:51 <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully there\'s not some awfulness where one is clobbering the other or only one set is written to a file.
2018-08-22T10:48:09 <the-t-in-rtf> for example, I strongly suspect the node tests aren\'t run with that flag.
2018-08-22T10:48:53 <the-t-in-rtf> If I find something I will write up a separate ticket and include it in the same small pull I\'m preparing for the linting errors.
2018-08-22T10:49:00 <Bosmon> I see a tap-reporting.js file
2018-08-22T10:49:30 <Bosmon> Also written by waharnum
2018-08-22T10:49:38 <Bosmon> So my expectation is that this feature is actually usedc
2018-08-22T10:50:06 <Bosmon> Ah, this is actually the impl for that
2018-08-22T10:50:22 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I\'m a little confused, as Testem does TAP natively.
2018-08-22T10:50:27 <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps it didn\'t at the time.
2018-08-22T10:50:48 <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps it\'s attempting to accumulate the testem results and somehow combine those.
2018-08-22T10:50:56 <Bosmon> I think it is more that our native QUnit impl doesn\'t do TAP natively
2018-08-22T10:51:37 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will just fix the linting error and confirm whether a combined TAP report is produced from a full test run.
2018-08-22T10:52:08 <Bosmon> Perhaps this configuration is executed by something within CI?
2018-08-22T10:53:03 <Bosmon> I guess all of this predates your "rollup" work by some way
2018-08-22T10:53:14 <Bosmon> Since as far as I see testem is only set up to execute the browser tests here
2018-08-22T10:53:22 <the-t-in-rtf> well, we can just look at a build and see what its report.tap looks like.
2018-08-22T10:54:05 <the-t-in-rtf> speaking of which, do you have a link to a build that ran after Gio\'s timeout fix?
2018-08-22T10:54:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to look at that anyway.
2018-08-22T10:55:51 <Bosmon> Perhaps this one?
2018-08-22T10:55:52 <Bosmon> https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pull-request/20/
2018-08-22T10:56:08 <Bosmon> Yes it looks like this is all done within CI
2018-08-22T10:56:16 <Bosmon> Given that the node tests are an entirely separate CI step
2018-08-22T10:56:48 <Bosmon> I assume that with your latest rollup work this can be rationalised
2018-08-22T10:56:49 <Bosmon> https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-node-tests/19/console
2018-08-22T10:56:59 <Bosmon> As well as eliminating the "content.match is not a function" cruft
2018-08-22T10:57:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I was already going to update to the latest gpii-grunt-lint-all in the pull.
2018-08-22T10:57:29 <Bosmon> Although as far as I can see, --tap is not used here
2018-08-22T10:58:30 <Bosmon> Hmm
2018-08-22T10:58:37 <Bosmon> Puzzlingly this build seems to use a very old variety of linting
2018-08-22T10:59:53 <Bosmon> The pull request doesn\'t seem stale
2018-08-22T10:59:57 <Bosmon> Yet we got this for code analysis: https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-code-analysis/19/console
2018-08-22T11:01:59 <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps the CI job itself is hard-coded to call individual checks.
2018-08-22T11:02:23 <Bosmon> But it just calls grunt lint
2018-08-22T11:02:30 <Bosmon> This one appears to be more modern: https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-code-analysis/21/console
2018-08-22T11:02:52 <the-t-in-rtf> what\'s the associated pull for any of these?
2018-08-22T11:03:14 <Bosmon> https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pull-request/
2018-08-22T11:03:21 <Bosmon> It appears this can be looked up from here
2018-08-22T11:03:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I would believe that many of the PRs in flight predate my work.
2018-08-22T11:04:36 <Bosmon> I guess they didn\'t get updated to master given they raised no conflicts
2018-08-22T11:04:37 <Bosmon> https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pull-request/22/
2018-08-22T11:05:04 <Bosmon> I\'m puzzled by how this overall build, labelled "#22", includes references to "builds" #20, #21 and #24
2018-08-22T11:05:45 <Bosmon> Similarly "#21" refers to #19, #20 and #23
2018-08-22T11:05:49 <Bosmon> I guess this is just a fact of life
2018-08-22T11:06:29 <Bosmon> I guess these "sub-builds" are drawn from a sequence of tasks rather than builds
2018-08-22T11:07:01 <Bosmon> At the risk of reprovoking an endless discussion, "Wasn\'t this all due to be moved over to buildKite"? : P
2018-08-22T11:09:41 <the-t-in-rtf> actually, no.
2018-08-22T11:09:55 <the-t-in-rtf> but it\'s a good one for the next arch meeting where Colin\'s around.
2018-08-22T11:10:05 <Bosmon> It wasn\'t due?
2018-08-22T11:10:11 <the-t-in-rtf> the intention is definitely to move away from the legacy Jenkins stuff.
2018-08-22T11:10:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Just not to BuildKite AFAIK?
2018-08-22T11:16:56 <Bosmon> I see
2018-08-22T11:17:10 <Bosmon> Isn\'t gtirloni as we speak working on some BuildKite stuff?
2018-08-22T11:17:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Not that I\'ve heard.

2018-08-22T12:25:41 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, is there a windows equivalent of "tee"?
2018-08-22T12:26:22 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, neat.  It\'s "tee"!
2018-08-22T12:26:30 <the-t-in-rtf> and powershell supposedly includes it.
2018-08-22T12:26:38 <stegru> ha
2018-08-22T12:27:16 <stegru> also, in "dos", you may be able to do: command > log | type log
2018-08-22T12:27:31 <stegru> the normal command prompt
2018-08-22T12:28:54 <stegru> no, doesn\'t work

2018-08-22T13:04:06 <the-t-in-rtf> tee works very nicely, and if you direct the output to a file in the repo you can tail it from the host
2018-08-22T13:10:53 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-08-22T13:12:00 <the-t-in-rtf> the only downside is it doesn\'t use utf8 encoding, so you have to fix that if you want to view the output on a Mac.

2018-08-22T13:28:55 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: are you waiting on any info regarding the build timeouts or is this PR ready to be merged https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/928
2018-08-22T13:29:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @Justin_o, my concern with the timeouts was actually that we might be including too many files and extending the lint time artificially.
2018-08-22T13:29:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I was able to verify that that wasn\'t the case.
2018-08-22T13:30:00 <the-t-in-rtf> So the new pull should be read to review.

2018-08-22T14:38:18 <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding this review comment - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/653#pullrequestreview-147754300, i cannot think of a better way to define "logonStateChangeHandler" grade for separate configs of all-in-local and untrusted, because comparing to all-in-local, "gpii.flowManager.untrusted" (https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-3193/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L31) is the only variant
2018-08-22T14:38:18 <cindyli> applied for untrusted config, so the handler grade was defined at the flowManager level. do you have ideas on a better way to distribute this handler grade?
2018-08-22T14:38:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - defining the separate grade is fine
2018-08-22T14:39:03 <Bosmon> I just meant that you should distribute it directly, rather than via an option which sits as a string
2018-08-22T14:39:12 <cindyli> ah, i see. thanks

2018-08-22T16:03:11 <the-t-in-rtf> nm.
2018-08-22T16:30:02 <gmoss> Bosmon: Justin_o and I paired a bit this morning while looking at FLUID-6300, and we kept digging until we found ourselves in the fluidResoures.js file, where we noticed something interesting about the fallback rules. It seemed like the code was building a list of all of the files it\'s meant to request (the resourceSpecs) and then tries to load all of them, in an order opposite to what one might expect from the fallback
2018-08-22T16:30:02 <gmoss> rules. It seemed, then, that the files are being loaded from least-specific to most and whatever is successfully loaded last is what is indeed used by the page. It seems like this should be doing something somewhat opposite to this, like attepting to load the full locale version (e.g. FR_CA, then falling back to a less complete locale (FR), then falling back to the full default locale (EN_CA), then to the more general
2018-08-22T16:30:02 <gmoss> default locale (EN), and finally to a non-localized version of the resource. Do you have any thoughts on the matter? Should efforts be made to "fix" this using a chain of promises or some other solution?
2018-08-22T16:32:33 <Bosmon> gmoss - sounds reasonable yes, although if you are going as far as this it might be worth just promisifying the entirety of fluidResources
2018-08-22T16:33:11 <Bosmon> This entire file has been condemned for a good long time
2018-08-22T16:33:49 <gmoss> yes indeed, "All contents of this file are DEPRECATED and no entry point should be considered a supported API" is plastered across the top, yet here I am depending on bits of it
2018-08-22T16:34:55 <Bosmon> gmoss - the order of loading of the files for the fallbacks will be essentially at random in the current implementation since all it does is pick up the pieces later in terms of seeing which one resolved
2018-08-22T16:35:03 <Bosmon> Which was all that was practical to express in the pre-promise days
2018-08-22T16:35:37 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry to say that I failed to independently reinvent the promise idiom back in 2008 when all of this was first implemented : P
2018-08-22T16:35:44 <the-t-in-rtf> A bit late for the discussion, but I finally found a bug report of the nyc issue: https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/741
2018-08-22T16:35:55 <gmoss> Bosmon: ah gotcha. well better late than never, I suppose :)
