2018-04-18T18:22:38 <cindyli> i believe session.model.preferences contains the data to be sent to Cloud, but you may have noticed that it misses the first level of ontology, for example "flat"
2018-04-18T18:23:26 <cindyli> Bosmon: shall i assume only "flat" object will be modified by PSP, not any other ontology views?
2018-04-18T18:25:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, we decided to do away with that level of containment in preferences files in a future pull
2018-04-18T18:25:21 <cindyli> great. thanks, Bosmon

2018-04-18T13:15:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I\'m rapidly hitting the limits of what I can do with infinite scrolling and a browser search.
2018-04-18T13:15:52 * clown joined the channel
2018-04-18T13:15:52 <the-t-in-rtf> I had to shovel through the pile to find the useful comments Georgi left me a few days ago.
2018-04-18T13:17:01 <the-t-in-rtf> BTW, I used fuse.js for a small project today, and was thinking again about indexing strategies for the docs site.
2018-04-18T13:17:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone experimented with the lunr docpad plugin?
2018-04-18T13:19:07 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hmm.. not that i know of, but jhung would be better to ask
2018-04-18T13:19:23 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, shoot, he\'s not online yet.
2018-04-18T13:19:24 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: there\'s also the chance that we make a switch to hugo, not sure how that would affect search
2018-04-18T13:20:13 <the-t-in-rtf> well, if we have control over the templates and some kind of hooks, many of the strategies for indexing static sites are doable.
2018-04-18T13:20:13 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-04-18T13:20:32 <Justin_o> would definitely love to have search on the docs site
2018-04-18T13:21:08 <the-t-in-rtf> by "hooks" I mean some part of the lifecycle where we get access to the rendered content, although I supposed we could render it ourselves separate for the purposes of indexing.
2018-04-18T13:21:27 <the-t-in-rtf> separately.
2018-04-18T13:22:37 <Justin_o> okay.. i think mostly it\'s been an issue of resources and time
2018-04-18T13:22:46 <Justin_o> that has delayed us from working on it more

2018-04-18T13:58:11 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I generally just use a Google Search confined to the docs site if I\'m having a really hard time finding something. but i recognize that\'s not super user-friendly
