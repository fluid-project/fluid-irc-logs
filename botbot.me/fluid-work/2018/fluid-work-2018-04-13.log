2018-04-13T11:37:56 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Hey, Tony! Today I spent some time investigating why the gpii-app tests were failing when the `npm run coverage` command was executed.
2018-04-13T11:40:04 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: In the html files of some of the components from the renderer process we need to refer to various files from the node_modules directory
2018-04-13T11:41:05 <georgitodorov> When the coverage report is being generated, the code of the project is copied to the `instrumented` folder and thus one additional level of nesting is created
2018-04-13T11:42:06 <georgitodorov> This means that the src of some of the script tags within some of the html files no longer point to a correct location
2018-04-13T11:43:50 <georgitodorov> For example, in order for the sequentialDialogs tests to succeed, the the errorDialog/index.html file\'s references need to be corrected. For example, "../../../node_modules/infusion/dist/infusion-all.js" should become "../../../../node_modules/infusion/dist/infusion-all.js"
2018-04-13T11:44:49 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Will it be possible not to create this additional `instrumented` directory and instead use the files as they are?
2018-04-13T11:45:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Not if you want to collect code coverage data.
2018-04-13T11:45:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Are these browser tests, or node?
2018-04-13T11:46:11 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: They are integration tests and include behavior both in the main and the renderer processes
2018-04-13T11:47:08 <georgitodorov> For example, in one of the tests the main process waits to be notified that something in the renderer has loaded. Which currently does not happen because of the invalid references
2018-04-13T11:47:21 <georgitodorov> And hence the test hangs
2018-04-13T11:47:43 <the-t-in-rtf> So, which package are you working in?
2018-04-13T11:47:45 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-app?
2018-04-13T11:48:09 <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because that one will have very particular requirements for code coverage.
2018-04-13T11:49:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume it\'s not infusion because otherwise you wouldn\'t be using node_modules otherwise.
2018-04-13T11:49:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, sorry, just scrolled up.
2018-04-13T11:52:01 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I am not sure that I understand what you mean
2018-04-13T11:52:27 <georgitodorov> We have code for the main and for the renderer process and they both use infusion
2018-04-13T11:52:53 <georgitodorov> In the latter we need to include infusion by referring to its javascript file from the node_modules directory
2018-04-13T11:53:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I only saw the last message at first, it wasn\'t clear which package you were using.
2018-04-13T11:53:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I get that now.
2018-04-13T11:53:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Our choices are to either make that more flexible, i.e. able to pull from either, or to only run the tests against instrumented code, or to clone node_modules as well during the instrumentation phase.
2018-04-13T11:53:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I can try the last one, which seems easiest.
2018-04-13T11:54:38 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks so much for looking into this, by the way.
2018-04-13T12:03:39 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Indeed the last option seems the easiest to implement. It may be a little slow to copy these but we can go with this for now.
2018-04-13T12:04:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Yeah, I was just thinking I\'d also need to explicitly clean up that content after the report is generated.
2018-04-13T12:04:42 <the-t-in-rtf> It makes a good case for keeping the coverage command separate from the standard "npm test" command.
2018-04-13T12:04:50 <the-t-in-rtf> we can choose to run the latter in CI.
2018-04-13T12:09:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I might need to find a faster copy method, the instrumentation phase is taking ages.
2018-04-13T12:24:59 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: We are using only the infusion module, so you copy only that module...
2018-04-13T12:25:25 <georgitodorov> And winstrap...but that is only css stuff which will not affect tests
2018-04-13T12:26:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, good idea.
2018-04-13T12:26:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I can try again with that shortly.

2018-04-13T14:51:21 <jhernandez> I just wanted to know your thoughts about https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2956
2018-04-13T14:51:46 <jhernandez> the "one way" key-in that Gregg has requested for the upcoming demo

2018-04-13T14:55:12 <Bosmon> Hi jhernandez - no, I have never had a conversation about this feature
2018-04-13T14:55:18 <jhernandez> ok
2018-04-13T14:55:27 <jhernandez> no prob

2018-04-13T14:55:42 <Bosmon> I can\'t immediately think how this would be implemented
2018-04-13T14:55:52 <jhernandez> no problem
2018-04-13T14:55:55 <Bosmon> Given we have made such efforts to make sure that the GPII doesn\'t corrupt the system
2018-04-13T14:56:12 <jhernandez> now we\'re attempting to exactly do that
2018-04-13T14:56:16 <jhernandez> ^
2018-04-13T14:56:18 <jhernandez> xDD
2018-04-13T14:56:25 <Bosmon> Right now you could implement it by logging in, and then killing the process :)
2018-04-13T14:56:40 <jhernandez> heh, yes
2018-04-13T14:56:44 <jhernandez> but I don\'t think it\'s a good idea
2018-04-13T14:56:58 <jhernandez> or yes .... ? who knows
2018-04-13T15:02:32 <jhernandez> well, let\'s think about it during the weekend, we can answer to Gregg\'s requirement and/or ask more questions on it next week
