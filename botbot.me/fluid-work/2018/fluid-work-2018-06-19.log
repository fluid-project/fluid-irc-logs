2018-06-19T15:14:57 <mrtyler> cindyli1: i\'d like to get back to debugging https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3103 this week when you have some time
2018-06-19T15:16:37 <michelled1> fluid-everyone: IDRC planning will start soon
2018-06-19T15:20:46 <cindyli1> thanks, mrtyler. is there anything you need from my side for debugging it?
2018-06-19T15:20:53 <mrtyler> yes
2018-06-19T15:21:16 <cindyli1> running "rake" to recreate the issue?
2018-06-19T15:21:26 <mrtyler> no
2018-06-19T15:22:18 <mrtyler> i\'ll explain when we can sit down and look at some things together
2018-06-19T15:24:04 <cindyli> mrtyler: i will be available anytime after 1pm eastern today. let me know when you have time to look at things together
2018-06-19T15:24:46 <mrtyler> hmm i have an interview at that time and then a lunch appointment, so perhaps we should try again tomorrow?
2018-06-19T15:25:02 <mrtyler> i\'ll ping you
2018-06-19T15:26:16 <cindyli> sure
2018-06-19T15:27:00 <mrtyler> thx cindy :)

2018-06-19T18:48:41 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: general infusion question here. If I have a model relay that has as its target an IoC reference to a grade that could potentially match multiple components, will a relay be hooked up to all such components? or is it only going to hook up to the first such component it finds?
2018-06-19T18:48:57 <gmoss> what I\'d like to have is the former
2018-06-19T18:50:31 <gmoss> See gist here: https://gist.github.com/BlueSlug/32f6fbb6ed2ffbd6ca85851904df13de
2018-06-19T18:50:46 <gmoss> I\'d like to match all possible ui subcomponents of {that}
2018-06-19T18:53:32 <simonjb> gmoss: I believe that it will find the first one. the search order is described here: https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCReferences.html#how-ioc-references-are-resolved
2018-06-19T18:54:10 <cindyli> gmoss: i don\'t know the exact answer to your question, but a safer way i can think of is to use a distributOptions to distribute the modelRelay block to all {ui} subcomponents and they all listener to the model change on {parent}.model.uiLanguage
2018-06-19T18:55:26 <gmoss> simonjb: thanks, I\'ll take a closer look! cindyli: that\'s a good idea, I hadn\'t considered that. I think I\'ve been avoiding the thought of using distributeOptions for fear of reducing readability /
2018-06-19T18:56:10 <gmoss> I do often forget that distOpts can be used to inject more complex things like listeners and relays
2018-06-19T18:56:11 <cindyli> distributeOptions is helpful especially when dealing with multiple components in the same type
2018-06-19T18:56:33 <simonjb> gmoss: here\'s the section of the docs on IoCSS selectors (to use with distributeOptions) https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCSS.html#iocss-selectors

2018-06-19T20:37:13 <Bosmon> simonjb, gmoss - options distributions strike all matching components
2018-06-19T20:40:05 <gmoss> Bosmon simonjb: thank you for the help! I\'ve got the relay inserted into all the components I was targeting, though I\'m experiencing some unintended consequences. still, much appreciated and my question has been answered :)
2018-06-19T20:40:41 * kasper has quit
2018-06-19T20:40:55 <Bosmon> gmoss - your target selector is written wrongly though
2018-06-19T20:41:03 <Bosmon> As written it will only match siblings and parents, rather than children
2018-06-19T20:41:16 <Bosmon> I guess you meant to write {that ui} although I suggest you give a more fully qualified name to "ui"
2018-06-19T20:41:19 <gmoss> Bosmon: yes, I have set it to target: "{that ui}.options.modelRelay"
2018-06-19T20:41:26 <Bosmon> ok
2018-06-19T20:41:47 <gmoss> previously that relay lived on {that}s, not {ui}s
2018-06-19T20:42:37 <Bosmon> Normal kinds of recommendations about variable naming apply here - if something matches in a totally unconstrained scope, it is better to give it a globally qualified name - that is, a full grade name
2018-06-19T20:42:47 <gmoss> Bosmon: following your advice, I\'ve adjusted the target to "{that sjrk.storyTelling.ui}.options.modelRelay"
2018-06-19T20:45:25 <Bosmon> gmoss - awesome!
2018-06-19T20:45:37 <Bosmon> Thanks for the lift, btw :)
2018-06-19T20:45:45 <gmoss> haha no worries at all :)

2018-06-19T21:01:25 <Bosmon> gmoss - you may be interested in comparing with some (rather more elaborate) work done by the Astea team, dandimitrov_ and georgitodorov for the GPII app -
2018-06-19T21:01:26 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/common/messageBundles.js#L156
2018-06-19T21:01:42 <Bosmon> This work needs to be streamlined a bit, but shows the skeleton of the basic approach
2018-06-19T21:02:14 <Bosmon> It\'s a little over-elaborate in that the relay is done manually and computes all the message keys from scratch
2018-06-19T21:02:24 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/common/messageBundles.js#L293
2018-06-19T21:02:43 <Bosmon> But after we dust this down a bit it should hopefully form the basis of a framework-wide facility
