2018-05-29T11:29:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.
2018-05-29T11:29:36 <the-t-in-rtf> We\'re due to meet shortly.
2018-05-29T11:29:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Just seeing if @sgithens, @Bosmon, etc. are around.
2018-05-29T11:30:52 <Bosmon> I am one of those
2018-05-29T11:38:16 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-05-29T11:39:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, just waiting for signs of life from HENS.
2018-05-29T11:40:03 <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf: I\xe2\x80\x99m also available
2018-05-29T11:40:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, great, let\'s hop on Skype.
2018-05-29T11:40:19 <the-t-in-rtf> We can start chatting while we wait.

2018-05-29T12:16:32 <javjarfer[m]> hi Bosmon ! I have some bad news about acceptanceTests and probably high-contrast I need to trace down this... but could be likely be that
2018-05-29T12:17:18 <Bosmon> Hey there javjarfer[m]
2018-05-29T12:17:21 <Bosmon> What have you discovered?
2018-05-29T12:17:25 <javjarfer[m]> after previously closing the past issue, because research established that could be timing related, I started working with a more recent branch version
2018-05-29T12:17:55 <javjarfer[m]> and tests keep failing (crashing locally) so I re-instanced my dev environment from scrach
2018-05-29T12:18:23 <javjarfer[m]> and... keep failing, and it result that tests have been silently failing in CI too
2018-05-29T12:18:37 * javjarfer[m] sent a long message: javjarfer[m]_2018-05-29_12:18:34.txt <https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/TIWlmzrAWEdtDyXzCMeTmMgR>
2018-05-29T12:19:03 <javjarfer[m]> from last 8 execution those one I have pasted, ended in a silent fail due to application crash
2018-05-29T12:19:37 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - well, that\'s pretty terrible
2018-05-29T12:36:13 <Bosmon> Have you been able to determine which is the most recently valid run?
2018-05-29T13:02:48 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov, I\'ve filed https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3088 for QSS core issues
2018-05-29T13:02:55 <Bosmon> And added it to our agenda for the F2F
2018-05-29T13:03:53 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: great, thank you
2018-05-29T13:05:13 <dandimitrov> The QSS will also require some i18n-ing more precisely for the qss tooltips

2018-05-29T13:19:00 <gtirloni> javjarfer[m]: looks like the DoIt client crashed, right?
2018-05-29T13:19:45 <gtirloni> it was a necessary evil at the time, to run commands inside the desktop session instead of getting a new session every time you login to Windows
2018-05-29T13:19:54 <gtirloni> but there might be something else that could be used now
2018-05-29T13:25:34 <clown> gtirloni, javjarfer[m]:  a funny:  I read "Dolt" client, spelled Dee oh el tee.
2018-05-29T13:26:34 <gtirloni> haha, never heard that word before but now i know it\'s an insult.. poor DoIT client :)

2018-05-29T17:04:04 <avtar1> gmoss: any idea if a sjrk meeting is taking place today?
2018-05-29T17:04:52 <sgithens> Bosmon: What actually fires this event?  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerRequests.js#L158
2018-05-29T17:05:10 <gmoss> avtar1: James just connected briefly, but there\'s no sign of anyone else
2018-05-29T17:05:12 <sgithens> I\'m grepping through and trying to figure where it\'s actually initiated
2018-05-29T17:05:17 <gmoss> avtar1: so we\'ve decided to adjourd
2018-05-29T17:05:23 <gmoss> *adjourn
2018-05-29T17:05:30 <avtar1> ok
2018-05-29T17:05:30 <avtar1> thanks
2018-05-29T17:05:40 <gmoss> (i think my french brain was about to start typing "aujourdhui"
2018-05-29T17:05:44 <gmoss> )
2018-05-29T17:06:15 <gmoss> avtar1: we may try to reschedule for next week, so we can get as fresh a report as possible from Colombia
2018-05-29T17:06:46 <avtar1> that sounds good
2018-05-29T17:09:49 <Bosmon> sgithens - it is fired as a result of its own boiling
2018-05-29T17:10:16 <Bosmon> https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/EventInjectionAndBoiling.html#boiling-multiple-events
2018-05-29T17:27:23 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-05-29T17:42:46 <sgithens> Oh, I think I had the boiling completely backwards.  I thought that when onReadyToMatch was fired, it would fire it\'s subevents and wait for them to complete... or something.  So in this case, all three of the events need to fire of some other cause, and _then_ onReadyToMatch is fired?
2018-05-29T17:44:39 <sgithens> Bosmon
2018-05-29T17:45:03 <Bosmon> sgithens - that is it
2018-05-29T17:45:31 <Bosmon> boiled events are all "relays"
2018-05-29T17:47:01 <sgithens> Bosmon: So, what happens if like, onPreferences fired 3 or 4 or times, and then maybe onDeviceContext fires, and then onPreferences fires again, and then finally onSolutions. Is it just queuing them all up in the background? and then would it use the payload from the most recent onPreferneces event, or from the first one that fired like 5 times back?
2018-05-29T17:47:39 <sgithens> ( I realize tha tmay not be possible in this component, but in theory, for a multi boiled event, if something like that happened )
2018-05-29T17:48:09 <Bosmon> It would use the payload from the most recent firing
2018-05-29T17:48:16 <Bosmon> They don\'t queue
2018-05-29T17:48:43 <sgithens> Cool, so it just keeps filling and refilling the events slots, and soon as it\'s full, it takes off
2018-05-29T17:48:50 <Bosmon> As soon as each event has fired once, you get the most recent payload of each firing, and the machine resets
2018-05-29T17:49:35 <sgithens> All 3 of those events have to fire, and on the final one, it is invoked with the most recent payloads of each
2018-05-29T17:49:47 <Bosmon> ALL THREE
2018-05-29T17:49:51 <Bosmon> AND THEN IT IS INVOKED
2018-05-29T17:50:07 <Bosmon> THE MACHINE THEN RESETS
2018-05-29T17:51:05 <sgithens> interesting
2018-05-29T17:51:23 <Bosmon> It\'s not an enormously regular system, but it is probably fairly unsurprising
2018-05-29T17:51:54 <Bosmon> We can\'t really do much better until we have the IMMUTABLE REVOLUTION
2018-05-29T17:51:58 <sgithens> Yeah, it is neat.  DOes anybody else aggregate events like this to fire another event, or is it an infusion innovation?
2018-05-29T17:52:09 <sgithens> without manually like chaining them up
2018-05-29T17:52:17 <Bosmon> I\'m not aware of any particular prior art on this
2018-05-29T17:52:24 <Bosmon> Although it is a fairly well-known FRP primitive
2018-05-29T17:52:34 <Bosmon> But we didn\'t know anything about FRP at this point
2018-05-29T17:52:38 <Bosmon> This is a pretty ancient machine
2018-05-29T17:53:22 <Bosmon> https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/#join-patterns-as-a-chemical-machine
2018-05-29T17:53:38 <sgithens> huh
2018-05-29T17:54:02 <sgithens> this is pretty edifying
2018-05-29T17:54:31 <sgithens> this is all in core infusion right along the rest of the event stuff
2018-05-29T17:54:38 <Bosmon> Yes it is
2018-05-29T17:56:26 <sgithens> Did you say it\'s like a model relay?  So that there is tracking of all the dependent events on an object somewhere?
2018-05-29T17:56:46 <Bosmon> No, this is ancient stuff
2018-05-29T17:56:50 <Bosmon> Sadly the machine is private
2018-05-29T18:01:30 <Bosmon> It\'s just like a "relay" in general
2018-05-29T18:01:46 <Bosmon> In that firings of source events are relayed onto firings of derived events
