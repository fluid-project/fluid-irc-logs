2018-04-26T18:43:20 <sgithens> cindyli1: Do you think we could populate the `name` field on the safes as well in your db populate script?
2018-04-26T18:43:32 <sgithens> for prefsSafe-alice you could just set the name to alice
2018-04-26T18:43:59 <sgithens> I also ahve a few couch views I\'m wondering if maybe we could sneak in to 2630.  They aren\'t anything major
2018-04-26T18:47:09 * dandimitrov_ has quit
2018-04-26T18:47:17 <cindyli1> sgithens: yes, i can set the "name" field to be same as the file name
2018-04-26T18:47:29 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2018-04-26T18:47:41 <sgithens> awesome thanks
2018-04-26T18:47:52 <sgithens> it just makes the demo data look a bit more realistic
2018-04-26T18:48:06 <cindyli> but keep in mind when these data eventually get loaded as snapsets into production, they will be read only snapsets
2018-04-26T18:48:23 <cindyli> they are right now set to "user" type in the conversion script
2018-04-26T18:48:28 <sgithens> ok
2018-04-26T18:48:36 <cindyli> i was wondering the other day if i should change them to "snapset" now
2018-04-26T18:49:05 <sgithens> for now the views I have in the personal cloudsafes won\'t let you log in if the password is null as well... but it\'s still just a demo/prototype
2018-04-26T18:49:11 <cindyli> but once making that change, we don\'t have test or demo data to show the update of preferences
2018-04-26T18:49:29 <cindyli> ok
2018-04-26T18:49:33 <sgithens> but I have created a few views for creating anonymous safes, and logging in as them
2018-04-26T18:49:39 <cindyli> sgithens: can you show me your views too?
2018-04-26T18:49:50 <cindyli> the ones you wanna include in 2630
2018-04-26T18:50:01 <sgithens> oh yeah those
2018-04-26T18:50:08 <sgithens> they are pretty simple at the moment, let me paste them
2018-04-26T18:50:11 <sgithens> the couchdb views
2018-04-26T18:50:18 <sgithens> (not the handlebars/web views)
2018-04-26T18:51:56 <sgithens> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/TlJvSoJy/
2018-04-26T18:53:26 <sgithens> cindyli: Have you looked at all yet on creating unique emails or userids for people?  From my really only like 10 minutes of looking, it seems like really hte _id field is the only thing that is guaranteed to be unique, so I wonder if that\'s what people would have to log in with.
2018-04-26T18:54:01 <sgithens> For this quick prototype I\'m actually using the name field but realize it may need to be id
2018-04-26T18:54:13 <cindyli> sgithens: those views are not related to what should be done in 2630
2018-04-26T18:54:28 <sgithens> cindyli: They totally aren\'t
2018-04-26T18:54:44 <sgithens> I can create a branch off your branch
2018-04-26T18:54:56 <cindyli> cindyli: that sounds a better approach
2018-04-26T18:55:27 <cindyli> shouldn\'t it be users themselves to pick names they\'d like to login?
2018-04-26T18:55:54 <cindyli> or if they\'ve provided their emails, emails can be used as the login name too
2018-04-26T18:55:58 <sgithens> it should
2018-04-26T18:56:15 <sgithens> what I\'m saying is, have you figured out how to keep a field in a document unique?
2018-04-26T18:56:25 <cindyli> uuid
2018-04-26T18:56:27 <sgithens> other than _id
2018-04-26T18:57:35 <sgithens> you can create the doc with any _id we want, so would we just check to see if it exists, and if not they could create it with that _id?
2018-04-26T18:58:42 <cindyli> yes, you can do that. or couchdb can auto generate an _id for you, which is also an uuid
2018-04-26T18:59:05 <cindyli> if you don\'t provide _id value when posting a document
2018-04-26T19:00:15 <sgithens> right

2018-04-26T13:01:20 <yuriy__> Bosmon: Hi, Antranig, there is another thing I wanted to run by you, which we may need to discuss again on the status call - the changes to the snapset data. So far, the only piece of information that we have identified as necessary to be received from the channel are the user\xe2\x80\x99s preferences on whether a sound should be played when the PSP panel is opened and whether clicking outside the panel should close it or not. I wanted to see if you think thi
2018-04-26T13:01:20 <yuriy__> s is something can be done relatively easily and perhaps more importantly if there is currently a place, from where core can get this information.

2018-04-26T14:09:31 <cindyli> Bosmon, simonjb, I\'m restoring the prefs server back to a kettle server. One extra feature in GPII-2630 branch with prefs server PUT request handler that\'s for updating preferences is, it now accepts a "mergePrefs" flag, which indicates if the incoming preferences should override or be merged with existing preferences.
2018-04-26T14:09:34 * jeevan_ joined the channel
2018-04-26T14:09:56 <cindyli> this is because PSP will send a subset of preferences to the cloud
2018-04-26T14:10:16 <cindyli> and gpii.flowmanager.save will send in full block of preferences
2018-04-26T14:10:46 <cindyli> so i wonder, if it makes sense to have an extra request parameter "merge" for PUT requests
2018-04-26T14:11:37 <cindyli> PUT /preferences/:token[?view=:view&merge=:boolean]
2018-04-26T14:11:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - it sounds reasonable to me
2018-04-26T14:11:47 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2018-04-26T14:11:53 <simonjb> cindyli: in your correct, non-kettle-server, implementation the merge flag is an invoker parameter?
2018-04-26T14:12:07 <simonjb> sorry
2018-04-26T14:12:15 <cindyli> yes, that\'s true
2018-04-26T14:12:17 <simonjb> correct should have been current
2018-04-26T14:12:47 <simonjb> ok
2018-04-26T14:13:30 <cindyli> with reverting back to a kettle server, these invoker parameters will be from the request handler - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630-temp/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesPutHandler.js#L26-L27

2018-04-26T14:24:53 <Justin_o> gtirloni: I\'ve been doing a lot of debugging of tests and have been using the vagrant, testem setup. However, I\'m finding that after a while chrome either takes very long to startup or just hangs at that step. I\'ve been killing the vm and starting over when this happens, but figured I\'d mention it.
2018-04-26T14:29:43 <gtirloni> Justin_o: Hi! Could you guess how much time it starts taking to start? When you kill it, do you just `start/stop/reload` or do you run `vagrant destroy/create`?
2018-04-26T14:34:26 <Justin_o> gtirloni: on the order of minutes at least, there was once yesterday that i walked away from my desk for a bit and came back to it hanging, so that might have been 10s of minutes.. but not sure
2018-04-26T14:34:48 <Justin_o> gtirloni: usually i just kill the process in the terminal and then vagrant destroy/create
2018-04-26T14:38:58 <gtirloni> interesting. when it happens again, please try `vagrant reload`.. that should just reboot the machine and keep the files intact. then if it continues happening, we know something on disk could be looked at. you could also capture the output of `vagrant ssh -c "uptime; df -h; ps aux"`
2018-04-26T14:39:17 <gtirloni> that should show enough information for debugging
2018-04-26T14:40:14 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, i\'ll let you know if i encounter it again
