2018-02-27T14:18:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s because of the issue with panelIndex i believe
2018-02-27T14:18:28 <Justin_o> the build test failure that is
2018-02-27T14:18:43 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, I found it now in the MatchMakerUtilities ...
2018-02-27T14:18:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: If i put things back to comment out the panel index and not exclude init, the tests should pass again
2018-02-27T14:19:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok - if you could do that and merge up the conflicts, I imagine we should be good to go
2018-02-27T14:20:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, will do
2018-02-27T14:20:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon, cool, and sorry - should\'ve pointed you to that - thought it was a more a general question you asked
2018-02-27T14:21:28 <Bosmon> Well it sort of was
2018-02-27T14:21:34 <kasparnet> Bosmon, if it is helpful, we could do a call and I could talk you through the changes I\'ve made
2018-02-27T14:21:36 <Bosmon> Seeing how they are generated is a great clue as to what they are
2018-02-27T14:21:44 <kasparnet> haha, indeed
2018-02-27T14:21:44 <Bosmon> But I was just starting to read the massive diff from the top : P
2018-02-27T14:22:07 <kasparnet> some updated documentation to go along with it would help as well
2018-02-27T14:22:13 <Bosmon> Overall these changes seem to make a lot of sense
2018-02-27T14:22:36 <kasparnet> but that\'ll be coming in over this evening
2018-02-27T14:23:16 <Bosmon> Very interesting to now have a new "isRunning" rootAction in the lifecycleManager.....
2018-02-27T14:24:46 <kasparnet> yeah... the general idea though is that it should not contain specific actions, but rather just reference a launchHandler (and trigger it\'s "get" method)
2018-02-27T14:26:33 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I see that there is one test in our most recent PR that is failing:
2018-02-27T14:26:41 <georgitodorov> jq: FAIL: Module "Testing Pouch Manager" Test name "Testing the load and the reset processes" - Message: The response should have a reasonable status code - at sequence position 18 of 20
2018-02-27T14:26:53 <georgitodorov> jq: Expected: 200
2018-02-27T14:26:58 <georgitodorov> jq: Actual: 500
2018-02-27T14:27:24 <georgitodorov> Any idea what might be causing this?
2018-02-27T14:27:39 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - not directly, no
2018-02-27T14:27:46 <Bosmon> jhernandez and the-t-in-rtf between them might have an idea
2018-02-27T14:28:00 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - have you merged your branch up with any of the recent dependency updates?
2018-02-27T14:30:03 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Yes, we have the latest changes
2018-02-27T14:30:18 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - this might be part of the problem : P
2018-02-27T14:30:40 * clown has quit
2018-02-27T14:31:06 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hmm, we had those changes in the survey branch that you merged yesterday and did not observe this failing behavior there
2018-02-27T14:31:29 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-02-27T14:31:30 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - it might well be some kind of random, low probability failure
2018-02-27T14:31:33 <georgitodorov> changes --> most recent dependencies
2018-02-27T14:32:13 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Can you trigger the build again to see if it will happen again?
2018-02-27T14:32:18 <Bosmon> sure
2018-02-27T14:36:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/867 is ready for review again
2018-02-27T14:37:47 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - we\'re looking at https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/174/consoleFull
2018-02-27T14:37:56 <Bosmon> And have received an odd failure from pouchdb -
2018-02-27T14:38:06 <Bosmon> "{\\"error\\":\\"OpenError\\",\\"reason\\":\\"IO error: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\vagrant\\\\\\\\AppData\\\\\\\\Local\\\\\\\\Temp/pouchManagerTests\\\\\\\\auth-mrview-ac9eefd3422f906a613ecb54cb900916/MANIFEST-000001: The system cannot find the file specified.\\\\r\\\
\\"}\
""
2018-02-27T14:38:13 <Bosmon> Does this seem reminiscent of anything?
2018-02-27T14:38:28 <Bosmon> Also - we should make an appointment with the Astea team to start talking about I18N
2018-02-27T14:38:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, taking a look
2018-02-27T14:38:53 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - we\'re running the tests again to see how probable the failure is
2018-02-27T14:40:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2018-02-27T14:41:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  could you also look at this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/870
2018-02-27T14:41:10 <Justin_o> it should be pretty quick
2018-02-27T14:43:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess I still need some help to understand the situation here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/867/files#diff-517444290dbc154e34155e9362c9b7c3R148
2018-02-27T14:44:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - pull 870 looks good, I\'ll merge it once the CI finishes
2018-02-27T14:47:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  because it is a remote model component it needs to specify which portions of the model need to be tracked for remote storage. This is defined by relaying it to the local model path.
2018-02-27T14:48:21 <Justin_o> then updates in the "remote" model are coordinated with it

2018-02-27T12:26:03 <kasparnet> but that also means that my last day is theoretically tomorrow
2018-02-27T12:26:45 <kasparnet> but while my changes to the MM pull will most definitely be done by then, there is no chance it\'ll be reviewed/addressed, etc
2018-02-27T12:27:03 <kasparnet> so I\'m expecting to be working a full thursday as well
2018-02-27T12:27:38 <kasparnet> (and then whatever followup there is on that branch, and on passing on my MM knowledge
2018-02-27T12:28:16 <kasparnet> urgh, need to go afk for a bit, will be back in 30\'
2018-02-27T12:32:42 * kasparnet has quit
2018-02-27T12:40:01 <jhernandez> Bosmon: hey there
2018-02-27T12:40:20 <Bosmon> Hey jhernandez
2018-02-27T12:40:39 <jhernandez> FYI, gpii-windows aand gpii-app are ready to go
2018-02-27T12:40:47 <Bosmon> Awesome, I was just taking a look
2018-02-27T12:41:48 <jhernandez> there\'s one "thing"
2018-02-27T12:41:57 <Bosmon> I wonder if what we say in our readme is still true
2018-02-27T12:42:05 <Bosmon> "Note that tests and function involving the High Contrast setting will fail on all current versions of Windows (including Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8 SP2) unless the following hotfix from Microsoft is applied: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2516889"
2018-02-27T12:42:44 <jhernandez> oh wow, that\'s been there for long ... and yes, I\'d say that it\'s not the case anymore
2018-02-27T12:43:10 <jhernandez> so, wrt the "thing"
2018-02-27T12:43:21 <Bosmon> HERE\'S THE THING, RIGHT
2018-02-27T12:43:33 <jhernandez> in gpii-app, we\'re not updating the version of node in the vm
2018-02-27T12:44:19 <jhernandez> because we\'re still using the provisioning scripts from the hst-2017 branch
2018-02-27T12:44:39 <jhernandez> that\'s why I opened https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/165
2018-02-27T12:47:27 <jhernandez> also, and in relation to this, it seems that there\'s a bug in npm 5.6.0 that affects us, but *only* when running the code in electron (gpii-app)
2018-02-27T12:49:17 <jhernandez> well, I guess that the problem it\'s a combination of both npm and electron
2018-02-27T12:49:47 <jhernandez> an it\'s very similar to this one https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8862
2018-02-27T12:59:37 <jhernandez> okay, I can get rid of the problem by replacing app.quit with gpii.exit here https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/main.js#L29
2018-02-27T13:03:30 <jhernandez> heh, but I\'m still getting other module resolution problems
2018-02-27T13:15:08 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-02-27T13:17:38 <Bosmon> jhernandez - that\'s interesting
2018-02-27T13:17:40 <Bosmon> What do you see?
2018-02-27T13:19:40 <jhernandez> well, I\'m seeing lots of things ... problems to resolve pspWindow, problems when loading the leveldown module

2018-02-27T13:23:06 <Bosmon> jhernandez - what problems?
2018-02-27T13:25:26 <jhernandez> "message": "Error: Error: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.\\r\
\\\\\\\\?\\\\UNC\\\\vboxsrv\\\\vagrant\\\
ode_modules\\\\leveldown\\\\build\\\\Release\\\\leveldown.node: unable to import leveldown"
2018-02-27T13:25:35 <Bosmon> oh, ok
2018-02-27T13:25:40 <jhernandez> okay, looks like I had node 64bit installed
2018-02-27T13:25:44 <Bosmon> yes
2018-02-27T13:31:10 * yuriy joined the channel
2018-02-27T13:31:44 <jhernandez> okay, installed node 32, re-npm installed, it starts, it doesn\'t explode, I\'m now running the tests

2018-02-27T13:47:41 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I\'m seeing that you merged windows
2018-02-27T13:47:43 <jhernandez> wee!!!
2018-02-27T13:47:52 <jhernandez> but hold a sec for the gpii-app one
2018-02-27T13:48:12 <jhernandez> I have a small adjustment to push
2018-02-27T13:48:25 <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes
2018-02-27T13:48:34 <Bosmon> Shall I roll a dev release of windows for you to bid to?
2018-02-27T13:48:35 <Bosmon> bind
2018-02-27T13:48:47 * yuriy__ has quit
2018-02-27T13:50:09 <Bosmon> jhernandez - Just looking at your HST pull
2018-02-27T13:50:13 <Bosmon> I barely remember the "debug logger"
2018-02-27T13:51:12 <Bosmon> I\'m glad we can skip the proximity listener
2018-02-27T13:51:19 <Bosmon> What do we want from the provisioning scripts?
2018-02-27T13:51:53 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-02-27T13:54:02 <jhernandez> Bosmon: sure, roll a windows dev release so I can use in my gpii-app pr
2018-02-27T13:54:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'ve added a comment about my exploration of combing onFetch/afterFetch and onWrite/afterWrite https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/867#discussion_r170927775
2018-02-27T13:54:36 <Justin_o> the main issue is with how the payloads are handled in
2018-02-27T13:54:37 <Bosmon> jhernandez - it\'s 0.3.0-dev.20180227T134532Z.0f86b5c
2018-02-27T13:55:17 * yuriy has quit
2018-02-27T13:55:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - somehow the link doesn\'t resolve - is it to an outdated bit of diff?
2018-02-27T13:55:30 <Bosmon> Perhaps it could go into the JIRA
2018-02-27T13:56:09 <jhernandez> Bosmon: super fast! thanks!
2018-02-27T13:56:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, it is to an outdated change
2018-02-27T13:57:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s the link to the JIRA comment https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6209?focusedCommentId=38840&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-38840
2018-02-27T13:57:59 <jhernandez> Bosmon: wrt the provisioning scripts, the ones that are in hst-2017 can be used to provision both windows and gpii-app
2018-02-27T13:58:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, that\'s great thanks
2018-02-27T13:58:43 <kasparnet> Bosmon, I got all tests working and improvements in now for the MM - and created a new pull request for the work https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/592. This contains the */enabled improvements, liveness support and inferred lifecycle actions (i.e for update, stop, start, configure, etc.) when they are not explicitly given. It does *NOT* contain the removal of support for non-registered solution settings
2018-02-27T13:58:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it seems you have a test failure in buildkite?
2018-02-27T13:58:56 <kasparnet> still need to update a lot of the documentation for this stuff
2018-02-27T13:58:58 <jhernandez> Bosmon: gpii-app pulls some provisioning scripts from the windows repo, this way we don\'t duplicate provisioning stuff
2018-02-27T13:59:19 <Bosmon> jhernandez - ok, that\'s good
2018-02-27T13:59:34 * kasparnet is crossing his fingers that the tests actually pass in CI
2018-02-27T13:59:38 <Bosmon> So you\'re planning to make a mini-pull out of that to just split off the provisioning stuff from gpii-windows?
2018-02-27T14:00:10 <Bosmon> kasparnet - that\'s great, taking a look now
2018-02-27T14:00:40 * yuriy joined the channel
2018-02-27T14:00:53 <Bosmon> Wow
2018-02-27T14:00:57 <Bosmon> What a mega-work to go out on
2018-02-27T14:01:06 <Bosmon> 62 commits, and 179 files changed : P
2018-02-27T14:02:00 <Bosmon> kasparnet - what in mike is "specialPreferences"?
2018-02-27T14:02:44 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yup, the idea is to create a mini pull request with the provisioning stuff and the debug logger if we want it
2018-02-27T14:03:50 * yuriy__ has quit
2018-02-27T14:04:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon, yeah, that\'s the /enabled ones
2018-02-27T14:04:50 <kasparnet> I figured there might be other types later on, so used "special" instead of enabled, but wasn\'t really sure
2018-02-27T14:06:32 <kasparnet> in general, I do feel my implementation of the */enabled support is a bit sub-optimal, but the alternative as far as I could tell was to do a lot of searching for the terms in capabilities and preferences on several different occasions, so I ended up adding all those helper structures to pass around in the MM mega payload
2018-02-27T14:09:58 * grrrero joined the channel
2018-02-27T14:10:02 <kasparnet> yeah, there are quite a few filechanges, but at least a lot of them are just naming changes in NP sets
2018-02-27T14:10:22 * jessm joined the channel
2018-02-27T14:12:11 <jhernandez> Bosmon: btw, wrt the mini pull request, if you prefer, I can make one with the provisioning stuff and stegru can create another one for the debug logger
2018-02-27T14:12:30 <stegru> ok
2018-02-27T14:13:27 * jhernandez leaving now - brb in ~1 hour
2018-02-27T14:16:06 <Bosmon> jhernandez - sounds great
