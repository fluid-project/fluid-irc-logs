b'2018-10-11T15:31:49 <alanharnum> yes, that\'s a permanent change to the underlying Hugo build container that we\'ll leave in pace
2018-10-11T15:31:57 <simonjb> though it\'s a little surprising that this error isn\'t reported without the verbose flag
2018-10-11T15:32:05 <simonjb> but great that we found it
2018-10-11T15:32:08 <simonjb> thanks!
2018-10-11T15:32:10 <alanharnum> yes, i\'m surprised that didn\'t cause a non-zero exit code
2018-10-11T15:32:32 <alanharnum> i\'d expect "I couldn\'t render this page because of a potential infinite loop, so I didn\'t" to result in that
2018-10-11T15:33:08 <simonjb> yes, silently failing is bad behaviour
2018-10-11T15:39:33 <alanharnum> simonjb: looks like other people have had similar issues: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/4841
2018-10-11T15:39:39 <alanharnum> in CI vs. local environments

2018-10-11T15:40:44 <simonjb> alanharnum: yeah, not surprising that others would hit this -- but really odd that they don\'t surface this as an error
2018-10-11T15:41:19 <simonjb> hopefully a future version will make it an error
2018-10-11T15:42:55 <alanharnum> simonjb: some discussion about why they warn instead of error out here: https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/malformed-shortcode-triggers-warning-instead-of-error/10274
2018-10-11T15:44:00 <alanharnum> actually reading it more closely it\'s the opposite issue :p
2018-10-11T15:54:13 <alanharnum> simonjb: looks like that worked - https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/ideas/hackathon/ renders and no warnings
2018-10-11T15:54:48 <simonjb> alanharnum: awesome
2018-10-11T15:56:06 <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru: update on the node-ffi replacement - not as easy as just replacing the dep with ffi-napi :/
2018-10-11T15:56:20 <stegru> just fix it, javi
2018-10-11T15:56:26 <stegru> ;)
2018-10-11T15:56:38 <jhernandez> had some probleems with the node-gyp rebuild step, but already sorted them out
2018-10-11T15:56:46 <stegru> ok
2018-10-11T15:57:40 <jhernandez> but after that, I run the tests and after some tests start running the process bails out with no information whatsoever
2018-10-11T15:57:45 <stegru> just so I understand... the napi version is the same API (that we use), but it uses a different add-on API? one that doesn\'t change through upgrades?
2018-10-11T15:58:16 * jhernandez nods
2018-10-11T15:58:30 <jhernandez> I\'m not getting any segfault, error or the like
2018-10-11T15:58:45 <jhernandez> looks like a "lost thread" :)
2018-10-11T15:58:51 <stegru> oh
2018-10-11T15:58:57 <jhernandez> poor thread
2018-10-11T15:59:00 <jhernandez> :_(
2018-10-11T15:59:32 <stegru> can you share what you are seeing?
2018-10-11T15:59:33 <jhernandez> stegru: do you want me to push it into a branch so you can give it a try?
2018-10-11T15:59:45 <stegru> yes
2018-10-11T15:59:47 <jhernandez> I can also show you if you want
2018-10-11T16:02:04 <stegru> I\'m worried that one of the function calls accidentally relies on a random piece of memory that node-ffi sets up
2018-10-11T16:02:43 <stegru> well, i\'m not "worried"
2018-10-11T16:02:55 <simonjb> alanharnum: I think we can mark INFRA-222 as resolved now (I don\'t have permission)

2018-10-11T16:03:17 <simonjb> awesome
2018-10-11T16:03:20 <jhernandez> stegru: use my windows/GPII-3438-ffi-napi branch
2018-10-11T16:03:49 <simonjb> alanharnum: this is the commit https://github.com/inclusive-design/website-cities/commit/66643b5d92255a0f3dc3d51802fbcbd2dace21d2
2018-10-11T16:06:43 <stegru> it breaks just after the resolution, jhernandez
2018-10-11T16:07:42 <simonjb> alanharnum: I think default is 10 seconds
2018-10-11T16:08:00 <alanharnum> simonjb: ah, yes, that\'s right

2018-10-11T07:57:43 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, don\'t know if you had a chance to pick up the windows linting stuff from my branch, but I reviewed it again and tailored it to better match the repo contents.
2018-10-11T07:57:46 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/windows/tree/this-is-fine
2018-10-11T07:58:39 <the-t-in-rtf> There are no checks for the ps1 files and other windows-specific stuff, not even trailing CR checks
2018-10-11T07:58:46 <the-t-in-rtf> but they never had linting, so that\'s nothing new.
2018-10-11T08:53:20 <stegru> ok thanks the-t-in-rtf
2018-10-11T08:54:01 <the-t-in-rtf> seems like it\'s mostly trailing spaces, you could probably fix 90% of it with a single regexp find and replace

2018-10-11T09:41:52 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m alphabetising the damned generic terms.
2018-10-11T09:42:02 <the-t-in-rtf> (in flat.json)
2018-10-11T09:42:49 <the-t-in-rtf> 5
2018-10-11T09:43:46 <the-t-in-rtf> it was like each new round of things had been fired at the file from a cannon
2018-10-11T09:45:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'
2018-10-11T09:46:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m also alphabetising the installed solutions test data.
2018-10-11T09:46:16 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s bonkers trying to find an entry there.
2018-10-11T09:59:39 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, just to follow up on yesterday\'s discussion, if I want to enable a solution, can I still use the metadata block at all?
2018-10-11T09:59:54 <the-t-in-rtf> or do I need to have a literal enabled setting for the solution?
2018-10-11T10:00:05 <the-t-in-rtf> like in the preferences block.
2018-10-11T10:00:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I see both used in the test data in universal, are the metadata ones are just cruft?
2018-10-11T10:01:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I ask so that I can clean it up while I\'m fixing the NVDA test file.
2018-10-11T10:06:24 <the-t-in-rtf> thinking it through, I will probably hold off on cleaning up and just add TODO notes for when we loop back around to addressing stuff like "I want a screen reader, and this one if it\'s available".
2018-10-11T10:07:56 <the-t-in-rtf> but I\'d still like to confirm that my understanding is correct, i.e. that the "metadata" block is not meaningfully used at the moment.

I\'ll need this PR to go in before any code that relies on newer versions of Infusion can be merged. For example the changes I have coming for the contrast themes.
2018-10-11T12:12:26 <Justin_o> and the word space preference
2018-10-11T12:24:55 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, thanks for the linting rules - it\'s working

2018-10-11T13:47:27 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Hey, Tony! I continued your investigation from yesterday about the hang in CI after the execution of PSP/QSS tests
2018-10-11T13:48:11 <georgitodorov> One of the QSS tests was altering the "Language" setting which at least on my virtual machine was restarting the "explorer" process
2018-10-11T13:49:14 <georgitodorov> And when I removed that test, everything was fine - there was no hang
2018-10-11T13:49:33 <georgitodorov> I kept the test but without propagating the setting changes to Core
2018-10-11T13:50:18 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-10-11T13:50:24 <georgitodorov> In order for us to test QSS functionalities it is not necessary for the settings to be actually applied. We need to simply check if the corresponding function which notifies the Core will be invoked
2018-10-11T13:50:59 <georgitodorov> I pushed some changed a few minutes ago and I am now awaiting the CI\'s verdict :)
2018-10-11T13:53:16 <georgitodorov> Bosmon or the-t-in-rtf: The build failed at the "VM creation" step. Can one of you trigger it again?
2018-10-11T13:53:32 <georgitodorov> Or jhernandez perhaps ^

2018-10-11T15:05:25 <alanharnum> off the top of your head, what makes the hackathon page different from the others? it uses a lot of images, do the others not use any images at all? or a smaller number?
2018-10-11T15:06:51 <simonjb> I believe that the Hackathon page has the most images. Other pages do have images, but not as many. Such as: https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/ideas/co-design-session-1-synthesis/
2018-10-11T15:08:11 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I believe the Ansible role will still need to be updated, I\'ll add looking at this to my to-do list
2018-10-11T15:08:24 <Bosmon> alanharnum - awesome, thanks so much!
2018-10-11T15:11:28 <Bosmon> jhernandez - how about https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/53 - can I kill it too?
2018-10-11T15:12:10 <simonjb> alanharnum: also, one of the images is quite a bit larger than others we\'ve used (I use Hugo\'s built in image processing to resize it) -- 12290x3820 8 MB jpeg
2018-10-11T15:12:38 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, that\'s already included in danail\'s branch

2018-10-11T15:13:05 <alanharnum> simonjb: that\'s good information to know, thanks
2018-10-11T15:14:44 <Bosmon> CUE PANORAMA MUSIC!
2018-10-11T15:15:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon: oh, looks like Astea didn\'t pull this particular change https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/53/commits/39dde7b1d75f0132e55ebe36612a545bba48ee78#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R44
2018-10-11T15:16:07 <stegru> I\'m proud to say my code has managed to crash the linter, https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/displaySettingsHandler/src/dpiWindows10.js#L290
2018-10-11T15:16:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: the BBC programme? Is it still going?
2018-10-11T15:16:50 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, it is :)
2018-10-11T15:16:51 <simonjb> lookin at wikipedia, looks like it is -- since 1953
2018-10-11T15:16:57 <simonjb> !!!

2018-10-11T15:23:25 <alanharnum> simonjb: I\'ve added the verbose flag to the hugo build container, this should tell us more when it actually builds the site
2018-10-11T15:27:59 <alanharnum> simonjb: OK, the verbose logging reveals: "WARN 2018/10/11 15:26:06 WARNING: Timed out creating content for page "ideas/hackathon/index.md" (.Content will be empty). This is most likely a circular shortcode content loop that should be fixed. If this is just a shortcode calling a slow remote service, try to set "timeout=20000" (or higher, value is in milliseconds) in config.toml."

2018-10-11T15:28:31 <alanharnum> I think in the limited-memory container space, processing a number of big images is exceeding the render timeout
2018-10-11T15:29:06 <alanharnum> simonjb: the page at https://cities.inclusivedesign.ca/ideas/co-design-session-2/ has the same problem and same error message
2018-10-11T15:29:44 <alanharnum> "Timeout for generating page contents, in milliseconds (defaults to 10 seconds). Note: this is used to bail out of recursive content generation, if your pages are slow to generate (e.g., because they require large image processing or depend on remote contents) you might need to raise this limit."
2018-10-11T15:30:24 <simonjb> excellent alanharnum
2018-10-11T15:30:49 <alanharnum> I think the best thing to do is bump the render timeout in config.toml
2018-10-11T15:31:07 <simonjb> I can do that now -- what do you suggest we change it to?
2018-10-11T15:31:19 <alanharnum> let\'s try 30000 to start
2018-10-11T15:31:20 <simonjb> and let\'s leave the verbose flag on
