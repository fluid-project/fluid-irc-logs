2018-05-19T16:50:44 <sgithens> Bosmon: For subcomponents, is there an analogous destroyOnEvent in addition to createOnEvent?
2018-05-19T16:55:09 <sgithens> ok
2018-05-19T16:56:04 <sgithens> actually, what I think I want is a model listener, that will watch for a boolean in hte model, and when it changes, either create/destroy one of the subcomponents based on the model value
2018-05-19T16:56:29 <sgithens> I'm wondering if there is enough ioc syntax to do that without writing an invoker function to handle it

2018-05-19T18:27:29 <sgithens> oh, actually I realize now that it probably needs to be a dynamic component... up till now all my dynamic components had been arrays of things that had to be created and not just single items

2018-05-19T20:15:05 <Bosmon> sgithens - actually this will be a natural feature of the NEW FRAMEWORK
2018-05-19T20:15:10 <Bosmon> But right now you will have to do it yourself
2018-05-19T20:16:15 <Bosmon> You can see what is currently done in the preferences framework here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L367
