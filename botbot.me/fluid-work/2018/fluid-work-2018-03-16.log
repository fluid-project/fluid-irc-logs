2018-03-16T11:09:49 <atisayajain_> the-t-in-rtf1 I wanted to get some doubts cleared regarding the Live Learning tutorial project for GSoC. I will submit a draft proposal soon.
2018-03-16T11:10:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> That\'s fine.  The best thing to do when you\'re ready is to share the draft via google docs, so that I can make comments in each part of the text.
2018-03-16T11:10:45 <the-t-in-rtf1> My email address is tony@raisingthefloor.org.

2018-03-16T11:12:58 <atisayajain_> Sure, thanks. First thing I want to ask is do I need to prepare exersises as part of the project or are they already there?
2018-03-16T11:16:14 <atisayajain_> And is the aim of the project to build something similar to freecodecamp.org?
2018-03-16T11:21:06 <the-t-in-rtf1> The aim is indeed to build something like freecodecamp, or codeschool, or any other live learning environment.
2018-03-16T11:21:29 <the-t-in-rtf1> We have existing static tutorials, one approach would be to convert one or more of those.
2018-03-16T11:21:37 <the-t-in-rtf1> You might also write a new exercise depending.
2018-03-16T11:31:01 <atisayajain_> Okay, understood. There\xe2\x80\x99s this line in the project description \xe2\x80\x9cReview prior art within and outside of the Fluid community\xe2\x80\x9d. Would you please explain the meaning of art here?

2018-03-16T13:37:18 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I\'m finding that the node based tests ending in "-testSpec.js", when run as part all-tests.js in GPII Universal, do not actually run. I\'ve filed a JIRA about this just now. https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2908 Would be great if someone could verify this.

2018-03-16T13:46:18 <Justin_o> stegru: are those only intended to run in certain conditions then?
2018-03-16T13:47:44 <stegru> Justin_o: I run them via ./tests/AcceptanceTests.js from the windows repository - and it only runs the windows related ones
2018-03-16T13:48:13 * jhung joined the channel
2018-03-16T13:49:19 <Justin_o> stegru: these ones are included in the all-tests.js for universal. I\'ve highlighted some of them https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/all-tests.js#L44-L55
2018-03-16T13:50:33 <stegru> ah, i see - but I wouldn\'t expect both linux and windows ones to be ran in the same test, since they are OS specific
2018-03-16T13:51:45 <stegru> Justin_o: also, in that file there#s just "required", the actual tests aren\'t being ran
2018-03-16T13:52:42 <stegru> i mean, the testSpec files just define test data, not actual testing code

2018-03-16T14:02:57 <Justin_o> I think the solutions registry ones, at least the uio plus ones are just testing the model transformations. So i\'d expect that they could run in any environment really. but perhaps that\'s not true in all cases. But then I guess i don\'t fully understand the use case of including things in the all-tests.js file that aren\'t expected to actually run.
2018-03-16T14:03:02 <Justin_o> stegru: ^
2018-03-16T14:03:54 <stegru> actually, those lines you highlighted are new, Justin_o
2018-03-16T14:04:30 <stegru> I\'ll refer you to the-t-in-rtf1, who put them in
2018-03-16T14:06:06 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, our coverage was incomplete as a result of not calling those, and Dr. Basman assured me they were actually safe to run cross-platform.
2018-03-16T14:06:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> Which matches what I saw.
2018-03-16T14:06:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> I would in fact hope for the opposite, i.e. everything in universal should be safe to test on any platform, so I\'m actually glad that\'s the case.
2018-03-16T14:08:32 <stegru> well, the js code in the testSpec files are cross platform, but the tests aren\'t
2018-03-16T14:09:10 * Sushant joined the channel
2018-03-16T14:09:41 <stegru> which is why the /tests/ aren\'t being ran, like Justin_o observed
2018-03-16T14:10:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> I\'m not sure about that, it uses the same gpii.test.bootstrap mechanism that the acceptance tests do.
2018-03-16T14:10:52 <the-t-in-rtf1> Just reading through that now trying to understand.

2018-03-16T14:11:26 <Sushant> alanharnum : can you please elaborate what is to be done in https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5223?filter=-3
2018-03-16T14:11:35 <stegru> ok - I don\'t know what actually happens, but I\'m confident the windows tests will not succeed on Linux
2018-03-16T14:12:03 <stegru> (linux has no registry, or SystemParametersInfo api call)
2018-03-16T14:13:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/36433633d01e59028ffefe0b4fcc59ef7d3886b2/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Testing.js#L464
2018-03-16T14:13:52 <Sushant> what is to be done in https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5223?filter=-3, anyone?
2018-03-16T14:13:58 <alanharnum> Sushant: I\'m not sure if the bug is even present any more (that bug was first filed almost five years ago), so a first step would be to try and replicate it.
2018-03-16T14:14:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> Seems like they are run some of the time.
2018-03-16T14:15:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> And the coverage definitely changed.
2018-03-16T14:15:18 <alanharnum> Sushant: a starting point for that would be having the Infusion repo (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion) built locally, at which point you\'d need to try to replicate the bug - but it\'s a somewhat complicated one in a reasonably complicated part of the framework
2018-03-16T14:16:17 <Sushant> Oh! The issue wasn\'t closed, and hence, i chose to solve it. But when i opened tested it there was nothing like that. Can you give me some frontend issue that i can solve in order to mention in my gsoc proposal.
2018-03-16T14:17:12 <alanharnum> Sushant: have you looked at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=42008647?
2018-03-16T14:17:17 <alanharnum> that\'s got a list of "good first bugs"
2018-03-16T14:18:04 <Sushant> alanharnum : says not found.
2018-03-16T14:18:58 <alanharnum> Sushant: the page URL? it works for me, or you can try the filter directly in our issue tracker: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6027?jql=labels%20%3D%20good_first_bug

2018-03-16T14:54:59 <Justin_o> Sushant: you are welcome to work on FLUID-6117. There is a page we\'d like to use linked in the comments of that issue. Note that you\'ll need to make sure to attribute the original page appropriately, and that the demo works properly with the preference adjuster, including all of it\'s adaptation. And of course works on mobile and small screens. It\'s likely not a trivial task though.. just warning you ahead of time.
2018-03-16T14:56:22 <Sushant> Thanks! I\'ll try not to make any mistakes.
2018-03-16T14:57:01 <Justin_o> Sushant: okay, good luck.. if there is another issue you\'d prefer to tackle, you are welcome to pick something else.

2018-03-16T15:37:22 <RishavShah> Is this the right place to discuss about google summer of code 2018?
2018-03-16T15:37:48 <michelled> RishavShah: yes, it is - unfortunately, I think both the mentors for the project you are interested are not available today
2018-03-16T15:38:13 <michelled> by \'workflow\' they are not referring to a programming language, but rather to a way of doing something

2018-03-16T16:34:04 <ussjoin_> RishavShah: I\'m confused why you DMed me. Did you just DM every person in the channel?
2018-03-16T16:37:26 <ussjoin_> fluid-all: It looks like RishavShah has simply been spamming a wide variety of people in this channel. I feel like that\'s relevant to your consideration.
