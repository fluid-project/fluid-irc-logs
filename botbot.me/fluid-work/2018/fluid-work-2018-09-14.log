b"2018-09-14T20:20:48 <alanharnum> michelled simonjb: I kicked the build job manually, since it timed out
2018-09-14T20:20:54 <alanharnum> am running some diagnostics now
2018-09-14T20:20:57 <michelled> thanks!
2018-09-14T20:21:24 <simonjb> thanks alanharnum
2018-09-14T20:21:53 <alanharnum> there's some fairly massive packet loss (83%) on the level3 hop immediately before GitHub
2018-09-14T20:22:11 <alanharnum> so this might be a problem upstream from us, though there's packet loss from cogent as well
2018-09-14T20:23:10 <simonjb> michelled: regarding https://github.com/inclusive-design/website-cities/pull/21 I'm happy to merge but I've no idea what it does :)
2018-09-14T20:23:28 <michelled> ha, that's how I felt about it too ;)
2018-09-14T20:23:36 <simonjb> other than alanharnum thinks it's a good idea (this is good enough for me)
2018-09-14T20:23:46 <michelled> for me too!
2018-09-14T20:24:12 <alanharnum> the cities website runs in a Docker container managed with docker-compose
2018-09-14T20:24:27 <alanharnum> this ensures it restarts if the server that its Docker instance is running on gets restarted :)
2018-09-14T20:24:30 <alanharnum> so yes it's a good thing
2018-09-14T20:24:58 <simonjb> it looks like the site updare went through successfully?
2018-09-14T20:25:01 <simonjb> update
2018-09-14T20:25:35 <michelled> excellent!!!!
2018-09-14T20:26:30 <simonjb> alanharnum: does it look to you like the cities site update succeeded? I see the expected new pages on the live site
2018-09-14T20:29:03 <alanharnum> simonjb: yeah, the job completed this time
2018-09-14T20:29:35 <simonjb> awesome thanks alanharnum -- and is it safe to merge https://github.com/inclusive-design/website-cities/pull/21 now?
2018-09-14T20:29:36 <alanharnum> there appears to be something significant going on at the level3 hop in Washington right before GitHub - it's got 85-90% packet loss right now
2018-09-14T20:29:45 <alanharnum> simonjb: should be fine
2018-09-14T20:30:06 <simonjb> done

2018-09-14T11:38:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have accumulated a stack of PRs that I\'m hoping you can look at. I know you\'re probably busy with lots of things, would it be better for me to re-assign any of them to other committers. Let me know if you\'d like a list of them.
2018-09-14T11:39:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - absolutely, I\'ve got some time today
2018-09-14T11:39:32 <Bosmon> Could you just assemble a short list somewhere?
2018-09-14T11:46:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, thanks.. i\'ll put that together
2018-09-14T12:25:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I just sent you an e-mail with a list of my open PRs needing review. I also updated the dependencies in some of the base PRs. So hopefully everything is up-to-date

2018-09-14T14:00:16 <simonjb> good morning sepidehshahi
2018-09-14T14:01:26 <sepidehshahi> hi simonjb
2018-09-14T14:01:46 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: are there things that I can help with today?
2018-09-14T14:02:58 <sepidehshahi> simonjb: we are preparing for the two co-design sessions that we have this weekend. We are also sending out Hackathon invitations. We need to add a description of the 10 ideas that will be built during the hackathon to the website, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an urgent thing
2018-09-14T14:03:18 <sepidehshahi> if you can help with adding those descriptions to the site would be be really great simonjb
2018-09-14T14:03:34 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: yes, I can definitely do that
2018-09-14T14:04:01 <sepidehshahi> awesome! can you have a quick call so we can decide how to add those descriptions?
2018-09-14T14:04:40 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: can we do 10:30?
2018-09-14T14:04:49 <sepidehshahi> sure simonjb
2018-09-14T14:05:11 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: great, chat to you then on vidyo
2018-09-14T14:05:20 <sepidehshahi> sure
2018-09-14T14:27:54 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: call me when it\'s good for you
2018-09-14T14:28:14 <sepidehshahi> you can connect to my room simonjb
2018-09-14T14:28:38 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I see it as locked
2018-09-14T14:28:52 <sepidehshahi> can you try again

2018-09-14T15:00:33 <jhernandez> no errors?
2018-09-14T15:00:58 <jhernandez> just, "unable to connect or the like?"
2018-09-14T15:06:03 <jhernandez> I guess that, after upgrading node, you re-npm installed and so on, isn\'t it?

2018-09-14T15:23:43 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: hey
2018-09-14T15:24:04 <jhernandez> I was doing some work on universal and I ran the linter
2018-09-14T15:24:17 <jhernandez> and got these warnings https://pastebin.com/GVgrFJGK
2018-09-14T15:24:33 <jhernandez> looks like it\'s the markdown linter
2018-09-14T15:25:24 <jhernandez> shall we consider either fixing the warnings or adjust our lint config for md files? (or both, I\'d say)
2018-09-14T15:25:29 <jhernandez> ?
2018-09-14T15:26:40 <jhernandez> the point is that the linting task stops after these warnings and you need to pass the --force to complete the rest of linting steps

2018-09-14T17:05:24 <simonjb> still to do: remaining project pages, intro on project description page and homepage
2018-09-14T17:08:11 <simonjb> michelled, sepidehshahi: I\'ve called the new page "Hackathon Project Descriptions" -- does that seem right?
2018-09-14T17:08:57 <sepidehshahi> sure simonjb, that\xe2\x80\x99s ok
2018-09-14T17:09:26 <simonjb> if you have other thoughts, let me know sepidehshahi
2018-09-14T17:09:39 <sepidehshahi> sure simonjb thanks
2018-09-14T17:09:57 <simonjb> if michelled is available, she can show you how it\'s looking sepidehshahi
2018-09-14T17:10:13 <simonjb> I will continue on the remaining project pages

2018-09-14T17:44:19 <Bosmon> alanharnum - it seems that botbot is going to be shut down permanently in about 2 months

2018-09-14T18:33:22 <simonjb> sepidehshahi, michelled: How\'s this for the front page "We\'ve gone through all of the great ideas from the co-design sessions and selected 8 of them to prototype at the September 21 Hackathon. For each one, we\'ve prepared a design challenge, which lists the required features and intended use cases for the project."
2018-09-14T18:34:03 <sepidehshahi> that sounds great simonjb
2018-09-14T18:34:22 <simonjb> thanks sepidehshahi, we\'re getting close
2018-09-14T18:34:31 <sepidehshahi> awesome :)

2018-09-14T18:48:01 <michelled> np - hope it\'s helpful!
2018-09-14T18:48:19 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: something I noticed is inconsistent bullet lists vs numbered lists
2018-09-14T18:48:34 <simonjb> some all bullets, some all numbered, some mix
2018-09-14T18:48:41 <simonjb> I left them as they were
2018-09-14T18:48:54 <simonjb> but wondering if we should make consistent
2018-09-14T18:49:07 <michelled> simonjb: sepidehshahi has gone to a meeting
2018-09-14T18:49:16 <michelled> I think it makes sense to make them consistent
2018-09-14T18:49:19 <simonjb> though I haven\'t read the text and don\'t know if the numbers are referred to
2018-09-14T18:49:25 <michelled> not sure if numbers or no numbers are better
2018-09-14T18:49:37 <michelled> I haven\'t seen the numbers be referred to
2018-09-14T18:49:55 <simonjb> ok, cool, so probably safe to make all bullets
2018-09-14T18:50:00 <michelled> yes
2018-09-14T18:57:21 <michelled> simonjb: sepidehshahi said she was fine with any wording changes we wanted to make
