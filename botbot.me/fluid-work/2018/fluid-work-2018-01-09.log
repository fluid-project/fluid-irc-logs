2018-01-09T22:54:49 <simonjb> colinclark: I found this article during the holidays that might lead to some interesting research on learning to code stuff https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/on-toys-that-teach-coding-5a6de92e6ad3
2018-01-09T22:59:08 <simonjb> I haven\'t followed up on all the references yet

2018-01-09T23:03:10 <gmoss> simonjb: my niece has a code-a-pillar, she loves it!
2018-01-09T23:03:34 <gmoss> she got it for her fourth birthday, i believe
2018-01-09T23:03:53 <gmoss> full disclosure: i haven\'t read that article yet
2018-01-09T23:04:31 <simonjb> gmoss: I hadn\'t seen the code-a-pillars before
2018-01-09T23:04:46 <simonjb> so many learning to code toys now
2018-01-09T23:05:04 <colinclark> baby mozart
2018-01-09T23:05:07 <colinclark> that\'s all i\'m saying
2018-01-09T23:05:11 <gmoss> I hadn\'t either, until I saw it in action, but recently i was at the local mega bookstore chain, and I saw it all over the shelves
2018-01-09T23:06:50 <simonjb> different topic, but wow, a computer that "fits in a USB port" https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/tomu
2018-01-09T23:09:35 <simonjb> looks like they reached the $2000 stretch goal to make plastic cases for them
2018-01-09T23:11:13 <simonjb> from xobs, who works with bunnie
2018-01-09T23:13:09 <simonjb> I really don\'t need one of these but I have a feeling that I will end up buying one
2018-01-09T23:14:04 <colinclark> simonjb: ha!
2018-01-09T23:14:46 <colinclark> I nearly felt that way also about the synthesizer-in-a-usb-port too
2018-01-09T23:16:47 <colinclark> simonjb: this article is REALLY interesting
2018-01-09T23:16:59 <simonjb> the Andy Ko one?
2018-01-09T23:18:40 <colinclark> yep
2018-01-09T23:19:12 <simonjb> yeah, and there are quite a few links outwards that I want to follow up on
2018-01-09T23:19:39 <colinclark> yes
2018-01-09T23:19:52 <colinclark> "youth are vastly more interested in creating art, visuals, animations, and manipulating physical objects, than they are in expressing formal procedures to computers. And that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising: it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of hard work to express a program, and the payoff isn\xe2\x80\x99t usually nearly as exciting to youth as the more visual and tactile things they can do"
2018-01-09T23:20:08 <simonjb> yes
2018-01-09T23:20:08 <colinclark> this is a profoundly strange argument to me
2018-01-09T23:20:33 <colinclark> i think it\'s very important
2018-01-09T23:21:59 <colinclark> gmoss: have you watched your niece play with the code a piller at all?
2018-01-09T23:22:03 <colinclark> or played with it with her?
2018-01-09T23:22:51 <colinclark> "All of these toys are a hollow attempt to extort cash from parents who fear their children will be automated out of a job."
2018-01-09T23:30:28 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-09T23:31:34 <gmoss> sorry colinclark, was pair coding :) I have seen her playing with it on her own, she was enjoying it quite a bit
2018-01-09T23:31:39 <colinclark> no problem!
2018-01-09T23:31:53 <colinclark> cool
2018-01-09T23:31:58 <colinclark> what kinds of things did she do with it?
2018-01-09T23:32:16 <gmoss> granted, she has a 1337-dev father to show her all the ins and outs :)
2018-01-09T23:32:48 <gmoss> well basically you arrange the segments of its body and each segment represents an action (go straight, turn left/right, play a tune, etc.), so she would just arrange it however and let it rip
2018-01-09T23:33:05 <gmoss> often playing the same sequence a number of times, but I think she understood that the order of the segments affected the order of actions
2018-01-09T23:33:19 <gmoss> it plays a song while it goes along
2018-01-09T23:36:26 <simonjb> gmoss: so it\'s programmed by what segments are added and it what order?
2018-01-09T23:37:20 <gmoss> simonjb: correct
2018-01-09T23:37:42 <gmoss> a very simple but tangible intro to programming
2018-01-09T23:42:04 <simonjb> gmoss: it\'s interesting that the programming and thing being controlled are a single unit

2018-01-09T10:26:40 <javjarfer[m]> good morning btw xD
2018-01-09T10:27:21 <stegru> hi
2018-01-09T10:27:37 <stegru> what pull?
2018-01-09T10:27:50 <stegru> oh the language one? no
2018-01-09T10:27:54 <javjarfer[m]> (you windows language pull)
2018-01-09T10:29:05 <javjarfer[m]> ok, then for me that pull looks nice, I was supposed to make the \'pre-review\' I don\'t know if you remember
2018-01-09T10:29:39 <stegru> good
2018-01-09T10:29:56 <stegru> put a comment in, so antranig or javi can see
2018-01-09T10:30:39 <javjarfer[m]> OK, doing
2018-01-09T10:31:46 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: I have just remembered something, I\'m going to comment it
2018-01-09T11:01:54 <javjarfer[m]> I just made a comment here https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/132/files#diff-f183c9185bcdd61677beebd16d9efba2R505

2018-01-09T11:13:45 <javjarfer[m]> What do you think about that stegru? Do you think we simply should avoid doing that in tests? In that case I wouldn\'t have found the inconsistencies with ClasssicShell restarting behavior
2018-01-09T11:17:41 <stegru> right, i didn\'t have trouble restarting it - i just didn\'t want to.
2018-01-09T11:18:59 <stegru> it\'s for a test.. so, what if it didn\'t work? you\'d be left with no explorer
2018-01-09T11:21:14 <javjarfer[m]> I understand, well, but in the other side, if you don\'t do it, then you are not \'testing it\'
2018-01-09T11:21:24 <stegru> yep
2018-01-09T11:21:37 <javjarfer[m]> Can\'t we develop a way or making sure to get explorer back for sure?
2018-01-09T11:22:10 <stegru> well, the apis are mocked.. so i do check they\'re called correctly. I can only assume the api functions work
2018-01-09T11:22:48 <stegru> yes, this is how we get explorer back for sure - but there\'s a chance it might not work, otherwise why test it?
2018-01-09T11:24:48 <javjarfer[m]> okay, mm well, in your case is different true
2018-01-09T11:25:17 <javjarfer[m]> I\'m testing a third party reliability, in your case we can test just proper API use as you says
2018-01-09T11:25:53 <javjarfer[m]> because it\'s simply that the API isn\'t working, well, then let\'s shutdown this things
2018-01-09T11:27:05 <javjarfer[m]> I agree all looks fine, again for me everything ok, I\'m going to write the message

2018-01-09T11:37:47 <yuriy__> hi kasparnet_ : we have started addressing the latest comments on the first PSP PR, but after our status call yesterday we identified that any remaining survey popup work should have the highest priority. And since the two PRs should be pretty independent, we were hoping you could take a look at the survey popup PR as well.
