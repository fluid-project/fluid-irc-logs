2018-01-18T21:31:55 <cindyli> smart, simonjb
2018-01-18T21:32:01 <simonjb> It checks for the text "289016"
2018-01-18T21:32:23 <simonjb> We way want to check with other text also, in case that doesn\'t appear on them all
2018-01-18T21:33:58 <cindyli> "other text" means all other source files?
2018-01-18T21:35:09 <simonjb> sorry, I meant in the git query something else in addition to "289016" like "European Union"

b'2018-01-18T15:20:37 <javjarfer[m]> A minimal script with UIA does the job, the problem is that even if you trigger the thing in the settings panel, the icon doesn\'t shows up
2018-01-18T15:20:43 <javjarfer[m]> just happens with GPII
2018-01-18T15:20:51 <stegru> ahh yes, i remember now
2018-01-18T15:21:07 <javjarfer[m]> > no, it has nothing to do with electron
2018-01-18T15:21:07 <javjarfer[m]> okay, then no clue where the error comes from
2018-01-18T15:21:09 * avtar joined the channel
2018-01-18T15:21:34 <stegru> ok, well, i don\'t know why it\'s not in the list - and i haven\'t seen that myself
2018-01-18T15:22:20 <javjarfer[m]> which list?
2018-01-18T15:22:34 <javjarfer[m]> the comments section on the jira issue?
2018-01-18T15:22:39 <stegru> the list in the settings panel
2018-01-18T15:23:01 <javjarfer[m]> mm that is interesting
2018-01-18T15:23:04 <javjarfer[m]> let me check
2018-01-18T15:23:15 <stegru> wait, i\'m only saying what I thought you\'re saying
2018-01-18T15:23:48 <stegru> ok.. it\'s in the list.. but the icon doesn\'t show when you make it show?
2018-01-18T15:24:26 <stegru> could you add a good comment on the jira, and maybe a screenshot?
2018-01-18T15:24:33 <javjarfer[m]> yes
2018-01-18T15:24:34 <javjarfer[m]> that is
2018-01-18T15:24:52 <stegru> also, have you tried to drag the icon from the pop-up into the tray?
2018-01-18T15:25:27 <javjarfer[m]> so, it looks like there is an issue in the way we \'register\' that icon
2018-01-18T15:25:56 <javjarfer[m]> > also, have you tried to drag the icon from the pop-up into the tray?
2018-01-18T15:25:57 <javjarfer[m]> I have assumed that was cheating
2018-01-18T15:26:23 <stegru> well, i was wondering if that worked
2018-01-18T15:26:31 <stegru> let me try to reproduce it
2018-01-18T15:27:01 <javjarfer[m]> okay
2018-01-18T15:30:41 <stegru> no, javjarfer[m] - just installed it, went to "Select which icons appear on the taskbar", turned GPII-App to "on" and the icon showed
2018-01-18T15:31:17 <stegru> are you telling lies? ;)
2018-01-18T15:31:39 * danayo joined the channel
2018-01-18T15:32:07 <javjarfer[m]> omagad, I should be lying
2018-01-18T15:32:22 <stegru> i\'m using a fresh install of windows, and not our vagrant vm
2018-01-18T15:32:38 <javjarfer[m]> I wish I\'m lying
2018-01-18T15:33:27 <javjarfer[m]> okay, I will destroy everything and try it again
2018-01-18T15:33:31 <javjarfer[m]> which version of GPII-App are you using?
2018-01-18T15:33:52 <javjarfer[m]> have you build the installer yourself or it\'s the last one for testing?
2018-01-18T15:34:12 <stegru> i don\'t know, a random one
2018-01-18T15:34:14 <stegru> heh
2018-01-18T15:35:46 <javjarfer[m]> haha, I will try the same with the last version for the demos
2018-01-18T15:35:54 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-01-18T15:35:57 <javjarfer[m]> I will create a installer and see what happens
2018-01-18T15:36:17 <javjarfer[m]> hope it works
2018-01-18T15:36:49 * kavya has quit
2018-01-18T15:36:53 <javjarfer[m]> and then I just need to integrate the little solution with your work in there and we are ready to go
2018-01-18T15:37:06 <stegru> ok
2018-01-18T15:41:40 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, GPII source code files have this 2007-2013 EU funding notice: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/src/AuthServer.js#L7-L8, do you think it\'s ok to remove them or they should continue to be kept?
2018-01-18T15:44:00 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: just tried the build I gave to kavya the other day - I works
2018-01-18T15:46:51 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s an issue for colinclark
2018-01-18T15:47:09 <Bosmon> I presume the notice has to be kept since we did indeed receive the funding ...
2018-01-18T15:47:18 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason to remove them, no
2018-01-18T15:47:19 <Bosmon> But perhaps it can just be put in a central licence file
2018-01-18T15:47:39 <colinclark> I can\'t remember the precise requirements, but I believe they needed to be in each file, oddly enough
2018-01-18T15:47:47 <colinclark> I think in a few years it will be appropriate to consolidate them
2018-01-18T15:47:54 <colinclark> and to be clear, any new files do not need them
2018-01-18T15:48:15 <cindyli> ok, placing them back in my pull request. thanks
2018-01-18T15:48:17 <colinclark> or files that you, cindyli working on exclusively (or simonjb)
2018-01-18T15:48:28 <colinclark> but you two are a bit of an exception in that regard
2018-01-18T15:48:39 <cindyli> ah, good to know ;)
2018-01-18T15:49:03 <colinclark> this reminds me, i still need to test Bosmon\'s Infusion PR
2018-01-18T15:49:06 <colinclark> sorry for the delay
2018-01-18T15:49:14 <colinclark> what a week it\'s been
2018-01-18T15:50:07 <javjarfer[m]> > javjarfer[m]: just tried the build I gave to kavya the other day - I works
2018-01-18T15:50:08 <javjarfer[m]> great
2018-01-18T15:50:15 <javjarfer[m]> you, have been faster stegru
2018-01-18T15:50:15 <simonjb> thanks cindyli and colinclark
2018-01-18T15:50:50 <javjarfer[m]> well, then I guess the only thing it\'s left is making a PR against your pull
2018-01-18T15:51:17 <stegru> what pull?
2018-01-18T15:51:42 <javjarfer[m]> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/35
2018-01-18T15:51:50 <stegru> ah yes
2018-01-18T15:52:14 <javjarfer[m]> maybe here would be a good place

2018-01-18T16:05:40 <javjarfer[m]> They really want to centralize the entire settings into one point
2018-01-18T16:05:51 <javjarfer[m]> how have you discovered that they make such checks?

2018-01-18T16:07:27 <stegru> i just looked at it :)
2018-01-18T16:08:08 <stegru> that check is new, an older version of windows 10 doesn\'t have it in
2018-01-18T16:09:05 <javjarfer[m]> ahh okay, disassembly then
2018-01-18T16:09:11 <javjarfer[m]> which one do you use?
2018-01-18T16:09:23 <javjarfer[m]> the one made by the jetbrains people is good
2018-01-18T16:09:57 <stegru> IDA
2018-01-18T16:10:13 <stegru> yeh, but that\'s for .net
2018-01-18T16:11:23 <javjarfer[m]> > yeh, but that\'s for .net
2018-01-18T16:11:27 <javjarfer[m]> yes, and it works really well
2018-01-18T16:11:36 <javjarfer[m]> okay, so IDA, I have never tried it

2018-01-18T16:19:01 <javjarfer[m]> well, maybe it has something to be with list getting bigger

2018-01-18T16:26:22 <stegru> oh that reminds me, javjarfer[m] - the icon positions are stored in the registry
2018-01-18T16:27:11 <javjarfer[m]> that is also interesting, do we want to have a specific position?

2018-01-18T16:35:29 <stegru> yes: put it on the tray
2018-01-18T16:36:15 <stegru> the settings are stored in IconStreams, which is a binary blob

2018-01-18T13:11:13 <jhernandez_> stegru: hey!
2018-01-18T13:11:22 <stegru> hello! jhernandez_
2018-01-18T13:11:43 <jhernandez_> I\'m continuing the work that gloob started to create the installer for the pilots and I\'m getting into a weird problem
2018-01-18T13:11:50 <jhernandez_> TypeError: gpii.windows.advapi32.OpenSCManagerW is not a function
2018-01-18T13:11:52 <stegru> ok
2018-01-18T13:12:29 <jhernandez_> I checked that we\'re pulling the right windows and universal modules
2018-01-18T13:12:32 <stegru> what branch?
2018-01-18T13:13:11 <jhernandez_> Ale created a new branch and I\'ve merged a couple of things that were missing
2018-01-18T13:13:23 <jhernandez_> so right now it\'s a local branch
2018-01-18T13:13:50 <jhernandez_> but I can share it with you, hold a sec
2018-01-18T13:14:03 * jhung joined the channel
2018-01-18T13:14:24 <stegru> here\'s the function defined: https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/15afe4d88fe87e2093b6e2890c5bcdc1ed21e795/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js#L206
2018-01-18T13:15:24 <jhernandez_> yup, I found it and it\'s there
2018-01-18T13:15:35 <jhernandez_> here\'s the branch btw https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/tree/base-PSP-Listeners%2BPCP-client
2018-01-18T13:16:03 <jhernandez_> as you can see, it\'s a WIP branch, i.e.: I\'m not taking into account installer related stuff yet
2018-01-18T13:16:50 <jhernandez_> but I\'m experiencing the same by using Ale\'s branch of gpii-windows
2018-01-18T13:17:01 <jhernandez_> let me share it with you
2018-01-18T13:17:50 <jhernandez_> https://github.com/gloob/windows/tree/base-PSP-Listeners
2018-01-18T13:18:41 <jhernandez_> not sure if it\'s better to start from the beginning, since I see that your pull requests are passing CI
2018-01-18T13:19:18 <jhernandez_> stegru: could it be an ffi-related thing?
2018-01-18T13:19:39 <stegru> it could be, i\'ve look at the code and it looks right
2018-01-18T13:20:47 <jhernandez_> yeah, me too - it "looks" right
2018-01-18T13:31:37 <stegru> oh jhernandez_ ...
2018-01-18T13:31:52 <stegru> https://github.com/gloob/windows/blob/base-PSP-Listeners/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js#L223
2018-01-18T13:32:12 <stegru> advapi is defined twice
2018-01-18T13:32:36 <stegru> lines 221-224 need to be removed
2018-01-18T13:32:51 <jhernandez_> mm
2018-01-18T13:33:17 <stegru> looks like a bad merge
2018-01-18T13:34:34 <jhernandez_> yes
2018-01-18T13:35:13 <jhernandez_> that\'s why I was thinking on start merging from scratch
2018-01-18T13:36:12 <jhernandez_> stegru: thanks for the finding!

2018-01-18T14:23:48 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru ! Are you there?
2018-01-18T14:24:40 <stegru> yes javjarfer[m]
2018-01-18T14:24:51 <stegru> (just making a coffee)
2018-01-18T14:25:46 * clown joined the channel
2018-01-18T14:28:27 <stegru> what is it?
2018-01-18T14:29:07 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: nice, what do you think about changing this: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/152/files/b064ee128fb723e06b42b233497b3cdf285ae734#diff-5c0cfc75f00324faa9894f6b3dd2489cR703 into something like
2018-01-18T14:30:02 <javjarfer[m]> closeProcessAfterCommand with arguments being "command", "processToClose", and options
2018-01-18T14:30:13 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-01-18T14:30:21 <stegru> do what ever tickles your fancy
2018-01-18T14:30:49 <stegru> but, it\'s also starting a process
2018-01-18T14:31:00 <stegru> ah
2018-01-18T14:31:01 <javjarfer[m]> and in options having: "processToWaitAfterCommand", and "processToWaitState".
2018-01-18T14:31:43 <stegru> hmm.. self-documenting names
2018-01-18T14:31:59 <javjarfer[m]> being processToWaitState: "Running", "Closed", "Open"
2018-01-18T14:32:03 <stegru> do whatever you think is best, I don\'t have a strong opinion
2018-01-18T14:32:13 <stegru> ok
2018-01-18T14:32:23 <javjarfer[m]> yes... you know, too much info, but, we only have one entry point...
2018-01-18T14:32:28 <stegru> i know
2018-01-18T14:32:36 <javjarfer[m]> I\'m open to suggestions, I don\'t like then very much xD
2018-01-18T14:32:53 <stegru> i\'m not keen on any :)
2018-01-18T14:33:47 <stegru> but i do know that if you\'re struggling to name it, in under 10 words, then it\'s probably a bad function ;)
2018-01-18T14:33:53 <javjarfer[m]> okay then, I will reformat into that last one, at at least\x0f you have got at first what was trying to mean
2018-01-18T14:35:24 <javjarfer[m]> hahaha yes, you are right, composition is the key there
2018-01-18T14:35:43 <javjarfer[m]> that give me a though, what about execWaitClose?
2018-01-18T14:35:44 <stegru> closeProcessAfterCommand seems ok
2018-01-18T14:35:53 <stegru> hmm
2018-01-18T14:35:58 <javjarfer[m]> exec -> command, wait -> process, close -> process
2018-01-18T14:36:37 <javjarfer[m]> or maybe, better, execCheckClose
2018-01-18T14:36:45 <stegru> yes
2018-01-18T14:37:42 <javjarfer[m]> execCheckClose(command, processToClose, { processToCheck: process, processToCheckState: {running, closing, opened}, etc...}
2018-01-18T14:38:13 <javjarfer[m]> that sounds far better no?
2018-01-18T14:38:15 <stegru> or just enableClassicShell(true/false) ;)
2018-01-18T14:39:50 <javjarfer[m]> It sounded in my ears like a joke for a second, but it\'s really the way to go
2018-01-18T14:40:12 <stegru> yeh, it\'s too specialised
2018-01-18T14:41:32 <stegru> runSomethingWaitForAnotherThingToDieThenCloseSomethingElse()
2018-01-18T14:43:05 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-01-18T14:44:05 <stegru> what about passing a function as a parameter, in the "start" block.. then you can have something like:
2018-01-18T14:44:37 <javjarfer[m]> At the end we need to call it from the SR, maybe we should talk about that with more people of the team, if something requires so much specific \'behavior\' we can simply create an appropriate entry name for the start-stop blocks in the SR
2018-01-18T14:44:47 <stegru> startProcess(command, (){stopProcess()} )
2018-01-18T14:45:31 <javjarfer[m]> with the new kasparnet rewrite from GPII-1230, they will pass to be settings handlers
2018-01-18T14:46:29 <stegru> well, let\'s keep it like it is for now, and by the time I\'ve done the processReporter refactoring we\'ll see what we can do then
2018-01-18T14:46:38 <javjarfer[m]> so we could start some-kind of convention for application with special necessities with own settings hanlders
2018-01-18T14:46:47 <javjarfer[m]> oh, okay
2018-01-18T14:47:02 <javjarfer[m]> then I will keep it like that with the \'last-name\'?
2018-01-18T14:47:10 <javjarfer[m]> or which one does look better for you?
2018-01-18T14:47:17 <stegru> any
2018-01-18T14:47:28 <javjarfer[m]> hahahaha
2018-01-18T14:47:32 <javjarfer[m]> okay
2018-01-18T14:47:59 <javjarfer[m]> execCheckAndClose then
2018-01-18T14:48:41 <stegru> wait, instead of check?
2018-01-18T14:49:48 <javjarfer[m]> Cool, yes, maybe it\'s better
2018-01-18T14:49:55 <javjarfer[m]> until we have specific things for specific solutions will be like that
2018-01-18T14:50:06 <stegru> ok

2018-01-18T15:16:27 <stegru> that\'s ok
2018-01-18T15:16:49 <javjarfer[m]> xD roger that
2018-01-18T15:17:14 <javjarfer[m]> wanted to ask you if you knew something more about GPII-2554
2018-01-18T15:17:44 * jhung joined the channel
2018-01-18T15:18:10 <stegru> no, I haven\'t looked into it further
2018-01-18T15:18:26 <javjarfer[m]> When we looked at it, it looked like we could be seen a bug in electron, and that was the reason we couldn\'t  trigger the thing
2018-01-18T15:18:55 <javjarfer[m]> > no, I haven\'t looked into it further
2018-01-18T15:18:56 <javjarfer[m]> It looks like it will be a priority because it will be needed for the pilots
2018-01-18T15:19:19 <stegru> yeh, I thought you where looking into it with mimic?
2018-01-18T15:20:01 <javjarfer[m]> so, I will try to take a look at it and see if there is any kind of electron bug opened or something like that
2018-01-18T15:20:15 <stegru> no, it has nothing to do with electron
2018-01-18T15:20:36 <javjarfer[m]> > yeh, I thought you where looking into it with mimic?
