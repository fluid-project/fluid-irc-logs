2018-05-17T14:54:41 <stegru> hi cindyli, I\'ve updated master and it\'s saying: Error when retrieving preferences: GPII key \\"vicky\\" does not exist while executing HTTP GET on url http://localhost/preferences/%gpiiKey?merge=%merge"
2018-05-17T14:55:00 <stegru> do you know what could cause this? I\'m assuming it\'s something to do with your recent merge
2018-05-17T14:55:20 <stegru> and it occurs with every user
2018-05-17T14:55:59 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-05-17T14:59:14 * yuriy has quit
2018-05-17T14:59:24 <cindyli> stegru: is the error from running tests?
2018-05-17T14:59:38 <cindyli> did you run "npm install" after pulling the master
2018-05-17T14:59:40 <stegru> no, cindyli, just running
2018-05-17T14:59:42 <stegru> oh!
2018-05-17T15:02:41 <stegru> npm install didn\'t solve it.. all I\'m doing is keying in - what area should I look at?
2018-05-17T15:02:50 <cindyli> "npm install" runs a postinstall step which converts preferences files to new data formats
2018-05-17T15:02:56 <stegru> hmm ok
2018-05-17T15:03:06 <cindyli> is "vicky" a new key?
2018-05-17T15:03:10 <cindyli> checking..
2018-05-17T15:03:21 <stegru> no, and it happens for others, like elod
2018-05-17T15:03:55 <cindyli> i found those 2 preferences files are in testData/preferences folder
2018-05-17T15:04:09 <cindyli> you need to copy them to tests/data/preferences
2018-05-17T15:04:14 <cindyli> then run "npm run postinall"
2018-05-17T15:04:45 <cindyli> we now separate the preferences data from running tests and starting GPII
2018-05-17T15:04:52 <stegru> ah ok
2018-05-17T15:09:20 <stegru> that still doesn\'t work, cindyli... but it\'s ok i might now have enough information to figure it out
2018-05-17T15:10:12 <cindyli> ok. if you need help, you can push up your branch and I can try it at my end, stegru
2018-05-17T15:10:41 <stegru> it\'s master
2018-05-17T15:12:13 <cindyli> well, clown just tried the master and keyins passed
2018-05-17T15:13:53 <stegru> ok there must be something wrong with my source directory (or clown is cheating somehow)
2018-05-17T15:14:12 <cindyli> all node and browser tests passed, right, clown?
2018-05-17T15:14:54 <clown> cindyli, stegru, to be precise:  I merged the lastest universal master into one of my PRs, and ran the tests.
2018-05-17T15:15:10 <clown> Looks like all is good \xe2\x80\x94 I see failures, but I believe they are expected failures.
2018-05-17T15:15:53 <clown> for example:  "CloudBased flowManager: GET request at /untrusted-settings for the GPII key (os_gnome) failed with error: { \xe2\x80\xa6"
2018-05-17T15:18:58 * danayo joined the channel
2018-05-17T15:19:00 <cindyli> that failure is expected. it\'s testing a request to be rejected by having the request provide a wrong access token

2018-05-17T15:19:42 <clown> cindyli, stegru: I\'m not seeing the "vicky" error that you see in my test log
2018-05-17T15:20:19 <stegru> i\'m not testing, clown.. just trying to key-in
2018-05-17T15:20:26 <stegru> haven\'t ran the tests
2018-05-17T15:20:35 <clown> ah, okay
2018-05-17T15:20:40 <cindyli> stegru: ah, you are not running tests
2018-05-17T15:20:43 <stegru> i\'m just rebuilding everything now from scratch
2018-05-17T15:20:55 <stegru> oh, the tests produce something?
2018-05-17T15:21:00 <cindyli> stegru: no
2018-05-17T15:21:10 <cindyli> stegru: do you use the default config?
2018-05-17T15:21:26 <cindyli> by running "node gpii.js"?
2018-05-17T15:21:30 <stegru> I don\'t use any config - so yes, the default
2018-05-17T15:21:38 <cindyli> ok, i can try it here
2018-05-17T15:22:35 * yuriy__ has quit
2018-05-17T15:27:17 <cindyli> provisioning the windows vm, which will take some time. I did test earlier this week with the windows vm by keying in/out with carla and vladimir, had no problem
2018-05-17T15:29:42 <clown> cindyli:   looking good so far:  https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-tests/855/
2018-05-17T15:31:23 <mrtyler> cindyli: can you make sure you are getting notifications from slack? i pinged you a little while ago. thx
2018-05-17T15:31:53 <stegru> cindyli, clown: it works on a fresh build

2018-05-17T15:34:27 <cindyli> yay! thanks, stegru
