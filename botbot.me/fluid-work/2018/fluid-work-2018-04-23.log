2018-04-23T11:42:50 <Bosmon> Hey there georgitodorov, dandimitrov_ - thanks for your updates to the I18N work for the app, merged now!
2018-04-23T11:43:09 <Bosmon> I\'ve added some comments to the "Onboarding the PSP" JIRA at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2653 with a small pull to the core
2018-04-23T11:43:29 <Bosmon> And also a pointer to existing onboarded code in Justin_o\'s chrome extension that shows how this client API works
2018-04-23T11:44:04 <Bosmon> I\'ve suggested that we adopt the code in the chrome extensions\'s "gpii.wsConnector" and get this ready to put in its own package as a demonstration client of the "Generic API for AT"

2018-04-23T16:46:44 <sgithens> cindyli: Could you ping me whenever you get a change to revert the old prefs server back in to 2630?

2018-04-23T16:53:06 <cindyli> sgithens: it will return just safe.preferences value, as what\'s returned by the preferences server in the master
2018-04-23T16:53:58 <sgithens> cindyli: ok, thx!
2018-04-23T16:54:07 <sgithens> I\'ll maybe add that to the new ticket then
2018-04-23T16:54:24 <cindyli> yes, please
2018-04-23T16:54:31 <sgithens> to get entire safes and their keysets

2018-04-23T17:21:58 <sgithens> cindyli: Do you ever use your universal branch with a locally installed couchdb, or do you usually always test/development with a docker image running couch?
2018-04-23T17:22:30 <cindyli> sgithens: the latter
2018-04-23T17:23:03 <cindyli> see https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/package.json#L78
2018-04-23T17:24:10 <cindyli> it spins up the VM in the universal root directory and scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh pulls docker images that has couchdb
2018-04-23T17:24:41 <sgithens> cool, and then it\'s still running? Can you use the futon interface to inspect data from there?
2018-04-23T17:24:47 <sgithens> that\'s in the couch image?
2018-04-23T17:24:58 <cindyli> yes, you can
2018-04-23T17:26:12 <sgithens> so just `npm test:vagrantProduction` and when it\'s done the Virtual Box will be up there an running in the background (no UI or desktop) and then it\'s exposed as a couple ports to your host machine?
2018-04-23T17:26:46 <sgithens> A couple ports for the GPII and then a port for the CouchDB futon
2018-04-23T17:28:59 <cindyli> sgithens: yes, running this command will give a running cloud based flow manager, but i don\'t think ports are exposed to the host machine. the ports are mapped from docker containers to VM
2018-04-23T17:29:33 <cindyli> inside the VM, use localhost:9081 to access the cloud based flow manager
2018-04-23T17:29:50 <sgithens> cindyli: Oh, does it actually start up a VM with a linux desktop?
2018-04-23T17:29:57 <cindyli> couchdb futon should be localhost:5984/_utils
2018-04-23T17:30:28 <cindyli> you mean with a linux host machine? I think so
2018-04-23T17:30:47 <sgithens> like when you\'re done running it all, a Gnome3 window pops up
2018-04-23T17:31:21 <sgithens> Like when you\'re done runnng vagrant from the windows repo a Windows10 Desktop popped up
2018-04-23T17:31:43 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-04-23T17:31:48 <sgithens> It\'s been a while since I ran it from universal, so I didn\'t know if it would pop up a full desktop environment, or just run a headless VM in the background
2018-04-23T17:32:08 <cindyli> ok, i see, it\'s a full desktop environment
2018-04-23T17:32:23 <sgithens> cindyli: Awesome thanks!
