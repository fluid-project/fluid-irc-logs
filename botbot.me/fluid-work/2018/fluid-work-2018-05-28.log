2018-05-28T07:27:25 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! As you now, we are in the process of developing the QSS functionalities. The purpose of the QSS is to enable the user to change the settings on the computer even if the user is not keyed in. I tried updating the DPI setting without a keyed in user by sending the usual message to the Core via the websocket.
2018-05-28T07:27:50 <georgitodorov> Unfortunately, it won\'t work that way. I suppose this method works only if there is a keyed in user.
2018-05-28T07:28:37 <georgitodorov> Can you advise us how to proceed with this? Will any changes need to be made to the Core to support this behavior?

2018-05-28T09:33:07 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, we will need to make changes to core
2018-05-28T09:33:25 <Bosmon> I will make up a JIRA and work package, since there some other changes that we should make at the same time
2018-05-28T09:33:37 <Bosmon> For example support for the so-called "one way keys"
2018-05-28T09:33:56 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Great, thank you!
2018-05-28T09:34:06 <Bosmon> We\'ll allocate a session at our Toronto face to face to talk over this amongst the core team
