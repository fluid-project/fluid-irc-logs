b'2018-03-29T15:01:39 <dandimitrov> Like a charm ;)
2018-03-29T15:02:58 <Bosmon> Very good
2018-03-29T15:03:02 <dandimitrov> I\'m writing down all decisions we made for the current implementation just to have them all in a single place
2018-03-29T15:03:46 <dandimitrov> And to discuss them with the others, but unfortunately I won\'t be able to finish them for today :(
2018-03-29T15:04:36 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - that\'s ok, these discussions will continue for a while
2018-03-29T15:04:46 <Bosmon> Actually I think today\'s discussion will focus more on JSON schema support
2018-03-29T15:05:08 <dandimitrov> We\'ll could add these decisions to a WIP PR
2018-03-29T15:12:13 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, ok, thanks

2018-03-29T18:00:25 <cindyli> where is it, Bosmon? room 3?
2018-03-29T18:00:33 <cindyli> or skype?
2018-03-29T18:00:37 <Bosmon> I guess I was thinking of Skype
2018-03-29T18:00:45 <Bosmon> I never grasp how to start gotomeetings
2018-03-29T18:00:50 <Bosmon> And I hear that we will be axing it anyway
2018-03-29T18:01:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: really.. what will it be replaced with?
2018-03-29T18:01:09 <cindyli> ok, can you pull me into the call when it starts, Bosmon?
2018-03-29T18:01:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, i\'m available to join the i18n meeting too
2018-03-29T18:01:13 <Bosmon> I don\'t kow
2018-03-29T18:01:25 <Bosmon> That is, I don\'t know what it will be replaced with
2018-03-29T18:01:32 <sgithens> Adobe Connect
2018-03-29T18:01:32 <Bosmon> Sure, I will pull you in

2018-03-29T18:02:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.
2018-03-29T18:02:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I am here.
2018-03-29T18:02:40 <sgithens> Amazing, our power has actually gone out about 20 minutes ago.  Though I should have enough juice to make it through this meeting
2018-03-29T18:02:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, can you pull me in?
2018-03-29T18:03:53 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, is your network on a UPS?
2018-03-29T18:04:06 <sgithens> No, I\'m just using my phone
2018-03-29T18:04:09 <the-t-in-rtf> ah.
2018-03-29T18:04:19 <sgithens> honestly, is pretty fast
2018-03-29T18:04:32 <sgithens> I don\'t know really notice until I try to do a npm install from scratch

2018-03-29T13:57:58 <gtirloni> it seems like a red herring but I\'m not sure. It actually started failing I changed something completely unrelated (added a timeout to eslint).

2018-03-29T14:05:03 <Bosmon> I\'ve never seen a failure as terrible as that reported by gtirloni but it looks like a node.js bug to me

2018-03-29T14:08:17 <jhernandez> btw, I just wanted to bring your attention to https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2911
2018-03-29T14:08:48 * grrrero joined the channel
2018-03-29T14:09:43 <gtirloni> Bosmon: thanks, I\'ll keeping. Perhaps this is the VM environment making node reach some corner case. I\'ll have more time to debug in a few hours
2018-03-29T14:10:11 <jhernandez> looks like our attempts to avoid the network problem in the past are not "rock solid" enough :/
2018-03-29T14:10:16 <Bosmon> But yes, my guess is memory exhaustion
2018-03-29T14:10:26 <Bosmon> But node should report that rather more clearly
2018-03-29T14:10:28 <gtirloni> ok
2018-03-29T14:11:04 <jhernandez> gtirloni: again, I keep gettting a "page not found" when trying to see those logs in buildkite

2018-03-29T14:12:37 <jhernandez> I\'m using my RtF email
2018-03-29T14:13:46 <gtirloni> let me see. Avtar was working more closely with it
2018-03-29T14:15:48 <gtirloni> ok, invite sent
2018-03-29T14:18:36 * yuriy joined the channel
2018-03-29T14:21:27 <gtirloni> the logs should be public though.. interesting. Right now i have 5 guys poking holes on my house and saying things like "shit" and sometimes  "oh! Hmm" . once they\'re gone I can troubleshoot this better

2018-03-29T14:27:17 <jhernandez> gtirloni: thanks
2018-03-29T14:29:11 <jhernandez> and yes guys, I\'m also renovating the house and sometimes I say "mierda" and scream each time a new problem pops up
2018-03-29T14:29:24 <jhernandez> :)
2018-03-29T14:29:51 * ShadX__ has quit

2018-03-29T14:55:09 <Bosmon> Uncannily similar to the late great MACKSWELL

2018-03-29T14:55:31 <alanharnum> that\'s a bit uncanny
2018-03-29T14:55:49 <alanharnum> i see he too suffered from what is referred to as "forkbeard syndrome"
2018-03-29T14:55:55 <Bosmon> :) :)
2018-03-29T14:56:03 <Bosmon> It is, isn\'t it
2018-03-29T14:56:15 <alanharnum> and i hate sounding like such a technofetishist but holy cow have smartphone cameras gotten better in the last four years
2018-03-29T14:56:24 <Bosmon> Yes they really have
2018-03-29T14:56:32 <alanharnum> i went from a Galaxy S5 to a Pixel 2 XL and it\'s honestly a bit gobsmacking
2018-03-29T14:57:09 <yuriy> Bosmon: unfortunately, none of us will be able to attend today\'s call. You have been discussing the current approach with the team at length last week, but would it be helpful for us to provide some additional details?
2018-03-29T14:57:27 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame that we hadn\'t upgraded our phones in time for the birth of our son
2018-03-29T14:57:46 <Bosmon> I was just looking through the albums and found that the first 40 minutes of his life was documented on a Samsung J3
2018-03-29T14:58:03 <Bosmon> Which would make even your S5 look a bit magnificent
2018-03-29T14:58:31 <Bosmon> yuriy - I think we probably know enough - is the most recent version of your "dynamic distributions" approach checked in?

2018-03-29T15:00:28 <dandimitrov> Hi, Bosmon, yep. They can be found here -> https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2894/src/common/messageBundles.js
2018-03-29T15:01:22 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - that\'s great, thanks
2018-03-29T15:01:24 <Bosmon> Does it work? : P
