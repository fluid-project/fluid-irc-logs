2018-11-05T09:29:41 <dandimitrov> Hey, the-t-in-rtf, I was thinking of merging https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/51 in case you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional comments :?
2018-11-05T09:30:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m fine with merging it.
2018-11-05T09:36:21 <dandimitrov> Great, thanks
2018-11-05T11:44:42 <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf: Do you know whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to see Jenkin\xe2\x80\x99s coverage report details (I\xe2\x80\x99m able to see only the console output)?

2018-11-05T12:19:39 <the-t-in-rtf> depends on the build, I think the reports dir is saved as an artifact in some of them

2018-11-05T12:22:27 <Bosmon> Hi there dandimitrov - your coverage for the branch now looks great
2018-11-05T12:22:38 <Bosmon> I\'ve added a small further report for a puzzling issue: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3499
2018-11-05T12:22:47 <Bosmon> I think we have seen something like this before but I\'m puzzled we don\'t see it all the time

2018-11-05T12:37:38 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: I\xe2\x80\x99ll might go on and use you\xe2\x80\x99re first suggestion - requiring the gpii-windows
2018-11-05T12:37:46 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - sounds good to me
2018-11-05T12:37:53 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - Any ideas why you don\'t see this?
2018-11-05T12:38:24 <dandimitrov> I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit frustrated with something else - gpii-glob takes a lot of time to load
2018-11-05T12:38:38 <Bosmon> Very wierd
2018-11-05T12:39:39 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: well, when we run a `npm install` all dependent modules\xe2\x80\x99 dependencies are installed equally in the node_modules folder
2018-11-05T12:39:56 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - I see
2018-11-05T12:40:06 <Bosmon> In theory I am running the same vagrant box as CI
2018-11-05T12:40:08 <dandimitrov> meaining that gpii-app/node_modules/gpii-universal is present
2018-11-05T12:40:19 <Bosmon> So I don\'t know why my npm is doing it differently
2018-11-05T12:40:33 <Bosmon> Perhaps my box is slightly old
2018-11-05T12:40:40 <dandimitrov> hmm, don\xe2\x80\x99t have clue either...
2018-11-05T12:41:24 * alanharnum has quit
2018-11-05T12:41:26 <dandimitrov> hmm, what version of npm is it using?
2018-11-05T12:41:42 * Alia has quit
2018-11-05T12:42:51 <Bosmon> npm 5.6.0
2018-11-05T12:43:05 <Bosmon> But I guess this module layout decision is essentially unstable anyway so we should be resistant to it
2018-11-05T12:44:07 <dandimitrov> yep, we\xe2\x80\x99d definatelly have to change it
2018-11-05T12:44:29 <dandimitrov> it\xe2\x80\x99s am interesting questoin though

2018-11-05T13:30:41 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: I get - https://pastebin.com/0kM9DQ2b when I require gpii-windows in the Grunt task. Seems like a problem with the node version (similar to the Electron 3.x problem) but from what I see for grunt, it should be using the global node
2018-11-05T13:36:11 <stegru> I\'ve also had the "Cannot find gpii-universal" error - I thought it was my own fault

2018-11-05T15:58:55 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @Justin_o, I figured out the root cause and put in a pull to fix the "undefined ms" messages: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/943
2018-11-05T15:59:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I was really ready to accept total blame for it as an integration problem, turns out it was just a variable name that needed to be updated.
2018-11-05T15:59:31 <the-t-in-rtf> smallest. pull. ever.
2018-11-05T15:59:42 <the-t-in-rtf> well, maybe not, but very tiny.
