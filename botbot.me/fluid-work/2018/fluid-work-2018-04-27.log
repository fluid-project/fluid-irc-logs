2018-04-27T19:27:20 <cindyli> sgithens: my 2630 branch now has the preferences server as a separate kettle server
2018-04-27T19:27:46 * alanharnum has quit
2018-04-27T19:29:35 <cindyli> if you ran "npm run test:vagrantProduction" in the universal root directory, the docker image in the universal will rebuild and it will starts these 3 things that you are interested:
2018-04-27T19:29:45 <cindyli> the preferences server at port 9081
2018-04-27T19:29:51 <cindyli> the flow manager at port 9082
2018-04-27T19:29:56 <cindyli> the couchdb at port 5984
2018-04-27T19:30:43 <cindyli> i\'ve modified vagrantfile to forward all these ports to the host machine, so you should be access http://localhost with different ports for different things
2018-04-27T19:31:30 <cindyli> also added a "--no-rebuild" option to vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh script
2018-04-27T19:32:12 <cindyli> by default, running "./script/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh" in a VM terminal will rebuild docker images and restart docker containers
2018-04-27T19:32:35 * Ria has quit
2018-04-27T19:33:23 <cindyli> running "./script/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh --no-rebuild" will only remove and restart docker containers from the existing universal docker image. it won\'t rebuild the image, which saves quite a bit time
