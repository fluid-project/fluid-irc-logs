2018-07-05T09:46:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @amatas[m].  I confirmed that both the latest stable release and the new EAP version still have the wiki editor for comments, descriptions, et cetera.
2018-07-05T09:47:07 <the-t-in-rtf> (of JIRA, I mean)
2018-07-05T10:09:05 <amatas[m]> the-t-in-rtf: yes, it seems a default feature. Despite I always try to use the text editor because the visual editor sometimes does weird things to the text
2018-07-05T10:09:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I think you miss my piont.
2018-07-05T10:09:50 <the-t-in-rtf> s/piont/point/
2018-07-05T10:10:01 <the-t-in-rtf> The point is there are still two editors even if the one we don\'t like is the default.
2018-07-05T10:10:21 <the-t-in-rtf> With Confluence they eventually got rid of the text-based wiki editor altogether.
2018-07-05T10:11:23 <amatas[m]> gotcha
2018-07-05T10:11:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I check specifically this time because they are in the middle of a big UI refresh.
2018-07-05T10:11:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Thankfully it seems limited to style and doesn\'t change the features.
2018-07-05T10:12:01 <amatas[m]> so what options do we have?
2018-07-05T10:12:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Seems like we can upgrade to 7.10 without any unusual concerns.
2018-07-05T10:12:36 <the-t-in-rtf> But we should check the compatibility of the third-party Git plugin.
2018-07-05T10:12:50 <the-t-in-rtf> (I\'m doing that right now)
2018-07-05T10:14:35 <amatas[m]> perhaps it\'s worth to rethink if we need that plugin. Because it seems to me and some other people that the plugin doesn\'t do what we expect: Show commit info in each jira ticket
2018-07-05T10:15:33 <the-t-in-rtf> There are about three dozen git plugins for JIRA.
2018-07-05T10:16:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I think it would be good to write up what people feel is missing and look through those to see if there are any options.
2018-07-05T10:18:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I agree we do need to rethink, two half-working plugins is not great, I only avoided going deep on that last night because Sergey and others were off.
2018-07-05T10:18:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Just prepping a bit for that conversation.
2018-07-05T10:19:36 <amatas[m]> ok, can we start a ticket with the info of the git plugins?
2018-07-05T10:19:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I think that\'s a good idea, and I\'ll start it.
2018-07-05T10:19:50 <amatas[m]> I think that it\'s a good way to track all the findings and progress
2018-07-05T10:20:13 <amatas[m]> thanks!

2018-07-05T14:24:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that\'s the opposite of what we want.
2018-07-05T14:24:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, anyone can enshrine their own opinion and way of working.
2018-07-05T14:24:34 <the-t-in-rtf> We want projects that enable a range of styles and ways of working.

2018-07-05T14:27:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, their standard rules don\'t even support the browser as an environment, I guess they expect you to add it.
2018-07-05T14:28:36 <the-t-in-rtf> This is interesting: https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/blob/master/eslintrc.json#L22
2018-07-05T14:28:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I didn\'t realise that you could indicate that a global was read only, that\'s useful.
2018-07-05T14:29:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Jeez, they completely an always disallow semicolons.

2018-07-05T14:30:02 <the-t-in-rtf> I once told a colleague (also a programmer) that programmers are opinions with legs who can touch type.
2018-07-05T14:30:07 <the-t-in-rtf> he said "some of them can\'
2018-07-05T14:30:10 <the-t-in-rtf> t touch type"
2018-07-05T14:31:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I like packages that give flexibility and leave it to users and communities to agree their best practices.

2018-07-05T14:48:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have another question about a comment you left on my PF for FLUID-6175. You had asked that fluid.orator.domReader.queueSpeech (https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/26f59522503494d4a6e0a6ecbfcf94e07c815e67/src/components/orator/js/Orator.js#L292-L309) be changed. "Also, it would be better to structure this activity as an event pipeline with namespaced listeners, which will make it easier to chop and change
2018-07-05T14:48:38 <Justin_o> implementations for mocking. In that way we should be able to get rid of the peculiar "speechFn" argument"
2018-07-05T14:49:15 <Justin_o> did you mean to do something like https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataSource.js#L176-L181
2018-07-05T14:49:19 <Justin_o> using fluid.promise

2018-07-05T15:05:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, like that
2018-07-05T15:05:49 <Bosmon> Or just functions, if they didn\'t need to be asynchronous
2018-07-05T15:06:14 <Bosmon> But yes, you get a promise out of the top-level activity
2018-07-05T15:06:18 <Justin_o> when you say just functions, i assume you mean without promises, but what is the best way to chain them

2018-07-05T16:25:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think i understand what you mean now. There is still a promise for the whole chain, but the individual listeners don\'t have to return promises, they can just be functions.
