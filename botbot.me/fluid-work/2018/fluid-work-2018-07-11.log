b"2018-07-11T18:45:59 <simonjb> the tests that fail for me are 51, 57, and 74
2018-07-11T18:52:31 <Justin_o> simonjb: have you tried running the tests in the vagrant box? i believe they should all pass there
2018-07-11T18:52:44 <simonjb> Justin_o: I will try that, thanks
2018-07-11T18:52:53 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks, please let me know how that goes
2018-07-11T18:52:59 <simonjb> Justin_o: will do

2018-07-11T19:13:17 <simonjb> Justin_o: all tests pass in FF in the Fedora Infusion Vagrant box
2018-07-11T19:13:34 <simonjb> thanks!
2018-07-11T19:14:01 <Justin_o> simonjb: great.. i wonder what's different about the vagrant vm and your linux environment.. were they running the same version of FF?
2018-07-11T19:15:10 <simonjb> Justin_o: Only very minor FF version difference: 61.0.1 vs 61.0
2018-07-11T19:15:55 <Justin_o> hmm.. i wouldn't think that would matter

2018-07-11T19:16:38 <simonjb> seems unlikely
2018-07-11T19:16:59 <simonjb> I do have zooming configured at my display level
2018-07-11T19:17:07 <simonjb> but browser is 100%
2018-07-11T19:17:37 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess it could be related to that. Perhaps it affects the rendering in FF but not chrome...
2018-07-11T19:17:40 <simonjb> I'll try setting my display zoom to 100%
2018-07-11T19:17:43 <simonjb> yes
2018-07-11T19:17:48 <Justin_o> thanks for looking into that
2018-07-11T19:21:07 <simonjb> Justin_o: no, still fails with display scaling at 100%
2018-07-11T19:21:27 <simonjb> though I didn't try logged out and back in
2018-07-11T19:21:42 <simonjb> but I did restart FF and it is rendering differently (smaller)
2018-07-11T19:21:52 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay, so it would seem okay
2018-07-11T19:22:02 <Justin_o> simonjb: are the iframes in FF and chrome rendering at the same size?
2018-07-11T19:22:08 <Justin_o> in that specific test
2018-07-11T19:22:54 <simonjb> Justin_o: no Chrome is still smaller
2018-07-11T19:23:07 <simonjb> Justin_o: let me try logged out and back in...
2018-07-11T19:23:22 <simonjb> I will be gone for a little time...

2018-07-11T19:27:19 <simonjb> Justin_o: oh, oh, oh, I just remembered to get FF to scale text on Linux, you need to set a config setting (which I have set)
2018-07-11T19:27:32 <simonjb> I will turn it off and test
2018-07-11T19:28:02 <Justin_o> simonjb: ah... that could be it
2018-07-11T19:31:18 <simonjb> ok that was it Justin_o
2018-07-11T19:31:24 <simonjb> tests now passing
2018-07-11T19:31:49 <simonjb> I had layout.css.devPixelsPerPx set to 1.25
2018-07-11T19:32:00 <simonjb> it's the FF global scaling
2018-07-11T19:32:10 <simonjb> when I set it to 1.0
2018-07-11T19:32:14 <simonjb> the tests pass

2018-07-11T19:38:50 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks for your help and good to figure out what the issue was
2018-07-11T19:39:40 <simonjb> scaling for FF is a little funky on Linux: some parts scale with the display setting but others (the content) don't
2018-07-11T19:43:35 <Justin_o> hopefully one day the tests will pass on your machine without you having to change your display settings

b'2018-07-11T14:12:10 <cindyli> after this line: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/c22fbf7a77a7467ec4ebfd62a7666bc9b5547802/configs/app.production.json#L25
2018-07-11T14:14:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - isn\'t there a suitable "all in one" config they could inherit from instead?
2018-07-11T14:14:36 <Bosmon> Since the config they call "production" isn\'t really production is it
2018-07-11T14:14:48 <Bosmon> The real production config would bind to the port in the cloud
2018-07-11T14:14:56 <Bosmon> Although I don\'t know what we\'re planning to do about this with our own production configs
2018-07-11T14:15:02 <cindyli> Bosmon: they could inherit from "%gpii-universal/gpii/configs/gpii.config.development.all.local.json5", which is same as what their dev config: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/c22fbf7a77a7467ec4ebfd62a7666bc9b5547802/configs/app.dev.json
2018-07-11T14:15:23 <cindyli> but i\'m not sure if there\'s anything special they need from gpii.config.all.development.dr.production.json5
2018-07-11T14:15:42 <Bosmon> Well, we should bear in mind that the decisions they make here will be the REAL ones
2018-07-11T14:15:52 <Bosmon> That is, they will determine what actually happens in the installers that jhernandez builds
2018-07-11T14:15:58 <Bosmon> So we should make sure we get this aligned properly
2018-07-11T14:17:27 <jhernandez> for the record, in gpii-app we have 3 configs. These are dev, testing and production
2018-07-11T14:19:09 <jhernandez> where production is meant to be the one used by when we\'re ready to start using the "production" cloud
2018-07-11T14:19:39 <jhernandez> cindyli: and Bosmon ^^
2018-07-11T14:19:50 <cindyli> jhernandez: if so, the untrusted config should be used
2018-07-11T14:20:27 <jhernandez> from within the gpii-app config we can make use of distributeOptions to, for example, point our app to use a particular cloud environment
2018-07-11T14:20:30 <cindyli> that is: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.untrusted.development.json5
2018-07-11T14:21:08 <cindyli> this config accepts an env var "GPII_CLOUD_URL" to accept the url to the cloud flow manager
2018-07-11T14:21:41 <cindyli> of course, you can also use distributeOptions to override https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.untrusted.development.json5#L12
2018-07-11T14:21:49 <jhernandez> but since we can\'t use the env variable when on electron, we should use distributeOptions to inject that URL in
2018-07-11T14:22:33 <cindyli> by default for testing purpose, this config expects the CBFM started locally at http://localhost:8084
2018-07-11T14:22:39 <jhernandez> also, we would need a config that uses the deviceReporter in production mode - this is, that uses the dynamic device reporter
2018-07-11T14:23:12 <jhernandez> cindyli: okay, then that\'s good for the "testing" config
2018-07-11T14:23:26 <cindyli> ah ha, sounds like we should create a new config that has untrusted + dynamic device reporter
2018-07-11T14:23:36 <jhernandez> cindyli: yup
2018-07-11T14:23:40 <jhernandez> :)
2018-07-11T14:25:15 <cindyli> jhernandez: would you be able to create one? or you want me to create it?
2018-07-11T14:26:00 <georgitodorov> cindyli, jhernandez, Bosmon: So, for the testing config we should use https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.untrusted.development.json5 with a distribute options to override the GPII_CLOUD_URL?
2018-07-11T14:26:24 <georgitodorov> What should that URL be?
2018-07-11T14:26:42 <cindyli> georgitodorov: from what jhernandez describes, this config might be missing dynamic device reporter
2018-07-11T14:26:45 <jhernandez> cindyli: I can do it for sure, which branch are you working on right now?
2018-07-11T14:27:02 <jhernandez> (I mean the branch where you\'re updating our configs)
2018-07-11T14:28:14 <cindyli> jhernandez: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-1990, you may wanna use master because i\'m still solving an issue with restructured untrusted config
2018-07-11T14:28:29 <cindyli> georgitodorov: for now, you probably wanna start your own cloud locally

2018-07-11T14:29:31 <georgitodorov> cindyli: I am not familiar with this process. And I am not sure that I need it for the time being.
2018-07-11T14:30:24 <cindyli> mainly flow manager configs, which will affect many top level config, jhernandez
2018-07-11T14:31:38 <cindyli> georgitodorov: if you find you need a local cloud, jhernandez or I can help you to get familiar with the process.
2018-07-11T14:31:56 <cindyli> the production cloud is running at https://flowmanager.gpii.net/
2018-07-11T14:31:58 <jhernandez> cindyli: okay, I will take a look at it and check your branch, just in case there may be conflicts
2018-07-11T14:32:07 <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez
2018-07-11T14:33:03 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Thank you, I think I have what I need for now.
2018-07-11T14:33:05 * georgitodorov has quit
2018-07-11T14:33:10 <cindyli> georgitodorov: the production cloud is usable too but it may get redeployed from time to time based on the merges into the universal master, which means you may encounter down time and some unexpected behavior
2018-07-11T14:34:43 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: by the time we can start using the cloud, yes, the idea is to allow us to easily switch the cloud from the gpii-app config, this is what cindyli is working on

2018-07-11T18:16:01 <Justin_o> jhung: do you know if we use the jQuery ui contrast themes anywhere. We don\'t seem to use them within Infusion anymore.
2018-07-11T18:20:02 <jhung> Justin_o: Yeah I don\'t think we\'ve been using those for a long time now.
2018-07-11T18:20:52 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I\'ll send it for Monday then.
2018-07-11T18:21:19 <Justin_o> jhung: okay thanks.. i think i\'ll send a proposal out to fluid-work to remove them.
2018-07-11T18:21:46 <jhung> great Justin_o
2018-07-11T18:22:18 <jhung> It may be useful to indicate when and where they were last used to give context in the email Justin_o.

2018-07-11T18:40:09 <jhung> Sure Justin_o - thanks.
2018-07-11T18:43:15 <simonjb> hi Justin_o, this afternoon I am starting to look at Bosmon\'s FLUID-6148 PR (sorry for the delay guys!) and I noticed a test failure in FF on Linux. The failure is not specific to Antranig\'s branch and also happens on build.fluidproject.org. This is the test that is failing: https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/framework-tests/preferences/html/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditorResponsive-test.html
2018-07-11T18:43:34 <simonjb> it passes for me in Chrome
2018-07-11T18:43:41 <simonjb> is this a known issue?
2018-07-11T18:44:06 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks for looking at the FLUID-6148 PR.
2018-07-11T18:44:26 <Justin_o> I don\'t think that\'s a known issue. It may depend on if you have the browser zoomed.
2018-07-11T18:44:53 <simonjb> ah, interesting

2018-07-11T08:11:20 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig. Regarding the new version of gpii-windows - shall I install a more recent version of MSBuild tools?
2018-07-11T08:28:25 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, do
2018-07-11T08:28:42 <Bosmon> YOu should be able to see which version is required by looking into the definition of our current Windows vagrant box
2018-07-11T08:28:56 <Bosmon> Basically if you just check out gpii-windows and run "vagrant up" it will construct a VM with all the required tools
2018-07-11T08:29:18 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I am not using a virtual machine for running GPII
2018-07-11T08:29:24 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I know that
2018-07-11T08:29:34 <Bosmon> But if you construct one, you will find which tools it requires :)
2018-07-11T08:29:56 <Bosmon> BUt yes, I believe all you need to do is install a recent MSBuild
2018-07-11T08:33:23 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I believe this provisioning line is relevant: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/NpmInstall.ps1#L13
2018-07-11T08:34:08 <Bosmon> And this action is always relevant, but you probably have it already: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Npm.ps1#L8

2018-07-11T09:10:26 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, I finally managed to install a recent version of MSBuild
2018-07-11T09:11:00 <georgitodorov> I ran into an issue with the configurations of gpii-universal. It seems that they are json5 files now instead of json
2018-07-11T09:12:02 <georgitodorov> I renamed the references to them in the GPII app and when I try running the application using `npm run dev` there are the usual console messages about registering some modules and in the end the execution is terminated
2018-07-11T09:12:10 <georgitodorov> And no PSP is shown. The exit code is 0
2018-07-11T09:14:36 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, the app mysteriously detects that there is another gpii instance and closes. Now the command does not terminate but nor does the PSP show up in the tray...
2018-07-11T09:14:41 <georgitodorov> I will continue investigating
2018-07-11T09:18:19 <Bosmon> Cheers, georgitodorov
2018-07-11T09:18:26 <Bosmon> This is all highly valuable integration experience :)
2018-07-11T09:21:52 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I have some progress - it seems that the connection to the PSP channel cannot be established
2018-07-11T09:22:19 <georgitodorov> The PSP tries to connect to localhost:8081/pcpChannel. Has this been changed?
2018-07-11T09:22:53 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I don\'t believe so, but it could be that the name of the configuration you should be using as a parent has changed
2018-07-11T09:24:28 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: We were previously using gpii.config.development.all.local.json from gpii-universal and it seems that the same file is available only with a different extension (json5)
2018-07-11T09:24:37 <georgitodorov> I don\'t know if the contents differ though
2018-07-11T09:25:27 <Bosmon> Looks like this is the base config 2 levels up
2018-07-11T09:25:29 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.development.base.local.json5
2018-07-11T09:25:58 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I found it!
2018-07-11T09:26:06 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - excellent, what is the issue?
2018-07-11T09:26:20 <georgitodorov> It is now localhost:8081/pSpChannel
2018-07-11T09:26:33 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - terrible, I wonder how that typo happened
2018-07-11T09:26:33 <georgitodorov> with a small "s" :)
2018-07-11T09:26:48 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2018-07-11T09:26:50 <Bosmon> Of course
2018-07-11T09:26:59 <Bosmon> Well that makes perfect sense :)
2018-07-11T09:27:37 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Yes, it does. Now that the application is running, I will do some very basic smoke testing to make sure the app is working
2018-07-11T09:27:45 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - really great, thanks
2018-07-11T09:27:51 <georgitodorov> and I will push the changes to the PR that I opened yesterday
2018-07-11T09:28:05 <georgitodorov> How can we proceed with the integration afterwards?
2018-07-11T09:30:09 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - which aspect are you asking about?
2018-07-11T09:31:10 <Bosmon> georgitodorov actually you and the team will be interested to read the summary document of our whole-team chat last night: https://pad.gpii.net/p/cloudsafe-aug-deployment-3pb4nxz
2018-07-11T09:31:35 <Bosmon> Where we collect together all the integration steps that will be needed so that we can start performing regular integration testing of the QSS/PSP
2018-07-11T09:32:10 <Bosmon> The rest of the team will contribute all the JIRAs necessary for this activity by the end of today, and then Sandra will begin timelining an overall plan
2018-07-11T09:32:34 <Bosmon> I guess the "Installer Creation Workflow" at line 90 will be particularly interesting to you
2018-07-11T09:33:27 <Bosmon> I will shortly merge Cindy\'s GPII-2965 branch which enables saving of preferences via the PSP channel, and this will create new builds of gpii-universal and windows
2018-07-11T09:33:31 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, thank you for that, we will take a look.
2018-07-11T09:33:55 <Bosmon> And then you can update your integration and then start experimenting with the saving of preferences, at least via the peculiar workflow of FIRST keying in and THEN operating the QSS
2018-07-11T09:34:26 <Bosmon> Then I will start work on GPII-3088 which will allow the QSS to work whilst "not keyed in", which will cause a bit of fresh integration disruption because the semantic of the PSP channel will have to change a bit
2018-07-11T09:34:40 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, sounds like a plan. Ping me when the branch is merged :)
2018-07-11T09:34:42 <Bosmon> In that you will get apparent "session data" even when there is not actually a keyed in user
2018-07-11T09:35:06 <Bosmon> There will just be a special user named "noUser" which you will have to detect and interpret within the PSP interface as meaning that no user is keyed in
2018-07-11T09:35:33 <Bosmon> But will allow you from within the QSS to issue updates via the existing protocol when users operate the buttons
2018-07-11T09:37:02 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, in this case we can also perform some work related to the "noUser" and then just hook it up with the work on your end
2018-07-11T09:59:26 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - sounds great!

2018-07-11T12:30:59 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I\'m imagining that whilst we have shelved all the requirements for expanding test coverage, we will need to allocate at least some time for repairing the existing tests which might have broken
2018-07-11T12:31:19 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Yes, I am doing this right now :)
2018-07-11T12:31:53 <georgitodorov> And we also have 5 points for QSS tests for version 1.0 which should ensure at least some basic QSS coverage

2018-07-11T12:32:37 <georgitodorov> I noticed that the integration tests hang on the listener for the `onPSPReady` event
2018-07-11T12:32:45 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon and @sgithens, looks like gpii-express-user was updated recently enough that it just works with updated deps.  I will submit a branch once I address any linting concerns brought in by the new version of eslint-config-fluid.
2018-07-11T12:33:16 <the-t-in-rtf> atoms!  one two three SIX of them.
2018-07-11T12:33:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, all of six errors.
2018-07-11T12:33:23 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Have there been any changes that may have resulted in that behavior?
2018-07-11T12:35:40 <georgitodorov> Or, do I need to update something else as well? I saw that there is a new version of gpii-infusion, I updated to it but the event is still not captured.

2018-07-11T12:44:13 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - the change is probably just all due to the renaming of events
2018-07-11T12:45:13 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Actually, this is an event in the PSP itself. And the naming is correct
2018-07-11T12:45:43 <georgitodorov> I think there are a lot of errors if one is waiting for an event which is not defined
2018-07-11T12:48:41 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Ignore me...I have forgotten to rename the /pcpChannel to /pspChannel in the tests, as well
2018-07-11T12:49:07 <georgitodorov> And the event wasn\'t fired indeed...I thought I used find+replace :/

2018-07-11T13:14:52 <georgitodorov> Any ideas?
2018-07-11T13:16:32 <the-t-in-rtf> @georgitodorov, an ECONNREFUSED suggests that whatever it needs to communicate with is either not running or running on another port.
2018-07-11T13:16:58 <the-t-in-rtf> could just be an option that didn\'t get passed somewhere.
