2018-05-23T09:05:07 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I am reading up on publishing a scoped version of express-pouchdb.  I plan to release a scoped version of the current version, with luck this will also allow me to more easily update that package.
2018-05-23T09:05:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I hadn\'t actually managed a usable release since they went to a monorepo.
2018-05-23T09:05:50 <the-t-in-rtf> so most of the vulnerabilities reported by snyk come in via this package.
2018-05-23T09:09:46 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that sounds great
2018-05-23T09:23:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll test with it scoped to @the-t-in-rtf, we can discuss moving that to @gpii once we know it actually works.
2018-05-23T09:23:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I have to actually scope the forked package first, that went fine.
2018-05-23T09:24:30 <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.npmjs.com/package/@the-t-in-rtf/pouchdb-all-dbs
2018-05-23T09:24:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Future scoped versions will have a note about the fact that it\'s forked and instructions to publish it.
2018-05-23T09:37:39 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - ok, that looks great
2018-05-23T09:37:45 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s better to have turtles all the way down
2018-05-23T09:38:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m having to pick apart a copy of their prepublish script, they munge the sub-package package.json files to bring in information from the monorepo.
2018-05-23T09:38:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Hopefully that will be a "before lunch" type of task rather than an "all day" one.
2018-05-23T09:47:24 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - wow, that\'s interesting
2018-05-23T09:47:32 <Bosmon> Well at least it hopefully won\'t be a totally unedifying task
2018-05-23T09:47:40 <Bosmon> Since we will need to learn how to do something similar in fluid-publish
2018-05-23T09:47:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I managed it, I think.
2018-05-23T09:47:43 <Bosmon> Once it becomes monorepo-capable
2018-05-23T09:47:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Just trying a manual publish of the combined material.
2018-05-23T09:48:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll probably branch what I do and submit it for a review between the two of us.
2018-05-23T10:24:51 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, give this version of gpii-pouchdb a try: 1.0.12-dev.20180523T102341Z.d742612
2018-05-23T10:25:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll have to write up some notes, it was a fairly manual process to clean up the generated package.json.
2018-05-23T10:25:40 * kasparnet has quit
2018-05-23T10:26:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I may just check that in and only regenerate it as needed.
2018-05-23T10:27:02 <the-t-in-rtf> since we care not at all about the rest of the packages.

2018-05-23T11:17:46 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-05-23T11:24:53 <Bosmon> Hey there stegru - I found something funny
2018-05-23T11:25:04 <Bosmon> The user listeners are requiring "request" - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/userListeners/src/listeners.js#L21
2018-05-23T11:25:09 <Bosmon> But we never listed it in package.json
2018-05-23T11:25:22 <Bosmon> It seems to have worked by accident since it was brought in by some other library....
2018-05-23T11:25:28 <Bosmon> npm is certainly a bit terrifying these days
2018-05-23T11:30:31 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - gpii-pouchdb release is looking good
2018-05-23T11:31:19 <stegru> oh yes, Bosmon!
2018-05-23T11:31:44 <Bosmon> stegru - it\'s also a bit crusty since all the URLs are hardcoded etc, but I guess this is all somewhat provisional code
2018-05-23T11:32:00 <Bosmon> Given we\'ve bundled the listeners in-process, shouldn\'t we just notify the system via function call?
2018-05-23T11:32:28 <stegru> well, I just copied what the PSP does
2018-05-23T11:32:30 <stegru> (or did)
2018-05-23T11:32:37 <Bosmon> I guess we\'ll need to evaluate for the pilots whether its going to be appropriate to expose any HTTP interfaces over localhost
2018-05-23T11:33:06 <Bosmon> But my suspicion is that it will probably not be
2018-05-23T11:34:05 <stegru> no, I don\'t think it is
2018-05-23T11:34:30 <Bosmon> OK, I\'d better write this up as a task
2018-05-23T11:34:38 <stegru> the precedent: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/src/main/app.js#L409
2018-05-23T11:35:04 <Bosmon> If dandimitrov_ told you to jump off a cliff, would you do it? : P
2018-05-23T11:35:28 <stegru> well, I don\'t think there\'s any immediate problem with just listening on localhost - but it currently listens on all interfaces
2018-05-23T11:35:53 <Bosmon> ok
2018-05-23T11:36:15 <stegru> on the same network, I could key in on your machine from mine
2018-05-23T11:36:38 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-05-23T11:36:47 <Bosmon> I remember the good old days
2018-05-23T11:37:14 <Bosmon> When you could just log in to someone else\'s host and type "echo "You are hit by some water" > /dev/tty9
2018-05-23T11:37:19 <Bosmon> Oh the fun we had
2018-05-23T11:37:24 <stegru> ha!
2018-05-23T11:38:34 <stegru> I think I\'ve solved this problem already
2018-05-23T11:38:46 <Bosmon> You usually have
2018-05-23T11:40:08 <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/gpii-iod/blob/GPII-2972/configs/gpii-iod.production.json#L20
2018-05-23T11:40:32 <Bosmon> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3078
2018-05-23T11:41:45 <stegru> passing an object to the "port" option of a kettle server, instead of a number, uses a different overload of net.listen (or whatever the function is)
2018-05-23T11:47:07 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: IDRC maintenance starting in 15min
2018-05-23T11:47:19 <stegru> network sockets are a form of IPC, and there is almost no difference between a socket listening on localhost, and "IPC" - in terms of only processes on the localhost can access it
2018-05-23T11:48:02 <stegru> oh gtirloni, did you know one of the IP address that ci.gpii.net points to doesn\'t work? (not important, thought I\'d mention it)
2018-05-23T11:49:33 <gtirloni> stegru: i didn\'t know that, thanks for the heads up
2018-05-23T11:49:42 <gtirloni> amatas: ^^^ could one of the gpii LBs be faulty?

2018-05-23T11:52:56 <amatas> stegru, gtirloni: I didn\'t get any errors this morning. Let me check
2018-05-23T11:58:48 <amatas> nginx on  205.211.169.37 is not running
2018-05-23T11:58:59 <amatas> nginx: [emerg] open() "/var/run/nginx.pid" failed (13: Permission denied)
2018-05-23T12:00:15 <amatas> the restart failed, but a stop/start worked
2018-05-23T12:00:17 <amatas> odd
2018-05-23T12:01:06 <gtirloni> amatas: is it okay if I start the maintenance now or do you want some minutes?
2018-05-23T12:01:26 <amatas> I think it\'s ok to run the maintenance
2018-05-23T12:01:30 <gtirloni> thanks
2018-05-23T12:01:48 <amatas> I\'m not going to do anything else on the LBs
2018-05-23T12:02:02 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: IDRC maintenance starting

2018-05-23T13:00:13 <georgitodorov> The CI job has again failed for some reason - as far as I can tell, not because of a PSP test failure
2018-05-23T13:00:50 <georgitodorov> Can you retrigger the tests? And afterwards merge the branch if everything looks good to you?

2018-05-23T13:28:36 <Bosmon> Hi there amatas or amatas[m] - do you have an idea what was the fate of this CI run? https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-tests/250/
2018-05-23T13:28:56 <Bosmon> It is reported "detached" but the github UI thinks it is still in progress
2018-05-23T13:29:17 <Bosmon> Is it ok to fire a further "ok to test" in such a case, or do I need to do something explicit to cancel the run?
2018-05-23T13:39:00 <amatas> hi Bosmon, sorry but I can not find why Jenkins aborted all the jobs at that time. Perhaps it was because the job was running when the IDRC was in maintenance? gtirloni?
2018-05-23T13:39:40 <amatas> Bosmon: an "ok to test" should be enough to trigger another job
2018-05-23T13:39:52 * jhernandez_ joined the channel
2018-05-23T13:40:06 <Bosmon> OK, thanks amatas

2018-05-23T13:40:37 <Bosmon> It looks like it is going
2018-05-23T13:40:40 <amatas> in order to update the Github status
2018-05-23T13:40:59 <Bosmon> It says "Started by Naginator after the failure of build #250"

2018-05-23T13:57:11 <gtirloni> could be the maintenance, although i\'m not sure about the timing but it\'s very close to it (although it was already finished by that time)

2018-05-23T16:23:05 <simonjb> jeevan_: I think it\'s better to include the full license so that everything is in one place; it\'s possible that the license changes and we\'d want to record the license that was in place when we copied the code
