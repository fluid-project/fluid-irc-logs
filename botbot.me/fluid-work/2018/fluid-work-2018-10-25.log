2018-10-25T08:38:38 <the-t-in-rtf> @jhernandez (or anyone), is there a dev release of universal that uses the new package name?
2018-10-25T08:39:06 <the-t-in-rtf> or is that only for the npm package name?
2018-10-25T08:39:06 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: which new package name?
2018-10-25T08:39:11 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-universal

2018-10-25T08:41:03 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: right, it\'s the npm package name
2018-10-25T08:41:25 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will keep using universal for other stuff, but that\'s a bit confusing.
2018-10-25T08:41:55 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we should be used to it with fluid = require("infusion") and all

2018-10-25T08:45:05 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: gpii/windows uses universal it that way
2018-10-25T08:45:14 <jhernandez> s/it/in
2018-10-25T08:45:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I realise that now.  I was just having to update a package.json in an older repo to use gpii-universal and just assumed it was across the board from a particular version
2018-10-25T08:46:15 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. that the name change was not just in the npm package name.
2018-10-25T08:46:31 <the-t-in-rtf> what do you have to do to publish it with a name other than the name in the package.json?
2018-10-25T08:46:48 <the-t-in-rtf> are there extra args that you have to use for fluid-publish, or do you do it manually or something?
2018-10-25T08:47:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess you must be using fluid-publish from the dev releases.

2018-10-25T13:42:10 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: sorry the-t-in-rtf, I had to leave for paperwork and I\'m just reading this
2018-10-25T13:42:53 <jhernandez> no extra magic, look at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L2
2018-10-25T13:43:25 <jhernandez> so I just run fluid-publish, that\'s all
2018-10-25T13:44:26 <jhernandez> the repo is called universal but the package is called gpii-universal
2018-10-25T13:45:50 <jhernandez> and by having fluid=require("gpii-universal") is enough
2018-10-25T13:51:08 * simonjb joined the channel
2018-10-25T14:12:18 * georgitodorov has quit
2018-10-25T14:17:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, my point is that fluid.require("%universal") is still a thing.
2018-10-25T14:18:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I use that and fluid.module.resolvePath a lot to pick up sub-modules, test fixtures, etc
2018-10-25T14:19:09 <the-t-in-rtf> if the idea is that everything but the repo should be gpii-universal, then index.js also needs to be updated.
2018-10-25T14:19:51 <the-t-in-rtf> there\'s no reason we couldn\'t register it as both as a transitional approach

2018-10-25T15:21:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do we have a method or is there a recommended approach for injecting scripts and waiting for them to load before trying to execute its code
2018-10-25T15:21:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there\'s the approaches we used in Fluid Engage in 2008 :)
2018-10-25T15:21:53 <Justin_o> i\'m currently trying to inject the script tag and use jQuery\'s .on("load", func) to resolve a promise, but the event doesn\'t seem to be firing
2018-10-25T15:24:18 * alanharnum2 joined the channel
2018-10-25T15:25:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - perhaps you have done the registration in the wrong order
2018-10-25T15:25:29 <Bosmon> Have you tried experimenting with a raw "onload" attribute?
2018-10-25T15:25:52 <Justin_o> this is my latest attempt
2018-10-25T15:26:02 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CryfEmSQ/
2018-10-25T15:26:12 <Justin_o> i haven\'t tried the raw "unload" attribute
2018-10-25T15:27:44 <Justin_o> with the above snippet the tag is injected and the src file does show up. If i resolve outside of the load event i can access the code
2018-10-25T15:49:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - don\'t see any reason why that shouldn\'t work
2018-10-25T15:54:48 <Bosmon> Just for anyone who this might be relevant to, I\'m getting very slow downloads from idrc.cachefly.net
2018-10-25T15:55:16 <Bosmon> Less than 1MB/sec which is less than 10% of what I might expect
2018-10-25T15:55:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. i thought it looked okay.. thanks for verifying
2018-10-25T15:58:01 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - fluid.require("%universal") is a thing only for you : P
2018-10-25T15:58:45 <Bosmon> I have no idea why it should work on any even slightly recent version of the package
2018-10-25T15:59:28 <Bosmon> The package was officially renamed 8 months ago, and we believe we caught it everywhere: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/548

2018-10-25T16:31:42 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon I was using the latest dev release of gpii-universal, it\'s wrong there.
2018-10-25T16:31:56 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-10-25T16:32:07 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I dispute your statement
2018-10-25T16:32:30 <Bosmon> There are no references to the text %universal in current trunk
2018-10-25T16:32:46 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, not sure what\'s going on then
2018-10-25T16:32:58 <the-t-in-rtf> but you\'re right
2018-10-25T16:33:41 <the-t-in-rtf> basically I was getting failures resolve universal using fluid.require in a docker container (but not on my machine)
2018-10-25T16:34:19 <the-t-in-rtf> could be a node version issue, I\'ll have to rip out my fix (require-ing it) and document the issue
