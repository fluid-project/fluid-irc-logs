b'2018-01-03T23:12:47 <mrtyler> ussjoin: ah yes, thanks for that and for the links yesterday
2018-01-03T23:13:00 <mrtyler> (esp the pythonsweetness one, which was not as widely circulated as the register article)
2018-01-03T23:13:13 <ussjoin> It does appear to be OMGWTFBBQ scale, at least for AWS/GCE/etc.
2018-01-03T23:13:20 <mrtyler> yeah
2018-01-03T23:13:43 <mrtyler> Testing also showed that an attack running on one virtual machine was able to access the physical memory of the host machine, and through that, gain read-access to the memory of a different virtual machine on the same host.
2018-01-03T23:14:47 <mrtyler> i wonder if we\'ll see a big uptick in use of Dedicated Instances?
2018-01-03T23:15:07 <ussjoin> Yeah, that\'s the full I Drink Your Milkshake, there.
2018-01-03T23:15:14 <mrtyler> HIPAA required them until like 6 months ago. i wonder if that will change back
2018-01-03T23:15:27 <ussjoin> Um... *shrug* Until ~early 2017... yeah, you beat me to that line. :-)
2018-01-03T23:15:41 <ussjoin> HIPAA didn\'t require them to the best of my knowledge, but AWS\' BAA *did* require them.
2018-01-03T23:15:51 <mrtyler> right, that
2018-01-03T23:15:56 <ussjoin> (So if you needed HIPAA on AWS, you had to use them.)
2018-01-03T23:16:18 <ussjoin> Maybe? Or AWS could fix its stuff. That $15k/mo/region penalty *murders* medium-scale businesses.
2018-01-03T23:16:38 <ussjoin> I don\'t know if GCE had/has a similar requirement, either.
2018-01-03T23:19:01 <ussjoin> https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/hipaa/ doesn\'t say either way. Obnoxiously. But if we end up needing to care, obviously we\'ll get an account manager there who can simply send us their BAA and we\'ll find out quickly.

2018-01-03T23:30:53 <ussjoin> https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/ssca -- the patch to fix Chrom(e|ium) won\'t be out until Jan 23.
2018-01-03T23:31:00 <mrtyler> right. looking up information for ourselves is for plebes anyway ;)
2018-01-03T23:31:53 <ussjoin> mrtyler: If you know where there\'s a copy of the Google Cloud BAA implementation guide, I\'d love to see one; I just don\'t have one at hand. Hence my link to the cloud.google.com page which might have said it, but doesn\'t.
2018-01-03T23:32:36 <mrtyler> i was just agreeing with your "when we care, we\'ll have an account manager who will do it for us" idea
2018-01-03T23:32:44 <mrtyler> i haven\'t looked into it at all
2018-01-03T23:33:22 <ussjoin> Ah, I see. Yeah, I meant less "I\'m not interested in looking it up" and more "I suspect that the documents I would need to confirm or deny my hypothesis are not publicly available."

2018-01-03T11:41:18 <kasper> hello there stegru
2018-01-03T11:41:28 <kasper> how was your christmas and NY?
2018-01-03T11:41:31 <stegru> hi kasper, happy new year
2018-01-03T11:41:51 <stegru> it was very good rtanks, yours?
2018-01-03T11:42:26 <kasper> really good, both of them!
2018-01-03T11:43:08 <kasper> I bumped into an annoying issue, which is most likely because of me, but I\'m doing my best to blame it on you
2018-01-03T11:43:13 <kasper> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2777
2018-01-03T11:43:58 <stegru> yes, i can see why you\'re trying to blame it on me
2018-01-03T11:44:07 <kasper> hehe
2018-01-03T11:44:08 <stegru> i\'ll see if i can blame it on you, instead
2018-01-03T11:45:11 <kasper> haha great
2018-01-03T11:45:28 <stegru> by the way, the link to the commit has a . on the end
2018-01-03T11:45:35 <kasper> ah, cheers - fixing
2018-01-03T11:46:50 <kasper> it\'s a bit odd, the issue, cause in a lot of ways, everything seems to be working like its supposed to - except for the sudden explosion due to a lack of some stupid process that was just there
2018-01-03T11:47:48 <kasper> stegru, btw, if I suddenly disappear, it\'s because my computer ran out of juice... I forgot my charger at home so will have to go work from there when it runs out
2018-01-03T11:48:02 <kasper> so should be no more than 15-20 mins
2018-01-03T11:48:17 <kasper> but I\'ll stay in the office by a decent size screen as long as possible
2018-01-03T11:48:18 <stegru> that\'s ok, i might too - my internet is broke, so i\'m tethering
2018-01-03T11:50:18 <stegru> my guess is it\'s because another magnifier process is being ran - it does this (behind the scenes) to remove itself from being integrated into the login screen
2018-01-03T11:50:52 <kasper> stegru, but this happened during the 3rd login/logout round
2018-01-03T11:50:55 <kasper> with the same user
2018-01-03T11:51:39 <kasper> or does this happen every time one starts/shut down the screen magnifier?
2018-01-03T11:52:07 <stegru> i think when it starts/shuts down
2018-01-03T11:52:22 <kasper> btw - noticed this worrying line https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/settingsHandlerUtilities.js#L242 ... although I cant really figure out how that could cause the issue we\'re seeing
2018-01-03T11:53:47 <kasper> stegru, so how would i confirm/dismiss your guess... would I check the number of hits on Mangify.exe, or something
2018-01-03T11:54:29 <kasper> https://github.com/kaspermarkus/windows/blob/98a3f51577f579051352815cfaa959ad619e8990/gpii/node_modules/processReporter/dotNetProcesses.csx#L60
2018-01-03T11:55:01 <kasper> oh, I guess that actually would be visible from the logs
2018-01-03T11:58:09 <stegru> i\'ll get it running on my machine
2018-01-03T11:58:25 <stegru> but you can use procmon and filter the process related events
2018-01-03T12:06:58 * Justin_o joined the channel
2018-01-03T12:09:56 <kasper> ok, so it does indeed look like there are two processes running
2018-01-03T12:10:12 <kasper> I\'m down to 3%, so I\'ll have to abandon ship and go home
2018-01-03T12:10:18 <kasper> will be back in a sec
2018-01-03T12:10:25 <kasper> or well, make that 15 mins

2018-01-03T12:53:37 <stegru> kasparnet: I can reproduce it
2018-01-03T12:59:37 <kasparnet> stegru, cool
2018-01-03T12:59:42 <kasparnet> I\'ve done a bit more triaging
2018-01-03T13:00:01 <kasparnet> and it looks like windows magnifier does some weird sort of three process thing
2018-01-03T13:00:16 <kasparnet> with the last one being the one that continues to stay running
2018-01-03T13:00:43 <kasparnet> and the error occurs when the .get call hits one of the first temporary processes
2018-01-03T13:01:48 <stegru> yes, that\'s what i noticed (about a year ago)
2018-01-03T13:02:11 <kasparnet> and on my machine, it\'s like 0.4 seconds from first process is launched to the final process is going
2018-01-03T13:03:00 <kasparnet> stegru, hmm... I\'m wondering what the hell to do about it
2018-01-03T13:03:12 <stegru> that\'s why I made the enableRegisteredAT function - it\'s not as simple as just starting the magnify.exe (same applies to the on screen keyboard, and others))
2018-01-03T13:03:46 <kasparnet> I guess i\'m not even quite sure why it\'s a problem, i.e. why things are exploding... It seems to me the system should be completely satisfied that _some_ process is runnning with magnify.exe
2018-01-03T13:03:54 * grrrero joined the channel
2018-01-03T13:04:17 <kasparnet> afaik we dont store the PID or anyting... only the fact that the process is running
2018-01-03T13:05:10 <stegru> i think the process bridge gets the pid of the temporary process, then by the time it uses the PID the process has gone
2018-01-03T13:05:31 <kasparnet> but what does it use the PID for?
2018-01-03T13:05:47 <stegru> gets more information about the process, I think
2018-01-03T13:05:52 <kasparnet> ah, I see
2018-01-03T13:06:16 <kasparnet> so, I guess some catch clause might do the trick
2018-01-03T13:06:37 <stegru> yeh.. but i\'m sure clown has done this already
2018-01-03T13:06:41 <kasparnet> telling the system that there is "no magnify.exe" process running, or perhaps even looping
2018-01-03T13:06:52 <kasparnet> ahhhhh... the plot thickens
2018-01-03T13:06:59 <kasparnet> (or whatever a plot does)
2018-01-03T13:07:29 <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/156
2018-01-03T13:08:49 <kasparnet> awesome... I\'ll try and merge that in and see if I can still reproduce GPII-2777
2018-01-03T13:09:42 <stegru> just tried it, and no errors
