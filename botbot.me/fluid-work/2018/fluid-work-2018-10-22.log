2018-10-22T11:51:04 <dandimitrov> Could you take a look at my progress on coverage report for the renderer processes?
2018-10-22T11:51:16 <dandimitrov> Here\xe2\x80\x99s a PR: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/51
2018-10-22T11:51:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> sure
2018-10-22T11:51:47 <dandimitrov> I\xe2\x80\x99ve included descriptions with the basic idea of the approach
2018-10-22T11:52:48 <dandimitrov> If you have some problem with github use: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/51/files to see the diff
2018-10-22T11:53:51 <dandimitrov> Something strange is happening with gihub there all morning\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-10-22T11:55:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> well, it\'ll be a bit before I\'m there
2018-10-22T11:55:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have to provision a Windows VM before I can even run npm install against your work... :)
2018-10-22T11:56:33 <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: I was wondering whether you can take a look at the code
2018-10-22T11:56:52 <the-t-in-rtf1> Sure, but I also want to look at the report.
2018-10-22T11:56:55 <dandimitrov> I\xe2\x80\x99m still having trouble with stability (it hangs sometimes)
2018-10-22T11:57:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> if you wanted to save some time, I often put reports on my github pages site.
2018-10-22T11:57:39 <the-t-in-rtf1> that way I can look at completeness while I\'m looking at your settings, etc.
2018-10-22T11:59:26 <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: ok then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll generate one and include it in the branch
2018-10-22T12:00:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> cool
2018-10-22T12:00:11 <the-t-in-rtf1> why did you have to fork the coverage sender?
2018-10-22T12:00:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, it should have worked with the right options passed to the client-serving middleware?
2018-10-22T12:00:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can comment on the pull as to what options you\'d need, but wanted to know if you tried it.

2018-10-22T12:04:13 <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: I\xe2\x80\x99ve included the report as well
2018-10-22T12:05:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> I see it.
2018-10-22T12:05:59 <dandimitrov> from what I understood the coverage sender hooks to the qunit in the BrowserWindow, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have it there
2018-10-22T12:17:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> interesting, what are your tests written in, then?
2018-10-22T12:19:11 <dandimitrov> I was thinking of collecting coverage on the basis of the tests in the main process
2018-10-22T12:24:29 <the-t-in-rtf1> so, right now the "afterCallback" that sends the data is only designed to hook into Testem or QUnit, but if that\'s the only reason you use it, I could update the bit that creates the coverage sender to expose a function you could use to trigger the sending.
2018-10-22T12:24:54 <the-t-in-rtf1> trying to see if we can avoid your having to figure out the IPC stuff and write a new client.
2018-10-22T12:25:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> just figuring out the IPC stuff will be headache enough.
2018-10-22T12:25:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> if the coverage sending function was available, could you just trigger that from the master process?
2018-10-22T12:26:07 <dandimitrov> that sound reasonable
2018-10-22T12:26:42 <dandimitrov> yes, sending function with a callback argument
2018-10-22T12:27:04 * jhung joined the channel
2018-10-22T12:27:34 <the-t-in-rtf1> we do something very similar with the webdriver library I use in some of my work
2018-10-22T12:27:54 <the-t-in-rtf1> just thinking through how to keep this simple and how to test it.
2018-10-22T12:28:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can probably have it stash the callback in its existing namespace
2018-10-22T12:29:03 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-10-22T12:29:10 <the-t-in-rtf1> so that way you\'re not having to assign variables and I don\'t have to return anything.
2018-10-22T12:36:00 <dandimitrov> the-t-in-rtf1: hmm, adding an options arg and binding it in the current usages might be enough :?
2018-10-22T12:37:21 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, something like options.exposeCallback?
2018-10-22T12:43:49 <Bosmon> Hi there the-t-in-rtf1 - it looks like our CI has gone mad and is rebuilding the same jobs endlessly?
2018-10-22T12:44:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> sorry to hear it.
2018-10-22T12:44:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> if you can give an example I can confirm whether I have any access to help (likely not)
2018-10-22T12:45:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> I had escalated powers for various proof-of-concept setups, but not really for the main builds.
2018-10-22T12:45:25 <the-t-in-rtf1> @dandimitrov https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3467
2018-10-22T12:45:37 <the-t-in-rtf1> I\'ve already actually done the work, it\'ll take a few minutes to write the tests.
2018-10-22T12:46:20 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pull-request/
2018-10-22T12:48:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, @Bosmon, I can disable the jobs, apparently.
2018-10-22T12:48:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> should I kill the ones waiting?
2018-10-22T12:48:13 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - please
2018-10-22T12:48:43 <the-t-in-rtf1> should I leave 103 running?
2018-10-22T12:48:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> does it serve a purpose, or is it retesting something we already know is good or bad?
2018-10-22T12:49:34 <the-t-in-rtf1> (the others are already dead)
2018-10-22T12:51:41 <the-t-in-rtf1> argh, the github outage is making it hard to actually look at the PR itself.
2018-10-22T12:52:03 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - it passed many times in the past
2018-10-22T12:52:17 <Bosmon> It was only ever a minor update to move our CI to node 10.x
2018-10-22T12:52:58 <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, that one is gone as well.
2018-10-22T12:53:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> I don\'t see it triggering new ones
2018-10-22T12:55:50 <Bosmon> phew
2018-10-22T12:55:52 <Bosmon> Thanks for that
2018-10-22T13:01:41 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - looks like it is continuing to endlessly trigger new jobs
2018-10-22T13:02:55 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, I see that.
2018-10-22T13:03:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - who is in charge of the IDRC CI these days?
2018-10-22T13:03:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: Alan is, but he\'s away today
2018-10-22T13:03:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - oops
2018-10-22T13:03:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can disable it for the day.
2018-10-22T13:03:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> but I know that\'s not handy.
2018-10-22T13:05:59 <Bosmon> Actually it seems to be a global phenomenon
2018-10-22T13:06:05 <Bosmon> I think GPII pulls are rebuilding endlessly too
2018-10-22T13:06:17 <Bosmon> Look at https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/153#issuecomment-431829246
2018-10-22T13:06:37 <Bosmon> We\'ve had a build every 15 minutes for the last 3 hours
2018-10-22T13:07:03 <Justin_o> the robots are taking over
2018-10-22T13:07:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i wonder if it\'s related to the github issues.. maybe they are sending the web hook continuously
2018-10-22T13:09:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: looking at the recent deliveries for infusion\'s web hook there were quite a few sent recently.. So i\'m thinking it may be an issue from the GitHub side.

2018-10-22T14:05:13 <the-t-in-rtf1> the tests should be much more instructive this time, they use the same options you\'ll need to when configuring the middleware that serves up the client.

2018-10-22T16:13:16 <jhernandez> I mean, reset it to yellowBlack?
2018-10-22T16:13:22 <stegru> same again
2018-10-22T16:13:47 <stegru> so when reset is click, you want it to go to yellowBlack?
2018-10-22T16:16:09 <jhernandez> yup
2018-10-22T16:16:24 <stegru> why would you want that?
2018-10-22T16:16:47 <jhernandez> that\'s what I was saying in the meeting
2018-10-22T16:16:48 <stegru> shouldn\'t it be setting it to the default?
2018-10-22T16:16:52 <jhernandez> is that worth?
2018-10-22T16:16:56 <stegru> sorry, i probably wasn\'t listening
2018-10-22T16:17:37 <stegru> oh ok ok, you want the ability to reset to a specific theme
