2018-01-25T15:42:06 <cindyli> jhung, clown_, do you have some time to chat with avtar and I to go through some aria stuff for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2774?
2018-01-25T15:42:27 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-01-25T15:42:42 <clown_> cindyli, one moment please.
2018-01-25T15:42:54 <cindyli> sure

2018-01-25T15:47:46 <jhung> cindyli: I have time now until standup and after 1pm.
2018-01-25T15:48:17 <cindyli> thanks, jhung. let\'s see if clown_ is available now
2018-01-25T15:52:37 <clown_> cindyli, jhung, avtar, I\'m looking at GPII-2774 just to see what you are talking about.
2018-01-25T15:53:59 <cindyli> clown_: are you available to meet now?
2018-01-25T15:54:00 <jhung> clown_, cindyli, avtar: Lisa may be a good resource to consult with as well.
2018-01-25T15:54:12 <clown_> indeed, jhung
2018-01-25T15:55:11 <cindyli> seems Lisa isn\'t online now
2018-01-25T15:55:51 <jhung> She is online in #fluid-design cindyli
2018-01-25T15:56:03 <cindyli> ah, thanks

2018-01-25T16:35:49 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni, thanks for the new Fedora VM.  I was working with Windows VMs earlier, they\'re starting to complain about licensing.  Just checking the timing for the next one of those.
2018-01-25T16:37:45 <stegru> jhernandez: i\'ve fixed the tray icon - we can stop crying now. it\'s in PILOT2 branch of my gpii-wix-installer
2018-01-25T16:38:31 <jhernandez> stegru: thanks!
2018-01-25T16:39:02 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: running "slmgr.vbs -rearm" should stop it complaining for a few months
2018-01-25T16:40:11 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'ll wait until your job passes CI, and if it does, I\'ll build an installer right away with the new bits for Kavya to test

2018-01-25T17:12:12 <gmoss> "This has gotten crazy out of hand, I apologize but we will no longer be selling PonziCoin on this site because this was a joke. I cannot terminate the contract but I will not be selling any coins that I own."
2018-01-25T17:12:17 <gmoss> amazing
2018-01-25T17:15:43 <clown> "Q: Is this site secure?
2018-01-25T17:15:43 <clown> A: We use Equifax-grade security."
2018-01-25T17:21:47 <gtirloni> amatas_: were you able to find the ssh key? https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/container-gpii-staging.yml#L7    https://ci.gpii.net/credentials/
2018-01-25T17:21:54 <ussjoin> That seems about par for the course, both on business plan and on security plan.
2018-01-25T17:23:05 <amatas_> gtirloni: I can see the hash of the private part, but I need the public part to save it in the i-0028 host
2018-01-25T17:24:04 <gtirloni> amatas_: maybe this one: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ops-shared/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/all#L42
2018-01-25T17:24:33 <amatas_> thanks gtirloni, will try

2018-01-25T18:59:04 <colinclark> I could do any time between now and 3 pm or the time we previously scheduled
2018-01-25T18:59:08 <colinclark> which i know is a bit tight for jhernandez
