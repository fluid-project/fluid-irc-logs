2018-08-17T15:35:48 <gmoss> Justin_o: ping
2018-08-17T15:39:23 <gmoss> or anyone else familiar with the preferences editor lazyLoad: I\'ve been working on implementing i18n/l10n in UIO, and part of that has been to get the tab to re-render in the chosen language after new messages have been loaded. To get this to work as desired, I\'ve had to fire the prefernceEditorLoader\'s "onLazyLoad" event when the language is selected. I\'m wondering whether this is in line with the "philosophy" of lazy load
2018-08-17T15:39:27 <gmoss> https://github.com/BlueSlug/infusion/commit/77cb7eea1cc5d91748a4d53c701736c97e45fdf3
2018-08-17T15:40:19 <gmoss> I realize now that I should think of a way that only ends up firing onLazyLoad once, rather than every time the language is selected

2018-08-17T18:29:01 <sgithens> cindyli: When you run the preferences server tests, the prefssafes should be cleared out between each run and only have the entries from `gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/data/prefsSafes.json` right ? For some reason I\'m seeing prefsSafe-1 thru 7, and then all the testdata ones (alice, davey, etc etc etc)
2018-08-17T18:30:54 <sgithens> I\'m writing a test for a listing endpoint I\'ve added for GPII-2966, and the list returned as the test ones,  plus all the others from testdata. I\'m working off the pii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTestsUtils.js like your original tests do
2018-08-17T18:36:28 <cindyli> sgithens: the pouchTestCaseHolder used for the preferences server tests uses a base grade "gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder" (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTestsUtils.js#L47), which loads data from testData/ too - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/PouchTestCaseHolder.js#L45-L52
2018-08-17T18:36:43 <sgithens> aha!
2018-08-17T18:36:50 <sgithens> cindyli: COol, thanks for the reference
2018-08-17T18:38:43 <cindyli> sgithens: I believe i was expecting "data" array from "gpii.tests.preferencesServer.pouchTestCaseHolder" should override the same option from its base grade - "gpii.tests.preferencesServer.pouchTestCaseHolder" as "views.json" was specified in preferencesServer test case holder, but seems i was wrong and arrays are merged
2018-08-17T18:38:57 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTestsUtils.js#L51
2018-08-17T18:39:29 <sgithens> cindyli: What would you expect the correct behavior to be? Probably to only load the 7 test ones we specify?
2018-08-17T18:39:37 <sgithens> Should we fix that?
2018-08-17T18:39:47 <cindyli> would be nice to fix it
2018-08-17T18:40:00 <sgithens> I might take a look at it today while I\'m working on the tests
2018-08-17T18:40:59 <cindyli> sgithens: before the fix, i think it\'s better to make sure preferences server tests don\'t use data from testData/preferences in case what i recalled is wrong ;)
2018-08-17T18:41:19 <sgithens> I don\'t think any of them do from reading through your stuff
2018-08-17T18:41:29 <cindyli> cool
2018-08-17T18:41:32 <sgithens> let me take another quick browse
2018-08-17T18:44:52 <sgithens> cindyli: all your prefsserver tests are confined to the 7 test prefssafes
2018-08-17T18:44:59 <sgithens> although I just forgot about the browser tests
2018-08-17T18:45:16 <cindyli> haha. thanks for checking, sgithens
2018-08-17T18:45:44 <sgithens> it looks like that is all defined inline
2018-08-17T18:46:09 <sgithens> I\'m goign to try and make the change, which will fix my test that depends on their being 7 of them to list them
2018-08-17T18:46:25 <cindyli> nice. thanks, sgithens
