2018-04-12T19:12:16 <Bosmon> Which is bound via an options distribution at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L76

2018-04-12T19:19:24 * alanharnum has quit
2018-04-12T19:21:11 <Bosmon> This is where Kasper implemented the front-end filtering that removes preferences that don\'t correspond to settings before sending from the Cloud: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L165
2018-04-12T19:21:36 <Bosmon> You may well have to do something similar to the inverse of this when you implement your extra workflow in the LifecycleManager that converts LifecycleInstructions back to preferences

2018-04-12T19:23:49 <Bosmon> Since the PCP channel already has a payload which looks very similar to preferences at this point: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L103
2018-04-12T19:24:20 * kasparnet has quit
2018-04-12T19:24:59 <Bosmon> We already have this event exposed by the LifecycleManager: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L69
2018-04-12T19:25:07 <Bosmon> We have an "onSessionSnapshotUpdate" event
2018-04-12T19:25:21 <Bosmon> But currently this is only listened to by the Journaller
2018-04-12T19:26:22 <Bosmon> cindyli - it is fired here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L39
2018-04-12T19:27:14 <Bosmon> But this event is listening to the wrong part of the model

2018-04-12T11:32:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume @Bosmon is arranging the call again?

2018-04-12T11:39:36 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: while we\'re waiting, i have a question about the code coverage reports. I ran the tests for my work on the self voicing work, but the results don\'t seem to be as I expect, or I\'m reading them wrong
2018-04-12T11:40:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Happy to look at it.
2018-04-12T11:40:33 <Justin_o> thanks, what\'s the best way for me to share that with you?
2018-04-12T11:40:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there already a branch/pull?
2018-04-12T11:41:07 <the-t-in-rtf> You could also copy the reports directory to your GitHub Pages instance if you have one.
2018-04-12T11:42:00 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: branch is https://github.com/jobara/infusion/tree/FLUID-6175
2018-04-12T11:42:07 <Justin_o> i don\'t have a github pages instance up sorrry
2018-04-12T11:42:29 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I\'ll have to run the report then, but at least with infusion that\'s fairly straightforward.
2018-04-12T11:42:33 <Justin_o> specifically I\'m intersted in the Orator component
2018-04-12T11:43:02 <Justin_o> textToSpeech is also low, but that may be because of the mocking I\'ve done.. i might need to use sinon or something else to test that instead
2018-04-12T11:43:29 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf, Justin_o, sgithens: I can organize the call if you\'d like.
2018-04-12T11:44:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that would be good.
2018-04-12T11:44:12 <Justin_o> georgitodorov: thanks, i\'m fine with whatever.
2018-04-12T11:44:14 <sgithens> sgithens: good morning!  Sorry missed the previous messages up there
2018-04-12T11:44:52 <sgithens> yes, please start the call :)
2018-04-12T11:46:02 <Bosmon> Hi there sorry to be late
2018-04-12T11:46:09 <Bosmon> pls start
2018-04-12T11:46:36 <georgitodorov> in a second
2018-04-12T11:48:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way I pinged you on a PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/892 for code review. However, for the next piece of work I\'m doing for FLUID-6175 I\'m moving most of that up to a component in the components directory. Would you prefer to just review that all at once in a new  PR once FLUID-6175 is done?

2018-04-12T13:36:14 <Bosmon> It would be great if either of you had time to take a look some time

2018-04-12T14:04:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for your code review. I think the changes are of enough significance that they\'ll be difficult for me to merge back upstream with the changes i\'m making for FLUID-6175. So rather I think I\'ll make the changes directly in FLUID-6175 and close off this PR. Does that seem okay?

2018-04-12T14:43:26 <Justin_o> i like that it also mentions alternative approaches
2018-04-12T14:48:33 <clown> Right:  the idea of *adding* a cue when something is removed ("user fred has disconnected") is good.  But, only doing that when its\'  (ahem) relevant.

2018-04-12T18:57:46 <Justin_o> However, I\'m having trouble of thinking of a purely iterative approach. I was thinking of using something like querySelectorAll or jQuery\'s find to get all of the descendants. However, it returns them in the order the elements are encountered.
2018-04-12T18:57:51 <Justin_o> so a structure like
2018-04-12T18:58:01 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XwSAqo5H/
2018-04-12T18:58:09 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-04-12T18:58:15 <Justin_o> would return the <em> before the <strong>
2018-04-12T18:58:38 <Justin_o> but in this case the text of the strong is actually first

2018-04-12T18:59:48 * colinclark has quit
2018-04-12T19:00:25 <Justin_o> we do know that the <em> has a <strong> as the first child, but i can imagine that jumping around in the array to attempt to pull out the text in the correct order will be rather complex
