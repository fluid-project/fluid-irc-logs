b'2018-05-31T15:36:49 <javjarfer> oh, then the fork is the most viable thing xD
2018-05-31T15:37:09 <mrtyler> hello, reading log
2018-05-31T15:37:19 <stegru> all doit is used for is invoking node in the desktop, rather than hidden in another one
2018-05-31T15:37:29 <stegru> is that correct, amatas[m] ?
2018-05-31T15:37:44 <stegru> you\'re not using it for remote execution, since that\'s what winrm is for
2018-05-31T15:38:33 <amatas[m]> right stegru
2018-05-31T15:38:51 * michelled joined the channel
2018-05-31T15:39:22 <stegru> it just so happens that I have code that can do that
2018-05-31T15:39:58 <amatas[m]> if I remember well, we included doit for running the test process in the same desktop session using always the same environment
2018-05-31T15:40:31 <stegru> psexec does that same, but it doesn\'t send stdout
2018-05-31T15:40:55 <amatas[m]> you can run any command without doit
2018-05-31T15:41:00 <mrtyler> javjarfer: i don\'t really know anything about doit or the windows ci process, so not sure i\'m the best person to advise here
2018-05-31T15:41:25 <mrtyler> i am in favor of not using a 7 year old piece of abandonware, and i would be surprised if there\'s not a different tool that could be used instead
2018-05-31T15:41:50 <mrtyler> however, a one-line patch and a custom build may be cheaper than replacing doit at this time. if so, that seems like a reasonable solution
2018-05-31T15:41:51 <stegru> mrtyler: you just described most of npm packages that are used ;)
2018-05-31T15:42:07 <amatas[m]> but be aware of that every time that you invoke a winrm command it creates a new session
2018-05-31T15:42:08 <javjarfer> mrtyler, okay, that it looks that we all agree that we should do something with doit
2018-05-31T15:42:37 <mrtyler> stegru: i am in favor of not using 7 year old abandonware whether it is a windows executable or an npm module, hth :)
2018-05-31T15:43:25 <stegru> perhaps it\'s not abandoned, but so perfect it hasn\'t had a bug in 7 years
2018-05-31T15:43:41 <javjarfer> hahaha well, then we need more packages like that
2018-05-31T15:44:18 <javjarfer> but it\'s also so perfect that people doesn\'t even give stars to it, because it\'s confirming a well known fact
2018-05-31T15:44:31 <mrtyler> if we reimplement all of gpii in TeX, we can probably get donald knuth to endorse us ;)
2018-05-31T15:44:42 <mrtyler> (TeX is the only software i know that\'s been "done" for >7 years)
2018-05-31T15:47:15 <javjarfer> xDDD TeX... I must confess I have always used LaTeX and never "needed" TeXC
2018-05-31T15:47:20 <javjarfer> TeX*
2018-05-31T15:47:40 <avtar> hi all, just saw the chat here
2018-05-31T15:48:06 <avtar> i think the github repo you\'re looking at is an unofficial clone
2018-05-31T15:48:06 <stegru> I have nothing against wearing latex
2018-05-31T15:48:12 <avtar> the project repo lives here https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/doit.git
2018-05-31T15:48:50 <avtar> last commit was 6 months ago
2018-05-31T15:54:12 <javjarfer> avtar, that are much better news
2018-05-31T15:55:57 <avtar> :)
2018-05-31T16:01:59 <mrtyler> oh boy it\'s gitweb!
2018-05-31T16:02:08 <mrtyler> simon tatham... isn\'t that the PuTTY guy?
2018-05-31T16:02:33 <javjarfer> I\'m going to report this to the repo that avtar has pasted
2018-05-31T16:02:34 <mrtyler> i wonder why he doesn\'t like github?
2018-05-31T16:02:47 <javjarfer> mrtyler, it is! I have just checked it
2018-05-31T16:04:02 <javjarfer> so, Bosmon, stegru, amatas[m], custom build while they answer? Or we left this open until know what they think about this?
2018-05-31T16:04:21 <Bosmon> javjarfer - custom build I think, since this issue is urgent
2018-05-31T16:04:23 <stegru> well, we can\'t wait
2018-05-31T16:04:27 <Bosmon> We can\'t trust any CI run until this problem is resolved
2018-05-31T16:04:42 <javjarfer> okay, then a fork is the way to go
2018-05-31T16:04:59 <javjarfer> GPII-DoIt?
2018-05-31T16:05:29 <Bosmon> Sure
2018-05-31T16:05:37 <Bosmon> or gpii-doit if it needs to go into npm
2018-05-31T16:06:35 <stegru> I might have a simpler solution... just create a small application that does the small feature we use doit for
2018-05-31T16:06:45 <javjarfer> Nice, I can\'t create repository for it in GPII in Github
2018-05-31T16:06:51 <javjarfer> if anyone have the permissions
2018-05-31T16:07:06 <javjarfer> stegru, well, if we can use it like doit
2018-05-31T16:08:21 <stegru> we\'ll see
2018-05-31T16:08:45 * alanharnum has quit

2018-05-31T16:16:24 <javjarfer> I can\'t too, I don\'t have permissions
2018-05-31T16:17:05 <jhernandez_> javjarfer:  stegru what do you want/need?
2018-05-31T16:17:16 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-05-31T16:17:22 <stegru> your body and soul
2018-05-31T16:17:39 <mrtyler> you\'re gonna need to contribute more to his mortgage imo
2018-05-31T16:17:48 <stegru> i already do
2018-05-31T16:18:03 <mrtyler> wow the EU is weird
2018-05-31T16:18:16 <stegru> Bosmon javjarfer: fancy skipping the windows meeting?
2018-05-31T16:19:51 <Bosmon> Yes I fancy skipping it
2018-05-31T16:19:55 <jhernandez_> stegru: I\'m fine - heading the airport soon, mom is coming :)
2018-05-31T16:19:59 <Bosmon> You\'ve done enough damage on windows for today :)
2018-05-31T16:20:30 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: +1
2018-05-31T16:20:59 <javjarfer> Bosmon, stegru haha well, for me it\'s okay to skip it, we know everything it\'s being done in windows this days so...
2018-05-31T16:21:27 <stegru> good, i\'ll eat my tea
2018-05-31T16:21:36 <jhernandez_> so, I had in mind sharing my experience with windows 1803 update
2018-05-31T16:21:40 <stegru> "dinner", for javi
2018-05-31T16:21:49 <javjarfer> jhernandez_, create a repo in GPII organization for the tool maybe
2018-05-31T16:21:49 <stegru> no thanks, jhernandez_
2018-05-31T16:21:54 <javjarfer> but don\'t know how to call it
2018-05-31T16:22:28 <stegru> javjarfer, just get it fixed and compiled, then we\'ll worry about putting the code somewhere
2018-05-31T16:22:41 <jhernandez_> but I guess that we can wait for the next MS "Tuesday\'s patch"
2018-05-31T16:22:44 <javjarfer> stegru, fair enough
2018-05-31T16:23:00 <javjarfer> doing it
2018-05-31T16:23:20 <stegru> doit ;)
2018-05-31T16:23:26 <jhernandez_> doit.ps1
2018-05-31T16:26:55 <stegru> javjarfer: perhaps also clone my crashing PR, add the new doitclient to it, and put something in the provisioning script to copy it to c:\\windows
2018-05-31T16:27:17 <stegru> just as a way to slip it in to the VM to test it
2018-05-31T16:27:22 <javjarfer> yes, it\'s a great start
2018-05-31T16:29:39 <stegru> we\'ll know it\'s a success if it fails ;)

2018-05-31T17:51:36 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2018-05-31T17:51:48 <cindyli> i will have a pull request for you soon
2018-05-31T17:52:17 <Bosmon> That\'s great
2018-05-31T17:52:23 <Bosmon> for reusing the preferences files?
2018-05-31T17:52:32 <Bosmon> Sorry about my other filings
2018-05-31T17:52:39 <Bosmon> I got quite confused while you were away : P
2018-05-31T17:52:40 <cindyli> here it is - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/615
2018-05-31T17:53:06 <cindyli> sorry about my confusing readme. improved in this pull request. let me know
2018-05-31T17:53:12 <Bosmon> That\'s fine
2018-05-31T17:53:29 <Bosmon> I know that in theory I reviewed this code, but somehow forgot many of the things you told me : P
2018-05-31T17:53:30 <cindyli> it might still not clear enough.
2018-05-31T17:53:40 <Bosmon> On the other hand, if it wasn\'t clear enough to me, it probably won\'t be clear to others either
2018-05-31T17:53:47 <cindyli> agreed
2018-05-31T17:54:16 <Bosmon> Would you be able to review my "User Errors" pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/609 ?
2018-05-31T17:54:39 <cindyli> sure
2018-05-31T17:54:49 <Bosmon> Great, thanks
2018-05-31T17:55:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you merge in the master into this pull request
2018-05-31T17:55:43 <cindyli> there are some conflicts
2018-05-31T17:55:50 <Bosmon> yes
2018-05-31T17:59:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s merged up

2018-05-31T20:07:45 * clown looks
2018-05-31T20:08:08 <gtirloni> clown: newer f28 box with updated gnome-shell and packagekit
2018-05-31T20:08:57 <clown> gtirloni:  I think this has to do with the JIRA I created earlier today, and pull request.
2018-05-31T20:09:14 <clown> Namely, packagkit service is being masked in the box.
2018-05-31T20:09:25 <clown> but, it needs to be running in gpii-linux.
2018-05-31T20:10:10 <gtirloni> weird, i thought we had re-enabled it in gpii-linux only
2018-05-31T20:10:25 <gtirloni> when we had the out of memory incident and disabled PK in the box
2018-05-31T20:10:57 <clown> gtirloni:  If you did, I couldn\'t find it.  So I added a script to the Vagrantfile (for gpii-linux)
2018-05-31T20:11:02 <gtirloni> hmm my memory is blurry on that one though, maybe i forgot to actually do that
2018-05-31T20:11:08 <clown> I see you fired up my PR changes\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-05-31T20:11:11 <clown> just now.
2018-05-31T20:11:42 <gtirloni> yep, just to get a new build
2018-05-31T20:12:01 <gtirloni> ok, i\'d bet i forgot to actually do that, thanks for spotting this! PK definitely needs to be enabled for gpii-linux
2018-05-31T20:12:22 <clown> But yes, I remember talking about your re-enabling it just for linux, but I don\'t remember how you did it.  Was that month ago or so?
2018-05-31T20:12:51 <gtirloni> yeah, i think so.. when i broke it, ha
2018-05-31T20:13:13 <gtirloni> that PR looks good to me, thanks for submitting it
2018-05-31T20:13:46 <clown> you\'re welcome (and thanks for the +1)
2018-05-31T20:15:05 <clown> gtirloni, here is where I believe packagkit is disabled, for fedora:  https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-fedora/blob/master/scripts/INFRA-150.sh#L4
2018-05-31T20:15:46 <clown> but, that is for *all* the uses of a fedora box \xe2\x80\x94 universal, infusion, linux, (anyone else?)
2018-05-31T20:16:04 <clown> and, it\'s fine for universal and infusion.  but not for linux
2018-05-31T20:16:10 <gtirloni> yep, that\'s it
2018-05-31T20:17:52 <clown> gtirloni:  I\'m not sure if there is a gpii that uses the CentOS box.  If so, it would need a similar fix.

2018-05-31T09:31:37 <Bosmon> stegru - is it as simple as that?
2018-05-31T09:33:22 <stegru> I don\'t know yet, Bosmon.. I got and idle gpii-windows to crash by changing the high-contrast repeatedly, from outside GPII
2018-05-31T09:33:51 <stegru> and that code only gets invoked if not running under electron
2018-05-31T09:34:27 <Bosmon> stegru - pretty interesting
2018-05-31T09:34:31 <Bosmon> Why is it not invoked under electron?
2018-05-31T09:35:08 <Bosmon> Ah I see
2018-05-31T09:35:13 <Bosmon> It has its own message loop
2018-05-31T09:35:15 <Bosmon> v.v.interesting
2018-05-31T09:35:22 <stegru> yes, electron provides one
2018-05-31T09:35:59 <stegru> it\'s not a very good one, but better than nothing - it\'s only needed for the USB and metrics
2018-05-31T09:37:28 <stegru> but, when I fixed it yesterday the tests still crashed
2018-05-31T09:37:28 <Bosmon> OK, so you wrote this in December and it got merged as "in-process user listeners" in March
2018-05-31T09:37:33 <Bosmon> Fits the timelines fairly well
2018-05-31T09:37:57 <stegru> yeh
2018-05-31T09:39:37 <javjarfer[m]> For whatever reason, I\'m missing Bosmon  messages here, sorry if I didn\'t answer you to something Bosmon, I realized just now asking to stegru
2018-05-31T09:41:22 * javjarfer joined the channel
2018-05-31T09:42:40 <javjarfer> It looks like timelines match really well, but doesn\'t explain yet while tests still crashed yesterday for stegru
2018-05-31T09:42:52 <Bosmon> Shame
2018-05-31T09:42:59 <Bosmon> Seems like a really plausible cause
2018-05-31T09:44:24 <stegru> i think there\'s another bug, too
2018-05-31T09:44:34 <Bosmon> ok
2018-05-31T09:44:41 <javjarfer> Bosmon, haha shame
2018-05-31T09:44:48 <Bosmon> Any signs that your fix at least reduces the frequency of the problem?
2018-05-31T09:44:51 <javjarfer> stegru, do you think it could be in the same code?
2018-05-31T09:44:54 <stegru> this definitely causes a crash: https://gist.github.com/stegru/1e109fd2c41556d77e3ec75db77ea43c
2018-05-31T09:44:59 <stegru> maybe
2018-05-31T09:45:46 <javjarfer> waiting that process causes a crash?
2018-05-31T09:46:08 <javjarfer> the dangling process we were talking yesterday?
2018-05-31T09:46:10 <stegru> it repeatedly sets the high-contrast on and off
2018-05-31T09:46:20 <javjarfer> ooh
2018-05-31T09:46:30 <stegru> it\'s the same process, but unrelated to what we\'re doing
2018-05-31T09:46:31 <javjarfer> okay, it keeps causing a crash in the system doing that
2018-05-31T09:46:44 <stegru> I bet if I made something that just sends windows messages, it would also cause the crash
2018-05-31T09:46:48 <javjarfer> yes yes, true
2018-05-31T09:49:35 <Bosmon> Still, this sounds like great progress
2018-05-31T09:51:39 <javjarfer> Bosmon, I was hallucinated when stegru said to me this morning, looks like we are closer
2018-05-31T10:06:59 <stegru> 1 in 31 crashes so far
2018-05-31T10:07:43 <javjarfer> great, was the first execution?

2018-05-31T13:23:57 <javjarfer> Bosmon, yeah... finally. We have a file with 65 clean acceptanceTests executions, and also hundreds of times of stegru personal test sending windows messages with the "HighContrast" feature
2018-05-31T13:24:02 <javjarfer> 0 issues
2018-05-31T13:24:10 <Bosmon> Superb
2018-05-31T13:24:14 <Bosmon> It was the Buffer issue?
2018-05-31T13:24:25 <javjarfer> I was indeed
2018-05-31T13:24:54 <stegru> writing to a reference to a buffer, instead of the actual buffer
2018-05-31T13:24:55 <javjarfer> Buffer issue due to extra referencing + memory not zeroed due to the old Buffer node API
2018-05-31T13:26:08 <javjarfer> Yes stegru thought it could be two differents bugs, and indeed we had then, because the buffer wasn\'t zeroed, so maybe sometimes the memory zone was secure, but further calls to following methods using the not zeroed struct lead to another kind of crash
2018-05-31T13:34:01 <javjarfer> Bosmon, I\'m going to write the JIRA for the return code when segfault, I need to go back to previous opens pulls I have
2018-05-31T13:34:20 <javjarfer> I\'m going to finish that small one I have for the retrying and then go back to internationalization
2018-05-31T13:34:32 <Bosmon> javjarfer - so we do get exit code 0?
2018-05-31T13:34:34 <Bosmon> Or what
2018-05-31T13:34:41 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-31T13:34:52 <javjarfer> Bosmon, don\'t know yet
2018-05-31T13:35:32 <javjarfer> I was going to spend some time into it after updating the others pulls, should I put it in the top of the list?
2018-05-31T13:36:30 <javjarfer> also, I think we should have something like mock tests for our native API, just for having a strong test in the endpoints that have probe to be so sensible and difficult to debug
2018-05-31T13:36:58 <javjarfer> What are the feelings about that?
2018-05-31T13:37:22 <Bosmon> javjarfer - I think incorrect exit code checking has to be treated as urgent, yes
2018-05-31T13:37:30 <Bosmon> It invalidates the use of CI on all other work
2018-05-31T13:37:39 <javjarfer> Bosmon, Okay, doing it right now then
2018-05-31T13:38:10 <Bosmon> Awesome javjarfer, thanks so much!

2018-05-31T14:25:15 <stegru> jhernandez_: I\'m wondering if there\'s any purpose in having the installer for gpii-windows?

2018-05-31T14:34:19 <jhernandez_> stegru: hey
2018-05-31T14:34:30 <stegru> hola
2018-05-31T14:36:24 <jhernandez_> well, when we started delivering the gpii-app installer I started to think that the windows one was not going to be required anymore
2018-05-31T14:36:41 <javjarfer> Bosmon, stegru has furiously overtake me by the right (English style) on the research for the crash exit code, so I have put him as assignee in the JIRA issue GPII-3091
2018-05-31T14:36:52 <jhernandez_> if you\'re proposing to get rid of it, you have a +1 from my side
2018-05-31T14:37:32 <stegru> jhernandez_: it just makes CI take forever and a day
2018-05-31T14:37:38 <stegru> javjarfer: why can\'t you do it?
2018-05-31T14:37:51 <jhernandez_> stegru: totally agree
2018-05-31T14:39:26 <javjarfer> jhernandez_, stegru yes, +1 here, I don\'t see the need of having it in CI
2018-05-31T14:40:14 <javjarfer> stegru, I think you meant jhernandez_
2018-05-31T14:40:23 <stegru> i meant you
2018-05-31T14:40:36 <stegru> consider it removed: GPII-3092
2018-05-31T14:41:28 <javjarfer> So you meant the researh for the crash exit code
2018-05-31T14:41:31 <javjarfer> ??
2018-05-31T14:42:01 <javjarfer> Because you already had a PR researching the issue, if you want I can continue from that point, or I can assist
2018-05-31T14:42:07 <javjarfer> whatever you prefer
2018-05-31T14:43:12 <javjarfer> well, your PR have now an answer "doitclient.exe : doit: remote error: GetExitCodeProcess failed"
2018-05-31T14:43:22 <javjarfer> crash but no results of error in CI
2018-05-31T14:44:22 <javjarfer> If the process segfaults doIt doesn\'t return a proper error code
2018-05-31T14:44:48 <javjarfer> and we don\'t consider doit not being able to return an error code, a error code xD
2018-05-31T14:50:48 <Bosmon> I\'ve forgotten what the "doitclient.exe" does
2018-05-31T14:51:11 <Bosmon> Yes, certainly axe the plain windows installer
2018-05-31T14:54:20 <stegru> it starts gpii in the context of the user session, rather than that of the "vagrant winrm" command
2018-05-31T14:54:27 <javjarfer[m]> just execute the command remotely
2018-05-31T14:54:37 * jessm joined the channel
2018-05-31T14:54:38 <stegru> doitclient isn\'t returning the error code
2018-05-31T14:54:47 <javjarfer> well, that\'s more acurrate than my description
2018-05-31T14:55:31 <stegru> I think we need the assistance of amatas[m]
2018-05-31T14:58:18 <amatas[m]> hi!
2018-05-31T15:00:30 <javjarfer> hi! amatas[m]
2018-05-31T15:00:35 <stegru> amatas[m]: sorry, didn\'t mean to ping you yet, but the doitclient.exe command in do.ps1 isn\'t returning the exit code of node
2018-05-31T15:00:53 <javjarfer> we are just wondering about how to do that
2018-05-31T15:01:11 <javjarfer> I see in the client code here https://github.com/russelldavis/DoIt/blob/master/doitclient.c
2018-05-31T15:01:32 <javjarfer> that it has this paramater " wcmd <command>     start Windows CLI process and return output" is the one we are using?
2018-05-31T15:02:02 <stegru> ok, so "start" isn\'t returning the exit code?
2018-05-31T15:02:41 <stegru> nevermind, talking nonsense
2018-05-31T15:04:16 <javjarfer> stegru, where is the do.ps1 script located?
2018-05-31T15:04:28 <stegru> c:\\windows\\

2018-05-31T15:07:42 <javjarfer> thanks amatas[m]
2018-05-31T15:08:01 <javjarfer> I think we might be running into some issue due to $lastExitCode

2018-05-31T15:10:51 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-31T15:11:08 <stegru> it\'s this: https://github.com/russelldavis/DoIt/blob/master/doit.c#L263, then https://github.com/russelldavis/DoIt/blob/master/doit.c#L537
2018-05-31T15:11:08 <javjarfer> mybad... I was thinking in another situation... $lastExitCode seems fine there
2018-05-31T15:11:59 <javjarfer> oh, okay, then we should have a -1
2018-05-31T15:12:02 <javjarfer> as the return code
2018-05-31T15:12:10 <javjarfer> -1 should be error
2018-05-31T15:15:37 <stegru> no, that\'s on the server code.. the client side just prints out that error and returns 0
2018-05-31T15:15:43 <stegru> https://github.com/russelldavis/DoIt/blob/master/doitclient.c#L1232
2018-05-31T15:16:18 <javjarfer> oh... what...
2018-05-31T15:16:19 <javjarfer> https://github.com/russelldavis/DoIt/blob/master/doitclient.c#L1232
2018-05-31T15:16:31 <javjarfer> sorry, repasted, wanted to past other thing
2018-05-31T15:16:57 <javjarfer> why??? which is the point of returning a string if not able to return a error code?
2018-05-31T15:17:22 <javjarfer> Is this Exceptions reimplemented in C?
2018-05-31T15:18:20 <javjarfer> Should we have a fork of that project with that corrected? or should we report it as an issue?
2018-05-31T15:24:01 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-05-31T15:34:35 <javjarfer> What do you think amatas[m] , mrtyler, stegru, Bosmon, should we change the behavior of DoIt in place or submit a issue to the project?
2018-05-31T15:34:54 <Bosmon> javjarfer what do you mean by "in place"?
2018-05-31T15:35:12 <stegru> a custom build of doit?
2018-05-31T15:35:23 <javjarfer> Forking the project and changing the line that stegru has pointed
2018-05-31T15:35:25 <javjarfer> yes
2018-05-31T15:36:03 <stegru> what are the other options?
2018-05-31T15:36:15 <Bosmon> Well, do both obviously : P
2018-05-31T15:36:22 <amatas[m]> the project seems to be dead (last commit is from 7 years ago)
2018-05-31T15:36:29 <Bosmon> !
2018-05-31T15:36:36 <Bosmon> We adopted a dead project from 7 years ago?! : P
