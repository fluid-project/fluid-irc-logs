2018-06-01T09:56:25 <gtirloni> I\'m triggering some builds just to stress CI, please don\'t worry
2018-06-01T09:59:32 <gtirloni> someone is worrying but i can\'t tell who that is
2018-06-01T10:48:55 <stegru> amatas[m] or gtirloni: it looks like the "winrm" plugin isn\'t working on CI
2018-06-01T10:50:20 <amatas[m]> the winrm plugin was installed when the feature wasn\'t available in the previous versions of Vagrant
2018-06-01T10:50:33 <amatas[m]> Vagrant supports winrm natively
2018-06-01T10:52:38 <amatas[m]> so I guess that we can change the way that the CI invokes the commands inside the VM
2018-06-01T10:58:07 <stegru> well, I\'m getting this error from CI:
2018-06-01T10:58:09 <stegru> [windows-tests] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/jenkins7614893886395970249.sh
2018-06-01T10:58:09 <stegru> + vagrant winrm -c \'do.ps1 -c \'\\\'\'grunt lint\'\\\'\'\'
2018-06-01T10:58:09 <stegru> Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]
2018-06-01T11:07:21 <gtirloni> installed it and the `vagrant winrm` command now is available.. looks like the gpii-ops/ansible-gpii-ci-worker will need to install it
2018-06-01T11:07:30 <gtirloni> vagrant often corrupts the installed plugins when it\'s upgraded
2018-06-01T11:10:34 <gtirloni> amatas[m]: could the new command be `vagrant powershell -c`? i havent\' used it
2018-06-01T11:16:41 <amatas[m]> it could be, I haven\'t used yet as well
2018-06-01T11:33:57 <Bosmon> Looking a bit better
2018-06-01T11:34:06 <Bosmon> Seems that our "production config tests" are still failing
2018-06-01T11:34:14 <Bosmon> "docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for gpii/preferences-dataloader, repository does not exist or may require \'docker login\'.
2018-06-01T11:34:14 <Bosmon> See \'docker run --help\'."
2018-06-01T11:37:51 <Bosmon> OK, thanks gtirloni
