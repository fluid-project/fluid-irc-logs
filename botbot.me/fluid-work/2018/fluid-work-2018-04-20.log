2018-04-20T17:19:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - a regexp?
2018-04-20T17:20:02 <Bosmon> Given I imagine we can't actually do this within the database, this will end up as fast as anything else
2018-04-20T17:20:25 <Bosmon> But we may as well just allocate a flag within the document that encodes whether it has been loaded from code or not
2018-04-20T17:21:57 * kasparnet has quit
2018-04-20T17:23:28 <cindyli> this flag will be thrown away once PPT is in place?
2018-04-20T17:23:46 <cindyli> it seems regex can be used in couchdb view functions - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7991464/temporary-couchdb-view-of-documents-with-doc-id-matching-regular-expression
2018-04-20T17:24:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: what do you think to use regex to match _id values with xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
2018-04-20T17:25:06 <cindyli> for UUIDs

2018-04-20T17:26:44 <cindyli> nice
2018-04-20T17:35:51 <sgithens> will the flag be thrown away once editing tools are in place?

2018-04-20T18:54:20 <cindyli> btw, sgithens and Bosmon, don't forget to fill up the doodle I sent a few hours ago

2018-04-20T12:55:56 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: bonjour ANTVANIG
2018-04-20T12:56:29 <jhernandez_> I was updating windows/pull/166
2018-04-20T12:57:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: catching up on your reply about expanders from yesterday. In my case I\'m taking the implementation you have for fluid.newViewComponent and adding it as a grade to the fluid.orator.controller component. However, I want to change the way the container is added, so i override the expander. What I\'m seeing is that the original expander is still being called unless i comment it out. So either they are both running or
2018-04-20T12:57:14 <Justin_o> the overriding isn\'t happening.
2018-04-20T12:57:24 <jhernandez_> and I\'m not sure about verifying that test-window.exe gets build when we run npm install
2018-04-20T12:57:44 <alanharnum> michelled: 10:00?
2018-04-20T12:58:26 <jhernandez_> where/how is this supposed to be made? I don\'t see any reference at all to that in the most recent version of windows
2018-04-20T12:58:35 <michelled> perfect alanharnum
2018-04-20T13:00:02 <jhernandez_> I\'d say that we need to add a postinstall script to perform such thing
2018-04-20T13:03:37 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-04-20T13:04:21 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - well you recall that this is built by the provisioning scripts which were written by gloob
2018-04-20T13:04:33 <jhernandez_> right
2018-04-20T13:04:38 <Bosmon> Yes, moving them to a postinstall script seems good
2018-04-20T13:04:53 <Bosmon> SInce otherwise we have an "npm install" that results in a test failure - which is what we have right now
2018-04-20T13:05:16 <jhernandez_> sure, will do that
2018-04-20T13:05:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you show me how you overrode the expander?
2018-04-20T13:05:21 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - awesome!
2018-04-20T13:06:20 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: in that case, I will remove that step from Build.ps1, since it\'s no longer needed
2018-04-20T13:10:12 <cindyli> Bosmon: is next Thursday 2pm EDT good for you to have our next meeting?
2018-04-20T13:11:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - unfortunately that time is bad
2018-04-20T13:11:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: ok, i will send a doodle to collect ppl\'s availabilities
2018-04-20T13:14:00 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-04-20T13:14:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it looks like this
2018-04-20T13:14:41 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CZntRnpm/
2018-04-20T13:22:03 <Bosmon> Oh right, yes
2018-04-20T13:22:05 <Bosmon> It\'s in "members"
2018-04-20T13:22:27 <Bosmon> Those are buggered
2018-04-20T13:22:28 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5668
2018-04-20T13:23:08 <Bosmon> You could get around the problem by writing the overridden definition in a plain "option" and then referring to it at the last moment from "members"
2018-04-20T13:23:11 <Bosmon> But it\'s not really worth it
2018-04-20T13:23:22 <Bosmon> It\'s best just for now to ensure that the wrong definition is never written
2018-04-20T13:23:47 <Bosmon> This is a tough issue in the framework and probably won\'t be addressed until about 2 rewrites from now
2018-04-20T13:27:31 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-04-20T13:27:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - is that student who worked on the "revert package-lock.json" issue actually enrolled or will we never see them again?
2018-04-20T13:28:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: GSoC results haven\'t been announced yet, so I can\'t answer that till Monday or Tuesday of next week.
2018-04-20T13:28:46 <Bosmon> ok

2018-04-20T13:31:08 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - could I add a general request for people not to clean up their remote branches when they are done with work
2018-04-20T13:31:13 <Bosmon> I know that this is what other communities recommend
2018-04-20T13:31:19 <Bosmon> But it can make JIRA reports very hard to read
2018-04-20T13:31:52 <Bosmon> For example here is a report from cindyli - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5614?focusedCommentId=29128&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-29128
2018-04-20T13:32:00 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2018-04-20T13:32:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s interesting.. i tend to clean mine up mostly because it makes a mess of my branch list and it\'s hard to know what i still have on the go
2018-04-20T13:32:25 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-04-20T13:32:26 <Bosmon> Unfortunately the link to the options distribution is now broken and will probably never be recoverable
2018-04-20T13:32:39 <stegru> it pays to be lazy
2018-04-20T13:32:43 <cindyli> makes sense. need to change my habbit ;)
2018-04-20T13:32:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess it\'s fine to clean up branches in your local repo but it would be great to leave them in the remote
2018-04-20T13:33:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess to your point is it only an issue for branches that haven\'t been merged?
2018-04-20T13:33:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think it is an issue for all time
2018-04-20T13:33:32 <Bosmon> This issue report is meant to stand by itself, for anyone who would ever read it
2018-04-20T13:33:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but that history would be in the master branch even if the corresponding branch it was merged from was removed
2018-04-20T13:34:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the history is there, but the branch label name is gone
2018-04-20T13:34:18 <Bosmon> Which is why the link is broken
2018-04-20T13:34:34 <Bosmon> This link expects there to be a remote branch called "GPII-1521-distributeOptions"
2018-04-20T13:34:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that\'s true.. i guess just mean it would be a hassle but it would be recoverable
2018-04-20T13:34:48 <Bosmon> Certainly the COMMIT exists that was once referenced by this link
2018-04-20T13:35:13 <Bosmon> but without the branch label it will be extremely difficult to know which commit this is
2018-04-20T13:35:25 <Bosmon> And as you say, if the branch was never merged the content is indeed gone forever
2018-04-20T13:35:34 <Bosmon> "probably"
2018-04-20T13:36:10 <Bosmon> Remember that the recommendations of other communities are designed for populations of goldfish
2018-04-20T13:36:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess this particular one was never merged, but otherwise i think you should be able to search for the merge commit to find it
2018-04-20T13:37:03 <Bosmon> That if work is more than a couple of years old or is "done" can never be of relevance to anyone else
2018-04-20T13:37:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, but it would be much better if the link just worked :)
2018-04-20T13:42:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hard to argue with that ;) but it\'s still an issue for prior branches and could happen again in the future.... anyways here\'s an example search for merged PRs in this case for FLUID-4978 which i just picked randomly. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/search?utf8=\xe2\x9c\x93&q=%22FLUID-4978%22+merge%3Atrue&type=Commits
2018-04-20T13:43:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - note that this also depends on people writing commit comments correctly
2018-04-20T13:43:33 <Bosmon> Since the actual *name* of the branch is gone forever
2018-04-20T13:43:47 <Bosmon> All this search does is search for the appearance of the text in a commit comment
2018-04-20T13:44:07 <Justin_o> well if the branch was named correctly, it would be okay because the branch name is at the top of the merge commit
2018-04-20T13:44:09 <Bosmon> So what if, as is very likely, cindyli never wrote the text "GPII-1521-distributeOptions" in a commit comment?
2018-04-20T13:45:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so this only searches for merged code first off, so in the case of the one you mentioned at the start you wouldn\'t ever be able to find it.. so this is really just for cases where the branch was merged but not preserved and you need to find it.
2018-04-20T13:46:16 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-04-20T13:46:19 <Justin_o> so to answer your last question, if the branch name or commit message were named appropriately it will find it.. and with the original URL containing the branch name it should be locatable via the search
2018-04-20T13:46:33 <Bosmon> Well it also depends that the person merged the branch correctly
2018-04-20T13:46:38 <Bosmon> That is, with the "-no-ff" option
2018-04-20T13:47:28 <Bosmon> But anyway yes, the values behind this process are very similar to the ones behind recovering deleted files :)
2018-04-20T13:47:38 <Justin_o> however, i guess the edge case would be that branch being merged into another branch for which the PR was filed, and the --log flag was either not used when merging or it was too long and got cut off, then yes, you wouldn\'t be able to find it.. and also the commits messages for the branch in question would have to not have been written correctly.
2018-04-20T13:47:41 <Bosmon> It "might well" be possible, assuming that a whole bunch of factors align
2018-04-20T13:50:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, this is for recovery

2018-04-20T14:49:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: yesterday at the meeting, we talked about when loading snapsets into CouchDB, "_id" values of gpii keys should be "gpiiKey-{filename}" so we know what old snapsets to delete at reloading. but because "_id" values are also the keys that are used to key in/out, this means for example with "snapset-1a", the key written on the physical token should be "gpiiKey-snapset-1a" instead of "snapset-1a". also if someone uses GET /user/:g
2018-04-20T14:49:30 <cindyli> piiKey/login endpoint to key in, :gpiiKey here should be "gpiiKey-snapset-1a". is this problematic?
2018-04-20T14:51:53 <cindyli> i\'m thinking if we wanna continue to use the convention of "{filename}" as keys and the "_id" values, the other way we can use to remove old snapsets is to check the length of "_id" values
2018-04-20T14:52:11 <cindyli> UUIDs should be 36 characters or more
2018-04-20T14:52:32 <cindyli> none of our snapset file names are that long
2018-04-20T14:53:01 <cindyli> what do you think?
2018-04-20T14:54:51 <cindyli> the longest so far is 30 chars: uioPlus_unhandled_support_tool
