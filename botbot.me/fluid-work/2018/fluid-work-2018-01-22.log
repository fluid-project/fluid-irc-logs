b'2018-01-22T19:47:00 <javjarfer[m]> I assume that it\'s a complete different history there
2018-01-22T19:59:39 <stegru> oh yes, try 64:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
2018-01-22T20:01:52 <stegru> the registryResolver handles that, which calls readRegistryKey, then openRegistryKey, then that one
2018-01-22T20:02:03 <stegru> parseRegistryPath
2018-01-22T20:03:49 <stegru> oh, the "64:" is after the base key

2018-01-22T20:38:46 <gmoss> simonjb: do you have a moment to field a question about infusion events and namespacing?
2018-01-22T20:39:06 <gmoss> (or anyone else who\'d like to :))
2018-01-22T20:39:26 <simonjb> sure gmoss
2018-01-22T20:42:16 <gmoss> simonjb: great! thanks. Let\'s say I have two listeners, A and B (defined in that order), set up on a component, both with the same event and namespace. The docs say that "the framework will make sure that only one listener will ever be attached to myEvent which mentions the same namespace". They also say that if one is displaced, it is added to a hidden stack of listeners that become active again if the displacing
2018-01-22T20:42:16 <gmoss> listener is somehow destroyed. My question is: between A and B, which would you expect to be displaced? follow-up questions include: what determines which event will be displaced? can you think of a case where A won\'t work unless B is defined? i.e. if I comment out B, A stops working
2018-01-22T20:42:29 <gmoss> I hope I haven\'t simplified things too much

2018-01-22T10:22:52 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon and anyone else interested, I am writing up rough notes before working on improvements to fluid.stringTemplate, which will help with i18n work.
2018-01-22T10:22:53 <the-t-in-rtf> See: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6223?focusedCommentId=38431&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-38431
2018-01-22T10:57:22 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon (or really, anyone).  I just pulled down Infusion master and am now getting multiple module resolution errors.
2018-01-22T10:58:41 <the-t-in-rtf> For example, this fails:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-testem/blob/GPII-2736/src/js/testem-component.js#L13
2018-01-22T11:00:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Never mind.
2018-01-22T11:00:25 <the-t-in-rtf> It appears my work on fluid.stringTemplate immediately broke that part of fluid.require.

2018-01-22T11:53:22 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru ! Are you here today?
2018-01-22T11:53:38 <stegru> hello! yes
2018-01-22T11:54:01 <javjarfer[m]> nice, do you have time for some discussion about our process api?
2018-01-22T11:55:13 <stegru> yes ok
2018-01-22T12:04:00 <javjarfer[m]> great, I have observed several inconsistencies again in the tests from Morpher and Simplification, and I think I have a several points to check out
2018-01-22T12:04:27 <javjarfer[m]> did you take a look here?

2018-01-22T12:27:47 <stegru> oh
2018-01-22T12:28:11 <stegru> yes, what about it?
2018-01-22T12:28:32 <stegru> i mean, what are you doing, and what are you seeing?
2018-01-22T12:28:38 <javjarfer[m]> I think I found a problem regarding that issue
2018-01-22T12:28:41 <stegru> ok
2018-01-22T12:29:10 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-01-22T12:29:33 <javjarfer[m]> Sometimes, when trying to kill the explorer, the only way 'processTermination' detection was working, is by using name instead of pid
2018-01-22T12:30:02 <stegru> yes, because there are multiple explorer pids?
2018-01-22T12:31:45 <javjarfer[m]> well, I made a function for waiting for 'all-pids'
2018-01-22T12:31:48 <stegru> ok
2018-01-22T12:32:08 <stegru> you could try and get the proper pid
2018-01-22T12:32:59 <javjarfer[m]> but when I was trying to use it, it always returned me false, it was like this line was always excepting https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/processHandling/processHandling.js#L129
2018-01-22T12:33:01 <javjarfer[m]> no matter the real state of the process
2018-01-22T12:33:51 <javjarfer[m]> but, when I made a function based on findProcessByName using the .net API, but receiving pids as parameter
2018-01-22T12:34:18 <javjarfer[m]> I can still reproduce the behavior and send you links to the state of files
2018-01-22T12:34:52 <stegru> if you want
2018-01-22T12:35:27 <javjarfer[m]> well, I think that will be better for knowing if we are into a real issue with that
2018-01-22T12:35:47 <stegru> yeh
2018-01-22T12:35:54 <javjarfer[m]> or you prefer me to use my working imp and update the pull?
2018-01-22T12:36:06 <stegru> whatever is easiest for you
2018-01-22T12:36:07 <javjarfer[m]> whatever you prefer, feel free xD
2018-01-22T12:36:26 <javjarfer[m]> well, let's trace this properly then
2018-01-22T12:36:43 <stegru> well, i wouldn't worry too much about isProcessRunning - the process reporter is the preferred method
2018-01-22T12:39:16 <javjarfer[m]> > well, i wouldn't worry too much about isProcessRunning - the process reporter is the preferred method
2018-01-22T12:39:17 <javjarfer[m]> that is true
2018-01-22T12:40:49 <javjarfer[m]> mmm maybe then in your rewrite of this using process reporter could be the good place for doing this
2018-01-22T12:41:38 <javjarfer[m]> yes, I will flag the things that presents issues, and how they presents it, and wait until we use the new proper method for processReporting, it's silly put more work into that
2018-01-22T12:41:46 <stegru> yeh
2018-01-22T12:42:28 <stegru> there's nothing stopping you from re-writing isProcessRunning to use the process reporter ;)
2018-01-22T12:44:34 <javjarfer[m]> > there's nothing stopping you from re-writing isProcessRunning to use the process reporter ;)
2018-01-22T12:44:35 <javjarfer[m]> haha true, I will open a subtask for that in the jira for GPII-2521 and do that
2018-01-22T12:44:52 <javjarfer[m]> would be better for when it need to reach master having that fixed

2018-01-22T19:17:04 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru , was simply a question from the meeting for the ATIA demo
2018-01-22T19:17:16 <stegru> ok
2018-01-22T19:17:47 <javjarfer[m]> just to know if was any progress with this: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/35
2018-01-22T19:19:01 <javjarfer[m]> by the way, did your pull to fix the access to the registry keys that were just available in the 64bit address space of the registry got to master?
2018-01-22T19:22:16 <stegru> yes I've been working on the tray icon today
2018-01-22T19:22:29 <stegru> yes, I think the 64bit registry is in master
2018-01-22T19:23:14 <javjarfer[m]> nice, to both things
2018-01-22T19:23:36 <javjarfer[m]> could you please paste your updates on the first one here? https://docs.google.com/document/d/144umM1J3R2FJaZP0_LV-RjTZXtlPfnbJIrcNCK5q_rM/edit
2018-01-22T19:23:51 <javjarfer[m]> point 3, sub-point c
2018-01-22T19:24:01 <javjarfer[m]> thanks for that,
2018-01-22T19:26:57 <stegru> done
2018-01-22T19:27:35 <stegru> there was a small problem with it, javjarfer[m].. sometimes it froze while the settings window was opening
2018-01-22T19:27:58 <stegru> also, I'm hiding the window too
2018-01-22T19:28:50 <javjarfer[m]> > there was a small problem with it, javjarfer[m].. sometimes it froze while the settings window was opening
2018-01-22T19:28:51 <javjarfer[m]> oh, how have you fix that?
2018-01-22T19:29:03 <javjarfer[m]> the windows simply froze?
2018-01-22T19:29:07 <javjarfer[m]> the window\x0f
2018-01-22T19:30:51 <stegru> the program froze.. at the first rootElement.FindFirst call
2018-01-22T19:31:34 <stegru> it only happened sometimes, and adding a Sleep(1000) before it fixed it
2018-01-22T19:31:40 <javjarfer[m]> ahhh okay
2018-01-22T19:31:46 <javjarfer[m]> I had that issue too
2018-01-22T19:31:59 <stegru> but i'm actually waiting for the window to be created now.. so i can get the hwnd and hide it
2018-01-22T19:32:07 <stegru> hide = move off the screen
2018-01-22T19:32:50 <javjarfer[m]> it has to be with the location of the dll you are creating the interoperability with
