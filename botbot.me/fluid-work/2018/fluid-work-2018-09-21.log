2018-09-21T16:21:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve merged in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/933 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/934
2018-09-21T16:21:21 <Bosmon> Do you think you could take a look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/935 ?
2018-09-21T16:21:32 <Bosmon> Also, gmoss, did you get a chance to test out whether that resolved your problem?
2018-09-21T16:22:12 <Bosmon> I saw you gave a thumbs up but not sure whether this was just general enthusiasm : P
2018-09-21T16:22:22 <gmoss> Bosmon: I did not, no. I was laser-focused on 6300 :) it was general enthusiasm haha
2018-09-21T16:22:30 <gmoss> But I can test it out quickly right now
2018-09-21T16:24:09 <gmoss> oh dear, I have just fetched all of your infusion branches
2018-09-21T16:24:13 <gmoss> there are quite a few

2018-09-21T16:32:49 <Bosmon> I hear that he is thinking of changing his ways
2018-09-21T16:33:19 <Bosmon> I\'d certainly be happy for him to be courteous to everyone ... with the possible exception of the SVN developers
2018-09-21T16:34:57 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-09-21T16:39:11 <gmoss> Bosmon: It looks good, it ran through the whole test sequence from my 5633 branch. it failed a test, but at least it ran the test :)
2018-09-21T16:39:24 <Bosmon> gmoss that\'s awesome, thanks for checking!
2018-09-21T16:39:28 <gmoss> I was no longer seeing the error
2018-09-21T16:39:55 <Bosmon> I think the first fix you needed to make was correcting the context on the selector in the last sequence element
2018-09-21T16:40:04 <Bosmon> But it seemed there was a further problem after that
2018-09-21T16:40:05 <gmoss> yes
2018-09-21T16:40:26 <gmoss> and one which has been obsolesced
2018-09-21T16:41:01 <gmoss> which has obsolesced? anyway, it no longer applies :P thanks for addressing that issue so quickly

2018-09-21T16:55:08 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, it has been dying a death.
2018-09-21T16:55:21 <the-t-in-rtf> as soon as they killed search indexing its usefulness plummetted.

2018-09-21T17:43:17 <the-t-in-rtf> can we search the transcripts already, or is that to come later?
2018-09-21T17:43:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I miss being able to catch up with a search overnight.
2018-09-21T17:50:05 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: with the power of the plain-text log format, you\'ll be able to search using the power of the text editor of your choice :p

2018-09-21T20:07:12 <sgithens> cindyli the-t-in-rtf: I\'m looking at cleaning up an issue with our pouchTestCaseHolder for the preferences server, where we also need to include the lookup.json views from gpii-express-user. The issue is that the views.json is contained within a top-level array which the loader expects, but that the lookup.json view from gpii-express-user just has the view Object at the top-level which causes an error.  I\'m wondering if it
2018-09-21T20:07:12 <sgithens> would be better to 1: Modify the pouchTestCaseHolder|Harness etc to check if the document contains an array or Object at the top level, or modify the gpii-express-user project to have it\'s view wrapped in an array.
2018-09-21T20:11:03 <cindyli> nice catch, sgithens. either way looks good to me. let\'s see what the-t-in-rtf thinks as he\'s the author of both.
2018-09-21T20:12:54 <sgithens> cindyli: Cool, will do.  I had forgotten about it until I just deleted my node_modules and re-npm\'d

2018-09-21T21:11:58 <gmoss> Bosmon: I think the issue I\'m experiencing with my tests in FLUID-6300 may be due to my aggregate event upon which I am waiting to fire my tests. One of its sub-events, onSlidingPanelUpdated, will fire the first time UIO is loaded, which means that when onUioPanelsUpdated is fired after the first language change, the aggregate event will fire prematurely and trigger the tests before the change has actually finished
2018-09-21T21:12:06 <gmoss> in case you were still thinking about that issue :)
2018-09-21T21:12:34 <Bosmon> gmoss - that\'s pretty interesting
2018-09-21T21:12:43 <Bosmon> But I\'m not sure I remember that there was an existing issue with aggregate events
2018-09-21T21:13:01 <gmoss> I don\'t think it\'s misbehaving, it\'s more that I\'ve set it up in an unwise fashion
2018-09-21T21:13:55 <clown> fluid-bot: bye, and have a nice weekend
2018-09-21T21:13:55 <fluid-bot> clown: Error: "bye," is not a valid command.

2018-09-21T21:14:41 <fluid-bot> Bosmon: Error: "exeleutherostomize" is not a valid command.
2018-09-21T21:14:49 <Bosmon> Wow, so quick
2018-09-21T21:15:46 <Bosmon> gmoss - what should be the signal that the change has actually finished?
2018-09-21T21:17:29 <gmoss> for the slidingPanel component, it\'s one of the two possible events that fire after its refreshView function has happened. I have listeners on those which escalate to onSlidingPanelUpdated. for the other panels, I have a listener that fires "last" in a sequence which includes a call to fluid.prefs.separatedPanel.updateView. this seems to work as intended, when examining the timing
2018-09-21T21:17:54 <gmoss> but if, as I suspect, the initial firing of onSlidingPanelUpdated is making the aggregate event fire too soon, things will get tripped up
2018-09-21T21:18:49 <gmoss> I\'m just trying to think of a way to "ignore" onSlidingPanelUpdated when it shouldn\'t apply, or if that even makes sense
2018-09-21T21:20:58 <gmoss> is there a way to "reset" an aggregate event\'s counting?
2018-09-21T21:21:18 <gmoss> a jedi mind trick to say "you haven\'t heard this event fire yet"
2018-09-21T21:25:14 <Bosmon> gmoss - unfortunately not
2018-09-21T21:25:18 <gmoss> Bosmon: :(
2018-09-21T21:25:19 <Bosmon> I suggest you make a further event
2018-09-21T21:27:12 <gmoss> Bosmon: I\'ve started to go down this road a couple of times, Justin_o suggested it as well, but I got stuck at the point where  I\'m adding it to the list of the aggregate event. When should it fire? what will keep it from triggering the aggregate event the next time, since onSlidingPanelUpdated will still be counted early?
2018-09-21T21:27:31 <gmoss> I think I\'ve been looking at this far too long haha

2018-09-21T21:28:32 <Bosmon> gmoss - you just need to fire a further event at the time when the update corresponds to an update you are going to be interested in ....

2018-09-21T21:28:58 <sgithens> nice fluid-bot!
2018-09-21T21:30:48 <gmoss> Bosmon: at the risk of seeming obtuse, how does this differ from the update event that I\'m already listening for?
2018-09-21T21:31:41 <Bosmon> gmoss - well, someone must know that it is the right one :)
2018-09-21T21:31:54 <Bosmon> So tell me what are the components of this aggregate event?
2018-09-21T21:31:56 <gmoss> i.e. if I have "afterPanelHide.slidingPanelUpdated": "{fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor.localized}.events.onSlidingPanelUpdated", which listens to the event for that component that I\'m interested in, how do I fire an event at that time in a way that is materially different from what is already happening?

2018-09-21T21:34:19 <Bosmon> OK, and what is the situation which leads to this "false dawn"?
2018-09-21T21:34:24 <sgithens> :)
2018-09-21T21:36:27 <gmoss> Bosmon: I thought I had a good handle on the answer to your question, but it has given me pause
2018-09-21T21:39:31 <gmoss> I thought "the individual UIO panels weren\'t created until the language has changed", but this is not true. the prefsEditor component of prefsEditorLoader waits for templatesAndIframeReady before being created, so perhaps that\'s part of the answer
2018-09-21T21:39:49 <gmoss> there are many moving parts
2018-09-21T21:41:57 <gmoss> I think I\'m all out of brain juice for the day. Bosmon as always I appreciate your assistance
2018-09-21T21:42:06 <Bosmon> Sorry I haven\'t given much yet
2018-09-21T21:42:18 <gmoss> you have indeed
2018-09-21T21:42:28 <gmoss> the socratic questioning is useful

2018-09-21T21:45:05 <gmoss> thanks again!
2018-09-21T21:45:14 <Bosmon> OK, sorry it\'s so complex
2018-09-21T21:45:22 <Bosmon> I promise it will go away eventually : P
2018-09-21T21:45:45 <gmoss> hahaha no worries. I think my relative lack of understanding of the system has contributed, not only the nature of the system
2018-09-21T21:46:17 <Bosmon> Well, it should just work
2018-09-21T21:46:25 <Bosmon> Without any of this nonsensical "recreating panels" etc.

2018-09-21T13:53:33 <stegru> Justin_o, the zoom fix is great! Just one small issue with it sometimes being multiples of 5, but that\'s nothing.
2018-09-21T13:54:59 <Justin_o> stegru: what do you mean by sometimes being multiples of 5?
2018-09-21T13:56:25 <stegru> chrome can set the zoom to 125, which makes UIO+ 1.25, and UIO+\'s increments are 0.1.. which means you can\'t set it back to exactly 1 (100%)
2018-09-21T13:56:35 <stegru> it disturbed me for a few seconds
2018-09-21T13:56:48 <stegru> it\'s not important, just mentioning it
2018-09-21T13:58:18 <Justin_o> ah yes that.. so there are a few ways to get it back to 1. 1) you can type into the field and set it to 1. 2) you can increase the size to the max and then decrease back to 1. 3) you can use the browser to reset to 100%
2018-09-21T13:58:28 <stegru> i know :)
2018-09-21T13:59:29 <Justin_o> I was thinking of changing the increments to 0.5 but thought they\'d be too small and i think there is a 67% and 33% value in through chrome as well, so that wouldn\'t have worked for them.. so i left it as is..
2018-09-21T13:59:55 <stegru> yeh, who cares
2018-09-21T14:00:37 <Justin_o> haha it was bugging me for a bit too
2018-09-21T14:04:45 <Justin_o> stegru: how soon would you need another beta of UIO+ published?
2018-09-21T14:07:00 <stegru> Justin_o: sometime next week, I guess

2018-09-21T14:56:13 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, @stegru, @sgithens or anyone familiar with the Windows solutions data.
2018-09-21T14:56:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Is this intentional?
2018-09-21T14:56:16 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3823
2018-09-21T14:56:31 <the-t-in-rtf> It appears to be a "transforms" block without an associated capability.
2018-09-21T14:56:52 <Bosmon> It\'s got an inputPath
2018-09-21T14:57:34 <Bosmon> hmm
2018-09-21T14:57:40 <the-t-in-rtf> This is another example
2018-09-21T14:57:40 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3892
2018-09-21T14:57:57 <the-t-in-rtf> the input path is "", which isn\'t all that helpful.
2018-09-21T14:58:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, is this a pattern that means something?
2018-09-21T14:58:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Do something to all settings for this application before writing, for example?
2018-09-21T14:58:27 <Bosmon> It\'s just another transform block
2018-09-21T14:58:33 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but what does it transform?
2018-09-21T14:58:48 <Bosmon> The first thing you pasted was nested within "capabilitiesTransformations"
2018-09-21T14:58:54 <Bosmon> And the 2nd thing you pasted was in the inverse
2018-09-21T14:58:58 <Bosmon> They\'re just unusually large
2018-09-21T14:59:09 <stegru> Considering I did it, I don\'t think it was intentional
2018-09-21T14:59:10 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but it\'s not in a block related to a generic term like all the other examples.
2018-09-21T14:59:20 <Justin_o> jhernandez: i published beta 8 or UIO+. It should be on the chrome web store in an hour. So it should be ready to go for the pilot installs next week.
2018-09-21T14:59:51 <Bosmon> You mean an application-specific term, but yes, it does look suspicious
2018-09-21T15:00:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean that it\'s not keyed by the related generic term.
2018-09-21T15:00:08 <the-t-in-rtf> like this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3855
2018-09-21T15:00:25 <Bosmon> That, again is an inverse block
2018-09-21T15:00:47 <the-t-in-rtf> right, so in capabilities transforms, it\'s not keyed by an application-specific term.
2018-09-21T15:00:52 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-09-21T15:00:57 <Bosmon> I agree it looks suspicious
2018-09-21T15:01:15 <Bosmon> Although it\'s interesting that someone has considered it with sufficient care as to write a valid inverse for it
2018-09-21T15:02:52 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2018-09-21T15:03:06 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, are you adding more things to this solution? or just finding faults?
2018-09-21T15:03:19 <Bosmon> It\'s because it multiplexes together three existing declared top-level application-specific settings
2018-09-21T15:03:40 <Bosmon> These three:                     "CoupleNarratorCursorKeyboard": {},
2018-09-21T15:03:40 <Bosmon> "FollowInsertion": {},
2018-09-21T15:03:40 <Bosmon> "InteractionMouse": {},
2018-09-21T15:03:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I am reviewing the data at the moment.
2018-09-21T15:03:49 <Bosmon> That\'s why it doesn\'t declare any one of them in particular
2018-09-21T15:04:51 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, it\'s fine for now.
2018-09-21T15:05:12 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, the reason I asked is that I\'m inferring the schema information for application-specific settings by reading the transforms.
2018-09-21T15:05:24 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. that\'s at least one representation of the expected values.
2018-09-21T15:05:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I am not adding anything, just trying to understand well enough to flesh out schema data for all solutions settings.
2018-09-21T15:06:20 <stegru> ok, just that there\'s a PR for that solution
2018-09-21T15:06:38 <the-t-in-rtf> it should be fine.
2018-09-21T15:06:41 <stegru> doesn\'t effect that line, https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/622/files
2018-09-21T15:06:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m only changing the supported settings blocks.
2018-09-21T15:07:57 <jhernandez> Justin_o: sweet, thanks!!
2018-09-21T15:13:49 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, interesting, they are adding schema data.
2018-09-21T15:13:54 <the-t-in-rtf> but not for the last three.
2018-09-21T15:17:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess you asked for that.
2018-09-21T15:17:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I will coordinate with JJ on Monday.
2018-09-21T15:17:42 <the-t-in-rtf> the approach is still useful, I just need to focus somewhere we no one else is entering data.
2018-09-21T15:17:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for pointing out the overlap, @stegru.

2018-09-21T15:41:41 <gmoss> Justin_o: are you available to pair on FLUID-6300 some today?
2018-09-21T15:41:59 <gmoss> I\'m experiencing writer\'s block :]
2018-09-21T15:43:01 <cindyli> gmoss: i can take a look too if you send me a link to the code
2018-09-21T15:46:41 <gmoss> cindyli: that would be great. thanks! https://github.com/blueslug/infusion/tree/FLUID-6300 is the branch I\'m working in. the issue is that I\'m experiencing is with the UI Options component test, where the third set of tests (locale changing with lazyLoad activated) will fail on slower devices (reproduces reliably with firefox on windows for me, or using an app to throttle the CPU)
2018-09-21T15:47:02 <gmoss> I don\'t know if I should tell you more or if it would be better for you to dig in with fresh eyes
2018-09-21T15:47:40 <cindyli> ok. let\'s see if i can reproduce it
2018-09-21T15:47:42 <gmoss> it\'s a race condition though. Essentially it seems like when the tests start after changing the language, the changing operation hasn\'t quite finished

2018-09-21T16:01:37 <Bosmon> Hi there gmoss - I\'m also observing a stall with some of the existing tests in trunk
2018-09-21T16:01:43 <Bosmon> Particularly in IE11
2018-09-21T16:01:44 <cindyli> gmoss: does that test fail on units 18-33
2018-09-21T16:01:49 <Bosmon> Who knows if it may turn out to be related
2018-09-21T16:02:01 <Bosmon> But quite often I get a stall on "UIOptions Locale Tests: UIO defaultLocale tests"
2018-09-21T16:03:15 <Bosmon> I\'ll write it up if it is not currently known
2018-09-21T16:04:38 <gmoss> Bosmon: I don\'t recall noticing any stalling, in my work on this particular test I\'ve been running the test on its own. Is stalling something that could cause, for instance, a fluid.resourceLoader to report that it has finished loading resources when in fact it hasn\'t quite finished? (i\'m not sure that what i\'ve just described is even happening, but it\'s something I\'ve floated as a cause)
2018-09-21T16:04:45 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'ve completed flat matchmaker + apptology. a new problem is discovered that this version has problem matching application specific common terms. for example, the match result for "http://registry.gpii.net/applications/org.nvda-project" will return windows.narrator instead of nvda. investigating...
2018-09-21T16:05:44 <gmoss> cindyli: 18-33 or 18-49, but for me lately it\'s been 18-49
2018-09-21T16:06:46 <gmoss> whatever things I have happening when onInterfaceLocaleChangeRequested is fired don\'t seem to be finishing before the call to verifyPanelMessages() in the test sequence
2018-09-21T16:07:02 <Bosmon> gmoss - it could never report it is done when it isn\'t... but there is lots of room for a startup tangle in amongst the mass of UIO startup events
2018-09-21T16:07:08 <cindyli> gmoss: i noticed if i ran the third test alone in firefox, it constantly fails on 18-33. but when running it with 2 other tests, it never fails. (well, only tried about 3 times tho)
2018-09-21T16:07:26 <Bosmon> But yes, it is verifyPanelMessages implicated in my stall as well
2018-09-21T16:07:35 <gmoss> cindyli: curious.. i\'d suggest trying to tie up your CPU and see what happens
2018-09-21T16:08:26 <Bosmon> I\'m a little disturbed by this selector which as prefsEditor in it twice
2018-09-21T16:08:33 <gmoss> indeed
2018-09-21T16:08:34 <Bosmon> {prefsEditorBaseTest prefsEditor prefsEditorLoader prefsEditor}.events.onReady
2018-09-21T16:08:58 <gmoss> the first is the name of the test UIO component, the second is the component of prefsEditorLoader called prefsEditor
2018-09-21T16:09:35 <gmoss> if you have any suggestions to make that more readable or less smelly, please feel free!
2018-09-21T16:09:56 <Bosmon> You could just get rid of the first one : P
2018-09-21T16:10:06 * michelled joined the channel
2018-09-21T16:10:36 <gmoss> done :)
2018-09-21T16:11:03 <Bosmon> gmoss - in any case, here it is: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6343
2018-09-21T16:13:33 <gmoss> Bosmon: thank you! I\'ll keep an eye out for that particular issue. I don\'t recall seeing it
2018-09-21T16:15:34 <gmoss> Bosmon cindyli: I have noticed that there\'s a duplicate call to fluid.resourceLoader.loadResources with the lazyLoad on, since the reloadUioMessages function calls it and then firing onLazyLoad leads to it being called again. I\'m currently fiddling with a solution to remove that duplication
2018-09-21T16:17:03 <cindyli> nice discovery
2018-09-21T16:20:39 <gmoss> my fix seems to reliably limit the errors to the third round of tests, units 34 to 49
