b'2018-02-22T16:05:36 <Bosmon> Looks like gpii-express and gpii-pouchdb are bound to back-versions
2018-02-22T16:05:46 * alanharnum has quit
2018-02-22T16:05:49 <Bosmon> And so no surprise that they are involved in the previous stack trace
2018-02-22T16:06:20 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-02-22T16:06:27 <Bosmon> Looks like there have been 3 releases of gpii-express since then
2018-02-22T16:06:34 <Bosmon> So it might just be as simple as updating
2018-02-22T16:07:05 <jhernandez> okay
2018-02-22T16:07:32 <jhernandez> do you want me to do so?
2018-02-22T16:07:55 * alanharnum has quit
2018-02-22T16:08:02 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-02-22T16:08:09 <Bosmon> Yes, try to update gpii-express to 1.0.12 and gpii-pouchdb to 1.0.9
2018-02-22T16:08:20 <Bosmon> And see what explodes then : P
2018-02-22T16:08:43 <jhernandez> hehe
2018-02-22T16:08:51 <jhernandez> okay
2018-02-22T16:08:57 <Bosmon> thanks!
2018-02-22T16:09:01 <jhernandez> thanks to you
2018-02-22T16:09:05 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-02-22T16:10:28 <Bosmon> Don\'t thank me until you see the results :)
2018-02-22T16:11:24 <Bosmon> Yay thanks cindyli!
2018-02-22T16:11:39 <cindyli> np
2018-02-22T16:11:41 <Bosmon> I guess I can just do a wholesale update of universal deps now
2018-02-22T16:12:57 <Bosmon> New infusion release: 3.0.0-dev.20180222T160835Z.6e1311a
2018-02-22T16:21:38 <jhernandez> Bosmon: updating gpii-pouchdb did the trick
2018-02-22T16:21:40 <jhernandez> now the tests are passing
2018-02-22T16:21:49 <Bosmon> jhernandez - fantastic
2018-02-22T16:22:31 <Bosmon> My pull should go into CI ANY MOMENT NOW ...
2018-02-22T16:22:32 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/590
2018-02-22T16:23:08 <jhernandez> yes, I saw it coming
2018-02-22T16:23:19 <jhernandez> and you don\'t have to remember CI to trigger the build
2018-02-22T16:23:21 <jhernandez> xD
2018-02-22T16:24:28 <jhernandez> well, we can improve the plugin to determine that if you open a pull request and you also write an "ok to test", that pr is super top priority, so any other ci jobs must stop :P
2018-02-22T16:27:35 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2018-02-22T16:27:54 <Bosmon> The pull must be processed CON URGENZIA .......
2018-02-22T16:31:58 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m], clown, stegru, jhernandez - is now good for Windows?
2018-02-22T16:32:16 <clown> Bosmon:  good for me .  Room 3?
2018-02-22T16:32:17 <stegru> aye sir
2018-02-22T16:32:45 <jhernandez> sure, I can open the room if you want to
2018-02-22T16:33:13 <stegru> that would be handy
2018-02-22T16:33:30 <jhernandez> already there
2018-02-22T16:33:32 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-02-22T16:34:50 <javjarfer[m]> yes
2018-02-22T16:36:46 <javjarfer[m]> going!

2018-02-22T10:59:33 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I am still struggling with the integration tests. Whereas the webview tests are running fine now, the dialogManager tests are failing
2018-02-22T10:59:33 <georgitodorov> Again there is the "TypeError: Cannot read property \'execute\' of undefined" error
2018-02-22T11:00:20 <georgitodorov> What is even more weird is that the framework reports that more tests than actually were queued in the sequence have passed
2018-02-22T11:01:34 <georgitodorov> I do not think that the issue here is related to FLUID-5502 as there are no back to back listeners in the sequence definition
2018-02-22T11:06:56 <georgitodorov> I guess that there are some dangling instances of the surveyDialog for which some of the tests are executed again
2018-02-22T11:10:31 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - ok, if you can check in the current state of your branch, I can investigate
2018-02-22T11:10:52 <Bosmon> There may be yet some further uncharacterised bug causing the problem ...
2018-02-22T11:11:06 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - do the dialogManager tests pass by themselves if you comment out all the others?
2018-02-22T11:11:22 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: No, they don\'t
2018-02-22T11:11:31 <Bosmon> georgitodorov ok, that\'s good
2018-02-22T11:11:38 <Bosmon> Should make it fairly easy to characterise the issue
2018-02-22T11:11:52 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I have just pushed to GPII-2732
2018-02-22T11:12:24 <georgitodorov> I merged GPII/master into it and reinstalled the node modules. Don\'t know if there is anything else that needs to be done.
2018-02-22T11:17:50 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I can comment out one of the tests in the dialogManager which will eliminate the creation of further surveyDialogs and thus everything will pass
2018-02-22T11:19:34 <georgitodorov> In case the issue seems difficult to fix
2018-02-22T11:21:00 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - my guess is that this issue is some unsolved variant of FLUID-5633
2018-02-22T11:21:00 <Bosmon> Since you have the same pattern in these tests of distributing an IoCSS listener to the same target twice in succession
2018-02-22T11:21:00 <Bosmon> But we will see shortly
2018-02-22T11:21:01 <Bosmon> There was already one uncaught edge case in my fix which was caught by cindyli\'s review
2018-02-22T11:21:04 <Bosmon> And there may well be another one
2018-02-22T11:21:13 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: But we are doing essentially the same in the webview tests and they do pass :/

2018-02-22T11:54:55 <vdego> HEllo everyone! My name is Victor, a current Computer Science student. I was looking through the Google Summer of Code projects and ran into this organization. I am especially interested in the project regarding importing external data to MyL3, but I have some questions. I\'d really appreciate if someone could get in touch with me! Thank you all for your time :)

2018-02-22T11:58:51 <stegru> vdego: Hi, I think the people who you would like to speak with will be here in a few hours - you might want to ask again later?
2018-02-22T11:59:55 <vdego> Ok, thanks for the info! I\'ll check back a bit later then
2018-02-22T12:04:40 <Bosmon> Hey there georgitodorov - ok, I think I have found the fresh bug
2018-02-22T12:05:07 <Bosmon> But now I put in the correct, I think this shows that you have a bug of your own in the dialogManager tests
2018-02-22T12:05:17 <Bosmon> In that you have a "show" and a "hide" operation which are not inverses of each other
2018-02-22T12:05:32 <Bosmon> The behaviour is now that the dialogManager tests hang rather than crashing
2018-02-22T12:05:43 <Bosmon> But I will go over this again to double-check it ....
2018-02-22T12:07:12 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Yes, the operations are different when the survey dialog is concerned
2018-02-22T12:07:42 <georgitodorov> Showing a survey dialog fires an event which creates a new component whereas the hide simply hides the BrowserWindow
2018-02-22T12:08:18 <georgitodorov> What do you think is wrong with the show/hide tests?
2018-02-22T12:09:21 <Bosmon> Oh, I see - so you expect that both a hide and a closed will have the effect of destroying the component?
2018-02-22T12:11:26 <Bosmon> In which case I suspect the remaining bug is also still mine ...
2018-02-22T12:12:07 <Bosmon> Well no
2018-02-22T12:12:08 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: No, the hide simply hides the dialog which is visible to the user without destroying the components
2018-02-22T12:12:21 * Justin_o joined the channel
2018-02-22T12:12:37 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - so there will then be two surveyDialogs open on line 111?
2018-02-22T12:13:52 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: No, because the surveyDialog is a subcomponent of the survey component and has the "createOnEvent" property
2018-02-22T12:14:09 <Bosmon> ah, wah
2018-02-22T12:14:15 <georgitodorov> The former instance should be automatically destroyed in this case, right?
2018-02-22T12:14:22 <Bosmon> So it will be destroyed and recreated as part of the event firing
2018-02-22T12:14:48 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Yes, this was the idea
2018-02-22T12:14:52 <Bosmon> ok, this is fascinating
2018-02-22T12:14:59 <Bosmon> I think I can accommodate this case
2018-02-22T12:15:04 <Bosmon> But I need a sandwich : P
2018-02-22T12:15:33 <Bosmon> As part of my fix, I put in a branch that determines that if it ALREADY finds a single component which matches the IoCSS selector, that it must be the one for which the listener is required
2018-02-22T12:15:49 <Bosmon> And so it does not at the same time add a distribution advising any such component in the future
2018-02-22T12:16:11 <Bosmon> In the case the component is there NOW but is not the one that will be there when the event fires, the listener is lost

2018-02-22T12:19:38 <Bosmon> I will spend the afternoon working up these two fixes into two further test cases and then push further updates through the system
2018-02-22T12:19:48 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Great! Will we again go through the process of three PR as yesterday?

2018-02-22T15:54:40 <jhernandez> not sure if related to the IoCSS problems, but I\'m sharing it with you just in case
2018-02-22T15:54:42 <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/2sPAc4LP
2018-02-22T15:54:52 <Bosmon> Thanks for doing that testing, jhernandez
2018-02-22T15:55:21 <jhernandez> this happens when trying to run the acceptance tests
2018-02-22T15:55:42 <jhernandez> unitTests are okay and the system "seems" to be working fine
2018-02-22T15:55:52 <Bosmon> It\'s rather bizarre since this stack trace is rather circular
2018-02-22T15:56:40 <Bosmon> It seems to pass through gpii.loadTestingSupport twice
2018-02-22T15:57:35 <Bosmon> Looks like some kind of failure is triggered during the index.js of gpii-express at line 100
2018-02-22T15:57:50 <jhernandez> well, I had to add both infusion and node-jqUnit into windows\' package.json, since it was complaining about not finding them
2018-02-22T15:58:08 <Bosmon> jhernandez - you mustn\'t do that : P
2018-02-22T15:58:17 <jhernandez> herrh
2018-02-22T15:58:31 <Bosmon> jhernandez - this was with npm 5, I guess?
2018-02-22T15:58:35 <jhernandez> yup
2018-02-22T15:58:37 <Bosmon> ok
2018-02-22T15:58:42 <Bosmon> Looks like an issue for the-t-in-rtf and me
2018-02-22T15:58:58 <Bosmon> since there seems to be some fresh cause of circularity between our modules
2018-02-22T15:59:16 <Bosmon> You can see that PouchTestCaseHolder.js and gpii-express are involved in the cycle
2018-02-22T15:59:28 <jhernandez> let me try if I can get rid of it by don\'t adding infusion as a dep
2018-02-22T15:59:41 <Bosmon> Yes, or at least let me know what the failure is in that case
2018-02-22T15:59:55 <jhernandez> but yeah, I guess that it still needs to be fixed anyway
2018-02-22T15:59:58 <jhernandez> sure
2018-02-22T16:01:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez - so it looks like this line triggers an error: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express/blob/master/tests/js/lib/index.js#L3
2018-02-22T16:01:27 <Bosmon> Presumably because the previous line produces an incompletely loaded infusion
2018-02-22T16:03:22 <jhernandez> heh
2018-02-22T16:03:27 <jhernandez> interesting
2018-02-22T16:03:31 <jhernandez> re-npm installed
2018-02-22T16:03:45 <jhernandez> and now the problem is a duped infusion
2018-02-22T16:03:49 <Bosmon> And then the rest of the trace looks like a copy of its attempt to restart the loading of all modules
2018-02-22T16:04:02 <Bosmon> jhernandez - did you rm -rf node_modules first?
2018-02-22T16:04:06 <jhernandez> yup
2018-02-22T16:04:09 <Bosmon> ok
2018-02-22T16:04:14 <Bosmon> What does npm ls infusion say?
2018-02-22T16:04:47 <Bosmon> It should be impossible to have a duped infusion with any version later than November of last year ..........
2018-02-22T16:04:59 <Bosmon> But I guess there are always fresh corner cases to be found
