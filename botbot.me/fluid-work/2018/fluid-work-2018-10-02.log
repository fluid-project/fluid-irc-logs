b'2018-10-02T13:58:00 <Bosmon> I still get "Cannot read property \'common-language\' of undefined" as before
2018-10-02T14:00:16 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Execute `npm run build` before running the tests
2018-10-02T14:00:34 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I did
2018-10-02T14:00:37 <Bosmon> A few times : P
2018-10-02T14:00:40 <Bosmon> But I think I see the problem
2018-10-02T14:00:58 <Bosmon> I have a few stray electron.exe processes running, and it seems that the build process doesn\'t report a failure if the file is locked...
2018-10-02T14:01:05 * Jess_ joined the channel
2018-10-02T14:01:41 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Oh, I see
2018-10-02T14:08:19 * alanharnum has quit
2018-10-02T14:13:41 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - is it usual for the message compiler to take a very long time?
2018-10-02T14:13:48 <Bosmon> 07:10:12.533:  Registering module gpii-glob from path V:\
ode_modules\\gpii-glob
2018-10-02T14:13:48 <Bosmon> Running "compileMessages:defaults" (compileMessages) task
2018-10-02T14:13:48 <Bosmon> 07:11:49.092:  Registering module gpii-universal from path V:\
ode_modules\\gpii-universal
2018-10-02T14:14:04 <Bosmon> What interesting is that the long delay is actually before the "compileMessages" message
2018-10-02T14:14:15 <Bosmon> I wonder what the system is doing in these 1.5 minutes
2018-10-02T14:15:07 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The delay shouldn\'t be that much
2018-10-02T14:18:44 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - it seems consistent
2018-10-02T14:18:51 <Bosmon> I can at least run some of the tests correctly now
2018-10-02T14:19:08 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I get a hang at the following test:
2018-10-02T14:19:09 <Bosmon> "args": [
2018-10-02T14:19:09 <Bosmon> "When the decrease volume button is pressed, the PSP is notified accordingly",
2018-10-02T14:19:25 <Bosmon> Interestingly just before this I get this notification to the metrics:
2018-10-02T14:19:26 <Bosmon> 07:17:26.549:  {
2018-10-02T14:19:26 <Bosmon> "module": "metrics",
2018-10-02T14:19:26 <Bosmon> "event": "solution-failed",
2018-10-02T14:19:26 <Bosmon> "level": "INFO",
2018-10-02T14:19:26 <Bosmon> "data": {
2018-10-02T14:19:27 <Bosmon> "solutionID": "com.microsoft.windows.volumeControl"
2018-10-02T14:19:27 <Bosmon> }
2018-10-02T14:19:28 <Bosmon> }
2018-10-02T14:19:45 <Bosmon> I wonder if this is some consequence of running the tests within the VM of the vagrant box?
2018-10-02T14:20:26 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I am working on a native Windows 10 machine so I can\'t really tell
2018-10-02T14:20:49 <georgitodorov> What if you comment out these tests?
2018-10-02T14:21:07 <georgitodorov> As a whole if you comment out the qss test definitions?
2018-10-02T14:24:32 <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon, regarding the messageCompiler slowest step should be the requiring `gpii-universal`. On the other hand, I\xe2\x80\x99ve also experienced some delay with way simpler compiler
2018-10-02T14:27:52 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - if I comment out this definition I get a bit further into the tests
2018-10-02T14:27:57 <Bosmon> The next problem I face is at this test:
2018-10-02T14:27:59 <Bosmon> 07:26:43.084:  Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 6 of 6 sequence element {

2018-10-02T14:27:59 <Bosmon> "listener": "jqUnit.assertFalse",
2018-10-02T14:27:59 <Bosmon> "args": [
2018-10-02T14:27:59 <Bosmon> "The error dialog is closed when its close button is clicked",
2018-10-02T14:28:00 <Bosmon> "{that}.app.dialogManager.error.dialog.model.isShown"
2018-10-02T14:28:00 <Bosmon> ]
2018-10-02T14:28:01 <Bosmon> } of fixture User errors handler integration tests
2018-10-02T14:28:25 <Bosmon> It seems that in this case it takes so long to actually open the error dialog that we miss the attempt to close it
2018-10-02T14:28:49 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I am not sure why there are such huge differences when running tests on different machines
2018-10-02T14:29:28 <georgitodorov> I haven\'t encountered that error at all
2018-10-02T14:29:39 <Bosmon> In any case CI will attempt to run the tests in a VM so we should try to see what the cause of the volume control failure is
2018-10-02T14:29:53 <Bosmon> In the meantime I will try to update my vagrant box to see if it makes any difference
2018-10-02T14:30:42 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, I will try the tests in a VM tomorrow
2018-10-02T14:37:52 * georgitodorov has quit
2018-10-02T14:44:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: when i ran "npm run test:noCoverage" from danail/fix/qssTests, without commenting anything extra, got this error:

2018-10-02T14:44:46 <cindyli> } of fixture PSP integration tests
2018-10-02T14:44:57 <cindyli> it\'s from pspTestDefs
2018-10-02T14:45:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that is the one I got
2018-10-02T14:45:02 <Bosmon> See above
2018-10-02T14:45:13 <Bosmon> It seems like it is some kind of failure to apply the volume control setting within the VM
2018-10-02T14:45:24 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-02T14:45:33 <Bosmon> You can comment out "gpii.tests.psp.testDefs" and see if you can go on to the next failure I got :)
2018-10-02T14:45:50 <Bosmon> Although I had thought that our volume control solution was a fake
2018-10-02T14:45:57 <Bosmon> Is there a possibility there is a real one? : P
2018-10-02T14:46:27 <cindyli> i will try. maybe i should only leave line 109 open and comment all others

2018-10-02T14:58:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: the old real volume control solution was jaws. not sure if you have it installed. but i don\'t think jaws is installed in the gpii-app windows VM that I\'m using. the real real one might be to create a new solution that uses windows system volume control. ;)

2018-10-02T15:14:47 <Bosmon> We just need to understand how the lack of one makes this test fail : P
2018-10-02T15:15:55 * oem__ joined the channel
2018-10-02T15:18:15 <cindyli> that\'s true. unless the test failure was from checking the real system volume, the test should not fail with a fake solution
2018-10-02T15:19:19 <cindyli> after commenting the first a few lines till psp.testDefs, i can run thru all tests and hit this error over and over:

2018-10-02T15:21:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - "Object has been destroyed" is a red herring caused by an race condition within electron
2018-10-02T15:21:24 <Bosmon> You can ignore errors like that because they occur after the test run has concluded, during the process shutdown
2018-10-02T15:21:33 <cindyli> i see
2018-10-02T15:23:08 <cindyli> have to look for other errors then

2018-10-02T16:29:30 <Bosmon> Can we see which test that failure is a part of, and if it runs successfully in isolation?
2018-10-02T16:30:12 <cindyli> ya, commenting one by one ...
2018-10-02T16:34:55 <cindyli> so far, it seems this error cannot be reproduced consistently even with the ONE case that all are uncommented

2018-10-02T11:57:21 <stegru> doing it now
2018-10-02T11:57:26 <jhernandez> great
2018-10-02T11:58:24 <jhernandez> Bosmon: shall we create a branch of gpii-app for this release?
2018-10-02T11:59:01 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I guess so since we are still not 100% on getting all of gpii-app into trunk
2018-10-02T11:59:08 <jhernandez> yup
2018-10-02T11:59:10 <jhernandez> codename?

2018-10-02T11:59:16 <Bosmon> But hopefully we are very close

2018-10-02T12:02:59 <jhernandez> stegru: last time I checked, mounting google drive was a PITA

2018-10-02T12:05:17 <stegru> hmm, I can add a google account to gnome

2018-10-02T12:46:57 <jhernandez> stegru: which one do I need tot use for the filebeat thing, your gpii-app/GPII-3315 or GPII-3155-master \xc2\xbf?
2018-10-02T12:47:10 <stegru> hmm
2018-10-02T12:47:18 <jhernandez> which are the differences?
2018-10-02T12:47:27 <jhernandez> *which/what
2018-10-02T12:48:15 <stegru> so there,s gpii-app#58, and gpii-wix-installer#41
2018-10-02T12:48:34 <jhernandez> already pulled gpii-wix-installer#41 into my local branch
2018-10-02T12:49:19 <stegru> sorry, I don\'t understand your question.. there\'s only gpii-app#58
2018-10-02T12:49:45 <stegru> you need both of those
2018-10-02T12:50:18 <jhernandez> ok, your GPII-3155-master then
2018-10-02T12:50:38 <stegru> ok ok I get what you mean now.. yes
2018-10-02T12:52:05 <jhernandez> sure, thanks
2018-10-02T12:52:07 <jhernandez> :)
2018-10-02T12:52:22 <stegru> all that fix does is copy filebeat.msm from provisioning to the installer clone
2018-10-02T12:53:06 <stegru> because you, the builder person, can\'t put it directly in the installer\'s directory, because it\'s wiped and cloned when you start the build
2018-10-02T12:53:14 <jhernandez> yup, but got confused because of GPII-3315 vs GPII-3155
2018-10-02T12:53:17 <jhernandez> it was that
2018-10-02T12:53:27 <stegru> ahh i see
2018-10-02T12:53:47 <jhernandez> okay, put to build the installer
2018-10-02T12:54:20 <jhernandez> let\'s wait 15 mins or so (if it don\'t crashes before)
2018-10-02T12:54:36 <jhernandez> I\'m leaving for half an hour
2018-10-02T12:54:43 <jhernandez> will test when I\'m back
2018-10-02T12:54:57 <stegru> ok
2018-10-02T13:03:55 * simonjb joined the channel

2018-10-02T13:22:46 <jhernandez> stegru: build was fine
2018-10-02T13:22:49 <jhernandez> now I\'m installing
2018-10-02T13:23:00 <stegru> ok good
2018-10-02T13:24:30 <jhernandez> after that, how do I know that filebeat "works" ?
2018-10-02T13:26:53 <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2018-10-02T13:27:21 <stegru> look in the process list for "filebeat"
2018-10-02T13:27:23 <jhernandez> I can see filebeat running on the system
2018-10-02T13:27:31 <stegru> it worked
2018-10-02T13:27:31 <jhernandez> that was my first test
2018-10-02T13:27:39 <jhernandez> that\'s all?
2018-10-02T13:27:52 <jhernandez> aren\'t we going to check that things are being uploaded somewhere?
2018-10-02T13:28:29 <stegru> there will be some logs in c:\\ProgramData\\Morphic\\Filebeat
2018-10-02T13:29:43 <jhernandez> it\'s there
2018-10-02T13:32:13 <jhernandez> should I open one and check its content
2018-10-02T13:32:18 <jhernandez> anything in particular to check?
2018-10-02T13:32:31 <stegru> it should be obvious
2018-10-02T13:32:50 <stegru> I don\'t know what exactly
2018-10-02T13:33:06 <jhernandez> INFO Elasticsearch url: https://6fc0765023c599b0c3e26479fe9c0895.us-east-1.aws.found.io:443
2018-10-02T13:33:14 <stegru> i\'m just figuring out how to check elastic search

2018-10-02T13:34:41 <jhernandez> stegru: here\'s the content https://pastebin.com/faRxSwfF
2018-10-02T13:35:52 <stegru> hm, doesn\'t say anything obvious
2018-10-02T13:36:11 <jhernandez> stegru: in any case
2018-10-02T13:36:51 <jhernandez> the machinery for GPII-3315 works, merging now
2018-10-02T13:36:53 <jhernandez> ;)

2018-10-02T13:40:21 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, jhernandez, cindyli: We have made some good progress on fixing the failing tests in the GPII app. We made some changes and every test definition runs okay on its own. Some test definitions run fine together, too.
2018-10-02T13:40:52 <georgitodorov> However, when some tests are run together with others, some weird thing happens - more tests than actually expected are run
2018-10-02T13:40:53 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: The Deaf Culture Centre post is now live -- could you take a look?
2018-10-02T13:41:22 <jhung> fluid-everyone: there is no design crit today. Thanks!
2018-10-02T13:41:24 <georgitodorov> I remember that we had a similar issue before and it was related to dynamically created components
2018-10-02T13:41:30 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I\'ve also increased the size of the headings
2018-10-02T13:42:29 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, jhernandez, cindyli: We would greatly appreciate if someone can take a look at our "test fixes" branch as we are running out of ideas: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/fix/qssTests/tests
2018-10-02T13:42:57 <georgitodorov> Right now, if you execute `npm run test:noCoverage`, everything should be fine.
2018-10-02T13:43:29 <georgitodorov> If you uncomment https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/fix/qssTests/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L110 or the following line (or both), tests start failing
2018-10-02T13:43:55 <georgitodorov> If you uncomment line 110 and comment out everything else, everything will be fine again...
2018-10-02T13:44:27 <sepidehshahi> Hi simonjb: thanks, I just sent you the synthesis report for session#1 and all the documents including the raw data
2018-10-02T13:45:11 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: not sure I\'m the best person to look at this, I\'ll defer to cindyli and Bosmon to help you on this one
2018-10-02T13:45:21 <jhernandez> also, I need to leave now :/
2018-10-02T13:45:21 <cindyli> georgitodorov: interesting, i will give a try
2018-10-02T13:45:22 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: great, could you also send me the photo for the Community Living Ontario post?
2018-10-02T13:45:27 <jhernandez> cindyli: thanks!
2018-10-02T13:45:36 <sepidehshahi> sure simonjb
2018-10-02T13:45:54 <jhernandez> stegru: just merged your filebeat thing, both in gpii-wix-installer/HST and in gpii-app/ajc3
2018-10-02T13:46:35 <jhernandez> do you mind taking care of this one? https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/44
2018-10-02T13:47:07 <jhernandez> I think that\'s the last thing before adding the GPII_CLOUD_URL thing :)

2018-10-02T13:51:54 <georgitodorov> Thank you, cindyli and Bosmon.
2018-10-02T13:56:31 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov, I am still having trouble running the branch in qssTests
2018-10-02T13:56:59 <Bosmon> Although I have run npm install and grunt build a few times, it is still not finding the message bundle
