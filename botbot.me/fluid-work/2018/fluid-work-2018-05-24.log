2018-05-24T08:41:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi,  @jhernandez_ or anyone else familiar, I'm just going through JIRA tickets per the call to action in last night's meeting.
2018-05-24T08:41:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I ran across one of Ale's that seems like it's ready to close and wanted to confirm.
2018-05-24T08:41:47 <the-t-in-rtf> issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2206
2018-05-24T08:41:58 <the-t-in-rtf> The associated PR has been merged.
2018-05-24T08:42:37 <the-t-in-rtf> There are others that Ale reported, but those are still in progress.
2018-05-24T08:43:18 <the-t-in-rtf> There is also this larger one with various associated merged pulls: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2402
2018-05-24T08:43:42 <the-t-in-rtf> It's less clear to me whether that one can be closed.
2018-05-24T08:52:45 <jhernandez_> the-t-in-rtf: hey
2018-05-24T08:52:53 <jhernandez_> thanks for doing this
2018-05-24T08:53:03 <jhernandez_> yes, both of them can be closed IMO
2018-05-24T08:53:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, thanks.
2018-05-24T09:02:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyone following the JSON Schema discussions, I have rolled up the existing issues that will be addressed in the 2.0 release of gpii-json-schema.

2018-05-24T11:29:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @sgithens.
2018-05-24T11:30:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Just waiting a moment to see if simon will turn up.
2018-05-24T11:32:33 <sgithens> Bosmon: mornin!
2018-05-24T11:35:53 <sgithens> I don't think simon was planning on attending this one
2018-05-24T11:36:51 <Bosmon> ok
2018-05-24T11:36:59 <Bosmon> Just the 3 of us then?
2018-05-24T11:37:45 <sgithens> I think so yeah
2018-05-24T11:38:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Yup, let's jump on the call.

2018-05-24T12:36:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I submitted a PR for FLUID-6177, it includes the changes from my PR for FLUID-6175/FLUID-6176. Would you prefer to review just the latest PR or rather to review them separately?

2018-05-24T14:38:50 <gmoss> the-t-in-rtf: I've been thinking about how to get partial and layout templates working in the sjrk-story-telling site by using gpii.handlebars without wiring it up to an express instance, i.e. client-side only. I've been reading the docs, and am wondering if you could provide a bit of clarification. :)
2018-05-24T14:39:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I might be able to, but it's only coincidence that I saw this.
2018-05-24T14:39:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I am already off for the day.
2018-05-24T14:39:27 <gmoss> oh, if your day is done, no worries
2018-05-24T14:39:28 <gmoss> it can wait
2018-05-24T14:39:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I have great overlap tomorrow afternoon.
2018-05-24T14:39:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm done at 14:30-15:00 Tuesday and Thursday.
2018-05-24T14:39:45 <the-t-in-rtf> CET
2018-05-24T14:39:48 <gmoss> gotcha!
2018-05-24T14:40:00 <gmoss> perhaps we can have a little call tomorrow to talk about it
2018-05-24T14:40:15 <gmoss> my day is open, so whenever is best for you is fine with me!
2018-05-24T14:40:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I would be very happy to help, I have a lot of ideas about making client-only stuff easier that you can already make use of.
2018-05-24T14:40:24 <gmoss> perfect
2018-05-24T14:40:26 <the-t-in-rtf> 16:00 CET is 10:00 your time?
2018-05-24T14:40:43 <the-t-in-rtf> That seems nicest for both of us.
2018-05-24T14:40:44 <gmoss> it is 11:00 am for me
2018-05-24T14:40:49 <gmoss> but yes that works
2018-05-24T14:40:59 <gmoss> let's talk then. thanks again!
2018-05-24T14:41:15 <the-t-in-rtf> CET is 6 hours from Toronto.
2018-05-24T14:41:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Are you not in Toronto?
2018-05-24T14:41:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I just vaguely group people in my head based on when they show up online.
2018-05-24T14:41:45 <the-t-in-rtf> It's terrible.
2018-05-24T14:42:04 <the-t-in-rtf> ooooh no.
2018-05-24T14:42:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I just looked at my calendar.
2018-05-24T14:42:14 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm at the dentist then.
2018-05-24T14:42:16 <the-t-in-rtf> :||
2018-05-24T14:42:33 <the-t-in-rtf> earlier, say 14:30 CET?
2018-05-24T14:43:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I sent an invite.
2018-05-24T14:43:46 <gmoss> oh, I am, google confused me sorry. sure that time works for me as well :)
2018-05-24T14:43:58 <gmoss> hopefully Alan will be able to join us as well,
2018-05-24T14:45:02 <gmoss> (i'd looked up CET rather than CEST, hence the hour difference, btw)
2018-05-24T14:47:20 <the-t-in-rtf> cool, I added Alan to the invite.
