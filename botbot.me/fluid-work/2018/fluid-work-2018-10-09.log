b'2018-10-09T13:27:56 <cindyli> yes, georgitodorov
2018-10-09T13:30:11 <cindyli> georgitodorov: i can reproduce the issue with QSS using steps described in your JIRA. i also tried another approach by using direct curl command to key in and reset after starting QSS, which seems working fine. looking furthur\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-10-09T13:31:22 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Well, for me it only happened when the "High / Low Contrast" setting had a value different from "regular-contrast"
2018-10-09T13:31:53 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-09T13:35:31 <dandimitrov> jhernandez_: ok. we\xe2\x80\x99ll revert it. I was thinking that probably the jenkins job could simply alter the vagrantfile before runnig `vagrant up`
2018-10-09T13:36:10 <dandimitrov> but nvm that, thanks  jhernandez_ : )

2018-10-09T15:51:30 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - in the meeting with Astea and Gregg yesterday there emerged a couple of fresh feature requests for "reset to all"
2018-10-09T15:52:45 <Bosmon> This one looked like it would be relatively cheap: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3433
2018-10-09T15:54:35 <cindyli> ok, Bosmon. i will start on it once finished https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3437

2018-10-09T15:55:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s really great

2018-10-09T18:12:11 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: FYI, just reproduced the problem with node 10 and the ref module
2018-10-09T18:12:51 <jhernandez_> but I don\'t think it\'s the real issue
2018-10-09T18:13:30 <jhernandez_> you get that problem if you don\'t set the msvs_version in npm
2018-10-09T18:14:10 <jhernandez_> after sorting that out, found this problem https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi/issues/468

2018-10-09T18:16:38 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - you bound to a fork of node-ffi, or what?
2018-10-09T18:17:16 <jhernandez_> apparently, it\'s a version of ffi that hasn\'t been released yet
2018-10-09T18:17:45 <Bosmon> It seems that this crucial project has become unmaintained
2018-10-09T18:17:57 <Bosmon> No core activity for 6 months

2018-10-09T18:36:39 <Bosmon> Well that\'s something

2018-10-09T19:02:07 <jhernandez_> tty later
2018-10-09T19:16:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'ve fixed https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3437 but found it\'s difficult to write a test with the mock platform to reproduce the problem. I\'ve spent much longer on trying various ways in writing a test than fixing it, so seeking your advice
2018-10-09T19:16:48 <cindyli> the problem is with this line https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/UserLogonRequest.js#L64
2018-10-09T19:17:30 <cindyli> a "return" should be added after this line so the /user/reset/login request doesn\'t proceed to line 71 to generate an error response
2018-10-09T19:18:39 <cindyli> in the case that line 71 is ran and successfully triggered onError, noUser will stop logging back in after the reset
2018-10-09T19:19:24 <cindyli> this only occurs when there\'s a long enough reset ongoing such as when high contrast is turned off
2018-10-09T19:19:54 <cindyli> with our mock testing framework, i haven\'t been able to produce a long enough reset
2018-10-09T19:21:03 <cindyli> line 71 does hit, but when onError gets fired, the request component has been destroyed and this onError cannot be successfully registered, and reset will complete successfully
2018-10-09T19:21:26 <cindyli> any ideas?
2018-10-09T19:32:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - I suggest you improve the implementation of this mock async settingsHandler so that it accepts a timeout from its payload, rather than from this hardcoded literal:
2018-10-09T19:32:18 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L262
2018-10-09T19:35:44 <cindyli> ok

2018-10-09T20:02:23 * simonjb has quit
2018-10-09T20:12:04 <sgithens> cindyli: I was wondering how the capture work you\'ve done recently for the qss and gpii-app relates to Kaspers Snapshotter that we cleaned up a bit earlier this year.  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/616  Does it overlap with it all, or replace it, or is it\'s use case completely different?
2018-10-09T20:16:03 * danayo joined the channel
2018-10-09T20:21:43 <cindyli> looks like there\'s overlap at reading current settings
2018-10-09T20:22:03 <cindyli> i\'m not sure if the one i worked on can replace it.
2018-10-09T20:25:09 <cindyli> the goal of snapshotted values in my branch is to provide initial setting values for QSS, so it only reads a hardcoded list of settings that QSS requires. the retrieved values are also not stored into a prefs set as what GPII-228 intended to
2018-10-09T20:26:21 <cindyli> sgithens: ^
2018-10-09T20:29:56 <sgithens> cindyli: Cool thanks for the update!
2018-10-09T20:30:41 <sgithens> Maybe we can revisit the shared functionality after the pilot is ready.  I\'m supposed to work on it a bit more before the end of the year for another prototype

2018-10-09T08:05:31 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I was thinking about the EADDRINUSE error that we discussed yesterday
2018-10-09T08:06:13 <georgitodorov> I am not sure if we need to run the `gpii-universal` and `gpii-windows` tests together with the PSP/QSS tests
2018-10-09T08:06:54 <georgitodorov> I mean, the PSP/QSS code cannot affect the code for those two modules and we should assume that these modules work
2018-10-09T08:09:58 <georgitodorov> The test setup that we have in the tests.js file is something that has been there since the beginning of the project and I think Michelle made it.
2018-10-09T08:12:14 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Do you think it makes sense to remove these tests from the GPII app?
2018-10-09T08:17:26 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-10-09T08:20:30 * yuriy has quit
2018-10-09T08:23:19 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - we don\'t need to run them together, but we do at least need to run the gpii-windows tests from an electron process to make sure that there are not any binding issues
2018-10-09T08:23:32 <Bosmon> BUt it is fine to do this using the approach you see in gpii-windows by invoking it as a separate script
2018-10-09T08:24:37 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: In this case we should provide a relative path to the `gpii-windows` test file?
2018-10-09T08:24:46 <georgitodorov> In the package.json file, I mean
2018-10-09T08:25:06 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - you can provide a small stub script in the package that loads infusion and then executes fluid.require("%gpii-windows/stuff")
2018-10-09T08:28:13 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, I will give it a try

2018-10-09T09:50:20 <the-t-in-rtf> so, I am working on NVDA, and have a question about the name of settings handlers
2018-10-09T09:50:32 <the-t-in-rtf> is there a special meaning to "configure", "configure1", "configure2"?
2018-10-09T09:50:37 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone else.
2018-10-09T09:50:56 <the-t-in-rtf> just seeing if it\'s a harmless convention or if it actually matters that NVDA uses "configs"
2018-10-09T09:51:38 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4081
2018-10-09T09:53:27 * yuriy__ has quit
2018-10-09T09:54:50 <the-t-in-rtf> OH NO.
2018-10-09T09:54:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I figured it out.
2018-10-09T09:55:02 <the-t-in-rtf> someone went with a completely different convention in flat.json
2018-10-09T09:55:09 <the-t-in-rtf> wrapping all "schemas" in "schemas"
2018-10-09T09:55:20 <the-t-in-rtf> where in the solutions registry each setting has its own "schema" entry.
2018-10-09T09:55:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, we can discuss in our afternoon meeting, they don\'t necessarily need to match.
2018-10-09T10:21:18 <georgitodorov> Bosmon or anyone else (perhaps the-t-in-rtf): The current tests of the gpii-app are hanging in CI
2018-10-09T10:21:37 <georgitodorov> Can someone stop this build: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-tests/352/ so that the next can commence?
2018-10-09T10:22:58 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, apparently I can\'t stop it.
2018-10-09T10:36:16 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: No worries, it will time out soon :)

2018-10-09T11:17:41 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: GPII app and gpii-windows tests have finally passed in CI!
2018-10-09T11:18:00 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - that is brilliant!
2018-10-09T11:18:06 <georgitodorov> However, there is one issue. The build is hanging at the code coverage generation step
2018-10-09T11:18:19 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf ^
2018-10-09T11:18:27 <georgitodorov> You can see for yourselves: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/347/console
2018-10-09T11:21:07 <the-t-in-rtf> well.
2018-10-09T11:21:14 <the-t-in-rtf> it hangs after outputting the report.
2018-10-09T11:21:32 <the-t-in-rtf> remind me, does gpii-app do that with a posttest step?
2018-10-09T11:21:38 <the-t-in-rtf> and if so, anything else there?
2018-10-09T11:22:04 <the-t-in-rtf> my guess would be that perhaps cleanup is hanging.
2018-10-09T11:22:15 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: This is the posttest step: "node node_modules/nyc/bin/nyc.js report --temp-directory coverage"
2018-10-09T11:22:34 <georgitodorov> Clean-up happens at pretest
2018-10-09T11:22:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, so I guess we cleanup before the run then.
2018-10-09T11:22:38 <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2018-10-09T11:23:03 <the-t-in-rtf> so, I assume nothing like this happens locally?
2018-10-09T11:23:38 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Perhaps this is the reason: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/QSS1.1/tests.js#L12
2018-10-09T11:23:54 <georgitodorov> Because it is trying to save the report to the filesystem?
2018-10-09T11:24:01 <georgitodorov> No, it doesn\'t happen locally.
2018-10-09T11:24:43 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, it outputs the text output and also attempts to save the report.
2018-10-09T11:24:55 <the-t-in-rtf> even when running the tests in vagrant?
2018-10-09T11:25:12 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: even then
2018-10-09T11:30:01 <the-t-in-rtf> those are awful to troubleshoot.
2018-10-09T11:30:18 <the-t-in-rtf> does it eventually time out, or have we not come that far this time.

2018-10-09T12:39:46 <georgitodorov> Hey, cindyli! I have just filed a JIRA ticket with an issue about the "Reset All to Standard" functionality that I mentioned to Bosmon yesterday
2018-10-09T12:39:54 <georgitodorov> Here is the link to it: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3437
2018-10-09T12:41:09 <cindyli> thanks, georgitodorov, can you attach the defaultSettings.json5 you used in the JIRA?
2018-10-09T12:41:22 <georgitodorov> cindyli: I did not use any
2018-10-09T12:41:45 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Actually, I tried out with and without a defaultSettings.json5 file and the result was the same
2018-10-09T12:41:51 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-09T12:41:54 <georgitodorov> I will edit the description of the ticket
2018-10-09T12:42:09 <cindyli> can i use the feature/QSS1.1 to reproduce the problem?
2018-10-09T12:42:45 <cindyli> the keyout for "snapset_1a" is using /user/reset/snapset_1a endpoint, right?
2018-10-09T12:44:23 <georgitodorov> cindyli: I updated the ticket. You can use that branch. Actually, the key out now performs a "reset all to standard" which in turn keys in the "reset" user
2018-10-09T12:44:57 <georgitodorov> cindyli: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/QSS1.1/src/main/app.js#L522
2018-10-09T12:45:32 <cindyli> right, my mistake, should be /user/reset/login endpoint
2018-10-09T12:45:56 <georgitodorov> cindyli: And one other question
2018-10-09T12:46:36 <georgitodorov> A while ago (when we had the old implementation of the "noUser" functionality) you made the following change to the GPII app: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/QSS1.1/src/main/menu.js#L125
2018-10-09T12:47:09 <georgitodorov> Because the /proximityTriggered endpoint automatically keyed out the current user, there was no longer a need to first key out the user when a new one had to be keyed in
2018-10-09T12:48:08 <georgitodorov> Now if I am keyed in with "snapset_1a", I can\'t directly key in with "snapset_1b" - I have to either perform a key out or a reset all
2018-10-09T12:48:41 <georgitodorov> cindyli: My question is - do you think we can now uncomment the following portion of listeners: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/QSS1.1/src/main/menu.js#L138
2018-10-09T12:50:12 <cindyli> i think so, it will be safer to wait until the keyOut at ling 140 to complete before keying in the next user at line 144 due to possible race condition - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3424
2018-10-09T12:56:27 <stegru> jhernandez_: About your reset all on startup comment, i still think GPII should be closed down cleanly (and restore settings)
2018-10-09T12:58:23 <jhernandez_> stegru: absolutely, but, what if we leave the system in a weird state? i.e.: we leave settings half-applied or the like?
2018-10-09T12:58:57 <stegru> that doesn\'t happen
2018-10-09T12:59:41 <jhernandez_> I remember that we had to apply a nasty workaround to rrestore the high contrast settings on system startup for the previous pilots
2018-10-09T13:00:30 <stegru> yes, but the "reset all" on startup will sort that out
2018-10-09T13:01:43 <jhernandez_> right
2018-10-09T13:02:26 <stegru> when the computer next starts, the login screen will still be in the un-restored state
2018-10-09T13:03:03 <stegru> so things like nvda and the magnifier will still appear
2018-10-09T13:03:13 <stegru> (I presume)
2018-10-09T13:04:29 <stegru> there will be a leak of information about the last user
2018-10-09T13:04:39 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: what do you think? is it worth doing this? we\'re talking about this pr https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/61
2018-10-09T13:05:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez_, yes, for sure
2018-10-09T13:05:16 <stegru> and the next person after me will see that my desktop wallpaper is you
2018-10-09T13:05:47 <Bosmon> Why is this only a pull to AJC3?
2018-10-09T13:05:52 <jhernandez_> stegru: you have "me" in the wallpaper?
2018-10-09T13:06:40 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: I guess it\'s because last week we were targeting the ajc3 branch for the upcoming build
2018-10-09T13:06:51 <Bosmon> ok
2018-10-09T13:06:58 <stegru> master isn\'t very current
2018-10-09T13:07:01 <jhernandez_> and stegru decided to make the pr against ajc3 - not a big deal IMO
2018-10-09T13:07:15 <stegru> what should it be against?
2018-10-09T13:09:29 <cindyli> georgitodorov: to reproduce GPII-3437, shall i start QSS using "npm run dev"?
2018-10-09T13:09:38 <georgitodorov> cindyli: yes
2018-10-09T13:09:41 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-09T13:10:26 <cindyli> georgitodorov: having a problem with keying in which fails at requesting an access token from the cloud. having a look\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-10-09T13:10:48 <georgitodorov> cindyli: oops, I know why this happens
2018-10-09T13:10:54 <georgitodorov> just a sec
2018-10-09T13:12:00 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Substitute this line: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/QSS1.1/configs/app.base.json#L25 with         "%gpii-universal/gpii/configs/gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.all.local"
2018-10-09T13:12:25 <cindyli> i see. thanks, georgitodorov
2018-10-09T13:15:29 <dandimitrov> Hey, jhernandez _ , I noticed that there\'s a step in the gpii-app Vagranfile for creating an installer and I was wondering whether this step is still needed :?
2018-10-09T13:15:42 <dandimitrov> We\xe2\x80\x99ve commented it in order to speed up CI test runtime and it gave a significant boost. Here\'s the change - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/62/commits/1f80e3af866454d3ed692b8b34072c524236d716#diff-23b6f443c01ea2efcb4f36eedfea9089R34
2018-10-09T13:17:11 <jhernandez_> dandimitrov: hey, yes, that line triggers the creation of the installer right after the build process has finished
2018-10-09T13:18:33 <jhernandez_> I guess that you can leave it like that to speed up the ci and restore it back right after the tests are passing again
