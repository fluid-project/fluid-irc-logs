2018-02-06T18:32:50 <cindyli> grrrero: can you remove https://github.com/grrrero/snow-theme/pull/6/files#diff-0d05f8b1c3bcc75fb19914a1e50871d5 as well

2018-02-06T18:33:11 <cindyli> sorry, problem with pasting
2018-02-06T18:33:22 <cindyli> i meant style.styl.orig, grrrero
2018-02-06T18:33:31 <grrrero> Yep I removed that
2018-02-06T18:34:35 <grrrero> Hmm it\'s not in my local but it\'s still showing up
2018-02-06T18:34:36 <grrrero> Will fix that
2018-02-06T18:36:22 <grrrero> Hmm it shouldn\'t show up after this

2018-02-06T19:49:22 <cindyli> grrrero: can you merge SNOW-9 into your master then bring SNOW-10 pull request up to date with the master? The file difference of this pull request is quite confusing at the moment.

2018-02-06T19:57:32 <cindyli> grrrero: how come the changes you made in SNOW-9 still show up here?
2018-02-06T19:58:07 <grrrero> cindyli: I merged SNOW-9 into master and merged with what I had in SNOW-10
2018-02-06T20:00:58 <cindyli> grrrero: i think you should merge the master into your SNOW-10 branch. your recent commit only merges functions.php from the master, not whatever from the master

2018-02-06T22:08:29 <cindyli> :(
2018-02-06T22:08:55 <gtirloni> i\'d try to remove it
2018-02-06T22:09:00 <gtirloni> vagrant box remove inclusivedesign/fedora26
2018-02-06T22:09:20 <gtirloni> it might be complaining about a half-downloaded box (the actual files in ~/.vagrant.d)
2018-02-06T22:09:28 <cindyli> it must be something wrong at my side, same problem for other box like inclusivedesign/centos7
2018-02-06T22:09:48 <gtirloni> you can nuke ~/.vagrant.d directory, if you don\'t mind downloading them again
2018-02-06T22:09:58 <cindyli> trying
2018-02-06T22:12:01 <cindyli> same error :-(
2018-02-06T22:13:18 <gtirloni> ok, one sec, let me see if i can give you some command to reveal the error
2018-02-06T22:14:50 <gtirloni> maybe `vagrant up --debug` will give more details, it shows a bunch of URLs
2018-02-06T22:14:58 <gtirloni> you can try accessing them directly (or through curl/wget)

2018-02-06T15:04:28 <cindyli> amatas, amatas[m] or amatas_, i\'m running step 4 command "rake" in this section (https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/README.md#usual-workflow) to set up my personal dev cloud on AWS. it\'s been stuck with this message for some time:
2018-02-06T15:04:31 <cindyli> Looking up api.dev-cindyli.gpii.net
2018-02-06T15:04:31 <cindyli> no address for api.dev-cindyli.gpii.net
2018-02-06T15:04:31 <cindyli> ...not ready yet. Sleeping 20s (will give up in 400s)...
2018-02-06T15:04:43 <cindyli> is this normal?
2018-02-06T15:04:47 <amatas_> cindyli: yes
2018-02-06T15:04:58 <amatas_> cindyli: it\'s waiting for the DNS records to be ready
2018-02-06T15:05:35 <cindyli> ok. good to know. thanks, amatas_. another question is, what universal code base does this "usual workflow" use to set up the cloud? the universal master?
2018-02-06T15:07:17 <amatas_> cindyli: yes
2018-02-06T15:07:27 <amatas_> cindyli: I mean, universal master
2018-02-06T15:07:30 <cindyli> if I\'d like to use the local change in one of my local branch, do i need to follow what jhernandez did here (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OKgoInyr9unBeWxYvffE_DdcSyfXAF0GHhqfNuU_sD8/edit#) to create an own docker image using the branch code, then push it up and make my dev cloud point to this docker?

2018-02-06T15:35:42 <grrrero> Hi cindyli I\'m not sure how to remove the 8 spaces -- they\'re indented because they\'re nested in if statements and functions
2018-02-06T15:36:07 <grrrero> Re: https://github.com/grrrero/snow-theme/pull/6 ^ cindyli
2018-02-06T15:37:31 <grrrero> 8 or more spaces
2018-02-06T15:38:18 <cindyli> grrrero: the convention of indentations are 4 spaces instead of 8 spaces. Use this line as an example: https://github.com/grrrero/snow-theme/blob/4cd2edbd39f1f387953364b45e57cf3b57af7d97/functions.php#L3, it\'s one level nested and should use 4 spaces instead of 8
2018-02-06T15:39:03 <grrrero> cindyli: Ahhhhhh I see
2018-02-06T15:39:08 <grrrero> Thanks cindyli a lot clearer to me now
2018-02-06T15:39:22 <cindyli> :)
2018-02-06T15:41:30 <cindyli> grrrero: seems it appears 8 spaces on the github interface is because you use tabs rather than spaces for indentations
2018-02-06T15:41:47 <grrrero> I see that now too, ahhh thanks cindyli
2018-02-06T15:41:53 <grrrero> Gonna convert them to spaces

2018-02-06T15:48:09 <amatas_> cindyli: yes, if you want to use your own version of universal you must to create your own universal container, and also publish that container to your docker hub account. Yes, I know, it\'s a bit tricky :(

2018-02-06T16:13:14 <grrrero> gtirloni: Do you have time today to talk about redirecting links on the old SNOW site to the new one on Wordpress?
2018-02-06T16:13:32 <gtirloni> grrrero: yes, just ping me when you\'re free
2018-02-06T16:13:39 <grrrero> gtirloni: Great thank you :)
2018-02-06T16:13:54 <amatas_> cindyli: basically this is the process: https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/push-images/
2018-02-06T16:14:26 <amatas_> let me know if you find any problem
2018-02-06T16:14:35 <cindyli> sure. thanks amatas_

2018-02-06T16:42:51 <cindyli> jhernandez: the process you described in this doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OKgoInyr9unBeWxYvffE_DdcSyfXAF0GHhqfNuU_sD8/edit# about pushing up a docker image is to push up the docker image built by the test:vagrantProduction step, in other words, built by this shell script - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh
2018-02-06T16:43:18 <jhernandez> yup
2018-02-06T16:43:22 <cindyli> but that is correct, this shell script does not contain the step that loads auth data into the couchdb, jhernandez
2018-02-06T16:43:37 <cindyli> but -> if
2018-02-06T16:43:51 * michelled joined the channel
2018-02-06T16:45:02 <cindyli> it only loads the prefs data, not auth data, i mean
2018-02-06T16:45:06 <cindyli> into couchdb
2018-02-06T16:45:19 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-02-06T16:45:31 <jhernandez> no, that script runs when deploying the prefs dataloader container - amatas_ correct me if I\'m wrong
2018-02-06T16:46:35 <cindyli> i agree, jhernandez, it uses the prefs data loader to load prefs data
2018-02-06T16:46:39 <cindyli> but not auth data
2018-02-06T16:46:59 <cindyli> auth data is at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/security/TestOAuth2DataStore.json
2018-02-06T16:47:44 <jhernandez> no, this needs to be "automated" somehow
2018-02-06T16:48:58 <cindyli> ok. very likely we need to automate it now. giving a try...
2018-02-06T16:49:38 <jhernandez> I remember that at some point during a meeting, we agreed on that the prefs-dataloader thing should become a just "dataloader" thing, which will load both the prefs and auth data when deploying the containers
2018-02-06T16:51:59 <cindyli> jhernandez: with my GPII-2630 change, prefs-dataloader will no longer be needed. the change is to load a few json files that each contains gpii keys or prefs safes data etc, instead of converting and loading all individual preferences files in a directory
2018-02-06T16:52:53 <jhernandez> okay, great
2018-02-06T16:54:24 <jhernandez> cindyli: I\'ll be happy to test it when you\'re done with it
2018-02-06T16:54:39 <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez :)

2018-02-06T17:04:33 <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon! Just to report that we\'ve added tests and documentation for the infusion-only approach and merged it with the GPII-2732 branch, so we have a finalised version of the surveys functionality in that PR.
2018-02-06T17:05:30 <dandimitrov> Also can you give us some insight on how to create a page in wiki.gpii.net for the technical evaluation - do we need anything other than a registration?

2018-02-06T17:37:23 <grrrero> Hi cindyli if you have time do you mind leaving a comment on SNOW-9 and SNOW-10 just to say you\'re good with the changes and we can merge?
2018-02-06T17:37:47 <cindyli> ok, grrrero, having a look
2018-02-06T17:37:55 <grrrero> Thanks cindyli!!

2018-02-06T18:06:32 <grrrero> If you are available :)
2018-02-06T18:06:45 <cindyli> sure, grrrero

2018-02-06T18:28:15 <grrrero> After talking to cindyli and jhung we\'ve decided to keep both .styl and .css files because at the moment Wordpress does not have the global capacity to compile stylus files into css and thus we would either need to create a Grunt task (which would be time consuming) or compile it manually locally and then push it and make sure the two files are synchronised.
2018-02-06T18:28:18 <grrrero> See JIRA here where we have a list of options and some documentation on next steps: https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/SNOW/issues/SNOW-14
2018-02-06T18:30:12 <cindyli> thanks, grrrero, can you comment on the pull request with this jira so we know this will be addressed separately
2018-02-06T18:30:53 <grrrero> Yep I added that comment in here cindyli https://github.com/grrrero/snow-theme/pull/6#discussion_r166398818 and https://github.com/grrrero/snow-theme/pull/6#discussion_r166396729
2018-02-06T18:31:08 <cindyli> thanks, grrrero
2018-02-06T18:31:23 <grrrero> Other than that is there anything else I may have forgotten to address in these PRs cindyli ?
2018-02-06T18:31:32 <cindyli> checking..
2018-02-06T18:31:54 <cindyli> these 2 comments are identical, probably remove one of them, grrrero?
2018-02-06T18:32:00 <grrrero> Oh ok!
