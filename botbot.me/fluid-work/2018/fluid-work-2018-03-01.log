b"2018-03-01T20:22:10 <cindyli> thanks for the good work, gtirloni
2018-03-01T20:22:15 <amatas> np, it's a good work
2018-03-01T20:22:34 <gtirloni> i find it amazing that jenkins, in the build description where we added a link to the PR, adds a unicode zero width char (U+200B) ... if you copy and paste that into a browser, it doesn't consider it a URL

b'2018-03-01T16:28:16 <Bosmon> No, I wouldn\'t
2018-03-01T16:28:21 <Bosmon> But we should understand why it fails

2018-03-01T16:34:47 <cindyli> amatas: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/586
2018-03-01T16:35:09 <mrtyler> hello
2018-03-01T16:38:51 <amatas> perhaps the couchdb container took too much time to spawn
2018-03-01T16:39:07 <Bosmon> I imagine it couldn\'t have taken 30 seconds
2018-03-01T16:39:22 <mrtyler> i think you have a bad imagination ;)
2018-03-01T16:39:28 <Bosmon> From what I can guess, the issue is that it failed just once with this error condition, but that curl wasn\'t prepared to retry after that
2018-03-01T16:39:53 <mrtyler> if the machine is loaded, couchdb startup could have been delayed
2018-03-01T16:40:16 <mrtyler> hard to say without system metrics
2018-03-01T16:40:23 <Bosmon> yes
2018-03-01T16:40:34 <Bosmon> I guess we can just try again and see how often it happens
2018-03-01T16:40:58 <amatas> the host is slight busy
2018-03-01T16:42:01 <mrtyler> the curl on h5 is really really old: curl 7.29.0
2018-03-01T16:43:01 <mrtyler> which doesn\'t support --retry-connrefused. but it doesn\'t complain about that so maybe i\'m looking at the wrong curl
2018-03-01T16:43:05 <amatas> mrtyler: right, but the curl that throws the error is inside a Vagrant box
2018-03-01T16:43:19 <mrtyler> ah
2018-03-01T16:43:56 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-03-01T16:44:40 <amatas> anyway I can not see this kind of messages: "Warning: Transient problem: connection refused Will retry in 1 seconds. 25 retries left."
2018-03-01T16:45:18 <Bosmon> Well whoop de doo it has failed again :)
2018-03-01T16:45:23 <amatas> which the curl 7.58.0 throws
2018-03-01T16:45:48 <cindyli> noooo.....
2018-03-01T16:45:52 <Bosmon> And with exactly the same cause
2018-03-01T16:45:59 <cindyli> exactly
2018-03-01T16:46:29 <mrtyler> amatas: i agree that --retry-connrefused should be handling this case and printing an error like you pasted
2018-03-01T16:47:08 <amatas> perhaps it\'s time to merge this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/565
2018-03-01T16:47:49 <mrtyler> we could try adding --trace-ascii to debug further, as suggested here: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/1016
2018-03-01T16:50:21 <mrtyler> build 699 was also affected: https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-production-tests/699/console
2018-03-01T16:50:28 <mrtyler> maybe upstream couchdb changed something?
2018-03-01T16:50:48 <mrtyler> can someone make this build step run successfully locally?
2018-03-01T16:52:06 <mrtyler> between the last successfull build (698) and the first failed build (699) the sleep duration changed from 10 to 5!
2018-03-01T16:52:08 <amatas> mrtyler: I checking out the Cindy\'s PR and see how it works on my pc
2018-03-01T16:52:18 <mrtyler> what\'s up with that?
2018-03-01T16:52:57 <amatas> I\'d like to see the options of the curl of the Fedora26

2018-03-01T16:54:01 <amatas> Gio sent this PR https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/565 on Nov fixing the version of the Fedora and the sleep duration of the curl command
2018-03-01T16:59:11 <cindyli> amatas, mrtyler, Gio is sick and away. when he\'s back, if he can update this pull request with the latest master (so we can make sure it works with the latest code), i can help to merge it
2018-03-01T16:59:23 <cindyli> i will ping him when he\'s back
2018-03-01T17:03:56 <amatas> I can confirm that the curl command in the script doesn\'t wait the delay, it fails inmediately
2018-03-01T17:04:22 <mrtyler> amatas: i.e. the behavior is the same with and without --retry-connrefused ?
2018-03-01T17:05:37 <amatas> it\'s odd, because if I exec the same command line at the shell (out of the script) it works as expected
2018-03-01T17:09:52 <amatas> mrtyler: same behavior without --retry-connrefused . in fact the error is "connection reset by peer"
2018-03-01T17:10:11 <mrtyler> that seems wrong
2018-03-01T17:11:05 <mrtyler> maybe reset by peer != connection refused ?
2018-03-01T17:12:10 <amatas> connection refused can be that the port is closed
2018-03-01T17:12:33 <amatas> reset by peer , the connection is made, but it\'s closed inmediately
2018-03-01T17:13:17 <mrtyler> right
2018-03-01T17:13:35 <mrtyler> but idk why --retry wouldn\'t work for that case
2018-03-01T17:14:02 <mrtyler> (i\'m also not sure why connection refused is a "special" failure case with its own --retry-connrefused command line option)
2018-03-01T17:22:28 * yuriy joined the channel
2018-03-01T17:24:04 <amatas> wget --retry-connrefused --waitretry=1 --read-timeout=5 --timeout=15 -t 42 http://localhost:5984
2018-03-01T17:24:08 <amatas> works better than curl

2018-03-01T17:27:49 <mrtyler> cindyli: separate topic: i have a few more thoughts about running "production" tests against a kubernetes cluster
2018-03-01T17:28:09 <cindyli> yay!
2018-03-01T17:28:13 <mrtyler> i think the first step, which you could start on when you\'re ready, is to be able to run the production tests using a gpii-universal docker container
2018-03-01T17:29:03 <mrtyler> we can chat more about this, or i can sit and pair with you, sometime today or tomorrow if you like
2018-03-01T17:30:18 <cindyli> mrtyler: i should be ready in 10 minutes, will ping you
2018-03-01T17:30:24 <mrtyler> ok
2018-03-01T17:30:30 <amatas> mrtyler, cindyli: I\'m also interested on that topic, perhaps i can join the conversation if you don\'t mind
2018-03-01T17:30:40 <mrtyler> wfm alfredo :)
2018-03-01T17:30:47 <cindyli> that\'s great
2018-03-01T17:31:27 <amatas> cindyli: try to change the curl command of the script scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh by this wget command: wget --retry-connrefused --waitretry=1 --read-timeout=20 --timeout=15 -t 30 http://localhost:$COUCHDB_PORT
2018-03-01T17:31:50 <cindyli> ok
2018-03-01T17:31:56 <mrtyler> i think it\'s ok to consider changing to wget, but personally i\'d be more interested in what changed that caused this system to break in the last day
2018-03-01T17:32:09 <mrtyler> since it worked up until yesterday, then suddenly stopped working
2018-03-01T17:32:21 <mrtyler> to me that is more worrisome than the fact that curl seems to be dumb about handling connection resets
2018-03-01T17:33:28 <amatas> I\'d say that the couchdb container took more than 5 sec the last time to deploy
2018-03-01T17:33:42 <amatas> perhaps because the host was more busy than before
2018-03-01T17:33:55 <mrtyler> fwiw upstream couchdb hasn\'t changed in 12 days, so i don\'t think upstream is to blame
2018-03-01T17:34:02 <amatas> in fact, if the wget command works, we can get rid of the "sleep" command
2018-03-01T17:34:20 <amatas> I\'m blaming the h-0005
2018-03-01T17:34:36 <mrtyler> do you have any data to support that guess?
2018-03-01T17:34:53 <amatas> mm, no
2018-03-01T17:34:56 <amatas> BUT
2018-03-01T17:35:15 <amatas> I\'ve run the same script in my pc and it always fails
2018-03-01T17:35:20 <amatas> connection reset by peer
2018-03-01T17:35:30 <mrtyler> that doesn\'t sound like it\'s caused by resource contention, then
2018-03-01T17:35:43 <amatas> so I\'d ask why that script has been working until now
2018-03-01T17:35:52 <mrtyler> yes, me too
2018-03-01T17:37:21 <amatas> my guessing is that the couchdb application took too much time to be ready. I mean the "connection reset by peer" can mean that the couchdb had the port opened, but it wasn\'t able to handle any connection

2018-03-01T17:47:23 <amatas> until we have metrics of h-0005 I\'d say that the entropy of the universe is playing with us

2018-03-01T17:49:29 <mrtyler> that\'s some extreme entropy! :)

2018-03-01T14:21:55 <Bosmon> alanharnum, Justin_o - we had a kind of "pre-meeting" about I18N this afternoon that I wanted to share with you the notes of:
2018-03-01T14:22:13 <Bosmon> https://pad.gpii.net/p/i18n-meetings-6294n3p
2018-03-01T14:23:19 * jhung joined the channel
2018-03-01T14:26:20 <Justin_o> alanharnum: is there a JIRA for the RTL uio work that you\'ve been doing?
2018-03-01T14:26:25 <alanharnum> Thanks Bosmon, having a look now
2018-03-01T14:27:53 <alanharnum> Justin_o: these two JIRAs are related to that work: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6197 / https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6198
2018-03-01T14:28:17 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks :)
2018-03-01T14:28:36 <alanharnum> Justin_o: there\'s also this PR: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/850

2018-03-01T15:09:00 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - does 9am EST work for you to re-meet about I18N?
2018-03-01T15:09:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: as a bonus to our meeting today, you\'ve pointed me at a bug in UIO related to focus for the panels in the mobile view
2018-03-01T15:09:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool, what triggers the bug?
2018-03-01T15:09:48 <Justin_o> well.. we don\'t adjust focus at all :(
2018-03-01T15:10:09 <Justin_o> so if you reload, it shows the correct panel but focus will actually still move to the first one
2018-03-01T15:10:34 <Justin_o> it seems this is also a problem if you use the mouse to click the arrows and then switch to using the keyboard
2018-03-01T15:10:52 <Justin_o> i\'m going to write up a JIRA for this
2018-03-01T15:11:24 <Bosmon> Ok cool
2018-03-01T15:11:45 <Bosmon> Might be somewhat tough to write a test case for : P
2018-03-01T15:12:06 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-03-01T15:12:29 <Justin_o> sadly yes... simulating tab navigation is pretty much impossible.. maybe after we have the web driver stuff we could do that

2018-03-01T15:51:00 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2018-03-01T15:52:56 <Justin_o> avtar: do you know how long it takes for cache fly to update. I reuploaded a file.. how long will it take to show the new version?
2018-03-01T15:54:16 <avtar> Justin_o: i\'m not sure :/
2018-03-01T15:54:18 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - great
2018-03-01T15:54:31 <Bosmon> Remind me how you had been getting on with the webdriver stuff?
2018-03-01T15:55:01 <Justin_o> avtar: no worries.. i\'ll just wait.. i don\'t have to do anything to trigger it to reload do i?

2018-03-01T15:58:20 <avtar> i\'m assuming it\'s a matter of time after uploading as bits get propagated
2018-03-01T15:58:42 <avtar> unfortunately their knowledge base url leads to a 404
2018-03-01T15:59:28 <Justin_o> avtar: thanks, looks like it\'s taken effect now
2018-03-01T15:59:37 <avtar> there\'s this approach if you don\'t see it being updated https://cachefly.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215068746-Purging-Files

2018-03-01T16:10:25 <Justin_o> avtar: thanks for the info on that.. good to know there is a way to clean things out
2018-03-01T16:12:41 <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good! I am indeed interested, thanks for pointing it out

2018-03-01T16:21:51 <Bosmon> cindyli - what do you think about this failure of the production config tests?
2018-03-01T16:21:53 <Bosmon> https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-production-tests/700/console
2018-03-01T16:23:07 <cindyli> Bosmon: it fails at running "curl": curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
2018-03-01T16:23:15 <Bosmon> yes
2018-03-01T16:23:31 <cindyli> i see, to couchdb
2018-03-01T16:23:52 <cindyli> at http://localhost:5984/
2018-03-01T16:24:00 <cindyli> i guess the couchdb is not up running yet
2018-03-01T16:24:38 <Bosmon> But seemingly it retries for 30 seconds?
2018-03-01T16:24:48 <cindyli> which pull request is this?
2018-03-01T16:25:28 <cindyli> my pull request, haha
2018-03-01T16:25:35 <Bosmon> Yes yours :)
2018-03-01T16:26:08 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-03-01T16:26:12 <cindyli> re-running the CI
2018-03-01T16:27:15 <cindyli> don\'t expect the changes in this pull request would affect the production config tests
