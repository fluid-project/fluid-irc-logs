2018-04-10T08:29:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there anyone around who\'s familiar with the wrapper script used to run the gpii-app tests?
2018-04-10T08:29:45 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/master/package.json#L32
2018-04-10T08:30:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to run the tests from a directory containing instrumented source code, and can\'t ever get the tests to complete.
2018-04-10T08:30:55 <the-t-in-rtf> It doesn\'t matter if I run the tests without the wrapper or use the wrapper to run tests from another path, neither ever completes.
2018-04-10T08:31:13 <the-t-in-rtf> You can see my work in progress here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/44

2018-04-10T09:15:14 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Hi, Tony. We will take a look at your branch. However, we are not familiar with the provisioning/Tests.ps1 powershell script that is used when running tests. Perhaps jhernandez can give you more details on this.
2018-04-10T09:15:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, I plan to bring it up in the meeting tonight.
2018-04-10T09:19:16 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: What meeting are you referring to?
2018-04-10T09:19:30 <the-t-in-rtf> tonight\'s architecture meeting.
2018-04-10T09:19:53 <the-t-in-rtf> 18:00 CET every Wednesday.
2018-04-10T09:22:25 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I think this meeting is tomorrow :) Today is Tuesday
2018-04-10T09:22:33 <the-t-in-rtf> OH MY GOD.
2018-04-10T09:22:40 <the-t-in-rtf> You\'re right!
2018-04-10T09:22:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I have another whole DAY.
2018-04-10T09:24:06 <the-t-in-rtf> What will I do with the time?  Probably look for used synthesizers online...
2018-04-10T09:39:29 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I am getting the following error when trying to run the coverage script:  Error saving coverage data:{
2018-04-10T09:39:29 <georgitodorov> "errno": -4058,
2018-04-10T09:39:29 <georgitodorov> "code": "ENOENT",
2018-04-10T09:39:29 <georgitodorov> "syscall": "open",
2018-04-10T09:39:29 <georgitodorov> "path": "C:\\\\work\\\\repos\\\\the-t-in-rtf\\\\gpii-app\\\\instrumented\\\\coverage\\\\coverage-tests-2018-04-10T09:35:52.643Z.json"
2018-04-10T09:39:31 <georgitodorov> }
2018-04-10T09:39:44 <the-t-in-rtf> OH WOW.
2018-04-10T09:40:05 <the-t-in-rtf> That means the tests actually complete for you and all you\'re missing is the "coverage" directory in the instrumented subdir.
2018-04-10T09:40:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess you\'re running on Windows without a VM?
2018-04-10T09:40:21 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: That\'s correct
2018-04-10T09:41:01 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: When does this directory get created?
2018-04-10T09:41:08 <the-t-in-rtf> never.
2018-04-10T09:41:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m fixing that now.
2018-04-10T09:41:13 <georgitodorov> I tried creating it manually but it got deleted next time
2018-04-10T09:41:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, it will be.
2018-04-10T09:41:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Just a moment.
2018-04-10T09:41:30 <georgitodorov> Okay, thanks
2018-04-10T09:41:42 <the-t-in-rtf> This is a case where I can\'t really use fluid.module.resolvePath, as it resolves relative to the instrumented dir.
2018-04-10T09:43:32 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, if you can git pull, you\'ll get a copy of the test script that will break out of the instrumented subdir and save its work to the right directory.
2018-04-10T09:43:59 <the-t-in-rtf> If you see anything higher than 0% coverage, then my approach is working.
2018-04-10T09:44:09 <the-t-in-rtf> well, sorry, not 0%, but very low.
2018-04-10T09:44:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, let me know, I\'d love to see the report if it succeeds.
2018-04-10T09:48:04 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I am getting the same error but this time the file path is different: "path": "C:\\\\work\\\\repos\\\\the-t-in-rtf\\\\coverage\\\\coverage-tests-2018-04-10T09:47:36.484Z.json"
2018-04-10T09:48:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Can you create that directory?
2018-04-10T09:49:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the whole instrumented dir is blown away on each run, but that location should persist.
2018-04-10T09:49:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll add a step to ensure it exists, but you shouldn\'t need to wait if you just create it.
2018-04-10T09:49:35 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Oh, I created it in the gpii-app folder. Now I see it is one level higher
2018-04-10T09:50:23 <the-t-in-rtf> you  mean it\'s higher than the root of the repo?
2018-04-10T09:51:03 <the-t-in-rtf> or that it\'s in the root of the repo?
2018-04-10T09:52:09 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: It is not in the root of the repo. It is in the parent directory of the gpii-app folder
2018-04-10T09:52:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Ooops.
2018-04-10T09:52:22 <georgitodorov> I created the coverage folder there and still no luck
2018-04-10T09:52:27 <georgitodorov> I am getting the same error
2018-04-10T09:53:05 <the-t-in-rtf> try another git pull.
2018-04-10T09:53:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I just fixed the path again.
2018-04-10T09:53:21 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Okay
2018-04-10T09:53:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry for the back and forth, but I can\'t get this far on my Vagrant VM.
2018-04-10T09:53:26 <the-t-in-rtf> And thanks again.
2018-04-10T09:53:39 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: No worries :)
2018-04-10T09:57:42 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I am still getting the ENOENT error
2018-04-10T09:58:26 <the-t-in-rtf> What\'s the path now?
2018-04-10T09:58:28 <georgitodorov> I commented out the require of logging.js because of an error there (gpii.settingsDir is not a function) but I don\'t believe these two issues are related
2018-04-10T09:58:53 <georgitodorov> The path is correct, I think - gpii-app\\\\coverage\\\\coverage-tests-2018-04-10T09:57:10.974Z.json
2018-04-10T10:01:10 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I am going out for a quick lunch and we can continue the debugging after that (on a skype call perhaps with screen sharing)
2018-04-10T10:01:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks!
2018-04-10T10:01:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll be going to lunch at noon, but I\'ll look for you.
2018-04-10T10:01:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I mean at one, i.e.in an hour.
2018-04-10T10:02:13 <the-t-in-rtf> When you get back, I updated the branch to save relative to the instrumented test fixture.

2018-04-10T10:29:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Same path?
2018-04-10T10:30:13 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: yes
2018-04-10T10:31:16 <the-t-in-rtf> so odd.
2018-04-10T10:32:07 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: It\'s weird that I get an ENOENT error when actually the coverage tools are trying to create a file
2018-04-10T10:32:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume it\'s complaining about the enclosing directory not existing.
2018-04-10T10:32:47 <georgitodorov> Can I rename the output json not to include the timestamp and then create it manually in the coverage folder to see if this would help?
2018-04-10T10:33:05 <the-t-in-rtf> you could, or save it to the current dir.
2018-04-10T10:33:20 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. make the path the filename for now and manually copy it up.
2018-04-10T10:33:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll figure out the rest once I get a working environment.
2018-04-10T10:33:41 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-04-10T10:34:01 <the-t-in-rtf> You would then run "npm run postcoverage" once you\'ve copied the file to the coverage directory in the root of the repo.
2018-04-10T10:39:15 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I have some good news :)
2018-04-10T10:39:59 <georgitodorov> I removed the date from the name of the generated json file, created it manually and afterwards the `npm run coverage` succeeded
2018-04-10T10:40:13 <georgitodorov> I moved the file to the coverage folder and got the following results:
