2018-05-21T17:15:21 <simonjb> sgithens, the-t-in-rtf: do we have confirmation of meeting tomorrow? I don\'t want to get up early if the meeting isn\'t happening :)

2018-05-21T17:49:08 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a holiday here, so it\'s pure coincidence I even saw this.
2018-05-21T17:49:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, AFAIK we\'re waiting to hear from @Bosmon.
2018-05-21T17:49:46 <Bosmon> Is it ok with sgithens?
2018-05-21T17:49:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.
2018-05-21T17:50:19 <the-t-in-rtf> He implied that it was a good time for him if it was OK with you and @Bosmon.
2018-05-21T17:50:43 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, he explicitly said it was fine in the previous note, just working through the email.
2018-05-21T17:51:49 <Bosmon> OK sure, let\'s do it
2018-05-21T17:52:11 <Bosmon> Where is this email?
2018-05-21T17:52:53 <the-t-in-rtf> your ponder and rtf accounts.
2018-05-21T17:53:42 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-05-21T17:54:33 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, I realised I have to be more specific
2018-05-21T17:54:40 <the-t-in-rtf> your ponder@googlemail account.
2018-05-21T17:54:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, glad it\'s happening, thanks in advance for getting up early, @simonjb and
2018-05-21T17:55:01 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens
2018-05-21T17:58:13 * kasparnet has quit
2018-05-21T17:58:34 <simonjb> ok, thanks the-t-in-rtf
2018-05-21T17:59:01 <simonjb> looks like we\'re are on :)
2018-05-21T17:59:31 <simonjb> err, obviously only one "are" needed
2018-05-21T18:02:31 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-05-21T18:05:08 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s fine, most people accept "atm machine" and the like these days.
2018-05-21T18:05:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Isn\'t it also a holiday there?
2018-05-21T18:05:24 <the-t-in-rtf> or was it one of the optional ones?
2018-05-21T18:08:45 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: yeah, it\'s a holiday here but I had 2 migraines last week and missed a bunch of work and wanted to work some today to catch up on some things
2018-05-21T18:09:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Good luck catching up and see you tomorrow.
