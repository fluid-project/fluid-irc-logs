2018-05-30T15:49:26 <gmoss> fluid-everyone: I missed standup as I was dodging poor drivers on the highway for longer than expected, so here\'s my update: yesterday we had the design crit(s), planning meeting, and then I worked on trying to reproduce some of the issues michelled identified while in Colombia (SJRK-98, SJRK-99), and I filed SJRK-100 as it occurred to me. Today I plan to continue in this vein, and later we have the community meeting

2018-05-30T15:58:00 <gmoss> thanks the-t-in-rtf for putting together the work for GPII-3085 so quickly! I\'m looking forward to taking advantage of it :)
2018-05-30T15:58:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Great.  I\'d love for someone to try it/give feedback.
2018-05-30T15:58:33 <gmoss> I will be glad to
2018-05-30T15:59:03 <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanks in advance.

2018-05-30T17:15:30 <Bosmon> gtirloni, the-t-in-rtf - I\'m a bit confused about "headless mode"
2018-05-30T17:15:46 <Bosmon> Surely our tests which exercise control and window focus couldn\'t pass in it?
2018-05-30T17:16:26 <Bosmon> Or does the browser somehow simulate the exterior environment from which user events arrive
2018-05-30T17:36:34 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-05-30T17:40:26 <gtirloni> i don\'t think headless does that, it seems to simply not render the visible widgets... it *seems* that area (external input/manipulation) would be covered by WebDriver (geckodriver, for instance)
2018-05-30T17:40:26 <gtirloni> https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/master/widget/headless/HeadlessWidget.cpp#L227
2018-05-30T17:46:06 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, my guess would be that headless mode is largely equivalent to how people used to run visual tests in vnc.

2018-05-30T17:46:43 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. it\'s still drawing everything in some virtual state.
2018-05-30T17:47:40 <the-t-in-rtf> which is visible to whatever means the test harness has of controlling the browser.
2018-05-30T17:48:01 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the harness can ask about focus and the detached headless state can answer sensibly.
2018-05-30T17:51:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe our tests simulate activity by triggering click, keypress, etc. events, so it doesn\'t surprise me at all that they\'d work in a headless environment.

2018-05-30T18:21:21 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf Bosmon : Apologies again for missing on Tuesday.  Do you think we need to schedule another before Toronto, or just continue when we get there in person?
2018-05-30T18:25:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m not particularly fussed about having an actual meeting as long as there is enough clearly agreed work for the end of next week.
2018-05-30T18:26:05 <the-t-in-rtf> So, for example, you could try out the i18n work in this pull and comment:

2018-05-30T18:26:23 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens ^^^
2018-05-30T18:26:53 <the-t-in-rtf> The more involved discussions I think are good for Toronto.
2018-05-30T18:27:19 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf Awesome, I\'ll take a look at that, and get back with comments

2018-05-30T18:28:17 <the-t-in-rtf> The latest work follows the "messages as model variable" pattern, and demonstrates approaches to handling that on both the client and server side.

2018-05-30T19:40:51 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: I need to change some webhook settings in fluid-project repos and was wondering if I could be given admin access for that (or if anyone wants to pair with me whenever I need to change that today and in the next few weeks)

2018-05-30T19:46:30 <gtirloni> I don\'t actually want push access at all, but it seems it\'s read -> read+write -> read+write+admin in GitHub... the wiki only mentions push access (https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Maintainers)

2018-05-30T22:28:22 <Bosmon> Something to do with a logger handler in ansible ....
