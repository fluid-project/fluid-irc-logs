b'2018-08-08T18:52:46 <stegru> yes, Bosmon
2018-08-08T18:54:02 <stegru> but also, I have to remove UIO+ from the installed solutions to get high-contrast to work
2018-08-08T18:55:06 <stegru> although judging by some logs I\'ve seen, this isn\'t needed
2018-08-08T18:55:09 <stegru> any ideas on that, jhernandez? is there any change to the configs you make before making the installer?

2018-08-08T19:09:38 <jhernandez> stegru: not entirely sure on whether we need this after the changes from both ASTEA and Cindy
2018-08-08T19:09:44 <jhernandez> maybe we just don\'t need it
2018-08-08T19:10:25 <jhernandez> and no, right now the code of the installer has come from the code that is right now at gpii-app/feds-audit
2018-08-08T19:10:33 <stegru> ok
2018-08-08T19:10:39 <stegru> it must be me

2018-08-08T20:32:26 <sgithens> Bosmon jhernandez stegru I\'m about to install the audit build soon, but I\'m wondering if there is a startup option for which preferences server it reads from, or if I should drill down into the install and edit the json config.  I want to try and have it read/write to my AWS dev cluster, and then edit/read the QSS changes in the PPT
2018-08-08T20:33:22 <stegru> I know nothing about that area

2018-08-08T22:41:38 <jhernandez> there\'s nothing in place yet for that
2018-08-08T22:41:52 <sgithens> jhernandez: No worries, I know you\'re deep in building exe\'s :)
2018-08-08T22:41:53 <jhernandez> BUT
2018-08-08T22:42:12 <jhernandez> you can do it easily
2018-08-08T22:42:55 <jhernandez> first, you need to indicate in gpii-app the config of universal you want to use
2018-08-08T22:48:02 <jhernandez> you need to replace the config here (https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/feds-audit/configs/app.base.json#L25) with "gpii.config.untrusted.development.json5"
2018-08-08T22:48:32 <jhernandez> and then, indicate the url to the cloud that you want to use
2018-08-08T22:52:18 <jhernandez> here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.config.untrusted.base.json5#L15
2018-08-08T22:52:57 <jhernandez> as you can see, it will also catch the url if you set the GPII_CLOUD_URL en variable
2018-08-08T22:55:08 <jhernandez> but don\'t think will b the case for electron, and I guess we would need to include the value from distributeOptions block in the gpii-app config
2018-08-08T22:56:02 <jhernandez> this is one of the things that is yet to be done
2018-08-08T22:57:44 <jhernandez> done in code, since by the time I tested it was by monkey patching the values directly
2018-08-08T22:57:47 <sgithens> jhernandez: Awesome thanks!  I will give it a try

2018-08-08T07:16:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Almost all of our JSDoc checks come in by way of eslint\'s valid-jsdoc rule, btw.
2018-08-08T07:17:08 <the-t-in-rtf> So look at whatever version of ESLint we\'re using and that should give you an idea.

2018-08-08T13:27:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m running into yet another issue with captions... so the problem here is that it doesn\'t seem like you can bind multiple instances of the YT.Player to a single video
2018-08-08T13:27:36 <Justin_o> what i\'m seeing is that some events and functions just don\'t work
2018-08-08T13:28:17 <Justin_o> when i try to run UIO+ with the captions enactor on a page, the example from infusion, that has the video bound to a YT.Player.. the UIO+ version wins and the one on the page is broken
2018-08-08T13:30:33 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: Fluid CI will be down for 30-90min due to maintenance
2018-08-08T13:30:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, that seems reasonable
2018-08-08T13:31:16 <Bosmon> So we will need to arrange for everything to multiplex via a single one
2018-08-08T13:32:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it means that if you visit some other page on the web that also uses the YouTube iframe api, it will break as well.
2018-08-08T13:32:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well that will have to be an issue reported to the developers of the API
2018-08-08T13:32:51 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t look as if we could do anything about 3rd party instances of this problem
2018-08-08T13:33:01 <Bosmon> But we can at least solve our own one
2018-08-08T13:33:17 <Justin_o> also turning over in my mind now if there is a design issue on our end.. in that what does "off" mean for captions. Does it mean turn captions off, or don\'t do anything?
2018-08-08T13:33:43 <Bosmon> I imagine it means "off" : P
2018-08-08T13:33:58 <Bosmon> Don\'t do anything means there is no setting
2018-08-08T13:35:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s how it\'s implemented, but it means it will always be running. so it will, at least for now, always be breaking other instances of the YT.Player even if someone just didn\'t care about the setting
2018-08-08T13:35:49 <Justin_o> anyways, i\'m looking into how to report the issue to them.
2018-08-08T13:36:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, the value of the setting will ultimately be sourced from the user\'s preferences, right?
2018-08-08T13:36:17 <Bosmon> So I\'m imagining that if no value is found in the preferences, the enactor will do nothing
2018-08-08T13:36:53 <Bosmon> But yes, we could think of making the enactor lazily loaded
2018-08-08T13:37:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well no the enactors always do something
2018-08-08T13:37:17 <Justin_o> because it has a default value
2018-08-08T13:37:43 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-08-08T13:37:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, we should certainly revisit that
2018-08-08T13:37:49 * jhernandez has quit
2018-08-08T13:37:55 <Bosmon> Since it is an aspect in which enactors are inconsistent with settings handlers
2018-08-08T13:38:01 * jhernandez joined the channel
2018-08-08T13:38:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - we already arranged for UIO itself to be lazily loaded as a courtesy to some users
2018-08-08T13:38:38 <Bosmon> And I think doing the same for expensive or disruptive enactors would be appropriate as well
2018-08-08T13:39:07 <jhernandez> stegru: buenos dias, will you be available in 30 mins or so to go through the issues that Gregg reported?
2018-08-08T13:39:22 <stegru> jhernandez: aye
2018-08-08T13:39:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that could result in more flickering for some enactors.. well anything that changes the visuals i\'d think
2018-08-08T13:40:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - given they would only change visual state when a setting changed, I think that the flickering would be acceptable
2018-08-08T13:40:57 <jhernandez> stegru: cool, thanks :)
2018-08-08T13:41:06 <Bosmon> That is, the user would have had to make some positive action in order to cause the enactor to get loaded, by changing a setting from its default value
2018-08-08T13:41:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: true, i guess it depends on how long that delay is.. and what happens on page load, reload when the setting is present
2018-08-08T13:41:51 <stegru> just pull my chain when you want me, jhernandez
2018-08-08T13:42:03 <Justin_o> the immediate change when adjusting the setting initially would likely be okay.. unless it was really slow, which i can\'t see happening
2018-08-08T13:42:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, we would bypass the lazy load on startup if there already was a setting value, and revert to our current behaviour
2018-08-08T13:42:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm. okay.. it seems like a large change.. partly because the prefs framework gets it\'s settings after init all the time, because it has to load in from the store
2018-08-08T13:43:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, we\'ll need to reassess the prefs framework in a wider way
2018-08-08T13:43:18 <Bosmon> But it was due for that anyway
2018-08-08T13:43:30 <Bosmon> I think our current handling of default settings has been very kludgy for a while
2018-08-08T13:43:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i agree.. it could do with an overhaul
2018-08-08T13:44:10 <Justin_o> but probably not in time for the aug demo
2018-08-08T13:44:17 <Bosmon> No, not in time for that :)
2018-08-08T13:44:40 <Bosmon> But we can certainly arrange for the Aug demo not to visit any sites which are already users of the YT iframe API : P
2018-08-08T13:45:36 <Justin_o> okay, so your suggestion then is to press on as is and don\'t worry about this breakage for now?
2018-08-08T13:45:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2018-08-08T13:45:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2018-08-08T13:45:46 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2018-08-08T13:45:59 <Bosmon> The demo will be scripted, and targetted at things we have already previously established will work
2018-08-08T13:46:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also i\'m still stuck on the testem stuff. Don\'t understand it enough to have any reasonable guess as to why it still isn\'t working
2018-08-08T13:46:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s good..
2018-08-08T13:46:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can\'t say I have a deep understanding of it either
2018-08-08T13:47:10 <Bosmon> We will have to wait for assistance from the-t-in-rtf, and hopefully this can also feed into further documentation to help people avoid the problem

2018-08-08T16:29:44 <jhernandez> https://pastebin.com/c4ffysd1
2018-08-08T16:29:53 <stegru> great
2018-08-08T16:30:06 <jhernandez> Failure to read settings for handler gpii.windows.spiSettingsHandler as written after 12 retries
2018-08-08T16:32:29 <stegru> I think that\'s now fixed, with my updates to GPII-3220
2018-08-08T16:33:11 <stegru> oh Bosmon, I think i\'ve also fixed some high-contrast problem... but I don\'t know if it\'s related to what you\'ve been talking about
2018-08-08T16:33:33 <stegru> but it\'s where the QSS only sets highContrastTheme, and not highContrast/enable
2018-08-08T16:35:30 <jhernandez> stegru: oh, great!!
2018-08-08T16:35:55 <jhernandez> and yes, good point
2018-08-08T16:36:31 <jhernandez> it would be great if you can check stegru\'s changes on the highContrast stuff he just mentioned
2018-08-08T16:37:15 <jhernandez> just to be sure that it doesn\'t overlaps with anything either from gpii-app or the improvementss that Cindy need to do in the noUser branch
2018-08-08T16:38:39 <jhernandez> I think the interesting bits are the changes on the transformation that stegru made here, https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/638/files#diff-cb7e20a6c5ff97630ea4518024a845b2R1956
2018-08-08T16:38:44 <jhernandez> stegru: am I right?
2018-08-08T16:39:24 <stegru> yes
2018-08-08T16:40:04 <stegru> it infers the value of highContrast/enabled from the value of highContrastTheme
2018-08-08T16:54:53 <Bosmon> stegru - yes, it is part of what Astea reported
2018-08-08T16:55:01 <Bosmon> stegru - so it\'s a fault in the solutions registry entry?
