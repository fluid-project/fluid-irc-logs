2018-02-19T09:30:10 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Hello, Javi! I saw that you merged some changes in GPII master related to the versions of infusion, gpii-windows and jqunit used in GPII
2018-02-19T09:30:49 <georgitodorov> In master all tests are running fine. However, I get a weird error if I try to execute the tests from the GPII-2732 branch with the versions that are present in master:
2018-02-19T09:31:16 <georgitodorov> TypeError: Cannot read property \'execute\' of undefined

2018-02-19T09:34:36 <georgitodorov> On line 157 of the surveyDialog.js there is the following statement: that.events.onSurveyCreated.fire(); which is wrapped in an IPC message callback
2018-02-19T09:35:10 <georgitodorov> There a few tests which are failing because of that. Can you please take a look and let us know what can be done to resolve this issue? Thank you!

2018-02-19T11:06:32 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: sure
2018-02-19T11:06:41 <jhernandez> just a question
2018-02-19T11:08:11 <jhernandez> have you updated your package.json to point to the most recent version of windows, and to match the versions of infusion and jqUnit from universal?
2018-02-19T11:09:02 <jhernandez> after doing that, I\'d say you have to wipe out your node_modules folder and make sure that you perform a "clean" npm install
2018-02-19T11:24:10 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: What I did was to use the versions of windows, infusion and jqUnit from master
2018-02-19T11:24:42 <georgitodorov> And to be sure I did check out the project in a new location and installed the node modules from scratch
2018-02-19T11:25:34 <jhernandez> okay

2018-02-19T14:32:57 <georgit> Bosmon, jhernandez: On my machine the test for the dimensions of the survey dialog is not failing...
2018-02-19T14:41:36 <georgit> Bosmon: As for the other error, you mentioned that this can be a consequence of some version mismatch. What exactly did you mean?
2018-02-19T14:51:53 * kasparnet has quit
2018-02-19T15:07:12 <jhernandez> georgit: may the results from the tests for the dimensions differ depending on the display?
2018-02-19T15:10:46 <georgit> jhernandez: Not sure. Can you check on your machine with the original version of the GPII-2732 branch and freshly installed modules?
2018-02-19T15:37:28 <jhernandez> georgit: sure, I was creating a new vm, since the last one was a bit "dirty"
2018-02-19T15:37:35 <jhernandez> I\'ll let you know when I\'m done
2018-02-19T15:38:23 <jhernandez> georgit: do you want me to take the GPII-2732 as it is right now, isn\'t it?
2018-02-19T15:52:36 <georgit> jhernandez: Yes, as it is now. This way you will be able to check if the issue was present even before your update of the package.json.
2018-02-19T15:58:32 * danayo joined the channel
2018-02-19T16:05:22 <Bosmon> Hi georgit - we\'ve had updates in the core architecture to versions of infusion, node-jqunit and kettle - it\'s important that all the versions of these in gpii-app are updated to matching versions
2018-02-19T16:05:30 <Bosmon> You can take the versions from the current package.json in trunk of universal
2018-02-19T16:21:37 * georgit has quit
2018-02-19T16:25:33 <jhernandez> Bosmon: FYI, I\'m seeing the same "Cannot read property \'execute\' of undefined" in the tests that "apparently" passed before pushing the update in gpii-app
2018-02-19T16:25:39 <jhernandez> https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/166/consoleText
2018-02-19T16:26:14 <jhernandez> look for the timestamp 11:53:24.067
