2018-01-11T15:34:03 <alanharnum> this article colinclark gmoss and simonjb were talking about a few days ago is very interesting: https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/on-toys-that-teach-coding-5a6de92e6ad3
2018-01-11T15:35:44 <alanharnum> this paper by Ko in particular looks like a good read: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858252&CFID=1026035594&CFTOKEN=29563884

2018-01-11T15:37:59 <alanharnum> very interesting material so far (haven't read fully) about the role of metacognition (our old friend) in developing effective programming practice:
2018-01-11T15:38:04 <alanharnum> There is
2018-01-11T15:38:04 <alanharnum> also evidence that the highest performing CS students are the
2018-01-11T15:38:04 <alanharnum> ones who are most aware of their problem solving state and
2018-01-11T15:38:06 <alanharnum> most capable of managing their cognitive resources [6]. This
2018-01-11T15:38:08 <alanharnum> suggests that learning to code not only requires effective
2018-01-11T15:38:10 <alanharnum> instruction on syntax, data structures, and abstraction, but
2018-01-11T15:38:12 <alanharnum> also the development of metacognitive awareness [37].
2018-01-11T15:40:25 <alanharnum> makes me think of this Kent Beck post on managing complexity, which I think can be read as a set of metacognitive strategies for coding: https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/one-bite-at-a-time-partitioning-complexity/1716882961677894/

2018-01-11T16:57:45 <michelled> so that we make sure we continue to focus on use cases as we research and implement infrastructure
2018-01-11T16:58:27 <michelled> grrrero: I'm curious about what's going on with the a11y theme versus the snow theme? if you have changes to make to the a11y theme that improves it, you should certainly do that - make the appropriate pull request
2018-01-11T16:58:34 <michelled> jhung: do you have opinions on that?
2018-01-11T16:58:56 <grrrero> \xc2\xa0michelled: It was the widget features that haven't been added to the parent a11y theme
2018-01-11T16:59:12 <grrrero> We were saying we might not want to push those changes in yet right jhung
2018-01-11T16:59:21 <michelled> why is that?

2018-01-11T17:00:34 <grrrero> The foundation branch that I worked off of from the a11y theme isn't merged into master yet but jhung might have a better answer
2018-01-11T17:00:55 <michelled> even so, you could make a pull request to the foundation branch
2018-01-11T17:01:09 <michelled> but we should also pull back that layer and ask why it hasn't yet been merged?
2018-01-11T17:01:13 <michelled> is there work we should do there?
2018-01-11T17:02:10 <grrrero> I guess the question is -- do we add it as part of the a11y theme or for now just use it only for SNOW?

2018-01-11T17:24:52 <javjarfer[m]> wow, that could definitely be useful, I can check it once the UI is shown but this is better
2018-01-11T17:25:04 <javjarfer[m]> this way we can check before triggering the whole thing
2018-01-11T17:25:10 <javjarfer[m]> and doing just if necessary
