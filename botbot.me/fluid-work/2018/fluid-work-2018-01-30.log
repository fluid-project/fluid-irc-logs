2018-01-30T16:02:24 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Sorry everyone I\'m running late... for SNOW yesterday michelled and colinclark and I met to discuss and we\'re meeting again with jhung this afternoon to talk about github repos and where they should be living. Been working on SNOW UIO integration and adding some code to enable categories for pages to get the about-us page to show the navigation sidebar.

2018-01-30T16:13:55 <gtirloni> is anyone using Vidyo through a web browser? I can\'t get Chrome to work anymore and Firefox barely loads the website
2018-01-30T16:14:39 <gtirloni> i think webrtc might have become busted with the latest browser updates

2018-01-30T16:56:09 <gmoss> gtirloni: I\'m not using Vidyo in a browser, but this seems like something we should investigate. a few of the SJRK partners use the Vidyo web client to connect to our calls, so this could potentially affect them. if you need someone to test things out with, I\'m willing to help!
2018-01-30T16:57:28 <gtirloni> thanks! I\'m running some tests here and will let you know
