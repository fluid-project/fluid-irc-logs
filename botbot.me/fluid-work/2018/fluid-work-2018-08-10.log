2018-08-10T22:13:26 <jhernandez> yes, I can do that
2018-08-10T22:13:59 <jhernandez> but I'm thinking on the people that don't know that workaround
2018-08-10T22:22:31 <jhernandez> stegru: if I pull your universal/#638 I would also pull your changes on the solutions registry to infer the highcontrast theme, which we decided to not ship it
2018-08-10T22:22:34 <jhernandez> is that correct?
2018-08-10T22:22:43 <stegru> ohh
2018-08-10T22:22:59 <jhernandez> I can cherry pick only your last commit if we just need that
2018-08-10T22:23:01 <stegru> ok hold on
2018-08-10T22:23:08 <stegru> oh yes
2018-08-10T22:23:12 <jhernandez> :)
2018-08-10T22:23:46 <jhernandez> I don't think we are missing anything from that pull, but let me know if you think so
2018-08-10T22:24:03 <jhernandez> cherry-picking the last commit now
2018-08-10T22:24:40 <stegru> no, i first made that change on feds-audit where i tested it, i only put it in that branch to keep it with the rest of the high-contrast things
2018-08-10T22:25:34 <stegru> i mean, the commit is ok on its own
2018-08-10T22:31:22 <jhernandez> yes
2018-08-10T22:31:25 <jhernandez> ok

2018-08-10T16:40:17 <Bosmon> If so you can just combine them

2018-08-10T17:52:45 <jhernandez> there\'s one thing that I yet need to look at
2018-08-10T17:53:04 <jhernandez> the untrusted.dynamicDR config doesn\'t work for me
2018-08-10T17:53:13 <cindyli> ah ok
2018-08-10T17:53:28 <cindyli> how can i adjust gpii-app to use another config?
2018-08-10T17:53:32 <jhernandez> sorry, but it\'s something that I found out yesterday but didn\'t have the time to look at
2018-08-10T17:53:39 <jhernandez> ok
2018-08-10T17:53:58 <jhernandez> in gpii-app/configs/app.base.json
2018-08-10T17:54:13 <cindyli> ok
2018-08-10T17:54:24 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/feds-audit/configs/app.base.json#L25
2018-08-10T17:54:52 <jhernandez> as you can see, we are already using the right set up, but still, we would like to use the dynamic device reporter as well
2018-08-10T17:55:29 <jhernandez> I\'m sure it\'s a stupid thing, but I\'m right now dealing with different stuff at the same moment

2018-08-10T18:12:17 <jhernandez> javjarfer[m]: was testing the JAWS pref sets for the demo and he\'s getting into problems, and I\'m wondering whether it can be related to the fact that https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/635/files got in recently
2018-08-10T18:18:07 <jhernandez> cindyli: just seen you fix - heh, that thing!
2018-08-10T18:18:10 <jhernandez> :)
2018-08-10T18:19:15 <jhernandez> thanks a lot!

2018-08-10T18:19:46 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/57
2018-08-10T18:21:29 <jhernandez> oh great, I was going to do the 2nd one, but far better if you already created the pr for it
2018-08-10T18:21:39 <jhernandez> :)
2018-08-10T18:21:58 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-08-10T18:22:33 <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez
2018-08-10T18:23:26 <jhernandez> now I\'m taking a break, but will take a look at test results from Bern Gregg and Kavya later
2018-08-10T18:23:52 <jhernandez> thanks to you cindyli!
2018-08-10T18:23:55 <jhernandez> :)
2018-08-10T18:28:24 <cindyli> Bosmon: have you seen Bern\'s test comments for applying high contrast themes. he\'s noticed themes don\'t apply to chrome
2018-08-10T18:30:26 <sgithens> Bosmon: when using kettle.config.loadConfig, does the component actually need to be a kettle application? Or can it just be anything you want created.  For instance would the following be functionally equivalent:      https://gist.github.com/sgithens/8126998fb4782e0297db2fcdb990dc23
2018-08-10T18:34:51 <sgithens> I ask, becase the effect is different. My express server and other stuff doesn\'t start when it\'s the loaded config
2018-08-10T18:47:41 <stegru> jhernandez: ?
2018-08-10T18:50:41 * sepidehshahi has quit
2018-08-10T18:50:57 <Bosmon> sgithens - it can be anything
2018-08-10T18:51:31 <Bosmon> sgithens - but it will not start unless you make it start
2018-08-10T18:52:20 <sgithens> Bosmon: So the action of calling gpii.devpmt() triggers and event or something that just having it in the config doesn\'t
2018-08-10T18:54:49 <sgithens> it seems like it should be the same https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleConfigLoader.js#L162
2018-08-10T18:56:38 <sgithens> oh wait
2018-08-10T18:57:57 <sgithens> hmm yeah
2018-08-10T18:58:17 <sgithens> I can manually call fluid.invokeGlobalFunction("gpii.devpmt"); and it works
2018-08-10T18:58:34 <sgithens> but the config loader doesn\'t seem to act on it
2018-08-10T18:59:30 <Bosmon> sgithens - it\'s the difference between loadConfig and runConfig
2018-08-10T19:00:01 <Bosmon> sgithens - sorry ignore that
2018-08-10T19:00:03 <Bosmon> I invented it : P
2018-08-10T19:00:21 <sgithens> Bosmon: Yes, I just tried it
2018-08-10T19:00:29 <Bosmon> It will try to construct an instance: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleConfigLoader.js#L162
2018-08-10T19:00:42 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-08-10T19:03:38 <sgithens> Bosmon, wierd, I got the return value from loadConfig, and it does look like the PPT, but it didn\'t start up the express server.  Is there some difference under the covers between calling it with it\'s constructor function, and calling it  with invokeGlobalFunction?
2018-08-10T19:03:54 <Bosmon> sgithens - no difference
2018-08-10T19:04:23 <Bosmon> One just immediately calls the other
2018-08-10T19:05:41 <jhernandez> stegru: ?
2018-08-10T19:06:01 <stegru> what did you want, jhernandez ?
2018-08-10T19:07:28 <jhernandez> cindyli: re highcontrast not working on UI+, I guess that we need to indicate that changes from the QSS won\'t affect uio+ - If you key in with a prefs set that has high contrast settings for uio+ it works and it will react to changes from the PSP
2018-08-10T19:07:33 * jhernandez shrugs
2018-08-10T19:07:36 <jhernandez> :)
2018-08-10T19:08:41 <jhernandez> stegru: just asking whether this https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/635 may affect a problem that javjarfer[m] was having when trying the prefs sets for jaws
2018-08-10T19:09:01 <jhernandez> it fails saying "the file blablabla doesn\'t exist"
2018-08-10T19:09:36 <stegru> right
2018-08-10T19:09:45 <stegru> ok
2018-08-10T19:09:53 <sgithens> Bosmon: Does it scope or sandbox the grades from the rest of infusion? because what\'s happening is I\'m getting a very limited component from the loadConfig.  It has my grade on it, but it clearly hasn\'t inheritied any of it.  Do I need to speficiy all the modules for it to bring in even though they are declared globablly?
2018-08-10T19:13:35 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-08-10T19:13:50 <sgithens> oh i see
2018-08-10T19:15:28 <cindyli> yes, jhernandez, let me see if there\'s a comment for it on the doc
2018-08-10T19:16:30 <sgithens> Bosmon: Re-reading the doco, the top level component always has to be a fluid.component, and then the thing you\'re launching is in that.  So it was actually overwriting my grade def initition with an empty fluid.component and then starting that
2018-08-10T19:16:41 <sgithens> so instead of:  { type: "gpii.devpmt" }
2018-08-10T19:16:45 <sgithens> the config has to be:
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> {
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> "type": "gpii.ppt",
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> "options": {
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> "gradeNames": "fluid.component",
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> "components": {
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> "devpmt": {
2018-08-10T19:17:02 <sgithens> "type": "gpii.devpmt"
2018-08-10T19:17:03 <sgithens> }
2018-08-10T19:17:03 <sgithens> }
2018-08-10T19:17:04 <sgithens> }
2018-08-10T19:17:04 <sgithens> }
2018-08-10T19:19:48 <cindyli> jhernandez: i added a suggestion notes to the testing doc regarding contrast changes from QSS don\'t get applied to chrome
2018-08-10T19:22:47 <jhernandez> cindyli: thanks, just replied to your comment
2018-08-10T19:22:52 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-08-10T19:23:47 <jhernandez> FYI now I\'m leaving home - will be back in a couple of hours and will check testing results and incorporate available fixes

2018-08-10T12:41:28 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks... I skimmed that this morning. Will try to look at it in more detail next week, if no else has replied yet. Just trying to get some stuff done for the APCP audit next week.
2018-08-10T12:41:56 <jhung> no prob Justin_o
2018-08-10T12:42:54 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2018-08-10T12:43:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have an example of creating the message structure similar to the websockets
2018-08-10T12:44:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it looks like this: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/KettleRequest.ws.js#L124
2018-08-10T12:44:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'d still look into the data properly of each message, and from there look for the type and payload
2018-08-10T12:45:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think this is a more scalable approach, yes
2018-08-10T12:46:04 <Bosmon> And more in keeping with what we do elsewhere
2018-08-10T12:46:12 <Bosmon> For example with Nexus messages, etc.
2018-08-10T12:46:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, that makes sense thanks
2018-08-10T13:06:44 <Bosmon> Hi there the-t-in-rtf - could you remind me why we are adjusting the package structure of eslint-config-fluid itself since it doesn\'t contain any code?
2018-08-10T13:07:05 <Bosmon> Isn\'t the reason it depends on fluid-grunt-eslint is just to lint its own index.js and Gruntfile.js ?
2018-08-10T13:07:52 <the-t-in-rtf> apparently not.
2018-08-10T13:08:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we could add it as a dependency in the lint-all plugin instead.
2018-08-10T13:08:45 <the-t-in-rtf> It might have been a red herring, just a minute.
2018-08-10T13:09:06 * g2szeto joined the channel
2018-08-10T13:10:18 <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, I guess you\'re right and it didn\'t show up before because of npm vagueries.
2018-08-10T13:10:29 <the-t-in-rtf> close it and submit against gpii-grunt-lint-all instead?
2018-08-10T13:11:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I had this vague idea that there was some kind of plugin usage in the config that brought it into scope, I just educated myself a bit.
2018-08-10T13:13:01 <the-t-in-rtf> fuck, I think we\'re getting sent in circles by grunt\'s shitty lack of npm handling.  I\'m gonna try using the new function we added.
2018-08-10T13:13:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, gpii-grunt-lint-all depends on fluid-grunt-eslint, which has a dependency on fluid-eslint as a main dependency.
2018-08-10T13:14:09 <the-t-in-rtf> grunt is just to stupid to pick up on it correctly
2018-08-10T13:16:23 <the-t-in-rtf> ugh, the rollup uses the new function already
2018-08-10T13:16:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s the require that fails: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-eslint/blob/master/tasks/eslint.js#L3
2018-08-10T13:17:48 <the-t-in-rtf> so, the new function fixes task resolution, but doesn\'t help with that kind of failure.
2018-08-10T13:19:39 <the-t-in-rtf> The only fixes I can think of are awful and ugly and incomplete.
2018-08-10T13:20:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I think we\'re just gonna have to live with a few dev dependencies for cases like this.
2018-08-10T13:20:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, grunt is just broken.
2018-08-10T13:21:14 <the-t-in-rtf> it should be able to pick up the dependency relative to the package that defines the task, but obviously can\'t.
2018-08-10T13:28:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Thinking now about how best to document, this, perhaps a quick warning in the README of the gpii-grunt-lint-all plugin?
2018-08-10T13:28:23 <Bosmon> Yes, grunt is certainly very borken
2018-08-10T13:28:37 <the-t-in-rtf> well played.
2018-08-10T13:28:45 <Bosmon> I think it is ok to advise people that they need to explicitly add certain dependencies to their top-level project in various situation
2018-08-10T13:28:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, do you know if there\'s an issue against grunt for this?
2018-08-10T13:28:59 <Bosmon> No
2018-08-10T13:29:04 <Bosmon> They consider it "working as designed"
2018-08-10T13:29:37 <Bosmon> The mere fact they don\'t use npm resolution I think shows their mentality here :)
2018-08-10T13:29:57 <the-t-in-rtf> "designed to force everyone to randomly figure out other package\'s dependencies to bring into their own manually"
2018-08-10T13:30:09 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, I believe that is how it is designed
2018-08-10T13:30:27 <Bosmon> What will the warning in the README say?
2018-08-10T13:31:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Something like "depending on where npm places dependencies for plugins used in various lint checks, you may need to add one or more of the following as dev dependencies to use the checks in this package"
2018-08-10T13:32:06 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you said above "fluid-grunt-eslint" depends on "fluid-eslint"
2018-08-10T13:32:10 <Bosmon> So what is the load path that we need
2018-08-10T13:32:24 <the-t-in-rtf> well, it doesn\'t matter
2018-08-10T13:32:37 <the-t-in-rtf> anything other than the package running the lint checks *might* fail.
2018-08-10T13:32:40 <Bosmon> I see the require that you highlighted
2018-08-10T13:32:44 <Bosmon> But how can this require fail?
2018-08-10T13:32:49 <the-t-in-rtf> dunno, but it does.
2018-08-10T13:33:09 <Bosmon> What\'s the path when you try npm ls fluid-eslint?
2018-08-10T13:33:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I was just migrating gpii-testem to use gpii-grunt-lint-all, and that require immediately failed.
2018-08-10T13:33:22 <the-t-in-rtf> it was a deep reference by way of fluid-grunt-eslint.
2018-08-10T13:34:03 <Bosmon> Well it should be
2018-08-10T13:34:08 <Bosmon> But what does it look like exactly?
2018-08-10T13:34:12 <the-t-in-rtf> "it"?
2018-08-10T13:34:21 <Bosmon> Could you pastie npm ls fluid-eslint and npm ls fluid-grunt-eslint ?
2018-08-10T13:34:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll have to break the package again for a minute.
2018-08-10T13:34:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I already fixed it by adding fluid-eslint as a dev dependency
2018-08-10T13:34:45 <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2018-08-10T13:37:07 <the-t-in-rtf> OH NO.
2018-08-10T13:37:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I read the error more closely, it\'s my fault.
2018-08-10T13:37:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I probably mangled that dependency as well and got lucky with the npm install in that package.
2018-08-10T13:38:09 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all/blob/master/tasks/json-eslint.js#L10
2018-08-10T13:38:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, at least we have a hope that it\'s fixable, I\'ll put that together and test shortly.
2018-08-10T13:38:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry for the confusion, and thanks for the help.
2018-08-10T13:42:59 <the-t-in-rtf> For my sins, I searched all requires in the package this time and confirmed all are direct dependencies.
2018-08-10T13:43:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I will put in a pull to fix that ASAP and then move on to the gpii-testem work.
2018-08-10T13:44:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Glad I did, there was one more viper hiding in the grass.

2018-08-10T14:07:00 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, morning. Give me a little bit to cut a path-fixing tool before you go too much further in your pull.
2018-08-10T14:07:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'d hate for you to struggle with something that should be much easier in a few hours.
2018-08-10T14:07:21 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hello, thanks.. that\'s for a different PR than the one i just mentioned
2018-08-10T14:07:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I know.
2018-08-10T14:07:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Just mentioning it now that I see you.
2018-08-10T14:07:34 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2018-08-10T14:07:43 <Justin_o> but i\'ll hold off changes on the other one.

2018-08-10T14:45:39 <jhernandez> you can pull, build and test if you want
2018-08-10T14:45:53 <jhernandez> I\'m going to trigger the installer creation
2018-08-10T14:45:58 <jhernandez> FYI
2018-08-10T14:46:59 <stegru> ok
2018-08-10T14:48:42 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, cindyli, jhernandez: I am observing some very strange behavior
2018-08-10T14:49:18 <georgitodorov> Whenever I change a setting in the QSS for the second, third, etc. time, I get two messages back to the PSP via the PSP channel
2018-08-10T14:49:28 <cindyli> ok
2018-08-10T14:49:38 <georgitodorov> The first message contains the old value of the setting, and the second one contains the new value
2018-08-10T14:49:55 <georgitodorov> And this is breaking the undo functionality in the QSS
2018-08-10T14:50:29 <cindyli> georgitodorov: can you send these messages?
2018-08-10T14:50:34 <jhernandez> ouch
2018-08-10T14:50:51 <georgitodorov> cindyli: just a sec
2018-08-10T14:50:57 <cindyli> just confirm this only happens when you change a setting after the first time, georgitodorov
2018-08-10T14:51:05 <cindyli> not at the first time?
2018-08-10T14:51:25 <cindyli> you receive the correct message at the first time?
2018-08-10T14:51:31 <georgitodorov> cindyli: correct
2018-08-10T14:51:43 <cindyli> ok
2018-08-10T14:55:19 <georgitodorov> cindyli, Bosmon, jhernandez: Okay, so I start the app and change the "Read Aloud" to "On" (true). Everything is fine here - I receive 1 message with the correct value
2018-08-10T14:55:35 <georgitodorov> Next, I switch off the "Read Aloud" and I get two messages
2018-08-10T14:55:44 <georgitodorov> The first one is https://pastebin.com/n9wHB4c6
2018-08-10T14:55:52 <georgitodorov> The second one is https://pastebin.com/dFH8drRK
2018-08-10T14:56:22 <cindyli> you received the 2nd message twice, right?
2018-08-10T14:56:32 <cindyli> and you expect to only receive it once
2018-08-10T14:56:38 <cindyli> georgitodorov: ^
2018-08-10T14:56:57 <georgitodorov> cindyli: no, only once. The problem lies in the first message
2018-08-10T14:57:11 <georgitodorov> It should not be there at all because the value which it contains is incorrect
2018-08-10T14:57:33 <cindyli> georgitodorov: ok, you expect not to receive the first message
2018-08-10T14:58:08 <cindyli> when you switch off the "read aloud"
2018-08-10T14:58:15 <georgitodorov> cindyli: yes, exactly
2018-08-10T14:58:23 <georgitodorov> any ideas what may have caused this?
2018-08-10T14:59:45 <cindyli> debugging. very likely related to my change to the lifecycle manager
