2018-09-10T15:28:06 <Bosmon> Hey there alanharnum - I noticed that the logs for last couple of months chat here don\'t seem to be available in botbot
2018-09-10T15:28:15 <Bosmon> Do we have a sense of whether this is a problem at our end or theirs?
2018-09-10T15:29:44 <alanharnum> Bosmon: It\'s usually been an issue with Botbot, but I\'ll ask avtar about the setup
2018-09-10T15:31:44 <alanharnum> AFAIK we just request that botbot archive the channels and it\'s otherwise out of our hands

2018-09-10T15:37:05 <alanharnum> Bosmon: what do you see missing? I\'m seeing the logs load very slowly, but they do seem load
2018-09-10T15:39:25 <alanharnum> so possibly they\'re having issues with whatever on their side actually presents the logs being responsive

2018-09-10T16:02:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: when you have some time, could you please take a look at this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/921 It\'s to centralize the copyright information in Infusion https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6325
2018-09-10T16:02:54 <colinclark> sure, i\'ll take a look
2018-09-10T16:03:01 <Justin_o> colinclark:  thanks
2018-09-10T16:12:12 <stegru> alanharnum Bosmon, I remember seeing the bot re-join the channel a few weeks back
2018-09-10T16:13:57 <alanharnum> thanks stegru - it is possible we are missing some logs if botbot had downtime

2018-09-10T17:57:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i just ran into an issue with trying to install infusion via npm as a dependency in UIO+. The problem is that it now triggers "grunt buildStylus" as a post install step ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/package.json#L22 ). However, because the grunt tasks are all dev dependencies they aren\'t available and fail. This originated from the FLUID-6309 PR (
2018-09-10T17:57:20 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/916 ). So it\'s my fault that it slipped through ;(
2018-09-10T17:57:39 <Justin_o> alanharnum, Bosmon: i wonder if you have any thoughts on how to fix this, as it seems that it may be needed for CI
2018-09-10T18:01:02 <Justin_o> I\'ve filed this as https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6338

2018-09-10T18:29:43 <Justin_o> I think we can just move the buildStylus step to prepare.

2018-09-10T18:37:12 <Justin_o> alanharnum: do i have access to get to run tests against PRs in Infusion. It doesn\'t look like they are running for me.
