2018-01-26T13:34:09 <Justin_o> alanharnum: do you know of any other library for splitting words into syllables other than https://github.com/nlp-compromise/nlp-syllables? I\'ve done some simple tests with nlp-syllables and split "widespread" as "wides\xe2\x80\xa2pread" and "however" as "however" both of which do not seem to be correct.
2018-01-26T13:37:33 <Justin_o> I\'ve been looking around and haven\'t found one.. most things dealing with syllables just seem to count them, without actually outputting the breakdown.
2018-01-26T13:40:16 * michelled joined the channel
2018-01-26T13:40:59 <Justin_o> Also other natural language processors don\'t seem to handle syllables.. i\'ve looked at https://github.com/retextjs/retext and https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural but neither seems to handle syllables.

2018-01-26T14:34:39 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I don\'t know of another offhand outside nlp-syllables - have you seen the discussion at https://github.com/nlp-compromise/nlp-syllables/issues/8?
2018-01-26T14:35:19 <alanharnum> my sense from looking around previously is that a) this problem is hard with English words and b) the best algorithms tend to be implemented in linguistics computing labs, not necessarily exposed out there are node modules
2018-01-26T14:37:28 <alanharnum> this SO question is also helpful as a survey of approaches: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/405161/detecting-syllables-in-a-word
2018-01-26T14:40:59 <alanharnum> my sense (again, this is based on limited research) is that what\'s closest to a state-of-the-art library is NLTK, which is written in Python: http://www.nltk.org/
2018-01-26T14:44:22 <alanharnum> final thought is that even the ones that only count them must do some kind of breakdown, FE https://github.com/words/syllable - we might be able to extend those to actually return the breakdown

2018-01-26T15:35:07 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks.. i\'ll look at those links.. regarding the counting.. i\'ve seen algorithms for doing this by counting the vowels and subtracting the silent ones and those that form pairs to make a single sound.. which i suppose may not accurately correspond to the syllables.. kind of like wides\xe2\x80\xa2pread vs wide\xe2\x80\xa2spread
2018-01-26T15:35:22 <Justin_o> although i think that error comes from different logic
2018-01-26T15:38:09 <alanharnum> Justin_o: if you read some of the summaries of accuracy rates on even what seem to be the best-in-class phonetic encoding systems (which are commonly a foundation of syllable recognition), you see numbers like 89% for Double Metaphone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone
2018-01-26T15:41:22 * georgitodorov has quit
2018-01-26T15:41:37 <alanharnum> Justin_o: this project may be worth looking at https://github.com/words
2018-01-26T15:42:46 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, i was looking a bit at this package from them the other day https://github.com/words/syllable
2018-01-26T15:43:04 <Justin_o> but again it looks like it only counts.. but i could have missed something.. i see they also have metaphone implementations too
2018-01-26T15:43:21 <alanharnum> Justin_o: the comment here from the main developer of compromise-syllable is interesting: https://github.com/nlp-compromise/nlp-syllables/issues/8#issuecomment-335534251
2018-01-26T15:44:33 <Justin_o> alanharnum:  there are some libraries i\'ve seen to split words into the phonemes
2018-01-26T15:45:09 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah, part of the challenge I\'ve had in researching this stuff is that the terminology is highly specialized, not just linguistics, but linguistics computing / NLP
2018-01-26T15:45:12 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2018-01-26T15:45:18 <alanharnum> so just knowing what to look for can be challenging
2018-01-26T15:45:53 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i think the feature they are looking for is something like the syllables feature from here https://www.onenote.com/learningtools
2018-01-26T15:46:29 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes.. i agree.. so another issue i brought up the other day is that the context/usage of the word matters for example re\xe2\x80\xa2cord vs rec\xe2\x80\xa2ord
2018-01-26T15:46:41 <Justin_o> and dialects too
2018-01-26T15:49:48 <alanharnum> my strong sense is that even for people who have invested years of research and substantial money in this, "extremely good" is still a success rate of somewhere about 85-90%
2018-01-26T15:50:05 <alanharnum> English in particular is just flat-out hard to consistently recognize syllables for
2018-01-26T15:51:39 <alanharnum> so I think it needs to be clear that any implementation of this for UIO+ that\'s the context of this, and a first round of "good enough to be helpful, but not perfect" may be what\'s achievable.
2018-01-26T15:53:36 <alanharnum> nlp-syllables may just in fact be the best open source node module currently available. it\'s possible you could get better results from (FE) NLTK, but that\'s in Python: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/23376/how-to-get-the-number-of-syllables-in-a-word
2018-01-26T15:57:59 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes.. hard to disagree with you on that.. although my worry with nlp-syllable is that it seems to have problems with words that are relatively common (i.e. "however"). So I\'m left wondering what the usefulness of this preference is if the accuracy is low.. i guess I\'ll pass along this question to the UX team
2018-01-26T15:58:23 <Justin_o> thanks for all the help, i\'ll save a link to this conversation for future reference
2018-01-26T15:58:24 <alanharnum> yeah the fact that it can\'t "however" frankly surprise me
2018-01-26T16:01:05 <alanharnum> Justin_o: it may also be worth looking at "hyphenation", which is closely related: https://github.com/bramstein/hypher - a lot of the answers to "how do I recognize syllables" seem to be "your best bet is the TeX hyphenation algorithm"
2018-01-26T16:02:16 <Justin_o> alanharnum: actually i started looking at that this morning.. started a fiddle but it doesn\'t seem to be working yet. https://jsfiddle.net/a37rfdxe/2/
2018-01-26T16:02:28 <Justin_o> could have something to do with the way i\'ve linked in the external resources.. but not sure
