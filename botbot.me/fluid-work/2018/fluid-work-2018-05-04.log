b'2018-05-04T22:15:13 <Bosmon> Since it uses a slightly rehoused version of its change protocol
2018-05-04T22:15:40 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s an interesting point - in terms of just this "rehousing" I was mentioning
2018-05-04T22:15:50 <Bosmon> I realised that it is best to send typed messages down a WebSockets bus
2018-05-04T22:15:58 <Bosmon> So that targetted change messages can coexist with other things
2018-05-04T22:16:06 <Bosmon> But the "Nexus proper" is a bit backward about this
2018-05-04T22:16:15 <Bosmon> There are some improvements from the PSP channel we need to feed back to it
2018-05-04T22:16:25 <Bosmon> And then also we need to make the reconnection "metaprotocol"
2018-05-04T22:17:30 <sgithens> interesting
2018-05-04T22:17:46 <sgithens> so I should take a look at he PSP protocol that goes over the wire
2018-05-04T22:17:52 <sgithens> which is just going to the local flowmanager
2018-05-04T22:18:48 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-05-04T22:18:55 <Bosmon> Well there\'s not much to the difference here yet
2018-05-04T22:19:27 <Bosmon> It\'s just that i) messages are quoted with types, and ii) we don\'t send the raw change value as an entire message on connection, which means that we can properly report a model whose initial value is `undefined`

2018-05-04T16:36:16 <mrtyler> and it looks like this is someting you wrote from scratch? i.e. it\'s not a 3rdparty role or anything
2018-05-04T16:36:25 <gtirloni> right
2018-05-04T16:36:52 <mrtyler> ok cool
2018-05-04T16:37:07 <mrtyler> and this is a complete replacement for this role, right? https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-docker
2018-05-04T16:37:29 <mrtyler> the old non-ce role does some stuff with network devices and things, but those are no longer needed?
2018-05-04T16:38:50 <gtirloni> i don\'t think they are... that\'s working around bugs in the old docker I think
2018-05-04T16:39:04 <gtirloni> the storage stuff is very redhat-specific too
2018-05-04T16:39:24 <mrtyler> e.g. https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-docker/blob/master/tasks/deploy.yml
2018-05-04T16:39:34 <mrtyler> ok great
2018-05-04T16:39:42 <mrtyler> i\'ll give this role a shot
2018-05-04T16:39:48 <mrtyler> thanks for the help :)

2018-05-04T17:52:25 <sgithens> cindyli: Based on our discussion yesterday, I\'d like to draft out if possible what the json would look like for keys assuming different types of them contained all the login credentials for vraious types of auth systems.  Where would be a good place for me to put that? On a jira? on a subpage from your Keys/Tokens/Prefs wiki page? Somewhere else?
2018-05-04T17:53:07 <sgithens> maybe just on that etherpad
2018-05-04T17:53:21 <cindyli> "a subpage from your Keys/Tokens/Prefs wiki page" sounds good
2018-05-04T17:53:48 <cindyli> or probably a different section on the Keys/Tokens/Prefs wiki page
2018-05-04T17:54:17 <sgithens> great thanks!
2018-05-04T17:54:59 <cindyli> thank you for putting in more thoughts on this
2018-05-04T17:55:48 <sgithens> I\'m very keen to see this get pushed forward soon :)  After years of working on the core parts of the project I\'m excited for people to actually be able to sign up and use it :p
2018-05-04T17:56:11 <sgithens> also for us not to make the same mistakes from other systems about having multiple login types
2018-05-04T17:57:11 <sgithens> Which happens every time one of my ancestors initially signs in to some new webapp using google or facebook, and then later wants to switch to a username and password, and it\'s nearly impossible to make it work correctly
2018-05-04T18:28:19 * stegru joined the channel
2018-05-04T18:38:06 <sgithens> Is the all the communication the PSP sends out still to just the local flowmanager, or is there some work already done on the configuation that will save things up to a cloud prefsserver/flowmanager?
2018-05-04T18:51:01 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-05-04T19:06:51 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-04T19:13:01 <cindyli> sorry, sgithens, just saw ur msg. yes, PSP still sends out to the local flow manager and doesn\'t save to the cloud yet
2018-05-04T19:13:10 <cindyli> saving to the cloud is on my to do list
2018-05-04T19:13:19 <sgithens> cindyli: aha cool
2018-05-04T19:13:26 <sgithens> but you haven\'t started it at all yet?
2018-05-04T19:13:36 <sgithens> Also, not sure if you would know
2018-05-04T19:13:37 <sgithens> but
2018-05-04T19:14:05 <cindyli> started a bit but putting on hold due to the change to 2630
2018-05-04T19:14:14 <sgithens> I\'m looking through the code, and I see that the PSP sends updates to the local flow manager, but I\'m wondering, does get updates at all from the local flowmanager?
2018-05-04T19:14:33 <sgithens> Like if a prefset changed on the local flowmanager, would the PSP get updated to rerender and adjust itself?
2018-05-04T19:14:46 <cindyli> i believe so
2018-05-04T19:14:49 <sgithens> cindyli: For sure, 2630 is def the priority
2018-05-04T19:15:24 <cindyli> psp talks to LFM via a web socket. when a prefs set changes, psp should receive a notification
2018-05-04T19:15:35 <cindyli> but we should confirm this with Bosmon
2018-05-04T19:15:46 <sgithens> I imagine that would happen by the PSP heartbeating the local flowmanager, or does it actually get a websocket update it premptively
2018-05-04T19:15:47 <sgithens> for sure
2018-05-04T19:15:50 <sgithens> I\'ll check with him
2018-05-04T19:16:02 <cindyli> thanks
2018-05-04T19:16:02 <sgithens> I\'m looking at prototyping an APPLY function
2018-05-04T19:16:21 <cindyli> what is that
2018-05-04T19:16:31 <sgithens> so that if you updated something in the PPT, the local flow manager would pick it up from the cloud, and adjust things locally
2018-05-04T19:16:39 <cindyli> i see
2018-05-04T19:16:49 <sgithens> so like the local flow manger would heartbeat the cloudflowmanager or something
2018-05-04T19:17:16 <cindyli> nice feature
2018-05-04T19:17:20 <sgithens> do we have any configs yet where the local flow manager talks to the cloud one?
2018-05-04T19:17:34 <cindyli> what configs do you mean?
2018-05-04T19:17:36 <sgithens> to get the prefs
2018-05-04T19:17:42 <cindyli> APIs?
2018-05-04T19:17:49 <sgithens> I mean, like, the different configurations we use for starting the gpii
2018-05-04T19:18:01 <sgithens> gpii.local.prod.psp.devicereporter.stuff.something.json
2018-05-04T19:18:07 <cindyli> yes we do
2018-05-04T19:18:22 <cindyli> let me find it
2018-05-04T19:18:32 <sgithens> cindyli: Thanks!
2018-05-04T19:19:12 <cindyli> sgithens: this is the dev config for both cloud and local flow manager running locally
2018-05-04T19:19:13 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json
2018-05-04T19:20:23 <sgithens> awesome, and that assumes that there is a corresponding set of cloud servers on 8084
2018-05-04T19:20:44 <cindyli> it doesn\'t assume, it will start the cloud server on 8084
2018-05-04T19:20:51 <sgithens> ah
2018-05-04T19:21:02 <sgithens> so this configuration only starts a cloudserver
2018-05-04T19:21:08 <sgithens> it doesn\'t also start a local flowmanager
2018-05-04T19:21:45 <cindyli> this part start the local flow manager: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json#L6-L9
2018-05-04T19:22:28 <sgithens> cindyli: Awesome, probably on like port 8081 by default?
2018-05-04T19:22:40 <cindyli> exactly
2018-05-04T19:23:26 <sgithens> so, if I hacked the configs a bit in the GPII-app so that the flowmanager portion looked like this, the PSP would essentially read it\'s start up configs from the cloud preferences (via the local flowmanager of course)
2018-05-04T19:23:48 <cindyli> yes, i think so
2018-05-04T19:23:52 <sgithens> great
2018-05-04T19:24:14 <sgithens> and then maybe I could stick a quick prototype hack in somewhere, for it to check the cloudserver everyonce in a while
2018-05-04T19:26:41 <cindyli> good luck
2018-05-04T19:27:23 <sgithens> Thanks!  :)
2018-05-04T19:28:06 <sgithens> I think I\'ll need a little input from Bosmon on it, but I believe I nearly have everything I need to make a demo
2018-05-04T19:28:14 <sgithens> or prototype
2018-05-04T19:28:38 <cindyli> that\'s great
2018-05-04T19:42:24 <cindyli> hi mrtyler, wonder if you could help me with this problem: I modified and rebuilt the data loader image. then running gpii-infra "rake deploy_only" to redeploy my dev cloud and hitting this error - https://pastebin.com/5vk92qpe
2018-05-04T19:42:38 <cindyli> it complaints about "Invalid value"
2018-05-04T19:42:47 <cindyli> but i cannot tell which value is invalid
2018-05-04T19:42:54 <mrtyler> cindyli: yeah we\'ve talked about this
2018-05-04T19:42:59 <mrtyler> you have to delete the dataloader job and re-create it
2018-05-04T19:43:18 <cindyli> ah ha
2018-05-04T19:43:22 <mrtyler> you can\'t change the docker image of an existing Job
2018-05-04T19:43:48 <cindyli> how can i delete the old job
2018-05-04T19:44:02 <cindyli> sorry you probably have taught me how to do it
2018-05-04T19:44:09 <mrtyler> yeah i think it\'s in your notes somewhere
2018-05-04T19:44:24 <mrtyler> the easiest way is rake undeploy, rake deploy_only
2018-05-04T19:44:32 <mrtyler> you can also delete the Job from the k8s dashboard
2018-05-04T19:44:40 <mrtyler> or you can use kubectl delete job
2018-05-04T19:45:06 <cindyli> trying...

2018-05-04T22:07:08 <sgithens> Bosmon: A new websockets bus for the local flowmanager to talk back to the PSP, or a new websockets bus for the cloudbased flowmanager to communicate these pushes/heartbeats back to the local flowmanager?
2018-05-04T22:07:55 <Bosmon> The latter
2018-05-04T22:07:59 <sgithens> Bosmon: This has ended up on the MVP document, which is why I\'m looking in to it\'s prototype
2018-05-04T22:08:01 <Bosmon> It\'s not really going to be a heartbeat, just updates
2018-05-04T22:09:07 <sgithens> but the local machine would have to check the server occasionally right?  I don\'t think we can a push model in this situation where the cloudserver connects to the client? ( or maybe my definitiaon of heartbeat is wrong)
2018-05-04T22:09:19 <sgithens> the local machine would have to ping the cloud for updates occasionally
2018-05-04T22:10:04 * rutvi has quit
2018-05-04T22:10:21 <Bosmon> sgithens - we don\'t need to ping the cloud if we have an open WebSockets bus
2018-05-04T22:10:44 <sgithens> I see, they can just stay open for a reasonable period of time?
2018-05-04T22:10:49 <Bosmon> FOR EVER
2018-05-04T22:10:51 <Bosmon> That is what they are for
2018-05-04T22:10:54 <sgithens> kJKL!J!LKJ!!!!
2018-05-04T22:11:02 <sgithens> FOREVER!
2018-05-04T22:11:06 <Bosmon> It will stay open for the duration of the key-in session
2018-05-04T22:11:20 <sgithens> THE ENTIRE KEYIN SESSION WEBSOCKET BUS!
2018-05-04T22:11:26 <sgithens> that\'s great
2018-05-04T22:12:01 <sgithens> I guess i need to brush up on the specifics of websockets... like what happens if the network is dodgy and stuff
2018-05-04T22:12:23 <sgithens> like if the wireless goes down for 45 seconds and comes back up... the WS connection is still ok-ish?
2018-05-04T22:12:24 <Bosmon> Well, we will have to bracket it with some kind of meta-protocol
2018-05-04T22:12:28 <Bosmon> But that\'s what the Nexus is for
2018-05-04T22:12:45 <Bosmon> It is the main virtue of having "integral protocols"
2018-05-04T22:12:59 <sgithens> are we using hte nexus for anything in universal at the moment?
2018-05-04T22:14:37 <Bosmon> no
2018-05-04T22:14:46 <Bosmon> I mean, in a sense it doesn\'t really exist
2018-05-04T22:14:54 <Bosmon> And neither does this "meta-protocol" that I am speaking about
2018-05-04T22:15:01 <Bosmon> You could say that the "PSP channel" is already an incarnation of the Nexus
2018-05-04T22:15:13 <sgithens> can a nexus service be spun up on existing kettle port, or does it have to start up it\'s own complete thing?

2018-05-04T10:25:05 <georgit> It contains quite a large change set :(
2018-05-04T10:26:19 <Bosmon> georgit - that\'s fine, we\'ve seen bigger ones :)
2018-05-04T10:27:08 <kasparnet> where do you see query process?
2018-05-04T10:27:19 <Bosmon> kasparnet - in the pull against universal you just issued
2018-05-04T10:27:22 <Bosmon> That is, you got rid of it
2018-05-04T10:27:26 <kasparnet> lies!!! all lies
2018-05-04T10:27:31 <kasparnet> oh, i see
2018-05-04T10:27:31 <Bosmon> I\'m just asking after this "how has this ever worked" idiom : P
2018-05-04T10:28:44 <kasparnet> oh, i see, it would be the old windows registeredAT launch handlers "get" - i.e. definig which process to check for
2018-05-04T10:29:13 <kasparnet> which was changed as per josephs review comment (and pull requests)
2018-05-04T10:32:51 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I see, I\'m just puzzled that there doesn\'t seem to be anything that reads it in current trunk
2018-05-04T10:33:15 <Bosmon> Is this because of some previous incompletely finished pull?
2018-05-04T10:35:14 <kasparnet> it\'s cause it was windows specific functionality https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/120
2018-05-04T10:35:47 <kasparnet> ah: "yes yes, I know, but where the hell is the damn universal solution registry entries for this stuff?"

2018-05-04T10:38:52 <Bosmon> ah ah I see
2018-05-04T10:39:00 <Bosmon> This is a block nested within that particular ,a
2018-05-04T10:39:04 <Bosmon> launchHandler type
2018-05-04T10:39:28 <Bosmon> But bizarrely it still is ...........
2018-05-04T10:40:34 <Bosmon> Why does the "enabledRegisteredAT" launch handler take such different arguments to the "flexibleHandler" for what is arguably the same function?
2018-05-04T10:40:42 <Bosmon> I mean, arguably they have been brought one step closer
2018-05-04T10:40:46 <Bosmon> But why not actually make them the same
2018-05-04T10:42:09 <kasparnet> i.e. call it getState
2018-05-04T10:42:48 <kasparnet> ?
2018-05-04T10:42:56 <kasparnet> I think that would definitely make sense
2018-05-04T10:43:42 <Bosmon> Given we\'ve touched everything in this pair of pulls, could we do this now?

2018-05-04T11:04:57 <Bosmon> kasparnet ^
2018-05-04T11:05:13 <kasparnet> ofc
2018-05-04T11:14:29 <Bosmon> hey brilliant, thanks
2018-05-04T11:27:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon, ok, updated both and check on my computer and everything seems to pass... updated the pull (https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/173) .. waiting for CI to verify
2018-05-04T11:54:08 <Bosmon> Yay it\'s a ..... PARSS!
2018-05-04T11:54:32 <kasparnet> yay
2018-05-04T11:55:30 <Bosmon> kasparnet - so does this mean we close #120 now?
2018-05-04T11:55:54 <kasparnet> yes
2018-05-04T11:56:16 <kasparnet> not sure why i didn\'t just update that one, but...

2018-05-04T12:10:07 <gtirloni> <gtirloni> Justin_o: i\'ll retrigger your last failed build, one sec
2018-05-04T12:10:07 <gtirloni> <gtirloni> the directory had 1.7GB of coverage data
2018-05-04T12:10:07 <gtirloni> <gtirloni> the last build failed due to lack of memory, i think istambul is loading everything into memory
2018-05-04T12:10:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, i hadn\'t realized it failed. Please let me know if it was something caused by my PR
2018-05-04T12:10:30 <gtirloni> i erased the coverage data and restarted it
2018-05-04T12:10:36 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks

2018-05-04T12:29:58 <Justin_o> it says "Killed by signal 15"
2018-05-04T12:30:26 <gtirloni> i killed it, i\'ll start again
2018-05-04T12:30:33 <Justin_o> okay

2018-05-04T14:29:12 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: good morning.. Bosmon merged my fix for the line-height enactor in Infusion. You may want to update to the latest Infusion master for the inclusive cities site.
2018-05-04T14:30:39 <neuralmilkhotel> Justin_o: This should do the trick right? ```grunt custom --include="uiOptions"```
2018-05-04T14:31:51 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: yep after updating master, that should be all that\'s needed
2018-05-04T14:32:56 <neuralmilkhotel> Cool thanks Justin_o
2018-05-04T14:34:35 <Bosmon> avtar, amatas[m] or somebody - could you remind me how to grab the current version of our Windows 10 box?
2018-05-04T14:34:42 <Bosmon> I am getting a 404 when I try to do vagrant box update
2018-05-04T14:35:33 <Justin_o> neuralmilkhotel: i\'m about to head offline, if you have any problems with the build you can try to send me an e-mail or alanharnum or cindyli might be able to help you.
2018-05-04T14:35:48 <neuralmilkhotel> Ok sounds good, thanks Justin_o -- have a good weekend :)
2018-05-04T14:35:55 <Justin_o> thanks, you too
2018-05-04T14:35:58 <alanharnum> Justin_o neuralmilkhotel: sure thing - I\'ll be in the office post-standup
2018-05-04T14:36:30 <neuralmilkhotel> alanharnum: \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d
2018-05-04T14:36:46 <Justin_o> thanks
2018-05-04T14:40:56 <avtar> Bosmon: is this what you\'re trying? vagrant box update --box inclusivedesign/windows10-eval-x64-Apps
2018-05-04T14:41:32 <Bosmon> avtar yes, that
2018-05-04T14:41:58 <Bosmon> If I try to "add" the box I get this: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/inclusivedesign/windows10-eval-x64-Apps returned error 404 Not Found
2018-05-04T14:42:25 <Bosmon> Which is indeed a 404
2018-05-04T14:45:22 * kasparnet has quit
2018-05-04T14:46:54 <avtar> Bosmon: hmm that looks like a url from their decommissioned service
2018-05-04T14:47:10 <avtar> it should be directing you to vagrantcloud.com
2018-05-04T14:47:11 <avtar> https://www.pastery.net/ujvtqc/raw/
2018-05-04T14:48:00 <avtar> which version of vagrant are you using?
2018-05-04T14:48:10 <Bosmon> 1.9.1
2018-05-04T14:48:32 <avtar> i would update that and try again
2018-05-04T14:49:01 <Bosmon> Do the later versions work? : P
2018-05-04T14:49:05 <Bosmon> I often found they didn\'t
2018-05-04T14:49:23 <avtar> i seem to have 2.0.1 here
2018-05-04T14:49:30 <Bosmon> Our current instructions recommend 1.8.6: https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments
2018-05-04T14:50:34 <avtar> Bosmon: that should be "1.9.2 or newer" https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments/pull/10/files
2018-05-04T14:50:40 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-05-04T14:50:48 <avtar> which i guess now might be 2.0 or newer

2018-05-04T16:28:28 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-05-04T16:28:33 <mrtyler> i can provide more context but i think i need a newer docker than what the centos/epel repos provide
2018-05-04T16:29:40 <mrtyler> it looks like we can move off of upstream centos/epel and switch to docker-provided repos
2018-05-04T16:29:47 <mrtyler> see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-centos-7 and/or https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/install-use-setup-docker-on-rhel7-centos7-linux/
2018-05-04T16:29:51 <gtirloni> hi! we\'ve tested docker-ce 17.03 and 18.03 with good results in other hosts, it seems fine to switch to it if you want
2018-05-04T16:30:04 <gtirloni> overlay2 fs should speed things up too
2018-05-04T16:30:27 <mrtyler> ok cool
2018-05-04T16:30:42 <mrtyler> how are you installing docker-ce 17/18 on those other hosts? is there ansible code for it?
