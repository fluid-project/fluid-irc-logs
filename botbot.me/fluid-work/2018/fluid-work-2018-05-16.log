2018-05-16T16:31:23 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2018-05-16T16:31:32 <Bosmon> DBConst line 39 is still showing up unchanged for me
2018-05-16T16:32:20 <cindyli> ummm.. it\'s changed in my branch. let me check the pull request diff
2018-05-16T16:32:40 <Bosmon> To me it shows as "        message: "The record of type \\"%docName\\" was not found","
2018-05-16T16:32:43 <Bosmon> How does it look for you?
2018-05-16T16:33:08 <cindyli> isn\'t that what should be changed to?
2018-05-16T16:33:11 <cindyli> same
2018-05-16T16:33:38 * gtirloni has quit
2018-05-16T16:33:43 <cindyli> the old line was "The record of %docName is not found"

2018-05-16T16:34:20 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I see a word was added
2018-05-16T16:34:24 <Bosmon> Here\'s the original comment: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/591#discussion_r188438256
2018-05-16T16:34:43 <cindyli> i see, docType
2018-05-16T16:34:49 <cindyli> sorry. making change
2018-05-16T16:34:58 <Bosmon> Also "A" reads better, I think
2018-05-16T16:35:13 <Bosmon> Given who knows which record it actually was : P
2018-05-16T16:35:26 <cindyli> so "A record of type..."
2018-05-16T16:35:30 <cindyli> will do
