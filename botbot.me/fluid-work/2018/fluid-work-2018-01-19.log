b'2018-01-19T20:24:43 <stegru> yes
2018-01-19T20:24:52 <colinclark> ok
2018-01-19T20:25:11 <colinclark> I have noted in my feedback that it likely represents a somewhat significant additional operations cost for us in the long run
2018-01-19T20:25:29 <colinclark> but I guess we\'ll see if that cost is worth paying in order to lower the cost of custom development, perhaps
2018-01-19T20:25:34 <stegru> yes.. the expensive low upfront cost
2018-01-19T20:25:38 <colinclark> right
2018-01-19T20:26:12 <colinclark> stegru: You\'ve obviously done a good job working with them
2018-01-19T20:26:31 <colinclark> their proposal seemed to get what we want in a way that many of the previous inteviewees we talked to did not ;)
2018-01-19T20:26:32 <stegru> not really, I only read the proposal
2018-01-19T20:26:46 <stegru> yes, i was impressed how well they got it!
2018-01-19T20:27:15 <stegru> actually, it completely matched my understanding of the requirements
2018-01-19T20:27:24 <colinclark> yes, it seems pretty decent
2018-01-19T20:28:02 <stegru> shit, i didn\'t read the 2nd one
2018-01-19T20:29:07 <stegru> ah nice.. at first they recommended sql server (express)
2018-01-19T20:29:36 <stegru> i mean, nice that they listened to my suggestion of something smaller
2018-01-19T20:33:16 <colinclark> yes, that\'s great
2018-01-19T20:33:42 <colinclark> another case where paying SQL Server licensing fees as we scale would really suck
2018-01-19T20:34:00 <colinclark> from a sustainability perspective
2018-01-19T20:34:29 <stegru> yeh, it would be unfeasible.. although, the express version is free
2018-01-19T20:34:52 <stegru> it\'s the default (or only) option for windows developers
2018-01-19T20:35:00 <stegru> "just because"
2018-01-19T20:39:43 <colinclark> right
2018-01-19T20:40:02 <colinclark> but as soon as you hit bottlenecks, presumably you end up looking at upgrading
2018-01-19T20:40:58 <stegru> yes
2018-01-19T20:41:27 <stegru> but really, I don\'t think they\'ll be reached - it\'s only to store information about the available packages
2018-01-19T20:42:01 <stegru> so that tell me that there\'s no need for something bulky, like sql server
2018-01-19T20:42:31 <stegru> linux can manage its packages without a database server
2018-01-19T20:43:04 <colinclark> yep
2018-01-19T20:43:23 <colinclark> storing metdata about packages hardly even seems relational

2018-01-19T19:32:56 <colinclark> it\'s friday night, so maybe you\'re already gone for the day? :)
2018-01-19T20:11:08 <stegru> i\'m here colinclark
2018-01-19T20:19:28 <colinclark> hey stegru, sorry, i was out to get some late lunch
2018-01-19T20:19:39 <colinclark> Do we have any standard tooling for non-JavaScript testing?
2018-01-19T20:19:45 <colinclark> I know it\'s something you and clown have looked at in the past
2018-01-19T20:19:57 <colinclark> I\'m just suggesting a few points for the IoD proposal
2018-01-19T20:20:06 <stegru> no, nothing.. just what clown has looked into
2018-01-19T20:20:16 <colinclark> ok
2018-01-19T20:20:17 <stegru> in that case, let them decide?
2018-01-19T20:20:30 <colinclark> yeah, that\'s fine
2018-01-19T20:20:50 <colinclark> I\'ve put this into the section in our "Contributing Code" document, after where we talk about jqUnit, WebDriver, etc.
2018-01-19T20:20:59 <colinclark> "The use of other programming languages will require a comparable unit test harness."
2018-01-19T20:21:12 <colinclark> which at least sets the expectation without prescribing the tool
2018-01-19T20:21:38 <stegru> hmm.. they might want to use microsoft\'s unit test libraries.. and that might only come with visual studio profession (I\'ll have to check)
2018-01-19T20:21:46 <colinclark> ah, that\'s a good point
2018-01-19T20:21:58 <colinclark> perhaps I\'ll say "free unit test harness"
2018-01-19T20:22:04 <stegru> yeh
2018-01-19T20:22:13 <colinclark> What\'s your take on the idea of the server component of the IoD work being a Windows server?
2018-01-19T20:22:30 <stegru> i\'m not over the moon about it
2018-01-19T20:22:47 <colinclark> ok
2018-01-19T20:23:09 <stegru> but, I\'m guessing it\'s what the know best
2018-01-19T20:23:21 <colinclark> do you see any technical reason why it couldn\'t be Docker containers running on Linux instead of on Windows Server?
2018-01-19T20:23:29 <colinclark> as opposed to familiarity reasons, I mean
2018-01-19T20:23:44 * avtar joined the channel
2018-01-19T20:24:17 <stegru> I think they\'re going to use a ready made package repository, nuget-something
2018-01-19T20:24:27 <colinclark> ah
2018-01-19T20:24:37 <colinclark> which already has a client/server architecture that they can just go with as-is?
2018-01-19T20:24:40 <stegru> it\'s actually .NET, so in theory it\'s now available for linux
