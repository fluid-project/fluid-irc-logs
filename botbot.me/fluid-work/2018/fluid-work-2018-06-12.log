2018-06-12T17:47:59 <the-t-in-rtf> there is an API call to list all pads that it would be very helpful to have someone use.
2018-06-12T17:48:11 <the-t-in-rtf> We are trying to find some older pads that are not grouped in to the normal visible folders.

2018-06-12T18:52:23 <sgithens> I can load github in the fedora vm with firefox
2018-06-12T18:57:42 <cindyli> sgithens: don\'t see it, i have this script running in my fedora box right now. but i didn\'t re-provision the box.

2018-06-12T19:13:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like it\'s slightly more configurable monkey patching.
2018-06-12T19:13:18 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. they have a check to see if they need to make the swap.
2018-06-12T19:13:36 <the-t-in-rtf> but otherwise there\'s no compelling value vs. what we\'ve done.

2018-06-12T20:30:15 <michelled> I want to do some CISL planning
2018-06-12T20:38:23 <alanharnum> michelled: sure - do you have access to their wiki? would that be helpful for you to have?
2018-06-12T20:38:38 <alanharnum> I can ask Boris or Mia, you\'d have more insight into the kind of work they\'re doing that way, etc
2018-06-12T20:39:03 <michelled> alanharnum: I think my task will mostly be to ask all of you questions and make a plan
2018-06-12T20:39:11 <michelled> as long as you and Jon have that access, we\'ll be fine
