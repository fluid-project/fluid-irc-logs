2018-10-10T19:22:28 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf:  Any idea why upgrading from gpii-handlebars 1.1.0 to 1.1.1 would cause "Assertion failure - check console for more details: Error in assembleCreatorArguments: cannot look up component type name gpii.handlebars.renderer.serverAware to a component creator grade with an argumentMap" If I go back to 1.1.0 it goes away.
2018-10-10T19:22:55 <sgithens> I tried moving back to the version of infusion in the handlebars package.json as well
2018-10-10T19:24:30 * jhernandez_ has quit
2018-10-10T19:24:52 <sgithens> It looks like it might be coming from a gpii.handlebars.templateManager call in the client generated by the initBlock helper

2018-10-10T22:07:51 <sgithens> it looks like maybe serverMessageAware is meant to replace the usage of templateAware
2018-10-10T22:10:27 <sgithens> but it doesn\'t seem to have a onMarkupRendered event
2018-10-10T22:19:47 <sgithens> moving back to templateAware... but it can\'t find my template.  I did try adding templateUrl: "/hbs" to the grade
2018-10-10T22:20:51 <sgithens> I\'ll back off to 1.1.0 and work on a few other things until we can touch base tomorrow

b'2018-10-10T11:34:21 <jhernandez_> in fact, I have different results from my last run on CI
2018-10-10T11:34:37 <jhernandez_> (nothing new here)
2018-10-10T11:35:01 <the-t-in-rtf> in-teresting.
2018-10-10T11:35:12 <jhernandez_> let me try again on c:\\vagrant if I now get the hang
2018-10-10T11:35:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I didn\'t think anything had hung but I can\'t seem to exit that powershell session.
2018-10-10T11:35:37 <dandimitrov> jhernandez_: Thanks, we were meaning to try them out as soon as we\xe2\x80\x99ve finished with tests
2018-10-10T11:36:08 <jhernandez_> the-t-in-rtf: then you get the hang
2018-10-10T11:36:39 <jhernandez_> it\'s not a "hang", it\'s just that it doesn\'t returns
2018-10-10T11:36:45 <the-t-in-rtf> interesting.
2018-10-10T11:36:54 <the-t-in-rtf> I couldn\'t get it to hang up with a single run of the coverage
2018-10-10T11:37:04 <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps there\'s something earlier in a full run that won\'t release when run from c:/vagrant
2018-10-10T11:38:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I think the coverage may be a red herring.
2018-10-10T11:38:03 <jhernandez_> in CI, it leads to an error because we\'re calling the tests through the winrm plugin, which is not getting any return (and times out)
2018-10-10T11:38:17 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I think it\'s something left over from the test run.
2018-10-10T11:38:33 <the-t-in-rtf> I can run npm run posttest ten times and still exit the powershell
2018-10-10T11:38:37 <jhernandez_> can\'t tell, really
2018-10-10T11:38:40 * jhernandez_ shrugs
2018-10-10T11:38:45 <the-t-in-rtf> gonna try to narrow it down.
2018-10-10T11:39:16 <the-t-in-rtf> (once I confirm that I consistently see the hang)
2018-10-10T11:39:29 <the-t-in-rtf> or in other words, once I get the hang of it.
2018-10-10T11:40:31 <jhernandez_> dandimitrov: sure, FYI tests are passing here
2018-10-10T11:40:35 <jhernandez_> ;)
2018-10-10T11:45:34 <dandimitrov> jhernandez_: Yep, but we\xe2\x80\x99re writing more tests. We\xe2\x80\x99re adressing comments from Bosmon in our PR
2018-10-10T11:46:20 <jhernandez_> dandimitrov: sure, in fact, I prefer to perform the updates on windows before shipping it into gpii-app
2018-10-10T11:49:34 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I just confirmed that if I run the tests from c:/vagrant, I can\'t exit the shell afterwards.
2018-10-10T11:49:38 <the-t-in-rtf> let me try another little something.
2018-10-10T11:50:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m removing the posttest step temporarily to confirm that it\'s something in the main tests that leaves things in an unclean state.
2018-10-10T12:02:52 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, as I thought, it\'s the tests themselves that result in the shell not exiting, but only when running from c:/vagrant
2018-10-10T12:02:58 <the-t-in-rtf> so it\'s very much nothing to do with coverage
2018-10-10T12:03:11 <the-t-in-rtf> well, or at least not with reporting
2018-10-10T12:03:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll keep narrowing it down.
2018-10-10T12:03:26 <the-t-in-rtf> it might still be collecting coverage that\'s a problem.
2018-10-10T12:04:51 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: May I suggest something?
2018-10-10T12:05:02 <the-t-in-rtf> sure.
2018-10-10T12:06:18 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Comment out these tests: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/feature/QSS1.1/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L122
2018-10-10T12:06:47 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: And line 117 and line 118
2018-10-10T12:07:07 <the-t-in-rtf> will do right after I finish the current experiment
2018-10-10T12:07:18 <the-t-in-rtf> seeing if it makes a difference running the raw source
2018-10-10T12:07:26 <georgitodorov> There is an issue where an Electron\'s webview is destroyed after its enwrapping BrowserWindow
2018-10-10T12:07:42 <georgitodorov> And that is why there are some "Object has been destroyed" errors when the tests finish
2018-10-10T12:08:03 <georgitodorov> It is a well-known Electron issue which has been resolved in later Electron releases
2018-10-10T12:08:27 <jhernandez_> hmmm
2018-10-10T12:09:26 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Previously this wasn\'t an issue and the CI job was running fine. But it may be worth trying.
2018-10-10T12:10:01 <jhernandez_> I\'ve tried to run the tests as CI does by changing into the v:\\ folder and I\'m getting the same hang
2018-10-10T12:10:15 <the-t-in-rtf> interesting.
2018-10-10T12:10:26 <jhernandez_> oh, and that\'s with electron 3
2018-10-10T12:10:29 <jhernandez_> georgitodorov: ^

2018-10-10T12:20:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Same here!  So, for those of you keeping score, the red herring pile now contains instrumentation, reporting, electron versions, and UNC paths.
2018-10-10T12:21:06 <the-t-in-rtf> @georgitodorov, trying your idea now.
2018-10-10T12:28:45 <cindyli> hi georgitodorov, i issued this pull request - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/684 to fix GPII-3437. it still needs more work on writing a test but what\'s in there should fix the problem. can you try it when you have a chance? thanks
2018-10-10T12:31:56 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Sure, I will give it a try shortly
2018-10-10T12:32:31 <cindyli> thanks, georgitodorov
2018-10-10T12:33:38 <the-t-in-rtf> @georgitodorov, it hangs even with those tests commented out.
2018-10-10T12:33:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Trying "the rule of halves" now to see if I can narrow it down.
2018-10-10T12:34:54 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I see

2018-10-10T12:48:17 <the-t-in-rtf> well, that paid off.
2018-10-10T12:48:43 <the-t-in-rtf> npm run test:psp results in a window that won\'t exit.
2018-10-10T12:48:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll confirm that the other two phases of npm test work before narrowing things down further
2018-10-10T12:49:07 <the-t-in-rtf> it could still be something common to all the stages.
2018-10-10T12:52:24 <the-t-in-rtf> npm run gpii:testWindows doesn\'t result in a hang
2018-10-10T12:52:31 <the-t-in-rtf> now checking each part of test:psp
2018-10-10T12:56:10 <the-t-in-rtf> The first three test suites result in a hang, checking the second.
2018-10-10T12:59:09 <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, second three fail.
2018-10-10T12:59:23 <the-t-in-rtf> could be something with the harness itself, checking more variations.
2018-10-10T13:01:33 <the-t-in-rtf> could also be one or more tests in each half, sometimes you have to shuffle your definition of half to narrow things down.

2018-10-10T13:07:39 <the-t-in-rtf> looks like it\'s just the integration tests that result in a hang
2018-10-10T13:08:06 <the-t-in-rtf> or rather, that leave the shell in the state where it can\'t exit

2018-10-10T13:09:40 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Thank you for looking into this. It\'s obviously not related to the coverage and we can examine it further
2018-10-10T13:09:54 <georgitodorov> What should we do in order to get the hand locally?
2018-10-10T13:10:11 <the-t-in-rtf> run the integration tests from either location then try to exit the shell
2018-10-10T13:10:12 * michelled joined the channel
2018-10-10T13:10:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll keep narrowing it down until my next meeting, it\'s no trouble.

2018-10-10T13:18:27 <georgitodorov> When I used "Reset all" for a profile that had all QSS settings changed (language, high contrast, DPI), the high contrast theme remained
2018-10-10T13:18:39 <georgitodorov> Even though the user was successfully keyed out
2018-10-10T13:19:15 <cindyli> which profile is it, georgitodorov
2018-10-10T13:19:25 <georgitodorov> But as I said - I can\'t reproduce it. Also, I think it may be something different which is not related to this issue
2018-10-10T13:19:36 <cindyli> oh, i see
2018-10-10T13:19:52 <georgitodorov> I used "snapset_1b" and added language, high contrast, etc, then saved and keyed out
2018-10-10T13:20:22 <cindyli> ok. let\'s keep an eye on it
2018-10-10T13:20:33 <georgitodorov> cindyli: I think we are good for now. If we find a consistent way to reproduce it, we will let you know
2018-10-10T13:20:49 <cindyli> cool. thanks, georgitodorov

2018-10-10T09:12:48 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! Quick question: Can "jqUnit.expectFrameworkDiagnostic" be used together with other jqUnit.assert statements (e.g. jqUnit.assert, jqUnit.assetTrue)?
2018-10-10T09:13:28 <georgitodorov> I have 1 test which uses jqUnit.expectFrameworkDiagnostic and another one which is just a jqUnit.assert. If run separately, everything is fine
2018-10-10T09:13:54 <georgitodorov> If run together, I get an error: "Expected 2 assertions but 3 were run". Any ideas?
2018-10-10T09:15:13 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - it can, you just need to issue a jqUnit.expect count for any additional assertions you make
2018-10-10T09:15:33 <Bosmon> The rule is, if any jqUnit.expect is issued, the total count must be correct - if you issue none, it doesn\'t matter
2018-10-10T09:15:44 <Bosmon> And expectFrameworkDiagnostic issues one for its own count of 2 assertions
2018-10-10T09:29:01 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-10-10T09:57:01 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I see, thanks!
2018-10-10T09:57:43 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Hey, Tony! Any ideas what is causing the build hang that we talked about yesterday? Or, how it can be debugged?
2018-10-10T09:58:24 <the-t-in-rtf> honestly, not really.
2018-10-10T09:58:36 <the-t-in-rtf> my first thought is, was it something transient, i.e. the CI system acting up.
2018-10-10T09:58:46 <the-t-in-rtf> have subsequent builds had the same problems?
2018-10-10T10:07:33 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I will be pushing shortly and we can see what happens then. There were no subsequent builds for our PR.
2018-10-10T10:08:25 <the-t-in-rtf> link to the PR?
2018-10-10T10:08:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to check a couple of ideas.
2018-10-10T10:09:02 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Here it is: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/62
2018-10-10T10:10:18 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-10-10T10:11:07 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I\'m trying it from my OS X machine to see if I can replicate.
2018-10-10T10:11:10 <the-t-in-rtf> if I can, I have ideas.
2018-10-10T10:11:26 <the-t-in-rtf> if I can\'t, then we keep scratching our heads until a new idea pops out or we have more data.
2018-10-10T10:12:05 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Sounds like a plan. Thank you, Tony!
2018-10-10T10:12:41 <the-t-in-rtf> happy to help, I hate these kinds of problems, they\'re miserable to work on on your own.
2018-10-10T10:13:37 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: If we can help you in some way, let us know
2018-10-10T10:14:48 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-10-10T10:38:07 <jhernandez_> georgitodorov: FYI, yesterday I got similar results locally
2018-10-10T10:38:54 <jhernandez_> this is, not returning after tests are done
2018-10-10T10:44:01 <georgitodorov> jhernandez_, the-t-in-rtf: Did you perform the tests in a VM? Is there anything special about your set-up?
2018-10-10T10:44:18 <the-t-in-rtf> do you use macs or PCs?
2018-10-10T10:44:34 <the-t-in-rtf> usually mine is special in comparison with people using Windows.
2018-10-10T10:44:44 <the-t-in-rtf> (I use a Mac)
2018-10-10T10:44:48 <jhernandez_> georgitodorov: I use the vagrant box
2018-10-10T10:44:53 <the-t-in-rtf> that doesn\'t matter.
2018-10-10T10:44:56 <jhernandez_> the same as CI
2018-10-10T10:44:58 <the-t-in-rtf> the host environment is important.
2018-10-10T10:45:06 <the-t-in-rtf> get that right out of your head, @jhernandez_
2018-10-10T10:45:17 <the-t-in-rtf> the host environment still matters, although it shouldn\'t
2018-10-10T10:45:30 <jhernandez_> why does it matter?
2018-10-10T10:45:33 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s small differences, but it comes up often enough to keep an eye out for
2018-10-10T10:45:46 <the-t-in-rtf> the underlying filesystem the repo\'s code lives in is on the host machien
2018-10-10T10:46:13 <the-t-in-rtf> so it differs subtly depending on whether the host is linux, windows, OS X.
2018-10-10T10:46:45 <the-t-in-rtf> the reason I wanted to run the tests locally is I noticed they were running in the UNC mount on c:/vagrant
2018-10-10T10:47:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to see if I could reproduce the hang running there.
2018-10-10T10:47:12 <the-t-in-rtf> and then see if the problem went away running on the network drive on v:/
2018-10-10T10:48:05 <the-t-in-rtf> my guess is that some of the UNC issues aren\'t as visible if the host OS is also Windows.
2018-10-10T10:48:12 <the-t-in-rtf> but there are other issues that are always visible.
2018-10-10T10:49:26 <jhernandez_> the UNC path might be the source of the problem, but I don\'t see why a VM running on windows or linux or mac makes a real difference as soon as the source code is there
2018-10-10T10:50:00 <jhernandez_> (only talking about the problem we have right now)
2018-10-10T10:50:17 <jhernandez_> I ran the tests inside the vm (without the winrm plugin) and got the same results
2018-10-10T10:50:50 <Bosmon> stegru, I\'ve merged the windows part of GPII-2869
2018-10-10T10:51:30 <Bosmon> I noticed that most of appZoom doesn\'t have test coverage.... could you think of any reasonable way that this could ever be tested?
2018-10-10T10:51:47 <Bosmon> It would be nice to at least have most of the code executed, even if it doesn\'t necessarily do anything in particular
2018-10-10T10:52:17 <the-t-in-rtf> where did you run the tests from, @jhernandez_?
2018-10-10T10:52:27 <the-t-in-rtf> c:/vagrant?
2018-10-10T10:52:33 <jhernandez_> yes
2018-10-10T10:52:35 <jhernandez_> as always
2018-10-10T10:52:37 <jhernandez_> :)
2018-10-10T10:52:38 <the-t-in-rtf> !
2018-10-10T10:52:39 <the-t-in-rtf> NOOOOO
2018-10-10T10:52:46 <Bosmon> NOOOOOOO!
2018-10-10T10:52:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I have surely ranted about this enough by now.
2018-10-10T10:52:49 <Bosmon> KHAAAAANNN!
2018-10-10T10:52:55 <the-t-in-rtf> v for victory, man.
2018-10-10T10:53:12 <jhernandez_> why should I use a remote path when I\'m inside the VM? tthat\'s stupid IMVVVHO
2018-10-10T10:53:13 <the-t-in-rtf> so, I just got enough space free to finish setting up a VM, but maybe you can save me a little time
2018-10-10T10:53:15 <jhernandez_> xDDDD
2018-10-10T10:53:18 <the-t-in-rtf> try v:
2018-10-10T10:53:26 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - "Because it doesn\'t work"
2018-10-10T10:53:27 <the-t-in-rtf> you should use it because c:/vagrant is broken
2018-10-10T10:53:47 <the-t-in-rtf> As soon as I get any bandwidth I will work to get rid of it for the common good.
2018-10-10T10:53:50 <jhernandez_> the only thing that doesn\'t work is the coverage thing
2018-10-10T10:53:55 <the-t-in-rtf> nope
2018-10-10T10:54:01 <the-t-in-rtf> the only thing that doesn\'t work THIS TIME is the coverage
2018-10-10T10:54:16 <the-t-in-rtf> there are other issues.
2018-10-10T10:56:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I\'m a few steps behind you, just confirming that I get the hang in c:/vagrant
2018-10-10T10:56:43 <the-t-in-rtf> there are provisioning steps that run from c:/vagrant, I might need to rerun those before running from v:/ depending
2018-10-10T10:56:51 <the-t-in-rtf> trying to remember the pain points from the coverage work
2018-10-10T10:57:05 <stegru> Bosmon, I\'ll see what I can do about the appZoom coverage.
2018-10-10T10:59:09 <stegru> c:\\vagrant isn\'t "broken" - it\'s the applications that don\'t support it that are broken :)
2018-10-10T11:00:21 <the-t-in-rtf> ha.  Even if we bought PCs for all of the affected devs, we\'d still have to convince them it was worth fixing.
2018-10-10T11:00:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, something like "sharp", which fails on UNC paths is not written on a PC and not with Windows in mind.
2018-10-10T11:01:35 <the-t-in-rtf> not that anyone else uses that, but it\'s the first example that comes to mind.
2018-10-10T11:01:40 <the-t-in-rtf> npm itself also has troubles
2018-10-10T11:01:43 <stegru> sounds like gpii
2018-10-10T11:01:51 <the-t-in-rtf> and if they can\'t be bothered with their giant install base, we don\'t have much hope.
2018-10-10T11:02:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, we have to disable global links because of the UNC paths.
2018-10-10T11:02:13 <the-t-in-rtf> they just work on v:/
2018-10-10T11:03:25 <stegru> it may be possible to just point c:/vagrant to v:/, during the transition
2018-10-10T11:03:38 <the-t-in-rtf> we can try it.
2018-10-10T11:03:54 <the-t-in-rtf> My idea was to put a directory with a polite README in c:/vagrant
2018-10-10T11:04:32 <the-t-in-rtf> or perhaps a small repo that puts up an ASCII drawing that says, "go to v:, friend"
2018-10-10T11:04:38 <the-t-in-rtf> when you run npm commands from there
2018-10-10T11:06:47 <jhernandez_> honestly, I\'ve never understood the problems around c:\\vagrant vs v:\\ since we\'ve always been running the tests from c:\\vagrant until the coverage thing landed
2018-10-10T11:06:57 <jhernandez_> I remember problems in infusion with unc paths
2018-10-10T11:07:14 <the-t-in-rtf> well, there were other problems, we had just already papered over them.
2018-10-10T11:07:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, configuring npm to not install global binaries is also a byproduct of running in c:/vagrant
2018-10-10T11:08:04 <the-t-in-rtf> we just got it working despite the shortcomings and moved on until there was a big enough reason to switch.
2018-10-10T11:08:22 <the-t-in-rtf> and IMO being able to reliably report coverage is enough reason to switch.
2018-10-10T11:09:09 <the-t-in-rtf> And as we\'ve discussed in architecture meetings, there is no use case for actually supporting UNC.
2018-10-10T11:09:19 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s just an artifact of how our VMs were set up.
2018-10-10T11:10:38 <the-t-in-rtf> so, infuriatingly, the coverage doesn\'t hang for me in c:/vagrant.  How did it work out for you, @jhernandez_?
2018-10-10T11:10:57 <the-t-in-rtf> did switching help?
2018-10-10T11:11:09 <jhernandez_> the-t-in-rtf: running now
2018-10-10T11:11:12 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks.

2018-10-10T11:12:28 <the-t-in-rtf> unlike universal, this one takes less than a minute, so you can run it a few times

2018-10-10T11:32:40 <jhernandez_> okay, v: for victory
2018-10-10T11:32:50 <jhernandez_> it didn\'t hang
2018-10-10T11:33:05 <jhernandez_> :D
2018-10-10T11:33:07 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s really bizarre, I can\'t get it to hang in c:/vagrant, but it\'s something to try.
2018-10-10T11:33:22 <jhernandez_> yeah, very weird
2018-10-10T11:33:29 <the-t-in-rtf> pro tip, you can test just the coverage reporting using npm run posttest
2018-10-10T11:33:36 <the-t-in-rtf> so you don\'t have to wait for a full run.
